That\r\nlife, if there is anything in heredity, is very far from finished; and\r\nwhile it continues there will be new achievement.\r\n\r\nAn insistently expressed desire on the part of the public for a\r\ndefinitive biography of Edison was the reason for the following pages.\r\nThe present authors deem themselves happy in the confidence reposed in\r\nthem, and in the constant assistance they have enjoyed from Mr. Edison\r\nwhile preparing these pages, a great many of which are altogether\r\nhis own. This co-operation in no sense relieves the authors of\r\nresponsibility as to any of the views or statements of their own that\r\nthe book contains. They have realized the extreme reluctance of Mr.\r\nEdison to be made the subject of any biography at all; while he has felt\r\nthat, if it must be written, it were best done by the hands of friends\r\nand associates of long standing, whose judgment and discretion he could\r\ntrust, and whose intimate knowledge of the facts would save him from\r\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the book are profoundly conscious of the fact that the\r\nextraordinary period of electrical development embraced in it has been\r\nprolific of great men. They have named some of them; but there has\r\nbeen no idea of setting forth various achievements or of ascribing\r\ndistinctive merits. This treatment is devoted to one man whom his\r\nfellow-citizens have chosen to regard as in many ways representative of\r\nthe American at his finest flowering in the field of invention during\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is designed in these pages to bring the reader face to face with\r\nEdison; to glance at an interesting childhood and a youthful period\r\nmarked by a capacity for doing things, and by an insatiable thirst for\r\nknowledge; then to accompany him into the great creative stretch of\r\nforty years, during which he has done so much. This book shows him\r\nplunged deeply into work for which he has always had an incredible\r\ncapacity, reveals the exercise of his unsurpassed inventive ability, his\r\nkeen reasoning powers, his tenacious memory, his fertility of resource;\r\nfollows him through a series of innumerable experiments, conducted\r\nmethodically, reaching out like rays of search-light into all the\r\nregions of science and nature, and finally exhibits him emerging\r\ntriumphantly from countless difficulties bearing with him in new arts\r\nthe fruits of victorious struggle.\r\n\r\nThese volumes aim to be a biography rather than a history of\r\nelectricity, but they have had to cover so much general ground in\r\ndefining the relations and contributions of Edison to the electrical\r\narts, that they serve to present a picture of the whole development\r\neffected in the last fifty years, the most fruitful that electricity has\r\nknown. The effort has been made to avoid technique and abstruse phrases,\r\nbut some degree of explanation has been absolutely necessary in regard\r\nto each group of inventions. The task of the authors has consisted\r\nlargely in summarizing fairly the methods and processes employed by\r\nEdison; and some idea of the difficulties encountered by them in\r\nso doing may be realized from the fact that one brief chapter, for\r\nexample,--that on ore milling--covers nine years of most intense\r\napplication and activity on the part of the inventor. It is something\r\nlike exhibiting the geological eras of the earth in an outline lantern\r\nslide, to reduce an elaborate series of strenuous experiments and a vast\r\nvariety of ingenious apparatus to the space of a few hundred words.\r\n\r\nA great deal of this narrative is given in Mr. Edison's own language,\r\nfrom oral or written statements made in reply to questions addressed to\r\nhim with the object of securing accuracy. A further large part is based\r\nupon the personal contributions of many loyal associates; and it is\r\ndesired here to make grateful acknowledgment to such collaborators as\r\nMessrs. Samuel Insull, E. H. Johnson, F. R. Upton, R. N Dyer, S. B.\r\nEaton, Francis Jehl, W. S. Andrews, W. J. Jenks, W. J. Hammer, F. J.\r\nSprague, W. S. Mallory, and C. L. Clarke, and others, without whose\r\naid the issuance of this book would indeed have been impossible. In\r\nparticular, it is desired to acknowledge indebtedness to Mr. W. H.\r\nMeadowcroft not only for substantial aid in the literary part of the\r\nwork, but for indefatigable effort to group, classify, and summarize the\r\nboundless material embodied in Edison's note-books and memorabilia of\r\nall kinds now kept at the Orange laboratory. Acknowledgment must also\r\nbe made of the courtesy and assistance of Mrs. Edison, and especially\r\nof the loan of many interesting and rare photographs from her private\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDISON HIS LIFE AND INVENTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\nTHE year 1847 marked a period of great territorial acquisition by\r\nthe American people, with incalculable additions to their actual and\r\npotential wealth. By the rational compromise with England in the dispute\r\nover the Oregon region, President Polk had secured during 1846, for\r\nundisturbed settlement, three hundred thousand square miles of forest,\r\nfertile land, and fisheries, including the whole fair Columbia Valley.\r\nOur active \"policy of the Pacific\" dated from that hour. With swift and\r\nclinching succession came the melodramatic Mexican War, and February,\r\n1848, saw another vast territory south of Oregon and west of the Rocky\r\nMountains added by treaty to the United States. Thus in about eighteen\r\nmonths there had been pieced into the national domain for quick\r\ndevelopment and exploitation a region as large as the entire Union\r\nof Thirteen States at the close of the War of Independence. Moreover,\r\nwithin its boundaries was embraced all the great American gold-field,\r\njust on the eve of discovery, for Marshall had detected the shining\r\nparticles in the mill-race at the foot of the Sierra Nevada nine days\r\nbefore Mexico signed away her rights in California and in all the vague,\r\nremote hinterland facing Cathayward.\r\n\r\nEqually momentous were the times in Europe, where the attempt to secure\r\nopportunities of expansion as well as larger liberty for the individual\r\ntook quite different form. The old absolutist system of government was\r\nfast breaking up, and ancient thrones were tottering. The red lava of\r\ndeep revolutionary fires oozed up through many glowing cracks in the\r\npolitical crust, and all the social strata were shaken. That the wild\r\noutbursts of insurrection midway in the fifth decade failed and died\r\naway was not surprising, for the superincumbent deposits of tradition\r\nand convention were thick. But the retrospect indicates that many\r\nreforms and political changes were accomplished, although the process\r\ninvolved the exile of not a few ardent spirits to America, to become\r\nleading statesmen, inventors, journalists, and financiers. In 1847, too,\r\nRussia began her tremendous march eastward into Central Asia, just\r\nas France was solidifying her first gains on the littoral of northern\r\nAfrica. In England the fierce fervor of the Chartist movement, with its\r\nviolent rhetoric as to the rights of man, was sobering down and passing\r\npervasively into numerous practical schemes for social and political\r\namelioration, constituting in their entirety a most profound change\r\nthroughout every part of the national life.\r\n\r\nInto such times Thomas Alva Edison was born, and his relations to\r\nthem and to the events of the past sixty years are the subject of\r\nthis narrative. Aside from the personal interest that attaches to the\r\npicturesque career, so typically American, there is a broader aspect in\r\nwhich the work of the \"Franklin of the Nineteenth Century\" touches\r\nthe welfare and progress of the race. It is difficult at any time to\r\ndetermine the effect of any single invention, and the investigation\r\nbecomes more difficult where inventions of the first class have been\r\ncrowded upon each other in rapid and bewildering succession. But it will\r\nbe admitted that in Edison one deals with a central figure of the great\r\nage that saw the invention and introduction in practical form of the\r\ntelegraph, the submarine cable, the telephone, the electric light, the\r\nelectric railway, the electric trolley-car, the storage battery, the\r\nelectric motor, the phonograph, the wireless telegraph; and that the\r\ninfluence of these on the world's affairs has not been excelled at\r\nany time by that of any other corresponding advances in the arts and\r\nsciences. These pages deal with Edison's share in the great work of the\r\nlast half century in abridging distance, communicating intelligence,\r\nlessening toil, improving illumination, recording forever the human\r\nvoice; and on behalf of inventive genius it may be urged that its\r\nbeneficent results and gifts to mankind compare with any to be credited\r\nto statesman, warrior, or creative writer of the same period.\r\n\r\nViewed from the standpoint of inventive progress, the first half of\r\nthe nineteenth century had passed very profitably when Edison\r\nappeared--every year marked by some notable achievement in the arts and\r\nsciences, with promise of its early and abundant fruition in commerce\r\nand industry. There had been exactly four decades of steam navigation\r\non American waters. Railways were growing at the rate of nearly\r\none thousand miles annually. Gas had become familiar as a means of\r\nillumination in large cities. Looms and tools and printing-presses were\r\neverywhere being liberated from the slow toil of man-power. The first\r\nphotographs had been taken. Chloroform, nitrous oxide gas, and ether\r\nhad been placed at the service of the physician in saving life, and\r\nthe revolver, guncotton, and nitroglycerine added to the agencies for\r\nslaughter. New metals, chemicals, and elements had become available in\r\nlarge numbers, gases had been liquefied and solidified, and the range\r\nof useful heat and cold indefinitely extended. The safety-lamp had been\r\ngiven to the miner, the caisson to the bridge-builder, the anti-friction\r\nmetal to the mechanic for bearings. It was already known how to\r\nvulcanize rubber, and how to galvanize iron. The application of\r\nmachinery in the harvest-field had begun with the embryonic reaper,\r\nwhile both the bicycle and the automobile were heralded in primitive\r\nprototypes. The gigantic expansion of the iron and steel industry was\r\nforeshadowed in the change from wood to coal in the smelting furnaces.\r\nThe sewing-machine had brought with it, like the friction match, one of\r\nthe most profound influences in modifying domestic life, and making it\r\ndifferent from that of all preceding time.\r\n\r\nEven in 1847 few of these things had lost their novelty, most of them\r\nwere in the earlier stages of development. But it is when we turn to\r\nelectricity that the rich virgin condition of an illimitable new kingdom\r\nof discovery is seen. Perhaps the word \"utilization\" or \"application\" is\r\nbetter than discovery, for then, as now, an endless wealth of phenomena\r\nnoted by experimenters from Gilbert to Franklin and Faraday awaited the\r\ninvention that could alone render them useful to mankind. The eighteenth\r\ncentury, keenly curious and ceaselessly active in this fascinating field\r\nof investigation, had not, after all, left much of a legacy in either\r\nprinciples or appliances. The lodestone and the compass; the frictional\r\nmachine; the Leyden jar; the nature of conductors and insulators;\r\nthe identity of electricity and the thunder-storm flash; the use of\r\nlightning-rods; the physiological effects of an electrical shock--these\r\nconstituted the bulk of the bequest to which philosophers were the only\r\nheirs. Pregnant with possibilities were many of the observations that\r\nhad been recorded. But these few appliances made up the meagre kit\r\nof tools with which the nineteenth century entered upon its task of\r\nacquiring the arts and conveniences now such an intimate part of \"human\r\nnature's daily food\" that the average American to-day pays more for his\r\nelectrical service than he does for bread.\r\n\r\nWith the first year of the new century came Volta's invention of the\r\nchemical battery as a means of producing electricity. A well-known\r\nItalian picture represents Volta exhibiting his apparatus before the\r\nyoung conqueror Napoleon, then ravishing from the Peninsula its treasure\r\nof ancient art and founding an ephemeral empire. At such a moment this\r\ngift of despoiled Italy to the world was a noble revenge, setting in\r\nmotion incalculable beneficent forces and agencies. For the first\r\ntime man had command of a steady supply of electricity without toil or\r\neffort. The useful results obtainable previously from the current of a\r\nfrictional machine were not much greater than those to be derived from\r\nthe flight of a rocket. While the frictional appliance is still\r\nemployed in medicine, it ranks with the flint axe and the tinder-box\r\nin industrial obsolescence. No art or trade could be founded on it; no\r\ndiminution of daily work or increase of daily comfort could be secured\r\nwith it. But the little battery with its metal plates in a weak\r\nsolution proved a perennial reservoir of electrical energy, safe and\r\ncontrollable, from which supplies could be drawn at will. That which was\r\nwild had become domesticated; regular crops took the place of haphazard\r\ngleanings from brake or prairie; the possibility of electrical\r\nstarvation was forever left behind.\r\n\r\nImmediately new processes of inestimable value revealed themselves; new\r\nmethods were suggested. Almost all the electrical arts now employed\r\nmade their beginnings in the next twenty-five years, and while the more\r\nextensive of them depend to-day on the dynamo for electrical energy,\r\nsome of the most important still remain in loyal allegiance to the older\r\nsource. The battery itself soon underwent modifications, and new types\r\nwere evolved--the storage, the double-fluid, and the dry. Various\r\nanalogies next pointed to the use of heat, and the thermoelectric cell\r\nemerged, embodying the application of flame to the junction of two\r\ndifferent metals. Davy, of the safety-lamp, threw a volume of current\r\nacross the gap between two sticks of charcoal, and the voltaic arc,\r\nforerunner of electric lighting, shed its bright beams upon a dazzled\r\nworld. The decomposition of water by electrolytic action was recognized\r\nand made the basis of communicating at a distance even before the days\r\nof the electromagnet. The ties that bind electricity and magnetism in\r\ntwinship of relation and interaction were detected, and Faraday's work\r\nin induction gave the world at once the dynamo and the motor. \"Hitch\r\nyour wagon to a star,\" said Emerson. To all the coal-fields and all the\r\nwaterfalls Faraday had directly hitched the wheels of industry. Not\r\nonly was it now possible to convert mechanical energy into electricity\r\ncheaply and in illimitable quantities, but electricity at once showed\r\nits ubiquitous availability as a motive power. Boats were propelled by\r\nit, cars were hauled, and even papers printed. Electroplating became\r\nan art, and telegraphy sprang into active being on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nAt the time Edison was born, in 1847, telegraphy, upon which he was to\r\nleave so indelible an imprint, had barely struggled into acceptance by\r\nthe public. In England, Wheatstone and Cooke had introduced a ponderous\r\nmagnetic needle telegraph. In America, in 1840, Morse had taken out his\r\nfirst patent on an electromagnetic telegraph, the principle of which\r\nis dominating in the art to this day. Four years later the memorable\r\nmessage \"What hath God wrought!\" was sent by young Miss Ellsworth over\r\nhis circuits, and incredulous Washington was advised by wire of the\r\naction of the Democratic Convention in Baltimore in nominating Polk.\r\nBy 1847 circuits had been strung between Washington and New York, under\r\nprivate enterprise, the Government having declined to buy the Morse\r\nsystem for $100,000. Everything was crude and primitive. The poles were\r\ntwo hundred feet apart and could barely hold up a wash-line. The slim,\r\nbare, copper wire snapped on the least provocation, and the circuit\r\nwas \"down\" for thirty-six days in the first six months. The little\r\nglass-knob insulators made seductive targets for ignorant sportsmen.\r\nAttempts to insulate the line wire were limited to coating it with\r\ntar or smearing it with wax for the benefit of all the bees in the\r\nneighborhood. The farthest western reach of the telegraph lines in\r\n1847 was Pittsburg, with three-ply iron wire mounted on square glass\r\ninsulators with a little wooden pentroof for protection. In that office,\r\nwhere Andrew Carnegie was a messenger boy, the magnets in use to receive\r\nthe signals sent with the aid of powerful nitric-acid batteries weighed\r\nas much as seventy-five pounds apiece. But the business was fortunately\r\nsmall at the outset, until the new device, patronized chiefly by\r\nlottery-men, had proved its utility. Then came the great outburst of\r\nactivity. Within a score of years telegraph wires covered the whole\r\noccupied country with a network, and the first great electrical industry\r\nwas a pronounced success, yielding to its pioneers the first great\r\nharvest of electrical fortunes. It had been a sharp struggle for bare\r\nexistence, during which such a man as the founder of Cornell University\r\nhad been glad to get breakfast in New York with a quarter-dollar picked\r\nup on Broadway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEDISON'S PEDIGREE\r\n\r\nTHOMAS ALVA EDISON was born at Milan Ohio, February 11, 1847. The State\r\nthat rivals Virginia as a \"Mother of Presidents\" has evidently other\r\ntitles to distinction of the same nature. For picturesque detail it\r\nwould not be easy to find any story excelling that of the Edison family\r\nbefore it reached the Western Reserve. The story epitomizes American\r\nidealism, restlessness, freedom of individual opinion, and ready\r\nadjustment to the surrounding conditions of pioneer life. The ancestral\r\nEdisons who came over from Holland, as nearly as can be determined, in\r\n1730, were descendants of extensive millers on the Zuyder Zee, and took\r\nup patents of land along the Passaic River, New Jersey, close to the\r\nhome that Mr. Edison established in the Orange Mountains a hundred and\r\nsixty years later. They landed at Elizabethport, New Jersey, and first\r\nsettled near Caldwell in that State, where some graves of the family may\r\nstill be found. President Cleveland was born in that quiet hamlet. It is\r\na curious fact that in the Edison family the pronunciation of the name\r\nhas always been with the long \"e\" sound, as it would naturally be in\r\nthe Dutch language. The family prospered and must have enjoyed public\r\nconfidence, for we find the name of Thomas Edison, as a bank official on\r\nManhattan Island, signed to Continental currency in 1778. According\r\nto the family records this Edison, great-grandfather of Thomas Alva,\r\nreached the extreme old age of 104 years. But all was not well, and,\r\nas has happened so often before, the politics of father and son were\r\nviolently different. The Loyalist movement that took to Nova Scotia so\r\nmany Americans after the War of Independence carried with it John, the\r\nson of this stalwart Continental. Thus it came about that Samuel Edison,\r\nson of John, was born at Digby, Nova Scotia, in 1804. Seven years later\r\nJohn Edison who, as a Loyalist or United Empire emigrant, had become\r\nentitled under the laws of Canada to a grant of six hundred acres of\r\nland, moved westward to take possession of this property. He made his\r\nway through the State of New York in wagons drawn by oxen to the remote\r\nand primitive township of Bayfield, in Upper Canada, on Lake Huron.\r\nAlthough the journey occurred in balmy June, it was necessarily attended\r\nwith difficulty and privation; but the new home was situated in good\r\nfarming country, and once again this interesting nomadic family settled\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nJohn Edison moved from Bayfield to Vienna, Ontario, on the northern bank\r\nof Lake Erie. Mr. Edison supplies an interesting reminiscence of the old\r\nman and his environment in those early Canadian days. \"When I was five\r\nyears old I was taken by my father and mother on a visit to Vienna. We\r\nwere driven by carriage from Milan, Ohio, to a railroad, then to a\r\nport on Lake Erie, thence by a canal-boat in a tow of several to Port\r\nBurwell, in Canada, across the lake, and from there we drove to Vienna,\r\na short distance away. I remember my grandfather perfectly as he\r\nappeared, at 102 years of age, when he died. In the middle of the day\r\nhe sat under a large tree in front of the house facing a well-travelled\r\nroad. His head was covered completely with a large quantity of very\r\nwhite hair, and he chewed tobacco incessantly, nodding to friends as\r\nthey passed by. He used a very large cane, and walked from the chair to\r\nthe house, resenting any assistance. I viewed him from a distance, and\r\ncould never get very close to him. I remember some large pipes, and\r\nespecially a molasses jug, a trunk, and several other things that came\r\nfrom Holland.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Edison was long-lived, like his father, and reached the ripe old\r\nage of 102, leaving his son Samuel charged with the care of the family\r\ndestinies, but with no great burden of wealth. Little is known of the\r\nearly manhood of this father of T. A. Edison until we find him keeping a\r\nhotel at Vienna, marrying a school-teacher there (Miss Nancy Elliott, in\r\n1828), and taking a lively share in the troublous politics of the time.\r\nHe was six feet in height, of great bodily vigor, and of such personal\r\ndominance of character that he became a captain of the insurgent forces\r\nrallying under the banners of Papineau and Mackenzie. The opening\r\nyears of Queen Victoria's reign witnessed a belated effort in Canada\r\nto emphasize the principle that there should not be taxation without\r\nrepresentation; and this descendant of those who had left the United\r\nStates from disapproval of such a doctrine, flung himself headlong into\r\nits support.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of Earl Durham, who pacified Canada at this time and\r\nestablished the present system of government, that he made a country\r\nand marred a career. But the immediate measures of repression enforced\r\nbefore a liberal policy was adopted were sharp and severe, and Samuel\r\nEdison also found his own career marred on Canadian soil as one result\r\nof the Durham administration. Exile to Bermuda with other insurgents was\r\nnot so attractive as the perils of a flight to the United States. A very\r\nhurried departure was effected in secret from the scene of trouble, and\r\nthere are romantic traditions of his thrilling journey of one hundred\r\nand eighty-two miles toward safety, made almost entirely without food\r\nor sleep, through a wild country infested with Indians of unfriendly\r\ndisposition. Thus was the Edison family repatriated by a picturesque\r\npolitical episode, and the great inventor given a birthplace on American\r\nsoil, just as was Benjamin Franklin when his father came from England\r\nto Boston. Samuel Edison left behind him, however, in Canada, several\r\nbrothers, all of whom lived to the age of ninety or more, and from whom\r\nthere are descendants in the region.\r\n\r\nAfter some desultory wanderings for a year or two along the shores of\r\nLake Erie, among the prosperous towns then springing up, the family,\r\nwith its Canadian home forfeited, and in quest of another resting-place,\r\ncame to Milan, Ohio, in 1842. That pretty little village offered at the\r\nmoment many attractions as a possible Chicago. The railroad system of\r\nOhio was still in the future, but the Western Reserve had already become\r\na vast wheat-field, and huge quantities of grain from the central and\r\nnorthern counties sought shipment to Eastern ports. The Huron River,\r\nemptying into Lake Erie, was navigable within a few miles of the\r\nvillage, and provided an admirable outlet. Large granaries were\r\nestablished, and proved so successful that local capital was tempted\r\ninto the project of making a tow-path canal from Lockwood Landing all\r\nthe way to Milan itself. The quaint old Moravian mission and quondam\r\nIndian settlement of one hundred inhabitants found itself of a sudden\r\none of the great grain ports of the world, and bidding fair to rival\r\nRussian Odessa. A number of grain warehouses, or primitive elevators,\r\nwere built along the bank of the canal, and the produce of the region\r\npoured in immediately, arriving in wagons drawn by four or six horses\r\nwith loads of a hundred bushels. No fewer than six hundred wagons came\r\nclattering in, and as many as twenty sail vessels were loaded with\r\nthirty-five thousand bushels of grain, during a single day. The canal\r\nwas capable of being navigated by craft of from two hundred to two\r\nhundred and fifty tons burden, and the demand for such vessels soon\r\nled to the development of a brisk ship-building industry, for which\r\nthe abundant forests of the region supplied the necessary lumber. An\r\nevidence of the activity in this direction is furnished by the fact that\r\nsix revenue cutters were launched at this port in these brisk days of\r\nits prime.\r\n\r\nSamuel Edison, versatile, buoyant of temper, and ever optimistic, would\r\nthus appear to have pitched his tent with shrewd judgment. There was\r\nplenty of occupation ready to his hand, and more than one enterprise\r\nreceived his attention; but he devoted his energies chiefly to the\r\nmaking of shingles, for which there was a large demand locally and along\r\nthe lake. Canadian lumber was used principally in this industry. The\r\nwood was imported in \"bolts\" or pieces three feet long. A bolt made two\r\nshingles; it was sawn asunder by hand, then split and shaved. None but\r\nfirst-class timber was used, and such shingles outlasted far those made\r\nby machinery with their cross-grain cut. A house in Milan, on which some\r\nof those shingles were put in 1844, was still in excellent condition\r\nforty-two years later. Samuel Edison did well at this occupation, and\r\nemployed several men, but there were other outlets from time to time for\r\nhis business activity and speculative disposition.\r\n\r\nEdison's mother was an attractive and highly educated woman, whose\r\ninfluence upon his disposition and intellect has been profound and\r\nlasting. She was born in Chenango County, New York, in 1810, and was the\r\ndaughter of the Rev. John Elliott, a Baptist minister and descendant of\r\nan old Revolutionary soldier, Capt. Ebenezer Elliott, of Scotch descent.\r\nThe old captain was a fine and picturesque type. He fought all through\r\nthe long War of Independence--seven years--and then appears to have\r\nsettled down at Stonington, Connecticut. There, at any rate, he found\r\nhis wife, \"grandmother Elliott,\" who was Mercy Peckham, daughter of a\r\nScotch Quaker. Then came the residence in New York State, with final\r\nremoval to Vienna, for the old soldier, while drawing his pension at\r\nBuffalo, lived in the little Canadian town, and there died, over 100\r\nyears old. The family was evidently one of considerable culture and deep\r\nreligious feeling, for two of Mrs. Edison's uncles and two brothers were\r\nalso in the same Baptist ministry. As a young woman she became a teacher\r\nin the public high school at Vienna, and thus met her husband, who was\r\nresiding there. The family never consisted of more than three children,\r\ntwo boys and a girl. A trace of the Canadian environment is seen in the\r\nfact that Edison's elder brother was named William Pitt, after the\r\ngreat English statesman. Both his brother and the sister exhibited\r\nconsiderable ability. William Pitt Edison as a youth was so clever with\r\nhis pencil that it was proposed to send him to Paris as an art student.\r\nIn later life he was manager of the local street railway lines at Port\r\nHuron, Michigan, in which he was heavily interested. He also owned a\r\ngood farm near that town, and during the ill-health at the close of\r\nhis life, when compelled to spend much of the time indoors, he devoted\r\nhimself almost entirely to sketching. It has been noted by intimate\r\nobservers of Thomas A. Edison that in discussing any project or new idea\r\nhis first impulse is to take up any piece of paper available and make\r\ndrawings of it. His voluminous note-books are a mass of sketches.\r\nMrs-Tannie Edison Bailey, the sister, had, on the other hand, a great\r\ndeal of literary ability, and spent much of her time in writing.\r\n\r\nThe great inventor, whose iron endurance and stern will have enabled him\r\nto wear down all his associates by work sustained through arduous days\r\nand sleepless nights, was not at all strong as a child, and was of\r\nfragile appearance. He had an abnormally large but well-shaped head, and\r\nit is said that the local doctors feared he might have brain trouble.\r\nIn fact, on account of his assumed delicacy, he was not allowed to go to\r\nschool for some years, and even when he did attend for a short time\r\nthe results were not encouraging--his mother being hotly indignant upon\r\nhearing that the teacher had spoken of him to an inspector as \"addled.\"\r\nThe youth was, indeed, fortunate far beyond the ordinary in having a\r\nmother at once loving, well-informed, and ambitious, capable herself,\r\nfrom her experience as a teacher, of undertaking and giving him an\r\neducation better than could be secured in the local schools of the day.\r\nCertain it is that under this simple regime studious habits were formed\r\nand a taste for literature developed that have lasted to this day. If\r\never there was a man who tore the heart out of books it is Edison, and\r\nwhat has once been read by him is never forgotten if useful or worthy of\r\nsubmission to the test of experiment.\r\n\r\nBut even thus early the stronger love of mechanical processes and of\r\nprobing natural forces manifested itself. Edison has said that he\r\nnever saw a statement in any book as to such things that he did not\r\ninvoluntarily challenge, and wish to demonstrate as either right or\r\nwrong. As a mere child the busy scenes of the canal and the grain\r\nwarehouses were of consuming interest, but the work in the ship-building\r\nyards had an irresistible fascination. His questions were so ceaseless\r\nand innumerable that the penetrating curiosity of an unusually strong\r\nmind was regarded as deficiency in powers of comprehension, and the\r\nfather himself, a man of no mean ingenuity and ability, reports that\r\nthe child, although capable of reducing him to exhaustion by endless\r\ninquiries, was often spoken of as rather wanting in ordinary acumen.\r\nThis apparent dulness is, however, a quite common incident to youthful\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThe constructive tendencies of this child of whom his father said once\r\nthat he had never had any boyhood days in the ordinary sense, were early\r\nnoted in his fondness for building little plank roads out of the debris\r\nof the yards and mills. His extraordinarily retentive memory was shown\r\nin his easy acquisition of all the songs of the lumber gangs and canal\r\nmen before he was five years old. One incident tells how he was found\r\none day in the village square copying laboriously the signs of the\r\nstores. A highly characteristic event at the age of six is described by\r\nhis sister. He had noted a goose sitting on her eggs and the result. One\r\nday soon after, he was missing. By-and-by, after an anxious search, his\r\nfather found him sitting in a nest he had made in the barn, filled with\r\ngoose-eggs and hens' eggs he had collected, trying to hatch them out.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Edison's most vivid recollections goes back to 1850, when as\r\na child three of four years old he saw camped in front of his home six\r\ncovered wagons, \"prairie schooners,\" and witnessed their departure for\r\nCalifornia. The great excitement over the gold discoveries was thus felt\r\nin Milan, and these wagons, laden with all the worldly possessions of\r\ntheir owners, were watched out of sight on their long journey by this\r\nfascinated urchin, whose own discoveries in later years were to tempt\r\nmany other argonauts into the auriferous realms of electricity.\r\n\r\nAnother vivid memory of this period concerns his first realization\r\nof the grim mystery of death. He went off one day with the son of\r\nthe wealthiest man in the town to bathe in the creek. Soon after they\r\nentered the water the other boy disappeared. Young Edison waited around\r\nthe spot for half an hour or more, and then, as it was growing dark,\r\nwent home puzzled and lonely, but silent as to the occurrence. About two\r\nhours afterward, when the missing boy was being searched for, a man came\r\nto the Edison home to make anxious inquiry of the companion with whom\r\nhe had last been seen. Edison told all the circumstances with a painful\r\nsense of being in some way implicated. The creek was at once dragged,\r\nand then the body was recovered.\r\n\r\nEdison had himself more than one narrow escape. Of course he fell in the\r\ncanal and was nearly drowned; few boys in Milan worth their salt omitted\r\nthat performance. On another occasion he encountered a more novel peril\r\nby falling into the pile of wheat in a grain elevator and being almost\r\nsmothered. Holding the end of a skate-strap for another lad to shorten\r\nwith an axe, he lost the top of a finger. Fire also had its perils. He\r\nbuilt a fire in a barn, but the flames spread so rapidly that, although\r\nhe escaped himself, the barn was wholly destroyed, and he was publicly\r\nwhipped in the village square as a warning to other youths. Equally well\r\nremembered is a dangerous encounter with a ram that attacked him while\r\nhe was busily engaged digging out a bumblebee's nest near an orchard\r\nfence. The animal knocked him against the fence, and was about to butt\r\nhim again when he managed to drop over on the safe side and escape. He\r\nwas badly hurt and bruised, and no small quantity of arnica was needed\r\nfor his wounds.\r\n\r\nMeantime little Milan had reached the zenith of its prosperity, and all\r\nof a sudden had been deprived of its flourishing grain trade by the new\r\nColumbus, Sandusky & Hocking Railroad; in fact, the short canal was one\r\nof the last efforts of its kind in this country to compete with the\r\nnew means of transportation. The bell of the locomotive was everywhere\r\nringing the death-knell of effective water haulage, with such dire\r\nresults that, in 1880, of the 4468 miles of American freight canal, that\r\nhad cost $214,000,000, no fewer than 1893 miles had been abandoned,\r\nand of the remaining 2575 miles quite a large proportion was not paying\r\nexpenses. The short Milan canal suffered with the rest, and to-day\r\nlies well-nigh obliterated, hidden in part by vegetable gardens, a mere\r\ngrass-grown depression at the foot of the winding, shallow valley. Other\r\nrailroads also prevented any further competition by the canal, for a\r\nbranch of the Wheeling & Lake Erie now passes through the village, while\r\nthe Lake Shore & Michigan Southern runs a few miles to the south.\r\n\r\nThe owners of the canal soon had occasion to regret that they had\r\ndisdained the overtures of enterprising railroad promoters desirous\r\nof reaching the village, and the consequences of commercial isolation\r\nrapidly made themselves felt. It soon became evident to Samuel Edison\r\nand his wife that the cozy brick home on the bluff must be given up\r\nand the struggle with fortune resumed elsewhere. They were well-to-do,\r\nhowever, and removing, in 1854, to Port Huron, Michigan, occupied a\r\nlarge colonial house standing in the middle of an old Government fort\r\nreservation of ten acres overlooking the wide expanse of the St. Clair\r\nRiver just after it leaves Lake Huron. It was in many ways an ideal\r\nhomestead, toward which the family has always felt the strongest\r\nattachment, but the association with Milan has never wholly ceased. The\r\nold house in which Edison was born is still occupied (in 1910) by Mr.\r\nS. O. Edison, a half-brother of Edison's father, and a man of marked\r\ninventive ability. He was once prominent in the iron-furnace industry of\r\nOhio, and was for a time associated in the iron trade with the father\r\nof the late President McKinley. Among his inventions may be mentioned a\r\nmachine for making fuel from wheat straw, and a smoke-consuming device.\r\n\r\nThis birthplace of Edison remains the plain, substantial little brick\r\nhouse it was originally: one-storied, with rooms finished on the attic\r\nfloor. Being built on the hillside, its basement opens into the rear\r\nyard. It was at first heated by means of open coal grates, which may not\r\nhave been altogether adequate in severe winters, owing to the altitude\r\nand the north-eastern exposure, but a large furnace is one of the more\r\nmodern changes. Milan itself is not materially unlike the smaller Ohio\r\ntowns of its own time or those of later creation, but the venerable\r\nappearance of the big elm-trees that fringe the trim lawns tells of its\r\nage. It is, indeed, an extremely neat, snug little place, with well-kept\r\nhomes, mostly of frame construction, and flagged streets crossing\r\neach other at right angles. There are no poor--at least, everybody is\r\napparently well-to-do. While a leisurely atmosphere pervades the\r\ntown, few idlers are seen. Some of the residents are engaged in local\r\nbusiness; some are occupied in farming and grape culture; others are\r\nemployed in the iron-works near-by, at Norwalk. The stores and places\r\nof public resort are gathered about the square, where there is plenty\r\nof room for hitching when the Saturday trading is done at that point,\r\nat which periods the fitful bustle recalls the old wheat days when young\r\nEdison ran with curiosity among the six and eight horse teams that had\r\nbrought in grain. This square is still covered with fine primeval forest\r\ntrees, and has at its centre a handsome soldiers' monument of the Civil\r\nWar, to which four paved walks converge. It is an altogether pleasant\r\nand unpretentious town, which cherishes with no small amount of pride\r\nits association with the name of Thomas Alva Edison.\r\n\r\nIn view of Edison's Dutch descent, it is rather singular to find him\r\nwith the name of Alva, for the Spanish Duke of Alva was notoriously the\r\nworst tyrant ever known to the Low Countries, and his evil deeds occupy\r\nmany stirring pages in Motley's famous history. As a matter of fact,\r\nEdison was named after Capt. Alva Bradley, an old friend of his father,\r\nand a celebrated ship-owner on the Lakes. Captain Bradley died a few\r\nyears ago in wealth, while his old associate, with equal ability for\r\nmaking money, was never able long to keep it (differing again from the\r\nRevolutionary New York banker from whom his son's other name, \"Thomas,\"\r\nwas taken).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBOYHOOD AT PORT HURON, MICHIGAN\r\n\r\nTHE new home found by the Edison family at Port Huron, where Alva spent\r\nhis brief boyhood before he became a telegraph operator and roamed the\r\nwhole middle West of that period, was unfortunately destroyed by fire\r\njust after the close of the Civil War. A smaller but perhaps more\r\ncomfortable home was then built by Edison's father on some property he\r\nhad bought at the near-by village of Gratiot, and there his mother spent\r\nthe remainder of her life in confirmed invalidism, dying in 1871. Hence\r\nthe pictures and postal cards sold largely to souvenir-hunters as the\r\nPort Huron home do not actually show that in or around which the events\r\nnow referred to took place.\r\n\r\nIt has been a romance of popular biographers, based upon the fact that\r\nEdison began his career as a newsboy, to assume that these earlier years\r\nwere spent in poverty and privation, as indeed they usually are by the\r\n\"newsies\" who swarm and shout their papers in our large cities. While\r\nit seems a pity to destroy this erroneous idea, suggestive of a heroic\r\nclimb from the depths to the heights, nothing could be further from the\r\ntruth. Socially the Edison family stood high in Port Huron at a time\r\nwhen there was relatively more wealth and general activity than to-day.\r\nThe town in its pristine prime was a great lumber centre, and hummed\r\nwith the industry of numerous sawmills. An incredible quantity of\r\nlumber was made there yearly until the forests near-by vanished and the\r\nindustry with them. The wealth of the community, invested largely in\r\nthis business and in allied transportation companies, was accumulated\r\nrapidly and as freely spent during those days of prosperity in St. Clair\r\nCounty, bringing with it a high standard of domestic comfort. In all\r\nthis the Edisons shared on equal terms.\r\n\r\nThus, contrary to the stories that have been so widely published, the\r\nEdisons, while not rich by any means, were in comfortable circumstances,\r\nwith a well-stocked farm and large orchard to draw upon also for\r\nsustenance. Samuel Edison, on moving to Port Huron, became a dealer in\r\ngrain and feed, and gave attention to that business for many years. But\r\nhe was also active in the lumber industry in the Saginaw district and\r\nseveral other things. It was difficult for a man of such mercurial,\r\nrestless temperament to stay constant to any one occupation; in fact,\r\nhad he been less visionary he would have been more prosperous, but might\r\nnot have had a son so gifted with insight and imagination. One instance\r\nof the optimistic vagaries which led him incessantly to spend time and\r\nmoney on projects that would not have appealed to a man less sanguine\r\nwas the construction on his property of a wooden observation tower over\r\na hundred feet high, the top of which was reached toilsomely by winding\r\nstairs, after the payment of twenty-five cents. It is true that the\r\ntower commanded a pretty view by land and water, but Colonel Sellers\r\nhimself might have projected this enterprise as a possible source of\r\nsteady income. At first few visitors panted up the long flights of steps\r\nto the breezy platform. During the first two months Edison's father\r\ntook in three dollars, and felt extremely blue over the prospect, and\r\nto young Edison and his relatives were left the lonely pleasures of the\r\nlookout and the enjoyment of the telescope with which it was equipped.\r\nBut one fine day there came an excursion from an inland town to see the\r\nlake. They picnicked in the grove, and six hundred of them went up\r\nthe tower. After that the railroad company began to advertise these\r\nexcursions, and the receipts each year paid for the observatory.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that, immersed in business and preoccupied with\r\nschemes of this character, Mr. Edison was to blame for the neglect of\r\nhis son's education. But that was not the case. The conditions were\r\npeculiar. It was at the Port Huron public school that Edison received\r\nall the regular scholastic instruction he ever enjoyed--just three\r\nmonths. He might have spent the full term there, but, as already noted,\r\nhis teacher had found him \"addled.\" He was always, according to his own\r\nrecollection, at the foot of the class, and had come almost to regard\r\nhimself as a dunce, while his father entertained vague anxieties as to\r\nhis stupidity. The truth of the matter seems to be that Mrs. Edison, a\r\nteacher of uncommon ability and force, held no very high opinion of\r\nthe average public-school methods and results, and was both eager to\r\nundertake the instruction of her son and ambitious for the future of\r\na boy whom she knew from pedagogic experience to be receptive and\r\nthoughtful to a very unusual degree. With her he found study easy and\r\npleasant. The quality of culture in that simple but refined home, as\r\nwell as the intellectual character of this youth without schooling, may\r\nbe inferred from the fact that before he had reached the age of twelve\r\nhe had read, with his mother's help, Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the\r\nRoman Empire, Hume's History of England, Sears' History of the World,\r\nBurton's Anatomy of Melancholy, and the Dictionary of Sciences; and had\r\neven attempted to struggle through Newton's Principia, whose mathematics\r\nwere decidedly beyond both teacher and student. Besides, Edison, like\r\nFaraday, was never a mathematician, and has had little personal use\r\nfor arithmetic beyond that which is called \"mental.\" He said once to a\r\nfriend: \"I can always hire some mathematicians, but they can't hire me.\"\r\nHis father, by-the-way, always encouraged these literary tastes, and\r\npaid him a small sum for each new book mastered. It will be noted that\r\nfiction makes no showing in the list; but it was not altogether\r\nexcluded from the home library, and Edison has all his life enjoyed\r\nit, particularly the works of such writers as Victor Hugo, after whom,\r\nbecause of his enthusiastic admiration--possibly also because of his\r\nimagination--he was nicknamed by his fellow-operators, \"Victor Hugo\r\nEdison.\"\r\n\r\nElectricity at that moment could have no allure for a youthful mind.\r\nCrude telegraphy represented what was known of it practically, and about\r\nthat the books read by young Edison were not redundantly informational.\r\nEven had that not been so, the inclinations of the boy barely ten years\r\nold were toward chemistry, and fifty years later there is seen no change\r\nof predilection. It sounds like heresy to say that Edison became an\r\nelectrician by chance, but it is the sober fact that to this pre-eminent\r\nand brilliant leader in electrical achievement escape into the chemical\r\ndomain still has the aspect of a delightful truant holiday. One of\r\nthe earliest stories about his boyhood relates to the incident when\r\nhe induced a lad employed in the family to swallow a large quantity of\r\nSeidlitz powders in the belief that the gases generated would enable\r\nhim to fly. The agonies of the victim attracted attention, and Edison's\r\nmother marked her displeasure by an application of the switch kept\r\nbehind the old Seth Thomas \"grandfather clock.\" The disastrous result\r\nof this experiment did not discourage Edison at all, as he attributed\r\nfailure to the lad rather than to the motive power. In the cellar of\r\nthe Edison homestead young Alva soon accumulated a chemical outfit,\r\nconstituting the first in a long series of laboratories. The word\r\n\"laboratory\" had always been associated with alchemists in the past,\r\nbut as with \"filament\" this untutored stripling applied an iconoclastic\r\npracticability to it long before he realized the significance of the\r\nnew departure. Goethe, in his legend of Faust, shows the traditional\r\nor conventional philosopher in his laboratory, an aged, tottering,\r\ngray-bearded investigator, who only becomes youthful upon diabolical\r\nintervention, and would stay senile without it. In the Edison laboratory\r\nno such weird transformation has been necessary, for the philosopher\r\nhad youth, fiery energy, and a grimly practical determination that would\r\nsubmit to no denial of the goal of something of real benefit to mankind.\r\nEdison and Faust are indeed the extremes of philosophic thought and\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe home at Port Huron thus saw the first Edison laboratory. The boy\r\nbegan experimenting when he was about ten or eleven years of age. He got\r\na copy of Parker's School Philosophy, an elementary book on physics, and\r\nabout every experiment in it he tried. Young Alva, or \"Al,\" as he was\r\ncalled, thus early displayed his great passion for chemistry, and in\r\nthe cellar of the house he collected no fewer than two hundred bottles,\r\ngleaned in baskets from all parts of the town. These were arranged\r\ncarefully on shelves and all labelled \"Poison,\" so that no one else\r\nwould handle or disturb them. They contained the chemicals with which\r\nhe was constantly experimenting. To others this diversion was both\r\nmysterious and meaningless, but he had soon become familiar with all\r\nthe chemicals obtainable at the local drug stores, and had tested to\r\nhis satisfaction many of the statements encountered in his scientific\r\nreading. Edison has said that sometimes he has wondered how it was\r\nhe did not become an analytical chemist instead of concentrating on\r\nelectricity, for which he had at first no great inclination.\r\n\r\nDeprived of the use of a large part of her cellar, tiring of the \"mess\"\r\nalways to be found there, and somewhat fearful of results, his mother\r\nonce told the boy to clear everything out and restore order. The thought\r\nof losing all his possessions was the cause of so much ardent distress\r\nthat his mother relented, but insisted that he must get a lock and key,\r\nand keep the embryonic laboratory closed up all the time except when he\r\nwas there. This was done. From such work came an early familiarity with\r\nthe nature of electrical batteries and the production of current from\r\nthem. Apparently the greater part of his spare time was spent in the\r\ncellar, for he did not share to any extent in the sports of the boys of\r\nthe neighborhood, his chum and chief companion, Michael Oates, being a\r\nlad of Dutch origin, many years older, who did chores around the\r\nhouse, and who could be recruited as a general utility Friday for the\r\nexperiments of this young explorer--such as that with the Seidlitz\r\npowders.\r\n\r\nSuch pursuits as these consumed the scant pocket-money of the boy very\r\nrapidly. He was not in regular attendance at school, and had read all\r\nthe books within reach. It was thus he turned newsboy, overcoming the\r\nreluctance of his parents, particularly that of his mother, by pointing\r\nout that he could by this means earn all he wanted for his experiments\r\nand get fresh reading in the shape of papers and magazines free of\r\ncharge. Besides, his leisure hours in Detroit he would be able to spend\r\nat the public library. He applied (in 1859) for the privilege of selling\r\nnewspapers on the trains of the Grand Trunk Railroad, between Port Huron\r\nand Detroit, and obtained the concession after a short delay, during\r\nwhich he made an essay in his task of selling newspapers.\r\n\r\nEdison had, as a fact, already had some commercial experience from the\r\nage of eleven. The ten acres of the reservation offered an excellent\r\nopportunity for truck-farming, and the versatile head of the family\r\ncould not avoid trying his luck in this branch of work. A large \"market\r\ngarden\" was laid out, in which Edison worked pretty steadily with the\r\nhelp of the Dutch boy, Michael Oates--he of the flying experiment. These\r\nboys had a horse and small wagon intrusted to them, and every morning in\r\nthe season they would load up with onions, lettuce, peas, etc., and go\r\nthrough the town.\r\n\r\nAs much as $600 was turned over to Mrs. Edison in one year from this\r\nsource. The boy was indefatigable but not altogether charmed with\r\nagriculture. \"After a while I tired of this work, as hoeing corn in\r\na hot sun is unattractive, and I did not wonder that it had built up\r\ncities. Soon the Grand Trunk Railroad was extended from Toronto to Port\r\nHuron, at the foot of Lake Huron, and thence to Detroit, at about the\r\nsame time the War of the Rebellion broke out. By a great amount of\r\npersistence I got permission from my mother to go on the local train\r\nas a newsboy. The local train from Port Huron to Detroit, a distance of\r\nsixty-three miles, left at 7 A.M. and arrived again at 9.30 P.M. After\r\nbeing on the train for several months, I started two stores in Port\r\nHuron--one for periodicals, and the other for vegetables, butter, and\r\nberries in the season. These were attended by two boys who shared in the\r\nprofits. The periodical store I soon closed, as the boy in charge could\r\nnot be trusted. The vegetable store I kept up for nearly a year. After\r\nthe railroad had been opened a short time, they put on an express which\r\nleft Detroit in the morning and returned in the evening. I received\r\npermission to put a newsboy on this train. Connected with this train was\r\na car, one part for baggage and the other part for U. S. mail, but for\r\na long time it was not used. Every morning I had two large baskets of\r\nvegetables from the Detroit market loaded in the mail-car and sent to\r\nPort Huron, where the boy would take them to the store. They were much\r\nbetter than those grown locally, and sold readily. I never was asked to\r\npay freight, and to this day cannot explain why, except that I was so\r\nsmall and industrious, and the nerve to appropriate a U. S. mail-car to\r\ndo a free freight business was so monumental. However, I kept this up\r\nfor a long time, and in addition bought butter from the farmers along\r\nthe line, and an immense amount of blackberries in the season. I bought\r\nwholesale and at a low price, and permitted the wives of the engineers\r\nand trainmen to have the benefit of the discount. After a while there\r\nwas a daily immigrant train put on. This train generally had from seven\r\nto ten coaches filled always with Norwegians, all bound for Iowa and\r\nMinnesota. On these trains I employed a boy who sold bread, tobacco, and\r\nstick candy. As the war progressed the daily newspaper sales became very\r\nprofitable, and I gave up the vegetable store.\"\r\n\r\nThe hours of this occupation were long, but the work was not\r\nparticularly heavy, and Edison soon found opportunity for his favorite\r\navocation--chemical experimentation. His train left Port Huron at 7\r\nA.M., and made its southward trip to Detroit in about three hours. This\r\ngave a stay in that city from 10 A.M. until the late afternoon, when the\r\ntrain left, arriving at Port Huron about 9.30 P.M. The train was made up\r\nof three coaches--baggage, smoking, and ordinary passenger or \"ladies.\"\r\nThe baggage-car was divided into three compartments--one for trunks and\r\npackages, one for the mail, and one for smoking. In those days no use\r\nwas made of the smoking-compartment, as there was no ventilation, and it\r\nwas turned over to young Edison, who not only kept papers there and his\r\nstock of goods as a \"candy butcher,\" but soon had it equipped with an\r\nextraordinary variety of apparatus. There was plenty of leisure on the\r\ntwo daily runs, even for an industrious boy, and thus he found time\r\nto transfer his laboratory from the cellar and re-establish it on the\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nHis earnings were also excellent--so good, in fact, that eight or ten\r\ndollars a day were often taken in, and one dollar went every day to his\r\nmother. Thus supporting himself, he felt entitled to spend any other\r\nprofit left over on chemicals and apparatus. And spent it was, for with\r\naccess to Detroit and its large stores, where he bought his supplies,\r\nand to the public library, where he could quench his thirst for\r\ntechnical information, Edison gave up all his spare time and money to\r\nchemistry. Surely the country could have presented at that moment no\r\nmore striking example of the passionate pursuit of knowledge under\r\ndifficulties than this newsboy, barely fourteen years of age, with his\r\njars and test-tubes installed on a railway baggage-car.\r\n\r\nNor did this amazing equipment stop at batteries and bottles. The same\r\nlittle space a few feet square was soon converted by this precocious\r\nyouth into a newspaper office. The outbreak of the Civil War gave a\r\ngreat stimulus to the demand for all newspapers, noticing which he\r\nbecame ambitious to publish a local journal of his own, devoted to the\r\nnews of that section of the Grand Trunk road. A small printing-press\r\nthat had been used for hotel bills of fare was picked up in Detroit,\r\nand type was also bought, some of it being placed on the train so that\r\ncomposition could go on in spells of leisure. To one so mechanical in\r\nhis tastes as Edison, it was quite easy to learn the rudiments of the\r\nprinting art, and thus the Weekly Herald came into existence, of which\r\nhe was compositor, pressman, editor, publisher, and newsdealer. Only one\r\nor two copies of this journal are now discoverable, but its appearance\r\ncan be judged from the reduced facsimile here shown. The thing was\r\nindeed well done as the work of a youth shown by the date to be less\r\nthan fifteen years old. The literary style is good, there are only a few\r\ntrivial slips in spelling, and the appreciation is keen of what would be\r\ninteresting news and gossip. The price was three cents a copy, or eight\r\ncents a month for regular subscribers, and the circulation ran up to\r\nover four hundred copies an issue. This was by no means the result of\r\nmere public curiosity, but attested the value of the sheet as a genuine\r\nnewspaper, to which many persons in the railroad service along the\r\nline were willing contributors. Indeed, with the aid of the railway\r\ntelegraph, Edison was often able to print late news of importance, of\r\nlocal origin, that the distant regular papers like those of Detroit,\r\nwhich he handled as a newsboy, could not get. It is no wonder that this\r\nclever little sheet received the approval and patronage of the English\r\nengineer Stephenson when inspecting the Grand Trunk system, and was\r\nnoted by no less distinguished a contemporary than the London Times as\r\nthe first newspaper in the world to be printed on a train in motion.\r\nThe youthful proprietor sometimes cleared as much as twenty to thirty\r\ndollars a month from this unique journalistic enterprise.\r\n\r\nBut all this extra work required attention, and Edison solved the\r\ndifficulty of attending also to the newsboy business by the employment\r\nof a young friend, whom he trained and treated liberally as an\r\nunderstudy. There was often plenty of work for both in the early days\r\nof the war, when the news of battle caused intense excitement and large\r\nsales of papers. Edison, with native shrewdness already so strikingly\r\ndisplayed, would telegraph the station agents and get them to bulletin\r\nthe event of the day at the front, so that when each station was reached\r\nthere were eager purchasers waiting. He recalls in particular the\r\nsensation caused by the great battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing,\r\nin April, 1862, in which both Grant and Sherman were engaged, in which\r\nJohnston died, and in which there was a ghastly total of 25,000 killed\r\nand wounded.\r\n\r\nIn describing his enterprising action that day, Edison says that when\r\nhe reached Detroit the bulletin-boards of the newspaper offices were\r\nsurrounded with dense crowds, which read awestricken the news that there\r\nwere 60,000 killed and wounded, and that the result was uncertain. \"I\r\nknew that if the same excitement was attained at the various small towns\r\nalong the road, and especially at Port Huron, the sale of papers would\r\nbe great. I then conceived the idea of telegraphing the news ahead, went\r\nto the operator in the depot, and by giving him Harper's Weekly and\r\nsome other papers for three months, he agreed to telegraph to all the\r\nstations the matter on the bulletin-board. I hurriedly copied it, and he\r\nsent it, requesting the agents to display it on the blackboards used for\r\nstating the arrival and departure of trains. I decided that instead of\r\nthe usual one hundred papers I could sell one thousand; but not having\r\nsufficient money to purchase that number, I determined in my desperation\r\nto see the editor himself and get credit. The great paper at that time\r\nwas the Detroit Free Press. I walked into the office marked 'Editorial'\r\nand told a young man that I wanted to see the editor on important\r\nbusiness--important to me, anyway, I was taken into an office where\r\nthere were two men, and I stated what I had done about telegraphing, and\r\nthat I wanted a thousand papers, but only had money for three hundred,\r\nand I wanted credit. One of the men refused it, but the other told the\r\nfirst spokesman to let me have them. This man, I afterward learned, was\r\nWilbur F. Storey, who subsequently founded the Chicago Times, and became\r\ncelebrated in the newspaper world. By the aid of another boy I lugged\r\nthe papers to the train and started folding them. The first station,\r\ncalled Utica, was a small one where I generally sold two papers. I saw\r\na crowd ahead on the platform, and thought it some excursion, but\r\nthe moment I landed there was a rush for me; then I realized that the\r\ntelegraph was a great invention. I sold thirty-five papers there. The\r\nnext station was Mount Clemens, now a watering-place, but then a town of\r\nabout one thousand. I usually sold six to eight papers there. I decided\r\nthat if I found a corresponding crowd there, the only thing to do to\r\ncorrect my lack of judgment in not getting more papers was to raise\r\nthe price from five cents to ten. The crowd was there, and I raised the\r\nprice. At the various towns there were corresponding crowds. It had\r\nbeen my practice at Port Huron to jump from the train at a point\r\nabout one-fourth of a mile from the station, where the train generally\r\nslackened speed. I had drawn several loads of sand to this point to jump\r\non, and had become quite expert. The little Dutch boy with the horse met\r\nme at this point. When the wagon approached the outskirts of the town\r\nI was met by a large crowd. I then yelled: 'Twenty-five cents apiece,\r\ngentlemen! I haven't enough to go around!' I sold all out, and made what\r\nto me then was an immense sum of money.\"\r\n\r\nSuch episodes as this added materially to his income, but did not\r\nnecessarily increase his savings, for he was then, as now, an utter\r\nspendthrift so long as some new apparatus or supplies for experiment\r\ncould be had. In fact, the laboratory on wheels soon became crowded\r\nwith such equipment, most costly chemicals were bought on the instalment\r\nplan, and Fresenius' Qualitative Analysis served as a basis for\r\nceaseless testing and study. George Pullman, who then had a small shop\r\nat Detroit and was working on his sleeping-car, made Edison a lot of\r\nwooden apparatus for his chemicals, to the boy's delight. Unfortunately\r\na sudden change came, fraught with disaster. The train, running one day\r\nat thirty miles an hour over a piece of poorly laid track, was thrown\r\nsuddenly out of the perpendicular with a violent lurch, and, before\r\nEdison could catch it, a stick of phosphorus was jarred from its shelf,\r\nfell to the floor, and burst into flame. The car took fire, and the boy,\r\nin dismay, was still trying to quench the blaze when the conductor, a\r\nquick-tempered Scotchman, who acted also as baggage-master, hastened to\r\nthe scene with water and saved his car. On the arrival at Mount Clemens\r\nstation, its next stop, Edison and his entire outfit, laboratory,\r\nprinting-plant, and all, were promptly ejected by the enraged conductor,\r\nand the train then moved off, leaving him on the platform, tearful and\r\nindignant in the midst of his beloved but ruined possessions. It was\r\nlynch law of a kind; but in view of the responsibility, this action of\r\nthe conductor lay well within his rights and duties.\r\n\r\nIt was through this incident that Edison acquired the deafness that\r\nhas persisted all through his life, a severe box on the ears from the\r\nscorched and angry conductor being the direct cause of the infirmity.\r\nAlthough this deafness would be regarded as a great affliction by most\r\npeople, and has brought in its train other serious baubles, Mr. Edison\r\nhas always regarded it philosophically, and said about it recently:\r\n\"This deafness has been of great advantage to me in various ways. When\r\nin a telegraph office, I could only hear the instrument directly on the\r\ntable at which I sat, and unlike the other operators, I was not bothered\r\nby the other instruments. Again, in experimenting on the telephone,\r\nI had to improve the transmitter so I could hear it. This made the\r\ntelephone commercial, as the magneto telephone receiver of Bell was too\r\nweak to be used as a transmitter commercially. It was the same with the\r\nphonograph. The great defect of that instrument was the rendering of the\r\novertones in music, and the hissing consonants in speech. I worked over\r\none year, twenty hours a day, Sundays and all, to get the word 'specie'\r\nperfectly recorded and reproduced on the phonograph. When this was done\r\nI knew that everything else could be done which was a fact. Again,\r\nmy nerves have been preserved intact. Broadway is as quiet to me as a\r\ncountry village is to a person with normal hearing.\"\r\n\r\nSaddened but not wholly discouraged, Edison soon reconstituted his\r\nlaboratory and printing-office at home, although on the part of the\r\nfamily there was some fear and objection after this episode, on the\r\nscore of fire. But Edison promised not to bring in anything of a\r\ndangerous nature. He did not cease the publication of the Weekly Herald.\r\nOn the contrary, he prospered in both his enterprises until persuaded\r\nby the \"printer's devil\" in the office of the Port Huron Commercial to\r\nchange the character of his journal, enlarge it, and issue it under the\r\nname of Paul Pry, a happy designation for this or kindred ventures\r\nin the domain of society journalism. No copies of Paul Pry can now be\r\nfound, but it is known that its style was distinctly personal, that\r\ngossip was its specialty, and that no small offence was given to the\r\npeople whose peculiarities or peccadilloes were discussed in a frank\r\nand breezy style by the two boys. In one instance the resentment of the\r\nvictim of such unsought publicity was so intense he laid hands on Edison\r\nand pitched the startled young editor into the St. Clair River. The name\r\nof this violator of the freedom of the press was thereafter excluded\r\nstudiously from the columns of Paul Pry, and the incident may have been\r\none of those which soon caused the abandonment of the paper. Edison\r\nhad great zest in this work, and but for the strong influences in other\r\ndirections would probably have continued in the newspaper field, in\r\nwhich he was, beyond question, the youngest publisher and editor of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this period of his career, it is to be noted that it gave\r\nEdison many favorable opportunities. In Detroit he could spend frequent\r\nhours in the public library, and it is matter of record that he began\r\nhis liberal acquaintance with its contents by grappling bravely with a\r\ncertain section and trying to read it through consecutively, shelf by\r\nshelf, regardless of subject. In a way this is curiously suggestive\r\nof the earnest, energetic method of \"frontal attack\" with which the\r\ninventor has since addressed himself to so many problems in the arts and\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk Railroad machine-shops at Port Huron were a great\r\nattraction to the boy, who appears to have spent a good deal of his time\r\nthere. He who was to have much to do with the evolution of the modern\r\nelectric locomotive was fascinated by the mechanism of the steam\r\nlocomotive; and whenever he could get the chance Edison rode in the cab\r\nwith the engineer of his train. He became thoroughly familiar with the\r\nintricacies of fire-box, boiler, valves, levers, and gears, and liked\r\nnothing better than to handle the locomotive himself during the run.\r\nOn one trip, when the engineer lay asleep while his eager substitute\r\npiloted the train, the boiler \"primed,\" and a deluge overwhelmed the\r\nyoung driver, who stuck to his post till the run and the ordeal were\r\nended. Possibly this helped to spoil a locomotive engineer, but went\r\nto make a great master of the new motive power. \"Steam is half an\r\nEnglishman,\" said Emerson. The temptation is strong to say that workaday\r\nelectricity is half an American. Edison's own account of the incident\r\nis very laughable: \"The engine was one of a number leased to the Grand\r\nTrunk by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. It had bright brass bands all\r\nover, the woodwork beautifully painted, and everything highly polished,\r\nwhich was the custom up to the time old Commodore Vanderbilt stopped\r\nit on his roads. After running about fifteen miles the fireman couldn't\r\nkeep his eyes open (this event followed an all-night dance of the\r\ntrainmen's fraternal organization), and he agreed to permit me to run\r\nthe engine. I took charge, reducing the speed to about twelve miles\r\nan hour, and brought the train of seven cars to her destination at the\r\nGrand Trunk junction safely. But something occurred which was very much\r\nout of the ordinary. I was very much worried about the water, and I\r\nknew that if it got low the boiler was likely to explode. I hadn't gone\r\ntwenty miles before black damp mud blew out of the stack and covered\r\nevery part of the engine, including myself. I was about to awaken the\r\nfireman to find out the cause of this when it stopped. Then I approached\r\na station where the fireman always went out to the cowcatcher, opened\r\nthe oil-cup on the steam-chest, and poured oil in. I started to carry\r\nout the procedure when, upon opening the oil-cup, the steam rushed out\r\nwith a tremendous noise, nearly knocking me off the engine. I succeeded\r\nin closing the oil-cup and got back in the cab, and made up my mind\r\nthat she would pull through without oil. I learned afterward that the\r\nengineer always shut off steam when the fireman went out to oil. This\r\npoint I failed to notice. My powers of observation were very much\r\nimproved after this occurrence. Just before I reached the junction\r\nanother outpour of black mud occurred, and the whole engine was a\r\nsight--so much so that when I pulled into the yard everybody turned to\r\nsee it, laughing immoderately. I found the reason of the mud was that I\r\ncarried so much water it passed over into the stack, and this washed out\r\nall the accumulated soot.\"\r\n\r\nOne afternoon about a week before Christmas Edison's train jumped the\r\ntrack near Utica, a station on the line. Four old Michigan Central\r\ncars with rotten sills collapsed in the ditch and went all to pieces,\r\ndistributing figs, raisins, dates, and candies all over the track and\r\nthe vicinity. Hating to see so much waste, Edison tried to save all he\r\ncould by eating it on the spot, but as a result \"our family doctor had\r\nthe time of his life with me in this connection.\"\r\n\r\nAn absurd incident described by Edison throws a vivid light on the\r\nfree-and-easy condition of early railroad travel and on the Southern\r\nextravagance of the time. \"In 1860, just before the war broke out there\r\ncame to the train one afternoon, in Detroit, two fine-looking young men\r\naccompanied by a colored servant. They bought tickets for Port Huron,\r\nthe terminal point for the train. After leaving the junction just\r\noutside of Detroit, I brought in the evening papers. When I came\r\nopposite the two young men, one of them said: 'Boy, what have you got?'\r\nI said: 'Papers.' 'All right.' He took them and threw them out of the\r\nwindow, and, turning to the colored man, said: 'Nicodemus, pay this\r\nboy.' I told Nicodemus the amount, and he opened a satchel and paid me.\r\nThe passengers didn't know what to make of the transaction. I returned\r\nwith the illustrated papers and magazines. These were seized and thrown\r\nout of the window, and I was told to get my money of Nicodemus. I then\r\nreturned with all the old magazines and novels I had not been able to\r\nsell, thinking perhaps this would be too much for them. I was small and\r\nthin, and the layer reached above my head, and was all I could possibly\r\ncarry. I had prepared a list, and knew the amount in case they bit\r\nagain. When I opened the door, all the passengers roared with laughter.\r\nI walked right up to the young men. One asked me what I had. I said\r\n'Magazines and novels.' He promptly threw them out of the window,\r\nand Nicodemus settled. Then I came in with cracked hickory nuts, then\r\npop-corn balls, and, finally, molasses candy. All went out of the\r\nwindow. I felt like Alexander the Great!--I had no more chance! I had\r\nsold all I had. Finally I put a rope to my trunk, which was about\r\nthe size of a carpenter's chest, and started to pull this from the\r\nbaggage-car to the passenger-car. It was almost too much for my\r\nstrength, but at last I got it in front of those men. I pulled off my\r\ncoat, shoes, and hat, and laid them on the chest. Then he asked: 'What\r\nhave you got, boy?' I said: 'Everything, sir, that I can spare that is\r\nfor sale.' The passengers fairly jumped with laughter. Nicodemus paid me\r\n$27 for this last sale, and threw the whole out of the door in the rear\r\nof the car. These men were from the South, and I have always retained a\r\nsoft spot in my heart for a Southern gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Edison was a newsboy on the train a request came to him one day\r\nto go to the office of E. B. Ward & Company, at that time the largest\r\nowners of steamboats on the Great Lakes. The captain of their largest\r\nboat had died suddenly, and they wanted a message taken to another\r\ncaptain who lived about fourteen miles from Ridgeway station on the\r\nrailroad. This captain had retired, taken up some lumber land, and had\r\ncleared part of it. Edison was offered $15 by Mr. Ward to go and fetch\r\nhim, but as it was a wild country and would be dark, Edison stood out\r\nfor $25, so that he could get the companionship of another lad. The\r\nterms were agreed to. Edison arrived at Ridgeway at 8.30 P.M., when it\r\nwas raining and as dark as ink. Getting another boy with difficulty to\r\nvolunteer, he launched out on his errand in the pitch-black night. The\r\ntwo boys carried lanterns, but the road was a rough path through dense\r\nforest. The country was wild, and it was a usual occurrence to see deer,\r\nbear, and coon skins nailed up on the sides of houses to dry. Edison had\r\nread about bears, but couldn't remember whether they were day or night\r\nprowlers. The farther they went the more apprehensive they became, and\r\nevery stump in the ravished forest looked like a bear. The other lad\r\nproposed seeking safety up a tree, but Edison demurred on the plea that\r\nbears could climb, and that the message must be delivered that night to\r\nenable the captain to catch the morning train. First one lantern went\r\nout, then the other. \"We leaned up against a tree and cried. I thought\r\nif I ever got out of that scrape alive I would know more about the\r\nhabits of animals and everything else, and be prepared for all kinds of\r\nmischance when I undertook an enterprise. However, the intense darkness\r\ndilated the pupils of our eyes so as to make them very sensitive, and\r\nwe could just see at times the outlines of the road. Finally, just as\r\na faint gleam of daylight arrived, we entered the captain's yard and\r\ndelivered the message. In my whole life I never spent such a night of\r\nhorror as this, but I got a good lesson.\"\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident of this period is told by Edison. \"When I was a\r\nboy,\" he says, \"the Prince of Wales, the late King Edward, came to\r\nCanada (1860). Great preparations were made at Sarnia, the Canadian town\r\nopposite Port Huron. About every boy, including myself, went over to\r\nsee the affair. The town was draped in flags most profusely, and carpets\r\nwere laid on the cross-walks for the prince to walk on. There were\r\narches, etc. A stand was built raised above the general level, where the\r\nprince was to be received by the mayor. Seeing all these preparations,\r\nmy idea of a prince was very high; but when he did arrive I mistook the\r\nDuke of Newcastle for him, the duke being a fine-looking man. I soon saw\r\nthat I was mistaken: that the prince was a young stripling, and did\r\nnot meet expectations. Several of us expressed our belief that a prince\r\nwasn't much, after all, and said that we were thoroughly disappointed.\r\nFor this one boy was whipped. Soon the Canuck boys attacked the Yankee\r\nboys, and we were all badly licked. I, myself, got a black eye. That has\r\nalways prejudiced me against that kind of ceremonial and folly.\" It is\r\ncertainly interesting to note that in later years the prince for whom\r\nEdison endured the ignominy of a black eye made generous compensation\r\nin a graceful letter accompanying the gold Albert Medal awarded by the\r\nRoyal Society of Arts.\r\n\r\nAnother incident of the period is as follows: \"After selling papers in\r\nPort Huron, which was often not reached until about 9.30 at night, I\r\nseldom got home before 11.00 or 11.30. About half-way home from the\r\nstation and the town, and within twenty-five feet of the road in a\r\ndense wood, was a soldiers' graveyard where three hundred soldiers were\r\nburied, due to a cholera epidemic which took place at Fort Gratiot, near\r\nby, many years previously. At first we used to shut our eyes and run the\r\nhorse past this graveyard, and if the horse stepped on a twig my heart\r\nwould give a violent movement, and it is a wonder that I haven't some\r\nvalvular disease of that organ. But soon this running of the horse\r\nbecame monotonous, and after a while all fears of graveyards absolutely\r\ndisappeared from my system. I was in the condition of Sam Houston, the\r\npioneer and founder of Texas, who, it was said, knew no fear. Houston\r\nlived some distance from the town and generally went home late at night,\r\nhaving to pass through a dark cypress swamp over a corduroy road. One\r\nnight, to test his alleged fearlessness, a man stationed himself behind\r\na tree and enveloped himself in a sheet. He confronted Houston suddenly,\r\nand Sam stopped and said: 'If you are a man, you can't hurt me. If you\r\nare a ghost, you don't want to hurt me. And if you are the devil, come\r\nhome with me; I married your sister!'\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred, however, from some of the preceding statements\r\nthat the boy was of an exclusively studious bent of mind. He had then,\r\nas now, the keen enjoyment of a joke, and no particular aversion to the\r\npractical form. An incident of the time is in point. \"After the breaking\r\nout of the war there was a regiment of volunteer soldiers quartered\r\nat Fort Gratiot, the reservation extending to the boundary line of our\r\nhouse. Nearly every night we would hear a call, such as 'Corporal of\r\nthe Guard, No. 1.' This would be repeated from sentry to sentry until it\r\nreached the barracks, when Corporal of the Guard, No. 1, would come and\r\nsee what was wanted. I and the little Dutch boy, after returning from\r\nthe town after selling our papers, thought we would take a hand at\r\nmilitary affairs. So one night, when it was very dark, I shouted for\r\nCorporal of the Guard, No. 1. The second sentry, thinking it was the\r\nterminal sentry who shouted, repeated it to the third, and so on. This\r\nbrought the corporal along the half mile, only to find that he was\r\nfooled. We tried him three nights; but the third night they were\r\nwatching, and caught the little Dutch boy, took him to the lock-up at\r\nthe fort, and shut him up. They chased me to the house. I rushed for the\r\ncellar. In one small apartment there were two barrels of potatoes and a\r\nthird one nearly empty. I poured these remnants into the other barrels,\r\nsat down, and pulled the barrel over my head, bottom up. The soldiers\r\nhad awakened my father, and they were searching for me with candles and\r\nlanterns. The corporal was absolutely certain I came into the cellar,\r\nand couldn't see how I could have gotten out, and wanted to know from my\r\nfather if there was no secret hiding-place. On assurance of my father,\r\nwho said that there was not, he said it was most extraordinary. I was\r\nglad when they left, as I was cramped, and the potatoes were rotten that\r\nhad been in the barrel and violently offensive. The next morning I was\r\nfound in bed, and received a good switching on the legs from my father,\r\nthe first and only one I ever received from him, although my mother kept\r\na switch behind the old Seth Thomas clock that had the bark worn off.\r\nMy mother's ideas and mine differed at times, especially when I got\r\nexperimenting and mussed up things. The Dutch boy was released next\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG TELEGRAPH OPERATOR\r\n\r\n\"WHILE a newsboy on the railroad,\" says Edison, \"I got very much\r\ninterested in electricity, probably from visiting telegraph offices with\r\na chum who had tastes similar to mine.\" It will also have been noted\r\nthat he used the telegraph to get items for his little journal, and to\r\nbulletin his special news of the Civil War along the line. The next step\r\nwas natural, and having with his knowledge of chemistry no trouble about\r\n\"setting up\" his batteries, the difficulties of securing apparatus were\r\nchiefly those connected with the circuits and the instruments. American\r\nyouths to-day are given, if of a mechanical turn of mind, to amateur\r\ntelegraphy or telephony, but seldom, if ever, have to make any part of\r\nthe system constructed. In Edison's boyish days it was quite different,\r\nand telegraphic supplies were hard to obtain. But he and his \"chum\"\r\nhad a line between their homes, built of common stove-pipe wire. The\r\ninsulators were bottles set on nails driven into trees and short poles.\r\nThe magnet wire was wound with rags for insulation, and pieces of spring\r\nbrass were used for keys. With an idea of securing current cheaply,\r\nEdison applied the little that he knew about static electricity,\r\nand actually experimented with cats, which he treated vigorously as\r\nfrictional machines until the animals fled in dismay, and Edison had\r\nlearned his first great lesson in the relative value of sources of\r\nelectrical energy. The line was made to work, however, and additional to\r\nthe messages that the boys interchanged, Edison secured practice in an\r\ningenious manner. His father insisted on 11.30 as proper bedtime, which\r\nleft but a short interval after the long day on the train. But each\r\nevening, when the boy went home with a bundle of papers that had\r\nnot been sold in the town, his father would sit up reading the\r\n\"returnables.\" Edison, therefore, on some excuse, left the papers\r\nwith his friend, but suggested that he could get the news from him by\r\ntelegraph, bit by bit. The scheme interested his father, and was\r\nput into effect, the messages being written down and handed over for\r\nperusal. This yielded good practice nightly, lasting until 12 and\r\n1 o'clock, and was maintained for some time until Mr. Edison became\r\nwilling that his son should stay up for a reasonable time. The papers\r\nwere then brought home again, and the boys amused themselves to their\r\nhearts' content until the line was pulled down by a stray cow wandering\r\nthrough the orchard. Meantime better instruments had been secured, and\r\nthe rudiments of telegraphy had been fairly mastered.\r\n\r\nThe mixed train on which Edison was employed as newsboy did the\r\nway-freight work and shunting at the Mount Clemens station, about half\r\nan hour being usually spent in the work. One August morning, in 1862,\r\nwhile the shunting was in progress, and a laden box-car had been pushed\r\nout of a siding, Edison, who was loitering about the platform, saw the\r\nlittle son of the station agent, Mr. J. U. Mackenzie, playing with the\r\ngravel on the main track along which the car without a brakeman was\r\nrapidly approaching. Edison dropped his papers and his glazed cap,\r\nand made a dash for the child, whom he picked up and lifted to safety\r\nwithout a second to spare, as the wheel of the car struck his heel; and\r\nboth were cut about the face and hands by the gravel ballast on which\r\nthey fell. The two boys were picked up by the train-hands and carried\r\nto the platform, and the grateful father at once offered to teach the\r\nrescuer, whom he knew and liked, the art of train telegraphy and to make\r\nan operator of him. It is needless to say that the proposal was eagerly\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nEdison found time for his new studies by letting one of his friends look\r\nafter the newsboy work on the train for part of the trip, reserving\r\nto himself the run between Port Huron and Mount Clemens. That he was\r\nalready well qualified as a beginner is evident from the fact that he\r\nhad mastered the Morse code of the telegraphic alphabet, and was able\r\nto take to the station a neat little set of instruments he had just\r\nfinished with his own hands at a gun-shop in Detroit. This was probably\r\na unique achievement in itself among railway operators of that day or of\r\nlater times. The drill of the student involved chiefly the acquisition\r\nof the special signals employed in railway work, including the numerals\r\nand abbreviations applied to save time. Some of these have passed\r\ninto the slang of the day, \"73\" being well known as a telegrapher's\r\nexpression of compliments or good wishes, while \"23\" is an accident\r\nor death message, and has been given broader popular significance as\r\na general synonym for \"hoodoo.\" All of this came easily to Edison, who\r\nhad, moreover, as his Herald showed, an unusual familiarity with train\r\nmovement along that portion of the Grand Trunk road.\r\n\r\nThree or four months were spent pleasantly and profitably by the youth\r\nin this course of study, and Edison took to it enthusiastically, giving\r\nit no less than eighteen hours a day. He then put up a little telegraph\r\nline from the station to the village, a distance of about a mile, and\r\nopened an office in a drug store; but the business was naturally very\r\nsmall. The telegraph operator at Port Huron knowing of his proficiency,\r\nand wanting to get into the United States Military Telegraph Corps,\r\nwhere the pay in those days of the Civil War was high, succeeded in\r\nconvincing his brother-in-law, Mr. M. Walker, that young Edison could\r\nfill the position. Edison was, of course, well acquainted with the\r\noperators along the road and at the southern terminal, and took up his\r\nnew duties very easily. The office was located in a jewelry store, where\r\nnewspapers and periodicals were also sold. Edison was to be found at the\r\noffice both day and night, sleeping there. \"I became quite valuable to\r\nMr. Walker. After working all day I worked at the office nights as well,\r\nfor the reason that 'press report' came over one of the wires until 3\r\nA.M., and I would cut in and copy it as well as I could, to become more\r\nrapidly proficient. The goal of the rural telegraph operator was to be\r\nable to take press. Mr. Walker tried to get my father to apprentice me\r\nat $20 per month, but they could not agree. I then applied for a job on\r\nthe Grand Trunk Railroad as a railway operator, and was given a place,\r\nnights, at Stratford Junction, Canada.\" Apparently his friend Mackenzie\r\nhelped him in the matter. The position carried a salary of $25 per\r\nmonth. No serious objections were raised by his family, for the distance\r\nfrom Port Huron was not great, and Stratford was near Bayfield, the\r\nold home from which the Edisons had come, so that there were doubtless\r\nfriends or even relatives in the vicinity. This was in 1863.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker was an observant man, who has since that time installed a\r\nnumber of waterworks systems and obtained several patents of his own. He\r\ndescribes the boy of sixteen as engrossed intensely in his experiments\r\nand scientific reading, and somewhat indifferent, for this reason, to\r\nhis duties as operator. This office was not particularly busy, taking\r\nfrom $50 to $75 a month, but even the messages taken in would remain\r\nunsent on the hook while Edison was in the cellar below trying to solve\r\nsome chemical problem. The manager would see him studying sometimes\r\nan article in such a paper as the Scientific American, and then\r\ndisappearing to buy a few sundries for experiments. Returning from the\r\ndrug store with his chemicals, he would not be seen again until required\r\nby his duties, or until he had found out for himself, if possible, in\r\nthis offhand manner, whether what he had read was correct or not. When\r\nhe had completed his experiment all interest in it was lost, and the\r\njars and wires would be left to any fate that might befall them. In like\r\nmanner Edison would make free use of the watchmaker's tools that lay\r\non the little table in the front window, and would take the wire pliers\r\nthere without much thought as to their value as distinguished from a\r\nlineman's tools. The one idea was to do quickly what he wanted to do;\r\nand the same swift, almost headlong trial of anything that comes to\r\nhand, while the fervor of a new experiment is felt, has been noted\r\nat all stages of the inventor's career. One is reminded of Palissy's\r\nrecklessness, when in his efforts to make the enamel melt on his pottery\r\nhe used the very furniture of his home for firewood.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison remarks the fact that there was very little difference\r\nbetween the telegraph of that time and of to-day, except the general use\r\nof the old Morse register with the dots and dashes recorded by indenting\r\npaper strips that could be read and checked later at leisure if\r\nnecessary. He says: \"The telegraph men couldn't explain how it worked,\r\nand I was always trying to get them to do so. I think they couldn't. I\r\nremember the best explanation I got was from an old Scotch line repairer\r\nemployed by the Montreal Telegraph Company, which operated the railroad\r\nwires. He said that if you had a dog like a dachshund, long enough to\r\nreach from Edinburgh to London, if you pulled his tail in Edinburgh he\r\nwould bark in London. I could understand that, but I never could get\r\nit through me what went through the dog or over the wire.\" To-day\r\nMr. Edison is just as unable to solve the inner mystery of electrical\r\ntransmission. Nor is he alone. At the banquet given to celebrate his\r\njubilee in 1896 as professor at Glasgow University, Lord Kelvin, the\r\ngreatest physicist of our time, admitted with tears in his eyes and the\r\nnote of tragedy in his voice, that when it came to explaining the\r\nnature of electricity, he knew just as little as when he had begun as\r\na student, and felt almost as though his life had been wasted while he\r\ntried to grapple with the great mystery of physics.\r\n\r\nAnother episode of this period is curious in its revelation of the\r\ntenacity with which Edison has always held to some of his oldest\r\npossessions with a sense of personal attachment. \"While working\r\nat Stratford Junction,\" he says, \"I was told by one of the freight\r\nconductors that in the freight-house at Goodrich there were several\r\nboxes of old broken-up batteries. I went there and found over eighty\r\ncells of the well-known Grove nitric-acid battery. The operator there,\r\nwho was also agent, when asked by me if I could have the electrodes of\r\neach cell, made of sheet platinum, gave his permission readily, thinking\r\nthey were of tin. I removed them all, amounting to several ounces.\r\nPlatinum even in those days was very expensive, costing several dollars\r\nan ounce, and I owned only three small strips. I was overjoyed at this\r\nacquisition, and those very strips and the reworked scrap are used to\r\nthis day in my laboratory over forty years later.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at Stratford that Edison's inventiveness was first displayed. The\r\nhours of work of a night operator are usually from 7 P.M. to 7 A.M., and\r\nto insure attention while on duty it is often provided that the operator\r\nevery hour, from 9 P.M. until relieved by the day operator, shall send\r\nin the signal \"6\" to the train dispatcher's office. Edison revelled in\r\nthe opportunity for study and experiment given him by his long hours\r\nof freedom in the daytime, but needed sleep, just as any healthy youth\r\ndoes. Confronted by the necessity of sending in this watchman's signal\r\nas evidence that he was awake and on duty, he constructed a small wheel\r\nwith notches on the rim, and attached it to the clock in such a manner\r\nthat the night-watchman could start it when the line was quiet, and at\r\neach hour the wheel revolved and sent in accurately the dots required\r\nfor \"sixing.\" The invention was a success, the device being, indeed,\r\nsimilar to that of the modern district messenger box; but it was soon\r\nnoticed that, in spite of the regularity of the report, \"Sf\" could not\r\nbe raised even if a train message were sent immediately after. Detection\r\nand a reprimand came in due course, but were not taken very seriously.\r\n\r\nA serious occurrence that might have resulted in accident drove him soon\r\nafter from Canada, although the youth could hardly be held to blame for\r\nit. Edison says: \"This night job just suited me, as I could have the\r\nwhole day to myself. I had the faculty of sleeping in a chair any time\r\nfor a few minutes at a time. I taught the night-yardman my call, so I\r\ncould get half an hour's sleep now and then between trains, and in case\r\nthe station was called the watchman would awaken me. One night I got an\r\norder to hold a freight train, and I replied that I would. I rushed out\r\nto find the signalman, but before I could find him and get the signal\r\nset, the train ran past. I ran to the telegraph office, and reported\r\nthat I could not hold her. The reply was: 'Hell!' The train dispatcher,\r\non the strength of my message that I would hold the train, had permitted\r\nanother to leave the last station in the opposite direction. There was a\r\nlower station near the junction where the day operator slept. I started\r\nfor it on foot. The night was dark, and I fell into a culvert and was\r\nknocked senseless.\" Owing to the vigilance of the two engineers on\r\nthe locomotives, who saw each other approaching on the straight single\r\ntrack, nothing more dreadful happened than a summons to the thoughtless\r\noperator to appear before the general manager at Toronto. On reaching\r\nthe manager's office, his trial for neglect of duty was fortunately\r\ninterrupted by the call of two Englishmen; and while their conversation\r\nproceeded, Edison slipped quietly out of the room, hurried to the Grand\r\nTrunk freight depot, found a conductor he knew taking out a freight\r\ntrain for Sarnia, and was not happy until the ferry-boat from Sarnia had\r\nlanded him once more on the Michigan shore. The Grand Trunk still owes\r\nMr. Edison the wages due him at the time he thus withdrew from its\r\nservice, but the claim has never been pressed.\r\n\r\nThe same winter of 1863-64, while at Port Huron, Edison had a further\r\nopportunity of displaying his ingenuity. An ice-jam had broken the light\r\ntelegraph cable laid in the bed of the river across to Sarnia, and thus\r\ncommunication was interrupted. The river is three-quarters of a mile\r\nwide, and could not be crossed on foot; nor could the cable be repaired.\r\nEdison at once suggested using the steam whistle of the locomotive,\r\nand by manipulating the valve conversed the short and long outbursts of\r\nshrill sound into the Morse code. An operator on the Sarnia shore was\r\nquick enough to catch the significance of the strange whistling, and\r\nmessages were thus sent in wireless fashion across the ice-floes in the\r\nriver. It is said that such signals were also interchanged by military\r\ntelegraphers during the war, and possibly Edison may have heard of\r\nthe practice; but be that as it may, he certainly showed ingenuity\r\nand resource in applying such a method to meet the necessity. It is\r\ninteresting to note that at this point the Grand Trunk now has its St.\r\nClair tunnel, through which the trains are hauled under the river-bed by\r\nelectric locomotives.\r\n\r\nEdison had now begun unconsciously the roaming and drifting that took\r\nhim during the next five years all over the Middle States, and that\r\nmight well have wrecked the career of any one less persistent\r\nand industrious. It was a period of his life corresponding to the\r\nWanderjahre of the German artisan, and was an easy way of gratifying a\r\ntaste for travel without the risk of privation. To-day there is little\r\ntemptation to the telegrapher to go to distant parts of the country on\r\nthe chance that he may secure a livelihood at the key. The ranks are\r\nwell filled everywhere, and of late years the telegraph as an art or\r\nindustry has shown relatively slight expansion, owing chiefly to the\r\ndevelopment of telephony. Hence, if vacancies occur, there are plenty of\r\noperators available, and salaries have remained so low as to lead to one\r\nor two formidable and costly strikes that unfortunately took no account\r\nof the economic conditions of demand and supply. But in the days of the\r\nCivil War there was a great dearth of skilful manipulators of the key.\r\nAbout fifteen hundred of the best operators in the country were at the\r\nfront on the Federal side alone, and several hundred more had enlisted.\r\nThis created a serious scarcity, and a nomadic operator going to any\r\ntelegraphic centre would be sure to find a place open waiting for him.\r\nAt the close of the war a majority of those who had been with the two\r\nopposed armies remained at the key under more peaceful surroundings, but\r\nthe rapid development of the commercial and railroad systems fostered a\r\nnew demand, and then for a time it seemed almost impossible to train\r\nnew operators fast enough. In a few years, however, the telephone sprang\r\ninto vigorous existence, dating from 1876, drawing off some of the\r\nmost adventurous spirits from the telegraph field; and the deterrent\r\ninfluence of the telephone on the telegraph had made itself felt by\r\n1890. The expiration of the leading Bell telephone patents, five years\r\nlater, accentuated even more sharply the check that had been put\r\non telegraphy, as hundreds and thousands of \"independent\" telephone\r\ncompanies were then organized, throwing a vast network of toll lines\r\nover Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and other States, and affording\r\ncheap, instantaneous means of communication without any necessity for\r\nthe intervention of an operator.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the times have changed radically since Edison\r\nbecame a telegrapher, and that in this respect a chapter of electrical\r\nhistory has been definitely closed. There was a day when the art offered\r\na distinct career to all of its practitioners, and young men of ambition\r\nand good family were eager to begin even as messenger boys, and were\r\nready to undergo a severe ordeal of apprenticeship with the belief that\r\nthey could ultimately attain positions of responsibility and profit.\r\nAt the same time operators have always been shrewd enough to regard the\r\ntelegraph as a stepping-stone to other careers in life. A bright fellow\r\nentering the telegraph service to-day finds the experience he may\r\ngain therein valuable, but he soon realizes that there are not enough\r\ngood-paying official positions to \"go around,\" so as to give each worthy\r\nman a chance after he has mastered the essentials of the art. He feels,\r\ntherefore, that to remain at the key involves either stagnation or\r\ndeterioration, and that after, say, twenty-five years of practice he\r\nwill have lost ground as compared with friends who started out in other\r\noccupations. The craft of an operator, learned without much difficulty,\r\nis very attractive to a youth, but a position at the key is no place\r\nfor a man of mature years. His services, with rare exceptions, grow less\r\nvaluable as he advances in age and nervous strain breaks him down. On\r\nthe contrary, men engaged in other professions find, as a rule, that\r\nthey improve and advance with experience, and that age brings larger\r\nrewards and opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe list of well-known Americans who have been graduates of the key is\r\nindeed an extraordinary one, and there is no department of our national\r\nlife in which they have not distinguished themselves. The contrast,\r\nin this respect, between them and their European colleagues is highly\r\nsignificant. In Europe the telegraph systems are all under government\r\nmanagement, the operators have strictly limited spheres of promotion,\r\nand at the best the transition from one kind of employment to another is\r\nnot made so easily as in the New World. But in the United States we have\r\nseen Rufus Bullock become Governor of Georgia, and Ezra Cornell Governor\r\nof New York. Marshall Jewell was Postmaster-General of President\r\nGrant's Cabinet, and Daniel Lamont was Secretary of State in President\r\nCleveland's. Gen. T. T. Eckert, past-President of the Western Union\r\nTelegraph Company, was Assistant Secretary of War under President\r\nLincoln; and Robert J. Wynne, afterward a consul-general, served as\r\nAssistant Postmaster General. A very large proportion of the\r\npresidents and leading officials of the great railroad systems are old\r\ntelegraphers, including Messrs. W. C. Brown, President of the New York\r\nCentral Railroad, and Marvin Hughitt, President of the Chicago & North\r\nwestern Railroad. In industrial and financial life there have been\r\nTheodore N. Vail, President of the Bell telephone system; L. C. Weir,\r\nlate President of the Adams Express; A. B. Chandler, President of the\r\nPostal Telegraph and Cable Company; Sir W. Van Home, identified with\r\nCanadian development; Robert C. Clowry, President of the Western\r\nUnion Telegraph Company; D. H. Bates, Manager of the Baltimore &\r\nOhio telegraph for Robert Garrett; and Andrew Carnegie, the greatest\r\nironmaster the world has ever known, as well as its greatest\r\nphilanthropist. In journalism there have been leaders like Edward\r\nRosewater, founder of the Omaha Bee; W. J. Elverson, of the Philadelphia\r\nPress; and Frank A. Munsey, publisher of half a dozen big magazines.\r\nGeorge Kennan has achieved fame in literature, and Guy Carleton and\r\nHarry de Souchet have been successful as dramatists. These are but\r\ntypical of hundreds of men who could be named who have risen from\r\nwork at the key to become recognized leaders in differing spheres of\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nBut roving has never been favorable to the formation of steady habits.\r\nThe young men who thus floated about the country from one telegraph\r\noffice to another were often brilliant operators, noted for speed in\r\nsending and receiving, but they were undisciplined, were without the\r\nrestraining influences of home life, and were so highly paid for their\r\nwork that they could indulge freely in dissipation if inclined that way.\r\nSubjected to nervous tension for hours together at the key, many of them\r\nunfortunately took to drink, and having ended one engagement in a city\r\nby a debauch that closed the doors of the office to them, would drift\r\naway to the nearest town, and there securing work, would repeat the\r\nperformance. At one time, indeed, these men were so numerous and so\r\nmuch in evidence as to constitute a type that the public was disposed\r\nto accept as representative of the telegraphic fraternity; but as the\r\nconditions creating him ceased to exist, the \"tramp operator\" also\r\npassed into history. It was, however, among such characters that Edison\r\nwas very largely thrown in these early days of aimless drifting, to\r\nlearn something perhaps of their nonchalant philosophy of life, sharing\r\nbed and board with them under all kinds of adverse conditions, but\r\nalways maintaining a stoic abstemiousness, and never feeling other than\r\na keen regret at the waste of so much genuine ability and kindliness on\r\nthe part of those knights errant of the key whose inevitable fate might\r\nso easily have been his own.\r\n\r\nSuch a class or group of men can always be presented by an individual\r\ntype, and this is assuredly best embodied in Milton F. Adams, one of\r\nEdison's earliest and closest friends, to whom reference will be made in\r\nlater chapters, and whose life has been so full of adventurous episodes\r\nthat he might well be regarded as the modern Gil Blas. That career is\r\ncertainly well worth the telling as \"another story,\" to use the Kipling\r\nphrase. Of him Edison says: \"Adams was one of a class of operators never\r\nsatisfied to work at any place for any great length of time. He had the\r\n'wanderlust.' After enjoying hospitality in Boston in 1868-69, on the\r\nfloor of my hall-bedroom, which was a paradise for the entomologist,\r\nwhile the boarding-house itself was run on the banting system of flesh\r\nreduction, he came to me one day and said: 'Good-bye, Edison; I have\r\ngot sixty cents, and I am going to San Francisco.' And he did go. How, I\r\nnever knew personally. I learned afterward that he got a job there, and\r\nthen within a week they had a telegraphers' strike. He got a big\r\ntorch and sold patent medicine on the streets at night to support the\r\nstrikers. Then he went to Peru as partner of a man who had a grizzly\r\nbear which they proposed entering against a bull in the bull-ring in\r\nthat city. The grizzly was killed in five minutes, and so the scheme\r\ndied. Then Adams crossed the Andes, and started a market-report\r\nbureau in Buenos Ayres. This didn't pay, so he started a restaurant in\r\nPernambuco, Brazil. There he did very well, but something went wrong\r\n(as it always does to a nomad), so he went to the Transvaal, and ran a\r\npanorama called 'Paradise Lost' in the Kaffir kraals. This didn't pay,\r\nand he became the editor of a newspaper; then went to England to raise\r\nmoney for a railroad in Cape Colony. Next I heard of him in New York,\r\nhaving just arrived from Bogota, United States of Colombia, with a power\r\nof attorney and $2000 from a native of that republic, who had applied\r\nfor a patent for tightening a belt to prevent it from slipping on a\r\npulley--a device which he thought a new and great invention, but which\r\nwas in use ever since machinery was invented. I gave Adams, then, a\r\nposition as salesman for electrical apparatus. This he soon got tired\r\nof, and I lost sight of him.\" Adams, in speaking of this episode, says\r\nthat when he asked for transportation expenses to St. Louis, Edison\r\npulled out of his pocket a ferry ticket to Hoboken, and said to his\r\nassociates: \"I'll give him that, and he'll get there all right.\" This\r\nwas in the early days of electric lighting; but down to the present\r\nmoment the peregrinations of this versatile genius of the key have never\r\nceased in one hemisphere or the other, so that as Mr. Adams himself\r\nremarked to the authors in April, 1908: \"The life has been somewhat\r\nvariegated, but never dull.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact remains also that throughout this period Edison, while himself\r\na very Ishmael, never ceased to study, explore, experiment. Referring\r\nto this beginning of his career, he mentions a curious fact that\r\nthrows light on his ceaseless application. \"After I became a telegraph\r\noperator,\" he says, \"I practiced for a long time to become a rapid\r\nreader of print, and got so expert I could sense the meaning of a whole\r\nline at once. This faculty, I believe, should be taught in schools, as\r\nit appears to be easily acquired. Then one can read two or three books\r\nin a day, whereas if each word at a time only is sensed, reading is\r\nlaborious.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nARDUOUS YEARS IN THE CENTRAL WEST\r\n\r\nIN 1903, when accepting the position of honorary electrician to the\r\nInternational Exposition held in St. Louis in 1904, to commemorate the\r\ncentenary of the Louisiana Purchase, Mr. Edison spoke in his letter\r\nof the Central West as a \"region where as a young telegraph operator I\r\nspent many arduous years before moving East.\" The term of probation\r\nthus referred to did not end until 1868, and while it lasted Edison's\r\nwanderings carried him from Detroit to New Orleans, and took him, among\r\nother cities, to Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Memphis, some\r\nof which he visited twice in his peregrinations to secure work. From\r\nCanada, after the episodes noted in the last chapter, he went to Adrian,\r\nMichigan, and of what happened there Edison tells a story typical of\r\nhis wanderings for several years to come. \"After leaving my first job\r\nat Stratford Junction, I got a position as operator on the Lake Shore &\r\nMichigan Southern at Adrian, Michigan, in the division superintendent's\r\noffice. As usual, I took the 'night trick,' which most operators\r\ndisliked, but which I preferred, as it gave me more leisure to\r\nexperiment. I had obtained from the station agent a small room, and had\r\nestablished a little shop of my own. One day the day operator wanted to\r\nget off, and I was on duty. About 9 o'clock the superintendent handed me\r\na despatch which he said was very important, and which I must get off at\r\nonce. The wire at the time was very busy, and I asked if I should\r\nbreak in. I got orders to do so, and acting under those orders of the\r\nsuperintendent, I broke in and tried to send the despatch; but the\r\nother operator would not permit it, and the struggle continued for ten\r\nminutes. Finally I got possession of the wire and sent the message. The\r\nsuperintendent of telegraph, who then lived in Adrian and went to his\r\noffice in Toledo every day, happened that day to be in the Western Union\r\noffice up-town--and it was the superintendent I was really struggling\r\nwith! In about twenty minutes he arrived livid with rage, and I was\r\ndischarged on the spot. I informed him that the general superintendent\r\nhad told me to break in and send the despatch, but the general\r\nsuperintendent then and there repudiated the whole thing. Their families\r\nwere socially close, so I was sacrificed. My faith in human nature got a\r\nslight jar.\"\r\n\r\nEdison then went to Toledo and secured a position at Fort Wayne, on the\r\nPittsburg, Fort Wayne & Chicago Railroad, now leased to the Pennsylvania\r\nsystem. This was a \"day job,\" and he did not like it. He drifted two\r\nmonths later to Indianapolis, arriving there in the fall of 1864, when\r\nhe was at first assigned to duty at the Union Station at a salary of $75\r\na month for the Western Union Telegraph Company, whose service he\r\nnow entered, and with which he has been destined to maintain highly\r\nimportant and close relationships throughout a large part of his life.\r\nSuperintendent Wallick appears to have treated him generously and to\r\nhave loaned him instruments, a kindness that was greatly appreciated,\r\nfor twenty years later the inventor called on his old employer, and\r\ntogether they visited the scene where the borrowed apparatus had been\r\nmounted on a rough board in the depot. Edison did not stay long in\r\nIndianapolis, however, resigning in February, 1865, and proceeding to\r\nCincinnati. The transfer was possibly due to trouble caused by one of\r\nhis early inventions embodying what has been characterized by an expert\r\nas \"probably the most simple and ingenious arrangement of connections\r\nfor a repeater.\" His ambition was to take \"press report,\" but finding,\r\neven after considerable practice, that he \"broke\" frequently, he\r\nadjusted two embossing Morse registers--one to receive the press\r\nmatter, and the other to repeat the dots and dashes at a lower speed, so\r\nthat the message could be copied leisurely. Hence he could not be rushed\r\nor \"broken\" in receiving, while he could turn out \"copy\" that was a\r\nmarvel of neatness and clearness. All was well so long as ordinary\r\nconditions prevailed, but when an unusual pressure occurred the little\r\nsystem fell behind, and the newspapers complained of the slowness with\r\nwhich reports were delivered to them. It is easy to understand that with\r\nmatter received at a rate of forty words per minute and worked off at\r\ntwenty-five words per minute a serious congestion or delay would result,\r\nand the newspapers were more anxious for the news than they were for\r\nfine penmanship.\r\n\r\nOf this device Mr. Edison remarks: \"Together we took press for several\r\nnights, my companion keeping the apparatus in adjustment and I copying.\r\nThe regular press operator would go to the theatre or take a nap, only\r\nfinishing the report after 1 A.M. One of the newspapers complained of\r\nbad copy toward the end of the report--that, is from 1 to 3 A.M., and\r\nrequested that the operator taking the report up to 1 A.M.--which was\r\nourselves--take it all, as the copy then was perfectly unobjectionable.\r\nThis led to an investigation by the manager, and the scheme was\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\n\"This instrument, many years afterward, was applied by me for\r\ntransferring messages from one wire to any other wire simultaneously,\r\nor after any interval of time. It consisted of a disk of paper, the\r\nindentations being formed in a volute spiral, exactly as in the disk\r\nphonograph to-day. It was this instrument which gave me the idea of the\r\nphonograph while working on the telephone.\"\r\n\r\nArrived in Cincinnati, where he got employment in the Western Union\r\ncommercial telegraph department at a wage of $60 per month, Edison\r\nmade the acquaintance of Milton F. Adams, already referred to as facile\r\nprinceps the typical telegrapher in all his more sociable and brilliant\r\naspects. Speaking of that time, Mr. Adams says: \"I can well recall when\r\nEdison drifted in to take a job. He was a youth of about eighteen years,\r\ndecidedly unprepossessing in dress and rather uncouth in manner. I was\r\ntwenty-one, and very dudish. He was quite thin in those days, and his\r\nnose was very prominent, giving a Napoleonic look to his face, although\r\nthe curious resemblance did not strike me at the time. The boys did not\r\ntake to him cheerfully, and he was lonesome. I sympathized with him, and\r\nwe became close companions. As an operator he had no superiors and very\r\nfew equals. Most of the time he was monkeying with the batteries and\r\ncircuits, and devising things to make the work of telegraphy less\r\nirksome. He also relieved the monotony of office-work by fitting up the\r\nbattery circuits to play jokes on his fellow-operators, and to deal with\r\nthe vermin that infested the premises. He arranged in the cellar what he\r\ncalled his 'rat paralyzer,' a very simple contrivance consisting of two\r\nplates insulated from each other and connected with the main battery.\r\nThey were so placed that when a rat passed over them the fore feet on\r\nthe one plate and the hind feet on the other completed the circuit and\r\nthe rat departed this life, electrocuted.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after Edison's arrival at Cincinnati came the close of the Civil\r\nWar and the assassination of President Lincoln. It was natural that\r\ntelegraphers should take an intense interest in the general struggle,\r\nfor not only did they handle all the news relating to it, but many of\r\nthem were at one time or another personal participants. For example, one\r\nof the operators in the Cincinnati office was George Ellsworth, who was\r\ntelegrapher for Morgan, the famous Southern Guerrilla, and was with him\r\nwhen he made his raid into Ohio and was captured near the Pennsylvania\r\nline. Ellsworth himself made a narrow escape by swimming the Ohio\r\nRiver with the aid of an army mule. Yet we can well appreciate the\r\nunimpressionable way in which some of the men did their work, from an\r\nanecdote that Mr. Edison tells of that awful night of Friday, April 14,\r\n1865: \"I noticed,\" he says, \"an immense crowd gathering in the street\r\noutside a newspaper office. I called the attention of the other\r\noperators to the crowd, and we sent a messenger boy to find the cause\r\nof the excitement. He returned in a few minutes and shouted 'Lincoln's\r\nshot.' Instinctively the operators looked from one face to another to\r\nsee which man had received the news. All the faces were blank, and every\r\nman said he had not taken a word about the shooting. 'Look over your\r\nfiles,' said the boss to the man handling the press stuff. For a few\r\nmoments we waited in suspense, and then the man held up a sheet of\r\npaper containing a short account of the shooting of the President. The\r\noperator had worked so mechanically that he had handled the news without\r\nthe slightest knowledge of its significance.\" Mr. Adams says that at the\r\ntime the city was en fete on account of the close of the war, the name\r\nof the assassin was received by telegraph, and it was noted with a\r\nthrill of horror that it was that of a brother of Edwin Booth and of\r\nJunius Brutus Booth--the latter of whom was then playing at the old\r\nNational Theatre. Booth was hurried away into seclusion, and the next\r\nmorning the city that had been so gay over night with bunting was draped\r\nwith mourning.\r\n\r\nEdison's diversions in Cincinnati were chiefly those already observed.\r\nHe read a great deal, but spent most of his leisure in experiment. Mr.\r\nAdams remarks: \"Edison and I were very fond of tragedy. Forrest and John\r\nMcCullough were playing at the National Theatre, and when our capital\r\nwas sufficient we would go to see those eminent tragedians alternate in\r\nOthello and Iago. Edison always enjoyed Othello greatly. Aside from an\r\noccasional visit to the Loewen Garden 'over the Rhine,' with a glass of\r\nbeer and a few pretzels, consumed while listening to the excellent music\r\nof a German band, the theatre was the sum and substance of our innocent\r\ndissipation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati office, as a central point, appears to have been\r\nattractive to many of the clever young operators who graduated from it\r\nto positions of larger responsibility. Some of them were conspicuous for\r\ntheir skill and versatility. Mr. Adams tells this interesting story as\r\nan illustration: \"L. C. Weir, or Charlie, as he was known, at that\r\ntime agent for the Adams Express Company, had the remarkable ability of\r\ntaking messages and copying them twenty-five words behind the sender.\r\nOne day he came into the operating-room, and passing a table he heard\r\nLouisville calling Cincinnati. He reached over to the key and answered\r\nthe call. My attention was arrested by the fact that he walked off after\r\nresponding, and the sender happened to be a good one. Weir coolly asked\r\nfor a pen, and when he sat down the sender was just one message ahead\r\nof him with date, address, and signature. Charlie started in, and in a\r\nbeautiful, large, round hand copied that message. The sender went right\r\nalong, and when he finished with six messages closed his key. When Weir\r\nhad done with the last one the sender began to think that after all\r\nthere had been no receiver, as Weir did not 'break,' but simply gave\r\nhis O. K. He afterward became president of the Adams Express, and was\r\ncertainly a wonderful operator.\" The operating-room referred to was on\r\nthe fifth floor of the building with no elevators.\r\n\r\nThose were the early days of trade unionism in telegraphy, and the\r\nmovement will probably never quite die out in the craft which has always\r\nshown so much solidarity. While Edison was in Cincinnati a delegation\r\nof five union operators went over from Cleveland to form a local branch,\r\nand the occasion was one of great conviviality. Night came, but the\r\nunionists were conspicuous by their absence, although more circuits than\r\none were intolerant of delay and clamorous for attention---eight local\r\nunionists being away. The Cleveland report wire was in special need, and\r\nEdison, almost alone in the office, devoted himself to it all through\r\nthe night and until 3 o'clock the next morning, when he was relieved.\r\n\r\nHe had previously been getting $80 a month, and had eked this out\r\nby copying plays for the theatre. His rating was that of a \"plug\" or\r\ninferior operator; but he was determined to lift himself into the class\r\nof first-class operators, and had kept up the practice of going to the\r\noffice at night to \"copy press,\" acting willingly as a substitute for\r\nany operator who wanted to get off for a few hours--which often meant\r\nall night. Speaking of this special ordeal, for which he had thus been\r\nunconsciously preparing, Edison says: \"My copy looked fine if viewed\r\nas a whole, as I could write a perfectly straight line across the wide\r\nsheet, which was not ruled. There were no flourishes, but the individual\r\nletters would not bear close inspection. When I missed understanding a\r\nword, there was no time to think what it was, so I made an illegible one\r\nto fill in, trusting to the printers to sense it. I knew they could read\r\nanything, although Mr. Bloss, an editor of the Inquirer, made such bad\r\ncopy that one of his editorials was pasted up on the notice-board in the\r\ntelegraph office with an offer of one dollar to any man who could 'read\r\ntwenty consecutive words.' Nobody ever did it. When I got through I\r\nwas too nervous to go home, so waited the rest of the night for the day\r\nmanager, Mr. Stevens, to see what was to be the outcome of this Union\r\nformation and of my efforts. He was an austere man, and I was afraid of\r\nhim. I got the morning papers, which came out at 4 A. M., and the press\r\nreport read perfectly, which surprised me greatly. I went to work on\r\nmy regular day wire to Portsmouth, Ohio, and there was considerable\r\nexcitement, but nothing was said to me, neither did Mr. Stevens examine\r\nthe copy on the office hook, which I was watching with great interest.\r\nHowever, about 3 P. M. he went to the hook, grabbed the bunch and\r\nlooked at it as a whole without examining it in detail, for which I\r\nwas thankful. Then he jabbed it back on the hook, and I knew I was all\r\nright. He walked over to me, and said: 'Young man, I want you to work\r\nthe Louisville wire nights; your salary will be $125.' Thus I got from\r\nthe plug classification to that of a 'first-class man.'\"\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was this promotion secured than he started again on his\r\nwanderings southward, while his friend Adams went North, neither\r\nhaving any difficulty in making the trip. \"The boys in those days\r\nhad extraordinary facilities for travel. As a usual thing it was only\r\nnecessary for them to board a train and tell the conductor they were\r\noperators. Then they would go as far as they liked. The number of\r\noperators was small, and they were in demand everywhere.\" It was in this\r\nway Edison made his way south as far as Memphis, Tennessee, where the\r\ntelegraph service at that time was under military law, although the\r\noperators received $125 a month. Here again Edison began to invent and\r\nimprove on existing apparatus, with the result of having once more to\r\n\"move on.\" The story may be told in his own terse language: \"I was not\r\nthe inventor of the auto repeater, but while in Memphis I worked on\r\none. Learning that the chief operator, who was a protege of the\r\nsuperintendent, was trying in some way to put New York and New Orleans\r\ntogether for the first time since the close of the war, I redoubled my\r\nefforts, and at 2 o'clock one morning I had them speaking to each other.\r\nThe office of the Memphis Avalanche was in the same building. The paper\r\ngot wind of it and sent messages. A column came out in the morning about\r\nit; but when I went to the office in the afternoon to report for duty I\r\nwas discharged with out explanation. The superintendent would not even\r\ngive me a pass to Nashville, so I had to pay my fare. I had so little\r\nmoney left that I nearly starved at Decatur, Alabama, and had to stay\r\nthree days before going on north to Nashville. Arrived in that city,\r\nI went to the telegraph office, got money enough to buy a little solid\r\nfood, and secured a pass to Louisville. I had a companion with me who\r\nwas also out of a job. I arrived at Louisville on a bitterly cold day,\r\nwith ice in the gutters. I was wearing a linen duster and was not much\r\nto look at, but got a position at once, working on a press wire. My\r\ntravelling companion was less successful on account of his 'record.'\r\nThey had a limit even in those days when the telegraph service was so\r\ndemoralized.\"\r\n\r\nSome reminiscences of Mr. Edison are of interest as bearing not only\r\nupon the \"demoralized\" telegraph service, but the conditions from\r\nwhich the New South had to emerge while working out its salvation. \"The\r\ntelegraph was still under military control, not having been turned over\r\nto the original owners, the Southern Telegraph Company. In addition to\r\nthe regular force, there was an extra force of two or three operators,\r\nand some stranded ones, who were a burden to us, for board was high.\r\nOne of these derelicts was a great source of worry to me, personally. He\r\nwould come in at all hours and either throw ink around or make a lot\r\nof noise. One night he built a fire in the grate and started to throw\r\npistol cartridges into the flames. These would explode, and I was twice\r\nhit by the bullets, which left a black-and-blue mark. Another night he\r\ncame in and got from some part of the building a lot of stationery with\r\n'Confederate States' printed at the head. He was a fine operator, and\r\nwrote a beautiful hand. He would take a sheet of this paper, write\r\ncapital 'A', and then take another sheet and make the 'A' differently;\r\nand so on through the alphabet; each time crumpling the paper up in his\r\nhand and throwing it on the floor. He would keep this up until the room\r\nwas filled nearly flush with the table. Then he would quit.\r\n\r\n\"Everything at that time was 'wide open.' Disorganization reigned\r\nsupreme. There was no head to anything. At night myself and a companion\r\nwould go over to a gorgeously furnished faro-bank and get our midnight\r\nlunch. Everything was free. There were over twenty keno-rooms running.\r\nOne of them that I visited was in a Baptist church, the man with the\r\nwheel being in the pulpit, and the gamblers in the pews.\r\n\r\n\"While there the manager of the telegraph office was arrested for\r\nsomething I never understood, and incarcerated in a military prison\r\nabout half a mile from the office. The building was in plain sight from\r\nthe office, and four stories high. He was kept strictly incommunicado.\r\nOne day, thinking he might be confined in a room facing the office, I\r\nput my arm out of the window and kept signalling dots and dashes by the\r\nmovement of the arm. I tried this several times for two days. Finally\r\nhe noticed it, and putting his arm through the bars of the window he\r\nestablished communication with me. He thus sent several messages to his\r\nfriends, and was afterward set free.\"\r\n\r\nAnother curious story told by Edison concerns a fellow-operator on night\r\nduty at Chattanooga Junction, at the time he was at Memphis: \"When it\r\nwas reported that Hood was marching on Nashville, one night a Jew came\r\ninto the office about 11 o'clock in great excitement, having heard the\r\nHood rumor. He, being a large sutler, wanted to send a message to save\r\nhis goods. The operator said it was impossible--that orders had been\r\ngiven to send no private messages. Then the Jew wanted to bribe my\r\nfriend, who steadfastly refused for the reason, as he told the Jew, that\r\nhe might be court-martialled and shot. Finally the Jew got up to $800.\r\nThe operator swore him to secrecy and sent the message. Now there was\r\nno such order about private messages, and the Jew, finding it out,\r\ncomplained to Captain Van Duzer, chief of telegraphs, who investigated\r\nthe matter, and while he would not discharge the operator, laid him\r\noff indefinitely. Van Duzer was so lenient that if an operator were\r\ndischarged, all the operator had to do was to wait three days and then\r\ngo and sit on the stoop of Van Duzer's office all day, and he would be\r\ntaken back. But Van Duzer swore he would never give in in this case.\r\nHe said that if the operator had taken $800 and sent the message at the\r\nregular rate, which was twenty-five cents, it would have been all right,\r\nas the Jew would be punished for trying to bribe a military operator;\r\nbut when the operator took the $800 and then sent the message deadhead,\r\nhe couldn't stand it, and he would never relent.\"\r\n\r\nA third typical story of this period deals with a cipher message for\r\nThomas. Mr. Edison narrates it as follows: \"When I was an operator in\r\nCincinnati working the Louisville wire nights for a time, one night a\r\nman over on the Pittsburg wire yelled out: 'D. I. cipher,' which meant\r\nthat there was a cipher message from the War Department at Washington\r\nand that it was coming--and he yelled out 'Louisville.' I started\r\nimmediately to call up that place. It was just at the change of shift in\r\nthe office. I could not get Louisville, and the cipher message began to\r\ncome. It was taken by the operator on the other table direct from the\r\nWar Department. It was for General Thomas, at Nashville. I called for\r\nabout twenty minutes and notified them that I could not get Louisville.\r\nI kept at it for about fifteen minutes longer, and notified them that\r\nthere was still no answer from Louisville. They then notified the War\r\nDepartment that they could not get Louisville. Then we tried to get it\r\nby all kinds of roundabout ways, but in no case could anybody get them\r\nat that office. Soon a message came from the War Department to send\r\nimmediately for the manager of the Cincinnati office. He was brought to\r\nthe office and several messages were exchanged, the contents of which,\r\nof course, I did not know, but the matter appeared to be very serious,\r\nas they were afraid of General Hood, of the Confederate Army, who was\r\nthen attempting to march on Nashville; and it was very important that\r\nthis cipher of about twelve hundred words or so should be got through\r\nimmediately to General Thomas. I kept on calling up to 12 or 1 o'clock,\r\nbut no Louisville. About 1 o'clock the operator at the Indianapolis\r\noffice got hold of an operator on a wire which ran from Indianapolis to\r\nLouisville along the railroad, who happened to come into his office. He\r\narranged with this operator to get a relay of horses, and the message\r\nwas sent through Indianapolis to this operator who had engaged horses to\r\ncarry the despatches to Louisville and find out the trouble, and get the\r\ndespatches through without delay to General Thomas. In those days the\r\ntelegraph fraternity was rather demoralized, and the discipline was very\r\nlax. It was found out a couple of days afterward that there were\r\nthree night operators at Louisville. One of them had gone over to\r\nJeffersonville and had fallen off a horse and broken his leg, and was\r\nin a hospital. By a remarkable coincidence another of the men had\r\nbeen stabbed in a keno-room, and was also in hospital while the third\r\noperator had gone to Cynthiana to see a man hanged and had got left by\r\nthe train.\"\r\n\r\n     I think the most important line of\r\n     investigation is the production of\r\n     Electricity direct from carbon.\r\n     Edison\r\n\r\nYoung Edison remained in Louisville for about two years, quite a long\r\nstay for one with such nomadic instincts. It was there that he perfected\r\nthe peculiar vertical style of writing which, beginning with him in\r\ntelegraphy, later became so much of a fad with teachers of penmanship\r\nand in the schools. He says of this form of writing, a current example\r\nof which is given above: \"I developed this style in Louisville while\r\ntaking press reports. My wire was connected to the 'blind' side of a\r\nrepeater at Cincinnati, so that if I missed a word or sentence, or if\r\nthe wire worked badly, I could not break in and get the last words,\r\nbecause the Cincinnati man had no instrument by which he could hear me.\r\nI had to take what came. When I got the job, the cable across the\r\nOhio River at Covington, connecting with the line to Louisville, had a\r\nvariable leak in it, which caused the strength of the signalling current\r\nto make violent fluctuations. I obviated this by using several relays,\r\neach with a different adjustment, working several sounders all connected\r\nwith one sounding-plate. The clatter was bad, but I could read it with\r\nfair ease. When, in addition to this infernal leak, the wires north to\r\nCleveland worked badly, it required a large amount of imagination to get\r\nthe sense of what was being sent. An imagination requires an appreciable\r\ntime for its exercise, and as the stuff was coming at the rate of\r\nthirty-five to forty words a minute, it was very difficult to write down\r\nwhat was coming and imagine what wasn't coming. Hence it was necessary\r\nto become a very rapid writer, so I started to find the fastest style. I\r\nfound that the vertical style, with each letter separate and without\r\nany flourishes, was the most rapid, and that the smaller the letter\r\nthe greater the rapidity. As I took on an average from eight to fifteen\r\ncolumns of news report every day, it did not take long to perfect\r\nthis method.\" Mr. Edison has adhered to this characteristic style of\r\npenmanship down to the present time.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the conditions at Louisville at that time were not\r\nmuch better than they had been at Memphis. The telegraph operating-room\r\nwas in a deplorable condition. It was on the second story of a\r\ndilapidated building on the principal street of the city, with the\r\nbattery-room in the rear; behind which was the office of the agent of\r\nthe Associated Press. The plastering was about one-third gone from the\r\nceiling. A small stove, used occasionally in the winter, was connected\r\nto the chimney by a tortuous pipe. The office was never cleaned. The\r\nswitchboard for manipulating the wires was about thirty-four inches\r\nsquare. The brass connections on it were black with age and with the\r\narcing effects of lightning, which, to young Edison, seemed particularly\r\npartial to Louisville. \"It would strike on the wires,\" he says, \"with\r\nan explosion like a cannon-shot, making that office no place for an\r\noperator with heart-disease.\" Around the dingy walls were a dozen\r\ntables, the ends next to the wall. They were about the size of those\r\nseen in old-fashioned country hotels for holding the wash-bowl and\r\npitcher. The copper wires connecting the instruments to the switchboard\r\nwere small, crystallized, and rotten. The battery-room was filled\r\nwith old record-books and message bundles, and one hundred cells of\r\nnitric-acid battery, arranged on a stand in the centre of the room. This\r\nstand, as well as the floor, was almost eaten through by the destructive\r\naction of the powerful acid. Grim and uncompromising as the description\r\nreads, it was typical of the equipment in those remote days of the\r\ntelegraph at the close of the war.\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the length to which telegraphers could go at a time when\r\nthey were so much in demand, Edison tells the following story: \"When I\r\ntook the position there was a great shortage of operators. One night at\r\n2 A.M. another operator and I were on duty. I was taking press report,\r\nand the other man was working the New York wire. We heard a heavy tramp,\r\ntramp, tramp on the rickety stairs. Suddenly the door was thrown\r\nopen with great violence, dislodging it from one of the hinges. There\r\nappeared in the doorway one of the best operators we had, who\r\nworked daytime, and who was of a very quiet disposition except when\r\nintoxicated. He was a great friend of the manager of the office. His\r\neyes were bloodshot and wild, and one sleeve had been torn away from his\r\ncoat. Without noticing either of us he went up to the stove and kicked\r\nit over. The stove-pipe fell, dislocated at every joint. It was half\r\nfull of exceedingly fine soot, which floated out and filled the room\r\ncompletely. This produced a momentary respite to his labors. When the\r\natmosphere had cleared sufficiently to see, he went around and pulled\r\nevery table away from the wall, piling them on top of the stove in the\r\nmiddle of the room. Then he proceeded to pull the switchboard away from\r\nthe wall. It was held tightly by screws. He succeeded, finally, and when\r\nit gave way he fell with the board, and striking on a table cut\r\nhimself so that he soon became covered with blood. He then went to the\r\nbattery-room and knocked all the batteries off on the floor. The nitric\r\nacid soon began to combine with the plaster in the room below, which\r\nwas the public receiving-room for messengers and bookkeepers. The excess\r\nacid poured through and ate up the account-books. After having finished\r\neverything to his satisfaction, he left. I told the other operator to\r\ndo nothing. We would leave things just as they were, and wait until the\r\nmanager came. In the mean time, as I knew all the wires coming through\r\nto the switchboard, I rigged up a temporary set of instruments so that\r\nthe New York business could be cleared up, and we also got the remainder\r\nof the press matter. At 7 o'clock the day men began to appear. They were\r\ntold to go down-stairs and wait the coming of the manager. At 8 o'clock\r\nhe appeared, walked around, went into the battery-room, and then came to\r\nme, saying: 'Edison, who did this?' I told him that Billy L. had come in\r\nfull of soda-water and invented the ruin before him. He walked backward\r\nand forward, about a minute, then coming up to my table put his fist\r\ndown, and said: 'If Billy L. ever does that again, I will discharge\r\nhim.' It was needless to say that there were other operators who took\r\nadvantage of that kind of discipline, and I had many calls at night\r\nafter that, but none with such destructive effects.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one aspect of life as it presented itself to the sensitive\r\nand observant young operator in Louisville. But there was another,\r\nmore intellectual side, in the contact afforded with journalism and its\r\nleaders, and the information taken in almost unconsciously as to the\r\npolitical and social movements of the time. Mr. Edison looks back on\r\nthis with great satisfaction. \"I remember,\" he says, \"the discussions\r\nbetween the celebrated poet and journalist George D. Prentice, then\r\neditor of the Courier-Journal, and Mr. Tyler, of the Associated Press.\r\nI believe Prentice was the father of the humorous paragraph of the\r\nAmerican newspaper. He was poetic, highly educated, and a brilliant\r\ntalker. He was very thin and small. I do not think he weighed over one\r\nhundred and twenty five pounds. Tyler was a graduate of Harvard, and had\r\na very clear enunciation, and, in sharp contrast to Prentice, he was a\r\nlarge man. After the paper had gone to press, Prentice would generally\r\ncome over to Tyler's office and start talking. Having while in Tyler's\r\noffice heard them arguing on the immortality of the soul, etc., I asked\r\npermission of Mr. Tyler if, after finishing the press matter, I might\r\ncome in and listen to the conversation, which I did many times after.\r\nOne thing I never could comprehend was that Tyler had a sideboard with\r\nliquors and generally crackers. Prentice would pour out half a glass of\r\nwhat they call corn whiskey, and would dip the crackers in it and eat\r\nthem. Tyler took it sans food. One teaspoonful of that stuff would put\r\nme to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edison throws also a curious side-light on the origin of the comic\r\ncolumn in the modern American newspaper, the telegraph giving to a new\r\njoke or a good story the ubiquity and instantaneity of an important\r\nhistorical event. \"It was the practice of the press operators all over\r\nthe country at that time, when a lull occurred, to start in and send\r\njokes or stories the day men had collected; and these were copied and\r\npasted up on the bulletin-board. Cleveland was the originating\r\noffice for 'press,' which it received from New York, and sent it out\r\nsimultaneously to Milwaukee, Chicago, Toledo, Detroit, Pittsburg,\r\nColumbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Vincennes, Terre Haute, St.\r\nLouis, and Louisville. Cleveland would call first on Milwaukee, if he\r\nhad anything. If so, he would send it, and Cleveland would repeat it to\r\nall of us. Thus any joke or story originating anywhere in that area\r\nwas known the next day all over. The press men would come in and copy\r\nanything which could be published, which was about three per cent. I\r\ncollected, too, quite a large scrap-book of it, but unfortunately have\r\nlost it.\"\r\n\r\nEdison tells an amusing story of his own pursuits at this time. Always\r\nan omnivorous reader, he had some difficulty in getting a sufficient\r\nquantity of literature for home consumption, and was in the habit\r\nof buying books at auctions and second-hand stores. One day at an\r\nauction-room he secured a stack of twenty unbound volumes of the North\r\nAmerican Review for two dollars. These he had bound and delivered at the\r\ntelegraph office. One morning, when he was free as usual at 3 o'clock,\r\nhe started off at a rapid pace with ten volumes on his shoulder. He\r\nfound himself very soon the subject of a fusillade. When he stopped, a\r\nbreathless policeman grabbed him by the throat and ordered him to drop\r\nhis parcel and explain matters, as a suspicious character. He opened the\r\npackage showing the books, somewhat to the disgust of the officer, who\r\nimagined he had caught a burglar sneaking away in the dark alley with\r\nhis booty. Edison explained that being deaf he had heard no challenge,\r\nand therefore had kept moving; and the policeman remarked apologetically\r\nthat it was fortunate for Edison he was not a better shot.\r\n\r\nThe incident is curiously revelatory of the character of the man, for\r\nit must be admitted that while literary telegraphers are by no means\r\nscarce, there are very few who would spend scant savings on back numbers\r\nof a ponderous review at an age when tragedy, beer, and pretzels are far\r\nmore enticing. Through all his travels Edison has preserved those books,\r\nand has them now in his library at Llewellyn Park, on Orange Mountain,\r\nNew Jersey.\r\n\r\nDrifting after a time from Louisville, Edison made his way as far north\r\nas Detroit, but, like the famous Duke of York, soon made his way back\r\nagain. Possibly the severer discipline after the happy-go-lucky regime\r\nin the Southern city had something to do with this restlessness, which\r\nagain manifested itself, however, on his return thither. The end of the\r\nwar had left the South a scene of destruction and desolation, and\r\nmany men who had fought bravely and well found it hard to reconcile\r\nthemselves to the grim task of reconstruction. To them it seemed better\r\nto \"let ill alone\" and seek some other clime where conditions would\r\nbe less onerous. At this moment a great deal of exaggerated talk was\r\ncurrent as to the sunny life and easy wealth of Latin America, and under\r\nits influences many \"unreconstructed\" Southerners made their way\r\nto Mexico, Brazil, Peru, or the Argentine. Telegraph operators were\r\nnaturally in touch with this movement, and Edison's fertile\r\nimagination was readily inflamed by the glowing idea of all these vague\r\npossibilities. Again he threw up his steady work and, with a couple of\r\nsanguine young friends, made his way to New Orleans. They had the\r\nnotion of taking positions in the Brazilian Government telegraphs, as\r\nan advertisement had been inserted in some paper stating that operators\r\nwere wanted. They had timed their departure from Louisville so as to\r\ncatch a specially chartered steamer, which was to leave New Orleans for\r\nBrazil on a certain day, to convey a large number of Confederates and\r\ntheir families, who were disgusted with the United States and were\r\ngoing to settle in Brazil, where slavery still prevailed. Edison and his\r\nfriends arrived in New Orleans just at the time of the great riot, when\r\nseveral hundred negroes were killed, and the city was in the hands of\r\na mob. The Government had seized the steamer chartered for Brazil, in\r\norder to bring troops from the Yazoo River to New Orleans to stop the\r\nrioting. The young operators therefore visited another shipping-office\r\nto make inquiries as to vessels for Brazil, and encountered an old\r\nSpaniard who sat in a chair near the steamer agent's desk, and to\r\nwhom they explained their intentions. He had lived and worked in South\r\nAmerica, and was very emphatic in his assertion, as he shook his yellow,\r\nbony finger at them, that the worst mistake they could possibly make\r\nwould be to leave the United States. He would not leave on any account,\r\nand they as young Americans would always regret it if they forsook their\r\nnative land, whose freedom, climate, and opportunities could not be\r\nequalled anywhere on the face of the globe. Such sincere advice as this\r\ncould not be disdained, and Edison made his way North again. One cannot\r\nresist speculation as to what might have happened to Edison himself and\r\nto the development of electricity had he made this proposed plunge into\r\nthe enervating tropics. It will be remembered that at a somewhat similar\r\ncrisis in life young Robert Burns entertained seriously the idea of\r\nforsaking Scotland for the West Indies. That he did not go was certainly\r\nbetter for Scottish verse, to which he contributed later so many\r\nimmortal lines; and it was probably better for himself, even if he died\r\na gauger. It is simply impossible to imagine Edison working out the\r\nphonograph, telephone, and incandescent lamp under the tropical climes\r\nhe sought. Some years later he was informed that both his companions had\r\ngone to Vera Cruz, Mexico, and had died there of yellow fever.\r\n\r\nWork was soon resumed at Louisville, where the dilapidated old office\r\noccupied at the close of the war had been exchanged for one much more\r\ncomfortable and luxurious in its equipment. As before, Edison was\r\nallotted to press report, and remembers very distinctly taking the\r\nPresidential message and veto of the District of Columbia bill\r\nby President Johnson. As the matter was received over the wire he\r\nparagraphed it so that each printer had exactly three lines, thus\r\nenabling the matter to be set up very expeditiously in the newspaper\r\noffices. This earned him the gratitude of the editors, a dinner, and all\r\nthe newspaper \"exchanges\" he wanted. Edison's accounts of the sprees and\r\ndebauches of other night operators in the loosely managed offices enable\r\none to understand how even a little steady application to the work in\r\nhand would be appreciated. On one occasion Edison acted as treasurer for\r\nhis bibulous companions, holding the stakes, so to speak, in order that\r\nthe supply of liquor might last longer. One of the mildest mannered of\r\nthe party took umbrage at the parsimony of the treasurer and knocked\r\nhim down, whereupon the others in the party set upon the assailant and\r\nmauled him so badly that he had to spend three weeks in hospital. At\r\nanother time two of his companions sharing the temporary hospitality of\r\nhis room smashed most of the furniture, and went to bed with their boots\r\non. Then his kindly good-nature rebelled. \"I felt that this was running\r\nhospitality into the ground, so I pulled them out and left them on the\r\nfloor to cool off from their alcoholic trance.\"\r\n\r\nEdison seems on the whole to have been fairly comfortable and happy in\r\nLouisville, surrounding himself with books and experimental apparatus,\r\nand even inditing a treatise on electricity. But his very thirst for\r\nknowledge and new facts again proved his undoing. The instruments in the\r\nhandsome new offices were fastened in their proper places, and operators\r\nwere strictly forbidden to remove them, or to use the batteries except\r\non regular work. This prohibition meant little to Edison, who had access\r\nto no other instruments except those of the company. \"I went one night,\"\r\nhe says, \"into the battery-room to obtain some sulphuric acid for\r\nexperimenting. The carboy tipped over, the acid ran out, went through\r\nto the manager's room below, and ate up his desk and all the carpet. The\r\nnext morning I was summoned before him, and told that what the company\r\nwanted was operators, not experimenters. I was at liberty to take my pay\r\nand get out.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that Edison is a very studious man, an insatiate lover and\r\nreader of books, is well known to his associates; but surprise is often\r\nexpressed at his fund of miscellaneous information. This, it will be\r\nseen, is partly explained by his work for years as a \"press\" reporter.\r\nHe says of this: \"The second time I was in Louisville, they had moved\r\ninto a new office, and the discipline was now good. I took the press\r\njob. In fact, I was a very poor sender, and therefore made the taking\r\nof press report a specialty. The newspaper men allowed me to come over\r\nafter going to press at 3 A.M. and get all the exchanges I wanted. These\r\nI would take home and lay at the foot of my bed. I never slept more than\r\nfour or five hours' so that I would awake at nine or ten and read\r\nthese papers until dinner-time. I thus kept posted, and knew from their\r\nactivity every member of Congress, and what committees they were on; and\r\nall about the topical doings, as well as the prices of breadstuffs\r\nin all the primary markets. I was in a much better position than\r\nmost operators to call on my imagination to supply missing words or\r\nsentences, which were frequent in those days of old, rotten wires, badly\r\ninsulated, especially on stormy nights. Upon such occasions I had to\r\nsupply in some cases one-fifth of the whole matter--pure guessing--but\r\nI got caught only once. There had been some kind of convention in\r\nVirginia, in which John Minor Botts was the leading figure. There\r\nwas great excitement about it, and two votes had been taken in the\r\nconvention on the two days. There was no doubt that the vote the next\r\nday would go a certain way. A very bad storm came up about 10 o'clock,\r\nand my wire worked very badly. Then there was a cessation of all\r\nsignals; then I made out the words 'Minor Botts.' The next was a New\r\nYork item. I filled in a paragraph about the convention and how the vote\r\nhad gone, as I was sure it would. But next day I learned that instead of\r\nthere being a vote the convention had adjourned without action until the\r\nday after.\" In like manner, it was at Louisville that Mr. Edison got\r\nan insight into the manner in which great political speeches are more\r\nfrequently reported than the public suspects. \"The Associated Press\r\nhad a shorthand man travelling with President Johnson when he made his\r\ncelebrated swing around the circle in a private train delivering hot\r\nspeeches in defence of his conduct. The man engaged me to write out\r\nthe notes from his reading. He came in loaded and on the verge of\r\nincoherence. We started in, but about every two minutes I would have to\r\nscratch out whole paragraphs and insert the same things said in\r\nanother and better way. He would frequently change words, always to the\r\nbetterment of the speech. I couldn't understand this, and when he got\r\nthrough, and I had copied about three columns, I asked him why those\r\nchanges, if he read from notes. 'Sonny,' he said, 'if these politicians\r\nhad their speeches published as they deliver them, a great many\r\nshorthand writers would be out of a job. The best shorthanders and the\r\nholders of good positions are those who can take a lot of rambling,\r\nincoherent stuff and make a rattling good speech out of it.'\"\r\n\r\nGoing back to Cincinnati and beginning his second term there as an\r\noperator, Edison found the office in new quarters and with greatly\r\nimproved management. He was again put on night duty, much to his\r\nsatisfaction. He rented a room in the top floor of an office building,\r\nbought a cot and an oil-stove, a foot lathe, and some tools. He\r\ncultivated the acquaintance of Mr. Sommers, superintendent of telegraph\r\nof the Cincinnati & Indianapolis Railroad, who gave him permission to\r\ntake such scrap apparatus as he might desire, that was of no use to the\r\ncompany. With Sommers on one occasion he had an opportunity to indulge\r\nhis always strong sense of humor. \"Sommers was a very witty man,\"\r\nhe says, \"and fond of experimenting. We worked on a self-adjusting\r\ntelegraph relay, which would have been very valuable if we could have\r\ngot it. I soon became the possessor of a second-hand Ruhmkorff induction\r\ncoil, which, although it would only give a small spark, would twist the\r\narms and clutch the hands of a man so that he could not let go of the\r\napparatus. One day we went down to the round-house of the Cincinnati &\r\nIndianapolis Railroad and connected up the long wash-tank in the room\r\nwith the coil, one electrode being connected to earth. Above this\r\nwash-room was a flat roof. We bored a hole through the roof, and could\r\nsee the men as they came in. The first man as he entered dipped his\r\nhands in the water. The floor being wet he formed a circuit, and up went\r\nhis hands. He tried it the second time, with the same result. He then\r\nstood against the wall with a puzzled expression. We surmised that\r\nhe was waiting for somebody else to come in, which occurred shortly\r\nafter--with the same result. Then they went out, and the place was soon\r\ncrowded, and there was considerable excitement. Various theories\r\nwere broached to explain the curious phenomenon. We enjoyed the sport\r\nimmensely.\" It must be remembered that this was over forty years ago,\r\nwhen there was no popular instruction in electricity, and when its\r\npossibilities for practical joking were known to very few. To-day such a\r\ncrowd of working-men would be sure to include at least one student of\r\na night school or correspondence course who would explain the mystery\r\noffhand.\r\n\r\nNote has been made of the presence of Ellsworth in the Cincinnati\r\noffice, and his service with the Confederate guerrilla Morgan, for whom\r\nhe tapped Federal wires, read military messages, sent false ones, and\r\ndid serious mischief generally. It is well known that one operator can\r\nrecognize another by the way in which he makes his signals--it is his\r\nstyle of handwriting. Ellsworth possessed in a remarkable degree the\r\nskill of imitating these peculiarities, and thus he deceived the Union\r\noperators easily. Edison says that while apparently a quiet man in\r\nbearing, Ellsworth, after the excitement of fighting, found the tameness\r\nof a telegraph office obnoxious, and that he became a bad \"gun man\"\r\nin the Panhandle of Texas, where he was killed. \"We soon became\r\nacquainted,\" says Edison of this period in Cincinnati, \"and he wanted me\r\nto invent a secret method of sending despatches so that an intermediate\r\noperator could not tap the wire and understand it. He said that if it\r\ncould be accomplished, he could sell it to the Government for a large\r\nsum of money. This suited me, and I started in and succeeded in making\r\nsuch an instrument, which had in it the germ of my quadruplex now used\r\nthroughout the world, permitting the despatch of four messages over\r\none wire simultaneously. By the time I had succeeded in getting the\r\napparatus to work, Ellsworth suddenly disappeared. Many years afterward\r\nI used this little device again for the same purpose. At Menlo Park, New\r\nJersey, I had my laboratory. There were several Western Union wires cut\r\ninto the laboratory, and used by me in experimenting at night. One day\r\nI sat near an instrument which I had left connected during the night. I\r\nsoon found it was a private wire between New York and Philadelphia, and\r\nI heard among a lot of stuff a message that surprised me. A week after\r\nthat I had occasion to go to New York, and, visiting the office of\r\nthe lessee of the wire, I asked him if he hadn't sent such and such a\r\nmessage. The expression that came over his face was a sight. He asked me\r\nhow I knew of any message. I told him the circumstances, and suggested\r\nthat he had better cipher such communications, or put on a secret\r\nsounder. The result of the interview was that I installed for him my old\r\nCincinnati apparatus, which was used thereafter for many years.\"\r\n\r\nEdison did not make a very long stay in Cincinnati this time, but went\r\nhome after a while to Port Huron. Soon tiring of idleness and isolation\r\nhe sent \"a cry from Macedonia\" to his old friend \"Milt\" Adams, who was\r\nin Boston, and whom he wished to rejoin if he could get work promptly in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nEdison himself gives the details of this eventful move, when he went\r\nEast to grow up with the new art of electricity. \"I had left Louisville\r\nthe second time, and went home to see my parents. After stopping at home\r\nfor some time, I got restless, and thought I would like to work in the\r\nEast. Knowing that a former operator named Adams, who had worked with me\r\nin the Cincinnati office, was in Boston, I wrote him that I wanted a job\r\nthere. He wrote back that if I came on immediately he could get me in\r\nthe Western Union office. I had helped out the Grand Trunk Railroad\r\ntelegraph people by a new device when they lost one of the two submarine\r\ncables they had across the river, making the remaining cable act just as\r\nwell for their purpose, as if they had two. I thought I was entitled\r\nto a pass, which they conceded; and I started for Boston. After leaving\r\nToronto a terrific blizzard came up and the train got snowed under in a\r\ncut. After staying there twenty-four hours, the trainmen made snowshoes\r\nof fence-rail splints and started out to find food, which they did about\r\na half mile away. They found a roadside inn, and by means of snowshoes\r\nall the passengers were taken to the inn. The train reached Montreal\r\nfour days late. A number of the passengers and myself went to the\r\nmilitary headquarters to testify in favor of a soldier who was on\r\nfurlough, and was two days late, which was a serious matter with\r\nmilitary people, I learned. We willingly did this, for this soldier\r\nwas a great story-teller, and made the time pass quickly. I met here a\r\ntelegraph operator named Stanton, who took me to his boarding-house,\r\nthe most cheerless I have ever been in. Nobody got enough to eat; the\r\nbedclothes were too short and too thin; it was 28 degrees below zero,\r\nand the wash-water was frozen solid. The board was cheap, being only\r\n$1.50 per week.\r\n\r\n\"Stanton said that the usual live-stock accompaniment of operators'\r\nboarding-houses was absent; he thought the intense cold had caused\r\nthem to hibernate. Stanton, when I was working in Cincinnati, left his\r\nposition and went out on the Union Pacific to work at Julesburg, which\r\nwas a cattle town at that time and very tough. I remember seeing him off\r\non the train, never expecting to see him again. Six months afterward,\r\nwhile working press wire in Cincinnati, about 2 A.M., there was flung\r\ninto the middle of the operating-room a large tin box. It made a\r\nreport like a pistol, and we all jumped up startled. In walked Stanton.\r\n'Gentlemen,' he said 'I have just returned from a pleasure trip to the\r\nland beyond the Mississippi. All my wealth is contained in my metallic\r\ntravelling case and you are welcome to it.' The case contained one\r\npaper collar. He sat down, and I noticed that he had a woollen comforter\r\naround his neck with his coat buttoned closely. The night was intensely\r\nwarm. He then opened his coat and revealed the fact that he had nothing\r\nbut the bare skin. 'Gentlemen,' said he, 'you see before you an operator\r\nwho has reached the limit of impecuniosity.'\" Not far from the limit of\r\nimpecuniosity was Edison himself, as he landed in Boston in 1868 after\r\nthis wintry ordeal.\r\n\r\nThis chapter has run to undue length, but it must not close without one\r\ncitation from high authority as to the service of the military telegraph\r\ncorps so often referred to in it. General Grant in his Memoirs,\r\ndescribing the movements of the Army of the Potomac, lays stress on the\r\nservice of his telegraph operators, and says: \"Nothing could be more\r\ncomplete than the organization and discipline of this body of brave and\r\nintelligent men. Insulated wires were wound upon reels, two men and a\r\nmule detailed to each reel. The pack-saddle was provided with a rack\r\nlike a sawbuck, placed crosswise, so that the wheel would revolve\r\nfreely; there was a wagon provided with a telegraph operator,\r\nbattery, and instruments for each division corps and army, and for my\r\nheadquarters. Wagons were also loaded with light poles supplied with an\r\niron spike at each end to hold the wires up. The moment troops were in\r\nposition to go into camp, the men would put up their wires. Thus in a\r\nfew minutes' longer time than it took a mule to walk the length of\r\nits coil, telegraphic communication would be effected between all the\r\nheadquarters of the army. No orders ever had to be given to establish\r\nthe telegraph.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWORK AND INVENTION IN BOSTON\r\n\r\nMILTON ADAMS was working in the office of the Franklin Telegraph Company\r\nin Boston when he received Edison's appeal from Port Huron, and with\r\ncharacteristic impetuosity at once made it his business to secure a\r\nposition for his friend. There was no opening in the Franklin office, so\r\nAdams went over to the Western Union office, and asked the manager,\r\nMr. George F. Milliken, if he did not want an operator who, like young\r\nLochinvar, came out of the West. \"What kind of copy does he make?\" was\r\nthe cautious response. \"I passed Edison's letter through the window for\r\nhis inspection. Milliken read it, and a look of surprise came over his\r\ncountenance as he asked me if he could take it off the line like that. I\r\nsaid he certainly could, and that there was nobody who could stick him.\r\nMilliken said that if he was that kind of an operator I could send for\r\nhim, and I wrote to Edison to come on, as I had a job for him in the\r\nmain office of the Western Union.\" Meantime Edison had secured his pass\r\nover the Grand Trunk Railroad, and spent four days and nights on the\r\njourney, suffering extremes of cold and hunger. Franklin's arrival in\r\nPhiladelphia finds its parallel in the very modest debut of Adams's\r\nfriend in Boston.\r\n\r\nIt took only five minutes for Edison to get the \"job,\" for\r\nSuperintendent Milliken, a fine type of telegraph official, saw quickly\r\nthrough the superficialities, and realized that it was no ordinary\r\nyoung operator he was engaging. Edison himself tells the story of what\r\nhappened. \"The manager asked me when I was ready to go to work. 'Now,'\r\nI replied I was then told to return at 5.30 P.M., and punctually at that\r\nhour I entered the main operating-room and was introduced to the night\r\nmanager. The weather being cold, and being clothed poorly, my peculiar\r\nappearance caused much mirth, and, as I afterward learned, the night\r\noperators had consulted together how they might 'put up a job on the jay\r\nfrom the woolly West.' I was given a pen and assigned to the New York\r\nNo. 1 wire. After waiting an hour, I was told to come over to a special\r\ntable and take a special report for the Boston Herald, the conspirators\r\nhaving arranged to have one of the fastest senders in New York send the\r\ndespatch and 'salt' the new man. I sat down unsuspiciously at the table,\r\nand the New York man started slowly. Soon he increased his speed, to\r\nwhich I easily adapted my pace. This put my rival on his mettle, and he\r\nput on his best powers, which, however, were soon reached. At this\r\npoint I happened to look up, and saw the operators all looking over my\r\nshoulder, with their faces shining with fun and excitement. I knew then\r\nthat they were trying to put up a job on me, but kept my own counsel.\r\nThe New York man then commenced to slur over his words, running them\r\ntogether and sticking the signals; but I had been used to this style\r\nof telegraphy in taking report, and was not in the least discomfited.\r\nFinally, when I thought the fun had gone far enough, and having\r\nabout completed the special, I quietly opened the key and remarked,\r\ntelegraphically, to my New York friend: 'Say, young man, change off and\r\nsend with your other foot.' This broke the New York man all up, and he\r\nturned the job over to another man to finish.\"\r\n\r\nEdison had a distaste for taking press report, due to the fact that\r\nit was steady, continuous work, and interfered with the studies and\r\ninvestigations that could be carried on in the intervals of ordinary\r\ncommercial telegraphy. He was not lazy in any sense. While he had no\r\nvery lively interest in the mere routine work of a telegraph office,\r\nhe had the profoundest curiosity as to the underlying principles of\r\nelectricity that made telegraphy possible, and he had an unflagging\r\ndesire and belief in his own ability to improve the apparatus he handled\r\ndaily. The whole intellectual atmosphere of Boston was favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of the brooding genius in this shy, awkward, studious youth,\r\nutterly indifferent to clothes and personal appearance, but ready to\r\nspend his last dollar on books and scientific paraphernalia. It is\r\nmatter of record that he did once buy a new suit for thirty dollars in\r\nBoston, but the following Sunday, while experimenting with acids in his\r\nlittle workshop, the suit was spoiled. \"That is what I get for putting\r\nso much money in a new suit,\" was the laconic remark of the youth, who\r\nwas more than delighted to pick up a complete set of Faraday's works\r\nabout the same time. Adams says that when Edison brought home these\r\nbooks at 4 A.M. he read steadily until breakfast-time, and then he\r\nremarked, enthusiastically: \"Adams, I have got so much to do and life is\r\nso short, I am going to hustle.\" And thereupon he started on a run for\r\nbreakfast. Edison himself says: \"It was in Boston I bought Faraday's\r\nworks. I think I must have tried about everything in those books. His\r\nexplanations were simple. He used no mathematics. He was the Master\r\nExperimenter. I don't think there were many copies of Faraday's works\r\nsold in those days. The only people who did anything in electricity were\r\nthe telegraphers and the opticians making simple school apparatus to\r\ndemonstrate the principles.\" One of these firms was Palmer & Hall, whose\r\ncatalogue of 1850 showed a miniature electric locomotive made by Mr.\r\nThomas Hall, and exhibited in operation the following year at the\r\nCharitable Mechanics' Fair in Boston. In 1852 Mr. Hall made for a Dr.\r\nA. L. Henderson, of Buffalo, New York, a model line of railroad with\r\nelectric-motor engine, telegraph line, and electric railroad signals,\r\ntogether with a figure operating the signals at each end of the line\r\nautomatically. This was in reality the first example of railroad trains\r\nmoved by telegraph signals, a practice now so common and universal as\r\nto attract no comment. To show how little some fundamental methods can\r\nchange in fifty years, it may be noted that Hall conveyed the current\r\nto his tiny car through forty feet of rail, using the rail as conductor,\r\njust as Edison did more than thirty years later in his historic\r\nexperiments for Villard at Menlo Park; and just as a large proportion of\r\nAmerican trolley systems do at this present moment.\r\n\r\nIt was among such practical, investigating folk as these that Edison was\r\nvery much at home. Another notable man of this stamp, with whom Edison\r\nwas thrown in contact, was the late Mr. Charles Williams, who, beginning\r\nhis career in the electrical field in the forties, was at the height of\r\nactivity as a maker of apparatus when Edison arrived in the city; and\r\nwho afterward, as an associate of Alexander Graham Bell, enjoyed the\r\ndistinction of being the first manufacturer in the world of telephones.\r\nAt his Court Street workshop Edison was a frequent visitor. Telegraph\r\nrepairs and experiments were going on constantly, especially on the\r\nearly fire-alarm telegraphs [1] of Farmer and Gamewell, and with the aid\r\nof one of the men there--probably George Anders--Edison worked out\r\ninto an operative model his first invention, a vote-recorder, the first\r\nEdison patent, for which papers were executed on October 11, 1868,\r\nand which was taken out June 1, 1869, No. 90,646. The purpose of\r\nthis particular device was to permit a vote in the National House of\r\nRepresentatives to be taken in a minute or so, complete lists being\r\nfurnished of all members voting on the two sides of any question Mr.\r\nEdison, in recalling the circumstances, says: \"Roberts was the telegraph\r\noperator who was the financial backer to the extent of $100. The\r\ninvention when completed was taken to Washington. I think it was\r\nexhibited before a committee that had something to do with the Capitol.\r\nThe chairman of the committee, after seeing how quickly and perfectly\r\nit worked, said: 'Young man, if there is any invention on earth that\r\nwe don't want down here, it is this. One of the greatest weapons in\r\nthe hands of a minority to prevent bad legislation is filibustering on\r\nvotes, and this instrument would prevent it.' I saw the truth of\r\nthis, because as press operator I had taken miles of Congressional\r\nproceedings, and to this day an enormous amount of time is wasted during\r\neach session of the House in foolishly calling the members' names and\r\nrecording and then adding their votes, when the whole operation could be\r\ndone in almost a moment by merely pressing a particular button at each\r\ndesk. For filibustering purposes, however, the present methods are\r\nmost admirable.\" Edison determined from that time forth to devote his\r\ninventive faculties only to things for which there was a real, genuine\r\ndemand, something that subserved the actual necessities of humanity.\r\nThis first patent was taken out for him by the late Hon. Carroll\r\nD. Wright, afterward U. S. Commissioner of Labor, and a well-known\r\npublicist, then practicing patent law in Boston. He describes Edison as\r\nuncouth in manner, a chewer rather than a smoker of tobacco, but full of\r\nintelligence and ideas.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 1: The general scheme of a fire-alarm telegraph\r\n     system embodies a central office to which notice can be sent\r\n     from any number of signal boxes of the outbreak of a fire in\r\n     the district covered by the box, the central office in turn\r\n     calling out the nearest fire engines, and warning the fire\r\n     department in general of the occurrence. Such fire alarms\r\n     can be exchanged automatically, or by operators, and are\r\n     sometimes associated with a large fire-alarm bell or\r\n     whistle. Some boxes can be operated by the passing public;\r\n     others need special keys. The box mechanism is usually of\r\n     the ratchet, step-by-step movement, familiar in district\r\n     messenger call-boxes.]\r\n\r\nEdison's curiously practical, though imaginative, mind demanded\r\nrealities to work upon, things that belong to \"human nature's daily\r\nfood,\" and he soon harked back to telegraphy, a domain in which he\r\nwas destined to succeed, and over which he was to reign supreme as\r\nan inventor. He did not, however, neglect chemistry, but indulged his\r\ntastes in that direction freely, although we have no record that\r\nthis work was anything more, at that time, than the carrying out of\r\nexperiments outlined in the books. The foundations were being laid for\r\nthe remarkable chemical knowledge that later on grappled successfully\r\nwith so many knotty problems in the realm of chemistry; notably with\r\nthe incandescent lamp and the storage battery. Of one incident in his\r\nchemical experiments he tells the following story: \"I had read in a\r\nscientific paper the method of making nitroglycerine, and was so fired\r\nby the wonderful properties it was said to possess, that I determined\r\nto make some of the compound. We tested what we considered a very small\r\nquantity, but this produced such terrible and unexpected results that we\r\nbecame alarmed, the fact dawning upon us that we had a very large\r\nwhite elephant in our possession. At 6 A.M. I put the explosive into\r\na sarsaparilla bottle, tied a string to it, wrapped it in a paper,\r\nand gently let it down into the sewer, corner of State and Washington\r\nStreets.\" The associate in this was a man whom he had found endeavoring\r\nto make electrical apparatus for sleight-of-hand performances.\r\n\r\nIn the Boston telegraph office at that time, as perhaps at others, there\r\nwere operators studying to enter college; possibly some were already in\r\nattendance at Harvard University. This condition was not unusual at one\r\ntime; the first electrical engineer graduated from Columbia University,\r\nNew York, followed up his studies while a night operator, and came out\r\nbrilliantly at the head of his class. Edison says of these scholars that\r\nthey paraded their knowledge rather freely, and that it was his delight\r\nto go to the second-hand book stores on Cornhill and study up questions\r\nwhich he could spring upon them when he got an occasion. With those\r\nengaged on night duty he got midnight lunch from an old Irishman called\r\n\"the Cake Man,\" who appeared regularly with his wares at 12 midnight.\r\n\"The office was on the ground floor, and had been a restaurant previous\r\nto its occupation by the Western Union Telegraph Company. It was\r\nliterally loaded with cockroaches, which lived between the wall and the\r\nboard running around the room at the floor, and which came after the\r\nlunch. These were such a bother on my table that I pasted two strips\r\nof tinfoil on the wall at my desk, connecting one piece to the positive\r\npole of the big battery supplying current to the wires and the negative\r\npole to the other strip. The cockroaches moving up on the wall would\r\npass over the strips. The moment they got their legs across both strips\r\nthere was a flash of light and the cockroaches went into gas. This\r\nautomatic electrocuting device attracted so much attention, and got half\r\na column in an evening paper, that the manager made me stop it.\" The\r\nreader will remember that a similar plan of campaign against rats was\r\ncarried out by Edison while in the West.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Edison had a narrow escape from injury that might easily\r\nhave shortened his career, and he seems to have provoked the trouble\r\nmore or less innocently by using a little elementary chemistry. \"After\r\nbeing in Boston several months,\" he says, \"working New York wire No.\r\n1, I was requested to work the press wire, called the 'milk route,' as\r\nthere were so many towns on it taking press simultaneously. New\r\nYork office had reported great delays on the wire, due to operators\r\nconstantly interrupting, or 'breaking,' as it was called, to have words\r\nrepeated which they had failed to get; and New York claimed that Boston\r\nwas one of the worst offenders. It was a rather hard position for me,\r\nfor if I took the report without breaking, it would prove the previous\r\nBoston operator incompetent. The results made the operator have some\r\nhard feelings against me. He was put back on the wire, and did much\r\nbetter after that. It seems that the office boy was down on this man.\r\nOne night he asked me if I could tell him how to fix a key so that it\r\nwould not 'break,' even if the circuit-breaker was open, and also so\r\nthat it could not be easily detected. I told him to jab a penful of\r\nink on the platinum points, as there was sugar enough to make it\r\nsufficiently thick to hold up when the operator tried to break--the\r\ncurrent still going through the ink so that he could not break.\r\n\r\n\"The next night about 1 A.M. this operator, on the press wire, while\r\nI was standing near a House printer studying it, pulled out a glass\r\ninsulator, then used upside down as a substitute for an ink-bottle,\r\nand threw it with great violence at me, just missing my head. It would\r\ncertainly have killed me if it had not missed. The cause of the trouble\r\nwas that this operator was doing the best he could not to break, but\r\nbeing compelled to, opened his key and found he couldn't. The press\r\nmatter came right along, and he could not stop it. The office boy had\r\nput the ink in a few minutes before, when the operator had turned his\r\nhead during a lull. He blamed me instinctively as the cause of the\r\ntrouble. Later on we became good friends. He took his meals at the same\r\nemaciator that I did. His main object in life seemed to be acquiring\r\nthe art of throwing up wash-pitchers and catching them without breaking\r\nthem. About one-third of his salary was used up in paying for pitchers.\"\r\n\r\nOne day a request reached the Western Union Telegraph office in Boston,\r\nfrom the principal of a select school for young ladies, to the effect\r\nthat she would like some one to be sent up to the school to exhibit and\r\ndescribe the Morse telegraph to her \"children.\" There has always been\r\na warm interest in Boston in the life and work of Morse, who was born\r\nthere, at Charlestown, barely a mile from the birthplace of Franklin,\r\nand this request for a little lecture on Morse's telegraph was quite\r\nnatural. Edison, who was always ready to earn some extra money for his\r\nexperiments, and was already known as the best-informed operator in the\r\noffice, accepted the invitation. What happened is described by Adams\r\nas follows: \"We gathered up a couple of sounders, a battery, and sonic\r\nwire, and at the appointed time called on her to do the stunt. Her\r\nschool-room was about twenty by twenty feet, not including a small\r\nplatform. We rigged up the line between the two ends of the room, Edison\r\ntaking the stage while I was at the other end of the room. All being\r\nin readiness, the principal was told to bring in her children. The door\r\nopened and in came about twenty young ladies elegantly gowned, not one\r\nof whom was under seventeen. When Edison saw them I thought he would\r\nfaint. He called me on the line and asked me to come to the stage and\r\nexplain the mysteries of the Morse system. I replied that I thought he\r\nwas in the right place, and told him to get busy with his talk on dots\r\nand dashes. Always modest, Edison was so overcome he could hardly speak,\r\nbut he managed to say, finally, that as his friend Mr. Adams was better\r\nequipped with cheek than he was, we would change places, and he would\r\ndo the demonstrating while I explained the whole thing. This caused the\r\nbevy to turn to see where the lecturer was. I went on the stage, said\r\nsomething, and we did some telegraphing over the line. I guess it was\r\nsatisfactory; we got the money, which was the main point to us.\" Edison\r\ntells the story in a similar manner, but insists that it was he who\r\nsaved the situation. \"I managed to say that I would work the apparatus,\r\nand Mr. Adams would make the explanations. Adams was so embarrassed\r\nthat he fell over an ottoman. The girls tittered, and this increased\r\nhis embarrassment until he couldn't say a word. The situation was so\r\ndesperate that for a reason I never could explain I started in myself\r\nand talked and explained better than I ever did before or since. I can\r\ntalk to two or three persons; but when there are more they radiate some\r\nunknown form of influence which paralyzes my vocal cords. However, I got\r\nout of this scrape, and many times afterward when I chanced with other\r\noperators to meet some of the young ladies on their way home from\r\nschool, they would smile and nod, much to the mystification of the\r\noperators, who were ignorant of this episode.\"\r\n\r\nAnother amusing story of this period of impecuniosity and financial\r\nstrain is told thus by Edison: \"My friend Adams was working in the\r\nFranklin Telegraph Company, which competed with the Western Union. Adams\r\nwas laid off, and as his financial resources had reached absolute zero\r\ncentigrade, I undertook to let him sleep in my hall bedroom. I generally\r\nhad hall bedrooms, because they were cheap and I needed money to\r\nbuy apparatus. I also had the pleasure of his genial company at the\r\nboarding-house about a mile distant, but at the sacrifice of some\r\napparatus. One morning, as we were hastening to breakfast, we came\r\ninto Tremont Row, and saw a large crowd in front of two small 'gents'\r\nfurnishing goods stores. We stopped to ascertain the cause of the\r\nexcitement. One store put up a paper sign in the display window which\r\nsaid: 'Three-hundred pairs of stockings received this day, five cents a\r\npair--no connection with the store next door.' Presently the other store\r\nput up a sign stating they had received three hundred pairs, price three\r\ncents per pair, and stated that they had no connection with the store\r\nnext door. Nobody went in. The crowd kept increasing. Finally, when the\r\nprice had reached three pairs for one cent, Adams said to me: 'I can't\r\nstand this any longer; give me a cent.' I gave him a nickel, and he\r\nelbowed his way in; and throwing the money on the counter, the store\r\nbeing filled with women clerks, he said: 'Give me three pairs.' The\r\ncrowd was breathless, and the girl took down a box and drew out three\r\npairs of baby socks. 'Oh!' said Adams, 'I want men's size.' 'Well, sir,\r\nwe do not permit one to pick sizes for that amount of money.' And the\r\ncrowd roared; and this broke up the sales.\"\r\n\r\nIt has generally been supposed that Edison did not take up work on the\r\nstock ticker until after his arrival a little later in New York; but he\r\nsays: \"After the vote-recorder I invented a stock ticker, and started a\r\nticker service in Boston; had thirty or forty subscribers, and operated\r\nfrom a room over the Gold Exchange. This was about a year after Callahan\r\nstarted in New York.\" To say the least, this evidenced great ability\r\nand enterprise on the part of the youth. The dealings in gold during the\r\nCivil War and after its close had brought gold indicators into use, and\r\nthese had soon been followed by \"stock tickers,\" the first of which\r\nwas introduced in New York in 1867. The success of this new but still\r\nprimitively crude class of apparatus was immediate. Four manufacturers\r\nwere soon busy trying to keep pace with the demands for it from brokers;\r\nand the Gold & Stock Telegraph Company formed to exploit the system soon\r\nincreased its capital from $200,000 to $300,000, paying 12 per cent.\r\ndividends on the latter amount. Within its first year the capital was\r\nagain increased to $1,000,000, and dividends of 10 per cent. were paid\r\neasily on that sum also. It is needless to say that such facts became\r\nquickly known among the operators, from whose ranks, of course, the new\r\nemployees were enlisted; and it was a common ambition among the more\r\ningenious to produce a new ticker. From the beginning, each phase\r\nof electrical development--indeed, each step in mechanics--has been\r\naccompanied by the well-known phenomenon of invention; namely, the\r\nattempt of the many to perfect and refine and even re-invent where one\r\nor two daring spirits have led the way. The figures of capitalization\r\nand profit just mentioned were relatively much larger in the sixties\r\nthan they are to-day; and to impressionable young operators they spelled\r\nillimitable wealth. Edison was, how ever, about the only one in Boston\r\nof whom history makes record as achieving any tangible result in this\r\nnew art; and he soon longed for the larger telegraphic opportunity of\r\nNew York. His friend, Milt Adams, went West with quenchless zest for\r\nthat kind of roving life and aimless adventure of which the serious\r\nminded Edison had already had more than enough. Realizing that to New\r\nYork he must look for further support in his efforts, Edison, deep in\r\ndebt for his embryonic inventions, but with high hope and courage,\r\nnow made the next momentous step in his career. He was far riper in\r\nexperience and practice of his art than any other telegrapher of his\r\nage, and had acquired, moreover, no little knowledge of the practical\r\nbusiness of life. Note has been made above of his invention of a stock\r\nticker in Boston, and of his establishing a stock-quotation circuit.\r\nThis was by no means all, and as a fitting close to this chapter he may\r\nbe quoted as to some other work and its perils in experimentation:\r\n\"I also engaged in putting up private lines, upon which I used\r\nan alphabetical dial instrument for telegraphing between business\r\nestablishments, a forerunner of modern telephony. This instrument\r\nwas very simple and practical, and any one could work it after a few\r\nminutes' explanation. I had these instruments made at Mr. Hamblet's, who\r\nhad a little shop where he was engaged in experimenting with electric\r\nclocks. Mr. Hamblet was the father and introducer in after years of the\r\nWestern Union Telegraph system of time distribution. My laboratory was\r\nthe headquarters for the men, and also of tools and supplies for those\r\nprivate lines. They were put up cheaply, as I used the roofs of houses,\r\njust as the Western Union did. It never occurred to me to ask permission\r\nfrom the owners; all we did was to go to the store, etc., say we\r\nwere telegraph men, and wanted to go up to the wires on the roof; and\r\npermission was always granted.\r\n\r\n\"In this laboratory I had a large induction coil which I had borrowed to\r\nmake some experiments with. One day I got hold of both electrodes of\r\nthe coil, and it clinched my hand on them so that I couldn't let go. The\r\nbattery was on a shelf. The only way I could get free was to back off\r\nand pull the coil, so that the battery wires would pull the cells off\r\nthe shelf and thus break the circuit. I shut my eyes and pulled, but the\r\nnitric acid splashed all over my face and ran down my back. I rushed to\r\na sink, which was only half big enough, and got in as well as I could\r\nand wiggled around for several minutes to permit the water to dilute the\r\nacid and stop the pain. My face and back were streaked with yellow; the\r\nskin was thoroughly oxidized. I did not go on the street by daylight for\r\ntwo weeks, as the appearance of my face was dreadful. The skin, however,\r\npeeled off, and new skin replaced it without any damage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE STOCK TICKER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE letters and figures used in the language of the tape,\" said a\r\nwell-known Boston stock speculator, \"are very few, but they spell ruin\r\nin ninety-nine million ways.\" It is not to be inferred, however, that\r\nthe modern stock ticker has anything to do with the making or losing\r\nof fortunes. There were regular daily stock-market reports in London\r\nnewspapers in 1825, and New York soon followed the example. As far back\r\nas 1692, Houghton issued in London a weekly review of financial and\r\ncommercial transactions, upon which Macaulay based the lively narrative\r\nof stock speculation in the seventeenth century, given in his famous\r\nhistory. That which the ubiquitous stock ticker has done is to give\r\ninstantaneity to the news of what the stock market is doing, so that at\r\nevery minute, thousands of miles apart, brokers, investors, and gamblers\r\nmay learn the exact conditions. The existence of such facilities is to\r\nbe admired rather than deplored. News is vital to Wall Street, and there\r\nis no living man on whom the doings in Wall Street are without effect.\r\nThe financial history of the United States and of the world, as shown\r\nby the prices of government bonds and general securities, has been told\r\ndaily for forty years on these narrow strips of paper tape, of which\r\nthousands of miles are run yearly through the \"tickers\" of New York\r\nalone. It is true that the record of the chattering little machine, made\r\nin cabalistic abbreviations on the tape, can drive a man suddenly to the\r\nvery verge of insanity with joy or despair; but if there be blame for\r\nthat, it attaches to the American spirit of speculation and not to\r\nthe ingenious mechanism which reads and registers the beating of the\r\nfinancial pulse.\r\n\r\nEdison came first to New York in 1868, with his early stock printer,\r\nwhich he tried unsuccessfully to sell. He went back to Boston, and quite\r\nundismayed got up a duplex telegraph. \"Toward the end of my stay in\r\nBoston,\" he says, \"I obtained a loan of money, amounting to $800, to\r\nbuild a peculiar kind of duplex telegraph for sending two messages over\r\na single wire simultaneously. The apparatus was built, and I left\r\nthe Western Union employ and went to Rochester, New York, to test the\r\napparatus on the lines of the Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph between that\r\ncity and New York. But the assistant at the other end could not be made\r\nto understand anything, notwithstanding I had written out a very minute\r\ndescription of just what to do. After trying for a week I gave it up and\r\nreturned to New York with but a few cents in my pocket.\" Thus he who\r\nhas never speculated in a stock in his life was destined to make the\r\nbeginnings of his own fortune by providing for others the apparatus\r\nthat should bring to the eye, all over a great city, the momentary\r\nfluctuations of stocks and bonds. No one could have been in direr\r\npoverty than he when the steamboat landed him in New York in 1869. He\r\nwas in debt, and his few belongings in books and instruments had to\r\nbe left behind. He was not far from starving. Mr. W. S. Mallory, an\r\nassociate of many years, quotes directly from him on this point: \"Some\r\nyears ago we had a business negotiation in New York which made it\r\nnecessary for Mr. Edison and me to visit the city five or six times\r\nwithin a comparatively short period. It was our custom to leave Orange\r\nabout 11 A.M., and on arrival in New York to get our lunch before\r\nkeeping the appointments, which were usually made for two o'clock.\r\nSeveral of these lunches were had at Delmonico's, Sherry's, and other\r\nplaces of similar character, but one day, while en route, Mr. Edison\r\nsaid: 'I have been to lunch with you several times; now to-day I am\r\ngoing to take you to lunch with me, and give you the finest lunch you\r\never had.' When we arrived in Hoboken, we took the downtown ferry across\r\nthe Hudson, and when we arrived on the Manhattan side Mr. Edison led the\r\nway to Smith & McNell's, opposite Washington Market, and well known to\r\nold New Yorkers. We went inside and as soon as the waiter appeared\r\nMr. Edison ordered apple dumplings and a cup of coffee for himself. He\r\nconsumed his share of the lunch with the greatest possible pleasure.\r\nThen, as soon as he had finished, he went to the cigar counter and\r\npurchased cigars. As we walked to keep the appointment he gave me the\r\nfollowing reminiscence: When he left Boston and decided to come to New\r\nYork he had only money enough for the trip. After leaving the boat his\r\nfirst thought was of breakfast; but he was without money to obtain it.\r\nHowever, in passing a wholesale tea-house he saw a man tasting tea, so\r\nhe went in and asked the 'taster' if he might have some of the tea. This\r\nthe man gave him, and thus he obtained his first breakfast in New York.\r\nHe knew a telegraph operator here, and on him he depended for a loan to\r\ntide him over until such time as he should secure a position. During the\r\nday he succeeded in locating this operator, but found that he also was\r\nout of a job, and that the best he could do was to loan him one dollar,\r\nwhich he did. This small sum of money represented both food and lodging\r\nuntil such time as work could be obtained. Edison said that as the\r\nresult of the time consumed and the exercise in walking while he found\r\nhis friend, he was extremely hungry, and that he gave most serious\r\nconsideration as to what he should buy in the way of food, and what\r\nparticular kind of food would be most satisfying and filling. The result\r\nwas that at Smith & McNell's he decided on apple dumplings and a cup\r\nof coffee, than which he never ate anything more appetizing. It was not\r\nlong before he was at work and was able to live in a normal manner.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War, with its enormous increase in the national debt\r\nand the volume of paper money, gold had gone to a high premium; and, as\r\never, by its fluctuations in price the value of all other commodities\r\nwas determined. This led to the creation of a \"Gold Room\" in Wall\r\nStreet, where the precious metal could be dealt in; while for dealings\r\nin stocks there also existed the \"Regular Board,\" the \"Open Board,\" and\r\nthe \"Long Room.\" Devoted to one, but the leading object of speculation,\r\nthe \"Gold Room\" was the very focus of all the financial and gambling\r\nactivity of the time, and its quotations governed trade and commerce.\r\nAt first notations in chalk on a blackboard sufficed, but seeing their\r\ninadequacy, Dr. S. S. Laws, vice-president and actual presiding officer\r\nof the Gold Exchange, devised and introduced what was popularly known\r\nas the \"gold indicator.\" This exhibited merely the prevailing price of\r\ngold; but as its quotations changed from instant to instant, it was in\r\na most literal sense \"the cynosure of neighboring eyes.\" One indicator\r\nlooked upon the Gold Room; the other opened toward the street. Within\r\nthe exchange the face could easily be seen high up on the west wall of\r\nthe room, and the machine was operated by Mr. Mersereau, the official\r\nregistrar of the Gold Board.\r\n\r\nDoctor Laws, who afterward became President of the State University of\r\nMissouri, was an inventor of unusual ability and attainments. In\r\nhis early youth he had earned his livelihood in a tool factory; and,\r\napparently with his savings, he went to Princeton, where he studied\r\nelectricity under no less a teacher than the famous Joseph Henry. At the\r\noutbreak of the war in 1861 he was president of one of the Presbyterian\r\nsynodical colleges in the South, whose buildings passed into the hands\r\nof the Government. Going to Europe, he returned to New York in 1863,\r\nand, becoming interested with a relative in financial matters, his\r\nconnection with the Gold Exchange soon followed, when it was organized.\r\nThe indicating mechanism he now devised was electrical, controlled at\r\ncentral by two circuit-closing keys, and was a prototype of all the\r\nlater and modern step-by-step printing telegraphs, upon which the\r\ndistribution of financial news depends. The \"fraction\" drum of the\r\nindicator could be driven in either direction, known as the advance and\r\nretrograde movements, and was divided and marked in eighths. It geared\r\ninto a \"unit\" drum, just as do speed-indicators and cyclometers. Four\r\nelectrical pulsations were required to move the drum the distance\r\nbetween the fractions. The general operation was simple, and in\r\nnormally active times the mechanism and the registrar were equal to all\r\nemergencies. But it is obvious that the record had to be carried away\r\nto the brokers' offices and other places by messengers; and the delay,\r\nconfusion, and mistakes soon suggested to Doctor Laws the desirability\r\nof having a number of indicators at such scattered points, operated by a\r\nmaster transmitter, and dispensing with the regiments of noisy boys.\r\nHe secured this privilege of distribution, and, resigning from the\r\nexchange, devoted his exclusive attention to the \"Gold Reporting\r\nTelegraph,\" which he patented, and for which, at the end of 1866, he had\r\nsecured fifty subscribers. His indicators were small oblong boxes, in\r\nthe front of which was a long slot, allowing the dials as they travelled\r\npast, inside, to show the numerals constituting the quotation; the dials\r\nor wheels being arranged in a row horizontally, overlapping each other,\r\nas in modern fare registers which are now seen on most trolley cars. It\r\nwas not long before there were three hundred subscribers; but the very\r\nsuccess of this device brought competition and improvement. Mr. E. A.\r\nCallahan, an ingenious printing-telegraph operator, saw that there\r\nwere unexhausted possibilities in the idea, and his foresight and\r\ninventiveness made him the father of the \"ticker,\" in connection with\r\nwhich he was thus, like Laws, one of the first to grasp and exploit the\r\nunderlying principle of the \"central station\" as a universal source\r\nof supply. The genesis of his invention Mr. Callahan has told in an\r\ninteresting way: \"In 1867, on the site of the present Mills Building on\r\nBroad Street, opposite the Stock Exchange of today, was an old building\r\nwhich had been cut up to subserve the necessities of its occupants, all\r\nengaged in dealing in gold and stocks. It had one main entrance from the\r\nstreet to a hallway, from which entrance to the offices of two prominent\r\nbroker firms was obtained. Each firm had its own army of boys, numbering\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen, whose duties were to ascertain the latest\r\nquotations from the different exchanges. Each boy devoted his attention\r\nto some particularly active stock. Pushing each other to get into these\r\nnarrow quarters, yelling out the prices at the door, and pushing back\r\nfor later ones, the hustle made this doorway to me a most undesirable\r\nrefuge from an April shower. I was simply whirled into the street.\r\nI naturally thought that much of this noise and confusion might be\r\ndispensed with, and that the prices might be furnished through some\r\nsystem of telegraphy which would not require the employment of skilled\r\noperators. The conception of the stock ticker dates from this incident.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Callahan's first idea was to distribute gold quotations, and to\r\nthis end he devised an \"indicator.\" It consisted of two dials mounted\r\nseparately, each revolved by an electromagnet, so that the desired\r\nfigures were brought to an aperture in the case enclosing the apparatus,\r\nas in the Laws system. Each shaft with its dial was provided with two\r\nratchet wheels, one the reverse of the other. One was used in connection\r\nwith the propelling lever, which was provided with a pawl to fit into\r\nthe teeth of the reversed ratchet wheel on its forward movement. It was\r\nthus made impossible for either dial to go by momentum beyond its limit.\r\nLearning that Doctor Laws, with the skilful aid of F. L. Pope, was\r\nalready active in the same direction, Mr. Callahan, with ready wit,\r\ntransformed his indicator into a \"ticker\" that would make a printed\r\nrecord. The name of the \"ticker\" came through the casual remark of\r\nan observer to whom the noise was the most striking feature of the\r\nmechanism. Mr. Callahan removed the two dials, and, substituting type\r\nwheels, turned the movements face to face, so that each type wheel\r\ncould imprint its characters upon a paper tape in two lines. Three wires\r\nstranded together ran from the central office to each instrument. Of\r\nthese one furnished the current for the alphabet wheel, one for the\r\nfigure wheel, and one for the mechanism that took care of the inking and\r\nprinting on the tape. Callahan made the further innovation of insulating\r\nhis circuit wires, although the cost was then forty times as great as\r\nthat of bare wire. It will be understood that electromagnets were the\r\nticker's actuating agency. The ticker apparatus was placed under a\r\nneat glass shade and mounted on a shelf. Twenty-five instruments were\r\nenergized from one circuit, and the quotations were supplied from a\r\n\"central\" at 18 New Street. The Gold & Stock Telegraph Company was\r\npromptly organized to supply to brokers the system, which was very\r\nrapidly adopted throughout the financial district of New York, at the\r\nsouthern tip of Manhattan Island. Quotations were transmitted by the\r\nMorse telegraph from the floor of the Stock Exchange to the \"central,\"\r\nand thence distributed to the subscribers. Success with the \"stock\" news\r\nsystem was instantaneous.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Edison reached New York, and according to\r\nhis own statement found shelter at night in the battery-room of the Gold\r\nIndicator Company, having meantime applied for a position as operator\r\nwith the Western Union. He had to wait a few days, and during this time\r\nhe seized the opportunity to study the indicators and the complicated\r\ngeneral transmitter in the office, controlled from the keyboard of the\r\noperator on the floor of the Gold Exchange. What happened next has been\r\nthe basis of many inaccurate stories, but is dramatic enough as told\r\nin Mr. Edison's own version: \"On the third day of my arrival and while\r\nsitting in the office, the complicated general instrument for sending\r\non all the lines, and which made a very great noise, suddenly came to\r\na stop with a crash. Within two minutes over three hundred boys--a boy\r\nfrom every broker in the street--rushed up-stairs and crowded the long\r\naisle and office, that hardly had room for one hundred, all yelling that\r\nsuch and such a broker's wire was out of order and to fix it at once.\r\nIt was pandemonium, and the man in charge became so excited that he lost\r\ncontrol of all the knowledge he ever had. I went to the indicator, and,\r\nhaving studied it thoroughly, knew where the trouble ought to be, and\r\nfound it. One of the innumerable contact springs had broken off and had\r\nfallen down between the two gear wheels and stopped the instrument; but\r\nit was not very noticeable. As I went out to tell the man in charge\r\nwhat the matter was, Doctor Laws appeared on the scene, the most excited\r\nperson I had seen. He demanded of the man the cause of the trouble, but\r\nthe man was speechless. I ventured to say that I knew what the trouble\r\nwas, and he said, 'Fix it! Fix it! Be quick!' I removed the spring and\r\nset the contact wheels at zero; and the line, battery, and inspecting\r\nmen all scattered through the financial district to set the instruments.\r\nIn about two hours things were working again. Doctor Laws came in to ask\r\nmy name and what I was doing. I told him, and he asked me to come to his\r\nprivate office the following day. His office was filled with stacks of\r\nbooks all relating to metaphysics and kindred matters. He asked me a\r\ngreat many questions about the instruments and his system, and I showed\r\nhim how he could simplify things generally. He then requested that I\r\nshould call next day. On arrival, he stated at once that he had decided\r\nto put me in charge of the whole plant, and that my salary would be $300\r\nper month! This was such a violent jump from anything I had ever seen\r\nbefore, that it rather paralyzed me for a while, I thought it was too\r\nmuch to be lasting, but I determined to try and live up to that salary\r\nif twenty hours a day of hard work would do it. I kept this position,\r\nmade many improvements, devised several stock tickers, until the Gold &\r\nStock Telegraph Company consolidated with the Gold Indicator Company.\"\r\nCertainly few changes in fortune have been more sudden and dramatic in\r\nany notable career than this which thus placed an ill-clad, unkempt,\r\nhalf-starved, eager lad in a position of such responsibility in days\r\nwhen the fluctuations in the price of gold at every instant meant\r\nfortune or ruin to thousands.\r\n\r\nEdison, barely twenty-one years old, was a keen observer of the stirring\r\nevents around him. \"Wall Street\" is at any time an interesting study,\r\nbut it was never at a more agitated and sensational period of its\r\nhistory than at this time. Edison's arrival in New York coincided\r\nwith an active speculation in gold which may, indeed, be said to have\r\nprovided him with occupation; and was soon followed by the attempt\r\nof Mr. Jay Gould and his associates to corner the gold market,\r\nprecipitating the panic of Black Friday, September 24, 1869. Securing\r\nits import duties in the precious metal and thus assisting to create an\r\nartificial stringency in the gold market, the Government had made it\r\na practice to relieve the situation by selling a million of gold each\r\nmonth. The metal was thus restored to circulation. In some manner,\r\nPresident Grant was persuaded that general conditions and the movement\r\nof the crops would be helped if the sale of gold were suspended for\r\na time; and, this put into effect, he went to visit an old friend in\r\nPennsylvania remote from railroads and telegraphs. The Gould pool had\r\nacquired control of $10,000,000 in gold, and drove the price upward\r\nrapidly from 144 toward their goal of 200. On Black Friday they\r\npurchased another $28,000,000 at 160, and still the price went up. The\r\nfinancial and commercial interests of the country were in panic; but\r\nthe pool persevered in its effort to corner gold, with a profit of many\r\nmillions contingent on success. Yielding to frantic requests, President\r\nGrant, who returned to Washington, caused Secretary Boutwell, of the\r\nTreasury, to throw $4,000,000 of gold into the market. Relief was\r\ninstantaneous, the corner was broken, but the harm had been done.\r\nEdison's remarks shed a vivid side-light on this extraordinary episode:\r\n\"On Black Friday,\" he says, \"we had a very exciting time with the\r\nindicators. The Gould and Fisk crowd had cornered gold, and had run the\r\nquotations up faster than the indicator could follow. The indicator was\r\ncomposed of several wheels; on the circumference of each wheel were the\r\nnumerals; and one wheel had fractions. It worked in the same way as an\r\nordinary counter; one wheel made ten revolutions, and at the tenth\r\nit advanced the adjacent wheel; and this in its turn having gone ten\r\nrevolutions, advanced the next wheel, and so on. On the morning of\r\nBlack Friday the indicator was quoting 150 premium, whereas the bids by\r\nGould's agents in the Gold Room were 165 for five millions or any part.\r\nWe had a paper-weight at the transmitter (to speed it up), and by one\r\no'clock reached the right quotation. The excitement was prodigious. New\r\nStreet, as well as Broad Street, was jammed with excited people. I sat\r\non the top of the Western Union telegraph booth to watch the surging,\r\ncrazy crowd. One man came to the booth, grabbed a pencil, and attempted\r\nto write a message to Boston. The first stroke went clear off the blank;\r\nhe was so excited that he had the operator write the message for him.\r\nAmid great excitement Speyer, the banker, went crazy and it took five\r\nmen to hold him; and everybody lost their head. The Western Union\r\noperator came to me and said: 'Shake, Edison, we are O. K. We haven't\r\ngot a cent.' I felt very happy because we were poor. These occasions are\r\nvery enjoyable to a poor man; but they occur rarely.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a calm sense of detachment about this description that has\r\nbeen possessed by the narrator even in the most anxious moments of his\r\ncareer. He was determined to see all that could be seen, and, quitting\r\nhis perch on the telegraph booth, sought the more secluded headquarters\r\nof the pool forces. \"A friend of mine was an operator who worked in the\r\noffice of Belden & Company, 60 Broadway, which were headquarters for\r\nFisk. Mr. Gould was up-town in the Erie offices in the Grand Opera\r\nHouse. The firm on Broad Street, Smith, Gould & Martin, was the other\r\nbranch. All were connected with wires. Gould seemed to be in charge,\r\nFisk being the executive down-town. Fisk wore a velvet corduroy coat\r\nand a very peculiar vest. He was very chipper, and seemed to be\r\nlight-hearted and happy. Sitting around the room were about a dozen\r\nfine-looking men. All had the complexion of cadavers. There was a basket\r\nof champagne. Hundreds of boys were rushing in paying checks, all checks\r\nbeing payable to Belden & Company. When James Brown, of Brown Brothers\r\n& Company, broke the corner by selling five million gold, all payments\r\nwere repudiated by Smith, Gould & Martin; but they continued to receive\r\nchecks at Belden & Company's for some time, until the Street got wind of\r\nthe game. There was some kind of conspiracy with the Government people\r\nwhich I could not make out, but I heard messages that opened my eyes as\r\nto the ramifications of Wall Street. Gold fell to 132, and it took us\r\nall night to get the indicator back to that quotation. All night long\r\nthe streets were full of people. Every broker's office was brilliantly\r\nlighted all night, and all hands were at work. The clearing-house for\r\ngold had been swamped, and all was mixed up. No one knew if he was\r\nbankrupt or not.\"\r\n\r\nEdison in those days rather liked the modest coffee-shops, and mentions\r\nvisiting one. \"When on the New York No. 1 wire, that I worked in Boston,\r\nthere was an operator named Jerry Borst at the other end. He was a\r\nfirst-class receiver and rapid sender. We made up a scheme to hold this\r\nwire, so he changed one letter of the alphabet and I soon got used\r\nto it; and finally we changed three letters. If any operator tried to\r\nreceive from Borst, he couldn't do it, so Borst and I always worked\r\ntogether. Borst did less talking than any operator I ever knew. Never\r\nhaving seen him, I went while in New York to call upon him. I did all\r\nthe talking. He would listen, stroke his beard, and say nothing. In the\r\nevening I went over to an all-night lunch-house in Printing House Square\r\nin a basement--Oliver's. Night editors, including Horace Greeley, and\r\nHenry Raymond, of the New York Times, took their midnight lunch there.\r\nWhen I went with Borst and another operator, they pointed out two or\r\nthree men who were then celebrated in the newspaper world. The night was\r\nintensely hot and close. After getting our lunch and upon reaching the\r\nsidewalk, Borst opened his mouth, and said: 'That's a great place; a\r\nplate of cakes, a cup of coffee, and a Russian bath, for ten cents.'\r\nThis was about fifty per cent. of his conversation for two days.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of Edison on the gold-indicator had thrown him into close\r\nrelationship with Mr. Franklin L. Pope, the young telegraph engineer\r\nthen associated with Doctor Laws, and afterward a distinguished expert\r\nand technical writer, who became President of the American Institute of\r\nElectrical Engineers in 1886. Each recognized the special ability of\r\nthe other, and barely a week after the famous events of Black Friday the\r\nannouncement of their partnership appeared in the Telegrapher of\r\nOctober 1, 1869. This was the first \"professional card,\" if it may be so\r\ndescribed, ever issued in America by a firm of electrical engineers, and\r\nis here reproduced. It is probable that the advertisement, one of the\r\nlargest in the Telegrapher, and appearing frequently, was not paid for\r\nat full rates, as the publisher, Mr. J. N. Ashley, became a partner in\r\nthe firm, and not altogether a \"sleeping one\" when it came to a division\r\nof profits, which at times were considerable. In order to be nearer his\r\nnew friend Edison boarded with Pope at Elizabeth, New Jersey, for some\r\ntime, living \"the strenuous life\" in the performance of his duties.\r\nAssociated with Pope and Ashley, he followed up his work on telegraph\r\nprinters with marked success. \"While with them I devised a printer\r\nto print gold quotations instead of indicating them. The lines were\r\nstarted, and the whole was sold out to the Gold & Stock Telegraph\r\nCompany. My experimenting was all done in the small shop of a Doctor\r\nBradley, located near the station of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Jersey\r\nCity. Every night I left for Elizabeth on the 1 A.M. train, then walked\r\nhalf a mile to Mr. Pope's house and up at 6 A.M. for breakfast to catch\r\nthe 7 A.M. train. This continued all winter, and many were the occasions\r\nwhen I was nearly frozen in the Elizabeth walk.\" This Doctor Bradley\r\nappears to have been the first in this country to make electrical\r\nmeasurements of precision with the galvanometer, but was an old-school\r\nexperimenter who would work for years on an instrument without\r\ncommercial value. He was also extremely irascible, and when on one\r\noccasion the connecting wire would not come out of one of the binding\r\nposts of a new and costly galvanometer, he jerked the instrument to\r\nthe floor and then jumped on it. He must have been, however, a man of\r\noriginality, as evidenced by his attempt to age whiskey by electricity,\r\nan attempt that has often since been made. \"The hobby he had at the\r\ntime I was there,\" says Edison, \"was the aging of raw whiskey by passing\r\nstrong electric currents through it. He had arranged twenty jars with\r\nplatinum electrodes held in place by hard rubber. When all was ready, he\r\nfilled the cells with whiskey, connected the battery, locked the door of\r\nthe small room in which they were placed, and gave positive orders that\r\nno one should enter. He then disappeared for three days. On the second\r\nday we noticed a terrible smell in the shop, as if from some dead\r\nanimal. The next day the doctor arrived and, noticing the smell, asked\r\nwhat was dead. We all thought something had got into his whiskey-room\r\nand died. He opened it and was nearly overcome. The hard rubber he used\r\nwas, of course, full of sulphur, and this being attacked by the nascent\r\nhydrogen, had produced sulphuretted hydrogen gas in torrents, displacing\r\nall of the air in the room. Sulphuretted hydrogen is, as is well known,\r\nthe gas given off by rotten eggs.\"\r\n\r\nAnother glimpse of this period of development is afforded by an\r\ninteresting article on the stock-reporting telegraph in the Electrical\r\nWorld of March 4, 1899, by Mr. Ralph W. Pope, the well-known Secretary\r\nof the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, who had as a youth an\r\nactive and intimate connection with that branch of electrical industry.\r\nIn the course of his article he mentions the curious fact that Doctor\r\nLaws at first, in receiving quotations from the Exchanges, was so\r\ndistrustful of the Morse system that he installed long lines of\r\nspeaking-tube as a more satisfactory and safe device than a telegraph\r\nwire. As to the relations of that time Mr. Pope remarks: \"The rivalry\r\nbetween the two concerns resulted in consolidation, Doctor Laws's\r\nenterprise being absorbed by the Gold & Stock Telegraph Company, while\r\nthe Laws stock printer was relegated to the scrap-heap and the museum.\r\nCompetition in the field did not, however, cease. Messrs. Pope and\r\nEdison invented a one-wire printer, and started a system of 'gold\r\nprinters' devoted to the recording of gold quotations and sterling\r\nexchange only. It was intended more especially for importers and\r\nexchange brokers, and was furnished at a lower price than the indicator\r\nservice.... The building and equipment of private telegraph lines was\r\nalso entered upon. This business was also subsequently absorbed by the\r\nGold & Stock Telegraph Company, which was probably at this time at the\r\nheight of its prosperity. The financial organization of the company was\r\npeculiar and worthy of attention. Each subscriber for a machine paid\r\nin $100 for the privilege of securing an instrument. For the service\r\nhe paid $25 weekly. In case he retired or failed, he could transfer\r\nhis 'right,' and employees were constantly on the alert for purchasable\r\nrights, which could be disposed of at a profit. It was occasionally\r\nworth the profit to convince a man that he did not actually own the\r\nmachine which had been placed in his office.... The Western Union\r\nTelegraph Company secured a majority of its stock, and Gen. Marshall\r\nLefferts was elected president. A private-line department was\r\nestablished, and the business taken over from Pope, Edison, and Ashley\r\nwas rapidly enlarged.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture General Lefferts, as President of the Gold & Stock\r\nTelegraph Company, requested Edison to go to work on improving the stock\r\nticker, furnishing the money; and the well-known \"Universal\" ticker, in\r\nwide-spread use in its day, was one result. Mr. Edison gives a graphic\r\npicture of the startling effect on his fortunes: \"I made a great many\r\ninventions; one was the special ticker used for many years outside of\r\nNew York in the large cities. This was made exceedingly simple, as\r\nthey did not have the experts we had in New York to handle anything\r\ncomplicated. The same ticker was used on the London Stock Exchange.\r\nAfter I had made a great number of inventions and obtained patents, the\r\nGeneral seemed anxious that the matter should be closed up. One day I\r\nexhibited and worked a successful device whereby if a ticker should get\r\nout of unison in a broker's office and commence to print wild figures,\r\nit could be brought to unison from the central station, which saved the\r\nlabor of many men and much trouble to the broker. He called me into his\r\noffice, and said: 'Now, young man, I want to close up the matter of your\r\ninventions. How much do you think you should receive?' I had made up\r\nmy mind that, taking into consideration the time and killing pace I\r\nwas working at, I should be entitled to $5000, but could get along with\r\n$3000. When the psychological moment arrived, I hadn't the nerve to\r\nname such a large sum, so I said: 'Well, General, suppose you make me an\r\noffer.' Then he said: 'How would $40,000 strike you?' This caused me to\r\ncome as near fainting as I ever got. I was afraid he would hear my heart\r\nbeat. I managed to say that I thought it was fair. 'All right, I will\r\nhave a contract drawn; come around in three days and sign it, and I\r\nwill give you the money.' I arrived on time, but had been doing some\r\nconsiderable thinking on the subject. The sum seemed to be very large\r\nfor the amount of work, for at that time I determined the value by the\r\ntime and trouble, and not by what the invention was worth to others. I\r\nthought there was something unreal about it. However, the contract was\r\nhanded to me. I signed without reading it.\" Edison was then handed the\r\nfirst check he had ever received, one for $40,000 drawn on the Bank of\r\nNew York, at the corner of William and Wall Streets. On going to the\r\nbank and passing in the check at the wicket of the paying teller,\r\nsome brief remarks were made to him, which in his deafness he did not\r\nunderstand. The check was handed back to him, and Edison, fancying for a\r\nmoment that in some way he had been cheated, went outside \"to the\r\nlarge steps to let the cold sweat evaporate.\" He then went back to the\r\nGeneral, who, with his secretary, had a good laugh over the matter,\r\ntold him the check must be endorsed, and sent with him a young man to\r\nidentify him. The ceremony of identification performed with the paying\r\nteller, who was quite merry over the incident, Edison was given the\r\namount in bundles of small bills \"until there certainly seemed to be one\r\ncubic foot.\" Unaware that he was the victim of a practical joke, Edison\r\nproceeded gravely to stow away the money in his overcoat pockets and all\r\nhis other pockets. He then went to Newark and sat up all night with\r\nthe money for fear it might be stolen. Once more he sought help next\r\nmorning, when the General laughed heartily, and, telling the clerk that\r\nthe joke must not be carried any further, enabled him to deposit the\r\ncurrency in the bank and open an account.\r\n\r\nThus in an inconceivably brief time had Edison passed from poverty to\r\nindependence; made a deep impression as to his originality and ability\r\non important people, and brought out valuable inventions; lifting\r\nhimself at one bound out of the ruck of mediocrity, and away from the\r\ndeadening drudgery of the key. Best of all he was enterprising, one of\r\nthe leaders and pioneers for whom the world is always looking; and, to\r\nuse his own criticism of himself, he had \"too sanguine a temperament\r\nto keep money in solitary confinement.\" With quiet self-possession he\r\nseized his opportunity, began to buy machinery, rented a shop and got\r\nwork for it. Moving quickly into a larger shop, Nos. 10 and 12 Ward\r\nStreet, Newark, New Jersey, he secured large orders from General\r\nLefferts to build stock tickers, and employed fifty men. As business\r\nincreased he put on a night force, and was his own foreman on both\r\nshifts. Half an hour of sleep three or four times in the twenty-four\r\nhours was all he needed in those days, when one invention succeeded\r\nanother with dazzling rapidity, and when he worked with the fierce,\r\neruptive energy of a great volcano, throwing out new ideas incessantly\r\nwith spectacular effect on the arts to which they related. It has always\r\nbeen a theory with Edison that we sleep altogether too much; but on\r\nthe other hand he never, until long past fifty, knew or practiced the\r\nslightest moderation in work or in the use of strong coffee and black\r\ncigars. He has, moreover, while of tender and kindly disposition, never\r\nhesitated to use men up as freely as a Napoleon or Grant; seeing only\r\nthe goal of a complete invention or perfected device, to attain which\r\nall else must become subsidiary. He gives a graphic picture of his first\r\nmethods as a manufacturer: \"Nearly all my men were on piece work, and\r\nI allowed them to make good wages, and never cut until the pay became\r\nabsurdly high as they got more expert. I kept no books. I had two hooks.\r\nAll the bills and accounts I owed I jabbed on one hook; and memoranda of\r\nall owed to myself I put on the other. When some of the bills fell due,\r\nand I couldn't deliver tickers to get a supply of money, I gave a note.\r\nWhen the notes were due, a messenger came around from the bank with the\r\nnote and a protest pinned to it for $1.25. Then I would go to New York\r\nand get an advance, or pay the note if I had the money. This method of\r\ngiving notes for my accounts and having all notes protested I kept up\r\nover two years, yet my credit was fine. Every store I traded with was\r\nalways glad to furnish goods, perhaps in amazed admiration of my system\r\nof doing business, which was certainly new.\" After a while Edison got\r\na bookkeeper, whose vagaries made him look back with regret on the\r\nearlier, primitive method. \"The first three months I had him go over\r\nthe books to find out how much we had made. He reported $3000. I gave\r\na supper to some of my men to celebrate this, only to be told two days\r\nafterward that he had made a mistake, and that we had lost $500; and\r\nthen a few days after that he came to me again and said he was all\r\nmixed up, and now found that we had made over $7000.\" Edison changed\r\nbookkeepers, but never thereafter counted anything real profit until he\r\nhad paid all his debts and had the profits in the bank.\r\n\r\nThe factory work at this time related chiefly to stock tickers,\r\nprincipally the \"Universal,\" of which at one time twelve hundred were\r\nin use. Edison's connection with this particular device was very close\r\nwhile it lasted. In a review of the ticker art, Mr. Callahan stated,\r\nwith rather grudging praise, that \"a ticker at the present time (1901)\r\nwould be considered as impracticable and unsalable if it were not\r\nprovided with a unison device,\" and he goes on to remark: \"The first\r\nunison on stock tickers was one used on the Laws printer. [2] It was a\r\ncrude and unsatisfactory piece of mechanism and necessitated doubling\r\nof the battery in order to bring it into action. It was short-lived. The\r\nEdison unison comprised a lever with a free end travelling in a spiral\r\nor worm on the type-wheel shaft until it met a pin at the end of the\r\nworm, thus obstructing the shaft and leaving the type-wheels at the\r\nzero-point until released by the printing lever. This device is too\r\nwell known to require a further description. It is not applicable to any\r\ninstrument using two independently moving type-wheels; but on nearly if\r\nnot all other instruments will be found in use.\" The stock ticker has\r\nenjoyed the devotion of many brilliant inventors--G. M. Phelps, H. Van\r\nHoevenbergh, A. A. Knudson, G. B. Scott, S. D. Field, John Burry--and\r\nremains in extensive use as an appliance for which no substitute or\r\ncompetitor has been found. In New York the two great stock exchanges\r\nhave deemed it necessary to own and operate a stock-ticker service for\r\nthe sole benefit of their members; and down to the present moment the\r\nprocess of improvement has gone on, impelled by the increasing volume of\r\nbusiness to be reported. It is significant of Edison's work, now dimmed\r\nand overlaid by later advances, that at the very outset he recognized\r\nthe vital importance of interchangeability in the construction of this\r\ndelicate and sensitive apparatus. But the difficulties of these early\r\ndays were almost insurmountable. Mr. R. W. Pope says of the \"Universal\"\r\nmachines that they were simple and substantial and generally\r\nsatisfactory, but adds: \"These instruments were supposed to have been\r\nmade with interchangeable parts; but as a matter of fact the instances\r\nin which these parts would fit were very few. The instruction-book\r\nprepared for the use of inspectors stated that 'The parts should not be\r\ntinkered nor bent, as they are accurately made and interchangeable.' The\r\ndifficulties encountered in fitting them properly doubtless gave rise\r\nto a story that Mr. Edison had stated that there were three degrees of\r\ninterchangeability. This was interpreted to mean: First, the parts will\r\nfit; second, they will almost fit; third, they do not fit, and can't be\r\nmade to fit.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 2: This I invented as well.--T. A. E.]\r\n\r\nThis early shop affords an illustration of the manner in which Edison\r\nhas made a deep impression on the personnel of the electrical arts. At\r\na single bench there worked three men since rich or prominent. One\r\nwas Sigmund Bergmann, for a time partner with Edison in his lighting\r\ndevelopments in the United States, and now head and principal owner\r\nof electrical works in Berlin employing ten thousand men. The next\r\nman adjacent was John Kruesi, afterward engineer of the great General\r\nElectric Works at Schenectady. A third was Schuckert, who left the bench\r\nto settle up his father's little estate at Nuremberg, stayed there and\r\nfounded electrical factories, which became the third largest in Germany,\r\ntheir proprietor dying very wealthy. \"I gave them a good training as\r\nto working hours and hustling,\" says their quondam master; and this is\r\nequally true as applied to many scores of others working in companies\r\nbearing the Edison name or organized under Edison patents. It is\r\ncuriously significant in this connection that of the twenty-one\r\npresidents of the national society, the American Institute of Electrical\r\nEngineers, founded in 1884, eight have been intimately associated with\r\nEdison--namely, Norvin Green and F. L. Pope, as business colleagues of\r\nthe days of which we now write; while Messrs. Frank J. Sprague, T. C.\r\nMartin, A. E. Kennelly, S. S. Wheeler, John W. Lieb, Jr., and Louis A.\r\nFerguson have all been at one time or another in the Edison employ. The\r\nremark was once made that if a famous American teacher sat at one end\r\nof a log and a student at the other end, the elements of a successful\r\nuniversity were present. It is equally true that in Edison and the many\r\nmen who have graduated from his stern school of endeavor, America has\r\nhad its foremost seat of electrical engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC, DUPLEX, AND QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY\r\n\r\nWORK of various kinds poured in upon the young manufacturer, busy also\r\nwith his own schemes and inventions, which soon began to follow so many\r\ndistinct lines of inquiry that it ceases to be easy or necessary for the\r\nhistorian to treat them all in chronological sequence. Some notion of\r\nhis ceaseless activity may be formed from the fact that he started no\r\nfewer than three shops in Newark during 1870-71, and while directing\r\nthese was also engaged by the men who controlled the Automatic Telegraph\r\nCompany of New York, which had a circuit to Washington, to help it out\r\nof its difficulties. \"Soon after starting the large shop (10 and 12 Ward\r\nStreet, Newark), I rented shop-room to the inventor of a new rifle.\r\nI think it was the Berdan. In any event, it was a rifle which was\r\nsubsequently adopted by the British Army. The inventor employed a\r\ntool-maker who was the finest and best tool-maker I had ever seen. I\r\nnoticed that he worked pretty near the whole of the twenty-four hours.\r\nThis kind of application I was looking for. He was getting $21.50 per\r\nweek, and was also paid for overtime. I asked him if he could run the\r\nshop. 'I don't know; try me!' he said. 'All right, I will give you $60\r\nper week to run both shifts.' He went at it. His executive ability\r\nwas greater than that of any other man I have yet seen. His memory was\r\nprodigious, conversation laconic, and movements rapid. He doubled\r\nthe production inside three months, without materially increasing the\r\npay-roll, by increasing the cutting speeds of tools, and by the use of\r\nvarious devices. When in need of rest he would lie down on a work-bench,\r\nsleep twenty or thirty minutes, and wake up fresh. As this was just what\r\nI could do, I naturally conceived a great pride in having such a man in\r\ncharge of my work. But almost everything has trouble connected with it.\r\nHe disappeared one day, and although I sent men everywhere that it was\r\nlikely he could be found, he was not discovered. After two weeks he came\r\ninto the factory in a terrible condition as to clothes and face. He sat\r\ndown and, turning to me, said: 'Edison, it's no use, this is the third\r\ntime; I can't stand prosperity. Put my salary back and give me a job.' I\r\nwas very sorry to learn that it was whiskey that spoiled such a career.\r\nI gave him an inferior job and kept him for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nEdison had now entered definitely upon that career as an inventor which\r\nhas left so deep an imprint on the records of the United States Patent\r\nOffice, where from his first patent in 1869 up to the summer of 1910\r\nno fewer than 1328 separate patents have been applied for in his name,\r\naveraging thirty-two every year, and one about every eleven days; with a\r\nsubstantially corresponding number issued. The height of this inventive\r\nactivity was attained about 1882, in which year no fewer than 141\r\npatents were applied for, and seventy-five granted to him, or nearly\r\nnine times as many as in 1876, when invention as a profession may\r\nbe said to have been adopted by this prolific genius. It will be\r\nunderstood, of course, that even these figures do not represent the full\r\nmeasure of actual invention, as in every process and at every step there\r\nwere many discoveries that were not brought to patent registration, but\r\nremained \"trade secrets.\" And furthermore, that in practically every\r\ncase the actual patented invention followed from one to a dozen or more\r\ngradually developing forms of the same idea.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman named George Little had brought over a system of automatic\r\ntelegraphy which worked well on a short line, but was a failure when put\r\nupon the longer circuits for which automatic methods are best adapted.\r\nThe general principle involved in automatic or rapid telegraphs, except\r\nthe photographic ones, is that of preparing the message in advance, for\r\ndispatch, by perforating narrow strips of paper with holes--work which\r\ncan be done either by hand-punches or by typewriter apparatus. A certain\r\ngroup of perforations corresponds to a Morse group of dots and dashes\r\nfor a letter of the alphabet. When the tape thus made ready is run\r\nrapidly through a transmitting machine, electrical contact occurs\r\nwherever there is a perforation, permitting the current from the battery\r\nto flow into the line and thus transmit signals correspondingly. At\r\nthe distant end these signals are received sometimes on an ink-writing\r\nrecorder as dots and dashes, or even as typewriting letters; but in\r\nmany of the earlier systems, like that of Bain, the record at the higher\r\nrates of speed was effected by chemical means, a tell-tale stain\r\nbeing made on the travelling strip of paper by every spurt of incoming\r\ncurrent. Solutions of potassium iodide were frequently used for this\r\npurpose, giving a sharp, blue record, but fading away too rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe Little system had perforating apparatus operated by electromagnets;\r\nits transmitting machine was driven by a small electromagnetic motor;\r\nand the record was made by electrochemical decomposition, the writing\r\nmember being a minute platinum roller instead of the more familiar iron\r\nstylus. Moreover, a special type of wire had been put up for the single\r\ncircuit of two hundred and eighty miles between New York and Washington.\r\nThis is believed to have been the first \"compound\" wire made for\r\ntelegraphic or other signalling purposes, the object being to secure\r\ngreater lightness with textile strength and high conductivity. It had a\r\nsteel core, with a copper ribbon wound spirally around it, and tinned\r\nto the core wire. But the results obtained were poor, and in their\r\nnecessity the parties in interest turned to Edison.\r\n\r\nMr. E. H. Johnson tells of the conditions: \"Gen. W. J. Palmer and some\r\nNew York associates had taken up the Little automatic system and had\r\nexpended quite a sum in its development, when, thinking they had reduced\r\nit to practice, they got Tom Scott, of the Pennsylvania Railroad to send\r\nhis superintendent of telegraph over to look into and report upon it. Of\r\ncourse he turned it down. The syndicate was appalled at this report, and\r\nin this extremity General Palmer thought of the man who had impressed\r\nhim as knowing it all by the telling of telegraphic tales as a means of\r\nwhiling away lonesome hours on the plains of Colorado, where they were\r\nassociated in railroad-building. So this man--it was I--was sent for to\r\ncome to New York and assuage their grief if possible. My report was that\r\nthe system was sound fundamentally, that it contained the germ of a good\r\nthing, but needed working out. Associated with General Palmer was one\r\nCol. Josiah C. Reiff, then Eastern bond agent for the Kansas Pacific\r\nRailroad. The Colonel was always resourceful, and didn't fail in\r\nthis case. He knew of a young fellow who was doing some good work for\r\nMarshall Lefferts, and who it was said was a genius at invention, and\r\na very fiend for work. His name was Edison, and he had a shop out at\r\nNewark, New Jersey. He came and was put in my care for the purpose of a\r\nmutual exchange of ideas and for a report by me as to his competency in\r\nthe matter. This was my introduction to Edison. He confirmed my views\r\nof the automatic system. He saw its possibilities, as well as the chief\r\nobstacles to be overcome--viz., the sluggishness of the wire, together\r\nwith the need of mechanical betterment of the apparatus; and he agreed\r\nto take the job on one condition--namely, that Johnson would stay and\r\nhelp, as 'he was a man with ideas.' Mr. Johnson was accordingly given\r\nthree months' leave from Colorado railroad-building, and has never seen\r\nColorado since.\"\r\n\r\nApplying himself to the difficulties with wonted energy, Edison devised\r\nnew apparatus, and solved the problem to such an extent that he and his\r\nassistants succeeded in transmitting and recording one thousand words\r\nper minute between New York and Washington, and thirty-five hundred\r\nwords per minute to Philadelphia. Ordinary manual transmission by key\r\nis not in excess of forty to fifty words a minute. Stated very briefly,\r\nEdison's principal contribution to the commercial development of the\r\nautomatic was based on the observation that in a line of considerable\r\nlength electrical impulses become enormously extended, or sluggish, due\r\nto a phenomenon known as self-induction, which with ordinary Morse work\r\nis in a measure corrected by condensers. But in the automatic the aim\r\nwas to deal with impulses following each other from twenty-five to one\r\nhundred times as rapidly as in Morse lines, and to attempt to receive\r\nand record intelligibly such a lightning-like succession of signals\r\nwould have seemed impossible. But Edison discovered that by utilizing\r\na shunt around the receiving instrument, with a soft iron core, the\r\nself-induction would produce a momentary and instantaneous reversal of\r\nthe current at the end of each impulse, and thereby give an absolutely\r\nsharp definition to each signal. This discovery did away entirely with\r\nsluggishness, and made it possible to secure high speeds over lines of\r\ncomparatively great lengths. But Edison's work on the automatic did\r\nnot stop with this basic suggestion, for he took up and perfected the\r\nmechanical construction of the instruments, as well as the perforators,\r\nand also suggested numerous electrosensitive chemicals for the\r\nreceivers, so that the automatic telegraph, almost entirely by reason of\r\nhis individual work, was placed on a plane of commercial practicability.\r\nThe long line of patents secured by him in this art is an interesting\r\nexhibit of the development of a germ to a completed system, not, as\r\nis usually the case, by numerous inventors working over considerable\r\nperiods of time, but by one man evolving the successive steps at a white\r\nheat of activity.\r\n\r\nThis system was put in commercial operation, but the company, now\r\nencouraged, was quite willing to allow Edison to work out his idea of an\r\nautomatic that would print the message in bold Roman letters instead\r\nof in dots and dashes; with consequent gain in speed in delivery of\r\nthe message after its receipt in the operating-room, it being obviously\r\nnecessary in the case of any message received in Morse characters to\r\ncopy it in script before delivery to the recipient. A large shop was\r\nrented in Newark, equipped with $25,000 worth of machinery, and Edison\r\nwas given full charge. Here he built their original type of apparatus,\r\nas improved, and also pushed his experiments on the letter system so far\r\nthat at a test, between New York and Philadelphia, three thousand words\r\nwere sent in one minute and recorded in Roman type. Mr. D. N. Craig, one\r\nof the early organizers of the Associated Press, became interested\r\nin this company, whose president was Mr. George Harrington, formerly\r\nAssistant Secretary of the United States Treasury.\r\n\r\nMr. Craig brought with him at this time--the early seventies--from\r\nMilwaukee a Mr. Sholes, who had a wooden model of a machine to which had\r\nbeen given the then new and unfamiliar name of \"typewriter.\" Craig\r\nwas interested in the machine, and put the model in Edison's hands to\r\nperfect. \"This typewriter proved a difficult thing,\" says Edison, \"to\r\nmake commercial. The alignment of the letters was awful. One letter\r\nwould be one-sixteenth of an inch above the others; and all the letters\r\nwanted to wander out of line. I worked on it till the machine gave\r\nfair results. [3] Some were made and used in the office of the Automatic\r\ncompany. Craig was very sanguine that some day all business letters\r\nwould be written on a typewriter. He died before that took place; but\r\nit gradually made its way. The typewriter I got into commercial shape is\r\nnow known as the Remington. About this time I got an idea I could devise\r\nan apparatus by which four messages could simultaneously be sent over a\r\nsingle wire without interfering with each other. I now had five shops,\r\nand with experimenting on this new scheme I was pretty busy; at least I\r\ndid not have ennui.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 3: See illustration on opposite page, showing\r\n     reproduction of the work done with this machine.]\r\n\r\nA very interesting picture of Mr. Edison at this time is furnished by\r\nMr. Patrick B. Delany, a well-known inventor in the field of automatic\r\nand multiplex telegraphy, who at that time was a chief operator of the\r\nFranklin Telegraph Company at Philadelphia. His remark about Edison that\r\n\"his ingenuity inspired confidence, and wavering financiers stiffened\r\nup when it became known that he was to develop the automatic\" is a\r\nnoteworthy evidence of the manner in which the young inventor had\r\nalready gained a firm footing. He continues: \"Edward H. Johnson was\r\nbrought on from the Denver & Rio Grande Railway to assist in the\r\npractical introduction of automatic telegraphy on a commercial basis,\r\nand about this time, in 1872, I joined the enterprise. Fairly good\r\nresults were obtained between New York and Washington, and Edison,\r\nindifferent to theoretical difficulties, set out to prove high speeds\r\nbetween New York and Charleston, South Carolina, the compound wire being\r\nhitched up to one of the Southern & Atlantic wires from Washington to\r\nCharleston for the purpose of experimentation. Johnson and I went to the\r\nCharleston end to carry out Edison's plans, which were rapidly unfolded\r\nby telegraph every night from a loft on lower Broadway, New York. We\r\ncould only get the wire after all business was cleared, usually about\r\nmidnight, and for months, in the quiet hours, that wire was subjected\r\nto more electrical acrobatics than any other wire ever experienced. When\r\nthe experiments ended, Edison's system was put into regular commercial\r\noperation between New York and Washington; and did fine work. If the\r\nsingle wire had not broken about every other day, the venture would have\r\nbeen a financial success; but moisture got in between the copper ribbon\r\nand the steel core, setting up galvanic action which made short work of\r\nthe steel. The demonstration was, however, sufficiently successful to\r\nimpel Jay Gould to contract to pay about $4,000,000 in stock for the\r\npatents. The contract was never completed so far as the $4,000,000\r\nwere concerned, but Gould made good use of it in getting control of the\r\nWestern Union.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most important persons connected with the automatic\r\nenterprise was Mr. George Harrington, to whom we have above referred,\r\nand with whom Mr. Edison entered into close confidential relations, so\r\nthat the inventions made were held jointly, under a partnership deed\r\ncovering \"any inventions or improvements that may be useful or desired\r\nin automatic telegraphy.\" Mr. Harrington was assured at the outset by\r\nEdison that while the Little perforator would give on the average only\r\nseven or eight words per minute, which was not enough for commercial\r\npurposes, he could devise one giving fifty or sixty words, and that\r\nwhile the Little solution for the receiving tape cost $15 to $17 per\r\ngallon, he could furnish a ferric solution costing only five or six\r\ncents per gallon. In every respect Edison \"made good,\" and in a short\r\ntime the system was a success, \"Mr. Little having withdrawn his obsolete\r\nperforator, his ineffective resistance, his costly chemical solution, to\r\ngive place to Edison's perforator, Edison's resistance and devices, and\r\nEdison's solution costing a few cents per gallon. But,\" continues Mr.\r\nHarrington, in a memorable affidavit, \"the inventive efforts of Mr.\r\nEdison were not confined to automatic telegraphy, nor did they cease\r\nwith the opening of that line to Washington.\" They all led up to the\r\nquadruplex.\r\n\r\nFlattered by their success, Messrs. Harrington and Reiff, who owned with\r\nEdison the foreign patents for the new automatic system, entered into an\r\narrangement with the British postal telegraph authorities for a trial\r\nof the system in England, involving its probable adoption if successful.\r\nEdison was sent to England to make the demonstration, in 1873, reporting\r\nthere to Col. George E. Gouraud, who had been an associate in the United\r\nStates Treasury with Mr. Harrington, and was now connected with the\r\nnew enterprise. With one small satchel of clothes, three large boxes of\r\ninstruments, and a bright fellow-telegrapher named Jack Wright, he took\r\nvoyage on the Jumping Java, as she was humorously known, of the Cunard\r\nline. The voyage was rough and the little Java justified her reputation\r\nby jumping all over the ocean. \"At the table,\" says Edison, \"there were\r\nnever more than ten or twelve people. I wondered at the time how it\r\ncould pay to run an ocean steamer with so few people; but when we got\r\ninto calm water and could see the green fields, I was astounded to see\r\nthe number of people who appeared. There were certainly two or three\r\nhundred. I learned afterward that they were mostly going to the Vienna\r\nExposition. Only two days could I get on deck, and on one of these a\r\ngentleman had a bad scalp wound from being thrown against the iron wall\r\nof a small smoking-room erected over a freight hatch.\"\r\n\r\nArrived in London, Edison set up his apparatus at the Telegraph Street\r\nheadquarters, and sent his companion to Liverpool with the instruments\r\nfor that end. The condition of the test was that he was to send from\r\nLiverpool and receive in London, and to record at the rate of one\r\nthousand words per minute, five hundred words to be sent every half hour\r\nfor six hours. Edison was given a wire and batteries to operate with,\r\nbut a preliminary test soon showed that he was going to fail. Both wire\r\nand batteries were poor, and one of the men detailed by the authorities\r\nto watch the test remarked quietly, in a friendly way: \"You are not\r\ngoing to have much show. They are going to give you an old Bridgewater\r\nCanal wire that is so poor we don't work it, and a lot of 'sand\r\nbatteries' at Liverpool.\" [4] The situation was rather depressing to\r\nthe young American thus encountering, for the first time, the stolid\r\nconservatism and opposition to change that characterizes so much of\r\nofficial life and methods in Europe. \"I thanked him,\" says Edison, \"and\r\nhoped to reciprocate somehow. I knew I was in a hole. I had been staying\r\nat a little hotel in Covent Garden called the Hummums! and got nothing\r\nbut roast beef and flounders, and my imagination was getting into a\r\ncoma. What I needed was pastry. That night I found a French pastry shop\r\nin High Holborn Street and filled up. My imagination got all right.\r\nEarly in the morning I saw Gouraud, stated my case, and asked if he\r\nwould stand for the purchase of a powerful battery to send to Liverpool.\r\nHe said 'Yes.' I went immediately to Apps on the Strand and asked if\r\nhe had a powerful battery. He said he hadn't; that all that he had was\r\nTyndall's Royal Institution battery, which he supposed would not\r\nserve. I saw it--one hundred cells--and getting the price--one hundred\r\nguineas--hurried to Gouraud. He said 'Go ahead.' I telegraphed to the\r\nman in Liverpool. He came on, got the battery to Liverpool, set up and\r\nready, just two hours before the test commenced. One of the principal\r\nthings that made the system a success was that the line was put to earth\r\nat the sending end through a magnet, and the extra current from this,\r\npassed to the line, served to sharpen the recording waves. This new\r\nbattery was strong enough to pass a powerful current through the magnet\r\nwithout materially diminishing the strength of the line current.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 4: The sand battery is now obsolete. In this type,\r\n     the cell containing the elements was filled with sand, which\r\n     was kept moist with an electrolyte.]\r\n\r\nThe test under these more favorable circumstances was a success. \"The\r\nrecord was as perfect as copper plate, and not a single remark was made\r\nin the 'time lost' column.\" Edison was now asked if he thought he could\r\nget a greater speed through submarine cables with this system than with\r\nthe regular methods, and replied that he would like a chance to try\r\nit. For this purpose, twenty-two hundred miles of Brazilian cable then\r\nstored under water in tanks at the Greenwich works of the Telegraph\r\nConstruction & Maintenance Company, near London, was placed at his\r\ndisposal from 8 P.M. until 6 A.M. \"This just suited me, as I preferred\r\nnight-work. I got my apparatus down and set up, and then to get a\r\npreliminary idea of what the distortion of the signal would be, I sent a\r\nsingle dot, which should have been recorded upon my automatic paper by\r\na mark about one-thirty-second of an inch long. Instead of that it was\r\ntwenty-seven feet long! If I ever had any conceit, it vanished from my\r\nboots up. I worked on this cable more than two weeks, and the best I\r\ncould do was two words per minute, which was only one-seventh of what\r\nthe guaranteed speed of the cable should be when laid. What I did\r\nnot know at the time was that a coiled cable, owing to induction, was\r\ninfinitely worse than when laid out straight, and that my speed was as\r\ngood as, if not better than, with the regular system; but no one told me\r\nthis.\" While he was engaged on these tests Colonel Gouraud came down\r\none night to visit him at the lonely works, spent a vigil with him, and\r\ntoward morning wanted coffee. There was only one little inn near\r\nby, frequented by longshoremen and employees from the soap-works and\r\ncement-factories--a rough lot--and there at daybreak they went as soon\r\nas the other customers had left for work. \"The place had a bar and six\r\nbare tables, and was simply infested with roaches. The only things\r\nthat I ever could get were coffee made from burnt bread, with brown\r\nmolasses-cake. I ordered these for Gouraud. The taste of the coffee, the\r\ninsects, etc., were too much. He fainted. I gave him a big dose of gin,\r\nand this revived him. He went back to the works and waited until six\r\nwhen the day men came, and telegraphed for a carriage. He lost all\r\ninterest in the experiments after that, and I was ordered back to\r\nAmerica.\" Edison states, however, that the automatic was finally adopted\r\nin England and used for many years; indeed, is still in use there. But\r\nthey took whatever was needed from his system, and he \"has never had a\r\ncent from them.\"\r\n\r\nArduous work was at once resumed at home on duplex and quadruplex\r\ntelegraphy, just as though there had been no intermission or\r\ndiscouragement over dots twenty-seven feet long. A clue to his activity\r\nis furnished in the fact that in 1872 he had applied for thirty-eight\r\npatents in the class of telegraphy, and twenty-five in 1873; several\r\nof these being for duplex methods, on which he had experimented. The\r\nearlier apparatus had been built several years prior to this, as shown\r\nby a curious little item of news that appeared in the Telegrapher\r\nof January 30, 1869: \"T. A. Edison has resigned his situation in the\r\nWestern Union office, Boston, and will devote his time to bringing out\r\nhis inventions.\" Oh, the supreme, splendid confidence of youth! Six\r\nmonths later, as we have seen, he had already made his mark, and the\r\nsame journal, in October, 1869, could say: \"Mr. Edison is a young man\r\nof the highest order of mechanical talent, combined with good scientific\r\nelectrical knowledge and experience. He has already invented and\r\npatented a number of valuable and useful inventions, among which may be\r\nmentioned the best instrument for double transmission yet brought out.\"\r\nNot bad for a novice of twenty-two. It is natural, therefore, after his\r\nintervening work on indicators, stock tickers, automatic telegraphs, and\r\ntypewriters, to find him harking back to duplex telegraphy, if, indeed,\r\nhe can be said to have dropped it in the interval. It has always been\r\none of the characteristic features of Edison's method of inventing that\r\nwork in several lines has gone forward at the same time. No one line of\r\ninvestigation has ever been enough to occupy his thoughts fully; or to\r\nexpress it otherwise, he has found rest in turning from one field of\r\nwork to another, having absolutely no recreations or hobbies, and not\r\nneeding them. It may also be said that, once entering it, Mr. Edison has\r\nnever abandoned any field of work. He may change the line of attack; he\r\nmay drop the subject for a time; but sooner or later the note-books or\r\nthe Patent Office will bear testimony to the reminiscent outcropping of\r\nlatent thought on the matter. His attention has shifted chronologically,\r\nand by process of evolution, from one problem to another, and some\r\nresults are found to be final; but the interest of the man in the thing\r\nnever dies out. No one sees more vividly than he the fact that in the\r\ninterplay of the arts one industry shapes and helps another, and that no\r\ninvention lives to itself alone.\r\n\r\nThe path to the quadruplex lay through work on the duplex, which,\r\nsuggested first by Moses G. Farmer in 1852, had been elaborated by many\r\ningenious inventors, notably in this country by Stearns, before Edison\r\nonce again applied his mind to it. The different methods of such\r\nmultiple transmission--namely, the simultaneous dispatch of the two\r\ncommunications in opposite directions over the same wire, or the\r\ndispatch of both at once in the same direction--gave plenty of play to\r\ningenuity. Prescott's Elements of the Electric Telegraph, a standard\r\nwork in its day, described \"a method of simultaneous transmission\r\ninvented by T. A. Edison, of New Jersey, in 1873,\" and says of it: \"Its\r\npeculiarity consists in the fact that the signals are transmitted in one\r\ndirection by reversing the polarity of a constant current, and in the\r\nopposite direction by increasing or decreasing the strength of the same\r\ncurrent.\" Herein lay the germ of the Edison quadruplex. It is also noted\r\nthat \"In 1874 Edison invented a method of simultaneous transmission\r\nby induced currents, which has given very satisfactory results in\r\nexperimental trials.\" Interest in the duplex as a field of invention\r\ndwindled, however, as the quadruplex loomed up, for while the one\r\ndoubled the capacity of a circuit, the latter created three \"phantom\r\nwires,\" and thus quadruplexed the working capacity of any line to which\r\nit was applied. As will have been gathered from the above, the principle\r\nembodied in the quadruplex is that of working over the line with two\r\ncurrents from each end that differ from each other in strength or\r\nnature, so that they will affect only instruments adapted to respond\r\nto just such currents and no others; and by so arranging the receiving\r\napparatus as not to be affected by the currents transmitted from its\r\nown end of the line. Thus by combining instruments that respond only\r\nto variation in the strength of current from the distant station, with\r\ninstruments that respond only to the change in the direction of current\r\nfrom the distant station, and by grouping a pair of these at each end of\r\nthe line, the quadruplex is the result. Four sending and four receiving\r\noperators are kept busy at each end, or eight in all. Aside from other\r\nmaterial advantages, it is estimated that at least from $15,000,000 to\r\n$20,000,000 has been saved by the Edison quadruplex merely in the cost\r\nof line construction in America.\r\n\r\nThe quadruplex has not as a rule the same working efficiency that\r\nfour separate wires have. This is due to the fact that when one of the\r\nreceiving operators is compelled to \"break\" the sending operator for\r\nany reason, the \"break\" causes the interruption of the work of eight\r\noperators, instead of two, as would be the case on a single wire. The\r\nworking efficiency of the quadruplex, therefore, with the apparatus in\r\ngood working condition, depends entirely upon the skill of the operators\r\nemployed to operate it. But this does not reflect upon or diminish the\r\ningenuity required for its invention. Speaking of the problem involved,\r\nEdison said some years later to Mr. Upton, his mathematical assistant,\r\nthat \"he always considered he was only working from one room to another.\r\nThus he was not confused by the amount of wire and the thought of\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe immense difficulties of reducing such a system to practice may be\r\nreadily conceived, especially when it is remembered that the \"line\"\r\nitself, running across hundreds of miles of country, is subject to all\r\nmanner of atmospheric conditions, and varies from moment to moment in\r\nits ability to carry current, and also when it is borne in mind that\r\nthe quadruplex requires at each end of the line a so-called \"artificial\r\nline,\" which must have the exact resistance of the working line and must\r\nbe varied with the variations in resistance of the working line. At this\r\njuncture other schemes were fermenting in his brain; but the quadruplex\r\nengrossed him. \"This problem was of most difficult and complicated kind,\r\nand I bent all my energies toward its solution. It required a peculiar\r\neffort of the mind, such as the imagining of eight different things\r\nmoving simultaneously on a mental plane, without anything to demonstrate\r\ntheir efficiency.\" It is perhaps hardly to be wondered at that when\r\nnotified he would have to pay 12 1/2 per cent. extra if his taxes in\r\nNewark were not at once paid, he actually forgot his own name when asked\r\nfor it suddenly at the City Hall, lost his place in the line, and, the\r\nfatal hour striking, had to pay the surcharge after all!\r\n\r\nSo important an invention as the quadruplex could not long go begging,\r\nbut there were many difficulties connected with its introduction, some\r\nof which are best described in Mr. Edison's own words: \"Around 1873 the\r\nowners of the Automatic Telegraph Company commenced negotiations with\r\nJay Gould for the purchase of the wires between New York and Washington,\r\nand the patents for the system, then in successful operation. Jay Gould\r\nat that time controlled the Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Company, and\r\nwas competing with the Western Union and endeavoring to depress Western\r\nUnion stock on the Exchange. About this time I invented the quadruplex.\r\nI wanted to interest the Western Union Telegraph Company in it, with\r\na view of selling it, but was unsuccessful until I made an arrangement\r\nwith the chief electrician of the company, so that he could be known as\r\na joint inventor and receive a portion of the money. At that time I was\r\nvery short of money, and needed it more than glory. This electrician\r\nappeared to want glory more than money, so it was an easy trade.\r\nI brought my apparatus over and was given a separate room with a\r\nmarble-tiled floor, which, by-the-way, was a very hard kind of floor to\r\nsleep on, and started in putting on the finishing touches.\r\n\r\n\"After two months of very hard work, I got a detail at regular times of\r\neight operators, and we got it working nicely from one room to another\r\nover a wire which ran to Albany and back. Under certain conditions of\r\nweather, one side of the quadruplex would work very shakily, and I had\r\nnot succeeded in ascertaining the cause of the trouble. On a certain\r\nday, when there was a board meeting of the company, I was to make an\r\nexhibition test. The day arrived. I had picked the best operators in New\r\nYork, and they were familiar with the apparatus. I arranged that if a\r\nstorm occurred, and the bad side got shaky, they should do the best\r\nthey could and draw freely on their imaginations. They were sending old\r\nmessages. About 1, o'clock everything went wrong, as there was a storm\r\nsomewhere near Albany, and the bad side got shaky. Mr. Orton, the\r\npresident, and Wm. H. Vanderbilt and the other directors came in. I had\r\nmy heart trying to climb up around my oesophagus. I was paying a sheriff\r\nfive dollars a day to withhold judgment which had been entered against\r\nme in a case which I had paid no attention to; and if the quadruplex had\r\nnot worked before the president, I knew I was to have trouble and might\r\nlose my machinery. The New York Times came out next day with a full\r\naccount. I was given $5000 as part payment for the invention, which\r\nmade me easy, and I expected the whole thing would be closed up. But Mr.\r\nOrton went on an extended tour just about that time. I had paid for all\r\nthe experiments on the quadruplex and exhausted the money, and I was\r\nagain in straits. In the mean time I had introduced the apparatus on the\r\nlines of the company, where it was very successful.\r\n\r\n\"At that time the general superintendent of the Western Union was Gen.\r\nT. T. Eckert (who had been Assistant Secretary of War with Stanton).\r\nEckert was secretly negotiating with Gould to leave the Western Union\r\nand take charge of the Atlantic & Pacific--Gould's company. One day\r\nEckert called me into his office and made inquiries about money matters.\r\nI told him Mr. Orton had gone off and left me without means, and I was\r\nin straits. He told me I would never get another cent, but that he\r\nknew a man who would buy it. I told him of my arrangement with the\r\nelectrician, and said I could not sell it as a whole to anybody; but if\r\nI got enough for it, I would sell all my interest in any SHARE I might\r\nhave. He seemed to think his party would agree to this. I had a set\r\nof quadruplex over in my shop, 10 and 12 Ward Street, Newark, and he\r\narranged to bring him over next evening to see the apparatus. So the\r\nnext morning Eckert came over with Jay Gould and introduced him to me.\r\nThis was the first time I had ever seen him. I exhibited and explained\r\nthe apparatus, and they departed. The next day Eckert sent for me, and\r\nI was taken up to Gould's house, which was near the Windsor Hotel, Fifth\r\nAvenue. In the basement he had an office. It was in the evening, and we\r\nwent in by the servants' entrance, as Eckert probably feared that he\r\nwas watched. Gould started in at once and asked me how much I wanted.\r\nI said: 'Make me an offer.' Then he said: 'I will give you $30,000.' I\r\nsaid: 'I will sell any interest I may have for that money,' which was\r\nsomething more than I thought I could get. The next morning I went with\r\nGould to the office of his lawyers, Sherman & Sterling, and received a\r\ncheck for $30,000, with a remark by Gould that I had got the steamboat\r\nPlymouth Rock, as he had sold her for $30,000 and had just received the\r\ncheck. There was a big fight on between Gould's company and the Western\r\nUnion, and this caused more litigation. The electrician, on account\r\nof the testimony involved, lost his glory. The judge never decided\r\nthe case, but went crazy a few months afterward.\" It was obviously a\r\ncharacteristically shrewd move on the part of Mr. Gould to secure an\r\ninterest in the quadruplex, as a factor in his campaign against the\r\nWestern Union, and as a decisive step toward his control of that system,\r\nby the subsequent merger that included not only the Atlantic & Pacific\r\nTelegraph Company, but the American Union Telegraph Company.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Gould less appreciative of the value of Edison's automatic\r\nsystem. Referring to matters that will be taken up later in the\r\nnarrative, Edison says: \"After this Gould wanted me to help install the\r\nautomatic system in the Atlantic & Pacific company, of which General\r\nEckert had been elected president, the company having bought the\r\nAutomatic Telegraph Company. I did a lot of work for this company making\r\nautomatic apparatus in my shop at Newark. About this time I invented a\r\ndistrict messenger call-box system, and organized a company called the\r\nDomestic Telegraph Company, and started in to install the system in\r\nNew York. I had great difficulty in getting subscribers, having tried\r\nseveral canvassers, who, one after the other, failed to get subscribers.\r\nWhen I was about to give it up, a test operator named Brown, who was\r\non the Automatic Telegraph wire between New York and Washington, which\r\npassed through my Newark shop, asked permission to let him try and see\r\nif he couldn't get subscribers. I had very little faith in his ability\r\nto get any, but I thought I would give him a chance, as he felt\r\ncertain of his ability to succeed. He started in, and the results were\r\nsurprising. Within a month he had procured two hundred subscribers, and\r\nthe company was a success. I have never quite understood why six men\r\nshould fail absolutely, while the seventh man should succeed. Perhaps\r\nhypnotism would account for it. This company was sold out to the\r\nAtlantic & Pacific company.\" As far back as 1872, Edison had applied for\r\na patent on district messenger signal boxes, but it was not issued until\r\nJanuary, 1874, another patent being granted in September of the same\r\nyear. In this field of telegraph application, as in others, Edison was\r\na very early comer, his only predecessor being the fertile and ingenious\r\nCallahan, of stock-ticker fame. The first president of the Gold & Stock\r\nTelegraph Company, Elisha W. Andrews, had resigned in 1870 in order\r\nto go to England to introduce the stock ticker in London. He lived in\r\nEnglewood, New Jersey, and the very night he had packed his trunk the\r\nhouse was burglarized. Calling on his nearest friend the next morning\r\nfor even a pair of suspenders, Mr. Andrews was met with regrets of\r\ninability, because the burglars had also been there. A third and fourth\r\nfriend in the vicinity was appealed to with the same disheartening reply\r\nof a story of wholesale spoliation. Mr. Callahan began immediately to\r\ndevise a system of protection for Englewood; but at that juncture a\r\nservant-girl who had been for many years with a family on the Heights\r\nin Brooklyn went mad suddenly and held an aged widow and her daughter\r\nas helpless prisoners for twenty-four hours without food or water. This\r\nincident led to an extension of the protective idea, and very soon a\r\nsystem was installed in Brooklyn with one hundred subscribers. Out of\r\nthis grew in turn the district messenger system, for it was just as\r\neasy to call a messenger as to sound a fire-alarm or summon the police.\r\nTo-day no large city in America is without a service of this character,\r\nbut its function was sharply limited by the introduction of the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\nReturning to the automatic telegraph it is interesting to note that so\r\nlong as Edison was associated with it as a supervising providence it did\r\nsplendid work, which renders the later neglect of automatic or \"rapid\r\ntelegraphy\" the more remarkable. Reid's standard Telegraph in America\r\nbears astonishing testimony on this point in 1880, as follows: \"The\r\nAtlantic & Pacific Telegraph Company had twenty-two automatic stations.\r\nThese included the chief cities on the seaboard, Buffalo, Chicago,\r\nand Omaha. The through business during nearly two years was largely\r\ntransmitted in this way. Between New York and Boston two thousand words\r\na minute have been sent. The perforated paper was prepared at the rate\r\nof twenty words per minute. Whatever its demerits this system enabled\r\nthe Atlantic & Pacific company to handle a much larger business during\r\n1875 and 1876 than it could otherwise have done with its limited\r\nnumber of wires in their then condition.\" Mr. Reid also notes as a\r\nvery thorough test of the perfect practicability of the system, that it\r\nhandled the President's message, December 3, 1876, of 12,600 words with\r\ncomplete success. This long message was filed at Washington at 1.05 and\r\ndelivered in New York at 2.07. The first 9000 words were transmitted\r\nin forty-five minutes. The perforated strips were prepared in thirty\r\nminutes by ten persons, and duplicated by nine copyists. But to-day,\r\nnearly thirty-five years later, telegraphy in America is still\r\npractically on a basis of hand transmission!\r\n\r\nOf this period and his association with Jay Gould, some very interesting\r\nglimpses are given by Edison. \"While engaged in putting in the automatic\r\nsystem, I saw a great deal of Gould, and frequently went uptown to his\r\noffice to give information. Gould had no sense of humor. I tried several\r\ntimes to get off what seemed to me a funny story, but he failed to see\r\nany humor in them. I was very fond of stories, and had a choice\r\nlot, always kept fresh, with which I could usually throw a man into\r\nconvulsions. One afternoon Gould started in to explain the great future\r\nof the Union Pacific Railroad, which he then controlled. He got a map,\r\nand had an immense amount of statistics. He kept at it for over four\r\nhours, and got very enthusiastic. Why he should explain to me, a mere\r\ninventor, with no capital or standing, I couldn't make out. He had a\r\npeculiar eye, and I made up my mind that there was a strain of insanity\r\nsomewhere. This idea was strengthened shortly afterward when the Western\r\nUnion raised the monthly rental of the stock tickers. Gould had one in\r\nhis house office, which he watched constantly. This he had removed,\r\nto his great inconvenience, because the price had been advanced a few\r\ndollars! He railed over it. This struck me as abnormal. I think Gould's\r\nsuccess was due to abnormal development. He certainly had one trait\r\nthat all men must have who want to succeed. He collected every kind of\r\ninformation and statistics about his schemes, and had all the data. His\r\nconnection with men prominent in official life, of which I was aware,\r\nwas surprising to me. His conscience seemed to be atrophied, but that\r\nmay be due to the fact that he was contending with men who never had any\r\nto be atrophied. He worked incessantly until 12 or 1 o'clock at night.\r\nHe took no pride in building up an enterprise. He was after money, and\r\nmoney only. Whether the company was a success or a failure mattered not\r\nto him. After he had hammered the Western Union through his opposition\r\ncompany and had tired out Mr. Vanderbilt, the latter retired from\r\ncontrol, and Gould went in and consolidated his company and controlled\r\nthe Western Union. He then repudiated the contract with the Automatic\r\nTelegraph people, and they never received a cent for their wires or\r\npatents, and I lost three years of very hard labor. But I never had any\r\ngrudge against him, because he was so able in his line, and as long as\r\nmy part was successful the money with me was a secondary consideration.\r\nWhen Gould got the Western Union I knew no further progress in\r\ntelegraphy was possible, and I went into other lines.\" The truth is\r\nthat General Eckert was a conservative--even a reactionary--and being\r\nprejudiced like many other American telegraph managers against \"machine\r\ntelegraphy,\" threw out all such improvements.\r\n\r\nThe course of electrical history has been variegated by some very\r\nremarkable litigation; but none was ever more extraordinary than that\r\nreferred to here as arising from the transfer of the Automatic Telegraph\r\nCompany to Mr. Jay Gould and the Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Company.\r\nThe terms accepted by Colonel Reiff from Mr. Gould, on December 30,\r\n1874, provided that the purchasing telegraph company should increase its\r\ncapital to $15,000,000, of which the Automatic interests were to receive\r\n$4,000,000 for their patents, contracts, etc. The stock was then selling\r\nat about 25, and in the later consolidation with the Western Union\r\n\"went in\" at about 60; so that the real purchase price was not less than\r\n$1,000,000 in cash. There was a private arrangement in writing with Mr.\r\nGould that he was to receive one-tenth of the \"result\" to the Automatic\r\ngroup, and a tenth of the further results secured at home and abroad.\r\nMr. Gould personally bought up and gave money and bonds for one or two\r\nindividual interests on the above basis, including that of Harrington,\r\nwho in his representative capacity executed assignments to Mr. Gould.\r\nBut payments were then stopped, and the other owners were left without\r\nany compensation, although all that belonged to them in the shape of\r\nproperty and patents was taken over bodily into Atlantic & Pacific\r\nhands, and never again left them. Attempts at settlement were made in\r\ntheir behalf, and dragged wearily, due apparently to the fact that\r\nthe plans were blocked by General Eckert, who had in some manner taken\r\noffence at a transaction effected without his active participation in\r\nall the details. Edison, who became under the agreement the electrician\r\nof the Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Company, has testified to the\r\nunfriendly attitude assumed toward him by General Eckert, as president.\r\nIn a graphic letter from Menlo Park to Mr. Gould, dated February 2,\r\n1877, Edison makes a most vigorous and impassioned complaint of\r\nhis treatment, \"which, acting cumulatively, was a long, unbroken\r\ndisappointment to me\"; and he reminds Mr. Gould of promises made to\r\nhim the day the transfer had been effected of Edison's interest in the\r\nquadruplex. The situation was galling to the busy, high-spirited young\r\ninventor, who, moreover, \"had to live\"; and it led to his resumption of\r\nwork for the Western Union Telegraph Company, which was only too glad to\r\nget him back. Meantime, the saddened and perplexed Automatic group was\r\nleft unpaid, and it was not until 1906, on a bill filed nearly thirty\r\nyears before, that Judge Hazel, in the United States Circuit Court\r\nfor the Southern District of New York, found strongly in favor of the\r\nclaimants and ordered an accounting. The court held that there had been\r\na most wrongful appropriation of the patents, including alike those\r\nrelating to the automatic, the duplex, and the quadruplex, all being\r\nincluded in the general arrangement under which Mr. Gould had held put\r\nhis tempting bait of $4,000,000. In the end, however, the complainant\r\nhad nothing to show for all his struggle, as the master who made the\r\naccounting set the damages at one dollar!\r\n\r\nAside from the great value of the quadruplex, saving millions of\r\ndollars, for a share in which Edison received $30,000, the automatic\r\nitself is described as of considerable utility by Sir William Thomson in\r\nhis juror report at the Centennial Exposition of 1876, recommending it\r\nfor award. This leading physicist of his age, afterward Lord Kelvin, was\r\nan adept in telegraphy, having made the ocean cable talk, and he saw in\r\nEdison's \"American Automatic,\" as exhibited by the Atlantic & Pacific\r\ncompany, a most meritorious and useful system. With the aid of Mr. E.\r\nH. Johnson he made exhaustive tests, carrying away with him to Glasgow\r\nUniversity the surprising records that he obtained. His official report\r\ncloses thus: \"The electromagnetic shunt with soft iron core, invented\r\nby Mr. Edison, utilizing Professor Henry's discovery of electromagnetic\r\ninduction in a single circuit to produce a momentary reversal of the\r\nline current at the instant when the battery is thrown off and so cut\r\noff the chemical marks sharply at the proper instant, is the electrical\r\nsecret of the great speed he has achieved. The main peculiarities of Mr.\r\nEdison's automatic telegraph shortly stated in conclusion are: (1) the\r\nperforator; (2) the contact-maker; (3) the electromagnetic shunt; and\r\n(4) the ferric cyanide of iron solution. It deserves award as a very\r\nimportant step in land telegraphy.\" The attitude thus disclosed toward\r\nMr. Edison's work was never changed, except that admiration grew as\r\nfresh inventions were brought forward. To the day of his death Lord\r\nKelvin remained on terms of warmest friendship with his American\r\nco-laborer, with whose genius he thus first became acquainted at\r\nPhiladelphia in the environment of Franklin.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give any complete idea of the activity maintained at\r\nthe Newark shops during these anxious, harassed years, but the statement\r\nthat at one time no fewer than forty-five different inventions were\r\nbeing worked upon, will furnish some notion of the incandescent activity\r\nof the inventor and his assistants. The hours were literally endless;\r\nand upon one occasion, when the order was in hand for a large quantity\r\nof stock tickers, Edison locked his men in until the job had been\r\nfinished of making the machine perfect, and \"all the bugs taken out,\"\r\nwhich meant sixty hours of unintermitted struggle with the difficulties.\r\nNor were the problems and inventions all connected with telegraphy.\r\nOn the contrary, Edison's mind welcomed almost any new suggestion as a\r\nrelief from the regular work in hand. Thus: \"Toward the latter part of\r\n1875, in the Newark shop, I invented a device for multiplying copies of\r\nletters, which I sold to Mr. A. B. Dick, of Chicago, and in the years\r\nsince it has been universally introduced throughout the world. It is\r\ncalled the 'Mimeograph.' I also invented devices for and introduced\r\nparaffin paper, now used universally for wrapping up candy, etc.\"\r\nThe mimeograph employs a pointed stylus, used as in writing with a\r\nlead-pencil, which is moved over a kind of tough prepared paper placed\r\non a finely grooved steel plate. The writing is thus traced by means of\r\na series of minute perforations in the sheet, from which, as a stencil,\r\nhundreds of copies can be made. Such stencils can be prepared on\r\ntypewriters. Edison elaborated this principle in two other forms--one\r\npneumatic and one electric--the latter being in essence a reciprocating\r\nmotor. Inside the barrel of the electric pen a little plunger, carrying\r\nthe stylus, travels to and fro at a very high rate of speed, due to the\r\nattraction and repulsion of the solenoid coils of wire surrounding it;\r\nand as the hand of the writer guides it the pen thus makes its record\r\nin a series of very minute perforations in the paper. The current from\r\na small battery suffices to energize the pen, and with the stencil thus\r\nmade hundreds of copies of the document can be furnished. As a matter\r\nof fact, as many as three thousand copies have been made from a single\r\nmimeographic stencil of this character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONE, MOTOGRAPH, AND MICROPHONE\r\n\r\nA VERY great invention has its own dramatic history. Episodes full of\r\nhuman interest attend its development. The periods of weary struggle,\r\nthe daring adventure along unknown paths, the clash of rival claimants,\r\nare closely similar to those which mark the revelation and subjugation\r\nof a new continent. At the close of the epoch of discovery it is seen\r\nthat mankind as a whole has made one more great advance; but in the\r\nearlier stages one watched chiefly the confused vicissitudes of fortune\r\nof the individual pioneers. The great modern art of telephony has had\r\nthus in its beginnings, its evolution, and its present status as a\r\nuniversal medium of intercourse, all the elements of surprise, mystery,\r\nswift creation of wealth, tragic interludes, and colossal battle that\r\ncan appeal to the imagination and hold public attention. And in this\r\nnew electrical industry, in laying its essential foundations, Edison has\r\nagain been one of the dominant figures.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1837, the American, Page, discovered the curious fact\r\nthat an iron bar, when magnetized and demagnetized at short intervals\r\nof time, emitted sounds due to the molecular disturbances in the mass.\r\nPhilipp Reis, a simple professor in Germany, utilized this principle in\r\nthe construction of apparatus for the transmission of sound; but in the\r\ngrasp of the idea he was preceded by Charles Bourseul, a young French\r\nsoldier in Algeria, who in 1854, under the title of \"Electrical\r\nTelephony,\" in a Parisian illustrated paper, gave a brief and lucid\r\ndescription as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We know that sounds are made by vibrations, and are made sensible to\r\nthe ear by the same vibrations, which are reproduced by the intervening\r\nmedium. But the intensity of the vibrations diminishes very rapidly with\r\nthe distance; so that even with the aid of speaking-tubes and trumpets\r\nit is impossible to exceed somewhat narrow limits. Suppose a man speaks\r\nnear a movable disk sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations\r\nof the voice; that this disk alternately makes and breaks the connection\r\nwith a battery; you may have at a distance another disk which will\r\nsimultaneously execute the same vibrations.... Any one who is not deaf\r\nand dumb may use this mode of transmission, which would require no\r\napparatus except an electric battery, two vibrating disks, and a wire.\"\r\n\r\nThis would serve admirably for a portrayal of the Bell telephone, except\r\nthat it mentions distinctly the use of the make-and-break method (i.\r\ne., where the circuit is necessarily opened and closed as in telegraphy,\r\nalthough, of course, at an enormously higher rate), which has never\r\nproved practical.\r\n\r\nSo far as is known Bourseul was not practical enough to try his own\r\nsuggestion, and never made a telephone. About 1860, Reis built several\r\nforms of electrical telephonic apparatus, all imitating in some degree\r\nthe human ear, with its auditory tube, tympanum, etc., and examples\r\nof the apparatus were exhibited in public not only in Germany, but in\r\nEngland. There is a variety of testimony to the effect that not only\r\nmusical sounds, but stray words and phrases, were actually transmitted\r\nwith mediocre, casual success. It was impossible, however, to maintain\r\nthe devices in adjustment for more than a few seconds, since the\r\ninvention depended upon the make-and-break principle, the circuit being\r\nmade and broken every time an impulse-creating sound went through it,\r\ncausing the movement of the diaphragm on which the sound-waves impinged.\r\nReis himself does not appear to have been sufficiently interested in the\r\nmarvellous possibilities of the idea to follow it up--remarking to the\r\nman who bought his telephonic instruments and tools that he had shown\r\nthe world the way. In reality it was not the way, although a monument\r\nerected to his memory at Frankfort styles him the inventor of the\r\ntelephone. As one of the American judges said, in deciding an early\r\nlitigation over the invention of the telephone, a hundred years of Reis\r\nwould not have given the world the telephonic art for public use. Many\r\nothers after Reis tried to devise practical make-and-break telephones,\r\nand all failed; although their success would have rendered them very\r\nvaluable as a means of fighting the Bell patent. But the method was a\r\ngood starting-point, even if it did not indicate the real path. If Reis\r\nhad been willing to experiment with his apparatus so that it did not\r\nmake-and-break, he would probably have been the true father of the\r\ntelephone, besides giving it the name by which it is known. It was not\r\nnecessary to slam the gate open and shut. All that was required was to\r\nkeep the gate closed, and rattle the latch softly. Incidentally it\r\nmay be noted that Edison in experimenting with the Reis transmitter\r\nrecognized at once the defect caused by the make-and-break action, and\r\nsought to keep the gap closed by the use, first, of one drop of water,\r\nand later of several drops. But the water decomposed, and the incurable\r\ndefect was still there.\r\n\r\nThe Reis telephone was brought to America by Dr. P. H. Van der Weyde,\r\na well-known physicist in his day, and was exhibited by him before a\r\ntechnical audience at Cooper Union, New York, in 1868, and described\r\nshortly after in the technical press. The apparatus attracted attention,\r\nand a set was secured by Prof. Joseph Henry for the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. There the famous philosopher showed and explained it to\r\nAlexander Graham Bell, when that young and persevering Scotch genius\r\nwent to get help and data as to harmonic telegraphy, upon which he was\r\nworking, and as to transmitting vocal sounds. Bell took up immediately\r\nand energetically the idea that his two predecessors had dropped--and\r\nreached the goal. In 1875 Bell, who as a student and teacher of vocal\r\nphysiology had unusual qualifications for determining feasible methods\r\nof speech transmission, constructed his first pair of magneto telephones\r\nfor such a purpose. In February of 1876 his first telephone patent was\r\napplied for, and in March it was issued. The first published account\r\nof the modern speaking telephone was a paper read by Bell before the\r\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston in May of that year;\r\nwhile at the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia the public first\r\ngained any familiarity with it. It was greeted at once with scientific\r\nacclaim and enthusiasm as a distinctly new and great invention, although\r\nat first it was regarded more as a scientific toy than as a commercially\r\nvaluable device.\r\n\r\nBy an extraordinary coincidence, the very day that Bell's application\r\nfor a patent went into the United States Patent Office, a caveat was\r\nfiled there by Elisha Gray, of Chicago, covering the specific idea of\r\ntransmitting speech and reproducing it in a telegraphic circuit \"through\r\nan instrument capable of vibrating responsively to all the tones of\r\nthe human voice, and by which they are rendered audible.\" Out of this\r\nincident arose a struggle and a controversy whose echoes are yet heard\r\nas to the legal and moral rights of the two inventors, the assertion\r\neven being made that one of the most important claims of Gray, that on\r\na liquid battery transmitter, was surreptitiously \"lifted\" into the\r\nBell application, then covering only the magneto telephone. It was also\r\nasserted that the filing of the Gray caveat antedated by a few hours\r\nthe filing of the Bell application. All such issues when brought to\r\nthe American courts were brushed aside, the Bell patent being broadly\r\nmaintained in all its remarkable breadth and fullness, embracing an\r\nentire art; but Gray was embittered and chagrined, and to the last\r\nexpressed his belief that the honor and glory should have been his. The\r\npath of Gray to the telephone was a natural one. A Quaker carpenter who\r\nstudied five years at Oberlin College, he took up electrical invention,\r\nand brought out many ingenious devices in rapid succession in the\r\ntelegraphic field, including the now universal needle annunciator for\r\nhotels, etc., the useful telautograph, automatic self-adjusting relays,\r\nprivate-line printers--leading up to his famous \"harmonic\" system. This\r\nwas based upon the principle that a sound produced in the presence of a\r\nreed or tuning-fork responding to the sound, and acting as the armature\r\nof a magnet in a closed circuit, would, by induction, set up electric\r\nimpulses in the circuit and cause a distant magnet having a similarly\r\ntuned armature to produce the same tone or note. He also found that over\r\nthe same wire at the same time another series of impulses corresponding\r\nto another note could be sent through the agency of a second set\r\nof magnets without in any way interfering with the first series of\r\nimpulses. Building the principle into apparatus, with a keyboard and\r\nvibrating \"reeds\" before his magnets, Doctor Gray was able not only to\r\ntransmit music by his harmonic telegraph, but went so far as to send\r\nnine different telegraph messages at the same instant, each set of\r\ninstruments depending on its selective note, while any intermediate\r\noffice could pick up the message for itself by simply tuning its relays\r\nto the keynote required. Theoretically the system could be split up into\r\nany number of notes and semi-tones. Practically it served as the basis\r\nof some real telegraphic work, but is not now in use. Any one can\r\nrealize, however, that it did not take so acute and ingenious a mind\r\nvery long to push forward to the telephone, as a dangerous competitor\r\nwith Bell, who had also, like Edison, been working assiduously in the\r\nfield of acoustic and multiple telegraphs. Seen in the retrospect, the\r\nstruggle for the goal at this moment was one of the memorable incidents\r\nin electrical history.\r\n\r\nAmong the interesting papers filed at the Orange Laboratory is a\r\nlithograph, the size of an ordinary patent drawing, headed \"First\r\nTelephone on Record.\" The claim thus made goes back to the period\r\nwhen all was war, and when dispute was hot and rife as to the actual\r\ninvention of the telephone. The device shown, made by Edison in 1875,\r\nwas actually included in a caveat filed January 14, 1876, a month before\r\nBell or Gray. It shows a little solenoid arrangement, with one end\r\nof the plunger attached to the diaphragm of a speaking or resonating\r\nchamber. Edison states that while the device is crudely capable of use\r\nas a magneto telephone, he did not invent it for transmitting speech,\r\nbut as an apparatus for analyzing the complex waves arising from various\r\nsounds. It was made in pursuance of his investigations into the subject\r\nof harmonic telegraphs. He did not try the effect of sound-waves\r\nproduced by the human voice until Bell came forward a few months later;\r\nbut he found then that this device, made in 1875, was capable of use as\r\na telephone. In his testimony and public utterances Edison has always\r\ngiven Bell credit for the discovery of the transmission of articulate\r\nspeech by talking against a diaphragm placed in front of an\r\nelectromagnet; but it is only proper here to note, in passing, the\r\ncurious fact that he had actually produced a device that COULD talk,\r\nprior to 1876, and was therefore very close to Bell, who took the\r\none great step further. A strong characterization of the value and\r\nimportance of the work done by Edison in the development of the carbon\r\ntransmitter will be found in the decision of Judge Brown in the United\r\nStates Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in Boston, on February 27,\r\n1901, declaring void the famous Berliner patent of the Bell telephone\r\nsystem. [5]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 5: See Federal Reporter, vol. 109, p. 976 et seq.]\r\n\r\nBell's patent of 1876 was of an all-embracing character, which only\r\nthe make-and-break principle, if practical, could have escaped. It was\r\npointed out in the patent that Bell discovered the great principle that\r\nelectrical undulations induced by the vibrations of a current produced\r\nby sound-waves can be represented graphically by the same sinusoidal\r\ncurve that expresses the original sound vibrations themselves; or, in\r\nother words, that a curve representing sound vibrations will correspond\r\nprecisely to a curve representing electric impulses produced or\r\ngenerated by those identical sound vibrations--as, for example, when\r\nthe latter impinge upon a diaphragm acting as an armature of an\r\nelectromagnet, and which by movement to and fro sets up the electric\r\nimpulses by induction. To speak plainly, the electric impulses\r\ncorrespond in form and character to the sound vibration which they\r\nrepresent. This reduced to a patent \"claim\" governed the art as firmly\r\nas a papal bull for centuries enabled Spain to hold the Western\r\nworld. The language of the claim is: \"The method of and apparatus for\r\ntransmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically as herein described,\r\nby causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of\r\nthe air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds substantially as set\r\nforth.\" It was a long time, however, before the inclusive nature of this\r\ngrant over every possible telephone was understood or recognized, and\r\nlitigation for and against the patent lasted during its entire life. At\r\nthe outset, the commercial value of the telephone was little appreciated\r\nby the public, and Bell had the greatest difficulty in securing capital;\r\nbut among far-sighted inventors there was an immediate \"rush to the gold\r\nfields.\" Bell's first apparatus was poor, the results being described by\r\nhimself as \"unsatisfactory and discouraging,\" which was almost as\r\ntrue of the devices he exhibited at the Philadelphia Centennial. The\r\nnew-comers, like Edison, Berliner, Blake, Hughes, Gray, Dolbear, and\r\nothers, brought a wealth of ideas, a fund of mechanical ingenuity,\r\nand an inventive ability which soon made the telephone one of the most\r\nnotable gains of the century, and one of the most valuable additions\r\nto human resources. The work that Edison did was, as usual, marked by\r\ninfinite variety of method as well as by the power to seize on the\r\none needed element of practical success. Every one of the six million\r\ntelephones in use in the United States, and of the other millions in use\r\nthrough out the world, bears the imprint of his genius, as at one time\r\nthe instruments bore his stamped name. For years his name was branded\r\non every Bell telephone set, and his patents were a mainstay of what has\r\nbeen popularly called the \"Bell monopoly.\" Speaking of his own efforts\r\nin this field, Mr. Edison says:\r\n\r\n\"In 1876 I started again to experiment for the Western Union and\r\nMr. Orton. This time it was the telephone. Bell invented the first\r\ntelephone, which consisted of the present receiver, used both as a\r\ntransmitter and a receiver (the magneto type). It was attempted to\r\nintroduce it commercially, but it failed on account of its faintness and\r\nthe extraneous sounds which came in on its wires from various causes.\r\nMr. Orton wanted me to take hold of it and make it commercial. As I\r\nhad also been working on a telegraph system employing tuning-forks,\r\nsimultaneously with both Bell and Gray, I was pretty familiar with the\r\nsubject. I started in, and soon produced the carbon transmitter, which\r\nis now universally used.\r\n\r\n\"Tests were made between New York and Philadelphia, also between New\r\nYork and Washington, using regular Western Union wires. The noises were\r\nso great that not a word could be heard with the Bell receiver when used\r\nas a transmitter between New York and Newark, New Jersey. Mr. Orton and\r\nW. K. Vanderbilt and the board of directors witnessed and took part\r\nin the tests. The Western Union then put them on private lines. Mr.\r\nTheodore Puskas, of Budapest, Hungary, was the first man to suggest\r\na telephone exchange, and soon after exchanges were established. The\r\ntelephone department was put in the hands of Hamilton McK. Twombly,\r\nVanderbilt's ablest son-in-law, who made a success of it. The Bell\r\ncompany, of Boston, also started an exchange, and the fight was on,\r\nthe Western Union pirating the Bell receiver, and the Boston company\r\npirating the Western Union transmitter. About this time I wanted to be\r\ntaken care of. I threw out hints of this desire. Then Mr. Orton sent\r\nfor me. He had learned that inventors didn't do business by the regular\r\nprocess, and concluded he would close it right up. He asked me how much\r\nI wanted. I had made up my mind it was certainly worth $25,000, if it\r\never amounted to anything for central-station work, so that was the sum\r\nI had in mind to stick to and get--obstinately. Still it had been an\r\neasy job, and only required a few months, and I felt a little shaky and\r\nuncertain. So I asked him to make me an offer. He promptly said he would\r\ngive me $100,000. 'All right,' I said. 'It is yours on one condition,\r\nand that is that you do not pay it all at once, but pay me at the rate\r\nof $6000 per year for seventeen years'--the life of the patent. He\r\nseemed only too pleased to do this, and it was closed. My ambition was\r\nabout four times too large for my business capacity, and I knew that I\r\nwould soon spend this money experimenting if I got it all at once, so\r\nI fixed it that I couldn't. I saved seventeen years of worry by this\r\nstroke.\"\r\n\r\nThus modestly is told the debut of Edison in the telephone art, to which\r\nwith his carbon transmitter he gave the valuable principle of varying\r\nthe resistance of the transmitting circuit with changes in the pressure,\r\nas well as the vital practice of using the induction coil as a means of\r\nincreasing the effective length of the talking circuit. Without these,\r\nmodern telephony would not and could not exist. [6] But Edison, in\r\ntelephonic work, as in other directions, was remarkably fertile and\r\nprolific. His first inventions in the art, made in 1875-76, continue\r\nthrough many later years, including all kinds of carbon instruments\r\n--the water telephone, electrostatic telephone, condenser telephone,\r\nchemical telephone, various magneto telephones, inertia telephone,\r\nmercury telephone, voltaic pile telephone, musical transmitter, and the\r\nelectromotograph. All were actually made and tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 6: Briefly stated, the essential difference\r\n     between Bell's telephone and Edison's is this: With the\r\n     former the sound vibrations impinge upon a steel diaphragm\r\n     arranged adjacent to the pole of a bar electromagnet,\r\n     whereby the diaphragm acts as an armature, and by its\r\n     vibrations induces very weak electric impulses in the\r\n     magnetic coil. These impulses, according to Bell's theory,\r\n     correspond in form to the sound-waves, and passing over the\r\n     line energize the magnet coil at the receiving end, and by\r\n     varying the magnetism cause the receiving diaphragm to be\r\n     similarly vibrated to reproduce the sounds. A single\r\n     apparatus is therefore used at each end, performing the\r\n     double function of transmitter and receiver. With Edison's\r\n     telephone a closed circuit is used on which is constantly\r\n     flowing a battery current, and included in that circuit is a\r\n     pair of electrodes, one or both of which is of carbon. These\r\n     electrodes are always in contact with a certain initial\r\n     pressure, so that current will be always flowing over the\r\n     circuit. One of the electrodes is connected with the\r\n     diaphragm on which the sound-waves impinge, and the\r\n     vibration of this diaphragm causes the pressure between the\r\n     electrodes to be correspondingly varied, and thereby effects\r\n     a variation in the current, resulting in the production of\r\n     impulses which actuate the receiving magnet. In other words,\r\n     with Bell's telephone the sound-waves themselves generate\r\n     the electric impulses, which are hence extremely faint. With\r\n     the Edison telephone, the sound-waves actuate an electric\r\n     valve, so to speak, and permit variations in a current of\r\n     any desired strength.\r\n\r\n     A second distinction between the two telephones is this:\r\n     With the Bell apparatus the very weak electric impulses\r\n     generated by the vibration of the transmitting diaphragm\r\n     pass over the entire line to the receiving end, and in\r\n     consequence the permissible length of line is limited to a\r\n     few miles under ideal conditions. With Edison's telephone\r\n     the battery current does not flow on the main line, but\r\n     passes through the primary circuit of an induction coil, by\r\n     which corresponding impulses of enormously higher potential\r\n     are sent out on the main line to the receiving end. In\r\n     consequence, the line may be hundreds of miles in length. No\r\n     modern telephone system in use to-day lacks these\r\n     characteristic features--the varying resistance and the\r\n     induction coil.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principle of the electromotograph was utilized by Edison in\r\nmore ways than one, first of all in telegraphy at this juncture. The\r\nwell-known Page patent, which had lingered in the Patent Office for\r\nyears, had just been issued, and was considered a formidable weapon. It\r\nrelated to the use of a retractile spring to withdraw the armature\r\nlever from the magnet of a telegraph or other relay or sounder, and thus\r\ncontrolled the art of telegraphy, except in simple circuits. \"There was\r\nno known way,\" remarks Edison, \"whereby this patent could be evaded, and\r\nits possessor would eventually control the use of what is known as the\r\nrelay and sounder, and this was vital to telegraphy. Gould was pounding\r\nthe Western Union on the Stock Exchange, disturbing its railroad\r\ncontracts, and, being advised by his lawyers that this patent was of\r\ngreat value, bought it. The moment Mr. Orton heard this he sent for me\r\nand explained the situation, and wanted me to go to work immediately and\r\nsee if I couldn't evade it or discover some other means that could be\r\nused in case Gould sustained the patent. It seemed a pretty hard job,\r\nbecause there was no known means of moving a lever at the other end of\r\na telegraph wire except by the use of a magnet. I said I would go at it\r\nthat night. In experimenting some years previously, I had discovered\r\na very peculiar phenomenon, and that was that if a piece of metal\r\nconnected to a battery was rubbed over a moistened piece of chalk\r\nresting on a metal connected to the other pole, when the current passed\r\nthe friction was greatly diminished. When the current was reversed the\r\nfriction was greatly increased over what it was when no current was\r\npassing. Remembering this, I substituted a piece of chalk rotated by\r\na small electric motor for the magnet, and connecting a sounder to a\r\nmetallic finger resting on the chalk, the combination claim of Page was\r\nmade worthless. A hitherto unknown means was introduced in the electric\r\nart. Two or three of the devices were made and tested by the company's\r\nexpert. Mr. Orton, after he had me sign the patent application and got\r\nit in the Patent Office, wanted to settle for it at once. He asked my\r\nprice. Again I said: 'Make me an offer.' Again he named $100,000. I\r\naccepted, providing he would pay it at the rate of $6000 a year for\r\nseventeen years. This was done, and thus, with the telephone money, I\r\nreceived $12,000 yearly for that period from the Western Union Telegraph\r\nCompany.\"\r\n\r\nA year or two later the motograph cropped up again in Edison's work in a\r\ncurious manner. The telephone was being developed in England, and Edison\r\nhad made arrangements with Colonel Gouraud, his old associate in the\r\nautomatic telegraph, to represent his interests. A company was formed, a\r\nlarge number of instruments were made and sent to Gouraud in London, and\r\nprospects were bright. Then there came a threat of litigation from\r\nthe owners of the Bell patent, and Gouraud found he could not push\r\nthe enterprise unless he could avoid using what was asserted to be an\r\ninfringement of the Bell receiver. He cabled for help to Edison, who\r\nsent back word telling him to hold the fort. \"I had recourse again,\"\r\nsays Edison, \"to the phenomenon discovered by me years previous, that\r\nthe friction of a rubbing electrode passing over a moist chalk surface\r\nwas varied by electricity. I devised a telephone receiver which was\r\nafterward known as the 'loud-speaking telephone,' or 'chalk receiver.'\r\nThere was no magnet, simply a diaphragm and a cylinder of compressed\r\nchalk about the size of a thimble. A thin spring connected to the centre\r\nof the diaphragm extended outwardly and rested on the chalk cylinder,\r\nand was pressed against it with a pressure equal to that which would be\r\ndue to a weight of about six pounds. The chalk was rotated by hand.\r\nThe volume of sound was very great. A person talking into the carbon\r\ntransmitter in New York had his voice so amplified that he could be\r\nheard one thousand feet away in an open field at Menlo Park. This great\r\nexcess of power was due to the fact that the latter came from the person\r\nturning the handle. The voice, instead of furnishing all the power\r\nas with the present receiver, merely controlled the power, just as an\r\nengineer working a valve would control a powerful engine.\r\n\r\n\"I made six of these receivers and sent them in charge of an expert on\r\nthe first steamer. They were welcomed and tested, and shortly afterward\r\nI shipped a hundred more. At the same time I was ordered to send twenty\r\nyoung men, after teaching them to become expert. I set up an exchange,\r\naround the laboratory, of ten instruments. I would then go out and get\r\neach one out of order in every conceivable way, cutting the wires of\r\none, short-circuiting another, destroying the adjustment of a third,\r\nputting dirt between the electrodes of a fourth, and so on. A man would\r\nbe sent to each to find out the trouble. When he could find the trouble\r\nten consecutive times, using five minutes each, he was sent to London.\r\nAbout sixty men were sifted to get twenty. Before all had arrived,\r\nthe Bell company there, seeing we could not be stopped, entered into\r\nnegotiations for consolidation. One day I received a cable from Gouraud\r\noffering '30,000' for my interest. I cabled back I would accept. When\r\nthe draft came I was astonished to find it was for L30,000. I had\r\nthought it was dollars.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to this singular and happy conclusion, Edison makes some\r\ninteresting comments as to the attitude of the courts toward inventors,\r\nand the difference between American and English courts. \"The men I sent\r\nover were used to establish telephone exchanges all over the Continent,\r\nand some of them became wealthy. It was among this crowd in London that\r\nBernard Shaw was employed before he became famous. The chalk telephone\r\nwas finally discarded in favor of the Bell receiver--the latter being\r\nmore simple and cheaper. Extensive litigation with new-comers followed.\r\nMy carbon-transmitter patent was sustained, and preserved the monopoly\r\nof the telephone in England for many years. Bell's patent was not\r\nsustained by the courts. Sir Richard Webster, now Chief-Justice of\r\nEngland, was my counsel, and sustained all of my patents in England for\r\nmany years. Webster has a marvellous capacity for understanding things\r\nscientific; and his address before the courts was lucidity itself. His\r\nbrain is highly organized. My experience with the legal fraternity is\r\nthat scientific subjects are distasteful to them, and it is rare in this\r\ncountry, on account of the system of trying patent suits, for a judge\r\nreally to reach the meat of the controversy, and inventors scarcely ever\r\nget a decision squarely and entirely in their favor. The fault rests, in\r\nmy judgment, almost wholly with the system under which testimony to the\r\nextent of thousands of pages bearing on all conceivable subjects, many\r\nof them having no possible connection with the invention in dispute,\r\nis presented to an over-worked judge in an hour or two of argument\r\nsupported by several hundred pages of briefs; and the judge is supposed\r\nto extract some essence of justice from this mass of conflicting, blind,\r\nand misleading statements. It is a human impossibility, no matter how\r\nable and fair-minded the judge may be. In England the case is different.\r\nThere the judges are face to face with the experts and other witnesses.\r\nThey get the testimony first-hand and only so much as they need, and\r\nthere are no long-winded briefs and arguments, and the case is decided\r\nthen and there, a few months perhaps after suit is brought, instead of\r\nmany years afterward, as in this country. And in England, when a case is\r\nonce finally decided it is settled for the whole country, while here it\r\nis not so. Here a patent having once been sustained, say, in Boston,\r\nmay have to be litigated all over again in New York, and again in\r\nPhiladelphia, and so on for all the Federal circuits. Furthermore, it\r\nseems to me that scientific disputes should be decided by some\r\ncourt containing at least one or two scientific men--men capable of\r\ncomprehending the significance of an invention and the difficulties of\r\nits accomplishment--if justice is ever to be given to an inventor. And\r\nI think, also, that this court should have the power to summon before it\r\nand examine any recognized expert in the special art, who might be able\r\nto testify to FACTS for or against the patent, instead of trying\r\nto gather the truth from the tedious essays of hired experts, whose\r\ndepositions are really nothing but sworn arguments. The real gist of\r\npatent suits is generally very simple, and I have no doubt that any\r\njudge of fair intelligence, assisted by one or more scientific advisers,\r\ncould in a couple of days at the most examine all the necessary\r\nwitnesses; hear all the necessary arguments, and actually decide an\r\nordinary patent suit in a way that would more nearly be just, than\r\ncan now be done at an expenditure of a hundred times as much money and\r\nmonths and years of preparation. And I have no doubt that the time taken\r\nby the court would be enormously less, because if a judge attempts to\r\nread the bulky records and briefs, that work alone would require several\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"Acting as judges, inventors would not be very apt to correctly decide\r\na complicated law point; and on the other hand, it is hard to see how a\r\nlawyer can decide a complicated scientific point rightly. Some inventors\r\ncomplain of our Patent Office, but my own experience with the Patent\r\nOffice is that the examiners are fair-minded and intelligent, and when\r\nthey refuse a patent they are generally right; but I think the whole\r\ntrouble lies with the system in vogue in the Federal courts for trying\r\npatent suits, and in the fact, which cannot be disputed, that the\r\nFederal judges, with but few exceptions, do not comprehend complicated\r\nscientific questions. To secure uniformity in the several Federal\r\ncircuits and correct errors, it has been proposed to establish a central\r\ncourt of patent appeals in Washington. This I believe in; but this court\r\nshould also contain at least two scientific men, who would not be blind\r\nto the sophistry of paid experts. [7] Men whose inventions would have\r\ncreated wealth of millions have been ruined and prevented from making\r\nany money whereby they could continue their careers as creators of\r\nwealth for the general good, just because the experts befuddled the\r\njudge by their misleading statements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 7: As an illustration of the perplexing nature of\r\n     expert evidence in patent cases, the reader will probably be\r\n     interested in perusing the following extracts from the\r\n     opinion of Judge Dayton, in the suit of Bryce Bros. Co. vs.\r\n     Seneca Glass Co., tried in the United States Circuit Court,\r\n     Northern District of West Virginia, reported in The Federal\r\n     Reporter, 140, page 161:\r\n\r\n     \"On this subject of the validity of this patent, a vast\r\n     amount of conflicting, technical, perplexing, and almost\r\n     hypercritical discussion and opinion has been indulged, both\r\n     in the testimony and in the able and exhaustive arguments\r\n     and briefs of counsel. Expert Osborn for defendant, after\r\n     setting forth minutely his superior qualifications\r\n     mechanical education, and great experience, takes up in\r\n     detail the patent claims, and shows to his own entire\r\n     satisfaction that none of them are new; that all of them\r\n     have been applied, under one form or another, in some\r\n     twenty-two previous patents, and in two other machines, not\r\n     patented, to-wit, the Central Glass and Kuny Kahbel ones;\r\n     that the whole machine is only 'an aggregation of well-known\r\n     mechanical elements that any skilled designer would bring to\r\n     his use in the construction of such a machine.' This\r\n     certainly, under ordinary conditions, would settle the\r\n     matter beyond peradventure; for this witness is a very wise\r\n     and learned man in these things, and very positive. But\r\n     expert Clarke appears for the plaintiff, and after setting\r\n     forth just as minutely his superior qualifications,\r\n     mechanical education, and great experience, which appear\r\n     fully equal in all respects to those of expert Osborn,\r\n     proceeds to take up in detail the patent claims, and shows\r\n     to his entire satisfaction that all, with possibly one\r\n     exception, are new, show inventive genius, and distinct\r\n     advances upon the prior art. In the most lucid, and even\r\n     fascinating, way he discusses all the parts of this machine,\r\n     compares it with the others, draws distinctions, points out\r\n     the merits of the one in controversy and the defects of all\r\n     the others, considers the twenty-odd patents referred to by\r\n     Osborn, and in the politest, but neatest, manner imaginable\r\n     shows that expert Osborn did not know what he was talking\r\n     about, and sums the whole matter up by declaring this\r\n     'invention of Mr. Schrader's, as embodied in the patent in\r\n     suit, a radical and wide departure, from the Kahbel machine'\r\n     (admitted on all sides to be nearest prior approach to it),\r\n     'a distinct and important advance in the art of engraving\r\n     glassware, and generally a machine for this purpose which\r\n     has involved the exercise of the inventive faculty in the\r\n     highest degree.'\r\n\r\n     \"Thus a more radical and irreconcilable disagreement between\r\n     experts touching the same thing could hardly be found. So it\r\n     is with the testimony. If we take that for the defendant,\r\n     the Central Glass Company machine, and especially the Kuny\r\n     Kahbel machine, built and operated years before this patent\r\n     issued, and not patented, are just as good, just as\r\n     effective and practical, as this one, and capable of turning\r\n     out just as perfect work and as great a variety of it. On\r\n     the other hand, if we take that produced by the plaintiff,\r\n     we are driven to the conclusion that these prior machines,\r\n     the product of the same mind, were only progressive steps\r\n     forward from utter darkness, so to speak, into full\r\n     inventive sunlight, which made clear to him the solution of\r\n     the problem in this patented machine. The shortcomings of\r\n     the earlier machines are minutely set forth, and the\r\n     witnesses for the plaintiff are clear that they are neither\r\n     practical nor profitable.\r\n\r\n     \"But this is not all of the trouble that confronts us in\r\n     this case. Counsel of both sides, with an indomitable\r\n     courage that must command admiration, a courage that has led\r\n     them to a vast amount of study, investigation, and thought,\r\n     that in fact has made them all experts, have dissected this\r\n     record of 356 closely printed pages, applied all mechanical\r\n     principles and laws to the facts as they see them, and,\r\n     besides, have ransacked the law-books and cited an enormous\r\n     number of cases, more or less in point, as illustration of\r\n     their respective contentions. The courts find nothing more\r\n     difficult than to apply an abstract principle to all classes\r\n     of cases that may arise. The facts in each case so\r\n     frequently create an exception to the general rule that such\r\n     rule must be honored rather in its breach than in its\r\n     observance. Therefore, after a careful examination of these\r\n     cases, it is no criticism of the courts to say that both\r\n     sides have found abundant and about an equal amount of\r\n     authority to sustain their respective contentions, and, as a\r\n     result, counsel have submitted, in briefs, a sum total of\r\n     225 closely printed pages, in which they have clearly, yet,\r\n     almost to a mathematical certainty, demonstrated on the one\r\n     side that this Schrader machine is new and patentable, and\r\n     on the other that it is old and not so. Under these\r\n     circumstances, it would be unnecessary labor and a fruitless\r\n     task for me to enter into any further technical discussion\r\n     of the mechanical problems involved, for the purpose of\r\n     seeking to convince either side of its error. In cases of\r\n     such perplexity as this generally some incidents appear that\r\n     speak more unerringly than do the tongues of the witnesses,\r\n     and to some of these I purpose to now refer.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard Shaw, the distinguished English author, has given a most\r\nvivid and amusing picture of this introduction of Edison's telephone\r\ninto England, describing the apparatus as \"a much too ingenious\r\ninvention, being nothing less than a telephone of such stentorian\r\nefficiency that it bellowed your most private communications all over\r\nthe house, instead of whispering them with some sort of discretion.\"\r\nShaw, as a young man, was employed by the Edison Telephone Company,\r\nand was very much alive to his surroundings, often assisting in public\r\ndemonstrations of the apparatus \"in a manner which I am persuaded laid\r\nthe foundation of Mr. Edison's reputation.\" The sketch of the men sent\r\nover from America is graphic: \"Whilst the Edison Telephone Company\r\nlasted it crowded the basement of a high pile of offices in Queen\r\nVictoria Street with American artificers. These deluded and romantic men\r\ngave me a glimpse of the skilled proletariat of the United States. They\r\nsang obsolete sentimental songs with genuine emotion; and their language\r\nwas frightful even to an Irishman. They worked with a ferocious\r\nenergy which was out of all proportion to the actual result achieved.\r\nIndomitably resolved to assert their republican manhood by taking no\r\norders from a tall-hatted Englishman whose stiff politeness covered\r\nhis conviction that they were relatively to himself inferior and common\r\npersons, they insisted on being slave-driven with genuine American oaths\r\nby a genuine free and equal American foreman. They utterly despised the\r\nartfully slow British workman, who did as little for his wages as he\r\npossibly could; never hurried himself; and had a deep reverence for one\r\nwhose pocket could be tapped by respectful behavior. Need I add that\r\nthey were contemptuously wondered at by this same British workman as\r\na parcel of outlandish adult boys who sweated themselves for their\r\nemployer's benefit instead of looking after their own interest? They\r\nadored Mr. Edison as the greatest man of all time in every possible\r\ndepartment of science, art, and philosophy, and execrated Mr. Graham\r\nBell, the inventor of the rival telephone, as his Satanic adversary;\r\nbut each of them had (or intended to have) on the brink of completion\r\nan improvement on the telephone, usually a new transmitter. They were\r\nfree-souled creatures, excellent company, sensitive, cheerful, and\r\nprofane; liars, braggarts, and hustlers, with an air of making slow old\r\nEngland hum, which never left them even when, as often happened, they\r\nwere wrestling with difficulties of their own making, or struggling in\r\nno-thoroughfares, from which they had to be retrieved like stray sheep\r\nby Englishmen without imagination enough to go wrong.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Insull, who afterward became private secretary to Mr. Edison,\r\nand a leader in the development of American electrical manufacturing\r\nand the central-station art, was also in close touch with the London\r\nsituation thus depicted, being at the time private secretary to Colonel\r\nGouraud, and acting for the first half hour as the amateur telephone\r\noperator in the first experimental exchange erected in Europe. He\r\ntook notes of an early meeting where the affairs of the company were\r\ndiscussed by leading men like Sir John Lubbock (Lord Avebury) and the\r\nRight Hon. E. P. Bouverie (then a cabinet minister), none of whom\r\ncould see in the telephone much more than an auxiliary for getting\r\nout promptly in the next morning's papers the midnight debates in\r\nParliament. \"I remember another incident,\" says Mr. Insull. \"It was at\r\nsome celebration of one of the Royal Societies at the Burlington House,\r\nPiccadilly. We had a telephone line running across the roofs to the\r\nbasement of the building. I think it was to Tyndall's laboratory in\r\nBurlington Street. As the ladies and gentlemen came through, they\r\nnaturally wanted to look at the great curiosity, the loud-speaking\r\ntelephone: in fact, any telephone was a curiosity then. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGladstone came through. I was handling the telephone at the Burlington\r\nHouse end. Mrs. Gladstone asked the man over the telephone whether he\r\nknew if a man or woman was speaking; and the reply came in quite loud\r\ntones that it was a man!\"\r\n\r\nWith Mr. E. H. Johnson, who represented Edison, there went to England\r\nfor the furtherance of this telephone enterprise, Mr. Charles Edison,\r\na nephew of the inventor. He died in Paris, October, 1879, not twenty\r\nyears of age. Stimulated by the example of his uncle, this brilliant\r\nyouth had already made a mark for himself as a student and inventor,\r\nand when only eighteen he secured in open competition the contract to\r\ninstall a complete fire-alarm telegraph system for Port Huron. A few\r\nmonths later he was eagerly welcomed by his uncle at Menlo Park,\r\nand after working on the telephone was sent to London to aid in its\r\nintroduction. There he made the acquaintance of Professor Tyndall,\r\nexhibited the telephone to the late King of England; and also won the\r\nfriendship of the late King of the Belgians, with whom he took up the\r\nproject of establishing telephonic communication between Belgium and\r\nEngland. At the time of his premature death he was engaged in installing\r\nthe Edison quadruplex between Brussels and Paris, being one of the very\r\nfew persons then in Europe familiar with the working of that invention.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the telephonic art in America was undergoing very rapid\r\ndevelopment. In March, 1878, addressing \"the capitalists of the Electric\r\nTelephone Company\" on the future of his invention, Bell outlined with\r\nprophetic foresight and remarkable clearness the coming of the modern\r\ntelephone exchange. Comparing with gas and water distribution, he said:\r\n\"In a similar manner, it is conceivable that cables of telephone wires\r\ncould be laid underground or suspended overhead communicating by branch\r\nwires with private dwellings, country houses, shops, manufactories,\r\netc., uniting them through the main cable with a central office,\r\nwhere the wire could be connected as desired, establishing direct\r\ncommunication between any two places in the city.... Not only so, but I\r\nbelieve, in the future, wires will unite the head offices of telephone\r\ncompanies in different cities; and a man in one part of the country may\r\ncommunicate by word of mouth with another in a distant place.\"\r\n\r\nAll of which has come to pass. Professor Bell also suggested how this\r\ncould be done by \"the employ of a man in each central office for the\r\npurpose of connecting the wires as directed.\" He also indicated the two\r\nmethods of telephonic tariff--a fixed rental and a toll; and mentioned\r\nthe practice, now in use on long-distance lines, of a time charge. As\r\na matter of fact, this \"centralizing\" was attempted in May, 1877, in\r\nBoston, with the circuits of the Holmes burglar-alarm system, four\r\nbanking-houses being thus interconnected; while in January of 1878 the\r\nBell telephone central-office system at New Haven, Connecticut, was\r\nopened for business, \"the first fully equipped commercial telephone\r\nexchange ever established for public or general service.\"\r\n\r\nAll through this formative period Bell had adhered to and introduced the\r\nmagneto form of telephone, now used only as a receiver, and very poorly\r\nadapted for the vital function of a speech-transmitter. From August,\r\n1877, the Western Union Telegraph Company worked along the other line,\r\nand in 1878, with its allied Gold & Stock Telegraph Company, it brought\r\ninto existence the American Speaking Telephone Company to introduce\r\nthe Edison apparatus, and to create telephone exchanges all over the\r\ncountry. In this warfare, the possession of a good battery transmitter\r\ncounted very heavily in favor of the Western Union, for upon that the\r\nreal expansion of the whole industry depended; but in a few months\r\nthe Bell system had its battery transmitter, too, tending to equalize\r\nmatters. Late in the same year patent litigation was begun which brought\r\nout clearly the merits of Bell, through his patent, as the original and\r\nfirst inventor of the electric speaking telephone; and the Western Union\r\nTelegraph Company made terms with its rival. A famous contract bearing\r\ndate of November 10, 1879, showed that under the Edison and other\r\ncontrolling patents the Western Union Company had already set going some\r\neighty-five exchanges, and was making large quantities of telephonic\r\napparatus. In return for its voluntary retirement from the telephonic\r\nfield, the Western Union Telegraph Company, under this contract,\r\nreceived a royalty of 20 per cent. of all the telephone earnings of the\r\nBell system while the Bell patents ran; and thus came to enjoy an annual\r\nincome of several hundred thousand dollars for some years, based chiefly\r\non its modest investment in Edison's work. It was also paid several\r\nthousand dollars in cash for the Edison, Phelps, Gray, and other\r\napparatus on hand. It secured further 40 per cent. of the stock of the\r\nlocal telephone systems of New York and Chicago; and last, but by no\r\nmeans least, it exacted from the Bell interests an agreement to stay out\r\nof the telegraph field.\r\n\r\nBy March, 1881, there were in the United States only nine cities of\r\nmore than ten thousand inhabitants, and only one of more than fifteen\r\nthousand, without a telephone exchange. The industry thrived under\r\ncompetition, and the absence of it now had a decided effect in checking\r\ngrowth; for when the Bell patent expired in 1893, the total of telephone\r\nsets in operation in the United States was only 291,253. To quote from\r\nan official Bell statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The brief but vigorous Western Union competition was a kind of blessing\r\nin disguise. The very fact that two distinct interests were actively\r\nengaged in the work of organizing and establishing competing telephone\r\nexchanges all over the country, greatly facilitated the spread of the\r\nidea and the growth of the business, and familiarized the people with\r\nthe use of the telephone as a business agency; while the keenness of the\r\ncompetition, extending to the agents and employees of both companies,\r\nbrought about a swift but quite unforeseen and unlooked-for expansion\r\nin the individual exchanges of the larger cities, and a corresponding\r\nadvance in their importance, value, and usefulness.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of this was immediately shown in 1894, after the Bell patents\r\nhad expired, by the tremendous outburst of new competitive activity, in\r\n\"independent\" country systems and toll lines through sparsely settled\r\ndistricts--work for which the Edison apparatus and methods were\r\npeculiarly adapted, yet against which the influence of the Edison patent\r\nwas invoked. The data secured by the United States Census Office in 1902\r\nshowed that the whole industry had made gigantic leaps in eight years,\r\nand had 2,371,044 telephone stations in service, of which 1,053,866\r\nwere wholly or nominally independent of the Bell. By 1907 an even\r\nmore notable increase was shown, and the Census figures for that year\r\nincluded no fewer than 6,118,578 stations, of which 1,986,575 were\r\n\"independent.\" These six million instruments every single set employing\r\nthe principle of the carbon transmitter--were grouped into 15,527 public\r\nexchanges, in the very manner predicted by Bell thirty years before,\r\nand they gave service in the shape of over eleven billions of talks. The\r\noutstanding capitalized value of the plant was $814,616,004, the income\r\nfor the year was nearly $185,000,000, and the people employed were\r\n140,000. If Edison had done nothing else, his share in the creation\r\nof such an industry would have entitled him to a high place among\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\nThis chapter is of necessity brief in its reference to many extremely\r\ninteresting points and details; and to some readers it may seem\r\nincomplete in its references to the work of other men than Edison, whose\r\ninfluence on telephony as an art has also been considerable. In reply to\r\nthis pertinent criticism, it may be pointed out that this is a life of\r\nEdison, and not of any one else; and that even the discussion of his\r\nachievements alone in these various fields requires more space than the\r\nauthors have at their disposal. The attempt has been made, however,\r\nto indicate the course of events and deal fairly with the facts. The\r\ncontroversy that once waged with great excitement over the invention\r\nof the microphone, but has long since died away, is suggestive of the\r\ndifficulties involved in trying to do justice to everybody. A standard\r\nhistory describes the microphone thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A form of apparatus produced during the early days of the telephone\r\nby Professor Hughes, of England, for the purpose of rendering faint,\r\nindistinct sounds distinctly audible, depended for its operation on the\r\nchanges that result in the resistance of loose contacts. This apparatus\r\nwas called the microphone, and was in reality but one of the many forms\r\nthat it is possible to give to the telephone transmitter. For example,\r\nthe Edison granular transmitter was a variety of microphone, as was also\r\nEdison's transmitter, in which the solid button of carbon was employed.\r\nIndeed, even the platinum point, which in the early form of the Reis\r\ntransmitter pressed against the platinum contact cemented to the centre\r\nof the diaphragm, was a microphone.\"\r\n\r\nAt a time when most people were amazed at the idea of hearing, with\r\nthe aid of a \"microphone,\" a fly walk at a distance of many miles, the\r\npriority of invention of such a device was hotly disputed. Yet without\r\ndesiring to take anything from the credit of the brilliant American,\r\nHughes, whose telegraphic apparatus is still in use all over Europe, it\r\nmay be pointed out that this passage gives Edison the attribution of at\r\nleast two original forms of which those suggested by Hughes were mere\r\nvariations and modifications. With regard to this matter, Mr. Edison\r\nhimself remarks: \"After I sent one of my men over to London especially,\r\nto show Preece the carbon transmitter, and where Hughes first saw it,\r\nand heard it--then within a month he came out with the microphone,\r\nwithout any acknowledgment whatever. Published dates will show that\r\nHughes came along after me.\"\r\n\r\nThere have been other ways also in which Edison has utilized the\r\npeculiar property that carbon possesses of altering its resistance\r\nto the passage of current, according to the pressure to which it is\r\nsubjected, whether at the surface, or through closer union of the\r\nmass. A loose road with a few inches of dust or pebbles on it offers\r\nappreciable resistance to the wheels of vehicles travelling over it; but\r\nif the surface is kept hard and smooth the effect is quite different.\r\nIn the same way carbon, whether solid or in the shape of finely divided\r\npowder, offers a high resistance to the passage of electricity; but\r\nif the carbon is squeezed together the conditions change, with less\r\nresistance to electricity in the circuit. For his quadruplex system,\r\nMr. Edison utilized this fact in the construction of a rheostat or\r\nresistance box. It consists of a series of silk disks saturated with a\r\nsizing of plumbago and well dried. The disks are compressed by means of\r\nan adjustable screw; and in this manner the resistance of a circuit can\r\nbe varied over a wide range.\r\n\r\nIn like manner Edison developed a \"pressure\" or carbon relay, adapted\r\nto the transference of signals of variable strength from one circuit to\r\nanother. An ordinary relay consists of an electromagnet inserted in the\r\nmain line for telegraphing, which brings a local battery and sounder\r\ncircuit into play, reproducing in the local circuit the signals sent\r\nover the main line. The relay is adjusted to the weaker currents likely\r\nto be received, but the signals reproduced on the sounder by the agency\r\nof the relay are, of course, all of equal strength, as they depend upon\r\nthe local battery, which has only this steady work to perform. In cases\r\nwhere it is desirable to reproduce the signals in the local circuit with\r\nthe same variations in strength as they are received by the relay,\r\nthe Edison carbon pressure relay does the work. The poles of the\r\nelectromagnet in the local circuit are hollowed out and filled up with\r\ncarbon disks or powdered plumbago. The armature and the carbon-tipped\r\npoles of the electromagnet form part of the local circuit; and if the\r\nrelay is actuated by a weak current the armature will be attracted\r\nbut feebly. The carbon being only slightly compressed will offer\r\nconsiderable resistance to the flow of current from the local battery,\r\nand therefore the signal on the local sounder will be weak. If, on the\r\ncontrary, the incoming current on the main line be strong, the armature\r\nwill be strongly attracted, the carbon will be sharply compressed, the\r\nresistance in the local circuit will be proportionately lowered, and the\r\nsignal heard on the local sounder will be a loud one. Thus it will be\r\nseen, by another clever juggle with the willing agent, carbon, for which\r\nhe has found so many duties, Edison is able to transfer or transmit\r\nexactly, to the local circuit, the main-line current in all its minutest\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nIn his researches to determine the nature of the motograph phenomena,\r\nand to open up other sources of electrical current generation, Edison\r\nhas worked out a very ingenious and somewhat perplexing piece of\r\napparatus known as the \"chalk battery.\" It consists of a series of chalk\r\ncylinders mounted on a shaft revolved by hand. Resting against each of\r\nthese cylinders is a palladium-faced spring, and similar springs make\r\ncontact with the shaft between each cylinder. By connecting all these\r\nsprings in circuit with a galvanometer and revolving the shaft rapidly,\r\na notable deflection is obtained of the galvanometer needle, indicating\r\nthe production of electrical energy. The reason for this does not appear\r\nto have been determined.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, in this beautiful and ingenious series, comes the\r\n\"tasimeter,\" an instrument of most delicate sensibility in the presence\r\nof heat. The name is derived from the Greek, the use of the apparatus\r\nbeing primarily to measure extremely minute differences of pressure.\r\nA strip of hard rubber with pointed ends rests perpendicularly on a\r\nplatinum plate, beneath which is a carbon button, under which again lies\r\nanother platinum plate. The two plates and the carbon button form part\r\nof an electric circuit containing a battery and a galvanometer. The\r\nhard-rubber strip is exceedingly sensitive to heat. The slightest degree\r\nof heat imparted to it causes it to expand invisibly, thus increasing\r\nthe pressure contact on the carbon button and producing a variation\r\nin the resistance of the circuit, registered immediately by the little\r\nswinging needle of the galvanometer. The instrument is so sensitive that\r\nwith a delicate galvanometer it will show the impingement of the heat\r\nfrom a person's hand thirty feet away. The suggestion to employ such\r\nan apparatus in astronomical observations occurs at once, and it may\r\nbe noted that in one instance the heat of rays of light from the remote\r\nstar Arcturus gave results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE PHONOGRAPH\r\n\r\nAT the opening of the Electrical Show in New York City in October, 1908,\r\nto celebrate the jubilee of the Atlantic Cable and the first quarter\r\ncentury of lighting with the Edison service on Manhattan Island, the\r\nexercises were all conducted by means of the Edison phonograph. This\r\nincluded the dedicatory speech of Governor Hughes, of New York; the\r\nmodest remarks of Mr. Edison, as president; the congratulations of the\r\npresidents of several national electric bodies, and a number of vocal\r\nand instrumental selections of operatic nature. All this was heard\r\nclearly by a very large audience, and was repeated on other evenings.\r\nThe same speeches were used again phonographically at the Electrical\r\nShow in Chicago in 1909--and now the records are preserved for\r\nreproduction a hundred or a thousand years hence. This tour de force,\r\nnever attempted before, was merely an exemplification of the value\r\nof the phonograph not only in establishing at first hand the facts of\r\nhistory, but in preserving the human voice. What would we not give to\r\nlisten to the very accents and tones of the Sermon on the Mount, the\r\norations of Demosthenes, the first Pitt's appeal for American liberty,\r\nthe Farewell of Washington, or the Address at Gettysburg? Until Edison\r\nmade his wonderful invention in 1877, the human race was entirely\r\nwithout means for preserving or passing on to posterity its own\r\nlinguistic utterances or any other vocal sound. We have some idea how\r\nthe ancients looked and felt and wrote; the abundant evidence takes us\r\nback to the cave-dwellers. But all the old languages are dead, and the\r\nliterary form is their embalmment. We do not even know definitely how\r\nShakespeare's and Goldsmith's plays were pronounced on the stage in\r\nthe theatres of the time; while it is only a guess that perhaps Chaucer\r\nwould sound much more modern than he scans.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of sound, which owes so much to Helmholtz, was one step\r\ntoward recording; and the various means of illustrating the phenomena of\r\nsound to the eye and ear, prior to the phonograph, were all ingenious.\r\nOne can watch the dancing little flames of Koenig, and see a voice\r\nexpressed in tongues of fire; but the record can only be photographic.\r\nIn like manner, the simple phonautograph of Leon Scott, invented about\r\n1858, records on a revolving cylinder of blackened paper the sound\r\nvibrations transmitted through a membrane to which a tiny stylus is\r\nattached; so that a human mouth uses a pen and inscribes its sign vocal.\r\nYet after all we are just as far away as ever from enabling the young\r\nactors at Harvard to give Aristophanes with all the true, subtle\r\nintonation and inflection of the Athens of 400 B.C. The instrument\r\nis dumb. Ingenuity has been shown also in the invention of\r\n\"talking-machines,\" like Faber's, based on the reed organ pipe. These\r\nautomata can be made by dexterous manipulation to jabber a little, like\r\na doll with its monotonous \"ma-ma,\" or a cuckoo clock; but they lack\r\neven the sterile utility of the imitative art of ventriloquism. The real\r\ngreat invention lies in creating devices that shall be able to evoke\r\nfrom tinfoil, wax, or composition at any time to-day or in the future\r\nthe sound that once was as evanescent as the vibrations it made on the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nContrary to the general notion, very few of the great modern inventions\r\nhave been the result of a sudden inspiration by which, Minerva-like,\r\nthey have sprung full-fledged from their creators' brain; but, on the\r\ncontrary, they have been evolved by slow and gradual steps, so that\r\nfrequently the final advance has been often almost imperceptible. The\r\nEdison phonograph is an important exception to the general rule; not,\r\nof course, the phonograph of the present day with all of its mechanical\r\nperfection, but as an instrument capable of recording and reproducing\r\nsound. Its invention has been frequently attributed to the discovery\r\nthat a point attached to a telephone diaphragm would, under the effect\r\nof sound-waves, vibrate with sufficient force to prick the finger. The\r\nstory, though interesting, is not founded on fact; but, if true, it is\r\ndifficult to see how the discovery in question could have contributed\r\nmaterially to the ultimate accomplishment. To a man of Edison's\r\nperception it is absurd to suppose that the effect of the so-called\r\ndiscovery would not have been made as a matter of deduction long\r\nbefore the physical sensation was experienced. As a matter of fact, the\r\ninvention of the phonograph was the result of pure reason. Some time\r\nprior to 1877, Edison had been experimenting on an automatic telegraph\r\nin which the letters were formed by embossing strips of paper with the\r\nproper arrangement of dots and dashes. By drawing this strip beneath a\r\ncontact lever, the latter was actuated so as to control the circuits and\r\nsend the desired signals over the line. It was observed that when the\r\nstrip was moved very rapidly the vibration of the lever resulted in\r\nthe production of an audible note. With these facts before him, Edison\r\nreasoned that if the paper strip could be imprinted with elevations\r\nand depressions representative of sound-waves, they might be caused to\r\nactuate a diaphragm so as to reproduce the corresponding sounds.\r\nThe next step in the line of development was to form the necessary\r\nundulations on the strip, and it was then reasoned that original sounds\r\nthemselves might be utilized to form a graphic record by actuating a\r\ndiaphragm and causing a cutting or indenting point carried thereby to\r\nvibrate in contact with a moving surface, so as to cut or indent the\r\nrecord therein. Strange as it may seem, therefore, and contrary to the\r\ngeneral belief, the phonograph was developed backward, the production of\r\nthe sounds being of prior development to the idea of actually recording\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison's own account of the invention of the phonograph is intensely\r\ninteresting. \"I was experimenting,\" he says, \"on an automatic method\r\nof recording telegraph messages on a disk of paper laid on a revolving\r\nplaten, exactly the same as the disk talking-machine of to-day. The\r\nplaten had a spiral groove on its surface, like the disk. Over this was\r\nplaced a circular disk of paper; an electromagnet with the embossing\r\npoint connected to an arm travelled over the disk; and any signals given\r\nthrough the magnets were embossed on the disk of paper. If this disk was\r\nremoved from the machine and put on a similar machine provided with\r\na contact point, the embossed record would cause the signals to be\r\nrepeated into another wire. The ordinary speed of telegraphic signals\r\nis thirty-five to forty words a minute; but with this machine several\r\nhundred words were possible.\r\n\r\n\"From my experiments on the telephone I knew of the power of a diaphragm\r\nto take up sound vibrations, as I had made a little toy which, when\r\nyou recited loudly in the funnel, would work a pawl connected to the\r\ndiaphragm; and this engaging a ratchet-wheel served to give continuous\r\nrotation to a pulley. This pulley was connected by a cord to a little\r\npaper toy representing a man sawing wood. Hence, if one shouted: 'Mary\r\nhad a little lamb,' etc., the paper man would start sawing wood. I\r\nreached the conclusion that if I could record the movements of the\r\ndiaphragm properly, I could cause such record to reproduce the original\r\nmovements imparted to the diaphragm by the voice, and thus succeed in\r\nrecording and reproducing the human voice.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of using a disk I designed a little machine using a cylinder\r\nprovided with grooves around the surface. Over this was to be placed\r\ntinfoil, which easily received and recorded the movements of the\r\ndiaphragm. A sketch was made, and the piece-work price, $18, was marked\r\non the sketch. I was in the habit of marking the price I would pay on\r\neach sketch. If the workman lost, I would pay his regular wages; if he\r\nmade more than the wages, he kept it. The workman who got the sketch was\r\nJohn Kruesi. I didn't have much faith that it would work, expecting that\r\nI might possibly hear a word or so that would give hope of a future for\r\nthe idea. Kruesi, when he had nearly finished it, asked what it was for.\r\nI told him I was going to record talking, and then have the machine talk\r\nback. He thought it absurd. However, it was finished, the foil was\r\nput on; I then shouted 'Mary had a little lamb,' etc. I adjusted the\r\nreproducer, and the machine reproduced it perfectly. I was never so\r\ntaken aback in my life. Everybody was astonished. I was always afraid\r\nof things that worked the first time. Long experience proved that\r\nthere were great drawbacks found generally before they could be got\r\ncommercial; but here was something there was no doubt of.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder that honest John Kruesi, as he stood and listened to the\r\nmarvellous performance of the simple little machine he had himself just\r\nfinished, ejaculated in an awe-stricken tone: \"Mein Gott im Himmel!\" And\r\nyet he had already seen Edison do a few clever things. No wonder they\r\nsat up all night fixing and adjusting it so as to get better and better\r\nresults--reciting and singing, trying each other's voices, and then\r\nlistening with involuntary awe as the words came back again and again,\r\njust as long as they were willing to revolve the little cylinder with\r\nits dotted spiral indentations in the tinfoil under the vibrating stylus\r\nof the reproducing diaphragm. It took a little time to acquire the knack\r\nof turning the crank steadily while leaning over the recorder to talk\r\ninto the machine; and there was some deftness required also in fastening\r\ndown the tinfoil on the cylinder where it was held by a pin running in\r\na longitudinal slot. Paraffined paper appears also to have been\r\nexperimented with as an impressible material. It is said that Carman,\r\nthe foreman of the machine shop, had gone the length of wagering Edison\r\na box of cigars that the device would not work. All the world knows that\r\nhe lost.\r\n\r\nThe original Edison phonograph thus built by Kruesi is preserved in the\r\nSouth Kensington Museum, London. That repository can certainly have no\r\ngreater treasure of its kind. But as to its immediate use, the inventor\r\nsays: \"That morning I took it over to New York and walked into the\r\noffice of the Scientific American, went up to Mr. Beach's desk, and said\r\nI had something to show him. He asked what it was. I told him I had a\r\nmachine that would record and reproduce the human voice. I opened the\r\npackage, set up the machine and recited, 'Mary had a little lamb,' etc.\r\nThen I reproduced it so that it could be heard all over the room. They\r\nkept me at it until the crowd got so great Mr. Beach was afraid the\r\nfloor would collapse; and we were compelled to stop. The papers next\r\nmorning contained columns. None of the writers seemed to understand how\r\nit was done. I tried to explain, it was so very simple, but the results\r\nwere so surprising they made up their minds probably that they never\r\nwould understand it--and they didn't.\r\n\r\n\"I started immediately making several larger and better machines, which\r\nI exhibited at Menlo Park to crowds. The Pennsylvania Railroad ran\r\nspecial trains. Washington people telegraphed me to come on. I took\r\na phonograph to Washington and exhibited it in the room of James G.\r\nBlaine's niece (Gail Hamilton); and members of Congress and notable\r\npeople of that city came all day long until late in the evening. I made\r\none break. I recited 'Mary,' etc., and another ditty:\r\n\r\n     'There was a little girl, who had a little curl\r\n     Right in the middle of her forehead;\r\n     And when she was good she was very, very good,\r\n     But when she was bad she was horrid.'\r\n\r\n\"It will be remembered that Senator Roscoe Conkling, then very prominent,\r\nhad a curl of hair on his forehead; and all the caricaturists developed\r\nit abnormally. He was very sensitive about the subject. When he came in\r\nhe was introduced; but being rather deaf, I didn't catch his name, but\r\nsat down and started the curl ditty. Everybody tittered, and I was told\r\nthat Mr. Conkling was displeased. About 11 o'clock at night word was\r\nreceived from President Hayes that he would be very much pleased if I\r\nwould come up to the White House. I was taken there, and found Mr. Hayes\r\nand several others waiting. Among them I remember Carl Schurz, who was\r\nplaying the piano when I entered the room. The exhibition continued till\r\nabout 12.30 A.M., when Mrs. Hayes and several other ladies, who had been\r\ninduced to get up and dress, appeared. I left at 3.30 A.M.\r\n\r\n\"For a long time some people thought there was trickery. One morning\r\nat Menlo Park a gentleman came to the laboratory and asked to see the\r\nphonograph. It was Bishop Vincent, who helped Lewis Miller found the\r\nChautauqua I exhibited it, and then he asked if he could speak a few\r\nwords. I put on a fresh foil and told him to go ahead. He commenced to\r\nrecite Biblical names with immense rapidity. On reproducing it he said:\r\n'I am satisfied, now. There isn't a man in the United States who could\r\nrecite those names with the same rapidity.'\"\r\n\r\nThe phonograph was now fairly launched as a world sensation, and a\r\nreference to the newspapers of 1878 will show the extent to which it and\r\nEdison were themes of universal discussion. Some of the press notices\r\nof the period were most amazing--and amusing. As though the real\r\nachievements of this young man, barely thirty, were not tangible\r\nand solid enough to justify admiration of his genius, the \"yellow\r\njournalists\" of the period began busily to create an \"Edison myth,\" with\r\ngross absurdities of assertion and attribution from which the modest\r\nsubject of it all has not yet ceased to suffer with unthinking people.\r\nA brilliantly vicious example of this method of treatment is to be found\r\nin the Paris Figaro of that year, which under the appropriate title of\r\n\"This Astounding Eddison\" lay bare before the French public the most\r\nstartling revelations as to the inventor's life and character. \"It\r\nshould be understood,\" said this journal, \"that Mr. Eddison does not\r\nbelong to himself. He is the property of the telegraph company which\r\nlodges him in New York at a superb hotel; keeps him on a luxurious\r\nfooting, and pays him a formidable salary so as to be the one to know\r\nof and profit by his discoveries. The company has, in the dwelling of\r\nEddison, men in its employ who do not quit him for a moment, at the\r\ntable, on the street, in the laboratory. So that this wretched man,\r\nwatched more closely than ever was any malefactor, cannot even give a\r\nmoment's thought to his own private affairs without one of his guards\r\nasking him what he is thinking about.\" This foolish \"blague\" was\r\naccompanied by a description of Edison's new \"aerophone,\" a steam\r\nmachine which carried the voice a distance of one and a half miles. \"You\r\nspeak to a jet of vapor. A friend previously advised can answer you\r\nby the same method.\" Nor were American journals backward in this wild\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\nThe furor had its effect in stimulating a desire everywhere on the\r\npart of everybody to see and hear the phonograph. A small commercial\r\norganization was formed to build and exploit the apparatus, and the\r\nshops at Menlo Park laboratory were assisted by the little Bergmann shop\r\nin New York. Offices were taken for the new enterprise at 203 Broadway,\r\nwhere the Mail and Express building now stands, and where, in a\r\ngeneral way, under the auspices of a talented dwarf, C. A. Cheever, the\r\nembryonic phonograph and the crude telephone shared rooms and expenses.\r\nGardiner G. Hubbard, father-in-law of Alex. Graham Bell, was one of the\r\nstockholders in the Phonograph Company, which paid Edison $10,000 cash\r\nand a 20 per cent. royalty. This curious partnership was maintained for\r\nsome time, even when the Bell Telephone offices were removed to Reade\r\nStreet, New York, whither the phonograph went also; and was perhaps\r\nexplained by the fact that just then the ability of the phonograph as\r\na money-maker was much more easily demonstrated than was that of\r\nthe telephone, still in its short range magneto stage and awaiting\r\ndevelopment with the aid of the carbon transmitter.\r\n\r\nThe earning capacity of the phonograph then, as largely now, lay in its\r\nexhibition qualities. The royalties from Boston, ever intellectually\r\nawake and ready for something new, ran as high as $1800 a week. In New\r\nYork there was a ceaseless demand for it, and with the aid of Hilbourne\r\nL. Roosevelt, a famous organ builder, and uncle of ex-President\r\nRoosevelt, concerts were given at which the phonograph was \"featured.\"\r\nTo manage this novel show business the services of James Redpath were\r\ncalled into requisition with great success. Redpath, famous as a friend\r\nand biographer of John Brown, as a Civil War correspondent, and as\r\nfounder of the celebrated Redpath Lyceum Bureau in Boston, divided\r\nthe country into territories, each section being leased for exhibition\r\npurposes on a basis of a percentage of the \"gate money.\" To 203\r\nBroadway from all over the Union flocked a swarm of showmen, cranks, and\r\nparticularly of old operators, who, the seedier they were in appearance,\r\nthe more insistent they were that \"Tom\" should give them, for the sake\r\nof \"Auld lang syne,\" this chance to make a fortune for him and for\r\nthemselves. At the top of the building was a floor on which these\r\nnovices were graduated in the use and care of the machine, and then,\r\nwith an equipment of tinfoil and other supplies, they were sent out on\r\nthe road. It was a diverting experience while it lasted. The excitement\r\nover the phonograph was maintained for many months, until a large\r\nproportion of the inhabitants of the country had seen it; and then the\r\nshow receipts declined and dwindled away. Many of the old operators,\r\ntaken on out of good-nature, were poor exhibitors and worse accountants,\r\nand at last they and the machines with which they had been intrusted\r\nfaded from sight. But in the mean time Edison had learned many lessons\r\nas to this practical side of development that were not forgotten when\r\nthe renascence of the phonograph began a few years later, leading up to\r\nthe present enormous and steady demand for both machines and records.\r\n\r\nIt deserves to be pointed out that the phonograph has changed little in\r\nthe intervening years from the first crude instruments of 1877-78. It\r\nhas simply been refined and made more perfect in a mechanical sense.\r\nEdison was immensely impressed with its possibilities, and greatly\r\ninclined to work upon it, but the coming of the electric light compelled\r\nhim to throw all his energies for a time into the vast new field\r\nawaiting conquest. The original phonograph, as briefly noted above, was\r\nrotated by hand, and the cylinder was fed slowly longitudinally by means\r\nof a nut engaging a screw thread on the cylinder shaft. Wrapped\r\naround the cylinder was a sheet of tinfoil, with which engaged a small\r\nchisel-like recording needle, connected adhesively with the centre of\r\nan iron diaphragm. Obviously, as the cylinder was turned, the needle\r\nfollowed a spiral path whose pitch depended upon that of the feed screw.\r\nAlong this path a thread was cut in the cylinder so as to permit the\r\nneedle to indent the foil readily as the diaphragm vibrated. By rotating\r\nthe cylinder and by causing the diaphragm to vibrate under the effect\r\nof vocal or musical sounds, the needle-like point would form a series\r\nof indentations in the foil corresponding to and characteristic of the\r\nsound-waves. By now engaging the point with the beginning of the grooved\r\nrecord so formed, and by again rotating the cylinder, the undulations of\r\nthe record would cause the needle and its attached diaphragm to vibrate\r\nso as to effect the reproduction. Such an apparatus was necessarily\r\nundeveloped, and was interesting only from a scientific point of view.\r\nIt had many mechanical defects which prevented its use as a practical\r\napparatus. Since the cylinder was rotated by hand, the speed at which\r\nthe record was formed would vary considerably, even with the same\r\nmanipulator, so that it would have been impossible to record and\r\nreproduce music satisfactorily; in doing which exact uniformity of\r\nspeed is essential. The formation of the record in tinfoil was also\r\nobjectionable from a practical standpoint, since such a record was faint\r\nand would be substantially obliterated after two or three reproductions.\r\nFurthermore, the foil could not be easily removed from and replaced\r\nupon the instrument, and consequently the reproduction had to follow the\r\nrecording immediately, and the successive tinfoils were thrown away. The\r\ninstrument was also heavy and bulky. Notwithstanding these objections\r\nthe original phonograph created, as already remarked, an enormous\r\npopular excitement, and the exhibitions were considered by many\r\nsceptical persons as nothing more than clever ventriloquism. The\r\npossibilities of the instrument as a commercial apparatus were\r\nrecognized from the very first, and some of the fields in which it was\r\npredicted that the phonograph would be used are now fully occupied.\r\nSome have not yet been realized. Writing in 1878 in the North\r\nAmerican-Review, Mr. Edison thus summed up his own ideas as to the\r\nfuture applications of the new invention:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Among the many uses to which the phonograph will be applied are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. Letter writing and all kinds of dictation without the aid of a\r\nstenographer.\r\n\r\n2. Phonographic books, which will speak to blind people without effort\r\non their part.\r\n\r\n3. The teaching of elocution.\r\n\r\n4. Reproduction of music.\r\n\r\n5. The 'Family Record'--a registry of sayings, reminiscences, etc., by\r\nmembers of a family in their own voices, and of the last words of dying\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n6. Music-boxes and toys.\r\n\r\n7. Clocks that should announce in articulate speech the time for going\r\nhome, going to meals, etc.\r\n\r\n8. The preservation of languages by exact reproduction of the manner of\r\npronouncing.\r\n\r\n9. Educational purposes; such as preserving the explanations made by a\r\nteacher, so that the pupil can refer to them at any moment, and\r\nspelling or other lessons placed upon the phonograph for convenience in\r\ncommitting to memory.\r\n\r\n10. Connection with the telephone, so as to make that instrument an\r\nauxiliary in the transmission of permanent and invaluable records,\r\ninstead of being the recipient of momentary and fleeting communication.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the above fields of usefulness in which it was expected that\r\nthe phonograph might be applied, only three have been commercially\r\nrealized--namely, the reproduction of musical, including vaudeville or\r\ntalking selections, for which purpose a very large proportion of\r\nthe phonographs now made is used; the employment of the machine as a\r\nmechanical stenographer, which field has been taken up actively only\r\nwithin the past few years; and the utilization of the device for the\r\nteaching of languages, for which purpose it has been successfully\r\nemployed, for example, by the International Correspondence Schools of\r\nScranton, Pennsylvania, for several years. The other uses, however,\r\nwhich were early predicted for the phonograph have not as yet been\r\nworked out practically, although the time seems not far distant when its\r\ngeneral utility will be widely enlarged. Both dolls and clocks have been\r\nmade, but thus far the world has not taken them seriously.\r\n\r\nThe original phonograph, as invented by Edison, remained in its\r\ncrude and immature state for almost ten years--still the object of\r\nphilosophical interest, and as a convenient text-book illustration of\r\nthe effect of sound vibration. It continued to be a theme of curious\r\ninterest to the imaginative, and the subject of much fiction, while\r\nits neglected commercial possibilities were still more or less vaguely\r\nreferred to. During this period of arrested development, Edison was\r\ncontinuously working on the invention and commercial exploitation of\r\nthe incandescent lamp. In 1887 his time was comparatively free, and the\r\nphonograph was then taken up with renewed energy, and the effort made to\r\novercome its mechanical defects and to furnish a commercial instrument,\r\nso that its early promise might be realized. The important changes made\r\nfrom that time up to 1890 converted the phonograph from a scientific toy\r\ninto a successful industrial apparatus. The idea of forming the record\r\non tinfoil had been early abandoned, and in its stead was substituted a\r\ncylinder of wax-like material, in which the record was cut by a minute\r\nchisel-like gouging tool. Such a record or phonogram, as it was then\r\ncalled, could be removed from the machine or replaced at any time, many\r\nreproductions could be obtained without wearing out the record, and\r\nwhenever desired the record could be shaved off by a turning-tool so\r\nas to present a fresh surface on which a new record could be formed,\r\nsomething like an ancient palimpsest. A wax cylinder having walls less\r\nthan one-quarter of an inch in thickness could be used for receiving a\r\nlarge number of records, since the maximum depth of the record groove is\r\nhardly ever greater than one one-thousandth of an inch. Later on, and\r\nas the crowning achievement in the phonograph field, from a commercial\r\npoint of view, came the duplication of records to the extent of many\r\nthousands from a single \"master.\" This work was actively developed\r\nbetween the years 1890 and 1898, and its difficulties may be appreciated\r\nwhen the problem is stated; the copying from a single master of many\r\nmillions of excessively minute sound-waves having a maximum width of one\r\nhundredth of an inch, and a maximum depth of one thousandth of an\r\ninch, or less than the thickness of a sheet of tissue-paper. Among the\r\ninteresting developments of this process was the coating of the original\r\nor master record with a homogeneous film of gold so thin that three\r\nhundred thousand of these piled one on top of the other would present a\r\nthickness of only one inch!\r\n\r\nAnother important change was in the nature of a reversal of the original\r\narrangement, the cylinder or mandrel carrying the record being mounted\r\nin fixed bearings, and the recording or reproducing device being fed\r\nlengthwise, like the cutting-tool of a lathe, as the blank or record was\r\nrotated. It was early recognized that a single needle for forming the\r\nrecord and the reproduction therefrom was an undesirable arrangement,\r\nsince the formation of the record required a very sharp cutting-tool,\r\nwhile satisfactory and repeated reproduction suggested the use of a\r\nstylus which would result in the minimum wear. After many experiments\r\nand the production of a number of types of machines, the present\r\nrecorders and reproducers were evolved, the former consisting of a\r\nvery small cylindrical gouging tool having a diameter of about forty\r\nthousandths of an inch, and the latter a ball or button-shaped stylus\r\nwith a diameter of about thirty-five thousandths of an inch. By using\r\nan incisor of this sort, the record is formed of a series of connected\r\ngouges with rounded sides, varying in depth and width, and with which\r\nthe reproducer automatically engages and maintains its engagement.\r\nAnother difficulty encountered in the commercial development of the\r\nphonograph was the adjustment of the recording stylus so as to enter the\r\nwax-like surface to a very slight depth, and of the reproducer so as\r\nto engage exactly the record when formed. The earlier types of machines\r\nwere provided with separate screws for effecting these adjustments;\r\nbut considerable skill was required to obtain good results, and great\r\ndifficulty was experienced in meeting the variations in the wax-like\r\ncylinders, due to the warping under atmospheric changes. Consequently,\r\nwith the early types of commercial phonographs, it was first necessary\r\nto shave off the blank accurately before a record was formed thereon,\r\nin order that an absolutely true surface might be presented. To overcome\r\nthese troubles, the very ingenious suggestion was then made and adopted,\r\nof connecting the recording and reproducing styluses to their respective\r\ndiaphragms through the instrumentality of a compensating weight,\r\nwhich acted practically as a fixed support under the very rapid sound\r\nvibrations, but which yielded readily to distortions or variations\r\nin the wax-like cylinders. By reason of this improvement, it became\r\npossible to do away with all adjustments, the mass of the compensating\r\nweight causing the recorder to engage the blank automatically to the\r\nrequired depth, and to maintain the reproducing stylus always with the\r\ndesired pressure on the record when formed. These automatic adjustments\r\nwere maintained even though the blank or record might be so much out of\r\ntrue as an eighth of an inch, equal to more than two hundred times the\r\nmaximum depth of the record groove.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement that followed along the lines adopted by Edison for\r\nthe commercial development of the phonograph was making the recording\r\nand reproducing styluses of sapphire, an extremely hard, non-oxidizable\r\njewel, so that those tiny instruments would always retain their true\r\nform and effectively resist wear. Of course, in this work many other\r\nthings were done that may still be found on the perfected phonograph\r\nas it stands to-day, and many other suggestions were made which were\r\ncontemporaneously adopted, but which were later abandoned. For the\r\ncurious-minded, reference is made to the records in the Patent Office,\r\nwhich will show that up to 1893 Edison had obtained upward of sixty-five\r\npatents in this art, from which his line of thought can be very closely\r\ntraced. The phonograph of to-day, except for the perfection of its\r\nmechanical features, in its beauty of manufacture and design, and in\r\nsmall details, may be considered identical with the machine of 1889,\r\nwith the exception that with the latter the rotation of the record\r\ncylinder was effected by an electric motor.\r\n\r\nIts essential use as then contemplated was as a substitute for\r\nstenographers, and the most extravagant fancies were indulged in as to\r\nutility in that field. To exploit the device commercially, the patents\r\nwere sold to Philadelphia capitalists, who organized the North American\r\nPhonograph Company, through which leases for limited periods were\r\ngranted to local companies doing business in special territories,\r\ngenerally within the confines of a single State. Under that plan,\r\nresembling the methods of 1878, the machines and blank cylinders were\r\nmanufactured by the Edison Phonograph Works, which still retains its\r\nfactories at Orange, New Jersey. The marketing enterprise was early\r\ndoomed to failure, principally because the instruments were not well\r\nunderstood, and did not possess the necessary refinements that would fit\r\nthem for the special field in which they were to be used. At first the\r\ninstruments were leased; but it was found that the leases were seldom\r\nrenewed. Efforts were then made to sell them, but the prices were\r\nhigh--from $100 to $150. In the midst of these difficulties, the chief\r\npromoter of the enterprise, Mr. Lippincott, died; and it was soon found\r\nthat the roseate dreams of success entertained by the sanguine promoters\r\nwere not to be realized. The North American Phonograph Company failed,\r\nits principal creditor being Mr. Edison, who, having acquired the assets\r\nof the defunct concern, organized the National Phonograph Company, to\r\nwhich he turned over the patents; and with characteristic energy he\r\nattempted again to build up a business with which his favorite and, to\r\nhim, most interesting invention might be successfully identified. The\r\nNational Phonograph Company from the very start determined to retire at\r\nleast temporarily from the field of stenographic use, and to exploit the\r\nphonograph for musical purposes as a competitor of the music-box. Hence\r\nit was necessary that for such work the relatively heavy and expensive\r\nelectric motor should be discarded, and a simple spring motor\r\nconstructed with a sufficiently sensitive governor to permit accurate\r\nmusical reproduction. Such a motor was designed, and is now used on\r\nall phonographs except on such special instruments as may be made with\r\nelectric motors, as well as on the successful apparatus that has more\r\nrecently been designed and introduced for stenographic use. Improved\r\nfactory facilities were introduced; new tools were made, and various\r\ntypes of machines were designed so that phonographs can now be bought at\r\nprices ranging from $10 to $200. Even with the changes which were thus\r\nmade in the two machines, the work of developing the business was slow,\r\nas a demand had to be created; and the early prejudice of the public\r\nagainst the phonograph, due to its failure as a stenographic apparatus,\r\nhad to be overcome. The story of the phonograph as an industrial\r\nenterprise, from this point of departure, is itself full of interest,\r\nbut embraces so many details that it is necessarily given in a separate\r\nlater chapter. We must return to the days of 1878, when Edison, with at\r\nleast three first-class inventions to his credit--the quadruplex, the\r\ncarbon telephone, and the phonograph--had become a man of mark and a\r\n\"world character.\"\r\n\r\nThe invention of the phonograph was immediately followed, as usual, by\r\nthe appearance of several other incidental and auxiliary devices, some\r\npatented, and others remaining simply the application of the\r\nprinciples of apparatus that had been worked out. One of these was the\r\ntelephonograph, a combination of a telephone at a distant station with a\r\nphonograph. The diaphragm of the phonograph mouthpiece is actuated by an\r\nelectromagnet in the same way as that of an ordinary telephone receiver,\r\nand in this manner a record of the message spoken from a distance can\r\nbe obtained and turned into sound at will. Evidently such a process\r\nis reversible, and the phonograph can send a message to the distant\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\nThis idea was brilliantly demonstrated in practice in February, 1889, by\r\nMr. W. J. Hammer, one of Edison's earliest and most capable associates,\r\nwho carried on telephonographic communication between New York and an\r\naudience in Philadelphia. The record made in New York on the Edison\r\nphonograph was repeated into an Edison carbon transmitter, sent over one\r\nhundred and three miles of circuit, including six miles of underground\r\ncable; received by an Edison motograph; repeated by that on to a\r\nphonograph; transferred from the phonograph to an Edison carbon\r\ntransmitter, and by that delivered to the Edison motograph receiver in\r\nthe enthusiastic lecture-hall, where every one could hear each sound\r\nand syllable distinctly. In real practice this spectacular playing with\r\nsound vibrations, as if they were lacrosse balls to toss around between\r\nthe goals, could be materially simplified.\r\n\r\nThe modern megaphone, now used universally in making announcements\r\nto large crowds, particularly at sporting events, is also due to this\r\nperiod as a perfection by Edison of many antecedent devices going back,\r\nperhaps, much further than the legendary funnels through which Alexander\r\nthe Great is said to have sent commands to his outlying forces. The\r\nimproved Edison megaphone for long-distance work comprised two horns of\r\nwood or metal about six feet long, tapering from a diameter of two feet\r\nsix inches at the mouth to a small aperture provided with ear-tubes.\r\nThese converging horns or funnels, with a large speaking-trumpet in\r\nbetween them, are mounted on a tripod, and the megaphone is complete.\r\nConversation can be carried on with this megaphone at a distance of\r\nover two miles, as with a ship or the balloon. The modern megaphone\r\nnow employs the receiver form thus introduced as its very effective\r\ntransmitter, with which the old-fashioned speaking-trumpet cannot\r\npossibly compete; and the word \"megaphone\" is universally applied to the\r\nsingle, side-flaring horn.\r\n\r\nA further step in this line brought Edison to the \"aerophone,\" around\r\nwhich the Figaro weaved its fanciful description. In the construction\r\nof the aerophone the same kind of tympanum is used as in the phonograph,\r\nbut the imitation of the human voice, or the transmission of sound,\r\nis effected by the quick opening and closing of valves placed within\r\na steam-whistle or an organ-pipe. The vibrations of the diaphragm\r\ncommunicated to the valves cause them to operate in synchronism, so that\r\nthe vibrations are thrown upon the escaping air or steam; and the result\r\nis an instrument with a capacity of magnifying the sounds two hundred\r\ntimes, and of hurling them to great distances intelligibly, like a huge\r\nfog-siren, but with immense clearness and penetration. All this study\r\nof sound transmission over long distances without wires led up to\r\nthe consideration and invention of pioneer apparatus for wireless\r\ntelegraphy--but that also is another chapter.\r\n\r\nYet one more ingenious device of this period must be noted--Edison's\r\nvocal engine, the patent application for which was executed in August,\r\n1878, the patent being granted the following December. Reference to\r\nthis by Edison himself has already been quoted. The \"voice-engine,\" or\r\n\"phonomotor,\" converts the vibrations of the voice or of music, acting\r\non the diaphragm, into motion which is utilized to drive some secondary\r\nappliance, whether as a toy or for some useful purpose. Thus a man can\r\nactually talk a hole through a board.\r\n\r\nSomewhat weary of all this work and excitement, and not having enjoyed\r\nany cessation from toil, or period of rest, for ten years, Edison jumped\r\neagerly at the opportunity afforded him in the summer of 1878 of making\r\na westward trip. Just thirty years later, on a similar trip over the\r\nsame ground, he jotted down for this volume some of his reminiscences.\r\nThe lure of 1878 was the opportunity to try the ability of his delicate\r\ntasimeter during the total eclipse of the sun, July 29. His admiring\r\nfriend, Prof. George F. Barker, of the University of Pennsylvania, with\r\nwhom he had now been on terms of intimacy for some years, suggested the\r\nholiday, and was himself a member of the excursion party that made\r\nits rendezvous at Rawlins, Wyoming Territory. Edison had tested his\r\ntasimeter, and was satisfied that it would measure down to the millionth\r\npart of a degree Fahrenheit. It was just ten years since he had left the\r\nWest in poverty and obscurity, a penniless operator in search of a job;\r\nbut now he was a great inventor and famous, a welcome addition to the\r\nband of astronomers and physicists assembled to observe the eclipse and\r\nthe corona.\r\n\r\n\"There were astronomers from nearly every nation,\" says Mr. Edison. \"We\r\nhad a special car. The country at that time was rather new; game was\r\nin great abundance, and could be seen all day long from the car window,\r\nespecially antelope. We arrived at Rawlins about 4 P.M. It had a small\r\nmachine shop, and was the point where locomotives were changed for the\r\nnext section. The hotel was a very small one, and by doubling up we were\r\nbarely accommodated. My room-mate was Fox, the correspondent of the New\r\nYork Herald. After we retired and were asleep a thundering knock on\r\nthe door awakened us. Upon opening the door a tall, handsome man with\r\nflowing hair dressed in western style entered the room. His eyes were\r\nbloodshot, and he was somewhat inebriated. He introduced himself as\r\n'Texas Jack'--Joe Chromondo--and said he wanted to see Edison, as he had\r\nread about me in the newspapers. Both Fox and I were rather scared, and\r\ndidn't know what was to be the result of the interview. The landlord\r\nrequested him not to make so much noise, and was thrown out into the\r\nhall. Jack explained that he had just come in with a party which had\r\nbeen hunting, and that he felt fine. He explained, also, that he was the\r\nboss pistol-shot of the West; that it was he who taught the celebrated\r\nDoctor Carver how to shoot. Then suddenly pointing to a weather-vane on\r\nthe freight depot, he pulled out a Colt revolver and fired through the\r\nwindow, hitting the vane. The shot awakened all the people, and they\r\nrushed in to see who was killed. It was only after I told him I was\r\ntired and would see him in the morning that he left. Both Fox and I were\r\nso nervous we didn't sleep any that night.\r\n\r\n\"We were told in the morning that Jack was a pretty good fellow, and was\r\nnot one of the 'bad men,' of whom they had a good supply. They had one\r\nin the jail, and Fox and I went over to see him. A few days before he\r\nhad held up a Union Pacific train and robbed all the passengers. In\r\nthe jail also was a half-breed horse-thief. We interviewed the bad man\r\nthrough bars as big as railroad rails. He looked like a 'bad man.' The\r\nrim of his ear all around came to a sharp edge and was serrated. His\r\neyes were nearly white, and appeared as if made of glass and set\r\nin wrong, like the life-size figures of Indians in the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. His face was also extremely irregular. He wouldn't answer a\r\nsingle question. I learned afterward that he got seven years in prison,\r\nwhile the horse-thief was hanged. As horses ran wild, and there was no\r\nprotection, it meant death to steal one.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one interlude among others. \"The first thing the astronomers\r\ndid was to determine with precision their exact locality upon the earth.\r\nA number of observations were made, and Watson, of Michigan University,\r\nwith two others, worked all night computing, until they agreed. They\r\nsaid they were not in error more than one hundred feet, and that the\r\nstation was twelve miles out of the position given on the maps. It\r\nseemed to take an immense amount of mathematics. I preserved one of\r\nthe sheets, which looked like the time-table of a Chinese railroad. The\r\ninstruments of the various parties were then set up in different parts\r\nof the little town, and got ready for the eclipse which was to occur in\r\nthree or four days. Two days before the event we all got together, and\r\nobtaining an engine and car, went twelve miles farther west to visit the\r\nUnited States Government astronomers at a place called Separation, the\r\napex of the Great Divide, where the waters run east to the Mississippi\r\nand west to the Pacific. Fox and I took our Winchester rifles with an\r\nidea of doing a little shooting. After calling on the Government people\r\nwe started to interview the telegraph operator at this most lonely and\r\ndesolate spot. After talking over old acquaintances I asked him if\r\nthere was any game around. He said, 'Plenty of jack-rabbits.' These\r\njack-rabbits are a very peculiar species. They have ears about six\r\ninches long and very slender legs, about three times as long as those\r\nof an ordinary rabbit, and travel at a great speed by a series of jumps,\r\neach about thirty feet long, as near as I could judge. The local\r\npeople called them 'narrow-gauge mules.' Asking the operator the best\r\ndirection, he pointed west, and noticing a rabbit in a clear space in\r\nthe sage bushes, I said, 'There is one now.' I advanced cautiously to\r\nwithin one hundred feet and shot. The rabbit paid no attention. I\r\nthen advanced to within ten feet and shot again--the rabbit was still\r\nimmovable. On looking around, the whole crowd at the station were\r\nwatching--and then I knew the rabbit was stuffed! However, we did shoot\r\na number of live ones until Fox ran out of cartridges. On returning to\r\nthe station I passed away the time shooting at cans set on a pile of\r\ntins. Finally the operator said to Fox: 'I have a fine Springfield\r\nmusket, suppose you try it!' So Fox took the musket and fired. It\r\nknocked him nearly over. It seems that the musket had been run over by\r\na handcar, which slightly bent the long barrel, but not sufficiently for\r\nan amateur like Fox to notice. After Fox had his shoulder treated with\r\narnica at the Government hospital tent, we returned to Rawlins.\"\r\n\r\nThe eclipse was, however, the prime consideration, and Edison followed\r\nthe example of his colleagues in making ready. The place which he\r\nsecured for setting up his tasimeter was an enclosure hardly suitable\r\nfor the purpose, and he describes the results as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I had my apparatus in a small yard enclosed by a board fence six feet\r\nhigh, at one end there was a house for hens. I noticed that they all\r\nwent to roost just before totality. At the same time a slight wind\r\narose, and at the moment of totality the atmosphere was filled with\r\nthistle-down and other light articles. I noticed one feather,\r\nwhose weight was at least one hundred and fifty milligrams, rise\r\nperpendicularly to the top of the fence, where it floated away on the\r\nwind. My apparatus was entirely too sensitive, and I got no results.\"\r\nIt was found that the heat from the corona of the sun was ten times\r\nthe index capacity of the instrument; but this result did not leave the\r\nvalue of the device in doubt. The Scientific American remarked;\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that the tasimeter is affected by a wider range of etheric\r\nundulations than the eye can take cognizance of, and is withal far more\r\nacutely sensitive, the probabilities are that it will open up hitherto\r\ninaccessible regions of space, and possibly extend the range of aerial\r\nknowledge as far beyond the limit obtained by the telescope as that is\r\nbeyond the narrow reach of unaided vision.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eclipse over, Edison, with Professor Barker, Major Thornberg,\r\nseveral soldiers, and a number of railroad officials, went hunting about\r\none hundred miles south of the railroad in the Ute country. A few months\r\nlater the Major and thirty soldiers were ambushed near the spot at\r\nwhich the hunting-party had camped, and all were killed. Through an\r\nintroduction from Mr. Jay Gould, who then controlled the Union Pacific,\r\nEdison was allowed to ride on the cow-catchers of the locomotives. \"The\r\ndifferent engineers gave me a small cushion, and every day I rode in\r\nthis manner, from Omaha to the Sacramento Valley, except through the\r\nsnow-shed on the summit of the Sierras, without dust or anything else to\r\nobstruct the view. Only once was I in danger when the locomotive struck\r\nan animal about the size of a small cub bear--which I think was a\r\nbadger. This animal struck the front of the locomotive just under the\r\nheadlight with great violence, and was then thrown off by the rebound. I\r\nwas sitting to one side grasping the angle brace, so no harm was done.\"\r\n\r\nThis welcome vacation lasted nearly two months; but Edison was back in\r\nhis laboratory and hard at work before the end of August, gathering\r\nup many loose ends, and trying out many thoughts and ideas that had\r\naccumulated on the trip. One hot afternoon--August 30th, as shown by\r\nthe document in the case--Mr. Edison was found by one of the authors\r\nof this biography employed most busily in making a mysterious series of\r\ntests on paper, using for ink acids that corrugated and blistered the\r\npaper where written upon. When interrogated as to his object, he stated\r\nthat the plan was to afford blind people the means of writing directly\r\nto each other, especially if they were also deaf and could not hear a\r\nmessage on the phonograph. The characters which he was thus forming on\r\nthe paper were high enough in relief to be legible to the delicate touch\r\nof a blind man's fingers, and with simple apparatus letters could be\r\nthus written, sent, and read. There was certainly no question as to the\r\nresult obtained at the moment, which was all that was asked; but the\r\nEdison autograph thus and then written now shows the paper eaten out by\r\nthe acid used, although covered with glass for many years. Mr. Edison\r\ndoes not remember that he ever recurred to this very interesting test.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, ready for anything new or novel, and no record can ever\r\nbe made or presented that would do justice to a tithe of the thoughts\r\nand fancies daily and hourly put upon the rack. The famous note-books,\r\nto which reference will be made later, were not begun as a regular\r\nseries, as it was only the profusion of these ideas that suggested\r\nthe vital value of such systematic registration. Then as now, the\r\npropositions brought to Edison ranged over every conceivable subject,\r\nbut the years have taught him caution in grappling with them. He tells\r\nan amusing story of one dilemma into which his good-nature led him at\r\nthis period: \"At Menlo Park one day, a farmer came in and asked if I\r\nknew any way to kill potato-bugs. He had twenty acres of potatoes, and\r\nthe vines were being destroyed. I sent men out and culled two quarts\r\nof bugs, and tried every chemical I had to destroy them. Bisulphide of\r\ncarbon was found to do it instantly. I got a drum and went over to the\r\npotato farm and sprinkled it on the vines with a pot. Every bug dropped\r\ndead. The next morning the farmer came in very excited and reported\r\nthat the stuff had killed the vines as well. I had to pay $300 for not\r\nexperimenting properly.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this year, 1878, the phonograph made its way also to Europe,\r\nand various sums of money were paid there to secure the rights to its\r\nmanufacture and exploitation. In England, for example, the Microscopic\r\nCompany paid $7500 down and agreed to a royalty, while arrangements were\r\neffected also in France, Russia, and other countries. In every instance,\r\nas in this country, the commercial development had to wait several\r\nyears, for in the mean time another great art had been brought into\r\nexistence, demanding exclusive attention and exhaustive toil. And when\r\nthe work was done the reward was a new heaven and a new earth--in the\r\nart of illumination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTION OF THE INCANDESCENT LAMP\r\n\r\nIT is possible to imagine a time to come when the hours of work and rest\r\nwill once more be regulated by the sun. But the course of civilization\r\nhas been marked by an artificial lengthening of the day, and by a\r\nconstant striving after more perfect means of illumination. Why mankind\r\nshould sleep through several hours of sunlight in the morning, and\r\nstay awake through a needless time in the evening, can probably only be\r\nattributed to total depravity. It is certainly a most stupid, expensive,\r\nand harmful habit. In no one thing has man shown greater fertility of\r\ninvention than in lighting; to nothing does he cling more tenaciously\r\nthan to his devices for furnishing light. Electricity to-day reigns\r\nsupreme in the field of illumination, but every other kind of artificial\r\nlight that has ever been known is still in use somewhere. Toward its\r\nlight-bringers the race has assumed an attitude of veneration, though it\r\nhas forgotten, if it ever heard, the names of those who first brightened\r\nits gloom and dissipated its darkness. If the tallow candle, hitherto\r\nunknown, were now invented, its creator would be hailed as one of the\r\ngreatest benefactors of the present age.\r\n\r\nUp to the close of the eighteenth century, the means of house and street\r\nillumination were of two generic kinds--grease and oil; but then came\r\na swift and revolutionary change in the adoption of gas. The ideas and\r\nmethods of Murdoch and Lebon soon took definite shape, and \"coal smoke\"\r\nwas piped from its place of origin to distant points of consumption.\r\nAs early as 1804, the first company ever organized for gas lighting was\r\nformed in London, one side of Pall Mall being lit up by the enthusiastic\r\npioneer, Winsor, in 1807. Equal activity was shown in America, and\r\nBaltimore began the practice of gas lighting in 1816. It is true that\r\nthere were explosions, and distinguished men like Davy and Watt opined\r\nthat the illuminant was too dangerous; but the \"spirit of coal\" had\r\ndemonstrated its usefulness convincingly, and a commercial development\r\nbegan, which, for extent and rapidity, was not inferior to that marking\r\nthe concurrent adoption of steam in industry and transportation.\r\n\r\nMeantime the wax candle and the Argand oil lamp held their own bravely.\r\nThe whaling fleets, long after gas came into use, were one of the\r\ngreatest sources of our national wealth. To New Bedford, Massachusetts,\r\nalone, some three or four hundred ships brought their whale and sperm\r\noil, spermaceti, and whalebone; and at one time that port was accounted\r\nthe richest city in the United States in proportion to its population.\r\nThe ship-owners and refiners of that whaling metropolis were slow to\r\nbelieve that their monopoly could ever be threatened by newer sources of\r\nillumination; but gas had become available in the cities, and coal-oil\r\nand petroleum were now added to the list of illuminating materials. The\r\nAmerican whaling fleet, which at the time of Edison's birth mustered\r\nover seven hundred sail, had dwindled probably to a bare tenth when he\r\ntook up the problem of illumination; and the competition of oil from the\r\nground with oil from the sea, and with coal-gas, had made the artificial\r\nproduction of light cheaper than ever before, when up to the middle\r\nof the century it had remained one of the heaviest items of domestic\r\nexpense. Moreover, just about the time that Edison took up incandescent\r\nlighting, water-gas was being introduced on a large scale as a\r\ncommercial illuminant that could be produced at a much lower cost than\r\ncoal-gas.\r\n\r\nThroughout the first half of the nineteenth century the search for a\r\npractical electric light was almost wholly in the direction of employing\r\nmethods analogous to those already familiar; in other words, obtaining\r\nthe illumination from the actual consumption of the light-giving\r\nmaterial. In the third quarter of the century these methods were\r\nbrought to practicality, but all may be referred back to the brilliant\r\ndemonstrations of Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution, circa\r\n1809-10, when, with the current from a battery of two thousand cells, he\r\nproduced an intense voltaic arc between the points of consuming sticks\r\nof charcoal. For more than thirty years the arc light remained an\r\nexpensive laboratory experiment; but the coming of the dynamo placed\r\nthat illuminant on a commercial basis. The mere fact that electrical\r\nenergy from the least expensive chemical battery using up zinc and\r\nacids costs twenty times as much as that from a dynamo--driven by\r\nsteam-engine--is in itself enough to explain why so many of the electric\r\narts lingered in embryo after their fundamental principles had been\r\ndiscovered. Here is seen also further proof of the great truth that one\r\ninvention often waits for another.\r\n\r\nFrom 1850 onward the improvements in both the arc lamp and the dynamo\r\nwere rapid; and under the superintendence of the great Faraday, in 1858,\r\nprotecting beams of intense electric light from the voltaic arc were\r\nshed over the waters of the Straits of Dover from the beacons of South\r\nForeland and Dungeness. By 1878 the arc-lighting industry had sprung\r\ninto existence in so promising a manner as to engender an extraordinary\r\nfever and furor of speculation. At the Philadelphia Centennial\r\nExposition of 1876, Wallace-Farmer dynamos built at Ansonia,\r\nConnecticut, were shown, with the current from which arc lamps were\r\nthere put in actual service. A year or two later the work of Charles F.\r\nBrush and Edward Weston laid the deep foundation of modern arc lighting\r\nin America, securing as well substantial recognition abroad.\r\n\r\nThus the new era had been ushered in, but it was based altogether on the\r\nconsumption of some material--carbon--in a lamp open to the air. Every\r\nlamp the world had ever known did this, in one way or another. Edison\r\nhimself began at that point, and his note-books show that he made\r\nvarious experiments with this type of lamp at a very early stage.\r\nIndeed, his experiments had led him so far as to anticipate in 1875 what\r\nare now known as \"flaming arcs,\" the exceedingly bright and generally\r\norange or rose-colored lights which have been introduced within the last\r\nfew years, and are now so frequently seen in streets and public places.\r\nWhile the arcs with plain carbons are bluish-white, those with carbons\r\ncontaining calcium fluoride have a notable golden glow.\r\n\r\nHe was convinced, however, that the greatest field of lighting lay in\r\nthe illumination of houses and other comparatively enclosed areas,\r\nto replace the ordinary gas light, rather than in the illumination\r\nof streets and other outdoor places by lights of great volume\r\nand brilliancy. Dismissing from his mind quickly the commercial\r\nimpossibility of using arc lights for general indoor illumination,\r\nhe arrived at the conclusion that an electric lamp giving light by\r\nincandescence was the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nEdison was familiar with the numerous but impracticable and commercially\r\nunsuccessful efforts that had been previously made by other inventors\r\nand investigators to produce electric light by incandescence, and at the\r\ntime that he began his experiments, in 1877, almost the whole scientific\r\nworld had pronounced such an idea as impossible of fulfilment. The\r\nleading electricians, physicists, and experts of the period had been\r\nstudying the subject for more than a quarter of a century, and with but\r\none known exception had proven mathematically and by close reasoning\r\nthat the \"Subdivision of the Electric Light,\" as it was then termed, was\r\npractically beyond attainment. Opinions of this nature have ever been\r\nbut a stimulus to Edison when he has given deep thought to a subject,\r\nand has become impressed with strong convictions of possibility, and\r\nin this particular case he was satisfied that the subdivision of the\r\nelectric light--or, more correctly, the subdivision of the electric\r\ncurrent--was not only possible but entirely practicable.\r\n\r\nIt will have been perceived from the foregoing chapters that from the\r\ntime of boyhood, when he first began to rub against the world, his\r\ncommercial instincts were alert and predominated in almost all of the\r\nenterprises that he set in motion. This characteristic trait had grown\r\nstronger as he matured, having received, as it did, fresh impetus and\r\nstrength from his one lapse in the case of his first patented invention,\r\nthe vote-recorder. The lesson he then learned was to devote his\r\ninventive faculties only to things for which there was a real, genuine\r\ndemand, and that would subserve the actual necessities of humanity; and\r\nit was probably a fortunate circumstance that this lesson was learned\r\nat the outset of his career as an inventor. He has never assumed to be a\r\nphilosopher or \"pure scientist.\"\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may grasp an adequate idea of the magnitude and\r\nimportance of Edison's invention of the incandescent lamp, it will be\r\nnecessary to review briefly the \"state of the art\" at the time he\r\nbegan his experiments on that line. After the invention of the voltaic\r\nbattery, early in the last century, experiments were made which\r\ndetermined that heat could be produced by the passage of the electric\r\ncurrent through wires of platinum and other metals, and through pieces\r\nof carbon, as noted already, and it was, of course, also observed that\r\nif sufficient current were passed through these conductors they could be\r\nbrought from the lower stage of redness up to the brilliant white heat\r\nof incandescence. As early as 1845 the results of these experiments were\r\ntaken advantage of when Starr, a talented American who died at the early\r\nage of twenty-five, suggested, in his English patent of that year, two\r\nforms of small incandescent electric lamps, one having a burner made\r\nfrom platinum foil placed under a glass cover without excluding the air;\r\nand the other composed of a thin plate or pencil of carbon enclosed in\r\na Torricellian vacuum. These suggestions of young Starr were followed\r\nby many other experimenters, whose improvements consisted principally in\r\ndevices to increase the compactness and portability of the lamp, in\r\nthe sealing of the lamp chamber to prevent the admission of air, and\r\nin means for renewing the carbon burner when it had been consumed. Thus\r\nRoberts, in 1852, proposed to cement the neck of the glass globe into a\r\nmetallic cup, and to provide it with a tube or stop-cock for exhaustion\r\nby means of a hand-pump. Lodyguine, Konn, Kosloff, and Khotinsky,\r\nbetween 1872 and 1877, proposed various ingenious devices for perfecting\r\nthe joint between the metal base and the glass globe, and also provided\r\ntheir lamps with several short carbon pencils, which were automatically\r\nbrought into circuit successively as the pencils were consumed. In 1876\r\nor 1877, Bouliguine proposed the employment of a long carbon pencil, a\r\nshort section only of which was in circuit at any one time and formed\r\nthe burner, the lamp being provided with a mechanism for automatically\r\npushing other sections of the pencil into position between the contacts\r\nto renew the burner. Sawyer and Man proposed, in 1878, to make\r\nthe bottom plate of glass instead of metal, and provided ingenious\r\narrangements for charging the lamp chamber with an atmosphere of pure\r\nnitrogen gas which does not support combustion.\r\n\r\nThese lamps and many others of similar character, ingenious as they\r\nwere, failed to become of any commercial value, due, among other things,\r\nto the brief life of the carbon burner. Even under the best conditions\r\nit was found that the carbon members were subject to a rapid\r\ndisintegration or evaporation, which experimenters assumed was due to\r\nthe disrupting action of the electric current; and hence the conclusion\r\nthat carbon contained in itself the elements of its own destruction, and\r\nwas not a suitable material for the burner of an incandescent lamp. On\r\nthe other hand, platinum, although found to be the best of all materials\r\nfor the purpose, aside from its great expense, and not combining with\r\noxygen at high temperatures as does carbon, required to be brought\r\nso near the melting-point in order to give light, that a very slight\r\nincrease in the temperature resulted in its destruction. It was assumed\r\nthat the difficulty lay in the material of the burner itself, and not in\r\nits environment.\r\n\r\nIt was not realized up to such a comparatively recent date as 1879 that\r\nthe solution of the great problem of subdivision of the electric current\r\nwould not, however, be found merely in the production of a durable\r\nincandescent electric lamp--even if any of the lamps above referred to\r\nhad fulfilled that requirement. The other principal features necessary\r\nto subdivide the electric current successfully were: the burning of an\r\nindefinite number of lights on the same circuit; each light to give\r\na useful and economical degree of illumination; and each light to\r\nbe independent of all the others in regard to its operation and\r\nextinguishment.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of scientific men of the period on the subject are well\r\nrepresented by the two following extracts--the first, from a lecture at\r\nthe Royal United Service Institution, about February, 1879, by Mr. (Sir)\r\nW. H. Preece, one of the most eminent electricians in England,\r\nwho, after discussing the question mathematically, said: \"Hence the\r\nsub-division of the light is an absolute ignis fatuus.\" The other\r\nextract is from a book written by Paget Higgs, LL.D., D.Sc., published\r\nin London in 1879, in which he says: \"Much nonsense has been talked\r\nin relation to this subject. Some inventors have claimed the power to\r\n'indefinitely divide' the electric current, not knowing or forgetting\r\nthat such a statement is incompatible with the well-proven law of\r\nconservation of energy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some inventors,\" in the last sentence just quoted, probably--indeed,\r\nwe think undoubtedly--refers to Edison, whose earlier work in electric\r\nlighting (1878) had been announced in this country and abroad, and\r\nwho had then stated boldly his conviction of the practicability of\r\nthe subdivision of the electrical current. The above extracts are good\r\nillustrations, however, of scientific opinions up to the end of\r\n1879, when Mr. Edison's epoch-making invention rendered them entirely\r\nuntenable. The eminent scientist, John Tyndall, while not sharing these\r\nprecise views, at least as late as January 17, 1879, delivered a lecture\r\nbefore the Royal Institution on \"The Electric Light,\" when, after\r\npointing out the development of the art up to Edison's work, and showing\r\nthe apparent hopelessness of the problem, he said: \"Knowing something of\r\nthe intricacy of the practical problem, I should certainly prefer seeing\r\nit in Edison's hands to having it in mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader may have deemed this sketch of the state of the art to be\r\na considerable digression; but it is certainly due to the subject to\r\npresent the facts in such a manner as to show that this great invention\r\nwas neither the result of improving some process or device that was\r\nknown or existing at the time, nor due to any unforeseen lucky chance,\r\nnor the accidental result of other experiments. On the contrary, it was\r\nthe legitimate outcome of a series of exhaustive experiments founded\r\nupon logical and original reasoning in a mind that had the courage and\r\nhardihood to set at naught the confirmed opinions of the world,\r\nvoiced by those generally acknowledged to be the best exponents of the\r\nart--experiments carried on amid a storm of jeers and derision, almost\r\nas contemptuous as if the search were for the discovery of perpetual\r\nmotion. In this we see the man foreshadowed by the boy who, when he\r\nobtained his books on chemistry or physics, did not accept any statement\r\nof fact or experiment therein, but worked out every one of them himself\r\nto ascertain whether or not they were true.\r\n\r\nAlthough this brings the reader up to the year 1879, one must turn back\r\ntwo years and accompany Edison in his first attack on the electric-light\r\nproblem. In 1877 he sold his telephone invention (the carbon\r\ntransmitter) to the Western Union Telegraph Company, which had\r\npreviously come into possession also of his quadruplex inventions,\r\nas already related. He was still busily engaged on the telephone,\r\non acoustic electrical transmission, sextuplex telegraphs, duplex\r\ntelegraphs, miscellaneous carbon articles, and other inventions of a\r\nminor nature. During the whole of the previous year and until late in\r\nthe summer of 1877, he had been working with characteristic energy and\r\nenthusiasm on the telephone; and, in developing this invention to a\r\nsuccessful issue, had preferred the use of carbon and had employed it in\r\nnumerous forms, especially in the form of carbonized paper.\r\n\r\nEighteen hundred and seventy-seven in Edison's laboratory was a\r\nveritable carbon year, for it was carbon in some shape or form for\r\ninterpolation in electric circuits of various kinds that occupied the\r\nthoughts of the whole force from morning to night. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that in September of that year, when Edison turned his\r\nthoughts actively toward electric lighting by incandescence, his early\r\nexperiments should be in the line of carbon as an illuminant. His\r\noriginality of method was displayed at the very outset, for one of the\r\nfirst experiments was the bringing to incandescence of a strip of carbon\r\nin the open air to ascertain merely how much current was required.\r\nThis conductor was a strip of carbonized paper about an inch long,\r\none-sixteenth of an inch broad, and six or seven one-thousandths of an\r\ninch thick, the ends of which were secured to clamps that formed the\r\npoles of a battery. The carbon was lighted up to incandescence, and, of\r\ncourse, oxidized and disintegrated immediately. Within a few days this\r\nwas followed by experiments with the same kind of carbon, but in vacuo\r\nby means of a hand-worked air-pump. This time the carbon strip burned\r\nat incandescence for about eight minutes. Various expedients to prevent\r\noxidization were tried, such, for instance, as coating the carbon with\r\npowdered glass, which in melting would protect the carbon from the\r\natmosphere, but without successful results.\r\n\r\nEdison was inclined to concur in the prevailing opinion as to the easy\r\ndestructibility of carbon, but, without actually settling the point in\r\nhis mind, he laid aside temporarily this line of experiment and entered\r\na new field. He had made previously some trials of platinum wire as\r\nan incandescent burner for a lamp, but left it for a time in favor of\r\ncarbon. He now turned to the use of almost infusible metals--such as\r\nboron, ruthenium, chromium, etc.--as separators or tiny bridges between\r\ntwo carbon points, the current acting so as to bring these separators\r\nto a high degree of incandescence, at which point they would emit a\r\nbrilliant light. He also placed some of these refractory metals directly\r\nin the circuit, bringing them to incandescence, and used silicon in\r\npowdered form in glass tubes placed in the electric circuit. His notes\r\ninclude the use of powdered silicon mixed with lime or other very\r\ninfusible non-conductors or semi-conductors. Edison's conclusions on\r\nthese substances were that, while in some respects they were within the\r\nbounds of possibility for the subdivision of the electric current, they\r\ndid not reach the ideal that he had in mind for commercial results.\r\n\r\nEdison's systematized attacks on the problem were two in number, the\r\nfirst of which we have just related, which began in September, 1877, and\r\ncontinued until about January, 1878. Contemporaneously, he and his\r\nforce of men were very busily engaged day and night on other important\r\nenterprises and inventions. Among the latter, the phonograph may be\r\nspecially mentioned, as it was invented in the late fall of 1877. From\r\nthat time until July, 1878, his time and attention day and night were\r\nalmost completely absorbed by the excitement caused by the invention and\r\nexhibition of the machine. In July, feeling entitled to a brief vacation\r\nafter several years of continuous labor, Edison went with the expedition\r\nto Wyoming to observe an eclipse of the sun, and incidentally to test\r\nhis tasimeter, a delicate instrument devised by him for measuring\r\nheat transmitted through immense distances of space. His trip has been\r\nalready described. He was absent about two months. Coming home rested\r\nand refreshed, Mr. Edison says: \"After my return from the trip to\r\nobserve the eclipse of the sun, I went with Professor Barker, Professor\r\nof Physics in the University of Pennsylvania, and Doctor Chandler,\r\nProfessor of Chemistry in Columbia College, to see Mr. Wallace, a large\r\nmanufacturer of brass in Ansonia, Connecticut. Wallace at this time was\r\nexperimenting on series arc lighting. Just at that time I wanted to take\r\nup something new, and Professor Barker suggested that I go to work and\r\nsee if I could subdivide the electric light so it could be got in small\r\nunits like gas. This was not a new suggestion, because I had made a\r\nnumber of experiments on electric lighting a year before this. They had\r\nbeen laid aside for the phonograph. I determined to take up the search\r\nagain and continue it. On my return home I started my usual course of\r\ncollecting every kind of data about gas; bought all the transactions\r\nof the gas-engineering societies, etc., all the back volumes of gas\r\njournals, etc. Having obtained all the data, and investigated gas-jet\r\ndistribution in New York by actual observations, I made up my mind that\r\nthe problem of the subdivision of the electric current could be solved\r\nand made commercial.\" About the end of August, 1878, he began his second\r\norganized attack on the subdivision of the current, which was steadily\r\nmaintained until he achieved signal victory a year and two months later.\r\n\r\nThe date of this interesting visit to Ansonia is fixed by an inscription\r\nmade by Edison on a glass goblet which he used. The legend in diamond\r\nscratches runs: \"Thomas A. Edison, September 8, 1878, made under the\r\nelectric light.\" Other members of the party left similar memorials,\r\nwhich under the circumstances have come to be greatly prized. A number\r\nof experiments were witnessed in arc lighting, and Edison secured\r\na small Wallace-Farmer dynamo for his own work, as well as a set of\r\nWallace arc lamps for lighting the Menlo Park laboratory. Before leaving\r\nAnsonia, Edison remarked, significantly: \"Wallace, I believe I can beat\r\nyou making electric lights. I don't think you are working in the right\r\ndirection.\" Another date which shows how promptly the work was resumed\r\nis October 14, 1878, when Edison filed an application for his first\r\nlighting patent: \"Improvement in Electric Lights.\" In after years,\r\ndiscussing the work of Wallace, who was not only a great pioneer\r\nelectrical manufacturer, but one of the founders of the wire-drawing and\r\nbrass-working industry, Edison said: \"Wallace was one of the earliest\r\npioneers in electrical matters in this country. He has done a great deal\r\nof good work, for which others have received the credit; and the\r\nwork which he did in the early days of electric lighting others\r\nhave benefited by largely, and he has been crowded to one side and\r\nforgotten.\" Associated in all this work with Wallace at Ansonia was\r\nProf. Moses G. Farmer, famous for the introduction of the fire-alarm\r\nsystem; as the discoverer of the self-exciting principle of the modern\r\ndynamo; as a pioneer experimenter in the electric-railway field; as a\r\ntelegraph engineer, and as a lecturer on mines and explosives to\r\nnaval classes at Newport. During 1858, Farmer, who, like Edison, was a\r\nceaseless investigator, had made a series of studies upon the production\r\nof light by electricity, and had even invented an automatic regulator\r\nby which a number of platinum lamps in multiple arc could be kept at\r\nuniform voltage for any length of time. In July, 1859, he lit up one of\r\nthe rooms of his house at Salem, Massachusetts, every evening with such\r\nlamps, using in them small pieces of platinum and iridium wire, which\r\nwere made to incandesce by means of current from primary batteries.\r\nFarmer was not one of the party that memorable day in September, but his\r\nwork was known through his intimate connection with Wallace, and there\r\nis no doubt that reference was made to it. Such work had not led\r\nvery far, the \"lamps\" were hopelessly short-lived, and everything was\r\nobviously experimental; but it was all helpful and suggestive to one\r\nwhose open mind refused no hint from any quarter.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of his new attempts, Edison returned to his\r\nexperiments with carbon as an incandescent burner for a lamp, and made\r\na very large number of trials, all in vacuo. Not only were the ordinary\r\nstrip paper carbons tried again, but tissue-paper coated with tar and\r\nlampblack was rolled into thin sticks, like knitting-needles, carbonized\r\nand raised to incandescence in vacuo. Edison also tried hard carbon,\r\nwood carbons, and almost every conceivable variety of paper carbon in\r\nlike manner. With the best vacuum that he could then get by means of the\r\nordinary air-pump, the carbons would last, at the most, only from ten to\r\nfifteen minutes in a state of incandescence. Such results were evidently\r\nnot of commercial value.\r\n\r\nEdison then turned his attention in other directions. In his earliest\r\nconsideration of the problem of subdividing the electric current, he had\r\ndecided that the only possible solution lay in the employment of a lamp\r\nwhose incandescing body should have a high resistance combined with a\r\nsmall radiating surface, and be capable of being used in what is called\r\n\"multiple arc,\" so that each unit, or lamp, could be turned on or off\r\nwithout interfering with any other unit or lamp. No other arrangement\r\ncould possibly be considered as commercially practicable.\r\n\r\nThe full significance of the three last preceding sentences will not be\r\nobvious to laymen, as undoubtedly many of the readers of this book may\r\nbe; and now being on the threshold of the series of Edison's experiments\r\nthat led up to the basic invention, we interpolate a brief explanation,\r\nin order that the reader may comprehend the logical reasoning and work\r\nthat in this case produced such far-reaching results.\r\n\r\nIf we consider a simple circuit in which a current is flowing, and\r\ninclude in the circuit a carbon horseshoe-like conductor which it is\r\ndesired to bring to incandescence by the heat generated by the current\r\npassing through it, it is first evident that the resistance offered to\r\nthe current by the wires themselves must be less than that offered by\r\nthe burner, because, otherwise current would be wasted as heat in the\r\nconducting wires. At the very foundation of the electric-lighting art is\r\nthe essentially commercial consideration that one cannot spend very much\r\nfor conductors, and Edison determined that, in order to use wires of a\r\npracticable size, the voltage of the current (i.e., its pressure or\r\nthe characteristic that overcomes resistance to its flow) should be one\r\nhundred and ten volts, which since its adoption has been the standard.\r\nTo use a lower voltage or pressure, while making the solution of the\r\nlighting problem a simple one as we shall see, would make it necessary\r\nto increase the size of the conducting wires to a prohibitive extent.\r\nTo increase the voltage or pressure materially, while permitting\r\nsome saving in the cost of conductors, would enormously increase the\r\ndifficulties of making a sufficiently high resistance conductor to\r\nsecure light by incandescence. This apparently remote consideration\r\n--weight of copper used--was really the commercial key to the problem,\r\njust as the incandescent burner was the scientific key to that problem.\r\nBefore Edison's invention incandescent lamps had been suggested as\r\na possibility, but they were provided with carbon rods or strips of\r\nrelatively low resistance, and to bring these to incandescence required\r\na current of low pressure, because a current of high voltage would pass\r\nthrough them so readily as not to generate heat; and to carry a current\r\nof low pressure through wires without loss would require wires of\r\nenormous size. [8] Having a current of relatively high pressure to\r\ncontend with, it was necessary to provide a carbon burner which, as\r\ncompared with what had previously been suggested, should have a very\r\ngreat resistance. Carbon as a material, determined after patient search,\r\napparently offered the greatest hope, but even with this substance the\r\nnecessary high resistance could be obtained only by making the burner\r\nof extremely small cross-section, thereby also reducing its radiating\r\nsurface. Therefore, the crucial point was the production of a hair-like\r\ncarbon filament, with a relatively great resistance and small radiating\r\nsurface, capable of withstanding mechanical shock, and susceptible of\r\nbeing maintained at a temperature of over two thousand degrees for a\r\nthousand hours or more before breaking. And this filamentary conductor\r\nrequired to be supported in a vacuum chamber so perfectly formed and\r\nconstructed that during all those hours, and subjected as it is to\r\nvarying temperatures, not a particle of air should enter to disintegrate\r\nthe filament. And not only so, but the lamp after its design must not\r\nbe a mere laboratory possibility, but a practical commercial article\r\ncapable of being manufactured at low cost and in large quantities. A\r\nstatement of what had to be done in those days of actual as well as\r\nscientific electrical darkness is quite sufficient to explain Tyndall's\r\nattitude of mind in preferring that the problem should be in Edison's\r\nhands rather than in his own. To say that the solution of the problem\r\nlay merely in reducing the size of the carbon burner to a mere hair, is\r\nto state a half-truth only; but who, we ask, would have had the temerity\r\neven to suggest that such an attenuated body could be maintained at a\r\nwhite heat, without disintegration, for a thousand hours? The solution\r\nconsisted not only in that, but in the enormous mass of patiently\r\nworked-out details--the manufacture of the filaments, their uniform\r\ncarbonization, making the globes, producing a perfect vacuum, and\r\ncountless other factors, the omission of any one of which would probably\r\nhave resulted eventually in failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 8: As a practical illustration of these facts it\r\n     was calculated by Professor Barker, of the University of\r\n     Pennsylvania (after Edison had invented the incandescent\r\n     lamp), that if it should cost $100,000 for copper conductors\r\n     to supply current to Edison lamps in a given area, it would\r\n     cost about $200,000,000 for copper conductors for lighting\r\n     the same area by lamps of the earlier experimenters--such,\r\n     for instance, as the lamp invented by Konn in 1875. This\r\n     enormous difference would be accounted for by the fact that\r\n     Edison's lamp was one having a high resistance and\r\n     relatively small radiating surface, while Konn's lamp was\r\n     one having a very low resistance and large radiating\r\n     surface.]\r\n\r\nContinuing the digression one step farther in order to explain the term\r\n\"multiple arc,\" it may be stated that there are two principal systems\r\nof distributing electric current, one termed \"series,\" and the other\r\n\"multiple arc.\" The two are illustrated, diagrammatically, side by side,\r\nthe arrows indicating flow of current. The series system, it will be\r\nseen, presents one continuous path for the current. The current for the\r\nlast lamp must pass through the first and all the intermediate lamps.\r\nHence, if any one light goes out, the continuity of the path is broken,\r\ncurrent cannot flow, and all the lamps are extinguished unless a loop\r\nor by-path is provided. It is quite obvious that such a system would be\r\ncommercially impracticable where small units, similar to gas jets, were\r\nemployed. On the other hand, in the multiple-arc system, current may be\r\nconsidered as flowing in two parallel conductors like the vertical sides\r\nof a ladder, the ends of which never come together. Each lamp is placed\r\nin a separate circuit across these two conductors, like a rung in the\r\nladder, thus making a separate and independent path for the current in\r\neach case. Hence, if a lamp goes out, only that individual subdivision,\r\nor ladder step, is affected; just that one particular path for the\r\ncurrent is interrupted, but none of the other lamps is interfered with.\r\nThey remain lighted, each one independent of the other. The reader will\r\nquite readily understand, therefore, that a multiple-arc system is the\r\nonly one practically commercial where electric light is to be used in\r\nsmall units like those of gas or oil.\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature of the problem that confronted Edison at the outset.\r\nThere was nothing in the whole world that in any way approximated a\r\nsolution, although the most brilliant minds in the electrical art had\r\nbeen assiduously working on the subject for a quarter of a century\r\npreceding. As already seen, he came early to the conclusion that the\r\nonly solution lay in the use of a lamp of high resistance and small\r\nradiating surface, and, with characteristic fervor and energy, he\r\nattacked the problem from this standpoint, having absolute faith in\r\na successful outcome. The mere fact that even with the successful\r\nproduction of the electric lamp the assault on the complete problem\r\nof commercial lighting would hardly be begun did not deter him in the\r\nslightest. To one of Edison's enthusiastic self-confidence the long\r\nvista of difficulties ahead--we say it in all sincerity--must have been\r\nalluring.\r\n\r\nAfter having devoted several months to experimental trials of carbon,\r\nat the end of 1878, as already detailed, he turned his attention to the\r\nplatinum group of metals and began a series of experiments in which he\r\nused chiefly platinum wire and iridium wire, and alloys of refractory\r\nmetals in the form of wire burners for incandescent lamps. These metals\r\nhave very high fusing-points, and were found to last longer than the\r\ncarbon strips previously used when heated up to incandescence by the\r\nelectric current, although under such conditions as were then possible\r\nthey were melted by excess of current after they had been lighted a\r\ncomparatively short time, either in the open air or in such a vacuum as\r\ncould be obtained by means of the ordinary air-pump.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Edison continued along this line of experiment with\r\nunremitting vigor, making improvement after improvement, until about\r\nApril, 1879, he devised a means whereby platinum wire of a given length,\r\nwhich would melt in the open air when giving a light equal to four\r\ncandles, would emit a light of twenty-five candle-power without fusion.\r\nThis was accomplished by introducing the platinum wire into an all-glass\r\nglobe, completely sealed and highly exhausted of air, and passing a\r\ncurrent through the platinum wire while the vacuum was being made.\r\nIn this, which was a new and radical invention, we see the first step\r\ntoward the modern incandescent lamp. The knowledge thus obtained that\r\ncurrent passing through the platinum during exhaustion would drive out\r\noccluded gases (i.e., gases mechanically held in or upon the metal), and\r\nincrease the infusibility of the platinum, led him to aim at securing\r\ngreater perfection in the vacuum, on the theory that the higher the\r\nvacuum obtained, the higher would be the infusibility of the platinum\r\nburner. And this fact also was of the greatest importance in making\r\nsuccessful the final use of carbon, because without the subjection of\r\nthe carbon to the heating effect of current during the formation of the\r\nvacuum, the presence of occluded gases would have been a fatal obstacle.\r\n\r\nContinuing these experiments with most fervent zeal, taking no account\r\nof the passage of time, with an utter disregard for meals, and but\r\nscanty hours of sleep snatched reluctantly at odd periods of the day\r\nor night, Edison kept his laboratory going without cessation. A great\r\nvariety of lamps was made of the platinum-iridium type, mostly with\r\nthermal devices to regulate the temperature of the burner and prevent\r\nits being melted by an excess of current. The study of apparatus for\r\nobtaining more perfect vacua was unceasingly carried on, for Edison\r\nrealized that in this there lay a potent factor of ultimate success.\r\nAbout August he had obtained a pump that would produce a vacuum up to\r\nabout the one-hundred-thousandth part of an atmosphere, and some time\r\nduring the next month, or beginning of October, had obtained one that\r\nwould produce a vacuum up to the one-millionth part of an atmosphere.\r\nIt must be remembered that the conditions necessary for MAINTAINING this\r\nhigh vacuum were only made possible by his invention of the one-piece\r\nall-glass globe, in which all the joints were hermetically sealed during\r\nits manufacture into a lamp, whereby a high vacuum could be retained\r\ncontinuously for any length of time.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining this perfection of vacuum apparatus, Edison realized that\r\nhe was approaching much nearer to a solution of the problem. In his\r\nexperiments with the platinum-iridium lamps, he had been working all\r\nthe time toward the proposition of high resistance and small radiating\r\nsurface, until he had made a lamp having thirty feet of fine platinum\r\nwire wound upon a small bobbin of infusible material; but the desired\r\neconomy, simplicity, and durability were not obtained in this manner,\r\nalthough at all times the burner was maintained at a critically high\r\ntemperature. After attaining a high degree of perfection with these\r\nlamps, he recognized their impracticable character, and his mind\r\nreverted to the opinion he had formed in his early experiments two years\r\nbefore--viz., that carbon had the requisite resistance to permit a very\r\nsimple conductor to accomplish the object if it could be used in the\r\nform of a hair-like \"filament,\" provided the filament itself could be\r\nmade sufficiently homogeneous. As we have already seen, he could not use\r\ncarbon successfully in his earlier experiments, for the strips of carbon\r\nhe then employed, although they were much larger than \"filaments,\"\r\nwould not stand, but were consumed in a few minutes under the imperfect\r\nconditions then at his command.\r\n\r\nNow, however, that he had found means for obtaining and maintaining high\r\nvacua, Edison immediately went back to carbon, which from the first\r\nhe had conceived of as the ideal substance for a burner. His next step\r\nproved conclusively the correctness of his old deductions. On October\r\n21, 1879, after many patient trials, he carbonized a piece of cotton\r\nsewing-thread bent into a loop or horseshoe form, and had it sealed\r\ninto a glass globe from which he exhausted the air until a vacuum up to\r\none-millionth of an atmosphere was produced. This lamp, when put on\r\nthe circuit, lighted up brightly to incandescence and maintained its\r\nintegrity for over forty hours, and lo! the practical incandescent lamp\r\nwas born. The impossible, so called, had been attained; subdivision\r\nof the electric-light current was made practicable; the goal had\r\nbeen reached; and one of the greatest inventions of the century\r\nwas completed. Up to this time Edison had spent over $40,000 in his\r\nelectric-light experiments, but the results far more than justified the\r\nexpenditure, for with this lamp he made the discovery that the FILAMENT\r\nof carbon, under the conditions of high vacuum, was commercially\r\nstable and would stand high temperatures without the disintegration and\r\noxidation that took place in all previous attempts that he knew of\r\nfor making an incandescent burner out of carbon. Besides, this lamp\r\npossessed the characteristics of high resistance and small radiating\r\nsurface, permitting economy in the outlay for conductors, and requiring\r\nonly a small current for each unit of light--conditions that were\r\nabsolutely necessary of fulfilment in order to accomplish commercially\r\nthe subdivision of the electric-light current.\r\n\r\nThis slender, fragile, tenuous thread of brittle carbon, glowing\r\nsteadily and continuously with a soft light agreeable to the eyes,\r\nwas the tiny key that opened the door to a world revolutionized in\r\nits interior illumination. It was a triumphant vindication of Edison's\r\nreasoning powers, his clear perceptions, his insight into possibilities,\r\nand his inventive faculty, all of which had already been productive of\r\nso many startling, practical, and epoch-making inventions. And now he\r\nhad stepped over the threshold of a new art which has since become so\r\nworld-wide in its application as to be an integral part of modern human\r\nexperience. [9]\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 9: The following extract from Walker on Patents\r\n     (4th edition) will probably be of interest to the reader:\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 31a. A meritorious exception, to the rule of the last\r\n     section, is involved in the adjudicated validity of the\r\n     Edison incandescent-light patent. The carbon filament, which\r\n     constitutes the only new part of the combination of the\r\n     second claim of that patent, differs from the earlier carbon\r\n     burners of Sawyer and Man, only in having a diameter of one-\r\n     sixty-fourth of an inch or less, whereas the burners of\r\n     Sawyer and Man had a diameter of one-thirty-second of an\r\n     inch or more. But that reduction of one-half in diameter\r\n     increased the resistance of the burner FOURFOLD, and reduced\r\n     its radiating surface TWOFOLD, and thus increased eightfold,\r\n     its ratio of resistance to radiating surface. That eightfold\r\n     increase of proportion enabled the resistance of the\r\n     conductor of electricity from the generator to the burner to\r\n     be increased eightfold, without any increase of percentage\r\n     of loss of energy in that conductor, or decrease of\r\n     percentage of development of heat in the burner; and thus\r\n     enabled the area of the cross-section of that conductor to\r\n     be reduced eightfold, and thus to be made with one-eighth of\r\n     the amount of copper or other metal, which would be required\r\n     if the reduction of diameter of the burner from one-thirty-\r\n     second to one-sixty-fourth of an inch had not been made. And\r\n     that great reduction in the size and cost of conductors,\r\n     involved also a great difference in the composition of the\r\n     electric energy employed in the system; that difference\r\n     consisting in generating the necessary amount of electrical\r\n     energy with comparatively high electromotive force, and\r\n     comparatively low current, instead of contrariwise. For this\r\n     reason, the use of carbon filaments, one-sixty-fourth of an\r\n     inch in diameter or less, instead of carbon burners one-\r\n     thirty-second of an inch in diameter or more, not only\r\n     worked an enormous economy in conductors, but also\r\n     necessitated a great change in generators, and did both\r\n     according to a philosophy, which Edison was the first to\r\n     know, and which is stated in this paragraph in its simplest\r\n     form and aspect, and which lies at the foundation of the\r\n     incandescent electric lighting of the world.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the truth of this new principle been established than\r\nthe work to establish it firmly and commercially was carried on\r\nmore assiduously than ever. The next immediate step was a further\r\ninvestigation of the possibilities of improving the quality of the\r\ncarbon filament. Edison had previously made a vast number of experiments\r\nwith carbonized paper for various electrical purposes, with such good\r\nresults that he once more turned to it and now made fine filament-like\r\nloops of this material which were put into other lamps. These proved\r\neven more successful (commercially considered) than the carbonized\r\nthread--so much so that after a number of such lamps had been made and\r\nput through severe tests, the manufacture of lamps from these paper\r\ncarbons was begun and carried on continuously. This necessitated first\r\nthe devising and making of a large number of special tools for cutting\r\nthe carbon filaments and for making and putting together the various\r\nparts of the lamps. Meantime, great excitement had been caused in this\r\ncountry and in Europe by the announcement of Edison's success. In the\r\nOld World, scientists generally still declared the impossibility of\r\nsubdividing the electric-light current, and in the public press Mr.\r\nEdison was denounced as a dreamer. Other names of a less complimentary\r\nnature were applied to him, even though his lamp were actually in\r\nuse, and the principle of commercial incandescent lighting had been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nBetween October 21, 1879, and December 21, 1879, some hundreds of these\r\npaper-carbon lamps had been made and put into actual use, not only in\r\nthe laboratory, but in the streets and several residences at Menlo Park,\r\nNew Jersey, causing great excitement and bringing many visitors from\r\nfar and near. On the latter date a full-page article appeared in the\r\nNew York Herald which so intensified the excited feeling that Mr. Edison\r\ndeemed it advisable to make a public exhibition. On New Year's Eve,\r\n1879, special trains were run to Menlo Park by the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, and over three thousand persons took advantage of the\r\nopportunity to go out there and witness this demonstration for\r\nthemselves. In this great crowd were many public officials and men of\r\nprominence in all walks of life, who were enthusiastic in their praises.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the mind that conceived and made practical this\r\ninvention could not rest content with anything less than perfection,\r\nso far as it could be realized. Edison was not satisfied with paper\r\ncarbons. They were not fully up to the ideal that he had in mind. What\r\nhe sought was a perfectly uniform and homogeneous carbon, one like the\r\n\"One-Hoss Shay,\" that had no weak spots to break down at inopportune\r\ntimes. He began to carbonize everything in nature that he could lay\r\nhands on. In his laboratory note-books are innumerable jottings of the\r\nthings that were carbonized and tried, such as tissue-paper, soft paper,\r\nall kinds of cardboards, drawing-paper of all grades, paper saturated\r\nwith tar, all kinds of threads, fish-line, threads rubbed with tarred\r\nlampblack, fine threads plaited together in strands, cotton soaked in\r\nboiling tar, lamp-wick, twine, tar and lampblack mixed with a proportion\r\nof lime, vulcanized fibre, celluloid, boxwood, cocoanut hair and shell,\r\nspruce, hickory, baywood, cedar and maple shavings, rosewood, punk,\r\ncork, bagging, flax, and a host of other things. He also extended his\r\nsearches far into the realms of nature in the line of grasses, plants,\r\ncanes, and similar products, and in these experiments at that time\r\nand later he carbonized, made into lamps, and tested no fewer than six\r\nthousand different species of vegetable growths.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for such prodigious research are not apparent on the face of\r\nthe subject, nor is this the occasion to enter into an explanation, as\r\nthat alone would be sufficient to fill a fair-sized book. Suffice it\r\nto say that Edison's omnivorous reading, keen observation, power of\r\nassimilating facts and natural phenomena, and skill in applying the\r\nknowledge thus attained to whatever was in hand, now came into full play\r\nin determining that the results he desired could only be obtained in\r\ncertain directions.\r\n\r\nAt this time he was investigating everything with a microscope, and one\r\nday in the early part of 1880 he noticed upon a table in the laboratory\r\nan ordinary palm-leaf fan. He picked it up and, looking it over,\r\nobserved that it had a binding rim made of bamboo, cut from the outer\r\nedge of the cane; a very long strip. He examined this, and then gave it\r\nto one of his assistants, telling him to cut it up and get out of it\r\nall the filaments he could, carbonize them, put them into lamps, and try\r\nthem. The results of this trial were exceedingly successful, far better\r\nthan with anything else thus far used; indeed, so much so, that after\r\nfurther experiments and microscopic examinations Edison was convinced\r\nthat he was now on the right track for making a thoroughly stable,\r\ncommercial lamp; and shortly afterward he sent a man to Japan to procure\r\nfurther supplies of bamboo. The fascinating story of the bamboo hunt\r\nwill be told later; but even this bamboo lamp was only one item of\r\na complete system to be devised--a system that has since completely\r\nrevolutionized the art of interior illumination.\r\n\r\nReference has been made in this chapter to the preliminary study that\r\nEdison brought to bear on the development of the gas art and industry.\r\nThis study was so exhaustive that one can only compare it to the careful\r\ninvestigation made in advance by any competent war staff of the elements\r\nof strength and weakness, on both sides, in a possible campaign. A\r\npopular idea of Edison that dies hard, pictures a breezy, slap-dash,\r\nenergetic inventor arriving at new results by luck and intuition, making\r\nboastful assertions and then winning out by mere chance. The native\r\nsimplicity of the man, the absence of pose and ceremony, do much to\r\nstrengthen this notion; but the real truth is that while gifted with\r\nunusual imagination, Edison's march to the goal of a new invention is\r\npositively humdrum and monotonous in its steady progress. No one ever\r\nsaw Edison in a hurry; no one ever saw him lazy; and that which he did\r\nwith slow, careful scrutiny six months ago, he will be doing with just\r\nas much calm deliberation of research six months hence--and six years\r\nhence if necessary. If, for instance, he were asked to find the most\r\nperfect pebble on the Atlantic shore of New Jersey, instead of hunting\r\nhere, there, and everywhere for the desired object, we would no doubt\r\nfind him patiently screening the entire beach, sifting out the most\r\nperfect stones and eventually, by gradual exclusion, reaching the\r\nlong-sought-for pebble; and the mere fact that in this search years\r\nmight be taken, would not lessen his enthusiasm to the slightest extent.\r\n\r\nIn the \"prospectus book\" among the series of famous note-books, all the\r\nreferences and data apply to gas. The book is numbered 184, falls into\r\nthe period now dealt with, and runs along casually with items spread\r\nout over two or three years. All these notes refer specifically to\r\n\"Electricity vs. Gas as General Illuminants,\" and cover an astounding\r\nrange of inquiry and comment. One of the very first notes tells the\r\nwhole story: \"Object, Edison to effect exact imitation of all done by\r\ngas, so as to replace lighting by gas by lighting by electricity. To\r\nimprove the illumination to such an extent as to meet all requirements\r\nof natural, artificial, and commercial conditions.\" A large programme,\r\nbut fully executed! The notes, it will be understood, are all in\r\nEdison's handwriting. They go on to observe that \"a general system of\r\ndistribution is the only possible means of economical illumination,\" and\r\nthey dismiss isolated-plant lighting as in mills and factories as of so\r\nlittle importance to the public--\"we shall leave the consideration of\r\nthis out of this book.\" The shrewd prophecy is made that gas will be\r\nmanufactured less for lighting, as the result of electrical competition,\r\nand more and more for heating, etc., thus enlarging its market and\r\nincreasing its income. Comment is made on kerosene and its cost, and all\r\nkinds of general statistics are jotted down as desirable. Data are to be\r\nobtained on lamp and dynamo efficiency, and \"Another review of the whole\r\nthing as worked out upon pure science principles by Rowland, Young,\r\nTrowbridge; also Rowland on the possibilities and probabilities of\r\ncheaper production by better manufacture--higher incandescence without\r\ndecrease of life of lamps.\" Notes are also made on meters and motors.\r\n\"It doesn't matter if electricity is used for light or for power\";\r\nwhile small motors, it is observed, can be used night or day, and small\r\nsteam-engines are inconvenient. Again the shrewd comment: \"Generally\r\npoorest district for light, best for power, thus evening up whole\r\ncity--the effect of this on investment.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pointed out that \"Previous inventions failed--necessities\r\nfor commercial success and accomplishment by Edison. Edison's great\r\neffort--not to make a large light or a blinding light, but a small light\r\nhaving the mildness of gas.\" Curves are then called for of iron\r\nand copper investment--also energy line--curves of candle-power and\r\nelectromotive force; curves on motors; graphic representation of\r\nthe consumption of gas January to December; tables and formulae;\r\nrepresentations graphically of what one dollar will buy in different\r\nkinds of light; \"table, weight of copper required different distance,\r\n100-ohm lamp, 16 candles\"; table with curves showing increased\r\neconomy by larger engine, higher power, etc. There is not much that is\r\ndilettante about all this. Note is made of an article in April, 1879,\r\nputting the total amount of gas investment in the whole world at that\r\ntime at $1,500,000,000; which is now (1910) about the amount of the\r\nelectric-lighting investment in the United States. Incidentally a note\r\nremarks: \"So unpleasant is the effect of the products of gas that in the\r\nnew Madison Square Theatre every gas jet is ventilated by special tubes\r\nto carry away the products of combustion.\" In short, there is no aspect\r\nof the new problem to which Edison failed to apply his acutest powers;\r\nand the speed with which the new system was worked out and introduced\r\nwas simply due to his initial mastery of all the factors in the older\r\nart. Luther Stieringer, an expert gas engineer and inventor, whose\r\nservices were early enlisted, once said that Edison knew more about gas\r\nthan any other man he had ever met. The remark is an evidence of the\r\nkind of preparation Edison gave himself for his new task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMEMORIES OF MENLO PARK\r\n\r\nFROM the spring of 1876 to 1886 Edison lived and did his work at Menlo\r\nPark; and at this stage of the narrative, midway in that interesting and\r\neventful period, it is appropriate to offer a few notes and jottings on\r\nthe place itself, around which tradition is already weaving its fancies,\r\njust as at the time the outpouring of new inventions from it invested\r\nthe name with sudden prominence and with the glamour of romance.\r\n\"In 1876 I moved,\" says Edison, \"to Menlo Park, New Jersey, on the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, several miles below Elizabeth. The move was due\r\nto trouble I had about rent. I had rented a small shop in Newark, on the\r\ntop floor of a padlock factory, by the month. I gave notice that I\r\nwould give it up at the end of the month, paid the rent, moved out,\r\nand delivered the keys. Shortly afterward I was served with a paper,\r\nprobably a judgment, wherein I was to pay nine months' rent. There was\r\nsome law, it seems, that made a monthly renter liable for a year. This\r\nseemed so unjust that I determined to get out of a place that permitted\r\nsuch injustice.\" For several Sundays he walked through different parts\r\nof New Jersey with two of his assistants before he decided on Menlo\r\nPark. The change was a fortunate one, for the inventor had married Miss\r\nMary E. Stillwell, and was now able to establish himself comfortably\r\nwith his wife and family while enjoying immediate access to the new\r\nlaboratory. Every moment thus saved was valuable.\r\n\r\nTo-day the place and region have gone back to the insignificance from\r\nwhich Edison's genius lifted them so startlingly. A glance from the\r\ncar windows reveals only a gently rolling landscape dotted with modest\r\nresidences and unpretentious barns; and there is nothing in sight by way\r\nof memorial to suggest that for nearly a decade this spot was the scene\r\nof the most concentrated and fruitful inventive activity the world has\r\never known. Close to the Menlo Park railway station is a group of\r\ngaunt and deserted buildings, shelter of the casual tramp, and slowly\r\ncrumbling away when not destroyed by the carelessness of some ragged\r\nsmoker. This silent group of buildings comprises the famous old\r\nlaboratory and workshops of Mr. Edison, historic as being the birthplace\r\nof the carbon transmitter, the phonograph, the incandescent lamp,\r\nand the spot where Edison also worked out his systems of electrical\r\ndistribution, his commercial dynamo, his electric railway, his\r\nmegaphone, his tasimeter, and many other inventions of greater or lesser\r\ndegree. Here he continued, moreover, his earlier work on the quadruplex,\r\nsextuplex, multiplex, and automatic telegraphs, and did his notable\r\npioneer work in wireless telegraphy. As the reader knows, it had been a\r\nmaster passion with Edison from boyhood up to possess a laboratory,\r\nin which with free use of his own time and powers, and with command of\r\nabundant material resources, he could wrestle with Nature and probe her\r\nclosest secrets. Thus, from the little cellar at Port Huron, from the\r\nscant shelves in a baggage car, from the nooks and corners of dingy\r\ntelegraph offices, and the grimy little shops in New York and Newark,\r\nhe had now come to the proud ownership of an establishment to which\r\nhis favorite word \"laboratory\" might justly be applied. Here he could\r\nexperiment to his heart's content and invent on a larger, bolder scale\r\nthan ever--and he did!\r\n\r\nMenlo Park was the merest hamlet. Omitting the laboratory structures, it\r\nhad only about seven houses, the best looking of which Edison lived in,\r\na place that had a windmill pumping water into a reservoir. One of the\r\nstories of the day was that Edison had his front gate so connected with\r\nthe pumping plant that every visitor as he opened or closed the gate\r\nadded involuntarily to the supply in the reservoir. Two or three of the\r\nhouses were occupied by the families of members of the staff; in the\r\nothers boarders were taken, the laboratory, of course, furnishing all\r\nthe patrons. Near the railway station was a small saloon kept by an old\r\nScotchman named Davis, where billiards were played in idle moments,\r\nand where in the long winter evenings the hot stove was a centre of\r\nattraction to loungers and story-tellers. The truth is that there\r\nwas very little social life of any kind possible under the strenuous\r\nconditions prevailing at the laboratory, where, if anywhere, relaxation\r\nwas enjoyed at odd intervals of fatigue and waiting.\r\n\r\nThe main laboratory was a spacious wooden building of two floors. The\r\noffice was in this building at first, until removed to the brick library\r\nwhen that was finished. There S. L. Griffin, an old telegraph friend\r\nof Edison, acted as his secretary and had charge of a voluminous and\r\namazing correspondence. The office employees were the Carman brothers\r\nand the late John F. Randolph, afterwards secretary. According to Mr.\r\nFrancis Jehl, of Budapest, then one of the staff, to whom the writers\r\nare indebted for a great deal of valuable data on this period: \"It\r\nwas on the upper story of this laboratory that the most important\r\nexperiments were executed, and where the incandescent lamp was born.\r\nThis floor consisted of a large hall containing several long tables,\r\nupon which could be found all the various instruments, scientific and\r\nchemical apparatus that the arts at that time could produce. Books\r\nlay promiscuously about, while here and there long lines of\r\nbichromate-of-potash cells could be seen, together with experimental\r\nmodels of ideas that Edison or his assistants were engaged upon. The\r\nside walls of this hall were lined with shelves filled with bottles,\r\nphials, and other receptacles containing every imaginable chemical and\r\nother material that could be obtained, while at the end of this hall,\r\nand near the organ which stood in the rear, was a large glass case\r\ncontaining the world's most precious metals in sheet and wire form,\r\ntogether with very rare and costly chemicals. When evening came on, and\r\nthe last rays of the setting sun penetrated through the side windows,\r\nthis hall looked like a veritable Faust laboratory.\r\n\r\n\"On the ground floor we had our testing-table, which stood on two large\r\npillars of brick built deep into the earth in order to get rid of all\r\nvibrations on account of the sensitive instruments that were upon it.\r\nThere was the Thomson reflecting mirror galvanometer and electrometer,\r\nwhile nearby were the standard cells by which the galvanometers were\r\nadjusted and standardized. This testing-table was connected by means\r\nof wires with all parts of the laboratory and machine-shop, so that\r\nmeasurements could be conveniently made from a distance, as in those\r\ndays we had no portable and direct-reading instruments, such as now\r\nexist. Opposite this table we installed, later on, our photometrical\r\nchamber, which was constructed on the Bunsen principle. A little way\r\nfrom this table, and separated by a partition, we had the chemical\r\nlaboratory with its furnaces and stink-chambers. Later on another\r\nchemical laboratory was installed near the photometer-room, and this Dr.\r\nA. Haid had charge of.\"\r\n\r\nNext to the laboratory in importance was the machine-shop, a large and\r\nwell-lighted building of brick, at one end of which there was the boiler\r\nand engine-room. This shop contained light and heavy lathes, boring and\r\ndrilling machines, all kinds of planing machines; in fact, tools of all\r\ndescriptions, so that any apparatus, however delicate or heavy, could be\r\nmade and built as might be required by Edison in experimenting. Mr. John\r\nKruesi had charge of this shop, and was assisted by a number of skilled\r\nmechanics, notably John Ott, whose deft fingers and quick intuitive\r\ngrasp of the master's ideas are still in demand under the more recent\r\nconditions at the Llewellyn Park laboratory in Orange.\r\n\r\nBetween the machine-shop and the laboratory was a small building of wood\r\nused as a carpenter-shop, where Tom Logan plied his art. Nearby was the\r\ngasoline plant. Before the incandescent lamp was perfected, the\r\nonly illumination was from gasoline gas; and that was used later\r\nfor incandescent-lamp glass-blowing, which was done in another small\r\nbuilding on one side of the laboratory. Apparently little or no lighting\r\nservice was obtained from the Wallace-Farmer arc lamps secured from\r\nAnsonia, Connecticut. The dynamo was probably needed for Edison's own\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of the property was a small building in which lampblack\r\nwas crudely but carefully manufactured and pressed into very small\r\ncakes, for use in the Edison carbon transmitters of that time. The\r\nnight-watchman, Alfred Swanson, took care of this curious plant, which\r\nconsisted of a battery of petroleum lamps that were forced to burn to\r\nthe sooting point. During his rounds in the night Swanson would find\r\ntime to collect from the chimneys the soot that the lamps gave. It was\r\nthen weighed out into very small portions, which were pressed into cakes\r\nor buttons by means of a hand-press. These little cakes were delicately\r\npacked away between layers of cotton in small, light boxes and shipped\r\nto Bergmann in New York, by whom the telephone transmitters were being\r\nmade. A little later the Edison electric railway was built on the\r\nconfines of the property out through the woods, at first only a third\r\nof a mile in length, but reaching ultimately to Pumptown, almost three\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison's own words may be quoted as to the men with whom he\r\nsurrounded himself here and upon whose services he depended principally\r\nfor help in the accomplishment of his aims. In an autobiographical\r\narticle in the Electrical World of March 5, 1904, he says: \"It is\r\ninteresting to note that in addition to those mentioned above (Charles\r\nBatchelor and Frank Upton), I had around me other men who ever since\r\nhave remained active in the field, such as Messrs. Francis Jehl, William\r\nJ. Hammer, Martin Force, Ludwig K. Boehm, not forgetting that good\r\nfriend and co-worker, the late John Kruesi. They found plenty to do in\r\nthe various developments of the art, and as I now look back I sometimes\r\nwonder how we did so much in so short a time.\" Mr. Jehl in his\r\nreminiscences adds another name to the above--namely, that of John W.\r\nLawson, and then goes on to say: \"These are the names of the pioneers of\r\nincandescent lighting, who were continuously at the side of Edison day\r\nand night for some years, and who, under his guidance, worked upon the\r\ncarbon-filament lamp from its birth to ripe maturity. These men all had\r\ncomplete faith in his ability and stood by him as on a rock, guarding\r\ntheir work with the secretiveness of a burglar-proof safe. Whenever it\r\nleaked out in the world that Edison was succeeding in his work on the\r\nelectric light, spies and others came to the Park; so it was of the\r\nutmost importance that the experiments and their results should be kept\r\na secret until Edison had secured the protection of the Patent Office.\"\r\nWith this staff was associated from the first Mr. E. H. Johnson, whose\r\nwork with Mr. Edison lay chiefly, however, outside the laboratory,\r\ntaking him to all parts of the country and to Europe. There were also\r\nto be regarded as detached members of it the Bergmann brothers,\r\nmanufacturing for Mr. Edison in New York, and incessantly experimenting\r\nfor him. In addition there must be included Mr. Samuel Insull, whose\r\nactivities for many years as private secretary and financial manager\r\nwere devoted solely to Mr. Edison's interests, with Menlo Park as a\r\ncentre and main source of anxiety as to pay-rolls and other constantly\r\nrecurring obligations. The names of yet other associates occur from\r\ntime to time in this narrative--\"Edison men\" who have been very proud\r\nof their close relationship to the inventor and his work at old Menlo.\r\n\"There was also Mr. Charles L. Clarke, who devoted himself mainly to\r\nengineering matters, and later on acted as chief engineer of the Edison\r\nElectric Light Company for some years. Then there were William Holzer\r\nand James Hipple, both of whom took an active part in the practical\r\ndevelopment of the glass-blowing department of the laboratory, and,\r\nsubsequently, at the first Edison lamp factory at Menlo Park. Later on\r\nMessrs. Jehl, Hipple, and Force assisted Mr. Batchelor to install the\r\nlamp-works of the French Edison Company at Ivry-sur-Seine. Then there\r\nwere Messrs. Charles T. Hughes, Samuel D. Mott, and Charles T. Mott, who\r\ndevoted their time chiefly to commercial affairs. Mr. Hughes conducted\r\nmost of this work, and later on took a prominent part in Edison's\r\nelectric-railway experiments. His business ability was on a high level,\r\nwhile his personal character endeared him to us all.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other now well-known men who came to us and assisted in various\r\nkinds of work were Messrs. Acheson, Worth, Crosby, Herrick, and Hill,\r\nwhile Doctor Haid was placed by Mr. Edison in charge of a special\r\nchemical laboratory. Dr. E. L. Nichols was also with us for a short time\r\nconducting a special series of experiments. There was also Mr. Isaacs,\r\nwho did a great deal of photographic work, and to whom we must be\r\nthankful for the pictures of Menlo Park in connection with Edison's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"Among others who were added to Mr. Kruesi's staff in the machine-shop\r\nwere Messrs. J. H. Vail and W. S. Andrews. Mr. Vail had charge of the\r\ndynamo-room. He had a good general knowledge of machinery, and very\r\nsoon acquired such familiarity with the dynamos that he could skip about\r\namong them with astonishing agility to regulate their brushes or to\r\nthrow rosin on the belts when they began to squeal. Later on he took\r\nan active part in the affairs and installations of the Edison Light\r\nCompany. Mr. Andrews stayed on Mr. Kruesi's staff as long as the\r\nlaboratory machine-shop was kept open, after which he went into the\r\nemploy of the Edison Electric Light Company and became actively engaged\r\nin the commercial and technical exploitation of the system. Another man\r\nwho was with us at Menlo Park was Mr. Herman Claudius, an Austrian, who\r\nat one time was employed in connection with the State Telegraphs of his\r\ncountry. To him Mr. Edison assigned the task of making a complete model\r\nof the network of conductors for the contemplated first station in New\r\nYork.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Francis R. Upton, who was early employed by Mr. Edison as his\r\nmathematician, furnishes a pleasant, vivid picture of his chief\r\nassociates engaged on the memorable work at Menlo Park. He says: \"Mr.\r\nCharles Batchelor was Mr. Edison's principal assistant at that time. He\r\nwas an Englishman, and came to this country to set up the thread-weaving\r\nmachinery for the Clark thread-works. He was a most intelligent,\r\npatient, competent, and loyal assistant to Mr. Edison. I remember\r\ndistinctly seeing him work many hours to mount a small filament; and\r\nhis hand would be as steady and his patience as unyielding at the end\r\nof those many hours as it was at the beginning, in spite of repeated\r\nfailures. He was a wonderful mechanic; the control that he had of his\r\nfingers was marvellous, and his eyesight was sharp. Mr. Batchelor's\r\njudgment and good sense were always in evidence.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Kruesi was the superintendent, a Swiss trained in the best Swiss\r\nideas of accuracy. He was a splendid mechanic with a vigorous temper,\r\nand wonderful ability to work continuously and to get work out of men.\r\nIt was an ideal combination, that of Edison, Batchelor, and Kruesi. Mr.\r\nEdison with his wonderful flow of ideas which were sharply defined in\r\nhis mind, as can be seen by any of the sketches that he made, as he\r\nevidently always thinks in three dimensions; Mr. Kruesi, willing to take\r\nthe ideas, and capable of comprehending them, would distribute the work\r\nso as to get it done with marvellous quickness and great accuracy.\r\nMr. Batchelor was always ready for any special fine experimenting or\r\nobservation, and could hold to whatever he was at as long as Mr. Edison\r\nwished; and always brought to bear on what he was at the greatest\r\nskill.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Edison depended upon Upton for his mathematical work, he was wont\r\nto check it up in a very practical manner, as evidenced by the following\r\nincident described by Mr. Jehl: \"I was once with Mr. Upton calculating\r\nsome tables which he had put me on, when Mr. Edison appeared with a\r\nglass bulb having a pear-shaped appearance in his hand. It was the kind\r\nthat we were going to use for our lamp experiments; and Mr. Edison asked\r\nMr. Upton to please calculate for him its cubic contents in centimetres.\r\nNow Mr. Upton was a very able mathematician, who, after he finished his\r\nstudies at Princeton, went to Germany and got his final gloss under that\r\ngreat master, Helmholtz. Whatever he did and worked on was executed in\r\na pure mathematical manner, and any wrangler at Oxford would have been\r\ndelighted to see him juggle with integral and differential equations,\r\nwith a dexterity that was surprising. He drew the shape of the bulb\r\nexactly on paper, and got the equation of its lines with which he was\r\ngoing to calculate its contents, when Mr. Edison again appeared and\r\nasked him what it was. He showed Edison the work he had already done on\r\nthe subject, and told him that he would very soon finish calculating\r\nit. 'Why,' said Edison, 'I would simply take that bulb and fill it\r\nwith mercury and weigh it; and from the weight of the mercury and its\r\nspecific gravity I'll get it in five minutes, and use less mental energy\r\nthan is necessary in such a fatiguing operation.'\"\r\n\r\nMenlo Park became ultimately the centre of Edison's business life as\r\nit was of his inventing. After the short distasteful period during the\r\nintroduction of his lighting system, when he spent a large part of his\r\ntime at the offices at 65 Fifth Avenue, New York, or on the actual work\r\nconnected with the New York Edison installation, he settled back again\r\nin Menlo Park altogether. Mr. Samuel Insull describes the business\r\nmethods which prevailed throughout the earlier Menlo Park days of \"storm\r\nand stress,\" and the curious conditions with which he had to deal as\r\nprivate secretary: \"I never attempted to systematize Edison's business\r\nlife. Edison's whole method of work would upset the system of any\r\noffice. He was just as likely to be at work in his laboratory at\r\nmidnight as midday. He cared not for the hours of the day or the days\r\nof the week. If he was exhausted he might more likely be asleep in the\r\nmiddle of the day than in the middle of the night, as most of his work\r\nin the way of inventions was done at night. I used to run his office on\r\nas close business methods as my experience admitted; and I would get at\r\nhim whenever it suited his convenience. Sometimes he would not go over\r\nhis mail for days at a time; but other times he would go regularly to\r\nhis office in the morning. At other times my engagements used to be with\r\nhim to go over his business affairs at Menlo Park at night, if I was\r\noccupied in New York during the day. In fact, as a matter of convenience\r\nI used more often to get at him at night, as it left my days free to\r\ntransact his affairs, and enabled me, probably at a midnight luncheon,\r\nto get a few minutes of his time to look over his correspondence and get\r\nhis directions as to what I should do in some particular negotiation or\r\nmatter of finance. While it was a matter of suiting Edison's convenience\r\nas to when I should transact business with him, it also suited my own\r\nideas, as it enabled me after getting through my business with him to\r\nenjoy the privilege of watching him at his work, and to learn something\r\nabout the technical side of matters. Whatever knowledge I may have of\r\nthe electric light and power industry I feel I owe it to the tuition of\r\nEdison. He was about the most willing tutor, and I must confess that he\r\nhad to be a patient one.\"\r\n\r\nHere again occurs the reference to the incessant night-work at Menlo\r\nPark, a note that is struck in every reminiscence and in every record\r\nof the time. But it is not to be inferred that the atmosphere of grim\r\ndetermination and persistent pursuit of the new invention characteristic\r\nof this period made life a burden to the small family of laborers\r\nassociated with Edison. Many a time during the long, weary nights of\r\nexperimenting Edison would call a halt for refreshments, which he had\r\nordered always to be sent in when night-work was in progress. Everything\r\nwould be dropped, all present would join in the meal, and the last good\r\nstory or joke would pass around. In his notes Mr. Jehl says: \"Our lunch\r\nalways ended with a cigar, and I may mention here that although Edison\r\nwas never fastidious in eating, he always relished a good cigar, and\r\nseemed to find in it consolation and solace.... It often happened that\r\nwhile we were enjoying the cigars after our midnight repast, one of the\r\nboys would start up a tune on the organ and we would all sing together,\r\nor one of the others would give a solo. Another of the boys had a voice\r\nthat sounded like something between the ring of an old tomato can and\r\na pewter jug. He had one song that he would sing while we roared with\r\nlaughter. He was also great in imitating the tin-foil phonograph....\r\nWhen Boehm was in good-humor he would play his zither now and then, and\r\namuse us by singing pretty German songs. On many of these occasions the\r\nlaboratory was the rendezvous of jolly and convivial visitors, mostly\r\nold friends and acquaintances of Mr. Edison. Some of the office\r\nemployees would also drop in once in a while, and as everybody present\r\nwas always welcome to partake of the midnight meal, we all enjoyed\r\nthese gatherings. After a while, when we were ready to resume work, our\r\nvisitors would intimate that they were going home to bed, but we fellows\r\ncould stay up and work, and they would depart, generally singing some\r\nsong like Good-night, ladies! . . . It often happened that when Edison\r\nhad been working up to three or four o'clock in the morning, he would\r\nlie down on one of the laboratory tables, and with nothing but a couple\r\nof books for a pillow, would fall into a sound sleep. He said it did\r\nhim more good than being in a soft bed, which spoils a man. Some of the\r\nlaboratory assistants could be seen now and then sleeping on a table in\r\nthe early morning hours. If their snoring became objectionable to those\r\nstill at work, the 'calmer' was applied. This machine consisted of\r\na Babbitt's soap box without a cover. Upon it was mounted a broad\r\nratchet-wheel with a crank, while into the teeth of the wheel there\r\nplayed a stout, elastic slab of wood. The box would be placed on the\r\ntable where the snorer was sleeping and the crank turned rapidly. The\r\nracket thus produced was something terrible, and the sleeper would jump\r\nup as though a typhoon had struck the laboratory. The irrepressible\r\nspirit of humor in the old days, although somewhat strenuous at times,\r\ncaused many a moment of hilarity which seemed to refresh the boys, and\r\nenabled them to work with renewed vigor after its manifestation.\" Mr.\r\nUpton remarks that often during the period of the invention of the\r\nincandescent lamp, when under great strain and fatigue, Edison would go\r\nto the organ and play tunes in a primitive way, and come back to crack\r\njokes with the staff. \"But I have often felt that Mr. Edison never could\r\ncomprehend the limitations of the strength of other men, as his own\r\nphysical and mental strength have always seemed to be without limit.\r\nHe could work continuously as long as he wished, and had sleep at his\r\ncommand. His sleep was always instant, profound, and restful. He\r\nhas told me that he never dreamed. I have known Mr. Edison now for\r\nthirty-one years, and feel that he has always kept his mind direct and\r\nsimple, going straight to the root of troubles. One of the peculiarities\r\nI have noticed is that I have never known him to break into a\r\nconversation going on around him, and ask what people were talking\r\nabout. The nearest he would ever come to it was when there had evidently\r\nbeen some story told, and his face would express a desire to join in the\r\nlaugh, which would immediately invite telling the story to him.\"\r\n\r\nNext to those who worked with Edison at the laboratory and were with\r\nhim constantly at Menlo Park were the visitors, some of whom were his\r\nbusiness associates, some of them scientific men, and some of them\r\nhero-worshippers and curiosity-hunters. Foremost in the first category\r\nwas Mr. E. H. Johnson, who was in reality Edison's most intimate friend,\r\nand was required for constant consultation; but whose intense activity,\r\nremarkable grasp of electrical principles, and unusual powers of\r\nexposition, led to his frequent detachment for long trips, including\r\nthose which resulted in the introduction of the telephone, phonograph,\r\nand electric light in England and on the Continent. A less frequent\r\nvisitor was Mr. S. Bergmann, who had all he needed to occupy his time\r\nin experimenting and manufacturing, and whose contemporaneous Wooster\r\nStreet letter-heads advertised Edison's inventions as being made there,\r\nAmong the scientists were Prof. George F. Barker, of Philadelphia, a\r\nbig, good-natured philosopher, whose valuable advice Edison esteemed\r\nhighly. In sharp contrast to him was the earnest, serious Rowland, of\r\nJohns Hopkins University, afterward the leading American physicist of\r\nhis day. Profs. C. F. Brackett and C. F. Young, of Princeton University,\r\nwere often received, always interested in what Edison was doing, and\r\nproud that one of their own students, Mr. Upton, was taking such a\r\nprominent part in the development of the work.\r\n\r\nSoon after the success of the lighting experiments and the installation\r\nat Menlo Park became known, Edison was besieged by persons from all\r\nparts of the world anxious to secure rights and concessions for their\r\nrespective countries. Among these was Mr. Louis Rau, of Paris, who\r\norganized the French Edison Company, the pioneer Edison lighting\r\ncorporation in Europe, and who, with the aid of Mr. Batchelor,\r\nestablished lamp-works and a machine-shop at Ivry sur-Seine, near Paris,\r\nin 1882. It was there that Mr. Nikola Tesla made his entree into the\r\nfield of light and power, and began his own career as an inventor; and\r\nthere also Mr. Etienne Fodor, general manager of the Hungarian General\r\nElectric Company at Budapest, received his early training. It was he who\r\nerected at Athens the first European Edison station on the now universal\r\nthree-wire system. Another visitor from Europe, a little later, was\r\nMr. Emil Rathenau, the present director of the great Allgemeine\r\nElektricitaets Gesellschaft of Germany. He secured the rights for the\r\nempire, and organized the Berlin Edison system, now one of the largest\r\nin the world. Through his extraordinary energy and enterprise the\r\nbusiness made enormous strides, and Mr. Rathenau has become one of the\r\nmost conspicuous industrial figures in his native country. From Italy\r\ncame Professor Colombo, later a cabinet minister, with his friend Signor\r\nBuzzi, of Milan. The rights were secured for the peninsula; Colombo and\r\nhis friends organized the Italian Edison Company, and erected at Milan\r\nthe first central station in that country. Mr. John W. Lieb, Jr., now\r\na vice-president of the New York Edison Company, was sent over by Mr.\r\nEdison to steer the enterprise technically, and spent ten years in\r\nbuilding it up, with such brilliant success that he was later decorated\r\nas Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy by King Victor. Another\r\nyoung American enlisted into European service was Mr. E. G. Acheson,\r\nthe inventor of carborundum, who built a number of plants in Italy and\r\nFrance before he returned home. Mr. Lieb has since become President of\r\nthe American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Association of\r\nEdison Illuminating Companies, while Doctor Acheson has been President\r\nof the American Electrochemical Society.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland sent Messrs. Turrettini, Biedermann, and Thury, all\r\ndistinguished engineers, to negotiate for rights in the republic; and\r\nso it went with regard to all the other countries of Europe, as well as\r\nthose of South America. It was a question of keeping such visitors away\r\nrather than of inviting them to take up the exploitation of the Edison\r\nsystem; for what time was not spent in personal interviews was required\r\nfor the masses of letters from every country under the sun, all making\r\ninquiries, offering suggestions, proposing terms. Nor were the\r\nvisitors merely those on business bent. There were the lion-hunters and\r\ncelebrities, of whom Sarah Bernhardt may serve as a type. One visit\r\nof note was that paid by Lieut. G. W. De Long, who had an earnest and\r\nprotracted conversation with Edison over the Arctic expedition he was\r\nundertaking with the aid of Mr. James Gordon Bennett, of the New York\r\nHerald. The Jeannette was being fitted out, and Edison told De Long\r\nthat he would make and present him with a small dynamo machine, some\r\nincandescent lamps, and an arc lamp. While the little dynamo was being\r\nbuilt all the men in the laboratory wrote their names on the paper\r\ninsulation that was wound upon the iron core of the armature. As the\r\nJeannette had no steam-engine on board that could be used for the\r\npurpose, Edison designed the dynamo so that it could be worked by man\r\npower and told Lieutenant De Long \"it would keep the boys warm up in the\r\nArctic,\" when they generated current with it. The ill-fated ship never\r\nreturned from her voyage, but went down in the icy waters of the North,\r\nthere to remain until some future cataclysm of nature, ten thousand\r\nyears hence, shall reveal the ship and the first marine dynamo as\r\ncurious relics of a remote civilization.\r\n\r\nEdison also furnished De Long with a set of telephones provided with\r\nextensible circuits, so that parties on the ice-floes could go long\r\ndistances from the ship and still keep in communication with her. So\r\nfar as the writers can ascertain this is the first example of \"field\r\ntelephony.\" Another nautical experiment that he made at this time,\r\nsuggested probably by the requirements of the Arctic expedition, was a\r\nbuoy that was floated in New York harbor, and which contained a small\r\nEdison dynamo and two or three incandescent lamps. The dynamo was driven\r\nby the wave or tide motion through intermediate mechanism, and thus the\r\nlamps were lit up from time to time, serving as signals. These were the\r\nprototypes of the lighted buoys which have since become familiar, as in\r\nthe channel off Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\nOne notable afternoon was that on which the New York board of aldermen\r\ntook a special train out to Menlo Park to see the lighting system\r\nwith its conductors underground in operation. The Edison Electric\r\nIlluminating Company was applying for a franchise, and the aldermen,\r\nfor lack of scientific training and specific practical information, were\r\nvery sceptical on the subject--as indeed they might well be. \"Mr. Edison\r\ndemonstrated personally the details and merits of the system to them.\r\nThe voltage was increased to a higher pressure than usual, and all the\r\nincandescent lamps at Menlo Park did their best to win the approbation\r\nof the New York City fathers. After Edison had finished exhibiting all\r\nthe good points of his system, he conducted his guests upstairs in the\r\nlaboratory, where a long table was spread with the best things that one\r\nof the most prominent New York caterers could furnish. The laboratory\r\nwitnessed high times that night, for all were in the best of humor,\r\nand many a bottle was drained in toasting the health of Edison and the\r\naldermen.\" This was one of the extremely rare occasions on which Edison\r\nhas addressed an audience; but the stake was worth the effort. The\r\nrepresentatives of New York could with justice drink the health of the\r\nyoung inventor, whose system is one of the greatest boons the city has\r\never had conferred upon it.\r\n\r\nAmong other frequent visitors was Mr, Edison's father, \"one of those\r\namiable, patriarchal characters with a Horace Greeley beard, typical\r\nAmericans of the old school,\" who would sometimes come into the\r\nlaboratory with his two grandchildren, a little boy and girl called\r\n\"Dash\" and \"Dot.\" He preferred to sit and watch his brilliant son at\r\nwork \"with an expression of satisfaction on his face that indicated\r\na sense of happiness and content that his boy, born in that distant,\r\nhumble home in Ohio, had risen to fame and brought such honor upon the\r\nname. It was, indeed, a pathetic sight to see a father venerate his son\r\nas the elder Edison did.\" Not less at home was Mr. Mackenzie, the Mt.\r\nClemens station agent, the life of whose child Edison had saved when\r\na train newsboy. The old Scotchman was one of the innocent, chartered\r\nlibertines of the place, with an unlimited stock of good jokes and\r\nstories, but seldom of any practical use. On one occasion, however, when\r\neverything possible and impossible under the sun was being carbonized\r\nfor lamp filaments, he allowed a handful of his bushy red beard to\r\nbe taken for the purpose; and his laugh was the loudest when the\r\nEdison-Mackenzie hair lamps were brought up to incandescence--their\r\nrichness in red rays being slyly attributed to the nature of the\r\nfilamentary material! Oddly enough, a few years later, some inventor\r\nactually took out a patent for making incandescent lamps with carbonized\r\nhair for filaments!\r\n\r\nYet other visitors again haunted the place, and with the following\r\nreminiscence of one of them, from Mr. Edison himself, this part of the\r\nchapter must close: \"At Menlo Park one cold winter night there came into\r\nthe laboratory a strange man in a most pitiful condition. He was nearly\r\nfrozen, and he asked if he might sit by the stove. In a few moments\r\nhe asked for the head man, and I was brought forward. He had a head of\r\nabnormal size, with highly intellectual features and a very small and\r\nemaciated body. He said he was suffering very much, and asked if I\r\nhad any morphine. As I had about everything in chemistry that could be\r\nbought, I told him I had. He requested that I give him some, so I got\r\nthe morphine sulphate. He poured out enough to kill two men, when I told\r\nhim that we didn't keep a hotel for suicides, and he had better cut the\r\nquantity down. He then bared his legs and arms, and they were literally\r\npitted with scars, due to the use of hypodermic syringes. He said he had\r\ntaken it for years, and it required a big dose to have any effect. I let\r\nhim go ahead. In a short while he seemed like another man and began to\r\ntell stories, and there were about fifty of us who sat around listening\r\nuntil morning. He was a man of great intelligence and education. He\r\nsaid he was a Jew, but there was no distinctive feature to verify\r\nthis assertion. He continued to stay around until he finished every\r\ncombination of morphine with an acid that I had, probably ten ounces all\r\ntold. Then he asked if he could have strychnine. I had an ounce of the\r\nsulphate. He took enough to kill a horse, and asserted it had as good an\r\neffect as morphine. When this was gone, the only thing I had left was a\r\nchunk of crude opium, perhaps two or three pounds. He chewed this up and\r\ndisappeared. I was greatly disappointed, because I would have laid in\r\nanother stock of morphine to keep him at the laboratory. About a week\r\nafterward he was found dead in a barn at Perth Amboy.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to the work itself, note of which has already been made\r\nin this and preceding chapters, we find an interesting and unique\r\nreminiscence in Mr. Jehl's notes of the reversion to carbon as a\r\nfilament in the lamps, following an exhibition of metallic-filament\r\nlamps given in the spring of 1879 to the men in the syndicate advancing\r\nthe funds for these experiments: \"They came to Menlo Park on a late\r\nafternoon train from New York. It was already dark when they were\r\nconducted into the machine-shop, where we had several platinum lamps\r\ninstalled in series. When Edison had finished explaining the principles\r\nand details of the lamp, he asked Kruesi to let the dynamo machine run.\r\nIt was of the Gramme type, as our first dynamo of the Edison design\r\nwas not yet finished. Edison then ordered the 'juice' to be turned\r\non slowly. To-day I can see those lamps rising to a cherry red, like\r\nglowbugs, and hear Mr. Edison saying 'a little more juice,' and the\r\nlamps began to glow. 'A little more' is the command again, and then one\r\nof the lamps emits for an instant a light like a star in the distance,\r\nafter which there is an eruption and a puff; and the machine-shop is in\r\ntotal darkness. We knew instantly which lamp had failed, and Batchelor\r\nreplaced that by a good one, having a few in reserve near by. The\r\noperation was repeated two or three times with about the same results,\r\nafter which the party went into the library until it was time to catch\r\nthe train for New York.\"\r\n\r\nSuch an exhibition was decidedly discouraging, and it was not a jubilant\r\nparty that returned to New York, but: \"That night Edison remained in the\r\nlaboratory meditating upon the results that the platinum lamp had given\r\nso far. I was engaged reading a book near a table in the front, while\r\nEdison was seated in a chair by a table near the organ. With his head\r\nturned downward, and that conspicuous lock of hair hanging loosely on\r\none side, he looked like Napoleon in the celebrated picture, On the\r\nEve of a Great Battle. Those days were heroic ones, for he then\r\nbattled against mighty odds, and the prospects were dim and not very\r\nencouraging. In cases of emergency Edison always possessed a keen\r\nfaculty of deciding immediately and correctly what to do; and the\r\ndecision he then arrived at was predestined to be the turning-point\r\nthat led him on to ultimate success.... After that exhibition we had a\r\nhouse-cleaning at the laboratory, and the metallic-filament lamps were\r\nstored away, while preparations were made for our experiments on carbon\r\nlamps.\"\r\n\r\nThus the work went on. Menlo Park has hitherto been associated in the\r\npublic thought with the telephone, phonograph, and incandescent\r\nlamp; but it was there, equally, that the Edison dynamo and system of\r\ndistribution were created and applied to their specific purposes. While\r\nall this study of a possible lamp was going on, Mr. Upton was busy\r\ncalculating the economy of the \"multiple arc\" system, and making a great\r\nmany tables to determine what resistance a lamp should have for the best\r\nresults, and at what point the proposed general system would fall off\r\nin economy when the lamps were of the lower resistance that was then\r\ngenerally assumed to be necessary. The world at that time had not the\r\nshadow of an idea as to what the principles of a multiple arc system\r\nshould be, enabling millions of lamps to be lighted off distributing\r\ncircuits, each lamp independent of every other; but at Menlo Park at\r\nthat remote period in the seventies Mr. Edison's mathematician was\r\nformulating the inventor's conception in clear, instructive figures;\r\n\"and the work then executed has held its own ever since.\" From the\r\nbeginning of his experiments on electric light, Mr. Edison had a\r\nwell-defined idea of producing not only a practicable lamp, but also\r\na SYSTEM of commercial electric lighting. Such a scheme involved the\r\ncreation of an entirely new art, for there was nothing on the face of\r\nthe earth from which to draw assistance or precedent, unless we except\r\nthe elementary forms of dynamos then in existence. It is true, there\r\nwere several types of machines in use for the then very limited field of\r\narc lighting, but they were regarded as valueless as a part of a great\r\ncomprehensive scheme which could supply everybody with light. Such\r\nmachines were confessedly inefficient, although representing the\r\nfarthest reach of a young art. A commission appointed at that time by\r\nthe Franklin Institute, and including Prof. Elihu Thomson, investigated\r\nthe merits of existing dynamos and reported as to the best of them: \"The\r\nGramme machine is the most economical as a means of converting motive\r\nforce into electricity; it utilizes in the arc from 38 to 41 per cent.\r\nof the motive work produced, after deduction is made for friction\r\nand the resistance of the air.\" They reported also that the Brush arc\r\nlighting machine \"produces in the luminous arc useful work equivalent to\r\n31 per cent. of the motive power employed, or to 38 1/2 per cent. after\r\nthe friction has been deducted.\" Commercial possibilities could not\r\nexist in the face of such low economy as this, and Mr. Edison realized\r\nthat he would have to improve the dynamo himself if he wanted a better\r\nmachine. The scientific world at that time was engaged in a controversy\r\nregarding the external and internal resistance of a circuit in which\r\na generator was situated. Discussing the subject Mr. Jehl, in his\r\nbiographical notes, says: \"While this controversy raged in the\r\nscientific papers, and criticism and confusion seemed at its height,\r\nEdison and Upton discussed this question very thoroughly, and Edison\r\ndeclared he did not intend to build up a system of distribution in which\r\nthe external resistance would be equal to the internal resistance.\r\nHe said he was just about going to do the opposite; he wanted a large\r\nexternal resistance and a low internal one. He said he wanted to sell\r\nthe energy outside of the station and not waste it in the dynamo and\r\nconductors, where it brought no profits.... In these later days, when\r\nthese ideas of Edison are used as common property, and are applied in\r\nevery modern system of distribution, it is astonishing to remember that\r\nwhen they were propounded they met with most vehement antagonism from\r\nthe world at large.\" Edison, familiar with batteries in telegraphy,\r\ncould not bring himself to believe that any substitute generator of\r\nelectrical energy could be efficient that used up half its own possible\r\noutput before doing an equal amount of outside work.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by the dicta of contemporaneous science, Mr. Edison attacked\r\nthe dynamo problem with his accustomed vigor and thoroughness. He chose\r\nthe drum form for his armature, and experimented with different kinds\r\nof iron. Cores were made of cast iron, others of forged iron; and still\r\nothers of sheets of iron of various thicknesses separated from each\r\nother by paper or paint. These cores were then allowed to run in an\r\nexcited field, and after a given time their temperature was measured and\r\nnoted. By such practical methods Edison found that the thin, laminated\r\ncores of sheet iron gave the least heat, and had the least amount of\r\nwasteful eddy currents. His experiments and ideas on magnetism at that\r\nperiod were far in advance of the time. His work and tests regarding\r\nmagnetism were repeated later on by Hopkinson and Kapp, who then\r\nelucidated the whole theory mathematically by means of formulae and\r\nconstants. Before this, however, Edison had attained these results by\r\npioneer work, founded on his original reasoning, and utilized them in\r\nthe construction of his dynamo, thus revolutionizing the art of building\r\nsuch machines.\r\n\r\nAfter thorough investigation of the magnetic qualities of different\r\nkinds of iron, Edison began to make a study of winding the cores,\r\nfirst determining the electromotive force generated per turn of wire at\r\nvarious speeds in fields of different intensities. He also considered\r\nvarious forms and shapes for the armature, and by methodical and\r\nsystematic research obtained the data and best conditions upon which\r\nhe could build his generator. In the field magnets of his dynamo he\r\nconstructed the cores and yoke of forged iron having a very large\r\ncross-section, which was a new thing in those days. Great attention was\r\nalso paid to all the joints, which were smoothed down so as to make a\r\nperfect magnetic contact. The Edison dynamo, with its large masses of\r\niron, was a vivid contrast to the then existing types with their meagre\r\nquantities of the ferric element. Edison also made tests on his field\r\nmagnets by slowly raising the strength of the exciting current, so that\r\nhe obtained figures similar to those shown by a magnetic curve, and in\r\nthis way found where saturation commenced, and where it was useless to\r\nexpend more current on the field. If he had asked Upton at the time to\r\nformulate the results of his work in this direction, for publication, he\r\nwould have anticipated the historic work on magnetism that was executed\r\nby the two other investigators; Hopkinson and Kapp, later on.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory note-books of the period bear abundant evidence of the\r\nsystematic and searching nature of these experiments and investigations,\r\nin the hundreds of pages of notes, sketches, calculations, and tables\r\nmade at the time by Edison, Upton, Batchelor, Jehl, and by others who\r\nfrom time to time were intrusted with special experiments to\r\nelucidate some particular point. Mr. Jehl says: \"The experiments on\r\narmature-winding were also very interesting. Edison had a number of\r\nsmall wooden cores made, at both ends of which we inserted little brass\r\nnails, and we wound the wooden cores with twine as if it were wire on an\r\narmature. In this way we studied armature-winding, and had matches where\r\neach of us had a core, while bets were made as to who would be the first\r\nto finish properly and correctly a certain kind of winding. Care had\r\nto be taken that the wound core corresponded to the direction of the\r\ncurrent, supposing it were placed in a field and revolved. After Edison\r\nhad decided this question, Upton made drawings and tables from which the\r\nreal armatures were wound and connected to the commutator. To a\r\nstudent of to-day all this seems simple, but in those days the art\r\nof constructing dynamos was about as dark as air navigation is at\r\npresent.... Edison also improved the armature by dividing it and the\r\ncommutator into a far greater number of sections than up to that time\r\nhad been the practice. He was also the first to use mica in insulating\r\nthe commutator sections from each other.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, during the progress of the investigations on the\r\ndynamo, word had gone out to the world that Edison expected to invent a\r\ngenerator of greater efficiency than any that existed at the time. Again\r\nhe was assailed and ridiculed by the technical press, for had not the\r\nforemost electricians and physicists of Europe and America worked for\r\nyears on the production of dynamos and arc lamps as they then existed?\r\nEven though this young man at Menlo Park had done some wonderful things\r\nfor telegraphy and telephony; even if he had recorded and reproduced\r\nhuman speech, he had his limitations, and could not upset the settled\r\ndictum of science that the internal resistance must equal the external\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nSuch was the trend of public opinion at the time, but \"after Mr. Kruesi\r\nhad finished the first practical dynamo, and after Mr. Upton had tested\r\nit thoroughly and verified his figures and results several times--for he\r\nalso was surprised--Edison was able to tell the world that he had made\r\na generator giving an efficiency of 90 per cent.\" Ninety per cent. as\r\nagainst 40 per cent. was a mighty hit, and the world would not believe\r\nit. Criticism and argument were again at their height, while Upton,\r\nas Edison's duellist, was kept busy replying to private and public\r\nchallenges of the fact.... \"The tremendous progress of the world in\r\nthe last quarter of a century, owing to the revolution caused by the\r\nall-conquering march of 'Heavy Current Engineering,' is the outcome of\r\nEdison's work at Menlo Park that raised the efficiency of the dynamo\r\nfrom 40 per cent. to 90 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Upton sums it all up very precisely in his remarks upon this period:\r\n\"What has now been made clear by accurate nomenclature was then very\r\nfoggy in the text-books. Mr. Edison had completely grasped the effect\r\nof subdivision of circuits, and the influence of wires leading to such\r\nsubdivisions, when it was most difficult to express what he knew in\r\ntechnical language. I remember distinctly when Mr. Edison gave me the\r\nproblem of placing a motor in circuit in multiple arc with a fixed\r\nresistance; and I had to work out the problem entirely, as I could\r\nfind no prior solution. There was nothing I could find bearing upon\r\nthe counter electromotive force of the armature, and the effect of the\r\nresistance of the armature on the work given out by the armature. It was\r\na wonderful experience to have problems given me out of the intuitions\r\nof a great mind, based on enormous experience in practical work, and\r\napplying to new lines of progress. One of the main impressions left upon\r\nme after knowing Mr. Edison for many years is the marvellous accuracy of\r\nhis guesses. He will see the general nature of a result long before it\r\ncan be reached by mathematical calculation. His greatness was always to\r\nbe clearly seen when difficulties arose. They always made him cheerful,\r\nand started him thinking; and very soon would come a line of suggestions\r\nwhich would not end until the difficulty was met and overcome, or found\r\ninsurmountable. I have often felt that Mr. Edison got himself purposely\r\ninto trouble by premature publications and otherwise, so that he would\r\nhave a full incentive to get himself out of the trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThis chapter may well end with a statement from Mr. Jehl, shrewd and\r\nobservant, as a participator in all the early work of the development of\r\nthe Edison lighting system: \"Those who were gathered around him in the\r\nold Menlo Park laboratory enjoyed his confidence, and he theirs. Nor was\r\nthis confidence ever abused. He was respected with a respect which only\r\ngreat men can obtain, and he never showed by any word or act that he was\r\ntheir employer in a sense that would hurt the feelings, as is often the\r\ncase in the ordinary course of business life. He conversed, argued, and\r\ndisputed with us all as if he were a colleague on the same footing. It\r\nwas his winning ways and manners that attached us all so loyally to his\r\nside, and made us ever ready with a boundless devotion to execute any\r\nrequest or desire.\" Thus does a great magnet, run through a heap of sand\r\nand filings, exert its lines of force and attract irresistibly to itself\r\nthe iron and steel particles that are its affinity, and having sifted\r\nthem out, leaving the useless dust behind, hold them to itself with\r\nresponsive tenacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA WORLD-HUNT FOR FILAMENT MATERIAL\r\n\r\nIN writing about the old experimenting days at Menlo Park, Mr. F. R.\r\nUpton says: \"Edison's day is twenty-four hours long, for he has always\r\nworked whenever there was anything to do, whether day or night, and\r\ncarried a force of night workers, so that his experiments could go on\r\ncontinually. If he wanted material, he always made it a principle to\r\nhave it at once, and never hesitated to use special messengers to get\r\nit. I remember in the early days of the electric light he wanted a\r\nmercury pump for exhausting the lamps. He sent me to Princeton to get\r\nit. I got back to Metuchen late in the day, and had to carry the pump\r\nover to the laboratory on my back that evening, set it up, and work all\r\nnight and the next day getting results.\"\r\n\r\nThis characteristic principle of obtaining desired material in the\r\nquickest and most positive way manifested itself in the search that\r\nEdison instituted for the best kind of bamboo for lamp filaments,\r\nimmediately after the discovery related in a preceding chapter. It is\r\ndoubtful whether, in the annals of scientific research and experiment,\r\nthere is anything quite analogous to the story of this search and the\r\nvarious expeditions that went out from the Edison laboratory in 1880 and\r\nsubsequent years, to scour the earth for a material so apparently simple\r\nas a homogeneous strip of bamboo, or other similar fibre. Prolonged\r\nand exhaustive experiment, microscopic examination, and an intimate\r\nknowledge of the nature of wood and plant fibres, however, had led\r\nEdison to the conclusion that bamboo or similar fibrous filaments were\r\nmore suitable than anything else then known for commercial incandescent\r\nlamps, and he wanted the most perfect for that purpose. Hence, the\r\nquickest way was to search the tropics until the proper material was\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe first emissary chosen for this purpose was the late William H.\r\nMoore, of Rahway, New Jersey, who left New York in the summer of 1880,\r\nbound for China and Japan, these being the countries preeminently noted\r\nfor the production of abundant species of bamboo. On arrival in the\r\nEast he quickly left the cities behind and proceeded into the interior,\r\nextending his search far into the more remote country districts,\r\ncollecting specimens on his way, and devoting much time to the study of\r\nthe bamboo, and in roughly testing the relative value of its fibre in\r\ncanes of one, two, three, four, and five year growths. Great bales of\r\nsamples were sent to Edison, and after careful tests a certain variety\r\nand growth of Japanese bamboo was determined to be the most satisfactory\r\nmaterial for filaments that had been found. Mr. Moore, who was\r\ncontinuing his searches in that country, was instructed to arrange for\r\nthe cultivation and shipment of regular supplies of this particular\r\nspecies. Arrangements to this end were accordingly made with a Japanese\r\nfarmer, who began to make immediate shipments, and who subsequently\r\ndisplayed so much ingenuity in fertilizing and cross-fertilizing that\r\nthe homogeneity of the product was constantly improved. The use of this\r\nbamboo for Edison lamp filaments was continued for many years.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Moore did not meet with the exciting adventures of some\r\nsubsequent explorers, he encountered numerous difficulties and novel\r\nexperiences in his many months of travel through the hinterland of Japan\r\nand China. The attitude toward foreigners thirty years ago was not as\r\nfriendly as it has since become, but Edison, as usual, had made a happy\r\nchoice of messengers, as Mr. Moore's good nature and diplomacy attested.\r\nThese qualities, together with his persistence and perseverance and\r\nfaculty of intelligent discrimination in the matter of fibres, helped to\r\nmake his mission successful, and gave to him the honor of being the\r\none who found the bamboo which was adopted for use as filaments in\r\ncommercial Edison lamps.\r\n\r\nAlthough Edison had satisfied himself that bamboo furnished the most\r\ndesirable material thus far discovered for incandescent-lamp filaments,\r\nhe felt that in some part of the world there might be found a natural\r\nproduct of the same general character that would furnish a still more\r\nperfect and homogeneous material. In his study of this subject, and\r\nduring the prosecution of vigorous and searching inquiries in various\r\ndirections, he learned that Mr. John C. Brauner, then residing in\r\nBrooklyn, New York, had an expert knowledge of indigenous plants of the\r\nparticular kind desired. During the course of a geological survey which\r\nhe had made for the Brazilian Government, Mr. Brauner had examined\r\nclosely the various species of palms which grow plentifully in that\r\ncountry, and of them there was one whose fibres he thought would be just\r\nwhat Edison wanted.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Mr. Brauner was sent for and dispatched to Brazil in\r\nDecember, 1880, to search for and send samples of this and such other\r\npalms, fibres, grasses, and canes as, in his judgment, would be suitable\r\nfor the experiments then being carried on at Menlo Park. Landing at\r\nPara, he crossed over into the Amazonian province, and thence proceeded\r\nthrough the heart of the country, making his way by canoe on the rivers\r\nand their tributaries, and by foot into the forests and marshes of\r\na vast and almost untrodden wilderness. In this manner Mr. Brauner\r\ntraversed about two thousand miles of the comparatively unknown interior\r\nof Southern Brazil, and procured a large variety of fibrous specimens,\r\nwhich he shipped to Edison a few months later. When these fibres arrived\r\nin the United States they were carefully tested and a few of them found\r\nsuitable but not superior to the Japanese bamboo, which was then being\r\nexclusively used in the manufacture of commercial Edison lamps.\r\n\r\nLater on Edison sent out an expedition to explore the wilds of Cuba and\r\nJamaica. A two months' investigation of the latter island revealed a\r\nvariety of bamboo growths, of which a great number of specimens were\r\nobtained and shipped to Menlo Park; but on careful test they were found\r\ninferior to the Japanese bamboo, and hence rejected. The exploration of\r\nthe glades and swamps of Florida by three men extended over a period\r\nof five months in a minute search for fibrous woods of the palmetto\r\nspecies. A great variety was found, and over five hundred boxes of\r\nspecimens were shipped to the laboratory from time to time, but none of\r\nthem tested out with entirely satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe use of Japanese bamboo for carbon filaments was therefore continued\r\nin the manufacture of lamps, although an incessant search was maintained\r\nfor a still more perfect material. The spirit of progress, so pervasive\r\nin Edison's character, led him, however, to renew his investigations\r\nfurther afield by sending out two other men to examine the bamboo and\r\nsimilar growths of those parts of South America not covered by Mr.\r\nBrauner. These two men were Frank McGowan and C. F. Hanington, both\r\nof whom had been for nearly seven years in the employ of the Edison\r\nElectric Light Company in New York. The former was a stocky, rugged\r\nIrishman, possessing the native shrewdness and buoyancy of his race,\r\ncoupled with undaunted courage and determination; and the latter was\r\na veteran of the Civil War, with some knowledge of forest and field,\r\nacquired as a sportsman. They left New York in September, 1887, arriving\r\nin due time at Para, proceeding thence twenty-three hundred miles up the\r\nAmazon River to Iquitos. Nothing of an eventful nature occurred during\r\nthis trip, but on arrival at Iquitos the two men separated; Mr. McGowan\r\nto explore on foot and by canoe in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, while\r\nMr. Hanington returned by the Amazon River to Para. Thence Hanington\r\nwent by steamer to Montevideo, and by similar conveyance up the River\r\nde la Plata and through Uruguay, Argentine, and Paraguay to the\r\nsouthernmost part of Brazil, collecting a large number of specimens of\r\npalms and grasses.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of Mr. McGowan, after leaving Iquitos, would fill a book\r\nif related in detail. The object of the present narrative and the space\r\nat the authors' disposal, however, do not permit of more than a brief\r\nmention of his experiences. His first objective point was Quito, about\r\nfive hundred miles away, which he proposed to reach on foot and by means\r\nof canoeing on the Napo River through a wild and comparatively unknown\r\ncountry teeming with tribes of hostile natives. The dangers of the\r\nexpedition were pictured to him in glowing colors, but spurning\r\nprophecies of dire disaster, he engaged some native Indians and a canoe\r\nand started on his explorations, reaching Quito in eighty-seven days,\r\nafter a thorough search of the country on both sides of the Napo River.\r\nFrom Quito he went to Guayaquil, from there by steamer to Buenaventura,\r\nand thence by rail, twelve miles, to Cordova. From this point he set out\r\non foot to explore the Cauca Valley and the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nMr. McGowan found in these regions a great variety of bamboo, small and\r\nlarge, some species growing seventy-five to one hundred feet in height,\r\nand from six to nine inches in diameter. He collected a large number\r\nof specimens, which were subsequently sent to Orange for Edison's\r\nexamination. After about fifteen months of exploration attended by much\r\nhardship and privation, deserted sometimes by treacherous guides, twice\r\nlaid low by fevers, occasionally in peril from Indian attacks, wild\r\nanimals and poisonous serpents, tormented by insect pests, endangered\r\nby floods, one hundred and nineteen days without meat, ninety-eight days\r\nwithout taking off his clothes, Mr. McGowan returned to America, broken\r\nin health but having faithfully fulfilled the commission intrusted to\r\nhim. The Evening Sun, New York, obtained an interview with him at that\r\ntime, and in its issue of May 2, 1889, gave more than a page to a brief\r\nstory of his interesting adventures, and then commented editorially upon\r\nthem, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A ROMANCE OF SCIENCE\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The narrative given elsewhere in the Evening Sun of the wanderings of\r\nEdison's missionary of science, Mr. Frank McGowan, furnishes a new proof\r\nthat the romances of real life surpass any that the imagination can\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n\"In pursuit of a substance that should meet the requirements of the\r\nEdison incandescent lamp, Mr. McGowan penetrated the wilderness of the\r\nAmazon, and for a year defied its fevers, beasts, reptiles, and deadly\r\ninsects in his quest of a material so precious that jealous Nature has\r\nhidden it in her most secret fastnesses.\r\n\r\n\"No hero of mythology or fable ever dared such dragons to rescue some\r\ncaptive goddess as did this dauntless champion of civilization. Theseus,\r\nor Siegfried, or any knight of the fairy books might envy the victories\r\nof Edison's irresistible lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"As a sample story of adventure, Mr. McGowan's narrative is a marvel fit\r\nto be classed with the historic journeyings of the greatest travellers.\r\nBut it gains immensely in interest when we consider that it succeeded in\r\nits scientific purpose. The mysterious bamboo was discovered, and large\r\nquantities of it were procured and brought to the Wizard's laboratory,\r\nthere to suffer another wondrous change and then to light up our\r\npleasure-haunts and our homes with a gentle radiance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA further, though rather sad, interest attaches to the McGowan story,\r\nfor only a short time had elapsed after his return to America when he\r\ndisappeared suddenly and mysteriously, and in spite of long-continued\r\nand strenuous efforts to obtain some light on the subject, no clew\r\nor trace of him was ever found. He was a favorite among the Edison\r\n\"oldtimers,\" and his memory is still cherished, for when some of the\r\n\"boys\" happen to get together, as they occasionally do, some one is\r\nalmost sure to \"wonder what became of poor 'Mac.'\" He was last seen at\r\nMouquin's famous old French restaurant on Fulton Street, New York, where\r\nhe lunched with one of the authors of this book and the late Luther\r\nStieringer. He sat with them for two or three hours discussing his\r\nwonderful trip, and telling some fascinating stories of adventure. Then\r\nthe party separated at the Ann Street door of the restaurant, after\r\nmaking plans to secure the narrative in more detailed form for\r\nsubsequent use--and McGowan has not been seen from that hour to this.\r\nThe trail of the explorer was more instantly lost in New York than in\r\nthe vast recesses of the Amazon swamps.\r\n\r\nThe next and last explorer whom Edison sent out in search of\r\nnatural fibres was Mr. James Ricalton, of Maplewood, New Jersey, a\r\nschool-principal, a well-known traveller, and an ardent student of\r\nnatural science. Mr. Ricalton's own story of his memorable expedition is\r\nso interesting as to be worthy of repetition here:\r\n\r\n\"A village schoolmaster is not unaccustomed to door-rappings; for the\r\nsteps of belligerent mothers are often thitherward bent seeking redress\r\nfor conjured wrongs to their darling boobies.\r\n\r\n\"It was a bewildering moment, therefore, to the Maplewood teacher when,\r\nin answering a rap at the door one afternoon, he found, instead of an\r\nirate mother, a messenger from the laboratory of the world's greatest\r\ninventor bearing a letter requesting an audience a few hours later.\r\n\r\n\"Being the teacher to whom reference is made, I am now quite willing to\r\nconfess that for the remainder of that afternoon, less than a problem\r\nin Euclid would have been sufficient to disqualify me for the remaining\r\nscholastic duties of the hour. I felt it, of course, to be no small\r\nhonor for a humble teacher to be called to the sanctum of Thomas A.\r\nEdison. The letter, however, gave no intimation of the nature of the\r\nobject for which I had been invited to appear before Mr. Edison....\r\n\r\n\"When I was presented to Mr. Edison his way of setting forth the\r\nmission he had designated for me was characteristic of how a great mind\r\nconceives vast undertakings and commands great things in few words. At\r\nthis time Mr. Edison had discovered that the fibre of a certain bamboo\r\nafforded a very desirable carbon for the electric lamp, and the variety\r\nof bamboo used was a product of Japan. It was his belief that in other\r\nparts of the world other and superior varieties might be found, and to\r\nthat end he had dispatched explorers to bamboo regions in the valleys\r\nof the great South American rivers, where specimens were found of\r\nextraordinary quality; but the locality in which these specimens were\r\nfound was lost in the limitless reaches of those great river-bottoms.\r\nThe great necessity for more durable carbons became a desideratum so\r\nurgent that the tireless inventor decided to commission another explorer\r\nto search the tropical jungles of the Orient.\r\n\r\n\"This brings me then to the first meeting of Edison, when he set forth\r\nsubstantially as follows, as I remember it twenty years ago, the purpose\r\nfor which he had called me from my scholastic duties. With a quizzical\r\ngleam in his eye, he said: 'I want a man to ransack all the tropical\r\njungles of the East to find a better fibre for my lamp; I expect it to\r\nbe found in the palm or bamboo family. How would you like that job?'\r\nSuiting my reply to his love of brevity and dispatch, I said, 'That\r\nwould suit me.' 'Can you go to-morrow?' was his next question. 'Well,\r\nMr. Edison, I must first of all get a leave of absence from my Board of\r\nEducation, and assist the board to secure a substitute for the time of\r\nmy absence. How long will it take, Mr. Edison?' 'How can I tell? Maybe\r\nsix months, and maybe five years; no matter how long, find it.' He\r\ncontinued: 'I sent a man to South America to find what I want; he found\r\nit; but lost the place where he found it, so he might as well never have\r\nfound it at all.' Hereat I was enjoined to proceed forthwith to court\r\nthe Board of Education for a leave of absence, which I did successfully,\r\nthe board considering that a call so important and honorary was entitled\r\nto their unqualified favor, which they generously granted.\r\n\r\n\"I reported to Mr. Edison on the following day, when he instructed me to\r\ncome to the laboratory at once to learn all the details of drawing and\r\ncarbonizing fibres, which it would be necessary to do in the Oriental\r\njungles. This I did, and, in the mean time, a set of suitable tools for\r\nthis purpose had been ordered to be made in the laboratory. As soon as\r\nI learned my new trade, which I accomplished in a few days, Mr. Edison\r\ndirected me to the library of the laboratory to occupy a few days in\r\nstudying the geography of the Orient and, particularly, in drawing maps\r\nof the tributaries of the Ganges, the Irrawaddy, and the Brahmaputra\r\nrivers, and other regions which I expected to explore.\r\n\r\n\"It was while thus engaged that Mr. Edison came to me one day and said:\r\n'If you will go up to the house' (his palatial home not far away) 'and\r\nlook behind the sofa in the library you will find a joint of bamboo, a\r\nspecimen of that found in South America; bring it down and make a study\r\nof it; if you find something equal to that I will be satisfied.' At the\r\nhome I was guided to the library by an Irish servant-woman, to whom I\r\ncommunicated my knowledge of the definite locality of the sample joint.\r\nShe plunged her arm, bare and herculean, behind the aforementioned sofa,\r\nand holding aloft a section of wood, called out in a mood of discovery:\r\n'Is that it?' Replying in the affirmative, she added, under an impulse\r\nof innocent divination that whatever her wizard master laid hands upon\r\ncould result in nothing short of an invention, 'Sure, sor, and what's he\r\ngoing to invint out o' that?'\r\n\r\n\"My kit of tools made, my maps drawn, my Oriental geography reviewed, I\r\ncome to the point when matters of immediate departure are discussed; and\r\nwhen I took occasion to mention to my chief that, on the subject of life\r\ninsurance, underwriters refuse to take any risks on an enterprise so\r\nhazardous, Mr. Edison said that, if I did not place too high a valuation\r\non my person, he would take the risk himself. I replied that I was born\r\nand bred in New York State, but now that I had become a Jersey man I did\r\nnot value myself at above fifteen hundred dollars. Edison laughed and\r\nsaid that he would assume the risk, and another point was settled. The\r\nnext matter was the financing of the trip, about which Mr. Edison asked\r\nin a tentative way about the rates to the East. I told him the expense\r\nof such a trip could not be determined beforehand in detail, but that I\r\nhad established somewhat of a reputation for economic travel, and that\r\nI did not believe any traveller could surpass me in that respect. He\r\ndesired no further assurance in that direction, and thereupon ordered a\r\nletter of credit made out with authorization to order a second when the\r\nfirst was exhausted. Herein then are set forth in briefest space the\r\npreliminaries of a circuit of the globe in quest of fibre.\r\n\r\n\"It so happened that the day on which I set out fell on Washington's\r\nBirthday, and I suggested to my boys and girls at school that they make\r\na line across the station platform near the school at Maplewood,\r\nand from this line I would start eastward around the world, and if\r\ngood-fortune should bring me back I would meet them from the westward at\r\nthe same line. As I had often made them 'toe the scratch,' for once they\r\nwere only too well pleased to have me toe the line for them.\r\n\r\n\"This was done, and I sailed via England and the Suez Canal to Ceylon,\r\nthat fair isle to which Sindbad the Sailor made his sixth voyage,\r\npicturesquely referred to in history as the 'brightest gem in the\r\nBritish Colonial Crown.' I knew Ceylon to be eminently tropical; I knew\r\nit to be rich in many varieties of the bamboo family, which has been\r\ncalled the king of the grasses; and in this family had I most hope of\r\nfinding the desired fibre. Weeks were spent in this paradisiacal isle.\r\nEvery part was visited. Native wood craftsmen were offered a premium on\r\nevery new species brought in, and in this way nearly a hundred species\r\nwere tested, a greater number than was found in any other country. One\r\nof the best specimens tested during the entire trip around the world was\r\nfound first in Ceylon, although later in Burmah, it being indigenous\r\nto the latter country. It is a gigantic tree-grass or reed growing in\r\nclumps of from one to two hundred, often twelve inches in diameter, and\r\none hundred and fifty feet high, and known as the giant bamboo (Bambusa\r\ngigantia). This giant grass stood the highest test as a carbon, and on\r\naccount of its extraordinary size and qualities I extend it this special\r\nmention. With others who have given much attention to this remarkable\r\nreed, I believe that in its manifold uses the bamboo is the world's\r\ngreatest dendral benefactor.\r\n\r\n\"From Ceylon I proceeded to India, touching the great peninsula first\r\nat Cape Comorin, and continuing northward by way of Pondicherry, Madura,\r\nand Madras; and thence to the tableland of Bangalore and the Western\r\nGhauts, testing many kinds of wood at every point, but particularly the\r\npalm and bamboo families. From the range of the Western Ghauts I went to\r\nBombay and then north by the way of Delhi to Simla, the summer capital\r\nof the Himalayas; thence again northward to the headwaters of the Sutlej\r\nRiver, testing everywhere on my way everything likely to afford the\r\ndesired carbon.\r\n\r\n\"On returning from the mountains I followed the valleys of the Jumna\r\nand the Ganges to Calcutta, whence I again ascended the Sub-Himalayas to\r\nDarjeeling, where the numerous river-bottoms were sprinkled plentifully\r\nwith many varieties of bamboo, from the larger sizes to dwarfed species\r\ncovering the mountain slopes, and not longer than the grass of meadows.\r\nAgain descending to the plains I passed eastward to the Brahmaputra\r\nRiver, which I ascended to the foot-hills in Assam; but finding nothing\r\nof superior quality in all this northern region I returned to Calcutta\r\nand sailed thence to Rangoon, in Burmah; and there, finding no samples\r\ngiving more excellent tests in the lower reaches of the Irrawaddy,\r\nI ascended that river to Mandalay, where, through Burmese bamboo\r\nwiseacres, I gathered in from round about and tested all that the\r\nunusually rich Burmese flora could furnish. In Burmah the giant bamboo,\r\nas already mentioned, is found indigenous; but beside it no superior\r\nvarieties were found. Samples tested at several points on the Malay\r\nPeninsula showed no new species, except at a point north of Singapore,\r\nwhere I found a species large and heavy which gave a test nearly equal\r\nto that of the giant bamboo in Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\"After completing the Malay Peninsula I had planned to visit Java and\r\nBorneo; but having found in the Malay Peninsula and in Ceylon a bamboo\r\nfibre which averaged a test from one to two hundred per cent. better\r\nthan that in use at the lamp factory, I decided it was unnecessary to\r\nvisit these countries or New Guinea, as my 'Eureka' had already been\r\nestablished, and that I would therefore set forth over the return\r\nhemisphere, searching China and Japan on the way. The rivers in Southern\r\nChina brought down to Canton bamboos of many species, where this\r\nwondrously utilitarian reed enters very largely into the industrial life\r\nof that people, and not merely into the industrial life, but even into\r\nthe culinary arts, for bamboo sprouts are a universal vegetable\r\nin China; but among all the bamboos of China I found none of\r\nsuperexcellence in carbonizing qualities. Japan came next in the\r\nsuccession of countries to be explored, but there the work was much\r\nsimplified, from the fact that the Tokio Museum contains a complete\r\nclassified collection of all the different species in the empire, and\r\nthere samples could be obtained and tested.\r\n\r\n\"Now the last of the important bamboo-producing countries in the globe\r\ncircuit had been done, and the 'home-lap' was in order; the broad\r\nPacific was spanned in fourteen days; my natal continent in six; and\r\non the 22d of February, on the same day, at the same hour, at the\r\nsame minute, one year to a second, 'little Maude,' a sweet maid of the\r\nschool, led me across the line which completed the circuit of the globe,\r\nand where I was greeted by the cheers of my boys and girls. I at once\r\nreported to Mr. Edison, whose manner of greeting my return was as\r\ncharacteristic of the man as his summary and matter-of-fact manner of my\r\ndispatch. His little catechism of curious inquiry was embraced in four\r\nsmall and intensely Anglo-Saxon words--with his usual pleasant smile he\r\nextended his hand and said: 'Did you get it?' This was surely a summing\r\nof a year's exploration not less laconic than Caesar's review of his\r\nGallic campaign. When I replied that I had, but that he must be the\r\nfinal judge of what I had found, he said that during my absence he\r\nhad succeeded in making an artificial carbon which was meeting the\r\nrequirements satisfactorily; so well, indeed, that I believe no\r\npractical use was ever made of the bamboo fibres thereafter.\r\n\r\n\"I have herein given a very brief resume of my search for fibre through\r\nthe Orient; and during my connection with that mission I was at all\r\ntimes not less astonished at Mr. Edison's quick perception of conditions\r\nand his instant decision and his bigness of conceptions, than I had\r\nalways been with his prodigious industry and his inventive genius.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking persons know that blatant men never accomplish much, and\r\nEdison's marvellous brevity of speech along with his miraculous\r\nachievements should do much to put bores and garrulity out of fashion.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Edison had instituted such a costly and exhaustive search\r\nthroughout the world for the most perfect of natural fibres, he did not\r\nnecessarily feel committed for all time to the exclusive use of that\r\nmaterial for his lamp filaments. While these explorations were in\r\nprogress, as indeed long before, he had given much thought to the\r\nproduction of some artificial compound that would embrace not only the\r\nrequired homogeneity, but also many other qualifications necessary for\r\nthe manufacture of an improved type of lamp which had become desirable\r\nby reason of the rapid adoption of his lighting system.\r\n\r\nAt the very time Mr. McGowan was making his explorations deep in South\r\nAmerica, and Mr. Ricalton his swift trip around the world, Edison,\r\nafter much investigation and experiment, had produced a compound which\r\npromised better results than bamboo fibres. After some changes dictated\r\nby experience, this artificial filament was adopted in the manufacture\r\nof lamps. No radical change was immediately made, however, but the\r\nproduct of the lamp factory was gradually changed over, during the\r\ncourse of a few years, from the use of bamboo to the \"squirted\"\r\nfilament, as the new material was called. An artificial compound of one\r\nkind or another has indeed been universally adopted for the purpose\r\nby all manufacturers; hence the incandescing conductors in all\r\ncarbon-filament lamps of the present day are made in that way. The fact\r\nremains, however, that for nearly nine years all Edison lamps (many\r\nmillions in the aggregate) were made with bamboo filaments, and many of\r\nthem for several years after that, until bamboo was finally abandoned in\r\nthe early nineties, except for use in a few special types which were so\r\nmade until about the end of 1908. The last few years have witnessed\r\na remarkable advance in the manufacture of incandescent lamps in the\r\nsubstitution of metallic filaments for those of carbon. It will be\r\nremembered that many of the earlier experiments were based on the use of\r\nstrips of platinum; while other rare metals were the subject of casual\r\ntrial. No real success was attained in that direction, and for many\r\nyears the carbon-filament lamp reigned supreme. During the last four\r\nor five years lamps with filaments made from tantalum and tungsten have\r\nbeen produced and placed on the market with great success, and are now\r\nlargely used. Their price is still very high, however, as compared with\r\nthat of the carbon lamp, which has been vastly improved in methods of\r\nconstruction, and whose average price of fifteen cents is only one-tenth\r\nof what it was when Edison first brought it out.\r\n\r\nWith the close of Mr. McGowan's and Mr. Ricalton's expeditions, there\r\nended the historic world-hunt for natural fibres. From start to finish\r\nthe investigations and searches made by Edison himself, and carried on\r\nby others under his direction, are remarkable not only from the fact\r\nthat they entailed a total expenditure of about $100,000, (disbursed\r\nunder his supervision by Mr. Upton), but also because of their unique\r\ninception and thoroughness they illustrate one of the strongest traits\r\nof his character--an invincible determination to leave no stone unturned\r\nto acquire that which he believes to be in existence, and which, when\r\nfound, will answer the purpose that he has in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nINVENTING A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF LIGHTING\r\n\r\nIN Berlin, on December 11, 1908, with notable eclat, the seventieth\r\nbirthday was celebrated of Emil Rathenau, the founder of the great\r\nAllgemein Elektricitaets Gesellschaft. This distinguished German,\r\ncreator of a splendid industry, then received the congratulations of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, headed by Emperor William, who spoke enthusiastically\r\nof his services to electro-technics and to Germany. In his interesting\r\nacknowledgment, Mr. Rathenau told how he went to Paris in 1881, and at\r\nthe electrical exhibition there saw the display of Edison's inventions\r\nin electric lighting \"which have met with as little proper appreciation\r\nas his countless innovations in connection with telegraphy, telephony,\r\nand the entire electrical industry.\" He saw the Edison dynamo, and he\r\nsaw the incandescent lamp, \"of which millions have been manufactured\r\nsince that day without the great master being paid the tribute to his\r\ninvention.\" But what impressed the observant, thoroughgoing German was\r\nthe breadth with which the whole lighting art had been elaborated and\r\nperfected, even at that early day. \"The Edison system of lighting was as\r\nbeautifully conceived down to the very details, and as thoroughly worked\r\nout as if it had been tested for decades in various towns. Neither\r\nsockets, switches, fuses, lamp-holders, nor any of the other accessories\r\nnecessary to complete the installation were wanting; and the generating\r\nof the current, the regulation, the wiring with distributing boxes,\r\nhouse connections, meters, etc., all showed signs of astonishing skill\r\nand incomparable genius.\"\r\n\r\nSuch praise on such an occasion from the man who introduced incandescent\r\nelectric lighting into Germany is significant as to the continued\r\nappreciation abroad of Mr. Edison's work. If there is one thing modern\r\nGermany is proud and jealous of, it is her leadership in electrical\r\nengineering and investigation. But with characteristic insight, Mr.\r\nRathenau here placed his finger on the great merit that has often been\r\nforgotten. Edison was not simply the inventor of a new lamp and a\r\nnew dynamo. They were invaluable elements, but far from all that was\r\nnecessary. His was the mighty achievement of conceiving and executing\r\nin all its details an art and an industry absolutely new to the world.\r\nWithin two years this man completed and made that art available in its\r\nessential, fundamental facts, which remain unchanged after thirty years\r\nof rapid improvement and widening application.\r\n\r\nSuch a stupendous feat, whose equal is far to seek anywhere in the\r\nhistory of invention, is worth studying, especially as the task will\r\ntake us over much new ground and over very little of the territory\r\nalready covered. Notwithstanding the enormous amount of thought and\r\nlabor expended on the incandescent lamp problem from the autumn of\r\n1878 to the winter of 1879, it must not be supposed for one moment that\r\nEdison's whole endeavor and entire inventive skill had been given to the\r\nlamp alone, or the dynamo alone. We have sat through the long watches\r\nof the night while Edison brooded on the real solution of the swarming\r\nproblems. We have gazed anxiously at the steady fingers of the deft and\r\ncautious Batchelor, as one fragile filament after another refused to\r\nstay intact until it could be sealed into its crystal prison and there\r\nglow with light that never was before on land or sea. We have calculated\r\narmatures and field coils for the new dynamo with Upton, and held the\r\nstakes for Jehl and his fellows at their winding bees. We have seen the\r\nmineral and vegetable kingdoms rifled and ransacked for substances that\r\nwould yield the best \"filament.\" We have had the vague consciousness of\r\nassisting at a great development whose evidences to-day on every hand\r\nattest its magnitude. We have felt the fierce play of volcanic effort,\r\nlifting new continents of opportunity from the infertile sea, without\r\nany devastation of pre-existing fields of human toil and harvest. But\r\nit still remains to elucidate the actual thing done; to reduce it to\r\nconcrete data, and in reducing, to unfold its colossal dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe lighting system that Edison contemplated in this entirely new\r\ndeparture from antecedent methods included the generation of electrical\r\nenergy, or current, on a very large scale; its distribution throughout\r\nextended areas, and its division and subdivision into small units\r\nconverted into light at innumerable points in every direction from\r\nthe source of supply, each unit to be independent of every other and\r\nsusceptible to immediate control by the user.\r\n\r\nThis was truly an altogether prodigious undertaking. We need not\r\nwonder that Professor Tyndall, in words implying grave doubt as to the\r\npossibility of any solution of the various problems, said publicly that\r\nhe would much rather have the matter in Edison's hands than in his own.\r\nThere were no precedents, nothing upon which to build or improve. The\r\nproblems could only be answered by the creation of new devices and\r\nmethods expressly worked out for their solution. An electric lamp\r\nanswering certain specific requirements would, indeed, be the key to the\r\nsituation, but its commercial adaptation required a multifarious variety\r\nof apparatus and devices. The word \"system\" is much abused in invention,\r\nand during the early days of electric lighting its use applied to a mere\r\nfreakish lamp or dynamo was often ludicrous. But, after all, nothing\r\nshort of a complete system could give real value to the lamp as an\r\ninvention; nothing short of a system could body forth the new art to\r\nthe public. Let us therefore set down briefly a few of the leading items\r\nneeded for perfect illumination by electricity, all of which were part\r\nof the Edison programme:\r\n\r\nFirst--To conceive a broad and fundamentally correct method of\r\ndistributing the current, satisfactory in a scientific sense and\r\npractical commercially in its efficiency and economy. This meant, ready\r\nmade, a comprehensive plan analogous to illumination by gas, with a\r\nnetwork of conductors all connected together, so that in any given city\r\narea the lights could be fed with electricity from several directions,\r\nthus eliminating any interruption due to the disturbance on any\r\nparticular section.\r\n\r\nSecond--To devise an electric lamp that would give about the same amount\r\nof light as a gas jet, which custom had proven to be a suitable and\r\nuseful unit. This lamp must possess the quality of requiring only a\r\nsmall investment in the copper conductors reaching it. Each lamp must\r\nbe independent of every other lamp. Each and all the lights must be\r\nproduced and operated with sufficient economy to compete on a commercial\r\nbasis with gas. The lamp must be durable, capable of being easily and\r\nsafely handled by the public, and one that would remain capable of\r\nburning at full incandescence and candle-power a great length of time.\r\n\r\nThird--To devise means whereby the amount of electrical energy furnished\r\nto each and every customer could be determined, as in the case of gas,\r\nand so that this could be done cheaply and reliably by a meter at the\r\ncustomer's premises.\r\n\r\nFourth--To elaborate a system or network of conductors capable of being\r\nplaced underground or overhead, which would allow of being tapped at any\r\nintervals, so that service wires could be run from the main conductors\r\nin the street into each building. Where these mains went below\r\nthe surface of the thoroughfare, as in large cities, there must be\r\nprotective conduit or pipe for the copper conductors, and these pipes\r\nmust allow of being tapped wherever necessary. With these conductors and\r\npipes must also be furnished manholes, junction-boxes, connections, and\r\na host of varied paraphernalia insuring perfect general distribution.\r\n\r\nFifth--To devise means for maintaining at all points in an extended area\r\nof distribution a practically even pressure of current, so that all\r\nthe lamps, wherever located, near or far away from the central station,\r\nshould give an equal light at all times, independent of the number that\r\nmight be turned on; and safeguarding the lamps against rupture by sudden\r\nand violent fluctuations of current. There must also be means for thus\r\nregulating at the point where the current was generated the quality or\r\npressure of the current throughout the whole lighting area, with devices\r\nfor indicating what such pressure might actually be at various points in\r\nthe area.\r\n\r\nSixth--To design efficient dynamos, such not being in existence at the\r\ntime, that would convert economically the steam-power of high-speed\r\nengines into electrical energy, together with means for connecting and\r\ndisconnecting them with the exterior consumption circuits; means for\r\nregulating, equalizing their loads, and adjusting the number of dynamos\r\nto be used according to the fluctuating demands on the central station.\r\nAlso the arrangement of complete stations with steam and electric\r\napparatus and auxiliary devices for insuring their efficient and\r\ncontinuous operation.\r\n\r\nSeventh--To invent devices that would prevent the current from becoming\r\nexcessive upon any conductors, causing fire or other injury; also\r\nswitches for turning the current on and off; lamp-holders, fixtures, and\r\nthe like; also means and methods for establishing the interior circuits\r\nthat were to carry current to chandeliers and fixtures in buildings.\r\n\r\nHere was the outline of the programme laid down in the autumn of 1878,\r\nand pursued through all its difficulties to definite accomplishment in\r\nabout eighteen months, some of the steps being made immediately, others\r\nbeing taken as the art evolved. It is not to be imagined for one moment\r\nthat Edison performed all the experiments with his own hands. The method\r\nof working at Menlo Park has already been described in these pages\r\nby those who participated. It would not only have been physically\r\nimpossible for one man to have done all this work himself, in view of\r\nthe time and labor required, and the endless detail; but most of the\r\napparatus and devices invented or suggested by him as the art took shape\r\nrequired the handiwork of skilled mechanics and artisans of a high order\r\nof ability. Toward the end of 1879 the laboratory force thus numbered at\r\nleast one hundred earnest men. In this respect of collaboration, Edison\r\nhas always adopted a policy that must in part be taken to explain his\r\nmany successes. Some inventors of the greatest ability, dealing with\r\nideas and conceptions of importance, have found it impossible to\r\norganize or even to tolerate a staff of co-workers, preferring solitary\r\nand secret toil, incapable of team work, or jealous of any intrusion\r\nthat could possibly bar them from a full and complete claim to the\r\nresult when obtained. Edison always stood shoulder to shoulder with his\r\nassociates, but no one ever questioned the leadership, nor was it ever\r\nin doubt where the inspiration originated. The real truth is that Edison\r\nhas always been so ceaselessly fertile of ideas himself, he has had more\r\nthan his whole staff could ever do to try them all out; he has sought\r\nco-operation, but no exterior suggestion. As a matter of fact a great\r\nmany of the \"Edison men\" have made notable inventions of their own, with\r\nwhich their names are imperishably associated; but while they were with\r\nEdison it was with his work that they were and must be busied.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period of \"inventing a system\" that so much\r\nsystematic and continuous work with good results was done by Edison in\r\nthe design and perfection of dynamos. The value of his contributions\r\nto the art of lighting comprised in this work has never been fully\r\nunderstood or appreciated, having been so greatly overshadowed by\r\nhis invention of the incandescent lamp, and of a complete system of\r\ndistribution. It is a fact, however, that the principal improvements he\r\nmade in dynamo-electric generators were of a radical nature and remain\r\nin the art. Thirty years bring about great changes, especially in a\r\nfield so notably progressive as that of the generation of electricity;\r\nbut different as are the dynamos of to-day from those of the earlier\r\nperiod, they embody essential principles and elements that Edison then\r\nmarked out and elaborated as the conditions of success. There was indeed\r\nprompt appreciation in some well-informed quarters of what Edison was\r\ndoing, evidenced by the sensation caused in the summer of 1881, when\r\nhe designed, built, and shipped to Paris for the first Electrical\r\nExposition ever held, the largest dynamo that had been built up to that\r\ntime. It was capable of lighting twelve hundred incandescent lamps, and\r\nweighed with its engine twenty-seven tons, the armature alone weighing\r\nsix tons. It was then, and for a long time after, the eighth wonder of\r\nthe scientific world, and its arrival and installation in Paris were\r\neagerly watched by the most famous physicists and electricians of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nEdison's amusing description of his experience in shipping the dynamo to\r\nParis when built may appropriately be given here: \"I built a very large\r\ndynamo with the engine directly connected, which I intended for the\r\nParis Exposition of 1881. It was one or two sizes larger than those I\r\nhad previously built. I had only a very short period in which to get it\r\nready and put it on a steamer to reach the Exposition in time. After the\r\nmachine was completed we found the voltage was too low. I had to devise\r\na way of raising the voltage without changing the machine, which I did\r\nby adding extra magnets. After this was done, we tested the machine, and\r\nthe crank-shaft of the engine broke and flew clear across the shop.\r\nBy working night and day a new crank-shaft was put in, and we only had\r\nthree days left from that time to get it on board the steamer; and had\r\nalso to run a test. So we made arrangements with the Tammany leader, and\r\nthrough him with the police, to clear the street--one of the New York\r\ncrosstown streets--and line it with policemen, as we proposed to make a\r\nquick passage, and didn't know how much time it would take. About four\r\nhours before the steamer had to get it, the machine was shut down after\r\nthe test, and a schedule was made out in advance of what each man had\r\nto do. Sixty men were put on top of the dynamo to get it ready, and each\r\nman had written orders as to what he was to perform. We got it all taken\r\napart and put on trucks and started off. They drove the horses with a\r\nfire-bell in front of them to the French pier, the policemen lining\r\nthe streets. Fifty men were ready to help the stevedores get it on the\r\nsteamer--and we were one hour ahead of time.\"\r\n\r\nThis Exposition brings us, indeed, to a dramatic and rather pathetic\r\nparting of the ways. The hour had come for the old laboratory force that\r\nhad done such brilliant and memorable work to disband, never again to\r\nassemble under like conditions for like effort, although its members all\r\nremained active in the field, and many have ever since been associated\r\nprominently with some department of electrical enterprise. The fact\r\nwas they had done their work so well they must now disperse to show\r\nthe world what it was, and assist in its industrial exploitation. In\r\nreality, they were too few for the demands that reached Edison from\r\nall parts of the world for the introduction of his system; and in the\r\nemergency the men nearest to him and most trusted were those upon whom\r\nhe could best depend for such missionary work as was now required.\r\nThe disciples full of fire and enthusiasm, as well as of knowledge and\r\nexperience, were soon scattered to the four winds, and the rapidity\r\nwith which the Edison system was everywhere successfully introduced is\r\ntestimony to the good judgment with which their leader had originally\r\nselected them as his colleagues. No one can say exactly just how this\r\nprocess of disintegration began, but Mr. E. H. Johnson had already been\r\nsent to England in the Edison interests, and now the question arose as\r\nto what should be done with the French demands and the Paris Electrical\r\nExposition, whose importance as a point of new departure in electrical\r\nindustry was speedily recognized on both sides of the Atlantic. It is\r\nvery interesting to note that as the earlier staff broke up, Edison\r\nbecame the centre of another large body, equally devoted, but more\r\nparticularly concerned with the commercial development of his ideas. Mr.\r\nE. G. Acheson mentions in his personal notes on work at the laboratory,\r\nthat in December of 1880, while on some experimental work, he was called\r\nto the new lamp factory started recently at Menlo Park, and there\r\nfound Edison, Johnson, Batchelor, and Upton in conference, and \"Edison\r\ninformed me that Mr. Batchelor, who was in charge of the construction,\r\ndevelopment, and operation of the lamp factory, was soon to sail\r\nfor Europe to prepare for the exhibit to be made at the Electrical\r\nExposition to be held in Paris during the coming summer.\" These\r\npreparations overlap the reinforcement of the staff with some notable\r\nadditions, chief among them being Mr. Samuel Insull, whose interesting\r\nnarrative of events fits admirably into the story at this stage, and\r\ngives a vivid idea of the intense activity and excitement with which the\r\nwhole atmosphere around Edison was then surcharged: \"I first met Edison\r\non March 1, 1881. I arrived in New York on the City of Chester about\r\nfive or six in the evening, and went direct to 65 Fifth Avenue. I had\r\ncome over to act as Edison's private secretary, the position having been\r\nobtained for me through the good offices of Mr. E. H. Johnson, whom I\r\nhad known in London, and who wrote to Mr. U. H. Painter, of Washington,\r\nabout me in the fall of 1880. Mr. Painter sent the letter on to Mr.\r\nBatchelor, who turned it over to Edison. Johnson returned to America\r\nlate in the fall of 1880, and in January, 1881, cabled to me to come\r\nto this country. At the time he cabled for me Edison was still at Menlo\r\nPark, but when I arrived in New York the famous offices of the Edison\r\nElectric Light Company had been opened at '65' Fifth Avenue, and Edison\r\nhad moved into New York with the idea of assisting in the exploitation\r\nof the Light Company's business.\r\n\r\n\"I was taken by Johnson direct from the Inman Steamship pier to 65 Fifth\r\nAvenue, and met Edison for the first time. There were three rooms on\r\nthe ground floor at that time. The front one was used as a kind of\r\nreception-room; the room immediately behind it was used as the office of\r\nthe president of the Edison Electric Light Company, Major S. B. Eaton.\r\nThe rear room, which was directly back of the front entrance hall, was\r\nEdison's office, and there I first saw him. There was very little in\r\nthe room except a couple of walnut roller-top desks--which were very\r\ngenerally used in American offices at that time. Edison received me with\r\ngreat cordiality. I think he was possibly disappointed at my being so\r\nyoung a man; I had only just turned twenty-one, and had a very boyish\r\nappearance. The picture of Edison is as vivid to me now as if the\r\nincident occurred yesterday, although it is now more than twenty-nine\r\nyears since that first meeting. I had been connected with Edison's\r\naffairs in England as private secretary to his London agent for about\r\ntwo years; and had been taught by Johnson to look on Edison as the\r\ngreatest electrical inventor of the day--a view of him, by-the-way,\r\nwhich has been greatly strengthened as the years have rolled by. Owing\r\nto this, and to the fact that I felt highly flattered at the appointment\r\nas his private secretary, I was naturally prepared to accept him as a\r\nhero. With my strict English ideas as to the class of clothes to be worn\r\nby a prominent man, there was nothing in Edison's dress to impress me.\r\nHe wore a rather seedy black diagonal Prince Albert coat and waistcoat,\r\nwith trousers of a dark material, and a white silk handkerchief around\r\nhis neck, tied in a careless knot falling over the stiff bosom of a\r\nwhite shirt somewhat the worse for wear. He had a large wide-awake\r\nhat of the sombrero pattern then generally used in this country, and a\r\nrough, brown overcoat, cut somewhat similarly to his Prince Albert\r\ncoat. His hair was worn quite long, and hanging carelessly over his fine\r\nforehead. His face was at that time, as it is now, clean shaven. He was\r\nfull in face and figure, although by no means as stout as he has grown\r\nin recent years. What struck me above everything else was the wonderful\r\nintelligence and magnetism of his expression, and the extreme brightness\r\nof his eyes. He was far more modest than in my youthful picture of him.\r\nI had expected to find a man of distinction. His appearance, as a whole,\r\nwas not what you would call 'slovenly,' it is best expressed by the word\r\n'careless.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Insull supplements this pen-picture by another, bearing upon the\r\nhustle and bustle of the moment: \"After a short conversation Johnson\r\nhurried me off to meet his family, and later in the evening, about\r\neight o'clock, he and I returned to Edison's office; and I found myself\r\nlaunched without further ceremony into Edison's business affairs.\r\nJohnson had already explained to me that he was sailing the next\r\nmorning, March 2d, on the S.S. Arizona, and that Mr. Edison wanted to\r\nspend the evening discussing matters in connection with his European\r\naffairs. It was assumed, inasmuch as I had just arrived from London,\r\nthat I would be able to give more or less information on this subject.\r\nAs Johnson was to sail the next morning at five o'clock, Edison\r\nexplained that it would be necessary for him to have an understanding\r\nof European matters. Edison started out by drawing from his desk a\r\ncheck-book and stating how much money he had in the bank; and he wanted\r\nto know what European telephone securities were most salable, as\r\nhe wished to raise the necessary funds to put on their feet the\r\nincandescent lamp factory, the Electric Tube works, and the necessary\r\nshops to build dynamos. All through the interview I was tremendously\r\nimpressed with Edison's wonderful resourcefulness and grasp, and his\r\nimmediate appreciation of any suggestion of consequence bearing on the\r\nsubject under discussion.\r\n\r\n\"He spoke with very great enthusiasm of the work before him--namely, the\r\ndevelopment of his electric-lighting system; and his one idea seemed to\r\nbe to raise all the money he could with the object of pouring it\r\ninto the manufacturing side of the lighting business. I remember how\r\nextraordinarily I was impressed with him on this account, as I had\r\njust come from a circle of people in London who not only questioned the\r\npossibility of the success of Edison's invention, but often expressed\r\ndoubt as to whether the work he had done could be called an invention at\r\nall. After discussing affairs with Johnson--who was receiving his final\r\ninstructions from Edison--far into the night, and going down to the\r\nsteamer to see Johnson aboard, I finished my first night's business\r\nwith Edison somewhere between four and five in the morning, feeling\r\nthoroughly imbued with the idea that I had met one of the great master\r\nminds of the world. You must allow for my youthful enthusiasm, but you\r\nmust also bear in mind Edison's peculiar gift of magnetism, which has\r\nenabled him during his career to attach so many men to him. I fell a\r\nvictim to the spell at the first interview.\"\r\n\r\nEvents moved rapidly in those days. The next morning, Tuesday, Edison\r\ntook his new fidus Achates with him to a conference with John Roach, the\r\nfamous old ship-builder, and at it agreed to take the AEtna Iron works,\r\nwhere Roach had laid the foundations of his fame and fortune. These\r\nworks were not in use at the time. They were situated on Goerck Street,\r\nNew York, north of Grand Street, on the east side of the city,\r\nand there, very soon after, was established the first Edison\r\ndynamo-manufacturing establishment, known for many years as the Edison\r\nMachine Works. The same night Insull made his first visit to Menlo Park.\r\nUp to that time he had seen very little incandescent lighting, for the\r\nsimple reason that there was very little to see. Johnson had had a\r\nfew Edison lamps in London, lit up from primary batteries, as a\r\ndemonstration; and in the summer of 1880 Swan had had a few series\r\nlamps burning in London. In New York a small gas-engine plant was being\r\nstarted at the Edison offices on Fifth Avenue. But out at Menlo Park\r\nthere was the first actual electric-lighting central station, supplying\r\ndistributed incandescent lamps and some electric motors by means of\r\nunderground conductors imbedded in asphaltum and surrounded by a wooden\r\nbox. Mr. Insull says: \"The system employed was naturally the two-wire,\r\nas at that time the three-wire had not been thought of. The lamps\r\nwere partly of the horseshoe filament paper-carbon type, and partly\r\nbamboo-filament lamps, and were of an efficiency of 95 to 100 watts per\r\n16 c.p. I can never forget the impression that this first view of the\r\nelectric-lighting industry produced on me. Menlo Park must always be\r\nlooked upon as the birthplace of the electric light and power industry.\r\nAt that time it was the only place where could be seen an electric\r\nlight and power multiple arc distribution system, the operation of which\r\nseemed as successful to my youthful mind as the operation of one of the\r\nlarge metropolitan systems to-day. I well remember about ten o'clock\r\nthat night going down to the Menlo Park depot and getting the station\r\nagent, who was also the telegraph operator, to send some cable messages\r\nfor me to my London friends, announcing that I had seen Edison's\r\nincandescent lighting system in actual operation, and that so far as I\r\ncould tell it was an accomplished fact. A few weeks afterward I received\r\na letter from one of my London friends, who was a doubting Thomas,\r\nupbraiding me for coming so soon under the spell of the 'Yankee\r\ninventor.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was to confront and deal with just this element of doubt in London\r\nand in Europe generally, that the dispatch of Johnson to England and of\r\nBatchelor to France was intended. Throughout the Edison staff there\r\nwas a mingled feeling of pride in the work, resentment at the doubts\r\nexpressed about it, and keen desire to show how excellent it was.\r\nBatchelor left for Paris in July, 1881--on his second trip to Europe\r\nthat year--and the exhibit was made which brought such an instantaneous\r\nrecognition of the incalculable value of Edison's lighting inventions,\r\nas evidenced by the awards and rewards immediately bestowed upon him. He\r\nwas made an officer of the Legion of Honor, and Prof. George F. Barker\r\ncabled as follows from Paris, announcing the decision of the expert jury\r\nwhich passed upon the exhibits: \"Accept my congratulations. You have\r\ndistanced all competitors and obtained a diploma of honor, the highest\r\naward given in the Exposition. No person in any class in which you were\r\nan exhibitor received a like reward.\"\r\n\r\nNor was this all. Eminent men in science who had previously expressed\r\ntheir disbelief in the statements made as to the Edison system were now\r\nforemost in generous praise of his notable achievements, and accorded\r\nhim full credit for its completion. A typical instance was M. Du Moncel,\r\na distinguished electrician, who had written cynically about Edison's\r\nwork and denied its practicability. He now recanted publicly in this\r\nlanguage, which in itself shows the state of the art when Edison came\r\nto the front: \"All these experiments achieved but moderate success, and\r\nwhen, in 1879, the new Edison incandescent carbon lamp was announced,\r\nmany of the scientists, and I, particularly, doubted the accuracy of\r\nthe reports which came from America. This horseshoe of carbonized\r\npaper seemed incapable to resist mechanical shocks and to maintain\r\nincandescence for any considerable length of time. Nevertheless, Mr.\r\nEdison was not discouraged, and despite the active opposition made to\r\nhis lamp, despite the polemic acerbity of which he was the object, he\r\ndid not cease to perfect it; and he succeeded in producing the lamps\r\nwhich we now behold exhibited at the Exposition, and are admired by all\r\nfor their perfect steadiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe competitive lamps exhibited and tested at this time comprised those\r\nof Edison, Maxim, Swan, and Lane-Fox. The demonstration of Edison's\r\nsuccess stimulated the faith of his French supporters, and rendered\r\neasier the completion of plans for the Societe Edison Continental, of\r\nParis, formed to operate the Edison patents on the Continent of Europe.\r\nMr. Batchelor, with Messrs. Acheson and Hipple, and one or two other\r\nassistants, at the close of the Exposition transferred their energies\r\nto the construction and equipment of machine-shops and lamp factories\r\nat Ivry-sur-Seine for the company, and in a very short time the\r\ninstallation of plants began in various countries--France, Italy,\r\nHolland, Belgium, etc.\r\n\r\nAll through 1881 Johnson was very busy, for his part, in England. The\r\nfirst \"Jumbo\" Edison dynamo had gone to Paris; the second and third\r\nwent to London, where they were installed in 1881 by Mr. Johnson and his\r\nassistant, Mr. W. J. Hammer, in the three-thousand-light central station\r\non Holborn Viaduct, the plant going into operation on January 12,\r\n1882. Outside of Menlo Park this was the first regular station for\r\nincandescent lighting in the world, as the Pearl Street station in New\r\nYork did not go into operation until September of the same year. This\r\nhistoric plant was hurriedly thrown together on Crown land, and would\r\ndoubtless have been the nucleus of a great system but for the passage of\r\nthe English electric lighting act of 1882, which at once throttled the\r\nindustry by its absurd restrictive provisions, and which, though\r\ngreatly modified, has left England ever since in a condition of serious\r\ninferiority as to development in electric light and power. The streets\r\nand bridges of Holborn Viaduct were lighted by lamps turned on and\r\noff from the station, as well as the famous City Temple of Dr. Joseph\r\nParker, the first church in the world to be lighted by incandescent\r\nlamps--indeed, so far as can be ascertained, the first church to be\r\nilluminated by electricity in any form. Mr. W. J. Hammer, who supplies\r\nsome very interesting notes on the installation, says: \"I well remember\r\nthe astonishment of Doctor Parker and his associates when they noted the\r\ndifference of temperature as compared with gas. I was informed that the\r\npeople would not go in the gallery in warm weather, owing to the great\r\nheat caused by the many gas jets, whereas on the introduction of the\r\nincandescent lamp there was no complaint.\" The telegraph operating-room\r\nof the General Post-Office, at St. Martin's-Le Grand and Newgate Street\r\nnearby, was supplied with four hundred lamps through the instrumentality\r\nof Mr. (Sir) W. H. Preece, who, having been seriously sceptical as to\r\nMr. Edison's results, became one of his most ardent advocates, and did\r\nmuch to facilitate the introduction of the light. This station supplied\r\nits customers by a network of feeders and mains of the standard\r\nunderground two-wire Edison tubing-conductors in sections of iron\r\npipe--such as was used subsequently in New York, Milan, and other\r\ncities. It also had a measuring system for the current, employing the\r\nEdison electrolytic meter. Arc lamps were operated from its circuits,\r\nand one of the first sets of practicable storage batteries was used\r\nexperimentally at the station. In connection with these batteries\r\nMr. Hammer tells a characteristic anecdote of Edison: \"A careless boy\r\npassing through the station whistling a tune and swinging carelessly a\r\nhammer in his hand, rapped a carboy of sulphuric acid which happened to\r\nbe on the floor above a 'Jumbo' dynamo. The blow broke the glass carboy,\r\nand the acid ran down upon the field magnets of the dynamo, destroying\r\nthe windings of one of the twelve magnets. This accident happened while\r\nI was taking a vacation in Germany, and a prominent scientific man\r\nconnected with the company cabled Mr. Edison to know whether the machine\r\nwould work if the coil was cut out. Mr. Edison sent the laconic reply:\r\n'Why doesn't he try it and see?' Mr. E. H. Johnson was kept busy not\r\nonly with the cares and responsibilities of this pioneer English\r\nplant, but by negotiations as to company formations, hearings before\r\nParliamentary committees, and particularly by distinguished visitors,\r\nincluding all the foremost scientific men in England, and a great\r\nmany well-known members of the peerage. Edison was fortunate in being\r\nrepresented by a man with so much address, intimate knowledge of the\r\nsubject, and powers of explanation. As one of the leading English papers\r\nsaid at the time, with equal humor and truth: 'There is but one Edison,\r\nand Johnson is his prophet.'\"\r\n\r\nAs the plant continued in operation, various details and ideas of\r\nimprovement emerged, and Mr. Hammer says: \"Up to the time of the\r\nconstruction of this plant it had been customary to place a single-pole\r\nswitch on one wire and a safety fuse on the other; and the practice of\r\nputting fuses on both sides of a lighting circuit was first used here.\r\nSome of the first, if not the very first, of the insulated fixtures were\r\nused in this plant, and many of the fixtures were equipped with ball\r\ninsulating joints, enabling the chandeliers--or 'electroliers'--to be\r\nturned around, as was common with the gas chandeliers. This particular\r\ndevice was invented by Mr. John B. Verity, whose firm built many of\r\nthe fixtures for the Edison Company, and constructed the notable\r\nelectroliers shown at the Crystal Palace Exposition of 1882.\"\r\n\r\nWe have made a swift survey of developments from the time when the\r\nsystem of lighting was ready for use, and when the staff scattered to\r\nintroduce it. It will be readily understood that Edison did not sit\r\nwith folded hands or drop into complacent satisfaction the moment he\r\nhad reached the practical stage of commercial exploitation. He was not\r\nwilling to say \"Let us rest and be thankful,\" as was one of England's\r\ngreat Liberal leaders after a long period of reform. On the contrary, he\r\nwas never more active than immediately after the work we have summed\r\nup at the beginning of this chapter. While he had been pursuing his\r\ninvestigations of the generator in conjunction with the experiments\r\non the incandescent lamp, he gave much thought to the question of\r\ndistribution of the current over large areas, revolving in his mind\r\nvarious plans for the accomplishment of this purpose, and keeping his\r\nmathematicians very busy working on the various schemes that suggested\r\nthemselves from time to time. The idea of a complete system had been in\r\nhis mind in broad outline for a long time, but did not crystallize into\r\ncommercial form until the incandescent lamp was an accomplished fact.\r\nThus in January, 1880, his first patent application for a \"System of\r\nElectrical Distribution\" was signed. It was filed in the Patent Office a\r\nfew days later, but was not issued as a patent until August 30, 1887. It\r\ncovered, fundamentally, multiple arc distribution, how broadly will\r\nbe understood from the following extracts from the New York Electrical\r\nReview of September 10, 1887: \"It would appear as if the entire field\r\nof multiple distribution were now in the hands of the owners of this\r\npatent.... The patent is about as broad as a patent can be, being\r\nregardless of specific devices, and laying a powerful grasp on the\r\nfundamental idea of multiple distribution from a number of generators\r\nthroughout a metallic circuit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edison made a number of other applications for patents on electrical\r\ndistribution during the year 1880. Among these was the one covering the\r\ncelebrated \"Feeder\" invention, which has been of very great commercial\r\nimportance in the art, its object being to obviate the \"drop\" in\r\npressure, rendering lights dim in those portions of an electric-light\r\nsystem that were remote from the central station. [10]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 10: For further explanation of \"Feeder\" patent,\r\n     see Appendix.]\r\n\r\nFrom these two patents alone, which were absolutely basic and\r\nfundamental in effect, and both of which were, and still are, put into\r\nactual use wherever central-station lighting is practiced, the reader\r\nwill see that Mr. Edison's patient and thorough study, aided by his keen\r\nforesight and unerring judgment, had enabled him to grasp in advance\r\nwith a master hand the chief and underlying principles of a true\r\nsystem--that system which has since been put into practical use all over\r\nthe world, and whose elements do not need the touch or change of more\r\nmodern scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nThese patents were not by any means all that he applied for in the\r\nyear 1880, which it will be remembered was the year in which he was\r\nperfecting the incandescent electric lamp and methods, to put into the\r\nmarket for competition with gas. It was an extraordinarily busy year for\r\nMr. Edison and his whole force, which from time to time was increased\r\nin number. Improvement upon improvement was the order of the day. That\r\nwhich was considered good to-day was superseded by something better and\r\nmore serviceable to-morrow. Device after device, relating to some\r\npart of the entire system, was designed, built, and tried, only to\r\nbe rejected ruthlessly as being unsuitable; but the pursuit was not\r\nabandoned. It was renewed over and over again in innumerable ways until\r\nsuccess had been attained.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1880 Edison had made application for sixty patents, of\r\nwhich thirty-two were in relation to incandescent lamps; seven covered\r\ninventions relating to distributing systems (including the two above\r\nparticularized); five had reference to inventions of parts, such\r\nas motors, sockets, etc.; six covered inventions relating to\r\ndynamo-electric machines; three related to electric railways, and seven\r\nto miscellaneous apparatus, such as telegraph relays, magnetic ore\r\nseparators, magneto signalling apparatus, etc.\r\n\r\nThe list of Mr. Edison's patents (see Appendices) is not only a monument\r\nto his life's work, but serves to show what subjects he has worked on\r\nfrom year to year since 1868. The reader will see from an examination\r\nof this list that the years 1880, 1881, 1882, and 1883 were the most\r\nprolific periods of invention. It is worth while to scrutinize this list\r\nclosely to appreciate the wide range of his activities. Not that his\r\npatents cover his entire range of work by any means, for his note-books\r\nreveal a great number of major and minor inventions for which he has\r\nnot seen fit to take out patents. Moreover, at the period now described\r\nEdison was the victim of a dishonest patent solicitor, who deprived him\r\nof a number of patents in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Around 1881-82 I had several solicitors attending to different classes\r\nof work. One of these did me a most serious injury. It was during\r\nthe time that I was developing my electric-lighting system, and I was\r\nworking and thinking very hard in order to cover all the numerous parts,\r\nin order that it would be complete in every detail. I filed a great many\r\napplications for patents at that time, but there were seventy-eight of\r\nthe inventions I made in that period that were entirely lost to me\r\nand my company by reason of the dishonesty of this patent solicitor.\r\nSpecifications had been drawn, and I had signed and sworn to the\r\napplication for patents for these seventy-eight inventions, and\r\nnaturally I supposed they had been filed in the regular way.\r\n\r\n\"As time passed I was looking for some action of the Patent Office, as\r\nusual, but none came. I thought it very strange, but had no suspicions\r\nuntil I began to see my inventions recorded in the Patent Office Gazette\r\nas being patented by others. Of course I ordered an investigation, and\r\nfound that the patent solicitor had drawn from the company the fees for\r\nfiling all these applications, but had never filed them. All the papers\r\nhad disappeared, however, and what he had evidently done was to sell\r\nthem to others, who had signed new applications and proceeded to take\r\nout patents themselves on my inventions. I afterward found that he\r\nhad been previously mixed up with a somewhat similar crooked job in\r\nconnection with telephone patents.\r\n\r\n\"I am free to confess that the loss of these seventy-eight inventions\r\nhas left a sore spot in me that has never healed. They were important,\r\nuseful, and valuable, and represented a whole lot of tremendous work\r\nand mental effort, and I had had a feeling of pride in having overcome\r\nthrough them a great many serious obstacles, One of these inventions\r\ncovered the multipolar dynamo. It was an elaborated form of the type\r\ncovered by my patent No. 219,393 which had a ring armature. I modified\r\nand improved on this form and had a number of pole pieces placed all\r\naround the ring, with a modified form of armature winding. I built\r\none of these machines and ran it successfully in our early days at the\r\nGoerck Street shop.\r\n\r\n\"It is of no practical use to mention the man's name. I believe he is\r\ndead, but he may have left a family. The occurrence is a matter of the\r\nold Edison Company's records.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from an examination of the list of patents in the\r\nAppendix that Mr. Edison has continued year after year adding to\r\nhis contributions to the art of electric lighting, and in the last\r\ntwenty-eight years--1880-1908--has taken out no fewer than three hundred\r\nand seventy-five patents in this branch of industry alone. These patents\r\nmay be roughly tabulated as follows:\r\n\r\n  Incandescent lamps and their manufacture....................149\r\n  Distributing systems and their control and regulation....... 77\r\n  Dynamo-electric machines and accessories....................106\r\n  Minor parts, such as sockets, switches, safety catches,\r\n  meters, underground conductors and parts, etc............... 43\r\n\r\nQuite naturally most of these patents cover inventions that are in\r\nthe nature of improvements or based upon devices which he had already\r\ncreated; but there are a number that relate to inventions absolutely\r\nfundamental and original in their nature. Some of these have already\r\nbeen alluded to; but among the others there is one which is worthy\r\nof special mention in connection with the present consideration of a\r\ncomplete system. This is patent No. 274,290, applied for November 27,\r\n1882, and is known as the \"Three-wire\" patent. It is described more\r\nfully in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the \"Feeder\" and \"Three-wire\" inventions will be\r\napparent when it is realized that without them it is a question whether\r\nelectric light could be sold to compete with low-priced gas, on account\r\nof the large investment in conductors that would be necessary. If a\r\nlarge city area were to be lighted from a central station by means\r\nof copper conductors running directly therefrom to all parts of the\r\ndistrict, it would be necessary to install large conductors, or suffer\r\nsuch a drop of pressure at the ends most remote from the station as\r\nto cause the lights there to burn with a noticeable diminution of\r\ncandle-power. The Feeder invention overcame this trouble, and made it\r\npossible to use conductors ONLY ONE-EIGHTH THE SIZE that would otherwise\r\nhave been necessary to produce the same results.\r\n\r\nA still further economy in cost of conductors was effected by the\r\n\"Three-wire\" invention, by the use of which the already diminished\r\nconductors could be still further reduced TO ONE-THIRD of this smaller\r\nsize, and at the same time allow of the successful operation of the\r\nstation with far better results than if it were operated exactly as at\r\nfirst conceived. The Feeder and Three-wire systems are at this day used\r\nin all parts of the world, not only in central-station work, but in the\r\ninstallation and operation of isolated electric-light plants in\r\nlarge buildings. No sensible or efficient station manager or electric\r\ncontractor would ever think of an installation made upon any other plan.\r\nThus Mr. Edison's early conceptions of the necessities of a complete\r\nsystem, one of them made even in advance of practice, have stood firm,\r\nunimproved, and unchanged during the past twenty-eight years, a period\r\nof time which has witnessed more wonderful and rapid progress in\r\nelectrical science and art than has been known during any similar art or\r\nperiod of time since the world began.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the complete system in all its parts is not\r\ncomprised in the few of Mr. Edison's patents, of which specific mention\r\nis here made. In order to comprehend the magnitude and extent of his\r\nwork and the quality of his genius, it is necessary to examine minutely\r\nthe list of patents issued for the various elements which go to make up\r\nsuch a system. To attempt any relation in detail of the conception and\r\nworking-out of each part or element; to enter into any description of\r\nthe almost innumerable experiments and investigations that were\r\nmade would entail the writing of several volumes, for Mr. Edison's\r\nclose-written note-books covering these subjects number nearly two\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that enough evidence has been given in this chapter\r\nto lead to an appreciation of the assiduous work and practical skill\r\ninvolved in \"inventing a system\" of lighting that would surpass, and to\r\na great extent, in one single quarter of a century, supersede all the\r\nother methods of illumination developed during long centuries. But it\r\nwill be appropriate before passing on to note that on January 17, 1908,\r\nwhile this biography was being written, Mr. Edison became the fourth\r\nrecipient of the John Fritz gold medal for achievement in industrial\r\nprogress. This medal was founded in 1902 by the professional friends\r\nand associates of the veteran American ironmaster and metallurgical\r\ninventor, in honor of his eightieth birthday. Awards are made by a board\r\nof sixteen engineers appointed in equal numbers from the four great\r\nnational engineering societies--the American Society of Civil\r\nEngineers, the American Institute of Mining Engineers, the American\r\nSociety of Mechanical Engineers, and the American Institute of\r\nElectrical Engineers, whose membership embraces the very pick and flower\r\nof professional engineering talent in America. Up to the time of the\r\nEdison award, three others had been made. The first was to Lord Kelvin,\r\nthe Nestor of physics in Europe, for his work in submarine-cable\r\ntelegraphy and other scientific achievement. The second was to George\r\nWestinghouse for the air-brake. The third was to Alexander Graham Bell\r\nfor the invention and introduction of the telephone. The award to Edison\r\nwas not only for his inventions in duplex and quadruplex telegraphy, and\r\nfor the phonograph, but for the development of a commercially practical\r\nincandescent lamp, and the development of a complete system of electric\r\nlighting, including dynamos, regulating devices, underground system,\r\nprotective devices, and meters. Great as has been the genius brought\r\nto bear on electrical development, there is no other man to whom such a\r\ncomprehensive tribute could be paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT\r\n\r\nIN the previous chapter on the invention of a system, the narrative has\r\nbeen carried along for several years of activity up to the verge of the\r\nsuccessful and commercial application of Edison's ideas and devices\r\nfor incandescent electric lighting. The story of any one year in this\r\nperiod, if treated chronologically, would branch off in a great many\r\ndifferent directions, some going back to earlier work, others forward to\r\narts not yet within the general survey; and the effect of such treatment\r\nwould be confusing. In like manner the development of the Edison\r\nlighting system followed several concurrent, simultaneous lines of\r\nadvance; and an effort was therefore made in the last chapter to give\r\na rapid glance over the whole movement, embracing a term of nearly five\r\nyears, and including in its scope both the Old World and the New. What\r\nis necessary to the completeness of the story at this stage is not to\r\nrecapitulate, but to take up some of the loose ends of threads woven\r\nin and follow them through until the clear and comprehensive picture of\r\nevents can be seen.\r\n\r\nSome things it would be difficult to reproduce in any picture of the art\r\nand the times. One of the greatest delusions of the public in regard\r\nto any notable invention is the belief that the world is waiting for it\r\nwith open arms and an eager welcome. The exact contrary is the truth.\r\nThere is not a single new art or device the world has ever enjoyed of\r\nwhich it can be said that it was given an immediate and enthusiastic\r\nreception. The way of the inventor is hard. He can sometimes raise\r\ncapital to help him in working out his crude conceptions, but even then\r\nit is frequently done at a distressful cost of personal surrender. When\r\nthe result is achieved the invention makes its appeal on the score of\r\neconomy of material or of effort; and then \"labor\" often awaits with\r\ncrushing and tyrannical spirit to smash the apparatus or forbid its very\r\nuse. Where both capital and labor are agreed that the object is worthy\r\nof encouragement, there is the supreme indifference of the public to\r\novercome, and the stubborn resistance of pre-existing devices to combat.\r\nThe years of hardship and struggle are thus prolonged, the chagrin\r\nof poverty and neglect too frequently embitters the inventor's scanty\r\nbread; and one great spirit after another has succumbed to the defeat\r\nbeyond which lay the procrastinated triumph so dearly earned. Even in\r\nAmerica, where the adoption of improvements and innovations is regarded\r\nas so prompt and sure, and where the huge tolls of the Patent Office and\r\nthe courts bear witness to the ceaseless efforts of the inventor, it is\r\nimpossible to deny the sad truth that unconsciously society discourages\r\ninvention rather than invites it. Possibly our national optimism as\r\nrevealed in invention--the seeking a higher good--needs some check.\r\nPossibly the leaders would travel too fast and too far on the road\r\nto perfection if conservatism did not also play its salutary part in\r\ninsisting that the procession move forward as a whole.\r\n\r\nEdison and his electric light were happily more fortunate than other men\r\nand inventions, in the relative cordiality of the reception given them.\r\nThe merit was too obvious to remain unrecognized. Nevertheless, it was\r\nthrough intense hostility and opposition that the young art made its\r\nway, pushed forward by Edison's own strong personality and by his\r\nunbounded, unwavering faith in the ultimate success of his system. It\r\nmay seem strange that great effort was required to introduce a light so\r\nmanifestly convenient, safe, agreeable, and advantageous, but the\r\nfacts are matter of record; and to-day the recollection of some of the\r\nepisodes brings a fierce glitter into the eye and keen indignation into\r\nthe voice of the man who has come so victoriously through it all.\r\n\r\nIt was not a fact at any time that the public was opposed to the idea of\r\nthe electric light. On the contrary, the conditions for its acceptance\r\nhad been ripening fast. Yet the very vogue of the electric arc light\r\nmade harder the arrival of the incandescent. As a new illuminant for the\r\nstreets, the arc had become familiar, either as a direct substitute\r\nfor the low gas lamp along the sidewalk curb, or as a novel form of\r\nmoonlight, raised in groups at the top of lofty towers often a hundred\r\nand fifty feet high. Some of these lights were already in use for large\r\nindoor spaces, although the size of the unit, the deadly pressure of\r\nthe current, and the sputtering sparks from the carbons made them\r\nhighly objectionable for such purposes. A number of parent arc-lighting\r\ncompanies were in existence, and a great many local companies had\r\nbeen called into being under franchises for commercial business and to\r\nexecute regular city contracts for street lighting. In this manner a\r\ngood deal of capital and the energies of many prominent men in politics\r\nand business had been rallied distinctively to the support of arc\r\nlighting. Under the inventive leadership of such brilliant men as Brush,\r\nThomson, Weston, and Van Depoele--there were scores of others--the\r\nindustry had made considerable progress and the art had been firmly\r\nestablished. Here lurked, however, very vigorous elements of opposition,\r\nfor Edison predicted from the start the superiority of the small\r\nelectric unit of light, and devoted himself exclusively to its\r\nperfection and introduction. It can be readily seen that this situation\r\nmade it all the more difficult for the Edison system to secure the large\r\nsums of money needed for its exploitation, and to obtain new franchises\r\nor city ordinances as a public utility. Thus in a curious manner the\r\nmodern art of electric lighting was in a very true sense divided against\r\nitself, with intense rivalries and jealousies which were none the less\r\nreal because they were but temporary and occurred in a field where\r\nultimate union of forces was inevitable. For a long period the arc\r\nwas dominant and supreme in the lighting branch of the electrical\r\nindustries, in all respects, whether as to investment, employees,\r\nincome, and profits, or in respect to the manufacturing side. When\r\nthe great National Electric Light Association was formed in 1885, its\r\norganizers were the captains of arc lighting, and not a single Edison\r\ncompany or licensee could be found in its ranks, or dared to solicit\r\nmembership. The Edison companies, soon numbering about three hundred,\r\nformed their own association--still maintained as a separate and useful\r\nbody--and the lines were tensely drawn in a way that made it none too\r\neasy for the Edison service to advance, or for an impartial man\r\nto remain friendly with both sides. But the growing popularity of\r\nincandescent lighting, the flexibility and safety of the system, the\r\nease with which other electric devices for heat, power, etc., could be\r\nput indiscriminately on the same circuits with the lamps, in due course\r\nrendered the old attitude of opposition obviously foolish and untenable.\r\nThe United States Census Office statistics of 1902 show that the income\r\nfrom incandescent lighting by central stations had by that time become\r\nover 52 per cent. of the total, while that from arc lighting was less\r\nthan 29; and electric-power service due to the ease with which motors\r\ncould be introduced on incandescent circuits brought in 15 per\r\ncent. more. Hence twenty years after the first Edison stations were\r\nestablished the methods they involved could be fairly credited with no\r\nless than 67 per cent. of all central-station income in the country, and\r\nthe proportion has grown since then. It will be readily understood\r\nthat under these conditions the modern lighting company supplies to its\r\ncustomers both incandescent and arc lighting, frequently from the same\r\ndynamo-electric machinery as a source of current; and that the old feud\r\nas between the rival systems has died out. In fact, for some years past\r\nthe presidents of the National Electric Light Association have been\r\nchosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great Edison\r\nlighting companies in the leading cities.\r\n\r\nThe other strong opposition to the incandescent light came from the gas\r\nindustry. There also the most bitter feeling was shown. The gas manager\r\ndid not like the arc light, but it interfered only with his street\r\nservice, which was not his largest source of income by any means. What\r\ndid arouse his ire and indignation was to find this new opponent, the\r\nlittle incandescent lamp, pushing boldly into the field of interior\r\nlighting, claiming it on a great variety of grounds of superiority, and\r\ncalmly ignoring the question of price, because it was so much better.\r\nNewspaper records and the pages of the technical papers of the day\r\nshow to what an extent prejudice and passion were stirred up and the\r\nastounding degree to which the opposition to the new light was carried.\r\n\r\nHere again was given a most convincing demonstration of the truth that\r\nsuch an addition to the resources of mankind always carries with it\r\nunsuspected benefits even for its enemies. In two distinct directions\r\nthe gas art was immediately helped by Edison's work. The competition was\r\nmost salutary in the stimulus it gave to improvements in processes for\r\nmaking, distributing, and using gas, so that while vast economies have\r\nbeen effected at the gas works, the customer has had an infinitely\r\nbetter light for less money. In the second place, the coming of the\r\nincandescent light raised the standard of illumination in such a manner\r\nthat more gas than ever was wanted in order to satisfy the popular\r\ndemand for brightness and brilliancy both indoors and on the street. The\r\nresult of the operation of these two forces acting upon it wholly from\r\nwithout, and from a rival it was desired to crush, has been to increase\r\nenormously the production and use of gas in the last twenty-five\r\nyears. It is true that the income of the central stations is now over\r\n$300,000,000 a year, and that isolated-plant lighting represents also a\r\nlarge amount of diverted business; but as just shown, it would obviously\r\nbe unfair to regard all this as a loss from the standpoint of gas. It is\r\nin great measure due to new sources of income developed by electricity\r\nfor itself.\r\n\r\nA retrospective survey shows that had the men in control of the American\r\ngas-lighting art, in 1880, been sufficiently far-sighted, and had they\r\ntaken a broader view of the situation, they might easily have remained\r\ndominant in the whole field of artificial lighting by securing the\r\nownership of the patents and devices of the new industry. Apparently not\r\na single step of that kind was undertaken, nor probably was there a gas\r\nmanager who would have agreed with Edison in the opinion written down\r\nby him at the time in little note-book No. 184, that gas properties were\r\nhaving conferred on them an enhanced earning capacity. It was doubtless\r\nfortunate and providential for the electric-lighting art that in its\r\nstate of immature development it did not fall into the hands of men\r\nwho were opposed to its growth, and would not have sought its technical\r\nperfection. It was allowed to carve out its own career, and thus escaped\r\nthe fate that is supposed to have attended other great inventions--of\r\nbeing bought up merely for purposes of suppression. There is a vague\r\npopular notion that this happens to the public loss; but the truth is\r\nthat no discovery of any real value is ever entirely lost. It may be\r\nretarded; but that is all. In the case of the gas companies and the\r\nincandescent light, many of them to whom it was in the early days as\r\ngreat an irritant as a red flag to a bull, emulated the performance of\r\nthat animal and spent a great deal of money and energy in bellowing and\r\nthrowing up dirt in the effort to destroy the hated enemy. This was not\r\nlong nor universally the spirit shown; and to-day in hundreds of cities\r\nthe electric and gas properties are united under the one management,\r\nwhich does not find it impossible to push in a friendly and progressive\r\nway the use of both illuminants. The most conspicuous example of this\r\nidentity of interest is given in New York itself.\r\n\r\nSo much for the early opposition, of which there was plenty. But it may\r\nbe questioned whether inertia is not equally to be dreaded with active\r\nill-will. Nothing is more difficult in the world than to get a good many\r\nhundreds of thousands or millions of people to do something they have\r\nnever done before. A very real difficulty in the introduction of his\r\nlamp and lighting system by Edison lay in the absolute ignorance of\r\nthe public at large, not only as to its merits, but as to the very\r\nappearance of the light, Some few thousand people had gone out to Menlo\r\nPark, and had there seen the lamps in operation at the laboratory or\r\non the hillsides, but they were an insignificant proportion of the\r\ninhabitants of the United States. Of course, a great many accounts\r\nwere written and read, but while genuine interest was aroused it was\r\nnecessarily apathetic. A newspaper description or a magazine article\r\nmay be admirably complete in itself, with illustrations, but until some\r\npersonal experience is had of the thing described it does not convey\r\na perfect mental picture, nor can it always make the desire active and\r\ninsistent. Generally, people wait to have the new thing brought to them;\r\nand hence, as in the case of the Edison light, an educational campaign\r\nof a practical nature is a fundamental condition of success.\r\n\r\nAnother serious difficulty confronting Edison and his associates\r\nwas that nowhere in the world were there to be purchased any of the\r\nappliances necessary for the use of the lighting system. Edison had\r\nresolved from the very first that the initial central station embodying\r\nhis various ideas should be installed in New York City, where he could\r\nsuperintend the installation personally, and then watch the operation.\r\nPlans to that end were now rapidly maturing; but there would be needed\r\namong many other things--every one of them new and novel--dynamos,\r\nswitchboards, regulators, pressure and current indicators, fixtures\r\nin great variety, incandescent lamps, meters, sockets, small switches,\r\nunderground conductors, junction-boxes, service-boxes, manhole-boxes,\r\nconnectors, and even specially made wire. Now, not one of these\r\nmiscellaneous things was in existence; not an outsider was sufficiently\r\ninformed about such devices to make them on order, except perhaps the\r\nspecial wire. Edison therefore started first of all a lamp factory in\r\none of the buildings at Menlo Park, equipped it with novel machinery and\r\napparatus, and began to instruct men, boys, and girls, as they could be\r\nenlisted, in the absolutely new art, putting Mr. Upton in charge.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the conditions attendant upon the manufacture of the\r\nlamps, Edison says: \"When we first started the electric light we had to\r\nhave a factory for manufacturing lamps. As the Edison Light Company\r\ndid not seem disposed to go into manufacturing, we started a small\r\nlamp factory at Menlo Park with what money I could raise from my other\r\ninventions and royalties, and some assistance. The lamps at that time\r\nwere costing about $1.25 each to make, so I said to the company: 'If you\r\nwill give me a contract during the life of the patents, I will make all\r\nthe lamps required by the company and deliver them for forty cents.' The\r\ncompany jumped at the chance of this offer, and a contract was drawn\r\nup. We then bought at a receiver's sale at Harrison, New Jersey, a very\r\nlarge brick factory building which had been used as an oil-cloth works.\r\nWe got it at a great bargain, and only paid a small sum down, and\r\nthe balance on mortgage. We moved the lamp works from Menlo Park to\r\nHarrison. The first year the lamps cost us about $1.10 each. We sold\r\nthem for forty cents; but there were only about twenty or thirty\r\nthousand of them. The next year they cost us about seventy cents, and we\r\nsold them for forty. There were a good many, and we lost more money the\r\nsecond year than the first. The third year I succeeded in getting up\r\nmachinery and in changing the processes, until it got down so that they\r\ncost somewhere around fifty cents. I still sold them for forty cents,\r\nand lost more money that year than any other, because the sales were\r\nincreasing rapidly. The fourth year I got it down to thirty-seven cents,\r\nand I made all the money up in one year that I had lost previously. I\r\nfinally got it down to twenty-two cents, and sold them for forty cents;\r\nand they were made by the million. Whereupon the Wall Street people\r\nthought it was a very lucrative business, so they concluded they would\r\nlike to have it, and bought us out.\r\n\r\n\"One of the incidents which caused a very great cheapening was that,\r\nwhen we started, one of the important processes had to be done by\r\nexperts. This was the sealing on of the part carrying the filament into\r\nthe globe, which was rather a delicate operation in those days, and\r\nrequired several months of training before any one could seal in a fair\r\nnumber of parts in a day. When we got to the point where we employed\r\neighty of these experts they formed a union; and knowing it was\r\nimpossible to manufacture lamps without them, they became very insolent.\r\nOne instance was that the son of one of these experts was employed in\r\nthe office, and when he was told to do anything would not do it, or\r\nwould give an insolent reply. He was discharged, whereupon the union\r\nnotified us that unless the boy was taken back the whole body would go\r\nout. It got so bad that the manager came to me and said he could not\r\nstand it any longer; something had got to be done. They were not only\r\nmore surly; they were diminishing the output, and it became impossible\r\nto manage the works. He got me enthused on the subject, so I started in\r\nto see if it were not possible to do that operation by machinery. After\r\nfeeling around for some days I got a clew how to do it. I then put men\r\non it I could trust, and made the preliminary machinery. That seemed to\r\nwork pretty well. I then made another machine which did the work nicely.\r\nI then made a third machine, and would bring in yard men, ordinary\r\nlaborers, etc., and when I could get these men to put the parts together\r\nas well as the trained experts, in an hour, I considered the machine\r\ncomplete. I then went secretly to work and made thirty of the machines.\r\nUp in the top loft of the factory we stored those machines, and at night\r\nwe put up the benches and got everything all ready. Then we discharged\r\nthe office-boy. Then the union went out. It has been out ever since.\r\n\r\n\"When we formed the works at Harrison we divided the interests into one\r\nhundred shares or parts at $100 par. One of the boys was hard up after\r\na time, and sold two shares to Bob Cutting. Up to that time we had never\r\npaid anything; but we got around to the point where the board declared\r\na dividend every Saturday night. We had never declared a dividend when\r\nCutting bought his shares, and after getting his dividends for three\r\nweeks in succession, he called up on the telephone and wanted to know\r\nwhat kind of a concern this was that paid a weekly dividend. The works\r\nsold for $1,085,000.\"\r\n\r\nIncidentally it may be noted, as illustrative of the problems brought\r\nto Edison, that while he had the factory at Harrison an importer in the\r\nChinese trade went to him and wanted a dynamo to be run by hand power.\r\nThe importer explained that in China human labor was cheaper than steam\r\npower. Edison devised a machine to answer the purpose, and put long\r\nspokes on it, fitted it up, and shipped it to China. He has not,\r\nhowever, heard of it since.\r\n\r\nFor making the dynamos Edison secured, as noted in the preceding\r\nchapter, the Roach Iron Works on Goerck Street, New York, and this\r\nwas also equipped. A building was rented on Washington Street, where\r\nmachinery and tools were put in specially designed for making the\r\nunderground tube conductors and their various paraphernalia; and the\r\nfaithful John Kruesi was given charge of that branch of production. To\r\nSigmund Bergmann, who had worked previously with Edison on telephone\r\napparatus and phonographs, and was already making Edison specialties in\r\na small way in a loft on Wooster Street, New York, was assigned the task\r\nof constructing sockets, fixtures, meters, safety fuses, and numerous\r\nother details.\r\n\r\nThus, broadly, the manufacturing end of the problem of introduction was\r\ncared for. In the early part of 1881 the Edison Electric Light Company\r\nleased the old Bishop mansion at 65 Fifth Avenue, close to Fourteenth\r\nStreet, for its headquarters and show-rooms. This was one of the finest\r\nhomes in the city of that period, and its acquisition was a premonitory\r\nsign of the surrender of the famous residential avenue to commerce. The\r\ncompany needed not only offices, but, even more, such an interior as\r\nwould display to advantage the new light in everyday use; and this house\r\nwith its liberal lines, spacious halls, lofty ceilings, wide parlors,\r\nand graceful, winding stairway was ideal for the purpose. In fact, in\r\nundergoing this violent change, it did not cease to be a home in the\r\nreal sense, for to this day many an Edison veteran's pulse is quickened\r\nby some chance reference to \"65,\" where through many years the work of\r\ndevelopment by a loyal and devoted band of workers was centred. Here\r\nEdison and a few of his assistants from Menlo Park installed immediately\r\nin the basement a small generating plant, at first with a gas-engine\r\nwhich was not successful, and then with a Hampson high-speed engine and\r\nboiler, constituting a complete isolated plant. The building was wired\r\nfrom top to bottom, and equipped with all the appliances of the art. The\r\nexperience with the little gas-engine was rather startling. \"At an early\r\nperiod at '65' we decided,\" says Edison, \"to light it up with the Edison\r\nsystem, and put a gas-engine in the cellar, using city gas. One day it\r\nwas not going very well, and I went down to the man in charge and got\r\nexploring around. Finally I opened the pedestal--a storehouse for tools,\r\netc. We had an open lamp, and when we opened the pedestal, it blew the\r\ndoors off, and blew out the windows, and knocked me down, and the other\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next four or five years \"65\" was a veritable beehive, day and\r\nnight. The routine was very much the same as that at the laboratory, in\r\nits utter neglect of the clock. The evenings were not only devoted to\r\nthe continuance of regular business, but the house was thrown open to\r\nthe public until late at night, never closing before ten o'clock, so as\r\nto give everybody who wished an opportunity to see that great novelty\r\nof the time--the incandescent light--whose fame had meanwhile been\r\nspreading all over the globe. The first year, 1881, was naturally that\r\nwhich witnessed the greatest rush of visitors; and the building hardly\r\never closed its doors till midnight. During the day business was carried\r\non under great stress, and Mr. Insull has described how Edison was to\r\nbe found there trying to lead the life of a man of affairs in the\r\nconventional garb of polite society, instead of pursuing inventions and\r\nresearches in his laboratory. But the disagreeable ordeal could not be\r\ndodged. After the experience Edison could never again be tempted to quit\r\nhis laboratory and work for any length of time; but in this instance\r\nthere were some advantages attached to the sacrifice, for the crowds of\r\nlion-hunters and people seeking business arrangements would only have\r\ngone out to Menlo Park; while, on the other hand, the great plans for\r\nlighting New York demanded very close personal attention on the spot.\r\n\r\nAs it was, not only Edison, but all the company's directors, officers,\r\nand employees, were kept busy exhibiting and explaining the light. To\r\nthe public of that day, when the highest known form of house illuminant\r\nwas gas, the incandescent lamp, with its ability to burn in any\r\nposition, its lack of heat so that you could put your hand on the\r\nbrilliant glass globe; the absence of any vitiating effect on the\r\natmosphere, the obvious safety from fire; the curious fact that you\r\nneeded no matches to light it, and that it was under absolute control\r\nfrom a distance--these and many other features came as a distinct\r\nrevelation and marvel, while promising so much additional comfort,\r\nconvenience, and beauty in the home, that inspection was almost\r\ninvariably followed by a request for installation.\r\n\r\nThe camaraderie that existed at this time was very democratic, for all\r\nwere workers in a common cause; all were enthusiastic believers in the\r\ndoctrine they proclaimed, and hoped to profit by the opening up of\r\nthe new art. Often at night, in the small hours, all would adjourn for\r\nrefreshments to a famous resort nearby, to discuss the events of to-day\r\nand to-morrow, full of incident and excitement. The easy relationship of\r\nthe time is neatly sketched by Edison in a humorous complaint as to his\r\ninability to keep his own cigars: \"When at '65' I used to have in my\r\ndesk a box of cigars. I would go to the box four or five times to get a\r\ncigar, but after it got circulated about the building, everybody would\r\ncome to get my cigars, so that the box would only last about a day and\r\na half. I was telling a gentleman one day that I could not keep a\r\ncigar. Even if I locked them up in my desk they would break it open. He\r\nsuggested to me that he had a friend over on Eighth Avenue who made a\r\nsuperior grade of cigars, and who would show them a trick. He said he\r\nwould have some of them made up with hair and old paper, and I could put\r\nthem in without a word and see the result. I thought no more about the\r\nmatter. He came in two or three months after, and said: 'How did that\r\ncigar business work?' I didn't remember anything about it. On coming to\r\ninvestigate, it appeared that the box of cigars had been delivered and\r\nhad been put in my desk, and I had smoked them all! I was too busy on\r\nother things to notice.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no uncommon sight to see in the parlors in the evening John\r\nPierpont Morgan, Norvin Green, Grosvenor P. Lowrey, Henry Villard,\r\nRobert L. Cutting, Edward D. Adams, J. Hood Wright, E. G. Fabbri, R.\r\nM. Galloway, and other men prominent in city life, many of them\r\nstock-holders and directors; all interested in doing this educational\r\nwork. Thousands of persons thus came--bankers, brokers, lawyers,\r\neditors, and reporters, prominent business men, electricians, insurance\r\nexperts, under whose searching and intelligent inquiries the facts were\r\nelicited, and general admiration was soon won for the system, which in\r\nadvance had solved so many new problems. Edison himself was in universal\r\nrequest and the subject of much adulation, but altogether too busy and\r\nmodest to be spoiled by it. Once in a while he felt it his duty to go\r\nover the ground with scientific visitors, many of whom were from abroad,\r\nand discuss questions which were not simply those of technique, but\r\nrelated to newer phenomena, such as the action of carbon, the nature\r\nand effects of high vacua; the principles of electrical subdivision; the\r\nvalue of insulation, and many others which, unfortunate to say, remain\r\nas esoteric now as they were then, ever fruitful themes of controversy.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of those days or nights, Edison says: \"Years ago one of the\r\ngreat violinists was Remenyi. After his performances were over he used\r\nto come down to '65' and talk economics, philosophy, moral science, and\r\neverything else. He was highly educated and had great mental capacity.\r\nHe would talk with me, but I never asked him to bring his violin. One\r\nnight he came with his violin, about twelve o'clock. I had a library\r\nat the top of the house, and Remenyi came up there. He was in a genial\r\nhumor, and played the violin for me for about two hours--$2000 worth.\r\nThe front doors were closed, and he walked up and down the room as he\r\nplayed. After that, every time he came to New York he used to call at\r\n'65' late at night with his violin. If we were not there, he could come\r\ndown to the slums at Goerck Street, and would play for an hour or two\r\nand talk philosophy. I would talk for the benefit of his music. Henry E.\r\nDixey, then at the height of his 'Adonis' popularity, would come in\r\nin those days, after theatre hours, and would entertain us with\r\nstories--1882-84. Another visitor who used to give us a good deal of\r\namusement and pleasure was Captain Shaw, the head of the London Fire\r\nBrigade. He was good company. He would go out among the fire-laddies\r\nand have a great time. One time Robert Lincoln and Anson Stager, of the\r\nWestern Union, interested in the electric light, came on to make some\r\narrangement with Major Eaton, President of the Edison Electric Light\r\nCompany. They came to '65' in the afternoon, and Lincoln commenced\r\ntelling stories--like his father. They told stories all the afternoon,\r\nand that night they left for Chicago. When they got to Cleveland, it\r\ndawned upon them that they had not done any business, so they had\r\nto come back on the next train to New York to transact it. They were\r\ninterested in the Chicago Edison Company, now one of the largest of the\r\nsystems in the world. Speaking of telling stories, I once got telling\r\na man stories at the Harrison lamp factory, in the yard, as he was\r\nleaving. It was winter, and he was all in furs. I had nothing on to\r\nprotect me against the cold. I told him one story after the other--six\r\nof them. Then I got pleurisy, and had to be shipped to Florida for\r\ncure.\"\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Edison Electric Light Company went back to 1878;\r\nbut up to the time of leasing 65 Fifth Avenue it had not been engaged\r\nin actual business. It had merely enjoyed the delights of anxious\r\nanticipation, and the perilous pleasure of backing Edison's experiments.\r\nNow active exploitation was required. Dr. Norvin Green, the well-known\r\nPresident of the Western Union Telegraph Company, was president also of\r\nthe Edison Company, but the pressing nature of his regular duties\r\nleft him no leisure for such close responsible management as was now\r\nrequired. Early in 1881 Mr. Grosvenor P. Lowrey, after consultation with\r\nMr. Edison, prevailed upon Major S. B. Eaton, the leading member of\r\na very prominent law firm in New York, to accept the position of\r\nvice-president and general manager of the company, in which, as also in\r\nsome of the subsidiary Edison companies, and as president, he continued\r\nactively and energetically for nearly four years, a critical, formative\r\nperiod in which the solidity of the foundation laid is attested by the\r\nmagnitude and splendor of the superstructure.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Edison conferred at this point with Mr. Lowrey should,\r\nperhaps, be explained in justice to the distinguished lawyer, who for so\r\nmany years was the close friend of the inventor, and the chief counsel\r\nin all the tremendous litigation that followed the effort to enforce and\r\nvalidate the Edison patents. As in England Mr. Edison was fortunate in\r\nsecuring the legal assistance of Sir Richard Webster, afterward Lord\r\nChief Justice of England, so in America it counted greatly in his favor\r\nto enjoy the advocacy of such a man as Lowrey, prominent among the\r\nfamous leaders of the New York bar. Born in Massachusetts, Mr. Lowrey,\r\nin his earlier days of straitened circumstances, was accustomed to\r\ndefray some portion of his educational expenses by teaching music in the\r\nBerkshire villages, and by a curious coincidence one of his pupils\r\nwas F. L. Pope, later Edison's partner for a time. Lowrey went West to\r\n\"Bleeding Kansas\" with the first Governor, Reeder, and both were active\r\nparticipants in the exciting scenes of the \"Free State\" war until driven\r\naway in 1856, like many other free-soilers, by the acts of the \"Border\r\nRuffian\" legislature. Returning East, Mr. Lowrey took up practice in New\r\nYork, soon becoming eminent in his profession, and upon the accession of\r\nWilliam Orton to the presidency of the Western Union Telegraph Company\r\nin 1866, he was appointed its general counsel, the duties of which post\r\nhe discharged for fifteen years. One of the great cases in which he\r\nthus took a leading and distinguished part was that of the quadruplex\r\ntelegraph; and later he acted as legal adviser to Henry Villard in his\r\nnumerous grandiose enterprises. Lowrey thus came to know Edison, to\r\nconceive an intense admiration for him, and to believe in his ability\r\nat a time when others could not detect the fire of genius smouldering\r\nbeneath the modest exterior of a gaunt young operator slowly\r\n\"finding himself.\" It will be seen that Mr Lowrey was in a peculiarly\r\nadvantageous position to make his convictions about Edison felt, so\r\nthat it was he and his friends who rallied quickly to the new banner\r\nof discovery, and lent to the inventor the aid that came at a critical\r\nperiod. In this connection it may be well to quote an article that\r\nappeared at the time of Mr. Lowrey's death, in 1893: \"One of the most\r\nimportant services which Mr. Lowrey has ever performed was in furnishing\r\nand procuring the necessary financial backing for Thomas A. Edison in\r\nbringing out and perfecting his system of incandescent lighting. With\r\ncharacteristic pertinacity, Mr. Lowrey stood by the inventor through\r\nthick and thin, in spite of doubt, discouragement, and ridicule, until\r\nat last success crowned his efforts. In all the litigation which has\r\nresulted from the wide-spread infringements of the Edison patents, Mr.\r\nLowrey has ever borne the burden and heat of the day, and perhaps in\r\nno other field has he so personally distinguished himself as in the\r\nsuccessful advocacy of the claims of Edison to the invention of the\r\nincandescent lamp and everything 'hereunto pertaining.'\"\r\n\r\nThis was the man of whom Edison had necessarily to make a confidant and\r\nadviser, and who supplied other things besides the legal direction and\r\nfinancial alliance, by his knowledge of the world and of affairs. There\r\nwere many vital things to be done in the exploitation of the system that\r\nEdison simply could not and would not do; but in Lowrey's savoir faire,\r\nready wit and humor, chivalry of devotion, graceful eloquence, and\r\nadmirable equipoise of judgment were all the qualities that the occasion\r\ndemanded and that met the exigencies.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. Insull for a graphic sketch of Edison at this\r\nperiod, and of the conditions under which work was done and progress was\r\nmade: \"I do not think I had any understanding with Edison when I first\r\nwent with him as to my duties. I did whatever he told me, and looked\r\nafter all kinds of affairs, from buying his clothes to financing his\r\nbusiness. I used to open the correspondence and answer it all, sometimes\r\nsigning Edison's name with my initial, and sometimes signing my own\r\nname. If the latter course was pursued, and I was addressing a stranger,\r\nI would sign as Edison's private secretary. I held his power of\r\nattorney, and signed his checks. It was seldom that Edison signed\r\na letter or check at this time. If he wanted personally to send a\r\ncommunication to anybody, if it was one of his close associates, it\r\nwould probably be a pencil memorandum signed 'Edison.' I was a shorthand\r\nwriter, but seldom took down from Edison's dictation, unless it was on\r\nsome technical subject that I did not understand. I would go over\r\nthe correspondence with Edison, sometimes making a marginal note in\r\nshorthand, and sometimes Edison would make his own notes on letters, and\r\nI would be expected to clean up the correspondence with Edison's laconic\r\ncomments as a guide as to the character of answer to make. It was a very\r\ncommon thing for Edison to write the words 'Yes' or 'No,' and this would\r\nbe all I had on which to base my answer. Edison marginalized documents\r\nextensively. He had a wonderful ability in pointing out the weak points\r\nof an agreement or a balance-sheet, all the while protesting he was no\r\nlawyer or accountant; and his views were expressed in very few words,\r\nbut in a characteristic and emphatic manner.\r\n\r\n\"The first few months I was with Edison he spent most of the time in the\r\noffice at 65 Fifth Avenue. Then there was a great deal of trouble with\r\nthe life of the lamps there, and he disappeared from the office and\r\nspent his time largely at Menlo Park. At another time there was a great\r\ndeal of trouble with some of the details of construction of the dynamos,\r\nand Edison spent a lot of time at Goerck Street, which had been rapidly\r\nequipped with the idea of turning out bi-polar dynamo-electric machines,\r\ndirect-connected to the engine, the first of which went to Paris and\r\nLondon, while the next were installed in the old Pearl Street station\r\nof the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of New York, just south of\r\nFulton Street, on the west side of the street. Edison devoted a great\r\ndeal of his time to the engineering work in connection with the laying\r\nout of the first incandescent electric-lighting system in New York.\r\nApparently at that time--between the end of 1881 and spring of 1882--the\r\nmost serious work was the manufacture and installation of underground\r\nconductors in this territory. These conductors were manufactured by\r\nthe Electric Tube Company, which Edison controlled in a shop at 65\r\nWashington Street, run by John Kruesi. Half-round copper conductors were\r\nused, kept in place relatively to each other and in the tube, first of\r\nall by a heavy piece of cardboard, and later on by a rope; and then put\r\nin a twenty-foot iron pipe; and a combination of asphaltum and linseed\r\noil was forced into the pipe for the insulation. I remember as a\r\ncoincidence that the building was only twenty feet wide. These lengths\r\nof conductors were twenty feet six inches long, as the half-round\r\ncoppers extended three inches beyond the drag-ends of the lengths of\r\npipe; and in one of the operations we used to take the length of tubing\r\nout of the window in order to turn it around. I was elected secretary of\r\nthe Electric Tube Company, and was expected to look after its finance;\r\nand it was in this position that my long intimacy with John Kruesi\r\nstarted.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a large part of the correspondence referred very\r\nnaturally to electric lighting, embodying requests for all kinds of\r\ninformation, catalogues, prices, terms, etc.; and all these letters were\r\nturned over to the lighting company by Edison for attention. The company\r\nwas soon swamped with propositions for sale of territorial rights and\r\nwith other negotiations, and some of these were accompanied by the offer\r\nof very large sums of money. It was the beginning of the electric-light\r\nfuror which soon rose to sensational heights. Had the company accepted\r\nthe cash offers from various localities, it could have gathered several\r\nmillions of dollars at once into its treasury; but this was not at\r\nall in accord with Mr. Edison's idea, which was to prove by actual\r\nexperience the commercial value of the system, and then to license\r\ncentral-station companies in large cities and towns, the parent company\r\ntaking a percentage of their capital for the license under the Edison\r\npatents, and contracting also for the supply of apparatus, lamps, etc.\r\nThis left the remainder of the country open for the cash sale of plants\r\nwherever requested. His counsels prevailed, and the wisdom of the policy\r\nadopted was seen in the swift establishment of Edison companies in\r\ncentres of population both great and small, whose business has ever been\r\na constant and growing source of income for the parent manufacturing\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last Edison has been an exponent and advocate of the\r\ncentral-station idea of distribution now so familiar to the public mind,\r\nbut still very far from being carried out to its logical conclusion.\r\nIn this instance, demands for isolated plants for lighting factories,\r\nmills, mines, hotels, etc., began to pour in, and something had to be\r\ndone with them. This was a class of plant which the inquirers desired to\r\npurchase outright and operate themselves, usually because of remoteness\r\nfrom any possible source of general supply of current. It had not been\r\nEdison's intention to cater to this class of customer until his broad\r\ncentral-station plan had been worked out, and he has always discouraged\r\nthe isolated plant within the limits of urban circuits; but this demand\r\nwas so insistent it could not be denied, and it was deemed desirable to\r\ncomply with it at once, especially as it was seen that the steady call\r\nfor supplies and renewals would benefit the new Edison manufacturing\r\nplants. After a very short trial, it was found necessary to create\r\na separate organization for this branch of the industry, leaving the\r\nEdison Electric Light Company to continue under the original plan of\r\noperation as a parent, patent-holding and licensing company. Accordingly\r\na new and distinct corporation was formed called the Edison Company for\r\nIsolated Lighting, to which was issued a special license to sell and\r\noperate plants of a self-contained character. As a matter of fact such\r\nwork began in advance of almost every other kind. A small plant using\r\nthe paper-carbon filament lamps was furnished by Edison at the earnest\r\nsolicitation of Mr. Henry Villard for the steamship Columbia, in 1879,\r\nand it is amusing to note that Mr. Upton carried the lamps himself\r\nto the ship, very tenderly and jealously, like fresh eggs, in a\r\nmarket-garden basket. The installation was most successful. Another\r\npioneer plant was that equipped and started in January, 1881, for Hinds\r\n& Ketcham, a New York firm of lithographers and color printers, who\r\nhad previously been able to work only by day, owing to difficulties in\r\ncolor-printing by artificial light. A year later they said: \"It is the\r\nbest substitute for daylight we have ever known, and almost as cheap.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edison himself describes various instances in which the demand for\r\nisolated plants had to be met: \"One night at '65,'\" he says, \"James\r\nGordon Bennett came in. We were very anxious to get into a printing\r\nestablishment. I had caused a printer's composing case to be set up with\r\nthe idea that if we could get editors and publishers in to see it, we\r\nshould show them the advantages of the electric light. So ultimately\r\nMr. Bennett came, and after seeing the whole operation of everything,\r\nhe ordered Mr. Howland, general manager of the Herald, to light the\r\nnewspaper offices up at once with electricity.\"\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the same kind deals with the introduction of the\r\nlight for purely social purposes: \"While at 65 Fifth Avenue,\" remarks\r\nMr. Edison, \"I got to know Christian Herter, then the largest decorator\r\nin the United States. He was a highly intellectual man, and I loved to\r\ntalk to him. He was always railing against the rich people, for whom\r\nhe did work, for their poor taste. One day Mr. W. H. Vanderbilt came\r\nto '65,' saw the light, and decided that he would have his new house\r\nlighted with it. This was one of the big 'box houses' on upper Fifth\r\nAvenue. He put the whole matter in the hands of his son-in-law, Mr. H.\r\nMcK. Twombly, who was then in charge of the telephone department of\r\nthe Western Union. Twombly closed the contract with us for a plant. Mr.\r\nHerter was doing the decoration, and it was extraordinarily fine. After\r\na while we got the engines and boilers and wires all done, and the\r\nlights in position, before the house was quite finished, and thought we\r\nwould have an exhibit of the light. About eight o'clock in the evening\r\nwe lit up, and it was very good. Mr. Vanderbilt and his wife and some\r\nof his daughters came in, and were there a few minutes when a fire\r\noccurred. The large picture-gallery was lined with silk cloth interwoven\r\nwith fine metallic thread. In some manner two wires had got crossed with\r\nthis tinsel, which became red-hot, and the whole mass was soon afire. I\r\nknew what was the matter, and ordered them to run down and shut off.\r\nIt had not burst into flame, and died out immediately. Mrs. Vanderbilt\r\nbecame hysterical, and wanted to know where it came from. We told her we\r\nhad the plant in the cellar, and when she learned we had a boiler there\r\nshe said she would not occupy the house. She would not live over a\r\nboiler. We had to take the whole installation out. The houses afterward\r\nwent onto the New York Edison system.\"\r\n\r\nThe art was, however, very crude and raw, and as there were no artisans\r\nin existence as mechanics or electricians who had any knowledge of the\r\npractice, there was inconceivable difficulty in getting such isolated\r\nplants installed, as well as wiring the buildings in the district to be\r\ncovered by the first central station in New York. A night school was,\r\ntherefore, founded at Fifth Avenue, and was put in charge of Mr. E. H.\r\nJohnson, fresh from his successes in England. The most available men for\r\nthe purpose were, of course, those who had been accustomed to wiring\r\nfor the simpler electrical systems then in vogue--telephones,\r\ndistrict-messenger calls, burglar alarms, house annunciators, etc., and\r\na number of these \"wiremen\" were engaged and instructed patiently in\r\nthe rudiments of the new art by means of a blackboard and oral lessons.\r\nStudents from the technical schools and colleges were also eager\r\nrecruits, for here was something that promised a career, and one that\r\nwas especially alluring to youth because of its novelty. These beginners\r\nwere also instructed in general engineering problems under the guidance\r\nof Mr. C. L. Clarke, who was brought in from the Menlo Park laboratory\r\nto assume charge of the engineering part of the company's affairs.\r\nMany of these pioneer students and workmen became afterward large and\r\nsuccessful contractors, or have filled positions of distinction\r\nas managers and superintendents of central stations. Possibly the\r\nelectrical industry may not now attract as much adventurous genius as it\r\ndid then, for automobiles, aeronautics, and other new arts have come\r\nto the front in a quarter of a century to enlist the enthusiasm of a\r\nyounger generation of mercurial spirits; but it is certain that at the\r\nperiod of which we write, Edison himself, still under thirty-five, was\r\nthe centre of an extraordinary group of men, full of effervescing and\r\naspiring talent, to which he gave glorious opportunity.\r\n\r\nA very novel literary feature of the work was the issuance of a bulletin\r\ndevoted entirely to the Edison lighting propaganda. Nowadays the\r\n\"house organ,\" as it is called, has become a very hackneyed feature\r\nof industrial development, confusing in its variety and volume, and\r\na somewhat doubtful adjunct to a highly perfected, widely circulating\r\nperiodical technical press. But at that time, 1882, the Bulletin of\r\nthe Edison Electric Light Company, published in ordinary 12mo form, was\r\ndistinctly new in advertising and possibly unique, as it is difficult\r\nto find anything that compared with it. The Bulletin was carried on for\r\nsome years, until its necessity was removed by the development of other\r\nopportunities for reaching the public; and its pages serve now as a\r\nvivid and lively picture of the period to which its record applies. The\r\nfirst issue, of January 12, 1882, was only four pages, but it dealt\r\nwith the question of insurance; plants at Santiago, Chili, and Rio de\r\nJaneiro; the European Company with 3,500,000 francs subscribed; the work\r\nin Paris, London, Strasburg, and Moscow; the laying of over six miles of\r\nstreet mains in New York; a patent decision in favor of Edison; and the\r\nsize of safety catch wire. By April of 1882, the Bulletin had attained\r\nthe respectable size of sixteen pages; and in December it was a portly\r\nmagazine of forty-eight. Every item bears testimony to the rapid\r\nprogress being made; and by the end of 1882 it is seen that no fewer\r\nthan 153 isolated Edison plants had been installed in the United States\r\nalone, with a capacity of 29,192 lamps. Moreover, the New York central\r\nstation had gone into operation, starting at 3 P.M. on September 4, and\r\nat the close of 1882 it was lighting 225 houses wired for about 5000\r\nlamps. This epochal story will be told in the next chapter. Most\r\ninteresting are the Bulletin notes from England, especially in regard\r\nto the brilliant exhibition given by Mr. E. H. Johnson at the Crystal\r\nPalace, Sydenham, visited by the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, twice by\r\nthe Dukes of Westminster and Sutherland, by three hundred members of\r\nthe Gas Institute, and by innumerable delegations from cities, boroughs,\r\netc. Describing this before the Royal Society of Arts, Sir W. H. Preece,\r\nF.R.S., remarked: \"Many unkind things have been said of Mr. Edison and\r\nhis promises; perhaps no one has been severer in this direction than\r\nmyself. It is some gratification for me to announce my belief that he\r\nhas at last solved the problem he set himself to solve, and to be able\r\nto describe to the Society the way in which he has solved it.\" Before\r\nthe exhibition closed it was visited by the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales--now the deceased Edward VII. and the Dowager Queen Alexandra--and\r\nthe Princess received from Mr. Johnson as a souvenir a tiny electric\r\nchandelier fashioned like a bouquet of fern leaves and flowers, the buds\r\nbeing some of the first miniature incandescent lamps ever made.\r\n\r\nThe first item in the first Bulletin dealt with the \"Fire Question,\" and\r\nall through the successive issues runs a series of significant items on\r\nthe same subject. Many of them are aimed at gas, and there are several\r\ngrim summaries of death and fires due to gas-leaks or explosions. A\r\ntendency existed at the time to assume that electricity was altogether\r\nsafe, while its opponents, predicating their attacks on arc-lighting\r\ncasualties, insisted it was most dangerous. Edison's problem in\r\neducating the public was rather difficult, for while his low-pressure,\r\ndirect-current system has always been absolutely without danger to life,\r\nthere has also been the undeniable fact that escaping electricity might\r\ncause a fire just as a leaky water-pipe can flood a house. The important\r\nquestion had arisen, therefore, of satisfying the fire underwriters\r\nas to the safety of the system. He had foreseen that there would be an\r\nabsolute necessity for special devices to prevent fires from occurring\r\nby reason of any excess of current flowing in any circuit; and several\r\nof his earliest detail lighting inventions deal with this subject. The\r\ninsurance underwriters of New York and other parts of the country gave\r\na great deal of time and study to the question through their most\r\nexpert representatives, with the aid of Edison and his associates, other\r\nelectric-light companies cooperating; and the knowledge thus gained\r\nwas embodied in insurance rules to govern wiring for electric lights,\r\nformulated during the latter part of 1881, adopted by the New York Board\r\nof Fire Underwriters, January 12, 1882, and subsequently endorsed\r\nby other boards in the various insurance districts. Under temporary\r\nrulings, however, a vast amount of work had already been done, but\r\nit was obvious that as the industry grew there would be less and less\r\npossibility of supervision except through such regulations, insisting\r\nupon the use of the best devices and methods. Indeed, the direct\r\nsuperintendence soon became unnecessary, owing to the increasing\r\nknowledge and greater skill acquired by the installing staff; and this\r\nsystem of education was notably improved by a manual written by Mr.\r\nEdison himself. Copies of this brochure are as scarce to-day as First\r\nFolio Shakespeares, and command prices equal to those of other American\r\nfirst editions. The little book is the only known incursion of its\r\nauthor into literature, if we except the brief articles he has written\r\nfor technical papers and for the magazines. It contained what was at\r\nonce a full, elaborate, and terse explanation of a complete isolated\r\nplant, with diagrams of various methods of connection and operation, and\r\na carefully detailed description of every individual part, its functions\r\nand its characteristics. The remarkable success of those early years was\r\nindeed only achieved by following up with Chinese exactness the minute\r\nand intimate methods insisted upon by Edison as to the use of the\r\napparatus and devices employed. It was a curious example of establishing\r\nstandard practice while changing with kaleidoscopic rapidity all the\r\nelements involved. He was true to an ideal as to the pole-star, but was\r\nincessantly making improvements in every direction. With an iconoclasm\r\nthat has often seemed ruthless and brutal he did not hesitate to\r\nsacrifice older devices the moment a new one came in sight that embodied\r\na real advance in securing effective results. The process is heroic but\r\ncostly. Nobody ever had a bigger scrap-heap than Edison; but who dare\r\nproclaim the process intrinsically wasteful if the losses occur in the\r\ninitial stages, and the economies in all the later ones?\r\n\r\nWith Edison in this introduction of his lighting system the method\r\nwas ruthless, but not reckless. At an early stage of the commercial\r\ndevelopment a standardizing committee was formed, consisting of the\r\nheads of all the departments, and to this body was intrusted the task of\r\ntesting and criticising all existing and proposed devices, as well as of\r\nconsidering the suggestions and complaints of workmen offered from\r\ntime to time. This procedure was fruitful in two principal results--the\r\neducation of the whole executive force in the technical details of\r\nthe system; and a constant improvement in the quality of the Edison\r\ninstallations; both contributing to the rapid growth of the industry.\r\n\r\nFor many years Goerck Street played an important part in Edison's\r\naffairs, being the centre of all his manufacture of heavy machinery. But\r\nit was not in a desirable neighborhood, and owing to the rapid growth of\r\nthe business soon became disadvantageous for other reasons. Edison tells\r\nof his frequent visits to the shops at night, with the escort of \"Jim\"\r\nRussell, a well-known detective, who knew all the denizens of the\r\nplace: \"We used to go out at night to a little, low place, an all-night\r\nhouse--eight feet wide and twenty-two feet long--where we got a lunch\r\nat two or three o'clock in the morning. It was the toughest kind of\r\nrestaurant ever seen. For the clam chowder they used the same four clams\r\nduring the whole season, and the average number of flies per pie was\r\nseven. This was by actual count.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the shops and the locality: \"The street was lined with rather old\r\nbuildings and poor tenements. We had not much frontage. As our business\r\nincreased enormously, our quarters became too small, so we saw the\r\ndistrict Tammany leader and asked him if we could not store castings\r\nand other things on the sidewalk. He gave us permission--told us to go\r\nahead, and he would see it was all right. The only thing he required for\r\nthis was that when a man was sent with a note from him asking us to\r\ngive him a job, he was to be put on. We had a hand-laborer foreman--'Big\r\nJim'--a very powerful Irishman, who could lift above half a ton. When\r\none of the Tammany aspirants appeared, he was told to go right to work\r\nat $1.50 per day. The next day he was told off to lift a certain piece,\r\nand if the man could not lift it he was discharged. That made the\r\nTammany man all safe. Jim could pick the piece up easily. The other man\r\ncould not, and so we let him out. Finally the Tammany leader called a\r\nhalt, as we were running big engine lathes out on the sidewalk, and he\r\nwas afraid we were carrying it a little too far. The lathes were worked\r\nright out in the street, and belted through the windows of the shop.\"\r\n\r\nAt last it became necessary to move from Goerck Street, and Mr. Edison\r\ngives a very interesting account of the incidents in connection with\r\nthe transfer of the plant to Schenectady, New York: \"After our works at\r\nGoerck Street got too small, we had labor troubles also. It seems I had\r\nrather a socialistic strain in me, and I raised the pay of the workmen\r\ntwenty-five cents an hour above the prevailing rate of wages, whereupon\r\nHoe & Company, our near neighbors, complained at our doing this. I said\r\nI thought it was all right. But the men, having got a little more\r\nwages, thought they would try coercion and get a little more, as we\r\nwere considered soft marks. Whereupon they struck at a time that\r\nwas critical. However, we were short of money for pay-rolls; and we\r\nconcluded it might not be so bad after all, as it would give us a\r\ncouple of weeks to catch up. So when the men went out they appointed a\r\ncommittee to meet us; but for two weeks they could not find us, so they\r\nbecame somewhat more anxious than we were. Finally they said they would\r\nlike to go back. We said all right, and back they went. It was quite a\r\nnovelty to the men not to be able to find us when they wanted to; and\r\nthey didn't relish it at all.\r\n\r\n\"What with these troubles and the lack of room, we decided to find\r\na factory elsewhere, and decided to try the locomotive works up at\r\nSchenectady. It seems that the people there had had a falling out among\r\nthemselves, and one of the directors had started opposition works; but\r\nbefore he had completed all the buildings and put in machinery some\r\ncompromise was made, and the works were for sale. We bought them very\r\nreasonably and moved everything there. These works were owned by me and\r\nmy assistants until sold to the Edison General Electric Company. At one\r\ntime we employed several thousand men; and since then the works have\r\nbeen greatly expanded.\r\n\r\n\"At these new works our orders were far in excess of our capital to\r\nhandle the business, and both Mr. Insull and I were afraid we might get\r\ninto trouble for lack of money. Mr. Insull was then my business manager,\r\nrunning the whole thing; and, therefore, when Mr. Henry Villard and his\r\nsyndicate offered to buy us out, we concluded it was better to be\r\nsure than be sorry; so we sold out for a large sum. Villard was a very\r\naggressive man with big ideas, but I could never quite understand him.\r\nHe had no sense of humor. I remember one time we were going up on the\r\nHudson River boat to inspect the works, and with us was Mr. Henderson,\r\nour chief engineer, who was certainly the best raconteur of funny\r\nstories I ever knew. We sat at the tail-end of the boat, and he started\r\nin to tell funny stories. Villard could not see a single point, and\r\nscarcely laughed at all; and Henderson became so disconcerted he had to\r\ngive it up. It was the same way with Gould. In the early telegraph days\r\nI remember going with him to see Mackay in 'The Impecunious Country\r\nEditor.' It was very funny, full of amusing and absurd situations; but\r\nGould never smiled once.\"\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Edison General Electric Company involved the\r\nconsolidation of the immediate Edison manufacturing interests in\r\nelectric light and power, with a capitalization of $12,000,000, now a\r\nrelatively modest sum; but in those days the amount was large, and\r\nthe combination caused a great deal of newspaper comment as to such\r\na coinage of brain power. The next step came with the creation of the\r\ngreat General Electric Company of to-day, a combination of the Edison,\r\nThomson-Houston, and Brush lighting interests in manufacture, which\r\nto this day maintains the ever-growing plants at Harrison, Lynn, and\r\nSchenectady, and there employs from twenty to twenty-five thousand\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EDISON CENTRAL STATION\r\n\r\nA NOTED inventor once said at the end of a lifetime of fighting to\r\ndefend his rights, that he found there were three stages in all great\r\ninventions: the first, in which people said the thing could not be done;\r\nthe second, in which they said anybody could do it; and the third,\r\nin which they said it had always been done by everybody. In his\r\ncentral-station work Edison has had very much this kind of experience;\r\nfor while many of his opponents came to acknowledge the novelty and\r\nutility of his plans, and gave him unstinted praise, there are doubtless\r\nothers who to this day profess to look upon him merely as an adapter.\r\nHow different the view of so eminent a scientist as Lord Kelvin was,\r\nmay be appreciated from his remark when in later years, in reply to the\r\nquestion why some one else did not invent so obvious and simple a thing\r\nas the Feeder System, he said: \"The only answer I can think of is that\r\nno one else was Edison.\"\r\n\r\nUndaunted by the attitude of doubt and the predictions of impossibility,\r\nEdison had pushed on until he was now able to realize all his ideas as\r\nto the establishment of a central station in the work that culminated\r\nin New York City in 1882. After he had conceived the broad plan, his\r\nambition was to create the initial plant on Manhattan Island, where it\r\nwould be convenient of access for watching its operation, and where the\r\ndemonstration of its practicability would have influence in financial\r\ncircles. The first intention was to cover a district extending from\r\nCanal Street on the north to Wall Street on the south; but Edison\r\nsoon realized that this territory was too extensive for the initial\r\nexperiment, and he decided finally upon the district included between\r\nWall, Nassau, Spruce, and Ferry streets, Peck Slip and the East River,\r\nan area nearly a square mile in extent. One of the preliminary steps\r\ntaken to enable him to figure on such a station and system was to have\r\nmen go through this district on various days and note the number of gas\r\njets burning at each hour up to two or three o'clock in the morning. The\r\nnext step was to divide the region into a number of sub-districts and\r\ninstitute a house-to-house canvass to ascertain precisely the data and\r\nconditions pertinent to the project. When the canvass was over, Edison\r\nknew exactly how many gas jets there were in every building in the\r\nentire district, the average hours of burning, and the cost of light;\r\nalso every consumer of power, and the quantity used; every hoistway to\r\nwhich an electric motor could be applied; and other details too numerous\r\nto mention, such as related to the gas itself, the satisfaction of\r\nthe customers, and the limitations of day and night demand. All this\r\ninformation was embodied graphically in large maps of the district, by\r\nannotations in colored inks; and Edison thus could study the question\r\nwith every detail before him. Such a reconnaissance, like that of a\r\ncoming field of battle, was invaluable, and may help give a further idea\r\nof the man's inveterate care for the minutiae of things.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory note-books of this period--1878-80, more\r\nparticularly--show an immense amount of calculation by Edison and his\r\nchief mathematician, Mr. Upton, on conductors for the distribution of\r\ncurrent over large areas, and then later in the district described.\r\nWith the results of this canvass before them, the sizes of the main\r\nconductors to be laid throughout the streets of this entire territory\r\nwere figured, block by block; and the results were then placed on the\r\nmap. These data revealed the fact that the quantity of copper required\r\nfor the main conductors would be exceedingly large and costly; and,\r\nif ever, Edison was somewhat dismayed. But as usual this apparently\r\ninsurmountable difficulty only spurred him on to further effort. It\r\nwas but a short time thereafter that he solved the knotty problem by an\r\ninvention mentioned in a previous chapter. This is known as the \"feeder\r\nand main\" system, for which he signed the application for a patent on\r\nAugust 4, 1880. As this invention effected a saving of seven-eighths of\r\nthe cost of the chief conductors in a straight multiple arc system, the\r\nmains for the first district were refigured, and enormous new maps were\r\nmade, which became the final basis of actual installation, as they were\r\nsubsequently enlarged by the addition of every proposed junction-box,\r\nbridge safety-catch box, and street-intersection box in the whole area.\r\n\r\nWhen this patent, after protracted fighting, was sustained by Judge\r\nGreen in 1893, the Electrical Engineer remarked that the General\r\nElectric Company \"must certainly feel elated\" because of its importance;\r\nand the journal expressed its fear that although the specifications and\r\nclaims related only to the maintenance of uniform pressure of current on\r\nlighting circuits, the owners might naturally seek to apply it also to\r\nfeeders used in the electric-railway work already so extensive. At this\r\ntime, however, the patent had only about a year of life left, owing\r\nto the expiration of the corresponding English patent. The fact that\r\nthirteen years had elapsed gives a vivid idea of the ordeal involved in\r\nsustaining a patent and the injustice to the inventor, while there is\r\nobviously hardship to those who cannot tell from any decision of the\r\ncourt whether they are infringing or not. It is interesting to note that\r\nthe preparation for hearing this case in New Jersey was accompanied by\r\nmodels to show the court exactly the method and its economy, as\r\nworked out in comparison with what is known as the \"tree system\"\r\nof circuits--the older alternative way of doing it. As a basis of\r\ncomparison, a district of thirty-six city blocks in the form of a square\r\nwas assumed. The power station was placed at the centre of the square;\r\neach block had sixteen consumers using fifteen lights each. Conductors\r\nwere run from the station to supply each of the four quarters of the\r\ndistrict with light. In one example the \"feeder\" system was used; in\r\nthe other the \"tree.\" With these models were shown two cubes which\r\nrepresented one one-hundredth of the actual quantity of copper required\r\nfor each quarter of the district by the two-wire tree system as compared\r\nwith the feeder system under like conditions. The total weight of copper\r\nfor the four quarter districts by the tree system was 803,250 pounds,\r\nbut when the feeder system was used it was only 128,739 pounds! This\r\nwas a reduction from $23.24 per lamp for copper to $3.72 per lamp. Other\r\nmodels emphasized this extraordinary contrast. At the time Edison was\r\ndoing this work on economizing in conductors, much of the criticism\r\nagainst him was based on the assumed extravagant use of copper implied\r\nin the obvious \"tree\" system, and it was very naturally said that there\r\nwas not enough copper in the world to supply his demands. It is true\r\nthat the modern electrical arts have been a great stimulator of copper\r\nproduction, now taking a quarter of all made; yet evidently but for such\r\ninventions as this such arts could not have come into existence at\r\nall, or else in growing up they would have forced copper to starvation\r\nprices. [11]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 11: For description of feeder patent see\r\n     Appendix.]\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that from the outset Edison had determined\r\nupon installing underground conductors as the only permanent and\r\nsatisfactory method for the distribution of current from central\r\nstations in cities; and that at Menlo Park he laid out and operated such\r\na system with about four hundred and twenty-five lamps. The underground\r\nsystem there was limited to the immediate vicinity of the laboratory and\r\nwas somewhat crude, as well as much less complicated than would be the\r\nnetwork of over eighty thousand lineal feet, which he calculated to be\r\nrequired for the underground circuits in the first district of New York\r\nCity. At Menlo Park no effort was made for permanency; no provision\r\nwas needed in regard to occasional openings of the street for various\r\npurposes; no new customers were to be connected from time to time to\r\nthe mains, and no repairs were within contemplation. In New York the\r\nquestion of permanency was of paramount importance, and the other\r\ncontingencies were sure to arise as well as conditions more easy\r\nto imagine than to forestall. These problems were all attacked in a\r\nresolute, thoroughgoing manner, and one by one solved by the invention\r\nof new and unprecedented devices that were adequate for the purposes of\r\nthe time, and which are embodied in apparatus of slight modification in\r\nuse up to the present day.\r\n\r\nJust what all this means it is hard for the present generation to\r\nimagine. New York and all the other great cities in 1882, and for\r\nsome years thereafter, were burdened and darkened by hideous masses\r\nof overhead wires carried on ugly wooden poles along all the main\r\nthoroughfares. One after another rival telegraph and telephone, stock\r\nticker, burglar-alarm, and other companies had strung their circuits\r\nwithout any supervision or restriction; and these wires in all\r\nconditions of sag or decay ramified and crisscrossed in every direction,\r\noften hanging broken and loose-ended for months, there being no official\r\ncompulsion to remove any dead wire. None of these circuits carried\r\ndangerous currents; but the introduction of the arc light brought an\r\nentirely new menace in the use of pressures that were even worse than\r\nthe bully of the West who \"kills on sight,\" because this kindred peril\r\nwas invisible, and might lurk anywhere. New poles were put up, and\r\nthe lighting circuits on them, with but a slight insulation of cotton\r\nimpregnated with some \"weather-proof\" compound, straggled all over the\r\ncity exposed to wind and rain and accidental contact with other wires,\r\nor with the metal of buildings. So many fatalities occurred that the\r\ninsulated wire used, called \"underwriters,\" because approved by the\r\ninsurance bodies, became jocularly known as \"undertakers,\" and efforts\r\nwere made to improve its protective qualities. Then came the overhead\r\ncircuits for distributing electrical energy to motors for operating\r\nelevators, driving machinery, etc., and these, while using a lower,\r\nsafer potential, were proportionately larger. There were no wires\r\nunderground. Morse had tried that at the very beginning of electrical\r\napplication, in telegraphy, and all agreed that renewals of the\r\nexperiment were at once costly and foolish. At last, in cities like\r\nNew York, what may be styled generically the \"overhead system\" of wires\r\nbroke down under its own weight; and various methods of underground\r\nconductors were tried, hastened in many places by the chopping down of\r\npoles and wires as the result of some accident that stirred the public\r\nindignation. One typical tragic scene was that in New York, where,\r\nwithin sight of the City Hall, a lineman was killed at his work on\r\nthe arc light pole, and his body slowly roasted before the gaze of the\r\nexcited populace, which for days afterward dropped its silver and copper\r\ncoin into the alms-box nailed to the fatal pole for the benefit of his\r\nfamily. Out of all this in New York came a board of electrical\r\ncontrol, a conduit system, and in the final analysis the Public\r\nService Commission, that is credited to Governor Hughes as the furthest\r\ndevelopment of utility corporation control.\r\n\r\nThe \"road to yesterday\" back to Edison and his insistence on underground\r\nwires is a long one, but the preceding paragraph traces it. Even\r\nadmitting that the size and weight of his low-tension conductors\r\nnecessitated putting them underground, this argues nothing against the\r\npropriety and sanity of his methods. He believed deeply and firmly in\r\nthe analogy between electrical supply and that for water and gas, and\r\npointed to the trite fact that nobody hoisted the water and gas mains\r\ninto the air on stilts, and that none of the pressures were inimical\r\nto human safety. The arc-lighting methods were unconsciously and\r\nunwittingly prophetic of the latter-day long-distance transmissions at\r\nhigh pressure that, electrically, have placed the energy of Niagara at\r\nthe command of Syracuse and Utica, and have put the power of the falling\r\nwaters of the Sierras at the disposal of San Francisco, two hundred\r\nmiles away. But within city limits overhead wires, with such\r\nspace-consuming potentials, are as fraught with mischievous peril to the\r\npublic as the dynamite stored by a nonchalant contractor in the cellar\r\nof a schoolhouse. As an offset, then, to any tendency to depreciate the\r\nintrinsic value of Edison's lighting work, let the claim be here set\r\nforth modestly and subject to interference, that he was the father of\r\nunderground wires in America, and by his example outlined the policy now\r\ndominant in every city of the first rank. Even the comment of a cynic\r\nin regard to electrical development may be accepted: \"Some electrical\r\ncompanies wanted all the air; others apparently had use for all the\r\nwater; Edison only asked for the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Jacob Hess, a famous New York Republican politician, was a\r\nmember of the commission appointed to put the wires underground in New\r\nYork City, in the \"eighties.\" He stated that when the commission was\r\nstruggling with the problem, and examining all kinds of devices and\r\nplans, patented and unpatented, for which fabulous sums were often\r\nasked, the body turned to Edison in its perplexity and asked for advice.\r\nEdison said: \"All you have to do, gentlemen, is to insulate your wires,\r\ndraw them through the cheapest thing on earth--iron pipe--run your pipes\r\nthrough channels or galleries under the street, and you've got the whole\r\nthing done.\" This was practically the system adopted and in use to\r\nthis day. What puzzled the old politician was that Edison would accept\r\nnothing for his advice.\r\n\r\nAnother story may also be interpolated here as to the underground work\r\ndone in New York for the first Edison station. It refers to the \"man\r\nhigher up,\" although the phrase had not been coined in those days\r\nof lower public morality. That a corporation should be \"held up\" was\r\naccepted philosophically by the corporation as one of the unavoidable\r\nincidents of its business; and if the corporation \"got back\" by securing\r\nsome privilege without paying for it, the public was ready to condone\r\nif not applaud. Public utilities were in the making, and no one in\r\nparticular had a keen sense of what was right or what was wrong, in\r\nthe hard, practical details of their development. Edison tells this\r\nilluminating story: \"When I was laying tubes in the streets of New York,\r\nthe office received notice from the Commissioner of Public Works to\r\nappear at his office at a certain hour. I went up there with a gentleman\r\nto see the Commissioner, H. O. Thompson. On arrival he said to me: 'You\r\nare putting down these tubes. The Department of Public Works requires\r\nthat you should have five inspectors to look after this work, and that\r\ntheir salary shall be $5 per day, payable at the end of each week.\r\nGood-morning.' I went out very much crestfallen, thinking I would be\r\ndelayed and harassed in the work which I was anxious to finish, and\r\nwas doing night and day. We watched patiently for those inspectors to\r\nappear. The only appearance they made was to draw their pay Saturday\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas in 1880--December 17--as an item for the silk\r\nstocking of Father Knickerbocker--the Edison Electric Illuminating\r\nCompany of New York was organized. In pursuance of the policy adhered\r\nto by Edison, a license was issued to it for the exclusive use of\r\nthe system in that territory--Manhattan Island--in consideration of a\r\ncertain sum of money and a fixed percentage of its capital in stock for\r\nthe patent rights. Early in 1881 it was altogether a paper enterprise,\r\nbut events moved swiftly as narrated already, and on June 25, 1881,\r\nthe first \"Jumbo\" prototype of the dynamo-electric machines to generate\r\ncurrent at the Pearl Street station was put through its paces before\r\nbeing shipped to Paris to furnish new sensations to the flaneur of the\r\nboulevards. A number of the Edison officers and employees assembled at\r\nGoerck Street to see this \"gigantic\" machine go into action, and watched\r\nits performance with due reverence all through the night until five\r\no'clock on Sunday morning, when it respected the conventionalities by\r\nbreaking a shaft and suspending further tests. After this dynamo was\r\nshipped to France, and its successors to England for the Holborn Viaduct\r\nplant, Edison made still further improvements in design, increasing\r\ncapacity and economy, and then proceeded vigorously with six machines\r\nfor Pearl Street.\r\n\r\nAn ideal location for any central station is at the very centre of the\r\ndistrict served. It may be questioned whether it often goes there. In\r\nthe New York first district the nearest property available was a double\r\nbuilding at Nos. 255 and 257 Pearl Street, occupying a lot so by 100\r\nfeet. It was four stories high, with a fire-wall dividing it into\r\ntwo equal parts. One of these parts was converted for the uses of the\r\nstation proper, and the other was used as a tube-shop by the underground\r\nconstruction department, as well as for repair-shops, storage, etc.\r\nThose were the days when no one built a new edifice for station\r\npurposes; that would have been deemed a fantastic extravagance. One\r\nearly station in New York for arc lighting was an old soap-works whose\r\nwell-soaked floors did not need much additional grease to render them\r\nchoice fuel for the inevitable flames. In this Pearl Street instance,\r\nthe building, erected originally for commercial uses, was quite\r\nincapable of sustaining the weight of the heavy dynamos and\r\nsteam-engines to be installed on the second floor; so the old flooring\r\nwas torn out and a new one of heavy girders supported by stiff columns\r\nwas substituted. This heavy construction, more familiar nowadays, and\r\nnot unlike the supporting metal structure of the Manhattan Elevated\r\nroad, was erected independent of the enclosing walls, and occupied the\r\nfull width of 257 Pearl Street, and about three-quarters of its depth.\r\nThis change in the internal arrangements did not at all affect the ugly\r\nexternal appearance, which did little to suggest the stately and\r\nornate stations since put up by the New York Edison Company, the latest\r\noccupying whole city blocks.\r\n\r\nOf this episode Edison gives the following account: \"While planning\r\nfor my first New York station--Pearl Street--of course, I had no real\r\nestate, and from lack of experience had very little knowledge of its\r\ncost in New York; so I assumed a rather large, liberal amount of it to\r\nplan my station on. It occurred to me one day that before I went too far\r\nwith my plans I had better find out what real estate was worth. In my\r\noriginal plan I had 200 by 200 feet. I thought that by going down on a\r\nslum street near the water-front I would get some pretty cheap property.\r\nSo I picked out the worst dilapidated street there was, and found I\r\ncould only get two buildings, each 25 feet front, one 100 feet deep and\r\nthe other 85 feet deep. I thought about $10,000 each would cover it;\r\nbut when I got the price I found that they wanted $75,000 for one and\r\n$80,000 for the other. Then I was compelled to change my plans and\r\ngo upward in the air where real estate was cheap. I cleared out the\r\nbuilding entirely to the walls and built my station of structural\r\nironwork, running it up high.\"\r\n\r\nInto this converted structure was put the most complete steam plant\r\nobtainable, together with all the mechanical and engineering adjuncts\r\nbearing upon economical and successful operation. Being in a narrow\r\nstreet and a congested district, the plant needed special facilities for\r\nthe handling of coal and ashes, as well as for ventilation and forced\r\ndraught. All of these details received Mr. Edison's personal care and\r\nconsideration on the spot, in addition to the multitude of other affairs\r\ndemanding his thought. Although not a steam or mechanical engineer, his\r\nquick grasp of principles and omnivorous reading had soon supplied the\r\nlack of training; nor had he forgotten the practical experience picked\r\nup as a boy on the locomotives of the Grand Trunk road. It is to\r\nbe noticed as a feature of the plant, in common with many of later\r\nconstruction, that it was placed well away from the water's edge,\r\nand equipped with non-condensing engines; whereas the modern plant\r\ninvariably seeks the bank of a river or lake for the purpose of a\r\ngenerous supply of water for its condensing engines or steam-turbines.\r\nThese are among the refinements of practice coincidental with the\r\nadvance of the art.\r\n\r\nAt the award of the John Fritz gold medal in April, 1909, to Charles T.\r\nPorter for his work in advancing the knowledge of steam-engineering, and\r\nfor improvements in engine construction, Mr. Frank J. Sprague spoke on\r\nbehalf of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers of the debt of\r\nelectricity to the high-speed steam-engine. He recalled the fact that\r\nat the French Exposition of 1867 Mr. Porter installed two Porter-Allen\r\nengines to drive electric alternating-current generators for supplying\r\ncurrent to primitive lighthouse apparatus. While the engines were not\r\ndirectly coupled to the dynamos, it was a curious fact that the piston\r\nspeeds and number of revolutions were what is common to-day in isolated\r\ndirect-coupled plants. In the dozen years following Mr. Porter built\r\nmany engines with certain common characteristics--i.e., high piston\r\nspeed and revolutions, solid engine bed, and babbitt-metal bearings; but\r\nthere was no electric driving until 1880, when Mr. Porter installed a\r\nhigh-speed engine for Edison at his laboratory in Menlo Park. Shortly\r\nafter this he was invited to construct for the Edison Pearl Street\r\nstation the first of a series of engines for so-called \"steam-dynamos,\"\r\neach independently driven by a direct-coupled engine. Mr. Sprague\r\ncompared the relations thus established between electricity and the\r\nhigh-speed engine not to those of debtor and creditor, but rather to\r\nthose of partners--an industrial marriage--one of the most important\r\nin the engineering world. Here were two machines destined to be joined\r\ntogether, economizing space, enhancing economy, augmenting capacity,\r\nreducing investment, and increasing dividends.\r\n\r\nWhile rapid progress was being made in this and other directions, the\r\nwheels of industry were humming merrily at the Edison Tube Works, for\r\nover fifteen miles of tube conductors were required for the district,\r\nbesides the boxes to connect the network at the street intersections,\r\nand the hundreds of junction boxes for taking the service conductors\r\ninto each of the hundreds of buildings. In addition to the immense\r\namount of money involved, this specialized industry required an enormous\r\namount of experiment, as it called for the development of an entirely\r\nnew art. But with Edison's inventive fertility--if ever there was a\r\ncross-fertilizer of mechanical ideas it is he--and with Mr. Kruesi's\r\nnever-failing patience and perseverance applied to experiment and\r\nevolution, rapid progress was made. A franchise having been obtained\r\nfrom the city, the work of laying the underground conductors began in\r\nthe late fall of 1881, and was pushed with almost frantic energy. It\r\nis not to be supposed, however, that the Edison tube system had then\r\nreached a finality of perfection in the eyes of its inventor. In his\r\ncorrespondence with Kruesi, as late as 1887, we find Edison bewailing\r\nthe inadequacy of the insulation of the conductors under twelve hundred\r\nvolts pressure, as for example: \"Dear Kruesi,--There is nothing wrong\r\nwith your present compound. It is splendid. The whole trouble is\r\nair-bubbles. The hotter it is poured the greater the amount of\r\nair-bubbles. At 212 it can be put on rods and there is no bubble. I have\r\na man experimenting and testing all the time. Until I get at the proper\r\nmethod of pouring and getting rid of the air-bubbles, it will be waste\r\nof time to experiment with other asphalts. Resin oil distils off easily.\r\nIt may answer, but paraffine or other similar substances must be put in\r\nto prevent brittleness, One thing is certain, and that is, everything\r\nmust be poured in layers, not only the boxes, but the tubes. The tube\r\nitself should have a thin coating. The rope should also have a coating.\r\nThe rods also. The whole lot, rods and rope, when ready for tube, should\r\nhave another coat, and then be placed in tube and filled. This will\r\ndo the business.\" Broad and large as a continent in his ideas, if ever\r\nthere was a man of finical fussiness in attention to detail, it\r\nis Edison. A letter of seven pages of about the same date in 1887\r\nexpatiates on the vicious troubles caused by the air-bubble, and remarks\r\nwith fine insight into the problems of insulation and the idea of layers\r\nof it: \"Thus you have three separate coatings, and it is impossible an\r\nair-hole in one should match the other.\"\r\n\r\nTo a man less thorough and empirical in method than Edison, it would\r\nhave been sufficient to have made his plans clear to associates or\r\nsubordinates and hold them responsible for accurate results. No such\r\nvicarious treatment would suit him, ready as he has always been to share\r\nthe work where he could give his trust. In fact he realized, as no\r\none else did at this stage, the tremendous import of this novel and\r\ncomprehensive scheme for giving the world light; and he would not let\r\ngo, even if busy to the breaking-point. Though plunged in a veritable\r\nmaelstrom of new and important business interests, and though applying\r\nfor no fewer than eighty-nine patents in 1881, all of which were\r\ngranted, he superintended on the spot all this laying of underground\r\nconductors for the first district. Nor did he merely stand around and\r\ngive orders. Day and night he actually worked in the trenches with the\r\nlaborers, amid the dirt and paving-stones and hurry-burly of traffic,\r\nhelping to lay the tubes, filling up junction-boxes, and taking part in\r\nall the infinite detail. He wanted to know for himself how things\r\nwent, why for some occult reason a little change was necessary, what\r\nimprovement could be made in the material. His hours of work were not\r\nregulated by the clock, but lasted until he felt the need of a little\r\nrest. Then he would go off to the station building in Pearl Street,\r\nthrow an overcoat on a pile of tubes, lie down and sleep for a few\r\nhours, rising to resume work with the first gang. There was a small\r\nbedroom on the third floor of the station available for him, but\r\ngoing to bed meant delay and consumed time. It is no wonder that such\r\nimpatience, such an enthusiasm, drove the work forward at a headlong\r\npace.\r\n\r\nEdison says of this period: \"When we put down the tubes in the lower\r\npart of New York, in the streets, we kept a big stock of them in the\r\ncellar of the station at Pearl Street. As I was on all the time, I would\r\ntake a nap of an hour or so in the daytime--any time--and I used to\r\nsleep on those tubes in the cellar. I had two Germans who were testing\r\nthere, and both of them died of diphtheria, caught in the cellar, which\r\nwas cold and damp. It never affected me.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth pausing just a moment to glance at this man taking a fitful\r\nrest on a pile of iron pipe in a dingy building. His name is on the\r\ntip of the world's tongue. Distinguished scientists from every part of\r\nEurope seek him eagerly. He has just been decorated and awarded high\r\nhonors by the French Government. He is the inventor of wonderful new\r\napparatus, and the exploiter of novel and successful arts. The magic of\r\nhis achievements and the rumors of what is being done have caused a wild\r\ndrop in gas securities, and a sensational rise in his own electric-light\r\nstock from $100 to $3500 a share. Yet these things do not at all affect\r\nhis slumber or his democratic simplicity, for in that, as in everything\r\nelse, he is attending strictly to business, \"doing the thing that is\r\nnext to him.\"\r\n\r\nPart of the rush and feverish haste was due to the approach of frost,\r\nwhich, as usual in New York, suspended operations in the earth; but the\r\nlaying of the conductors was resumed promptly in the spring of 1882; and\r\nmeantime other work had been advanced. During the fall and winter months\r\ntwo more \"Jumbo\" dynamos were built and sent to London, after which the\r\nconstruction of six for New York was swiftly taken in hand. In the month\r\nof May three of these machines, each with a capacity of twelve hundred\r\nincandescent lamps, were delivered at Pearl Street and assembled on the\r\nsecond floor. On July 5th--owing to the better opportunity for ceaseless\r\ntoil given by a public holiday--the construction of the operative part\r\nof the station was so far completed that the first of the dynamos\r\nwas operated under steam; so that three days later the satisfactory\r\nexperiment was made of throwing its flood of electrical energy into a\r\nbank of one thousand lamps on an upper floor. Other tests followed in\r\ndue course. All was excitement. The field-regulating apparatus and the\r\nelectrical-pressure indicator--first of its kind--were also tested,\r\nand in turn found satisfactory. Another vital test was made at this\r\ntime--namely, of the strength of the iron structure itself on which the\r\nplant was erected. This was done by two structural experts; and not till\r\nhe got their report as to ample factors of safety was Edison reassured\r\nas to this detail.\r\n\r\nA remark of Edison, familiar to all who have worked with him, when it\r\nis reported to him that something new goes all right and is satisfactory\r\nfrom all points of view, is: \"Well, boys, now let's find the bugs,\"\r\nand the hunt for the phylloxera begins with fiendish, remorseless zest.\r\nBefore starting the plant for regular commercial service, he began\r\npersonally a series of practical experiments and tests to ascertain in\r\nadvance what difficulties would actually arise in practice, so that he\r\ncould provide remedies or preventives. He had several cots placed in the\r\nadjoining building, and he and a few of his most strenuous assistants\r\nworked day and night, leaving the work only for hurried meals and a\r\nsnatch of sleep. These crucial tests, aiming virtually to break the\r\nplant down if possible within predetermined conditions, lasted several\r\nweeks, and while most valuable in the information they afforded, did\r\nnot hinder anything, for meantime customers' premises throughout the\r\ndistrict were being wired and supplied with lamps and meters.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, September 4, 1882, at 3 o'clock, P.M., Edison realized the\r\nconsummation of his broad and original scheme. The Pearl Street station\r\nwas officially started by admitting steam to the engine of one of the\r\n\"Jumbos,\" current was generated, turned into the network of underground\r\nconductors, and was transformed into light by the incandescent lamps\r\nthat had thus far been installed. This date and event may properly be\r\nregarded as historical, for they mark the practical beginning of a new\r\nart, which in the intervening years has grown prodigiously, and is still\r\nincreasing by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nEverything worked satisfactorily in the main. There were a few\r\nmechanical and engineering annoyances that might naturally be expected\r\nto arise in a new and unprecedented enterprise; but nothing of\r\nsufficient moment to interfere with the steady and continuous supply\r\nof current to customers at all hours of the day and night. Indeed, once\r\nstarted, this station was operated uninterruptedly for eight years with\r\nonly insignificant stoppage.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noted by the reader that there was nothing to indicate\r\nrashness in starting up the station, as only one dynamo was put in\r\noperation. Within a short time, however, it was deemed desirable to\r\nsupply the underground network with more current, as many additional\r\ncustomers had been connected and the demand for the new light was\r\nincreasing very rapidly. Although Edison had successfully operated\r\nseveral dynamos in multiple arc two years before--i.e., all feeding\r\ncurrent together into the same circuits--there was not, at this early\r\nperiod of experience, any absolute certainty as to what particular\r\nresults might occur upon the throwing of the current from two or more\r\nsuch massive dynamos into a great distributing system. The sequel\r\nshowed the value of Edison's cautious method in starting the station by\r\noperating only a single unit at first.\r\n\r\nHe decided that it would be wise to make the trial operation of a second\r\n\"Jumbo\" on a Sunday, when business houses were closed in the district,\r\nthus obviating any danger of false impressions in the public mind in the\r\nevent of any extraordinary manifestations. The circumstances attending\r\nthe adding of a second dynamo are thus humorously described by Edison:\r\n\"My heart was in my mouth at first, but everything worked all right....\r\nThen we started another engine and threw them in parallel. Of all the\r\ncircuses since Adam was born, we had the worst then! One engine would\r\nstop, and the other would run up to about a thousand revolutions, and\r\nthen they would see-saw. The trouble was with the governors. When\r\nthe circus commenced, the gang that was standing around ran out\r\nprecipitately, and I guess some of them kept running for a block or two.\r\nI grabbed the throttle of one engine, and E. H. Johnson, who was the\r\nonly one present to keep his wits, caught hold of the other, and we shut\r\nthem off.\" One of the \"gang\" that ran, but, in this case, only to\r\nthe end of the room, afterward said: \"At the time it was a terrifying\r\nexperience, as I didn't know what was going to happen. The engines and\r\ndynamos made a horrible racket, from loud and deep groans to a hideous\r\nshriek, and the place seemed to be filled with sparks and flames of all\r\ncolors. It was as if the gates of the infernal regions had been suddenly\r\nopened.\"\r\n\r\nThis trouble was at once attacked by Edison in his characteristic and\r\nstrenuous way. The above experiment took place between three and four\r\no'clock on a Sunday afternoon, and within a few hours he had gathered\r\nhis superintendent and men of the machine-works and had them at work on\r\na shafting device that he thought would remedy the trouble. He says: \"Of\r\ncourse, I discovered that what had happened was that one set was running\r\nthe other as a motor. I then put up a long shaft, connecting all the\r\ngovernors together, and thought this would certainly cure the trouble;\r\nbut it didn't. The torsion of the shaft was so great that one governor\r\nstill managed to get ahead of the others. Well, it was a serious state\r\nof things, and I worried over it a lot. Finally I went down to Goerck\r\nStreet and got a piece of shafting and a tube in which it fitted. I\r\ntwisted the shafting one way and the tube the other as far as I could,\r\nand pinned them together. In this way, by straining the whole outfit up\r\nto its elastic limit in opposite directions, the torsion was practically\r\neliminated, and after that the governors ran together all right.\"\r\n\r\nEdison realized, however, that in commercial practice this was only a\r\ntemporary expedient, and that a satisfactory permanence of results could\r\nonly be attained with more perfect engines that could be depended upon\r\nfor close and simple regulation. The engines that were made part of the\r\nfirst three \"Jumbos\" placed in the station were the very best that could\r\nbe obtained at the time, and even then had been specially designed and\r\nbuilt for the purpose. Once more quoting Edison on this subject: \"About\r\nthat time\" (when he was trying to run several dynamos in parallel in the\r\nPearl Street station) \"I got hold of Gardiner C. Sims, and he undertook\r\nto build an engine to run at three hundred and fifty revolutions\r\nand give one hundred and seventy-five horse-power. He went back to\r\nProvidence and set to work, and brought the engine back with him to the\r\nshop. It worked only a few minutes when it busted. That man sat around\r\nthat shop and slept in it for three weeks, until he got his engine right\r\nand made it work the way he wanted it to. When he reached this period\r\nI gave orders for the engine-works to run night and day until we got\r\nenough engines, and when all was ready we started the engines. Then\r\neverything worked all right.... One of these engines that Sims built ran\r\ntwenty-four hours a day, three hundred and sixty-five days in the year,\r\nfor over a year before it stopped.\" [12]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 12: We quote the following interesting notes of\r\n     Mr. Charles L. Clarke on the question of see-sawing, or\r\n     \"hunting,\" as it was afterward termed:\r\n\r\n\"In the Holborn Viaduct station the difficulty of 'hunting' was not\r\nexperienced. At the time the 'Jumbos' were first operated in multiple\r\narc, April 8, 1882, one machine was driven by a Porter-Allen engine,\r\nand the other by an Armington & Sims engine, and both machines were on\r\na solid foundation. At the station at Milan, Italy, the first 'Jumbos'\r\noperated in multiple arc were driven by Porter-Allen engines, and\r\ndash-pots were applied to the governors. These machines were also upon a\r\nsolid foundation, and no trouble was experienced.\r\n\r\n\"At the Pearl Street station, however, the machines were supported upon\r\nlong iron floor-beams, and at the high speed of 350 revolutions per\r\nminute, considerable vertical vibration was given to the engines. And\r\nthe writer is inclined to the opinion that this vibration, acting in the\r\nsame direction as the action of gravitation, which was one of the two\r\ncontrolling forces in the operation of the Porter-Allen governor, was\r\nthe primary cause of the 'hunting.' In the Armington & Sims engine the\r\ncontrolling forces in the operation of the governor were the centrifugal\r\nforce of revolving weights, and the opposing force of compressed\r\nsprings, and neither the action of gravitation nor the vertical\r\nvibrations of the engine could have any sensible effect upon the\r\ngovernor.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Pearl Street station, as this first large plant was called, made\r\nrapid and continuous growth in its output of electric current. It\r\nstarted, as we have said, on September 4, 1882, supplying about four\r\nhundred lights to a comparatively small number of customers. Among those\r\nfirst supplied was the banking firm of Drexel, Morgan & Company, corner\r\nof Broad and Wall streets, at the outermost limits of the system. Before\r\nthe end of December of the same year the light had so grown in favor\r\nthat it was being supplied to over two hundred and forty customers whose\r\nbuildings were wired for over five thousand lamps. By this time three\r\nmore \"Jumbos\" had been added to the plant. The output from this time\r\nforward increased steadily up to the spring of 1884, when the demands of\r\nthe station necessitated the installation of two additional \"Jumbos\"\r\nin the adjoining building, which, with the venous improvements that had\r\nbeen made in the mean time, gave the station a capacity of over eleven\r\nthousand lamps actually in service at any one time.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three months of operating the Pearl Street station\r\nlight was supplied to customers without charge. Edison had perfect\r\nconfidence in his meters, and also in the ultimate judgment of the\r\npublic as to the superiority of the incandescent electric light as\r\nagainst other illuminants. He realized, however, that in the beginning\r\nof the operation of an entirely novel plant there was ample opportunity\r\nfor unexpected contingencies, although the greatest care had been\r\nexercised to make everything as perfect as possible. Mechanical defects\r\nor other unforeseen troubles in any part of the plant or underground\r\nsystem might arise and cause temporary stoppages of operation, thus\r\ngiving grounds for uncertainty which would create a feeling of public\r\ndistrust in the permanence of the supply of light.\r\n\r\nAs to the kind of mishap that was wont to occur, Edison tells the\r\nfollowing story: \"One afternoon, after our Pearl Street station started,\r\na policeman rushed in and told us to send an electrician at once up to\r\nthe corner of Ann and Nassau streets--some trouble. Another man and\r\nI went up. We found an immense crowd of men and boys there and in\r\nthe adjoining streets--a perfect jam. There was a leak in one of our\r\njunction-boxes, and on account of the cellars extending under the\r\nstreet, the top soil had become insulated. Hence, by means of this leak\r\npowerful currents were passing through this thin layer of moist earth.\r\nWhen a horse went to pass over it he would get a very severe shock. When\r\nI arrived I saw coming along the street a ragman with a dilapidated old\r\nhorse, and one of the boys told him to go over on the other side of\r\nthe road--which was the place where the current leaked. When the ragman\r\nheard this he took that side at once. The moment the horse struck the\r\nelectrified soil he stood straight up in the air, and then reared again;\r\nand the crowd yelled, the policeman yelled; and the horse started to run\r\naway. This continued until the crowd got so serious that the policeman\r\nhad to clear it out; and we were notified to cut the current off. We got\r\na gang of men, cut the current off for several junction-boxes, and fixed\r\nthe leak. One man who had seen it came to me next day and wanted me to\r\nput in apparatus for him at a place where they sold horses. He said he\r\ncould make a fortune with it, because he could get old nags in there and\r\nmake them act like thoroughbreds.\"\r\n\r\nSo well had the work been planned and executed, however, that nothing\r\nhappened to hinder the continuous working of the station and the supply\r\nof light to customers. Hence it was decided in December, 1882, to begin\r\ncharging a price for the service, and, accordingly, Edison electrolytic\r\nmeters were installed on the premises of each customer then connected.\r\nThe first bill for lighting, based upon the reading of one of these\r\nmeters, amounted to $50.40, and was collected on January 18, 1883, from\r\nthe Ansonia Brass and Copper Company, 17 and 19 Cliff Street. Generally\r\nspeaking, customers found that their bills compared fairly with gas\r\nbills for corresponding months where the same amount of light was used,\r\nand they paid promptly and cheerfully, with emphatic encomiums of the\r\nnew light. During November, 1883, a little over one year after the\r\nstation was started, bills for lighting amounting to over $9000 were\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nAn interesting story of meter experience in the first few months of\r\noperation of the Pearl Street station is told by one of the \"boys\" who\r\nwas then in position to know the facts; \"Mr. J. P. Morgan, whose firm\r\nwas one of the first customers, expressed to Mr. Edison some doubt as\r\nto the accuracy of the meter. The latter, firmly convinced of its\r\ncorrectness, suggested a strict test by having some cards printed and\r\nhung on each fixture at Mr. Morgan's place. On these cards was to be\r\nnoted the number of lamps in the fixture, and the time they were turned\r\non and off each day for a month. At the end of that time the lamp-hours\r\nwere to be added together by one of the clerks and figured on a basis of\r\na definite amount per lamp-hour, and compared with the bill that would\r\nbe rendered by the station for the corresponding period. The results\r\nof the first month's test showed an apparent overcharge by the Edison\r\ncompany. Mr. Morgan was exultant, while Mr. Edison was still confident\r\nand suggested a continuation of the test. Another month's trial showed\r\nsomewhat similar results. Mr. Edison was a little disturbed, but\r\ninsisted that there was a mistake somewhere. He went down to Drexel,\r\nMorgan & Company's office to investigate, and, after looking around,\r\nasked when the office was cleaned out. He was told it was done at night\r\nby the janitor, who was sent for, and upon being interrogated as to what\r\nlight he used, said that he turned on a central fixture containing about\r\nten lights. It came out that he had made no record of the time these\r\nlights were in use. He was told to do so in future, and another month's\r\ntest was made. On comparison with the company's bill, rendered on the\r\nmeter-reading, the meter came within a few cents of the amount computed\r\nfrom the card records, and Mr. Morgan was completely satisfied of the\r\naccuracy of the meter.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a strange but not extraordinary commentary on the perversity of\r\nhuman nature and the lack of correct observation, to note that even\r\nafter the Pearl Street station had been in actual operation twenty-four\r\nhours a day for nearly three months, there should still remain an\r\nattitude of \"can't be done.\" That such a scepticism still obtained is\r\nevidenced by the public prints of the period. Edison's electric-light\r\nsystem and his broad claims were freely discussed and animadverted upon\r\nat the very time he was demonstrating their successful application. To\r\nshow some of the feeling at the time, we reproduce the following letter,\r\nwhich appeared November 29, 1882:\r\n\r\n\"To the Editor of the Sun:\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--In reading the discussions relative to the Pearl Street station\r\nof the Edison light, I have noted that while it is claimed that there\r\nis scarcely any loss from leakage of current, nothing is said about the\r\nloss due to the resistance of the long circuits. I am informed that this\r\nis the secret of the failure to produce with the power in position a\r\nsufficient amount of current to run all the lamps that have been put\r\nup, and that while six, and even seven, lights to the horse-power may be\r\nproduced from an isolated plant, the resistance of the long underground\r\nwires reduces this result in the above case to less than three lights to\r\nthe horse-power, thus making the cost of production greatly in excess of\r\ngas. Can the Edison company explain this? 'INVESTIGATOR'.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of the many anonymous letters that had been written to the\r\nnewspapers on the subject, and the following reply by the Edison company\r\nwas printed December 3, 1882:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To the Editor of the Sun:\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--'Investigator' in Wednesday's Sun, says that the Edison company\r\nis troubled at its Pearl Street station with a 'loss of current, due\r\nto the resistance of the long circuits'; also that, whereas Edison gets\r\n'six or even seven lights to the horse-power in isolated plants, the\r\nresistance of the long underground wires reduces that result in the\r\nPearl Street station to less than three lights to the horse-power.' Both\r\nof these statements are false. As regards loss due to resistance, there\r\nis a well-known law for determining it, based on Ohm's law. By use of\r\nthat law we knew in advance, that is to say, when the original plans for\r\nthe station were drawn, just what this loss would be, precisely the same\r\nas a mechanical engineer when constructing a mill with long lines of\r\nshafting can forecast the loss of power due to friction. The practical\r\nresult in the Pearl Street station has fully demonstrated the\r\ncorrectness of our estimate thus made in advance. As regards our getting\r\nonly three lights per horse-power, our station has now been running\r\nthree months, without stopping a moment, day or night, and we invariably\r\nget over six lamps per horse-power, or substantially the same as we do\r\nin our isolated plants. We are now lighting one hundred and ninety-three\r\nbuildings, wired for forty-four hundred lamps, of which about two-thirds\r\nare in constant use, and we are adding additional houses and lamps\r\ndaily. These figures can be verified at the office of the Board of\r\nUnderwriters, where certificates with full details permitting the use of\r\nour light are filed by their own inspector. To light these lamps we run\r\nfrom one to three dynamos, according to the lamps in use at any given\r\ntime, and we shall start additional dynamos as fast as we can connect\r\nmore buildings. Neither as regards the loss due to resistance, nor as\r\nregards the number of lamps per horse-power, is there the slightest\r\ntrouble or disappointment on the part of our company, and your\r\ncorrespondent is entirely in error is assuming that there is. Let me\r\nsuggest that if 'Investigator' really wishes to investigate, and is\r\ncompetent and willing to learn the exact facts, he can do so at this\r\noffice, where there is no mystery of concealment, but, on the contrary,\r\na strong desire to communicate facts to intelligent inquirers. Such\r\na method of investigating must certainly be more satisfactory to one\r\nhonestly seeking knowledge than that of first assuming an error as the\r\nbasis of a question, and then demanding an explanation.\r\n\r\n\"Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n\"S. B. EATON, President.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nViewed from the standpoint of over twenty-seven years later, the wisdom\r\nand necessity of answering anonymous newspaper letters of this kind\r\nmight be deemed questionable, but it must be remembered that, although\r\nthe Pearl Street station was working successfully, and Edison's\r\ncomprehensive plans were abundantly vindicated, the enterprise\r\nwas absolutely new and only just stepping on the very threshold of\r\ncommercial exploitation. To enter in and possess the land required the\r\nconfidence of capital and the general public. Hence it was necessary to\r\nmaintain a constant vigilance to defeat the insidious attacks of carping\r\ncritics and others who would attempt to injure the Edison system by\r\nmisleading statements.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to the modern electrician to note that when this\r\npioneer station was started, and in fact for some little time afterward,\r\nthere was not a single electrical instrument in the whole station--not\r\na voltmeter or an ammeter! Nor was there a central switchboard! Each\r\ndynamo had its own individual control switch. The feeder connections\r\nwere all at the front of the building, and the general voltage control\r\napparatus was on the floor above. An automatic pressure indicator had\r\nbeen devised and put in connection with the main circuits. It consisted,\r\ngenerally speaking, of an electromagnet with relays connecting with a\r\nred and a blue lamp. When the electrical pressure was normal,\r\nneither lamp was lighted; but if the electromotive force rose above a\r\npredetermined amount by one or two volts, the red lamp lighted up,\r\nand the attendant at the hand-wheel of the field regulator inserted\r\nresistance in the field circuit, whereas, if the blue lamp lighted,\r\nresistance was cut out until the pressure was raised to normal. Later on\r\nthis primitive indicator was supplanted by the \"Bradley Bridge,\" a crude\r\nform of the \"Howell\" pressure indicators, which were subsequently used\r\nfor many years in the Edison stations.\r\n\r\nMuch could be added to make a complete pictorial description of the\r\nhistoric Pearl Street station, but it is not within the scope of this\r\nnarrative to enter into diffuse technical details, interesting as they\r\nmay be to many persons. We cannot close this chapter, however, without\r\nmention of the fate of the Pearl Street station, which continued in\r\nsuccessful commercial operation until January 2, 1890, when it was\r\npartially destroyed by fire. All the \"Jumbos\" were ruined, excepting No.\r\n9, which is still a venerated relic in the possession of the New\r\nYork Edison Company. Luckily, the boilers were unharmed. Belt-driven\r\ngenerators and engines were speedily installed, and the station was\r\nagain in operation in a few days. The uninjured \"Jumbo,\" No. 9, again\r\ncontinued to perform its duty. But in the words of Mr. Charles L.\r\nClarke, \"the glory of the old Pearl Street station, unique in bearing\r\nthe impress of Mr. Edison's personality, and, as it were, constructed\r\nwith his own hands, disappeared in the flame and smoke of that Thursday\r\nmorning fire.\"\r\n\r\nThe few days' interruption of the service was the only serious one\r\nthat has taken place in the history of the New York Edison Company from\r\nSeptember 4, 1882, to the present date. The Pearl Street station was\r\noperated for some time subsequent to the fire, but increasing demands\r\nin the mean time having led to the construction of other stations, the\r\nmains of the First District were soon afterward connected to another\r\nplant, the Pearl Street station was dismantled, and the building was\r\nsold in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe prophetic insight into the magnitude of central-station lighting\r\nthat Edison had when he was still experimenting on the incandescent lamp\r\nover thirty years ago is a little less than astounding, when it is so\r\namply verified in the operations of the New York Edison Company (the\r\nsuccessor of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of New York) and\r\nmany others. At the end of 1909 the New York Edison Company alone was\r\noperating twenty-eight stations and substations, having a total capacity\r\nof 159,500 kilowatts. Connected with its lines were approximately 85,000\r\ncustomers wired for 3,813,899 incandescent lamps and nearly 225,000\r\nhorse-power through industrial electric motors connected with the\r\nunderground service. A large quantity of electrical energy is also\r\nsupplied for heating and cooking, charging automobiles, chemical and\r\nplating work, and various other uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nOTHER EARLY STATIONS--THE METER\r\n\r\nWE have now seen the Edison lighting system given a complete, convincing\r\ndemonstration in Paris, London, and New York; and have noted steps taken\r\nfor its introduction elsewhere on both sides of the Atlantic. The Paris\r\nplant, like that at the Crystal Palace, was a temporary exhibit. The\r\nLondon plant was less temporary, but not permanent, supplying before\r\nit was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels, churches,\r\nstores, and dwellings in the vicinity of Holborn Viaduct. There Messrs.\r\nJohnson and Hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in\r\nthe art, and secured much useful data for the work in New York, of which\r\nthe story has just been told.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the first Edison commercial station to be operated\r\nin this country was that at Appleton, Wisconsin, but its only serious\r\nclaim to notice is that it was the initial one of the system driven by\r\nwater-power. It went into service August 15, 1882, about three weeks\r\nbefore the Pearl Street station. It consisted of one small dynamo of\r\na capacity of two hundred and eighty lights of 10 c.p. each, and was\r\nhoused in an unpretentious wooden shed. The dynamo-electric machine,\r\nthough small, was robust, for under all the varying speeds of\r\nwater-power, and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it, belonged, it\r\ncontinued in active use until 1899--seventeen years.\r\n\r\nEdison was from the first deeply impressed with the possibilities of\r\nwater-power, and, as this incident shows, was prompt to seize such a\r\nvery early opportunity. But his attention was in reality concentrated\r\nclosely on the supply of great centres of population, a task which\r\nhe then felt might well occupy his lifetime; and except in regard to\r\nfurnishing isolated plants he did not pursue further the development of\r\nhydro-electric stations. That was left to others, and to the application\r\nof the alternating current, which has enabled engineers to harness\r\nremote powers, and, within thoroughly economical limits, transmit\r\nthousands of horse-power as much as two hundred miles at pressures\r\nof 80,000 and 100,000 volts. Owing to his insistence on low pressure,\r\ndirect current for use in densely populated districts, as the only safe\r\nand truly universal, profitable way of delivering electrical energy to\r\nthe consumers, Edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent\r\nof the alternating current. This does him an injustice. At the time\r\na measure was before the Virginia legislature, in 1890, to limit the\r\npermissible pressures of current so as to render it safe, he said: \"You\r\nwant to allow high pressure wherever the conditions are such that by\r\nno possible accident could that pressure get into the houses of\r\nthe consumers; you want to give them all the latitude you can.\" In\r\nexplaining this he added: \"Suppose you want to take the falls down at\r\nRichmond, and want to put up a water-power? Why, if we erect a station\r\nat the falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city. By digging\r\na cheap trench and putting in an insulated cable, and connecting such\r\nstation with the central part of Richmond, having the end of the cable\r\ncome up into the station from the earth and there connected with motors,\r\nthe power of the falls would be transmitted to these motors. If now the\r\nmotors were made to run dynamos conveying low-pressure currents to the\r\npublic, there is no possible way whereby this high-pressure current\r\ncould get to the public.\" In other words, Edison made the sharp\r\nfundamental distinction between high pressure alternating current for\r\ntransmission and low pressure direct current for distribution; and this\r\nis exactly the practice that has been adopted in all the great cities\r\nof the country to-day. There seems no good reason for believing that it\r\nwill change. It might perhaps have been altogether better for Edison,\r\nfrom the financial standpoint, if he had not identified himself so\r\ncompletely with one kind of current, but that made no difference to him,\r\nas it was a matter of conviction; and Edison's convictions are granitic.\r\nMoreover, this controversy over the two currents, alternating and\r\ndirect, which has become historical in the field of electricity--and\r\nis something like the \"irrepressible conflict\" we heard of years ago\r\nin national affairs--illustrates another aspect of Edison's character.\r\nBroad as the prairies and free in thought as the winds that sweep them,\r\nhe is idiosyncratically opposed to loose and wasteful methods, to plans\r\nof empire that neglect the poor at the gate. Everything he has done has\r\nbeen aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space,\r\nthe intensification of culture. Burbank and his tribe represent in the\r\nvegetable world, Edison in the mechanical. Not only has he developed\r\ndistinctly new species, but he has elucidated the intensive art of\r\ngetting $1200 out of an electrical acre instead of $12--a manured\r\nmarket-garden inside London and a ten-bushel exhausted wheat farm\r\noutside Lawrence, Kansas, being the antipodes of productivity--yet very\r\nfar short of exemplifying the difference of electrical yield between an\r\nacre of territory in Edison's \"first New York district\" and an acre in\r\nsome small town.\r\n\r\nEdison's lighting work furnished an excellent basis--in fact, the only\r\none--for the development of the alternating current now so generally\r\nemployed in central-station work in America; and in the McGraw\r\nElectrical Directory of April, 1909, no fewer than 4164 stations out of\r\n5780 reported its use. When the alternating current was introduced for\r\npractical purposes it was not needed for arc lighting, the circuit for\r\nwhich, from a single dynamo, would often be twenty or thirty miles\r\nin length, its current having a pressure of not less than five or six\r\nthousand volts. For some years it was not found feasible to operate\r\nmotors on alternating-current circuits, and that reason was often\r\nurged against it seriously. It could not be used for electroplating\r\nor deposition, nor could it charge storage batteries, all of which are\r\neasily within the ability of the direct current. But when it came to be\r\na question of lighting a scattered suburb, a group of dwellings on the\r\noutskirts, a remote country residence or a farm-house, the alternating\r\ncurrent, in all elements save its danger, was and is ideal. Its thin\r\nwires can be carried cheaply over vast areas, and at each local point\r\nof consumption the transformer of size exactly proportioned to its\r\nlocal task takes the high-voltage transmission current and lowers its\r\npotential at a ratio of 20 or 40 to 1, for use in distribution and\r\nconsumption circuits. This evolution has been quite distinct, with its\r\nown inventors like Gaulard and Gibbs and Stanley, but came subsequent\r\nto the work of supplying small, dense areas of population; the art thus\r\ngrowing from within, and using each new gain as a means for further\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nNor was the effect of such great advances as those made by Edison\r\nlimited to the electrical field. Every department of mechanics was\r\nstimulated and benefited to an extraordinary degree. Copper for the\r\ncircuits was more highly refined than ever before to secure the best\r\nconductivity, and purity was insisted on in every kind of insulation.\r\nEdison was intolerant of sham and shoddy, and nothing would satisfy him\r\nthat could not stand cross-examination by microscope, test-tube, and\r\ngalvanometer. It was, perhaps, the steam-engine on which the deepest\r\nimprint for good was made, referred to already in the remarks of Mr.\r\nF. J. Sprague in the preceding chapter, but best illustrated in the\r\nperfection of the modern high-speed engine of the Armington & Sims type.\r\nUnless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly\r\ngoverned and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp,\r\nEdison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady\r\nlight. He did not want his customers to count the heart-beats of the\r\nengine in the flicker of the lamp. Not a single engine was even within\r\ngunshot of the standard thus set up, but the emergency called forth its\r\nman in Gardiner C. Sims, a talented draughtsman and designer who\r\nhad been engaged in locomotive construction and in the engineering\r\ndepartment of the United States Navy. He may be quoted as to what\r\nhappened: \"The deep interest, financial and moral, and friendly backing\r\nI received from Mr. Edison, together with valuable suggestions, enabled\r\nme to bring out the engine; as I was quite alone in the world--poor--I\r\nhad found a friend who knew what he wanted and explained it clearly. Mr.\r\nEdison was a leader far ahead of the time. He compelled the design of\r\nthe successful engine.\r\n\r\n\"Our first engine compelled the inventing and making of a suitable\r\nengine indicator to indicate it--the Tabor. He obtained the desired\r\nspeed and load with a friction brake; also regulator of speed; but\r\nwaited for an indicator to verify it. Then again there was no known way\r\nto lubricate an engine for continuous running, and Mr. Edison informed\r\nme that as a marine engine started before the ship left New York and\r\ncontinued running until it reached its home port, so an engine for his\r\npurposes must produce light at all times. That was a poser to me, for a\r\nfive-hours' run was about all that had been required up to that time.\r\n\r\n\"A day or two later Mr. Edison inquired: 'How far is it from here to\r\nLawrence; it is a long walk, isn't it?' 'Yes, rather.' He said: 'Of\r\ncourse you will understand I meant without oil.' To say I was deeply\r\nperplexed does not express my feelings. We were at the machine works,\r\nGoerck Street. I started for the oil-room, when, about entering, I saw a\r\nsmall funnel lying on the floor. It had been stepped on and flattened. I\r\ntook it up, and it had solved the engine-oiling problem--and my walk to\r\nLawrence like a tramp actor's was off! The eccentric strap had a round\r\nglass oil-cup with a brass base that screwed into the strap. I took it\r\noff, and making a sketch, went to Dave Cunningham, having the funnel\r\nin my hand to illustrate what I wanted made. I requested him to make a\r\nsheet-brass oil-cup and solder it to the base I had. He did so. I then\r\nhad a standard made to hold another oil-cup, so as to see and regulate\r\nthe drop-feed. On this combination I obtained a patent which is now\r\nuniversally used.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that in due course the engine builders of\r\nthe United States developed a variety of excellent prime movers for\r\nelectric-light and power plants, and were grateful to the art from which\r\nsuch a stimulus came to their industry; but for many years one never saw\r\nan Edison installation without expecting to find one or more Armington\r\n& Sims high-speed engines part of it. Though the type has gone out of\r\nexistence, like so many other things that are useful in their day and\r\ngeneration, it was once a very vital part of the art, and one more\r\nillustration of that intimate manner in which the advances in different\r\nfields of progress interact and co-operate.\r\n\r\nEdison had installed his historic first great central-station system\r\nin New York on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main\r\ninvention, which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors\r\nas against a straight two-wire system throughout of the \"tree\" kind.\r\nHe soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for\r\ncommercial success not alone for the larger territory opening, but for\r\nthe compact districts of large cities. Being firmly convinced that there\r\nwas a way out, he pushed aside a mass of other work, and settled down to\r\nthis problem, with the result that on November 20, 1882, only two\r\nmonths after current had been sent out from Pearl Street, he executed an\r\napplication for a patent covering what is now known as the \"three-wire\r\nsystem.\" It has been universally recognized as one of the most valuable\r\ninventions in the history of the lighting art. [13] Its use resulted in a\r\nsaving of over 60 per cent. of copper in conductors, figured on the most\r\nfavorable basis previously known, inclusive of those calculated under\r\nhis own feeder and main system. Such economy of outlay being effected in\r\none of the heaviest items of expense in central-station construction,\r\nit was now made possible to establish plants in towns where the large\r\ninvestment would otherwise have been quite prohibitive. The invention\r\nis in universal use today, alike for direct and for alternating current,\r\nand as well in the equipment of large buildings as in the distribution\r\nsystem of the most extensive central-station networks. One cannot\r\nimagine the art without it.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 13: For technical description and illustration of\r\n     this invention, see Appendix.]\r\n\r\nThe strong position held by the Edison system, under the strenuous\r\ncompetition that was already springing up, was enormously improved by\r\nthe introduction of the three-wire system; and it gave an immediate\r\nimpetus to incandescent lighting. Desiring to put this new system into\r\npractical use promptly, and receiving applications for licenses from all\r\nover the country, Edison selected Brockton, Massachusetts, and Sunbury,\r\nPennsylvania, as the two towns for the trial. Of these two Brockton\r\nrequired the larger plant, but with the conductors placed underground.\r\nIt was the first to complete its arrangements and close its contract.\r\nMr. Henry Villard, it will be remembered, had married the daughter of\r\nGarrison, the famous abolitionist, and it was through his relationship\r\nwith the Garrison family that Brockton came to have the honor of\r\nexemplifying so soon the principles of an entirely new art. Sunbury,\r\nhowever, was a much smaller installation, employed overhead conductors,\r\nand hence was the first to \"cross the tape.\" It was specially suited for\r\na trial plant also, in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps\r\nto the horse-power was considered subject for congratulation. The town\r\nbeing situated in the coal region of Pennsylvania, good coal could then\r\nbe obtained there at seventy-five cents a ton.\r\n\r\nThe Sunbury generating plant consisted of an Armington & Sims engine\r\ndriving two small Edison dynamos having a total capacity of about four\r\nhundred lamps of 16 c.p. The indicating instruments were of the crudest\r\nconstruction, consisting of two voltmeters connected by \"pressure wires\"\r\nto the centre of electrical distribution. One ammeter, for measuring\r\nthe quantity of current output, was interpolated in the \"neutral bus\" or\r\nthird-wire return circuit to indicate when the load on the two machines\r\nwas out of balance. The circuits were opened and closed by means of\r\nabout half a dozen roughly made plug-switches. [14] The \"bus-bars\" to\r\nreceive the current from the dynamos were made of No. 000 copper line\r\nwire, straightened out and fastened to the wooden sheathing of the\r\nstation by iron staples without any presence to insulation. Commenting\r\nupon this Mr. W. S. Andrews, detailed from the central staff, says: \"The\r\ninterior winding of the Sunbury station, including the running of two\r\nthree-wire feeders the entire length of the building from back to\r\nfront, the wiring up of the dynamos and switchboard and all instruments,\r\ntogether with bus-bars, etc.--in fact, all labor and material used\r\nin the electrical wiring installation--amounted to the sum of $90. I\r\nreceived a rather sharp letter from the New York office expostulating\r\nfor this EXTRAVAGANT EXPENDITURE, and stating that great economy must\r\nbe observed in future!\" The street conductors were of the overhead\r\npole-line construction, and were installed by the construction company\r\nthat had been organized by Edison to build and equip central stations.\r\nA special type of street pole had been devised by him for the three-wire\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 14: By reason of the experience gained at this\r\n     station through the use of these crude plug-switches, Mr.\r\n     Edison started a competition among a few of his assistants\r\n     to devise something better. The result was the invention of\r\n     a \"breakdown\" switch by Mr. W. S. Andrews, which was\r\n     accepted by Mr. Edison as the best of the devices suggested,\r\n     and was developed and used for a great many years\r\n     afterward.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplementing the story of Mr. Andrews is that of Lieut. F. J. Sprague,\r\nwho also gives a curious glimpse of the glorious uncertainties and\r\nvicissitudes of that formative period. Mr. Sprague served on the jury\r\nat the Crystal Palace Exhibition with Darwin's son--the present Sir\r\nHorace--and after the tests were ended left the Navy and entered\r\nEdison's service at the suggestion of Mr. E. H. Johnson, who was\r\nEdison's shrewd recruiting sergeant in those days: \"I resigned sooner\r\nthan Johnson expected, and he had me on his hands. Meanwhile he had\r\ncalled upon me to make a report of the three-wire system, known in\r\nEngland as the Hopkinson, both Dr. John Hopkinson and Mr. Edison being\r\nindependent inventors at practically the same time. I reported on that,\r\nleft London, and landed in New York on the day of the opening of the\r\nBrooklyn Bridge in 1883--May 24--with a year's leave of absence.\r\n\r\n\"I reported at the office of Mr. Edison on Fifth Avenue and told him I\r\nhad seen Johnson. He looked me over and said: 'What did he promise you?'\r\nI replied: 'Twenty-five hundred dollars a year.' He did not say much,\r\nbut looked it. About that time Mr. Andrews and I came together. On July\r\n2d of that year we were ordered to Sunbury, and to be ready to start the\r\nstation on the fourth. The electrical work had to be done in forty-eight\r\nhours! Having travelled around the world, I had cultivated an\r\nindifference to any special difficulties of that kind. Mr. Andrews and\r\nI worked in collaboration until the night of the third. I think he was\r\nperhaps more appreciative than I was of the discipline of the Edison\r\nConstruction Department, and thought it would be well for us to wait\r\nuntil the morning of the fourth before we started up. I said we were\r\nsent over to get going, and insisted on starting up on the night of the\r\nthird. We had an Armington & Sims engine with sight-feed oiler. I had\r\nnever seen one, and did not know how it worked, with the result that we\r\nsoon burned up the babbitt metal in the bearings and spent a good part\r\nof the night getting them in order. The next day Mr. Edison, Mr. Insull,\r\nand the chief engineer of the construction department appeared on\r\nthe scene and wanted to know what had happened. They found an engine\r\nsomewhat loose in the bearings, and there followed remarks which would\r\nnot look well in print. Andrews skipped from under; he obeyed orders; I\r\ndid not. But the plant ran, and it was the first three-wire station in\r\nthis country.\"\r\n\r\nSeen from yet another angle, the worries of this early work were not\r\nmerely those of the men on the \"firing line.\" Mr. Insull, in speaking\r\nof this period, says: \"When it was found difficult to push the\r\ncentral-station business owing to the lack of confidence in its\r\nfinancial success, Edison decided to go into the business of promoting\r\nand constructing central-station plants, and he formed what was known as\r\nthe Thomas A. Edison Construction Department, which he put me in charge\r\nof. The organization was crude, the steam-engineering talent poor,\r\nand owing to the impossibility of getting any considerable capital\r\nsubscribed, the plants were put in as cheaply as possible. I believe\r\nthat this construction department was unkindly named the 'Destruction\r\nDepartment.' It served its purpose; never made any money; and I had the\r\nunpleasant task of presiding at its obsequies.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 4th the Sunbury plant was put into commercial operation by\r\nEdison, and he remained a week studying its conditions and watching for\r\nany unforeseen difficulty that might arise. Nothing happened, however,\r\nto interfere with the successful running of the station, and for twenty\r\nyears thereafter the same two dynamos continued to furnish light in\r\nSunbury. They were later used as reserve machines, and finally, with the\r\nengine, retired from service as part of the \"Collection of Edisonia\";\r\nbut they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in\r\n1883.\r\n\r\nSunbury was also provided with the first electro-chemical meters used\r\nin the United States outside New York City, so that it served also to\r\naccentuate electrical practice in a most vital respect--namely, the\r\nmeasurement of the electrical energy supplied to customers. At this time\r\nand long after, all arc lighting was done on a \"flat rate\" basis. The\r\narc lamp installed outside a customer's premises, or in a circuit for\r\npublic street lighting, burned so many hours nightly, so many nights in\r\nthe month; and was paid for at that rate, subject to rebate for hours\r\nwhen the lamp might be out through accident. The early arc lamps were\r\nrated to require 9 to 10 amperes of current, at 45 volts pressure each,\r\nreceiving which they were estimated to give 2000 c.p., which was arrived\r\nat by adding together the light found at four different positions, so\r\nthat in reality the actual light was about 500 c.p. Few of these data\r\nwere ever actually used, however; and it was all more or less a matter\r\nof guesswork, although the central-station manager, aiming to give good\r\nservice, would naturally see that the dynamos were so operated as to\r\nmaintain as steadily as possible the normal potential and current. The\r\nsame loose methods applied to the early attempts to use electric motors\r\non arc-lighting circuits, and contracts were made based on the size of\r\nthe motor, the width of the connecting belt, or the amount of power the\r\ncustomer thought he used--never on the measurement of the electrical\r\nenergy furnished him.\r\n\r\nHere again Edison laid the foundation of standard practice. It is true\r\nthat even down to the present time the flat rate is applied to a great\r\ndeal of incandescent lighting, each lamp being charged for individually\r\naccording to its probable consumption during each month. This may\r\nanswer, perhaps, in a small place where the manager can gauge pretty\r\nclosely from actual observation what each customer does; but even then\r\nthere are elements of risk and waste; and obviously in a large city such\r\na method would soon be likely to result in financial disaster to the\r\nplant. Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like\r\ngas or water, and he proceeded to develop a meter. There was infinite\r\nscepticism around him on the subject, and while other inventors were\r\nalso giving the subject their thought, the public took it for granted\r\nthat anything so utterly intangible as electricity, that could not be\r\nseen or weighed, and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact\r\npoint of use, could not be brought to accurate registration. The general\r\nattitude of doubt was exemplified by the incident in Mr. J. P. Morgan's\r\noffice, noted in the last chapter. Edison, however, had satisfied\r\nhimself that there were various ways of accomplishing the task, and had\r\ndetermined that the current should be measured on the premises of\r\nevery consumer. His electrolytic meter was very successful, and was\r\nof widespread use in America and in Europe until the perfection of\r\nmechanical meters by Elihu Thomson and others brought that type into\r\ngeneral acceptance. Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer\r\nused, despite its excellent qualities. Houston & Kennelly in their\r\nElectricity in Everyday Life sum the matter up as follows: \"The Edison\r\nchemical meter is capable of giving fair measurements of the amount of\r\ncurrent passing. By reason, however, of dissatisfaction caused from the\r\ninability of customers to read the indications of the meter, it has in\r\nlater years, to a great extent, been replaced by registering meters that\r\ncan be read by the customer.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle employed in the Edison electrolytic meter is that which\r\nexemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance.\r\nIn other words it is a deposition bath, consisting of a glass cell in\r\nwhich two plates of chemically pure zinc are dipped in a solution of\r\nzinc sulphate. When the lights or motors in the circuit are turned on,\r\nand a certain definite small portion of the current is diverted to flow\r\nthrough the meter, from the positive plate to the negative plate, the\r\nlatter increases in weight by receiving a deposit of metallic zinc; the\r\npositive plate meantime losing in weight by the metal thus carried\r\naway from it. This difference in weight is a very exact measure of the\r\nquantity of electricity, or number of ampere-hours, that have, so to\r\nspeak, passed through the cell, and hence of the whole consumption in\r\nthe circuit. The amount thus due from the customer is ascertained by\r\nremoving the cell, washing and drying the plates, and weighing them in\r\na chemical balance. Associated with this simple form of apparatus\r\nwere various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of\r\noperation, freedom from inaccuracy, and immunity from such tampering\r\nas would permit theft of current or damage. As the freezing of the zinc\r\nsulphate solution in cold weather would check its operation, Edison\r\nintroduced, for example, into the meter an incandescent lamp and a\r\nthermostat so arranged that when the temperature fell to a certain\r\npoint, or rose above another point, it was cut in or out; and in this\r\nmanner the meter could be kept from freezing. The standard Edison meter\r\npractice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter-room of the\r\ncentral-station company for examination, another set being substituted.\r\nThe meter was cheap to manufacture and install, and not at all liable to\r\nget out of order.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1888, Mr. W. J. Jenks read an interesting paper before the\r\nAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers on the six years of practical\r\nexperience had up to that time with the meter, then more generally in\r\nuse than any other. It appears from the paper that twenty-three Edison\r\nstations were then equipped with 5187 meters, which were relied upon for\r\nbilling the monthly current consumption of 87,856 lamps and 350 motors\r\nof 1000 horse-power total. This represented about 75 per cent. of the\r\nentire lamp capacity of the stations. There was an average cost per lamp\r\nfor meter operation of twenty-two cents a year, and each meter took\r\ncare of an average of seventeen lamps. It is worthy of note, as to the\r\npromptness with which the Edison stations became paying properties,\r\nthat four of the metered stations were earning upward of 15 per cent.\r\non their capital stock; three others between 8 and 10 per cent.; eight\r\nbetween 5 and 8 per cent.; the others having been in operation too short\r\na time to show definite results, although they also went quickly to\r\na dividend basis. Reports made in the discussion at the meeting by\r\nengineers showed the simplicity and success of the meter. Mr. C. L.\r\nEdgar, of the Boston Edison system, stated that he had 800 of the meters\r\nin service cared for by two men and three boys, the latter employed in\r\ncollecting the meter cells; the total cost being perhaps $2500 a year.\r\nMr. J. W. Lieb wrote from Milan, Italy, that he had in use on the Edison\r\nsystem there 360 meters ranging from 350 ampere-hours per month up to\r\n30,000.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should be mentioned that the Association of Edison\r\nIlluminating Companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously\r\nto the effect that the Edison meter was accurate, and that its use was\r\nnot expensive for stations above one thousand lights; and that the best\r\nfinancial results were invariably secured in a station selling current\r\nby meter. Before the same association, at its meeting in September,\r\n1898, at Sault Ste. Marie, Mr. C. S. Shepard read a paper on the meter\r\npractice of the New York Edison Company, giving data as to the large\r\nnumber of Edison meters in use and the transition to other types, of\r\nwhich to-day the company has several on its circuits: \"Until October,\r\n1896, the New York Edison Company metered its current in consumer's\r\npremises exclusively by the old-style chemical meters, of which there\r\nwere connected on that date 8109. It was then determined to purchase\r\nno more.\" Mr. Shepard went on to state that the chemical meters were\r\ngradually displaced, and that on September 1, 1898, there were on the\r\nsystem 5619 mechanical and 4874 chemical. The meter continued in general\r\nservice during 1899, and probably up to the close of the century.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews relates a rather humorous meter story of those early days:\r\n\"The meter man at Sunbury was a firm and enthusiastic believer in the\r\ncorrectness of the Edison meter, having personally verified its reading\r\nmany times by actual comparison of lamp-hours. One day, on making out a\r\ncustomer's bill, his confidence received a severe shock, for the meter\r\nreading showed a consumption calling for a charge of over $200,\r\nwhereas he knew that the light actually used should not cost more than\r\none-quarter of that amount. He weighed and reweighed the meter plates,\r\nand pursued every line of investigation imaginable, but all in vain. He\r\nfelt he was up against it, and that perhaps another kind of a job would\r\nsuit him better. Once again he went to the customer's meter to look\r\naround, when a small piece of thick wire on the floor caught his eye.\r\nThe problem was solved. He suddenly remembered that after weighing\r\nthe plates he went and put them in the customer's meter; but the wire\r\nattached to one of the plates was too long to go in the meter, and he\r\nhad cut it off. He picked up the piece of wire, took it to the station,\r\nweighed it carefully, and found that it accounted for about $150 worth\r\nof electricity, which was the amount of the difference.\"\r\n\r\nEdison himself is, however, the best repertory of stories when it comes\r\nto the difficulties of that early period, in connection with metering\r\nthe current and charging for it. He may be quoted at length as follows:\r\n\"When we started the station at Pearl Street, in September, 1882, we\r\nwere not very commercial. We put many customers on, but did not make out\r\nmany bills. We were more interested in the technical condition of the\r\nstation than in the commercial part. We had meters in which there were\r\ntwo bottles of liquid. To prevent these electrolytes from freezing we\r\nhad in each meter a strip of metal. When it got very cold the metal\r\nwould contract and close a circuit, and throw a lamp into circuit\r\ninside the meter. The heat from this lamp would prevent the liquid from\r\nfreezing, so that the meter could go on doing its duty. The first cold\r\nday after starting the station, people began to come in from their\r\noffices, especially down in Front Street and Water Street, saying the\r\nmeter was on fire. We received numerous telephone messages about it.\r\nSome had poured water on it, and others said: 'Send a man right up to\r\nput it out.'\r\n\r\n\"After the station had been running several months and was technically\r\na success, we began to look after the financial part. We started to\r\ncollect some bills; but we found that our books were kept badly, and\r\nthat the person in charge, who was no business man, had neglected that\r\npart of it. In fact, he did not know anything about the station, anyway.\r\nSo I got the directors to permit me to hire a man to run the station.\r\nThis was Mr. Chinnock, who was then superintendent of the Metropolitan\r\nTelephone Company of New York. I knew Chinnock to be square and of\r\ngood business ability, and induced him to leave his job. I made him a\r\npersonal guarantee, that if he would take hold of the station and put it\r\non a commercial basis, and pay 5 per cent. on $600,000, I would give him\r\n$10,000 out of my own pocket. He took hold, performed the feat, and\r\nI paid him the $10,000. I might remark in this connection that years\r\nafterward I applied to the Edison Electric Light Company asking them\r\nif they would not like to pay me this money, as it was spent when I was\r\nvery hard up and made the company a success, and was the foundation of\r\ntheir present prosperity. They said they 'were sorry'--that is, 'Wall\r\nStreet sorry'--and refused to pay it. This shows what a nice, genial,\r\ngenerous lot of people they have over in Wall Street.\r\n\r\n\"Chinnock had a great deal of trouble getting the customers straightened\r\nout. I remember one man who had a saloon on Nassau Street. He had had\r\nhis lights burning for two or three months. It was in June, and Chinnock\r\nput in a bill for $20; July for $20; August about $28; September about\r\n$35. Of course the nights were getting longer. October about $40;\r\nNovember about $45. Then the man called Chinnock up. He said: 'I want to\r\nsee you about my electric-light bill.' Chinnock went up to see him. He\r\nsaid: 'Are you the manager of this electric-light plant?' Chinnock said:\r\n'I have the honor.' 'Well,' he said, my bill has gone from $20 up to\r\n$28, $35, $45. I want you to understand, young fellow, that my limit is\r\n$60.'\r\n\r\n\"After Chinnock had had all this trouble due to the incompetency of the\r\nprevious superintendent, a man came in and said to him: 'Did Mr. Blank\r\nhave charge of this station?' 'Yes.' 'Did he know anything about running\r\na station like this?' Chinnock said: 'Does he KNOW anything about\r\nrunning a station like this? No, sir. He doesn't even suspect anything.'\r\n\r\n\"One day Chinnock came to me and said: 'I have a new customer.' I said:\r\n'What is it?' He said: 'I have a fellow who is going to take two hundred\r\nand fifty lights.' I said: 'What for?' 'He has a place down here in a\r\ntop loft, and has got two hundred and fifty barrels of \"rotgut\" whiskey.\r\nHe puts a light down in the barrel and lights it up, and it ages the\r\nwhiskey.' I met Chinnock several weeks after, and said: 'How is the\r\nwhiskey man getting along?' 'It's all right; he is paying his bill. It\r\nfixes the whiskey and takes the shudder right out of it.' Somebody went\r\nand took out a patent on this idea later.\r\n\r\n\"In the second year we put the Stock Exchange on the circuits of the\r\nstation, but were very fearful that there would be a combination of\r\nheavy demand and a dark day, and that there would be an overloaded\r\nstation. We had an index like a steam-gauge, called an ampere-meter, to\r\nindicate the amount of current going out. I was up at 65 Fifth Avenue\r\none afternoon. A sudden black cloud came up, and I telephoned to\r\nChinnock and asked him about the load. He said: 'We are up to the\r\nmuzzle, and everything is running all right.' By-and-by it became so\r\nthick we could not see across the street. I telephoned again, and felt\r\nsomething would happen, but fortunately it did not. I said to\r\nChinnock: 'How is it now?' He replied: 'Everything is red-hot, and the\r\nampere-meter has made seventeen revolutions.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883 no such fittings as \"fixture insulators\" were known. It was\r\nthe common practice to twine the electric wires around the disused\r\ngas-fixtures, fasten them with tape or string, and connect them to\r\nlamp-sockets screwed into attachments under the gas-burners--elaborated\r\nlater into what was known as the \"combination fixture.\" As a result\r\nit was no uncommon thing to see bright sparks snapping between the\r\nchandelier and the lighting wires during a sharp thunder-storm. A\r\nstartling manifestation of this kind happened at Sunbury, when the vivid\r\ndisplay drove nervous guests of the hotel out into the street, and the\r\nprovidential storm led Mr. Luther Stieringer to invent the \"insulating\r\njoint.\" This separated the two lighting systems thoroughly, went into\r\nimmediate service, and is universally used to-day.\r\n\r\nReturning to the more specific subject of pioneer plants of importance,\r\nthat at Brockton must be considered for a moment, chiefly for the reason\r\nthat the city was the first in the world to possess an Edison station\r\ndistributing current through an underground three-wire network of\r\nconductors--the essentially modern contemporaneous practice,\r\nstandard twenty-five years later. It was proposed to employ pole-line\r\nconstruction with overhead wires, and a party of Edison engineers drove\r\nabout the town in an open barouche with a blue-print of the circuits and\r\nstreets spread out on their knees, to determine how much tree-trimming\r\nwould be necessary. When they came to some heavily shaded spots, the\r\nfine trees were marked \"T\" to indicate that the work in getting through\r\nthem would be \"tough.\" Where the trees were sparse and the foliage was\r\nthin, the same cheerful band of vandals marked the spots \"E\" to indicate\r\nthat there it would be \"easy\" to run the wires. In those days public\r\nopinion was not so alive as now to the desirability of preserving\r\nshade-trees, and of enhancing the beauty of a city instead of destroying\r\nit. Brockton had a good deal of pride in its fine trees, and a strong\r\nsentiment was very soon aroused against the mutilation proposed so\r\nthoughtlessly. The investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious\r\nto meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground. Edison's own\r\nwishes were altogether for the use of the methods he had so carefully\r\ndevised; and hence that bustling home of shoe manufacture was spared\r\nthis infliction of more overhead wires.\r\n\r\nThe station equipment at Brockton consisted at first of three dynamos,\r\none of which was so arranged as to supply both sides of the system\r\nduring light loads by a breakdown switch connection. This arrangement\r\ninterfered with correct meter registration, as the meters on one side of\r\nthe system registered backward during the hours in which the combination\r\nwas employed. Hence, after supplying an all-night customer whose lamps\r\nwere on one side of the circuits, the company might be found to owe him\r\nsome thing substantial in the morning. Soon after the station went into\r\noperation this ingenious plan was changed, and the third dynamo was\r\nreplaced by two others. The Edison construction department took entire\r\ncharge of the installation of the plant, and the formal opening was\r\nattended on October 1, 1883, by Mr. Edison, who then remained a week in\r\nceaseless study and consultation over the conditions developed by\r\nthis initial three-wire underground plant. Some idea of the confidence\r\ninspired by the fame of Edison at this period is shown by the fact that\r\nthe first theatre ever lighted from a central station by incandescent\r\nlamps was designed this year, and opened in 1884 at Brockton with an\r\nequipment of three hundred lamps. The theatre was never piped for gas!\r\nIt was also from the Brockton central station that current was first\r\nsupplied to a fire-engine house--another display of remarkably early\r\nbelief in the trustworthiness of the service, under conditions where\r\ncontinuity of lighting was vital. The building was equipped in such a\r\nmanner that the striking of the fire-alarm would light every lamp in\r\nthe house automatically and liberate the horses. It was at this central\r\nstation that Lieutenant Sprague began his historic work on the electric\r\nmotor; and here that another distinguished engineer and inventor, Mr. H.\r\nWard Leonard, installed the meters and became meter man, in order that\r\nhe might study in every intimate detail the improvements and refinements\r\nnecessary in that branch of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe authors are indebted for these facts and some other data embodied in\r\nthis book to Mr. W. J. Jenks, who as manager of this plant here made his\r\ndebut in the Edison ranks. He had been connected with local telephone\r\ninterests, but resigned to take active charge of this plant, imbibing\r\nquickly the traditional Edison spirit, working hard all day and sleeping\r\nin the station at night on a cot brought there for that purpose. It\r\nwas a time of uninterrupted watchfulness. The difficulty of obtaining\r\nengineers in those days to run the high-speed engines (three hundred and\r\nfifty revolutions per minute) is well illustrated by an amusing incident\r\nin the very early history of the station. A locomotive engineer had\r\nbeen engaged, as it was supposed he would not be afraid of anything. One\r\nevening there came a sudden flash of fire and a spluttering, sizzling\r\nnoise. There had been a short-circuit on the copper mains in the\r\nstation. The fireman hid behind the boiler and the engineer jumped out\r\nof the window. Mr. Sprague realized the trouble, quickly threw off the\r\ncurrent and stopped the engine.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenks relates another humorous incident in connection with this\r\nplant: \"One night I heard a knock at the office door, and on opening it\r\nsaw two well-dressed ladies, who asked if they might be shown through.\r\nI invited them in, taking them first to the boiler-room, where I showed\r\nthem the coal-pile, explaining that this was used to generate steam in\r\nthe boiler. We then went to the dynamo-room, where I pointed out the\r\nmachines converting the steam-power into electricity, appearing later in\r\nthe form of light in the lamps. After that they were shown the meters\r\nby which the consumption of current was measured. They appeared to be\r\ninterested, and I proceeded to enter upon a comparison of coal made\r\ninto gas or burned under a boiler to be converted into electricity. The\r\nladies thanked me effusively and brought their visit to a close. As they\r\nwere about to go through the door, one of them turned to me and said:\r\n'We have enjoyed this visit very much, but there is one question we\r\nwould like to ask: What is it that you make here?'\"\r\n\r\nThe Brockton station was for a long time a show plant of the Edison\r\ncompany, and had many distinguished visitors, among them being Prof.\r\nElihu Thomson, who was present at the opening, and Sir W. H. Preece,\r\nof London. The engineering methods pursued formed the basis of similar\r\ninstallations in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in November, 1883; in Fall\r\nRiver, Massachusetts, in December, 1883; and in Newburgh, New York, the\r\nfollowing spring.\r\n\r\nAnother important plant of this period deserves special mention, as it\r\nwas the pioneer in the lighting of large spaces by incandescent lamps.\r\nThis installation of five thousand lamps on the three-wire system was\r\nmade to illuminate the buildings at the Louisville, Kentucky,\r\nExposition in 1883, and, owing to the careful surveys, calculations,\r\nand preparations of H. M. Byllesby and the late Luther Stieringer, was\r\ncompleted and in operation within six weeks after the placing of the\r\norder. The Jury of Awards, in presenting four medals to the Edison\r\ncompany, took occasion to pay a high compliment to the efficiency of the\r\nsystem. It has been thought by many that the magnificent success of\r\nthis plant did more to stimulate the growth of the incandescent lighting\r\nbusiness than any other event in the history of the Edison company. It\r\nwas literally the beginning of the electrical illumination of American\r\nExpositions, carried later to such splendid displays as those of the\r\nChicago World's Fair in 1893, Buffalo in 1901, and St. Louis in 1904.\r\n\r\nThus the art was set going in the United States under many difficulties,\r\nbut with every sign of coming triumph. Reference has already been made\r\nto the work abroad in Paris and London. The first permanent Edison\r\nstation in Europe was that at Milan, Italy, for which the order was\r\ngiven as early as May, 1882, by an enterprising syndicate. Less than\r\na year later, March 3, 1883, the installation was ready and was put in\r\noperation, the Theatre Santa Radegonda having been pulled down and a\r\nnew central-station building erected in its place--probably the first\r\nedifice constructed in Europe for the specific purpose of incandescent\r\nlighting. Here \"Jumbos\" were installed from time to time, until at\r\nlast there were no fewer than ten of them; and current was furnished\r\nto customers with a total of nearly ten thousand lamps connected to the\r\nmains. This pioneer system was operated continuously until February\r\n9, 1900, or for a period of about seventeen years, when the sturdy old\r\nmachines, still in excellent condition, were put out of service, so that\r\na larger plant could be installed to meet the demand. This new plant\r\ntakes high-tension polyphase current from a water-power thirty or forty\r\nmiles away at Paderno, on the river Adda, flowing from the Apennines;\r\nbut delivers low-tension direct current for distribution to the regular\r\nEdison three-wire system throughout Milan.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that southern Europe was thus opened up to the\r\nnew system, South America came into line, and the first Edison central\r\nstation there was installed at Santiago, Chile, in the summer of 1883,\r\nunder the supervision of Mr. W. N. Stewart. This was the result of the\r\nsuccess obtained with small isolated plants, leading to the formation of\r\nan Edison company. It can readily be conceived that at such an extreme\r\ndistance from the source of supply of apparatus the plant was subject to\r\nmany peculiar difficulties from the outset, of which Mr. Stewart speaks\r\nas follows: \"I made an exhibition of the 'Jumbo' in the theatre\r\nat Santiago, and on the first evening, when it was filled with the\r\naristocracy of the city, I discovered to my horror that the binding wire\r\naround the armature was slowly stripping off and going to pieces. We had\r\nno means of boring out the field magnets, and we cut grooves in them.\r\nI think the machine is still running (1907). The station went into\r\noperation soon after with an equipment of eight Edison 'K' dynamos with\r\ncertain conditions inimical to efficiency, but which have not hindered\r\nthe splendid expansion of the local system. With those eight dynamos we\r\nhad four belts between each engine and the dynamo. The steam pressure\r\nwas limited to seventy-five pounds per square inch. We had two-wire\r\nunderground feeders, sent without any plans or specifications for their\r\ninstallation. The station had neither voltmeter nor ammeter. The current\r\npressure was regulated by a galvanometer. We were using coal costing $12\r\na ton, and were paid for our light in currency worth fifty cents on the\r\ndollar. The only thing I can be proud of in connection with the plant is\r\nthe fact that I did not design it, that once in a while we made out to\r\npay its operating expenses, and that occasionally we could run it for\r\nthree months without a total breakdown.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1885 that the first Edison station in Germany was\r\nestablished; but the art was still very young, and the plant represented\r\npioneer lighting practice in the Empire. The station at Berlin comprised\r\nfive boilers, and six vertical steam-engines driving by belts twelve\r\nEdison dynamos, each of about fifty-five horse-power capacity. A model\r\nof this station is preserved in the Deutschen Museum at Munich. In the\r\nbulletin of the Berlin Electricity Works for May, 1908, it is said with\r\nregard to the events that led up to the creation of the system, as noted\r\nalready at the Rathenau celebration: \"The year 1881 was a mile-stone\r\nin the history of the Allgemeine Elektricitaets Gesellschaft. The\r\nInternational Electrical Exposition at Paris was intended to place\r\nbefore the eyes of the civilized world the achievements of the\r\ncentury. Among the exhibits of that Exposition was the Edison system\r\nof incandescent lighting. IT BECAME THE BASIS OF MODERN HEAVY\r\nCURRENT TECHNICS.\" The last phrase is italicized as being a happy and\r\nauthoritative description, as well as a tribute.\r\n\r\nThis chapter would not be complete if it failed to include some\r\nreference to a few of the earlier isolated plants of a historic\r\ncharacter. Note has already been made of the first Edison plants afloat\r\non the Jeannette and Columbia, and the first commercial plant in the New\r\nYork lithographic establishment. The first mill plant was placed in the\r\nwoollen factory of James Harrison at Newburgh, New York, about September\r\n15, 1881. A year later, Mr. Harrison wrote with some pride: \"I believe\r\nmy mill was the first lighted with your electric light, and therefore\r\nmay be called No. 1. Besides being job No. 1 it is a No. 1 job, and a\r\nNo. 1 light, being better and cheaper than gas and absolutely safe as\r\nto fire.\" The first steam-yacht lighted by incandescent lamps was James\r\nGordon Bennett's Namouna, equipped early in 1882 with a plant for one\r\nhundred and twenty lamps of eight candlepower, which remained in use\r\nthere many years afterward.\r\n\r\nThe first Edison plant in a hotel was started in October, 1881, at the\r\nBlue Mountain House in the Adirondacks, and consisted of two \"Z\" dynamos\r\nwith a complement of eight and sixteen candle lamps. The hotel is\r\nsituated at an elevation of thirty-five hundred feet above the sea, and\r\nwas at that time forty miles from the railroad. The machinery was taken\r\nup in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain. The\r\nboilers were fired by wood, as the economical transportation of coal was\r\na physical impossibility. For a six-hour run of the plant one-quarter of\r\na cord of wood was required, at a cost of twenty-five cents per cord.\r\n\r\nThe first theatre in the United States to be lighted by an Edison\r\nisolated plant was the Bijou Theatre, Boston. The installation of\r\nboilers, engines, dynamos, wiring, switches, fixtures, three stage\r\nregulators, and six hundred and fifty lamps, was completed in eleven\r\ndays after receipt of the order, and the plant was successfully operated\r\nat the opening of the theatre, on December 12, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe first plant to be placed on a United States steamship was the\r\none consisting of an Edison \"Z\" dynamo and one hundred and twenty\r\neight-candle lamps installed on the Fish Commission's steamer Albatross\r\nin 1883. The most interesting feature of this installation was the\r\nemployment of special deep-sea lamps, supplied with current through a\r\ncable nine hundred and forty feet in length, for the purpose of alluring\r\nfish. By means of the brilliancy of the lamps marine animals in the\r\nlower depths were attracted and then easily ensnared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC RAILWAY\r\n\r\nEDISON had no sooner designed his dynamo in 1879 than he adopted the\r\nsame form of machine for use as a motor. The two are shown in the\r\nScientific American of October 18, 1879, and are alike, except that\r\nthe dynamo is vertical and the motor lies in a horizontal position,\r\nthe article remarking: \"Its construction differs but slightly from the\r\nelectric generator.\" This was but an evidence of his early appreciation\r\nof the importance of electricity as a motive power; but it will probably\r\nsurprise many people to know that he was the inventor of an electric\r\nmotor before he perfected his incandescent lamp. His interest in the\r\nsubject went back to his connection with General Lefferts in the days of\r\nthe evolution of the stock ticker. While Edison was carrying on his shop\r\nat Newark, New Jersey, there was considerable excitement in electrical\r\ncircles over the Payne motor, in regard to the alleged performance of\r\nwhich Governor Cornell of New York and other wealthy capitalists were\r\nquite enthusiastic. Payne had a shop in Newark, and in one small room\r\nwas the motor, weighing perhaps six hundred pounds. It was of circular\r\nform, incased in iron, with the ends of several small magnets sticking\r\nthrough the floor. A pulley and belt, connected to a circular saw larger\r\nthan the motor, permitted large logs of oak timber to be sawed with ease\r\nwith the use of two small cells of battery. Edison's friend, General\r\nLefferts, had become excited and was determined to invest a large sum\r\nof money in the motor company, but knowing Edison's intimate familiarity\r\nwith all electrical subjects he was wise enough to ask his young expert\r\nto go and see the motor with him. At an appointed hour Edison went to\r\nthe office of the motor company and found there the venerable Professor\r\nMorse, Governor Cornell, General Lefferts, and many others who had been\r\ninvited to witness a performance of the motor. They all proceeded to the\r\nroom where the motor was at work. Payne put a wire in the binding-post\r\nof the battery, the motor started, and an assistant began sawing a heavy\r\noak log. It worked beautifully, and so great was the power developed,\r\napparently, from the small battery, that Morse exclaimed: \"I am thankful\r\nthat I have lived to see this day.\" But Edison kept a close watch on the\r\nmotor. The results were so foreign to his experience that he knew there\r\nwas a trick in it. He soon discovered it. While holding his hand on the\r\nframe of the motor he noticed a tremble coincident with the exhaust of\r\nan engine across the alleyway, and he then knew that the power came from\r\nthe engine by a belt under the floor, shifted on and off by a magnet,\r\nthe other magnets being a blind. He whispered to the General to put\r\nhis hand on the frame of the motor, watch the exhaust, and note the\r\ncoincident tremor. The General did so, and in about fifteen seconds he\r\nsaid: \"Well, Edison, I must go now. This thing is a fraud.\" And thus\r\nhe saved his money, although others not so shrewdly advised were easily\r\npersuaded to invest by such a demonstration.\r\n\r\nA few years later, in 1878, Edison went to Wyoming with a group of\r\nastronomers, to test his tasimeter during an eclipse of the sun, and\r\nsaw the land white to harvest. He noticed the long hauls to market or\r\nelevator that the farmers had to make with their loads of grain at great\r\nexpense, and conceived the idea that as ordinary steam-railroad service\r\nwas too costly, light electric railways might be constructed that could\r\nbe operated automatically over simple tracks, the propelling motors\r\nbeing controlled at various points. Cheap to build and cheap to\r\nmaintain, such roads would be a great boon to the newer farming regions\r\nof the West, where the highways were still of the crudest character, and\r\nwhere transportation was the gravest difficulty with which the settlers\r\nhad to contend. The plan seems to have haunted him, and he had no\r\nsooner worked out a generator and motor that owing to their low internal\r\nresistance could be operated efficiently, than he turned his hand to the\r\npractical trial of such a railroad, applicable to both the haulage of\r\nfreight and the transportation of passengers. Early in 1880, when the\r\ntremendous rush of work involved in the invention of the incandescent\r\nlamp intermitted a little, he began the construction of a stretch of\r\ntrack close to the Menlo Park laboratory, and at the same time built an\r\nelectric locomotive to operate over it.\r\n\r\nThis is a fitting stage at which to review briefly what had been done\r\nin electric traction up to that date. There was absolutely no art, but\r\nthere had been a number of sporadic and very interesting experiments\r\nmade. The honor of the first attempt of any kind appears to rest with\r\nthis country and with Thomas Davenport, a self-trained blacksmith, of\r\nBrandon, Vermont, who made a small model of a circular electric railway\r\nand cars in 1834, and exhibited it the following year in Springfield,\r\nBoston, and other cities. Of course he depended upon batteries for\r\ncurrent, but the fundamental idea was embodied of using the track for\r\nthe circuit, one rail being positive and the other negative, and the\r\nmotor being placed across or between them in multiple arc to receive\r\nthe current. Such are also practically the methods of to-day. The little\r\nmodel was in good preservation up to the year 1900, when, being shipped\r\nto the Paris Exposition, it was lost, the steamer that carried it\r\nfoundering in mid-ocean. The very broad patent taken out by this simple\r\nmechanic, so far ahead of his times, was the first one issued in\r\nAmerica for an electric motor. Davenport was also the first man to apply\r\nelectric power to the printing-press, in 1840. In his traction work he\r\nhad a close second in Robert Davidson, of Aberdeen, Scotland, who in\r\n1839 operated both a lathe and a small locomotive with the motor he had\r\ninvented. His was the credit of first actually carrying passengers--two\r\nat a time, over a rough plank road--while it is said that his was the\r\nfirst motor to be tried on real tracks, those of the Edinburgh-Glasgow\r\nroad, making a speed of four miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe curse of this work and of all that succeeded it for a score of years\r\nwas the necessity of depending upon chemical batteries for current, the\r\nmachine usually being self-contained and hauling the batteries along\r\nwith itself, as in the case of the famous Page experiments in April,\r\n1851, when a speed of nineteen miles an hour was attained on the line\r\nof the Washington & Baltimore road. To this unfruitful period belonged,\r\nhowever, the crude idea of taking the current from a stationary source\r\nof power by means of an overhead contact, which has found its practical\r\nevolution in the modern ubiquitous trolley; although the patent for\r\nthis, based on his caveat of 1879, was granted several years later\r\nthan that to Stephen D. Field, for the combination of an electric motor\r\noperated by means of a current from a stationary dynamo or source of\r\nelectricity conducted through the rails. As a matter of fact, in 1856\r\nand again in 1875, George F. Green, a jobbing machinist, of Kalamazoo,\r\nMichigan, built small cars and tracks to which current was fed from a\r\ndistant battery, enough energy being utilized to haul one hundred pounds\r\nof freight or one passenger up and down a \"road\" two hundred feet long.\r\nAll the work prior to the development of the dynamo as a source of\r\ncurrent was sporadic and spasmodic, and cannot be said to have left any\r\ntrace on the art, though it offered many suggestions as to operative\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nThe close of the same decade of the nineteenth century that saw the\r\nelectric light brought to perfection, saw also the realization in\r\npractice of all the hopes of fifty years as to electric traction. Both\r\nutilizations depended upon the supply of current now cheaply obtainable\r\nfrom the dynamo. These arts were indeed twins, feeding at inexhaustible\r\nbreasts. In 1879, at the Berlin Exhibition, the distinguished firm of\r\nSiemens, to whose ingenuity and enterprise electrical development owes\r\nso much, installed a road about one-third of a mile in length, over\r\nwhich the locomotive hauled a train of three small cars at a speed of\r\nabout eight miles an hour, carrying some twenty persons every trip.\r\nCurrent was fed from a dynamo to the motor through a central third rail,\r\nthe two outer rails being joined together as the negative or return\r\ncircuit. Primitive but essentially successful, this little road made a\r\nprofound impression on the minds of many inventors and engineers, and\r\nmarked the real beginning of the great new era, which has already seen\r\nelectricity applied to the operation of main lines of trunk railways.\r\nBut it is not to be supposed that on the part of the public there was\r\nany great amount of faith then discernible; and for some years the\r\npioneers had great difficulty, especially in this country, in raising\r\nmoney for their early modest experiments. Of the general conditions at\r\nthis moment Frank J. Sprague says in an article in the Century Magazine\r\nof July, 1905, on the creation of the new art: \"Edison was perhaps\r\nnearer the verge of great electric-railway possibilities than any other\r\nAmerican. In the face of much adverse criticism he had developed the\r\nessentials of the low-internal-resistance dynamo with high-resistance\r\nfield, and many of the essential features of multiple-arc distribution,\r\nand in 1880 he built a small road at his laboratory at Menlo Park.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 13th of the year named this interesting road went into operation\r\nas the result of hard and hurried work of preparation during the spring\r\nmonths. The first track was about a third of a mile in length, starting\r\nfrom the shops, following a country road, passing around a hill at the\r\nrear and curving home, in the general form of the letter \"U.\" The rails\r\nwere very light. Charles T. Hughes, who went with Edison in 1879,\r\nand was in charge of much of the work, states that they were \"second\"\r\nstreet-car rails, insulated with tar canvas paper and things of that\r\nsort--\"asphalt.\" They were spiked down on ordinary sleepers laid upon\r\nthe natural grade, and the gauge was about three feet six inches. At one\r\npoint the grade dropped some sixty feet in a distance of three hundred,\r\nand the curves were of recklessly short radius. The dynamos supplying\r\ncurrent to the road were originally two of the standard size \"Z\"\r\nmachines then being made at the laboratory, popularly known throughout\r\nthe Edison ranks as \"Longwaisted Mary Anns,\" and the circuits from these\r\nwere carried out to the rails by underground conductors. They were not\r\nlarge--about twelve horse-power each--generating seventy-five amperes\r\nof current at one hundred and ten volts, so that not quite twenty-five\r\nhorse-power of electrical energy was available for propulsion.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive built while the roadbed was getting ready was a\r\nfour-wheeled iron truck, an ordinary flat dump-car about six feet long\r\nand four feet wide, upon which was mounted a \"Z\" dynamo used as a motor,\r\nso that it had a capacity of about twelve horsepower. This machine was\r\nlaid on its side, with the armature end coming out at the front of the\r\nlocomotive, and the motive power was applied to the driving-axle by a\r\ncumbersome series of friction pulleys. Each wheel of the locomotive had\r\na metal rim and a centre web of wood or papier-mache, and the current\r\npicked up by one set of wheels was carried through contact brushes and\r\na brass hub to the motor; the circuit back to the track, or other rail,\r\nbeing closed through the other wheels in a similar manner. The motor had\r\nits field-magnet circuit in permanent connection as a shunt across the\r\nrails, protected by a crude bare copper-wire safety-catch. A switch in\r\nthe armature circuit enabled the motorman to reverse the direction of\r\ntravel by reversing the current flow through the armature coils.\r\n\r\nThings went fairly well for a time on that memorable Thursday afternoon,\r\nwhen all the laboratory force made high holiday and scrambled for\r\nfoothold on the locomotive for a trip; but the friction gearing was\r\nnot equal to the sudden strain put upon it during one run and went to\r\npieces. Some years later, also, Daft again tried friction gear in his\r\nhistorical experiments on the Manhattan Elevated road, but the results\r\nwere attended with no greater success. The next resort of Edison was to\r\nbelts, the armature shafting belted to a countershaft on the locomotive\r\nframe, and the countershaft belted to a pulley on the car-axle. The\r\nlever which threw the former friction gear into adjustment was made to\r\noperate an idler pulley for tightening the axle-belt. When the motor\r\nwas started, the armature was brought up to full revolution and then the\r\nbelt was tightened on the car-axle, compelling motion of the locomotive.\r\nBut the belts were liable to slip a great deal in the process, and the\r\nchafing of the belts charred them badly. If that did not happen, and if\r\nthe belt was made taut suddenly, the armature burned out--which it\r\ndid with disconcerting frequency. The next step was to use a number of\r\nresistance-boxes in series with the armature, so that the locomotive\r\ncould start with those in circuit, and then the motorman could bring it\r\nup to speed gradually by cutting one box out after the other. To stop\r\nthe locomotive, the armature circuit was opened by the main switch,\r\nstopping the flow of current, and then brakes were applied by long\r\nlevers. Matters generally and the motors in particular went much better,\r\neven if the locomotive was so freely festooned with resistance-boxes\r\nall of perceptible weight and occupying much of the limited space. These\r\ndetails show forcibly and typically the painful steps of advance that\r\nevery inventor in this new field had to make in the effort to reach not\r\nalone commercial practicability, but mechanical feasibility. It was all\r\nempirical enough; but that was the only way open even to the highest\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\nSmugglers landing laces and silks have been known to wind them around\r\ntheir bodies, as being less ostentatious than carrying them in a trunk.\r\nEdison thought his resistance-boxes an equally superfluous display, and\r\ntherefore ingeniously wound some copper resistance wire around one of\r\nthe legs of the motor field magnet, where it was out of the way, served\r\nas a useful extra field coil in starting up the motor, and dismissed\r\nmost of the boxes back to the laboratory--a few being retained under the\r\nseat for chance emergencies. Like the boxes, this coil was in series\r\nwith the armature, and subject to plugging in and out at will by the\r\nmotorman. Thus equipped, the locomotive was found quite satisfactory,\r\nand long did yeoman service. It was given three cars to pull, one an\r\nopen awning-car with two park benches placed back to back; one a flat\r\nfreight-car, and one box-car dubbed the \"Pullman,\" with which Edison\r\nillustrated a system of electric braking. Although work had been begun\r\nso early in the year, and the road had been operating since May, it was\r\nnot until July that Edison executed any application for patents on his\r\n\"electromagnetic railway engine,\" or his ingenious braking system. Every\r\ninventor knows how largely his fate lies in the hands of a competent and\r\nalert patent attorney, in both the preparation and the prosecution\r\nof his case; and Mr. Sprague is justified in observing in his Century\r\narticle: \"The paucity of controlling claims obtained in these early\r\npatents is remarkable.\" It is notorious that Edison did not then enjoy\r\nthe skilful aid in safeguarding his ideas that he commanded later.\r\n\r\nThe daily newspapers and technical journals lost no time in bringing the\r\nroad to public attention, and the New York Herald of June 25th was swift\r\nto suggest that here was the locomotive that would be \"most pleasing to\r\nthe average New Yorker, whose head has ached with noise, whose eyes have\r\nbeen filled with dust, or whose clothes have been ruined with oil.\" A\r\ncouple of days later, the Daily Graphic illustrated and described\r\nthe road and published a sketch of a one-hundred-horse-power electric\r\nlocomotive for the use of the Pennsylvania Railroad between Perth Amboy\r\nand Rahway. Visitors, of course, were numerous, including many curious,\r\nsceptical railroad managers, few if any of whom except Villard could\r\nsee the slightest use for the new motive power. There is, perhaps,\r\nsome excuse for such indifference. No men in the world have more new\r\ninventions brought to them than railroad managers, and this was the\r\nrankest kind of novelty. It was not, indeed, until a year later, in\r\nMay, 1881, that the first regular road collecting fares was put in\r\noperation--a little stretch of one and a half miles from Berlin to\r\nLichterfelde, with one miniature motorcar. Edison was in reality doing\r\nsome heavy electric-railway engineering, his apparatus full of ideas,\r\nsuggestions, prophecies; but to the operators of long trunk lines it\r\nmust have seemed utterly insignificant and \"excellent fooling.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this situation, Mr. Edison says: \"One day Frank Thomson,\r\nthe President of the Pennsylvania Railroad, came out to see the electric\r\nlight and the electric railway in operation. The latter was then about\r\na mile long. He rode on it. At that time I was getting out plans to\r\nmake an electric locomotive of three hundred horse-power with six-foot\r\ndrivers, with the idea of showing people that they could dispense with\r\ntheir steam locomotives. Mr. Thomson made the objection that it was\r\nimpracticable, and that it would be impossible to supplant steam. His\r\ngreat experience and standing threw a wet blanket on my hopes. But\r\nI thought he might perhaps be mistaken, as there had been many such\r\ninstances on record. I continued to work on the plans, and about three\r\nyears later I started to build the locomotive at the works at Goerck\r\nStreet, and had it about finished when I was switched off on some other\r\nwork. One of the reasons why I felt the electric railway to be eminently\r\npractical was that Henry Villard, the President of the Northern Pacific,\r\nsaid that one of the greatest things that could be done would be to\r\nbuild right-angle feeders into the wheat-fields of Dakota and bring in\r\nthe wheat to the main lines, as the farmers then had to draw it from\r\nforty to eighty miles. There was a point where it would not pay to\r\nraise it at all; and large areas of the country were thus of no value.\r\nI conceived the idea of building a very light railroad of narrow gauge,\r\nand had got all the data as to the winds on the plains, and found that\r\nit would be possible with very large windmills to supply enough power to\r\ndrive those wheat trains.\"\r\n\r\nAmong others who visited the little road at this juncture were persons\r\ninterested in the Manhattan Elevated system of New York, on which\r\nexperiments were repeatedly tried later, but which was not destined\r\nto adopt a method so obviously well suited to all the conditions until\r\nafter many successful demonstrations had been made on elevated roads\r\nelsewhere. It must be admitted that Mr. Edison was not very profoundly\r\nimpressed with the desire entertained in that quarter to utilize any\r\nimprovement, for he remarks: \"When the Elevated Railroad in New York, up\r\nSixth Avenue, was started there was a great clamor about the noise, and\r\ninjunctions were threatened. The management engaged me to make a report\r\non the cause of the noise. I constructed an instrument that would record\r\nthe sound, and set out to make a preliminary report, but I found that\r\nthey never intended to do anything but let the people complain.\"\r\n\r\nIt was upon the co-operation of Villard that Edison fell back, and an\r\nagreement was entered into between them on September 14, 1881, which\r\nprovided that the latter would \"build two and a half miles of electric\r\nrailway at Menlo Park, equipped with three cars, two locomotives, one\r\nfor freight, and one for passengers, capacity of latter sixty miles an\r\nhour. Capacity freight engine, ten tons net freight; cost of handling\r\na ton of freight per mile per horse-power to be less than ordinary\r\nlocomotive.... If experiments are successful, Villard to pay actual\r\noutlay in experiments, and to treat with the Light Company for the\r\ninstallation of at least fifty miles of electric railroad in the wheat\r\nregions.\" Mr. Edison is authority for the statement that Mr. Villard\r\nadvanced between $35,000 and $40,000, and that the work done was very\r\nsatisfactory; but it did not end at that time in any practical results,\r\nas the Northern Pacific went into the hands of a receiver, and Mr.\r\nVillard's ability to help was hopelessly crippled. The directors of the\r\nEdison Electric Light Company could not be induced to have anything\r\nto do with the electric railway, and Mr. Insull states that the money\r\nadvanced was treated by Mr. Edison as a personal loan and repaid to\r\nMr. Villard, for whom he had a high admiration and a strong feeling\r\nof attachment. Mr. Insull says: \"Among the financial men whose close\r\npersonal friendship Edison enjoyed, I would mention Henry Villard, who,\r\nI think, had a higher appreciation of the possibilities of the Edison\r\nsystem than probably any other man of his time in Wall Street. He\r\ndropped out of the business at the time of the consolidation of the\r\nThomson-Houston Company with the Edison General Electric Company; but\r\nfrom the earliest days of the business, when it was in its experimental\r\nperiod, when the Edison light and power system was but an idea, down\r\nto the day of his death, Henry Villard continued a strong supporter not\r\nonly with his influence, but with his money. He was the first capitalist\r\nto back individually Edison's experiments in electric railways.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of his relationships with Mr. Villard at this time, Edison\r\nsays: \"When Villard was all broken down, and in a stupor caused by his\r\ndisasters in connection with the Northern Pacific, Mrs. Villard sent for\r\nme to come and cheer him up. It was very difficult to rouse him from his\r\ndespair and apathy, but I talked about the electric light to him, and\r\nits development, and told him that it would help him win it all back and\r\nput him in his former position. Villard made his great rally; he made\r\nmoney out of the electric light; and he got back control of the Northern\r\nPacific. Under no circumstances can a hustler be kept down. If he is\r\nonly square, he is bound to get back on his feet. Villard has often been\r\nblamed and severely criticised, but he was not the only one to blame.\r\nHis engineers had spent $20,000,000 too much in building the road, and\r\nit was not his fault if he found himself short of money, and at that\r\ntime unable to raise any more.\"\r\n\r\nVillard maintained his intelligent interest in electric-railway\r\ndevelopment, with regard to which Edison remarks: \"At one time Mr.\r\nVillard got the idea that he would run the mountain division of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad by electricity. He asked me if it could be\r\ndone. I said: 'Certainly, it is too easy for me to undertake; let some\r\none else do it.' He said: 'I want you to tackle the problem,' and\r\nhe insisted on it. So I got up a scheme of a third rail and shoe and\r\nerected it in my yard here in Orange. When I got it all ready, he had\r\nall his division engineers come on to New York, and they came over here.\r\nI showed them my plans, and the unanimous decision of the engineers was\r\nthat it was absolutely and utterly impracticable. That system is on the\r\nNew York Central now, and was also used on the New Haven road in its\r\nfirst work with electricity.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point it may be well to cite some other statements of Edison as\r\nto kindred work, with which he has not usually been associated in the\r\npublic mind. \"In the same manner I had worked out for the Manhattan\r\nElevated Railroad a system of electric trains, and had the control of\r\neach car centred at one place--multiple control. This was afterward\r\nworked out and made practical by Frank Sprague. I got up a slot contact\r\nfor street railways, and have a patent on it--a sliding contact in a\r\nslot. Edward Lauterbach was connected with the Third Avenue Railroad in\r\nNew York--as counsel--and I told him he was making a horrible mistake\r\nputting in the cable. I told him to let the cable stand still and send\r\nelectricity through it, and he would not have to move hundreds of tons\r\nof metal all the time. He would rue the day when he put the cable in.\"\r\nIt cannot be denied that the prophecy was fulfilled, for the cable was\r\nthe beginning of the frightful financial collapse of the system, and was\r\ntorn out in a few years to make way for the triumphant \"trolley in the\r\nslot.\"\r\n\r\nIncidental glimpses of this work are both amusing and interesting.\r\nHughes, who was working on the experimental road with Mr. Edison,\r\ntells the following story: \"Villard sent J. C. Henderson, one of his\r\nmechanical engineers, to see the road when it was in operation, and we\r\nwent down one day--Edison, Henderson, and I--and went on the locomotive.\r\nEdison ran it, and just after we started there was a trestle sixty feet\r\nlong and seven feet deep, and Edison put on all the power. When we went\r\nover it we must have been going forty miles an hour, and I could see the\r\nperspiration come out on Henderson. After we got over the trestle and\r\nstarted on down the track, Henderson said: 'When we go back I will walk.\r\nIf there is any more of that kind of running I won't be in it myself.'\"\r\nTo the correspondence of Grosvenor P. Lowrey we are indebted for a\r\nsimilar reminiscence, under date of June 5, 1880: \"Goddard and I have\r\nspent a part of the day at Menlo, and all is glorious. I have ridden at\r\nforty miles an hour on Mr. Edison's electric railway--and we ran off the\r\ntrack. I protested at the rate of speed over the sharp curves, designed\r\nto show the power of the engine, but Edison said they had done it often.\r\nFinally, when the last trip was to be taken, I said I did not like\r\nit, but would go along. The train jumped the track on a short curve,\r\nthrowing Kruesi, who was driving the engine, with his face down in the\r\ndirt, and another man in a comical somersault through some underbrush.\r\nEdison was off in a minute, jumping and laughing, and declaring it a\r\nmost beautiful accident. Kruesi got up, his face bleeding and a good\r\ndeal shaken; and I shall never forget the expression of voice and face\r\nin which he said, with some foreign accent: 'Oh! yes, pairfeckly safe.'\r\nFortunately no other hurts were suffered, and in a few minutes we had\r\nthe train on the track and running again.\"\r\n\r\nAll this rough-and-ready dealing with grades and curves was not mere\r\nhorse-play, but had a serious purpose underlying it, every trip having\r\nits record as to some feature of defect or improvement. One particular\r\nset of experiments relating to such work was made on behalf of visitors\r\nfrom South America, and were doubtless the first tests of the kind made\r\nfor that continent, where now many fine electric street and interurban\r\nrailway systems are in operation. Mr. Edison himself supplies the\r\nfollowing data: \"During the electric-railway experiments at Menlo Park,\r\nwe had a short spur of track up one of the steep gullies. The experiment\r\ncame about in this way. Bogota, the capital of Columbia, is reached on\r\nmuleback--or was--from Honda on the headwaters of the Magdalena River.\r\nThere were parties who wanted to know if transportation over the mule\r\nroute could not be done by electricity. They said the grades were\r\nexcessive, and it would cost too much to do it with steam locomotives,\r\neven if they could climb the grades. I said: 'Well, it can't be much\r\nmore than 45 per cent.; we will try that first. If it will do that it\r\nwill do anything else.' I started at 45 per cent. I got up an electric\r\nlocomotive with a grip on the rail by which it went up the 45 per cent.\r\ngrade. Then they said the curves were very short. I put the curves in.\r\nWe started the locomotive with nobody on it, and got up to twenty miles\r\nan hour, taking those curves of very short radius; but it was weeks\r\nbefore we could prevent it from running off. We had to bank the tracks\r\nup to an angle of thirty degrees before we could turn the curve and stay\r\non. These Spanish parties were perfectly satisfied we could put in\r\nan electric railway from Honda to Bogota successfully, and then they\r\ndisappeared. I have never seen them since. As usual, I paid for the\r\nexperiment.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1883 the Electric Railway Company of America was\r\nincorporated in the State of New York with a capital of $2,000,000 to\r\ndevelop the patents and inventions of Edison and Stephen D. Field,\r\nto the latter of whom the practical work of active development was\r\nconfided, and in June of the same year an exhibit was made at the\r\nChicago Railway Exposition, which attracted attention throughout\r\nthe country, and did much to stimulate the growing interest in\r\nelectric-railway work. With the aid of Messrs. F. B. Rae, C. L. Healy,\r\nand C. O. Mailloux a track and locomotive were constructed for the\r\ncompany by Mr. Field and put in service in the gallery of the main\r\nexhibition building. The track curved sharply at either end on a radius\r\nof fifty-six feet, and the length was about one-third of a mile. The\r\nlocomotive named \"The Judge,\" after Justice Field, an uncle of Stephen\r\nD. Field, took current from a central rail between the two outer rails,\r\nthat were the return circuit, the contact being a rubbing wire brush on\r\neach side of the \"third rail,\" answering the same purpose as the contact\r\nshoe of later date. The locomotive weighed three tons, was twelve feet\r\nlong, five feet wide, and made a speed of nine miles an hour with a\r\ntrailer car for passengers. Starting on June 5th, when the exhibition\r\nclosed on June 23d this tiny but typical road had operated for over 118\r\nhours, had made over 446 miles, and had carried 26,805 passengers. After\r\nthe exposition closed the outfit was taken during the same year to\r\nthe exposition at Louisville, Kentucky, where it was also successful,\r\ncarrying a large number of passengers. It deserves note that at Chicago\r\nregular railway tickets were issued to paying passengers, the first ever\r\nemployed on American electric railways.\r\n\r\nWith this modest but brilliant demonstration, to which the illustrious\r\nnames of Edison and Field were attached, began the outburst of\r\nexcitement over electric railways, very much like the eras of\r\nspeculation and exploitation that attended only a few years earlier\r\nthe introduction of the telephone and the electric light, but with such\r\nsignificant results that the capitalization of electric roads in America\r\nis now over $4,000,000,000, or twice as much as that of the other two\r\narts combined. There was a tremendous rush into the electric-railway\r\nfield after 1883, and an outburst of inventive activity that has rarely,\r\nif ever, been equalled. It is remarkable that, except Siemens, no\r\nEuropean achieved fame in this early work, while from America the ideas\r\nand appliances of Edison, Van Depoele, Sprague, Field, Daft, and Short\r\nhave been carried and adopted all over the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison was consulting electrician for the Electric Railway Company,\r\nbut neither a director nor an executive officer. Just what the trouble\r\nwas as to the internal management of the corporation it is hard to\r\ndetermine a quarter of a century later; but it was equipped with all\r\nessential elements to dominate an art in which after its first efforts\r\nit remained practically supine and useless, while other interests\r\nforged ahead and reaped both the profit and the glory. Dissensions arose\r\nbetween the representatives of the Field and Edison interests, and\r\nin April, 1890, the Railway Company assigned its rights to the Edison\r\npatents to the Edison General Electric Company, recently formed by\r\nthe consolidation of all the branches of the Edison light, power, and\r\nmanufacturing industry under one management. The only patent rights\r\nremaining to the Railway Company were those under three Field patents,\r\none of which, with controlling claims, was put in suit June, 1890,\r\nagainst the Jamaica & Brooklyn Road Company, a customer of the Edison\r\nGeneral Electric Company. This was, to say the least, a curious and\r\nanomalous situation. Voluminous records were made by both parties to\r\nthe suit, and in the spring of 1894 the case was argued before the\r\nlate Judge Townsend, who wrote a long opinion dismissing the bill of\r\ncomplaint. [15] The student will find therein a very complete and\r\ncareful study of the early electric-railway art. After this decision was\r\nrendered, the Electric Railway Company remained for several years in a\r\nmoribund condition, and on the last day of 1896 its property was placed\r\nin the hands of a receiver. In February of 1897 the receiver sold the\r\nthree Field patents to their original owner, and he in turn sold them to\r\nthe Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. The Railway Company\r\nthen went into voluntary dissolution, a sad example of failure to seize\r\nthe opportunity at the psychological moment, and on the part of the\r\ninventor to secure any adequate return for years of effort and struggle\r\nin founding one of the great arts. Neither of these men was squelched by\r\nsuch a calamitous result, but if there were not something of bitterness\r\nin their feelings as they survey what has come of their work, they would\r\nnot be human.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Edison retained a very lively interest in\r\nelectric-railway progress long after the pregnant days at Menlo Park,\r\none of the best evidences of which is an article in the New York\r\nElectrical Engineer of November 18, 1891, which describes some important\r\nand original experiments in the direction of adapting electrical\r\nconditions to the larger cities. The overhead trolley had by that time\r\nbegun its victorious career, but there was intense hostility displayed\r\ntoward it in many places because of the inevitable increase in the\r\nnumber of overhead wires, which, carrying, as they did, a current of\r\nhigh voltage and large quantity, were regarded as a menace to life and\r\nproperty. Edison has always manifested a strong objection to overhead\r\nwires in cities, and urged placing them underground; and the outcry\r\nagainst the overhead \"deadly\" trolley met with his instant sympathy.\r\nHis study of the problem brought him to the development of the modern\r\n\"substation,\" although the twists that later evolutions have given the\r\nidea have left it scarcely recognizable.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 15: See 61 Fed. Rep. 655.]\r\n\r\nMr. Villard, as President of the Edison General Electric Company,\r\nrequested Mr. Edison, as electrician of the company, to devise a\r\nstreet-railway system which should be applicable to the largest cities\r\nwhere the use of the trolley would not be permitted, where the slot\r\nconduit system would not be used, and where, in general, the details of\r\nconstruction should be reduced to the simplest form. The limits imposed\r\npractically were such as to require that the system should not cost more\r\nthan a cable road to install. Edison reverted to his ingenious lighting\r\nplan of years earlier, and thus settled on a method by which\r\ncurrent should be conveyed from the power plant at high potential to\r\nmotor-generators placed below the ground in close proximity to the\r\nrails. These substations would convert the current received at a\r\npressure of, say, one thousand volts to one of twenty volts available\r\nbetween rail and rail, with a corresponding increase in the volume of\r\nthe current. With the utilization of heavy currents at low voltage it\r\nbecame necessary, of course, to devise apparatus which should be able to\r\npick up with absolute certainty one thousand amperes of current at\r\nthis pressure through two inches of mud, if necessary. With his wonted\r\nactivity and fertility Edison set about devising such a contact, and\r\nexperimented with metal wheels under all conditions of speed and track\r\nconditions. It was several months before he could convey one hundred\r\namperes by means of such contacts, but he worked out at last a\r\nsatisfactory device which was equal to the task. The next point was\r\nto secure a joint between contiguous rails such as would permit of\r\nthe passage of several thousand amperes without introducing undue\r\nresistance. This was also accomplished.\r\n\r\nObjections were naturally made to rails out in the open on the street\r\nsurface carrying large currents at a potential of twenty volts. It was\r\nsaid that vehicles with iron wheels passing over the tracks and spanning\r\nthe two rails would short-circuit the current, \"chew\" themselves up,\r\nand destroy the dynamos generating the current by choking all that\r\ntremendous amount of energy back into them. Edison tackled the objection\r\nsquarely and short-circuited his track with such a vehicle, but\r\nsucceeded in getting only about two hundred amperes through the wheels,\r\nthe low voltage and the insulating properties of the axle-grease being\r\nsufficient to account for such a result. An iron bar was also used,\r\npolished, and with a man standing on it to insure solid contact; but\r\nonly one thousand amperes passed through it--i.e., the amount required\r\nby a single car, and, of course, much less than the capacity of the\r\ngenerators able to operate a system of several hundred cars.\r\n\r\nFurther interesting experiments showed that the expected large leakage\r\nof current from the rails in wet weather did not materialize. Edison\r\nfound that under the worst conditions with a wet and salted track, at a\r\npotential difference of twenty volts between the two rails, the\r\nextreme loss was only two and one-half horse-power. In this respect the\r\nphenomenon followed the same rule as that to which telegraph wires are\r\nsubject--namely, that the loss of insulation is greater in damp, murky\r\nweather when the insulators are covered with wet dust than during heavy\r\nrains when the insulators are thoroughly washed by the action of the\r\nwater. In like manner a heavy rain-storm cleaned the tracks from\r\nthe accumulations due chiefly to the droppings of the horses, which\r\notherwise served largely to increase the conductivity. Of course, in dry\r\nweather the loss of current was practically nothing, and, under ordinary\r\nconditions, Edison held, his system was in respect to leakage and the\r\nproblems of electrolytic attack of the current on adjacent pipes, etc.,\r\nas fully insulated as the standard trolley network of the day. The cost\r\nof his system Mr. Edison placed at from $30,000 to $100,000 per mile of\r\ndouble track, in accordance with local conditions, and in this respect\r\ncomparing very favorably with the cable systems then so much in favor\r\nfor heavy traffic. All the arguments that could be urged in support of\r\nthis ingenious system are tenable and logical at the present moment; but\r\nthe trolley had its way except on a few lines where the conduit-and-shoe\r\nmethod was adopted; and in the intervening years the volume of traffic\r\ncreated and handled by electricity in centres of dense population has\r\nbrought into existence the modern subway.\r\n\r\nBut down to the moment of the preparation of this biography, Edison has\r\nretained an active interest in transportation problems, and his latest\r\nwork has been that of reviving the use of the storage battery for\r\nstreet-car purposes. At one time there were a number of storage-battery\r\nlines and cars in operation in such cities as Washington, New York,\r\nChicago, and Boston; but the costs of operation and maintenance\r\nwere found to be inordinately high as compared with those of the\r\ndirect-supply methods, and the battery cars all disappeared. The need\r\nfor them under many conditions remained, as, for example, in places\r\nin Greater New York where the overhead trolley wires are forbidden as\r\nobjectionable, and where the ground is too wet or too often submerged\r\nto permit of the conduit with the slot. Some of the roads in Greater\r\nNew York have been anxious to secure such cars, and, as usual, the most\r\nresourceful electrical engineer and inventor of his times has made\r\nthe effort. A special experimental track has been laid at the Orange\r\nlaboratory, and a car equipped with the Edison storage battery and other\r\ndevices has been put under severe and extended trial there and in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nMenlo Park, in ruin and decay, affords no traces of the early Edison\r\nelectric-railway work, but the crude little locomotive built by Charles\r\nT. Hughes was rescued from destruction, and has become the property\r\nof the Pratt Institute, of Brooklyn, to whose thousands of technical\r\nstudents it is a constant example and incentive. It was loaned in 1904\r\nto the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies, and by it exhibited\r\nas part of the historical Edison collection at the St. Louis Exposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC ORE MILLING WORK\r\n\r\nDURING the Hudson-Fulton celebration of October, 1909, Burgomaster Van\r\nLeeuwen, of Amsterdam, member of the delegation sent officially from\r\nHolland to escort the Half Moon and participate in the functions of the\r\nanniversary, paid a visit to the Edison laboratory at Orange to see\r\nthe inventor, who may be regarded as pre-eminent among those of Dutch\r\ndescent in this country. Found, as usual, hard at work--this time on his\r\ncement house, of which he showed the iron molds--Edison took occasion to\r\nremark that if he had achieved anything worth while, it was due to the\r\nobstinacy and pertinacity he had inherited from his forefathers.\r\nTo which it may be added that not less equally have the nature\r\nof inheritance and the quality of atavism been exhibited in his\r\nextraordinary predilection for the miller's art. While those Batavian\r\nancestors on the low shores of the Zuyder Zee devoted their energies to\r\ngrinding grain, he has been not less assiduous than they in reducing the\r\nrocks of the earth itself to flour.\r\n\r\nAlthough this phase of Mr. Edison's diverse activities is not as\r\ngenerally known to the world as many others of a more popular character,\r\nthe milling of low-grade auriferous ores and the magnetic separation of\r\niron ores have been subjects of engrossing interest and study to him for\r\nmany years. Indeed, his comparatively unknown enterprise of separating\r\nmagnetically and putting into commercial form low-grade iron ore,\r\nas carried on at Edison, New Jersey, proved to be the most colossal\r\nexperiment that he has ever made.\r\n\r\nIf a person qualified to judge were asked to answer categorically as to\r\nwhether or not that enterprise was a failure, he could truthfully answer\r\nboth yes and no. Yes, in that circumstances over which Mr. Edison had no\r\ncontrol compelled the shutting down of the plant at the very moment of\r\nsuccess; and no, in that the mechanically successful and commercially\r\npractical results obtained, after the exercise of stupendous efforts\r\nand the expenditure of a fortune, are so conclusive that they must\r\ninevitably be the reliance of many future iron-masters. In other words,\r\nMr. Edison was at least a quarter of a century ahead of the times in the\r\nwork now to be considered.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to a specific description of this remarkable\r\nenterprise, however, let us glance at an early experiment in separating\r\nmagnetic iron sands on the Atlantic sea-shore: \"Some years ago I heard\r\none day that down at Quogue, Long Island, there were immense deposits\r\nof black magnetic sand. This would be very valuable if the iron could\r\nbe separated from the sand. So I went down to Quogue with one of my\r\nassistants and saw there for miles large beds of black sand on the beach\r\nin layers from one to six inches thick--hundreds of thousands of tons.\r\nMy first thought was that it would be a very easy matter to concentrate\r\nthis, and I found I could sell the stuff at a good price. I put up a\r\nsmall plant, but just as I got it started a tremendous storm came\r\nup, and every bit of that black sand went out to sea. During the\r\ntwenty-eight years that have intervened it has never come back.\" This\r\nincident was really the prelude to the development set forth in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nIn the early eighties Edison became familiar with the fact that the\r\nEastern steel trade was suffering a disastrous change, and that business\r\nwas slowly drifting westward, chiefly by reason of the discovery and\r\nopening up of enormous deposits of high-grade iron ore in the upper\r\npeninsula of Michigan. This ore could be excavated very cheaply by\r\nmeans of improved mining facilities, and transported at low cost to lake\r\nports. Hence the iron and steel mills east of the Alleghanies--compelled\r\nto rely on limited local deposits of Bessemer ore, and upon foreign\r\nores which were constantly rising in value--began to sustain a serious\r\ncompetition with Western mills, even in Eastern markets.\r\n\r\nLong before this situation arose, it had been recognized by Eastern\r\niron-masters that sooner or later the deposits of high-grade ore would\r\nbe exhausted, and, in consequence, there would ensue a compelling\r\nnecessity to fall back on the low-grade magnetic ores. For many years it\r\nhad been a much-discussed question how to make these ores available\r\nfor transportation to distant furnaces. To pay railroad charges on\r\nores carrying perhaps 80 to 90 per cent. of useless material would\r\nbe prohibitive. Hence the elimination of the worthless \"gangue\" by\r\nconcentration of the iron particles associated with it, seemed to be the\r\nonly solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nMany attempts had been made in by-gone days to concentrate the iron in\r\nsuch ores by water processes, but with only a partial degree of success.\r\nThe impossibility of obtaining a uniform concentrate was a most serious\r\nobjection, had there not indeed been other difficulties which rendered\r\nthis method commercially impracticable. It is quite natural, therefore,\r\nthat the idea of magnetic separation should have occurred to many\r\ninventors. Thus we find numerous instances throughout the last century\r\nof experiments along this line; and particularly in the last forty or\r\nfifty years, during which various attempts have been made by others than\r\nEdison to perfect magnetic separation and bring it up to something like\r\ncommercial practice. At the time he took up the matter, however, no\r\none seems to have realized the full meaning of the tremendous problems\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nFrom 1880 to 1885, while still very busy in the development of his\r\nelectric-light system, Edison found opportunity to plan crushing and\r\nseparating machinery. His first patent on the subject was applied for\r\nand issued early in 1880. He decided, after mature deliberation, that\r\nthe magnetic separation of low-grade ores on a colossal scale at a low\r\ncost was the only practical way of supplying the furnace-man with a high\r\nquality of iron ore. It was his opinion that it was cheaper to quarry\r\nand concentrate lean ore in a big way than to attempt to mine, under\r\nadverse circumstances, limited bodies of high-grade ore. He appreciated\r\nfully the serious nature of the gigantic questions involved; and his\r\nplans were laid with a view to exercising the utmost economy in the\r\ndesign and operation of the plant in which he contemplated the automatic\r\nhandling of many thousands of tons of material daily. It may be stated\r\nas broadly true that Edison engineered to handle immense masses of stuff\r\nautomatically, while his predecessors aimed chiefly at close separation.\r\n\r\nReduced to its barest, crudest terms, the proposition of magnetic\r\nseparation is simplicity itself. A piece of the ore (magnetite) may be\r\nreduced to powder and the ore particles separated therefrom by the help\r\nof a simple hand magnet. To elucidate the basic principle of Edison's\r\nmethod, let the crushed ore fall in a thin stream past such a magnet.\r\nThe magnetic particles are attracted out of the straight line of the\r\nfalling stream, and being heavy, gravitate inwardly and fall to one\r\nside of a partition placed below. The non-magnetic gangue descends in\r\na straight line to the other side of the partition. Thus a complete\r\nseparation is effected.\r\n\r\nSimple though the principle appears, it was in its application to vast\r\nmasses of material and in the solving of great engineering problems\r\nconnected therewith that Edison's originality made itself manifest in\r\nthe concentrating works that he established in New Jersey, early in the\r\nnineties. Not only did he develop thoroughly the refining of the crushed\r\nore, so that after it had passed the four hundred and eighty magnets\r\nin the mill, the concentrates came out finally containing 91 to 93 per\r\ncent. of iron oxide, but he also devised collateral machinery, methods\r\nand processes all fundamental in their nature. These are too numerous to\r\nspecify in detail, as they extended throughout the various ramifications\r\nof the plant, but the principal ones are worthy of mention, such as:\r\n\r\n     The giant rolls (for crushing).\r\n     Intermediate rolls.\r\n     Three-high rolls.\r\n     Giant cranes (215 feet long span).\r\n     Vertical dryer.\r\n     Belt conveyors.\r\n     Air separation.\r\n     Mechanical separation of phosphorus.\r\n     Briquetting.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Edison's work was appreciated at the time is made evident\r\nby the following extract from an article describing the Edison\r\nplant, published in The Iron Age of October 28, 1897; in which, after\r\nmentioning his struggle with adverse conditions, it says: \"There is very\r\nlittle that is showy, from the popular point of view, in the gigantic\r\nwork which Mr. Edison has done during these years, but to those who are\r\ncapable of grasping the difficulties encountered, Mr. Edison appears\r\nin the new light of a brilliant constructing engineer grappling with\r\ntechnical and commercial problems of the highest order. His genius as\r\nan inventor is revealed in many details of the great concentrating\r\nplant.... But to our mind, originality of the highest type as a\r\nconstructor and designer appears in the bold way in which he sweeps\r\naside accepted practice in this particular field and attains results not\r\nhitherto approached. He pursues methods in ore-dressing at which\r\nthose who are trained in the usual practice may well stand aghast.\r\nBut considering the special features of the problems to be solved, his\r\nmethods will be accepted as those economically wise and expedient.\"\r\n\r\nA cursory glance at these problems will reveal their import. Mountains\r\nmust be reduced to dust; all this dust must be handled in detail, so\r\nto speak, and from it must be separated the fine particles of iron\r\nconstituting only one-fourth or one-fifth of its mass; and then this\r\niron-ore dust must be put into such shape that it could be\r\ncommercially shipped and used. One of the most interesting and striking\r\ninvestigations made by Edison in this connection is worthy of note,\r\nand may be related in his own words: \"I felt certain that there must be\r\nlarge bodies of magnetite in the East, which if crushed and concentrated\r\nwould satisfy the wants of the Eastern furnaces for steel-making.\r\nHaving determined to investigate the mountain regions of New Jersey, I\r\nconstructed a very sensitive magnetic needle, which would dip toward the\r\nearth if brought over any considerable body of magnetic iron ore. One\r\nof my laboratory assistants went out with me and we visited many of the\r\nmines of New Jersey, but did not find deposits of any magnitude.\r\nOne day, however, as we drove over a mountain range, not known as\r\niron-bearing land, I was astonished to find that the needle was strongly\r\nattracted and remained so; thus indicating that the whole mountain was\r\nunderlaid with vast bodies of magnetic ore.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it was a commercial problem to produce high-grade Bessemer ore\r\nfrom these deposits, and took steps to acquire a large amount of the\r\nproperty. I also planned a great magnetic survey of the East, and I\r\nbelieve it remains the most comprehensive of its kind yet performed. I\r\nhad a number of men survey a strip reaching from Lower Canada to North\r\nCarolina. The only instrument we used was the special magnetic needle.\r\nWe started in Lower Canada and travelled across the line of march\r\ntwenty-five miles; then advanced south one thousand feet; then back\r\nacross the line of march again twenty-five miles; then south another\r\nthousand feet, across again, and so on. Thus we advanced all the way to\r\nNorth Carolina, varying our cross-country march from two to twenty-five\r\nmiles, according to geological formation. Our magnetic needle indicated\r\nthe presence and richness of the invisible deposits of magnetic ore.\r\nWe kept minute records of these indications, and when the survey was\r\nfinished we had exact information of the deposits in every part of\r\neach State we had passed through. We also knew the width, length, and\r\napproximate depth of every one of these deposits, which were enormous.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of ore disclosed by this survey was simply fabulous. How\r\nmuch so may be judged from the fact that in the three thousand acres\r\nimmediately surrounding the mills that I afterward established at\r\nEdison there were over 200,000,000 tons of low-grade ore. I also secured\r\nsixteen thousand acres in which the deposit was proportionately as\r\nlarge. These few acres alone contained sufficient ore to supply the\r\nwhole United States iron trade, including exports, for seventy years.\"\r\n\r\nGiven a mountain of rock containing only one-fifth to one-fourth\r\nmagnetic iron, the broad problem confronting Edison resolved itself into\r\nthree distinct parts--first, to tear down the mountain bodily and grind\r\nit to powder; second, to extract from this powder the particles of iron\r\nmingled in its mass; and, third, to accomplish these results at a cost\r\nsufficiently low to give the product a commercial value.\r\n\r\nEdison realized from the start that the true solution of this problem\r\nlay in the continuous treatment of the material, with the maximum\r\nemployment of natural forces and the minimum of manual labor and\r\ngenerated power. Hence, all his conceptions followed this general\r\nprinciple so faithfully and completely that we find in the plant\r\nembodying his ideas the forces of momentum and gravity steadily in\r\nharness and keeping the traces taut; while there was no touch of the\r\nhuman hand upon the material from the beginning of the treatment to its\r\nfinish--the staff being employed mainly to keep watch on the correct\r\nworking of the various processes.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to devote space to the beginnings of the\r\nenterprise, although they are full of interest. They served, however, to\r\nconvince Edison that if he ever expected to carry out his scheme on the\r\nextensive scale planned, he could not depend upon the market to supply\r\nsuitable machinery for important operations, but would be obliged to\r\ndevise and build it himself. Thus, outside the steam-shovel and such\r\nstaple items as engines, boilers, dynamos, and motors, all of the\r\ndiverse and complex machinery of the entire concentrating plant, as\r\nsubsequently completed, was devised by him especially for the purpose.\r\nThe necessity for this was due to the many radical variations made from\r\naccepted methods.\r\n\r\nNo such departure was as radical as that of the method of crushing the\r\nore. Existing machinery for this purpose had been designed on the\r\nbasis of mining methods then in vogue, by which the rock was thoroughly\r\nshattered by means of high explosives and reduced to pieces of one\r\nhundred pounds or less. These pieces were then crushed by power directly\r\napplied. If a concentrating mill, planned to treat five or six thousand\r\ntons per day, were to be operated on this basis the investment in\r\ncrushers and the supply of power would be enormous, to say nothing of\r\nthe risk of frequent breakdowns by reason of multiplicity of machinery\r\nand parts. From a consideration of these facts, and with his usual\r\ntendency to upset traditional observances, Edison conceived the bold\r\nidea of constructing gigantic rolls which, by the force of momentum,\r\nwould be capable of crushing individual rocks of vastly greater size\r\nthan ever before attempted. He reasoned that the advantages thus\r\nobtained would be fourfold: a minimum of machinery and parts; greater\r\ncompactness; a saving of power; and greater economy in mining. As this\r\nlast-named operation precedes the crushing, let us first consider it as\r\nit was projected and carried on by him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps quarrying would be a better term than mining in this case, as\r\nEdison's plan was to approach the rock and tear it down bodily. The\r\nfaith that \"moves mountains\" had a new opportunity. In work of this\r\nnature it had been customary, as above stated, to depend upon a high\r\nexplosive, such as dynamite, to shatter and break the ore to lumps\r\nof one hundred pounds or less. This, however, he deemed to be a most\r\nuneconomical process, for energy stored as heat units in dynamite at\r\n$260 per ton was much more expensive than that of calories in a ton of\r\ncoal at $3 per ton. Hence, he believed that only the minimum of work\r\nshould be done with the costly explosive; and, therefore, planned to use\r\ndynamite merely to dislodge great masses of rock, and depended upon the\r\nsteam-shovel, operated by coal under the boiler, to displace, handle,\r\nand remove the rock in detail. This was the plan that was subsequently\r\nput into practice in the great works at Edison, New Jersey. A series of\r\nthree-inch holes twenty feet deep were drilled eight feet apart, about\r\ntwelve feet back of the ore-bank, and into these were inserted dynamite\r\ncartridges. The blast would dislodge thirty to thirty-five thousand tons\r\nof rock, which was scooped up by great steam-shovels and loaded on to\r\nskips carried by a line of cars on a narrow-gauge railroad running\r\nto and from the crushing mill. Here the material was automatically\r\ndelivered to the giant rolls. The problem included handling and crushing\r\nthe \"run of the mine,\" without selection. The steam-shovel did not\r\ndiscriminate, but picked up handily single pieces weighing five or six\r\ntons and loaded them on the skips with quantities of smaller lumps.\r\nWhen the skips arrived at the giant rolls, their contents were dumped\r\nautomatically into a superimposed hopper. The rolls were well named, for\r\nwith ear-splitting noise they broke up in a few seconds the great pieces\r\nof rock tossed in from the skips.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to appreciate to the full the daring exemplified in these\r\ngreat crushing rolls, or rather \"rock-crackers,\" without having watched\r\nthem in operation delivering their \"solar-plexus\" blows. It was only\r\nas one might stand in their vicinity and hear the thunderous roar\r\naccompanying the smashing and rending of the massive rocks as they\r\ndisappeared from view that the mind was overwhelmed with a sense of the\r\nmagnificent proportions of this operation. The enormous force exerted\r\nduring this process may be illustrated from the fact that during its\r\ndevelopment, in running one of the early forms of rolls, pieces of rock\r\nweighing more than half a ton would be shot up in the air to a height of\r\ntwenty or twenty-five feet.\r\n\r\nThe giant rolls were two solid cylinders, six feet in diameter and five\r\nfeet long, made of cast iron. To the faces of these rolls were bolted a\r\nseries of heavy, chilled-iron plates containing a number of projecting\r\nknobs two inches high. Each roll had also two rows of four-inch knobs,\r\nintended to strike a series of hammer-like blows. The rolls were set\r\nface to face fourteen inches apart, in a heavy frame, and the total\r\nweight was one hundred and thirty tons, of which seventy tons were in\r\nmoving parts. The space between these two rolls allowed pieces of rock\r\nmeasuring less than fourteen inches to descend to other smaller rolls\r\nplaced below. The giant rolls were belt-driven, in opposite directions,\r\nthrough friction clutches, although the belt was not depended upon for\r\nthe actual crushing. Previous to the dumping of a skip, the rolls were\r\nspeeded up to a circumferential velocity of nearly a mile a minute, thus\r\nimparting to them the terrific momentum that would break up easily in a\r\nfew seconds boulders weighing five or six tons each. It was as though a\r\nrock of this size had got in the way of two express trains travelling\r\nin opposite directions at nearly sixty miles an hour. In other words,\r\nit was the kinetic energy of the rolls that crumbled up the rocks with\r\npile-driver effect. This sudden strain might have tended to stop the\r\nengine driving the rolls; but by an ingenious clutch arrangement the\r\nbelt was released at the moment of resistance in the rolls by reason of\r\nthe rocks falling between them. The act of breaking and crushing would\r\nnaturally decrease the tremendous momentum, but after the rock was\r\nreduced and the pieces had passed through, the belt would again come\r\ninto play, and once more speed up the rolls for a repetition of their\r\nregular prize-fighter duty.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the giant rolls the rocks, having been reduced to pieces not\r\nlarger than fourteen inches, passed into the series of \"Intermediate\r\nRolls\" of similar construction and operation, by which they were still\r\nfurther reduced, and again passed on to three other sets of rolls\r\nof smaller dimensions. These latter rolls were also face-lined with\r\nchilled-iron plates; but, unlike the larger ones, were positively\r\ndriven, reducing the rock to pieces of about one-half-inch size, or\r\nsmaller. The whole crushing operation of reduction from massive boulders\r\nto small pebbly pieces having been done in less time than the telling\r\nhas occupied, the product was conveyed to the \"Dryer,\" a tower nine\r\nfeet square and fifty feet high, heated from below by great open furnace\r\nfires. All down the inside walls of this tower were placed cast-iron\r\nplates, nine feet long and seven inches wide, arranged alternately in\r\n\"fish-ladder\" fashion. The crushed rock, being delivered at the top,\r\nwould fall down from plate to plate, constantly exposing different\r\nsurfaces to the heat, until it landed completely dried in the lower\r\nportion of the tower, where it fell into conveyors which took it up to\r\nthe stock-house.\r\n\r\nThis method of drying was original with Edison. At the time this adjunct\r\nto the plant was required, the best dryer on the market was of a rotary\r\ntype, which had a capacity of only twenty tons per hour, with the\r\nexpenditure of considerable power. As Edison had determined upon\r\ntreating two hundred and fifty tons or more per hour, he decided to\r\ndevise an entirely new type of great capacity, requiring a minimum of\r\npower (for elevating the material), and depending upon the force of\r\ngravity for handling it during the drying process. A long series of\r\nexperiments resulted in the invention of the tower dryer with a capacity\r\nof three hundred tons per hour.\r\n\r\nThe rock, broken up into pieces about the size of marbles, having been\r\ndried and conveyed to the stock-house, the surplusage was automatically\r\ncarried out from the other end of the stock-house by conveyors, to\r\npass through the next process, by which it was reduced to a powder. The\r\nmachinery for accomplishing this result represents another interesting\r\nand radical departure of Edison from accepted usage. He had investigated\r\nall the crushing-machines on the market, and tried all he could get.\r\nHe found them all greatly lacking in economy of operation; indeed, the\r\nhighest results obtainable from the best were 18 per cent. of actual\r\nwork, involving a loss of 82 per cent. by friction. His nature revolted\r\nat such an immense loss of power, especially as he proposed the crushing\r\nof vast quantities of ore. Thus, he was obliged to begin again at the\r\nfoundation, and he devised a crushing-machine which was subsequently\r\nnamed the \"Three-High Rolls,\" and which practically reversed the above\r\nfigures, as it developed 84 per cent. of work done with only 16 per\r\ncent. loss in friction.\r\n\r\nA brief description of this remarkable machine will probably interest\r\nthe reader. In the two end pieces of a heavy iron frame were set three\r\nrolls, or cylinders--one in the centre, another below, and the other\r\nabove--all three being in a vertical line. These rolls were of cast\r\niron three feet in diameter, having chilled-iron smooth face-plates of\r\nconsiderable thickness. The lowest roll was set in a fixed bearing at\r\nthe bottom of the frame, and, therefore, could only turn around on its\r\naxis. The middle and top rolls were free to move up or down from and\r\ntoward the lower roll, and the shafts of the middle and upper rolls were\r\nset in a loose bearing which could slip up and down in the iron frame.\r\nIt will be apparent, therefore, that any material which passed in\r\nbetween the top and the middle rolls, and the middle and bottom rolls,\r\ncould be ground as fine as might be desired, depending entirely upon the\r\namount of pressure applied to the loose rolls. In operation the material\r\npassed first through the upper and middle rolls, and then between the\r\nmiddle and lowest rolls.\r\n\r\nThis pressure was applied in a most ingenious manner. On the ends of the\r\nshafts of the bottom and top rolls there were cylindrical sleeves, or\r\nbearings, having seven sheaves, in which was run a half-inch endless\r\nwire rope. This rope was wound seven times over the sheaves as above,\r\nand led upward and over a single-groove sheave which was operated by the\r\npiston of an air cylinder, and in this manner the pressure was applied\r\nto the rolls. It will be seen, therefore, that the system consisted in a\r\nsingle rope passed over sheaves and so arranged that it could be varied\r\nin length, thus providing for elasticity in exerting pressure and\r\nregulating it as desired. The efficiency of this system was incomparably\r\ngreater than that of any other known crusher or grinder, for while a\r\npressure of one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds could be exerted\r\nby these rolls, friction was almost entirely eliminated because the\r\nupper and lower roll bearings turned with the rolls and revolved in the\r\nwire rope, which constituted the bearing proper.\r\n\r\nThe same cautious foresight exercised by Edison in providing a safety\r\ndevice--the fuse--to prevent fires in his electric-light system, was\r\nagain displayed in this concentrating plant, where, to save possible\r\ninjury to its expensive operating parts, he devised an analogous factor,\r\nproviding all the crushing machinery with closely calculated \"safety\r\npins,\" which, on being overloaded, would shear off and thus stop the\r\nmachine at once.\r\n\r\nThe rocks having thus been reduced to fine powder, the mass was ready\r\nfor screening on its way to the magnetic separators. Here again Edison\r\nreversed prior practice by discarding rotary screens and devising a form\r\nof tower screen, which, besides having a very large working capacity\r\nby gravity, eliminated all power except that required to elevate the\r\nmaterial. The screening process allowed the finest part of the crushed\r\nrock to pass on, by conveyor belts, to the magnetic separators, while\r\nthe coarser particles were in like manner automatically returned to the\r\nrolls for further reduction.\r\n\r\nIn a narrative not intended to be strictly technical, it would probably\r\ntire the reader to follow this material in detail through the numerous\r\nsteps attending the magnetic separation. These may be seen in a\r\ndiagram reproduced from the above-named article in the Iron Age, and\r\nsupplemented by the following extract from the Electrical Engineer,\r\nNew York, October 28, 1897: \"At the start the weakest magnet at the top\r\nfrees the purest particles, and the second takes care of others; but the\r\nthird catches those to which rock adheres, and will extract particles\r\nof which only one-eighth is iron. This batch of material goes back for\r\nanother crushing, so that everything is subjected to an equality of\r\nrefining. We are now in sight of the real 'concentrates,' which are\r\nconveyed to dryer No. 2 for drying again, and are then delivered to\r\nthe fifty-mesh screens. Whatever is fine enough goes through to the\r\neight-inch magnets, and the remainder goes back for recrushing.\r\nBelow the eight-inch magnets the dust is blown out of the particles\r\nmechanically, and they then go to the four-inch magnets for final\r\ncleansing and separation.... Obviously, at each step the percentage of\r\nfelspar and phosphorus is less and less until in the final concentrates\r\nthe percentage of iron oxide is 91 to 93 per cent. As intimated at the\r\noutset, the tailings will be 75 per cent. of the rock taken from the\r\nveins of ore, so that every four tons of crude, raw, low-grade ore will\r\nhave yielded roughly one ton of high-grade concentrate and three tons of\r\nsand, the latter also having its value in various ways.\"\r\n\r\nThis sand was transported automatically by belt conveyors to the rear of\r\nthe works to be stored and sold. Being sharp, crystalline, and even in\r\nquality, it was a valuable by-product, finding a ready sale for\r\nbuilding purposes, railway sand-boxes, and various industrial uses. The\r\nconcentrate, in fine powdery form, was delivered in similar manner to a\r\nstock-house.\r\n\r\nAs to the next step in the process, we may now quote again from the\r\narticle in the Iron Age: \"While Mr. Edison and his associates were\r\nworking on the problem of cheap concentration of iron ore, an added\r\ndifficulty faced them in the preparation of the concentrates for the\r\nmarket. Furnacemen object to more than a very small proportion of fine\r\nore in their mixtures, particularly when the ore is magnetic, not easily\r\nreduced. The problem to be solved was to market an agglomerated material\r\nso as to avoid the drawbacks of fine ore. The agglomerated product must\r\nbe porous so as to afford access of the furnace-reducing gases to the\r\nore. It must be hard enough to bear transportation, and to carry the\r\nfurnace burden without crumbling to pieces. It must be waterproof, to a\r\ncertain extent, because considerations connected with securing low rates\r\nof freight make it necessary to be able to ship the concentrates to\r\nmarket in open coal cars, exposed to snow and rain. In many respects the\r\nattainment of these somewhat conflicting ends was the most perplexing\r\nof the problems which confronted Mr. Edison. The agglomeration of the\r\nconcentrates having been decided upon, two other considerations, not\r\nmentioned above, were of primary importance--first, to find a suitable\r\ncheap binding material; and, second, its nature must be such that\r\nvery little would be necessary per ton of concentrates. These severe\r\nrequirements were staggering, but Mr. Edison's courage did not falter.\r\nAlthough it seemed a well-nigh hopeless task, he entered upon the\r\ninvestigation with his usual optimism and vim. After many months\r\nof unremitting toil and research, and the trial of thousands of\r\nexperiments, the goal was reached in the completion of a successful\r\nformula for agglomerating the fine ore and pressing it into briquettes\r\nby special machinery.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the final process requisite for the making of a completed\r\ncommercial product. Its practice, of course, necessitated the addition\r\nof an entirely new department of the works, which was carried into\r\neffect by the construction and installation of the novel mixing and\r\nbriquetting machinery, together with extensions of the conveyors, with\r\nwhich the plant had already been liberally provided.\r\n\r\nBriefly described, the process consisted in mixing the concentrates with\r\nthe special binding material in machines of an entirely new type, and in\r\npassing the resultant pasty mass into the briquetting machines, where it\r\nwas pressed into cylindrical cakes three inches in diameter and one and\r\na half inches thick, under successive pressures of 7800, 14,000, and\r\n60,000 pounds. Each machine made these briquettes at the rate of sixty\r\nper minute, and dropped them into bucket conveyors by which they were\r\ncarried into drying furnaces, through which they made five loops, and\r\nwere then delivered to cross-conveyors which carried them into the\r\nstock-house. At the end of this process the briquettes were so hard\r\nthat they would not break or crumble in loading on the cars or in\r\ntransportation by rail, while they were so porous as to be capable of\r\nabsorbing 26 per cent. of their own volume in alcohol, but repelling\r\nwater absolutely--perfect \"old soaks.\"\r\n\r\nThus, with never-failing persistence and patience, coupled with intense\r\nthought and hard work, Edison met and conquered, one by one, the complex\r\ndifficulties that confronted him. He succeeded in what he had set out\r\nto do, and it is now to be noted that the product he had striven so\r\nsedulously to obtain was a highly commercial one, for not only did the\r\nbriquettes of concentrated ore fulfil the purpose of their creation, but\r\nin use actually tended to increase the working capacity of the furnace,\r\nas the following test, quoted from the Iron Age, October 28, 1897,\r\nwill attest: \"The only trial of any magnitude of the briquettes in\r\nthe blast-furnace was carried through early this year at the Crane Iron\r\nWorks, Catasauqua, Pennsylvania, by Leonard Peckitt.\r\n\r\n\"The furnace at which the test was made produces from one hundred to one\r\nhundred and ten tons per day when running on the ordinary mixture. The\r\ncharging of briquettes was begun with a percentage of 25 per cent.,\r\nand was carried up to 100 per cent. The following is the record of the\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n  RESULTS OF WORKING BRIQUETTES AT THE CRANE FURNACE\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Quantity of                       Phos-             ManDate\r\n  Briquette      Tons     Silica   phorus   Sulphur  ganese\r\n                    Working\r\n                   Per Cent.\r\n  January 5th          25        104        2.770    0.830    0.018    0.500\r\n  January 6th          37 1/2  4 1/2        2.620    0 740    0.018    0.350\r\n  January 7th          50        138 1/2    2.572    0.580    0.015    0.200\r\n  January 8th          75        119        1.844    0.264    0.022    0.200\r\n  January 9th         100        138 1/2    1.712    0.147    0.038    0.185\r\n\r\n\"On the 9th, at 5 P.M., the briquettes having been nearly exhausted,\r\nthe percentage was dropped to 25 per cent., and on the 10th the output\r\ndropped to 120 tons, and on the 11th the furnace had resumed the usual\r\nwork on the regular standard ores.\r\n\r\n\"These figures prove that the yield of the furnace is considerably\r\nincreased. The Crane trial was too short to settle the question to what\r\nextent the increase in product may be carried. This increase in output,\r\nof course, means a reduction in the cost of labor and of general\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n\"The richness of the ore and its purity of course affect the limestone\r\nconsumption. In the case of the Crane trial there was a reduction from\r\n30 per cent. to 12 per cent. of the ore charge.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, the fuel consumption is reduced, which in the case of the\r\nEastern plants, with their relatively costly coke, is a very important\r\nconsideration. It is regarded as possible that Eastern furnaces will\r\nbe able to use a smaller proportion of the costlier coke and\r\ncorrespondingly increase in anthracite coal, which is a cheaper fuel\r\nin that section. So far as foundry iron is concerned, the experience at\r\nCatasauqua, Pennsylvania, brief as it has been, shows that a stronger\r\nand tougher metal is made.\"\r\n\r\nEdison himself tells an interesting little story in this connection,\r\nwhen he enjoyed the active help of that noble character, John Fritz,\r\nthe distinguished inventor and pioneer of the modern steel industry\r\nin America. He says: \"When I was struggling along with the iron-ore\r\nconcentration, I went to see several blast-furnace men to sell the ore\r\nat the market price. They saw I was very anxious to sell it, and they\r\nwould take advantage of my necessity. But I happened to go to Mr. John\r\nFritz, of the Bethlehem Steel Company, and told him what I was doing.\r\n'Well,' he said to me, 'Edison, you are doing a good thing for the\r\nEastern furnaces. They ought to help you, for it will help us out. I am\r\nwilling to help you. I mix a little sentiment with business, and I will\r\ngive you an order for one hundred thousand tons.' And he sat right down\r\nand gave me the order.\"\r\n\r\nThe Edison concentrating plant has been sketched in the briefest outline\r\nwith a view of affording merely a bare idea of the great work of its\r\nprojector. To tell the whole story in detail and show its logical\r\nsequence, step by step, would take little less than a volume in itself,\r\nfor Edison's methods, always iconoclastic when progress is in sight,\r\nwere particularly so at the period in question. It has been said that\r\n\"Edison's scrap-heap contains the elements of a liberal education,\"\r\nand this was essentially true of the \"discard\" during the ore-milling\r\nexperience. Interesting as it might be to follow at length the numerous\r\nphases of ingenious and resourceful development that took place during\r\nthose busy years, the limit of present space forbids their relation. It\r\nwould, however, be denying the justice that is Edison's due to omit all\r\nmention of two hitherto unnamed items in particular that have added\r\nto the world's store of useful devices. We refer first to the great\r\ntravelling hoisting-crane having a span of two hundred and fifteen feet,\r\nand used for hoisting loads equal to ten tons, this being the largest\r\nof the kind made up to that time, and afterward used as a model by many\r\nothers. The second item was the ingenious and varied forms of conveyor\r\nbelt, devised and used by Edison at the concentrating works, and\r\nsubsequently developed into a separate and extensive business by an\r\nengineer to whom he gave permission to use his plans and patterns.\r\n\r\nEdison's native shrewdness and knowledge of human nature was put to\r\npractical use in the busy days of plant construction. It was found\r\nimpossible to keep mechanics on account of indifferent residential\r\naccommodations afforded by the tiny village, remote from civilization,\r\namong the central mountains of New Jersey. This puzzling question was\r\nmuch discussed between him and his associate, Mr. W. S. Mallory, until\r\nfinally he said to the latter: \"If we want to keep the men here we must\r\nmake it attractive for the women--so let us build some houses that will\r\nhave running water and electric lights, and rent at a low rate.\" He set\r\nto work, and in a day finished a design for a type of house. Fifty were\r\nquickly built and fully described in advertising for mechanics. Three\r\ndays' advertisements brought in over six hundred and fifty applications,\r\nand afterward Edison had no trouble in obtaining all the first-class men\r\nhe required, as settlers in the artificial Yosemite he was creating.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Mr. Mallory a characteristic story of this period as to\r\nan incidental unbending from toil, which in itself illustrates the\r\never-present determination to conquer what is undertaken: \"Along in\r\nthe latter part of the nineties, when the work on the problem of\r\nconcentrating iron ore was in progress, it became necessary when leaving\r\nthe plant at Edison to wait over at Lake Hopatcong one hour for a\r\nconnecting train. During some of these waits Mr. Edison had seen me play\r\nbilliards. At the particular time this incident happened, Mrs. Edison\r\nand her family were away for the summer, and I was staying at the\r\nGlenmont home on the Orange Mountains.\r\n\r\n\"One hot Saturday night, after Mr. Edison had looked over the evening\r\npapers, he said to me: 'Do you want to play a game of billiards?'\r\nNaturally this astonished me very much, as he is a man who cares\r\nlittle or nothing for the ordinary games, with the single exception of\r\nparcheesi, of which he is very fond. I said I would like to play, so we\r\nwent up into the billiard-room of the house. I took off the cloth, got\r\nout the balls, picked out a cue for Mr. Edison, and when we banked for\r\nthe first shot I won and started the game. After making two or three\r\nshots I missed, and a long carom shot was left for Mr. Edison, the cue\r\nball and object ball being within about twelve inches of each other, and\r\nthe other ball a distance of nearly the length of the table. Mr. Edison\r\nattempted to make the shot, but missed it and said 'Put the balls back.'\r\nSo I put them back in the same position and he missed it the second\r\ntime. I continued at his request to put the balls back in the same\r\nposition for the next fifteen minutes, until he could make the shot\r\nevery time--then he said: 'I don't want to play any more.'\"\r\n\r\nHaving taken a somewhat superficial survey of the great enterprise under\r\nconsideration; having had a cursory glance at the technical development\r\nof the plant up to the point of its successful culmination in the making\r\nof a marketable, commercial product as exemplified in the test at the\r\nCrane Furnace, let us revert to that demonstration and note the events\r\nthat followed. The facts of this actual test are far more eloquent than\r\nvolumes of argument would be as a justification of Edison's assiduous\r\nlabors for over eight years, and of the expenditure of a fortune in\r\nbringing his broad conception to a concrete possibility. In the patient\r\nsolving of tremendous problems he had toiled up the mountain-side of\r\nsuccess--scaling its topmost peak and obtaining a view of the boundless\r\nprospect. But, alas! \"The best laid plans o' mice and men gang aft\r\nagley.\" The discovery of great deposits of rich Bessemer ore in the\r\nMesaba range of mountains in Minnesota a year or two previous to the\r\ncompletion of his work had been followed by the opening up of those\r\ndeposits and the marketing of the ore. It was of such rich character\r\nthat, being cheaply mined by greatly improved and inexpensive methods,\r\nthe market price of crude ore of like iron units fell from about\r\n$6.50 to $3.50 per ton at the time when Edison was ready to supply his\r\nconcentrated product. At the former price he could have supplied the\r\nmarket and earned a liberal profit on his investment, but at $3.50 per\r\nton he was left without a reasonable chance of competition. Thus was\r\nswept away the possibility of reaping the reward so richly earned by\r\nyears of incessant thought, labor, and care. This great and notable\r\nplant, representing a very large outlay of money, brought to completion,\r\nready for business, and embracing some of the most brilliant and\r\nremarkable of Edison's inventions and methods, must be abandoned by\r\nforce of circumstances over which he had no control, and with it must\r\ndie the high hopes that his progressive, conquering march to success had\r\nlegitimately engendered.\r\n\r\nThe financial aspect of these enterprises is often overlooked and\r\nforgotten. In this instance it was of more than usual import and\r\nseriousness, as Edison was virtually his own \"backer,\" putting into the\r\ncompany almost the whole of all the fortune his inventions had brought\r\nhim. There is a tendency to deny to the capital that thus takes\r\ndesperate chances its full reward if things go right, and to insist that\r\nit shall have barely the legal rate of interest and far less than the\r\nreturn of over-the-counter retail trade. It is an absolute fact that the\r\ngreat electrical inventors and the men who stood behind them have had\r\nlittle return for their foresight and courage. In this instance, when\r\nthe inventor was largely his own financier, the difficulties and perils\r\nwere redoubled. Let Mr. Mallory give an instance: \"During the latter\r\npart of the panic of 1893 there came a period when we were very hard\r\nup for ready cash, due largely to the panicky conditions; and a large\r\npay-roll had been raised with considerable difficulty. A short time\r\nbefore pay-day our treasurer called me up by telephone, and said: 'I\r\nhave just received the paid checks from the bank, and I am fearful\r\nthat my assistant, who has forged my name to some of the checks, has\r\nabsconded with about $3000.' I went immediately to Mr. Edison and\r\ntold him of the forgery and the amount of money taken, and in what an\r\nembarrassing position we were for the next pay-roll. When I had finished\r\nhe said: 'It is too bad the money is gone, but I will tell you what to\r\ndo. Go and see the president of the bank which paid the forged checks.\r\nGet him to admit the bank's liability, and then say to him that Mr.\r\nEdison does not think the bank should suffer because he happened to have\r\na dishonest clerk in his employ. Also say to him that I shall not ask\r\nthem to make the amount good.' This was done; the bank admitting its\r\nliability and being much pleased with this action. When I reported to\r\nMr. Edison he said: 'That's all right. We have made a friend of the\r\nbank, and we may need friends later on.' And so it happened that some\r\ntime afterward, when we greatly needed help in the way of loans, the\r\nbank willingly gave us the accommodations we required to tide us over a\r\ncritical period.\"\r\n\r\nThis iron-ore concentrating project had lain close to Edison's heart and\r\nambition--indeed, it had permeated his whole being to the exclusion\r\nof almost all other investigations or inventions for a while. For five\r\nyears he had lived and worked steadily at Edison, leaving there only on\r\nSaturday night to spend Sunday at his home in Orange, and returning to\r\nthe plant by an early train on Monday morning. Life at Edison was of the\r\nsimple kind--work, meals, and a few hours' sleep--day by day. The little\r\nvillage, called into existence by the concentrating works, was of the\r\nmost primitive nature and offered nothing in the way of frivolity or\r\namusement. Even the scenery is austere. Hence Edison was enabled\r\nto follow his natural bent in being surrounded day and night by his\r\nresponsible chosen associates, with whom he worked uninterrupted by\r\noutsiders from early morning away into the late hours of the evening.\r\nThose who were laboring with him, inspired by his unflagging enthusiasm,\r\nfollowed his example and devoted all their long waking hours to the\r\nfurtherance of his plans with a zeal that ultimately bore fruit in the\r\npractical success here recorded.\r\n\r\nIn view of its present status, this colossal enterprise at Edison may\r\nwell be likened to the prologue of a play that is to be subsequently\r\nenacted for the benefit of future generations, but before ringing down\r\nthe curtain it is desirable to preserve the unities by quoting the\r\nwords of one of the principal actors, Mr. Mallory, who says: \"The\r\nConcentrating Works had been in operation, and we had produced a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the briquettes, and had been able to sell\r\nonly a portion of them, the iron market being in such condition that\r\nblast-furnaces were not making any new purchases of iron ore, and\r\nwere having difficulty to receive and consume the ores which had been\r\npreviously contracted for, so what sales we were able to make were at\r\nextremely low prices, my recollection being that they were between $3.50\r\nand $3.80 per ton, whereas when the works had started we had hoped to\r\nobtain $6.00 to $6.50 per ton for the briquettes. We had also thoroughly\r\ninvestigated the wonderful deposit at Mesaba, and it was with the\r\ngreatest possible reluctance that Mr. Edison was able to come finally to\r\nthe conclusion that, under existing conditions, the concentrating plant\r\ncould not then be made a commercial success. This decision was reached\r\nonly after the most careful investigations and calculations, as Mr.\r\nEdison was just as full of fight and ambition to make it a success as\r\nwhen he first started.\r\n\r\n\"When this decision was reached Mr. Edison and I took the Jersey Central\r\ntrain from Edison, bound for Orange, and I did not look forward to the\r\nimmediate future with any degree of confidence, as the concentrating\r\nplant was heavily in debt, without any early prospect of being able\r\nto pay off its indebtedness. On the train the matter of the future was\r\ndiscussed, and Mr. Edison said that, inasmuch as we had the knowledge\r\ngained from our experience in the concentrating problem, we must, if\r\npossible, apply it to some practical use, and at the same time we must\r\nwork out some other plans by which we could make enough money to pay\r\noff the Concentrating Company's indebtedness, Mr. Edison stating most\r\npositively that no company with which he had personally been actively\r\nconnected had ever failed to pay its debts, and he did not propose to\r\nhave the Concentrating Company any exception.\r\n\r\n\"In the discussion that followed he suggested several kinds of work\r\nwhich he had in his mind, and which might prove profitable. We\r\nfigured carefully over the probabilities of financial returns from the\r\nPhonograph Works and other enterprises, and after discussing many plans,\r\nit was finally decided that we would apply the knowledge we had gained\r\nin the concentrating plant by building a plant for manufacturing\r\nPortland cement, and that Mr. Edison would devote his attention to the\r\ndeveloping of a storage battery which did not use lead and sulphuric\r\nacid. So these two lines of work were taken up by Mr. Edison with just\r\nas much enthusiasm and energy as is usual with him, the commercial\r\nfailure of the concentrating plant seeming not to affect his spirits\r\nin any way. In fact, I have often been impressed strongly with the fact\r\nthat, during the dark days of the concentrating problem, Mr. Edison's\r\ndesire was very strong that the creditors of the Concentrating Works\r\nshould be paid in full; and only once did I hear him make any reference\r\nto the financial loss which he himself made, and he then said: 'As\r\nfar as I am concerned, I can any time get a job at $75 per month as\r\na telegrapher, and that will amply take care of all my personal\r\nrequirements.' As already stated, however, he started in with the\r\nmaximum amount of enthusiasm and ambition, and in the course of about\r\nthree years we succeeded in paying off all the indebtedness of the\r\nConcentrating Works, which amounted to several hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\"As to the state of Mr. Edison's mind when the final decision was\r\nreached to close down, if he was specially disappointed, there was\r\nnothing in his manner to indicate it, his every thought being for the\r\nfuture, and as to what could be done to pull us out of the financial\r\nsituation in which we found ourselves, and to take advantage of the\r\nknowledge which we had acquired at so great a cost.\"\r\n\r\nIt will have been gathered that the funds for this great experiment\r\nwere furnished largely by Edison. In fact, over two million dollars were\r\nspent in the attempt. Edison's philosophic view of affairs is given in\r\nthe following anecdote from Mr. Mallory: \"During the boom times of 1902,\r\nwhen the old General Electric stock sold at its high-water mark of about\r\n$330, Mr. Edison and I were on our way from the cement plant at New\r\nVillage, New Jersey, to his home at Orange. When we arrived at Dover,\r\nNew Jersey, we got a New York newspaper, and I called his attention to\r\nthe quotation of that day on General Electric. Mr. Edison then asked:\r\n'If I hadn't sold any of mine, what would it be worth to-day?' and after\r\nsome figuring I replied: 'Over four million dollars.' When Mr. Edison\r\nis thinking seriously over a problem he is in the habit of pulling his\r\nright eyebrow, which he did now for fifteen or twenty seconds. Then his\r\nface lighted up, and he said: 'Well, it's all gone, but we had a hell of\r\na good time spending it.'\" With which revelation of an attitude worthy\r\nof Mark Tapley himself, this chapter may well conclude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nEDISON PORTLAND CEMENT\r\n\r\nNEW developments in recent years have been more striking than the\r\ngeneral adoption of cement for structural purposes of all kinds in\r\nthe United States; or than the increase in its manufacture here. As\r\na material for the construction of office buildings, factories, and\r\ndwellings, it has lately enjoyed an extraordinary vogue; yet every\r\nindication is confirmatory of the belief that such use has barely begun.\r\nVarious reasons may be cited, such as the growing scarcity of wood, once\r\nthe favorite building material in many parts of the country, and the\r\nincreasing dearness of brick and stone. The fact remains, indisputable,\r\nand demonstrated flatly by the statistics of production. In 1902 the\r\nAmerican output of cement was placed at about 21,000,000 barrels,\r\nvalued at over $17,000,000. In 1907 the production is given as nearly\r\n49,000,000 barrels. Here then is an industry that doubled in five years.\r\nThe average rate of industrial growth in the United States is 10 per\r\ncent. a year, or doubling every ten years. It is a singular fact that\r\nelectricity also so far exceeds the normal rate as to double in value\r\nand quantity of output and investment every five years. There is perhaps\r\nmore than ordinary coincidence in the association of Edison with two\r\nsuch active departments of progress.\r\n\r\nAs a purely manufacturing business the general cement industry is one\r\nof even remote antiquity, and if Edison had entered into it merely as\r\na commercial enterprise by following paths already so well trodden, the\r\nfact would hardly have been worthy of even passing notice. It is not in\r\nhis nature, however, to follow a beaten track except in regard to the\r\nrecognition of basic principles; so that while the manufacture of Edison\r\nPortland cement embraces the main essentials and familiar processes of\r\ncement-making, such as crushing, drying, mixing, roasting, and grinding,\r\nhis versatility and originality, as exemplified in the conception and\r\nintroduction of some bold and revolutionary methods and devices, have\r\nresulted in raising his plant from the position of an outsider to the\r\nrank of the fifth largest producer in the United States, in the short\r\nspace of five years after starting to manufacture.\r\n\r\nLong before his advent in cement production, Edison had held very\r\npronounced views on the value of that material as the one which would\r\nobtain largely for future building purposes on account of its stability.\r\nMore than twenty-five years ago one of the writers of this narrative\r\nheard him remark during a discussion on ancient buildings: \"Wood will\r\nrot, stone will chip and crumble, bricks disintegrate, but a cement and\r\niron structure is apparently indestructible. Look at some of the old\r\nRoman baths. They are as solid as when they were built.\" With such\r\nconvictions, and the vast fund of practical knowledge and experience he\r\nhad gained at Edison in the crushing and manipulation of large masses of\r\nmagnetic iron ore during the preceding nine years, it is not surprising\r\nthat on that homeward railway journey, mentioned at the close of the\r\npreceding chapter, he should have decided to go into the manufacture\r\nof cement, especially in view of the enormous growth of its use for\r\nstructural purposes during recent times.\r\n\r\nThe field being a new one to him, Edison followed his usual course of\r\nreading up every page of authoritative literature on the subject, and\r\nseeking information from all quarters. In the mean time, while he was\r\nbusy also with his new storage battery, Mr. Mallory, who had been hard\r\nat work on the cement plan, announced that he had completed arrangements\r\nfor organizing a company with sufficient financial backing to carry on\r\nthe business; concluding with the remark that it was now time to engage\r\nengineers to lay out the plant. Edison replied that he intended to\r\ndo that himself, and invited Mr. Mallory to go with him to one of the\r\ndraughting-rooms on an upper floor of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nHere he placed a large sheet of paper on a draughting-table, and\r\nimmediately began to draw out a plan of the proposed works, continuing\r\nall day and away into the evening, when he finished; thus completing\r\nwithin the twenty-four hours the full lay-out of the entire plant as\r\nit was subsequently installed, and as it has substantially remained\r\nin practical use to this time. It will be granted that this was a\r\nremarkable engineering feat, especially in view of the fact that Edison\r\nwas then a new-comer in the cement business, and also that if the\r\nplant were to be rebuilt to-day, no vital change would be desirable\r\nor necessary. In that one day's planning every part was considered and\r\nprovided for, from the crusher to the packing-house. From one end to the\r\nother, the distance over which the plant stretches in length is about\r\nhalf a mile, and through the various buildings spread over this space\r\nthere passes, automatically, in course of treatment, a vast quantity\r\nof material resulting in the production of upward of two and a quarter\r\nmillion pounds of finished cement every twenty-four hours, seven days in\r\nthe week.\r\n\r\nIn that one day's designing provision was made not only for all\r\nimportant parts, but minor details, such, for instance, as the carrying\r\nof all steam, water, and air pipes, and electrical conductors in a large\r\nsubway running from one end of the plant to the other; and, an oiling\r\nsystem for the entire works. This latter deserves special mention, not\r\nonly because of its arrangement for thorough lubrication, but also on\r\naccount of the resultant economy affecting the cost of manufacture.\r\n\r\nEdison has strong convictions on the liberal use of lubricants, but\r\nargued that in the ordinary oiling of machinery there is great waste,\r\nwhile much dirt is conveyed into the bearings. He therefore planned\r\na system by which the ten thousand bearings in the plant are oiled\r\nautomatically; requiring the services of only two men for the entire\r\nwork. This is accomplished by a central pumping and filtering plant\r\nand the return of the oil from all parts of the works by gravity. Every\r\nbearing is made dust-proof, and is provided with two interior pipes. One\r\nis above and the other below the bearing. The oil flows in through the\r\nupper pipe, and, after lubricating the shaft, flows out through the\r\nlower pipe back to the pumping station, where any dirt is filtered out\r\nand the oil returned to circulation. While this system of oiling is\r\nnot unique, it was the first instance of its adaptation on so large and\r\ncomplete a scale, and illustrates the far-sightedness of his plans.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the adoption of this lubricating system there\r\noccurred another instance of his knowledge of materials and intuitive\r\ninsight into the nature of things. He thought that too frequent\r\ncirculation of a comparatively small quantity of oil would, to some\r\nextent, impair its lubricating qualities, and requested his assistants\r\nto verify this opinion by consultation with competent authorities. On\r\nmaking inquiry of the engineers of the Standard Oil Company, his theory\r\nwas fully sustained. Hence, provision was made for carrying a large\r\nstock of oil, and for giving a certain period of rest to that already\r\nused.\r\n\r\nA keen appreciation of ultimate success in the production of a fine\r\nquality of cement led Edison to provide very carefully in his original\r\nscheme for those details that he foresaw would become requisite--such,\r\nfor instance, as ample stock capacity for raw materials and their\r\nautomatic delivery in the various stages of manufacture, as well\r\nas mixing, weighing, and frequent sampling and analyzing during the\r\nprogress through the mills. This provision even included the details of\r\nthe packing-house, and his perspicacity in this case is well sustained\r\nfrom the fact that nine years afterward, in anticipation of building an\r\nadditional packing-house, the company sent a representative to different\r\nparts of the country to examine the systems used by manufacturers in\r\nthe packing of large quantities of various staple commodities involving\r\nsomewhat similar problems, and found that there was none better than\r\nthat devised before the cement plant was started. Hence, the order was\r\ngiven to build the new packing-house on lines similar to those of the\r\nold one.\r\n\r\nAmong the many innovations appearing in this plant are two that stand\r\nout in bold relief as indicating the large scale by which Edison\r\nmeasures his ideas. One of these consists of the crushing and grinding\r\nmachinery, and the other of the long kilns. In the preceding chapter\r\nthere has been given a description of the giant rolls, by means of which\r\ngreat masses of rock, of which individual pieces may weigh eight or more\r\ntons, are broken and reduced to about a fourteen-inch size. The economy\r\nof this is apparent when it is considered that in other cement plants\r\nthe limit of crushing ability is \"one-man size\"--that is, pieces not too\r\nlarge for one man to lift.\r\n\r\nThe story of the kiln, as told by Mr. Mallory, is illustrative of\r\nEdison's tendency to upset tradition and make a radical departure from\r\ngenerally accepted ideas. \"When Mr. Edison first decided to go into\r\nthe cement business, it was on the basis of his crushing-rolls and air\r\nseparation, and he had every expectation of installing duplicates of the\r\nkilns which were then in common use for burning cement. These kilns were\r\nusually made of boiler iron, riveted, and were about sixty feet long and\r\nsix feet in diameter, and had a capacity of about two hundred barrels of\r\ncement clinker in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\"When the detail plans for our plant were being drawn, Mr. Edison and I\r\nfigured over the coal capacity and coal economy of the sixty-foot kiln,\r\nand each time thought that both could he materially bettered. After\r\nhaving gone over this matter several times, he said: 'I believe I\r\ncan make a kiln which will give an output of one thousand barrels in\r\ntwenty-four hours.' Although I had then been closely associated with him\r\nfor ten years and was accustomed to see him accomplish great things, I\r\ncould not help feeling the improbability of his being able to jump into\r\nan old-established industry--as a novice--and start by improving the\r\n'heart' of the production so as to increase its capacity 400 per\r\ncent. When I pressed him for an explanation, he was unable to give any\r\ndefinite reasons, except that he felt positive it could be done. In this\r\nconnection let me say that very many times I have heard Mr. Edison make\r\npredictions as to what a certain mechanical device ought to do in the\r\nway of output and costs, when his statements did not seem to be even\r\namong the possibilities. Subsequently, after more or less experience,\r\nthese predictions have been verified, and I cannot help coming to the\r\nconclusion that he has a faculty, not possessed by the average mortal,\r\nof intuitively and correctly sizing up mechanical and commercial\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n\"But, returning to the kiln, Mr. Edison went to work immediately and\r\nvery soon completed the design of a new type which was to be one hundred\r\nand fifty feet long and nine feet in diameter, made up in ten-foot\r\nsections of cast iron bolted together and arranged to be revolved\r\non fifteen bearings. He had a wooden model made and studied it\r\nvery carefully, through a series of experiments. These resulted so\r\nsatisfactorily that this form was finally decided upon, and ultimately\r\ninstalled as part of the plant.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for a year or so the kiln problem was a nightmare to me. When we\r\nstarted up the plant experimentally, and the long kiln was first put in\r\noperation, an output of about four hundred barrels in twenty-four hours\r\nwas obtained. Mr. Edison was more than disappointed at this result. His\r\nterse comment on my report was: 'Rotten. Try it again.' When we became a\r\nlittle more familiar with the operation of the kiln we were able to\r\nget the output up to about five hundred and fifty barrels, and a little\r\nlater to six hundred and fifty barrels per day. I would go down to\r\nOrange and report with a great deal of satisfaction the increase in\r\noutput, but Mr. Edison would apparently be very much disappointed, and\r\noften said to me that the trouble was not with the kiln, but with our\r\nmethod of operating it; and he would reiterate his first statement that\r\nit would make one thousand barrels in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\"Each time I would return to the plant with the determination to\r\nincrease the output if possible, and we did increase it to seven\r\nhundred and fifty, then to eight hundred and fifty barrels. Every time I\r\nreported these increases Mr. Edison would still be disappointed. I said\r\nto him several times that if he was so sure the kiln could turn out one\r\nthousand barrels in twenty-four hours we would be very glad to have him\r\ntell us how to do it, and that we would run it in any way he directed.\r\nHe replied that he did not know what it was that kept the output down,\r\nbut he was just as confident as ever that the kiln would make one\r\nthousand barrels per day, and that if he had time to work with and watch\r\nthe kiln it would not take him long to find out the reasons why. He had\r\nmade a number of suggestions throughout these various trials, however,\r\nand, as we continued to operate, we learned additional points in\r\nhandling, and were able to get the output up to nine hundred barrels,\r\nthen one thousand, and finally to over eleven hundred barrels per day,\r\nthus more than realizing the prediction made by Mr. Edison before even\r\nthe plans were drawn. It is only fair to say, however, that prolonged\r\nexperience has led us to the conclusion that the maximum economy in\r\ncontinuous operation of these kilns is obtained by working them at a\r\nlittle less than their maximum capacity.\r\n\r\n\"It is interesting to note, in connection with the Edison type of kiln,\r\nthat when the older cement manufacturers first learned of it, they\r\nridiculed the idea universally, and were not slow to predict our early\r\n'finish' as cement manufacturers. The ultimate success of the kiln,\r\nhowever, proved their criticisms to be unwarranted. Once aware of\r\nits possibility, some of the cement manufacturers proceeded to avail\r\nthemselves of the innovation (at first without Mr. Edison's consent),\r\nand to-day more than one-half of the Portland cement produced in this\r\ncountry is made in kilns of the Edison type. Old plants are lengthening\r\ntheir kilns wherever practicable, and no wide-awake manufacturer\r\nbuilding a modern plant could afford to install other than these long\r\nkilns. This invention of Mr. Edison has been recognized by the larger\r\ncement manufacturers, and there is every prospect now that the entire\r\ntrade will take licenses under his kiln patents.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he decided to go into the cement business, Edison was\r\nthoroughly awake to the fact that he was proposing to \"butt into\" an\r\nold-established industry, in which the principal manufacturers\r\nwere concerns of long standing. He appreciated fully its inherent\r\ndifficulties, not only in manufacture, but also in the marketing of the\r\nproduct. These considerations, together with his long-settled principle\r\nof striving always to make the best, induced him at the outset to study\r\nmethods of producing the highest quality of product. Thus he was led to\r\noriginate innovations in processes, some of which have been preserved\r\nas trade secrets; but of the others there are two deserving special\r\nnotice--namely, the accuracy of mixing and the fineness of grinding.\r\n\r\nIn cement-making, generally speaking, cement rock and limestone in\r\nthe rough are mixed together in such relative quantities as may be\r\ndetermined upon in advance by chemical analysis. In many plants this\r\nmixture is made by barrow or load units, and may be more or less\r\naccurate. Rule-of-thumb methods are never acceptable to Edison, and he\r\ndevised therefore a system of weighing each part of the mixture, so\r\nthat it would be correct to a pound, and, even at that, made the device\r\n\"fool-proof,\" for as he observed to one of his associates: \"The man at\r\nthe scales might get to thinking of the other fellow's best girl, so\r\nfifty or a hundred pounds of rock, more or less, wouldn't make much\r\ndifference to him.\" The Edison checking plan embraces two hoppers\r\nsuspended above two platform scales whose beams are electrically\r\nconnected with a hopper-closing device by means of needles dipping into\r\nmercury cups. The scales are set according to the chemist's weighing\r\norders, and the material is fed into the scales from the hoppers. The\r\ninstant the beam tips, the connection is broken and the feed stops\r\ninstantly, thus rendering it impossible to introduce any more material\r\nuntil the charge has been unloaded.\r\n\r\nThe fine grinding of cement clinker is distinctively Edisonian in\r\nboth origin and application. As has been already intimated, its author\r\nfollowed a thorough course of reading on the subject long before\r\nreaching the actual projection or installation of a plant, and he had\r\nfound all authorities to agree on one important point--namely, that the\r\nvalue of cement depends upon the fineness to which it is ground. [16] He\r\nalso ascertained that in the trade the standard of fineness was that 75\r\nper cent. of the whole mass would pass through a 200-mesh screen. Having\r\nmade some improvements in his grinding and screening apparatus, and\r\nbelieving that in the future engineers, builders, and contractors\r\nwould eventually require a higher degree of fineness, he determined, in\r\nadvance of manufacturing, to raise the standard ten points, so that at\r\nleast 85 per cent. of his product should pass through a 200-mesh screen.\r\nThis was a bold step to be taken by a new-comer, but his judgment,\r\nbacked by a full confidence in ability to live up to this standard, has\r\nbeen fully justified in its continued maintenance, despite the early\r\nincredulity of older manufacturers as to the possibility of attaining\r\nsuch a high degree of fineness.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 16: For a proper understanding and full\r\n     appreciation of the importance of fine grinding, it may be\r\n     explained that Portland cement (as manufactured in the\r\n     Lehigh Valley) is made from what is commonly spoken of as\r\n     \"cement rock,\" with the addition of sufficient limestone to\r\n     give the necessary amount of lime. The rock is broken down\r\n     and then ground to a fineness of 80 to 90 per cent. through\r\n     a 200-mesh screen. This ground material passes through kilns\r\n     and comes out in \"clinker.\" This is ground and that part of\r\n     this finely ground clinker that will pass a 200-mesh screen\r\n     is cement; the residue is still clinker. These coarse\r\n     particles, or clinkers, absorb water very slowly, are\r\n     practically inert, and have very feeble cementing\r\n     properties. The residue on a 200-mesh screen is useless.]\r\n\r\nIf Edison measured his happiness, as men often do, by merely commercial\r\nor pecuniary rewards of success, it would seem almost redundant to state\r\nthat he has continued to manifest an intense interest in the cement\r\nplant. Ordinarily, his interest as an inventor wanes in proportion to\r\nthe approach to mere commercialism--in other words, the keenness of his\r\npleasure is in overcoming difficulties rather than the mere piling up of\r\na bank account. He is entirely sensible of the advantages arising from\r\na good balance at the banker's, but that has not been the goal of his\r\nambition. Hence, although his cement enterprise reached the commercial\r\nstage a long time ago, he has been firmly convinced of his own ability\r\nto devise still further improvements and economical processes of greater\r\nor less fundamental importance, and has, therefore, made a constant\r\nstudy of the problem as a whole and in all its parts. By means of\r\nfrequent reports, aided by his remarkable memory, he keeps in as close\r\ntouch with the plant as if he were there in person every day, and\r\nis thus enabled to suggest improvement in any particular detail. The\r\nengineering force has a great respect for the accuracy of his knowledge\r\nof every part of the plant, for he remembers the dimensions and details\r\nof each item of machinery, sometimes to the discomfiture of those who\r\nare around it every day.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy instance of Edison's memory occurred in connection with\r\nthis cement plant. Some years ago, as its installation was nearing\r\ncompletion, he went up to look it over and satisfy himself as to what\r\nneeded to be done. On the arrival of the train at 10.40 in the morning,\r\nhe went to the mill, and, with Mr. Mason, the general superintendent,\r\nstarted at the crusher at one end, and examined every detail all the way\r\nthrough to the packing-house at the other end. He made neither notes nor\r\nmemoranda, but the examination required all the day, which happened to\r\nbe a Saturday. He took a train for home at 5.30 in the afternoon, and on\r\narriving at his residence at Orange, got out some note-books and began\r\nto write entirely from memory each item consecutively. He continued\r\nat this task all through Saturday night, and worked steadily on until\r\nSunday afternoon, when he completed a list of nearly six hundred items.\r\nThe nature of this feat is more appreciable from the fact that a large\r\nnumber of changes included all the figures of new dimensions he had\r\ndecided upon for some of the machinery throughout the plant.\r\n\r\nAs the reader may have a natural curiosity to learn whether or not the\r\nlist so made was practical, it may be stated that it was copied and\r\nsent up to the general superintendent with instructions to make the\r\nmodifications suggested, and report by numbers as they were attended to.\r\nThis was faithfully done, all the changes being made before the plant\r\nwas put into operation. Subsequent experience has amply proven the value\r\nof Edison's prescience at this time.\r\n\r\nAlthough Edison's achievements in the way of improved processes and\r\nmachinery have already made a deep impression in the cement industry,\r\nit is probable that this impression will become still more profoundly\r\nstamped upon it in the near future with the exploitation of his \"Poured\r\nCement House.\" The broad problem which he set himself was to provide\r\nhandsome and practically indestructible detached houses, which could be\r\ntaken by wage-earners at very moderate monthly rentals. He turned\r\nthis question over in his mind for several years, and arrived at the\r\nconclusion that a house cast in one piece would be the answer. To\r\nproduce such a house involved the overcoming of many engineering and\r\nother technical difficulties. These he attacked vigorously and disposed\r\nof patiently one by one.\r\n\r\nIn this connection a short anecdote may be quoted from Edison as\r\nindicative of one of the influences turning his thoughts in this\r\ndirection. In the story of the ore-milling work, it has been noted that\r\nthe plant was shut down owing to the competition of the cheap ore\r\nfrom the Mesaba Range. Edison says: \"When I shut down, the insurance\r\ncompanies cancelled my insurance. I asked the reason why. 'Oh,' they\r\nsaid, 'this thing is a failure. The moral risk is too great.' 'All\r\nright; I am glad to hear it. I will now construct buildings that won't\r\nhave any moral risk.' I determined to go into the Portland cement\r\nbusiness. I organized a company and started cement-works which have\r\nnow been running successfully for several years. I had so perfected the\r\nmachinery in trying to get my ore costs down that the making of cheap\r\ncement was an easy matter to me. I built these works entirely of\r\nconcrete and steel, so that there is not a wagon-load of lumber in them;\r\nand so that the insurance companies would not have any possibility of\r\nhaving any 'moral risk.' Since that time I have put up numerous factory\r\nbuildings all of steel and concrete, without any combustible whatever\r\nabout them--to avoid this 'moral risk.' I am carrying further the\r\napplication of this idea in building private houses for poor people, in\r\nwhich there will be no 'moral risk' at all--nothing whatever to burn,\r\nnot even by lightning.\"\r\n\r\nAs a casting necessitates a mold, together with a mixture sufficiently\r\nfluid in its nature to fill all the interstices completely, Edison\r\ndevoted much attention to an extensive series of experiments for\r\nproducing a free-flowing combination of necessary materials. His\r\nproposition was against all precedent. All expert testimony pointed to\r\nthe fact that a mixture of concrete (cement, sand, crushed stone, and\r\nwater) could not be made to flow freely to the smallest parts of an\r\nintricate set of molds; that the heavy parts of the mixture could not\r\nbe held in suspension, but would separate out by gravity and make\r\nan unevenly balanced structure; that the surface would be full of\r\nimperfections, etc.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by the unanimity of adverse opinions, however, he pursued his\r\ninvestigations with the thorough minuteness that characterizes all his\r\nlaboratory work, and in due time produced a mixture which on elaborate\r\ntest overcame all objections and answered the complex requirements\r\nperfectly, including the making of a surface smooth, even, and entirely\r\nwaterproof. All the other engineering problems have received study in\r\nlike manner, and have been overcome, until at the present writing the\r\nwhole question is practically solved and has been reduced to actual\r\npractice. The Edison poured or cast cement house may be reckoned as a\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nThe general scheme, briefly outlined, is to prepare a model and plans of\r\nthe house to be cast, and then to design a set of molds in sections of\r\nconvenient size. When all is ready, these molds, which are of cast iron\r\nwith smooth interior surfaces, are taken to the place where the house\r\nis to be erected. Here there has been provided a solid concrete cellar\r\nfloor, technically called \"footing.\" The molds are then locked together\r\nso that they rest on this footing. Hundreds of pieces are necessary for\r\nthe complete set. When they have been completely assembled, there will\r\nbe a hollow space in the interior, representing the shape of the house.\r\nReinforcing rods are also placed in the molds, to be left behind in the\r\nfinished house.\r\n\r\nNext comes the pouring of the concrete mixture into this form. Large\r\nmechanical mixers are used, and, as it is made, the mixture is dumped\r\ninto tanks, from which it is conveyed to a distributing tank on the top,\r\nor roof, of the form. From this tank a large number of open troughs or\r\npipes lead the mixture to various openings in the roof, whence it flows\r\ndown and fills all parts of the mold from the footing in the basement\r\nuntil it overflows at the tip of the roof.\r\n\r\nThe pouring of the entire house is accomplished in about six hours,\r\nand then the molds are left undisturbed for six days, in order that the\r\nconcrete may set and harden. After that time the work of taking away\r\nthe molds is begun. This requires three or four days. When the molds are\r\ntaken away an entire house is disclosed, cast in one piece, from cellar\r\nto tip of roof, complete with floors, interior walls, stairways, bath\r\nand laundry tubs, electric-wire conduits, gas, water, and heating pipes.\r\nNo plaster is used anywhere; but the exterior and interior walls\r\nare smooth and may be painted or tinted, if desired. All that is\r\nnow necessary is to put in the windows, doors, heater, and lighting\r\nfixtures, and to connect up the plumbing and heating arrangements, thus\r\nmaking the house ready for occupancy.\r\n\r\nAs these iron molds are not ephemeral like the wooden framing now used\r\nin cement construction, but of practically illimitable life, it is\r\nobvious that they can be used a great number of times. A complete set\r\nof molds will cost approximately $25,000, while the necessary plant\r\nwill cost about $15,000 more. It is proposed to work as a unit plant for\r\nsuccessful operation at least six sets of molds, to keep the men busy\r\nand the machinery going. Any one, with a sheet of paper, can ascertain\r\nthe yearly interest on the investment as a fixed charge to be assessed\r\nagainst each house, on the basis that one hundred and forty-four houses\r\ncan be built in a year with the battery of six sets of molds. Putting\r\nthe sum at $175,000, and the interest at 6 per cent. on the cost of the\r\nmolds and 4 per cent. for breakage, together with 6 per cent. interest\r\nand 15 per cent. depreciation on machinery, the plant charge is\r\napproximately $140 per house. It does not require a particularly acute\r\nprophetic vision to see \"Flower Towns\" of \"Poured Houses\" going up in\r\nwhole suburbs outside all our chief centres of population.\r\n\r\nEdison's conception of the workingman's ideal house has been a broad\r\none from the very start. He was not content merely to provide a roomy,\r\nmoderately priced house that should be fireproof, waterproof, and\r\nvermin-proof, and practically indestructible, but has been solicitous\r\nto get away from the idea of a plain \"packing-box\" type. He has also\r\nprovided for ornamentation of a high class in designing the details of\r\nthe structure. As he expressed it: \"We will give the workingman and his\r\nfamily ornamentation in their house. They deserve it, and besides, it\r\ncosts no more after the pattern is made to give decorative effects than\r\nit would to make everything plain.\" The plans have provided for a type\r\nof house that would cost not far from $30,000 if built of cut stone. He\r\ngave to Messrs. Mann & McNaillie, architects, New York, his idea of\r\nthe type of house he wanted. On receiving these plans he changed them\r\nconsiderably, and built a model. After making many more changes in this\r\nwhile in the pattern shop, he produced a house satisfactory to himself.\r\n\r\nThis one-family house has a floor plan twenty-five by thirty feet, and\r\nis three stories high. The first floor is divided off into two large\r\nrooms--parlor and living-room--and the upper floors contain four large\r\nbedrooms, a roomy bath-room, and wide halls. The front porch extends\r\neight feet, and the back porch three feet. A cellar seven and a half\r\nfeet high extends under the whole house, and will contain the boiler,\r\nwash-tubs, and coal-bunker. It is intended that the house shall be built\r\non lots forty by sixty feet, giving a lawn and a small garden.\r\n\r\nIt is contemplated that these houses shall be built in industrial\r\ncommunities, where they can be put up in groups of several hundred. If\r\nerected in this manner, and by an operator buying his materials in large\r\nquantities, Edison believes that these houses can be erected complete,\r\nincluding heating apparatus and plumbing, for $1200 each. This figure\r\nwould also rest on the basis of using in the mixture the gravel\r\nexcavated on the site. Comment has been made by persons of artistic\r\ntaste on the monotony of a cluster of houses exactly alike in\r\nappearance, but this criticism has been anticipated, and the molds are\r\nso made as to be capable of permutations of arrangement. Thus it will\r\nbe possible to introduce almost endless changes in the style of house by\r\nvariation of the same set of molds.\r\n\r\nFor more than forty years Edison was avowedly an inventor for purely\r\ncommercial purposes; but within the last two years he decided to retire\r\nfrom that field so far as new inventions were concerned, and to devote\r\nhimself to scientific research and experiment in the leisure hours\r\nthat might remain after continuing to improve his existing devices.\r\nBut although the poured cement house was planned during the commercial\r\nperiod, the spirit in which it was conceived arose out of an earnest\r\ndesire to place within the reach of the wage-earner an opportunity to\r\nbetter his physical, pecuniary, and mental conditions in so far as that\r\ncould be done through the medium of hygienic and beautiful homes at\r\nmoderate rentals. From the first Edison has declared that it was not\r\nhis intention to benefit pecuniarily through the exploitation of this\r\nproject. Having actually demonstrated the practicability and feasibility\r\nof his plans, he will allow responsible concerns to carry them into\r\npractice under such limitations as may be necessary to sustain the basic\r\nobject, but without any payment to him except for the actual expense\r\nincurred. The hypercritical may cavil and say that, as a manufacturer of\r\ncement, Edison will be benefited. True, but as ANY good Portland cement\r\ncan be used, and no restrictions as to source of supply are enforced,\r\nhe, or rather his company, will be merely one of many possible\r\npurveyors.\r\n\r\nThis invention is practically a gift to the workingmen of the world\r\nand their families. The net result will be that those who care to avail\r\nthemselves of the privilege may, sooner or later, forsake the\r\ncrowded apartment or tenement and be comfortably housed in sanitary,\r\nsubstantial, and roomy homes fitted with modern conveniences, and\r\nbeautified by artistic decorations, with no outlay for insurance or\r\nrepairs; no dread of fire, and all at a rental which Edison believes\r\nwill be not more, but probably less than, $10 per month in any city\r\nof the United States. While his achievement in its present status will\r\nbring about substantial and immediate benefits to wage-earners, his\r\nthoughts have already travelled some years ahead in the formulation of a\r\nstill further beneficial project looking toward the individual ownership\r\nof these houses on a basis startling in its practical possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMOTION PICTURES\r\n\r\nTHE preceding chapters have treated of Edison in various aspects as an\r\ninventor, some of which are familiar to the public, others of which are\r\nbelieved to be in the nature of a novel revelation, simply because no\r\none had taken the trouble before to put the facts together. To those\r\nwho have perhaps grown weary of seeing Edison's name in articles of\r\na sensational character, it may sound strange to say that, after all,\r\njustice has not been done to his versatile and many-sided nature; and\r\nthat the mere prosaic facts of his actual achievement outrun the wildest\r\nflights of irrelevant journalistic imagination. Edison hates nothing\r\nmore than to be dubbed a genius or played up as a \"wizard\"; but this\r\nfate has dogged him until he has come at last to resign himself to it\r\nwith a resentful indignation only to be appreciated when watching\r\nhim read the latest full-page Sunday \"spread\" that develops a casual\r\nconversation into oracular verbosity, and gives to his shrewd surmise\r\nthe cast of inspired prophecy.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Edison's real work has seldom been seriously discussed.\r\nRather has it been taken as a point of departure into a realm of fancy\r\nand romance, where as a relief from drudgery he is sometimes quite\r\nwilling to play the pipe if some one will dance to it. Indeed, the\r\nstories woven around his casual suggestions are tame and vapid alongside\r\nhis own essays in fiction, probably never to be published, but which\r\nshow what a real inventor can do when he cuts loose to create a new\r\nheaven and a new earth, unrestrained by any formal respect for existing\r\nconditions of servitude to three dimensions and the standard elements.\r\n\r\nThe present chapter, essentially technical in its subject-matter, is\r\nperhaps as significant as any in this biography, because it presents\r\nEdison as the Master Impresario of his age, and maybe of many following\r\nages also. His phonographs and his motion pictures have more audiences\r\nin a week than all the theatres in America in a year. The \"Nickelodeon\"\r\nis the central fact in modern amusement, and Edison founded it. All that\r\nmillions know of music and drama he furnishes; and the whole study of\r\nthe theatrical managers thus reaching the masses is not to ascertain the\r\nlimitations of the new art, but to discover its boundless possibilities.\r\nNone of the exuberant versions of things Edison has not done could\r\nendure for a moment with the simple narrative of what he has really done\r\nas the world's new Purveyor of Pleasure. And yet it all depends on\r\nthe toilful conquest of a subtle and intricate art. The story of the\r\ninvention of the phonograph has been told. That of the evolution of\r\nmotion pictures follows. It is all one piece of sober, careful analysis,\r\nand stubborn, successful attack on the problem.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of making a record of animate movement, and subsequently\r\nreproducing it, was predicted long before the actual accomplishment.\r\nThis, as we have seen, was also the case with the phonograph, the\r\ntelephone, and the electric light. As to the phonograph, the prediction\r\nwent only so far as the RESULT; the apparent intricacy of the problem\r\nbeing so great that the MEANS for accomplishing the desired end\r\nwere seemingly beyond the grasp of the imagination or the mastery of\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nWith the electric light and the telephone the prediction included not\r\nonly the result to be accomplished, but, in a rough and general way,\r\nthe mechanism itself; that is to say, long before a single sound was\r\nintelligibly transmitted it was recognized that such a thing might be\r\ndone by causing a diaphragm, vibrated by original sounds, to communicate\r\nits movements to a distant diaphragm by a suitably controlled electric\r\ncurrent. In the case of the electric light, the heating of a conductor\r\nto incandescence in a highly rarefied atmosphere was suggested as a\r\nscheme of illumination long before its actual accomplishment, and\r\nin fact before the production of a suitable generator for delivering\r\nelectric current in a satisfactory and economical manner.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that while the modern art of motion pictures\r\ndepends essentially on the development of instantaneous photography,\r\nthe suggestion of the possibility of securing a reproduction of animate\r\nmotion, as well as, in a general way, of the mechanism for accomplishing\r\nthe result, was made many years before the instantaneous photograph\r\nbecame possible. While the first motion picture was not actually\r\nproduced until the summer of 1889, its real birth was almost a century\r\nearlier, when Plateau, in France, constructed an optical toy, to which\r\nthe impressive name of \"Phenakistoscope\" was applied, for producing an\r\nillusion of motion. This toy in turn was the forerunner of the Zoetrope,\r\nor so-called \"Wheel of Life,\" which was introduced into this country\r\nabout the year 1845. These devices were essentially toys, depending for\r\ntheir successful operation (as is the case with motion pictures) upon\r\na physiological phenomenon known as persistence of vision. If, for\r\ninstance, a bright light is moved rapidly in front of the eye in a dark\r\nroom, it appears not as an illuminated spark, but as a line of fire;\r\na so-called shooting star, or a flash of lightning produces the same\r\neffect. This result is purely physiological, and is due to the fact\r\nthat the retina of the eye may be considered as practically a sensitized\r\nplate of relatively slow speed, and an image impressed upon it remains,\r\nbefore being effaced, for a period of from one-tenth to one-seventh of\r\na second, varying according to the idiosyncrasies of the individual and\r\nthe intensity of the light. When, therefore, it is said that we should\r\nonly believe things we actually see, we ought to remember that in almost\r\nevery instance we never see things as they are.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the fact that when an image is impressed on the human\r\nretina it persists for an appreciable period, varying as stated,\r\nwith the individual, and depending also upon the intensity of the\r\nillumination, it will be seen that, if a number of pictures or\r\nphotographs are successively presented to the eye, they will appear as\r\na single, continuous photograph, provided the periods between them are\r\nshort enough to prevent one of the photographs from being effaced before\r\nits successor is presented. If, for instance, a series of identical\r\nportraits were rapidly presented to the eye, a single picture would\r\napparently be viewed, or if we presented to the eye the series\r\nof photographs of a moving object, each one representing a minute\r\nsuccessive phase of the movement, the movements themselves would\r\napparently again take place.\r\n\r\nWith the Zoetrope and similar toys rough drawings were used for\r\ndepicting a few broadly outlined successive phases of movement, because\r\nin their day instantaneous photography was unknown, and in addition\r\nthere were certain crudities of construction that seriously interfered\r\nwith the illumination of the pictures, rendering it necessary to make\r\nthem practically as silhouettes on a very conspicuous background.\r\nHence it will be obvious that these toys produced merely an ILLUSION of\r\nTHEORETICAL motion.\r\n\r\nBut with the knowledge of even an illusion of motion, and with the\r\nphilosophy of persistence of vision fully understood, it would\r\nseem that, upon the development of instantaneous photography, the\r\nreproduction of ACTUAL motion by means of pictures would have followed,\r\nalmost as a necessary consequence. Yet such was not the case, and\r\nsuccess was ultimately accomplished by Edison only after persistent\r\nexperimenting along lines that could not have been predicted, including\r\nthe construction of apparatus for the purpose, which, if it had not been\r\nmade, would undoubtedly be considered impossible. In fact, if it were\r\nnot for Edison's peculiar mentality, that refuses to recognize anything\r\nas impossible until indubitably demonstrated to be so, the production of\r\nmotion pictures would certainly have been delayed for years, if not for\r\nall time.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest suggestions of the possibility of utilizing\r\nphotography for exhibiting the illusion of actual movement was made by\r\nDucos, who, as early as 1864, obtained a patent in France, in which\r\nhe said: \"My invention consists in substituting rapidly and without\r\nconfusion to the eye not only of an individual, but when so desired of a\r\nwhole assemblage, the enlarged images of a great number of pictures when\r\ntaken instantaneously and successively at very short intervals....\r\nThe observer will believe that he sees only one image, which changes\r\ngradually by reason of the successive changes of form and position of\r\nthe objects which occur from one picture to the other. Even supposing\r\nthat there be a slight interval of time during which the same object was\r\nnot shown, the persistence of the luminous impression upon the eye\r\nwill fill this gap. There will be as it were a living representation of\r\nnature and . . . the same scene will be reproduced upon the screen with\r\nthe same degree of animation.... By means of my apparatus I am enabled\r\nespecially to reproduce the passing of a procession, a review of\r\nmilitary manoeuvres, the movements of a battle, a public fete, a\r\ntheatrical scene, the evolution or the dances of one or of several\r\npersons, the changing expression of countenance, or, if one desires,\r\nthe grimaces of a human face; a marine view, the motion of waves,\r\nthe passage of clouds in a stormy sky, particularly in a mountainous\r\ncountry, the eruption of a volcano,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOther dreamers, contemporaries of Ducos, made similar suggestions; they\r\nrecognized the scientific possibility of the problem, but they were\r\nirretrievably handicapped by the shortcomings of photography. Even when\r\nsubstantially instantaneous photographs were evolved at a somewhat\r\nlater date they were limited to the use of wet plates, which have to be\r\nprepared by the photographer and used immediately, and were therefore\r\nquite out of the question for any practical commercial scheme. Besides\r\nthis, the use of plates would have been impracticable, because the\r\nlimitations of their weight and size would have prevented the taking\r\nof a large number of pictures at a high rate of speed, even if the\r\nsensitized surface had been sufficiently rapid.\r\n\r\nNothing ever came of Ducos' suggestions and those of the early dreamers\r\nin this essentially practical and commercial art, and their ideas\r\nhave made no greater impress upon the final result than Jules Verne's\r\nNautilus of our boyhood days has developed the modern submarine. From\r\ntime to time further suggestions were made, some in patents, and others\r\nin photographic and scientific publications, all dealing with the\r\nfascinating thought of preserving and representing actual scenes and\r\nevents. The first serious attempt to secure an illusion of motion by\r\nphotography was made in 1878 by Edward Muybridge as a result of a\r\nwager with the late Senator Leland Stanford, the California pioneer\r\nand horse-lover, who had asserted, contrary to the usual belief, that\r\na trotting-horse at one point in its gait left the ground entirely. At\r\nthis time wet plates of very great rapidity were known, and by arranging\r\na series of cameras along the line of a track and causing the horse\r\nin trotting past them, by striking wires or strings attached to the\r\nshutters, to actuate the cameras at the right instant, a series of very\r\nclear instantaneous photographs was obtained. From these negatives,\r\nwhen developed, positive prints were made, which were later mounted on a\r\nmodified form of Zoetrope and projected upon a screen.\r\n\r\nOne of these early exhibitions is described in the Scientific American\r\nof June 5, 1880: \"While the separate photographs had shown the\r\nsuccessive positions of a trotting or running horse in making a single\r\nstride, the Zoogyroscope threw upon the screen apparently the living\r\nanimal. Nothing was wanting but the clatter of hoofs upon the turf, and\r\nan occasional breath of steam from the nostrils, to make the spectator\r\nbelieve that he had before him genuine flesh-and-blood steeds. In the\r\nviews of hurdle-leaping, the simulation was still more admirable, even\r\nto the motion of the tail as the animal gathered for the jump, the\r\nraising of his head, all were there. Views of an ox trotting, a wild\r\nbull on the charge, greyhounds and deer running and birds flying in\r\nmid-air were shown, also athletes in various positions.\" It must not be\r\nassumed from this statement that even as late as the work of Muybridge\r\nanything like a true illusion of movement had been obtained, because\r\nsuch was not the case. Muybridge secured only one cycle of movement,\r\nbecause a separate camera had to be used for each photograph and\r\nconsequently each cycle was reproduced over and over again. To have made\r\nphotographs of a trotting-horse for one minute at the moderate rate of\r\ntwelve per second would have required, under the Muybridge scheme, seven\r\nhundred and twenty separate cameras, whereas with the modern art only a\r\nsingle camera is used. A further defect with the Muybridge pictures was\r\nthat since each photograph was secured when the moving object was in the\r\ncentre of the plate, the reproduction showed the object always centrally\r\non the screen with its arms or legs in violent movement, but not making\r\nany progress, and with the scenery rushing wildly across the field of\r\nview!\r\n\r\nIn the early 80's the dry plate was first introduced into general\r\nuse, and from that time onward its rapidity and quality were gradually\r\nimproved; so much so that after 1882 Prof. E. J. Marey, of the French\r\nAcademy, who in 1874 had published a well-known treatise on \"Animal\r\nMovement,\" was able by the use of dry plates to carry forward the\r\nexperiments of Muybridge on a greatly refined scale. Marey was, however,\r\nhandicapped by reason of the fact that glass plates were still used,\r\nalthough he was able with a single camera to obtain twelve photographs\r\non successive plates in the space of one second. Marey, like Muybridge,\r\nphotographed only one cycle of the movements of a single object, which\r\nwas subsequently reproduced over and over again, and the camera was in\r\nthe form of a gun, which could follow the object so that the successive\r\npictures would be always located in the centre of the plates.\r\n\r\nThe review above given, as briefly as possible, comprises substantially\r\nthe sum of the world's knowledge at the time the problem of recording\r\nand reproducing animate movement was first undertaken by Edison. The\r\nmost that could be said of the condition of the art when Edison\r\nentered the field was that it had been recognized that if a series of\r\ninstantaneous photographs of a moving object could be secured at an\r\nenormously high rate many times per second--they might be passed before\r\nthe eye either directly or by projection upon a screen, and thereby\r\nresult in a reproduction of the movements. Two very serious difficulties\r\nlay in the way of actual accomplishment, however--first, the production\r\nof a sensitive surface in such form and weight as to be capable of being\r\nsuccessively brought into position and exposed, at the necessarily high\r\nrate; and, second, the production of a camera capable of so taking the\r\npictures. There were numerous other workers in the field, but they added\r\nnothing to what had already been proposed. Edison himself knew nothing\r\nof Ducos, or that the suggestions had advanced beyond the single\r\ncentrally located photographs of Muybridge and Marey. As a matter of\r\npublic policy, the law presumes that an inventor must be familiar with\r\nall that has gone before in the field within which he is working, and\r\nif a suggestion is limited to a patent granted in New South Wales, or\r\nis described in a single publication in Brazil, an inventor in America,\r\nengaged in the same field of thought, is by legal fiction presumed to\r\nhave knowledge not only of the existence of that patent or publication,\r\nbut of its contents. We say this not in the way of an apology for the\r\nextent of Edison's contribution to the motion-picture art, because there\r\ncan be no question that he was as much the creator of that art as he\r\nwas of the phonographic art; but to show that in a practical sense the\r\nsuggestion of the art itself was original with him. He himself says: \"In\r\nthe year 1887 the idea occurred to me that it was possible to devise an\r\ninstrument which should do for the eye what the phonograph does for the\r\near, and that by a combination of the two, all motion and sound could\r\nbe recorded and reproduced simultaneously. This idea, the germ of which\r\ncame from the little toy called the Zoetrope and the work of Muybridge,\r\nMarey, and others, has now been accomplished, so that every change\r\nof facial expression can be recorded and reproduced life-size. The\r\nkinetoscope is only a small model illustrating the present stage of the\r\nprogress, but with each succeeding month new possibilities are brought\r\ninto view. I believe that in coming years, by my own work and that\r\nof Dickson, Muybridge, Marey, and others who will doubtless enter the\r\nfield, grand opera can be given at the Metropolitan Opera House at New\r\nYork without any material change from the original, and with artists and\r\nmusicians long since dead.\"\r\n\r\nIn the earliest experiments attempts were made to secure the\r\nphotographs, reduced microscopically, arranged spirally on a cylinder\r\nabout the size of a phonograph record, and coated with a highly\r\nsensitized surface, the cylinder being given an intermittent movement,\r\nso as to be at rest during each exposure. Reproductions were obtained in\r\nthe same way, positive prints being observed through a magnifying glass.\r\nVarious forms of apparatus following this general type were made,\r\nbut they were all open to the serious objection that the very rapid\r\nemulsions employed were relatively coarse-grained and prevented the\r\nsecuring of sharp pictures of microscopic size. On the other hand, the\r\nenlarging of the apparatus to permit larger pictures to be obtained\r\nwould present too much weight to be stopped and started with the\r\nrequisite rapidity. In these early experiments, however, it was\r\nrecognized that, to secure proper results, a single camera should be\r\nused, so that the objects might move across its field just as they\r\nmove across the field of the human eye; and the important fact was\r\nalso observed that the rate at which persistence of vision took place\r\nrepresented the minimum speed at which the pictures should be obtained.\r\nIf, for instance, five pictures per second were taken (half of the time\r\nbeing occupied in exposure and the other half in moving the exposed\r\nportion of the film out of the field of the lens and bringing a new\r\nportion into its place), and the same ratio is observed in exhibiting\r\nthe pictures, the interval of time between successive pictures would\r\nbe one-tenth of a second; and for a normal eye such an exhibition would\r\npresent a substantially continuous photograph. If the angular movement\r\nof the object across the field is very slow, as, for instance, a distant\r\nvessel, the successive positions of the object are so nearly coincident\r\nthat when reproduced before the eye an impression of smooth, continuous\r\nmovement is secured. If, however, the object is moving rapidly across\r\nthe field of view, one picture will be separated from its successor to a\r\nmarked extent, and the resulting impression will be jerky and unnatural.\r\nRecognizing this fact, Edison always sought for a very high speed, so as\r\nto give smooth and natural reproductions, and even with his experimental\r\napparatus obtained upward of forty-eight pictures per second, whereas,\r\nin practice, at the present time, the accepted rate varies between\r\ntwenty and thirty per second. In the efforts of the present day\r\nto economize space by using a minimum length of film, pictures are\r\nfrequently taken at too slow a rate, and the reproductions are therefore\r\noften objectionable, by reason of more or less jerkiness.\r\n\r\nDuring the experimental period and up to the early part of 1889, the\r\nkodak film was being slowly developed by the Eastman Kodak Company.\r\nEdison perceived in this product the solution of the problem on which he\r\nhad been working, because the film presented a very light body of tough\r\nmaterial on which relatively large photographs could be taken at rapid\r\nintervals. The surface, however, was not at first sufficiently sensitive\r\nto admit of sharply defined pictures being secured at the necessarily\r\nhigh rates. It seemed apparent, therefore, that in order to obtain\r\nthe desired speed there would have to be sacrificed that fineness\r\nof emulsion necessary for the securing of sharp pictures. But as was\r\nsubsequently seen, this sacrifice was in time rendered unnecessary. Much\r\ncredit is due the Eastman experts--stimulated and encouraged by Edison,\r\nbut independently of him--for the production at last of a highly\r\nsensitized, fine-grained emulsion presenting the highly sensitized\r\nsurface that Edison sought.\r\n\r\nHaving at last obtained apparently the proper material upon which to\r\nsecure the photographs, the problem then remained to devise an apparatus\r\nby means of which from twenty to forty pictures per second could be\r\ntaken; the film being stationary during the exposure and, upon the\r\nclosing of the shutter, being moved to present a fresh surface. In\r\nconnection with this problem it is interesting to note that this\r\nquestion of high speed was apparently regarded by all Edison's\r\npredecessors as the crucial point. Ducos, for example, expended a great\r\ndeal of useless ingenuity in devising a camera by means of which a\r\ntape-line film could receive the photographs while being in continuous\r\nmovement, necessitating the use of a series of moving lenses. Another\r\nexperimenter, Dumont, made use of a single large plate and a great\r\nnumber of lenses which were successively exposed. Muybridge, as we have\r\nseen, used a series of cameras, one for each plate. Marey was limited to\r\na very few photographs, because the entire surface had to be stopped and\r\nstarted in connection with each exposure.\r\n\r\nAfter the accomplishment of the fact, it would seem to be the obvious\r\nthing to use a single lens and move the sensitized film with respect to\r\nit, intermittently bringing the surface to rest, then exposing it, then\r\ncutting off the light and moving the surface to a fresh position; but\r\nwho, other than Edison, would assume that such a device could be made\r\nto repeat these movements over and over again at the rate of twenty to\r\nforty per second? Users of kodaks and other forms of film cameras will\r\nappreciate perhaps better than others the difficulties of the problem,\r\nbecause in their work, after an exposure, they have to advance the\r\nfilm forward painfully to the extent of the next picture before another\r\nexposure can take place, these operations permitting of speeds of but\r\na few pictures per minute at best. Edison's solution of the problem\r\ninvolved the production of a kodak in which from twenty to forty\r\npictures should be taken IN EACH SECOND, and with such fineness of\r\nadjustment that each should exactly coincide with its predecessors even\r\nwhen subjected to the test of enlargement by projection. This, however,\r\nwas finally accomplished, and in the summer of 1889 the first modern\r\nmotion-picture camera was made. More than this, the mechanism for\r\noperating the film was so constructed that the movement of the film took\r\nplace in one-tenth of the time required for the exposure, giving the\r\nfilm an opportunity to come to rest prior to the opening of the shutter.\r\nFrom that day to this the Edison camera has been the accepted standard\r\nfor securing pictures of objects in motion, and such changes as have\r\nbeen made in it have been purely in the nature of detail mechanical\r\nrefinements.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of exhibiting apparatus, known as the Kinetoscope, was\r\na machine in which a positive print from the negative obtained in the\r\ncamera was exhibited directly to the eye through a peep-hole; but in\r\n1895 the films were applied to modified forms of magic lanterns, by\r\nwhich the images are projected upon a screen. Since that date the\r\nindustry has developed very rapidly, and at the present time (1910) all\r\nof the principal American manufacturers of motion pictures are paying a\r\nroyalty to Edison under his basic patents.\r\n\r\nFrom the early days of pictures representing simple movements, such as\r\na man sneezing, or a skirt-dance, there has been a gradual evolution,\r\nuntil now the pictures represent not only actual events in all their\r\npalpitating instantaneity, but highly developed dramas and scenarios\r\nenacted in large, well-equipped glass studios, and the result of\r\ninfinite pains and expense of production. These pictures are exhibited\r\nin upward of eight thousand places of amusement in the United States,\r\nand are witnessed by millions of people each year. They constitute a\r\ncheap, clean form of amusement for many persons who cannot spare the\r\nmoney to go to the ordinary theatres, or they may be exhibited in towns\r\nthat are too small to support a theatre. More than this, they offer\r\nto the poor man an effective substitute for the saloon. Probably no\r\ninvention ever made has afforded more pleasure and entertainment than\r\nthe motion picture.\r\n\r\nAside from the development of the motion picture as a spectacle, there\r\nhas gone on an evolution in its use for educational purposes of wide\r\nrange, which must not be overlooked. In fact, this form of utilization\r\nhas been carried further in Europe than in this country as a means of\r\ndemonstration in the arts and sciences. One may study animal life, watch\r\na surgical operation, follow the movement of machinery, take lessons\r\nin facial expression or in calisthenics. It seems a pity that in motion\r\npictures should at last have been found the only competition that the\r\nancient marionettes cannot withstand. But aside from the disappearance\r\nof those entertaining puppets, all else is gain in the creation of this\r\nnew art.\r\n\r\nThe work at the Edison laboratory in the development of the motion\r\npicture was as usual intense and concentrated, and, as might be\r\nexpected, many of the early experiments were quite primitive in\r\ntheir character until command had been secured of relatively perfect\r\napparatus. The subjects registered jerkily by the films were crude and\r\namusing, such as of Fred Ott's sneeze, Carmencita dancing, Italians\r\nand their performing bears, fencing, trapeze stunts, horsemanship,\r\nblacksmithing--just simple movements without any attempt to portray the\r\nsilent drama. One curious incident of this early study occurred when\r\n\"Jim\" Corbett was asked to box a few rounds in front of the camera, with\r\na \"dark un\" to be selected locally. This was agreed to, and a celebrated\r\nbruiser was brought over from Newark. When this \"sparring partner\" came\r\nto face Corbett in the imitation ring he was so paralyzed with terror\r\nhe could hardly move. It was just after Corbett had won one of his\r\nbig battles as a prize-fighter, and the dismay of his opponent was\r\nexcusable. The \"boys\" at the laboratory still laugh consumedly when they\r\ntell about it.\r\n\r\nThe first motion-picture studio was dubbed by the staff the \"Black\r\nMaria.\" It was an unpretentious oblong wooden structure erected in the\r\nlaboratory yard, and had a movable roof in the central part. This roof\r\ncould be raised or lowered at will. The building was covered with black\r\nroofing paper, and was also painted black inside. There was no scenery\r\nto render gay this lugubrious environment, but the black interior served\r\nas the common background for the performers, throwing all their actions\r\ninto high relief. The whole structure was set on a pivot so that it\r\ncould be swung around with the sun; and the movable roof was opened\r\nso that the accentuating sunlight could stream in upon the actor whose\r\ngesticulations were being caught by the camera. These beginnings and\r\ncrudities are very remote from the elaborate and expensive paraphernalia\r\nand machinery with which the art is furnished to-day.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the studios in which motion pictures are taken are\r\nexpensive and pretentious affairs. An immense building of glass, with\r\nall the properties and stage-settings of a regular theatre, is required.\r\nThe Bronx Park studio of the Edison company cost at least one hundred\r\nthousand dollars, while the well-known house of Pathe Freres in\r\nFrance--one of Edison's licensees--makes use of no fewer than seven of\r\nthese glass theatres. All of the larger producers of pictures in this\r\ncountry and abroad employ regular stock companies of actors, men and\r\nwomen selected especially for their skill in pantomime, although, as\r\nmost observers have perhaps suspected, in the actual taking of the\r\npictures the performers are required to carry on an animated and\r\nprepared dialogue with the same spirit and animation as on the regular\r\nstage. Before setting out on the preparation of a picture, the book is\r\nfirst written--known in the business as a scenario--giving a complete\r\nstatement as to the scenery, drops and background, and the sequence of\r\nevents, divided into scenes as in an ordinary play. These are placed in\r\nthe hands of a \"producer,\" corresponding to a stage-director, generally\r\nan actor or theatrical man of experience, with a highly developed\r\ndramatic instinct. The various actors are selected, parts are assigned,\r\nand the scene-painters are set to work on the production of the\r\ndesired scenery. Before the photographing of a scene, a long series of\r\nrehearsals takes place, the incidents being gone over and over again\r\nuntil the actors are \"letter perfect.\" So persistent are the producers\r\nin the matter of rehearsals and the refining and elaboration of\r\ndetails, that frequently a picture that may be actually photographed and\r\nreproduced in fifteen minutes, may require two or three weeks for its\r\nproduction. After the rehearsal of a scene has advanced sufficiently\r\nto suit the critical requirements of the producer, the camera man is\r\nin requisition, and he is consulted as to lighting so as to produce the\r\nrequired photographic effect. Preferably, of course, sunlight is used\r\nwhenever possible, hence the glass studios; but on dark days, and when\r\nnight-work is necessary, artificial light of enormous candle-power\r\nis used, either mercury arcs or ordinary arc lights of great size and\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nUnder all conditions the light is properly screened and diffused to suit\r\nthe critical eye of the camera man. All being in readiness, the actual\r\npicture is taken, the actors going through their rehearsed parts, the\r\nproducer standing out of the range of the camera, and with a megaphone\r\nto his lips yelling out his instructions, imprecations, and approval,\r\nand the camera man grinding at the crank of the camera and securing the\r\npictures at the rate of twenty or more per second, making a faithful\r\nand permanent record of every movement and every change of facial\r\nexpression. At the end of the scene the negative is developed in the\r\nordinary way, and is then ready for use in the printing of the positives\r\nfor sale. When a further scene in the play takes place in the same\r\nsetting, and without regard to its position in the plot, it is taken\r\nup, rehearsed, and photographed in the same way, and afterward all\r\nthe scenes are cemented together in the proper sequence, and form\r\nthe complete negative. Frequently, therefore, in the production of\r\na motion-picture play, the first and the last scene may be taken\r\nsuccessively, the only thing necessary being, of course, that after all\r\nis done the various scenes should be arranged in their proper order. The\r\nframes, having served their purpose, now go back to the scene-painter\r\nfor further use. All pictures are not taken in studios, because when\r\nlight and weather permit and proper surroundings can be secured outside,\r\nscenes can best be obtained with natural scenery--city streets, woods,\r\nand fields. The great drawback to the taking of pictures out-of-doors,\r\nhowever, is the inevitable crowd, attracted by the novelty of the\r\nproceedings, which makes the camera man's life a torment by getting into\r\nthe field of his instrument. The crowds are patient, however, and in one\r\nEdison picture involving the blowing up of a bridge by the villain\r\nof the piece and the substitution of a pontoon bridge by a company\r\nof engineers just in time to allow the heroine to pass over in her\r\nautomobile, more than a thousand people stood around for almost an\r\nentire day waiting for the tedious rehearsals to end and the actual\r\nperformance to begin. Frequently large bodies of men are used in\r\npictures, such as troops of soldiers, and it is an open secret that for\r\nweeks during the Boer War regularly equipped British and Boer armies\r\nconfronted each other on the peaceful hills of Orange, New Jersey, ready\r\nto enact before the camera the stirring events told by the cable from\r\nthe seat of hostilities. These conflicts were essentially harmless,\r\nexcept in one case during the battle of Spion Kopje, when \"General\r\nCronje,\" in his efforts to fire a wooden cannon, inadvertently dropped\r\nhis fuse into a large glass bottle containing gunpowder. The effect was\r\ncertainly most dramatic, and created great enthusiasm among the many\r\naudiences which viewed the completed production; but the unfortunate\r\ngeneral, who is still an employee, was taken to the hospital, and even\r\nnow, twelve years afterward, he says with a grin that whenever he has a\r\nmoment of leisure he takes the time to pick a few pieces of glass from\r\nhis person!\r\n\r\nEdison's great contribution to the regular stage was the incandescent\r\nelectric lamp, which enabled the production of scenic effects\r\nnever before even dreamed of, but which we accept now with so much\r\ncomplacency. Yet with the motion picture, effects are secured that\r\ncould not be reproduced to the slightest extent on the real stage. The\r\nvillain, overcome by a remorseful conscience, sees on the wall of the\r\nroom the very crime which he committed, with HIMSELF as the principal\r\nactor; one of the easy effects of double exposure. The substantial and\r\nofttimes corpulent ghost or spirit of the real stage has been succeeded\r\nby an intangible wraith, as transparent and unsubstantial as may be\r\ndemanded in the best book of fairy tales--more double exposure. A man\r\nemerges from the water with a splash, ascends feet foremost ten yards or\r\nmore, makes a graceful curve and lands on a spring-board, runs down it\r\nto the bank, and his clothes fly gently up from the ground and enclose\r\nhis person--all unthinkable in real life, but readily possible by\r\nrunning the motion-picture film backward! The fairy prince commands the\r\nprincess to appear, consigns the bad brothers to instant annihilation,\r\nturns the witch into a cat, confers life on inanimate things; and many\r\nmore startling and apparently incomprehensible effects are carried out\r\nwith actual reality, by stop-work photography. In one case, when the\r\ncommand for the heroine to come forth is given, the camera is stopped,\r\nthe young woman walks to the desired spot, and the camera is again\r\nstarted; the effect to the eye--not knowing of this little by-play--is\r\nas if she had instantly appeared from space. The other effects are\r\nperhaps obvious, and the field and opportunities are absolutely\r\nunlimited. Other curious effects are secured by taking the pictures at a\r\ndifferent speed from that at which they are exhibited. If, for example,\r\na scene occupying thirty seconds is reproduced in ten seconds, the\r\nmovements will be three times as fast, and vice versa. Many scenes\r\nfamiliar to the reader, showing automobiles tearing along the road and\r\nrounding corners at an apparently reckless speed, are really pictures of\r\nslow and dignified movements reproduced at a high speed.\r\n\r\nBrief reference has been made to motion pictures of educational\r\nsubjects, and in this field there are very great opportunities for\r\ndevelopment. The study of geography, scenes and incidents in foreign\r\ncountries, showing the lives and customs and surroundings of other\r\npeoples, is obviously more entertaining to the child when actively\r\ndepicted on the screen than when merely described in words. The lives of\r\ngreat men, the enacting of important historical events, the reproduction\r\nof great works of literature, if visually presented to the child must\r\nnecessarily impress his mind with greater force than if shown by mere\r\nwords. We predict that the time is not far distant when, in many of\r\nour public schools, two or three hours a week will be devoted to this\r\nrational and effective form of education.\r\n\r\nBy applying microphotography to motion pictures an additional field\r\nis opened up, one phase of which may be the study of germ life and\r\nbacteria, so that our future medical students may become as familiar\r\nwith the habits and customs of the Anthrax bacillus, for example, as of\r\nthe domestic cat.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point of view the subject is approached, the fact remains\r\nthat in the motion picture, perhaps more than with any other invention,\r\nEdison has created an art that must always make a special appeal to the\r\nmind and emotions of men, and although so far it has not advanced much\r\nbeyond the field of amusement, it contains enormous possibilities for\r\nserious development in the future. Let us not think too lightly of the\r\nhumble five-cent theatre with its gaping crowd following with breathless\r\ninterest the vicissitudes of the beautiful heroine. Before us lies an\r\nundeveloped land of opportunity which is destined to play an important\r\npart in the growth and welfare of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EDISON STORAGE BATTERY\r\n\r\nIT is more than a hundred years since the elementary principle of the\r\nstorage battery or \"accumulator\" was detected by a Frenchman named\r\nGautherot; it is just fifty years since another Frenchman, named Plante,\r\ndiscovered that on taking two thin plates of sheet lead, immersing them\r\nin dilute sulphuric acid, and passing an electric current through the\r\ncell, the combination exhibited the ability to give back part of the\r\noriginal charging current, owing to the chemical changes and reactions\r\nset up. Plante coiled up his sheets into a very handy cell like a little\r\nroll of carpet or pastry; but the trouble was that the battery took a\r\nlong time to \"form.\" One sheet becoming coated with lead peroxide\r\nand the other with finely divided or spongy metallic lead, they would\r\nreceive current, and then, even after a long period of inaction, furnish\r\nor return an electromotive force of from 1.85 to 2.2 volts. This ability\r\nto store up electrical energy produced by dynamos in hours otherwise\r\nidle, whether driven by steam, wind, or water, was a distinct advance\r\nin the art; but the sensational step was taken about 1880, when Faure in\r\nFrance and Brush in America broke away from the slow and weary process\r\nof \"forming\" the plates, and hit on clever methods of furnishing them\r\n\"ready made,\" so to speak, by dabbing red lead onto lead-grid plates,\r\njust as butter is spread on a slice of home-made bread. This brought the\r\nstorage battery at once into use as a practical, manufactured piece of\r\napparatus; and the world was captivated with the idea. The great English\r\nscientist, Sir William Thomson, went wild with enthusiasm when a\r\nFaure \"box of electricity\" was brought over from Paris to him in 1881\r\ncontaining a million foot-pounds of stored energy. His biographer, Dr.\r\nSylvanus P. Thompson, describes him as lying ill in bed with a wounded\r\nleg, and watching results with an incandescent lamp fastened to his bed\r\ncurtain by a safety-pin, and lit up by current from the little Faure\r\ncell. Said Sir William: \"It is going to be a most valuable, practical\r\naffair--as valuable as water-cisterns to people whether they had or had\r\nnot systems of water-pipes and water-supply.\" Indeed, in one outburst of\r\npanegyric the shrewd physicist remarked that he saw in it \"a realization\r\nof the most ardently and increasingly felt scientific aspiration of his\r\nlife--an aspiration which he hardly dared to expect or to see realized.\"\r\nA little later, however, Sir William, always cautious and canny,\r\nbegan to discover the inherent defects of the primitive battery, as\r\nto disintegration, inefficiency, costliness, etc., and though offered\r\ntempting inducements, declined to lend his name to its financial\r\nintroduction. Nevertheless, he accepted the principle as valuable, and\r\nput the battery to actual use.\r\n\r\nFor many years after this episode, the modern lead-lead type of battery\r\nthus brought forward with so great a flourish of trumpets had a hard\r\ntime of it. Edison's attitude toward it, even as a useful supplement\r\nto his lighting system, was always one of scepticism, and he remarked\r\ncontemptuously that the best storage battery he knew was a ton of coal.\r\nThe financial fortunes of the battery, on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nwere as varied and as disastrous as its industrial; but it did at last\r\nemerge, and \"made good.\" By 1905, the production of lead-lead storage\r\nbatteries in the United States alone had reached a value for the year\r\nof nearly $3,000,000, and it has increased greatly since that time.\r\nThe storage battery is now regarded as an important and indispensable\r\nadjunct in nearly all modern electric-lighting and electric-railway\r\nsystems of any magnitude; and in 1909, in spite of its weight, it had\r\nfound adoption in over ten thousand automobiles of the truck, delivery\r\nwagon, pleasure carriage, and runabout types in America.\r\n\r\nEdison watched closely all this earlier development for about fifteen\r\nyears, not changing his mind as to what he regarded as the incurable\r\ndefects of the lead-lead type, but coming gradually to the conclusion\r\nthat if a storage battery of some other and better type could be brought\r\nforward, it would fulfil all the early hopes, however extravagant, of\r\nsuch men as Kelvin (Sir William Thomson), and would become as necessary\r\nand as universal as the incandescent lamp or the electric motor.\r\nThe beginning of the present century found him at his point of new\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, non-technical and uninitiated persons have a\r\ntendency to regard an invention as being more or less the ultimate\r\nresult of some happy inspiration. And, indeed, there is no doubt that\r\nsuch may be the fact in some instances; but in most cases the inventor\r\nhas intentionally set out to accomplish a definite and desired\r\nresult--mostly through the application of the known laws of the art in\r\nwhich he happens to be working. It is rarely, however, that a man will\r\nstart out deliberately, as Edison did, to evolve a radically new type of\r\nsuch an intricate device as the storage battery, with only a meagre clew\r\nand a vague starting-point.\r\n\r\nIn view of the successful outcome of the problem which, in 1900, he\r\nundertook to solve, it will be interesting to review his mental attitude\r\nat that period. It has already been noted at the end of a previous\r\nchapter that on closing the magnetic iron-ore concentrating plant\r\nat Edison, New Jersey, he resolved to work on a new type of storage\r\nbattery. It was about this time that, in the course of a conversation\r\nwith Mr. R. H. Beach, then of the street-railway department of the\r\nGeneral Electric Company, he said: \"Beach, I don't think Nature would be\r\nso unkind as to withhold the secret of a GOOD storage battery if a real\r\nearnest hunt for it is made. I'm going to hunt.\"\r\n\r\nFrequently Edison has been asked what he considers the secret of\r\nachievement. To this query he has invariably replied: \"Hard work, based\r\non hard thinking.\" The laboratory records bear the fullest witness that\r\nhe has consistently followed out this prescription to the utmost. The\r\nperfection of all his great inventions has been signalized by patient,\r\npersistent, and incessant effort which, recognizing nothing short of\r\nsuccess, has resulted in the ultimate accomplishment of his ideas.\r\nOptimistic and hopeful to a high degree, Edison has the happy faculty of\r\nbeginning the day as open-minded as a child--yesterday's disappointments\r\nand failures discarded and discounted by the alluring possibilities of\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nOf all his inventions, it is doubtful whether any one of them has\r\ncalled forth more original thought, work, perseverance, ingenuity, and\r\nmonumental patience than the one we are now dealing with. One of his\r\nassociates who has been through the many years of the storage-battery\r\ndrudgery with him said: \"If Edison's experiments, investigations, and\r\nwork on this storage battery were all that he had ever done, I should\r\nsay that he was not only a notable inventor, but also a great man. It is\r\nalmost impossible to appreciate the enormous difficulties that have been\r\novercome.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a beginning which was made practically in the dark, it was not\r\nuntil he had completed more than ten thousand experiments that he\r\nobtained any positive preliminary results whatever. Through all\r\nthis vast amount of research there had been no previous signs of the\r\nelectrical action he was looking for. These experiments had extended\r\nover many months of constant work by day and night, but there was no\r\nbreakdown of Edison's faith in ultimate success--no diminution of his\r\nsanguine and confident expectations. The failure of an experiment simply\r\nmeant to him that he had found something else that would not work, thus\r\nbringing the possible goal a little nearer by a process of painstaking\r\nelimination.\r\n\r\nNow, however, after these many months of arduous toil, in which he\r\nhad examined and tested practically all the known elements in numerous\r\nchemical combinations, the electric action he sought for had been\r\nobtained, thus affording him the first inkling of the secret that he\r\nhad industriously tried to wrest from Nature. It should be borne in\r\nmind that from the very outset Edison had disdained any intention of\r\nfollowing in the only tracks then known by employing lead and sulphuric\r\nacid as the components of a successful storage battery. Impressed with\r\nwhat he considered the serious inherent defects of batteries made of\r\nthese materials, and the tremendously complex nature of the chemical\r\nreactions taking place in all types of such cells, he determined boldly\r\nat the start that he would devise a battery without lead, and one in\r\nwhich an alkaline solution could be used--a form which would, he firmly\r\nbelieved, be inherently less subject to decay and dissolution than the\r\nstandard type, which after many setbacks had finally won its way to an\r\nannual production of many thousands of cells, worth millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nTwo or three thousand of the first experiments followed the line of his\r\nwell-known primary battery in the attempted employment of copper oxide\r\nas an element in a new type of storage cell; but its use offered no\r\nadvantages, and the hunt was continued in other directions and pursued\r\nuntil Edison satisfied himself by a vast number of experiments that\r\nnickel and iron possessed the desirable qualifications he was in search\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThis immense amount of investigation which had consumed so many months\r\nof time, and which had culminated in the discovery of a series of\r\nreactions between nickel and iron that bore great promise, brought\r\nEdison merely within sight of a strange and hitherto unexplored\r\ncountry. Slowly but surely the results of the last few thousands of his\r\npreliminary experiments had pointed inevitably to a new and fruitful\r\nregion ahead. He had discovered the hidden passage and held the clew\r\nwhich he had so industriously sought. And now, having outlined a\r\ndefinite path, Edison was all afire to push ahead vigorously in order\r\nthat he might enter in and possess the land.\r\n\r\nIt is a trite saying that \"history repeats itself,\" and certainly no\r\naxiom carries more truth than this when applied to the history of each\r\nof Edison's important inventions. The development of the storage battery\r\nhas been no exception; indeed, far from otherwise, for in the ten years\r\nthat have elapsed since the time he set himself and his mechanics,\r\nchemists, machinists, and experimenters at work to develop a practical\r\ncommercial cell, the old story of incessant and persistent efforts so\r\nmanifest in the working out of other inventions was fully repeated.\r\n\r\nVery soon after he had decided upon the use of nickel and iron as the\r\nelemental metals for his storage battery, Edison established a\r\nchemical plant at Silver Lake, New Jersey, a few miles from the Orange\r\nlaboratory, on land purchased some time previously. This place was the\r\nscene of the further experiments to develop the various chemical forms\r\nof nickel and iron, and to determine by tests what would be best adapted\r\nfor use in cells manufactured on a commercial scale. With a little\r\nhandful of selected experimenters gathered about him, Edison settled\r\ndown to one of his characteristic struggles for supremacy. To some\r\nextent it was a revival of the old Menlo Park days (or, rather, nights).\r\nSome of these who had worked on the preliminary experiments, with the\r\naddition of a few new-comers, toiled together regardless of passing\r\ntime and often under most discouraging circumstances, but with that\r\nremarkable esprit de corps that has ever marked Edison's relations with\r\nhis co-workers, and that has contributed so largely to the successful\r\ncarrying out of his ideas.\r\n\r\nThe group that took part in these early years of Edison's arduous labors\r\nincluded his old-time assistant, Fred Ott, together with his chemist,\r\nJ. W. Aylsworth, as well as E. J. Ross, Jr., W. E. Holland, and Ralph\r\nArbogast, and a little later W. G. Bee, all of whom have grown up\r\nwith the battery and still devote their energies to its commercial\r\ndevelopment. One of these workers, relating the strenuous experiences of\r\nthese few years, says: \"It was hard work and long hours, but still\r\nthere were some things that made life pleasant. One of them was the\r\nsupper-hour we enjoyed when we worked nights. Mr. Edison would have\r\nsupper sent in about midnight, and we all sat down together, including\r\nhimself. Work was forgotten for the time, and all hands were ready for\r\nfun. I have very pleasant recollections of Mr. Edison at these times. He\r\nwould always relax and help to make a good time, and on some occasions\r\nI have seen him fairly overflow with animal spirits, just like a boy\r\nlet out from school. After the supper-hour was over, however, he again\r\nbecame the serious, energetic inventor, deeply immersed in the work at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"He was very fond of telling and hearing stories, and always appreciated\r\na joke. I remember one that he liked to get off on us once in a while.\r\nOur lighting plant was in duplicate, and about 12.30 or 1 o'clock in the\r\nmorning, at the close of the supper-hour, a change would be made from\r\none plant to the other, involving the gradual extinction of the electric\r\nlights and their slowly coming up to candle-power again, the whole\r\nchange requiring probably about thirty seconds. Sometimes, as this was\r\ntaking place, Edison would fold his hands, compose himself as if he were\r\nin sound sleep, and when the lights were full again would apparently\r\nwake up, with the remark, 'Well, boys, we've had a fine rest; now let's\r\npitch into work again.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother interesting and amusing reminiscence of this period of\r\nactivity has been gathered from another of the family of experimenters:\r\n\"Sometimes, when Mr. Edison had been working long hours, he would\r\nwant to have a short sleep. It was one of the funniest things I ever\r\nwitnessed to see him crawl into an ordinary roll-top desk and curl up\r\nand take a nap. If there was a sight that was still more funny, it was\r\nto see him turn over on his other side, all the time remaining in the\r\ndesk. He would use several volumes of Watts's Dictionary of Chemistry\r\nfor a pillow, and we fellows used to say that he absorbed the contents\r\nduring his sleep, judging from the flow of new ideas he had on waking.\"\r\n\r\nSuch incidents as these serve merely to illustrate the lighter moments\r\nthat stand out in relief against the more sombre background of the\r\nstrenuous years, for, of all the absorbingly busy periods of Edison's\r\ninventive life, the first five years of the storage-battery era was\r\none of the very busiest of them all. It was not that there remained any\r\nbasic principle to be discovered or simplified, for that had already\r\nbeen done; but it was in the effort to carry these principles into\r\npractice that there arose the numerous difficulties that at times seemed\r\ninsurmountable. But, according to another co-worker, \"Edison seemed\r\npleased when he used to run up against a serious difficulty. It would\r\nseem to stiffen his backbone and make him more prolific of new ideas.\r\nFor a time I thought I was foolish to imagine such a thing, but I could\r\nnever get away from the impression that he really appeared happy when\r\nhe ran up against a serious snag. That was in my green days, and I soon\r\nlearned that the failure of an experiment never discourages him unless\r\nit is by reason of the carelessness of the man making it. Then Edison\r\ngets disgusted. If it fails on its merits, he doesn't worry or fret\r\nabout it, but, on the contrary, regards it as a useful fact learned;\r\nremains cheerful and tries something else. I have known him to reverse\r\nan unsuccessful experiment and come out all right.\"\r\n\r\nTo follow Edison's trail in detail through the innumerable twists and\r\nturns of his experimentation and research on the storage battery, during\r\nthe past ten years, would not be in keeping with the scope of this\r\nnarrative, nor would it serve any useful purpose. Besides, such details\r\nwould fill a big volume. The narrative, however, would not be complete\r\nwithout some mention of the general outline of his work, and reference\r\nmay be made briefly to a few of the chief items. And lest the reader\r\nthink that the word \"innumerable\" may have been carelessly or hastily\r\nused above, we would quote the reply of one of the laboratory assistants\r\nwhen asked how many experiments had been made on the Edison storage\r\nbattery since the year 1900: \"Goodness only knows! We used to number our\r\nexperiments consecutively from 1 to 10,000, and when we got up to\r\n10,000 we turned back to 1 and ran up to 10,000 again, and so on. We ran\r\nthrough several series--I don't know how many, and have lost track of\r\nthem now, but it was not far from fifty thousand.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the very first, Edison's broad idea of his storage battery was to\r\nmake perforated metallic containers having the active materials packed\r\ntherein; nickel hydrate for the positive and iron oxide for the negative\r\nplate. This plan has been adhered to throughout, and has found its\r\nconsummation in the present form of the completed commercial cell, but\r\nin the middle ground which stands between the early crude beginnings\r\nand the perfected type of to-day there lies a world of original thought,\r\npatient plodding, and achievement.\r\n\r\nThe first necessity was naturally to obtain the best and purest\r\ncompounds for active materials. Edison found that comparatively little\r\nwas known by manufacturing chemists about nickel and iron oxides of the\r\nhigh grade and purity he required. Hence it became necessary for him to\r\nestablish his own chemical works and put them in charge of men specially\r\ntrained by himself, with whom he worked. This was the plant at Silver\r\nLake, above referred to. Here, for several years, there was ceaseless\r\nactivity in the preparation of these chemical compounds by every\r\nimaginable process and subsequent testing. Edison's chief chemist says:\r\n\"We left no stone unturned to find a way of making those chemicals so\r\nthat they would give the highest results. We carried on the experiments\r\nwith the two chemicals together. Sometimes the nickel would be ahead\r\nin the tests, and then again it would fall behind. To stimulate us to\r\ngreater improvement, Edison hung up a card which showed the results\r\nof tests in milliampere-hours given by the experimental elements as we\r\ntried them with the various grades of nickel and iron we had made. This\r\nstirred up a great deal of ambition among the boys to push the figures\r\nup. Some of our earliest tests showed around 300, but as we improved\r\nthe material, they gradually crept up to over 500. Just about that time\r\nEdison made a trip to Canada, and when he came back we had made such\r\ngood progress that the figures had crept up to about 1000. I well\r\nremember how greatly he was pleased.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the development of the negative element of the battery,\r\nMr. Aylsworth said: \"In like manner the iron element had to be developed\r\nand improved; and finally the iron, which had generally enjoyed\r\nsuperiority in capacity over its companion, the nickel element, had to\r\ngo in training in order to retain its lead, which was imperative, in\r\norder to produce a uniform and constant voltage curve. In talking\r\nwith me one day about the difficulties under which we were working and\r\ncontrasting them with the phonograph experimentation, Edison said: 'In\r\nphonographic work we can use our ears and our eyes, aided with powerful\r\nmicroscopes; but in the battery our difficulties cannot be seen or\r\nheard, but must be observed by our mind's eye!' And by reason of the\r\nemployment of such vision in the past, Edison is now able to see quite\r\nclearly through the forest of difficulties after eliminating them one by\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nThe size and shape of the containing pockets in the battery plates or\r\nelements and the degree of their perforation were matters that received\r\nmany years of close study and experiment; indeed, there is still to-day\r\nconstant work expended on their perfection, although their present\r\ngeneral form was decided upon several years ago. The mechanical\r\nconstruction of the battery, as a whole, in its present form, compels\r\ninstant admiration on account of its beauty and completeness. Mr. Edison\r\nhas spared neither thought, ingenuity, labor, nor money in the effort to\r\nmake it the most complete and efficient storage cell obtainable, and the\r\nresults show that his skill, judgment, and foresight have lost nothing\r\nof the power that laid the foundation of, and built up, other great arts\r\nat each earlier stage of his career.\r\n\r\nAmong the complex and numerous problems that presented themselves in\r\nthe evolution of the battery was the one concerning the internal\r\nconductivity of the positive unit. The nickel hydrate was a poor\r\nelectrical conductor, and although a metallic nickel pocket might be\r\nfilled with it, there would not be the desired electrical action unless\r\na conducting substance were mixed with it, and so incorporated and\r\npacked that there would be good electrical contact throughout.\r\nThis proved to be a most knotty and intricate puzzle--tricky and\r\nevasive--always leading on and promising something, and at the last\r\nslipping away leaving the work undone. Edison's remarkable patience and\r\npersistence in dealing with this trying problem and in finally solving\r\nit successfully won for him more than ordinary admiration from his\r\nassociates. One of them, in speaking of the seemingly interminable\r\nexperiments to overcome this trouble, said: \"I guess that question of\r\nconductivity of the positive pocket brought lots of gray hairs to his\r\nhead. I never dreamed a man could have such patience and perseverance.\r\nAny other man than Edison would have given the whole thing up a thousand\r\ntimes, but not he! Things looked awfully blue to the whole bunch of\r\nus many a time, but he was always hopeful. I remember one time things\r\nlooked so dark to me that I had just about made up my mind to throw up\r\nmy job, but some good turn came just then and I didn't. Now I'm glad I\r\nheld on, for we've got a great future.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of obtaining good electrical contact in the positive\r\nelement was indeed Edison's chief trouble for many years. After a great\r\namount of work and experimentation he decided upon a certain form\r\nof graphite, which seemed to be suitable for the purpose, and then\r\nproceeded to the commercial manufacture of the battery at a special\r\nfactory in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, installed for the purpose. There was\r\nno lack of buyers, but, on the contrary, the factory was unable to turn\r\nout batteries enough. The newspapers had previously published articles\r\nshowing the unusual capacity and performance of the battery, and public\r\ninterest had thus been greatly awakened.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the establishment of a regular routine of manufacture\r\nand sale, Edison did not cease to experiment for improvement. Although\r\nthe graphite apparently did the work desired of it, he was not\r\naltogether satisfied with its performance and made extended trials\r\nof other substances, but at that time found nothing that on the whole\r\nserved the purpose better. Continuous tests of the commercial cells were\r\ncarried on at the laboratory, as well as more practical and heavy tests\r\nin automobiles, which were constantly kept running around the adjoining\r\ncountry over all kinds of roads. All these tests were very closely\r\nwatched by Edison, who demanded rigorously that the various trials of\r\nthe battery should be carried on with all strenuousness so as to get the\r\nutmost results and develop any possible weakness. So insistent was he on\r\nthis, that if any automobile should run several days without bursting a\r\ntire or breaking some part of the machine, he would accuse the chauffeur\r\nof picking out easy roads.\r\n\r\nAfter these tests had been going on for some time, and some thousands\r\nof cells had been sold and were giving satisfactory results to the\r\npurchasers, the test sheets and experience gathered from various sources\r\npointed to the fact that occasionally a cell here and there would show\r\nup as being short in capacity. Inasmuch as the factory processes were\r\nvery exact and carefully guarded, and every cell was made as uniform as\r\nhuman skill and care could provide, there thus arose a serious problem.\r\nEdison concentrated his powers on the investigation of this trouble, and\r\nfound that the chief cause lay in the graphite. Some other minor matters\r\nalso attracted his attention. What to do, was the important question\r\nthat confronted him. To shut down the factory meant great loss and\r\napparent failure. He realized this fully, but he also knew that to go\r\non would simply be to increase the number of defective batteries in\r\ncirculation, which would ultimately result in a permanent closure\r\nand real failure. Hence he took the course which one would expect of\r\nEdison's common sense and directness of action. He was not satisfied\r\nthat the battery was a complete success, so he shut down and went to\r\nexperimenting once more.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" says one of the laboratory men, \"we started on another\r\nseries of record-breaking experiments that lasted over five years.\r\nI might almost say heart-breaking, too, for of all the elusive,\r\ndisappointing things one ever hunted for that was the worst. But secrets\r\nhave to be long-winded and roost high if they want to get away when the\r\n'Old Man' goes hunting for them. He doesn't get mad when he misses them,\r\nbut just keeps on smiling and firing, and usually brings them into camp.\r\nThat's what he did on the battery, for after a whole lot of work he\r\nperfected the nickel-flake idea and process, besides making the great\r\nimprovement of using tubes instead of flat pockets for the positive. He\r\nalso added a minor improvement here and there, and now we have a finer\r\nbattery than we ever expected.\"\r\n\r\nIn the interim, while the experimentation of these last five years was\r\nin progress, many customers who had purchased batteries of the original\r\ntype came knocking at the door with orders in their hands for additional\r\noutfits wherewith to equip more wagons and trucks. Edison expressed\r\nhis regrets, but said he was not satisfied with the old cells and was\r\nengaged in improving them. To which the customers replied that THEY were\r\nentirely satisfied and ready and willing to pay for more batteries of\r\nthe same kind; but Edison could not be moved from his determination,\r\nalthough considerable pressure was at times brought to bear to sway his\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nExperiment was continued beyond the point of peradventure, and after\r\nsome new machinery had been built, the manufacture of the new type of\r\ncell was begun in the early summer of 1909, and at the present writing\r\nis being extended as fast as the necessary additional machinery can be\r\nmade. The product is shipped out as soon as it is completed.\r\n\r\nThe nickel flake, which is Edison's ingenious solution of the\r\nconductivity problem, is of itself a most interesting product, intensely\r\npractical in its application and fascinating in its manufacture. The\r\nflake of nickel is obtained by electroplating upon a metallic cylinder\r\nalternate layers of copper and nickel, one hundred of each, after which\r\nthe combined sheet is stripped from the cylinder. So thin are the layers\r\nthat this sheet is only about the thickness of a visiting-card, and yet\r\nit is composed of two hundred layers of metal. The sheet is cut into\r\ntiny squares, each about one-sixteenth of an inch, and these squares\r\nare put into a bath where the copper is dissolved out. This releases\r\nthe layers of nickel, so that each of these small squares becomes one\r\nhundred tiny sheets, or flakes, of pure metallic nickel, so thin that\r\nwhen they are dried they will float in the air, like thistle-down.\r\n\r\nIn their application to the manufacture of batteries, the flakes are\r\nused through the medium of a special machine, so arranged that small\r\ncharges of nickel hydrate and nickel flake are alternately fed into the\r\npockets intended for positives, and tamped down with a pressure equal\r\nto about four tons per square inch. This insures complete and perfect\r\ncontact and consequent electrical conductivity throughout the entire\r\nunit.\r\n\r\nThe development of the nickel flake contains in itself a history of\r\npatient investigation, labor, and achievement, but we have not space for\r\nit, nor for tracing the great work that has been done in developing\r\nand perfecting the numerous other parts and adjuncts of this remarkable\r\nbattery. Suffice it to say that when Edison went boldly out into new\r\nterritory, after something entirely unknown, he was quite prepared for\r\nhard work and exploration. He encountered both in unstinted measure, but\r\nkept on going forward until, after long travel, he had found all that he\r\nexpected and accomplished something more beside. Nature DID respond to\r\nhis whole-hearted appeal, and, by the time the hunt was ended, revealed\r\na good storage battery of entirely new type. Edison not only recognized\r\nand took advantage of the principles he had discovered, but in\r\nadapting them for commercial use developed most ingenious processes\r\nand mechanical appliances for carrying his discoveries into practical\r\neffect. Indeed, it may be said that the invention of an enormous variety\r\nof new machines and mechanical appliances rendered necessary by each\r\nchange during the various stages of development of the battery, from\r\nfirst to last, stands as a lasting tribute to the range and versatility\r\nof his powers.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this narrative to enter into any\r\ndescription of the relative merits of the Edison storage battery, that\r\nbeing the province of a commercial catalogue. It does, however, seem\r\nentirely allowable to say that while at the present writing the tests\r\nthat have been made extend over a few years only, their results and the\r\nintrinsic value of this characteristic Edison invention are of such a\r\nsubstantial nature as to point to the inevitable growth of another\r\ngreat industry arising from its manufacture, and to its wide-spread\r\napplication to many uses.\r\n\r\nThe principal use that Edison has had in mind for his battery is\r\ntransportation of freight and passengers by truck, automobile, and\r\nstreet-car. The greatly increased capacity in proportion to weight of\r\nthe Edison cell makes it particularly adaptable for this class of work\r\non account of the much greater radius of travel that is possible by its\r\nuse. The latter point of advantage is the one that appeals most to the\r\nautomobilist, as he is thus enabled to travel, it is asserted, more than\r\nthree times farther than ever before on a single charge of the battery.\r\n\r\nEdison believes that there are important advantages possible in the\r\nemployment of his storage battery for street-car propulsion. Under the\r\npresent system of operation, a plant furnishing the electric power for\r\nstreet railways must be large enough to supply current for the maximum\r\nload during \"rush hours,\" although much of the machinery may be lying\r\nidle and unproductive in the hours of minimum load. By the use of\r\nstorage-battery cars, this immense and uneconomical maximum investment\r\nin plant can be cut down to proportions of true commercial economy, as\r\nthe charging of the batteries can be conducted at a uniform rate with a\r\nreasonable expenditure for generating machinery. Not only this, but each\r\ncar becomes an independently moving unit, not subject to delay by reason\r\nof a general breakdown of the power plant or of the line. In addition\r\nto these advantages, the streets would be freed from their burden of\r\ntrolley wires or conduits. To put his ideas into practice, Edison built\r\na short railway line at the Orange works in the winter of 1909-10, and,\r\nin co-operation with Mr. R. H. Beach, constructed a special type of\r\nstreet-car, and equipped it with motor, storage battery, and other\r\nnecessary operating devices. This car was subsequently put upon the\r\nstreet-car lines in New York City, and demonstrated its efficiency so\r\ncompletely that it was purchased by one of the street-car companies,\r\nwhich has since ordered additional cars for its lines. The demonstration\r\nof this initial car has been watched with interest by many railroad\r\nofficials, and its performance has been of so successful a nature that\r\nat the present writing (the summer of 1910) it has been necessary to\r\norganize and equip a preliminary factory in which to construct\r\nmany other cars of a similar type that have been ordered by other\r\nstreet-railway companies. This enterprise will be conducted by a\r\ncorporation which has been specially organized for the purpose. Thus,\r\nthere has been initiated the development of a new and important industry\r\nwhose possible ultimate proportions are beyond the range of present\r\ncalculation. Extensive as this industry may become, however, Edison is\r\nfirmly convinced that the greatest field for his storage battery lies\r\nin its adaptation to commercial trucking and hauling, and to pleasure\r\nvehicles, in comparison with which the street-car business even with its\r\ngreat possibilities--will not amount to more than 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nEdison has pithily summed up his work and his views in an article on\r\n\"The To-Morrows of Electricity and Invention\" in Popular Electricity\r\nfor June, 1910, in which he says: \"For years past I have been trying to\r\nperfect a storage battery, and have now rendered it entirely suitable\r\nto automobile and other work. There is absolutely no reason why horses\r\nshould be allowed within city limits; for between the gasoline and the\r\nelectric car, no room is left for them. They are not needed. The cow\r\nand the pig have gone, and the horse is still more undesirable. A higher\r\npublic ideal of health and cleanliness is working toward such banishment\r\nvery swiftly; and then we shall have decent streets, instead of stables\r\nmade out of strips of cobblestones bordered by sidewalks. The worst\r\nuse of money is to make a fine thoroughfare, and then turn it over to\r\nhorses. Besides that, the change will put the humane societies out of\r\nbusiness. Many people now charge their own batteries because of lack of\r\nfacilities; but I believe central stations will find in this work very\r\nsoon the largest part of their load. The New York Edison Company, or\r\nthe Chicago Edison Company, should have as much current going out for\r\nstorage batteries as for power motors; and it will be so some near day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS\r\n\r\nIT has been the endeavor in this narrative to group Edison's inventions\r\nand patents so that his work in the different fields can be studied\r\nindependently and separately. The history of his career has therefore\r\nfallen naturally into a series of chapters, each aiming to describe some\r\nparticular development or art; and, in a way, the plan has been helpful\r\nto the writers while probably useful to the readers. It happens,\r\nhowever, that the process has left a vast mass of discovery and\r\ninvention wholly untouched, and relegates to a concluding brief chapter\r\nsome of the most interesting episodes of a fruitful life. Any one who\r\nwill turn to the list of Edison patents at the end of the book will find\r\na large number of things of which not even casual mention has been made,\r\nbut which at the time occupied no small amount of the inventor's time\r\nand attention, and many of which are now part and parcel of modern\r\ncivilization. Edison has, indeed, touched nothing that he did not in\r\nsome way improve. As Thoreau said: \"The laws of the Universe are not\r\nindifferent, but are forever on the side of the most sensitive,\" and\r\nthere never was any one more sensitive to the defects of every art and\r\nappliance, nor any one more active in applying the law of evolution.\r\nIt is perhaps this many-sidedness of Edison that has impressed the\r\nmultitude, and that in the \"popular vote\" taken a couple of years ago\r\nby the New York Herald placed his name at the head of the list of ten\r\ngreatest living Americans. It is curious and pertinent to note that a\r\nsimilar plebiscite taken by a technical journal among its expert readers\r\nhad exactly the same result. Evidently the public does not agree with\r\nthe opinion expressed by the eccentric artist Blake in his \"Marriage of\r\nHeaven and Hell,\" when he said: \"Improvement makes strange roads; but\r\nthe crooked roads without improvements are roads of Genius.\"\r\n\r\nThe product of Edison's brain may be divided into three classes. The\r\nfirst embraces such arts and industries, or such apparatus, as have\r\nalready been treated. The second includes devices like the tasimeter,\r\nphonomotor, odoroscope, etc., and others now to be noted. The third\r\nembraces a number of projected inventions, partially completed\r\ninvestigations, inventions in use but not patented, and a great many\r\ncaveats filed in the Patent Office at various times during the last\r\nforty years for the purpose of protecting his ideas pending their\r\ncontemplated realization in practice. These caveats served their purpose\r\nthoroughly in many instances, but there have remained a great variety of\r\nprojects upon which no definite action was ever taken. One ought to\r\nadd the contents of an unfinished piece of extraordinary fiction based\r\nwholly on new inventions and devices utterly unknown to mankind. Some\r\nday the novel may be finished, but Edison has no inclination to go\r\nback to it, and says he cannot understand how any man is able to make a\r\nspeech or write a book, for he simply can't do it.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said in previous chapters, it will not seem so\r\nstrange that Edison should have hundreds of dormant inventions on his\r\nhands. There are human limitations even for such a tireless worker as he\r\nis. While the preparation of data for this chapter was going on, one of\r\nthe writers in discussing with him the vast array of unexploited things\r\nsaid: \"Don't you feel a sense of regret in being obliged to leave so\r\nmany things uncompleted?\" To which he replied: \"What's the use? One\r\nlifetime is too short, and I am busy every day improving essential parts\r\nof my established industries.\" It must suffice to speak briefly of a few\r\nleading inventions that have been worked out, and to dismiss with\r\nscant mention all the rest, taking just a few items, as typical and\r\nsuggestive, especially when Edison can himself be quoted as to them.\r\nIncidentally it may be noted that things, not words, are referred to;\r\nfor Edison, in addition to inventing the apparatus, has often had to\r\ncoin the word to describe it. A large number of the words and phrases in\r\nmodern electrical parlance owe their origin to him. Even the \"call-word\"\r\nof the telephone, \"Hello!\" sent tingling over the wire a few million\r\ntimes daily was taken from Menlo Park by men installing telephones\r\nin different parts of the world, men who had just learned it at\r\nthe laboratory, and thus made it a universal sesame for telephonic\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to determine where to begin with Edison's miscellaneous\r\ninventions, but perhaps telegraphy has the \"right of line,\" and Edison's\r\nwork in that field puts him abreast of the latest wireless developments\r\nthat fill the world with wonder. \"I perfected a system of train\r\ntelegraphy between stations and trains in motion whereby messages could\r\nbe sent from the moving train to the central office; and this was the\r\nforerunner of wireless telegraphy. This system was used for a number of\r\nyears on the Lehigh Valley Railroad on their construction trains. The\r\nelectric wave passed from a piece of metal on top of the car across\r\nthe air to the telegraph wires; and then proceeded to the despatcher's\r\noffice. In my first experiments with this system I tried it on the\r\nStaten Island Railroad, and employed an operator named King to do the\r\nexperimenting. He reported results every day, and received instructions\r\nby mail; but for some reason he could send messages all right when the\r\ntrain went in one direction, but could not make it go in the contrary\r\ndirection. I made suggestions of every kind to get around this\r\nphenomenon. Finally I telegraphed King to find out if he had any\r\nsuggestions himself; and I received a reply that the only way he could\r\npropose to get around the difficulty was to put the island on a pivot\r\nso it could be turned around! I found the trouble finally, and the\r\npractical introduction on the Lehigh Valley road was the result. The\r\nsystem was sold to a very wealthy man, and he would never sell any\r\nrights or answer letters. He became a spiritualist subsequently, which\r\nprobably explains it.\" It is interesting to note that Edison became\r\ngreatly interested in the later developments by Marconi, and is an\r\nadmiring friend and adviser of that well-known inventor.\r\n\r\nThe earlier experiments with wireless telegraphy at Menlo Park were\r\nmade at a time when Edison was greatly occupied with his electric-light\r\ninterests, and it was not until the beginning of 1886 that he was\r\nable to spare the time to make a public demonstration of the system\r\nas applied to moving trains. Ezra T. Gilliland, of Boston, had become\r\nassociated with him in his experiments, and they took out several joint\r\npatents subsequently. The first practical use of the system took place\r\non a thirteen-mile stretch of the Staten Island Railroad with the\r\nresults mentioned by Edison above.\r\n\r\nA little later, Edison and Gilliland joined forces with Lucius J.\r\nPhelps, another investigator, who had been experimenting along the same\r\nlines and had taken out several patents. The various interests were\r\ncombined in a corporation under whose auspices the system was installed\r\non the Lehigh Valley Railroad, where it was used for several years. The\r\nofficial demonstration trip on this road took place on October 6,\r\n1887, on a six-car train running to Easton, Pennsylvania, a distance of\r\nfifty-four miles. A great many telegrams were sent and received while\r\nthe train was at full speed, including a despatch to the \"cable king,\"\r\nJohn Pender. London, England, and a reply from him. [17]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 17: Broadly described in outline, the system\r\n     consisted of an induction circuit obtained by laying strips\r\n     of tin along the top or roof of a railway car, and the\r\n     installation of a special telegraph line running parallel\r\n     with the track and strung on poles of only medium height.\r\n     The train and also each signalling station were equipped\r\n     with regulation telegraphic apparatus, such as battery, key,\r\n     relay, and sounder, together with induction-coil and\r\n     condenser. In addition, there was a transmitting device in\r\n     the shape of a musical reed, or buzzer. In practice, this\r\n     buzzer was continuously operated at high speed by a battery.\r\n     Its vibrations were broken by means of a key into long and\r\n     short periods, representing Morse characters, which were\r\n     transmitted inductively from the train circuit to the pole\r\n     line, or vice versa, and received by the operator at the\r\n     other end through a high-resistance telephone receiver\r\n     inserted in the secondary circuit of the induction-coil.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the space between the cars and the pole line was probably not\r\nmore than about fifty feet, it is interesting to note that in Edison's\r\nearly experiments at Menlo Park he succeeded in transmitting messages\r\nthrough the air at a distance of 580 feet. Speaking of this and of\r\nhis other experiments with induction telegraphy by means of kites,\r\ncommunicating from one to the other and thus from the kites to\r\ninstruments on the earth, Edison said recently: \"We only transmitted\r\nabout two and one-half miles through the kites. What has always puzzled\r\nme since is that I did not think of using the results of my experiments\r\non 'etheric force' that I made in 1875. I have never been able to\r\nunderstand how I came to overlook them. If I had made use of my own work\r\nI should have had long-distance wireless telegraphy.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of the appendices to this book is given a brief technical account\r\nof Edison's investigations of the phenomena which lie at the root of\r\nmodern wireless or \"space\" telegraphy, and the attention of the reader\r\nis directed particularly to the description and quotations there from\r\nthe famous note-books of Edison's experiments in regard to what he\r\ncalled \"etheric force.\" It will be seen that as early as 1875 Edison\r\ndetected and studied certain phenomena--i.e., the production of\r\nelectrical effects in non-closed circuits, which for a time made him\r\nthink he was on the trail of a new force, as there was no plausible\r\nexplanation for them by the then known laws of electricity and\r\nmagnetism. Later came the magnificent work of Hertz identifying the\r\nphenomena as \"electromagnetic waves\" in the ether, and developing a\r\nnew world of theory and science based upon them and their production by\r\ndisruptive discharges.\r\n\r\nEdison's assertions were treated with scepticism by the scientific\r\nworld, which was not then ready for the discovery and not sufficiently\r\nfurnished with corroborative data. It is singular, to say the least,\r\nto note how Edison's experiments paralleled and proved in advance those\r\nthat came later; and even his apparatus such as the \"dark box\" for\r\nmaking the tiny sparks visible (as the waves impinged on the receiver)\r\nbears close analogy with similar apparatus employed by Hertz. Indeed, as\r\nEdison sent the dark-box apparatus to the Paris Exposition in 1881,\r\nand let Batchelor repeat there the puzzling experiments, it seems by no\r\nmeans unlikely that, either directly or on the report of some friend,\r\nHertz may thus have received from Edison a most valuable suggestion, the\r\ninventor aiding the physicist in opening up a wonderful new realm.\r\nIn this connection, indeed, it is very interesting to quote two great\r\nauthorities. In May, 1889, at a meeting of the Institution of Electrical\r\nEngineers in London, Dr. (now Sir) Oliver Lodge remarked in a discussion\r\non a paper of his own on lightning conductors, embracing the Hertzian\r\nwaves in its treatment: \"Many of the effects I have shown--sparks in\r\nunsuspected places and other things--have been observed before. Henry\r\nobserved things of the kind and Edison noticed some curious phenomena,\r\nand said it was not electricity but 'etheric force' that caused these\r\nsparks; and the matter was rather pooh-poohed. It was a small part of\r\nTHIS VERY THING; only the time was not ripe; theoretical knowledge was\r\nnot ready for it.\" Again in his \"Signalling without Wires,\" in giving\r\nthe history of the coherer principle, Lodge remarks: \"Sparks identical\r\nin all respects with those discovered by Hertz had been seen in recent\r\ntimes both by Edison and by Sylvanus Thompson, being styled 'etheric\r\nforce' by the former; but their theoretic significance had not been\r\nperceived, and they were somewhat sceptically regarded.\" During the same\r\ndiscussion in London, in 1889, Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), after\r\nciting some experiments by Faraday with his insulated cage at the Royal\r\nInstitution, said: \"His (Faraday's) attention was not directed to look\r\nfor Hertz sparks, or probably he might have found them in the interior.\r\nEdison seems to have noticed something of the kind in what he called\r\n'etheric force.' His name 'etheric' may thirteen years ago have seemed\r\nto many people absurd. But now we are all beginning to call these\r\ninductive phenomena 'etheric.'\" With which testimony from the great\r\nKelvin as to his priority in determining the vital fact, and with the\r\nevidence that as early as 1875 he built apparatus that demonstrated the\r\nfact, Edison is probably quite content.\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps be noted at this point that a curious effect observed\r\nat the laboratory was shown in connection with Edison lamps at the\r\nPhiladelphia Exhibition of 1884. It became known in scientific parlance\r\nas the \"Edison effect,\" showing a curious current condition or discharge\r\nin the vacuum of the bulb. It has since been employed by Fleming in\r\nEngland and De Forest in this country, and others, as the basis for\r\nwireless-telegraph apparatus. It is in reality a minute rectifier of\r\nalternating current, and analogous to those which have since been made\r\non a large scale.\r\n\r\nWhen Roentgen came forward with his discovery of the new \"X\"-ray in\r\n1895, Edison was ready for it, and took up experimentation with it on\r\na large scale; some of his work being recorded in an article in the\r\nCentury Magazine of May, 1896, where a great deal of data may be found.\r\nEdison says with regard to this work: \"When the X-ray came up, I made\r\nthe first fluoroscope, using tungstate of calcium. I also found that\r\nthis tungstate could be put into a vacuum chamber of glass and fused\r\nto the inner walls of the chamber; and if the X-ray electrodes were let\r\ninto the glass chamber and a proper vacuum was attained, you could get a\r\nfluorescent lamp of several candle-power. I started in to make a number\r\nof these lamps, but I soon found that the X-ray had affected poisonously\r\nmy assistant, Mr. Dally, so that his hair came out and his flesh\r\ncommenced to ulcerate. I then concluded it would not do, and that it\r\nwould not be a very popular kind of light; so I dropped it.\r\n\r\n\"At the time I selected tungstate of calcium because it was\r\nso fluorescent, I set four men to making all kinds of chemical\r\ncombinations, and thus collected upward of 8000 different crystals of\r\nvarious chemical combinations, discovering several hundred different\r\nsubstances which would fluoresce to the X-ray. So far little had come\r\nof X-ray work, but it added another letter to the scientific alphabet.\r\nI don't know any thing about radium, and I have lots of company.\" The\r\nElectrical Engineer of June 3, 1896, contains a photograph of Mr. Edison\r\ntaken by the light of one of his fluorescent lamps. The same journal\r\nin its issue of April 1, 1896, shows an Edison fluoroscope in use by\r\nan observer, in the now familiar and universal form somewhat like a\r\nstereoscope. This apparatus as invented by Edison consists of a flaring\r\nbox, curved at one end to fit closely over the forehead and eyes, while\r\nthe other end of the box is closed by a paste-board cover. On the inside\r\nof this is spread a layer of tungstate of calcium. By placing the\r\nobject to be observed, such as the hand, between the vacuum-tube and\r\nthe fluorescent screen, the \"shadow\" is formed on the screen and can be\r\nobserved at leisure. The apparatus has proved invaluable in surgery and\r\nhas become an accepted part of the equipment of modern surgery. In 1896,\r\nat the Electrical Exhibition in the Grand Central Palace, New York City,\r\ngiven under the auspices of the National Electric Light Association,\r\nthousands and thousands of persons with the use of this apparatus in\r\nEdison's personal exhibit were enabled to see their own bones; and the\r\nresultant public sensation was great. Mr. Mallory tells a characteristic\r\nstory of Edison's own share in the memorable exhibit: \"The exhibit\r\nwas announced for opening on Monday. On the preceding Friday all the\r\napparatus, which included a large induction-coil, was shipped from\r\nOrange to New York, and on Saturday afternoon Edison, accompanied by\r\nFred Ott, one of his assistants, and myself, went over to install it so\r\nas to have it ready for Monday morning. Had everything been normal, a\r\nfew hours would have sufficed for completion of the work, but on coming\r\nto test the big coil, it was found to be absolutely out of commission,\r\nhaving been so seriously injured as to necessitate its entire rewinding.\r\nIt being summer-time, all the machine shops were closed until Monday\r\nmorning, and there were several miles of wire to be wound on the coil.\r\nEdison would not consider a postponement of the exhibition, so there was\r\nnothing to do but go to work and wind it by hand. We managed to find\r\na lathe, but there was no power; so each of us, including Edison, took\r\nturns revolving the lathe by pulling on the belt, while the other two\r\nattended to the winding of the wire. We worked continuously all through\r\nthat Saturday night and all day Sunday until evening, when we finished\r\nthe job. I don't remember ever being conscious of more muscles in\r\nmy life. I guess Edison was tired also, but he took it very\r\nphilosophically.\" This was apparently the first public demonstration of\r\nthe X-ray to the American public.\r\n\r\nEdison's ore-separation work has been already fully described, but the\r\nstory would hardly be complete without a reference to similar work\r\nin gold extraction, dating back to the Menlo Park days: \"I got up a\r\nmethod,\" says Edison, \"of separating placer gold by a dry process, in\r\nwhich I could work economically ore as lean as five cents of gold to the\r\ncubic yard. I had several car-loads of different placer sands sent to me\r\nand proved I could do it. Some parties hearing I had succeeded in doing\r\nsuch a thing went to work and got hold of what was known as the Ortiz\r\nmine grant, twelve miles from Santa Fe, New Mexico. This mine, according\r\nto the reports of several mining engineers made in the last forty years,\r\nwas considered one of the richest placer deposits in the United States,\r\nand various schemes had been put forward to bring water from the\r\nmountains forty miles away to work those immense beds. The reports\r\nstated that the Mexicans had been panning gold for a hundred years out\r\nof these deposits.\r\n\r\n\"These parties now made arrangements with the stockholders or owners of\r\nthe grant, and with me, to work the deposits by my process. As I had had\r\nsome previous experience with the statements of mining men, I concluded\r\nI would just send down a small plant and prospect the field before\r\nputting up a large one. This I did, and I sent two of my assistants,\r\nwhom I could trust, down to this place to erect the plant; and started\r\nto sink shafts fifty feet deep all over the area. We soon learned that\r\nthe rich gravel, instead of being spread over an area of three by seven\r\nmiles, and rich from the grass roots down, was spread over a space of\r\nabout twenty-five acres, and that even this did not average more than\r\nten cents to the cubic yard. The whole placer would not give more than\r\none and one-quarter cents per cubic yard. As my business arrangements\r\nhad not been very perfectly made, I lost the usual amount.\"\r\n\r\nGoing to another extreme, we find Edison grappling with one of the\r\nbiggest problems known to the authorities of New York--the disposal of\r\nits heavy snows. It is needless to say that witnessing the ordinary slow\r\nand costly procedure would put Edison on his mettle. \"One time when\r\nthey had a snow blockade in New York I started to build a machine with\r\nBatchelor--a big truck with a steam-engine and compressor on it. We\r\nwould run along the street, gather all the snow up in front of us, pass\r\nit into the compressor, and deliver little blocks of ice behind us\r\nin the gutter, taking one-tenth the room of the snow, and not\r\ninconveniencing anybody. We could thus take care of a snow-storm\r\nby diminishing the bulk of material to be handled. The preliminary\r\nexperiment we made was dropped because we went into other things. The\r\nmachine would go as fast as a horse could walk.\"\r\n\r\nEdison has always taken a keen interest in aerial flight, and has also\r\nexperimented with aeroplanes, his preference inclining to the helicopter\r\ntype, as noted in the newspapers and periodicals from time to time.\r\nThe following statement from him refers to a type of aeroplane of great\r\nnovelty and ingenuity: \"James Gordon Bennett came to me and asked that\r\nI try some primary experiments to see if aerial navigation was feasible\r\nwith 'heavier-than-air' machines. I got up a motor and put it on the\r\nscales and tried a large number of different things and contrivances\r\nconnected to the motor, to see how it would lighten itself on the\r\nscales. I got some data and made up my mind that what was needed was a\r\nvery powerful engine for its weight, in small compass. So I conceived of\r\nan engine employing guncotton. I took a lot of ticker paper tape, turned\r\nit into guncotton and got up an engine with an arrangement whereby I\r\ncould feed this gun-cotton strip into the cylinder and explode it inside\r\nelectrically. The feed took place between two copper rolls. The copper\r\nkept the temperature down, so that it could only explode up to the point\r\nwhere it was in contact with the feed rolls. It worked pretty well;\r\nbut once the feed roll didn't save it, and the flame went through and\r\nexploded the whole roll and kicked up such a bad explosion I abandoned\r\nit. But the idea might be made to work.\"\r\n\r\nTurning from the air to the earth, it is interesting to note that the\r\nintroduction of the underground Edison system in New York made an appeal\r\nto inventive ingenuity and that one of the difficulties was met as\r\nfollows: \"When we first put the Pearl Street station in operation, in\r\nNew York, we had cast-iron junction-boxes at the intersections of all\r\nthe streets. One night, or about two o'clock in the morning, a policeman\r\ncame in and said that something had exploded at the corner of William\r\nand Nassau streets. I happened to be in the station, and went out to see\r\nwhat it was. I found that the cover of the manhole, weighing about 200\r\npounds, had entirely disappeared, but everything inside was intact. It\r\nhad even stripped some of the threads of the bolts, and we could never\r\nfind that cover. I concluded it was either leakage of gas into the\r\nmanhole, or else the acid used in pickling the casting had given off\r\nhydrogen, and air had leaked in, making an explosive mixture. As this\r\nwas a pretty serious problem, and as we had a good many of the manholes,\r\nit worried me very much for fear that it would be repeated and the\r\ncompany might have to pay a lot of damages, especially in districts\r\nlike that around William and Nassau, where there are a good many people\r\nabout. If an explosion took place in the daytime it might lift a few of\r\nthem up. However, I got around the difficulty by putting a little bottle\r\nof chloroform in each box, corked up, with a slight hole in the cork.\r\nThe chloroform being volatile and very heavy, settled in the box and\r\ndisplaced all the air. I have never heard of an explosion in a manhole\r\nwhere this chloroform had been used. Carbon tetrachloride, now made\r\nelectrically at Niagara Falls, is very cheap and would be ideal for the\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nEdison has never paid much attention to warfare, and has in general\r\ndisdained to develop inventions for the destruction of life and\r\nproperty. Some years ago, however, he became the joint inventor of\r\nthe Edison-Sims torpedo, with Mr. W. Scott Sims, who sought his\r\nco-operation. This is a dirigible submarine torpedo operated by\r\nelectricity. In the torpedo proper, which is suspended from a long\r\nfloat so as to be submerged a few feet under water, are placed the small\r\nelectric motor for propulsion and steering, and the explosive charge.\r\nThe torpedo is controlled from the shore or ship through an electric\r\ncable which it pays out as it goes along, and all operations of varying\r\nthe speed, reversing, and steering are performed at the will of the\r\ndistant operator by means of currents sent through the cable. During the\r\nSpanish-American War of 1898 Edison suggested to the Navy Department the\r\nadoption of a compound of calcium carbide and calcium phosphite, which\r\nwhen placed in a shell and fired from a gun would explode as soon as it\r\nstruck water and ignite, producing a blaze that would continue several\r\nminutes and make the ships of the enemy visible for four or five miles\r\nat sea. Moreover, the blaze could not be extinguished.\r\n\r\nEdison has always been deeply interested in \"conservation,\" and much\r\nof his work has been directed toward the economy of fuel in obtaining\r\nelectrical energy directly from the consumption of coal. Indeed, it\r\nwill be noted that the example of his handwriting shown in these volumes\r\ndeals with the importance of obtaining available energy direct from the\r\ncombustible without the enormous loss in the intervening stages that\r\nmakes our best modern methods of steam generation and utilization so\r\nbarbarously extravagant and wasteful. Several years ago, experimenting\r\nin this field, Edison devised and operated some ingenious pyromagnetic\r\nmotors and generators, based, as the name implies, on the direct\r\napplication of heat to the machines. The motor is founded upon the\r\nprinciple discovered by the famous Dr. William Gilbert--court physician\r\nto Queen Elizabeth, and the Father of modern electricity--that the\r\nmagnetic properties of iron diminish with heat. At a light-red heat,\r\niron becomes non-magnetic, so that a strong magnet exerts no influence\r\nover it. Edison employed this peculiar property by constructing a small\r\nmachine in which a pivoted bar is alternately heated and cooled. It\r\nis thus attracted toward an adjacent electromagnet when cold and is\r\nuninfluenced when hot, and as the result motion is produced.\r\n\r\nThe pyromagnetic generator is based on the same phenomenon; its aim\r\nbeing of course to generate electrical energy directly from the heat of\r\nthe combustible. The armature, or moving part of the machine, consists\r\nin reality of eight separate armatures all constructed of corrugated\r\nsheet iron covered with asbestos and wound with wire. These armatures\r\nare held in place by two circular iron plates, through the centre of\r\nwhich runs a shaft, carrying at its lower extremity a semicircular\r\nshield of fire-clay, which covers the ends of four of the armatures.\r\nThe heat, of whatever origin, is applied from below, and the shaft being\r\nrevolved, four of the armatures lose their magnetism constantly, while\r\nthe other four gain it, so to speak. As the moving part revolves,\r\ntherefore, currents of electricity are set up in the wires of the\r\narmatures and are collected by a commutator, as in an ordinary dynamo,\r\nplaced on the upper end of the central shaft.\r\n\r\nA great variety of electrical instruments are included in Edison's\r\ninventions, many of these in fundamental or earlier forms being devised\r\nfor his systems of light and power, as noted already. There are numerous\r\nothers, and it might be said with truth that Edison is hardly ever\r\nwithout some new device of this kind in hand, as he is by no means\r\nsatisfied with the present status of electrical measurements. He holds\r\nin general that the meters of to-day, whether for heavy or for feeble\r\ncurrents, are too expensive, and that cheaper instruments are a\r\nnecessity of the times. These remarks apply more particularly to what\r\nmay be termed, in general, circuit meters. In other classes Edison\r\nhas devised an excellent form of magnetic bridge, being an ingenious\r\napplication of the principles of the familiar Wheatstone bridge, used\r\nso extensively for measuring the electrical resistance of wires; the\r\ntesting of iron for magnetic qualities being determined by it in the\r\nsame way. Another special instrument is a \"dead beat\" galvanometer which\r\ndiffers from the ordinary form of galvanometer in having no coils or\r\nmagnetic needle. It depends for its action upon the heating effect of\r\nthe current, which causes a fine platinum-iridium wire enclosed in a\r\nglass tube to expand; thus allowing a coiled spring to act on a pivoted\r\nshaft carrying a tiny mirror. The mirror as it moves throws a beam of\r\nlight upon a scale and the indications are read by the spot of\r\nlight. Most novel of all the apparatus of this measuring kind is the\r\nodoroscope, which is like the tasimeter described in an earlier chapter,\r\nexcept that a strip of gelatine takes the place of hard rubber, as\r\nthe sensitive member. Besides being affected by heat, this device is\r\nexceedingly sensitive to moisture. A few drops of water or perfume\r\nthrown on the floor of a room are sufficient to give a very decided\r\nindication on the galvanometer in circuit with the instrument.\r\nBarometers, hygrometers, and similar instruments of great delicacy can\r\nbe constructed on the principle of the odoroscope; and it may also be\r\nused in determining the character or pressure of gases and vapors in\r\nwhich it has been placed.\r\n\r\nIn the list of Edison's patents at the end of this work may be noted\r\nmany other of his miscellaneous inventions, covering items such as\r\npreserving fruit in vacuo, making plate-glass, drawing wire, and\r\nmetallurgical processes for treatment of nickel, gold, and copper ores;\r\nbut to mention these inventions separately would trespass too much on\r\nour limited space here. Hence, we shall leave the interested reader to\r\nexamine that list for himself.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last Edison has filed in the United States Patent\r\nOffice--in addition to more than 1400 applications for patents--some\r\n120 caveats embracing not less than 1500 inventions. A \"caveat\" is\r\nessentially a notice filed by an inventor, entitling him to receive\r\nwarning from the Office of any application for a patent for an invention\r\nthat would \"interfere\" with his own, during the year, while he is\r\nsupposed to be perfecting his device. The old caveat system has now been\r\nabolished, but it served to elicit from Edison a most astounding record\r\nof ideas and possible inventions upon which he was working, and many\r\nof which he of course reduced to practice. As an example of Edison's\r\nfertility and the endless variety of subjects engaging his thoughts, the\r\nfollowing list of matters covered by ONE caveat is given. It is needless\r\nto say that all the caveats are not quite so full of \"plums,\" but this\r\nis certainly a wonder.\r\n\r\nForty-one distinct inventions relating to the phonograph, covering\r\nvarious forms of recorders, arrangement of parts, making of records,\r\nshaving tool, adjustments, etc.\r\n\r\nEight forms of electric lamps using infusible earthy oxides and brought\r\nto high incandescence in vacuo by high potential current of several\r\nthousand volts; same character as impingement of X-rays on object in\r\nbulb.\r\n\r\nA loud-speaking telephone with quartz cylinder and beam of ultra-violet\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nFour forms of arc light with special carbons.\r\n\r\nA thermostatic motor.\r\n\r\nA device for sealing together the inside part and bulb of an\r\nincandescent lamp mechanically.\r\n\r\nRegulators for dynamos and motors.\r\n\r\nThree devices for utilizing vibrations beyond the ultra violet.\r\n\r\nA great variety of methods for coating incandescent lamp filaments with\r\nsilicon, titanium, chromium, osmium, boron, etc.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods of making porous filaments.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods of making squirted filaments of a variety of materials,\r\nof which about thirty are specified.\r\n\r\nSeventeen different methods and devices for separating magnetic ores.\r\n\r\nA continuously operative primary battery.\r\n\r\nA musical instrument operating one of Helmholtz's artificial larynxes.\r\n\r\nA siren worked by explosion of small quantities of oxygen and hydrogen\r\nmixed.\r\n\r\nThree other sirens made to give vocal sounds or articulate speech.\r\n\r\nA device for projecting sound-waves to a distance without spreading and\r\nin a straight line, on the principle of smoke rings.\r\n\r\nA device for continuously indicating on a galvanometer the depths of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nA method of preventing in a great measure friction of water against the\r\nhull of a ship and incidentally preventing fouling by barnacles.\r\n\r\nA telephone receiver whereby the vibrations of the diaphragm are\r\nconsiderably amplified.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of \"space\" telegraphy at sea.\r\n\r\nAn improved and extended string telephone.\r\n\r\nDevices and method of talking through water for considerable distances.\r\n\r\nAn audiphone for deaf people.\r\n\r\nSound-bridge for measuring resistance of tubes and other materials for\r\nconveying sound.\r\n\r\nA method of testing a magnet to ascertain the existence of flaws in the\r\niron or steel composing the same.\r\n\r\nMethod of distilling liquids by incandescent conductor immersed in the\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nMethod of obtaining electricity direct from coal.\r\n\r\nAn engine operated by steam produced by the hydration and dehydration of\r\nmetallic salts.\r\n\r\nDevice and method for telegraphing photographically.\r\n\r\nCarbon crucible kept brilliantly incandescent by current in vacuo, for\r\nobtaining reaction with refractory metals.\r\n\r\nDevice for examining combinations of odors and their changes by rotation\r\nat different speeds.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the preceding items it will be noted that even in the\r\neighties Edison perceived much advantage to be gained in the line of\r\neconomy by the use of lamp filaments employing refractory metals in\r\ntheir construction. From another caveat, filed in 1889, we extract the\r\nfollowing, which shows that he realized the value of tungsten also for\r\nthis purpose. \"Filaments of carbon placed in a combustion tube with a\r\nlittle chloride ammonium. Chloride tungsten or titanium passed through\r\nhot tube, depositing a film of metal on the carbon; or filaments of\r\nzirconia oxide, or alumina or magnesia, thoria or other infusible oxides\r\nmixed or separate, and obtained by moistening and squirting through a\r\ndie, are thus coated with above metals and used for incandescent lamps.\r\nOsmium from a volatile compound of same thus deposited makes a filament\r\nas good as carbon when in vacuo.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1888, long before there arose the actual necessity of duplicating\r\nphonograph records so as to produce replicas in great numbers, Edison\r\ndescribed in one of his caveats a method and process much similar to\r\nthe one which was put into practice by him in later years. In the\r\nsame caveat he describes an invention whereby the power to indent on\r\na phonograph cylinder, instead of coming directly from the voice, is\r\ncaused by power derived from the rotation or movement of the phonogram\r\nsurface itself. He did not, however, follow up this invention and put it\r\ninto practice. Some twenty years later it was independently invented\r\nand patented by another inventor. A further instance of this kind is\r\na method of telegraphy at sea by means of a diaphragm in a closed\r\nport-hole flush with the side of the vessel, and actuated by a\r\nsteam-whistle which is controlled by a lever, similarly to a Morse key.\r\nA receiving diaphragm is placed in another and near-by chamber, which is\r\nprovided with very sensitive stethoscopic ear-pieces, by which the\r\nMorse characters sent from another vessel may be received. This was\r\nalso invented later by another inventor, and is in use to-day, but will\r\nnaturally be rivalled by wireless telegraphy. Still another instance\r\nis seen in one of Edison's caveats, where he describes a method of\r\ndistilling liquids by means of internally applied heat through electric\r\nconductors. Although Edison did not follow up the idea and take out a\r\npatent, this system of distillation was later hit upon by others and is\r\nin use at the present time.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages of this chapter the authors have endeavored\r\nto present very briefly a sketchy notion of the astounding range of\r\nEdison's practical ideas, but they feel a sense of impotence in being\r\nunable to deal adequately with the subject in the space that can be\r\ndevoted to it. To those who, like the authors, have had the privilege\r\nof examining the voluminous records which show the flights of his\r\nimagination, there comes a feeling of utter inadequacy to convey to\r\nothers the full extent of the story they reveal.\r\n\r\nThe few specific instances above related, although not representing a\r\ntithe of Edison's work, will probably be sufficient to enable the reader\r\nto appreciate to some extent his great wealth of ideas and fertility\r\nof imagination, and also to realize that this imagination is not only\r\nintensely practical, but that it works prophetically along lines of\r\nnatural progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nEDISON'S METHOD IN INVENTING\r\n\r\nWHILE the world's progress depends largely upon their ingenuity,\r\ninventors are not usually persons who have adopted invention as a\r\ndistinct profession, but, generally speaking, are otherwise engaged in\r\nvarious walks of life. By reason of more or less inherent native genius\r\nthey either make improvements along lines of present occupation, or\r\nelse evolve new methods and means of accomplishing results in fields for\r\nwhich they may have personal predilections.\r\n\r\nNow and then, however, there arises a man so greatly endowed with\r\nnatural powers and originality that the creative faculty within him\r\nis too strong to endure the humdrum routine of affairs, and manifests\r\nitself in a life devoted entirely to the evolution of methods and\r\ndevices calculated to further the world's welfare. In other words, he\r\nbecomes an inventor by profession. Such a man is Edison. Notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that nearly forty years ago (not a great while after he had\r\nemerged from the ranks of peripatetic telegraph operators) he was\r\nthe owner of a large and profitable business as a manufacturer of the\r\ntelegraphic apparatus invented by him, the call of his nature was too\r\nstrong to allow of profits being laid away in the bank to accumulate. As\r\nhe himself has said, he has \"too sanguine a temperament to allow money\r\nto stay in solitary confinement.\" Hence, all superfluous cash was\r\ndevoted to experimentation. In the course of years he grew more and\r\nmore impatient of the shackles that bound him to business routine, and,\r\nrealizing the powers within him, he drew away gradually from purely\r\nmanufacturing occupations, determining deliberately to devote his\r\nlife to inventive work, and to depend upon its results as a means of\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nAll persons who make inventions will necessarily be more or less\r\noriginal in character, but to the man who chooses to become an inventor\r\nby profession must be conceded a mind more than ordinarily replete\r\nwith virility and originality. That these qualities in Edison are\r\nsuperabundant is well known to all who have worked with him, and,\r\nindeed, are apparent to every one from his multiplied achievements\r\nwithin the period of one generation.\r\n\r\nIf one were allowed only two words with which to describe Edison, it\r\nis doubtful whether a close examination of the entire dictionary would\r\ndisclose any others more suitable than \"experimenter--inventor.\" These\r\nwould express the overruling characteristics of his eventful career. It\r\nis as an \"inventor\" that he sets himself down in the membership list of\r\nthe American Institute of Electrical Engineers. To attempt the strict\r\nplacing of these words in relation to each other (except alphabetically)\r\nwould be equal to an endeavor to solve the old problem as to which came\r\nfirst, the egg or the chicken; for although all his inventions have been\r\nevolved through experiment, many of his notable experiments have\r\ncalled forth the exercise of highly inventive faculties in their very\r\ninception. Investigation and experiment have been a consuming passion,\r\nan impelling force from within, as it were, from his petticoat days when\r\nhe collected goose-eggs and tried to hatch them out by sitting over\r\nthem himself. One might be inclined to dismiss this trivial incident\r\nsmilingly, as a mere childish, thoughtless prank, had not subsequent\r\ndevelopment as a child, boy, and man revealed a born investigator with\r\noriginal reasoning powers that, disdaining crooks and bends, always\r\naimed at the centre, and, like the flight of the bee, were accurate and\r\ndirect.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that a man of this kind should\r\nexhibit a ceaseless, absorbing desire for knowledge, and an apparently\r\nuncontrollable tendency to experiment on every possible occasion,\r\neven though his last cent were spent in thus satisfying the insatiate\r\ncravings of an inquiring mind.\r\n\r\nDuring Edison's immature years, when he was flitting about from place to\r\nplace as a telegraph operator, his experimentation was of a desultory,\r\nhand-to-mouth character, although it was always notable for originality,\r\nas expressed in a number of minor useful devices produced during this\r\nperiod. Small wonder, then, that at the end of these wanderings, when\r\nhe had found a place to \"rest the sole of his foot,\" he established a\r\nlaboratory in which to carry on his researches in a more methodical and\r\npractical manner. In this was the beginning of the work which has since\r\nmade such a profound impression on contemporary life.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of the helter-skelter, slap-dash style in Edison's\r\nexperiments. Although all the laboratory experimenters agree in the\r\nopinion that he \"tries everything,\" it is not merely the mixing of a\r\nlittle of this, some of that, and a few drops of the other, in the HOPE\r\nthat SOMETHING will come of it. Nor is the spirit of the laboratory\r\nwork represented in the following dialogue overheard between two alleged\r\ncarpenters picked up at random to help on a hurry job.\r\n\r\n\"How near does she fit, Mike?\"\r\n\r\n\"About an inch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nail her!\"\r\n\r\nA most casual examination of any of the laboratory records will reveal\r\nevidence of the minutest exactitude insisted on in the conduct of\r\nexperiments, irrespective of the length of time they occupied. Edison's\r\ninstructions, always clear cut and direct, followed by his keen\r\noversight, admit of nothing less than implicit observance in all\r\ndetails, no matter where they may lead, and impel to the utmost\r\nminuteness and accuracy.\r\n\r\nTo some extent there has been a popular notion that many of Edison's\r\nsuccesses have been due to mere dumb fool luck--to blind, fortuitous\r\n\"happenings.\" Nothing could be further from the truth, for, on the\r\ncontrary, it is owing almost entirely to the comprehensive scope of his\r\nknowledge, the breadth of his conception, the daring originality of\r\nhis methods, and minuteness and extent of experiment, combined with\r\nunwavering pertinacity, that new arts have been created and additions\r\nmade to others already in existence. Indeed, without this tireless\r\nminutiae, and methodical, searching spirit, it would have been\r\npractically impossible to have produced many of the most important of\r\nthese inventions.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, mastery of its literature is regarded by him as a\r\nmost important preliminary in taking up any line of investigation. What\r\nothers may have done, bearing directly or collaterally on the subject,\r\nin print, is carefully considered and sifted to the point of exhaustion.\r\nNot that he takes it for granted that the conclusions are correct, for\r\nhe frequently obtains vastly different results by repeating in his own\r\nway experiments made by others as detailed in books.\r\n\r\n\"Edison can travel along a well-used road and still find virgin soil,\"\r\nremarked recently one of his most practical experimenters, who had been\r\nworking along a certain line without attaining the desired result. \"He\r\nwanted to get a particular compound having definite qualities, and I had\r\ntried in all sorts of ways to produce it but with only partial success.\r\nHe was confident that it could be done, and said he would try it\r\nhimself. In doing so he followed the same path in which I had travelled,\r\nbut, by making an undreamed-of change in one of the operations,\r\nsucceeded in producing a compound that virtually came up to his\r\nspecifications. It is not the only time I have known this sort of thing\r\nto happen.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Edison's method of experimenting, another of his\r\nlaboratory staff says: \"He is never hindered by theory, but resorts to\r\nactual experiment for proof. For instance, when he conceived the idea of\r\npouring a complete concrete house it was universally held that it would\r\nbe impossible because the pieces of stone in the mixture would not rise\r\nto the level of the pouring-point, but would gravitate to a lower plane\r\nin the soft cement. This, however, did not hinder him from making\r\na series of experiments which resulted in an invention that proved\r\nconclusively the contrary.\"\r\n\r\nHaving conceived some new idea and read everything obtainable\r\nrelating to the subject in general, Edison's fertility of resource and\r\noriginality come into play. Taking one of the laboratory note-books,\r\nhe will write in it a memorandum of the experiments to be tried,\r\nillustrated, if necessary, by sketches. This book is then passed on\r\nto that member of the experimental staff whose special training and\r\nexperience are best adapted to the work. Here strenuousness is expected;\r\nand an immediate commencement of investigation and prompt report are\r\nrequired. Sometimes the subject may be such as to call for a long line\r\nof frequent tests which necessitate patient and accurate attention to\r\nminute details. Results must be reported often--daily, or possibly with\r\nstill greater frequency. Edison does not forget what is going on; but in\r\nhis daily tours through the laboratory keeps in touch with all the work\r\nthat is under the hands of his various assistants, showing by an instant\r\ngrasp of the present conditions of any experiment that he has a\r\nfull consciousness of its meaning and its reference to his original\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nThe year 1869 saw the beginning of Edison's career as an acknowledged\r\ninventor of commercial devices. From the outset, an innate recognition\r\nof system dictated the desirability and wisdom of preserving records\r\nof his experiments and inventions. The primitive records, covering the\r\nearliest years, were mainly jotted down on loose sheets of paper covered\r\nwith sketches, notes, and data, pasted into large scrap-books, or\r\npreserved in packages; but with the passing of years and enlargement of\r\nhis interests, it became the practice to make all original laboratory\r\nnotes in large, uniform books. This course was pursued until the Menlo\r\nPark period, when he instituted a new regime that has been continued\r\ndown to the present day. A standard form of note-book, about eight and\r\na half by six inches, containing about two hundred pages, was adopted.\r\nA number of these books were (and are now) always to be found scattered\r\naround in the different sections of the laboratory, and in them have\r\nbeen noted by Edison all his ideas, sketches, and memoranda. Details\r\nof the various experiments concerning them have been set down by his\r\nassistants from time to time.\r\n\r\nThese later laboratory note-books, of which there are now over one\r\nthousand in the series, are eloquent in the history they reveal of the\r\nstrenuous labors of Edison and his assistants and the vast fields\r\nof research he has covered during the last thirty years. They are\r\noverwhelmingly rich in biographic material, but analysis would be\r\na prohibitive task for one person, and perhaps interesting only to\r\ntechnical readers. Their pages cover practically every department\r\nof science. The countless thousands of separate experiments recorded\r\nexhibit the operations of a master mind seeking to surprise Nature into\r\na betrayal of her secrets by asking her the same question in a hundred\r\ndifferent ways. For instance, when Edison was investigating a certain\r\nproblem of importance many years ago, the note-books show that on this\r\npoint alone about fifteen thousand experiments and tests were made by\r\none of his assistants.\r\n\r\nA most casual glance over these note-books will illustrate the following\r\nremark, which was made to one of the writers not long ago by a member of\r\nthe laboratory staff who has been experimenting there for twenty years:\r\n\"Edison can think of more ways of doing a thing than any man I ever saw\r\nor heard of. He tries everything and never lets up, even though failure\r\nis apparently staring him in the face. He only stops when he simply\r\ncan't go any further on that particular line. When he decides on any\r\nmode of procedure he gives his notes to the experimenter and lets him\r\nalone, only stepping in from time to time to look at the operations and\r\nreceive reports of progress.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the development of the telephone transmitter, phonograph,\r\nincandescent lamp, dynamo, electrical distributing systems from central\r\nstations, electric railway, ore-milling, cement, motion pictures, and\r\na host of minor inventions may be found embedded in the laboratory\r\nnote-books. A passing glance at a few pages of these written records\r\nwill serve to illustrate, though only to a limited extent, the\r\nthoroughness of Edison's method. It is to be observed that these\r\nreferences can be but of the most meagre kind, and must be regarded as\r\nmerely throwing a side-light on the subject itself. For instance, the\r\ncomplex problem of a practical telephone transmitter gave rise to a\r\nseries of most exhaustive experiments. Combinations in almost infinite\r\nvariety, including gums, chemical compounds, oils, minerals, and metals\r\nwere suggested by Edison; and his assistants were given long lists\r\nof materials to try with reference to predetermined standards of\r\narticulation, degrees of loudness, and perfection of hissing sounds. The\r\nnote-books contain hundreds of pages showing that a great many thousands\r\nof experiments were tried and passed upon. Such remarks as \"N. G.\";\r\n\"Pretty good\"; \"Whistling good, but no articulation\"; \"Rattly\";\r\n\"Articulation, whispering, and whistling good\"; \"Best to-night so far\";\r\nand others are noted opposite the various combinations as they were\r\ntried. Thus, one may follow the investigation through a maze of\r\nexperiments which led up to the successful invention of the carbon\r\nbutton transmitter, the vital device to give the telephone its needed\r\narticulation and perfection.\r\n\r\nThe two hundred and odd note-books, covering the strenuous period during\r\nwhich Edison was carrying on his electric-light experiments, tell on\r\ntheir forty thousand pages or more a fascinating story of the evolution\r\nof a new art in its entirety. From the crude beginnings, through all\r\nthe varied phases of this evolution, the operations of a master mind\r\nare apparent from the contents of these pages, in which are recorded the\r\ninnumerable experiments, calculations, and tests that ultimately brought\r\nlight out of darkness.\r\n\r\nThe early work on a metallic conductor for lamps gave rise to some very\r\nthorough research on melting and alloying metals, the preparation of\r\nmetallic oxides, the coating of fine wires by immersing them in a great\r\nvariety of chemical solutions. Following his usual custom, Edison would\r\nindicate the lines of experiment to be followed, which were carried\r\nout and recorded in the note-books. He himself, in January, 1879, made\r\npersonally a most minute and searching investigation into the properties\r\nand behavior of plating-iridium, boron, rutile, zircon, chromium,\r\nmolybdenum, and nickel, under varying degrees of current strength, on\r\nwhich there may be found in the notes about forty pages of detailed\r\nexperiments and deductions in his own handwriting, concluding with the\r\nremark (about nickel): \"This is a great discovery for electric light in\r\nthe way of economy.\"\r\n\r\nThis period of research on nickel, etc., was evidently a trying one, for\r\nafter nearly a month's close application he writes, on January 27, 1879:\r\n\"Owing to the enormous power of the light my eyes commenced to pain\r\nafter seven hours' work, and I had to quit.\" On the next day appears\r\nthe following entry: \"Suffered the pains of hell with my eyes last night\r\nfrom 10 P.M. till 4 A.M., when got to sleep with a big dose of morphine.\r\nEyes getting better, and do not pain much at 4 P.M.; but I lose to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"try everything\" spirit of Edison's method is well illustrated in\r\nthis early period by a series of about sixteen hundred resistance tests\r\nof various ores, minerals, earths, etc., occupying over fifty pages of\r\none of the note-books relating to the metallic filament for his lamps.\r\n\r\nBut, as the reader has already learned, the metallic filament was soon\r\nlaid aside in favor of carbon, and we find in the laboratory notes an\r\namazing record of research and experiment conducted in the minute\r\nand searching manner peculiar to Edison's method. His inquiries were\r\ndirected along all the various roads leading to the desired goal,\r\nfor long before he had completed the invention of a practical lamp he\r\nrealized broadly the fundamental requirements of a successful system of\r\nelectrical distribution, and had given instructions for the making of\r\na great variety of calculations which, although far in advance of\r\nthe time, were clearly foreseen by him to be vitally important in the\r\nultimate solution of the complicated problem. Thus we find many hundreds\r\nof pages of the note-books covered with computations and calculations\r\nby Mr. Upton, not only on the numerous ramifications of the projected\r\nsystem and comparisons with gas, but also on proposed forms of dynamos\r\nand the proposed station in New York. A mere recital by titles of\r\nthe vast number of experiments and tests on carbons, lamps, dynamos,\r\narmatures, commutators, windings, systems, regulators, sockets,\r\nvacuum-pumps, and the thousand and one details relating to the subject\r\nin general, originated by Edison, and methodically and systematically\r\ncarried on under his general direction, would fill a great many pages\r\nhere, and even then would serve only to convey a confused impression of\r\nceaseless probing.\r\n\r\nIt is possible only to a broad, comprehensive mind well stored with\r\nknowledge, and backed with resistless, boundless energy, that such a\r\ndiversified series of experiments and investigations could be carried\r\non simultaneously and assimilated, even though they should relate to a\r\nclass of phenomena already understood and well defined. But if we pause\r\nto consider that the commercial subdivision of the electric current\r\n(which was virtually an invention made to order) involved the solution\r\nof problems so unprecedented that even they themselves had to be\r\ncreated, we cannot but conclude that the afflatus of innate genius\r\nplayed an important part in the unique methods of investigation\r\ninstituted by Edison at that and other times.\r\n\r\nThe idea of attributing great successes to \"genius\" has always been\r\nrepudiated by Edison, as evidenced by his historic remark that \"Genius\r\nis 1 per cent. inspiration and 99 per cent. perspiration.\" Again, in a\r\nconversation many years ago at the laboratory between Edison, Batchelor,\r\nand E. H. Johnson, the latter made allusion to Edison's genius as\r\nevidenced by some of his achievements, when Edison replied:\r\n\r\n\"Stuff! I tell you genius is hard work, stick-to-it-iveness, and common\r\nsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Johnson, \"I admit there is all that to it, but there's still\r\nmore. Batch and I have those qualifications, but although we knew quite\r\na lot about telephones, and worked hard, we couldn't invent a brand-new\r\nnon-infringing telephone receiver as you did when Gouraud cabled for\r\none. Then, how about the subdivision of the electric light?\"\r\n\r\n\"Electric current,\" corrected Edison.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" continued Johnson; \"you were the one to make that very\r\ndistinction. The scientific world had been working hard on subdivision\r\nfor years, using what appeared to be common sense. Results worse than\r\nnil. Then you come along, and about the first thing you do, after\r\nlooking the ground over, is to start off in the opposite direction,\r\nwhich subsequently proves to be the only possible way to reach the goal.\r\nIt seems to me that this is pretty close to the dictionary definition of\r\ngenius.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that Edison replied rather incoherently and changed the topic\r\nof conversation.\r\n\r\nThis innate modesty, however, does not prevent Edison from recognizing\r\nand classifying his own methods of investigation. In a conversation with\r\ntwo old associates recently (April, 1909), he remarked: \"It has been\r\nsaid of me that my methods are empirical. That is true only so far\r\nas chemistry is concerned. Did you ever realize that practically all\r\nindustrial chemistry is colloidal in its nature? Hard rubber, celluloid,\r\nglass, soap, paper, and lots of others, all have to deal with amorphous\r\nsubstances, as to which comparatively little has been really settled.\r\nMy methods are similar to those followed by Luther Burbank. He plants an\r\nacre, and when this is in bloom he inspects it. He has a sharp eye, and\r\ncan pick out of thousands a single plant that has promise of what he\r\nwants. From this he gets the seed, and uses his skill and knowledge in\r\nproducing from it a number of new plants which, on development, furnish\r\nthe means of propagating an improved variety in large quantity. So, when\r\nI am after a chemical result that I have in mind, I may make hundreds\r\nor thousands of experiments out of which there may be one that promises\r\nresults in the right direction. This I follow up to its legitimate\r\nconclusion, discarding the others, and usually get what I am after.\r\nThere is no doubt about this being empirical; but when it comes to\r\nproblems of a mechanical nature, I want to tell you that all I've\r\never tackled and solved have been done by hard, logical thinking.\" The\r\nintense earnestness and emphasis with which this was said were very\r\nimpressive to the auditors. This empirical method may perhaps be better\r\nillustrated by a specific example. During the latter part of the storage\r\nbattery investigations, after the form of positive element had been\r\ndetermined upon, it became necessary to ascertain what definite\r\nproportions and what quality of nickel hydrate and nickel flake would\r\ngive the best results. A series of positive tubes were filled with the\r\ntwo materials in different proportions--say, nine parts hydrate to one\r\nof flake; eight parts hydrate to two of flake; seven parts hydrate to\r\nthree of flake, and so on through varying proportions. Three sets of\r\neach of these positives were made, and all put into separate test tubes\r\nwith a uniform type of negative element. These were carried through a\r\nlong series of charges and discharges under strict test conditions. From\r\nthe tabulated results of hundreds of tests there were selected\r\nthree that showed the best results. These, however, showed only the\r\nsuperiority of certain PROPORTIONS of the materials. The next step\r\nwould be to find out the best QUALITY. Now, as there are several hundred\r\nvariations in the quality of nickel flake, and perhaps a thousand ways\r\nto make the hydrate, it will be realized that Edison's methods led to\r\nstupendous detail, for these tests embraced a trial of all the qualities\r\nof both materials in the three proportions found to be most suitable.\r\nAmong these many thousands of experiments any that showed extraordinary\r\nresults were again elaborated by still further series of tests, until\r\nEdison was satisfied that he had obtained the best result in that\r\nparticular line.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory note-books do not always tell the whole story or meaning\r\nof an experiment that may be briefly outlined on one of their pages. For\r\nexample, the early filament made of a mixture of lampblack and tar is\r\nmerely a suggestion in the notes, but its making afforded an example\r\nof Edison's pertinacity. These materials, when mixed, became a friable\r\nmass, which he had found could be brought into such a cohesive,\r\nputty-like state by manipulation, as to be capable of being rolled out\r\ninto filaments as fine as seven-thousandths of an inch in cross-section.\r\nOne of the laboratory assistants was told to make some of this mixture,\r\nknead it, and roll some filaments. After a time he brought the mass to\r\nEdison, and said:\r\n\r\n\"There's something wrong about this, for it crumbles even after\r\nmanipulating it with my fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did you knead it?\" said Edison.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! more than an hour,\" replied the assistant.\r\n\r\n\"Well, just keep on for a few hours more and it will come out all\r\nright,\" was the rejoinder. And this proved to be correct, for, after\r\na prolonged kneading and rolling, the mass changed into a cohesive,\r\nstringy, homogeneous putty. It was from a mixture of this kind that\r\nspiral filaments were made and used in some of the earliest forms\r\nof successful incandescent lamps; indeed, they are described and\r\nillustrated in Edison's fundamental lamp patent (No. 223,898).\r\n\r\nThe present narrative would assume the proportions of a history of\r\nthe incandescent lamp, should the authors attempt to follow Edison's\r\ninvestigations through the thousands of pages of note-books away back in\r\nthe eighties and early nineties. Improvement of the lamp was constantly\r\nin his mind all those years, and besides the vast amount of detail\r\nexperimental work he laid out for his assistants, he carried on a great\r\ndeal of research personally. Sometimes whole books are filled in his\r\nown handwriting with records of experiments showing every conceivable\r\nvariation of some particular line of inquiry; each trial bearing some\r\nterse comment expressive of results. In one book appear the details of\r\none of these experiments on September 3, 1891, at 4.30 A.M., with the\r\ncomment: \"Brought up lamp higher than a 16-c.p. 240 was ever brought\r\nbefore--Hurrah!\" Notwithstanding the late hour, he turns over to the\r\nnext page and goes on to write his deductions from this result as\r\ncompared with those previously obtained. Proceeding day by day, as\r\nappears by this same book, he follows up another line of investigation\r\non lamps, apparently full of difficulty, for after one hundred and\r\nthirty-two other recorded experiments we find this note: \"Saturday 3.30\r\nwent home disgusted with incandescent lamps.\" This feeling was evidently\r\nevanescent, for on the succeeding Monday the work was continued and\r\ncarried on by him as keenly as before, as shown by the next batch of\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThis is the only instance showing any indication of impatience that the\r\nauthors have found in looking through the enormous mass of laboratory\r\nnotes. All his assistants agree that Edison is the most patient,\r\ntireless experimenter that could be conceived of. Failures do not\r\ndistress him; indeed, he regards them as always useful, as may be\r\ngathered from the following, related by Dr. E. G. Acheson, formerly one\r\nof his staff: \"I once made an experiment in Edison's laboratory at Menlo\r\nPark during the latter part of 1880, and the results were not as looked\r\nfor. I considered the experiment a perfect failure, and while bemoaning\r\nthe results of this apparent failure Mr. Edison entered, and, after\r\nlearning the facts of the case, cheerfully remarked that I should not\r\nlook upon it as a failure, for he considered every experiment a success,\r\nas in all cases it cleared up the atmosphere, and even though it failed\r\nto accomplish the results sought for, it should prove a valuable lesson\r\nfor guidance in future work. I believe that Mr. Edison's success as\r\nan experimenter was, to a large extent, due to this happy view of all\r\nexperiments.\"\r\n\r\nEdison has frequently remarked that out of a hundred experiments he\r\ndoes not expect more than one to be successful, and as to that one he\r\nis always suspicious until frequent repetition has verified the original\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThis patient, optimistic view of the outcome of experiments has remained\r\npart of his character down to this day, just as his painstaking, minute,\r\nincisive methods are still unchanged. But to the careless, stupid, or\r\nlazy person he is a terror for the short time they remain around him.\r\nHonest mistakes may be tolerated, but not carelessness, incompetence,\r\nor lack of attention to business. In such cases Edison is apt to express\r\nhimself freely and forcibly, as when he was asked why he had parted with\r\na certain man, he said: \"Oh, he was so slow that it would take him half\r\nan hour to get out of the field of a microscope.\" Another instance will\r\nbe illustrative. Soon after the Brockton (Massachusetts) central station\r\nwas started in operation many years ago, he wrote a note to Mr. W. S.\r\nAndrews, containing suggestions as to future stations, part of which\r\nrelated to the various employees and their duties. After outlining the\r\nduties of the meter man, Edison says: \"I should not take too young a man\r\nfor this, say, a man from twenty-three to thirty years old, bright and\r\nbusinesslike. Don't want any one who yearns to enter a laboratory and\r\nexperiment. We have a bad case of that at Brockton; he neglects business\r\nto potter. What we want is a good lamp average and no unprofitable\r\ncustomer. You should have these men on probation and subject to passing\r\nan examination by me. This will wake them up.\"\r\n\r\nEdison's examinations are no joke, according to Mr. J. H. Vail, formerly\r\none of the Menlo Park staff. \"I wanted a job,\" he said, \"and was\r\nambitious to take charge of the dynamo-room. Mr. Edison led me to a heap\r\nof junk in a corner and said: 'Put that together and let me know\r\nwhen it's running.' I didn't know what it was, but received a liberal\r\neducation in finding out. It proved to be a dynamo, which I finally\r\nsucceeded in assembling and running. I got the job.\" Another man who\r\nsucceeded in winning a place as assistant was Mr. John F. Ott, who has\r\nremained in his employ for over forty years. In 1869, when Edison was\r\noccupying his first manufacturing shop (the third floor of a small\r\nbuilding in Newark), he wanted a first-class mechanician, and Mr. Ott\r\nwas sent to him. \"He was then an ordinary-looking young fellow,\" says\r\nMr. Ott, \"dirty as any of the other workmen, unkempt, and not much\r\nbetter dressed than a tramp, but I immediately felt that there was a\r\ngreat deal in him.\" This is the conversation that ensued, led by Mr.\r\nEdison's question:\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you make this machine work?\" (exhibiting it and explaining its\r\ndetails).\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you needn't pay me if I don't.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus Mr. Ott went to work and succeeded in accomplishing the results\r\ndesired. Two weeks afterward Mr. Edison put him in charge of the shop.\r\n\r\nEdison's life fairly teems with instances of unruffled patience in the\r\npursuit of experiments. When he feels thoroughly impressed with the\r\npossibility of accomplishing a certain thing, he will settle down\r\ncomposedly to investigate it to the end.\r\n\r\nThis is well illustrated in a story relating to his invention of the\r\ntype of storage battery bearing his name. Mr. W. S. Mallory, one of his\r\nclosest associates for many years, is the authority for the following:\r\n\"When Mr. Edison decided to shut down the ore-milling plant at Edison,\r\nNew Jersey, in which I had been associated with him, it became a\r\nproblem as to what he could profitably take up next, and we had several\r\ndiscussions about it. He finally thought that a good storage battery\r\nwas a great requisite, and decided to try and devise a new type, for he\r\ndeclared emphatically he would make no battery requiring sulphuric acid.\r\nAfter a little thought he conceived the nickel-iron idea, and started to\r\nwork at once with characteristic energy. About 7 or 7.30 A.M. he would\r\ngo down to the laboratory and experiment, only stopping for a short time\r\nat noon to eat a lunch sent down from the house. About 6 o'clock the\r\ncarriage would call to take him to dinner, from which he would return by\r\n7.30 or 8 o'clock to resume work. The carriage came again at midnight\r\nto take him home, but frequently had to wait until 2 or 3 o'clock, and\r\nsometimes return without him, as he had decided to continue all night.\r\n\r\n\"This had been going on more than five months, seven days a week, when\r\nI was called down to the laboratory to see him. I found him at a bench\r\nabout three feet wide and twelve to fifteen feet long, on which there\r\nwere hundreds of little test cells that had been made up by his corps\r\nof chemists and experimenters. He was seated at this bench testing,\r\nfiguring, and planning. I then learned that he had thus made over\r\nnine thousand experiments in trying to devise this new type of storage\r\nbattery, but had not produced a single thing that promised to solve\r\nthe question. In view of this immense amount of thought and labor, my\r\nsympathy got the better of my judgment, and I said: 'Isn't it a shame\r\nthat with the tremendous amount of work you have done you haven't been\r\nable to get any results?' Edison turned on me like a flash, and with\r\na smile replied: 'Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results! I\r\nknow several thousand things that won't work.'\r\n\r\n\"At that time he sent me out West on a special mission. On my return, a\r\nfew weeks later, his experiments had run up to over ten thousand, but\r\nhe had discovered the missing link in the combination sought for. Of\r\ncourse, we all remember how the battery was completed and put on the\r\nmarket. Then, because he was dissatisfied with it, he stopped the sales\r\nand commenced a new line of investigation, which has recently culminated\r\nsuccessfully. I shouldn't wonder if his experiments on the battery ran\r\nup pretty near to fifty thousand, for they fill more than one hundred\r\nand fifty of the note-books, to say nothing of some thousands of tests\r\nin curve sheets.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Edison has an absolute disregard for the total outlay of money\r\nin investigation, he is particular to keep down the cost of individual\r\nexperiments to a minimum, for, as he observed to one of his assistants:\r\n\"A good many inventors try to develop things life-size, and thus spend\r\nall their money, instead of first experimenting more freely on a small\r\nscale.\" To Edison life is not only a grand opportunity to find out\r\nthings by experiment, but, when found, to improve them by further\r\nexperiment. One night, after receiving a satisfactory report of progress\r\nfrom Mr. Mason, superintendent of the cement plant, he said: \"The only\r\nway to keep ahead of the procession is to experiment. If you don't, the\r\nother fellow will. When there's no experimenting there's no progress.\r\nStop experimenting and you go backward. If anything goes wrong,\r\nexperiment until you get to the very bottom of the trouble.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to realize, therefore, that a character so thoroughly\r\npermeated with these ideas is not apt to stop and figure out expense\r\nwhen in hot pursuit of some desired object. When that object has been\r\nattained, however, and it passes from the experimental to the commercial\r\nstage, Edison's monetary views again come into strong play, but they\r\ntake a diametrically opposite position, for he then begins immediately\r\nto plan the extreme of economy in the production of the article. A\r\nthousand and one instances could be quoted in illustration; but as\r\nthey would tend to change the form of this narrative into a history of\r\neconomy in manufacture, it will suffice to mention but one, and that a\r\nrecent occurrence, which serves to illustrate how closely he keeps in\r\ntouch with everything, and also how the inventive faculty and instinct\r\nof commercial economy run close together. It was during Edison's winter\r\nstay in Florida, in March, 1909. He had reports sent to him daily\r\nfrom various places, and studied them carefully, for he would write\r\nfrequently with comments, instructions, and suggestions; and in one\r\ncase, commenting on the oiling system at the cement plant, he wrote:\r\n\"Your oil losses are now getting lower, I see.\" Then, after suggesting\r\nsome changes to reduce them still further, he went on to say: \"Here is a\r\nchance to save a mill per barrel based on your regular daily output.\"\r\n\r\nThis thorough consideration of the smallest detail is essentially\r\ncharacteristic of Edison, not only in economy of manufacture, but in\r\nall his work, no matter of what kind, whether it be experimenting,\r\ninvestigating, testing, or engineering. To follow him through the\r\nlabyrinthine paths of investigation contained in the great array of\r\nlaboratory note-books is to become involved in a mass of minutely\r\ndetailed searches which seek to penetrate the inmost recesses of nature\r\nby an ultimate analysis of an infinite variety of parts. As the reader\r\nwill obtain a fuller comprehension of this idea, and of Edison's\r\nmethods, by concrete illustration rather than by generalization, the\r\nauthors have thought it well to select at random two typical instances\r\nof specific investigations out of the thousands that are scattered\r\nthrough the notebooks. These will be found in the following extracts\r\nfrom one of the note-books, and consist of Edison's instructions to be\r\ncarried out in detail by his experimenters:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Take, say, 25 lbs. hard Cuban asphalt and separate all the different\r\nhydrocarbons, etc., as far as possible by means of solvents. It will be\r\nnecessary first to dissolve everything out by, say, hot turpentine, then\r\nsuccessively treat the residue with bisulphide carbon, benzol, ether,\r\nchloroform, naphtha, toluol, alcohol, and other probable solvents.\r\nAfter you can go no further, distil off all the solvents so the asphalt\r\nmaterial has a tar-like consistency. Be sure all the ash is out of the\r\nturpentine portion; now, after distilling the turpentine off, act on the\r\nresidue with all the solvents that were used on the residue, using for\r\nthe first the solvent which is least likely to dissolve a great part\r\nof it. By thus manipulating the various solvents you will be\r\nenabled probably to separate the crude asphalt into several distinct\r\nhydrocarbons. Put each in a bottle after it has been dried, and label\r\nthe bottle with the process, etc., so we may be able to duplicate it;\r\nalso give bottle a number and describe everything fully in note-book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Destructively distil the following substances down to a point just\r\nshort of carbonization, so that the residuum can be taken out of the\r\nretort, powdered, and acted on by all the solvents just as the asphalt\r\nin previous page. The distillation should be carried to, say, 600\r\ndegrees or 700 degrees Fahr., but not continued long enough to wholly\r\nreduce mass to charcoal, but always run to blackness. Separate the\r\nresiduum in as many definite parts as possible, bottle and label, and\r\nkeep accurate records as to process, weights, etc., so a reproduction of\r\nthe experiment can at any time be made: Gelatine, 4 lbs.; asphalt, hard\r\nCuban, 10 lbs.; coal-tar or pitch, 10 lbs.; wood-pitch, 10 lbs.;\r\nSyrian asphalt, 10 lbs.; bituminous coal, 10 lbs.; cane-sugar, 10 lbs.;\r\nglucose, 10 lbs.; dextrine, 10 lbs.; glycerine, 10 lbs.; tartaric acid,\r\n5 lbs.; gum guiac, 5 lbs.; gum amber, 3 lbs.; gum tragacanth, 3 Lbs.;\r\naniline red, 1 lb.; aniline oil, 1 lb.; crude anthracene, 5 lbs.;\r\npetroleum pitch, 10 lbs.; albumen from eggs, 2 lbs.; tar from passing\r\nchlorine through aniline oil, 2 lbs.; citric acid, 5 lbs.; sawdust of\r\nboxwood, 3 lbs.; starch, 5 lbs.; shellac, 3 lbs.; gum Arabic, 5 lbs.;\r\ncastor oil, 5 lbs.\"\r\n\r\nThe empirical nature of his method will be apparent from an examination\r\nof the above items; but in pursuing it he leaves all uncertainty\r\nbehind and, trusting nothing to theory, he acquires absolute knowledge.\r\nWhatever may be the mental processes by which he arrives at the\r\nstarting-point of any specific line of research, the final results\r\nalmost invariably prove that he does not plunge in at random; indeed,\r\nas an old associate remarked: \"When Edison takes up any proposition\r\nin natural science, his perceptions seem to be elementally broad and\r\nanalytical, that is to say, in addition to the knowledge he has acquired\r\nfrom books and observation, he appears to have an intuitive apprehension\r\nof the general order of things, as they might be supposed to exist in\r\nnatural relation to each other. It has always seemed to me that he goes\r\nto the core of things at once.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough nothing less than results from actual experiments are\r\nacceptable to him as established facts, this view of Edison may\r\nalso account for his peculiar and somewhat weird ability to \"guess\"\r\ncorrectly, a faculty which has frequently enabled him to take short\r\ncuts to lines of investigation whose outcome has verified in a most\r\nremarkable degree statements apparently made offhand and without\r\ncalculation. Mr. Upton says: \"One of the main impressions left upon me,\r\nafter knowing Mr. Edison for many years, is the marvellous accuracy of\r\nhis guesses. He will see the general nature of a result long before it\r\ncan be reached by mathematical calculation.\" This was supplemented by\r\none of his engineering staff, who remarked: \"Mr. Edison can guess better\r\nthan a good many men can figure, and so far as my experience goes, I\r\nhave found that he is almost invariably correct. His guess is more than\r\na mere starting-point, and often turns out to be the final solution of\r\na problem. I can only account for it by his remarkable insight and\r\nwonderful natural sense of the proportion of things, in addition to\r\nwhich he seems to carry in his head determining factors of all\r\nkinds, and has the ability to apply them instantly in considering any\r\nmechanical problem.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this mysterious intuitive power has been of the greatest advantage\r\nin connection with the vast number of technical problems that have\r\nentered into his life-work, there have been many remarkable instances\r\nin which it has seemed little less than prophecy, and it is deemed worth\r\nwhile to digress to the extent of relating two of them. One day in\r\nthe summer of 1881, when the incandescent lamp-industry was still\r\nin swaddling clothes, Edison was seated in the room of Major Eaton,\r\nvice-president of the Edison Electric Light Company, talking over\r\nbusiness matters, when Mr. Upton came in from the lamp factory at\r\nMenlo Park, and said: \"Well, Mr. Edison, we completed a thousand\r\nlamps to-day.\" Edison looked up and said \"Good,\" then relapsed into\r\na thoughtful mood. In about two minutes he raised his head, and said:\r\n\"Upton, in fifteen years you will be making forty thousand lamps a day.\"\r\nNone of those present ventured to make any remark on this assertion,\r\nalthough all felt that it was merely a random guess, based on the\r\nsanguine dream of an inventor. The business had not then really made a\r\nstart, and being entirely new was without precedent upon which to base\r\nany such statement, but, as a matter of fact, the records of the lamp\r\nfactory show that in 1896 its daily output of lamps was actually about\r\nforty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe other instance referred to occurred shortly after the Edison Machine\r\nWorks was moved up to Schenectady, in 1886. One day, when he was at the\r\nworks, Edison sat down and wrote on a sheet of paper fifteen separate\r\npredictions of the growth and future of the electrical business.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the industry was then in an immature\r\nstate, and that the great boom did not set in until a few years\r\nafterward, twelve of these predictions have been fully verified by the\r\nenormous growth and development in all branches of the art.\r\n\r\nWhat the explanation of this gift, power, or intuition may be, is\r\nperhaps better left to the psychologist to speculate upon. If one were\r\nto ask Edison, he would probably say, \"Hard work, not too much sleep,\r\nand free use of the imagination.\" Whether or not it would be possible\r\nfor the average mortal to arrive at such perfection of \"guessing\" by\r\nfaithfully following this formula, even reinforced by the Edison\r\nrecipe for stimulating a slow imagination with pastry, is open for\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nSomewhat allied to this curious faculty is another no less remarkable,\r\nand that is, the ability to point out instantly an error in a mass of\r\nreported experimental results. While many instances could be definitely\r\nnamed, a typical one, related by Mr. J. D. Flack, formerly master\r\nmechanic at the lamp factory, may be quoted: \"During the many years\r\nof lamp experimentation, batches of lamps were sent to the photometer\r\ndepartment for test, and Edison would examine the tabulated test sheets.\r\nHe ran over every item of the tabulations rapidly, and, apparently\r\nwithout any calculation whatever, would check off errors as fast as he\r\ncame to them, saying: 'You have made a mistake; try this one over.'\r\nIn every case the second test proved that he was right. This wonderful\r\naptitude for infallibly locating an error without an instant's\r\nhesitation for mental calculation, has always appealed to me very\r\nforcibly.\"\r\n\r\nThe ability to detect errors quickly in a series of experiments is one\r\nof the things that has enabled Edison to accomplish such a vast amount\r\nof work as the records show. Examples of the minuteness of detail into\r\nwhich his researches extend have already been mentioned, and as\r\nthere are always a number of such investigations in progress at the\r\nlaboratory, this ability stands Edison in good stead, for he is thus\r\nenabled to follow, and, if necessary, correct each one step by step.\r\nIn this he is aided by the great powers of a mind that is able to free\r\nitself from absorbed concentration on the details of one problem, and\r\ninstantly to shift over and become deeply and intelligently concentrated\r\nin another and entirely different one. For instance, he may have been\r\nbusy for hours on chemical experiments, and be called upon suddenly to\r\ndetermine some mechanical questions. The complete and easy transition\r\nis the constant wonder of his associates, for there is no confusion\r\nof ideas resulting from these quick changes, no hesitation or apparent\r\neffort, but a plunge into the midst of the new subject, and an instant\r\nacquaintance with all its details, as if he had been studying it for\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nA good stiff difficulty--one which may, perhaps, appear to be an\r\nunsurmountable obstacle--only serves to make Edison cheerful, and brings\r\nout variations of his methods in experimenting. Such an occurrence will\r\nstart him thinking, which soon gives rise to a line of suggestions for\r\napproaching the trouble from various sides; or he will sit down and\r\nwrite out a series of eliminations, additions, or changes to be worked\r\nout and reported upon, with such variations as may suggest themselves\r\nduring their progress. It is at such times as these that his unfailing\r\npatience and tremendous resourcefulness are in evidence. Ideas and\r\nexpedients are poured forth in a torrent, and although some of them have\r\ntemporarily appeared to the staff to be ridiculous or irrelevant, they\r\nhave frequently turned out to be the ones leading to a correct solution\r\nof the trouble.\r\n\r\nEdison's inexhaustible resourcefulness and fertility of ideas have\r\ncontributed largely to his great success, and have ever been a cause of\r\namazement to those around him. Frequently, when it would seem to others\r\nthat the extreme end of an apparently blind alley had been reached, and\r\nthat it was impossible to proceed further, he has shown that there were\r\nseveral ways out of it. Examples without number could be quoted, but\r\none must suffice by way of illustration. During the progress of the\r\nore-milling work at Edison, it became desirable to carry on a certain\r\noperation by some special machinery. He requested the proper person on\r\nhis engineering staff to think this matter up and submit a few sketches\r\nof what he would propose to do. He brought three drawings to Edison, who\r\nexamined them and said none of them would answer. The engineer remarked\r\nthat it was too bad, for there was no other way to do it. Mr. Edison\r\nturned to him quickly, and said: \"Do you mean to say that these drawings\r\nrepresent the only way to do this work?\" To which he received the reply:\r\n\"I certainly do.\" Edison said nothing. This happened on a Saturday. He\r\nfollowed his usual custom of spending Sunday at home in Orange. When he\r\nreturned to the works on Monday morning, he took with him sketches he\r\nhad made, showing FORTY-EIGHT other ways of accomplishing the desired\r\noperation, and laid them on the engineer's desk without a word.\r\nSubsequently one of these ideas, with modifications suggested by some of\r\nthe others, was put into successful practice.\r\n\r\nDifficulties seem to have a peculiar charm for Edison, whether they\r\nrelate to large or small things; and although the larger matters have\r\ncontributed most to the history of the arts, the same carefulness of\r\nthought has often been the means of leading to improvements of permanent\r\nadvantage even in minor details. For instance, in the very earliest days\r\nof electric lighting, the safe insulation of two bare wires fastened\r\ntogether was a serious problem that was solved by him. An iron pot over\r\na fire, some insulating material melted therein, and narrow strips of\r\nlinen drawn through it by means of a wooden clamp, furnished a readily\r\napplied and adhesive insulation, which was just as perfect for the\r\npurpose as the regular and now well-known insulating tape, of which it\r\nwas the forerunner.\r\n\r\nDubious results are not tolerated for a moment in Edison's experimental\r\nwork. Rather than pass upon an uncertainty, the experiment will be\r\ndissected and checked minutely in order to obtain absolute knowledge,\r\npro and con. This searching method is followed not only in chemical or\r\nother investigations, into which complexities might naturally enter,\r\nbut also in more mechanical questions, where simplicity of construction\r\nmight naturally seem to preclude possibilities of uncertainty. For\r\ninstance, at the time when he was making strenuous endeavors to obtain\r\ncopper wire of high conductivity, strict laboratory tests were made of\r\nsamples sent by manufacturers. One of these samples tested out poorer\r\nthan a previous lot furnished from the same factory. A report of this to\r\nEdison brought the following note: \"Perhaps the ---- wire had a bad spot\r\nin it. Please cut it up into lengths and test each one and send results\r\nto me immediately.\" Possibly the electrical fraternity does not realize\r\nthat this earnest work of Edison, twenty-eight years ago, resulted in\r\nthe establishment of the high quality of copper wire that has been\r\nthe recognized standard since that time. Says Edison on this point:\r\n\"I furnished the expert and apparatus to the Ansonia Brass and Copper\r\nCompany in 1883, and he is there yet. It was this expert and this\r\ncompany who pioneered high-conductivity copper for the electrical\r\ntrade.\"\r\n\r\nNor is it generally appreciated in the industry that the adoption of\r\nwhat is now regarded as a most obvious proposition--the high-economy\r\nincandescent lamp--was the result of that characteristic foresight which\r\nthere has been occasion to mention frequently in the course of this\r\nnarrative, together with the courage and \"horse-sense\" which have\r\nalways been displayed by the inventor in his persistent pushing out\r\nwith far-reaching ideas, in the face of pessimistic opinions. As is\r\nwell known, the lamps of the first ten or twelve years of incandescent\r\nlighting were of low economy, but had long life. Edison's study of the\r\nsubject had led him to the conviction that the greatest growth of\r\nthe electric-lighting industry would be favored by a lamp taking less\r\ncurrent, but having shorter, though commercially economical life;\r\nand after gradually making improvements along this line he developed,\r\nfinally, a type of high-economy lamp which would introduce a most\r\nradical change in existing conditions, and lead ultimately to highly\r\nadvantageous results. His start on this lamp, and an expressed desire to\r\nhave it manufactured for regular use, filled even some of his business\r\nassociates with dismay, for they could see nothing but disaster ahead\r\nin forcing such a lamp on the market. His persistence and profound\r\nconviction of the ultimate results were so strong and his arguments so\r\nsound, however, that the campaign was entered upon. Although it took two\r\nor three years to convince the public of the correctness of his views,\r\nthe idea gradually took strong root, and has now become an integral\r\nprinciple of the business.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be noted that with remarkable prescience\r\nEdison saw the coming of the modern lamps of to-day, which, by reason of\r\ntheir small consumption of energy to produce a given candle-power, have\r\ndismayed central-station managers. A few years ago a consumption of 3.1\r\nwatts per candle-power might safely be assumed as an excellent average,\r\nand many stations fixed their rates and business on such a basis. The\r\nresults on income when the consumption, as in the new metallic-filament\r\nlamps, drops to 1.25 watts per candle can readily be imagined. Edison\r\nhas insisted that central stations are selling light and not current;\r\nand he points to the predicament now confronting them as truth of his\r\nassertion that when selling light they share in all the benefits of\r\nimprovement, but that when they sell current the consumer gets all\r\nthose benefits without division. The dilemma is encountered by central\r\nstations in a bewildered way, as a novel and unexpected experience; but\r\nEdison foresaw the situation and warned against it long ago. It is one\r\nof the greatest gifts of statesmanship to see new social problems years\r\nbefore they arise and solve them in advance. It is one of the greatest\r\nattributes of invention to foresee and meet its own problems in exactly\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE LABORATORY AT ORANGE AND THE STAFF\r\n\r\nA LIVING interrogation-point and a born investigator from childhood,\r\nEdison has never been without a laboratory of some kind for upward of\r\nhalf a century.\r\n\r\nIn youthful years, as already described in this book, he became ardently\r\ninterested in chemistry, and even at the early age of twelve felt the\r\nnecessity for a special nook of his own, where he could satisfy his\r\nunconvinced mind of the correctness or inaccuracy of statements and\r\nexperiments contained in the few technical books then at his command.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily he was like other normal lads of his age--full of boyish,\r\nhearty enjoyments--but withal possessed of an unquenchable spirit of\r\ninquiry and an insatiable desire for knowledge. Being blessed with a\r\nwise and discerning mother, his aspirations were encouraged; and he was\r\nallowed a corner in her cellar. It is fair to offer tribute here to her\r\nbravery as well as to her wisdom, for at times she was in mortal terror\r\nlest the precocious experimenter below should, in his inexperience, make\r\nsome awful combination that would explode and bring down the house in\r\nruins on himself and the rest of the family.\r\n\r\nFortunately no such catastrophe happened, but young Edison worked\r\naway in his embryonic laboratory, satisfying his soul and incidentally\r\ndepleting his limited pocket-money to the vanishing-point. It was,\r\nindeed, owing to this latter circumstance that in a year or two his\r\naspirations necessitated an increase of revenue; and a consequent\r\ndetermination to earn some money for himself led to his first real\r\ncommercial enterprise as \"candy butcher\" on the Grand Trunk Railroad,\r\nalready mentioned in a previous chapter. It has also been related how\r\nhis precious laboratory was transferred to the train; how he and it were\r\nsubsequently expelled; and how it was re-established in his home, where\r\nhe continued studies and experiments until the beginning of his career\r\nas a telegraph operator.\r\n\r\nThe nomadic life of the next few years did not lessen his devotion to\r\nstudy; but it stood seriously in the way of satisfying the ever-present\r\ncraving for a laboratory. The lack of such a place never prevented\r\nexperimentation, however, as long as he had a dollar in his pocket\r\nand some available \"hole in the wall.\" With the turning of the tide of\r\nfortune that suddenly carried him, in New York in 1869, from poverty\r\nto the opulence of $300 a month, he drew nearer to a realization of his\r\ncherished ambition in having money, place, and some time (stolen from\r\nsleep) for more serious experimenting. Thus matters continued until,\r\nat about the age of twenty-two, Edison's inventions had brought him a\r\nrelatively large sum of money, and he became a very busy manufacturer,\r\nand lessee of a large shop in Newark, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time since leaving that boyish laboratory in the old\r\nhome at Port Huron, Edison had a place of his own to work in, to think\r\nin; but no one in any way acquainted with Newark as a swarming centre\r\nof miscellaneous and multitudinous industries would recommend it as a\r\ncloistered retreat for brooding reverie and introspection, favorable to\r\ncreative effort. Some people revel in surroundings of hustle and bustle,\r\nand find therein no hindrance to great accomplishment. The electrical\r\ngenius of Newark is Edward Weston, who has thriven amid its turmoil\r\nand there has developed his beautiful instruments of precision; just\r\nas Brush worked out his arc-lighting system in Cleveland; or even as\r\nFaraday, surrounded by the din and roar of London, laid the intellectual\r\nfoundations of the whole modern science of dynamic electricity. But\r\nEdison, though deaf, could not make too hurried a retreat from Newark to\r\nMenlo Park, where, as if to justify his change of base, vital inventions\r\nsoon came thick and fast, year after year. The story of Menlo has been\r\ntold in another chapter, but the point was not emphasized that Edison\r\nthen, as later, tried hard to drop manufacturing. He would infinitely\r\nrather be philosopher than producer; but somehow the necessity of\r\nmanufacturing is constantly thrust back upon him by a profound--perhaps\r\nfinical--sense of dissatisfaction with what other people make for him.\r\nThe world never saw a man more deeply and desperately convinced that\r\nnothing in it approaches perfection. Edison is the doctrine of evolution\r\nincarnate, applied to mechanics. As to the removal from Newark, he may\r\nbe allowed to tell his own story: \"I had a shop at Newark in which I\r\nmanufactured stock tickers and such things. When I moved to Menlo Park\r\nI took out only the machinery that would be necessary for experimental\r\npurposes and left the manufacturing machinery in the place. It consisted\r\nof many milling machines and other tools for duplicating. I rented this\r\nto a man who had formerly been my bookkeeper, and who thought he could\r\nmake money out of manufacturing. There was about $10,000 worth of\r\nmachinery. He was to pay me $2000 a year for the rent of the machinery\r\nand keep it in good order. After I moved to Menlo Park, I was very\r\nbusy with the telephone and phonograph, and I paid no attention to this\r\nlittle arrangement. About three years afterward, it occurred to me that\r\nI had not heard at all from the man who had rented this machinery, so I\r\nthought I would go over to Newark and see how things were going. When I\r\ngot there, I found that instead of being a machine shop it was a hotel!\r\nI have since been utterly unable to find out what became of the man\r\nor the machinery.\" Such incidents tend to justify Edison in his rather\r\ncynical remark that he has always been able to improve machinery much\r\nquicker than men. All the way up he has had discouraging experiences.\r\n\"One day while I was carrying on my work in Newark, a Wall Street broker\r\ncame from the city and said he was tired of the 'Street,' and wanted to\r\ngo into something real. He said he had plenty of money. He wanted some\r\nkind of a job to keep his mind off Wall Street. So we gave him a job\r\nas a 'mucker' in chemical experiments. The second night he was there\r\nhe could not stand the long hours and fell asleep on a sofa. One of the\r\nboys took a bottle of bromine and opened it under the sofa. It floated\r\nup and produced a violent effect on the mucous membrane. The broker was\r\ntaken with such a fit of coughing he burst a blood-vessel, and the\r\nman who let the bromine out got away and never came back. I suppose he\r\nthought there was going to be a death. But the broker lived, and left\r\nthe next day; and I have never seen him since, either.\" Edison tells\r\nalso of another foolhardy laboratory trick of the same kind: \"Some of my\r\nassistants in those days were very green in the business, as I did not\r\ncare whether they had had any experience or not. I generally tried to\r\nturn them loose. One day I got a new man, and told him to conduct a\r\ncertain experiment. He got a quart of ether and started to boil it over\r\na naked flame. Of course it caught fire. The flame was about four\r\nfeet in diameter and eleven feet high. We had to call out the fire\r\ndepartment; and they came down and put a stream through the window. That\r\nlet all the fumes and chemicals out and overcame the firemen; and there\r\nwas the devil to pay. Another time we experimented with a tub full of\r\nsoapy water, and put hydrogen into it to make large bubbles. One of the\r\nboys, who was washing bottles in the place, had read in some book that\r\nhydrogen was explosive, so he proceeded to blow the tub up. There was\r\nabout four inches of soap in the bottom of the tub, fourteen inches\r\nhigh; and he filled it with soap bubbles up to the brim. Then he took a\r\nbamboo fish-pole, put a piece of paper at the end, and touched it off.\r\nIt blew every window out of the place.\"\r\n\r\nAlways a shrewd, observant, and kindly critic of character, Edison tells\r\nmany anecdotes of the men who gathered around him in various capacities\r\nat that quiet corner of New Jersey--Menlo Park--and later at Orange, in\r\nthe Llewellyn Park laboratory; and these serve to supplement the main\r\nnarrative by throwing vivid side-lights on the whole scene. Here, for\r\nexample, is a picture drawn by Edison of a laboratory interlude--just\r\na bit Rabelaisian: \"When experimenting at Menlo Park we had all the way\r\nfrom forty to fifty men. They worked all the time. Each man was allowed\r\nfrom four to six hours' sleep. We had a man who kept tally, and when the\r\ntime came for one to sleep, he was notified. At midnight we had lunch\r\nbrought in and served at a long table at which the experimenters\r\nsat down. I also had an organ which I procured from Hilbourne\r\nRoosevelt--uncle of the ex-President--and we had a man play this\r\norgan while we ate our lunch. During the summertime, after we had made\r\nsomething which was successful, I used to engage a brick-sloop at Perth\r\nAmboy and take the whole crowd down to the fishing-banks on the Atlantic\r\nfor two days. On one occasion we got outside Sandy Hook on the banks and\r\nanchored. A breeze came up, the sea became rough, and a large number of\r\nthe men were sick. There was straw in the bottom of the boat, which we\r\nall slept on. Most of the men adjourned to this straw very sick. Those\r\nwho were not got a piece of rancid salt pork from the skipper, and cut a\r\nlarge, thick slice out of it. This was put on the end of a fish-hook\r\nand drawn across the men's faces. The smell was terrific, and the effect\r\nadded to the hilarity of the excursion.\r\n\r\n\"I went down once with my father and two assistants for a little fishing\r\ninside Sandy Hook. For some reason or other the fishing was very poor.\r\nWe anchored, and I started in to fish. After fishing for several hours\r\nthere was not a single bite. The others wanted to pull up anchor, but\r\nI fished two days and two nights without a bite, until they pulled up\r\nanchor and went away. I would not give up. I was going to catch that\r\nfish if it took a week.\"\r\n\r\nThis is general. Let us quote one or two piquant personal observations\r\nof a more specific nature as to the odd characters Edison drew around\r\nhim in his experimenting. \"Down at Menlo Park a man came in one day and\r\nwanted a job. He was a sailor. I hadn't any particular work to give him,\r\nbut I had a number of small induction coils, and to give him something\r\nto do I told him to fix them up and sell them among his sailor friends.\r\nThey were fixed up, and he went over to New York and sold them all. He\r\nwas an extraordinary fellow. His name was Adams. One day I asked him how\r\nlong it was since he had been to sea, and he replied two or three years.\r\nI asked him how he had made a living in the mean time, before he came\r\nto Menlo Park. He said he made a pretty good living by going around to\r\ndifferent clinics and getting $10 at each clinic, because of having the\r\nworst case of heart-disease on record. I told him if that was the case\r\nhe would have to be very careful around the laboratory. I had him there\r\nto help in experimenting, and the heart-disease did not seem to bother\r\nhim at all.\r\n\r\n\"It appeared that he had once been a slaver; and altogether he was a\r\ntough character. Having no other man I could spare at that time, I sent\r\nhim over with my carbon transmitter telephone to exhibit it in England.\r\nIt was exhibited before the Post-Office authorities. Professor Hughes\r\nspent an afternoon in examining the apparatus, and in about a month came\r\nout with his microphone, which was absolutely nothing more nor less\r\nthan my exact invention. But no mention was made of the fact that, just\r\npreviously, he had seen the whole of my apparatus. Adams stayed over in\r\nEurope connected with the telephone for several years, and finally died\r\nof too much whiskey--but not of heart-disease. This shows how whiskey\r\nis the more dangerous of the two.\r\n\r\n\"Adams said that at one time he was aboard a coffee-ship in the harbor\r\nof Santos, Brazil. He fell down a hatchway and broke his arm. They took\r\nhim up to the hospital--a Portuguese one--where he could not speak the\r\nlanguage, and they did not understand English. They treated him for two\r\nweeks for yellow fever! He was certainly the most profane man we ever\r\nhad around the laboratory. He stood high in his class.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there were others of a different stripe. \"We had a man with us at\r\nMenlo called Segredor. He was a queer kind of fellow. The men got in the\r\nhabit of plaguing him; and, finally, one day he said to the assembled\r\nexperimenters in the top room of the laboratory: 'The next man that does\r\nit, I will kill him.' They paid no attention to this, and next day one\r\nof them made some sarcastic remark to him. Segredor made a start for\r\nhis boarding-house, and when they saw him coming back up the hill with\r\na gun, they knew there would be trouble, so they all made for the woods.\r\nOne of the men went back and mollified him. He returned to his work;\r\nbut he was not teased any more. At last, when I sent men out hunting for\r\nbamboo, I dispatched Segredor to Cuba. He arrived in Havana on Tuesday,\r\nand on the Friday following he was buried, having died of the black\r\nvomit. On the receipt of the news of his death, half a dozen of the men\r\nwanted his job, but my searcher in the Astor Library reported that the\r\nchances of finding the right kind of bamboo for lamps in Cuba were very\r\nsmall; so I did not send a substitute.\"\r\n\r\nAnother thumb-nail sketch made of one of his associates is this: \"When\r\nexperimenting with vacuum-pumps to exhaust the incandescent lamps, I\r\nrequired some very delicate and close manipulation of glass, and hired\r\na German glass-blower who was said to be the most expert man of his\r\nkind in the United States. He was the only one who could make clinical\r\nthermometers. He was the most extraordinarily conceited man I have ever\r\ncome across. His conceit was so enormous, life was made a burden to him\r\nby all the boys around the laboratory. He once said that he was educated\r\nin a university where all the students belonged to families of the\r\naristocracy; and the highest class in the university all wore little red\r\ncaps. He said HE wore one.\"\r\n\r\nOf somewhat different caliber was \"honest\" John Kruesi, who first made\r\nhis mark at Menlo Park, and of whom Edison says: \"One of the workmen\r\nI had at Menlo Park was John Kruesi, who afterward became, from his\r\nexperience, engineer of the lighting station, and subsequently engineer\r\nof the Edison General Electric Works at Schenectady. Kruesi was very\r\nexact in his expressions. At the time we were promoting and putting\r\nup electric-light stations in Pennsylvania, New York, and New England,\r\nthere would be delegations of different people who proposed to pay for\r\nthese stations. They would come to our office in New York, at '65,' to\r\ntalk over the specifications, the cost, and other things. At first, Mr.\r\nKruesi was brought in, but whenever a statement was made which he could\r\nnot understand or did not believe could be substantiated, he would blurt\r\nright out among these prospects that he didn't believe it. Finally it\r\ndisturbed these committees so much, and raised so many doubts in their\r\nminds, that one of my chief associates said: 'Here, Kruesi, we don't\r\nwant you to come to these meetings any longer. You are too painfully\r\nhonest.' I said to him: 'We always tell the truth. It may be deferred\r\ntruth, but it is the truth.' He could not understand that.\"\r\n\r\nVarious reasons conspired to cause the departure from Menlo Park midway\r\nin the eighties. For Edison, in spite of the achievement with which its\r\nname will forever be connected, it had lost all its attractions and all\r\nits possibilities. It had been outgrown in many ways, and strange as the\r\nremark may seem, it was not until he had left it behind and had settled\r\nin Orange, New Jersey, that he can be said to have given definite shape\r\nto his life. He was only forty in 1887, and all that he had done up to\r\nthat time, tremendous as much of it was, had worn a haphazard, Bohemian\r\nair, with all the inconsequential freedom and crudeness somehow\r\nattaching to pioneer life. The development of the new laboratory in West\r\nOrange, just at the foot of Llewellyn Park, on the Orange Mountains,\r\nnot only marked the happy beginning of a period of perfect domestic and\r\nfamily life, but saw in the planning and equipment of a model laboratory\r\nplant the consummation of youthful dreams, and of the keen desire to\r\nenjoy resources adequate at any moment to whatever strain the fierce\r\nfervor of research might put upon them. Curiously enough, while\r\nhitherto Edison had sought to dissociate his experimenting from his\r\nmanufacturing, here he determined to develop a large industry to which\r\na thoroughly practical laboratory would be a central feature, and ever a\r\nsource of suggestion and inspiration. Edison's standpoint to-day is that\r\nan evil to be dreaded in manufacture is that of over-standardization,\r\nand that as soon as an article is perfect that is the time to begin\r\nimproving it. But he who would improve must experiment.\r\n\r\nThe Orange laboratory, as originally planned, consisted of a main\r\nbuilding two hundred and fifty feet long and three stories in height,\r\ntogether with four other structures, each one hundred by twenty-five\r\nfeet, and only one story in height. All these were substantially built\r\nof brick. The main building was divided into five chief divisions--the\r\nlibrary, office, machine shops, experimental and chemical rooms,\r\nand stock-room. The use of the smaller buildings will be presently\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nSurrounding the whole was erected a high picket fence with a gate placed\r\non Valley Road. At this point a gate-house was provided and put in\r\ncharge of a keeper, for then, as at the present time, Edison was greatly\r\nsought after; and, in order to accomplish any work at all, he was\r\nobliged to deny himself to all but the most important callers. The\r\nkeeper of the gate was usually chosen with reference to his capacity\r\nfor stony-hearted implacability and adherence to instructions; and this\r\nchoice was admirably made in one instance when a new gateman, not yet\r\nthoroughly initiated, refused admittance to Edison himself. It was of no\r\nuse to try and explain. To the gateman EVERY ONE was persona non grata\r\nwithout proper credentials, and Edison had to wait outside until he\r\ncould get some one to identify him.\r\n\r\nOn entering the main building the first doorway from the ample passage\r\nleads the visitor into a handsome library finished throughout in yellow\r\npine, occupying the entire width of the building, and almost as broad\r\nas long. The centre of this spacious room is an open rectangular space\r\nabout forty by twenty-five feet, rising clear about forty feet from the\r\nmain floor to a panelled ceiling. Around the sides of the room, bounding\r\nthis open space, run two tiers of gallery, divided, as is the main floor\r\nbeneath them; into alcoves of liberal dimensions. These alcoves are\r\nformed by racks extending from floor to ceiling, fitted with shelves,\r\nexcept on two sides of both galleries, where they are formed by a series\r\nof glass-fronted cabinets containing extensive collections of curious\r\nand beautiful mineralogical and geological specimens, among which is\r\nthe notable Tiffany-Kunz collection of minerals acquired by Edison some\r\nyears ago. Here and there in these cabinets may also be found a\r\nfew models which he has used at times in his studies of anatomy and\r\nphysiology.\r\n\r\nThe shelves on the remainder of the upper gallery and part of those on\r\nthe first gallery are filled with countless thousands of specimens of\r\nores and minerals of every conceivable kind gathered from all parts of\r\nthe world, and all tagged and numbered. The remaining shelves of the\r\nfirst gallery are filled with current numbers (and some back numbers) of\r\nthe numerous periodicals to which Edison subscribes. Here may be\r\nfound the popular magazines, together with those of a technical nature\r\nrelating to electricity, chemistry, engineering, mechanics, building,\r\ncement, building materials, drugs, water and gas, power, automobiles,\r\nrailroads, aeronautics, philosophy, hygiene, physics, telegraphy,\r\nmining, metallurgy, metals, music, and others; also theatrical weeklies,\r\nas well as the proceedings and transactions of various learned and\r\ntechnical societies.\r\n\r\nThe first impression received as one enters on the main floor of the\r\nlibrary and looks around is that of noble proportions and symmetry as a\r\nwhole. The open central space of liberal dimensions and height, flanked\r\nby the galleries and relieved by four handsome electric-lighting\r\nfixtures suspended from the ceiling by long chains, conveys an idea of\r\nlofty spaciousness; while the huge open fireplace, surmounted by a great\r\nclock built into the wall, at one end of the room, the large rugs, the\r\narm-chairs scattered around, the tables and chairs in the alcoves, give\r\na general air of comfort combined with utility. In one of the larger\r\nalcoves, at the sunny end of the main hall, is Edison's own desk, where\r\nhe may usually be seen for a while in the early morning hours looking\r\nover his mail or otherwise busily working on matters requiring his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the room, not far from the open fireplace, is a\r\nlong table surrounded by swivel desk-chairs. It is here that directors'\r\nmeetings are sometimes held, and also where weighty matters are often\r\ndiscussed by Edison at conference with his closer associates. It\r\nhas been the privilege of the writers to be present at some of these\r\nconferences, not only as participants, but in some cases as lookers-on\r\nwhile awaiting their turn. On such occasions an interesting opportunity\r\nis offered to study Edison in his intense and constructive moods.\r\nApparently oblivious to everything else, he will listen with\r\nconcentrated mind and close attention, and then pour forth a perfect\r\ntorrent of ideas and plans, and, if the occasion calls for it, will turn\r\naround to the table, seize a writing-pad and make sketch after sketch\r\nwith lightning-like rapidity, tearing off each sheet as filled and\r\ntossing it aside to the floor. It is an ordinary indication that\r\nthere has been an interesting meeting when the caretaker about fills a\r\nwaste-basket with these discarded sketches.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposite the main door is a beautiful marble statue purchased\r\nby Edison at the Paris Exposition in 1889, on the occasion of his visit\r\nthere. The statue, mounted on a base three feet high, is an allegorical\r\nrepresentation of the supremacy of electric light over all other forms\r\nof illumination, carried out by the life-size figure of a youth with\r\nhalf-spread wings seated upon the ruins of a street gas-lamp, holding\r\ntriumphantly high above his head an electric incandescent lamp. Grouped\r\nabout his feet are a gear-wheel, voltaic pile, telegraph key, and\r\ntelephone. This work of art was executed by A. Bordiga, of Rome, held\r\na prominent place in the department devoted to Italian art at the Paris\r\nExposition, and naturally appealed to Edison as soon as he saw it.\r\n\r\nIn the middle distance, between the entrance door and this statue, has\r\nlong stood a magnificent palm, but at the present writing it has been\r\nset aside to give place to a fine model of the first type of the Edison\r\npoured cement house, which stands in a miniature artificial lawn upon\r\na special table prepared for it; while on the floor at the foot of the\r\ntable are specimens of the full-size molds in which the house will be\r\ncast.\r\n\r\nThe balustrades of the galleries and all other available places are\r\nfilled with portraits of great scientists and men of achievement, as\r\nwell as with pictures of historic and scientific interest. Over the\r\nfireplace hangs a large photograph showing the Edison cement plant\r\nin its entire length, flanked on one end of the mantel by a bust of\r\nHumboldt, and on the other by a statuette of Sandow, the latter having\r\nbeen presented to Edison by the celebrated athlete after the visit he\r\nmade to Orange to pose for the motion pictures in the earliest days of\r\ntheir development. On looking up under the second gallery at this end\r\nis seen a great roll resting in sockets placed on each side of the room.\r\nThis is a huge screen or curtain which may be drawn down to the floor to\r\nprovide a means of projection for lantern slides or motion pictures, for\r\nthe entertainment or instruction of Edison and his guests. In one of\r\nthe larger alcoves is a large terrestrial globe pivoted in its special\r\nstand, together with a relief map of the United States; and here and\r\nthere are handsomely mounted specimens of underground conductors and\r\nelectric welds that were made at the Edison Machine Works at Schenectady\r\nbefore it was merged into the General Electric Company. On two\r\npedestals stand, respectively, two other mementoes of the works, one\r\na fifteen-light dynamo of the Edison type, and the other an elaborate\r\nelectric fan--both of them gifts from associates or employees.\r\n\r\nIn noting these various objects of interest one must not lose sight\r\nof the fact that this part of the building is primarily a library,\r\nif indeed that fact did not at once impress itself by a glance at the\r\nwell-filled unglazed book-shelves in the alcoves of the main floor. Here\r\nEdison's catholic taste in reading becomes apparent as one scans the\r\ntitles of thousands of volumes ranged upon the shelves, for they include\r\nastronomy, botany, chemistry, dynamics, electricity, engineering,\r\nforestry, geology, geography, mechanics, mining, medicine, metallurgy,\r\nmagnetism, philosophy, psychology, physics, steam, steam-engines,\r\ntelegraphy, telephony, and many others. Besides these there are the\r\njournals and proceedings of numerous technical societies; encyclopaedias\r\nof various kinds; bound series of important technical magazines; a\r\ncollection of United States and foreign patents, embracing some hundreds\r\nof volumes, together with an extensive assortment of miscellaneous books\r\nof special and general interest. There is another big library up in\r\nthe house on the hill--in fact, there are books upon books all over the\r\nhome. And wherever they are, those books are read.\r\n\r\nAs one is about to pass out of the library attention is arrested by an\r\nincongruity in the form of a cot, which stands in an alcove near the\r\ndoor. Here Edison, throwing himself down, sometimes seeks a short rest\r\nduring specially long working tours. Sleep is practically instantaneous\r\nand profound, and he awakes in immediate and full possession of his\r\nfaculties, arising from the cot and going directly \"back to the job\"\r\nwithout a moment's hesitation, just as a person wide awake would arise\r\nfrom a chair and proceed to attend to something previously determined\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nImmediately outside the library is the famous stock-room, about which\r\nmuch has been written and invented. Its fame arose from the fact that\r\nEdison planned it to be a repository of some quantity, great or small,\r\nof every known and possibly useful substance not readily perishable,\r\ntogether with the most complete assortment of chemicals and drugs\r\nthat experience and knowledge could suggest. Always strenuous in his\r\nexperimentation, and the living embodiment of the spirit of the song, I\r\nWant What I Want When I Want It, Edison had known for years what it\r\nwas to be obliged to wait, and sometimes lack, for some substance or\r\nchemical that he thought necessary to the success of an experiment.\r\nNaturally impatient at any delay which interposed in his insistent\r\nand searching methods, and realizing the necessity of maintaining the\r\ninspiration attending his work at any time, he determined to have within\r\nhis immediate reach the natural resources of the world.\r\n\r\nHence it is not surprising to find the stock-room not only a museum,\r\nbut a sample-room of nature, as well as a supply department. To a\r\ncasual visitor the first view of this heterogeneous collection is quite\r\nbewildering, but on more mature examination it resolves itself into a\r\nnatural classification--as, for instance, objects pertaining to various\r\nanimals, birds, and fishes, such as skins, hides, hair, fur, feathers,\r\nwool, quills, down, bristles, teeth, bones, hoofs, horns, tusks, shells;\r\nnatural products, such as woods, barks, roots, leaves, nuts, seeds,\r\nherbs, gums, grains, flours, meals, bran; also minerals in great\r\nassortment; mineral and vegetable oils, clay, mica, ozokerite, etc. In\r\nthe line of textiles, cotton and silk threads in great variety, with\r\nwoven goods of all kinds from cheese-cloth to silk plush. As for paper,\r\nthere is everything in white and colored, from thinnest tissue up to the\r\nheaviest asbestos, even a few newspapers being always on hand. Twines\r\nof all sizes, inks, waxes, cork, tar, resin, pitch, turpentine, asphalt,\r\nplumbago, glass in sheets and tubes; and a host of miscellaneous\r\narticles revealed on looking around the shelves, as well as an\r\ninterminable collection of chemicals, including acids, alkalies,\r\nsalts, reagents, every conceivable essential oil and all the thinkable\r\nextracts. It may be remarked that this collection includes the eighteen\r\nhundred or more fluorescent salts made by Edison during his experimental\r\nsearch for the best material for a fluoroscope in the initial X-ray\r\nperiod. All known metals in form of sheet, rod and tube, and of great\r\nvariety in thickness, are here found also, together with a most complete\r\nassortment of tools and accessories for machine shop and laboratory\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe list is confined to the merest general mention of the scope of this\r\nremarkable and interesting collection, as specific details would\r\nstretch out into a catalogue of no small proportions. When it is stated,\r\nhowever, that a stock clerk is kept exceedingly busy all day answering\r\nthe numerous and various demands upon him, the reader will appreciate\r\nthat this comprehensive assortment is not merely a fad of Edison's,\r\nbut stands rather as a substantial tribute to his wide-angled view of\r\npossible requirements as his various investigations take him far afield.\r\nIt has no counterpart in the world!\r\n\r\nBeyond the stock-room, and occupying about half the building on the same\r\nfloor, lie a machine shop, engine-room, and boiler-room. This machine\r\nshop is well equipped, and in it is constantly employed a large force\r\nof mechanics whose time is occupied in constructing the heavier class of\r\nmodels and mechanical devices called for by the varied experiments and\r\ninventions always going on.\r\n\r\nImmediately above, on the second floor, is found another machine shop in\r\nwhich is maintained a corps of expert mechanics who are called upon to\r\ndo work of greater precision and fineness, in the construction of tools\r\nand experimental models. This is the realm presided over lovingly by\r\nJohn F. Ott, who has been Edison's designer of mechanical devices for\r\nover forty years. He still continues to ply his craft with unabated\r\nskill and oversees the work of the mechanics as his productions are\r\nwrought into concrete shape.\r\n\r\nIn one of the many experimental-rooms lining the sides of the second\r\nfloor may usually be seen his younger brother, Fred Ott, whose skill as\r\na dexterous manipulator and ingenious mechanic has found ample scope\r\nfor exercise during the thirty-two years of his service with Edison, not\r\nonly at the regular laboratories, but also at that connected with the\r\ninventor's winter home in Florida. Still another of the Ott family, the\r\nson of John F., for some years past has been on the experimental staff\r\nof the Orange laboratory. Although possessing in no small degree the\r\nmechanical and manipulative skill of the family, he has chosen chemistry\r\nas his special domain, and may be found with the other chemists in one\r\nof the chemical-rooms.\r\n\r\nOn this same floor is the vacuum-pump room with a glass-blowers' room\r\nadjoining, both of them historic by reason of the strenuous work done\r\non incandescent lamps and X-ray tubes within their walls. The tools and\r\nappliances are kept intact, for Edison calls occasionally for their use\r\nin some of his later experiments, and there is a suspicion among the\r\nlaboratory staff that some day he may resume work on incandescent lamps.\r\nAdjacent to these rooms are several others devoted to physical and\r\nmechanical experiments, together with a draughting-room.\r\n\r\nLast to be mentioned, but the first in order as one leaves the head of\r\nthe stairs leading up to this floor, is No. 12, Edison's favorite room,\r\nwhere he will frequently be found. Plain of aspect, being merely a space\r\nboarded off with tongued-and-grooved planks--as all the other rooms\r\nare--without ornament or floor covering, and containing only a few\r\narticles of cheap furniture, this room seems to exercise a nameless\r\ncharm for him. The door is always open, and often he can be seen seated\r\nat a plain table in the centre of the room, deeply intent on some of the\r\nnumerous problems in which he is interested. The table is usually pretty\r\nwell filled with specimens or data of experimental results which have\r\nbeen put there for his examination. At the time of this writing these\r\nspecimens consist largely of sections of positive elements of the\r\nstorage battery, together with many samples of nickel hydrate, to which\r\nEdison devotes deep study. Close at hand is a microscope which is\r\nin frequent use by him in these investigations. Around the room, on\r\nshelves, are hundreds of bottles each containing a small quantity\r\nof nickel hydrate made in as many different ways, each labelled\r\ncorrespondingly. Always at hand will be found one or two of the\r\nlaboratory note-books, with frequent entries or comments in the\r\nhandwriting which once seen is never forgotten.\r\n\r\nNo. 12 is at times a chemical, a physical, or a mechanical\r\nroom--occasionally a combination of all, while sometimes it might be\r\ncalled a consultation-room or clinic--for often Edison may be seen there\r\nin animated conference with a group of his assistants; but its chief\r\ndistinction lies in its being one of his favorite haunts, and in the\r\nfact that within its walls have been settled many of the perplexing\r\nproblems and momentous questions that have brought about great changes\r\nin electrical and engineering arts during the twenty-odd years that have\r\nelapsed since the Orange laboratory was built.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the top floor the visitor finds himself at the head of a\r\nbroad hall running almost the entire length of the building, and\r\nlined mostly with glass-fronted cabinets containing a multitude of\r\nexperimental incandescent lamps and an immense variety of models of\r\nphonographs, motors, telegraph and telephone apparatus, meters, and a\r\nhost of other inventions upon which Edison's energies have at one time\r\nand another been bent. Here also are other cabinets containing old\r\npapers and records, while further along the wall are piled up boxes\r\nof historical models and instruments. In fact, this hallway, with its\r\nconglomerate contents, may well be considered a scientific attic. It is\r\nto be hoped that at no distant day these Edisoniana will be assembled\r\nand arranged in a fireproof museum for the benefit of posterity.\r\n\r\nIn the front end of the building, and extending over the library, is\r\na large room intended originally and used for a time as the phonograph\r\nmusic-hall for record-making, but now used only as an experimental-room\r\nfor phonograph work, as the growth of the industry has necessitated a\r\nvery much larger and more central place where records can be made on a\r\ncommercial scale. Even the experimental work imposes no slight burden on\r\nit. On each side of the hallway above mentioned, rooms are partitioned\r\noff and used for experimental work of various kinds, mostly\r\nphonographic, although on this floor are also located the\r\nstorage-battery testing-room, a chemical and physical room and Edison's\r\nprivate office, where all his personal correspondence and business\r\naffairs are conducted by his personal secretary, Mr. H. F. Miller. A\r\nvisitor to this upper floor of the laboratory building cannot but be\r\nimpressed with a consciousness of the incessant efforts that are being\r\nmade to improve the reproducing qualities of the phonograph, as he hears\r\nfrom all sides the sounds of vocal and instrumental music constantly\r\nvarying in volume and timbre, due to changes in the experimental devices\r\nunder trial.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the laboratory include cots placed in many of the\r\nrooms of these upper floors, but that was in the earlier years when the\r\nstrenuous scenes of Menlo Park were repeated in the new quarters. Edison\r\nand his closest associates were accustomed to carry their labors far\r\ninto the wee sma' hours, and when physical nature demanded a respite\r\nfrom work, a short rest would be obtained by going to bed on a cot.\r\nOne would naturally think that the wear and tear of this intense\r\napplication, day after day and night after night, would have tended to\r\ninduce a heaviness and gravity of demeanor in these busy men; but on\r\nthe contrary, the old spirit of good-humor and prankishness was ever\r\npresent, as its frequent outbursts manifested from time to time. One\r\ninstance will serve as an illustration. One morning, about 2.30, the\r\nlate Charles Batchelor announced that he was tired and would go to bed.\r\nLeaving Edison and the others busily working, he went out and returned\r\nquietly in slippered feet, with his nightgown on, the handle of a\r\nfeather duster stuck down his back with the feathers waving over his\r\nhead, and his face marked. With unearthly howls and shrieks, a l'Indien,\r\nhe pranced about the room, incidentally giving Edison a scare that made\r\nhim jump up from his work. He saw the joke quickly, however, and joined\r\nin the general merriment caused by this prank.\r\n\r\nLeaving the main building with its corps of busy experimenters, and\r\ncoming out into the spacious yard, one notes the four long single-story\r\nbrick structures mentioned above. The one nearest the Valley Road is\r\ncalled the galvanometer-room, and was originally intended by Edison to\r\nbe used for the most delicate and minute electrical measurements. In\r\norder to provide rigid resting-places for the numerous and elaborate\r\ninstruments he had purchased for this purpose, the building was equipped\r\nalong three-quarters of its length with solid pillars, or tables, of\r\nbrick set deep in the earth. These were built up to a height of about\r\ntwo and a half feet, and each was surmounted with a single heavy slab of\r\nblack marble. A cement floor was laid, and every precaution was taken to\r\nrender the building free from all magnetic influences, so that it would\r\nbe suitable for electrical work of the utmost accuracy and precision.\r\nHence, iron and steel were entirely eliminated in its construction,\r\ncopper being used for fixtures for steam and water piping, and, indeed,\r\nfor all other purposes where metal was employed.\r\n\r\nThis room was for many years the headquarters of Edison's able\r\nassistant, Dr. A. E. Kennelly, now professor of electrical engineering\r\nin Harvard University to whose energetic and capable management were\r\nintrusted many scientific investigations during his long sojourn at\r\nthe laboratory. Unfortunately, however, for the continued success of\r\nEdison's elaborate plans, he had not been many years established in the\r\nlaboratory before a trolley road through West Orange was projected and\r\nbuilt, the line passing in front of the plant and within seventy-five\r\nfeet of the galvanometer-room, thus making it practically impossible to\r\nuse it for the delicate purposes for which it was originally intended.\r\n\r\nFor some time past it has been used for photography and some special\r\nexperiments on motion pictures as well as for demonstrations connected\r\nwith physical research; but some reminders of its old-time glory still\r\nremain in evidence. In lofty and capacious glass-enclosed cabinets, in\r\ncompany with numerous models of Edison's inventions, repose many of\r\nthe costly and elaborate instruments rendered useless by the ubiquitous\r\ntrolley. Instruments are all about, on walls, tables, and shelves, the\r\nphotometer is covered up; induction coils of various capacities,\r\nwith other electrical paraphernalia, lie around, almost as if the\r\nexperimenter were absent for a few days but would soon return and resume\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nIn numbering the group of buildings, the galvanometer-room is No. 1,\r\nwhile the other single-story structures are numbered respectively 2, 3,\r\nand 4. On passing out of No. 1 and proceeding to the succeeding building\r\nis noticed, between the two, a garage of ample dimensions and a smaller\r\nstructure, at the door of which stands a concrete-mixer. In this small\r\nbuilding Edison has made some of his most important experiments in the\r\nprocess of working out his plans for the poured house. It is in this\r\nlittle place that there was developed the remarkable mixture which is to\r\nplay so vital a part in the successful construction of these everlasting\r\nhomes for living millions.\r\n\r\nDrawing near to building No. 2, olfactory evidence presents itself of\r\nthe immediate vicinity of a chemical laboratory. This is confirmed as\r\none enters the door and finds that the entire building is devoted to\r\nchemistry. Long rows of shelves and cabinets filled with chemicals line\r\nthe room; a profusion of retorts, alembics, filters, and other chemical\r\napparatus on numerous tables and stands, greet the eye, while a corps\r\nof experimenters may be seen busy in the preparation of various\r\ncombinations, some of which are boiling or otherwise cooking under their\r\ndexterous manipulation.\r\n\r\nIt would not require many visits to discover that in this room, also,\r\nEdison has a favorite nook. Down at the far end in a corner are a plain\r\nlittle table and chair, and here he is often to be found deeply immersed\r\nin a study of the many experiments that are being conducted. Not\r\ninfrequently he is actively engaged in the manipulation of some compound\r\nof special intricacy, whose results might be illuminative of obscure\r\nfacts not patent to others than himself. Here, too, is a select little\r\nlibrary of chemical literature.\r\n\r\nThe next building, No. 3, has a double mission--the farther half being\r\npartitioned off for a pattern-making shop, while the other half is used\r\nas a store-room for chemicals in quantity and for chemical apparatus\r\nand utensils. A grimly humorous incident, as related by one of the\r\nlaboratory staff, attaches to No. 3. It seems that some time ago one of\r\nthe helpers in the chemical department, an excitable foreigner,\r\nbecame dissatisfied with his wages, and after making an unsuccessful\r\napplication for an increase, rushed in desperation to Edison, and said\r\n\"Eef I not get more money I go to take ze cyanide potassia.\" Edison gave\r\nhim one quick, searching glance and, detecting a bluff, replied in an\r\noffhand manner: \"There's a five-pound bottle in No. 3,\" and turned to\r\nhis work again. The foreigner did not go to get the cyanide, but gave up\r\nhis job.\r\n\r\nThe last of these original buildings, No. 4, was used for many years\r\nin Edison's ore-concentrating experiments, and also for rough-and-ready\r\noperations of other kinds, such as furnace work and the like. At the\r\npresent writing it is used as a general stock-room.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing details, the reader has been afforded but a passing\r\nglance at the great practical working equipment which constitutes the\r\ntheatre of Edison's activities, for, in taking a general view of such a\r\nunique and comprehensive laboratory plant, its salient features only can\r\nbe touched upon to advantage. It would be but repetition to enumerate\r\nhere the practical results of the laboratory work during the past two\r\ndecades, as they appear on other pages of this work. Nor can one assume\r\nfor a moment that the history of Edison's laboratory is a closed book.\r\nOn the contrary, its territorial boundaries have been increasing step by\r\nstep with the enlargement of its labors, until now it has been obliged\r\nto go outside its own proper domains to occupy some space in and about\r\nthe great Edison industrial buildings and space immediately adjacent. It\r\nmust be borne in mind that the laboratory is only the core of a group of\r\nbuildings devoted to production on a huge scale by hundreds of artisans.\r\n\r\nIncidental mention has already been made of the laboratory at Edison's\r\nwinter residence in Florida, where he goes annually to spend a month or\r\nsix weeks. This is a miniature copy of the Orange laboratory, with its\r\nmachine shop, chemical-room, and general experimental department. While\r\nit is only in use during his sojourn there, and carries no extensive\r\ncorps of assistants, the work done in it is not of a perfunctory nature,\r\nbut is a continuation of his regular activities, and serves to keep him\r\nin touch with the progress of experiments at Orange, and enables him to\r\ngive instructions for their variation and continuance as their scope\r\nis expanded by his own investigations made while enjoying what he calls\r\n\"vacation.\" What Edison in Florida speaks of as \"loafing\" would be for\r\nmost of us extreme and healthy activity in the cooler Far North.\r\n\r\nA word or two may be devoted to the visitors received at the laboratory,\r\nand to the correspondence. It might be injudicious to gauge the\r\ngreatness of a man by the number of his callers or his letters; but\r\nthey are at least an indication of the degree to which he interests\r\nthe world. In both respects, for these forty years, Edison has been a\r\nstriking example of the manner in which the sentiment of hero-worship\r\ncan manifest itself, and of the deep desire of curiosity to get\r\nsatisfaction by personal observation or contact. Edison's mail, like\r\nthat of most well-known men, is extremely large, but composed in no\r\nsmall degree of letters--thousands of them yearly--that concern only the\r\nwriters, and might well go to the waste-paper basket without prolonged\r\nconsideration. The serious and important part of the mail, some personal\r\nand some business, occupies the attention of several men; all such\r\nletters finding their way promptly into the proper channels, often with\r\na pithy endorsement by Edison scribbled on the margin. What to do with\r\na host of others it is often difficult to decide, even when written by\r\n\"cranks,\" who imagine themselves subject to strange electrical ailments\r\nfrom which Edison alone can relieve them. Many people write asking his\r\nopinion as to a certain invention, or offering him an interest in it\r\nif he will work it out. Other people abroad ask help in locating lost\r\nrelatives; and many want advice as to what they shall do with their\r\nsons, frequently budding geniuses whose ability to wire a bell has\r\ndemonstrated unusual qualities. A great many persons want autographs,\r\nand some would like photographs. The amazing thing about it all is\r\nthat this flood of miscellaneous letters flows on in one steady,\r\nuninterrupted stream, year in and year out; always a curious\r\npsychological study in its variety and volume; and ever a proof of the\r\nfact that once a man has become established as a personality in the\r\npublic eye and mind, nothing can stop the tide of correspondence that\r\nwill deluge him.\r\n\r\nIt is generally, in the nature of things, easier to write a letter than\r\nto make a call; and the semi-retirement of Edison at a distance of\r\nan hour by train from New York stands as a means of protection to him\r\nagainst those who would certainly present their respects in person, if\r\nhe could be got at without trouble. But it may be seriously questioned\r\nwhether in the aggregate Edison's visitors are less numerous or\r\nless time-consuming than his epistolary besiegers. It is the common\r\nexperience of any visitor to the laboratory that there are usually\r\nseveral persons ahead of him, no matter what the hour of the day, and\r\nsome whose business has been sufficiently vital to get them inside\r\nthe porter's gate, or even into the big library and lounging-room.\r\nCelebrities of all kinds and distinguished foreigners are\r\nnumerous--princes, noblemen, ambassadors, artists, litterateurs,\r\nscientists, financiers, women. A very large part of the visiting is done\r\nby scientific bodies and societies; and then the whole place will be\r\nturned over to hundreds of eager, well-dressed men and women, anxious\r\nto see everything and to be photographed in the big courtyard around\r\nthe central hero. Nor are these groups and delegations limited to this\r\ncountry, for even large parties of English, Dutch, Italian, or Japanese\r\nvisitors come from time to time, and are greeted with the same ready\r\nhospitality, although Edison, it is easy to see, is torn between the\r\nconflicting emotions of a desire to be courteous, and an anxiety to\r\nguard the precious hours of work, or watch the critical stage of a new\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nOne distinct group of visitors has always been constituted by the\r\n\"newspaper men.\" Hardly a day goes by that the journals do not contain\r\nsome reference to Edison's work or remarks; and the items are generally\r\nbased on an interview. The reporters are never away from the laboratory\r\nvery long; for if they have no actual mission of inquiry, there is\r\nalways the chance of a good story being secured offhand; and the easy,\r\ninveterate good-nature of Edison toward reporters is proverbial in\r\nthe craft. Indeed, it must be stated here that once in a while this\r\nconfidence has been abused; that stories have been published utterly\r\nwithout foundation; that interviews have been printed which never took\r\nplace; that articles with Edison's name as author have been widely\r\ncirculated, although he never saw them; and that in such ways he has\r\nsuffered directly. But such occasional incidents tend in no wise to\r\nlessen Edison's warm admiration of the press or his readiness to avail\r\nhimself of it whenever a representative goes over to Orange to get the\r\ntruth or the real facts in regard to any matter of public importance. As\r\nfor the newspaper clippings containing such articles, or others in which\r\nEdison's name appears--they are literally like sands of the sea-shore\r\nfor number; and the archives of the laboratory that preserve only a very\r\nminute percentage of them are a further demonstration of what publicity\r\nmeans, where a figure like Edison is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nEDISON IN COMMERCE AND MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\nAN applicant for membership in the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia is\r\nrequired to give a brief statement of the professional work he has\r\ndone. Some years ago a certain application was made, and contained the\r\nfollowing terse and modest sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have designed a concentrating plant and built a machine shop, etc.,\r\netc. THOMAS A. EDISON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in the foregoing pages the reader has been made acquainted\r\nwith the tremendous import of the actualities lying behind those \"etc.,\r\netc.,\" the narrative up to this point has revealed Edison chiefly in the\r\nlight of inventor, experimenter, and investigator. There have been\r\nsome side glimpses of the industries he has set on foot, and of their\r\nfinancial aspects, and a later chapter will endeavor to sum up the\r\nintrinsic value of Edison's work to the world. But there are some other\r\ninteresting points that may be touched on now in regard to a few of\r\nEdison's financial and commercial ventures not generally known or\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular idea founded on experience that an inventor is not\r\nusually a business man. One of the exceptions proving the rule may\r\nperhaps be met in Edison, though all depends on the point of view. All\r\nhis life he has had a great deal to do with finance and commerce, and\r\nas one looks at the magnitude of the vast industries he has helped to\r\ncreate, it would not be at all unreasonable to expect him to be among\r\nthe multi-millionaires. That he is not is due to the absence of certain\r\nqualities, the lack of which Edison is himself the first to admit.\r\nThose qualities may not be amiable, but great wealth is hardly ever\r\naccumulated without them. If he had not been so intent on inventing he\r\nwould have made more of his great opportunities for getting rich. If\r\nthis utter detachment from any love of money for its own sake has not\r\nalready been illustrated in some of the incidents narrated, one or two\r\nstories are available to emphasize the point. They do not involve any\r\nwant of the higher business acumen that goes to the proper conduct of\r\naffairs. It was said of Gladstone that he was the greatest Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer England ever saw, but that as a retail merchant he would\r\nsoon have ruined himself by his bookkeeping.\r\n\r\nEdison confesses that he has never made a cent out of his patents in\r\nelectric light and power--in fact, that they have been an expense\r\nto him, and thus a free gift to the world. [18] This was true of the\r\nEuropean patents as well as the American. \"I endeavored to sell my\r\nlighting patents in different countries of Europe, and made a contract\r\nwith a couple of men. On account of their poor business capacity and\r\nlack of practicality, they conveyed under the patents all rights to\r\ndifferent corporations but in such a way and with such confused wording\r\nof the contracts that I never got a cent. One of the companies\r\nstarted was the German Edison, now the great Allgemeine Elektricitaets\r\nGesellschaft. The English company I never got anything for, because a\r\nlawyer had originally advised Drexel, Morgan & Co. as to the signing of\r\na certain document, and said it was all right for me to sign. I signed,\r\nand I never got a cent because there was a clause in it which prevented\r\nme from ever getting anything.\" A certain easy-going belief in human\r\nnature, and even a certain carelessness of attitude toward business\r\naffairs, are here revealed. We have already pointed out two instances\r\nwhere in his dealings with the Western Union Company he stipulated that\r\npayments of $6000 per year for seventeen years were to be made instead\r\nof $100,000 in cash, evidently forgetful of the fact that the annual sum\r\nso received was nothing more than legal interest, which could have been\r\nearned indefinitely if the capital had been only insisted upon. In later\r\nlife Edison has been more circumspect, but throughout his early career\r\nhe was constantly getting into some kind of scrape. Of one experience he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 18: Edison received some stock from the parent\r\n     lighting company, but as the capital stock of that company\r\n     was increased from time to time, his proportion grew\r\n     smaller, and he ultimately used it to obtain ready money\r\n     with which to create and finance the various \"shops\" in\r\n     which were manufactured the various items of electric-\r\n     lighting apparatus necessary to exploit his system. Besides,\r\n     he was obliged to raise additional large sums of money from\r\n     other sources for this purpose. He thus became a\r\n     manufacturer with capital raised by himself, and the stock\r\n     that he received later, on the formation of the General\r\n     Electric Company, was not for his electric-light patents,\r\n     but was in payment for his manufacturing establishments,\r\n     which had then grown to be of great commercial importance.]\r\n\r\n\"In the early days I was experimenting with metallic filaments for the\r\nincandescent light, and sent a certain man out to California in search\r\nof platinum. He found a considerable quantity in the sluice-boxes of\r\nthe Cherokee Valley Mining Company; but just then he found also that\r\nfruit-gardening was the thing, and dropped the subject. He then came to\r\nme and said that if he could raise $4000 he could go into some kind of\r\norchard arrangement out there, and would give me half the profits. I\r\nwas unwilling to do it, not having very much money just then, but his\r\npersistence was such that I raised the money and gave it to him. He went\r\nback to California, and got into mining claims and into fruit-growing,\r\nand became one of the politicians of the Coast, and, I believe, was on\r\nthe staff of the Governor of the State. A couple of years ago he wounded\r\nhis daughter and shot himself because he had become ruined financially.\r\nI never heard from him after he got the money.\"\r\n\r\nEdison tells of another similar episode. \"I had two men working for\r\nme--one a German, the other a Jew. They wanted me to put up a little\r\nmoney and start them in a shop in New York to make repairs, etc. I\r\nput up $800, and was to get half of the profits, and each of them\r\none-quarter. I never got anything for it. A few years afterward I went\r\nto see them, and asked what they were doing, and said I would like\r\nto sell my interest. They said: 'Sell out what?' 'Why,' I said, 'my\r\ninterest in the machinery.' They said: 'You don't own this machinery.\r\nThis is our machinery. You have no papers to show anything. You had\r\nbetter get out.' I am inclined to think that the percentage of crooked\r\npeople was smaller when I was young. It has been steadily rising, and\r\nhas got up to a very respectable figure now. I hope it will never reach\r\npar.\" To which lugubrious episode so provocative of cynicism, Edison\r\nadds: \"When I was a young fellow the first thing I did when I went to\r\na town was to put something into the savings-bank and start an account.\r\nWhen I came to New York I put $30 into a savings-bank under the New York\r\nSun office. After the money had been in about two weeks the bank busted.\r\nThat was in 1870. In 1909 I got back $6.40, with a charge for $1.75 for\r\nlaw expenses. That shows the beauty of New York receiverships.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be wondered at that Edison is rather frank and unsparing\r\nin some of his criticisms of shady modern business methods, and the\r\nmention of the following incident always provokes him to a fine scorn.\r\n\"I had an interview with one of the wealthiest men in New York. He\r\nwanted me to sell out my associates in the electric lighting business,\r\nand offered me all I was going to get and $100,000 besides. Of course I\r\nwould not do it. I found out that the reason for this offer was that he\r\nhad had trouble with Mr. Morgan, and wanted to get even with him.\" Wall\r\nStreet is, in fact, a frequent object of rather sarcastic reference,\r\napplying even to its regular and probably correct methods of banking.\r\n\"When I was running my ore-mine,\" he says, \"and got up to the point of\r\nmaking shipments to John Fritz, I didn't have capital enough to carry\r\nthe ore, so I went to J. P. Morgan & Co. and said I wanted them to give\r\nme a letter to the City Bank. I wanted to raise some money. I got a\r\nletter to Mr. Stillman; and went over and told him I wanted to open an\r\naccount and get some loans and discounts. He turned me down, and would\r\nnot do it. 'Well,' I said, 'isn't it banking to help a man in this way?'\r\nHe said: 'What you want is a partner.' I felt very much crestfallen.\r\nI went over to a bank in Newark--the Merchants'--and told them what\r\nI wanted. They said: 'Certainly, you can have the money.' I made my\r\ndeposit, and they pulled me through all right. My idea of Wall Street\r\nbanking has been very poor since that time. Merchant banking seems to be\r\ndifferent.\"\r\n\r\nAs a general thing, Edison has had no trouble in raising money when he\r\nneeded it, the reason being that people have faith in him as soon\r\nas they come to know him. A little incident bears on this point. \"In\r\noperating the Schenectady works Mr. Insull and I had a terrible burden.\r\nWe had enormous orders and little money, and had great difficulty to\r\nmeet our payrolls and buy supplies. At one time we had so many orders on\r\nhand we wanted $200,000 worth of copper, and didn't have a cent to buy\r\nit. We went down to the Ansonia Brass and Copper Company, and told Mr.\r\nCowles just how we stood. He said: 'I will see what I can do. Will you\r\nlet my bookkeeper look at your books?' We said: 'Come right up and look\r\nthem over.' He sent his man up and found we had the orders and were all\r\nright, although we didn't have the money. He said: 'I will let you have\r\nthe copper.' And for years he trusted us for all the copper we wanted,\r\neven if we didn't have the money to pay for it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that Edison, in addition to being a newsboy\r\nand a contributor to the technical press, has also been a backer and\r\nan \"angel\" for various publications. This is perhaps the right place at\r\nwhich to refer to the matter, as it belongs in the list of his financial\r\nor commercial enterprises. Edison sums up this chapter of his life very\r\npithily. \"I was interested, as a telegrapher, in journalism, and started\r\nthe Telegraph Journal, and got out about a dozen numbers when it was\r\ntaken over by W. J. Johnston, who afterward founded the Electrical World\r\non it as an offshoot from the Operator. I also started Science, and ran\r\nit for a year and a half. It cost me too much money to maintain, and I\r\nsold it to Gardiner Hubbard, the father-in-law of Alexander Graham\r\nBell. He carried it along for years.\" Both these papers are still\r\nin prosperous existence, particularly the Electrical World, as the\r\nrecognized exponent of electrical development in America, where now\r\nthe public spends as much annually for electricity as it does for daily\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said above it will be understood that Edison's\r\nreal and remarkable capacity for business does not lie in ability to\r\n\"take care of himself,\" nor in the direction of routine office practice,\r\nnor even in ordinary administrative affairs. In short, he would and does\r\nregard it as a foolish waste of his time to give attention to the mere\r\noccupancy of a desk.\r\n\r\nHis commercial strength manifests itself rather in the outlining of\r\nmatters relating to organization and broad policy with a sagacity\r\narising from a shrewd perception and appreciation of general business\r\nrequirements and conditions, to which should be added his intensely\r\ncomprehensive grasp of manufacturing possibilities and details, and\r\nan unceasing vigilance in devising means of improving the quality of\r\nproducts and increasing the economy of their manufacture.\r\n\r\nLike other successful commanders, Edison also possesses the happy\r\nfaculty of choosing suitable lieutenants to carry out his policies and\r\nto manage the industries he has created, such, for instance, as those\r\nwith which this chapter has to deal--namely, the phonograph, motion\r\npicture, primary battery, and storage battery enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe Portland cement business has already been dealt with separately, and\r\nalthough the above remarks are appropriate to it also, Edison being\r\nits head and informing spirit, the following pages are intended to be\r\ndevoted to those industries that are grouped around the laboratory at\r\nOrange, and that may be taken as typical of Edison's methods on the\r\nmanufacturing side.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months after establishing himself at the present\r\nlaboratory, in 1887, Edison entered upon one of those intensely active\r\nperiods of work that have been so characteristic of his methods in\r\ncommercializing his other inventions. In this case his labors were\r\ndirected toward improving the phonograph so as to put it into thoroughly\r\npracticable form, capable of ordinary use by the public at large. The\r\nnet result of this work was the general type of machine of which the\r\nwell-known phonograph of today is a refinement evolved through many\r\nyears of sustained experiment and improvement.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable period of strenuous activity in the eighties, the\r\nphonograph and its wax records were developed to a sufficient degree of\r\nperfection to warrant him in making arrangements for their manufacture\r\nand commercial introduction. At this time the surroundings of the Orange\r\nlaboratory were distinctly rural in character. Immediately adjacent\r\nto the main building and the four smaller structures, constituting\r\nthe laboratory plant, were grass meadows that stretched away for some\r\nconsiderable distance in all directions, and at its back door, so to\r\nspeak, ducks paddled around and quacked in a pond undisturbed. Being now\r\nready for manufacturing, but requiring more facilities, Edison increased\r\nhis real-estate holdings by purchasing a large tract of land lying\r\ncontiguous to what he already owned. At one end of the newly acquired\r\nland two unpretentious brick structures were erected, equipped\r\nwith first-class machinery, and put into commission as shops for\r\nmanufacturing phonographs and their record blanks; while the capacious\r\nhall forming the third story of the laboratory, over the library, was\r\nfitted up and used as a music-room where records were made.\r\n\r\nThus the modern Edison phonograph made its modest debut in 1888, in what\r\nwas then called the \"Improved\" form to distinguish it from the original\r\nstyle of machine he invented in 1877, in which the record was made on a\r\nsheet of tin-foil held in place upon a metallic cylinder. The \"Improved\"\r\nform is the general type so well known for many years and sold at the\r\npresent day--viz., the spring or electric motor-driven machine with the\r\ncylindrical wax record--in fact, the regulation Edison phonograph.\r\n\r\nIt did not take a long time to find a market for the products of the\r\nnewly established factory, for a world-wide public interest in the\r\nmachine had been created by the appearance of newspaper articles from\r\ntime to time, announcing the approaching completion by Edison of his\r\nimproved phonograph. The original (tin-foil) machine had been sufficient\r\nto illustrate the fact that the human voice and other sounds could\r\nbe recorded and reproduced, but such a type of machine had sharp\r\nlimitations in general use; hence the coming into being of a type that\r\nany ordinary person could handle was sufficient of itself to insure a\r\nmarket. Thus the demand for the new machines and wax records grew apace\r\nas the corporations organized to handle the business extended their\r\nlines. An examination of the newspaper files of the years 1888, 1889,\r\nand 1890 will reveal the great excitement caused by the bringing out of\r\nthe new phonograph, and how frequently and successfully it was employed\r\nin public entertainments, either for the whole or part of an evening.\r\nIn this and other ways it became popularized to a still further extent.\r\nThis led to the demand for a nickel-in-the-slot machine, which, when\r\nestablished, became immensely popular over the whole country. In its\r\nearlier forms the \"Improved\" phonograph was not capable of such\r\ngeneral non-expert handling as is the machine of the present day, and\r\nconsequently there was a constant endeavor on Edison's part to\r\nsimplify the construction of the machine and its manner of operation.\r\nExperimentation was incessantly going on with this in view, and in the\r\nprocesses of evolution changes were made here and there that resulted in\r\na still greater measure of perfection.\r\n\r\nIn various ways there was a continual slow and steady growth of the\r\nindustry thus created, necessitating the erection of many additional\r\nbuildings as the years passed by. During part of the last decade there\r\nwas a lull, caused mostly from the failure of corporate interests to\r\ncarry out their contract relations with Edison, and he was thereby\r\ncompelled to resort to legal proceedings, at the end of which he\r\nbought in the outstanding contracts and assumed command of the business\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\nBeing thus freed from many irksome restrictions that had hung heavily\r\nupon him, Edison now proceeded to push the phonograph business under a\r\nbroader policy than that which obtained under his previous contractual\r\nrelations. With the ever-increasing simplification and efficiency of the\r\nmachine and a broadening of its application, the results of this policy\r\nwere manifested in a still more rapid growth of the business that\r\nnecessitated further additions to the manufacturing plant. And thus\r\nmatters went on until the early part of the present decade, when the\r\nfactory facilities were becoming so rapidly outgrown as to render\r\nradical changes necessary. It was in these circumstances that Edison's\r\nsagacity and breadth of business capacity came to the front. With\r\ncharacteristic boldness and foresight he planned the erection of the\r\nseries of magnificent concrete buildings that now stand adjacent to\r\nand around the laboratory, and in which the manufacturing plant is at\r\npresent housed.\r\n\r\nThere was no narrowness in his views in designing these buildings, but,\r\non the contrary, great faith in the future, for his plans included\r\nnot only the phonograph industry, but provided also for the coming\r\ndevelopment of motion pictures and of the primary and storage battery\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nIn the aggregate there are twelve structures (including the\r\nadministration building), of which six are of imposing dimensions,\r\nrunning from 200 feet long by 50 feet wide to 440 feet in length by\r\n115 feet in width, all these larger buildings, except one, being five\r\nstories in height. They are constructed entirely of reinforced concrete\r\nwith Edison cement, including walls, floors, and stairways, thus\r\neliminating fire hazard to the utmost extent, and insuring a high degree\r\nof protection, cleanliness, and sanitation. As fully three-fourths of\r\nthe area of their exterior framework consists of windows, an abundance\r\nof daylight is secured. These many advantages, combined with lofty\r\nceilings on every floor, provide ideal conditions for the thousands of\r\nworking people engaged in this immense plant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these twelve concrete structures there are a few smaller\r\nbrick and wooden buildings on the grounds, in which some special\r\noperations are conducted. These, however, are few in number, and at\r\nsome future time will be concentrated in one or more additional concrete\r\nbuildings. It will afford a clearer idea of the extent of the industries\r\nclustered immediately around the laboratory when it is stated that the\r\ncombined floor space which is occupied by them in all these buildings is\r\nequivalent in the aggregate to over fourteen acres.\r\n\r\nIt would be instructive, but scarcely within the scope of the narrative,\r\nto conduct the reader through this extensive plant and see its many\r\ninteresting operations in detail. It must suffice, however, to note\r\nits complete and ample equipment with modern machinery of every kind\r\napplicable to the work; its numerous (and some of them wonderfully\r\ningenious) methods, processes, machines, and tools specially designed\r\nor invented for the manufacture of special parts and supplemental\r\nappliances for the phonograph or other Edison products; and also to\r\nnote the interesting variety of trades represented in the different\r\ndepartments, in which are included chemists, electricians, electrical\r\nmechanicians, machinists, mechanics, pattern-makers, carpenters,\r\ncabinet-makers, varnishers, japanners, tool-makers, lapidaries,\r\nwax experts, photographic developers and printers, opticians,\r\nelectroplaters, furnacemen, and others, together with factory\r\nexperimenters and a host of general employees, who by careful training\r\nhave become specialists and experts in numerous branches of these\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nEdison's plans for this manufacturing plant were sufficiently well\r\noutlined to provide ample capacity for the natural growth of the\r\nbusiness; and although that capacity (so far as phonographs is\r\nconcerned) has actually reached an output of over 6000 complete\r\nphonographs PER WEEK, and upward of 130,000 molded records PER DAY--with\r\na pay-roll embracing over 3500 employees, including office force--and\r\namounting to about $45,000 per week--the limits of production have not\r\nyet been reached.\r\n\r\nThe constant outpouring of products in such large quantities bespeaks\r\nthe unremitting activities of an extensive and busy selling organization\r\nto provide for their marketing and distribution. This important\r\ndepartment (the National Phonograph Company), in all its branches, from\r\npresident to office-boy, includes about two hundred employees on its\r\noffice pay-roll, and makes its headquarters in the administration\r\nbuilding, which is one of the large concrete structures above referred\r\nto. The policy of the company is to dispose of its wares through regular\r\ntrade channels rather than to deal direct with the public, trusting\r\nto local activity as stimulated by a liberal policy of national\r\nadvertising. Thus, there has been gradually built up a very extensive\r\nbusiness until at the present time an enormous output of phonographs\r\nand records is distributed to retail customers in the United States and\r\nCanada through the medium of about one hundred and fifty jobbers and\r\nover thirteen thousand dealers. The Edison phonograph industry thus\r\norganized is helped by frequent conventions of this large commercial\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the National Phonograph Company maintains a special staff\r\nfor carrying on the business with foreign countries. While the aggregate\r\ntransactions of this department are not as extensive as those for\r\nthe United States and Canada, they are of considerable volume, as the\r\nforeign office distributes in bulk a very large number of phonographs\r\nand records to selling companies and agencies in Europe, Asia,\r\nAustralia, Japan, and, indeed, to all the countries of the civilized\r\nworld. [19] Like England's drumbeat, the voice of the Edison phonograph\r\nis heard around the world in undying strains throughout the twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 19: It may be of interest to the reader to note\r\n     some parts of the globe to which shipments of phonographs\r\n     and records are made:\r\n\r\n     Samoan Islands Falkland Islands Siam Corea Crete Island\r\n     Paraguay Chile Canary Islands Egypt British East Africa Cape\r\n     Colony Portuguese East Africa Liberia Java Straits\r\n     Settlements Madagascar Fanning Islands New Zealand French\r\n     Indo-China Morocco Ecuador Brazil Madeira South Africa\r\n     Azores Manchuria Ceylon Sierra Leone]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the main manufacturing plant at Orange, another important\r\nadjunct must not be forgotten, and that is, the Recording Department\r\nin New York City, where the master records are made under the\r\nsuperintendence of experts who have studied the intricacies of the art\r\nwith Edison himself. This department occupies an upper story in a lofty\r\nbuilding, and in its various rooms may be seen and heard many prominent\r\nmusicians, vocalists, speakers, and vaudeville artists studiously and\r\nbusily engaged in making the original records, which are afterward sent\r\nto Orange, and which, if approved by the expert committee, are passed on\r\nto the proper department for reproduction in large quantities.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the subject of motion pictures we find a similarity in\r\ngeneral business methods, for while the projecting machines and copies\r\nof picture films are made in quantity at the Orange works (just as\r\nphonographs and duplicate records are so made), the original picture,\r\nor film, like the master record, is made elsewhere. There is this\r\ndifference, however: that, from the particular nature of the work,\r\npractically ALL master records are made at one convenient place, while\r\nthe essential interest in SOME motion pictures lies in the fact that\r\nthey are taken in various parts of the world, often under exceptional\r\ncircumstances. The \"silent drama,\" however, calls also for many\r\nrepresentations which employ conventional acting, staging, and the\r\nvaried appliances of stagecraft. Hence, Edison saw early the necessity\r\nof providing a place especially devised and arranged for the production\r\nof dramatic performances in pantomime.\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry from the crude structure of early days--the \"Black\r\nMaria\" of 1891, swung around on its pivot in the Orange laboratory\r\nyard--to the well-appointed Edison theatres, or pantomime studios, in\r\nNew York City. The largest of these is located in the suburban Borough\r\nof the Bronx, and consists of a three-story-and-basement building of\r\nreinforced concrete, in which are the offices, dressing-rooms, wardrobe\r\nand property-rooms, library and developing department. Contiguous to\r\nthis building, and connected with it, is the theatre proper, a large and\r\nlofty structure whose sides and roof are of glass, and whose floor space\r\nis sufficiently ample for six different sets of scenery at one time,\r\nwith plenty of room left for a profusion of accessories, such as tables,\r\nchairs, pianos, bunch-lights, search-lights, cameras, and a host of\r\nvaried paraphernalia pertaining to stage effects.\r\n\r\nThe second Edison theatre, or studio, is located not far from the\r\nshopping district in New York City. In all essential features, except\r\nsize and capacity, it is a duplicate of the one in the Bronx, of which\r\nit is a supplement.\r\n\r\nTo a visitor coming on the floor of such a theatre for the first time\r\nthere is a sense of confusion in beholding the heterogeneous \"sets\"\r\nof scenery and the motley assemblage of characters represented in the\r\nvarious plays in the process of \"taking,\" or rehearsal. While each set\r\nconstitutes virtually a separate stage, they are all on the same floor,\r\nwithout wings or proscenium-arches, and separated only by a few feet.\r\nThus, for instance, a Japanese house interior may be seen cheek by jowl\r\nwith an ordinary prison cell, flanked by a mining-camp, which in turn\r\nstands next to a drawing-room set, and in each a set of appropriate\r\ncharacters in pantomimic motion. The action is incessant, for in any\r\ndramatic representation intended for the motion-picture film every\r\nsecond counts.\r\n\r\nThe production of several completed plays per week necessitates the\r\nemployment of a considerable staff of people of miscellaneous trades and\r\nabilities. At each of these two studios there is employed a number\r\nof stage-directors, scene-painters, carpenters, property-men,\r\nphotographers, costumers, electricians, clerks, and general assistants,\r\nbesides a capable stock company of actors and actresses, whose generous\r\nnumbers are frequently augmented by the addition of a special star,\r\nor by a number of extra performers, such as Rough Riders or other\r\nspecialists. It may be, occasionally, that the exigencies of the\r\noccasion require the work of a performing horse, dog, or other animal.\r\nNo matter what the object required may be, whether animate or inanimate,\r\nif it is necessary for the play it is found and pressed into service.\r\n\r\nThese two studios, while separated from the main plant, are under the\r\nsame general management, and their original negative films are forwarded\r\nas made to the Orange works, where the large copying department is\r\nlocated in one of the concrete buildings. Here, after the film has been\r\npassed upon by a committee, a considerable number of positive copies are\r\nmade by ingenious processes, and after each one is separately tested, or\r\n\"run off,\" in one or other of the three motion-picture theatres in the\r\nbuilding, they are shipped out to film exchanges in every part of the\r\ncountry. How extensive this business has become may be appreciated when\r\nit is stated that at the Orange plant there are produced at this time\r\nover eight million feet of motion-picture film per year. And Edison's\r\ncompany is only one of many producers.\r\n\r\nAnother of the industries at the Orange works is the manufacture of\r\nprojecting kinetoscopes, by means of which the motion pictures are\r\nshown. While this of itself is also a business of considerable magnitude\r\nin its aggregate yearly transactions, it calls for no special comment\r\nin regard to commercial production, except to note that a corps of\r\nexperimenters is constantly employed refining and perfecting details\r\nof the machine. Its basic features of operation as conceived by Edison\r\nremain unchanged.\r\n\r\nOn coming to consider the Edison battery enterprises, we must perforce\r\nextend the territorial view to include a special chemical-manufacturing\r\nplant, which is in reality a branch of the laboratory and the Orange\r\nworks, although actually situated about three miles away.\r\n\r\nBoth the primary and the storage battery employ certain chemical\r\nproducts as essential parts of their elements, and indeed owe their very\r\nexistence to the peculiar preparation and quality of such products, as\r\nexemplified by Edison's years of experimentation and research. Hence the\r\nestablishment of his own chemical works at Silver Lake, where, under his\r\npersonal supervision, the manufacture of these products is carried on\r\nin charge of specially trained experts. At the present writing the\r\nplant covers about seven acres of ground; but there is ample room for\r\nexpansion, as Edison, with wise forethought, secured over forty acres of\r\nland, so as to be prepared for developments.\r\n\r\nNot only is the Silver Lake works used for the manufacture of the\r\nchemical substances employed in the batteries, but it is the plant at\r\nwhich the Edison primary battery is wholly assembled and made up for\r\ndistribution to customers. This in itself is a business of no small\r\nmagnitude, having grown steadily on its merits year by year until it\r\nhas now arrived at a point where its sales run into the hundreds of\r\nthousands of cells per annum, furnished largely to the steam railroads\r\nof the country for their signal service.\r\n\r\nAs to the storage battery, the plant at Silver Lake is responsible only\r\nfor the production of the chemical compounds, nickel-hydrate and iron\r\noxide, which enter into its construction. All the mechanical parts,\r\nthe nickel plating, the manufacture of nickel flake, the assembling and\r\ntesting, are carried on at the Orange works in two of the large concrete\r\nbuildings above referred to. A visit to this part of the plant reveals\r\nan amazing fertility of resourcefulness and ingenuity in the devising\r\nof the special machines and appliances employed in constructing the\r\nmechanical parts of these cells, for it is practically impossible to\r\nfashion them by means of machinery and tools to be found in the open\r\nmarket, notwithstanding the immense variety that may be there obtained.\r\n\r\nSince Edison completed his final series of investigations on his\r\nstorage battery and brought it to its present state of perfection, the\r\ncommercial values have increased by leaps and bounds. The battery, as\r\nit was originally put out some years ago, made for itself an enviable\r\nreputation; but with its improved form there has come a vast increase\r\nof business. Although the largest of the concrete buildings where\r\nits manufacture is carried on is over four hundred feet long and four\r\nstories in height, it has already become necessary to plan extensions\r\nand enlargements of the plant in order to provide for the production of\r\nbatteries to fill the present demands. It was not until the summer\r\nof 1909 that Edison was willing to pronounce the final verdict of\r\nsatisfaction with regard to this improved form of storage battery; but\r\nsubsequent commercial results have justified his judgment, and it is\r\nnot too much to predict that in all probability the business will assume\r\ngigantic proportions within a very few years. At the present time (1910)\r\nthe Edison storage-battery enterprise is in its early stages of growth,\r\nand its status may be compared with that of the electric-light system\r\nabout the year 1881.\r\n\r\nThere is one more industry, though of comparatively small extent,\r\nthat is included in the activities of the Orange works, namely,\r\nthe manufacture and sale of the Bates numbering machine. This is a\r\nwell-known article of commerce, used in mercantile establishments for\r\nthe stamping of consecutive, duplicate, and manifold numbers on\r\nchecks and other documents. It is not an invention of Edison, but the\r\norganization owning it, together with the patent rights, were acquired\r\nby him some years ago, and he has since continued and enlarged the\r\nbusiness both in scope and volume, besides, of course, improving and\r\nperfecting the apparatus itself. These machines are known everywhere\r\nthroughout the country, and while the annual sales are of comparatively\r\nmoderate amount in comparison with the totals of the other Edison\r\nindustries at Orange, they represent in the aggregate a comfortable and\r\nencouraging business.\r\n\r\nIn this brief outline review of the flourishing and extensive commercial\r\nenterprises centred around the Orange laboratory, the facts, it is\r\nbelieved, contain a complete refutation of the idea that an inventor\r\ncannot be a business man. They also bear abundant evidence of the\r\ncompatibility of these two widely divergent gifts existing, even to a\r\nhigh degree, in the same person. A striking example of the correctness\r\nof this proposition is afforded in the present case, when it is borne in\r\nmind that these various industries above described (whose annual sales\r\nrun into many millions of dollars) owe not only their very creation\r\n(except the Bates machine) and existence to Edison's inventive\r\noriginality and commercial initiative, but also their continued growth\r\nand prosperity to his incessant activities in dealing with their\r\nmultifarious business problems. In publishing a portrait of Edison this\r\nyear, one of the popular magazines placed under it this caption: \"Were\r\nthe Age called upon to pay Thomas A. Edison all it owes to him, the Age\r\nwould have to make an assignment.\" The present chapter will have\r\nthrown some light on the idiosyncrasies of Edison as financier and as\r\nmanufacturer, and will have shown that while the claim thus suggested\r\nmay be quite good, it will certainly never be pressed or collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF EDISON'S INVENTIONS TO THE WORLD\r\n\r\nIF the world were to take an account of stock, so to speak, and proceed\r\nin orderly fashion to marshal its tangible assets in relation to\r\ndollars and cents, the natural resources of our globe, from centre to\r\ncircumference, would head the list. Next would come inventors, whose\r\nvalue to the world as an asset could be readily estimated from an\r\nincrease of its wealth resulting from the actual transformations of\r\nthese resources into items of convenience and comfort through the\r\nexercise of their inventive ingenuity.\r\n\r\nInventors of practical devices may be broadly divided into two\r\nclasses--first, those who may be said to have made two blades of grass\r\ngrow where only one grew before; and, second, great inventors, who have\r\nmade grass grow plentifully on hitherto unproductive ground. The vast\r\nmajority of practical inventors belong to and remain in the first of\r\nthese divisions, but there have been, and probably always will be, a\r\nless number who, by reason of their greater achievements, are entitled\r\nto be included in both classes. Of these latter, Thomas Alva Edison is\r\none, but in the pages of history he stands conspicuously pre-eminent--a\r\ncommanding towering figure, even among giants.\r\n\r\nThe activities of Edison have been of such great range, and his\r\nconquests in the domains of practical arts so extensive and varied, that\r\nit is somewhat difficult to estimate with any satisfactory degree of\r\naccuracy the money value of his inventions to the world of to-day, even\r\nafter making due allowance for the work of other great inventors and\r\nthe propulsive effect of large amounts of capital thrown into the\r\nenterprises which took root, wholly or in part, through the productions\r\nof his genius and energies. This difficulty will be apparent, for\r\ninstance, when we consider his telegraph and telephone inventions. These\r\nwere absorbed in enterprises already existing, and were the means of\r\nassisting their rapid growth and expansion, particularly the telephone\r\nindustry. Again, in considering the fact that Edison was one of the\r\nfirst in the field to design and perfect a practical and operative\r\nelectric railway, the main features of which are used in all electric\r\nroads of to-day, we are confronted with the problem as to what\r\nproportion of their colossal investment and earnings should be ascribed\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nDifficulties are multiplied when we pause for a moment to think of\r\nEdison's influence on collateral branches of business. In the public\r\nmind he is credited with the invention of the incandescent electric\r\nlight, the phonograph, and other widely known devices; but how few\r\nrealize his actual influence on other trades that are not generally\r\nthought of in connection with these things. For instance, let us note\r\nwhat a prominent engine builder, the late Gardiner C. Sims, has said:\r\n\"Watt, Corliss, and Porter brought forward steam-engines to a high\r\nstate of proficiency, yet it remained for Mr. Edison to force better\r\nproportions, workmanship, designs, use of metals, regulation, the\r\nsolving of the complex problems of high speed and endurance, and the\r\nsuccessful development of the shaft governor. Mr. Edison is preeminent\r\nin the realm of engineering.\"\r\n\r\nThe phenomenal growth of the copper industry was due to a rapid and\r\never-increasing demand, owing to the exploitation of the telephone,\r\nelectric light, electric motor, and electric railway industries. Without\r\nthese there might never have been the romance of \"Coppers\" and the rise\r\nand fall of countless fortunes. And although one cannot estimate in\r\ndefinite figures the extent of Edison's influence in the enormous\r\nincrease of copper production, it is to be remembered that his basic\r\ninventions constitute a most important factor in the demand for the\r\nmetal. Besides, one must also give him the credit, as already noted,\r\nfor having recognized the necessity for a pure quality of copper for\r\nelectric conductors, and for his persistence in having compelled the\r\nmanufacturers of that period to introduce new and additional methods\r\nof refinement so as to bring about that result, which is now a sine qua\r\nnon.\r\n\r\nStill considering his influence on other staples and collateral trades,\r\nlet us enumerate briefly and in a general manner some of the more\r\nimportant and additional ones that have been not merely stimulated, but\r\nin many cases the business and sales have been directly increased and\r\nnew arts established through the inventions of this one man--namely,\r\niron, steel, brass, zinc, nickel, platinum ($5 per ounce in 1878, now\r\n$26 an ounce), rubber, oils, wax, bitumen, various chemical compounds,\r\nbelting, boilers, injectors, structural steel, iron tubing, glass,\r\nsilk, cotton, porcelain, fine woods, slate, marble, electrical measuring\r\ninstruments, miscellaneous machinery, coal, wire, paper, building\r\nmaterials, sapphires, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe question before us is, To what extent has Edison added to the wealth\r\nof the world by his inventions and his energy and perseverance? It will\r\nbe noted from the foregoing that no categorical answer can be offered\r\nto such a question, but sufficient material can be gathered from a\r\nstatistical review of the commercial arts directly influenced to afford\r\nan approximate idea of the increase in national wealth that has been\r\naffected by or has come into being through the practical application of\r\nhis ideas.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, as to inventions capable of fairly definite estimate, let\r\nus mention the incandescent electric light and systems of distribution\r\nof electric light, heat, and power, which may justly be considered as\r\nthe crowning inventions of Edison's life. Until October 21, 1879, there\r\nwas nothing in existence resembling our modern incandescent lamp.\r\nOn that date, as we have seen in a previous chapter, Edison's labors\r\nculminated in his invention of a practical incandescent electric lamp\r\nembodying absolutely all the essentials of the lamp of to-day, thus\r\nopening to the world the doors of a new art and industry. To-day there\r\nare in the United States more than 41,000,000 of these lamps, connected\r\nto existing central-station circuits in active operation.\r\n\r\nSuch circuits necessarily imply the existence of central stations with\r\ntheir equipment. Until the beginning of 1882 there were only a few\r\narc-lighting stations in existence for the limited distribution of\r\ncurrent. At the present time there are over 6000 central stations in\r\nthis country for the distribution of electric current for light,\r\nheat, and power, with capital obligations amounting to not less than\r\n$1,000,000,000. Besides the above-named 41,000,000 incandescent lamps\r\nconnected to their mains, there are about 500,000 arc lamps and 150,000\r\nmotors, using 750,000 horse-power, besides countless fan motors and\r\nelectric heating and cooking appliances.\r\n\r\nWhen it is stated that the gross earnings of these central stations\r\napproximate the sum of $225,000,000 yearly, the significant import of\r\nthese statistics of an art that came so largely from Edison's laboratory\r\nabout thirty years ago will undoubtedly be apparent.\r\n\r\nBut the above are not by any means all the facts relating to\r\nincandescent electric lighting in the United States, for in addition to\r\ncentral stations there are upward of 100,000 isolated or private plants\r\nin mills, factories, steamships, hotels, theatres, etc., owned by\r\nthe persons or concerns who operate them. These plants represent an\r\napproximate investment of $500,000,000, and the connection of not less\r\nthan 25,000,000 incandescent lamps or their equivalent.\r\n\r\nThen there are the factories where these incandescent lamps are made,\r\nabout forty in number, representing a total investment that may be\r\napproximated at $25,000,000. It is true that many of these factories\r\nare operated by other than the interests which came into control of\r\nthe Edison patents (General Electric Company), but the 150,000,000\r\nincandescent electric lamps now annually made are broadly covered in\r\nprinciple by Edison's fundamental ideas and patents.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that these figures are all in round numbers, but they\r\nare believed to be well within the mark, being primarily founded upon\r\nthe special reports of the Census Bureau issued in 1902 and 1907, with\r\nthe natural increase from that time computed by experts who are in\r\nposition to obtain the facts. It would be manifestly impossible to give\r\nexact figures of such a gigantic and swiftly moving industry, whose\r\ntotals increase from week to week.\r\n\r\nThe reader will naturally be disposed to ask whether it is intended to\r\nclaim that Edison has brought about all this magnificent growth of the\r\nelectric-lighting art. The answer to this is decidedly in the negative,\r\nfor the fact is that he laid some of the foundation and erected a\r\nbuilding thereon, and in the natural progressive order of things other\r\ninventors of more or less fame have laid substructures or added a wing\r\nhere and a story there until the resultant great structure has attained\r\nsuch proportions as to evoke the admiration of the beholder; but the old\r\nfoundation and the fundamental building still remain to support other\r\nparts. In other words, Edison created the incandescent electric lamp,\r\nand invented certain broad and fundamental systems of distribution\r\nof current, with all the essential devices of detail necessary for\r\nsuccessful operation. These formed a foundation. He also spent great\r\nsums of money and devoted several years of patient labor in the early\r\npractical exploitation of the dynamo and central station and isolated\r\nplants, often under, adverse and depressing circumstances, with a dogged\r\ndetermination that outlived an opposition steadily threatening defeat.\r\nThese efforts resulted in the firm commercial establishment of modern\r\nelectric lighting. It is true that many important inventions of others\r\nhave a distinguished place in the art as it is exploited today, but the\r\nfact remains that the broad essentials, such as the incandescent lamp,\r\nsystems of distribution, and some important details, are not only\r\nuniversally used, but are as necessary to-day for successful commercial\r\npractice as they were when Edison invented them many years ago.\r\n\r\nThe electric railway next claims our consideration, but we are\r\nimmediately confronted by a difficulty which seems insurmountable when\r\nwe attempt to formulate any definite estimate of the value and influence\r\nof Edison's pioneer work and inventions. There is one incontrovertible\r\nfact--namely, that he was the first man to devise, construct, and\r\noperate from a central station a practicable, life-size electric\r\nrailroad, which was capable of transporting and did transport passengers\r\nand freight at variable speeds over varying grades, and under complete\r\ncontrol of the operator. These are the essential elements in all\r\nelectric railroading of the present day; but while Edison's original\r\nbroad ideas are embodied in present practice, the perfection of the\r\nmodern electric railway is greatly due to the labors and inventions of\r\na large number of other well-known inventors. There was no reason\r\nwhy Edison could not have continued the commercial development of the\r\nelectric railway after he had helped to show its practicability in 1880,\r\n1881, and 1882, just as he had completed his lighting system, had it\r\nnot been that his financial allies of the period lacked faith in the\r\npossibilities of electric railroads, and therefore declined to furnish\r\nthe money necessary for the purpose of carrying on the work.\r\n\r\nWith these facts in mind, we shall ask the reader to assign to Edison a\r\ndue proportion of credit for his pioneer and basic work in relation to\r\nthe prodigious development of electric railroading that has since taken\r\nplace. The statistics of 1908 for American street and elevated railways\r\nshow that within twenty-five years the electric-railway industry has\r\ngrown to embrace 38,812 miles of track on streets and for elevated\r\nrailways, operated under the ownership of 1238 separate companies, whose\r\ntotal capitalization amounted to the enormous sum of $4,123,834,598.\r\nIn the equipments owned by such companies there are included 68,636\r\nelectric cars and 17,568 trailers and others, making a total of 86,204\r\nof such vehicles. These cars and equipments earned over $425,000,000\r\nin 1907, in giving the public transportation, at a cost, including\r\ntransfers, of a little over three cents per passenger, for whom a\r\nfifteen-mile ride would be possible. It is the cheapest transportation\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nSome mention should also be made of the great electrical works of the\r\ncountry, in which the dynamos, motors, and other varied paraphernalia\r\nare made for electric lighting, electric railway, and other purposes.\r\nThe largest of these works is undoubtedly that of the General\r\nElectric Company at Schenectady, New York, a continuation and enormous\r\nenlargement of the shops which Edison established there in 1886. This\r\nplant at the present time embraces over 275 acres, of which sixty acres\r\nare covered by fifty large and over one hundred small buildings; besides\r\nwhich the company also owns other large plants elsewhere, representing\r\na total investment approximating the sum of $34,850,000 up to 1908. The\r\nproductions of the General Electric Company alone average annual\r\nsales of nearly $75,000,000, but they do not comprise the total of the\r\ncountry's manufactures in these lines.\r\n\r\nTurning our attention now to the telephone, we again meet a condition\r\nthat calls for thoughtful consideration before we can properly\r\nappreciate how much the growth of this industry owes to Edison's\r\ninventive genius. In another place there has already been told the story\r\nof the telephone, from which we have seen that to Alexander Graham\r\nBell is due the broad idea of transmission of speech by means of an\r\nelectrical circuit; also that he invented appropriate instruments and\r\ndevices through which he accomplished this result, although not to that\r\nextent which gave promise of any great commercial practicability for\r\nthe telephone as it then existed. While the art was in this inefficient\r\ncondition, Edison went to work on the subject, and in due time, as we\r\nhave already learned, invented and brought out the carbon transmitter,\r\nwhich is universally acknowledged to have been the needed device that\r\ngave to the telephone the element of commercial practicability, and\r\nhas since led to its phenomenally rapid adoption and world-wide use. It\r\nmatters not that others were working in the same direction, Edison was\r\nlegally adjudicated to have been the first to succeed in point of\r\ntime, and his inventions were put into actual use, and may be found in\r\nprinciple in every one of the 7,000,000 telephones which are estimated\r\nto be employed in the country at the present day. Basing the statements\r\nupon facts shown by the Census reports of 1902 and 1907, and adding\r\nthereto the growth of the industry since that time, we find on a\r\nconservative estimate that at this writing the investment has been not\r\nless than $800,000,000 in now existing telephone systems, while no fewer\r\nthan 10,500,000,000 talks went over the lines during the year 1908.\r\nThese figures relate only to telephone systems, and do not include any\r\ndetails regarding the great manufacturing establishments engaged in\r\nthe construction of telephone apparatus, of which there is a production\r\namounting to at least $15,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nLeaving the telephone, let us now turn our attention to the telegraph,\r\nand endeavor to show as best we can some idea of the measure to which it\r\nhas been affected by Edison's inventions. Although, as we have seen in\r\na previous part of this book, his earliest fame arose from his great\r\npractical work in telegraphic inventions and improvements, there is no\r\nway in which any definite computation can be made of the value of his\r\ncontributions in the art except, perhaps, in the case of his quadruplex,\r\nthrough which alone it is estimated that there has been saved from\r\n$15,000,000 to $20,000,000 in the cost of line construction in this\r\ncountry. If this were the only thing that he had ever accomplished,\r\nit would entitle him to consideration as an inventor of note. The\r\nquadruplex, however, has other material advantages, but how far they and\r\nthe natural growth of the business have contributed to the investment\r\nand earnings of the telegraph companies, is beyond practicable\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nIt would, perhaps, be interesting to speculate upon what might have been\r\nthe growth of the telegraph and the resultant benefit to the community\r\nhad Edison's automatic telegraph inventions been allowed to take their\r\nlegitimate place in the art, but we shall not allow ourselves to\r\nindulge in flights of fancy, as the value of this chapter rests not upon\r\nconjecture, but only upon actual fact. Nor shall we attempt to offer any\r\nstatistics regarding Edison's numerous inventions relating to telegraphs\r\nand kindred devices, such as stock tickers, relays, magnets, rheotomes,\r\nrepeaters, printing telegraphs, messenger calls, etc., on which he was\r\nso busily occupied as an inventor and manufacturer during the ten years\r\nthat began with January, 1869. The principles of many of these devices\r\nare still used in the arts, but have become so incorporated in other\r\ndevices as to be inseparable, and cannot now be dealt with separately.\r\nTo show what they mean, however, it might be noted that New York City\r\nalone has 3000 stock \"tickers,\" consuming 50,000 miles of record tape\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nTurning now to other important arts and industries which have been\r\ncreated by Edison's inventions, and in which he is at this time taking\r\nan active personal interest, let us visit Orange, New Jersey. When his\r\npresent laboratory was nearing completion in 1887, he wrote to Mr. J.\r\nHood Wright, a partner in the firm of Drexel, Morgan & Co.: \"My ambition\r\nis to build up a great industrial works in the Orange Valley, starting\r\nin a small way and gradually working up.\"\r\n\r\nIn this plant, which represents an investment approximating the sum\r\nof $4,000,000, are grouped a number of industrial enterprises of which\r\nEdison is either the sole or controlling owner and the guiding spirit.\r\nThese enterprises are the National Phonograph Company, the Edison\r\nBusiness Phonograph Company, the Edison Phonograph Works, the Edison\r\nManufacturing Company, the Edison Storage Battery Company, and the\r\nBates Manufacturing Company. The importance of these industries will be\r\napparent when it is stated that at this plant the maximum pay-roll shows\r\nthe employment of over 4200 persons, with annual earnings in salaries\r\nand wages of more than $2,750,000.\r\n\r\nIn considering the phonograph in its commercial aspect, and endeavoring\r\nto arrive at some idea of the world's estimate of the value of this\r\ninvention, we feel the ground more firm under our feet, for Edison\r\nhas in later years controlled its manufacture and sale. It will be\r\nremembered that the phonograph lay dormant, commercially speaking,\r\nfor about ten years after it came into being, and then later invention\r\nreduced it to a device capable of more popular utility. A few years\r\nof rather unsatisfactory commercial experience brought about a\r\nreorganization, through which Edison resumed possession of the business.\r\nIt has since been continued under his general direction and ownership,\r\nand he has made a great many additional inventions tending to improve\r\nthe machine in all its parts.\r\n\r\nThe uses made of the phonograph up to this time have been of four kinds,\r\ngenerally speaking--first, and principally, for amusement; second,\r\nfor instruction in languages; third, for business, in the dictation of\r\ncorrespondence; and fourth, for sentimental reasons in preserving the\r\nvoices of friends. No separate figures are available to show the extent\r\nof its employment in the second and fourth classes, as they are probably\r\nincluded in machines coming under the first subdivision. Under this head\r\nwe find that there have been upward of 1,310,000 phonographs sold during\r\nthe last twenty years, with and for which there have been made and\r\nsold no fewer than 97,845,000 records of a musical or other character.\r\nPhonographic records are now being manufactured at Orange at the rate\r\nof 75,000 a day, the annual sale of phonographs and records being\r\napproximately $7,000,000, including business phonographs. This does not\r\ninclude blank records, of which large numbers have also been supplied to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the business phonograph has not been characterized\r\nby the unanimity that obtained in the case of the one used merely for\r\namusement, as its use involves some changes in methods that business\r\nmen are slow to adopt until they realize the resulting convenience and\r\neconomy. Although it is only a few years since the business phonograph\r\nhas begun to make some headway, it is not difficult to appreciate that\r\nEdison's prediction in 1878 as to the value of such an appliance is\r\nbeing realized, when we find that up to this time the sales run up to\r\n12,695 in number. At the present time the annual sales of the business\r\nphonographs and supplies, cylinders, etc., are not less than $350,000.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that the basic patent of Edison on the phonograph has\r\nlong since expired, thus throwing open to the world the wonderful art\r\nof reproducing human speech and other sounds. The world was not slow to\r\ntake advantage of the fact, hence there are in the field numerous other\r\nconcerns in the same business. It is conservatively estimated by those\r\nwho know the trade and are in position to form an opinion, that the\r\nfigures above given represent only about one-half of the entire business\r\nof the country in phonographs, records, cylinders, and supplies.\r\n\r\nTaking next his inventions that pertain to a more recently established\r\nbut rapidly expanding branch of business that provides for the amusement\r\nof the public, popularly known as \"motion pictures,\" we also find a\r\ngeneral recognition of value created. Referring the reader to a previous\r\nchapter for a discussion of Edison's standing as a pioneer inventor in\r\nthis art, let us glance at the commercial proportions of this young but\r\nlusty business, whose ramifications extend to all but the most remote\r\nand primitive hamlets of our country.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of the projecting machines and accessories, together\r\nwith the reproduction of films, is carried on at the Orange Valley\r\nplant, and from the inception of the motion-picture business to the\r\npresent time there have been made upward of 16,000 projecting machines\r\nand many million feet of films carrying small photographs of moving\r\nobjects. Although the motion-picture business, as a commercial\r\nenterprise, is still in its youth, it is of sufficient moment to call\r\nfor the annual production of thousands of machines and many million\r\nfeet of films in Edison's shops, having a sale value of not less than\r\n$750,000. To produce the originals from which these Edison films are\r\nmade, there have been established two \"studios,\" the largest of which is\r\nin the Bronx, New York City.\r\n\r\nIn this, as well as in the phonograph business, there are many other\r\nmanufacturers in the field. Indeed, the annual product of the Edison\r\nManufacturing Company in this line is only a fractional part of the\r\ntotal that is absorbed by the 8000 or more motion-picture theatres and\r\nexhibitions that are in operation in the United States at the present\r\ntime, and which represent an investment of some $45,000,000. Licensees\r\nunder Edison patents in this country alone produce upward of 60,000,000\r\nfeet of films annually, containing more than a billion and a half\r\nseparate photographs. To what extent the motion-picture business may\r\ngrow in the not remote future it is impossible to conjecture, for it has\r\ntaken a place in the front rank of rapidly increasing enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture and sale of the Edison-Lalande primary battery,\r\nconducted by the Edison Manufacturing Company at the Orange Valley\r\nplant, is a business of no mean importance. Beginning about twenty\r\nyears ago with a battery that, without polarizing, would furnish large\r\ncurrents specially adapted for gas-engine ignition and other important\r\npurposes, the business has steadily grown in magnitude until the present\r\noutput amounts to about 125,000 cells annually; the total number of\r\ncells put into the hands of the public up to date being approximately\r\n1,500,000. It will be readily conceded that to most men this alone would\r\nbe an enterprise of a lifetime, and sufficient in itself to satisfy a\r\nmoderate ambition. But, although it has yielded a considerable profit to\r\nEdison and gives employment to many people, it is only one of the many\r\nsmaller enterprises that owe an existence to his inventive ability and\r\ncommercial activity.\r\n\r\nSo it also is in regard to the mimeograph, whose forerunner, the\r\nelectric pen, was born of Edison's brain in 1877. He had been long\r\nimpressed by the desirability of the rapid production of copies of\r\nwritten documents, and, as we have seen by a previous chapter, he\r\ninvented the electric pen for this purpose, only to improve upon it\r\nlater with a more desirable device which he called the mimeograph, that\r\nis in use, in various forms, at this time. Although the electric pen had\r\na large sale and use in its time, the statistics relating to it are not\r\navailable. The mimeograph, however, is, and has been for many years,\r\na standard office appliance, and is entitled to consideration, as the\r\ntotal number put into use up to this time is approximately 180,000,\r\nvalued at $3,500,000, while the annual output is in the neighborhood\r\nof 9000 machines, sold for about $150,000, besides the vast quantity of\r\nspecial paper and supplies which its use entails in the production of\r\nthe many millions of facsimile letters and documents. The extent of\r\nproduction and sale of supplies for the mimeograph may be appreciated\r\nwhen it is stated that they bring annually an equivalent of three times\r\nthe amount realized from sales of machines. The manufacture and sale\r\nof the mimeograph does not come within the enterprises conducted under\r\nEdison's personal direction, as he sold out the whole thing some years\r\nago to Mr. A. B. Dick, of Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn making a somewhat radical change of subject, from duplicating\r\nmachines to cement, we find ourselves in a field in which Edison has\r\nmade a most decided impression. The reader has already learned that his\r\nentry into this field was, in a manner, accidental, although logically\r\nin line with pronounced convictions of many years' standing, and\r\nfollowing up the fund of knowledge gained in the magnetic ore-milling\r\nbusiness. From being a new-comer in the cement business, his corporation\r\nin five years has grown to be the fifth largest producer in the United\r\nStates, with a still increasing capacity. From the inception of this\r\nbusiness there has been a steady and rapid development, resulting in the\r\nproduction of a grand total of over 7,300,000 barrels of cement up\r\nto the present date, having a value of about $6,000,000, exclusive of\r\npackage. At the time of this writing, the rate of production is over\r\n8000 barrels of cement per day, or, say, 2,500,000 barrels per year,\r\nhaving an approximate selling value of a little less than $2,000,000,\r\nwith prospects of increasing in the near future to a daily output of\r\n10,000 barrels. This enterprise is carried on by a corporation called\r\nthe Edison Portland Cement Company, in which he is very largely\r\ninterested, and of which he is the active head and guiding spirit.\r\n\r\nHad not Edison suspended the manufacture and sale of his storage battery\r\na few years ago because he was not satisfied with it, there might have\r\nbeen given here some noteworthy figures of an extensive business, for\r\nthe company's books show an astonishing number of orders that were\r\nreceived during the time of the shut-down. He was implored for\r\nbatteries, but in spite of the fact that good results had been obtained\r\nfrom the 18,000 or 20,000 cells sold some years ago, he adhered firmly\r\nto his determination to perfect them to a still higher standard before\r\nresuming and continuing their manufacture as a regular commodity. As we\r\nhave noted in a previous chapter, however, deliveries of the perfected\r\ntype were begun in the summer of 1909, and since that time the\r\nbusiness has continued to grow in the measure indicated by the earlier\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThus far we have concerned ourselves chiefly with those figures which\r\nexhibit the extent of investment and production, but there is another\r\nand humanly important side that presents itself for consideration\r\nnamely, the employment of a vast industrial army of men and women,\r\nwho earn a living through their connection with some of the arts and\r\nindustries to which our narrative has direct reference. To this the\r\nreader's attention will now be drawn.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are based upon the Special Reports of the Census\r\nBureau, 1902 and 1907, with additions computed upon the increase that\r\nhas subsequently taken place. In the totals following is included the\r\ncompensation paid to salaried officials and clerks. Details relating to\r\ntelegraph systems are omitted.\r\n\r\nTaking the electric light into consideration first, we find that in the\r\ncentral stations of the United States there are not less than an average\r\nof 50,000 persons employed, requiring an aggregate yearly payroll of\r\nover $40,000,000. This does not include the 100,000 or more isolated\r\nelectric-light plants scattered throughout the land. Many of these\r\nare quite large, and at least one-third of them require one additional\r\nhelper, thus adding, say, 33,000 employees to the number already\r\nmentioned. If we assume as low a wage as $10 per week for each of\r\nthese helpers, we must add to the foregoing an additional sum of over\r\n$17,000,000 paid annually for wages, almost entirely in the isolated\r\nincandescent electric lighting field.\r\n\r\nCentral stations and isolated plants consume over 100,000,000\r\nincandescent electric lamps annually, and in the production of these\r\nthere are engaged about forty factories, on whose pay-rolls appear\r\nan average of 14,000 employees, earning an aggregate yearly sum of\r\n$8,000,000.\r\n\r\nFollowing the incandescent lamp we must not forget an industry\r\nexclusively arising from it and absolutely dependent upon it--namely,\r\nthat of making fixtures for such lamps, the manufacture of which gives\r\nemployment to upward of 6000 persons, who annually receive at least\r\n$3,750,000 in compensation.\r\n\r\nThe detail devices of the incandescent electric lighting system also\r\ncontribute a large quota to the country's wealth in the millions of\r\ndollars paid out in salaries and wages to many thousands of persons who\r\nare engaged in their manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe electric railways of our country show even larger figures than the\r\nlighting stations and plants, as they employ on the average over\r\n250,000 persons, whose annual compensation amounts to not less than\r\n$155,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of about $50,000,000 worth of dynamos and motors\r\nannually, for central-station equipment, isolated plants, electric\r\nrailways, and other purposes, the manufacturers of the country employ an\r\naverage of not less than 30,000 people, whose yearly pay-roll amounts to\r\nno less a sum than $20,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the telephone systems of the United States also furnishes\r\nus with statistics of an analogous nature, for we find that the average\r\nnumber of employees engaged in this industry is at least 140,000, whose\r\nannual earnings aggregate a minimum of $75,000,000; besides which the\r\nmanufacturers of telephone apparatus employ over 12,000 persons, to whom\r\nis paid annually about $5,500,000.\r\n\r\nNo attempt is made to include figures of collateral industries,\r\nsuch, for instance, as copper, which is very closely allied with the\r\nelectrical arts, and the great bulk of which is refined electrically.\r\n\r\nThe 8000 or so motion-picture theatres of the country employ no fewer\r\nthan 40,000 people, whose aggregate annual income amounts to not less\r\nthan $37,000,000.\r\n\r\nComing now to the Orange Valley plant, we take a drop from these figures\r\nto the comparatively modest ones which give us an average of 3600\r\nemployees and calling for an annual pay-roll of about $2,250,000. It\r\nmust be remembered, however, that the sums mentioned above represent\r\nindustries operated by great aggregations of capital, while the Orange\r\nValley plant, as well as the Edison Portland Cement Company, with an\r\naverage daily number of 530 employees and over $400,000 annual pay-roll,\r\nrepresent in a large measure industries that are more in the nature\r\nof closely held enterprises and practically under the direction of one\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe table herewith given summarizes the figures that have just been\r\npresented, and affords an idea of the totals affected by the genius\r\nof this one man. It is well known that many other men and many other\r\ninventions have been needed for the perfection of these arts; but it\r\nis equally true that, as already noted, some of these industries are\r\ndirectly the creation of Edison, while in every one of the rest his\r\nimpress has been deep and significant. Before he began inventing, only\r\ntwo of them were known at all as arts--telegraphy and the manufacture\r\nof cement. Moreover, these figures deal only with the United States, and\r\ntake no account of the development of many of the Edison inventions\r\nin Europe or of their adoption throughout the world at large.

Nevertheless, in writing a biography of Edison, the\r\nmain object is to present the facts as they are, and leave it to the\r\nintelligent reader to classify, apply, and analyze them in such manner\r\nas appeals most forcibly to his intellectual processes. If in the\r\nforegoing pages there has appeared to be a tendency to attribute to\r\nEdison the entire credit for the growth to which many of the above-named\r\ngreat enterprises have in these latter days attained, we must especially\r\ndisclaim any intention of giving rise to such a deduction. No one who\r\nhas carefully followed the course of this narrative can deny, however,\r\nthat Edison is the father of some of the arts and industries that have\r\nbeen mentioned, and that as to some of the others it was the magic of\r\nhis touch that helped make them practicable. Not only to his work and\r\ningenuity is due the present magnitude of these arts and industries, but\r\nit is attributable also to the splendid work and numerous contributions\r\nof other great inventors, such as Brush, Bell, Elihu Thomson, Weston,\r\nSprague, and many others, as well as to the financiers and investors who\r\nin the past thirty years have furnished the vast sums of money that were\r\nnecessary to exploit and push forward these enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe reader may have noticed in a perusal of this chapter the lack of\r\nautobiographical quotations, such as have appeared in other parts of\r\nthis narrative. Edison's modesty has allowed us but one remark on the\r\nsubject. This was made by him to one of the writers a short time ago,\r\nwhen, after an interesting indulgence in reminiscences of old times and\r\nearly inventions, he leaned back in his chair, and with a broad smile on\r\nhis face, said, reflectively: \"Say, I HAVE been mixed up in a whole lot\r\nof things, haven't I?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK FLAG\r\n\r\nTHROUGHOUT the forty-odd years of his creative life, Edison has realized\r\nby costly experience the truth of the cynical proverb that \"A patent\r\nis merely a title to a lawsuit.\" It is not intended, however, by this\r\nstatement to lead to any inference on the part of the reader that HE\r\nstands peculiarly alone in any such experience, for it has been and\r\nstill is the common lot of every successful inventor, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nTo attribute dishonesty or cupidity as the root of the defence in all\r\npatent litigation would be aiming very wide of the mark, for in no\r\nclass of suits that come before the courts are there any that present\r\na greater variety of complex, finely shaded questions, or that\r\nrequire more delicacy of interpretation, than those that involve the\r\nconstruction of patents, particularly those relating to electrical\r\ndevices. Indeed, a careful study of legal procedure of this character\r\ncould not be carried far without discovery of the fact that in numerous\r\ninstances the differences of opinion between litigants were marked by\r\nthe utmost bona fides.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, such study would reveal many cases of undoubted\r\nfraudulent intent, as well as many bold attempts to deprive the inventor\r\nof the fruits of his endeavors by those who have sought to evade,\r\nthrough subtle technicalities of the law, the penalty justly due them\r\nfor trickery, evasion, or open contempt of the rights of others.\r\n\r\nIn the history of science and of the arts to which the world has\r\nowed its continued progress from year to year there is disclosed one\r\nremarkable fact, and that is, that whenever any important discovery or\r\ninvention has been made and announced by one man, it has almost always\r\nbeen disclosed later that other men--possibly widely separated and\r\nknowing nothing of the other's work--have been following up the same\r\ngeneral lines of investigation, independently, with the same object in\r\nmind. Their respective methods might be dissimilar while tending to the\r\nsame end, but it does not necessarily follow that any one of these other\r\nexperimenters might ever have achieved the result aimed at, although,\r\nafter the proclamation of success by one, it is easy to believe that\r\neach of the other independent investigators might readily persuade\r\nhimself that he would ultimately have reached the goal in just that same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar coincidence of simultaneous but separate work not only\r\ncomes to light on the bringing out of great and important discoveries\r\nor inventions, but becomes more apparent if a new art is disclosed, for\r\nthen the imagination of previous experimenters is stimulated through\r\nwide dissemination of the tidings, sometimes resulting in more or less\r\neffort to enter the newly opened field with devices or methods that\r\nresemble closely the original and fundamental ones in principle and\r\napplication. In this and other ways there arises constantly in the\r\nUnited States Patent Office a large number of contested cases, called\r\n\"Interferences,\" where applications for patents covering the invention\r\nof a similar device have been independently filed by two or even more\r\npersons. In such cases only one patent can be issued, and that to\r\nthe inventor who on the taking of testimony shows priority in date of\r\ninvention. [20]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 20: A most remarkable instance of contemporaneous\r\n     invention and without a parallel in the annals of the United\r\n     States Patent Office, occurred when, on the same day,\r\n     February 15, 1876, two separate descriptions were filed in\r\n     that office, one a complete application and the other a\r\n     caveat, but each covering an invention for \"transmitting\r\n     vocal sounds telegraphically.\" The application was made by\r\n     Alexander Graham Bell, of Salem, Massachusetts, and the\r\n     caveat by Elisha Gray, of Chicago, Illinois. On examination\r\n     of the two papers it was found that both of them covered\r\n     practically the same ground, hence, as only one patent could\r\n     be granted, it became necessary to ascertain the precise\r\n     hour at which the documents were respectively filed, and put\r\n     the parties in interference. This was done, with the result\r\n     that the patent was ultimately awarded to Bell.]\r\n\r\nIn the opening up and development of any new art based upon a\r\nfundamental discovery or invention, there ensues naturally an era of\r\nsupplemental or collateral inventive activity--the legitimate outcome\r\nof the basic original ideas. Part of this development may be due to\r\nthe inventive skill and knowledge of the original inventor and his\r\nassociates, who, by reason of prior investigation, would be in better\r\nposition to follow up the art in its earliest details than others,\r\nwho might be regarded as mere outsiders. Thus a new enterprise may be\r\npresented before the world by its promoters in the belief that they are\r\nstrongly fortified by patent rights which will protect them in a degree\r\ncommensurate with the risks they have assumed.\r\n\r\nSupplemental inventions, however, in any art, new or old, are not\r\nlimited to those which emanate from the original workers, for the\r\ningenuity of man, influenced by the spirit of the times, seizes upon any\r\nnovel line of action and seeks to improve or enlarge upon it, or, at\r\nany rate, to produce more or less variation of its phases. Consequently,\r\nthere is a constant endeavor on the part of a countless host of men\r\npossessing some degree of technical skill and inventive ability, to win\r\nfame and money by entering into the already opened fields of endeavor\r\nwith devices and methods of their own, for which subsidiary patents may\r\nbe obtainable. Some of such patents may prove to be valuable, while\r\nit is quite certain that in the natural order of things others will\r\nbe commercially worthless, but none may be entirely disregarded in the\r\nhistory and development of the art.\r\n\r\nIt will be quite obvious, therefore, that the advent of any useful\r\ninvention or discovery, great or small, is followed by a clashing of\r\nmany interests which become complex in their interpretation by reason of\r\nthe many conflicting claims that cluster around the main principle. Nor\r\nis the confusion less confounded through efforts made on the part of\r\ndishonest persons, who, like vultures, follow closely on the trail\r\nof successful inventors and (sometimes through information derived\r\nby underhand methods) obtain patents on alleged inventions, closely\r\napproximating the real ones, solely for the purpose of harassing the\r\noriginal patentee until they are bought up, or else, with the intent\r\nof competing boldly in the new business, trust in the delays of legal\r\nproceedings to obtain a sure foothold in their questionable enterprise.\r\n\r\nThen again there are still others who, having no patent rights, but\r\nwaving aside all compunction and in downright fraud, simply enter the\r\ncommercial field against the whole world, using ruthlessly whatever\r\ninventive skill and knowledge the original patentee may have disclosed,\r\nand trusting to the power of money, rapid movement, and mendacious\r\nadvertising to build up a business which shall presently assume such\r\nformidable proportions as to force a compromise, or stave off an\r\ninjunction until the patent has expired. In nine cases out of ten such\r\na course can be followed with relative impunity; and guided by skilful\r\nexperts who may suggest really trivial changes here and there over the\r\npatented structure, and with the aid of keen and able counsel, hardly a\r\npatent exists that could not be invaded by such infringers. Such is\r\nthe condition of our laws and practice that the patentee in seeking to\r\nenforce his rights labors under a terrible handicap.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, in this recital of perplexing conditions confronting the\r\ninventor, there must not be forgotten the commercial \"shark,\" whose\r\npredatory instincts are ever keenly alert for tender victims. In the\r\nwake of every newly developed art of world-wide importance there is\r\nsure to follow a number of unscrupulous adventurers, who hasten to take\r\nadvantage of general public ignorance of the true inwardness of affairs.\r\nBasing their operations on this lack of knowledge, and upon the tendency\r\nof human nature to give credence to widely advertised and high-sounding\r\ndescriptions and specious promises of vast profits, these men find\r\nlittle difficulty in conjuring money out of the pockets of the\r\nunsophisticated and gullible, who rush to become stockholders in\r\nconcerns that have \"airy nothings\" for a foundation, and that collapse\r\nquickly when the bubble is pricked. [21]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 21: A notable instance of the fleecing of\r\n     unsuspecting and credulous persons occurred in the early\r\n     eighties, during the furor occasioned by the introduction of\r\n     Mr. Edison's electric-light system. A corporation claiming\r\n     to have a self-generating dynamo (practically perpetual\r\n     motion) advertised its preposterous claims extensively, and\r\n     actually succeeded in selling a large amount of stock,\r\n     which, of course, proved to be absolutely worthless.]\r\n\r\nTo one who is unacquainted with the trying circumstances attending\r\nthe introduction and marketing of patented devices, it might seem\r\nunnecessary that an inventor and his business associates should be\r\nobliged to take into account the unlawful or ostensible competition of\r\npirates or schemers, who, in the absence of legal decision, may run a\r\nfree course for a long time. Nevertheless, as public patronage is the\r\nelement vitally requisite for commercial success, and as the public is\r\nnot usually in full possession of all the facts and therefore cannot\r\ndiscriminate between the genuine and the false, the legitimate inventor\r\nmust avail himself of every possible means of proclaiming and asserting\r\nhis rights if he desires to derive any benefit from the results of his\r\nskill and labor. Not only must he be prepared to fight in the Patent\r\nOffice and pursue a regular course of patent litigation against those\r\nwho may honestly deem themselves to be protected by other inventions\r\nor patents of similar character, and also proceed against more palpable\r\ninfringers who are openly, defiantly, and illegitimately engaged in\r\ncompetitive business operations, but he must, as well, endeavor to\r\nprotect himself against the assaults of impudent fraud by educating the\r\npublic mind to a point of intelligent apprehension of the true status of\r\nhis invention and the conflicting claims involved.\r\n\r\nWhen the nature of a patent right is considered it is difficult to see\r\nwhy this should be so. The inventor creates a new thing--an invention of\r\nutility--and the people, represented by the Federal Government, say to\r\nhim in effect: \"Disclose your invention to us in a patent so that we may\r\nknow how to practice it, and we will agree to give you a monopoly for\r\nseventeen years, after which we shall be free to use it. If the right\r\nthus granted is invaded, apply to a Federal Court and the infringer will\r\nbe enjoined and required to settle in damages.\" Fair and false promise!\r\nIs it generally realized that no matter how flagrant the infringement\r\nnor how barefaced and impudent the infringer, no Federal Court will\r\ngrant an injunction UNTIL THE PATENT SHALL HAVE BEEN FIRST LITIGATED TO\r\nFINAL HEARING AND SUSTAINED? A procedure, it may be stated, requiring\r\nyears of time and thousands of dollars, during which other infringers\r\nhave generally entered the field, and all have grown fat.\r\n\r\nThus Edison and his business associates have been forced into a\r\nveritable maelstrom of litigation during the major part of the last\r\nforty years, in the effort to procure for themselves a small measure\r\nof protection for their interests under the numerous inventions of note\r\nthat he has made at various times in that period. The earlier years of\r\nhis inventive activity, while productive of many important contributions\r\nto electrical industries, such as stock tickers and printers, duplex,\r\nquadruplex, and automatic telegraphs, were not marked by the turmoil\r\nof interminable legal conflicts that arose after the beginning of the\r\ntelephone and electric-light epochs. In fact, his inventions; up to\r\nand including his telephone improvements (which entered into already\r\nexisting arts), had been mostly purchased by the Western Union and other\r\ncompanies, and while there was more or less contesting of his claims\r\n(especially in respect of the telephone), the extent of such litigation\r\nwas not so conspicuously great as that which centred subsequently around\r\nhis patents covering incandescent electric lighting and power systems.\r\n\r\nThrough these inventions there came into being an entirely new art,\r\ncomplete in its practicability evolved by Edison after protracted\r\nexperiments founded upon most patient, thorough, and original methods\r\nof investigation extending over several years. Long before attaining\r\nthe goal, he had realized with characteristic insight the underlying\r\nprinciples of the great and comprehensive problem he had started out\r\nto solve, and plodded steadily along the path that he had marked out,\r\nignoring the almost universal scientific disbelief in his ultimate\r\nsuccess. \"Dreamer,\" \"fool,\" \"boaster\" were among the appellations\r\nbestowed upon him by unbelieving critics. Ridicule was heaped upon\r\nhim in the public prints, and mathematics were called into service\r\nby learned men to settle the point forever that he was attempting the\r\nutterly impossible.\r\n\r\nBut, presto! no sooner had he accomplished the task and shown concrete\r\nresults to the world than he found himself in the anomalous position\r\nof being at once surrounded by the conditions which inevitably confront\r\nevery inventor. The path through the trackless forest had been blazed,\r\nand now every one could find the way. At the end of the road was a rich\r\nprize belonging rightfully to the man who had opened a way to it, but\r\nthe struggles of others to reach it by more or less honest methods now\r\nbegan and continued for many years. If, as a former commissioner once\r\nsaid, \"Edison was the man who kept the path to the Patent Office\r\nhot with his footsteps,\" there were other great inventors abreast or\r\nimmediately on his heels, some, to be sure, with legitimate, original\r\nmethods and vital improvements representing independent work; while\r\nthere were also those who did not trouble to invent, but simply helped\r\nthemselves to whatever ideas were available, and coming from any source.\r\n\r\nPossibly events might have happened differently had Edison been able to\r\nprevent the announcement of his electric-light inventions until he\r\nwas entirely prepared to bring out the system as a whole, ready for\r\ncommercial exploitation, but the news of his production of a practical\r\nand successful incandescent lamp became known and spread like wild-fire\r\nto all corners of the globe. It took more than a year after the\r\nevolution of the lamp for Edison to get into position to do actual\r\nbusiness, and during that time his laboratory was the natural Mecca of\r\nevery inquiring person. Small wonder, then, that when he was prepared to\r\nmarket his invention he should find others entering that market, at\r\nhome and abroad, at the same time, and with substantially similar\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nEdison narrates two incidents that may be taken as characteristic of\r\na good deal that had to be contended with, coming in the shape of\r\nnefarious attack. \"In the early days of my electric light,\" he says,\r\n\"curiosity and interest brought a great many people to Menlo Park to see\r\nit. Some of them did not come with the best of intentions. I remember\r\nthe visit of one expert, a well-known electrician, a graduate of Johns\r\nHopkins University, and who then represented a Baltimore gas company. We\r\nhad the lamps exhibited in a large room, and so arranged on a table as\r\nto illustrate the regular layout of circuits for houses and streets.\r\nSixty of the men employed at the laboratory were used as watchers, each\r\nto keep an eye on a certain section of the exhibit, and see there was\r\nno monkeying with it. This man had a length of insulated No. 10 wire\r\npassing through his sleeves and around his back, so that his hands would\r\nconceal the ends and no one would know he had it. His idea, of course,\r\nwas to put this wire across the ends of the supplying circuits, and\r\nshort-circuit the whole thing--put it all out of business without being\r\ndetected. Then he could report how easily the electric light went out,\r\nand a false impression would be conveyed to the public. He did not know\r\nthat we had already worked out the safety-fuse, and that every group\r\nof lights was thus protected independently. He put this jumper slyly in\r\ncontact with the wires--and just four lamps went out on the section he\r\ntampered with. The watchers saw him do it, however, and got hold of him\r\nand just led him out of the place with language that made the recording\r\nangels jump for their typewriters.\"\r\n\r\nThe other incident is as follows: \"Soon after I had got out the\r\nincandescent light I had an interference in the Patent Office with a man\r\nfrom Wisconsin. He filed an application for a patent and entered into a\r\nconspiracy to 'swear back' of the date of my invention, so as to\r\ndeprive me of it. Detectives were put on the case, and we found he was a\r\n'faker,' and we took means to break the thing up. Eugene Lewis, of Eaton\r\n& Lewis, had this in hand for me. Several years later this same man\r\nattempted to defraud a leading firm of manufacturing chemists in New\r\nYork, and was sent to State prison. A short time after that a syndicate\r\ntook up a man named Goebel and tried to do the same thing, but again our\r\ndetective-work was too much for them. This was along the same line as\r\nthe attempt of Drawbaugh to deprive Bell of his telephone. Whenever\r\nan invention of large prospective value comes out, these cases always\r\noccur. The lamp patent was sustained in the New York Federal Court. I\r\nthought that was final and would end the matter, but another Federal\r\njudge out in St. Louis did not sustain it. The result is I have never\r\nenjoyed any benefits from my lamp patents, although I fought for many\r\nyears.\" The Goebel case will be referred to later in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe original owner of the patents and inventions covering his\r\nelectric-lighting system, the Edison Electric Light Company (in which\r\nEdison was largely interested as a stockholder), thus found at the\r\noutset that its commercial position was imperilled by the activity of\r\ncompetitors who had sprung up like mushrooms. It became necessary to\r\ntake proper preliminary legal steps to protect the interests which had\r\nbeen acquired at the cost of so much money and such incessant toil and\r\nexperiment. During the first few years in which the business of the\r\nintroduction of the light was carried on with such strenuous and\r\nconcentrated effort, the attention of Edison and his original associates\r\nwas constantly focused upon the commercial exploitation and the\r\nfurther development of the system at home and abroad. The difficult\r\nand perplexing situation at that time is thus described by Major S. B.\r\nEaton:\r\n\r\n\"The reason for the delay in beginning and pushing suits for\r\ninfringements of the lamp patent has never been generally understood. In\r\nmy official position as president of the Edison Electric Light Company\r\nI became the target, along with Mr. Edison, for censure from the\r\nstockholders and others on account of this delay, and I well remember\r\nhow deep the feeling was. In view of the facts that a final injunction\r\non the lamp patent was not obtained until the life of the patent was\r\nnear its end, and, next, that no damages in money were ever paid by\r\nthe guilty infringers, it has been generally believed that Mr. Edison\r\nsacrificed the interest of his stockholders selfishly when he delayed\r\nthe prosecution of patent suits and gave all his time and energies to\r\nmanufacturing. This belief was the stronger because the manufacturing\r\nenterprises belonged personally to Mr. Edison and not to his company.\r\nBut the facts render it easy to dispel this false belief. The Edison\r\ninventions were not only a lamp; they comprised also an entire system of\r\ncentral stations. Such a thing was new to the world, and the apparatus,\r\nas well as the manufacture thereof, was equally new. Boilers,\r\nengines, dynamos, motors, distribution mains, meters, house-wiring,\r\nsafety-devices, lamps, and lamp-fixtures--all were vital parts of the\r\nwhole system. Most of them were utterly novel and unknown to the arts,\r\nand all of them required quick, and, I may say, revolutionary thought\r\nand invention. The firm of Babcock & Wilcox gave aid on the boilers,\r\nArmington & Sims undertook the engines, but everything else was\r\nabnormal. No factories in the land would take up the manufacture. I\r\nremember, for instance, our interviews with Messrs. Mitchell, Vance &\r\nCo., the leading manufacturers of house gas-lighting fixtures, such as\r\nbrackets and chandeliers. They had no faith in electric lighting, and\r\nrejected all our overtures to induce them to take up the new business\r\nof making electric-light fixtures. As regards other parts of the Edison\r\nsystem, notably the Edison dynamo, no such machines had ever existed;\r\nthere was no factory in the world equipped to make them, and,\r\nmost discouraging of all, the very scientific principles of their\r\nconstruction were still vague and experimental.\r\n\r\n\"What was to be done? Mr. Edison has never been greater than when he met\r\nand solved this crisis. 'If there are no factories,' he said, 'to make\r\nmy inventions, I will build the factories myself. Since capital is\r\ntimid, I will raise and supply it. The issue is factories or death.' Mr.\r\nEdison invited the cooperation of his leading stockholders. They lacked\r\nconfidence or did not care to increase their investments. He was forced\r\nto go on alone. The chain of Edison shops was then created. By far the\r\nmost perplexing of these new manufacturing problems was the lamp. Not\r\nonly was it a new industry, one without shadow of prototype, but the\r\nmechanical devices for making the lamps, and to some extent the very\r\nmachines to make those devices, were to be invented. All of this was\r\ndone by the courage, capital, and invincible energy and genius of the\r\ngreat inventor. But Mr. Edison could not create these great and diverse\r\nindustries and at the same time give requisite attention to litigation.\r\nHe could not start and develop the new and hard business of electric\r\nlighting and yet spare one hour to pursue infringers. One thing or the\r\nother must wait. All agreed that it must be the litigation. And right\r\nthere a lasting blow was given to the prestige of the Edison patents.\r\nThe delay was translated as meaning lack of confidence; and the alert\r\ninfringer grew strong in courage and capital. Moreover, and what was the\r\nheaviest blow of all, he had time, thus unmolested, to get a good start.\r\n\r\n\"In looking back on those days and scrutinizing them through the years,\r\nI am impressed by the greatness, the solitary greatness I may say, of\r\nMr. Edison. We all felt then that we were of importance, and that our\r\ncontribution of effort and zeal were vital. I can see now, however, that\r\nthe best of us was nothing but the fly on the wheel. Suppose anything\r\nhad happened to Edison? All would have been chaos and ruin.. To him,\r\ntherefore, be the glory, if not the profit.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks of Major Eaton show authoritatively how the\r\nmuch-discussed delay in litigating the Edison patents was so greatly\r\nmisunderstood at the time, and also how imperatively necessary it was\r\nfor Edison and his associates to devote their entire time and energies\r\nto the commercial development of the art. As the lighting business\r\nincreased, however, and a great number of additional men were initiated\r\ninto its mysteries, Edison and his experts were able to spare some\r\ntime to legal matters, and an era of active patent litigation against\r\ninfringers was opened about the year 1885 by the Edison company, and\r\nthereafter continued for many years.\r\n\r\nWhile the history of this vast array of legal proceedings possesses a\r\nfascinating interest for those involved, as well as for professional\r\nmen, legal and scientific, it could not be expected that it would\r\nexcite any such feeling on the part of a casual reader. Hence, it is\r\nnot proposed to encumber this narrative with any detailed record of the\r\nnumerous suits that were brought and conducted through their complicated\r\nramifications by eminent counsel. Suffice it to say that within about\r\nsixteen years after the commencement of active patent litigation, there\r\nhad been spent by the owners of the Edison lighting patents upward\r\nof two million dollars in prosecuting more than two hundred lawsuits\r\nbrought against persons who were infringing many of the patents of\r\nEdison on the incandescent electric lamp and component parts of his\r\nsystem. Over fifty separate patents were involved in these suits,\r\nincluding the basic one on the lamp (ordinarily called the \"Filament\"\r\npatent), other detail lamp patents, as well as those on sockets,\r\nswitches, dynamos, motors, and distributing systems.\r\n\r\nThe principal, or \"test,\" suit on the \"Filament\" patent was that brought\r\nagainst \"The United States Electric Lighting Company,\" which became a\r\ncause celebre in the annals of American jurisprudence. Edison's claims\r\nwere strenuously and stubbornly contested throughout a series of intense\r\nlegal conflicts that raged in the courts for a great many years. Both\r\nsides of the controversy were represented by legal talent of the\r\nhighest order, under whose examination and cross-examination volumes\r\nof testimony were taken, until the printed record (including exhibits)\r\namounted to more than six thousand pages. Scientific and technical\r\nliterature and records in all parts of the civilized world were\r\nsubjected to the most minute scrutiny of opposing experts in the\r\nendeavor to prove Edison to be merely an adapter of methods and devices\r\nalready projected or suggested by others. The world was ransacked for\r\nanything that might be claimed as an anticipation of what he had done.\r\nEvery conceivable phase of ingenuity that could be devised by\r\ntechnical experts was exercised in the attempt to show that Edison\r\nhad accomplished nothing new. Everything that legal acumen could\r\nsuggest--every subtle technicality of the law--all the complicated\r\nvariations of phraseology that the novel nomenclature of a young\r\nart would allow--all were pressed into service and availed of by the\r\ncontestors of the Edison invention in their desperate effort to defeat\r\nhis claims. It was all in vain, however, for the decision of the court\r\nwas in favor of Edison, and his lamp patent was sustained not only by\r\nthe tribunal of the first resort, but also by the Appellate Court some\r\ntime afterward.\r\n\r\nThe first trial was had before Judge Wallace in the United States\r\nCircuit Court for the Southern District of New York, and the appeal was\r\nheard by Judges Lacombe and Shipman, of the United States Circuit Court\r\nof Appeals. Before both tribunals the cause had been fully represented\r\nby counsel chosen from among the most eminent representatives of the\r\nbar at that time, those representing the Edison interests being the\r\nlate Clarence A. Seward and Grosvenor P. Lowrey, together with Sherburne\r\nBlake Eaton, Albert H. Walker, and Richard N. Dyer. The presentation of\r\nthe case to the courts had in both instances been marked by masterly and\r\nable arguments, elucidated by experiments and demonstrations to educate\r\nthe judges on technical points. Some appreciation of the magnitude of\r\nthis case may be gained from the fact that the argument on its first\r\ntrial employed a great many days, and the minutes covered hundreds\r\nof pages of closely typewritten matter, while the argument on appeal\r\nrequired eight days, and was set forth in eight hundred and fifty pages\r\nof typewriting. Eliminating all purely forensic eloquence and exparte\r\nstatements, the addresses of counsel in this celebrated suit are worthy\r\nof deep study by an earnest student, for, taken together, they comprise\r\nthe most concise, authentic, and complete history of the prior state of\r\nthe art and the development of the incandescent lamp that had been made\r\nup to that time. [22]\r\n\r\n     [22] The argument on appeal was conducted with the dignity\r\n     and decorum that characterize such a proceeding in that\r\n     court. There is usually little that savors of humor in the\r\n     ordinary conduct of a case of this kind, but in the present\r\n     instance a pertinent story was related by Mr. Lowrey, and it\r\n     is now reproduced. In the course of his address to the\r\n     court, Mr. Lowrey said:\r\n\r\n     \"I have to mention the name of one expert whose testimony\r\n     will, I believe, be found as accurate, as sincere, as\r\n     straightforward as if it were the preaching of the gospel. I\r\n     do it with great pleasure, and I ask you to read the\r\n     testimony of Charles L. Clarke along with that of Thomas A.\r\n     Edison. He had rather a hard row to hoe. He is a young\r\n     gentleman; he is a very well-instructed man in his\r\n     profession; he is not what I have called in the argument\r\n     below an expert in the art of testifying, like some of the\r\n     others, he has not yet become expert; what he may descend to\r\n     later cannot be known; he entered upon his first experience,\r\n     I think, with my brother Duncan, who is no trifler when he\r\n     comes to deal with these questions, and for several months\r\n     Mr. Clarke was pursued up and down, over a range of\r\n     suggestions of what he would have thought if he had thought\r\n     something else had been said at some time when something\r\n     else was not said.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Duncan--\"I got three pages a day out of him, too.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lowrey--\"Well, it was a good result. It always recalled\r\n     to me what I venture now, since my friend breaks in upon me\r\n     in this rude manner, to tell the court as well illustrative\r\n     of what happened there. It is the story of the pickerel and\r\n     the roach. My friend, Professor Von Reisenberg, of the\r\n     University of Ghent, pursued a series of investigations into\r\n     the capacity of various animals to receive ideas. Among the\r\n     rest he put a pickerel into a tank containing water, and\r\n     separated across its middle by a transparent glass plate,\r\n     and on the other side he put a red roach. Now your Honors\r\n     both know how a pickerel loves a red roach, and I have no\r\n     doubt you will remember that he is a fish of a very low\r\n     forehead and an unlimited appetite. When this pickerel saw\r\n     the red roach through the glass, he made one of those awful\r\n     dashes which is usually the ruin of whatever stands in its\r\n     way; but he didn't reach the red roach. He received an\r\n     impression, doubtless. It was not sufficient, however, to\r\n     discourage him, and he immediately tried again, and he\r\n     continued to try for three-quarters of an hour. At the end\r\n     of three-quarters of an hour he seemed a little shaken and\r\n     discouraged, and stopped, and the red roach was taken out\r\n     for that day and the pickerel left. On the succeeding day\r\n     the red roach was restored, and the pickerel had forgotten\r\n     the impressions of the first day, and he repeated this\r\n     again. At the end of the second day the roach was taken out.\r\n     This was continued, not through so long a period as the\r\n     effort to take my friend Clarke and devour him, but for a\r\n     period of about three weeks. At the end of the three weeks,\r\n     the time during which the pickerel persisted each day had\r\n     been shortened and shortened, until it was at last\r\n     discovered that he didn't try at all. The plate glass was\r\n     then removed, and the pickerel and the red roach sailed\r\n     around together in perfect peace ever afterward. The\r\n     pickerel doubtless attributed to the roach all this shaking,\r\n     the rebuff which he had received. And that is about the\r\n     condition in which my brother Duncan and my friend Clarke\r\n     were at the end of this examination.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Duncan--\"I notice on the redirect that Mr. Clarke\r\n     changed his color.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lowrey--\"Well, perhaps he was a different kind of a\r\n     roach then; but you didn't succeed in taking him.\r\n\r\n     \"I beg your Honors to read the testimony of Mr. Clarke in\r\n     the light of the anecdote of the pickerel and the roach.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to long-protracted delays incident to the taking of testimony and\r\npreparation for trial, the argument before the United States Circuit\r\nCourt of Appeals was not had until the late spring of 1892, and its\r\ndecision in favor of the Edison Lamp patent was filed on October 4,\r\n1892, MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS AFTER THE ISSUANCE OF THE PATENT ITSELF.\r\n\r\nAs the term of the patent had been limited under the law, because\r\ncertain foreign patents had been issued to Edison before that in this\r\ncountry, there was now but a short time left for enjoyment of the\r\nexclusive rights contemplated by the statute and granted to Edison and\r\nhis assigns by the terms of the patent itself. A vigorous and aggressive\r\nlegal campaign was therefore inaugurated by the Edison Electric Light\r\nCompany against the numerous infringing companies and individuals that\r\nhad sprung up while the main suit was pending. Old suits were revived\r\nand new ones instituted. Injunctions were obtained against many old\r\noffenders, and it seemed as though the Edison interests were about to\r\ncome into their own for the brief unexpired term of the fundamental\r\npatent, when a new bombshell was dropped into the Edison camp in the\r\nshape of an alleged anticipation of the invention forty years previously\r\nby one Henry Goebel. Thus, in 1893, the litigation was reopened, and a\r\nprotracted series of stubbornly contested conflicts was fought in the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nGoebel's claims were not unknown to the Edison Company, for as far back\r\nas 1882 they had been officially brought to its notice coupled with an\r\noffer of sale for a few thousand dollars. A very brief examination into\r\ntheir merits, however, sufficed to demonstrate most emphatically that\r\nGoebel had never made a practical incandescent lamp, nor had he ever\r\ncontributed a single idea or device bearing, remotely or directly, on\r\nthe development of the art. Edison and his company, therefore, rejected\r\nthe offer unconditionally and declined to enter into any arrangements\r\nwhatever with Goebel. During the prosecution of the suits in 1893 it\r\ntranspired that the Goebel claims had also been investigated by the\r\ncounsel of the defendant company in the principal litigation already\r\nrelated, but although every conceivable defence and anticipation had\r\nbeen dragged into the case during the many years of its progress, the\r\nalleged Goebel anticipation was not even touched upon therein. From\r\nthis fact it is quite apparent that they placed no credence on its bona\r\nfides.\r\n\r\nBut desperate cases call for desperate remedies. Some of the infringing\r\nlamp-manufacturing concerns, which during the long litigation had grown\r\nstrong and lusty, and thus far had not been enjoined by the court, now\r\nsaw injunctions staring them in the face, and in desperation set up the\r\nGoebel so-called anticipation as a defence in the suits brought against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis German watchmaker, Goebel, located in the East Side of New York\r\nCity, had undoubtedly been interested, in a desultory kind of way, in\r\nsimple physical phenomena, and a few trifling experiments made by him\r\nsome forty or forty-five years previously were magnified and distorted\r\ninto brilliant and all-comprehensive discoveries and inventions.\r\nAvalanches of affidavits of himself, \"his sisters and his cousins and\r\nhis aunts,\" practically all persons in ordinary walks of life, and of\r\nold friends, contributed a host of recollections that seemed little\r\nshort of miraculous in their detailed accounts of events of a scientific\r\nnature that were said to have occurred so many years before. According\r\nto affidavits of Goebel himself and some of his family, nothing that\r\nwould anticipate Edison's claim had been omitted from his work, for he\r\n(Goebel) claimed to have employed the all-glass globe, into which were\r\nsealed platinum wires carrying a tenuous carbon filament, from which the\r\noccluded gases had been liberated during the process of high exhaustion.\r\nHe had even determined upon bamboo as the best material for filaments.\r\nOn the face of it he was seemingly gifted with more than human\r\nprescience, for in at least one of his exhibit lamps, said to have been\r\nmade twenty years previously, he claimed to have employed processes\r\nwhich Edison and his associates had only developed by several years of\r\nexperience in making thousands of lamps!\r\n\r\nThe Goebel story was told by the affidavits in an ingenuous manner, with\r\na wealth of simple homely detail that carried on its face an appearance\r\nof truth calculated to deceive the elect, had not the elect been\r\nsomewhat prepared by their investigation made some eleven years before.\r\n\r\nThe story was met by the Edison interests with counter-affidavits,\r\nshowing its utter improbabilities and absurdities from the standpoint of\r\nmen of science and others versed in the history and practice of the art;\r\nalso affidavits of other acquaintances and neighbors of Goebel flatly\r\ndenying the exhibitions he claimed to have made. The issue thus being\r\njoined, the legal battle raged over different sections of the country. A\r\nnumber of contumeliously defiant infringers in various cities based fond\r\nhopes of immunity upon the success of this Goebel evidence, but were\r\ndefeated. The attitude of the courts is well represented in the opinion\r\nof Judge Colt, rendered in a motion for injunction against the Beacon\r\nVacuum Pump and Electrical Company. The defence alleged the Goebel\r\nanticipation, in support of which it offered in evidence four lamps,\r\nNos. 1, 2, and 3 purporting to have been made before 1854, and No. 4\r\nbefore 1872. After a very full review of the facts in the case, and\r\na fair consideration of the defendants' affidavits, Judge Colt in his\r\nopinion goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is extremely improbable that Henry Goebel constructed a practical\r\nincandescent lamp in 1854. This is manifest from the history of the art\r\nfor the past fifty years, the electrical laws which since that time have\r\nbeen discovered as applicable to the incandescent lamp, the imperfect\r\nmeans which then existed for obtaining a vacuum, the high degree of\r\nskill necessary in the construction of all its parts, and the crude\r\ninstruments with which Goebel worked.\r\n\r\n\"Whether Goebel made the fiddle-bow lamps, 1, 2, and 3, is not necessary\r\nto determine. The weight of evidence on this motion is in the direction\r\nthat he made these lamp or lamps similar in general appearance, though\r\nit is manifest that few, if any, of the many witnesses who saw the\r\nGoebel lamp could form an accurate judgment of the size of the filament\r\nor burner. But assuming they were made, they do not anticipate the\r\ninvention of Edison. At most they were experimental toys used to\r\nadvertise his telescope, or to flash a light upon his clock, or to\r\nattract customers to his shop. They were crudely constructed, and their\r\nlife was brief. They could not be used for domestic purposes. They\r\nwere in no proper sense the practical commercial lamp of Edison. The\r\nliterature of the art is full of better lamps, all of which are held not\r\nto anticipate the Edison patent.\r\n\r\n\"As for Lamp No. 4, I cannot but view it with suspicion. It presents\r\na new appearance. The reason given for not introducing it before the\r\nhearing is unsatisfactory. This lamp, to my mind, envelops with a cloud\r\nof distrust the whole Goebel story. It is simply impossible under the\r\ncircumstances to believe that a lamp so constructed could have been\r\nmade by Goebel before 1872. Nothing in the evidence warrants such a\r\nsupposition, and other things show it to be untrue. This lamp has a\r\ncarbon filament, platinum leading-in wires, a good vacuum, and is well\r\nsealed and highly finished. It is said that this lamp shows no traces of\r\nmercury in the bulb because the mercury was distilled, but Goebel says\r\nnothing about distilled mercury in his first affidavit, and twice\r\nhe speaks of the particles of mercury clinging to the inside of the\r\nchamber, and for that reason he constructed a Geissler pump after he\r\nmoved to 468 Grand Street, which was in 1877. Again, if this lamp has\r\nbeen in his possession since before 1872, as he and his son swear, why\r\nwas it not shown to Mr. Crosby, of the American Company, when he visited\r\nhis shop in 1881 and was much interested in his lamps? Why was it not\r\nshown to Mr. Curtis, the leading counsel for the defendants in the New\r\nYork cases, when he was asked to produce a lamp and promised to do so?\r\nWhy did not his son take this lamp to Mr. Bull's office in 1892, when\r\nhe took the old fiddle-bow lamps, 1, 2, and 3? Why did not his son take\r\nthis lamp to Mr. Eaton's office in 1882, when he tried to negotiate\r\nthe sale of his father's inventions to the Edison Company? A lamp so\r\nconstructed and made before 1872 was worth a large sum of money to those\r\ninterested in defeating the Edison patent like the American Company, and\r\nGoebel was not a rich man. Both he and one of his sons were employed in\r\n1881 by the American Company. Why did he not show this lamp to McMahon\r\nwhen he called in the interest of the American Company and talked over\r\nthe electrical matters? When Mr. Dreyer tried to organize a company in\r\n1882, and procured an option from him of all his inventions relating to\r\nelectric lighting for which $925 was paid, and when an old lamp of this\r\nkind was of vital consequence and would have insured a fortune, why was\r\nit not forthcoming? Mr. Dreyer asked Goebel to produce an old lamp, and\r\nwas especially anxious to find one pending his negotiations with the\r\nEdison Company for the sale of Goebel's inventions. Why did he not\r\nproduce this lamp in his interviews with Bohm, of the American Company,\r\nor Moses, of the Edison Company, when it was for his interest to do so?\r\nThe value of such an anticipation of the Edison lamp was made known to\r\nhim. He was desirous of realizing upon his inventions. He was proud of\r\nhis incandescent lamps, and was pleased to talk about them with anybody\r\nwho would listen. Is it conceivable under all these circumstances, that\r\nhe should have had this all-important lamp in his possession from 1872\r\nto 1893, and yet no one have heard of it or seen it except his son? It\r\ncannot be said that ignorance of the English language offers an excuse.\r\nHe knew English very well although Bohm and Dreyer conversed with him\r\nin German. His children spoke English. Neither his ignorance nor his\r\nsimplicity prevented him from taking out three patents: the first\r\nin 1865 for a sewing-machine hemmer, and the last in 1882 for an\r\nimprovement in incandescent lamps. If he made Lamp No. 4 previous to\r\n1872, why was it not also patented?\r\n\r\n\"There are other circumstances which throw doubt on this alleged Goebel\r\nanticipation. The suit against the United States Electric Lighting\r\nCompany was brought in the Southern District of New York in 1885. Large\r\ninterests were at stake, and the main defence to the Edison patent was\r\nbased on prior inventions. This Goebel claim was then investigated by\r\nthe leading counsel for the defence, Mr. Curtis. It was further inquired\r\ninto in 1892, in the case against the Sawyer-Man Company. It was brought\r\nto the attention and considered by the Edison Company in 1882. It was\r\nat that time known to the American Company, who hoped by this means to\r\ndefeat the monopoly under the Edison patent. Dreyer tried to organize\r\na company for its purchase. Young Goebel tried to sell it. It must have\r\nbeen known to hundreds of people. And now when the Edison Company after\r\nyears of litigation, leaving but a short time for the patent to run,\r\nhave obtained a final adjudication establishing its validity, this\r\nclaim is again resurrected to defeat the operation of the judgment\r\nso obtained. A court in equity should not look with favor on such\r\na defence. Upon the evidence here presented, I agree with the first\r\nimpression of Mr. Curtis and with the opinion of Mr. Dickerson that\r\nwhatever Goebel did must be considered as an abandoned experiment.\r\n\r\n\"It has often been laid down that a meritorious invention is not to be\r\ndefeated by something which rests in speculation or experiment, or which\r\nis rudimentary or incomplete.\r\n\r\n\"The law requires not conjecture, but certainty. It is easy after an\r\nimportant invention has gone into public use for persons to come forward\r\nwith claims that they invented the same thing years before, and to\r\nendeavor to establish this by the recollection of witnesses as to events\r\nlong past. Such evidence is to be received with great caution, and the\r\npresumption of novelty arising from the grant of the patent is not to be\r\novercome except upon clear and convincing proof.\r\n\r\n\"When the defendant company entered upon the manufacture of incandescent\r\nlamps in May, 1891, it well knew the consequences which must follow a\r\nfavorable decision for the Edison Company in the New York case.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe injunction was granted.\r\n\r\nOther courts took practically the same view of the Goebel story as was\r\ntaken by Judge Colt, and the injunctions asked in behalf of the Edison\r\ninterests were granted on all applications except one in St. Louis,\r\nMissouri, in proceedings instituted against a strong local concern of\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nThus, at the eleventh hour in the life of this important patent, after\r\na long period of costly litigation, Edison and his associates were\r\ncompelled to assume the defensive against a claimant whose utterly\r\nbaseless pretensions had already been thoroughly investigated and\r\nrejected years before by every interested party, and ultimately, on\r\nexamination by the courts, pronounced legally untenable, if not indeed\r\nactually fraudulent. Irritating as it was to be forced into the\r\nposition of combating a proposition so well known to be preposterous and\r\ninsincere, there was nothing else to do but to fight this fabrication\r\nwith all the strenuous and deadly earnestness that would have been\r\nbrought to bear on a really meritorious defence. Not only did this\r\nGoebel episode divert for a long time the energies of the Edison\r\ninterests from activities in other directions, but the cost of\r\novercoming the extravagantly absurd claims ran up into hundreds of\r\nthousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nAnother quotation from Major Eaton is of interest in this connection:\r\n\r\n\"Now a word about the Goebel case. I took personal charge of running\r\ndown this man and his pretensions in the section of the city where\r\nhe lived and among his old neighbors. They were a typical East Side\r\nlot--ignorant, generally stupid, incapable of long memory, but ready to\r\noblige a neighbor and to turn an easy dollar by putting a cross-mark at\r\nthe bottom of a forthcoming friendly affidavit. I can say in all truth\r\nand justice that their testimony was utterly false, and that the lawyers\r\nwho took it must have known it.\r\n\r\n\"The Goebel case emphasizes two defects in the court procedure in patent\r\ncases. One is that they may be spun out almost interminably, even,\r\npossibly, to the end of the life of the patent; the other is that the\r\njudge who decides the case does not see the witnesses. That adverse\r\ndecision at St. Louis would never have been made if the court could\r\nhave seen the men who swore for Goebel. When I met Mr. F. P. Fish on\r\nhis return from St. Louis, after he had argued the Edison side, he felt\r\nkeenly that disadvantage, to say nothing of the hopeless difficulty of\r\neducating the court.\"\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days of the art, when it was apparent that incandescent\r\nlighting had come to stay, the Edison Company was a shining mark at\r\nwhich the shafts of the dishonest were aimed. Many there were who\r\nstood ready to furnish affidavits that they or some one else whom they\r\ncontrolled had really invented the lamp, but would obligingly withdraw\r\nand leave Edison in possession of the field on payment of money.\r\nInvestigation of these cases, however, revealed invariably the purely\r\nfraudulent nature of all such offers, which were uniformly declined.\r\n\r\nAs the incandescent light began to advance rapidly in public favor, the\r\nimmense proportions of the future market became sufficiently obvious to\r\ntempt unauthorized persons to enter the field and become manufacturers.\r\nWhen the lamp became a thoroughly established article it was not a\r\ndifficult matter to copy it, especially when there were employees to be\r\nhired away at increased pay, and their knowledge utilized by the more\r\nunscrupulous of these new competitors. This is not conjecture but known\r\nto be a fact, and the practice continued many years, during which new\r\nlamp companies sprang up on every side. Hence, it is not surprising\r\nthat, on the whole, the Edison lamp litigation was not less remarkable\r\nfor quantity than quality. Between eighty and ninety separate suits upon\r\nEdison's fundamental lamp and detail patents were brought in the courts\r\nof the United States and prosecuted to completion.\r\n\r\nIn passing it may be mentioned that in England France, and Germany also\r\nthe Edison fundamental lamp patent was stubbornly fought in the judicial\r\narena, and his claim to be the first inventor of practical incandescent\r\nlighting was uniformly sustained in all those countries.\r\n\r\nInfringement was not, however, confined to the lamp alone, but, in\r\nAmerica, extended all along the line of Edison's patents relating to\r\nthe production and distribution of electric light, including those on\r\ndynamos, motors, distributing systems, sockets, switches, and other\r\ndetails which he had from time to time invented. Consequently, in order\r\nto protect its interests at all points, the Edison Company had found it\r\nnecessary to pursue a vigorous policy of instituting legal proceedings\r\nagainst the infringers of these various patents, and, in addition to the\r\nlarge number of suits on the lamp alone, not less than one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five other separate actions, involving some fifty or more of\r\nEdison's principal electric-lighting patents, were brought against\r\nconcerns which were wrongfully appropriating his ideas and actively\r\ncompeting with his companies in the market.\r\n\r\nThe ramifications of this litigation became so extensive and complex\r\nas to render it necessary to institute a special bureau, or department,\r\nthrough which the immense detail could be systematically sifted,\r\nanalyzed, and arranged in collaboration with the numerous experts\r\nand counsel responsible for the conduct of the various cases. This\r\ndepartment was organized in 1889 by Major Eaton, who was at this time\r\nand for some years afterward its general counsel.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of the head of this department a man of methodical and\r\nanalytical habit of mind was necessary, capable of clear reasoning, and\r\nat the same time one who had gained a thoroughly practical experience\r\nin electric light and power fields, and the choice fell upon Mr. W.\r\nJ. Jenks, the manager of the Edison central station at Brockton,\r\nMassachusetts. He had resigned that position in 1885, and had spent\r\nthe intervening period in exploiting the Edison municipal system of\r\nlighting, as well as taking an active part in various other branches of\r\nthe Edison enterprises.\r\n\r\nThus, throughout the life of Edison's patents on electric light, power,\r\nand distribution, the interminable legal strife has continued from\r\nday to day, from year to year. Other inventors, some of them great and\r\nnotable, have been coming into the field since the foundation of the\r\nart, patents have multiplied exceedingly, improvement has succeeded\r\nimprovement, great companies have grown greater, new concerns have come\r\ninto existence, coalitions and mergers have taken place, all tending\r\nto produce changes in methods, but not much in diminution of patent\r\nlitigation. While Edison has not for a long time past interested himself\r\nparticularly in electric light and power inventions, the bureau which\r\nwas initiated under the old regime in 1889 still continues, enlarged\r\nin scope, directed by its original chief, but now conducted under the\r\nauspices of several allied companies whose great volumes of combined\r\npatents (including those of Edison) cover a very wide range of the\r\nelectrical field.\r\n\r\nAs the general conception and theory of a lawsuit is the recovery of\r\nsome material benefit, the lay mind is apt to conceive of great sums of\r\nmoney being awarded to a complainant by way of damages upon a favorable\r\ndecision in an important patent case. It might, therefore, be natural to\r\nask how far Edison or his companies have benefited pecuniarily by reason\r\nof the many belated victories they have scored in the courts. To this\r\nquestion a strict regard for truth compels the answer that they have not\r\nbeen benefited at all, not to the extent of a single dollar, so far as\r\ncash damages are concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied, however, that substantial advantages have\r\naccrued to them more or less directly through the numerous favorable\r\ndecisions obtained by them as a result of the enormous amount of\r\nlitigation, in the prosecution of which so great a sum of money has been\r\nspent and so concentrated an amount of effort and time lavished. Indeed,\r\nit would be strange and unaccountable were the results otherwise. While\r\nthe benefits derived were not directly pecuniary in their nature, they\r\nwere such as tended to strengthen commercially the position of the\r\nrightful owners of the patents. Many irresponsible and purely piratical\r\nconcerns were closed altogether; others were compelled to take out\r\nroyalty licenses; consolidations of large interests were brought about;\r\nthe public was gradually educated to a more correct view of the true\r\nmerits of conflicting claims, and, generally speaking, the business has\r\nbeen greatly unified and brought within well-defined and controllable\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nNot only in relation to his electric light and power inventions has the\r\nprogress of Edison and his associates been attended by legal controversy\r\nall through the years of their exploitation, but also in respect to\r\nother inventions, notably those relating to the phonograph and to motion\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nThe increasing endeavors of infringers to divert into their own pockets\r\nsome of the proceeds arising from the marketing of the devices\r\ncovered by Edison's inventions on these latter lines, necessitated the\r\ninstitution by him, some years ago, of a legal department which, as in\r\nthe case of the light inventions, was designed to consolidate all law\r\nand expert work and place it under the management of a general counsel.\r\nThe department is of considerable extent, including a number of resident\r\nand other associate counsel, and a general office staff, all of whom are\r\nconstantly engaged from day to day in patent litigation and other legal\r\nwork necessary to protect the Edison interests. Through their labors the\r\nold story is reiterated in the contesting of approximate but conflicting\r\nclaims, the never-ending effort to suppress infringement, and the\r\ndestruction as far as possible of the commercial pirates who set sail\r\nupon the seas of all successful enterprises. The details, circumstances,\r\nand technical questions are, of course, different from those relating\r\nto other classes of inventions, and although there has been no cause\r\ncelebre concerning the phonograph and motion-picture patents, the\r\ncontention is as sharp and strenuous as it was in the cases relating to\r\nelectric lighting and heavy current technics.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison's storage battery and the poured cement house have not yet\r\nreached the stage of great commercial enterprises, and therefore have\r\nnot yet risen to the dignity of patent litigation. If, however, the\r\nexperience of past years is any criterion, there will probably come a\r\ntime in the future when, despite present widely expressed incredulity\r\nand contemptuous sniffs of unbelief in the practicability of his ideas\r\nin these directions, ultimate success will give rise to a series of\r\nhotly contested legal conflicts such as have signalized the practical\r\noutcome of his past efforts in other lines.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered what Edison has done, what the sum and substance\r\nof his contributions to human comfort and happiness have been, the\r\nresults, as measured by legal success, have been pitiable. With the\r\nexception of the favorable decision on the incandescent lamp filament\r\npatent, coming so late, however, that but little practical good was\r\naccomplished, the reader may search the law-books in vain for a single\r\ndecision squarely and fairly sustaining a single patent of first order.\r\nThere never was a monopoly in incandescent electric lighting, and even\r\nfrom the earliest days competitors and infringers were in the field\r\nreaping the benefits, and though defeated in the end, paying not a cent\r\nof tribute. The market was practically as free and open as if no patent\r\nexisted. There never was a monopoly in the phonograph; practically all\r\nof the vital inventions were deliberately appropriated by others, and\r\nthe inventor was laughed at for his pains. Even so beautiful a process\r\nas that for the duplication of phonograph records was solemnly held by\r\na Federal judge as lacking invention--as being obvious to any one. The\r\nmere fact that Edison spent years of his life in developing that process\r\ncounted for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the three-wire system, which, when it was first\r\nannounced as saving over 60 per cent. of copper in the circuits, was\r\nregarded as an utter impossibility--this patent was likewise held by\r\na Federal judge to be lacking in invention. In the motion-picture art,\r\ninfringements began with its very birth, and before the inevitable\r\nlitigation could be terminated no less than ten competitors were in the\r\nfield, with whom compromises had to be made.\r\n\r\nIn a foreign country, Edison would have undoubtedly received signal\r\nhonors; in his own country he has won the respect and admiration of\r\nmillions; but in his chosen field as an inventor and as a patentee his\r\nreward has been empty. The courts abroad have considered his patents in\r\na liberal spirit and given him his due; the decisions in this country\r\nhave fallen wide of the mark. We make no criticism of our Federal\r\njudges; as a body they are fair, able, and hard-working; but they\r\noperate under a system of procedure that stifles absolutely the\r\ndevelopment of inventive genius.\r\n\r\nUntil that system is changed and an opportunity offered for a final,\r\nswift, and economical adjudication of patent rights, American inventors\r\nmay well hesitate before openly disclosing their inventions to the\r\npublic, and may seriously consider the advisability of retaining them as\r\n\"trade secrets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL SIDE OF EDISON\r\n\r\nTHE title of this chapter might imply that there is an unsocial side\r\nto Edison. In a sense this is true, for no one is more impatient\r\nor intolerant of interruption when deeply engaged in some line of\r\nexperiment. Then the caller, no matter how important or what his\r\nmission, is likely to realize his utter insignificance and be sent away\r\nwithout accomplishing his object. But, generally speaking, Edison is\r\neasy tolerance itself, with a peculiar weakness toward those who have\r\nthe least right to make any demands on his time. Man is a social animal,\r\nand that describes Edison; but it does not describe accurately the\r\ninventor asking to be let alone.\r\n\r\nEdison never sought Society; but \"Society\" has never ceased to seek\r\nhim, and to-day, as ever, the pressure upon him to give up his work and\r\nreceive honors, meet distinguished people, or attend public functions,\r\nis intense. Only two or three years ago, a flattering invitation came\r\nfrom one of the great English universities to receive a degree, but at\r\nthat moment he was deep in experiments on his new storage battery, and\r\nnothing could budge him. He would not drop the work, and while highly\r\nappreciative of the proposed honor, let it go by rather than quit for\r\na week or two the stern drudgery of probing for the fact and the truth.\r\nWhether one approves or not, it is at least admirable stoicism, of which\r\nthe world has too little. A similar instance is that of a visit paid to\r\nthe laboratory by some one bringing a gold medal from a foreign society.\r\nIt was a very hot day in summer, the visitor was in full social regalia\r\nof silk hat and frock-coat, and insisted that he could deliver the medal\r\nonly into Edison's hands. At that moment Edison, stripped pretty nearly\r\ndown to the buff, was at the very crisis of an important experiment, and\r\nrefused absolutely to be interrupted. He had neither sought nor expected\r\nthe medal; and if the delegate didn't care to leave it he could take it\r\naway. At last Edison was overpersuaded, and, all dirty and perspiring as\r\nhe was, received the medal rather than cause the visitor to come again.\r\nOn one occasion, receiving a medal in New York, Edison forgot it on\r\nthe ferry-boat and left it behind him. A few years ago, when Edison\r\nhad received the Albert medal of the Royal Society of Arts, one of the\r\npresent authors called at the laboratory to see it. Nobody knew where\r\nit was; hours passed before it could be found; and when at last the\r\naccompanying letter was produced, it had an office date stamp right over\r\nthe signature of the royal president. A visitor to the laboratory with\r\none of these medallic awards asked Edison if he had any others. \"Oh\r\nyes,\" he said, \"I have a couple of quarts more up at the house!\" All\r\nthis sounds like lack of appreciation, but it is anything else than\r\nthat. While in Paris, in 1889, he wore the decoration of the Legion\r\nof Honor whenever occasion required, but at all other times turned the\r\nbadge under his lapel \"because he hated to have fellow-Americans think\r\nhe was showing off.\" And any one who knows Edison will bear testimony to\r\nhis utter absence of ostentation. It may be added that, in addition\r\nto the two quarts of medals up at the house, there will be found at\r\nGlenmont many other signal tokens of esteem and good-will--a beautiful\r\ncigar-case from the late Tsar of Russia, bronzes from the Government of\r\nJapan, steel trophies from Krupp, and a host of other mementos, to one\r\nof which he thus refers: \"When the experiments with the light were going\r\non at Menlo Park, Sarah Bernhardt came to America. One evening, Robert\r\nL. Cutting, of New York, brought her out to see the light. She was a\r\nterrific 'rubberneck.' She jumped all over the machinery, and I had one\r\nman especially to guard her dress. She wanted to know everything. She\r\nwould speak in French, and Cutting would translate into English. She\r\nstayed there about an hour and a half. Bernhardt gave me two pictures,\r\npainted by herself, which she sent me from Paris.\"\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the callers upon Edison; and to give\r\nsimply the names of persons of distinction would fill many pages of this\r\nrecord. Some were mere consumers of time; others were gladly welcomed,\r\nlike Lord Kelvin, the greatest physicist of the last century, with whom\r\nEdison was always in friendly communication. \"The first time I saw Lord\r\nKelvin, he came to my laboratory at Menlo Park in 1876.\" (He\r\nreported most favorably on Edison's automatic telegraph system at the\r\nPhiladelphia Exposition of 1876.) \"I was then experimenting with sending\r\neight messages simultaneously over a wire by means of synchronizing\r\ntuning-forks. I would take a wire with similar apparatus at both ends,\r\nand would throw it over on one set of instruments, take it away, and get\r\nit back so quickly that you would not miss it, thereby taking advantage\r\nof the rapidity of electricity to perform operations. On my local wire\r\nI got it to work very nicely. When Sir William Thomson (Kelvin) came in\r\nthe room, he was introduced to me, and had a number of friends with him.\r\nHe said: 'What have you here?' I told him briefly what it was. He then\r\nturned around, and to my great surprise explained the whole thing to\r\nhis friends. Quite a different exhibition was given two weeks later by\r\nanother well-known Englishman, also an electrician, who came in with\r\nhis friends, and I was trying for two hours to explain it to him and\r\nfailed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of the electric light, Edison was more than ever\r\nin demand socially, but he shunned functions like the plague, not\r\nonly because of the serious interference with work, but because of his\r\ndeafness. Some dinners he had to attend, but a man who ate little and\r\nheard less could derive practically no pleasure from them. \"George\r\nWashington Childs was very anxious I should go down to Philadelphia to\r\ndine with him. I seldom went to dinners. He insisted I should go--that\r\na special car would leave New York. It was for me to meet Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain. We had the private car of Mr. Roberts, President of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad. We had one of those celebrated dinners that only\r\nMr. Childs could give, and I heard speeches from Charles Francis Adams\r\nand different people. When I came back to the depot, Mr. Roberts\r\nwas there, and insisted on carrying my satchel for me. I never could\r\nunderstand that.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the more distinguished visitors of the electric-lighting period\r\nwas President Diaz, with whom Edison became quite intimate. \"President\r\nDiaz, of Mexico, visited this country with Mrs. Diaz, a highly educated\r\nand beautiful woman. She spoke very good English. They both took a deep\r\ninterest in all they saw. I don't know how it ever came about, as it is\r\nnot in my line, but I seemed to be delegated to show them around. I took\r\nthem to railroad buildings, electric-light plants, fire departments, and\r\nshowed them a great variety of things. It lasted two days.\" Of another\r\nvisit Edison says: \"Sitting Bull and fifteen Sioux Indians came to\r\nWashington to see the Great Father, and then to New York, and went\r\nto the Goerck Street works. We could make some very good pyrotechnics\r\nthere, so we determined to give the Indians a scare. But it didn't work.\r\nWe had an arc there of a most terrifying character, but they never moved\r\na muscle.\" Another episode at Goerck Street did not find the visitors\r\nquite so stoical. \"In testing dynamos at Goerck Street we had a long\r\nflat belt running parallel with the floor, about four inches above it,\r\nand travelling four thousand feet a minute. One day one of the\r\ndirectors brought in three or four ladies to the works to see the new\r\nelectric-light system. One of the ladies had a little poodle led by a\r\nstring. The belt was running so smoothly and evenly, the poodle did not\r\nnotice the difference between it and the floor, and got into the belt\r\nbefore we could do anything. The dog was whirled around forty or fifty\r\ntimes, and a little flat piece of leather came out--and the ladies\r\nfainted.\"\r\n\r\nA very interesting period, on the social side, was the visit paid by\r\nEdison and his family to Europe in 1889, when he had made a splendid\r\nexhibit of his inventions and apparatus at the great Paris Centennial\r\nExposition of that year, to the extreme delight of the French,\r\nwho welcomed him with open arms. The political sentiments that the\r\nExposition celebrated were not such as to find general sympathy in\r\nmonarchical Europe, so that the \"crowned heads\" were conspicuous by\r\ntheir absence. It was not, of course, by way of theatrical antithesis\r\nthat Edison appeared in Paris at such a time. But the contrast was none\r\nthe less striking and effective. It was felt that, after all, that which\r\nthe great exposition exemplified at its best--the triumph of genius\r\nover matter, over ignorance, over superstition--met with its due\r\nrecognition when Edison came to participate, and to felicitate a noble\r\nnation that could show so much in the victories of civilization and the\r\narts, despite its long trials and its long struggle for liberty. It is\r\nno exaggeration to say that Edison was greeted with the enthusiastic\r\nhomage of the whole French people. They could find no praise warm enough\r\nfor the man who had \"organized the echoes\" and \"tamed the lightning,\"\r\nand whose career was so picturesque with eventful and romantic\r\ndevelopment. In fact, for weeks together it seemed as though no Parisian\r\npaper was considered complete and up to date without an article on\r\nEdison. The exuberant wit and fancy of the feuilletonists seized\r\nupon his various inventions evolving from them others of the most\r\nextraordinary nature with which to bedazzle and bewilder the reader. At\r\nthe close of the Exposition Edison was created a Commander of the Legion\r\nof Honor. His own exhibit, made at a personal expense of over $100,000,\r\ncovered several thousand square feet in the vast Machinery Hall, and was\r\ncentred around a huge Edison lamp built of myriads of smaller lamps of\r\nthe ordinary size. The great attraction, however, was the display of the\r\nperfected phonograph. Several instruments were provided, and every day,\r\nall day long, while the Exposition lasted, queues of eager visitors from\r\nevery quarter of the globe were waiting to hear the little machine\r\ntalk and sing and reproduce their own voices. Never before was such\r\na collection of the languages of the world made. It was the first\r\nlinguistic concourse since Babel times. We must let Edison tell the\r\nstory of some of his experiences:\r\n\r\n\"At the Universal Exposition at Paris, in 1889, I made a personal\r\nexhibit covering about an acre. As I had no intention of offering to\r\nsell anything I was showing, and was pushing no companies, the whole\r\nexhibition was made for honor, and without any hope of profit. But the\r\nParis newspapers came around and wanted pay for notices of it, which we\r\npromptly refused; whereupon there was rather a stormy time for a while,\r\nbut nothing was published about it.\r\n\r\n\"While at the Exposition I visited the Opera-House. The President of\r\nFrance lent me his private box. The Opera-House was one of the first\r\nto be lighted by the incandescent lamp, and the managers took great\r\npleasure in showing me down through the labyrinth containing the\r\nwiring, dynamos, etc. When I came into the box, the orchestra played the\r\n'Star-Spangled Banner,' and all the people in the house arose; whereupon\r\nI was very much embarrassed. After I had been an hour at the play, the\r\nmanager came around and asked me to go underneath the stage, as they\r\nwere putting on a ballet of 300 girls, the finest ballet in Europe. It\r\nseems there is a little hole on the stage with a hood over it, in which\r\nthe prompter sits when opera is given. In this instance it was not\r\noccupied, and I was given the position in the prompter's seat, and saw\r\nthe whole ballet at close range.\r\n\r\n\"The city of Paris gave me a dinner at the new Hotel de Ville, which was\r\nalso lighted with the Edison system. They had a very fine installation\r\nof machinery. As I could not understand or speak a word of French,\r\nI went to see our minister, Mr. Whitelaw Reid, and got him to send a\r\ndeputy to answer for me, which he did, with my grateful thanks. Then the\r\ntelephone company gave me a dinner, and the engineers of France; and\r\nI attended the dinner celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\ndiscovery of photography. Then they sent to Reid my decoration, and they\r\ntried to put a sash on me, but I could not stand for that. My wife had\r\nme wear the little red button, but when I saw Americans coming I would\r\nslip it out of my lapel, as I thought they would jolly me for wearing\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nNor was this all. Edison naturally met many of the celebrities of\r\nFrance: \"I visited the Eiffel Tower at the invitation of Eiffel. We went\r\nto the top, where there was an extension and a small place in which was\r\nEiffel's private office. In this was a piano. When my wife and I arrived\r\nat the top, we found that Gounod, the composer, was there. We stayed a\r\ncouple of hours, and Gounod sang and played for us. We spent a day at\r\nMeudon, an old palace given by the government to Jansen, the astronomer.\r\nHe occupied three rooms, and there were 300. He had the grand\r\ndining-room for his laboratory. He showed me a gyroscope he had got\r\nup which made the incredible number of 4000 revolutions in a second. A\r\nmodification of this was afterward used on the French Atlantic lines for\r\nmaking an artificial horizon to take observations for position at\r\nsea. In connection with this a gentleman came to me a number of years\r\nafterward, and I got out a part of some plans for him. He wanted to make\r\na gigantic gyroscope weighing several tons, to be run by an electric\r\nmotor and put on a sailing ship. He wanted this gyroscope to keep a\r\nplatform perfectly horizontal, no matter how rough the sea was. Upon\r\nthis platform he was going to mount a telescope to observe an eclipse\r\noff the Gold Coast of Africa. But for some reason it was never\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\"Pasteur invited me to come down to the Institute, and I went and had\r\nquite a chat with him. I saw a large number of persons being inoculated,\r\nand also the whole modus operandi, which was very interesting. I saw one\r\nbeautiful boy about ten, the son of an English lord. His father was with\r\nhim. He had been bitten in the face, and was taking the treatment. I\r\nsaid to Pasteur, 'Will he live?' 'No,' said he, 'the boy will be dead in\r\nsix days. He was bitten too near the top of the spinal column, and came\r\ntoo late!'\"\r\n\r\nEdison has no opinion to offer as an expert on art, but has his own\r\nstandard of taste: \"Of course I visited the Louvre and saw the Old\r\nMasters, which I could not enjoy. And I attended the Luxembourg, with\r\nmodern masters, which I enjoyed greatly. To my mind, the Old Masters\r\nare not art, and I suspect that many others are of the same opinion;\r\nand that their value is in their scarcity and in the variety of men with\r\nlots of money.\" Somewhat akin to this is a shrewd comment on one feature\r\nof the Exposition: \"I spent several days in the Exposition at Paris. I\r\nremember going to the exhibit of the Kimberley diamond mines, and they\r\nkindly permitted me to take diamonds from some of the blue earth which\r\nthey were washing by machinery to exhibit the mine operations. I found\r\nseveral beautiful diamonds, but they seemed a little light weight to me\r\nwhen I was picking them out. They were diamonds for exhibition purposes\r\n--probably glass.\"\r\n\r\nThis did not altogether complete the European trip of 1889, for Edison\r\nwished to see Helmholtz. \"After leaving Paris we went to Berlin. The\r\nFrench papers then came out and attacked me because I went to Germany;\r\nand said I was now going over to the enemy. I visited all the things of\r\ninterest in Berlin; and then on my way home I went with Helmholtz\r\nand Siemens in a private compartment to the meeting of the German\r\nAssociation of Science at Heidelberg, and spent two days there. When\r\nI started from Berlin on the trip, I began to tell American stories.\r\nSiemens was very fond of these stories and would laugh immensely at\r\nthem, and could see the points and the humor, by his imagination; but\r\nHelmholtz could not see one of them. Siemens would quickly, in\r\nGerman, explain the point, but Helmholtz could not see it, although he\r\nunderstood English, which Siemens could speak. Still the explanations\r\nwere made in German. I always wished I could have understood Siemens's\r\nexplanations of the points of those stories. At Heidelberg, my\r\nassistant, Mr. Wangemann, an accomplished German-American, showed the\r\nphonograph before the Association.\"\r\n\r\nThen came the trip from the Continent to England, of which this will\r\ncertainly pass as a graphic picture: \"When I crossed over to England\r\nI had heard a good deal about the terrors of the English Channel as\r\nregards seasickness. I had been over the ocean three times and did not\r\nknow what seasickness was, so far as I was concerned myself. I was told\r\nthat while a man might not get seasick on the ocean, if he met a good\r\nstorm on the Channel it would do for him. When we arrived at Calais\r\nto cross over, everybody made for the restaurant. I did not care about\r\neating, and did not go to the restaurant, but my family did. I walked\r\nout and tried to find the boat. Going along the dock I saw two small\r\nsmokestacks sticking up, and looking down saw a little boat. 'Where is\r\nthe steamer that goes across the Channel?' 'This is the boat.' There had\r\nbeen a storm in the North Sea that had carried away some of the boats on\r\nthe German steamer, and it certainly looked awful tough outside. I said\r\nto the man: 'Will that boat live in that sea?' 'Oh yes,' he said, 'but\r\nwe've had a bad storm.' So I made up my mind that perhaps I would get\r\nsick this time. The managing director of the English railroad owning\r\nthis line was Forbes, who heard I was coming over, and placed the\r\nprivate saloon at my disposal. The moment my family got in the room with\r\nthe French lady's maid and the rest, they commenced to get sick, so I\r\nfelt pretty sure I was in for it. We started out of the little inlet\r\nand got into the Channel, and that boat went in seventeen directions\r\nsimultaneously. I waited awhile to see what was going to occur, and then\r\nwent into the smoking-compartment. Nobody was there. By-and-by the fun\r\nbegan. Sounds of all kinds and varieties were heard in every direction.\r\nThey were all sick. There must have been 100 people aboard. I didn't\r\nsee a single exception except the waiters and myself. I asked one of the\r\nwaiters concerning the boat itself, and was taken to see the engineer,\r\nand went down to look at the engines, and saw the captain. But I kept\r\nmostly in the smoking-room. I was smoking a big cigar, and when a man\r\nlooked in I would give a big puff, and every time they saw that they\r\nwould go away and begin again. The English Channel is a holy terror, all\r\nright, but it didn't affect me. I must be out of balance.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Paris, Edison had met Sir John Pender, the English \"cable\r\nking,\" and had received an invitation from him to make a visit to his\r\ncountry residence: \"Sir John Pender, the master of the cable system of\r\nthe world at that time, I met in Paris. I think he must have lived among\r\na lot of people who were very solemn, because I went out riding with\r\nhim in the Bois de Boulogne and started in to tell him American stories.\r\nAlthough he was a Scotchman he laughed immoderately. He had the faculty\r\nof understanding and quickly seeing the point of the stories; and\r\nfor three days after I could not get rid of him. Finally I made him\r\na promise that I would go to his country house at Foot's Cray, near\r\nLondon. So I went there, and spent two or three days telling him\r\nstories.\r\n\r\n\"While at Foot's Cray, I met some of the backers of Ferranti, then\r\nputting up a gigantic alternating-current dynamo near London to send\r\nten or fifteen thousand volts up into the main district of the city for\r\nelectric lighting. I think Pender was interested. At any rate the people\r\ninvited to dinner were very much interested, and they questioned me as\r\nto what I thought of the proposition. I said I hadn't any thought about\r\nit, and could not give any opinion until I saw it. So I was taken up\r\nto London to see the dynamo in course of construction and the methods\r\nemployed; and they insisted I should give them some expression of my\r\nviews. While I gave them my opinion, it was reluctantly; I did not want\r\nto do so. I thought that commercially the thing was too ambitious, that\r\nFerranti's ideas were too big, just then; that he ought to have started\r\na little smaller until he was sure. I understand that this installation\r\nwas not commercially successful, as there were a great many troubles.\r\nBut Ferranti had good ideas, and he was no small man.\"\r\n\r\nIncidentally it may be noted here that during the same year (1889) the\r\nvarious manufacturing Edison lighting interests in America were brought\r\ntogether, under the leadership of Mr. Henry Villard, and consolidated\r\nin the Edison General Electric Company with a capital of no less than\r\n$12,000,000 on an eight-per-cent.-dividend basis. The numerous Edison\r\ncentral stations all over the country represented much more than that\r\nsum, and made a splendid outlet for the product of the factories. A few\r\nyears later came the consolidation with the Thomson-Houston interests\r\nin the General Electric Company, which under the brilliant and vigorous\r\nmanagement of President C. A. Coffin has become one of the greatest\r\nmanufacturing institutions of the country, with an output of apparatus\r\nreaching toward $75,000,000 annually. The net result of both financial\r\noperations was, however, to detach Edison from the special field of\r\ninvention to which he had given so many of his most fruitful years; and\r\nto close very definitely that chapter of his life, leaving him free to\r\ndevelop other ideas and interests as set forth in these volumes.\r\n\r\nIt might appear strange on the surface, but one of the reasons that most\r\ninfluenced Edison to regrets in connection with the \"big trade\" of 1889\r\nwas that it separated him from his old friend and ally, Bergmann, who,\r\non selling out, saw a great future for himself in Germany, went\r\nthere, and realized it. Edison has always had an amused admiration for\r\nBergmann, and his \"social side\" is often made evident by his love of\r\ntelling stories about those days of struggle. Some of the stories were\r\ntold for this volume. \"Bergmann came to work for me as a boy,\" says\r\nEdison. \"He started in on stock-quotation printers. As he was a rapid\r\nworkman and paid no attention to the clock, I took a fancy to him, and\r\ngave him piece-work. He contrived so many little tools to cheapen the\r\nwork that he made lots of money. I even helped him get up tools until\r\nit occurred to me that this was too rapid a process of getting rid of\r\nmy money, as I hadn't the heart to cut the price when it was originally\r\nfair. After a year or so, Bergmann got enough money to start a small\r\nshop in Wooster Street, New York, and it was at this shop that the\r\nfirst phonographs were made for sale. Then came the carbon telephone\r\ntransmitter, a large number of which were made by Bergmann for the\r\nWestern Union. Finally came the electric light. A dynamo was installed\r\nin Bergmann's shop to permit him to test the various small devices which\r\nhe was then making for the system. He rented power from a Jew who owned\r\nthe building. Power was supplied from a fifty-horse-power engine to\r\nother tenants on the several floors. Soon after the introduction of the\r\nbig dynamo machine, the landlord appeared in the shop and insisted that\r\nBergmann was using more power than he was paying for, and said that\r\nlately the belt on the engine was slipping and squealing. Bergmann\r\nmaintained that he must be mistaken. The landlord kept going among his\r\ntenants and finally discovered the dynamo. 'Oh! Mr. Bergmann, now I know\r\nwhere my power goes to,' pointing to the dynamo. Bergmann gave him a\r\nwithering look of scorn, and said, 'Come here and I will show you.'\r\nThrowing off the belt and disconnecting the wires, he spun the armature\r\naround by hand. 'There,' said Bergmann, 'you see it's not here that you\r\nmust look for your loss.' This satisfied the landlord, and he started\r\noff to his other tenants. He did not know that that machine, when the\r\nwires were connected, could stop his engine.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after, the business had grown so large that E. H. Johnson and I\r\nwent in as partners, and Bergmann rented an immense factory building\r\nat the corner of Avenue B and East Seventeenth Street, New York, six\r\nstories high and covering a quarter of a block. Here were made all the\r\nsmall things used on the electric-lighting system, such as sockets,\r\nchandeliers, switches, meters, etc. In addition, stock tickers,\r\ntelephones, telephone switchboards, and typewriters were made the\r\nHammond typewriters were perfected and made there. Over 1500 men were\r\nfinally employed. This shop was very successful both scientifically and\r\nfinancially. Bergmann was a man of great executive ability and carried\r\neconomy of manufacture to the limit. Among all the men I have had\r\nassociated with me, he had the commercial instinct most highly\r\ndeveloped.\"\r\n\r\nOne need not wonder at Edison's reminiscent remark that, \"In any trade\r\nany of my 'boys' made with Bergmann he always got the best of them,\r\nno matter what it was. One time there was to be a convention of the\r\nmanagers of Edison illuminating companies at Chicago. There were a lot\r\nof representatives from the East, and a private car was hired. At Jersey\r\nCity a poker game was started by one of the delegates. Bergmann was\r\ninduced to enter the game. This was played right through to Chicago\r\nwithout any sleep, but the boys didn't mind that. I had gotten them\r\nimmune to it. Bergmann had won all the money, and when the porter came\r\nin and said 'Chicago,' Bergmann jumped up and said: 'What! Chicago! I\r\nthought it was only Philadelphia!'\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps this further story is a better indication of developed humor\r\nand shrewdness: \"A man by the name of Epstein had been in the habit\r\nof buying brass chips and trimmings from the lathes, and in some way\r\nBergmann found out that he had been cheated. This hurt his pride, and\r\nhe determined to get even. One day Epstein appeared and said:\r\n'Good-morning, Mr. Bergmann, have you any chips to-day?' 'No,' said\r\nBergmann, 'I have none.' 'That's strange, Mr. Bergmann; won't you\r\nlook?' No, he wouldn't look; he knew he had none. Finally Epstein was so\r\npersistent that Bergmann called an assistant and told him to go and\r\nsee if he had any chips. He returned and said they had the largest and\r\nfinest lot they ever had. Epstein went up to several boxes piled full of\r\nchips, and so heavy that he could not lift even one end of a box. 'Now,\r\nMr. Bergmann,' said Epstein, 'how much for the lot?' 'Epstein,' said\r\nBergmann, 'you have cheated me, and I will no longer sell by the lot,\r\nbut will sell only by the pound.' No amount of argument would apparently\r\nchange Bergmann's determination to sell by the pound, but finally\r\nEpstein got up to $250 for the lot, and Bergmann, appearing as if\r\ndisgusted, accepted and made him count out the money. Then he said:\r\n'Well, Epstein, good-bye, I've got to go down to Wall Street.' Epstein\r\nand his assistant then attempted to lift the boxes to carry them out,\r\nbut couldn't; and then discovered that calculations as to quantity had\r\nbeen thrown out because the boxes had all been screwed down to the floor\r\nand mostly filled with boards with a veneer of brass chips. He made such\r\na scene that he had to be removed by the police. I met him several days\r\nafterward and he said he had forgiven Mr. Bergmann, as he was such a\r\nsmart business man, and the scheme was so ingenious.\r\n\r\n\"One day as a joke I filled three or four sheets of foolscap paper with\r\na jumble of figures and told Bergmann they were calculations showing the\r\ngreat loss of power from blowing the factory whistle. Bergmann thought\r\nit real, and never after that would he permit the whistle to blow.\"\r\n\r\nAnother glimpse of the \"social side\" is afforded in the following little\r\nseries of pen-pictures of the same place and time: \"I had my laboratory\r\nat the top of the Bergmann works, after moving from Menlo Park. The\r\nbuilding was six stories high. My father came there when he was eighty\r\nyears of age. The old man had powerful lungs. In fact, when I was\r\nexamined by the Mutual Life Insurance Company, in 1873, my lung\r\nexpansion was taken by the doctor, and the old gentleman was there\r\nat the time. He said to the doctor: 'I wish you would take my lung\r\nexpansion, too.' The doctor took it, and his surprise was very great,\r\nas it was one of the largest on record. I think it was five and one-half\r\ninches. There were only three or four could beat it. Little Bergmann\r\nhadn't much lung power. The old man said to him, one day: 'Let's run\r\nup-stairs.' Bergmann agreed and ran up. When they got there Bergmann\r\nwas all done up, but my father never showed a sign of it. There was an\r\nelevator there, and each day while it was travelling up I held the stem\r\nof my Waterbury watch up against the column in the elevator shaft and\r\nit finished the winding by the time I got up the six stories.\" This\r\noriginal method of reducing the amount of physical labor involved in\r\nwatch-winding brings to mind another instance of shrewdness mentioned by\r\nEdison, with regard to his newsboy days. Being asked whether he did not\r\nget imposed upon with bad bank-bills, he replied that he subscribed to a\r\nbank-note detector and consulted it closely whenever a note of any size\r\nfell into his hands. He was then less than fourteen years old.\r\n\r\nThe conversations with Edison that elicited these stories brought out\r\nsome details as to peril that attends experimentation. He has confronted\r\nmany a serious physical risk, and counts himself lucky to have come\r\nthrough without a scratch or scar. Four instances of personal danger\r\nmay be noted in his own language: \"When I started at Menlo, I had an\r\nelectric furnace for welding rare metals that I did not know about\r\nvery clearly. I was in the dark-room, where I had a lot of chloride of\r\nsulphur, a very corrosive liquid. I did not know that it would decompose\r\nby water. I poured in a beakerful of water, and the whole thing exploded\r\nand threw a lot of it into my eyes. I ran to the hydrant, leaned over\r\nbackward, opened my eyes, and ran the hydrant water right into them. But\r\nit was two weeks before I could see.\r\n\r\n\"The next time we just saved ourselves. I was making some stuff to\r\nsquirt into filaments for the incandescent lamp. I made about a pound of\r\nit. I had used ammonia and bromine. I did not know it at the time, but\r\nI had made bromide of nitrogen. I put the large bulk of it in three\r\nfilters, and after it had been washed and all the water had come through\r\nthe filter, I opened the three filters and laid them on a hot steam\r\nplate to dry with the stuff. While I and Mr. Sadler, one of my\r\nassistants, were working near it, there was a sudden flash of light,\r\nand a very smart explosion. I said to Sadler: 'What is that?' 'I don't\r\nknow,' he said, and we paid no attention. In about half a minute there\r\nwas a sharp concussion, and Sadler said: 'See, it is that stuff on the\r\nsteam plate.' I grabbed the whole thing and threw it in the sink, and\r\npoured water on it. I saved a little of it and found it was a terrific\r\nexplosive. The reason why those little preliminary explosions took place\r\nwas that a little had spattered out on the edge of the filter paper,\r\nand had dried first and exploded. Had the main body exploded there would\r\nhave been nothing left of the laboratory I was working in.\r\n\r\n\"At another time, I had a briquetting machine for briquetting iron ore.\r\nI had a lever held down by a powerful spring, and a rod one inch in\r\ndiameter and four feet long. While I was experimenting with it, and\r\nstanding beside it, a washer broke, and that spring threw the rod right\r\nup to the ceiling with a blast; and it came down again just within\r\nan inch of my nose, and went clear through a two-inch plank. That was\r\n'within an inch of your life,' as they say.\r\n\r\n\"In my experimental plant for concentrating iron ore in the northern\r\npart of New Jersey, we had a vertical drier, a column about nine feet\r\nsquare and eighty feet high. At the bottom there was a space where two\r\nmen could go through a hole; and then all the rest of the column was\r\nfilled with baffle plates. One day this drier got blocked, and the ore\r\nwould not run down. So I and the vice-president of the company, Mr.\r\nMallory, crowded through the manhole to see why the ore would not come\r\ndown. After we got in, the ore did come down and there were fourteen\r\ntons of it above us. The men outside knew we were in there, and they had\r\na great time digging us out and getting air to us.\"\r\n\r\nSuch incidents brought out in narration the fact that many of the men\r\nworking with him had been less fortunate, particularly those who had\r\nexperimented with the Roentgen X-ray, whose ravages, like those of\r\nleprosy, were responsible for the mutilation and death of at least one\r\nexpert assistant. In the early days of work on the incandescent lamp,\r\nalso, there was considerable trouble with mercury. \"I had a series of\r\nvacuum-pumps worked by mercury and used for exhausting experimental\r\nincandescent lamps. The main pipe, which was full of mercury, was about\r\nseven and one-half feet from the floor. Along the length of the pipe\r\nwere outlets to which thick rubber tubing was connected, each tube to a\r\npump. One day, while experimenting with the mercury pump, my assistant,\r\nan awkward country lad from a farm on Staten Island, who had adenoids in\r\nhis nose and breathed through his mouth, which was always wide open,\r\nwas looking up at this pipe, at a small leak of mercury, when the rubber\r\ntube came off and probably two pounds of mercury went into his mouth and\r\ndown his throat, and got through his system somehow. In a short time he\r\nbecame salivated, and his teeth got loose. He went home, and shortly his\r\nmother appeared at the laboratory with a horsewhip, which she proposed\r\nto use on the proprietor. I was fortunately absent, and she was\r\nmollified somehow by my other assistants. I had given the boy\r\nconsiderable iodide of potassium to prevent salivation, but it did no\r\ngood in this case.\r\n\r\n\"When the first lamp-works were started at Menlo Park, one of my\r\nexperiments seemed to show that hot mercury gave a better vacuum in the\r\nlamp than cold mercury. I thereupon started to heat it. Soon all the men\r\ngot salivated, and things looked serious; but I found that in the mirror\r\nfactories, where mercury was used extensively, the French Government\r\nmade the giving of iodide of potassium compulsory to prevent salivation.\r\nI carried out this idea, and made every man take a dose every day, but\r\nthere was great opposition, and hot mercury was finally abandoned.\"\r\n\r\nIt will have been gathered that Edison has owed his special immunity\r\nfrom \"occupational diseases\" not only to luck but to unusual powers of\r\nendurance, and a strong physique, inherited, no doubt, from his father.\r\nMr. Mallory mentions a little fact that bears on this exceptional\r\nquality of bodily powers. \"I have often been surprised at Edison's\r\nwonderful capacity for the instant visual perception of differences in\r\nmaterials that were invisible to others until he would patiently point\r\nthem out. This had puzzled me for years, but one day I was unexpectedly\r\nlet into part of the secret. For some little time past Mr. Edison had\r\nnoticed that he was bothered somewhat in reading print, and I asked him\r\nto have an oculist give him reading-glasses. He partially promised, but\r\nnever took time to attend to it. One day he and I were in the city, and\r\nas Mrs. Edison had spoken to me about it, and as we happened to have\r\nan hour to spare, I persuaded him to go to an oculist with me. Using\r\nno names, I asked the latter to examine the gentleman's eyes. He did so\r\nvery conscientiously, and it was an interesting experience, for he was\r\nkept busy answering Mr. Edison's numerous questions. When the oculist\r\nfinished, he turned to me and said: 'I have been many years in\r\nthe business, but have never seen an optic nerve like that of this\r\ngentleman. An ordinary optic nerve is about the thickness of a thread,\r\nbut his is like a cord. He must be a remarkable man in some walk of\r\nlife. Who is he?'\"\r\n\r\nIt has certainly required great bodily vigor and physical capacity to\r\nsustain such fatigue as Edison has all his life imposed upon himself,\r\nto the extent on one occasion of going five days without sleep. In a\r\nconversation during 1909, he remarked, as though it were nothing out of\r\nthe way, that up to seven years previously his average of daily working\r\nhours was nineteen and one-half, but that since then he figured it\r\nat eighteen. He said he stood it easily, because he was interested in\r\neverything, and was reading and studying all the time. For instance,\r\nhe had gone to bed the night before exactly at twelve and had arisen at\r\n4.30 A. M. to read some New York law reports. It was suggested that the\r\nsecret of it might be that he did not live in the past, but was always\r\nlooking forward to a greater future, to which he replied: \"Yes, that's\r\nit. I don't live with the past; I am living for to-day and to-morrow. I\r\nam interested in every department of science, arts, and manufacture.\r\nI read all the time on astronomy, chemistry, biology, physics,\r\nmusic, metaphysics, mechanics, and other branches--political economy,\r\nelectricity, and, in fact, all things that are making for progress in\r\nthe world. I get all the proceedings of the scientific societies, the\r\nprincipal scientific and trade journals, and read them. I also read The\r\nClipper, The Police Gazette, The Billboard, The Dramatic Mirror, and\r\na lot of similar publications, for I like to know what is going on. In\r\nthis way I keep up to date, and live in a great moving world of my own,\r\nand, what's more, I enjoy every minute of it.\" Referring to some event\r\nof the past, he said: \"Spilt milk doesn't interest me. I have spilt lots\r\nof it, and while I have always felt it for a few days, it is quickly\r\nforgotten, and I turn again to the future.\" During another talk on\r\nkindred affairs it was suggested to Edison that, as he had worked so\r\nhard all his life, it was about time for him to think somewhat of the\r\npleasures of travel and the social side of life. To which he replied\r\nlaughingly: \"I already have a schedule worked out. From now until I am\r\nseventy-five years of age, I expect to keep more or less busy with my\r\nregular work, not, however, working as many hours or as hard as I have\r\nin the past. At seventy five I expect to wear loud waistcoats with\r\nfancy buttons; also gaiter tops; at eighty I expect to learn how to play\r\nbridge whist and talk foolishly to the ladies. At eighty-five I expect\r\nto wear a full-dress suit every evening at dinner, and at ninety--well,\r\nI never plan more than thirty years ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference to clothes is interesting, as it is one of the few\r\nsubjects in which Edison has no interest. It rather bores him. His dress\r\nis always of the plainest; in fact, so plain that, at the Bergmann shops\r\nin New York, the children attending a parochial Catholic school were\r\nwont to salute him with the finger to the head, every time he went by.\r\nUpon inquiring, he found that they took him for a priest, with his dark\r\ngarb, smooth-shaven face, and serious expression. Edison says: \"I get\r\na suit that fits me; then I compel the tailors to use that as a jig or\r\npattern or blue-print to make others by. For many years a suit was used\r\nas a measurement; once or twice they took fresh measurements, but these\r\ndidn't fit and they had to go back. I eat to keep my weight constant,\r\nhence I need never change measurements.\" In regard to this, Mr. Mallory\r\nfurnishes a bit of chat as follows: \"In a lawsuit in which I was a\r\nwitness, I went out to lunch with the lawyers on both sides, and the\r\nlawyer who had been cross-examining me stated that he had for a client\r\na Fifth Avenue tailor, who had told him that he had made all of Mr.\r\nEdison's clothes for the last twenty years, and that he had never seen\r\nhim. He said that some twenty years ago a suit was sent to him from\r\nOrange, and measurements were made from it, and that every suit since\r\nhad been made from these measurements. I may add, from my own personal\r\nobservation, that in Mr. Edison's clothes there is no evidence but that\r\nevery new suit that he has worn in that time looks as if he had been\r\nspecially measured for it, which shows how very little he has changed\r\nphysically in the last twenty years.\"\r\n\r\nEdison has never had any taste for amusements, although he will indulge\r\nin the game of \"Parchesi\" and has a billiard-table in his house. The\r\ncoming of the automobile was a great boon to him, because it gave him\r\na form of outdoor sport in which he could indulge in a spirit of\r\nobservation, without the guilty feeling that he was wasting valuable\r\ntime. In his automobile he has made long tours, and with his family has\r\nparticularly indulged his taste for botany. That he has had the usual\r\nexperience in running machines will be evidenced by the following little\r\nstory from Mr. Mallory: \"About three years ago I had a motor-car of\r\na make of which Mr. Edison had already two cars; and when the car was\r\nreceived I made inquiry as to whether any repair parts were carried\r\nby any of the various garages in Easton, Pennsylvania, near our cement\r\nworks. I learned that this particular car was the only one in Easton.\r\nKnowing that Mr. Edison had had an experience lasting two or three\r\nyears with this particular make of car, I determined to ask him for\r\ninformation relative to repair parts; so the next time I was at the\r\nlaboratory I told him I was unable to get any repair parts in Easton,\r\nand that I wished to order some of the most necessary, so that, in case\r\nof breakdowns, I would not be compelled to lose the use of the car for\r\nseveral days until the parts came from the automobile factory. I asked\r\nhis advice as to what I should order, to which he replied: 'I don't\r\nthink it will be necessary to order an extra top.'\" Since that episode,\r\nwhich will probably be appreciated by most automobilists, Edison\r\nhas taken up the electric automobile, and is now using it as well as\r\ndeveloping it. One of the cars equipped with his battery is the Bailey,\r\nand Mr. Bee tells the following story in regard to it: \"One day Colonel\r\nBailey, of Amesbury, Massachusetts, who was visiting the Automobile Show\r\nin New York, came out to the laboratory to see Mr. Edison, as the\r\nlatter had expressed a desire to talk with him on his next visit to the\r\nmetropolis. When he arrived at the laboratory, Mr. Edison, who had been\r\nup all night experimenting, was asleep on the cot in the library. As\r\na rule we never wake Mr. Edison from sleep, but as he wanted to see\r\nColonel Bailey, who had to go, I felt that an exception should be made,\r\nso I went and tapped him on the shoulder. He awoke at once, smiling,\r\njumped up, was instantly himself as usual, and advanced and greeted the\r\nvisitor. His very first question was: 'Well, Colonel, how did you come\r\nout on that experiment?'--referring to some suggestions he had made at\r\ntheir last meeting a year before. For a minute Colonel Bailey did not\r\nrecall what was referred to; but a few words from Mr. Edison brought it\r\nback to his remembrance, and he reported that the results had justified\r\nMr. Edison's expectations.\"\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that Edison would have extreme and even radical\r\nideas on the subject of education--and he has, as well as a perfect\r\nreadiness to express them, because he considers that time is wasted on\r\nthings that are not essential: \"What we need,\" he has said, \"are men\r\ncapable of doing work. I wouldn't give a penny for the ordinary college\r\ngraduate, except those from the institutes of technology. Those coming\r\nup from the ranks are a darned sight better than the others. They aren't\r\nfilled up with Latin, philosophy, and the rest of that ninny stuff.\" A\r\nfurther remark of his is: \"What the country needs now is the practical\r\nskilled engineer, who is capable of doing everything. In three or four\r\ncenturies, when the country is settled, and commercialism is diminished,\r\nthere will be time for the literary men. At present we want engineers,\r\nindustrial men, good business-like managers, and railroad men.\" It is\r\nhardly to be marvelled at that such views should elicit warm protest,\r\nsummed up in the comment: \"Mr. Edison and many like him see in reverse\r\nthe course of human progress. Invention does not smooth the way for the\r\npractical men and make them possible. There is always too much danger\r\nof neglecting thoughts for things, ideas for machinery. No theory\r\nof education that aggravates this danger is consistent with national\r\nwell-being.\"\r\n\r\nEdison is slow to discuss the great mysteries of life, but is of\r\nreverential attitude of mind, and ever tolerant of others' beliefs. He\r\nis not a religious man in the sense of turning to forms and creeds, but,\r\nas might be expected, is inclined as an inventor and creator to argue\r\nfrom the basis of \"design\" and thence to infer a designer. \"After years\r\nof watching the processes of nature,\" he says, \"I can no more doubt the\r\nexistence of an Intelligence that is running things than I do of the\r\nexistence of myself. Take, for example, the substance water that forms\r\nthe crystals known as ice. Now, there are hundreds of combinations that\r\nform crystals, and every one of them, save ice, sinks in water. Ice, I\r\nsay, doesn't, and it is rather lucky for us mortals, for if it had done\r\nso, we would all be dead. Why? Simply because if ice sank to the bottoms\r\nof rivers, lakes, and oceans as fast as it froze, those places would be\r\nfrozen up and there would be no water left. That is only one example\r\nout of thousands that to me prove beyond the possibility of a doubt that\r\nsome vast Intelligence is governing this and other planets.\"\r\n\r\nA few words as to the domestic and personal side of Edison's life, to\r\nwhich many incidental references have already been made in these pages.\r\nHe was married in 1873 to Miss Mary Stillwell, who died in 1884, leaving\r\nthree children--Thomas Alva, William Leslie, and Marion Estelle.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison was married again in 1886 to Miss Mina Miller, daughter of\r\nMr. Lewis Miller, a distinguished pioneer inventor and manufacturer in\r\nthe field of agricultural machinery, and equally entitled to fame as the\r\nfather of the \"Chautauqua idea,\" and the founder with Bishop Vincent\r\nof the original Chautauqua, which now has so many replicas all over the\r\ncountry, and which started in motion one of the great modern educational\r\nand moral forces in America. By this marriage there are three\r\nchildren--Charles, Madeline, and Theodore.\r\n\r\nFor over a score of years, dating from his marriage to Miss Miller,\r\nEdison's happy and perfect domestic life has been spent at Glenmont,\r\na beautiful property acquired at that time in Llewellyn Park, on the\r\nhigher slopes of Orange Mountain, New Jersey, within easy walking\r\ndistance of the laboratory at the foot of the hill in West Orange. As\r\nnoted already, the latter part of each winter is spent at Fort Myers,\r\nFlorida, where Edison has, on the banks of the Calahoutchie River, a\r\nplantation home that is in many ways a miniature copy of the home and\r\nlaboratory up North. Glenmont is a rather elaborate and florid building\r\nin Queen Anne English style, of brick, stone, and wooden beams showing\r\non the exterior, with an abundance of gables and balconies. It is set in\r\nan environment of woods and sweeps of lawn, flanked by unusually large\r\nconservatories, and always bright in summer with glowing flower beds. It\r\nwould be difficult to imagine Edison in a stiffly formal house, and this\r\nbig, cozy, three-story, rambling mansion has an easy freedom about it,\r\nwithout and within, quite in keeping with the genius of the inventor,\r\nbut revealing at every turn traces of feminine taste and culture. The\r\nground floor, consisting chiefly of broad drawing-rooms, parlors, and\r\ndining-hall, is chiefly noteworthy for the \"den,\" or lounging-room, at\r\nthe end of the main axis, where the family and friends are likely to\r\nbe found in the evening hours, unless the party has withdrawn for more\r\nintimate social intercourse to the interesting and fascinating private\r\nlibrary on the floor above. The lounging-room on the ground floor is\r\nmore or less of an Edison museum, for it is littered with souvenirs from\r\ngreat people, and with mementos of travel, all related to some event\r\nor episode. A large cabinet contains awards, decorations, and medals\r\npresented to Edison, accumulating in the course of a long career,\r\nsome of which may be seen in the illustration opposite. Near by may be\r\nnoticed a bronze replica of the Edison gold medal which was founded in\r\nthe American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the first award of which\r\nwas made to Elihu Thomson during the present year (1910). There are\r\nstatues of serpentine marble, gifts of the late Tsar of Russia, whose\r\nadmiration is also represented by a gorgeous inlaid and enamelled\r\ncigar-case.\r\n\r\nThere are typical bronze vases from the Society of Engineers of Japan,\r\nand a striking desk-set of writing apparatus from Krupp, all the pieces\r\nbeing made out of tiny but massive guns and shells of Krupp steel. In\r\naddition to such bric-a-brac and bibelots of all kinds are many pictures\r\nand photographs, including the original sketches of the reception given\r\nto Edison in 1889 by the Paris Figaro, and a letter from Madame Carnot,\r\nplacing the Presidential opera-box at the disposal of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nEdison. One of the most conspicuous features of the room is a phonograph\r\nequipment on which the latest and best productions by the greatest\r\nsingers and musicians can always be heard, but which Edison himself is\r\neverlastingly experimenting with, under the incurable delusion that this\r\ndomestic retreat is but an extension of his laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe big library--semi-boudoir--up-stairs is also very expressive of the\r\nhome life of Edison, but again typical of his nature and disposition,\r\nfor it is difficult to overlay his many technical books and scientific\r\nperiodicals with a sufficiently thick crust of popular magazines or\r\ncurrent literature to prevent their outcropping into evidence. In like\r\nmanner the chat and conversation here, however lightly it may begin,\r\nturns invariably to large questions and deep problems, especially in the\r\nfields of discovery and invention; and Edison, in an easy-chair, will\r\nsit through the long evenings till one or two in the morning, pulling\r\nmeditatively at his eyebrows, quoting something he has just read\r\npertinent to the discussion, hearing and telling new stories with gusto,\r\noffering all kinds of ingenious suggestions, and without fail getting\r\nhold of pads and sheets of paper on which to make illustrative sketches.\r\nHe is wonderfully handy with the pencil, and will sometimes amuse\r\nhimself, while chatting, with making all kinds of fancy bits of\r\npenmanship, twisting his signature into circles and squares, but always\r\nwriting straight lines--so straight they could not be ruled truer. Many\r\na night it is a question of getting Edison to bed, for he would much\r\nrather probe a problem than eat or sleep; but at whatever hour the\r\nvisitor retires or gets up, he is sure to find the master of the house\r\non hand, serene and reposeful, and just as brisk at dawn as when he\r\nallowed the conversation to break up at midnight. The ordinary routine\r\nof daily family life is of course often interrupted by receptions and\r\nparties, visits to the billiard-room, the entertainment of visitors, the\r\ndeparture to and return from college, at vacation periods, of the young\r\npeople, and matters relating to the many social and philanthropic causes\r\nin which Mrs. Edison is actively interested; but, as a matter of fact,\r\nEdison's round of toil and relaxation is singularly uniform and free\r\nfrom agitation, and that is the way he would rather have it.\r\n\r\nEdison at sixty-three has a fine physique, and being free from serious\r\nailments of any kind, should carry on the traditions of his long-lived\r\nancestors as to a vigorous old age. His hair has whitened, but is still\r\nthick and abundant, and though he uses glasses for certain work, his\r\ngray-blue eyes are as keen and bright and deeply lustrous as ever, with\r\nthe direct, searching look in them that they have ever worn. He\r\nstands five feet nine and one-half inches high, weighs one hundred and\r\nseventy-five pounds, and has not varied as to weight in a quarter of a\r\ncentury, although as a young man he was slim to gauntness. He is very\r\nabstemious, hardly ever touching alcohol, caring little for meat, but\r\nfond of fruit, and never averse to a strong cup of coffee or a good\r\ncigar. He takes extremely little exercise, although his good color and\r\nquickness of step would suggest to those who do not know better that he\r\nis in the best of training, and one who lives in the open air.\r\n\r\nHis simplicity as to clothes has already been described. One would be\r\nstartled to see him with a bright tie, a loud checked suit, or a fancy\r\nwaistcoat, and yet there is a curious sense of fastidiousness about\r\nthe plain things he delights in. Perhaps he is not wholly responsible\r\npersonally for this state of affairs. In conversation Edison is direct,\r\ncourteous, ready to discuss a topic with anybody worth talking to, and,\r\nin spite of his sore deafness, an excellent listener. No one ever goes\r\naway from Edison in doubt as to what he thinks or means, but he is ever\r\nshy and diffident to a degree if the talk turns on himself rather than\r\non his work.\r\n\r\nIf the authors were asked, after having written the foregoing pages,\r\nto explain here the reason for Edison's success, based upon their\r\nobservations so far made, they would first answer that he combines with\r\na vigorous and normal physical structure a mind capable of clear and\r\nlogical thinking, and an imagination of unusual activity. But this would\r\nby no means offer a complete explanation. There are many men of\r\nequal bodily and mental vigor who have not achieved a tithe of\r\nhis accomplishment. What other factors are there to be taken into\r\nconsideration to explain this phenomenon? First, a stolid, almost\r\nphlegmatic, nervous system which takes absolutely no notice of ennui--a\r\nsystem like that of a Chinese ivory-carver who works day after day and\r\nmonth after month on a piece of material no larger than your hand. No\r\nbetter illustration of this characteristic can be found than in the\r\ndevelopment of the nickel pocket for the storage battery, an element the\r\nsize of a short lead-pencil, on which upward of five years were spent\r\nin experiments, costing over a million dollars, day after day, always\r\napparently with the same tubes but with small variations carefully\r\ntabulated in the note-books. To an ordinary person the mere sight of\r\nsuch a tube would have been as distasteful, certainly after a week or\r\nso, as the smell of a quail to a man striving to eat one every day for a\r\nmonth, near the end of his gastronomic ordeal. But to Edison these small\r\nperforated steel tubes held out as much of a fascination at the end of\r\nfive years as when the search was first begun, and every morning found\r\nhim as eager to begin the investigation anew as if the battery was an\r\nabsolutely novel problem to which his thoughts had just been directed.\r\n\r\nAnother and second characteristic of Edison's personality contributing\r\nso strongly to his achievements is an intense, not to say courageous,\r\noptimism in which no thought of failure can enter, an optimism born of\r\nself-confidence, and becoming--after forty or fifty years of experience\r\nmore and more a sense of certainty in the accomplishment of success. In\r\nthe overcoming of difficulties he has the same intellectual pleasure\r\nas the chess-master when confronted with a problem requiring all the\r\nefforts of his skill and experience to solve. To advance along smooth\r\nand pleasant paths, to encounter no obstacles, to wrestle with no\r\ndifficulties and hardships--such has absolutely no fascination to him.\r\nHe meets obstruction with the keen delight of a strong man battling with\r\nthe waves and opposing them in sheer enjoyment, and the greater and more\r\napparently overwhelming the forces that may tend to sweep him back, the\r\nmore vigorous his own efforts to forge through them. At the conclusion\r\nof the ore-milling experiments, when practically his entire fortune was\r\nsunk in an enterprise that had to be considered an impossibility, when\r\nat the age of fifty he looked back upon five or six years of intense\r\nactivity expended apparently for naught, when everything seemed most\r\nblack and the financial clouds were quickly gathering on the horizon,\r\nnot the slightest idea of repining entered his mind. The main experiment\r\nhad succeeded--he had accomplished what he sought for. Nature at another\r\npoint had outstripped him, yet he had broadened his own sum of knowledge\r\nto a prodigious extent. It was only during the past summer (1910) that\r\none of the writers spent a Sunday with him riding over the beautiful\r\nNew Jersey roads in an automobile, Edison in the highest spirits and\r\npointing out with the keenest enjoyment the many beautiful views of\r\nvalley and wood. The wanderings led to the old ore-milling plant at\r\nEdison, now practically a mass of deserted buildings all going to decay.\r\nIt was a depressing sight, marking such titanic but futile struggles\r\nwith nature. To Edison, however, no trace of sentiment or regret\r\noccurred, and the whole ruins were apparently as much a matter of\r\nunconcern as if he were viewing the remains of Pompeii. Sitting on the\r\nporch of the White House, where he lived during that period, in the\r\nlight of the setting sun, his fine face in repose, he looked as placidly\r\nover the scene as a happy farmer over a field of ripening corn. All that\r\nhe said was: \"I never felt better in my life than during the five years\r\nI worked here. Hard work, nothing to divert my thought, clear air and\r\nsimple food made my life very pleasant. We learned a great deal. It will\r\nbe of benefit to some one some time.\" Similarly, in connection with the\r\nstorage battery, after having experimented continuously for three years,\r\nit was found to fall below his expectations, and its manufacture had\r\nto be stopped. Hundreds of thousands of dollars had been spent on the\r\nexperiments, and, largely without Edison's consent, the battery had been\r\nvery generally exploited in the press. To stop meant not only to pocket\r\na great loss already incurred, facing a dark and uncertain future, but\r\nto most men animated by ordinary human feelings, it meant more than\r\nanything else, an injury to personal pride. Pride? Pooh! that had\r\nnothing to do with the really serious practical problem, and the writers\r\ncan testify that at the moment when his decision was reached, work\r\nstopped and the long vista ahead was peered into, Edison was as little\r\nconcerned as if he had concluded that, after all, perhaps peach-pie\r\nmight be better for present diet than apple-pie. He has often said that\r\ntime meant very little to him, that he had but a small realization\r\nof its passage, and that ten or twenty years were as nothing when\r\nconsidering the development of a vital invention.\r\n\r\nThese references to personal pride recall another characteristic of\r\nEdison wherein he differs from most men. There are many individuals\r\nwho derive an intense and not improper pleasure in regalia or military\r\ngarments, with plenty of gold braid and brass buttons, and thus arrayed,\r\nin appearing before their friends and neighbors. Putting at the head of\r\nthe procession the man who makes his appeal to public attention solely\r\nbecause of the brilliancy of his plumage, and passing down the ranks\r\nthrough the multitudes having a gradually decreasing sense of vanity in\r\ntheir personal accomplishment, Edison would be placed at the very end.\r\nReference herein has been made to the fact that one of the two great\r\nEnglish universities wished to confer a degree upon him, but that he\r\nwas unable to leave his work for the brief time necessary to accept the\r\nhonor. At that occasion it was pointed out to him that he should make\r\nevery possible sacrifice to go, that the compliment was great, and that\r\nbut few Americans had been so recognized. It was hopeless--an\r\nappeal based on sentiment. Before him was something real--work to be\r\naccomplished--a problem to be solved. Beyond, was a prize as intangible\r\nas the button of the Legion of Honor, which he concealed from his\r\nfriends that they might not feel he was \"showing off.\" The fact is that\r\nEdison cares little for the approval of the world, but that he cares\r\neverything for the approval of himself. Difficult as it may be--perhaps\r\nimpossible--to trace its origin, Edison possesses what he would probably\r\ncall a well-developed case of New England conscience, for whose approval\r\nhe is incessantly occupied.\r\n\r\nThese, then, may be taken as the characteristics of Edison that have\r\nenabled him to accomplish more than most men--a strong body, a clear\r\nand active mind, a developed imagination, a capacity of great mental and\r\nphysical concentration, an iron-clad nervous system that knows no ennui,\r\nintense optimism, and courageous self-confidence. Any one having these\r\ncapacities developed to the same extent, with the same opportunities for\r\nuse, would probably accomplish as much. And yet there is a peculiarity\r\nabout him that so far as is known has never been referred to before in\r\nprint. He seems to be conscientiously afraid of appearing indolent,\r\nand in consequence subjects himself regularly to unnecessary hardship.\r\nWorking all night is seldom necessary, or until two or three o'clock in\r\nthe morning, yet even now he persists in such tests upon his strength.\r\nRecently one of the writers had occasion to present to him a long\r\ntypewritten document of upward of thirty pages for his approval. It\r\nwas taken home to Glenmont. Edison had a few minor corrections to make,\r\nprobably not more than a dozen all told. They could have been embodied\r\nby interlineations and marginal notes in the ordinary way, and certainly\r\nwould not have required more than ten or fifteen minutes of his time.\r\nYet what did he do? HE COPIED OUT PAINSTAKINGLY THE ENTIRE PAPER IN\r\nLONG HAND, embodying the corrections as he went along, and presented the\r\nresult of his work the following morning. At the very least such a task\r\nmust have occupied several hours. How can such a trait--and scores of\r\nsimilar experiences could be given--be explained except by the fact\r\nthat, evidently, he felt the need of special schooling in industry--that\r\nunder no circumstances must he allow a thought of indolence to enter his\r\nmind?\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly in the days to come Edison will not only be recognized as an\r\nintellectual prodigy, but as a prodigy of industry--of hard work. In his\r\nfield as inventor and man of science he stands as clear-cut and secure\r\nas the lighthouse on a rock, and as indifferent to the tumult around.\r\nBut as the \"old man\"--and before he was thirty years old he was\r\naffectionately so called by his laboratory associates--he is a normal,\r\nfun-loving, typical American. His sense of humor is intense, but not\r\nof the hothouse, overdeveloped variety. One of his favorite jokes is to\r\nenter the legal department with an air of great humility and apply for a\r\njob as an inventor! Never is he so preoccupied or fretted with cares as\r\nnot to drop all thought of his work for a few moments to listen to a new\r\nstory, with a ready smile all the while, and a hearty, boyish laugh at\r\nthe end. His laugh, in fact, is sometimes almost aboriginal; slapping\r\nhis hands delightedly on his knees, he rocks back and forth and fairly\r\nshouts his pleasure. Recently a daily report of one of his companies\r\nthat had just been started contained a large order amounting to several\r\nthousand dollars, and was returned by him with a miniature sketch of a\r\nsmall individual viewing that particular item through a telescope! His\r\nfacility in making hasty but intensely graphic sketches is proverbial.\r\nHe takes great delight in imitating the lingo of the New York street\r\ngamin. A dignified person named James may be greeted with: \"Hully Gee!\r\nChimmy, when did youse blow in?\" He likes to mimic and imitate types,\r\ngenerally, that are distasteful to him. The sanctimonious hypocrite, the\r\nsleek speculator, and others whom he has probably encountered in life\r\nare done \"to the queen's taste.\"\r\n\r\nOne very cold winter's day he entered the laboratory library in fine\r\nspirits, \"doing\" the decayed dandy, with imaginary cane under his\r\narm, struggling to put on a pair of tattered imaginary gloves, with\r\na self-satisfied smirk and leer that would have done credit to a real\r\ncomedian. This particular bit of acting was heightened by the fact that\r\neven in the coldest weather he wears thin summer clothes, generally\r\nacid-worn and more or less disreputable. For protection he varies the\r\nnumber of his suits of underclothing, sometimes wearing three or four\r\nsets, according to the thermometer.\r\n\r\nIf one could divorce Edison from the idea of work, and could regard\r\nhim separate and apart from his embodiment as an inventor and man of\r\nscience, it might truly be asserted that his temperament is essentially\r\nmercurial. Often he is in the highest spirits, with all the spontaneity\r\nof youth, and again he is depressed, moody, and violently angry. Anger\r\nwith him, however, is a good deal like the story attributed to Napoleon:\r\n\r\n\"Sire, how is it that your judgment is not affected by your great rage?\"\r\nasked one of his courtiers.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said the Emperor, \"I never allow it to rise above this line,\"\r\ndrawing his hand across his throat. Edison has been seen sometimes\r\nalmost beside himself with anger at a stupid mistake or inexcusable\r\noversight on the part of an assistant, his voice raised to a high pitch,\r\nsneeringly expressing his feelings of contempt for the offender; and yet\r\nwhen the culprit, like a bad school-boy, has left the room, Edison has\r\nimmediately returned to his normal poise, and the incident is a thing\r\nof the past. At other times the unsettled condition persists, and his\r\nspleen is vented not only on the original instigator but upon others who\r\nmay have occasion to see him, sometimes hours afterward. When such a\r\nfit is on him the word is quickly passed around, and but few of his\r\nassociates find it necessary to consult with him at the time. The\r\ngenuine anger can generally be distinguished from the imitation article\r\nby those who know him intimately by the fact that when really enraged\r\nhis forehead between the eyes partakes of a curious rotary movement that\r\ncannot be adequately described in words. It is as if the storm-clouds\r\nwithin are moving like a whirling cyclone. As a general rule, Edison\r\ndoes not get genuinely angry at mistakes and other human weaknesses of\r\nhis subordinates; at best he merely simulates anger. But woe betide the\r\none who has committed an act of bad faith, treachery, dishonesty, or\r\ningratitude; THEN Edison can show what it is for a strong man to get\r\ndownright mad. But in this respect he is singularly free, and his\r\nspells of anger are really few. In fact, those who know him best are\r\ncontinually surprised at his moderation and patience, often when there\r\nhas been great provocation. People who come in contact with him and who\r\nmay have occasion to oppose his views, may leave with the impression\r\nthat he is hot-tempered; nothing could be further from the truth. He\r\nargues his point with great vehemence, pounds on the table to emphasize\r\nhis views, and illustrates his theme with a wealth of apt similes; but,\r\non account of his deafness, it is difficult to make the argument really\r\ntwo-sided. Before the visitor can fully explain his side of the matter\r\nsome point is brought up that starts Edison off again, and new arguments\r\nfrom his viewpoint are poured forth. This constant interruption is taken\r\nby many to mean that Edison has a small opinion of any arguments that\r\noppose him; but he is only intensely in earnest in presenting his own\r\nside. If the visitor persists until Edison has seen both sides of the\r\ncontroversy, he is always willing to frankly admit that his own views\r\nmay be unsound and that his opponent is right. In fact, after such a\r\ncontroversy, both parties going after each other hammer and tongs, the\r\narguments TO HIM being carried on at the very top of one's voice to\r\nenable him to hear, and FROM HIM being equally loud in the excitement\r\nof the discussion, he has often said: \"I see now that my position was\r\nabsolutely rotten.\"\r\n\r\nObviously, however, all of these personal characteristics have nothing\r\nto do with Edison's position in the world of affairs. They show him\r\nto be a plain, easy-going, placid American, with no sense of\r\nself-importance, and ready at all times to have his mind turned into a\r\nlighter channel. In private life they show him to be a good citizen, a\r\ngood family man, absolutely moral, temperate in all things, and of great\r\ncharitableness to all mankind. But what of his position in the age\r\nin which he lives? Where does he rank in the mountain range of great\r\nAmericans?\r\n\r\nIt is believed that from the other chapters of this book the reader can\r\nformulate his own answer to the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO THE APPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE reader who has followed the foregoing narrative may feel that\r\ninasmuch as it is intended to be an historical document, an appropriate\r\naddendum thereto would be a digest of all the inventions of Edison. The\r\ndesirability of such a digest is not to be denied, but as there are some\r\ntwenty-five hundred or more inventions to be considered (including those\r\ncovered by caveats), the task of its preparation would be stupendous.\r\nBesides, the resultant data would extend this book into several\r\nadditional volumes, thereby rendering it of value chiefly to the\r\ntechnical student, but taking it beyond the bounds of biography.\r\n\r\nWe should, however, deem our presentation of Mr. Edison's work to\r\nbe imperfectly executed if we neglected to include an intelligible\r\nexposition of the broader theoretical principles of his more important\r\ninventions. In the following Appendix we have therefore endeavored\r\nto present a few brief statements regarding Mr. Edison's principal\r\ninventions, classified as to subject-matter and explained in language\r\nas free from technicalities as is possible. No attempt has been made to\r\nconform with strictly scientific terminology, but, for the benefit of\r\nthe general reader, well-understood conventional expressions, such as\r\n\"flow of current,\" etc., have been employed. It should be borne in mind\r\nthat each of the following items has been treated as a whole or class,\r\ngenerally speaking, and not as a digest of all the individual patents\r\nrelating to it. Any one who is sufficiently interested can obtain copies\r\nof any of the patents referred to for five cents each by addressing the\r\nCommissioner of Patents, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE STOCK PRINTER\r\n\r\nIN these modern days, when the Stock Ticker is in universal use, one\r\nseldom, if ever, hears the name of Edison coupled with the little\r\ninstrument whose chatterings have such tremendous import to the whole\r\nworld. It is of much interest, however, to remember the fact that it\r\nwas by reason of his notable work in connection with this device that he\r\nfirst became known as an inventor. Indeed, it was through the intrinsic\r\nmerits of his improvements in stock tickers that he made his real entree\r\ninto commercial life.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the ticker did not originate with Edison, as we have already\r\nseen in Chapter VII of the preceding narrative, but at the time of his\r\nemployment with the Western Union, in Boston, in 1868, the crudities of\r\nthe earlier forms made an impression on his practical mind, and he got\r\nout an improved instrument of his own, which he introduced in\r\nBoston through the aid of a professional promoter. Edison, then only\r\ntwenty-one, had less business experience than the promoter, through\r\nwhose manipulation he soon lost his financial interest in this early\r\nticker enterprise. The narrative tells of his coming to New York in\r\n1869, and immediately plunging into the business of gold and stock\r\nreporting. It was at this period that his real work on stock printers\r\ncommenced, first individually, and later as a co-worker with F. L. Pope.\r\nThis inventive period extended over a number of years, during which time\r\nhe took out forty-six patents on stock-printing instruments and devices,\r\ntwo of such patents being issued to Edison and Pope as joint inventors.\r\nThese various inventions were mostly in the line of development of the\r\nart as it progressed during those early years, but out of it all came\r\nthe Edison universal printer, which entered into very extensive use,\r\nand which is still used throughout the United States and in some foreign\r\ncountries to a considerable extent at this very day.\r\n\r\nEdison's inventive work on stock printers has left its mark upon the art\r\nas it exists at the present time. In his earlier work he directed his\r\nattention to the employment of a single-circuit system, in which only\r\none wire was required, the two operations of setting the type-wheels\r\nand of printing being controlled by separate electromagnets which were\r\nactuated through polarized relays, as occasion required, one polarity\r\nenergizing the electromagnet controlling the type-wheels, and the\r\nopposite polarity energizing the electromagnet controlling the printing.\r\nLater on, however, he changed over to a two-wire circuit, such as\r\nshown in Fig. 2 of this article in connection with the universal stock\r\nprinter. In the earliest days of the stock printer, Edison realized\r\nthe vital commercial importance of having all instruments recording\r\nprecisely alike at the same moment, and it was he who first devised (in\r\n1869) the \"unison stop,\" by means of which all connected instruments\r\ncould at any moment be brought to zero from the central transmitting\r\nstation, and thus be made to work in correspondence with the central\r\ninstrument and with one another. He also originated the idea of using\r\nonly one inking-pad and shifting it from side to side to ink the\r\ntype-wheels. It was also in Edison's stock printer that the principle of\r\nshifting type-wheels was first employed. Hence it will be seen that,\r\nas in many other arts, he made a lasting impression in this one by the\r\nintrinsic merits of the improvements resulting from his work therein.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to digest the forty-six patents above named, nor to\r\nfollow Edison through the progressive steps which led to the completion\r\nof his universal printer, but shall simply present a sketch of the\r\ninstrument itself, and follow with a very brief and general explanation\r\nof its theory. The Edison universal printer, as it virtually appears\r\nin practice, is illustrated in Fig. 1 below, from which it will be seen\r\nthat the most prominent parts are the two type-wheels, the inking-pad,\r\nand the paper tape feeding from the reel, all appropriately placed in a\r\nsubstantial framework.\r\n\r\nThe electromagnets and other actuating mechanism cannot be seen plainly\r\nin this figure, but are produced diagrammatically in Fig. 2, and\r\nsomewhat enlarged for convenience of explanation.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there are two electromagnets, one of which, TM, is\r\nknown as the \"type-magnet,\" and the other, PM, as the \"press-magnet,\"\r\nthe former having to do with the operation of the type-wheels, and the\r\nlatter with the pressing of the paper tape against them. As will be seen\r\nfrom the diagram, the armature, A, of the type-magnet has an extension\r\narm, on the end of which is an escapement engaging with a toothed wheel\r\nplaced at the extremity of the shaft carrying the type-wheels. This\r\nextension arm is pivoted at B. Hence, as the armature is alternately\r\nattracted when current passes around its electromagnet, and drawn up by\r\nthe spring on cessation of current, it moves up and down, thus actuating\r\nthe escapement and causing a rotation of the toothed wheel in the\r\ndirection of the arrow. This, in turn, brings any desired letters\r\nor figures on the type-wheels to a central point, where they may be\r\nimpressed upon the paper tape. One type-wheel carries letters, and the\r\nother one figures. These two wheels are mounted rigidly on a sleeve\r\ncarried by the wheel-shaft. As it is desired to print from only one\r\ntype-wheel at a time, it becomes necessary to shift them back and forth\r\nfrom time to time, in order to bring the desired characters in line\r\nwith the paper tape. This is accomplished through the movements of a\r\nthree-arm rocking-lever attached to the wheel-sleeve at the end of\r\nthe shaft. This lever is actuated through the agency of two small pins\r\ncarried by an arm projecting from the press-lever, PL. As the latter\r\nmoves up and down the pins play upon the under side of the lower arm of\r\nthe rocking-lever, thus canting it and pushing the type-wheels to\r\nthe right or left, as the case may be. The operation of shifting the\r\ntype-wheels will be given further on.\r\n\r\nThe press-lever is actuated by the press-magnet. From the diagram\r\nit will be seen that the armature of the latter has a long, pivoted\r\nextension arm, or platen, trough-like in shape, in which the paper tape\r\nruns. It has already been noted that the object of the press-lever is\r\nto press this tape against that character of the type-wheel centrally\r\nlocated above it at the moment. It will at once be perceived that this\r\naction takes place when current flows through the electromagnet and its\r\narmature is attracted downward, the platen again dropping away from the\r\ntype-wheel as the armature is released upon cessation of current. The\r\npaper \"feed\" is shown at the end of the press-lever, and consists of\r\na push \"dog,\" or pawl, which operates to urge the paper forward as the\r\npress-lever descends.\r\n\r\nThe worm-gear which appears in the diagram on the shaft, near the\r\ntoothed wheel, forms part of the unison stop above referred to, but this\r\ndevice is not shown in full, in order to avoid unnecessary complications\r\nof the drawing.\r\n\r\nAt the right-hand side of the diagram (Fig. 2) is shown a portion of\r\nthe transmitting apparatus at a central office. Generally speaking,\r\nthis consists of a motor-driven cylinder having metallic pins placed\r\nat intervals, and arranged spirally, around its periphery. These pins\r\ncorrespond in number to the characters on the type-wheels. A keyboard\r\n(not shown) is arranged above the cylinder, having keys lettered and\r\nnumbered corresponding to the letters and figures on the type-wheels.\r\nUpon depressing any one of these keys the motion of the cylinder is\r\narrested when one of its pins is caught and held by the depressed key.\r\nWhen the key is released the cylinder continues in motion. Hence, it is\r\nevident that the revolution of the cylinder may be interrupted as often\r\nas desired by manipulation of the various keys in transmitting the\r\nletters and figures which are to be recorded by the printing instrument.\r\nThe method of transmission will presently appear.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch (Fig. 2) there will be seen, mounted upon the cylinder\r\nshaft, two wheels made up of metallic segments insulated from each\r\nother, and upon the hubs of these wheels are two brushes which connect\r\nwith the main battery. Resting upon the periphery of these two segmental\r\nwheels there are two brushes to which are connected the wires which\r\ncarry the battery current to the type-magnet and press-magnet,\r\nrespectively, as the brushes make circuit by coming in contact with the\r\nmetallic segments. It will be remembered that upon the cylinder there\r\nare as many pins as there are characters on the type-wheels of the\r\nticker, and one of the segmental wheels, W, has a like number of\r\nmetallic segments, while upon the other wheel, W', there are only\r\none-half that number. The wheel W controls the supply of current to\r\nthe press-magnet, and the wheel W' to the type-magnet. The type-magnet\r\nadvances the letter and figure wheels one step when the magnet is\r\nenergized, and a succeeding step when the circuit is broken. Hence, the\r\nmetallic contact surfaces on wheel W' are, as stated, only half as many\r\nas on the wheel W, which controls the press-magnet.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind, however, that the contact surfaces and\r\ninsulated surfaces on wheel W' are together equal in number to the\r\ncharacters on the type-wheels, but the retractile spring of TM does half\r\nthe work of operating the escapement. On the other hand, the wheel W\r\nhas the full number of contact surfaces, because it must provide for the\r\noperative closure of the press-magnet circuit whether the brush B' is in\r\nengagement with a metallic segment or an insulated segment of the wheel\r\nW'. As the cylinder revolves, the wheels are carried around with its\r\nshaft and current impulses flow through the wires to the magnets as the\r\nbrushes make contact with the metallic segments of these wheels.\r\n\r\nOne example will be sufficient to convey to the reader an idea of the\r\noperation of the apparatus. Assuming, for instance, that it is desired\r\nto send out the letters AM to the printer, let us suppose that the pin\r\ncorresponding to the letter A is at one end of the cylinder and near the\r\nupper part of its periphery, and that the letter M is about the centre\r\nof the cylinder and near the lower part of its periphery. The operator\r\nat the keyboard would depress the letter A, whereupon the cylinder would\r\nin its revolution bring the first-named pin against the key. During\r\nthe rotation of the cylinder a current would pass through wheel W' and\r\nactuate TM, drawing down the armature and operating the escapement,\r\nwhich would bring the type-wheel to a point where the letter A would\r\nbe central as regards the paper tape When the cylinder came to rest,\r\ncurrent would flow through the brush of wheel W to PM, and its armature\r\nwould be attracted, causing the platen to be lifted and thus bringing\r\nthe paper tape in contact with the type-wheel and printing the letter A.\r\nThe operator next sends the letter M by depressing the appropriate key.\r\nOn account of the position of the corresponding pin, the cylinder would\r\nmake nearly half a revolution before bringing the pin to the key. During\r\nthis half revolution the segmental wheels have also been turning, and\r\nthe brushes have transmitted a number of current impulses to TM, which\r\nhave caused it to operate the escapement a corresponding number of\r\ntimes, thus turning the type-wheels around to the letter M. When the\r\ncylinder stops, current once more goes to the press-magnet, and the\r\noperation of lifting and printing is repeated. As a matter of fact,\r\ncurrent flows over both circuits as the cylinder is rotated, but the\r\npress-magnet is purposely made to be comparatively \"sluggish\" and the\r\nnarrowness of the segments on wheel W tends to diminish the flow of\r\ncurrent in the press circuit until the cylinder comes to rest, when the\r\ncurrent continuously flows over that circuit without interruption and\r\nfully energizes the press-magnet. The shifting of the type-wheels is\r\nbrought about as follows: On the keyboard of the transmitter there are\r\ntwo characters known as \"dots\"--namely, the letter dot and the figure\r\ndot. If the operator presses one of these dot keys, it is engaged by an\r\nappropriate pin on the revolving cylinder. Meanwhile the type-wheels are\r\nrotating, carrying with them the rocking-lever, and current is pulsating\r\nover both circuits. When the type-wheels have arrived at the proper\r\npoint the rocking-lever has been carried to a position where its lower\r\narm is directly over one of the pins on the arm extending from the\r\nplaten of the press-lever. The cylinder stops, and current operates\r\nthe sluggish press-magnet, causing its armature to be attracted, thus\r\nlifting the platen and its projecting arm. As the arm lifts upward, the\r\npin moves along the under side of the lower arm of the rocking-lever,\r\nthus causing it to cant and shift the type-wheels to the right or left,\r\nas desired. The principles of operation of this apparatus have been\r\nconfined to a very brief and general description, but it is believed to\r\nbe sufficient for the scope of this article.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The illustrations in this article are reproduced from American\r\nTelegraphy and Encyclopedia of the Telegraph, by William Maver, Jr., by\r\npermission of Maver Publishing Company, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE QUADRUPLEX AND PHONOPLEX\r\n\r\nEDISON'S work in stock printers and telegraphy had marked him as a\r\nrising man in the electrical art of the period but his invention of\r\nquadruplex telegraphy in 1874 was what brought him very prominently\r\nbefore the notice of the public. Duplex telegraphy, or the sending of\r\ntwo separate messages in opposite directions at the same time over\r\none line was known and practiced previous to this time, but quadruplex\r\ntelegraphy, or the simultaneous sending of four separate messages,\r\ntwo in each direction, over a single line had not been successfully\r\naccomplished, although it had been the subject of many an inventor's\r\ndream and the object of anxious efforts for many long years.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1873, and for some time afterward, the system\r\ninvented by Joseph Stearns was the duplex in practical use. In April of\r\nthat year, however, Edison took up the study of the subject and filed\r\ntwo applications for patents. One of these applications [23] embraced\r\nan invention by which two messages could be sent not only duplex, or\r\nin opposite directions as above explained, but could also be sent\r\n\"diplex\"--that is to say, in one direction, simultaneously, as separate\r\nand distinct messages, over the one line. Thus there was introduced a\r\nnew feature into the art of multiplex telegraphy, for, whereas duplexing\r\n(accomplished by varying the strength of the current) permitted messages\r\nto be sent simultaneously from opposite stations, diplexing (achieved\r\nby also varying the direction of the current) permitted the simultaneous\r\ntransmission of two messages from the same station and their separate\r\nreception at the distant station.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 23: Afterward issued as Patent No. 162,633, April\r\n     27, 1875.]\r\n\r\nThe quadruplex was the tempting goal toward which Edison now constantly\r\nturned, and after more than a year's strenuous work he filed a number of\r\napplications for patents in the late summer of 1874. Among them was one\r\nwhich was issued some years afterward as Patent No. 480,567, covering\r\nhis well-known quadruplex. He had improved his own diplex, combined it\r\nwith the Stearns duplex and thereby produced a system by means of which\r\nfour messages could be sent over a single line at the same time, two in\r\neach direction.\r\n\r\nAs the reader will probably be interested to learn something of the\r\ntheoretical principles of this fascinating invention, we shall endeavor\r\nto offer a brief and condensed explanation thereof with as little\r\ntechnicality as the subject will permit. This explanation will\r\nnecessarily be of somewhat elementary character for the benefit of the\r\nlay reader, whose indulgence is asked for an occasional reiteration\r\nintroduced for the sake of clearness of comprehension. While the\r\napparatus and the circuits are seemingly very intricate, the principles\r\nare really quite simple, and the difficulty of comprehension is more\r\napparent than real if the underlying phenomena are studied attentively.\r\n\r\nAt the root of all systems of telegraphy, including multiplex systems,\r\nthere lies the single basic principle upon which their performance\r\ndepends--namely, the obtaining of a slight mechanical movement at the\r\nmore or less distant end of a telegraph line. This is accomplished\r\nthrough the utilization of the phenomena of electromagnetism. These\r\nphenomena are easy of comprehension and demonstration. If a rod of soft\r\niron be wound around with a number of turns of insulated wire, and\r\na current of electricity be sent through the wire, the rod will be\r\ninstantly magnetized and will remain a magnet as long as the current\r\nflows; but when the current is cut off the magnetic effect instantly\r\nceases. This device is known as an electromagnet, and the charging and\r\ndischarging of such a magnet may, of course, be repeated indefinitely.\r\nInasmuch as a magnet has the power of attracting to itself pieces of\r\niron or steel, the basic importance of an electromagnet in telegraphy\r\nwill be at once apparent when we consider the sounder, whose clicks\r\nare familiar to every ear. This instrument consists essentially of an\r\nelectro-magnet of horseshoe form with its two poles close together, and\r\nwith its armature, a bar of iron, maintained in close proximity to the\r\npoles, but kept normally in a retracted position by a spring. When\r\nthe distant operator presses down his key the circuit is closed and a\r\ncurrent passes along the line and through the (generally two) coils of\r\nthe electromagnet, thus magnetizing the iron core. Its attractive power\r\ndraws the armature toward the poles. When the operator releases the\r\npressure on his key the circuit is broken, current does not flow, the\r\nmagnetic effect ceases, and the armature is drawn back by its spring.\r\nThese movements give rise to the clicking sounds which represent the\r\ndots and dashes of the Morse or other alphabet as transmitted by the\r\noperator. Similar movements, produced in like manner, are availed of\r\nin another instrument known as the relay, whose office is to act\r\npractically as an automatic transmitter key, repeating the messages\r\nreceived in its coils, and sending them on to the next section of the\r\nline, equipped with its own battery; or, when the message is intended\r\nfor its own station, sending the message to an adjacent sounder included\r\nin a local battery circuit. With a simple circuit, therefore, between\r\ntwo stations and where an intermediate battery is not necessary, a relay\r\nis not used.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the consideration of another phase of the phenomena of\r\nelectromagnetism, the reader's attention is called to Fig. 1, in which\r\nwill be seen on the left a simple form of electromagnet consisting of\r\na bar of soft iron wound around with insulated wire, through which a\r\ncurrent is flowing from a battery. The arrows indicate the direction of\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nAll magnets have two poles, north and south. A permanent magnet (made of\r\nsteel, which, as distinguished from soft iron, retains its magnetism for\r\nlong periods) is so called because it is permanently magnetized and its\r\npolarity remains fixed. In an electromagnet the magnetism exists only\r\nas long as current is flowing through the wire, and the polarity of the\r\nsoft-iron bar is determined by the DIRECTION of flow of current around\r\nit for the time being. If the direction is reversed, the polarity will\r\nalso be reversed. Assuming, for instance, the bar to be end-on toward\r\nthe observer, that end will be a south pole if the current is flowing\r\nfrom left to right, clockwise, around the bar; or a north pole if\r\nflowing in the other direction, as illustrated at the right of the\r\nfigure. It is immaterial which way the wire is wound around the bar, the\r\ndetermining factor of polarity being the DIRECTION of the current. It\r\nwill be clear, therefore, that if two EQUAL currents be passed around\r\na bar in opposite directions (Fig. 3) they will tend to produce exactly\r\nopposite polarities and thus neutralize each other. Hence, the bar would\r\nremain non-magnetic.\r\n\r\nAs the path to the quadruplex passes through the duplex, let us consider\r\nthe Stearns system, after noting one other principle--namely, that\r\nif more than one path is presented in which an electric current may\r\ncomplete its circuit, it divides in proportion to the resistance of each\r\npath. Hence, if we connect one pole of a battery with the earth, and\r\nfrom the other pole run to the earth two wires of equal resistance as\r\nillustrated in Fig. 2, equal currents will traverse the wires.\r\n\r\nThe above principles were employed in the Stearns differential duplex\r\nsystem in the following manner: Referring to Fig. 3, suppose a wire, A,\r\nis led from a battery around a bar of soft iron from left to right, and\r\nanother wire of equal resistance and equal number of turns, B, around\r\nfrom right to left. The flow of current will cause two equal opposing\r\nactions to be set up in the bar; one will exactly offset the other, and\r\nno magnetic effect will be produced. A relay thus wound is known as a\r\ndifferential relay--more generally called a neutral relay.\r\n\r\nThe non-technical reader may wonder what use can possibly be made of an\r\napparently non-operative piece of apparatus. It must be borne in mind,\r\nhowever, in considering a duplex system, that a differential relay is\r\nused AT EACH END of the line and forms part of the circuit; and that\r\nwhile each relay must be absolutely unresponsive to the signals SENT\r\nOUT FROM ITS HOME OFFICE, it must respond to signals transmitted by\r\na DISTANT OFFICE. Hence, the next figure (4), with its accompanying\r\nexplanation, will probably make the matter clear. If another battery,\r\nD, be introduced at the distant end of the wire A the differential or\r\nneutral relay becomes actively operative as follows: Battery C supplies\r\nwires A and B with an equal current, but battery D doubles the strength\r\nof the current traversing wire A. This is sufficient to not only\r\nneutralize the magnetism which the current in wire B would tend to set\r\nup, but also--by reason of the excess of current in wire A--to make the\r\nbar a magnet whose polarity would be determined by the direction of the\r\nflow of current around it.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement shown in Fig. 4 the batteries are so connected that\r\ncurrent flow is in the same direction, thus doubling the amount of\r\ncurrent flowing through wire A. But suppose the batteries were\r\nso connected that the current from each set flowed in an opposite\r\ndirection? The result would be that these currents would oppose and\r\nneutralize each other, and, therefore, none would flow in wire A.\r\nInasmuch, however, as there is nothing to hinder, current would\r\nflow from battery C through wire B, and the bar would therefore be\r\nmagnetized. Hence, assuming that the relay is to be actuated from\r\nthe distant end, D, it is in a sense immaterial whether the batteries\r\nconnected with wire A assist or oppose each other, as, in either case,\r\nthe bar would be magnetized only through the operation of the distant\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nA slight elaboration of Fig. 4 will further illustrate the principle of\r\nthe differential duplex. In Fig. 5 are two stations, A the home end,\r\nand B the distant station to which a message is to be sent. The relay at\r\neach end has two coils, 1 and 2, No. 1 in each case being known as the\r\n\"main-line coil\" and 2 as the \"artificial-line coil.\" The latter, in\r\neach case, has in its circuit a resistance, R, to compensate for the\r\nresistance of the main line, so that there shall be no inequalities\r\nin the circuits. The artificial line, as well as that to which the two\r\ncoils are joined, are connected to earth. There is a battery, C, and a\r\nkey, K. When the key is depressed, current flows through the relay\r\ncoils at A, but no magnetism is produced, as they oppose each other. The\r\ncurrent, however, flows out through the main-line coil over the line and\r\nthrough the main-line coil 1 at B, completing its circuit to earth\r\nand magnetizing the bar of the relay, thus causing its armature to be\r\nattracted. On releasing the key the circuit is broken and magnetism\r\ninstantly ceases.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident, therefore, that the operator at A may cause the\r\nrelay at B to act without affecting his own relay. Similar effects would\r\nbe produced from B to A if the battery and key were placed at the B end.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, like instruments are placed at each end of the line, as\r\nin Fig. 6, we have a differential duplex arrangement by means of which\r\ntwo operators may actuate relays at the ends distant from them, without\r\ncausing the operation of the relays at their home ends. In practice\r\nthis is done by means of a special instrument known as a continuity\r\npreserving transmitter, or, usually, as a transmitter. This consists\r\nof an electromagnet, T, operated by a key, K, and separate battery. The\r\narmature lever, L, is long, pivoted in the centre, and is bent over\r\nat the end. At a point a little beyond its centre is a small piece of\r\ninsulating material to which is screwed a strip of spring metal, S.\r\nConveniently placed with reference to the end of the lever is a bent\r\nmetallic piece, P, having a contact screw in its upper horizontal arm,\r\nand attached to the lower end of this bent piece is a post, or standard,\r\nto which the main battery is electrically connected. The relay coils\r\nare connected by wire to the spring piece, S, and the armature lever is\r\nconnected to earth. If the key is depressed, the armature is attracted\r\nand its bent end is moved upward, depressing the spring which makes\r\ncontact with the upper screw, which places the battery to the line, and\r\nsimultaneously breaks the ground connection between the spring and\r\nthe upturned end of the lever, as shown at the left. When the key is\r\nreleased the battery is again connected to earth. The compensating\r\nresistances and condensers necessary for a duplex arrangement are shown\r\nin the diagram.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 6 one transmitter is shown as closed, at A, while the other one\r\nis open. From our previous illustrations and explanations it will be\r\nreadily seen that, with the transmitter closed at station A, current\r\nflows via post P, through S, and to both relay coils at A, thence over\r\nthe main line to main-line coil at B, and down to earth through S and\r\nthe armature lever with its grounded wire. The relay at A would be\r\nunresponsive, but the core of the relay at B would be magnetized and its\r\narmature respond to signals from A. In like manner, if the transmitter\r\nat B be closed, current would flow through similar parts and thus\r\ncause the relay at A to respond. If both transmitters be closed\r\nsimultaneously, both batteries will be placed to the line, which would\r\npractically result in doubling the current in each of the main-line\r\ncoils, in consequence of which both relays are energized and their\r\narmatures attracted through the operation of the keys at the distant\r\nends. Hence, two messages can be sent in opposite directions over the\r\nsame line simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe reader will undoubtedly see quite clearly from the above system,\r\nwhich rests upon varying the STRENGTH of the current, that two messages\r\ncould not be sent in the same direction over the one line at the same\r\ntime. To accomplish this object Edison introduced another and distinct\r\nfeature--namely, the using of the same current, but ALSO varying its\r\nDIRECTION of flow; that is to say, alternately reversing the POLARITY\r\nof the batteries as applied to the line and thus producing corresponding\r\nchanges in the polarity of another specially constructed type of relay,\r\ncalled a polarized relay. To afford the reader a clear conception of\r\nsuch a relay we would refer again to Fig. 1 and its explanation, from\r\nwhich it appears that the polarity of a soft-iron bar is determined not\r\nby the strength of the current flowing around it but by the direction\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nWith this idea clearly in mind, the theory of the polarized relay,\r\ngenerally called \"polar\" relay, as presented in the diagram (Fig. 7),\r\nwill be readily understood.\r\n\r\nA is a bar of soft iron, bent as shown, and wound around with insulated\r\ncopper wire, the ends of which are connected with a battery, B, thus\r\nforming an electromagnet. An essential part of this relay consists of\r\na swinging PERMANENT magnet, C, whose polarity remains fixed, that end\r\nbetween the terminals of the electromagnet being a north pole. Inasmuch\r\nas unlike poles of magnets are attracted to each other and like poles\r\nrepelled, it follows that this north pole will be repelled by the north\r\npole of the electromagnet, but will swing over and be attracted by\r\nits south pole. If the direction of flow of current be reversed, by\r\nreversing the battery, the electromagnetic polarity also reverses and\r\nthe end of the permanent magnet swings over to the other side. This\r\nis shown in the two figures of Fig. 7. This device being a relay, its\r\npurpose is to repeat transmitted signals into a local circuit, as before\r\nexplained. For this purpose there are provided at D and E a contact and\r\na back stop, the former of which is opened and closed by the swinging\r\npermanent magnet, thus opening and closing the local circuit.\r\n\r\nManifestly there must be provided some convenient way for rapidly\r\ntransposing the direction of the current flow if such a device as the\r\npolar relay is to be used for the reception of telegraph messages, and\r\nthis is accomplished by means of an instrument called a pole-changer,\r\nwhich consists essentially of a movable contact piece connected\r\npermanently to the earth, or grounded, and arranged to connect one or\r\nthe other pole of a battery to the line and simultaneously ground the\r\nother pole. This action of the pole-changer is effected by movements of\r\nthe armature of an electromagnet through the manipulation of an ordinary\r\ntelegraph key by an operator at the home station, as in the operation of\r\nthe \"transmitter,\" above referred to.\r\n\r\nBy a combination of the neutral relay and the polar relay two\r\noperators, by manipulating two telegraph keys in the ordinary way, can\r\nsimultaneously send two messages over one line in the SAME direction\r\nwith the SAME current, one operator varying its strength and the other\r\noperator varying its polarity or direction of flow. This principle was\r\ncovered by Edison's Patent No. 162,633, and was known as the \"diplex\"\r\nsystem, although, in the patent referred to, Edison showed and claimed\r\nthe adaptation of the principle to duplex telegraphy. Indeed, as\r\na matter of fact, it was found that by winding the polar relay\r\ndifferentially and arranging the circuits and collateral appliances\r\nappropriately, the polar duplex system was more highly efficient than\r\nthe neutral system, and it is extensively used to the present day.\r\n\r\nThus far we have referred to two systems, one the neutral or\r\ndifferential duplex, and the other the combination of the neutral and\r\npolar relays, making a diplex system. By one of these two systems\r\na single wire could be used for sending two messages in opposite\r\ndirections, and by the other in the same direction or in opposite\r\ndirections. Edison followed up his work on the diplex and combined the\r\ntwo systems into the quadruplex, by means of which FOUR messages could\r\nbe sent and received simultaneously over the one wire, two in each\r\ndirection, thus employing eight operators--four at each end--two sending\r\nand two receiving. The general principles of quadruplex telegraphy are\r\nbased upon the phenomena which we have briefly outlined in connection\r\nwith the neutral relay and the polar relay. The equipment of such\r\na system at each end of the line consists of these two instruments,\r\ntogether with the special form of transmitter and the pole-changer and\r\ntheir keys for actuating the neutral and polar relays at the other, or\r\ndistant, end. Besides these there are the compensating resistances and\r\ncondensers. All of these will be seen in the diagram (Fig. 8). It\r\nwill be understood, of course, that the polar relay, as used in the\r\nquadruplex system, is wound differentially, and therefore its operation\r\nis somewhat similar in principle to that of the differentially wound\r\nneutral relay, in that it does not respond to the operation of the key\r\nat the home office, but only operates in response to the movements of\r\nthe distant key.\r\n\r\nOur explanation has merely aimed to show the underlying phenomena and\r\nprinciples in broad outline without entering into more detail than was\r\ndeemed absolutely necessary. It should be stated, however, that between\r\nthe outline and the filling in of the details there was an enormous\r\namount of hard work, study, patient plodding, and endless experiments\r\nbefore Edison finally perfected his quadruplex system in the year 1874.\r\n\r\nIf it were attempted to offer here a detailed explanation of the varied\r\nand numerous operations of the quadruplex, this article would assume the\r\nproportions of a treatise. An idea of their complexity may be gathered\r\nfrom the following, which is quoted from American Telegraphy and\r\nEncyclopedia of the Telegraph, by William Maver, Jr.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It may well be doubted whether in the whole range of applied\r\nelectricity there occur such beautiful combinations, so quickly made,\r\nbroken up, and others reformed, as in the operation of the Edison\r\nquadruplex. For example, it is quite demonstrable that during the making\r\nof a simple dash of the Morse alphabet by the neutral relay at the home\r\nstation the distant pole-changer may reverse its battery several times;\r\nthe home pole-changer may do likewise, and the home transmitter may\r\nincrease and decrease the electromotive force of the home battery\r\nrepeatedly. Simultaneously, and, of course, as a consequence of the\r\nforegoing actions, the home neutral relay itself may have had its\r\nmagnetism reversed several times, and the SIGNAL, that is, the dash,\r\nwill have been made, partly by the home battery, partly by the distant\r\nand home batteries combined, partly by current on the main line, partly\r\nby current on the artificial line, partly by the main-line 'static'\r\ncurrent, partly by the condenser static current, and yet, on a\r\nwell-adjusted circuit the dash will have been produced on the quadruplex\r\nsounder as clearly as any dash on an ordinary single-wire sounder.\"\r\n\r\nWe present a diagrammatic illustration of the Edison quadruplex, battery\r\nkey system, in Fig. 8, and refer the reader to the above or other\r\ntext-books if he desires to make a close study of its intricate\r\noperations. Before finally dismissing the quadruplex, and for the\r\nbenefit of the inquiring reader who may vainly puzzle over the\r\nintricacies of the circuits shown in Fig. 8, a hint as to an essential\r\ndifference between the neutral relay, as used in the duplex and as used\r\nin the quadruplex, may be given. With the duplex, as we have seen, the\r\ncurrent on the main line is changed in strength only when both keys at\r\nOPPOSITE stations are closed together, so that a current due to both\r\nbatteries flows over the main line. When a single message is sent from\r\none station to the other, or when both stations are sending messages\r\nthat do not conflict, only one battery or the other is connected to the\r\nmain line; but with the quadruplex, suppose one of the operators, in New\r\nYork for instance, is sending reversals of current to Chicago; we can\r\nreadily see how these changes in polarity will operate the polar relay\r\nat the distant station, but why will they not also operate the neutral\r\nrelay at the distant station as well? This difficulty was solved by\r\ndividing the battery at each station into two unequal parts, the smaller\r\nbattery being always in circuit with the pole-changer ready to have its\r\npolarity reversed on the main line to operate the distant polar relay,\r\nbut the spring retracting the armature of the neutral relay is made so\r\nstiff as to resist these weak currents. If, however, the transmitter is\r\noperated at the same end, the entire battery is connected to the main\r\nline, and the strength of this current is sufficient to operate the\r\nneutral relay. Whether the part or all the battery is alternately\r\nconnected to or disconnected from the main line by the transmitter, the\r\ncurrent so varied in strength is subject to reversal of polarity by the\r\npole-changer; but the variations in strength have no effect upon the\r\ndistant polar relay, because that relay being responsive to changes\r\nin polarity of a weak current is obviously responsive to corresponding\r\nchanges in polarity of a powerful current. With this distinction before\r\nhim, the reader will have no difficulty in following the circuits\r\nof Fig. 8, bearing always in mind that by reason of the differential\r\nwinding of the polar and neutral relays, neither of the relays at one\r\nstation will respond to the home battery, and can only respond to the\r\ndistant battery--the polar relay responding when the polarity of the\r\ncurrent is reversed, whether the current be strong or weak, and the\r\nneutral relay responding when the line-current is increased, regardless\r\nof its polarity. It should be added that besides the system illustrated\r\nin Fig. 8, which is known as the differential principle, the quadruplex\r\nwas also arranged to operate on the Wheatstone bridge principle; but\r\nit is not deemed necessary to enter into its details. The underlying\r\nphenomena were similar, the difference consisting largely in the\r\narrangement of the circuits and apparatus. [24]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 24: Many of the illustrations in this article are\r\n     reproduced from American Telegraphy and Encyclopedia of the\r\n     Telegraph, by William Maver, Jr., by permission of Maver\r\n     Publishing Company, New York.]\r\n\r\nEdison made another notable contribution to multiplex telegraphy\r\nsome years later in the Phonoplex. The name suggests the use of the\r\ntelephone, and such indeed is the case. The necessity for this invention\r\narose out of the problem of increasing the capacity of telegraph lines\r\nemployed in \"through\" and \"way\" service, such as upon railroads. In a\r\nrailroad system there are usually two terminal stations and a number of\r\nway stations. There is naturally much intercommunication, which would\r\nbe greatly curtailed by a system having the capacity of only a single\r\nmessage at a time. The duplexes above described could not be used on\r\na railroad telegraph system, because of the necessity of electrically\r\nbalancing the line, which, while entirely feasible on a through line,\r\nwould not be practicable between a number of intercommunicating points.\r\nEdison's phonoplex normally doubled the capacity of telegraph lines,\r\nwhether employed on way business or through traffic, but in actual\r\npractice made it possible to obtain more than double service. It has\r\nbeen in practical use for many years on some of the leading railroads of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe system is a combination of telegraphic apparatus and telephone\r\nreceiver, although in this case the latter instrument is not used in the\r\ngenerally understood manner. It is well known that the diaphragm of a\r\ntelephone vibrates with the fluctuations of the current energizing the\r\nmagnet beneath it. If the make and break of the magnetizing current\r\nbe rapid, the vibrations being within the limits of the human ear, the\r\ndiaphragm will produce an audible sound; but if the make and break be as\r\nslow as with ordinary Morse transmission, the diaphragm will be merely\r\nflexed and return to its original form without producing a sound. If,\r\ntherefore, there be placed in the same circuit a regular telegraph relay\r\nand a special telephone, an operator may, by manipulating a key, operate\r\nthe relay (and its sounder) without producing a sound in the telephone,\r\nas the makes and breaks of the key are far below the limit of\r\naudibility. But if through the same circuit, by means of another key\r\nsuitably connected there is sent the rapid changes in current from an\r\ninduction-coil, it will cause a series of loud clicks in the telephone,\r\ncorresponding to the signals transmitted; but this current is too weak\r\nto affect the telegraph relay. It will be seen, therefore, that this\r\nmethod of duplexing is practiced, not by varying the strength or\r\npolarity, but by sending TWO KINDS OF CURRENT over the wire. Thus, two\r\nsets of Morse signals can be transmitted by two operators over one\r\nline at the same time without interfering with each other, and not only\r\nbetween terminal offices, but also between a terminal office and any\r\nintermediate office, or between two intermediate offices alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC TELEGRAPHY\r\n\r\nFROM the year 1848, when a Scotchman, Alexander Bain, first devised a\r\nscheme for rapid telegraphy by automatic methods, down to the beginning\r\nof the seventies, many other inventors had also applied themselves to\r\nthe solution of this difficult problem, with only indifferent success.\r\n\"Cheap telegraphy\" being the slogan of the time, Edison became arduously\r\ninterested in the subject, and at the end of three years of hard work\r\nproduced an entirely successful system, a public test of which was made\r\non December 11, 1873 when about twelve thousand (12,000) words\r\nwere transmitted over a single wire from Washington to New York. in\r\ntwenty-two and one-half minutes. Edison's system was commercially\r\nexploited for several years by the Automatic Telegraph Company, as\r\nrelated in the preceding narrative.\r\n\r\nAs a premise to an explanation of the principles involved it should be\r\nnoted that the transmission of telegraph messages by hand at a rate of\r\nfifty words per minute is considered a good average speed; hence, the\r\navailability of a telegraph line, as thus operated, is limited to this\r\ncapacity except as it may be multiplied by two with the use of\r\nthe duplex, or by four, with the quadruplex. Increased rapidity of\r\ntransmission may, however, be accomplished by automatic methods, by\r\nmeans of which, through the employment of suitable devices, messages may\r\nbe stamped in or upon a paper tape, transmitted through automatically\r\nacting instruments, and be received at distant points in visible\r\ncharacters, upon a similar tape, at a rate twenty or more times\r\ngreater--a speed far beyond the possibilities of the human hand to\r\ntransmit or the ear to receive.\r\n\r\nIn Edison's system of automatic telegraphy a paper tape was perforated\r\nwith a series of round holes, so arranged and spaced as to represent\r\nMorse characters, forming the words of the message to be transmitted.\r\nThis was done in a special machine of Edison's invention, called a\r\nperforator, consisting of a series of punches operated by a bank of\r\nkeys--typewriter fashion. The paper tape passed over a cylinder, and\r\nwas kept in regular motion so as to receive the perforations in proper\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\nThe perforated tape was then placed in the transmitting instrument,\r\nthe essential parts of which were a metallic drum and a projecting arm\r\ncarrying two small wheels, which, by means of a spring, were maintained\r\nin constant pressure on the drum. The wheels and drum were electrically\r\nconnected in the line over which the message was to be sent. current\r\nbeing supplied by batteries in the ordinary manner.\r\n\r\nWhen the transmitting instrument was in operation, the perforated tape\r\nwas passed over the drum in continuous, progressive motion. Thus, the\r\npaper passed between the drum and the two small wheels, and, as dry\r\npaper is a non-conductor, current was prevented from passing until a\r\nperforation was reached. As the paper passed along, the wheels dropped\r\ninto the perforations, making momentary contacts with the drum beneath\r\nand causing momentary impulses of current to be transmitted over the\r\nline in the same way that they would be produced by the manipulation\r\nof the telegraph key, but with much greater rapidity. The perforations\r\nbeing so arranged as to regulate the length of the contact, the result\r\nwould be the transmission of long and short impulses corresponding with\r\nthe dots and dashes of the Morse alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe receiving instrument at the other end of the line was constructed\r\nupon much the same general lines as the transmitter, consisting of a\r\nmetallic drum and reels for the paper tape. Instead of the two small\r\ncontact wheels, however, a projecting arm carried an iron pin or stylus,\r\nso arranged that its point would normally impinge upon the periphery of\r\nthe drum. The iron pin and the drum were respectively connected so as to\r\nbe in circuit with the transmission line and batteries. As the principle\r\ninvolved in the receiving operation was electrochemical decomposition,\r\nthe paper tape upon which the incoming message was to be received was\r\nmoistened with a chemical solution readily decomposable by the electric\r\ncurrent. This paper, while still in a damp condition, was passed\r\nbetween the drum and stylus in continuous, progressive motion. When an\r\nelectrical impulse came over the line from the transmitting end, current\r\npassed through the moistened paper from the iron pin, causing chemical\r\ndecomposition, by reason of which the iron would be attacked and would\r\nmark a line on the paper. Such a line would be long or short, according\r\nto the duration of the electric impulse. Inasmuch as a succession of\r\nsuch impulses coming over the line owed their origin to the perforations\r\nin the transmitting tape, it followed that the resulting marks upon the\r\nreceiving tape would correspond thereto in their respective lengths.\r\nHence, the transmitted message was received on the tape in visible dots\r\nand dashes representing characters of the Morse alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe system will, perhaps, be better understood by reference to the\r\nfollowing diagrammatic sketch of its general principles:\r\n\r\nSome idea of the rapidity of automatic telegraphy may be obtained when\r\nwe consider the fact that with the use of Edison's system in the early\r\nseventies it was common practice to transmit and receive from three to\r\nfour thousand words a minute over a single line between New York and\r\nPhiladelphia. This system was exploited through the use of a moderately\r\npaid clerical force.\r\n\r\nIn practice, there was employed such a number of perforating machines\r\nas the exigencies of business demanded. Each machine was operated by\r\na clerk, who translated the message into telegraphic characters and\r\nprepared the transmitting tape by punching the necessary perforations\r\ntherein. An expert clerk could perforate such a tape at the rate of\r\nfifty to sixty words per minute. At the receiving end the tape was taken\r\nby other clerks who translated the Morse characters into ordinary words,\r\nwhich were written on message blanks for delivery to persons for whom\r\nthe messages were intended.\r\n\r\nThis latter operation--\"copying.\" as it was called--was not consistent\r\nwith truly economical business practice. Edison therefore undertook the\r\ntask of devising an improved system whereby the message when received\r\nwould not require translation and rewriting, but would automatically\r\nappear on the tape in plain letters and words, ready for instant\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nThe result was his automatic Roman letter system, the basis for which\r\nincluded the above-named general principles of perforated transmission\r\ntape and electrochemical decomposition. Instead of punching Morse\r\ncharacters in the transmission tape however, it was perforated with\r\na series of small round holes forming Roman letters. The verticals\r\nof these letters were originally five holes high. The transmitting\r\ninstrument had five small wheels or rollers, instead of two, for making\r\ncontacts through the perforations and causing short electric impulses\r\nto pass over the lines. At first five lines were used to carry these\r\nimpulses to the receiving instrument, where there were five iron pins\r\nimpinging on the drum. By means of these pins the chemically prepared\r\ntape was marked with dots corresponding to the impulses as received,\r\nleaving upon it a legible record of the letters and words transmitted.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of economy in investment and maintenance, Edison devised\r\nsubsequently a plan by which the number of conducting lines was reduced\r\nto two, instead of five. The verticals of the letters were perforated\r\nonly four holes high, and the four rollers were arranged in pairs, one\r\npair being slightly in advance of the other. There were, of course,\r\nonly four pins at the receiving instrument. Two were of iron and two of\r\ntellurium, it being the gist of Edison's plan to effect the marking\r\nof the chemical paper by one metal with a positive current, and by the\r\nother metal with a negative current. In the following diagram, which\r\nshows the theory of this arrangement, it will be seen that both the\r\ntransmitting rollers and the receiving pins are arranged in pairs,\r\none pair in each case being slightly in advance of the other. Of these\r\nreceiving pins, one pair--1 and 3--are of iron, and the other pair--2\r\nand 4--of tellurium. Pins 1-2 and 3-4 are electrically connected\r\ntogether in other pairs, and then each of these pairs is connected with\r\none of the main lines that run respectively to the middle of two groups\r\nof batteries at the transmitting end. The terminals of these groups of\r\nbatteries are connected respectively to the four rollers which impinge\r\nupon the transmitting drum, the negatives being connected to 5 and 7,\r\nand the positives to 6 and 8, as denoted by the letters N and P. The\r\ntransmitting and receiving drums are respectively connected to earth.\r\n\r\nIn operation the perforated tape is placed on the transmission drum, and\r\nthe chemically prepared tape on the receiving drum. As the perforated\r\ntape passes over the transmission drum the advanced rollers 6 or 8\r\nfirst close the circuit through the perforations, and a positive current\r\npasses from the batteries through the drum and down to the ground;\r\nthence through the earth at the receiving end up to the other drum and\r\nback to the batteries via the tellurium pins 2 or 4 and the line wire.\r\nWith this positive current the tellurium pins make marks upon the\r\npaper tape, but the iron pins make no mark. In the merest fraction of a\r\nsecond, as the perforated paper continues to pass over the transmission\r\ndrum, the rollers 5 or 7 close the circuit through other perforations\r\nand t e current passes in the opposite direction, over the line wire,\r\nthrough pins 1 or 3, and returns through the earth. In this case the\r\niron pins mark the paper tape, but the tellurium pins make no mark. It\r\nwill be obvious, therefore, that as the rollers are set so as to allow\r\nof currents of opposite polarity to be alternately and rapidly sent\r\nby means of the perforations, the marks upon the tape at the receiving\r\nstation will occupy their proper relative positions, and the aggregate\r\nresult will be letters corresponding to those perforated in the\r\ntransmission tape.\r\n\r\nEdison subsequently made still further improvements in this direction,\r\nby which he reduced the number of conducting wires to one, but the\r\nprinciples involved were analogous to the one just described.\r\n\r\nThis Roman letter system was in use for several years on lines between\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, and Washington, and was so efficient that a\r\nspeed of three thousand words a minute was attained on the line between\r\nthe two first-named cities.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as there were several proposed systems of rapid automatic\r\ntelegraphy in existence at the time Edison entered the field, but none\r\nof them in practical commercial use, it becomes a matter of interest to\r\ninquire wherein they were deficient, and what constituted the elements\r\nof Edison's success.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulties in the transmission of Morse characters had been\r\ntwo in number, the most serious of which was that on the receiving tape\r\nthe characters would be prolonged and run into one another, forming a\r\ndraggled line and thus rendering the message unintelligible. This arose\r\nfrom the fact that, on account of the rapid succession of the electric\r\nimpulses, there was not sufficient time between them for the electric\r\naction to cease entirely. Consequently the line could not clear itself,\r\nand became surcharged, as it were; the effect being an attenuated\r\nprolongation of each impulse as manifested in a weaker continuation of\r\nthe mark on the tape, thus making the whole message indistinct. These\r\nsecondary marks were called \"tailings.\"\r\n\r\nFor many years electricians had tried in vain to overcome this\r\ndifficulty. Edison devoted a great deal of thought and energy to the\r\nquestion, in the course of which he experimented through one hundred\r\nand twenty consecutive nights, in the year 1873, on the line between\r\nNew York and Washington. His solution of the problem was simple but\r\neffectual. It involved the principle of inductive compensation. In\r\na shunt circuit with the receiving instrument he introduced\r\nelectromagnets. The pulsations of current passed through the helices of\r\nthese magnets, producing an augmented marking effect upon the receiving\r\ntape, but upon the breaking of the current, the magnet, in discharging\r\nitself of the induced magnetism, would set up momentarily a\r\ncounter-current of opposite polarity. This neutralized the \"tailing\"\r\neffect by clearing the line between pulsations, thus allowing the\r\ntelegraphic characters to be clearly and distinctly outlined upon the\r\ntape. Further elaboration of this method was made later by the addition\r\nof rheostats, condensers, and local opposition batteries on long lines.\r\n\r\nThe other difficulty above referred to was one that had also occupied\r\nconsiderable thought and attention of many workers in the field, and\r\nrelated to the perforating of the dash in the transmission tape. It\r\ninvolved mechanical complications that seemed to be insurmountable, and\r\nup to the time Edison invented his perforating machine no really good\r\nmethod was available. He abandoned the attempt to cut dashes as such, in\r\nthe paper tape, but instead punched three round holes so arranged as\r\nto form a triangle. A concrete example is presented in the illustration\r\nbelow, which shows a piece of tape with perforations representing the\r\nword \"same.\"\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of this will be at once perceived when it is remembered\r\nthat the two little wheels running upon the drum of the transmitting\r\ninstrument were situated side by side, corresponding in distance to the\r\ntwo rows of holes. When a triangle of three holes, intended to form the\r\ndash, reached the wheels, one of them dropped into a lower hole. Before\r\nit could get out, the other wheel dropped into the hole at the apex of\r\nthe triangle, thus continuing the connection, which was still further\r\nprolonged by the first wheel dropping into the third hole. Thus, an\r\nextended contact was made, which, by transmitting a long impulse,\r\nresulted in the marking of a dash upon the receiving tape.\r\n\r\nThis method was in successful commercial use for some time in the early\r\nseventies, giving a speed of from three to four thousand words a minute\r\nover a single line, but later on was superseded by Edison's Roman letter\r\nsystem, above referred to.\r\n\r\nThe subject of automatic telegraphy received a vast amount of attention\r\nfrom inventors at the time it was in vogue. None was more earnest\r\nor indefatigable than Edison, who, during the progress of his\r\ninvestigations, took out thirty-eight patents on various inventions\r\nrelating thereto, some of them covering chemical solutions for the\r\nreceiving paper. This of itself was a subject of much importance and\r\na vast amount of research and labor was expended upon it. In the\r\nlaboratory note-books there are recorded thousands of experiments\r\nshowing that Edison's investigations not only included an enormous\r\nnumber of chemical salts and compounds, but also an exhaustive variety\r\nof plants, flowers, roots, herbs, and barks.\r\n\r\nIt seems inexplicable at first view that a system of telegraphy\r\nsufficiently rapid and economical to be practically available for\r\nimportant business correspondence should have fallen into disuse. This,\r\nhowever, is made clear--so far as concerns Edison's invention at any\r\nrate--in Chapter VIII of the preceding narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH Mr. Edison has taken no active part in the development of\r\nthe more modern wireless telegraphy, and his name has not occurred in\r\nconnection therewith, the underlying phenomena had been noted by him\r\nmany years in advance of the art, as will presently be explained. The\r\nauthors believe that this explanation will reveal a status of Edison in\r\nrelation to the subject that has thus far been unknown to the public.\r\n\r\nWhile the term \"wireless telegraphy,\" as now applied to the modern\r\nmethod of electrical communication between distant points without\r\nintervening conductors, is self-explanatory, it was also applicable,\r\nstrictly speaking, to the previous art of telegraphing to and from\r\nmoving trains, and between points not greatly remote from each other,\r\nand not connected together with wires.\r\n\r\nThe latter system (described in Chapter XXIII and in a succeeding\r\narticle of this Appendix) was based upon the phenomena of\r\nelectromagnetic or electrostatic induction between conductors separated\r\nby more or less space, whereby electric impulses of relatively low\r\npotential and low frequency set up in. one conductor were transmitted\r\ninductively across the air to another conductor, and there received\r\nthrough the medium of appropriate instruments connected therewith.\r\n\r\nAs distinguished from this system, however, modern wireless\r\ntelegraphy--so called--has its basis in the utilization of electric\r\nor ether waves in free space, such waves being set up by electric\r\noscillations, or surgings, of comparatively high potential and high\r\nfrequency, produced by the operation of suitable electrical apparatus.\r\nBroadly speaking, these oscillations arise from disruptive discharges of\r\nan induction coil, or other form of oscillator, across an air-gap, and\r\ntheir character is controlled by the manipulation of a special type of\r\ncircuit-breaking key, by means of which long and short discharges are\r\nproduced. The electric or etheric waves thereby set up are detected\r\nand received by another special form of apparatus more or less distant,\r\nwithout any intervening wires or conductors.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1875, Edison, while experimenting in his Newark laboratory,\r\ndiscovered a new manifestation of electricity through mysterious sparks\r\nwhich could be produced under conditions unknown up to that time.\r\nRecognizing at once the absolutely unique character of the phenomena, he\r\ncontinued his investigations enthusiastically over two mouths, finally\r\narriving at a correct conclusion as to the oscillatory nature of the\r\nhitherto unknown manifestations. Strange to say, however, the true\r\nimport and practical applicability of these phenomena did not occur to\r\nhis mind. Indeed, it was not until more than TWELVE YEARS AFTERWARD, in\r\n1887, upon the publication of the notable work of Prof. H. Hertz proving\r\nthe existence of electric waves in free space, that Edison realized the\r\nfact that the fundamental principle of aerial telegraphy had been within\r\nhis grasp in the winter of 1875; for although the work of Hertz was more\r\nprofound and mathematical than that of Edison, the principle involved\r\nand the phenomena observed were practically identical--in fact, it may\r\nbe remarked that some of the methods and experimental apparatus were\r\nquite similar, especially the \"dark box\" with micrometer adjustment,\r\nused by both in observing the spark. [25]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 25: During the period in which Edison exhibited\r\n     his lighting system at the Paris Exposition in 1881, his\r\n     representative, Mr. Charles Batchelor, repeated Edison's\r\n     remarkable experiments of the winter of 1875 for the benefit\r\n     of a great number of European savants, using with other\r\n     apparatus the original \"dark box\" with micrometer\r\n     adjustment.]\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest intention on the part of the authors to\r\ndetract in the least degree from the brilliant work of Hertz, but, on\r\nthe contrary, to ascribe to him the honor that is his due in having\r\ngiven mathematical direction and certainty to so important a discovery.\r\nThe adaptation of the principles thus elucidated and the subsequent\r\ndevelopment of the present wonderful art by Marconi, Branly, Lodge,\r\nSlaby, and others are now too well known to call for further remark at\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, that although Edison's early experiments in \"etheric\r\nforce\" called forth extensive comment and discussion in the public\r\nprints of the period, they seemed to have been generally overlooked\r\nwhen the work of Hertz was published. At a meeting of the Institution of\r\nElectrical Engineers, held in London on May 16, 1889, at which there\r\nwas a discussion on the celebrated paper of Prof. (Sir) Oliver Lodge on\r\n\"Lightning Conductors,\" however; the chairman, Sir William Thomson (Lord\r\nKelvin), made the following remarks:\r\n\r\n\"We all know how Faraday made himself a cage six feet in diameter, hung\r\nit up in mid-air in the theatre of the Royal Institution, went into it,\r\nand, as he said, lived in it and made experiments. It was a cage with\r\ntin-foil hanging all round it; it was not a complete metallic enclosing\r\nshell. Faraday had a powerful machine working in the neighborhood,\r\ngiving all varieties of gradual working-up and discharges by 'impulsive\r\nrush'; and whether it was a sudden discharge of ordinary insulated\r\nconductors, or of Leyden jars in the neighborhood outside the cage, or\r\nelectrification and discharge of the cage itself, he saw no effects on\r\nhis most delicate gold-leaf electroscopes in the interior. His attention\r\nwas not directed to look for Hertz sparks, or probably he might have\r\nfound them in the interior. Edison seems to have noticed something of\r\nthe kind in what he called the etheric force. His name 'etheric' may,\r\nthirteen years ago, have seemed to many people absurd. But now we are\r\nall beginning to call these inductive phenomena 'etheric.'\"\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary observations, let us now glance briefly at\r\nEdison's laboratory experiments, of which mention has been made.\r\n\r\nOh the first manifestation of the unusual phenomena in November, 1875,\r\nEdison's keenness of perception led him at once to believe that he had\r\ndiscovered a new force. Indeed, the earliest entry of this discovery in\r\nthe laboratory note-book bore that caption. After a few days of further\r\nexperiment and observation, however, he changed it to \"Etheric Force,\"\r\nand the further records thereof (all in Mr. Batchelor's handwriting)\r\nwere under that heading.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Edison's discovery created considerable attention at\r\nthe time, calling forth a storm of general ridicule and incredulity.\r\nBut a few scientific men of the period, whose experimental methods were\r\ncareful and exact, corroborated his deductions after obtaining similar\r\nphenomena by repeating his experiments with intelligent precision. Among\r\nthese was the late Dr. George M. Beard, a noted physicist, who entered\r\nenthusiastically into the investigation, and, in addition to a great\r\ndeal of independent experiment, spent much time with Edison at his\r\nlaboratory. Doctor Beard wrote a treatise of some length on the subject,\r\nin which he concurred with Edison's deduction that the phenomena\r\nwere the manifestation of oscillations, or rapidly reversing waves\r\nof electricity, which did not respond to the usual tests. Edison\r\nhad observed the tendency of this force to diffuse itself in various\r\ndirections through the air and through matter, hence the name \"Etheric\"\r\nthat he had provisionally applied to it.\r\n\r\nEdison's laboratory notes on this striking investigation are fascinating\r\nand voluminous, but cannot be reproduced in full for lack of space.\r\nIn view of the later practical application of the principles involved,\r\nhowever, the reader will probably be interested in perusing a few\r\nextracts therefrom as illustrated by facsimiles of the original sketches\r\nfrom the laboratory note-book.\r\n\r\nAs the full significance of the experiments shown by these extracts\r\nmay not be apparent to a lay reader, it may be stated by way of premise\r\nthat, ordinarily, a current only follows a closed circuit. An electric\r\nbell or electric light is a familiar instance of this rule. There is in\r\neach case an open (wire) circuit which is closed by pressing the button\r\nor turning the switch, thus making a complete and uninterrupted path in\r\nwhich the current may travel and do its work. Until the time of Edison's\r\ninvestigations of 1875, now under consideration, electricity had never\r\nbeen known to manifest itself except through a closed circuit. But, as\r\nthe reader will see from the following excerpts, Edison discovered a\r\nhitherto unknown phenomenon--namely, that under certain conditions the\r\nrule would be reversed and electricity would pass through space and\r\nthrough matter entirely unconnected with its point of origin. In other\r\nwords, he had found the forerunner of wireless telegraphy. Had he then\r\nrealized the full import of his discovery, all he needed was to increase\r\nthe strength of the waves and to provide a very sensitive detector, like\r\nthe coherer, in order to have anticipated the principal developments\r\nthat came many years afterward. With these explanatory observations, we\r\nwill now turn to the excerpts referred to, which are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"November 22, 1875. New Force.--In experimenting with a vibrator magnet\r\nconsisting of a bar of Stubb's steel fastened at one end and made to\r\nvibrate by means of a magnet, we noticed a spark coming from the cores\r\nof the magnet. This we have noticed often in relays, in stock-printers,\r\nwhen there were a little iron filings between the armature and core,\r\nand more often in our new electric pen, and we have always come to the\r\nconclusion that it was caused by strong induction. But when we noticed\r\nit on this vibrator it seemed so strong that it struck us forcibly there\r\nmight be something more than induction. We now found that if we touched\r\nany metallic part of the vibrator or magnet we got the spark. The larger\r\nthe body of iron touched to the vibrator the larger the spark. We now\r\nconnected a wire to X, the end of the vibrating rod, and we found we\r\ncould get a spark from it by touching a piece of iron to it, and one of\r\nthe most curious phenomena is that if you turn the wire around on itself\r\nand let the point of the wire touch any other portion of itself you\r\nget a spark. By connecting X to the gas-pipe we drew sparks from the\r\ngas-pipes in any part of the room by drawing an iron wire over the brass\r\njet of the cock. This is simply wonderful, and a good proof that the\r\ncause of the spark is a TRUE UNKNOWN FORCE.\"\r\n\r\n\"November 23, 1815. New Force.--The following very curious result was\r\nobtained with it. The vibrator shown in Fig. 1 and battery were placed\r\non insulated stands; and a wire connected to X (tried both copper and\r\niron) carried over to the stove about twenty feet distant. When the end\r\nof the wire was rubbed on the stove it gave out splendid sparks. When\r\npermanently connected to the stove, sparks could be drawn from the stove\r\nby a piece of wire held in the hand. The point X of vibrator was now\r\nconnected to the gas-pipe and still the sparks could be drawn from the\r\nstove.\"\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Put a coil of wire over the end of rod X and passed the ends of spool\r\nthrough galvanometer without affecting it in any way. Tried a 6-ohm\r\nspool add a 200-ohm. We now tried all the metals, touching each one in\r\nturn to the point X.\" [Here follows a list of metals and the character\r\nof spark obtained with each.]\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By increasing the battery from eight to twelve cells we get a spark\r\nwhen the vibrating magnet is shunted with 3 ohms. Cannot taste the least\r\nshock at B, yet between carbon points the spark is very vivid. As will\r\nbe seen, X has no connection with anything. With a glass rod four feet\r\nlong, well rubbed with a piece of silk over a hot stove, with a piece\r\nof battery carbon secured to one end, we received vivid sparks into the\r\ncarbon when the other end was held in the hand with the handkerchief,\r\nyet the galvanometer, chemical paper, the sense of shock in the tongue,\r\nand a gold-leaf electroscope which would diverge at two feet from a\r\nhalf-inch spark plate-glass machine were not affected in the least by\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"A piece of coal held to the wire showed faint sparks.\r\n\r\n\"We had a box made thus: whereby two points could be brought together\r\nwithin a dark box provided with an eyepiece. The points were iron, and\r\nwe found the sparks were very irregular. After testing some time two\r\nlead-pencils found more regular and very much more vivid. We then\r\nsubstituted the graphite points instead of iron.\" [26]\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 26: The dark box had micrometer screws for\r\n     delicate adjustment of the carbon points, and was thereafter\r\n     largely used in this series of investigations for better\r\n     study of the spark. When Mr. Edison's experiments were\r\n     repeated by Mr. Batchelor, who represented him at the Paris\r\n     Exposition of 1881, the dark box was employed for a similar\r\n     purpose.]\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter recording a considerable number of other experiments, the\r\nlaboratory notes go on to state:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"November 30, 1875. Etheric Force.--We found the addition of battery to\r\nthe Stubb's wire vibrator greatly increased the volume of spark. Several\r\npersons could obtain sparks from the gas-pipes at once, each spark being\r\nequal in volume and brilliancy to the spark drawn by a single person....\r\nEdison now grasped the (gas) pipe, and with the other hand holding a\r\npiece of metal, he touched several other metallic substances, obtained\r\nsparks, showing that the force passed through his body.\"\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\"December 3, 1875. Etheric Force.--Charley Edison hung to the gas-pipe\r\nwith feet above the floor, and with a knife got a spark from the pipe he\r\nwas hanging on. We now took the wire from the vibrator in one hand\r\nand stood on a block of paraffin eighteen inches square and six inches\r\nthick; holding a knife in the other hand, we drew sparks from the\r\nstove-pipe. We now tried the crucial test of passing the etheric current\r\nthrough the sciatic nerve of a frog just killed. Previous to trying, we\r\ntested its sensibility by the current from a single Bunsen cell. We\r\nput in resistance up to 500,000 ohms, and the twitching was still\r\nperceptible. We tried the induced current from our induction coil having\r\none cell on primary,, the spark jumping about one-fiftieth of an inch,\r\nthe terminal of the secondary connected to the frog and it straightened\r\nout with violence. We arranged frog's legs to pass etheric force\r\nthrough. We placed legs on an inverted beaker, and held the two ends\r\nof the wires on glass rods eight inches long. On connecting one to the\r\nsciatic nerve and the other to the fleshy part of the leg no movement\r\ncould be discerned, although brilliant sparks could be obtained on the\r\ngraphite points when the frog was in circuit. Doctor Beard was present\r\nwhen this was tried.\"\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\"December 5, 1875. Etheric Force.--Three persons grasping hands and\r\nstanding upon blocks of paraffin twelve inches square and six thick drew\r\nsparks from the adjoining stove when another person touched the sounder\r\nwith any piece of metal.... A galvanoscopic frog giving contractions\r\nwith one cell through two water rheostats was then placed in circuit.\r\nWhen the wires from the vibrator and the gas-pipe were connected, slight\r\ncontractions were noted, sometimes very plain and marked, showing the\r\napparent presence of electricity, which from the high insulation seemed\r\nimprobable. Doctor Beard, who was present, inferred from the way the\r\nleg contracted that it moved on both opening and closing the circuit.\r\nTo test this we disconnected the wire between the frog and battery, and\r\nplaced, instead of a vibrating sounder, a simple Morse key and a sounder\r\ntaking the 'etheric' from armature. The spark was now tested in dark box\r\nand found to be very strong. It was then connected to the nerves of the\r\nfrog, BUT NO MOVEMENT OF ANY KIND COULD BE DETECTED UPON WORKING THE\r\nKEY, although the brilliancy and power of the spark were undiminished.\r\nThe thought then occurred to Edison that the movement of the frog was\r\ndue to mechanical vibrations from the vibrator (which gives probably two\r\nhundred and fifty vibrations per second), passing through the wires\r\nand irritating the sensitive nerves of the frog. Upon disconnecting\r\nthe battery wires and holding a tuning-fork giving three hundred\r\nand twenty-six vibrations per second to the base of the sounder, the\r\nvibrations over the wire made the frog contract nearly every time....\r\nThe contraction of the frog's legs may with considerable safety be said\r\nto be caused by these mechanical vibrations being transmitted through\r\nthe conducting wires.\"\r\n\r\nEdison thought that the longitudinal vibrations caused by the sounder\r\nproduced a more marked effect, and proceeded to try out his theory. The\r\nvery next entry in the laboratory note-book bears the same date as the\r\nabove (December 5, 1875), and is entitled \"Longitudinal Vibrations,\" and\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We took a long iron wire one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter and\r\nrubbed it lengthways with a piece of leather with resin on for about\r\nthree feet, backward and forward. About ten feet away we applied the\r\nwire to the back of the neck and it gives a horrible sensation, showing\r\nthe vibrations conducted through the wire.\"\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe following experiment illustrates notably the movement of the\r\nelectric waves through free space:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"December 26, 1875. Etheric Force.--An experiment tried to-night gives a\r\ncurious result. A is a vibrator, B, C, D, E are sheets of tin-foil hung\r\non insulating stands. The sheets are about twelve by eight inches. B and\r\nC are twenty-six inches apart, C and D forty-eight inches and D and E\r\ntwenty-six inches. B is connected to the vibrator and E to point in\r\ndark box, the other point to ground. We received sparks at intervals,\r\nalthough insulated by such space.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the above our extracts must close, although we have given but a few\r\nof the interesting experiments tried at the time. It will be noticed,\r\nhowever, that these records show much progression in a little over a\r\nmonth. Just after the item last above extracted, the Edison shop became\r\ngreatly rushed on telegraphic inventions, and not many months afterward\r\ncame the removal to Menlo Park; hence the etheric-force investigations\r\nwere side-tracked for other matters deemed to be more important at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nDoctor Beard in his previously mentioned treatise refers, on page 27, to\r\nthe views of others who have repeated Edison's experiments and observed\r\nthe phenomena, and in a foot-note says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Professor Houston, of Philadelphia, among others, has repeated some of\r\nthese physical experiments, has adopted in full and after but a partial\r\nstudy of the subject, the hypothesis of rapidly reversed electricity\r\nas suggested in my letter to the Tribune of December 8th, and further\r\nclaims priority of discovery, because he observed the spark of this when\r\nexperimenting with a Ruhmkorff coil four years ago. To this claim, if\r\nit be seriously entertained, the obvious reply is that thousands of\r\npersons, probably, had seen this spark before it was DISCOVERED by Mr.\r\nEdison; it had been seen by Professor Nipher, who supposed, and still\r\nsupposes, it is the spark of the extra current; it has been seen by\r\nmy friend, Prof. J. E. Smith, who assumed, as he tells me, without\r\nexamination, that it was inductive electricity breaking through bad\r\ninsulation; it had been seen, as has been stated, by Mr. Edison many\r\ntimes before he thought it worthy of study, it was undoubtedly seen by\r\nProfessor Houston, who, like so many others, failed to even suspect\r\nits meaning and thus missed an important discovery. The honor of a\r\nscientific discovery belongs, not to him who first sees a thing, but\r\nto him who first sees it with expert eyes; not to him even who drops\r\nan original suggestion, but to him who first makes, that suggestion\r\nfruitful of results. If to see with the eyes a phenomenon is to discover\r\nthe law of which that phenomenon is a part, then every schoolboy who,\r\nbefore the time of Newton, ever saw an apple fall, was a discoverer of\r\nthe law of gravitation....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEdison took out only one patent on long-distance telegraphy without\r\nwires. While the principle involved therein (induction) was not\r\nprecisely analogous to the above, or to the present system of wireless\r\ntelegraphy, it was a step forward in the progress of the art. The\r\napplication was filed May 23, 1885, at the time he was working on\r\ninduction telegraphy (two years before the publication of the work of\r\nHertz), but the patent (No. 465,971) was not issued until December\r\n29, 1891. In 1903 it was purchased from him by the Marconi Wireless\r\nTelegraph Company. Edison has always had a great admiration for Marconi\r\nand his work, and a warm friendship exists between the two men. During\r\nthe formative period of the Marconi Company attempts were made to\r\ninfluence Edison to sell this patent to an opposing concern, but his\r\nregard for Marconi and belief in the fundamental nature of his work were\r\nso strong that he refused flatly, because in the hands of an enemy the\r\npatent might be used inimically to Marconi's interests.\r\n\r\nEdison's ideas, as expressed in the specifications of this patent, show\r\nvery clearly the close analogy of his system to that now in vogue.\r\nAs they were filed in the Patent Office several years before the\r\npossibility of wireless telegraphy was suspected, it will undoubtedly be\r\nof interest to give the following extract therefrom:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have discovered that if sufficient elevation be obtained to overcome\r\nthe curvature of the earth's surface and to reduce to the minimum the\r\nearth's absorption, electric telegraphing or signalling between\r\ndistant points can be carried on by induction without the use of wires\r\nconnecting such distant points. This discovery is especially applicable\r\nto telegraphing across bodies of water, thus avoiding the use of\r\nsubmarine cables, or for communicating between vessels at sea, or\r\nbetween vessels at sea and points on land, but it is also applicable\r\nto electric communication between distant points on land, it being\r\nnecessary, however, on land (with the exception of communication over\r\nopen prairie) to increase the elevation in order to reduce to the\r\nminimum the induction-absorbing effect of houses, trees, and elevations\r\nin the land itself. At sea from an elevation of one hundred feet I can\r\ncommunicate electrically a great distance, and since this elevation\r\nor one sufficiently high can be had by utilizing the masts of ships,\r\nsignals can be sent and received between ships separated a considerable\r\ndistance, and by repeating the signals from ship to ship communication\r\ncan be established between points at any distance apart or across the\r\nlargest seas and even oceans. The collision of ships in fogs can be\r\nprevented by this character of signalling, by the use of which, also,\r\nthe safety of a ship in approaching a dangerous coast in foggy weather\r\ncan be assured. In communicating between points on land, poles of great\r\nheight can be used, or captive balloons. At these elevated points,\r\nwhether upon the masts of ships, upon poles or balloons, condensing\r\nsurfaces of metal or other conductor of electricity are located. Each\r\ncondensing surface is connected with earth by an electrical conducting\r\nwire. On land this earth connection would be one of usual character in\r\ntelegraphy. At sea the wire would run to one or more metal plates on the\r\nbottom of the vessel, where the earth connection would be made with the\r\nwater. The high-resistance secondary circuit of an induction coil is\r\nlocated in circuit between the condensing surface and the ground. The\r\nprimary circuit of the induction coil includes a battery and a device\r\nfor transmitting signals, which may be a revolving circuit-breaker\r\noperated continually by a motor of any suitable kind, either electrical\r\nor mechanical, and a key normally short-circuiting the circuit-breaker\r\nor secondary coil. For receiving signals I locate in said circuit\r\nbetween the condensing surface and the ground a diaphragm sounder, which\r\nis preferably one of my electromotograph telephone receivers. The key\r\nnormally short-circuiting the revolving circuit-breaker, no impulses are\r\nproduced in the induction coil until the key is depressed, when a large\r\nnumber of impulses are produced in the primary, and by means of the\r\nsecondary corresponding impulses or variations in tension are produced\r\nat the elevated condensing surface, producing thereat electrostatic\r\nimpulses. These electrostatic impulses are transmitted inductively\r\nto the elevated condensing surface at the distant point, and are made\r\naudible by the electromotograph connected in the ground circuit with\r\nsuch distant condensing surface.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations are reduced facsimiles of the drawings\r\nattached to the above patent, No. 465,971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE ELECTROMOTOGRAPH\r\n\r\nIN solving a problem that at the time was thought to be insurmountable,\r\nand in the adaptability of its principles to the successful overcoming\r\nof apparently insuperable difficulties subsequently arising in other\r\nlines of work, this invention is one of the most remarkable of the many\r\nthat Edison has made in his long career as an inventor.\r\n\r\nThe object primarily sought to be accomplished was the repeating of\r\ntelegraphic signals from a distance without the aid of a galvanometer\r\nor an electromagnetic relay, to overcome the claims of the Page patent\r\nreferred to in the preceding narrative. This object was achieved in the\r\ndevice described in Edison's basic patent No. 158,787, issued January\r\n19, 1875, by the substitution of friction and anti-friction for the\r\npresence and absence of magnetism in a regulation relay.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, parenthetically, for the benefit of the lay\r\nreader, that in telegraphy the device known as the relay is a receiving\r\ninstrument containing an electromagnet adapted to respond to the weak\r\nline-current. Its armature moves in accordance with electrical impulses,\r\nor signals, transmitted from a distance, and, in so responding, operates\r\nmechanically to alternately close and open a separate local circuit\r\nin which there is a sounder and a powerful battery. When used for true\r\nrelaying purposes the signals received from a distance are in turn\r\nrepeated over the next section of the line, the powerful local battery\r\nfurnishing current for this purpose. As this causes a loud repetition\r\nof the original signals, it will be seen that relaying is an economic\r\nmethod of extending a telegraph circuit beyond the natural limits of its\r\nbattery power.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Edison's invention, as related in Chapter IX of the\r\npreceding narrative, there existed no other known method than the one\r\njust described for the repetition of transmitted signals, thus limiting\r\nthe application of telegraphy to the pleasure of those who might own any\r\npatent controlling the relay, except on simple circuits where a single\r\nbattery was sufficient. Edison's previous discovery of differential\r\nfriction of surfaces through electrochemical decomposition was now\r\nadapted by him to produce motion at the end of a circuit without\r\nthe intervention of an electromagnet. In other words, he invented a\r\ntelegraph instrument having a vibrator controlled by electrochemical\r\ndecomposition, to take the place of a vibrating armature operated by an\r\nelectromagnet, and thus opened an entirely new and unsuspected avenue in\r\nthe art.\r\n\r\nEdison's electromotograph comprised an ingeniously arranged apparatus in\r\nwhich two surfaces, normally in contact with each other, were caused\r\nto alternately adhere by friction or slip by reason of electrochemical\r\ndecomposition. One of these surfaces consisted of a small drum or\r\ncylinder of chalk, which was kept in a moistened condition with a\r\nsuitable chemical solution, and adapted to revolve continuously by\r\nclockwork. The other surface consisted of a small pad which rested with\r\nfrictional pressure on the periphery of the drum. This pad was carried\r\non the end of a vibrating arm whose lateral movement was limited between\r\ntwo adjustable points. Normally, the frictional pressure between the\r\ndrum and pad would carry the latter with the former as it revolved, but\r\nif the friction were removed a spring on the end of the vibrator arm\r\nwould draw it back to its starting-place.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the chalk drum was electrically connected with one pole of\r\nan incoming telegraph circuit, and the vibrating arm and pad with the\r\nother pole. When the drum rotated, the friction of the pad carried the\r\nvibrating arm forward, but an electrical impulse coming over the line\r\nwould decompose the chemical solution with which the drum was moistened,\r\ncausing an effect similar to lubrication, and thus allowing the pad to\r\nslip backward freely in response to the pull of its retractile spring.\r\nThe frictional movements of the pad with the drum were comparatively\r\nlong or short, and corresponded with the length of the impulses sent in\r\nover the line. Thus, the transmission of Morse dots and dashes by the\r\ndistant operator resulted in movements of corresponding length by the\r\nfrictional pad and vibrating arm.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the gist of the ingenious way in which Edison\r\nsubstituted the action of electrochemical decomposition for that of the\r\nelectromagnet to operate a relay. The actual relaying was accomplished\r\nthrough the medium of two contacts making connection with the local\r\nor relay circuit. One of these contacts was fixed, while the other was\r\ncarried by the vibrating arm; and, as the latter made its forward and\r\nbackward movements, these contacts were alternately brought together or\r\nseparated, thus throwing in and out of circuit the battery and sounder\r\nin the local circuit and causing a repetition of the incoming signals.\r\nThe other side of the local circuit was permanently connected to an\r\ninsulated block on the vibrator. This device not only worked with great\r\nrapidity, but was extremely sensitive, and would respond to currents\r\ntoo weak to affect the most delicate electromagnetic relay. It should\r\nbe stated that Edison did not confine himself to the working of the\r\nelectromotograph by the slipping of surfaces through the action of\r\nincoming current, but by varying the character of the surfaces in\r\ncontact the frictional effect might be intensified by the electrical\r\ncurrent. In such a case the movements would be the reverse of\r\nthose above indicated, but the end sought--namely, the relaying of\r\nmessages--would be attained with the same certainty.\r\n\r\nWhile the principal object of this invention was to accomplish the\r\nrepetition of signals without the aid of an electromagnetic relay, the\r\ninstrument devised by Edison was capable of use as a recorder also, by\r\nemploying a small wheel inked by a fountain wheel and attached to the\r\nvibrating arm through suitable mechanism. By means of this adjunct the\r\ndashes and dots of the transmitted impulses could be recorded upon a\r\npaper ribbon passing continuously over the drum.\r\n\r\nThe electromotograph is shown diagrammatically in Figs. 1 and 2, in plan\r\nand vertical section respectively. The reference letters in each case\r\nindicate identical parts: A being the chalk drum, B the paper tape, C\r\nthe auxiliary cylinder, D the vibrating arm, E the frictional pad, F the\r\nspring, G and H the two contacts, I and J the two wires leading to local\r\ncircuit, K a battery, and L an ordinary telegraph key. The two last\r\nnamed, K and L, are shown to make the sketch complete but in practice\r\nwould be at the transmitting end, which might be hundreds of miles\r\naway. It will be understood, of course, that the electromotograph is a\r\nreceiving and relaying instrument.\r\n\r\nAnother notable use of the electromotograph principle was in its\r\nadaptation to the receiver in Edison's loud-speaking telephone, on which\r\nUnited States Patent No. 221,957 was issued November 25, 1879. A chalk\r\ncylinder moistened with a chemical solution was revolved by hand or\r\na small motor. Resting on the cylinder was a palladium-faced pen or\r\nspring, which was attached to a mica diaphragm in a resonator. The\r\ncurrent passed from the main line through the pen to the chalk and to\r\nthe battery. The sound-waves impinging upon the distant transmitter\r\nvaried the resistance of the carbon button therein, thus causing\r\ncorresponding variations in the strength of the battery current. These\r\nvariations, passing through the chalk cylinder produced more or less\r\nelectrochemical decomposition, which in turn caused differences of\r\nadhesion between the pen and cylinder and hence gave rise to mechanical\r\nvibrations of the diaphragm by reason of which the speaker's words were\r\nreproduced. Telephones so operated repeated speaking and singing in\r\nvery loud tones. In one instance, spoken words and the singing of songs\r\noriginating at a distance were heard perfectly by an audience of over\r\nfive thousand people.\r\n\r\nThe loud-speaking telephone is shown in section, diagrammatically,\r\nin the sketch (Fig. 3), in which A is the chalk cylinder mounted on\r\na shaft, B. The palladium-faced pen or spring, C, is connected to\r\ndiaphragm D. The instrument in its commercial form is shown in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE TELEPHONE\r\n\r\nON April 27, 1877, Edison filed in the United States Patent Office an\r\napplication for a patent on a telephone, and on May 3, 1892, more\r\nthan fifteen years afterward, Patent No. 474,230 was granted thereon.\r\nNumerous other patents have been issued to him for improvements in\r\ntelephones, but the one above specified may be considered as the\r\nmost important of them, since it is the one that first discloses the\r\nprinciple of the carbon transmitter.\r\n\r\nThis patent embodies but two claims, which are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"1. In a speaking-telegraph transmitter, the combination of a metallic\r\ndiaphragm and disk of plumbago or equivalent material, the contiguous\r\nfaces of said disk and diaphragm being in contact, substantially as\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\"2. As a means for effecting a varying surface contact in the circuit of\r\na speaking-telegraph transmitter, the combination of two electrodes,\r\none of plumbago or similar material, and both having broad surfaces in\r\nvibratory contact with each other, substantially as described.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advance that was brought about by Edison's carbon transmitter will\r\nbe more apparent if we glance first at the state of the art of telephony\r\nprior to his invention.\r\n\r\nBell was undoubtedly the first inventor of the art of transmitting\r\nspeech over an electric circuit, but, with his particular form of\r\ntelephone, the field was circumscribed. Bell's telephone is shown in the\r\ndiagrammatic sectional sketch (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nIn the drawing M is a bar magnet contained in the rubber case, L. A\r\nbobbin, or coil of wire, B, surrounds one end of the magnet. A diaphragm\r\nof soft iron is shown at D, and E is the mouthpiece. The wire terminals\r\nof the coil, B, connect with the binding screws, C C.\r\n\r\nThe next illustration shows a pair of such telephones connected for use,\r\nthe working parts only being designated by the above reference letters.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the wire terminals are here put to their proper\r\nuses, two being joined together to form a line of communication, and the\r\nother two being respectively connected to \"ground.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if we imagine a person at each one of the instruments (Fig. 2) we\r\nshall find that when one of them speaks the sound vibrations impinge\r\nupon the diaphragm and cause it to act as a vibrating armature. By\r\nreason of its vibrations, this diaphragm induces very weak electric\r\nimpulses in the magnetic coil. These impulses, according to Bell's\r\ntheory, correspond in form to the sound-waves, and, passing over the\r\nline, energize the magnet coil at the receiving end, thus giving rise to\r\ncorresponding variations in magnetism by reason of which the receiving\r\ndiaphragm is similarly vibrated so as to reproduce the sounds. A single\r\napparatus at each end is therefore sufficient, performing the double\r\nfunction of transmitter and receiver. It will be noticed that in this\r\narrangement no battery is used The strength of the impulses transmitted\r\nis therefore limited to that of the necessarily weak induction currents\r\ngenerated by the original sounds minus any loss arising by reason of\r\nresistance in the line.\r\n\r\nEdison's carbon transmitter overcame this vital or limiting weakness\r\nby providing for independent power on the transmission circuit, and by\r\nintroducing the principle of varying the resistance of that circuit with\r\nchanges in the pressure. With Edison's telephone there is used a closed\r\ncircuit on which a battery current constantly flows, and in that\r\ncircuit is a pair of electrodes, one or both of which is carbon. These\r\nelectrodes are always in contact with a certain initial pressure,\r\nso that current will be always flowing over the circuit. One of the\r\nelectrodes is connected with the diaphragm on which the sound-waves\r\nimpinge, and the vibrations of this diaphragm cause corresponding\r\nvariations in pressure between the electrodes, and thereby effect\r\nsimilar variations in the current which is passing over the line to the\r\nreceiving end. This current, flowing around the receiving magnet, causes\r\ncorresponding impulses therein, which, acting upon its diaphragm, effect\r\na reproduction of the original vibrations and hence of the original\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the essential difference is that with Bell's telephone\r\nthe sound-waves themselves generate the electric impulses, which are\r\ntherefore extremely faint. With Edison's telephone the sound-waves\r\nsimply actuate an electric valve, so to speak, and permit variations in\r\na current of any desired strength.\r\n\r\nA second distinction between the two telephones is this: With the Bell\r\napparatus the very weak electric impulses generated by the vibration of\r\nthe transmitting diaphragm pass over the entire line to the receiving\r\nend, and, in consequence, the possible length of line is limited to\r\na few miles, even under ideal conditions. With Edison's telephone the\r\nbattery current does not flow on the main line, but passes through\r\nthe primary circuit of an induction-coil, from the secondary of which\r\ncorresponding impulses of enormously higher potential are sent out on\r\nthe main line to the receiving end. In consequence, the line may be\r\nhundreds of miles in length. No modern telephone system is in use to-day\r\nthat does not use these characteristic features: the varying resistance\r\nand the induction-coil. The system inaugurated by Edison is shown by the\r\ndiagram (Fig. 3), in which the carbon transmitter, the induction-coil,\r\nthe line, and the distant receiver are respectively indicated.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 4 an early form of the Edison carbon transmitter is represented\r\nin sectional view.\r\n\r\nThe carbon disk is represented by the black portion, E, near the\r\ndiaphragm, A, placed between two platinum plates D and G, which are\r\nconnected in the battery circuit, as shown by the lines. A small\r\npiece of rubber tubing, B, is attached to the centre of the metallic\r\ndiaphragm, and presses lightly against an ivory piece, F, which is\r\nplaced directly over one of the platinum plates. Whenever, therefore,\r\nany motion is given to the diaphragm, it is immediately followed by a\r\ncorresponding pressure upon the carbon, and by a change of resistance in\r\nthe latter, as described above.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the position which Edison occupies in\r\nthe telephone art from a legal standpoint. To this end the reader's\r\nattention is called to a few extracts from a decision of Judge Brown\r\nin two suits brought in the United States Circuit Court, District\r\nof Massachusetts, by the American Bell Telephone Company against the\r\nNational Telephone Manufacturing Company, et al., and Century Telephone\r\nCompany, et al., reported in Federal Reporter, 109, page 976, et seq.\r\nThese suits were brought on the Berliner patent, which, it was claimed,\r\ncovered broadly the electrical transmission of speech by variations of\r\npressure between opposing electrodes in constant contact. The Berliner\r\npatent was declared invalid, and in the course of a long and exhaustive\r\nopinion, in which the state of art and the work of Bell, Edison,\r\nBerliner, and others was fully discussed, the learned Judge made the\r\nfollowing remarks: \"The carbon electrode was the invention of Edison....\r\nEdison preceded Berliner in the transmission of speech.... The carbon\r\ntransmitter was an experimental invention of a very high order of\r\nmerit.... Edison, by countless experiments, succeeded in advancing the\r\nart. . . . That Edison did produce speech with solid electrodes before\r\nBerliner is clearly proven.... The use of carbon in a transmitter is,\r\nbeyond controversy, the invention of Edison. Edison was the first to\r\nmake apparatus in which carbon was used as one of the electrodes....\r\nThe carbon transmitter displaced Bell's magnetic transmitter, and,\r\nunder several forms of construction, remains the only commercial\r\ninstrument.... The advance in the art was due to the carbon electrode of\r\nEdison.... It is conceded that the Edison transmitter as apparatus is a\r\nvery important invention.... An immense amount of painstaking and highly\r\ningenious experiment preceded Edison's successful result. The discovery\r\nof the availability of carbon was unquestionably invention, and it\r\nresulted in the 'first practical success in the art.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. EDISON'S TASIMETER\r\n\r\nTHIS interesting and remarkable device is one of Edison's many\r\ninventions not generally known to the public at large, chiefly because\r\nthe range of its application has been limited to the higher branches of\r\nscience. He never applied for a patent on the instrument, but dedicated\r\nit to the public.\r\n\r\nThe device was primarily intended for use in detecting and measuring\r\ninfinitesimal degrees of temperature, however remote, and its conception\r\nfollowed Edison's researches on the carbon telephone transmitter. Its\r\nprinciple depends upon the variable resistance of carbon in accordance\r\nwith the degree of pressure to which it is subjected. By means of\r\nthis instrument, pressures that are otherwise inappreciable and\r\nundiscoverable may be observed and indicated.\r\n\r\nThe detection of small variations of temperatures is brought about\r\nthrough the changes which heat or cold will produce in a sensitive\r\nmaterial placed in contact with a carbon button, which is put in circuit\r\nwith a battery and delicate galvanometer. In the sketch (Fig. 1) there\r\nis illustrated, partly in section, the form of tasimeter which Edison\r\ntook with him to Rawlins, Wyoming, in July, 1878, on the expedition to\r\nobserve the total eclipse of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe substance on whose expansion the working of the instrument depends\r\nis a strip of some material extremely sensitive to heat, such as\r\nvulcanite. shown at A, and firmly clamped at B. Its lower end fits into\r\na slot in a metal plate, C, which in turn rests upon a carbon button.\r\nThis latter and the metal plate are connected in an electric circuit\r\nwhich includes a battery and a sensitive galvanometer. A vulcanite or\r\nother strip is easily affected by differences of temperature,\r\nexpanding and contracting by reason of the minutest changes. Thus, an\r\ninfinitesimal variation in its length through expansion or contraction\r\nchanges the pressure on the carbon and affects the resistance of the\r\ncircuit to a corresponding degree, thereby causing a deflection of\r\nthe galvanometer; a movement of the needle in one direction denoting\r\nexpansion, and in the other contraction. The strip, A, is first put\r\nunder a slight pressure, deflecting the needle a few degrees from zero.\r\nAny subsequent expansion or contraction of the strip may readily\r\nbe noted by further movements of the needle. In practice, and for\r\nmeasurements of a very delicate nature, the tasimeter is inserted in one\r\narm of a Wheatstone bridge, as shown at A in the diagram (Fig. 2). The\r\ngalvanometer is shown at B in the bridge wire, and at C, D, and E there\r\nare shown the resistances in the other arms of the bridge, which are\r\nadjusted to equal the resistance of the tasimeter circuit. The battery\r\nis shown at F. This arrangement tends to obviate any misleading\r\ndeflections that might arise through changes in the battery.\r\n\r\nThe dial on the front of the instrument is intended to indicate the\r\nexact amount of physical expansion or contraction of the strip. This is\r\nascertained by means of a micrometer screw, S, which moves a needle, T,\r\nin front of the dial. This screw engages with a second and similar screw\r\nwhich is so arranged as to move the strip of vulcanite up or down. After\r\na galvanometer deflection has been obtained through the expansion or\r\ncontraction of the strip by reason of a change of temperature, a similar\r\ndeflection is obtained mechanically by turning the screw, S, one way or\r\nthe other. This causes the vulcanite strip to press more or less\r\nupon the carbon button, and thus produces the desired change in the\r\nresistance of the circuit. When the galvanometer shows the desired\r\ndeflection, the needle, T, will indicate upon the dial, in decimal\r\nfractions of an inch, the exact distance through which the strip has\r\nbeen moved.\r\n\r\nWith such an instrument as the above, Edison demonstrated the existence\r\nof heat in the corona at the above-mentioned total eclipse of the sun,\r\nbut exact determinations could not be made at that time, because the\r\ntasimeter adjustment was too delicate, and at the best the galvanometer\r\ndeflections were so marked that they could not be kept within the\r\nlimits of the scale. The sensitiveness of the instrument may be easily\r\ncomprehended when it is stated that the heat of the hand thirty feet\r\naway from the cone-like funnel of the tasimeter will so affect the\r\ngalvanometer as to cause the spot of light to leave the scale.\r\n\r\nThis instrument can also be used to indicate minute changes of\r\nmoisture in the air by substituting a strip of gelatine in place of the\r\nvulcanite. When so arranged a moistened piece of paper held several feet\r\naway will cause a minute expansion of the gelatine strip, which\r\neffects a pressure on the carbon, and causes a variation in the circuit\r\nsufficient to throw the spot of light from the galvanometer mirror off\r\nthe scale.\r\n\r\nThe tasimeter has been used to demonstrate heat from remote stars\r\n(suns), such as Arcturus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH\r\n\r\nTHE first patent that was ever granted on a device for permanently\r\nrecording the human voice and other sounds, and for reproducing the same\r\naudibly at any future time, was United States Patent No. 200,251, issued\r\nto Thomas A. Edison on February 19, 1878, the application having\r\nbeen filed December 24, 1877. It is worthy of note that no references\r\nwhatever were cited against the application while under examination in\r\nthe Patent Office. This invention therefore, marked the very beginning\r\nof an entirely new art, which, with the new industries attendant upon\r\nits development, has since grown to occupy a position of worldwide\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nThat the invention was of a truly fundamental character is also evident\r\nfrom the fact that although all \"talking-machines\" of to-day differ very\r\nwidely in refinement from the first crude but successful phonograph of\r\nEdison, their performance is absolutely dependent upon the employment of\r\nthe principles stated by him in his Patent No. 200,251. Quoting from the\r\nspecification attached to this patent, we find that Edison said:\r\n\r\n\"The invention consists in arranging a plate, diaphragm or other\r\nflexible body capable of being vibrated by the human voice or other\r\nsounds, in conjunction with a material capable of registering the\r\nmovements of such vibrating body by embossing or indenting or altering\r\nsuch material, in such a manner that such register marks will be\r\nsufficient to cause a second vibrating plate or body to be set in motion\r\nby them, and thus reproduce the motions of the first vibrating body.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be at once obvious that these words describe perfectly the\r\nbasic principle of every modern phonograph or other talking-machine,\r\nirrespective of its manufacture or trade name.\r\n\r\nEdison's first model of the phonograph is shown in the following\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of a metallic cylinder having a helical indenting groove\r\ncut upon it from end to end. This cylinder was mounted on a shaft\r\nsupported on two standards. This shaft at one end was fitted with a\r\nhandle, by means of which the cylinder was rotated. There were two\r\ndiaphragms, one on each side of the cylinder, one being for recording\r\nand the other for reproducing speech or other sounds. Each diaphragm\r\nhad attached to it a needle. By means of the needle attached to the\r\nrecording diaphragm, indentations were made in a sheet of tin-foil\r\nstretched over the peripheral surface of the cylinder when the diaphragm\r\nwas vibrated by reason of speech or other sounds. The needle on\r\nthe other diaphragm subsequently followed these indentations, thus\r\nreproducing the original sounds.\r\n\r\nCrude as this first model appears in comparison with machines of later\r\ndevelopment and refinement, it embodied their fundamental essentials,\r\nand was in fact a complete, practical phonograph from the first moment\r\nof its operation.\r\n\r\nThe next step toward the evolution of the improved phonograph of to-day\r\nwas another form of tin-foil machine, as seen in the illustration.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that this was merely an elaborated form of the first\r\nmodel, and embodied several mechanical modifications, among which was\r\nthe employment of only one diaphragm for recording and reproducing.\r\nSuch was the general type of phonograph used for exhibition purposes\r\nin America and other countries in the three or four years immediately\r\nsucceeding the date of this invention.\r\n\r\nIn operating the machine the recording diaphragm was advanced nearly\r\nto the cylinder, so that as the diaphragm was vibrated by the voice the\r\nneedle would prick or indent a wave-like record in the tin-foil that\r\nwas on the cylinder. The cylinder was constantly turned during the\r\nrecording, and in turning, was simultaneously moved forward. Thus the\r\nrecord would be formed on the tin-foil in a continuous spiral line.\r\nTo reproduce this record it was only necessary to again start at the\r\nbeginning and cause the needle to retrace its path in the spiral line.\r\nThe needle, in passing rapidly in contact with the recorded waves, was\r\nvibrated up and down, causing corresponding vibrations of the diaphragm.\r\nIn this way sound-waves similar to those caused by the original sounds\r\nwould be set up in the air, thus reproducing the original speech.\r\n\r\nThe modern phonograph operates in a precisely similar way, the only\r\ndifference being in details of refinement. Instead of tin-foil, a wax\r\ncylinder is employed, the record being cut thereon by a cutting-tool\r\nattached to a diaphragm, while the reproduction is effected by means of\r\na blunt stylus similarly attached.\r\n\r\nThe cutting-tool and stylus are devices made of sapphire, a gem next in\r\nhardness to a diamond, and they have to be cut and formed to an exact\r\nnicety by means of diamond dust, most of the work being performed under\r\nhigh-powered microscopes. The minute proportions of these devices will\r\nbe apparent by a glance at the accompanying illustrations, in which the\r\nobject on the left represents a common pin, and the objects on the right\r\nthe cutting-tool and reproducing stylus, all actual sizes.\r\n\r\nIn the next illustration (Fig. 4) there is shown in the upper sketch,\r\ngreatly magnified, the cutting or recording tool in the act of forming\r\nthe record, being vibrated rapidly by the diaphragm; and in the lower\r\nsketch, similarly enlarged, a representation of the stylus travelling\r\nover the record thus made, in the act of effecting a reproduction.\r\n\r\nFrom the late summer of 1878 and to the fall of 1887 Edison was\r\nintensely busy on the electric light, electric railway, and other\r\nproblems, and virtually gave no attention to the phonograph. Hence,\r\njust prior to the latter-named period the instrument was still in its\r\ntin-foil age; but he then began to devote serious attention to the\r\ndevelopment of an improved type that should be of greater commercial\r\nimportance. The practical results are too well known to call for further\r\ncomment. That his efforts were not limited in extent may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that since the fall of 1887 to the present writing he has\r\nbeen granted in the United States one hundred and four patents relating\r\nto the phonograph and its accessories.\r\n\r\nInteresting as the numerous inventions are, it would be a work of\r\nsupererogation to digest all these patents in the present pages, as they\r\nrepresent not only the inception but also the gradual development and\r\ngrowth of the wax-record type of phonograph from its infancy to the\r\npresent perfected machine and records now so widely known all over the\r\nworld. From among these many inventions, however, we will select two\r\nor three as examples of ingenuity and importance in their bearing upon\r\npresent perfection of results.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties of reproduction for many years was the trouble\r\nexperienced in keeping the stylus in perfect engagement with the\r\nwave-like record, so that every minute vibration would be reproduced. It\r\nshould be remembered that the deepest cut of the recording tool is only\r\nabout one-third the thickness of tissue-paper. Hence, it will be quite\r\napparent that the slightest inequality in the surface of the wax would\r\nbe sufficient to cause false vibration, and thus give rise to distorted\r\neffects in such music or other sounds as were being reproduced. To\r\nremedy this, Edison added an attachment which is called a \"floating\r\nweight,\" and is shown at A in the illustration above.\r\n\r\nThe function of the floating weight is to automatically keep the\r\nstylus in close engagement with the record, thus insuring accuracy of\r\nreproduction. The weight presses the stylus to its work, but because\r\nof its mass it cannot respond to the extremely rapid vibrations of the\r\nstylus. They are therefore communicated to the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nSome of Edison's most remarkable inventions are revealed in a number of\r\ninteresting patents relating to the duplication of phonograph records.\r\nIt would be obviously impossible, from a commercial standpoint, to\r\nobtain a musical record from a high-class artist and sell such an\r\noriginal to the public, as its cost might be from one hundred to several\r\nthousand dollars. Consequently, it is necessary to provide some way by\r\nwhich duplicates may be made cheaply enough to permit their purchase by\r\nthe public at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nThe making of a perfect original musical or other record is a matter\r\nof no small difficulty, as it requires special technical knowledge and\r\nskill gathered from many years of actual experience; but in the exact\r\ncopying, or duplication, of such a record, with its many millions\r\nof microscopic waves and sub-waves, the difficulties are enormously\r\nincreased. The duplicates must be microscopically identical with the\r\noriginal, they must be free from false vibrations or other defects,\r\nalthough both original and duplicates are of such easily defacable\r\nmaterial as wax; and the process must be cheap and commercial not a\r\nscientific laboratory possibility.\r\n\r\nFor making duplicates it was obviously necessary to first secure a mold\r\ncarrying the record in negative or reversed form. From this could be\r\nmolded, or cast, positive copies which would be identical with the\r\noriginal. While the art of electroplating would naturally suggest\r\nitself as the means of making such a mold, an apparently insurmountable\r\nobstacle appeared on the very threshold. Wax, being a non-conductor,\r\ncannot be electroplated unless a conducting surface be first applied.\r\nThe coatings ordinarily used in electro-deposition were entirely out of\r\nthe question on account of coarseness, the deepest waves of the record\r\nbeing less than one-thousandth of an inch in depth, and many of them\r\nprobably ten to one hundred times as shallow. Edison finally decided\r\nto apply a preliminary metallic coating of infinitesimal thinness, and\r\naccomplished this object by a remarkable process known as the vacuous\r\ndeposit. With this he applied to the original record a film of gold\r\nprobably no thicker than one three-hundred-thousandth of an inch, or\r\nseveral hundred times less than the depth of an average wave. Three\r\nhundred such layers placed one on top of the other would make a sheet no\r\nthicker than tissue-paper.\r\n\r\nThe process consists in placing in a vacuum two leaves, or electrodes,\r\nof gold, and between them the original record. A constant discharge of\r\nelectricity of high tension between the electrodes is effected by means\r\nof an induction-coil. The metal is vaporized by this discharge, and is\r\ncarried by it directly toward and deposited upon the original record,\r\nthus forming the minute film of gold above mentioned. The record is\r\nconstantly rotated until its entire surface is coated. A sectional\r\ndiagram of the apparatus (Fig. 6.) will aid to a clearer understanding\r\nof this ingenious process.\r\n\r\nAfter the gold film is formed in the manner described above, a heavy\r\nbacking of baser metal is electroplated upon it, thus forming a\r\nsubstantial mold, from which the original record is extracted by\r\nbreakage or shrinkage.\r\n\r\nDuplicate records in any quantity may now be made from this mold by\r\nsurrounding it with a cold-water jacket and dipping it in a molten\r\nwax-like material. This congeals on the record surface just as melted\r\nbutter would collect on a cold knife, and when the mold is removed the\r\nsurplus wax falls out, leaving a heavy deposit of the material which\r\nforms the duplicate record. Numerous ingenious inventions have been made\r\nby Edison providing for a variety of rapid and economical methods\r\nof duplication, including methods of shrinking a newly made copy to\r\nfacilitate its quick removal from the mold; methods of reaming, of\r\nforming ribs on the interior, and for many other important and essential\r\ndetails, which limits of space will not permit of elaboration. Those\r\nmentioned above are but fair examples of the persistent and effective\r\nwork he has done to bring the phonograph to its present state of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nIn perusing Chapter X of the foregoing narrative, the reader undoubtedly\r\nnoted Edison's clear apprehension of the practical uses of the\r\nphonograph, as evidenced by his prophetic utterances in the article\r\nwritten by him for the North American Review in June, 1878. In view of\r\nthe crudity of the instrument at that time, it must be acknowledged that\r\nEdison's foresight, as vindicated by later events was most remarkable.\r\nNo less remarkable was his intensely practical grasp of mechanical\r\npossibilities of future types of the machine, for we find in one of his\r\nearly English patents (No. 1644 of 1878) the disk form of phonograph\r\nwhich, some ten to fifteen years later, was supposed to be a new\r\ndevelopment in the art. This disk form was also covered by Edison's\r\napplication for a United States patent, filed in 1879. This application\r\nmet with some merely minor technical objections in the Patent Office,\r\nand seems to have passed into the \"abandoned\" class for want of\r\nprosecution, probably because of being overlooked in the tremendous\r\npressure arising from his development of his electric-lighting system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE INCANDESCENT LAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH Edison's contributions to human comfort and progress are\r\nextensive in number and extraordinarily vast and comprehensive in\r\nscope and variety, the universal verdict of the world points to his\r\nincandescent lamp and system of distribution of electrical current as\r\nthe central and crowning achievements of his life up to this time. This\r\nview would seem entirely justifiable when we consider the wonderful\r\nchanges in the conditions of modern life that have been brought about\r\nby the wide-spread employment of these inventions, and the gigantic\r\nindustries that have grown up and been nourished by their world-wide\r\napplication. That he was in this instance a true pioneer and creator\r\nis evident as we consider the subject, for the United States Patent No.\r\n223,898, issued to Edison on January 27, 1880, for an incandescent lamp,\r\nwas of such fundamental character that it opened up an entirely new and\r\ntremendously important art--the art of incandescent electric lighting.\r\nThis statement cannot be successfully controverted, for it has been\r\nabundantly verified after many years of costly litigation. If further\r\nproof were desired, it is only necessary to point to the fact that,\r\nafter thirty years of most strenuous and practical application in the\r\nart by the keenest intellects of the world, every incandescent lamp\r\nthat has ever since been made, including those of modern days, is\r\nstill dependent upon the employment of the essentials disclosed in the\r\nabove-named patent--namely, a filament of high resistance enclosed in\r\na sealed glass globe exhausted of air, with conducting wires passing\r\nthrough the glass.\r\n\r\nAn incandescent lamp is such a simple-appearing article--merely a\r\nfilament sealed into a glass globe--that its intrinsic relation to the\r\nart of electric lighting is far from being apparent at sight. To the lay\r\nmind it would seem that this must have been THE obvious device to make\r\nin order to obtain electric light by incandescence of carbon or\r\nother material. But the reader has already learned from the preceding\r\nnarrative that prior to its invention by Edison such a device was NOT\r\nobvious, even to the most highly trained experts of the world at that\r\nperiod; indeed, it was so far from being obvious that, for some time\r\nafter he had completed practical lamps and was actually lighting them up\r\ntwenty-four hours a day, such a device and such a result were declared\r\nby these same experts to be an utter impossibility. For a short while\r\nthe world outside of Menlo Park held Edison's claims in derision.\r\nHis lamp was pronounced a fake, a myth, possibly a momentary success\r\nmagnified to the dignity of a permanent device by an overenthusiastic\r\ninventor.\r\n\r\nSuch criticism, however, did not disturb Edison. He KNEW that he had\r\nreached the goal. Long ago, by a close process of reasoning, he had\r\nclearly seen that the only road to it was through the path he had\r\ntravelled, and which was now embodied in the philosophy of his\r\nincandescent lamp--namely, a filament, or carbon, of high resistance and\r\nsmall radiating surface, sealed into a glass globe exhausted of air to a\r\nhigh degree of vacuum. In originally committing himself to this line\r\nof investigation he was well aware that he was going in a direction\r\ndiametrically opposite to that followed by previous investigators. Their\r\nefforts had been confined to low-resistance burners of large radiating\r\nsurface for their lamps, but he realized the utter futility of such\r\ndevices. The tremendous problems of heat and the prohibitive quantities\r\nof copper that would be required for conductors for such lamps would be\r\nabsolutely out of the question in commercial practice.\r\n\r\nHe was convinced from the first that the true solution of the\r\nproblem lay in a lamp which should have as its illuminating body\r\na strip of material which would offer such a resistance to\r\nthe flow of electric current that it could be raised to a high\r\ntemperature--incandescence--and be of such small cross-section that it\r\nwould radiate but little heat. At the same time such a lamp must require\r\na relatively small amount of current, in order that comparatively small\r\nconductors could be used, and its burner must be capable of withstanding\r\nthe necessarily high temperatures without disintegration.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that these conceptions were in Edison's mind\r\nat an early period of his investigations, when the best expert opinion\r\nwas that the subdivision of the electric current was an ignis fatuus.\r\nHence we quote the following notes he made, November 15, 1878, in one of\r\nthe laboratory note-books:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A given straight wire having 1 ohm resistance and certain length is\r\nbrought to a given degree of temperature by given battery. If the same\r\nwire be coiled in such a manner that but one-quarter of its surface\r\nradiates, its temperature will be increased four times with the\r\nsame battery, or, one-quarter of this battery will bring it to the\r\ntemperature of straight wire. Or the same given battery will bring\r\na wire whose total resistance is 4 ohms to the same temperature as\r\nstraight wire.\r\n\r\n\"This was actually determined by trial.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of heat lost by a body is in proportion to the radiating\r\nsurface of that body. If one square inch of platina be heated to 100\r\ndegrees it will fall to, say, zero in one second, whereas, if it was at\r\n200 degrees it would require two seconds.\r\n\r\n\"Hence, in the case of incandescent conductors, if the radiating surface\r\nbe twelve inches and the temperature on each inch be 100, or 1200 for\r\nall, if it is so coiled or arranged that there is but one-quarter, or\r\nthree inches, of radiating surface, then the temperature on each inch\r\nwill be 400. If reduced to three-quarters of an inch it will have on\r\nthat three-quarters of an inch 1600 degrees Fahr., notwithstanding\r\nthe original total amount was but 1200, because the radiation has\r\nbeen reduced to three-quarters, or 75 units; hence, the effect of the\r\nlessening of the radiation is to raise the temperature of each remaining\r\ninch not radiating to 125 degrees. If the radiating surface should be\r\nreduced to three-thirty-seconds of an inch, the temperature would reach\r\n6400 degrees Fahr. To carry out this law to the best advantage in regard\r\nto platina, etc., then with a given length of wire to quadruple the heat\r\nwe must lessen the radiating surface to one-quarter, and to do this in a\r\nspiral, three-quarters must be within the spiral and one-quarter outside\r\nfor radiating; hence, a square wire or other means, such as a spiral\r\nwithin a spiral, must be used. These results account for the enormous\r\ntemperature of the Electric Arc with one horse-power; as, for instance,\r\nif one horse-power will heat twelve inches of wire to 1000 degrees\r\nFahr., and this is concentrated to have one-quarter of the radiating\r\nsurface, it would reach a temperature of 4000 degrees or sufficient\r\nto melt it; but, supposing it infusible, the further concentration to\r\none-eighth its surface, it would reach a temperature of 16,000 degrees,\r\nand to one-thirty-second its surface, which would be about the radiating\r\nsurface of the Electric Arc, it would reach 64,000 degrees Fahr. Of\r\ncourse, when Light is radiated in great quantities not quite these\r\ntemperatures would be reached.\r\n\r\n\"Another curious law is this: It will require a greater initial battery\r\nto bring an iron wire of the same size and resistance to a given\r\ntemperature than it will a platina wire in proportion to their specific\r\nheats, and in the case of Carbon, a piece of Carbon three inches long\r\nand one-eighth diameter, with a resistance of 1 ohm, will require a\r\ngreater battery power to bring it to a given temperature than a cylinder\r\nof thin platina foil of the same length, diameter, and resistance,\r\nbecause the specific heat of Carbon is many times greater; besides, if\r\nI am not mistaken, the radiation of a roughened body for heat is greater\r\nthan a polished one like platina.\"\r\n\r\nProceeding logically upon these lines of thought and following them\r\nout through many ramifications, we have seen how he at length made a\r\nfilament of carbon of high resistance and small radiating surface, and\r\nthrough a concurrent investigation of the phenomena of high vacua and\r\noccluded gases was able to produce a true incandescent lamp. Not only\r\nwas it a lamp as a mere article--a device to give light--but it was also\r\nan integral part of his great and complete system of lighting, to every\r\npart of which it bore a fixed and definite ratio, and in relation to\r\nwhich it was the keystone that held the structure firmly in place.\r\n\r\nThe work of Edison on incandescent lamps did not stop at this\r\nfundamental invention, but extended through more than eighteen years\r\nof a most intense portion of his busy life. During that period he was\r\ngranted one hundred and forty-nine other patents on the lamp and its\r\nmanufacture. Although very many of these inventions were of the utmost\r\nimportance and value, we cannot attempt to offer a detailed exposition\r\nof them in this necessarily brief article, but must refer the reader,\r\nif interested, to the patents themselves, a full list being given at\r\nthe end of this Appendix. The outline sketch will indicate the principal\r\npatents covering the basic features of the lamp.\r\n\r\nThe litigation on the Edison lamp patents was one of the most determined\r\nand stubbornly fought contests in the history of modern jurisprudence.\r\nVast interests were at stake. All of the technical, expert, and\r\nprofessional skill and knowledge that money could procure or experience\r\ndevise were availed of in the bitter fights that raged in the courts for\r\nmany years. And although the Edison interests had spent from first to\r\nlast nearly $2,000,000, and had only about three years left in the\r\nlife of the fundamental patent, Edison was thoroughly sustained as to\r\npriority by the decisions in the various suits. We shall offer a few\r\nbrief extracts from some of these decisions.\r\n\r\nIn a suit against the United States Electric Lighting Company, United\r\nStates Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York, July 14,\r\n1891, Judge Wallace said, in his opinion: \"The futility of hoping to\r\nmaintain a burner in vacuo with any permanency had discouraged prior\r\ninventors, and Mr. Edison is entitled to the credit of obviating the\r\nmechanical difficulties which disheartened them.... He was the first\r\nto make a carbon of materials, and by a process which was especially\r\ndesigned to impart high specific resistance to it; the first to make a\r\ncarbon in the special form for the special purpose of imparting to it\r\nhigh total resistance; and the first to combine such a burner with the\r\nnecessary adjuncts of lamp construction to prevent its disintegration\r\nand give it sufficiently long life. By doing these things he made a lamp\r\nwhich was practically operative and successful, the embryo of the best\r\nlamps now in commercial use, and but for which the subdivision of the\r\nelectric light by incandescence would still be nothing but the ignis\r\nfatuus which it was proclaimed to be in 1879 by some of the reamed\r\nexperts who are now witnesses to belittle his achievement and show that\r\nit did not rise to the dignity of an invention.... It is impossible to\r\nresist the conclusion that the invention of the slender thread of carbon\r\nas a substitute for the burners previously employed opened the path to\r\nthe practical subdivision of the electric light.\"\r\n\r\nAn appeal was taken in the above suit to the United States Circuit Court\r\nof Appeals, and on October 4, 1892, the decree of the lower court was\r\naffirmed. The judges (Lacombe and Shipman), in a long opinion reviewed\r\nthe facts and the art, and said, inter alia: \"Edison's invention was\r\npractically made when he ascertained the theretofore unknown fact that\r\ncarbon would stand high temperature, even when very attenuated, if\r\noperated in a high vacuum, without the phenomenon of disintegration.\r\nThis fact he utilized by the means which he has described, a lamp having\r\na filamentary carbon burner in a nearly perfect vacuum.\"\r\n\r\nIn a suit against the Boston Incandescent Lamp Company et al., in the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts, decided\r\nin favor of Edison on June 11, 1894, Judge Colt, in his opinion, said,\r\namong other things: \"Edison made an important invention; he produced the\r\nfirst practical incandescent electric lamp; the patent is a pioneer in\r\nthe sense of the patent law; it may be said that his invention created\r\nthe art of incandescent electric lighting.\"\r\n\r\nOpinions of other courts, similar in tenor to the foregoing, might be\r\ncited, but it would be merely in the nature of reiteration. The above\r\nare sufficient to illustrate the direct clearness of judicial decision\r\non Edison's position as the founder of the art of electric lighting by\r\nincandescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. EDISON'S DYNAMO WORK\r\n\r\nAT the present writing, when, after the phenomenally rapid electrical\r\ndevelopment of thirty years, we find on the market a great variety of\r\nmodern forms of efficient current generators advertised under the names\r\nof different inventors (none, however, bearing the name of Edison), a\r\nyoung electrical engineer of the present generation might well inquire\r\nwhether the great inventor had ever contributed anything to the art\r\nbeyond a mere TYPE of machine formerly made and bearing his name, but\r\nnot now marketed except second hand.\r\n\r\nFor adequate information he might search in vain the books usually\r\nregarded as authorities on the subject of dynamo-electric machinery,\r\nfor with slight exceptions there has been a singular unanimity in\r\nthe omission of writers to give Edison credit for his great and basic\r\ncontributions to heavy-current technics, although they have been\r\nuniversally acknowledged by scientific and practical men to have laid\r\nthe foundation for the efficiency of, and to be embodied in all modern\r\ngenerators of current.\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be expected that the essential facts of Edison's\r\nwork would appear on the face of his numerous patents on dynamo-electric\r\nmachinery, but such is not necessarily the case, unless they are\r\ncarefully studied in the light of the state of the art as it existed\r\nat the time. While some of these patents (especially the earlier ones)\r\ncover specific devices embodying fundamental principles that not only\r\nsurvive to the present day, but actually lie at the foundation of\r\nthe art as it now exists, there is no revelation therein of Edison's\r\npreceding studies of magnets, which extended over many years, nor of his\r\nlater systematic investigations and deductions.\r\n\r\nDynamo-electric machines of a primitive kind had been invented and were\r\nin use to a very limited extent for arc lighting and electroplating for\r\nsome years prior to the summer of 1819, when Edison, with an embryonic\r\nlighting SYSTEM in mind, cast about for a type of machine technically\r\nand commercially suitable for the successful carrying out of his plans.\r\nHe found absolutely none. On the contrary, all of the few types then\r\nobtainable were uneconomical, indeed wasteful, in regard to efficiency.\r\nThe art, if indeed there can be said to have been an art at that time,\r\nwas in chaotic confusion, and only because of Edison's many years' study\r\nof the magnet was he enabled to conclude that insufficiency in quantity\r\nof iron in the magnets of such machines, together with poor surface\r\ncontacts, rendered the cost of magnetization abnormally high. The\r\nheating of solid armatures, the only kind then known, and poor\r\ninsulation in the commutators, also gave rise to serious losses. But\r\nperhaps the most serious drawback lay in the high-resistance armature,\r\nbased upon the highest scientific dictum of the time that in order\r\nto obtain the maximum amount of work from a machine, the internal\r\nresistance of the armature must equal the resistance of the exterior\r\ncircuit, although the application of this principle entailed the useless\r\nexpenditure of at least 50 per cent. of the applied energy.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost incredible that only a little over thirty years ago the\r\nsum of scientific knowledge in regard to dynamo-electric machines was so\r\nmeagre that the experts of the period should settle upon such a dictum\r\nas this, but such was the fact, as will presently appear. Mechanical\r\ngenerators of electricity were comparatively new at that time; their\r\ntheory and practice were very imperfectly understood; indeed, it is\r\nquite within the bounds of truth to say that the correct principles were\r\nbefogged by reason of the lack of practical knowledge of their actual\r\nuse. Electricians and scientists of the period had been accustomed for\r\nmany years past to look to the chemical battery as the source from which\r\nto obtain electrical energy; and in the practical application of such\r\nenergy to telegraphy and kindred uses, much thought and ingenuity had\r\nbeen expended in studying combinations of connecting such cells so as to\r\nget the best results. In the text-books of the period it was stated as a\r\nsettled principle that, in order to obtain the maximum work out of a\r\nset of batteries, the internal resistance must approximately equal the\r\nresistance of the exterior circuit. This principle and its application\r\nin practice were quite correct as regards chemical batteries, but not as\r\nregards dynamo machines. Both were generators of electrical current, but\r\nso different in construction and operation, that rules applicable to the\r\npractical use of the one did not apply with proper commercial efficiency\r\nto the other. At the period under consideration, which may be said to\r\nhave been just before dawn of the day of electric light, the philosophy\r\nof the dynamo was seen only in mysterious, hazy outlines--just emerging\r\nfrom the darkness of departing night. Perhaps it is not surprising,\r\nthen, that the dynamo was loosely regarded by electricians as\r\nthe practical equivalent of a chemical battery; that many of the\r\ncharacteristics of performance of the chemical cell were also attributed\r\nto it, and that if the maximum work could be gotten out of a set of\r\nbatteries when the internal and external resistances were equal (and\r\nthis was commercially the best thing to do), so must it be also with a\r\ndynamo.\r\n\r\nIt was by no miracle that Edison was far and away ahead of his time\r\nwhen he undertook to improve the dynamo. He was possessed of absolute\r\nKNOWLEDGE far beyond that of his contemporaries. This he ad acquired by\r\nthe hardest kind of work and incessant experiment with magnets of all\r\nkinds during several years preceding, particularly in connection\r\nwith his study of automatic telegraphy. His knowledge of magnets was\r\ntremendous. He had studied and experimented with electromagnets in\r\nenormous variety, and knew their peculiarities in charge and discharge,\r\nlag, self-induction, static effects, condenser effects, and the various\r\nother phenomena connected therewith. He had also made collateral studies\r\nof iron, steel, and copper, insulation, winding, etc. Hence, by reason\r\nof this extensive work and knowledge, Edison was naturally in a position\r\nto realize the utter commercial impossibility of the then best dynamo\r\nmachine in existence, which had an efficiency of only about 40 per\r\ncent., and was constructed on the \"cut-and-try\" principle.\r\n\r\nHe was also naturally in a position to assume the task he set out to\r\naccomplish, of undertaking to plan and-build an improved type of machine\r\nthat should be commercial in having an efficiency of at least 90 per\r\ncent. Truly a prodigious undertaking in those dark days, when from the\r\nstandpoint of Edison's large experience the most practical and correct\r\nelectrical treatise was contained in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and\r\nin a German publication which Mr. Upton had brought with him after he\r\nhad finished his studies with the illustrious Helmholtz. It was at this\r\nperiod that Mr. Upton commenced his association with Edison, bringing\r\nto the great work the very latest scientific views and the assistance\r\nof the higher mathematics, to which he had devoted his attention for\r\nseveral years previously.\r\n\r\nAs some account of Edison's investigations in this connection has\r\nalready been given in Chapter XII of the narrative, we shall not enlarge\r\nupon them here, but quote from An Historical Review, by Charles L.\r\nClarke, Laboratory Assistant at Menlo Park, 1880-81; Chief Engineer of\r\nthe Edison Electric Light Company, 1881-84:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In June, 1879, was published the account of the Edison dynamo-electric\r\nmachine that survived in the art. This machine went into extensive\r\ncommercial use, and was notable for its very massive and powerful\r\nfield-magnets and armature of extremely low resistance as compared with\r\nthe combined external resistance of the supply-mains and lamps. By means\r\nof the large masses of iron in the field-magnets, and closely fitted\r\njoints between the several parts thereof, the magnetic resistance\r\n(reluctance) of the iron parts of the magnetic circuit was reduced to\r\na minimum, and the required magnetization effected with the maximum\r\neconomy. At the same time Mr. Edison announced the commercial necessity\r\nof having the armature of the dynamo of low resistance, as compared\r\nwith the external resistance, in order that a large percentage of the\r\nelectrical energy developed should be utilized in the lamps, and only a\r\nsmall percentage lost in the armature, albeit this procedure reduced the\r\ntotal generating capacity of the machine. He also proposed to make the\r\nresistance of the supply-mains small, as compared with the combined\r\nresistance of the lamps in multiple arc, in order to still further\r\nincrease the percentage of energy utilized in the lamps. And likewise to\r\nthis end the combined resistance of the generator armatures in multiple\r\narc was kept relatively small by adjusting the number of generators\r\noperating in multiple at any time to the number of lamps then in use.\r\nThe field-magnet circuits of the dynamos were connected in multiple with\r\na separate energizing source; and the field-current; and strength of\r\nfield, were regulated to maintain the required amount of electromotive\r\nforce upon the supply-mains under all conditions of load from the\r\nmaximum to the minimum number of lamps in use, and to keep the\r\nelectromotive force of all machines alike.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest of Edison's dynamo experiments were those relating to\r\nthe core of the armature. He realized at once that the heat generated in\r\na solid core was a prolific source of loss. He experimented with\r\nbundles of iron wires variously insulated, also with sheet-iron rolled\r\ncylindrically and covered with iron wire wound concentrically. These\r\nexperiments and many others were tried in a great variety of ways,\r\nuntil, as the result of all this work, Edison arrived at the principle\r\nwhich has remained in the art to this day. He split up the iron core of\r\nthe armature into thin laminations, separated by paper, thus practically\r\nsuppressing Foucault currents therein and resulting heating effect.\r\nIt was in his machine also that mica was used for the first time as an\r\ninsulating medium in a commutator. [27]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 27: The commercial manufacture of built-up sheets\r\n     of mica for electrical purposes was first established at the\r\n     Edison Machine Works, Goerck Street, New York, in 1881.]\r\n\r\nElementary as these principles will appear to the modern student or\r\nengineer, they were denounced as nothing short of absurdity at the time\r\nof their promulgation--especially so with regard to Edison's proposal\r\nto upset the then settled dictum that the armature resistance should\r\nbe equal to the external resistance. His proposition was derided in\r\nthe technical press of the period, both at home and abroad. As public\r\nopinion can be best illustrated by actual quotation, we shall present a\r\ncharacteristic instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Scientific American of October 18, 1879, there appeared an\r\nillustrated article by Mr. Upton on Edison's dynamo machine, in which\r\nEdison's views and claims were set forth. A subsequent issue contained a\r\nsomewhat acrimonious letter of criticism by a well-known maker of dynamo\r\nmachines. At the risk of being lengthy, we must quote nearly all this\r\nletter: \"I can scarcely conceive it as possible that the article on the\r\nabove subject '(Edison's Electric Generator)' in last week's Scientific\r\nAmerican could have been written from statements derived from Mr. Edison\r\nhimself, inasmuch as so many of the advantages claimed for the machine\r\ndescribed and statements of the results obtained are so manifestly\r\nabsurd as to indicate on the part of both writer and prompter a positive\r\nwant of knowledge of the electric circuit and the principles governing\r\nthe construction and operation of electric machines.\r\n\r\n\"It is not my intention to criticise the design or construction of the\r\nmachine (not because they are not open to criticism), as I am now\r\nand have been for many years engaged in the manufacture of electric\r\nmachines, but rather to call attention to the impossibility of\r\nobtaining the described results without destroying the doctrine of the\r\nconservation and correlation of forces.\r\n\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\n\"It is stated that 'the internal resistance of the armature' of this\r\nmachine 'is only 1/2 ohm.' On this fact and the disproportion between\r\nthis resistance and that of the external circuit, the theory of the\r\nalleged efficiency of the machine is stated to be based, for we are\r\ninformed that, 'while this generator in general principle is the same\r\nas in the best well-known forms, still there is an all-important\r\ndifference, which is that it will convert and deliver for useful work\r\nnearly double the number of foot-pounds that any other machine will\r\nunder like conditions.'\" The writer of this critical letter then\r\nproceeds to quote Mr. Upton's statement of this efficiency: \"'Now the\r\nenergy converted is distributed over the whole resistance, hence if the\r\nresistance of the machine be represented by 1 and the exterior circuit\r\nby 9, then of the total energy converted nine-tenths will be useful, as\r\nit is outside of the machine, and one-tenth is lost in the resistance of\r\nthe machine.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter this the critic goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\"How any one acquainted with the laws of the electric circuit can make\r\nsuch statements is what I cannot understand. The statement last quoted\r\nis mathematically absurd. It implies either that the machine is\r\nCAPABLE OF INCREASING ITS OWN ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE NINE TIMES WITHOUT\r\nAN INCREASED EXPENDITURE OF POWER, or that external resistance is NOT\r\nresistance to the current induced in the Edison machine.\r\n\r\n\"Does Mr. Edison, or any one for him, mean to say that r/n enables him\r\nto obtain nE, and that C IS NOT = E / (r/n + R)? If so Mr. Edison has\r\ndiscovered something MORE than perpetual motion, and Mr. Keely had\r\nbetter retire from the field.\r\n\r\n\"Further on the writer (Mr. Upton) gives us another example of this mode\r\nof reasoning when, emboldened and satisfied with the absurd theory above\r\nexposed, he endeavors to prove the cause of the inefficiency of the\r\nSiemens and other machines. Couldn't the writer of the article see that\r\nsince C = E/(r + R) that by R/n or by making R = r, the machine would,\r\naccording to his theory, have returned more useful current to the\r\ncircuit than could be due to the power employed (and in the ratio\r\nindicated), so that there would actually be a creation of force! . . . .\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion allow me to say that if Mr Edison thinks he has\r\naccomplished so much by the REDUCTION OF THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE of\r\nhis machine, that he has much more to do in this direction before his\r\nmachine will equal IN THIS RESPECT others already in the market.\"\r\n\r\nAnother participant in the controversy on Edison's generator was a\r\nscientific gentleman, who in a long article published in the Scientific\r\nAmerican, in November, 1879, gravely undertook to instruct Edison in\r\nthe A B C of electrical principles, and then proceeded to demonstrate\r\nmathematically the IMPOSSIBILITY of doing WHAT EDISON HAD ACTUALLY DONE.\r\nThis critic concludes with a gentle rebuke to the inventor for ill-timed\r\njesting, and a suggestion to furnish AUTHENTIC information!\r\n\r\nIn the light of facts, as they were and are, this article is so full of\r\nhumor that we shall indulge in a few quotations It commences in A B\r\nC fashion as follows: \"Electric machines convert mechanical into\r\nelectrical energy.... The ratio of yield to consumption is the\r\nexpression of the efficiency of the machine.... How many foot-pounds\r\nof electricity can be got out of 100 foot-pounds of mechanical energy?\r\nCertainly not more than 100: certainly less.... The facts and laws\r\nof physics, with the assistance of mathematical logic, never fail to\r\nfurnish precious answers to such questions.\"\r\n\r\nThe would-be critic then goes on to tabulate tests of certain other\r\ndynamo machines by a committee of the Franklin Institute in 1879, the\r\nresults of which showed that these machines returned about 50 per cent.\r\nof the applied mechanical energy, ingenuously remarking: \"Why is it that\r\nwhen we have produced the electricity, half of it must slip away? Some\r\npersons will be content if they are told simply that it is a way which\r\nelectricity has of behaving. But there is a satisfactory rational\r\nexplanation which I believe can be made plain to persons of ordinary\r\nintelligence. It ought to be known to all those who are making or using\r\nmachines. I am grieved to observe that many persons who talk and write\r\nglibly about electricity do not understand it; some even ignore or deny\r\nthe fact to be explained.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows HIS explanation, after which he goes on to say: \"At this\r\npoint plausibly comes in a suggestion that the internal part of the\r\ncircuit be made very small and the external part very large. Why\r\nnot (say) make the internal part 1 and the external 9, thus saving\r\nnine-tenths and losing only one-tenth? Unfortunately, the suggestion is\r\nnot practical; a fallacy is concealed in it.\"\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to prove his case mathematically, to his own\r\nsatisfaction, following it sadly by condoling with and a warning to\r\nEdison: \"But about Edison's electric generator! . . . No one capable of\r\nmaking the improvements in the telegraph and telephone, for which we are\r\nindebted to Mr. Edison, could be other than an accomplished electrician.\r\nHis reputation as a scientist, indeed, is smirched by the newspaper\r\nexaggerations, and no doubt he will be more careful in future. But there\r\nis a danger nearer home, indeed, among his own friends and in his very\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n\". . . The writer of page 242\" (the original article) \"is probably a\r\nfriend of Mr. Edison, but possibly, alas! a wicked partner. Why does\r\nhe say such things as these? 'Mr. Edison claims that he realizes 90\r\nper cent. of the power applied to this machine in external work.' . . .\r\nPerhaps the writer is a humorist, and had in his mind Colonel Sellers,\r\netc., which he could not keep out of a serious discussion; but such\r\njests are not good.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Edison has built a very interesting machine, and he has the\r\nopportunity of making a valuable contribution to the electrical arts by\r\nfurnishing authentic accounts of its capabilities.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing extracts are unavoidably lengthy, but, viewed in the light\r\nof facts, serve to illustrate most clearly that Edison's conceptions and\r\nwork were far and away ahead of the comprehension of his contemporaries\r\nin the art, and that his achievements in the line of efficient dynamo\r\ndesign and construction were indeed truly fundamental and revolutionary\r\nin character. Much more of similar nature to the above could be quoted\r\nfrom other articles published elsewhere, but the foregoing will serve as\r\ninstances generally representing all. In the controversy which\r\nappeared in the columns of the Scientific American, Mr. Upton, Edison's\r\nmathematician, took up the question on his side, and answered the\r\ncritics by further elucidations of the principles on which Edison had\r\nfounded such remarkable and radical improvements in the art. The type\r\nof Edison's first dynamo-electric machine, the description of which gave\r\nrise to the above controversy, is shown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nAny account of Edison's work on the dynamo would be incomplete did\r\nit omit to relate his conception and construction of the great\r\ndirect-connected steam-driven generator that was the prototype of the\r\ncolossal units which are used throughout the world to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the demonstrating plant installed and operated by him at Menlo\r\nPark in 1880 ten dynamos of eight horse-power each were driven by a\r\nslow-speed engine through a complicated system of counter-shafting,\r\nand, to quote from Mr. Clarke's Historical Review, \"it was found that\r\na considerable percentage of the power of the engine was necessarily\r\nwasted in friction by this method of driving, and to prevent this waste\r\nand thus increase the economy of his system, Mr. Edison conceived\r\nthe idea of substituting a single large dynamo for the several small\r\ndynamos, and directly coupling it with the driving engine, and at the\r\nsame time preserve the requisite high armature speed by using an engine\r\nof the high-speed type. He also expected to realize still further gains\r\nin economy from the use of a large dynamo in place of several small\r\nmachines by a more than correspondingly lower armature resistance, less\r\nenergy for magnetizing the field, and for other minor reasons. To the\r\nsame end, he intended to supply steam to the engine under a much higher\r\nboiler pressure than was customary in stationary-engine driving at that\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThe construction of the first one of these large machines was commenced\r\nlate in the year 1880. Early in 1881 it was completed and tested, but\r\nsome radical defects in armature construction were developed, and it was\r\nalso demonstrated that a rate of engine speed too high for continuously\r\nsafe and economical operation had been chosen. The machine was laid\r\naside. An accurate illustration of this machine, as it stood in the\r\nengine-room at Menlo Park, is given in Van Nostrand's Engineering\r\nMagazine, Vol. XXV, opposite page 439, and a brief description is given\r\non page 450.\r\n\r\nWith the experience thus gained, Edison began, in the spring of 1881, at\r\nthe Edison Machine Works, Goerck Street, New York City, the construction\r\nof the first successful machine of this type. This was the great machine\r\nknown as \"Jumbo No. 1,\" which is referred to in the narrative as having\r\nbeen exhibited at the Paris International Electrical Exposition, where\r\nit was regarded as the wonder of the electrical world. An intimation of\r\nsome of the tremendous difficulties encountered in the construction of\r\nthis machine has already been given in preceding pages, hence we shall\r\nnot now enlarge on the subject, except to note in passing that the\r\nterribly destructive effects of the spark of self-induction and the\r\narcing following it were first manifested in this powerful machine, but\r\nwere finally overcome by Edison after a strenuous application of his\r\npowers to the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest, however, to mention some of its dimensions\r\nand electrical characteristics, quoting again from Mr. Clarke: \"The\r\nfield-magnet had eight solid cylindrical cores, 8 inches in diameter\r\nand 57 inches long, upon each of which was wound an exciting-coil of 3.2\r\nohms resistance, consisting of 2184 turns of No. 10 B. W. G. insulated\r\ncopper wire, disposed in six layers. The laminated iron core of the\r\narmature, formed of thin iron disks, was 33 3/4 inches long, and had an\r\ninternal diameter of 12 1/2 inches, and an external diameter of 26 7/16\r\ninches. It was mounted on a 6-inch shaft. The field-poles were 33 3/4\r\ninches long, and 27 1/2 inches inside diameter The armature winding\r\nconsisted of 146 copper bars on the face of the core, connected into a\r\nclosed-coil winding by means of 73 copper disks at each end of the core.\r\nThe cross-sectional area of each bar was 0.2 square inch their average\r\nlength was 42.7 inches, and the copper end-disks were 0.065 inch thick.\r\nThe commutator had 73 sections. The armature resistance was 0.0092\r\nohm, [28] of which 0.0055 ohm was in the armature bars and 0.0037 ohm in\r\nthe end-disks.\" An illustration of the next latest type of this machine\r\nis presented in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 28: Had Edison in Upton's Scientific American\r\n     article in 1879 proposed such an exceedingly low armature\r\n     resistance for this immense generator (although its ratio\r\n     was proportionate to the original machine), his critics\r\n     might probably have been sufficiently indignant as to be\r\n     unable to express themselves coherently.]\r\n\r\nThe student may find it interesting to look up Edison's United States\r\nPatents Nos. 242,898, 263,133, 263,146, and 246,647, bearing upon the\r\nconstruction of the \"Jumbo\"; also illustrated articles in the technical\r\njournals of the time, among which may be mentioned: Scientific American,\r\nVol. XLV, page 367; Engineering, London, Vol. XXXII, pages 409 and 419,\r\nThe Telegraphic Journal and Electrical Review, London, Vol. IX, pages\r\n431-433, 436-446; La Nature, Paris, 9th year, Part II, pages 408-409;\r\nZeitschrift fur Angewandte Elektricitaatslehre, Munich and Leipsic, Vol.\r\nIV, pages 4-14; and Dredge's Electric Illumination, 1882, Vol. I, page\r\n261.\r\n\r\nThe further development of these great machines later on, and their\r\nextensive practical use, are well known and need no further comment,\r\nexcept in passing it may be noted that subsequent machines had each\r\na capacity of 1200 lamps of 16 candle-power, and that the armature\r\nresistance was still further reduced to 0.0039 ohm.\r\n\r\nEdison's clear insight into the future, as illustrated by his persistent\r\nadvocacy of large direct-connected generating units, is abundantly\r\nvindicated by present-day practice. His Jumbo machines, of 175\r\nhorse-power, so enormous for their time, have served as prototypes, and\r\nhave been succeeded by generators which have constantly grown in size\r\nand capacity until at this time (1910) it is not uncommon to employ\r\nsuch generating units of a capacity of 14,000 kilowatts, or about 18,666\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\nWe have not entered into specific descriptions of the many other forms\r\nof dynamo machines invented by Edison, such as the multipolar, the\r\ndisk dynamo, and the armature with two windings, for sub-station\r\ndistribution; indeed, it is not possible within our limited space to\r\npresent even a brief digest of Edison's great and comprehensive work on\r\nthe dynamo-electric machine, as embodied in his extensive experiments\r\nand in over one hundred patents granted to him. We have, therefore,\r\nconfined ourselves to the indication of a few salient and basic\r\nfeatures, leaving it to the interested student to examine the patents\r\nand the technical literature of the long period of time over which\r\nEdison's labors were extended.\r\n\r\nAlthough he has not given any attention to the subject of generators for\r\nmany years, an interesting instance of his incisive method of overcoming\r\nminor difficulties occurred while the present volumes were under\r\npreparation (1909). Carbon for commutator brushes has been superseded\r\nby graphite in some cases, the latter material being found much more\r\nadvantageous, electrically. Trouble developed, however, for the reason\r\nthat while carbon was hard and would wear away the mica insulation\r\nsimultaneously with the copper, graphite, being softer, would wear\r\naway only the copper, leaving ridges of mica and thus causing sparking\r\nthrough unequal contact. At this point Edison was asked to diagnose the\r\ntrouble and provide a remedy. He suggested the cutting out of the mica\r\npieces almost to the bottom, leaving the commutator bars separated by\r\nair-spaces. This scheme was objected to on the ground that particles\r\nof graphite would fill these air-spaces and cause a short-circuit. His\r\nanswer was that the air-spaces constituted the value of his plan, as\r\nthe particles of graphite falling into them would be thrown out by the\r\naction of centrifugal force as the commutator revolved. And thus it\r\noccurred as a matter of fact, and the trouble was remedied. This idea\r\nwas subsequently adopted by a great manufacturer of generators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THE EDISON FEEDER SYSTEM\r\n\r\nTO quote from the preamble of the specifications of United States\r\nPatent No. 264,642, issued to Thomas A. Edison September 19, 1882: \"This\r\ninvention relates to a method of equalizing the tension or 'pressure'\r\nof the current through an entire system of electric lighting or other\r\ntranslation of electric force, preventing what is ordinarily known as a\r\n'drop' in those portions of the system the more remote from the central\r\nstation....\"\r\n\r\nThe problem which was solved by the Edison feeder system was that\r\nrelating to the equal distribution of current on a large scale over\r\nextended areas, in order that a constant and uniform electrical pressure\r\ncould be maintained in every part of the distribution area without\r\nprohibitory expenditure for copper for mains and conductors.\r\n\r\nThis problem had a twofold aspect, although each side was inseparably\r\nbound up in the other. On the one hand it was obviously necessary in a\r\nlighting system that each lamp should be of standard candle-power, and\r\ncapable of interchangeable use on any part of the system, giving the\r\nsame degree of illumination at every point, whether near to or remote\r\nfrom the source of electrical energy. On the other hand, this must be\r\naccomplished by means of a system of conductors so devised and arranged\r\nthat while they would insure the equal pressure thus demanded, their\r\nmass and consequent cost would not exceed the bounds of practical and\r\ncommercially economical investment.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of this invention can be better understood and\r\nappreciated by a brief glance at the state of the art in 1878-79,\r\nwhen Edison was conducting the final series of investigations which\r\nculminated in his invention of the incandescent lamp and SYSTEM of\r\nlighting. At this time, and for some years previously, the scientific\r\nworld had been working on the \"subdivision of the electric light,\" as\r\nit was then termed. Some leading authorities pronounced it absolutely\r\nimpossible of achievement on any extended scale, while a very few\r\nothers, of more optimistic mind, could see no gleam of light through the\r\ndarkness, but confidently hoped for future developments by such workers\r\nas Edison.\r\n\r\nThe earlier investigators, including those up to the period above named,\r\nthought of the problem as involving the subdivision of a FIXED UNIT\r\nof current, which, being sufficient to cause illumination by one large\r\nlamp, might be divided into a number of small units whose aggregate\r\nlight would equal the candle-power of this large lamp. It was found,\r\nhowever, in their experiments that the contrary effect was produced,\r\nfor with every additional lamp introduced in the circuit the total\r\ncandle-power decreased instead of increasing. If they were placed in\r\nseries the light varied inversely as the SQUARE of the number of lamps\r\nin circuit; while if they were inserted in multiple arc, the light\r\ndiminished as the CUBE of the number in circuit. [29] The idea of\r\nmaintaining a constant potential and of PROPORTIONING THE CURRENT to\r\nthe number of lamps in circuit did not occur to most of these\r\nearly investigators as a feasible method of overcoming the supposed\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 29: M. Fontaine, in his book on Electric Lighting\r\n     (1877), showed that with the current of a battery composed\r\n     of sixteen elements, one lamp gave an illumination equal to\r\n     54 burners; whereas two similar lamps, if introduced in\r\n     parallel or multiple arc, gave the light of only 6 1/2\r\n     burners in all; three lamps of only 2 burners in all; four\r\n     lamps of only 3/4 of one burner, and five lamps of 1/4 of a\r\n     burner.]\r\n\r\nIt would also seem that although the general method of placing\r\nexperimental lamps in multiple arc was known at this period, the idea\r\nof \"drop\" of electrical pressure was imperfectly understood, if, indeed,\r\nrealized at all, as a most important item to be considered in attempting\r\nthe solution of the problem. As a matter of fact, the investigators\r\npreceding Edison do not seem to have conceived the idea of a \"system\" at\r\nall; hence it is not surprising to find them far astray from the correct\r\ntheory of subdivision of the electric current. It may easily be\r\nbelieved that the term \"subdivision\" was a misleading one to these early\r\nexperimenters. For a very short time Edison also was thus misled, but\r\nas soon as he perceived that the problem was one involving the\r\nMULTIPLICATION OF CURRENT UNITS, his broad conception of a \"system\" was\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, all conductors of electricity offer more or less\r\nresistance to the passage of current through them and in the technical\r\nterminology of electrical science the word \"drop\" (when used in\r\nreference to a system of distribution) is used to indicate a fall or\r\nloss of initial electrical pressure arising from the resistance offered\r\nby the copper conductors leading from the source of energy to the lamps.\r\nThe result of this resistance is to convert or translate a portion of\r\nthe electrical energy into another form--namely, heat, which in the\r\nconductors is USELESS and wasteful and to some extent inevitable in\r\npractice, but is to be avoided and remedied as far as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in an electric-lighting system there is also a fall or\r\nloss of electrical pressure which occurs in overcoming the much greater\r\nresistance of the filament in an incandescent lamp. In this case there\r\nis also a translation of the energy, but here it accomplishes a USEFUL\r\npurpose, as the energy is converted into the form of light through the\r\nincandescence of the filament. Such a conversion is called \"work\"\r\nas distinguished from \"drop,\" although a fall of initial electrical\r\npressure is involved in each case.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of \"drop\" varies according to the quantity of copper\r\nused in conductors, both as to cross-section and length. The smaller the\r\ncross-sectional area, the greater the percentage of drop. The practical\r\neffect of this drop would be a loss of illumination in the lamps as we\r\ngo farther away from the source of energy. This may be illustrated by\r\na simple diagram in which G is a generator, or source of energy,\r\nfurnishing current at a potential or electrical pressure of 110 volts;\r\n1 and 2 are main conductors, from which 110-volt lamps, L, are taken in\r\nderived circuits. It will be understood that the circuits represented in\r\nFig. 1 are theoretically supposed to extend over a large area. The main\r\nconductors are sufficiently large in cross-section to offer but little\r\nresistance in those parts which are comparatively near the generator,\r\nbut as the current traverses their extended length there is a gradual\r\nincrease of resistance to overcome, and consequently the drop increases,\r\nas shown by the figures. The result of the drop in such a case would\r\nbe that while the two lamps, or groups, nearest the generator would be\r\nburning at their proper degree of illumination, those beyond would give\r\nlower and lower candle-power, successively, until the last lamp, or\r\ngroup, would be giving only about two-thirds the light of the first two.\r\nIn other words, a very slight drop in voltage means a disproportionately\r\ngreat loss in illumination. Hence, by using a primitive system of\r\ndistribution, such as that shown by Fig. 1, the initial voltage would\r\nhave to be so high, in order to obtain the proper candle-power at\r\nthe end of the circuit, that the lamps nearest the generator would be\r\ndangerously overheated. It might be suggested as a solution of this\r\nproblem that lamps of different voltages could be used. But, as we are\r\nconsidering systems of extended distribution employing vast numbers of\r\nlamps (as in New York City, where millions are in use), it will be seen\r\nthat such a method would lead to inextricable confusion, and therefore\r\nbe absolutely out of the question. Inasmuch as the percentage of\r\ndrop decreases in proportion to the increased cross-section of the\r\nconductors, the only feasible plan would seem to be to increase their\r\nsize to such dimensions as to eliminate the drop altogether, beginning\r\nwith conductors of large cross-section and tapering off as necessary.\r\nThis would, indeed, obviate the trouble, but, on the other hand, would\r\ngive rise to a much more serious difficulty--namely, the enormous\r\noutlay for copper; an outlay so great as to be absolutely prohibitory in\r\nconsidering the electric lighting of large districts, as now practiced.\r\n\r\nAnother diagram will probably make this more clear. The reference\r\nfigures are used as before, except that the horizontal lines extending\r\nfrom square marked G represent the main conductors. As each lamp\r\nrequires and takes its own proportion of the total current generated,\r\nit is obvious that the size of the conductors to carry the current for\r\na number of lamps must be as large as the sum of ALL the separate\r\nconductors which would be required to carry the necessary amount of\r\ncurrent to each lamp separately. Hence, in a primitive multiple-arc\r\nsystem, it was found that the system must have conductors of a size\r\nequal to the aggregate of the individual conductors necessary for every\r\nlamp. Such conductors might either be separate, as shown above (Fig.\r\n2), or be bunched together, or made into a solid tapering conductor, as\r\nshown in the following figure:\r\n\r\nThe enormous mass of copper needed in such a system can be better\r\nappreciated by a concrete example. Some years ago Mr. W. J. Jenks made\r\na comparative calculation which showed that such a system of conductors\r\n(known as the \"Tree\" system), to supply 8640 lamps in a territory\r\nextending over so small an area as nine city blocks, would require\r\n803,250 pounds of copper, which at the then price of 25 cents per pound\r\nwould cost $200,812.50!\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, was the state of the art, generally speaking, at the\r\nperiod above named (1878-79). As early in the art as the latter end of\r\nthe year 1878, Edison had developed his ideas sufficiently to determine\r\nthat the problem of electric illumination by small units could be solved\r\nby using incandescent lamps of high resistance and small radiating\r\nsurface, and by distributing currents of constant potential thereto in\r\nmultiple arc by means of a ramification of conductors, starting from a\r\ncentral source and branching therefrom in every direction. This was\r\nan equivalent of the method illustrated in Fig. 3, known as the \"Tree\"\r\nsystem, and was, in fact, the system used by Edison in the first\r\nand famous exhibition of his electric light at Menlo Park around the\r\nChristmas period of 1879. He realized, however, that the enormous\r\ninvestment for copper would militate against the commercial adoption of\r\nelectric lighting on an extended scale. His next inventive step\r\ncovered the division of a large city district into a number of small\r\nsub-stations supplying current through an interconnected network of\r\nconductors, thus reducing expenditure for copper to some extent, because\r\neach distribution unit was small and limited the drop.\r\n\r\nHis next development was the radical advancement of the state of the art\r\nto the feeder system, covered by the patent now under discussion.\r\nThis invention swept away the tree and other systems, and at one bound\r\nbrought into being the possibility of effectively distributing large\r\ncurrents over extended areas with a commercially reasonable investment\r\nfor copper.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principles of this invention were, first, to sever\r\nentirely any direct connection of the main conductors with the source of\r\nenergy; and, second, to feed current at a constant potential to central\r\npoints in such main conductors by means of other conductors, called\r\n\"feeders,\" which were to be connected directly with the source of energy\r\nat the central station. This idea will be made more clear by reference\r\nto the following simple diagram, in which the same letters are used as\r\nbefore, with additions:\r\n\r\nIn further elucidation of the diagram, it may be considered that the\r\nmains are laid in the street along a city block, more or less distant\r\nfrom the station, while the feeders are connected at one end with the\r\nsource of energy at the station, their other extremities being connected\r\nto the mains at central points of distribution. Of course, this system\r\nwas intended to be applied in every part of a district to be supplied\r\nwith current, separate sets of feeders running out from the station to\r\nthe various centres. The distribution mains were to be of sufficiently\r\nlarge size that between their most extreme points the loss would not\r\nbe more than 3 volts. Such a slight difference would not make an\r\nappreciable variation in the candle-power of the lamps.\r\n\r\nBy the application of these principles, the inevitable but useless loss,\r\nor \"drop,\" required by economy might be incurred, but was LOCALIZED IN\r\nTHE FEEDERS, where it would not affect the uniformity of illumination\r\nof the lamps in any of the circuits, whether near to or remote from the\r\nstation, because any variations of loss in the feeders would not give\r\nrise to similar fluctuations in any lamp circuit. The feeders might be\r\noperated at any desired percentage of loss that would realize economy in\r\ncopper, so long as they delivered current to the main conductors at the\r\npotential represented by the average voltage of the lamps.\r\n\r\nThus the feeders could be made comparatively small in cross-section. It\r\nwill be at once appreciated that, inasmuch as the mains required to be\r\nlaid ONLY along the blocks to be lighted, and were not required to be\r\nrun all the way to the central station (which might be half a mile or\r\nmore away), the saving of copper by Edison's feeder system was enormous.\r\nIndeed, the comparative calculation of Mr. Jenks, above referred to,\r\nshows that to operate the same number of lights in the same extended\r\narea of territory, the feeder system would require only 128,739 pounds\r\nof copper, which, at the then price of 25 cents per pound, would cost\r\nonly $39,185, or A SAVING of $168,627.50 for copper in this very small\r\ndistrict of only nine blocks.\r\n\r\nAn additional illustration, appealing to the eye, is presented in the\r\nfollowing sketch, in which the comparative masses of copper of the tree\r\nand feeder systems for carrying the same current are shown side by side:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. THE THREE-WIRE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nTHIS invention is covered by United States Patent No. 274,290, issued to\r\nEdison on March 20, 1883. The object of the invention was to provide\r\nfor increased economy in the quantity of copper employed for the main\r\nconductors in electric light and power installations of considerable\r\nextent at the same time preserving separate and independent control\r\nof each lamp, motor, or other translating device, upon any one of the\r\nvarious distribution circuits.\r\n\r\nImmediately prior to this invention the highest state of the art of\r\nelectrical distribution was represented by Edison's feeder system, which\r\nhas already been described as a straight parallel or multiple-arc\r\nsystem wherein economy of copper was obtained by using separate sets\r\nof conductors--minus load--feeding current at standard potential or\r\nelectrical pressure into the mains at centres of distribution.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the incandescent lamp which was accepted\r\nat the time as a standard (and has so remained to the present day) was\r\na lamp of 110 volts or thereabouts. In using the word \"standard,\"\r\ntherefore, it is intended that the same shall apply to lamps of about\r\nthat voltage, as well as to electrical circuits of the approximate\r\npotential to operate them.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, the principle involved in the three-wire system is to\r\nprovide main circuits of double the standard potential, so as to operate\r\nstandard lamps, or other translating devices, in multiple series of two\r\nto each series; and for the purpose of securing independent, individual\r\ncontrol of each unit, to divide each main circuit into any desired\r\nnumber of derived circuits of standard potential (properly balanced)\r\nby means of a central compensating conductor which would be normally\r\nneutral, but designed to carry any minor excess of current that might\r\nflow by reason of any temporary unbalancing of either side of the main\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nReference to the following diagrams will elucidate this principle more\r\nclearly than words alone can do. For the purpose of increased lucidity\r\nwe will first show a plain multiple-series system.\r\n\r\nIn this diagram G<1S> and G<2S> represent two generators, each producing\r\ncurrent at a potential of 110 volts. By connecting them in series this\r\npotential is doubled, thus providing a main circuit (P and N) of 220\r\nvolts. The figures marked L represent eight lamps of 110 volts each, in\r\nmultiple series of two, in four derived circuits. The arrows indicate\r\nthe flow of current. By this method each pair of lamps takes, together,\r\nonly the same quantity or volume of current required by a single lamp in\r\na simple multiple-arc system; and, as the cross-section of a conductor\r\ndepends upon the quantity of current carried, such an arrangement as\r\nthe above would allow the use of conductors of only one-fourth the\r\ncross-section that would be otherwise required. From the standpoint of\r\neconomy of investment such an arrangement would be highly desirable,\r\nbut considered commercially it is impracticable because the principle of\r\nindependent control of each unit would be lost, as the turning out of a\r\nlamp in any series would mean the extinguishment of its companion also.\r\nBy referring to the diagram it will be seen that each series of two\r\nforms one continuous path between the main conductors, and if this path\r\nbe broken at any one point current will immediately cease to flow in\r\nthat particular series.\r\n\r\nEdison, by his invention of the three-wire system, overcame this\r\ndifficulty entirely, and at the same time conserved approximately, the\r\nsaving of copper, as will be apparent from the following illustration of\r\nthat system, in its simplest form.\r\n\r\nThe reference figures are similar to those in the preceding diagram,\r\nand all conditions are also alike except that a central compensating, or\r\nbalancing, conductor, PN, is here introduced. This is technically termed\r\nthe \"neutral\" wire, and in the discharge of its functions lies the\r\nsolution of the problem of economical distribution. Theoretically, a\r\nthree-wire installation is evenly balanced by wiring for an equal number\r\nof lamps on both sides. If all these lamps were always lighted, burned,\r\nand extinguished simultaneously the central conductor would, in fact,\r\nremain neutral, as there would be no current passing through it, except\r\nfrom lamp to lamp. In practice, however, no such perfect conditions can\r\nobtain, hence the necessity of the provision for balancing in order to\r\nmaintain the principle of independent control of each unit.\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent that the arrangement shown in Fig. 2 comprises\r\npractically two circuits combined in one system, in which the central\r\nconductor, PN, in case of emergency, serves in two capacities--namely,\r\nas negative to generator G<1S> or as positive to generator G<2S>,\r\nalthough normally neutral. There are two sides to the system, the\r\npositive side being represented by the conductors P and PN, and the\r\nnegative side by the conductors PN and N. Each side, if considered\r\nseparately, has a potential of about 110 volts, yet the potential of the\r\ntwo outside conductors, P and N, is 220 volts. The lamps are 110 volts.\r\n\r\nIn practical use the operation of the system is as follows: If all the\r\nlamps were lighted the current would flow along P and through each pair\r\nof lamps to N, and so back to the source of energy. In this case the\r\nbalance is preserved and the central wire remains neutral, as no return\r\ncurrent flows through it to the source of energy. But let us suppose\r\nthat one lamp on the positive side is extinguished. None of the other\r\nlamps is affected thereby, but the system is immediately thrown out of\r\nbalance, and on the positive side there is an excess of current to this\r\nextent which flows along or through the central conductor and returns to\r\nthe generator, the central conductor thus becoming the negative of that\r\nside of the system for the time being. If the lamp extinguished had been\r\none of those on the negative side of the system results of a similar\r\nnature would obtain, except that the central conductor would for the\r\ntime being become the positive of that side, and the excess of current\r\nwould flow through the negative, N, back to the source of energy. Thus\r\nit will be seen that a three-wire system, considered as a whole, is\r\nelastic in that it may operate as one when in balance and as two when\r\nunbalanced, but in either event giving independent control of each unit.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity of illustration a limited number of circuits, shown in\r\nFig. 2, has been employed. In practice, however, where great numbers\r\nof lamps are in use (as, for instance, in New York City, where about\r\n7,000,000 lamps are operated from various central stations), there is\r\nconstantly occurring more or less change in the balance of many circuits\r\nextending over considerable distances, but of course there is a net\r\nresult which is always on one side of the system or the other for the\r\ntime being, and this is met by proper adjustment at the appropriate\r\ngenerator in the station.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the explanation complete, there is presented another\r\ndiagram showing a three-wire system unbalanced:\r\n\r\nThe reference figures are used as before, but in this case the vertical\r\nlines represent branches taken from the main conductors into buildings\r\nor other spaces to be lighted, and the loops between these branch wires\r\nrepresent lamps in operation. It will be seen from this sketch that\r\nthere are ten lamps on the positive side and twelve on the negative\r\nside. Hence, the net result is an excess of current equal to that\r\nrequired by two lamps flowing through the central or compensating\r\nconductor, which is now acting as positive to generator G<2S> The arrows\r\nshow the assumed direction of flow of current throughout the system,\r\nand the small figures at the arrow-heads the volume of that current\r\nexpressed in the number of lamps which it supplies.\r\n\r\nThe commercial value of this invention may be appreciated from the fact\r\nthat by the application of its principles there is effected a saving\r\nof 62 1/2 per cent. of the amount of copper over that which would\r\nbe required for conductors in any previously devised two-wire system\r\ncarrying the same load. This arises from the fact that by the doubling\r\nof potential the two outside mains are reduced to one-quarter the\r\ncross-section otherwise necessary. A saving of 75 per cent. would thus\r\nbe assured, but the addition of a third, or compensating, conductor of\r\nthe same cross-section as one of the outside mains reduces the total\r\nsaving to 62 1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe three-wire system is in universal use throughout the world at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. EDISON'S ELECTRIC RAILWAY\r\n\r\nAS narrated in Chapter XVIII, there were two electric railroads\r\ninstalled by Edison at Menlo Park--one in 1880, originally a third of a\r\nmile long, but subsequently increased to about a mile in length, and the\r\nother in 1882, about three miles long. As the 1880 road was built very\r\nsoon after Edison's notable improvements in dynamo machines, and as the\r\nart of operating them to the best advantage was then being developed,\r\nthis early road was somewhat crude as compared with the railroad of\r\n1882; but both were practicable and serviceable for the purpose of\r\nhauling passengers and freight. The scope of the present article will\r\nbe confined to a description of the technical details of these two\r\ninstallations.\r\n\r\nThe illustration opposite page 454 of the preceding narrative shows the\r\nfirst Edison locomotive and train of 1880 at Menlo Park.\r\n\r\nFor the locomotive a four-wheel iron truck was used, and upon it\r\nwas mounted one of the long \"Z\" type 110-volt Edison dynamos, with a\r\ncapacity of 75 amperes, which was to be used as a motor. This machine\r\nwas laid on its side, its armature being horizontal and located toward\r\nthe front of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nWe now quote from an article by Mr. E. W. Hammer, published in the\r\nElectrical World, New York, June 10, 1899, and afterward elaborated and\r\nreprinted in a volume entitled Edisonia, compiled and published under\r\nthe auspices of a committee of the Association of Edison Illuminating\r\nCompanies, in 1904: \"The gearing originally employed consisted of a\r\nfriction-pulley upon the armature shaft, another friction-pulley upon\r\nthe driven axle, and a third friction-pulley which could be brought\r\nin contact with the other two by a suitable lever. Each wheel of the\r\nlocomotive was made with metallic rim and a centre portion made of wood\r\nor papier-mache. A three-legged spider connected the metal rim of each\r\nfront wheel to a brass hub, upon which rested a collecting brush.\r\nThe other wheels were subsequently so equipped. It was the intention,\r\ntherefore, that the current should enter the locomotive wheels at one\r\nside, and after passing through the metal spiders, collecting brushes\r\nand motor, would pass out through the corresponding brushes, spiders,\r\nand wheels to the other rail.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the road: \"The rails were light and were spiked to ordinary\r\nsleepers, with a gauge of about three and one-half feet. The sleepers\r\nwere laid upon the natural grade, and there was comparatively no effort\r\nmade to ballast the road. . . . No special precautions were taken to\r\ninsulate the rails from the earth or from each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe road started about fifty feet away from the generating station,\r\nwhich in this case was the machine shop. Two of the \"Z\" type dynamos\r\nwere used for generating the current, which was conveyed to the two\r\nrails of the road by underground conductors.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, May 13, 1880, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, this historic\r\nlocomotive made its first trip, packed with as many of the \"boys\" as\r\ncould possibly find a place to hang on. \"Everything worked to a charm,\r\nuntil, in starting up at one end of the road, the friction gearing\r\nwas brought into action too suddenly and it was wrecked. This accident\r\ndemonstrated that some other method of connecting the armature with the\r\ndriven axle should be arranged.\r\n\r\n\"As thus originally operated, the motor had its field circuit in\r\npermanent connection as a shunt across the rails, and this field circuit\r\nwas protected by a safety-catch made by turning up two bare ends of the\r\nwire in its circuit and winding a piece of fine copper wire across from\r\none bare end to the other. The armature circuit had a switch in it which\r\npermitted the locomotive to be reversed by reversing the direction of\r\ncurrent flow through the armature.\r\n\r\n\"After some consideration of the gearing question, it was decided to\r\nemploy belts instead of the friction-pulleys.\" Accordingly, Edison\r\ninstalled on the locomotive a system of belting, including an\r\nidler-pulley which was used by means of a lever to tighten the main\r\ndriving-belt, and thus power was applied to the driven axle. This\r\ninvolved some slipping and consequent burning of belts; also, if the\r\nbelt were prematurely tightened, the burning-out of the armature.\r\nThis latter event happened a number of times, \"and proved to be such\r\na serious annoyance that resistance-boxes were brought out from the\r\nlaboratory and placed upon the locomotive in series with the armature.\r\nThis solved the difficulty. The locomotive would be started with these\r\nresistance-boxes in circuit, and after reaching full speed the operator\r\ncould plug the various boxes out of circuit, and in that way increase\r\nthe speed.\" To stop, the armature circuit was opened by the main switch\r\nand the brake applied.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was generally satisfactory, but the resistance-boxes\r\nscattered about the platform and foot-rests being in the way, Edison\r\ndirected that some No. 8 B. & S. copper wire be wound on the lower leg\r\nof the motor field-magnet. \"By doing this the resistance was put\r\nwhere it would take up the least room, and where it would serve as an\r\nadditional field-coil when starting the motor, and it replaced all the\r\nresistance-boxes which had heretofore been in plain sight. The boxes\r\nunder the seat were still retained in service. The coil of coarse wire\r\nwas in series with the armature, just as the resistance-boxes had been,\r\nand could be plugged in or out of circuit at the will of the locomotive\r\ndriver. The general arrangement thus secured was operated as long as\r\nthis road was in commission.\"\r\n\r\nOn this short stretch of road there were many sharp curves and steep\r\ngrades, and in consequence of the high speed attained (as high as\r\nforty-two miles an hour) several derailments took place, but fortunately\r\nwithout serious results. Three cars were in service during the entire\r\ntime of operating this 1880 railroad: one a flat-car for freight; one an\r\nopen car with two benches placed back to back; and the third a box-car,\r\nfamiliarly known as the \"Pullman.\" This latter car had an interesting\r\nadjunct in an electric braking system (covered by Edison's Patent No.\r\n248,430). \"Each car axle had a large iron disk mounted on and revolving\r\nwith it between the poles of a powerful horseshoe electromagnet. The\r\npole-pieces of the magnet were movable, and would be attracted to the\r\nrevolving disk when the magnet was energized, grasping the same and\r\nacting to retard the revolution of the car axle.\"\r\n\r\nInteresting articles on Edison's first electric railroad were published\r\nin the technical and other papers, among which may be mentioned the New\r\nYork Herald, May 15 and July 23, 1880; the New York Graphic, July 27,\r\n1880; and the Scientific American, June 6, 1880.\r\n\r\nEdison's second electric railroad of 1882 was more pretentious as\r\nregards length, construction, and equipment. It was about three miles\r\nlong, of nearly standard gauge, and substantially constructed. Curves\r\nwere modified, and grades eliminated where possible by the erection\r\nof numerous trestles. This road also had some features of conventional\r\nrailroads, such as sidings, turn-tables, freight platform, and\r\ncar-house. \"Current was supplied to the road by underground feeder\r\ncables from the dynamo-room of the laboratory. The rails were insulated\r\nfrom the ties by giving them two coats of japan, baking them in the\r\noven, and then placing them on pads of tar-impregnated muslin laid\r\non the ties. The ends of the rails were not japanned, but were\r\nelectroplated, to give good contact surfaces for fish-plates and copper\r\nbonds.\"\r\n\r\nThe following notes of Mr. Frederick A. Scheffler, who designed the\r\npassenger locomotive for the 1882 road, throw an interesting light on\r\nits technical details:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In May, 1881, I was engaged by Mr. M. F. Moore, who was the first\r\nGeneral Manager of the Edison Company for Isolated Lighting, as a\r\ndraftsman to undertake the work of designing and building Edison's\r\nelectric locomotive No. 2.\r\n\r\n\"Previous to that time I had been employed in the engineering department\r\nof Grant Locomotive Works, Paterson, New Jersey, and the Rhode Island\r\nLocomotive Works, Providence, Rhode Island....\r\n\r\n\"It was Mr. Edison's idea, as I understood it at that time, to build a\r\nlocomotive along the general lines of steam locomotives (at least,\r\nin outward appearance), and to combine in that respect the framework,\r\ntruck, and other parts known to be satisfactory in steam locomotives at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n\"This naturally required the services of a draftsman accustomed to\r\nsteam-locomotive practice.... Mr. Moore was a man of great railroad and\r\nlocomotive experience, and his knowledge in that direction was of great\r\nassistance in the designing and building of this locomotive.\r\n\r\n\"At that time I had no knowledge of electricity.... One could count\r\nso-called electrical engineers on his fingers then, and have some\r\nfingers left over.\r\n\r\n\"Consequently, the ELECTRICAL equipment was designed by Mr. Edison and\r\nhis assistants. The data and parts, such as motor, rheostat, switches,\r\netc., were given to me, and my work was to design the supporting frame,\r\naxles, countershafts, driving mechanism, speed control, wheels and\r\nboxes, cab, running board, pilot (or 'cow-catcher'), buffers, and\r\neven supports for the headlight. I believe I also designed a bell and\r\nsupports. From this it will be seen that the locomotive had all the\r\nessential paraphernalia to make it LOOK like a steam locomotive.\r\n\r\n\"The principal part of the outfit was the electric motor. At that\r\ntime motors were curiosities. There were no electric motors even for\r\nstationary purposes, except freaks built for experimental uses. This\r\nmotor was made from the parts--such as fields, armature, commutator,\r\nshaft and bearings, etc., of an Edison 'Z,' or 60-light dynamo. It was\r\nthe only size of dynamo that the Edison Company had marketed at that\r\ntime.... As a motor, it was wound to run at maximum speed to develop\r\na torque equal to about fifteen horse-power with 220 volts. At the\r\ngenerating station at Menlo Park four Z dynamos of 110 volts were used,\r\nconnected two in series, in multiple arc, giving a line voltage of 220.\r\n\r\n\"The motor was located in the front part of the locomotive, on its side,\r\nwith the armature shaft across the frames, or parallel with the driving\r\naxles.\r\n\r\n\"On account of the high speed of the armature shaft it was not possible\r\nto connect with driving-axles direct, but this was an advantage in one\r\nway, as by introducing an intermediate counter-shaft (corresponding to\r\nthe well-known type of double-reduction motor used on trolley-cars since\r\n1885), a fairly good arrangement was obtained to regulate the speed of\r\nthe locomotive, exclusive of resistance in the electric circuit.\r\n\r\n\"Endless leather belting was used to transmit the power from the motor\r\nto the counter-shaft, and from the latter to the driving-wheels, which\r\nwere the front pair. A vertical idler-pulley was mounted in a frame over\r\nthe belt from motor to counter-shaft, terminating in a vertical screw\r\nand hand-wheel for tightening the belt to increase speed, or the reverse\r\nto lower speed. This hand-wheel was located in the cab, where it was\r\neasily accessible....\r\n\r\n\"The rough outline sketched below shows the location of motor in\r\nrelation to counter-shaft, belting, driving-wheels, idler, etc.:\r\n\r\n\"On account of both rails being used for circuits, . . . the\r\ndriving-wheels had to be split circumferentially and completely\r\ninsulated from the axles. This was accomplished by means of heavy wood\r\nblocks well shellacked or otherwise treated to make them water and\r\nweather proof, placed radially on the inside of the wheels, and then\r\nsubstantially bolted to the hubs and rims of the latter.\r\n\r\n\"The weight of the locomotive was distributed over the driving-wheels in\r\nthe usual locomotive practice by means of springs and equalizers.\r\n\r\n\"The current was taken from the rims of the driving-wheels by a\r\nthree-pronged collector of brass, against which flexible copper brushes\r\nwere pressed--a simple manner of overcoming any inequalities of the\r\nroad-bed.\r\n\r\n\"The late Mr. Charles T. Hughes was in charge of the track construction\r\nat Menlo Park.... His work was excellent throughout, and the results\r\nwere highly satisfactory so far as they could possibly be with the\r\narrangement originally planned by Mr. Edison and his assistants.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Charles L. Clarke, one of the earliest electrical engineers\r\nemployed by Mr. Edison, made a number of tests on this 1882 railroad. I\r\nbelieve that the engine driving the four Z generators at the power-house\r\nindicated as high as seventy horse-power at the time the locomotive was\r\nactually in service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe electrical features of the 1882 locomotive were very similar\r\nto those of the earlier one, already described. Shunt and series\r\nfield-windings were added to the motor, and the series windings could\r\nbe plugged in and out of circuit as desired. The series winding was\r\nsupplemented by resistance-boxes, also capable of being plugged in or\r\nout of circuit. These various electrical features are diagrammatically\r\nshown in Fig. 2, which also illustrates the connection with the\r\ngenerating plant.\r\n\r\nWe quote again from Mr. Hammer, who says: \"The freight-locomotive had\r\nsingle reduction gears, as is the modern practice, but the power was\r\napplied through a friction-clutch The passenger-locomotive was very\r\nspeedy, and ninety passengers have been carried at a time by it; the\r\nfreight-locomotive was not so fast, but could pull heavy trains at a\r\ngood speed. Many thousand people were carried on this road during 1882.\"\r\nThe general appearance of Edison's electric locomotive of 1882 is shown\r\nin the illustration opposite page 462 of the preceding narrative. In the\r\npicture Mr. Edison may be seen in the cab, and Mr. Insull on the front\r\nplatform of the passenger-car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. TRAIN TELEGRAPHY\r\n\r\nWHILE the one-time art of telegraphing to and from moving trains was\r\nessentially a wireless system, and allied in some of its principles to\r\nthe art of modern wireless telegraphy through space, the two systems\r\ncannot, strictly speaking be regarded as identical, as the practice of\r\nthe former was based entirely on the phenomenon of induction.\r\n\r\nBriefly described in outline, the train telegraph system consisted of\r\nan induction circuit obtained by laying strips of metal along the top or\r\nroof of a railway-car, and the installation of a special telegraph\r\nline running parallel with the track and strung on poles of only medium\r\nheight. The train, and also each signalling station, was equipped\r\nwith regulation telegraph apparatus, such as battery, key, relay, and\r\nsounder, together with induction-coil and condenser. In addition, there\r\nwas a special transmitting device in the shape of a musical reed, or\r\n\"buzzer.\" In practice, this buzzer was continuously operated at a speed\r\nof about five hundred vibrations per second by an auxiliary battery. Its\r\nvibrations were broken by means of a telegraph key into long and\r\nshort periods, representing Morse characters, which were transmitted\r\ninductively from the train circuit to the pole line or vice versa, and\r\nreceived by the operator at the other end through a high-resistance\r\ntelephone receiver inserted in the secondary circuit of the\r\ninduction-coil.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagrammatic sketch of a simple form of the system, as\r\ninstalled on a car, will probably serve to make this more clear.\r\n\r\nAn insulated wire runs from the metallic layers on the roof of the car\r\nto switch S, which is shown open in the sketch. When a message is to be\r\nreceived on the car from a station more or less remote, the switch\r\nis thrown to the left to connect with a wire running to the telephone\r\nreceiver, T. The other wire from this receiver is run down to one of\r\nthe axles and there permanently connected, thus making a ground. The\r\noperator puts the receiver to his ear and listens for the message, which\r\nthe telephone renders audible in the Morse characters.\r\n\r\nIf a message is to be transmitted from the car to a receiving station,\r\nnear or distant, the switch, S, is thrown to the other side, thus\r\nconnecting with a wire leading to one end of the secondary of\r\ninduction-coil C. The other end of the secondary is connected with the\r\ngrounding wire. The primary of the induction-coil is connected as shown,\r\none end going to key K and the other to the buzzer circuit. The other\r\nside of the key is connected to the transmitting battery, while the\r\nopposite pole of this battery is connected in the buzzer circuit. The\r\nbuzzer, R, is maintained in rapid vibration by its independent auxiliary\r\nbattery, B<1S>.\r\n\r\nWhen the key is pressed down the circuit is closed, and current from\r\nthe transmitting battery, B, passes through primary of the coil, C, and\r\ninduces a current of greatly increased potential in the secondary.\r\nThe current as it passes into the primary, being broken up into short\r\nimpulses by the tremendously rapid vibrations of the buzzer, induces\r\nsimilarly rapid waves of high potential in the secondary, and these\r\nin turn pass to the roof and thence through the intervening air by\r\ninduction to the telegraph wire. By a continued lifting and depression\r\nof the key in the regular manner, these waves are broken up into long\r\nand short periods, and are thus transmitted to the station, via the\r\nwire, in Morse characters, dots and dashes.\r\n\r\nThe receiving stations along the line of the railway were similarly\r\nequipped as to apparatus, and, generally speaking the operations of\r\nsending and receiving messages were substantially the same as above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of an operator on a car was quite simple consisting merely\r\nof a small lap-board, on which were mounted the key, coil, and buzzer,\r\nleaving room for telegraph blanks. To this board were also attached\r\nflexible conductors having spring clips, by means of which connections\r\ncould be made quickly with conveniently placed terminals of the ground,\r\nroof, and battery wires. The telephone receiver was held on the head\r\nwith a spring, the flexible connecting wire being attached to the lap\r\nboard, thus leaving the operator with both hands free.\r\n\r\nThe system, as shown in the sketch and elucidated by the text,\r\nrepresents the operation of train telegraphy in a simple form, but\r\ncombining the main essentials of the art as it was successfully and\r\ncommercially practiced for a number of years after Edison and Gilliland\r\nentered the field. They elaborated the system in various ways, making it\r\nmore complete; but it has not been deemed necessary to enlarge further\r\nupon the technical minutiae of the art for the purpose of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. KINETOGRAPH AND PROJECTING KINETOSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH many of the arts in which Edison has been a pioneer have been\r\nenriched by his numerous inventions and patents, which were subsequent\r\nto those of a fundamental nature, the (so-called) motion-picture art\r\nis an exception, as the following, together with three other additional\r\npatents [30] comprise all that he has taken out on this subject: United\r\nStates Patent No. 589,168, issued August 31, 1897, reissued in two\r\nparts--namely, No. 12,037, under date of September 30,1902, and No.\r\n12,192, under date of January 12, 1904. Application filed August 24,\r\n1891.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 30: Not 491,993, issued February 21, 1893; No.\r\n     493,426, issued March 14, 1893; No. 772,647, issued October\r\n     18, 1904.]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing surprising in this, however, as the possibility of\r\nphotographing and reproducing actual scenes of animate life are so\r\nthoroughly exemplified and rendered practicable by the apparatus\r\nand methods disclosed in the patents above cited, that these basic\r\ninventions in themselves practically constitute the art--its development\r\nproceeding mainly along the line of manufacturing details. That such\r\na view of his work is correct, the highest criterion--commercial\r\nexpediency--bears witness; for in spite of the fact that the courts have\r\nsomewhat narrowed the broad claims of Edison's patents by reason of the\r\ninvestigations of earlier experimenters, practically all the immense\r\namount of commercial work that is done in the motion-picture field\r\nto-day is accomplished through the use of apparatus and methods licensed\r\nunder the Edison patents.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of this invention having already been described in\r\nChapter XXI, it will be unnecessary to repeat it here. Suffice it to say\r\nby way of reminder that it is founded upon the physiological phenomenon\r\nknown as the persistence of vision, through which a series of sequential\r\nphotographic pictures of animate motion projected upon a screen in rapid\r\nsuccession will reproduce to the eye all the appearance of the original\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nEdison's work in this direction comprised the invention not only of a\r\nspecial form of camera for making original photographic exposures from a\r\nsingle point of view with very great rapidity, and of a machine adapted\r\nto effect the reproduction of such pictures in somewhat similar manner\r\nbut also of the conception and invention of a continuous uniform, and\r\nevenly spaced tape-like film, so absolutely essential for both the above\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of such a camera, as now used, consists of many\r\nparts assembled in such contiguous proximity to each other that an\r\nillustration from an actual machine would not help to clearness of\r\nexplanation to the general reader. Hence a diagram showing a sectional\r\nview of a simple form of such a camera is presented below.\r\n\r\nIn this diagram, A represents an outer light-tight box containing a\r\nlens, C, and the other necessary mechanism for making the photographic\r\nexposures, H<1S> and H<2S> being cases for holding reels of film before\r\nand after exposure, F the long, tape-like film, G a sprocket whose teeth\r\nengage in perforations on the edges of the film, such sprocket being\r\nadapted to be revolved with an intermittent or step-by-step movement\r\nby hand or by motor, and B a revolving shutter having an opening and\r\nconnected by gears with G, and arranged to expose the film during the\r\nperiods of rest. A full view of this shutter is also represented, with\r\nits opening, D, in the small illustration to the right.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the operation would be somewhat as follows, generally\r\nspeaking: The lens would first be focussed on the animate scene to be\r\nphotographed. On turning the main shaft of the camera the sprocket, G,\r\nis moved intermittently, and its teeth, catching in the holes in the\r\nsensitized film, draws it downward, bringing a new portion of its length\r\nin front of the lens, the film then remaining stationary for an instant.\r\nIn the mean time, through gearing connecting the main shaft with the\r\nshutter, the latter is rotated, bringing its opening, D, coincident with\r\nthe lens, and therefore exposing the film while it is stationary, after\r\nwhich the film again moves forward. So long as the action is continued\r\nthese movements are repeated, resulting in a succession of enormously\r\nrapid exposures upon the film during its progress from reel H<1S> to its\r\nautomatic rewinding on reel H<2S>. While the film is passing through the\r\nvarious parts of the machine it is guided and kept straight by various\r\nsets of rollers between which it runs, as indicated in the diagram.\r\n\r\nBy an ingenious arrangement of the mechanism, the film moves\r\nintermittently so that it may have a much longer period of rest than\r\nof motion. As in practice the pictures are taken at a rate of twenty or\r\nmore per second, it will be quite obvious that each period of rest is\r\ninfinitesimally brief, being generally one-thirtieth of a second or\r\nless. Still it is sufficient to bring the film to a momentary condition\r\nof complete rest, and to allow for a maximum time of exposure,\r\ncomparatively speaking, thus providing means for taking clearly defined\r\npictures. The negatives so obtained are developed in the regular\r\nway, and the positive prints subsequently made from them are used for\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nThe reproducing machine, or, as it is called in practice, the Projecting\r\nKinetoscope, is quite similar so far as its general operations in\r\nhandling the film are concerned. In appearance it is somewhat different;\r\nindeed, it is in two parts, the one containing the lighting arrangements\r\nand condensing lens, and the other embracing the mechanism and objective\r\nlens. The \"taking\" camera must have its parts enclosed in a light-tight\r\nbox, because of the undeveloped, sensitized film, but the projecting\r\nkinetoscope, using only a fully developed positive film, may, and,\r\nfor purposes of convenient operation, must be accessibly open. The\r\nillustration (Fig. 2) will show the projecting apparatus as used in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of reproduction is very simple, and is illustrated\r\ndiagrammatically in Fig. 3, reference letters being the same as in Fig.\r\n1. As to the additional reference letters, I is a condenser J the source\r\nof light, and K a reflector.\r\n\r\nThe positive film is moved intermittently but swiftly throughout its\r\nlength between the objective lens and a beam of light coming through the\r\ncondenser, being exposed by the shutter during the periods of rest. This\r\nresults in a projection of the photographs upon a screen in such rapid\r\nsuccession as to present an apparently continuous photograph of the\r\nsuccessive positions of the moving objects, which, therefore, appear to\r\nthe human eye to be in motion.\r\n\r\nThe first claim of Reissue Patent No. 12,192 describes the film. It\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An unbroken transparent or translucent tape-like photographic film\r\nhaving thereon uniform, sharply defined, equidistant photographs of\r\nsuccessive positions of an object in motion as observed from a single\r\npoint of view at rapidly recurring intervals of time, such photographs\r\nbeing arranged in a continuous straight-line sequence, unlimited in\r\nnumber save by the length of the film, and sufficient in number to\r\nrepresent the movements of the object throughout an extended period of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. EDISON'S ORE-MILLING INVENTIONS\r\n\r\nTHE wide range of Edison's activities in this department of the arts is\r\nwell represented in the diversity of the numerous patents that have been\r\nissued to him from time to time. These patents are between fifty and\r\nsixty in number, and include magnetic ore separators of ten distinct\r\ntypes; also breaking, crushing, and grinding rolls, conveyors,\r\ndust-proof bearings, screens, driers, mixers, bricking apparatus and\r\nmachines, ovens, and processes of various kinds.\r\n\r\nA description of the many devices in each of these divisions would\r\nrequire more space than is available; hence, we shall confine ourselves\r\nto a few items of predominating importance, already referred to in the\r\nnarrative, commencing with the fundamental magnetic ore separator, which\r\nwas covered by United States Patent No. 228,329, issued June 1, 1880.\r\n\r\nThe illustration here presented is copied from the drawing forming part\r\nof this patent. A hopper with adjustable feed is supported several feet\r\nabove a bin having a central partition. Almost midway between the hopper\r\nand the bin is placed an electromagnet whose polar extension is so\r\narranged as to be a little to one side of a stream of material falling\r\nfrom the hopper. Normally, a stream of finely divided ore falling from\r\nthe hopper would fall into that portion of the bin lying to the left\r\nof the partition. If, however, the magnet is energized from a source of\r\ncurrent, the magnetic particles in the falling stream are attracted\r\nby and move toward the magnet, which is so placed with relation to\r\nthe falling material that the magnetic particles cannot be attracted\r\nentirely to the magnet before gravity has carried them past. Hence,\r\ntheir trajectory is altered, and they fall on the right-hand side of\r\nthe partition in the bin, while the non-magnetic portion of the stream\r\ncontinues in a straight line and falls on the other side, thus effecting\r\na complete separation.\r\n\r\nThis simple but effective principle was the one employed by Edison\r\nin his great concentrating plant already described. In practice, the\r\nnumerous hoppers, magnets, and bins were many feet in length; and they\r\nwere arranged in batteries of varied magnetic strength, in order\r\nthat the intermingled mass of crushed rock and iron ore might be\r\nmore thoroughly separated by being passed through magnetic fields of\r\nsuccessively increasing degrees of attracting power. Altogether there\r\nwere about four hundred and eighty of these immense magnets in the\r\nplant, distributed in various buildings in batteries as above mentioned,\r\nthe crushed rock containing the iron ore being delivered to them by\r\nconveyors, and the gangue and ore being taken away after separation by\r\ntwo other conveyors and delivered elsewhere. The magnetic separators at\r\nfirst used by Edison at this plant were of the same generality as the\r\nones employed some years previously in the separation of sea-shore sand,\r\nbut greatly enlarged and improved. The varied experiences gained in\r\nthe concentration of vast quantities of ore led naturally to a greater\r\ndevelopment, and several new types and arrangements of magnetic\r\nseparators were evolved and elaborated by him from first to last, during\r\nthe progress of the work at the concentrating plant.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic separation of iron from its ore being the foundation idea\r\nof the inventions now under discussion, a consideration of the separator\r\nhas naturally taken precedence over those of collateral but inseparable\r\ninterest. The ore-bearing rock, however, must first be ground to powder\r\nbefore it can be separated; hence, we will now begin at the root of\r\nthis operation and consider the \"giant rolls,\" which Edison devised\r\nfor breaking huge masses of rock. In his application for United States\r\nPatent No. 672,616, issued April 23, 1901, applied for on July 16, 1897,\r\nhe says: \"The object of my invention is to produce a method for the\r\nbreaking of rock which will be simple and effective, will not require\r\nthe hand-sledging or blasting of the rock down to pieces of moderate\r\nsize, and will involve the consumption of a small amount of power.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this quotation refers to the method as \"simple,\" the patent under\r\nconsideration covers one of the most bold and daring projects that\r\nEdison has ever evolved. He proposed to eliminate the slow and expensive\r\nmethod of breaking large boulders manually, and to substitute therefor\r\nmomentum and kinetic energy applied through the medium of massive\r\nmachinery, which, in a few seconds, would break into small pieces a rock\r\nas big as an ordinary upright cottage piano, and weighing as much as six\r\ntons. Engineers to whom Edison communicated his ideas were unanimous\r\nin declaring the thing an impossibility; it was like driving two\r\nexpress-trains into each other at full speed to crack a great rock\r\nplaced between them; that no practical machinery could be built to\r\nstand the terrific impact and strains. Edison's convictions were\r\nstrong, however, and he persisted. The experiments were of heroic size,\r\nphysically and financially, but after a struggle of several years and\r\nan expenditure of about $100,000, he realized the correctness and\r\npracticability of his plans in the success of the giant rolls, which\r\nwere the outcome of his labors.\r\n\r\nThe giant rolls consist of a pair of iron cylinders of massive size and\r\nweight, with removable wearing plates having irregular surfaces formed\r\nby projecting knobs. These rolls are mounted side by side in a very\r\nheavy frame (leaving a gap of about fourteen inches between them), and\r\nare so belted up with the source of power that they run in opposite\r\ndirections. The giant rolls described by Edison in the above-named\r\npatent as having been built and operated by him had a combined weight of\r\n167,000 pounds, including all moving parts, which of themselves weighed\r\nabout seventy tons, each roll being six feet in diameter and five feet\r\nlong. A top view of the rolls is shown in the sketch, one roll and one\r\nof its bearings being shown in section.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2 the rolls are illustrated diagrammatically. As a sketch of\r\nthis nature, even if given with a definite scale, does not always carry\r\nan adequate idea of relative dimensions to a non-technical reader,\r\nwe present in Fig. 3 a perspective illustration of the giant rolls as\r\ninstalled in the concentrating plant.\r\n\r\nIn practice, a small amount of power is applied to run the giant rolls\r\ngradually up to a surface speed of several thousand feet a minute. When\r\nthis high speed is attained, masses of rock weighing several tons in one\r\nor more pieces are dumped into a hopper which guides them into the gap\r\nbetween the rapidly revolving rolls. The effect is to partially arrest\r\nthe swift motion of the rolls instantaneously, and thereby develop and\r\nexpend an enormous amount of kinetic energy, which with pile-driver\r\neffect cracks the rocks and breaks them into pieces small enough to\r\npass through the fourteen-inch gap. As the power is applied to the rolls\r\nthrough slipping friction-clutches, the speed of the driving-pulleys is\r\nnot materially reduced; hence the rolls may again be quickly speeded up\r\nto their highest velocity while another load of rock is being hoisted\r\nin position to be dumped into the hopper. It will be obvious from the\r\nforegoing that if it were attempted to supply the great energy necessary\r\nfor this operation by direct application of steam-power, an engine of\r\nenormous horse-power would be required, and even then it is doubtful\r\nif one could be constructed of sufficient strength to withstand the\r\nterrific strains that would ensue. But the work is done by the great\r\nmomentum and kinetic energy obtained by speeding up these tremendous\r\nmasses of metal, and then suddenly opposing their progress, the\r\nengine being relieved of all strain through the medium of the slipping\r\nfriction-clutches. Thus, this cyclopean operation may be continuously\r\nconducted with an amount of power prodigiously inferior, in proportion,\r\nto the results accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe sketch (Fig. 4) showing a large boulder being dumped into the\r\nhopper, or roll-pit, will serve to illustrate the method of feeding\r\nthese great masses of rock to the rolls, and will also enable the reader\r\nto form an idea of the rapidity of the breaking operation, when it is\r\nstated that a boulder of the size represented would be reduced by\r\nthe giant rolls to pieces a trifle larger than a man's head in a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the giant rolls the broken rock passed on through other\r\ncrushing-rolls of somewhat similar construction. These also were\r\ninvented by Edison, but antedated those previously described; being\r\ncovered by Patent No. 567,187, issued September 8, 1896. These rolls\r\nwere intended for the reducing of \"one-man-size\" rocks to small pieces,\r\nwhich at the time of their original inception was about the standard\r\nsize of similar machines. At the Edison concentrating plant the broken\r\nrock, after passing through these rolls, was further reduced in size by\r\nother rolls, and was then ready to be crushed to a fine powder through\r\nthe medium of another remarkable machine devised by Edison to meet his\r\never-recurring and well-defined ideas of the utmost economy and\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Figs. 3 and 4 are reproduced from similar sketches on pages 84\r\nand 85 of McClure's Magazine for November, 1897, by permission of S. S.\r\nMcClure Co.\r\n\r\nThe best fine grinding-machines that it was then possible to obtain were\r\nso inefficient as to involve a loss of 82 per cent. of the power\r\napplied. The thought of such an enormous loss was unbearable, and he did\r\nnot rest until he had invented and put into use an entirely new\r\ngrinding-machine, which was called the \"three-high\" rolls. The device\r\nwas covered by a patent issued to him on November 21, 1899, No. 637,327.\r\nIt was a most noteworthy invention, for it brought into the art not only\r\na greater efficiency of grinding than had ever been dreamed of before,\r\nbut also a tremendous economy by the saving of power; for whereas the\r\nprevious efficiency had been 18 per cent. and the loss 82 per cent.,\r\nEdison reversed these figures, and in his three-high rolls produced a\r\nworking efficiency of 84 per cent., thus reducing the loss of power by\r\nfriction to 16 per cent. A diagrammatic sketch of this remarkable\r\nmachine is shown in Fig. 5, which shows a front elevation with the\r\ncasings, hopper, etc., removed, and also shows above the rolls the rope\r\nand pulleys, the supports for which are also removed for the sake of\r\nclearness in the illustration.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of the reader, in referring to Fig. 5, we will\r\nrepeat the description of the three-high rolls, which is given on pages\r\n487 and 488 of the preceding narrative.\r\n\r\nIn the two end-pieces of a heavy iron frame were set three rolls, or\r\ncylinders--one in the centre, another below, and the other above--all\r\nthree being in a vertical line. These rolls were about three feet in\r\ndiameter, made of cast-iron, and had face-plates of chilled-iron. [31]\r\nThe lowest roll was set in a fixed bearing at the bottom of the frame,\r\nand, therefore, could only turn around on its axis. The middle and top\r\nrolls were free to move up or down from and toward the lower roll, and\r\nthe shafts of the middle and upper rolls were set in a loose bearing\r\nwhich could slip up and down in the iron frame. It will be apparent,\r\ntherefore, that any material which passed in between the top and the\r\nmiddle rolls, and the middle and bottom rolls, could be ground as fine\r\nas might be desired, depending entirely upon the amount of pressure\r\napplied to the loose rolls. In operation the material passed first\r\nthrough the upper and middle rolls, and then between the middle and\r\nlowest rolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 31: The faces of these rolls were smooth, but as\r\n     three-high rolls came into use later in Edison's Portland\r\n     cement operations the faces were corrugated so as to fit\r\n     into each other, gear-fashion, to provide for a high rate of\r\n     feed]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pressure was applied in a most ingenious manner. On the ends of the\r\nshafts of the bottom and top rolls there were cylindrical sleeves, or\r\nbearings, having seven sheaves in which was run a half-inch endless wire\r\nrope. This rope was wound seven times over the sheaves as above, and led\r\nupward and over a single-groove sheave, which was operated by the piston\r\nof an air-cylinder, and in this manner the pressure was applied to the\r\nrolls. It will be seen, therefore that the system consisted in a single\r\nrope passed over sheaves and so arranged that it could be varied\r\nin length, thus providing for elasticity in exerting pressure and\r\nregulating it as desired. The efficiency of this system was incomparably\r\ngreater than that of any other known crusher or grinder, for while a\r\npressure of one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds could be exerted\r\nby these rolls, friction was almost entirely eliminated, because the\r\nupper and lower roll bearings turned with the rolls and revolved in the\r\nwire rope, which constituted the bearing proper.\r\n\r\nSeveral other important patents have been issued to Edison for crushing\r\nand grinding rolls, some of them being for elaborations and improvements\r\nof those above described but all covering methods of greater economy and\r\neffectiveness in rock-grinding.\r\n\r\nEdison's work on conveyors during the period of his ore-concentrating\r\nlabors was distinctively original, ingenious and far in advance of\r\nthe times. His conception of the concentrating problem was broad and\r\nembraced an entire system, of which a principal item was the continuous\r\ntransfer of enormous quantities of material from place to place at\r\nthe lowest possible cost. As he contemplated the concentration of six\r\nthousand tons daily, the expense of manual labor to move such an immense\r\nquantity of rock, sand, and ore would be absolutely prohibitive. Hence,\r\nit became necessary to invent a system of conveyors that would be\r\ncapable of transferring this mass of material from one place to another.\r\nAnd not only must these conveyors be capable of carrying the material,\r\nbut they must also be devised so that they would automatically receive\r\nand discharge their respective loads at appointed places. Edison's\r\ningenuity, engineering ability, and inventive skill were equal to the\r\ntask, however, and were displayed in a system and variety of conveyors\r\nthat in practice seemed to act with almost human discrimination. When\r\nfully installed throughout the plant, they automatically transferred\r\ndaily a mass of material equal to about one hundred thousand cubic feet,\r\nfrom mill to mill, covering about a mile in the transit. Up and down,\r\nwinding in and out, turning corners, delivering material from one to\r\nanother, making a number of loops in the drying-oven, filling up bins\r\nand passing on to the next when they were full, these conveyors in\r\nautomatic action seemingly played their part with human intelligence,\r\nwhich was in reality the reflection of the intelligence and ingenuity\r\nthat had originally devised them and set them in motion.\r\n\r\nSix of Edison's patents on conveyors include a variety of devices that\r\nhave since came into broad general use for similar work, and have been\r\nthe means of effecting great economies in numerous industries of widely\r\nvarying kinds. Interesting as they are, however, we shall not attempt to\r\ndescribe them in detail, as the space required would be too great. They\r\nare specified in the list of patents following this Appendix, and may be\r\nexamined in detail by any interested student.\r\n\r\nIn the same list will also be found a large number of Edison's patents\r\non apparatus and methods of screening, drying, mixing, and briquetting,\r\nas well as for dust-proof bearings, and various types and groupings\r\nof separators, all of which were called forth by the exigencies and\r\nmagnitude of his great undertaking, and without which he could not\r\npossibly have attained the successful physical results that crowned his\r\nlabors. Edison's persistence in reducing the cost of his operations is\r\nnoteworthy in connection with his screening and drying inventions, in\r\nwhich the utmost advantage is taken of the law of gravitation. With\r\nits assistance, which cost nothing, these operations were performed\r\nperfectly. It was only necessary to deliver the material at the top of\r\nthe chambers, and during its natural descent it was screened or dried as\r\nthe case might be.\r\n\r\nAll these inventions and devices, as well as those described in detail\r\nabove (except magnetic separators and mixing and briquetting machines),\r\nare being used by him to-day in the manufacture of Portland cement, as\r\nthat industry presents many of the identical problems which presented\r\nthemselves in relation to the concentration of iron ore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. THE LONG CEMENT KILN\r\n\r\nIN this remarkable invention, which has brought about a striking\r\ninnovation in a long-established business, we see another characteristic\r\ninstance of Edison's incisive reasoning and boldness of conception\r\ncarried into practical effect in face of universal opinions to the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nFor the information of those unacquainted with the process of\r\nmanufacturing Portland cement, it may be stated that the material\r\nconsists preliminarily of an intimate mixture of cement rock and\r\nlimestone, ground to a very fine powder. This powder is technically\r\nknown in the trade as \"chalk,\" and is fed into rotary kilns and\r\n\"burned\"; that is to say, it is subjected to a high degree of heat\r\nobtained by the combustion of pulverized coal, which is injected\r\ninto the interior of the kiln. This combustion effects a chemical\r\ndecomposition of the chalk, and causes it to assume a plastic\r\nconsistency and to collect together in the form of small spherical\r\nballs, which are known as \"clinker.\" Kilns are usually arranged with\r\na slight incline, at the upper end of which the chalk is fed in and\r\ngradually works its way down to the interior flame of burning fuel at\r\nthe other end. When it arrives at the lower end, the material has been\r\n\"burned,\" and the clinker drops out into a receiving chamber below. The\r\noperation is continuous, a constant supply of chalk passing in at one\r\nend of the kiln and a continuous dribble of clinker-balls dropping\r\nout at the other. After cooling, the clinker is ground into very fine\r\npowder, which is the Portland cement of commerce.\r\n\r\nIt is self-evident that an ideal kiln would be one that produced the\r\nmaximum quantity of thoroughly clinkered material with a minimum amount\r\nof fuel, labor, and investment. When Edison was preparing to go into\r\nthe cement business, he looked the ground over thoroughly, and, after\r\nconsiderable investigation and experiment, came to the conclusion that\r\nprevailing conditions as to kilns were far from ideal.\r\n\r\nThe standard kilns then in use were about sixty feet in length, with an\r\ninternal diameter of about five feet. In all rotary kilns for burning\r\ncement, the true clinkering operation takes place only within a limited\r\nportion of their total length, where the heat is greatest; hence the\r\ninterior of the kiln may be considered as being divided longitudinally\r\ninto two parts or zones--namely, the combustion, or clinkering, zone,\r\nand the zone of oncoming raw material. In the sixty-foot kiln the length\r\nof the combustion zone was about ten feet, extending from a point six or\r\neight feet from the lower, or discharge, end to a point about eighteen\r\nfeet from that end. Consequently, beyond that point there was a zone of\r\nonly about forty feet, through which the heated gases passed and came\r\nin contact with the oncoming material, which was in movement down toward\r\nthe clinkering zone. Since the bulk of oncoming material was small,\r\nthe gases were not called upon to part with much of their heat, and\r\ntherefore passed on up the stack at very high temperatures, ranging from\r\n1500 degrees to 1800 degrees Fahr. Obviously, this heat was entirely\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nAn additional loss of efficiency arose from the fact that the material\r\nmoved so rapidly toward the combustion zone that it had not given up\r\nall its carbon dioxide on reaching there; and by the giving off of\r\nlarge quantities of that gas within the combustion zone, perfect and\r\neconomical combustion of coal could not be effected.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively short length of the sixty-foot kiln not only limited\r\nthe amount of material that could be fed into it, but the limitation in\r\nlength of the combustion zone militated against a thorough clinkering of\r\nthe material, this operation being one in which the elements of time and\r\nproper heat are prime considerations. Thus the quantity of good clinker\r\nobtainable was unfavorably affected. By reason of these and other\r\nlimitations and losses, it had been possible, in practice, to obtain\r\nonly about two hundred and fifty barrels of clinker per day of\r\ntwenty-four hours; and that with an expenditure for coal proportionately\r\nequal to about 29 to 33 per cent. of the quantity of clinker produced,\r\neven assuming that all the clinker was of good quality.\r\n\r\nEdison realized that the secret of greater commercial efficiency and\r\nimprovement of quality lay in the ability to handle larger quantities\r\nof material within a given time, and to produce a more perfect product\r\nwithout increasing cost or investment in proportion. His reasoning led\r\nhim to the conclusion that this result could only be obtained through\r\nthe use of a kiln of comparatively great length, and his investigations\r\nand experiments enabled him to decide upon a length of one hundred and\r\nfifty feet, but with an increase in diameter of only six inches to a\r\nfoot over that of the sixty-foot kiln.\r\n\r\nThe principal considerations that influenced Edison in making this\r\nradical innovation may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst. The ability to maintain in the kiln a load from five to seven\r\ntimes greater than ordinarily employed, thereby tending to a more\r\neconomical output.\r\n\r\nSecond. The combustion of a vastly increased bulk of pulverized coal\r\nand a greatly enlarged combustion zone, extending about forty feet\r\nlongitudinally into the kiln--thus providing an area within which\r\nthe material might be maintained in a clinkering temperature for a\r\nsufficiently long period to insure its being thoroughly clinkered from\r\nperiphery to centre.\r\n\r\nThird. By reason of such a greatly extended length of the zone of\r\noncoming material (and consequently much greater bulk), the gases and\r\nother products of combustion would be cooled sufficiently between the\r\ncombustion zone and the stack so as to leave the kiln at a comparatively\r\nlow temperature. Besides, the oncoming material would thus be gradually\r\nraised in temperature instead of being heated abruptly, as in the\r\nshorter kilns.\r\n\r\nFourth. The material having thus been greatly raised in temperature\r\nbefore reaching the combustion zone would have parted with substantially\r\nall its carbon dioxide, and therefore would not introduce into the\r\ncombustion zone sufficient of that gas to disturb the perfect character\r\nof the combustion.\r\n\r\nFifth. On account of the great weight of the heavy load in a long kiln,\r\nthere would result the formation of a continuous plastic coating on that\r\nportion of the inner surface of the kiln where temperatures are\r\nhighest. This would effectively protect the fire-brick lining from the\r\ndestructive effects of the heat.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, were the essential principles upon which Edison based\r\nhis conception and invention of the long kiln, which has since become so\r\nwell known in the cement business.\r\n\r\nMany other considerations of a minor and mechanical nature, but which\r\nwere important factors in his solution of this difficult problem, are\r\nworthy of study by those intimately associated with or interested in the\r\nart. Not the least of the mechanical questions was settled by Edison's\r\ndecision to make this tremendously long kiln in sections of cast-iron,\r\nwith flanges, bolted together, and supported on rollers rotated by\r\nelectric motors. Longitudinal expansion and thrust were also important\r\nfactors to be provided for, as well as special devices to prevent the\r\npacking of the mass of material as it passed in and out of the kiln.\r\nSpecial provision was also made for injecting streams of pulverized coal\r\nin such manner as to create the largely extended zone of combustion. As\r\nto the details of these and many other ingenious devices, we must refer\r\nthe curious reader to the patents, as it is merely intended in these\r\npages to indicate in a brief manner the main principles of Edison's\r\nnotable inventions. The principal United States patent on the long kiln\r\nwas issued October 24, 1905, No. 802,631.\r\n\r\nThat his reasonings and deductions were correct in this case have been\r\nindubitably proven by some years of experience with the long kiln in its\r\nability to produce from eight hundred to one thousand barrels of\r\ngood clinker every twenty-four hours, with an expenditure for coal\r\nproportionately equal to about only 20 per cent. of the quantity of\r\nclinker produced.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the long cement kiln by diagram would convey but little\r\nto the lay mind, and we therefore present an illustration (Fig. 1) of\r\nactual kilns in perspective, from which sense of their proportions may\r\nbe gathered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. EDISON'S NEW STORAGE BATTERY\r\n\r\nGENERICALLY considered, a \"battery\" is a device which generates electric\r\ncurrent. There are two distinct species of battery, one being known as\r\n\"primary,\" and the other as \"storage,\" although the latter is sometimes\r\nreferred to as a \"secondary battery\" or \"accumulator.\" Every type of\r\neach of these two species is essentially alike in its general make-up;\r\nthat is to say, every cell of battery of any kind contains at least\r\ntwo elements of different nature immersed in a more or less liquid\r\nelectrolyte of chemical character. On closing the circuit of a primary\r\nbattery an electric current is generated by reason of the chemical\r\naction which is set up between the electrolyte and the elements.\r\nThis involves a gradual consumption of one of the elements and a\r\ncorresponding exhaustion of the active properties of the electrolyte. By\r\nreason of this, both the element and the electrolyte that have been used\r\nup must be renewed from time to time, in order to obtain a continued\r\nsupply of electric current.\r\n\r\nThe storage battery also generates electric current through chemical\r\naction, but without involving the constant repriming with active\r\nmaterials to replace those consumed and exhausted as above mentioned.\r\nThe term \"storage,\" as applied to this species of battery, is,\r\nhowever, a misnomer, and has been the cause of much misunderstanding\r\nto nontechnical persons. To the lay mind a \"storage\" battery presents\r\nitself in the aspect of a device in which electric energy is STORED,\r\njust as compressed air is stored or accumulated in a tank. This view,\r\nhowever, is not in accordance with facts. It is exactly like the primary\r\nbattery in the fundamental circumstance that its ability for generating\r\nelectric current depends upon chemical action. In strict terminology it\r\nis a \"reversible\" battery, as will be quite obvious if we glance briefly\r\nat its philosophy. When a storage battery is \"charged,\" by having an\r\nelectric current passed through it, the electric energy produces a\r\nchemical effect, adding oxygen to the positive plate, and taking oxygen\r\naway from the negative plate. Thus, the positive plate becomes oxidized,\r\nand the negative plate reduced. After the charging operation is\r\nconcluded the battery is ready for use, and upon its circuit being\r\nclosed through a translating device, such as a lamp or motor, a\r\nreversion (\"discharge\") takes place, the positive plate giving up its\r\noxygen, and the negative plate being oxidized. These chemical actions\r\nresult in the generation of an electric current as in a primary battery.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the chemical actions and reactions in a storage\r\nbattery are much more complex, but the above will serve to afford the\r\nlay reader a rather simple idea of the general result arrived at through\r\nthe chemical activity referred to.\r\n\r\nThe storage battery, as a commercial article, was introduced into the\r\nmarket in the year 1881. At that time, and all through the succeeding\r\nyears, until about 1905, there was only one type that was recognized as\r\ncommercially practicable--namely, that known as the lead-sulphuric-acid\r\ncell, consisting of lead plates immersed in an electrolyte of dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. In the year last named Edison first brought out his new\r\nform of nickel-iron cell with alkaline electrolyte, as we have related\r\nin the preceding narrative. Early in the eighties, at Menlo Park, he had\r\ngiven much thought to the lead type of storage battery, and during the\r\ncourse of three years had made a prodigious number of experiments in the\r\ndirection of improving it, probably performing more experiments in that\r\ntime than the aggregate of those of all other investigators. Even\r\nin those early days he arrived at the conclusion that the\r\nlead-sulphuric-acid combination was intrinsically wrong, and did not\r\nembrace the elements of a permanent commercial device. He did not at\r\nthat time, however, engage in a serious search for another form of\r\nstorage battery, being tremendously occupied with his lighting system\r\nand other matters.\r\n\r\nIt may here be noted, for the information of the lay reader, that the\r\nlead-acid type of storage battery consists of two or more lead plates\r\nimmersed in dilute sulphuric acid and contained in a receptacle of\r\nglass, hard rubber, or other special material not acted upon by acid.\r\nThe plates are prepared and \"formed\" in various ways, and the chemical\r\nactions are similar to those above stated, the positive plate being\r\noxidized and the negative reduced during \"charge,\" and reversed during\r\n\"discharge.\" This type of cell, however, has many serious disadvantages\r\ninherent to its very nature. We will name a few of them briefly.\r\nConstant dropping of fine particles of active material often causes\r\nshort-circuiting of the plates, and always necessitates occasional\r\nwashing out of cells; deterioration through \"sulphation\" if discharge\r\nis continued too far or if recharging is not commenced quickly enough;\r\ndestruction of adjacent metalwork by the corrosive fumes given out\r\nduring charge and discharge; the tendency of lead plates to \"buckle\"\r\nunder certain conditions; the limitation to the use of glass, hard\r\nrubber, or similar containers on account of the action of the acid; and\r\nthe immense weight for electrical capacity. The tremendously complex\r\nnature of the chemical reactions which take place in the lead-acid\r\nstorage battery also renders it an easy prey to many troublesome\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1900, when Edison undertook to invent a storage battery, he\r\ndeclared it should be a new type into which neither sulphuric nor\r\nany other acid should enter. He said that the intimate and continued\r\ncompanionship of an acid and a metal was unnatural, and incompatible\r\nwith the idea of durability and simplicity. He furthermore stated that\r\nlead was an unmechanical metal for a battery, being heavy and lacking\r\nstability and elasticity, and that as most metals were unaffected by\r\nalkaline solutions, he was going to experiment in that direction. The\r\nsoundness of his reasoning is amply justified by the perfection of\r\nresults obtained in the new type of storage battery bearing his name,\r\nand now to be described.\r\n\r\nThe essential technical details of this battery are fully described\r\nin an article written by one of Edison's laboratory staff, Walter\r\nE. Holland, who for many years has been closely identified with the\r\ninventor's work on this cell The article was published in the Electrical\r\nWorld, New York, April 28, 1910; and the following extracts therefrom\r\nwill afford an intelligent comprehension of this invention:\r\n\r\n\"The 'A' type Edison cell is the outcome of nine years of costly\r\nexperimentation and persistent toil on the part of its inventor and his\r\nassociates....\r\n\r\n\"The Edison invention involves the use of an entirely new\r\nvoltaic combination in an alkaline electrolyte, in place of the\r\nlead-lead-peroxide combination and acid electrolyte, characteristic of\r\nall other commercial storage batteries. Experience has proven that\r\nthis not only secures durability and greater output per unit-weight of\r\nbattery, but in addition there is eliminated a long list of troubles and\r\ndiseases inherent in the lead-acid combination....\r\n\r\n\"The principle on which the action of this new battery is based is\r\nthe oxidation and reduction of metals in an electrolyte which does not\r\ncombine with, and will not dissolve, either the metals or their oxides;\r\nand an electrolyte, furthermore, which, although decomposed by the\r\naction of the battery, is immediately re-formed in equal quantity; and\r\ntherefore in effect is a CONSTANT element, not changing in density or in\r\nconductivity.\r\n\r\n\"A battery embodying this basic principle will have features of great\r\nvalue where lightness and durability are desiderata. For instance, the\r\nelectrolyte, being a constant factor, as explained, is not required in\r\nany fixed and large amount, as is the case with sulphuric acid in the\r\nlead battery; thus the cell may be designed with minimum distancing of\r\nplates and with the greatest economy of space that is consistent with\r\nsafe insulation and good mechanical design. Again, the active materials\r\nof the electrodes being insoluble in, and absolutely unaffected by, the\r\nelectrolyte, are not liable to any sort of chemical deterioration by\r\naction of the electrolyte--no matter how long continued....\r\n\r\n\"The electrolyte of the Edison battery is a 21 per cent. solution of\r\npotassium hydrate having, in addition, a small amount of lithium\r\nhydrate. The active metals of the electrodes--which will oxidize and\r\nreduce in this electrolyte without dissolution or chemical\r\ndeterioration--are nickel and iron. These active elements are not put in\r\nthe plates AS METALS; but one, nickel, in the form of a hydrate, and the\r\nother, iron, as an oxide.\r\n\r\n\"The containing cases of both kinds of active material (Fig. 1), and\r\ntheir supporting grids (Fig. 2), as well as the bolts, washers, and nuts\r\nused in assembling (Fig. 3), and even the retaining can and its cover\r\n(Fig. 4), are all made of nickel-plated steel--a material in which\r\nlightness, durability and mechanical strength are most happily\r\ncombined, and a material beyond suspicion as to corrosion in an alkaline\r\nelectrolyte....\r\n\r\n\"An essential part of Edison's discovery of active masetials for\r\nan alkaline storage battery was the PREPARATION of these materials.\r\nMetallic powder of iron and nickel, or even oxides of these metals,\r\nprepared in the ordinary way, are not chemically active in a sufficient\r\ndegree to work in a battery. It is only when specially prepared iron\r\noxide of exceeding fineness, and nickel hydrate conforming to certain\r\nphysical, as well as chemical, standards can be made that the alkaline\r\nbattery is practicable. Needless to say, the working out of the\r\nconditions and processes of manufacture of the materials has involved\r\ngreat ingenuity and endless experimentation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe article then treats of Edison's investigations into means for\r\nsupporting and making electrical connection with the active materials,\r\nshowing some of the difficulties encountered and the various discoveries\r\nmade in developing the perfected cell, after which the writer continues\r\nhis description of the \"A\" type cell, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen at once that the construction of the two kinds of plate\r\nis radically different. The negative or iron plate (Fig. 5) has the\r\nfamiliar flat-pocket construction. Each negative contains twenty-four\r\npockets--a pocket being 1/2 inch wide by 3 inches long, and having a\r\nmaximum thickness of a little more than 1/8 inch. The positive or nickel\r\nplate (Fig. 6) is seen to consist of two rows of round rods or pencils,\r\nthirty in number, held in a vertical position by a steel support-frame.\r\nThe pencils have flat flanges at the ends (formed by closing in the\r\nmetal case), by which they are supported and electrical connection is\r\nmade. The frame is slit at the inner horizontal edges, and then folded\r\nin such a way as to make individual clamping-jaws for each end-flange.\r\nThe clamping-in is done at great pressure, and the resultant plate has\r\ngreat rigidity and strength.\r\n\r\n\"The perforated tubes into which the nickel active material is loaded\r\nare made of nickel-plated steel of high quality. They are put together\r\nwith a double-lapped spiral seam to give expansion-resisting qualities,\r\nand as an additional precaution small metal rings are slipped on the\r\noutside. Each tube is 1/4 inch in diameter by 4 1/8 inches long, add has\r\neight of the reinforcing rings.\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen that the 'A' positive plate has been given the\r\ntheoretically best design to prevent expansion and overcome trouble from\r\nthat cause. Actual tests, long continued under very severe conditions,\r\nhave shown that the construction is right, and fulfils the most sanguine\r\nexpectations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Holland in his article then goes on to explain the development of\r\nthe nickel flakes as the conducting factor in the positive element, but\r\nas this has already been described in Chapter XXII, we shall pass on to\r\na later point, where he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An idea of the conditions inside a loaded tube can best be had by\r\nmicroscopic examination. Fig. 7 shows a magnified section of a regularly\r\nloaded tube which has been sawed lengthwise. The vertical bounding walls\r\nare edges of the perforated metal containing tube; the dark horizontal\r\nlines are layers of nickel flake, while the light-colored thicker layers\r\nrepresent the nickel hydrate. It should be noted that the layers of\r\nflake nickel extend practically unbroken across the tube and make\r\ncontact with the metal wall at both sides. These metal layers conduct\r\ncurrent to or from the active nickel hydrate in all parts of the tube\r\nvery efficiently. There are about three hundred and fifty layers of\r\neach kind of material in a 4 1/8-inch tube, each layer of nickel hydrate\r\nbeing about 0.01 inch thick; so it will be seen that the current does\r\nnot have to penetrate very far into the nickel hydrate--one-half a\r\nlayer's thickness being the maximum distance. The perforations of\r\nthe containing tube, through which the electrolyte reaches the active\r\nmaterial, are also shown in Fig. 7.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the article enumerates the chief characteristics of the\r\nEdison storage battery which fit it preeminently for transportation\r\nservice, as follows: 1. No loss of active material, hence no\r\nsediment short-circuits. 2. No jar breakage. 3. Possibility of quick\r\ndisconnection or replacement of any cell without employment of skilled\r\nlabor. 4. Impossibility of \"buckling\" and harmlessness of a dead\r\nshort-circuit. 5. Simplicity of care required. 6. Durability of\r\nmaterials and construction. 7. Impossibility of \"sulphation.\" 8. Entire\r\nabsence of corrosive fumes. 9. Commercial advantages of light weight.\r\n10. Duration on account of its dependability. 11. Its high practical\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. EDISON'S POURED CEMENT HOUSE\r\n\r\nTHE inventions that have been thus far described fall into two\r\nclasses--first, those that were fundamental in the great arts and\r\nindustries which have been founded and established upon them, and,\r\nsecond, those that have entered into and enlarged other arts that were\r\npreviously in existence. On coming to consider the subject now under\r\ndiscussion, however, we find ourselves, at this writing, on the\r\nthreshold of an entirely new and undeveloped art of such boundless\r\npossibilities that its ultimate extent can only be a matter of\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nEdison's concrete house, however, involves two main considerations,\r\nfirst of which was the conception or creation of the IDEA--vast and\r\ncomprehensive--of providing imperishable and sanitary homes for\r\nthe wage-earner by molding an entire house in one piece in a single\r\noperation, so to speak, and so simply that extensive groups of such\r\ndwellings could be constructed rapidly and at very reasonable cost. With\r\nthis idea suggested, one might suppose that it would be a simple matter\r\nto make molds and pour in a concrete mixture. Not so, however. And here\r\nthe second consideration presents itself. An ordinary cement mixture is\r\ncomposed of crushed stone, sand, cement, and water. If such a mixture\r\nbe poured into deep molds the heavy stone and sand settle to the bottom.\r\nShould the mixture be poured into a horizontal mold, like the floor of\r\na house, the stone and sand settle, forming an ununiform mass. It was\r\nat this point that invention commenced, in order to produce a concrete\r\nmixture which would overcome this crucial difficulty. Edison, with\r\ncharacteristic thoroughness, took up a line of investigation, and after\r\na prolonged series of experiments succeeded in inventing a mixture that\r\nupon hardening remained uniform throughout its mass. In the beginning\r\nof his experimentation he had made the conditions of test very severe by\r\nthe construction of forms similar to that shown in the sketch below.\r\n\r\nThis consisted of a hollow wooden form of the dimensions indicated.\r\nThe mixture was to be poured into the hopper until the entire form was\r\nfilled, such mixture flowing down and along the horizontal legs and up\r\nthe vertical members. It was to be left until the mixture was hard, and\r\nthe requirement of the test was that there should be absolute uniformity\r\nof mixture and mass throughout. This was finally accomplished, and\r\nfurther invention then proceeded along engineering lines looking toward\r\nthe devising of a system of molds with which practicable dwellings might\r\nbe cast.\r\n\r\nEdison's boldness and breadth of conception are well illustrated in his\r\nidea of a poured house, in which he displays his accustomed tendency\r\nto reverse accepted methods. In fact, it is this very reversal of usual\r\nprocedure that renders it difficult for the average mind to instantly\r\ngrasp the full significance of the principles involved and the results\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nUp to this time we have been accustomed to see the erection of a house\r\nbegun at the foundation and built up slowly, piece by piece, of solid\r\nmaterials: first the outer frame, then the floors and inner walls,\r\nfollowed by the stairways, and so on up to the putting on of the roof.\r\nHence, it requires a complete rearrangement of mental conceptions to\r\nappreciate Edison's proposal to build a house FROM THE TOP DOWNWARD, in\r\na few hours, with a freely flowing material poured into molds, and in\r\na few days to take away the molds and find a complete indestructible\r\nsanitary house, including foundation, frame, floors, walls, stairways,\r\nchimneys, sanitary arrangements, and roof, with artistic ornamentation\r\ninside and out, all in one solid piece, as if it were graven or bored\r\nout of a rock.\r\n\r\nTo bring about the accomplishment of a project so extraordinarily broad\r\ninvolves engineering and mechanical conceptions of a high order, and, as\r\nwe have seen, these have been brought to bear on the subject by Edison,\r\ntogether with an intimate knowledge of compounded materials.\r\n\r\nThe main features of this invention are easily comprehensible with the\r\naid of the following diagrammatic sectional sketch:\r\n\r\nIt should be first understood that the above sketch is in broad outline,\r\nwithout elaboration, merely to illustrate the working principle; and\r\nwhile the upright structure on the right is intended to represent a\r\nset of molds in position to form a three-story house, with cellar, no\r\nregular details of such a building (such as windows, doors, stairways,\r\netc.) are here shown, as they would only tend to complicate an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that there are really two sets of molds, an inside and\r\nan outside set, leaving a space between them throughout. Although not\r\nshown in the sketch, there is in practice a number of bolts passing\r\nthrough these two sets of molds at various places to hold them together\r\nin their relative positions. In the open space between the molds there\r\nare placed steel rods for the purpose of reinforcement; while all\r\nthrough the entire structure provision is made for water and steam\r\npipes, gas-pipes and electric-light wires being placed in appropriate\r\npositions as the molds are assembled.\r\n\r\nAt the centre of the roof there will be noted a funnel-shaped opening.\r\nInto this there is delivered by the endless chain of buckets shown on\r\nthe left a continuous stream of a special free-flowing concrete mixture.\r\nThis mixture descends by gravity, and gradually fills the entire\r\nspace between the two sets of molds. The delivery of the material--or\r\n\"pouring,\" as it is called--is continued until every part of the\r\nspace is filled and the mixture is even with the tip of the roof,\r\nthus completing the pouring, or casting, of the house. In a few days\r\nafterward the concrete will have hardened sufficiently to allow the\r\nmolds to be taken away leaving an entire house, from cellar floor to the\r\npeak of the roof, complete in all its parts, even to mantels and picture\r\nmolding, and requiring only windows and doors, plumbing, heating, and\r\nlighting fixtures to make it ready for habitation.\r\n\r\nIn the above sketch the concrete mixers, A, B, are driven by the\r\nelectric motor, C. As the material is mixed it descends into the tank,\r\nD, and flows through a trough into a lower tank, E, in which it is\r\nconstantly stirred, and from which it is taken by the endless chain\r\nof buckets and dumped into the funnel-shaped opening at the top of the\r\nmolds, as above described.\r\n\r\nThe molds are made of cast-iron in sections of such size and weight as\r\nwill be most convenient for handling, mostly in pieces not exceeding two\r\nby four feet in rectangular dimensions. The subjoined sketch shows\r\nan exterior view of several of these molds as they appear when bolted\r\ntogether, the intersecting central portions representing ribs, which are\r\nincluded as part of the casting for purposes of strength and rigidity.\r\n\r\nThe molds represented above are those for straight work, such as walls\r\nand floors. Those intended for stairways, eaves, cornices, windows,\r\ndoorways, etc., are much more complicated in design, although the same\r\ngeneral principles are employed in their construction.\r\n\r\nWhile the philosophy of pouring or casting a complete house in its\r\nentirety is apparently quite simple, the development of the engineering\r\nand mechanical questions involves the solution of a vast number of most\r\nintricate and complicated problems covering not only the building as\r\na whole, but its numerous parts, down to the minutest detail. Safety,\r\nconvenience, duration, and the practical impossibility of altering\r\na one-piece solid dwelling are questions that must be met before its\r\nconstruction, and therefore Edison has proceeded calmly on his way\r\ntoward the goal he has ever had clearly in mind, with utter indifference\r\nto the criticisms and jeers of those who, as \"experts,\" have professed\r\npositive knowledge of the impossibility of his carrying out this daring\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF UNITED STATES PATENTS\r\n\r\nList of United States patents granted to Thomas A.
