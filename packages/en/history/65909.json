Footnotes for Tables I-XVI\r\n  have been kept at the bottom of each relevant Table.\r\n\r\n  Basic fractions are displayed as ½ ⅓ ¼ etc; other fractions are\r\n  mostly shown in the form a-b/c, for example 1/72 or 69-4/9. The\r\n  book also has some fractions in the form a-b, for example 1-40th or\r\n  7-100ths.\r\n\r\n  Each entry in the dictionary is a Latin name and uses vowel breves\r\n  and macrons to indicate pronunciation. Greek words in the text use\r\n  polytonic Greek.

The use\r\nof abaci was first introduced at Rome from Asia Minor after the\r\nvictories of Cn. Manlius Vulso, B.C. 187, and their introduction was\r\nregarded as one of the marks of the growing luxury of the age.--(2)\r\nA draught-board or chess-board.--(3) A board used by mathematicians\r\nfor drawing diagrams, and by arithmeticians for the purposes of\r\ncalculation.--(4) A painted panel, coffer, or square compartment in\r\nthe wall or ceiling of a chamber.--(5) In architecture, the flat\r\nsquare stone which constituted the highest member of a column, being\r\nplaced immediately under the architrave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abacus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLLA, a cloak chiefly worn by soldiers, and thus opposed to the\r\ntoga, the garb of peace. [TOGA.] The abolla was used by the lower\r\nclasses at Rome, and consequently by the philosophers who affected\r\nseverity of manners and life. Hence the expression of Juvenal,\r\n_facinus majoris abollae_,--“a crime committed by a very deep\r\nphilosopher.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abolla. (Bellori, Arc. Triumph., pl. 11, 12.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nABRŎGĀTĬO. [LEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nABSŎLŪTĬO. [JUDEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂCAENA (ἀκαίνη, ἄκαινα, or in later Greek ἄκενα, in one place\r\nἄκαινον), a measuring rod of the length of ten Greek feet. It was\r\nused in measuring land, and thus resembles the Roman decempeda.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂCATĬUM (ἀκάτιον, a diminutive of ἄκατος), a small vessel or boat\r\nused by the Greeks, which appears to have been the same as the Roman\r\n_scapha_. The _Acatia_ were also sails adapted for fast sailing.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCENSUS. (1) A public officer, who attended on several of the Roman\r\nmagistrates. The Accensi summoned the people to the assemblies,\r\nand those who had law-suits to court; they preserved order in the\r\ncourts, and proclaimed the time of the day when it was the third\r\nhour, the sixth hour, and the ninth hour. An accensus anciently\r\npreceded the consul who had not the fasces, which custom, after being\r\nlong disused, was restored by Julius Cæsar in his first consulship.\r\nAccensi also attended on the governors of provinces.--(2) The accensi\r\nwere also a class of soldiers in the Roman army, who were enlisted\r\nafter the full number of the legion had been completed, in order to\r\nsupply any vacancies that might occur in the legion. They were taken,\r\naccording to the census of Servius Tullius, from the fifth class of\r\ncitizens, and were placed in battle in the rear of the army, behind\r\nthe triarii.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCLĀMĀTĬO, was the public expression of approbation or\r\ndisapprobation, pleasure or displeasure, by loud acclamations.\r\nOn many occasions, there appear to have been certain forms of\r\nacclamations always used by the Romans; as, for instance, at\r\nmarriages, _Io Hymen_, _Hymenaee_, or _Talassio_; at triumphs,\r\n_Io Triumphe_; at the conclusion of plays, the last actor called\r\nout _Plaudite_ to the spectators; orators were usually praised by\r\nsuch expressions as _Bene et praeclare_, _Belle et festive_, _Non\r\npotest melius_, &c. Under the empire the name of _acclamationes_ was\r\ngiven to the praises and flatteries bestowed by the senate upon the\r\nreigning emperor and his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCŬBĀTĬO, the act of reclining at meals. The Greeks and Romans were\r\naccustomed, in later times, to recline at their meals; but this\r\npractice could not have been of great antiquity in Greece, since\r\nHomer always describes persons as sitting at their meals; and Isidore\r\nof Seville, an ancient grammarian, also attributes the same custom\r\nto the ancient Romans. Even in the time of the early Roman emperors,\r\nchildren in families of the highest rank used to sit together, while\r\ntheir fathers and elders reclined on couches at the upper part of the\r\nroom. Roman ladies continued the practice of sitting at table, even\r\nafter the recumbent position had become common with the other sex.\r\nIt appears to have been considered more decent, and more agreeable\r\nto the severity and purity of ancient manners, for women to sit,\r\nmore especially if many persons were present. But, on the other\r\nhand, we find cases of women reclining, where there was conceived\r\nto be nothing bold or indelicate in their posture. Such is the case\r\nin the preceding woodcut, which seems intended to represent a scene\r\nof matrimonial felicity. For an account of the disposition of the\r\ncouches, and of the place which each guest occupied in a Greek and\r\nRoman entertainment, see SYMPOSIUM and TRICLINIUM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Accubatio. Act of Reclining. (Montfaucon, Ant. Exp.,\r\nSuppl., iii. 60.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nACCŪSĀTOR, ACCŪSĀTIO. [JUDEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂCERRA (θυμιατήριον, λιβανωτρίς), the incense-box or censer used\r\nin sacrifices. The acerra was also a small moveable altar placed\r\nbefore the dead, on which perfumes were burnt. The use of acerrae\r\nat funerals was forbidden by a law of the Twelve Tables as an\r\nunnecessary expense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Acerra. (From a Frieze in the Museum Capitolinum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂCĒTABŬLUM (ὀξίς, ὀξύβαφον, ὀξυβάφιον). (1) A vinegar-cup, wide and\r\nopen above, as we see in the annexed cut. The name was also given to\r\nall cups resembling it in size and form, to whatever use they might\r\nbe applied.--(2) A Roman measure of capacity, fluid and dry. It was\r\none-fourth of the hemian, and therefore one-eighth of the sextarius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Acetabulum. (Dennis, Etruria, p. xcvi.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂCHĀĬCUM FOEDUS. The Achaean league is divided into two periods.\r\n1. _The earlier period._--When the Heracleidae took possession\r\nof Peloponnesus, which had until then been chiefly inhabited\r\nby Achaeans, a portion of the latter, under Tisamenus, turned\r\nnorthwards and occupied the north coast of Peloponnesus. The country\r\nthus occupied derived from them its name of Achaia, and contained\r\ntwelve confederate towns, which were governed by the descendants\r\nof Tisamenus, till at length they abolished the kingly rule after\r\nthe death of Ogyges, and established a democracy. In the time of\r\nHerodotus the twelve towns of which the league consisted were:\r\nPellene, Aegeira, Aegae, Bura, Helice, Aegium, Rhypes (Rhypae),\r\nPatreis (ae), Phareis (ae), Olenus, Dyme, and Tritaeeis (Tritaea).\r\nAfter the time of Herodotus, Rhypes and Aegae disappeared from the\r\nnumber, and Ceryneia and Leontium stepped into their place. The bond\r\nwhich united the towns of the league was not so much a political\r\nas a religious one, as is shown by the common sacrifice offered\r\nat Helice to Poseidon, and after the destruction of that town, at\r\nAegium to Zeus, surnamed Homagyrius, and to Demeter Panachaea. The\r\nconfederation exercised no great influence in the affairs of Greece\r\ndown to the time when it was broken up by the Macedonians. 2. _The\r\nlater period._--When Antigonus in B.C. 281 made the unsuccessful\r\nattempt to deprive Ptolemaeus Ceraunus of the Macedonian throne,\r\nthe Achaeans availed themselves of the opportunity of shaking off\r\nthe Macedonian yoke, and renewing their ancient confederation. The\r\ngrand object however now was no longer a common worship, but a\r\nreal political union among the confederates. The fundamental laws\r\nwere, that henceforth the confederacy should form one inseparable\r\nstate, that each town, which should join it, should have equal\r\nrights with the others, and that all members, in regard to foreign\r\ncountries, should be considered as dependent, and bound to obey in\r\nevery respect the federal government, and those officers who were\r\nentrusted with the executive. Aegium was the seat of the government,\r\nand it was there that the citizens of the various towns met at\r\nregular and stated times, to deliberate upon the common affairs of\r\nthe league, and if it was thought necessary, upon those of separate\r\ntowns, and even of individuals, and to elect the officers of the\r\nleague. The league acquired its great strength in B.C. 251, when\r\nAratus united Sicyon, his native place, with it, and some years\r\nlater gained Corinth also for it. Megara, Troezene, and Epidaurus\r\nsoon followed their example. Afterwards Aratus persuaded all the\r\nmore important towns of Peloponnesus to join the confederacy, and\r\nthus Megalopolis, Argos, Hermione, Phlius, and others were added to\r\nit. In a short period the league reached the height of its power,\r\nfor it embraced Athens, Megara, Aegina, Salamis, and the whole of\r\nPeloponnesus, with the exception of Sparta, Elis, Tegea, Orchomenos,\r\nand Mantineia. The common affairs of the confederate towns were\r\nregulated at general meetings attended by the citizens of all the\r\ntowns, and held regularly twice every year, in the spring and in\r\nthe autumn. These meetings, which lasted three days, were held in a\r\ngrove of Zeus Homagyrius in the neighbourhood of Aegium, and near a\r\nsanctuary of Demeter Panachaea. Every citizen, both rich and poor,\r\nwho had attained the age of thirty, might attend the assemblies,\r\nto which they were invited by a public herald, and might speak and\r\npropose any measure. The subjects which were to be brought before\r\nthe assembly were prepared by a council (βουλή), which seems to have\r\nbeen permanent. The principal officers of the confederacy were:\r\n1. At first two strategi (στρατηγοί), but after the year B.C. 255\r\nthere was only one, who in conjunction with an hipparchus (ἴππαρχος)\r\nor commander of the cavalry and an under-strategus (ὑποστρατηγός)\r\ncommanded the army furnished by the confederacy, and was entrusted\r\nwith the whole conduct of war; 2. A public secretary (γραμματεύς);\r\nand, 3. Ten demiurgi (δημιουργοί). All the officers of the league\r\nwere elected in the assembly held in the spring, at the rising of\r\nthe Pleiades, and legally they were invested with their several\r\noffices only for one year, though it frequently happened that men of\r\ngreat merit and distinction were re-elected for several successive\r\nyears. If one of the officers died during the period of his office,\r\nhis place was filled by his predecessor, until the time for the\r\nnew elections arrived. The perpetual discord of the members of the\r\nleague, the hostility of Sparta, the intrigues of the Romans, and the\r\nfolly and rashness of the later strategi, brought about not only the\r\ndestruction and dissolution of the confederacy, but of the freedom of\r\nall Greece, which after the fall of Corinth, in B.C. 146, became a\r\nRoman province under the name of Achaia.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂCĬES. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂCĪNĂCĒS (ἀκινάκης), a Persian sword, whence Horace speaks of the\r\n_Medus acinaces_. The acinaces was a short and straight weapon, and\r\nthus differed from the Roman _sica_, which was curved. It was worn on\r\nthe right side of the body, whereas the Greeks and Romans usually had\r\ntheir swords suspended on the left side. The form of the acinaces,\r\nwith the mode of wearing it, is illustrated by the following\r\nPersepolitan figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Acinaces, Persian Sword. (From bas-reliefs at\r\nPersepolis.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nACISCŬLUS. [ASCIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĀCLIS, a kind of dart with a leathern thong attached to it. [AMENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nACROĀMA (ἀκρόαμα), which properly means any thing heard, was the name\r\ngiven to a concert of players on different musical instruments, and\r\nalso to an interlude performed during the exhibition of the public\r\ngames. The word is also applied to the actors and musicians who were\r\nemployed to amuse guests during an entertainment, and is sometimes\r\nused to designate the anagnostae. [ANAGNOSTES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nACRŎLĬTHI (ἀκρόλιθοι), statues, of which the extremities only were\r\nof marble, and the remaining part of the body of wood either gilt or\r\ncovered with drapery.\r\n\r\n\r\nACRŎPŎLIS (ἀκρόπολις). In almost all Greek states, which were\r\nusually built upon a hill, rock, or some natural elevation, there\r\nwas a castle or a citadel, erected upon the highest part of the rock\r\nor hill, to which the name of _Acropolis_, higher or upper city,\r\nwas given. Thus we read of an acropolis at Athens, Corinth, Argos,\r\nMessene, and many other places. The Capitolium at Rome answered the\r\nsame purpose as the Acropolis in the Greek cities; and of the same\r\nkind were the tower of Agathocles at Utica, and that of Antonia at\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSTŎLĬUM. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nACRŎTĒRĬUM (ἀκρωτήριον), signifies the extremity of any thing, and\r\nwas applied by the Greeks to the extremities of the prow of a vessel\r\n(ἀκροστόλιον), which were usually taken from a conquered vessel as\r\na mark of victory: the act of doing so was called ἀκρωτηριάζειν. In\r\narchitecture it signifies, 1. The sloping roof of a building. 2. The\r\npediment. 3. The pedestals for statues placed on the summit of a\r\npediment. In sculpture it signifies the extremities of a statue, as\r\nwings, feet, hands, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTA. (1) The public acts and orders of a Roman magistrate, which\r\nafter the expiration of his office were submitted to the senate for\r\napproval or rejection. Under the empire, all the magistrates when\r\nentering upon their office on the 1st of January swore approval of\r\nthe acts of the reigning emperor.--(2) ACTA FORENSIA were of two\r\nkinds: first, those relating to the government, as leges, plebiscita,\r\nedicta, the names of all the magistrates, &c., which formed part of\r\nthe _tabulae publicae_; and secondly, those connected with the courts\r\nof law.--(3) ACTA MILITARIA, contained an account of the duties,\r\nnumbers, and expenses of each legion, and were probably preserved\r\nin the military treasury founded by Augustus.--(4) ACTA SENATUS,\r\ncalled also COMMENTARII SENATUS and ACTA PATRUM, contained an account\r\nof the various matters brought before the senate, the opinions of\r\nthe chief speakers, and the decision of the house. By command of\r\nJulius Caesar they were published regularly every day as part of\r\nthe government gazette. Augustus forbade the publication of the\r\nproceedings of the senate, but they still continued to be preserved,\r\nand one of the most distinguished senators was chosen by the emperor\r\nto compile the account.--(5) ACTA DIURNA, a gazette published daily\r\nat Rome by the authority of the government, during the later times\r\nof the republic and under the empire, corresponding in some measure\r\nto our newspapers. They were also called _Acta Publica_, _Acta\r\nUrbana_, _Acta Rerum Urbanarum_, _Acta Populi_, and sometimes simply\r\n_Acta_ or _Diurna_. They contained, 1. A list of births and deaths\r\nin the city, an account of the money paid into the treasury from\r\nthe provinces, and every thing relating to the supply of corn. 2.\r\nExtracts from the Acta Forensia. 3. Extracts from the Acta Senatus.\r\n4. A court circular, containing an account of the births, deaths,\r\nfestivals, and movements of the imperial family. 5. An account of\r\nsuch public affairs and foreign wars as the government thought proper\r\nto publish. 6. Curious and interesting occurrences, such as prodigies\r\nand miracles, the erection of new edifices, the conflagration of\r\nbuildings, funerals, sacrifices, a list of the various games, and\r\nespecially curious tales and adventures, with the names of the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTĬA (ἄκτια), a festival celebrated every four years at Actium in\r\nEpirus, with wrestling, horse-racing, and sea-fights, in honour of\r\nApollo. There was a celebrated temple of Apollo at Actium. After\r\nthe defeat of Antony off Actium, Augustus enlarged the temple, and\r\ninstituted games to be celebrated every five years in commemoration\r\nof his victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTĬO, is defined by a Roman jurist to be the right of pursuing by\r\njudicial means what is a man’s due. The old actions of the Roman\r\nlaw were called _legis actiones_ or _legitimae_, either because\r\nthey were expressly provided for by the laws of the Twelve Tables,\r\nor because they were strictly adapted to the words of the laws, and\r\ntherefore could not be varied. But these forms of action gradually\r\nfell into disuse, in consequence of the excessive nicety required,\r\nand the failure consequent on the slightest error in the pleadings,\r\nand they were eventually abolished by the Lex Aebutia, and two Leges\r\nJuliae, except in a few cases. In the old Roman constitution, the\r\nknowledge of the law was most closely connected with the institutes\r\nand ceremonial of religion, and was accordingly in the hands of\r\nthe patricians alone, whose aid their clients were obliged to ask\r\nin all their legal disputes. App. Claudius Caecus, perhaps one of\r\nthe earliest writers on law, drew up the various forms of actions,\r\nprobably for his own use and that of his friends: the manuscript was\r\nstolen or copied by his scribe Cn. Flavius, who made it public; and\r\nthus, according to the story, the plebeians became acquainted with\r\nthose legal forms which hitherto had been the exclusive property of\r\nthe patricians. After the abolition of the old legal actions, a suit\r\nwas prosecuted in the following manner:--An action was commenced by\r\nthe plaintiff summoning the defendant to appear before the praetor\r\nor other magistrate who had _jurisdictio_; this process was called\r\n_in jus vocatio_; and, according to the laws of the Twelve Tables,\r\nwas in effect a dragging of the defendant before the praetor, if\r\nhe refused to go quietly; and although this rude proceeding was\r\nsomewhat modified in later times, we find in the time of Horace\r\nthat if the defendant would not go quietly, the plaintiff called on\r\nany bystander to witness, and dragged the defendant into court. The\r\nparties might settle their dispute on their way to the court, or\r\nthe defendant might be bailed by a vindex. The vindex must not be\r\nconfounded with the vades. This settlement of disputes on the way\r\nwas called _transactio in via_, and serves to explain a passage in\r\nSt. Matthew, v. 25. When before the praetor, the parties were said\r\n_jure agere_. The plaintiff then prayed for an action, and if the\r\npraetor allowed it (_dabat actionem_), he then declared what action\r\nhe intended to bring against the defendant, which he called _edere\r\nactionem_. This might be done in writing, or orally, or by the\r\nplaintiff taking the defendant to the _album_ [ALBUM], and showing\r\nhim which action he intended to rely on. As the _formulae_ on the\r\nalbum comprehended, or were supposed to comprehend, every possible\r\nform of action that could be required by a plaintiff, it was presumed\r\nthat he could find among all the formulae some one which was adapted\r\nto his case; and he was, accordingly, supposed to be without excuse\r\nif he did not take pains to select the proper formula. If he took\r\nthe wrong one, or if he claimed more than his due, he lost his cause\r\n(_causa cadebat_); but the praetor sometimes gave him leave to amend\r\nhis claim or _intentio_. It will be observed, that as the formulae\r\nwere so numerous and comprehensive, the plaintiff had only to select\r\nthe formula which he supposed to be suitable to his case, and it\r\nwould require no further variation than the insertion of the names\r\nof the parties and of the thing claimed, or the subject-matter of\r\nthe suit, with the amount of damages, &c., as the case might be.\r\nWhen the praetor had granted an action, the plaintiff required the\r\ndefendant to give security for his appearance before the praetor\r\n(_in jure_) on a day named, commonly the day but one after the _in\r\njus vocatio_, unless the matter in dispute was settled at once. The\r\ndefendant, on finding a surety, was said _vades dare_, _vadimonium\r\npromittere_, or _facere_; the surety, _vas_, was said _spondere_;\r\nthe plaintiff, when satisfied with the surety, was said _vadari\r\nreum_, to let him go on his sureties, or to have sureties from him.\r\nWhen the defendant promised to appear _in jure_ on the day named,\r\nwithout giving any surety, this was called _vadimonium purum_. In\r\nsome cases, _recuperatores_ [JUDEX] were named, who, in case of the\r\ndefendant making default, condemned him in the sum of money named in\r\nthe _vadimonium_. If the defendant appeared on the day appointed,\r\nhe was said _vadimonium sistere_; if he did not appear, he was said\r\n_vadimonium deseruisse_; and the praetor gave to the plaintiff\r\nthe _bonorum possessio_. Both parties, on the day appointed, were\r\nsummoned by a crier (_praeco_), when the plaintiff made his claim\r\nor demand, which was very briefly expressed, and may be considered\r\nas corresponding to our declaration at law. The defendant might\r\neither deny the plaintiff’s claim, or he might reply to it by a\r\nplea, _exceptio_. If he simply denied the plaintiff’s claim, the\r\ncause was at issue, and a judex might be demanded. The forms of the\r\n_exceptio_, also, were contained in the praetor’s edict, or, upon\r\nhearing the facts, the praetor adapted the plea to the case. The\r\nplaintiff might reply to the defendant’s _exceptio_. The plaintiff’s\r\nanswer was called _replicatio_. If the defendant answered the\r\n_replicatio_, his answer was called _duplicatio_; and the parties\r\nmight go on to the _triplicatio_ and _quadruplicatio_, and even\r\nfurther, if the matters in question were such that they could not\r\notherwise be brought to an issue. A person might maintain or defend\r\nan action by his _cognitor_ or _procurator_, or, as we should say,\r\nby his attorney. The plaintiff and defendant used a certain form\r\nof words in appointing a cognitor, and it would appear that the\r\nappointment was made in the presence of both parties. The cognitor\r\nneeded not to be present, and his appointment was complete when by\r\nhis acts he had signified his assent. When the cause was brought to\r\nan issue, a judex or judices might be demanded of the praetor, who\r\nnamed or appointed a judex, and delivered to him the formula, which\r\ncontained his instructions. The judices were said _dari_ or _addici_.\r\nSo far the proceedings were said to be _in jure_: the prosecution of\r\nthe actio before the judex requires a separate discussion. [JUDEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nACTOR, signified generally a plaintiff. In a civil or private action,\r\nthe plaintiff was often called _petitor_; in a public action (_causa\r\npublica_), he was called _accusator_. The defendant was called\r\n_reus_, both in private and public causes: this term, however,\r\naccording to Cicero, might signify either party, as indeed we might\r\nconclude from the word itself. In a private action the defendant\r\nwas often called _adversarius_, but either party might be called\r\n_adversarius_ with respect to the other. Wards brought their actions\r\nby their guardian or tutor. _Peregrini_, or aliens, originally\r\nbrought their action through their patronus; but afterwards in their\r\nown name, by a fiction of law, that they were Roman citizens. A Roman\r\ncitizen might also generally bring his action by means of a cognitor\r\nor procurator. [ACTIO.] Actor has also the sense of an agent or\r\nmanager of another’s business generally. The _actor publicus_ was an\r\nofficer who had the superintendence or care of slaves and property\r\nbelonging to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTŬĀRĬAE NĀVES, transport-vessels, seem to have been built in a\r\nlighter style than the ordinary ships of burden, from which they also\r\ndiffered in being always furnished with oars, whereas the others were\r\nchiefly propelled by sails.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTŬĀRĬI, short-hand writers, who took down the speeches in the\r\nsenate and the public assemblies. In the debate in the Roman senate\r\nupon the punishment of those who had been concerned in the conspiracy\r\nof Catiline, we find the first mention of short-hand writers, who\r\nwere employed by Cicero to take down the speech of Cato.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTUS, a Roman measure of length, also called _actus quadratus_, was\r\nequal to half a jugerum, or 14,400 square Roman feet. The _actus\r\nminimus_, or _simplex_, was 120 feet long, and four broad, and\r\ntherefore equal to 480 square Roman feet. Actus was also used to\r\nsignify a bridle-way.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂCUS (βελόνη, βελονίς, ῥαφίς), a needle, a pin. Pins were made not\r\nonly of metal, but also of wood, bone, and ivory. They were used for\r\nthe same purposes as with us, and also in dressing the hair. The mode\r\nof platting the hair, and then fastening it with a pin or needle, is\r\nshown in the annexed figure of a female head. This fashion has been\r\ncontinued to our own times by the females of Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Acus. (Montfaucon, Ant. Exp., Suppl., iii. 8.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nADDICTI. [NEXI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nADFĪNES. [AFFINES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nADLECTI, or ALLECTI, those persons under the empire who were admitted\r\nto the privileges and honours of the praetorship, quaestorship,\r\naedileship, and other public offices, without having any duties to\r\nperform. The senators called _adlecti_ seem to have been the same as\r\nthe conscripti.\r\n\r\n\r\nADLŎCŪTĬO. [ALLOCUTIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSĬŌNĀLES, chamberlains at the imperial court, who introduced\r\npersons into the presence of the emperor. They were divided into\r\nfour classes; the chief officer of each class was called _proximus\r\nadmissionum_; and the proximi were under the _magister admissionum_.\r\nTheir duty was called _officium admissionis_. They were usually\r\nfreedmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂDŎLESCENS, was applied in the Roman law to a person from the end of\r\nhis twelfth or fourteenth to the end of his twenty-fifth year, during\r\nwhich period a person was also called _adultus_. The word adolescens,\r\nhowever, is frequently used in a less strict sense in the Latin\r\nwriters in referring to a person much older than the above-mentioned\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂDŌNĬA (ἀδώνια), a festival celebrated in honour of Aphrodite and\r\nAdonis in most of the Grecian cities. It lasted two days, and was\r\ncelebrated by women exclusively. On the first day they brought into\r\nthe streets statues of Adonis, which were laid out as corpses; and\r\nthey observed all the rites customary at funerals, beating themselves\r\nand uttering lamentations. The second day was spent in merriment and\r\nfeasting; because Adonis was allowed to return to life, and spend\r\nhalf the year with Aphrodite.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂDOPTĬO, adoption. (1) GREEK.--Adoption was called by the Athenians\r\nεἰσποίησις, or sometimes simply ποίησις, or θέσις. The adoptive\r\nfather was said ποιεῖσθαι, εἰσποιεῖσθαι, or sometimes ποιεῖν: and\r\nthe father or mother (for a mother after the death of her husband\r\ncould consent to her son being adopted) was said ἐκποιεῖν: the son\r\nwas said ἐκποιεῖσθαι with reference to the family which he left;\r\nand εἰσποιεῖσθαι with reference to the family into which he was\r\nreceived. The son, when adopted, was called ποιητός, εἰσποιητός, or\r\nθετός, in opposition to the legitimate son born of the body of the\r\nfather, who was called γνήσιος. A man might adopt a son either in\r\nhis lifetime or by his testament, provided he had no male offspring,\r\nand was of sound mind. He might also, by testament, name a person\r\nto take his property, in case his son or sons should die under\r\nage. Only Athenian citizens could be adopted; but females could be\r\nadopted (by testament at least) as well as males. The adopted child\r\nwas transferred from his own family and demus into those of the\r\nadoptive father; he inherited his property, and maintained the sacra\r\nof his adoptive father. It was not necessary for him to take his\r\nnew father’s name, but he was registered as his son in the register\r\nof his phratria (φρατρικὸν γραμματεῖον). Subsequently to this, it\r\nwas necessary to enter him in the register of the adoptive father’s\r\ndemus (ληξιαρχικὸν γραμματεῖον), without which registration it\r\nappears that he did not possess the full rights of citizenship as a\r\nmember of his new demus.--(2) ROMAN.--The Roman relation of parent\r\nand child arose either from a lawful marriage or from adoption.\r\n_Adoptio_ was the general name which comprehended the two species,\r\n_adoptio_ and _adrogatio_; and as the adopted person passed from\r\nhis own familia into that of the person adopting, _adoptio_ caused\r\na _capitis diminutio_, and the lowest of the three kinds. [CAPUT.]\r\nAdoption, in its specific sense, was the ceremony by which a person\r\nwho was in the power of his parent (_in potestate parentum_),\r\nwhether child or grandchild, male or female, was transferred to the\r\npower of the person adopting him. It was effected under the authority\r\nof a magistrate (_magistratus_), the praetor, for instance, at\r\nRome, or a governor (_praeses_) in the provinces. The person to be\r\nadopted was emancipated [MANCIPATIO] by his natural father before\r\nthe competent authority, and surrendered to the adoptive father by\r\nthe legal form called _in jure cessio_. When a person was not in\r\nthe power of his parent (_sui juris_), the ceremony of adoption was\r\ncalled _adrogatio_. Originally, it could only be effected at Rome,\r\nand only by a vote of the populus (_populi auctoritate_) in the\r\ncomitia curiata (_lege curiata_); the reason of this being that the\r\ncaput or status of a Roman citizen could not, according to the laws\r\nof the Twelve Tables, be effected except by a vote of the populus\r\nin the comitia curiata. Clodius, the enemy of Cicero, was adrogated\r\ninto a plebeian family, in order to qualify himself to be elected\r\na tribune of the plebs. Females could not be adopted by adrogatio.\r\nUnder the emperors it became the practice to effect the adrogatio by\r\nan imperial rescript. The effect of adoption was to create the legal\r\nrelation of father and son, just as if the adopted son were born of\r\nthe blood of the adoptive father in lawful marriage. The adopted\r\nchild was intitled to the name and sacra privata of the adopting\r\nparent. A person, on passing from one gens into another, and taking\r\nthe name of his new familia, generally retained the name of his old\r\ngens also, with the addition to it of the termination _anus_. Thus\r\nAemilius, the son of L. Aemilius Paullus, upon being adopted by P.\r\nCornelius Scipio, assumed the name of P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus,\r\nand C. Octavius, afterwards the emperor Augustus, upon being adopted\r\nby the testament of his great-uncle the dictator, assumed the name of\r\nC. Julius Caesar Octavianus.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂDŌRĀTĬO (προσκύνησις), adoration, was paid to the gods in the\r\nfollowing manner:--The individual stretched out his right hand to the\r\nstatue of the god whom he wished to honour, then kissed his hand,\r\nand waved it to the statue. The adoratio differed from the _oratio_\r\nor prayers, which were offered with the hands folded together and\r\nstretched out to the gods. The adoration paid to the Roman emperors\r\nwas borrowed from the Eastern mode, and consisted in prostration on\r\nthe ground, and kissing the feet and knees of the emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nADRŎGĀTĬO. [ADOPTIO, (ROMAN).]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂDULTĔRĬUM, adultery. (1) GREEK.--Among the Athenians, if a man\r\ncaught another man in the act of criminal intercourse (μοιχεία)\r\nwith his wife, he might kill him with impunity; and the law was\r\nalso the same with respect to a concubine (παλλακή). He might also\r\ninflict other punishment on the offender. It appears that there was\r\nno adultery, unless a married woman was concerned. The husband might,\r\nif he pleased, take a sum of money from the adulterer, by way of\r\ncompensation, and detain him till he found sureties for the payment.\r\nThe husband might also prosecute the adulterer in the action called\r\nμοιχείας γραφή. If the act of adultery was proved, the husband could\r\nno longer cohabit with his wife, under pain of losing his privileges\r\nof a citizen (ἀτιμία). The adulteress was excluded even from those\r\ntemples which foreign women and slaves were allowed to enter; and if\r\nshe was seen there, any one might treat her as he pleased, provided\r\nhe did not kill her or mutilate her.--(2) ROMAN.--The word adulterium\r\nproperly signifies, in the Roman law, the offence committed by a\r\nman’s having sexual intercourse with another man’s wife. _Stuprum_\r\n(called by the Greeks φθορά) signifies the like offence with a widow\r\nor virgin. In the time of Augustus a law was enacted (probably about\r\nB.C. 17), entitled _Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis_, which seems\r\nto have contained special penal provisions against adultery; and\r\nit is also not improbable that, by the old law or custom, if the\r\nadulterer was caught in the fact, he was at the mercy of the injured\r\nhusband, and that the husband might punish with death his adulterous\r\nwife. By the Julian law, a woman convicted of adultery was mulcted\r\nin half of her dowry (_dos_) and the third part of her property\r\n(_bona_), and banished (_relegata_) to some miserable island, such\r\nas Seriphos, for instance. The adulterer was mulcted in half his\r\nproperty, and banished in like manner. This law did not inflict the\r\npunishment of death on either party; and in those instances under\r\nthe emperors in which death was inflicted, it must be considered as\r\nan extraordinary punishment, and beyond the provisions of the Julian\r\nlaw. The Julian law permitted the father (both adoptive and natural)\r\nto kill the adulterer and adulteress in certain cases, as to which\r\nthere were several nice distinctions established by the law. If the\r\nwife was divorced for adultery, the husband was entitled to retain\r\npart of the dowry. By a constitution of the Emperor Constantine, the\r\noffence in the adulterer was made capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERSĀRĬA, a note-book, memorandum-book, posting-book, in which\r\nthe Romans entered memoranda of any importance, especially of money\r\nreceived and expended, which were afterwards transcribed, usually\r\nevery month, into a kind of ledger. (_Tabulae justae, codex accepti\r\net expensi._)\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERSĀRĬUS. [ACTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂDŬNĂTI (ἀδύνατοι), were persons supported by the Athenian state,\r\nwho, on account of infirmity or bodily defects, were unable to obtain\r\na livelihood. The sum which they received from the state appears to\r\nhave varied at different times. In the time of Lysias and Aristotle,\r\none obolus a day was given; but it appears to have been afterwards\r\nincreased to two oboli. The bounty was restricted to persons whose\r\nproperty was under three minae; and the examination of those who\r\nwere entitled to it belonged to the senate of the Five Hundred.\r\nPeisistratus is said to have been the first to introduce a law for\r\nthe maintenance of those persons who had been mutilated in war.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVOCATUS, seems originally to have signified any person who gave\r\nanother his aid in any affair or business, as a witness for instance;\r\nor for the purpose of aiding and protecting him in taking possession\r\nof a piece of property. It was also used to express a person who\r\nin any way gave his advice and aid to another in the management\r\nof a cause; but, in the time of Cicero, the word did not signify\r\nthe orator or patronus who made the speech. Under the emperors it\r\nsignified a person who in any way assisted in the conduct of a cause,\r\nand was sometimes equivalent to orator. The advocate’s fee was then\r\ncalled _Honorarium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂDỸTUM. [TEMPLUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAEDES. [DOMUS; TEMPLUM.]\r\n\r\nAEDĪLES (ἀγορανόμοι). The name of these functionaries is said to be\r\nderived from their having the care of the temple (_aedes_) of Ceres.\r\nThe aediles were originally two in number: they were elected from the\r\nplebs, and the institution of the office dates from the same time as\r\nthat of the tribunes of the plebs, B.C. 494. Their duties at first\r\nseem to have been merely ministerial; they were the assistants of the\r\ntribunes in such matters as the tribunes entrusted to them, among\r\nwhich are enumerated the hearing of causes of smaller importance.\r\nAt an early period after their institution (B.C. 446), we find them\r\nappointed the keepers of the senatus-consulta, which the consuls\r\nhad hitherto arbitrarily suppressed or altered. They were also the\r\nkeepers of the plebiscita. Other functions were gradually entrusted\r\nto them, and it is not always easy to distinguish their duties from\r\nsome of those which belong to the censors. They had the general\r\nsuperintendence of buildings, both sacred and private; under this\r\npower they provided for the support and repair of temples, curiae,\r\n&c., and took care that private buildings which were in a ruinous\r\nstate were repaired by the owners or pulled down. The care of the\r\nsupply and distribution of water, of the streets and pavements, with\r\nthe cleansing and draining of the city, belonged to the aediles;\r\nand, of course, the care of the cloacae. They had the office of\r\ndistributing corn among the plebs, but this distribution of corn at\r\nRome must not be confounded with the duty of purchasing or procuring\r\nit from foreign parts, which was performed by the consuls, quaestors,\r\nand praetors, and sometimes by an extraordinary magistrate, as the\r\npraefectus annonae. The aediles had to see that the public lands\r\nwere not improperly used, and that the pasture grounds of the state\r\nwere not trespassed on; and they had power to punish by fine any\r\nunlawful act in this respect. They had a general superintendence over\r\nbuying and selling, and, as a consequence, the supervision of the\r\nmarkets, of things exposed to sale, such as slaves, and of weights\r\nand measures; from this part of their duty is derived the name under\r\nwhich the aediles are mentioned by the Greek writers (ἀγορανόμοι).\r\nIt was their business to see that no new deities or religious rites\r\nwere introduced into the city, to look after the observance of\r\nreligious ceremonies, and the celebrations of the ancient feasts\r\nand festivals. The general superintendence of police comprehended\r\nthe duty of preserving order, regard to decency, and the inspection\r\nof the baths and houses of entertainment. The aediles had various\r\nofficers under them, as praecones, scribae, and viatores. The AEDILES\r\nCURULES, who were also two in number, were originally chosen only\r\nfrom the patricians, afterwards alternately from the patricians and\r\nthe plebs, and at last indifferently from both. The office of curule\r\naediles was instituted B.C. 365, and, according to Livy, on the\r\noccasion of the plebeian aediles refusing to consent to celebrate the\r\nLudi Maximi for the space of four days instead of three; upon which a\r\nsenatus-consultum was passed, by which two aediles were to be chosen\r\nfrom the patricians. From this time four aediles, two plebeian and\r\ntwo curule, were annually elected. The distinctive honours of the\r\ncurule aediles were, the sella curulis, from whence their title is\r\nderived, the toga praetexta, precedence in speaking in the senate,\r\nand the jus imaginum. Only the curule aediles had the jus edicendi,\r\nor the right of promulgating edicta; but the rules comprised in their\r\nedicta served for the guidance of all the aediles. The edicta of the\r\ncurule aediles were founded on their authority as superintendents\r\nof the markets, and of buying and selling in general. Accordingly,\r\ntheir edicts had mainly, or perhaps solely, reference to the rules\r\nas to buying and selling, and contracts for bargain and sale. The\r\npersons both of the plebeian and curule aediles were sacrosancti. It\r\nseems that after the appointment of the curule aediles, the functions\r\nformerly exercised by the plebeian aediles were exercised, with some\r\nfew exceptions, by all the aediles indifferently. Within five days\r\nafter being elected, or entering on office, they were required to\r\ndetermine by lot, or by agreement among themselves, what parts of\r\nthe city each should take under his superintendence; and each aedile\r\nalone had the care of looking after the paving and cleansing of the\r\nstreets, and other matters, it may be presumed, of the same local\r\ncharacter within his district. The other duties of the office seem\r\nto have been exercised by them jointly. In the superintendence of\r\nthe public festivals or solemnities, there was a further distinction\r\nbetween the two sets of aediles. Many of these festivals, such as\r\nthose of Flora and Ceres, were superintended by either set of aediles\r\nindifferently; but the plebeian games were under the superintendence\r\nof the plebeian aediles, who had an allowance of money for that\r\npurpose; and the fines levied on the pecuarii, and others, seem to\r\nhave been appropriated to these among other public purposes. The\r\ncelebration of the Ludi Magni or Romani, of the Ludi Scenici, or\r\ndramatic representations, and the Ludi Megalesii, belonged specially\r\nto the curule aediles, and it was on such occasions that they often\r\nincurred a prodigious expense, with a view of pleasing the people,\r\nand securing their votes in future elections. This extravagant\r\nexpenditure of the aediles arose after the close of the second Punic\r\nwar, and increased with the opportunities which individuals had of\r\nenriching themselves after the Roman arms were carried into Greece,\r\nAfrica, and Spain. Even the prodigality of the emperors hardly\r\nsurpassed that of individual curule aediles under the republic; such\r\nas C. Julius Caesar, the dictator, P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther,\r\nand, above all, M. Aemilius Scaurus, whose expenditure was not\r\nlimited to bare show, but comprehended objects of public utility, as\r\nthe reparation of walls, dock-yards, ports, and aquaeducts. In B.C.\r\n45, Julius Caesar caused two curule aediles and four plebeian aediles\r\nto be elected; and thenceforward, at least so long as the office of\r\naedile was of any importance, six aediles were annually elected. The\r\ntwo new plebeian aediles were called Cereales, and their duty was\r\nto look after the supply of corn. Though their office may not have\r\nbeen of any great importance after the institution of a praefectus\r\nannonae by Augustus, there is no doubt that it existed for several\r\ncenturies, and at least as late as the time of the emperor Gordian.\r\nThe aediles belonged to the class of the minores magistratus. The\r\nplebeian aediles were originally chosen at the comitia centuriata,\r\nbut afterwards at the comitia tributa, in which comitia the curule\r\naediles also were chosen. It appears that until the lex annalis\r\nwas passed (B.C. 180) a Roman citizen might be a candidate for any\r\noffice after completing his twenty-seventh year. This law fixed the\r\nage at which each office might be enjoyed, and it seems that the\r\nage fixed for the aedileship was thirty-six. The aediles existed\r\nunder the emperors; but their powers were gradually diminished, and\r\ntheir functions exercised by new officers created by the emperors.\r\nAfter the battle of Actium, Augustus appointed a Praefectus urbi,\r\nwho exercised the general police, which had formerly been one of\r\nthe duties of the aediles. Augustus also took from the aediles, or\r\nexercised himself, the office of superintending the religious rites,\r\nand the banishing from the city of all foreign ceremonials; he also\r\nassumed the superintendence of the temples, and thus may be said\r\nto have destroyed the aedileship by depriving it of its old and\r\noriginal function. The last recorded instance of the splendours of\r\nthe aedileship is the administration of Agrippa, who volunteered to\r\ntake the office, and repaired all the public buildings and all the\r\nroads at his own expense, without drawing anything from the treasury.\r\nThe aedileship had, however, lost its true character before this\r\ntime. Agrippa had already been consul before he accepted the office\r\nof aedile, and his munificent expenditure in this nominal office was\r\nthe close of the splendour of the aedileship. Augustus appointed\r\nthe curule aediles specially to the office of putting out fires,\r\nand placed a body of 600 slaves at their command; but the praefecti\r\nvigilum afterwards performed this duty. They retained, under the\r\nearly emperors, a kind of police, for the purpose of repressing open\r\nlicentiousness and disorder. The coloniae, and the municipia of the\r\nlater period, had also their aediles, whose numbers and functions\r\nvaried in different places. They seem, however, as to their powers\r\nand duties, to have resembled the aediles of Rome. They were chosen\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n\r\nAEDĬTŬI, AEDĬTŬMI, AEDĬTĬMI (called by the Greeks νεωκόροι, ζάκοροι,\r\nand ὑποζάκοροι), were persons who took care of the temples, attended\r\nto the cleaning of them, &c. They appear to have lived in the\r\ntemples, or near them, and to have acted as ciceroni to those persons\r\nwho wished to see them. Subsequently among the Greeks, the menial\r\nservices connected with this office were left to slaves, and the\r\npersons called _neocori_ became priestly officers of high rank, who\r\nhad the chief superintendence of temples, their treasures, and the\r\nsacred rites observed in them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aegis worn by Athena.\r\n\r\nFrom Torso at Dresden. From Ancient Statues.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAEGIS (αἰγίς) signifies, literally, a goat-skin. According to ancient\r\nmythology, the aegis worn by Zeus was the hide of the goat Amaltheia,\r\nwhich had suckled him in his infancy. Homer always represents it as\r\npart of the armour of Zeus, whom on this account he distinguishes by\r\nthe epithet _aegis-bearing_ (αἰγίοχος). He, however, asserts, that\r\nit was borrowed on different occasions both by Apollo and Athena.\r\nThe aegis was connected with the shield of Zeus, either serving as\r\na covering over it, or as a belt by which it was suspended from the\r\nright shoulder. Homer accordingly uses the word to denote not only\r\nthe goat-skin, which it properly signified, but also the shield to\r\nwhich it belonged. The aegis was adorned in a style corresponding to\r\nthe might and majesty of the father of the gods. In the middle of it\r\nwas fixed the appalling Gorgon’s head, and its border was surrounded\r\nwith golden tassels (θύσανοι), each of which was worth a hecatomb.\r\nThe aegis is usually seen on the statues of Athena, in which it is\r\na sort of scarf falling obliquely over the right shoulder, so as to\r\npass round the body under the left arm. The serpents of the Gorgon’s\r\nhead are transferred to the border of the skin. (See the left-hand\r\nfigure in the cut.) The later poets and artists represent the aegis\r\nas a breast-plate covered with metal in the form of scales. (See the\r\nright-hand figure.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAENĔĀTŌRES, were those who blew upon wind instruments in the Roman\r\narmy; namely, the _buccinatores_, _cornicines_, and _tubicines_. They\r\nwere also employed in the public games.\r\n\r\n\r\nAENIGMA (αἴνιγμα), a riddle. It was an ancient custom among the\r\nGreeks to amuse themselves by proposing riddles at their symposia, or\r\ndrinking parties. Those who were successful in solving them, received\r\na prize, which usually consisted of wreaths, cakes, &c., while those\r\nwho were unsuccessful were condemned to drink in one breath a certain\r\nquantity of wine, sometimes mixed with salt water. Those riddles\r\nwhich have come down to us are mostly in hexameter verse. The Romans\r\nseem to have been too serious to find any great amusement in riddles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAENUM, or ĂHĒNUM (sc. _vas_), a brazen vessel, used for boiling.\r\nThe word is also frequently used in the sense of a dyer’s copper;\r\nand, as purple was the most celebrated dye of antiquity, we find the\r\nexpressions _Sidonium aënum_, _Tyrium aënum_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAEŌRA, or ĔŌRA (αἰώρα, ἐώρα), a festival at Athens, accompanied with\r\nsacrifices and banquets, whence it is sometimes called εὔδειπνος. It\r\nwas probably instituted in honour of Icarius and his daughter Erigone.\r\n\r\n\r\nAERA. [CHRONOLOGIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAERĀRĬI, a class of Roman citizens, who were not included in the\r\nthirty tribes instituted by Servius Tullius. Although citizens, they\r\ndid not possess the suffragium, or right of voting in the comitia.\r\nThey were _cives sine suffragio_. They also paid the tribute in a\r\ndifferent manner from the other citizens. The Aerarians were chiefly\r\nartisans and freedmen. The Caerites, or inhabitants of the Etruscan\r\ntown of Caere, who obtained the franchise in early times, but without\r\nthe suffragium, were probably the first body of aerarians. Any\r\nRoman citizen guilty of a crime punishable by the censors, might\r\nbe degraded to the rank of an aerarian; so that his civic rights\r\nwere suspended, at least for the time that he was an aerarian. All\r\ncitizens so degraded were classed among the Caerites; whence we find\r\nthe expressions _aerarium facere_ and _in tabulas Caeritum referre_\r\nused as synonymous. Persons who were made _infames_ likewise became\r\naerarians, for they lost the jus honorum and the suffragium. The\r\naerarians had to pay a tributum pro capite which was considerably\r\nhigher than that paid by the other citizens. They were not allowed to\r\nserve in the legions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAERĀRĬI TRĬBŪNI. [AES EQUESTRE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAERĀRĬUM (τὸ δημόσιον), the public treasury at Rome, and hence the\r\npublic money itself. After the banishment of the kings the temple\r\nof Saturn was employed as the place for keeping the public money,\r\nand it continued to be so used till the later times of the empire.\r\nBesides the public money and the accounts connected with it, various\r\nother things were preserved in the treasury; of these the most\r\nimportant were:--1. The standards of the legions. 2. The various\r\nlaws passed from time to time, engraven on brazen tables. 3. The\r\ndecrees of the senate, which were entered there in books kept for the\r\npurpose, though the original documents were preserved in the temple\r\nof Ceres under the custody of the aediles. 4. Various other public\r\ndocuments, the reports and despatches of all generals and governors\r\nof provinces, the names of all foreign ambassadors that came to Rome,\r\n&c. Under the republic the aerarium was divided into two parts: the\r\n_common_ treasury, in which were deposited the regular taxes, and\r\nfrom which were taken the sums of money needed for the ordinary\r\nexpenditure of the state; and the _sacred_ treasury (_aerarium\r\nsanctum_ or _sanctius_), which was never touched except in cases of\r\nextreme peril. Both of these treasuries were in the temple of Saturn,\r\nbut in distinct parts of the temple. The produce of a tax of five\r\nper cent. (_vicesima_) upon the value of every manumitted slave,\r\ncalled _aurum vicesimarium_, was paid into the sacred treasury, as\r\nwell as a portion of the immense wealth obtained by the Romans in\r\ntheir conquests in the East. Under Augustus the provinces and the\r\nadministration of the government were divided between the senate,\r\nas the representative of the old Roman people, and the Caesar: all\r\nthe property of the former continued to be called _aerarium_, and\r\nthat of the latter received the name of _fiscus_. Augustus also\r\nestablished a third treasury, to provide for the pay and support of\r\nthe army, and this received the name of _aerarium militare_. He also\r\nimposed several new taxes to be paid into this aerarium. In the time\r\nof the republic, the entire management of the revenues of the state\r\nbelonged to the senate; and under the superintendence and control of\r\nthe senate the quaestors had the charge of the aerarium. In B.C. 28,\r\nAugustus deprived the quaestors of the charge of the treasury and\r\ngave it to two praefects, whom he allowed the senate to choose from\r\namong the praetors at the end of their year of office. Various other\r\nchanges were made with respect to the charge of the aerarium, but it\r\nwas eventually entrusted, in the reign of Trajan, to praefects, who\r\nappear to have held their office for two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAES (χαλκός), properly signifies a compound of copper and tin,\r\ncorresponding to what we call _bronze_. It is incorrect to translate\r\nit _brass_, which is a combination of copper and zinc, since all the\r\nspecimens of ancient objects, formed of the material called aes,\r\nare found upon analysis to contain no zinc. The employment of aes\r\nwas very general among the ancients; money, vases, and utensils of\r\nall sorts, being made of it. All the most ancient coins in Rome and\r\nthe old Italian states were made of aes, and hence money in general\r\nwas called by this name. For the same reason we have _aes alienum_,\r\nmeaning debt, and _aera_ in the plural, pay to the soldiers. The\r\nRomans had no other coinage except bronze or copper (_aes_), till\r\nB.C. 269, five years before the first Punic war, when silver was\r\nfirst coined; gold was not coined till sixty-two years after silver.\r\nThe first coinage of aes is usually attributed to Servius Tullius,\r\nwho is said to have stamped the money with the image of cattle\r\n(_pecus_), whence it is called _pecunia_. According to some accounts,\r\nit was coined from the commencement of the city, and we know that\r\nthe old Italian states possessed a bronze or copper coinage from the\r\nearliest times. The first coinage was the _as_ [AS], which originally\r\nwas a pound weight; but as in course of time the weight of the _as_\r\nwas reduced not only in Rome, but in the other Italian states, and\r\nthis reduction in weight was not uniform in the different states,\r\nit became usual in all bargains to pay the asses according to their\r\nweight, and not according to their nominal value. The _aes grave_ was\r\nnot the old heavy coins as distinguished from the lighter modern; but\r\nit signified any number of copper coins reckoned according to the old\r\nstyle, by weight. There was, therefore, no occasion for the state\r\nto suppress the circulation of the old copper coins, since in all\r\nbargains the asses were not reckoned by tale, but by weight.--Bronze\r\nor copper (χαλκός) was very little used by the Greeks for money in\r\nearly times. Silver was originally the universal currency, and copper\r\nappears to have been seldom coined till after the time of Alexander\r\nthe Great. The copper coin was called _Chalcous_ (χαλκούς). The\r\nsmallest silver coin at Athens was the quarter-obol, and the chalcous\r\nwas the half of that, or the eighth of an obol. In later times, the\r\nobol was coined of copper as well as silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nAES CIRCUMFORĀNĔUM, money borrowed from the Roman bankers\r\n(_argentarii_), who had shops in porticoes round the forum.\r\n\r\n\r\nAES ĔQUESTRE, AES HORDĔĀRĬUM, and AES MĪLĬTĀRE, were the ancient\r\nterms for the pay of the Roman soldiers, before the regular\r\n_stipendium_ was introduced. The _aes equestre_ was the sum of\r\nmoney given for the purchase of the horse of an eques; the _aes\r\nhordearium_, the sum paid yearly for its keep, in other words the\r\npay of an eques; and the _aes militare_, the pay of a foot soldier.\r\nNone of this money seems to have been taken from the public treasury,\r\nbut to have been paid by certain private persons, to whom this duty\r\nwas assigned by the state. The _aes hordearium_, which amounted to\r\n2000 asses, had to be paid by single women (_viduae_, i.e. both\r\nmaidens and widows) and orphans (_orbi_), provided they possessed a\r\ncertain amount of property. The _aes equestre_, which amounted to\r\n10,000 asses, was probably also paid by the same class of persons.\r\nThe _aes militare_, the amount of which is not expressly mentioned,\r\nhad to be paid by the _tribuni aerarii_, and if not paid, the foot\r\nsoldiers had a right of distress against them. It is generally\r\nassumed that these _tribuni aerarii_ were magistrates connected with\r\nthe treasury, and that they were the assistants of the quaestors;\r\nbut there are good reasons for believing that the _tribuni aerarii_\r\nwere private persons, who were liable to the payment of the _aes\r\nmilitare_, and upon whose property a distress might be levied, if\r\nthe money were not paid. They were probably persons whose property\r\nwas rated at a certain sum in the census, and we may conjecture that\r\nthey obtained the name of _tribuni aerarii_ because they levied the\r\n_tributum_, which was imposed for the purpose of paying the army,\r\nand then paid it to the soldiers. These _tribuni aerarii_ were no\r\nlonger needed when the state took into its own hands the payment of\r\nthe troops; but they were revived in B.C. 70, as a distinct class in\r\nthe commonwealth, by the Lex Aurelia, which gave the judicia to the\r\nsenators, equites and tribuni aerarii.\r\n\r\n\r\nAES UXŌRĬUM, was a tax paid by men who reached old age without having\r\nmarried. It was first imposed by the censors in B.C. 403. [LEX JULIA\r\nET PAPIA POPPAEA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAESYMNĒTES (αἰσυμνήτης), a person who was sometimes invested with\r\nunlimited power in the Greek states. His power partook in some degree\r\nof the nature both of kingly and tyrannical authority; since he was\r\nappointed legally, and did not usurp the government, but at the same\r\ntime was not bound by any laws in his public administration. The\r\noffice was not hereditary, nor was it held for life; but it only\r\ncontinued for a limited time, or till some object was accomplished.\r\nThus we read that the inhabitants of Mytilene appointed Pittacus\r\naesymnetes, in order to prevent the return of Alcaeus and the other\r\nexiles. Dionysius compares it with the dictatorship of Rome. In some\r\nstates, such as Cyme and Chalcedon, it was the title borne by the\r\nregular magistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nAETAS. [INFANS; IMPUBES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAETŌLĬCUM FOEDUS (κοινὸν τῶν Αἰτώλων), the Aetolian league, appears\r\nas a powerful political body soon after the death of Alexander\r\nthe Great, viz. during the Lamian war against Antipater. The\r\ncharacteristic difference between the Aetolian and Achaean leagues\r\nwas that the former originally consisted of a confederacy of nations\r\nor tribes, while the latter was a confederacy of towns. The sovereign\r\npower of the confederacy was vested in the general assemblies of\r\nall the confederates (κοινὸν τῶν Αἰτώλων, _concilium Aetolorum_),\r\nand this assembly had the right to discuss all questions respecting\r\npeace and war, and to elect the great civil or military officers\r\nof the league. The ordinary place of meeting was Thermon, but on\r\nextraordinary occasions assemblies were also held in other towns\r\nbelonging to the league, though they were not situated in the country\r\nof Aetolia Proper. The questions which were to be brought before\r\nthe assembly were sometimes discussed previously by a committee,\r\nselected from the great mass, and called Apocleti (ἀπόκλητοι). The\r\ngeneral assembly usually met in the autumn, when the officers of the\r\nleague were elected. The highest among them, as among those of the\r\nAchaean league, bore the title of _Strategus_ (στρατηγός), whose\r\noffice lasted only for one year. The strategus had the right to\r\nconvoke the assembly; he presided in it, introduced the subjects for\r\ndeliberation, and levied the troops. The officers next in rank to the\r\nstrategus were the hipparchus and the public scribe. The political\r\nexistence of the league was destroyed in B.C. 189 by the treaty\r\nwith Rome, and the treachery of the Roman party among the Aetolians\r\nthemselves caused in B.C. 167 five hundred and fifty of the leading\r\npatriots to be put to death, and those who survived the massacre were\r\ncarried to Rome as prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nĀĔTŌMA (ἀέτωμα). [FASTIGIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFĪNES, AFFĪNĬTAS, or ADFĪNES, ADFĪNĬTAS. Affines are the _cognati_\r\n[COGNATI] of husband and wife, the cognati of the husband becoming\r\nthe affines of the wife, and the cognati of the wife the affines\r\nof the husband. The father of a husband is the _socer_ of the\r\nhusband’s wife, and the father of a wife is the _socer_ of the wife’s\r\nhusband. The term _socrus_ expresses the same affinity with respect\r\nto the husband’s and wife’s mothers. A son’s wife is _nurus_, or\r\ndaughter-in-law to the son’s parents; a wife’s husband is _gener_, or\r\nson-in-law to the wife’s parents. Thus the _avus_, _avia_--_pater_,\r\n_mater_--of the wife became by the marriage respectively the _socer\r\nmagnus_, _prosocrus_, or _socrus magna_--_socer_, _socrus_--of the\r\nhusband, who becomes with respect to them severally _progener_ and\r\n_gener_. In like manner the corresponding ancestors of the husband\r\nrespectively assume the same names with respect to the son’s wife,\r\nwho becomes with respect to them _pronurus_ and _nurus_. The son and\r\ndaughter of a husband or wife born of a prior marriage are called\r\n_privignus_ and _privigna_, with respect to their step-father or\r\nstep-mother; and with respect to such children, the step-father\r\nand step-mother are severally called _vitricus_ and _noverca_. The\r\nhusband’s brother becomes _levir_ with respect to the wife, and his\r\nsister becomes _glos_ (the Greek γάλως). Marriage was unlawful among\r\npersons who had become such affines as above mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGALMA (ἄγαλμα) is a general name for a statue or image to represent\r\na god.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGĀSO, a groom, whose business it was to take care of the horses. The\r\nword is also used for a driver of beasts of burden, and is sometimes\r\napplied to a slave who had to perform the lowest menial duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGĂTHŎERGI (ἀγαθοεργοί). In time of war the kings of Sparta had a\r\nbody-guard of three hundred of the noblest of the Spartan youths\r\n(ἱππεῖς), of whom the five eldest retired every year, and were\r\nemployed for one year under the name of _Agathoergi_, in missions to\r\nforeign states.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGĔLA (ἀγέλη), an assembly of young men in Crete, who lived together\r\nfrom their eighteenth year till the time of their marriage. An\r\n_agela_ always consisted of the sons of the most noble citizens, and\r\nthe members of it were obliged to marry at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGĒMA (ἄγημα from ἄγω), the name of a chosen body of troops in the\r\nMacedonian army, usually consisting of horsemen.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGER PUBLĬCUS, the public land, was the land belonging to the Roman\r\nstate. It was a recognised principle among the Italian nations that\r\nthe territory of a conquered people belonged to the conquerors.\r\nAccordingly, the Romans were constantly acquiring fresh territory\r\nby the conquest of the surrounding people. The land thus acquired\r\nwas usually disposed of in the following way. 1. The land which was\r\nunder cultivation was either distributed among colonists, who were\r\nsent to occupy it, or it was sold, or it was let out to farm. 2. The\r\nland which was then out of cultivation, and which, owing to war,\r\nwas by far the greater part, might be occupied by any of the Roman\r\ncitizens on the payment of a portion of the yearly produce; a tenth\r\nof the produce of arable land, and a fifth of the produce of the\r\nland planted with the vine, the olive, and other valuable trees. 3.\r\nThe land which had previously served as the common pasture land of\r\nthe conquered state, or was suitable for the purpose, continued to\r\nbe used as pasture land by the Roman citizens, who had, however, to\r\npay a certain sum of money for the cattle which they turned upon it.\r\nThe occupation of the public land spoken of above under the second\r\nhead was always expressed by the words _possessio_ and _possidere_,\r\nand the occupier of the land was called the _possessor_. The land\r\ncontinued to be the property of the state; and accordingly we must\r\ndistinguish between the terms _possessio_, which merely indicated\r\nthe use or enjoyment of the land, and _dominium_, which expressed\r\nownership, and was applied to private land, of which a man had the\r\nabsolute ownership. The right of occupying the public land belonged\r\nonly to citizens, and consequently only to the patricians originally,\r\nas they were the state. The plebeians were only subjects, and\r\nconsequently had no right to the property of the state; but it is\r\nprobable that they were permitted to feed their cattle on the public\r\npasture lands. Even when the plebeians became a separate estate by\r\nthe constitution of Servius Tullius, they still obtained no right to\r\nshare in the possession of the public land, which continued to be the\r\nexclusive privilege of the patricians; but as a compensation, each\r\nindividual plebeian received an assignment of a certain quantity of\r\nthe public land as his own property. Henceforth the possession of the\r\npublic land was the privilege of the patricians, and an assignment\r\nof a portion of it the privilege of the plebeians. As the state\r\nacquired new lands by conquest, the plebeians ought to have received\r\nassignments of part of them, but since the patricians were the\r\ngoverning body, they generally refused to make any such assignment,\r\nand continued to keep the whole as part of the ager publicus, whereby\r\nthe enjoyment of it belonged to them alone. Hence, we constantly\r\nread of the plebeians claiming, and sometimes enforcing, a division\r\nof such land. With the extension of the conquests of Rome, the ager\r\npublicus constantly increased, and thus a large portion of Italy fell\r\ninto the hands of the patricians, who frequently withheld from the\r\nstate the annual payments of a tenth and a fifth, which they were\r\nbound to pay for the possession of the land, and thus deprived the\r\nstate of a fund for the expenses of the war. In addition to which\r\nthey used slaves as cultivators and shepherds, since freemen were\r\nliable to be drawn off from field-labour to military service, and\r\nslave-labour was consequently far cheaper. In this way the number\r\nof free labourers was diminished, and that of slaves augmented.\r\nTo remedy this state of things several laws were from time to time\r\nproposed and carried, which were most violently opposed by the\r\npatricians. All laws which related to the _public_ land are called\r\nby the general title of _Leges Agrariae_, and accordingly all the\r\nearly laws relating to the possession of the public land by the\r\npatricians, and to the assignment of portions of it to the plebeians,\r\nwere strictly agrarian laws; but the first law to which this name\r\nis usually applied was proposed soon after the establishment of the\r\nrepublic by the consul, Sp. Cassius, in B.C. 486. Its object was to\r\nset apart the portion of the public land which the patricians were to\r\npossess, to divide the rest among the plebeians, to levy the payment\r\ndue for the possession, and to apply it to paying the army. The first\r\nlaw, however, which really deprived the patricians of the advantages\r\nthey had previously enjoyed in the occupation of the public land was\r\nthe agrarian law of C. Licinius Stolo (B.C. 366), which limited each\r\nindividual’s possession of public land to 500 jugera, and declared\r\nthat no individual should have above 100 large and 500 smaller cattle\r\non the public pastures: it further enacted that the surplus land was\r\nto be divided among the plebeians. As this law, however, was soon\r\ndisregarded, it was revived again by Tib. Sempronius Gracchus (B.C.\r\n133), with some alterations and additions. The details of the other\r\nagrarian laws mentioned in Roman history are given under the name of\r\nthe lex by which they are called. [LEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAGGER (χῶμα), from _ad_ and _gero_, was used in general for a heap\r\nor mound of any kind. It was more particularly applied:--(1) To a\r\nmound, usually composed of earth, which was raised round a besieged\r\ntown, and which was gradually increased in breadth and height, till\r\nit equalled or overtopped the walls. The agger was sometimes made,\r\nnot only of earth, but of wood, hurdles, &c.; whence we read of the\r\nagger being set on fire.--(2) To the earthen wall surrounding a Roman\r\nencampment, composed of the earth dug from the ditch (_fossa_), which\r\nwas usually 9 feet broad and 7 feet deep; but if any attack was\r\napprehended, the depth was increased to 12 feet and the breadth to 13\r\nfeet. Sharp stakes, &c., were usually fixed upon the agger, which was\r\nthen called _vallum_. When both words are used, the agger means the\r\nmound of earth, and the vallum the stakes, &c., which were fixed upon\r\nthe agger.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGITĀTŌRES. [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAGMEN. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAGNĀTI. [COGNATI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAGNŌMEN [NOMEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGŌNĀLĬA or ĂGŌNĬA, one of the most ancient festivals at Rome, its\r\ninstitution being attributed to Numa Pompilius. It was celebrated on\r\nthe 9th of January, the 21st of May, and the 11th of December; to\r\nwhich we should probably add the 17th of March, the day on which the\r\nLiberalia was celebrated, since this festival is also called _Agonia_\r\nor _Agonium Martiale_. The object of this festival was a disputed\r\npoint among the ancients themselves. The victim which was offered\r\nwas a ram; the person who offered it was the rex sacrificulus; and\r\nthe place where it was offered was the regia. Now the ram was the\r\nusual victim presented to the guardian gods of the state, and the\r\nrex sacrificulus and the regia could be employed only for such\r\nceremonies as were connected with the highest gods and affected the\r\nweal of the whole state. Regarding the sacrifice in this light, we\r\nsee a reason for its being offered several times in the year. The\r\netymology of the name was also a subject of much dispute among the\r\nancients; and the various etymologies that were proposed are given\r\nat length by Ovid (_Fast._ i. 319-332). None of these, however, are\r\nat all satisfactory; and we would therefore suggest that it may have\r\nreceived its name from the sacrifice having been offered on the\r\nQuirinal hill, which was originally called _Agonus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGŌNES (ἀγῶνες), the general term among the Greeks for the contests\r\nat their great national games. The word also signified law-suits, and\r\nwas especially employed in the phrase ἀγῶνες τιμητοί and ἀτίμητοι.\r\n[TIMEMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGONŎTHĔTAE (ἀγωνοθέται), persons in the Grecian games who decided\r\ndisputes, and adjudged the prizes to the victors. Originally, the\r\nperson who instituted the contest and offered the prize was the\r\n_Agonothetes_, and this continued to be the practice in those games\r\nwhich were instituted by kings or private persons. But in the great\r\npublic games, such as the Isthmian, Pythian, &c., the _Agonothetae_\r\nwere either the representatives of different states, as the\r\nAmphictyons at the Pythian games, or were chosen from the people in\r\nwhose country the games were celebrated. During the flourishing times\r\nof the Grecian republics the Eleans were the _Agonothetae_ in the\r\nOlympic games, the Corinthians in the Isthmian games, the Amphictyons\r\nin the Pythian games, and the Corinthians, Argives, and inhabitants\r\nof Cleonae in the Nemaean games. The _Agonothetae_ were also called\r\n_Aesymnetae_ (αἰσυμνῆται), _Agonarchae_ (ἀγωνάρχαι), _Agonodicae_\r\n(ἀγωνοδίκαι), _Athlothetae_ (ἀθλοθέται), _Rhabduchi_ (ῥαβδοῦχοι),\r\nor _Rhabdonomi_ (ῥαβδονόμοι, from the staff which they carried as\r\nan emblem of authority), _Brabeis_ (βραβεῖς), and _Brabeutae_\r\n(βραβευταί).\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGŎRA (ἀγορά) properly means an assembly of any kind, and is usually\r\nemployed by Homer to designate the general assembly of the people.\r\nThe Agora seems to have been considered an essential part of the\r\nconstitution of the early Grecian states. It was usually convoked\r\nby the king, but occasionally by some distinguished chieftain,\r\nas, for example, by Achilles before Troy. The king occupied the\r\nmost important seat in these assemblies, and near him sat the\r\nnobles, while the people stood or sat in a circle around them. The\r\npeople appear to have had no right of speaking or voting in these\r\nassemblies, but merely to have been called together to hear what\r\nhad been already agreed upon in the council of the nobles, and to\r\nexpress their feelings as a body. The council of the nobles is called\r\n_Boulé_ (βουλή) and _Thoöcus_ (θόωκος), and sometimes even _Agora_.\r\nAmong the Athenians, the proper name for the assembly of the people\r\nwas _Ecclesia_ (ἐκκλησία), and among the Dorians _Halia_ (ἁλία). The\r\nterm Agora was confined at Athens to the assemblies of the phylae and\r\ndemi. The name Agora was early transferred from the assembly itself\r\nto the place in which it was held; and thus it came to be used for\r\nthe market-place, where goods of all descriptions were bought and\r\nsold. Hence it answers to the Roman _forum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂGŎRĀNŎMI (ἀγορανόμοι), public functionaries in most of the Grecian\r\nstates, whose duties corresponded in many respects with those of the\r\nRoman aediles. At Athens their number was ten, five for the city, and\r\nfive for the Peiraeus, and they were chosen by lot. The principal\r\nduty of the Agoranomi was, as their name imports, to inspect the\r\nmarket, and to see that all the laws respecting its regulation were\r\nproperly observed. They had the inspection of all things that were\r\nsold in the market, with the exception of corn, which was subject\r\nto the jurisdiction of special officers, called _Sitophylaces_\r\n(σιτοφύλακες). They regulated the price and quantity of articles\r\nexposed for sale, and punished all persons convicted of cheating,\r\nespecially by means of false weights and measures. They had the power\r\nof fining all citizens who infringed upon the rules of the market,\r\nand of whipping all slaves and foreigners guilty of a like offence.\r\nThey also collected the market dues, and had the care of all the\r\ntemples and fountains in the market place.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRĀRĬAE LĒGES. [AGER PUBLICUS; LEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRAULĬA (ἀγραύλια) was a festival celebrated by the Athenians\r\nin honour of Agraulos, the daughter of Cecrops. It was perhaps\r\nconnected with the solemn oath, which all Athenians, when they\r\narrived at manhood (ἔφηβοι), were obliged to take in the temple of\r\nAgraulos, that they would fight for their country, and always observe\r\nits laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRĪMENSŌRES, or “land surveyors,” a college established under the\r\nRoman emperors. Like the jurisconsults, they had regular schools,\r\nand were paid handsome salaries by the state. Their business was\r\nto measure unassigned lands for the state, and ordinary lands for\r\nthe proprietors, and to fix and maintain boundaries. Their writings\r\non the subject of their art were very numerous; and we have still\r\nscientific treatises on the law of boundaries, such as those by\r\nFrontinus and Hyginus.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRIŌNĬA (ἀγριώνια), a festival which was celebrated at Orchomenus,\r\nin Boeotia, in honour of Dionysus, surnamed Agrionius. A human being\r\nused originally to be sacrificed at this festival, but this sacrifice\r\nseems to have been avoided in later times. One instance, however,\r\noccurred in the days of Plutarch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRONŎMI (ἀγρονόμοι), the country-police, probably in Attica, whose\r\nduties corresponded in most respects to those of the astynomi in the\r\ncity, and who appear to have performed nearly the same duties as the\r\nhylori (ὑλωροί).\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRŎTĔRAS THŬSIA (ἀγροτέρας θυσία), a festival celebrated every year\r\nat Athens in honour of Artemis, surnamed Agrotera (from ἄγρα, the\r\nchase). It was solemnized on the sixth of the month of Boëdromion,\r\nand consisted of a sacrifice of 500 goats, which continued to be\r\noffered in the time of Xenophon. Its origin is thus related:--When\r\nthe Persians invaded Attica, the Athenians made a vow to sacrifice\r\nto Artemis Agrotera as many goats as there should be enemies slain\r\nat Marathon. But as the number of enemies slain was so great that\r\nan equal number of goats could not be found at once, the Athenians\r\ndecreed that 500 should be sacrificed every year.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGYRTAE (ἀγύρται), mendicant priests, who were accustomed to travel\r\nthrough the different towns of Greece, soliciting alms for the gods\r\nwhom they served, and whose images they carried, either on their\r\nshoulders or on beasts of burthen. They were, generally speaking,\r\npersons of the lowest and most abandoned character.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂHĒNUM. [AENUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAIKIAS DĬKĒ (αἰκίας δίκη), an action brought at Athens, before the\r\ncourt of the Forty (οἱ τετταράκοντα), against any individual who\r\nhad struck a citizen. Any citizen who had been thus insulted might\r\nproceed against the offending party, either by the αἰκίας δίκη,\r\nwhich was a private action, or by the ὕβρεως γραφή, which was looked\r\nupon in the light of a public prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nAITHOUSA (αἴθουσα), a word only used by Homer, is probably for\r\nαἴθουσα στοά, a portico exposed to the sun. From the passages in\r\nwhich it occurs, it seems to denote a covered portico, opening on to\r\nthe court of the house, αὐλή, in front of the vestibule, πρόθυρον.\r\n\r\n\r\nĀLA, part of a Roman house. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĀLA, ĀLĀRES, ĀLĀRĬI. _Ala_, which literally means _a wing_, was from\r\nthe earliest epochs employed to denote the wing of an army, but in\r\nprocess of time was frequently used in a restricted sense.--(1) When\r\na Roman army was composed of Roman citizens exclusively, the flanks\r\nof the infantry when drawn up in battle array were covered on the\r\nright and left by the cavalry; and hence _Ala_ denoted the body of\r\nhorse which was attached to and served along with the foot-soldiers\r\nof the legion.--(2) When, at a later date, the Roman armies were\r\ncomposed partly of Roman citizens and partly of _Socii_, either\r\n_Latini_ or _Italici_, it became the practice to marshal the Roman\r\ntroops in the centre of the battle line and the Socii upon the wings.\r\nHence _ala_ and _alarii_ denoted the contingent furnished by the\r\nallies, both horse and foot, and the two divisions were distinguished\r\nas _dextera ala_ and _sinistra ala_.--(3) When the whole of the\r\ninhabitants of Italy had been admitted to the privileges of Roman\r\ncitizens the terms _alarii_, _cohortes alariae_ were transferred\r\nto the _foreign_ troops serving along with the Roman armies.--(4)\r\nLastly, under the empire, the term _ala_ was applied to regiments\r\nof horse, raised it would seem with very few exceptions in the\r\nprovinces, serving apart from the legions and the cavalry of the\r\nlegions.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂLĂBARCHĒS (ἀλαβάρχης), the chief magistrate of the Jews at\r\nAlexandria, whose duties, as far as the government was concerned,\r\nchiefly consisted in raising and paying the taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂLĂBASTER or ĂLĂBASTRUM, a vessel or pot used for containing\r\nperfumes, or rather ointments, made of that species of marble which\r\nmineralogists call _gypsum_, and which is usually designated by the\r\nname of _alabaster_. When varieties of colour occur in the same\r\nstone, and are disposed in bands or horizontal strata, it is often\r\ncalled onyx alabaster; and when dispersed irregularly, as if in\r\nclouds, it is distinguished as agate alabaster. The term seems to\r\nhave been employed to denote vessels appropriated to these uses, even\r\nwhen they were not made of the material from which it is supposed\r\nthey originally received their name. Thus Theocritus speaks of\r\ngolden alabastra. These vessels were of a tapering shape, and very\r\noften had a long narrow neck, which was sealed; so that when Mary,\r\nthe sister of Lazarus, is said by St. Mark to break the alabaster\r\nbox of ointment for the purpose of anointing our Saviour, it appears\r\nprobable that she only broke the extremity of the neck, which was\r\nthus closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nĀLĀRĬI. [ALA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂLAUDA, a Gaulish word, the prototype of the modern French\r\n_Alouette_, denoting a small crested bird of the lark kind. The name\r\nalauda was bestowed by Julius Caesar on a legion of picked men, which\r\nhe raised at his own expense among the inhabitants of Transalpine\r\nGaul, about the year B.C. 55, which he equipped and disciplined after\r\nthe Roman fashion, and on which he at a subsequent period bestowed\r\nthe freedom of the state. The designation was, in all probability,\r\napplied from a plume upon the helmet, resembling the “apex” of the\r\nbird in question, or from the general shape and appearance of the\r\nhead-piece.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBŎGĂLĒRUS. [APEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nALBUM, a tablet of any material on which the praetor’s edicts, and\r\nthe rules relating to actions and interdicts, were written. The\r\ntablet was put up in a public place, in order that all the world\r\nmight have notice of its contents. According to some authorities,\r\nthe album was so called because it was either a white material or a\r\nmaterial whitened, and of course the writing would be of a different\r\ncolour. According to other authorities, it was so called because the\r\nwriting was in white letters. Probably the word album originally\r\nmeant any tablet containing anything of a public nature. We know that\r\nit was, in course of time, used to signify a list of any public body;\r\nthus we find _album judicum_, or the body out of which judices were\r\nto be chosen [JUDEX], and _album senatorium_, or list of senators.\r\n\r\n\r\nĀLĔA, gaming, or playing at a game of chance of any kind: hence\r\n_aleo_, _aleator_, a gamester, a gambler. Playing with _tali_, or\r\n_tesserae_, was generally understood, because this was by far the\r\nmost common game of chance among the Romans. Gaming was forbidden\r\nby the Roman laws, both during the times of the republic and under\r\nthe emperors, but was tolerated in the month of December at the\r\nSaturnalia, which was a period of general relaxation; and old men\r\nwere allowed to amuse themselves in this manner at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂLĬCŬLA (ἄλλιξ or ἄλληξ), an upper dress, in all probability\r\nidentical with the chlamys.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂLIMENTĀRII PŬĔRI ET PŬELLAE. In the Roman republic the poorer\r\ncitizens were assisted by public distributions of corn, oil, and\r\nmoney, which were called _congiaria_. [CONGIARIUM.] The Emperor Nerva\r\nwas the first who extended them to children, and Trajan appointed\r\nthem to be made every month, both to orphans and to the children of\r\npoor parents. The children who received them were called _pueri et\r\npuellae alimentarii_, and also (from the emperor) _pueri puellaeque\r\nUlpiani_.\r\n\r\n\r\nĀLĬPĬLUS, a slave, who attended on bathers to remove the superfluous\r\nhair from their bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂLIPTAE (ἀλείπται), among the Greeks, were persons who anointed the\r\nbodies of the athletae preparatory to their entering the palaestra.\r\nThe chief object of this anointing was to close the pores of the\r\nbody, in order to prevent much perspiration, and the weakness\r\nconsequent thereon. The athleta was again anointed after the contest,\r\nin order to restore the tone of the strained muscles. He then bathed,\r\nand had the dust, sweat, and oil scraped off his body, by means\r\nof an instrument similar to the strigil of the Romans, and called\r\n_stlengis_ (στλεγγίς), and afterwards _xystra_ (ξύστρα). The aliptae\r\ntook advantage of the knowledge they necessarily acquired of the\r\nstate of the muscles of the athletae, and their general strength or\r\nweakness of body, to advise them as to their exercises and mode of\r\nlife. They were thus a kind of medical trainers. Among the Romans the\r\naliptae were slaves who scrubbed and anointed their masters in the\r\nbaths. They, too, like the Greek aliptae, appear to have attended to\r\ntheir masters’ constitution and mode of life. They were also called\r\n_unctores_. They used in their operations a kind of scraper called\r\nstrigil, towels (_lintea_), a cruise of oil (_guttus_), which was\r\nusually of horn, a bottle (_ampulla_), and a small vessel called\r\n_lenticula_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Allocutio (Coin of Nero.)]\r\n\r\nALLŎCŪTĬO, an harangue made by a Roman imperator to his soldiers,\r\nto encourage them before battle, or on other occasions. On coins\r\nwe frequently find a figure of an imperator standing on a platform\r\nand addressing the soldiers below him. Such coins bear the epigraph\r\nADLOCUTIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Allocutio. (Coin of Galba.)]\r\n\r\nALŌA or HALŌA (ἀλῶα, ἁλῶα), an Attic festival, but celebrated\r\nprincipally at Eleusis, in honour of Demeter and Dionysus, the\r\ninventors of the plough and protectors of the fruits of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTĀRE. [ARA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂLŪTA. [CALCEUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂLỸTAE (ἀλύται), persons whose business it was to keep order in\r\nthe public games. They received their orders from an _alytarches_\r\n(ἀλυτάρχης), who was himself under the direction of the agonothetae,\r\nor hellenodicae.\r\n\r\n\r\nĀMĂNŬENSIS, or AD MĂNUM SERVUS, a slave, or freedman, whose office it\r\nwas to write letters and other things under his master’s direction.\r\nThe amanuenses must not be confounded with another sort of slaves,\r\nalso called _ad manum servi_, who were always kept ready to be\r\nemployed in any business.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂMĂRYNTHĬA, or ĂMĂRYSĬA (ἀμαρύνθια or ἀμαρύσια), a festival of\r\nArtemis Amarynthia or Amarysia, celebrated, as it seems, originally\r\nat Amarynthus in Euboea, with extraordinary splendour, but also\r\nsolemnised in several places in Attica, such as Athmone.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBARVĀLIĂ. [ARVALES FRATRES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBĬTUS, which literally signifies “a going about,” cannot, perhaps,\r\nbe more nearly expressed than by our word _canvassing_. After the\r\nplebs had formed a distinct class at Rome, and when the whole body\r\nof the citizens had become very greatly increased, we frequently\r\nread, in the Roman writers, of the great efforts which it was\r\nnecessary for candidates to make in order to secure the votes of the\r\ncitizens. At Rome, as in every community into which the element of\r\npopular election enters, solicitation of votes, and open or secret\r\ninfluence and bribery, were among the means by which a candidate\r\nsecured his election to the offices of state. The following are the\r\nprincipal terms occurring in the Roman writers in relation to the\r\ncanvassing for the public offices:--A candidate was called _petitor_;\r\nand his opponent with reference to him _competitor_. A candidate\r\n(_candidatus_) was so called from his appearing in the public places,\r\nsuch as the fora and Campus Martius, before his fellow-citizens,\r\nin a whitened toga. On such occasions the candidate was attended\r\nby his friends (_deductores_), or followed by the poorer citizens\r\n(_sectatores_), who could in no other manner show their good will\r\nor give their assistance. The word _assiduitas_ expressed both\r\nthe continual presence of the candidate at Rome and his continual\r\nsolicitations. The candidate, in going his rounds or taking his\r\nwalk, was accompanied by a _nomenclator_, who gave him the names\r\nof such persons as he might meet; the candidate was thus enabled\r\nto address them by their name, an indirect compliment, which could\r\nnot fail to be generally gratifying to the electors. The candidate\r\naccompanied his address with a shake of the hand (_prensatio_). The\r\nterm _benignitas_ comprehended generally any kind of treating, as\r\nshows, feasts, &c. The _ambitus_, which was the object of several\r\npenal enactments, taken as a generic term, comprehended the two\r\nspecies--_ambitus_ and _largitiones_ (bribery). _Liberalitas_ and\r\n_benignitas_ are opposed by Cicero, as things allowable, to _ambitus_\r\nand _largitio_, as things illegal. Money was paid for votes; and,\r\nin order to insure secrecy and secure the elector, persons called\r\n_interpretes_ were employed to make the bargain, _sequestres_ to hold\r\nthe money till it was to be paid, and _divisores_ to distribute it.\r\nThe offence of ambitus was a matter which belonged to the judicia\r\npublica, and the enactments against it were numerous. One of the\r\nearliest, though not the earliest of all, the Lex Cornelia Baebia\r\n(B.C. 181) was specially directed against _largitiones_. Those\r\nconvicted under it were incapacitated from being candidates for\r\nten years. The Lex Cornelia Fulvia (B.C. 159) punished the offence\r\nwith exile. The Lex Acilia Calpurnia (B.C. 67) imposed a fine on\r\nthe offending party, with exclusion from the senate and all public\r\noffices. The Lex Tullia (B.C. 63), passed in the consulship of\r\nCicero, in addition to the penalty of the Acilian law, inflicted\r\nten years’ exsilium on the offender; and, among other things,\r\nforbade a person to exhibit gladiatorial shows (_gladiatores dare_)\r\nwithin any two years in which he was a candidate, unless he was\r\nrequired to do so, on a fixed day, by a testator’s will. Two years\r\nafterwards the Lex Aufidia was proposed, but not passed; by which,\r\namong other things, it was provided that, if a candidate promised\r\n(_pronuntiavit_) money to a tribe, and did not pay it, he should\r\nbe unpunished; but, if he did pay the money, he should further pay\r\nto each tribe (annually?) 3000 sesterces as long as he lived. This\r\nabsurd proposal occasioned the witticism of Cicero, who said that\r\nClodius observed the law by anticipation; for he promised, but did\r\nnot pay. The Lex Licinia (B.C. 55) was specially directed against the\r\noffence of _sodalitium_, or the wholesale bribery of a tribe by gifts\r\nand treating; and another lex, passed (B.C. 52) when Pompey was sole\r\nconsul, had for its object the establishment of a speedier course\r\nof proceeding on trials for ambitus. All these enactments failed\r\nin completely accomplishing their object. That which no law could\r\nsuppress, so long as the old popular forms retained any of their\r\npristine vigour, was accomplished by the imperial usurpation. Caesar,\r\nwhen dictator, nominated some of the candidates for public offices:\r\nas to the consulship, he managed the appointments to that office just\r\nas he pleased. The popular forms of election were observed during the\r\ntime of Augustus. Tiberius transferred the elections from the comitia\r\nto the senate, by which the offence of ambitus, in its proper sense,\r\nentirely disappeared. The trials for ambitus were numerous in the\r\ntime of the republic. The oration of Cicero in defence of L. Murena,\r\nwho was charged with ambitus, and that in defence of Cn. Plancius,\r\nwho was charged with _sodalitium_, are both extant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBRŎSĬA (ἀμβροσία), the food of the gods, which conferred upon them\r\neternal youth and immortality, and was brought to Jupiter by pigeons.\r\nIt was also used by the gods for anointing their body and hair;\r\nwhence we read of the ambrosial locks of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBŪBAIAE (probably from the Syriac _abub aubub_, a pipe), Eastern\r\ndancing girls, who frequented chiefly the Circus at Rome, and\r\nobtained their living by prostitution and lascivious songs and dances.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBURBĬUM, a sacrifice which was performed at Rome for the\r\npurification of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENTUM. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂMICTŌRĬUM. [STROPHIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂMICTUS. The verb _amicire_ is commonly opposed to _induere_,\r\nthe former being applied to the putting on of the outer garment,\r\nthe pallium, laena, or toga (ἱμάτιον, φᾶρος); the latter, to the\r\nputting on of the inner garment, the tunic (χιτών). In consequence\r\nof this distinction, the verbal nouns _amictus_ and _indutus_, even\r\nwithout any further denomination of the dress being added, indicate\r\nrespectively the outer and inner clothing. In Greek _amicire_ is\r\nexpressed by ἀμφιέννυσθαι, ἀμπέχεσθαι, ἐπιβάλλεσθαι, περιβάλλεσθαι:\r\nand _induere_ by ἐνδύνειν. Hence came ἀμπεχόνη, ἐπίβλημα, and\r\nἐπιβόλαιον, περίβλημα, and περιβόλαιον, an outer garment, a cloak, a\r\nshawl; and ἔνδυμα, an inner garment, a tunic, a shirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHICTỸŎNES (ἀμφικτύονες). Institutions called amphictyonic appear\r\nto have existed in Greece from time immemorial. They seem to have\r\nbeen originally associations of neighbouring tribes, formed for the\r\nregulation of mutual intercourse and the protection of a common\r\ntemple or sanctuary, at which the representatives of the different\r\nmembers met, both to transact business and to celebrate religious\r\nrites and games. One of these associations was of much greater\r\nimportance than all the rest, and was called, by way of eminence,\r\nthe _Amphictyonic League_ or _Council_ (ἀμφικτυονία). It differed\r\nfrom other similar associations in having two places of meeting, the\r\nsanctuaries of two divinities; which were the temple of Demeter, in\r\nthe village of Anthela, near Thermopylae, where the deputies met\r\nin autumn; and that of Apollo, at Delphi, where they assembled in\r\nspring. Its connexion with the latter place not only contributed\r\nto its dignity, but also to its permanence. Its early history is\r\ninvolved in obscurity. Most of the ancients suppose it to have\r\nbeen founded by Amphictyon, the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, from\r\nwhom they imagined that it derived its name: but this opinion is\r\ndestitute of all foundation, and arose from the ancients assigning\r\nthe establishment of their institutions to some mythical hero. There\r\ncan be little doubt as to the true etymology of the word. It was\r\noriginally written ἀμφικτίονες, and consequently signified those that\r\ndwelt around some particular locality. Its institution, however, is\r\nclearly of remote antiquity. It was originally composed of twelve\r\n_tribes_ (not cities or states, it must be observed), each of which\r\ntribes contained various independent cities or states. We learn\r\nfrom Aeschines, that in B.C. 343, eleven of these tribes were as\r\nfollows:--The Thessalians, Boeotians (not Thebans only), Dorians,\r\nIonians, Perrhaebians, Magnetes, Locrians, Oetaeans or Oenianians,\r\nPhthiots or Achaeans of Phthia, Malians, and Phocians; other lists\r\nleave us in doubt whether the remaining tribe were the Dolopes or\r\nDelphians; but as the Delphians could hardly be called a distinct\r\ntribe, their nobles appearing to have been Dorians, it seems probable\r\nthat the Dolopes were originally members, and afterwards supplanted\r\nby the Delphians. All the states belonging to each of these tribes\r\nwere on a footing of perfect equality. Thus Sparta enjoyed no\r\nadvantages over Dorium and Cytinium, two small towns in Doris: and\r\nAthens, an Ionic city, was on a par with Eretria in Euboea, and\r\nPriene in Asia Minor, two other Ionic cities. The ordinary council\r\nwas called _Pylaea_ (πυλαία), from its meeting in the neighbourhood\r\nof Pylae (Thermopylae), but the name was given to the session at\r\nDelphi as well as to that at Thermopylae. The council was composed of\r\ntwo classes of representatives, one called _Pylagorae_ (Πυλαγόραι),\r\nand the other _Hieromnemones_ (Ἱερομνήμονες). Athens sent three\r\nPylagorae and one Hieromnemon; of whom the former were elected\r\napparently for each session, and the latter by lot, probably for a\r\nlonger period. Respecting the relative duties of the Pylagorae and\r\nHieromnemones we have little information: the name of the latter\r\nimplies that they had a more immediate connection with the temple. We\r\nare equally in the dark respecting the numbers who sat in the council\r\nand its mode of proceeding. It would seem that all the deputies had\r\nseats in the council, and took part in its deliberations; but if it\r\nbe true, as appears from Aeschines, that each of the tribes had only\r\ntwo votes, it is clear that all the deputies could not have voted. In\r\naddition to the ordinary council, there was an _ecclesia_ (ἐκκλησία),\r\nor general assembly, including not only the classes above mentioned,\r\nbut also those who had joined in the sacrifices, and were consulting\r\nthe god. It was convened on extraordinary occasions by the chairman\r\nof the council. Of the duties of the Amphictyons nothing will give us\r\na clearer view than the oath they took, which was as follows:--“They\r\nwould destroy no city of the Amphictyons, nor cut off their streams\r\nin war or peace; and if any should do so, they would march against\r\nhim, and destroy his cities; and should any pillage the property of\r\nthe god, or be privy to or plan anything against what was in his\r\ntemple (at Delphi), they would take vengeance on him with hand and\r\nfoot, and voice, and all their might.” From this oath we see that\r\nthe main duty of the deputies was the preservation of the rights and\r\ndignity of the temple of Delphi. We know, too, that after it was\r\nburnt down (B.C. 548), they contracted with the Alcmaeonidae for its\r\nrebuilding. History, moreover, teaches that if the council produced\r\nany palpable effects, it was from their interest in Delphi; and\r\nthough they kept up a standing record of what ought to have been the\r\ninternational law of Greece, they sometimes acquiesced in, and at\r\nother times were parties to, the most iniquitous acts. Of this the\r\ncase of Crissa is an instance. This town lay on the Gulf of Corinth,\r\nnear Delphi, and was much frequented by pilgrims from the West. The\r\nCrissaeans were charged by the Delphians with undue exactions from\r\nthese strangers. The council declared war against them, as guilty\r\nof a wrong against the god. The war lasted ten years, till, at the\r\nsuggestion of Solon, the waters of the Pleistus were turned off,\r\nthen poisoned, and turned again into the city. The besieged drank\r\ntheir fill, and Crissa was soon razed to the ground; and thus, if it\r\nwere an Amphictyonic city, was a solemn oath doubly violated. Its\r\nterritory--the rich Cirrhaean plain--was consecrated to the god,\r\nand curses imprecated upon whomsoever should till or dwell in it.\r\nThus ended the First Sacred War (B.C. 585), in which the Athenians\r\nwere the instruments of Delphian vengeance. The second or Phocian\r\nwar (B.C. 350) was the most important in which the Amphictyons were\r\nconcerned; and in this the Thebans availed themselves of the sanction\r\nof the council to take vengeance on their enemies, the Phocians. To\r\ndo this, however, it was necessary to call in Philip of Macedon, who\r\nreadily proclaimed himself the champion of Apollo, as it opened a\r\npathway to his own ambition. The Phocians were subdued (B.C. 346),\r\nand the council decreed that all their cities, except Abae, should\r\nbe razed, and the inhabitants dispersed in villages not containing\r\nmore than fifty persons. Their two votes were given to Philip, who\r\nthereby gained a pretext for interfering with the affairs of Greece;\r\nand also obtained the recognition of his subjects as Hellenes. The\r\nThird Sacred War arose from the Amphissians tilling the devoted\r\nCirrhaean plain. The Amphictyons called in the assistance of Philip,\r\nwho soon reduced the Amphissians to subjection. Their submission\r\nwas immediately followed by the battle of Chaeroneia (B.C. 338),\r\nand the extinction of the independence of Greece. In the following\r\nyear, a congress of the Amphictyonic states was held, in which war\r\nwas declared as if by united Greece against Persia, and Philip\r\nelected commander-in-chief. On this occasion the Amphictyons assumed\r\nthe character of national representatives as of old, when they set\r\na price upon the head of Ephialtes, for his treason to Greece at\r\nThermopylae. It has been sufficiently shown that the Amphictyons\r\nthemselves did not observe the oaths they took; and that they did not\r\nmuch alleviate the horrors of war, or enforce what they had sworn\r\nto do, is proved by many instances. Thus, for instance, Mycenae was\r\ndestroyed by Argos (B.C. 535), Thespiae and Plataeae by Thebes,\r\nand Thebes herself swept from the face of the earth by Alexander,\r\nwithout the Amphictyons raising one word in opposition. Indeed, a\r\nfew years before the Peloponnesian war, the council was a passive\r\nspectator of what Thucydides calls the Sacred War (ὁ ἱερὸς πόλεμος),\r\nwhen the Lacedaemonians made an expedition to Delphi, and put the\r\ntemple into the hands of the Delphians, the Athenians, after their\r\ndeparture, restoring it to the Phocians. The council is rarely\r\nmentioned after the time of Philip. We are told that Augustus wished\r\nhis new city, Nicopolis (A.D. 31), to be enrolled among the members.\r\nPausanias, in the second century of our era, mentions it as still\r\nexisting, but deprived of all power and influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHĬDRŎMĬA (ἀμφιδρόμια or δρομιάμφιον ἧμαρ), a family festival of\r\nthe Athenians, at which the newly-born child was introduced into\r\nthe family, and received its name. The friends and relations of the\r\nparents were invited to the festival of the amphidromia, which was\r\nheld in the evening, and they generally appeared with presents. The\r\nhouse was decorated on the outside with olive branches when the child\r\nwas a boy, or with garlands of wool when the child was a girl; and a\r\nrepast was prepared for the guests. The child was carried round the\r\nfire by the nurse, and thus, as it were, presented to the gods of the\r\nhouse and to the family, and at the same time received its name, to\r\nwhich the guests were witnesses. The carrying of the child round the\r\nhearth was the principal part of the solemnity, from which its name\r\nwas derived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal Section of the Flavian Amphitheatre.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elevation of one side of the preceding Section.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.\r\n\r\n  A, The arena.\r\n\r\n  _p_, The wall or podium inclosing it.\r\n\r\n  P, The podium itself, on which were chairs, or seats, for the\r\n  senators, &c.\r\n\r\n  M′, The first maenianum, or slope of benches, for the equestrian\r\n  order.\r\n\r\n  M″, The second maenianum.\r\n\r\n  M‴, The third maenianum, elevated considerably above the preceding\r\n  one, and appropriated to the pullati.\r\n\r\n  W, The colonnade, or gallery, which contained seats for women.\r\n\r\n  E, The narrow gallery round the summit of the interior, for the\r\n  attendants who worked the velarium.\r\n\r\n  _pr_, _pr_, The præcinctiones, or landings, at the top of the\r\n  first and second maenianum; in the pavement of which were grated\r\n  apertures, at intervals, to admit light into the vomitoria beneath\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  V V V V, Vomitoria.\r\n\r\n  G G G, The three external galleries through the circumference of\r\n  the building, open to the arcades of the exterior.\r\n\r\n  _g g_, Inner gallery.\r\n\r\nThe situation and arrangement of the staircases, &c., are not\r\nexpressed, as they could not be rendered intelligible without plans\r\nat various levels of the building.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHĬTHĔĀTRUM, an amphitheatre, was a place for the exhibition of\r\npublic shows of combatants, wild beasts, and naval engagements, and\r\nwas entirely surrounded with seats for the spectators; whereas,\r\nin those for dramatic performances, the seats were arranged in a\r\nsemicircle facing the stage. An amphitheatre is therefore frequently\r\ndescribed as a double theatre, consisting of two such semicircles,\r\nor halves, joined together, the spaces allotted to their orchestras\r\nbecoming the inner inclosure, or area, termed the _arena_. The\r\nform, however, of the ancient amphitheatres was not a circle, but\r\ninvariably an ellipse. Gladiatorial shows and combats of wild beasts\r\n(_venationes_) were first exhibited in the forum and the circus; and\r\nit appears that the ancient custom was still preserved till the time\r\nof Julius Caesar. The first building in the form of an amphitheatre\r\nis said to have been erected by C. Scribonius Curio, one of Caesar’s\r\npartisans; but the account which is given of this building sounds\r\nrather fabulous. It is said to have consisted of two wooden theatres,\r\nmade to revolve on pivots, in such a manner that they could, by\r\nmeans of windlasses and machinery, be turned round face to face, so\r\nas to form one building. Soon after Caesar himself erected, in the\r\nCampus Martius, a stationary amphitheatre, made of wood; to which\r\nbuilding the name of _amphitheatrum_ was for the first time given.\r\nThe first stone amphitheatre was built by Statilius Taurus, in the\r\nCampus Martius, at the desire of Augustus. This was the only stone\r\namphitheatre at Rome till the time of Vespasian. One was commenced by\r\nCaligula, but was not continued by Claudius. The one erected by Nero\r\nin the Campus Martius was only a temporary building, made of wood.\r\nThe amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus was burnt in the fire of Rome\r\nin the time of Nero; and hence, as a new one was needed, Vespasian\r\ncommenced the celebrated _Amphitheatrum Flavium_ in the middle of\r\nthe city, in the valley between the Caelian, the Esquiline, and the\r\nVelia, on the spot originally occupied by the lake or large pond\r\nattached to Nero’s palace. Vespasian did not live to finish it. It\r\nwas dedicated by Titus in A.D. 80, but was not completely finished,\r\ntill the reign of Domitian. This immense edifice, which is even\r\nyet comparatively entire, covered nearly six acres of ground, and\r\nwas capable of containing about 87,000 spectators. It is called at\r\nthe present day the _Colosseum_ or _Colisaeum_. The interior of an\r\namphitheatre was divided into three parts, the _arena_, _podium_, and\r\n_gradus_. The clear open space in the centre of the amphitheatre was\r\ncalled the _arena_, because it was covered with sand, or sawdust,\r\nto prevent the gladiators from slipping, and to absorb the blood.\r\nThe size of the arena was not always the same in proportion to the\r\nsize of the amphitheatre, but its average proportion was one-third\r\nof the shorter diameter of the building. The arena was surrounded\r\nby a wall distinguished by the name of _podium_; although such\r\nappellation, perhaps, rather belongs to merely the upper part of\r\nit, forming the parapet, or balcony, before the first or lowermost\r\nseats, nearest to the arena. The arena, therefore, was no more than\r\nan open oval court, surrounded by a wall about fifteen feet high;\r\na height considered necessary, in order to render the spectators\r\nperfectly secure from the attacks of wild beasts. There were four\r\nprincipal entrances leading into the arena; two at the ends of each\r\naxis or diameter of it, to which as many passages led directly from\r\nthe exterior of the building; besides secondary ones, intervening\r\nbetween them, and communicating with the corridors beneath the seats\r\non the podium. The wall or enclosure of the arena is supposed to\r\nhave been faced with marble, more or less sumptuous; besides which,\r\nthere appears to have been, in some instances at least, a sort of\r\nnet-work affixed to the top of the podium, consisting of railing, or\r\nrather open trellis-work of metal. As a further defence, ditches,\r\ncalled _euripi_, sometimes surrounded the arena. The term podium was\r\nalso applied to the terrace, or gallery itself, immediately above\r\nthe arena, which was no wider than to be capable of containing two,\r\nor at the most, three ranges of moveable seats, or chairs. This, as\r\nbeing by far the best situation for distinctly viewing the sports\r\nin the arena, and also more commodiously accessible than the seats\r\nhigher up, was the place set apart for senators and other persons\r\nof distinction, such as foreign ambassadors; and it was here, also,\r\nthat the emperor himself used to sit, in an elevated place, called\r\n_suggestus_ or _cubiculum_, and likewise the person who exhibited\r\nthe games on a place elevated like a pulpit or tribunal (_editoris\r\ntribunal_). Above the podium were the _gradus_, or seats of the other\r\nspectators, which were divided into _maeniana_, or stories. The first\r\n_maenianum_, consisting of fourteen rows of stone or marble seats,\r\nwas appropriated to the equestrian order. The seats appropriated\r\nto the senators and equites were covered with cushions, which were\r\nfirst used in the time of Caligula. Then, after an interval or space,\r\ntermed a _praecinctio_, and forming a continued landing-place from\r\nthe several staircases in it, succeeded the second maenianum, where\r\nwere the seats called _popularia_, for the third class of spectators,\r\nor the populus. Behind this was the second praecinctio, bounded\r\nby a rather high wall; above which was the third maenianum, where\r\nthere were only wooden benches for the _pullati_, or common people.\r\nThe next and last division, namely, that in the highest part of the\r\nbuilding, consisted of a colonnade, or gallery, where females were\r\nallowed to witness the spectacles of the amphitheatre, but some parts\r\nof it were also occupied by the pullati. Each maenianum was not\r\nonly divided from the other by the praecinctio, but was intersected\r\nat intervals by spaces for passages left between the seats, called\r\n_scalae_, or _scalaria_; and the portion between two such passages\r\nwas called _cuneus_, because the space gradually widened like a\r\nwedge, from the podium to the top of the building. The entrances to\r\nthe seats from the outer porticoes were called _vomitoria_. At the\r\nvery summit was the narrow platform for the men who had to attend\r\nto the _velarium_, or awning, by which the building was covered as\r\na defence against the sun and rain. The velarium appears usually to\r\nhave been made of wool, but more costly materials were sometimes\r\nemployed. The first of the preceding cuts represents a longitudinal\r\nsection of the Flavian amphitheatre, and the second, which is on a\r\nlarger scale, a part of the above section, including the exterior\r\nwall, and the seats included between that and the arena. It will\r\nserve to convey an idea of the leading form and general disposition\r\nof the interior. For an account of the gladiatorial contests, and the\r\nshows of wild beasts, exhibited in the amphitheatre, see GLADIATORES,\r\nNAUMACHIA, and VENATIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Amphorae. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nAMPHŎRA (ἀμφορεύς), a vessel used for holding wine, oil, honey,\r\n&c. The following cut represents amphorae in the British Museum.\r\nThey are of various forms and sizes; in general they are tall and\r\nnarrow, with a small neck, and a handle on each side of the neck\r\n(whence the name, from ἀμφί, _on both sides_, and φέρω, to carry),\r\nand terminating at the bottom in a point, which was let into a stand\r\nor stuck in the ground, so that the vessel stood upright: several\r\namphorae have been found in this position in the cellars at Pompeii.\r\nAmphorae were commonly made of earthenware. Homer mentions amphorae\r\nof gold and stone, and the Egyptians had them of brass; glass vessels\r\nof this form have been found at Pompeii. The most common use of the\r\namphora, both among the Greeks and the Romans, was for keeping wine.\r\nThe cork was covered with pitch or gypsum, and (among the Romans)\r\non the outside the title of the wine was painted, the date of the\r\nvintage being marked by the names of the consuls then in office; or,\r\nwhen the jars were of glass, little tickets (_pittoria_, _tesserae_)\r\nwere suspended from them, indicating these particulars.--The Greek\r\namphoreus and the Roman amphora were also names of fixed measures.\r\nThe amphoreus, which was also called _metretes_ (μετρητής) and\r\n_cadus_ (κάδος), was equal to three Roman urnae = 8 gallons, 7·365\r\npints, imperial measure. The Roman amphora was two-thirds of the\r\namphoreus, and was equal to 2 urnae = 8 congii = to 5 gallons, 7·577\r\npints; its solid content was exactly a Roman cubic foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPLĬĀTĬO, an adjournment of a trial, which took place when the\r\njudices after hearing the evidence of the advocates were unable to\r\ncome to a satisfactory conclusion. This they expressed by giving in\r\nthe tablets, on which were the letters N. L. (_non liquet_), and the\r\npraetor, by pronouncing the word _amplius_, thereupon adjourned the\r\ntrial to any day he chose. The defendant and the cause were then said\r\n_ampliari_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ampulla. (Sketched by G. Scharf from a relief at\r\nAthens, discovered in 1840.)]\r\n\r\nAMPULLA (λήκυθος, βομβύλιος), a bottle, usually made among the Romans\r\neither of glass or earthenware, rarely of more valuable materials.\r\nAmpullae were more or less globular. From their round and swollen\r\nshape, the word was used by Horace to indicate grand and turgid but\r\nempty language. (“Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba,” _Ar.\r\nPoet._ 97.) Ampullae are frequently mentioned in connection with the\r\nbath, since every Roman took with him to the bath a bottle of oil for\r\nanointing the body after bathing. The dealer in bottles was called\r\n_ampullarius_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ampulla. (From a tomb at Myra in Lycia.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPYX (ἄμπυξ, ἀμπυκτήρ, Lat. _frontale_), a frontal, a broad band\r\nor plate of metal, which ladies of rank wore above the forehead as\r\npart of the head-dress. The frontal of a horse was called by the same\r\nname. The annexed cut exhibits the frontal on the head of Pegasus, in\r\ncontrast with the corresponding ornament as shown on the heads of two\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ampyces, Frontlets. (From Paintings on Vases.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂMŬLĒTUM (περίαπτον, περίαμμα, φυλακτήριον), an amulet. This word in\r\nArabic (hamalet) means _that which is suspended_. It was probably\r\nbrought into Europe by Arabian merchants, together with the articles\r\nto which it was applied. An amulet was any object,--a stone, a plant,\r\nan artificial production, or a piece of writing,--which was suspended\r\nfrom the neck, or tied to any part of the body, for the purpose of\r\nwarding off calamities and securing advantages of any kind. Faith in\r\nthe virtues of amulets was almost universal in the ancient world, so\r\nthat the art of medicine consisted in a very considerable degree of\r\ndirections for their application.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂMUSSIS or ĂMUSSĬUM, a carpenter’s and mason’s instrument, the use of\r\nwhich was to obtain a true plane surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂNĂCEIA (ἀνάκεια, or ἀνάκειον), a festival of the Dioscuri or Anactes\r\n(Ἄνακτες), as they were called at Athens. These heroes, however,\r\nreceived the most distinguished honours in the Dorian and Achaean\r\nstates, where it may be supposed that every town celebrated a\r\nfestival in their honour, though not under the name of Anaceia.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂNACRĬSIS (ἀνάκρισις), an examination, was used to signify the\r\npleadings preparatory to a trial at Athens, the object of which was\r\nto determine, generally, if the action would lie. The magistrates\r\nwere said ἀνακρίνειν τὴν δίκην or τοὺς ἀντιδίκους, and the parties\r\nἀνακρίνεσθαι. The process consisted in the production of proofs, of\r\nwhich there were five kinds:--1. The laws; 2. Written documents;\r\n3. Testimonies of witnesses present (μαρτυρίαι), or affidavits of\r\nabsent witnesses (ἐκμαρτυρίαι); 4. Depositions of slaves extorted\r\nby the rack; 5. The oath of the parties. All these proofs were\r\ncommitted to writing, and placed in a box secured by a seal (ἐχῖνος)\r\ntill they were produced at the trial. If the evidence produced at\r\nthe anacrisis was so clear and convincing that there could not\r\nremain any doubt, the magistrate could decide the question without\r\nsending the cause to be tried before the dicasts: this was called\r\n_diamartyria_ (διαμαρτυρία). The archons were the proper officers\r\nfor holding the anacrisis; they are represented by Athena (Minerva),\r\nin the _Eumenides_ of Aeschylus, where there is a poetical sketch of\r\nthe process in the law courts. For an account of the _anacrisis_ or\r\nexamination, which each archon underwent previously to entering on\r\noffice, see ARCHON.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂNĂGLỸPHA or ĂNĂGLYPTA (ἀνάγλυφα, ἀνάγλυπτα), chased or embossed\r\nvessels made of bronze or of the precious metals, which derived their\r\nname from the work on them being in relief, and not engraved.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂNĂGNOSTĒS, a slave, whose duty it was to read or repeat passages\r\nfrom books during an entertainment, and also at other times.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂNĂGŌGĬA (ἀναγώγια), a festival celebrated at Eryx, in Sicily, in\r\nhonour of Aphrodite. The inhabitants of the place believed that,\r\nduring this festival, the goddess went over into Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂNĂTŎCISMUS. [FENUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANCĪLE. [SALII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANCŎRA. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANDĂBĂTA. [GLADIATOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANDRŎGĔŌNIA (ἀνδρογεώνια), a festival with games, held every year in\r\nthe Cerameicus at Athens, in honour of the hero Androgeus, son of\r\nMinos, who had overcome all his adversaries in the festive games of\r\nthe Panathenaea, and was afterwards killed by his jealous rivals.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDRŎLEPSĬA (ἀνδροληψία or ἀνδρολήψιον), a legal means by which the\r\nAthenians were enabled to take vengeance upon a community in which an\r\nAthenian citizen had been murdered, by seizing three individuals of\r\nthat state or city, as hostages, until satisfaction was given.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDRŌNĪTIS. [DOMUS, GREEK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANGĂRĪA (ἀγγαρεία, Hdt. ἀγγαρήϊον), a word borrowed from the\r\nPersians, signifying a system of posting by relays of horses, which\r\nwas used among that people, and which, according to Xenophon, was\r\nestablished by Cyrus. The term was adopted by the Romans under the\r\nempire to signify compulsory service in forwarding the messages of\r\nthe state. The Roman _angaria_, also called _angariarum exhibitio_\r\nor _praestatio_, included the maintenance and supply, not only of\r\nhorses, but of ships and messengers, in forwarding both letters and\r\nburdens; it is defined as a _personale munus_; and there was no\r\nground of exemption from it allowed, except by the favour of the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGĬPORTUS, or ANGĬPORTUM, a narrow lane between two rows of houses,\r\nwhich might either be what the French call a _cul-de-sac_, or it\r\nmight terminate at both ends in some public street.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGUSTICLĀVĬI. [CLAVUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANNĀLES MAXĬMI. [PONTIFEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANNŌNA (from _annus_, like _pomona_ from _pomum_).--(1) The produce\r\nof the year in corn, fruit, wine, &c., and hence,--(2) provisions\r\nin general, especially the corn, which, in the later years of the\r\nrepublic, was collected in the storehouses of the state, and sold to\r\nthe poor at a cheap rate in times of scarcity; and which, under the\r\nemperors, was distributed to the people gratuitously, or given as pay\r\nand rewards;--(3) the price of provisions;--(4) a soldier’s allowance\r\nof provisions for a certain time. The word is used also in the\r\nplural for yearly or monthly distributions of pay in corn, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNŬLUS (δακτύλιος), a ring. It is probable that the custom of\r\nwearing rings was very early introduced into Greece from Asia, where\r\nit appears to have been almost universal. They were worn not merely\r\nas ornaments, but as articles for use, as the ring always served as a\r\nseal. A seal was called _sphragis_ (σφραγίς), and hence this name was\r\ngiven to the ring itself, and also to the gem or stone for a ring in\r\nwhich figures were engraved. Rings in Greece were mostly worn on the\r\nfourth finger (παράμεσος). At Rome, the custom of wearing rings was\r\nbelieved to have been introduced by the Sabines, who were described\r\nin the early legends as wearing golden rings with precious stones of\r\ngreat beauty. But, whenever introduced at Rome, it is certain that\r\nthey were at first always of iron; that they were destined for the\r\nsame purpose as in Greece, namely, to be used as seals; and that\r\nevery free Roman had a right to use such a ring. This iron ring was\r\nworn down to the last period of the republic by such men as loved the\r\nsimplicity of the good old times. In the course of time, however,\r\nit became customary for all the senators, chief magistrates, and at\r\nlast for the equites also, to wear a golden seal-ring. The right of\r\nwearing a gold ring, which was subsequently called the _jus annuli\r\naurei_, or the _jus annulorum_, remained for several centuries at\r\nRome the exclusive privilege of senators, magistrates, and equites,\r\nwhile all other persons continued to wear iron ones. During the\r\nempire the right of granting the annulus aureus belonged to the\r\nemperors, and some of them were not very scrupulous in conferring\r\nthis privilege. Augustus gave it to Mena, a freedman, and to Antonius\r\nMusa, a physician. The emperors Severus and Aurelian conferred the\r\nright of wearing golden rings upon all Roman soldiers; and Justinian\r\nat length allowed all the citizens of the empire, whether ingenui\r\nor libertini, to wear such rings. The ring of a Roman emperor was a\r\nkind of state seal, and the emperor sometimes allowed the use of it\r\nto such persons as he wished to be regarded as his representatives.\r\nDuring the republic and the early times of the empire the jus annuli\r\nseems to have made a person ingenuus (if he was a libertus), and to\r\nhave raised him to the rank of eques, provided he had the requisite\r\nequestrian census, and it was probably never granted to any one\r\nwho did not possess this census. Those who lost their property,\r\nor were found guilty of a criminal offence, lost the jus annuli.\r\nThe principal value of a ring consisted in the gem set in it, or\r\nrather in the workmanship of the engraver. The stone most frequently\r\nused was the onyx (σαρδῶνος, σαρδόνυξ), on account of its various\r\ncolours, of which the artist made the most skilful use. In the art\r\nof engraving upon gems the ancients far surpassed anything that\r\nmodern times can boast of. The devices engraved upon rings were very\r\nvarious: they were portraits of ancestors or of friends, subjects\r\nconnected with mythology; and in many cases a person had engraved\r\nupon his seal some symbolical allusion to the real or mythical\r\nhistory of his family. The bezel or part of the ring which contained\r\nthe gem was called _pala_. With the increasing love of luxury and\r\nshow, the Romans, as well as the Greeks, covered their fingers with\r\nrings. Some persons also wore rings of immoderate size, and others\r\nused different rings for summer and winter. Much superstition appears\r\nto have been connected with rings, especially in the East and in\r\nGreece. Some persons made it a lucrative trade to sell rings which\r\nwere believed to possess magic powers, and to preserve the wearers\r\nfrom external danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUS. [CALENDARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANQUĪSĪTĬO, signified, in criminal trials at Rome, the investigation\r\nof the facts of the case with reference to the penalty that was to\r\nbe imposed: accordingly the phrases _pecunia capitis_ or _capitis\r\nanquirere_ are used. Under the emperors the term _anquisitio_ lost\r\nits original meaning, and was employed to indicate an accusation\r\nin general; in which sense it also occurs even in the times of the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Temple in Antis. (Temple of Artemis at Eleusia.)]\r\n\r\nANTAE (παραστάδες), square pillars, which were commonly joined to\r\nthe side-walls of a building, being placed on each side of the door,\r\nso as to assist in forming the portico. These terms are seldom\r\nfound except in the plural; because the purpose served by antae\r\nrequired that they should be erected corresponding to each other and\r\nsupporting the extremities of the same roof. The temple _in antis_\r\nwas one of the simplest kind. It had in front antae attached to the\r\nwalls which inclosed the cella; and in the middle, between the antae,\r\ntwo columns supporting the architrave.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTĔAMBŬLŌNES, slaves who were accustomed to go before their\r\nmasters, in order to make way for them through the crowd. The term\r\n_anteambulones_ was also given to the clients, who were accustomed to\r\nwalk before their patroni, when the latter appeared in public.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTĔCESSŌRES, called also ANTĔCURSŌRES, horse-soldiers, who were\r\naccustomed to precede an army on march, in order to choose a suitable\r\nplace for the camp, and to make the necessary provisions for the\r\narmy. They do not appear to have been merely scouts, like the\r\n_speculatores_.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTĔCOENA. [COENA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTĔFIXA, terra-cottas, which exhibited various ornamental designs,\r\nand were used in architecture to cover the frieze (_zophorus_) of\r\nthe entablature. These terra-cottas do not appear to have been used\r\namong the Greeks, but were probably Etruscan in their origin, and\r\nwere thence taken for the decoration of Roman buildings. The name\r\n_antefixa_ is evidently derived from the circumstance that they were\r\n_fixed before_ the buildings which they adorned. Cato, the censor,\r\ncomplained that the Romans of his time began to despise ornaments\r\nof this description, and to prefer the marble friezes of Athens and\r\nCorinth. The rising taste which Cato deplored may account for the\r\nsuperior beauty of the antefixa preserved in the British Museum,\r\nwhich were discovered at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTENNA. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTĔPĪLĀNI. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTĔSIGNĀNI. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHESPHŎRĬA (ἀνθεσφόρια), a flower-festival, principally celebrated\r\nin Sicily, in honour of Demeter and Persephone, in commemoration of\r\nthe return of Persephone to her mother in the beginning of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHESTĒRĬA. [DIONYSIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTĬDŎSIS (ἀντίδοσις), in its literal and general meaning, “an\r\nexchange,” was, in the language of the Attic courts, peculiarly\r\napplied to proceedings under a law which is said to have originated\r\nwith Solon. By this, a citizen nominated to perform a leiturgia,\r\nsuch as a trierarchy or choregia, or to rank among the property-tax\r\npayers, in a class disproportioned to his means, was empowered to\r\ncall upon any qualified person not so charged to take the office in\r\nhis stead, or submit to a complete exchange of property, the charge\r\nin question of course attaching to the first party, if the exchange\r\nwere finally effected. For the proceedings the courts were opened\r\nat a stated time every year by the magistrates that had official\r\ncognisance of the particular subject; such as the strategi in cases\r\nof trierarchy and rating to the property-taxes, and the archon in\r\nthose of choregia.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTĬGRĂPHE (ἀντιγραφή) originally signified the writing put in by the\r\ndefendant, his “plea” in all causes whether public or private, in\r\nanswer to the indictment or bill of the prosecutor. It is, however,\r\nalso applied to the bill or indictment of the plaintiff or accuser.\r\n\r\n\r\nĀNTLĬA (ἄντλια), any machine for raising water, a pump. The most\r\nimportant of these machines were:--(1) The tympanum; a tread-wheel,\r\nworked by men treading on it.--(2) A wheel having wooden boxes\r\nor buckets, so arranged as to form steps for those who trod the\r\nwheel.--(3) The chain pump.--(4) The _cochlea_, or Archimedes’s\r\nscrew.--(5) The _ctesibica machina_, or forcing-pump.--Criminals\r\nwere condemned to the _antlia_ or tread-mill. The antlia with which\r\nMartial (ix. 19) watered his garden, was probably the pole and bucket\r\nuniversally employed in Italy, Greece, and Egypt. The pole is curved,\r\nas shown in the annexed figure; because it is the stem of a fir or\r\nsome other tapering tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antlia.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTYX (ἄντυξ), the rim or border of any thing, especially of a shield\r\nor chariot. The rim of the large round shield of the ancient Greeks\r\nwas thinner than the part which it enclosed; but on the other hand,\r\nthe antyx of a chariot must have been thicker than the body to which\r\nit gave both form and strength. In front of the chariot the antyx was\r\noften raised above the body, into the form of a curvature, which\r\nserved the purpose of a hook to hang the reins upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antyx. (From an Etruscan tomb.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPĂGŌGĒ (ἀπαγωγή), a summary process, allowed in certain cases by the\r\nAthenian law. The term denotes not merely the act of apprehending\r\na culprit caught _in ipso facto_, but also the written information\r\ndelivered to the magistrate, urging his apprehension. The cases in\r\nwhich the _apagoge_ was most generally allowed were those of theft,\r\nmurder, ill-usage of parents, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPĂTŪRĬA (ἀπατούρια) was a political festival, which the Athenians\r\nhad in common with all the Greeks of the Ionian name, with the\r\nexception of those of Colophon and Ephesus. It was celebrated in the\r\nmonth of Pyanepsion, and lasted for three days. The name ἀπατούρια\r\nis not derived from ἀπατᾶν, to deceive, but is composed of ἀ =\r\nἅμα and πατύρια, which is perfectly consistent with what Xenophon\r\nsays of the festival, that when it is celebrated the fathers and\r\nrelations assemble together. According to this derivation, it is\r\nthe festival at which the phratriae met to discuss and settle their\r\nown affairs. But, as every citizen was a member of a phratria, the\r\nfestival extended over the whole nation, who assembled _according to\r\nphratriae_. The festival lasted three days. The third day was the\r\nmost important; for on that day, children born in that year, in the\r\nfamilies of the phratriae, or such as were not yet registered, were\r\ntaken by their fathers, or in their absence by their representatives\r\n(κύριοι), before the assembled members of the phratria. For every\r\nchild a sheep or a goat was sacrificed. The father, or he who\r\nsupplied his place, was obliged to establish by oath that the child\r\nwas the offspring of free-born parents, and citizens of Athens.\r\nAfter the victim was sacrificed, the phratores gave their votes,\r\nwhich they took from the altar of Zeus Phratrius. When the majority\r\nvoted against the reception, the cause might be tried before one\r\nof the courts of Athens; and if the claims of the child were found\r\nunobjectionable, its name, as well as that of the father, was\r\nentered into the register of the phratria, and those who had wished\r\nto effect the exclusion of the child were liable to be punished.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPERTA NĀVIS. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPEX, a cap worn by the flamines and salii at Rome. The essential\r\npart of the apex, to which alone the name properly belonged, was a\r\npointed piece of olive-wood, the base of which was surrounded with\r\na lock of wool. This was worn on the top of the head, and was held\r\nthere either by fillets only, or, as was more commonly the case, by\r\nthe aid of a cap which fitted the head, and was also fastened by\r\nmeans of two strings or bands. The albogalerus, a white cap made of\r\nthe skin of a white victim sacrificed to Jupiter, and worn by the\r\nflamen dialis, had the apex fastened to it by means of an olive twig.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apices, caps worn by the Salii. (From bas-reliefs and\r\ncoins.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHLASTON (ἄφλαστον). [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPHRACTUS. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPHRŎDĪSĬA (ἀφροδίσια) were festivals celebrated in honour of\r\nAphrodité, in a great number of towns in Greece, but particularly\r\nin the island of Cyprus. Her most ancient temple was at Paphos. No\r\nbloody sacrifices were allowed to be offered to her, but only pure\r\nfire, flowers, and incense.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPLUSTRE. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPŎCLĒTI (ἀποκλητοὶ). [AETOLICUM FOEDUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPODECTAE (ἀποδέκται), public officers at Athens, who were introduced\r\nby Cleisthenes in the place of the ancient colacretae (κωλακρέται).\r\nThey were ten in number, one for each tribe, and their duty was\r\nto collect all the ordinary taxes, and distribute them among the\r\nseparate branches of the administration which were entitled to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPŎGRĂPHĒ (ἀπογραφή), literally, “a list, or register;” signified\r\nalso, (1) An accusation in public matters, more particularly when\r\nthere were several defendants. It differed but little, if at all,\r\nfrom the ordinary _graphe_.--(2) A solemn protest or assertion\r\nin writing before a magistrate, to the intent that it might be\r\npreserved by him till it was required to be given in evidence.--(3) A\r\nspecification of property, said to belong to the state, but actually\r\nin the possession of a private person; which specification was made\r\nwith a view to the confiscation of such property to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPOLLĬNĀRES LŪDI. [LUDI APOLLINARES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPOLLŌNĬA (ἀπολλώνια), the name of a propitiatory festival solemnized\r\nat Sicyon, in honour of Apollo and Artemis.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPŎPHŎRĒTA (ἀποφόρητα) were presents, which were given to friends at\r\nthe end of an entertainment to take home with them. These presents\r\nappear to have been usually given on festival days, especially during\r\nthe Saturnalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPORRHĒTA (ἀπόῤῥητα), literally “things forbidden,” has two peculiar,\r\nbut widely different, acceptations in the Attic dialect. In one of\r\nthese it implies contraband goods; in the other, it denotes certain\r\ncontumelious epithets, from the application of which both the living\r\nand the dead were protected by special laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPŎSTŎLEUS (ἀποστολεύς), the name of a public officer at Athens.\r\nThere were ten magistrates of this name, and their duty was to see\r\nthat the ships were properly equipped and provided by those who were\r\nbound to discharge the trierarchy. They had the power, in certain\r\ncases, of imprisoning the trierarchs who neglected to furnish the\r\nships properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPŎTHĒCA (ἀποθήκη), a place in the upper part of the house, in which\r\nthe Romans frequently placed the earthen amphorae in which their\r\nwines were deposited. This place, which was quite different from the\r\n_cella vinaria_, was above the _fumarium_; since it was thought that\r\nthe passage of the smoke through the room tended greatly to increase\r\nthe flavour of the wine. The position of the apotheca explains the\r\nexpression in Horace (_Carm._ ii. 21, 7), _Descende_, _testa_.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂPŎTHĔŌSIS (ἀποθέωσις), the enrolment of a mortal among the gods. The\r\nmythology of Greece contains numerous instances of the deification of\r\nmortals; but in the republican times of Greece we find few examples\r\nof such deification. The inhabitants of Amphipolis, however, offered\r\nsacrifices to Brasidas after his death. In the Greek kingdoms,\r\nwhich arose in the East on the dismemberment of the empire of\r\nAlexander, it appears to have been not uncommon for the successor\r\nto the throne to offer divine honours to the former sovereign.\r\nSuch an apotheosis of Ptolemy, king of Egypt, is described by\r\nTheocritus in his 17th Idyl. The term apotheosis, among the Romans,\r\nproperly signified the elevation of a deceased emperor to divine\r\nhonours. This practice, which was common upon the death of almost\r\nall the emperors, appears to have arisen from the opinion which was\r\ngenerally entertained among the Romans, that the souls or manes of\r\ntheir ancestors became deities; and as it was common for children\r\nto worship the manes of their fathers, so it was natural for divine\r\nhonours to be publicly paid to a deceased emperor, who was regarded\r\nas the parent of his country. This apotheosis of an emperor was\r\nusually called _consecratio_; and the emperor who received the honour\r\nof an apotheosis was usually said _in deorum numerum referri_, or\r\n_consecrari_, and whenever he is spoken of after his death, the title\r\nof _divus_ is prefixed to his name. The funeral pile on which the\r\nbody of the deceased emperor was burnt, was constructed of several\r\nstories in the form of chambers rising one above another, and in the\r\nhighest an eagle was placed, which was let loose as the fire began to\r\nburn, and which was supposed to carry the soul of the emperor from\r\nearth to heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPĀRĬTOR, the general name for a public servant of the magistrates\r\nat Rome, namely, the ACCENSUS, CARNIFEX, COACTOR, INTERPRES, LICTOR,\r\nPRAECO, SCRIBA, STATOR, VIATOR, of whom an account is given in\r\nseparate articles. They were called apparitores because they were\r\nat hand to execute the commands of the magistrates (_quod iis\r\napparebant_). Their service or attendance was called _apparitio_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPELLĀTĬO, appeal.--(1) GREEK (ἔφεσις or ἀναδικία.) Owing to the\r\nconstitution of the Athenian tribunals, each of which was generally\r\nappropriated to its peculiar subjects of cognisance, and therefore\r\ncould not be considered as homogeneous with or subordinate to any\r\nother, there was little opportunity for bringing appeals properly\r\nso called. It is to be observed also, that in general a cause was\r\nfinally and irrevocably decided by the verdict of the dicasts (δίκη\r\nαὐτοτελής). There were only a few exceptions in which appeals and\r\nnew trials might be resorted to.--(2) ROMAN. The word _appellatio_,\r\nand the corresponding verb _appellare_, are used in the early Roman\r\nwriters to express the application of an individual to a magistrate,\r\nand particularly to a tribune, in order to protect himself from some\r\nwrong inflicted, or threatened to be inflicted. It is distinguished\r\nfrom _provocatio_, which in the early writers is used to signify\r\nan appeal to the populus in a matter affecting life. It would seem\r\nthat the provocatio was an ancient right of the Roman citizens.\r\nThe surviving Horatius, who murdered his sister, appealed from the\r\nduumviri to the populus. The decemviri took away the provocatio; but\r\nit was restored by the _Lex Valeria et Horatia_, B.C. 449, in the\r\nyear after the decemvirate, and it was at the same time enacted, that\r\nin future no magistrate should be made from whom there should be no\r\nappeal. On this Livy remarks, that the plebs were now protected by\r\nthe _provocatio_ and the _tribunicium auxilium_; this latter term has\r\nreference to the appellatio properly so called. The complete phrase\r\nto express the provocatio is _provocare ad populum_; and the phrase\r\nwhich expresses the appellatio is _appellare ad_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPSIS or ABSIS (ἁψίς), in architecture, signified first, any building\r\nor portion of a building of a circular form or vaulted, and more\r\nespecially the circular and vaulted end of a Basilica.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂQUAE DUCTUS (ὑδραγωγία), literally, a water-conduit, but the word\r\nis used especially for the magnificent structures by means of which\r\nRome and other cities of the Roman empire were supplied with water.\r\nA Roman aqueduct, often called simply _aqua_, may be described in\r\ngeneral terms as a channel, constructed as nearly as possible with\r\na regular declivity from the source whence the water was derived to\r\nthe place where it was delivered, carried through hills by means of\r\ntunnels, and over valleys upon a substruction of solid masonry or\r\narches. The aqueduct is mentioned by Strabo as among the structures\r\nwhich were neglected by the Greeks, and first brought into use by\r\nthe Romans. Springs (κρῆναι, κρουνοί) were sufficiently abundant\r\nin Greece to supply the great cities with water; and they were\r\nfrequently converted into public fountains by the formation of a head\r\nfor their waters, and the erection of an ornamental superstructure.\r\nOf this we have an example in the _Enneacrunos_ at Athens, which\r\nwas constructed by Peisistratus and his sons. The Romans were in a\r\nvery different position, with respect to the supply of water, from\r\nmost of the Greek cities. They, at first, had recourse to the Tiber,\r\nand to wells sunk in the city; but the water obtained from those\r\nsources was very unwholesome, and must soon have proved insufficient,\r\nfrom the growth of the population. It was this necessity that led\r\nto the invention of aqueducts, in order to bring pure water from\r\nthe hills which surround the Campagna. The number of aqueducts was\r\ngradually increased, partly at the public expense, and partly by\r\nthe munificence of individuals, till, in the fourth century of the\r\nChristian era, they amounted to fourteen. Of these only four belong\r\nto the time of the republic, while five were built in the reigns of\r\nAugustus and Claudius.--1. The _Aqua Appia_, begun by the censor\r\nAppius Claudius Caecus in B.C. 313. Its sources were near the _Via\r\nPraenestina_, between the seventh and eighth mile-stones.--2. The\r\n_Anio Vetus_ was commenced forty years later, B.C. 273, by the censor\r\nM. Curius Dentatus, and was finished by M. Fulvius Flaccus. The\r\nwater was derived from the river Anio, above Tibur, at a distance of\r\n20 Roman miles from the city; but, on account of its windings, its\r\nactual length was 43 miles.--3. The _Aqua Marcia_, one of the most\r\nimportant of the whole, was built by the praetor Q. Marcius Rex, by\r\ncommand of the senate, in B.C. 144. It commenced at the side of the\r\n_Via Valeria_, 36 miles from Rome.--4. The _Aqua Tepula_, built by\r\nthe censors Cn. Servilius Caepio and L. Cassius Longinus in B.C.\r\n127, began at a spot in the Lucullan or Tusculan land, two miles\r\nto the right of the tenth milestone on the _Via Latina_. It was\r\nafterwards connected with.--5. The _Aqua Julia_, built by Agrippa in\r\nhis aedileship, B.C. 33. It was conducted from a source two miles\r\nto the right of the twelfth milestone on the _Via Latina_, first to\r\nthe _Aqua Tepula_, in which it was merged as far as the reservoir\r\n(_piscina_) on the _Via Latina_, seven miles from Rome. From this\r\nreservoir the water was carried along two distinct channels, on\r\nthe same substructions; the lower channel being called the _Aqua\r\nTepula_, and the upper the _Aqua Julia_; and this double aqueduct\r\nagain was united with the _Aqua Marcia_, over the watercourse of\r\nwhich the other two were carried.--6. The _Aqua Virgo_, built by\r\nAgrippa, to supply his baths. From a source in a marshy spot by the\r\n8th milestone on the _Via Collatina_, it was conducted by a very\r\ncircuitous route.--7. The _Aqua Alsietina_ (sometimes called also\r\n_Aqua Augusta_), on the other side of the Tiber, was constructed\r\nby Augustus from the _Lacus Alsietinus_ (_Lago di Martignano_),\r\nwhich lay 6500 _passus_ to the right of the 14th milestone on the\r\n_Via Claudia_.--8, 9. The two most magnificent aqueducts were the\r\n_Aqua Claudia_ and the _Anio Novus_ (or _Aqua Aniena Nova_), both\r\ncommenced by Caligula in A.D. 36, and finished by Claudius in A.D.\r\n50. The water of the _Aqua Claudia_ was derived from two copious and\r\nexcellent springs, near the 38th milestone on the _Via Sublacensis_.\r\nIts length was nearly 46½ miles. The _Anio Novus_ began at the 42nd\r\nmilestone. It was the longest and the highest of all the aqueducts,\r\nits length being nearly 59 miles, and some of its arches 109 feet\r\nhigh. In the neighbourhood of the city these two aqueducts were\r\nunited, forming two channels on the same arches, the _Claudia_\r\nbelow and the _Anio Novus_ above. These nine aqueducts were all\r\nthat existed in the time of Frontinus, who was the _curator_ of the\r\naqueducts in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan. There was also another\r\naqueduct, not reckoned with the nine, because its waters were no\r\nlonger brought all the way to Rome, viz.: 10. The _Aqua Crabra_.--The\r\nfollowing were of later construction. 11. The _Aqua Trajana_, brought\r\nby Trajan from the _Lacus Sabatinus_ (now _Bracciano_).--12. The\r\n_Aqua Alexandrina_, constructed by Alexander Severus; its source was\r\nin the lands of Tusculum, about 14 miles from Rome.--13. The _Aqua\r\nSeptimiana_, built by Septimius Severus, was perhaps only a branch\r\nof the _Aqua Julia_.--14. The _Aqua Algentia_ had its source at _M.\r\nAlgidus_ by the _Via Tusculana_. Its builder is unknown.--Great\r\npains were taken by successive emperors to preserve and repair the\r\naqueducts. From the Gothic wars downwards, they have for the most\r\npart shared the fate of the other great Roman works of architecture;\r\ntheir situation and purpose rendering them peculiarly exposed to\r\ninjury in war; but still their remains form the most striking\r\nfeatures of the Campagna, over which their lines of ruined arches,\r\nclothed with ivy and the wild fig-tree, radiate in various directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Triple Aqueduct.]\r\n\r\nThree of them still serve for their ancient use. They are--(1.) The\r\n_Acqua Vergine_, the ancient _Aqua Virgo_. (2.) The _Acqua Felice_,\r\nnamed after the conventual name of its restorer Sixtus V. (Fra\r\nFelice), is, probably, a part of the ancient _Aqua Claudia_, though\r\nsome take it for the _Alexandrina_. (3.) The _Acqua Paola_, the\r\nancient _Alsietina_.--The following woodcut represents a restored\r\nsection of the triple aqueduct of Agrippa:--_a._ the _Aqua Marcia_;\r\n_b._ the _Aqua Tepula_; _c._ the _Aqua Julia_. The two latter are of\r\nbrick and vaulted over. The air-vents are also shown.--The channel\r\nof an aqueduct (_specus_, _canalis_) was a trough of brick or stone,\r\nlined with cement, and covered with a coping, which was almost always\r\narched; and the water either ran directly through this trough, or\r\nit was carried through pipes laid along the trough. These pipes\r\nwere of lead, or terra-cotta (_fictiles_), and sometimes, for the\r\nsake of economy, of leather. At convenient points on the course of\r\nthe aqueduct, and especially near the middle and end, there was\r\ngenerally a reservoir (_piscina_, _piscina limosa_) in which the\r\nwater might deposit any sediment that it contained. The water was\r\nreceived, when it reached the walls of the city, in a vast reservoir\r\ncalled _castellum_, which formed the _head of water_ and also served\r\nthe purpose of a _meter_. From this principal _castellum_ the water\r\nflowed into other _castella_, whence it was distributed for public\r\nand private use. The term _castellum_ is sometimes also applied to\r\nthe intermediate reservoirs already mentioned. During the republic,\r\nthe censors and aediles had the superintendence of the aqueducts.\r\nAugustus first established _curatores_ (or _praefecti_) _aquarum_,\r\nwho were invested with considerable authority. They were attended\r\noutside the city by two lictors, three public slaves, a secretary,\r\nand other attendants. In the time of Nerva and Trajan, 460 slaves\r\nwere constantly employed under the orders of the _curatores aquarum_\r\nin attending to the aqueducts. They consisted of:--1. The _villici_,\r\nwhose duty it was to attend to the pipes and _calices_. 2. The\r\n_castellarii_, who had the superintendence of all the _castella_,\r\nboth within and without the city. 3. The _circuitores_, so called\r\nbecause they had to go from post to post, to examine into the state\r\nof the works, and also to keep watch over the labourers employed\r\nupon them. 4. The _silicarii_, or paviours. 5. The _tectores_, or\r\nmasons. These and other workmen appear to have been included under\r\nthe general term of AQUARII.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂQUAE ET IGNIS INTERDICTĬO. [EXSILIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂQUĀRĬI, slaves who carried water for bathing, &c., into the female\r\napartments. The aquarii were also public officers who attended to the\r\naqueducts. [AQUAE DUCTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂQUĬLA. [SIGNA MILITARIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arae, Altars.]\r\n\r\nĀRA (βωμός, θυτήριον), an altar. _Ara_ was a general term denoting\r\nany structure elevated above the ground, and used to receive upon\r\nit offerings made to the gods. _Altare_, probably contracted from\r\n_alta ara_, was properly restricted to the larger, higher, and\r\nmore expensive structures. Four specimens of ancient altars are\r\ngiven below; the two in the former woodcut are square, and those\r\nin the latter round, which is the less common form. At the top of\r\nthree of the above altars we see the hole intended to receive the\r\nfire (ἐσχαρίς, ἐσχάρα): the fourth was probably intended for the\r\noffering of fruits or other gifts, which were presented to the gods\r\nwithout fire. When the altars were prepared for sacrifice, they were\r\ncommonly decorated with garlands or festoons. These were composed\r\nof certain kinds of leaves and flowers, which were considered\r\nconsecrated to such uses, and were called _verbenae_. The altars\r\nconstructed with most labour and skill belonged to temples; and they\r\nwere erected either before the temple or within the cella of the\r\ntemple, and principally before the statue of the divinity to whom\r\nit was dedicated. The altars in the area before the temple were\r\naltars of burnt-offerings, at which animal sacrifices (_victimae_,\r\nσφάγια, ἱερεῖα) were presented: only incense was burnt, or cakes and\r\nbloodless sacrifices offered on the altars within the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arae, Altars.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂRĀTRUM (ἄροτρον), a plough. Among the Greeks and Romans the three\r\nmost essential parts of the plough were,--the plough-tail (γύης,\r\n_buris_, _bura_), the share-beam (ἔλυμα, _dens_, _dentale_), that\r\nis, the piece of wood to which the share is fixed, and the pole\r\n(ῥυμός], ἱστοβοεύς, _temo_). In the time and country of Virgil\r\nit was the custom to force a tree into the crooked form of the\r\n_buris_, or plough-tail. The upper end of the _buris_ being held by\r\nthe ploughman, the lower part, below its junction with the pole,\r\nwas used to hold the _dentale_ or share-beam, which was either\r\nsheathed with metal, or driven bare into the ground, according to\r\ncircumstances. The term _vomer_ was sometimes applied to the end of\r\nthe _dentale_. To these three parts, the two following are added in\r\nthe description of the plough by Virgil:--1. The _earth-boards_, or\r\n_mould-boards_ (_aures_), rising on each side, bending outwardly in\r\nsuch a manner as to throw on either hand the soil which had been\r\npreviously loosened and raised by the share, and adjusted to the\r\nshare-beam (_dentale_), which was made double for the purpose of\r\nreceiving them. 2. The _handle_ (_stiva_). Virgil describes this\r\npart as used to turn the plough at the end of the furrow; and it is\r\ndefined by an ancient commentator on Virgil as the “handle by which\r\nthe plough is directed.” It is probable that as the _dentalia_,\r\nthe two share-beams, were in the form of the Greek letter Λ, which\r\nVirgil describes by _duplici dorso_, the _buris_ was fastened to the\r\nleft share-beam and the _stiva_ to the right, so that the plough of\r\nVirgil was more like the modern Lancashire plough, which is commonly\r\nheld behind with both hands. Sometimes, however, the _stiva_ was\r\nused alone and instead of the _buris_ or tail. In place of _stiva_\r\nthe term _capulus_ is sometimes employed. The only other part of the\r\nplough requiring notice is the coulter (_culter_), which was used by\r\nthe Romans as it is with us. It was inserted into the pole so as to\r\ndepend vertically before the share, cutting through the roots which\r\ncame in its way, and thus preparing for the more complete overturning\r\nof the soil by the share. Two small wheels were also added to some\r\nploughs. The plough, as described by Virgil, corresponds in all\r\nessential particulars with the plough now used about Mantua and\r\nVenice. The Greeks and Romans usually ploughed their land three\r\ntimes for each crop. The first ploughing was called _proscindere_,\r\nor _novare_ (νεοῦσθαι, νεάζεσθαι); the second _offringere_, or\r\n_iterare_; and the third, _lirare_, or _tertiare_. The field which\r\nunderwent the “proscissio” was called _vervactum_ or _novale_\r\n(νεός), and in this process the coulter was employed, because the\r\nfresh surface was entangled with numberless roots which required\r\nto be divided before the soil could be turned up by the share. The\r\nterm “_offringere_” from _ob_ and _frangere_, was applied to the\r\nsecond ploughing; because the long parallel clods already turned\r\nup were broken and cut across, by drawing the plough through them\r\nat right angles to its former direction. The field which underwent\r\nthis process was called _ager iteratus_. After the second ploughing\r\nthe sower cast his seed. Also the clods were often, though not\r\nalways, broken still further by a wooden mallet, or by harrowing\r\n(_occatio_). The Roman ploughman then, for the first time, attached\r\nthe earth-boards to his share. The effect of this adjustment was\r\nto divide the level surface of the “ager _iteratus_” into ridges.\r\nThese were called _porcae_, and also _lirae_, whence came the verb\r\n_lirare_, to make ridges, and also _delirare_, to decline from the\r\nstraight line. The earth-boards, by throwing the earth to each side\r\nin the manner already explained, both covered the newly-scattered\r\nseed, and formed between the ridges furrows (αὔλακες, _sulci_) for\r\ncarrying off the water. In this state the field was called _seges_\r\nand τρίπολος. When the ancients ploughed three times only, it was\r\ndone in the spring, summer, and autumn of the same year. But in\r\norder to obtain a still heavier crop, both the Greeks and the Romans\r\nploughed four times, the proscissio being performed in the latter\r\npart of the preceding year, so that between one crop and another two\r\nwhole years intervened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aratrum, Plough (now used at Mantua).\r\n\r\n  1.

(1) A chest, in which the Romans were accustomed to\r\nplace their money; and the phrase _ex arca solvere_ had the meaning\r\nof paying in ready money. The term arcae was usually applied to\r\nthe chests in which the rich kept their money, and was opposed to\r\nthe smaller _loculi_, _sacculus_, and _crumena_.--(2) The coffin\r\nin which persons were buried, or the bier on which the corpse was\r\nplaced previously to burial.--(3) A strong cell made of oak, in which\r\ncriminals and slaves were confined.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCĔRA, a covered carriage or litter, spread with cloths, which\r\nwas used in ancient times in Rome, to carry the aged and infirm.\r\nIt is said to have obtained the name of arcera on account of its\r\nresemblance to an arca, or chest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arcera. (Ginzrot, Wagen, Tav. 19, fig. 2.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHEION (ἀρχεῖον) properly means any public place belonging to\r\nthe magistrates, but is more particularly applied to the archive\r\noffice, where the decrees of the people and other state documents\r\nwere preserved. This office is sometimes merely called τὸ δημοσίον.\r\nAt Athens the archives were kept in the temple of the mother of the\r\ngods (μήτρῳον), and the charge of it was entrusted to the president\r\n(ἐπιστάτης) of the senate of the Five-hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHĬĀTER (ἀρχίατρος), a medical title under the Roman emperors, the\r\nexact signification of which has been the subject of much discussion,\r\nbut which most probably means “the chief of the physicians.” The\r\nfirst person whom we find bearing this title is Andromachus,\r\nphysician to Nero. In after times the order appears to have been\r\ndivided, and we find two distinct classes of archiatri, viz., those\r\nof the palace and those of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHĬMĪMUS. [MIMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHĬTECTŪRA (ἀρχιτεκτονία, ἀρχιτεκτονική), architecture. The\r\nnecessity for a habitation, and the attempt to adorn those\r\nhabitations which were intended for the gods, are the two causes\r\nfrom which the art derives its existence. In early times little\r\nattention was paid to domestic architecture. The resources of the\r\nart were lavished upon the temples of the gods; and hence the\r\ngreater part of the history of Grecian architecture is inseparably\r\nconnected with that of the temple, and has its proper place under\r\nTEMPLUM, and the subordinate headings, such as COLUMNA, &c. But,\r\nthough the first rise of architecture, as a fine art, is connected\r\nwith the temple, yet, viewed as the science of construction, it must\r\nhave been employed, even earlier, for other purposes, such as the\r\nerection of fortifications, palaces, treasuries, and other works of\r\nutility. Accordingly, it is the general opinion of antiquaries, that\r\nthe very earliest edifices, of which we have any remains, are the\r\nso-called Cyclopean works, in which we see huge unsquared blocks of\r\nstone built together in the best way that their shapes would allow.\r\n[MURUS.] In addition to these, however, there are other purposes\r\nfor which architecture, still using the term in its lower sense,\r\nwould be required in a very early stage of political society; such\r\nas the general arrangement of cities, the provision of a place for\r\nthe transaction of public business, with the necessary edifices\r\nappertaining to it [AGORA, FORUM], and the whole class of works which\r\nwe embrace under the head of civil engineering, such as those for\r\ndrainage [CLOACA, EMISSARIUS], for communication [VIA, PONS], and\r\nfor the supply of water [AQUAE DUCTUS]. Almost equally necessary are\r\nplaces devoted to public exercise, health, and amusement, GYMNASIUM,\r\nSTADIUM, HIPPODROMUS, CIRCUS, BALNEUM, THEATRUM, AMPHITHEATRUM.\r\nLastly, the skill of the architect has been from the earliest times\r\nemployed to preserve the memory of departed men and past events;\r\nand hence we have the various works of monumental and triumphal\r\narchitecture, which are described under the heads FUNUS, ARCUS,\r\nCOLUMNA. The history of architecture may be divided into five\r\nperiods. The first, which is chiefly mythical, comes down to the\r\ntime of Cypselus, Ol. 30, B.C. 660: the second period comes down to\r\nthe termination of the Persian war, Ol. 75. 2, B.C. 478: the third\r\nis the brilliant period from the end of the Persian war to the death\r\nof Alexander the Great, Ol. 114, B.C. 323: the fourth period extends\r\nto the battle of Actium, B.C. 31: the fifth period embraces the\r\narchitecture of the Roman empire till it became mingled with the\r\nGothic. Strongly fortified cities, palaces, and treasuries are the\r\nchief works of the earlier part of the first period; and to it may\r\nbe referred most of the so-called Cyclopean remains; while the era\r\nof the Dorian invasion marks, in all probability, the commencement\r\nof the Dorian style of temple architecture. In the second period\r\nthe art made rapid advances under the powerful patronage of the\r\naristocracies in some cities, as at Sparta, and of the tyrants in\r\nothers, as Cypselus at Corinth, Theagnes at Megara, Cleisthenes\r\nat Sicyon, the Peisistratids at Athens, and Polycrates at Samos.\r\nArchitecture now assumed decidedly the character of a fine art, and\r\nbecame associated with the sister arts of sculpture and painting,\r\nwhich are essential to its development. Magnificent temples sprung\r\nup in all the principal Greek cities; and while the Doric order was\r\nbrought almost, if not quite, to perfection, in Greece Proper, in\r\nthe Doric colonies of Asia Minor, and in Central Italy and Sicily,\r\nthe Ionic order appeared, already perfect at its first invention, in\r\nthe great temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The ruins still existing at\r\nPaestum, Syracuse, Agrigentum, Selinus, Aegina, and other places,\r\nare imperishable monuments of this period. To it also belong the\r\ngreat works of the Roman kings. The commencement of the third and\r\nmost brilliant period of the art was signalized by the rebuilding of\r\nAthens, the establishment of regular principles for the laying out\r\nof cities by Hippodamus of Miletus, and the great works of the age\r\nof Pericles, by the contemporaries of Phidias, at Athens, Eleusis,\r\nand Olympia. The first part of the fourth period saw the extension\r\nof the Greek architecture over the countries conquered by Alexander,\r\nand, in the West, the commencement of the new style, which arose from\r\nthe imitation, with some alterations, of the Greek forms by Roman\r\narchitects, to which the conquest of Greece gave, of course, a new\r\nimpulse. By the time of Augustus, Rome was adorned with every kind\r\nof public and private edifice, surrounded by villas, and furnished\r\nwith roads and aqueducts; and these various erections were adorned by\r\nthe forms of Grecian art; but already Vitruvius begins to complain\r\nthat the purity of that art is corrupted by the intermixture of\r\nheterogeneous forms. This process of deterioration went on rapidly\r\nduring the fifth period, though combined at first with increasing\r\nmagnificence in the scale and number of the buildings erected. The\r\nearly part of this period is made illustrious by the numerous works\r\nof Augustus and his successors, especially the Flavii, Nerva, Trajan,\r\nHadrian, and the Antonines, at Rome and in the provinces; but from\r\nthe time of the Antonines the decline of the art was rapid and\r\ndecided. In one department a new impulse was given to architecture\r\nby the rise of Christian churches, which were generally built on the\r\nmodel of the Roman Basilica. One of the most splendid specimens of\r\nChristian architecture is the church of S. Sophia at Constantinople,\r\nbuilt in the reign of Justinian, A.D. 537, and restored, after its\r\npartial destruction by an earthquake, in 554. But, long before this\r\ntime, the Greco-Roman style had become thoroughly corrupted, and\r\nthat new style, which is called the Byzantine, had arisen out of the\r\nmixture of Roman architecture with ideas derived from the Northern\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITHĔŌRUS (ἀρχιθέωρος). [DELIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHON (ἄρχων). The government of Athens began with monarchy,\r\nand, after passing through a dynasty[1] and aristocracy, ended in\r\ndemocracy. Of the kings of Athens, considered as the capital of\r\nAttica, Theseus may be said to have been the first; for to him,\r\nwhether as a real individual or a representative of a certain period,\r\nis attributed the union of the different and independent states of\r\nAttica under one head. The last was Codrus; in acknowledgment of\r\nwhose patriotism in meeting death for his country, the Athenians\r\nare said to have determined that no one should succeed him with the\r\ntitle of king (βασιλεύς). It seems, however, equally probable that\r\nit was the nobles who availed themselves of the opportunity to serve\r\ntheir own interests, by abolishing the kingly power for another, the\r\npossessors of which they called _Archontes_ (ἄρχοντες) or rulers.\r\nThese for some time continued to be like the kings of the house of\r\nCodrus, appointed for life: still an important point was gained by\r\nthe nobles, the office being made accountable (ὑπεύθυνος), which of\r\ncourse implies that the nobility had some control over it. This state\r\nof things lasted for twelve reigns of archons. The next step was to\r\nlimit the continuance of the office to ten years, still confining\r\nit to the Medontidae, or house of Codrus, so as to establish what\r\nthe Greeks called a dynasty, till the archonship of Eryxias, the\r\nlast archon of that family elected as such. At the end of his ten\r\nyears (B.C. 684), a much greater change took place: the archonship\r\nwas made annual, and its various duties divided among a college\r\nof nine, chosen by suffrage (χειροτονία) from the Eupatridae, or\r\nPatricians, and no longer elected from the Medontidae exclusively.\r\nThis arrangement lasted till the time of Solon, who still continued\r\nthe election by suffrage, but made the qualification for office\r\ndepend, not on birth, but property. The election by lot is believed\r\nto have been introduced by Cleisthenes (B.C. 508). The last change\r\nis supposed to have been made by Aristides, who after the battle of\r\nPlataeae (B.C. 479) abolished the property qualification, throwing\r\nopen the archonship and other magistracies to all the citizens; that\r\nis, to the Thetes, as well as the other classes, the former of whom\r\nwere not allowed by Solon’s laws to hold any magistracy at all.\r\nStill, after the removal of the old restrictions, some security was\r\nleft to insure respectability; for, previously to an archon entering\r\non office, he underwent an examination, called the _anacrisis_\r\n(ἀνάκρισις), as to his being a legitimate and a good citizen, a good\r\nson, and qualified in point of property, but the latter limitation\r\nwas either done away with by Aristides, or soon became obsolete. Yet,\r\neven after passing a satisfactory _anacrisis_, each of the archons,\r\nin common with other magistrates, was liable to be deposed on\r\ncomplaint of misconduct made before the people, at the first regular\r\nassembly in each prytany. On such an occasion the _epicheirotonia_\r\n(ἐπιχειροτονία), as it was called, took place: and we read that\r\nin one case the whole college of archons was deprived of office\r\n(ἀποχειροτονεῖσθαι). In consequence of the democratical tendency of\r\nthe assembly and courts of justice established by Solon, the archons\r\nlost the great political power which they at one time possessed.\r\nThey became, in fact, not as of old directors of the government,\r\nbut merely municipal magistrates, exercising functions and bearing\r\ntitles described below. It has been already stated, that the duties\r\nof the single archon were shared by a college of nine. The first, or\r\npresident of this body, was called _Archon_, by way of pre-eminence,\r\nor _Archon Eponymus_ (ἄρχων ἐπώνυμος), from the year being\r\ndistinguished by and registered in his name. The second was styled\r\n_Archon Basileus_ (ἄρχων βασιλεύς), or the King Archon; the third\r\n_Polemarchus_ (πολέμαρχος), or commander-in-chief; the remaining\r\nsix, _Thesmothetae_ (θεσμοθέται), or legislators. As regards the\r\nduties of the archons, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish\r\nwhat belonged to them individually, and what collectively. It\r\nseems that a considerable portion of the judicial functions of the\r\nancient kings devolved upon the _Archon Eponymus_, who was also\r\nconstituted a sort of state protector of those who were unable to\r\ndefend themselves. Thus he was to superintend orphans, heiresses,\r\nfamilies losing their representatives, widows left pregnant, and\r\nto see that they were not wronged in any way. This archon had also\r\nthe superintendence of the greater Dionysia, and the Thargelia.\r\nThe functions of the _King Archon_ were almost all connected with\r\nreligion; his distinguishing title shows that he was considered a\r\nrepresentative of the old kings in their capacity of high priest, as\r\nthe Rex Sacrificulus was at Rome. Thus he presided at the Lenaea,\r\nor older Dionysia; superintended the mysteries and the games called\r\n_Lampadephoriae_, and had to offer up sacrifices and prayers in the\r\nEleusinium, both at Athens and Eleusis. Moreover, indictments for\r\nimpiety, and controversies about the priesthood, were laid before\r\nhim; and, in cases of murder, he brought the trial into the court of\r\nthe areiopagus, and voted with its members. His wife, also, who was\r\ncalled _Basilissa_ (βασίλισσα), had to offer certain sacrifices, and\r\ntherefore it was required that she should be a citizen of pure blood,\r\nwithout stain or blemish. The _Polemarch_ was originally, as his name\r\ndenotes, the commander-in-chief, and we find him discharging military\r\nduties as late as the battle of Marathon, in conjunction with the ten\r\n_Strategi_; he there took, like the kings of old, the command of the\r\nright wing of the army. This, however, seems to be the last occasion\r\non record of this magistrate appointed by lot being invested with\r\nsuch important functions; and in after ages we find that his duties\r\nceased to be military, having been, in a great measure, transferred\r\nto the protection and superintendence of the resident aliens, so that\r\nhe resembled in many respects the praetor peregrinus at Rome. Thus,\r\nall actions affecting aliens, the isoteles and proxeni were brought\r\nbefore him previously to trial. Moreover, it was the polemarch’s\r\nduty to offer the yearly sacrifice to Artemis, in commemoration of\r\nthe vow made by Callimachus, at Marathon, and to arrange the funeral\r\ngames in honour of those who fell in war. The six _Thesmothetae_ were\r\nextensively connected with the administration of justice, and appear\r\nto have been called legislators, because, in the absence of a written\r\ncode, they might be said to make laws, or _thesmi_ (θεσμοί), in the\r\nancient language of Athens, though in reality they only explained\r\nthem. They were required to review, every year, the whole body of\r\nlaws, that they might detect any inconsistencies or superfluities,\r\nand discover whether any laws which were abrogated were in the public\r\nrecords amongst the rest. Their report was submitted to the people,\r\nwho referred the necessary alterations to a legislative committee\r\nchosen for the purpose, and called _Nomothetae_ (νομοθέται). The\r\nchief part of the duties of the thesmothetae consisted in receiving\r\ninformations, and bringing cases to trial in the courts of law, of\r\nthe days of sitting in which they gave public notice. They did not\r\ntry them themselves, but seem to have constituted a sort of grand\r\njury, or inquest. The trial itself took place before the Dicastae.\r\n[DICASTAE.] It is necessary to be cautious in our interpretation of\r\nthe words ἀρχή and ἄρχοντες, since they have a double meaning in\r\nthe Attic orators, sometimes referring to the archons peculiarly\r\nso called, and sometimes to any other magistracy. The archons had\r\nvarious privileges and honours. The greatest of the former was the\r\nexemption from the trierarchies--a boon not allowed even to the\r\nsuccessors of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. As a mark of their office,\r\nthey wore a chaplet or crown of myrtle; and if any one struck or\r\nabused one of the archons, when wearing this badge of office, he\r\nbecame _atimus_ (ἄτιμος), or infamous in the fullest extent, thereby\r\nlosing his civic rights. The archons, at the close of their year\r\nof service, were admitted among the members of the areiopagus.\r\n[AREIOPAGUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] By this is meant that the supreme power, though not monarchical,\r\nwas confined to one family.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arch of Tiryns. (Gell’s Itinerary, pl. 16.)]\r\n\r\nARCUS (also fornix), an arch. A true arch is formed of a series\r\nof wedge-like stones, or of bricks, supporting each other, and\r\nall bound firmly together by their mutual pressure. It would seem\r\nthat the arch, as thus defined, and as used by the Romans, was not\r\nknown to the Greeks in the early periods of their history. But they\r\nmade use of a contrivance, even in the heroic age, by which they\r\nwere enabled to gain all the advantages of our archway in making\r\ncorridors, or hollow galleries, and which in appearance resembled\r\nthe pointed arch, such as is now termed Gothic. This was effected\r\nby cutting away the superincumbent stones in the manner already\r\ndescribed, at an angle of about 45° with the horizon. The mode of\r\nconstruction and appearance of such arches is represented in the\r\nannexed drawing of the walls of Tiryns. The gate of Signia (_Segni_)\r\nin Latium exhibits a similar example. The principle of the true arch\r\nseems to have been known to the Romans from the earliest period;\r\nit is used in the _Cloaca Maxima_. It is most probably an Etruscan\r\ninvention. The use of it constitutes one leading distinction between\r\nGreek and Roman architecture, for by its application the Romans were\r\nenabled to execute works of far bolder construction than those of\r\nthe Greeks. The Romans, however, never used any other form of arch\r\nthan the semicircle. The arcus triumphalis, triumphal arch, was a\r\nstructure peculiar to the Romans, erected in honour of an individual,\r\nor in commemoration of a conquest. Triumphal arches were built\r\nacross the principal streets of Rome, and, according to the space\r\nof their respective localities, consisted of a single archway, or\r\na central one for carriages, and two smaller ones on each side for\r\nfoot-passengers. Those actually made use of on the occasion of a\r\ntriumphal entry and procession were merely temporary and hastily\r\nerected; and, having served their purpose, were taken down again, and\r\nsometimes replaced by others of more durable materials. Stertinius\r\nis the first upon record who erected anything of the kind. He built\r\nan arch in the Forum Boarium, about B.C. 196, and another in the\r\nCircus Maximus, each of which was surmounted by gilt statues. There\r\nare twenty-one arches recorded by different writers, as having been\r\nerected in the city of Rome, five of which now remain:--1. _Arcus\r\nDrusi_, which was erected to the honour of Claudius Drusus on the\r\nAppian way. 2. _Arcus Titi_, at the foot of the Palatine, which\r\nwas erected to the honour of Titus, after his conquest of Judaea;\r\nthe bas-reliefs of this arch represent the spoils from the temple\r\nof Jerusalem carried in triumphal procession. 3. _Arcus Septimii\r\nSeveri_, which was erected by the senate (A.D. 207) at the end of\r\nthe Via Sacra, in honour of that emperor and his two sons, Caracalla\r\nand Geta, on account of his conquest of the Parthians and Arabians.\r\n4. _Arcus Gallieni_, erected to the honour of Gallienus by a private\r\nindividual, M. Aurelius Victor. 5. _Arcus Constantini_, which was\r\nlarger than the arch of Titus. As a specimen of the triumphal arches,\r\na drawing of the arch of Drusus is given in the preceding page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arch of Drusus at Rome]\r\n\r\n\r\nARCUS (βιός, τόξον), the bow used for shooting arrows, is one of the\r\nmost ancient of all weapons, but is characteristic of Asia rather\r\nthan of Europe. In the Roman armies it was scarcely ever employed\r\nexcept by auxiliaries; and these auxiliaries, called _sagittarii_,\r\nwere chiefly Cretes and Arabians. The upper of the two figures below\r\nshows the Scythian or Parthian bow unstrung; the lower one represents\r\nthe usual form of the Grecian bow, which had a double curvature,\r\nconsisting of two circular portions united by the handle. When not\r\nused, the bow was put into a case (τοξοθήκη, γωρυτός, _corytus_),\r\nwhich was made of leather, and sometimes ornamented. It frequently\r\nheld the arrows as well as the bow, and on this account is often\r\nconfounded with the _pharetra_ or quiver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arcus, Bow. (From paintings on vases.)\r\n\r\nCorytus, Bow-case. (From a Relief in the Vatican, Visconti, iv.\r\ntav. 43.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nĀRĔA (ἅλως, or ἁλωά), the threshing-floor, was a raised place in the\r\nfield, open on all sides to the wind. Great pains were taken to make\r\nthis floor hard; it was sometimes paved with flint stones, but more\r\nusually covered with clay and smoothed with a roller.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂREIOPĂGUS (ὁ Ἄρειος πάγος, or hill of Ares) was a rocky eminence,\r\nlying to the west of, and not far from the Acropolis at Athens. It\r\nwas the place of meeting of the council (Ἡ ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ βουλή),\r\nwhich was sometimes called _The Upper Council_ (Ἡ ἄνω βουλή), to\r\ndistinguish it from the senate of Five-hundred, which sat in the\r\nCerameicus within the city. It was a body of very remote antiquity,\r\nacting as a criminal tribunal, and existed long before the time\r\nof Solon, but he so far modified its constitution and sphere of\r\nduty, that he may almost be called its founder. What that original\r\nconstitution was, must in some degree be left to conjecture, though\r\nthere is every reason to suppose that it was aristocratical, the\r\nmembers being taken, like the ephetae, from the noble patrician\r\nfamilies. [EPHETAE.] By the legislation of Solon the Areiopagus was\r\ncomposed of the ex-archons, who, after an unexceptionable discharge\r\nof their duties, “went up” to the Areiopagus, and became members\r\nof it for life, unless expelled for misconduct. As Solon made the\r\nqualification for the office of archon to depend not on birth but\r\non property, the council after his time ceased to be aristocratic\r\nin constitution; but, as we learn from Attic writers, continued so\r\nin spirit. In fact, Solon is said to have formed the two councils,\r\nthe senate and the Areiopagus, to be a check upon the democracy;\r\nthat, as he himself expressed it, “the state riding upon them as\r\nanchors might be less tossed by storms.” Nay, even after the archons\r\nwere no longer elected by suffrage, but by lot, and the office was\r\nthrown open by Aristides to all the Athenian citizens, the “upper\r\ncouncil” still retained its former tone of feeling. Moreover, besides\r\nthese changes in its constitution, Solon altered and extended its\r\nfunctions. Before his time it was only a criminal court, trying cases\r\nof “wilful murder and wounding, of arson and poisoning,” whereas he\r\ngave it extensive powers of a censorial and political nature. Thus\r\nwe learn that he made the council an “overseer of everything, and\r\nthe guardian of the laws,” empowering it to inquire how any one got\r\nhis living and to punish the idle; and we are also told that the\r\nAreiopagites were “superintendents of good order and decency,” terms\r\nas unlimited and undefined as Solon not improbably wished to leave\r\ntheir authority. When heinous crimes had notoriously been committed,\r\nbut the guilty parties were not known, or no accuser appeared, the\r\nAreiopagus inquired into the subject, and reported to the demus. The\r\nreport or information was called _apophasis_. This was a duty which\r\nthey sometimes undertook on their own responsibility, and in the\r\nexercise of an old established right, and sometimes on the order of\r\nthe demus. Nay, to such an extent did they carry their power, that\r\non one occasion they apprehended an individual (Antiphon), who had\r\nbeen acquitted by the general assembly, and again brought him to a\r\ntrial, which ended in his condemnation and death. Again, we find them\r\nrevoking an appointment whereby Aeschines was made the advocate of\r\nAthens before the Amphictyonic council, and substituting Hyperides\r\nin his room. They also had duties connected with religion, one of\r\nwhich was to superintend the sacred olives growing about Athens, and\r\ntry those who were charged with destroying them; and in general it\r\nwas their office to punish the impious and irreligious. Independent,\r\nthen, of its jurisdiction as a criminal court in cases of wilful\r\nmurder, which Solon continued to the Areiopagus, its influence must\r\nhave been sufficiently great to have been a considerable obstacle\r\nto the aggrandisement of the democracy at the expense of the other\r\nparties in the state. Accordingly, we find that Pericles, who was\r\nopposed to the aristocracy, resolved to diminish its power and\r\ncircumscribe its sphere of action. His coadjutor in this work was\r\nEphialtes, a statesman of inflexible integrity, and also a military\r\ncommander. They experienced much opposition in their attempts, not\r\nonly in the assembly, but also on the stage, where Aeschylus produced\r\nhis tragedy of the Eumenides, the object of which was to impress upon\r\nthe Athenians the dignity, sacredness, and constitutional worth of\r\nthe institution which Pericles and Ephialtes wished to reform. Still\r\nthe opposition failed: a decree was carried by which, as Aristotle\r\nsays, the Areiopagus was “mutilated,” and many of its hereditary\r\nrights abolished, though it is difficult to ascertain the precise\r\nnature of the alterations which Pericles effected. The jurisdiction\r\nof the Areiopagus in cases of murder was still left to them. In such\r\ncases the process was as follows:--The king archon brought the case\r\ninto court, and sat as one of the judges, who were assembled in\r\nthe open air, probably to guard against any contamination from the\r\ncriminal. The accuser first came forwards to make a solemn oath that\r\nhis accusation was true, standing over the slaughtered victims, and\r\nimprecating extirpation upon himself and his whole family were it\r\nnot so. The accused then denied the charge with the same solemnity\r\nand form of oath. Each party then stated his case with all possible\r\nplainness, keeping strictly to the subject, and not being allowed\r\nto appeal in any way to the feelings or passions of the judges.\r\nAfter the first speech, a criminal accused of murder might remove\r\nfrom Athens, and thus avoid the capital punishment fixed by Draco’s\r\n_Thesmi_, which on this point were still in force. Except in cases\r\nof parricide, neither the accuser nor the court had power to prevent\r\nthis; but the party who thus evaded the extreme punishment was not\r\nallowed to return home, and when any decree was passed at Athens to\r\nlegalize the return of exiles, an exception was always made against\r\nthose who had thus left their country. The Areiopagus continued\r\nto exist, in name at least, till a very late period. Thus we find\r\nCicero mentioning the council in his letters; and an individual is\r\nspoken of as an Areiopagite under the emperors Gratian and Theodosius\r\n(A.D. 380). The case of St. Paul is generally quoted as an instance\r\nof the authority of the Areiopagus in religious matters; but the\r\nwords of the sacred historian do not necessarily imply that he was\r\nbrought before the council. It may, however, be remarked, that the\r\nAreiopagites certainly took cognizance of the introduction of new\r\nand unauthorised forms of religious worship, called ἐπίθετα ἱερά, in\r\ncontradistinction to the πάτρια or older rites of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂRĒNA. [AMPHITHEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂRĔTĀLŎGI, persons who amused the company at the Roman dinner tables.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGĒI, the name given by the pontifices to the places consecrated\r\nby Numa for the celebration of religious services. Varro calls them\r\nthe chapels of the argei, and says they were twenty-seven in number,\r\ndistributed in the different districts of the city. There was a\r\ntradition that these argei were named from the chieftains who came\r\nwith Hercules, the Argive, to Rome, and occupied the Capitoline,\r\nor, as it was anciently called, Saturnian hill. It is impossible\r\nto say what is the historical value or meaning of this legend; we\r\nmay, however, notice its conformity with the statement that Rome was\r\nfounded by the Pelasgians, with whom the name of Argos was connected.\r\nThe name argei was also given to certain figures thrown into the\r\nTiber from the Sublician bridge, on the Ides of May in every year.\r\nThis was done by the pontifices, the vestals, the praetors, and other\r\ncitizens, after the performance of the customary sacrifices. The\r\nimages were thirty in number, made of bulrushes, and in the form of\r\nmen. Ovid makes various suppositions to account for the origin of\r\nthis rite; we can only conjecture that it was a symbolical offering,\r\nto propitiate the gods, and that the number was a representative\r\neither of the thirty patrician curiae at Rome, or perhaps of the\r\nthirty Latin townships.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGENTĀRĬI, bankers or money changers. (1) GREEK. The bankers at\r\nAthens were called _Trapezitae_ (τραπεζίται), from their tables\r\n(τραπεζαι) at which they sat, while carrying on their business, and\r\nwhich were in the market place. Their principal occupation was that\r\nof changing money; but they frequently took money, at a moderate\r\npremium, from persons who did not like to occupy themselves with\r\nthe management of their own affairs, and placed it out at interest.\r\nTheir usual interest was 36 per cent.; a rate that at present\r\nscarcely occurs except in cases of money lent on bottomry. The only\r\ninstance of a bank recognized and conducted on behalf of the state\r\noccurs at Byzantium, where at one time it was let by the republic\r\nto capitalists to farm. Yet the state probably exercised some kind\r\nof superintendence over the private bankers, since it is hardly\r\npossible otherwise to account for the unlimited confidence which they\r\nenjoyed.--(2) ROMAN. The _Argentarii_ at Rome must be distinguished\r\nfrom the _mensarii_ and _nummularii_, or public bankers. [MENSARII.]\r\nThe argentarii were private persons, who carried on business on their\r\nown responsibility, and were not in the service of the republic;\r\nbut the shops or _tabernae_ about the forum, which they occupied,\r\nand in which they transacted their business, were state property.\r\nThe business of the argentarii may be divided into the following\r\nbranches. 1. _Permutatio_, or the exchange of foreign coin for Roman,\r\nand in later times the giving of bills of exchange payable in foreign\r\ntowns. 2. The keeping of sums of money for other persons. Such money\r\nmight be deposited by the owner merely to save himself the trouble\r\nof keeping it and making payments, and in this case it was called\r\n_depositum_; the argentarius then paid no interest, and the money was\r\ncalled _vacua pecunia_. Or the money was deposited on condition of\r\nthe argentarius paying interest; in this case the money was called\r\n_creditum_. A payment made through a banker was called _per mensam_,\r\n_de mensa_, or _per mensae scripturam_, while a payment made by the\r\ndebtor in person was a payment _ex arca_ or _de domo_. An argentarius\r\nnever paid away any person’s money without being either authorised by\r\nhim in person or receiving a cheque which was called _perscriptio_.\r\nThe argentarii kept accurate accounts in books called _codices_,\r\n_tabulae_, or _rationes_, and there is every reason for believing\r\nthat they were acquainted with what is called in book-keeping double\r\nentry. When a party found to be in debt paid what he owed, he had\r\nhis name effaced (_nomen expedire_ or _expungere_) from the banker’s\r\nbooks. 3. Their connection with commerce and public auctions. In\r\nprivate sales and purchases, they sometimes acted as agents for\r\neither party (_interpretes_), and sometimes they undertook to sell\r\nthe whole estate of a person, as an inheritance. At public auctions\r\nthey were almost invariably present, registering the articles sold,\r\ntheir prices, and purchasers, and receiving the payment from the\r\npurchasers. 4. The testing of the genuineness of coins (_probatio\r\nnummorum_). This, however, seems originally to have been a part of\r\nthe duty of public officers, the mensarii or nummularii, until in\r\nthe course of time the opinion of an argentarius also came to be\r\nlooked upon as decisive. 5. The _solidorum venditio_, that is, the\r\nobligation of purchasing from the mint the newly coined money, and\r\ncirculating it among the people. This branch of their functions\r\noccurs only under the empire. The argentarii formed a collegium,\r\ndivided into _societates_ or corporations, which alone had the right\r\nto admit new members of their guild. None but freemen could become\r\nmembers of such a corporation. It has already been observed that the\r\nargentarii had their shops round the forum: hence to become bankrupt\r\nwas expressed by _foro cedere_, or _abire_, or _foro mergi_.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGENTUM (ἄργυρος), silver. The relative value of gold and silver\r\ndiffered considerably at different periods in Greek and Roman\r\nhistory. Herodotus mentions it as 13 to 1; Plato, as 12 to 1;\r\nMenander, as 10 to 1; and Livy as 10 to 1, about B.C. 189. According\r\nto Suetonius, Julius Caesar, on one occasion, exchanged silver for\r\ngold in the proportion of 9 to 1; but the most usual proportion under\r\nthe early Roman emperors was about 12 to 1. The proportion in modern\r\ntimes, since the discovery of the American mines, has varied between\r\n17 to 1 and 14 to 1. In the earliest times the Greeks obtained their\r\nsilver chiefly as an article of commerce from the Phocaeans and the\r\nSamians; but they soon began to work the rich mines of their own\r\ncountry and its islands. The chief mines were in Siphnos, Thessaly,\r\nand Attica. In the last-named country, the silver mines of Laurion\r\nfurnished a most abundant supply, and were generally regarded as\r\nthe chief source of the wealth of Athens. The Romans obtained most\r\nof their silver from the very rich mines of Spain, which had been\r\npreviously worked by the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, and which,\r\nthough abandoned for those of Mexico, are still not exhausted. By\r\nfar the most important use of silver among the Greeks was for money.\r\nThere are sufficient reasons for believing that, until some time\r\nafter the end of the Peloponnesian war, the Athenians had no gold\r\ncurrency. [AURUM.] It may be remarked that all the words connected\r\nwith money are derived from ἄργυρος, and not from χρυσός, as\r\nκαταργυρόω, “to bribe with money;” ἀργυραμοιβός, “a money changer,”\r\n&c.; and ἄργυρος is itself not unfrequently used to signify money\r\nin general, as _aes_ is in Latin. At Rome, on the contrary, silver\r\nwas not coined till B.C. 269, before which period Greek silver was\r\nin circulation at Rome; and the principal silver coin of the Romans,\r\nthe _denarius_, was borrowed from the Greek _drachma_. For further\r\ndetails respecting silver money, see DENARIUS, DRACHMA. From a very\r\nearly period, silver was used also in works of art; and the use of it\r\nfor mere purposes of luxury and ostentation, as in plate, was very\r\ngeneral both in Greece and Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGỸRASPĬDES (ἀργυράσπιδες), a division of the Macedonian army, who\r\nwere so called because they carried shields covered with silver\r\nplates.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGỸROCŎPEION (ἀργυροκοπεῖον), the place where money was coined, the\r\nmint, at Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂRĬES (κριός), the battering-ram, was used to batter down the walls\r\nof besieged cities. It consisted of a large beam, made of the trunk\r\nof a tree, especially of a fir or an ash. To one end was fastened a\r\nmass of bronze or iron (κεφαλή, ἐμβολή, προτομή), which resembled in\r\nits form the head of a ram. The aries in its simplest state was borne\r\nand impelled by human hands, without other assistance. In an improved\r\nform, the ram was surrounded with iron bands, to which rings were\r\nattached for the purpose of suspending it by ropes or chains from a\r\nbeam fixed transversely over it. By this contrivance the soldiers\r\nwere relieved from the necessity of supporting the weight of the ram,\r\nand could with ease give it a rapid and forcible motion backwards and\r\nforwards. The use of this machine was further aided by placing the\r\nframe in which it was suspended upon wheels, and also by constructing\r\nover it a wooden roof, so as to form a “testudo,” which protected the\r\nbesieging party from the defensive assaults of the besieged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aries, Battering Ram. (From Column of Trajan.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nĀRISTOCRĂTĬA (ἀριστοκρατία), signifies literally “the government of\r\nthe best men,” and as used by Plato, Aristotle, Polybius, &c., it\r\nmeant the government of a class whose supremacy was founded not on\r\nwealth merely, but on personal distinction. That there should be\r\nan aristocracy, moreover, it was essential that the administration\r\nof affairs should be conducted with a view to the promotion of the\r\ngeneral interests, not for the exclusive or predominant advantage\r\nof the privileged class As soon as the government ceased to be\r\nthus conducted, or whenever the only title to political power in\r\nthe dominant class was the possession of superior wealth, the\r\nconstitution was termed an oligarchy (ὀλιγαρχία), which, in the\r\ntechnical use of the term, was always looked upon as a corruption\r\n(παρέκβασις) of an aristocracy. In the practical application of the\r\nterm aristocracy, however, the personal excellence which was held to\r\nbe a necessary element was not of a higher kind than what, according\r\nto the deeply-seated ideas of the Greeks, was commonly hereditary in\r\nfamilies of noble birth, and in early times would be the ordinary\r\naccompaniments of noble rank, namely, wealth, military skill, and\r\nsuperior education and intelligence. It is to be noted that the word\r\nἀριστοκρατία is never, like the English term _aristocracy_, the name\r\nof a class, but only of a particular political constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Greek Soldier. (From an ancient vase.)\r\n\r\nRoman Soldiers. (From Column of Trajan.)]\r\n\r\nARMA, ARMĀTŪRA (ἔντεα, τεύχεα, Hom.; ὅπλα), arms, armour. Homer\r\ndescribes in various passages an entire suit of armour, and we\r\nobserve that it consisted of the same portions which were used by\r\nthe Greek soldiers ever after. Moreover, the order of putting them\r\non is always the same. The heavy-armed warrior, having already a\r\ntunic around his body, and preparing for combat, puts on--1. his\r\ngreaves (κνημῖδες, _ocreae_); 2. his cuirass (θώραξ, _lorica_), to\r\nwhich belonged the μίτρη underneath, and the zone (ζώνη, ζωστῆρ,\r\n_cingulum_), above; 3. his sword (ξίφος, _ensis_, _gladius_), hung on\r\nthe left side of his body by means of a belt which passed over the\r\nright shoulder; 4. the large round shield (σάκος, ἀσπίς, _clipeus_,\r\n_scutum_), supported in the same manner; 5. his helmet (κόρυς, κυνέη,\r\n_cassis_, _galea_); 6. he took his spear (ἔγχος, δόρυ, _hasta_), or\r\nin many cases, two spears. The form and use of these portions are\r\ndescribed in separate articles, under their Latin names. The annexed\r\ncut exhibits them all. Those who were defended in the manner which\r\nhas now been represented are called by Homer _aspistae_ (ἀσπισταί),\r\nfrom their great shield (ἀσπίς); also _angemachi_ (ἀγχεμάχοι),\r\nbecause they fought hand to hand with their adversaries; but much\r\nmore commonly _promachi_ (πρόμαχοι), because they occupied the\r\nfront of the army. In later times, the heavy-armed soldiers were\r\ncalled _hoplitae_ (ὁπλίται), because the term _hopla_ (ὄπλα) more\r\nespecially denoted the defensive armour, the shield and thorax. By\r\nwearing these they were distinguished from the light-armed (ψιλοί,\r\nἄνοπλοι, γυμνοί, γυμνῆται, γυμνῆτες), who, instead of being defended\r\nby the shield and thorax, had a much slighter covering, sometimes\r\nconsisting of skins, and sometimes of leather or cloth; and instead\r\nof the sword or lance, they commonly fought with darts, stones, bows\r\nand arrows, or slings. Besides the heavy and light-armed soldiers,\r\nanother description of men, the _peltastae_ (πελτασταί), also\r\nformed a part of the Greek army, though we do not hear of them in\r\nearly times. Instead of the large round shield, they carried a\r\nsmaller one called the _pelté_ (πέλτη), and in other respects their\r\narmour, though heavier and more effective than that of the psili,\r\nwas much lighter than that of the hoplites. The weapon on which they\r\nprincipally depended was the spear. The Roman legions consisted, as\r\nthe Greek infantry for the most part did, of heavy and light-armed\r\ntroops (_gravis et levis armatura_). The preceding figure represents\r\ntwo heavy-armed Roman soldiers. All the essential parts of the Roman\r\nheavy armour (_lorica_, _ensis_, _clipeus_, _galea_, _hasta_) are\r\nmentioned together, except the spear, in a well-known passage of St.\r\nPaul (_Eph._ vi. 17).\r\n\r\n\r\nARMĀRĬUM, originally a place for keeping arms, afterwards a cupboard,\r\nin which were kept not only arms, but also clothes, books, money, and\r\nother articles of value. The armarium was generally placed in the\r\natrium of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMILLA (ψάλιον, ψέλιον, or ψέλλιον, χλιδών, ἀμφιδέα), a bracelet or\r\narmlet, worn both by men and women. It was a favourite ornament of\r\nthe Medes and Persians. Bracelets do not appear to have been worn\r\namong the Greeks by the male sex, but Greek ladies had bracelets of\r\nvarious materials, shapes, and styles of ornament. They frequently\r\nexhibited the form of snakes, and were in such cases called snakes\r\n(ὄφεις) by the Athenians. According to their length, they went once,\r\ntwice, or thrice round the arm, or even a greater number of times.\r\nThe Roman generals frequently bestowed armillae upon soldiers for\r\ndeeds of extraordinary merit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Armillae, Bracelets. (Museo Borbonico, vol. ii. tav.\r\n14 vol. vii. tav. 46.)\r\n\r\nArmilla, Bracelet. (On Statue of Sleeping Ariadne in Vatican.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nARMĬLUSTRĬUM, a Roman festival for the purification of arms. It was\r\ncelebrated every year on the 19th of October, when the citizens\r\nassembled in arms, and offered sacrifices in the place called\r\nArmilustrum, or Vicus Armilustri.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRA, ARRĂBO, or ARRHA, ARRHABO, was the thing which purchasers\r\nand vendors gave to one another, whether it was a sum of money or\r\nanything else, as an evidence of the contract being made: it was\r\nno essential part of the contract of buying and selling, but only\r\nevidence of agreement as to price. The term arrha, in its general\r\nsense of an evidence of agreement, was also used on other occasions,\r\nas in the case of betrothment (_sponsalia_). Sometimes the word\r\narrha is used as synonymous with _pignus_, but this is not the legal\r\nmeaning of the term.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRHĒPHŎRĬA (ἀῤῥηφόρια), a festival celebrated at Athens in honour\r\nof Athena (Minerva). Four girls, of between seven and eleven years\r\n(ἀῤῥηφόροι, ἐρσηφόροι, ἐῤῥηφόροι), were selected every year by\r\nthe king archon from the most distinguished families, two of whom\r\nsuperintended the weaving of the sacred peplus of Athena; the two\r\nothers had to carry the mysterious and sacred vessels of the goddess.\r\nThese latter remained a whole year on the Acropolis; and when the\r\nfestival commenced, the priestess of the goddess placed vessels upon\r\ntheir heads, the contents of which were neither known to them nor to\r\nthe priestess. With these they descended to a natural grotto within\r\nthe district of Aphrodite in the gardens. Here they deposited the\r\nsacred vessels, and carried back something else, which was covered\r\nand likewise unknown to them. After this the girls were dismissed\r\nand others were chosen to supply their place in the acropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRŎGĀTĬO. [ADOPTIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nARTĂBA (ἀρτάβη), a Persian measure of capacity = 1 medimnus and 3\r\nchoenices (Attic) = 102 Roman sextarii = 12 gallons, 5·092 pints.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTĔMĪSĬA (ἀρτεμίσια), a festival celebrated at Syracuse in honour\r\nof Artemis Potamia and Soteira. It lasted three days, which were\r\nprincipally spent in feasting and amusements, Festivals of the same\r\nname, and in honour of the same goddess, were held in many places in\r\nGreece, but principally at Delphi.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOPTA. [PISTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂRŪRA (ἄρουρα), a Greek measure of surface, mentioned by Herodotus,\r\nwho says that it is a hundred Egyptian cubits in every direction. Now\r\nthe Egyptian cubit contained nearly 17¾ inches; therefore the square\r\nof 100 by 17¾ inches, _i.e._ nearly 148 feet, gives the number of\r\nsquare feet (English) in the arura, viz. 21,904.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂRUSPEX. [HARUSPEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nARVĀLES FRĀTRES, formed a college or company of twelve priests, and\r\nwere so called from offering public sacrifices for the fertility\r\nof the fields. That they were of extreme antiquity is proved by\r\nthe legend which refers their institution to Romulus, of whom it\r\nis said, that when his nurse Acca Laurentia lost one of her twelve\r\nsons, he allowed himself to be adopted by her in his place, and\r\ncalled himself and the remaining eleven “Fratres Arvales.” We also\r\nfind a college called the Sodales Titii, and as the latter were\r\nconfessedly of Sabine origin, and instituted for the purpose of\r\nkeeping up the Sabine religious rites, it is probable that these\r\ncolleges corresponded one to the other--the Fratres Arvales being\r\nconnected with the Latin, and the Sodales Titii with the Sabine\r\nelement of the Roman state. The office of the fratres arvales was\r\nfor life, and was not taken away even from an exile or captive.\r\nOne of their annual duties was to celebrate a three days’ festival\r\nin honour of Dea Dia, supposed to be Ceres, sometimes held on the\r\n17th, 19th, and 20th, sometimes on the 27th, 29th, and 30th of May.\r\nBut besides this festival of the Dea Dia, the fratres arvales were\r\nrequired on various occasions, under the emperors, to make vows\r\nand offer up thanksgivings. Under Tiberius, the Fratres Arvales\r\nperformed sacrifices called the _Ambarvalia_, at various places on\r\nthe borders of the ager Romanus, or original territory of Rome;\r\nand it is probable that this was a custom handed down from time\r\nimmemorial, and, moreover, that it was a duty of the priesthood to\r\ninvoke a blessing on the whole territory of Rome. There were also the\r\nprivate _ambarvalia_, which were so called from the victim (_hostia\r\nambarvalis_) that was slain on the occasion being led three times\r\nround the corn-fields, before the sickle was put to the corn. This\r\nvictim was accompanied by a crowd of merry-makers, the reapers and\r\nfarm-servants dancing and singing, as they marched, the praises of\r\nCeres, and praying for her favour and presence, while they offered\r\nher the libations of milk, honey, and wine. This ceremony was also\r\ncalled a _lustratio_, or purification.\r\n\r\n\r\nARX signifies a height within the walls of a city, upon which a\r\ncitadel was built, and thus came to be applied to the citadel\r\nitself. Thus one of the summits of the Capitoline hill at Rome is\r\ncalled _Arx_. The _Arx_ was the regular place at Rome for taking\r\nthe auspices, and was hence likewise called _auguraculum_; or, more\r\nprobably, the auguraculum was a place in the Arx.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS, or _Libra_, a pound, the unit of weight among the Romans. [LIBRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAS, the unit of value in the Roman and old Italian coinages, was\r\nmade of copper, or of the mixed metal called AES. It was originally\r\nof the weight of a pound of twelve ounces, whence it was called _as\r\nlibralis_ and _aes grave_. The oldest form of the _as_ is that which\r\nbears the figure of an animal (a bull, ram, boar, or sow). The next\r\nand most common form is that which has the two-faced head of Janus on\r\none side, and the prow of a ship on the other (whence the expression\r\nused by Roman boys in tossing up, _Capita aut navim_.) Pliny informs\r\nus, that in the time of the first Punic war (B.C. 264-241), in\r\norder to meet the expenses of the state, this weight of a pound was\r\ndiminished, and asses were struck of the same weight as the sextans\r\n(that is, two ounces, or one-sixth of the ancient weight); and that\r\nthus the republic paid off its debts, gaining five parts in six; that\r\nafterwards, in the second Punic war, in the dictatorship of Q. Fabius\r\nMaximus (B.C. 217), asses of one ounce were made, and the denarius\r\nwas decreed to be equal to sixteen asses, the republic thus gaining\r\none half; but that in military pay the denarius was always given for\r\nten asses; and that soon after, by the Papirian law (about B.C. 191),\r\nasses of half an ounce were made. The value of the as, of course,\r\nvaried with its weight. Before the reduction to two ounces, ten asses\r\nwere equal to the denarius = about 8½ pence English [DENARIUS].\r\nTherefore the as = 3·4 farthings. By the reduction the denarius\r\nwas made equal to sixteen asses; therefore the as = 2⅛ farthings.\r\nThe as was divided into parts, which were named according to the\r\nnumber of ounces they contained. They were the _deunx_, _dextans_,\r\n_dodrans_, _bes_, _septunx_, _semis_, _quincunx_, _triens_,\r\n_quadrans_ or _teruncius_, _sextans_, _sescunx_ or _sescuncia_, and\r\nuncia, consisting respectively of 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2,\r\n1½, and 1 ounces. Of these divisions the following were represented\r\nby coins; namely, the _semis_, _quincunx_, _triens_, _quadrans_,\r\n_sextans_, and _uncia_. After the reduction in the weight of the\r\nas, coins were struck of the value of 2, 3, 4, and even 10 asses,\r\nwhich were called respectively _dussis_ or _dupondius_, _tressis_,\r\n_quadrussis_, and _decussis_. Other multiples of the as were denoted\r\nby words of similar formation, up to _centussis_, 100 asses; but most\r\nof them do not exist as coins. In certain forms of expression, in\r\nwhich _aes_ is used for money without specifying the denomination,\r\nwe must understand the as. Thus _deni aeris_, _mille aeris_, _decies\r\naeris_, mean respectively 10, 1000, 1,000,000 _asses_. The word _as_\r\nwas used also for any whole which was to be divided into equal parts;\r\nand those parts were called _unciae_. Thus these words were applied\r\nnot only to weight and money, but to measures of length, surface,\r\nand capacity, to inheritances, interest, houses, farms, and many\r\nother things. Hence the phrases _haeres ex asse_, the heir to a whole\r\nestate; _haeres ex dodrante_, the heir to three-fourths. The _as_ was\r\nalso called in ancient times _assarius_ (sc. _nummus_), and in Greek\r\nτὸ ἀσσάριον. According to Polybius, the assarius was equal to half\r\nthe obolus.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCĬA (σκέπαρνον), an adze. The annexed cut shows two varieties of\r\nthe adze. The instrument at the bottom was called _acisculus_, and\r\nwas chiefly used by masons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Asciae, adzes. (From ancient monuments and a coin.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nASCLĒPIEIA (ἀσκληπίεια), the name of festivals which were probably\r\ncelebrated in all places where temples of Asclepius (Aesculapius)\r\nexisted. The most celebrated, however, was that of Epidaurus, which\r\ntook place every five years, and was solemnized with contests of\r\nrhapsodists and musicians, and with solemn processions and games.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCŌLĬASMUS (ἀσκωλιασμός, the leaping upon the leathern bag, ἀσκός)\r\nwas one of the many kinds of amusements in which the Athenians\r\nindulged during the Anthesteria and other festivals in honour of\r\nDionysus. Having sacrificed a he-goat to the god, they made a bag out\r\nof the skin, smeared it with oil, and then tried to dance upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ascoliasmus. (From an ancient gem.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂSĔBEIAS GRĂPHĒ (ἀσεβείας γραφή), one of the many forms prescribed\r\nby the Attic laws for the impeachment of impiety. Any citizen not\r\nincapacitated by disfranchisement (ἀτιμία) seems to have been a\r\ncompetent accuser; and citizens, resident aliens, and strangers, were\r\nequally liable to the accusation. Whether the causes were brought\r\ninto the areiopagus, or the common heliastic court, seems to have\r\nbeen determined by the form of action adopted by the prosecutor, or\r\nthe degree of competency to which the areiopagus rose or fell at the\r\ndifferent periods of Athenian history.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂSĬARCHAE (ἀσιάρχαι) were, in the Roman province of Asia, the chief\r\npresidents of the religious rites, whose office it was to exhibit\r\ngames and theatrical amusements every year, in honour of the gods and\r\nthe Roman emperor, at their own expense, like the Roman aediles. They\r\nwere ten in number, selected annually by the different towns of Asia,\r\nand approved of by the Roman proconsul; of these, one was the chief\r\nasiarch, and frequently, but not always, resided at Ephesus.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSĀRĬUS NUMMUS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nASSERTOR, or ADSERTOR, contains the same root as the verb _adserere_,\r\nwhich, when coupled with the word _manu_, signifies to lay hold\r\nof a thing, to draw it towards one. Hence the phrase _adserere\r\nin libertatem_, or _liberali adserere manu_, applies to him who\r\nlays his hand on a person reputed to be a slave, and _asserts_, or\r\nmaintains his freedom. The person who thus maintained the freedom of\r\na reputed slave was called _adsertor_. The person whose freedom was\r\nthus claimed was said to be _adsertus_. The expressions _liberalis\r\ncausa_, and _liberalis manus_, which occur in connection with the\r\nverb _adserere_, will easily be understood from what has been said.\r\nSometimes the word _adserere_ alone was used as equivalent to\r\n_adserere in libertatem_. The expression _asserere in servitutem_, to\r\nclaim a person as a slave, occurs in Livy.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSESSOR, or ADSESSOR, literally one who sits by the side of\r\nanother. Since the consuls, praetors, governors of provinces, and\r\nthe judices, were often imperfectly acquainted with the law and\r\nforms of procedure, it was necessary that they should have the aid\r\nof those who had made the law their study. The assessors sat on the\r\ntribunal with the magistrate. Their advice or aid was given during\r\nthe proceedings as well as at other times, but they never pronounced\r\na judicial sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSĬDUI. [LOCUPLETES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRĂGĂLUS (ἀστράγαλος), literally, that particular bone in the\r\nankles of certain quadrupeds, which the Greeks, as well as the\r\nRomans, used for dice and other purposes. [TALUS.] In architecture\r\nit signifies a certain moulding (the astragal) which seems to have\r\nderived its name from its resemblance to a string or chain of _tali_,\r\nand it is in fact always used in positions where it seems intended to\r\nbind together the parts to which it is applied. It belongs properly\r\nto the more highly decorated forms of the Ionic order, in which it\r\nappears as a lower edging to the larger mouldings, especially the\r\n_echinus_ (ovolo), particularly in the capital, as shown in the\r\nfollowing woodcut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Astragalus. (Capital of an Ionic Column. Dilettanti\r\nSociety, Ionian Antiquities.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRĂTEIAS GRĂPHĒ (ἀστρατείας γραφή), the accusation instituted at\r\nAthens against persons who failed to appear among the troops after\r\nthey had been enrolled for a campaign by the generals. The defendant,\r\nif convicted, incurred disfranchisement (ἀτιμία) both in his own\r\nperson and that of his descendants.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRŎLŎGĬA, astrology. A belief very early arose, which still\r\nprevails unshaken in the East, that a close connection subsisted\r\nbetween the position and movements of the heavenly bodies and the\r\nfate of man. Few doubted that the destiny of a child might be\r\npredicted with certainty by those who were skilled to interpret\r\nthe position of the stars at the moment of his birth, and that the\r\nresult of any undertaking might be foretold from the aspect of the\r\nfirmament when it was commenced. Hence a numerous and powerful\r\nclass of men arose who were distinguished by various designations.\r\nFrom the country where their science was first developed, they\r\nwere called _Chaldaei_ or _Babylonii_; from observing the stars,\r\n_astronomi_, _astrologi_, _planetarii_; from employing diagrams such\r\nas were used by geometricians, _mathematici_; from determining the\r\nlot of man at his natal hour, _genethliaci_; from prophesying the\r\nconsummation of his struggles, ἀποτελεσματικοί; while their art was\r\nknown as ἀστρολογία, μετεωρολογία, γενεθλιαλογία, ἀποτελεσματική,\r\n_Ars Chaldaeorum_, _Mathesis_, or, from the tables they consulted,\r\nπινακική. Their calculations were termed _Babylonii numeri_,\r\nΧαλδαίων μέθοδοι, Χαλδαίων ψηφίδες, _Rationes Chaldaicae_; their\r\nresponses when consulted _Chaldaeorum monita_, _Chaldaeorum natalicia\r\npraedicta_, _Astrologorum praedicta_. The stars and constellations\r\nto which attention was chiefly directed were the planets and the\r\nsigns of the zodiac, some of which were supposed to exert uniformly\r\na benign influence (ἀγαθοποιοὶ ἀστέρες), such as Venus, Jupiter,\r\nLuna, Virgo, Libra, Taurus; others to be uniformly malign (κακοποιοὶ\r\nἀστέρες), such as Saturnus, Mars, Scorpio, Capricornus; others to be\r\ndoubtful (ἐπίκοινοι ἀστέρες), such as Mercurius. The exact period of\r\nbirth (_hora genitalis_) being the critical moment, the computations\r\nfounded upon it were styled γένεσις(_genitura_), ὡροσκόπος\r\n(_horoscopus_), or simply θέμα, and the star or stars in the\r\nascendant _sidus natalitium_, _sidera natalitia_. Astrologers seem\r\nto have found their way very early into Italy. In B.C. 139 an edict\r\nwas promulgated by C. Cornelius Hispallus, at that time praetor, by\r\nwhich the Chaldaeans were ordered to quit Italy within ten days, and\r\nthey were again banished from the city in B.C. 33, by M. Agrippa, who\r\nwas then aedile. Another severe ordinance was levelled by Augustus\r\nagainst this class, but the frequent occurrence of such phrases as\r\n“expulit et mathematicos,” “pulsis Italia mathematicis,” in the\r\nhistorians of the empire prove how firm a hold these pretenders must\r\nhave obtained over the public mind, and how profitable the occupation\r\nmust have been which could induce them to brave disgrace, and\r\nsometimes a cruel death.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTỸNŎMI (ἀστυνόμοι), or street-police of Athens, were ten in number,\r\nfive for the city, and as many for the Peiraeeus. The _astynomi_ and\r\n_agoranomi_ divided between them most of the functions of the Roman\r\naediles. [AGORANOMI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĂSῩLUM (ἄσυλον). In the Greek states the temples, altars, sacred\r\ngroves, and statues of the gods, generally possessed the privilege\r\nof protecting slaves, debtors, and criminals, who fled to them for\r\nrefuge. The laws, however, do not appear to have recognised the\r\nright of all such sacred places to afford the protection which was\r\nclaimed, but to have confined it to a certain number of temples, or\r\naltars, which were considered in a more especial manner to have the\r\nἀσυλία, or _jus asyli_. There were several places in Athens which\r\npossessed this privilege; of which the best known was the Theseium,\r\nor temple of Theseus, in the city, near the gymnasium, which was\r\nchiefly intended for the protection of ill-treated slaves, who could\r\ntake refuge in this place, and compel their masters to sell them to\r\nsome other person. In the time of Tiberius, the number of places\r\npossessing the jus asyli in the Greek cities in Greece and Asia\r\nMinor became so numerous, as seriously to impede the administration\r\nof justice; and, consequently, the senate, by the command of the\r\nemperor, limited the jus asyli to a few cities. The asylum, which\r\nRomulus is said to have opened at Rome to increase the population of\r\nthe city, was a place of refuge for the inhabitants of other states,\r\nrather than a sanctuary for those who had violated the laws of the\r\ncity. In the republican and early imperial times, a right of asylum,\r\nsuch as existed in the Greek states, does not appear to have been\r\nrecognised by the Roman law; but it existed under the empire, and a\r\nslave could fly to the temples of the gods, or the statues of the\r\nemperors, to avoid the ill-usage of his master.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂTĔLEIA (ἀτέλεια), immunity from public burthens, was enjoyed at\r\nAthens by the archons for the time being; by the descendants of\r\ncertain persons, on whom it had been conferred as a reward for great\r\nservices, as in the case of Harmodius and Aristogeiton; and by the\r\ninhabitants of certain foreign states. It was of several kinds: it\r\nmight be a general immunity (ἀτέλεια ἁπάντων); or a more special\r\nexemption, as from custom-duties, from the liturgies, or from\r\nproviding sacrifices.\r\n\r\n\r\nĀTELLĀNAE FĂBŬLAE were a species of farce or comedy, so called from\r\nAtella, a town of the Osci, in Campania. From this circumstance,\r\nand from being written in the Oscan dialect, they were also called\r\n_Ludi Osci_. These Atellane plays were not _praetextatae_, _i.e._\r\ncomedies in which magistrates and persons of rank were introduced,\r\nnor _tabernariae_, the characters in which were taken from low life;\r\nthey rather seem to have been a union of high comedy and its parody.\r\nThey were also distinguished from the mimes by the absence of low\r\nbuffoonery and ribaldry, being remarkable for a refined humour, such\r\nas could be understood and appreciated by educated people. They were\r\nnot performed by regular actors (_histriones_), but by Roman citizens\r\nof noble birth, who were not on that account subjected to any\r\ndegradation, but retained their rights as citizens, and might serve\r\nin the army. The Oscan or Opican language, in which these plays were\r\nwritten, was spread over the whole of the south of Italy, and from\r\nits resemblance to the Latin could easily be understood by the more\r\neducated Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂTHĒNAEUM (ἀθήναιον), a school (_ludus_) founded by the Emperor\r\nHadrian at Rome, for the promotion of literary and scientific studies\r\n(_ingenuarum artium_), and called Athenaeum from the town of Athens,\r\nwhich was still regarded as the seat of intellectual refinement.\r\nThe Athenaeum was situated on the Capitoline hill. It was a kind of\r\nuniversity, with a staff of professors, for the various branches\r\nof study. Besides the instruction given by these magistri, poets,\r\norators, and critics were accustomed to recite their compositions\r\nthere, and these prelections were sometimes honoured with the\r\npresence of the emperors themselves. The Athenaeum seems to have\r\ncontinued in high repute till the fifth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nATHLĒTAE (ἀθληταί, ἀθλητῆρες), persons who contended in the public\r\ngames of the Greeks and Romans for prizes (ἆθλα, whence the name of\r\nἀθληταί), which were given to those who conquered in contests of\r\nagility and strength. The name was in the later period of Grecian\r\nhistory, and among the Romans, properly confined to those persons\r\nwho entirely devoted themselves to a course of training which might\r\nfit them to excel in such contests, and who, in fact, made athletic\r\nexercises their profession. The athletae differed, therefore, from\r\nthe _agonistae_ (ἀγωνισταί), who only pursued gymnastic exercises\r\nfor the sake of improving their health and bodily strength, and who,\r\nthough they sometimes contended for the prizes in the public games,\r\ndid not devote their whole lives, like the athletae, to preparing\r\nfor these contests. Athletae were first introduced at Rome, B.C.\r\n186, in the games exhibited by M. Fulvius, on the conclusion of\r\nthe Aetolian war. Aemilius Paullus, after the conquest of Perseus,\r\nB.C. 167, is said to have exhibited games at Amphipolis, in which\r\nathletae contended. Under the Roman emperors, and especially under\r\nNero, who was passionately fond of the Grecian games, the number of\r\nathletae increased greatly in Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor. Those\r\nathletae who conquered in any of the great national festivals of\r\nthe Greeks were called _Hieronicae_ (ἱερονῖκαι), and received the\r\ngreatest honours and rewards. Such a conqueror was considered to\r\nconfer honour upon the state to which he belonged; he entered his\r\nnative city through a breach made in the walls for his reception, in\r\na chariot drawn by four white horses, and went along the principal\r\nstreet of the city to the temple of the guardian deity of the state.\r\nThose games, which gave the conquerors the right of such an entrance\r\ninto the city, were called _Iselastici_ (from εἰσελαύνειν). This term\r\nwas originally confined to the four great Grecian festivals, the\r\nOlympian, Isthmian, Nemean, and Pythian, but was afterwards applied\r\nto other public games. In the Greek states, the victors in these\r\ngames not only obtained the greatest glory and respect, but also\r\nsubstantial rewards. They were generally relieved from the payment\r\nof taxes, and also enjoyed the first seat (προεδρία) in all public\r\ngames and spectacles. Their statues were frequently erected at the\r\ncost of the state, in the most frequented part of the city, as the\r\nmarket-place, the gymnasia, and the neighbourhood of the temples. At\r\nAthens, according to a law of Solon, the conquerors in the Olympic\r\ngames were rewarded with a prize of 500 drachmae; and the conquerors\r\nin the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian, with one of 100 drachmae;\r\nand at Sparta they had the privilege of fighting near the person\r\nof the king. The privileges of the athletae were secured, and in\r\nsome respects increased, by the Roman emperors. The term athletae,\r\nthough sometimes applied metaphorically to other combatants, was\r\nproperly limited to those who contended for the prize in the five\r\nfollowing contests:--1. _Running_ (δρόμος, _cursus_). [STADIUM.]\r\n2. _Wrestling_ (πάλη, _lucta_). 3. _Boxing_ (πυγμή, _pugilatus_).\r\n4. The _pentathlum_ (πένταθλον), or, as the Romans called it,\r\n_quinquertium_. 5. The _pancratium_ (παγκράτιον). Of all these an\r\naccount is given in separate articles. Great attention was paid to\r\nthe training of the athletae. They were generally trained in the\r\n_palaestrae_, which, in the Grecian states, were distinct places from\r\nthe gymnasia. Their exercises were superintended by the gymnasiarch,\r\nand their diet was regulated by the aliptes. [ALIPTAE.]--The\r\nathletae were accustomed to contend naked. In the descriptions of\r\nthe games given in the Iliad, the combatants are represented with\r\na girdle about their loins; and the same practice, as we learn\r\nfrom Thucydides, anciently prevailed at the Olympic games, but was\r\ndiscontinued afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nĂTĪMĬA (ἀτιμία), the forfeiture of a man’s civil rights at Athens.\r\nIt was either total or partial. A man was totally deprived of his\r\nrights, both for himself and for his descendants (καθάπαξ ἄτιμος),\r\nwhen he was convicted of murder, theft, false witness, partiality as\r\narbiter, violence offered to a magistrate, and so forth. This highest\r\ndegree of atimia excluded the person affected by it from the forum,\r\nand from all public assemblies; from the public sacrifices, and from\r\nthe law courts; or rendered him liable to immediate imprisonment,\r\nif he was found in any of these places. It was either temporary\r\nor perpetual, and either accompanied or not with confiscation of\r\nproperty. Partial atimia only involved the forfeiture of some\r\nfew rights, as, for instance, the right of pleading in court.\r\nPublic debtors were suspended from their civic functions till they\r\ndischarged their debt to the state. People who had once become\r\naltogether atimi were very seldom restored to their lost privileges.\r\nThe converse term to _atimia_ was _epitimia_ (ἐπιτιμία).\r\n\r\n\r\nATLANTES (ἄτλαντες) and TĔLĂMŌNES (τελαμῶνες), terms used in\r\narchitecture, the former by the Greeks, the latter by the Romans, to\r\ndesignate those male figures which are sometimes fancifully used,\r\nlike the female _Caryatides_, in place of columns. Both words are\r\nderived from τλῆναι, and the former evidently refers to the fable of\r\nAtlas, who supported the vault of heaven, the latter _perhaps_ to\r\nthe strength of the Telamonian Ajax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Atlantes. (From Temple at Agrigentum: Professor\r\nCockerell.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nĀTRĀMENTUM, a term applicable to any black colouring substance, for\r\nwhatever purpose it may be used, like the _melan_ (μέλαν) of the\r\nGreeks. There were, however, three principal kinds of atramentum:\r\none called _librarium_, or _scriptorium_ (in Greek, γραφικὸν μέλαν),\r\nwriting-ink; another called _sutorium_, which was used by the\r\nshoemakers for dyeing leather; the third _tectorium_, or _pictorium_,\r\nwhich was used by painters for some purposes, apparently as a sort\r\nof varnish. The inks of the ancients seem to have been more durable\r\nthan our own; they were thicker and more unctuous, in substance and\r\ndurability more resembling the ink now used by printers. An inkstand\r\nwas discovered at Herculaneum, containing ink as thick as oil, and\r\nstill usable for writing. The ancients used inks of various colours.\r\nRed ink, made of _minium_ or vermilion, was used for writing the\r\ntitles and beginning of books. So also was ink made of _rubrica_,\r\n“red ochre;” and because the headings of _laws_ were written with\r\nrubrica, the word rubric came to be used for the civil law. So\r\n_album_, a white or whited table, on which the praetors’ edicts\r\nwere written, was used in a similar way. A person devoting himself\r\nto _album_ and _rubrica_, was a person devoting himself to the law.\r\n[ALBUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĀTRĬUM (called αὐλή by the Greeks and by Virgil, and also μεσαύλιον,\r\nπερίστυλον, περίστῳον) is used in a distinctive as well as collective\r\nsense, to designate a particular part in the private houses of the\r\nRomans [DOMUS], and also a class of public buildings, so called\r\nfrom their general resemblance in construction to the atrium of a\r\nprivate house. An atrium of the latter description was a building by\r\nitself, resembling in some respects the open basilica [BASILICA],\r\nbut consisting of three sides. Such was the Atrium Publicum in\r\nthe capitol, which, Livy informs us, was struck with lightning,\r\nB.C. 216. It was at other times attached to some temple or other\r\nedifice, and in such case consisted of an open area and surrounding\r\nportico in front of the structure. Several of these buildings are\r\nmentioned by the ancient historians, two of which were dedicated to\r\nthe same goddess, Libertas. The most celebrated, as well as the most\r\nancient, was situated on the Aventine Mount. In this atrium there\r\nwas a tabularium, where the legal tablets (_tabulae_) relating to\r\nthe censors were preserved. The other Atrium Libertatis was in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Forum Caesaris, and was immediately behind the\r\nBasilica Paulli or Aemilia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUCTĬO signifies generally “an increasing, an enhancement,” and hence\r\nthe name is applied to a public sale of goods, at which persons\r\nbid against one another. The sale was sometimes conducted by an\r\n_argentarius_, or by a _magister auctionis_; and the time, place,\r\nand conditions of sale, were announced either by a public notice\r\n(_tabula_, _album_, &c.), or by a crier (_praeco_). The usual phrases\r\nto express the giving notice of a sale were, _auctionem proscribere,\r\npraedicare_; and to determine on a sale, _auctionem constituere_.\r\nThe purchasers (_emtores_), when assembled, were sometimes said\r\n_ad tabulam adesse_. The phrases signifying to bid are, _liceri_,\r\n_licitari_, which was done either by word of mouth, or by such\r\nsignificant hints as are known to all people who have attended an\r\nauction. The property was said to be knocked down (_addici_) to the\r\npurchaser. The praeco, or crier, seems to have acted the part of the\r\nmodern auctioneer, so far as calling out the biddings, and amusing\r\nthe company. Slaves, when sold by auction, were placed on a stone,\r\nor other elevated thing, as is the case when slaves are sold in\r\nthe United States of North America; and hence the phrase _homo de\r\nlapide emtus_. It was usual to put up a spear (_hasta_) in auctions;\r\na symbol derived, it is said, from the ancient practice of selling\r\nunder a spear the booty acquired in war.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUCTOR, a word which contains the same element as _aug-eo_, and\r\nsignifies generally one who enlarges, confirms, or gives to a\r\nthing its completeness and efficient form. The numerous technical\r\nsignifications of the word are derivable from this general notion. As\r\nhe who gives to a thing that which is necessary for its completeness\r\nmay in this sense be viewed as the chief actor or doer, the\r\nword auctor is also used in the sense of one who originates or\r\nproposes a thing; but this cannot be viewed as its primary meaning.\r\nAccordingly, the word auctor, when used in connection with lex or\r\nsenatus consultum, often means him who originates and proposes.--The\r\nexpressions _patres auctores fiunt_, _patres auctores facti_, have\r\ngiven rise to much discussion. In the earlier periods of the Roman\r\nstate, the word _patres_ was equivalent to _patricii_; in the later\r\nperiod, when the patricians had lost all importance as a political\r\nbody, the term patres signified the senate. Hence some ambiguity has\r\narisen. The expression _patres auctores fiunt_, when used of the\r\nearly period of Rome, means that the determinations of the populus\r\nin the comitia centuriata were confirmed by the patricians in the\r\ncomitia curiata. Till the time of Servius Tullius there were only\r\nthe comitia curiata, and this king first established the comitia\r\ncenturiata, in which the plebs also voted, and consequently it was\r\nnot till after this time that the phrase _patres auctores fiunt_\r\ncould be properly applied. Livy, however, uses it of an earlier\r\nperiod. The comitia curiata first elected the king, and then by\r\nanother vote conferred upon him the imperium. The latter was called\r\n_lex curiata de imperio_, an expression not used by Livy, who\r\nemploys instead the phrase _patres auctores fiunt_ (Liv. i. 17, 22,\r\n32).--After the exile of the last Tarquin, the patres, that is the\r\npatricians, had still the privilege of confirming at the comitia\r\ncuriata the vote of the comitia centuriata, that is, they gave to\r\nit the _patrum auctoritas_; or, in other words, the _patres_ were\r\n_auctores facti_. In the fifth century of the city a change was made.\r\nBy one of the laws of the plebeian dictator Q. Publilius Philo, it\r\nwas enacted that in the case of leges to be enacted at the comitia\r\ncenturiata, the _patres_ should be _auctores_, that is, the curiae\r\nshould give their assent before the vote of the comitia centuriata.\r\nBy a lex Maenia of uncertain date the same change was made as to\r\nelections.--But both during the earlier period and afterwards no\r\nbusiness could be brought before the comitia without first receiving\r\nthe sanction of the senate; and accordingly the phrase _patres\r\nauctores fiunt_ came now to be applied to the approval of a measure\r\nby the senate before it was confirmed by the votes of the people.\r\nThis preliminary approval was also termed _senatus auctoritas_.--When\r\nthe word auctor is applied to him who recommends but does not\r\noriginate a legislative measure, it is equivalent to _suasor_.\r\nSometimes both auctor and suasor are used in the same sentence, and\r\nthe meaning of each is kept distinct. With reference to dealings\r\nbetween individuals, auctor has the sense of owner. In this sense\r\nauctor is the seller (_venditor_), as opposed to the buyer (_emtor_):\r\nand hence we have the phrase _a malo auctore emere_. Auctor is also\r\nused generally to express any person under whose authority any legal\r\nact is done. In this sense, it means a tutor who is appointed to aid\r\nor advise a woman on account of the infirmity of her sex.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUCTŌRĀMENTUM, the pay of gladiators. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAUCTŌRĬTAS. The technical meanings of this word correlate with those\r\nof auctor. The auctoritas senatus was not a senatus-consultum; it\r\nwas a measure, incomplete in itself, which received its completion\r\nby some other authority. Auctoritas, as applied to property, is\r\nequivalent to legal ownership, being a correlation of auctor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUDĪTŌRĬUM, as the name implies, is any place for hearing. It was\r\nthe practice among the Romans for poets and others to read their\r\ncompositions to their friends, who were sometimes called the\r\nauditorium; but the word was also used to express any place in which\r\nany thing was heard, and under the empire it was applied to a court\r\nof justice. Under the republic the place for all judicial proceedings\r\nwas the comitium and the forum. But for the sake of shelter and\r\nconvenience it became the practice to hold courts in the Basilicae,\r\nwhich contained halls, which were also called auditoria. It is first\r\nunder M. Aurelius that the auditorium principis is mentioned, by\r\nwhich we must understand a hall or room in the imperial residence;\r\nand in such a hall Septimius Severus and the later emperors held\r\ntheir regular sittings when they presided as judges. The latest\r\njurists use the word generally for any place in which justice was\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUR, AUGŬRĬUM; AUSPEX, AUSPĬCĬUM. _Augur_ or _auspex_ meant\r\na diviner by birds, but came in course of time, like the Greek\r\nοἰωνός, to be applied in a more extended sense: his art was called\r\n_augurium_ or _auspicium_. Plutarch relates that the _augures_ were\r\noriginally termed _auspices_. The word _auspex_ was supplanted by\r\n_augur_, but the scientific term for the observation continued on\r\nthe contrary to be _auspicium_ and not _augurium_. By Greek writers\r\non Roman affairs, the augurs are called οἰωνοπόλοι, οἰωνοσκόποι,\r\nοἰωνισταί, οἱ ἐπ’ οἰωνοῖς ἱερεῖς. The belief that the flight of\r\nbirds gave some intimation of the will of the gods seems to have\r\nbeen prevalent among many nations of antiquity, and was common to\r\nthe Greeks, as well as the Romans; but it was only among the latter\r\npeople that it was reduced to a complete system, governed by fixed\r\nrules, and handed down from generation to generation. In Greece,\r\nthe oracles supplanted the birds, and the future was learnt from\r\nApollo and other gods, rarely from Zeus, who possessed very few\r\noracles in Greece. The contrary was the case at Rome: it was from\r\nJupiter that the future was learnt, and the birds were regarded\r\nas his messengers. It must be remarked in general, that the Roman\r\nauspices were essentially of a practical nature; they gave no\r\ninformation respecting the course of future events, they did not\r\ninform men _what was to happen_, but simply taught them _what they\r\nwere to do, or not to do_; they assigned no reason for the decision\r\nof Jupiter--they simply announced, yes or no. The words _augurium_\r\nand _auspicium_ came to be used in course of time to signify the\r\nobservation of various kinds of signs. They were divided into five\r\nsorts: _ex caelo_, _ex avibus_, _ex tripudiis_, _ex quadrupedibus_,\r\n_ex diris_. Of these, the last three formed no part of the ancient\r\nauspices.--1. _Ex caelo._ This included the observation of the\r\nvarious kinds of thunder and lightning, and was regarded as the\r\nmost important, _maximum auspicium_. Whenever it was reported by a\r\nperson authorised to take the auspices, that Jupiter thundered or\r\nlightened, the comitia could not be held.--2. _Ex avibus._ It was\r\nonly a few birds which could give auguries among the Romans. They\r\nwere divided into two classes: _Oscines_, those which gave auguries\r\nby singing, or their voice, and _Alites_, those which gave auguries\r\nby their flight. To the former class belonged the raven (_corvus_)\r\nand the crow (_cornix_), the first of these giving a favourable omen\r\n(_auspicium ratum_) when it appeared on the right, the latter, on the\r\ncontrary, when it was seen on the left: likewise the owl (_noctua_)\r\nand the hen (_gallina_). To the _aves alites_ belonged first of all\r\nthe eagle (_aquila_), which is called pre-eminently the bird of\r\nJupiter (_Jovis ales_), and next the vulture (_vultur_). Some birds\r\nwere included both among the _oscines_ and the _alites_: such were\r\nthe _Picus Martius_, and _Feronius_, and the _Parra_. These were the\r\nprincipal birds consulted in the auspices. When the birds favoured an\r\nundertaking, they were said _addicere_, _admittere_ or _secundare_,\r\nand were then called _addictivae_, _admissivae_, _secundae_, or\r\n_praepetes_: when unfavourable they were said _abdicere_, _arcere_,\r\n_refragari_, &c., and were then called _adversae_ or _alterae_.\r\nThe birds which gave unfavourable omens were termed _funebres_,\r\n_inhibitae_, _lugubres_, _malae_, &c., and such auspices were called\r\n_clivia_ and _clamatoria_.--3. _Ex tripudiis._ These auspices were\r\ntaken from the feeding of chickens, and were especially employed on\r\nmilitary expeditions. The chickens were kept in a cage, under care of\r\na person called _pullarius_; and when the auspices were to be taken,\r\nthe pullarius opened the cage and threw to the chickens pulse or a\r\nkind of soft cake. If they refused to come out or to eat, or uttered\r\na cry (_occinerent_), or beat their wings, or flew away, the signs\r\nwere considered unfavourable. On the contrary, if they ate greedily,\r\nso that something fell from their mouth and struck the earth, it\r\nwas called _tripudium solistimum_ (_tripudium_ quasi _terripavium_,\r\n_solistimum_, from _solum_, according to the ancient writers), and\r\nwas held a favourable sign.--4. _Ex quadrupedibus._ Auguries could\r\nalso be taken from four-footed animals; but these formed no part of\r\nthe original science of the augurs, and were never employed by them\r\nin taking auspices on behalf of the state, or in the exercise of\r\ntheir art properly so called. They must be looked upon simply as a\r\nmode of private divination. When a fox, a wolf, a horse, a dog, or\r\nany other kind of quadruped ran across a person’s path or appeared in\r\nan unusual place, it formed an augury.--5. _Ex diris_, sc. _signis_.\r\nUnder this head was included every kind of augury which does not fall\r\nunder any of the four classes mentioned above, such as sneezing,\r\nstumbling, and other accidental things. There was an important\r\naugury of this kind connected with the army, which was called _ex\r\nacuminibus_, that is, the flames appearing at the points of spears or\r\nother weapons. The ordinary manner of taking the auspices, properly\r\nso called (i.e. _ex caelo_ and _ex avibus_), was as follows: The\r\nperson who was to take them first marked out with a wand (_lituus_)\r\na division in the heavens called _templum_ or _tescum_, within which\r\nhe intended to make his observations. The station where he was to\r\ntake the auspices was also separated by a solemn formula from the\r\nrest of the land, and was likewise called _templum_ or _tescum_.\r\nHe then proceeded to pitch a tent in it (_tabernaculum capere_),\r\nand this tent again was also called _templum_, or, more accurately,\r\n_templum minus_. [TEMPLUM.] Within the walls of Rome, or, more\r\nproperly speaking, within the pomoerium, there was no occasion to\r\nselect a spot and pitch a tent on it, as there was a place on the\r\nArx on the summit of the Capitoline hill, called _Auguraculum_,\r\nwhich had been consecrated once for all for this purpose. In like\r\nmanner there was in every Roman camp a place called _augurale_, which\r\nanswered the same purpose; but on all other occasions a place had to\r\nbe consecrated, and a tent to be pitched, as, for instance, in the\r\nCampus Martius, when the comitia centuriata were to be held. The\r\nperson who was then taking the auspices waited for the favourable\r\nsigns to appear; but it was necessary during this time that there\r\nshould be no interruption of any kind whatsoever (_silentium_), and\r\nhence the word _silentium_ was used in a more extended sense to\r\nsignify the absence of every thing that was faulty. Every thing, on\r\nthe contrary, that rendered the auspices invalid was called _vitium_;\r\nand hence we constantly read in Livy and other writers of _vitio\r\nmagistratus creati_, _vitio lex lata_, &c. The watching for the\r\nauspices was called _spectio_ or _servare de coelo_, the declaration\r\nof what was observed _nuntiatio_, or, if they were unfavourable,\r\n_obnuntiatio_. In the latter case, the person who took the auspices\r\nseems usually to have said _alio die_, by which the business in hand,\r\nwhether the holding of the _comitia_ or any thing else, was entirely\r\nstopped.--In ancient times no one but a patrician could take the\r\nauspices. Hence the possession of the auspices (_habere auspicia_)\r\nis one of the most distinguished prerogatives of the patricians;\r\nthey are said to be _penes patrum_, and are called _auspicia\r\npatrum_. It would further appear that every patrician might take\r\nthe auspices; but here a distinction is to be observed between the\r\n_auspicia privata_ and _auspicia publica_. One of the most frequent\r\noccasions on which the _auspicia privata_ were taken, was in case of\r\na marriage: and this was one great argument used by the patricians\r\nagainst _connubium_ between themselves and the plebeians, as it\r\nwould occasion, they urged, _perturbationem auspiciorum publicorum\r\nprivatorumque_. In taking these private auspices, it would appear\r\nthat any patrician was employed who knew how to form _templa_ and\r\nwas acquainted with the art of augury. The case, however, was very\r\ndifferent with respect to the _auspicia publica_, generally called\r\n_auspicia_ simply, or those which concerned the state. The latter\r\ncould only be taken by the persons who represented the state, and who\r\nacted as mediators between the gods and the state; for though all the\r\npatricians were eligible for taking the auspices, yet it was only the\r\nmagistrates who were in actual possession of them. In case, however,\r\nthere was no patrician magistrate, the auspices became vested in the\r\nwhole body of the patricians (_auspicia ad patres redeunt_), who had\r\nrecourse to an _interregnum_ for the renewal of them, and for handing\r\nthem over in a perfect state to the new magistrates: hence we find\r\nthe expressions _repetere de integro auspicia_, and _renovare per\r\ninterregnum auspicia_.--The distinction between the duties of the\r\nmagistrates and the augurs in taking the auspices is one of the\r\nmost difficult points connected with this subject, but perhaps a\r\nsatisfactory solution of these difficulties may be found by taking\r\nan historical view of the question. We are told not only that the\r\nkings were in possession of the auspices, but that they themselves\r\nwere acquainted with the art and practised it. Romulus is stated to\r\nhave appointed three augurs, but only as his assistants in taking\r\nthe auspices, a fact which it is important to bear in mind. Their\r\ndignity gradually increased in consequence of their being employed\r\nat the inauguration of the kings, and also in consequence of their\r\nbecoming the preservers and depositaries of the science of augury.\r\nFormed into a collegium, they handed down to their successors the\r\nvarious rules of the science, while the kings, and subsequently the\r\nmagistrates of the republic, were liable to change. Their duties thus\r\nbecame two-fold, to assist the magistrates in taking up auspices,\r\nand to preserve a scientific knowledge of the art. As the augurs\r\nwere therefore merely the assistants of the magistrates, they could\r\nnot take the auspices without the latter, though the magistrates on\r\nthe contrary could dispense with their assistance. At the same time\r\nit must be borne in mind, that as the augurs were the interpreters\r\nof the science, they possessed the right of declaring whether the\r\nauspices were valid or invalid. They thus possessed in reality a\r\nveto upon every important public transaction; and they frequently\r\nexercised this power as a political engine to vitiate the election\r\nof such parties as were unfavourable to the enclusive privileges of\r\nthe patricians. But although the augurs could declare that there was\r\nsome fault in the auspices, yet, on the other hand, they could not,\r\nby virtue of their office, declare that any unfavourable sign had\r\nappeared to them, since it was not to them that the auspices were\r\nsent. Thus we are told that the augurs did not possess the _spectio_.\r\nThis _spectio_ was of two kinds, one more extensive and the other\r\nmore limited. In the one case the person who exercised it could put a\r\nstop to the proceedings of any other magistrate by his obnuntiatio:\r\nthis was called _spectio et nuntiatio_ (perhaps also _spectio cum\r\nnuntiatione_), and belonged only to the highest magistrates, the\r\nconsuls, dictators, interreges, and, with some modifications, to\r\nthe praetors. In the other case, the person who took the auspices\r\nonly exercised the _spectio_ in reference to the duties of his own\r\noffice, and could not interfere with any other magistrate: this\r\nwas called _spectio sine nuntiatione_, and belonged to the other\r\nmagistrates, the censors, aediles, and quaestors. Now as the augurs\r\ndid not possess the auspices, they consequently could not possess\r\nthe spectio (_habere spectionem_); but as the augurs were constantly\r\nemployed by the magistrates to take the auspices, they _exercised_\r\nthe spectio, though they did not _possess_ it in virtue of their\r\noffice. When they were employed by the magistrates in taking the\r\nauspices, they possessed the right of the _nuntiatio_, and thus had\r\nthe power, by the declaration of unfavourable signs (_obnuntiatio_),\r\nto put a stop to all important public transactions.--The auspices\r\nwere not conferred upon the magistrates in any special manner. It\r\nwas the act of their election which made them the recipients of the\r\nauspices, since the comitia, in which they were appointed to their\r\noffice, were held _auspicato_, and consequently their appointment\r\nwas regarded as ratified by the gods. The auspices, therefore,\r\npassed immediately into their hands upon the abdication of their\r\npredecessors in office.--The auspices belonging to the different\r\nmagistrates were divided into two classes, called _auspicia maxima_\r\nor _majora_ and _minora_. The former, which belonged originally to\r\nthe kings, passed over to the consuls, censors, and praetors, and\r\nlikewise to the extraordinary magistrates, the dictators, interreges,\r\nand consular tribunes. The quaestors and the curule aediles, on the\r\ncontrary, had only the _auspicia minora_.--It was a common opinion in\r\nantiquity that a college of three augurs was appointed by Romulus,\r\nanswering to the number of the early tribes, the Ramnes, Tities,\r\nand Lucerenses, but the accounts vary respecting their origin and\r\nnumber. At the passing of the Ogulnian law (B.C. 300) the augurs were\r\nfour in number. This law increased the number of pontiffs to eight,\r\nby the addition of four plebeians, and that of the augurs to nine\r\nby the addition of five plebeians. The number of nine augurs lasted\r\ndown to the dictatorship of Sulla, who increased them to fifteen,\r\na multiple of the original three, probably with a reference to the\r\nearly tribes. A sixteenth was added by Julius Caesar after his\r\nreturn from Egypt. The members of the college of augurs possessed\r\nthe right of self-election (_cooptatio_) until B.C. 103, the year\r\nof the Domitian law. By this law it was enacted that vacancies in\r\nthe priestly colleges should be filled up by the votes of a minority\r\nof the tribes, _i.e._ seventeen out of thirty-five chosen by lot.\r\nThe Domitian law was repealed by Sulla B.C. 81, but again restored\r\nB.C. 63, during the consulship of Cicero, by the tribune T. Annius\r\nLabienus, with the support of Caesar. It was a second time abrogated\r\nby Antony B.C. 44; whether again restored by Hirtius and Pansa in\r\ntheir general annulment of the acts of Antony, seems uncertain.\r\nThe emperors possessed the right of electing augurs at pleasure.\r\nThe augurs were elected for life, and even if capitally convicted,\r\nnever lost their sacred character. When a vacancy occurred, the\r\ncandidate was nominated by two of the elder members of the college,\r\nthe electors were sworn, and the new member was then solemnly\r\ninaugurated. On such occasion there was always a splendid banquet\r\ngiven, at which all the augurs were expected to be present. The only\r\ndistinction in the college was one of age; an elder augur always\r\nvoted before a younger, even if the latter filled one of the higher\r\noffices in the state. The head of the college was called _magister\r\ncollegii_. As insignia of their office the augurs wore the _trabea_,\r\nor public dress, and carried in their hand the _lituus_ or curved\r\nwand. [LITUUS.] On the coins of the Romans, who filled the office\r\nof augur, we constantly find the _lituus_, and along with it, not\r\nunfrequently, the _capis_, an earthen vessel which was used by them\r\nin sacrifices. The science of the augurs was called _jus augurum_\r\nand _jus augurium_, and was preserved in books (_libri augurales_),\r\nwhich are frequently mentioned in the ancient writers. The expression\r\nfor consulting the augurs was _referre ad augures_, and their\r\nanswers were called _decreta_ or _responsa augurum_. The science of\r\naugury had greatly declined in the time of Cicero; and although he\r\nfrequently deplores its neglect in his _De Divinatione_, yet neither\r\nhe nor any of the educated classes appears to have had any faith in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coin representing the lituus and capis on the reverse.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAŪGŬRĀCŬLUM.

[AUGUR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUSTĀLES--(1) (sc. _ludi_, also called _Augustalia_, sc.\r\n_certamina_, _ludicra_), games celebrated in honour of Augustus, at\r\nRome and in other parts of the Roman empire. After the battle of\r\nActium, a quinquennial festival was instituted; and the birthday\r\nof Augustus, as well as that on which the victory was announced at\r\nRome, were regarded as festival days. It was not, however, till\r\nB.C. 11 that the festival on the birthday of Augustus was formally\r\nestablished by a decree of the senate, and it is this festival which\r\nis usually meant when the Augustales or Augustalia are mentioned.\r\nIt was celebrated iv. Id. Octobr. At the death of Augustus, this\r\nfestival assumed a more solemn character, was added to the Fasti,\r\nand celebrated to his honour as a god. It was henceforth exhibited\r\nannually in the circus, at first by the tribunes of the plebs, at the\r\ncommencement of the reign of Tiberius, but afterwards by the praetor\r\nperegrinus.--(2) The name of two classes of priests, one at Rome and\r\nthe other in the municipia. The _Augustales_ at Rome, properly called\r\n_sodales Augustales_, were an order of priests instituted by Tiberius\r\nto attend to the worship of Augustus and the Julia gens. They were\r\nchosen by lot from among the principal persons of Rome, and were\r\ntwenty-one in number, to which were added Tiberius, Drusus, Claudius,\r\nand Germanicus, as members of the imperial family. They were also\r\ncalled _sacerdotes Augustales_, and sometimes simply _Augustales_.\r\nThe _Augustales_ in the municipia are supposed by most modern writers\r\nto have been a class of priests selected by Augustus from the\r\nlibertini to attend to the religions rites connected with the worship\r\nof the Lares, which that emperor was said to have put up in places\r\nwhere two or more ways met; but there are good reasons for thinking\r\nthat they were instituted in imitation of the Augustales at Rome, and\r\nfor the same object, namely, to attend to the worship of Augustus.\r\nThey formed a collegium and were appointed by the _decuriones_, or\r\nsenate of the municipia. The six principal members of the college\r\nwere called _Seviri_, a title which seems to have been imitated from\r\nthe _Seviri_ in the equestrian order at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUSTUS, a name bestowed upon Octavianus in B.C. 27, by the senate\r\nand the Roman people. It was a word used in connection with religion,\r\nand designated a person as sacred and worthy of worship; hence\r\nthe Greek writers translate it by Σεβαστός. It was adopted by all\r\nsucceeding emperors, as if descended, either by birth or adoption,\r\nfrom the first emperor of the Roman world. The name of _Augusta_\r\nwas frequently bestowed upon females of the imperial family; but\r\n_Augustus_ belonged exclusively to the reigning emperor till towards\r\nthe end of the second century of the Christian aera, when M. Aurelius\r\nand L. Verus both received this surname. From this time we frequently\r\nfind two or even a greater number of _Augusti_. From the time of\r\nProbus the title became _perpetuus Augustus_, and from Philippus or\r\nClaudius Gothicus _semper Augustus_, the latter of which titles was\r\nborne by the so-called Roman emperors in Germany. [CAESAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAULAEUM. [SIPARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAURĔUS. [AURUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAURĪGA. [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aureus Nummus. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nAURUM (χρυσός), gold. Gold was scarce in Greece. The chief places\r\nfrom which the Greeks procured their gold were India, Arabia,\r\nArmenia, Colchis, and Troas. It was found mixed with the sands of the\r\nPactolus and other rivers. Almost the only method of purifying gold,\r\nknown to the ancients, seems to have been that of grinding and then\r\nroasting it, and by this process they succeeded in getting it very\r\npure. This is what we are to understand by the phrase χρυσίον ἄπεφθον\r\nin Thucydides, and by the word _obrussa_ in Pliny. The art of gilding\r\nwas known to the Greeks from the earliest times of which we have any\r\ninformation. The time when gold was first coined at Athens is very\r\nuncertain, but on the whole it appears most probable that gold money\r\nwas not coined there, or in Greece Proper generally, till the time of\r\nAlexander the Great, if we except a solitary issue of debased gold at\r\nAthens in B.C. 407. But from a very early period the Asiatic nations,\r\nand the Greek cities of Asia Minor and the adjacent islands, as well\r\nas Sicily and Cyrene, possessed a gold coinage, which was more or\r\nless current in Greece. Herodotus says that the Lydians were the\r\nfirst who coined gold, and the stater of Croesus appears to have been\r\nthe earliest gold coin known to the Greeks. The Daric was a Persian\r\ncoin. Staters of Cyzicus and Phocaea had a considerable currency in\r\nGreece. There was a gold coinage in Samos as early as the time of\r\nPolycrates. The islands of Siphnos and Thasos, which possessed gold\r\nmines, appear to have had a gold coinage at an early period. The\r\nMacedonian gold coinage came into circulation in Greece in the time\r\nof Philip, and continued in use till the subjection of Greece to the\r\nRomans. [DARICUS; STATER.] The standard gold coin of Rome was the\r\n_aureus nummus_, or _denarius aureus_, which, according to Pliny,\r\nwas first coined 62 years after the first silver coinage [ARGENTUM],\r\nthat is, in the year 207 B.C. The lowest denomination was the\r\n_scrupulum_, which was made equal to 20 sestertii. The weight of the\r\nscrupulum was 18·06 grains. The annexed cut represents a gold coin\r\nof 60 sestertii. Pliny adds that afterwards aurei were coined of 40\r\nto the pound, which weight was diminished, till under Nero they were\r\n45 to the pound. The average weight of the aurei of Augustus, in the\r\nBritish Museum, is 121·26 grains: and as the weight was afterwards\r\ndiminished, we may take the average at 120 grains. The value of the\r\naureus in terms of the sovereign = 1_l._ 1_s._ 1_d._ and a little\r\nmore than a halfpenny. This is its value according to the present\r\nworth of gold; but its current value in Rome was different from\r\nthis, on account of the difference in the worth of the metal. The\r\naureus passed for 25 denarii; therefore, the denarius being 8½_d._,\r\nit was worth 17_s._ 8½_d._ The ratio of the value of gold to that of\r\nsilver is given in the article ARGENTUM. Alexander Severus coined\r\npieces of one-half and one-third of the aureus, called _Semissis_\r\nand _tremissis_, after which time the aureus was called _solidus_.\r\nConstantine the Great coined aurei of 72 to the pound; at which\r\nstandard the coin remained to the end of the empire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aureus of Augustus. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAURUM CŎRŌNĀRĬUM. When a general in a Roman province had obtained a\r\nvictory, it was the custom for the cities in his own provinces, and\r\nfor those from the neighbouring states, to send golden crowns to him,\r\nwhich were carried before him in his triumph at Rome. In the time of\r\nCicero it appears to have been usual for the cities of the provinces,\r\ninstead of sending crowns on occasion of a victory, to pay money,\r\nwhich was called _aurum coronarium_. This offering, which was at\r\nfirst voluntary, came to be regarded as a regular tribute, and was\r\nsometimes exacted by the governors of the provinces, even when no\r\nvictory had been gained.\r\n\r\n\r\nAURUM VĪCĒSĬMĀRĬUM.

This name was also given to those cities subject to\r\nthe Romans, which were permitted to enjoy their own laws and elect\r\ntheir own magistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUXĬLĬA. [SOCII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAXĀMENTA.

According to some writers the _Axones_\r\ncontained the civil, and the _Kurbeis_ the religious laws; according\r\nto others the _Kurbeis_ had four sides and the _Axones_ three. But at\r\nAthens, at all events, they seem to have been identical. They were at\r\nfirst preserved in the Acropolis, but were afterwards placed in the\r\nagora, in order that all persons might be able to read them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBĀLISTA, BALLISTA. [TORMENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBALNĔUM or BĂLĬNĔUM (λοετρόν or λουτρόν, βαλανεῖον, also _balneae_\r\nor _balineae_), a bath. _Balneum_ or _balineum_ signifies, in\r\nits primary sense, a bath or bathing vessel, such as most Romans\r\npossessed in their own houses; and from that it came to mean\r\nthe chamber which contained the bath. When the baths of private\r\nindividuals became more sumptuous, and comprised many rooms, the\r\nplural _balnea_ or _balinea_ was adopted, which still, in correct\r\nlanguage, had reference only to the baths of private persons.\r\n_Balneae_ and _balineae_, which have no singular number, were the\r\npublic baths. But this accuracy of diction is neglected by many of\r\nthe later writers. _Thermae_ (from θέρμη, warmth) means properly\r\nwarm springs, or baths of warm water, but was afterwards applied to\r\nthe structures in which the baths were placed, and which were both\r\nhot and cold. There was, however, a material distinction between the\r\n_balneae_ and _thermae_, inasmuch as the former was the term used\r\nunder the republic, and referred to the public establishments of\r\nthat age, which contained no appliances for luxury beyond the mere\r\nconvenience of hot and cold baths, whereas the latter name was given\r\nto those magnificent edifices which grew up under the empire, and\r\nwhich comprised within their range of buildings all the appurtenances\r\nbelonging to the Greek gymnasia, as well as a regular establishment\r\nappropriated for bathing.--Bathing was a practice familiar to the\r\nGreeks of both sexes from the earliest times. The artificial warm\r\nbath was taken in a vessel called _asaminthus_ (ἀσάμινθος) by Homer,\r\nand _puelus_ (πύελος) by the later Greeks. It did not contain water\r\nitself, but was only used for the bather to sit in, while the\r\nwarm water was poured over him. On Greek vases, however, we never\r\nfind anything corresponding to a modern bath in which persons can\r\nstand or sit; but there is always a round or oval basin (λουτήρ or\r\nλουτήριον), resting on a stand, by the side of which those who are\r\nbathing are standing undressed and washing themselves. In the Homeric\r\ntimes it was customary to take first a cold and afterwards a warm\r\nbath; but in later times it was the usual practice of the Greeks to\r\ntake first a warm or vapour, and afterwards a cold bath. At Athens\r\nthe frequent use of the public baths, most of which were warm baths\r\n(βαλανεῖα, called by Homer θερμὰ λοετρά), was regarded in the time\r\nof Socrates and Demosthenes as a mark of luxury and effeminacy.\r\nAccordingly, Phocion was said to have never bathed in a public bath,\r\nand Socrates to have used it very seldom. After bathing both sexes\r\nanointed themselves, in order that the skin might not be left harsh\r\nand rough, especially after warm water. Oil (ἔλαιον) is the only\r\nointment mentioned by Homer, but in later times precious unguents\r\n(μῦρα) were used for this purpose. The bath was usually taken before\r\nthe principal meal of the day (δεῖπνον). The Lacedaemonians, who\r\nconsidered warm water as enervating, used two kinds of baths; namely,\r\nthe cold daily bath in the Eurotas, and a dry sudorific bath in a\r\nchamber heated with warm air by means of a stove, and from them\r\nthe chamber used by the Romans for a similar purpose was termed\r\n_Laconicum_. A sudorific or vapour bath (πυρία or πυριατήριον) is\r\nmentioned as early as the time of Herodotus. At what period the use\r\nof the warm bath was introduced among the Romans is not recorded; but\r\nwe know that Scipio had a warm bath in his villa at Liternum, and\r\nthe practice of heating an apartment with warm air by flues placed\r\nimmediately under it, so as to produce a vapour bath, is stated to\r\nhave been invented by Sergius Orata, who lived in the age of Crassus,\r\nbefore the Marsic war. By the time of Cicero the use of baths of\r\nwarm water and hot air had become common, and in his time there were\r\nbaths at Rome which were open to the public upon payment of a small\r\nfee. In the public baths at Rome the men and women used originally to\r\nbathe in separate sets of chambers; but under the empire it became\r\nthe common custom for both sexes to bathe indiscriminately in the\r\nsame bath. This practice was forbidden by Hadrian and M. Aurelius;\r\nand Alexander Severus prohibited any baths, common to both sexes,\r\nfrom being opened in Rome. The price of a bath was a quadrant, the\r\nsmallest piece of coined money, from the age of Cicero downwards,\r\nwhich was paid to the keeper of the bath (_balneator_). Children\r\nbelow a certain age were admitted free. It was usual with the Romans\r\nto take the bath after exercise, and before the principal meal\r\n(_coena_) of the day; but the debauchees of the empire bathed also\r\nafter eating as well as before, in order to promote digestion, and to\r\nacquire a new appetite for fresh delicacies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roman Bath. (Fresco from the Thermae of Titus.)]\r\n\r\nUpon quitting the bath the Romans as well as the Greeks were\r\nanointed with oil. The Romans did not content themselves with a\r\nsingle bath of hot or cold water; but they went through a course of\r\nbaths in succession, in which the agency of air as well as water was\r\napplied. It is difficult to ascertain the precise order in which\r\nthe course was usually taken; but it appears to have been a general\r\npractice to close the pores, and brace the body after the excessive\r\nperspiration of the vapour bath, either by pouring cold water over\r\nthe head, or by plunging at once into the _piscina_. To render the\r\nsubjoined remarks more easily intelligible, the preceding woodcut is\r\ninserted, which is taken from a fresco painting upon the walls of\r\nthe thermae of Titus at Rome. The chief parts of a Roman bath were\r\nas follow:--1. _Apodyterium._ Here the bathers were expected to take\r\noff their garments, which were then delivered to a class of slaves,\r\ncalled _capsarii_, whose duty it was to take charge of them. These\r\nmen were notorious for dishonesty, and were leagued with all the\r\nthieves of the city, so that they connived at the robberies which\r\nthey were placed to prevent. There was probably an _Elaeothesium_\r\nor _Unctorium_, as appears from the preceding cut, in connection\r\nwith the apodyterium, where the bathers might be anointed with\r\noil.--2. _Frigidarium_ or _Cella Frigidaria_, where the cold bath\r\nwas taken. The cold bath itself was called _Natatio_, _Natatorium_,\r\n_Piscina_, _Baptisterium_, or _Puteus_.--3. _Tepidarium_ would seem\r\nfrom the preceding cut to have been a bathing room, for a person\r\nis there apparently represented pouring water over a bather. But\r\nthere is good reason for thinking that this was not the case. In\r\nmost cases the tepidarium contained no water at all, but was a\r\nroom merely heated with warm air of an agreeable temperature, in\r\norder to prepare the body for the great heat of the vapour and warm\r\nbaths, and upon returning from the latter, to obviate the danger\r\nof a too sudden transition to the open air.--4. The _Caldarium_ or\r\n_Concamerata Sudatio_ contained at one extremity the vapour bath\r\n(_Laconicum_), and at the other the warm bath (_balneum_ or _calda\r\nlavatio_), while the centre space between the two ends was termed\r\n_sudatio_ or _sudatorium_. In larger establishments the vapour bath\r\nand warm bath were in two separate cells, as we see in the preceding\r\ncut: in such cases the former part _alone_ was called _concamerata\r\nsudatio_. The whole rested on a suspended pavement (_suspensura_),\r\nunder which was a fire (_hypocaustum_), so that the flames might heat\r\nthe whole apartment. (See cut.) The warm water bath (_balneum_ or\r\n_calda lavatio_), which is also called _piscina_ or _calida piscina_,\r\n_labrum_ and _solium_, appears to have been a capacious marble vase,\r\nsometimes standing upon the floor, like that in the preceding cut,\r\nand sometimes either partly elevated above the floor, as it was at\r\nPompeii, or entirely sunk into it. After having gone, through the\r\nregular course of perspiration, the Romans made use of instruments\r\ncalled _strigiles_ or _strigles_, to scrape off the perspiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Strigil. (From a Relief at Athens.)]\r\n\r\nThe strigil was also used by the Greeks, who called it _stlengis_\r\n(στλεγγίς) or _xystra_ (ξύστρα). The figure in the cut on p. 24 is\r\nrepresented with a strigil in his hand. As the strigil was not a\r\nblunt instrument, its edge was softened by the application of oil,\r\nwhich was dropped upon it from a small vessel called _guttus_ or\r\n_ampulla_, which had a narrow neck, so as to discharge its contents\r\ndrop by drop, from whence the name is taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Strigil and Guttus. (From a Statue in the Vatican.)]\r\n\r\nIn the _Thermae_, spoken of above, the baths were of secondary\r\nimportance. They were a Roman adaptation of the Greek gymnasium,\r\ncontained exedrae for the philosophers and rhetoricians to lecture\r\nin, porticoes for the idle, and libraries for the learned, and were\r\nadorned with marbles, fountains, and shaded walks and plantations.\r\nM. Agrippa, in the reign of Augustus, was the first who afforded\r\nthese luxuries to his countrymen, by bequeathing to them the thermae\r\nand gardens which he had erected in the Campus Martius. The example\r\nset by Agrippa was followed by Nero, and afterwards by Titus, the\r\nruins of whose thermae are still visible, covering a vast extent,\r\npartly under ground and partly above the Esquiline hill. Thermae were\r\nalso erected by Trajan, Caracalla, and Diocletian, of the two last\r\nof which ample remains still exist. Previously to the erection of\r\nthese establishments for the use of the population, it was customary\r\nfor those who sought the favour of the people to give them a day’s\r\nbathing free of expense. From thence it is fair to infer that the\r\nquadrant paid for admission into the _balneae_ was not exacted at the\r\n_thermae_, which, as being the works of the emperors, would naturally\r\nbe opened with imperial generosity to all, and without any charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALTĔUS (τελαμών), a belt, a shoulder belt, was used to suspend the\r\nsword. See the figs. on p. 41. In the Homeric times the Greeks used\r\na belt to support the shield. The balteus was likewise employed\r\nto suspend the quiver, and sometimes together with it the bow.\r\nMore commonly the belt, whether employed to support the sword, the\r\nshield, or the quiver, was made of leather, and was frequently\r\nornamented with gold, silver, and precious stones. In a general\r\nsense _balteus_ was applied not only to the belt which passed over\r\nthe shoulder, but also to the girdle (_cingulum_), which encompassed\r\nthe waist. In architecture, Vitruvius applies the term _Baltei_ to\r\nthe bands surrounding the volute on each side of an Ionic capital.\r\nOther writers apply it to the _praecinctiones_ of an amphitheatre.\r\n[AMPHITHEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBĂRATHRON (βάραθρον), also called ORUGMA (ὄρυγμα), a deep cavern or\r\nchasm, like the Ceadas at Sparta, behind the Acropolis at Athens,\r\ninto which criminals were thrown. [CEADAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBA (πώγων, γένειον, ὑπήνη), the beard. The Greeks seem generally\r\nto have worn the beard till the time of Alexander the Great; and\r\na thick beard was considered as a mark of manliness. The Greek\r\nphilosophers in particular were distinguished by their long beards\r\nas a sort of badge. The Romans in early times wore the beard uncut,\r\nand the Roman beards are said not to have been shaved till B.C. 300,\r\nwhen P. Ticinius Maena brought over a barber from Sicily; and Pliny\r\nadds, that the first Roman who is said to have been shaved every day\r\nwas Scipio Africanus. His custom, however, was soon followed, and\r\nshaving became a regular thing. In the later times of the republic\r\nthere were many who shaved the beard only partially, and trimmed it,\r\nso as to give it an ornamental form; to them the terms _bene barbati_\r\nand _barbatuli_ are applied. In the general way at Rome, a long\r\nbeard (_barba promissa_) was considered a mark of slovenliness and\r\n_squalor_. The first time of shaving was regarded as the beginning\r\nof manhood, and the day on which this took place was celebrated as\r\na festival. There was no particular time fixed for this to be done.\r\nUsually, however, it was done when the young Roman assumed the toga\r\nvirilis. The hair cut off on such occasions was consecrated to\r\nsome god. Thus Nero put his up in a gold box, set with pearls, and\r\ndedicated it to Jupiter Capitolinus. Under the emperor Hadrian the\r\nbeard began to revive. Plutarch says that the emperor wore it to hide\r\nsome scars on his face. The practice afterwards became common, and\r\ntill the time of Constantine the Great, the emperors appear in busts\r\nand coins with beards. The Romans let their beards grow in time of\r\nmourning; the Greeks, on the other hand, on such occasions shaved the\r\nbeard close.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBĬTUS (βάρβιτος), or BARBĬTON (βάρβιτον), a stringed instrument,\r\nthe original form of which is uncertain. Later writers use it as\r\nsynonymous with the lyra. [LYRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBASCAUDA, a British basket. This term, which remains with very little\r\nvariation in the Welsh “basgawd” and the English “basket,” was\r\nconveyed to Rome together with the articles denoted by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBĂSĬLĬCA (sc. _aedes_, _aula_, _porticus_--βασιλική, also _regia_),\r\na building which served as a court of law and an exchange, or place\r\nof meeting for merchants and men of business. The word was adopted\r\nfrom the Athenians, whose second archon was styled _archon basileus_\r\n(ἄρχων βασιλεύς), and the tribunal where he adjudicated _stoa\r\nbasileius_ (ἡ βασίλειος στοά), the substantive _aula_ or _porticus_\r\nin Latin being omitted for convenience, and the distinctive epithet\r\nconverted into a substantive. The first edifice of this description\r\nat Rome was not erected until B.C. 182. It was situated in the\r\nforum adjoining the curia, and was denominated Basilica Porcia, in\r\ncommemoration of its founder, M. Porcius Cato. Besides this there\r\nwere twenty others erected at different periods, within the city\r\nof Rome. The forum, or, where there was more than one, the one\r\nwhich was in the most frequented and central part of the city, was\r\nalways selected for the site of a basilica; and hence it is that the\r\nclassic writers not unfrequently use the terms _forum_ and _basilica_\r\nsynonymously. The ground plan of all these buildings is rectangular,\r\nand their width not more than half, nor less than one-third of the\r\nlength. This area was divided into three naves, consisting of a\r\ncentre (_media porticus_), and two side aisles, separated from the\r\ncentre one, each by a single row of columns. At one end of the centre\r\naisle was the tribunal of the judge, in form either rectangular or\r\ncircular, as is seen in the annexed plan of the basilica at Pompeii.\r\nIn the centre of the tribunal was placed the curule chair of the\r\npraetor, and seats for the judices and the advocates. The two side\r\naisles, as has been said, were separated from the centre one by a\r\nrow of columns, behind each of which was placed a square pier or\r\npilaster (_parastata_), which supported the flooring of an upper\r\nportico, similar to the gallery of a modern church. The upper gallery\r\nwas in like manner decorated with columns, of lower dimensions than\r\nthose below; and these served to support the roof, and were connected\r\nwith one another by a parapet-wall or balustrade (_pluteus_), which\r\nserved as a defence against the danger of falling over, and screened\r\nthe crowd of loiterers above (_sub-basilicani_) from the people of\r\nbusiness in the area below. Many of these edifices were afterwards\r\nused as Christian churches, and many churches were built after the\r\nmodel above described. Such churches were called _basilicae_, which\r\nname they retain to the present day, being still called at Rome\r\n_basiliche_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan of a Basilica.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBASTERNA, a kind of litter (_lectica_) in which women were carried\r\nin the time of the Roman emperors. It appears to have resembled the\r\nLectica [LECTICA] very closely; and the only difference apparently\r\nwas, that the lectica was carried by slaves, and the basterna by two\r\nmules.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAXA, or BAXĔA, a sandal made of vegetable leaves, twigs, or fibres,\r\nworn on the stage by comic actors.\r\n\r\n\r\nBĒMA (βῆμα). [ECCLESIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBENDĬDEIA (βενδίδεια), a Thracian festival in honour of the goddess\r\nBendis, who is said to be identical with the Grecian Artemis and with\r\nthe Roman Diana. The festival was of a bacchanalian character. From\r\nThrace it was brought to Athens, where it was celebrated in the\r\nPeiraeeus, on the 19th or 20th of the month Thargelion, before the\r\nPanathenaea Minora. The temple of Bendis was called Bendideion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBĔNĔFĬCĬUM, BĔNĔFĬCĬĀRĬUS. The term _beneficium_ is of frequent\r\noccurrence in the Roman law, in the sense of some special privilege\r\nor favour granted to a person in respect of age, sex, or condition.\r\nBut the word was also used in other senses. In the time of Cicero\r\nit was usual for a general, or a governor of a province, to report\r\nto the treasury the names of those under his command who had done\r\ngood service to the state: those who were included in such report\r\nwere said _in beneficiis ad aerarium deferri_. _In beneficiis_ in\r\nthese passages may mean that the persons so reported were considered\r\nas persons who had deserved well of the state; and so the word\r\n_beneficium_ may have reference to the services of the individuals;\r\nbut as the object for which their services were reported was the\r\nbenefit of the individuals, it seems that the term had reference also\r\nto the reward, immediate or remote, obtained for their services. The\r\nhonours and offices of the Roman state, in the republican period,\r\nwere called the _beneficia_ of the Populus Romanus. Beneficium also\r\nsignified any promotion conferred on or grant made to soldiers, who\r\nwere thence called _beneficiarii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBESTIĀRĬI (θηριομάχοι), persons who fought with wild beasts in the\r\ngames of the circus. They were either persons who fought for the sake\r\nof pay (_auctoramentum_), and who were allowed arms, or they were\r\ncriminals, who were usually permitted to have no means of defence\r\nagainst the wild beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLĬŎPŌLA (βιβλιοπώλης), also called _librarius_, a bookseller.\r\nThe shop was called _apotheca_ or _taberna libraria_, or merely\r\n_libraria_. The Romans had their Paternoster-row; for the bibliopolae\r\nor librarii lived mostly in one street, called Argiletum. Another\r\nfavourite quarter of the booksellers was the Vicus Sandalarius.\r\nThere seems also to have been a sort of bookstalls by the temples of\r\nVertumnus and Janus.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLĬŎTHĒCA (βιβλιοθήκη, or ἀποθήκη βιβλίων), primarily, the place\r\nwhere a collection of books was kept; secondarily, the collection\r\nitself. Public collections of books appear to have been very ancient.\r\nThat of Peisistratus (B.C. 550) was intended for public use; it\r\nwas subsequently removed to Persia by Xerxes. About the same time\r\nPolycrates, tyrant of Samos, is said to have founded a library. In\r\nthe best days of Athens, even private persons had large collections\r\nof books; but the most important and splendid public library of\r\nantiquity was that founded by the Ptolemies at Alexandria, begun\r\nunder Ptolemy Soter, but increased and re-arranged in an orderly\r\nand systematic manner by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who also appointed a\r\nfixed librarian, and otherwise provided for the usefulness of the\r\ninstitution. A great part of this splendid library was consumed\r\nby fire in the siege of Alexandria by Julius Caesar; but it was\r\nsoon restored, and continued in a flourishing condition till it\r\nwas destroyed by the Arabs, A.D. 640. The Ptolemies were not long\r\nwithout a rival in zeal. Eumenes, king of Pergamus, became a patron\r\nof literature and the sciences, and established a library, which,\r\nin spite of the prohibition against exporting papyrus issued by\r\nPtolemy, who was jealous of his success, became very extensive, and\r\nperhaps next in importance to the library of Alexandria. The first\r\npublic library in Rome was that founded by Asinius Pollio, and was\r\nin the atrium Libertatis on Mount Aventine. The library of Pollio\r\nwas followed by that of Augustus in the temple of Apollo on Mount\r\nPalatine and by another, bibliothecae Octavianae, in the theatre of\r\nMarcellus. There were also libraries on the Capitol, in the temple of\r\nPeace, in the palace of Tiberius, besides the Ulpian library, which\r\nwas the most famous, founded by Trajan. Libraries were also usually\r\nattached to the Thermae. [BALNEUM.] Private collections of books were\r\nmade at Rome soon after the second Punic war. The zeal of Cicero,\r\nAtticus, and others, in increasing their libraries is well known. It\r\nbecame, in fact, the fashion to have a room elegantly furnished as a\r\nlibrary, and reserved for that purpose. The charge of the libraries\r\nin Rome was given to persons called _librarii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBĪCOS (βῖκος), the name of an earthen vessel in common use among the\r\nGreeks, for holding wine, and salted meat and fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nBĬDENTAL, the name given to a place where any one had been struck\r\nby lightning, or where any one had been killed by lightning and\r\nburied. Such a place was considered sacred. Priests, who were\r\ncalled _bidentales_, collected the earth which had been torn up by\r\nlightning, and every thing that had been scorched, and burnt it in\r\nthe ground with a sorrowful murmur. The officiating priest was said\r\n_condere fulgur_; he further consecrated the spot by sacrificing a\r\ntwo-year-old sheep (_bidens_), whence the name of the place and of\r\nthe priest, and he also erected an altar, and surrounded it with a\r\nwall or fence. To move the bounds of a bidental, or in any way to\r\nviolate its sacred precincts, was considered as sacrilege.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIDIAEI (βιδιαῖοι), magistrates in Sparta, whose business was to\r\ninspect the gymnastic exercises. They were either five or six in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n\r\nBĪGA or BĪGAE. [CURRUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBĪGĀTUS. [DENARIUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBĬPENNIS. [SECURIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBĬRĒMIS. (1.) A ship with two banks of oars. [NAVIS.] Such ships\r\nwere called _dicrota_ by the Greeks, which term is also used by\r\nCicero.--(2.) A boat rowed by two oars.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISSEXTUS ANNUS. [CALENDARIUM, ROMAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎĒDRŎMĬA (βοηδρόμια), a festival celebrated at Athens on the seventh\r\nday of the month Boëdromion, in honour of Apollo Boëdromius. The name\r\nBoëdromius, by which Apollo was called in Boeotia and many other\r\nparts of Greece, seems to indicate that by this festival he was\r\nhonoured as a martial god, who, either by his actual presence or by\r\nhis oracles, afforded assistance in the dangers of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOEŌTARCHĒS (βοιωτάρχης, or βοιωτάρχος), the name of the chief\r\nmagistrates of the Boeotian confederacy, chosen by the different\r\nstates. Their duties were chiefly of a military character. Each\r\nstate of the confederacy elected one boeotarch, the Thebans two.\r\nThe total number from the whole confederacy varied with the number\r\nof the independent states, but at the time of the Peloponnesian war\r\nthey appear to have been ten or twelve. The boeotarchs, when engaged\r\nin military service, formed a council of war, the decisions of which\r\nwere determined by a majority of votes, the president being one of\r\nthe two Theban boeotarchs, who commanded alternately. Their period of\r\nservice was a year, beginning about the winter solstice; and whoever\r\ncontinued in office longer than his time was punishable with death,\r\nboth at Thebes and in other cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎNA, property. The phrase _in bonis_ is frequently used as opposed\r\nto _dominium_ or _Quiritarian ownership_ (_ex jure Quiritium_). The\r\nownership of certain kinds of things among the Romans could only be\r\ntransferred from one person to another with certain formalities, or\r\nacquired by usucapion (that is, the uninterrupted possession of a\r\nthing for a certain time). But if it was clearly the intention of\r\nthe owner to transfer the ownership, and the necessary forms only\r\nwere wanting, the purchaser had the thing _in bonis_, and he had\r\nthe enjoyment of it, though the original owner was still _legally_\r\nthe owner, and was said to have the thing _ex jure Quiritium_,\r\nnotwithstanding he had parted with the thing. The person who\r\npossessed a thing _in bonis_ was protected in the enjoyment of it\r\nby the praetor, and consequently after a time would obtain the\r\nQuiritarian ownership of it by usucapion. [USUCAPIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎNA CĂDŪCA. _Caducum_ literally signifies that which falls: thus\r\n_glans caduca_ is the mast which falls from a tree. The strict legal\r\nsense of _caducum_ and _bona caduca_ is as follows:--If a thing is\r\nleft by testament to a person, so that he can take it by the jus\r\ncivile, but from some cause has not taken it, that thing is called\r\n_caducum_, as if it had _fallen_ from him. Or if a _heres ex parte_,\r\nor a legatee, died before the opening of the will, the thing was\r\n_caducum_. That which was caducum came, in the first place, to\r\nthose among the heredes who had children; and if the heredes had\r\nno children, it came among those of the legatees who had children.\r\nIn case there was no prior claimant the caducum belonged to the\r\naerarium; and subsequently to the fiscus. [AERARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎNA FĬDES implies, generally speaking, the absence of all fraud and\r\nunfair dealing or acting. In various actions arising out of mutual\r\ndealings, such as buying and selling, lending and hiring, partnership\r\nand others, bona fides is equivalent to aequum and justum; and such\r\nactions were sometimes called bonae fidei actiones. The formula of\r\nthe praetor, which was the authority of the judex, empowered him\r\nin such cases to inquire and determine _ex bona fide_, that is,\r\naccording to the real merits of the case: sometimes aequius melius\r\nwas used instead of ex bona fide.\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎNŌRUM CESSĬO. There were two kinds of bonorum cessio, _in jure_\r\nand _extra jus_. The _in jure cessio_ was a mode of transferring\r\nownership by means of a fictitious suit. The _bonorum cessio extra\r\njus_ was introduced by a Julian law, passed either in the time of\r\nJulius Caesar or Augustus, which allowed an insolvent debtor to give\r\nup his property to his creditors. The debtor thus avoided the infamia\r\nconsequent on the bonorum emtio, which was involuntary, and he was\r\nfree from all personal execution. He was also allowed to retain a\r\nsmall portion of his property for his support. The property thus\r\ngiven up was sold, and the proceeds distributed among the creditors.\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎNŌRUM COLLĀTĬO. By the strict rules of the civil law an emancipated\r\nson had no right to the inheritance of his father, whether he died\r\ntestate or intestate. But, in course of time, the praetor granted to\r\nemancipated children the privilege of equal succession with those who\r\nremained in the power of the father at the time of his death; but\r\nonly on condition that they should bring into one common stock with\r\ntheir father’s property, and for the purpose of an equal division\r\namong all the father’s children, whatever property they had at the\r\ntime of the father’s death, and which would have been acquired for\r\nthe father in case they had still remained in his power. This was\r\ncalled bonorum collatio.\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎNŌRUM EMTĬO ET EMTOR. The expression bonorum emtio applies to a\r\nsale of the property either of a living or of a dead person. It\r\nwas in effect, as to a living debtor, an execution. In the case of\r\na dead person, his property was sold when it was ascertained that\r\nthere was neither heres nor bonorum possessor, nor any other person\r\nentitled to succeed to it. In the case of the property of a living\r\nperson being sold, the praetor, on the application of the creditors,\r\nordered it to be possessed (_possideri_) by the creditors for thirty\r\nsuccessive days, and notice to be given of the sale. This explains\r\nthe expression in Livy (ii. 24): “ne quis militis, donec in castris\r\nesset, bona _possideret_ aut venderet.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎNŌRUM POSSESSĬO was the right of suing for or retaining a patrimony\r\nor thing which belonged to another at the time of his death. The\r\nbonorum possessio was given by the edict both _contra tabulas_,\r\n_secundum tabulas_, and _intestati_. 1. An emancipated son had\r\nno legal claim on the inheritance of his father; but if he was\r\nomitted in his father’s will, or not expressly exheredated, the\r\npraetor’s edict gave him the bonorum possessio contra tabulas, on\r\ncondition that he would bring into hotchpot (_bonorum collatio_)\r\nwith his brethren who continued in the parent’s power, whatever\r\nproperty he had at the time of the parent’s death. 2. The _bonorum\r\npossessio secundum tabulas_ was that possession which the praetor\r\ngave, conformably to the words of the will, to those named in it as\r\nheredes, when there was no person intitled to make a claim against\r\nthe will, or none who chose to make such a claim. 3. In the case of\r\nintestacy (_intestati_) there were seven degrees of persons who might\r\nclaim the bonorum possessio, each in his order, upon there being\r\nno claim of a prior degree. The first three degrees were children,\r\n_legitimi heredes_, and _proximi cognati_. Emancipated children could\r\nclaim as well as those who were not emancipated, and adoptive as well\r\nas children of the blood; but not children who had been adopted into\r\nanother family. If a freedman died intestate, leaving only a wife\r\n(in manu) or an adoptive son, the patron was entitled to the bonorum\r\npossessio of one half of his property.\r\n\r\n\r\nBŎŌNAE (βοῶναι), persons in Athens who purchased oxen for the\r\npublic sacrifices and feasts. They are spoken of by Demosthenes\r\nin conjunction with the ἱεροποιοί and those who presided over the\r\nmysteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORĔASMUS (βορεασμός or βορεασμοί), a festival celebrated by the\r\nAthenians in honour of Boreas, which, as Herodotus seems to think,\r\nwas instituted during the Persian war, when the Athenians, being\r\ncommanded by an oracle to invoke their γαμβρὸς ἐπίκουρος, prayed to\r\nBoreas. But considering that Boreas was intimately connected with\r\nthe early history of Attica, we have reason to suppose that even\r\nprevious to the Persian wars certain honours were paid to him, which\r\nwere perhaps only revived and increased after the event recorded by\r\nHerodotus. The festival, however, does not seem ever to have had any\r\ngreat celebrity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOULĒ (βουλή--ἡ τῶν πεντακοσίων). In the heroic ages, represented to\r\nus by Homer, the _boulé_ is simply an aristocratical council of the\r\nelders amongst the nobles, sitting under their king as president,\r\nwhich decided on public business and judicial matters, frequently in\r\nconnection with, but apparently not subject to an _agora_, or meeting\r\nof the freemen of the state. [AGORA.] This form of government, though\r\nit existed for some time in the Ionian, Aeolian, and Achaean states,\r\nwas at last wholly abolished in these states. Among the Dorians,\r\nhowever, especially among the Spartans, this was not the case, for\r\nthey retained the kingly power of the Heracleidae, in conjunction\r\nwith the _Gerousia_ or assembly of elders, of which the kings were\r\nmembers. [GEROUSIA.] At Athens on the contrary, the _boulé_ was a\r\nrepresentative, and in most respects a popular body (δημοτικόν). The\r\nfirst institution of the Athenian _boulé_ is generally attributed to\r\nSolon; but there are strong reasons for supposing that, as in the\r\ncase of the _Areiopagus_, he merely modified the constitution of a\r\nbody which he found already existing. But be this as it may, it is\r\nadmitted that Solon made the number of his _boulé_ 400, 100 from\r\neach of the four tribes. When the number of the tribes was raised\r\nto ten by Cleisthenes (B.C. 510), the council also was increased to\r\n500, fifty being taken from each of the ten tribes. The _bouleutae_\r\n(βουλευταί) or councillors were appointed by lot, and hence they are\r\ncalled councillors made by the bean (οἱ ἀπὸ τοῦ κυάμου βουλευταί),\r\nfrom the use of beans in drawing lots. They were required to submit\r\nto a scrutiny or _docimasia_, in which they gave evidence of being\r\ngenuine citizens, of never having lost their civic rights by\r\n_atimia_, and also of being above 30 years of age. They remained\r\nin office for a year, receiving a drachma (μισθὸς βουλευτικός) for\r\neach day on which they sat: and independent of the general account\r\n(εὐθύναι), which the whole body had to give at the end of the year,\r\nany single member was liable to expulsion for misconduct by his\r\ncolleagues. The senate of 500 was divided into ten sections of fifty\r\neach, the members of which were called _prytanes_ (πρυτάνεις), and\r\nwere all of the same tribe; they acted as presidents both of the\r\ncouncil and the assemblies during thirty-five or thirty-six days,\r\nas the case might be, so as to complete the lunar year of 354 days\r\n(12×29½). Each tribe exercised these functions in turn; the period\r\nof office was called a _prytany_ (πρυτανεία), and the tribe that\r\npresided the _presiding tribe_; the order in which the tribes\r\npresided was determined by lot, and the four supernumerary days were\r\ngiven to the tribes which came last in order. Moreover, to obviate\r\nthe difficulty of having too many in office at once, every fifty\r\nwas subdivided into five bodies of ten each; its prytany also being\r\nportioned out into five periods of seven days each; so that only ten\r\nsenators presided for a week over the rest, and were thence called\r\n_proedri_ (πρόεδροι). Again, out of these proedri an _epistates_\r\n(ἐπιστάτης) was chosen for one day to preside as a chairman in the\r\nsenate, and the assembly of the people; during his day of office\r\nhe kept the public records and seal. The prytanes had the right of\r\nconvening the council and the assembly (ἐκκλησία). The duty of the\r\nproedri and their president was to propose subjects for discussion,\r\nand to take the votes both of the councillors and the people;\r\nfor neglect of their duty they were liable to a fine. Moreover,\r\nwhenever a meeting, either of the council or of the assembly, was\r\nconvened, the chairman of the proedri selected by lot nine others,\r\none from each of the non-presiding tribes; these also were called\r\nproedri, and possessed a chairman of their own, likewise appointed\r\nby lot from among themselves. But the proedri who proposed the\r\nsubject for discussion to the assembly belonged to the presiding\r\ntribe. It is observed, under AREIOPAGUS, that the chief object of\r\nSolon, in forming the senate and the areiopagus, was to control the\r\ndemocratical powers of the state: for this purpose he ordained that\r\nthe senate should discuss and vote upon all matters before they were\r\nsubmitted to the assembly, so that nothing could be laid before the\r\npeople on which the senate had not come to a previous decision.\r\nThis decision, or bill, was called _probouleuma_ (προβούλευμα); but\r\nthen not only might this _probouleuma_ be rejected or modified by\r\nthe assembly, but the latter also possessed and exercised the power\r\nof coming to a decision completely different from the will of the\r\nsenate. In addition to the bills which it was the duty of the senate\r\nto propose of their own accord, there were others of a different\r\ncharacter, viz. such as any private individual might wish to have\r\nsubmitted to the people. To accomplish this, it was first necessary\r\nfor the party to obtain, by petition, the privilege of access to\r\nthe senate, and leave to propose his motion; and if the measure met\r\nwith their approbation, he could then submit it to the assembly. A\r\nproposal of this kind, which had the sanction of the senate, was\r\nalso called _probouleuma_, and frequently related to the conferring\r\nof some particular honour or privilege upon an individual. Thus the\r\nproposal of Ctesiphon for crowning Demosthenes is so styled. In the\r\nassembly the bill of the senate was first read, perhaps by the crier,\r\nafter the introductory ceremonies were over; and then the proedri put\r\nthe question to the people, whether they approved of it. The people\r\ndeclared their will by a show of hands (προχειροτονία). If it was\r\nconfirmed it became a _psephisma_ (ψήφισμα), or decree of the people,\r\nbinding upon all classes. The form for drawing up such decrees varied\r\nin different ages. In the time of Demosthenes the decrees commence\r\nwith the name of the archon; then come the day of the month, the\r\ntribe in office, and, lastly, the name of the proposer. The motive\r\nfor passing the decree is next stated; and then follows the decree\r\nitself, prefaced with the formula δεδόχθαι τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῷ δήμῳ.\r\nThe senate-house was called _Bouleuterion_ (βουλευτηριον). The\r\nprytanes also had a building to hold their meetings in, where they\r\nwere entertained at the public expense during their prytany. This\r\nwas called the _Prytaneion_, and was used for a variety of purposes.\r\n[PRYTANEION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRĀCAE, or BRACCAE (ἀναξυρίδες), trowsers, pantaloons, were common\r\nto all the nations which encircled the Greek and Roman population,\r\nextending from the Indian to the Atlantic ocean, but were not worn\r\nby the Greeks and Romans themselves. Accordingly the monuments\r\ncontaining representations of people different from the Greeks and\r\nRomans exhibit them in trowsers, thus distinguishing them from the\r\nlatter people.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAURŌNĬA (βραυρώνια), a festival celebrated in honour of Artemis\r\nBrauronia, in the Attic town of Brauron, where Orestes and\r\nIphigeneia, on their return from Tauris, were supposed by the\r\nAthenians to have landed, and left the statue of the Taurian goddess.\r\nIt was held every fifth year, and the chief solemnity consisted in\r\nthe Attic girls between the ages of five and ten years going in\r\nsolemn procession to the sanctuary, where they were consecrated to\r\nthe goddess. During this act the priests sacrificed a goat, and the\r\ngirls performed a propitiatory rite, in which they imitated bears.\r\nThis rite may have simply risen from the circumstance that the bear\r\nwas sacred to Artemis, especially in Arcadia. There was also a\r\nquinquennial festival called Brauronia, which was celebrated by men\r\nand dissolute women, at Brauron, in honour of Dionysus.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUTTĬĀNI, slaves whose duty it was to wait upon the Roman\r\nmagistrates. They are said to have been originally taken from among\r\nthe Bruttians.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCCĬNA (βυκάνη), a kind of horn trumpet, anciently made out of a\r\nshell (_buccinum_), the form of which is exhibited in the specimen\r\nannexed. The _buccina_ was distinct from the _cornu_; but it is\r\noften confounded with it. The buccina seems to have been chiefly\r\ndistinguished by the twisted form of the shell, from which it was\r\noriginally made. In later times it was carved from horn, and perhaps\r\nfrom wood or metal, so as to imitate the shell. The _buccina_ was\r\nchiefly used to proclaim the watches of the day and of the night,\r\nhence called _buccina prima_, _secunda_, &c. It was also blown at\r\nfunerals, and at festive entertainments both before sitting down to\r\ntable and after.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buccina, Trumpet. (Blanchini, De Mus. Instrum. Vet.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLA, a circular plate or boss of metal, so called from its\r\nresemblance in form to a bubble floating upon water. Bright studs\r\nof this description were used to adorn the sword belt; but we most\r\nfrequently read of _bullae_ as ornaments worn by children, suspended\r\nfrom the neck, and especially by the sons of the noble and wealthy.\r\nSuch an one is called _heres bullatus_ by Juvenal. The bulla was\r\nusually made of thin plates of gold. The use of the bulla, like that\r\nof the praetexta, was derived from the Etruscans. It was originally\r\nworn only by the children of the patricians, but subsequently by all\r\nof free birth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bulla. (From the Collection of Mr. Rogers; the gold\r\nchord added from a specimen in the Brit. Mus.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBŪRIS. [ARATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSTUM. It was customary among the Romans to burn the bodies of the\r\ndead before burying them. When the spot appointed for that purpose\r\nadjoined the place of sepulture, it was termed _bustum_; when it\r\nwas separate from it, it was called _ustrina_. From this word the\r\ngladiators, who were hired to fight round the burning pyre of the\r\ndeceased, were called _bustuarii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUXUM or BUXUS, probably means the wood of the box-tree, but was\r\ngiven as a name to many things made of this wood. The tablets used\r\nfor writing on, and covered with wax (_tabulae ceratae_), were\r\nusually made of box. In the same way the Greek πυξίον, formed from\r\nπύξος, “box-wood,” came to be applied to any tablets, whether they\r\nwere made of this wood or any other substance. Tops and combs were\r\nmade of box-wood, and also all wind instruments, especially the flute.\r\n\r\n\r\nBYSSUS (βύσσος), linen, and not cotton. The word byssus appears to\r\ncome from the Hebrew _butz_, and the Greeks probably got it through\r\nthe Phoenicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂBEIRĬA (καβείρια), mysteries, festivals, and orgies, solemnised\r\nin all places in which the Pelasgian Cabeiri were worshipped, but\r\nespecially in Samothrace, Imbros, Lemnos, Thebes, Anthedon, Pergamus,\r\nand Berytos. Little is known respecting the rites observed in these\r\nmysteries, as no one was allowed to divulge them. The most celebrated\r\nwere those of the island of Samothrace, which, if we may judge from\r\nthose of Lemnos, were solemnised every year, and lasted for nine\r\ndays. Persons on their admission seem to have undergone a sort of\r\nexamination respecting the life they had led hitherto, and were then\r\npurified of all their crimes, even if they had committed murder.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĀDŪCĔUS (κηρύκειον, κηρύκιον), the staff or mace carried by heralds\r\nand ambassadors in time of war. This name is also given to the staff\r\nwith which Hermes or Mercury is usually represented, as is shown in\r\nthe following figure of that god. From _caduceus_ was formed the\r\nword _caduceator_, which signified a person sent to treat of peace.\r\nThe persons of the caduceatores were considered sacred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hermes bearing the Caduceus. (Museo Borbonico, vol.\r\nvi. pl. 2.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂDŪCUM. [BONA CADUCA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂDUS (κάδος, κάδδος), a large vessel usually made of earthenware,\r\nwhich was used for keeping wine, drawing water, &c. The name of\r\ncadus was sometimes given to the vessel or urn in which the counters\r\nor pebbles of the dicasts were put, when they gave their vote on a\r\ntrial, but the diminutive καδίσκος was more commonly used in this\r\nsignification.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAELĀTŪRA (τορευτική), a branch of the fine arts, under which all\r\nsorts of ornamental work in metal, except actual statues, appear to\r\nbe included. The principal processes, which these words were used\r\nto designate, seem to have been of three kinds: hammering metal\r\nplates into moulds or dies, so as to bring out a raised pattern;\r\nengraving the surface of metals with a sharp tool; and working a\r\npattern of one metal upon or into the surface of another: in short,\r\nthe various processes which we describe by the words _chasing_,\r\n_damascening_, &c. The objects on which the _caelator_ exercised his\r\nart were chiefly weapons and armour--especially shields, chariots,\r\ntripods, and other votive offerings, quoits, candelabra, thrones,\r\ncurule chairs, mirrors, goblets, dishes, and all kinds of gold and\r\nsilver plate. The ornamental work with which the chaser decorated\r\nsuch objects consisted either of simple running patterns, chiefly in\r\nimitation of plants and flowers, or of animals, or of mythological\r\nsubjects, and, for armour, of battles. The mythological subjects\r\nwere reserved for the works of the greatest masters of the art: they\r\nwere generally executed in very high relief (_anaglypha_). In the\r\nfinest works, the ornamental pattern was frequently distinct from\r\nthe vessel, to which it was either fastened permanently, or so that\r\nit could be removed at pleasure, the vessel being of silver, and the\r\nornaments of gold, _crustae aut emblemata_. The art of ornamental\r\nmetal-work was in an advanced stage of progress among the Greeks of\r\nthe heroic period, as we see from numerous passages of Homer: but its\r\norigin, in the high artistic sense, is to be ascribed to Phidias,\r\nand its complete development to Polycletus. In the last age of the\r\nRoman Republic, the prevailing wealth and luxury, and the presence of\r\nGreek artists at Rome, combined to bring the art more than ever into\r\nrequisition. After this period it suddenly fell into disuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAELĬBĀTUS. [AES UXORIUM; LEX JULIA ET PAPIA POPPAEA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAERĬTUM TĂBŬLAE. [AERARII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAESAR, a title of the Roman emperors, was originally a family name\r\nof the Julia gens; it was assumed by Octavianus as the adopted son\r\nof the great dictator, C. Julius Caesar, and was by him handed down\r\nto his adopted son Tiberius. It continued to be used by Caligula,\r\nClaudius, and Nero, as members either by adoption or female descent\r\nof Caesar’s family; but although the family became extinct with\r\nNero, succeeding emperors still retained the name as part of their\r\ntitles, and it was the practice to prefix it to their own names, as\r\nfor instance, _Imperator Caesar Domitianus Augustus_. When Hadrian\r\nadopted Aelius Varus, he allowed the latter to take the title of\r\nCaesar; and from this time, though the title of _Augustus_ continued\r\nto be confined to the reigning emperor, that of _Caesar_ was also\r\ngranted to the second person in the state and the heir presumptive to\r\nthe throne. [AUGUSTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLĂMISTRUM, an instrument made of iron, and hollow like a reed\r\n(_calamus_), used for curling the hair. For this purpose it was\r\nheated, the person who performed the office of heating it in wood\r\nashes (_cinis_) being called _ciniflo_, or _cinerarius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLĂMUS, a sort of reed which the ancients used as a pen for writing.\r\nThe best sorts were got from Aegypt and Cnidus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLANTĬCA. [COMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLĂTHUS (κάλαθος, also called τάλαρος), usually signified the basket\r\nin which women placed their work, and especially the materials for\r\nspinning. In the following cut a slave, belonging to the class called\r\n_quasillariae_, is presenting her mistress with the calathus.\r\nBaskets of this kind were also used for other purposes, such as for\r\ncarrying fruits, flowers, &c. The name of calathi was also given to\r\ncups for holding wine. Calathus was properly a Greek word, though\r\nused by the Latin writers. The Latin word corresponding to it was\r\n_qualus_ or _quasillus_. From _quasillus_ came _quasillaria_, the\r\nname of the slave who spun, and who was considered the meanest of the\r\nfemale slaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slave presenting a Calathus. (From a Painting on a\r\nVase.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCĔUS, CALCĔĀMEN, CALCĔĀMENTUM (ὑποδήμα, πέδιλον), a shoe or boot,\r\nanything adapted to cover and preserve the feet in walking. The use\r\nof shoes was by no means universal among the Greeks and Romans. The\r\nHomeric heroes are represented without shoes when armed for battle.\r\nSocrates, Phocion, and Cato, frequently went barefoot. The Roman\r\nslaves had no shoes. The covering of the feet was removed before\r\nreclining at meals. People in grief, as for instance at funerals,\r\nfrequently went barefooted. Shoes may be divided into those in which\r\nthe mere sole of a shoe was attached to the sole of the foot by\r\nties or bands, or by a covering for the toes or the instep [SOLEA;\r\nCREPIDA; SOCCUS]; and those which ascended higher and higher,\r\naccording as they covered the ankles, the calf, or the whole of the\r\nleg. To calceamenta of the latter kind, _i.e._ to shoes and boots,\r\nas distinguished from sandals and slippers, the term _calceus_ was\r\napplied in its proper and restricted sense. There were also other\r\nvarieties of the _calceus_ according to its adaptation to particular\r\nprofessions or modes of life. Thus the CALIGA was principally worn\r\nby soldiers; the PERO by labourers and rustics; and the COTHURNUS\r\nby tragedians, hunters, and horsemen. The _calcei_ probably did\r\nnot much differ from our shoes, and are exemplified in a painting\r\nat Herculaneum, which represents a female wearing bracelets, a\r\nwreath of ivy, and a panther’s skin, while she is in the attitude\r\nof dancing and playing on the cymbals. The form and colour of the\r\ncalceus indicated rank and office. Roman senators wore high shoes\r\nlike buskins, fastened in front with four black thongs. They were\r\nalso sometimes adorned with a small crescent: we do not find on any\r\nancient statues the crescent, but we may regard the bottom right hand\r\nfigure in the annexed cut as representing the shoe of a senator.\r\nAmong the calcei worn by senators, those called _mullei_, from their\r\nresemblance to the scales of the red mullet, were particularly\r\nadmired; as well as others called _alutae_, because the leather was\r\nsoftened by the use of alum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Greek Shoes. (From ancient Vases.)\r\n\r\nRoman Shoes. (Museo Borbonico.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCŬLĀTOR (λογιστής), a keeper of accounts in general, and also a\r\nteacher of arithmetic. In Roman families of importance there was a\r\n_calculator_ or account-keeper, who is, however, more frequently\r\ncalled by the name of _dispensator_, or procurator: he was a kind of\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCŬLI, little stones or pebbles, used for various purposes, as,\r\nfor instance, among the Athenians for voting. Calculi were used\r\nin playing a sort of draughts. Subsequently, instead of pebbles,\r\nivory, or silver, or gold, or other men (as we call them) were used;\r\nbut they still bore the name of calculi. Calculi were also used\r\nin reckoning; and hence the phrases _calculum ponere_, _calculum\r\nsubducere_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALDĀRĬUM. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLENDAE or KĂLENDAE. [CALENDARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLENDĀRĬUM or KĂLENDĀRĬUM, generally signified an account-book,\r\nin which were entered the names of a person’s debtors, with the\r\ninterest which they had to pay, and it was so called because the\r\ninterest had to be paid on the calends of each month. The word,\r\nhowever, was also used in the signification of a modern calendar or\r\nalmanac. (1) GREEK CALENDAR. The Greek year was divided into twelve\r\nlunar months, depending on the actual changes of the moon. The first\r\nday of the month (νουμηνία) was not the day of the conjunction, but\r\nthe day on the evening of which the new moon appeared; consequently\r\nfull moon was the middle of the month. The lunar month consists of\r\ntwenty-nine days and about thirteen hours; accordingly some months\r\nwere necessarily reckoned at twenty-nine days, and rather more of\r\nthem at thirty days. The latter were called _full_ months (πληρεῖς),\r\nthe former _hollow_ months (κοῖλοι). As the twelve lunar months\r\nfell short of the solar year, they were obliged every other year\r\nto interpolate an intercalary month (μὴν ἐμβολιμαῖος) of thirty or\r\ntwenty-nine days. The ordinary year consisted of 354 days, and the\r\ninterpolated year, therefore, of 384 or 383. This interpolated year\r\n(τριέτηρις) was seven days and a half too long, and to correct the\r\nerror, the intercalary month was from time to time omitted. The Attic\r\nyear began with the summer solstice: the following is the sequence of\r\nthe Attic months and the number of days in each:--Hecatombaeon (30),\r\nMetageitnion (29), Boedromion (30), Pyanepsion (29), Maemacterion\r\n(30), Poseideon (29), Gamelion (30), Anthesterion (29), Elaphebolion\r\n(30), Munychion (29), Thargelion (30), Scirophorion (29). The\r\nintercalary month was a second Poseideon inserted in the middle of\r\nthe year. Every Athenian month was divided into three decads. The\r\ndays of the first decad were designated as ἱσταμένου or ἀρχομένου\r\nμηνος, and were counted on regularly from one to ten; thus, δευτέρα\r\nἀρχομένου or ἱσταμένου is “the second day of the month.” The days\r\nof the second decad were designated as ἐπὶ δέκα or μεσοῦντος, and\r\nwere counted on regularly from the 11th to the 20th day, which was\r\ncalled εἴκας. There were two ways of counting the days of the last\r\ndecad; they were either reckoned onwards from the 20th (thus, πρώτη\r\nἐπὶ εἰκάδι was the 21st), or backwards from the last day, with\r\nthe addition φθίνοντος, παυομένου, λήγοντος, or ἀπίοντος; thus,\r\nthe twenty-first day of a hollow month was ἐνάτη φθίνοντος; of a\r\nfull month, δεκάτη φθίνοντος. The last day of the month was called\r\nἕνη καὶ νέα, “the old and new,” because as the lunar month really\r\nconsisted of more than twenty-nine and less than thirty days, the\r\nlast day might be considered as belonging equally to the old and\r\nnew month. Separate years were designated at Athens by the name of\r\nthe chief archon, hence called _archon eponymus_ (ἄρχων ἐπώνυμος),\r\nor “the name giving archon;” at Sparta, by the first of the ephors;\r\nat Argos, by the priestess of JUNO, &c.--(2) ROMAN CALENDAR. The\r\nold Roman, frequently called the Romulian year, consisted of only\r\nten months, which were called Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius,\r\nQuinctilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, December. That\r\nMarch was the first month in the year is implied in the last six\r\nnames. Of these months, four, namely, Martius, Maius, Quinctilis,\r\nand October, consisted of thirty-one days, the other six of thirty.\r\nThe four former were distinguished in the latest form of the Roman\r\ncalendar by having their nones two days later than any of the other\r\nmonths. The symmetry of this arrangement will appear by placing the\r\nnumbers in succession:--31, 30; 31, 30; 31, 30, 30; 31, 30, 30.\r\nThe Romulian year therefore consisted of 304 days, and contained\r\nthirty-eight nundinae or weeks; every eighth day, under the name of\r\n_nonae_, or _nundinae_, being especially devoted to religious and\r\nother public purposes. Hence we find that the number of _dies fasti_\r\nafterwards retained in the Julian calendar tally exactly with these\r\nthirty-eight nundines; besides which, it may be observed that a year\r\nof 304 days bears to a solar year of 365 days nearly the ratio of\r\nfive to six, six of the Romulian years containing 1824, five of the\r\nsolar years 1825 days; and hence we may explain the origin of the\r\nwell-known quinquennial period called the lustrum, which ancient\r\nwriters expressly call an _annus magnus_; that is, in the modern\r\nlanguage of chronology, a cycle. It was consequently the period at\r\nwhich the Romulian and solar years coincided. The next division of\r\nthe Roman year was said to have been made by Numa Pompilius, who\r\ninstituted a lunar year of 12 months and 355 days. Livy says that\r\nNuma so regulated his lunar year of twelve months by the insertion\r\nof intercalary months, that at the end of every _nineteenth_ year\r\n(_vicesimo anno_) it again coincided with the same point in the\r\nsun’s course from which it started. It is well known that 19 years\r\nconstitute a most convenient cycle for the junction of a lunar and\r\nsolar year. It seems certain that the Romans continued to use a lunar\r\nyear for some time after the establishment of the republic; and it\r\nwas probably at the time of the decemviral legislation that the\r\nlunar year was abandoned. By the change which was then made the year\r\nconsisted of 12 months, the length of each of which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Martius,      31 days.\r\n  Aprilis,      29   ”\r\n  Maius,        31   ”\r\n  Junius,       29   ”\r\n  Quinctilis,   31   ”\r\n  Sextilis,     29   ”\r\n  September,    29   ”\r\n  October,      31   ”\r\n  November,     29   ”\r\n  December,     29   ”\r\n  Januarius,    29   ”\r\n  Februarius,   28   ”\r\n\r\nThe year thus consisted of 355 days, and this was made to correspond\r\nwith the solar year by the insertion of an intercalary month\r\n(_mensis intercalaris_ or _intercalarius_), called _Mercedonius_\r\nor _Mercidonius_. This month of 22 or 23 days seems to have been\r\ninserted in alternate years. As the festivals of the Romans were for\r\nthe most part dependent upon the calendar, the regulation of the\r\nlatter was entrusted to the college of pontifices, who in early times\r\nwere chosen exclusively from the body of patricians. It was therefore\r\nin the power of the college to add to their other means of oppressing\r\nthe plebeians, by keeping to themselves the knowledge of the days on\r\nwhich justice could be administered, and assemblies of the people\r\ncould be held. In the year 304 B.C., one Cn. Flavius, a secretary\r\n(_scriba_) of Appius Claudius, is said fraudulently to have made the\r\n_Fasti_ public. The other privilege of regulating the year by the\r\ninsertion of the intercalary month gave the pontiffs great political\r\npower, which they were not backward to employ. Every thing connected\r\nwith the matter of intercalation was left to their unrestrained\r\npleasure; and the majority of them, on personal grounds, added to or\r\ntook from the year by capricious intercalations, so as to lengthen or\r\nshorten the period during which a magistrate remained in office, and\r\nseriously to benefit or injure the farmer of the public revenue. The\r\ncalendar was thus involved in complete confusion, and accordingly we\r\nfind that in the time of Cicero the year was three months in advance\r\nof the real solar year. At length, in the year B.C. 46, Caesar, now\r\nmaster of the Roman world, employed his authority, as pontifex\r\nmaximus, in the correction of this serious evil. The account of the\r\nway in which he effected this is given by Censorinus:--“The confusion\r\nwas at last carried so far that C. Caesar, the pontifex maximus, in\r\nhis third consulate, with Lepidus for his colleague, inserted between\r\nNovember and December two intercalary months of 67 days, the month\r\nof February having already received an intercalation of 23 days, and\r\nthus made the whole year to consist of 445 days. At the same time he\r\nprovided against a repetition of similar errors, by casting aside\r\nthe intercalary month, and adapting the year to the sun’s course.\r\nAccordingly, to the 355 days of the previously existing year he added\r\nten days, which he so distributed between the seven months having\r\n29 days that January, Sextilis, and December received two each, the\r\nothers but one; and these additional days he placed at the end of\r\nthe several months, no doubt with the wish not to remove the various\r\nfestivals from those positions in the several months which they had\r\nso long occupied. Hence in the present calendar, although there are\r\nseven months of 31 days, yet the four months, which from the first\r\npossessed that number, are still distinguishable by having their\r\nnones on the seventh, the rest having them on the fifth of the month.\r\nLastly, in consideration of the quarter of a day, which he regarded\r\nas completing the true year, he established the rule that, at the\r\nend of every four years, a single day should be intercalated, where\r\nthe month had been hitherto inserted, that is, immediately after the\r\nterminalia; which day is now called the _bissextum_.” The mode of\r\ndenoting the days of the month will cause no difficulty, if it be\r\nrecollected that the kalends always denote the first of the month;\r\nthat the nones occur on the seventh of the four months of March,\r\nMay, Quinctilis or July, and October, and on the fifth of the other\r\nmonths; that the ides always fall eight days later than the nones;\r\nand lastly, that the intermediate days are in all cases reckoned\r\nbackwards upon the Roman principle of counting both extremes. For the\r\nmonth of January the notation will be as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. Kal. Jan.\r\n  2. a. d. IV. Non. Jan.\r\n  3. a. d. III. Non. Jan.\r\n  4. Prid. Non. Jan.\r\n  5. Non. Jan.\r\n  6. a. d. VIII. Id. Jan.\r\n  7. a. d. VII. Id. Jan.\r\n  8. a. d. VI. Id. Jan.\r\n  9. a. d. V. Id. Jan.\r\n  10. a. d. IV. Id. Jan.\r\n  11. a. d. III. Id. Jan.\r\n  12. Prid. Id. Jan.\r\n  13. Id. Jan.\r\n  14. a. d. XIX. Kal. Feb.\r\n  15. a. d. XVIII. Kal. Feb.\r\n  16. a. d. XVII. Kal. Feb.\r\n  17. a. d. XVI. Kal. Feb.\r\n  18. a. d. XV. Kal. Feb.\r\n  19. a. d. XIV. Kal. Feb.\r\n  20. a. d. XIII. Kal. Feb.\r\n  21. a. d. XII. Kal. Feb.\r\n  22. a. d. XI. Kal. Feb.\r\n  23. a. d. X. Kal. Feb.\r\n  24. a. d. IX. Kal. Feb.\r\n  25. a. d. VIII. Kal. Feb.\r\n  26. a. d. VII. Kal. Feb.\r\n  27. a. d. VI. Kal. Feb.\r\n  28. a. d. V. Kal. Feb.\r\n  29. a. d. IV. Kal. Feb.\r\n  30. a. d. III. Kal. Feb.\r\n  31. Prid. Kal. Feb.\r\n\r\nThe letters _a d_ are often, through error, written together, and so\r\nconfounded with the preposition _ad_ which would have a different\r\nmeaning, for _ad kalendas_ would signify _by_, i.e. _on or before\r\nthe kalends_. The letters are in fact an abridgment of _ante diem_,\r\nand the full phrase for “on the second of January,” would be _ante\r\ndiem quartum nonas Januarias_. The word _ante_ in this expression\r\nseems really to belong in sense to _nonas_, and to be the cause why\r\n_nonas_ is an accusative. Whether the phrase _kalendae Januarii_ was\r\never used by the best writers is doubtful. The words are commonly\r\nabbreviated; and those passages where Aprilis, Decembris, &c. occur\r\nare of no avail, as they are probably accusatives. The _ante_ may be\r\nomitted, in which case the phrase will be _die quarto nonarum_. In\r\nthe leap year (to use a modern phrase), the last days of February\r\nwere called,--\r\n\r\n  Feb. 23. a. d. VII. Kal. Mart.\r\n  Feb. 24. a. d. VI. Kal. Mart. posteriorem.\r\n  Feb. 25. a. d. VI. Kal. Mart. priorem.\r\n  Feb. 26. a. d. V. Kal. Mart.\r\n  Feb. 27. a. d. IV. Kal. Mart.\r\n  Feb. 28. a. d. III. Kal. Mart.\r\n  Feb. 29. Prid. Kal. Mart.\r\n\r\nIn which the words _prior_ and _posterior_ are used in reference to\r\nthe retrograde direction of the reckoning. From the fact that the\r\nintercalated year has two days called _ante diem sextum_, the name\r\nbissextile has been applied to it. The term _annus bissextilis_,\r\nhowever, does not occur in any classical writer, but in place of\r\nit the phrase _annus bissextus_.--The names of two of the months\r\nwere changed in honour of Julius Caesar and Augustus. Julius was\r\nsubstituted for Quinctilis, the month in which Caesar was born, in\r\nthe second Julian year, that is, the year of the dictator’s death,\r\nfor the first Julian year was the first year of the _corrected_\r\nJulian calendar, that is, B.C. 45. The name Augustus in place of\r\nSextilis was introduced by the emperor himself in B.C. 27. The month\r\nof September in like manner received the name of Germanicus from\r\nthe general so called, and the appellation appears to have existed\r\neven in the time of Macrobius. Domitian, too, conferred his name\r\nupon October; but the old word was restored upon the death of the\r\ntyrant.--The Julian calendar supposes the mean tropical year to\r\nbe 365 d. 6 h.; but this exceeds the real amount by 11′ 12″, the\r\naccumulation of which, year after year, caused at last considerable\r\ninconvenience. Accordingly, in the year 1582, Pope Gregory XIII.\r\nagain reformed the calendar. The ten days by which the year had been\r\nunduly retarded were struck out by a regulation that the day after\r\nthe fourth of October in that year should be called the fifteenth;\r\nand it was ordered that whereas hitherto an intercalary day had been\r\ninserted every four years, for the future three such intercalations\r\nin the course of four hundred years should be omitted, viz., in\r\nthose years which are divisible without remainder by 100, but not by\r\n400. Thus, according to the Julian calendar, the years 1600, 1700,\r\n1800, 1900, 2000, were to be bissextile as before. The bull which\r\neffected this change was issued Feb. 24th, 1582. The Protestant parts\r\nof Europe resisted what they called a papistical invention for more\r\nthan a century. In England the Gregorian calendar was first adopted\r\nin 1752. In Russia, and those countries which belonged to the Greek\r\nchurch, the Julian year, or _old style_, as it is called, still\r\nprevails. In the ancient calendars the letters A, B, C, D, E, F,\r\nG, H, were used for the purpose of fixing the nundines in the week\r\nof eight days; precisely in the same way in which the first seven\r\nletters are still employed in ecclesiastical calendars, to mark the\r\ndays of the Christian week.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLĬGA, a strong and heavy sandal worn by the Roman soldiers, but\r\nnot by the superior officers. Hence the common soldiers, including\r\ncenturions, were distinguished by the name of _caligati_. The emperor\r\nCaligula received that cognomen when a boy, in consequence of wearing\r\nthe caliga, and being inured to the life of a common soldier. The\r\ncuts on pp. 1, 41, show the difference between the caliga of the\r\ncommon soldier and the calceus worn by men of higher rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLIX (κύλιξ). (1) a drinking-cup used at symposia and on similar\r\noccasions.--(2) A vessel used in cooking.--(3) A tube in the\r\naquaeducts attached to the extremity of each pipe, where it entered\r\nthe castellum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Calices, Drinking-cups. (Museo Borbonico, vol. v. pl.\r\n18.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLIS, a beaten path or track made by the feet of cattle. The\r\nsheep-walks in the mountainous parts of Campania and Apulia were\r\nthe property of the Roman state; and as they were of considerable\r\nvalue, one of the quaestors usually had these _calles_ assigned to\r\nhim as his province, whence we read of the _Callium provincia_. His\r\nprincipal duties were to receive the _scriptura_, or tax paid for\r\nthe pasturage of the cattle, and to protect life and property in\r\nthese wild and mountainous districts. When the senate wished to put\r\na slight upon the consuls on one occasion they endeavoured to assign\r\nto them as their provinces, the care of the woods (_silvae_) and\r\nsheep-walks (_calles_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLISTEIA (καλλιστεῖα), a festival, or perhaps merely a part of one,\r\nheld by the women of Lesbos; at which they assembled in the sanctuary\r\nof Hera, and the fairest received the prize of beauty. Similar\r\ncontests of beauty are said to have been held in other places.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĀLŌNES, the slaves or servants of the Roman soldiers, so called\r\nfrom carrying wood (κᾶλα) for their use. The word _calo_, however,\r\nwas also applied to farm-servants. The _calones_ and _lixae_ are\r\nfrequently spoken of together, but they were not the same: the latter\r\nwere freemen, who merely followed the camp for the purposes of gain\r\nand merchandise, and were so far from being indispensable to an army,\r\nthat they were sometimes forbidden to attend it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂLUMNĬA. When an accuser failed in his proof, and the accused\r\nparty was acquitted, there might be an inquiry into the conduct and\r\nmotives of the accuser. If the person who made this judicial inquiry\r\nfound that the accuser had merely acted from error of judgment, he\r\nacquitted him in the form _non probasti_; if he convicted him of evil\r\nintention, he declared his sentence in the words _calumniatus es_,\r\nwhich sentence was followed by the legal punishment. The punishment\r\nfor _calumnia_ was fixed by the lex Remmia, or as it is sometimes,\r\nperhaps incorrectly, named, the lex Memmia. But it is not known when\r\nthis lex was passed, nor what were its penalties. It appears from\r\nCicero, that the false accuser might be branded on the forehead with\r\nthe letter K, the initial of Kalumnia. The punishment for calumnia\r\nwas also _exsilium, relegatio in insulam_, or loss of rank (_ordinis\r\namissio_); but probably only in criminal cases, or in matters\r\nrelating to status.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂMĂRA (καμάρα), or CĂMĔRA. (1) A particular kind of arched\r\nceiling, formed by semicircular bands or beams of wood, arranged at\r\nsmall lateral distances, over which a coating of lath and plaster\r\nwas spread, and the whole covered in by a roof, resembling in\r\nconstruction the hooped awnings in use amongst us.--(2) A small boat\r\nused in early times by the people who inhabited the shores of the\r\nPalus Maeotis, capable of containing from twenty-five to thirty men.\r\nThese boats were made to work fore and aft, like the fast-sailing\r\nproas of the Indian seas, and continued in use until the age of\r\nTacitus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂMILLI, CĂMILLAE, boys and girls employed in the religious rites and\r\nceremonies of the Romans. They were required to be perfect in form,\r\nand sound in health, free born, and with both their parents alive;\r\nor, in other words, according to the expression of the Romans, _pueri\r\nseu puellae ingenui, felicissimi, patrimi matrimique_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂMĪNUS. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPESTRE (sc. _subligar_), a kind of girdle or apron, which the\r\nRoman youths wore around their loins, when they exercised naked in\r\nthe Campus Martius. The campestre was sometimes worn in warm weather,\r\nin place of the tunic under the toga.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPUS MARTĬUS. [See CLASSICAL DICTIONARY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂNĂBUS (κάναβος), a figure of wood in the form of a skeleton, round\r\nwhich the clay or plaster was laid in forming models. Figures of a\r\nsimilar kind, formed to display the muscles and veins, were studied\r\nby painters in order to acquire some knowledge of anatomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĀNATHRON (κάναθρον), a carriage, the upper part of which was made of\r\nbasket-work, or more properly the basket itself, which was fixed in\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANCELLĀRĬUS. [CANCELLI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANCELLI, lattice-work, placed before a window, a door-way, the\r\ntribunal of a judge, or any other place. Hence was derived the\r\nword _Cancellarius_, which originally signified a porter, who\r\nstood at the latticed or grated door of the emperor’s palace. The\r\ncancellarius also signified a legal scribe or secretary, who sat\r\nwithin the cancelli or lattice-work. The chief scribe or secretary\r\nwas called Cancellarius κατ’ ἐξοχήν, and was eventually invested with\r\njudicial power at Constantinople. From this word has come the modern\r\nChancellor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDĒLA, a candle, made either of wax (_cerea_), or tallow\r\n(_sebacea_), was used universally by the Romans before the invention\r\nof oil lamps (_lucernae_). In later times candelae were only used\r\nby the poorer classes; the houses of the more wealthy were always\r\nlighted by lucernae.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDĒLABRUM, originally a candlestick, but afterwards the name of a\r\nstand for supporting lamps (λυχνοῦχοι), in which signification it\r\nmost commonly occurs. The candelabra of this kind were usually made\r\nto stand upon the ground, and were of a considerable height. The\r\nmost common kind were made of wood; but those which have been found\r\nin Herculaneum and Pompeii are mostly of bronze. Sometimes they were\r\nmade of the more precious metals, and even of jewels. The candelabra\r\ndid not always stand upon the ground, but were also placed upon\r\nthe table. Such candelabra usually consisted of pillars, from the\r\ncapitals of which several lamps hung down, or of trees, from whose\r\nbranches lamps also were suspended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Candelabrum in the Vatican. (Visconti, vol. IV. tav.\r\n5.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDĬDĀTUS. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDYS (κάνδυς), a robe worn by the Medes and Persians over their\r\ntrowsers and other garments. It had wide sleeves, and was made of\r\nwoollen cloth, which was either purple or of some other splendid\r\ncolour. In the Persepolitan sculptures, from which the annexed\r\nfigures are taken, nearly all the principal personages wear it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Candys, Persian Cloak. (From Bas-relief at\r\nPersepolis.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂNĒPHŎROS (κανηφόρος), a virgin who carried a flat circular basket\r\n(κάνεον, _canistrum_) at sacrifices, in which the chaplet of flowers,\r\nthe knife to slay the victim, and sometimes the frankincense\r\nwere deposited. The name, however, was more particularly applied\r\nto two virgins of the first Athenian families who were appointed\r\nto officiate as canephori at the Panathaenaea. The preceding cut\r\nrepresents the two canephori approaching a candelabrum. Each of them\r\nelevates one arm to support the basket while she slightly raises her\r\ntunic with the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canephori. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTHĂRUS (κάνθαρος), a kind of drinking cup, furnished with handles.\r\nIt was the cup sacred to Bacchus, who is frequently represented on\r\nancient vases holding it in his hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cantharus. (From an ancient Vase.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTĬCUM, an interlude between the acts of a Roman comedy, and\r\nsometimes, perhaps, of a tragedy. It consisted of flute music,\r\naccompanied by a kind of recitative performed by a single actor,\r\nor if there were two, the second was not allowed to speak with the\r\nfirst. In the canticum, as violent gesticulation was required, it\r\nappears to have been the custom, from the time of Livius Andronicus,\r\nfor the actor to confine himself to the gesticulation, while another\r\nperson sang the recitative.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPILLUS. [COMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPISTRUM (φορβειά), a halter, or tie for horses, asses, or other\r\nanimals, placed round the head or neck, and made of osiers or other\r\nfibrous materials. The Greek word φορβειά was also applied to a\r\ncontrivance used by pipers and trumpeters to compress their mouths\r\nand cheeks, and thus to aid them in blowing. It is often seen in\r\nworks of ancient art, and was said to be the invention of Marsyas.\r\n[TIBIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPĬTE CENSI. [CAPUT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPĬTIS DĒMĬNŪTĬO. [CAPUT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPĬTŌLĪNI LŪDI. [LUDI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPĬTŌLĬUM. [See CLASS. DICTIONARY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPĬTŬLUM. [COLUMNA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPSA, or SCRĪNĬUM, a box for holding books among the Romans. These\r\nboxes were of a cylindrical form. There does not appear to have\r\nbeen any difference between the _capsa_ and _scrinium_, except that\r\nthe latter word was usually applied to those boxes which held a\r\nconsiderable number of rolls. The slaves who had the charge of these\r\nbook-chests were called _capsarii_, and also _custodes scriniorum_;\r\nand the slaves who carried in a capsa behind their young masters\r\nthe books, &c. of the sons of respectable Romans, when they went to\r\nschool, were called by the same name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Muse Clio with a Capsa. (Pitture d’Ercolano, vol.\r\nii. pl. 2.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPSĀRĬI, the name of three different classes of slaves. [BALNEUM;\r\nCAPSA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPUT, the head. The term “head” is often used by the Roman writers\r\nas equivalent to “person,” or “human being.” By an easy transition\r\nit was used to signify “life:” thus, _capite damnari_, _plecti_,\r\n&c., are equivalent to capital punishment. _Caput_ is also used\r\nto express a man’s _status_, or civil condition; and the persons\r\nwho were registered in the tables of the censor are spoken of as\r\n_capita_, sometimes with the addition of the word _civium_, and\r\nsometimes not. Thus to be registered in the census was the same\r\nthing as _caput habere_: and a slave and a filius familias, in this\r\nsense of the word, were said to have no _caput_. The sixth class of\r\nServius Tullius comprised the _proletarii_ and the _capite censi_,\r\nof whom the latter, having little or no property, were barely rated\r\nas so many _head_ of citizens.--He who lost or changed his status\r\nwas said to be _capite minutus_, _deminutus_, or _capitis minor_.\r\n_Capitis minutio_ or _deminutio_ was a change of a person’s status\r\nor civil condition, and consisted of three kinds.--A Roman citizen\r\npossessed freedom (_libertas_), citizenship (_civitas_), and family\r\n(_familias_): the loss of all three constituted the _maxima capitis\r\ndeminutio_. This capitis deminutio was sustained by those who refused\r\nto be registered at the census, or neglected the registration, and\r\nwere thence called _incensi_. The _incensus_ was liable to be sold,\r\nand so to lose his liberty. Those who refused to perform military\r\nservice might also be sold.--The loss of citizenship and family only,\r\nas when a man was interdicted from fire and water, was the _media\r\ncapitis deminutio_. [EXSILIUM.]--The change of family by adoption,\r\nand by the in manum conventio, was the _minima capitis deminutio_.--A\r\n_judicium capitale_, or _poena capitalis_, was one which affected a\r\ncitizen’s caput.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPUT. [FENUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂPUT EXTŌRUM. The Roman soothsayers (_haruspices_) pretended to a\r\nknowledge of coming events from the inspection of the entrails of\r\nvictims slain for that purpose. The part to which they especially\r\ndirected their attention was the liver, the convex upper portion of\r\nwhich seems to have been called the _caput extorum_. Any disease\r\nor deficiency in this organ was considered an unfavourable omen;\r\nwhereas, if healthy and perfect, it was believed to indicate good\r\nfortune. If no caput was found, it was a bad sign (_nihil tristius\r\naccidere potuit_); if well defined or double, it was a lucky omen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂRĂCALLA, an outer garment used in Gaul, and not unlike the Roman\r\n_lacerna_. It was first introduced at Rome by the emperor Aurelius\r\nAntoninus Bassianus, who compelled all the people that came to\r\ncourt to wear it, whence he obtained the surname of Caracalla. This\r\ngarment, as worn in Gaul, does not appear to have reached lower than\r\nthe knee, but Caracalla lengthened it so as to reach the ankle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARCER (_kerker_, German; γοργύρα, Greek), a prison, is connected\r\nwith ἕρκος and εἵργω, the guttural being interchanged with the\r\naspirate. (1) GREEK. Imprisonment was seldom used amongst the Greeks\r\nas a legal punishment for offences; they preferred banishment to\r\nthe expense of keeping prisoners in confinement. The prisons in\r\ndifferent countries were called by different names; thus there\r\nwas the _Ceadas_ (Κεάδας), at Sparta; and, among the Ionians, the\r\n_Gorgyra_ (γοργύρα), as at Samos. The prison at Athens was in former\r\ntimes called _Desmoterion_ (δεσμωτήριον), and afterwards, by a\r\nsort of euphemism, οἴκημα. It was chiefly used as a guard-house or\r\nplace of execution, and was under the charge of the public officers\r\ncalled the Eleven.--(2) ROMAN. A prison was first built at Rome by\r\nAncus Martius, overhanging the forum. This was enlarged by Servius\r\nTullius, who added to it a souterrain, or dungeon, called from him\r\nthe _Tullianum_. Sallust describes this as being twelve feet under\r\nground, walled on each side, and arched over with stone work. For\r\na long time this was the only prison at Rome, being, in fact, the\r\n“Tower,” or state prison of the city, which was sometimes doubly\r\nguarded in times of alarm, and was the chief object of attack in\r\nmany conspiracies. There were, however, other prisons besides this,\r\nthough, as we might expect, the words of Roman historians generally\r\nrefer to this alone. In the _Tullianum_ prisoners were generally\r\nexecuted, and this part of the prison was also called _robur_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARCĔRES. [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCARCHĒSĬUM (καρχήσιον). (1) A beaker or drinking-cup, which was used\r\nby the Greeks in very early times. It was slightly contracted in the\r\nmiddle, and its two handles extended from the top to the bottom. It\r\nwas much employed in libations of wine, milk, and honey.--(2) The\r\nupper part of the mast of a ship. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCARMENTĀLĬA, a festival celebrated in honour of Carmenta or\r\nCarmentis, who is fabled to have been the mother of Evander, who\r\ncame from Pallantium in Arcadia, and settled in Latium: he was said\r\nto have brought with him a knowledge of the arts, and the Latin\r\nalphabetical characters as distinguished from the Etruscan. This\r\nfestival was celebrated annually on the 11th of January. A temple\r\nwas erected to the same goddess, at the foot of the Capitoline\r\nhill, near the Porta Carmentalis, afterwards called Scelerata. The\r\nname Carmenta is said to have been given to her from her prophetic\r\ncharacter, carmens or carmentis being synonymous with vates. The word\r\nis, of course, connected with _carmen_, as prophecies were generally\r\ndelivered in verse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNEIA (καρνεῖα), a great national festival, celebrated by the\r\nSpartans in honour of Apollo Carneios. The festival began on the\r\nseventh day of the month of Carneios = Metageitnion of the Athenians,\r\nand lasted for nine days. It was of a warlike character, similar to\r\nthe Attic Boëdromia. During the time of its celebration nine tents\r\nwere pitched near the city, in each of which nine men lived in\r\nthe manner of a military camp, obeying in everything the commands\r\nof a herald. The priest conducting the sacrifices at the Carneia\r\nwas called _Agetes_ (Ἀγητής), whence the festival was sometimes\r\ndesignated by the name _Agetoria_ or _Agetoreion_ (Ἀγητόρια or\r\nἈγητόρειον), and from each of the Spartan tribes five men (Καρνεᾶται)\r\nwere chosen as his ministers, whose office lasted four years,\r\nduring which period they were not allowed to marry. When we read in\r\nHerodotus and Thucydides that the Spartans during the celebration of\r\nthis festival were not allowed to take the field against an enemy, we\r\nmust remember that this restriction was not peculiar to the Carneia,\r\nbut common to all the great festivals of the Greeks: traces of it are\r\nfound even in Homer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNĬFEX, the public executioner at Rome, who executed slaves and\r\nforeigners, but not citizens, who were punished in a manner different\r\nfrom slaves. It was also his business to administer the torture.\r\nThis office was considered so disgraceful, that he was not allowed\r\nto reside within the city, but lived without the Porta Metia or\r\nEsquilina, near the place destined for the punishment of slaves,\r\ncalled Sestertium under the emperors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARPENTUM, a cart; also a two-wheeled carriage, enclosed, and with\r\nan arched or sloping cover overhead. The carpentum was used to\r\nconvey the Roman matrons in the public festal processions; and this\r\nwas a high distinction, since the use of carriages in the city was\r\nentirely forbidden during the whole of the republican period. Hence\r\nthe privilege of riding in a carpentum in the public festivals was\r\nsometimes granted to females of the imperial family. This carriage\r\ncontained seats for two, and sometimes for three persons, besides\r\nthe coachman. It was commonly drawn by a pair of mules, but more\r\nrarely by oxen or horses, and sometimes by four horses like a\r\nquadriga.--Carpenta, or covered carts, were much used by the Britons,\r\nthe Gauls, and other northern nations. These, together with the\r\ncarts of the more common form, including baggage-waggons, appear to\r\nhave been comprehended under the term _carri_, or _carra_, which is\r\nthe Celtic name with a Latin termination. The Gauls took a great\r\nmultitude of them on their military expeditions, and when they were\r\nencamped, arranged them in close order, so as to form extensive lines\r\nof circumvallation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRĀGO, a kind of fortification, consisting of a great number of\r\nwaggons placed round an army. It was employed by barbarous nations,\r\nas, for instance, the Scythians, Gauls, and Goths. Carrago also\r\nsignifies sometimes the baggage of an army.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRŪCA, a carriage, the name of which only occurs under the\r\nemperors. It appears to have been a species of rheda [RHEDA], had\r\nfour wheels, and was used in travelling. These carriages were\r\nsometimes used in Rome by persons of distinction, like the carpenta;\r\nin which case they appear to have been covered with plates of bronze,\r\nsilver, and even gold, which were sometimes ornamented with embossed\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRUS. [CARPENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂRỸA or CĂRỸĀTIS (καρύα, καρυατίς), a festival celebrated at Caryae,\r\nin Laconia, in honour of Artemis Caryatis. It was celebrated every\r\nyear by Lacedaemonian maidens with national dances of a very lively\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂRỸĀTĬDES, female figures used in architecture instead of columns.\r\nTheir name is usually derived from Caryae, a city in Arcadia, near\r\nthe Laconian border, the women of which are said to have been reduced\r\nto slavery by the Greeks, because Caryae had joined the Persians at\r\nthe invasion of Greece. But this tale is probably apocryphal. One of\r\nthe porticos of the Erechtheum at Athens is supported by Caryatides.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSIS. [GALEA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTELLUM ĂQUAE. [AQUAE DUCTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRA. Roman armies never halted for a single night without forming\r\na regular entrenchment, termed _castra_, capable of receiving within\r\nits limits the whole body of fighting men, their beasts of burden,\r\nand the baggage. So completely was this recognised as a part of the\r\nordinary duties of each march, that _pervenire ad locum tertiis ...\r\nquartis ... septuagesimis castris_ are the established phrases for\r\nexpressing the number of days occupied in passing from one point to\r\nanother. Whenever circumstances rendered it expedient for a force to\r\noccupy the same ground for any length of time, then the encampment\r\nwas distinguished as _castra stativa_. In wild and barbarian lands,\r\nwhere there were no large towns and no tribes on whose faith\r\nreliance could be placed, armies, whether of invasion or occupation,\r\nwere forced to remain constantly in camps. They usually, however,\r\noccupied different ground in summer and in winter, whence arose the\r\ndistinction between _castra aestiva_ and _castra hiberna_, both alike\r\nbeing _stativa_. But whether a camp was temporary or permanent,\r\nwhether tenanted in summer or in winter, the main features of the\r\nwork were always the same for the same epoch. In hiberna, huts of\r\nturf or stone would be substituted for the open tents of the aestiva\r\n(hence _aedificare hiberna_), and in stativa held for long periods\r\nthe defences would present a more substantial and finished aspect,\r\nbut the general outline and disposition of the parts were invariable.\r\nPolybius has transmitted to us a description of a Roman camp, from\r\nwhich the annexed plan has been drawn up. It is such as would be\r\nformed at the close of an ordinary day’s march by a regular consular\r\narmy consisting of two Roman legions with the full contingent of\r\nSocii. Each legion is calculated at 4200 infantry and 300 cavalry;\r\nthe Socii furnished an equal number of infantry, and twice as many\r\ncavalry, so that the whole force would amount to 16,800 foot and\r\n1800 horse. Skill in the selection of a spot for a camp (_capere\r\nlocum castris_) was ever considered as a high quality in a general,\r\nand we find it recorded among the praises of the most renowned\r\ncommanders that they were wont in person to perform this duty. Under\r\nordinary circumstances, however, the task was devolved upon one of\r\nthe military tribunes, and a certain number of centurions appointed\r\nfrom time to time for the purpose. These having gone forward in\r\nadvance of the army until they reached the place near which it was\r\nintended to halt, and having taken a general survey of the ground,\r\nselected a spot from whence a good view of the whole proposed area\r\nmight be obtained. This spot was considerably within the limits of\r\nthe contemplated enclosure, and was marked by a small white flag. The\r\nnext object was to ascertain in what direction water and fodder might\r\nbe most easily and securely provided. These two preliminary points\r\nbeing decided, the business of measuring out the ground (_metari\r\ncastra_) commenced, and was executed, as we learn from various\r\nsources, with graduated rods (_decempedae_) by persons denominated\r\n_metatores_. In practice the most important points were marked by\r\nwhite poles, some of which bore flags of various colours, so that the\r\ndifferent battalions on reaching the ground could at once discover\r\nthe place assigned to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A, praetorium.--B, tents of the tribunes.--C, tents\r\nof the praefecti sociorum.--D, street 100 feet wide.--E, F, G, and\r\nH, streets 50 feet wide.--L, select foot and volunteers.--K, select\r\nhorse and volunteers.--M, extraordinary horse of the allies.--N,\r\nextraordinary foot of the allies.--O, reserved for occasional\r\nauxiliaries.--Q, the street called Quintana, 50 feet wide.--V P, via\r\nprincipalis, 100 feet wide.]\r\n\r\nThe white flag A, which served as the starting point of the\r\nwhole construction, marked the position of the consul’s tent, or\r\n_praetorium_, so called because _praetor_ was the ancient term for\r\nany one invested with supreme command. A square area was left open,\r\nextending a hundred feet each way from the praetorium. The camp was\r\ndivided into two parts, the upper and the lower. The upper part\r\nformed about a third of the whole. In it was the _praetorium_ (A) or\r\ngeneral’s tent. A part of the praetorium was called the _Augurale_,\r\nas the auguries were there taken by the general. On the right and\r\nleft of the praetorium were the _forum_ and _quaestorium_; the former\r\na sort of market-place, the latter appropriated to the quaestor and\r\nthe camp stores under his superintendence. On the sides of and facing\r\nthe forum and quaestorium, were stationed select bodies of horse\r\n(K) taken from the extraordinaries, with mounted volunteers, who\r\nserved out of respect to the consul, and were stationed near him. And\r\nparallel to these were posted similar bodies of foot-soldiers (L).\r\nBefore the quaestorium and the forum were the tents of the twelve\r\ntribunes of the two legions (B), and before the select bodies of\r\nhorse and infantry the tents of the praefecti sociorum were probably\r\nplaced (C). Again, behind the praetorium, the quaestorium, and the\r\nforum, ran a street or _via_ (D), 100 feet broad, from one side of\r\nthe camp to the other. Along the upper side of this street was ranged\r\nthe main body of the “extraordinary” horse (M): they were separated\r\ninto two equal parts by a street fifty feet broad (E). At the back\r\nof this body of cavalry was posted a similar body of infantry (N),\r\nselected from the allies, and facing the opposite way, _i.e._ towards\r\nthe ramparts of the camp. The vacant spaces (O) on each side of these\r\ntroops were reserved for foreigners and occasional auxiliaries.\r\nThe lower part of the camp was divided from the upper by a street,\r\ncalled the _Via Principalis_ (V P), or _Principia_, a hundred feet\r\nbroad. Here the tribunal of the general was erected, from which he\r\nharangued the soldiers, and here the tribunes administered justice.\r\nHere also the principal standards, the altars of the gods, and the\r\nimages of the emperors were placed. The lower part of the camp was\r\noccupied by the two legions and the troops of the allies according\r\nto the arrangement of the preceding cut. Between the ramparts and\r\nthe tents was left a vacant space of 200 feet on every side, which\r\nwas useful for many purposes: thus it served for the reception of\r\nany booty that was taken, and facilitated the entrance and exit of\r\nthe army. The camp had four gates, one at the top and bottom, and\r\none at each of the sides; the top or back-gate, which was the side\r\nmost away from the enemy, was called the _decumana_. The bottom or\r\nthe front gate was the _practoria_, the gates of the sides were the\r\n_porta principalis dextra_, and the _porta principalis sinistra_. The\r\nwhole camp was surrounded by a trench (_fossa_), generally nine feet\r\ndeep and twelve broad, and a rampart (_vallum_) made of the earth\r\nthat was thrown up (_agger_), with stakes (_valli_) fixed at the\r\ntop of it. The labour of this work was so divided, that the allies\r\ncompleted the two sides of the camp alongside of which they were\r\nstationed, and the two Roman legions the rest.--In describing the\r\nRoman camp and its internal arrangements, we have confined ourselves\r\nto the information given by Polybius, which, of course, applies only\r\nto his age, and to armies constituted like those he witnessed. When\r\nthe practice of drawing up the army according to cohorts, ascribed\r\nto Marius or Caesar [EXERCITUS], had superseded the ancient division\r\ninto maniples, and the distinction of triarii, &c., the internal\r\narrangements of the camp must have been changed accordingly. In\r\neach legion the tribunes divided themselves into three sections of\r\ntwo each, and each section in turn undertook for two months the\r\nsuperintendence of all matters connected with the camp. Out of the\r\ntwenty maniples of Principes and Triarii in each legion, two were\r\nappointed to take charge of the broad passage or street called\r\n_Principia_, extending right across the camp in front of the tents\r\nof the tribunes. Of the remaining eighteen maniples of Principes and\r\nHastati in each legion, three were assigned by lot to each of the six\r\ntribunes, and of these three maniples one in turn rendered each day\r\ncertain services to the tribune to whom it was specially attached.\r\nOne maniple was selected each day from the whole legionary force,\r\nto keep guard beside the tent of the general. Three sentinels were\r\nusually posted at the tents of the quaestor, and of the legati: and\r\nby night sentinels kept watch at every maniple, being chosen out of\r\nthe maniple which they guarded. The Velites mounted guard by day\r\nand by night along the whole extent of the vallum: to them also in\r\nbodies of ten was committed the charge of the gates, while strong\r\nbodies of infantry and cavalry were thrown forward in advance of\r\neach gate, to resist any sudden onset, and give timely notice of the\r\napproach of the enemy.--_Excubiae_; _excubias agere_; _excubare_;\r\nare the general terms used with reference to mounting guard whether\r\nby night or by day. _Vigiliae_; _vigilias agere_; _vigilare_; are\r\nrestricted to night duty: _Excubiae_ and _Vigiliae_ frequently\r\ndenote not only the service itself, but also the individuals who\r\nperformed it. _Stationes_ is used specially to denote the advanced\r\nposts thrown forward in front of the gates. _Custodes_ or _Custodiae_\r\nthe parties who watched the gates themselves, _Praesidia_ the\r\nsentinels on the ramparts, but all these words are employed in many\r\nother significations also. The duty of going the rounds (_Vigilias\r\ncircuire s. circumire_) was committed to the Equites, and for this\r\npurpose each legion supplied daily four, picked out from each turma\r\nin rotation by the commander of the troop. The eight persons thus\r\nselected decided by lot in which watch they should make their rounds,\r\ntwo being assigned to each watch. They then repaired to the tribune,\r\nand each individual received a written order specifying the posts\r\nwhich he was to visit, every post being visited in each watch by one\r\nor other of the two to whom the watch belonged. Sometimes we find\r\ncenturions, tribunes, and even the general in chief represented as\r\ngoing the rounds, but, under ordinary circumstances, the duty was\r\nperformed as we have described. The watchword for the night was not\r\ncommunicated verbally, but by means of a small rectangular tablet\r\nof wood (πλατεῖον ἐπιγεγραμμένον--_tessera_) upon which it was\r\nwritten.--_Breaking up a Camp._ On the first signal being given by\r\nthe trumpet, the tents were all struck and the baggage packed, the\r\ntents of the general and the tribunes being disposed of before the\r\nothers were touched. At the second signal the baggage was placed upon\r\nthe beasts of burden; at the third, the whole army began to move.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTĂLŎGUS (κατάλογος), the catalogue of those persons in Athens who\r\nwere liable to regular military service. At Athens, those persons\r\nalone who possessed a certain amount of property were allowed to\r\nserve in the regular infantry, whilst the lowest class, the thetes,\r\nhad not this privilege. [CENSUS.] Thus the former are called οἱ ἐκ\r\nκαταλόγου στρατεύοντες, and the latter οἱ ἔξω τοῦ καταλόγου.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTĂPHRACTA. [LORICA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTĂPHRACTI (κατάφρακτοι). (1) Heavy-armed cavalry, the horses\r\nof which were also covered with defensive armour. Among many of\r\nthe Eastern nations, who placed their chief dependence upon their\r\ncavalry, we find horses protected in this manner; but among the\r\nRomans we do not read of any troops of this description till the\r\nlater times of the empire, when the discipline of the legions was\r\ndestroyed, and the chief dependence began to be placed on the\r\ncavalry. This species of troops was common among the Persians from\r\nthe earliest times, from whom it was adopted by their Macedonian\r\nconquerors. They were called by the Persians _clibanarii_.--(2)\r\nDecked vessels, in opposition to _Aphracti_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTĂPĪRĀTĒR (καταπειρατηρία, βολίς), the lead used in sounding (ἐν τῷ\r\nβολίζειν), or fathoming the depth of water in navigation. The mode of\r\nemploying this instrument appears to have been precisely the same as\r\nthat now in use.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTĂPULTA. [TORMENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTĂRACTA (καταῤῥάκτης), a portcullis, so called because it fell with\r\ngreat force and a loud noise. It was an additional defence, suspended\r\nby iron rings and ropes, before the gates of a city, in such a manner\r\nthat, when the enemy had come up to the gates, the portcullis might\r\nbe let down so as to shut them in, and to enable the besieged to\r\nassail them from above.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTEIA, a missile used in war by the Germans, Gauls, and some of the\r\nItalian nations, supposed to resemble the ACLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTĒNA, dim. CĂTELLA (ἄλυσις, dim. ἀλύσιον, ἀλυσίδιον), a chain.\r\nThe chains which were of superior value, either on account of the\r\nmaterial or the workmanship, are commonly called _catellae_ (ἀλύσια),\r\nthe diminutive expressing their fineness and delicacy as well as\r\ntheir minuteness. The specimens of ancient chains which we have in\r\nbronze lamps, in scales, and in ornaments for the person, especially\r\nnecklaces, show a great variety of elegant and ingenious patterns.\r\nBesides a plain circle or oval, the separate link is often shaped\r\nlike the figure 8, or is a bar with a circle at each end, or assumes\r\nother forms, some of which are here shown. The links are also found\r\nso closely entwined, that the chain resembles platted wire or thread,\r\nlike the gold chains now manufactured at Venice. This is represented\r\nin the lowest figure of the woodcut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Chains.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTERVĀRĬI. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cathedra. (From a Painting on a Vase.)]\r\n\r\nCĂTHEDRA, a seat or chair, was more particularly applied to a soft\r\nseat used by women, whereas _sella_ signified a seat common to both\r\nsexes. The cathedrae were, no doubt, of various forms and sizes; but\r\nthey usually appear to have had backs to them. On the cathedra in the\r\nannexed cut is seated a bride, who is being fanned by a female slave\r\nwith a fan made of peacock’s feathers. Women were also accustomed to\r\nbe carried abroad in these cathedrae instead of in lecticae, which\r\npractice was sometimes adopted by effeminate persons of the other\r\nsex. The word cathedra was also applied to the chair or pulpit from\r\nwhich lectures were read.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂTĪNUS, or CĂTĪNUM, a large dish, on which fish and meat were served\r\nup at table. Hence Horace speaks of an _angustus catinus_ as an\r\nindication of niggardliness on the part of the host.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂVAEDĬUM. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĂVĔA. [THEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUPŌNA. (1) An inn, where travellers obtained food and lodging; in\r\nwhich sense it answered to the Greek words πανδοκεῖον, καταγώγιον,\r\nand κατάλυσις. Inns for the accommodation of persons of all classes\r\nexisted among the Greeks and Romans, although they were not equal\r\neither in size or convenience to similar places in modern times.\r\nAn inn was also called _taberna_ and _taberna diversoria_, or\r\nsimply _diversorium_ or _deversorium_.--(2) A shop, where wine\r\nand ready-dressed meat were sold, thus corresponding to the Greek\r\nκαπηλεῖον. The person who kept a caupona was called _caupo_. In\r\nGreek κάπηλος signifies in general a retail trader, who sold goods\r\nin small quantities; but the word is more particularly applied to\r\na person who sold ready-dressed provisions, and especially wine in\r\nsmall quantities. In these καπηλεῖα only persons of the very lowest\r\nclass were accustomed to eat and drink. In Rome itself there were, no\r\ndoubt, inns to accommodate strangers; but these were probably only\r\nfrequented by the lower classes, since all persons in respectable\r\nsociety could easily find accommodation in the houses of their\r\nfriends. There were, however, in all parts of the city, numerous\r\nhouses where wine and ready-dressed provisions were sold. The houses\r\nwhere persons were allowed to eat and drink were usually called\r\n_popinae_ and not _cauponae_; and the keepers of them, _popae_. They\r\nwere principally frequented by slaves and the lower classes, and\r\nwere consequently only furnished with stools to sit upon instead of\r\ncouches. The _Thermopolia_, where the _calida_ or warm wine and water\r\nwas sold, appear to have been the same as the _popinae_. Many of\r\nthese popinae were little better than the _lupanaria_ or brothels;\r\nwhence Horace calls them _immundas popinas_. The _ganeae_, which are\r\nsometimes mentioned in connection with the _popinae_, were brothels,\r\nwhence they are often classed with the _lustra_. Under the emperors\r\nmany attempts were made to regulate the popinae, but apparently\r\nwith little success. All persons who kept inns or houses of public\r\nentertainment of any kind were held in low estimation both among\r\nthe Greeks and Romans. They appear to have fully deserved the bad\r\nreputation which they possessed, for they were accustomed to cheat\r\ntheir customers by false weights and measures, and by all the means\r\nin their power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSĬA (καυσία), a hat with a broad brim, which was made of felt, and\r\nworn by the Macedonian kings. Its form is seen in the annexed figure.\r\nThe Romans adopted it from the Macedonians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Causia, Hat. (From a Painting on a Vase.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUTĬO, CĂVĒRE. These words are of frequent occurrence, and have a\r\ngreat variety of significations, according to the matter to which\r\nthey refer. Their general signification is that of security given by\r\none person to another, or security which one person obtains by the\r\nadvice or assistance of another. The _cautio_ was most frequently a\r\nwriting, which expressed the object of the parties to it; accordingly\r\nthe word cautio came to signify both the instrument (_chirographum_\r\nor _instrumentum_) and the object which it was the purpose of the\r\ninstrument to secure. Cicero uses the expression _cautio chirographi\r\nmei_. The phrase _cavere aliquid alicui_ expressed the fact of one\r\nperson giving security to another as to some particular thing or act.\r\nThe word _cautio_ was also applied to the release which a debtor\r\nobtained from his creditor on satisfying his demand; in this sense\r\ncautio is equivalent to a modern receipt; it is the debtor’s security\r\nagainst the same demand being made a second time. Thus _cavere ab\r\naliquo_ signifies to obtain this kind of security. _Cavere_ is also\r\napplied to express the professional advice and assistance of a lawyer\r\nto his client for his conduct in any legal matter. _Cavere_ and its\r\nderivatives are also used to express the provisions of a law, by\r\nwhich any thing is forbidden or ordered, as in the phrase, _Cautum\r\nest lege_, &c. It is also used to express the words in a will, by\r\nwhich a testator declares his wish that certain things should be done\r\nafter his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĔADAS or CAEADAS (κεάδας or καιάδας), a deep cavern or chasm, like\r\nthe Barathron at Athens, into which the Spartans were accustomed to\r\nthrust persons condemned to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĔLĔRES, are said by Livy to have been three hundred horsemen,\r\nwho formed the body-guard of Romulus both in peace and war. There\r\ncan, however, be little doubt that these Celeres were not simply\r\nthe body-guard of the king, but were the same as the equites,\r\nor horsemen, a fact which is expressly stated by some writers.\r\n[EQUITES.] The etymology of Celeres is variously given. Some writers\r\nderived it from their leader Celer, who was said to have slain Remus,\r\nbut most writers connected it with the Greek κέλης, in reference to\r\nthe quickness of their service. The Celeres were under the command\r\nof a _Tribunus Celerum_, who stood in the same relation to the king\r\nas the magister equitum did in a subsequent period to the dictator.\r\nHe occupied the second place in the state, and in the absence of the\r\nking had the right of convoking the comitia. Whether he was appointed\r\nby the king, or elected by the comitia, has been questioned, but the\r\nformer is the more probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELLA, in its primary sense, means a store-room of any kind. Of these\r\nthere were various descriptions, which took their distinguishing\r\ndenominations from the articles they contained, as, for instance,\r\nthe _cella penuaria_ or _penaria_, the _cella olearia_ and _cella\r\nvinaria_. The slave to whom the charge of these stores was intrusted,\r\nwas called _cellarius_, or _promus_, or _condus_, “quia _promit_ quod\r\n_conditum est_,” and sometimes _promus condus_ and _procurator peni_.\r\nThis answers to our butler and housekeeper. Any number of small rooms\r\nclustered together like the cells of a honeycomb were also termed\r\n_cellae_; hence the dormitories of slaves and menials are called\r\n_cellae_, and _cellae familiaricae_, in distinction to a bed-chamber,\r\nwhich was _cubiculum_. Thus a sleeping-room at a public-house is\r\nalso termed _cella_. _Cella ostiarii_, or _janitoris_, is the\r\nporter’s lodge. In the baths the _cella caldaria_, _tepidaria_, and\r\n_frigidaria_, were those which contained respectively the warm,\r\ntepid, and cold bath. [BALNEAE.] The interior of a temple, that is\r\nthe part included within the outside shell (σηκός), was also called\r\n_cella_. There was sometimes more than one _cella_ within the same\r\nperistyle or under the same roof, in which case each cell took\r\nthe name of the deity whose statue it contained, as _cella_ Jovis,\r\n_cella_ Junonis, _cella_ Minervae, as in the temple of Jupiter on the\r\nCapitoline.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĔNOTĂPHĬUM, a cenotaph (κενός and τάφος), was an empty or honorary\r\ntomb, erected as a memorial of a person whose body was buried\r\nelsewhere, or not found for burial at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENSOR (τιμητής), the name of two magistrates of high rank in the\r\nRoman republic. Their office was called _Censura_ (τιμητεία or\r\nτιμητία). The _Census_, which was a register of Roman citizens and\r\nof their property, was first established by Servius Tullius, the\r\nfifth king of Rome. After the expulsion of the kings it was taken\r\nby the consuls; and special magistrates were not appointed for the\r\npurpose of taking it till the year B.C. 443. The reason of this\r\nalteration was owing to the appointment in the preceding year of\r\ntribuni militum with consular power in place of the consuls; and\r\nas these tribunes might be plebeians, the patricians deprived the\r\nconsuls, and consequently their representatives, the tribunes, of\r\nthe right of taking the census, and entrusted it to two magistrates,\r\ncalled _Censores_, who were to be chosen exclusively from the\r\npatricians. The magistracy continued to be a patrician one till B.C.\r\n351, when C. Marcius Rutilus was the first plebeian censor. Twelve\r\nyears afterwards, B.C. 339, it was provided by one of the Publilian\r\nlaws, that one of the censors must necessarily be a plebeian, but it\r\nwas not till B.C. 280 that a plebeian censor performed the solemn\r\npurification of the people (_lustrum condidit_). In B.C. 131 the two\r\ncensors were for the first time plebeians.--The censors were elected\r\nin the comitia centuriata held under the presidency of a consul. As\r\na general principle, the only persons eligible to the office were\r\nthose who had previously been consuls; but a few exceptions occur.\r\nAt first there was no law to prevent a person being censor a second\r\ntime; but the only person, who was twice elected to the office, was\r\nC. Marcius Rutilus in B.C. 265; and he brought forward a law in this\r\nyear, enacting that no one should be chosen censor a second time, and\r\nreceived in consequence the surname of Censorinus.--The censorship\r\nis distinguished from all other Roman magistracies by the length of\r\ntime during which it was held. The censors were originally chosen\r\nfor a whole lustrum, that is, a period of five years; but their\r\noffice was limited to eighteen months, as early as ten years after\r\nits institution (B.C. 433), by a law of the dictator Mam. Aemilius\r\nMamercinus. The censors also held a very peculiar position with\r\nrespect to rank and dignity. No imperium was bestowed upon them,\r\nand accordingly they had no lictors. The _jus censurae_ was granted\r\nto them by a _lex centuriata_, and not by the curiae, and in that\r\nrespect they were inferior in power to the consuls and praetors. But\r\nnotwithstanding this, the censorship was regarded as the highest\r\ndignity in the state, with the exception of the dictatorship; it was\r\na _sanctus magistratus_, to which the deepest reverence was due.\r\nThey possessed of course the sella curulis. The funeral of a censor\r\nwas always conducted with great pomp and splendour, and hence a\r\n_funus censorium_ was voted even to the emperors.--The censorship\r\ncontinued in existence for 421 years, namely, from B.C. 443 to\r\nB.C. 22; but during this period many lustra passed by without any\r\ncensor being chosen at all. Its power was limited by one of the\r\nlaws of the tribune Clodius (B.C. 58). After the year B.C. 22 the\r\nemperors discharged the duties of the censorship under the name of\r\n_Praefectura Morum_.--The duties of the censors may be divided into\r\nthree classes, all of which were however closely connected with\r\none another: I. _The Census_, or register of the citizens and of\r\ntheir property, in which were included the _lectio senatus_, and\r\nthe _recognitio equitum_; II. _The Regimen Morum_; and III. _The\r\nadministration of the finances of the state_, under which were\r\nclassed the superintendence of the public buildings and the erection\r\nof all new public works.--I. The CENSUS, the first and principal\r\nduty of the censors, for which the proper expression is _censum\r\nagere_, was always held in the Campus Martius, and from the year\r\nB.C. 435 in a special building called _Villa Publica_. After the\r\nauspicia had been taken, the citizens were summoned by a public crier\r\n(_praeco_) to appear before the censors. Each tribe was called up\r\nseparately, and every paterfamilias had to appear in person before\r\nthe censors, who were seated in their curule chairs. The census was\r\nconducted _ad arbitrium censoris_; but the censors laid down certain\r\nrules, sometimes called _leges censui censendo_, in which mention\r\nwas made of the different kinds of property subject to the census,\r\nand in what way their value was to be estimated. According to these\r\nlaws each citizen had to give an account of himself, of his family,\r\nand of his property upon oath, _ex animi sententia_. First he had\r\nto give his full name (_praenomen_, _nomen_, and _cognomen_) and\r\nthat of his father, or if he were a freedman that of his patron,\r\nand he was likewise obliged to state his age. He was then asked,\r\n_Tu, ex animi tui sententia, uxorem habes?_ and if married he had\r\nto give the name of his wife, and likewise the number, names, and\r\nages of his children, if any. Single women (_viduae_) and orphans\r\n(_orbi orbaeque_) were represented by their tutores; their names\r\nwere entered in separate lists, and they were not included in the\r\nsum total of capita. After a citizen had stated his name, age,\r\nfamily, &c., he then had to give an account of all his property,\r\nso far as it was subject to the census. In making this statement\r\nhe was said _censere_ or _censeri_, as a deponent, “to value or\r\nestimate himself,” or as a passive “to be valued or estimated:”\r\nthe censor, who received the statement, was also said _censere_,\r\nas well as _accipere censum_. Only such things were liable to the\r\ncensus (_censui censendo_) as were property _ex jure Quiritium_. Land\r\nformed the most important article in the census; next came slaves and\r\ncattle. The censors also possessed the right of calling for a return\r\nof such objects as had not usually been given in, such as clothing,\r\njewels, and carriages. We can hardly doubt that the censors possessed\r\nthe power of setting a higher valuation on the property than the\r\ncitizens themselves had put. The tax (_tributum_) was usually one\r\nper thousand upon the property entered in the books of the censors;\r\nbut on one occasion the censors, as a punishment, compelled a person\r\nto pay eight per thousand (_octuplicato censu_, Liv. iv. 24). A\r\nperson who voluntarily absented himself from the census, and thus\r\nbecame _incensus_, was subject to the severest punishment. It is\r\nprobable that service in the army was a valid excuse for absence.\r\nAfter the censors had received the names of all the citizens with the\r\namount of their property, they then had to make out the lists of the\r\ntribes, and also of the classes and centuries; for by the legislation\r\nof Servius Tullius the position of each citizen in the state was\r\ndetermined by the amount of his property. [COMITIA CENTURIATA.]\r\nThese lists formed a most important part of the _Tabulae Censoriae_,\r\nunder which name were included all the documents connected in any\r\nway with the discharge of the censors’ duties. These lists, as far\r\nat least as they were connected with the finances of the state,\r\nwere deposited in the aerarium, which was the temple of Saturn; but\r\nthe regular depository for all the archives of the censors was in\r\nearlier times the Atrium Libertatis, near the Villa publica, and\r\nin later times the temple of the Nymphs. The censors had also to\r\nmake out the lists of the senators for the ensuing lustrum, or till\r\nnew censors were appointed; striking out the names of such as they\r\nconsidered unworthy, and making additions to the body from those who\r\nwere qualified. [SENATUS.] In the same manner they held a review of\r\nthe equites equo publico, and added and removed names as they judged\r\nproper. [EQUITES.] After the lists had been completed, the number of\r\ncitizens was counted up, and the sum total announced; and accordingly\r\nwe find that, in the account of a census, the number of citizens is\r\nlikewise usually given. They are in such cases spoken of as _capita_,\r\nsometimes with the addition of the word _civium_, and sometimes not;\r\nand hence to be registered in the census was the same thing as _caput\r\nhabere_. [CAPUT.]--II. REGIMEN MORUM. This was the most important\r\nbranch of the censors’ duties, and the one which caused their office\r\nto be the most revered and the most dreaded in the Roman state. It\r\nnaturally grew out of the right which they possessed of excluding\r\nunworthy persons from the lists of citizens. They were constituted\r\nthe conservators of public and private virtue and morality; they\r\nwere not simply to prevent crime or particular acts of immorality,\r\nbut their great object was to maintain the old Roman character and\r\nhabits, the _mos majorum_. The proper expression for this branch of\r\ntheir power was _regimen morum_, which was called in the times of\r\nthe empire _cura_ or _praefectura morum_. The punishment inflicted\r\nby the censors in the exercise of this branch of their duties was\r\ncalled _Nota_ or _Notatio_, or _Animadversio Censoria_. In inflicting\r\nit they were guided only by their conscientious convictions of\r\nduty; they had to take an oath that they would act neither through\r\npartiality nor favour; and in addition to this, they were bound in\r\nevery case to state in their lists, opposite the name of the guilty\r\ncitizen, the cause of the punishment inflicted on him,--_Subscriptio\r\ncensoria_. The consequence of such a nota was only _ignominia_ and\r\nnot infamia [INFAMIA], and the censorial verdict was not a _judicium_\r\nor res _judicata_, for its effects were not lasting, but might be\r\nremoved by the following censors, or by a lex. A nota censoria was\r\nmoreover not valid, unless both censors agreed. The ignominia was\r\nthus only a transitory capitis deminutio, which does not appear even\r\nto have deprived a magistrate of his office, and certainly did not\r\ndisqualify persons labouring under it for obtaining a magistracy,\r\nfor being appointed as judices by the praetor, or for serving in the\r\nRoman armies. This superintendence of the conduct of Roman citizens\r\nextended so far, that it embraced the whole of the public and private\r\nlife of the citizens. Thus we have instances of their censuring\r\nor punishing persons for not marrying, for breaking a promise of\r\nmarriage, for divorce, for bad conduct during marriage, for improper\r\neducation of children, for living in an extravagant and luxurious\r\nmanner, and for many other irregularities in private life. Their\r\ninfluence was still more powerful in matters connected with the\r\npublic life of the citizens. Thus we find them censuring or punishing\r\nmagistrates who were forgetful of the dignity of their office or\r\nguilty of bribery, as well as persons who were guilty of improper\r\nconduct towards magistrates, of perjury, and of neglect of their\r\nduties both in civil and military life. The punishments inflicted\r\nby the censors are generally divided into four classes:--1. _Motio_\r\nor _ejectio e senatu_, or the exclusion of a man from the number of\r\nsenators. This punishment might either be a simple exclusion from the\r\nlist of senators, or the person might at the same time be excluded\r\nfrom the tribes and degraded to the rank of an aerarian. The censors\r\nin their new lists omitted the names of such senators as they wished\r\nto exclude, and in reading these new lists in public, passed over\r\nthe names of those who were no longer to be senators. Hence the\r\nexpression _praeteriti senatores_ is equivalent to _e senatu ejecti_.\r\n2. The _ademptio equi_, or the taking away the equus publicus from\r\nan eques. This punishment might likewise be simple, or combined\r\nwith the exclusion from the tribes and the degradation to the rank\r\nof an aerarian. [EQUITES.] 3. The _motio e tribu_, or the exclusion\r\nof a person from his tribe. If the further degradation to the rank\r\nof an aerarian was combined with the motio e tribu, it was always\r\nexpressly stated. 4. The fourth punishment was called _referre in\r\naerarios_ or _facere aliquem aerarium_, and might be inflicted on any\r\nperson who was thought by the censors to deserve it. [AERARII.]--III.\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FINANCES OF THE STATE, was another part\r\nof the censors’ office. In the first place the _tributum_, or\r\nproperty-tax, had to be paid by each citizen according to the amount\r\nof his property registered in the census, and, accordingly, the\r\nregulation of this tax naturally fell under the jurisdiction of the\r\ncensors. [TRIBUTUM.] They also had the superintendence of all the\r\nother revenues of the state, the _vectigalia_, such as the tithes\r\npaid for the public lands, the salt-works, the mines, the customs,\r\n&c. [VECTIGALIA.] All these branches of the revenue the censors\r\nwere accustomed to let out to the highest bidder for the space of a\r\nlustrum or five years. The act of letting was called _venditio_ or\r\n_locatio_, and seems to have taken place in the month of March. The\r\ncensors also possessed the right, though probably not without the\r\nconcurrence of the senate, of imposing new vectigalia, and even of\r\nselling the land belonging to the state. The censors, however, did\r\nnot receive the revenues of the state. All the public money was paid\r\ninto the aerarium, which was entirely under the jurisdiction of the\r\nsenate; and all disbursements were made by order of this body, which\r\nemployed the quaestors as its officers. [AERARIUM; SENATUS.]--In one\r\nimportant department the censors were entrusted with the expenditure\r\nof the public money; though the actual payments were no doubt made\r\nby the quaestors. The censors had the general superintendence of\r\nall the public buildings and works (_opera publica_); and to meet\r\nthe expenses connected with this part of their duties, the senate\r\nvoted them a certain sum of money or certain revenues, to which\r\nthey were restricted, but which they might at the same time employ\r\naccording to their discretion. They had to see that the temples and\r\nall other public buildings were in a good state of repair (_aedes\r\nsacras tueri_ and _sarta tecta exigere_), that no public places\r\nwere encroached upon by the occupation of private persons (_loca\r\ntueri_), and that the aquaeducts, roads, drains, &c. were properly\r\nattended to. The repairs of the public works and the keeping of them\r\nin proper condition were let out by the censors by public auction to\r\nthe lowest bidder. The persons who undertook the contract were called\r\n_conductores_, _mancipes_, _redemptores_, _susceptores_, &c.; and the\r\nduties they had to discharge were specified in the _Leges Censoriae_.\r\nThe censors had also to superintend the expenses connected with the\r\nworship of the gods. In these respects it is not easy to define\r\nwith accuracy the respective duties of the censors and aediles:\r\nbut it may be remarked in general that the superintendence of the\r\naediles had more of a police character, while that of the censors had\r\nreference to all financial matters.--After the censors had performed\r\ntheir various duties and taken the census, the _lustrum_ or solemn\r\npurification of the people followed. When the censors entered upon\r\ntheir office, they drew lots to see which of them should perform this\r\npurification (_lustrum facere_ or _condere_), but both censors were\r\nobliged of course to be present at the ceremony. [LUSTRUM.]--In the\r\nRoman and Latin colonies and in the municipia there were censors,\r\nwho likewise bore the name of _quinquennales_. They are spoken of\r\nunder COLONIA. A census was sometimes taken in the provinces, even\r\nunder the republic; but there seems to have been no general census\r\ntaken in the provinces till the time of Augustus. At Rome the census\r\nstill continued to be taken under the empire, but the old ceremonies\r\nconnected with it were no longer continued, and the ceremony of the\r\nlustration was not performed after the time of Vespasian.--The word\r\n_census_, besides the meaning of “valuation” of a person’s estate,\r\nhas other significations, which must be briefly mentioned: 1. It\r\nsignified the amount of a person’s property, and hence we read of\r\n_census senatorius_, the estate of a senator; _census equestris_, the\r\nestate of an eques. 2. The lists of the censors. 3. The tax which\r\ndepended upon the valuation in the census.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENSUS.--(1) GREEK.--The Greek term for a man’s property as\r\nascertained by the census, as well as for the act of ascertaining\r\nit, is τίμημα. The only Greek state concerning whose arrangement\r\nof the census we have any satisfactory information, is Athens.\r\nPrevious to the time of Solon no census had been instituted at\r\nAthens. According to his census, all citizens were divided into four\r\nclasses: 1. _Pentacosiomedimni_ (Πεντακοσιομέδιμνοι), or persons\r\npossessing landed property which yielded an annual income of at least\r\n500 medimni of dry or liquid produce. 2. _Hippeis_ (Ἱππεῖς), i.e.\r\nknights or persons able to keep a war-horse, were those whose lands\r\nyielded an annual produce of at least 300 medimni, whence they are\r\nalso called τριακοσιομέδιμνοι. 3. _Zeugitae_ (Ζευγῖται), i.e. persons\r\nable to keep a yoke of oxen (ζεῦγος), were those whose annual income\r\nconsisted of at least 150 medimni. 4. The _Thetes_ (Θῆτες) contained\r\nall the rest of the free population, whose income was below that of\r\nthe Zeugitae. The constitution of Athens, so long as it was based\r\nupon these classes, was a timocracy (τιμοκρατία, or ἀπὸ τιμημάτων\r\nπολιτεία). The highest magistracy at Athens, or the archonship,\r\nwas at first accessible only to persons of the first class,\r\nuntil Aristides threw all the state offices open to all classes\r\nindiscriminately. The maintenance of the republic mainly devolved\r\nupon the first three classes, the last being exempted from all taxes.\r\nAs the land in the legislation of Solon was regarded as the capital\r\nwhich yielded an annual income, he regulated his system of taxation\r\nby the value of the land, which was treated as the taxable capital.\r\nLists of this taxable property (ἀπογραφαί) were kept at first by\r\nthe naucrari, who also had to conduct the census, and afterwards\r\nby the demarchi.--As property is a fluctuating thing, the census\r\nwas repeated from time to time, but the periods differed in the\r\nvarious parts of Greece, for in some a census was held every year,\r\nand in others every two or four years. At Athens every person had to\r\nstate the amount of his property, and if there was any doubt about\r\nhis honesty, it seems that a counter-valuation (ἀντιτίμησις) might\r\nbe made. This system of taxation according to classes, and based\r\nupon the possession of productive estates, underwent a considerable\r\nchange in the time of the Peloponnesian war, though the divisions\r\ninto classes themselves continued to be observed for a considerable\r\ntime after. As the wants of the republic increased, and as many\r\ncitizens were possessed of large property, without being landed\r\nproprietors, the original land-tax was changed into a property-tax.\r\nThis property-tax was called εἰσφορά, concerning which see EISPHORA.\r\nCompare LEITURGIAE; and for the taxes paid by resident aliens,\r\nMETOICI.--(2) ROMAN. [CENSOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTESĬMA, namely _pars_, or the hundredth part, also called\r\n_vectigal rerum venalium_, or _centesima rerum venalium_, was a tax\r\nof one per cent. levied at Rome and in Italy upon all goods that were\r\nexposed for public sale at auctions. It was collected by persons\r\ncalled _coactores_. This tax was perhaps introduced after the civil\r\nwar between Marius and Sulla. Its produce was assigned by Augustus\r\nto the _aerarium militare_. Tiberius reduced the tax to one half\r\nper cent. (_ducentesima_), after he had changed Cappadocia into\r\na province, and had thereby increased the revenue of the empire.\r\nCaligula in the beginning of his reign abolished the tax altogether\r\nfor Italy.\r\n\r\nCENTUMVĬRI, were judices, who resembled other judices in this\r\nrespect, that they decided cases under the authority of a\r\nmagistratus; but they differed from other judices in being a definite\r\nbody or collegium. This collegium seems to have been divided into\r\nfour parts, each of which sometimes sat by itself. The origin of\r\nthe court is unknown. According to an ancient writer, three were\r\nchosen out of each tribe, and consequently the whole number out of\r\nthe 35 tribes would be 105, who, in round numbers, were called the\r\nhundred men. If the centumviri were chosen from the tribes, this\r\nseems a strong presumption in favour of the high antiquity of the\r\ncourt. It was the practice to set up a spear in the place where\r\nthe centumviri were sitting, and accordingly the word _hasta_, or\r\n_hasta centumviralis_, is sometimes used as equivalent to the words\r\n_judicium centumvirale_. The praetor presided in this court. The\r\njurisdiction of the centumviri was chiefly confined to civil matters,\r\nbut it appears that crimina sometimes came under their cognizance.\r\nThe younger Pliny, who practised in this court, makes frequent\r\nallusions to it in his letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTŬRĬA. [EXERCITUS; COMITIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTŬRĬĀTA CŎMĪTĬA. [COMITIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTŬRĬO. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTUSSIS. [As.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĒRA (κηρός), wax. For its employment in painting, see PICTURA;\r\nand for its application as a writing material, see TABULAE and\r\nTESTAMENTUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĔRĔĀLĬA, a festival celebrated at Rome in honour of Ceres, whose\r\nwanderings in search of her lost daughter Proserpine were represented\r\nby women, clothed in white, running about with lighted torches.\r\nDuring its continuance, games were celebrated in the Circus Maximus,\r\nthe spectators of which appeared in white; but on any occasion of\r\npublic mourning the games and festivals were not celebrated at all,\r\nas the matrons could not appear at them except in white. The day\r\nof the Cerealia is doubtful; some think it was the ides or 13th of\r\nApril, others the 7th of the same month.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĔRĔVĪSĬA, CERVĪSĬA (ζύθος), ale or beer, was almost or altogether\r\nunknown to the Greeks and Romans; but it was used very generally by\r\nthe surrounding nations, whose soil and climate were less favourable\r\nto the growth of vines. According to Herodotus, the Egyptians\r\ncommonly drank “barley wine;” and Diodorus Siculus says that the\r\nEgyptian beer was nearly equal to wine in strength and flavour. The\r\nIberians and Thracians, and the people in the north of Asia Minor,\r\ninstead of drinking their beer out of cups, placed it before them in\r\na large bowl or vase, which was sometimes of gold or silver. This\r\nbeing full to the brim with the grains, as well as the fermented\r\nliquor, the guests, when they pledged one another, drank together\r\nout of the same bowl by stooping down to it, although, when this\r\ntoken of friendship was not intended, they adopted the more refined\r\nmethod of sucking up the fluid through tubes of cane. The Suevi and\r\nother northern nations offered to their gods libations of beer, and\r\nexpected that to drink it in the presence of Odin would be among the\r\ndelights of Valhalla.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĒRŌMA (κήρωμα), the oil mixed with wax (κηρός) with which wrestlers\r\nwere anointed; also the place where they were anointed, and, in later\r\ntimes, the place where they wrestled.\r\n\r\n\r\nCĔRŪCHI. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCESTRUM. [PICTURA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCESTUS. (1) The thongs or bands of leather, which were tied round\r\nthe hands of boxers, in order to render their blows more powerful\r\n(ἱμάντες, or ἱμάντες πυκτικοί). The cestus was used by boxers in the\r\nearliest times, and is mentioned in the Iliad; but in the heroic\r\ntimes it consisted merely of thongs of leather, and differed from the\r\ncestus used in later times in the public games, which was a most\r\nformidable weapon, being frequently covered with knots and nails, and\r\nloaded with lead and iron.--(2) A band or tie of any kind, but more\r\nparticularly the zone or girdle of Venus, on which was represented\r\nevery thing that could awaken love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cestus. (Fabretti, de Col. Traj., p. 261.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCETRA, or CAETRA, a target, _i.e._ a small round shield, made of the\r\nhide of a quadruped. It formed part of the defensive armour of the\r\nOsci, and of the people of Spain, Mauritania, and Britain, and seems\r\nto have been much the same as the target of the Scotch Highlanders.\r\nThe Romans do not appear to have used the cetra; but we find mention\r\nof _cetratae cohortes_ levied in the provinces. Livy compares it to\r\nthe _pelta_ of the Greeks and Macedonians, which was also a small\r\nlight shield.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALCĬOĒCĬA (χαλκιοίκια), an annual festival, with sacrifices, held\r\nat Sparta in honour of Athena, surnamed _Chalcioecus_ (Χαλκίοικος),\r\ni.e. the goddess of the brazen-house. Young men marched on the\r\noccasion in full armour to the temple of the goddess; and the ephors,\r\nalthough not entering the temple, but remaining within its sacred\r\nprecincts, were obliged to take part in the sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALCUS (χαλκοῦς), a denomination of Greek copper-money. Bronze or\r\ncopper (χαλκός) was very little used by the Greeks for money till\r\nafter the time of Alexander the Great. The χαλκία πονηρὰ at Athens\r\nissued in B.C. 406 were a peculiar exception; and they were soon\r\nafterwards called in, and the silver currency restored. It is not\r\nimprobable, however, that the copper coin called χαλκοῦς was in\r\ncirculation in Athens still earlier. The smallest silver coin at\r\nAthens was the quarter-obol, and the χαλκοῦς was the half of that, or\r\nthe eighth of an obol. Its value was somewhat more than 3-4ths of a\r\nfarthing. The χαλκοῦς in later times was divided into lepta, of which\r\nit contained seven. In later times the obol was coined of copper as\r\nwell as silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHĂRISTĬA (from χαρίζομαι, to grant a favour or pardon), a solemn\r\nfeast among the Romans, to which none but relations and members\r\nof the same family were invited, in order that any quarrel or\r\ndisagreement which had arisen amongst them might be made up. The day\r\nof celebration was the 19th of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEIRŎNŎMĬA (χειρονομία), a mimetic movement of the hands, which\r\nformed a part of the art of dancing among the Greeks and Romans. In\r\ngymnastics it was applied to the movements of the hands in pugilistic\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEIRŎTŎNĬA (χειροτονία). In the Athenian assemblies two modes\r\nof voting were practised, the one by pebbles (ψηφίζεσθαι), the\r\nother by a show of hands (χειροτονεῖν). The latter was employed in\r\nthe election of those magistrates who were chosen in the public\r\nassemblies, and who were hence called χειροτονητοί, in voting upon\r\nlaws, and in some kinds of trials on matters which concerned the\r\npeople. We frequently find, however, the word ψηφίζεσθαι used where\r\nthe votes were really given by show of hands. The manner of voting\r\nby a show of hands was as follows:--The herald said: “Whoever thinks\r\nthat Meidias is guilty, let him lift up his hand.” Then those who\r\nthought so stretched forth their hands. Then the herald said again:\r\n“Whoever thinks that Meidias is not guilty, let him lift up his\r\nhand;” and those who were of this opinion stretched forth their\r\nhands. The number of hands was counted each time by the herald; and\r\nthe president, upon the herald’s report, declared on which side the\r\nmajority voted. It is important to understand clearly the compounds\r\nof this word. A vote condemning an accused person is καταχειροτονία:\r\none acquitting him, ἀποχειροτονία; ἐπιχειροτονεῖν is to confirm by\r\na majority of votes: ἐπιχειροτονία τῶν νομῶν was a revision of the\r\nlaws, which took place at the beginning of every year: ἐπιχειροτονία\r\nτῶν ἀρχῶν was a vote taken in the first assembly of each prytany on\r\nthe conduct of the magistrates; in these cases, those who voted for\r\nthe confirmation of the law, or for the continuance in office of\r\nthe magistrate, were said ἐπιχειροτονεῖν, those on the other side\r\nἀποχειροτονεῖν: διαχειροτονία is a vote for one of two alternatives:\r\nἀντιχειροτονεῖν, to vote against a proposition. The compounds of\r\nψηφίζεσθαι have similar meanings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHĪRŎGRĂPHUM (χειρόγραφον), meant first, as its derivation implies, a\r\nhand-writing or autograph. In this its simple sense, χείρ in Greek and\r\n_manus_ in Latin are often substituted for it. From this meaning was\r\neasily derived that of a signature to a will or other instrument,\r\nespecially a note of hand given by a debtor to his creditor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHITON (χιτών). [TUNICA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLAENA (χλαῖνα). [PALLIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chlamys. (The Figure on the left from a Painting on a\r\nVase; that on the right from the Brit. Mus.)]\r\n\r\nCHLĂMỸS (χλαμύς, _dim._ χλαμύδιον), a scarf, denoted an article of\r\nthe _amictus_, or outer raiment of the Greeks. It was for the most\r\npart woollen; and it differed from the _himation_ (ἱμάτιον), or\r\ncloak, the usual amictus of the male sex, in being smaller, finer,\r\nand oblong instead of square, its length being generally about twice\r\nits breadth. The scarf does not appear to have been much worn by\r\nchildren. It was generally assumed on reaching adolescence, and was\r\nworn by the ephebi from about seventeen to twenty years of age, and\r\nhence was called χλαμὺς ἐφηβηική. It was also worn by the military,\r\nespecially of high rank, over their body armour, and by hunters and\r\ntravellers, more particularly on horseback. The usual mode of wearing\r\nthe scarf was to pass one of its shorter sides round the neck, and\r\nto fasten it by means of a brooch (_fibula_), either over the breast\r\n(cut, HASTA), in which case it hung down the back, or over the\r\nright shoulder, so as to cover the left arm (cut, CAUSIA). In the\r\nfollowing cut it is worn again in another way. The aptitude of the\r\nscarf to be turned in every possible form around the body, made it\r\nuseful even for defence. The hunter used to wrap his chlamys about\r\nhis left arm when pursuing wild animals, and preparing to fight with\r\nthem. The annexed woodcut exhibits a figure of Neptune armed with the\r\ntrident in his right hand, and having a chlamys to protect the left.\r\nWhen Diana goes to the chase, as she does not require her scarf for\r\npurposes of defence, she draws it from behind over her shoulders,\r\nand twists it round her waist so that the belt of her quiver passes\r\nacross it. (See woodcut.) Among the Romans the scarf came more\r\ninto use under the emperors. Caligula wore one enriched with gold.\r\nSeverus, when he was in the country or on an expedition, wore a scarf\r\ndyed with the coccus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chlamys. (Neptune from a Coin, and Diana from a Statue\r\nin the Vatican.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOENIX (χοῖνιξ), a Greek measure of capacity, the size of which is\r\ndifferently given; it was probably of different sizes in the several\r\nstates. Some writers make it equal to three cotylae (nearly 1½ pints\r\nEnglish); others to four cotylae (nearly 2 pints English); others\r\nagain make it eight cotylae (nearly 4 pints English).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHŎRĒGUS (χορηγός), a person who had to bear the expenses of the\r\nchoregia (χορηγία), one of the regularly recurring state burthens\r\n(ἐγκύκλιοι λειτουργίαι) at Athens. The choregus was appointed by his\r\ntribe, though we are not informed according to what order. The same\r\nperson might serve as choregus for two tribes at once; and after B.C.\r\n412 a decree was passed allowing two persons to unite and undertake a\r\nchoregia together. The duties of the choregia consisted in providing\r\nthe choruses for tragedies and comedies, the lyric choruses of men\r\nand boys, the pyrrhicists, the cyclic choruses, and the choruses of\r\nflute-players for the different religious festivals at Athens. When\r\na poet intended to bring out a play, he had to get a chorus assigned\r\nhim by the archon [CHORUS], who nominated a choregus to fulfil the\r\nrequisite duties. He had first to collect his chorus, and then to\r\nprocure a teacher (χοροδιδάσκαλος), whom he paid for instructing the\r\nchoreutae. The chorus were generally maintained, during the period\r\nof their instruction, at the expense of the choregus. The choregus\r\nwho exhibited the best musical or theatrical entertainment received\r\nas a prize a tripod, which he had the expense of consecrating, and\r\nsometimes he had also to build the monument on which it was placed.\r\nThere was a whole street at Athens formed by the line of these\r\ntripod-temples, and called “The Street of the Tripods.”\r\n\r\nCHŎRUS (χορός) probably signified originally a company of dancers\r\ndancing in a ring. In later times, a choric performance always\r\nimplies the singing or musical recitation of a poetical composition,\r\naccompanied by appropriate dancing and gesticulation, or at least\r\nby a measured march. In all the Dorian states, especially among the\r\nSpartans, choral performances were cultivated with great assiduity.\r\nVarious causes contributed to this, as, for example, their universal\r\nemployment in the worship of Apollo, the fact that they were not\r\nconfined to the men, but that women also took part in them, and that\r\nmany of the dances had a gymnastic character given them, and were\r\nemployed as a mode of training to martial exercises. [SALTATIO.]\r\nHence Doric lyric poetry became almost exclusively choral, which\r\nwas not the case with the other great school of Greek lyric poetry,\r\nthe Aeolian; so that the Doric dialect came to be looked upon as\r\nthe appropriate dialect for choral compositions, and Doric forms\r\nwere retained by the Athenians even in the choral compositions\r\nwhich were interwoven with their dramas. The instrument commonly\r\nused in connection with the Doric choral poetry was the cithara.\r\nA great impetus was given to choral poetry by its application to\r\nthe dithyramb. This ancient Bacchanalian performance seems to have\r\nbeen a hymn sung by one or more of an irregular band of revellers,\r\nto the music of the flute. Arion, a contemporary of Periander, was\r\nthe first who gave a regular choral form to the dithyramb. This\r\nchorus, which ordinarily consisted of fifty men or youths, danced\r\nin a ring round the altar of Dionysus. Hence such choruses were\r\ntermed _cyclic_ (κύκλιοι χοροί). With the introduction of a regular\r\nchoral character, Arion also substituted the cithara for the flute.\r\nIt was from the dithyramb that the Attic tragedy was developed. For\r\ndetails see TRAGOEDIA. From the time of Sophocles onwards the regular\r\nnumber of the chorus in a tragedy was 15; but it is impossible to\r\narrive at any definite conclusion with regard to the number of the\r\nchorus in the early dramas of Aeschylus. The fact that the number\r\nof the dithyrambic chorus was 50, and that the mythological number\r\nof the Oceanides and Danaides was the same, tempts one to suppose\r\nthat the chorus in the Prometheus and the Supplices consisted of\r\n50. Most writers, however, agree in thinking that such a number was\r\ntoo large to have been employed. The later chorus of 15 was arranged\r\nin a quadrangular form (τετράγωνος). It entered the theatre by the\r\npassage to the right of the spectators. [THEATRUM.] Its entrance\r\nwas termed πάροδος; its leaving the stage in the course of the play\r\nμετάστασις; its re-entrance ἐπιπάροδος; its exit ἄφοδος. As it\r\nentered in three lines, with the spectators on its left, the stage on\r\nits right, the middle choreutes of the left row (τρίτος ἀριστέρου)\r\nwas the Coryphaeus or Hegemon, who in early times at least was not\r\nunfrequently the choregus himself. Of course the positions first\r\ntaken up by the choreutae were only retained till they commenced\r\ntheir evolutions. To guide them in these, lines were marked upon\r\nthe boards with which the orchestra was floored. The flute as well\r\nas the cithara was used as an accompaniment to the choric songs.\r\nThe dance of the tragic chorus was called ἐμμέλεια.--The ordinary\r\nnumber of the chorus in a comedy was 24. Like the tragic chorus it\r\nwas arranged in a quadrangular form, and entered the orchestra from\r\nopposite sides, according as it was supposed to come from the city\r\nor from the country. It consisted sometimes half of male and half of\r\nfemale choreutae. The dance of the comic chorus was the κόρδαξ. In\r\nthe Satyric drama the chorus consisted of Satyrs: its number is quite\r\nuncertain. Its dance was called σίκιννις. When a poet intended to\r\nbring forward a play, he had to apply for a chorus (χορὸν αἰτεῖν) to\r\nthe archons, to the king archon if the play was to be brought forward\r\nat the Lenaea, to the archon eponymus if at the great Dionysia.\r\nIf the play were thought to deserve it, he received a chorus\r\n(χορὸν λαμβάνειν), the expenses of which were borne by a choregus.\r\n[CHOREGUS.] The poet then either trained (διδάσκειν) the chorus\r\nhimself, or entrusted that business to a professed chorus trainer\r\n(χοροδιδάσκαλος), who usually had an assistant (ὑποδιδάσκαλος).\r\nFor training the chorus in its evolutions there was also an\r\nὀρχηστοδιδάσκαλος.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOUS, or CHOEUS (χοῦς or χοεῦς), was equal to the Roman congius,\r\nand contained six ξέσται, or sextarii (nearly six pints English).\r\nIt seems that there was also a smaller measure of the same name,\r\ncontaining two sextarii (nearly two pints English).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRŎNOLŎGĬA (χρονολογία), chronology. The Greeks reckoned their\r\nyears generally according to their magistrates, in the early times\r\naccording to the years of the reign of their kings, and afterwards\r\naccording to their annual magistrates. At Athens the year was called\r\nby the name of one of the nine archons, who from this circumstance\r\nwas called ἄρχων ἐπώνυμος, or the archon par excellence; and at\r\nSparta the years were called after one of the five ephors, who for\r\nthis reason was likewise termed ἐπώνυμος. In Argos time was counted\r\naccording to the years of the high priestess of Hera, who held her\r\noffice for life (ἡρεσίς); and the inhabitants of Elis probably\r\nreckoned according to the Olympic games, which were celebrated every\r\nfifth year during the first full moon which followed after the summer\r\nsolstice. Thus there was no era which was used by _all_ the Greeks in\r\ncommon for the ordinary purposes of life.--Timaeus, who flourished\r\nabout B.C. 260, was the first historian who counted the years by\r\nOlympiads, each of which contained four years. The beginning of the\r\nOlympiads is commonly fixed in the year 3938 of the Julian period, or\r\nin B.C. 776. If we want to reduce any given Olympiad to years before\r\nChrist, _e.g._ Ol. 87, we take the number of the Olympiads actually\r\nelapsed, that is, 86, multiply it by 4, and deduct the number\r\nobtained from 776, so that the first year of the 87th Ol. will be the\r\nsame as the year 432 B.C. If the number of Olympiads amounts to more\r\nthan 776 years, that is, if the Olympiad falls after the birth of\r\nChrist, the process is the same as before, but from the sum obtained\r\nby multiplying the Olympiads by 4, we must deduct the number 776, and\r\nwhat remains is the number of the years after Christ. As the Olympic\r\ngames were celebrated 293 times, we have 293 Olympic cycles, that is,\r\n1172 years, 776 of which fall before, and 396 after Christ.--Some\r\nwriters also adopted the Trojan era, the fall of Troy being placed\r\nby Eratosthenes and those who adopted this era, in the year B.C.\r\n1184. After the time of Alexander the Great, several other eras were\r\nintroduced in the kingdoms that arose out of his empire. The first\r\nwas the Philippic era, sometimes also called the era of Alexander or\r\nthe era of Edessa; it began on the 12th of November B.C. 324, the\r\ndate of the accession of Philip Arrhidaeus. The second was the era of\r\nthe Seleucidae, beginning on the 1st of October B.C. 312, the date\r\nof the victory of Seleucus Nicator at Gaza, and of his re-conquest\r\nof Babylonia. This era was used very extensively in the East. The\r\nChaldaean era differed from it only by six months, beginning in the\r\nspring of B.C. 311. Lastly, the eras of Antioch, of which there were\r\nthree, but the one most commonly used began in November B.C. 49.--The\r\nRomans during the time of the republic reckoned their years by the\r\nnames of the consuls, which were registered in the Fasti. Along\r\nwith this era there existed another, used only by the historians.\r\nIt reckoned the years from the foundation of the city (_ab urbe\r\ncondita_); but the year of the foundation of the city was a question\r\nof uncertainty among the Romans themselves. M. Terentius Varro placed\r\nit on the 21st of April in the third year of the 6th Olympiad, that\r\nis, B.C. 753; and this is the era most commonly used. To find out\r\nthe year B.C. corresponding to the year A.U.C., subtract the year\r\nA.U.C. from 754; thus 605 A.U.C. = 149 B.C. To find out the year A.D.\r\ncorresponding to the year A.U.C., subtract 753 from the year A.U.C.;\r\nthus 767 A.U.C. = 14 A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRȲSENDĔTA, costly dishes used by the Romans at their\r\nentertainments, apparently made of silver, with golden ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIDĂRIS.

Cippi were used for various purposes; the decrees of\r\nthe senate were sometimes inscribed upon them; and with distances\r\nengraved upon them, they also served as mile-stones. They were,\r\nhowever, more frequently employed as sepulchral monuments. It was\r\nalso usual to place at one corner of the burying-ground a cippus, on\r\nwhich the extent of the burying-ground was marked, towards the road\r\n(_in fronte_), and backwards to the fields (_in agrum_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cippus, in the Vatican.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCENSES LŪDI. [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCĬTŌRES, or CIRCŬĬTŌRES. [CASTRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan of the Circus.]\r\n\r\nCIRCUS. When Tarquinius Priscus had taken the town of Apiolae from\r\nthe Latins, he commemorated his success by an exhibition of races\r\nand pugilistic contests in the Murcian valley, between the Palatine\r\nand Aventine hills, around which a number of temporary platforms\r\nwere erected by the patres and equites, called _spectacula_,\r\n_fori_, or _foruli_, from their resemblance to the deck of a ship;\r\neach one raising a stage for himself, upon which he stood to view\r\nthe games. This course, with its surrounding scaffoldings, was\r\ntermed circus; either because the spectators stood round to see\r\nthe shows, or because the procession and races went round in a\r\ncircuit. Previously, however, to the death of Tarquin, a permanent\r\nbuilding was constructed for the purpose, with regular tiers of\r\nseats in the form of a theatre. To this the name of Circus Maximus\r\nwas subsequently given, as a distinction from the Flaminian and\r\nother similar buildings, which it surpassed in extent and splendour;\r\nand hence it is often spoken of as _the_ Circus, without any\r\ndistinguishing epithet. Of the Circus Maximus scarcely a vestige now\r\nremains; but this loss is fortunately supplied by the remains of a\r\nsmall circus on the Via Appia, the ground-plan of which is in a state\r\nof considerable preservation: it is represented in the annexed cut,\r\nand may be taken as a model of all others. Around the double lines\r\n(A, A) were arranged the seats (_gradus_, _sedilia_, _subsellia_), as\r\nin a theatre, termed collectively the _cavea_; the lowest of which\r\nwere separated from the ground by a _podium_, and the whole divided\r\nlongitudinally by _praecinctiones_, and diagonally into _cunei_, with\r\ntheir _vomitoria_ attached to each. [AMPHITHEATRUM.] Towards the\r\nextremity of the upper branch of the _cavea_, the general outline\r\nis broken by an outwork (B), which was probably the _pulvinar_, or\r\nstation for the emperor, as it is placed in the best situation for\r\nseeing both the commencement and end of the course, and in the most\r\nprominent part of the circus. In the opposite branch is observed\r\nanother interruption to the uniform line of seats (C), betokening\r\nalso, from its construction, a place of distinction; which might have\r\nbeen assigned to the person at whose expense the games were given\r\n(_editor spectaculorum_). In the centre of the area was a low wall\r\n(D) running lengthways down the course, which, from its resemblance\r\nto the position of the dorsal bone in the human frame, was termed\r\n_spina_. At each extremity of the spina were placed, upon a base (E,\r\nE), three wooden cylinders, of a conical shape, like cypress trees,\r\nwhich were called _metae_--the goals. Their situation is distinctly\r\nseen in the cut on p. 89. The most remarkable objects upon the\r\n_spina_ were two columns (F) supporting seven conical balls, which,\r\nfrom their resemblance to eggs, were called _ova_. Their use was to\r\nenable the spectators to count the number of rounds which had been\r\nrun; and they were seven in number, because seven was the number of\r\nthe circuits made in each race. As each round was run, one of the\r\n_ova_ was either put up or taken down. An egg was adopted for this\r\npurpose, in honour of Castor and Pollux. At the other extremity of\r\nthe spina were two similar columns (G), sustaining dolphins, termed\r\n_delphinae_, or _delphinarum columnae_, which do not appear to have\r\nbeen intended to be removed, but only placed there as corresponding\r\nornaments to the _ova_; and the figure of the dolphin was selected in\r\nhonour of Neptune. These figures are also seen in the cut on p. 89.\r\nAt the extremity of the circus in which the two horns of the _cavea_\r\nterminate, were placed the stalls for the horses and chariots (H,\r\nH), commonly called _carceres_, but more anciently the whole line of\r\nbuilding at this end of the circus was termed _oppidum_: hence in the\r\ncircus, of which the plan is given above, we find two towers (I, I)\r\nat each end of the _carceres_. The number of _carceres_ is supposed\r\nto have been usually twelve, as in this plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carceres opening of the Gates. (From a marble at\r\nVelletri.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carceres, with Gates open. (Marble in British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThey were vaults, closed in front by gates of open wood-work\r\n(_cancelli_), which were opened simultaneously upon the signal\r\nbeing given, by removing a rope attached to pilasters of the kind\r\ncalled _Hermae_, placed for that purpose between each stall, upon\r\nwhich the gates were immediately thrown open by a number of men, as\r\nrepresented in the preceding woodcut. The cut below represents a set\r\nof four _carceres_, with their _Hermae_, and _cancelli_ open, as\r\nleft after the chariots had started; in which the gates are made to\r\nopen inwards. The preceding account and woodcuts will be sufficient\r\nto explain the meaning of the various words by which the _carceres_\r\nwere designated in poetical language, namely, _claustra_, _crypta_,\r\n_fauces_, _ostia_, _fores carceris_, _repagula_, _limina equorum_.\r\nThere were five entrances to the circus; one (L) in the centre of\r\nthe carceres, called _porta pompae_, because it was the one through\r\nwhich the Circensian procession entered, and the others at M, M, N,\r\nand O. At the entrance of the course, exactly in the direction of the\r\nline (J, K), were two small pedestals (_hermuli_) on each side of\r\nthe _podium_, to which was attached a chalked rope (_alba linea_),\r\nfor the purpose of making the start fair, precisely as is practised\r\nat Rome for the horse-races during Carnival. Thus, when the doors\r\nof the _carceres_ were thrown open, if any of the horses rushed out\r\nbefore the others, they were brought up by this rope until the whole\r\nwere fairly abreast, when it was loosened from one side, and all\r\npoured into the course at once. This line was also called _calx_,\r\nand _creta_. The _metae_ served only to regulate the turnings of\r\nthe course, the _alba linea_ answered to the starting and winning\r\npost of modern days.--From this description the Circus Maximus\r\ndiffered little, except in size and magnificence of embellishment.\r\nThe numbers which the Circus Maximus was capable of containing are\r\ncomputed at 150,000 by Dionysius, 260,000 by Pliny, and 385,000 by\r\nP. Victor, all of which are probably correct, but have reference\r\nto different periods of its history. Its length, in the time of\r\nJulius Caesar, was three stadia, the width one, and the depth of\r\nthe buildings occupied half a stadium. When the Circus Maximus was\r\npermanently formed by Tarquinius Priscus, each of the thirty curiae\r\nhad a particular place assigned to it; but as no provision was made\r\nfor the plebeians in this circus, it is supposed that the Circus\r\nFlaminius was designed for the games of the commonalty, who in early\r\ntimes chose their tribunes there, on the Flaminian field. However,\r\nin the latter days of the republic, these invidious distinctions\r\nwere lost, and all classes sat promiscuously in the circus. The\r\nseats were then marked off at intervals by a line or groove drawn\r\nacross them (_linea_), so that the space included between two lines\r\nafforded sitting room for a certain number of spectators. Under the\r\nempire, however, the senators and equites were separated from the\r\ncommon people. The seat of the emperor (_pulvinar or cubiculum_)\r\nwas most likely in the same situation in the Circus Maximus as in\r\nthe one above described.--The Circensian games (_Ludi Circenses_)\r\nwere first instituted by Romulus, according to the legends, when he\r\nwished to attract the Sabine population to Rome, for the purpose of\r\nfurnishing his own people with wives, and were celebrated in honour\r\nof the god Consus, or Neptunus Equestris, from whom they were styled\r\n_Consuales_. But after the construction of the Circus Maximus they\r\nwere called indiscriminately _Circenses_, _Romani_, or _Magni_. They\r\nembraced six kinds of games:--I. CURSUS; II. LUDUS TROJAE; III. PUGNA\r\nEQUESTRIS; IV. CERTAMEN GYMNICUM; V. VENATIO; VI. NAUMACHIA. The two\r\nlast were not peculiar to the circus, but were exhibited also in\r\nthe amphitheatre, or in buildings appropriated for them. The games\r\ncommenced with a grand procession (_Pompa Circensis_), in which all\r\nthose who were about to exhibit in the circus, as well as persons of\r\ndistinction, bore a part. The statues of the gods formed the most\r\nconspicuous feature in the show, which were paraded upon wooden\r\nplatforms, called _fercula_ and _thensae_. The former were borne\r\nupon the shoulders, as the statues of saints are carried in modern\r\nprocessions; the latter were drawn along upon wheels.--I. CURSUS,\r\nthe races. The carriage usually employed in the circus was drawn\r\nby two or four horses (_bigae_, _quadrigae_). [CURRUS.] The usual\r\nnumber of chariots which started for each race was four. The drivers\r\n(_aurigae_, _agitatores_) were also divided into four companies, each\r\ndistinguished by a different colour, to represent the four seasons of\r\nthe year, and called a _factio_: thus _factio prasina_, the green,\r\nrepresented the spring; _factio russata_, red, the summer; _factio\r\nveneta_, azure, the autumn; and _factio alba_ or _albata_, white,\r\nthe winter. Originally there were but two factions, _albata_ and\r\n_russata_, and consequently only two chariots started at each race.\r\nThe driver stood in his car within the reins, which went round his\r\nback. This enabled him to throw all his weight against the horses,\r\nby leaning backwards; but it greatly enhanced his danger in case\r\nof an upset. To avoid this peril, a sort of knife or bill-hook was\r\ncarried at the waist, for the purpose of cutting the reins in a case\r\nof emergency. When all was ready, the doors of the carceres were\r\nflung open, and the chariots were formed abreast of the _alba linea_\r\nby men called _moratores_ from their duty; the signal for the start\r\nwas then given by the person who presided at the games, sometimes by\r\nsound of trumpet, or more usually by letting fall a napkin; whence\r\nthe Circensian games are called _spectacula mappae_. The _alba linea_\r\nwas then cast off, and the race commenced, the extent of which was\r\nseven times round the _spina_, keeping it always on the left. A\r\ncourse of seven circuits was termed _unus missus_, and twenty-five\r\nwas the number of races run in each day, the last of which was called\r\n_missus aerarius_, because in early times the expense of it was\r\ndefrayed by a collection of money (_aes_) made amongst the people.\r\nThe victor descended from his car at the conclusion of the race, and\r\nascended the _spina_, where he received his reward (_bravium_, from\r\nthe Greek βραβεῖον), which consisted in a considerable sum of money.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chariot Race in the Circus. (Florentine Gem.)]\r\n\r\nThe horse-racing followed the same rules as the chariots. The\r\nenthusiasm of the Romans for these races exceeded all bounds. Lists\r\nof the horses (_libella_), with their names and colours, and those\r\nof the drivers, were handed about, and heavy bets made upon each\r\nfaction; and sometimes the contests between two parties broke out\r\ninto open violence and bloody quarrels, until at last the disputes\r\nwhich originated in the circus had nearly lost the Emperor Justinian\r\nhis crown.--II. LUDUS TROJAE, a sort of sham-fight, said to have been\r\ninvented by Aeneas, performed by young men of rank on horseback,\r\nand often exhibited by the emperors.--III. PUGNA EQUESTRIS ET\r\nPEDESTRIS, a representation of a battle, upon which occasions a camp\r\nwas formed in the circus.--IV. CERTAMEN GYMNICUM. See ATHLETAE, and\r\nthe references to the articles there given.--V. [VENATIO.]--VI.\r\n[NAUMACHIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cisium. (From monument at Igel, near Treves.)]\r\n\r\nCĬSĬUM, a light open carriage with two wheels, adapted to carry two\r\npersons rapidly from place to place. The cisia were quickly drawn\r\nby mules. Cicero mentions the case of a messenger who travelled 56\r\nmiles in 10 hours in such vehicles, which were kept for hire at the\r\nstations along the great roads; a proof that the ancients considered\r\nsix Roman miles per hour as an extraordinary speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cista. (From a Painting on a Vase.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCISTA (κίστη). (1) A small box or chest, in which anything might\r\nbe placed, but more particularly applied to the small boxes which\r\nwere carried in procession in the festivals of Demeter and Dionysus.\r\nThese boxes, which were always kept closed in the public processions,\r\ncontained sacred things connected with the worship of these deities.\r\nIn the representations of Dionysiac processions on ancient vases\r\nwomen carrying cistae are frequently introduced.--(2) The ballot-box,\r\ninto which those who voted in the comitia and in the courts of\r\njustice cast their tabellae. It is represented in the annexed cut,\r\nand should not be confounded with the _situla_ or _sitella_, into\r\nwhich sortes or lots were thrown. [SITULA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCISTŎPHŎRUS (κιστοφόρος), a silver coin, which is supposed to belong\r\nto Rhodes, and which was in general circulation in Asia Minor at the\r\ntime of the conquest of that country by the Romans. It took its name\r\nfrom the device upon it, which was either the sacred chest (_cista_)\r\nof Bacchus, or more probably a flower called κιστός. Its value is\r\nextremely uncertain: some writers suppose it to have been worth in\r\nour money about 7¼_d._\r\n\r\n\r\nCĬTHĂRA. [LYRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĪVIS. [CIVITAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCĪVĬTAS, citizenship. (1) GREEK (πολιτεία). Aristotle defines a\r\ncitizen (πολίτης) to be one who is a partner in the legislative\r\nand judicial power (μέτοχος κρίσεως καὶ ἀρχῆς). No definition will\r\nequally apply to all the different states of Greece, or to any single\r\nstate at different times; the above seems to comprehend more or less\r\nproperly all those whom the common use of language entitled to the\r\nname. A state in the heroic ages was the government of a prince; the\r\ncitizens were his subjects, and derived all their privileges, civil\r\nas well as religious, from their nobles and princes. The shadows\r\nof a council and assembly were already in existence, but their\r\nbusiness was to obey. Upon the whole the notion of citizenship\r\nin the heroic ages only existed so far as the condition of aliens\r\nor of domestic slaves was its negative. The rise of a dominant\r\nclass gradually overthrew the monarchies of ancient Greece. Of\r\nsuch a class, the chief characteristics were good birth and the\r\nhereditary transmission of privileges, the possession of land, and\r\nthe performance of military service. To these characters the names\r\n_gamori_ (γάμοροι), _knights_ (ἱππεῖς), _eupatridae_ (εὐπατρίδαι),\r\n&c. severally correspond. Strictly speaking, these were the only\r\ncitizens; yet the lower class were quite distinct from bondmen or\r\nslaves. It commonly happened that the nobility occupied the fortified\r\ntowns, while the _demus_ (δῆμος) lived in the country and followed\r\nagricultural pursuits: whenever the latter were gathered within\r\nthe walls, and became seamen or handicraftsmen, the difference of\r\nranks was soon lost, and wealth made the only standard. The quarrels\r\nof the nobility among themselves, and the admixture of population\r\narising from immigrations, all tended to raise the lower orders from\r\ntheir political subjection. It must be remembered, too, that the\r\npossession of domestic slaves, if it placed them in no new relation\r\nto the governing body, at any rate gave them leisure to attend to\r\nthe higher duties of a citizen, and thus served to increase their\r\npolitical efficiency. During the convulsions which followed the\r\nheroic ages, naturalisation was readily granted to all who desired\r\nit; as the value of citizenship increased, it was, of course, more\r\nsparingly bestowed. The ties of hospitality descended from the prince\r\nto the state, and the friendly relations of the Homeric heroes\r\nwere exchanged for the προξενίαι of a later period. In political\r\nintercourse, the importance of these last soon began to be felt,\r\nand the _Proxenus_ at Athens, in after times, obtained rights only\r\ninferior to actual citizenship. [HOSPITIUM.] The isopolite relation\r\nexisted, however, on a much more extended scale. Sometimes particular\r\nprivileges were granted: as ἐπιγαμία, the right of intermarriage;\r\nἔγκτησις, the right of acquiring landed property; ἀτέλεια, immunity\r\nfrom taxation, especially ἀτέλεια μετοικίου, from the tax imposed on\r\nresident aliens. All these privileges were included under the general\r\nterm ἰσοτέλεια, or ἰσοπολίτεια, and the class who obtained them were\r\ncalled ἰσοτελεῖς. They bore the same burthens with the citizens,\r\nand could plead in the courts or transact business with the people,\r\nwithout the intervention of a προστάτης, or patron. Respecting\r\nthe division of the Athenian citizens into tribes, phratriae and\r\ndemes, see the articles TRIBUS and DEMUS.--If we would picture to\r\nourselves the true notion which the Greeks embodied in the word\r\n_polis_ (πόλις), we must lay aside all modern ideas respecting the\r\nnature and object of a state. With us practically, if not in theory,\r\nthe _essential_ object of a state hardly embraces more than the\r\nprotection of life and property. The Greeks, on the other hand, had\r\nthe most vivid conception of the state as a whole, every part of\r\nwhich was to co-operate to some great end to which all other duties\r\nwere considered as subordinate. Thus the aim of democracy was said to\r\nbe liberty; wealth, of oligarchy; and education, of aristocracy. In\r\nall governments the endeavour was to draw the social union as close\r\nas possible, and it seems to have been with this view that Aristotle\r\nlaid down a principle which answered well enough to the accidental\r\ncircumstances of the Grecian states, that a _polis_ must be of a\r\ncertain size. This unity of purpose was nowhere so fully carried out\r\nas in the government of Sparta. The design of Spartan institutions\r\nwas evidently to unite the governing body among themselves against\r\nthe superior numbers of the subject population. The division of\r\nlands, the syssitia, the education of their youth, all tended to\r\nthis great object. [HELOTES; PERIOECI.] In legal rights all Spartans\r\nwere equal: but there were yet several gradations, which, when once\r\nformed, retained their hold on the aristocratic feelings of the\r\npeople. First, there was the dignity of the Heraclide families;\r\nand, connected with this, a certain pre-eminence of the Hyllean\r\ntribe. Another distinction was that between the _Homoioi_ (ὅμοιοι)\r\nand _Hypomeiones_ (ὑπομείονες), which, in later times, appears\r\nto have been considerable. The latter term probably comprehended\r\nthose citizens who, from degeneracy of manners or other causes, had\r\nundergone some kind of civil degradation. To these the _Homoioi_\r\nwere opposed, although it is not certain in what the precise\r\ndifference consisted. All the Spartan citizens were included in the\r\nthree tribes, Hylleans, Dymanes or Dymanatae, and Pamphilians, each\r\nof which was divided into ten obes or phratries. The citizens of\r\nSparta, as of most oligarchical states, were landowners, although\r\nthis does not seem to have been looked upon as an essential of\r\ncitizenship.--(2) ROMAN. _Civitas_ means the whole body of _cives_,\r\nor members, of any given state, and the word is frequently used\r\nby the Roman writers to express the rights of a Roman citizen, as\r\ndistinguished from those of other persons not Roman citizens, as\r\nin the phrases, _dare civitatem_, _donare civitate_, _usurpare\r\ncivitatem_. Some members of a political community (_cives_) may have\r\nmore political rights than others; and this was the case at Rome\r\nunder the republic, in which we find a distinction made between\r\ntwo great classes of Roman citizens, one that had, and another\r\nthat had not, a share in the sovereign power (_optimo jure_, _non\r\noptimo jure cives_). That which peculiarly distinguished the higher\r\nclass, or the _optimo jure cives_, was the right to vote in a tribe\r\n(_jus suffragiorum_), and the capacity of enjoying magistracy (_jus\r\nhonorum_). The inferior class, or the _non optimo jure cives_, did\r\nnot possess the above rights, which the Romans called _jus publicum_,\r\nbut they only had the _jus privatum_, which comprehended the _jus\r\nconnubii_ and _jus commercii_, and those who had not these had no\r\ncitizenship.--Under the empire we find the free persons who were\r\nwithin the political limits of the Roman state divided into three\r\ngreat classes. The same division probably existed in an early period\r\nof the Roman state, and certainly existed in the time of Cicero.\r\nThese classes were, _Cives_, _Latini_, and _Peregrini_. _Civis_ is he\r\nwho possesses the complete rights of a Roman citizen. _Peregrinus_\r\nwas incapable of exercising the rights of _commercium_ and\r\n_connubium_, which were the characteristic rights of a Roman citizen;\r\nbut he had a capacity for making all kinds of contracts which were\r\nallowable by the jus gentium. The _Latinus_ was in an intermediate\r\nstate; he had not the _connubium_, and consequently he had not the\r\n_patria potestas_ nor rights of agnatio; but he had the _commercium_\r\nor the right of acquiring quiritarian ownership, and he had also a\r\ncapacity for all acts incident to quiritarian ownership, as the power\r\nof making a will in Roman form, and of becoming heres under a will.\r\nThe rights of a Roman citizen were acquired in several ways, but most\r\ncommonly by a person being born of parents who were Roman citizens.\r\nA slave might obtain the civitas by manumission (_vindicta_), by the\r\ncensus, and by a testamentum, if there was no legal impediment; but\r\nit depended on circumstances whether he became a _civis Romanus_,\r\na _Latinus_, or in the number of the _peregrini dediticii_.\r\n[MANUMISSIO.] The civitas could be conferred on a foreigner by a lex,\r\nas in the case of Archias, who was a civis of Heraclea, a civitas\r\nwhich had a foedus with Rome, and who claimed the civitas Romana\r\nunder the provisions of a lex of Silvanus and Carbo, B.C. 89. By the\r\nprovisions of this lex, the person who chose to take the benefit of\r\nit was required, within sixty days after the passing of the lex, to\r\nsignify to the praetor his wish and consent to accept the civitas\r\n(_profiteri_). This lex was intended to give the civitas, under\r\ncertain limitations, to foreigners who were citizens of foederate\r\nstates (_foederatis civitatibus adscripti_). [FOEDERATAE CIVITATES.]\r\nThus the great mass of the Italians obtained the civitas, and the\r\nprivileges of the former civitates foederatae were extended to the\r\nprovinces, first to part of Gaul, and then to Sicily, under the name\r\nof Jus Latii or Latinitas. This Latinitas gave a man the right of\r\nacquiring the Roman citizenship by having exercised a magistratus\r\nin his own civitas; a privilege which belonged to the foederatae\r\ncivitates of Italy before they obtained the Roman civitas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĀRĬGĀTĬO. [FETIALES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSĬCUM. [CORNU.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĀVUS ANNĀLIS. In the early ages of Rome, when letters were yet\r\nscarcely in use, the Romans kept a reckoning of their years by\r\ndriving a nail (_clavus_), on the ides of each September, into the\r\nside walls of the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, which ceremony\r\nwas performed by the consul or a dictator.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĀVUS GŬBERNĀCŬLI. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĀVUS LĀTUS, CLĀVUS ANGUSTUS. The _clavus_, as an article of dress,\r\nseems to have been a purple band worn upon the tunic and toga, and\r\nwas of two fashions, one broad and the other narrow, denominated\r\nrespectively _clavus latus_ and _clavus angustus_. The former was a\r\nsingle broad band of purple, extending perpendicularly from the neck\r\ndown the centre of the tunic; the latter probably consisted of two\r\nnarrow purple slips, running parallel to each from the top to the\r\nbottom of the tunic, one from each shoulder. The _latus clavus_ was\r\na distinctive badge of the senatorian order; and hence it is used to\r\nsignify the senatorial dignity, and _laticlavius_, the person who\r\nenjoys it. The _angustus clavus_ was the decoration of the equestrian\r\norder; but the right of wearing the latus clavus was also given to\r\nthe children of equestrians, at least in the time of Augustus, as a\r\nprelude to entering the senate-house. This, however, was a matter\r\nof personal indulgence, and was granted only to persons of very\r\nancient family and corresponding wealth, and then by special favour\r\nof the emperor. In such cases the latus clavus was assumed with the\r\ntoga virilis, and worn until the age arrived at which the young\r\nequestrian was admissible into the senate, when it was relinquished\r\nand the angustus clavis resumed, if a disinclination on his part, or\r\nany other circumstances, prevented him from entering the senate, as\r\nwas the case with Ovid. But it seems that the latus clavus could be\r\nagain resumed if the same individual subsequently wished to become\r\na senator, and hence a fickle character is designated as one who is\r\nalways changing his clavus. The latus clavus is said to have been\r\nintroduced at Rome by Tullus Hostilius, and to have been adopted by\r\nhim after his conquest of the Etruscans; nor does it appear to have\r\nbeen confined to any particular class during the earlier periods, but\r\nto have been worn by all ranks promiscuously. It was laid aside in\r\npublic mourning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEPSȲDRA. [HOROLOGIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĒRŪCHI (κληροῦχοι), the name of Athenian citizens who occupied\r\nconquered lands; their possession was called _cleruchia_ (κληρουχία).\r\nThe Athenian Cleruchi differed from the ἄποικοι or ordinary\r\ncolonists. The only object of the earlier colonies was to relieve\r\nsurplus population, or to provide a home for those whom internal\r\nquarrels had exiled from their country. Most usually they originated\r\nin private enterprise, and became independent of, and lost their\r\ninterest in, the parent state. On the other hand, it was essential\r\nto the very notion of a _cleruchia_ that it should be a public\r\nenterprise, and should always retain a connection more or less\r\nintimate with Athens herself. The connection with the parent state\r\nsubsisted in all degrees. Sometimes, as in the case of Lesbos, the\r\nholders of land did not reside upon their estates, but let them to\r\nthe original inhabitants, while themselves remained at Athens. The\r\ncondition of these cleruchi did not differ from that of Athenian\r\ncitizens who had estates in Attica. All their political rights they\r\nnot only retained, but exercised as Athenians. Another case was where\r\nthe cleruchi resided on their estates, and either with or without\r\nthe old inhabitants, formed a new community. These still retained\r\nthe rights of Athenian citizens, which distance only precluded them\r\nfrom exercising: they used the Athenian courts; and if they or their\r\nchildren wished to return to Athens, naturally and of course they\r\nregained the exercise of their former privileges. Sometimes, however,\r\nthe connection might gradually dissolve, and the cleruchi sink into\r\nthe condition of mere allies, or separate wholly from the mother\r\ncountry. It was to Pericles that Athens was chiefly indebted for the\r\nextension and permanence of her colonial settlements. His principal\r\nobject was to provide for the redundancies of population, and raise\r\nthe poorer citizens to a fortune becoming the dignity of Athenian\r\ncitizens. It was of this class of persons that the settlers were\r\nchiefly composed; the state provided them with arms, and defrayed the\r\nexpenses of their journey. The Cleruchiae were lost by the battle of\r\nAegospotami, but partially restored on the revival of Athenian power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĒTĒRES or CLĒTORES (κλητῆρες, κλῆτορες), summoners, were at Athens\r\nnot official persons, but merely witnesses to the prosecutor that he\r\nhad served the defendant with a notice of the action brought against\r\nhim, and the day upon which it would be requisite for him to appear\r\nbefore the proper magistrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĪBĂNĀRĬI. [CATAPHRACTI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĬENS is said to contain the same element as the verb _cluere_,\r\nto “hear” or “obey,” and may be accordingly compared with the\r\nGerman word _höriger_, “a dependant,” from _hören_, “to hear.” In\r\nthe earliest times of the Roman state we find a class of persons\r\ncalled _clientes_, who must not be confounded with the plebeians,\r\nfrom whom they were distinct. The clients were not slaves: they had\r\nproperty of their own and freedom, and appear to have had votes in\r\nthe comitia centuriata, but they did not possess the full rights of\r\nRoman citizens; and the peculiarity of their condition consisted in\r\nevery client being in a state of dependence upon or subjection to\r\nsome patrician, who was called his _patronus_, and to whom he owed\r\ncertain rights and duties. The patronus, on the other hand, likewise\r\nincurred certain obligations towards his client. This relationship\r\nbetween patronus and cliens was expressed by the word _clientela_,\r\nwhich also expressed the whole body of a man’s clients. The relative\r\nrights and duties of the patrons and the clients were, according\r\nto Dionysius, as follows:--The patron was the legal adviser of\r\nthe cliens; he was the client’s guardian and protector, as he was\r\nthe guardian and protector of his own children; he maintained the\r\nclient’s suit when he was wronged, and defended him when another\r\ncomplained of being wronged by him: in a word, the patron was the\r\nguardian of the client’s interests, both private and public. The\r\nclient contributed to the marriage portion of the patron’s daughter,\r\nif the patron was poor; and to his ransom, or that of his children,\r\nif they were taken prisoners; he paid the costs and damages of a suit\r\nwhich the patron lost, and of any penalty in which he was condemned;\r\nhe bore a part of the patron’s expenses incurred by his discharging\r\npublic duties, or filling the honourable places in the state. Neither\r\nparty could accuse the other, or bear testimony against the other,\r\nor give his vote against the other. This relationship between patron\r\nand client subsisted for many generations, and resembled in all\r\nrespects the relationship by blood. The relation of a master to his\r\nliberated slave (_libertus_) was expressed by the word _patronus_,\r\nand the libertus was the cliens of his patronus. Distinguished\r\nRomans were also the protectors of states and cities, which were in\r\na certain relation of subjection or dependence to Rome. In the time\r\nof Cicero we also find _patronus_ in the sense of adviser, advocate,\r\nor defender, opposed to _cliens_ in the sense of the person defended\r\nor the consultor,--a use of the word which must be referred to the\r\noriginal character of the patronus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĬENTĒLA. [CLIENS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĬPĔUS (ἀσπίς), the large shield worn by the Greeks and Romans,\r\nwhich was originally of a circular form, and is said to have been\r\nfirst used by Proetus and Acrisius of Argos, and therefore is called\r\n_clipeus Argolicus_, and likened to the sun. But the clipeus is\r\noften represented in Roman sculpture of an oblong oval, which makes\r\nthe distinction between the common buckler and that of Argos. The\r\nouter rim was termed ἄντυξ by the Greeks; and in the centre was a\r\nprojection called ὀμφάλος or _umbo_, which served as a sort of weapon\r\nby itself, or caused the missiles of the enemy to glance off from the\r\nshield. In the Homeric times, the Greeks merely used a leather strap\r\n(τελαμών) to support the shield, but subsequently a handle (ὄχανον or\r\nὀχάνη). The usual form of the clipeus is exhibited in the figure of\r\nthe Greek warrior on p. 41. When the census was instituted by Servius\r\nTullius at Rome, the first class only used the _clipeus_, and the\r\nsecond were armed with the _scutum_ [SCUTUM]; but after the Roman\r\nsoldiery received pay, the _clipeus_ was discontinued altogether for\r\nthe _scutum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLĪTELLAE, a pair of panniers, and therefore only used in the plural\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLŎĀCA, a sewer, a drain. Rome was intersected by numerous sewers,\r\nsome of which were of an immense size: the most celebrated of them\r\nwas the _cloaca maxima_, the construction of which is ascribed to\r\nTarquinius Priscus. It was formed by three tiers of arches, one\r\nwithin the other, the innermost of which is a semicircular vault\r\nof 14 feet in diameter. The manner of its construction is shown in\r\nthe preceding cut. Under the republic, the administration of the\r\nsewers was entrusted to the censors: but under the empire, particular\r\nofficers were appointed for that purpose, called _cloacarum\r\ncuratores_, who employed condemned criminals in cleansing and\r\nrepairing them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cloaca Maxima at Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŌA VESTIS, the Coan robe, was a transparent dress, chiefly worn by\r\nwomen of loose reputation. It has been supposed to have been made of\r\nsilk, because in Cos silk was spun and woven at a very early period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coa Vestis. (From a Painting at Herculaneum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎACTOR, the name of collectors of various sorts, _e.g._ the servants\r\nof the publicani, or farmers of the public taxes, who collected\r\nthe revenues for them, and those who collected the money from the\r\npurchasers of things sold at a public auction. Horace informs us that\r\nhis father was a coactor of this kind. Moreover, the servants of the\r\nmoney-changers were so called, from collecting their debts for them.\r\nThe “coactores agminis” were the soldiers who brought up the rear of\r\na line of march.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎCHLĔA (κοχλίας), which properly means a snail, was also used to\r\nsignify other things of a spiral form. (1) A screw, used in working\r\nclothes-presses, and oil and wine presses.--(2) A spiral pump for\r\nraising water, invented by Archimedes, from whom it has ever since\r\nbeen called the Archimedean screw.--(3) A peculiar kind of door\r\nthrough which the wild beasts passed from their dens into the arena\r\nof the amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCHLĔAR. (κοχλιάριον), a kind of spoon, which appears to have\r\nterminated with a point at one end, and at the other was broad and\r\nhollow like our own spoons. The pointed end was used for drawing\r\nsnails (_cochleae_) out of their shells, and eating them, whence it\r\nderived its name; and the broader part for eating eggs, &c. Cochlear\r\nwas also the name given to a small measure like our spoonful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŌDEX, identical with _caudex_, as _Claudius_ and _Clodius_,\r\n_claustrum_ and _clostrum_, _cauda_ and _coda_, originally signified\r\nthe trunk or stem of a tree. The name codex was especially applied\r\nto wooden tablets bound together and lined with a coat of wax, for\r\nthe purpose of writing upon them, and when, at a later age, parchment\r\nor paper, or other materials were substituted for wood, and put\r\ntogether in the shape of a book, the name of codex was still given\r\nto them. In the time of Cicero we find it also applied to the tablet\r\non which a bill was written. At a still later period, during the\r\ntime of the emperors, the word was used to express any collection\r\nof laws or constitutions of the emperors, whether made by private\r\nindividuals or by public authority, as the _Codex Gregorianus_,\r\n_Codex Theodosianus_, and _Codex Justinianeus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOEMPTĬO. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOENA (δεῖπνον), the principal meal of the Greeks and Romans,\r\ndinner. (1) GREEK. Three names of meals occur in the Iliad and\r\nOdyssey--_ariston_ (ἄριστον), _deipnon_ (δεῖπνον), _dorpon_ (δόρπον).\r\nThe word _ariston_ uniformly means the early, as _dorpon_ does the\r\nlate meal; but _deipnon_, on the other hand, is used for either,\r\napparently without any reference to time. In the Homeric age it\r\nappears to have been usual to sit during mealtimes. Beef, mutton,\r\nand goat’s flesh were the ordinary meats, usually eaten roasted.\r\nCheese, flour, and occasionally fruits, also formed part of the\r\nHomeric meals. Bread, brought on in baskets, and salt (ἃλς, to\r\nwhich Homer gives the epithet θεῖος), are mentioned. The Greeks\r\nof a later age usually partook of three meals, called _acratisma_\r\n(ἀκράτισμα), _ariston_, and _deipnon_. The last, which corresponds\r\nto the _dorpon_ of the Homeric poems, was the evening meal or\r\ndinner; the _ariston_ was the luncheon; and the _acratisma_, which\r\nanswers to the _ariston_ of Homer, was the early meal or breakfast.\r\nThe _acratisma_ was taken immediately after rising in the morning.\r\nIt usually consisted of bread, dipped in unmixed wine (ἄκρατος),\r\nwhence it derived its name. Next followed the _ariston_ or luncheon;\r\nbut the time at which it was taken is uncertain. It is frequently\r\nmentioned in Xenophon’s Anabasis, and appears to have been taken at\r\ndifferent times, as would naturally be the case with soldiers in\r\nactive service. We may conclude from many circumstances that this\r\nmeal was taken about the middle of the day, and that it answered\r\nto the Roman _prandium_. The _ariston_ was usually a simple meal,\r\nbut of course varied according to the habits of individuals. The\r\nprincipal meal was the _deipnon_. It was usually taken rather late\r\nin the day, frequently not before sunset. The Athenians were a social\r\npeople, and were very fond of dining in company. Entertainments\r\nwere usually given, both in the heroic ages and later times, when\r\nsacrifices were offered to the gods, either on public or private\r\noccasions; and also on the anniversary of the birthdays of members\r\nof the family, or of illustrious persons, whether living or dead.\r\nWhen young men wished to dine together they frequently contributed\r\neach a certain sum of money, called _symbole_ (συμβολή), or brought\r\ntheir own provisions with them. When the first plan was adopted,\r\nthey were said ἀπὸ συμβολῶν δειπνεῖν, and one individual was usually\r\nentrusted with the money to procure the provisions, and make all the\r\nnecessary preparations. This kind of entertainment, in which each\r\nguest contributed to the expense, is mentioned in Homer under the\r\nname of ἔρανος. An entertainment in which each person brought his own\r\nprovisions with him, or at least contributed something to the general\r\nstock, was called a δεῖπνον ἀπὸ σπυρίδος, because the provisions\r\nwere brought in baskets.--The most usual kind of entertainments,\r\nhowever, were those in which a person invited his friends to his own\r\nhouse. It was expected that they should come dressed with more than\r\nordinary care, and also have bathed shortly before. As soon as the\r\nguests arrived at the house of their host, their shoes or sandals\r\nwere taken off by the slaves and their feet washed. After their feet\r\nhad been washed, the guests reclined on the couches. It has already\r\nbeen remarked that Homer never describes persons as reclining, but\r\nalways as sitting at their meals; but at what time the change was\r\nintroduced is uncertain. The Dorians of Crete always sat; but the\r\nother Greeks reclined. The Greek women and children, however, like\r\nthe Roman, continued to sit at their meals. [ACCUBATIO.] It was usual\r\nfor only two persons to recline on each couch. After the guests had\r\nplaced themselves on the couches, the slaves brought in water to\r\nwash their hands. The dinner was then served up; whence we read of\r\nτὰς τραπέζας εἰσφέρειν, by which expression we are to understand not\r\nmerely the dishes, but the tables themselves, which were small enough\r\nto be moved with ease. In eating, the Greeks had no knives or forks,\r\nbut made use of their fingers only, except in eating soups or other\r\nliquids, which they partook of by means of a spoon, called μυστίλη,\r\nμύστρον, or μύστρος. It would exceed the limits of this work to give\r\nan account of the different dishes which were introduced at a Greek\r\ndinner, though their number is far below those which were usually\r\npartaken of at a Roman entertainment. The most common food among\r\nthe Greeks was the μάζα, a kind of frumenty or soft cake, which was\r\nprepared in different ways. Wheaten or barley bread was the second\r\nmost usual species of food; it was sometimes made at home, but more\r\nusually bought at the market of the ἀρτοπῶλαι or ἀρτοπώλιδες. The\r\nvegetables ordinarily eaten were mallows (μαλάχη), lettuces (θρίδαξ),\r\ncabbages (ῥάφανοι), beans (κύαμοι), lentils (φακαῖ), &c. Pork was\r\nthe most favourite animal food, as was the case among the Romans.\r\nIt is a curious fact, which Plato has remarked, that we never read\r\nin Homer of the heroes partaking of fish. In later times, however,\r\nfish was one of the most favourite foods of the Greeks. A dinner\r\ngiven by an opulent Athenian usually consisted of two courses, called\r\nrespectively πρῶται τράπεζαι and δεύτεραι τράπεζαι. The first course\r\nembraced the whole of what we consider the dinner, namely, fish,\r\npoultry, meat, &c.; the second, which corresponds to our dessert\r\nand the Roman _bellaria_, consisted of different kinds of fruit,\r\nsweetmeats, confections, &c. When the first course was finished, the\r\ntables were taken away, and water was given to the guests for the\r\npurpose of washing their hands. Crowns made of garlands of flowers\r\nwere also then given to them, as well as various kinds of perfumes.\r\nWine was not drunk till the first course was finished; but as soon as\r\nthe guests had washed their hands, unmixed wine was introduced in a\r\nlarge goblet, of which each drank a little, after pouring out a small\r\nquantity as a libation. This libation was said to be made to the\r\n“good spirit” (ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος), and was usually accompanied with the\r\nsinging of the paean and the playing of flutes. After this libation\r\nmixed wine was brought in, and with their first cup the guests\r\ndrank to Διὸς Σωτῆρος. With the libations the _deipnon_ closed; and\r\nat the introduction of the dessert (δεύτεραι τράπεζαι) the πότος,\r\nσυμπόσιον or κῶμος commenced, of which an account is given under\r\nSYMPOSIUM.--(2) ROMAN. As the Roman meals are not always clearly\r\ndistinguished, it will be convenient to treat of all under the most\r\nimportant one; and we shall confine ourselves to the description of\r\nthe ordinary life of the middle ranks of society in the Augustan age,\r\nnoticing incidentally the most remarkable deviations. The meal with\r\nwhich the Roman sometimes began the day was the _jentaculum_, which\r\nwas chiefly taken by children, or sick persons, or the luxurious. An\r\nirregular meal (if we may so express it) was not likely to have any\r\nvery regular time: two epigrams of Martial, however, seem to fix the\r\nhour at about three or four o’clock in the morning. Bread formed the\r\nsubstantial part of this early breakfast, to which cheese, or dried\r\nfruit, as dates and raisins, were sometimes added. Next followed the\r\n_prandium_ or luncheon, with persons of simple habits a frugal meal,\r\nusually taken about twelve or one o’clock. The _coena_, or principal\r\nmeal of the day, corresponding to our “dinner,” was usually taken\r\nabout three o’clock in the time of Cicero and Augustus, though we\r\nread of some persons not dining till near sunset. A Roman dinner\r\nat the house of a wealthy man usually consisted of three courses.\r\nThe first was called _promulsis_, _antecoena_, or _gustatio_, and\r\nwas made up of all sorts of stimulants to the appetite. Eggs also\r\nwere so indispensable to the first course that they almost gave a\r\nname to it (_ab ovo usque ad mala_). The frugality of Martial only\r\nallowed of lettuce and Sicenian olives; indeed he himself tells us\r\nthat the _promulsis_ was a refinement of modern luxury. It would far\r\nexceed our limits to mention all the dishes which formed the second\r\ncourse of a Roman dinner. Of birds, the Guinea hen (_Afra avis_), the\r\npheasant (_phasiana_, so called from Phasis, a river of Colchis),\r\nand the thrush, were most in repute; the liver of a capon steeped in\r\nmilk, and beccaficos (_ficedulae_) dressed with pepper, were held a\r\ndelicacy. The peacock, according to Macrobius, was first introduced\r\nby Hortensius the orator, at an inaugural supper, and acquired such\r\nrepute among the Roman gourmands as to be commonly sold for fifty\r\ndenarii. Other birds are mentioned, as the duck (_anas_), especially\r\nits head and breast; the woodcock (_attagen_), the turtle, and\r\nflamingo (_phoenicopterus_), the tongue of which, Martial tells us,\r\nparticularly commended itself to the delicate palate. Of fish, the\r\nvariety was perhaps still greater; the charr (_scarus_), the turbot\r\n(_rhombus_), the sturgeon (_acipenser_), the mullet (_mullus_), were\r\nhighly prized, and dressed in the most various fashions. Of solid\r\nmeat, pork seems to have been the favourite dish, especially sucking\r\npig. Boar’s flesh and venison were also in high repute: the former is\r\ndescribed by Juvenal as _animal propter convivia natum_. Condiments\r\nwere added to most of these dishes: such were the _muria_, a kind of\r\npickle made from the tunny fish; the _garum sociorum_, made from the\r\nintestines of the mackerel (_scomber_), so called because brought\r\nfrom abroad; _alec_, a sort of brine; _faex_, the sediment of wine,\r\n&c. Several kinds of _fungi_ are mentioned, truffles (_boleti_),\r\nmushrooms (_tuberes_), which either made dishes by themselves, or\r\nformed the garniture for larger dishes. It must not be supposed that\r\nthe _artistes_ of imperial Rome were at all behind ourselves in the\r\npreparation and arrangements of the table. In a large household, the\r\nfunctionaries to whom this important duty was entrusted were four,\r\nthe butler (_promus_), the cook (_archimagirus_), the arranger of the\r\ndishes (_structor_), and the carver (_carptor_ or _scissor_). Carving\r\nwas taught as an art, and performed to the sound of music, with\r\nappropriate gesticulations.\r\n\r\n      ----“minimo sane discrimine refert,\r\n      Quo vultu lepores, et quo gallina secetur.”\r\n\r\nIn the supper of Petronius, a large round tray (_ferculum_,\r\n_repositorium_) is brought in, with the signs of the zodiac figured\r\nall round it, upon each of which the _artiste_ (_structor_) had\r\nplaced some appropriate viand, a goose on Aquarius, a pair of scales\r\nwith tarts (_scriblitae_) and cheesecakes (_placentae_) in each scale\r\non Libra, &c. In the middle was placed a hive supported by delicate\r\nherbage. Presently four slaves come forward dancing to the sound of\r\nmusic, and take away the upper part of the dish; beneath appear all\r\nkinds of dressed meats; a hare with wings to imitate Pegasus, in\r\nthe middle; and four figures of Marsyas at the corners, pouring hot\r\nsauce (_garum piperatum_) over the fish, that were swimming in the\r\nEuripus below. So entirely had the Romans lost all shame of luxury,\r\nsince the days when Cincius, in supporting the Fannian law, charged\r\nhis own age with the enormity of introducing the _porcus Trojanus_, a\r\nsort of pudding stuffed with the flesh of other animals.--The third\r\ncourse was the _bellaria_ or dessert, to which Horace alludes when\r\nhe says of Tigellius _ab ovo usque ad mala citaret_; it consisted\r\nof fruits (which the Romans usually ate uncooked), such as almonds\r\n(_amygdalae_), dried grapes (_uvae passae_), dates (_palmulae_,\r\n_caryotae_, _dactyli_); of sweetmeats and confections, called _edulia\r\nmellita_, _dulciaria_, such as cheesecakes (_cupediae_, _crustula_,\r\n_liba_, _placentae_, _artolagani_), almond cakes (_coptae_),\r\ntarts (_scriblitae_), whence the maker of them was called _pistor\r\ndulciarius_, _placentarius_, _libarius_, &c. We will now suppose\r\nthe table spread and the guests assembled, each with his _mappa_ or\r\nnapkin, and in his dinner dress, called _coenatoria_ or _cubitoria_,\r\nusually of a bright colour, and variegated with flowers. First they\r\ntook off their shoes, for fear of soiling the couch, which was often\r\ninlaid with ivory or tortoise-shell, and covered with cloth of gold.\r\nNext they lay down to eat, the head resting on the left elbow and\r\nsupported by cushions. There were usually, but not always, three on\r\nthe same couch, the middle place being esteemed the most honourable.\r\nAround the tables stood the servants (_ministri_) clothed in a tunic,\r\nand girt with napkins; some removed the dishes and wiped the tables\r\nwith a rough cloth, others gave the guests water for their hands,\r\nor cooled the room with fans. Here stood an eastern youth behind\r\nhis master’s couch, ready to answer the noise of the fingers, while\r\nothers bore a large platter of different kinds of meat to the guests.\r\nDinner was set out in a room called _coenatio_ or _diaeta_ (which two\r\nwords perhaps conveyed to a Roman ear nearly the same distinction\r\nas our dining-room and parlour). The _coenatio_, in rich men’s\r\nhouses, was fitted up with great magnificence. Suetonius mentions a\r\nsupper-room in the golden palace of Nero, constructed like a theatre,\r\nwith shifting scenes to change with every course. In the midst of\r\nthe coenatio were set three couches (_triclinia_), answering in\r\nshape to the square, as the long semicircular couches (_sigmata_) did\r\nto the oval tables. An account of the disposition of the couches,\r\nand of the place which each guest occupied, is given in the article\r\nTRICLINIUM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Feast. (Vatican Virgil MS.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOENĀCŬLUM. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOENĀTĬO. [COENA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOGNĀTI, COGNĀTĬO. The _cognatio_ was the relationship of blood\r\nwhich existed between those who were sprung from a common pair;\r\nand all persons so related were called _cognati_. The foundation\r\nof _cognatio_ is a legal marriage. The term _cognatus_ (with some\r\nexceptions) comprehends _agnatus_; an _agnatus_ may be a _cognatus_,\r\nbut a _cognatus_ is only an _agnatus_ when his relationship by blood\r\nis traced through males. Those who were of the same blood by both\r\nparents were sometimes called _germani_; _consanguinei_ were those\r\nwho had a common father only; and _uterini_ those who had a common\r\nmother only.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOGNĬTOR. [ACTIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOGNŌMEN. [NOMEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎHORS. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŌLĂCRĔTAE (κωλακρέται, also called κωλαγρέται), the name of very\r\nancient magistrates at Athens, who had the management of all\r\nfinancial matters in the time of the kings. Cleisthenes deprived them\r\nof the charge of the finances, which he transferred to the Apodectae.\r\n[APODECTAE.] From this time the Colacretae had only to provide for\r\nthe meals in the Prytaneium, and subsequently to pay the fees to the\r\ndicasts, when the practice of paying the dicasts was introduced by\r\nPericles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLĒGĬUM. The persons who formed a collegium were called _collegae_\r\nor _sodales_. The word collegium properly expressed the notion\r\nof several persons being united in any office or for any common\r\npurpose; it afterwards came to signify a body of persons, and the\r\nunion which bound them together. The collegium was the ἑταιρία of\r\nthe Greeks. The legal notion of a collegium was as follows:--A\r\ncollegium or corpus, as it was also called, must consist of three\r\npersons at least. Persons who legally formed such an association were\r\nsaid _corpus habere_, which is equivalent to our phrase of being\r\nincorporated; and in later times they were said to be _corporati_,\r\nand the body was called a _corporatio_. Associations of individuals,\r\nwho were entitled to have a corpus, could hold property in common.\r\nSuch a body, which was sometimes also called a _universitas_, was\r\na legal unity. That which was due to the body, was not due to the\r\nindividuals of it; and that which the body owed, was not the debt\r\nof the individuals. The common property of the body was liable\r\nto be seized and sold for the debts of the body. It does not\r\nappear how collegia were formed, except that some were specially\r\nestablished by legal authority. Other collegia were probably formed\r\nby voluntary associations of individuals under the provisions of\r\nsome general legal authority, such as those of the publicani. Some\r\nof these corporate bodies resembled our companies or guilds; such\r\nwere the _fabrorum_, _pistorum_, &c. _collegia_. Others were of a\r\nreligious character; such as the _pontificum_, _augurum_, _fratrum\r\narvalium collegia_. Others were bodies concerned about government and\r\nadministration; as _tribunorum plebis_, _quaestorum_, _decurionum\r\ncollegia_. According to the definition of a collegium, the consuls\r\nbeing only two in number were not a collegium, though each was called\r\ncollega with respect to the other, and their union in office was\r\ncalled collegium. When a new member was taken into a collegium, he\r\nwas said _co-optari_, and the old members were said with respect to\r\nhim, _recipere in collegium_. The mode of filling up vacancies would\r\nvary in different collegia. The statement of their rules belongs to\r\nthe several heads of AUGUR, PONTIFEX, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎLŌNĬA, a colony, contains the same element as the verb _colere_,\r\n“to cultivate,” and as the word colonus, which probably originally\r\nsignified a “tiller of the earth.” (1) GREEK. The usual Greek words\r\nfor a colony are ἀποικία and κληρουχία. The latter word, which\r\nsignified a division of conquered lands among Athenian citizens,\r\nand which corresponds in some respects to the Roman _colonia_, is\r\nexplained in the article CLERUCHI. The earlier Greek colonies, called\r\nἀποικίαι, were usually composed of mere bands of adventurers, who\r\nleft their native country, with their families and property, to\r\nseek a new home for themselves. Some of the colonies, which arose\r\nin consequence of foreign invasion or civil wars, were undertaken\r\nwithout any formal consent from the rest of the community; but\r\nusually a colony was sent out with the approbation of the mother\r\ncountry, and under the management of a leader (οἰκιστής) appointed\r\nby it. But whatever may have been the origin of the colony, it was\r\nalways considered in a political point of view independent of the\r\nmother country, called by the Greeks _metropolis_ (μητρόπολις), the\r\n“mother-city,” and entirely emancipated from its control. At the\r\nsame time, though a colony was in no political subjection to its\r\nparent state, it was united to it by the ties of filial affection;\r\nand, according to the generally received opinions of the Greeks, its\r\nduties to the parent state corresponded to those of a daughter to\r\nher mother. Hence, in all matters of common interest, the colony\r\ngave precedence to the mother state; and the founder of the colony\r\n(οἰκιστής), who might be considered as the representative of the\r\nparent state, was usually worshipped, after his death, as a hero.\r\nAlso, when the colony became in its turn a parent, it usually sought\r\na leader for the colony which it intended to found from the original\r\nmother country; and the same feeling of respect was manifested by\r\nembassies which were sent to honour the principal festivals of the\r\nparent state, and also by bestowing places of honour and other marks\r\nof respect upon the ambassadors and other members of the parent\r\nstate, when they visited the colony at festivals and on similar\r\noccasions. The colonists also worshipped in their new settlement\r\nthe same deities as they had been accustomed to honour in their\r\nnative country: the sacred fire, which was constantly kept burning\r\non their public hearth, was taken from the Prytaneium of the parent\r\ncity; and sometimes the priests also were brought from the mother\r\nstate. In the same spirit, it was considered a violation of sacred\r\nties for a mother country and a colony to make war upon one another.\r\nThe preceding account of the relations between the Greek colonies\r\nand the mother country is supported by the history which Thucydides\r\ngives us of the quarrel between Corcyra and Corinth. Corcyra was\r\na colony of Corinth, and Epidamnus a colony of Corcyra; but the\r\nleader (οἰκιστής) of the colony of Epidamnus was a Corinthian who\r\nwas invited from the metropolis Corinth. In course of time, in\r\nconsequence of civil dissensions, and attacks from the neighbouring\r\nbarbarians, the Epidamnians apply for aid to Corcyra, but their\r\nrequest is rejected. They next apply to the Corinthians, who took\r\nEpidamnus under their protection, thinking, says Thucydides, that the\r\ncolony was no less theirs than the Corinthians’: and also induced to\r\ndo so through hatred of the Corcyraeans, because they neglected them\r\nthough they were colonists; for they did not give to the Corinthians\r\nthe customary honours and deference in the public solemnities and\r\nsacrifices, which the other colonies were wont to pay to the mother\r\ncountry. The Corcyraeans, who had become very powerful by sea,\r\ntook offence at the Corinthians receiving Epidamnus under their\r\nprotection, and the result was a war between Corcyra and Corinth.\r\nThe Corcyraeans sent ambassadors to Athens to ask assistance; and in\r\nreply to the objection that they were a colony of Corinth, they said,\r\n“that every colony, as long as it is treated kindly, respects the\r\nmother country: but when it is injured, is alienated from it; for\r\ncolonists are not sent out as subjects, but that they may have equal\r\nrights with those that remain at home.” It is true that ambitious\r\nstates, such as Athens, sometimes claimed dominion over other states\r\non the ground of relationship; but as a general rule, colonies may be\r\nregarded as independent states, attached to their metropolis by ties\r\nof sympathy and common descent, but no further. The case of Potidaea,\r\nto which the Corinthians sent annually the chief magistrates\r\n(δημιουργοί), appears to have been an exception to the general\r\nrule.--(2) ROMAN. A kind of colonisation seems to have existed among\r\nthe oldest Italian nations, who, on certain occasions, sent out their\r\nsuperfluous male population, with arms in their hands, to seek for a\r\nnew home. But these were apparently mere bands of adventurers, and\r\nsuch colonies rather resembled the old Greek colonies, than those\r\nby which Rome extended her dominion and her name. Colonies were\r\nestablished by the Romans as far back as the annals or traditions\r\nof the city extend, and the practice was continued, without\r\nintermission, during the republic and under the empire. Colonies\r\nwere intended to keep in check a conquered people, and also to\r\nrepress hostile incursions; and their chief object was originally\r\nthe extension and preservation of the Roman dominion in Italy.\r\nCicero calls the old Italian colonies the _propugnacula imperii_.\r\nAnother object was to increase the power of Rome by increasing the\r\npopulation. Sometimes the immediate object of a colony was to carry\r\noff a number of turbulent and discontented persons. Colonies were\r\nalso established for the purpose of providing for veteran soldiers, a\r\npractice which was begun by Sulla, and continued under the emperors;\r\nthese coloniae were called militares. The old Roman colonies were in\r\nthe nature of garrisons planted in conquered towns, and the colonists\r\nhad a portion of the conquered territory (usually a third part)\r\nassigned to them. The inhabitants retained the rest of their lands,\r\nand lived together with the new settlers, who alone composed the\r\nproper colony. The conquered people must at first have been quite\r\na distinct class from, and inferior to, the colonists. No colonia\r\nwas established without a lex, plebiscitum, or senatusconsultum;\r\na fact which shows that a Roman colony was never a mere body of\r\nadventurers, but had a regular organisation by the parent state.\r\nWhen a law was passed for founding a colony, persons were appointed\r\nto superintend its formation (_coloniam deducere_). These persons\r\nvaried in number, but three was a common number (_triumviri ad\r\ncolonos deducendos_). We also read of _duumviri_, _quinqueviri_,\r\n_vigintiviri_ for the same purpose. The law fixed the quantity of\r\nland that was to be distributed, and how much was to be assigned to\r\neach person. No Roman could be sent out as a colonist without his\r\nfree consent, and when the colony was not an inviting one, it was\r\ndifficult to fill up the number of volunteers. The colonia proceeded\r\nto its place of destination in the form of an army (_sub vexillo_),\r\nwhich is indicated on the coins of some coloniae. An urbs, if one\r\ndid not already exist, was a necessary part of a new colony, and\r\nits limits were marked out by a plough, which is also indicated on\r\nancient coins. The colonia had also a territory, which, whether\r\nmarked out by the plough or not, was at least marked out by metes\r\nand bounds. Thus the urbs and territory of the colonia respectively\r\ncorresponded to the urbs Roma and its territory. Religious ceremonies\r\nalways accompanied the foundation of the colony, and the anniversary\r\nwas afterwards observed. It is stated that a colony could not be\r\nsent out to the same place to which a colony had already been\r\nsent in due form (_auspicato deducta_). This merely means, that\r\nso long as the colony maintained its existence, there could be no\r\nnew colony in the same place; a doctrine that would hardly need\r\nproof, for a new colony implied a new assignment of lands; but new\r\nsettlers (_novi adscripti_) might be sent to occupy colonial lands\r\nnot already assigned. Indeed it was not unusual for a colony to\r\nreceive additions, and a colony might be re-established, if it seemed\r\nnecessary, from any cause. The commissioners appointed to conduct the\r\ncolony had apparently a profitable office, and the establishment of a\r\nnew settlement gave employment to numerous functionaries, among whom\r\nCicero enumerates--_apparitores_, _scribae_, _librarii_, _praecones_,\r\n_architecti_. The foundation of a colony might then, in many cases,\r\nnot only be a mere party measure, carried for the purpose of gaining\r\npopularity, but it would give those in power an opportunity of\r\nproviding places for many of their friends.--The colonies founded by\r\nthe Romans were divided into two great classes of colonies of Roman\r\ncitizens and Latin colonies; names which had no reference to the\r\npersons who formed the colonies, but merely indicated their political\r\nrights with respect to Rome as members of the colony. The members of\r\na Roman colony (_colonia civium Romanorum_) preserved all the rights\r\nof Roman citizens. The members of a Latin colony (_colonia Latina_)\r\nceased to have the full rights of Roman citizens. Probably some of\r\nthe old Latin colonies were established by the Romans in conjunction\r\nwith other Latin states. After the conquest of Latium, the Romans\r\nestablished colonies, called Latin colonies, in various parts of\r\nItaly. Roman citizens, who chose to join such colonies, gave up their\r\ncivic rights for the more solid advantage of a grant of land, and\r\nbecame LATINI. [CIVITAS.] Such colonies were subject to, and part of,\r\nthe Roman state; but they did not possess the Roman franchise, and\r\nhad no political bond among themselves.--The lex Julia, passed B.C.\r\n90, gave the Roman franchise to the members of the Latin colonies and\r\nthe Socii; and such Latin colonies and states of the Socii were then\r\ncalled _municipia_, and became complete members of the Roman state.\r\nThus there was then really no difference between these municipia and\r\nthe Roman coloniae, except in their historical origin: the members of\r\nboth were Roman citizens, and the Roman law prevailed in both.--In\r\nthe colonies, as at Rome, the popular assembly had originally the\r\nsovereign power; they chose the magistrates, and could even make\r\nlaws. When the popular assemblies became a mere form in Rome, and the\r\nelections were transferred by Tiberius to the senate, the same thing\r\nhappened in the colonies, whose senates then possessed whatever power\r\nhad once belonged to the community. The common name of this senate\r\nwas _ordo decurionum_; in later times, simply _ordo_ and _curia_; the\r\nmembers of it were _decuriones_ or _curiales_. Thus, in the later\r\nages, _curia_ is opposed to _senatus_, the former being the senate of\r\na colony, and the latter the senate of Rome. But the terms senatus\r\nand senator were also applied to the senate and members of the\r\nsenate of a colony. After the decline of the popular assemblies, the\r\nsenate had the whole internal administration of a city, conjointly\r\nwith the magistratus; but only a decurio could be a magistratus, and\r\nthe choice was made by the decuriones. The highest magistratus of\r\na colonia were the _duumviri_ or _quattuorviri_, so called, as the\r\nmembers might vary, whose functions may be compared with those of the\r\nconsulate at Rome before the establishment of the praetorship. The\r\nname _duumviri_ seems to have been the most common. Their principal\r\nduties were the administration of justice, and accordingly we find\r\non inscriptions “Duumviri J. D.” (_juri dicundo_), “Quattuorviri\r\nJ. D.” The name consul also occurs in inscriptions to denote this\r\nchief magistracy; and even dictator and praetor occur under the\r\nempire and under the republic. The office of the duumviri lasted a\r\nyear.--In some Italian towns there was a _praefectus juri dicundo_;\r\nhe was in the place of, and not co-existent with, the duumviri. The\r\nduumviri were, as we have seen, originally chosen by the people;\r\nbut the praefectus was appointed annually in Rome, and sent to the\r\ntown called a _praefectura_, which might be either a municipium or a\r\ncolonia, for it was only in the matter of the praefectus that a town\r\ncalled a praefectura differed from other Italian towns. Arpinum is\r\ncalled both a municipium and a praefectura; and Cicero, a native of\r\nthis place, obtained the highest honours that Rome could confer.--The\r\n_censor_, _curator_, or _quinquennalis_, all which names denote the\r\nsame functionary, was also a municipal magistrate, and corresponded\r\nto the censor at Rome, and in some cases, perhaps, to the quaestor\r\nalso. Censors are mentioned in Livy as magistrates of the twelve\r\nLatin colonies. The quinquennales were sometimes duumviri, sometimes\r\nquattuorviri; but they are always carefully distinguished from the\r\nduumviri and quattuorviri J. D.; and their functions were those of\r\ncensors. They held their office for one year, and during the four\r\nintermediate years the functions were not exercised. The office of\r\ncensor or quinquennalis was higher in rank than that of the duumviri\r\nJ. D., and it could only be filled by those who had discharged the\r\nother offices of the municipality.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎLOSSUS (κολοσσός) is used both by the Greeks and Romans to signify\r\na statue larger than life; but as such statues were very common, the\r\nword was more frequently applied to designate figures of gigantic\r\ndimensions. Such figures were first executed in Egypt, and were\r\nafterwards made by the Greeks and Romans. Among the colossal statues\r\nof Greece, the most celebrated was the bronze _colossus_ at Rhodes,\r\ndedicated to the sun, the height of which was about 90 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colum. (Museo Borbonico, vol. viii. pl. 14.)]\r\n\r\nCŌLUM (ἠθμός), a strainer or colander, was used for straining\r\nwine, milk, olive-oil, and other liquids. Those that were used as\r\narticles of luxury for straining wine were frequently made of some\r\nmetal, such as bronze or silver. Occasionally a piece of linen cloth\r\n(σάκκος, _saccus_) was placed over the τρύγοιπος or _colum_, and the\r\nwine (σακκίας, _saccatus_) filtered through. The use of the _saccus_\r\nwas considered objectionable for all delicate wines, since it was\r\nbelieved to injure, if not entirely to destroy their flavour, and\r\nin every instance to diminish the strength of the liquor. For this\r\nreason it was employed by the dissipated in order that they might be\r\nable to swallow a greater quantity without becoming intoxicated. The\r\ndouble purpose of cooling and weakening was effectually accomplished\r\nby placing ice or snow in the filter, which under such circumstances\r\nbecame a _colum nivarium_, or _saccus nivarius_. The preceding\r\nwoodcut shows the plan and profile of a silver colum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎLUMBĀRĬUM, a dovecot or pigeon-house, also signified a sepulchral\r\nchamber formed to receive the ashes of the lower orders, or\r\ndependants of great families; and in the plural, the niches in which\r\nthe cinerary urns (_ollae_) were deposited.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Columns.]\r\n\r\nCŎLUMNA (κίων, στύλος), a pillar or column. The use of the trunks\r\nof trees placed upright for supporting buildings, unquestionably\r\nled to the adoption of similar supports wrought in stone. As the\r\ntree required to be based upon a flat square stone, and to have\r\na stone or tile of similar form fixed on its summit to preserve\r\nit from decay, so the column was made with a square base, and was\r\ncovered with an _abacus_. [ABACUS.] Hence the principal parts of\r\nwhich every column consists are three, the base (_basis_), the shaft\r\n(_scapus_), and the capital (_capitulum_). In the Doric, which\r\nis the oldest style of Greek architecture, we must consider all\r\nthe columns in the same row as having one common base (_podium_),\r\nwhereas in the Ionic and Corinthian each column has a separate base,\r\ncalled _spira_. The capitals of these two latter orders show, on\r\ncomparison with the Doric, a much richer style of ornament; and\r\nthe character of lightness and elegance is further obtained in\r\nthem by their more slender shaft, its height being much greater in\r\nproportion to its thickness. Of all these circumstances some idea\r\nmay be formed by the inspection of the three accompanying specimens\r\nof pillars. The first on the left hand is Doric, the second Ionic,\r\nand the third Corinthian. In all the orders the shaft tapers from\r\nthe bottom towards the top. The shaft was, however, made with a\r\nslight swelling in the middle, which was called the _entasis_. It\r\nwas, moreover, almost universally channelled or fluted. Columns\r\nwere used in the interior of buildings, to sustain the beams which\r\nsupported the ceiling. Rows of columns were often employed within\r\na building, to enclose a space open to the sky. Beams supporting\r\nceilings passed from above the columns to the adjoining walls, so\r\nas to form covered passages or ambulatories (στοαί). Such a circuit\r\nof columns was called a _peristyle_ (περίστυλον), and the Roman\r\n_atrium_ was built upon this plan. The largest and most splendid\r\ntemples enclosed an open space like an atrium, which was accomplished\r\nby placing one peristyle upon another. In such cases, the lower\r\nrows of columns being Doric, the upper were sometimes Ionic or\r\nCorinthian, the lighter being properly based upon the heavier. A\r\ntemple so constructed was called _hypaethral_ (ὕπαιθρος). But it was\r\non the exterior of public buildings, and especially of temples, that\r\ncolumns were displayed in the most beautiful combinations, either\r\nsurrounding the building entirely, or arranged in porticoes on one\r\nor more of its fronts. [TEMPLUM.] Their original and proper use was,\r\nof course, to support the roof of the building; and, amidst all the\r\nelaborations of architectural design, this object was still kept in\r\nview. On the summit of the row of columns rests the _architrave_,\r\ni.e. _chief beam_ (ἐπιστύλιον, _epistylium_): above this is the\r\n_frieze_ (ζωοφόρος, ζωφόρος, _zophorus_), in which the most ancient\r\norder, namely the Doric, shows, in its triglyphs, what were\r\noriginally the ends of the cross-beams: in the other orders these\r\nends are generally concealed, and the frieze forms a flat surface,\r\nwhich is frequently ornamented by figures in relief, whence its Greek\r\nname. Above the frieze projects the cornice (κορωνίς, _coronis_ or\r\n_corona_), forming a handsome finish to the entablature (for so these\r\nthree members taken together are called), and also, on the sides of\r\nthe building, serving to unite the ends of the rafters of the roof.\r\nThe triangular gable-end of the roof, above the entablature, is\r\ncalled the _pediment_. [FASTIGIUM.]--Columns in long rows were used\r\nin aquaeducts, and single pillars were fixed in harbours for mooring\r\nships.--Single columns were also erected to commemorate persons or\r\nevents. Among these, some of the most remarkable were the _columnae\r\nrostratae_, called by that name because three ship-beaks proceeded\r\nfrom each side of them, designed to record successful engagements at\r\nsea. The most important and celebrated of those which yet remain,\r\nis one erected in honour of the consul C. Duillius, on occasion of\r\nhis victory over the Carthaginian fleet, B.C. 261. Columns were also\r\nemployed to commemorate the dead. The column on the right hand in the\r\nlast woodcut exhibits that which the senate erected to the honour of\r\nthe Emperor Trajan. Similar columns were erected to the memory of\r\nmany of the Roman emperors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Columna Rostrata. Columna Trajana.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎLUMNĀRĬUM, a tax imposed in the time of Julius Caesar upon the\r\npillars that supported a house. The _Ostiarium_ was a similar tax.\r\n[OSTIARIUM.] The _columnarium_, levied by Metellus Scipio in Syria in\r\nB.C. 49-48, was a tax of a similar kind, but was simply an illegal\r\nmeans of extorting money from the provincials.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎLUS, a distaff. [FUSUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Greek Head-dresses. (From Ancient Vases.)\r\n\r\nThe left-hand figure on the top wears a κεκρύφαλος proper\r\n(_reticulum_). Of the two bottom figures, the one on the left-hand\r\nwears a μίτρα, and the one on the right a σάκκος.]\r\n\r\nCŎMA (κόμη, κουρά), the hair. (1) GREEK. In the earliest times the\r\nGreeks wore their hair long, and thus they are constantly called in\r\nHomer καρηκομόωντες Ἀχαιοί. The Spartan boys always had their hair\r\ncut quite short (ἐν χρῷ κείροντες); but as soon as they reached\r\nthe age of puberty (ἔφηβοι), they let it grow long. Before going\r\nto battle they combed and dressed it with especial care. It seems\r\nthat both Spartan men and women tied their hair in a knot over the\r\ncrown of the head. The custom of the Athenians was different. They\r\nwore their hair long in childhood, and cut it off when they reached\r\nthe age of puberty. The cutting off of the hair, which was always\r\ndone when a boy became an ἔφηβος, was a solemn act, attended with\r\nreligious ceremonies. A libation was first offered to Hercules,\r\nwhich was called οἰνιστήρια or οἰνιαστήρια, and the hair after being\r\ncut off was dedicated to some deity, usually a river-god. But when\r\nthe Athenians passed into the age of manhood, they again let their\r\nhair grow. In ancient times at Athens the hair was rolled up into\r\na kind of knot on the crown of the head, and fastened with golden\r\nclasps in the shape of grasshoppers. This fashion of wearing the\r\nhair was called κρωβύλος, and in the case of females κόρυμβος. The\r\nheads of females were frequently covered with a kind of band or a\r\ncoif of net-work. Of these coiffures one was called σφενδόνη, which\r\nwas a broad band across the forehead, sometimes made of metal, and\r\nsometimes of leather, adorned with gold. But the most common kind of\r\nhead-dress for females was called by the general name of κεκρύφαλος,\r\nand this was divided into the three species of κεκρύφαλος, σάκκος,\r\nand μίτρα. The κεκρύφαλος, in its narrower sense, was a caul or coif\r\nof net-work, corresponding to the Latin _reticulum_. These hair-nets\r\nwere frequently made of gold threads, sometimes of silk, or the\r\nElean byssus, and probably of other materials. The σάκκος and the\r\nμίτρα were, on the contrary, made of close materials. The σάκκος\r\ncovered the head entirely like a sack or bag; it was made of various\r\nmaterials, such as silk, byssus, and wool. The μίτρα was a broad band\r\nof cloth of different colours, which was wound round the hair, and\r\nwas worn in various ways. It was originally an Eastern head-dress,\r\nand may, therefore, be compared to the modern turban. The Roman\r\n_calautica_ or _calvatica_ is said by Servius to have been the same\r\nas the _mitra_, but in a passage in the Digest they are mentioned as\r\nif they were distinct.--With respect to the colour of the hair, black\r\nwas the most frequent, but _blonde_ (ξανθὴ κόμη) was the most prized.\r\nIn Homer, Achilles, Ulysses, and other heroes are represented with\r\nblonde hair. At a later time it seems to have been not unfrequent\r\nto dye hair, so as to make it either black or blonde, and this\r\nwas done by men as well as by women, especially when the hair was\r\ngrowing gray.--(2) ROMAN. Besides the generic _coma_ we also find\r\nthe following words signifying the hair: _capillus_, _caesaries_,\r\n_crines_, _cincinnus_, and _cirrus_, the two last words being used to\r\nsignify curled hair. In early times the Romans wore their hair long,\r\nand hence the Romans of the Augustan age designated their ancestors\r\n_intonsi_ and _capillati_. But after the introduction of barbers into\r\nItaly about B.C. 300, it became the practice to wear the hair short.\r\nThe women, too, originally dressed their hair with great simplicity,\r\nbut in the Augustan period a variety of different head-dresses came\r\ninto fashion. Sometimes these head-dresses were raised to a great\r\nheight by rows of false curls. So much attention did the Roman ladies\r\ndevote to the dressing of the hair, that they kept slaves especially\r\nfor this purpose, called _ornatrices_, and had them instructed by a\r\nmaster in the art. Most of the Greek head-dresses mentioned above\r\nwere also worn by the Roman ladies; but the _mitrae_ appear to\r\nhave been confined to prostitutes. One of the simplest modes of\r\nwearing the hair was allowing it to fall down in tresses behind, and\r\nonly confining it by a band encircling the head. [VITTA.] Another\r\nfavourite plan was platting the hair, and then fastening it behind\r\nwith a large pin. Blonde hair was as much prized by the Romans as by\r\nthe Greeks, and hence the Roman ladies used a kind of composition or\r\nwash to make it appear this colour (_spuma caustica_). False hair or\r\nwigs (φενάκη, πηνίκη, _galerus_) were worn both by Greeks and Romans.\r\nAmong both people likewise in ancient times the hair was cut close in\r\nmourning [FUNUS]; and among both the slaves had their hair cut close\r\nas a mark of servitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŌMISSĀTĬO (derived from κῶμος), the name of a drinking\r\nentertainment, which took place after the coena, from which, however,\r\nit must be distinguished. The comissatio was frequently prolonged to\r\na late hour at night, whence the verb _comissari_ means “to revel,”\r\nand the substantive _comissator_ a “reveller,” or “debauchee.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎMĬTĬA. This word is formed from _co_, _cum_, or _con_, and _ire_,\r\nand therefore _comitium_ is a place of meeting, and _comitia_ the\r\nmeeting itself, or the assembled people. In the Roman constitution\r\nthe comitia were the ordinary and legal meetings or assemblies of the\r\npeople, and distinct from the _contiones_ and _concilia_. All the\r\npowers of government were divided at Rome between the senate, the\r\nmagistrates, and the people in their assemblies. Properly speaking,\r\nthe people alone (the _populus_) was the real sovereign by whom the\r\npower was delegated to the magistrates and the senate. The sovereign\r\npeople or populus, however, was not the same at all times. In the\r\nearliest times of Rome the populus consisted of the patricians (or\r\npatres) only, the plebs and the clients forming no part of the\r\npopulus, but being without the pale of the state. The original\r\npopulus was divided into thirty _curiae_, and the assembly of these\r\ncuriae (the _comitia curiata_) was the only assembly in which the\r\npopulus was represented. A kind of amalgamation of the patricians\r\nand the plebs afterwards appeared in the comitia of the centuries,\r\ninstituted by king Servius Tullius, and henceforth the term populus\r\nwas applied to the united patricians and plebeians assembled in the\r\n_comitia centuriata_. But Servius had also made a local division\r\nof the whole Roman territory into thirty tribes, which held their\r\nmeetings in assemblies called _comitia tributa_, which, in the course\r\nof time, acquired the character of national assemblies, so that the\r\npeople thus assembled were likewise designated by the term populus.\r\n\r\nWe shall examine in order the nature, power, and business of each of\r\nthese different comitia. (1) COMITIA CURIATA consisted of the members\r\nof the thirty curiae, that is, the patricians, who formed exclusively\r\nthe populus in the early times. They were convened, in the kingly\r\nperiod, by the king himself, or by his tribunus celerum, and in the\r\nking’s absence by the praefectus urbi. After the death of a king the\r\ncomitia were held by the interrex. In the republican period, the\r\npresident was always one of the high patrician magistrates, viz. a\r\nconsul, praetor, or dictator. They were called together by lictors\r\nor heralds. The votes were given by curiae, each curia having one\r\ncollective vote; but within a curia each citizen belonging to it\r\nhad an independent vote, and the majority of the members of a curia\r\ndetermined the vote of the whole curia. The meeting was always held\r\nin the comitium. The comitia curiata did not possess much power in\r\nthe kingly period. They could only be called together when the king\r\n(or his representative) chose, and could only determine upon matters\r\nwhich the king submitted to them. The main points upon which the\r\npopulus had to decide were the election of the king, the passing of\r\nlaws, declarations of war, the capital punishment of Roman citizens,\r\nand, lastly, certain affairs of the curiae and gentes. The priestly\r\nofficers, such as the Curiones, Flamines Curiales, were likewise\r\neither elected by the curiae, or at least inaugurated by them. The\r\nright of finally deciding upon the life of Roman citizens (_judicia\r\nde capite civis Romani_) is said to have been given to the populus\r\nby king Tullus Hostilius. It must further be remarked, that when the\r\nking had been elected, the populus held a second meeting, in which he\r\nwas formally inducted into his new office. This formality was called\r\n_lex curiata de imperio_, whereby the king received his _imperium_,\r\ntogether with the right of holding the comitia. Down to the time of\r\nServius Tullius, the comitia curiata were the only popular assemblies\r\nof Rome, and remained of course in the undiminished possession of the\r\nrights above described; but the constitution of that king brought\r\nabout a great change, by transferring the principal rights which\r\nhad hitherto been enjoyed by the curiae to a new national assembly\r\nor the comitia centuriata. But while the patricians were obliged to\r\nshare their rights with the plebeians, they reserved for themselves\r\nthe very important right of sanctioning or rejecting any measure\r\nwhich had been passed by the centuries. The sanction of decrees\r\npassed by the centuries is often expressed by _patres auctores\r\nfiunt_, and down to the time of the Publilian law no decree of the\r\ncenturies could become law without this sanction. By the Publilian\r\nlaw (B.C. 339) it was enacted that the curiae should give their\r\nassent before the vote of the comitia centuriata; so that the veto\r\nof the curiae was thus virtually abolished. The comitia curiata thus\r\nbecame a mere formality, and, instead of the thirty curiae themselves\r\ngiving their votes, the ceremony was performed by thirty lictors.\r\nThe comitia of the curiae were also called COMITIA CALATA or “the\r\nsummoned comitia” (from _calare_, i.e. _vocare_), when summoned for\r\nthe purposes mentioned below:--1. On the calends it was proclaimed\r\nto the comitia calata on what day of the new month the nones fell,\r\nand perhaps also the ides as well as the nature of the other days,\r\nnamely, whether they were fasti or nefasti, comitiales, feriae,\r\n&c., because all these things were known in the early times to the\r\npontiffs exclusively. 2. The inauguration of the flamines, and after\r\nthe banishment of the kings, also that of the rex sacrorum. 3. The\r\n_testamenti factio_, or the making of a will. 4. The _detestatio\r\nsacrorum_, which was in all probability an act connected with the\r\ntestamenti factio, that is, a solemn declaration, by which the heir\r\nwas enjoined to undertake the sacra privata of the testator along\r\nwith the reception of his property. The comitia calata were summoned\r\nby the college of pontiffs, who also presided in them.\r\n\r\n(2) COMITIA CENTURIATA. The object of the legislation of Servius\r\nTullius was to unite the different elements of which the Roman\r\npeople consisted, into one great political body, in which power and\r\ninfluence were to be determined by property and age. The whole people\r\nwas conceived as an army (_exercitus_), and was therefore divided\r\ninto two parts, the cavalry (_equites_), and infantry (_pedites_).\r\nThe infantry was divided into five classes, or, as Dionysius has\r\nit, into six classes, for he regards the whole body of people,\r\nwhose property did not come up to the census of the fifth class,\r\nas a sixth. The class to which a citizen belonged determined the\r\n_tributum_, or war tax, he had to pay, as well as the kind of service\r\nhe had to perform in the army and the armour in which he had to\r\nserve. But for the purpose of voting in the comitia, each class was\r\nsubdivided into a number of centuries (_centuriae_, probably because\r\neach was conceived to contain 100 men, though the centuries may have\r\ngreatly differed in the number of men they contained). Hence the name\r\nof _Comitia Centuriata_. Each century was divided into the _seniores_\r\nand the _juniores_. Each century, further, was counted as one vote,\r\nso that a class had as many votes as it contained centuries. In\r\nlike manner, the equites were divided into a number of centuries or\r\nvotes. The two principal authorities on these subdivisions are Livy\r\nand Dionysius. The annexed table will show the census as well as the\r\nnumber of centuries or votes assigned to each class.\r\n\r\n        _According to Livy._                 _According to Dionysius._\r\n    I.

The latter number is the more probable, since\r\nLivy’s even number of 194 centuries would have rendered it impossible\r\nto obtain an absolute majority. In this manner all Roman citizens,\r\nwhether patricians or plebeians, who had property to a certain\r\namount, were privileged to take part and vote in the centuriata\r\ncomitia, and none were excluded except slaves, peregrini, women and\r\nthe aerarii. The juniores were all men from the age of seventeen to\r\nthat of forty-six, and the seniores all men from the age of forty-six\r\nupwards. The order of voting was arranged in such a manner, that if\r\nthe eighteen centuries of the equites and the eighty centuries of\r\nthe first class were agreed upon a measure, the question was decided\r\nat once, there being no need for calling upon the other classes to\r\nvote. Hence, although all Roman citizens appeared in these comitia\r\non a footing of equality, yet by far the greater power was thrown\r\ninto the hands of the wealthy.--As regards the functions of the\r\ncomitia centuriata, they were--(a.) _The election of magistrates._\r\nThe magistrates that were elected by the centuries are the consuls\r\n(whence the assembly is called _comitia consularia_), the praetors\r\n(hence _comitia praetoria_), the military tribunes with consular\r\npower, the censors, and the decemvirs. (b.) _Legislation._ The\r\nlegislative power of the centuries at first consisted in their\r\npassing or rejecting a measure which was brought before them by the\r\npresiding magistrate in the form of a senatus consultum, so that\r\nthe assembly had no right of originating any legislative measure,\r\nbut voted only upon such as were brought before them as resolutions\r\nof the senate. (c.) _The decision upon war_, on the ground of a\r\nsenatus consultum, likewise belonged to the centuries. Peace was\r\nconcluded by a mere senatus consultum, and without any co-operation\r\nof the people. (d.) _The highest judicial power._ The comitia\r\ncenturiata were in the first place the highest court of appeal, and\r\nin the second, they had to try all offences committed against the\r\nstate; hence, all cases of _perduellio_ and _majestas_: and no case\r\ninvolving the life of a Roman citizen could be decided by any other\r\ncourt. The sanction of the curiae to the measures of the centuriae\r\nhas been already explained.--The comitia centuriata could be held\r\nonly on _dies comitiales_ or _fasti_, on which it was lawful to\r\ntransact business with the people, and the number of such days in\r\nevery year was about 190; but on _dies nefasti_ (that is, _dies\r\nfesti_, _feriati_, comp. DIES), and, at first also on the nundinae,\r\nno comitia could be held, until in B.C. 287 the Hortensian law\r\nordained that the nundinae should be regarded as dies fasti.--The\r\nplace where the centuries met was the Campus Martius, which contained\r\nthe septa for the voters, a tabernaculum for the president, and the\r\nvilla publica for the augurs.--The president at the comitia was the\r\nsame magistrate who convoked them, and this right was a privilege of\r\nthe consuls, and, in their absence, of the praetors. An interrex and\r\ndictator also, or his representative, the magister equitum, might\r\nlikewise convene and preside at the comitia. One of the main duties\r\ndevolving upon the president, and which he had to perform before\r\nholding the comitia, was to consult the auspices (_auspicari_). When\r\nthe auspices were favourable, the people were called together, which\r\nwas done by three successive and distinct acts: the first was quite\r\na general invitation to come to the assembly (_inlicium_). At the\r\nsame time when this invitation was proclaimed _circum moeros_ or\r\n_de moeris_, a horn was blown, which being the more audible signal,\r\nis mentioned by some writers alone, and without the inlicium. When\r\nupon this signal the people assembled in irregular masses, there\r\nfollowed the second call by the accensus, or the call _ad contionem_\r\nor _conventionem_; that is, to a regular assembly, and the crowd\r\nthen separated, grouping themselves according to their classes and\r\nages. Hereupon the consul appeared, ordering the people to come _ad\r\ncomitia centuriata_; and led the whole _exercitus_--for, in these\r\ncomitia, the Roman people are always conceived as an exercitus--out\r\nof the city, to the Campus Martius.--It was customary from the\r\nearliest times for an armed force to occupy the Janiculum, when the\r\npeople were assembled in the Campus Martius, for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the city against any sudden attack of the neighbouring\r\npeople; and on the Janiculum a vexillum was hoisted during the whole\r\ntime that the assembly lasted. This custom continued to be observed\r\neven at the time when Rome had no longer anything to fear from the\r\nneighbouring tribes.--When the people were thus regularly assembled,\r\nthe business was commenced with a solemn sacrifice, and a prayer of\r\nthe president, who then took his seat on his tribunal. The president\r\nthen opened the business by explaining to the people the subject\r\nfor which they had been convened, and concluded his exposition with\r\nthe words, _velitis, jubeatis Quirites_, e.g. _bellum indici_, or\r\n_ut M. Tullio aqua igni interdictum sit_, or whatever the subject\r\nmight be. This formula was the standing one in all comitia, and the\r\nwhole exposition of the president was called _rogatio_. When the\r\ncomitia were assembled for the purpose of an election, the presiding\r\nmagistrate had to read out the names of the candidates, and might\r\nexercise his influence by recommending the one whom he thought most\r\nfit for the office in question. If the assembly had been convened\r\nfor the purpose of passing a legislative measure, the president\r\nusually recommended the proposal, or he might grant to others, if\r\nthey desired it, permission to speak about the measure, either in\r\nits favour or against it (_Contionem dare_). When the comitia acted\r\nas a court of justice, the president stated the crime, proposed the\r\npunishment to be inflicted upon the offender, and then allowed others\r\nto speak either in defence of the accused or against him. When the\r\nsubject brought before the assembly was sufficiently discussed, the\r\npresident called upon the people to prepare for voting by the words,\r\n_ite in suffragium, bene juvantibus diis_. He then passed the stream\r\nPetronia, and went to the _septa_.--Respecting the mode of voting,\r\nit is commonly supposed that the people were always polled by word\r\nof mouth, till the passing of the leges tabellariae about the middle\r\nof the second century before Christ, when the ballot by means of\r\ntabellae was introduced. [LEGES TABELLARIAE.] It appears, however,\r\nthat the popular assemblies voted by ballot, as well as by word of\r\nmouth, long before the passing of the leges tabellariae, but that\r\ninstead of using tabellae, they employed stones or pebbles (the Greek\r\nψῆφοι), and that each voter received two stones, one white and the\r\nother black, the former to be used in the approval and the latter in\r\nthe condemnation of a measure. The voting by word of mouth seems to\r\nhave been adopted in elections and trials, and the use of pebbles to\r\nhave been confined to the enactment and repeal of laws. Previous to\r\nthe leges tabellariae, the rogatores, who subsequently collected the\r\nwritten votes, stood at the entrance of the septa, and asked every\r\ncitizen for his vote, which was taken down, and used to determine\r\nthe vote of each century. After the introduction of the ballot, if\r\nthe business was the passing of a law, each citizen was provided\r\nwith two tabellae, one inscribed V. R. _i.e._ _Uti Rogas_, “I vote\r\nfor the law,” the other inscribed A. _i.e._ _Antiquo_, “I am for the\r\nold law.” If the business was the election of a magistrate, each\r\ncitizen was supplied with only one tablet, on which the names of the\r\ncandidates were written, or the initials of their names; the voter\r\nthen placed a mark (_punctum_) against the one for whom he voted,\r\nwhence _puncta_ are spoken of in the sense of votes. For further\r\nparticulars respecting the voting in the comitia, see DIRIBITORES\r\nand SITULA. In judicial assemblies every citizen was provided with\r\nthree tabellae, one of which was marked with A. _i.e._ _Absolvo_,\r\n“I acquit;” the second with C. _i.e._ _Condemno_, “I condemn;” and\r\nthe third with N. L. _i.e._ _Non Liquet_, “It is not clear to me.”\r\nThe first of these was called _Tabella absolutoria_ and the second\r\n_Tabella damnatoria_, and hence Cicero calls the former _litera\r\nsalutaris_, and the latter _litera tristis_.--There were in the\r\nCampus Martius septa or inclosures (whether they existed from the\r\nearliest times is unknown), into which one class of citizens was\r\nadmitted after another for the purpose of voting. The first that\r\nentered were the eighteen centuries of the equites, then followed\r\nthe first class and so on. It very rarely happened that the lowest\r\nclass was called upon to vote, as there was no necessity for it,\r\nunless the first class did not agree with the equites. After the time\r\nwhen the comitia of the centuries became amalgamated with those of\r\nthe tribes, a large space near the villa publica was surrounded with\r\nan enclosure, and divided into compartments for the several tribes.\r\nThe whole of this enclosure was called _ovile, septa, carceres_, or\r\n_cancelli_; and in later times a stone building, containing the whole\r\npeople, was erected; it was divided into compartments for the classes\r\nas well as the tribes and centuries; the access to these compartments\r\nwas formed by narrow passages called _pontes_ or _ponticuli_. On\r\nentering, the citizens received their tablets, and when they had\r\nconsulted within the enclosures, they passed out of them again by a\r\n_pons_ or _ponticulus_, at which they threw their vote into a chest\r\n(_cista_) which was watched by _rogatores_. Hereupon the _rogatores_\r\ncollected the tablets, and gave them to the _diribitores_, who\r\nclassified and counted the votes, and then handed them over to the\r\n_custodes_, who again checked them off by points marked on a tablet.\r\nThe order in which the centuries voted was determined in the Servian\r\nconstitution, in the manner described above; but after the union of\r\nthe centuries and tribes, the order was determined by lot; and this\r\nwas a matter of no slight importance, since it frequently happened\r\nthat the vote of the first determined the manner in which subsequent\r\nones voted. In the case of elections, the successful candidate was\r\nproclaimed twice, first by the praeco, and then by the president, and\r\nwithout this renuntiatio the election was not valid. After all the\r\nbusiness was done, the president pronounced a prayer, and dismissed\r\nthe assembly with the word _discedite_.--Cases are frequently\r\nmentioned in which the proceedings of the assembly were disturbed,\r\nso that it was necessary to defer the business till another day.\r\nThis occurred--1, when it was discovered that the auspices had been\r\nunfavourable, or when the gods manifested their displeasure by rain,\r\nthunder, or lightning; 2, when a tribune interceded; 3, when the sun\r\nset before the business was over, for it was a principle that the\r\nauspices were valid only for one day from sunrise to sunset; 4, when\r\na _morbus comitialis_ occurred, _i.e._ when one of the assembled\r\ncitizens was seized with an epileptic fit; 5, when the vexillum was\r\ntaken away from the Janiculum, this being a signal which all citizens\r\nhad to obey; 6, when any tumult or insurrection broke out in the city.\r\n\r\n(3) COMITIA TRIBUTA. These assemblies likewise were called into\r\nexistence by the constitution of Servius Tullius, who divided the\r\nRoman territory into thirty local tribes. It is a disputed question\r\nwhether the patricians were originally included in these tribes; but,\r\nwhether they were or not, it is certain, that by far the majority\r\nof the people in the tribes were plebeians, and that, consequently,\r\nthe character of these assemblies was essentially plebeian. After\r\nthe decemvirate, the patricians had certainly the right of voting in\r\nthe assemblies of the tribes, which were then also convened by the\r\nhigher magistrates. The assemblies of the tribes had originally only\r\na local power; they were intended to collect the tributum, and to\r\nfurnish the contingents for the army; they may further have discussed\r\nthe internal affairs of each tribe, such as the making or keeping\r\nup of roads, wells, and the like. But their influence gradually\r\nincreased, and they at length acquired the following powers:--1.\r\n_The election of the inferior magistrates_, whose office it was to\r\nprotect the commonalty or to superintend the affairs of the tribes.\r\nHence the tribunes of the plebs were elected in the comitia tributa.\r\nIn like manner, the aediles were elected by them, though the curule\r\naediles were elected at a different time from the plebeian aediles\r\nand under the presidency of a consul. At a still later time, the\r\nquaestors and tribunes of the soldiers, who had before been appointed\r\nby the consuls, were appointed in the assemblies of the tribes. The\r\nproconsuls to be sent into the provinces, and the prolongation of\r\nthe imperium for a magistrate who was already in a province, were\r\nlikewise points which were determined by the tribes in later times.\r\nThe inferior magistrates elected by the tribes are:--the triumviri\r\ncapitales, triumviri monetales, the curatores viarum, decemviri\r\nlitibus judicandis, tribuni aerarii, magistri vicorum et pagorum,\r\npraefecti annonae, duumviri navales, quinqueviri muris turribusque\r\nreficiendis, triumviri coloniae deducendae, triumviri, quatuorviri,\r\n&c., mensarii, and lastly, after the Domitian law, B.C. 104, also the\r\nmembers of colleges of priests. The pontifex maximus had been elected\r\nby the people from an earlier time. 2. _The legislative power_ of\r\nthe comitia tributa was at first very insignificant, for all they\r\ncould do was to make regulations concerning the local affairs of\r\nthe tribes. But after a time, when the tribes began to be the real\r\nrepresentatives of the people, matters affecting the whole people\r\nalso were brought before them by the tribunes, which, framed as\r\nresolutions, were laid before the senate, where they might either\r\nbe sanctioned or rejected. This practice of the tributa comitia\r\ngradually acquired for them the right of taking the initiative in\r\nany measure, or the right of originating measures, until, in B.C.\r\n449, this right was recognised and sanctioned by a law of L. Valerius\r\nPublicola and M. Horatius Barbatus. This law gave to the decrees\r\npassed by the tribes the power of a real _lex_, binding upon the\r\nwhole people, provided they obtained the sanction of the senate and\r\nthe populus, that is, the people assembled in the comitia curiata or\r\nin the comitia centuriata. In B.C. 339, the Publilian law enacted\r\n_ut plebiscita omnes Quirites tenerent_. This law was either a\r\nre-enactment of the one passed in B.C. 449, or contained a more\r\ndetailed specification of the cases in which plebiscita should be\r\nbinding upon the whole nation, or, lastly, it made their validity\r\nindependent of the sanction of other comitia, so that nothing would\r\nbe required except the assent of the senate. In B.C. 287, the\r\nHortensian law was passed, which seems to have been only a revival\r\nand a confirmation of the two preceding laws, for it was framed in\r\nalmost the same terms; but it may also be, that the Hortensian law\r\nmade the plebiscita independent of the sanction of the senate, so\r\nthat henceforth the comitia tributa were quite independent in their\r\nlegislative character. 3. _The judicial power_ of the comitia tributa\r\nwas much more limited than that of the comitia centuriata, inasmuch\r\nas they could take cognizance only of offences against the majesty of\r\nthe people, while all crimes committed against the state were brought\r\nbefore the centuries. Even patricians, when they had offended against\r\nthe commonalty or its members, were tried and fined by the tribes.\r\nThis again constitutes a difference between the judicial power of\r\nthe centuries and that of the tribes, for the former could inflict\r\ncapital punishment, but the latter only fines. The comitia tributa\r\nmight assemble either within or without the city, but not farther\r\nfrom it than 1000 paces, because the power of the tribunes did not\r\nextend farther. For elections the Campus Martius was usually chosen,\r\nbut sometimes also the forum, the Capitol, or the Circus Flaminius.\r\nThe presidents were commonly the tribunes, who were supported by the\r\naediles, and no matter could be brought before the tribes without\r\nthe knowledge and consent of the tribunes. As the comitia tributa,\r\nhowever, more and more assumed the character of national assemblies,\r\nthe higher magistrates also sometimes acted as presidents, though\r\nperhaps not without previously obtaining the permission of the\r\ntribunes. The preparations for the comitia tributa were less formal\r\nand solemn than for those of the centuries. In the case of elections,\r\nthe candidates had to give in their names, and the president\r\ncommunicated them to the people. When a legislative measure was to\r\nbe brought before the assembly, a tribune made the people acquainted\r\nwith it in _contiones_, and that on the three preceding nundines. The\r\nsame was the case when the people were to meet as a court of justice.\r\nThe auspicia were not consulted for the comitia of the tribes, but\r\nthe _spectio_ alone was sufficient, and the tribunes had the right\r\nof _obnuntiatio_. In the comitia the tribune who had been chosen to\r\npreside sat on the tribunal supported by his colleagues, and laid\r\nbefore the people the subject of the meeting, concluding with the\r\nwords _velitis, jubeatis Quirites_. The bill was never read by the\r\ntribune himself, but by a praeco, and then began the debates, in\r\nwhich persons might either oppose or recommend the measure, though\r\nprivate persons had to ask the tribunes for permission to speak.\r\nWhen the discussion was over the president called upon the people\r\n_ite in suffragium_, as at the comitia centuriata. They then formed\r\nthemselves into their tribes, which, like the centuries, ascertained\r\ntheir own votes in enclosures (septa). Which of the 35 tribes was\r\nto give its vote first, was determined by lot, and that tribe was\r\ncalled _praerogativa_ or _principium_ (the others were termed _jure\r\nvocatae_). The vote of the first tribe was given by some person of\r\ndistinction whose name was mentioned in the plebiscitum, if it was\r\nof a legislative nature. The manner of collecting the votes was, on\r\nthe whole, the same as in the comitia centuriata. The announcing of\r\nthe result of the votes was the _renuntiatio_. If it so happened that\r\ntwo candidates had the same number of votes, the question was decided\r\nby drawing lots. The circumstances which might cause the meeting to\r\nbreak up and defer its business till another day, are the same as\r\nthose which put an end to the comitia centuriata.\r\n\r\n(4) _The comitia centuriata mixed with the comitia tributa._--The\r\nServian constitution was retained unaltered so long as no great\r\nchange took place in the republic; but when the coinage and the\r\nstandard of property had become altered, when the constitution of\r\nthe army had been placed on a different footing, and, above all,\r\nwhen the plebeians began to be recognized as a great and essential\r\nelement in the Roman state, it must have been found inconvenient to\r\nleave to the equites and the first class so great a preponderance in\r\nthe comitia of the centuries, and it became necessary to secure more\r\npower and influence to the democratic element. A change, therefore,\r\ntook place, and the comitia centuriata became mixed with the comitia\r\ntributa; but neither the time nor the exact nature of this change\r\nis accurately ascertained. Some refer it to the censorship of C.\r\nFlaminius, B.C. 220, others to that of Q. Fabius and P. Decius,\r\nB.C. 304. But there is evidence that it must be assigned to even an\r\nearlier date than this, for the (tribus) praerogativa is mentioned\r\nas early as B.C. 396 in the election of the consular tribunes, where\r\nthe pure comitia tributa cannot be meant, and a centuria praerogativa\r\nis a thing unknown. With regard to the manner of the change, the\r\nmost probable opinion is, that the citizens of each tribe were\r\ndivided into five property classes, each consisting of seniores and\r\njuniores, so that each of the 35 tribes contained ten centuries,\r\nand all the tribes together 350 centuries. According to this new\r\narrangement, the five ancient classes, divided into seniores and\r\njuniores, continued to exist as before, but henceforth they were\r\nmost closely united with the tribes, whereas before the tribes had\r\nbeen mere local divisions and entirely independent of property. The\r\nunion now effected was that the classes became subdivisions of the\r\ntribes, and that accordingly centuries occur both in the classes\r\nand in the tribes. Each tribe contained ten centuries, two of the\r\nfirst class (one of the seniores and one of the juniores), two of\r\nthe second (likewise seniores and juniores), two of the third, two\r\nof the fourth, and two of the fifth class. The equites were likewise\r\ndivided according to tribes and centuries, and they seem to have\r\nvoted with the first class, and to have been in fact included in it,\r\nso as to be called centuries of the first class. The centuries of\r\nthe cornicines, tubicines and fabri, which are no longer mentioned,\r\nprobably ceased to exist as distinct centuries. The voting by tribes\r\ncan hardly be conceived, except in those cases in which the ten\r\ncenturies of every tribe were unanimous; this may have been the\r\ncase very often, and when it was so, the tribus praerogativa was\r\ncertainly the tribe chosen by lot to give its unanimous vote first.\r\nBut if there was any difference of opinion among the centuries making\r\nup a tribe, the true majority could only be ascertained by choosing\r\nby lot one of the 70 centuriae of the first class to give its vote\r\nfirst, or rather it was decided by lot from which tribe the two\r\ncenturies of the first class were to be taken to give their vote\r\nfirst. (Hence the plural _praerogativae_.) The tribe, moreover, to\r\nwhich those centuries belonged which voted first, was itself likewise\r\ncalled tribus praerogativa. Of the two centuries, again, that of\r\nseniores gave its vote before the juniores, and in the documents\r\nboth were called by the name of their tribe, as _Galeria juniorum_,\r\n_i.e._ the juniores of the first class in the tribus Galeria,\r\n_Aniensis juniorum, Veturia juniorum_. As soon as the praerogativa\r\nhad voted, the renuntiatio took place, and the remaining centuries\r\nthen deliberated whether they should vote the same way or not. When\r\nthis was done all the centuries of the first tribe proceeded to vote\r\nat once, for there would not have been time for the 350 centuries\r\nto vote one after another, as was done by the 193 centuries in\r\nthe comitia centuriata.--These comitia of the centuries combined\r\nwith the tribes were far more democratical than the comitia of the\r\ncenturies; they continued to be held, and preserved their power along\r\nwith the comitia tributa, even after the latter had acquired their\r\nsupreme importance in the republic. During the time of the moral and\r\npolitical corruption of the Romans, the latter appear to have been\r\nchiefly attended by the populace, which was guided by the tribunes,\r\nand the wealthier and more respectable citizens had little influence\r\nin them. When the libertini and all the Italians were incorporated\r\nin the old thirty-five tribes, and when the political corruption had\r\nreached its height, no trace of the sedate and moderate character was\r\nleft by which the comitia tributa had been distinguished in former\r\ntimes. Under Augustus the comitia still sanctioned new laws and\r\nelected magistrates, but their whole proceedings were a mere farce,\r\nfor they could not venture to elect any other persons than those\r\nrecommended by the emperor. Tiberius deprived the people even of this\r\nshadow of their former power, and conferred the power of election\r\nupon the senate. When the elections were made by the senate the\r\nresult was announced to the people assembled as comitia centuriata\r\nor tributa. Legislation was taken away from the comitia entirely,\r\nand was completely in the hands of the senate and the emperor. From\r\nthis time the comitia may be said to have ceased to exist, as all the\r\nsovereign power formerly possessed by the people was conferred upon\r\nthe emperor by the lex regia. [LEX REGIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMĔĀTUS, a furlough, or leave of absence from the army for a\r\ncertain time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTĀRĬUS or COMMENTĀRĬUM, a book of memoirs or memorandum-book,\r\nwhence the expression _Caesaris Commentarii_. It is also used for a\r\nlawyer’s brief, the notes of a speech, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCĬUM. [CIVITAS (ROMAN).]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŌMOEDĬA (κωμῳδία), comedy. (1) GREEK. Comedy took its rise at the\r\nvintage festivals of Dionysus. It originated with those who led\r\noff the phallic songs of the band of revellers (κῶμος), who at the\r\nvintage festivals of Dionysus gave expression to the feelings of\r\nexuberant joy and merriment which were regarded as appropriate to\r\nthe occasion, by parading about, partly on foot, partly in waggons,\r\nwith the symbol of the productive powers of nature, singing a wild,\r\njovial song in honour of Dionysus and his companions. These songs\r\nwere commonly interspersed with, or followed by petulant, extemporal\r\nwitticisms with which the revellers assailed the bystanders. This\r\norigin of comedy is indicated by the name κωμῳδία, which undoubtedly\r\nmeans “the song of the κῶμος,” though it has sometimes been derived\r\nfrom κώμη, as if the meaning were “a village song.” It was among the\r\nDorians that comedy first assumed any thing of a regular shape. The\r\nMegarians, both in the mother country and in Sicily, claimed to be\r\nconsidered as its originators, and so far as the comedy of Athens\r\nis concerned, the claim of the former appears well founded. Among\r\nthe Athenians the first attempts at comedy were made at Icaria by\r\nSusarion, a native of Megara, about B.C. 578. Susarion no doubt\r\nsubstituted for the more ancient improvisations of the chorus and\r\nits leader premeditated compositions. There would seem also to have\r\nbeen some kind of poetical contest, for we learn that the prize for\r\nthe successful poet was a basket of figs and a jar of wine. It was\r\nalso the practice of those who took part in the comus to smear their\r\nfaces with wine-lees, either to prevent their features from being\r\nrecognised, or to give themselves a more grotesque appearance. Hence\r\ncomedy came to be called τρυγῳδία, or lee-song. Others connected\r\nthe name with the circumstance of a jar of new wine (τρύξ) being\r\nthe prize for the successful poet. It was, however, in Sicily, that\r\ncomedy was earliest brought to something like perfection. Epicharmus\r\nwas the first writer who gave it a new form, and introduced a\r\nregular plot. In his efforts he appears to have been associated\r\nwith Phormis, a somewhat older contemporary. The Megarians in\r\nSicily claimed the honour of the invention of comedy, on account of\r\nEpicharmus having lived in Megara before he went to Syracuse. In\r\nAttica, the first comic poet of any importance whom we hear of after\r\nSusarion is Chionides, who is said to have brought out plays in B.C.\r\n488. Euetes, Euxenides, and Myllus were probably contemporaries\r\nof Chionides; he was followed by Magnes and Ecphantides. Their\r\ncompositions, however, seem to have been little but the reproduction\r\nof the old Megaric farce of Susarion, differing, no doubt, in\r\nform, by the introduction of an actor or actors, separate from the\r\nchorus, in imitation of the improvements that had been made in\r\ntragedy.--That branch of the Attic drama which was called the _Old\r\nComedy_, begins properly with Cratinus, who was to comedy very much\r\nwhat Aeschylus was to tragedy. The old comedy has been described as\r\nthe comedy of caricature, and such indeed it was, but it was also a\r\ngreat deal more. As it appeared in the hands of its great masters\r\nCratinus, Hermippus, Eupolis, and especially Aristophanes, its main\r\ncharacteristic was that it was throughout _political_. Everything\r\nthat bore upon the political or social interests of the Athenians\r\nfurnished materials for it. The old Attic comedy lasted from Ol. 80\r\nto Ol. 94 (B.C. 458-404). From Cratinus to Theopompus there were\r\nforty-one poets, fourteen of whom preceded Aristophanes. The later\r\npieces of Aristophanes belong to the Middle rather than to the Old\r\nComedy. The chorus in a comedy consisted of twenty-four. [CHORUS.]\r\nThe dance of the chorus was the κόρδαξ, the movements of which were\r\ncapricious and licentious, consisting partly in a reeling to and\r\nfro, in imitation of a drunken man, and in various unseemly and\r\nimmodest gestures. Comedies have choric songs, but no στάσιμα, or\r\nsongs between acts. The most important of the choral parts was the\r\nParabasis, when the actors having left the stage, the chorus, which\r\nwas ordinarily divided into four rows, containing six each, and was\r\nturned towards the stage, turned round, and advancing towards the\r\nspectators delivered an address to them in the name of the poet,\r\neither on public topics of general interest, or on matters which\r\nconcerned the poet personally, criticising his rivals and calling\r\nattention to his merits; the address having nothing whatever to\r\ndo with the action of the play. The parabasis was not universally\r\nintroduced: three plays of Aristophanes, the Ecclesiazusae,\r\nLysistrata, and Plutus, have none. As the old Attic comedy was the\r\noffspring of the political and social vigour and freedom of the age\r\nduring which it flourished, it naturally declined and ceased with the\r\ndecline and overthrow of the freedom and vigour which were necessary\r\nfor its development.--It was replaced by a comedy of a somewhat\r\ndifferent style, which was known as the _Middle Comedy_, the age of\r\nwhich lasted from the end of the Peloponnesian war to the overthrow\r\nof liberty by Philip of Macedon. (Ol. 94-110.) The comedy of this\r\nperiod found its materials in satirizing classes of people instead of\r\nindividuals, in criticising the systems and merits of philosophers\r\nand literary men, and in parodies of the compositions of living and\r\nearlier poets, and travesties of mythological subjects. It formed\r\na transition from the old to the new comedy, and approximated to\r\nthe latter in the greater attention to the construction of plots\r\nwhich seem frequently to have been founded on amorous intrigues,\r\nand in the absence of that wild grotesqueness which marked the\r\nold comedy. As regards its external form, the plays of the middle\r\ncomedy, generally speaking, had neither parabasis nor chorus. The\r\nmost celebrated authors of the middle comedy were Antiphanes and\r\nAlexis.--The _New Comedy_ was a further development of the last\r\nmentioned kind. It answered as nearly as may be to the modern\r\ncomedy of manners or character. Dropping for the most part personal\r\nallusions, caricature, ridicule, and parody, which, in a more general\r\nform than in the old comedy, had maintained their ground in the\r\nmiddle comedy, the poets of the new comedy made it their business\r\nto reproduce in a generalized form a picture of the every-day life\r\nof those by whom they were surrounded. There were various standing\r\ncharacters which found a place in most plays, such as we find in the\r\nplays of Plautus and Terence, the _leno perjurus_, _amator fervidus_,\r\n_servulus callidus_, _amica illudens_, _sodalis opitulator_, _miles\r\nproeliator_, _parasitus edax_, _parentes tenaces_, _meretrices\r\nprocaces_. In the new comedy there was no chorus. It flourished from\r\nabout B.C. 340 to B.C. 260. The poets of the new comedy amounted to\r\n64 in number. The most distinguished was Menander.--(2) ROMAN.--The\r\naccounts of the early stages of comic poetry among the Romans are\r\nscanty. Scenic entertainments were introduced at Rome in B.C. 363\r\nfrom Etruria, where it would seem they were a familiar amusement.\r\nTuscan players (_ludiones_), who were fetched from Etruria, exhibited\r\na sort of pantomimic dance to the music of a flute, without any\r\nsong accompanying their dance, and without regular dramatic\r\ngesticulation. The amusement became popular, and was imitated by the\r\nyoung Romans, who improved upon the original entertainment by uniting\r\nwith it extemporaneous mutual raillery, composed in a rude irregular\r\nmeasure, a species of diversion which had been long known among the\r\nRomans at their agrarian festivals under the name of _Fescennina_\r\n[FESCENNINA]. It was 123 years after the first introduction of\r\nthese scenic performances before the improvement was introduced of\r\nhaving a regular plot. This advance was made by Livius Andronicus,\r\na native of Magna Graecia, in B.C. 240. His pieces, which were both\r\ntragedies and comedies, were merely adaptations of Greek dramas.\r\nThe representation of regular plays of this sort was now left to\r\nthose who were histriones by profession, and who were very commonly\r\neither foreigners or slaves; the free-born youth of Rome confined\r\ntheir own scenic performances to the older, irregular farces, which\r\nlong maintained their ground, and were subsequently called _exodia_.\r\n[EXODIA; SATURA.] Livius, as was common at that time, was himself an\r\nactor in his own pieces. The first imitator of the dramatic works\r\nof Livius Andronicus was Cn. Naevius, a native of Campania. He\r\ncomposed both tragedies and comedies, which were either translations\r\nor imitations of those of Greek writers. The most distinguished\r\nsuccessors of Naevius were Plautus, who chiefly imitated Epicharmus,\r\nand Terence, whose materials were drawn mostly from Menander,\r\nDiphilus, Philemon, and Apollodorus. The comedy of the Romans was\r\nthroughout but an imitation of that of the Greeks, and chiefly of\r\nthe new comedy. Where the characters were ostensibly Greek, and the\r\nscene laid in Athens or some other Greek town, the comedies were\r\ntermed _palliatae_. All the comedies of Terence and Plautus belong to\r\nthis class. When the story and characters were Roman, the plays were\r\ncalled _togatae_. But the fabulae togatae were in fact little else\r\nthan Greek comedies clothed in a Latin dress.\r\n\r\nThe togatae were divided into two classes, the _trabeatae_ and\r\n_tabernariae_, according as the subject was taken from high or from\r\nlow life. In the comediae palliatae, the costume of the ordinary\r\nactors was the Greek pallium. The plays which bore the name of\r\n_praetextatae_, were not so much tragedies as historical plays. It\r\nis a mistake to represent them as comedies. There was a species\r\nof tragi-comedy, named from the poet who introduced that style\r\n_Rhinthonica_. A tragedy the argument of which was Greek was termed\r\n_crepidata_. The mimes are sometimes classed with the Latin comedies.\r\n[MIMUS.] The mimes differed from the comedies in little more than\r\nthe predominance of the mimic representation over the dialogue. Latin\r\ncomedies had no chorus, any more than the dramas of the new comedy,\r\nof which they were for the most part imitations. Like them, too, they\r\nwere introduced by a prologue, which answered some of the purposes\r\nof the parabasis of the old comedy, so far as bespeaking the good\r\nwill of the spectators, and defending the poet against his rivals and\r\nenemies. It also communicated so much information as was necessary to\r\nunderstand the story of the play. The prologue was commonly spoken\r\nby one of the players, or, perhaps, by the manager of the troop.\r\nRespecting the _Atellanae fabulae_ see that article.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPĬTĀLĬA, also called LŪDI COMPĬTĀLĬCĬI, a festival celebrated\r\nonce a year in honour of the lares compitales, to whom sacrifices\r\nwere offered at the places where two or more ways met. In the time\r\nof Augustus, the ludi compitalicii had gone out of fashion, but were\r\nrestored by him. The compitalia belonged to the _feriae conceptivae_,\r\nthat is, festivals which were celebrated on days appointed annually\r\nby the magistrates or priests. The exact day on which this festival\r\nwas celebrated appears to have varied, though it was always in the\r\nwinter, generally at the beginning of January.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLŪVĬUM. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCĬLĬUM generally has the same meaning as _conventus_ or\r\n_conventio_, but the technical import of concilium in the Roman\r\nconstitution was an assembly of a _portion_ of the people as\r\ndistinct from the general assemblies or comitia. Accordingly, as\r\nthe comitia tributa embraced only a portion of the Roman people,\r\nviz. the plebeians, these comitia are often designated by the term\r\n_concilia plebis_. Concilium is also used by Latin writers to denote\r\nthe assemblies or meetings of confederate towns or nations, at which\r\neither their deputies alone or any of the citizens met who had time\r\nand inclination, and thus formed a representative assembly. Such an\r\nassembly or diet is commonly designated as _commune concilium_, or τὸ\r\nκοινόν, e.g. _Achaeorum_, _Aetolorum_, _Boeotorum_, _Macedoniae_, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFARRĔĀTĬO. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGĬĀRĬUM (_scil. vas_, from _congius_), a vessel containing a\r\n_congius_. [CONGIUS.] In the early times of the Roman republic the\r\n_congius_ was the usual measure of oil or wine which was, on certain\r\noccasions, distributed among the people; and thus _congiarium_\r\nbecame a name for liberal donations to the people, in general,\r\nwhether consisting of oil, wine, corn, money, or other things, while\r\ndonations made to the soldiers were called _donativa_, though they\r\nwere sometimes also termed _congiaria_. Many coins of the Roman\r\nemperors were struck in commemoration of such congiaria. _Congiarium_\r\nwas, moreover, occasionally used simply to designate a present or a\r\npension given by a person of high rank, or a prince, to his friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Congiarium. (Coin of Trajan.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGĬUS, a Roman liquid measure, which contained six sextarii, or the\r\neighth part of the amphora (nearly six pints Eng.) It was equal to\r\nthe larger _chous_ of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNUBĬUM. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŌNŌPĒUM (κωνωπεῖον), a gnat or musquito-curtain, _i.e._ a covering\r\nmade to be expanded over beds and couches to keep away gnats and\r\nother flying insects, so called from κώνωψ, a gnat. _Conopeum_ is the\r\norigin of the English word _canopy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONQUĪSĪTŌRES, persons employed to go about the country and impress\r\nsoldiers, when there was a difficulty in completing a levy. Sometimes\r\ncommissioners were appointed by a decree of the senate for the\r\npurpose of making a conquisitio.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSANGUĬNĔI. [COGNATI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSĔCRĀTĬO. [APOTHEOSIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSĬLĬUM. [CONVENTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUĀLĬA, a festival, with games, celebrated by the Romans,\r\naccording to Ovid and others, in honour of Consus, the god of secret\r\ndeliberations, or, according to Livy, of Neptunus Equestris. Some\r\nwriters, however, say that Neptunus Equestris and Consus were only\r\ndifferent names for one and the same deity. It was solemnised every\r\nyear in the circus, by the symbolical ceremony of uncovering an altar\r\ndedicated to the god, which was buried in the earth. For Romulus,\r\nwho was considered as the founder of the festival, was said to\r\nhave discovered an altar in the earth on that spot. The solemnity\r\ntook place on the 21st of August with horse and chariot races, and\r\nlibations were poured into the flames which consumed the sacrifices.\r\nDuring these festive games horses and mules were not allowed to do\r\nany work, and were adorned with garlands of flowers. It was at their\r\nfirst celebration that, according to the ancient legend, the Sabine\r\nmaidens were carried off.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUL (ὕπατος), the title of the two chief officers or magistrates\r\nof the Roman republic. The word is probably composed of _con_ and\r\n_sul_, which contains the same root as the verb _salio_, so that\r\nconsules signifies “those who come together,” just as _praesul_\r\nmeans “one who goes before,” and _exsul_, “one who goes out.” The\r\nconsulship is said to have been instituted upon the expulsion of\r\nthe kings in B.C. 509, when the kingly power was transferred to\r\ntwo magistrates, whose office lasted only for one year, that it\r\nmight not degenerate into tyranny by being vested longer in the\r\nsame persons; and for the same reason two were appointed instead\r\nof one king, as neither could undertake anything unless it was\r\nsanctioned and approved by his colleague. Their original title was\r\n_praetores_, or commanders of the armies, but this was changed into\r\nthat of _consules_ in B.C. 449, and the latter title remained in\r\nuse until the latest periods of the Roman empire.--The consuls were\r\nat first elected from the patricians exclusively. Their office was\r\nsuspended in B.C. 451, and its functions were performed by ten high\r\ncommissioners (_decemviri_), appointed to frame a code of laws. On\r\nthe re-establishment of the consulship in B.C. 449, the tribunes\r\nproposed that one of the consuls should be chosen from the plebeians,\r\nbut this was strenuously resisted by the patricians, and a compromise\r\neffected by suspending the consular office, and creating in its stead\r\nmilitary tribunes (_tribuni militum_) with consular power, who might\r\nbe elected indifferently both from the patricians and plebeians.\r\nThey were first appointed in B.C. 444. The plebeians, however, were\r\nnot satisfied with this concession, and still endeavoured to attain\r\nthe higher dignity of the consulship. At length, after a serious and\r\nlong-protracted struggle between the two orders, it was enacted by\r\nthe Licinian law, in B.C. 367, that henceforth the consulship should\r\nbe divided between the patricians and plebeians, and that one of the\r\nconsuls should always be a plebeian. Accordingly, in B.C. 366 L.\r\nSextius was elected the first plebeian consul. This law, however,\r\nwas not always observed, and it still frequently happened that both\r\nconsuls were patricians, until, in later times, when the difference\r\nbetween the two orders had entirely ceased, and the plebeians were\r\non a footing of perfect equality with the patricians, the consuls\r\nwere elected from both orders indiscriminately.--During the later\r\nperiods of the republic it was customary for persons to pass through\r\nseveral subordinate magistracies before they were elected consuls,\r\nthough this rule was departed from in many particular cases. The age\r\nat which a person was eligible to the consulship was fixed in B.C.\r\n180, by the lex annalis [LEX ANNALIS], at 43.--The election of the\r\nconsuls always took place in the comitia of the centuries, some time\r\nbefore the expiration of the official year of the actual consuls, and\r\nthe election was conducted either by the actual consuls themselves,\r\nor by an interrex or a dictator, and the persons elected, until they\r\nentered upon their office, were called _consules designati_. While\r\nthey were _designati_, they were in reality no more than private\r\npersons, but still they might exercise considerable influence upon\r\npublic affairs, for in the senate they were asked for their opinion\r\nfirst. If they had been guilty of any illegal act, either before or\r\nduring their election, such as bribery (_ambitus_), they were liable\r\nto prosecution, and the election might be declared void.--The time\r\nat which the old consuls laid down their office and the consules\r\ndesignati entered upon theirs, differed at different times. The\r\nfirst consuls are said to have entered upon their office in October,\r\nthen we find mention of the 1st of August, of the ides of December,\r\nthe 1st of July, and very frequently of the ides of March, until,\r\nin B.C. 153, it became an established rule for the consuls to enter\r\nupon their duties on the 1st of January; and this custom remained\r\ndown to the end of the republic. On that day the senators, equites,\r\nand citizens of all classes conducted in a procession (_deductio_\r\nor _processus consularis_) the new magistrates from their residence\r\nto the capitol, where, if the auspices were favourable, the consuls\r\noffered up sacrifices, and were inaugurated. From thence the\r\nprocession went to the curia, where the senate assembled, and where\r\nthe consuls returned thanks for their election. There they might\r\nalso speak on any subject that was of importance to the republic,\r\nsuch as peace and war, the distribution of provinces, the general\r\ncondition of the state, the _feriae Latinae_, and the like. During\r\nthe first five days of their office they had to convoke a _contio_,\r\nand publicly to take a solemn oath, by which, in the earliest times,\r\nthey pledged themselves not to allow any one to assume regal power\r\nat Rome, but afterwards only to maintain the laws of the republic\r\n(_in leges jurare_). On the expiration of their office they had to\r\ntake another oath, stating that they had faithfully obeyed the laws,\r\nand not done anything against the constitution. The new consuls\r\non entering upon their office usually invited their friends to a\r\nbanquet. When a consul died during his year of office, his colleague\r\nimmediately convoked the comitia to elect a new one. A consul thus\r\nelected to fill a vacancy was called _consul suffectus_, but his\r\npowers were not equal to those of an ordinary consul, for he could\r\nnot preside at the elections of other magistrates, not even in the\r\ncase of the death of his colleague. In the latter case, as well as\r\nwhen the consuls were prevented by illness or other circumstances,\r\nthe comitia were held by an interrex or a dictator.--The outward\r\ndistinctions of the consuls were, with few exceptions, the same\r\nas those which had formerly belonged to the kings. The principal\r\ndistinction was the twelve lictors with the _fasces_, who preceded\r\nthe consuls; but the axes did not appear in the fasces within the\r\ncity. This outward sign of their power was taken by the consuls in\r\nturn every month, and while one consul was preceded by the twelve\r\nlictors with their fasces, the other was during the same month\r\npreceded by an _accensus_, and followed by the lictors; and the\r\none was called during that month _consul major_, and the other\r\n_consul minor_. Other distinctions of the consuls were the curule\r\nchair (_sella curulis_), and the toga with the purple hem (_toga\r\npraetexta_). The ivory sceptre (_scipio_ or _sceptrum_) and purple\r\ntoga were not distinctions of the consuls in general, but only when\r\nthey celebrated a triumph. Under the empire a consul was sometimes\r\ndistinguished by the senate with a sceptre bearing an eagle on the\r\ntop, but his regular ensigns consisted of the _toga picta_, the\r\n_trabea_, and the fasces, both within and without the city.--The\r\nconsuls were the highest ordinary magistrates at Rome. Their power\r\nwas at first quite equal to that of the kings, except that it was\r\nlimited to one year, and that the office of high priest, which had\r\nbeen vested in the king, was at the very beginning detached from the\r\nconsulship, and given to the _rex sacrorum_ or _rex sacrificulus_.\r\nYet the _auspicia majora_ continued to belong to the consuls. This\r\nregal power of the consuls, however, was gradually curtailed by\r\nvarious laws, especially by the institution of the tribunes of the\r\nplebs, whose province it was to protect the plebeians against the\r\nunjust or oppressive commands of the patrician magistrates. Nay,\r\nin the course of time, whole branches of the consular power were\r\ndetached from it; the reason for which was, that, as the patricians\r\nwere compelled to allow the plebeians a share in the highest\r\nmagistracy, they stripped it of as much of its original power as\r\nthey could, and reserved these detached portions for themselves.\r\nIn this manner the censorship was detached from the consulship in\r\nB.C. 443, and the praetorship in B.C. 367. But notwithstanding\r\nall this, the consuls remained the highest magistrates, and all\r\nother magistrates, except the tribunes of the plebs, were obliged\r\nto obey their commands, and show them great outward respect. The\r\nfunctions of the consuls during the time of the republic may be\r\nconveniently described under the following heads:--1. They were in\r\nall civil matters the heads of the state, being invested with the\r\nimperium, which emanated from the sovereign people, and which they\r\nheld during the time of their office. In this capacity they had the\r\nright of convoking both the senate and the assembly of the people;\r\nthey presided in each (in the comitia of the curies as well as in\r\nthose of the centuries), and they took care that the resolutions\r\nof the senate and people were carried into effect. They might also\r\nconvoke _contiones_, whenever they thought it necessary. In the\r\nsenate they conducted the discussions, and put the questions to the\r\nvote, thus exercising the greatest influence upon all matters which\r\nwere brought before the senate either by themselves or by others.\r\nWhen a decree was passed by the senate, the consuls were usually\r\ncommissioned to see that it was carried into effect; though there are\r\nalso instances of the consuls opposing a decree of the senate. 2.\r\nThe supreme command of the armies belonged to the consuls alone by\r\nvirtue of their imperium. Accordingly, when a war was decreed, they\r\nwere ordered by a senatus consultum to levy the troops, whose number\r\nwas determined by the senate, and they appointed most of the other\r\nmilitary officers. While at the head of their armies they had full\r\npower of life and death over their soldiers, who, on their enrolment,\r\nhad to take an oath (_sacramentum_) to be faithful and obedient to\r\nthe commands of the consuls. When the consuls had entered upon their\r\noffice, the senate assigned them their provinces, that is, their\r\nspheres of action, and the consuls either settled between themselves\r\nwhich province each was to have, or, which was more common, they drew\r\nlots. Usually one consul remained at Rome, while the other went out\r\nat the head of the army: sometimes both left the city, and carried\r\non war in different quarters; and sometimes, when the danger was\r\nvery pressing, both consuls commanded the armies against one and\r\nthe same enemy. If it was deemed advisable, the imperium of one or\r\nof both consuls was prolonged for the particular province in which\r\nthey were engaged, in which case they had the title of proconsuls\r\n[PROCONSUL], and their successors either remained at Rome, or were\r\nengaged in other quarters. During the latter period of the republic\r\nthe consuls remained at Rome during the time of their office, and\r\non its expiration they had a foreign province (in the real sense\r\nof the word) assigned to them, where they undertook either the\r\npeaceful administration, or carried on war against internal or\r\nexternal enemies. While in their provinces, both the consuls and\r\nproconsuls had the power of life and death over the provincials, for\r\nthey were looked upon there as the chief military commanders; and\r\nthe provincials, being _peregrini_, did not enjoy the privileges\r\nof Roman citizens. 3. The supreme jurisdiction was part of the\r\nconsular imperium, and as such vested in the consuls so long as\r\nthere were no praetors. In civil cases they administered justice\r\nto the patricians as well as plebeians, either acting themselves\r\nas _judices_, or appointing others as _judices_ and _arbitri_. In\r\ncriminal cases there appears from early times to have been this\r\ndifference: that patricians charged with capital offences were tried\r\nby the curies, while the plebeians came under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe consuls, whose power, however, was in this case rather limited,\r\npartly by the intercession of the tribunes of the people, and partly\r\nby the right of appeal (_provocatio_) from the sentence of the\r\nconsuls. The consuls might, further, summon any citizen before their\r\ntribunal, and, in case of disobedience, seize him (_prendere_),\r\nand fine him up to a certain amount. After the institution of the\r\npraetorship, the consuls no longer possessed any regular ordinary\r\njurisdiction; and whenever they exercised it, it was an exception\r\nto the general custom, and only by a special command of the senate.\r\n4. Previous to the institution of the censorship the consuls had to\r\nperform all the functions which afterwards belonged to the censors:\r\nthey were accordingly the highest officers of finance, held the\r\ncensus, drew up the lists of the senators, equites, &c. After the\r\nestablishment of the censorship they still retained the general\r\nsuperintendence of the public economy, inasmuch as they had the\r\nkeys of the _aerarium_, and as the quaestors or paymasters were\r\ndependent on them. But still in the management of the finances the\r\nconsuls were at all times under the control of the senate. 5. In all\r\nrelations with foreign states the consuls were the representatives\r\nof the Roman republic. Hence they might conclude peace or treaties\r\nwith foreign nations, which had, however, to be sanctioned by the\r\nsenate and people at Rome; and unless this sanction was obtained a\r\ntreaty was void. They received foreign ambassadors, and introduced\r\nthem into the senate, and in short all negotiations with foreign\r\nprinces or nations passed through their hands. 6. In matters\r\nconnected with their own official functions, the consuls, like all\r\nother magistrates, had the power of issuing proclamations or orders\r\n(_edicta_), which might be binding either for the occasion only, or\r\nremain in force permanently.--Although the consular power had been\r\ngradually diminished, it was in cases of imminent danger restored to\r\nits original and full extent, by a decree of the senate calling upon\r\nthe consuls _videant ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat_. In such\r\ncases the consuls received sovereign power, but they were responsible\r\nfor the manner in which they had exercised it.--It has already been\r\nobserved, that to avoid collision and confusion, the two consuls did\r\nnot possess the same power at the same time, but that each had the\r\nimperium every other month. The one who possessed it, as the _consul\r\nmajor_, exercised all the rights of the office, though he always\r\nconsulted his colleague. In the earliest times it was customary for\r\nthe elder of the two consuls to take the imperium first, afterwards\r\nthe one who had had the greater number of votes at the election, and\r\nhad therefore been proclaimed (_renuntiare_) first. In the time of\r\nAugustus it was enacted that the consul who had most children should\r\ntake precedence of the other; and some distinction of rank continued\r\nto be observed down to the latest times of the empire.--Towards the\r\nend of the republic the consulship lost its power and importance. The\r\nfirst severe blow it received was from Julius Caesar, the dictator,\r\nfor he received the consulship in addition to his dictatorship, or\r\nhe arbitrarily ordered others to be elected, who were mere nominal\r\nofficers, and were allowed to do nothing without his sanction. He\r\nhimself was elected consul at first for five, then for ten years, and\r\nat last for life. Under Augustus the consulship was a mere shadow\r\nof what it had been: the consuls no longer held their office for a\r\nwhole year, but usually for a few months only; and hence it happened\r\nthat sometimes one year saw six, twelve, or even twenty-five consuls.\r\nThose who were elected the first in the year ranked higher than the\r\nrest, and their names alone were used to mark the year, according to\r\nthe ancient custom of the Romans of marking the date of an event by\r\nthe names of the consuls of the year in which the event occurred.\r\nDuring the last period of the empire it became the practice to have\r\ntitular or honorary consuls, who were elected by the senate and\r\nconfirmed by the emperor. Constantine appointed two consuls, one\r\nfor Rome and another for Constantinople, who held their office for a\r\nwhole year, and whose functions were only those of chief justices.\r\nAll the other consuls were designated as _honorarii_ or _consulares_.\r\nBut though the consulship had thus become almost an empty title, it\r\nwas still regarded as the highest dignity in the empire, and as the\r\nobject of the greatest ambition. It was connected with very great\r\nexpenses, partly on account of the public games which a consul had\r\nto provide, and partly on account of the large donations he had to\r\nmake to the people. The last consul at Rome was Decimus Theodorus\r\nPaulinus, A.D. 536, and at Constantinople, Flavius Basilius junior,\r\nA.D. 541.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSŬLARIS, signified, under the republic, a person who had held the\r\noffice of consul; but under the empire, it was the title of many\r\nmagistrates and public officers, who enjoyed the insignia of consular\r\ndignity, without having filled the office of consul. Thus we find\r\ncommanders of armies and governors of provinces called _Consulares_\r\nunder the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTĬO, a contraction for _conventio_, that is, a meeting, or a\r\n_conventus_. In the technical sense, however, a contio was an\r\nassembly of the people at Rome convened by a magistrate for the\r\npurpose of making the people acquainted with measures which were\r\nto be brought before the next comitia, and of working upon them\r\neither to support or oppose the measure. But no question of any kind\r\ncould be decided by a contio, and this constitutes the difference\r\nbetween contiones and comitia. Still contiones were also convened\r\nfor other purposes, _e.g._ of persuading the people to take part in\r\na war, or of bringing complaints against a party in the republic.\r\nEvery magistrate had the right to convene contiones, but it was most\r\nfrequently exercised by the consuls and tribunes, and the latter more\r\nespecially exercised a great influence over the people in and through\r\nthese contiones. A magistrate who was higher in rank than the one who\r\nhad convened a contio, had the right to order the people to disperse,\r\nif he disapproved of the object. It should be remarked, that the term\r\ncontio is also used to designate the speeches and harangues addressed\r\nto the people in an assembly, and that in a loose mode of speaking,\r\ncontio denotes any assembly of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTŬBERNĀLES (σύσκηνοι), signified originally men who served in\r\nthe same army and lived in the same tent. The word is derived from\r\n_taberna_ (afterwards _tabernaculum_), which was the original name\r\nfor a military tent, as it was made of boards (_tabulae_). Each tent\r\nwas occupied by ten soldiers (_contubernales_), with a subordinate\r\nofficer at their head, who was called _decanus_, and in later times\r\n_caput contubernii_. Young Romans of illustrious families used to\r\naccompany a distinguished general on his expeditions, or to his\r\nprovince, for the purpose of gaining under his superintendence a\r\npractical training in the art of war, or in the administration of\r\npublic affairs, and were, like soldiers living in the same tent,\r\ncalled his _contubernales_. In a still wider sense, the name\r\n_contubernales_ was applied to persons connected by ties of intimate\r\nfriendship, and living under the same roof; and hence, when a freeman\r\nand a slave, or two slaves, who were not allowed to contract a legal\r\nmarriage, lived together as husband and wife, they were called\r\n_contubernales_; and their connection, as well as their place of\r\nresidence, _contubernium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTŬBERNĬUM. [CONTUBERNALES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVĔNĪRE IN MĂNUM. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVENTUS, was the name applied to the whole body of Roman citizens\r\nwho were either permanently or for a time settled in a province. In\r\norder to facilitate the administration of justice, a province was\r\ndivided into a number of districts or circuits, each of which was\r\ncalled _conventus_, _forum_, or _jurisdictio_. Roman citizens living\r\nin a province were entirely under the jurisdiction of the proconsul;\r\nand at certain times of the year, fixed by the proconsul, they\r\nassembled in the chief town of the district, and this meeting bore\r\nthe name of _conventus_ (σύνοδος). Hence the expressions--_conventus\r\nagere_, _peragere_, _convocare_, _dimittere_. At this conventus\r\nlitigant parties applied to the proconsul, who selected a number of\r\njudges from the conventus to try their causes. The proconsul himself\r\npresided at the trials, and pronounced the sentence according to\r\nthe views of the judges, who were his assessors (_consilium_ or\r\n_consiliarii_). These conventus appear to have been generally held\r\nafter the proconsul had settled the military affairs of the province;\r\nat least, when Caesar was proconsul of Gaul, he made it a regular\r\npractice to hold the conventus after his armies had retired to their\r\nwinter quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVĪVĬUM. [SYMPOSIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎPHĬNUS (κόφινος, Engl. _coffin_), a large kind of wicker basket,\r\nmade of willow branches. It would seem that it was used by the Greeks\r\nas a basket or cage for birds. The Romans used it for agricultural\r\npurposes, and it sometimes formed a kind of portable hot-bed.\r\nJuvenal, when speaking of the Jews, uses the expression _cophinus et\r\nfoenum_ (a truss of hay), figuratively to designate their poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORBIS, _dim_. CORBŬLA, CORBĬCŬLA, a basket of very peculiar form\r\nand common use among the Romans, both for agricultural and other\r\npurposes. It was made of osiers twisted together, and was of a\r\nconical or pyramidal shape. A basket answering precisely to this\r\ndescription, both in form and material, is still to be seen in\r\nevery-day use among the Campanian peasantry, which is called in the\r\nlanguage of the country “la corbella.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCORBĪTAE, merchantmen of the larger class, so called because they\r\nhung out a _corbis_ at the mast-head for a sign. They were also\r\ntermed _onerariae_; and hence Plautus, in order to designate the\r\nvoracious appetites of some women, says, “Corbitam cibi comesse\r\npossunt.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cornu. (Bartholini de Tibiis.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Altar of Julius Victor. (Bartoli, Pict. Ant., p. 76.)]\r\n\r\nCORNU, a wind instrument, anciently made of horn, but afterwards\r\nof brass. Like the _tuba_, it differed from the _tibia_ in being a\r\nlarger and more powerful instrument, and from the _tuba_ itself, in\r\nbeing curved nearly in the shape of a C, with a cross-piece to steady\r\nthe instrument for the convenience of the performer. Hence Ovid says\r\n(_Met._ i. 98):\r\n\r\n      “Non tuba _directi_, non aeris cornua _flexi_.”\r\n\r\nThe _classicum_, which originally meant a signal, rather than the\r\nmusical instrument which gave the signal, was usually sounded with\r\nthe _cornu_.\r\n\r\n      “Sonuit reflexo classicum cornu,\r\n      Lituusque _adunco_ stridulos cantus\r\n      Elisit aere.”\r\n                                (Sen. _Oed._ 734.)\r\n\r\nThe _Cornicines_ and _Liticines_, the persons who blew the _Cornu_\r\nand _Lituus_, formed a collegium. In the preceding cut, M. Julius\r\nVictor, a member of the Collegium, holds a lituus in his right hand,\r\nand touches with his left a cornu on the ground. See engraving under\r\nTUBA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corona Civica, on a Coin of the Emperor Galba.\r\n\r\nSPQR OB CS = Senatus Populusque Romanus ob civem servatum.]\r\n\r\nCŎRŌNA (στέφανος), a crown, that is, a circular ornament of metal,\r\nleaves, or flowers, worn by the ancients round the head or neck,\r\nand used as a festive as well as funereal decoration, and as a\r\nreward of talent, military or naval prowess, and civil worth. Its\r\nfirst introduction as an honorary reward is attributable to the\r\nathletic games, in some of which it was bestowed as a prize upon\r\nthe victor. It was the only reward contended for by the Spartans in\r\ntheir gymnic contests, and was worn by them when going to battle.\r\nThe Romans refined upon the practice of the Greeks, and invented a\r\ngreat variety of crowns formed of different materials, each with a\r\nseparate appellation, and appropriated to a particular purpose.--I.\r\nCORONA OBSIDIONALIS. Amongst the honorary crowns bestowed by the\r\nRomans for military achievements, the most difficult of attainment,\r\nand the one which conferred the highest honour, was the _corona\r\nobsidionalis_, presented by a beleaguered army after its liberation\r\nto the general who broke up the siege. It was made of grass, or weeds\r\nand wild flowers, thence called _corona graminea_, and _graminea\r\nobsidionalis_, gathered from the spot on which the beleaguered\r\narmy had been enclosed.--II. CORONA CIVICA, the second in honour\r\nand importance, was presented to the soldier who had preserved the\r\nlife of a Roman citizen in battle. It was made of the leaves of the\r\noak. The soldier who had acquired this crown had a place reserved\r\nnext to the senate at all the public spectacles; and they, as well\r\nas the rest of the company, rose up upon his entrance. He was freed\r\nfrom all public burthens, as were also his father, and his paternal\r\ngrandfather; and the person who owed his life to him was bound, ever\r\nafter, to cherish his preserver as a parent, and afford him all such\r\noffices as were due from a son to his father.--III. CORONA NAVALIS or\r\nROSTRATA, called also CLASSICA. It is difficult to determine whether\r\nthese were two distinct crowns, or only two denominations for the\r\nsame one. It seems probable that the _navalis corona_, besides being\r\na generic term, was inferior in dignity to the latter, and given to\r\nthe sailor who first boarded an enemy’s ship; whereas the _rostrata_\r\nwas given to a commander who destroyed the whole fleet, or gained\r\nany very signal victory. At all events, they were both made of gold;\r\nand one at least (_rostrata_) decorated with the beaks of ships like\r\nthe _rostra_ in the forum. The Athenians likewise bestowed golden\r\ncrowns for naval services; sometimes upon the person who got his\r\ntrireme first equipped, and at others upon the captain who had his\r\nvessel in the best order.--IV. CORONA MURALIS, was presented by the\r\ngeneral to the first man who scaled the wall of a besieged city. It\r\nwas made of gold, and decorated with turrets.--V. CORONA CASTRENSIS\r\nor VALLARIS, was presented to the first soldier who surmounted the\r\n_vallum_, and forced an entrance into the enemy’s camp. This crown\r\nwas made of gold, and ornamented with the palisades (_valli_) used\r\nin forming an entrenchment.--VI. CORONA TRIUMPHALIS. There were\r\nthree sorts of triumphal crowns: the first was made of laurel or\r\nbay leaves, and was worn round the head of the commander during his\r\ntriumph; the second was of gold, which, being too large and massive\r\nto be worn, was held over the head of the general during his triumph,\r\nby a public officer. This crown, as well as the former one, was\r\npresented to the victorious general by his army. The third kind,\r\nlikewise of gold and of great value, was sent as a present from the\r\nprovinces to the commander. [AURUM CORONARIUM.]--VII. CORONA OVALIS,\r\nwas given to a commander who obtained only an ovation. It was made\r\nof myrtle.--VIII. CORONA OLEAGINA, was made of the olive leaf,\r\nand conferred upon the soldiers as well as their commanders.--The\r\nGreeks in general made but little use of crowns as rewards of valour\r\nin the earlier periods of their history, except as prizes in the\r\nathletic contests; but previous to the time of Alexander, crowns of\r\ngold were profusely distributed, amongst the Athenians at least,\r\nfor every trifling feat, whether civil, naval, or military, which,\r\nthough lavished without much discrimination as far as regards the\r\ncharacter of the receiving parties, were still subjected to certain\r\nlegal restrictions in respect of the time, place, and mode in which\r\nthey were conferred. They could not be presented but in the public\r\nassemblies, and with the consent, that is by suffrage, of the people,\r\nor by the senators in their council, or by the tribes to their own\r\nmembers, or by the δημόται to members of their own δῆμος. According\r\nto the statement of Aeschines, the people could not lawfully present\r\ncrowns in any place except in their assembly, nor the senators\r\nexcept in the senate-house; nor, according to the same authority,\r\nin the theatre, which is, however, denied by Demosthenes; nor at\r\nthe public games, and if any crier there proclaimed the crowns he\r\nwas subject to _atimia_. Neither could any person holding an office\r\nreceive a crown whilst he was ὑπεύθυνος, that is, before he had\r\npassed his accounts.--The second class of crowns were emblematical\r\nand not honorary, and the adoption of them was not regulated by\r\nlaw, but custom. Of these there were also several kinds.--I. CORONA\r\nSACERDOTALIS, was worn by the priests (_sacerdotes_), with the\r\nexception of the pontifex maximus and his minister (_camillus_),\r\nas well as the bystanders, when officiating at the sacrifice. It\r\ndoes not appear to have been confined to any one material.--II.\r\nCORONA FUNEBRIS and SEPULCHRALIS. The Greeks first set the example\r\nof crowning the dead with chaplets of leaves and flowers, which was\r\nimitated by the Romans. Garlands of flowers were also placed upon\r\nthe bier, or scattered from the windows under which the procession\r\npassed, or entwined about the cinerary urn, or as a decoration to\r\nthe tomb. In Greece these crowns were commonly made of parsley.--III.\r\nCORONA CONVIVIALIS. The use of chaplets at festive entertainments\r\nsprung likewise from Greece. They were of various shrubs and flowers,\r\nsuch as roses (which were the choicest), violets, myrtle, ivy,\r\n_philyra_, and even parsley.--IV. CORONA NUPTIALIS. The bridal wreath\r\nwas also of Greek origin, among whom it was made of flowers plucked\r\nby the bride herself, and not bought, which was of ill omen. Amongst\r\nthe Romans it was made of _verbena_, also gathered by the bride\r\nherself, and worn under the _flammeum_, with which the bride was\r\nalways enveloped. The bridegroom also wore a chaplet. The doors of\r\nhis house were likewise decorated with garlands, and also the bridal\r\ncouch.--V. CORONA NATALITIA, the chaplet suspended over the door of\r\nthe vestibule, both in the houses of Athens and Rome, in which a\r\nchild was born. At Athens, when the infant was male, the crown was\r\nmade of olive; when female, of wool. At Rome it was of laurel, ivy,\r\nor parsley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Females with Crowns. (From an ancient Painting.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎRŌNIS (κορωνίς), the cornice of an entablature, is properly a Greek\r\nword signifying anything curved. It is also used by Latin writers,\r\nbut the genuine Latin word for a _cornice_ is _corona_ or _coronix_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTĪNA, the name of the table or hollow slab, supported by a tripod,\r\nupon which the priestess at Delphi sat to deliver her responses; and\r\nhence the word is used for the oracle itself. The Romans made tables\r\nof marble or bronze after the pattern of the Delphian tripod, which\r\nthey used as we do our sideboards, for the purpose of displaying\r\ntheir plate at an entertainment. These were termed _cortinae\r\nDelphicae_, or _Delphicae_ simply.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎRỸBANTĬCA (κορυβαντικά), a festival and mysteries celebrated at\r\nCnossus in Crete, by the Corybantes. (See _Class. Dict._, CORYBANTES.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎRYMBUS (κόρυμβος). [COMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCORVUS, a sort of crane, used by C. Duilius against the Carthaginian\r\nfleet in the battle fought off Mylae, in Sicily (B.C. 260). The\r\nRomans, we are told, being unused to the sea, saw that their only\r\nchance of victory was by bringing a sea-fight to resemble one on\r\nland. For this purpose they invented a machine, of which Polybius\r\nhas left a minute description. In the fore part of the ship a round\r\npole was fixed perpendicularly, twenty-four feet in height and about\r\nnine inches in diameter; at the top of this was a pivot, upon which\r\na ladder was set, thirty-six feet in length and four in breadth.\r\nThe ladder was guarded by cross-beams, fastened to the upright pole\r\nby a ring of wood, which turned with the pivot above. Along the\r\nladder a rope was passed, one end of which took hold of the _corvus_\r\nby means of a ring. The _corvus_ itself was a strong piece of iron,\r\nwith a spike at the end, which was raised or lowered by drawing in\r\nor letting out the rope. When an enemy’s ship drew near, the machine\r\nwas turned outwards, by means of the pivot, in the direction of the\r\nassailant. Another part of the machine was a breast-work, let down\r\nfrom the ladder, and serving as a bridge, on which to board the\r\nenemy’s vessel. By means of these cranes the Carthaginian ships were\r\neither broken or closely locked with the Roman, and Duilius gained a\r\ncomplete victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŌRȲTOS or CŌRȲTUS (γωρυτός, κωρυτός), [ARCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSMĒTAE, a class of slaves among the Romans, whose duty it was to\r\ndress and adorn ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSMI (κοσμοί), the supreme magistrates in Crete, were ten in number,\r\nand were chosen, not from the body of the people, but from certain\r\nγένη or houses, which were probably of more pure Doric or Achaean\r\ndescent than their neighbours. The first of them in rank was called\r\n_protocosmus_, and gave his name to the year. They commanded in war,\r\nand also conducted the business of the state with the representatives\r\nand ambassadors of other cities. Their period of office was a year;\r\nbut any of them during that time might resign, and was also liable\r\nto deposition by his colleagues. In some cases, too, they might be\r\nindicted for neglect of their duties. On the whole, we may conclude\r\nthat they formed the executive and chief power in most of the cities\r\nof Crete.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cothurnus. (From Statues of Artemis--Diana.)]\r\n\r\nCŎTHURNUS (κόθορνος), a boot. Its essential distinction was its\r\nheight; it rose above the middle of the leg, so as to surround\r\nthe calf, and sometimes it reached as high as the knees. It was\r\nworn principally by horsemen, by hunters, and by men of rank and\r\nauthority. The sole of the cothurnus was commonly of the ordinary\r\nthickness; but it was sometimes made much thicker than usual,\r\nprobably by the insertion of slices of cork. The object was, to add\r\nto the apparent stature of the wearer; and this was done in the case\r\nof the actors in Athenian tragedy, who had the soles made unusually\r\nthick as one of the methods adopted in order to magnify their whole\r\nappearance. Hence tragedy in general was called _cothurnus_. As the\r\ncothurnus was commonly worn in hunting, it is represented as part of\r\nthe costume of Artemis (Diana).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTĂBUS (κότταβος), a social game which was introduced from Sicily\r\ninto Greece, where it became one of the favourite amusements of young\r\npeople after their repasts. The simplest way in which it originally\r\nwas played was this:--One of the company threw out of a goblet a\r\ncertain quantity of wine, at a certain distance, into a metal basin.\r\nWhile he was doing this, he either thought of or pronounced the name\r\nof his mistress; and if all the wine fell in the basin, and with a\r\nfull sound, it was a good sign for the lover. This simple amusement\r\nsoon assumed a variety of different characters, and became, in\r\nsome instances, a regular contest, with prizes for the victor. One\r\nof the most celebrated modes in which it was carried on is called\r\nδι’ ὀξυβάφων. A basin was filled with water, with small empty cups\r\n(ὀξύβαφα) swimming upon it. Into these the young men, one after\r\nanother, threw the remnant of the wine from their goblets, and he who\r\nhad the good fortune to drown most of the bowls obtained the prize,\r\nconsisting either of simple cakes, sweetmeats, or sesame-cakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎTYTTĬA (κοττύτια), a festival which was originally celebrated by\r\nthe Edonians of Thrace, in honour of a goddess called Cotys, or\r\nCotytto. It was held at night. The worship of Cotys, together with\r\nthe festival of the Cotyttia, was adopted by several Greek states,\r\nchiefly those which were induced by their commercial interest to\r\nmaintain friendly relations with Thrace. The festivals of this\r\ngoddess were notorious among the ancients for the dissolute manner\r\nand the debaucheries with which they were celebrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎTỸLA (κοτύλη), a measure of capacity among the Romans and Greeks:\r\nby the former it was also called _hemina_; by the latter, τρυβλίον\r\nand ἡμίνα or ἡμίμνα. It was the half of the sextarius or ξέστης, and\r\ncontained 6 cyathi, or nearly half a pint English.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŎVĪNUS (Celtic, _kowain_), a kind of car, the spokes of which were\r\narmed with long sickles, and which was used as a scythe-chariot\r\nchiefly by the ancient Belgians and Britons. The Romans designated,\r\nby the name of covinus, a kind of travelling carriage, which seems\r\nto have been covered on all sides with the exception of the front.\r\nIt had no seat for a driver, but was conducted by the traveller\r\nhimself, who sat inside. The _covinarii_ (this word occurs only in\r\nTacitus) seem to have constituted a regular and distinct part of a\r\nBritish army. Compare ESSEDUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRĀTER (κρατήρ, Ionic κρητήρ, from κεράννυμι, I mix), a vessel in\r\nwhich the wine, according to the custom of the ancients, who very\r\nseldom drank it pure, was mixed with water, and from which the cups\r\nwere filled. Craters were among the first things on the embellishment\r\nof which the ancient artists exercised their skill; and the number of\r\ncraters dedicated in temples seems everywhere to have been very great.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRĔPĬDA (κρηπίς), a slipper. Slippers were worn with the pallium, not\r\nwith the toga, and were properly characteristic of the Greeks, though\r\nadopted from them by the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRĪMEN. Though this word occurs so frequently, it is not easy to fix\r\nits meaning. _Crimen_ is often equivalent to _accusatio_ (κατηγορία);\r\nbut it frequently means an act which is legally punishable. Those\r\ndelicta which were punishable according to special leges, senatus\r\nconsulta, and constitutiones, and were prosecuted in judicia publica\r\nby an accusatio publica, were more especially called crimina; and\r\nthe penalties in case of conviction were loss of life, of freedom,\r\nof civitas, and the consequent infamia, and sometimes pecuniary\r\npenalties also.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRISTA. [GALEA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCRĬTES (κριτής), a judge, was the name applied by the Greeks to any\r\nperson who did not judge of a thing like a δικαστής, according to\r\npositive laws, but according to his own sense of justice and equity.\r\nBut at Athens a number of κριταί was chosen by ballot from a number\r\nof selected candidates at every celebration of the Dionysia: they\r\nwere called οἱ κριταί, κατ’ ἐξοχήν. Their office was to judge of the\r\nmerit of the different choruses and dramatic poems, and to award the\r\nprizes to the victors. Their number was five for comedy and the same\r\nnumber for tragedy, one being taken from every tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRŌBỸLUS. [COMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCRŎCŌTA (sc. _vestis_, κροκωτὸν sc. ἱμάτιον, or κροκωτὸς sc. χιτών),\r\nwas a kind of gala-dress, chiefly worn by women on solemn occasions,\r\nand in Greece especially, at the festival of the Dionysia. Its name\r\nwas derived from _crocus_, one of the favourite colours of the Greek\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRŎTĂLUM. [CYMBALUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUSTA. [CAELATURA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUX (σταυρός, σκόλοψ), an instrument of capital punishment, used by\r\nseveral ancient nations, especially the Romans and Carthaginians.\r\nCrucifixion was of two kinds, the less usual sort being rather\r\nimpalement than what we should describe by the word crucifixion, as\r\nthe criminal was transfixed by a pole, which passed through the back\r\nand spine and came out at the mouth. The cross was of several kinds;\r\none in the shape of an X, called _crux Andreana_, because tradition\r\nreports St. Andrew to have suffered upon it; another was formed like\r\na T. The third, and most common sort, was made of two pieces of wood\r\ncrossed, so as to make four right angles. It was on this, according\r\nto the unanimous testimony of the fathers, that our Saviour suffered.\r\nThe punishment, as is well known, was chiefly inflicted on slaves,\r\nand the worst kind of malefactors. The criminal, after sentence\r\npronounced, carried his cross to the place of execution; a custom\r\nmentioned in the Gospels. Scourging appears to have formed a part\r\nof this, as of other capital punishments among the Romans; but the\r\nscourging of our Saviour is not to be regarded in this light, for\r\nit was inflicted before sentence was pronounced. The criminal was\r\nnext stripped of his clothes and nailed or bound to the cross. The\r\nlatter was the more painful method, as the sufferer was left to die\r\nof hunger. Instances are recorded of persons who survived nine days.\r\nIt was usual to leave the body on the cross after death. The breaking\r\nof the legs of the thieves, mentioned in the Gospels, was accidental;\r\nbecause, by the Jewish law, it is expressly remarked, the bodies\r\ncould not remain on the cross during the Sabbath-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYPTA (from κρύπτειν, to conceal), a crypt. Amongst the Romans,\r\nany long narrow vault, whether wholly or partially below the level\r\nof the earth, is expressed by this term. The specific senses of the\r\nword are:--(1) A covered portico or arcade; called more definitely\r\n_crypto-porticus_, because it was not supported by open columns like\r\nthe ordinary portico, but closed at the sides, with windows only for\r\nthe admission of light and air.--(2) A grotto, particularly one open\r\nat both extremities, forming what in modern language is denominated a\r\n“tunnel.” A subterranean vault used for any secret worship was also\r\ncalled _crypta_.--(3) When the practice of consuming the body by fire\r\nwas relinquished [FUNUS], and a number of bodies was consigned to one\r\nplace of burial, as the catacombs for instance, this common tomb was\r\ncalled _crypta_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYPTEIA (κρυπτεία), the name of an atrocious practice at Sparta,\r\nsaid to have been introduced by Lycurgus. The following is the\r\ndescription given of the crypteia. The ephors, at intervals, selected\r\nfrom among the young Spartans, those who appeared to be best\r\nqualified for the task, and sent them in various directions all over\r\nthe country, provided with daggers and their necessary food. During\r\nthe day-time, these young men concealed themselves; but at night they\r\nbroke forth into the high-roads, and massacred those of the helots\r\nwhom they met, or whom they thought proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŬBĬCŬLĀRĬI, slaves who had the care of the sleeping and dwelling\r\nrooms. Faithful slaves were always selected for this office, as they\r\nhad, to a certain extent, the care of their master’s person. It was\r\nthe duty of the cubicularii to introduce visitors to their master.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŬBĬCŬLUM usually means a sleeping and dwelling room in a Roman house\r\n[DOMUS], but it is also applied to the pavilion or tent in which\r\nthe Roman emperors were accustomed to witness the public games. It\r\nappears to have been so called, because the emperors were accustomed\r\nto recline in the cubicula, instead of sitting, as was anciently the\r\npractice, in a sella curulis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŬBĬTUS (πῆχυς), a Greek and Roman measure of length, originally\r\nthe length of the human arm from the elbow to the wrist, or to the\r\nknuckle of the middle finger. It was equal to a foot and a half,\r\nwhich gives 1 foot 5·4744 inches Eng. for the Roman, and 1 foot\r\n6·2016 inches for the Greek cubit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŬCULLUS, a cowl. As the cowl was intended to be used in the open\r\nair, and to be drawn over the head to protect it from the injuries\r\nof the weather, instead of a hat or cap, it was attached only to\r\ngarments of the coarsest kind. The cucullus was also used by persons\r\nin the higher circles of society, when they wished to go abroad\r\nwithout being known.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪDO or CŪDON, a skull-cap made of leather or of the rough shaggy fur\r\nof any wild animal, such as were worn by the _velites_ of the Roman\r\narmies, and apparently synonymous with _galerus_ or _galericulus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪLĔUS, or CULLĔUS, a Roman measure, which was used for estimating\r\nthe produce of vineyards. It was the largest liquid measure used by\r\nthe Romans, containing 20 amphorae, or 118 gallons, 7·546 pints.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŬLĪNA. [DOMUS, p. 143.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cultri (From Tombstone of a Cultrarius.)]\r\n\r\nCULTER (μάχαιρα, κοπίς, or σφαγίς), a knife with only one edge, which\r\nformed a straight line. The blade was pointed, and its back curved.\r\nIt was used for a variety of purposes, but chiefly for killing\r\nanimals either in the slaughter-house, or in hunting, or at the\r\naltars of the gods. The priest who conducted a sacrifice never killed\r\nthe victim himself; but one of his ministri, appointed for that\r\npurpose, who was called either by the general name _minister_, or the\r\nmore specific _popa_ or _cultrarius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTRĀRĬUS. [CULTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŬNĔUS was the name applied to a body of foot soldiers, drawn up in\r\nthe form of a wedge, for the purpose of breaking through an enemy’s\r\nline. The common soldiers called it a _caput porcinum_, or pig’s\r\nhead. The name _cuneus_ was also applied to the compartments of\r\nseats in circular or semi-circular theatres, which were so arranged\r\nas to converge to the centre of the theatre, and diverge towards\r\nthe external walls of the building, with passages between each\r\ncompartment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŬNĪCŬLUS (ὑπόνομος), a mine or passage underground, was so called\r\nfrom its resemblance to the burrowing of a rabbit. Fidenae and Veii\r\nare said to have been taken by mines, which opened, one of them into\r\nthe citadel, the other into the temple of Juno.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪPA, a wine-vat, a vessel very much like the _dolium_, and used for\r\nthe same purpose, namely, to receive the fresh must, and to contain\r\nit during the process of fermentation. The inferior wines were drawn\r\nfor drinking from the _cupa_, without being bottled in _amphorae_,\r\nand hence the term _vinum de cupa_. The _cupa_ was either made of\r\nearthenware, like the _dolium_, or of wood, and covered with pitch.\r\nIt was also used for fruits and corn, forming rafts, and containing\r\ncombustibles in war, and even for a sarcophagus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪRĀTOR. Till a Roman youth attained the age of puberty, which was\r\ngenerally fixed at fourteen years of age, he was incapable of any\r\nlegal act, and was under the authority of a _tutor_ or guardian;\r\nbut with the attainment of the age of puberty, he became capable of\r\nperforming every legal act, and was freed from the control of his\r\n_tutor_. As, however, a person of that tender age was liable to be\r\nimposed upon, the lex Plaetoria enacted that every person between\r\nthe time of puberty and twenty-five years of age should be under\r\nthe protection of a _curator_. The date of this lex is not known,\r\nthough it is certain that the law existed when Plautus wrote (about\r\nB.C. 200), who speaks of it as the _lex quina vicemaria_. This law\r\nestablished a distinction of age, which was of great practical\r\nimportance, by forming the citizens into two classes, those above\r\nand those below twenty-five years of age (_minores viginti quinque\r\nannis_). A person under the last-mentioned age was sometimes simply\r\ncalled _minor_. The object of the lex was to protect persons under\r\ntwenty-five years of age against all fraud (_dolus_). A person who\r\nwasted his property (_prodigus_), and a person of unsound mind\r\n(_furiosus, demens_), were also placed under the care of a _curator_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪRĀTŌRES were public officers of various kinds under the Roman\r\nempire, such as the _curatores annonae_, the _curatores ludorum_, the\r\n_curatores regionum_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪRĬA, signifies both a division of the Roman people and the place\r\nof assembly for such a division. Each of the three ancient Romulian\r\ntribes, the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, was subdivided into 10\r\ncuriae, so that the whole body of the populus or the patricians was\r\ndivided into 30 curiae. The plebeians had no connection whatever\r\nwith the curiae. All the members of the different gentes belonging\r\nto one curia were called, in respect of one another, _curiales_.\r\nThe division into curiae was of great political importance in the\r\nearliest times of Rome, for the curiae alone contained the citizens,\r\nand their assembly alone was the legitimate representative of the\r\nwhole people. [COMITIA CURIATA.] Each curia as a corporation had its\r\npeculiar sacra, and besides the gods of the state, they worshipped\r\nother divinities and with peculiar rites and ceremonies. For such\r\nreligious purposes each curia had its own place of worship, called\r\ncuria, in which the curiales assembled for the purpose of discussing\r\npolitical, financial, religious and other matters. The religious\r\naffairs of each curia were taken care of by a priest, _Curio_, who\r\nwas assisted by another called curialis Flamen. As there were 30\r\ncuriae, there were likewise 30 curiones, who formed a college of\r\npriests, presided over by one of them, called _Curio Maximus_. The\r\n30 curiae had each its distinct name, which are said to have been\r\nderived from the names of the Sabine women who had been carried off\r\nby the Romans, though it is evident that some derived their names\r\nfrom certain districts or from ancient eponymous heroes. Curia\r\nis also used to designate the place in which the senate held its\r\nmeetings, such as curia Hostilia, curia Julia, curia Pompeii, and\r\nfrom this there gradually arose the custom of calling the senate\r\nitself in the Italian towns curia, but never the senate of Rome. The\r\nofficial residence of the Salii, which was dedicated to Mars, was\r\nlikewise styled curia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪRIĀTA CŎMĬTĬA. [COMITIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪRĬO. [CURIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŪRĬUS (κύριος), signified generally at Athens the person responsible\r\nfor the welfare of such members of a family as the law presumed to\r\nbe incapable of protecting themselves; as, for instance, minors and\r\nslaves, and women of all ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Currus. (Ancient Chariot preserved in the Vatican.)]\r\n\r\nCURRUS (ἅρμα), a chariot, a car. These terms appear to have denoted\r\nthose two-wheeled vehicles for the carriage of persons, which were\r\nopen overhead, thus differing from the _carpentum_, and closed in\r\nfront, in which they differed from the _cisium_. The most essential\r\narticles in the construction of the currus were, 1. The rim (ἄντυξ)\r\n[ANTYX]. 2. The axle (ἄξων, _axis_). 3. The wheels (κύκλα, τροχοί,\r\n_rotae_), which revolved upon the axle, and were prevented from\r\ncoming off by the insertion of pins (ἔμβολοι) into the extremities\r\nof the axles. The parts of the wheel were:--(_a_) The nave (πλήμνη,\r\n_modiolus_). (_b_) The spokes (κνῆμαι, literally, the _legs, radii_.)\r\n(_c_) The felly (ἴτυς). (_d_) The tire (ἐπίσωτρον, _canthus_). 4.\r\nThe pole (ῥυμός, _temo_). All the parts above mentioned are seen\r\nin the preceding cut of an ancient chariot. The Greeks and Romans\r\nappear never to have used more than one pole and one yoke, and the\r\ncurrus thus constructed was commonly drawn by two horses, which were\r\nattached to it by their necks, and therefore called δίζυγες ἵπποι,\r\nσυνωρίς, _gemini jugales_, _equi bijuges_, &c. If a third horse was\r\nadded, as was not unfrequently the case, it was fastened by traces.\r\nThe horse so attached was called παρήορος, παράσειρος, σειραφόρος,\r\nin Latin, _funalis_, and is opposed to the ζυγῖται or ζύγιοι, the\r\nyoke-horses. The ἵππος παρήορος is placed on the right of the two\r\nyoke-horses. (See woodcut.) The Latin name for a chariot and pair\r\nwas _biga_, generally _bigae_. When a third horse was added, it was\r\ncalled _triga_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Triga. (From a Painting on a Vase.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quadrigae. (From Paintings on a Vase and a\r\nTerra-cotta.)]\r\n\r\nA chariot and four was called _quadriga_, generally _quadrigae_; in\r\nGreek, τετραορία or τέθριππος. The horses were commonly harnessed in\r\na quadriga after the manner already represented, the two strongest\r\nhorses being placed under the yoke, and the two others fastened\r\non each side by means of ropes. This is clearly seen in the two\r\nquadrigae figured below, especially in the one on the right hand. It\r\nrepresents a chariot overthrown in passing the goal at the circus.\r\nThe charioteer having fallen backwards, the pole and yoke are thrown\r\nupwards into the air; the two trace-horses have fallen on their\r\nknees, and the two yoke-horses are prancing on their hind legs.--The\r\ncurrus was adapted to carry two persons, and on this account was\r\ncalled in Greek δίφρος. One of the two was of course the driver. He\r\nwas called ἡνίοχος, because he held the reins, and his companion\r\nπαραβάτης, from going by his side or near him. In the Homeric ages,\r\nchariots were commonly employed on the field of battle. The men of\r\nrank all took their chariots with them, and in an engagement placed\r\nthemselves in front. Chariots were not much used by the Romans. The\r\nmost splendid kind were the quadrigae, in which the Roman generals\r\nand emperors rode when they triumphed. The body of the triumphal car\r\nwas cylindrical, as we often see it represented on medals. It was\r\nenriched with gold and ivory. The utmost skill of the painter and\r\nthe sculptor was employed to enhance its beauty and splendour. The\r\ntriumphal car had in general no pole, the horses being led by men who\r\nwere stationed at their heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marble Chariot in the Vatican.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCURSŌRES, slaves whose duty it was to run before the carriage of\r\ntheir masters. They first came into fashion in the first century\r\nof the Christian aera. The word _cursores_ was also applied to all\r\nslaves whom their masters employed in carrying letters, messages, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURSUS. [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCŬRŪLIS SELLA.

(Museo Borbonico, vol. iv. pl. 12.)]\r\n\r\nCỸĂTHUS (κύαθος), a Greek and Roman liquid measure, containing\r\none-twelfth of the sextarius, or ·0825 of a pint English. The form\r\nof the cyathus used at banquets was that of a small ladle, by means\r\nof which the wine was conveyed into the drinking-cups from the large\r\nvessel (_crater_) in which it was mixed. Two of these cyathi are\r\nrepresented in the preceding woodcut. The cyathus was also the name\r\ngiven to a cup holding the same quantity as the measure. Hence Horace\r\nsays (_Carm._ iii. 8. 13):\r\n\r\n      “Sume, Maecenas, cyathos amici\r\n      Sospitis centum.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCYCLAS (κυκλάς), a circular robe worn by women, to the bottom of\r\nwhich a border was affixed, inlaid with gold. It appears to have been\r\nusually made of some thin material.\r\n\r\n\r\nCȲMA (κῦμα), in architecture, an _ogee_, a wave-shaped moulding,\r\nconsisting of two curves, the one concave and the other convex.\r\nThere were two forms, the _cyma recta_, which was concave above, and\r\nconvex below, thus, [Illustration], and the _cyma reversa_, which was\r\nconvex above and concave below, thus [Illustration]. The diminutive\r\n_cymatium_ or _cumatium_ (κυμάτιον) is also used, and is indeed the\r\nmore common name.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYMBA (κύμβη) is derived from κύμβος, a hollow, and is employed to\r\nsignify any small kind of boat used on lakes, rivers, &c. It appears\r\nto have been much the same as the _acatium_ and _scapha_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cymbala. (From a Bas-relief in the Vatican.)]\r\n\r\nCYMBĂLUM (κύμβαλον), a musical instrument, in the shape of two half\r\nglobes, which were held one in each hand by the performer, and\r\nplayed by being struck against each other. The word is derived from\r\nκύμβος, a hollow. The cymbal was a very ancient instrument, being\r\nused in the worship of Cybelé, Bacchus, Juno, and all the earlier\r\ndeities of the Grecian and Roman mythology. It probably came from the\r\nEast. The crotalum (κρόταλον) was a kind of cymbal. It appears to\r\nhave been a split reed or cane, which clattered when shaken with the\r\nhand. Women who played on the crotalum were termed _crotalistriae_.\r\nSuch was Virgil’s Copa:\r\n\r\n      “Crispum sub crotalo docta movere latus.”\r\n\r\nThe line alludes to the dance with crotala (similar to\r\ncastanets).--For _sistrum_, which some have referred to the class of\r\n_cymbala_, see SISTRUM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crotala. (Borghese Vase now in the Louvre.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDACTỸLUS (δάκτυλος), a Greek measure, answering to the Roman\r\n_digitus_, each signifying a _finger-breadth_, and being the\r\nsixteenth part of a foot. [PES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDAEDALA or DAEDĂLEIA (δαίδαλα, δαιδάλεια), names used by the Greeks\r\nto signify those early works of art which were ascribed to the age of\r\nDaedalus, and especially the ancient wooden statues, ornamented with\r\ngilding and bright colours and real drapery, which were the earliest\r\nknown forms of the images of the gods, after the mere blocks of wood\r\nor stone, which were at first used for symbols of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAEDĂLA (δαίδαλα), the name of two festivals, celebrated in Boeotia\r\nin honour of Hera, and called respectively the _Great_ and the\r\n_Lesser Daedala_. The latter were celebrated by the Plataeans alone;\r\nin the celebration of the former, which took place only every\r\nsixtieth year, the Plataeans were joined by the other Boeotians.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMARĔTĪON (δαμαρέτειον χρύσιον), a Sicilian coin, respecting which\r\nthere is much dispute; but it was probably a gold coin, equal in\r\nvalue to fifty litrae or ten Attic drachmae of silver; that is, a\r\nhalf stater.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMIURGI. [DEMIURGI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMŎSĬA. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDANĂCE (δανάκη), properly the name of a foreign coin, was also the\r\nname given to the obolos, which was placed in the mouth of the dead\r\nto pay the ferryman in Hades.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAPHNĒPHŎRĬA (δαφνηφόρια), a festival celebrated every ninth year at\r\nThebes in honour of Apollo, surnamed Ismenius or Galaxius. Its name\r\nwas derived from the laurel branches (δάφναι) which were carried by\r\nthose who took part in its celebration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĀREICUS (δαρεικός), or to give the name in full, the Stater of\r\nDareius, a gold coin of Persia, stamped on one side with the figure\r\nof an archer crowned and kneeling upon one knee, and on the other\r\nwith a sort of quadrata incusa or deep cleft. It is supposed to have\r\nderived its name from the first Dareius, king of Persia. It is equal\r\nto about 1_l._ 1_s._ 10_d._ 1·76 farthings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dareicus. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCĂDŪCHI (δεκαδοῦχοι), the members of a council of Ten, who\r\nsucceeded the Thirty in the supreme power at Athens, B.C. 403. They\r\nwere chosen from the ten tribes, one from each; but, though opposed\r\nto the Thirty, they sent ambassadors to Sparta to ask for assistance\r\nagainst Thrasybulus and the exiles. They remained masters of Athens\r\ntill the party of Thrasybulus obtained possession of the city and the\r\ndemocracy was restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCARCHĬA or DĔCĂDARCHĬA (δεκαρχία, δεκαδαρχία), a supreme council\r\nestablished in many of the Grecian cities by the Lacedaemonians, who\r\nentrusted to it the whole government of the state under the direction\r\nof a Spartan harmost. It always consisted of the leading members of\r\nthe aristocratical party.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCASMUS (δεκασμός), bribery. There were two actions for bribery at\r\nAthens: one, called δεκασμοῦ γραφή, lay against the person who gave\r\nthe bribe; and the other, called δώρων or δωροδοκίας γραφή, against\r\nthe person who received it. These actions applied to the bribery of\r\ncitizens in the public assemblies of the people (συνδεκάζειν τὴν\r\nἐκκλησίαν), of the Heliaea or any of the courts of justice, of the\r\nβουλή, and of the public advocates. Actions for bribery were under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the thesmothetae. The punishment on conviction\r\nof the defendant was death, or payment of ten times the value of the\r\ngift received, to which the court might add a further punishment\r\n(προστίμημα).\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCĂTE (δεκάτη). [DECUMAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCEMPĔDA, a pole ten feet long, used by the agrimensores\r\n[AGRIMENSORES] in measuring land. Thus we find that the agrimensores\r\nwere sometimes called _decempedatores_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCEMPRĪMI. [SENATUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCEMVĬRI, or the “ten-men,” the name of various magistrates and\r\nfunctionaries at Rome, of whom the most important were:--(1)\r\nDECEMVIRI LEGIBUS SCRIBENDIS, ten commissioners, who were appointed\r\nto draw up a code of laws. They were entrusted with supreme power\r\nin the state, and all the other magistracies were suspended. They\r\nentered upon their office at the beginning of the year B.C. 451; and\r\nthey discharged their duties with diligence, and dispensed justice\r\nwith impartiality. Each administered the government day by day in\r\nsuccession as during an interregnum; and the fasces were only carried\r\nbefore the one who presided for the day. They drew up a body of laws,\r\ndistributed into ten sections; which, after being approved of by\r\nthe senate and the comitia, were engraven on tables of metal, and\r\nset up in the comitium. On the expiration of their year of office,\r\nall parties were so well satisfied with the manner in which they\r\nhad discharged their duties, that it was resolved to continue the\r\nsame form of government for another year; more especially as some\r\nof the decemvirs said that their work was not finished. Ten new\r\ndecemvirs were accordingly elected, of whom App. Claudius alone\r\nbelonged to the former body. These magistrates framed several new\r\nlaws, which were approved of by the centuries, and engraven on two\r\nadditional tables. They acted, however, in a most tyrannical manner.\r\nEach was attended by twelve lictors, who carried not the rods only,\r\nbut the axes, the emblem of sovereignty. They made common cause\r\nwith the patrician party, and committed all kinds of outrages upon\r\nthe persons and property of the plebeians and their families. When\r\ntheir year of office expired they refused to resign or to appoint\r\nsuccessors. At length, the unjust decision of App. Claudius, in the\r\ncase of Virginia, which led her father to kill her with his own\r\nhands to save her from prostitution, occasioned an insurrection of\r\nthe people. The decemvirs were in consequence obliged to resign\r\ntheir office, B.C. 449; after which the usual magistracies were\r\nre-established. The ten tables of the former, and the two tables of\r\nthe latter decemvirs, form together the laws of the Twelve Tables,\r\nwhich were the groundwork of the Roman laws. This, the first attempt\r\nto make a code, remained also the only attempt for near one thousand\r\nyears, until the legislation of Justinian.--(2) DECEMVIRI LITIBUS or\r\nSTLITIBUS JUDICANDIS, were magistrates forming a court of justice,\r\nwhich took cognizance of civil cases. The history as well as the\r\npeculiar jurisdiction of this court during the time of the republic\r\nis involved in inextricable obscurity. In the time of Cicero it\r\nstill existed, and the proceedings in it took place in the ancient\r\nform of the sacramentum. Augustus transferred to these decemvirs\r\nthe presidency in the courts of the centumviri. During the empire,\r\nthis court had jurisdiction in capital matters, which is expressly\r\nstated in regard to the decemvirs.--(3) DECEMVIRI SACRIS FACIUNDIS,\r\nsometimes called simply DECEMVIRI SACRORUM, were the members of an\r\necclesiastical collegium, and were elected for life. Their chief duty\r\nwas to take care of the Sibylline books, and to inspect them on all\r\nimportant occasions by command of the senate. Under the kings the\r\ncare of the Sibylline books was committed to two men (_duumviri_) of\r\nhigh rank. On the expulsion of the kings, the care of these books was\r\nentrusted to the noblest of the patricians, who were exempted from\r\nall military and civil duties. Their number was increased about the\r\nyear 367 B.C. to ten, of whom five were chosen from the patricians\r\nand five from the plebeians. Subsequently their number was still\r\nfurther increased to fifteen (_quindecemviri_), probably by Sulla. It\r\nwas also the duty of the decemviri to celebrate the games of Apollo,\r\nand the secular games.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCENNĀLĬA or DĔCENNĬA, a festival celebrated with games every ten\r\nyears by the Roman emperors. This festival owed its origin to the\r\nfact that Augustus refused the supreme power when offered to him for\r\nhis life, and would only consent to accept it for ten years, and when\r\nthese expired, for another period of ten years, and so on to the end\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCĬMĀTĬO, the selection, by lot, of every tenth man for punishment,\r\nwhen any number of soldiers in the Roman army had been guilty of\r\nany crime. The remainder usually had barley allowed to them instead\r\nof wheat. This punishment appears not to have been inflicted in the\r\nearly times of the republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒCRĒTUM seems to mean that which is determined in a particular case\r\nafter examination or consideration. It is sometimes applied to a\r\ndetermination of the consuls, and sometimes to a determination of\r\nthe senate. A _decretum_ of the senate would seem to differ from\r\na _senatus-consultum_, in the way above indicated: it was limited\r\nto the special occasion and circumstances, and this would be true\r\nwhether the decretum was of a judicial or a legislative character.\r\nBut this distinction in the use of the two words, as applied to an\r\nact of the senate, was, perhaps, not always observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCŬMAE (sc. _partes_) formed a portion of the _vectigalia_ of the\r\nRomans, and were paid by subjects whose territory, either by conquest\r\nor _deditio_, had become the property of the state (_ager publicus_).\r\nThey consisted, as the name denotes, of a tithe or tenth of the\r\nproduce of the soil, levied upon the cultivators (_aratores_) or\r\noccupiers (_possessores_) of the lands, which, from being subject to\r\nthis payment, were called _agri decumani_. The tax of a tenth was,\r\nhowever, generally paid by corn lands: plantations and vineyards, as\r\nrequiring no seed and less labour, paid a fifth of the produce. A\r\nsimilar system existed in Greece also. Peisistratus, for instance,\r\nimposed a tax of a tenth on the lands of the Athenians, which the\r\nPeisistratidae lowered to a twentieth. At the time of the Persian\r\nwar the confederate Greeks made a vow, by which all the states\r\nwho had surrendered themselves to the enemy were subjected to the\r\npayment of tithes for the use of the god at Delphi. The tithes of\r\nthe public lands belonging to Athens were farmed out as at Rome to\r\ncontractors, called δεκατώναι: the term δεκατηλόγοι was applied to\r\nthe collectors; but the callings were, as we might suppose, often\r\nunited in the same person. The title δεκατευταί is applied to both.\r\nA δεκάτη, or tenth of a different kind, was the arbitrary exaction\r\nimposed by the Athenians (B.C. 410) on the cargoes of all ships\r\nsailing into or out of the Pontus. They lost it by the battle of\r\nAegospotami (B.C. 405); but it was re-established by Thrasybulus\r\nabout B.C. 391. The tithe was let out to farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCUNCIS, another name for the Dextans. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCŬRĬA. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCŬRĬŌNES. [COLONIA: EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔCUSSIS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒDĬCĀTĬO. [INAUGURATIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒDĬTĬCĬI, were those who had taken up arms against the Roman people,\r\nand being conquered, had surrendered themselves. Such people did not\r\nindividually lose their freedom, but as a community all political\r\nexistence, and of course had no other relation to Rome than that of\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒDUCTŌRES. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEIGMA (δεῖγμα), a particular place in the Peiraeeus, as well as\r\nin the harbours of other states, where merchants exposed samples\r\nof their goods for sale. The samples themselves were also called\r\n_deigmata_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEIPNON. [COENA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒLĀTOR, an informer. The delatores, under the emperors, were a\r\nclass of men who gained their livelihood by informing against their\r\nfellow-citizens. They constantly brought forward false charges to\r\ngratify the avarice or jealousy of the different emperors, and were\r\nconsequently paid according to the importance of the information\r\nwhich they gave.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒLECTUS. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒLĬA (δήλια), the name of festivals and games celebrated in the\r\nisland of Delos, to which the Cyclades and the neighbouring Ionians\r\non the coasts belonged. The Delia had existed from very early times,\r\nand were celebrated every fifth year. That the Athenians took part\r\nin these solemnities at a very early period, is evident from the\r\n_Deliastae_ (afterwards called θεωροί) mentioned in the laws of\r\nSolon; the sacred vessel (θεωρίς), moreover, which they sent to Delos\r\nevery year, was said to be the same which Theseus had sent after\r\nhis return from Crete. In the course of time the celebration of\r\nthis ancient panegyris in Delos had ceased, and it was not revived\r\nuntil B.C. 426, when the Athenians, after having purified the island\r\nin the winter of that year, restored the ancient solemnities, and\r\nadded horse-races, which had never before taken place at the Delia.\r\nAfter this restoration, Athens, being at the head of the Ionian\r\nconfederacy, took the most prominent part in the celebration of the\r\nDelia; and though the islanders, in common with Athens, provided\r\nthe choruses and victims, the leader (ἀρχιθέωρος), who conducted\r\nthe whole solemnity, was an Athenian, and the Athenians had the\r\nsuperintendence of the common sanctuary. From these solemnities,\r\nbelonging to the great Delian panegyris, we must distinguish the\r\n_lesser Delia_, which were mentioned above, and which were celebrated\r\nevery year, probably on the 6th of Thargelion. The Athenians on\r\nthis occasion sent the sacred vessel (θεωρίς), which the priest of\r\nApollo adorned with laurel branches, to Delos. The embassy was called\r\nθεωρία; and those who sailed to the island, θεωροί; and before they\r\nset sail a solemn sacrifice was offered in the Delion, at Marathon,\r\nin order to obtain a happy voyage. During the absence of the vessel\r\nthe city of Athens was purified, and no criminal was allowed to be\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELPHĪNĬA (δελφίνια), a festival of the same expiatory character as\r\nthe Apollonia, which was celebrated in various towns of Greece, in\r\nhonour of Apollo, surnamed Delphinius.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELPHIS (δελφίς), an instrument of naval warfare. It consisted of a\r\nlarge mass of iron or lead suspended on a beam, which projected from\r\nthe mast of the ship like a yard-arm. It was used to sink, or make a\r\nhole in, an enemy’s vessel, by being dropped upon it when alongside.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒLŪBRUM. [TEMPLUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒMARCHI (δήμαρχοι), officers, who were the head-boroughs or chief\r\nmagistrates of the demi in Attica, and are said to have been first\r\nappointed by Cleisthenes. Their duties were various and important.\r\nThus, they convened meetings of the demus, and took the votes upon\r\nall questions under consideration; they made and kept a register of\r\nthe landed estates in their districts, levied the monies due to the\r\ndemus for rent, &c. They succeeded to the functions which had been\r\ndischarged by the _naucrari_ of the old constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒMENSUM, an allowance of corn, given to Roman slaves monthly or\r\ndaily. It usually consisted of four or five modii of corn a month.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒMĬNŪTIO CĂPĬTIS. [CAPUT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒMĬURGI (δημιουργοί), magistrates, whose title is expressive of\r\ntheir doing the service of the people, existed in several of the\r\nPeloponnesian states. Among the Eleans and Mantineans they seem to\r\nhave been the chief executive magistracy. We also read of _demiurgi_\r\nin the Achaean league, who probably ranked next to the _strategi_,\r\nand put questions to the vote in the general assembly of the\r\nconfederates. Officers named _epidemiurgi_, or upper demiurgi, were\r\nsent by the Corinthians to manage the government of their colony at\r\nPotidaea.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒMŎCRĂTĬA (δημοκρατία), that form of constitution in which the\r\nsovereign political power is in the hands of the demus (δῆμος) or\r\ncommonalty. In a passage of Herodotus (iii. 80), the characteristics\r\nof a democracy are specified to be--1. Equality of legal rights\r\n(ἰσονομίη). 2. The appointment of magistrates by lot. 3. The\r\naccountability of all magistrates and officers. 4. The reference\r\nof all public matters to the decision of the community at large.\r\nAristotle remarks--“The following points are characteristic of a\r\ndemocracy; that all magistrates should be chosen out of the whole\r\nbody of citizens; that all should rule each, and each in turn rule\r\nall; that either all magistracies, or those not requiring experience\r\nand professional knowledge, should be assigned by lot; that there\r\nshould be no property qualification, or but a very small one, for\r\nfilling any magistracy; that the same man should not fill the same\r\noffice twice, or should fill offices but few times, and but few\r\noffices, except in the case of military commands; that all, or as\r\nmany as possible of the magistracies, should be of brief duration;\r\nthat all citizens should be qualified to serve as dicasts; that the\r\nsupreme power in everything should reside in the public assembly,\r\nand that no magistrate should be entrusted with irresponsible power\r\nexcept in very small matters.” It is somewhat curious that neither\r\nin practice nor in theory did the representative system attract any\r\nattention among the Greeks. That diseased form of a democracy, in\r\nwhich from the practice of giving pay to the poorer citizens for\r\ntheir attendance in the public assembly, and from other causes,\r\nthe predominant party in the state came to be in fact the lowest\r\nclass of the citizens, was by later writers termed an _Ochlocracy_\r\n(ὀχλοκρατία--the dominion of the mob).\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒMŎSĬI (δημόσιοι), public slaves at Athens, who were purchased by\r\nthe state. The public slaves, most frequently mentioned, formed\r\nthe city guard; it was their duty to preserve order in the public\r\nassembly, and to remove any person whom the prytaneis might order.\r\nThey are generally called bowmen (τοξόται); or from the native\r\ncountry of the majority, Scythians (Σκύθαι); and also Speusinians,\r\nfrom the name of the person who first established the force. They\r\noriginally lived in tents in the market-place, and afterwards upon\r\nthe Areiopagus. Their officers had the name of toxarchs (τόξαρχοι).\r\nTheir number was at first 300, purchased soon after the battle of\r\nSalamis, but was afterwards increased to 1200.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒMUS (δῆμος), originally indicated a district or tract of land;\r\nand in this meaning of a country district, inhabited and under\r\ncultivation, it is contrasted with πόλις. When Cleisthenes, at\r\nAthens, broke up the four tribes of the old constitution, he\r\nsubstituted in their place ten local tribes (φυλαὶ τοπικαί),\r\neach of which he subdivided into ten _demi_ or country parishes,\r\npossessing each its principal town; and in some one of these demi\r\nwere enrolled all the Athenian citizens resident in Attica, with\r\nthe exception, perhaps, of those who were natives of Athens itself.\r\nThese subdivisions corresponded in some degree to the _naucrariae_\r\n(ναυκραρίαι) of the old tribes, and were originally one hundred in\r\nnumber. These demi formed independent corporations, and had each\r\ntheir several magistrates, landed and other property, with a common\r\ntreasury. They had likewise their respective convocations or “parish\r\nmeetings,” convened by the _demarchi_, in which was transacted the\r\npublic business of the demus, such as the leasing of its estates,\r\nthe elections of officers, the revision of the registers or lists\r\nof δημόται, and the admission of new members. Independent of these\r\nbonds of union, each demus seems to have had its peculiar temples and\r\nreligious worship. There were likewise judges, called δικασταὶ κατα\r\nδημους, who decided cases where the matter in dispute was of less\r\nvalue than ten drachmae. Admission into a demus was necessary before\r\nany individual could enter upon his full rights and privileges as\r\nan Attic citizen. The register of enrolment was called ληξιαρχικὸν\r\nγραμματεῖον.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒNĀRĬUS, the principal silver coin among the Romans, was so called\r\nbecause it was originally equal to ten asses; but on the reduction\r\nof the weight of the as [AS], it was made equal to sixteen asses,\r\nexcept in military pay, in which it was still reckoned as equal to\r\nten asses. The denarius was first coined five years before the first\r\nPunic war, B.C. 269. [ARGENTUM.] The average value of the denarii\r\ncoined at the end of the commonwealth is about 8½_d._, and those\r\nunder the empire about 7½_d._ If the denarius be reckoned in value\r\n8½_d._, the other Roman coins of silver will be of the following\r\nvalue:\r\n\r\n                            | Pence. |  Farth.\r\n                            |        |\r\n  Teruncius                 |   --   |   ·53125\r\n  Sembella                  |   --   |  1·0625\r\n  Libella                   |   --   |  2·125\r\n  Sestertius                |    2   |   ·5\r\n  Quinarius or Victoriatus  |    4   |  1\r\n  Denarius                  |    8   |  2\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denarius. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nSome denarii were called _serrati_, because their edges were notched\r\nlike a saw, which appears to have been done to prove that they were\r\nsolid silver, and not plated; and others _bigati_ and _quadrigati_,\r\nbecause on their reverse were represented chariots drawn by two and\r\nfour horses respectively.\r\n\r\nDĒSIGNĀTOR. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĒSULTOR, a rider in the Roman games, who generally rode two horses\r\nat the same time, sitting on them without a saddle, and vaulting upon\r\neither of them at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĔUNX. [As, LIBRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEXTANS. [As, LIBRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬĂDĒMA, originally a white fillet, used to encircle the head. It is\r\nrepresented on the head of Dionysus, and was, in an ornamented form,\r\nassumed by kings as an emblem of sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬAETĒTAE (διαιτηταί), or arbitrators, at Athens, were of two kinds;\r\nthe one public and appointed by lot (κληρωτοί), the other private,\r\nand chosen (αἱρετοί) by the parties who referred to them the decision\r\nof a disputed point, instead of trying it before a court of justice;\r\nthe judgments of both, according to Aristotle, being founded on\r\nequity rather than law. The number of public arbitrators seems to\r\nhave been 40, four for each tribe. Their jurisdiction was confined to\r\ncivil cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬĀLIS FLĀMEN. [FLAMEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬĂMASTĪGŌSIS (διαμαστίγωσις), a solemnity performed at Sparta at\r\nthe festival of Artemis Orthia. Spartan youths were scourged on\r\nthe occasion at the altar of Artemis, by persons appointed for the\r\npurpose, until their blood gushed forth and covered the altar. Many\r\nanecdotes are related of the courage and intrepidity with which young\r\nSpartans bore the lashes of the scourge; some even died without\r\nuttering a murmur at their sufferings, for to die under the strokes\r\nwas considered as honourable a death as that on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬĂPSĔPHĬSIS (διαψήφισις), a political institution at Athens, the\r\nobject of which was to prevent aliens, or such as were the offspring\r\nof an unlawful marriage, from assuming the rights of citizens. By\r\nthis method a trial of spurious citizens was to be held by the\r\ndemotae, within whose deme intruders were suspected to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĪĂSĬA (διάσια), a great festival celebrated at Athens, without\r\nthe walls of the city, in honour of Zeus, surnamed Μειλίχιος. The\r\nwhole people took part in it, and the wealthier citizens offered\r\nvictims, while the poorer classes burnt such incense as their country\r\nfurnished. The diasia took place in the latter half of the month of\r\nAnthesterion with feasting and rejoicings, and was, like most other\r\nfestivals, accompanied by a fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬCASTĒS (δικαστής), the name of a judge, or rather juryman, at\r\nAthens. The conditions of his eligibility were, that he should be a\r\nfree citizen, in the enjoyment of his full franchise (ἐπιτιμία), and\r\nnot less than thirty years of age, and of persons so qualified 6,000\r\nwere selected by lot for the service of every year. Their appointment\r\ntook place annually under the conduct of the nine archons and their\r\nofficial scribe; each of these ten personages drew by lot the names\r\nof 600 persons of the tribe assigned to him; the whole number so\r\nselected was again divided by lot into ten sections of 500 each,\r\ntogether with a supernumerary one, consisting of 1000 persons, from\r\namong whom the occasional deficiencies in the sections of 500 might\r\nbe supplied. To each of the ten sections one of the ten first letters\r\nof the alphabet was appropriated as a distinguishing mark, and a\r\nsmall tablet (πινάκιον), inscribed with the letter of the section\r\nand the name of the individual, was delivered as a certificate of\r\nhis appointment to each dicast. Before proceeding to the exercise of\r\nhis functions, the dicast was obliged to swear the official oath.\r\nThis oath being taken, and the divisions made as above mentioned, it\r\nremained to assign the courts to the several sections of dicasts in\r\nwhich they were to sit. This was not, like the first, an appointment\r\nintended to last during the year, but took place under the conduct\r\nof the thesmothetae, _de novo_, every time that it was necessary\r\nto impanel a number of dicasts. As soon as the allotment had taken\r\nplace, each dicast received a staff, on which was painted the letter\r\nand the colour of the court awarded him, which might serve both as a\r\nticket to procure admittance, and also to distinguish him from any\r\nloiterer that might endeavour clandestinely to obtain a sitting after\r\nbusiness had begun. While in court, and probably from the hand of\r\nthe presiding magistrate (ἡγέμων δικαστηρίου), he received the token\r\nor ticket that entitled him to receive his fee (δικαστικόν). This\r\npayment is said to have been first instituted by Pericles, and was\r\noriginally a single obolus; it was increased by Cleon to thrice that\r\namount about the 88th Olympiad.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬCĒ (δίκη), signifies generally any proceedings at law by one\r\nparty directly or mediately against others. The object of all\r\nsuch actions is to protect the body politic, or one or more of\r\nits individual members, from injury and aggression; a distinction\r\nwhich has in most countries suggested the division of all causes\r\ninto two great classes, the public and the private, and assigned to\r\neach its peculiar form and treatment. At Athens the first of these\r\nwas implied by the terms public δίκαι, or ἀγῶνες, or still more\r\npeculiarly by γραφαί; causes of the other class were termed private\r\nδίκαι, or ἀγῶνες, or simply δίκαι in its limited sense. In a δίκη,\r\nonly the person whose rights were alleged to be affected, or the\r\nlegal protector (κύριος) of such person, if a minor or otherwise\r\nincapable of appearing _suo jure_, was permitted to institute an\r\naction as plaintiff; in public causes, with the exception of some few\r\nin which the person injured or his family were peculiarly bound and\r\ninterested to act, any free citizen, and sometimes, when the state\r\nwas directly attacked, almost any alien, was empowered to do so.\r\nThe court fees, called _prytaneia_, were paid in private but not in\r\npublic causes, and a public prosecutor that compromised the action\r\nwith the defendant was in most cases punished by a fine of a thousand\r\ndrachmae and a modified disfranchisement, while there was no legal\r\nimpediment at any period of a private lawsuit to the reconciliation\r\nof the litigant parties.--The proceedings in the δίκη were commenced\r\nby a summons (πρόσκλησις) to the defendant to appear on a certain\r\nday before the proper magistrate (εἰσαγωγεύς), and there answer\r\nthe charges preferred against him. This summons was often served\r\nby the plaintiff in person, accompanied by one or two witnesses\r\n(κλητῆρες), whose names were endorsed upon the declaration (λῆξις\r\nor ἔγκλημα). Between the service of the summons and appearance of\r\nthe parties before the magistrate, it is very probable that the law\r\nprescribed the intervention of a period of five days. If both parties\r\nappeared, the proceedings commenced by the plaintiff putting in his\r\ndeclaration, and at the same time depositing his share of the court\r\nfees (πρυτανεῖα), which were trifling in amount, but the non-payment\r\nof which was a fatal objection to the further progress of a cause.\r\nWhen these were paid, it became the duty of the magistrate, if no\r\nmanifest objection appeared on the face of the declaration, to cause\r\nit to be written out on a tablet, and exposed for the inspection\r\nof the public on the wall or other place that served as the cause\r\nlist of his court. The magistrate then appointed a day for the\r\nfurther proceedings of the _anacrisis_ [ANACRISIS]. If the plaintiff\r\nfailed to appear at the anacrisis, the suit, of course, fell to\r\nthe ground; if the defendant made default, judgment passed against\r\nhim. An affidavit might at this, as well as at other periods of the\r\naction, be made in behalf of a person unable to attend upon the\r\ngiven day, and this would, if allowed, have the effect of postponing\r\nfurther proceedings (ὑπωμοσία); it might, however, be combated by\r\na counter-affidavit, to the effect that the alleged reason was\r\nunfounded or otherwise insufficient (ἀνθυπωμοσία); and a question\r\nwould arise upon this point, the decision of which, when adverse to\r\nthe defendant, would render him liable to the penalty of contumacy.\r\nThe plaintiff was in this case said ἐρήμην ἑλεῖν; the defendant,\r\nἐρήμην ὀφλεῖν, δίκην being the word omitted in both phrases. The\r\nanacrisis began with the affidavit of the plaintiff (προωμοσία),\r\nthen followed the answer of the defendant (ἀντωμοσία or ἀντιγραφή),\r\nthen the parties produced their respective witnesses, and reduced\r\ntheir evidence to writing, and put in originals, or authenticated\r\ncopies, of all the records, deeds, and contracts that might be\r\nuseful in establishing their case, as well as memoranda of offers\r\nand requisitions then made by either side (προκλήσεις). The whole of\r\nthe documents were then, if the cause took a straightforward course\r\n(εὐθυδικία), enclosed on the last day of the anacrisis in a casket\r\n(ἐχῖνος), which was sealed, and entrusted to the custody of the\r\npresiding magistrate, till it was produced and opened at the trial.\r\nDuring the interval no alteration in its contents was permitted, and\r\naccordingly evidence that had been discovered after the anacrisis\r\nwas not producible at the trial.--In some causes, the trial before\r\nthe dicasts was by law appointed to come on within a given time; in\r\nsuch as were not provided for by such regulations, we may suppose\r\nthat it would principally depend upon the leisure of the magistrate.\r\nUpon the court being assembled, the magistrate called on the cause,\r\nand the plaintiff opened his case. At the commencement of the speech,\r\nthe proper officer (ὁ ἐφ’ ὕδωρ) filled the clepsydra with water. As\r\nlong as the water flowed from this vessel the orator was permitted\r\nto speak; if, however, evidence was to be read by the officer of\r\nthe court, or a law recited, the water was stopped till the speaker\r\nrecommenced. The quantity of water, or, in other words, the length\r\nof the speeches, was different in different causes. After the\r\nspeeches of the advocates, which were in general two on each side,\r\nand the incidental reading of the documentary and other evidence,\r\nthe dicasts proceeded to give their judgment by ballot.--When the\r\nprincipal point at issue was decided in favour of the plaintiff,\r\nthere followed in many cases a further discussion as to the fine or\r\npunishment to be inflicted on the defendant (παθεῖν ἢ ἀποτῖσαι). All\r\nactions were divided into two classes,--ἀγῶνες ἀτίμητοι, _suits not\r\nto be assessed_, in which the fine, or other penalty, was determined\r\nby the laws; and ἀγῶνες τιμητοί, _suits to be assessed_, in which\r\nthe penalty had to be fixed by the judges. If the suit was an ἀγῶν\r\nτιμητος, the plaintiff generally mentioned in the pleadings the\r\npunishment which he considered the defendant deserved (τίμημα); and\r\nthe defendant was allowed to make a counter-assessment (ἀντιτιμᾶσθαι\r\nor ὑποτιμᾶσθαι), and to argue before the judges why the assessment of\r\nthe plaintiff ought to be changed or mitigated. In certain causes,\r\nwhich were determined by the laws, any of the judges was allowed\r\nto propose an additional assessment (προστίμημα); the amount of\r\nwhich, however, appears to have been usually fixed by the laws.\r\nThus, in certain cases of theft, the additional penalty was fixed\r\nat five days’ and nights’ imprisonment. Upon judgment being given\r\nin a private suit, the Athenian law left its execution very much in\r\nthe hands of the successful party, who was empowered to seize the\r\nmoveables of his antagonist as a pledge for the payment of the money,\r\nor institute an action of ejectment (ἐξούλης) against the refractory\r\ndebtor. The judgment of a court of dicasts was in general decisive\r\n(δίκη αὐτοτελής); but upon certain occasions, as, for instance,\r\nwhen a gross case of perjury or conspiracy could be proved by the\r\nunsuccessful party to have operated to his disadvantage, the cause,\r\nupon the conviction of such conspirators or witnesses, might be\r\ncommenced _de novo_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDICTĀTOR, an extraordinary magistrate at Rome. The name is of\r\nLatin origin, and the office probably existed in many Latin towns\r\nbefore it was introduced into Rome. We find it in Lanuvium even\r\nin very late times. At Rome this magistrate was originally called\r\n_magister populi_ and not _dictator_, and in the sacred books he\r\nwas always designated by the former name down to the latest times.\r\nOn the establishment of the Roman republic the government of the\r\nstate was entrusted to two consuls, that the citizens might be the\r\nbetter protected against the tyrannical exercise of the supreme\r\npower. But it was soon felt that circumstances might arise in\r\nwhich it was of importance for the safety of the state that the\r\ngovernment should be vested in the hands of a single person, who\r\nshould possess for a season absolute power, and from whose decision\r\nthere should be no appeal to any other body. Thus it came to pass\r\nthat in B.C. 501, nine years after the expulsion of the Tarquins,\r\nthe dictatorship (_dictatura_) was instituted. By the original law\r\nrespecting the appointment of a dictator (_lex de dictatore creando_)\r\nno one was eligible for this office unless he had previously been\r\nconsul. We find, however, a few instances in which this law was not\r\nobserved.--When a dictator was considered necessary, the senate\r\npassed a senatus consultum, that one of the consuls should nominate\r\n(_dicere_) a dictator; and without a previous decree of the senate\r\nthe consuls had not the power of naming a dictator. The nomination or\r\nproclamation of the dictator was always made by the consul, probably\r\nwithout any witnesses, between midnight and morning, and with the\r\nobservance of the auspices (_surgens_ or _oriens nocte silentio\r\ndictatorem dicebat_). The technical word for this nomination or\r\nproclamation was _dicere_ (seldom _creare_ or _facere_). Originally\r\nthe dictator was of course a patrician. The first plebeian dictator\r\nwas C. Marcius Rutilus, nominated in B.C. 356 by the plebeian consul\r\nM. Popillius Laenas. The reasons which led to the appointment of\r\na dictator, required that there should be only one at a time. The\r\ndictators that were appointed for carrying on the business of the\r\nstate were said to be nominated _rei gerundae causa_, or sometimes\r\n_seditionis sedandae causa_; and upon them, as well as upon the\r\nother magistrates, the imperium was conferred by a _Lex Curiata_.\r\nThe dictatorship was limited to six months, and no instances occur\r\nin which a person held this office for a longer time, for the\r\ndictatorships of Sulla and Caesar are of course not to be taken into\r\naccount. On the contrary, though a dictator was appointed for six\r\nmonths, he often resigned his office long previously, immediately\r\nafter he had dispatched the business for which he had been appointed.\r\nAs soon as the dictator was nominated, a kind of suspension took\r\nplace with respect to the consuls and all the other magistrates,\r\nwith the exception of the tribuni plebis. The regular magistrates\r\ncontinued, indeed, to discharge the duties of their various offices\r\nunder the dictator, but they were no longer independent officers,\r\nbut were subject to the higher imperium of the dictator, and obliged\r\nto obey his orders in every thing. The superiority of the dictator’s\r\npower to that of the consuls consisted chiefly in the three following\r\npoints--greater independence of the senate, more extensive power of\r\npunishment without any appeal (_provocatio_) from their sentence\r\nto the people, and irresponsibility. To these three points, must\r\nof course be added that he was not fettered by a colleague. We may\r\nnaturally suppose that the dictator would usually act in unison with\r\nthe senate; but it is expressly stated that in many cases where the\r\nconsuls required the co-operation of the senate, the dictator could\r\nact on his own responsibility. That there was originally no appeal\r\nfrom the sentence of the dictator is certain, and accordingly the\r\nlictors bore the axes in the fasces before them even in the city,\r\nas a symbol of their absolute power over the lives of the citizens,\r\nalthough by the Valerian law the axes had disappeared from the fasces\r\nof the consuls. Whether, however, the right of _provocatio_ was\r\nafterwards given cannot be determined. It was in consequence of the\r\ngreat and irresponsible power possessed by the dictatorship, that we\r\nfind it frequently compared with the regal dignity, from which it\r\nonly differed in being held for a limited time.--There were however\r\na few limits to the power of the dictator. 1. The most important was\r\nthat which we have mentioned above, that the period of his office was\r\nonly six months. 2. He had not power over the treasury, but could\r\nonly make use of the money which was granted him by the senate. 3.\r\nHe was not allowed to leave Italy, since he might thus easily become\r\ndangerous to the republic; though the case of Atilius Calatinus in\r\nthe first Punic war forms an exception to this rule. 4. He was not\r\nallowed to ride on horseback at Rome, without previously obtaining\r\nthe permission of the people; a regulation apparently capricious,\r\nbut perhaps adopted that he might not bear too great a resemblance\r\nto the kings, who were accustomed to ride.--The insignia of the\r\ndictator were nearly the same as those of the kings in earlier times;\r\nand of the consuls subsequently. Instead however of having only\r\ntwelve lictors, as was the case with the consuls, he was preceded by\r\ntwenty-four bearing the secures as well as the fasces. The _sella\r\ncurulis_ and _toga praetexta_ also belonged to the dictator.--The\r\npreceding account of the dictatorship applies more particularly to\r\nthe dictator rei gerundae causa; but dictators were also frequently\r\nappointed, especially when the consuls were absent from the city,\r\nto perform certain acts, which could not be done by any inferior\r\nmagistrate. These dictators had little more than the name; and as\r\nthey were only appointed to discharge a particular duty, they had to\r\nresign immediately that duty was performed. The occasions on which\r\nsuch dictators were appointed, were principally:--1. For the purpose\r\nof holding the comitia for the elections (_comitiorum habendorum\r\ncausa_). 2. For fixing the _clavus annalis_ in the temple of Jupiter\r\n(_clavi figendi causa_) in times of pestilence or civil discord,\r\nbecause the law said that this ceremony was to be performed by the\r\n_praetor maximus_, and after the institution of the dictatorship\r\nthe latter was regarded as the highest magistracy in the state. 3.\r\nFor appointing holidays (_feriarum constituendarum causa_) on the\r\nappearance of prodigies, and for officiating at the public games\r\n(_ludorum faciendorum causa_), the presidency of which belonged\r\nto the consuls or praetors. 4. For holding trials (_quaestionibus\r\nexercendis_.) 5. And on one occasion, for filling up vacancies in\r\nthe senate (_legendo senatui_).--Along with the dictator there was\r\nalways a _magister equitum_, the nomination of whom was left to the\r\nchoice of the dictator, unless the senatus consultum specified,\r\nas was sometimes the case, the name of the person who was to be\r\nappointed. The magister equitum had, like the dictator, to receive\r\nthe imperium by a lex curiata. The dictator could not be without\r\na magister equitum, and, consequently, if the latter died during\r\nthe six months of the dictatorship, another had to be nominated\r\nin his stead. The magister equitum was subject to the imperium of\r\nthe dictator, but in the absence of his superior he became his\r\nrepresentative, and exercised the same powers as the dictator. The\r\nmagister equitum was originally, as his name imports, the commander\r\nof the cavalry, while the dictator was at the head of the legions,\r\nthe infantry; and the relation between them was in this respect\r\nsimilar to that which subsisted between the king and the tribunus\r\ncelerum. Dictators were only appointed so long as the Romans had\r\nto carry on wars in Italy. A solitary instance of the nomination\r\nof a dictator for the purpose of carrying on war out of Italy has\r\nbeen already mentioned. The last dictator rei gerundae causa was M.\r\nJunius Pera, in B.C. 216. From that time dictators were frequently\r\nappointed for holding the elections down to B.C. 202, but after\r\nthat year the dictatorship disappears altogether.--After a lapse of\r\n120 years, Sulla caused himself to be appointed dictator in B.C.\r\n82, _reipublicae constituendae causa_, but neither his dictatorship\r\nnor that of Caesar is to be compared with the genuine office. Soon\r\nafter Caesar’s death the dictatorship was abolished for ever by a\r\nlex proposed by the consul Antonius. During the time, however, that\r\nthe dictatorship was in abeyance, a substitute was invented for it,\r\nwhenever the circumstances of the republic required the adoption of\r\nextraordinary measures, by the senate investing the consuls with\r\ndictatorial power. This was done by the well-known formula, _Videant_\r\nor _dent operam consules, ne quid respublica detrimenti capiat_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDICTYNNĬA (δικτύννια), a festival with sacrifices, celebrated\r\nat Cydonia in Crete, in honour of Artemis, surnamed Δίκτυννα or\r\nΔικτύνναια, from δίκτυον, a hunter’s net.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬES (ἡμέρα), a day. The name _dies_ was applied, like our word day,\r\nto the time during which, according to the notions of the ancients,\r\nthe sun performed his course around the earth, and this time they\r\ncalled the civil day (_dies civilis_, in Greek νυχθήμερον, because\r\nit included both night and day). The natural day (_dies naturalis_),\r\nor the time from the rising to the setting of the sun, was likewise\r\ndesignated by the name dies. The civil day began with the Greeks\r\nat the setting of the sun, and with the Romans at midnight. At the\r\ntime of the Homeric poems the natural day was divided into three\r\nparts. The first, called ἠώς, began with sunrise, and comprehended\r\nthe whole space of time during which light seemed to be increasing,\r\n_i.e._ till mid-day. The second part was called μέσον ἦμαρ or mid-day,\r\nduring which the sun was thought to stand still. The third part bore\r\nthe name of δείλη or δείελον ἦμαρ, which derived its name from the\r\nincreased warmth of the atmosphere. Among the Athenians the first\r\nand last of the divisions made at the time of Homer were afterwards\r\nsubdivided into two parts. The earlier part of the morning was termed\r\nπρωΐ or πρῲ τῆς ἡμέρας: the latter, πληθούσης τῆς ἀγορᾶς, or περὶ\r\nπλήθουσαν ἀγοράν. The μέσον ἦμαρ of Homer was afterwards expressed\r\nby μεσημβρία, μέσον ἡμέρας, or μέση ἡμέρα, and comprehended, as\r\nbefore, the middle of the day, when the sun seemed neither to rise\r\nnor to decline. The two parts of the afternoon were called δείλη\r\nπρωΐη or πρωΐα, and δείλη ὀψίη or ὀψία. This division continued to\r\nbe observed down to the latest period of Grecian history, though\r\nanother more accurate division was introduced at an early period;\r\nfor Anaximander, or, according to others, his disciple Anaximenes,\r\nis said to have made the Greeks acquainted with the use of the\r\nBabylonian chronometer or sun-dial (called πόλος, or ὡρολόγιον), by\r\nmeans of which the natural day was divided into twelve equal spaces\r\nof time. The division of the day most generally observed by the\r\nRomans, was that into _tempus antemeridianum_ and _pomeridianum_,\r\nthe _meridies_ itself being only considered as a point at which the\r\none ended and the other commenced. But as it was of importance that\r\nthis moment should be known, an especial officer [ACCENSUS] was\r\nappointed, who proclaimed the time of mid-day. The division of the\r\nday into twelve equal spaces, which were shorter in winter than in\r\nsummer, was first adopted when artificial means of measuring time\r\nwere introduced among the Romans from Greece. This was about the\r\nyear B.C. 291, when L. Papirius Cursor, after the war with Pyrrhus\r\nin southern Italy, brought to Rome an instrument called _solarium\r\nhorologium_, or simply _solarium_. But as the solarium had been\r\nmade for a different latitude, it showed the time at Rome very\r\nincorrectly. Scipio Nasica, therefore, erected in B.C. 159 a public\r\nclepsydra, which indicated the hours of the night as well as of the\r\nday. Even after the erection of this clepsydra it was customary\r\nfor one of the subordinate officers of the praetor to proclaim the\r\nthird, sixth, and ninth hours; which shows that the day was, like the\r\nnight, divided into four parts, each consisting of three hours.--All\r\nthe days of the year were, according to different points of view,\r\ndivided by the Romans into different classes. For the purpose of the\r\nadministration of justice all days were divided into _dies fasti_\r\nand _dies nefasti_. DIES FASTI were the days on which the praetor\r\nwas allowed to administer justice in the public courts; they derived\r\ntheir name from _fari_ (_fari tria verba_; _do_, _dico_, _addico_).\r\nOn some of the dies fasti comitia could be held, but not on all. The\r\nregular _dies fasti_ were marked in the Roman calendar by the letter\r\nF, and their number in the course of the year was 38.--Besides these\r\nthere were certain days called _dies intercisi_, on which the praetor\r\nmight hold his courts, but not at all hours, so that sometimes one\r\nhalf of such a day was _fastus_, while the other half was _nefastus_.\r\nTheir number was 65 in the year.--DIES NEFASTI were days on which\r\nneither courts of justice nor comitia were allowed to be held, and\r\nwhich were dedicated to other purposes. The term _dies nefasti_,\r\nwhich originally had nothing to do with religion, but simply\r\nindicated days on which no courts were to be held, was in subsequent\r\ntimes applied to religious days in general, as _dies nefasti_ were\r\nmostly dedicated to the worship of the gods.--In a religious point\r\nof view all days of the year were either _dies festi_, or _dies\r\nprofesti_, or _dies intercisi_. According to the definition given by\r\nMacrobius, _dies festi_ were dedicated to the gods, and spent with\r\nsacrifices, repasts, games, and other solemnities; _dies profesti_\r\nbelonged to men for the administration of their private and public\r\naffairs. _Dies intercisi_ were common between gods and men, that is,\r\npartly devoted to the worship of the gods, partly to the transaction\r\nof ordinary business. _Dies profesti_ were either _dies fasti_, or\r\n_dies comitiales_, that is, days on which comitia were held, or _dies\r\ncomperendini_, that is, days to which any action was allowed to be\r\ntransferred; or _dies stati_, that is, days set apart for causes\r\nbetween Roman citizens and foreigners; or _dies proeliales_, that is,\r\nall days on which religion did not forbid the commencement of a war.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFARRĔĀTĬO. [DIVORTIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬĬPŎLEIA (διιπόλεια), also called Διπόλεια or Διπόλια, a very ancient\r\nfestival celebrated every year on the acropolis of Athens in honour\r\nof Zeus, surnamed Πολιεύς.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬMĂCHAE (διμάχαι), Macedonian horse-soldiers, who also fought on\r\nfoot when occasion required, like our dragoons.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĪMĬNŪTĬO CĂPĬTIS. [CAPUT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬŎCLEIA (διόκλεια), a festival celebrated by the Megarians in honour\r\nof an ancient Athenian hero, Diocles, around whose grave young men\r\nassembled on the occasion, and amused themselves with gymnastic and\r\nother contests. We read that he who gave the sweetest kiss obtained\r\nthe prize, consisting of a garland of flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬŎNȲSĬA (διονύσια), festivals celebrated in various parts of Greece\r\nin honour of Dionysus, and characterised by extravagant merriment\r\nand enthusiastic joy. Drunkenness, and the boisterous music of\r\nflutes, cymbals, and drums, were likewise common to all Dionysiac\r\nfestivals. In the processions called θίασοι (from θείαζω), with\r\nwhich they were celebrated, women also took part in the disguise\r\nof Bacchae, Lenae, Thyades, Naiades, Nymphs, &c., adorned with\r\ngarlands of ivy, and bearing the thyrsus in their hands, so that\r\nthe whole train represented a population inspired, and actuated by\r\nthe powerful presence of the god. The choruses sung on the occasion\r\nwere called dithyrambs, and were hymns addressed to the god in the\r\nfreest metres and with the boldest imagery, in which his exploits\r\nand achievements were extolled. [CHORUS.] The phallus, the symbol\r\nof the fertility of nature, was also carried in these processions.\r\nThe indulgence in drinking was considered by the Greeks as a duty\r\nof gratitude which they owed to the giver of the vine; hence in\r\nsome places it was thought a crime to remain sober at the Dionysia.\r\nThe Attic festivals of Dionysus were four in number: the _Rural_ or\r\n_Lesser Dionysia_ (Διονύσια κατ’ ἀγρούς, or μικρά), the _Lenaea_\r\n(Λήναια), the _Anthesteria_ (Ἀνθεστήρια), and the _City_ or _Great\r\nDionysia_ (Διονύσια ἐν ἄστει, ἀστικά, or μεγάλα). The season of\r\nthe year sacred to Dionysus was during the months nearest to the\r\nshortest day; and the Attic festivals were accordingly celebrated\r\nin Poseideon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, and Elaphebolion.--The _Rural_\r\nor _Lesser Dionysia_, a vintage festival, were celebrated in the\r\nvarious demes of Attica in the month of Poseideon, and were under\r\nthe superintendence of the several local magistrates, the demarchs.\r\nThis was doubtless the most ancient of all, and was held with the\r\nhighest degree of merriment and freedom; even slaves enjoyed full\r\nfreedom during its celebration, and their boisterous shouts on the\r\noccasion were almost intolerable. It is here that we have to seek\r\nfor the origin of comedy, in the jests and the scurrilous abuse with\r\nwhich the peasants assailed the bystanders from a waggon in which\r\nthey rode about. The Dionysia in the Peiraeeus, as well as those of\r\nthe other demes of Attica, belonged to the lesser Dionysia.--The\r\nsecond festival, the _Lenaea_ (from ληνός, the wine-press, from which\r\nalso the month of Gamelion was called by the Ionians Lenaeon), was\r\ncelebrated in the month of Gamelion; the place of its celebration\r\nwas the ancient temple of Dionysus Limnaeus (from λίμνη, as the\r\ndistrict was originally a swamp). This temple was called the Lenaeon.\r\nThe Lenaea were celebrated with a procession and scenic contests in\r\ntragedy and comedy. The procession probably went to the Lenaeon,\r\nwhere a goat (τράγος, whence the chorus and tragedy which arose out\r\nof it were called τραγικὸς χορός, and τραγῳδία) was sacrificed, and a\r\nchorus standing around the altar sang the dithyrambic ode to the god.\r\nAs the dithyramb was the element out of which, by the introduction of\r\nan actor, tragedy arose [CHORUS], it is natural that, in the scenic\r\ncontests of this festival, tragedy should have preceded comedy. The\r\npoet who wished his play to be brought out at the Lenaea applied to\r\nthe second archon, who had the superintendence of this festival, and\r\nwho gave him a chorus if the piece was thought to deserve it.--The\r\nthird festival, the _Anthesteria_, was celebrated on the 11th,\r\n12th, and 13th days of the month of Anthesterion. The second archon\r\nlikewise superintended the celebration of the Anthesteria, and\r\ndistributed the prizes among the victors in the various games which\r\nwere carried on during the season. The first day was called πιθοιγία:\r\nthe second, χόες: and the third, χύτροι. The first day derived its\r\nname from the opening of the casks to taste the wine of the preceding\r\nyear; the second from χοῦς, the cup, and seems to have been the day\r\ndevoted to drinking. The third day had its name from χύτρος, a pot,\r\nas on this day persons offered pots with flowers, seeds, or cooked\r\nvegetables, as a sacrifice to Dionysus and Hermes Chthonius. It is\r\nuncertain whether dramas were performed at the Anthesteria; but it\r\nis supposed that comedies were represented, and that tragedies which\r\nwere to be brought out at the great Dionysia were perhaps rehearsed\r\nat the Anthesteria. The mysteries connected with the celebration\r\nof the Anthesteria were held at night.--The fourth festival, the\r\n_City_ or _Great Dionysia_, was celebrated about the 12th of the\r\nmonth of Elaphebolion; but we do not know whether they lasted more\r\nthan one day or not. The order in which the solemnities took place\r\nwas as follows:--the great public procession, the chorus of boys,\r\nthe _comus_ [CHORUS], comedy, and, lastly, tragedy. Of the dramas\r\nwhich were performed at the great Dionysia, the tragedies at least\r\nwere generally new pieces; repetitions do not, however, seem to have\r\nbeen excluded from any Dionysiac festival. The first archon had\r\nthe superintendence, and gave the chorus to the dramatic poet who\r\nwished to bring out his piece at this festival. The prize awarded to\r\nthe dramatist for the best play consisted of a crown, and his name\r\nwas proclaimed in the theatre of Dionysus. As the great Dionysia\r\nwere celebrated at the beginning of spring, when the navigation was\r\nre-opened, Athens was not only visited by numbers of country people,\r\nbut also by strangers from other parts of Greece, and the various\r\namusements and exhibitions on this occasion were not unlike those\r\nof a modern fair.--The worship of Dionysus, whom the Romans called\r\nBacchus, or rather the Bacchic mysteries and orgies (_Bacchanalia_),\r\nare said to have been introduced from southern Italy into Etruria,\r\nand from thence to Rome, where for a time they were carried on in\r\nsecret, and, during the latter period of their existence, at night.\r\nThe initiated, according to Livy, not only indulged in feasting and\r\ndrinking at their meetings, but when their minds were heated with\r\nwine they indulged in the coarsest excesses and the most unnatural\r\nvices. The time of initiation lasted ten days; on the tenth, the\r\nperson who was to be initiated took a solemn meal, underwent a\r\npurification by water, and was led into the sanctuary (_Bacchanal_).\r\nAt first only women were initiated, and the orgies were celebrated\r\nevery year during three days. But Pacula Annia, a Campanian matron,\r\npretending to act under the direct influence of Bacchus, changed the\r\nwhole method of celebration: she admitted men to the initiation,\r\nand transferred the solemnisation, which had hitherto taken place\r\nduring the daytime, to the night. Instead of three days in the year,\r\nshe ordered that the Bacchanalia should be held during five days in\r\nevery month. It was from that time that these orgies were carried\r\non with frightful licentiousness and excesses of every kind. The\r\nevil at length became so alarming, that, in B.C. 186, the consuls,\r\nby the command of the senate, instituted an investigation into the\r\nnature and object of these new rites. The result was that numerous\r\npersons were arrested, and some put to death; and that a decree of\r\nthe senate was issued, commanding that no Bacchanalia should be held\r\neither in Rome or Italy; that if any one should think such ceremonies\r\nnecessary, or if he could not neglect them without scruples or making\r\natonements, he should apply to the praetor urbanus, who might then\r\nconsult the senate. If the permission should be granted to him in\r\nan assembly of the senate, consisting of not less than one hundred\r\nmembers, he might solemnise the Bacchic sacra; but no more than five\r\npersons were to be present at the celebration; there should be no\r\ncommon fund, and no master of the sacra or priest. A brazen table\r\ncontaining this important document was discovered near Bari, in\r\nsouthern Italy, in the year 1640, and is at present in the imperial\r\nMuseum of Vienna. While the _Bacchanalia_ were thus suppressed,\r\nanother more simple and innocent festival of Bacchus, the _Liberalia_\r\n(from _Liber_, or _Liber Pater_, a name of Bacchus), continued to\r\nbe celebrated at Rome every year on the 16th of March. Priests and\r\naged priestesses, adorned with garlands of ivy, carried through the\r\ncity wine, honey, cakes, and sweetmeats, together with an altar with\r\na handle (_ansata ara_), in the middle of which there was a small\r\nfire-pan (_foculus_), in which from time to time sacrifices were\r\nburnt. On this day Roman youths who had attained their sixteenth year\r\nreceived the _toga virilis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬŎSCŪRĬA (διοσκούρια), festivals celebrated in various parts of\r\nGreece in honour of the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux). Their worship\r\nwas very generally adopted in Greece, especially in the Doric and\r\nAchaean states; but little is known of the manner in which their\r\nfestivals were celebrated. At Athens the festival was called Anaceia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬŌTA, a vessel having two ears (ὦτα) or handles, used for holding\r\nwine. It appears to have been much the same as the amphora. [AMPHORA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHTHĔRA (διφθέρα), a kind of cloak made of the skins of animals,\r\nand worn by herdsmen and country people. It had a covering for the\r\nhead (ἐπικράνον), in which respect it would correspond to the Roman\r\n_cucullus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPLŌMA, a writ or public document, which conferred upon a person\r\nany right or privilege. During the republic, it was granted by the\r\nconsuls and senate; and under the empire, by the emperor and the\r\nmagistrates whom he authorised to do so. It consisted of two leaves,\r\nwhence it derived its name.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPTỸCHA (δίπτυχα), two writing tablets, which could be folded\r\ntogether. They were commonly made of wood and covered over with wax.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĬRĬBĬTŌRES. [COMITIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUS (δίσκος), a circular plate of stone, or metal, made for\r\nthrowing to a distance as an exercise of strength and dexterity. It\r\nwas one of the principal gymnastic exercises of the ancients, being\r\nincluded in the _Pentathlum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Discobolus. (Osterley, Denk. der alt Kunst, vol. 1.\r\nNo. 139)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPENSĀTOR. [CALCULATOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDITHỸRAMBUS. [CHORUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĪVERSŌRĬUM. [CAUPONA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĪVĪNĀTĬO (μαντική), a power in man which foresees future things\r\nby means of those signs which the gods throw in his way. Among the\r\nGreeks the _manteis_ (μάντεις), or seers, who announced the future,\r\nwere supposed to be under the direct influence of the gods, chiefly\r\nthat of Apollo. In many families of seers the inspired knowledge of\r\nthe future was considered to be hereditary, and to be transmitted\r\nfrom father to son. To these families belonged the Iamids, who from\r\nOlympia spread over a considerable part of Greece; the Branchidae,\r\nnear Miletus; the Eumolpids, at Athens and Eleusis; the Telliads,\r\nthe Acarnanian seers, and others. Along with the seers we may also\r\nmention the Bacides and the Sibyllae. Both existed from a very remote\r\ntime, and were distinct from the manteis so far as they pretended\r\nto derive their knowledge of the future from sacred books (χρησμοί)\r\nwhich they consulted, and which were in some places, as at Athens\r\nand Rome, kept by the government or some especial officers, in the\r\nacropolis and in the most revered sanctuary. The Bacides are said to\r\nhave been descended from one or more prophetic nymphs of the name of\r\nBacis. The Sibyllae were prophetic women, probably of Asiatic origin,\r\nwhose peculiar custom seems to have been to wander with their sacred\r\nbooks from place to place. The Sibylla, whose books gained so great\r\nan importance at Rome, is reported to have been the Erythraean: the\r\nbooks which she was said to have sold to one of the Tarquins were\r\ncarefully concealed from the public, and only accessible to the\r\nduumvirs. Besides these more respectable prophets and prophetesses,\r\nthere were numbers of diviners of an inferior order (χρησμολόγοι),\r\nwho made it their business to explain all sorts of signs, and to\r\ntell fortunes. They were, however, more particularly popular with\r\nthe lower orders, who are everywhere most ready to believe what is\r\nmost marvellous and least entitled to credit. No public undertaking\r\nof any consequence was ever entered upon by the Greeks and Romans\r\nwithout consulting the will of the gods, by observing the signs\r\nwhich they sent, especially those in the sacrifices offered for the\r\npurpose, and by which they were thought to indicate the success\r\nor the failure of the undertaking. For this kind of divination no\r\ndivine inspiration was thought necessary, but merely experience and\r\na certain knowledge acquired by routine; and although in some cases\r\npriests were appointed for the purpose of observing and explaining\r\nsigns [AUGUR; HARUSPEX], yet on any sudden emergency, especially\r\nin private affairs, any one who met with something extraordinary,\r\nmight act as his own interpreter. The principal signs by which the\r\ngods were thought to declare their will, were things connected with\r\nthe offering of sacrifices, the flight and voice of birds, all\r\nkinds of natural phenomena, ordinary as well as extraordinary, and\r\ndreams.--The interpretation of signs of the first class (ἱερομαντεία\r\nor ἱεροσκοπία, _haruspicium_ or _ars haruspicina_) was, according\r\nto Aeschylus, the invention of Prometheus. It seems to have been\r\nmost cultivated by the Etruscans, among whom it was raised into a\r\ncomplete science, and from whom it passed to the Romans. Sacrifices\r\nwere either offered for the special purpose of consulting the gods,\r\nor in the ordinary way; but in both cases the signs were observed,\r\nand when they were propitious, the sacrifice was said καλλιερεῖν. The\r\nprincipal points that were generally observed were, 1. The manner\r\nin which the victim approached the altar. 2. The nature of the\r\nintestines with respect to their colour and smoothness; the liver\r\nand bile were of particular importance. 3. The nature of the flame\r\nwhich consumed the sacrifice. Especial care was also taken during\r\na sacrifice, that no inauspicious or frivolous words were uttered\r\nby any of the bystanders: hence the admonitions of the priests,\r\nεὐφημεῖτε and εὐφημία, or σιγᾶτε, σιωπᾶτε, _favete linguis_, and\r\nothers; for improper expressions were not only thought to pollute\r\nand profane the sacred act, but to be unlucky omens.--The art of\r\ninterpreting signs of the second class was called οἰωνιστική,\r\n_augurium_, or _auspicium_. It was, like the former, common to Greeks\r\nand Romans, but never attained the same degree of importance in\r\nGreece as it did in Rome. [AUSPICIUM.] The Greeks, when observing\r\nthe flight of birds, turned their face toward the north, and then a\r\nbird appearing to the right (east), especially an eagle, a heron, or\r\na falcon, was a favourable sign; while birds appearing to the left\r\n(west) were considered as unlucky signs. Of greater importance than\r\nthe appearance of animals, at least to the Greeks, were the phenomena\r\nin the heavens, particularly during any public transaction. Among the\r\nunlucky phenomena in the heavens (διοσημεῖα, _signa_, or _portenta_)\r\nwere thunder and lightning, an eclipse of the sun or moon,\r\nearthquakes, rain of blood, stones, milk, &c. Any one of these signs\r\nwas sufficient at Athens to break up the assembly of the people.--In\r\ncommon life, things apparently of no importance, when occurring at a\r\ncritical moment, were thought by the ancients to be signs sent by the\r\ngods, from which conclusions might be drawn respecting the future.\r\nAmong these common occurrences we may mention sneezing, twinkling\r\nof the eyes, tinkling of the ears, &c.--The art of interpreting\r\ndreams (ὀνειροπολία), which had probably been introduced into Europe\r\nfrom Asia, where it is still a universal practice, seems in the\r\nHomeric age to have been held in high esteem, for dreams were said\r\nto be sent by Zeus. In subsequent times, that class of diviners\r\nwho occupied themselves with the interpretation of dreams, seems\r\nto have been very numerous and popular; but they never enjoyed any\r\nprotection from the state, and were chiefly resorted to by private\r\nindividuals.--The subject of oracles is treated in a separate\r\narticle. [ORACULUM.]--The word _divinatio_ was used in a particular\r\nmanner by the Romans as a law term. If in any case two or more\r\naccusers came forward against one and the same individual, it was, as\r\nthe phrase ran, _decided by divination_, who should be the chief or\r\nreal accuser, whom the others then joined as _subscriptores;_ _i.e._ by\r\nputting their names to the charge brought against the offender. This\r\ntransaction, by which one of several accusers was selected to conduct\r\nthe accusation, was called _divinatio_, as the question here was not\r\nabout facts, but about something which was to be done, and which\r\ncould not be found out by witnesses or written documents; so that\r\nthe judices had, as it were, to divine the course which they had to\r\ntake. Hence the oration of Cicero, in which he tries to show that he,\r\nand not Q. Caecilius Niger, ought to conduct the accusation against\r\nVerres, is called _Divinatio in Caecilium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDĪVĪSOR. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDĪVORTĬUM (ἀπόλειψις, ἀπόπεμψις), divorce. (1) GREEK. The laws of\r\nAthens permitted either the husband or the wife to call for and\r\neffect a divorce. If it originated with the wife, she was said\r\nto leave her husband’s house (ἀπολείπειν); if otherwise, to be\r\ndismissed from it (ἀποπεμπέσθαι). After divorce, the wife resorted\r\nto her male relations, with whom she would have remained if she\r\nhad never quitted her maiden state; and it then became their duty\r\nto receive or recover from her late husband all the property that\r\nshe had brought to him in acknowledged dowry upon their marriage.\r\nIf, upon this, both parties were satisfied, the divorce was final\r\nand complete: if otherwise, an action ἀπολείψεως, or ἀποπέμψεως,\r\nwould be instituted, as the case might be, by the party opposed to\r\nthe separation. A separation, however, whether it originated from\r\nthe husband or the wife, was considered to reflect discredit on the\r\nlatter.--(2) ROMAN. Divorce always existed in the Roman polity.\r\nAs one essential part of a marriage was the consent and conjugal\r\naffection of the parties, it was considered that this affection was\r\nnecessary to its continuance, and accordingly either party might\r\ndeclare his or her intention to dissolve the connection. No judicial\r\ndecree, and no interference of any public authority, was requisite to\r\ndissolve a marriage. The first instance of divorce at Rome is said\r\nto have occurred about B.C. 234, when Sp. Carvilius Ruga put away\r\nhis wife, on the ground of barrenness: it is added, that his conduct\r\nwas generally condemned. Towards the latter part of the republic,\r\nand under the empire, divorces became very common. Pompey divorced\r\nhis wife Mucia for alleged adultery; and Cicero divorced his wife\r\nTerentia, after living with her thirty years, and married a young\r\nwoman. Cato the younger divorced his wife Marcia, that his friend\r\nHortensius might marry her, and have children by her; for this is\r\nthe true meaning of the story that he lent his wife to Hortensius.\r\nIf a husband divorced his wife, the wife’s dowry, as a general\r\nrule, was restored; and the same was the case when the divorce took\r\nplace by mutual consent. Corresponding to the forms of marriage by\r\n_confarreatio_ and _coemtio_, there were the forms of divorce by\r\n_diffarreatio_ and _remancipatio_. In course of time, less ceremony\r\nwas used; but still some distinct notice or declaration of intention\r\nwas necessary to constitute a divorce. The term _repudium_, it is\r\nsaid, properly applies to a marriage only contracted, and _divortium_\r\nto an actual marriage; but sometimes divortium and repudium appear\r\nto be used indifferently. The phrases to express a divorce are,\r\n_nuntium remittere_, _divortium facere_; and the form of words\r\nmight be as follows--_Tuas res tibi habeto, tuas res tibi agito_.\r\nThe phrases used to express the renunciation of a marriage contract\r\nwere, _renuntiare repudium_, _repudium remittere_, _dicere_, and\r\n_repudiare_; and the form of words might be, _Conditione tua non\r\nutor_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDŎCĂNA (τὰ δόκανα, from δοκός, a beam) was an ancient symbolical\r\nrepresentation of the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux), at Sparta.\r\nIt consisted of two upright beams with others laid across them\r\ntransversely.\r\n\r\n\r\nDŎCĬMĂSĬA (δοκιμασία). When any citizen of Athens was either\r\nappointed by lot, or chosen by suffrage, to hold a public office,\r\nhe was obliged, before entering on its duties, to submit to a\r\n_docimasia_, or scrutiny into his previous life and conduct, in which\r\nany person could object to him as unfit. The _docimasia_, however,\r\nwas not confined to persons appointed to public offices; for we read\r\nof the denouncement of a scrutiny against orators who spoke in the\r\nassembly while leading profligate lives, or after having committed\r\nflagitious crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDODRANS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDŎLĀBRA, _dim._ DŎLĀBELLA (σμίλη, _dim_. σμιλίον), a chisel, a celt,\r\nwas used for a variety of purposes in ancient as in modern times.\r\n_Celtes_ is an old Latin word for a chisel, probably derived from\r\n_coelo_, to engrave. Celts, or chisels, were frequently employed in\r\nmaking entrenchments and in destroying fortifications; and hence they\r\nare often found in ancient earth-works and encampments. They are for\r\nthe most part of bronze, more rarely of hard stone. The sizes and\r\nforms which they present, are as various as the uses to which they\r\nwere applied. The annexed woodcut is designed to show a few of the\r\nmost remarkable varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dolabrae, Celts.

It was inserted in the handles of whips, and\r\nalso in walking sticks, thus corresponding to our sword-stick.--(2) A\r\nsmall top-sail.\r\n\r\n\r\nDŎMĬNĬUM signifies quiritarian ownership, or property in a thing; and\r\n_dominus_, or _dominus legitimus_, is the owner. The dominus has the\r\npower of dealing with a thing as he pleases, and differs from the\r\nbare _possessor_, who has only the right of possession, and has not\r\nthe absolute ownership of the thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDŎMUS (οἶκος), a house.--(1) GREEK. A Greek house was always divided\r\ninto two distinct portions, the _Andronitis_, or men’s apartments\r\n(ἀνδρωνῖτις), and the _Gynaeconitis_, or women’s apartments\r\n(γυναικωνῖτις). In the earliest times, as in the houses referred\r\nto by Homer, and in some houses at a later period, the women’s\r\napartments were in the upper story (ὑπερῷον), but usually at a later\r\ntime the gynaeconitis was on the same story with the andronitis,\r\nand behind it. The front of the house towards the street was not\r\nlarge, as the apartments extended rather in the direction of its\r\ndepth than of its width. In towns the houses were often built side\r\nby side, with party-walls between. The exterior wall was plain,\r\nbeing composed generally of stone, brick, and timber, and often\r\ncovered with stucco. There was no open space between the street and\r\nthe house-door, like the Roman _vestibulum_. The πρόθυρα, which is\r\nsometimes mentioned, seems to be merely the space in front of the\r\nhouse, where there was generally an altar of Apollo Agyieus, or a\r\nrude obelisk emblematical of the god. Sometimes there was a laurel\r\ntree in the same position, and sometimes a head of the god Hermes.\r\nA few steps (ἀναβαθμοί) led up to the house-door, which generally\r\nbore some inscription, for the sake of a good omen, or as a charm.\r\nThe door sometimes opened outwards; but this seems to have been\r\nan exception to the general rule, as is proved by the expressions\r\nused for opening, ἐνδοῦναι, and shutting it, ἐπισπάσασθαι and\r\nἐφελκύσασθαι. The handles were called ἐπισπαστῆρες. The house-door\r\nwas called αὔλειος or αὔλεια θύρα, because it led to the αὐλή. It\r\ngave admittance to a narrow passage (θυρωρεῖον, πυλών, θυρών), on\r\none side of which, in a large house, were the stables, on the other\r\nthe porter’s lodge. The duty of the porter (θυρωρός) was to admit\r\nvisitors and to prevent anything improper from being carried into or\r\nout of the house. The porter was attended by a dog. Hence the phrase\r\nεὐλαβεῖσθαι τὴν κύνα, corresponding to the Latin _Cave canem_. From\r\nthe θυρωρεῖον we pass into the peristyle or court (περιστύλιον, αὐλή)\r\nof the andronitis, which was a space open to the sky in the centre\r\n(ὕπαιθρον), and surrounded on all four sides by porticoes (στοαί), of\r\nwhich one, probably that nearest the entrance, was called προστόον.\r\nThese porticoes were used for exercise, and sometimes for dining in.\r\nHere was commonly the altar on which sacrifices were offered to the\r\nhousehold gods. In building the porticoes the object sought was to\r\nobtain as much sun in winter, and as much shade and air in summer as\r\npossible. Round the peristyle were arranged the chambers used by the\r\nmen, such as banqueting rooms (οἶκοι, ἀνδρῶνες), which were large\r\nenough to contain several sets of couches (τρίκλινοι, ἑπτάκλινοι,\r\nτριακοντάκλινοι, and at the same time to allow abundant room for\r\nattendants, musicians, and performers of games; parlours or sitting\r\nrooms (ἐξέδραι), and smaller chambers and sleeping rooms (δωμάτια,\r\nκοιτῶνες, οἰκήματα); picture-galleries and libraries, and sometimes\r\nstore-rooms; and in the arrangement of these apartments attention was\r\npaid to their aspect. The peristyle of the andronitis was connected\r\nwith that of the gynaeconitis by a door called μέταυλος, μέσαυλος, or\r\nμεσαύλιος, which was in the middle of the portico of the peristyle\r\nopposite to the entrance. By means of this door all communication\r\nbetween the andronitis and gynaeconitis could be shut off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground-plan of a Greek House.\r\n\r\nα, House-door, αὔλειος θύρα: θυρ’, passage, θυρωρεῖον or θυρών: Α,\r\nperistyle, or αὐλή of the andronitis; ο, the halls and chambers\r\nof the andronitis; μ, μέταυλος or μέσαυλος θύρα: Γ, peristyle of\r\nthe gynaeconitis; γ, chambers of the gynaeconitis; π, προστάς or\r\nπαραστάς: θ, θάλαμος and ἀμφιθάλαμος: Ι, rooms for working in wool\r\n(ἱστῶνες); Κ, garden-door, κηταία θύρα.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly Xenophon calls it θύρα βαλανωτός. Its name μέσαυλος is\r\nevidently derived from μέσος, and means the door _between_ the two\r\nαὐλαί or peristyles. This door gave admittance to the peristyle\r\nof the gynaeconitis, which differed from that of the andronitis\r\nin having porticoes round only three of its sides. On the fourth\r\nside were placed two antae [ANTAE], at a considerable distance\r\nfrom each other. A third of the distance between these antae was\r\nset off inwards, thus forming a chamber or vestibule, which was\r\ncalled προστάς, παραστάς, and πρόδρομος. On the right and left of\r\nthis προστάς were two bed-chambers, the θάλαμος and ἀμφιθάλαμος,\r\nof which the former was the principal bed-chamber of the house,\r\nand here also seem to have been kept the vases, and other valuable\r\narticles of ornament. Beyond these rooms were large apartments\r\n(ἱστῶνες) used for working in wool. Round the peristyle were the\r\neating-rooms, bed-chambers, store-rooms, and other apartments in\r\ncommon use. Besides the αὔλειος θύρα and the μέσαυλος θύρα, there\r\nwas a third door (κηπαία θύρα) leading to the garden. The preceding\r\nis a conjectural plan of the ground-floor of a Greek house of the\r\nlarger size. There was usually, though not always, an upper story\r\n(ὑπερῷον διῆρες), which seldom extended over the whole space occupied\r\nby the lower story. The principal use of the upper story was for the\r\nlodging of the slaves. The access to the upper floor seems to have\r\nbeen sometimes by stairs on the outside of the house, leading up from\r\nthe street. Guests were also lodged in the upper story. But in some\r\nlarge houses there were rooms set apart for their reception (ξενῶνες)\r\non the ground-floor. The roofs were generally flat, and it was\r\ncustomary to walk about upon them. In the interior of the house the\r\nplace of doors was sometimes supplied by curtains (παραπετάσματα),\r\nwhich were either plain, or dyed, or embroidered. The principal\r\nopenings for the admission of light and air were in the roofs of\r\nthe peristyles; but it is incorrect to suppose that the houses had\r\nno windows (θυρίδες), or at least none overlooking the street. They\r\nwere not at all uncommon. Artificial warmth was procured partly by\r\nmeans of fire-places. It is supposed that chimneys were altogether\r\nunknown, and that the smoke escaped through an opening in the roof\r\n(καπνοδόκη), but it is not easy to understand how this could be the\r\ncase when there was an upper story. Little portable stoves (ἐσχάραι,\r\nἐσχαρίδες) or chafing-dishes (ἀνθράκια) were frequently used. The\r\nhouses of the wealthy in the country, at least in Attica, were much\r\nlarger and more magnificent than those in the towns. The latter seem\r\nto have been generally small and plain, especially in earlier times,\r\nwhen the Greeks preferred expending the resources of art and wealth\r\non their temples and public buildings; but the private houses became\r\nmore magnificent as the public buildings began to be neglected. The\r\ndecorations of the interior were very plain at the period to which\r\nour description refers. The floors were of stone. At a late period\r\ncoloured stones were used. Mosaics are first mentioned under the\r\nkings of Pergamus. The walls, up to the 4th century B.C., seem to\r\nhave been only whited. The first instance of painting them is that\r\nof Alcibiades. This innovation met with considerable opposition.\r\nWe have also mention of painted ceilings at the same period. At a\r\nlater period this mode of decoration became general.--(2) ROMAN. The\r\nhouses of the Romans were poor and mean for many centuries after the\r\nfoundation of the city. Till the war with Pyrrhus the houses were\r\ncovered only with thatch or shingles, and were usually built of wood\r\nor unbaked bricks. It was not till the latter times of the republic,\r\nwhen wealth had been acquired by conquests in the East, that houses\r\nof any splendour began to be built; but it then became the fashion\r\nnot only to build houses of an immense size, but also to adorn them\r\nwith columns, paintings, statues, and costly works of art. Some idea\r\nmay be formed of the size and magnificence of the houses of the Roman\r\nnobles during the later times of the republic by the price which\r\nthey fetched. The consul Messalla bought the house of Autronius for\r\n3700 sestertia (nearly 33,000_l._), and Cicero the house of Crassus,\r\non the Palatine, for 3500 sestertia (nearly 31,000_l._). The house\r\nof Publius Clodius, whom Milo killed, cost 14,800 sestertia (about\r\n131,000_l._); and the Tusculan villa of Scaurus was fitted up with\r\nsuch magnificence, that when it was burnt by his slaves, he lost\r\n100,000 sestertia, upwards of 885,000_l._--Houses were originally\r\nonly one story high; but as the value of ground increased in the\r\ncity they were built several stories in height, and the highest\r\nfloors were usually inhabited by the poor. Till the time of Nero,\r\nthe streets in Rome were narrow and irregular, and bore traces of\r\nthe haste and confusion with which the city was built after it had\r\nbeen burnt by the Gauls; but after the great fire in the time of\r\nthat emperor, by which two-thirds of Rome was burnt to the ground,\r\nthe city was built with great regularity. The streets were made\r\nstraight and broad; the height of the houses was restricted, and a\r\ncertain part of each was required to be built of Gabian or Alban\r\nstone, which was proof against fire. The principal parts of a Roman\r\nhouse were the, 1. _Vestibulum_, 2. _Ostium_, 3. _Atrium_ or _Cavum\r\nAedium_, 4. _Alae_, 5. _Tablinum_, 6. _Fauces_, 7. _Peristylium_.\r\nThe parts of a house which were considered of less importance,\r\nand of which the arrangement differed in different houses, were\r\nthe, 1. _Cubicula_, 2. _Triclinia_, 3. _Oeci_, 4. _Exedrae_, 5.\r\n_Pinacotheca_, 6. _Bibliotheca_, 7. _Balineum_, 8. _Culina_, 9.\r\n_Coenacula_, 10. _Diaeta_, 11. _Solaria_. We shall speak of each\r\nin order.--1. VESTIBULUM did not properly form part of the house,\r\nbut was a vacant space before the door, forming a court, which was\r\nsurrounded on three sides by the house, and was open on the fourth\r\nto the street.--2. OSTIUM, which is also called _janua_ and _fores_,\r\nwas the entrance to the house. The street-door admitted into a hall,\r\nto which the name of ostium was also given, and in which there was\r\nfrequently a small room (_cella_) for the porter (_janitor_ or\r\n_ostiarius_), and also for a dog, which was usually kept in the hall\r\nto guard the house. Another door (_janua interior_) opposite the\r\nstreet-door led into the atrium.--3. ATRIUM or CAVUM AEDIUM, also\r\nwritten _Cavaedium_, are probably only different names of the same\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Atrium of the House of Ceres at Pompeii.]\r\n\r\nThe Atrium or Cavum Aedium was a large apartment roofed over with\r\nthe exception of an opening in the centre, called _compluvium_,\r\ntowards which the roof sloped so as to throw the rain-water into\r\na cistern in the floor, termed _impluvium_, which was frequently\r\nornamented with statues, columns, and other works of art. The word\r\n_impluvium_, however, is also employed to denote the aperture in\r\nthe roof. The atrium was the most important room in the house,\r\nand among the wealthy was usually fitted up with much splendour\r\nand magnificence. Originally it was the only sitting-room in the\r\nhouse; but in the houses of the wealthy it was distinct from the\r\nprivate apartments, and was used as a reception-room, where the\r\npatron received his clients, and the great and noble the numerous\r\nvisitors who were accustomed to call every morning to pay their\r\nrespects or solicit favours. But though the atrium was not used by\r\nthe wealthy as a sitting-room for the family, it still continued to\r\nbe employed for many purposes which it had originally served. Thus\r\nthe nuptial couch was placed in the atrium opposite the door, and\r\nalso the instruments and materials for spinning and weaving, which\r\nwere formerly carried on by the women of the family in this room.\r\nHere also the images of their ancestors were placed, and the focus or\r\nfire-place, which possessed a sacred character, being dedicated to\r\nthe Lares of each family.--4. ALAE, wings, were small apartments or\r\nrecesses on the left and right sides of the atrium.--5. TABLINUM was\r\nin all probability a recess or room at the further end of the atrium\r\nopposite the door leading into the hall, and was regarded as part of\r\nthe atrium. It contained the family records and archives. With the\r\ntablinum the Roman house appears to have originally ceased; and the\r\nsleeping-rooms were probably arranged on each side of the atrium. But\r\nwhen the atrium and its surrounding rooms were used for the reception\r\nof clients and other public visitors, it became necessary to increase\r\nthe size of the house; and the following rooms were accordingly\r\nadded:--6. FAUCES appear to have been passages, which passed from the\r\natrium to the peristylium or interior of the house.--7. PERISTYLIUM\r\nwas in its general form like the atrium, but it was one-third greater\r\nin breadth, measured transversely, than in length. It was a court\r\nopen to the sky in the middle; the open part, which was surrounded\r\nby columns, was larger than the impluvium in the atrium, and was\r\nfrequently decorated with flowers and shrubs.--The arrangement of the\r\nrooms, which are next to be noticed, varied according to the taste\r\nand circumstances of the owner. It is therefore impossible to assign\r\nto them any regular place in the house.--1. CUBICULA, bed-chambers,\r\nappear to have been usually small. There were separate cubicula for\r\nthe day and night; the latter were also called _dormitoria_.--2.\r\nTRICLINIA are treated of in a separate article. [TRICLINIUM.]--3.\r\nOECI, from the Greek οἶκος, were spacious halls or saloons borrowed\r\nfrom the Greeks, and were frequently used as triclinia. They were to\r\nhave the same proportions as triclinia, but were to be more spacious\r\non account of having columns, which triclinia had not.--4. EXEDRAE\r\nwere rooms for conversation and the other purposes of society.--5.\r\nPINACOTHECA, a picture-gallery.--6, 7. BIBLIOTHECA and BALINEUM are\r\ntreated of in separate articles.--8. CULINA, the kitchen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kitchen of the House of Pansa at Pompeii.]\r\n\r\nThe food was originally cooked in the atrium: but the progress of\r\nrefinement afterwards led to the use of another part of the house for\r\nthis purpose. In the kitchen of Pansa’s house at Pompeii, a stove for\r\nstews and similar preparations was found, very much like the charcoal\r\nstoves used in the present day. Before it lie a knife, a strainer,\r\nand a kind of frying-pan with four spherical cavities, as if it were\r\nmeant to cook eggs.--9. COENACULA, properly signified rooms to dine\r\nin; but after it became the fashion to dine in the upper part of the\r\nhouse, the whole of the rooms above the ground-floor were called\r\n_coenacula_.--10. DIAETA, an apartment used for dining in, and for\r\nthe other purposes of life. It appears to have been smaller than\r\nthe triclinium. _Diaeta_ is also the name given by Pliny to rooms\r\ncontaining three or four bed-chambers (_cubicula_). Pleasure-houses\r\nor summer-houses are also called _diaetae_.--11. SOLARIA, properly\r\nplaces for basking in the sun, were terraces on the tops of houses.\r\nThe preceding cut represents the atrium of a house at Pompeii. In\r\nthe centre is the impluvium, and the passage at the further end is\r\nthe ostium or entrance hall.--The preceding account of the different\r\nrooms, and especially of the arrangement of the atrium, tablinum,\r\nperistyle, &c., is best illustrated by the houses which have been\r\ndisinterred at Pompeii. The ground-plan of one is accordingly\r\nsubjoined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground-plan of a House at Pompeii.]\r\n\r\nLike most of the other houses at Pompeii, it had no vestibulum\r\naccording to the meaning given above. 1. The _ostium_ or\r\nentrance-hall, which is six feet wide and nearly thirty long. Near\r\nthe street-door there is a figure of a large fierce dog worked in\r\nmosaic on the pavement, and beneath it is written _Cave Canem_. The\r\ntwo large rooms on each side of the vestibule appear from the large\r\nopenings in front of them to have been shops; they communicate with\r\nthe entrance-hall, and were therefore probably occupied by the master\r\nof the house. 2. The _atrium_, which is about twenty-eight feet in\r\nlength and twenty in breadth; its _impluvium_ is near the centre\r\nof the room, and its floor is paved with white tesserae, spotted\r\nwith black. 3. Chambers for the use of the family, or intended for\r\nthe reception of guests, who were entitled to claim hospitality.\r\n4. A small room with a staircase leading up to the upper rooms.\r\n5. _Alae._ 6. The _tablinum_. 7. The _fauces_. 8. Peristyle, with\r\nDoric columns and garden in the centre. The large room on the right\r\nof the peristyle is the triclinium; beside it is the kitchen; and\r\nthe smaller apartments are cubicula and other rooms for the use of\r\nthe family.--Having given a general description of the rooms of a\r\nRoman house, it remains to speak of the (1) floors, (2) walls, (3)\r\nceilings, (4) windows, and (5) the mode of warming the rooms. For\r\nthe doors, see JANUA.--(1.) The floor (_solum_) of a room was seldom\r\nboarded: it was generally covered with stone or marble, or mosaics.\r\nThe common floors were paved with pieces of bricks, tiles, stones,\r\n&c., forming a kind of composition called _ruderatic_. Sometimes\r\npieces of marble were imbedded in a composition ground, and these\r\nprobably gave the idea of mosaics. As these floors were beaten\r\ndown (_pavita_) with rammers (_fistucae_), the word _pavimentum_\r\nbecame the general name for a floor. Mosaics, called by Pliny\r\n_lithostrota_ (λιθόστρωτα), though this word has a more extensive\r\nmeaning, first came into use in Sulla’s time, who made one in the\r\ntemple of Fortune at Praeneste. Mosaic work was afterwards called\r\n_Musivum opus_, and was most extensively employed.--(2.) The inner\r\nwalls (_parietes_) of private rooms were frequently lined with slabs\r\nof marble, but were more usually covered by paintings, which in the\r\ntime of Augustus were made upon the walls themselves. This practice\r\nwas so common that we find even the small houses in Pompeii have\r\npaintings upon their walls.--(3.) The ceilings seem originally to\r\nhave been left uncovered, the beams which supported the roof or the\r\nupper story being visible. Afterwards planks were placed across\r\nthese beams at certain intervals, leaving hollow spaces, called\r\n_lacunaria_ or _laquearia_, which were frequently covered with\r\ngold and ivory, and sometimes with paintings. There was an arched\r\nceiling in common use, called CAMARA.--(4.) The Roman houses had\r\nfew windows (_fenestrae_). The principal apartments, the atrium,\r\nperistyle, &c., were lighted from above, and the cubicula and other\r\nsmall rooms generally derived their light from them, and not from\r\nwindows looking into the street. The rooms only on the upper story\r\nseem to have been usually lighted by windows. The windows appear\r\noriginally to have been merely openings in the wall, closed by means\r\nof shutters, which frequently had two leaves (_bifores fenestrae_).\r\nWindows were also sometimes covered by a kind of lattice or trellis\r\nwork (_clathri_), and sometimes by net-work, to prevent serpents\r\nand other noxious reptiles from getting in. Afterwards, however,\r\nwindows were made of a transparent stone, called _lapis specularis_\r\n(mica); such windows were called _specularia_. Windows made of glass\r\n(_vitrum_) are first mentioned by Lactantius, who lived in the fourth\r\ncentury of the Christian era; but the discoveries at Pompeii prove\r\nthat glass was used for windows under the early emperors.--(5.) The\r\nrooms were heated in winter in different ways; but the Romans had\r\nno stoves like ours. The cubicula, triclinia, and other rooms,\r\nwhich were intended for winter use, were built in that part of the\r\nhouse upon which the sun shone most; and in the mild climate of\r\nItaly this frequently enabled them to dispense with any artificial\r\nmode of warming the rooms. Rooms exposed to the sun in this way were\r\nsometimes called _heliocamini_. The rooms were sometimes heated by\r\nhot air, which was introduced by means of pipes from a furnace below,\r\nbut more frequently by portable furnaces or braziers (_foculi_), in\r\nwhich coal or charcoal was burnt. The _caminus_ was also a kind of\r\nstove, in which wood appears to have been usually burnt, and probably\r\nonly differed from the _foculus_ in being larger and fixed to one\r\nplace. The rooms usually had no chimneys for carrying off the smoke,\r\nwhich escaped through the windows, doors, and openings in the roof;\r\nstill chimneys do not appear to have been entirely unknown to the\r\nancients, as some are said to have been found in the ruins of ancient\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nDŌNĀRĬA (ἀναθήματα or ἀνακείμενα), presents made to the gods, either\r\nby individuals or communities. Sometimes they are also called\r\n_dona_ or δῶρα. The belief that the gods were pleased with costly\r\npresents was as natural to the ancients as the belief that they\r\ncould be influenced in their conduct towards men by the offering of\r\nsacrifices; and, indeed, both sprang from the same feeling. Presents\r\nwere mostly given as tokens of gratitude for some favour which a god\r\nhad bestowed on man; as, for instance, by persons who had recovered\r\nfrom illness or escaped from shipwreck; but some are also mentioned,\r\nwhich were intended to induce the deity to grant some especial\r\nfavour. Almost all presents were dedicated in temples, to which in\r\nsome places an especial building was added, in which these treasures\r\nwere preserved. Such buildings were called θησαυροί(treasuries);\r\nand in the most frequented temples of Greece many states had their\r\nseparate treasuries. The act of dedication was called ἀνατιθέναι,\r\n_donare_, _dedicare_, or _sacrare_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDŌNĀTĪVUM. [CONGIARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDORMĪTŌRĬA. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOS (φερνή, προΐξ), dowry. (1) GREEK. In the Homeric times it was\r\ncustomary for the husband to purchase his wife from her relations,\r\nby gifts called ἕδνα or ἔεδνα. But at Athens, during the historical\r\nperiod, the contrary was the case; for every woman had to bring her\r\nhusband some dowry, and so universal was the practice, that one of\r\nthe chief distinctions between a wife and a παλλακή, or concubine,\r\nconsisted in the former having a portion, whereas the latter had\r\nnot; hence, persons who married wives without portions appear to\r\nhave given them or their guardians an acknowledgment in writing by\r\nwhich the receipt of a portion was admitted. Moreover, poor heiresses\r\nwere either married or portioned by their next of kin, according to\r\na law, which fixed the amount of portion to be given at five minae\r\nby a Pentacosiomedimnus, three by a Horseman, and one and a half by\r\na Zeugites. The husband had to give to the relatives or guardians\r\nof the wife security (ἀποτίμημα) for the dowry, which was not\r\nconsidered the property of the husband himself, but rather of his\r\nwife and children. The portion was returned to the wife in case of a\r\ndivorce.--(2) ROMAN. The _dos_ among the Romans was every thing which\r\non the occasion of a woman’s marriage was transferred by her, or by\r\nanother person, to the husband. All the property of the wife which\r\nwas not made dos continued to be her own, and was comprised under the\r\nname of _parapherna_. The dos upon its delivery became the husband’s\r\nproperty, and continued to be his so long as the marriage relation\r\nexisted. In the case of divorce, the woman, or her relations, could\r\nbring an action for the restitution of the dos; and, accordingly, a\r\nwoman whose dos was large (_dotata uxor_) had some influence over her\r\nhusband, inasmuch as she had the power of divorcing herself, and thus\r\nof depriving him of the enjoyment of her property.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Attic Drachma. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nDRACHMA (δραχμή), the principal silver coin among the Greeks. The two\r\nchief standards in the currencies of the Greek states were the Attic\r\nand Aeginetan. The average value of the Attic drachma was 9¾_d._ of\r\nour money. It contained six obols (ὀβολοί); and the Athenians had\r\nseparate silver coins, from four drachmae to a quarter of an obol.\r\nThere were also silver pieces of two drachmae and four drachmae.\r\n(See tables.) The tetradrachm in later times was called _stater_.\r\nThe latter word also signifies a gold coin, equal in value to twenty\r\ndrachmae [STATER]. The obolos, in later times, was of bronze: but in\r\nthe best times of Athens we only read of silver obols. The χαλκοῦς\r\nwas a copper coin, and the eighth part of an obol. The Attic\r\nstandard prevailed most in the maritime and commercial states. It\r\nwas the standard of Philip’s gold, and was introduced by Alexander\r\nfor silver also.--The Aeginetan standard appears to have been the\r\nprevalent one in early times: we are told that money was first coined\r\nat Aegina by order of Pheidon at Argos. In later times the Aeginetan\r\nstandard was used in almost all the states of the Peloponnesus,\r\nexcept Corinth. The average value of the Aeginetan drachma was 1_s._\r\n1¾_d._ in our money; and the values of the different coins of this\r\nstandard are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                |  Shill.  |   Pence.  |  Farth.\r\n  ½ Obol        |   -      |     1     |   0·583\r\n  Obol          |   -      |     2     |   1·166\r\n  Diobolus      |   -      |     4     |   2·33\r\n  Triobolus     |   -      |     6     |   2·5\r\n  Drachma       |   1      |     1     |   3\r\n  Didrachm      |   2      |     3     |   2\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aeginetan Drachma. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nAs the Romans reckoned in sesterces, so the Greeks generally reckoned\r\nby drachmae; and when a sum is mentioned in the Attic writers,\r\nwithout any specification of the unit, drachmae are usually meant.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRĂCO. [SIGNA MILITARIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDŬCĒNĀRĬI.--(1) The name given to the Roman procuratores, who\r\nreceived a salary of 200 sestertia. The procuratores first received a\r\nsalary in the time of Augustus.--(2) A class or decuria of judices,\r\nfirst established by Augustus. They were so called because their\r\nproperty, as valued in the census, amounted only to 200 sestertia.\r\nThey appear to have tried cases of small importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDŬCENTĒSĬMA.

[LEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDUPLĀRĬI or DUPLĬCĀRĬI, were soldiers who received on account of\r\ntheir good conduct double allowance (_duplicia cibaria_), and perhaps\r\nin some cases double pay likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\nDŬPONDĬUS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDUSSIS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDUUMVĬRI, or the two men, the name of various magistrates and\r\nfunctionaries at Rome, and in the coloniae and municipia. (1)\r\nDUUMVIRI JURI DICUNDO were the highest magistrates in the municipal\r\ntowns. [COLONIA.]--(2) DUUMVIRI NAVALES, extraordinary magistrates,\r\nwho were created, whenever occasion required, for the purpose\r\nof equipping and repairing the fleet. They appear to have been\r\noriginally appointed by the consuls and dictators, but were first\r\nelected by the people, B.C. 311.--(3) DUUMVIRI PERDUELLIONIS.\r\n[PERDUELLIO.]--(4) DUUMVIRI QUINQUENNALES, were the censors in the\r\nmunicipal towns, and must not be confounded with the _duumviri juri\r\ndicundo_. [COLONIA.]--(5) DUUMVIRI SACRORUM originally had the charge\r\nof the Sibylline books. Their duties were afterwards discharged by\r\nthe _decemviri sacris faciundis_. [DECEMVIRI.]--(6) DUUMVIRI were\r\nalso appointed for the purpose of building or dedicating a temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECCLĒSĬA (ἐκκλησία), the name of the general assembly of the citizens\r\nat Athens, in which they met to discuss and determine upon matters\r\nof public interest, and which was therefore the sovereign power\r\nin the state. These assemblies were either _ordinary_ (νόμιμοι or\r\nκυρίαι), and held four times in each prytany, or _extraordinary_,\r\nthat is, specially convened, upon any sudden emergency, and therefore\r\ncalled σύγκλητοι. The place in which they were anciently held was\r\nthe _agora_. Afterwards they were transferred to the Pnyx, and at\r\nlast to the great theatre of Dionysus, and other places. The most\r\nusual place, however, was the Pnyx, which was situated to the west\r\nof the Areiopagus, on a slope connected with Mount Lycabettus, and\r\npartly at least within the walls of the city. It was semicircular in\r\nform, with a boundary wall part rock and part masonry, and an area of\r\nabout 12,000 square yards. On the north the ground was filled up and\r\npaved with large stones, so as to get a level surface on the slope.\r\nTowards this side, and close to the wall, was the _bema_ (βῆμα), a\r\nstone platform or hustings ten or eleven feet high, with an ascent\r\nof steps. The position of the _bema_ was such as to command a view\r\nof the sea from behind, and of the Propylaea and Parthenon in front,\r\nand we may be sure that the Athenian orators would often rouse the\r\nnational feelings of their hearers by pointing to the assemblage of\r\nmagnificent edifices, “monuments of Athenian gratitude and glory,”\r\nwhich they had in view from the Pnyx.--The right of convening\r\nthe people was generally vested in the prytanes or presidents of\r\nthe council of Five Hundred [see BOULÉ], but in cases of sudden\r\nemergency, and especially during wars, the strategi also had the\r\npower of calling extraordinary meetings, for which, however, the\r\nconsent of the senate appears to have been necessary. The prytanes\r\nnot only gave a previous notice of the day of assembly, and published\r\na programme of the subjects to be discussed, but also, it appears,\r\nsent a crier round to collect the citizens. All persons who did not\r\nobey the call were subject to a fine, and six magistrates called\r\nlexiarchs were appointed, whose duty it was to take care that the\r\npeople attended the meetings, and to levy fines on those who refused\r\nto do so. With a view to this, whenever an assembly was to be held,\r\ncertain public slaves (Σκύθαι or τοξόται) were sent round to sweep\r\nthe agora, and other places of public resort, with a rope coloured\r\nwith vermilion. The different persons whom these ropemen met, were\r\ndriven by them towards the ecclesia, and those who refused to go were\r\nmarked by the rope and fined. An additional inducement to attend,\r\nwith the poorer classes, was the μισθὸς ἐκκλησιαστικός, or pay which\r\nthey received for it. The payment was originally an obolus, but was\r\nafterwards raised to three. The right of attending was enjoyed by all\r\nlegitimate citizens who were of the proper age (generally supposed\r\nto be twenty, certainly not less than eighteen), and not labouring\r\nunder any _atimia_, or loss of civil rights.--In the article BOULÉ it\r\nis explained who the prytanes and the proedri were; and we may here\r\nremark, that it was the duty of the proedri of the same tribe, under\r\nthe presidency of their chairman (ὁ ἐπιστάτης), to lay before the\r\npeople the subjects to be discussed; to read, or cause to be read,\r\nthe previous bill (τὸ προβούλευμα) of the senate, without which no\r\nmeasure could be brought before the ecclesia, and to give permission\r\nto the speakers to address the people. The officers who acted under\r\nthem, were the crier (ὁ κήρυξ), and the Scythian bowmen.--Previous,\r\nhowever, to the commencement of any business, the place was purified\r\nby the offering of sacrifices, and then the gods were implored in\r\na prayer to bless the proceedings of the meeting. The privilege of\r\naddressing the assembly was not confined to any class or age among\r\nthose who had the right to be present: all, without any distinction,\r\nwere invited to do so by the proclamation, Τίς ἀγορεύειν βούλεται,\r\nwhich was made by the crier after the proedri had gone through the\r\nnecessary preliminaries, and laid the subject of discussion before\r\nthe meeting; for though, according to the institutions of Solon,\r\nthose persons who were above fifty years of age ought to have been\r\ncalled upon to speak first, this regulation had in later times\r\nbecome quite obsolete. The speakers are sometimes simply called οἱ\r\nπαρίοντες, and appear to have worn a crown of myrtle on their heads\r\nwhile addressing the assembly. The most influential and practised\r\nspeakers of the assembly were generally distinguished by the name of\r\nῥήτορες. After the speakers had concluded, any one was at liberty\r\nto propose a decree, whether drawn up beforehand or framed in the\r\nmeeting, which, however, it was necessary to present to the proedri,\r\nthat they might see, in conjunction with the _nomophylaces_, whether\r\nthere was contained in it anything injurious to the state, or\r\ncontrary to the existing laws. If not, it was read by the crier;\r\nthough, even after the reading, the chairman could prevent it being\r\nput to the vote, unless his opposition was overborne by threats and\r\nclamours. Private individuals also could do the same, by engaging\r\nupon oath (ὑπωμοσία) to bring against the author of any measure\r\nthey might object to, an accusation called a γραφὴ παράνομων. If,\r\nhowever, the chairman refused to submit any question to the decision\r\nof the people, he might be proceeded against by _endeixis_; and if\r\nhe allowed the people to vote upon a proposal which was contrary\r\nto existing constitutional laws, he was in some cases liable to\r\n_atimia_. If, on the contrary, no opposition of this sort was offered\r\nto a proposed decree, the votes of the people were taken, by the\r\npermission of the chairman and with the consent of the rest of the\r\nproedri. The decision of the people was given either by show of\r\nhands, or by ballot, _i.e._ by casting pebbles into urns (καδίσκοι);\r\nthe former was expressed by the word χειροτονεῖν, the latter by\r\nψηφίζεσθαι, although the two terms are frequently confounded. The\r\nmore usual method of voting was by show of hands, as being more\r\nexpeditious and convenient (χειροτονία). Vote by ballot, on the other\r\nhand, was only used in a few special cases determined by law; as,\r\nfor instance, when a proposition was made for allowing those who\r\nhad suffered _atimia_ to appeal to the people for restitution of\r\ntheir former rights; or for inflicting extraordinary punishments on\r\natrocious offenders, and generally, upon any matter which affected\r\nprivate persons. In cases of this sort it was settled by law, that\r\na decree should not be valid unless six thousand citizens at least\r\nvoted in favour of it. This was by far the majority of those citizens\r\nwho were in the habit of attending; for, in time of war, the number\r\nnever amounted to five thousand, and in time of peace seldom to ten\r\nthousand.--The determination or decree of the people was called a\r\nψήφισμα, which properly signifies a law proposed to an assembly,\r\nand approved of by the people. Respecting the form for drawing up a\r\nψήφισμα, see BOULÉ.--When the business was over, the order for the\r\ndismissal of the assembly was given by the prytanes, through the\r\nproclamation of the crier; and as it was not customary to continue\r\nmeetings, which usually began early in the morning, till after\r\nsunset, if one day were not sufficient for the completion of any\r\nbusiness, it was adjourned to the next. But an assembly was sometimes\r\nbroken up, if any one, whether a magistrate or private individual,\r\ndeclared that he saw an unfavourable omen, or perceived thunder and\r\nlightning. The sudden appearance of rain also, or the shock of an\r\nearthquake, or any natural phenomenon of the kind called διοσημίαι,\r\nwas a sufficient reason for the hasty adjournment of an assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nECCLETI. [HOMOEI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nECDĬCUS (ἔκδικος), the name of an officer in many of the towns of\r\nAsia Minor during the Roman dominion, whose principal duty was the\r\ncare of the public money, and the prosecution of all parties who owed\r\nmoney to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nECMARTȲRĬA (ἐκμαρτυρία), signifies the deposition of a witness at\r\nAthens, who, by reason of absence abroad, or illness, was unable\r\nto attend in court. His statement was taken down in writing, in\r\nthe presence of persons expressly appointed to receive it, and\r\nafterwards, upon their swearing to its identity, was read as evidence\r\nin the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nĒDICTUM. The _Jus Edicendi_, or power of making edicts, belonged\r\nto the higher _magistratus populi Romani_, but it was principally\r\nexercised by the two praetors, the praetor urbanus, and the praetor\r\nperegrinus, whose jurisdiction was exercised in the provinces by the\r\npraeses. The curule aediles likewise made many edicts; and tribunes,\r\ncensors, and pontifices also promulgated edicts relating to the\r\nmatters of their respective jurisdictions. The edicta were among\r\nthe sources of Roman law. The edictum may be described generally\r\nas a rule promulgated by a magistratus on entering on his office,\r\nwhich was done by writing it on an album and exhibiting it in a\r\nconspicuous place. As the office of a magistratus was annual, the\r\nrules promulgated by a predecessor were not binding on a successor,\r\nbut he might confirm or adopt the rules of his predecessor, and\r\nintroduce them into his own edict, and hence such adopted rules were\r\ncalled _edictum ralatitium_, or _vetus_, as opposed to _edictum\r\nnovum_. A _repentinum edictum_ was that rule which was made (_prout\r\nres incidit_) for the occasion. A _perpetuum edictum_ was that rule\r\nwhich was made by the magistratus on entering upon office, and which\r\nwas intended to apply to all cases to which it was applicable during\r\nthe year of his office: hence it was sometimes called also _annua\r\nlex_. Until it became the practice for magistratus to adopt the\r\nedicta of their predecessors, the edicta could not form a body of\r\npermanent binding rules; but when this practice became common, the\r\nedicta (_edictum tralatitium_) soon constituted a large body of law,\r\nwhich was practically of as much importance as any other part of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nEICOSTĒ (εἰκοστή), a tax or duty of one-twentieth (five per cent.)\r\nupon all commodities exported or imported by sea in the states of the\r\nallies subject to Athens. This tax was first imposed B.C. 413, in the\r\nplace of the direct tribute which had up to this time been paid by\r\nthe subject allies; and the change was made with the hope of raising\r\na greater revenue. This tax, like all others, was farmed, and the\r\nfarmers of it were called εἰκοστολόγοι.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIRĒN or ĪRĒN (εἴρην or ἴρην), the name given to the Spartan youth\r\nwhen he attained the age of twenty. At the age of eighteen he emerged\r\nfrom childhood, and was called μελλείρην. When he had attained his\r\ntwentieth year, he began to exercise a direct influence over his\r\njuniors, and was entrusted with the command of troops in battle. The\r\nword appears to have originally signified a commander. The ἰρένες\r\nmentioned in Herodotus, in connection with the battle of Plataeae,\r\nwere certainly not youths, but commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\nEISANGĔLĬA (εἰσαγγελία), signifies, in its primary and most general\r\nsense, a denunciation of any kind, but, much more usually, an\r\ninformation laid before the council or the assembly of the people,\r\nand the consequent impeachment and trial of state criminals at\r\nAthens under novel or extraordinary circumstances. Among these were\r\nthe occasions upon which manifest crimes were alleged to have been\r\ncommitted, and yet of such a nature as the existing laws had failed\r\nto anticipate, or at least describe specifically (ἄγραφα ἀδικήματα),\r\nthe result of which omission would have been, but for the enactment\r\nby which the accusations in question might be preferred (νόμος\r\nεἰσαγγελτικός), that a prosecutor would not have known to what\r\nmagistrate to apply; that a magistrate, if applied to, could not with\r\nsafety have accepted the indictment or brought it into court; and\r\nthat, in short, there would have been a total failure of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nEISITĒRĬA (εἰσιτήρια, _scil._ ἱερά), sacrifices offered at Athens by\r\nthe senate before the session began, in honour of the Θεοὶ Βουλαῖοι,\r\n_i.e._ Zeus and Athena.\r\n\r\n\r\nEISPHŎRA (εἰσφορά), an extraordinary tax on property, raised at\r\nAthens, whenever the means of the state were not sufficient to\r\ncarry on a war. It is not quite certain when this property-tax was\r\nintroduced; but it seems to have come first into general use about\r\nB.C. 428. It could never be raised without a decree of the people,\r\nwho also assigned the amount required; and the _strategi_, or\r\ngenerals, superintended its collection, and presided in the courts\r\nwhere disputes connected with, or arising from, the levying of the\r\ntax were settled. The usual expressions for paying this property-tax\r\nare: εἰσφέρειν χρήματα, εἰσφέρειν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, εἰς τὴν σωτηρίαν\r\nτῆς πόλεως, εἰσφορὰς εἰσφέρειν, and those who paid it were called οἱ\r\nεἰσφέροντες. The census of Solon was at first the standard according\r\nto which the _eisphora_ was raised, until in B.C. 377 a new census\r\nwas instituted, in which the people, for the purpose of fixing the\r\nrates of the property-tax, were divided into a number of symmoriae\r\n(συμμορίαι) or classes, similar to those which were afterwards made\r\nfor the trierarchy. Each of the ten tribes or phylae, appointed\r\n120 of its wealthier citizens; and the whole number of persons\r\nincluded in the symmoriae was thus 1200, who were considered as the\r\nrepresentatives of the whole republic. This body of 1200 was divided\r\ninto four classes, each consisting of 300. The first class, or the\r\nrichest, were the leaders of the symmoriae (ἡγεμόνες συμμοριῶν),\r\nand are often called the three hundred. They probably conducted the\r\nproceedings of the symmoriae, and they, or, which is more likely,\r\nthe demarchs, had to value the taxable property. Other officers\r\nwere appointed to make out the lists of the rates, and were called\r\nἐπιγραφεῖς, διαγραφεῖς or ἐκλογεῖς. When the wants of the state were\r\npressing, the 300 leaders advanced the money to the others, who paid\r\nit back to the 300 at the regular time. The first class probably\r\nconsisted of persons who possessed property from 12 talents upwards;\r\nthe second class, of persons who possessed property from 6 talents\r\nand upwards, but under 12; the third class, of persons who possessed\r\nproperty from 2 talents upwards, but under 6; the fourth class, of\r\npersons who possessed property from 25 minae upwards, but under 2\r\ntalents. The rate of taxation was higher or lower according to the\r\nwants of the republic at the time; we have accounts of rates of a\r\n12th, a 50th, a 100th, and a 500th part of the taxable property.\r\nIf any one thought that his property was taxed higher than that of\r\nanother man on whom juster claims could be made, he had the right to\r\ncall upon this person to take the office in his stead, or to submit\r\nto a complete exchange of property. [ANTIDOSIS.] No Athenian, on\r\nthe other hand, if belonging to the tax-paying classes, could be\r\nexempt from the _eisphora_, not even the descendants of Harmodius and\r\nAristogeiton.\r\n\r\n\r\nĒLECTRUM (ἤλεκτρος and ἤλεκτρον), is used by the ancient writers\r\nin two different senses, either for _amber_ or for a mixture of\r\nmetals composed of gold and silver. In Homer and Hesiod, it has, in\r\nall probability, the former meaning. The earliest passage of any\r\nGreek writer, in which the word is _certainly_ used for the metal,\r\nis in the _Antigone_ of Sophocles (1038). This alludes to _native\r\nelectrum_; but the compound was also made artificially. Pliny\r\nstates that when gold contains a fifth part of silver, it is called\r\n_electrum_; that it is found in veins of gold; and that it is also\r\nmade by art: if, he adds, it contains more than a fifth of silver, it\r\nbecomes too brittle to be malleable. But Isidorus mentions electrum\r\ncomposed of _three_ parts gold, and _one_ of silver. Electrum was\r\nused for plate, and the other similar purposes for which gold and\r\nsilver were employed. It was also used as a material for money.\r\nLampridius tells us, that Alexander Severus struck coins of it;\r\nand coins are in existence, of this metal, struck by the kings of\r\nBosporus, by Syracuse, and by other Greek states.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔLEUSĪNĬA (ἐλευσίνια), a festival and mysteries, originally\r\ncelebrated only at Eleusis in Attica, in honour of Demeter and\r\nPersephone. The Eleusinian mysteries, or _the_ mysteries, as they\r\nwere sometimes called, were the holiest and most venerable of all\r\nthat were celebrated in Greece. Various traditions were current among\r\nthe Greeks respecting the author of these mysteries: for, while some\r\nconsidered Eumolpus or Musaeus to be their founder, others stated\r\nthat they had been introduced from Egypt by Erechtheus, who at a time\r\nof scarcity provided his country with corn from Egypt, and imported\r\nfrom the same quarter the sacred rites and mysteries of Eleusis.\r\nA third tradition attributed the institution to Demeter herself,\r\nwho, when wandering about in search of her daughter, Persephone,\r\nwas believed to have come to Attica, in the reign of Erechtheus,\r\nto have supplied its inhabitants with corn, and to have instituted\r\nthe mysteries at Eleusis. This last opinion seems to have been the\r\nmost common among the ancients, and in subsequent times a stone was\r\nshown near the well Callichoros at Eleusis, on which the goddess,\r\noverwhelmed with grief and fatigue, was believed to have rested on\r\nher arrival in Attica. All the accounts and allusions in ancient\r\nwriters seem to warrant the conclusion, that the legends concerning\r\nthe introduction of the Eleusinia are descriptions of a period when\r\nthe inhabitants of Attica were becoming acquainted with the benefits\r\nof agriculture, and of a regularly constituted form of society.--In\r\nthe reign of Erechtheus a war is said to have broken out between\r\nthe Athenians and Eleusinians; and when the latter were defeated,\r\nthey acknowledged the supremacy of Athens in everything except the\r\nmysteries, which they wished to conduct and regulate for themselves.\r\nThus the superintendence remained with the descendants of Eumolpus\r\n[EUMOLPIDAE], the daughters of the Eleusinian king Celeus, and a\r\nthird class of priests, the Ceryces, who seem likewise to have been\r\nconnected with the family of Eumolpus, though they themselves traced\r\ntheir origin to Hermes and Aglauros.--At the time when the local\r\ngovernments of the several townships of Attica were concentrated at\r\nAthens, the capital became also the centre of religion, and several\r\ndeities who had hitherto only enjoyed a local worship, were now\r\nraised to the rank of national gods. This seems also to have been\r\nthe case with the Eleusinian goddess, for in the reign of Theseus we\r\nfind mention of a temple at Athens, called Eleusinion, probably the\r\nnew and national sanctuary of Demeter. Her priests and priestesses\r\nnow became naturally attached to the national temple of the capital,\r\nthough her original place of worship at Eleusis, with which so many\r\nsacred associations were connected, still retained its importance and\r\nits special share in the celebration of the national solemnities.--We\r\nmust distinguish between the greater Eleusinia, which were celebrated\r\nat Athens and Eleusis, and the lesser, which were held at Agrae\r\non the Ilissus. The lesser Eleusinia were only a preparation\r\n(προκάθαρσις or προάγνευσις) for the real mysteries. They were held\r\nevery year in the month of Anthesterion, and, according to some\r\naccounts, in honour of Persephone alone. Those who were initiated in\r\nthem bore the name of _Mystae_ (μύσται), and had to wait at least\r\nanother year before they could be admitted to the great mysteries.\r\nThe principal rites of this first stage of initiation consisted in\r\nthe sacrifice of a sow, which the mystae seem to have first washed\r\nin the Cantharus, and in the purification by a priest, who bore\r\nthe name of _Hydranos_ (Ὑδρανός). The mystae had also to take an\r\noath of secrecy, which was administered to them by the _Mystagogus_\r\n(μυσταγωγός, also called ἱεροφάντης or προφήτης), and they received\r\nsome kind of preparatory instruction, which enabled them afterwards\r\nto understand the mysteries which were revealed to them in the\r\ngreat Eleusinia.--The great mysteries were celebrated every year in\r\nthe month of Boedromion, during nine days, from the 15th to the\r\n23rd, both at Athens and Eleusis. The initiated were called ἐπόπται\r\nor ἔφυροι. On the first day, those who had been initiated in the\r\nlesser Eleusinia, assembled at Athens. On the second day the mystae\r\nwent in solemn procession to the sea-coast, where they underwent\r\na purification. Of the third day scarcely anything is known with\r\ncertainty; we are only told that it was a day of fasting, and that in\r\nthe evening a frugal meal was taken, which consisted of cakes made\r\nof sesame and honey. On the fourth day the καλάθος κάθοδος seems to\r\nhave taken place. This was a procession with a basket containing\r\npomegranates and poppy-seeds; it was carried on a waggon drawn by\r\noxen, and women followed with small mystic cases in their hands.\r\nOn the fifth day, which appears to have been called the torch day\r\n(ἡ τῶν λαμπάδων ἡμέρα), the mystae, led by the δᾳδοῦχος, went in\r\nthe evening with torches to the temple of Demeter at Eleusis, where\r\nthey seem to have remained during the following night. This rite was\r\nprobably a symbolical representation of Demeter wandering about in\r\nsearch of Persephone. The sixth day, called _Iacchos_, was the most\r\nsolemn of all. The statue of Iacchos, son of Demeter, adorned with a\r\ngarland of myrtle and bearing a torch in his hand, was carried along\r\nthe sacred road amidst joyous shouts and songs, from the Cerameicus\r\nto Eleusis. This solemn procession was accompanied by great numbers\r\nof followers and spectators. During the night from the sixth to\r\nthe seventh day the mystae remained at Eleusis, and were initiated\r\ninto the last mysteries (ἐποπτεία). Those who were neither ἐπόπται\r\nnor μύσται were sent away by a herald. The mystae now repeated the\r\noath of secrecy which had been administered to them at the lesser\r\nEleusinia, underwent a new purification, and then they were led by\r\nthe mystagogus in the darkness of night into the lighted interior\r\nof the sanctuary (φωταγωγία), and were allowed to see (αὐτοψία)\r\nwhat none except the epoptae ever beheld. The awful and horrible\r\nmanner in which the initiation is described by later, especially\r\nChristian writers, seems partly to proceed from their ignorance of\r\nits real character, partly from their horror of and aversion to\r\nthese pagan rites. The more ancient writers always abstained from\r\nentering upon any description of the subject. Each individual, after\r\nhis initiation, is said to have been dismissed by the words κόγξ,\r\nὄμπαξ, in order to make room for other mystae. On the seventh day\r\nthe initiated returned to Athens amid various kinds of raillery and\r\njests, especially at the bridge over the Cephisus, where they sat\r\ndown to rest, and poured forth their ridicule on those who passed\r\nby. Hence the words γεφυρίζειν and γεφυρισμός. These σκώμματα seem,\r\nlike the procession with torches to Eleusis, to have been dramatical\r\nand symbolical representations of the jests by which, according to\r\nthe ancient legend, Iambe or Baubo had dispelled the grief of the\r\ngoddess and made her smile. We may here observe, that probably the\r\nwhole history of Demeter and Persephone was in some way or other\r\nsymbolically represented at the Eleusinia. The eighth day, called\r\n_Epidauria_ (Ἐπιδαύρια), was a kind of additional day for those\r\nwho by some accident had come too late, or had been prevented from\r\nbeing initiated on the sixth day. It was said to have been added\r\nto the original number of days, when Asclepius, coming over from\r\nEpidaurus to be initiated, arrived too late, and the Athenians, not\r\nto disappoint the god, added an eighth day. The ninth and last day\r\nbore the name of πλημοχοαί, from a peculiar kind of vessel called\r\nπλημοχοή, which is described as a small kind of κότυλος. Two of these\r\nvessels were on this day filled with water or wine, and the contents\r\nof the one thrown to the east, and those of the other to the west,\r\nwhile those who performed this rite uttered some mystical words.--The\r\nEleusinian mysteries long survived the independence of Greece.\r\nAttempts to suppress them were made by the emperor Valentinian, but\r\nhe met with strong opposition, and they seem to have continued down\r\nto the time of the elder Theodosius. Respecting the secret doctrines\r\nwhich were revealed in them to the initiated, nothing certain is\r\nknown. The general belief of the ancients was, that they opened to\r\nman a comforting prospect of a future state. But this feature does\r\nnot seem to have been originally connected with these mysteries, and\r\nwas probably added to them at the period which followed the opening\r\nof a regular intercourse between Greece and Egypt, when some of the\r\nspeculative doctrines of the latter country, and of the East, may\r\nhave been introduced into the mysteries, and hallowed by the names of\r\nthe venerable bards of the mythical age. This supposition would also\r\naccount, in some measure, for the legend of their introduction from\r\nEgypt. In modern times many attempts have been made to discover the\r\nnature of the mysteries revealed to the initiated, but the results\r\nhave been as various and as fanciful as might be expected. The most\r\nsober and probable view is that, according to which, “they were\r\nthe remains of a worship which preceded the rise of the Hellenic\r\nmythology and its attendant rites, grounded on a view of nature,\r\nless fanciful, more earnest, and better fitted to awaken both\r\nphilosophical thought and religious feeling.”\r\n\r\n\r\nĔLEUTHĔRĬA (ἐλευθέρια), the feast of liberty, a festival which the\r\nGreeks, after the battle of Plataeae (479 B.C.), instituted in honour\r\nof Zeus Eleutherios (the deliverer). It was intended not merely\r\nto be a token of their gratitude to the god to whom they believed\r\nthemselves to be indebted for their victory over the barbarians, but\r\nalso as a bond of union among themselves; for, in an assembly of all\r\nthe Greeks, Aristeides carried a decree that delegates (πρόβουλοι\r\nκαὶ θεωροί) from all the Greek states should assemble every year\r\nat Plataeae for the celebration of the Eleutheria. The town itself\r\nwas at the same time declared sacred and inviolable, as long as its\r\ncitizens offered the annual sacrifices which were then instituted on\r\nbehalf of Greece. Every fifth year these solemnities were celebrated\r\nwith contests, in which the victors were rewarded with chaplets.\r\n\r\n\r\nELLŌTĬA or HELLŌTĬA (ἐλλώτια or ἑλλώτια), a festival with a torch\r\nrace celebrated at Corinth in honour of Athena as a goddess of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nĒMANCĬPĀTĬO, was an act by which the _patria potestas_ was dissolved\r\nin the lifetime of the parent, and it was so called because it was in\r\nthe form of a sale (_mancipatio_). By the laws of the Twelve Tables\r\nit was necessary that a son should be sold three times in order to\r\nbe released from the paternal power, or to be _sui juris_. In the\r\ncase of daughters and grandchildren, one sale was sufficient. The\r\nfather transferred the son by the form of a sale to another person,\r\nwho manumitted him, upon which he returned into the power of the\r\nfather. This was repeated, and with the like result. After a third\r\nsale, the paternal power was extinguished, but the son was re-sold to\r\nthe parent, who then manumitted him, and so acquired the rights of a\r\npatron over his emancipated son, which would otherwise have belonged\r\nto the purchaser who gave him his final manumission.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBAS (ἐμβάς), a shoe worn by men, and which appears to have been\r\nthe most common kind of shoe worn at Athens. Pollux says that it was\r\ninvented by the Thracians, and that it was like the low cothurnus.\r\nThe _embas_ was also worn by the Boeotians, and probably in other\r\nparts of Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBĂTEIA (ἐμβατεία). In Attic law this word (like the corresponding\r\nEnglish one, _entry_), was used to denote a formal taking possession\r\nof real property. Thus, when a son entered upon the land left him\r\nby his father, he was said ἐμβατεύειν or βαδίζειν εἰς τὰ πατρῳα,\r\nand thereupon he became _seised_, or possessed of his inheritance.\r\nIf any one disturbed him in the enjoyment of this property, with\r\nan intention to dispute the title, he might maintain an action of\r\nejectment, ἐξούλης δίκη. Before entry he could not maintain such\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBLĒMA (ἔμβλημα, ἔμπαισμα), an inlaid ornament. The art of inlaying\r\nwas employed in producing beautiful works of two descriptions,\r\nviz.;--1st, those which resembled our marquetry, buhl, and Florentine\r\nmosaics; and 2dly, those in which crusts (_crustae_), exquisitely\r\nwrought in bas-relief and of precious materials, were fastened upon\r\nthe surface of vessels or other pieces of furniture. To the latter\r\nclass of productions belonged the cups and plates which Verres\r\nobtained by violence from the Sicilians, and from which he removed\r\nthe emblems for the purpose of having them set in gold instead of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n\r\nĒMĔRĬTI, the name given to those Roman soldiers who had served out\r\ntheir time, and had exemption (_vacatio_) from military service. The\r\nusual time of service was twenty years for the legionary soldiers,\r\nand sixteen for the praetorians. At the end of their period of\r\nservice they received a bounty or reward (_emeritum_), either in\r\nlands or money, or in both.\r\n\r\n\r\nĒMISSĀRĬUM (ὑπόνομος), a channel, natural or artificial, by which\r\nan outlet is formed to carry off any stagnant body of water. Such\r\nchannels may be either open or underground; but the most remarkable\r\nworks of the kind are of the latter description, as they carry off\r\nthe waters of lakes surrounded by hills. In Greece, the most striking\r\nexample is presented by the subterraneous channels which carry off\r\nthe waters of the lake Copais in Boeotia, which were partly natural\r\nand partly artificial. Some works of this kind are among the most\r\nremarkable efforts of Roman ingenuity. Remains still exist to show\r\nthat the lakes Trasimene, Albano, Nemi, and Fucino, were all drained\r\nby means of _emissaria_, the last of which is still nearly perfect,\r\nand open to inspection, having been partially cleared by the present\r\nking of Naples. Julius Caesar is said to have first conceived the\r\nidea of this stupendous undertaking, which was carried into effect by\r\nthe Emperor Claudius.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMĒNI DĬKAE (ἔμμηνοι δίκαι), suits in the Athenian courts, which\r\nwere not allowed to be pending above a month. This regulation was\r\nconfined to those subjects which required a speedy decision; and of\r\nthese the most important were disputes respecting commerce (ἐμπορικαὶ\r\nδίκαι). All causes relating to mines (μεταλλικαὶ δίκαι) were also\r\nἔμμηνοι δίκαι, as well as those relating to ἔρανοι. [ERANI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPŎRĬUM (τὸ ἐμπόριον), a place for wholesale trade in commodities\r\ncarried by sea. The name is sometimes applied to a sea-port town,\r\nbut it properly signifies only a particular place in such a town.\r\nThe word is derived from ἔμπορος, which signifies in Homer a person\r\nwho sails as a passenger in a ship belonging to another person; but\r\nin later writers it signifies the merchant or wholesale dealer, and\r\ndiffers from κάπηλος, the retail dealer. The emporium at Athens was\r\nunder the inspection of certain officers, who were elected annually\r\n(ἐπιμεληταὶ τοῦ ἐμπορίου).\r\n\r\n\r\nENCAUSTĬCA. [PICTURA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nENCTĒSIS (ἔγκτησις), the right of possessing landed property and\r\nhouses (ἔγκτησις γῆς καὶ οἰκίας) in a foreign country, which was\r\nfrequently granted by one Greek state to another, or to separate\r\nindividuals of another state. Ἐγκτήματα were such possessions in\r\na foreign country, or in a different δῆμος from that to which an\r\nAthenian belonged by birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDEIXIS (ἔνδειξις), properly denotes a prosecution instituted\r\nagainst such persons as were alleged to have exercised rights or\r\nheld offices while labouring under a peculiar disqualification.\r\nThe same form of action was available against the chairman of the\r\nproedri (ἐπιστάτης), who wrongly refused to take the votes of the\r\npeople in the assembly; against malefactors, especially murderers;\r\ntraitors, ambassadors accused of malversation, and persons who\r\nfurnished supplies to the enemy during war. The first step taken by\r\nthe prosecutor was to lay his information in writing, also called\r\n_endeixis_, before the proper magistrate, who then arrested, or\r\nheld to bail, the person criminated, and took the usual steps for\r\nbringing him to trial. There is great obscurity with respect to the\r\npunishment which followed condemnation. The accuser, if unsuccessful,\r\nwas responsible for bringing a malicious charge (ψευδοῦς ἐνδείξεως\r\nὑπεύθυνος).\r\n\r\n\r\nENDRŎMIS (ἐνδρομίς), a thick, coarse blanket, manufactured in Gaul,\r\nand called “endromis” because those who had been exercising in the\r\nstadium (ἐν δρόμῳ) threw it over them to obviate the effects of\r\nsudden exposure when they were heated. Notwithstanding its coarse and\r\nshaggy appearance, it was worn on other occasions as a protection\r\nfrom the cold by rich and fashionable persons at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nENSIS. [GLADIUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nENTĂSIS (ἔντασις). The most ancient columns now existing, diminish\r\nimmediately and regularly from the base to the neck, so that the\r\nedge forms a straight line--a mode of construction which is wanting\r\nin grace and apparent solidity. To correct this, a swelling outline,\r\ncalled _entasis_, was given to the shaft, which seems to have been\r\nthe first step towards combining grace and grandeur in the Doric\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPANGĔLĬA (ἐπαγγελία). If a citizen of Athens had incurred _atimia_,\r\nthe privilege of taking part or speaking in the public assembly was\r\nforfeited. But as it sometimes might happen that a person, though not\r\nformally declared _atimus_, had committed such crimes as would, on\r\naccusation, draw upon him this punishment, it was of course desirable\r\nthat such individuals, like real _atimi_, should be excluded from\r\nthe exercise of the rights of citizens. Whenever, therefore, such\r\na person ventured to speak in the assembly, any Athenian citizen\r\nhad the right to come forward in the assembly itself and demand of\r\nhim to establish his right to speak by a trial or examination of\r\nhis conduct (δοκιμασία τοῦ βίου), and this demand, denouncement, or\r\nthreat, was called _epangelia_, or _epangelia docimasias_ (ἐπαγγελία\r\nδοκιμασίας). The impeached individual was then compelled to desist\r\nfrom speaking, and to submit to a scrutiny into his conduct, and, if\r\nhe was convicted, a formal declaration of _atimia_ followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPARITI (ἐπάριτοι), the name of the standing army in Arcadia, which\r\nwas formed to preserve the independence of the Arcadian towns, when\r\nthey became united as one state after the defeat of the Spartans at\r\nLeuctra. They were 5000 in number, and were paid by the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPHĒBUS (ἔφηβος), the name of Athenian youths after they had\r\nattained the age of 18. The state of _ephebeia_ (ἐφηβεία) lasted for\r\ntwo years, till the youths had attained the age of 20, when they\r\nbecame men, and were admitted to share all the rights and duties of\r\ncitizens, for which the law did not prescribe a more advanced age.\r\nBefore a youth was enrolled among the ephebi, he had to undergo a\r\n_docimasia_ (δοκιμασία), the object of which was partly to ascertain\r\nwhether he was the son of Athenian citizens, or adopted by a citizen,\r\nand partly whether his body was sufficiently developed and strong\r\nto undertake the duties which now devolved upon him. After the\r\n_docimasia_ the young men received in the assembly a shield and a\r\nlance; but those whose fathers had fallen in the defence of their\r\ncountry received a complete suit of armour in the theatre. It seems\r\nto have been on this occasion that the ephebi took an oath in the\r\ntemple of Artemis Aglauros, by which they pledged themselves never\r\nto disgrace their arms or to desert their comrades; to fight to\r\nthe last in the defence of their country, its altars and hearths;\r\nto leave their country not in a worse but in a better state than\r\nthey found it; to obey the magistrates and the laws; to resist\r\nall attempts to subvert the institutions of Attica; and finally,\r\nto respect the religion of their forefathers. This solemnity took\r\nplace towards the close of the year, and the festive season bore the\r\nname of _ephebia_ (ἐφήβια). The external distinction of the ephebi\r\nconsisted in the chlamys and the petasus. During the two years of\r\nthe ephebeia, which may be considered as a kind of apprenticeship in\r\narms, and in which the young men prepared themselves for the higher\r\nduties of full citizens, they were generally sent into the country,\r\nunder the name of _peripoli_ (περίπολοι), to keep watch in the towns\r\nand fortresses, on the coast and frontier, and to perform other\r\nduties which might be necessary for the protection of Attica.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPHĒGĒSIS (ἐφήγησις), denotes the method of proceeding against such\r\ncriminals as were liable to be summarily arrested by a private\r\ncitizen [APAGOGE] when the prosecutor was unwilling to expose\r\nhimself to personal risk in apprehending the offender. Under these\r\ncircumstances he made an application to the proper magistrate, and\r\nconducted him and his officers to the spot where the capture was to\r\nbe effected.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPHĔTAE (ἐφέται), the name of certain judges at Athens, who tried\r\ncases of homicide. They were fifty-one in number, selected from noble\r\nfamilies, and more than fifty years of age. They formed a tribunal\r\nof great antiquity, and were in existence before the legislation of\r\nSolon, but, as the state became more and more democratical, their\r\nduties became unimportant and almost antiquated. The Ephetae once sat\r\nin one or other of the five courts, according to the nature of the\r\ncauses they had to try. In historical times, however, they sat in\r\n_four_ only, called respectively the court by the Palladium (τὸ ἐπὶ\r\nΠαλλαδίῳ), by the Delphinium (τὸ ἐπὶ Δελφινίῳ), by the Prytaneium (τὸ\r\nἐπὶ Πρυτανείῳ), and the court at Phreatto or Zea (τὸ ἐν Φρεαττοῖ). At\r\nthe first of these courts they tried cases of unintentional, at the\r\nsecond, of intentional but justifiable homicide. At the Prytaneium,\r\nby a strange custom, somewhat analogous to the imposition of a\r\ndeodand, they passed sentence upon the instrument of murder when\r\nthe perpetrator of the act was not known. In the court at Phreatto,\r\non the sea shore at the Peiraeeus, they tried such persons as were\r\ncharged with wilful murder during a temporary exile for unintentional\r\nhomicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ephippium, Saddle. (Coin of Labienus.)]\r\n\r\nĔPHIPPĬUM (ἀστράβη, ἐφίππιον, ἐφίππειον), a saddle. Although the\r\nGreeks occasionally rode without any saddle, yet they commonly used\r\none, and from them the name, together with the thing, was borrowed by\r\nthe Romans. The ancient saddles appear, indeed, to have been thus far\r\ndifferent from ours, that the cover stretched upon the hard frame was\r\nprobably of stuffed or padded cloth rather than leather, and that the\r\nsaddle was, as it were, a cushion fitted to the horse’s back. Pendent\r\ncloths (στρώματα, _strata_) were always attached to it so as to cover\r\nthe sides of the animal; but it was not provided with stirrups. The\r\nsaddle with the pendent cloths is exhibited in the annexed coin. The\r\nterm “Ephippium” was in later times in part supplanted by the word\r\n“sella,” and the more specific expression “sella equestris.”\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPHŎRI (ἔφοροι). Magistrates called _Ephori_ or overseers were common\r\nto many Dorian constitutions in times of remote antiquity; but the\r\nEphori of Sparta are the most celebrated of them all. The origin\r\nof the Spartan ephori is quite uncertain, but their office in the\r\nhistorical times was a kind of counterpoise to the kings and council,\r\nand in that respect peculiar to Sparta alone of the Dorian states.\r\nTheir number, five, appears to have been always the same, and was\r\nprobably connected with the five divisions of the town of Sparta,\r\nnamely, the four κῶμαι, Limnae, Mesoa, Pitana, Cynosura, and the\r\nΠόλις or city properly so called, around which the κῶμαι lay. They\r\nwere elected from and by the people, without any qualification of age\r\nor property, and without undergoing any scrutiny; so that the people\r\nenjoyed through them a participation in the highest magistracy of\r\nthe state. They entered upon office at the autumnal solstice, and\r\nthe first in rank of the five gave his name to the year, which was\r\ncalled after him in all civil transactions. They possessed judicial\r\nauthority in civil suits, and also a general superintendence over\r\nthe morals and domestic economy of the nation, which in the hands\r\nof able men would soon prove an instrument of unlimited power.\r\nTheir jurisdiction and power were still further increased by the\r\nprivilege of instituting scrutinies (εὔθυναι) into the conduct of all\r\nthe magistrates. Even the kings themselves could be brought before\r\ntheir tribunal (as Cleomenes was for bribery). In extreme cases, the\r\nephors were also competent to lay an accusation against the kings\r\nas well as the other magistrates, and bring them to a capital trial\r\nbefore the great court of justice. In later times the power of the\r\nephors was greatly increased; and this increase appears to have been\r\nprincipally owing to the fact, that they put themselves in connection\r\nwith the assembly of the people, convened its meetings, laid measures\r\nbefore it, and were constituted its agents and representatives.\r\nWhen this connection arose is matter of conjecture. The power which\r\nsuch a connection gave would, more than anything else, enable them\r\nto encroach on the royal authority, and make themselves virtually\r\nsupreme in the state. Accordingly, we find that they transacted\r\nbusiness with foreign ambassadors; dismissed them from the state;\r\ndecided upon the government of dependent cities; subscribed in the\r\npresence of other persons to treaties of peace; and in time of war\r\nsent out troops when they thought necessary. In all these capacities\r\nthe ephors acted as the representatives of the nation, and the agents\r\nof the public assembly, being in fact the executive of the state. In\r\ncourse of time the kings became completely under their control. For\r\nexample, they fined Agesilaus on the vague charge of trying to make\r\nhimself popular, and interfered even with the domestic arrangements\r\nof other kings. In the field the kings were followed by two ephors,\r\nwho belonged to the council of war; the three who remained at home\r\nreceived the booty in charge, and paid it into the treasury, which\r\nwas under the superintendence of the whole College of Five. But\r\nthe ephors had still another prerogative, based on a religious\r\nfoundation, which enabled them to effect a temporary deposition of\r\nthe kings. Once in eight years, as we are told, they chose a calm\r\nand cloudless night to observe the heavens, and if there was any\r\nappearance of a falling meteor, it was believed to be a sign that the\r\ngods were displeased with the kings, who were accordingly suspended\r\nfrom their functions until an oracle allowed of their restoration.\r\nThe outward symbols of supreme authority also were assumed by the\r\nephors; and they alone kept their seats while the kings passed;\r\nwhereas it was not considered below the dignity of the kings to rise\r\nin honour of the ephors. When Agis and Cleomenes undertook to restore\r\nthe old constitution, it was necessary for them to overthrow the\r\nephoralty, and accordingly Cleomenes murdered the ephors for the time\r\nbeing, and abolished the office (B.C. 225); it was, however, restored\r\nunder the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPĬBĂTAE (ἐπιβάται), were soldiers or marines appointed to defend the\r\nvessels in the Athenian navy, and were entirely distinct from the\r\nrowers, and also from the land soldiers, such as hoplitae, peltasts,\r\nand cavalry. It appears that the ordinary number of epibatae on\r\nboard a trireme was ten. The epibatae were usually taken from the\r\nthetes, or fourth class of Athenian citizens. The term is sometimes\r\nalso applied by the Roman writers to the marines, but they are more\r\nusually called _classiarii milites_. The latter term, however, is\r\nalso applied to the rowers or sailors as well as the marines.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPĬBŎLĒ (ἐπιβολή), a fine imposed by a magistrate, or other official\r\nperson or body, for a misdemeanour. The various magistrates at Athens\r\nhad (each in his own department) a summary penal jurisdiction;\r\n_i.e._ for certain offences they might inflict a pecuniary mulct\r\nor fine, not exceeding a fixed amount; if the offender deserved\r\nfurther punishment, it was their duty to bring him before a judicial\r\ntribunal. These _epibolae_ are to be distinguished from the\r\npenalties awarded by a jury or court of law (τιμήματα) upon a formal\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPĬCLĒRUS (ἐπίκληρος, heiress), the name given to the daughter of\r\nan Athenian citizen, who had no son to inherit his estate. It was\r\ndeemed an object of importance at Athens to preserve the family\r\nname and property of every citizen. This was effected, where a man\r\nhad no child, by adoption (εἰσποίησις); if he had a daughter, the\r\ninheritance was transmitted through her to a grandson, who would take\r\nthe name of the maternal ancestor. If the father died intestate,\r\nthe heiress had not the choice of a husband, but was bound to marry\r\nher nearest relation, not in the ascending line. When there was but\r\none daughter, she was called ἐπίκληρος ἐπὶ παντὶ τῷ οἴκῳ. If there\r\nwere more, they inherited equally, like our co-parceners; and were\r\nseverally married to relatives, the nearest having the first choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPĬDŎSEIS (ἐπιδόσεις), voluntary contributions, either in money,\r\narms, or ships, which were made by the Athenian citizens in order\r\nto meet the extraordinary demands of the state. When the expenses\r\nof the state were greater than its revenue, it was usual for the\r\nprytaneis to summon an assembly of the people, and after explaining\r\nthe necessities of the state, to call upon the citizens to contribute\r\naccording to their means. Those who were willing to contribute then\r\nrose and mentioned what they would give; while those who were\r\nunwilling to give any thing remained silent, or retired privately\r\nfrom the assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPĬMĔLĒTAE (ἐπιμεληταί), the names of various magistrates and\r\nfunctionaries at Athens.--(1) Ἐπιμελητὴς τῆς κοινῆς προσόδου, more\r\nusually called ταμίας, the treasurer or manager of the public\r\nrevenue. [TAMIAS.]--(2) Ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν μοριῶν Ἐλαιῶν, were persons\r\nchosen from among the Areopagites to take care of the sacred olive\r\ntrees.--(3) Ἐπιμεληταὶ τοῦ Ἐμπορίου, were the overseers of the\r\nemporium. [EMPORIUM.] They were ten in number, and were elected\r\nyearly by lot. They had the entire management of the emporium,\r\nand had jurisdiction in all breaches of the commercial laws.--(4)\r\nἘπιμεληταὶ τῶν Μυστηρίων, were, in connection with the king archon,\r\nthe managers of the Eleusinian mysteries. They were elected by open\r\nvote, and were four in number.--(5) Ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν νεωρίων, the\r\ninspectors of the dockyards, were ten in number.--(6) Ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν\r\nφυλῶν, the inspectors of the φυλαὶ or tribes. [TRIBUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPISCŎPI (ἐπίσκοποι), inspectors, who were sometimes sent by the\r\nAthenians to subject states. They were also called φύλακες. It\r\nappears that these Episcopi received a salary at the cost of the\r\ncities over which they presided.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPISTĂTĒS (ἐπιστάτης).--(1) The chairman of the senate and assembly\r\nof the people, respecting whose duties see BOULÉ and ECCLESIA.--(2)\r\nThe name of the directors of the public works. (Ἐπισταταὶ τῶν\r\nδημοσίων ἔργων).\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPISTŎLEUS (ἐπιστολεύς), the officer second in rank in the Spartan\r\nfleet, who succeeded to the command if any thing happened to the\r\n_navarchus_ (ναυάρχος) or admiral. When the Chians and the other\r\nallies of Sparta on the Asiatic coast sent to Sparta to request that\r\nLysander might be again appointed to the command of the navy, he was\r\nsent with the title of epistoleus, because the laws of Sparta did not\r\npermit the same person to hold the office of navarchus twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPISTȲLĬUM (ἐπιστύλιον), properly, as the name implies, the\r\narchitrave, or lower member of an entablature, which lies immediately\r\nover the columns. The word is sometimes also used for the whole of\r\nthe entablature.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPĬTRŎPUS (ἐπίτροπος), the name at Athens of a guardian of orphan\r\nchildren. Of such guardians there were at Athens three kinds: first,\r\nthose appointed in the will of the deceased father; secondly, the\r\nnext of kin, whom the law designated as tutores legitimi in default\r\nof such appointment, and who required the authorization of the\r\narchon to enable them to act; and lastly, such persons as the archon\r\nselected if there were no next of kin living to undertake the office.\r\nThe duties of the guardian comprehended the education, maintenance,\r\nand protection of the ward, the assertion of his rights, and the\r\nsafe custody and profitable disposition of his inheritance during\r\nhis minority, besides making a proper provision for the widow if she\r\nremained in the house of her late husband.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPŌBĔLIA (ἐπωβελία), as its etymology implies, at the rate of one\r\nobolus for a drachma, or one in six, was payable on the assessment\r\n(τίμημα) of several private causes, and sometimes in a case of\r\nphasis, by the litigant that failed to obtain the votes of one-fifth\r\nof the dicasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPŌNỸMUS. [ARCHON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPOPTAE (ἐπόπται). [ELEUSINIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPŬLŌNES, who were originally three in number (_triumviri epulones_),\r\nwere first created in B.C. 196, to attend to the Epulum Jovis, and\r\nthe banquets given in honour of the other gods; which duty had\r\noriginally belonged to the pontifices. Their number was afterwards\r\nincreased to seven, and they were called septemviri epulones or\r\nseptemviri epulonum. The epulones formed a collegium, and were one of\r\nthe four great religious corporations at Rome; the other three were\r\nthose of the Pontifices, Augures, and Quindecemviri.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔPŬLUM JŎVIS. [EPULONES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĔQUĪRĬA, horse-races, which are said to have been instituted by\r\nRomulus in honour of Mars, and were celebrated in the Campus Martius.\r\nThere were two festivals of this name; of which one was celebrated\r\nA.D. III. Cal. Mart., and the other prid. Id. Mart.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔQUĬTES, horsemen. Romulus is said to have formed three centuries\r\nof equites; and these were the same as the 300 Celeres, whom he\r\nkept about his person in peace and war. A century was taken from\r\neach of the three tribes, the _Ramnes_, _Titienses_, and _Luceres_.\r\nTarquinius Priscus added three more, under the title of Ramnes,\r\nTitienses, and Luceres _posteriores_. These were the six patrician\r\ncenturies of equites, often referred to under the name of the _sex\r\nsuffragia_. To these Servius Tullius added twelve more centuries, for\r\nadmission into which, property and not birth was the qualification.\r\nThese twelve centuries might therefore contain plebeians, but they\r\ndo not appear to have been restricted to plebeians, since we have\r\nno reason for believing that the six old centuries contained the\r\n_whole_ body of patricians. A property qualification was apparently\r\nalso necessary by the Servian constitution for admission into the\r\nsix centuries. We may therefore suppose that those patricians who\r\nwere included in the six old centuries were allowed by the Servian\r\nconstitution to continue in them, if they possessed the requisite\r\nproperty; and that all other persons in the state, whether patricians\r\nor plebeians, who possessed the requisite property, were admitted\r\ninto the twelve new centuries. We are not told the amount of property\r\nnecessary to entitle a person to a place among the equites, but it\r\nwas probably the same as in the latter times of the republic, that\r\nis, four times that of the first class. [COMITIA, p. 105.] Property,\r\nhowever, was not the only qualification; for in the ancient times\r\nof the republic no one was admitted among the equestrian centuries\r\nunless his character was unblemished, and his father and grandfather\r\nhad been born freemen. Each of the equites received a horse from\r\nthe state (_equus publicus_), or money to purchase one, as well as\r\na sum of money for its annual support; the expense of its support\r\nwas defrayed by the orphans and unmarried females; since, in a\r\nmilitary state, it could not be esteemed unjust, that the women and\r\nthe children were to contribute largely for those who fought in\r\nbehalf of them and of the commonwealth. The purchase-money for a\r\nknight’s horse was called _aes equestre_, and its annual provision\r\n_aes hordearium_. The former amounted, according to Livy, to 10,000\r\nasses, and the latter to 2000.--All the equites, of whom we have\r\nbeen speaking, received a horse from the state, and were included\r\nin the 18 equestrian centuries of the Servian constitution; but\r\nin course of time, we read of another class of equites in Roman\r\nhistory, who did not receive a horse from the state, and who were not\r\nincluded in the 18 centuries. This latter class is first mentioned\r\nby Livy, in his account of the siege of Veii, B.C. 403. He says that\r\nduring the siege, when the Romans had at one time suffered great\r\ndisasters, all those citizens who had an equestrian fortune, and no\r\nhorse allotted to them, volunteered to serve with their own horses;\r\nand he adds, that from this time equites first began to serve with\r\ntheir own horses. The state paid them, as a kind of compensation for\r\nserving with their own horses. The foot soldiers had received pay\r\na few years before; and two years afterwards, B.C. 401, the pay of\r\nthe equites was made three-fold that of the infantry. From the year\r\nB.C. 403, there were therefore two classes of Roman knights: one who\r\nreceived horses from the state, and are therefore frequently called\r\n_equites equo publico_, and sometimes _Flexumines_ or _Trossuli_,\r\nand another class, who served, when they were required, with their\r\nown horses, but were not classed among the 18 centuries. As they\r\nserved on horseback they were called _equites_; and when spoken of in\r\nopposition to cavalry, which did not consist of Roman citizens, they\r\nwere also called _equites Romani_; but they had no legal claim to\r\nthe name of equites, since in ancient times this title was strictly\r\nconfined to those who received horses from the state.--The reason of\r\nthis distinction of two classes arose from the fact, that the number\r\nof equites in the 18 centuries was fixed from the time of Servius\r\nTullius. As vacancies occurred in them, the descendants of those\r\nwho were originally enrolled succeeded to their places, provided\r\nthey had not dissipated their property. But in course of time, as\r\npopulation and wealth increased, the number of persons who possessed\r\nan equestrian fortune, also increased greatly; and as the ancestors\r\nof these persons had not been enrolled in the 18 centuries, they\r\ncould not receive horses from the state, and were therefore allowed\r\nthe privilege of serving with their own horses among the cavalry,\r\ninstead of the infantry, as they would otherwise have been obliged to\r\nhave done.--The inspection of the equites who received horses from\r\nthe state belonged to the censors, who had the power of depriving an\r\neques of his horse, and reducing him to the condition of an aerarian,\r\nand also of giving the vacant horse to the most distinguished of the\r\nequites who had previously served at their own expense. For these\r\npurposes they made during their censorship a public inspection, in\r\nthe forum, of all the knights who possessed public horses (_equitatum\r\nrecognoscere_). The tribes were taken in order, and each knight was\r\nsummoned by name. Every one, as his name was called, walked past\r\nthe censors, leading his horse. If the censors had no fault to find\r\neither with the character of the knight or the equipments of his\r\nhorse, they ordered him to pass on (_traducere equum_); but if on\r\nthe contrary they considered him unworthy of his rank, they struck\r\nhim out of the list of knights, and deprived him of his horse, or\r\nordered him to sell it, with the intention no doubt that the person\r\nthus degraded should refund to the state the money which had been\r\nadvanced to him for its purchase.--This review of the equites by\r\nthe censors must not be confounded with the _Equitum Transvectio_,\r\nwhich was a solemn procession of the body every year on the Ides of\r\nQuintilis (July). The procession started from the temple of Mars\r\noutside the city, and passed through the city over the forum, and by\r\nthe temple of the Dioscuri. On this occasion the equites were always\r\ncrowned with olive chaplets, and wore their state dress, the trabea,\r\nwith all the honourable distinctions which they had gained in battle.\r\nAccording to Livy, this annual procession was first established by\r\nthe censors Q. Fabius and P. Decius, B.C. 304; but according to\r\nDionysius it was instituted after the defeat of the Latins near\r\nthe lake Regillus, of which an account was brought to Rome by the\r\nDioscuri.--It may be asked how long did the knight retain his public\r\nhorse, and a vote in the equestrian century to which he belonged? On\r\nthis subject we have no positive information; but as those equites,\r\nwho served with their own horses, were only obliged to serve for ten\r\nyears (_stipendia_) under the age of 46, we may presume that the same\r\nrule extended to those who served with the public horses, provided\r\nthey _wished_ to give up the service. For it is certain that in the\r\nancient times of the republic a knight might retain his horse as\r\nlong as he pleased, even after he had entered the senate, provided\r\nhe continued able to discharge the duties of a knight. Thus the two\r\ncensors, M. Livius Salinator and C. Claudius Nero, in B.C. 204, were\r\nalso equites, and L. Scipio Asiaticus, who was deprived of his horse\r\nby the censors in B.C. 185, had himself been censor in B.C. 191.\r\nBut during the later times of the republic the knights were obliged\r\nto give up their horses on entering the senate, and consequently\r\nceased to belong to the equestrian centuries. It thus naturally\r\ncame to pass, that the greater number of the equites equo publico,\r\nafter the exclusion of senators from the equestrian centuries, were\r\nyoung men.--The equestrian centuries, of which we have hitherto been\r\ntreating, were only regarded as a division of the army: they did not\r\nform a distinct class or ordo in the constitution. The community,\r\nin a political point of view, was divided only into patricians and\r\nplebeians, and the equestrian centuries were composed of both. But\r\nin the year B.C. 123, a new class, called the _Ordo Equestris_, was\r\nformed in the state by the Lex Sempronia, which was introduced by C.\r\nGracchus. By this law, or one passed a few years afterwards, every\r\nperson who was to be chosen judex was required to be above 30 and\r\nunder 60 years of age, to have either an equus publicus, or to be\r\nqualified by his fortune to possess one, and _not_ to be a senator.\r\nThe number of judices, who were required yearly, was chosen from\r\nthis class by the praetor urbanus. As the name of equites had been\r\noriginally extended from those who possessed the public horses to\r\nthose who served with their own horses, it now came to be applied\r\nto all those persons who were qualified by their fortune to act as\r\njudices, in which sense the word is usually used by Cicero. After\r\nthe reform of Sulla, which entirely deprived the equestrian order\r\nof the right of being chosen as judices, and the passing of the Lex\r\nAurelia (B.C. 70), which ordained that the judices should be chosen\r\nfrom the senators, equites, and tribuni aerarii, the influence of\r\nthe order, says Pliny, was still maintained by the _publicani_,\r\nor farmers of the public taxes. We find that the publicani were\r\nalmost always called equites, not because any particular rank was\r\nnecessary in order to obtain from the state the farming of the\r\ntaxes, but because the state was not accustomed to let them to any\r\none who did not possess a considerable fortune. Thus the publicani\r\nare frequently spoken of by Cicero as identical with the equestrian\r\norder. The consulship of Cicero, and the active part which the\r\nknights then took in suppressing the conspiracy of Catiline, tended\r\nstill further to increase the power and influence of the equestrian\r\norder; and “from that time,” says Pliny, “it became a third body\r\n(_corpus_) in the state, and, to the title of _Senatus Populusque\r\nRomanus_, there began to be added _Et Equestris Ordo_.” In B.C. 63,\r\na distinction was conferred upon them, which tended to separate them\r\nstill further from the plebs. By the Lex Roscia Othonis, passed\r\nin that year, the first fourteen seats in the theatre behind the\r\norchestra were given to the equites. They also possessed the right\r\nof wearing the Clavus Angustus [CLAVUS], and subsequently obtained\r\nthe privilege of wearing a gold ring, which was originally confined\r\nto the equites equo publico. The number of equites increased greatly\r\nunder the early emperors, and all persons were admitted into the\r\norder, provided they possessed the requisite property, without any\r\ninquiry into their character, or into the free birth of their father\r\nand grandfather. The order in consequence gradually began to lose all\r\nthe consideration which it had acquired during the later times of the\r\nrepublic.--Augustus formed a select class of equites, consisting of\r\nthose equites who possessed the property of a senator, and the old\r\nrequirement of free birth up to the grandfather. He permitted this\r\nclass to wear the _latus clavus_; and also allowed the tribunes of\r\nthe plebs to be chosen from them, as well as the senators, and gave\r\nthem the option, at the termination of their office, to remain in the\r\nsenate or return to the equestrian order. This class of knights was\r\ndistinguished by the special title _illustres_ (sometimes _insignes_\r\nand _splendidi_) _equites Romani_. The formation of this distinct\r\nclass tended to lower the others still more in public estimation.\r\nIn the ninth year of the reign of Tiberius, an attempt was made\r\nto improve the order by requiring the old qualifications of free\r\nbirth up to the grandfather, and by strictly forbidding any one to\r\nwear the gold ring unless he possessed this qualification. This\r\nregulation, however, was of little avail, as the emperors frequently\r\nadmitted freedmen into the equestrian order. When private persons\r\nwere no longer appointed judices, the necessity for a distinct class\r\nin the community, like the equestrian order, ceased entirely; and\r\nthe gold ring came at length to be worn by all free citizens. Even\r\nslaves, after their manumission, were allowed to wear it by special\r\npermission from the emperor, which appears to have been usually\r\ngranted provided the patronus consented.--Having thus traced the\r\nhistory of the equestrian order to its final extinction as a distinct\r\nclass in the community, we must now return to the equites equo\r\npublico, who formed the 18 equestrian centuries. This class still\r\nexisted during the latter years of the republic, but had entirely\r\nceased to serve as horse-soldiers in the army. The cavalry of the\r\nRoman legions no longer consisted, as in the time of Polybius, of\r\nRoman equites, but their place was supplied by the cavalry of the\r\nallied states. It is evident that Caesar in his Gallic wars possessed\r\nno Roman cavalry. When he went to an interview with Ariovistus,\r\nand was obliged to take cavalry with him, we are told that he did\r\nnot dare to trust his safety to the Gallic cavalry, and therefore\r\nmounted his legionary soldiers upon their horses. The Roman equites\r\nare, however, frequently mentioned in the Gallic and civil wars,\r\nbut never as common soldiers; they were officers attached to the\r\nstaff of the general, or commanded the cavalry of the allies, or\r\nsometimes the legions.--After the year B.C. 50, there were no censors\r\nin the state, and it would therefore follow that for some years\r\nno review of the body took place, and that the vacancies were not\r\nfilled up. When Augustus, however, took upon himself, in B.C. 29,\r\nthe praefectura morum, he frequently reviewed the troops of equites,\r\nand restored the long neglected custom of the solemn procession\r\n(_transvectio_). From this time these equites formed an honourable\r\ncorps, from which all the higher officers in the army and the chief\r\nmagistrates in the state were chosen. Admission into this body was\r\nequivalent to an introduction into public life, and was therefore\r\nesteemed a great privilege. If a young man was not admitted into\r\nthis body, he was excluded from all civil offices of any importance,\r\nexcept in municipal towns; and also from all rank in the army,\r\nwith the exception of centurion. All those equites, who were not\r\nemployed in actual service, were obliged to reside at Rome, where\r\nthey were allowed to fill the lower magistracies, which entitled\r\na person to admission into the senate. They were divided into six\r\nturmae, each of which was commanded by an officer, who is frequently\r\nmentioned in inscriptions as _Sevir equitum Rom. turmae_ I. II., &c.,\r\nor commonly _Sevir turmae_ or _Sevir turmarum equitum Romanorum_.\r\nFrom the time that the equites bestowed the title of _principes\r\njuventutis_ upon Caius and Lucius Caesar, the grandsons of Augustus,\r\nit became the custom to confer this title, as well as that of sevir,\r\nupon the probable successor to the throne, when he first entered\r\ninto public life, and was presented with an equus publicus. The\r\npractice of filling all the higher offices in the state from these\r\nequites appears to have continued as long as Rome was the centre of\r\nthe government and the residence of the emperor. After the time of\r\nDiocletian, the equites became only a city guard, under the command\r\nof the praefectus vigilum; but they still retained, in the time of\r\nValentinianus and Valens, A.D. 364, the second rank in the city, and\r\nwere not subject to corporal punishment. Respecting the _Magister\r\nEquitum_, see DICTATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔQUŬLĔUS or ĔCŬLĔUS, an instrument of torture, which is supposed to\r\nhave been so called because it was in the form of a horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔRĂNI (ἔρανοι), were clubs or societies, established for charitable,\r\nconvivial, commercial, or political purposes. Unions of this kind\r\nwere called by the general name of ἑταιρίαι, and were often converted\r\nto mischievous ends, such as bribery, overawing the public assembly,\r\nor influencing courts of justice. In the days of the Roman empire\r\nfriendly societies, under the name of _erani_, were frequent among\r\nthe Greek cities, but were looked on with suspicion by the emperors,\r\nas leading to political combinations. The _gilds_, or fraternities\r\nfor mutual aid, among the ancient Saxons, resembled the _erani_ of\r\nthe Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nERGASTŬLUM, a private prison attached to most Roman farms, where\r\nthe slaves were made to work in chains. The slaves confined in an\r\nergastulum were also employed to cultivate the fields in chains.\r\nSlaves who had displeased their masters were punished by imprisonment\r\nin the ergastulum; and in the same place all slaves, who could not be\r\ndepended upon or were barbarous in their habits, were regularly kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nĒRĪCĬUS, a military engine full of sharp spikes, which was placed by\r\nthe gate of the camp to prevent the approach of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nĔRŌTĬA or ĔRŌTĬDĬA (ἐρώτια or ἐρωτίδια), the most solemn of all the\r\nfestivals celebrated in the Boeotian town of Thespiae. It took place\r\nevery fifth year, and in honour of Eros, the principal divinity of\r\nthe Thespians. Respecting the particulars nothing is known, except\r\nthat it was solemnised with contests in music and gymnastics.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSĔDĀRĬI. [ESSEDUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nESSĔDA, or ESSĔDUM (from the Celtic _Ess_, a carriage), the name of\r\na chariot used, especially in war, by the Britons, the Gauls, and\r\nthe Germans. It was built very strongly, was open before instead of\r\nbehind, like the Greek war-chariot, and had a wide pole, so that the\r\nowner was able, whenever he pleased, to run along the pole, and even\r\nto raise himself upon the yoke, and then to retreat with the greatest\r\nspeed into the body of the car, which he drove with extraordinary\r\nswiftness and skill. It appears also that these cars were purposely\r\nmade as noisy as possible, probably by the creaking and clanging of\r\nthe wheels; and that this was done in order to strike dismay into the\r\nenemy. The warriors who drove these chariots were called _essedarii_.\r\nHaving been captured, they were sometimes exhibited in the\r\ngladiatorial shows at Rome, and seem to have been great favourites\r\nwith the people. The essedum was adopted for purposes of convenience\r\nand luxury among the Romans. As used by the Romans, the essedum may\r\nhave differed from the cisium in this; that the cisium was drawn by\r\none horse (see cut, p. 90), the essedum always by a pair.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUMOLPĬDAE (εὐμολπίδαι), the most distinguished and venerable among\r\nthe priestly families in Attica. They were devoted to the service of\r\nDemeter at Athens and Eleusis, and were said to be the descendants\r\nof the Thracian bard Eumolpus, who, according to some legends, had\r\nintroduced the Eleusinian mysteries into Attica. The high priest of\r\nthe Eleusinian goddess (ἱεροφάντης or μυσταγωγός), who conducted the\r\ncelebration of her mysteries and the initiation of the mystae, was\r\nalways a member of the family of the Eumolpidae, as Eumolpus himself\r\nwas believed to have been the first hierophant. The hierophant was\r\nattended by four _epimeletae_ (ἐπιμεληταί), one of whom likewise\r\nbelonged to the family of the Eumolpidae. The Eumolpidae had on\r\ncertain occasions to offer up prayers for the welfare of the state.\r\nThey had likewise judicial power in cases where religion was\r\nviolated. The law according to which they pronounced their sentence,\r\nand of which they had the exclusive possession, was not written,\r\nbut handed down by tradition; and the Eumolpidae alone had the\r\nright to interpret it, whence they are sometimes called _Exegetae_\r\n(ἐξηγηταί). In cases for which the law had made no provisions, they\r\nacted according to their own discretion. In some cases, when a person\r\nwas convicted of gross violation of the public institutions of his\r\ncountry, the people, besides sending the offender into exile, added a\r\nclause in their verdict that a curse should be pronounced upon him by\r\nthe Eumolpidae. But the Eumolpidae could pronounce such a curse only\r\nat the command of the people, and might afterwards be compelled by\r\nthe people to revoke it, and purify the person whom they had cursed\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUPATRĬDAE (εὐπατρίδαι), descended from noble ancestors, is the name\r\nby which in early times the nobility of Attica was designated. In\r\nthe division of the inhabitants of Attica into three classes, which\r\nis ascribed to Theseus, the Eupatridae were the first class, and\r\nthus formed a compact order of nobles, united by their interests,\r\nrights, and privileges. They were in the exclusive possession of all\r\nthe civil and religious offices in the state, ordered the affairs of\r\nreligion, and interpreted the laws human and divine. The king was\r\nthus only the first among his equals, and only distinguished from\r\nthem by the duration of his office. By the legislation of Solon,\r\nthe political power and influence of the Eupatridae as an order\r\nwas broken, and property instead of birth was made the standard\r\nof political rights. But as Solon, like all ancient legislators,\r\nabstained from abolishing any of the religious institutions, those\r\nfamilies of the Eupatridae, in which certain priestly offices and\r\nfunctions were hereditary, retained these distinctions down to a very\r\nlate period of Grecian history.\r\n\r\n\r\nEURĪPUS. [AMPHITHEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEUTHȲNĒ (εὐθύνη). All public officers at Athens were accountable for\r\ntheir conduct and the manner in which they acquitted themselves of\r\ntheir official duties. The judges in the popular court seem to have\r\nbeen the only authorities who were not responsible, for they were\r\nthemselves the representatives of the people, and would therefore,\r\nin theory, have been responsible to themselves. This account, which\r\nofficers had to give after the time of their office was over, was\r\ncalled εὐθύνη, and the officers subject to it, ὑπεύθυνοι, and after\r\nthey had gone through the _euthyne_, they became ἀνεύθυνοι. Every\r\npublic officer had to render his account within thirty days after the\r\nexpiration of his office, and at the time when he submitted to the\r\n_euthyne_ any citizen had the right to come forward and impeach him.\r\nThe officers before whom the accounts were given were at Athens ten\r\nin number, called εὔθυνοι or λογισταί, in other places ἐξετασταί or\r\nσυνήγοροι.\r\n\r\n\r\nĒVŎCĀTI. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAUCTŌRĬTAS. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAUGŬRĀTĬO, the act of changing a sacred thing into a profane one,\r\nor of taking away from it the sacred character which it had received\r\nby inauguratio, consecratio, or dedicatio. Such an act was performed\r\nby the augurs, and never without consulting the pleasure of the gods,\r\nby augurium.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCŬBĬAE. [CASTRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCŬBĬTŌRES, which properly means watchmen or sentinels of any kind,\r\nwas the name more particularly given to the soldiers of the cohort\r\nwho guarded the palace of the Roman emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXEDRA (ἐξέδρα), which properly signifies a seat out of doors, came\r\nto be used for a chamber furnished with seats, and opening into a\r\nportico, where people met to enjoy conversation; such as the rooms\r\nattached to a gymnasium, which were used for the lectures and\r\ndisputations of the rhetoricians and philosophers. In old Greek the\r\nword λέσχη appears to have had a similar meaning; but the ordinary\r\nuse of the word is for a larger and more public place of resort than\r\nthe ἐξέδρα. [LESCHE.] Among the Romans the word had a wider meaning,\r\nanswering to both the Greek terms, ἐξέδρα and λέσχη.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXĒGĒTAE (ἐξηγηταί, interpreters) is the name of the Eumolpidae, by\r\nwhich they were designated as the interpreters of the laws relating\r\nto religion and of the sacred rites. [EUMOLPIDAE.] The name ἐξηγητής\r\nwas also applied to those persons who served as guides (ciceroni) to\r\nthe visitors in the most remarkable towns and places of Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCĬTŌRĬA ACTĬO, an action granted by the edict against the\r\nexercitor navis. By the term navis was understood any vessel, whether\r\nused for the navigation of rivers, lakes, or the sea. The exercitor\r\nnavis is the person to whom all the ship’s gains and earnings\r\n(_obventiones et reditus_) belong, whether he is the owner, or has\r\nhired the ship (_per aversionem_) from the owner for a time definite\r\nor indefinite.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCĬTUS (στρατός), army. (1) GREEK.\r\n\r\n1. _Spartan Army._--In all the states of Greece, in the earliest as\r\nin later times, the general type of their military organisation was\r\nthe _phalanx_, a body of troops in close array with a long spear as\r\ntheir principal weapon. It was among the Dorians, and especially\r\namong the Spartans, that this type was most rigidly adhered to.\r\nThe strength of their military array consisted in the heavy-armed\r\ninfantry (ὁπλίται). They attached comparatively small importance to\r\ntheir cavalry, which was always inferior. Indeed, the Thessalians and\r\nBoeotians were the only Greek people who distinguished themselves\r\nmuch for their cavalry; scarcely any other states had territories\r\nadapted for the evolutions of cavalry. The whole life of a Spartan\r\nwas little else than either the preparation for or the practice of\r\nwar. The result was, that in the strictness of their discipline,\r\nthe precision and facility with which they performed their military\r\nevolutions, and the skill and power with which they used their\r\nweapons, the Spartans were unrivalled among the Greeks. The\r\nheavy-armed infantry of the Spartan armies was composed partly of\r\ngenuine Spartan citizens, partly of Perioeci. Every Spartan citizen\r\nwas liable to military service (ἔμφρουρος) from the age of twenty\r\nto the age of sixty years. They were divided into six divisions\r\ncalled μόραι, under the command or superintendence of a polemarch,\r\neach mora being subdivided into four λόχοι(commanded by λοχαγοί),\r\neach λόχος into two πεντηκοστύες (headed by πεντηκοστῆρες), each\r\nπεντηκοστύς into two ἐνωμοτίαι (headed by enomotarchs). The ἐνωμοτίαι\r\nwere so called from the men composing them being bound together by\r\na common oath. These were not merely divisions of troops engaged in\r\nactual military expeditions. The whole body of citizens at all times\r\nformed an army, whether they were congregated at head-quarters in\r\nSparta, or a portion of them were detached on foreign service. The\r\nstrength of a mora on actual service, of course, varied, according to\r\ncircumstances. To judge by the name pentecostys, the normal number\r\nof a mora would have been 400; but 500, 600, and 900 are mentioned\r\nas the number of men in a mora on different occasions. When in the\r\nfield, each mora of infantry was attended by a mora of cavalry,\r\nconsisting at the most of 100 men, and commanded by an hipparmost\r\n(ἱππαρμοστής). Plutarch mentions squadrons (οὐλαμοί) of fifty, which\r\nmay possibly be the same divisions. The cavalry seems merely to\r\nhave been employed to protect the flanks, and but little regard was\r\npaid to it. The corps of 300 ἱππεῖς formed a sort of body-guard for\r\nthe king, and consisted of the flower of the young soldiers. Though\r\ncalled horsemen, they fought on foot. A Spartan army, divided as\r\nabove described, was drawn up in the dense array of the phalanx, the\r\ndepth of which depended upon circumstances. An ἐνωμοτία sometimes\r\nmade but a single file, sometimes was drawn up in three or six files\r\n(ζύγα). The enomotarch stood at the head of his file (πρωτοστάτης),\r\nor at the head of the right-hand file, if the enomotia was broken up\r\ninto more than one. The last man was called οὐραγός. It was a matter\r\nof great importance that he, like the enomotarch, should be a man of\r\nstrength and skill, as in certain evolutions he would have to lead\r\nthe movements. The commander-in-chief, who was usually the king,\r\nhad his station sometimes in the centre, more commonly on the right\r\nwing. The commands of the general were issued in the first place\r\nto the polemarchs, by these to the lochagi, by these again to the\r\npentecosteres, by the latter to the enomotarchs, and by these last to\r\ntheir respective divisions. From the orderly manner in which this was\r\ndone, commands were transmitted with great rapidity: every soldier,\r\nin fact, regulating the movements of the man behind him, every two\r\nbeing connected together as πρωτοστάτης and ἐπιστάτης. In later times\r\nthe king was usually accompanied by two ephors, as controllers and\r\nadvisers. These, with the polemarchs, the four Pythii, three peers\r\n(ὅμοιοι), who had to provide for the necessities of the king in war,\r\nthe laphyropolae and some other officers, constituted what was called\r\nthe _damosia_ of the king. The Spartan hoplites were accompanied in\r\nthe field by helots, partly in the capacity of attendants, partly\r\nto serve as light-armed troops. The number attached to an army was\r\nprobably not uniform. At Plataeae each Spartan was accompanied by\r\nseven helots; but that was probably an extraordinary case. One helot\r\nin particular of those attached to each Spartan was called his\r\nθεράπων, and performed the functions of an armourer or shieldbearer.\r\nXenophon calls them ὑπασπισταί. In extraordinary cases, helots\r\nserved as hoplites, and in that case it was usual to give them their\r\nliberty. A separate troop in the Lacedaemonian army was formed by\r\nthe Sciritae (Σκιρῖται), originally, no doubt, inhabitants of the\r\ndistrict Sciritis. The arms of the phalanx consisted of the long\r\nspear and a short sword (ξυήλη). The chief part of the defensive\r\narmour was the large brazen shield, which covered the body from the\r\nshoulder to the knee, suspended, as in ancient times, by a thong\r\nround the neck, and managed by a simple handle or ring (πόρπαξ).\r\nBesides this, they had the ordinary armour of the hoplite [ARMA]. The\r\nheavy-armed soldiers wore a scarlet uniform. The Spartan encampments\r\nwere circular. Only the heavy-armed were stationed within them, the\r\ncavalry being placed to look out, and the helots being kept as much\r\nas possible outside. Preparatory to a battle the Spartan soldier\r\ndressed his hair and crowned himself as others would do for a feast.\r\nThe signal for attack was given not by the trumpet, but by the music\r\nof flutes, and sometimes also of the lyre and cithara, to which the\r\nmen sang the battle song (παιὰν ἐμβατήριος). The object of the music\r\nwas not so much to inspirit the men, as simply to regulate the march\r\nof the phalanx. This rhythmical regularity of movement was a point to\r\nwhich the Spartans attached great importance.\r\n\r\n2. _Athenian Army._--In Athens, the military system was in its\r\nleading principles the same as among the Spartans, though differing\r\nin detail, and carried out with less exactness; inasmuch as when\r\nAthens became powerful, greater attention was paid to the navy.\r\nOf the four classes into which the citizens were arranged by the\r\nconstitution of Solon, the citizens of the first and second served\r\nas cavalry, or as commanders of the infantry (still it need not be\r\nassumed that the ἱππεῖς never served as heavy-armed infantry), those\r\nof the third class (ζευγῖται) formed the heavy-armed infantry. The\r\nThetes served either as light-armed troops on land, or on board the\r\nships. The same general principles remained when the constitution\r\nwas remodelled by Cleisthenes. The cavalry service continued to\r\nbe compulsory on the wealthier class. Every citizen was liable to\r\nservice from his eighteenth to his sixtieth year. On reaching their\r\neighteenth year, the young citizens were formally enrolled εἰς\r\nτὴν ληξιαρχικὸν γραμματεῖον, and received a shield and spear in a\r\npublic assembly of the people, binding themselves by oath to perform\r\nrightly the duties of a citizen and a soldier. During the first two\r\nyears, they were only liable to service in Attica itself, chiefly\r\nas garrison soldiers in the different fortresses in the country.\r\nDuring this period, they were called περίπολοι. Members of the senate\r\nduring the period of their office, farmers of the revenue, choreutae\r\nat the Dionysia during the festival, in later times, traders by sea\r\nalso, were exempted from military service. Any one bound to serve who\r\nattempted to avoid doing so, was liable to a sentence of ἀτιμία. The\r\nresident aliens commonly served as heavy-armed soldiers, especially\r\nfor the purpose of garrisoning the city. They were prohibited\r\nfrom serving as cavalry. Slaves were only employed as soldiers in\r\ncases of great necessity. Of the details of the Athenian military\r\norganisation, we have no distinct accounts as we have of those of\r\nSparta. The heavy-armed troops, as was the universal practice in\r\nGreece, fought in phalanx order. They were arranged in bodies in a\r\nmanner dependent on the political divisions of the citizens. The\r\nsoldiers of each tribe (φυλή) formed a separate body in the army,\r\nalso called a tribe, and these bodies stood in some preconcerted\r\norder. It seems that the name of one division was τάξις, and of\r\nanother λόχος, but in what relations these stood to the φυλή, and\r\nto each other, we do not learn. Every hoplite was accompanied by\r\nan attendant (ὑπηρέτης) to take charge of his baggage, and carry\r\nhis shield on a march. Each horseman also had a servant, called\r\nἱπποκόμος, to attend to his horse. For the command of the army, there\r\nwere chosen every year ten generals [STRATEGI], and ten taxiarchs\r\n[TAXIARCHI], and for the cavalry, two hipparchs (ἵππαρχοι) and ten\r\nphylarchs (φύλαρχοι). Respecting the military functions of the ἄρχων\r\nπολέμαρχος, see the article Archon. The number of strategi sent with\r\nan army was not uniform. Three was a common number. Sometimes one was\r\ninvested with the supreme command; at other times, they either took\r\nthe command in turn (as at Marathon), or conducted their operations\r\nby common consent (as in the Sicilian expedition). The practice of\r\npaying the troops when upon service was first introduced by Pericles.\r\nThe pay consisted partly of wages (μισθός), partly of provisions,\r\nor, more commonly, provision-money (σιτηρέσιον). The ordinary μισθός\r\nof a hoplite was two obols a day. The σιτηρέσιον amounted to two\r\nobols more. Hence, the life of a soldier was called, proverbially,\r\nτετρωβόλου βίος. Officers received twice as much; horsemen, three\r\ntimes; generals, four times as much. The horsemen received pay even\r\nin time of peace, that they might always be in readiness, and also a\r\nsum of money for their outfit (κατάστασις). As regards the military\r\nstrength of the Athenians, we find 10,000 heavy-armed soldiers at\r\nMarathon, 8,000 heavy-armed, and as many light-armed at Plataeae;\r\nand at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war there were 18,000\r\nheavy-armed ready for foreign service, and 16,000 consisting of those\r\nbeyond the limits of the ordinary military age and of the metoeci,\r\nfor garrison service. It was the natural result of the national\r\ncharacter of the Athenians and their democratical constitution,\r\nthat military discipline was much less stringent among them than\r\namong the Spartans, and after defeat especially it was often found\r\nextremely difficult to maintain it. The generals had some power of\r\npunishing military offences on the spot, but for the greater number\r\nof such offences a species of court-martial was held, consisting of\r\npersons who had served in the army to which the offender belonged,\r\nand presided over by the strategi. Various rewards also were held\r\nout for those who especially distinguished themselves for their\r\ncourage or conduct, in the shape of chaplets, statues, &c. The\r\nPeltastae (πελτασταί), so called from the kind of shield which they\r\nwore [PELTA], were a class of troops of which we hear very little\r\nbefore the end of the Peloponnesian war. The Athenian general\r\nIphicrates introduced some important improvements in the mode of\r\narming them, combining as far as possible the peculiar advantages\r\nof heavy (ὁπλῖται) and light armed (ψιλοί) troops. He substituted a\r\nlinen corslet for the coat of mail worn by the hoplites, and lessened\r\nthe shield, while he doubled the length of the spear and sword. He\r\neven took the pains to introduce for them an improved sort of shoe,\r\ncalled after him Ἰφικρατίδες. This equipment proved very effective.\r\nThe almost total destruction of a mora of Lacedaemonian heavy-armed\r\ntroops by a body of peltastae under the command of Iphicrates was an\r\nexploit that became very famous. When the use of mercenary troops\r\nbecame general, Athenian citizens seldom served except as volunteers,\r\nand then in but small numbers. The employment of mercenaries led\r\nto considerable alterations in the military system of Greece. War\r\ncame to be studied as an art, and Greek generals, rising above the\r\nold simple rules of warfare, became tacticians. Epaminondas was the\r\nfirst who adopted the method of charging in column, concentrating his\r\nattack upon one point of the hostile line, so as to throw the whole\r\ninto confusion by breaking through it.\r\n\r\n3. MACEDONIAN ARMY.--Philip, king of Macedonia, made several\r\nimprovements in the arms and arrangement of the phalanx. The spear\r\n(σάρισσα or σάρισα), with which the soldiers of the Macedonian\r\nphalanx were armed, was 24 feet long; but the ordinary length was 21\r\nfeet, and the lines were arranged at such distances that the spears\r\nof the fifth rank projected three feet beyond the first, so that\r\nevery man in the front rank was protected by five spears. Besides\r\nthe spear they carried a short sword. The shield was very large\r\nand covered nearly the whole body, so that on favourable ground an\r\nimpenetrable front was presented to the enemy. The soldiers were\r\nalso defended by helmets, coats of mail, and greaves; so that any\r\nthing like rapid movement was impossible. The ordinary depth of the\r\nphalanx was sixteen files, though depths of eight and of thirty-two\r\nare also mentioned. Each file of sixteen was called λόχος. Two lochi\r\nmade a _dilochia_; two dilochiae made a τετραρχία, consisting of\r\nsixty-four men; two tetrarchies made a τάξις; two τάξεις a σύνταγμα\r\nor ξεναγία, to which were attached five supernumeraries, a herald,\r\nan ensign, a trumpeter, a servant, and an officer to bring up\r\nthe rear (οὐραγός); two syntagmata formed a pentacosiarchia, two\r\nof which made a χιλιαρχία, containing 1024 men; two chiliarchies\r\nmade a τέλος, and two τέλη made a phalangarchia or phalanx in\r\nthe narrower sense of the word, the normal number of which would\r\ntherefore be 4096. It was commanded by a polemarch or strategus; four\r\nsuch bodies formed the larger phalanx, the normal number of which\r\nwould be 16,384. When drawn up, the two middle sections constituted\r\nwhat was termed the ὀμφαλός, the others being called κέρατα or\r\nwings. The phalanx soldiers in the army of Alexander amounted to\r\n18,000, and were divided not into four, but into six divisions,\r\neach named after a Macedonian province, from which it was to derive\r\nits recruits. These bodies are oftener called τάξεις than φάλαγγες\r\nby the historians, and their leaders taxiarchs or strategi. The\r\nphalanx of Antiochus consisted of 16,000 men, and was formed into\r\nten divisions (μέρη) of 1600 each, arranged 50 broad and 32 deep.\r\nThe phalanx, of course, became all but useless, if its ranks were\r\nbroken. It required, therefore, level and open ground, so that its\r\noperations were restricted to very narrow limits; and being incapable\r\nof rapid movement, it became almost helpless in the face of an\r\nactive enemy, unless accompanied by a sufficient number of cavalry\r\nand light troops. The light-armed troops were arranged in files\r\n(λόχοι) eight deep. Four lochi formed a σύστασις, and then larger\r\ndivisions were successively formed, each being the double of the one\r\nbelow it; the largest (called ἐπίταγμα), consisting of 8192 men.\r\nThe cavalry (according to Aelianus), were arranged in an analogous\r\nmanner, the lowest division or squadron (ἴλη), containing 64 men,\r\nand the successive larger divisions being each the double of that\r\nbelow it; the highest (ἐπίταγμα) containing 4096. Both Philip and\r\nAlexander attached great importance to the cavalry, which, in their\r\narmies, consisted partly of Macedonians, and partly of Thessalians.\r\nThe Macedonian horsemen were the flower of the young nobles. They\r\namounted to about 1200 in number, forming eight squadrons, and, under\r\nthe name ἕταιροι, formed a sort of body-guard for the king. The\r\nThessalian cavalry consisted chiefly of the elite of the wealthier\r\nclass of the Thessalians, but included also a number of Grecian\r\nyouth from other states. There was also a guard of foot soldiers\r\n(ὑπασπισταί), whom we find greatly distinguishing themselves in\r\nthe campaigns of Alexander. They seem to be identical with the\r\nπεζέταιροι, of whom we find mention. They amounted to about 3000\r\nmen, arranged in six battalions (τάξεις). There was also a troop\r\ncalled Argyraspids, from the silver with which their shields were\r\nornamented. They seem to have been a species of peltastae. Alexander\r\nalso organised a kind of troops called διμάχαι, who were something\r\nintermediate between cavalry and infantry, being designed to fight on\r\nhorseback or on foot, as circumstances required. It is in the time of\r\nAlexander the Great, that we first meet with artillery in the train\r\nof a Grecian army. His _balistae_ and _catapeltae_ were frequently\r\nemployed with great effect, as, for instance, at the passage of the\r\nJaxartes.\r\n\r\n(2) ROMAN. _General Remarks on the Legion._--The name _Legio_ is\r\ncoeval with the foundation of Rome, and denoted a body of troops,\r\nwhich, although subdivided into several smaller bodies, was regarded\r\nas forming an organised whole. It was not equivalent to what we\r\ncall a _regiment_, inasmuch as it contained troops of all arms,\r\ninfantry, cavalry, and, when military engines were extensively\r\nemployed, artillery also; it might thus, so far, be regarded as a\r\ncomplete _army_, but on the other hand the number of soldiers in a\r\nlegion was fixed within certain limits, never much exceeding 6000,\r\nand hence when war was carried on upon a large scale, a single army,\r\nunder the command of one general, frequently contained two, three,\r\nor more legions, besides a large number of auxiliaries of various\r\ndenominations. The legion for many centuries was composed exclusively\r\nof Roman citizens. By the ordinances of Servius Tullius those alone\r\nwho were enrolled in the five classes were eligible, and one of the\r\ngreatest changes introduced by Marius (B.C. 107) was the admission of\r\nall orders of citizens, including the lowest, into the ranks. Up to\r\nthe year B.C. 107, no one was permitted to serve among the regular\r\ntroops of the state, except those who were regarded as possessing a\r\nstrong personal interest in the stability of the commonwealth; but\r\nthe principle having been at this period abandoned, the privilege\r\nwas extended after the close of the Social War (B.C. 87) to nearly\r\nthe whole of the free population of Italy, and by the famous edict\r\nof Caracalla (or perhaps of M. Aurelius), to the whole Roman world.\r\nLong before this, however, the legions were raised chiefly in the\r\nprovinces; but it does not appear that the admission of foreigners\r\nnot subjects was ever practised upon a large scale until the reign\r\nof the second Claudius (A.D. 268-270), who incorporated a large body\r\nof vanquished Goths, and of Probus (A.D. 276-282), who distributed\r\n16,000 Germans among legionary and frontier battalions. From this\r\ntime forward what had originally been the leading characteristic\r\nof the legion was rapidly obliterated, so that under Diocletian,\r\nConstantine, and their successors, the best soldiers in the Roman\r\narmies were barbarians. The practice of granting pensions for long\r\nservice in the shape of donations of land was first introduced upon\r\na large scale after the Mithridatic wars. Hence, when Augustus, in\r\ncompliance with the advice of Maecenas, determined to provide for\r\nthe security of the distant provinces, and for tranquil submission\r\nat home by the establishment of a powerful standing army, he found\r\nthe public mind in a great degree prepared for such a measure, and\r\nthe distinction between soldier and civilian unknown, or at least not\r\nrecognised before, became from this time forward as broadly marked\r\nas in the most pure military despotisms of ancient or modern times.\r\nThe legions were originally numbered according to the order in which\r\nthey were raised. As they became permanent, the same numbers remained\r\nattached to the same corps, which were moreover distinguished by\r\nvarious epithets of which we have early examples in the _Legio\r\nMartia_, and the _Legio Quinta Alauda_. [ALAUDA.] Several legions\r\nbore the same number: thus there were four _Firsts_, five _Seconds_,\r\nand five _Thirds_. The total number of legions under Augustus was\r\ntwenty-five, under Alexander Severus thirty-two, but during the\r\ncivil wars the number was far greater.--The number of soldiers who,\r\nat different periods, were contained in a legion, does not appear\r\nto have been absolutely fixed, but to have varied within moderate\r\nlimits. Under Romulus the legion contained 3000 foot soldiers. It\r\nis highly probable that some change may have been introduced by\r\nServius Tullius, but, in so far as numbers are concerned, we have no\r\nevidence. From the expulsion of the Kings until the second year of\r\nthe second Punic War, the regular number may be fixed at 4000 or 4200\r\ninfantry. From the latter period until the consulship of Marius the\r\nordinary number may be fixed at from 5000 to 5200. For some centuries\r\nafter Marius the numbers varied from 5000 to 6200, generally\r\napproaching to the higher limit. Amid all the variations with regard\r\nto the infantry, 300 horsemen formed the regular complement (_justus\r\nequitatus_) of the legion. When troops were raised for a service\r\nwhich required special arrangements, the number of horsemen was\r\nsometimes increased beyond 300. It must be observed, however, that\r\nthese remarks with regard to the cavalry apply only to the period\r\nbefore Marius. We now proceed to consider the organisation of the\r\nlegion at five different periods.\r\n\r\n_First Period. Servius Tullius._ The legion of Servius is so closely\r\nconnected with the Comitia Centuriata that it has already been\r\ndiscussed in a former article [COMITIA], and it is only necessary to\r\nrepeat here that it was a phalanx equipped in the Greek fashion, the\r\nfront ranks being furnished with a complete suit of armour, their\r\nweapons being long spears, and their chief defence the round Argolic\r\nshield (_clipeus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  15 Manipuli of Hastati.\r\n  15 Manipuli of Principes.\r\n  Triarii proper     } 15 triple\r\n  Rorarii            } Manipuli of\r\n  Accensi            } Triarii.]\r\n\r\n_Second Period. The Great Latin War_, B.C. 340. Our authority for\r\nthis period is Livy (viii. 8). The legion in B.C. 340 had almost\r\nentirely discarded the tactics of the phalanx. It was now drawn up in\r\nthree, or perhaps we ought to say, in five lines. The soldiers of the\r\nfirst line, called _Hastati_, consisted of youths in the first bloom\r\nof manhood distributed into 15 companies or maniples (_manipuli_),\r\na moderate space being left between each. The maniple contained\r\n60 privates, 2 centurions (_centuriones_), and a standard bearer\r\n(_vexillarius_); two-thirds were heavily armed and bore the _scutum_\r\nor large oblong shield, the remainder carried only a spear (_hasta_)\r\nand light javelins (_gaesa_), The second line, the _Principes_,\r\nwas composed of men in the full vigour of life, divided in like\r\nmanner into 15 maniples, all heavily armed (_scutati omnes_). The\r\ntwo lines of the _Hastati_ and _Principes_ taken together amounted\r\nto 30 maniples, and formed the _Antepilani_. The third line, the\r\n_Triarii_, composed of tried veterans, was also in 15 divisions, but\r\neach of these was triple, containing 3 manipuli, 180 privates, 6\r\ncenturions, and 3 vexillarii. In these triple manipuli the veterans\r\nor _triarii_ proper formed the front ranks; immediately behind them\r\nstood the _Rorarii_, inferior in age and prowess, while the _Accensi_\r\nor supernumeraries, less trustworthy than either, were posted in the\r\nextreme rear. The battle array may be thus represented. The fight was\r\ncommenced by the _Rorarii_, so called because the light missiles\r\nwhich they sprinkled among the foe were like the drops which are the\r\nforerunners of the thunder shower, who, running forwards between the\r\nranks of the antepilani, acted as tirailleurs; when they were driven\r\nin they returned to their station behind the triarii, and the battle\r\nbegan in earnest by the onset of the hastati; if they were unable to\r\nmake any impression they retired between the ranks of the principes,\r\nwho now advanced and bore the brunt of the combat, supported by the\r\nhastati, who had rallied in their rear. If the principes also failed\r\nto make an impression, they retired through the openings between the\r\nmaniples of the triarii, who up to this time had been crouched on\r\nthe ground (hence called _subsidiarii_), but now arose to make the\r\nlast effort (whence the phrase _rem ad triarios redisse_). No longer\r\nretaining the open order of the two first lines, they closed up their\r\nranks so as to present an unbroken line of heavy-armed veterans in\r\nfront, while the rorarii and accensi, pressing up from behind, gave\r\nweight and consistency to the mass,--an arrangement bearing evidence\r\nto a lingering predilection for the principle of the phalanx, and\r\nexhibiting, just as we might expect at that period, the Roman tactics\r\nin their transition state. It must be observed that the words\r\n_ordo_, _manipulus_, _vexillum_, although generally kept distinct,\r\nare throughout the chapter used as synonymous. Livy concludes by\r\nsaying, that four legions were commonly levied, each consisting of\r\n5000 infantry and 300 horse. We must suppose that he speaks in round\r\nnumbers in so far as the infantry are concerned, for according to his\r\nown calculations the numbers will stand thus:--\r\n\r\n  Hastati            15 × 60        =   900\r\n  Principes          15 × 60        =   900\r\n  Triarii, &c.       15 × 3 × 60    =  2700\r\n  Centuriones                       =   150\r\n  Vexillarii                        =    75\r\n                                       ----                                     4725\r\n                                       4725\r\n\r\n_Third Period. During the wars of the younger Scipio._ Polybius\r\ndescribes minutely the method pursued in raising the four legions\r\nduring this period. Under ordinary circumstances they were levied\r\nyearly, two being assigned to each consul. It must be observed that\r\na regular consular army (_justus consularis exercitus_) no longer\r\nconsisted of Roman legions only, but as Italy became gradually\r\nsubjugated, the various states under the dominion of Rome were\r\nbound to furnish a contingent, and the number of allies (_socii_)\r\nusually exceeded that of citizens. They were, however, kept perfectly\r\ndistinct, both in the camp and in the battle field. After the\r\nelection of consuls was concluded, the first step was to choose\r\nthe 24 chief officers of the legions, named _tribuni militum_. The\r\nconsuls then summoned to the Capitol all citizens eligible for\r\nmilitary service. They first divided the 24 tribunes into 4 parties\r\nof 6, and the tribes were next summoned in succession by lot. The\r\ntribe whose lot came out first being called up, they picked out from\r\nit four youths, as nearly matched as possible in age and form; out of\r\nthese four, the tribunes of the first legion chose one, the tribunes\r\nof the second legion one of the remaining three; the tribunes of the\r\nthird legion, one of the remaining two, and the last fell to the\r\nfourth legion. Upon the next tribe being called up, the first choice\r\nwas given to the tribunes of the second legion, the second choice to\r\nthose of the third, and the last man fell to the first legion. On\r\nthe next tribe being called up, the tribunes of the third legion had\r\nthe first choice, and so on in succession, the object in view being\r\nthat the four legions should be as nearly alike as possible, not in\r\nthe number only, but in the quality of the soldiers. This process\r\nwas continued until the ranks were complete. In ancient times, the\r\ncavalry were not chosen until after the infantry levy was concluded,\r\nbut when Polybius wrote, the cavalry were picked in the first place\r\nfrom the list on which they were enrolled by the censor according\r\nto their fortune, and 300 were apportioned to each legion. The levy\r\nbeing completed, the tribunes collected the men belonging to their\r\nrespective legions, and making one individual stand out from the rest\r\nadministered to him an oath “that he would obey orders and execute to\r\nthe best of his ability the command of his officers.” (_Sacramento\r\nmilites adigere s. rogare, sacramentum s. sacramento dicere._) The\r\nrest of the soldiers then came forward one by one, and swore to do\r\nwhat the first had bound himself to perform. At the same time the\r\nconsuls gave notice to the magistrates of those towns in Italy in\r\nalliance with Rome, from whom they desired to receive a contingent,\r\nof the number which each would be required to furnish, and of the\r\nday and place of gathering. The allied cities levied their troops\r\nand administered the oath much in the same manner as the Romans, and\r\nthen sent them forth after appointing a commander and a paymaster.\r\nThe soldiers having again assembled, the men belonging to each legion\r\nwere separated into four divisions. 1. 1000 of the youngest and\r\npoorest were set apart to form the _Velites_, the light-armed troops,\r\nor skirmishers of the legion. 2. 1200 who came next in age (or who\r\nwere of the same age with the preceding but more wealthy), formed\r\nthe _Hastati_. 3. 1200, consisting of those in the full vigour of\r\nmanhood, formed the _Principes_. 4. 600, consisting of the oldest and\r\nmost experienced, formed the _Triarii_. When the number of soldiers\r\nin the legion exceeded 4000, the first three divisions were increased\r\nproportionally, but the number of the Triarii remained always the\r\nsame. The Hastati, Principes, and Triarii were each divided into\r\nten companies, called _Manipuli_. The Velites were not divided into\r\ncompanies, but were distributed equally among the Hastati, Principes,\r\nand Triarii. Before the division of the three classes into maniples,\r\nofficers were appointed inferior to the tribunes. 30 men were chosen\r\nby merit, 10 from the Hastati, 10 from the Principes, and 10 from\r\nthe Triarii; and this first choice being completed, 30 more in like\r\nmanner. These 60 officers, of whom 20 were assigned to each of the\r\nthree classes, and distributed equally among the maniples, were named\r\n_centuriones_, or _ordinum ductores_, and each of the 60 chose for\r\nhimself a Lieutenant (_optio_), who, being posted in the rear of the\r\ncompany while the centurion was at the head, was named οὐραγός (i.e.\r\n_Tergiductor_) by the Greeks, so that in each maniple there were two\r\ncenturions and two optiones. Further, the centurions selected out of\r\neach maniple two of the bravest and most vigorous men as standard\r\nbearers (_vexillarii, signiferi_). The first elected centurion of the\r\nwhole had a seat in the military council, and in each maniple the\r\nfirst chosen commanded the right division of the maniple, and the\r\nother the left. Each of these subdivisions of the maniple was called\r\n_centuria_. The cavalry were divided into 10 troops (_turmae_), and\r\nout of each of these 3 officers were chosen, named _decuriones_,\r\nwho named 3 lieutenants (_optiones_). In each troop the decurio\r\nfirst chosen commanded the whole troop, and failing him, the second.\r\nThe infantry furnished by the _socii_ was for the most part equal\r\nin number to the Roman legions, the cavalry twice or thrice as\r\nnumerous, and the whole were divided equally between the two consular\r\narmies. Each consul named twelve superior officers, who were termed\r\n_Praefecti Sociorum_, and corresponded to the legionary tribunes. A\r\nselection was then made of the best men, to the extent of one-fifth\r\nof the infantry and one-third of the cavalry; these were formed into\r\na separate corps under the name of _extraordinarii_, and on the\r\nmarch and in the camp were always near the person of the consul.\r\nThe remainder were divided into two equal portions, and were styled\r\nrespectively the _Dextera Ala_ and the _Sinistra Ala_ [ALA].--_Agmen_\r\nor _Line of March_. The Extraordinarii Pedites led the van followed\r\nby the right wing of the infantry of the allies and the baggage of\r\nthese two divisions; next came one of the Roman legions with its\r\nbaggage following; next the other Roman legion with its own baggage,\r\nand that of the left wing of the allies, who brought up the rear. The\r\ndifferent corps of cavalry sometimes followed immediately behind the\r\ninfantry to which they were attached, sometimes rode on the flanks\r\nof the beasts of burden, at once protecting them and preventing them\r\nfrom straggling. Generally, when advancing through a country in which\r\nit was necessary to guard against a sudden onset, the troops, instead\r\nof proceeding in a loose straggling column, were kept together in\r\nclose compact bodies ready to act in any direction at a moment’s\r\nwarning, and hence an army under these circumstances was said _agmine\r\nquadrato incedere_. Some doubt exists with regard to the force of the\r\nterm _Agmen Pilatum_ as distinguished from _Agmen Quadratum_. Varro\r\ndefines the _agmen pilatum_ as a compact body marching without beasts\r\nof burthen. Where the phrase occurs in poetry, it probably denotes\r\nmerely “columns bristling with spears.” To the preceding particulars\r\nfrom Polybius, the following may be added.\r\n\r\n1. _The levy (delectus.)_ According to the principles of the\r\nconstitution, none were enrolled in the legion, except freeborn\r\ncitizens (_ingenui_) above the age of 17, and under the age of\r\n60, possessing not less than 4000 asses: but in times of peculiar\r\ndifficulty, these conditions were not insisted upon. In such times\r\nall formalities were dispensed with, and every man capable of bearing\r\narms was summoned to join in warding off the threatened danger, a\r\nforce raised under such circumstances being termed _subitarius_ s.\r\n_tumultuarius exercitus_. If citizens between the ages of 17 and 46\r\ndid not appear and answer to their names, they might be punished in\r\nvarious ways,--by fine, by imprisonment, by stripes, by confiscation\r\nof their property, and even, in extreme cases, by being sold\r\nas slaves. At the same time, causes might be alleged which were\r\nrecognised as forming a legitimate ground for exemption (_vacatio\r\njusta militiae_). Thus, all who had served for the full period of 20\r\nyears were relieved from further service, although they might still\r\nbe within the regular age; and so, in like manner, when they were\r\nafflicted by any grievous malady, or disabled by any personal defect,\r\nor engaged in any sacred or civil offices which required their\r\nconstant attendance; but these and similar pleas, although sustained\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, might be rendered void by a decree\r\nof the senate “ne vacationes valerent.” While those who had served\r\nfor the stipulated period were entitled to immunity for the future,\r\neven although within the legal age, and were styled _Emeriti_, so on\r\nthe other hand, it appears from some passages in the classics, that\r\npersons who had not completed their regular term within the usual\r\nlimits, might be forced, if required, to serve between the ages of\r\n45 and 50. Towards the close of the republic, and under the empire,\r\nwhen the legions became permanent, the soldier who had served his\r\nfull time received a regular discharge (_missio_), together with a\r\nbounty (_praemium_) in money or an allotment of land. The jurists\r\ndistinguish three kinds of discharge:--1. _Missio honesta_, granted\r\nfor length of service. 2. _Missio causaria_, in consequence of bad\r\nhealth. 3. _Missio ignominiosa_, when a man was drummed out for\r\nbad conduct. It frequently happened that _emeriti_ were induced to\r\ncontinue in the ranks, either from attachment to the person of the\r\ngeneral, or from hopes of profit or promotion, and were then called\r\n_veterani_, or when they joined an army, in consequence of a special\r\ninvitation, _evocati_.\r\n\r\n2. The division of the legion into _Cohortes_, _Manipuli_,\r\n_Centuriae_, _Signa_, _Ordines_, _Contubernia_.--(i.) _Cohortes._\r\nPolybius takes no notice of the _Cohort_, a division of the legion\r\noften mentioned in the Roman writers. When the soldiers of the\r\nlegion were classified as Velites, Hastati, Principes and Triarii,\r\nthe cohort contained one maniple of each of the three latter\r\ndenominations, together with their complement of Velites, so that\r\nwhen the legion contained 4000, each cohort would consist of 60\r\nTriarii, 120 Principes, 120 Hastati, and 100 Velites, in all 400 men.\r\nThe number of cohorts in a legion being always 10, and the cohorts,\r\nduring the republic, being all equal to each other, the strength of\r\nthe cohort varied from time to time with the strength of the legion,\r\nand thus at different periods ranged between the limits of 300 and\r\n600. They were regularly numbered from 1 to 10, the centurion of\r\nthe first century of the first maniple of the first cohort was the\r\nguardian of the eagle, and hence the first cohort seems always to\r\nhave been regarded as superior in dignity to the rest. Late writers,\r\ninstead of _cohortes_, prefer the somewhat vague term _numeri_,\r\nwhich appears in Tacitus and Suetonius, and perhaps even in Cicero.\r\n_Numeri_ seems to have signified strictly the muster roll, whence\r\nthe phrases _referre in numeros_, _distribuere in numeros_, and\r\nthus served to denote any body of legionaries. Whenever _Cohors_\r\noccurs in the Latin classics in connection with the legion, it\r\nalways signifies a specific division of the legion; but it is very\r\nfrequently found, in the general sense of _battalion_, to denote\r\ntroops altogether distinct from the legion.--(ii.) _Manipulus._ The\r\noriginal meaning of this word, which is derived from _manus_, was _a\r\nhandful or wisp of hay_, _straw_, _fern_, _or the like_, and this,\r\naccording to Roman tradition, affixed to the end of a pole, formed\r\nthe primitive military standard in the days of Romulus. Hence it was\r\napplied to a body of soldiers serving under the same ensign. When\r\nthe phalanx was resolved into small companies marshalled in open\r\norder, these were termed _manipuli_, and down to a very late period\r\nthe common soldiers of the legion were designated as _manipulares_\r\nor _manipularii_, terms equivalent to _gregarii milites_. When the\r\nphalanx was first broken up, it appears that each of the three\r\nclasses of Hastati, Principes, and Triarii, contained 15 maniples;\r\nbut before the second Punic war the number of maniples in each of\r\nthese classes was reduced to 10. Hence it is easy to calculate the\r\nnumber of soldiers in each maniple, according to the varying numbers\r\nin the legion, it being always borne in mind that the Triarii never\r\nexceeded 600, and that the Velites were not divided into maniples,\r\nbut distributed equally among the heavy-armed companies.--(iii.)\r\n_Centuriae._ The distribution of soldiers into _centuriae_ must be\r\nregarded as coeval with the origin of Rome. Plutarch speaks of the\r\nforce led by Romulus against Amulius as formed of centuries; and from\r\nthe close connections between the centuries of Servius Tullius, and\r\nthe organization of the military force, we cannot hesitate to believe\r\nthat the term was communicated to the ranks of the phalanx. For a\r\nlong period after the establishment of the manipular constitution,\r\nthe legion contained 60 centuries.--(iv.) _Signum._ This word is used\r\nto denote a division of the legion, but it is doubtful whether it\r\nsignifies a maniple or a century.--(v.) _Ordo_ generally signifies\r\na century, and _ordinum ductor_ is synonymous with _centurio_, and\r\n_ducere honestum ordinem_ means to be one of the principal centurions\r\nin a legion.--(vi.) _Contubernium._ This was the name given under the\r\nempire to the body of soldiers who were quartered together in the\r\nsame tent.\r\n\r\n3. _Hastati_, _Principes_, _Triarii_, _Pilani_, _Antepilani_,\r\n_Antesignani_, _Principia_.--The _Hastati_ were so called, from\r\nhaving been armed with a _hasta_, the _Principes_ from having\r\noccupied the front line, the _Triarii_, otherwise named _Pilani_,\r\nfrom having been ranged behind the first two lines as a body of\r\nreserve and armed with the _pilum_, while the first two lines\r\nwere termed collectively _Antepilani_, from standing in front of\r\nthe _Pilani_. In process of time, it came to pass, that these\r\ndesignations no longer expressed the actual condition of the\r\ntroops to which they were attached. When Polybius wrote, and long\r\nbefore that period, the _Hastati_ were not armed with _hastae_,\r\nbut in common with the _Principes_ bore the heavy _pilum_: on the\r\nother hand, the _pilani_ carried _hastae_ and not _pila_, while\r\nthe _Principes_ were not drawn up in the front, but formed the\r\nsecond line.--_Antesignani_. While the Hastati and Principes, taken\r\ntogether, were sometimes termed _Antepilani_, in contradistinction\r\nto the Triarii, so the Hastati alone were sometimes termed\r\n_Antesignani_, in contradistinction to the Principes and Triarii\r\ntaken together. The term _Antesignani_ having become established\r\nas denoting the front ranks in a line of battle, was retained in\r\nthis general sense long after the Hastati, Principes, and Triarii\r\nhad disappeared.--Another term employed to denote the front ranks\r\nof an army in battle array is _Principia_, and in this sense must\r\nbe carefully distinguished from the _Principia_ or chief street\r\nin the camp, and from _Principia_, which in the later writers,\r\nsuch as Ammianus and Vegetius, is equivalent to _principales\r\nmilites_. _Postsignani_ does not occur in any author earlier than\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus, and therefore need not be illustrated here;\r\nthe _Subsignanus miles_ of Tacitus seems to be the same with the\r\n_Vexillarii_.\r\n\r\n4. _Rorarii_, _Accensi_, _Ferentarii_, _Velites_,\r\n_Procubitores_.--When the Hastati had, in a great measure, ceased\r\nto act as tirailleurs, their place was supplied by the _Rorarii_,\r\nwhose method of fighting has been described above (p. 165). The\r\n_Accensi_, as described by Livy, were inferior in equipment to the\r\nrorarii, although employed in a similar manner, and seem to have been\r\ncamp-followers or servants, and hence the name is given to those\r\nalso who attended upon magistrates or other officials. At a later\r\nperiod the _accensi_ were supernumeraries, who served to fill up any\r\nvacancies which occurred in the course of a campaign. Another ancient\r\nterm for light-armed soldiers was _Ferentarii_. The _Velites_, called\r\nalso _Procubitores_, because they were employed on outpost duty when\r\nthe Romans were encamped before an enemy, were first formed into a\r\ncorps at the siege of Capua, B.C. 211.\r\n\r\n5. _Officers of the Legion._--_Tribuni Militum_ were the chief\r\nofficers of the legion. Their number (six) did not vary for many\r\ncenturies. They were originally chosen by the commanders-in-chief,\r\nthat is, by the kings in the first instance, and afterwards by the\r\nconsuls, or a dictator, as the case might be. In B.C. 361 the people\r\nassumed to themselves the right of electing either the whole or a\r\ncertain number; and in B.C. 311 it was ordained that they should\r\nchoose sixteen for the four legions. In subsequent times the choice\r\nof the tribunes was divided between the consuls and the people; but\r\nthe proportion chosen by each differed at various periods. No one was\r\neligible to the office of tribune who had not served for ten years\r\nin the infantry or five in the cavalry; but this rule admitted of\r\nexceptions. Augustus introduced certain regulations altogether new.\r\nHe permitted the sons of senators to wear the _tunica laticlavia_ as\r\nsoon as they assumed the manly gown, and to commence their military\r\ncareer as tribunes, or as commanders (_praefecti_) of cavalry. Such\r\npersons were the _Tribuni Laticlavii_.--_Centuriones._ Next in\r\nrank to the Tribunus was the _Centurio_, who, as the name implies,\r\ncommanded a century; and the century, being termed also _ordo_, the\r\ncenturions were frequently designated _ordinum ductores_ (hence,\r\n_adimere ordines_, _offerre ordines_, _ordines impetrare_, _ducere\r\nhonestum ordinem_, to be one of the principal centurions, &c.). The\r\nchief ordinary duties of the centurions were to drill the soldiers,\r\nto inspect their arms, clothing, and food, to watch the execution\r\nof the toils imposed, to visit the centinels, and to regulate the\r\nconduct of their men, both in the camp and in the field. They also\r\nsat as judges in minor offences, and had the power of inflicting\r\ncorporal punishment, whence their badge of office was a vine sapling,\r\nand thus _vitis_ is frequently used to denote the office itself. Of\r\nthe two centurions in each maniple the one first chosen took the\r\ncommand of the right division, the other of the left. The century\r\nto the right was considered as the first century of the maniple,\r\nand its commander took precedence probably with the title _Prior_,\r\nhis companion to the left being called _Posterior_, the _priores_\r\nin each of the three divisions of Triarii, Principes, and Hastati\r\nbeing the ten centurions first chosen. So long as these divisions\r\nwere recognised, all the centurions of the Triarii appear to have\r\nranked before those of the Principes, and all the centurions of the\r\nPrincipes before those of the Hastati. Moreover, since the maniples\r\nwere numbered in each division from 1 to 10, there was probably a\r\nregular progression from the first centurion of the first maniple\r\ndown to the second centurion of the tenth maniple. The first\r\ncenturion of the first maniple of the Triarii, originally named\r\n_Centurio Primus_, and afterwards _Centurio Primipili_, or simply\r\n_Primipilus_, occupied a very conspicuous position. He stood next in\r\nrank to the Tribuni militum; he had a seat in the military council;\r\nto his charge was committed the eagle of the legion, whence he is\r\nsometimes styled _Aquilifer_, and, under the empire at least, his\r\noffice was very lucrative. A series of terms connected with these\r\narrangements are furnished by the narrative which Sp. Ligustinus\r\ngives of his own career (Liv. xlii. 34). He thus enumerates the\r\nvarious steps of his promotion:--“Mihi T. Quinctius Flamininus\r\n_decumum ordinem hastatum_ adsignavit ... me imperator dignum\r\njudicavit cui _primum hastatum prioris centuriae_ adsignaret ... a\r\nM’. Acilio mihi _primus princeps prioris centuriae_ est adsignatus\r\n... quater intra paucos annos _primum pilum duxi_.” The gradual\r\nascent from the ranks being to the post of centurion:--1. In the\r\ntenth maniple of the Hastati. 2. In the first century of the first\r\nmaniple of the Hastati. 3. In the first century of the first maniple\r\nof the Principes. 4. In the first century of the first maniple of the\r\nTriarii.--But even after the distinction between Hastati, Principes,\r\nand Triarii was altogether abolished, and they were all blended\r\ntogether in the cohorts, the same nomenclature with regard to the\r\ncenturies and their commanders was retained, although it is by no\r\nmeans easy to perceive how it was applied. That great differences\r\nof rank existed among the centurions is evident from the phrases\r\n_primores centurionum_, _primi ordines_ (_i.e._ chief centurions),\r\nas opposed to _inferiores ordines_, and _infimi ordines_, and that\r\npromotion from a lower to a higher grade frequently took place,\r\nis evident from many passages in ancient authors. The election of\r\n_optiones_, or lieutenants, by the centurions, has been already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Period. From the times of the Gracchi until the downfall\r\nof the Republic._ After the times of the Gracchi the following\r\nchanges in military affairs may be noticed:--In the first consulship\r\nof Marius the legions were thrown open to citizens of all grades,\r\nwithout distinction of fortune. The whole of the legionaries were\r\narmed and equipped in the same manner, all being now furnished with\r\nthe pilum; and hence we see in Tacitus the _pila_ and _gladii_\r\nof the legionaries, opposed to the _hastae_ and _spathae_ of the\r\nauxiliaries. The legionaries when in battle order were no longer\r\narranged in three lines, each consisting of ten maniples, with an\r\nopen space between each maniple, but in two lines, each consisting\r\nof five cohorts, with a space between each cohort. The younger\r\nsoldiers were no longer placed in the front, but in reserve, the van\r\nbeing composed of veterans, as may be seen from various passages\r\nin Caesar. As a necessary result of the above arrangements, the\r\ndistinction between Hastati, Principes, and Triarii ceased to exist.\r\nThese names, as applied to particular classes of soldiers, are not\r\nfound in Caesar, in Tacitus, nor in any writer upon military affairs\r\nafter the time of Marius. The Velites disappeared. The skirmishers,\r\nincluded under the general term _levis armatura_, consisted for\r\nthe most part of foreign mercenaries possessing peculiar skill in\r\nthe use of some national weapon, such as the Balearic slingers,\r\n(_funditores_), the Cretan archers (_sagittarii_), and the Moorish\r\ndartmen (_jaculatores_). Troops of this description had, it is true,\r\nbeen employed by the Romans even before the second Punic war, and\r\nwere denominated _levium armatorum_ (s. _armorum_) _auxilia_; but now\r\nthe _levis armatura_ consisted exclusively of foreigners, were formed\r\ninto a regular corps under their own officers, and no longer entered\r\ninto the constitution of the legion. When operations requiring\r\ngreat activity were undertaken, such as could not be performed by\r\nmere skirmishers, detachments of legionaries were lightly equipped,\r\nand marched without baggage, for these special services; and hence\r\nthe frequent occurrence of such phrases as _expediti_, _expediti\r\nmilites_, _expeditae cohortes_, and even _expeditae legiones_. The\r\ncavalry of the legion underwent a change in every respect analogous\r\nto that which took place in regard of the light-armed troops. It is\r\nevident, from the history of Caesar’s campaigns in Gaul, that the\r\nnumber of Roman equites attached to his army was very small, and that\r\nthey were chiefly employed as aides-de-camp, and on confidential\r\nmissions. The bulk of Caesar’s cavalry consisted of foreigners, a\r\nfact which becomes strikingly apparent when we read that Ariovistus\r\nhaving stipulated that the Roman general should come to their\r\nconference attended by cavalry alone, Caesar, feeling no confidence\r\nin his Gaulish horse, dismounted them, and supplied their place by\r\nsoldiers of the tenth legion. In like manner they ceased to form\r\npart of the legion, and from this time forward we find the legions\r\nand the cavalry spoken of as completely distinct from each other.\r\nAfter the termination of the Social War, when most of the inhabitants\r\nof Italy became Roman citizens, the ancient distinction between the\r\n_Legiones_ and the _Socii_ disappeared, and all who had served as\r\n_Socii_ became incorporated with the legiones. An army during the\r\nlast years of the republic and under the earlier emperors consisted\r\nof _Romanae Legiones et Auxilia s. Auxiliares_, the latter term\r\ncomprehending troops of all kinds, except the legions. Whenever the\r\nword _socii_ is applied to troops after the date of the Social War,\r\nit is generally to be regarded as equivalent to _auxiliares_. But the\r\nmost important change of all was the establishment of the military\r\n_profession_, and the distinction now first introduced between the\r\ncivilian and the soldier.\r\n\r\n_Fifth Period. From the establishment of the empire until the age of\r\nthe Antonines_, B.C. 31-A.D. 150. Under the empire a regular army\r\nconsisted of a certain number of _Legiones_ and of _Supplementa_,\r\nthe Supplementa being again divided into the imperial guards, which\r\nappear under several different forms, distinguished by different\r\nnames; and the _Auxilia_, which were subdivided into _Sociae\r\nCohortes_ and _Nationes_, the latter being for the most part\r\nbarbarians. The _Legiones_, as already remarked, although still\r\ncomposed of persons who enjoyed the privileges of Roman citizens,\r\nwere now raised almost exclusively in the provinces. The legion was\r\ndivided into 10 cohorts, and each cohort into 6 centuries; the first\r\ncohort, which had the custody of the eagle, was double the size of\r\nthe others, and contained 960 men, the remaining cohorts contained\r\neach 480 men; and consequently each ordinary century 80 men, the\r\ntotal strength of the legion being thus 5280 men.--It is during this\r\nperiod that we first meet with the term _Vexillarii_ or _Vexilla_,\r\nwhich occurs repeatedly in Tacitus. The _vexillarii_, or _vexilla\r\nlegionum_, were those soldiers who, after having served in the legion\r\nfor sixteen years, became _exauctorati_, but continued to serve in\r\ncompany with that legion, under a vexillum of their own, until they\r\nreceived their full discharge. The number attached to each legion\r\nwas usually about five or six hundred.--The term _exauctorare_ also\r\nmeant _to discharge from military service_, but does not appear to\r\nhave been in use before the Augustan period. It signified both a\r\nsimple discharge, and a cashiering on account of some crime. During\r\nthe later period of the empire the latter signification began\r\nalmost exclusively to prevail.--As to the Praetorian troops, see\r\nPRAETORIANI.--From the time when the cavalry were separated from\r\nthe legion they were formed into bodies called _alae_, which varied\r\nin number according to circumstances. The _Alae_ were raised in\r\nthe Roman provinces and consisted, probably, for the most part, of\r\ncitizens, or at least subjects. But in addition to these every army\r\nat this period was attended by squadrons of light horse composed\r\nentirely of barbarians; and the chief duty performed by those named\r\nabove was guiding the pioneers as they performed their labours in\r\nadvance of the army.--_Cohortes peditatae_, were battalions raised\r\nchiefly in the provinces, composed of Roman citizens, of subjects and\r\nallies, or of citizens, allies, and subjects indiscriminately. To\r\nthis class of troops belonged the _cohortes auxiliares_, the _auxilia\r\ncohortium_, and the _sociorum cohortes_, of whom we read in Tacitus,\r\ntogether with a multitude of others recorded in inscriptions and\r\nnamed for the most part from the nations of which they were composed.\r\nThese cohorts were numbered regularly like the legions.--_Cohortes\r\nEquitatae_ differed from the _Peditatae_ in this only, that they\r\nwere made up of infantry combined with cavalry.--_Classici_, which\r\nwe may fairly render _Marines_, were employed, according to Hyginus,\r\nas pioneers. They corresponded to the _Navales Socii_, under the\r\nrepublic, who were always regarded as inferior to regular soldiers.\r\nAfter the establishment by Augustus of regular permanent fleets at\r\nMisenum, Ravenna, and on the coast of Gaul, a large body of men\r\nmust have been required to man them, who were sometimes called\r\nupon to serve as ordinary soldiers.--_Nationes_ were battalions\r\ncomposed entirely of barbarians, or of the most uncivilised among the\r\nsubjects of Rome, and were probably chiefly employed upon outpost\r\nduties.--_Urbanae Cohortes._ Augustus, in addition to the praetorian\r\ncohorts, instituted a force of city guards, amounting to 6000 men\r\ndivided into four battalions. They are usually distinguished as\r\n_Cohortes Urbanae_ or _Urbana militia_, their quarters, which were\r\nwithin the city, being the _Urbana Castra_.--_Cohortes Vigilum._\r\nAugustus also organised a large body of night-watchers, whose\r\nchief duty was to act as firemen. They were divided into seven\r\ncohorts, in the proportion of one cohort to each two _Regiones_,\r\nwere stationed in fourteen guardhouses (_excubitoria_), and called\r\n_Cohortes Vigilum_. They were commanded by a _Praefectus_, who was of\r\nequestrian rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXĬLĬUM. [EXSILIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXŎDĬA (ἐξόδια, from ἐξ and ὁδός) were old-fashioned and laughable\r\ninterludes in verse, inserted in other plays, but chiefly in the\r\nAtellanae. The exodium seems to have been introduced among the Romans\r\nfrom Italian Greece; but after its introduction it became very\r\npopular among the Romans, and continued to be played down to a very\r\nlate period.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXŌMIS (ἐξωμίς), a dress which had only a sleeve for the left arm,\r\nleaving the right with the shoulder and a part of the breast free,\r\nand was for this reason called _exomis_. The exomis was usually worn\r\nby slaves and working people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exomis (Bronze in British Museum).]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXŌMŎSĬA (ἐξωμοσία). Any Athenian citizen when called upon to appear\r\nas a witness in a court of justice (κλητεύειν or ἐκκλητεύειν), was\r\nobliged by law to obey the summons, unless he could establish by\r\noath that he was unacquainted with the case in question. This oath\r\nwas called ἐξωμοσία, and the act of taking it was expressed by\r\nἐξόμνυσθαι. A person appointed to a public office was at liberty to\r\ndecline it, if he could take an oath that the state of his health\r\nor other circumstances rendered it impossible for him to fulfil the\r\nduties connected with it (ἐξόμνυσθαι τὴν ἀρχὴν, or τὴν χειροτονίαν):\r\nand this oath was likewise called ἐξωμοσία, or sometimes ἀπωμοσία.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXOSTRA (ἐξώστρα, from ἐξωθέω), a theatrical machine, by means of\r\nwhich things which had been concealed behind the curtain on the stage\r\nwere pushed or rolled forward from behind it, and thus became visible\r\nto the spectators.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPĔDĪTUS is opposed to _impeditus_, and signifies unincumbered with\r\narmour or with baggage (_impedimenta_). Hence the epithet was often\r\napplied to any portion of the Roman army, when the necessity for\r\nhaste, or the desire to conduct it with the greatest facility from\r\nplace to place, made it desirable to leave behind every weight that\r\ncould be spared.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLŌRĀTŌRES. [SPECULATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXSĔQUĬAE. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXSĬLĬUM (φυγή), banishment. (1) GREEK. Banishment among the Greek\r\nstates seldom, if ever, appears as a punishment appointed by law for\r\nparticular offences. We might, indeed, expect this, for the division\r\nof Greece into a number of independent states would neither admit of\r\nthe establishment of penal colonies, as among us, nor of the various\r\nkinds of exile which we read of under the Roman emperors. The general\r\nterm φυγή (flight) was for the most part applied in the case of those\r\nwho, in order to avoid some punishment or danger, removed from their\r\nown country to another. At Athens it took place chiefly in cases of\r\nhomicide, or murder. An action for wilful murder was brought before\r\nthe Areiopagus, and for manslaughter before the court of the Ephetae.\r\nThe accused might, in either case, withdraw himself (φεύγειν) before\r\nsentence was passed; but when a criminal evaded the punishment to\r\nwhich an act of murder would have exposed him had he remained in his\r\nown land, he was then banished for ever (φεύγει ἀειφυγίαν), and not\r\nallowed to return home even when other exiles were restored upon a\r\ngeneral amnesty. Demosthenes says, that the word φεύγειν was properly\r\napplied to the exile of those who committed murder with malice\r\naforethought, whereas the term μεθίστασθαι was used where the act was\r\nnot intentional. The property also was confiscated in the former\r\ncase, but not in the latter. When a verdict of manslaughter was\r\nreturned, it was usual for the convicted party to leave his country\r\nby a certain road, and to remain in exile till he induced some one\r\nof the relatives of the slain man to take compassion on him. We are\r\nnot informed what were the consequences if the relatives of the slain\r\nman refused to make a reconciliation; supposing that there was no\r\ncompulsion, it is reasonable to conclude that the exile was allowed\r\nto return after a fixed time. Plato, who is believed to have copied\r\nmany of his laws from the constitution of Athens, fixes the period of\r\nbanishment for manslaughter at one year.--Under φυγή, or banishment,\r\nas a general term, is comprehended _Ostracism_, (ὀστρακισμός). Those\r\nthat were ostracised did not lose their property, and the time, as\r\nwell as place of their banishment, was fixed. This ostracism is\r\nsupposed by some to have been instituted by Cleisthenes, after the\r\nexpulsion of the Peisistratidae; its nature and object are thus\r\nexplained by Aristotle:--“Democratical states (he observes) used to\r\nostracise, and remove from the city for a definite time, those who\r\nappeared to be preeminent above their fellow-citizens, by reason\r\nof their wealth, the number of their friends, or any other means\r\nof influence.” Ostracism, therefore, was not a punishment for any\r\ncrime, but rather a precautionary removal of those who possessed\r\nsufficient power in the state to excite either envy or fear. Thus\r\nPlutarch says, it was a good-natured way of allaying envy by the\r\nhumiliation of superior dignity and power. The manner of effecting\r\nit at Athens was as follows:--A space in the _agora_ was enclosed\r\nby barriers, with ten entrances for the ten tribes. By these the\r\ntribesmen entered, each with his _ostracon_ (ὄστρακον), or piece of\r\ntile (whence the name _ostracism_), on which was written the name\r\nof the individual whom he wished to be ostracised. The nine archons\r\nand the senate, _i.e._ the presidents of that body, superintended\r\nthe proceedings, and the party who had the greatest number of votes\r\nagainst him, supposing that this number amounted to 6000, was obliged\r\nto withdraw (μεταστῆναι) from the city within ten days; if the number\r\nof votes did not amount to 6000, nothing was done. Some of the most\r\ndistinguished men at Athens were removed by ostracism, but recalled\r\nwhen the city found their services indispensable. Among these were\r\nThemistocles, Aristeides, and Cimon, son of Miltiades. The last\r\nperson against whom it was used at Athens was Hyperbolus, a demagogue\r\nof low birth and character; but the Athenians thought their own\r\ndignity compromised, and ostracism degraded by such an application of\r\nit, and accordingly discontinued the practice.--From the ostracism\r\nof Athens was copied the _Petalism_ (πεταλισμός) of the Syracusans,\r\nso called from the πέταλον, or leaf of the olive, on which was\r\nwritten the name of the person whom they wished to remove from the\r\ncity. The removal, however, was only for five years; a sufficient\r\ntime, as they thought, to humble the pride and hopes of the exile.\r\nIn connection with petalism it may be remarked, that if any one were\r\nfalsely registered in a demus, or ward, at Athens, his expulsion was\r\ncalled ἐκφυλλοφορία, from the votes being given by leaves. Besides\r\nthose exiled by law, or ostracised, there was frequently a great\r\nnumber of political exiles in Greece; men who, having distinguished\r\nthemselves as the leaders of one party, were expelled, or obliged\r\nto remove from their native city, when the opposite faction became\r\npredominant. They are spoken of as οἱ φεύγοντες or οἱ ἐκπεσόντες, and\r\nas οἱ κατελθόντες after their return (ἡ κάθοδος) the word κατάγειν\r\nbeing applied to those who were instrumental in effecting it.--(2)\r\nROMAN. Banishment as a punishment did not exist in the old Roman\r\nstate. The _aquae et ignis interdictio_, which we so frequently read\r\nof in the republican period, was in reality not banishment, for\r\nit was only a ban, pronounced by the people (by a _lex_), or by a\r\nmagistrate in a criminal court, by which a person was deprived of\r\nwater and of fire; that is, of the first necessaries of life; and its\r\neffect was to incapacitate a person from exercising the rights of a\r\ncitizen; in other words, to deprive him of his citizenship. Such a\r\nperson might, if he chose, remain at Rome, and submit to the penalty\r\nof being an outcast, incapacitated from doing any legal act, and\r\nliable to be killed by any one with impunity. To avoid these dangers,\r\na person suffering under such an interdict would naturally withdraw\r\nfrom Rome, and in the earlier republican period, if he withdrew to\r\na state between which and Rome isopolitical relations existed, he\r\nwould become a citizen of that state. This right was called _jus\r\nexsulandi_ with reference to the state to which the person came;\r\nwith respect to his own state, which he left, he was _exsul_, and\r\nhis condition was _exsilium_; and with respect to the state which\r\nhe entered, he was _inquilinus_.[2] In the same way a citizen of\r\nsuch a state had a right of going into exsilium at Rome; and at\r\nRome he might attach himself (_applicare se_) to a quasi-patronus.\r\nExsilium, instead of being a punishment, would thus rather be a\r\nmode of evading punishment; but towards the end of the republic the\r\n_aquae et ignis interdictio_ became a regular banishment, since the\r\nsentence usually specified certain limits, within which a person\r\nwas interdicted from fire and water. Thus Cicero was interdicted\r\nfrom fire and water within 400 miles from the city. The punishment\r\nwas inflicted for various crimes, as _vis publica_, _peculatus_,\r\n_veneficium_, &c. Under the empire there were two kinds of exsilium;\r\n_exsilium_ properly so called, and _relegatio_; the great distinction\r\nbetween the two was, that the former deprived a person of his\r\ncitizenship, while the latter did not. The distinction between\r\n_exsilium_ and _relegatio_ existed under the republic. Ovid also\r\ndescribes himself, not as _exsul_, which he considers a term of\r\nreproach, but as _relegatus_. The chief species of exsilium was the\r\n_deportatio in insulam_ or _deportatio_ simply, which was introduced\r\nunder the emperors in place of the _aquae et ignis interdictio_.\r\nThe _relegatio_ merely confined the person within, or excluded him\r\nfrom particular places. In the latter case it was called _fuga\r\nlata_, _fuga libera_, or _liberum exsilium_. The _relegatus_ went\r\ninto banishment; the _deportatus_ was conducted to his place of\r\nbanishment, sometimes in chains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] This word appears, by its termination _inus_, to denote a person\r\nwho was one of a class, like the word _libertinus_. The prefix _in_\r\nappears to be the correlative of _ex_ in _exsul_, and the remaining\r\npart _quil_ is probably related to _col_ in _incola_ and _colonus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTISPEX. [HARUSPEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRĂORDĬNĀRĬI. [EXERCITUS, p. 167.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFABRI are workmen who make anything out of hard materials, as _fabri\r\ntignarii_, carpenters, _fabri aerarii_, smiths, &c. The different\r\ntrades were divided by Numa into nine collegia, which correspond to\r\nour companies or guilds. In the constitution of Servius Tullius, the\r\n_fabri tignarii_ and the _fabri aerarii_ or _ferrarii_ were formed\r\ninto two centuries, which were called the centuriae _fabrum_ (not\r\n_fabrorum_). They did not belong to any of the five classes into\r\nwhich Servius divided the people; but the _fabri tign._ probably\r\nvoted with the first class, and the _fabri aer._ with the second.\r\nThe fabri in the army were under the command of an officer called\r\n_praefectus fabrûm_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFĂBŬLA. [COMOEDIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFĂLĀRĬCA. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSUM. The oldest legislative provision at Rome against Falsum\r\nwas that of the Twelve Tables against false testimony. The next\r\nlegislation on Falsum, so far as we know, was a Lex Cornelia, passed\r\nin the time of the Dictator Sulla against forging, concealing,\r\ndestroying, or committing any other fraudulent act respecting a\r\nwill or other instrument. The offence was a Crimen Publicum, and,\r\nunder the emperors, the punishment was deportatio in insulam for the\r\n“honestiores;” and the mines or crucifixion for the “humiliores.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFALX, _dim._ FALCŬLA (ἅρπη, δρέπανον, _poet._ δρεπάνη, _dim._\r\nδρεπάνιον), a sickle; a scythe; a pruning-knife; a falchion, &c. As\r\n_Culter_ denoted a knife with one straight edge, _falx_ signified\r\nany similar instrument, the single edge of which was curved. Some of\r\nits forms are given in the annexed cut. One represents Perseus with\r\nthe falchion in his right hand, and the head of Medusa in his left.\r\nThe two smaller figures are heads of Saturn with the falx in its\r\noriginal form; and the fourth represents the same divinity at full\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Falx. (From ancient Cameos.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFĂMĬLĬA. The word _familia_ contains the same element as the word\r\nfamulus, a slave, and the verb _famulari_. In its widest sense it\r\nsignifies the totality of that which belongs to a Roman citizen\r\nwho is sui juris, and therefore a paterfamilias. Thus, in certain\r\ncases of testamentary disposition, the word _familia_ is explained\r\nby the equivalent _patrimonium_; and the person who received the\r\nfamilia from the testator was called _familiae emptor_. But the\r\nword _familia_ is sometimes limited to signify “persons,” that is,\r\nall those who are in the power of a paterfamilias, such as his sons\r\n(_filii-familias_), daughters, grandchildren, and slaves. Sometimes\r\n_familia_ is used to signify the slaves belonging to a person, or to\r\na body of persons (_societas_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFĀNUM. [TEMPLUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFARTOR, a slave who fattened poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFASCES, rods bound in the form of a bundle, and containing an axe\r\n(_securis_) in the middle, the iron of which projected from them.\r\nThey were usually made of birch, but sometimes also of the twigs of\r\nthe elm. They are said to have been derived from Vetulonia, a city\r\nof Etruria. Twelve were carried before each of the kings by twelve\r\nlictors; and on the expulsion of the Tarquins, one of the consuls was\r\npreceded by twelve lictors with the fasces and secures, and the other\r\nby the same number of lictors with the fasces only, or, according to\r\nsome accounts, with crowns around them. But P. Valerius Publicola,\r\nwho gave to the people the right of provocatio, ordained that the\r\nsecures should be removed from the fasces, and allowed only one of\r\nthe consuls to be preceded by the lictors while they were at Rome.\r\nThe other consul was attended only by a single accensus [ACCENSUS].\r\nWhen they were out of Rome, and at the head of the army, each of\r\nthe consuls retained the axe in the fasces, and was preceded by his\r\nown lictors, as before the time of Valerius. The fasces and secures\r\nwere, however, carried before the dictator even in the city, and he\r\nwas also preceded by twenty-four lictors, and the magister equitum\r\nby six. The praetors were preceded in the city by two lictors with\r\nthe fasces; but out of Rome and at the head of an army by six, with\r\nthe fasces and secures. The tribunes of the plebs, the aediles and\r\nquaestors, had no lictors in the city, but in the provinces the\r\nquaestors were permitted to have the fasces. The lictors carried the\r\nfasces on their shoulders; and when an inferior magistrate met one\r\nwho was higher in rank, the lictors lowered their fasces to him.\r\nThis was done by Valerius Publicola, when he addressed the people,\r\nand hence came the expression _submittere fasces_ in the sense of to\r\nyield, to confess one’s self inferior to another. When a general had\r\ngained a victory, and had been saluted as Imperator by his soldiers,\r\nhe usually crowned his fasces with laurel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fasces. (From the original in the Capitol at Rome.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFASCĬA, a band or fillet of cloth, worn, (1) round the head as an\r\nensign of royalty;--(2) by women over the breast;--(3) round the legs\r\nand feet, especially by women. When the toga had fallen into disuse,\r\nand the shorter pallium was worn in its stead, so that the legs were\r\nnaked and exposed, _fasciae crurales_ became common even with the\r\nmale sex.\r\n\r\n\r\nFASCĬNUM (βασκανία), fascination, enchantment. The belief that\r\nsome persons had the power of injuring others by their looks, was\r\nprevalent among the Greeks and Romans. The evil eye was supposed\r\nto injure children particularly, but sometimes cattle also; whence\r\nVirgil (_Ecl._ iii. 103) says,\r\n\r\n      “Nescio quis teneros oculos mihi fascinat agnum.”\r\n\r\nVarious amulets were used to avert its influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFASTI. _Fas_ signifies _divine law_: the epithet _fastus_ is\r\nproperly applied to anything in accordance with divine law; and\r\nhence those days upon which legal business might, without impiety\r\n(_sine piaculo_), be transacted before the praetor, were technically\r\ndenominated _fasti dies_, i.e. _lawful days_. The sacred books in\r\nwhich the _fasti dies_ of the year were marked were themselves\r\ndenominated _fasti_; the term, however, was employed to denote\r\nregisters of various descriptions. Of these the two principal are\r\nthe _Fasti Sacri_ or _Fasti Kalendares_, and _Fasti Annales_ or\r\n_Fasti Historici_.--I. FASTI SACRI or KALENDARES. For nearly four\r\ncenturies and a half after the foundation of the city a knowledge\r\nof the calendar was possessed exclusively by the priests. One of\r\nthe pontifices regularly proclaimed the appearance of the new moon,\r\nand at the same time announced the period which would intervene\r\nbetween the Kalends and the Nones. On the Nones the country people\r\nassembled for the purpose of learning from the rex sacrorum the\r\nvarious festivals to be celebrated during the month, and the days\r\non which they would fall. In like manner all who wished to go to\r\nlaw were obliged to inquire of the privileged few on what day they\r\nmight bring their suit, and received the reply as if from the lips\r\nof an astrologer. The whole of this lore, so long a source of power\r\nand profit, and therefore jealously enveloped in mystery, was at\r\nlength made public by a certain Cn. Flavius, scribe to App. Claudius;\r\nwho, having gained access to the pontifical books, copied out all\r\nthe requisite information, and exhibited it in the forum for the\r\nuse of the people at large. From this time forward such tables\r\nbecame common, and were known by the name of _Fasti_. They usually\r\ncontained an enumeration of the months and days of the year; the\r\nNones, Ides, Nundinae, Dies Fasti, Nefasti, Comitiales, Atri, &c.,\r\ntogether with the different festivals, were marked in their proper\r\nplaces: astronomical observations on the risings and settings of the\r\nfixed stars, and the commencement of the seasons were frequently\r\ninserted. [CALENDARIUM; DIES.]--II. FASTI ANNALES or HISTORICI.\r\nChronicles such as the _Annales Maximi_, containing the names of the\r\nchief magistrates for each year, and a short account of the most\r\nremarkable events noted down opposite to the days on which they\r\noccurred, were, from the resemblance which they bore in arrangement\r\nto the sacred calendars, denominated _fasti_; and hence this word is\r\nused, especially by the poets, in the general sense of _historical\r\nrecords_. In prose writers _fasti_ is commonly employed as the\r\ntechnical term for the registers of consuls, dictators, censors, and\r\nother magistrates, which formed part of the public archives. Some\r\nmost important _fasti_ belonging to this class, executed probably\r\nat the beginning of the reign of Tiberius, have been partially\r\npreserved, and are deposited in the Capitol in Rome, where they are\r\nknown by the name of the _Fasti Capitolini_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFASTĬGĬUM. An ancient Greek or Roman temple, of rectangular\r\nconstruction, is terminated at its upper extremity by a triangular\r\nfigure, both in front and rear, which rests upon the cornice of the\r\nentablature as a base, and has its sides formed by the cornices which\r\nterminate the roof. The whole of this triangle above the trabeation\r\nis implied in the term _fastigium_, called ἀέτωμα by the Greeks,\r\npediment by our architects. The dwelling-houses of the Romans had no\r\ngable ends; consequently when the word is applied to them, it is not\r\nin its strictly technical sense, but designates the roof simply, and\r\nis to be understood of one which rises to an apex, as distinguished\r\nfrom a flat one. The fastigium, properly so called, was appropriated\r\nto the temples of the gods; therefore, when the Romans began to\r\nbestow divine honours upon Julius Caesar, amongst other privileges\r\nwhich they decreed to him, was the liberty of erecting a fastigium to\r\nhis house, that is, a portico and pediment towards the street, like\r\nthat of a temple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fastigium. (From a Coin.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAX (φανός), a torch. As the principal use of torches was to\r\ngive light to those who went abroad after sunset, the portion of\r\nthe Roman day immediately succeeding sun-set was called _fax_ or\r\n_prima fax_. The use of torches after sun-set, and the practice of\r\ncelebrating marriages at that time, probably led to the consideration\r\nof the torch as one of the necessary accompaniments and symbols of\r\nmarriage. Among the Romans the _fax nuptialis_ having been lighted\r\nat the parental hearth, was carried before the bride by a boy whose\r\nparents were alive. The torch was also carried at funerals (_fax\r\nsepulchralis_), both because these were often nocturnal ceremonies,\r\nand because it was used to set fire to the pile.\r\n\r\n\r\nFĒCIĀLES. [FETIALES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFĔMĬNĀLĬA, worn in winter by Augustus Caesar, who was very\r\nsusceptible of cold. It seems probable that they were breeches\r\nresembling ours.\r\n\r\n\r\nFĔNESTRA. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFĒNUS or FOENUS (τόκος), interest of money.--(1) GREEK. At Athens\r\nthere was no restriction upon the rate of interest. A rate might be\r\nexpressed or represented in two different ways: (1.) by the number\r\nof oboli or drachmae paid by the _month_ for every _mina_; (2) by\r\nthe part of the principal (τὸ ἀρχαῖον or κεφάλαιον) paid as interest\r\neither annually or for the whole period of the loan. According to the\r\nformer method, which was generally used when money was lent upon real\r\nsecurity (τόκοι ἔγγυοι or ἔγγειοι), different rates were expressed as\r\nfollows:--10 per cent. by ἐπὶ πέντε ὀβολοῖς, _i.e._ 5 oboli per month\r\nfor every mina, or 60 oboli a year = 10 drachmae = 1/10 of a mina.\r\nSimilarly,\r\n\r\n  12 per cent. by ἐπὶ δραχμῇ         per month.\r\n  16 per cent.  ” ἐπ’ ὀκτὼ ὀβολοῖς        ”\r\n  18 per cent.  ” ἐπ’ ἐννέα ὀβολοῖς       ”\r\n  24 per cent.  ” ἐπὶ δυσὶ δραχμαῖς       ”\r\n  36 per cent.  ” ἐπὶ τρισὶ δρακμαῖς      ”\r\n   5 per cent.  ” ἐπὶ τρίτῳ ἡμιοβολίῳ, probably.\r\n\r\nAnother method was generally adopted in cases of bottomry (τὸ\r\nναυτικόν, τόκοι ναυτικοί, or ἔκδοσις), where money was lent upon\r\nthe ship’s cargo or freightage (ἐπὶ τῷ ναύλῳ), or the ship itself,\r\nfor a specified time, commonly that of the voyage. By this method\r\nthe following rates were thus represented:--10 per cent. by τόκοι\r\nἐπιδέκατοι, i.e. interest at the rate of a tenth; 12½, 16⅔, 20, 33⅓,\r\nby τόκοι ἐπόγδοοι, ἔφεκτοι, ἐπίπεμπτοι, and ἐπίτριτοι, respectively.\r\nThe usual rates of interest at Athens about the time of Demosthenes\r\nvaried from 12 to 18 per cent.--(2) ROMAN. Towards the close of\r\nthe republic, and also under the emperors, 12 per cent. was the\r\nlegal rate of interest. The interest became due on the first of\r\nevery month: hence the phrases _tristes_ or _celeres calendae_ and\r\n_calendarium_, the latter meaning a debt-book or book of accounts.\r\nThe rate of interest was expressed in the time of Cicero, and\r\nafterwards, by means of the as and its divisions, according to the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\n  Asses usurae, or one as per\r\n    month for the use of one\r\n    hundred                    = 12  per cent.\r\n  Deunces  usurae                11     ”\r\n  Dextantes  ”                   10     ”\r\n  Dodrantes  ”                    9     ”\r\n  Besses     ”                    8     ”\r\n  Septunces  ”                    7     ”\r\n  Semisses   ”                    6     ”\r\n  Quincunces ”                    5     ”\r\n  Trientes   ”                    4     ”\r\n  Quadrantes ”                    3     ”\r\n  Sextantes  ”                    2     ”\r\n  Unciae     ”                    1     ”\r\n\r\nInstead of the phrase _asses usurae_, a synonyme was used, viz.\r\n_centesimae usurae_, inasmuch as at this rate of interest there was\r\npaid in a hundred months a sum equal to the whole principal. Hence\r\n_binae centesimae_ = 24 per cent., and _quaternae centesimae_ = 48\r\nper cent. The monthly rate of the centesimae was of foreign origin,\r\nand first adopted at Rome in the time of Sulla. The old _yearly_\r\nrate established by the Twelve Tables (B.C. 450) was the _unciarium\r\nfenus_. The _uncia_ was the twelfth part of the as, and since the\r\nfull (12 oz.) copper coinage was still in use at Rome when the Twelve\r\nTables became law, the phrase _unciarium_ fenus would be a natural\r\nexpression for interest of one ounce in the pound; _i.e._ a twelfth\r\npart of the sum borrowed, or 8⅓ per cent., not per month, but per\r\nyear. This rate, if calculated for the old Roman year of ten months,\r\nwould give 10 per cent. for the civil year of twelve months, which\r\nwas in common use in the time of the decemvirs. If a debtor could\r\nnot pay the principal and interest at the end of the year, he used\r\nto borrow money from a fresh creditor, to pay off his old debt. This\r\nproceeding was very frequent, and called a _versura_. It amounted\r\nto little short of paying compound interest, or an _anatocismus\r\nanniversarius_, another phrase for which was _usurae renovatae_;\r\n_e.g._ _centesimae renovatae_ is 12 per cent. compound interest, to\r\nwhich Cicero opposes _centesimae perpetuo fenore_ = 12 per cent.\r\nsimple interest. The following phrases are of common occurrence in\r\nconnection with borrowing and lending money at interest:--_Pecuniam\r\napud aliquem collocare_, to lend money at interest; _relegere_, to\r\ncall it in again; _cavere_, to give security for it; _opponere_\r\nor _opponere pignori_, to give as a pledge or mortgage. The word\r\n_nomen_ is also of extensive use in money transactions. Properly it\r\ndenoted the name of a debtor, registered in a banker’s or any other\r\naccount-book: hence it came to signify the articles of an account, a\r\ndebtor, or a debt itself. Thus we have _bonum nomen_, a good debt;\r\n_nomina facere_, to lend monies, and also to borrow money.\r\n\r\n\r\nFĒRĀLIA. [FUNUS, p. 191, a.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFERCŬLUM (from _fer-o_) is applied to any kind of tray or platform\r\nused for carrying anything. Thus it is used to signify the tray or\r\nframe on which several dishes were brought in at once at dinner; and\r\nhence _fercula_ came to mean the number of courses at dinner, and\r\neven the dishes themselves. The ferculum was also used for carrying\r\nthe images of the gods in the procession of the circus, the ashes\r\nof the dead in a funeral, and the spoils in a triumph; in all which\r\ncases it appears to have been carried on the shoulders or in the\r\nhands of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFĔRĔTRUM. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFĒRĬAE, holidays, were, generally speaking, days or seasons during\r\nwhich free-born Romans suspended their political transactions and\r\ntheir law-suits, and during which slaves enjoyed a cessation from\r\nlabour. All feriae were thus _dies nefasti_. The feriae included\r\nall days consecrated to any deity; consequently all days on which\r\npublic festivals were celebrated were feriae or dies feriati. But\r\nsome of them, such as the feria vindemialis, and the feriae aestivae,\r\nseem to have had no direct connection with the worship of the gods.\r\nThe nundinae, however, during the time of the kings and the early\r\nperiod of the republic, were feriae only for the populus, and days\r\nof business for the plebeians, until, by the Hortensian law, they\r\nbecame fasti or days of business for both orders. All _feriae\r\npublicae_, _i.e._ those which were observed by the whole nation,\r\nwere divided into _feriae stativae_, _feriae conceptivae_, and\r\n_feriae imperativae_. _Feriae stativae_ or _statae_ were those which\r\nwere held regularly, and on certain days marked in the calendar. To\r\nthese belonged some of the great festivals, such as the Agonalia,\r\nCarmentalia, Lupercalia, &c. _Feriae conceptivae_ or _conceptae_\r\nwere held every year, but not on certain or fixed days, the time\r\nbeing every year appointed by the magistrates or priests. Among these\r\nwe may mention the feriae Latinae, feriae Sementivae, Paganalia,\r\nand Compitalia. _Feriae imperativae_ were those which were held on\r\ncertain emergencies at the command of the consuls, praetors, or of\r\na dictator. The manner in which all public feriae were kept bears\r\ngreat analogy to the observance of our Sunday. The people visited the\r\ntemples of the gods, and offered up their prayers and sacrifices. The\r\nmost serious and solemn seem to have been the feriae imperativae, but\r\nall the others were generally attended with rejoicings and feasting.\r\nAll kinds of business, especially law-suits, were suspended during\r\nthe public feriae, as they were considered to pollute the sacred\r\nseason. The most important of the holidays designated by the name of\r\nferiae, are the _Feriae Latinae_, or simply _Latinae_ (the original\r\nname was _Latiar_), which were said to have been instituted by the\r\nlast Tarquin in commemoration of the alliance between the Romans and\r\nLatins. This festival, however, was of much higher antiquity; it was\r\na panegyris, or a festival, of the whole Latin nation, celebrated on\r\nthe Alban mount; and all that the last Tarquin did was to convert the\r\noriginal Latin festival into a Roman one, and to make it the means\r\nof hallowing and cementing the alliance between the two nations.\r\nBefore the union, the chief magistrate of the Latins had presided\r\nat the festival; but Tarquin now assumed this distinction, which\r\nsubsequently, after the destruction of the Latin commonwealth,\r\nremained with the chief magistrates of Rome. The object of this\r\npanegyris on the Alban mount was the worship of Jupiter Latiaris,\r\nand, at least as long as the Latin republic existed, to deliberate\r\nand decide on matters of the confederacy, and to settle any disputes\r\nwhich might have arisen among its members. As the feriae Latinae\r\nbelonged to the conceptivae, the time of their celebration greatly\r\ndepended on the state of affairs at Rome, since the consuls were\r\nnever allowed to take the field until they had held the Latinae. This\r\nfestival was a great engine in the hands of the magistrates, who\r\nhad to appoint the time of its celebration (_concipere_, _edicere_,\r\nor _indicere Latinas_); as it might often suit their purpose either\r\nto hold the festival at a particular time or to delay it, in order\r\nto prevent or delay such public proceedings as seemed injurious and\r\npernicious, and to promote others to which they were favourably\r\ndisposed. The festival lasted six days.\r\n\r\n\r\nFESCENNINA, scil. _carmina_, one of the earliest kinds of Italian\r\npoetry, which consisted of rude and jocose verses, or rather\r\ndialogues of extempore verses, in which the merry country folks\r\nassailed and ridiculed one another. This amusement seems originally\r\nto have been peculiar to country people, but it was also introduced\r\ninto the towns of Italy and at Rome, where we find it mentioned as\r\none of those in which young people indulged at weddings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFĒTĬĀLES or FĒCĬĀLES, a college of Roman priests, who acted as\r\nthe guardians of the public faith. It was their province, when\r\nany dispute arose with a foreign state, to demand satisfaction,\r\nto determine the circumstances under which hostilities might be\r\ncommenced, to perform the various religious rites attendant on the\r\nsolemn declaration of war, and to preside at the formal ratification\r\nof peace. When an injury had been received from a foreign state,\r\nfour fetiales were deputed to seek redress, who again elected one\r\nof their number to act as their representative. This individual was\r\nstyled the _pater patratus populi Romani_. A fillet of white wool was\r\nbound round his head, together with a wreath of sacred herbs gathered\r\nwithin the inclosure of the Capitoline hill (_Verbenae_; _Sagmina_),\r\nwhence he was sometimes named _Verbenarius_. Thus equipped, he\r\nproceeded to the confines of the offending tribe, where he halted,\r\nand addressed a prayer to Jupiter, calling the god to witness, with\r\nheavy imprecations, that his complaints were well founded and his\r\ndemands reasonable. He then crossed the border, and the same form was\r\nrepeated in nearly the same words to the first native of the soil\r\nwhom he might chance to meet; again a third time to the sentinel or\r\nany citizen whom he encountered at the gate of the chief town; and\r\na fourth time to the magistrates in the forum in presence of the\r\npeople. If a satisfactory answer was not returned within thirty days,\r\nafter publicly delivering a solemn denunciation of what might be\r\nexpected to follow, he returned to Rome, and, accompanied by the rest\r\nof the fetiales, made a report of his mission to the senate. If the\r\npeople, as well as the senate, decided for war, the pater patratus\r\nagain set forth to the border of the hostile territory, and launched\r\na spear tipped with iron, or charred at the extremity and smeared\r\nwith blood (emblematic doubtless of fire and slaughter), across the\r\nboundary, pronouncing at the same time a solemn declaration of war.\r\nThe demand for redress, and the proclamation of hostilities, were\r\nalike termed _clarigatio_. The whole system is said to have been\r\nborrowed from the Aequicolae or the Ardeates, and similar usages\r\nundoubtedly prevailed among the Latin states. The number of the\r\nfetiales cannot be ascertained with certainty, but they were probably\r\ntwenty. They were originally selected from the most noble families,\r\nand their office lasted for life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFĪBŬLA (περόνη, πόρπη), a brooch or buckle, consisting of a pin\r\n(_acus_), and of a curved portion furnished with a hook (κλείς).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fibulae, brooches or buckles. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFICTĬLE (κεράμος, κεράμιον, ὄστρακον, ὀστράκινον), earthenware, a\r\nvessel or other article made of baked clay. The instruments used in\r\npottery (_ars figulina_) were the following:--1. The wheel (τροχός,\r\n_orbis_, _rota_, _rota figularis_). 2. Pieces of wood or bone, which\r\nthe potter (κεραμεύς, _figulus_) held in his right hand, and applied\r\noccasionally to the surface of the clay during its revolution. 3.\r\nMoulds (_formae_, τύποι), used either to decorate with figures in\r\nrelief vessels which had been thrown on the wheel, or to produce\r\nfoliage, animals, or any other appearances, on Antefixa, on cornices\r\nof terra cotta, and imitative or ornamental pottery of all other\r\nkinds, in which the wheel was not adapted to give the first shape. 4.\r\nGravers or scalpels, used by skilful modellers in giving to figures\r\nof all kinds a more perfect finish and a higher relief than could\r\nbe produced by the use of moulds. The earth used for making pottery\r\n(κεράμικη γῆ), was commonly red, and often of so lively a colour\r\nas to resemble coral. Other pottery is brown or cream-coloured,\r\nand sometimes white. Some of the ancient earthenware is throughout\r\nits substance black, an effect produced by mixing the earth with\r\ncomminuted asphaltum (_gagates_), or with some other bituminous or\r\noleaginous substance. It appears also that asphaltum, with pitch and\r\ntar, both mineral and vegetable, was used to cover the surface like a\r\nvarnish. The best pottery was manufactured at Athens, in the island\r\nof Samos, and in Etruria. A quarter of Athens was called Cerameicus,\r\nbecause it was inhabited by potters. Vessels, before being sent for\r\nthe last time to the furnace, were sometimes immersed in that finely\r\nprepared mud, now technically called “slip,” by which the surface\r\nis both smoothed and glazed, and at the same time receives a fresh\r\ncolour. Ruddle, or red ochre (μίλτος, _rubrica_), was principally\r\nemployed for this purpose. To produce a further variety in the\r\npaintings upon vases the artists employed a few brightly coloured\r\nearths and metallic ores. [PICTURA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFĬDEICOMMISSUM may be defined to be a testamentary disposition,\r\nby which a person who gives a thing to another imposes on him the\r\nobligation of transferring it to a third person. The obligation was\r\nnot created by words of legal binding force (_civilia verba_), but\r\nby words of request (_precativè_), such as _fideicommitto_, _peto_,\r\n_volo dari_, and the like; which were the operative words (_verba\r\nutilia_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFĪDŪCĬA. If a man transferred his property to another, on condition\r\nthat it should be restored to him, this contract was called Fiducia,\r\nand the person to whom the property was so transferred was said\r\n_fiduciam accipere_. The trustee was bound to discharge his trust\r\nby restoring the thing: if he did not, he was liable to an actio\r\nfiduciae or fiduciaria, which was an actio bonae fidei. If the\r\ntrustee was condemned in the action, the consequence was infamia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISCUS, the imperial treasury. Under the republic the public treasury\r\nwas called _Aerarium_. [AERARIUM.] On the establishment of the\r\nimperial power, there was a division of the provinces between the\r\nsenate, as the representative of the old republic, and the Caesar or\r\nemperor; and there was consequently a division of the most important\r\nbranches of public income and expenditure. The property of the senate\r\nretained the name of _Aerarium_, and that of the Caesar, as such,\r\nreceived the name of _Fiscus_. The private property of the Caesar\r\n(_res privata principis, ratio Caesaris_) was quite distinct from\r\nthat of the fiscus. The word fiscus signified a wicker-basket, or\r\npannier, in which the Romans were accustomed to keep and carry about\r\nlarge sums of money; and hence fiscus came to signify any person’s\r\ntreasure or money chest. The importance of the imperial fiscus soon\r\nled to the practice of appropriating the name to that property which\r\nthe Caesar claimed as Caesar, and the word fiscus, without any\r\nadjunct, was used in this sense. Ultimately the word came to signify\r\ngenerally the property of the state, the Caesar having concentrated\r\nin himself all the sovereign power, and thus the word fiscus finally\r\nhad the same signification as aerarium in the republican period.\r\nVarious officers, as Procuratores, Advocati, Patroni, and Praefecti,\r\nwere employed in the administration of the fiscus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLĀBELLUM, _dim._ FLĀBELLŬLUM, (ῥιπίς), a fan. Fans were of elegant\r\nforms, of delicate colours, and sometimes of costly and splendid\r\nmaterials, such as peacock’s feathers; but they were stiff and of a\r\nfixed shape, and were held by female slaves (_flabelliferae_), by\r\nbeautiful boys, or by eunuchs, whose duty it was to wave them so as\r\nto produce a cooling breeze. Besides separate feathers the ancient\r\nfan was sometimes made of linen, extended upon a light frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flagellum, Scourge. (From a Bas-relief at Rome, and\r\nfrom a Coin.)]\r\n\r\nFLAGRUM, _dim._ FLĂGELLUM (μάστιξ), a whip, a scourge, to the\r\nhandle of which was fixed a lash made of cords (_funibus_), or\r\nthongs of leather (_loris_), especially thongs made from the ox’s\r\nhide (_bubulis exuviis_). The _flagellum_ properly so called was\r\na dreadful instrument, and is thus put in opposition to the\r\n_scutica_, which was a simple whip. (Hor. _Sat._ i. 3. 119.) Cicero\r\nin like manner contrasts the severe _flagella_ with the _virgae_.\r\nThe flagellum was chiefly used in the punishment of slaves. It was\r\nknotted with bones or heavy indented circles of bronze or terminated\r\nby hooks, in which case it was aptly denominated a _scorpion_. We\r\nlikewise find that some gladiators fought with the flagella, as in\r\nthe coin here introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLĀMEN, the name for any Roman priest who was devoted to the service\r\nof one particular god, and who received a distinguishing epithet\r\nfrom the deity to whom he ministered. The most dignified were those\r\nattached to Dijovis, Mars, and Quirinus, the _Flamen Dialis_,\r\n_Flamen Martialis_, and _Flamen Quirinalis_. They are said to have\r\nbeen established by Numa. The number was eventually increased to\r\nfifteen: the three original flamens were always chosen from among\r\nthe patricians, and styled _Majores_; the rest from the plebeians,\r\nwith the epithet _Minores_. Among the minores, we read of the _Flamen\r\nFloralis_, the _Flamen Carmentalis_, &c. The flamens were elected\r\noriginally at the Comitia Curiata, but it is conjectured that\r\nsubsequently to the passing of the _Lex Domitia_ (B.C. 104) they\r\nwere chosen in the Comitia Tributa. After being nominated by the\r\npeople, they were received (_capti_) and installed (_inaugurabantur_)\r\nby the pontifex maximus, to whose authority they were at all times\r\nsubject. The office was understood to last for life; but a flamen\r\nmight be compelled to resign (_flaminio abire_) for a breach of\r\nduty, or even on account of the occurrence of an ill-omened accident\r\nwhile discharging his functions. Their characteristic dress was the\r\n_apex_ [APEX], the _laena_ [LAENA], and a laurel wreath. The most\r\ndistinguished of all the flamens was the _Dialis_; the lowest in rank\r\nthe _Pomonalis_. The former enjoyed many peculiar honours. When a\r\nvacancy occurred, three persons of patrician descent, whose parents\r\nhad been married according to the ceremonies of _confarreatio_, were\r\nnominated by the Comitia, one of whom was selected (_captus_), and\r\nconsecrated (_inaugurabatur_) by the pontifex maximus. From that\r\ntime forward he was emancipated from the control of his father, and\r\nbecame sui juris. He alone of all priests wore the _albogalerus_;\r\nhe had a right to a _lictor_, to the _toga praetexta_, the _sella\r\ncurulis_, and to a seat in the senate in virtue of his office. If\r\none in bonds took refuge in his house, his chains were immediately\r\nstruck off. To counterbalance these high honours, the dialis was\r\nsubjected to a multitude of restrictions. It was unlawful for him\r\nto be out of the city for a single night; and he was forbidden to\r\nsleep out of his own bed for three nights consecutively. He might not\r\nmount upon horseback, nor even touch a horse, nor look upon an army\r\nmarshalled without the pomoerium, and hence was seldom elected to the\r\nconsulship. The object of the above rules was manifestly to make him\r\nliterally _Jovi adsiduum sacerdotem_; to compel constant attention\r\nto the duties of the priesthood. _Flaminica_ was the name given to\r\nthe wife of the dialis. He was required to wed a virgin according\r\nto the ceremonies of _confarreatio_, which regulation also applied\r\nto the two other flamines majores; and he could not marry a second\r\ntime. Hence, since her assistance was essential in the performance\r\nof certain ordinances, a divorce was not permitted, and if she died,\r\nthe dialis was obliged to resign. The municipal towns also had their\r\nflamens. Thus the celebrated affray between Milo and Clodius took\r\nplace while the former was on his way to Lanuvium, of which he was\r\nthen dictator, to declare the election of a flamen (_ad flaminem\r\nprodendum_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAMMEUM. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFLŌRĀLĬA, or Florales Ludi, a festival which was celebrated at Rome\r\nin honour of Flora or Chloris, during five days, beginning on the\r\n28th of April and ending on the 2nd of May. It was said to have been\r\ninstituted at Rome in 238 B.C., at the command of an oracle in the\r\nSibylline books, for the purpose of obtaining from the goddess the\r\nprotection of the blossoms. The celebration was, as usual, conducted\r\nby the aediles, and was carried on with excessive merriment,\r\ndrinking, and lascivious games.\r\n\r\n\r\nFŌCĀLĔ, a covering for the ears and neck, made of wool, and worn by\r\ninfirm, and delicate persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFŎCUS, _dim._ FOCŬLUS (ἑστία, ἐσχάρα, ἐσχαρίς), a fire-place; a\r\nhearth; a brazier. The fire-place possessed a sacred character, and\r\nwas dedicated among the Romans to the Lares of each family. Moveable\r\nhearths, or braziers, properly called _foculi_, were frequently used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foculus, Moveable Hearth. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOEDĔRĀTAE CĪVĬTĀTES, FOEDĔRĀTI, SŎCĬI. In the seventh century of\r\nRome these names expressed those Italian states which were connected\r\nwith Rome by a treaty (_foedus_). These names did not include Roman\r\ncolonies or Latin colonies, or any place which had obtained the Roman\r\ncivitas or citizenship. Among the _foederati_ were the _Latini_, who\r\nwere the most nearly related to the Romans, and were designated by\r\nthis distinctive name; the rest of the foederati were comprised under\r\nthe collective name of _Socii_ or _Foederati_. They were independent\r\nstates, yet under a general liability to furnish a contingent to the\r\nRoman army. Thus they contributed to increase the power of Rome, but\r\nthey had not the privileges of Roman citizens. The discontent among\r\nthe foederati, and their claims to be admitted to the privileges\r\nof Roman citizens, led to the Social War. The Julia Lex (B.C. 90)\r\ngave the civitas to the Socii and Latini; and a lex of the following\r\nyear contained, among other provisions, one for the admission to the\r\nRoman civitas of those peregrini who were entered on the lists of the\r\ncitizens of federate states, and who complied with the provisions of\r\nthe lex. [CIVITAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOENUS. [FENUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Folles, Bellows. (From a Roman Lamp.)]\r\n\r\nFOLLIS--(1) An inflated ball of leather, which boys and old men among\r\nthe Romans threw from one to another as a gentle exercise of the\r\nbody.--(2) A leather purse or bag.--(3) A pair of bellows, consisting\r\nof two inflated skins, and having valves adjusted to the natural\r\napertures at one part for admitting the air, and a pipe inserted into\r\nanother part for its emission.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fountain of Peirene at Corinth.]\r\n\r\nFONS (κρήνη), a spring of water, and also an artificial fountain,\r\nmade either by covering and decorating a spring with buildings and\r\nsculpture, or by making a jet or stream of water, supplied by an\r\nelevated cistern, play into an artificial basin. Such fountains\r\nserved the double purpose of use and ornament. They were covered\r\nto keep them pure and cool, and the covering was frequently in the\r\nform of a monopteral temple: there were also statues, the subjects\r\nof which were suggested by the circumstance that every fountain was\r\nsacred to some divinity, or they were taken from the whole range of\r\nmythological legends. A very large proportion of the immense supply\r\nof water brought to Rome by the aqueducts was devoted to the public\r\nfountains, which were divided into two classes; namely, _lacus_,\r\nponds or reservoirs, and _salientes_, jets of water, besides which\r\nmany of the castella were so constructed as to be also fountains.\r\nThere were also many small private fountains in the houses and villas\r\nof the wealthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fountain. (From a Painting at Pompeii.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFŎRES. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFORNĀCĀLĬA, a festival in honour of Fornax, the goddess of furnaces,\r\nin order that the corn might be properly baked. This ancient festival\r\nis said to have been instituted by Numa. The time for its celebration\r\nwas proclaimed every year by the curio maximus, who announced in\r\ntablets, which were placed in the forum, the different part which\r\neach curia had to take in the celebration of the festival. Those\r\npersons who did not know to what curia they belonged performed the\r\nsacred rites on the _Quirinalia_, called from this circumstance the\r\n_Stultorum feriae_, which fell on the last day of the Fornacalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORNIX, in its primary sense, is synonymous with ARCUS, but more\r\ncommonly implies an arched vault, constituting both roof and ceiling\r\nto the apartment which it encloses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFŎRUM. [See CLASSICAL DICT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRĂMĔA. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRĀTRES ARVĀLES. [ARVALES FRATRES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRĒNUM (χαλινός), a bridle. That Bellerophon might be enabled to\r\nperform the exploits required of him by the king of Lycia, he was\r\npresented by Athena with a bridle as the means of subduing the winged\r\nhorse Pegasus, who submitted to receive it whilst he was slaking\r\nhis thirst at the fountain Peirene. Such was the Grecian account\r\nof the invention of the bridle, and in reference to it Athena was\r\nworshipped at Corinth, under the titles Ἵππια and Χαλινῖτις. The bit\r\n(_orea_, δῆγμα, στόμιον), was commonly made of several pieces, and\r\nflexible, so as not to hurt the horse’s mouth; although there was\r\nlikewise a bit which was armed with protuberances resembling wolves’\r\nteeth, and therefore called _lupatum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pegasus receiving the Bridle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRĪGĬDĀRĬUM. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRĬTILLUS (φιμός), a dice-box of a cylindrical form, and therefore\r\ncalled also _turricula_, or _pyrgus_, and formed with parallel\r\nindentations (_gradus_) on the inside, so as to make a rattling noise\r\nwhen the dice were shaken in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRŪMENTĀRĬAE LEGES. The supply of corn at Rome was considered\r\none of the duties of the government. The superintendence of the\r\ncorn-market belonged in ordinary times to the aediles, but when\r\ngreat scarcity prevailed, an extraordinary officer was appointed\r\nfor the purpose under the title of _Praefectus Annonae_. Even in\r\nearly times it had been usual for the state on certain occasions,\r\nand for wealthy individuals, to make occasional donations of corn to\r\nthe people (_donatio_, _largitio_, _divisio_; subsequently called\r\n_frumentatio_). But such donations were only casual; and it was not\r\ntill B.C. 123, that the first legal provision was made for supplying\r\nthe poor at Rome with corn at a price much below its market value.\r\nIn that year C. Sempronius Gracchus brought forward the first _Lex\r\nFrumentaria_, by which each citizen was entitled to receive every\r\nmonth a certain quantity of wheat (_triticum_) at the price of 6⅓\r\nasses for the modius, which was equal to 1 gallon and nearly 8 pints\r\nEnglish. This was only a trifle more than half the market price. Each\r\nperson probably received five modii monthly, as in later times. About\r\nB.C. 91, the tribune M. Octavius brought forward the _Lex Octavia_,\r\nwhich modified the law of Gracchus to some extent, so that the public\r\ntreasury did not suffer so much. Sulla went still further, and by his\r\n_Lex Cornelia_, B.C. 82, did away altogether with these distributions\r\nof corn; but in B.C. 73, the Lex Sempronia was renewed by the _Lex\r\nTerentia Cassia_, which enacted that each Roman citizen should\r\nreceive 5 modii a month at the price of 6⅓ asses for each modius. The\r\nLeges Frumentariae had _sold_ corn to the people; but by the _Lex\r\nClodia_ of the tribune Clodius, B.C. 58, the corn was distributed\r\nwithout any payment; the abolition of the payment cost the state a\r\nfifth part of its revenues. When Caesar became master of the Roman\r\nworld, he resolved to remedy the evils attending the system, so\r\nfar as he was able. He did not venture to abolish altogether these\r\ndistributions of corn, but he did the next best thing in his power,\r\nwhich was reducing the number of the recipients. During the civil\r\nwars numbers of persons, who had no claim to the Roman franchise,\r\nhad settled at Rome in order to obtain a share in the distributions.\r\nCaesar excluded from this privilege every person who could not prove\r\nthat he was a Roman citizen; and thus the 320,000 persons, who had\r\npreviously received the corn, were at once reduced to 150,000. The\r\nuseful regulations of Caesar fell into neglect after his death; and\r\nin B.C. 5, the number of recipients had amounted to 320,000. But\r\nin B.C. 2, Augustus reduced the number of recipients to 200,000,\r\nand renewed many of Caesar’s regulations. The chief of them seem to\r\nhave been: 1. That every citizen should receive monthly a certain\r\nquantity of corn (probably 5 modii) on the payment of a certain\r\nsmall sum. Occasionally, in seasons of scarcity, or in order to\r\nconfer a particular favour, Augustus made these distributions quite\r\ngratuitous; they then became _congiaria_. [CONGIARIUM.] 2. That those\r\nwho were completely indigent should receive the corn gratuitously,\r\nand should be furnished for the purpose with _tesserae nummariae_\r\nor _frumentariae_, which entitled them to the corn without payment.\r\nThe system which had been established by Augustus, was followed by\r\nhis successors; but as it was always one of the first maxims of the\r\nstate policy of the Roman emperors to prevent any disturbance in the\r\ncapital, they frequently lowered the price of the public corn, and\r\nalso distributed it gratuitously as a _congiarium_. Hence, the cry\r\nof the populace _panem et circenses_. In course of time, the sale\r\nof the corn by the state seems to have ceased altogether, and the\r\ndistribution became altogether gratuitous. Every corn-receiver was\r\ntherefore now provided with a _tessera_, and this tessera, when\r\nonce granted to him, became his property. Hence it came to pass,\r\nthat he was not only allowed to keep the tessera for life, but even\r\nto dispose of it by sale, and bequeath it by will. Every citizen\r\nwas competent to hold a tessera, with the exception of senators.\r\nFurther, as the corn had been originally distributed to the people\r\naccording to the thirty-five tribes into which they were divided, the\r\ncorn-receivers in each tribe formed a kind of corporation, which came\r\neventually to be looked upon as the tribe, when the tribes had lost\r\nall political significance. Hence, the purchase of a tessera became\r\nequivalent to the purchase of a place in a tribe; and, accordingly,\r\nwe find in the Digest the expressions _emere tribum_ and _emere\r\ntesseram_ used as synonymous. Another change was also introduced at a\r\nlater period, which rendered the bounty still more acceptable to the\r\npeople. Instead of distributing the corn every month, wheaten bread,\r\ncalled _annona civica_, was given to the people. It is uncertain at\r\nwhat time this change was introduced, but it seems to have been the\r\ncustom before the reign of Aurelian (A.D. 270-275).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRŪMENTĀRĬI, officers under the Roman empire, who acted as spies\r\nin the provinces, and reported to the emperors anything which\r\nthey considered of importance. They appear to have been called\r\n_Frumentarii_ because it was their duty to collect information in the\r\nsame way as it was the duty of other officers, called by the same\r\nname, to collect corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nFŪCUS (φῦκος), the paint which the Greek and Roman ladies employed\r\nin painting their cheeks, eye-brows, and other parts of their\r\nfaces. The practice of painting the face was very general among\r\nthe Greek ladies, and probably came into fashion in consequence\r\nof their sedentary mode of life, which robbed their complexions\r\nof their natural freshness, and induced them to have recourse to\r\nartificial means for restoring the red and white of nature. The\r\neye-brows and eye-lids were stained black with στίμμι or στίμμις,\r\na sulphuret of antimony, which is still employed by the Turkish\r\nladies for the same purpose. The eye-brows were likewise stained\r\nwith ἄσβολος, a preparation of soot. Among the Romans the art of\r\npainting the complexion was carried to a still greater extent than\r\namong the Greeks, and even Ovid did not disdain to write a poem on\r\nthe subject, which he calls (_de Art. Am._ iii. 206) “parvus, sed\r\ncura grande, libellus, opus;” though the genuineness of the fragment\r\nof the _Medicamina faciei_, ascribed to this poet, is doubtful.\r\nThe Roman ladies even went so far as to paint with blue the veins\r\non the temples. The ridiculous use of patches (_splenia_), which\r\nwere common among the English ladies in the reign of Queen Anne and\r\nthe first Georges, was not unknown to the Roman ladies. The more\r\neffeminate of the male sex at Rome, and likewise in Greece, also\r\nemployed paint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girl painting herself. (From a Gem.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFŬGA LĀTA.

The fullones not only received the cloth\r\nas it came from the loom in order to scour and smooth it, but also\r\nwashed and cleansed garments which had been already worn. The clothes\r\nwere first washed, which was done in tubs or vats, where they were\r\ntrodden upon and stamped by the feet of the fullones, whence Seneca\r\nspeaks of _saltus fullonicus_. The ancients were not acquainted with\r\nsoap, but they used in its stead different kinds of alkali, by which\r\nthe dirt was more easily separated from the clothes. Of these, by far\r\nthe most common was the urine of men and animals, which was mixed\r\nwith the water in which the clothes were washed. When the clothes\r\nwere dry, the wool was brushed and carded to raise the nap, sometimes\r\nwith the skin of a hedgehog, and sometimes with some plants of the\r\nthistle kind. The clothes were then hung on a vessel of basket-work\r\n(_viminea cavea_), under which sulphur was placed in order to whiten\r\nthe cloth. A fine white earth, called Cimolian by Pliny, was often\r\nrubbed into the cloth to increase its whiteness. The establishment\r\nor workshop of the fullers was called _Fullonica_, _Fullonicum_, or\r\n_Fullonimn_. The Greeks were also accustomed to send their garments\r\nto fullers to be washed and scoured. The word πλύνειν denoted the\r\nwashing of linen, and κναφεύειν or γναφεύειν the washing of woollen\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFŪNAMBŬLUS (καλοβάτης σχοινοβάτης), a rope-dancer. The art of\r\ndancing on the tight-rope was carried to as great perfection among\r\nthe Romans as it is with us. The performers placed themselves in an\r\nendless variety of graceful and sportive attitudes, and represented\r\nthe characters of bacchanals, satyrs, and other imaginary beings.\r\nOne of the most difficult exploits was running down the rope at the\r\nconclusion of the performance. It was a strange attempt of Germanicus\r\nand of the emperor Galba to exhibit elephants walking on the rope.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDA (σφενδόνη), a sling. Slingers are not mentioned in the Iliad;\r\nbut the light troops of the Greek and Roman armies consisted in great\r\npart of slingers (_funditores_, σφενδονήται). The most celebrated\r\nslingers were the inhabitants of the Balearic islands. Besides\r\nstones, plummets, called _glandes_ (μολυβδίδες), of a form between\r\nacorns and almonds, were cast in moulds to be thrown with slings.\r\nThe manner in which the sling was wielded may be seen in the annexed\r\nfigure of a soldier with a provision of stones in the sinus of his\r\npallium, and with his arm extended in order to whirl the sling about\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Funda, Sling.

(Stackelberg, ‘Die Gräber der Hellenen,’ pl.\r\n7, 8.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tomb in Lycia.]\r\n\r\nFŪNUS, a funeral.--(1) GREEK. The Greeks attached great importance\r\nto the burial of the dead. They believed that souls could not enter\r\nthe Elysian fields till their bodies had been buried; and so strong\r\nwas this feeling among the Greeks, that it was considered a religious\r\nduty to throw earth upon a dead body, which a person might happen\r\nto find unburied; and among the Athenians, those children who\r\nwere released from all other obligations to unworthy parents, were\r\nnevertheless bound to bury them by one of Solon’s laws. The neglect\r\nof burying one’s relatives is frequently mentioned by the orators\r\nas a grave charge against the moral character of a man; in fact,\r\nthe burial of the body by the relations of the dead was considered\r\none of the most sacred duties by the universal law of the Greeks.\r\nSophocles represents Antigone as disregarding all consequences in\r\norder to bury the dead body of her brother Polyneices, which Creon,\r\nthe king of Thebes, had commanded to be left unburied. The common\r\nexpressions for the funeral rites, τὰ δίκαια, νόμιμα or νομιζόμενα,\r\nπροσήκοντα, show that the dead had, as it were, a legal and moral\r\nclaim to burial. After a person was dead, it was the custom first to\r\nplace in his mouth an obolus, called _danace_ (δανάκη), with which\r\nhe might pay the ferryman in Hades. The body was then washed and\r\nanointed with perfumed oil, the head was crowned with the flowers\r\nwhich happened to be in season, and the body dressed in as handsome\r\na robe as the family could afford. These duties were not performed\r\nby hired persons, like the _pollinctores_ among the Romans, but by\r\nthe women of the family, upon whom the care of the corpse always\r\ndevolved. The corpse was then laid out (πρόθεσις, προτίθεσθαι) on a\r\nbed, which appears to have been of the ordinary kind, with a pillow\r\nfor supporting the head and back. By the side of the bed there\r\nwere placed painted earthen vessels, called λήκυθοι, which were\r\nalso buried with the corpse. Great numbers of these painted vases\r\nhave been found in modern times; and they have been of great use\r\nin explaining many matters connected with antiquity. A honey-cake,\r\ncalled μελιττοῦτα, which appears to have been intended for Cerberus,\r\nwas also placed by the side of the corpse. Before the door a vessel\r\nof water was placed, called ὄστρακον, ἀρδάλιον or ἀρδάνιον, in order\r\nthat persons who had been in the house might purify themselves by\r\nsprinkling water on their persons. The relatives stood around the\r\nbed, the women uttering great lamentations, rending their garments,\r\nand tearing their hair. On the day after the πρόθεσις, or the third\r\nday after death, the corpse was carried out (ἐκφορά, ἐκκομιδή)\r\nfor burial, early in the morning and before sunrise. A burial soon\r\nafter death was supposed to be pleasing to the dead. In some places\r\nit appears to have been usual to bury the dead on the day following\r\ndeath. The men walked before the corpse, and the women behind.\r\nThe funeral procession was preceded or followed by hired mourners\r\n(θρηνῳδοί), who appear to have been usually Carian women, playing\r\nmournful tunes on the flute. The body was either buried or burnt. The\r\nword θάπτειν is used in connection with either mode; it is applied to\r\nthe collection of the ashes after burning, and accordingly we find\r\nthe words καίειν and θάπτειν used together. The proper expression\r\nfor interment in the earth is κατορύττειν. In Homer the bodies of\r\nthe dead are burnt; but interment was also used in very ancient\r\ntimes. Cicero says that the dead were buried at Athens in the time\r\nof Cecrops; and we also read of the bones of Orestes being found in\r\na coffin at Tegea. The dead were commonly buried among the Spartans\r\nand the Sicyonians, and the prevalence of this practice is proved\r\nby the great number of skeletons found in coffins in modern times,\r\nwhich have evidently not been exposed to the action of fire. Both\r\nburning and burying appear to have been always used to a greater or\r\nless extent at different periods; till the spread of Christianity\r\nat length put an end to the former practice. The dead bodies were\r\nusually burnt on piles of wood, called _pyres_ (πυραί). The body\r\nwas placed on the top; and in the heroic times it was customary to\r\nburn with the corpse animals and even captives or slaves. Oils and\r\nperfumes were also thrown into the flames. When the pyre was burnt\r\ndown, the remains of the fire were quenched with wine, and the\r\nrelatives and friends collected the bones. The bones were then washed\r\nwith wine and oil, and placed in urns, which were sometimes made of\r\ngold. The corpses which were not burnt were buried in coffins, which\r\nwere called by various names, as σοροί, πύελοι, ληνοί, λάρνακες,\r\nδροῖται, though some of these names are also applied to the urns in\r\nwhich the bones were collected. They were made of various materials,\r\nbut were usually of baked clay or earthenware. The following woodcut\r\ncontains two of the most ancient kind; the figure in the middle is\r\nthe section of one. The dead were usually buried outside the town,\r\nas it was thought that their presence in the city brought pollution\r\nto the living. At Athens none were allowed to be buried within the\r\ncity; but Lycurgus, in order to remove all superstition respecting\r\nthe presence of the dead, allowed of burial in Sparta. Persons who\r\npossessed lands in Attica were frequently buried in them, and we\r\ntherefore read of tombs in the fields. Tombs, however, were most\r\nfrequently built by the side of roads, and near the gates of the\r\ncity. At Athens, the most common place of burial was outside of the\r\nItonian gate, near the road leading to the Peiraeeus, which gate\r\nwas for that reason called the burial gate. Those who had fallen in\r\nbattle were buried at the public expense in the outer Cerameicus, on\r\nthe road leading to the Academia. Tombs were called θῆκαι, τάφοι,\r\nμνήματα, μνημεῖα, σήματα. Many of these were only mounds of earth\r\nor stones (χώματα, κολῶναι τύμβοι). Others were built of stone,\r\nand frequently ornamented with great taste. Some Greek tombs were\r\nbuilt under ground, and called _hypogea_ (ὑπόγαια or ὑπόγεια). They\r\ncorrespond to the Roman _conditoria_. The monuments erected over the\r\ngraves of persons were usually of four kinds: 1. στῆλαι, pillars\r\nor upright stone tablets; 2. κίονες, columns; 3. ναΐδια or ἡρῷα,\r\nsmall buildings in the form of temples; and 4. τράπεζαι, flat square\r\nstones, called by Cicero _mensae_. The term στῆλαι is sometimes\r\napplied to all kinds of funeral monuments, but properly designates\r\nupright stone tablets, which were usually terminated with an oval\r\nheading, called ἐπίθημα. The epithema was frequently ornamented with\r\na kind of arabesque work, as in the preceding specimen. The κίονες,\r\nor columns, were of various forms, as is shown by the two specimens\r\nin the annexed cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Epithema or Heading of Tombstone. (Stackelberg, pl.\r\n3.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sepulchral Columns. (Paintings on Vases.)]\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions upon these funeral monuments usually contain\r\nthe name of the deceased person, and that of the demus to which\r\nhe belonged, as well as frequently some account of his life. The\r\nfollowing example of an ἡρῷον will give a general idea of monuments\r\nof this kind.--Orations in praise of the dead were sometimes\r\npronounced; but Solon ordained that such orations should be confined\r\nto persons who were honoured with a public funeral. In the heroic\r\nages games were celebrated at the funeral of a great man, as in\r\nthe case of Patroclus; but this practice does not seem to have been\r\nusual in the historical times.--All persons who had been engaged in\r\nfunerals were considered polluted, and could not enter the temples\r\nof the gods till they had been purified. After the funeral was over,\r\nthe relatives partook of a feast, which was called περίδειπνον or\r\nνεκρόδειπνον. This feast was always given at the house of the nearest\r\nrelative of the deceased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sepulchral Heroon. (Painting on Vase.)]\r\n\r\nThus the relatives of those who had fallen at the battle of\r\nChaeroneia partook of the περίδειπνον at the house of Demosthenes,\r\nas if he were the nearest relative to them all. On the second day\r\nafter the funeral a sacrifice to the dead was offered, called τρίτα;\r\nbut the principal sacrifice to the dead was on the ninth day, called\r\nἔννατα or ἔνατα. The mourning for the dead appears to have lasted\r\ntill the thirtieth day after the funeral, on which day sacrifices\r\nwere again offered. At Sparta the time of mourning was limited to\r\neleven days. During the time of mourning it was considered indecorous\r\nfor the relatives of the deceased to appear in public; they were\r\naccustomed to wear a black dress, and in ancient times they cut\r\noff their hair as a sign of grief.--The tombs were preserved by\r\nthe family to which they belonged with the greatest care, and were\r\nregarded as among the strongest ties which attached a man to his\r\nnative land. In the Docimasia of the Athenian archons it was always\r\na subject of inquiry whether they had kept in proper repair the\r\ntombs of their ancestors. On certain days the tombs were crowned\r\nwith flowers, and offerings were made to the dead, consisting of\r\ngarlands of flowers and various other things. The act of offering\r\nthese presents was called ἐναγίζειν, and the offerings themselves\r\nἐναγίσματα, or more commonly χοαί. The γενέσια mentioned by Herodotus\r\nappear to have consisted in offerings of the same kind, which were\r\npresented on the anniversary of the birth-day of the deceased. The\r\nνεκύσια were probably offerings on the anniversary of the day of\r\nthe death; though, according to some writers, the νεκύσια were the\r\nsame as the γενέσια. Certain criminals, who were put to death by\r\nthe state, were also deprived of the rights of burial, which was\r\nconsidered as an additional punishment. There were certain places,\r\nboth at Athens and Sparta, where the dead bodies of such criminals\r\nwere cast. A person who had committed suicide was not deprived of\r\nburial, but the hand with which he had killed himself was cut off\r\nand buried by itself.--(2) ROMAN. When a Roman was at the point of\r\ndeath, his nearest relation present endeavoured to catch the last\r\nbreath with his mouth. The ring was taken off the finger of the\r\ndying person; and as soon as he was dead his eyes and mouth were\r\nclosed by the nearest relation, who called upon the deceased by\r\nname, exclaiming _have_ or _vale_. The corpse was then washed, and\r\nanointed with oil and perfumes, by slaves, called _pollinctores_,\r\nwho belonged to the _libitinarii_, or undertakers. The libitinarii\r\nappear to have been so called because they dwelt near the temple\r\nof Venus Libitina, where all things requisite for funerals were\r\nsold. Hence we find the expressions _vitare Libitinam_ and _evadere\r\nLibitinam_ used in the sense of escaping death. At this temple an\r\naccount (_ratio, ephemeris_) was kept of those who died, and a small\r\nsum was paid for the registration of their names. A small coin was\r\nthen placed in the mouth of the corpse, in order to pay the ferryman\r\nin Hades, and the body was laid out on a couch in the vestibule of\r\nthe house, with its feet towards the door, and dressed in the best\r\nrobe which the deceased had worn when alive. Ordinary citizens were\r\ndressed in a white toga, and magistrates in their official robes.\r\nIf the deceased had received a crown while alive as a reward for\r\nhis bravery, it was now placed on his head; and the couch on which\r\nhe was laid was sometimes covered with leaves and flowers. A branch\r\nof cypress was also usually placed at the door of the house, if he\r\nwas a person of consequence. Funerals were usually called _funera\r\njusta_ or _exsequiae_; the latter term was generally applied to\r\nthe funeral procession (_pompa funebris_). There were two kinds\r\nof funerals, public and private; of which the former was called\r\n_funus publicum_ or _indictivum_, because the people were invited\r\nto it by a herald; the latter _funus tacitum_, _translatitium_, or\r\n_plebeium_. A person appears to have usually left a certain sum of\r\nmoney in his will to pay the expenses of his funeral; but if he did\r\nnot do so, nor appoint any one to bury him, this duty devolved upon\r\nthe persons to whom the property was left, and if he died without a\r\nwill, upon his relations, according to their order of succession to\r\nthe property. The expenses of the funeral were in such cases decided\r\nby an arbiter, according to the property and rank of the deceased,\r\nwhence _arbitria_ is used to signify the funeral expenses.--The\r\nfollowing description of the mode in which a funeral was conducted\r\nonly applies strictly to the funerals of the great; the same pomp and\r\nceremony could not of course be observed in the case of persons in\r\nordinary circumstances. All funerals in ancient times were performed\r\nat night, but afterwards the poor only were buried at night, because\r\nthey could not afford to have any funeral procession. The corpse was\r\nusually carried out of the house (_efferebatur_) on the eighth day\r\nafter the death. The order of the funeral procession was regulated\r\nby a person called _designator_ or _dominus funeris_, who was\r\nattended by lictors dressed in black. It was headed by musicians\r\nof various kinds (_cornicines, siticines_), who played mournful\r\nstrains, and next came mourning women, called _praeficae_, who were\r\nhired to lament and sing the funeral song (_naenia_ or _lessus_) in\r\npraise of the deceased. These were sometimes followed by players and\r\nbuffoons (_scurrae, histriones_), of whom one, called _archimimus_,\r\nrepresented the character of the deceased, and imitated his words\r\nand actions. Then came the slaves whom the deceased had liberated,\r\nwearing the cap of liberty (_pileati_); the number of whom was\r\noccasionally very great, since a master sometimes liberated all his\r\nslaves, in his will, in order to add to the pomp of his funeral.\r\nBefore the corpse the images of the deceased and of his ancestors\r\nwere carried, and also the crowns or military rewards which he had\r\ngained. The corpse was carried on a couch (_lectica_), to which the\r\nname of _feretrum_ or _capulum_ was usually given; but the bodies\r\nof poor citizens and of slaves were carried on a common kind of\r\nbier or coffin, called _sandapila_. The _sandapila_ was carried by\r\nbearers, called _vespae_ or _vespillones_, because they carried\r\nout the corpses in the evening (_vespertino tempore_). The couches\r\non which the corpses of the rich were carried were sometimes made\r\nof ivory, and covered with gold and purple. They were often carried\r\non the shoulders of the nearest relations of the deceased, and\r\nsometimes on those of his freedmen. Julius Caesar was carried by\r\nthe magistrates, and Augustus by the senators. The relations of the\r\ndeceased walked behind the corpse in mourning; his sons with their\r\nheads veiled, and his daughters with their heads bare and their hair\r\ndishevelled, contrary to the ordinary practice of both. They often\r\nuttered loud lamentations, and the women beat their breasts and tore\r\ntheir cheeks, though this was forbidden by the Twelve Tables. If the\r\ndeceased was of illustrious rank, the funeral procession went through\r\nthe forum, and stopped before the _rostra_, where a funeral oration\r\n(_laudatio_) in praise of the deceased was delivered. This practice\r\nwas of great antiquity among the Romans, and is said by some writers\r\nto have been first introduced by Publicola, who pronounced a funeral\r\noration in honour of his colleague Brutus. Women also were honoured\r\nby funeral orations. From the Forum the corpse was carried to the\r\nplace of burning or burial, which, according to a law of the Twelve\r\nTables, was obliged to be outside the city. The Romans in the most\r\nancient times buried their dead, though they also early adopted, to\r\nsome extent, the custom of burning, which is mentioned in the Twelve\r\nTables. Burning, however, does not appear to have become general\r\ntill the later times of the republic. Marius was buried, and Sulla\r\nwas the first of the Cornelian gens whose body was burned. Under the\r\nempire burning was almost universally practised, but was gradually\r\ndiscontinued as Christianity spread, so that it had fallen into\r\ndisuse in the fourth century. Persons struck by lightning were not\r\nburnt, but buried on the spot, which was called _Bidental_, and was\r\nconsidered sacred. [BIDENTAL.] Children also, who had not cut their\r\nteeth, were not burnt, but buried in a place called _Suggrundarium_.\r\nThose who were buried were placed in a coffin (_arca_ or _loculus_),\r\nwhich was frequently made of stone, and sometimes of the Assian\r\nstone, which came from Assos in Troas, and which consumed all the\r\nbody, with the exception of the teeth, in 40 days, whence it was\r\ncalled _sarcophagus_. This name was in course of time applied to\r\nany kind of coffin or tomb. The corpse was burnt on a pile of wood\r\n(_pyra_ or _rogus_). This pile was built in the form of an altar,\r\nwith four equal sides, whence we find it called _ara sepulcri_ and\r\n_funeris ara_. The sides of the pile were, according to the Twelve\r\nTables, to be left rough and unpolished, but were frequently covered\r\nwith dark leaves. Cypress trees were sometimes placed before the\r\npile. On the top of the pile the corpse was placed, with the couch on\r\nwhich it had been carried, and the nearest relation then set fire to\r\nthe pile with his face turned away. When the flames began to rise,\r\nvarious perfumes were thrown into the fire, though this practice was\r\nforbidden by the Twelve Tables; cups of oil, ornaments, clothes,\r\ndishes of food, and other things, which were supposed to be agreeable\r\nto the deceased, were also thrown upon the flames. The place where\r\na person was burnt was called _bustum_, if he was afterwards buried\r\non the same spot, and _ustrina_ or _ustrinum_ if he was buried at a\r\ndifferent place. Sometimes animals were slaughtered at the pile, and\r\nin ancient times captives and slaves, since the manes were supposed\r\nto be fond of blood; but afterwards gladiators, called bustuarii,\r\nwere hired to fight round the burning pile. When the pile was burnt\r\ndown, the embers were soaked with wine, and the bones and ashes of\r\nthe deceased were gathered by the nearest relatives, who sprinkled\r\nthem with perfumes, and placed them in a vessel called _urna_, which\r\nwas made of various materials, according to the circumstances of\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sepulchral Urn in British Museum]\r\n\r\nThe urnae were also of various shapes, but most commonly square or\r\nround; and upon them there was usually an inscription or epitaph\r\n(_titulus_ or _epitaphium_), beginning with the letters D. M. S.,\r\nor only D. M., that is, DIS MANIBUS SACRUM, followed by the name of\r\nthe deceased, with the length of his life, &c. The woodcut opposite\r\nis a representation of a sepulchral urn in the British Museum. It\r\nis of an upright rectangular form, richly ornamented with foliage,\r\nand supported at the sides with pilasters. It is to the memory of\r\nCossutia Prima. Its height is 21 inches, and its width at the base 14\r\ninches 6-8ths. Below the inscription an infant genius is represented\r\ndriving a car drawn by four horses.--After the bones and ashes of\r\nthe deceased had been placed in the urn, the persons present were\r\nthrice sprinkled by a priest with pure water from a branch of olive\r\nor laurel for the purpose of purification; after which they were\r\ndismissed by the _praefica_, or some other person, by the solemn\r\nword _Ilicet_, that is, _ire licet_. At their departure they were\r\naccustomed to bid farewell to the deceased by pronouncing the word\r\n_Vale_. The urns were placed in sepulchres, which, as already stated,\r\nwere outside the city, though in a few cases we read of the dead\r\nbeing buried within the city. Thus Valerius Publicola, Tubertus, and\r\nFabricius, were buried in the city; which right their descendants\r\nalso possessed, but did not use. The vestal virgins and the emperors\r\nwere buried in the city.--The verb _sepelire_, like the Greek\r\nθάπτειν, was applied to every mode of disposing of the dead; and\r\n_sepulcrum_ signified any kind of tomb in which the body or bones of\r\na man were placed. The term _humare_ was originally used for burial\r\nin the earth, but was afterwards applied like _sepelire_ to any mode\r\nof disposing of the dead: since it appears to have been the custom,\r\nafter the body was burnt, to throw some earth upon the bones.--The\r\nplaces for burial were either public or private. The public places\r\nof burial were of two kinds; one for illustrious citizens, who were\r\nburied at the public expense, and the other for poor citizens, who\r\ncould not afford to purchase ground for the purpose. The former was\r\nin the Campus Martius, which was ornamented with the tombs of the\r\nillustrious dead, and in the Campus Esquilinus; the latter was also\r\nin the Campus Esquilinus, and consisted of small pits or caverns,\r\ncalled _puticuli_ or _puticulae_; but as this place rendered the\r\nneighbourhood unhealthy, it was given to Maecenas, who converted it\r\ninto gardens, and built a magnificent house upon it. Private places\r\nfor burial were usually by the sides of the roads leading to Rome;\r\nand on some of these roads, such as the Via Appia, the tombs formed\r\nan almost uninterrupted street for many miles from the gates of\r\nthe city. They were frequently built by individuals during their\r\nlifetime; thus Augustus, in his sixth consulship, built the Mausoleum\r\nfor his sepulchre between the Via Flaminia and the Tiber, and planted\r\nround it woods and walks for public use. The heirs were often ordered\r\nby the will of the deceased to build a tomb for him; and they\r\nsometimes did it at their own expense.--Sepulchres were originally\r\ncalled _busta_, but this word was afterwards employed in the manner\r\nmentioned under Bustum. Sepulchres were also frequently called\r\n_monumenta_, but this term was also applied to a monument erected to\r\nthe memory of a person in a different place from that where he was\r\nburied. _Conditoria_ or _conditiva_ were sepulchres under ground,\r\nin which dead bodies were placed entire, in contradistinction to\r\nthose sepulchres which contained the bones and ashes only.--The\r\ntombs of the rich were commonly built of marble, and the ground\r\nenclosed with an iron railing or wall, and planted round with trees.\r\nThe extent of the burying-ground was marked by cippi [CIPPUS]. The\r\nname of mausoleum, which was originally the name of the magnificent\r\nsepulchre erected by Artemisia to the memory of Mausolus, king of\r\nCaria, was sometimes given to any splendid tomb. The open space\r\nbefore a sepulchre was called forum, and neither this space nor the\r\nsepulchre itself could become the property of a person by usucapion.\r\nPrivate tombs were either built by an individual for himself and\r\nthe members of his family (_sepulcra familiaria_), or for himself\r\nand his heirs (_sepulcra hereditaria_). A tomb, which was fitted up\r\nwith niches to receive the funeral urns, was called _columbarium_,\r\non account of the resemblance of these niches to the holes of a\r\npigeon-house. In these tombs the ashes of the freedmen and slaves of\r\ngreat families were frequently placed in vessels made of baked clay,\r\ncalled _ollae_, which were let into the thickness of the wall within\r\nthese niches, the lids only being seen, and the inscriptions placed\r\nin front. Tombs were of various sizes and forms, according to the\r\nwealth and taste of the owner. A sepulchre, or any place in which a\r\nperson was buried, was _religiosus_; all things which were left or\r\nbelonged to the Dii Manes were _religiosae_; those consecrated to\r\nthe Dii Superi were called _sacrae_. Even the place in which a slave\r\nwas buried was considered religiosus. Whoever violated a sepulchre\r\nwas subject to an action termed _sepulcri violati actio_. After the\r\nbones had been placed in the urn at the funeral, the friends returned\r\nhome. They then underwent a further purification, called _suffitio_,\r\nwhich consisted in being sprinkled with water and stepping over a\r\nfire. The house itself was also swept with a certain kind of broom;\r\nwhich sweeping or purification was called _exverrae_, and the\r\nperson who did it _everriator_. The _Denicales Feriae_ were also\r\ndays set apart for the purification of the family. The mourning and\r\nsolemnities connected with the dead lasted for nine days after the\r\nfuneral, at the end of which time a sacrifice was performed, called\r\n_novendiale_.--A feast was given in honour of the dead, but it is\r\nuncertain on what day; it sometimes appears to have been given at\r\nthe time of the funeral, sometimes on the novendiale, and sometimes\r\nlater. The name of _silicernium_ was given to this feast. Among the\r\ntombs at Pompeii there is a funeral triclinium for the celebration\r\nof these feasts, which is represented in the annexed woodcut. It is\r\nopen to the sky, and the walls are ornamented by paintings of animals\r\nin the centre of compartments, which have borders of flowers. The\r\ntriclinium is made of stone, with a pedestal in the centre to receive\r\nthe table. After the funeral of great men, there was, in addition to\r\nthe feast for the friends of the deceased, a distribution of raw meat\r\nto the people, called _visceratio_, and sometimes a public banquet.\r\nCombats of gladiators and other games were also frequently exhibited\r\nin honour of the deceased. Thus at the funeral of P. Licinius\r\nCrassus, who had been Pontifex Maximus, raw meat was distributed to\r\nthe people, 120 gladiators fought, and funeral games were celebrated\r\nfor three days, at the end of which a public banquet was given in\r\nthe forum. Public feasts and funeral games were sometimes given on\r\nthe anniversary of funerals. At all banquets in honour of the dead,\r\nthe guests were dressed in white.--The Romans, like the Greeks, were\r\naccustomed to visit the tombs of their relatives at certain periods,\r\nand to offer to them sacrifices and various gifts, which were called\r\n_inferiae_ and _parentalia_. The Romans appear to have regarded the\r\nmanes or departed souls of their ancestors as gods; whence arose\r\nthe practice of presenting to them oblations, which consisted of\r\nvictims, wine, milk, garlands of flowers, and other things. The\r\ntombs were sometimes illuminated on these occasions with lamps. In\r\nthe latter end of the month of February there was a festival, called\r\n_feralia_, in which the Romans were accustomed to carry food to the\r\nsepulchres for the use of the dead. The Romans were accustomed to\r\nwear mourning for their deceased friends, which appears to have been\r\nblack under the republic for both sexes. Under the empire the men\r\ncontinued to wear black in mourning, but the women wore white. They\r\nlaid aside all kinds of ornaments, and did not cut either their hair\r\nor beard. Men appear to have usually worn their mourning for only a\r\nfew days, but women for a year when they lost a husband or parent.\r\nIn a public mourning on account of some signal calamity, as, for\r\ninstance, the loss of a battle, or the death of an emperor, there\r\nwas a total cessation from business, called _justitium_, which was\r\nusually ordained by public appointment. During this period the courts\r\nof justice did not sit, the shops were shut, and the soldiers freed\r\nfrom military duties. In a public mourning the senators did not wear\r\nthe latus clavus and their rings, nor the magistrates their badges of\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Funeral Triclinium at Pompeii. (Mazois, Pomp., 1, pl.\r\nxx.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFURCA, which properly means a fork, was also the name of an\r\ninstrument of punishment. It was a piece of wood in the form of\r\nthe letter Λ, which was placed upon the shoulders of the offender,\r\nwhose hands were tied to it. Slaves were frequently punished in\r\nthis way, and were obliged to carry about the furca wherever they\r\nwent; whence the appellation of _furcifer_ was applied to a man\r\nas a term of reproach. The furca was used in the ancient mode of\r\ncapital punishment among the Romans; the criminal was tied to it, and\r\nthen scourged to death. The _patibulum_ was also an instrument of\r\npunishment, resembling the furca; it appears to have been in the form\r\nof the letter Π. Both the furca and patibulum were also employed as\r\ncrosses, to which criminals appear to have been nailed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURĬŌSUS. [CURATOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFUSCĬNA (τρίαινα), a trident, more commonly called _tridens_, meaning\r\n_tridens stimulus_, because it was originally a three-pronged goad,\r\nused to incite horses to greater swiftness. Neptune was supposed to\r\nbe armed with it when he drove his chariot, and it thus became his\r\nusual attribute, perhaps with an allusion also to the use of the same\r\ninstrument in harpooning fish. It is represented in the cut on p.\r\n84. In the contests of gladiators, the _retiarius_ was armed with a\r\ntrident. [GLADIATORES]\r\n\r\n\r\nFUSTŬĀRĬUM (ξυλοκοπία), was a capital punishment inflicted upon\r\nRoman soldiers for desertion, theft, and similar crimes. It was\r\nadministered in the following manner:--When a soldier was condemned,\r\nthe tribune touched him slightly with a stick, upon which all the\r\nsoldiers of the legion fell upon him with sticks and stones, and\r\ngenerally killed him upon the spot. If, however, he escaped, for he\r\nwas allowed to fly, he could not return to his native country, nor\r\ndid any of his relatives dare to receive him into their houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFŪSUS (ἄτρακτος), the spindle, was always, when in use, accompanied\r\nby the distaff (_colus_, ἠλακάτη), as an indispensable part of the\r\nsame apparatus. The wool, flax, or other material, having been\r\nprepared for spinning, was rolled into a ball (τολύπη, _glomus_),\r\nwhich was, however, sufficiently loose to allow the fibres to be\r\neasily drawn out by the hand of the spinner. The upper part of the\r\ndistaff was then inserted into this mass of flax or wool, and the\r\nlower part was held under the left arm in such a position as was\r\nmost convenient for conducting the operation. The fibres were drawn\r\nout, and at the same time spirally twisted, chiefly by the use of\r\nthe fore-finger and thumb of the right hand; and the thread (_filum,\r\nstamen_, νήμα) so produced was wound upon the spindle until the\r\nquantity was as great as it would carry. The spindle was a stick,\r\n10 or 12 inches long, having at the top a slit or catch (_dens_,\r\nἄγκιστρον) in which the thread was fixed, so that the weight of the\r\nspindle might continually carry down the thread as it was formed. Its\r\nlower extremity was inserted into a small wheel, called the whorl\r\n(_vorticellum_), made of wood, stone, or metal (see woodcut), the\r\nuse of which was to keep the spindle more steady, and to promote its\r\nrotation. The accompanying woodcut shows the operation of spinning,\r\nat the moment when the woman has drawn out a sufficient length of\r\nyarn to twist it by whirling the spindle with her right thumb and\r\nfore-finger, and previously to the act of taking it out of the slit\r\nto wind it upon the bobbin (πήνιον) already formed. It was usual to\r\nhave a basket to hold the distaff and spindle, with the balls of wool\r\nprepared for spinning, and the bobbins already spun. [CALATHUS.]\r\nThe distaff and spindle, with the wool and thread upon them, were\r\ncarried in bridal processions; and, without the wool and thread, they\r\nwere often suspended by females as offerings of religious gratitude,\r\nespecially in old age, or on relinquishing the constant use of them.\r\nThey were most frequently dedicated to Pallas, the patroness of\r\nspinning, and of the arts connected with it. They were exhibited in\r\nthe representations of the three Fates, who were conceived, by their\r\nspinning, to determine the life of every man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fusus, spindle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGĂBINUS CINCTUS. [TOGA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGAESUM (γαισός), a term probably of Celtic origin, denoting a kind\r\nof javelin which was used by the Gauls wherever their ramifications\r\nextended. It was a heavy weapon, the shaft being as thick as a man\r\ncould grasp, and the iron head barbed, and of an extraordinary length\r\ncompared with the shaft.\r\n\r\n\r\nGĂLĔA (κράνος, _poet_. κόρυς, πήληξ), a helmet; a casque. The\r\nhelmet was originally made of skin or leather, whence is supposed\r\nto have arisen its appellation, κυνέη, meaning properly a helmet of\r\ndog-skin, but applied to caps or helmets made of the hide of other\r\nanimals, and even to those which were entirely of bronze or iron.\r\nThe leathern basis of the helmet was also very commonly strengthened\r\nand adorned by the addition of either bronze or gold. Helmets which\r\nhad a metallic basis were in Latin properly called _cassides_,\r\nalthough the terms _galea_ and _cassis_ are often confounded.\r\nThe additions by which the external appearance of the helmet was\r\nvaried, and which served both for ornament and protection, were the\r\nfollowing:--1. Bosses or plates (φάλος), proceeding either from the\r\ntop or the sides, and varying in number from one to four (ἀμφίφαλος,\r\nτετράφαλος). The φάλος was often an emblematical figure, referring\r\nto the character of the wearer. Thus in the colossal statue of\r\nAthena in the Parthenon at Athens, she bore a sphinx on the top of\r\nher helmet, and a griffin on each side. 2. The helmet thus adorned\r\nwas very commonly surmounted by the crest (_crista_, λόφος), which\r\nwas often of horse-hair. 3. The two cheek-pieces (_bucculae_,\r\nπαραγναθίδες), which were attached to the helmet by hinges, so as to\r\nbe lifted up and down. They had buttons or ties at their extremities,\r\nfor fastening the helmet on the head. 4. The beaver, or visor,\r\na peculiar form of which is supposed to have been the αὐλῶπις\r\nτρυφάλεια, _i.e._ the perforated beaver. The gladiators wore helmets\r\nof this kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galeae, helmets. (From ancient Gems,--size of\r\noriginals.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nGĂLĒRUS or GALĒRUM, originally a covering for the head worn by\r\npriests, especially by the _flamen dialis_. It appears to have been a\r\nround cap made of leather, with its top ending in an apex or point.\r\n[APEX.] In course of time the name was applied to any kind of cap\r\nfitting close to the head like a helmet. _Galerus_ and its diminutive\r\n_Galericulum_ are also used to signify a covering for the head made\r\nof hair, and hence a wig.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALLI, the priests of Cybelé, whose worship was introduced at Rome\r\nfrom Phrygia. The Galli were, according to an ancient custom, always\r\ncastrated, and it would seem that, impelled by religious fanaticism,\r\nthey performed this operation on themselves. In their wild,\r\nenthusiastic, and boisterous rites they resembled the Corybantes.\r\nThey seem to have been always chosen from a poor and despised class\r\nof people, for, while no other priests were allowed to beg, the Galli\r\nwere permitted to do so on certain days. The chief priest among them\r\nwas called _archigallus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGĂMĒLĬA (γαμηλία). The demes and phratries of Attica possessed\r\nvarious means to prevent intruders from assuming the rights of\r\ncitizens. Among other regulations, it was ordained that every bride,\r\nprevious to her marriage, should be introduced by her parents or\r\nguardians to the phratria of her husband. This introduction of the\r\nyoung women was accompanied by presents to their new phratores, which\r\nwere called _gamelia_. The women were enrolled in the lists of the\r\nphratries, and this enrolment was also called _gamelia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAUSĂPA, GAUSĂPE, or GAUSĂPUM, a kind of thick cloth, which was on\r\none side very woolly, and was used to cover tables and beds, and by\r\npersons to wrap themselves up after taking a bath, or in general to\r\nprotect themselves against rain and cold. It was worn by men as well\r\nas women. The word gausapa is also sometimes used to designate a\r\nthick wig, such as was made of the hair of Germans, and worn by the\r\nfashionable people at Rome at the time of the emperors.\r\n\r\n\r\nGĔNĔSIA. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGĔNOS (γένος). [TRIBUS, GREEK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENS. According to the traditional accounts of the old Roman\r\nconstitution, the _Gentes_ were subdivisions of the _curiae_, just\r\nas the _curiae_ were subdivisions of the three ancient tribes, the\r\n_Ramnes_, _Titienses_, and _Luceres_. There were ten gentes in\r\neach curia, and consequently one hundred gentes in each tribe, and\r\nthree hundred in the three tribes. Now if there is any truth in\r\nthe tradition of this original distribution of the population into\r\ntribes, curiae, and gentes, it follows that there was no necessary\r\nkinship among those families which belonged to a gens, any more than\r\namong those families which belonged to one curia. The name of the\r\ngens was always characterised by the termination _ia_, as Julia,\r\nCornelia, Valeria; and the gentiles, or members of a gens, all bore\r\nthe name of the gens to which they belonged. As the gentes were\r\nsubdivisions of the three ancient tribes, the populus (in the ancient\r\nsense) alone had gentes, so that to be a patrician and to have a gens\r\nwere synonymous; and thus we find the expressions gens and patricii\r\nconstantly united. Yet it appears that some gentes contained plebeian\r\nfamiliae, which it is conjectured had their origin in marriages\r\nbetween patricians and plebeians before there was connubium between\r\nthem. A hundred new members were added to the senate by the first\r\nTarquin. These were the representatives of the _Luceres_, the third\r\nand inferior tribe; which is indicated by the gentes of this tribe\r\nbeing called _minores_, by way of being distinguished from the older\r\ngentes, _majores_, of the Ramnes and Tities, a distinction which\r\nappears to have been more than nominal. [SENATUS.] There were certain\r\nsacred rites (_sacra gentilitia_) which belonged to a gens, to which\r\nall the members of a gens, as such, were bound. It was the duty of\r\nthe pontifices to look after the due observance of these gentile\r\nsacra, and to see that they were not lost. Each gens seems to have\r\nhad its peculiar place (_sacellum_) for the celebration of these\r\nsacra, which were performed at stated times. By the law of the Twelve\r\nTables the property of a person who died intestate devolved upon the\r\ngens to which he belonged.\r\n\r\n\r\nGĔŌMŎRI. [TRIBUS, GREEK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGĔROUSĬA (γερούσια), or _assembly of elders_, was the aristocratic\r\nelement of the Spartan polity. It was not peculiar to Sparta only,\r\nbut found in other Dorian states, just as a _Boulé_ (βουλή) or\r\ndemocratical council was an element of most Ionian constitutions.\r\nThe _Gerousia_ at Sparta, including the two kings, its presidents,\r\nconsisted of thirty members (γέροντες): a number which seems\r\nconnected with the divisions of the Spartan people. Every Dorian\r\nstate, in fact, was divided into three tribes: the Hylleis, the\r\nDymanes, and the Pamphyli. The tribes at Sparta were again subdivided\r\ninto _obae_ (ὠβαί), which were, like the _Gerontes_, thirty in\r\nnumber, so that each oba was represented by its councillor: any\r\ninference which leads to the conclusion that two obae at least of\r\nthe Hyllean tribe, must have belonged to the royal house of the\r\nHeracleids. No one was eligible to the council till he was sixty\r\nyears of age, and the additional qualifications were strictly of\r\nan aristocratic nature. We are told, for instance, that the office\r\nof a councillor was the reward and prize of virtue, and that it\r\nwas confined to men of distinguished character and station. The\r\nelection was determined by vote, and the mode of conducting it\r\nwas remarkable for its old-fashioned simplicity. The competitors\r\npresented themselves one after another to the assembly of electors;\r\nthe latter testified their esteem by acclamations, which varied\r\nin intensity according to the popularity of the candidates for\r\nwhom they were given. These manifestations of esteem were noted by\r\npersons in an adjoining building, who could judge of the shouting,\r\nbut could not tell in whose favour it was given. The person whom\r\nthese judges thought to have been most applauded was declared the\r\nsuccessful candidate. The office lasted for life. The functions of\r\nthe councillors were partly deliberative, partly judicial, and partly\r\nexecutive. In the discharge of the first, they prepared measures\r\nand passed preliminary decrees, which were to be laid before the\r\npopular assembly, so that the important privilege of initiating all\r\nchanges in the government or laws was vested in them. As a criminal\r\ncourt, they could punish with death and civil degradation (ἀτιμία).\r\nThey also appear to have exercised, like the Areiopagus at Athens,\r\na general superintendence and inspection over the lives and manners\r\nof the citizens, and probably were allowed a kind of patriarchal\r\nauthority, to enforce the observance of ancient usage and discipline.\r\nIt is not, however, easy to define with exactness the original\r\nextent of their functions, especially as respects the last-mentioned\r\nduty, since the ephors not only encroached upon the prerogatives of\r\nthe king and council, but also possessed, in very early times, a\r\ncensorial power, and were not likely to permit any diminution of its\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERRHA (γέῤῥα), in Latin, _Gerrae_, properly signified any thing made\r\nof wicker-work, and was especially used as the name of the Persian\r\nshields, which were made of wicker-work, and were smaller and shorter\r\nthan the Greek shields.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLĂDĬĀTŌRES (μονομάχοι) were men who fought with swords in the\r\namphitheatre and other places, for the amusement of the Roman people.\r\nThey are said to have been first exhibited by the Etrurians, and to\r\nhave had their origin from the custom of killing slaves and captives\r\nat the funeral pyres of the deceased. [BUSTUM; FUNUS.] A show of\r\ngladiators was called munus, and the person who exhibited (_edebat_)\r\nit, _editor_, _munerator_, or _dominus_, who was honoured during the\r\nday of exhibition, if a private person, with the official signs of\r\na magistrate. Gladiators were first exhibited at Rome in B.C. 264,\r\nin the Forum Boarium, by Marcus and Decimus Brutus, at the funeral\r\nof their father. They were at first confined to public funerals, but\r\nafterwards fought at the funerals of most persons of consequence, and\r\neven at those of women. Combats of gladiators were also exhibited at\r\nentertainments, and especially at public festivals by the aediles\r\nand other magistrates, who sometimes exhibited immense numbers, with\r\nthe view of pleasing the people. Under the empire the passion of\r\nthe Romans for this amusement rose to its greatest height, and the\r\nnumber of gladiators who fought on some occasions appears almost\r\nincredible. After Trajan’s triumph over the Dacians, there were more\r\nthan 10,000 exhibited. Gladiators consisted either of captives,\r\nslaves, and condemned malefactors, or of freeborn citizens who fought\r\nvoluntarily. Freemen, who became gladiators for hire, were called\r\n_auctorati_, and their hire _auctoramentum_ or _gladiatorium_. Even\r\nunder the republic, free-born citizens fought as gladiators, but\r\nthey appear to have belonged only to the lower orders. Under the\r\nempire, however, both knights and senators fought in the arena,\r\nand even women.--Gladiators were kept in schools (_ludi_), where\r\nthey were trained by persons called _lanistae_. The whole body of\r\ngladiators under one lanista was frequently called _familia_. They\r\nsometimes were the property of the lanistae, who let them out to\r\npersons who wished to exhibit a show of gladiators; but at other\r\ntimes they belonged to citizens, who kept them for the purpose of\r\nexhibition, and engaged lanistae to instruct them. Thus we read of\r\nthe ludus Aemilius at Rome, and of Caesar’s ludus at Capua. The\r\ngladiators fought in these ludi with wooden swords, called _rudes_.\r\nGreat attention was paid to their diet, in order to increase the\r\nstrength of their bodies.--Gladiators were sometimes exhibited at\r\nthe funeral pyre, and sometimes in the forum, but more frequently in\r\nthe amphitheatre. [AMPHITHEATRUM.]--The person who was to exhibit\r\na show of gladiators, published some days before the exhibition\r\nbills (_libelli_), containing the number and frequently the names\r\nof those who were to fight. When the day came, they were led along\r\nthe arena in procession, and matched by pairs; and their swords\r\nwere examined by the editor to see if they were sufficiently sharp.\r\nAt first there was a kind of sham battle, called _praelusio_, in\r\nwhich they fought with wooden swords, or the like, and afterwards\r\nat the sound of the trumpet the real battle began. When a gladiator\r\nwas wounded, the people called out _habet_ or _hoc habet_; and the\r\none who was vanquished lowered his arms in token of submission.\r\nHis fate, however, depended upon the people, who pressed down\r\ntheir thumbs if they wished him to be saved, but turned them up if\r\nthey wished him to be killed, and ordered him to receive the sword\r\n(_ferrum recipere_), which gladiators usually did with the greatest\r\nfirmness. If the life of a vanquished gladiator was spared, he\r\nobtained his discharge for that day, which was called _missio_;\r\nand hence in an exhibition of gladiators _sine missione_, the\r\nlives of the conquered were never spared. This kind of exhibition,\r\nhowever, was forbidden by Augustus. Palms were usually given to the\r\nvictorious gladiators. Old gladiators, and sometimes those who had\r\nonly fought for a short time, were discharged from the service by\r\nthe editor, at the request of the people, who presented each of them\r\nwith a rudis or wooden sword; whence those who were discharged were\r\ncalled _Rudiarii_.--Gladiators were divided into different classes,\r\naccording to their arms and different mode of fighting, or other\r\ncircumstances. The names of the most important of these classes are\r\ngiven in alphabetical order:--_Andabatae_ wore helmets without any\r\naperture for the eyes, so that they were obliged to fight blindfold,\r\nand thus excited the mirth of the spectators.--_Catervarii_ was the\r\nname given to gladiators when they did not fight in pairs, but when\r\nseveral fought together.--_Essedarii_ fought from chariots, like the\r\nGauls and Britons. [ESSEDA.]--_Hoplomachi_ appear to have been those\r\nwho fought in a complete suit of armour.--_Laqueatores_ were those\r\nwho used a noose to catch their adversaries.--_Meridiani_ were those\r\nwho fought in the middle of the day, after combats with wild beasts\r\nhad taken place in the morning. These gladiators were very slightly\r\narmed.--_Mirmillones_ are said to have been so called from their\r\nhaving the image of a fish (_mormyr_, μορμύρος) on their helmets.\r\nTheir arms were like those of the Gauls, whence we find that they\r\nwere also called Galli. They were usually matched with the Retiarii\r\nor Thracians.--_Provocatores_ fought with the Samnites, but we do\r\nnot know any thing respecting them except their name.--_Retiarii_\r\ncarried only a three-pointed lance, called _tridens_ or _fuscina_\r\n[FUSCINA], and a net (_rete_), which they endeavoured to throw over\r\ntheir adversaries, and they then attacked them with the fuscina while\r\nthey were entangled. The retiarius was dressed in a short tunic,\r\nand wore nothing on his head. If he missed his aim in throwing the\r\nnet, he betook himself to flight, and endeavoured to prepare his net\r\nfor a second cast, while his adversary followed him round the arena\r\nin order to kill him before he could make a second attempt. His\r\nadversary was usually a _secutor_ or a _mirmillo_. In the following\r\nwoodcut a combat is represented between a retiarius and a mirmillo;\r\nthe former has thrown his net over the head of the latter, and is\r\nproceeding to attack him with the fuscina. The lanista stands behind\r\nthe retiarius.--_Samnites_ were so called, because they were armed\r\nin the same way as that people, and were particularly distinguished\r\nby the oblong _scutum_.--_Secutores_ are supposed by some writers to\r\nbe so called because the secutor in his combat with the retiarius\r\npursued the latter when he failed in securing him by his net.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Mirmillo and a Retiarius. (Winckelmann, ‘Monum.\r\nIned.,’ pl. 197.)]\r\n\r\nOther writers think that they were the same as the _supposititii_,\r\nwho were gladiators substituted in the place of those who were\r\nwearied or were killed.--_Thraces_ or _Threces_ were armed, like the\r\nThracians, with a round shield or buckler, and a short sword or\r\ndagger (_sica_). They were usually matched, as already stated, with\r\nthe mirmillones. The following woodcut represents a combat between\r\ntwo Thracians. A lanista stands behind each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thracians. (Winckelmann, l. c.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nGLĂDĬUS (ξίφος, _poet._ ἄορ, φάσγανον), a sword or glaive, by the\r\nLatin poets called _ensis_. The ancient sword had generally a\r\nstraight two-edged blade, rather broad, and nearly of equal width\r\nfrom hilt to point. The Greeks and Romans wore them on the left side,\r\nso as to draw them out of the sheath (_vagina_, κολεός) by passing\r\nthe right hand in front of the body to take hold of the hilt with the\r\nthumb next to the blade. The early Greeks used a very short sword.\r\nIphicrates, who made various improvements in armour about 400 B.C.,\r\ndoubled its length. The Roman sword was larger, heavier, and more\r\nformidable than the Greek.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLANDES. [FUNDA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAECŎSTĂSIS, a place in the Roman forum, on the right of the\r\nComitium, so called because the Greek ambassadors, and perhaps also\r\ndeputies from other foreign or allied states, were allowed to stand\r\nthere to hear the debates. When the sun was seen from the Curia\r\ncoming out between the Rostra and the Graecostasis, it was mid-day;\r\nand an accensus of the consul announced the time with a clear loud\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAMMĂTEUS (γραμματεύς), a clerk or scribe. Among the great number\r\nof scribes employed by the magistrates and government of Athens,\r\nthere were three of a higher rank, who were real state-officers. One\r\nof them was appointed by lot, by the senate, to serve the time of\r\nthe administration of each prytany, though he always belonged to a\r\ndifferent prytany from that which was in power. He was, therefore,\r\ncalled γραμματεὺς κατὰ πρυτανείαν. His province was to keep the\r\npublic records, and the decrees of the people which were made during\r\nthe time of his office, and to deliver to the thesmothetae the\r\ndecrees of the senate.--The second _grammateus_ was elected by the\r\nsenate, by χειροτονία, and was entrusted with the custody of the\r\nlaws. His usual name was γραμματεὺς τῆς βουλῆς.--A third _grammateus_\r\nwas called γραμματεὺς τῆς πόλεως, or γραμματεὺς τῆς βουλῆς καὶ\r\nτοῦ δήμου. He was appointed by the people, by χειροτονία, and the\r\nprincipal part of his office was to read any laws or documents which\r\nwere required to be read in the assembly or in the senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRĂPHĒ (γραφή).

[COENA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Guttus on Coin of L. Plancus.]\r\n\r\nGUTTUS, a vessel with a narrow mouth or neck, from which the liquid\r\nwas poured in drops, whence its name. It was especially used in\r\nsacrifices, and hence we find it represented on the Roman coins\r\nstruck by persons who held any of the priestly offices. The guttus\r\nwas also used for keeping the oil, with which persons were anointed\r\nin the baths. [See p. 56.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gymnasium, after the description of Vitruvius.]\r\n\r\nGYMNĀSIUM (γυμνάσιον). The whole education of a Greek youth was\r\ndivided into three parts,--grammar, music, and gymnastics (γράμματα,\r\nμουσική, γυμναστική), to which Aristotle adds a fourth, the art\r\nof drawing or painting. Gymnastics, however, were thought by the\r\nancients a matter of such importance, that this part of education\r\nalone occupied as much time and attention as all the others put\r\ntogether; and while the latter necessarily ceased at a certain period\r\nof life, gymnastics continued to be cultivated by persons of all\r\nages, though those of an advanced age naturally took lighter and less\r\nfatiguing exercises than boys and youths. The ancients, and more\r\nespecially the Greeks, seem to have been thoroughly convinced that\r\nthe mind could not possibly be in a healthy state, unless the body\r\nwas likewise in perfect health, and no means were thought, either\r\nby philosophers or physicians, to be more conducive to preserve\r\nor restore bodily health than well-regulated exercise. The word\r\ngymnastics is derived from γυμνός (naked), because the persons who\r\nperformed their exercises in public or private gymnasia were either\r\nentirely naked, or merely covered by the short _chiton_. Gymnastic\r\nexercises among the Greeks seem to have been as old as the Greek\r\nnation itself; but they were, as might be supposed, of a rude and\r\nmostly of a warlike character. They were generally held in the open\r\nair, and in plains near a river, which afforded an opportunity for\r\nswimming and bathing. It was about the time of Solon that the Greek\r\ntowns began to build their regular gymnasia as places of exercise for\r\nthe young, with baths, and other conveniences for philosophers and\r\nall persons who sought intellectual amusements. There was probably\r\nno Greek town of any importance which did not possess its gymnasium.\r\nAthens possessed three great gymnasia, the Lyceum (Λύκειον),\r\nCynosarges (Κυνόσαργες), and the Academia (Ἀκαδημία); to which,\r\nin later times, several smaller ones were added. Respecting the\r\nsuperintendence and administration of the gymnasia at Athens, we know\r\nthat Solon in his legislation thought them worthy of great attention;\r\nand the transgression of some of his laws relating to the gymnasia\r\nwas punished with death. His laws mention a magistrate, called the\r\ngymnasiarch (γυμνασίαρχος or γυμνασιάρχης), who was entrusted with\r\nthe whole management of the gymnasia, and with everything connected\r\ntherewith. His office was one of the regular liturgies like the\r\nchoregia and trierarchy, and was attended with considerable expense.\r\nHe had to maintain and pay the persons who were preparing themselves\r\nfor the games and contests in the public festivals, to provide them\r\nwith oil, and perhaps with the wrestlers’ dust. It also devolved upon\r\nhim to adorn the gymnasium, or the place where the agones were held.\r\nThe gymnasiarch was a real magistrate, and invested with a kind of\r\njurisdiction over all those who frequented or were connected with the\r\ngymnasia. Another part of his duties was to conduct the solemn games\r\nat certain great festivals, especially the torch-race (λαμπαδηφορία),\r\nfor which he selected the most distinguished among the ephebi of\r\nthe gymnasia. The number of gymnasiarchs was ten, one from every\r\ntribe. An office of very great importance, in an educational point of\r\nview, was that of the _Sophronistae_ (σωφρονίσται). Their province\r\nwas to inspire the youths with a love of σωφροσύνη, and to protect\r\nthis virtue against all injurious influences. In early times their\r\nnumber at Athens was ten, one from every tribe, with a salary of one\r\ndrachma per day. Their duty not only required them to be present at\r\nall the games of the ephebi, but to watch and correct their conduct\r\nwherever they might meet them, both within and without the gymnasium.\r\nThe instructions in the gymnasia were given by the _Gymnastae_\r\n(γυμνασταί) and the _Paedotribae_ (παιδοτριβαί); at a later period\r\n_Hypopaedotribae_ were added. The Paedotribae were required to\r\npossess a knowledge of all the various exercises which were performed\r\nin the gymnasia; the Gymnastes was the practical teacher, and was\r\nexpected to know the physiological effects and influences on the\r\nconstitution of the youths, and therefore assigned to each of them\r\nthose exercises which he thought most suitable. The anointing of\r\nthe bodies of the youths and strewing them with dust, before they\r\ncommenced their exercises, as well as the regulation of their diet,\r\nwas the duty of the aliptae. [ALIPTAE.]--Among all the different\r\ntribes of the Greeks the exercises which were carried on in a Greek\r\ngymnasium were either mere games, or the more important exercises\r\nwhich the gymnasia had in common with the public contests in the\r\ngreat festivals. Among the former we may mention, 1. The game at ball\r\n(σφαιριστική), which was in universal favour with the Greeks. [PILA.]\r\nEvery gymnasium contained one large room for the purpose of playing\r\nat ball in it (σφαιριστήριον). 2. Παίζειν ἑλκυστίνδα, διελκυστίνδα,\r\nor διὰ γραμμῆς, was a game in which one boy, holding one end of a\r\nrope, tried to pull the boy who held its other end, across a line\r\nmarked between them on the ground. 3. The top (βεμβηξ, βέμβιξ,\r\nῥόμβος, στρόβιλος), which was as common an amusement with Greek boys\r\nas it is with ours. 4. The πεντάλιθος, which was a game with five\r\nstones, which were thrown up from the upper part of the hand and\r\ncaught in the palm. 5. Σκαπέρδα, which was a game in which a rope was\r\ndrawn through the upper part of a tree or a post. Two boys, one on\r\neach side of the post, turning their backs towards one another, took\r\nhold of the ends of the rope and tried to pull each other up. This\r\nsport was also one of the amusements at the Attic Dionysia. The more\r\nimportant games, such as running (δρόμος), throwing of the δίσκος\r\nand the ἄκων, jumping and leaping (ἅλμα, with and without ἁλτῆρες),\r\nwrestling (πάλη), boxing (πυγμή), the pancratium (παγκράτιον),\r\nπένταθλος, λαμπαδηφορία, dancing (ὀρχήσις), &c., are described in\r\nseparate articles. A gymnasium was not a Roman institution. The\r\nregular training of boys in the Greek gymnastics was foreign to Roman\r\nmanners, and even held in contempt. Towards the end of the republic,\r\nmany wealthy Romans who had acquired a taste for Greek manners,\r\nused to attach to their villas small places for bodily exercise,\r\nsometimes called gymnasia, sometimes palaestrae, and to adorn them\r\nwith beautiful works of art. The emperor Nero was the first who built\r\na public gymnasium at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYMNĒSII or GYMNĒTES (γυμνήσιοι, or γυμνῆτες), a class of\r\nbond-slaves at Argos, who may be compared with the Helots at Sparta.\r\nTheir name shows that they attended their masters on military service\r\nin the capacity of light-armed troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYMNŎPAEDĬA (γυμνοπαιδία), the festival of “naked youths,” was\r\ncelebrated at Sparta every year in honour of Apollo Pythaeus,\r\nArtemis, and Leto. The statues of these deities stood in a part of\r\nthe agora called χορός, and it was around these statues that, at the\r\ngymnopaedia, Spartan youths performed their choruses and dances in\r\nhonour of Apollo. The festival lasted for several, perhaps for ten,\r\ndays, and on the last day men also performed choruses and dances in\r\nthe theatre; and during these gymnastic exhibitions they sang the\r\nsongs of Thaletas and Alcman, and the paeans of Dionysodotus. The\r\nleader of the chorus (προστάτης or χοροποιός) wore a kind of chaplet\r\nin commemoration of the victory of the Spartans at Thyrea. This\r\nevent seems to have been closely connected with the gymnopaedia, for\r\nthose Spartans who had fallen on that occasion were always praised\r\nin songs at this festival. The boys in their dances performed such\r\nrhythmical movements as resembled the exercises of the palaestra and\r\nthe pancration, and also imitated the wild gestures of the worship\r\nof Dionysus. The whole season of the gymnopaedia, during which\r\nSparta was visited by great numbers of strangers, was one of great\r\nmerriment and rejoicings, and old bachelors alone seem to have been\r\nexcluded from the festivities. The introduction of the gymnopaedia is\r\ngenerally assigned to the year 665 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nGỸNAECONĪTIS. [DOMUS, GREEK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGỸNAECŎNŎMI or GỸNAECŎCOSMI (γυναικονόμοι or γυναικοκόσμοι),\r\nmagistrates at Athens, originally appointed to superintend the\r\nconduct of Athenian women. Their power was afterwards extended in\r\nsuch a manner that they became a kind of police for the purpose of\r\npreventing any excesses or indecencies, whether committed by men\r\nor by women. Hence they superintended the meetings of friends even\r\nin private houses, for instance, at weddings and on other festive\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHALTĒRES (ἁλτῆρες) were certain masses of stone or metal, which were\r\nused in the gymnastic exercises of the Greeks and Romans. Persons who\r\npractised leaping frequently performed their exercises with halteres\r\nin both hands; but they were also frequently used merely to exercise\r\nthe body in somewhat the same manner as our dumb-bells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Halteres. (Tassie, ‘Catalogue,’ pl. 46.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nHARMĂMAXA (ἁρμάμαξα), a carriage for persons, covered overhead and\r\ninclosed with curtains. It was in general large, often drawn by four\r\nhorses, and attired with splendid ornaments. It occupied among the\r\nPersians the same place which the carpentum did among the Romans,\r\nbeing used, especially upon state occasions, for the conveyance of\r\nwomen and children, of eunuchs, and of the sons of the king with\r\ntheir tutors.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARMOSTAE (ἁρμοσταί, from ἁρμόζω, to fit or join together), the name\r\nof the governors whom the Lacedaemonians, after the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, sent into their subject or conquered towns, partly to keep\r\nthem in submission, and partly to abolish the democratical form of\r\ngovernment, and establish in its stead one similar to their own.\r\nAlthough in many cases they were ostensibly sent for the purpose of\r\nabolishing the tyrannical government of a town, and to restore the\r\npeople to freedom, yet they themselves acted like kings or tyrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flesh-hook. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nHARPĂGO (ἁρπάγη: λύκος: κρεάγρα), a grappling-iron, a drag, a\r\nflesh-hook. In war the grappling-iron, thrown at an enemy’s ship,\r\nseized the rigging, and was then used to drag the ship within reach,\r\nso that it might be easily boarded or destroyed. These instruments\r\nappear to have been much the same as the _manus ferreae_. The\r\nflesh-hook (κρεάγρα) was an instrument used in cookery, resembling a\r\nhand with the fingers bent inwards, used to take boiled meat out of\r\nthe caldron.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARPASTUM. [PILA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHĂRUSPĬCES, or ĂRUSPĬCES (ἱεροσκόποι), soothsayers or diviners,\r\nwho interpreted the will of the gods. They originally came to Rome\r\nfrom Etruria, whence haruspices were often sent for by the Romans\r\non important occasions. The art of the haruspices resembled in many\r\nrespects that of the augurs; but they never acquired that political\r\nimportance which the latter possessed, and were regarded rather\r\nas means for ascertaining the will of the gods than as possessing\r\nany religious authority. They did not in fact form any part of the\r\necclesiastical polity of the Roman state during the republic; they\r\nare never called sacerdotes, they did not form a collegium, and\r\nhad no magister at their head. The art of the haruspices, which\r\nwas called _haruspicina_, consisted in explaining and interpreting\r\nthe will of the gods from the appearance of the entrails (_exta_)\r\nof animals offered in sacrifice, whence they are sometimes called\r\n_extispices_, and their art _extispicium_; and also from lightning,\r\nearthquakes, and all extraordinary phenomena in nature, to which the\r\ngeneral name of _portenta_ was given. Their art is said to have been\r\ninvented by the Etruscan Tages, and was contained in certain books\r\ncalled _libri haruspicini_, _fulgurales_, and _tonitruales_. This\r\nart was considered by the Romans so important at one time, that the\r\nsenate decreed that a certain number of young Etruscans, belonging\r\nto the principal families in the state, should always be instructed\r\nin it. In later times, however, their art fell into disrepute among\r\nwell-educated Romans; and Cicero relates a saying of Cato, that he\r\nwondered that one haruspex did not laugh when he saw another. The\r\nname of haruspex is sometimes applied to any kind of soothsayer or\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hastae, spears.]\r\n\r\nHASTA (ἔγχος), a spear. The spear is defined by Homer, δόρυ χαλκήρες,\r\n“a pole fitted with bronze,” and δόρυ χαλκοβάρες, “a pole heavy with\r\nbronze.” The bronze, for which iron was afterwards substituted,\r\nwas indispensable to form the point (αἰχμή, ἀκωκή, Homer; λόγχη,\r\nXenophon; _acies_, _cuspis_, _spiculum_) of the spear. Each of these\r\ntwo essential parts is often put for the whole, so that a spear is\r\ncalled δόρυ and δοράτιον, αἰχμή, and λόγχη. Even the more especial\r\nterm μελία, meaning an ash-tree, is used in the same manner, because\r\nthe pole of the spear was often the stem of a young ash, stripped\r\nof its bark and polished. The bottom of the spear was often inclosed\r\nin a pointed cap of bronze, called by the Ionic writers σαυρωτῆρ\r\nand οὐρίαχος, and in Attic or common Greek στύραξ. By forcing this\r\ninto the ground the spear was fixed erect. Many of the lancers who\r\naccompanied the king of Persia, had, instead of this spike at the\r\nbottom of their spears, an apple or a pomegranate, either gilt or\r\nsilvered. Fig. 1. in the annexed woodcut shows the top and bottom of\r\na spear, which is held by one of the king’s guards in the sculptures\r\nat Persepolis. The spear was used as a weapon of attack in three\r\ndifferent ways:--1. It was thrown from catapults and other engines\r\n[TORMENTUM]. 2. It was thrust forward as a pike. 3. It was commonly\r\nthrown by the hand. The spear frequently had a leathern thong tied\r\nto the middle of the shaft, which was called ἀγκύλη by the Greeks,\r\nand _amentum_ by the Romans, and which was of assistance in throwing\r\nthe spear. The annexed figure represents the amentum attached to the\r\nspear at the centre of gravity, a little above the middle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hasta with Amentum. (From a Painting on a Vase.)]\r\n\r\nUnder the general terms _hasta_ and ἔγχος were included various\r\nkinds of missiles, of which the principal were as follow:--_Lancea_\r\n(λόγχη), the lance, a comparatively slender spear commonly used by\r\nthe Greek horsemen. The appendage shown in woodcut, Fig. 2, enabled\r\nthem to mount their horses with greater facility.--_Pilum_ (ὑσσός),\r\nthe javelin, much thicker and stronger than the Grecian lance. Its\r\nshaft, often made of cornel, was 4½ feet (three cubits) long, and\r\nthe barbed iron head was of the same length, but this extended half\r\nway down the shaft, to which it was attached with extreme care, so\r\nthat the whole length of the weapon was about 6 feet 9 inches. It\r\nwas used either to throw or to thrust with; it was peculiar to the\r\nRomans, and gave the name of _pilani_ to the division of the army by\r\nwhich it was adopted.--Whilst the heavy-armed Roman soldiers bore the\r\nlong lance and the thick and ponderous javelin, the light-armed used\r\nsmaller missiles, which, though of different kinds, were included\r\nunder the general term _hastae velitares_ (γρόσφοι). The γρόσφος was\r\na dart, with a shaft about three feet long and an inch in thickness:\r\nthe iron head was a span long, and so thin and acuminated as to be\r\nbent by striking against anything, and thus rendered unfit to be\r\nsent back against the enemy. Fig. 3, in the preceding woodcut, shows\r\none which was found in a Roman entrenchment in Gloucestershire.--The\r\nlight infantry of the Roman army used a similar weapon, called _a\r\nspit_ (_veru_, _verutum_; σαύνιον). It was adopted by them from\r\nthe Samnites and the Volsci. Its shaft was 3½ feet long, its point\r\n5 inches. Fig. 4, in the preceding woodcut, represents the head\r\nof a dart in the Royal Collection at Naples; it may be taken as\r\na specimen of the _verutum_, and may be contrasted with fig. 5,\r\nwhich is the head of a lance in the same collection.--The Romans\r\nadopted in like manner the _gaesum_, which was properly a Celtic\r\nweapon; it was given as a reward to any soldier who wounded an\r\nenemy. [GAESUM.]--_Sparus_ is evidently the same word with the\r\nEnglish _spar_ and _spear_. It was the rudest missile of the whole\r\nclass.--Besides the terms _jaculum_ and _spiculum_ (ἄκων, ἀκόντιον),\r\nwhich probably denoted darts, resembling in form the lance and\r\njavelin, but much smaller, adapted consequently to the light-armed\r\n(_jaculatores_), and used in hunting as well as in battle, we find\r\nin classical authors the names of various other spears, which were\r\ncharacteristic of particular nations.--Thus, the _sarissa_ was the\r\nspear peculiar to the Macedonians. This was used both to throw and\r\nas a pike. It exceeded in length all other missiles.--The Thracian\r\n_romphea_, which had a very long point, like the blade of a sword,\r\nwas probably not unlike the sarissa.--With these weapons we may also\r\nclass the Illyrian _sibina_, which resembled a hunting-pole.--The\r\niron head of the German spear, called _framea_, was short and narrow,\r\nbut very sharp. The Germans used it with great effect either as a\r\nlance or a pike: they gave to each youth a framea and a shield on\r\ncoming of age.--The _Falarica_ or _Phalarica_ was the spear of the\r\nSaguntines, and was impelled by the aid of twisted ropes; it was\r\nlarge and ponderous, having a head of iron a cubit in length, and a\r\nball of lead at its other end; it sometimes carried flaming pitch and\r\ntow.--The _matura_ and _tragula_ were chiefly used in Gaul and Spain:\r\nthe tragula was probably barbed, as it required to be cut out of the\r\nwound.--The _Aclis_ and _Cateia_ were much smaller missiles.--Among\r\nthe decorations which the Roman generals bestowed on their soldiers,\r\nmore especially for saving the life of a fellow-citizen, was a spear\r\nwithout a head, called _hasta pura_. The _celibaris hasta_, having\r\nbeen fixed into the body of a gladiator lying dead on the arena,\r\nwas used at marriages to part the hair of the bride. A spear was\r\nerected at auctions [AUCTIO], and when tenders were received for\r\npublic offices (_locationes_). It served both to announce, by a\r\nconventional sign conspicuous at a distance, that a sale was going\r\non, and to show that it was conducted under the authority of the\r\npublic functionaries. Hence an auction was called _hasta_, and an\r\nauction-room _hastarium_. It was also the practice to set up a spear\r\nin the court of the CENTUMVIRI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASTĀTI. [EXERCITUS, p. 168, b.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHĔCĂTOMBĒ. [SACRIFICIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHECTĒ or HECTEUS (ἕκτη, ἑκτεύς), and its half, _Hemiecton_ or\r\n_Hemiecteon_ (ἡμίεκτον, ἡμιεκτέον). In dry measures, the _hecteus_\r\nwas the sixth part of the _medimnus_, and the _hemiecteon_, of\r\ncourse, the twelfth part. The _hecteus_ was equal to the Roman\r\n_modius_, as each contained 16 ξέσται or sextarii. The _Hecte_ or\r\n_Hecteus_ and _Hemiecton_ were also the names of coins, but the\r\naccounts we have of their value are very various. The only consistent\r\nexplanation is, that there were different _hectae_, derived from\r\ndifferent units; in fact, that these coins were not properly\r\n_denominations_ of money, but _subdivisions_ of the recognised\r\ndenominations.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĔLĔPŎLIS (ἑλέπολις), “the taker of cities,” a machine constructed\r\nby Demetrius Poliorcetes, when he besieged the city of Salamis in\r\nCyprus. Its form was that of a square tower, each side being 90\r\ncubits high and 45 wide. It rested on four wheels, each eight cubits\r\nhigh. It was divided into nine stories, the lower of which contained\r\nmachines for throwing great stones, the middle large catapults for\r\nthrowing spears, and the highest other machines for throwing smaller\r\nstones, together with smaller catapults. It was manned with 200\r\nsoldiers, besides those who moved it by pushing the parallel beams\r\nat the bottom. At the siege of Rhodes, B.C. 306, Demetrius employed\r\nan helepolis of still greater dimensions and more complicated\r\nconstruction. In subsequent ages we find the name of “helepolis”\r\napplied to moving towers which carried battering rams, as well as\r\nmachines for throwing spears and stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELLĀNŎDĬCAE (ἑλλανοδίκαι), the judges in the Olympic games, of whom\r\nan account is given under OLYMPIA. The same name was also given to\r\nthe judges or court-martial in the Lacedaemonian army, and they were\r\nprobably first called by this name when Sparta was at the head of the\r\nGreek confederacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELLĒNOTĂMĬAE (ἑλληνοταμίαι), or treasurers of the Greeks, were\r\nmagistrates appointed by the Athenians to receive the contributions\r\nof the allied states. They were first appointed B.C. 477, when\r\nAthens, in consequence of the conduct of Pausanias, had obtained the\r\ncommand of the allied states. The money paid by the different states,\r\nwhich was originally fixed at 460 talents, was deposited in Delos,\r\nwhich was the place of meeting for the discussion of all common\r\ninterests; and there can be no doubt that the hellenotamiae not only\r\nreceived, but were also the guardians of, these monies. The office\r\nwas retained after the treasury was transferred to Athens on the\r\nproposal of the Samians, but was of course abolished on the conquest\r\nof Athens by the Lacedaemonians.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĒLŌTES (εἴλωτες), a class of bondsmen peculiar to Sparta. They were\r\nAchaeans, who had resisted the Dorian invaders to the last, and had\r\nbeen reduced to slavery as the punishment of their obstinacy. The\r\nHelots were regarded as the property of the state, which, while it\r\ngave their services to individuals, reserved to itself the power of\r\nemancipating them. They were attached to the land, and could not\r\nbe sold away from it. They cultivated the land, and paid to their\r\nmasters as rent a certain measure of corn, the exact amount of which\r\nhad been fixed at a very early period, the raising of that amount\r\nbeing forbidden under heavy imprecations. Besides being engaged in\r\nthe cultivation of the land, the Helots attended on their masters\r\nat the public meal, and many of them were no doubt employed by the\r\nstate in public works. In war the Helots served as light-armed troops\r\n(ψίλοι), a certain number of them attending every heavy-armed Spartan\r\nto the field; at the battle of Plataeae there were seven Helots to\r\neach Spartan. These attendants were probably called ἀμπίτταρες(i.e.\r\nἀμφίσταντες), and one of them in particular, the θεράπων, or\r\n_servant_. The Helots only served as hoplites in particular\r\nemergencies; and on such occasions they were generally emancipated.\r\nThe first instance of this kind was in the expedition of Brasidas,\r\nB.C. 424. The treatment to which the Helots were subjected was marked\r\nby the most wanton cruelty; and they were regarded by the Spartans\r\nwith the greatest suspicion. Occasionally the ephors selected\r\nyoung Spartans for the secret service (κρυπτεία) of wandering over\r\nthe country, in order to kill the Helots. The Helots might be\r\nemancipated, but there were several steps between them and the free\r\ncitizens, and it is doubtful whether they were ever admitted to all\r\nthe privileges of citizenship. The following classes of emancipated\r\nHelots are enumerated:--ἀφεταί, ἀδεσπότοι, ἐρυκτῆρες, δεσποσιοναύται,\r\nand νεοδαμώδεις. Of these the ἀφεταί were probably released from all\r\nservice; the ἐρυκτῆρες were those employed in war; the δεσποσιοναύται\r\nserved on board the fleet; and the νεοδαμώδεις were those who had\r\nbeen possessed of freedom for some time. Besides these, there were\r\nthe μόθωνες or μόθακες, who were domestic slaves, brought up with the\r\nyoung Spartans, and then emancipated. Upon being emancipated they\r\nreceived permission to dwell where they wished.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĒMĔRŎDRŎMI (ἡμεροδρόμοι), couriers in the Greek states, who could\r\nkeep on running all day, and were often employed to carry news of\r\nimportant events. They were trained for the purpose, and could\r\nperform the longest journeys in an almost incredibly short space\r\nof time. Such couriers were in times of danger stationed on some\r\neminence in order to observe anything of importance that might\r\nhappen, and carry the intelligence with speed to the proper quarter.\r\nHence we frequently find them called _Hemeroscopi_ (ἡμεροσκόποι).\r\n\r\n\r\nHĒMĬCYCLĬUM (ἡμικύκλιον), a semicircular seat, for the accommodation\r\nof persons engaged in conversation; also the semicircular seat round\r\nthe tribunal in a basilica.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĒMĬNA (ἡμίνα), the name of a Greek and Roman measure, seems to\r\nbe nothing more than the dialectic form used by the Sicilian and\r\nItalian Greeks for ἡμίσυ. It was therefore applied to the half of the\r\nstandard fluid measure, the ξέστης, which the other Greeks called\r\nκοτύλη, and the word passed into the Roman metrical system, where it\r\nis used with exactly the same force, namely for a measure which is\r\nhalf of the _sextarius_, and equal to the Greek _cotylé_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENDĔCA (οἱ ἕνδεκα), the Eleven, were magistrates at Athens of\r\nconsiderable importance. They were annually chosen by lot, one from\r\neach of the ten tribes, and a secretary (γραμματεύς), who must\r\nproperly be regarded as their servant (ὑπηρέτης), though he formed\r\none of their number. The principal duty of the Eleven was the care\r\nand management of the public prison (δεσμωτήριον), which was entirely\r\nunder their jurisdiction. The prison, however, was seldom used by\r\nthe Athenians as a mere place of confinement, serving generally for\r\npunishments and executions. When a person was condemned to death he\r\nwas immediately given into the custody of the Eleven, who were then\r\nbound to carry the sentence into execution according to the laws.\r\nThe most common mode of execution was by hemlock juice (κώνειον),\r\nwhich was drunk after sunset. The Eleven had under them gaolers,\r\nexecutioners, and torturers. When torture was inflicted in causes\r\naffecting the state, it was either done in the immediate presence\r\nof the Eleven, or by their servant (ὁ δήμιος). The Eleven usually\r\nhad only to carry into execution the sentence passed in the courts\r\nof law and the public assemblies; but in some cases they possessed\r\njurisdiction. This was the case in those summary proceedings called\r\n_apagoge_, _ephegesis_ and _endeixis_, in which the penalty was\r\nfixed by law, and might be inflicted by the court on the confession\r\nor conviction of the accused, without appealing to any of the jury\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nHĒPHAESTEIA. [LAMPADEPHORIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHĒRAEA (ἡραῖα), the name of festivals celebrated in honour of Hera\r\nin all the towns of Greece where the worship of this divinity was\r\nintroduced. The original seat of her worship was Argos; whence her\r\nfestivals in other places were, more or less, imitations of those\r\nwhich were celebrated at Argos. Her service was performed by the\r\nmost distinguished priestesses of the place; one of them was the\r\nhigh-priestess, and the Argives counted their years by the date of\r\nher office. The Heraea of Argos were celebrated every fifth year.\r\nOne of the great solemnities which took place on the occasion, was\r\na magnificent procession to the great temple of Hera, between Argos\r\nand Mycenae. A vast number of young men assembled at Argos, and\r\nmarched in armour to the temple of the goddess. They were preceded\r\nby one hundred oxen (ἑκατόμβη, whence the festival is also called\r\nἑκατόμβαια). The high-priestess accompanied this procession, riding\r\nin a chariot drawn by two white oxen. The 100 oxen were sacrificed,\r\nand their flesh distributed among all the citizens; after which\r\ngames and contests took place. Of the Heraea celebrated in other\r\ncountries, those of Samos, which island derived the worship of Hera\r\nfrom Argos, were perhaps the most brilliant of all the festivals\r\nof this divinity. The Heraea of Elis, which were celebrated in the\r\nfourth year of every Olympiad, were also conducted with considerable\r\nsplendour.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĒRES.--(1) GREEK. To obtain the right of inheritance as well as\r\ncitizenship at Athens (ἀγχιστεία and πολιτεία), legitimacy was a\r\nnecessary qualification. When an Athenian died leaving legitimate\r\nsons, they shared the inheritance, like our heirs in gavelkind; the\r\nonly advantage possessed by the eldest son being the first choice\r\nin the division. Every man of full age and sound mind, not under\r\ndurance or improper influence, was competent to make a will; but if\r\nhe had a son he could not disinherit him, although his will might\r\ntake effect in case the son did not complete his seventeenth year.\r\nIf there was but one son, he took the whole estate; but if he had\r\nsisters, it was incumbent on him to provide for them, and give them\r\nsuitable marriage portions; they were then called ἐπίπροικοι. On\r\nfailure of sons and their issue, daughters and daughters’ children\r\nsucceeded, and there seems to have been no limit to the succession in\r\nthe descending line. It will assist the student to be informed, that\r\nἀνεψιός signifies a first cousin. Ἀνεψιαδοῦς is a first cousin’s son;\r\nformed in the same manner as ἀδελφιδοῦς from ἀδελφός, and θυγατριδοῦς\r\nfrom θυγατήρ. Κλῆρος is the subject-matter of inheritance, or (in one\r\nsense of the word) the inheritance; κληρόνομος the heir. Ἀγχιστεία,\r\nproximity of blood in reference to succession, and sometimes right of\r\nsuccession. Συγγένεια, natural consanguinity. Συγγενεῖς, collateral\r\nrelations, are opposed to ἔκγονοι, lineal descendants.--(2) ROMAN. A\r\nperson might become an heres by being named as such (_institutus_,\r\n_scriptus_, _factus_) in a will executed by a competent person,\r\naccording to the forms required by law [TESTAMENTUM]. The testator\r\nmight either name one person as heres, or he might name several\r\nheredes (_coheredes_), and he might divide the hereditas among\r\nthem as he pleased. The shares of the heredes were generally\r\nexpressed by reference to the divisions of the As: thus, “heres ex\r\nasse” is heres to the whole property; “heres ex dodrante,” heres\r\nto three-fourths; “heres ex semuncia,” heir to one twenty-fourth.\r\nIf there were several heredes named, without any definite shares\r\nbeing given to them, the property belonged to them in equal shares.\r\nAs a general rule, only Roman citizens could be named as heredes\r\nin the will of a Roman citizen; but a slave could also be named\r\nheres, though he had no power to make a will, and a filius-familias\r\ncould also be named heres, though he was under the same incapacity.\r\nPersons, not Roman citizens, who had received the commercium, could\r\ntake hereditates, legata and fideicommissa by testament.--Heredes\r\nwere either Necessarii, Sui et Necessarii, or Extranei. The heres\r\nnecessarius was a slave of the testator, who was made an heres and\r\nliber at the same time; and he was called necessarius, because of\r\nthe necessity that he was under of accepting the hereditas. The\r\nheredes sui et necessarii were sons and daughters, and the sons\r\nand daughters of a son, who were in the power of a testator. These\r\nheredes sui were called necessarii, because of the necessity that\r\nthey were under, according to the civil law, of taking the hereditas\r\nwith its incumbrances. But the praetor permitted such persons to\r\nrefuse the hereditas (_abstinere se ab hereditate_), and to allow\r\nthe property to be sold to pay the testator’s debts; and he gave the\r\nsame privilege to a mancipated son (_qui in causa mancipii est_). All\r\nother heredes are called extranei, and comprehend all persons who\r\nare not in the power of a testator, such as emancipated children. A\r\ncertain time was allowed to extranei for the _cretio hereditatis_,\r\nthat is, for them to determine whether they would take the hereditas\r\nor not: hence the phrase, “cernere hereditatem.”--If a man died\r\nintestate, the hereditas came to the heredes sui, and was then called\r\n_legitima hereditas_. If an intestate had no sui heredes, the Twelve\r\nTables gave the hereditas to the agnati [COGNATI], and if there were\r\nno agnati, to the gentiles. If a man had a son in his power, he was\r\nbound either to make him heres, or to exheredate (_exheredare_) him\r\nexpressly (_nominatim_). If he passed him over in silence (_silentio\r\npraetericrit_), the will was altogether void (_inutile_, _non jure\r\nfactum_). Other liberi could be passed over, and the will would\r\nstill be a valid will; but the liberi so passed over took a certain\r\nportion of the hereditas _adcrescendo_, as it was termed, or _jure\r\nadcrescendi_. It was necessary either to institute as heredes, or\r\nto exheredate posthumous children _nominatim_, otherwise the will,\r\nwhich was originally valid, became invalid (_ruptum_); and the will\r\nbecame invalid by the birth either of a posthumous son or daughter,\r\nor, as the phrase was, _adgnascendo rumpitur testamentum_. The heres\r\nrepresented the testator and intestate, and had not only a claim to\r\nall his property and all that was due to him, but was bound by all\r\nhis obligations. He succeeded to the sacra privata, and was bound\r\nto maintain them, but only in respect of the property, for the\r\nobligation of the sacra privata was attached to property and to the\r\nheres only as the owner of it. Hence the expression “sine sacris\r\nhereditas” meant an hereditas unencumbered with sacra.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERMAE (ἑρμαῖ), and the diminutive Hermuli (ἑρμίδια), statues\r\ncomposed of a head, usually that of the god Hermes, placed on a\r\nquadrangular pillar, the height of which corresponds to the stature\r\nof the human body. Such statues were very numerous at Athens. So\r\ngreat was the demand for these works that the words ἑρμογλύφος,\r\nἑρμογλυφικὴ τέχνη, and ἑρμογλυφεῖον, were used as the generic terms\r\nfor a sculptor, his art, and his studio. Houses in Athens had one of\r\nthese statues placed at the door, called ἑρμῆς στροφαῖος or στροφεύς;\r\nand sometimes also in the peristyle. The great reverence attached to\r\nthem is shown by the alarm and indignation which were felt at Athens\r\nin consequence of the mutilation of the whole number in a single\r\nnight, just before the sailing of the Sicilian expedition. They were\r\nlikewise placed in front of temples, near to tombs, in the gymnasia,\r\npalaestrae, libraries, porticoes, and public places, at the corners\r\nof streets, on high roads as sign-posts, with distances inscribed\r\nupon them, and on the boundaries of lands and states, and at the\r\ngates of cities. Small Hermae were also used as pilasters, and as\r\nsupports for furniture and utensils. Many statues existed of other\r\ndeities, of the same form as the Hermae; which no doubt originated\r\nin the same manner; and which were still called by the generic name\r\nof _Hermae_; even though the bust upon them was that of another\r\ndeity. Some statues of this kind are described by a name compounded\r\nof that of Hermes and another divinity: thus we have _Hermanubis_,\r\n_Hermares_, _Hermathena_, _Hermeracles_, _Hermeros_, _Hermopan_.\r\nThere is another class of these works, in which the bust represented\r\nno deity at all, but was simply the portrait of a man. Even these\r\nstatues, however, retained the names of _Hermae_ and _Termini_. The\r\nHermae were used by the wealthy Romans for the decoration of their\r\nhouses. The following engraving exhibits a Hermes decorated with\r\ngarlands and surrounded with the implements of his worship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hermes. (From a Bas-relief.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nHERMAEA (ἕρμαια), festivals of Hermes, celebrated in various parts\r\nof Greece. As Hermes was the tutelary deity of the gymnasia and\r\npalaestrae, the boys at Athens celebrated the Hermaea in the gymnasia.\r\n\r\n\r\nHESTIĀSIS (ἑστίασις), was a species of liturgy, and consisted in\r\ngiving a feast to one of the tribes at Athens (τὴν φυλὴν ἑστιᾶν). It\r\nwas provided for each tribe at the expense of a person belonging to\r\nthat tribe, who was called ἑστιάτωρ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĬĔRODŪLI (ἱερόδουλοι), persons of both sexes, who were devoted like\r\nslaves to the worship of the gods. They were of Eastern origin, and\r\nare most frequently met with in connection with the worship of the\r\ndeities of Syria, Phoenicia, and Asia Minor. They consisted of two\r\nclasses; one composed of slaves, properly so called, who attended\r\nto all the lower duties connected with the worship of the gods,\r\ncultivated the sacred lands, &c., and whose descendants continued\r\nin the same servile condition; and the other comprising persons who\r\nwere personally free, but had dedicated themselves as slaves to the\r\ngods, and who were either attached to the temples, or were dispersed\r\nthroughout the country and brought to the gods the money they had\r\ngained. To the latter class belonged the women, who prostituted their\r\npersons, and presented to the gods the money they had obtained by\r\nthis means. This class was only found in Greece, in connection with\r\nthe worship of those divinities who were of Eastern origin, or whose\r\nreligious rites were borrowed from the East. This was the case with\r\nAphrodite (Venus), who was originally an Oriental goddess.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĬĔRŎMNĒMŎNES (ἱερομνήμονες), the more honourable of the two classes\r\nof representatives who composed the Amphictyonic council. An account\r\nof them is given under AMPHICTYONES.--We also read of hieromnemones\r\nin Grecian states, distinct from the Amphictyonic representatives\r\nof this name. Thus the priests of Poseidon, at Megara, were called\r\nhieromnemones, and at Byzantium, which was a colony of Megara, the\r\nchief magistrate in the state appears to have been called by this\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĬĔRŎNĪCAE. [ATHLETAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHĬĔRŎPOII (ἱεροποιοί), sacrificers at Athens, of whom ten were\r\nappointed every year, and conducted all the usual sacrifices, as well\r\nas those belonging to the quinquennial festivals, with the exception\r\nof those of the Panathenaea.\r\n\r\n\r\nHĬLĂRĬA (ἱλάρια), a Roman festival, celebrated on the 25th of March,\r\nin honour of Cybelé, the mother of the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIPPŎBŎTAE (ἱπποβόται), the feeders of horses, the name of the\r\nnobility of Chalcis in Euboea, corresponding to the ἱππεῖς in other\r\nGreek states.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIPPŎDRŎMUS (ἱππόδρομος), the name by which the Greeks designated\r\nthe place appropriated to the horse-races, both of chariots and of\r\nsingle horses, which formed a part of their games. The word was also\r\napplied to the races themselves. In Homer’s vivid description (_Il._\r\nxxiii., 262-650) the nature of the contest and the arrangements for\r\nit are very clearly indicated. There is no artificially constructed\r\nhippodrome; but an existing land-mark or monument (σῆμα) is chosen\r\nas the goal (τέρμα), round which the chariots had to pass, leaving\r\nit on the left hand, and so returning to the Greek ships on the\r\nsea-shore, from which they had started. The chariots were five in\r\nnumber, each with two horses and a single driver, who stood upright\r\nin his chariot. The critical point of the race was to turn the goal\r\nas sharp as possible, with the nave of the near wheel almost grazing\r\nit, and to do this safely: very often the driver was here thrown out,\r\nand the chariot broken in pieces. The account in Homer will give us\r\nan equally good idea of a chariot-race at Olympia, or in any other of\r\nthe Greek games of later times. The general form of the hippodrome\r\nwas an oblong, with a semicircular end. For an account of the chariot\r\nraces at Rome see CIRCUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTRĬO (ὑποκριτής), an actor.--(1) GREEK. It is shown in the\r\narticles CHORUS and DIONYSIA that the Greek drama originated in the\r\nchorus which at the festivals of Dionysus danced around his altar,\r\nand that at first one person detached himself from the chorus, and,\r\nwith mimic gesticulation, related his story either to the chorus\r\nor in conversation with it. If the story thus acted required more\r\nthan one person, they were all represented in succession by the same\r\nactor, and there was never more than one person on the stage at a\r\ntime. This custom was retained by Thespis and Phrynichus. Aeschylus\r\nintroduced a second and a third actor; and the number of three\r\nactors was but seldom exceeded in any Greek drama. The three regular\r\nactors were distinguished by the technical names of πρωταγωνιστής,\r\nδευτεραγωνιστής, and τριταγωνιστής, which indicated the more or\r\nless prominent part which an actor had to perform in the drama. The\r\nfemale characters of a play were always performed by young men.\r\nA distinct class of persons, who made acting on the stage their\r\nprofession, was unknown to the Greeks during the period of their\r\ngreat dramatists. The earliest and greatest dramatic poets, Thespis,\r\nSophocles, and probably Aeschylus also, acted in their own plays, and\r\nin all probability as protagonistae. It was not thought degrading\r\nin Greece to perform on the stage. At a later period persons began\r\nto devote themselves exclusively to the profession of actors, and\r\ndistinguished individuals received even as early as the time of\r\nDemosthenes exorbitant sums for their performances.--(2) ROMAN. The\r\nword _histrio_, by which the Roman actor was called, is said to have\r\nbeen formed from the Etruscan _hister_, which signified a ludio or\r\ndancer. In the year 364 B.C. Rome was visited by a plague, and as\r\nno human means could stop it, the Romans are said to have tried to\r\navert the anger of the gods by scenic plays (_ludi scenici_), which,\r\nuntil then, had been unknown to them; and as there were no persons at\r\nRome prepared for such performances, the Romans sent to Etruria for\r\nthem. The first histriones, who were thus introduced from Etruria,\r\nwere dancers, and performed their movements to the accompaniment of\r\na flute. Roman youths afterwards not only imitated these dancers,\r\nbut also recited rude and jocose verses, adapted to the movements\r\nof the dance and the melody of the flute. This kind of amusement,\r\nwhich was the basis of the Roman drama, remained unaltered until the\r\ntime of Livius Andronicus, who introduced a slave upon the stage for\r\nthe purpose of singing or reciting the recitative, while he himself\r\nperformed the appropriate dance and gesticulation. A further step in\r\nthe development of the drama, which is likewise ascribed to Livius,\r\nwas, that the dancer and reciter carried on a dialogue, and acted a\r\nstory with the accompaniment of the flute. The name histrio, which\r\noriginally signified a dancer, was now applied to the actors in\r\nthe drama. The atellanae were played by freeborn Romans, while the\r\nregular drama was left to the histriones, who formed a distinct class\r\nof persons. The histriones were not citizens; they were not contained\r\nin the tribes, nor allowed to be enlisted as soldiers in the Roman\r\nlegions; and if any citizen entered the profession of an histrio, he,\r\non this account, was excluded from his tribe. The histriones were\r\ntherefore always either freedmen, strangers, or slaves, and many\r\npassages of Roman writers show that they were generally held in great\r\ncontempt. Towards the close of the republic it was only such men as\r\nCicero, who, by their Greek education, raised themselves above the\r\nprejudices of their countrymen, and valued the person no less than\r\nthe talents of an Aesopus and a Roscius. But notwithstanding this\r\nlow estimation in which actors were generally held, distinguished\r\nindividuals among them attracted immense crowds to the theatres, and\r\nwere exorbitantly paid. Roscius alone received every day that he\r\nperformed one thousand denarii, and Aesopus left his son a fortune of\r\n200,000 sesterces, which he had acquired solely by his profession.\r\nThe pay of the actors was called _lucar_, which word was perhaps\r\nconfined originally to the payment made to those who took part in the\r\nreligious services celebrated in groves.\r\n\r\n\r\nHŎMOEI (ὅμοιοι), the Equals, were those Spartans who possessed the\r\nfull rights of citizenship, and are opposed to the ὑπομείονες,\r\nor those who had undergone some kind of civil degradation. This\r\ndistinction between the citizens was no part of the ancient Spartan\r\nconstitution. In the institution ascribed to Lycurgus, every\r\ncitizen had a certain portion of land; but as in course of time\r\nmany citizens lost their lands through various causes, they were\r\nunable to contribute to the expenses of the syssitia, and therefore\r\nceased to possess the full rights of Spartan citizens. Hence the\r\ndistinction appears to have arisen between the ὅμοιοι and ὑπομείονες,\r\nthe former being those who were in the possession of their land,\r\nand consequently able to contribute to the syssitia, the latter\r\nthose who through having no land were unable to do so. The Homoei\r\nwere the ruling class in the state. They filled all the public\r\noffices with the exception of the Ephoralty, and they probably met\r\ntogether to determine upon public affairs under the name of ἔκκλητοι\r\nin an assembly of their own, which is called ἡ μικρὰ ἐκκλησία,\r\nto distinguish it from the assembly of the whole body of Spartan\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nHŎNŌRES, the high offices of the state to which qualified individuals\r\nwere called by the votes of the Roman citizens. The words\r\n“magistratus” and “honores” are sometimes coupled together. The\r\ncapacity of enjoying the honores was one of the distinguishing marks\r\nof citizenship. [CIVITAS.] _Honor_ was distinguished from _munus_.\r\nThe latter was an office connected with the administration of the\r\nstate, and was attended with cost (_sumptus_) but not with rank\r\n(_dignitas_). Honor was properly said _deferri, dari_; munus was said\r\n_imponi_. A person who held a magistrates might be said to discharge\r\n_munera_, but only as incident to the office, for the office itself\r\nwas the _honor_. Such munera as these were public games and other\r\nthings of the kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPLĪTAE. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHŌRA. [DIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHŌRŎLŎGĬUM (ὡρολόγιον), the name of the various instruments by means\r\nof which the ancients measured the time of the day and night. The\r\nearliest and simplest horologia of which mention is made, were called\r\n_polos_ (πόλος) and _gnomon_ (γνώμων). Both divided the day into\r\ntwelve equal parts, and were a kind of sun-dial. The _gnomon_, which\r\nwas also called _stoicheion_ (στοιχεῖον), was the more simple of the\r\ntwo, and probably the more ancient. It consisted of a staff or pillar\r\nstanding perpendicular, in a place exposed to the sun (σκιάθηρον),\r\nso that the length of its shadow might be easily ascertained. The\r\nshadow of the gnomon was measured by feet, which were probably marked\r\non the place where the shadow fell. In later times the name gnomon\r\nwas applied to any kind of sun-dial, especially to its finger which\r\nthrew the shadow, and thus pointed to the hour. The _polos_ or\r\n_heliotropion_ (ἡλιοτρόπιον), on the other hand, seems to have been a\r\nmore perfect kind of sun-dial; but it appears, nevertheless, not to\r\nhave been much used. It consisted of a basin (λεκανίς), in the middle\r\nof which the perpendicular staff or finger (γνώμων) was erected, and\r\nin it the twelve parts of the day were marked by lines.--Another\r\nkind of horologium, was the _clepsydra_ (κλεψύδρα). It derived its\r\nname from κλέπτειν and ὕδωρ, as in its original and simple form it\r\nconsisted of a vessel with several little openings (τρυπήματα) at\r\nthe bottom, through which the water contained in it escaped, as it\r\nwere by stealth. This instrument seems at first to have been used\r\nonly for the purpose of measuring the time during which persons were\r\nallowed to speak in the courts of justice at Athens. It was a hollow\r\nglobe, probably somewhat flat at the top-part, where it had a short\r\nneck (αὐλός), like that of a bottle, through which the water was\r\npoured into it. This opening might be closed by a lid or stopper\r\n(πῶμα), to prevent the water running out at the bottom. As the time\r\nfor speaking in the Athenian courts was thus measured by water, the\r\norators frequently use the term ὕδωρ instead of the time allowed to\r\nthem. An especial officer (ὁ ἐφ’ ὕδωρ) was appointed in the courts\r\nfor the purpose of watching the clepsydra, and stopping it when any\r\ndocuments were read, whereby the speaker was interrupted. The time,\r\nand consequently the quantity of water allowed to a speaker, depended\r\nupon the importance of the case. The clepsydra used, in the courts of\r\njustice was, properly speaking, no horologium; but smaller ones, made\r\nof glass, and of the same simple structure, were undoubtedly used\r\nvery early in families for the purposes of ordinary life, and for\r\ndividing the day into twelve equal parts. In these glass-clepsydrae\r\nthe division into twelve parts must have been visible, either on the\r\nglass globe itself, or in the basin into which the water flowed.--The\r\nfirst horologium with which the Romans became acquainted was a\r\nsun-dial (_solarium_ or _horologium sciothericum_), and was said to\r\nhave been brought to Rome by Papirius Cursor twelve years before the\r\nwar with Pyrrhus. But as sun-dials were useless when the sky was\r\ncloudy, P. Scipio Nasica, in his censorship, 159 B.C., established a\r\npublic clepsydra, which indicated the hours both of day and night.\r\nThis clepsydra was in after times generally called solarium. After\r\nthe time of Scipio Nasica several horologia, chiefly solaria, seem\r\nto have been erected in various public places at Rome. Clepsydrae\r\nwere used by the Romans in their camps, chiefly for the purpose of\r\nmeasuring accurately the four vigiliae into which the night was\r\ndivided. The custom of using clepsydrae as a check upon the speakers\r\nin the courts of justice at Rome, was introduced by a law of Cn.\r\nPompeius, in his third consulship. Before that time the speakers had\r\nbeen under no restrictions, but spoke as long as they deemed proper.\r\nAt Rome, as at Athens, the time allowed to the speakers depended upon\r\nthe importance of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORRĔUM (ὡρεῖον, σιτοφυλακεῖον, ἀποθήκη) was, according to its\r\netymological signification, a place in which ripe fruits, and\r\nespecially corn, were kept, and thus answered to our granary. During\r\nthe empire the name horreum was given to any place destined for the\r\nsafe preservation of things of any kind. Thus we find it applied\r\nto a place in which beautiful works of art were kept, to cellars\r\n(_horrea subterranea_, _horrea vinaria_), to depôts for merchandise,\r\nand all sorts of provisions (_horreum penarium_). Seneca even calls\r\nhis library a horreum. But the more general application of the word\r\nhorreum was to places for keeping fruit and corn; and as some kinds\r\nof fruit required to be kept more dry than others, the ancients had\r\nbesides the horrea subterranea, or cellars, two other kinds, one of\r\nwhich was built like every other house upon the ground; but others\r\n(_horrea pensilia_ or _sublimia_) were erected above the ground,\r\nand rested upon posts or stone pillars, that the fruits kept in\r\nthem might remain dry.--From about the year 140 after Christ, Rome\r\npossessed two kinds of public horrea. The one class consisted of\r\nbuildings in which the Romans might deposit their goods, and even\r\ntheir money, securities, and other valuables. The second and more\r\nimportant class of horrea, which may be termed public granaries, were\r\nbuildings in which a plentiful supply of corn was constantly kept at\r\nthe expense of the state, and from which, in seasons of scarcity, the\r\ncorn was distributed among the poor, or sold at a moderate price.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORTUS (κῆπος), garden. Our knowledge of the horticulture of the\r\nGreeks is very limited. In fact the Greeks seem to have had no\r\ngreat taste for landscape beauties, and the small number of flowers\r\nwith which they were acquainted afforded but little inducement to\r\nornamental horticulture. At Athens the flowers most cultivated\r\nwere probably those used for making garlands, such as violets and\r\nroses. In the time of the Ptolemies the art of gardening seems to\r\nhave advanced in the favourable climate of Egypt so far, that a\r\nsuccession of flowers was obtained all the year round. The Romans,\r\nlike the Greeks, laboured under the disadvantage of a very limited\r\nflora. This disadvantage they endeavoured to overcome, by arranging\r\nthe materials they did possess in such a way as to produce a striking\r\neffect. We have a very full description of a Roman garden in a letter\r\nof the younger Pliny, in which he describes his Tuscan villa. In\r\nfront of the _porticus_ there was generally a _xystus_, or flat piece\r\nof ground, divided into flower-beds of different shapes by borders\r\nof box. There were also such flower-beds in other parts of the\r\ngarden. Sometimes they were raised so as to form terraces, and their\r\nsloping sides planted with evergreens or creepers. The most striking\r\nfeatures of a Roman garden were lines of large trees, among which\r\nthe plane appears to have been a great favourite, planted in regular\r\norder; alleys or walks (_ambulationes_) formed by closely clipped\r\nhedges of box, yew, cypress, and other evergreens; beds of acanthus,\r\nrows of fruit-trees, especially of vines, with statues, pyramids,\r\nfountains, and summer-houses (_diaetae_). The trunks of the trees\r\nand the parts of the house or any other buildings which were visible\r\nfrom the garden, were often covered with ivy. In one respect the\r\nRoman taste differed most materially from that of the present day,\r\nnamely, in their fondness for the _ars topiaria_, which consisted in\r\ntying, twisting, or cutting trees and shrubs (especially the box)\r\ninto the figures of animals, ships, letters, &c. Their principal\r\ngarden-flowers seem to have been violets and roses, and they also\r\nhad the crocus, narcissus, lily, gladiolus, iris, poppy, amaranth,\r\nand others. Conservatories and hot-houses are frequently mentioned\r\nby Martial. Flowers and plants were also kept in the central place\r\nof the peristyle [DOMUS], on the roofs and in the windows of houses.\r\nAn ornamental garden was also called _viridarium_, and the gardener\r\n_topiarius_ or _viridarius_. The common name for a gardener is\r\nvillicus or cultor hortorum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hortus, Garden. (From a Painting at Herculaneum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPĬTĬUM (ξενία, προξενία), hospitality, was in Greece, as well as\r\nat Rome, of a two-fold nature, either private or public, in so far as\r\nit was either established between individuals, or between two states.\r\n(_Hospitium privatum_ and _hospitium publicum_, ξενία and προξενία.)\r\nIn ancient Greece the stranger, as such (ξένος and _hostis_), was\r\nlooked upon as an enemy; but whenever he appeared among another tribe\r\nor nation without any sign of hostile intentions, he was considered\r\nnot only as one who required aid, but as a suppliant, and Zeus was\r\nthe protecting deity of strangers and suppliants (Ζεὺς ξένιος).\r\nOn his arrival, therefore, the stranger was kindly received, and\r\nprovided with every thing necessary to make him comfortable. It\r\nseems to have been customary for the host, on the departure of the\r\nstranger, to break a die (ἀστράγαλος) in two, one half of which he\r\nhimself retained, while the other half was given to the stranger;\r\nand when at any future time they or their descendants met, they had\r\na means of recognising each other, and the hospitable connection was\r\nrenewed. Hospitality thus not only existed between the persons who\r\nhad originally formed it, but was transferred as an inheritance from\r\nfather to son. What has been said hitherto, only refers to _hospitium\r\nprivatum_; but of far greater importance was the _hospitium publicum_\r\n(προξενία, sometimes simply ξενία) or public hospitality, which\r\nexisted between two states, or between an individual or a family on\r\nthe one hand, and a whole state on the other. Of the latter kind of\r\npublic hospitality many instances are recorded, such as that between\r\nthe Peisistratids and Sparta, in which the people of Athens had no\r\nshare. The hospitium publicum among the Greeks arose undoubtedly from\r\nthe hospitium privatum, and it may have originated in two ways. When\r\nthe Greek tribes were governed by chieftains or kings, the private\r\nhospitality existing between the ruling families of two tribes may\r\nhave produced similar relations between their subjects, which, after\r\nthe abolition of the kingly power, continued to exist between the new\r\nrepublics as a kind of political inheritance of former times. Or a\r\nperson belonging to one state might have either extensive connections\r\nwith the citizens of another state, or entertain great partiality\r\nfor the other state itself, and thus offer to receive all those who\r\ncame from that state either on private or public business, and to\r\nact as their patron in his own city. This he at first did merely\r\nas a private individual, but the state to which he offered this\r\nkind service would naturally soon recognise and reward him for it.\r\nWhen two states established public hospitality, and no individuals\r\ncame forward to act as the representatives of their state, it was\r\nnecessary that in each state persons should be appointed to show\r\nhospitality to, and watch over the interests of, all persons who\r\ncame from the state connected by hospitality. The persons who were\r\nappointed to this office as the recognised agents of the state\r\nfor which they acted were called _proxeni_ (πρόξενοι), but those\r\nwho undertook it voluntarily _etheloproxeni_ (ἐθελοπρόξενοι). The\r\noffice of _proxenus_, which bears great resemblance to that of a\r\nmodern consul or minister-resident, was in some cases hereditary in\r\na particular family. When a state appointed a proxenus, it either\r\nsent out one of its own citizens to reside in the other state, or it\r\nselected one of the citizens of this state, and conferred upon him\r\nthe honour of proxenus. The former was, in early times, the custom\r\nof Sparta, where the kings had the right of selecting from among the\r\nSpartan citizens those whom they wished to send out as proxeni to\r\nother states. But in subsequent times this custom seems to have been\r\ngiven up, for we find that at Athens the family of Callias were the\r\nproxeni of Sparta, and at Argos, the Argive Alciphron. The principal\r\nduties of a proxenus were to receive those persons, especially\r\nambassadors, who came from the state which he represented; to procure\r\nfor them admission to the assembly, and seats in the theatre; to\r\nact as the patron of the strangers, and to mediate between the two\r\nstates if any disputes arose. If a stranger died in the state, the\r\nproxenus of his country had to take care of the property of the\r\ndeceased.--The hospitality of the Romans was, as in Greece, either\r\nhospitium privatum or publicum. Private hospitality with the Romans,\r\nhowever, seems to have been more accurately and legally defined than\r\nin Greece. The character of a _hospes_, _i.e._ a person connected with\r\na Roman by ties of hospitality, was deemed even more sacred, and to\r\nhave greater claims upon the host, than that of a person connected by\r\nblood or affinity. The relation of a hospes to his Roman friend was\r\nnext in importance to that of a cliens. The obligations which the\r\nconnection of hospitality with a foreigner imposed upon a Roman, were\r\nto receive in his house his hospes when travelling; and to protect,\r\nand, in case of need, to represent him as his patron in the courts of\r\njustice. Private hospitality thus gave to the hospes the claims upon\r\nhis host which the client had on his patron, but without any degree\r\nof the dependence implied in the clientele. Private hospitality\r\nwas established between individuals by mutual presents, or by the\r\nmediation of a third person, and hallowed by religion; for Jupiter\r\nhospitalis was thought to watch over the jus hospitii, as Zeus xenios\r\ndid with the Greeks, and the violation of it was as great a crime and\r\nimpiety at Rome as in Greece. When hospitality was formed, the two\r\nfriends used to divide between themselves a _tessera hospitalis_,\r\nby which, afterwards, they themselves or their descendants--for the\r\nconnection was hereditary as in Greece--might recognise one another.\r\nHospitality, when thus once established, could not be dissolved\r\nexcept by a formal declaration (_renuntiatio_), and in this case the\r\ntessera hospitalis was broken to pieces. Public hospitality seems\r\nlikewise to have existed at a very early period among the nations\r\nof Italy; but the first direct mention of public hospitality being\r\nestablished between Rome and another city, is after the Gauls had\r\ndeparted from Rome, when it was decreed that Caere should be rewarded\r\nfor its good services by the establishment of public hospitality\r\nbetween the two cities. The public hospitality after the war with the\r\nGauls gave to the Caerites the right of isopolity with Rome, that is,\r\nthe civitas without the suffragium and the honores. [COLONIA.] In\r\nthe later times of the republic we no longer find public hospitality\r\nestablished between Rome and a foreign state; but a relation which\r\namounted to the same thing was introduced in its stead, that is,\r\ntowns were raised to the rank of municipia, and thus obtained the\r\ncivitas without the suffragium and the honores; and when a town was\r\ndesirous of forming a similar relation with Rome, it entered into\r\nclientela to some distinguished Roman, who then acted as patron of\r\nthe client-town. But the custom of granting the honour of hospes\r\npublicus to a distinguished foreigner by a decree of the senate,\r\nseems to have existed down to the end of the republic. His privileges\r\nwere the same as those of a municeps, that is, he had the civitas,\r\nbut not the suffragium or the honores. Public hospitality was, like\r\nthe hospitium privatum, hereditary in the family of the person to\r\nwhom it had been granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nHỸĂCINTHĬA (ὑακίνθια), a great national festival, celebrated every\r\nyear at Amyclae by the Amyclaeans and Spartans, probably in honour of\r\nthe Amyclaean Apollo and Hyacinthus together. This Amyclaean Apollo,\r\nhowever, with whom Hyacinthus was assimilated in later times, must\r\nnot be confounded with Apollo, the national divinity of the Dorians.\r\nThe festival was called after the youthful hero Hyacinthus, who\r\nevidently derived his name from the flower hyacinth (the emblem of\r\ndeath among the ancient Greeks), and whom Apollo accidentally struck\r\ndead with a quoit. The Hyacinthia lasted for three days, and began\r\non the longest day of the Spartan month Hecatombeus, at the time\r\nwhen the tender flowers, oppressed by the heat of the sun, drooped\r\ntheir languid heads. On the first and last day of the Hyacinthia\r\nsacrifices were offered to the dead, and the death of Hyacinthus was\r\nlamented. During these two days, nobody wore any garlands at the\r\nrepasts, nor took bread, but only cakes and similar things, and when\r\nthe solemn repasts were over, everybody went home in the greatest\r\nquiet and order. The second day, however, was wholly spent in public\r\nrejoicings and amusements, such as horse-races, dances, processions,\r\n&c. The great importance attached to this festival by the Amyclaeans\r\nand Lacedaemonians is seen from the fact, that the Amyclaeans, even\r\nwhen they had taken the field against an enemy, always returned home\r\non the approach of the season of the Hyacinthia, that they might not\r\nbe obliged to neglect its celebration; and that in a treaty with\r\nSparta, B.C. 421, the Athenians, in order to show their good-will\r\ntowards Sparta, promised every year to attend the celebration of this\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYBRĔŌS GRĂPHĒ (ὕβρεως γραφή), an action prescribed by the Attic law\r\nfor wanton and contumelious injury to the person, whether in the\r\nnature of indecent (δι’ αἰσχρουργίας) or other assaults (διὰ πληγῶν).\r\nThe severity of the sentence extended to confiscation or death.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIS (ὕδραυλις), an hydraulic organ, invented by Ctesibius\r\nof Alexandria, who lived about B.C. 200. Its pipes were partly of\r\nbronze, and partly of reed. The number of its stops, and consequently\r\nof its rows of pipes, varied from one to eight. It continued in use\r\nso late as the ninth century of our era. The organ was well adapted\r\nto gratify the Roman people in the splendid entertainments provided\r\nfor them by the emperors and other opulent persons. Nero was very\r\ncurious about organs, both in regard to their musical effect and\r\ntheir mechanism. A contorniate coin of this emperor, in the British\r\nMuseum, shows an organ with a sprig of laurel on one side, and a man\r\nstanding on the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hydraulis, water-organ. (Coin of Nero in British\r\nMuseum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRĬAPHŎRĬA (ὑδριαφορία), was the carrying of a vessel with water\r\n(ὑδρία), which service the married alien (μέτοικοι) women had to\r\nperform to the married part of the female citizens of Athens, when\r\nthey walked to the temple of Athena in the great procession at the\r\nPanathenaea.\r\n\r\n\r\nHỸPORCHĒMA (ὑπόρχημα), a lively kind of mimic dance which accompanied\r\nthe songs used in the worship of Apollo, especially among the\r\nDorians. A chorus of singers at the festivals of Apollo usually\r\ndanced around the altar, while several other persons were appointed\r\nto accompany the action of the song with an appropriate mimic\r\nperformance (ὑπορχεῖσθαι). The hyporchema was thus a lyric dance, and\r\noften passed into the playful and comic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDUS. [CALENDARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNŌMĬNĬA. [CENSOR; INFAMIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNŌBĬLES. [NOBILES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nĬMĀGO, a representation or likeness, an image or figure of a person.\r\nAmong the Romans those persons, who had filled any of the higher or\r\ncurule magistracies of the state, had the right of having images of\r\nthemselves. Respecting this _jus imaginum_ see NOBILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMŪNĬTAS (from _in_ and _munus_), signifies, (1) A freedom from\r\ntaxes. (2) A freedom from services which other citizens had to\r\ndischarge. With respect to the first kind of immunitas we find that\r\nthe emperors frequently granted it to separate persons, or to certain\r\nclasses of persons, or to whole states. The second kind of immunitas\r\nwas granted to all persons who had a valid excuse (_excusatio_)\r\nto be released from such, services, and also to other persons as\r\na special favour. The immunitas might be either general, from all\r\nservices which a citizen owed to the state, or special, such as from\r\nmilitary service, from taking the office of tutor or guardian, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPĔRĀTOR. [IMPERIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPĔRĬUM, was under the republic a power, without which no military\r\noperation could be carried on as in the name and on the behalf of the\r\nstate. It was not incident to any office, and was always specially\r\nconferred by a lex curiata, that is, a lex passed in the comitia\r\ncuriata. Consequently, not even a consul could act as commander of\r\nan army, unless he were empowered by a lex curiata. It could not be\r\nheld or exercised within the city in the republican period; but it\r\nwas sometimes conferred specially upon an individual for the day\r\nof his triumph within the city, and at least, in some cases, by a\r\nplebiscitum. As opposed to _potestas, imperium_ is the power which\r\nwas conferred by the state upon an individual who was appointed to\r\ncommand an army. The phrases _consularis potestas_ and _consulare\r\nimperium_ might both be properly used; but the expression _tribunitia\r\npotestas_ only could be used, as the tribuni never received the\r\nimperium. In respect of his imperium, he who received it was styled\r\n_imperator_. After a victory it was usual for the soldiers to salute\r\ntheir commander as imperator, but this salutation neither gave nor\r\nconfirmed the title, since the title as a matter of course was given\r\nwith the imperium. Under the republic the title came properly after\r\nthe name; thus Cicero, when he was proconsul in Cilicia, could\r\nproperly style himself M. Tullius Cicero Imperator, for the term\r\nmerely expressed that he had the imperium. The emperors Tiberius and\r\nClaudius refused to assume the praenomen of imperator, but the use\r\nof it as a praenomen became established among their successors. The\r\nterm imperium was applied in the republican period to express the\r\nsovereignty of the Roman state. Thus Gaul is said by Cicero to have\r\ncome under the imperium and ditio of the populus Romanus.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPLŬVĬUM. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPŪBES. An infans was incapable of doing any legal act. An impubes,\r\nwho had passed the limits of infantia, could do any legal act with\r\nthe auctoritas of his tutor. With the attainment of pubertas, a\r\nperson obtained the full power over his property, and the tutela\r\nceased: he could also dispose of his property by will; and he could\r\ncontract marriage. Pubertas, in the case of a male, was attained\r\nwith the completion of the fourteenth, and, in a female, with the\r\ncompletion of the twelfth year. Upon attaining the age of puberty a\r\nRoman youth assumed the toga virilis, but until that time he wore the\r\ntoga praetexta, the broad purple hem of which (_praetexta_) at once\r\ndistinguished him from other persons. The toga virilis was assumed\r\nat the Liberalia in the month of March, and though no age appears to\r\nhave been positively fixed for the ceremony, it probably took place\r\nas a general rule on the feast which next followed the completion of\r\nthe fourteenth year; though it is certain that the completion of the\r\nfourteenth year was not always the time observed. Still, so long as a\r\nmale wore the praetexta, he was impubes, and when he assumed the toga\r\nvirilis, he was pubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGŬRĀTĬO, was in general the ceremony by which the augurs\r\nobtained, or endeavoured to obtain, the sanction of the gods to\r\nsomething which had been decreed by man; in particular, however,\r\nit was the ceremony by which things or persons were consecrated\r\nto the gods, whence the terms _dedicatio_ and _consecratio_ were\r\nsometimes used as synonymous with inauguratio. Not only were priests\r\ninaugurated, but also the higher magistrates, who for this purpose\r\nwere summoned by the augurs to appear on the capitol, on the third\r\nday after their election. This inauguratio conferred no priestly\r\ndignity upon the magistrates, but was merely a method of obtaining\r\nthe sanction of the gods to their election, and gave them the right\r\nto take auspicia; and on important emergencies it was their duty to\r\nmake use of this privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\nINAURIS, an ear-ring; called in Greek ἐνώτιον, because it was worn in\r\nthe ear (οὗς), and ἐλλόβιον, because it was inserted into the lobe\r\nof the ear (λοβός), which was bored for the purpose. Ear-rings were\r\nworn by both sexes in oriental countries. Among the Greeks and Romans\r\nthey were worn only by females. This ornament consisted of the ring\r\n(κρίκος), and of the drops (_stalagmia_). The ring was generally\r\nof gold, although the common people also wore ear-rings of bronze.\r\nInstead of a ring a hook was often used. The drops were sometimes of\r\ngold, very finely wrought, and sometimes of pearls.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENDĬUM, the crime of setting any object on fire, by which\r\nthe property of a man is endangered. A law of the Twelve Tables\r\ninflicted a severe punishment on the person who set fire to property\r\nmaliciously (_sciens_, _prudens_); but if it was done by accident\r\n(_casu_, _id est_, _negligentia_), the law obliged the offender to\r\nrepair the injury he had committed. Sulla, in his _Lex Cornelia\r\nde Sicariis_, punished malicious (_dolo malo_) incendium, but only\r\nin the city, or within a thousand paces of it, with aquae et ignis\r\ninterdictio. Cn. Pompeius, in B.C. 52, made incendium a crime of\r\n_Vis_ by his _Lex Pompeia de Vi_, in consequence of the burning of\r\nthe Curia and the Porcia Basilica on the burial of Clodius; and\r\nJulius Caesar also included it in his _Lex Julia de Vi_. Besides the\r\ntwo criminal prosecutions given by the Lex Cornelia and Lex Julia,\r\na person could also bring actions to recover compensation for the\r\ninjury done to his property.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCESTUM or INCESTUS. Incestum is non castum, and signifies generally\r\nall immoral and irreligious acts. In a narrower sense it denotes the\r\nunchastity of a Vestal, and sexual intercourse of persons within\r\ncertain degrees of consanguinity. Incest with a Vestal was punished\r\nwith the death of both parties. [VESTALES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINCŪNĀBŬLA or CŪNABŬLA (σπάργανον), swaddling-clothes, in which a\r\nnew-born child was wrapped. It was one of the peculiarities of the\r\nLacedaemonian education to dispense with the use of incunabula, and\r\nto allow children to enjoy the free use of their limbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Incunabula, swaddling-clothes. (From a Bas-relief at\r\nRome.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUTUS. [AMICTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFĀMĬA, was a consequence of condemnation for certain crimes,\r\nand also a direct consequence of certain acts, such as adultery,\r\nprostitution, appearing on the public stage as an actor, &c. A\r\nperson who became _infamis_ lost the suffragium and honores, and\r\nwas degraded to the condition of an aerarian. Infamia should be\r\ndistinguished from the _Nota Censoria_, the consequence of which was\r\nonly _ignominia_. [CENSOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFANS, INFANTIA. In the Roman law there were several distinctions of\r\nage which were made with reference to the capacity for doing legal\r\nacts:--1. The first period was from birth to the end of the seventh\r\nyear, during which time persons were called _Infantes_, or _Qui fari\r\nnon possunt_. 2. The second period was from the end of seven years\r\nto the end of fourteen or twelve years, according as the person was\r\na male or a female, during which persons were defined as those _Qui\r\nfari possunt_. The persons included in these first two classes were\r\n_Impuberes_. 3. The third period was from the end of the twelfth or\r\nfourteenth to the end of the twenty-fifth year, during which period\r\npersons were _Adolescentes_, _Adulti_. The persons included in these\r\nthree classes were minores xxv annis or annorum, and were often,\r\nfor brevity’s sake, called minores only [CURATOR]; and the persons\r\nincluded in the third and fourth class were _Puberes_. 4. The fourth\r\nperiod was from the age of twenty-five, during which persons were\r\n_Majores_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFĔRĬAE. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFŬLA, a flock of white and red wool, which was slightly twisted,\r\ndrawn into the form of a wreath or fillet, and used by the Romans for\r\nornament on festive and solemn occasions. In sacrificing it was tied\r\nwith a white band [VITTA] to the head of the victim and also of the\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n\r\nINGĔNŬI, were those freemen who were born free. Consequently,\r\nfreedmen (_libertini_) were not ingenui, though the sons of libertini\r\nwere ingenui; nor could a libertinus by adoption become ingenuus.\r\nThe words _ingenuus_ and _libertinus_ are often opposed to one\r\nanother; and the title of freeman (_liber_), which would comprehend\r\n_libertinus_, is sometimes limited by the addition of _ingenuus_\r\n(_liber et ingenuus_.) Under the empire a person, not ingenuus by\r\nbirth, could be made ingenuus by the emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJŪRĬA. _Injuria_, in the general sense, is opposed to _Jus_. In a\r\nspecial sense _injuria_ was done by striking or beating a man either\r\nwith the hand or with anything; by abusive words (_convicium_); by\r\nthe proscriptio bonorum, when the claimant knew that the alleged\r\ndebtor was not really indebted to him; by libellous writings or\r\nverses; by soliciting a materfamilias, &c. The Twelve Tables had\r\nvarious provisions on the subject of Injuria. Libellous songs or\r\nverses were followed by capital punishment. In the case of a limb\r\nbeing mutilated the punishment was Talio. In the case of a broken\r\nbone, the penalty was 300 asses if the injury was done to a freeman,\r\nand 150 if it was done to a slave. In other cases the Tables fixed\r\nthe penalty at 25 asses. These penalties were afterwards considered\r\nto be insufficient; and the injured person was allowed by the praetor\r\nto claim such damages as he thought that he was entitled to, and the\r\njudex might give the full amount or less. Infamia was a consequence\r\nof condemnation in an actio Injuriarum.\r\n\r\n\r\nĪNŌA (ἰνῶα), festivals celebrated in several parts of Greece, in\r\nhonour of Ino.\r\n\r\n\r\nINQUĬLĪNUS. [EXSILIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTĬTA (περιπόδιον), a flounce; a fillet. The Roman matrons\r\nsometimes wore a broad fillet with ample folds, sewed to the bottom\r\nof the tunic and reaching to the instep. The use of it indicated a\r\nsuperior regard to decency and propriety of manners.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSŬLA was, properly, a house not joined to the neighbouring houses\r\nby a common wall. An insula, however, generally contained several\r\nseparate houses, or at least separate apartments or shops, which\r\nwere let to different families; and hence the word _domus_ under\r\nthe emperors seems to be applied to the house where a family lived,\r\nwhether it were an insula or not, and insula to any hired lodgings.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERCESSĬO was the interference of a magistrates to whom an appeal\r\n[APPELLATIO] was made. The object of the intercessio was to put a\r\nstop to proceedings, on the ground of informality or other sufficient\r\ncause. Any magistratus might _intercedere_, who was of equal rank\r\nwith or of rank superior to the magistratus from or against whom\r\nthe appellatio was. Cases occur in which one of the praetors\r\ninterposed (_intercessit_) against the proceedings of his colleague.\r\nThe intercessio is most frequently spoken of with reference to\r\nthe tribunes, who originally had not jurisdictio, but used the\r\nintercessio for the purpose of preventing wrong which was offered to\r\na person in their presence. The intercessio of the tribunes of the\r\nplebs was auxilium, and it might be exercised either _in jure_ or\r\n_in judicio_. The tribune _qui intercessit_ could prevent a judicium\r\nfrom being instituted. The tribunes could also use the intercessio\r\nto prevent execution of a judicial sentence. A single tribune could\r\neffect this, and against the opinion of his colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERCĪSI DĬES. [DIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERDICTUM. “In certain cases (_certis ex causis_) the praetor or\r\nproconsul, in the first instance (_principaliter_), exercises his\r\nauthority for the termination of disputes. This he chiefly does\r\nwhen the dispute is about possession or quasi-possession; and the\r\nexercise of his authority consists in ordering something to be done,\r\nor forbidding something to be done. The formulae and the terms,\r\nwhich he uses on such occasions, are called either _interdicta_ or\r\n_decreta_. They are called _decreta_ when he orders something to be\r\ndone, as when he orders something to be produced (_exhiberi_) or to\r\nbe restored: they are called _interdicta_ when he forbids something\r\nto be done, as when he orders that force shall not be used against\r\na person who is in possession rightfully (_sine vitio_), or that\r\nnothing shall be done on a piece of sacred ground. Accordingly all\r\ninterdicta are either restitutoria, or exhibitoria, or prohibitoria.”\r\nThis passage, which is taken from Gaius, the Roman jurist, contains\r\nthe essential distinction between an _actio_ and an _interdictum_.\r\nIn the case of an actio, the praetor pronounces no order or decree,\r\nbut he gives a judex, whose business it is to investigate the\r\nmatter in dispute, and to pronounce a sentence consistently with\r\nthe formula, which is his authority for acting. In the case of an\r\nactio, therefore, the praetor neither orders nor forbids a thing to\r\nbe done, but he says, _Judicium dabo_. In the case of an interdict,\r\nthe praetor makes an order that something shall be done or shall not\r\nbe done, and his words are accordingly words of command; _Restituas,\r\nExhibeas, Vim fieri veto_. This _immediate_ interposition of the\r\npraetor is appropriately expressed by the word _principaliter_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERPRES, an interpreter. This class of persons became very numerous\r\nand necessary to the Romans as their empire extended. In large\r\nmercantile towns the interpreters, who formed a kind of agents\r\nthrough whom business was done, were sometimes very numerous. All\r\nRoman praetors, proconsuls, and quaestors, who were entrusted with\r\nthe administration of a province, had to carry on all their official\r\nproceedings in the Latin language, and as they could not be expected\r\nto be acquainted with the language of the provincials, they had\r\nalways among their servants [APPARITORES] one or more interpreters,\r\nwho were generally Romans, but in most cases undoubtedly freedmen.\r\nThese interpreters had not only to officiate at the conventus\r\n[CONVENTUS], but also explained to the Roman governor everything\r\nwhich the provincials might wish to be laid before him.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERREGNUM. [INTERREX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERREX. This office is said to have been instituted on the death of\r\nRomulus, when the senate wished to share the sovereign power among\r\nthemselves, instead of electing a king. For this purpose, according\r\nto Livy, the senate, which then consisted of one hundred members,\r\nwas divided into ten decuries; and from each of these decuries one\r\nsenator was nominated. These together formed a board of ten, with the\r\ntitle of _Interreges_, each of whom enjoyed in succession the regal\r\npower and its badges for five days; and if no king was appointed at\r\nthe expiration of fifty days, the rotation began anew. The period\r\nduring which they exercised their power was called an _Interregnum_.\r\nThese ten interreges were the _Decem Primi_, or ten leading senators,\r\nof whom the first was chief of the whole senate. The interreges\r\nagreed among themselves who should be proposed as king, and if the\r\nsenate approved of their choice, they summoned the assembly of the\r\ncuriae, and proposed the person whom they had previously agreed\r\nupon; the power of the curiae was confined to accepting or rejecting\r\nhim. Interreges were appointed under the republic for holding the\r\ncomitia for the election of the consuls, when the consuls, through\r\ncivil commotions or other causes, had been unable to do so in their\r\nyear of office. Each held the office for only five days, as under\r\nthe kings. The comitia were hardly ever held by the first interrex;\r\nmore usually by the second or third; but in one instance we read of\r\nan eleventh, and in another of a fourteenth interrex. The interreges\r\nunder the republic, at least from B.C. 482, were elected by the\r\nsenate from the whole body, and were not confined to the decem primi\r\nor ten chief senators, as under the kings. Plebeians, however, were\r\nnot admissible to this office; and consequently, when plebeians were\r\nadmitted into the senate, the patrician senators met without the\r\nplebeian members to elect an interrex. For this reason, as well as on\r\naccount of the influence which the interrex exerted in the election\r\nof the magistrates, we find that the tribunes of the plebs were\r\nstrongly opposed to the appointment of an interrex. The interrex had\r\njurisdictio. Interreges continued to be appointed occasionally till\r\nthe time of the second Punic war, but after that time we read of no\r\ninterrex, till the senate, by command of Sulla, created an interrex\r\nto hold the comitia for his election as dictator, B.C. 82. In B.C. 55\r\nanother interrex was appointed, to hold the comitia in which Pompey\r\nand Crassus were elected consuls; and we also read of interreges in\r\nB.C. 53 and 52, in the latter of which years an interrex held the\r\ncomitia in which Pompey was appointed sole consul.\r\n\r\n\r\nISTHMĬA (ἴσθμια), the Isthmian games, one of the four great national\r\nfestivals of the Greeks. This festival derived its name from the\r\nCorinthian isthmus, where it was held. Subsequent to the age of\r\nTheseus the Isthmia were celebrated in honour of Poseidon; and this\r\ninnovation is ascribed to Theseus himself. The celebration of the\r\nIsthmia was conducted by the Corinthians, but Theseus had reserved\r\nfor his Athenians some honourable distinctions: those Athenians who\r\nattended the Isthmia sailed across the Saronic gulf in a sacred\r\nvessel (θεωρίς), and an honorary place (προεδρία), as large as the\r\nsail of their vessel, was assigned to them during the celebration\r\nof the games. In times of war between the two states a sacred truce\r\nwas concluded, and the Athenians were invited to attend at the\r\nsolemnities. These games were celebrated regularly every other year,\r\nin the first and third years of each Olympiad. After the fall of\r\nCorinth, in 146 B.C., the Sicyonians were honoured with the privilege\r\nof conducting the Isthmian games; but when the town of Corinth was\r\nrebuilt by Julius Caesar, the right of conducting the solemnities\r\nwas restored to the Corinthians. The season of the Isthmian\r\nsolemnities was, like that of all the great national festivals,\r\ndistinguished by general rejoicings and feasting. The contests and\r\ngames of the Isthmia were the same as those at Olympia, and embraced\r\nall the varieties of athletic performances, such as wrestling,\r\nthe pancratium, together with horse and chariot racing. Musical\r\nand poetical contests were likewise carried on, and in the latter\r\nwomen were also allowed to take part. The prize of a victor in the\r\nIsthmian games consisted at first of a garland of pine-leaves, and\r\nafterwards of a wreath of ivy. Simple as such a reward was, a victor\r\nin these games gained the greatest distinction and honour among\r\nhis countrymen; and a victory not only rendered the individual who\r\nobtained it a subject of admiration, but shed lustre over his family,\r\nand the whole town or community to which he belonged. Hence Solon\r\nestablished by a law, that every Athenian who gained the victory at\r\nthe Isthmian games should receive from the public treasury a reward\r\nof one hundred drachmae. His victory was generally celebrated in\r\nlofty odes, called Epinikia, or triumphal odes, of which we still\r\npossess some beautiful specimens among the poems of Pindar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJĂCŬLUM. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJĀNŬA (θύρα), a door. Besides being applicable to the doors of\r\napartments in the interior of a house, which were properly called\r\n_ostia_, this term more especially denoted the first entrance into\r\nthe house, _i.e._ the front or street door, which was also called\r\n_anticum_, and in Greek θύρα αὔλειος, αὐλεία, αὔλιος, or αὐλία. The\r\nhouses of the Romans commonly had a back door, called _posticum_,\r\n_postica_, or _posticula_, and in Greek παράθυρα, _dim._ παραθύριον.\r\nThe door-way, when complete, consisted of four indispensable\r\nparts; the threshold, or sill (_limen_, βηλός, οὖδας); the lintel\r\n(_jugumentum, limen superum_); and the two jambs (_postes_, σταθμοί).\r\nThe door itself was called _foris_ or _valva_, and in Greek σανίς,\r\nκλισιάς, or θύρετρον. These words are commonly found in the plural,\r\nbecause the door-way of every building of the least importance\r\ncontained two doors folding together. When _foris_ is used in the\r\nsingular, it denotes one of the folding doors only. The fastenings\r\nof the door (_claustra_, _obices_) commonly consisted of a bolt\r\n(_pessulus_; μάνδαλος, κατοχεύς, κλεῖθρον) placed at the base of each\r\n_foris_, so as to admit of being pushed into a socket made in the\r\nsill to receive it. By night, the front-door of the house was further\r\nsecured by means of a wooden and sometimes an iron bar (_sera_,\r\n_repagula_, μοχλός) placed across it, and inserted into sockets on\r\neach side of the door-way. Hence it was necessary to remove the bar\r\n(τὸν μοχλὸν παράφερειν) in order to open the door (_reserare_). It\r\nwas considered improper to enter a house without giving notice to its\r\ninmates. This notice the Spartans gave by shouting; the Athenians and\r\nall other nations by using the knocker, or more commonly by rapping\r\nwith the knuckles or with a stick (κρούειν, κόπτειν). In the houses\r\nof the rich a porter (_janitor_, _custos_, θυρωρός) was always in\r\nattendance to open the door. He was commonly an eunuch or a slave,\r\nand was chained to his post. To assist him in guarding the entrance,\r\na dog was universally kept near it, being also attached by a chain\r\nto the wall; and in reference to this practice, the warning _cave\r\ncanem_, εὐλαβοῦ τὴν κύνα, was sometimes written near the door. The\r\nappropriate name for the portion of the house immediately behind the\r\ndoor (θυρών) denotes that it was a kind of apartment; it corresponded\r\nto the hall or lobby of our houses. Immediately adjoining it, and\r\nclose to the front door, there was in many houses a small room for\r\nthe porter.\r\n\r\n\r\nJENTĀCŬLUM. [COENA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJŪDEX, JŪDĬCĬUM. A Roman magistratus generally did not investigate\r\nthe facts in dispute in such matters as were brought before him:\r\nhe appointed a judex for that purpose, and gave him instructions.\r\n[ACTIO.] Accordingly, the whole of civil procedure was expressed\r\nby the two phrases _Jus_ and _Judicium_, of which the former\r\ncomprehended all that took place before the magistratus (_in\r\njure_), and the latter all that took place before the judex (_in\r\njudicio_). In many cases a single judex was appointed: in others,\r\nseveral were appointed, and they seem to have been sometimes\r\ncalled recuperatores, as opposed to the single judex. Under certain\r\ncircumstances the judex was called arbiter: thus judex and arbiter\r\nare named together in the Twelve Tables. A judex when appointed was\r\nbound to discharge the functions of the office, unless he had some\r\nvalid excuse (_excusatio_). There were certain seasons of the year\r\nwhen legal business was done at Rome, and at these times the services\r\nof the judices were required. These legal terms were regulated\r\naccording to the seasons, so that there were periods of vacation.\r\nWhen the judex was appointed, the proceedings _in jure_ or before the\r\npraetor were terminated. The parties appeared before the judex on\r\nthe third day (_comperendinatio_), unless the praetor had deferred\r\nthe judicium for some sufficient reason. The judex was generally\r\naided by advisers (_jurisconsulti_) learned in the law, who were\r\nsaid _in consilio adesse_; but the judex alone was empowered to give\r\njudgment. The matter was first briefly stated to the judex (_causae\r\nconjectio, collectio_), and the advocates of each party supported\r\nhis cause in a speech. Witnesses were produced on both sides, and\r\nexamined orally: the witnesses on one side were also cross-examined\r\nby the other. After all the evidence was given and the advocates had\r\nfinished, the judex gave sentence: if there were several judices, a\r\nmajority decided. If the matter was one of difficulty, the hearing\r\nmight be adjourned as often as was necessary (_ampliatio_); and if\r\nthe judex could not come to a satisfactory conclusion, he might\r\ndeclare this upon oath, and so release himself from the difficulty.\r\nThis was done by the form of words _non liquere_ (N. L.). The\r\nsentence was pronounced orally, and was sometimes first written on a\r\ntablet. If the defendant did not make his appearance after being duly\r\nsummoned, judgment might be given against him.--According to Cicero,\r\nall judicia had for their object, either the settlement of disputes\r\nbetween individuals (_controversiae_), or the punishment of crimes\r\n(_maleficia_). This refers to a division of judicia, which appears\r\nin the jurists, into _judicia publica_ and _judicia privata_. The\r\nformer, the _judicia publica_, succeeded to the _judicia populi_ of\r\nthe early republican period: the latter were so called because in\r\nthem the populus acted as judices. Originally the kings presided in\r\nall criminal cases, and the consuls succeeded to their authority. But\r\nafter the passing of the Lex Valeria (B.C. 507), which gave an appeal\r\nto the populus (that is, the comitia curiata) from the magistratus,\r\nthe consul could not sit in judgment on the caput of a Roman\r\ncitizen, but such cases were tried in the comitia, or persons were\r\nappointed to preside at such inquiries, who were accordingly called\r\n_Quaesitores_ or _Quaestores parricidii_ or _rerum capitalium_. In\r\ncourse of time, as such cases became of more frequent occurrence,\r\nsuch quaestiones were made perpetual, that is, particular magistrates\r\nwere appointed for the purpose. It was eventually determined,\r\nthat while the _praetor urbanus_ and _peregrinus_ should continue\r\nto exercise their usual jurisdictions, the other praetors should\r\npreside at public trials. In such trials any person might be an\r\naccuser (_accusator_). The praetor generally presided as quaesitor,\r\nassisted by a judex quaestionis, and a body of judices called his\r\nconsilium. The judices were generally chosen by lot out of those who\r\nwere qualified to act; but in some cases the accuser and the accused\r\n(_reus_) had the privilege of choosing (_edere_) a certain number of\r\njudices out of a large number, who were thence called _Edititii_.\r\nBoth the accusator and the reus had the privilege of rejecting or\r\nchallenging (_rejicere_) such judices as they did not like. In many\r\ncases a lex was passed for the purpose of regulating the mode of\r\nprocedure.--The judices voted by ballot, at least generally, and a\r\nmajority determined the acquittal or condemnation of the accused.\r\nEach judex was provided with three tablets (_tabulae_), on one of\r\nwhich was marked A, _Absolvo_; on a second C, _Condemno_; and on\r\na third N. L., _Non liquet_. The judices voted by placing one of\r\nthese tablets in the urns, which were then examined for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining the votes. It was the duty of the magistratus to\r\npronounce the sentence of the judices; in the case of condemnation,\r\nto adjudge the legal penalty; of acquittal, to declare the accused\r\nacquitted; and of doubt, to declare that the matter must be further\r\ninvestigated (_amplius cognoscendum_).--A _judicium populi_, properly\r\nso called, was one in which the case was tried in the comitia\r\ncuriata, but afterwards in the comitia centuriata and tributa.\r\nThe accuser, who must be a magistratus, commenced by declaring in\r\na contio that he would on a certain day accuse a certain person,\r\nwhom he named, of some offence, which he also specified. This was\r\nexpressed by the phrase _diem dicere_. If the offender held any\r\nhigh office, it was necessary to wait till his time of service had\r\nexpired, before proceedings could be thus commenced against him. The\r\naccused was required to give security for his appearance on the day\r\nof trial; the security was called _vades_ in a causa capitalis, and\r\n_praedes_ when the penalty for the alleged offence was pecuniary. If\r\nsuch security was not given, the accused was kept in confinement. If\r\nnothing prevented the inquiry from taking place at the time fixed for\r\nit, the trial proceeded, and the accuser had to prove his case by\r\nevidence. The investigation of the facts was called _anquisitio_ with\r\nreference to the proposed penalty: accordingly, the phrases _pecunia,\r\ncapite_ or _capitis anquirere_, are used. When the investigation was\r\nconcluded, the magistratus promulgated a rogatio, which comprehended\r\nthe charge and the punishment or fine. It was a rule of law that a\r\nfine should not be imposed together with another punishment in the\r\nsame rogatio. The rogatio was made public during three nundinae, like\r\nany other lex, and proposed at the comitia for adoption or rejection.\r\nThe accused sometimes withdrew into exile before the votes were\r\ntaken; or he might make his defence. The offences which were the\r\nchief subject of judicia populi and publica were majestas, adulteria\r\nand stupra, parricidium, falsum, vis publica and privata, peculatus,\r\nrepetundae, ambitus.--With the passing of special enactments for\r\nthe punishment of particular offences, was introduced the practice\r\nof forming a body of judices for the trial of such offences as the\r\nenactments were directed against. The _Album Judicum_ was the body\r\nout of which judices were to be chosen. It is not known what was\r\nthe number of the body so constituted, but it has been conjectured\r\nthat the number was 350, and that ten were chosen from each tribe,\r\nand thus the origin of the phrase _Decuriae Judicum_ is explained.\r\nIt is easy to conceive that the judicia populi, properly so called,\r\nwould be less frequent, as special leges were framed for particular\r\noffences, the circumstances of which could be better investigated\r\nby a smaller body of judices than by the assembled people. The Lex\r\nServilia (B.C. 104) enacted that the judices should not be under\r\nthirty nor above sixty years of age, that the accuser and accused\r\nshould severally propose one hundred judices, and that each might\r\nreject fifty from the list of the other, so that one hundred would\r\nremain for the trial. Up to B.C. 122 the judices were always\r\nsenators, but in this year the Sempronia Lex of C. Gracchus took the\r\njudicia from the senators and gave them to the equites. This state\r\nof things lasted nearly fifty years, till Sulla (B.C. 80) restored\r\nthe judicia to the senate, and excluded the equites from the album\r\njudicum. A Lex Aurelia (B.C. 70) enacted that the judices should be\r\nchosen from the three classes--of senators, equites, and tribuni\r\naerarii; and accordingly the judicia were then said to be divided\r\nbetween the senate and the equites. The tribuni aerarii were taken\r\nfrom the rest of the citizens, and were, or ought to have been,\r\npersons of some property. Thus the three decuriae of judices were\r\nformed; and it was either in consequence of the Lex Aurelia or the\r\nLex Fufia that, instead of one urn for all the tablets, the decuriae\r\nhad severally their balloting urn, so that the votes of the three\r\nclasses were known. It is not known if the Lex Aurelia determined the\r\nnumber of judices in any given case. The Lex Pompeia de Vi and De\r\nAmbitu (B.C. 52) determined that eighty judices were to be selected\r\nby lot, out of whom the accuser and the accused might reject thirty.\r\nIn the case of Clodius, in the matter of the Bona Dea, there were\r\nfifty-six judices. It is conjectured that the number fixed for a\r\ngiven case, by the Lex Aurelia, was seventy judices. Augustus added\r\nto the existing three decuriae judicum a fourth decuria, called that\r\nof the _Ducenarii_, who had a lower pecuniary qualification, and only\r\ndecided in smaller matters. Caligula added a fifth decuria, in order\r\nto diminish the labours of the judices.\r\n\r\n\r\nJŪGĔRUM, a Roman measure of surface, 240 feet in length and 120 in\r\nbreadth, containing therefore 28,800 square feet. It was the double\r\nof the _Actus Quadratus_, and from this circumstance, according to\r\nsome writers, it derived its name. [ACTUS.] The uncial division [AS]\r\nwas applied to the _jugerum_, its smallest part being the _scrupulum_\r\nof 10 feet square, = 100 square feet. Thus the _jugerum_ contained\r\n288 scrupula. The jugerum was the common measure of land among the\r\nRomans. Two _jugera_ formed an _heredium_, a hundred _heredia_ a\r\n_centuria_, and four _centuriae_ a _saltus_. These divisions were\r\nderived from the original assignment of landed property, in which two\r\n_jugera_ were given to each citizen as heritable property.\r\n\r\n\r\nJŬGUM (ζυγός, ζυγόν), signified in general that which joined two\r\nthings together, such as the transverse beam which united the upright\r\nposts of a loom, the cross-bar of a lyre, a scale-beam, &c., but\r\nit denoted more especially the yoke by which ploughs and carriages\r\nwere drawn. The following woodcut shows two examples of the yoke:\r\nthe upper one is provided with two collars, the lower one with\r\nexcavations cut in the yoke, in order to give more ease and freedom\r\nto the animals. The latter figure shows the method of tying the\r\nyoke to the pole (_temo_, ῥυμός) by means of a leathern strap. The\r\nword jugum is often used to signify _slavery_, or the condition in\r\nwhich men are compelled, against their will, like oxen or horses, to\r\nlabour for others. Hence, to express symbolically the subjugation\r\nof conquered nations, the Romans made their captives pass under a\r\nyoke (_sub jugum mittere_), which, however, was not made like the\r\nyoke used in drawing carriages or ploughs, but consisted of a spear\r\nsupported transversely by two others placed upright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jugum, yoke.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJŪRISCONSULTI or JŪRĔCONSULTI arose among the Romans after the\r\nseparation of the Jus Civile from the Jus Pontificium. Such a body\r\ncertainly existed before the time of Cicero, and the persons who\r\nprofessed to expound the law were called by the various names of\r\n_jurisperiti_, _jurisconsulti_, or _consulti_ simply. They were also\r\ndesignated by other names, as _jurisprudentes_, _prudentiores_,\r\n_peritiores_, and _juris auctores_. The business of the early\r\njurisconsulti consisted both in advising and acting on behalf of\r\ntheir clients (_consultores_) gratuitously. They gave their advice\r\nor answers (_responsa_) either in public places which they attended\r\nat certain times, or at their own houses; and not only on matters\r\nof law, but on any thing else that might be referred to them. The\r\nwords _scribere_ and _cavere_ referred to their employment in\r\ndrawing up formal instruments, such as contracts or wills, &c. At a\r\nlater period, many of these functions were performed by persons who\r\nwere paid by a fee, and thus there arose a body of practitioners\r\ndistinct from those who gave responsa and who were writers and\r\nteachers. Tiberius Coruncanius, a plebeian, who was consul B.C. 281,\r\nand also the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus, is mentioned as the\r\nfirst who publicly professed (_publice professus est_), and he was\r\ndistinguished both for his knowledge of the law and his eloquence.\r\n\r\n\r\nJŪRISDICTIO, signifies generally the authority of the magistrate “qui\r\njus dicit,” and is mostly applied to the authority of the praetor in\r\ncivil cases, such as the giving of the formula in an actio and the\r\nappointment of a judex. [ACTIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJŪS. The law peculiar to the Roman state is sometimes called _Jus\r\nCivile Romanorum_, but more frequently _Jus Civile_ only. The _Jus\r\nQuiritium_ is equivalent to the _Jus Civile Romanorum_. The _jus\r\ncivil_e of the Romans is divisible into two parts, _jus civile_ in\r\nthe narrower sense, and _jus pontificium_, or the law of religion.\r\nThis opposition is sometimes expressed by the words _Jus_ and _Fas_.\r\nThe law of religion, or the _Jus Pontificium_, was under the control\r\nof the pontifices, who in fact originally had the control of the\r\nwhole mass of the law; and it was only after the separation of the\r\njus civile in its wider sense into the two parts of the jus civile,\r\nin its narrower sense, and the jus pontificium, that each part had\r\nits proper and peculiar limits. Still, even after the separation,\r\nthere was a mutual relation between these two branches of law; for\r\ninstance, an adrogatio was not valid by the jus civile unless it was\r\nvalid by the jus pontificium. Again, jus pontificium, in its wider\r\nsense, as the law of religion, had its subdivisions, as into jus\r\naugurum, pontificium, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nJŪS CĪVĪLE. [JUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJŪS LĂTĪI. [CIVITAS; LATINITAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUS PONTĬFĬCĬUM. [JUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUS QUĬRĪTĬUM. [JUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSJŪRANDUM (ὅρκος), an oath. (1) GREEK. An oath is an appeal to\r\nsome superior being, calling on him to bear witness that the swearer\r\nspeaks the truth, or intends to perform the promise which he makes.\r\nWe find early mention in the Greek writers of oaths being taken\r\non solemn and important occasions, as treaties, alliances, vows,\r\ncompacts, and agreements, both between nations and individuals.\r\nThe Greeks paid high regard to the sanctity of oaths. The poets\r\nfrequently allude to the punishment of perjury after death, which\r\nthey assign to the infernal gods or furies, and we find many proofs\r\nof a persuasion that perjurers would not prosper in this world.\r\nAnciently the person who took an oath stood up, and lifted his hands\r\nto heaven, as he would in prayer; for an oath was a species of\r\nprayer, and required the same sort of ceremony. Oaths were frequently\r\naccompanied with sacrifice or libation. The parties used also to\r\nlay their hands upon the victims, or on the altar or some other\r\nsacred thing, as if by so doing they brought before them the deity\r\nby whom the oath was sworn, and made him witness of the ceremony.\r\nHence the expressions πρὸς τὸν βωμὸν ἐξορκίζειν, ὀμνύναι καθ’\r\nἱερῶν. The hand especially was regarded as a pledge of fidelity,\r\nand the allusions to the junction of hands in making contracts and\r\nagreements abound in the ancient writers. The different nations of\r\nGreece swore by their own peculiar gods and heroes; as the Thebans\r\nby Hercules, Iolaus, &c., the Lacedaemonians by Castor and Pollux,\r\nthe Corinthians by Poseidon; the Athenians swore principally by Zeus,\r\nAthena, Apollo (their πατρῷος θεὸς), Demeter, and Dionysus. The\r\noffice or character of the party, or the place, or the occasion often\r\nsuggested the oath to be taken. As swearing became a common practice\r\nwith men upon trivial occasions, and in ordinary conversation, they\r\nused to take oaths by any god, person, or thing, as their peculiar\r\nhabits or predilections, or the fancy of the moment, dictated. Women\r\nalso had their favourite oaths. As the men preferred swearing by\r\nHercules, Apollo, &c., so the other sex used to swear by Aphrodite,\r\nDemeter, and Persephone, Hera, Hecate, Artemis; and Athenian women by\r\nAglauros, Pandrosus, &c.--(2) ROMAN. I. _Oaths taken by magistrates\r\nand other persons who entered the service of the republic._--After\r\nthe establishment of the republic the consuls, and subsequently all\r\nthe other magistrates, were obliged, within five days after their\r\nappointment, to promise on oath that they would protect and observe\r\nthe laws of the republic (_in leges jurare_). Vestal virgins and the\r\nflamen dialis were not allowed to swear on any occasion. During the\r\nlater period of the republic we also find that magistrates, when the\r\ntime of their office had expired, addressed the people and swore that\r\nduring their office they had undertaken nothing against the republic,\r\nbut had done their utmost to promote its welfare. All Roman soldiers\r\nafter they were enlisted for a campaign, had to take the military\r\noath (_sacramentum_). It may here be remarked that any oath might be\r\ntaken in two ways: the person who took it, either framed it himself,\r\nor it was put to him in a set form, and in this case he was said\r\nin _verba jurare_, or _jurare verbis conceptis_.--II. _Oaths taken\r\nin transactions with foreign nations in the name of the republic._\r\nAccording to the most ancient form the pater patratus pronounced\r\nthe oath in the name of his country, and struck the victim with a\r\nflint-stone, calling on Jupiter to destroy the Roman nation in like\r\nmanner, as he (the pater patratus) destroyed the animal, if the\r\npeople should violate the oath. The chiefs or priests of the other\r\nnation then swore in a similar manner by their own gods. In swearing\r\nto a treaty with a foreign nation, a victim (a pig or a lamb) was\r\nin the early times always sacrificed by the fetialis (whence the\r\nexpressions _foedus icere_, ὅρκια τέμνειν), and the priest while\r\npronouncing the oath probably touched the victim or the altar. The\r\njus fetiale, however, fell into disuse as the Romans extended their\r\nconquests; and as in most cases of treaties with foreign nations, the\r\nRomans were not the party that chose to promise anything on oath, we\r\nhear no more of oaths on their part. At first the Romans were very\r\nscrupulous in observing their oaths in contracts or treaties with\r\nforeigners, and even with enemies; but from the third Punic war to\r\nthe end of the republic, perjury was common among the Romans in their\r\ndealings with foreigners as well as among themselves.--III. _Oaths or\r\nvarious modes of swearing in common life._ The practice of swearing\r\nin ordinary conversations, was as common among the Romans as among\r\nthe Greeks. The forms used were sometimes simple invocations of one\r\nor more gods, as _Hercle_ or _Mehercle_, that is, ita me Hercules\r\njuvet, amet, or servet; _Pol_, _Perpol_ or _Aedepol_, that is, per\r\nPollucem; _per Jovem Lapidem_ or simply _per Jovem_; _per superos_;\r\n_per deos immortales_; _medius fidius_, that is, ita me Dius (Δίος)\r\nfilius juvet; _ita me deus amet_, or _dii ament_. Women as well as\r\nmen swore by most of the gods; but some oaths were peculiar to one\r\nof the sexes. Thus women never swore by Hercules, and men never by\r\nCastor. Sometimes oaths were accompanied with an execration, in case\r\nthe swearer was stating a falsehood: as _Dii me perdant_; _dii me\r\ninterficiant_; _dispeream_; _ne vivam_; _ne salvus sim_, &c.--IV.\r\n_Oaths taken before the praetor or in courts of justice._ There might\r\nbe a _jusjurandum_ either _in jure_ or _in judicio_. The _jusjurandum\r\nin jure_ is the oath which one party proposed to his adversary\r\n(_detulit_) that he should make about the matter in dispute; and\r\nthe effect of the oath being taken or refused was equivalent to a\r\njudicium. The _jusjurandum in judicio (jusjurandum judiciale)_ was\r\nrequired by the judex, and not by either of the parties, though\r\neither of the parties might suggest it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTĬTĬUM, a cessation of public business of every kind. Thus the\r\ncourts of law and the treasury were shut up, no ambassadors were\r\nreceived in the senate, and no auctions took place. The _Justitium_\r\nwas proclaimed (_edicere_, _indicere_) by the senate and the\r\nmagistrates in times of public alarm and danger; and after confidence\r\nand tranquillity had been restored, the Justitium was removed\r\n(_remittere_, _exuere_) by the same authorities. As such times of\r\nalarm are usually accompanied with general sorrow, a _Justitium_\r\ncame in course of time to be ordained as a mark of public mourning,\r\nand under the empire was only employed for this reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nJŬVĔNĀLĬA, or JŬVĔNĀLES LŪDI, scenic games instituted by Nero, in\r\nA.D. 59, in commemoration of his shaving his beard for the first\r\ntime, thus intimating that he had passed from youth to manhood. He\r\nwas then in the twenty-second year of his age. These games were not\r\ncelebrated in the circus, but in a private theatre erected in a\r\npleasure-ground (_nemus_), and consisted of every kind of theatrical\r\nperformance, Greek and Roman plays, mimetic pieces, and the like. The\r\nJuvenalia continued to be celebrated by subsequent emperors, but not\r\non the same occasion. The name was given to those games which were\r\nexhibited by the emperors on the 1st of January in each year. They no\r\nlonger consisted of scenic representations, but of chariot races and\r\ncombats of wild beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂBĂRUM. [SIGNA MILITARIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂBRUM. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂBỸRINTHUS (λαβύρινθος), a labyrinth, a large and complicated\r\nsubterraneous cavern with numerous and intricate passages, similar\r\nto those of a mine. The earliest and most renowned labyrinth was\r\nthat of Egypt, which lay beyond lake Moeris. It had 3000 apartments,\r\n1500 under ground, and the same number above it, and the whole was\r\nsurrounded by a wall. It was divided into courts, each of which\r\nwas surrounded by colonnades of white marble. The second labyrinth\r\nmentioned by the ancients was that of Crete, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Cnossus, where the Minotaur is said to have dwelt. Although the\r\nCretan labyrinth is very frequently mentioned by ancient authors,\r\nyet none of them speaks of it as an eyewitness. It was probably some\r\nnatural cavern in the neighbourhood of Cnossus. A third labyrinth,\r\nthe construction of which belongs to a more historical age, was\r\nthat in the island of Lemnos. A fabulous edifice in Etruria is also\r\nmentioned, to which Pliny applies the name of labyrinth. It is\r\ndescribed as being in the neighbourhood of Clusium, and as the tomb\r\nof Lar Porsena; but no writer says that he ever saw it, or remains of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂCERNA (μανδύας, μανδύη), a cloak worn by the Romans over the toga.\r\nIt differed from the paenula in being an open garment like the Greek\r\npallium, and fastened on the right shoulder by means of a buckle\r\n(_fibula_), whereas the paenula was what is called a _vestimentum\r\nclausum_ with an opening for the head. The Lacerna appears to have\r\nbeen commonly used in the army. In the time of Cicero it was not\r\nusually worn in the city, but it soon afterwards became quite common\r\nat Rome. The lacerna was sometimes thrown over the head for the\r\npurpose of concealment; but a _cucullus_ or cowl was generally used\r\nfor that purpose, which appears to have been frequently attached to\r\nthe lacerna, and to have formed a part of the dress.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂCĬNĬAE, the angular extremities of the toga, one of which was\r\nbrought round over the left shoulder. It was generally tucked into\r\nthe girdle, but sometimes was allowed to hang down loose.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂCŌNĬCUM. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂCŪNAR. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂCUS. [FONS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAENA (χλαῖνα), a woollen cloak, the cloth of which was twice the\r\nordinary thickness, shaggy upon both sides, and worn over the pallium\r\nor the toga for the sake of warmth. In later times the laena seems,\r\nto a certain extent, to have been worn as a substitute for the toga.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMPĂDĒPHŎRĬA (λαμπαδηφορία), _torch-bearing_, LAMPADEDROMIA\r\n(λαμπαδηδρομία), _torch-race_, and often simply LAMPAS (λαμπάς),\r\nwas a game common throughout Greece. At Athens we know of five\r\ncelebrations of this game: one to Prometheus at the Prometheia, a\r\nsecond to Athena at the Panathenaca, a third to Hephaestos at the\r\nHephaesteia, a fourth to Pan, and a fifth to the Thracian Artemis\r\nor Bendis. The first three are of unknown antiquity; the fourth was\r\nintroduced soon after the battle of Marathon; the last in the time of\r\nSocrates. The race was usually run on foot, horses being first used\r\nin the time of Socrates; sometimes also at night. The preparation for\r\nit was a principal branch of the _Gymnasiarchia_, so much so indeed\r\nin later times, that the _Lampadarchia_ (λαμπαδαρχία) seems to have\r\nbeen pretty much equivalent to the _Gymnasiarchia_. The gymnasiarch\r\nhad to provide the lampas, which was a candlestick with a kind of\r\nshield set at the bottom of the socket, so as to shelter the flame of\r\nthe candle; as is seen in the following woodcut, taken from a coin.\r\nHe had also to provide for the training of the runners, which was\r\nof no slight consequence, for the race was evidently a severe one,\r\nwith other expenses, which on the whole were very heavy, so that\r\nIsaeus classes this office with the _choregia_ and _trierarchia_, and\r\nreckons that it had cost him 12 minae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lampae. (From a Coin.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMPAS. [LAMPADEPHORIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLANCĔA. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂNISTA. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLANX, a large dish, made of silver or some other metal, and sometimes\r\nembossed, used at splendid entertainments to hold meat or fruit; and\r\nconsequently at sacrifices and funeral banquets.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPHRĬA (Λάφρια), an annual festival, celebrated at Patrae in Achaia,\r\nin honour of Artemis, surnamed Laphria.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂPĬCĪDĪNAE. [LAUTUMIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂQUĔAR. [DOMUS, p. 144, _b._]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂQŬEĀTŌRES. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂQUĔUS, a rope, was used to signify the punishment of death by\r\nstrangling. This mode of execution was never performed in public,\r\nbut only in prison and generally in the Tullianum. Hence we find the\r\nwords _carcer_ and _laqueus_ frequently joined together. Persons\r\nconvicted of treason were most frequently put to death by strangling,\r\nas for instance the Catilinarian conspirators (_laqueo gulam\r\nfregere_).\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂRĀRĬUM, a place in the inner part of a Roman house, which was\r\ndedicated to the Lares, and in which their images were kept and\r\nworshipped. It seems to have been customary for religious Romans in\r\nthe morning, immediately after they rose, to perform their prayers in\r\nthe lararium.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĀRENTĀLĬA, sometimes written LĀRENTINĀLIA and LAURENTĀLIA, a Roman\r\nfestival in honour of Acca Larentia, the wife of Faustulus and the\r\nnurse of Romulus and Remus. It was celebrated in December, on the\r\n10th before the calends of January.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGĪTĬO. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂTER πλίνθος, a brick. The Romans distinguished between those bricks\r\nwhich were merely dried by the sun and air (_lateres crudi_), and\r\nthose which were burnt in the kiln (_cocti_ or _coctiles_). They\r\npreferred for brick making clay which was either whitish or decidedly\r\nred. Pliny calls the brickfield _lateraria_, and to make bricks\r\n_lateres ducere_, corresponding to the Greek πλίνθους ἕλκειν or\r\nἔρυειν.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĀTĬCLĀVĬI. [CLAVUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂTĪNAE FĔRĬAE. [FERIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂTĪNĬTAS, LĂTĬUM, JUS LĂTĬI. All these expressions are used to\r\nsignify a certain status intermediate between that of cives and\r\nperegrini. Before the passing of the Lex Julia de Civitate (B.C.\r\n90) the above expressions denoted a certain nationality, and as part\r\nof it a certain legal status with reference to Rome; but after the\r\npassing of that lex, these expressions denoted only a certain status,\r\nand had no reference to any national distinction. About the year\r\nB.C. 89, a Lex Pompeia gave the jus Latii to all the Transpadani,\r\nand consequently the privilege of obtaining the Roman civitas by\r\nhaving filled a magistratus in their own cities. To denote the status\r\nof these Transpadani, the word Latinitas was used, which since the\r\npassing of the Lex Julia had lost its proper signification; and this\r\nwas the origin of that Latinitas which thenceforth existed to the\r\ntime of Justinian. This new Latinitas or jus Latii was given to whole\r\ntowns and countries; as, for instance, by Vespasian to the whole of\r\nSpain. It is not certain wherein this new Latinitas differed from\r\nthat Latinitas which was the characteristic of the Latini before the\r\npassing of the Lex Julia. It is, however, clear that all the old\r\nLatini had not the same right with respect to Rome; and that they\r\ncould acquire the civitas on easier terms than those by which the new\r\nLatinitas was acquired.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĂTRUNCŬLI (πεσσοί, ψήφοι), draughts. The invention of a game\r\nresembling draughts was attributed by the Greeks to Palamedes;\r\nand it is mentioned by Homer. There were two sets of men, one set\r\nbeing black, the other white or red. Being intended to represent\r\na miniature combat between two armies, they were called soldiers\r\n(_milites_), foes (_hostes_), and marauders (_latrones_, dim.\r\n_latrunculi_); also _calculi_, because stones were often employed for\r\nthe purpose. The Romans often had twelve lines on the draught-board,\r\nwhence the game so played was called _duodecim scripta_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUDĀTĬO. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURENTĀLĬA. [LARENTALIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUTŬMĬAE, LAUTŎMIAE, LĀTOMIAE, Or LĀTUMIAE (λιθοτομίαι,\r\nλατομίαι,Lat. _Lapicidinae_), literally places where stones are cut,\r\nor quarries, and more particularly the public prison of Syracuse. It\r\nlay in the steep and almost inaccessible part of the town which was\r\ncalled Epipolae, and had been built by Dionysius the tyrant. It was\r\ncut to an immense depth into the solid rock, so that nothing could be\r\nimagined to be a safer or stronger prison, though it had no roof, and\r\nthus left the prisoners exposed to the heat of the sun, the rain, and\r\nthe coldness of the nights. The Tullianum at Rome was also sometimes\r\ncalled lautumiae. [CARCER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTICA (κλίνη, κλινίδιον, or φορεῖον), was a kind of couch or\r\nlitter, in which persons, in a lying position, were carried from one\r\nplace to another. Lecticae were used for carrying the dead [FUNUS] as\r\nwell as the living. The Greek lectica consisted of a bed or mattress,\r\nand a pillow to support the head, placed upon a kind of bedstead or\r\ncouch. It had a roof, consisting of the skin of an ox, extending over\r\nthe couch and resting on four posts. The sides of this lectica were\r\ncovered with curtains. In the republican period it appears to have\r\nbeen chiefly used by women, and by men only when they were in ill\r\nhealth. When this kind of lectica was introduced among the Romans,\r\nit was chiefly used in travelling, and very seldom in Rome itself.\r\nBut towards the end of the republic, and under the empire, it was\r\ncommonly used in the city, and was fitted up in the most splendid\r\nmanner. Instead of curtains, it was frequently closed on the sides\r\nwith windows made of transparent stone (_lapis specularis_), and was\r\nprovided with a pillow and bed. When standing, it rested on four\r\nfeet, generally made of wood. Persons were carried in a lectica by\r\nslaves (_lecticarii_), by means of poles (_asseres_) attached to it,\r\nbut not fixed, so that they might easily be taken off when necessary.\r\nThe number of lecticarii employed in carrying one lectica varied\r\naccording to its size, and the display of wealth which a person\r\nmight wish to make. The ordinary number was probably two; but it\r\nvaried from two to eight, and the lectica is called _hexaphoron_ or\r\n_octophoron_, accordingly as it was carried by six or eight persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTISTERNIUM. Sacrifices being of the nature of feasts, the Greeks\r\nand Romans, on occasion of extraordinary solemnities, placed images\r\nof the gods reclining on couches, with tables and viands before them,\r\nas if they were really partaking of the things offered in sacrifice.\r\nThis ceremony was called a _lectisternium_. The woodcut here\r\nintroduced exhibits one of these couches, which is represented with\r\na cushion covered by a cloth hanging in ample folds down each side.\r\nThis beautiful _pulvinar_ is wrought altogether in white marble, and\r\nis somewhat more than two feet in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pulvinar used at Lectisternium. (From the Glyptothek\r\nat Munich.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTUS (λέχος, κλίνη, εὐνή), a bed. The complete bed (εὐνή) of a\r\nwealthy Greek in later times generally consisted of the following\r\nparts:--κλίνη, ἐπίτονοι, τυλεῖον or κνέφαλον, προσκεφάλειον, and\r\nστρώματα. The κλίνη is, properly speaking, merely the bedstead, and\r\nseems to have consisted only of posts fitted into one another and\r\nresting upon four feet. At the head part alone there was a board\r\n(ἀνάκλιντρον or ἐπίκλιντρον) to support the pillow and prevent its\r\nfalling out. Sometimes, however, the bottom part of a bedstead\r\nwas likewise protected by a board, so that in this case a Greek\r\nbedstead resembled what we call a French bedstead. The bedstead was\r\nprovided with girths (τόνοι, ἐπίτονοι, κειρία) on which the bed or\r\nmattress (κνέφαλον, τυλεῖον, or τύλη) rested. The cover or ticking\r\nof a mattress was made of linen or woollen cloth, or of leather,\r\nand the usual material with which it was filled was either wool\r\nor dried weeds. At the head part of the bed, and supported by the\r\nἐπίκλιντρον, lay a round pillow (προσκεφάλειον) to support the head.\r\nThe bed-covers (στρώματα) were generally made of cloth, which was\r\nvery thick and woolly, either on one or on both sides. The beds\r\nof the Romans (_lecti cubiculares_) in the earlier periods of the\r\nrepublic were probably of the same description as those used in\r\nGreece; but towards the end of the republic and during the empire,\r\nthe richness and magnificence of the beds of the wealthy Romans far\r\nsurpassed every thing we find described in Greece. The bedstead was\r\ngenerally rather high, so that persons entered the bed (_scandere_,\r\n_ascendere_) by means of steps placed beside it (_scamnum_). It was\r\nsometimes made of metal, and sometimes of costly kinds of wood,\r\nor veneered with tortoise-shell or ivory; its feet (_fulcra_)\r\nwere frequently of silver or gold. The bed or mattress (_culcita_\r\nand _torus_) rested upon girths or strings (_restes_, _fasciae_,\r\n_institae_, or _funes_), which connected the two horizontal\r\nside-posts of the bed. In beds destined for two persons the two sides\r\nare distinguished by different names; the side at which persons\r\nentered was open, and bore the name _sponda_; the other side, which\r\nwas protected by a board, was called _pluteus_. The two sides of such\r\na bed are also distinguished by the names _torus exterior_ and _torus\r\ninterior_, or _sponda exterior_ and _sponda interior_; and from these\r\nexpressions it is not improbable that such lecti had two beds or\r\nmattresses, one for each person. Mattresses were in the earlier times\r\nfilled with dry herbs or straw, and such beds continued to be used\r\nby the poor. But in subsequent times wool, and, at a still later\r\nperiod, feathers, were used by the wealthy for the beds as well as\r\nthe pillows. The cloth or ticking (_operimentum_ or _involucrum_)\r\nwith which the beds or mattresses were covered, was called _toral_,\r\n_torale_, _linteum_, or _segestre_. The blankets or counterpanes\r\n(_vestes stragulae_, _stragula_, _peristromata_, _peripetasmata_)\r\nwere in the houses of wealthy Romans of the most costly description,\r\nand generally of a purple colour, and embroidered with beautiful\r\nfigures in gold. Covers of this sort were called _peripetasmata\r\nAttalica_, because they were said to have been first used at the\r\ncourt of Attalus. The pillows were likewise covered with magnificent\r\ncasings. The _lectus genialis_ or _adversus_ was the bridal bed,\r\nwhich stood in the atrium, opposite the janua, whence it derived\r\nthe epithet _adversus_. It was generally high, with steps by its\r\nside, and in later times beautifully adorned. Respecting the lectus\r\nfunebris see FUNUS. An account of the disposition of the couches used\r\nat entertainments is given under TRICLINIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĒGĀTĬO LĪBĔRA. [LEGATUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĒGĀTUM, a part of the hereditas which a testator gives out of it,\r\nfrom the heres (_ab herede_); that is, it is a gift to a person out\r\nof that whole (_universum_) which is diminished to the heres by\r\nsuch gift. There were several laws limiting the amount of property\r\nwhich a person might give in legacies; and it was at last fixed by\r\nthe Lex Falcidia (B.C. 40), that he should not bequeath more than\r\nthree-fourths of his property in legacies, and thus a fourth was left\r\nto the heres. By the Law of the Twelve Tables a man could dispose\r\nof his property as he pleased, and he might exhaust (_erogare_) the\r\nwhole hereditas by legacies and bequests of freedom to slaves, so as\r\nto leave the heres nothing. The consequence was that in such cases\r\nthe scripti heredes refused to take the hereditas, and there was of\r\ncourse an intestacy. Legata were inutilia or void, if they were given\r\nbefore a heres was instituted by the will, for the will derived all\r\nits legal efficacy from such institution; there was the same rule as\r\nto a gift of freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĒGĀTUS, from _lego_, a person commissioned or deputed to do certain\r\nthings. They may be divided into three classes:--1. Legati or\r\nambassadors sent to Rome by foreign nations; 2. Legati or ambassadors\r\nsent from Rome to foreign nations and into the provinces; 3. Legati\r\nwho accompanied the Roman generals into the field, or the proconsuls\r\nand praetors into the provinces. 1. Foreign legati at Rome, from\r\nwhatever country they came, had to go to the temple of Saturn, and\r\ndeposit their names with the quaestors. Previous to their admission\r\ninto the city, foreign ambassadors seem to have been obliged to give\r\nnotice from what nation they came and for what purpose; for several\r\ninstances are mentioned, in which ambassadors were prohibited from\r\nentering the city, especially in case of a war between Rome and the\r\nstate from which they came. In such cases the ambassadors were either\r\nnot heard at all, and obliged to quit Italy, or an audience was given\r\nto them by the senate (_senatus legatis datur_) outside the city,\r\nin the temple of Bellona. This was evidently a sign of mistrust,\r\nbut the ambassadors were nevertheless treated as public guests, and\r\nsome public villa outside the city was sometimes assigned for their\r\nreception. In other cases, however, as soon as the report of the\r\nlanding of foreign ambassadors on the coast of Italy was brought to\r\nRome, especially if they were persons of great distinction, or if\r\nthey came from an ally of the Roman people, some one of the inferior\r\nmagistrates, or a legatus of a consul, was despatched by the senate\r\nto receive, and conduct them to the city at the expense of the\r\nrepublic. When they were introduced into the senate by the praetor\r\nor consul, they first explained what they had to communicate, and\r\nthen the praetor invited the senators to put their questions to the\r\nambassadors. The whole transaction was carried on by interpreters,\r\nand in the Latin language. [INTERPRES.] After the ambassadors had\r\nthus been examined, they were requested to leave the assembly of the\r\nsenate, who now began to discuss the subject brought before them. The\r\nresult was communicated to the ambassadors by the praetor. In some\r\ncases ambassadors not only received rich presents on their departure,\r\nbut were at the command of the senate conducted by a magistrate, and\r\nat the public expense, to the frontier of Italy, and even farther.\r\nBy the Lex Gabinia it was decreed, that from the 1st of February\r\nto the 1st of March, the senate should every day give audience to\r\nforeign ambassadors. There was a place on the right-hand side of\r\nthe senate-house, called Graecostasis, in which foreign ambassadors\r\nwaited. All ambassadors, whencesoever they came, were considered by\r\nthe Romans throughout the whole period of their existence as sacred\r\nand inviolable. 2. Legati to foreign nations in the name of the Roman\r\nrepublic were always sent by the senate; and to be appointed to such\r\na mission was considered a great honour, which was conferred only\r\non men of high rank or eminence: for a Roman ambassador had the\r\npowers of a magistrate and the venerable character of a priest. If\r\na Roman during the performance of his mission as ambassador died or\r\nwas killed, his memory was honoured by the republic with a public\r\nsepulchre and a statue in the Rostra. The expenses during the journey\r\nof an ambassador were, of course, paid by the republic; and when he\r\ntravelled through a province, the provincials had to supply him with\r\nevery thing he wanted. 3. The third class of legati, to whom the name\r\nof ambassadors cannot be applied, were persons who accompanied the\r\nRoman generals on their expeditions, and in later times the governors\r\nof provinces also. They are mentioned at a very early period as\r\nserving along with the tribunes, under the consuls. They were\r\nnominated (_legabantur_) by the consul or the dictator under whom\r\nthey served, but the sanction of the senate was an essential point,\r\nwithout which no one could be legally considered a legatus. The\r\npersons appointed to this office were usually men of great military\r\ntalents, and it was their duty to advise and assist their superior\r\nin all his undertakings, and to act in his stead both in civil\r\nand military affairs. The legati were thus always men in whom the\r\nconsul placed great confidence, and were frequently his friends or\r\nrelations: but they had no power independent of the command of their\r\ngeneral. Their number varied according to the greatness or importance\r\nof the war, or the extent of the province: three is the smallest\r\nnumber that we know of, but Pompey, when in Asia, had fifteen legati.\r\nWhenever the consuls were absent from the army, or when a proconsul\r\nleft his province, the legati or one of them took his place, and then\r\nhad the insignia as well as the power of his superior. He was in\r\nthis case called legatus pro praetore, and hence we sometimes read\r\nthat a man governed a province as legatus without any mention being\r\nmade of the proconsul whose vicegerent he was. During the latter\r\nperiod of the republic, it sometimes happened that a consul carried\r\non a war, or a proconsul governed his province, through his legati,\r\nwhile he himself remained at Rome, or conducted some other more\r\nurgent affairs. When the provinces were divided at the time of the\r\nempire [PROVINCIA], those of the Roman people were governed by men\r\nwho had been either consuls or praetors, and the former were always\r\naccompanied by three legati, the latter by one. The provinces of the\r\nemperor, who was himself the proconsul, were governed by persons whom\r\nthe emperor himself appointed, and who had been consuls or praetors,\r\nor were at least senators. These vicegerents of the emperor were\r\ncalled _legati augusti pro praetore_, _legati praetorii_, _legati\r\nconsulares_, or simply _legati_, and they, like the governors of\r\nthe provinces of the Roman people, had one or three legati as their\r\nassistants. During the latter period of the republic it had become\r\ncustomary for senators to obtain from the senate the permission\r\nto travel through or stay in any province at the expense of the\r\nprovincials, merely for the purpose of managing and conducting their\r\nown personal affairs. There was no restraint as to the length of time\r\nthe senators were allowed to avail themselves of this privilege,\r\nwhich was a heavy burden upon the provincials. This mode of\r\nsojourning in a province was called _legatio libera_, because those\r\nwho availed themselves of it enjoyed all the privileges of a public\r\nlegatus or ambassador, without having any of his duties to perform.\r\nAt the time of Cicero the privilege of legatio libera was abused to\r\na very great extent. Cicero, therefore, in his consulship (B.C. 63)\r\nendeavoured to put an end to it, but, owing to the opposition of a\r\ntribune, he only succeeded in limiting the time of its duration to\r\none year. Julius Caesar afterwards extended the time during which a\r\nsenator might avail himself of the legatio libera to five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĔGĬO. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLEITURGIA (λειτουργία, from λεῖτον, Ion. λήϊτον, _i.e._ δημόσιον, or,\r\naccording to others, πρυτανεῖον), a liturgy, is the name of certain\r\npersonal services which, at Athens, every citizen who possessed\r\na certain amount of property had to perform towards the state.\r\nThese personal services, which in all cases were connected with\r\nconsiderable expenses, were at first a natural consequence of the\r\ngreater political privileges enjoyed by the wealthy, who, in return,\r\nhad also to perform heavier duties towards the republic; but when the\r\nAthenian democracy was at its height the original character of these\r\nliturgies became changed, for, as every citizen now enjoyed the same\r\nrights and privileges as the wealthiest, they were simply a tax upon\r\nproperty connected with personal labour and exertion. All liturgies\r\nmay be divided into two classes: 1, ordinary or encyclic liturgies\r\n(ἐγκύκλιοι λειτουργίαι); and 2, extraordinary liturgies. The former\r\nwere called encyclic, because they recurred every year at certain\r\nfestive seasons, and comprised the _Choregia_, _Gymnasiarchia_,\r\n_Lampadarchia_, _Architheoria_, and _Hestiasis_. Every Athenian who\r\npossessed three talents and above was subject to them, and they were\r\nundertaken in turns by the members of every tribe who possessed the\r\nproperty qualification just mentioned, unless some one volunteered to\r\nundertake a liturgy for another person. But the law did not allow any\r\none to be compelled to undertake more than one liturgy at a time, and\r\nhe who had in one year performed a liturgy was free for the next, so\r\nthat legally a person had to perform a liturgy only every other year.\r\nThose whose turn it was to undertake any of the ordinary liturgies\r\nwere always appointed by their own tribe. The persons who were exempt\r\nfrom all kinds of liturgies were the nine archons, heiresses, and\r\norphans until after the commencement of the second year of their\r\ncoming of age. Sometimes the exemption from liturgies (ἀτελεία) was\r\ngranted to persons for especial merits towards the republic. The only\r\nkind of extraordinary liturgy to which the name is properly applied\r\nis the _trierarchia_ (τριηραρχία); in the earlier times, however, the\r\nservice in the armies was in reality no more than an extraordinary\r\nliturgy. [See EISPHORA and TRIERARCHIA.] In later times, during and\r\nafter the Peloponnesian war, when the expenses of a liturgy were\r\nfound too heavy for one person, we find that in many instances two\r\npersons combined to defray its expenses. Such was the case with the\r\nchoragia and the trierarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMBUS, a skiff or small boat, used for carrying a person from a ship\r\nto the shore. The name was also given to the light boats which were\r\nsent ahead of a fleet to obtain information of the enemy’s movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMNISCUS (λημνίσκος), a kind of coloured ribbon which hung down\r\nfrom crowns or diadems at the back part of the head. Coronae adorned\r\nwith lemnisci were a greater distinction than those without them.\r\nThis serves to explain an expression of Cicero (_palma lemniscata,\r\npro Rosc. Am._ 35), where palma means a victory, and the epithet\r\nlemniscata indicates the contrary of infamis, and at the same time\r\nimplies an honourable as well as lucrative victory. Lemnisci were\r\nalso worn alone and without being connected with crowns, especially\r\nby ladies, as an ornament for the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĔMŬRĬA, a festival for the souls of the departed, which was\r\ncelebrated at Rome every year in the month of May. It was said to\r\nhave been instituted by Romulus to appease the spirit of Remus,\r\nwhom he had slain, and to have been called originally Remuria. It\r\nwas celebrated at night and in silence, and during three alternate\r\ndays, that is, on the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth of May. During\r\nthis season the temples of the gods were closed, and it was thought\r\nunlucky for women to marry at this time and during the whole month\r\nof May, and those who ventured to marry were believed to die soon\r\nafter, whence the proverb, _mense Maio malae nubent_. Those who\r\ncelebrated the Lemuria walked barefooted, washed their hands three\r\ntimes, and threw black beans nine times behind their backs, believing\r\nby this ceremony to secure themselves against the Lemures. As regards\r\nthe solemnities on each of the three days, we only know that on the\r\nsecond there were games in the circus in honour of Mars, and that on\r\nthe third day the images of the thirty Argei, made of rushes, were\r\nthrown from the Pons Sublicius into the Tiber by the Vestal virgins\r\n[ARGEI]. On the same day there was a festival of the merchants,\r\nprobably because on this day the temple of Mercury had been dedicated\r\nin the year 495 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĒNAEA. [DIONYSIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLESCHĒ (λέσχη), an Ionic word, signifying _council_ or\r\n_conversation_, and _a place for council or conversation_. There is\r\nfrequent mention of places of public resort, in the Greek cities, by\r\nthe name of _Leschae_, some set apart for the purpose, and others so\r\ncalled because they were so used by loungers; to the latter class\r\nbelong the agora and its porticoes, the gymnasia, and the shops\r\nof various tradesmen. The former class were small buildings or\r\nporticoes, furnished with seats, and exposed to the sun, to which\r\nthe idle resorted to enjoy conversation, and the poor to obtain\r\nwarmth and shelter: at Athens alone there were 360 such. In the\r\nDorian states the word retained the meaning of a place of meeting for\r\ndeliberation and intercourse, a council-chamber or club-room. There\r\nwere generally chambers for council and conversation, called by this\r\nname, attached to the temples of Apollo. The _Lesche_ at Delphi was\r\ncelebrated through Greece for the paintings with which it was adorned\r\nby Polygnotus.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEX. Of Roman leges, viewed with reference to the mode of enactment,\r\nthere were properly two kinds, _Leges Curiatae_ and _Leges\r\nCenturiatae_. Plebiscita are improperly called leges, though they\r\nwere laws, and in the course of time had the same effect as leges.\r\n[PLEBISCITUM.] Originally the leges curiatae were the only leges,\r\nand they were passed by the populus in the comitia curiata. After\r\nthe establishment of the comitia centuriata, the comitia curiata\r\nfell almost into disuse; but so long as the republic lasted, and\r\neven under Augustus, a shadow of the old constitution was preserved\r\nin the formal conferring of the imperium by a lex curiata only,\r\nand in the ceremony of adrogation being effected only in these\r\ncomitia. [ADOPTIO.] Those leges, properly so called, with which\r\nwe are acquainted, were passed in the comitia centuriata, and were\r\nproposed (_rogabantur_) by a magistratus of senatorial rank, after\r\nthe senate had approved of them by a decretum. Such a lex was\r\nalso designated by the name _Populi Scitum_.--The word _rogatio_\r\n(from the verb _rogo_) properly means any measure proposed to the\r\nlegislative body, and therefore is equally applicable to a proposed\r\nlex and a proposed plebiscitum. It corresponds to our word _bill_,\r\nas opposed to _act_. When the measure was passed, it became a lex\r\nor plebiscitum; though rogationes, after they had become laws, were\r\nsometimes, but improperly, called rogationes. A rogatio began with\r\nthe words _velitis_, _jubeatis_, &c., and ended with the words _ita\r\nvos Quirites rogo_. The corresponding expression of assent to the\r\nrogatio on the part of the sovereign assembly was _uti rogas_. The\r\nphrases for proposing a law are _rogare legem_, _legem ferre_, and\r\n_rogationem promulgare_; the phrase _rogationem accipere_ applies\r\nto the enacting body. The terms relating to legislation are thus\r\nexplained by Ulpian the jurist:--“A lex is said either _rogari_ or\r\n_ferri_; it is said _abrogari_, when it is repealed; it is said\r\n_derogari_, when a part is repealed; it is said _subrogari_, when\r\nsome addition is made to it; and it is said _obrogari_, when some\r\npart of it is changed.”--A _privilegium_ is an enactment that had\r\nfor its object a single person, which is indicated by the form of\r\nthe word (_privilegium_), _privae res_ being the same as _singulae\r\nres_. The word privilegium did not convey any notion of the character\r\nof the legislative measures; it might be beneficial to the party to\r\nwhom it referred, or it might not. Under the empire, the word is\r\nused in the sense of a special grant proceeding from the imperial\r\nfavour.--The title of a lex was generally derived from the gentile\r\nname of the magistratus who proposed it, as the _Lex Hortensia_ from\r\nthe dictator Hortensius. Sometimes the lex took its name from the\r\ntwo consuls or other magistrates, as the _Acilia Calpurnia_, _Aelia_\r\nor _Aelia Sentia_, _Papia_ or _Papia Poppaea_, and others. It seems\r\nto have been the fashion to omit the word _et_ between the two\r\nnames, though instances occur in which it was used. A lex was also\r\ndesignated, with reference to its object, as the _Lex Cincia de Donis\r\net Muneribus_, _Lex Furia Testamentaria_, _Lex Julia Municipalis_,\r\nand many others. Leges which related to a common object, were often\r\ndesignated by a collective name, as _Leges Agrariae_, _Judiciariae_,\r\nand others. A lex sometimes took its name from the chief contents\r\nof its first chapter, as _Lex Julia de Maritandis Ordinibus_.\r\nSometimes a lex comprised very various provisions, relating to\r\nmatters essentially different, and in that case it was called _Lex\r\nSatura_.--The number of leges was greatly increased in the later\r\npart of the republican period, and Julius Caesar is said to have\r\ncontemplated a revision of the whole body. Under him and Augustus\r\nnumerous enactments were passed, which are known under the general\r\nname of Juliae Leges. It is often stated that no leges, properly so\r\ncalled, or plebiscita, were passed after the time of Augustus; but\r\nthis is a mistake. Though the voting might be a mere form, still\r\nthe form was kept. Besides, various leges are mentioned as having\r\nbeen passed under the Empire, such as the Lex Junia under Tiberius,\r\nthe Lex Visellia, the Lex Mamilia under Caligula, and a Lex Claudia\r\non the tutela of women. It does not appear when the ancient forms\r\nof legislation were laid aside. A particular enactment is always\r\nreferred to by its name. The following is a list of the principal\r\nleges, properly so called; but the list includes also various\r\nplebiscita and privilegia:--\r\n\r\n  ACĪLĬA, De Coloniis Deducendis. (Liv. xxxii. 29.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  ACĪLIA. [REPETUNDAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ACĪLIA CALPURNĬA or CALPURNIA. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  AEBUTĬA, of uncertain date, which with two Juliae Leges put an end\r\n  to the Legis Actiones, except in certain cases. This or another\r\n  lex of the same name prohibited the proposer of a lex, which\r\n  created any office or power (_curatio ac potestas_), from having\r\n  such office or power, and even excluded his collegae, cognati, and\r\n  affines.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AELIA. This lex and a Fufia Lex, passed about the end of the sixth\r\n  century of the city, gave to all the magistrates the obnunciatio,\r\n  or power of preventing or dissolving the comitia, by observing the\r\n  omens and declaring them to be unfavourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AELĬA, De Coloniis Deducendis. (Liv. xxxiv. 53.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  AELĬA SENTĬA, passed in the time of Augustus (about A.D. 3). This\r\n  lex contained various provisions as to the manumission of slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AEMĬLĬA. A lex passed in the dictatorship of Mamercus Aemilius\r\n  (B.C. 433), by which the censors were elected for a year and\r\n  a half, instead of a whole lustrum. After this lex they had\r\n  accordingly only a year and a half allowed them for holding the\r\n  census and letting out the public works to farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AEMĬLĬA BAEBĬA. [CORNELIA BAEBIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  AEMĬLĬA. [LEGES SUMPTUARIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  AGRĀRÏAE, the name of laws which had relation to the ager\r\n  publicus. [AGER PUBLICUS.] The most important of these are\r\n  mentioned under the names of their proposers. [APPULEIA; CASSIA;\r\n  CORNELIA; FLAMINIA; FLAVIA; JULIA; LICINIA; SEMPRONIA; SERVILIA;\r\n  THORIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  AMBĬTUS. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  AMPĬA, to allow Cn. Pompeius to wear a crown of bay at the Ludi\r\n  Circenses, &c. Proposed by T. Ampius and T. Labienus, tr. pl. B.C.\r\n  64.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANNĀLIS or VILLĬA, proposed by L. Villius Tapulus in B.C. 179,\r\n  fixed the age at which a Roman citizen might become a candidate for\r\n  the higher magistracies. It appears that until this law was passed,\r\n  any office might be enjoyed by a citizen after completing his\r\n  twenty-seventh year. The Lex Annalis fixed 31 as the age for the\r\n  quaestorship, 37 for the aedileship, 40 for the praetorship, and 43\r\n  for the consulship.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANTĬA. [SUMPTUARIAE LEGES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANTŌNĬA DE THERMENSIBUS, about B.C. 72, by which Thermessus in\r\n  Pisidia was recognised as Libera.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANTŌNĬAE, the name of various enactments proposed or passed by the\r\n  influence of M. Antonius, after the death of the dictator J. Caesar.\r\n\r\n\r\n  APPŬLĒIA, respecting sureties.\r\n\r\n\r\n  APPŬLĒIA AGRĀRĬA, proposed by the tribune L. Appuleius Saturninus,\r\n  B.C. 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n  APPŬLĒIA FRŪMENTĀRĬA, proposed about the same time by the same\r\n  tribune.\r\n\r\n\r\n  APPŬLĒIA, DE COLONIIS DEDUCENDIS. (Cic. _pro Balbo_, 21.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  APPŬLĒIA MAJESTĀTIS. [MAJESTAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ATERNIA TARPĒIA, B.C. 455. This lex empowered all magistrates to\r\n  fine persons who resisted their authority; but it fixed the highest\r\n  fine at two sheep and thirty cows, or two cows and thirty sheep,\r\n  for the authorities vary in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ĂTĬA DE SĂCERDŌTIIS (B.C. 63), proposed by the tribune T. Atius\r\n  Labienus, repealed the Lex Cornelia de Sacerdotiis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ĂTĪLĬA MARCĬA, B.C. 312, empowered the populus to elect 16 tribuni\r\n  militum for each of four legions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ĂTĪLĬA, respecting tutores.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ĂTĪNĬA, respecting thefts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ĂTĪNĬA, of uncertain date, was a plebiscitum which gave the rank\r\n  of senator to a tribune. This measure probably originated with C.\r\n  Atinius, who was tribune B.C. 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AUFĬDĬA. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  AURĒLĬA (B.C. 70), enacted that the judices should be chosen from\r\n  the senators, equites, and tribuni aerarii. [JUDEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  AURĒLĬA TRĬBŪNĬCĬA, respecting the tribunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BAEBĬA (B.C. 192 or 180), enacted that four praetors and six\r\n  praetors should be chosen alternately; but the law was not observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BAEBĬA CORNĒLĬA. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAECĬLĬA DE CENSŌRĬBUS or CENSŌRIA (B.C. 54), proposed by Metellus\r\n  Scipio, repealed a Clodia Lex (B.C. 58), which had prescribed\r\n  certain regular forms of proceeding for the censors in exercising\r\n  their functions as inspectors of mores, and had required the\r\n  concurrence of both censors to inflict the nota censoria. When\r\n  a senator had been already convicted before an ordinary court,\r\n  the lex permitted the censors to remove him from the senate in a\r\n  summary way.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAECĬLĬA DE VECTĪGĀLĬBUS (B.C. 62), released lands and harbours in\r\n  Italy from the payment of taxes and dues (_portoria_). The only\r\n  vectigal remaining after the passing of this lex was the Vicesima.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAECĬLĬA DĪDĬA (B.C. 98) forbade the proposing of a Lex Satura, on\r\n  the ground that the people might be compelled either to vote for\r\n  something which they did not approve, or to reject something which\r\n  they did approve, if it was proposed to them in this manner. This\r\n  lex was not always operative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAELIA. [LEGES TABELLARIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CĂLĬGŬLAE LEX AGUĀRĬA. [MAMILIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CALPURNĬA DE AMBĬTU. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CALPURNĬA DE RĔPĔTUNDIS. [REPETUNDAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CĂNŬLĒIA. (B.C. 445) established connubium between the patres and\r\n  plebs, which had been taken away by the law of the Twelve Tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CASSĬA (B.C. 104), proposed by the tribune L. Cassius Longinus,\r\n  did not allow a person to remain a senator who had been convicted\r\n  in a judicium populi, or whose imperium had been abrogated by the\r\n  populus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CASSĬA empowered the dictator Caesar to add to the number of the\r\n  patricii, to prevent their extinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CASSĬA AGRĀRĬA, proposed by the consul Sp. Cassius, B.C. 486. This\r\n  is said to have been the first agrarian law. It enacted that of\r\n  the land taken from the Hernicans, half should be given to the\r\n  Latins, and half to the plebs, and likewise that part of the public\r\n  land possessed by the patricians should be distributed among the\r\n  plebeians. This law met with the most violent opposition, and\r\n  appears not to have been carried. Cassius was accused of aiming at\r\n  the sovereignty, and was put to death. [AGER PUBLICUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CASSĬA TĂBELLĀRĬA. [LEGES TABELLARIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CASSĬA TĔRENTĬA FRŪMENTĀRĬA (B.C. 73) for the distribution of corn\r\n  among the poor citizens and the purchasing of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CINCĬA DE DŌNIS ET MŪNĔRĬBUS, a plebiscitum passed in the time of\r\n  the tribune M. Cincius Alimentus (B.C. 204). It forbade a person\r\n  to take any thing for his pains in pleading a cause. In the time\r\n  of Augustus, the Lex Cincia was confirmed by a senatus-consultum,\r\n  and a penalty of four times the sum received was imposed on the\r\n  advocate. The law was so far modified in the time of Claudius, that\r\n  an advocate was allowed to receive ten sestertia; if he took any\r\n  sum beyond that, he was liable to be prosecuted for repetundae.\r\n  It appears that this permission was so far restricted in Trajan’s\r\n  time, that the fee could not be paid till the work was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CLAUDĬA, passed under the emperor Claudius, took away the agnatorum\r\n  tutela in case of women.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CLAUDĬA DE SENATORIBUS, B.C. 218 (Liv. xxi. 63), the provisions of\r\n  which are alluded to by Cicero as antiquated and dead in his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CLŌDIAE, the name of various plebiscita, proposed by Clodius, when\r\n  tribune, B.C. 58.\r\n\r\n    CLODIA DE AUSPICIIS prevented the magistratus from dissolving the\r\n    comitia tributa, by declaring that the auspices were unfavourable.\r\n    This lex therefore repealed the Aelia and Fufia. It also enacted\r\n    that a lex might be passed on the dies fasti. [AELIA LEX.]\r\n\r\n    CLODIA DE CENSORIBUS. [CAECILIA.]\r\n\r\n    CLODIA DE CIVIBUS ROMANIS INTEREMPTIS, to the effect that\r\n    “qui civem Romanum indemnatum interemisset, ei aqua et igni\r\n    interdiceretur.” It was in consequence of this lex that the\r\n    interdict was pronounced against Cicero, who considers the whole\r\n    proceeding as a privilegium.\r\n\r\n    CLODIA FRUMENTARIA, by which the corn, which had formerly been sold\r\n    to the poor citizens at a low rate, was given.\r\n\r\n    CLODIA DE SODALITATIBUS or DE COLLEGIIS restored the Sodalitia,\r\n    which had been abolished by a senatus-consultum of the year B.C.\r\n    80, and permitted the formation of new Sodalitia.\r\n\r\n    CLODIA DE LIBERTINORUM SUFFRAGIIS. (Cic. _pro Mil._ 12, 33.)\r\n\r\n    CLODIA DE REGE PTOLEMAEO ET DE EXSULIBUS BYZANTINIS. (Vell. Pat.\r\n    ii. 45.)\r\n\r\n    There were other so-called Leges Clodiae, which were however\r\n    privilegia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  COMMISSORĬA LEX, respecting sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CORNĒLĬAE. Various leges passed in the dictatorship of Sulla, and\r\n  by his influence, are so called.\r\n\r\n    AGRARIA, by which many of the inhabitants of Etruria and Latium\r\n    were deprived of the complete civitas, and retained only the\r\n    commercium, and a large part of their lands were made public, and\r\n    given to military colonists.\r\n\r\n    DE CIVITATE. (Liv., _Epit._ 86.)\r\n\r\n    DE FALSIS, against those who forged testaments or other deeds, and\r\n    against those who adulterated or counterfeited the public coin,\r\n    whence Cicero calls it _testamentaria_ and _nummaria_.\r\n\r\n    DE INJURIIS. [INJURIA.]\r\n\r\n    JUDICIARIA. [JUDEX.]\r\n\r\n    DE MAGISTRATIBUS, partly a renewal of old plebiscita. (Appian, B.C.\r\n    i. 100, 101.)\r\n\r\n    MAJESTATIS. [MAJESTAS.]\r\n\r\n    DE PARRICIDIO. [See below: DE SICARIIS.]\r\n\r\n    DE PROSCRIPTIONE ET PROSCRIPTIS. [PROSCRIPTIO.]\r\n\r\n    DE PROVINCIIS ORDINANDIS. (Cic. _ad Fam._ i. 9; iii. 6, 8, 10.)\r\n\r\n    DE REPETUNDIS. [REPETUNDAE.]\r\n\r\n    DE SACERDOTIIS. [SACERDOS.]\r\n\r\n    DE SICARIIS ET VENEFICIS, contained provisions as to death or fire\r\n    caused by _dolus malus_, and against persons going about armed with\r\n    the intention of killing or thieving. The law not only provided\r\n    for cases of poisoning, but contained provisions against those who\r\n    made, sold, bought, possessed, or gave poison for the purpose of\r\n    poisoning; also against a magistratus or senator who conspired in\r\n    order that a person might be condemned in a _judicium publicum_, &c.\r\n\r\n    SUMPTUARIAE. [LEGES SUMPTUARIAE.]\r\n\r\n    TRIBUNICIA, which diminished the power of the Tribuni Plebis.\r\n\r\n    UNCIARIA appears to have been a lex which lowered the rate of\r\n    interest, and to have been passed about the same time with the\r\n    Leges Sumptuariae of Sulla.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CORNĒLĬAE, which were proposed by the tribune C. Cornelius about\r\n  B.C. 67. One limited the edictal power by compelling the praetors\r\n  _Jus dicere ex edictis suis perpetuis_.--Another lex of the same\r\n  tribune enacted that no one _legibus solveretur_, unless such a\r\n  measure was agreed on in a meeting of the senate at which two\r\n  hundred members were present, and afterwards approved by the\r\n  people; and it enacted that no tribune should put his veto on such\r\n  a senatus-consultum.--There was also a Lex Cornelia concerning the\r\n  wills of those Roman citizens who died in captivity (_apud hostes_).\r\n\r\n\r\n  CORNĒLIA DE NOVIS TABELLIS, proposed by P. Corn. Dolabella, B.C. 47.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CORNĒLIA ET CAECĬLĪA, B.C. 57, gave Cn. Pompeius the\r\n  superintendence of the Res Frumentaria for five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CORNĒLĬA BAEBĬA DE AMBĬTU, proposed by the consuls P. Cornelius\r\n  Cethegus and M. Baebius Tamphilus, B.C. 181. This law is sometimes,\r\n  but erroneously, attributed to the consuls of the preceding year,\r\n  L. Aemilius and Cn. Baebius. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CŪRIĀTA LEX DE IMPERIO.

[LEGES SUMPTUARIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  DOMĬTĬA DE SĂCERDŌTIIS. [SACERDOS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  DUĪLĬA (B.C. 449), a plebiscitum proposed by the tribune Duilius,\r\n  which enacted that whoever left the people without tribunes, or\r\n  created a magistrate from whom there was no appeal (_provocatio_),\r\n  should be scourged and beheaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DUĪLĬA MAENĬA, proposed by the tribunes Duilius and Maenius\r\n  (B.C. 357), restored the old uncial rate of interest (_unciarium\r\n  fenus_), which had been fixed by the Twelve Tables. [FENUS.] The\r\n  same tribunes carried a measure which was intended, in future, to\r\n  prevent such unconstitutional proceedings as the enactment of a lex\r\n  by the soldiers out of Rome, on the proposal of the consul.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DŬŎDĔCIM TĂBŬLĀRUM. In the year B.C. 454 the Senate assented to a\r\n  Plebiscitum, pursuant to which commissioners were to be sent to\r\n  Athens and the Greek cities generally, in order to make themselves\r\n  acquainted with their laws. Three commissioners were appointed\r\n  for the purpose. On the return of the commissioners, B.C. 452,\r\n  it was agreed that persons should be appointed to draw up the\r\n  code of laws (decemviri Legibus scribundis), but they were to be\r\n  chosen only from the Patricians, with a provision that the rights\r\n  of the Plebeians should be respected by the decemviri in drawing\r\n  up the laws. In the following year (B.C. 451) the Decemviri were\r\n  appointed in the Comitia Centuriata, and during the time of their\r\n  office no other magistratus were chosen. The body consisted of\r\n  ten Patricians, including the three commissioners who had been\r\n  sent abroad: Appius Claudius, Consul designatus, was at the head\r\n  of the body. Ten Tables of Laws were prepared during the year,\r\n  and after being approved by the Senate were confirmed by the\r\n  Comitia Centuriata. As it was considered that some further Laws\r\n  were wanted, Decemviri were again elected B.C. 450, consisting of\r\n  Appius Claudius and his friends. Two more Tables were added by\r\n  these Decemviri, which Cicero calls “Duae tabulae iniquarum legum.”\r\n  The provision which allowed no connubium between the Patres and\r\n  the Plebs is referred to the Eleventh Table. The whole Twelve\r\n  Tables were first published in the consulship of L. Valerius and\r\n  M. Horatius after the downfall of the Decemviri, B.C. 449. This\r\n  the first attempt to make a code remained also the only attempt\r\n  for near one thousand years, until the legislation of Justinian.\r\n  The Twelve Tables are mentioned by the Roman writers under a great\r\n  variety of names: _Leges Decemvirales_, _Lex Decemviralis_, _Leges\r\n  XII._, _Lex XII. tabularum_ or _Duodecim_, and sometimes they are\r\n  referred to under the names of _Leges_ and _Lex_ simply, as being\r\n  pre-eminently The Law. The Laws were cut on bronze tablets and\r\n  put up in a public place. They contained matters relating both to\r\n  the Jus Publicum and the Jus Privatum (_fons publici privatique\r\n  juris_). The Jus Publicum underwent great changes in the course of\r\n  years, but the Jus Privatum of the Twelve Tables continued to be\r\n  the fundamental law of the Roman State. The Roman writers speak\r\n  in high terms of the precision of the enactments contained in the\r\n  Twelve Tables, and of the propriety of the language in which they\r\n  were expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FĂBĬA DE PLĂGIO.

[JUNIA DE PEREGRINIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FLĀMĬNĬA was an Agraria Lex for the distribution of lands in\r\n  Picenum, proposed by the tribune C. Flaminius, in B.C. 228\r\n  according to Cicero, or in B.C. 232 according to Polybius. The\r\n  latter date is the more probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FLĀVĬA AGRĀRĬA, B.C. 60, for the distribution of lands among\r\n  Pompey’s soldiers, proposed by the tribune L. Flavius, who\r\n  committed the consul Caecilius Metellus to prison for opposing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FRŪMENTĀRĬAE. Various leges were so called which had for their\r\n  object the distribution of grain among the people, either at a low\r\n  price or gratuitously. [FRUMENTARIAE LEGES, p. 182.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FŪFĬA DE RĒLĬGĬŌNE, B.C. 61, was a privilegium which related to the\r\n  trial of Clodius.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FŪFĬA JŪDĬCĬĀRĬA. [JUDEX, p. 217.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FŪRIA or FŪSĬA CĂNĪNĬA limited the number of slaves to be\r\n  manumitted by testament.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FŪRIA or FŪSĬA TESTĂMENTĀRĬA, enacted that a testator should not\r\n  give more than three-fourths of his property in legacies, thus\r\n  securing one-fourth to the heres.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GĂBĪNĬA TĂBELLĀRĬA. [LEGES TABELLARIAE.] There were various\r\n  Gabiniae Leges, some of which were privilegia, as that for\r\n  conferring extraordinary power on Cn. Pompeius for conducting the\r\n  war against the pirates. A Gabinia Lex, B.C. 58, forbade all loans\r\n  of money at Rome to legationes from foreign parts. The object of\r\n  the lex was to prevent money being borrowed for the purpose of\r\n  bribing the senators at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GALLĬAE CISALPĪNAE. [RUBRIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  GELLIA CORNĒLĬA, B.C. 72, which gave to Cn. Pompeius the\r\n  extraordinary power of conferring the Roman civitas on Spaniards in\r\n  Spain, with the advice of his consilium.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENUCĬA, B.C. 341, forbade altogether the taking of interest for\r\n  the use of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HĬĔRŎNĬCA was not a lex properly so called. Before the Roman\r\n  conquest of Sicily, the payment of the tenths of wine, oil, and\r\n  other produce had been fixed by Hiero; and the Roman quaestors,\r\n  in letting these tenths to farm, followed the practice which they\r\n  found established.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HŎRĀTĬAE ET VALĔRĬAE. [LEGES VALERIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  HORTENSIA DE PLĒBISCĪTIS. [LEGES PUBLILIAE; PLEBISCITUM.] Another\r\n  Lex Hortensia enacted that the nundinae, which had hitherto been\r\n  feriae, should be dies fasti. This was done for the purpose of\r\n  accommodating the inhabitants of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ICILĬA, B.C. 456, by which the Aventinus was assigned to the plebs.\r\n  This was the first instance of the ager publicus being assigned to\r\n  the plebs. Another Lex Icilia, proposed by the tribune Sp. Icilius,\r\n  B.C. 470, had for its object to prevent all interruption to the\r\n  tribunes while acting in the discharge of their duties. In some\r\n  cases the penalty was death.\r\n\r\n\r\n  JŪLĬAE. Most of the Juliae Leges were passed in the time of C.\r\n  Julius Caesar and Augustus.\r\n\r\n    DE ADULTERIIS. [ADULTERIUM.]\r\n\r\n    AGRARIA, B.C. 59, in the consulship of Caesar, for distributing the\r\n    ager publicus in Campania among 20,000 poor citizens, who had each\r\n    three children or more.\r\n\r\n    DE AMBITU. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n    DE BONIS CEDENDIS. This lex provided that a debtor might escape all\r\n    personal molestation from his creditors by giving up his property\r\n    to them for the purpose of sale and distribution. It is doubtful if\r\n    this lex was passed in the time of Julius Caesar or of Augustus,\r\n    though probably of the former.\r\n\r\n    DE CAEDE ET VENEFICIO (Suet. _Ver._ 33), perhaps the same as the\r\n    Lex De Vi Publica.\r\n\r\n    DE CIVITATE was passed in the consulship of L. Julius Caesar and P.\r\n    Rutilius Lupus, B.C. 90. [CIVITAS; FOEDERATAE CIVITATES.]\r\n\r\n    DE FENORE, or rather De Pecuniis Mutuis or Creditis (B.C. 47),\r\n    passed in the time of Julius Caesar. The object of it was to make\r\n    an arrangement between debtors and creditors, for the satisfaction\r\n    of the latter. The possessiones and res were to be estimated at the\r\n    value which they had before the civil war, and to be surrendered to\r\n    the creditors at that value; whatever had been paid for interest\r\n    was to be deducted from the principal. The result was, that the\r\n    creditor lost about one-fourth of his debt; but he escaped the loss\r\n    usually consequent on civil disturbance, which would have been\r\n    caused by novae tabulae.\r\n\r\n    JUDICIARIAE.

[See below: JULIA ET PAPIA POPPAEA.]\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALIS, commonly called the Table of Heraclea. In the year\r\n    1732 there were found near the Gulf of Tarentum and in the\r\n    neighbourhood of the city of ancient Heraclea, large fragments of a\r\n    bronze table, which contained on one side a Roman lex, and on the\r\n    other a Greek inscription. The whole is now in the Museo Borbonico\r\n    at Naples. The lex contains various provisions as to the police\r\n    of the city of Rome, and as to the constitution of communities of\r\n    Roman citizens (_municipia_, _coloniae_, _praefecturae_, _fora_,\r\n    _conciliabula civium Romanorum_). It was accordingly a lex of that\r\n    kind which is called Satura. It was probably passed in B.C. 45.\r\n\r\n    JULIA ET PAPIA POPPAEA. Augustus appears to have caused a lex to\r\n    be enacted about B.C. 18, which is cited as the _Lex Julia de\r\n    Maritandis Ordinibus_, and is referred to in the Carmen Seculare of\r\n    Horace, which was written in the year B.C. 17. The object of this\r\n    lex was to regulate marriages, as to which it contained numerous\r\n    provisions; but it appears not to have come into operation till\r\n    the year B.C. 13. In the year A.D. 9, and in the consulship of\r\n    M. Papius Mutilus and Q. Poppaeus Secundus (consules suffecti),\r\n    another lex was passed as a kind of amendment and supplement to\r\n    the former lex, and hence arose the title of Lex Julia et Papia\r\n    Poppaea, by which this lex is often quoted. The lex is often\r\n    variously quoted, according as reference is made to its various\r\n    provisions; sometimes it is called _Lex Julia_, sometimes _Papia\r\n    Poppaea_, sometimes _Lex Julia et Papia_, sometimes _Lex de\r\n    Maritandis Ordinibus_, from the chapter which treated of the\r\n    marriages of the senators, sometimes _Lex Caducaria, Decimaria_,\r\n    &c. from the various chapters. The Lex Julia forbade the marriage\r\n    of a senator or senator’s children with a libertina, with a woman\r\n    whose father or mother had followed an ars ludicra, and with a\r\n    prostitute; and also the marriage of a libertinus with a senator’s\r\n    daughter. In order to promote marriage, various penalties were\r\n    imposed on those who lived in a state of celibacy (_caelibatus_)\r\n    after a certain age, and various privileges were given to those who\r\n    had three or more children. A candidate for the public offices who\r\n    had several children was preferred to one who had fewer. After the\r\n    passing of this lex, it became usual for the senate, and afterwards\r\n    the emperor (_princeps_), to give occasionally, as a privilege to\r\n    certain persons who had not children, the same advantage that the\r\n    lex secured to those who had children. This was called the _Jus\r\n    Liberorum_, and sometimes the _Jus trium Liberorum_.\r\n\r\n    PECULATUS, cited in the Digest, related to sacrilege as well as\r\n    peculatus.\r\n\r\n    JULIA ET PLAUTIA, respecting stolen things.\r\n\r\n    JULIA PAPIRIA.

Fannius,\r\n  consul B.C. 122, contained the same provisions respecting the\r\n  Latini and Italici; and a lex of C. Papius, perhaps B.C. 65,\r\n  contained the same respecting all persons who were not domiciled in\r\n  Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  JŪNĬA LĬCĬNĬA. [LICINIA JUNIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  JŪNIA NORBĀNA, of uncertain date, but probably about A.D. 17,\r\n  enacted that when a Roman citizen had manumitted a slave without\r\n  the requisite formalities, the manumission should not in all cases\r\n  be ineffectual, but the manumitted person should have the status of\r\n  a Latinus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  JŪNIA RĒPĔTUNDĀRUM.

(Liv. xxvii. 23.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  LĬCĬNIA JŪNIA, or, as it is sometimes called, Junia et Licinia,\r\n  passed in the consulship of L. Licinius Murena and Junius Silanus,\r\n  B.C. 62, enforced the Caecilia Didia, in connection with which it\r\n  is sometimes mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LĬCĬNIA MŪCĬA DE CĪVĬBUS RĔGUNDIS, passed in the consulship of L.\r\n  Licinius Crassus and Q. Mucius Scaevola, B.C. 95, enacted a strict\r\n  examination as to the title to citizenship, and deprived of the\r\n  exercise of civic rights all those who could not make out a good\r\n  title to them. This measure partly led to the Marsic war.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LĬCĬNIA SUMPTUĀRIA. [LEGES SUMPTUARIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  LĬCĬNIAE, proposed by C. Licinius, who was tribune of the people\r\n  from B.C. 376 to 367, and who brought the contest between the\r\n  patricians and plebeians to a happy termination. He was supported\r\n  in his exertions by his colleague L. Sextius. The laws which he\r\n  proposed were: 1. That in future no more consular tribunes should\r\n  be appointed, but that consuls should be elected as in former\r\n  times, one of whom should always be a plebeian. 2. That no one\r\n  should possess more than 500 jugera of the public land, nor keep\r\n  upon it more than 100 head of large, or 500 of small cattle. It\r\n  is related that Licinius was accused and condemned for violating\r\n  his own law. Livy states that Licinius, together with his son,\r\n  held 1000 jugera of the public land, and by emancipating his son\r\n  had acted in fraud of the law. The son thus possessed 500 jugera\r\n  in his own name, while his father had the actual enjoyment. 3.\r\n  A law regulating the affairs between debtor and creditor, which\r\n  ordained that the interest already paid for borrowed money should\r\n  be deducted from the capital, and that the remainder of the\r\n  latter should be paid back in three yearly instalments. 4. That\r\n  the Sibylline books should be entrusted to a college of ten men\r\n  (_decemviri_), half of whom should be plebeians, in order that no\r\n  falsifications might be introduced in favour of the patricians.\r\n  These rogations were passed after a most vehement opposition on the\r\n  part of the patricians, and L. Sextius was the first plebeian who,\r\n  in accordance with the first of them, obtained the consulship for\r\n  the year B.C. 366.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LĬCĬNIA, also called MANLĬA, B.C. 196, created the triumviri\r\n  epulones.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LĪVĬAE, various enactments proposed by the tribune M. Livius\r\n  Drusus, B.C. 91, for establishing colonies in Italy and Sicily,\r\n  distributing corn among the poor citizens at a low rate, and\r\n  admitting the foederatae civitates to the Roman civitas. He is also\r\n  said to have been the mover of a law for adulterating silver by\r\n  mixing with it an eighth part of brass. Drusus was assassinated,\r\n  and the senate declared that all his laws were passed _contra\r\n  auspicia_, and were therefore not leges.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LUTĀTIA DE VI, proposed by the consul Q. Lutatius Catulus, with the\r\n  assistance of Plautius the tribune: usually called Lex Plautia or\r\n  Plotia. [VIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  MAENĬA LEX, is only mentioned by Cicero, who says that M. Curius\r\n  compelled the patres _ante auctores fieri_ in the case of the\r\n  election of a plebeian consul, “which,” adds Cicero, “was a great\r\n  thing to accomplish, as the Lex Maenia was not yet passed.” The lex\r\n  therefore required the patres to give their consent at least to the\r\n  election of a magistratus, or, in other words, to confer or agree\r\n  to confer the imperium on the person whom the comitia should elect.\r\n  It was probably proposed by the tribune Maenius B.C. 287.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MAJESTĀTIS.

[LICINIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  MANLIA DE VĪCĒSĬMA, B.C. 357, imposed the tax of five per cent.\r\n  (_vicesima_) on the value of manumitted slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MARCĬA, probably about the year B.C. 352, _adversus feneratores_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MARCĬA, an agrarian law proposed by the tribune L.

It is mentioned by Cicero as a\r\n  more reasonable measure than the Sempronia, which was too profuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  OGULNĬA, proposed by the tribunes, B.C. 300, increased the number\r\n  of pontifices to eight, and that of the augurs to nine; it also\r\n  enacted that four of the pontifices and five of the augurs should\r\n  be taken from the plebes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  OPPĬA. [LEGES SUMPTUARIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ORCHĬA. [LEGES SUMPTUARIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ŎVĪNĬA, of uncertain date, was a plebiscitum which gave the censors\r\n  certain powers in regulating the lists of the senators (_ordo\r\n  senatorius_): the main object seems to have been to exclude all\r\n  improper persons from the senate, and to prevent their admission,\r\n  if in other respects qualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PĀPĬA DE PĔRĔGRĪNIS.

It was properly a\r\n  privilegium, but is useful as illustrating the history of the\r\n  extension of the civitas Romana.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PĂPĪRĬA, of uncertain date, enacted that no _aedes_ should be\r\n  declared _consecratae_ without a plebiscitum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PĂPĪRIA PLAUTĬA, a plebiscitum of the year B.C. 89, proposed by\r\n  the tribunes C.

(Suet.

There were various leges so called.\r\n\r\n    DE CIVITATE, proposed by Cn. Pompeius Strabo, the father of Cn.\r\n    Pompeius Magnus, probably in his consulship B.C. 89, gave the\r\n    jus Latii or Latinitas to all the towns of the Transpadani, and\r\n    probably the civitas to the Cispadani.\r\n\r\n    DE AMBITU. [AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n    DE IMPERIO CAESARI PROROGANDO. (Vell. Pat. ii. 46; Appian, B.C. ii.\r\n    18.)\r\n\r\n    JUDICIARIA. [JUDEX, p. 217, _a_.]\r\n\r\n    DE JURE MAGISTRATUUM, forbade a person to be a candidate for public\r\n    offices (_petitio honorum_) who was not at Rome; but J. Caesar was\r\n    excepted. This was doubtless the old law, but it had apparently\r\n    become obsolete.\r\n\r\n    DE PARRICIDIIS. [PARRICIDIUM.]\r\n\r\n    TRIBUNITIA (B.C. 70), restored the old tribunitia potestas, which\r\n    Sulla had nearly destroyed. [TRIBUNI.]\r\n\r\n    DE VI, was a privilegium, and only referred to the case of Milo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PORCĬAE DE CĂPĬTE CĪVĬUM, or DE PRŌVŎCĀTIŌNE, enacted that no Roman\r\n  citizen should be scourged or put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PORCIA DE PRŌVINCIIS, about B.C. 198, the enactments of which are\r\n  doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PUBLĬCĬA, permitted betting at certain games which required\r\n  strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PUBLĪLĬA. In the consulship of L. Pinarius and P. Furius, B.C.\r\n  471, the tribune Publilius Volero proposed, in the assembly of the\r\n  tribes, that the tribunes should in future be appointed in the\r\n  comitia of the tribes (_ut plebeii magistratus tributis comitiis\r\n  fierent_), instead of by the centuries, as had formerly been the\r\n  case; since the clients of the patricians were so numerous in the\r\n  centuries, that the plebeians could not elect whom they wished.\r\n  This measure was violently opposed by the patricians, who prevented\r\n  the tribes from coming to any resolution respecting it throughout\r\n  this year; but in the following year, B.C. 471, Publilius was\r\n  re-elected tribune, and together with him C. Laetorius, a man\r\n  of still greater resolution than Publilius. Fresh measures were\r\n  added to the former proposition: the aediles were to be chosen by\r\n  the tribes, as well as the tribunes, and the tribes were to be\r\n  competent to deliberate and determine on all matters affecting the\r\n  whole nation, and not such only as might concern the plebes. This\r\n  proposition, though still more violently resisted by the patricians\r\n  than the one of the previous year, was carried. Some said that the\r\n  number of the tribunes was now for the first time raised to five,\r\n  having been only two previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PUBLĪLĬAE, proposed by the dictator Q. Publilius Philo, B.C. 339.\r\n  According to Livy, there were three Publiliae Leges. 1. The first\r\n  is said to have enacted, that plebiscita should bind all Quirites,\r\n  which is to the same purport as the Lex Hortensia of B.C. 286. It\r\n  is probable, however, that the object of this law was to render the\r\n  approval of the senate a sufficient confirmation of a plebiscitum,\r\n  and to make the confirmation of the curiae unnecessary. 2. The\r\n  second law enacted, _ut legum quae comitiis centuriatis ferrerentur\r\n  ante initum suffragium patres auctores fierent_. By patres\r\n  Livy here means the curiae; and accordingly this law made the\r\n  confirmation of the curiae a mere formality in reference to all\r\n  laws submitted to the comitia centuriata, since every law proposed\r\n  by the senate to the centuries was to be considered to have the\r\n  sanction of the curiae also. 3. The third law enacted that one of\r\n  the two censors should necessarily be a plebeian. It is probable\r\n  that there was also a fourth law, which applied the Licinian law to\r\n  the praetorship as well as to the censorship, and which provided\r\n  that in each alternate year the praetor should be a plebeian.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PŪPĬA, mentioned by Cicero, seems to have enacted that the senate\r\n  could not meet on comitiales dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  QUINTĬA, was a lex proposed by T. Quintius Crispinus, consul B.C.\r\n  9, for the preservation of the aquaeductus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RĒGĬA. A _Lex Regia_ during the kingly period of Roman history\r\n  might have a two-fold meaning. In the first place it was a law\r\n  which had been passed by the comitia under the presidency of the\r\n  king, and was thus distinguished from a _Lex Tribunicia_, which was\r\n  passed by the comitia under the presidency of the tribunus celerum.\r\n  In later times all laws, the origin of which was attributed to\r\n  the time of the kings, were called _Leges Regiae_, though it by no\r\n  means follows that they were all passed under the presidency of the\r\n  kings, and much less, that they were enacted by the kings without\r\n  the sanction of the curies. Some of these laws were preserved and\r\n  followed at a very late period of Roman history. A collection\r\n  of them was made, though at what time is uncertain, by Papisius\r\n  or Papirius, and this compilation was called the _Jus Civile\r\n  Papirianum_ or _Papisianum_. The second meaning of _Lex Regia_\r\n  during the kingly period was undoubtedly the same as that of the\r\n  _Lex Curiata de Imperio_. [IMPERIUM.] This indeed is not mentioned\r\n  by any ancient writer, but must be inferred from the _Lex Regia_\r\n  which we meet with under the empire, for the name could scarcely\r\n  have been invented then; it must have come down from early times,\r\n  when its meaning was similar, though not nearly so extensive.\r\n  During the empire the curies continued to hold their meetings,\r\n  though they were only a shadow of those of former times; and after\r\n  the election of a new emperor, they conferred upon him the imperium\r\n  in the ancient form by a _Lex Curiata de Imperio_, which was now\r\n  usually called _Lex Regia_. The imperium, however, which this\r\n  _Regia Lex_ conferred upon an emperor, was of a very different\r\n  nature from that which in former times it had conferred upon the\r\n  kings. It now embraced all the rights and powers which the populus\r\n  Romanus had formerly possessed, so that the emperor became what\r\n  formerly the populus had been, that is, the sovereign power in the\r\n  state. A fragment of such a lex regia, conferring the imperium upon\r\n  Vespasian, engraved upon a brazen table, is still extant in the\r\n  Lateran at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMNĬA. [CALUMNIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  RĔPĔTUNDĀRUM. [REPETUNDAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  RHŎDĬA. The Rhodians had a maritime code which was highly esteemed.\r\n  Some of its provisions were adopted by the Romans, and have thus\r\n  been incorporated into the maritime law of European states. It was\r\n  not, however, a lex in the proper sense of the term.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ROSCĬA THEĀTRĀLIS, proposed by the tribune L. Roscius Otho, B.C.\r\n  67, which gave the equites a special place at the public spectacles\r\n  in fourteen rows or seats (_in quatuordecim gradibus sive\r\n  ordinibus_) next to the place of the senators, which was in the\r\n  orchestra. This lex also assigned a certain place to spendthrifts.\r\n  The phrase _sedere in quatuordecim ordinibus_ is equivalent to\r\n  having the proper census equestris which was required by the lex.\r\n  There are numerous allusions to this lex, which is sometimes\r\n  simply called the Lex of Otho, or referred to by his name. It is\r\n  erroneously supposed by some writers to have been enacted in the\r\n  consulship of Cicero, B.C. 63.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RUBRĬA. The province of Gallia Cisalpina ceased to be a\r\n  provincia, and became a part of Italia, about the year B.C. 43.\r\n  When this change took place, it was necessary to provide for\r\n  the administration of justice, as the usual modes of provincial\r\n  administration would cease with the determination of the provincial\r\n  form of government. This was effected by a lex, a large part of\r\n  which, on a bronze tablet, is preserved in the Museum at Parma. The\r\n  name of this lex is not known, but it is supposed by some to be the\r\n  Lex Rubria.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RŬPĬLĬAE LĒGES (B.C. 131), were the regulations established by P.\r\n  Rupilius, and ten legati, for the administration of the province of\r\n  Sicily, after the close of the first servile war. They were made\r\n  in pursuance of a consultum of the senate. Cicero speaks of these\r\n  regulations as a decretum of Rupilius, which he says they call\r\n  Lex Rupilia; but it was not a lex proper. The powers given to the\r\n  commissioners by the Lex Julia Municipalis were of a similar kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SĂCRĀTAE. Leges were properly so called which had for their object\r\n  to make a thing or person _sacer_. A lex sacrata militaris is also\r\n  mentioned by Livy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SAENĬA DE PATRICIORUM NUMERO AUGENDO, enacted in the 5th consulship\r\n  of Augustus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SĂTŬRA. [LEX, p. 226, _a_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SCANTĪNĬA, proposed by a tribune; the date and contents are not\r\n  known, but its object was to suppress unnatural crimes. It existed\r\n  in the time of Cicero.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SCRĪBŌNĬA. The date and whole import of this lex are not known; but\r\n  it enacted that a right to servitutes should not be acquired by\r\n  usucapion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SCRĪBŌNIA VĬĀRIA or DE VIIS MUNIENDIS, B.C. 51.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SEMPRŌNĬAE, the name of various laws proposed by Tiberius and Caius\r\n  Sempronius Gracchus.\r\n\r\n    AGRARIA. In B.C. 133 the tribune Tib. Gracchus revived the Agrarian\r\n    law of Licinius [LEGES LICINIAE]: he proposed that no one should\r\n    possess more than 500 jugera of the public land, and that the\r\n    surplus land should be divided among the poor citizens, who were\r\n    not to have the power of alienating it: he also proposed, as a\r\n    compensation to the possessors deprived of the land on which they\r\n    had frequently made improvements, that the former possessors should\r\n    have the full ownership of 500 jugera, and each of their sons, if\r\n    they had any, half that quantity: finally, that three commissioners\r\n    (_triumviri_) should be appointed every year to carry the law into\r\n    effect. This law naturally met with the greatest opposition, but\r\n    it was eventually passed in the year in which it was proposed, and\r\n    Tib. Gracchus, C. Gracchus, and Appius Claudius were the three\r\n    commissioners appointed under it. It was, however, never carried\r\n    fully into effect, in consequence of the murder of Tib. Gracchus.\r\n    Owing to the difficulties which were experienced in carrying his\r\n    brother’s agrarian law into effect, it was again brought forward by\r\n    C. Gracchus, B.C. 123.\r\n\r\n    DE CAPITE CIVIUM ROMANORUM, proposed by C. Gracchus B.C. 123,\r\n    enacted that the people only should decide respecting the caput or\r\n    civil condition of a citizen. This law continued in force till the\r\n    latest times of the republic.\r\n\r\n    FRUMENTARIA, proposed by C. Gracchus B.C. 123, enacted that corn\r\n    should be sold by the state to the people once a month at the price\r\n    of 6⅓ asses for each modius, which was equal to 1 gallon and nearly\r\n    8 pints English. This was only a trifle more than half the market\r\n    price.\r\n\r\n    JUDICIARIA. [JUDEX, p. 216.]\r\n\r\n    MILITARIS, proposed by C. Gracchus B.C. 123, enacted that the\r\n    soldiers should receive their clothing gratis, and that no one\r\n    should be enrolled as a soldier under the age of seventeen.\r\n    Previously a fixed sum was deducted from the pay for all clothes\r\n    and arms issued to the soldiers.\r\n\r\n    NE QUIS JUDICIO CIRCUMVENIRETUR, proposed by C. Gracchus, B.C. 123,\r\n    punished all who conspired to obtain the condemnation of a person\r\n    in a judicium publicum. One of the provisions of the Lex Cornelia\r\n    de Sicariis was to the same effect.\r\n\r\n    DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS, proposed by C. Gracchus B.C. 123,\r\n    enacted that the senate should fix each year, before the comitia\r\n    for electing the consuls were held, the two provinces which were to\r\n    be allotted to the two new consuls. There was also a Sempronian law\r\n    concerning the province of Asia, which probably did not form part\r\n    of the Lex de Provinciis Consularibus: it enacted that the taxes\r\n    of this province should be let out to farm by the censors at Rome.\r\n    This law was afterwards repealed by J. Caesar.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SEMPRŌNIA DE FĒNŎRE, B.C. 193, was a plebiscitum proposed by a\r\n  tribune, M. Sempronius, which enacted that the law (_jus_) about\r\n  money lent (_pecunia credita_) should be the same for the Socii and\r\n  Latini (_Socii ac nomen Latinum_) as for Roman citizens. The object\r\n  of the lex was to prevent Romans from lending money in the name of\r\n  the Socii, who were not bound by the fenebres leges. The lex could\r\n  obviously only apply within the jurisdiction of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SERVĪLĬA AGRĀRIA, proposed by the tribune P. S. Rullus in the\r\n  consulship of Cicero, B.C. 63, was a very extensive agrarian\r\n  rogatio. It was successfully opposed by Cicero; but it was in\r\n  substance carried by J. Caesar, B.C. 59 [LEX JULIA AGRARIA], and is\r\n  the lex called by Cicero _Lex Campana_, from the public land called\r\n  ager campanus being assigned under this lex.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SERVĪLĬA GLAUCIA DE CĪVĬTĀTE. [REPETUNDAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SERVĪLIA GLAUCIA DE RĔPĔTUNDIS. [REPETUNDAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SERVĪLIA JŪDĬCĬĀRIA, B.C. 106. [JUDEX, p. 216.] It is assumed by\r\n  some writers that a lex of the tribune Servius Glaucia repealed the\r\n  Servilia Judiciaria two years after its enactment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SĪLĬA, relating to Publica Pondera.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SILVĀNI ET CARBŌNIS. [LEX PAPIRIA PLAUTIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SULPĬCĬAE, proposed by the tribune P. Sulpicius Rufus, a\r\n  supporter of Marius, B.C. 88, enacted the recall of the exiles,\r\n  the distribution of the new citizens and the libertini among the\r\n  thirty-five tribes, that the command in the Mithridatic war should\r\n  be taken from Sulla and given to Marius, and that a senator should\r\n  not contract debt to the amount of more than 2000 denarii. The last\r\n  enactment may have been intended to expel persons from the senate\r\n  who should get in debt. All these leges were repealed by Sulla.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SULPĬCĬA SEMPRŌNĬA, B.C. 304. No name is given to this lex by Livy,\r\n  but it was probably proposed by the consuls. It prevented the\r\n  dedicatio of a templum or altar without the consent of the senate\r\n  or a majority of the tribunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUMPTUĀRĬAE, the name of various laws passed to prevent inordinate\r\n  expense (_sumptus_) in banquets, dress, &c. In the states of\r\n  antiquity it was considered the duty of government to put a check\r\n  upon extravagance in the private expenses of persons, and among the\r\n  Romans in particular we find traces of this in the laws attributed\r\n  to the kings, and in the Twelve Tables. The censors, to whom\r\n  was entrusted the _disciplina_ or _cura morum_, punished by the\r\n  _nota censoria_ all persons guilty of what was then regarded as\r\n  a luxurious mode of living; a great many instances of this kind\r\n  are recorded. But as the love of luxury greatly increased with\r\n  the foreign conquests of the republic and the growing wealth of\r\n  the nation, various leges sumptuariae were passed at different\r\n  times with the object of restraining it. These, however, as may be\r\n  supposed, rarely accomplished their object, and in the latter times\r\n  of the republic they were virtually repealed. The following list of\r\n  them is arranged in chronological order:--\r\n\r\n    OPPIA, proposed by the tribune C. Oppius in B.C. 215, enacted\r\n    that no woman should have above half an ounce of gold, nor wear a\r\n    dress of different colours, nor ride in a carriage in the city or\r\n    in any town, or within a mile of it, unless on account of public\r\n    sacrifices. This law was repealed twenty years afterwards, whence\r\n    we frequently find the Lex Orchia mentioned as the first lex\r\n    sumptuaria.\r\n\r\n    ORCHIA, proposed by the tribune C. Orchius in B.C. 181, limited the\r\n    number of guests to be present at entertainments.\r\n\r\n    FANNIA, proposed by the consul C. Fannius, B.C. 61, limited the\r\n    sums which were to be spent on entertainments, and enacted that not\r\n    more than 100 asses should be spent on certain festivals named in\r\n    the lex, whence it is called _centussis_ by Lucilius; that on ten\r\n    other days in each month not more than 30 asses, and that on all\r\n    other days not more than 10 asses, should be expended; also that no\r\n    other fowl but one hen should be served up, and that not fattened\r\n    for the purpose.\r\n\r\n    DIDIA, passed B.C. 143, extended the Lex Fannia to the whole of\r\n    Italy, and enacted that not only those who gave entertainments\r\n    which exceeded in expense what the law had prescribed, but also\r\n    all who were present at such entertainments, should be liable to\r\n    the penalties of the law. We are not, however, told in what these\r\n    consisted.\r\n\r\n    LICINIA, agreed in its chief provisions with the Lex Fannia, and\r\n    was brought forward, we are told, that there might be the authority\r\n    of a new law upon the subject, inasmuch as the Lex Fannia was\r\n    beginning to be neglected. It allowed 200 asses to be spent on\r\n    entertainments upon marriage days, and on other days the same as\r\n    the Lex Fannia; also, that on ordinary days there should not be\r\n    served up more than three pounds of fresh, and one pound of salt\r\n    meat. It was probably passed in B.C. 103.\r\n\r\n    CORNELIA, a law of the dictator Sulla, B.C. 81, was enacted on\r\n    account of the neglect of the Fannian and Licinian Laws. Like\r\n    these, it regulated the expenses of entertainments. Extravagance in\r\n    funerals, which had been forbidden even in the Twelve Tables, was\r\n    also restrained by a law of Sulla.\r\n\r\n    AEMILIA, proposed by the consul Aemilius Lepidus, B.C. 78, did not\r\n    limit the expenses of entertainments, but the kind and quantity of\r\n    food that was to be used.\r\n\r\n    ANTIA, of uncertain date, proposed by Antius Resto, besides\r\n    limiting the expenses of entertainments, enacted that no actual\r\n    magistrate, or magistrate elect, should dine abroad anywhere except\r\n    at the houses of certain persons. This law however was little\r\n    observed; and we are told that Antius never dined out afterwards,\r\n    that he might not see his own law violated.\r\n\r\n    JULIA, proposed by the dictator C. Julius Caesar, enforced the\r\n    former sumptuary laws respecting entertainments which had fallen\r\n    into disuse. He stationed officers in the provision market to seize\r\n    upon all eatables forbidden by the law, and sometimes sent lictors\r\n    and soldiers to banquets to take everything which was not allowed\r\n    by the law.\r\n\r\n    JULIA, a lex of Augustus, allowed 200 sesterces to be expended\r\n    upon festivals on dies profesti, 300 on those of the calends,\r\n    ides, nones, and some other festive days, and 1000 upon marriage\r\n    feasts. There was also an edict of Augustus or Tiberius, by which\r\n    as much as from 300 to 2000 sesterces were allowed to be expended\r\n    upon entertainments, the increase being made with the hope of\r\n    securing thereby the observance of the law. Tiberius attempted to\r\n    check extravagance in banquets; and a senatusconsultum was passed\r\n    in his reign for the purpose of restraining luxury, which forbade\r\n    gold vases to be employed, except for sacred purposes, and also\r\n    prohibited the use of silk garments to men. This sumptuary law,\r\n    however, was but little observed. Some regulations on the subject\r\n    were also made by Nero and by succeeding emperors, but they appear\r\n    to have been of little or no avail in checking the increasing love\r\n    of luxury in dress and food.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TĂBELLĀRĬAE, the laws by which the ballot was introduced in voting\r\n    in the comitia. As to the ancient mode of voting at Rome, see\r\n    COMITIA, p. 107.\r\n\r\n    GABINIA, proposed by the tribune Gabinius B.C. 139, introduced the\r\n    ballot in the election of magistrates; whence Cicero calls the\r\n    tabella _vindex tacitae libertatis_.\r\n\r\n    CASSIA, proposed by the tribune L. Cassius Longinus B.C. 137,\r\n    introduced the ballot in the _judicium populi_, or cases tried in\r\n    the comitia by the whole body of the people, with the exception of\r\n    cases of perduellio.\r\n\r\n    PAPIRIA, proposed by the tribune C. Papirius Carbo, B.C. 131,\r\n    introduced the ballot in the enactment and repeal of laws.\r\n\r\n    CAELIA, proposed by C. Caelius Caldus, B.C. 107, introduced the\r\n    ballot in cases of perduellio, which had been excepted in the\r\n    Cassian law. There was also a law brought forward by Marius, B.C.\r\n    119, which, was intended to secure freedom and order in voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TARPĒIA ATERNĬA. [ATERNIA TARPEIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TĔRENTĪLĬA, proposed by the tribune C. Terentilius, B.C. 462, but\r\n  not carried, was a rogatio which had for its object an amendment of\r\n  the constitution, though in form it only attempted a limitation of\r\n  the imperium consulare. This rogatio probably led to the subsequent\r\n  legislation of the decemviri.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TESTĀMENTĀRĬAE. Various leges, such as the Cornelia, Falcidia,\r\n  Furia, and Voconia, regulated testamentary dispositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THŎRĬA, passed B.C. 121, concerned the public land in Italy as\r\n  far as the rivers Rubico and Macra, or all Italy except Cisalpine\r\n  Gaul, the public land in the province of Africa, the public land in\r\n  the territory of Corinth, and probably other public land besides.\r\n  It relieved a great part of the public land of the land-tax\r\n  (_vectigal_). Some considerable fragments of this lex have come\r\n  down to us, engraved on the back part of the same bronze tablet\r\n  which contained the Servilia Lex Judiciaria, and on Repetundae.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TĬTĬA, similar in its provisions to the Lex Publicia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TĬTĬA, DE TUTORIBUS. [JULIA ET TITIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRĒBONĬA, a plebiscitum proposed by L. Trebonius, B.C. 448, which\r\n  enacted that if the ten tribunes were not chosen before the comitia\r\n  were dissolved, those who were elected should not fill up the\r\n  number (_co-optare_), but that the comitia should be continued till\r\n  the ten were elected.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRĒBŌNĬA DE PRŌVINCIIS CONSULĀRĬBUS. (Plut. _Cat. Min._ 43; Liv.\r\n  _Epit._ 105.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRĬBŪNĬTĬA.

[AMBITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TULLIA DE LĒGĀTIŌNE LĪBĔRA. [LEGATUS, p. 224.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VĂLĔRĬAE, proposed by the consul P. Valerius Publicola, B.C. 508,\r\n  enacted, 1. That whoever attempted to obtain possession of royal\r\n  power should be devoted to the gods, together with his substance.\r\n  2. That whoever was condemned by the sentence of a magistrate to\r\n  be put to death, to be scourged, or to be fined, should possess\r\n  the right of appeal (_provocatio_) to the people. The patricians\r\n  possessed previously the right of appeal from the sentence of a\r\n  magistrate to their own council the curiae, and therefore this\r\n  law of Valerius probably related only to the plebeians, to whom\r\n  it gave the right of appeal to the plebeian tribes, and not to\r\n  the centuries. Hence the laws proposed by the Valerian family\r\n  respecting the right of appeal are always spoken of as one of\r\n  the chief safeguards of the liberty of the plebs. The right of\r\n  appeal did not extend beyond a mile from the city, where unlimited\r\n  imperium began, to which the patricians were just as much subject\r\n  as the plebeians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VĂLĔRĬAE ET HŎRĀTĬAE, three laws proposed by the consuls L.\r\n  Valerius and M. Horatius, B.C. 449, in the year after the\r\n  decemvirate, enacted, 1. That a plebiscitum should be binding on\r\n  the whole people, respecting the meaning of which expression, see\r\n  PLEBISCITUM. 2. That whoever should procure the election of a\r\n  magistrate without appeal should be outlawed, and might be killed\r\n  by any one with impunity. 3. Renewed the penalty threatened against\r\n  any one who should harm the tribunes and the aediles, to whom were\r\n  now added the judices and decemviri. There is considerable doubt as\r\n  to who are meant by the _judices_ and _decemviri_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VĂLĔRĬA, proposed by the consul M. Valerius, B.C. 300, re-enacted\r\n  for the third time the celebrated law of his family respecting\r\n  appeal (_provocatio_) from the decision of a magistrate. The law\r\n  specified no fixed penalty for its violation, leaving the judges to\r\n  determine what the punishment should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VĂRĬA. [MAJESTAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VĂTĪNĬA DE PRŌVINCIIS, was the enactment by which Julius Caesar\r\n  obtained the province of Gallia Cisalpina with Illyricum for\r\n  five years, to which the senate added Gallia Transalpina. This\r\n  plebiscitum was proposed by the tribune Vatinius. A Trebonia Lex\r\n  subsequently prolonged Caesar’s imperium for five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VĂTĪNĬA DE CŎLŌNIS, under which the Latina Colonia [LATINITAS] of\r\n  Novum-Comum in Gallia Cisalpina was planted, B.C. 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VĂTĪNIA DE REJECTIŌNE JŪDĬCUM. (Cic. _in Vatin._ 11.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  DE VI. [VIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VĬĀRĬA. A viaria lex which Cicero says the tribune C. Curio\r\n  talked of; but nothing more seems to be known of it. Some modern\r\n  writers speak of leges viariae, but there do not appear to be any\r\n  leges properly so called. The provisions as to roads in many of\r\n  the Agrarian laws were parts of such leges, and had no special\r\n  reference to roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VISELLĬA, made a Latinus who assumed the rights of an ingenuus\r\n  liable to prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VILLĬA ANNĀLIS. [LEX ANNALIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VŎCŌNIA, enacted on the proposal of Q. Voconius Saxa, a tribunus\r\n  plebis, B.C. 169. One provision of the lex was, that no person\r\n  who should be rated in the census at 100,000 sesterces (_centum\r\n  millia aeris_) after the census of that year, should make any\r\n  female (_virginem neve mulierem_) his heres. The lex allowed no\r\n  exceptions, even in favour of an only daughter. It applied simply\r\n  to testaments, and therefore a daughter or other female could\r\n  inherit ab intestato to any amount. The vestal virgins could make\r\n  women their heredes in all cases, which was the only exception to\r\n  the provisions of the lex. Another provision of the lex forbade\r\n  a person who was included in the census to give more in amount,\r\n  in the form of a legacy to any person, than the heres or heredes\r\n  should take. This provision secured something to the heres or\r\n  heredes, but still the provision was ineffectual, and the object of\r\n  the lex was only accomplished by the Lex Falcidia, B.C. 44, which\r\n  enacted that a testator should not give more than three-fourths in\r\n  legacies, thus securing a fourth to the heres.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĪBELLA, a small Roman silver coin, which existed in the early age\r\nof the city. The name was retained later as a proverbial expression\r\nfor a very small value. The _libella_ was equal in value to the old\r\nfull-weight _as_; and it seems most probable that the coin ceased\r\nbeing struck at the time of the reduction of the _as_, on account\r\nof the inconveniently small size which it would have assumed.\r\nThe _libella_ was subdivided into the _sembella_, its half, and\r\nthe _teruncius_, its quarter. Cicero uses these words to express\r\nfractions of an estate, with reference to the _denarius_ as the unit,\r\nthe _libella_ signifying 1-10th, and the _teruncius_ 1-40th of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĬBELLUS, the diminutive form of liber, signifies properly a little\r\nbook. It was distinguished from other kinds of writings, by being\r\nwritten like our books by pages, whereas other writings were written\r\n_transversa charta_. It was used by the Romans as a technical term\r\nin the following cases:--1. _Libelli accusatorum_ or _accusatorii_,\r\nthe written accusations which in some cases a plaintiff, after having\r\nreceived the permission to bring an action against a person, drew up,\r\nsigned, and sent to the judicial authorities. 2. _Libelli famosi_,\r\nlibels or pasquinades, intended to injure the character of persons.\r\nA law of the Twelve Tables inflicted very severe punishments on\r\nthose who composed defamatory writings. 3. _Libellus memorialis_,\r\na pocket or memorandum book. 4. _Libellus_ is used by the Roman\r\njurists as equivalent to _Oratio Principis_. 5. The word libellus was\r\nalso applied to a variety of writings, which in most cases probably\r\nconsisted of one page only; such as short letters, advertisements, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Writing Materials. (From a Painting at\r\nHerculaneum.)]\r\n\r\nLĬBER (βιβλίον), a book. The most common material on which books\r\nwere written by the Greeks and Romans, was the thin coats or rind\r\n(_liber_, whence the Latin name for a book) of the Egyptian papyrus.\r\nThis plant was called by the Egyptians Byblos (βύβλος), whence the\r\nGreeks derived their name for a book (βιβλίον). The papyrus-tree\r\ngrows in swamps to the height of ten feet and more, and paper\r\n(_charta_) was prepared from the thin coats or pellicles which\r\nsurround the plant. Next to the papyrus, parchment (_membrana_)\r\nwas the most common material for writing upon. It is said to have\r\nbeen invented by Eumenes II. king of Pergamus, in consequence of\r\nthe prohibition of the export of papyrus from Egypt by Ptolemy\r\nEpiphanes. It is probable, however, that Eumenes introduced only\r\nsome improvement in the manufacture of parchment, as Herodotus\r\nmentions writing on skins as common in his time, and says that the\r\nIonians had been accustomed to give the name of skins (διφθέραι) to\r\nbooks. The ancients wrote usually on only one side of the paper or\r\nparchment. The back of the paper, instead of being written upon, was\r\nusually stained with saffron colour or the cedrus, which produced a\r\nyellow colour. As paper and parchment were dear, it was frequently\r\nthe custom to erase or wash out writing of little importance, and\r\nto write upon the paper or parchment again, which was then called\r\n_Palimpsestus_ (παλιμψήστος). The paper or parchment was joined\r\ntogether so as to form one sheet, and when the work was finished, it\r\nwas rolled on a staff, whence it was called a _volumen_; and hence we\r\nhave the expression _evolvere librum_. When an author divided a work\r\ninto several books, it was usual to include only one book in a volume\r\nor roll, so that there was generally the same number of volumes as\r\nof books. In the papyri rolls found at Herculaneum, the stick on\r\nwhich the papyrus is rolled does not project from the papyrus, but\r\nis concealed by it. Usually, however, there were balls or bosses,\r\nornamented or painted, called _umbilici_ or _cornua_, which were\r\nfastened at each end of the stick and projected from the papyrus. The\r\nends of the roll were carefully cut, polished with pumice-stone and\r\ncoloured black; they were called the _geminae frontes_. The way in\r\nwhich a book was held while reading is shown in the following cut,\r\ntaken from a painting at Herculaneum. To protect the roll from injury\r\nit was frequently put into a parchment case, which was stained with\r\na purple colour or with the yellow of the Lutum. The title of the\r\nbook (_titulus_, _index_) was written on a small strip of papyrus or\r\nparchment with a light red colour (_coccum_ or _minium_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Book held by a crowned Poet. (From a Painting at\r\nHerculaneum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĪBĔRĀLĬA. [DIONYSIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĪBĔRI. [INGENUI; LIBERTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĪBERTUS, LĪBERTĪNUS. Freemen (_liberi_) were either _Ingenui_\r\n[INGENUI] or _Libertini_. _Libertini_ were those persons who\r\nhad been released from legal servitude. A manumitted slave was\r\n_Libertus_ (that is, _liberatus_) with reference to his master; with\r\nreference to the class to which he belonged after manumission, he was\r\n_Libertinus_. Respecting the mode in which a slave was manumitted,\r\nand his status after manumission, see MANUMISSIO.--At Athens, a\r\nliberated slave was called ἀπελεύθερος. When manumitted he did not\r\nobtain the citizenship, but was regarded as a _metoicus_ [METOICUS],\r\nand, as such, he had to pay not only the _metoicion_ μετοίκιον but\r\na triobolon in addition to it. His former master became his patron\r\nπροστάτης to whom he owed certain duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĬBĬTĪNĀRĬI. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĪBRA, _dim._ LĪBELLA σταθμός, a balance, a pair of scales. The\r\nprincipal parts of this instrument were, 1. The beam (_jugum_). 2.\r\nThe two scales, called in Greek τάλαντα, and in Latin _lances_.\r\nThe beam was made without a tongue, being held by a ring or other\r\nappendage (_ligula_, ῥῦμα) fixed in the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĪBRA or AS, a pound, the unit of weight among the Romans and\r\nItalians. The uncial division, which has been noticed in speaking\r\nof the coin As, was also applied to the weight.--(See Tables at the\r\nend.) The divisions of the ounce are given under UNCIA. Where the\r\nword _pondo_, or its abbreviations P. or POND., occur with a simple\r\nnumber, the weight understood is the _libra_. The name _libra_ was\r\nalso given to a measure of horn, divided into twelve equal parts\r\n(_unciae_) by lines marked on it, and used for measuring oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRĀRĬI, the name of slaves, who were employed by their masters\r\nin writing or copying, sometimes called _antiquarii_. They must be\r\ndistinguished from the Scribae publici, who were freemen [SCRIBAE],\r\nand also from the booksellers [BIBLIOPOLA], to both of whom this name\r\nwas also applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĪBRĀTOR, in general a person who examines things by a LIBRA;\r\nbut specially applied to two kinds of persons.--(1) _Libratores\r\naquae_, persons whose knowledge of hydrostatics was indispensable\r\nin the construction of aquaeducts, sewers, and other structures for\r\nthe purpose of conveying a fluid from one place to another.--(2)\r\n_Libratores_ in the armies were probably soldiers who attacked the\r\nenemy by hurling with their own hands (_librando_) lances or spears\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRĬPENS. [MANCIPIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLĬBURNA, LĬBURNĬCA, a light vessel, which derived its name from\r\nthe Liburni. The ships of this people were of great assistance to\r\nAugustus at the battle of Actium; and experience having shown their\r\nefficiency, vessels of a similar kind were built and called by the\r\nname of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICTOR, a public officer, who attended on the chief Roman\r\nmagistrates. The number which waited on the different magistrates\r\nis stated in the article FASCES. The office of lictor is said to\r\nhave been derived by Romulus from the Etruscans. The lictors went\r\nbefore the magistrates one by one in a line; he who went last or\r\nnext to the magistrate was called _proximus lictor_, to whom the\r\nmagistrate gave his commands; and as this lictor was always the\r\nprincipal one, we also find him called _primus lictor_. The lictors\r\nhad to inflict punishment on those who were condemned, especially\r\nin the case of Roman citizens; for foreigners and slaves were\r\npunished by the Carnifex; and they also probably had to assist in\r\nsome cases in the execution of a decree or judgment in a civil suit.\r\nThe lictors likewise commanded persons to pay proper respect to a\r\nmagistrate passing by, which consisted in dismounting from horseback,\r\nuncovering the head, standing out of the way, &c. The lictors were\r\noriginally chosen from the plebs, but afterwards appear to have been\r\ngenerally freedmen, probably of the magistrate on whom they attended.\r\nLictors were properly only granted to those magistrates who had the\r\nImperium. Consequently, the tribunes of the plebs never had lictors,\r\nnor several of the other magistrates. Sometimes, however, lictors\r\nwere granted to persons as a mark of respect or for the sake of\r\nprotection. Thus by a law of the Triumvirs every vestal virgin was\r\naccompanied by a lictor, whenever she went out, and the honour of\r\none or two lictors was usually granted to the wives and other female\r\nmembers of the Imperial family. There were also thirty lictors called\r\n_Lictores Curiati_, whose duty it was to summon the curiae to the\r\ncomitia curiata; and when these meetings became little more than a\r\nform, their suffrages were represented by the thirty lictors.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĬGŬLA, a Roman measure of fluid capacity, containing one-fourth\r\nof the CYATHUS. It signifies _a spoonful_, like _cochlear_; only\r\nthe _ligula_ was larger than the _cochlear_. The spoon which was\r\ncalled _ligula_, or _lingula_ (dim. of _lingua_) from its shape, was\r\nused for various purposes, especially to clean out small and narrow\r\nvessels, and to eat jellies and such things. The word is also used\r\nfor the leather tongue of a shoe.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĪMEN. [JANUA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLINTER, a light boat, frequently formed of the trunk of a tree, and\r\ndrawing little water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLĬTHOSTRŌTA. [DOMUS, p. 144.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLITRA λίτρα, a Sicilian silver coin, equal in value to the Aeginetan\r\nobol.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lituus, Augur’s Staff. (Centre figure from an Etruscan\r\nsculpture; the two others are Roman coins.)]\r\n\r\nLĬTUUS, probably an Etruscan word signifying _crooked_.--(1)\r\nThe crooked staff borne by the augurs, with which they divided\r\nthe expanse of heaven, when viewed with reference to divination\r\n(_templum_), into regions (_regiones_).--(2) A sort of trumpet\r\nslightly curved at the extremity. It differed both from the _tuba_\r\nand the _cornu_, the former being straight, while the latter was bent\r\nround into a spiral shape. Its tones are usually characterised as\r\nharsh and shrill. The Liticines, or blowers on the Lituus, formed a\r\nCollegium along with the Cornicines. [CORNU.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lituus, Trumpet. (From Fabretti.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIXAE. [CALONES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLŎCŬPLĒTES or ASSĬDŬI, the name of the Roman citizens included in\r\nthe five classes of the Servian constitution, and opposed to the\r\n_Proletarii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLŌDIX, a small shaggy blanket. It was also used as a carpet.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGISTAE. [EUTHYNE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lorica, as worn by a Greek Warrior. (From a Vase.)\r\n\r\nLorica, as worn by a Roman Emperor. (Statue of\r\nCaligula in Louvre.)]\r\n\r\nLŌRĪCA (θώραξ), a cuirass. The cuirass was worn by the heavy-armed\r\ninfantry both among the Greeks and Romans. The soldiers commonly\r\nwore cuirasses made of flexible bands of steel, or cuirasses of\r\nchain mail; but those of generals and officers usually consisted of\r\ntwo γύαλα, the breast-piece and back-piece, made of bronze, iron,\r\n&c., which were joined by means of buckles (περόναι). The epithets\r\nλεπιδωτός and φολιδωτός are applied to a cuirass; the former on\r\naccount of its resemblance to the scales of fish (λεπίσιν), the\r\nlatter to the scales of serpents (φολίσιν). Among the Asiatic nations\r\nthe cuirass was frequently made of cotton, and among the Sarmatians\r\nand other northern nations of horn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Lorica. λεπιδωτός.\r\n  Lorica. φολιδωτός.\r\n  (Bartoli, ‘Arcus Triumph.’)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLŪCAR. [HISTRIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLŪCĔRES. [TRIBUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lucerna, lamp. (Museo Borbonico, vol. iv. pl. 10.)]\r\n\r\nLŬCERNA (λύχνος), an oil lamp. The Greeks and Romans originally used\r\ncandles; but in later times candles were chiefly confined to the\r\nhouses of the lower classes. [CANDELA.] A great number of ancient\r\nlamps has come down to us; the greater part of which are made of\r\nterra cotta, but also a considerable number of bronze. Most of the\r\nlamps are of an oval form, and flat upon the top, on which there are\r\nfrequently figures in relief. In the lamps there are one or more\r\nround holes, according to the number of wicks (_ellychnia_) burnt\r\nin them; and as these holes were called from an obvious analogy,\r\nμυκτῆρες or μύξαι, literally nostrils or nozzles, the lamp was also\r\ncalled _Monomyxos_, _Dimyxos_, _Trimyxos_, or _Polymyxos_, according\r\nas it contained one, two, three, or a greater number of nozzles\r\nor holes for the wicks. The following is an example of a _dimyxos\r\nlucerna_, upon which there is a winged boy with a goose. The next\r\nwoodcut represents one of the most beautiful bronze lamps which has\r\nyet been found. Upon it is the figure of a standing Silenus. The\r\nlamps sometimes hung in chains from the ceiling of the room, but\r\nthey generally stood upon a stand. [CANDELABRUM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lucerna lamp. (Museo Borbonico, vol. i. pl 10.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCTA, LUCTĀTĬO (πάλη, πάλαισμα, παλαισμοσύνη, or καταβλητική),\r\nwrestling. The Greeks ascribed the invention of wrestling to mythical\r\npersonages, and Hermes, the god of all gymnastic exercises, also\r\npresided over wrestling. In the Homeric age wrestling was much\r\npractised: during this period wrestlers contended naked, and only\r\nthe loins were covered with the perizoma (περίζωμα), and this custom\r\nprobably remained throughout Greece until Ol. 15, from which time the\r\nperizoma was no longer used, and wrestlers contended entirely naked.\r\nIn the Homeric age the custom of anointing the body for the purpose\r\nof wrestling does not appear to have been known, but in the time of\r\nSolon it was quite general, and was said to have been adopted by the\r\nCretans and Lacedaemonians at a very early period. After the body was\r\nanointed, it was strewed over with sand or dust, in order to enable\r\nthe wrestlers to take a firm hold of each other. If one combatant\r\nthrew the other down three times, the victory was decided. Wrestling\r\nwas practised in all the great games of the Greeks. The most renowned\r\nwrestler was Milon, of Croton. [PANCRATIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLŪDI, the common name for the whole variety of games and contests\r\nwhich were held at Rome on various occasions, but chiefly at the\r\nfestivals of the gods; and as the ludi at certain festivals formed\r\nthe principal part of the solemnities, these festivals themselves are\r\ncalled ludi. Sometimes ludi were also held in honour of a magistrate\r\nor a deceased person, in which case they may be considered as ludi\r\nprivati. All ludi were divided by the Romans into two classes, _ludi\r\ncircenses_ and _ludi scenici_, accordingly as they were held in\r\nthe circus or in the theatre; in the latter case they were mostly\r\ntheatrical representations with their various modifications; in the\r\nformer they consisted of all or of a part of the games enumerated\r\nin the articles CIRCUS and GLADIATORES. Another division of the\r\nludi into _stati_, _imperativi_, and _votivi_, is analogous to the\r\ndivision of the feriae. [FERIAE.] The superintendence of the games,\r\nand the solemnities connected with them, was in most cases intrusted\r\nto the aediles. [AEDILES.] If the lawful rites were not observed in\r\nthe celebration of the ludi, it depended upon the decision of the\r\npontiffs whether they were to be held again (_instaurari_) or not. An\r\nalphabetical list of the principal ludi is subjoined.\r\n\r\nLUDI APOLLINARES were instituted at Rome during the second Punic\r\nwar, after the battle of Cannae (212 B.C.), at the command of an\r\noracle contained in the books of the ancient seer Marcius, in order\r\nto obtain the aid of Apollo. They were held every year under the\r\nsuperintendence of the praetor urbanus, and ten men sacrificed to\r\nApollo, according to Greek rites, a bull with gilt horns and two\r\nwhite goats also with gilt horns, and to Latona a heifer with gilt\r\nhorns. The games themselves were held in the Circus Maximus, the\r\nspectators were adorned with chaplets, and each citizen gave a\r\ncontribution towards defraying the expenses. In B.C. 208, it was\r\nordained that they should always be celebrated on the 6th of July.\r\n\r\nLUDI AUGUSTALES. [AUGUSTALES.]\r\n\r\nLUDI CAPITOLINI were instituted B.C. 387, after the departure\r\nof the Gauls from Rome, as a token of gratitude towards Jupiter\r\nCapitolinus, who had saved the Capitol in the hour of danger. The\r\nsuperintendence of the games was entrusted to a college of priests\r\ncalled _Capitolini_.\r\n\r\nLUDI CIRCENSES, ROMANI or MAGNI, were celebrated every year during\r\nseveral days, from the fourth to the twelfth of September, in\r\nhonour of the three great divinities, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva,\r\nor, according to others, in honour of Jupiter, Consus, and Neptunus\r\nEquestris. They were superintended by the curule aediles. For further\r\nparticulars see CIRCUS.\r\n\r\nLUDI COMPITALICII. [COMPITALIA.]\r\n\r\nLUDI FLORALES. [FLORALIA.]\r\n\r\nLUDI FUNEBRES were games celebrated at the funeral pyre of\r\nillustrious persons. Such games are mentioned in the very early\r\nlegends of the history of Greece and Rome, and they continued with\r\nvarious modifications until the introduction of Christianity. It was\r\nat such a ludus funebris, in B.C. 264, that gladiatorial fights were\r\nexhibited at Rome for the first time, which henceforwards were the\r\nmost essential part in all funeral games. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\nLUDI LIBERALES. [DIONYSIA.]\r\n\r\nLUDI MEGALENSES. [MEGALESIA.]\r\n\r\nLUDI PLEBEII were instituted probably in commemoration of the\r\nreconciliation between the patricians and plebeians after the\r\nfirst secession to the Mons Sacer, or, according to others, to the\r\nAventine. They were held on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of November, and\r\nwere conducted by the plebeian aediles.\r\n\r\nLUDI SAECULARES. During the time of the republic these games were\r\ncalled _ludi Tarentini_, _Terentini_, or _Taurii_, and it was\r\nnot till the time of Augustus that they bore the name of _ludi\r\nsaeculares_. The names _Tarenti_ or _Taurii_ are perhaps nothing but\r\ndifferent forms of the same word, and of the same root as Tarquinius.\r\nThere were various accounts respecting the origin of the games,\r\nyet all agree in stating that they were celebrated for the purpose\r\nof averting from the state some great calamity by which it had been\r\nafflicted, and that they were held in honour of Dis and Proserpina.\r\nFrom the time of the consul Valerius Publicola down to that of\r\nAugustus, the Tarentine games were held only three times, and again\r\nonly on certain emergencies, and not at any fixed period, so that\r\nwe must conclude that their celebration was in no way connected\r\nwith certain cycles of time (_saecula_). Not long after Augustus\r\nhad assumed the supreme power in the republic, the quindecimviri\r\nannounced that according to their books _ludi saeculares_ ought to\r\nbe held, and at the same time tried to prove from history that in\r\nformer times they had not only been celebrated repeatedly, but almost\r\nregularly once in every century. The festival, however, which was\r\nnow held, was in reality very different from the ancient Tarentine\r\ngames; for Dis and Proserpina, to whom formerly the festival belonged\r\nexclusively, were now the last in the list of the divinities in\r\nhonour of whom the ludi saeculares were celebrated. The festival\r\ntook place in summer, and lasted for three days and three nights.\r\nOn the first day the games commenced in that part of the Campus\r\nMartius, Which had belonged to the last Tarquin, from whom it derived\r\nits name Tarentum, and sacrifices were offered to Jupiter, Juno,\r\nNeptune, Minerva, Venus, Apollo, Mercury, Ceres, Vulcan, Mars, Diana,\r\nVesta, Hercules, Latona, the Parcae, and to Dis and Proserpina. The\r\nsolemnities began at the second hour of the night, and the emperor\r\nopened them by the river side with the sacrifice of three lambs to\r\nthe Parcae upon three altars erected for the purpose, and which\r\nwere sprinkled with the blood of the victims. The lambs themselves\r\nwere burnt. A temporary scene like that of a theatre was erected in\r\nthe Tarentum, and illuminated with lights and fires. In this scene\r\nfestive hymns were sung by a chorus, and various other ceremonies,\r\ntogether with theatrical performances, took place. During the morning\r\nof the first day the people went to the Capitol to offer solemn\r\nsacrifices to Jupiter; thence they returned to the Tarentum, to sing\r\nchoruses in honour of Apollo and Diana. On the second day the noblest\r\nmatrons, at an hour fixed by an oracle, assembled in the Capitol,\r\noffered supplications, sang hymns to the gods, and also visited the\r\naltar of Juno. The emperor and the quindecimviri offered sacrifices\r\nwhich had been vowed before, to all the great divinities. On the\r\nthird day Greek and Latin choruses were sung in the sanctuary of\r\nApollo by three times nine boys and maidens of great beauty, whose\r\nparents were still alive. The object of these hymns was to implore\r\nthe protection of the gods for all cities, towns, and officers\r\nof the empire. One of these hymns was the _carmen saeculare_ by\r\nHorace, which was especially composed for the occasion and adapted\r\nto the circumstances of the time. During the whole of the three\r\ndays and nights, games of every description were carried on in all\r\nthe circuses and theatres, and sacrifices were offered in all the\r\ntemples. The first celebration of the ludi saeculares in the reign of\r\nAugustus took place in the summer of B.C. 17.\r\n\r\nLUDI TARENTINI or TAURII. [LUDI SAECULARES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLŪDUS. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLŪDUS TRŌJAE. [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLŬPERCĀLĬA, one of the most ancient Roman festivals, which was\r\ncelebrated every year in honour of Lupercus, the god of fertility.\r\nIt was originally a shepherd-festival, and hence its introduction at\r\nRome was connected with the names of Romulus and Remus, the kings of\r\nshepherds. It was held every year, on the 15th of February, in the\r\nLupercal, where Romulus and Remus were said to have been nurtured\r\nby the she-wolf; the place contained an altar and a grove sacred\r\nto the god Lupercus. Here the Luperci assembled on the day of the\r\nLupercalia, and sacrificed to the god goats and young dogs. Two\r\nyouths of noble birth were then led to the Luperci, and one of the\r\nlatter touched their foreheads with a sword dipped in the blood of\r\nthe victims; other Luperci immediately after wiped off the bloody\r\nspots with wool dipped in milk. Hereupon the two youths were obliged\r\nto break out into a shout of laughter. This ceremony was probably a\r\nsymbolical purification of the shepherds. After the sacrifice was\r\nover, the Luperci partook of a meal, at which they were plentifully\r\nsupplied with wine. They then cut the skins of the goats which they\r\nhad sacrificed, into pieces: with some of which they covered parts of\r\ntheir body in imitation of the god Lupercus, who was represented half\r\nnaked and half covered with goatskin. The other pieces of the skins\r\nthey cut in the shape of thongs, and holding them in their hands they\r\nran with them through the streets of the city, touching or striking\r\nwith them all persons whom they met in their way, and especially\r\nwomen, who even used to come forward voluntarily for the purpose,\r\nsince they believed that this ceremony rendered them fruitful,\r\nand procured them an easy delivery in child-bearing. This act of\r\nrunning about with thongs of goatskin was a symbolic purification\r\nof the land, and that of touching persons a purification of men,\r\nfor the words by which this act is designated are _februare_ and\r\n_lustrare_. The goatskin itself was called _februum_, the festive\r\nday _dies februata_, the month in which it occurred _Februarius_,\r\nand the god himself _Februus_. The festival of the Lupercalia,\r\nthough it necessarily lost its original import at the time when the\r\nRomans were no longer a nation of shepherds, was yet always observed\r\nin commemoration of the founders of the city. M. Antonius, in his\r\nconsulship, was one of the Luperci, and not only ran with them half\r\nnaked and covered with pieces of goatskin through the city, but even\r\naddressed the people in the forum in this rude attire.\r\n\r\n\r\nLŬPERCI, the priests of the god Lupercus. They formed a college,\r\nthe members of which were originally youths of patrician families,\r\nand which was said to have been instituted by Romulus and Remus.\r\nThe college was divided into two classes, the one called _Fabii_\r\nor _Fabiani_, and the other _Quinctilii_ or _Quinctiliani_. The\r\noffice was not for life, but how long it lasted is not known. Julius\r\nCaesar added to the two classes of the college a third with the\r\nname of _Julii_ or _Juliani_, and made Antonius their high-priest.\r\nHe also assigned to them certain revenues (_vectigalia_) which were\r\nafterwards withdrawn from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLŬPUS FERREUS, the iron wolf used by the besieged in repelling the\r\nattacks of the besiegers, and especially in seizing the battering-ram\r\nand diverting its blows.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUSTRĀTĬO (κάθαρσις) was originally a purification by ablution in\r\nwater. But the lustrations of which we possess direct knowledge are\r\nalways connected with sacrifices and other religious rites, and\r\nconsisted in the sprinkling of water by means of a branch of laurel\r\nor olive, and at Rome sometimes by means of the aspergillum, and in\r\nthe burning of certain materials, the smoke of which was thought to\r\nhave a purifying effect. Whenever sacrifices were offered, it seems\r\nto have been customary to carry them around the person or thing to be\r\npurified. Lustrations were made in ancient Greece, and probably at\r\nRome also, by private individuals when they had polluted themselves\r\nby any criminal action. Whole cities and states also sometimes\r\nunderwent purifications to expiate the crime or crimes committed by\r\na member of the community. The most celebrated purification of this\r\nkind was that of Athens, performed by Epimenides of Crete, after the\r\nCylonian massacre. Purification also took place when a sacred spot\r\nhad been unhallowed by profane use, as by burying dead bodies in\r\nit, as was the case with the island of Delos. The Romans performed\r\nlustrations on many occasions, on which the Greeks did not think of\r\nthem; and the object of most Roman lustrations was not to atone for\r\nthe commission of crime, but to obtain the blessing of the gods upon\r\nthe persons or things which were lustrated. Thus fields were purified\r\nafter the business of sowing was over, and before the sickle was put\r\nto the corn. [ARVALES FRATRES.] Sheep were purified every year at the\r\nfestival of the Palilia. All Roman armies before they took the field\r\nwere lustrated; and as the solemnity was probably always connected\r\nwith a review of the troops, the word lustratio is also used in the\r\nsense of the modern review. The establishment of a new colony was\r\nalways preceded by a lustratio with solemn sacrifices. The city of\r\nRome itself, as well as other towns within its dominion, always\r\nunderwent a lustratio after they had been visited by some great\r\ncalamity, such as civil bloodshed, awful prodigies, and the like. A\r\nregular and general lustratio of the whole Roman people took place\r\nafter the completion of every lustrum, when the censor had finished\r\nhis census and before he laid down his office. This lustratio (also\r\ncalled lustrum) was conducted by one of the censors, and held with\r\nsacrifices called _Suovetaurilia_, because the sacrifices consisted\r\nof a pig (or ram), a sheep, and an ox. It took place in the Campus\r\nMartius, where the people assembled for the purpose. The sacrifices\r\nwere carried three times around the assembled multitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUSTRUM (from _luo_, Gr. λούω) is properly speaking a lustration or\r\npurification, and in particular the purification of the whole Roman\r\npeople performed by one of the censors in the Campus Martius, after\r\nthe business of the census was over. [CENSUS; LUSTRATIO.] As this\r\npurification took place only once in five years, the word lustrum\r\nwas also used to designate the time between two lustra. The first\r\nlustrum was performed in B.C. 566, by king Servius, after he had\r\ncompleted his census, and it is said to have taken place subsequently\r\nevery five years, after the census was over. The census might be held\r\nwithout the lustrum, and indeed two cases of this kind are recorded\r\nwhich happened in B.C. 459 and 214. In these cases the lustrum was\r\nnot performed on account of some great calamities which had befallen\r\nthe republic. The time when the lustrum took place has been very\r\ningeniously defined by Niebuhr. Six ancient Romulian years of 304\r\ndays each were, with the difference of one day, equal to five solar\r\nyears of 365 days each, or the six ancient years made 1824 days,\r\nwhile the five solar years contained 1825 days. The lustrum, or the\r\ngreat year of the ancient Romans, was thus a cycle, at the end of\r\nwhich the beginning of the ancient year nearly coincided with that\r\nof the solar year. As the coincidence, however, was not perfect, a\r\nmonth of 24 days was intercalated in every eleventh lustrum. Now\r\nit is highly probable that the recurrence of such a cycle or great\r\nyear was, from the earliest times, solemnised with sacrifices and\r\npurifications, and that Servius Tullius did not introduce them, but\r\nmerely connected them with his census, and thus set the example for\r\nsubsequent ages. Many writers of the latter period of the republic\r\nand during the empire, use the word lustrum for any space of five\r\nyears, and without any regard to the census, while others even apply\r\nit in the sense of the Greek pentaeteris or an Olympiad, which\r\ncontained only four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nLỸCAEA (λύκαια), a festival with contests, celebrated by the\r\nArcadians in honour of Zeus surnamed Λυκαῖος. It was said to have\r\nbeen instituted by the ancient hero Lycaon, the son of Pelasgus, who\r\nis also said, instead of the cakes which had formerly been offered to\r\nthe god, to have sacrificed a child to Zeus, and to have sprinkled\r\nthe altar with its blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lyre with four strings, from a Lycian coin. (Cabinet\r\nof Sir Charles Fellows.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lyre with seven strings, from a coin of Chalcis.\r\n(British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nLỸRA (λύρα, Lat. _fides_), a lyre, one of the most ancient musical\r\ninstruments of the stringed kind. The Greeks attributed the invention\r\nof the lyre to Hermes, who is said to have formed the instrument of\r\na tortoise-shell, over which he placed gut-strings. The name λύρα,\r\nhowever, does not occur in the Homeric poems, and the ancient lyre,\r\ncalled in Homer _phorminx_ (φόρμιγξ) and _citharis_ (κίθαρις), seems\r\nrather to have resembled the _cithara_ of later times, which was in\r\nsome respects like a modern guitar. In the cithara the strings were\r\ndrawn across the bottom, whereas in the lyra of ancient times they\r\nwere free on both sides. The lyre is also called χέλυς or χελώνη, and\r\nin Latin _testudo_, because it was made of a tortoise-shell. The lyre\r\nhad originally three or four strings, but after the time of Terpander\r\nof Antissa (about B.C. 650), who is said to have added three more, it\r\nwas generally made with seven. The ancients, however, made use of a\r\nvariety of lyres; and about the time of Sappho and Anacreon several\r\nstringed instruments, such as _magadis_, _barbiton_, and others, were\r\nused in Greece, and especially in Lesbos. They had been introduced\r\nfrom Asia Minor, and their number of strings far exceeded that of the\r\nlyre, for we know that some had even twenty strings, so that they\r\nmust have more resembled a modern harp than a lyre. But the lyra and\r\ncithara had in most cases no more than seven strings. The lyre had\r\na great and full-sounding bottom, which continued as before to be\r\nmade generally of tortoise-shell, from which the horns rose as from\r\nthe head of a stag. A transverse piece of wood connecting the two\r\nhorns at or near their top-ends served to fasten the strings, and\r\nwas called ζύγον, and in Latin _transtillum_. The horns were called\r\nπήχεις or _cornua_. These instruments were often adorned in the\r\nmost costly manner with gold and ivory. The lyre was considered as\r\na more manly instrument than the cithara, which, on account of its\r\nsmaller-sounding bottom, excluded full-sounding and deep tones, and\r\nwas more calculated for the middle tones. The lyre when played stood\r\nin an upright position between the knees, while the cithara stood\r\nupon the knees of the player. Both instruments were held with the\r\nleft hand, and played with the right. It has generally been supposed\r\nthat the strings of these instruments were always touched with a\r\nlittle staff called _plectrum_ (πλῆκτρον), but among the paintings\r\ndiscovered at Herculaneum we find several instances where the persons\r\nplay the lyre with their fingers. The lyre was at all times only\r\nplayed as an accompaniment to songs. The Latin name _fides_, which\r\nwas used for a lyre as well as a cithara, is probably the same as\r\nthe Greek σφίδες, which signifies gut-string. The lyre (_cithara_\r\nor _phorminx_) was at first used in the recitations of epic poetry,\r\nthough it was probably not played during the recitation itself, but\r\nonly as a prelude before the minstrel commenced his story, and in the\r\nintervals or pauses between the several parts. The lyre has given its\r\nname to a species of poetry called lyric; this kind of poetry was\r\noriginally never recited or sung without the accompaniment of the\r\nlyre, and sometimes also of an appropriate dance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anacreon playing the lyre. (Vase-painting in the\r\nBritish Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAENIĀNUM, signified, originally, a projecting balcony, which was\r\nerected round the Roman forum, by the censor, C. Maenius, B.C.\r\n318, in order to give more accommodation to the spectators of the\r\ngladiatorial combats. Hence balconies in general came to be called\r\n_maeniana_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĂGĂDIS. [LYRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĂGISTER., which contains the same root as _mag-is_ and _mag-nus_,\r\nwas applied at Rome to persons possessing various kinds of offices,\r\nand especially to the leading person in a collegium or corporation\r\n[COLLEGIUM]; thus the _magister societatis_ was the president of the\r\ncorporation of equites, who farmed the taxes at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĂGISTER ĔQUITUM. [DICTATOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĂGISTRĀTUS was a person _qui juri dicundo praeerat_. The King was\r\noriginally the sole Magistratus; he had all the Potestas. On the\r\nexpulsion of the Kings, two Consuls were annually appointed, and they\r\nwere Magistratus. In course of time other Magistratus were appointed;\r\nnamely, dictators, censors, praetors, aediles, tribunes of the plebs,\r\nand the decemviri litibus judicandis. The governors of provinces with\r\nthe title of propraetor or proconsul were also Magistratus. The word\r\nMagistratus contains the same element as _mag(ister)_ and _mag(nus)_;\r\nand it signifies both the person and the office, as we see in the\r\nphrase _se magistratu abdicare_. The auspicia maxima belonged to the\r\nconsuls, praetors, and censors, and the minora auspicia to the other\r\nmagistrates; accordingly the consuls, praetors, and censors were\r\ncalled _Majores_, and they were elected at the comitia centuriata;\r\nthe other magistratus were called _Minores_. The former had the\r\nimperium, the latter had not. The magistratus were also divided into\r\ncurules and those who were not curules: the magistratus curules were\r\nthe dictator, consuls, praetors, censors, and the curule aediles,\r\nwho were so called, because they had the jus sellae curulis. The\r\nmagistrates were chosen only from the patricians in the early\r\nrepublic, but in course of time the plebeians shared these honours,\r\nwith the exception of that of the Interrex: the plebeian magistratus,\r\nproperly so called, were the plebeian aediles and the tribuni plebis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJESTAS pretty nearly corresponds to treason in English law; but\r\nall the offences included under majestas comprehend more than the\r\nEnglish treason. One of the offences included in majestas was the\r\neffecting, aiding in, or planning the death of a magistratus populi\r\nRomani, or of one who had imperium or potestas. Though the phrase\r\n_crimen majestatis_ was used, the complete expression was _crimen\r\nlaesae_, _imminutae_, _diminutae_, or _minutae majestatis_. The word\r\nmajestas, consistently with its relation to _mag(nus)_, signifies\r\nthe magnitude or greatness of a thing. Accordingly, the phrases\r\n_majestas populi Romani_, _imperii majestas_, signify the whole of\r\nthat which constituted the Roman state; in other words, the sovereign\r\npower of the Roman state. The expression _minuere majestatem_\r\nconsequently signifies any act by which this majestas is impaired.\r\nIn the republican period the term _majestas laesa_ or _minuta_ was\r\nmost commonly applied to cases of a general betraying or surrendering\r\nhis army to the enemy, exciting sedition, and generally by his bad\r\nconduct in administration impairing the majestas of the state. The\r\nold punishment of majestas was perpetual interdiction from fire and\r\nwater. In the later imperial period, persons of low condition were\r\nthrown to wild beasts, or burnt alive; persons of better condition\r\nwere simply put to death. In the early times of the republic, every\r\nact of a citizen which was injurious to the state or its peace was\r\ncalled _perduellio_, and the offender (_perduellis_) was tried before\r\nthe populus (_populi judicio_), and, if convicted, put to death.\r\n_Perduellis_ originally signified _hostis_; and thus the old offence\r\nof perduellio was equivalent to making war on the Roman state. The\r\ntrial for perduellio (_perduellionis judicium_) existed to the later\r\ntimes of the republic; but the name seems to have almost fallen into\r\ndisuse, and various leges were passed for the purpose of determining\r\nmore accurately what should be majestas. These were a lex Apuleia,\r\nprobably passed in the fifth consulship of Marius, the exact contents\r\nof which are unknown, a lex Varia B.C. 91, a lex Cornelia passed by\r\nL. Cornelius Sulla, and the lex Julia, which continued under the\r\nempire to be the fundamental enactment on this subject. This lex\r\nJulia is by some attributed to C. Julius Caesar, and assigned to\r\nthe year B.C. 48. Under the empire the term majestas was applied to\r\nthe person of the reigning Caesar, and we find the phrases majestas\r\nAugusta, imperatoria, and regia. It was, however, nothing new to\r\napply the term to the emperor, considered in some of his various\r\ncapacities, for it was applied to the magistratus under the republic,\r\nas to the consul and praetor. Horace even addresses Augustus in the\r\nterms _majestas tua_, but this can hardly be viewed otherwise than as\r\na personal compliment, and not as said with reference to any of the\r\noffices which he held.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLĔŎLUS, a hammer, the transverse head of which was formed for\r\nholding pitch and tow, which, having been set on fire, was projected\r\nslowly, so that it might not be extinguished during its flight, upon\r\nhouses and other buildings in order to set them on fire: it was\r\ntherefore commonly used in sieges together with torches and falaricae.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĀLUS. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMANCEPS has the same relation to Mancipium that Auspex has to\r\nAuspicium. It is properly _qui manu capit_. But the word has several\r\nspecial significations. Mancipes were they who bid at the public\r\nlettings of the censors for the purpose of farming any part of the\r\npublic property. Sometimes the chief of the publicani generally are\r\nmeant by this term, as they were no doubt the bidders and gave\r\nthe security, and then they shared the undertaking with others or\r\nunderlet it. The mancipes would accordingly have distinctive names\r\naccording to the kind of revenue which they took on lease, as\r\n_Decumani_, _Portitores_, _Pecuarii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANCĬPĀTĬO. [MANCIPIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMANCĬPĬUM, MANCĬPĀTIO. These words are used to indicate the\r\nformal transfer of the ownership of a thing, and are derived from\r\nthe fact that the person who received the thing took hold of it\r\n(_mancipatio dicitur quia manu res capitur_). It was not a simple\r\ncorporeal apprehension, but one which was accompanied with certain\r\nforms described by Gaius the jurist:--“Mancipatio is effected in\r\nthe presence of not less than five witnesses, who must be Roman\r\ncitizens and of the age of puberty (_puberes_), and also in the\r\npresence of another person of the same status, who holds a pair of\r\nbrazen scales, and hence is called _Libripens_. The purchaser (_qui\r\nmancipio accipit_), taking hold of the thing, says: I affirm that\r\nthis slave (_homo_) is mine Ex Jure Quiritium, and he is purchased\r\nby me with this piece of money (_aes_) and brazen scales. He then\r\nstrikes the scales with the piece of money, and gives it to the\r\nseller as a symbol of the price (_quasi pretii loco_).” This mode of\r\ntransfer applied to all free persons or slaves, animals or lands,\r\nall of which persons and things were called _Res Mancipi_; other\r\nthings were called _Nec Mancipi_. Lands (_praedia_) might be thus\r\ntransferred, though the parties to the mancipatio were not on the\r\nlands; but all other things, which were objects of mancipatio, were\r\nonly transferable in the presence of the parties, because corporeal\r\napprehension was a necessary part of the ceremony. The party who\r\ntransferred the ownership of a thing pursuant to these forms was\r\nsaid _mancipio dare_; he who thus acquired the ownership was said\r\n_mancipio accipere_. The verb _mancipare_ is sometimes used as\r\nequivalent to _mancipio dare_. Mancipium may be used as equivalent\r\nto complete ownership, and may thus be opposed to _usus_ and to\r\n_fructus_. Sometimes the word mancipium signifies a slave, as being\r\none of the res mancipi.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANDĀTUM, often signifies a command from a superior to an inferior.\r\nUnder the empire the mandata principum were the commands and\r\ninstructions given to governors of provinces and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĂNĬPŬLUS. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMANSĬO σταθμός, a post-station at the end of a day’s journey. The\r\nword is derived from _manere_, signifying to pass the night at a\r\nplace in travelling. On the great Roman roads the mansiones were\r\nat the same distance from one another as on those of the Persian\r\nempire, where such resting-places (khans or caravanseras) were first\r\nprovided, viz. at intervals of about 20 English miles. They were\r\noriginally called _castra_, being probably mere places of encampment\r\nformed by making earthen entrenchments. In process of time they\r\nincluded, not only barracks and magazines of provisions (_horrea_)\r\nfor the troops, but commodious buildings adapted for the reception\r\nof travellers of all ranks, and even of the emperor himself, if he\r\nshould have occasion to visit them. At those stations the cisiarii\r\nkept gigs for hire and for conveying government despatches. [CISIUM;\r\nESSEDUM.] The _mansio_ was under the superintendence of an officer\r\ncalled _mansionarius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĂNŬBĬAE. [SPOLIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĂNŪMISSĬO was the form by which slaves were released from slavery.\r\nThere were three modes by which this was effected, namely, Vindicta,\r\nCensus, and Testamentum. Of these the manumissio by vindicta\r\nis probably the oldest, and perhaps was once the only mode of\r\nmanumission. It is mentioned by Livy as in use at an early period;\r\nand, indeed, he states that some persons refer the origin of the\r\nvindicta to the event which he relates, and derive its name from\r\nVindicius; the latter part, at least, of the supposition is of\r\nno value. The ceremony of the manumissio by the vindicta was as\r\nfollows:--The master brought his slave before the magistratus, and\r\nstated the grounds (_causa_) of the intended manumission. The lictor\r\nof the magistratus laid a rod (_festuca_) on the head of the slave,\r\naccompanied with certain formal words, in which he declared that he\r\nwas a freeman ex jure quiritium, that is, _vindicavit in libertatem_.\r\nThe master in the meantime held the slave, and after he had\r\npronounced the words _hunc hominem liberum volo_, he turned him round\r\nand let him go (_emisit e manu_), whence the general name of the\r\nact of manumission. The word vindicta itself, which is properly the\r\nres _vindicata_, is used for festuca by Horace. In the case of the\r\ncensus the slave was registered by the censors as a citizen with his\r\nmaster’s consent. The third mode of manumission was, when a master\r\ngave liberty to a slave by his will (_testamentum_). The act of\r\nmanumission established the relation of patronus and libertus between\r\nthe manumissor and the manumitted. When manumitted by a citizen, the\r\nlibertus took the praenomen and the gentile name of the manumissor,\r\nand became in a sense a member of the gens of his patron. To these\r\ntwo names he added some other name as a cognomen, either some name by\r\nwhich he was previously known, or some name assumed on the occasion:\r\nthus we find the names M. Tullius Tiro, P. Terentius Afer, and other\r\nlike names. The relation between a patronus and libertus is stated\r\nunder PATRONUS. Before the year B.C. 311, the libertini had not the\r\nsuffragium, but in that year the censor Appius Claudius gave the\r\nlibertini a place in the tribes, and from this time the libertini\r\nhad the suffragium after they were duly admitted on the censors’\r\nroll. In the year B.C. 304, they were placed in the tribus urbanae,\r\nand not allowed to perform military service. In the censorship of\r\nTiberius Gracchus, B.C. 169, they were placed in one of the tribus\r\nurbanae, determined by lot. Subsequently, by a law of Aemilius\r\nScaurus, about B.C. 116, they were restored to the four city tribes,\r\nand this remained their condition to the end of the republic, though\r\nvarious attempts were made to give them a better suffrage. A tax was\r\nlevied on manumission by a lex Manlia, B.C. 357: it consisted of the\r\ntwentieth part of the value of the slave, hence called _Vicesima_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĂNUS FERREA. [HARPAGO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSŪPĬUM (μαρσύπιον, βαλάντιον), a purse. The purse used by the\r\nancients was commonly a small leathern bag, and was often closed by\r\nbeing drawn together at the mouth (σύσπαστα βαλάντια). Mercury is\r\ncommonly represented holding one in his hand. (See cut, p. 63.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTỸRĬA (μαρτύρια), signifies strictly the deposition of a witness\r\nin a court of justice, though the word is applied metaphorically\r\nto all kinds of testimony. At Athens none but freemen could be\r\nwitnesses. The incapacity of women may be inferred from the general\r\npolicy of the Athenian law, and the absence of any example in the\r\norators where a woman’s evidence is produced. The same observation\r\napplies to minors. Slaves were not allowed to give evidence, unless\r\nupon examination by torture (βάσανος). Citizens who had been\r\ndisfranchised (ἠτιμωμένοι) could not appear as witnesses (any more\r\nthan as jurors or plaintiffs) in a court of justice; for they had\r\nlost all honourable rights and privileges. But there was no objection\r\nto alien freemen. The party who desired the evidence of a witness,\r\nsummoned him to attend for that purpose. The summons was called\r\nπρόσκλησις. If the witness promised to attend and failed to do so,\r\nhe was liable to an action called δίκη λειπομαρτυρίου. Whether he\r\npromised or not, he was bound to attend, and if his absence caused\r\ninjury to the party, he was liable to an action (δίκη βλάβης). The\r\nattendance of the witness was first required at the ἀνάκρισις, where\r\nhe was to make his deposition before the superintending magistrate\r\n(ἡγεμὼν δικαστηρίου). The party in whose favour he appeared,\r\ngenerally wrote the deposition at home upon a whitened board or\r\ntablet (λελευκωμένον γραμματεῖον), which he brought with him to the\r\nmagistrate’s office, and, when the witness had deposed thereto, put\r\ninto the box (ἐχῖνος) in which all the documents in the cause were\r\ndeposited. An oath was usually taken by the witness at the ἀνάκρισις,\r\nwhere he was sworn by the opposite party at an altar. The witness,\r\nwhether he had attended before the magistrate or not, was obliged to\r\nbe present at the trial, in order to confirm his testimony. The only\r\nexception was, when he was ill or out of the country, in which case a\r\ncommission might be sent to examine him. [ECMARTYRIA.] All evidence\r\nwas produced by the party during his own speech, the κλεψύδρα being\r\nstopped for that purpose. The witness was called by an officer of the\r\ncourt, and mounted on the raised platform (βῆμα.) of the speaker,\r\nwhile his deposition was read over to him by the clerk; he then\r\nsignified his assent, either by express words, or bowing his head in\r\nsilence.--We conclude by noticing a few expressions. Μαρτυρεῖν τινι\r\nis to testify in favour of a man, καταμαρτυρεῖν τινος to testify\r\nagainst. Μαρτύρεσθαι to call to witness (a word used poetically),\r\nδιαμαρτύρεσθαι and sometimes ἐπιμαρτύρεσθαι τοὺς παρόντας, to call\r\nupon those who are present to take notice of what passes, with a\r\nview to give evidence. Ψευδομαρτυρεῖν and ἐπιορκεῖν are never used\r\nindifferently, which affords some proof that testimony was not\r\nnecessarily on oath. The μάρτυς (witness in the cause) is to be\r\ndistinguished from the κλητὴρ or κλήτωρ, who merely gave evidence of\r\nthe summons to appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTĪGŎPHŎRI or MASTĪGŎNOMI (μαστιγοφόροι or μαστιγονόμοι), the\r\nname of the lower police officers in the Greek states, who carried\r\ninto execution the corporal punishments inflicted by the higher\r\nmagistrates. In the theatre the mastigophori preserved order, and\r\nwere stationed for this purpose in the orchestra, near the thymele.\r\nIn the Olympic games the ῥαβδοῦχοι performed the same duties. At\r\nAthens they were discharged by the public slaves, called bowmen\r\n(τοξόται), or Scythians (Σκύθαι). [DEMOSII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĀTERFĂMĬLĬAS. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMATRĀLĬA, a festival celebrated at Rome every year on the 11th of\r\nJune, in honour of the goddess Mater Matuta, whose temple stood in\r\nthe Forum Boarium. It was celebrated only by Roman matrons, and\r\nthe sacrifices offered to the goddess consisted of cakes baked in\r\npots of earthenware. Slaves were not allowed to take part in the\r\nsolemnities, or to enter the temple of the goddess. One slave,\r\nhowever, was admitted by the matrons, but only to be exposed to a\r\nhumiliating treatment, for one of the matrons gave her a blow on the\r\ncheek, and then sent her away from the temple. The matrons on this\r\noccasion took with them the children of their sisters, but not their\r\nown, held them in their arms, and prayed for their welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĀTRŌNĀLĬA, a festival celebrated on the Kalends of March in honour\r\nof Juno Lucina. Hence Horace says, “Martiis _caelebs_ quid agam\r\nKalendis.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMĀTRĬMŌNĬUM NUPTĬAE (γάμος), marriage. (1) GREEK. The ancient Greek\r\nlegislators considered the relation of marriage as a matter not\r\nmerely of private, but also of public or general interest. This\r\nwas particularly the case at Sparta, where proceedings might be\r\ntaken against those who married too late or unsuitably, as well as\r\nagainst those who did not marry at all. But independent of public\r\nconsiderations, there were also private or personal reasons, peculiar\r\nto the ancients, which made marriage an obligation. One of these was\r\nthe duty incumbent upon every individual to provide for a continuance\r\nof representatives to succeed himself as ministers of the Divinity;\r\nand another was the desire felt by almost every one, not merely to\r\nperpetuate his own name, but to leave some one who might make the\r\ncustomary offerings at his grave. We are told that with this view\r\nchildless persons sometimes adopted children. The choice of a wife\r\namong the ancients was but rarely grounded upon affection, and\r\nscarcely ever could have been the result of previous acquaintance\r\nor familiarity. In many cases a father chose for his son a bride\r\nwhom the latter had never seen, or compelled him to marry for the\r\nsake of checking his extravagances. By the Athenian laws a citizen\r\nwas not allowed to marry with a foreign woman, nor conversely,\r\nunder very severe penalties, but proximity by blood (ἀγχιστεία), or\r\nconsanguinity (συγγένεια), was not, with some few exceptions, a bar\r\nto marriage in any part of Greece; direct lineal descent was. At\r\nAthens the most important preliminary to marriage was the betrothal\r\n(ἐγγύησις), which was in fact indispensable to the complete validity\r\nof a marriage contract. It was made by the natural or legal guardian\r\n(ὁ κύριος) of the bride elect, and attended by the relatives of\r\nboth parties as witnesses. The wife’s dowry was settled at the\r\nbetrothal. On the day before the _gamos_, or marriage, or sometimes\r\non the day itself, certain sacrifices or offerings (προτέλεια γάμων\r\nor προγάμεια) were made to the gods who presided over marriage.\r\nAnother ceremony of almost general observance on the wedding day,\r\nwas the bathing of both the bride and bridegroom in water fetched\r\nfrom some particular fountain, whence, as some think, the custom\r\nof placing the figure of a λουτροφόρος or “water carrier” over the\r\ntombs of those who died unmarried. After these preliminaries, the\r\nbride was generally conducted from her father’s to the house of the\r\nbridegroom at nightfall, in a chariot (ἐφ’ ἁμάξης) drawn by a pair\r\nof males or oxen, and furnished with a kind of couch (κλινίς) as a\r\nseat. On either side of her sat the bridegroom and one of his most\r\nintimate friends or relations, who from his office was called the\r\n_paranymph_ (παράνυμφος or νυμφευτής); but as he rode in the carriage\r\n(ὄχημα) with the bride and bridegroom, he was sometimes called the\r\nπάροχος. The nuptial procession was probably accompanied, according\r\nto circumstances, by a number of persons, some of whom carried the\r\nnuptial torches. Both bride and bridegroom (the former veiled) were\r\ndecked out in their best attire, with chaplets on their heads,\r\nand the doors of their houses were hung with festoons of ivy and\r\nbay. As the bridal procession moved along, the hymenaean song was\r\nsung to the accompaniment of Lydian flutes, even in olden times,\r\nas beautifully described by Homer, and the married pair received\r\nthe greetings and congratulations of those who met them. After\r\nentering the bridegroom’s house, into which the bride was probably\r\nconducted by his mother, bearing a lighted torch, it was customary\r\nto shower sweetmeats upon them (καταχύσματα), as emblems of plenty\r\nand prosperity. After this came the nuptial feast, to which the\r\nname _gamos_ was particularly applied; it was generally given in\r\nthe house of the bridegroom or his parents; and besides being a\r\nfestive meeting, served other and more important purposes. There\r\nwas no public rite, whether civil or religious, connected with the\r\ncelebration of marriage amongst the ancient Greeks, and therefore no\r\npublic record of its solemnisation. This deficiency then was supplied\r\nby the marriage feast, for the guests were of course competent to\r\nprove the fact of a marriage having taken place. To this feast,\r\ncontrary to the usual practice amongst the Greeks, women were invited\r\nas well as men; but they seem to have sat at a separate table, with\r\nthe bride still veiled amongst them. At the conclusion of this feast\r\nshe was conducted by her husband into the bridal chamber; and a\r\nlaw of Solon required that on entering it they should eat a quince\r\ntogether, as if to indicate that their conversation ought to be\r\nsweet and agreeable. The song called the _Epithalamium_ was then sung\r\nbefore the doors of the bridal chamber. The day after the marriage,\r\nthe first of the bride’s residence in her new abode, was called\r\nthe _epaulia_ (ἐπαύλια); on which their friends sent the customary\r\npresents to the newly married couple. On another day, the _apaulia_\r\n(ἀπαύλια), perhaps the second after marriage, the bridegroom left\r\nhis house, to lodge apart from his wife at his father’s-in-law.\r\nSome of the presents made to the bride by her husband and friends\r\nwere called _anacalypteria_ (ἀνακαλυπτήρια), as being given on the\r\noccasion of the bride first appearing unveiled: they were probably\r\ngiven on the _epaulia_, or day after the marriage. Another ceremony\r\nobserved after marriage was the sacrifice which the husband offered\r\nup on the occasion of his bride being registered amongst his own\r\nphratores. The above account refers to Athenian customs.--At Sparta\r\nthe betrothal of the bride by her father or guardian (κύριος) was\r\nrequisite as a preliminary of marriage, as well as at Athens. Another\r\ncustom peculiar to the Spartans, and a relic of ancient times, was\r\nthe seizure of the bride by her intended husband, but of course with\r\nthe sanction of her parents or guardians. She was not, however,\r\nimmediately domiciled in her husband’s house, but cohabited with him\r\nfor some time clandestinely, till he brought her, and frequently\r\nher mother also, to his home.--The Greeks, generally speaking,\r\nentertained little regard for the female character. They considered\r\nwomen, in fact, as decidedly inferior to men, qualified to discharge\r\nonly the subordinate functions in life, and rather necessary as\r\nhelpmates than agreeable as companions. To these notions female\r\neducation for the most part corresponded, and in fact confirmed\r\nthem; it did not supply the elegant accomplishments and refinement\r\nof manners which permanently engage the affections, when other\r\nattractions have passed away. Aristotle states, that the relation of\r\nman to woman is that of the governor to the subject; and Plato, that\r\na woman’s virtue may be summed up in a few words, for she has only\r\nto manage the house well, keeping what there is in it, and obeying\r\nher husband. Among the Dorians, however, and especially at Sparta,\r\nwomen enjoyed much more estimation than in the rest of Greece.--(2)\r\nROMAN. A legal Roman marriage was called _justae nuptiae_, _justum\r\nmatrimonium_, as being conformable to _jus_ (_civile_) or to law. A\r\nlegal marriage was either _Cum conventione uxoris in manum viri_ or\r\nit was without this convention. But both forms of marriage agreed\r\nin this: there must be connubium between the parties, and consent.\r\nThe legal consequences as to the power of the father over his\r\nchildren were the same in both. _Connubium_ is merely a term which\r\ncomprehends all the conditions of a legal marriage. Generally it may\r\nbe stated, that there was only connubium between Roman citizens;\r\nthe cases in which it at any time existed between parties, not both\r\nRoman citizens, were exceptions to the general rule. Originally,\r\nor at least at one period of the republic, there was no connubium\r\nbetween the patricians and the plebeians; but this was altered by the\r\nLex Canuleia (B.C. 445.), which allowed connubium between persons\r\nof those two classes. There were various degrees of consanguinity\r\nand affinity, within which there was no connubium. An illegal union\r\nof a male and female, though affecting to be, was not a marriage:\r\nthe man had no legal wife, and the children had no legal father:\r\nconsequently they were not in the power of their reputed father. The\r\nmarriage _Cum conventione_ differed from that _Sine conventione_,\r\nin the relationship which it effected between the husband and the\r\nwife; the marriage _cum conventione_ was a necessary condition to\r\nmake a woman a _materfamilias_. By the marriage cum conventione,\r\nthe wife passed into the familia of her husband, and was to him\r\nin the relation of a daughter, or, as it was expressed, _in manum\r\nconvenit_. In the marriage sine conventione, the wife’s relation\r\nto her own familia remained as before, and she was merely _uxor_.\r\n“_Uxor_,” says Cicero, “is a genus of which there are two species;\r\none is _materfamilias, quae in manum convenit_; the other is _uxor_\r\nonly.” Accordingly, a materfamilias is a wife who is in manu, and\r\nin the familia of her husband. A wife not in manu was not a member\r\nof her husband’s familia, and therefore the term could not apply\r\nto her. _Matrona_ was properly a wife not in manu, and equivalent\r\nto uxor; and she was called matrona before she had any children.\r\nBut these words are not always used in these their original and\r\nproper meanings. It does not appear that any forms were requisite\r\nin the marriage sine conventione; and apparently the evidence of\r\nsuch marriage was cohabitation matrimonii causa. The matrimonii\r\ncausa might be proved by various kinds of evidence. In the case of\r\na marriage cum conventione, there were three forms, 1. _Usus_, 2.\r\n_Farreum_, and 3. _Coemptio_.--1. Marriage was effected by _usus_,\r\nif a woman lived with a man for a whole year as his wife; and this\r\nwas by analogy to usucaption of movables generally, in which usus\r\nfor one year gave ownership. The Law of the Twelve Tables provided,\r\nthat if a woman did not wish to come into the manus of her husband\r\nin this manner, she should absent herself from him annually for\r\nthree nights (_trinoctium_) and so break the usus of the year.\r\n2. _Farreum_ was a form of marriage, in which certain words were\r\nused in the presence of ten witnesses, and were accompanied by a\r\ncertain religious ceremony, in which panis farreus was employed;\r\nand hence this form of marriage was also called _confarreatio_.\r\nIt appears that certain priestly offices, such as that of Flamen\r\nDialis, could only be held by those who were born of parents who\r\nhad been married by this ceremony (_confarreati parentes_). 3.\r\n_Coemptio_ was effected by mancipatio, and consequently the wife was\r\nin mancipio. [MANCIPIUM.] A woman who was cohabiting with a man as\r\nuxor, might come into his manus by this ceremony, in which case the\r\ncoemptio was said to be matrimonii causa, and she who was formerly\r\nuxor became _apud maritum filiae loco_. _Sponsalia_ were not an\r\nunusual preliminary of marriage, but they were not necessary.--The\r\nsponsalia were an agreement to marry, made in such form as to give\r\neach party a right of action in case of non-performance, and the\r\noffending party was condemned in such damages as to the judex seemed\r\njust. The woman who was promised in marriage was accordingly called\r\n_sponsa_, which is equivalent to promissa; the man who was engaged\r\nto marry was called _sponsus_.--The sponsalia were of course not\r\nbinding, if the parties consented to waive the contract. Sometimes\r\na present was made by the future husband to the future wife by way\r\nof earnest (_arrha_, _arrha sponsalitia_), or, as it was called,\r\n_propter nuptias donatio_.--The consequences of marriage were--1.\r\nThe power of the father over the children of the marriage, which was\r\na completely new relation, an effect indeed of marriage, but one\r\nwhich had no influence over the relation of the husband and wife.\r\n[PATRIA POTESTAS.] 2. The liabilities of either of the parties to\r\nthe punishments affixed to the violation of the marriage union.\r\n[ADULTERIUM; DIVORTIUM.] 3. The relation of husband and wife with\r\nrespect to property. [DOS.] When marriage was dissolved, the parties\r\nto it might marry again; but opinion considered it more decent for a\r\nwoman not to marry again. A woman was required by usage (_mos_) to\r\nwait a year before she contracted a second marriage, on the pain of\r\ninfamia.--It remains to describe the customs and rites which were\r\nobserved by the Romans at marriages. After the parties had agreed to\r\nmarry and the persons in whose potestas they were had consented, a\r\nmeeting of friends was sometimes held at the house of the maiden for\r\nthe purpose of settling the marriage-contract, which was written on\r\ntablets, and signed by both parties. The woman after she had promised\r\nto become the wife of a man was called _sponsa_, _pacta_, _dicta_,\r\nor _sperata_. It appears that, at least during the imperial period,\r\nthe man put a ring on the finger of his betrothed, as a pledge of\r\nhis fidelity. This ring was probably, like all rings at this time,\r\nworn on the left hand, and on the finger nearest to the smallest.\r\nThe last point to be fixed was the day on which the marriage was to\r\ntake place. The Romans believed that certain days were unfortunate\r\nfor the performance of the marriage rites, either on account of\r\nthe religious character of those days themselves, or on account of\r\nthe days by which they were followed, as the woman had to perform\r\ncertain religious rites on the day after her wedding, which could\r\nnot take place on a dies ater. Days not suitable for entering upon\r\nmatrimony were the calends, nones, and ides of every month, all dies\r\natri, the whole months of May and February, and a great number of\r\nfestivals. On the wedding-day, which in the early times was never\r\nfixed upon without consulting the auspices, the bride was dressed\r\nin a long white robe with a purple fringe, or adorned with ribands.\r\nThis dress was called _tunica recta_, and was bound round the waist\r\nwith a girdle (_corona_, _cingulum_, or _zona_), which the husband\r\nhad to untie in the evening. The bridal veil, called _flammeum_,\r\nwas of a bright yellow colour, and her shoes likewise. Her hair was\r\ndivided on this occasion with the point of a spear. The bride was\r\nconducted to the house of her husband in the evening. She was taken\r\nwith apparent violence from the arms of her mother, or of the person\r\nwho had to give her away. On her way she was accompanied by three\r\nboys dressed in the praetexta, and whose fathers and mothers were\r\nstill alive (_patrimi et matrimi_). One of them carried before her\r\na torch of white thorn (_spina_), or, according to others, of pine\r\nwood; the two others walked by her side, supporting her by the arm.\r\nThe bride herself carried a distaff and a spindle, with wool. A boy\r\ncalled _camillus_ carried in a covered vase (_cumera_, _cumerum_, or\r\n_camillum_), the so-called utensils of the bride and playthings for\r\nchildren (_crepundia_). Besides these persons who officiated on the\r\noccasion, the procession was attended by a numerous train of friends,\r\nboth of the bride and the bridegroom. When the procession arrived\r\nat the house of the bridegroom, the door of which was adorned with\r\ngarlands and flowers, the bride was carried across the threshold by\r\n_pronubi_, _i.e._ men who had been married to only one woman, that\r\nshe might not knock against it with her foot, which would have been\r\nan evil omen. Before she entered the house, she wound wool around the\r\ndoor-posts of her new residence, and anointed them with lard (_adeps\r\nsuillus_) or wolf’s fat (_adeps lupinus_). The husband received her\r\nwith fire and water, which the woman had to touch. This was either a\r\nsymbolic purification, or a symbolic expression of welcome, as the\r\ninterdicere aqua et igni was the formula for banishment. The bride\r\nsaluted her husband with the words: _ubi tu Caius, ego Caia_. After\r\nshe had entered the house with distaff and spindle, she was placed\r\nupon a sheep-skin, and here the keys of the house were delivered\r\ninto her hands. A repast (_coena nuptialis_) given by the husband\r\nto the whole train of relatives and friends who accompanied the\r\nbride, generally concluded the solemnity of the day. Many ancient\r\nwriters mention a very popular song, _Talasius_ or _Talassio_, which\r\nwas sung at weddings; but whether it was sung during the repast or\r\nduring the procession is not quite clear, though we may infer from\r\nthe story respecting the origin of the song, that it was sung while\r\nthe procession was advancing towards the house of the husband. It may\r\neasily be imagined that a solemnity like that of marriage did not\r\ntake place among the merry and humorous Italians without a variety\r\nof jests and railleries, and the ancient writers mention songs which\r\nwere sung before the door of the bridal apartment by girls, after\r\nthe company had left. These songs were probably the old Fescennina\r\n[FESCENNINA], and are frequently called _Epithalamia_. At the end of\r\nthe repast the bride was conducted by matrons who had not had more\r\nthan one husband (_pronubae_), to the lectus genialis in the atrium,\r\nwhich was on this occasion magnificently adorned and strewed with\r\nflowers. On the following day the husband sometimes gave another\r\nentertainment to his friends, which was called _repotia_, and the\r\nwoman, who on this day undertook the management of the house of her\r\nhusband, had to perform certain religious rites; on which account,\r\nas was observed above, it was necessary to select a day for the\r\nmarriage which was not followed by a dies ater. These rites probably\r\nconsisted of sacrifices to the Dii Penates. The position of a Roman\r\nwoman after marriage was very different from that of a Greek woman.\r\nThe Roman presided over the whole household; she educated her\r\nchildren, watched over and preserved the honour of the house, and as\r\nthe materfamilias she shared the honours and respect shown to her\r\nhusband. Far from being confined like the Greek women to a distinct\r\napartment, the Roman matron, at least during the better centuries\r\nof the republic, occupied the most important part of the house, the\r\natrium.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUSŌLĒUM Μαυσωλεῖον, signified originally _the sepulchre of\r\nMausolus_, which was a magnificent monument erected at Halicarnassus\r\nB.C. 353, by Artemisia, the widow of Mausolus. (See _Classical\r\nDict., art. Artemisia_.) It was adorned with beautiful works of\r\nart, and was regarded as one of the seven wonders of the world.\r\nThe word _Mausoleum_ was used by the Romans as a generic name for\r\nany magnificent sepulchral edifice. Mausolus, the dynast of Caria,\r\nhaving died in B.C. 353, his queen Artemisia evinced her sorrow\r\nby observing his funeral rites with the most expensive splendour,\r\nand by commencing the erection of a sepulchral monument to him at\r\nHalicarnassus, which should surpass any thing the world had yet seen.\r\nThe building extended 63 feet from north to south, being shorter on\r\nthe fronts, and its whole circuit was 411 feet (or, according to the\r\nBamberg MS., 440); it rose to the height of 25 cubits (37½ feet);\r\nand was surrounded by 36 columns. This part of the building was\r\ncalled _Pteron_. It was adorned with sculptures in relief, on its\r\neastern face by Scopas, on the northern by Bryaxis, on the southern\r\nby Timotheus, on the western by Leochares. Above this _pteron_ was\r\na pyramid equal to it in height, diminishing by 24 steps to its\r\nsummit, which was surmounted by the marble quadriga made by Pythis.\r\nThe total height, including this ornament, was 140 feet. In the Roman\r\n_Mausolea_ the form chiefly employed was that of a succession of\r\nterraces in imitation of the _rogus_. Of these the most celebrated\r\nwere those of Augustus and of Hadrian; the latter of which, stripped\r\nof its ornaments, still forms the fortress of modern Rome (the castle\r\nof S. Angelo); but of the other, which was on a still larger scale,\r\nand which was considered as one of the most magnificent buildings of\r\nAugustus, there are only some insignificant ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔDĬASTĪNI, the name given to slaves, used for any common purpose.\r\nThe name is chiefly given to certain slaves belonging to the familia\r\nrustica, but it is also applied sometimes to slaves in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔDIMNUS μέδιμνος, the principal dry measure of the Greeks. It was\r\nused especially for measuring corn. The Attic medimnus was equal\r\nto six Roman modii. For its subdivisions see Tables at the end.\r\n[METRETES; CHOENIX; XESTES; COTYLA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĒDIX TUTICUS, the name of the supreme magistrate among the Oscan\r\npeople. _Medix_ appears to have signified a magistrate of any kind,\r\nand _tuticus_ to have been equivalent to _magnus_ or _summus_. Livy,\r\ntherefore, in calling the medix tuticus the _summus magistratus_,\r\ngives a literal translation of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔGĂLĒSĬA, MĔGĂLENSĬA, or MĔGĂLENSES LŪDI, a festival with games,\r\ncelebrated at Rome in the month of April and in honour of the great\r\nmother of the gods (Cybelé, μεγάλη θεός, whence the festival derived\r\nits name). The statue of the goddess was brought to Rome from\r\nPessinus in B.C. 203, and the day of its arrival was solemnised with\r\na magnificent procession, lectisternia, and games, and great numbers\r\nof people carried presents to the goddess on the Capitol. The regular\r\ncelebration of the Megalesia, however, did not begin till twelve\r\nyears later (B.C. 191), when the temple, which had been vowed and\r\nordered to be built in B.C. 203, was completed and dedicated by M.\r\nJunius Brutus. The festival lasted for six days, beginning on the 4th\r\nof April. The season of this festival, like that of the whole month\r\nin which it took place, was full of general rejoicings and feasting.\r\nIt was customary for the wealthy Romans on this occasion to invite\r\none another mutually to their repasts. The games which were held at\r\nthe Megalesia were purely scenic, and not circenses. They were at\r\nfirst held on the Palatine, in front of the temple of the goddess,\r\nbut afterwards also in the theatres. The day which was especially\r\nset apart for the performance of scenic plays was the third of the\r\nfestival. Slaves were not permitted to be present at the games, and\r\nthe magistrates appeared dressed in a purple toga and praetexta,\r\nwhence the proverb, _purpura Megalensis_. The games were under the\r\nsuperintendence of the curule aediles, and we know that four of the\r\nextant plays of Terence were performed at the Megalesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBRĀNA. [LIBER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMENSA (τράπεζα), a table. The simplest kind of table was a round\r\none with three legs, called in Greek τρίπους. Tables, however, must\r\nusually have had four legs, as the etymology of τράπεζα, the common\r\nword for table, indicates. For the houses of the opulent, tables were\r\nmade of the most valuable and beautiful kinds of wood, especially of\r\nmaple, or of the citrus of Africa, which was a species of cypress\r\nor juniper. As the table was not large, it was usual to place the\r\ndishes and the various kinds of meat upon it, and then to bring it\r\nthus furnished to the place where the guests were reclining. On many\r\noccasions, indeed, each guest either had a small table to himself,\r\nor the company was divided into parties of two or three, with a\r\nseparate table for each party, as is distinctly represented in the\r\ncut under SYMPOSIUM. Hence we have such phrases as _mensam apponere_\r\nor _opponere_, and _mensam auferre_ or _removere_. The two principal\r\ncourses of a _deipnon_ and _coena_, or a Greek and Roman dinner,\r\nwere called respectively πρώτη τράπεζα, δεύτερα τράπεζα, and _mensa\r\nprima_, _mensa secunda_. [COENA; DEIPNON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMENSĀRĬI, MENSŬLĀRĬI, or NŪMŬLĀRĬI, a kind of public bankers at\r\nRome who were appointed by the state; they were distinct from the\r\nargentarii, who were common bankers, and did business on their\r\nown account. [ARGENTARII.] The mensarii had their tables or banks\r\n(_mensae_) like ordinary bankers, in the forum, and in the name of\r\nthe aerarium they offered ready money to debtors who could give\r\nsecurity to the state for it. Such an expediency was devised by the\r\nstate only in times of great distress. The first time that mensarii\r\n(_quinqueviri mensarii_) were appointed was in B.C. 352, at the time\r\nwhen the plebeians were so deeply involved in debt, that they were\r\nobliged to borrow money from new creditors in order to pay the old\r\nones, and thus ruined themselves completely. On this occasion they\r\nwere also authorised to ordain that cattle or land should be received\r\nas payment at a fair valuation. With the exception of this first\r\ntime, they appear during the time of the republic to have always\r\nbeen _triumviri mensarii_. One class of mensarii, however (perhaps\r\nan inferior order), the _mensularii_ or _numularii_, seem to have\r\nbeen permanently employed by the state, and these must be meant when\r\nwe read, that not only the aerarium, but also private individuals,\r\ndeposited in their hands sums of money which they had to dispose of.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENSIS. [CALENDARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔRENDA. [COENA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔTAE. [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔTALLUM (μέταλλον), a _mine_ and _metal_. The metals which have been\r\nknown from the earliest period of which we have any information are\r\nthose which were long distinguished as the seven principal metals,\r\nnamely, gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, lead, and mercury. If to\r\nthis list we add the compound of gold and silver called _electrum_,\r\nthe compound of copper and tin called χαλκός and _aes_ (bronze), and\r\nsteel, we have, in all probability, a complete list of the metals\r\nknown to the Greeks and Romans, with the exception of zinc, which\r\nthey do not seem to have known as a metal, but only in its ores, and\r\nof brass, which, they regarded as a sort of bronze. The early Greeks\r\nwere no doubt chiefly indebted for a supply of the various metals to\r\nthe commerce of the Phoenicians, who procured them principally from\r\nArabia and Spain, and tin from our own island and the East. They were\r\nperfectly acquainted with the processes of smelting the metal from\r\nthe ore, and of forging heated masses into the required shapes, by\r\nthe aid of the hammer and tongs. The smith’s instruments were the\r\nanvil (ἄκμων) with the block on which it rested (ἀκμόθετον), the\r\ntongs (πυράγρη) and the hammer (ῥαιστήρ, σφῦρα). The advances made in\r\nthe art of metallurgy in subsequent times are chiefly connected with\r\nthe improvements in the art of statuary. The method of working, as\r\ndescribed in Homer, seems to have long prevailed, namely by beating\r\nout lumps of the material into the form proposed, and afterwards\r\nfitting the pieces together by means of pins or keys. It was called\r\nσφυρήλατον, from σφῦρα, a hammer. The next mode, among the Greeks, of\r\nexecuting metal works seems to have been by plating upon a nucleus,\r\nor general form, of wood--a practice which was employed also by the\r\nEgyptians. It is extremely difficult to determine at what date the\r\ncasting of metal was introduced. According to the statements of\r\nPausanias and Pliny, the art of casting in bronze and in iron was\r\ninvented by Rhoecus and Theodorus of Samos, who probably lived in the\r\nsixth and fifth centuries before our era.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔTOICI (μέτοικοι), the name by which, at Athens and in other\r\nGreek states, the _resident aliens_ were designated. They must be\r\ndistinguished from such strangers as made only a transitory stay\r\nin a place, for it was a characteristic of a _metoicus_, that he\r\nresided permanently in the city. No city of Greece perhaps had\r\nsuch a number of resident aliens as Athens, since none afforded to\r\nstrangers so many facilities for carrying on mercantile business,\r\nor a more agreeable mode of living. In the census instituted by\r\nDemetrius Phalereus (B.C. 309), the number of resident aliens at\r\nAthens was 10,000, in which number women and children were probably\r\nnot included. The jealousy with which the citizens of the ancient\r\nGreek republics kept their body clear of intruders, is also manifest\r\nin their regulations concerning aliens. However long they might\r\nhave resided in Athens, they were always regarded as strangers,\r\nwhence they are sometimes called ξένοι, and to remind them of their\r\nposition, they had on some occasions to perform certain degrading\r\nservices for the Athenian citizens [HYDRIAPHORIA]. These services\r\nwere, however, in all probability not intended to hurt the feelings\r\nof the aliens, but were simply acts symbolical of their relation to\r\nthe citizens. Aliens were not allowed to acquire landed property in\r\nthe state they had chosen for their residence, and were consequently\r\nobliged to live in hired houses or apartments. As they did not\r\nconstitute a part of the state, and were yet in constant intercourse\r\nand commerce with its members, every alien was obliged to select a\r\ncitizen for his patron (προστάτης), who was not only the mediator\r\nbetween them and the state, through whom alone they could transact\r\nany legal business, whether private or public, but was at the same\r\ntime answerable (ἐγγυητής) to the state for the conduct of his\r\nclient. On the other hand, however, the state allowed the aliens to\r\ncarry on all kinds of industry and commerce under the protection of\r\nthe law; in fact, at Athens nearly all business was in the hands\r\nof aliens, who on this account lived for the most part in the\r\nPeiraeeus. Each family of aliens, whether they availed themselves of\r\nthe privilege of carrying on any mercantile business or not, had to\r\npay an annual tax (μετοίκιον or ξενικά) of twelve drachmae, or if\r\nthe head of the family was a widow, of only six drachmae. If aliens\r\ndid not pay this tax, or if they assumed the right of citizens,\r\nand probably also in case they refused to select a patron, they\r\nnot only forfeited the protection of the state, but were sold as\r\nslaves. Extraordinary taxes and liturgies (εἰσφοραί and λειτουργίαι)\r\ndevolved upon aliens no less than upon citizens. The aliens were also\r\nobliged, like citizens, to serve in the regular armies and in the\r\nfleet, both abroad and at home, for the defence of the city. Those\r\naliens who were exempt from the burthens peculiar to their class were\r\ncalled _isoteles_ (ἰσοτελεῖς). They had not to pay the μετοίκιον\r\n(ἀτέλια μετοικίου), were not obliged to choose a προστάτης, and in\r\nfact enjoyed all the rights of citizens, except those of a political\r\nnature. Their condition was termed ἰσοτέλεια and ἰσοπολιτεία.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔTOPA or MĔTŎPE (μετόπη), the name applied to each of the spaces\r\nbetween the triglyphs in the frieze of the Doric order, and by\r\nmetonymy to the sculptured ornament with which those spaces were\r\nfilled up. In the original significance of the parts the triglyphs\r\nrepresent the ends of the cross-beams or joists which rested on the\r\narchitrave; the beds of these beams were called ὀπαί, and hence the\r\nspaces between them μετόπαι. Originally they were left open; next\r\nthey were filled up with plain slabs, as in the propylaea at Eleusis,\r\nand many other buildings, and lastly, but still at an early period,\r\nthey were adorned with sculptures either in low or high relief. The\r\nmetopes from the Parthenon in the British Museum are adorned with\r\nsculptures in high relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĔTRĒTES (μετρητής), the principal Greek liquid measure. The Attic\r\nmetretes was equal in capacity to the amphora, containing 8 galls.\r\n7·365 pints, English. See the Tables. [CHOUS; CHOENIX; XESTES;\r\nCOTYLA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĒTRŎPŎLIS. [COLONIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMĬLIĀRE, MILLĬĀRĬUM, or MILLE PASSUUM (μίλιον), the Roman mile,\r\nconsisted of 1000 paces (_passus_) of 5 feet each, and was therefore\r\n= 5000 feet. Taking the Roman foot at 11·6496 English inches [PES],\r\nthe Roman mile would be 1618 English yards, or 142 yards less than\r\nthe English statute mile. The most common term for the mile is\r\n_mille passuum_, or only the initials M. P.; sometimes the word\r\n_passuum_ is omitted. The Roman mile contained 8 Greek stadia. The\r\nmile-stones along the Roman roads were called _milliaria_. They were\r\nalso called _lapides_; thus we have _ad tertium lapidem_ (or without\r\nthe word _lapidem_) for 3 miles from Rome. Augustus erected a gilt\r\npillar in the Forum, where the principal roads terminated, which was\r\ncalled _milliarium aureum_; but the miles were not reckoned from\r\nit, but from the gates of the city. Such central marks appear to\r\nhave been common in the principal cities of the Roman empire. The\r\n“London-stone” in Cannon-street is supposed to have marked the centre\r\nof the Roman roads in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĪMUS (μῖμος), the name by which, in Greece and at Rome, a species\r\nof the drama was designated, though the Roman mimus differed\r\nessentially from the Greek. The Greek mimus seems to have originated\r\namong the Greeks of Sicily and southern Italy, and to have consisted\r\noriginally of extemporary representations or imitations of ridiculous\r\noccurrences of common life at certain festivals. At a later period\r\nthese rude representations acquired a more artistic form, which was\r\nbrought to a high degree of perfection by Sophron of Syracuse (about\r\nB.C. 420). He wrote his pieces in the popular dialect of the Dorians\r\nand a kind of rhythmical prose. Among the Romans the word mimus was\r\napplied to a species of dramatic plays as well as to the persons who\r\nacted in them. It is certain that the Romans did not derive their\r\nmimus from the Greeks in southern Italy, but that it was of native\r\ngrowth. The Greek mimes were written in prose, and the name μῖμος\r\nwas never applied to an actor, but if used of a person it signified\r\none who made grimaces. The Roman mimes were imitations of foolish\r\nand mostly indecent occurrences, and scarcely differed from comedy\r\nexcept in consisting more of gestures and mimicry than of spoken\r\ndialogue. At Rome such mimes seem originally to have been exhibited\r\nat funerals, where one or more persons (_mimi_) represented in a\r\nburlesque manner the life of the deceased. If there were several\r\nmimi, one of them, or their leader, was called _archimimus_. These\r\ncoarse and indecent performances had greater charms for the Romans\r\nthan the regular drama. They were performed on the stage as farces\r\nafter tragedies, and during the empire they gradually supplanted the\r\nplace of the Atellanae. It was peculiar to the actors in these mimes,\r\nto wear neither masks, the cothurnus, nor the soccus, whence they are\r\nsometimes called planipedes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMĬNA. [TALENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRMILLŌNES. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSĬO. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSĬO. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMITRA (μίτρα), in general a band of any kind, and specifically, (1) A\r\nbelt or girdle worn by warriors round the waist. [ZONA.]--(2) A broad\r\nband of cloth worn round the head, to which the name of _anadema_ was\r\nsometimes given. [COMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMODĬUS, the principal dry measure of the Romans, was equal to\r\none-third of the amphora, and therefore contained nearly two gallons\r\nEnglish. (See the Tables.) The modius was one-sixth of the medimnus.\r\n\r\n\r\nMŎLA (μύλος), a mill. All mills were anciently made of stone, the\r\nkind used being a volcanic trachyte or porous lava (_pyrites_,\r\n_silices_, _pumiceas_). Every mill consisted of two essential parts,\r\nthe upper mill-stone, which was moveable (_catillus_, ὄνος, τὸ\r\nἐπιμύλιον), and the lower, which was fixed and by much the larger of\r\nthe two. Hence a mill is sometimes called _molae_ in the plural. The\r\nprincipal mills mentioned by ancient authors are the following:--I.\r\nThe hand-mill, or quern, called _mola manuaria, versatilis_, or\r\n_trusatilis_. The hand-mills were worked among the Greeks and Romans\r\nby slaves. Their pistrinum was consequently proverbial as a place of\r\npainful and degrading labour; and this toil was imposed principally\r\non women. II. The cattle-mill, _mola asinaria_, in which human labour\r\nwas supplied by the use of an ass or some other animal. III. The\r\nwater-mill (_mola aquaria_, ὑδραλέτης). A cogged wheel, attached to\r\nthe axis of the water wheel, turned another which was attached to the\r\naxis of the upper mill-stone: the corn to be ground fell between the\r\nstones out of a hopper (_infundibulum_), which was fixed above them.\r\nIV. The floating-mill. V. The saw-mill. VI. The pepper-mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMŎNARCHĬA (μοναρχία), a general name for any form of government\r\nin which the supreme functions of political administration are in\r\nthe hands of a single person. The term μοναρχία is applied to such\r\ngovernments, whether they are hereditary or elective, legal or\r\nusurped. In its commonest application, it is equivalent to βασιλεία,\r\nwhether absolute or limited. But the rule of an _aesymnetes_ or a\r\n_tyrant_ would equally be called a μοναρχία. Hence Plutarch uses it\r\nto express the Latin _dictatura_. It is by a somewhat rhetorical use\r\nof the word that it is applied now and then to the δῆμος.\r\n\r\n\r\nMŎNĒTA, the mint, or the place where money was coined. The mint of\r\nRome was a building on the Capitoline, and attached to the temple\r\nof Juno Moneta, as the aerarium was to the temple of Saturn. The\r\nofficers who had the superintendence of the mint were the _Triumviri\r\nMonetales_, who were perhaps first appointed about B.C. 269. Under\r\nthe republic, the coining of money was not a privilege which belonged\r\nexclusively to the state. The coins struck in the time of the\r\nrepublic mostly bear the names of private individuals; and it would\r\nseem that every Roman citizen had the right of having his own gold\r\nand silver coined in the public mint, and under the superintendence\r\nof its officers. Still no one till the time of the empire had the\r\nright of putting his own image upon a coin; Julius Caesar was the\r\nfirst to whom this privilege was granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nMŎNĪLE (ὅρμος), a necklace. Necklaces were worn by both sexes\r\namong the most polished of those nations which the Greeks called\r\nbarbarous, especially the Indians, the Egyptians, and the Persians.\r\nGreek and Roman females adopted them more particularly as a bridal\r\nornament. They were of various forms, as may be seen by the following\r\nspecimens:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monilia, necklaces. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nMŎNŬMENTUM. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMŎRA. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMORTĀRIUM, also called PĪLA and PILUM (ὄλμος, ἴγδη, ἴγδις), a mortar.\r\nBefore the invention of mills [MOLA] corn was pounded and rubbed in\r\nmortars (_pistum_), and hence the place for making bread, or the\r\nbake-house, was called _pistrinum_. Also long after the introduction\r\nof mills this was an indispensable article of domestic furniture.\r\nThose used in pharmacy were sometimes made of Egyptian alabaster.\r\nThe mortar was also employed in pounding charcoal, rubbing it with\r\nglue, in order to make black paint (_atramentum_), in making plaster\r\nfor the walls of apartments, in mixing spices and fragrant herbs\r\nand flowers for the use of the kitchen, and in metallurgy, as in\r\ntriturating cinnabar to obtain mercury from it by sublimation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULSUM. [VINUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMŪNĔRĀTOR. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMŪNĬCEPS, MŪNĬCĬPĬUM. [COLONIA; FOEDERATAE CIVITATES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMŪNUS. [HONORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMŪNUS. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMŪRĀLIS CŎRŌNA. [CORONA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMURRHĬNA VĀSA, or MURRĔA VĀSA, were first introduced into Rome by\r\nPompey, who dedicated cups of this kind to Jupiter Capitolinus. Their\r\nvalue was very great. Nero gave 300 talents for a capis or drinking\r\ncup. These murrhine vessels came from the East, principally from\r\nplaces within the Parthian empire, and chiefly from Caramania. They\r\nwere made of a substance formed by a moisture thickened in the earth\r\nby heat, and were chiefly valued on account of the variety of their\r\ncolours. Modern writers differ much respecting the material of which\r\nthey were composed, and some think they may have been true Chinese\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\n\r\nMŪRUS, MOENĬA (τεῖχος), the wall of a city, in contradistinction to\r\nPARIES (τοῖχος), the wall of a house, and _Maceria_, a boundary wall.\r\nWe find cities surrounded by massive walls at the earliest periods\r\nof Greek and Roman history. Homer speaks of the chief cities of the\r\nArgive kingdom as “the walled Tiryns,” and “Mycenae the well-built\r\ncity,” attesting the great antiquity of those identical gigantic\r\nwalls which still stand at Tiryns and Mycenae, and which have been\r\nfrequently attributed to the Cyclopes and Pelasgians. Three principal\r\nspecies can be clearly distinguished:--1. That in which the masses of\r\nstone are of irregular shape and are put together without any attempt\r\nto fit them into one another, the interstices being loosely filled in\r\nwith smaller stones. An example is given in the annexed engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Wall at Tiryns.]\r\n\r\n2. In other cases we find the blocks still of irregular polygonal\r\nshapes, but their sides are sufficiently smoothed to make each fit\r\naccurately into the angles between the others, and their faces are\r\ncut so as to give the whole wall a tolerably smooth surface. An\r\nexample is given in the annexed engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Wall of Larissa, the Acropolis of Argos.]\r\n\r\n3. In the third species, the blocks are laid in horizontal courses,\r\nmore or less regular (sometimes indeed so irregular, that none of\r\nthe horizontal joints are continuous), and with vertical joints\r\neither perpendicular or oblique, and with all the joints more or less\r\naccurately fitted. The walls of Mycenae present one of the ruder\r\nexamples of this sort of structure; and the following engraving\r\nof the “Lion Gate” of that fortress (so called from the rudely\r\nsculptured figures of lions) shows also the manner in which the gates\r\nof these three species of walls were built, by supporting an immense\r\nblock of stone, for the lintel, upon two others, for jambs, the\r\nlatter inclining inwards, so as to give more space than if they were\r\nupright.--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Wall at Mycenae.]\r\n\r\nThe materials employed in walls about the time of Pericles were\r\nvarious sorts of stone, and, in some of the most magnificent temples,\r\nmarble. The practice of putting a facing of marble over a wall of a\r\ncommoner material was introduced in the next period of architectural\r\nhistory. For buildings of a common sort, the materials employed were\r\nsmaller stones, rough or squared, or flints, as well as bricks. These\r\nwere bound together with various kinds of mortar or cement, composed\r\nof lime mixed with different sands and volcanic earths. The history\r\nof Roman masonry is not very different from that of the Greek.--The\r\nmost ancient works at Rome, such as the _Carcer Mamertinus_, the\r\n_Cloaca Maxima_, and the Servian Walls, were constructed of massive\r\nquadrangular hewn stones, placed together without cement. [CLOACA.]\r\nFive species of Roman masonry may be distinguished; namely, 1. when\r\nthe blocks of stone are laid in alternate courses, lengthwise in one\r\ncourse, and crosswise in the next; this is the most common; 2. when\r\nthe stones in each course are laid alternately along and across; this\r\nconstruction was usual when the walls were to be faced with slabs\r\nof marble; 3. when they are laid entirely lengthwise; 4. entirely\r\ncrosswise; and 5. when the courses are alternately higher and lower\r\nthan each other. As by the Greeks, so by the Romans, walls of a\r\ncommoner sort were built of smaller quarried stones (_caementa_) or\r\nof bricks. The excellence of the cement which the Romans used enabled\r\nthem to construct walls of very small rough stones, not laid in\r\ncourses, but held together by the mortar; this structure was called\r\n_opus incertum_. Another structure of which the Romans made great\r\nuse, and which was one of the most durable of all, was that composed\r\nof courses of flat tiles. Such courses were also introduced in the\r\nother kinds of stone and brick walls, in which they both served as\r\nbond-courses, and, in the lower part of the wall, kept the damp\r\nfrom rising from the ground. Brick walls covered with stucco were\r\nexceedingly common with the Romans: even columns were made of brick\r\ncovered with stucco.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCŬLUS was a kind of vinea, one of the smaller military machines,\r\nby which the besiegers of a town were protected.\r\n\r\n\r\nMŪSĒUM (μουσεῖον), the name of an institution founded by Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, about B.C. 280, for the promotion of learning and the\r\nsupport of learned men. The museum formed part of the palace, and\r\ncontained cloisters or porticoes (περίπατος), a public theatre or\r\nlecture-room (ἐξέδρα), and a large hall (οἶκος μέγας), where the\r\nlearned men dined together. The museum was supported by a common\r\nfund, supplied apparently from the public treasury; and the whole\r\ninstitution was under the superintendence of a priest, who was\r\nappointed by the king, and after Egypt became a province of the Roman\r\nempire, by the Caesar. Botanical and zoological gardens appear to\r\nhave been attached to the museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nMȲRĬI (μυρίοι), the name given to the popular assembly of the\r\nArcadians, which was established after the overthrow of the Spartan\r\nsupremacy by the battle of Leuctra, and which used to meet at\r\nMegalopolis in order to determine upon matters affecting the whole\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSĬA (μύσια), a festival celebrated by the inhabitants of Pellene in\r\nAchaia in honour of Demeter Mysia, which lasted for 7 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSTĒRĬA. The names by which mysteries or mystic festivals were\r\ndesignated in Greece, are μυστήρια, τελεταί, and ὄργια. The name\r\nὄργια (from ἔοργα) originally signified only sacrifices accompanied\r\nby certain ceremonies, but it was afterwards applied especially\r\nto the ceremonies observed in the worship of Dionysus, and at a\r\nstill later period to mysteries in general. Τελετή signifies, in\r\ngeneral, a religious festival, but more particularly a lustration or\r\nceremony performed in order to avert some calamity, either public\r\nor private. Μυστήριον signifies, properly speaking, the secret part\r\nof the worship, but was also used in the same sense as τελετή, and\r\nfor mystic worship in general. Mysteries in general may be defined\r\nas sacrifices and ceremonies which took place at night or in secret\r\nwithin some sanctuary, which the uninitiated were not allowed\r\nto enter. What was essential to them, were objects of worship,\r\nsacred utensils, and traditions with their interpretation, which\r\nwere withheld from all persons not initiated. The most celebrated\r\nmysteries in Greece were those of Samothrace and Eleusis, which are\r\ndescribed in separate articles. [CABEIRIA; ELEUSINIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAENĬA. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNĂTĀTĬO, NĂTĀTŌRĬUM. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNĀVĀLIA, docks at Rome where ships were built, laid up, and refitted.\r\nThey were attached to the emporium outside of the Porta Trigemina,\r\nand were connected with the Tiber. The emporium and navalia were\r\nfirst included within the walls of the city by Aurelian.--The docks\r\n(νεώσοικοι or νεώρια) in the Peiraeeus at Athens cost 1000 talents,\r\nand having been destroyed in the anarchy were again restored and\r\nfinally completed by Lycurgus, the contemporary of Demosthenes. They\r\nwere under the superintendence of regular officers, called ἐπιμεληταὶ\r\nτῶν νεωρίων.\r\n\r\n\r\nNĀVĀLIS CŎRŌNA. [CORONA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNĀVARCHUS (ναύαρχος), the name by which the Greeks designated both\r\nthe captain of a single ship, and the admiral of a fleet. The office\r\nitself was called ναυαρχία. The admiral of the Athenian fleet was\r\nalways one of the ten generals (στρατηγοί) elected every year, and\r\nhe had either the whole or the chief command of the fleet. The\r\nchief officers who served under him were the trierarchs and the\r\npentecontarchs, each of whom commanded one vessel; the inferior\r\nofficers in the vessels were the κυβερνῆται or helmsmen, the\r\nκελευσταί or commanders of the rowers, and the πρωρᾶται, who must\r\nhave been employed at the prow of the vessels. Other Greek states\r\nwho kept a navy had likewise their navarchs. The chief admiral of\r\nthe Spartan fleet was called navarchus, and the second in command\r\n_epistoleus_ (ἐπιστολεύς). The same person was not allowed to hold\r\nthe office of navarchus two successive years at Sparta. [EPISTOLEUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUCRĀRĬA (ναυκραρία), the name of a division of the inhabitants\r\nof Attica. The four ancient phylae were each divided into three\r\nphratries, and each of these twelve phratries into four naucraries,\r\nof which there were thus forty-eight. What the naucraries were\r\nprevious to the legislation of Solon is not stated anywhere, but it\r\nis not improbable that they were political divisions similar to the\r\ndemes in the constitution of Cleisthenes, and were made perhaps at\r\nthe time of the institution of the nine archons, for the purpose of\r\nregulating the liturgies, taxes, or financial and military affairs\r\nin general. At any rate, however, the naucraries before the time of\r\nSolon can have had no connection with the navy, for the Athenians\r\nthen had no navy; the word ναύκραρος therefore cannot be derived\r\nfrom ναῦς, ship, but must come from ναιω, and ναύκραρος is thus only\r\nanother form for ναύκληρος in the sense of a householder, as ναῦλον\r\nwas used for the rent of a house. Solon in his legislation retained\r\nthe old institution of the naucraries, and charged each of them with\r\nthe equipment of one trireme and with the mounting of two horsemen.\r\nAll military affairs, as far as regards the defraying of expenses,\r\nprobably continued as before to be regulated according to naucraries.\r\nCleisthenes, in his change of the Solonian constitution, retained\r\nthe division into naucraries for military and financial purposes;\r\nbut he increased their number to fifty, making five for each of his\r\nten tribes; so that now the number of their ships was increased from\r\nforty-eight to fifty, and that of horsemen from ninety-six to one\r\nhundred. The statement of Herodotus, that the Athenians in their war\r\nagainst Aegina had only fifty ships of their own, is thus perfectly\r\nin accordance with the fifty naucraries of Cleisthenes. The functions\r\nof the former ναύκραροι, or the heads of their respective naucraries,\r\nwere now transferred to the demarchs. [DEMARCHI.] The obligation of\r\neach naucrary to equip a ship of war for the service of the republic\r\nmay be regarded as the first form of trierarchy. As the system of\r\ntrierarchy became developed and established, this obligation of the\r\nnaucraries appears to have gradually ceased, and to have fallen into\r\ndisuse. [TRIERARCHIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUCRĀRUS. [NAUCRARIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNĀVIS, NĀVĬGIUM (ναῦς, πλοῖον), a ship. The numerous fleet, with\r\nwhich the Greeks are said to have sailed to the coast of Asia Minor,\r\nmust on the whole be regarded as sufficient evidence of the extent\r\nto which navigation was carried on in those times, however much\r\nof the detail in the Homeric description may have arisen from the\r\npoet’s own imagination. In the Homeric catalogue it is stated that\r\neach of the fifty Boeotian ships carried 120 warriors, and a ship\r\nwhich carried so many cannot have been of very small dimensions. What\r\nHomer states of the Boeotian vessels applies more or less to the\r\nships of other Greeks. These boats were provided with a mast (ἱστός)\r\nwhich was fastened by two ropes (πρότονοι) to the two ends of the\r\nship, so that when the rope connecting it with the prow broke, the\r\nmast would fall towards the stern, where it might kill the helmsman.\r\nThe mast could be erected or taken down as necessity required. They\r\nalso had sails (ἱστία), but no deck; each vessel however appears to\r\nhave had only one sail, which was used in favourable winds; and the\r\nprincipal means of propelling the vessel lay in the rowers, who sat\r\nupon benches (κληΐδες). The oars were fastened to the side of the\r\nship with leathern thongs (τροποὶ δερμάτινοι), in which they were\r\nturned as a key in its hole. The ships in Homer are mostly called\r\nblack (μέλαιναι), probably because they were painted or covered with\r\na black substance, such as pitch, to protect the wood against the\r\ninfluence of the water and the air; sometimes other colours, such\r\nas μίλτος, _minium_ (a red colour), were used to adorn the sides\r\nof the ships near the prow, whence Homer occasionally calls ships\r\nμιλτοπάρῃοι, i.e. red-cheeked; they were also painted occasionally\r\nwith a purple colour (φοινικοπάρῃοι). When the Greeks had landed on\r\nthe coast of Troy, the ships were drawn on land, and fastened at\r\nthe poop to large stones with a rope which served as anchors. The\r\nGreeks then surrounded the fleet with a fortification to secure it\r\nagainst the attacks of the enemy. This custom of drawing the ships\r\nupon the shore, when they were not used, was followed in later times\r\nalso, as every one will remember from the accounts in Caesar’s\r\nCommentaries. In the Odyssey (v. 243, &c.) the building of a boat\r\n(σχεδία) is described, though not with the minuteness which an\r\nactual ship-builder might wish for. Ulysses first cuts down with his\r\naxe twenty trees, and prepares the wood for his purpose by cutting\r\nit smooth and giving it the proper shape. He then bores the holes\r\nfor nails and hooks, and fits the planks together and fastens them\r\nwith nails. He rounds the bottom of the ship like that of a broad\r\ntransport vessel, and raises the bulwark (ἴκρια), fitting it upon\r\nthe numerous ribs of the ship. He afterwards covers the whole of the\r\noutside with planks, which are laid across the ribs from the keel\r\nupwards to the bulwark: next the mast is made, and the sail-yard\r\nattached to it, and lastly the rudder. When the ship is thus far\r\ncompleted, he raises the bulwark still higher by a wicker-work which\r\ngoes all around the vessel, as a protection against the waves. This\r\nraised bulwark of wicker-work and the like was used in later times\r\nalso. For ballast Ulysses throws into the ship ὕλη, which according\r\nto the Scholiast consisted of wood, stones, and sand. Calypso then\r\nbrings him materials to make a sail of, and he fastens the ὑπέραι or\r\nropes which run from the top of the mast to the two ends of the yard,\r\nand also the κάλοι with which the sail is drawn up or let down. The\r\nπόδες mentioned in this passage were undoubtedly, as in the later\r\ntimes, the ropes attached to the two lower corners of the square\r\nsail. The ship of which the building is thus described was a small\r\nboat, a σχεδία, as Homer calls it; but it had like all the Homeric\r\nships a round or flat bottom. Greater ships must have been of a more\r\ncomplicated structure, as ship-builders are praised as artists. Below\r\n(p. 266), a representation of two boats is given which appear to\r\nbear great resemblance to the one of which the building is described\r\nin the Odyssey.--The Corinthians were the first who brought the art\r\nof ship-building nearest to the point at which we find it in the\r\ntime of Thucydides, and they were the first who introduced ships\r\nwith three ranks of rowers (τριήρεις, _Triremes_). About B.C. 700,\r\nAmeinocles the Corinthian, to whom this invention is ascribed, made\r\nthe Samians acquainted with it; but it must have been preceded by\r\nthat of the _Biremes_, that is, ships with two ranks of rowers, which\r\nPliny attributes to the Erythraeans.[3] These innovations however\r\ndo not seem to have been generally adopted for a long time; for we\r\nread that about the time of Cyrus the Phocaeans introduced long\r\nsharp-keeled ships called πεντηκόντοροι. These belonged to the class\r\nof long war-ships (νῆες μακραί), and had fifty rowers, twenty-five on\r\neach side of the ship, who sat in one row. It is further stated that\r\nbefore this time vessels called στρογγύλαι, with large round or\r\nrather flat bottoms, had been used exclusively by all the Ionians in\r\nAsia. At this period most Greeks seem to have adopted the long ships\r\nwith only one rank of rowers on each side (Moneris).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Moneris. (Montfaucon, vol. IV. pt. II. pl. 142.)]\r\n\r\nTheir name varied accordingly as they had fifty (πεντηκόντοροι), or\r\nthirty (τριακόντοροι), or even a smaller number of rowers. A ship\r\nof war of this class is represented in the preceding woodcut. The\r\nfollowing cut contains a beautiful fragment of a Biremis with a\r\ncomplete deck. Another specimen of a small Biremis is given further\r\non.--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Biremis. (Winckelmann, pl. 207.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Navis Aperta. (Coin of Corcyra.)]\r\n\r\nThe first Greek people whom we know to have acquired a navy of\r\nimportance were the Corinthians, Samians, and Phocaeans. About the\r\ntime of Cyrus and Cambyses the Corinthian Triremes were generally\r\nadopted by the Sicilian tyrants and by the Corcyraeans, who soon\r\nacquired the most powerful navies among the Greeks. In other parts of\r\nGreece and even at Athens and in Aegina the most common vessels about\r\nthis time were long ships with only one rank of rowers on each side.\r\nAthens, although the foundation of its maritime power had been laid\r\nby Solon [NAUCRARIA], did not obtain a fleet of any importance until\r\nthe time of Themistocles, who persuaded the Athenians to build 200\r\nTriremes for the purpose of carrying on the war against Aegina. But\r\neven then ships were not provided with complete decks (καταστρώματα)\r\ncovering the whole of the vessel. Ships with only a partial deck or\r\nwith no deck at all, were called ἄφρακτοι νῆες, and in Latin _naves\r\napertae_. Even at the time of the Persian war, the Athenian ships\r\nwere without a complete deck. Ships which had a complete deck were\r\ncalled κατάφρακτοι, and the deck itself κατάστρωμα. At the time when\r\nThemistocles induced the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 sail he\r\nalso carried a decree, that every year twenty new Triremes should\r\nbe built from the produce of the mines of Laurium. After the time\r\nof Themistocles as many as twenty Triremes must have been built\r\nevery year both in times of war and of peace, as the average number\r\nof Triremes which was always ready amounted to between three and\r\nfour hundred. Such an annual addition was the more necessary, as\r\nthe vessels were of a light structure and did not last long. The\r\nwhole superintendence of the building of new Triremes was in the\r\nhands of the senate of the Five Hundred, but the actual business was\r\nentrusted to a committee called the τριηροποιοί, one of whom acted\r\nas their treasurer, and had in his keeping the money set apart for\r\nthe purpose. Under the Macedonian supremacy the Rhodians became the\r\ngreatest maritime power in Greece. The navy of Sparta was never of\r\ngreat importance. Navigation remained for the most part what it had\r\nbeen before; the Greeks seldom ventured out into the open sea, and\r\nit was generally considered necessary to remain in sight of the\r\ncoast or of some island, which also served as guides in daytime: in\r\nthe night the position, rising and setting of the different stars\r\nanswered the same purpose. In winter navigation generally ceased\r\naltogether. In cases where it would have been necessary to coast\r\naround a considerable extent of country, which was connected with the\r\nmain land by a narrow neck, the ships were sometimes drawn across the\r\nneck of land from one sea to the other, by machines called ὁλκοί.\r\nThis was done most frequently across the isthmus of Corinth.--The\r\nvarious kinds of ships used by the Greeks might be divided, according\r\nto the number of ranks of rowers employed in them, into Moneres,\r\nBiremes, Triremes, Quadriremes, Quinqueremes, &c., up to the enormous\r\nship with forty ranks of rowers, built by Ptolemaeus Philopator. But\r\nall these appear to have been constructed on the same principle,\r\nand it is more convenient to divide them into _ships of war_ and\r\n_ships of burden_ (φορτικὰ, φορτηγοὶ, ὁλκάδες, πλοῖα, στρογγύλαι,\r\n_naves onerariae_, _naves actuariae_). Ships of the latter kind were\r\nnot calculated for quick movement or rapid sailing, but to carry the\r\ngreatest possible quantity of goods. Hence their structure was bulky,\r\ntheir bottom round, and although they were not without rowers, yet\r\nthe chief means by which they were propelled were their sails. The\r\nmost common ships of war in the earlier times were the pentecontori\r\n(πεντηκόντοροι), but afterwards they were chiefly Triremes, and\r\nthe latter are frequently designated only by the name νῆες, while\r\nall the others are called by the name indicating their peculiar\r\ncharacter. Triremes however were again divided into two classes:\r\nthe one consisting of real men-of-war, which were quick-sailing\r\nvessels (ταχεῖαι), and the other of transports either for soldiers\r\n(στρατιώτιδες or ὁπλιταγωγοί) or for horses (ἱππηγοί, ἱππαγωγοί).\r\nShips of this class were more heavy and awkward, and were therefore\r\nnot used in battle except in cases of necessity. The ordinary size of\r\na war galley may be inferred from the fact that the average number of\r\nmen engaged in it, including the crew and marines, was two hundred,\r\nto whom on some occasions as many as thirty epibatae were added.\r\n[EPIBATAE.]--Vessels with more than three ranks of rowers on each\r\nside were not constructed in Greece till about the year 400 B.C.,\r\nwhen Dionysius I., tyrant of Syracuse, who bestowed great care upon\r\nhis navy, built the first Quadriremes (τετρήρεις), and Quinqueremes\r\n(πεντήρεις). In the reign of Dionysius II., Hexeres (ἑξήρεις) are\r\nalso mentioned. After the time of Alexander the Great the use of\r\nvessels with four, five, and more ranks of rowers became very\r\ngeneral, and it is well known that the first Punic war was chiefly\r\ncarried on with Quinqueremes. Ships with twelve, thirty, or even\r\nforty ranks of rowers, such as they were built by Alexander and the\r\nPtolemies, appear to have been mere curiosities, and did not come\r\ninto common use. The Athenians at first did not adopt vessels larger\r\nthan Triremes, probably because they thought that with rapidity and\r\nskill they could do more than with large and unwieldy ships. In the\r\nyear B.C. 356 they continued to use nothing but Triremes; but in\r\nB.C. 330 the republic had already a number of Quadriremes, which was\r\nafterwards increased. The first Quinqueremes at Athens are mentioned\r\nin a document belonging to the year B.C. 325.--Among the smaller\r\nvessels we may mention the ἄκατος or ἀκάτιον, which seems to have\r\nbeen sometimes used as a ship of burden. The name Scapha (σκάφη)\r\ndenotes a small skiff or life-boat, which was commonly attached to\r\nmerchantmen for the purpose of saving the crew in danger.--_Liburna_,\r\nor _Liburnica_, in Greek λιβυρνίς or λιβυρνόν, is a name given\r\napparently to every war-ship, from a bireme up to those with six\r\nlines of rowers on each side, but in the time of Augustus, liburnae\r\neven with six lines of rowers were considered small and swift in\r\ncomparison with the unwieldy ships of Antony at Actium. They were\r\nusually provided with a beak, whence a _navis rostrata_ is generally\r\nthe same as a Liburna. They were first constructed by the Liburnians\r\n(whence they derived their name), and formed the main part of the\r\nfleet of Augustus in the battle of Actium.--Every vessel at Athens,\r\nas in modern times, had a name given to it, which was generally\r\nof the feminine gender. The Romans sometimes gave to their ships\r\nmasculine names. The Greek names were either taken from ancient\r\nheroines such as Nausicaa, or they were abstract words such as\r\n_Forethought_, _Safety_, _Guidance_, &c. In many cases the name of\r\nthe builder also was added.--The Romans appear to have first become\r\naware of the importance of a fleet during the second Samnite war,\r\nin the year B.C. 311: when _duumviri navales_ were for the first\r\ntime appointed by the people. The ships which the Romans now built\r\nwere undoubtedly Triremes. This fleet, however insignificant it may\r\nhave been, continued to be kept up until the time when Rome became a\r\nreal maritime power. In the year B.C. 260, when the Romans saw that\r\nwithout a navy they could not carry on the war against Carthage with\r\nany advantage, the senate ordained that a fleet should be built.\r\nTriremes would now have been of no avail against the high-bulwarked\r\nvessels (Quinqueremes) of the Carthaginians. But the Romans would\r\nhave been unable to build others had not fortunately a Carthaginian\r\nQuinquereme been wrecked on the coast of Bruttium, and fallen into\r\ntheir hands. This wreck the Romans took as their model, and after it\r\nbuilt 120, or according to others 130 ships. From this time forward\r\nthe Romans continued to keep up a powerful navy. Towards the end of\r\nthe Republic they also increased the size of their ships, and built\r\nwar vessels of from six to ten ranks of rowers. The construction of\r\ntheir ships, however, scarcely differed from that of Greek vessels;\r\nthe only great difference was that the Roman galleys were provided\r\nwith a greater variety of destructive engines of war than those of\r\nthe Greeks. They even erected turres and tabulata upon the decks of\r\ntheir great men-of-war (_naves turritae_), and fought upon them as if\r\nthey were standing upon the walls of a fortress (see cut, p. 260).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIREMIS.\r\n\r\n  A. _Prora_, πρώρα.\r\n  B. _Oculus_, ὀφθαλμός.\r\n  C. _Rostrum_, ἔμβολος.\r\n  D. _Cheniscus_, χηνίσκος.\r\n  E. _Puppis_, πρύμνη.\r\n  F. _Aplustre_, ἄφλαστον, with the pole containing the _fascia_ or _taenia_.\r\n  G. τράφηξ.\r\n  H. _Remi_, κώπαι.\r\n  I. _Gubernaculum_, πηδάλιον.\r\n  K. _Malus_, ἱστός.\r\n  L. _Velum_, ἱστός.\r\n  M. _Antenna_, κεραία, κέρας.\r\n  N. _Cornua_, ἀκροκέραιαι.\r\n  O. _Ceruchi_, κεροῦχοι.\r\n  P. _Carchesium_, καρχήσιον.\r\n  Q. κάλοι, καλῴδια.\r\n  R. πρότονος.\r\n  S. _Pedes_, πόδες.\r\n  T. _Opifera_, ὑπέραι.]\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to describe the parts of ancient vessels.--1. The prow\r\n(πρώρα or μέτωπον, prora) was generally ornamented on both sides\r\nwith figures, which were either painted upon the sides or laid in.\r\nIt seems to have been very common to represent an eye on each side\r\nof the prow. Upon the prow or fore-deck there was always some emblem\r\n(παράσημον, insigne, figura) by which the ship was distinguished from\r\nothers. At the head of the prow there projected the στόλος, and its\r\nextremity was termed ἀκροστόλιον, which was frequently made in the\r\nshape of an animal or a helmet. It appears to have been sometimes\r\ncovered with brass and to have served as an embole (ἐμβολή) against\r\nthe enemy’s vessels. The ἀκροστόλιον is sometimes designated by\r\nthe name of χηνίσκος(from χήν, a goose), because it was formed\r\nin the shape of the head or neck of a goose or swan, as in the\r\naccompanying woodcut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cheniscus. (From a Painting at Herculaneum.)]\r\n\r\nThe cheniscus was often gilt and made of bronze. Just below the prow\r\nand projecting a little above the keel was the _Rostrum_ (ἔμβολος,\r\nἔμβολον) or beak, which consisted of a beam, to which were attached\r\nsharp and pointed irons, or the head of a ram and the like. This\r\nἔμβολος was used for the purpose of attacking another vessel and of\r\nbreaking its sides. These beaks were at first always above the water\r\nand visible; afterwards they were attached lower, so that they were\r\ninvisible, and thus became still more dangerous to other ships. The\r\nannexed woodcuts represent three different beaks of ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rostra, Beaks of Ships. (Montfaucon, pl. 133.)]\r\n\r\nThe command in the prow of a vessel was exercised by an officer\r\ncalled πρωρεύς, who seems to have been next in rank to the steersman,\r\nand to have had the care of the gear, and the command over the\r\nrowers.--2. _The stern_ (πρύμνη, _puppis_) was generally above the\r\nother parts of the deck, and in it the helmsman had his elevated\r\nseat. It is seen in the representations of ancient vessels to be\r\nrounder than the prow, though its extremity is likewise sharp. The\r\nstern was, like the prow, adorned in various ways, but especially\r\nwith the image of the tutelary deity of the vessel (_tutela_). In\r\nsome representations a kind of roof is formed over the head of the\r\nsteersman, and the upper part of the stern frequently has an elegant\r\nornament called _aplustre_, and in Greek ἄφλαστον, which constituted\r\nthe highest part of the poop. It formed a corresponding ornament to\r\nthe ἀκροστόλιον at the prow. At the junction of the aplustre with\r\nthe stern on which it was based, we commonly observe an ornament\r\nresembling a circular shield: this was called ἀσπιδεῖον or ἀσπιδίσκη.\r\nIt is seen on the two aplustria here represented. The aplustre rose\r\nimmediately behind the gubernator, and served in some degree to\r\nprotect him from wind and rain. Sometimes there appears, beside the\r\naplustre, a pole, to which a fillet or pennon (ταινία) was attached,\r\nwhich served both to distinguish and adorn the vessel, and also to\r\nshow the direction of the wind.--3. The τράφηξ is the bulwark of the\r\nvessel, or rather the uppermost edge of it. In small boats the pegs\r\n(σκαλμοί, _scalmi_) between which the oars move, and to which they\r\nare fastened by a thong (τροπωτήρ), were upon the τράφηξ. In all\r\nother vessels the oars passed through holes in the side of the vessel\r\n(ὀφθαλμοί, τρήματα, or τρυπήματα).--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aphlaston, Aplustre.]\r\n\r\n4. The middle part of the deck in most ships of war appears to have\r\nbeen raised above the bulwark, or at least to a level with its upper\r\nedge, and thus enabled the soldiers to occupy a position from which\r\nthey could see far around and hurl their darts against the enemy.\r\nSuch an elevated deck appears in the annexed woodcut representing a\r\n_Moneris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Moneris. (From a Painting at Pompeii.)]\r\n\r\nIn this instance the flag is standing upon the hind-deck.--5. One of\r\nthe most interesting, as well as important parts in the arrangements\r\nof the Biremes, Triremes, &c., is the position of the ranks of\r\nrowers, from which the ships themselves derive their names. Various\r\nopinions have been entertained by those who have written upon this\r\nsubject. Thus much is certain, that the different ranks of rowers,\r\nwho sat along the sides of a vessel, were placed one above the\r\nother. In ordinary vessels, from the Moneris up to the Quinqueremis,\r\neach oar was managed by one man. The rowers sat upon little benches\r\nattached to the ribs of the vessel, and called ἑδώλια, and in Latin\r\n_fori_ and _transtra_. The lowest row of rowers was called θαλάμος,\r\nthe rowers themselves, θαλαμῖται or θαλάμιοι. The uppermost ordo of\r\nrowers was called θράνος, and the rowers themselves θρανῖται. The\r\nmiddle ordo or ordines of rowers were called ζυγὰ, ζύγιοι or ζυγῖται.\r\nEach of this last class of rowers had likewise his own seat, and\r\ndid not, as some have supposed, sit upon benches running across the\r\nvessel. The gear of a vessel was divided into _wooden_ and _hanging\r\ngear_ (σκεύη ξύλινα, and σκεύη κρεμαστά).\r\n\r\nI. WOODEN GEAR.--1. _Oars_ (κώπαι, remi). The collective term for\r\noars is ταῤῥός, which properly signified only the blade or flat\r\npart of the oar, but was afterwards used as a collective expression\r\nfor all the oars, with the exception of the rudder. The oars varied\r\nin size accordingly as they were used by a lower or higher ordo of\r\nrowers, and from the name of the ordo by which they were used, they\r\nalso received their special names, viz., κώπαι θαλάμιαι, ζύγιαι, and\r\nθρανίτιδες. Each Trireme had on an average 170 rowers. In a Roman\r\nQuinquereme during the first Punic war, the average number of rowers\r\nwas 300; in later times we even find as many as 400. The lower part\r\nof the holes through which the oars passed appears to have been\r\ncovered with leather (ἄσκωμα), which also extended a little way\r\noutside the hole.--2. _The rudder_ (πηδάλιον, _gubernaculum_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gubernacula, rudders. (From an ancient Lamp and Gems.)]\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of the rudder, vessels must have been propelled\r\nand guided by the oars alone. This circumstance may account for the\r\nform of the ancient rudder, as well as for the mode of using it. It\r\nwas like an oar with a very broad blade, and was commonly placed on\r\neach side of the stern, not at its extremity. The annexed woodcut\r\npresents examples of its appearance as it is frequently exhibited on\r\ngems, coins, and other works of art. The figure in the centre shows a\r\nTriton blowing the buccina, and holding a rudder over his shoulder.\r\nThe left-hand figure represents a rudder with its helm or tiller\r\ncrossed by the cornucopia. In the third figure Venus leans with her\r\nleft arm upon a rudder to indicate her origin from the sea. The\r\nrudder was managed by the gubernator (κυβερνήτης), who is also called\r\nthe _rector navis_ as distinguished from the _magister_. A ship had\r\nsometimes one, but more commonly two rudders; but they were managed\r\nby the steersman to prevent confusion. In larger ships the two\r\nrudders were joined by a pole, which was moved by the gubernator,\r\nand kept the rudders parallel. The contrivances for attaching the\r\ntwo rudders to one another and to the sides of the ship, are called\r\nζεῦγλαι or ζευκτηρίαι.--3. _Ladders_ (κλιμακίδες, _scalae_). Each\r\nTrireme had two wooden ladders, and the same seems to have been the\r\ncase in τριακόντοροι.--4. _Poles_ or punt poles (κοντοί, _conti_).\r\nThree of these, of different lengths, belonged to every Trireme.--5.\r\nΠαραστάται or supports for the masts. They seem to have been a kind\r\nof props placed at the foot of the masts.--6. The _mast_ (ἱστός,\r\n_malus_). The ancients had vessels with one, two, or three masts.\r\nThe fore-mast was called ἀκάτειος, the mainmast, ἱστὸς μέγας. A\r\ntriaconter, or a vessel with 30 rowers, had likewise two masts, and\r\nthe smaller mast here, as well as in a trireme, was near the prow.\r\nIn three-masted vessels the largest mast was nearest the stern. The\r\nmasts as well as the yards were usually of fir. The part of the mast\r\nimmediately above the yard (_antenna_), formed a structure similar to\r\na drinking-cup, and bore the name of _carchesium_ (καρχήσιον). Into\r\nit the mariners ascended in order to manage the sail, to obtain a\r\ndistant view, or to discharge missiles. Breastworks (θωράκια) were\r\nfixed to these structures, so as to supply the place of defensive\r\narmour; and pulleys (τροχηλίαι, _trochleae_) for hoisting up stones\r\nand weapons from below. The continuation of the mast above the\r\ncarchesium was called the “distaff” (ἠλακάτη), corresponding to\r\nour top-mast or top-gallant mast.--7. The _yards_ (κέρα, κεραίαι,\r\n_antennae_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ceruchi. (From an ancient Lamp.)]\r\n\r\nThe mainyard was fastened to the top of the mast by ropes termed\r\n_ceruchi_, as seen in the preceding woodcut. To the mainyard was\r\nattached the mainsail, which was hoisted or let down as the occasion\r\nmight require. In the two extremities of the yard (_cornua_,\r\nἀκροκέραιαι), ropes (_ceruchi_, κηροῦχοι) were attached, which passed\r\nto the top of the mast; and by means of these ropes and the pulleys\r\nconnected with them, the yard and sail, guided by the hoop, were\r\nhoisted to the height required. There are numerous representations of\r\nancient ships in which the antenna is seen, as in the two woodcuts\r\nhere appended. In the second of them there are ropes hanging down\r\nfrom the antenna, the object of which was to enable the sailors to\r\nturn the antenna and the sail according to the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antennae. (From ancient Gems.)]\r\n\r\nII. HANGING GEAR.--1. _Hypozomata_ (Ὑποζώματα), thick and broad ropes\r\nrunning in a horizontal direction around the ship from the stern to\r\nthe prow, and intended to keep the whole fabric together. They ran\r\nround the vessel in several circles, and at certain distances from\r\none another. The Latin name for ὑπόζωμα is _tormentum_. Sometimes\r\nthey were taken on board when a vessel sailed, and not put on till\r\nit was thought necessary. The act of putting them on was called\r\nὑποζωννύναι, or διαζωννύναι, or ζῶσαι. A Trireme required four\r\nὑποζώματα.--2. _The sail_ (Ἱστίον, _velum_). Most ancient ships had\r\nonly one sail, which was attached with the yard to the great mast. In\r\na Trireme also one sail might be sufficient, but the trierarch might\r\nnevertheless add a second. As each of the two masts of a Trireme\r\nhad two sail-yards, it further follows that each mast might have\r\ntwo sails, one of which was placed lower than the other. The two\r\nbelonging to the mainmast were called ἱστία μεγάλα, and those of the\r\nfore-mast ἱστία ἀκάτεια. The former were used on ordinary occasions,\r\nbut the latter probably only in cases when it was necessary to sail\r\nwith extraordinary speed. The sails of the Attic war-galleys, and\r\nof most ancient ships in general, were of a square form. Whether\r\ntriangular sails were ever used by the Greeks, as has been frequently\r\nsupposed, is very doubtful. The Romans, however, used triangular\r\nsails, which they called _Suppara_, and which had the shape of an\r\ninverted Greek Δ (⛛), the upper side of which was attached to the\r\nyard.--3. _Cordage_ (τοπεῖα) differed from the σχοινία or κάλοι.\r\nThe σχοινία (_funes_) are the strong ropes to which the anchors\r\nwere attached, and by which a ship was fastened to the land; while\r\nthe τοπεῖα were a lighter kind of ropes and made with greater care,\r\nwhich were attached to the masts, yards, and sails. Each rope of this\r\nkind was made for a distinct purpose and place (τόπος, whence the\r\nname τοπεῖα). The following kinds are most worthy of notice:--_a_.\r\nκαλῴδια or κάλοι, were probably the ropes by which the mast was\r\nfastened to both sides of the ship, so that the πρότονοι in the\r\nHomeric ships were only an especial kind of καλῴδια, or the καλῴδια\r\nthemselves differently placed. In later times the πρότονος was the\r\nrope which went from the top of the mainmast (καρχήσιον) to the prow\r\nof the ship, and thus was what is now called the main-stay. _b_.\r\n_Ceruchi_ (κεροῦχοι, ἱμάντες), ropes which ran from the two ends\r\nof the sail-yard to the top of the mast. In more ancient vessels\r\nthe ἱμὰς consisted of only one rope; in later times it consisted of\r\ntwo, and sometimes four, which uniting at the top of the mast, and\r\nthere passing through a ring, descended on the other side, where it\r\nformed the ἐπίτονος, by means of which the sail was drawn up or let\r\ndown. _c_. ἄγκοινα, Latin _anquina_, was the rope which went from\r\nthe middle of a yard to the top of the mast, and was intended to\r\nfacilitate the drawing up and letting down of the sail. _d_. Πόδες\r\n(_pedes_) were in later times, as in the poems of Homer, the ropes\r\nattached to the two lower corners of a square sail. These πόδες ran\r\nfrom the ends of the sail to the sides of the vessel towards the\r\nstern, where they were fastened with rings attached to the outer\r\nside of the bulwark. _e_. Ὑπέραι were the two ropes attached to the\r\ntwo ends of the sail-yard, and thence came down to a part of the\r\nship near the stern. Their object was to move the yard according to\r\nthe wind. In Latin they are called _opifera_, which is, perhaps,\r\nonly a corruption of _hypera_.--4. Παραῤῥύματα. The ancients as\r\nearly as the time of Homer had various preparations raised above\r\nthe edge of a vessel, which were made of skins and wicker-work, and\r\nwhich were intended as a protection against high waves, and also to\r\nserve as a kind of breast-work behind which the men might be safe\r\nagainst the darts of the enemy. These elevations of the bulwark are\r\ncalled παραῤῥύματα. They were probably fixed upon the edge on both\r\nsides of the vessel, and were taken off when not wanted. Each galley\r\nappears to have had several παραῤῥύματα, two made of hair and two\r\nwhite ones, these four being regularly mentioned as belonging to one\r\nship.--5. Σχοινία are the stronger and heavier kinds of ropes. There\r\nwere two kinds of these, viz. the σχοινία ἀγκύρεια, to which the\r\nanchor was attached, and σχοινία ἐπίγυα or ἐπίγεια (_retinacula_),\r\nby which the ship was fastened to the shore or drawn upon the\r\nshore.--6. The _anchor_ (ἀγκύρα, _ancora_). We have already remarked\r\nthat in the Homeric age anchors were not known, and large stones\r\n(εὐναὶ, _sleepers_) used in their stead. When anchors came to be\r\nused, they were generally made of iron, and their form resembled\r\nthat of a modern anchor. Such an anchor was often termed _bidens_,\r\nδιπλῆ, ἀμφίβολος or ἀμφίστομος, because it had two teeth or flukes;\r\nbut sometimes it had only one, and was then called ἑτεροστόμος.\r\nThe technical expressions in the use of the anchor are: _ancoram\r\nsolvere_, ἀγκύραν χαλᾷν, to loose the anchor; _ancoram jacere_,\r\nἀγκύραν βάλλειν or ῥίπτειν, to cast anchor; and _ancoram tollere_,\r\nἀγκύραν αἴρειν or ἀναίρεσθαι, to weigh anchor, whence αἴρειν by\r\nitself means “to set sail,” ἀγκύραν being understood. The following\r\nfigure shows the cable (_funis_), passing through a hole in the\r\nprow (_oculus_). Each ship of course had several anchors. The last\r\nor most powerful anchor, “the last hope,” was called ἱερά, _sacra_,\r\nand persons trying their last hope were said _sacram solvere_.--The\r\npreceding account of the different parts of the ship will be rendered\r\nstill clearer by the drawing on p. 263.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Biremis. (From a Marble at Rome.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] Biremes are sometimes called by the Greeks δίκροτα. The name\r\nbiremis is also applied to a little boat managed by only two oars.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUMĂCHIA, the name given to the representation of a sea-fight\r\namong the Romans, and also to the place where such engagements\r\nwere exhibited. These fights sometimes took place in the circus or\r\namphitheatre, sufficient water being introduced to float ships, but\r\nmore generally in buildings especially devoted to this purpose.\r\nThe combatants in these sea-fights, called _Naumachiarii_, were\r\nusually captives, or criminals condemned to death, who fought as in\r\ngladiatorial combats, until one party was killed, unless preserved\r\nby the clemency of the emperor. The ships engaged in the sea fights\r\nwere divided into two parties, called respectively by the names of\r\ndifferent maritime nations, as Tyrians and Egyptians, Rhodians and\r\nSicilians, Persians and Athenians, Corcyraeans and Corinthians,\r\nAthenians and Syracusans, &c. These sea-fights were exhibited with\r\nthe same magnificence and lavish expenditure of human life as\r\ncharacterised the gladiatorial combats and other public games of the\r\nRomans. In Nero’s naumachia there were sea-monsters swimming about in\r\nthe artificial lake. In the sea-fight exhibited by Titus there were\r\n3000 men engaged, and in that exhibited by Domitian the ships were\r\nalmost equal in number to two real fleets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUTŎDĬCAE (ναυτόδικαι), magistrates at Athens, who had jurisdiction\r\nin matters belonging to navigation and commerce, and in matters\r\nconcerning such persons as had entered their names as members of\r\na phratria without both their parents being citizens of Athens,\r\nor in other words, in the δίκαι ἐμπόρων and δίκαι ξενίας. The time\r\nwhen nautodicae were first instituted is not mentioned, but it must\r\nhave been previous to Pericles, and perhaps as early as the time of\r\nCleisthenes. The nautodicae were appointed every year by lot in the\r\nmonth of Gamelion, and probably attended to the δίκαι ἐμπόρων only\r\nduring the winter, when navigation ceased, whereas the δίκαι ξενίας\r\nmight be brought before them all the year round.\r\n\r\n\r\nNĔFASTI DIES. [DIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNĔGŌTĬĀTŌRES, signified specially during the later times of the\r\nrepublic Roman citizens settled in the provinces, who lent money\r\nupon interest or bought up corn on speculation, which they sent to\r\nRome as well as to other places. Their chief business however was\r\nlending money upon interest, and hence we find the words _negotia_,\r\n_negotiatio_, and _negotiari_ used in this sense. The _negotiatores_\r\nare distinguished from the _publicani_, and from the _mercatores_.\r\nThe _negotiatores_ in the provinces corresponded to the _argentarii_\r\nand _feneratores_ at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nNĔMEA (νέμεα, νεμεῖα, or νεμαῖα), the Nemean games, one of the four\r\ngreat national festivals of the Greeks. It was held at Nemea, a\r\nplace near Cleonae in Argolis, and is said to have been originally\r\ninstituted by the Seven against Thebes in commemoration of the death\r\nof Opheltes, afterwards called Archemorus. The games were revived\r\nby Hercules, after he had slain the Nemean lion; and were from this\r\ntime celebrated in honour of Zeus. They were at first of a warlike\r\ncharacter, and only warriors and their sons were allowed to take part\r\nin them; subsequently, however, they were thrown open to all the\r\nGreeks. The various games were horse-racing, running in armour in the\r\nstadium, wrestling, chariot-racing and the discus, boxing, throwing\r\nthe spear and shooting with the bow, to which we may add musical\r\ncontests. The prize given to the victors was at first a chaplet\r\nof olive-branches, but afterwards a chaplet of green parsley. The\r\npresidency of these games, and the management of them, belonged at\r\ndifferent times to Cleonae, Corinth, and Argos. They were celebrated\r\ntwice in every Olympiad, viz. at the commencement of every second\r\nOlympic year, in the winter, and soon after the commencement of every\r\nfourth Olympic year, in the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNĒNIA. [FUNUS, p. 188, _a._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNĔŌCŎRI (νεωκόροι), signified originally temple-sweepers, but was\r\napplied even in early times to priestly officers of high rank, who\r\nhad the supreme superintendence of temples and their treasures.\r\nUnder the Roman emperors the word was especially applied to those\r\ncities in Asia, which erected temples to the Roman emperors, since\r\nthe whole city in every such case was regarded as the guardian of the\r\nworship of the emperor. Accordingly we frequently find on the coins\r\nof Ephesus, Smyrna, and other cities, the epithet Νεωκόρος, which\r\nalso occurs on the inscriptions of these cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPTŪNĀLĬA, a festival of Neptune, celebrated at Rome, of which very\r\nlittle is known. The day on which it was held was probably the 23rd\r\nof July. In the ancient calendaria this day is marked as _Nept. ludi\r\net feriae_, or _Nept. ludi_, from which we see that the festival was\r\ncelebrated with games.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEXUM, was either the transfer of the ownership of a thing, or the\r\ntransfer of a thing to a creditor as a security; accordingly in\r\none sense Nexum included Mancipium [MANCIPIUM]; in another sense,\r\nMancipium and Nexum are opposed in the same way in which Sale and\r\nMortgage or Pledge are opposed. The formal part of both transactions\r\nconsisted in a transfer _per aes et libram_. The person who became\r\n_nexus_ by the effect of a _nexum_ or _nexus_ (for this form of\r\nthe word also is used) was said _nexum inire_. The phrases _nexi\r\ndatio_, _nexi liberatio_, respectively express the contracting and\r\nthe release from the obligation. The Roman law as to the payment of\r\nborrowed money was very strict. By a law of the Twelve Tables, if the\r\ndebtor admitted the debt, or had been condemned in the amount of the\r\ndebt by a judex, he had thirty days allowed him for payment. At the\r\nexpiration of this time, he was liable to be assigned over to the\r\ncreditor (_addictus_) by the sentence of the praetor. The creditor\r\nwas required to keep him for sixty days in chains, during which time\r\nhe publicly exposed the debtor on three nundinae, and proclaimed the\r\namount of his debt. If no person released the prisoner by paying the\r\ndebt, the creditor might sell him as a slave or put him to death.\r\nIf there were several creditors, the letter of the law allowed them\r\nto cut the debtor in pieces, and to take their share of his body in\r\nproportion to their debt. There is no instance of a creditor ever\r\nhaving adopted this extreme mode of satisfying his debt. But the\r\ncreditor might treat the debtor, who was addictus, as a slave, and\r\ncompel him to work out his debt; and the treatment was often very\r\nsevere. The Lex Poetilia (B.C. 326) alleviated the condition of the\r\nnexi. So far as we can understand its provisions, it set all the nexi\r\nfree, or made them _soluti_, and it enacted that for the future there\r\nshould be no nexum, and that no debtor should for the future be put\r\nin chains.\r\n\r\n\r\nNŌBILES, NŌBĬLĬTAS. In the early periods of the Roman state the\r\nPatricians were the Nobles as opposed to the Plebs. In B.C. 366, the\r\nplebeians obtained the right of being eligible to the consulship,\r\nand finally they obtained access to all the curule magistracies.\r\nThus the two classes were put on the same footing as to political\r\ncapacity; but now a new order of nobility arose. The descendants of\r\nplebeians who had filled curule magistracies, formed a class called\r\nNobiles or men “known,” who were so called by way of distinction\r\nfrom “Ignobiles” or people who were not known. The Nobiles had no\r\nlegal privileges as such; but they were bound together by a common\r\ndistinction derived from a legal title and by a common interest;\r\nand their common interest was to endeavour to confine the election\r\nto all the high magistracies to the members of their body, to the\r\nNobilitas. Thus the descendants of those Plebeians who had won their\r\nway to distinction combined to exclude other Plebeians from the\r\ndistinction which their own ancestors had transmitted to them. The\r\nexternal distinction of the Nobiles was the Jus Imaginum, a right or\r\nprivilege which was apparently established on usage only, and not on\r\nany positive enactments. These Imagines were figures with painted\r\nmasks of wax, made to resemble the person whom they represented; and\r\nthey were placed in the Atrium of the house, apparently in small\r\nwooden receptacles or cases somewhat in the form of temples. The\r\nImagines were accompanied with the tituli or names of distinction\r\nwhich the deceased had acquired; and the tituli were connected in\r\nsome way by lines or branches so as to exhibit the pedigree (stemma)\r\nof the family. These Imagines were generally enclosed in their cases,\r\nbut they were opened on festival days and other great ceremonials,\r\nand crowned with bay (laureatae): they also formed part of a solemn\r\nfuneral procession. It seems probable that the Roman Nobilitas, in\r\nthe strict sense of that term, and the Jus Imaginum, originated\r\nwith the admission of the Plebeians to the consulship B.C. 366. A\r\nplebeian who first attained a Curule office was the founder of his\r\nfamily’s Nobilitas (princeps nobilitatis; auctor generis). Such a\r\nperson could have no imagines of his ancestors; and he could have\r\nnone of his own, for such imagines of a man were not made till after\r\nhe was dead. Such a person then was not nobilis in the full sense of\r\nthe term, nor yet was he ignobilis. He was called by the Romans a\r\n“novus homo” or a new man; and his status or condition was called\r\nNovitas. The term novus homo was never applied to a Patrician. The\r\ntwo most distinguished “novi homines” were C. Marius and M. Tullius\r\nCicero, both natives of an Italian municipium. The Patricians would\r\nof course be jealous of the new nobility; but this new nobility once\r\nformed would easily unite with the old aristocracy of Rome to keep\r\nthe political power in their hands, and to prevent more novi homines\r\nfrom polluting this exclusive class. As early as the second Punic war\r\nthis new class, compounded of Patricians or original aristocrats,\r\nand Nobiles or newly-engrafted aristocrats, was able to exclude novi\r\nhomines from the consulship. They maintained this power to the end\r\nof the republican period, and the consulship continued almost in\r\nthe exclusive possession of the Nobilitas. The _Optimates_ were the\r\nNobilitas and the chief part of the Equites, a rich middle class,\r\nand also all others whose support the Nobilitas and Equites could\r\ncommand, in fact all who were opposed to change that might affect the\r\npower of the Nobilitas and the interests of those whom the Nobilitas\r\nallied with themselves. Optimates in this sense are opposed to\r\nPlebs, to the mass of the people; and Optimates is a wider term than\r\nNobilitas, inasmuch as it would comprehend the Nobilitas and all who\r\nadhered to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNŌMEN (ὄνομα), a name. The Greeks bore only one name, and it was\r\none of the especial rights of a father to choose the names for his\r\nchildren, and to alter them if he pleased. It was customary to give\r\nto the eldest son the name of the grandfather on his father’s side;\r\nand children usually received their names on the tenth day after\r\ntheir birth.--Originally every Roman citizen belonged to a gens, and\r\nderived his name (_nomen_ or _nomen gentilicium_) from his gens,\r\nwhich _nomen gentilicium_ generally terminated in _ius_. Besides\r\nthis, every Roman had a name, called _praenomen_, which preceded the\r\nnomen gentilicium, and which was peculiar to him as an individual,\r\n_e.g._ Caius, Lucius, Marcus, Cneius, Sextus, &c. This praenomen\r\nwas at a later time given to boys on the ninth day after their\r\nbirth, and to girls on the eighth day. This day was called _dies\r\nlustricus_, _dies nominum_, or _nominalia_. The praenomen given to\r\na boy was in most cases that of the father, but sometimes that of\r\nthe grandfather or great-grandfather. These two names, a _praenomen_\r\nand a _nomen gentilicium_, or simply _nomen_, were indispensable\r\nto a Roman, and they were at the same time sufficient to designate\r\nhim; hence the numerous instances of Romans being designated only\r\nby these two names, even in cases where a third or fourth name was\r\npossessed by the person. Every Roman citizen, besides belonging to\r\na gens, was also frequently a member of a familia, contained in a\r\ngens, and accordingly might have a third name or _cognomen_. Such\r\ncognomina were derived by the Romans from a variety of mental or\r\nbodily peculiarities, or from some remarkable event in the life of\r\nthe person who was the founder of the familia. Such cognomina are,\r\nAsper, Imperiosus, Magnus, Maximus, Publicola, Brutus, Capito, Cato,\r\nNaso, Labeo, Caecus, Cicero, Scipio, Sulla, Torquatus, &c. These\r\nnames were in most cases hereditary, and descended to the latest\r\nmembers of a familia; in some cases they ceased with the death of the\r\nperson to whom they were given for special reasons. Many Romans had a\r\nsecond cognomen (_cognomen secundum_ or _agnomen_), which was given\r\nto them as an honorary distinction, and in commemoration of some\r\nmemorable deed or event of their life, _e.g._ Africanus, Asiaticus,\r\nHispallus, Cretensis, Macedonicus, Allobrogicus, &c. Such agnomina\r\nwere sometimes given by one general to another, sometimes by the army\r\nand confirmed by the chief-general, sometimes by the people in the\r\ncomitia, and sometimes they were assumed by the person himself, as\r\nin the case of L. Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus. The regular order in\r\nwhich these names followed one another was:--1. praenomen; 2. nomen\r\ngentilicium; 3. cognomen primum; 4. cognomen secundum or agnomen.\r\nSometimes the name of the tribe to which a person belonged, was added\r\nto his name, in the ablative case, as Q. Verres Romilia, C. Claudius\r\nPalatina. If a person by adoption passed from one gens into another,\r\nhe assumed the praenomen, nomen, and cognomen of his adoptive father,\r\nand added to these the name of his former gens, with the termination\r\n_anus_. Thus C. Octavius, after being adopted by his uncle C. Julius\r\nCaesar, was called C. Julius Caesar Octavianus, and the son of L.\r\nAemilius Paullus, when adopted by P. Cornelius Scipio, was called P.\r\nCornelius Scipio Aemilianus. [ADOPTIO.] Slaves had only one name,\r\nand usually retained that which they had borne before they came\r\ninto slavery. If a slave was restored to freedom, he received the\r\npraenomen and nomen gentilicium of his former master, and to these\r\nwas added the name which he had had as a slave. Instances of such\r\nfreedmen are, T. Ampius Menander, a freedman of T. Ampius Balbus,\r\nL. Cornelius Chrysogonus, a freedman of L. Cornelius Sulla, and M.\r\nTullius Tiro, freedman of M. Tullius Cicero.\r\n\r\n\r\nNŎMŎPHỸLĂCES (νομοφύλακες), certain magistrates or official persons\r\nof high authority, who exercised a control over other magistrates,\r\nand indeed over the whole body of the people, it being their duty to\r\nsee that the laws were duly administered and obeyed. Mention is made\r\nof such officers at Sparta and elsewhere, but no such body existed at\r\nAthens, for they must have had a power too great for the existence of\r\na democracy. The Senate of 500, or the Areopagitic council, performed\r\nin some measure the office of law-guardians; but the only persons\r\ndesignated by this name appear to have been inferior functionaries (a\r\nsort of police), whose business it was to prevent irregularities and\r\ndisturbances in the public assemblies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNŎMOS (νόμος). This word comprehends the notion not only of\r\nestablished or statute law, but likewise of all customs and opinions\r\nto which long prescription or natural feeling gives the force of\r\nlaw. Before any written codes appeared, law was promulgated by the\r\npoets or wise men, who sang the great deeds of their ancestors, and\r\ndelivered their moral and political lessons in verse. As civilisation\r\nadvanced, laws were reduced to writing, in the shape either of\r\nregular codes or distinct ordinances, and afterwards publicly\r\nexhibited, engraved on tablets, or hewn on columns. The first\r\nwritten laws we hear of are those of Zaleucus. The first at Athens\r\nwere those of Draco, called θεσμοὶ, and by that name distinguished\r\nfrom the νόμοι of Solon. The laws of Lycurgus were not written. He\r\nenjoined that they should never be inscribed on any other tablet\r\nthan the hearts of his countrymen. Those of Solon were inscribed on\r\nwooden tablets, arranged in pyramidal blocks, turning on an axis,\r\ncalled ἄξονες and κύρβεις. They were first hung in the Acropolis, but\r\nafterwards brought down to the Prytaneum.\r\n\r\n\r\nNŎMŎTHĔTAE (νομόθεται), movers or proposers of laws, the name of a\r\nlegislative committee at Athens, which, by an institution of Solon,\r\nwas appointed to amend and revise the laws. At the first κυρία\r\nἐκκλησία in every year, any person was at liberty to point out\r\ndefects in the existing code or propose alterations. If his motion\r\nwas deemed worthy of attention, the third assembly might refer\r\nthe matter to the Nomothetae. They were selected by lot from the\r\nHeliastic body; it being the intention of Solon to limit the power\r\nof the popular assembly by means of a superior board emanating from\r\nitself, composed of citizens of mature age, bound by a stricter oath,\r\nand accustomed to weigh legal principles by the exercise of their\r\njudicial functions. The number of the committee so appointed varied\r\naccording to the exigency of the occasion. The people appointed\r\nfive advocates (σύνδικοι) to attend before the board and maintain\r\nthe policy of the existing institution. If the proposed measure\r\nmet the approval of the committee, it passed into law forthwith.\r\nBesides this, the Thesmothetae were officially authorised to review\r\nthe whole code, and to refer to the _Nomothetae_ all statutes which\r\nthey considered unworthy of being retained. Hence appears the\r\ndifference between _Psephisma_ (ψήφισμα) and _Nomos_ (νόμος). The\r\nmere resolution of the people in assembly was a _psephisma_, and only\r\nremained in force a year, like a decree of the senate. Nothing was a\r\n_law_ that did not pass the ordeal of the Nomothetae.\r\n\r\n\r\nNŌNAE. [CALENDARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNŎTA, which signified a mark or sign of any kind, was also employed\r\nfor an abbreviation. Hence _notae_ signified the marks or signs\r\nused in taking down the words of a speaker, and was equivalent to\r\nour short-hand writing, or stenography; and _notarii_ signified\r\nshort-hand writers. It must be borne in mind, however, that _notae_\r\nalso signified writing in cipher; and many passages in the ancient\r\nreciters which are supposed to refer to short-hand, refer in reality\r\nto writing in cipher. Among the Greeks it is said to have been\r\ninvented by Xenophon, and their short-hand writers were called\r\nταχυγράφοι, ὀξυγράφοι and σημειογράφοι. The first introduction of\r\nthe art among the Romans is ascribed to Cicero. He is said to have\r\ncaused the debate in the senate on the punishment of the Catilinarian\r\nconspirators to be taken down in short-hand. Eusebius ascribes it to\r\nTiro, the freedman of Cicero, and hence the system of abbreviated\r\nwriting, in which some manuscripts are written, has received the name\r\nof _Notae Tironianae_; but there is no evidence to show whether this\r\nspecies of short-hand was really the invention of Tiro. The system of\r\nshort-hand employed in the time of the Roman empire must have been of\r\na much simpler and more expeditious kind than the _Notae Tironianae_,\r\nwhich were merely abbreviations of the words. Many of the wealthy\r\nRomans kept slaves, who were trained in the art. It was also\r\nlearnt even by the Roman nobles, and the emperor Titus was a great\r\nproficient in it. At a later time, it seems to have been generally\r\ntaught in the schools. There were, moreover, short-hand writers\r\n(_notarii_) by profession, who were chiefly employed in taking down\r\n(_notare_, _excipere_) the proceedings in the courts of justice. At a\r\nlater period, they were called _exceptores_. These short-hand writers\r\nwere also employed on some occasions to take down a person’s will.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTĀRĬI, short-hand writers, spoken of under NOTA. They were likewise\r\ncalled _Actuarii_. They were also employed by the emperors, and in\r\ncourse of time the title of _Notarii_ was exclusively applied to the\r\nprivate secretaries of the emperors, who, of course, were no longer\r\nslaves, but persons of high rank. The short-hand writers were now\r\ncalled _exceptores_, as is remarked under NOTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNŎTA CENSŌRĬA. [CENSOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNŎVENDĬĀLE (sc. _sacrum_).--(1) A festival lasting nine days,\r\nwhich was celebrated as often as stones rained from heaven. It was\r\noriginally instituted by Tullus Hostilius, when there was a shower of\r\nstones upon the Mons Albanus, and was frequently celebrated in later\r\ntimes.--(2) This name was also given to the sacrifice performed nine\r\ndays after a funeral. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNŎVI HŎMĬNES. [NOBILES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNŪDUS (γυμνός). These words, besides denoting absolute nakedness,\r\nwere applied to any one who, being without an AMICTUS, wore only his\r\ntunic or indutus. In this state of nudity the ancients performed the\r\noperations of ploughing, sowing, and reaping. This term applied to\r\nthe warrior expressed the absence of some part of his armour. Hence\r\nthe light-armed were called γυμνῆτες. [ARMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMMŬLĀRĬI or NŪMŬLĀRII. [MENSARII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMMUS or NŪMUS. [SESTERTIUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUNDĬNAE is derived by all the ancient writers from _novem_ and\r\n_dies_, so that it literally signifies the ninth day. Every eighth\r\nday, according to our mode of speaking, was a nundinae, and there\r\nwere thus always seven ordinary days between two nundinae. The Romans\r\nin their peculiar mode of reckoning added these two nundinae to the\r\nseven ordinary days, and consequently said that the nundinae recurred\r\nevery ninth day, and called them _nundinae_, as it were _novemdinae_.\r\nThe number of nundinae in the ancient year of ten months was 38.\r\nThey were originally market-days for the country folk, on which they\r\ncame to Rome to sell the produce of their labour, and on which the\r\nking settled the legal disputes among them. When, therefore, we read\r\nthat the nundinae were feriae, or dies nefasti, and that no comitia\r\nwere allowed to be held, we have to understand this of the populus\r\nor patricians, and not of the plebes; and while for the populus\r\nthe nundinae were feriae, they were real days of business (_dies\r\nfasti_ or _comitiales_) for the plebeians, who on these occasions\r\npleaded their causes with members of their own order, and held their\r\npublic meetings (the ancient comitia of the plebeians). Afterwards\r\nthe nundinae became fasti for both orders, and this innovation\r\nfacilitated the attendance of the plebeians at the comitia\r\ncenturiata. The subjects to be laid before the comitia, whether they\r\nwere proposals for new laws, or the appointment of officers, were\r\nannounced to the people three nundinae beforehand (_trinundino die\r\nproponere_). Instead of _nundinae_ the form _nundinum_ is sometimes\r\nused, but only when it is preceded by a numeral, as in _trinundinum_,\r\nor _trinum nundinum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUPTĬAE. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nŎBOLUS. [DRACHMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOCRĔA (κνημίς), a greave, a leggin. A pair of greaves (κνημῖδες)\r\nwas one of the six articles of armour which formed the complete\r\nequipment of a Greek warrior [ARMA], and likewise of a Roman soldier\r\nas fixed by Servius Tullius. They were made of various metals, with\r\na lining probably of leather, felt, or cloth. Their form is shown in\r\nthe accompanying cut. The figure is that of a fallen warrior, and\r\nin consequence of the bending of the knees, the greaves are seen to\r\nproject a little above them. This statue also shows the ankle-rings\r\n(ἐπισφύρια), which were used to fasten the greaves immediately above\r\nthe feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ocreae, Greaves. (From the Aeginetan Marbles.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nŌDĒUM (ᾠδεῖον), a species of public building for contests in vocal\r\nand instrumental music. In its general form and arrangements it was\r\nvery similar to the theatre; and it is sometimes called θέατρον.\r\nThere were, however, some characteristic differences: the Odeum was\r\nmuch smaller than the theatre; and it was roofed over, in order to\r\nretain the sound. The earliest building of this kind was that erected\r\nby Pericles at Athens, for the purpose of celebrating the musical\r\ncontests at the Panathenaea. Its proximity to the theatre suggested\r\nsome of the uses made of it, namely, as a refuge for the audience\r\nwhen driven out of the theatre by rain, and also as a place in which\r\nthe chorus could be prepared. Another Odeum was built at Athens by\r\nHerodes Atticus, and was the most magnificent edifice of the sort in\r\nthe whole empire. The length of its largest diameter was 248 feet,\r\nand it is calculated to have furnished accommodation for about 8000\r\npersons. There were also Odea in other Greek towns. The first Odeum,\r\nproperly so called, at Rome, was built by Domitian, and the second by\r\nTrajan. There are ruins of such buildings in the villa of Hadrian at\r\nTivoli, at Pompeii, and at Catana.\r\n\r\n\r\nŎLĔA, ŎLĪVA (ἐλαία); ŎLĔUM, OLĪVUM (ἔλαιον). The importance of\r\nthe olive was recognised from the most remote period of antiquity\r\nin all civilised countries where the temperature admitted of its\r\ncultivation: and it was widely adopted as an emblem of industry and\r\npeace. Hence the honour paid to it at Athens, and hence the title\r\nof “prima omnium arborum,” bestowed upon it by Columella. The fruit\r\n(_bacca_) of the olive was for the most part employed for one of\r\ntwo purposes. 1. It was eaten as a fruit, either fresh, pickled, or\r\npreserved in various ways. 2. It was pressed so as to yield the oil\r\nand other juices which it contained. And again, the oil was employed\r\nfor a variety of purposes, but chiefly 1. As an article of food.\r\n2. For anointing the body, and in this case was frequently made a\r\nvehicle for perfumes (_unguenta_). 3. For burning in lamps.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLĬGARCHĬA (ὀλιγαρχια), the government of a few: a term applied to\r\nthat perversion (παρέκβασις) of an _Aristocratia_ into which the\r\nlatter passed, when, owing to the rise of the _demus_ [DEMOCRATIA],\r\nand the vanishing of those substantial grounds of pre-eminence\r\nwhich rendered an Aristocratia not unjust, the rule of the dominant\r\nportion of the community became the ascendancy of a faction, whose\r\nefforts were directed chiefly towards their own aggrandisement. The\r\npreservation of power under such circumstances of course depended\r\nchiefly upon the possession of superior wealth and the other\r\nappliances of wealth which were its concomitants. Thus it came to be\r\nregarded as essentially characteristic of an oligarchy, that the main\r\ndistinction between the dominant faction and the subject portion of\r\nthe community was the possession of greater wealth on the part of the\r\nformer. Hence the term _Oligarchia_ would not have been applied, if a\r\nsmall section of the community, consisting of _poor_ persons, by any\r\nmeans got the reins of government into their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLLA (λέβης, χύτρος), a vessel of any material, round and plain, and\r\nhaving a wide mouth; a pot; a jar.\r\n\r\n\r\nŎLYMPĬA (ὀλύμπια), the Olympic games, the greatest of the national\r\nfestivals of the Greeks. It was celebrated at Olympia in Elis, the\r\nname given to a small plain to the west of Pisa, which was bounded\r\non the north and north-east by the mountains Cronius and Olympus,\r\non the south by the river Alpheus, and on the west by the Cladeus,\r\nwhich flows into the Alpheus. Olympia does not appear to have been a\r\ntown, but rather a collection of temples and public buildings. The\r\norigin of the Olympic games is buried in obscurity, but the festival\r\nwas of very great antiquity. The first historical fact connected with\r\nthis festival is its revival by Iphitus, king of Elis, who is said\r\nto have accomplished it with the assistance of Lycurgus, the Spartan\r\nlawgiver, and Cleosthenes of Pisa. The date of this event is given\r\nby some writers as B.C. 884, and by others as B.C. 828. The interval\r\nof four years between each celebration of the festival was called\r\nan Olympiad; but the Olympiads were not employed as a chronological\r\naera till the victory of Coroebus in the foot-race, B.C. 776.\r\n[OLYMPIAS.] The most important point in the renewal of the festival\r\nby Iphitus was the establishment of the _Ececheiria_ (ἐκεχειρία),\r\nor sacred armistice. The proclamation was made by peace-heralds\r\n(σπονδοφόροι), first in Elis and afterwards in the other parts of\r\nGreece; it put a stop to all warfare for the month in which the games\r\nwere celebrated, and which was called the _sacred month_ (ἱερομηνία).\r\nThe territory of Elis itself was considered especially sacred during\r\nthe games, and no armed force could enter it without incurring the\r\nguilt of sacrilege. The Olympic festival was probably confined at\r\nfirst to the Peloponnesians; but as its celebrity extended, the\r\nother Greeks took part in it, till at length it became a festival\r\nfor the whole nation. No one was allowed to contend in the games\r\nbut persons of pure Hellenic blood: barbarians might be spectators,\r\nbut slaves were entirely excluded. After the conquest of Greece by\r\nthe Romans, the latter were permitted to take part in the games. No\r\nwomen were allowed to be present or even to cross the Alpheus during\r\nthe celebration of the games, under penalty of being hurled down\r\nfrom the Typaean rock, but women could send chariots to the races.\r\nThe number of spectators at the festival was very great; and these\r\nwere drawn together not merely by the desire of seeing the games,\r\nbut partly through the opportunity it afforded them of carrying on\r\ncommercial transactions with persons from distant places, as is the\r\ncase with the Mohammedan festivals at Mecca and Medina. Many of the\r\npersons present were also deputies (θεωροί) sent to represent the\r\nvarious states of Greece; and we find that these embassies vied with\r\none another in the number of their offerings, and the splendour of\r\ntheir general appearance, in order to support the honour of their\r\nnative cities. The Olympic festival was a Pentaëteris (πενταετηρίς),\r\nthat is, according to the ancient mode of reckoning, a space of four\r\nyears elapsed between each festival, in the same way as there was\r\nonly a space of two years between a Trieteris. It was celebrated on\r\nthe first full moon after the summer solstice. It lasted, after all\r\nthe contests had been introduced, five days, from the 11th to the\r\n15th days of the month inclusive. The fourth day of the festival\r\nwas the 14th of the month, which was the day of the full moon, and\r\nwhich divided the month into two equal parts. The festival was under\r\nthe immediate superintendence of the Olympian Zeus, whose temple at\r\nOlympia, adorned with the statue of the god made by Phidias, was one\r\nof the most splendid works of art in Greece. There were also temples\r\nand altars to most of the other gods. The festival itself may be\r\ndivided into two parts, the games or contests (ἀγὼν Ολυμπιακός),\r\nand the festive rites (ἑορτή) connected with the sacrifices, with\r\nthe processions, and with the public banquets in honour of the\r\nconquerors.--The contests consisted of various trials of strength\r\nand skill, which were increased in number from time to time. There\r\nwere in all twenty-four contests, eighteen in which men took part,\r\nand six in which boys engaged, though they were never all exhibited\r\nat one festival, since some were abolished almost immediately after\r\ntheir institution, and others after they had been in use only a\r\nshort time. We subjoin a list of these from Pausanias, with the\r\ndate of the introduction of each, commencing from the Olympiad of\r\nCoroebus:--1. The foot-race (δρόμος), which was the only contest\r\nduring the first 13 Olympiads. 2. The δίαυλος, or foot-race, in which\r\nthe stadium was traversed twice, first introduced in Ol. 14. 3. The\r\nδόλιχος, a still longer foot-race than the δίαυλος, introduced in Ol.\r\n15. For a more particular account of the δίαυλος and δόλιχος, see\r\nSTADIUM. 4. Wrestling (πάλη), and, 5. The Pentathlum (πένταθλον),\r\nwhich consisted of five exercises [PENTATHLUM], both introduced\r\nin Ol. 18. 6. Boxing (πυγμή) introduced in Ol. 23. [PUGILATUS.]\r\n7. The chariot-race, with four full-grown horses (ἵππων τελείων\r\nδρόμος, ἅρμα), introduced in Ol. 25. 8. The Pancratium (παγκράτιον)\r\n[PANCRATIUM], and 9. The horse-race (ἵππος κέλης), both introduced\r\nin Ol. 33. 10 and 11. The foot-race and wrestling for boys, both\r\nintroduced in Ol. 37. 12. The Pentathlum for boys, introduced in\r\nOl. 38., but immediately afterwards abolished. 13. Boxing for boys,\r\nintroduced in Ol. 41. 14. The foot-race, in which men ran with the\r\nequipments of heavy-armed soldiers (τῶν ὁπλιτῶν δρόμος), introduced\r\nin Ol. 65., on account of its training men for actual service in war.\r\n15. The chariot-race with mules (ἀπήνη), introduced in Ol. 70.; and\r\n16. The horse-race with mares (κάλπη), introduced in Ol. 71., both\r\nof which were abolished in Ol. 84. 17. The chariot-race with two\r\nfull-grown horses (ἵππων τελείων συνωρίς), introduced in Ol. 93. 18,\r\n19. The contest of heralds (κήρυκες) and trumpeters (σαλπιγκταί),\r\nintroduced in Ol. 96. 20. The chariot-race with four foals (πώλων\r\nἅρμασιν), introduced in Ol. 99. 21. The chariot-race with two foals\r\n(πώλων συνωρίς), introduced in Ol. 128. 22. The horse-race with\r\nfoals (πῶλος κέλης), introduced in Ol. 131. 23. The Pancratium\r\nfor boys, introduced in Ol. 145. 24. There was also a horse-race\r\n(ἵππος κέλης) in which boys rode, but we do not know the time of its\r\nintroduction.--The judges in the Olympic Games, called _Hellanodicae_\r\n(Ἑλλανοδίκαι), were appointed by the Eleans, who had the regulation\r\nof the whole festival. It appears to have been originally under the\r\nsuperintendence of Pisa, in the neighbourhood of which Olympia was\r\nsituated, but after the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians\r\non the return of the Heraclidae, the Aetolians, who had been of\r\ngreat assistance to the Heraclidae, settled in Elis, and from this\r\ntime the Aetolian Eleans obtained the regulation of the festival,\r\nand appointed the presiding officers. The Hellanodicae were chosen\r\nby lot from the whole body of the Eleans. Their number varied at\r\ndifferent periods, but at a later time there were eight Hellanodicae.\r\nTheir office probably lasted for only one festival. They had to\r\nsee that all the laws relating to the games were observed by the\r\ncompetitors and others, to determine the prizes, and to give them\r\nto the conquerors. An appeal lay from their decision to the Elean\r\nsenate. Under the direction of the Hellanodicae was a certain number\r\nof _Alytae_ (ἀλύται) with an _Alytarches_ (ἀλυτάρχης) at their head,\r\nwho formed a kind of police, and carried into execution the commands\r\nof the Hellanodicae. There were also various other minor officers\r\nunder the control of the Hellanodicae.--All free Greeks were allowed\r\nto contend in the games, who had complied with the rules prescribed\r\nto candidates. The equestrian contests were necessarily confined to\r\nthe wealthy; but the poorest citizens could contend in the athletic\r\ngames. This, however, was far from degrading the games in public\r\nopinion; and some of the noblest as well as meanest citizens of the\r\nstate took part in these contests. The owners of the chariots and\r\nhorses were not obliged to contend in person; and the wealthy vied\r\nwith one another in the number and magnificence of the chariots and\r\nhorses which they sent to the games. All persons, who were about to\r\ncontend, had to prove to the Hellanodicae that they were freemen, and\r\nof pure Hellenic blood, that they had not been branded with atimia,\r\nnor guilty of any sacrilegious act. They further had to prove that\r\nthey had undergone the preparatory training (προγυμνάσματα) for ten\r\nmonths previous. All competitors were obliged, thirty days before\r\nthe festival, to undergo certain exercises in the Gymnasium at Elis,\r\nunder the superintendence of the Hellanodicae. The competitors took\r\ntheir places by lot. The herald then proclaimed the name and country\r\nof each competitor. When they were all ready to begin the contest,\r\nthe judges exhorted them to acquit themselves nobly, and then gave\r\nthe signal to commence.--The only prize given to the conqueror was\r\na garland of wild olive (κότινος), cut from a sacred olive tree,\r\nwhich grew in the sacred grove of Altis in Olympia. The victor was\r\noriginally crowned upon a tripod covered over with bronze, but\r\nafterwards upon a table made of ivory and gold. Palm branches, the\r\ncommon tokens of victory on other occasions, were placed in his\r\nhands. The name of the victor, and that of his father and of his\r\ncountry, were then proclaimed by a herald before the representatives\r\nof assembled Greece. The festival ended with processions and\r\nsacrifices, and with a public banquet given by the Eleans to the\r\nconquerors in the Prytaneium. The most powerful states considered an\r\nOlympic victory, gained by one of their citizens, to confer honour\r\nupon the state to which he belonged; and a conqueror usually had\r\nimmunities and privileges conferred upon him by the gratitude of\r\nhis fellow-citizens. On his return home the victor entered the city\r\nin a triumphal procession, in which his praises were celebrated,\r\nfrequently in the loftiest strains of poetry. [ATHLETAE.] As persons\r\nfrom all parts of the Hellenic world were assembled together at the\r\nOlympic Games, it was the best opportunity which the artist and the\r\nwriter possessed of making their works known. It answered, to some\r\nextent, the same purpose as the press does in modern times. Before\r\nthe invention of printing, the reading of an author’s works to as\r\nlarge an assembly as could be obtained, was one of the easiest and\r\nsurest modes of publishing them; and this was a favourite practice of\r\nthe Greeks and Romans. Accordingly we find many instances of literary\r\nworks thus published at the Olympic festival. Herodotus is said to\r\nhave read his history at this festival; but though there are some\r\nreasons for doubting the correctness of this statement, there are\r\nnumerous other writers who thus published their works, as the sophist\r\nHippias, Prodicus of Ceos, Anaximenes, the orator Lysias, Dion\r\nChrysostom, &c. It must be borne in mind that these recitations were\r\nnot contests, and that they formed properly no part of the festival.\r\nIn the same way painters and other artists exhibited their works at\r\nOlympia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLYMPĬAS (ὀλυμπιάς), an Olympiad, the most celebrated chronological\r\naera among the Greeks, was the period of four years which elapsed\r\nbetween each celebration of the Olympic Games. The Olympiads began\r\nto be reckoned from the victory of Coroebus in the foot-race, which\r\nhappened in the year B.C. 776. Timaeus of Sicily, however, who\r\nflourished B.C. 264, was the first writer who regularly arranged\r\nevents according to the conquerors in each Olympiad. His practice\r\nof recording events by Olympiads was followed by Polybius, Diodorus\r\nSiculus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, &c. The writers who make use of\r\nthe aera of the Olympiads, usually give the number of the Olympiad\r\n(the first corresponding to B.C. 776), and then the name of the\r\nconqueror in the foot-race. Some writers also speak of events as\r\nhappening in the first, second, third, or fourth year, as the case\r\nmay be, of a certain Olympiad; but others do not give the separate\r\nyears of each Olympiad. The rules for converting Olympiads into the\r\nyear B.C., and _vice versa_, are given under CHRONOLOGIA; but as this\r\nis troublesome, the student will find at the end of the book a list\r\nof the Olympiads, with the years of the Christian aera corresponding\r\nto them from the beginning of the Olympiads to A.D. 301. To save\r\nspace, the separate years of each Olympiad, with the corresponding\r\nyears B.C., are only given from the 47th to the 126th Olympiad, as\r\nthis is the most important period of Grecian history; in the other\r\nOlympiads the first year only is given. In consulting the table it\r\nmust be borne in mind that the Olympic Games were celebrated about\r\nmidsummer, and that the Attic year commenced at about the same time.\r\nIf, therefore, an event happened in the second half of the Attic\r\nyear, the year B.C. must be reduced by 1. Thus Socrates was put to\r\ndeath in the 1st year of the 95th Olympiad, which corresponds in the\r\ntable to B.C. 400; but as his death happened in Thargelion, the 11th\r\nmonth of the Attic year, the year B.C. must be reduced by 1, which\r\ngives us B.C. 399, the true date of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nŎPĀLĬA, a Roman festival in honour of Opis, celebrated on the 19th of\r\nDecember, being the third day of the Saturnalia. It was believed that\r\nOpis was the wife of Saturnus, and for this reason the festivals were\r\ncelebrated at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPSŌNĬUM, or OBSŌNĬUM (ὄψον, _dim._ ὀψάριον; ὀψήμα), denoted\r\neverything which was eaten with bread, the principal substance of\r\nevery meal. Those numerous articles of diet called _opsonia_ or\r\n_pulmentaria_ were designed to give nutriment, but still more to\r\nadd a relish to food. Some of these articles were taken from the\r\nvegetable kingdom, but were much more pungent and savoury than bread,\r\nsuch as olives, either fresh or pickled, radishes, and sesamum. Of\r\nanimal food by much the most common kind was fish, whence the terms\r\nunder explanation were in the course of time used in a confined and\r\nspecial sense to denote fish only, but fish variously prepared, and\r\nmore especially salt fish, which was most extensively employed to\r\ngive a relish to the vegetable diet. The Athenians were in the habit\r\nof going to markets (εἰς τοῦψον) themselves in order to purchase\r\ntheir opsonia (ὀψωνεῖν, _opsonare_). But the opulent, Romans had a\r\nslave, called _opsonator_ (ὀψώνης), whose office it was to purchase\r\nfor his master.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTĬO. [CENTURIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTĬMĀTES. [NOBILES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nŌRĀCŬLUM (μαντεῖον, χρηστήριον) was used by the ancients to designate\r\nboth the revelations made by the deity to man, as well as the place\r\nin which such revelations were made. The deity was in none of these\r\nplaces believed to appear in person to man, and to communicate to him\r\nhis will or knowledge of the future, but all oracular revelations\r\nwere made through some kind of medium, which was different in the\r\ndifferent places where oracles existed. It may, at first sight, seem\r\nstrange that there were, comparatively speaking, so few oracles of\r\nZeus, the father and ruler of gods and men. But although, according\r\nto the belief of the ancients, Zeus himself was the first source\r\nof all oracular revelations, yet he was too far above men to enter\r\nwith them into any close relation; other gods therefore, especially\r\nApollo, and even heroes, acted as mediators between Zeus and men,\r\nand were, as it were, the organs through which he communicated his\r\nwill. The ancients consulted the will of the gods on all important\r\noccasions of public and private life, since they were unwilling to\r\nundertake anything of importance without their sanction.--The most\r\ncelebrated oracle was that of Apollo at Delphi. Its ancient name was\r\nPytho. In the centre of the temple there was a small opening (χάσμα)\r\nin the ground, from which, from time to time, an intoxicating smoke\r\narose, which was believed to come from the well of Cassotis, which\r\nvanished into the ground close by the sanctuary. Over this chasm\r\nthere stood a high tripod, on which the Pythia, led into the temple\r\nby the prophetes (προφήτης), took her seat whenever the oracle was\r\nto be consulted. The smoke rising from under the tripod affected\r\nher brain in such a manner that she fell into a state of delirious\r\nintoxication, and the sounds which she uttered in this state were\r\nbelieved to contain the revelations of Apollo. These sounds were\r\ncarefully written down by the prophetes, and afterwards communicated\r\nto the persons who had come to consult the oracle. The Pythia (the\r\nπροφῆτις) was always a native of Delphi, and when she had once\r\nentered the service of the god she never left it, and was never\r\nallowed to marry. In early times she was always a young girl, but\r\nsubsequently no one was elected as prophetess who had not attained\r\nthe age of fifty years. The Delphians, or, more properly speaking,\r\nthe noble families of Delphi, had the superintendence of the oracle.\r\nAmong the Delphian aristocracy, however, there were five families\r\nwhich traced their origin to Deucalion, and from each of these one of\r\nthe five priests, called _Hosioi_ (ὅσιοι), was taken. The _Hosioi_,\r\ntogether with the high-priest or prophetes, held their offices for\r\nlife, and had the control of all the affairs of the sanctuary and of\r\nthe sacrifices. That these noble families had an immense influence\r\nupon the oracle is manifest from numerous instances, and it is not\r\nimprobable that they were its very soul, and that it was they who\r\ndictated the pretended revelations of the god. Most of the oracular\r\nanswers which are extant are in hexameters, and in the Ionic dialect.\r\nSometimes, however, Doric forms also were used.--No religious\r\ninstitution in all antiquity obtained such a paramount influence in\r\nGreece as the oracle of Delphi. When consulted on a subject of a\r\nreligious nature, the answer was invariably of a kind calculated not\r\nonly to protect and preserve religious institutions, but to command\r\nnew ones to be established, so that it was the preserver and promoter\r\nof religion throughout the ancient world. Colonies were seldom or\r\nnever founded without having obtained the advice and the directions\r\nof the Delphic god. The Delphic oracle had at all times a leaning in\r\nfavour of the Greeks of the Doric race, but the time when it began\r\nto lose its influence must be dated from the period when Athens and\r\nSparta entered upon their struggle for the supremacy in Greece; for\r\nat this time the partiality for Sparta became so manifest that the\r\nAthenians and their party began to lose all reverence and esteem\r\nfor it, and the oracle became a mere instrument in the hands of a\r\npolitical party. Of the other oracles, the most celebrated were that\r\nof Apollo at Didyma, usually called the oracle of the Branchidae, in\r\nthe territory of Miletus; that of Zeus, at Dodona, where the oracle\r\nwas given from sounds produced by the wind; that of Zeus Ammon, in\r\nan oasis in Libya, not far from the boundaries of Egypt; that of\r\nAmphiaraus, between Potniae and Thebes, where the hero was said to\r\nhave been swallowed up by the earth; and that of Trophonius, at\r\nLebadeia in Boeotia.\r\n\r\n\r\nŌRĀRĬUM was a small handkerchief used for wiping the face, and\r\nappears to have been employed for much the same purposes as our\r\npocket-handkerchief. It was made of silk or linen. Aurelian\r\nintroduced the practice of giving _Oraria_ to the Roman people to use\r\n_ad favorem_, which appears to mean for the purpose of waving in the\r\npublic games in token of applause.\r\n\r\n\r\nŌRĀTOR. The profession of the Roman orator, who with reference to\r\nhis undertaking a client’s case is also called patronus, was quite\r\ndistinct from that of the Jurisconsultus [JURISCONSULTI], and also\r\nfrom that of the Advocatus, at least in the time of Cicero, and even\r\nlater. An orator who possessed a competent knowledge of the Jus\r\nCivile would, however, have an advantage. Some requisites of oratory,\r\nsuch as voice and gesture, could only be acquired by discipline,\r\nwhereas a competent knowledge of the law of a case (_juris utilitas_)\r\ncould be got at any time from the jurisconsulti (_periti_) or from\r\nbooks. Oratory was a serious study among the Romans. Cicero tells\r\nus by what painful labour he attained to excellence. Roman oratory\r\nreached its perfection in the century which preceded the Christian\r\naera. Its decline dates from the establishment of the Imperial power.\r\nThe old orators learned their art by constant attendance on some\r\neminent orator and by actual experience of business: the orators of\r\nMessala’s time were formed in the schools of Rhetoric, and their\r\npowers were developed in exercises on fictitious matters. But the\r\nimmediate causes of the former nourishing condition of eloquence\r\nwere the political power which oratory conferred on the orator under\r\nthe Republic, and the party struggles and even the violence that are\r\nincident to such a state of society.\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHESTRA. [THEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORCĪNUS SĔNĀTOR. [SENATUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDO is applied to any body of men who form a distinct class in\r\nthe community, either by possessing distinct privileges, pursuing\r\ncertain trades or professions, or in any other way. Thus the whole\r\nbody of sacerdotes at Rome is spoken of as an ordo, and separate\r\necclesiastical corporations are called by the same title. The\r\nlibertini and scribae also formed separate ordines. The senate and\r\nthe equites are also spoken of respectively as the ordo senatorius\r\nand ordo equestris, but this name is never applied to the plebes.\r\nAccordingly we find the expression, _uterque ordo_, used without\r\nany further explanation to designate the senatorial and equestrian\r\nordines. The senatorial ordo, as the highest, is sometimes\r\ndistinguished as _amplissimus ordo_.--The senate in colonies and\r\nmunicipia was called _ordo decurionum_ [COLONIA], and sometimes\r\nsimply _ordo_.--The term ordo is also applied to a company or troop\r\nof soldiers, and is used as equivalent to centuria: thus centurions\r\nare sometimes called _qui ordines duxerunt_, and the first centuries\r\nin a legion _primi ordines_. Even the centurions of the first\r\ncenturies are occasionally called _primi ordines_.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGIA. [MYSTERIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORGYIA (ὀργυιά), a Greek measure of length, derived from the\r\nhuman body, was the distance from extremity to extremity of the\r\noutstretched arms, whence the name, from ὀρέγω. It was equal to 6\r\nfeet or to 4 cubits, and was 1-100th of the stadium.\r\n\r\n\r\nŎRĬCHALCUM, a metallic compound, akin to copper and bronze, which\r\nwas highly prized by the ancients. It probably denotes _brass_, with\r\nwhich the ancients became acquainted by fusing zinc ore (_cadmium_,\r\ncalamine) with copper, although they appear to have had scarcely\r\nany knowledge of zinc as a metal. The word is derived from ὄρος and\r\nχαλκός, that is, _mountain-bronze_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSCHOPHŎRIA (ὠσχοφόρια, ὀσχοφόρια), an Attic festival, which,\r\naccording to some writers, was celebrated in honour of Athena and\r\nDionysus, and according to others in honour of Dionysus and Ariadne.\r\nIt is said to have been instituted by Theseus. It was a vintage\r\nfestival, and its name is derived from ὦσχος, ὄσχος, or ὄσχη, a\r\nbranch of vines with grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oscillum. (From a Marble in the British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nOSCILLUM, a diminutive through _osculum_ from _os_, meaning “a little\r\nface,” was the term applied to faces or heads of Bacchus, which\r\nwere suspended in the vineyards to be turned in every direction\r\nby the wind. Whichsoever way they looked, they were supposed to\r\nmake the vines in that quarter fruitful. The first cut represents\r\nthe countenance of Bacchus with a beautiful, mild, and propitious\r\nexpression. The other cut represents a tree with four oscilla hung\r\nupon its branches. A syrinx and a pedum are placed at the root of the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oscillum. (From an ancient Gem.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTĬĀRĬUM, a tax upon the doors of houses, which appears to have been\r\nsometimes levied in the provinces. There was a similar tax, called\r\n_columnarium_, imposed upon every pillar that supported a house.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTĬUM. [JANUA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nŎVĀTĬO, a lesser triumph. The circumstances by which it was\r\ndistinguished from the more imposing solemnity [TRIUMPHUS] were the\r\nfollowing:--The general did not enter the city in a chariot drawn\r\nby four horses, but on foot: he was not arrayed in the gorgeous\r\ngold-embroidered robe, but in the simple toga praetexta of a\r\nmagistrate; his brows were encircled with a wreath, not of laurel\r\nbut of myrtle; he bore no sceptre in his hand; the procession was\r\nnot heralded by trumpets, headed by the senate, and thronged with\r\nvictorious troops, but was enlivened by a crowd of flute players,\r\nattended chiefly by knights and plebeians, frequently without\r\nsoldiers: the ceremonies were concluded by the sacrifice, not of a\r\nbull but of a sheep. The word _ovatio_ seems clearly to be derived\r\nfrom the kind of victim offered. An ovation was granted when the\r\nadvantage gained, although considerable, was not sufficient to\r\nconstitute a legitimate claim to the higher distinction of a triumph,\r\nor when the victory had been achieved with little bloodshed; or when\r\nhostilities had not been regularly proclaimed; or when the war had\r\nnot been completely terminated; or when the contest had been carried\r\non against base and unworthy foes; and hence when the servile bands\r\nof Athenion and Spartacus were destroyed by Perperna and Crassus,\r\nthese leaders celebrated ovations only.\r\n\r\n\r\nŎVĪLE. [COMITIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAEAN (παιήων, παιάν, παιών), a hymn or song, which was originally\r\nsung in honour of Apollo. It was always of a joyous nature, and\r\nits tune and sounds expressed hope and confidence. It was a song\r\nof thanksgiving, when danger was passed, and also a hymn to\r\npropitiate the god. It was sung at the solemn festivals of Apollo,\r\nand especially at the Hyacinthia. The paean was also sung as a\r\nbattle-song, both before an attack on the enemy and after the battle\r\nwas finished. It is certain that the paean was in later times sung to\r\nthe honour of other gods besides Apollo. Thus Xenophon relates that\r\nthe Greek army in Asia sung a paean to Zeus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAEDĂGŌGUS (παιδαγωγός), a tutor. The office of tutor in a Grecian\r\nfamily of rank and opulence was assigned to one of the most\r\ntrustworthy of the slaves. The sons of his master were committed to\r\nhis care on attaining their sixth or seventh year, their previous\r\neducation having been conducted by females. They remained with the\r\ntutor until they attained the age of puberty. His duty was rather to\r\nguard them from evil, both physical and moral, than to communicate\r\ninstruction. He went with them to and from the school or the\r\nGYMNASIUM; he accompanied them out of doors on all occasions; he was\r\nresponsible for their personal safety, and for their avoidance of bad\r\ncompany. In the Roman empire the name _paedagogi_ or _paedagogia_\r\nwas given to beautiful young slaves, who discharged in the imperial\r\npalace the duties of the modern _page_, which is in fact a corruption\r\nof the ancient name.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAEDŎNŎMUS (παιδονόμος), a magistrate at Sparta, who had the general\r\nsuperintendence of the education of the boys.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAENŬLA, a thick cloak, chiefly used by the Romans in travelling,\r\ninstead of the toga, as a protection against the cold and rain. It\r\nappears to have had no sleeves, and only an opening for the head, as\r\nshown in the following figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paenula, travelling cloak. (From Bartholini.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĀGĀNĀLĬA. [PAGI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĀGĀNI. [PAGI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĀGI were fortified places in the neighbourhood of Rome, to which\r\nthe country-people might retreat in case of a hostile inroad. Each\r\nof the country tribes is said to have been divided by Numa into a\r\ncertain number of pagi; which name was given to the country adjoining\r\nthe fortified village, as well as to the village itself. There was\r\na magistrate at the head of each pagus, who kept a register of the\r\nnames and of the property of all persons in the pagus, raised the\r\ntaxes, and summoned the people, when necessary, to war. Each pagus\r\nhad its own sacred rites, and an annual festival called _Paganalia_.\r\nThe _pagani_, or inhabitants of the pagi, had their regular meetings,\r\nat which they passed resolutions. The division of the country-people\r\ninto pagi continued to the latest times of the Roman empire. The term\r\nPagani is often used in opposition to milites, and is applied to all\r\nwho were not soldiers, even though they did not live in the country.\r\nThe Christian writers gave the name of pagani to those persons who\r\nadhered to the old Roman religion, because the latter continued to be\r\ngenerally believed by the country-people, after Christianity became\r\nthe prevailing religion of the inhabitants of the towns.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂLAESTRA (παλαίστρα), properly means a place for wrestling\r\n(παλαίειν, πάλη), and appears to have originally formed a part of\r\nthe gymnasium. At Athens, however, there was a considerable number\r\nof palaestrae, quite distinct from the gymnasia. It appears most\r\nprobable that the palaestrae were chiefly appropriated to the\r\nexercises of wrestling and of the pancratium, and were principally\r\nintended for the athletae, who, it must be recollected, were persons\r\nthat contended in the public games, and therefore needed special\r\ntraining. The Romans had originally no places corresponding to the\r\nGreek gymnasia and palaestrae; and when towards the close of the\r\nrepublic wealthy Romans, in imitation of the Greeks, began to build\r\nplaces for exercise in their villas, they called them indifferently\r\ngymnasia and palaestrae.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂLĪLIA, a festival celebrated at Rome every year on the 21st of\r\nApril, in honour of Pales, the tutelary divinity of shepherds. The\r\n21st of April was the day on which, according to the early traditions\r\nof Rome, Romulus had commenced the building of the city, so that\r\nthe festival was at the same time solemnised as the dies natalitius\r\nof Rome. It was originally a shepherd-festival, and continued to\r\nbe so among country people till the latest times, but in the city\r\nit lost its original character, and was only regarded as the dies\r\nnatalitius of Rome. The first part of the solemnities was a public\r\npurification by fire and smoke. The things burnt in order to produce\r\nthis purifying smoke were the blood of the _October-horse_, the ashes\r\nof the calves sacrificed at the festival of Ceres, and the shells of\r\nbeans. The people were also sprinkled with water, they washed their\r\nhands in spring-water, and drank milk mixed with must. As regards the\r\n_October-horse_ (_equus October_) it must be observed that in early\r\ntimes no bloody sacrifice was allowed to be offered at the palilia,\r\nand the blood of the October-horse mentioned above, was the blood\r\nwhich had dropped from the tail of the horse sacrificed in the month\r\nof October to Mars in the Campus Martius. This blood was preserved by\r\nthe vestal virgins in the temple of Vesta for the purpose of being\r\nused at the palilia. The sacrifices consisted of cakes, millet, milk,\r\nand other kinds of eatables. The shepherds then offered a prayer to\r\nPales. After these solemn rites were over, the cheerful part of the\r\nfestival began: bonfires were made of heaps of hay and straw, and\r\nthe festival was concluded by a feast in the open air, at which the\r\npeople sat or lay upon benches of turf, and drank plentifully.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALLĬUM, _dim._ PALLIŎLUM, _poet._ PALLA (ἱμάτιον, _dim._ ἱματίδιον;\r\n_Ion._ and _poet._ φᾶρος), an outer garment. The English _cloak_,\r\nthough commonly adopted as the translation of these terms, conveys\r\nno accurate conception of the form, material, or use of that which\r\nthey denoted. The article designated by them was always a rectangular\r\npiece of cloth, exactly, or at least nearly square. It was indeed\r\nused in the very form in which it was taken from the loom, being made\r\nentirely by the weaver, without any aid from the tailor, except to\r\nrepair the injuries which it sustained by time. Whatever additional\r\nrichness and beauty it received from the art of the dyer, was\r\nbestowed upon it before its materials were woven into cloth or even\r\nspun into thread. Most commonly it was used without having undergone\r\nany process of this kind. The raw material, such as wool, flax, or\r\ncotton, was manufactured in its natural state, and hence pallia were\r\ncommonly white, although from the same cause brown, drab, and grey\r\nwere also prevailing colours. As the pallium was the most common\r\nouter garment, we find it continually mentioned in conjunction with\r\nthe tunica, which constituted the indutus. Such phrases as “coat and\r\nwaistcoat,” or “shoes and stockings,” are not more common with us\r\nthan the following expressions, which constantly occur in ancient\r\nauthors: _tunica palliumque_, ἱμάτιον καὶ χιτών, τὸ ἱμάτιον καὶ ὁ\r\nχιτωνίσκος, φᾶρος ἠδὲ χιτών, &c. To wear the pallium without the\r\nunderclothing indicated poverty or severity of manners, as in the\r\ncase of Socrates. One of the most common modes of wearing the pallium\r\nwas to fasten it with a brooch over the right shoulder, leaving the\r\nright arm at liberty, and to pass the middle of it either under the\r\nleft arm so as to leave that arm at liberty also, or over the left\r\nshoulder so as to cover the left arm. The figure in the preceding cut\r\nis attired in the last-mentioned fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pallium. (Museo Pio-Clement., vol. i. tav. 48.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPALMA. [PES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPALMĬPES, a Roman measure of length, equal to a foot and a palm.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALMUS, properly the width of the open hand, or, more exactly, of the\r\nfour fingers, was used by the Romans for two different measures of\r\nlength, namely, as the translation of the Greek παλαιστή, or δῶρον in\r\nold Greek, and σπιθαμή respectively. In the former sense it is equal\r\nto 4 digits, or 3 inches, or 1-4th of a foot, or 1-6th of the cubit.\r\nThe larger palm of 9 inches only occurs in later Roman writers. From\r\nthis large _palmus_ the modern Roman _palmo_ is derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paludamentum, Military Cloak. (Statue of a Roman\r\nEmperor.)]\r\n\r\nPĂLŪDĀMENTUM, the cloak worn by a Roman general commanding an army,\r\nhis principal officers and personal attendants, in contradistinction\r\nto the _sagum_ of the common soldiers, and the _toga_ or garb of\r\npeace. It was the practice for a Roman magistrate, after he had\r\nreceived the _imperium_ from the comitia curiata and offered up\r\nhis vows in the Capitol, to march out of the city arrayed in the\r\npaludamentum (_exire paludatus_), attended by his lictors in similar\r\nattire (_paludatis lictoribus_), nor could he again enter the gates\r\nuntil he had formally divested himself of this emblem of military\r\npower. The paludamentum was open in front, reached down to the\r\nknees or a little lower, and hung loosely over the shoulders, being\r\nfastened across the chest by a clasp. The colour of the paludamentum\r\nwas commonly white or purple, and hence it was marked and remembered\r\nthat Crassus on the morning of the fatal battle of Carrhae went forth\r\nin a dark-coloured mantle. In the cut below, representing the head of\r\na warrior, we see the paludamentum flying back in the charge, and the\r\nclasp nearly in front.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paludamentum, Military Cloak. (From a Mosaic at\r\nPompeii.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPAMBOEŌTĬA (παμβοιώτια), a festive panegyris of all the Boeotians,\r\nlike the Panathenaea of the Atticans, and the Panionia of the\r\nIonians. The principal object of the meeting was the common worship\r\nof Athena Itonia, who had a temple in the neighbourhood of Coronea,\r\nnear which the panegyris was held.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂNĂTHĒNAEA (παναθήναια), the greatest and most splendid of the\r\nfestivals celebrated in Attica in honour of Athena, in the character\r\nof Athena Polias, or the protectress of the city. It was said to\r\nhave been instituted by Erichthonius, and its original name, down\r\nto the time of Theseus, was believed to have been Athenaea; but\r\nwhen Theseus united all the Atticans into one body, this festival,\r\nwhich then became the common festival of all the Attic tribes,\r\nwas called Panathenaea. There were two kinds of Panathenaea, the\r\ngreater and the lesser; the former were held every fourth year\r\n(πενταετηρίς), the latter every year. The lesser Panathenaea were\r\nprobably celebrated on the 17th of the month Hecatombaeon; the\r\ngreat Panathenaea in the third year of every Olympiad, and probably\r\ncommenced on the same day as the lesser Panathenaea. The principal\r\ndifference between the two festivals was, that the greater one was\r\nmore solemn, and that on this occasion the peplus of Athena was\r\ncarried to her temple in a most magnificent procession, which was\r\nnot held at the lesser Panathenaea. The solemnities, games, and\r\namusements of the Panathenaea were, rich sacrifices of bulls, foot,\r\nhorse, and chariot races, gymnastic and musical contests, and the\r\nlampadephoria; rhapsodists recited the poems of Homer and other epic\r\npoets, philosophers disputed, cock-fights were exhibited, and the\r\npeople indulged in a variety of other amusements and entertainments.\r\nThe prize in these contests was a vase filled with oil from the\r\nancient and sacred olive tree of Athena on the Acropolis. A great\r\nmany of such vases, called Panathenaic vases, have in late years\r\nbeen found in Etruria, southern Italy, Sicily, and Greece. They\r\nrepresent on one side the figure of Athena, and on the other the\r\nvarious contests and games in which these vases were given as prizes\r\nto the victors. Of the discussions of philosophers and orators at the\r\nPanathenaea we still possess two specimens, the λόγος Παναθηναικός of\r\nIsocrates, and that of Aristeides. Herodotus is said to have recited\r\nhis history to the Athenians at the Panathenaea. The management of\r\nthe games and contests was entrusted to persons called _Athlothetae_\r\n(ἀθλοθέται), whose number was ten, one being taken from every tribe.\r\nTheir office lasted from one great Panathenaic festival to the other.\r\nThe chief solemnity of the great Panathenaea was the magnificent\r\nprocession to the temple of Athena Polias, which probably took place\r\non the last day of the festive season. The whole of the procession\r\nis represented in the frieze of the Parthenon, the work of Phidias\r\nand his disciples, now deposited in the British Museum. The chief\r\nobject of the procession was to carry the peplus of the goddess\r\nto her temple. This peplus was a crocus-coloured garment for the\r\ngoddess, and made by maidens, called ἐργαστῖναι. In it were woven\r\nEnceladus and the giants, as they were conquered by the goddess. The\r\npeplus was not carried to the temple by men, but suspended from the\r\nmast of a ship. The procession proceeded from the Ceramicus, near a\r\nmonument called Leocorium, to the temple of Demeter at Eleusis, and\r\nthence along the Pelasgic wall and the temple of Apollo Pythius to\r\nthe Pnyx, and thence to the Acropolis, where the statue of Minerva\r\nPolias was adorned with the peplus. In this procession nearly the\r\nwhole population of Attica appears to have taken part, either on\r\nfoot, on horseback, or in chariots, as may be seen in the frieze\r\nof the Parthenon. Aged men carried olive branches, and were called\r\n_Thallophori_ (θαλλοφόροι); young men attended, at least in earlier\r\ntimes, in armour, and maidens who belonged to the noblest families of\r\nAthens carried baskets, containing offerings for the goddess, whence\r\nthey were called _Canephori_ (κανηφόροι). Respecting the part which\r\naliens took in this procession, and the duties they had to perform,\r\nsee HYDRIAPHORIA. Men who had deserved well of the republic were\r\nrewarded with a gold crown at the great Panathenaea, and the herald\r\nhad to announce the event during the gymnastic contests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pancratiastae. (Krause, Gymnastik und Agonistik der\r\nHellen, tav. 21.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPANCRĂTĬUM (παγκράτιον), is derived from πάν and κράτος, and\r\naccordingly signifies an athletic game, in which all the powers of\r\nthe fighter were called into action. The pancratium was one of the\r\ngames or gymnastic contests which were exhibited at all the great\r\nfestivals of Greece; it consisted of boxing and wrestling (πυγμή and\r\nπάλη), and was reckoned to be one of the heavy or hard exercises\r\n(ἀγωνίσματα βαρέα or βαρύτερα), on account of the violent exertions\r\nit required, and for this reason it was not much practised in the\r\ngymnasia. In Homer we find neither the game nor the name of the\r\npancratium mentioned, and as it was not introduced at the Olympic\r\ngames until Ol. 33, we may presume that the game, though it may\r\nhave existed long before in a rude state, was not brought to any\r\ndegree of perfection until a short time before that event. The name\r\nof the combatants was _Pancratiastae_ (παγκρατιασταί) or _Pammachi_\r\n(πάμμαχοι). They fought naked, and had their bodies anointed and\r\ncovered with sand, by which they were enabled to take hold of one\r\nanother. When the contest began, each of the fighters might commence\r\nby boxing or by wrestling, accordingly as he thought he should be\r\nmore successful in the one than in the other. The victory was not\r\ndecided until one of the parties was killed, or lifted up a finger,\r\nthereby declaring that he was unable to continue the contest either\r\nfrom pain or fatigue.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂNĒGỸRIS (πανήγυρις), signifies a meeting or assembly of a whole\r\npeople for the purpose of worshipping at a common sanctuary. The word\r\nis used in three significations:--1. For a meeting of the inhabitants\r\nof one particular town and its vicinity; 2. For a meeting of the\r\ninhabitants of a whole district, a province, or of the whole body\r\nof people belonging to a particular tribe [DELIA; PANIONIA]; and 3.\r\nFor great national meetings, as the Olympic, Pythian, Isthmian, and\r\nNemean games. Although in all panegyreis which we know, the religious\r\ncharacter forms the most prominent feature, other subjects, political\r\ndiscussions and resolutions, as well as a variety of amusements,\r\nwere not excluded, though they were perhaps more a consequence of\r\nthe presence of many persons than objects of the meeting. Every\r\npanegyris, moreover, was made by tradespeople a source of gain, and\r\nit may be presumed that such a meeting was never held without a fair,\r\nat which all sorts of things were exhibited for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂNIŌNĬA (πανιώνια), the great national panegyris of the Ionians on\r\nmount Mycalé, where the national god Poseidon Heliconius had his\r\nsanctuary called the Panionium. One of the principal objects of this\r\nnational meeting was the common worship of Poseidon, to whom splendid\r\nsacrifices were offered on the occasion. But religious worship was\r\nnot the only object for which they assembled at the Panionium; on\r\ncertain emergencies, especially in case of any danger threatening\r\ntheir country, the Ionians discussed at their meetings political\r\nquestions, and passed resolutions which were binding upon all.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂNOPLĬA (πανοπλία), a panoply or suit of armour. The articles of\r\nwhich it consisted both in the Greek and in the Roman army, are\r\nenumerated under ARMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPANTŎMĪMUS, the name of a kind of actors peculiar to the Romans, who\r\nvery nearly resembled in their mode of acting the modern dancers in\r\nthe ballet. They did not speak on the stage, but merely acted by\r\ngestures, movements, and attitudes. All movements, however, were\r\nrhythmical like those in the ballet, whence the general term for them\r\nis _saltatio_, _saltare_; the whole art was called _musica muta_;\r\nand to represent Niobe or Leda was expressed by _saltare Nioben_ and\r\n_saltare Ledam_. During the time of the republic the name pantomimus\r\ndoes not occur, though the art itself was known to the Romans at an\r\nearly period; for the first histriones said to have been introduced\r\nfrom Etruria were in fact nothing but pantomimic dancers [HISTRIO],\r\nwhence we find that under the empire the names histrio and pantomimus\r\nwere used as synonymous. The pantomimic art, however, was not carried\r\nto any degree of perfection until the time of Augustus. The greatest\r\npantomimes of this time were Bathyllus, a freedman and favourite\r\nof Maecenas, and Pylades and Hylas. Mythological love-stories were\r\nfrom the first the favourite subjects of the pantomimes, which were\r\ndisgraced by the most licentious scenes. In Sicily pantomimic dances\r\nwere called _ballismi_ (βαλλισμοί), whence perhaps the modern words\r\nball and ballet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂPȲRUS. [LIBER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĂDĪSUS (παράδεισος), the name given by the Greeks to the parks\r\nor pleasure-grounds, which surrounded the country residences of the\r\nPersian kings and satraps. They were generally stocked with animals\r\nfor the chase, were full of all kinds of trees, watered by numerous\r\nstreams, and enclosed with walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĂGRĂPHĒ (παραγραφή). This word does not exactly correspond with\r\nany term in our language, but may without much impropriety be\r\ncalled _a plea_. It is an objection raised by the defendant to the\r\nadmissibility of the plaintiff’s action. The _paragraphé_, like every\r\nother answer (ἀντιγραφή) made by the defendant to the plaintiff’s\r\ncharge, was given in writing; as the word itself implies. If the\r\ndefendant merely denied the plaintiff’s allegations, a court was\r\nat once held for the trial of the cause. If, however, he put in a\r\n_paragraphé_, a court was to be held to try the preliminary question,\r\nwhether the cause could be brought into court or not. Upon this\r\nprevious trial the defendant was considered the _actor_. If he\r\nsucceeded, the whole cause was at an end; unless the objection was\r\nonly to the form of action, or some other such technicality, in which\r\ncase it might be recommenced in the proper manner. If, however, the\r\nplaintiff succeeded, the original action, which in the mean time had\r\nbeen suspended, was proceeded with.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĂLUS (πάραλος), and SĂLAMĪNĬA (σαλαμινία). The Athenians from very\r\nearly times kept for public purposes two sacred or state vessels,\r\nthe one of which was called _Paralus_ and the other _Salaminia_:\r\nthe crew of the one bore the name of παραλῖται or πάραλοι, and that\r\nof the other σαλαμίνιοι. The Salaminia was also called Δηλία or\r\nΘεωρίς, because it was used to convey the θεωροὶ to Delos, on which\r\noccasion the ship was adorned with garlands by the priest of Apollo.\r\nBoth these vessels were quick-sailing triremes, and were used for a\r\nvariety of state purposes: they conveyed theories, despatches, &c.\r\nfrom Athens, carried treasures from subject countries to Athens,\r\nfetched state criminals from foreign parts to Athens, and the like.\r\nIn battles they were frequently used as the ships in which the\r\nadmirals sailed. These vessels and their crews were always kept in\r\nreadiness to act, in case of any necessity arising; and the crew,\r\nalthough they could not for the greater part of the year be in\r\nactual service, received their regular pay of four oboli per day all\r\nthe year round. The names of the two ships seem to point to a very\r\nearly period of the history of Attica, when there was no navigation\r\nexcept between Attica and Salamis, for which the Salaminia was\r\nused, and around the coast of Attica, for which purpose the Paralus\r\nwas destined. In later times the names were retained, although the\r\ndestination of the ships was principally to serve the purposes of\r\nreligion, whence they are frequently called the sacred ships.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĂNOIĀS GRĂPHĒ (παρανοίας γραφή). This proceeding may be compared\r\nto our commission of lunacy, or writ _de lunatico inquirendo_. It\r\nwas a suit at Athens that might be instituted by a son or other\r\nrelation against one who, by reason of madness or mental imbecility,\r\nhad become incapable of managing his own affairs. If the complaint\r\nwas well grounded, the court decreed that the next heir should take\r\npossession of the lunatic’s property, and probably also made some\r\nprovision for his being put in confinement, or under proper care and\r\nguardianship. The celebrated tale of Iophon, the son of Sophocles,\r\naccusing his father of lunacy, is related in the life of Sophocles in\r\nthe _Classical Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĂNŎMŌN GRĂPHĒ (παρανόμων γραφή), an indictment at Athens for\r\npropounding an illegal, or rather unconstitutional measure or law.\r\nIn order to check rash and hasty legislation, the mover of any law\r\nor decree, though he succeeded in causing it to be passed, was\r\nstill amenable to criminal justice, if his enactment was found to\r\nbe inconsistent with other laws that remained in force, or with\r\nthe public interest. Any person might institute against him the\r\nγραφὴ παρανόμων within a year from the passing of the law. If he was\r\nconvicted, not only did the law become void, but any punishment\r\nmight be inflicted on him, at the discretion of the judges before\r\nwhom he was tried. A person thrice so convicted lost the right of\r\nproposing laws in future. The cognizance of the cause belonged to the\r\nThesmothetae.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRAPRESBEIA (παραπρεσβεία), signifies any corrupt conduct,\r\nmisfeasance, or neglect of duty on the part of an ambassador; for\r\nwhich he was liable to be called to account and prosecuted on his\r\nreturn home. Demosthenes accused Aeschines of _Parapresbeia_ on\r\naccount of his conduct in the embassy to Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĂPHERNA. [DOS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĂSANGA (ὁ παρασάγγης), a Persian measure of length, frequently\r\nmentioned by the Greek writers. It is still used by the Persians, who\r\ncall it _ferseng_. According to Herodotus the parasang was equal to\r\n30 Greek stadia. Xenophon must also have calculated it at the same,\r\nas he says that 16,050 stadia are equal to 535 parasangs. (16,050\r\n÷ 535 = 30.) Other ancient writers give a different length for the\r\nparasang. Modern English travellers estimate it variously at from\r\n3½ to 4 English miles, which nearly agrees with the calculation of\r\nHerodotus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĂSĪTI (παράσιτοι) properly denotes persons who dine with others.\r\nIn the early history of Greece the name had a very different\r\nmeaning, being given to distinguished persons, who were appointed as\r\nassistants to certain priests and to the highest magistrates. Their\r\nservices appear to have been rewarded with a third of the victims\r\nsacrificed to their respective gods. Such officers existed down to a\r\nlate period of Greek history. Solon in his legislation called the act\r\nof giving public meals to certain magistrates and foreign ambassadors\r\nin the prytaneum παρασιτεῖν, and it may be that the parasites were\r\nconnected with this institution. The class of persons whom we call\r\nparasites was very numerous in ancient Greece, and appears to have\r\nexisted from early times. The characteristic features common to all\r\nparasites are importunity, love of sensual pleasures, and above all\r\nthe desire of getting a good dinner without paying for it. During the\r\ntime of the Roman emperors a parasite seems to have been a constant\r\nguest at the tables of the wealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĔDRI (πάρεδροι). Each of the three superior archons was at liberty\r\nto have two assessors (πάρεδροι) chosen by himself, to assist him by\r\nadvice and otherwise in the performance of his various duties. The\r\nassessor, like the magistrate himself, had to undergo a _docimasia_\r\n(δοκιμασία) in the Senate of Five Hundred and before a judicial\r\ntribunal, before he could be permitted to enter upon his labours. He\r\nwas also to render an account (εὐθύνη) at the end of the year. The\r\nduties of the archons, magisterial and judicial, were so numerous,\r\nthat one of the principal objects of having assessors must have been\r\nto enable them to get through their business. From the _paredri_ of\r\nthe archons we must distinguish those who assisted the _euthyni_ in\r\nexamining and auditing magistrates’ accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRENTĀLĬA. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂRĬES. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARMA, _dim._ PARMŬLA, a round shield, three feet in diameter,\r\ncarried by the _velites_ in the Roman army. Though small, compared\r\nwith the CLIPEUS, it was so strongly made as to be a very effectual\r\nprotection. This was probably owing to the use of iron in its\r\nframe-work. The parma was also worn by the cavalry. We find the term\r\n_parma_ often applied to the target [CETRA], which was also a small\r\nround shield, and therefore very similar to the parma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parma. (From the Columna Trajana.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂROCHI, certain people paid by the state to supply the Roman\r\nmagistrates, ambassadors, and other official persons, when\r\ntravelling, with those necessaries which they could not conveniently\r\ncarry with them. They existed on all the principal stations on the\r\nRoman roads in Italy and the provinces, where persons were accustomed\r\nto pass the night. Of the things which the parochi were bound to\r\nsupply, hay, fire-wood, salt, and a certain number of beds appear to\r\nhave been the most important.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂROPSIS (παροψίς), any food eaten with the ὅψον as the μάζα, a kind\r\nof frumenty or soft cake, broth, or any kind of condiment or sauce.\r\nIt was, likewise, the name of the dish or plate, on which such food\r\nwas served up, and it is in this latter signification that the Roman\r\nwriters use the word.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARRĬCĪDA, PARRĬCĪDĬUM. A parricida signified originally a murderer\r\ngenerally, and is hence defined to be a person who kills another\r\n_dolo malo_. It afterwards signified the murderer of a parent, and by\r\nan ancient law such a parricide was sewed up in a sack (_culleus_),\r\nand thrown into a river. A law of the dictator Sulla contained some\r\nprovisions against parricide, and probably fixed the same punishment\r\nfor the parricide, as the Lex Pompeia de Parricidiis, passed in the\r\ntime of Cn. Pompeius. This law extended the crime of parricide to the\r\nkilling of a brother, sister, uncle, aunt, and many other relations,\r\nand enacted that he who killed a father or mother, grandfather or\r\ngrandmother, should be punished (_more majorum_) by being whipped\r\ntill he bled, sewed up in a sack with a dog, cock, viper, and ape,\r\nand thrown into the sea. Other parricides were simply put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSUS, a measure of length, which consisted of five Roman feet.\r\n[PES.] The passus was not the step, or distance from heel to heel,\r\nwhen the feet were at their utmost ordinary extension, but the\r\ndistance from the point which the heel leaves to that in which it is\r\nset down. The _mille passuum_, or thousand paces, was the common name\r\nof the Roman mile. [MILLIARE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTER FĂMĬLIAE. [FAMILIA; MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTER PĂTRĀTUS. [FETIALES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTĔRA, _dim._ PĂTELLA (φιάλη), a round plate or dish. The paterae\r\nof the most common kind were small plates of the common red\r\nearthenware, on which an ornamental pattern was drawn, and which were\r\nsometimes entirely black. The more valuable paterae were metallic,\r\nbeing chiefly of bronze; but every family, raised above poverty,\r\npossessed one of silver, together with a silver salt-cellar. The\r\naccompanying cut exhibits a highly ornamented patera, made of bronze.\r\nThe view of the upper surface is accompanied by a side-view, showing\r\nthe form and depth of the vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Patera. (From Pompeii.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTĬBŬLUM. [FURCA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTĬNA (λεκάνη), a basin or bowl of earthenware, rarely of bronze or\r\nsilver. The patina was of a form intermediate between the _patera_\r\nand the _olla_, not so flat as the former, nor so deep as the latter.\r\nThe most frequent use of the _patina_ was in cookery.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRES. [PATRICII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTRĬA POTESTAS. Potestas signifies generally a power or faculty of\r\nany kind by which we do anything. “Potestas,” says Paulus, a Roman\r\njurist, “has several significations: when applied to magistrates,\r\nit is Imperium; in the case of children, it is the patria potestas;\r\nin the case of slaves, it is Dominium.” According to Paulus then,\r\npotestas, as applied to magistrates, is equivalent to imperium.\r\nThus we find potestas associated with the adjectives praetoria,\r\nconsularis. But potestas is applied to magistrates who had not the\r\nimperium, as for instance to quaestors and tribuni plebis; and\r\npotestas and imperium are often opposed in Cicero. [IMPERIUM.] Thus\r\nit seems that this word potestas, like many other Roman terms,\r\nhad both a wider signification and a narrower one. In its wider\r\nsignification it might mean all the power that was delegated to any\r\nperson by the state, whatever might be the extent of that power.\r\nIn its narrower significations, it was on the one hand equivalent\r\nto imperium; and on the other, it expressed the power of those\r\nfunctionaries who had not the imperium. Sometimes it was used to\r\nexpress a magistratus, as a person; and hence in the Italian language\r\nthe word podestà signifies a magistrate. Potestas is also one of\r\nthe words by which is expressed the power that one private person\r\nhas over another, the other two being manus and mancipium. The\r\npotestas is either dominica, that is, ownership as exhibited in the\r\nrelation of master and slave [SERVUS]; or patria as exhibited in the\r\nrelation of father and child. The mancipium was framed after the\r\nanalogy of the potestas dominica. [MANCIPIUM.] Patria potestas then\r\nsignifies the power which a Roman father had over the persons of his\r\nchildren, grandchildren, and other descendants (_filii-familias_,\r\n_filiae-familias_), and generally all the rights which he had by\r\nvirtue of his paternity. The foundation of the patria potestas was\r\na legal marriage, and the birth of a child gave it full effect.\r\n[MATRIMONIUM.] It does not seem that the patria potestas was ever\r\nviewed among the Romans as absolutely equivalent to the dominica\r\npotestas, or as involving ownership of the child; and yet the\r\noriginal notion of the patria came very near to that of the dominica\r\npotestas. Originally the father had the power of life and death over\r\nhis son as a member of his familia; and he could sell him, and so\r\nbring him into the mancipii causa. He could also give his daughter in\r\nmarriage, or give a wife to his son, divorce his child, give him in\r\nadoption, and emancipate him at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRĬCĬI. This word is evidently a derivative from _pater_, which\r\nfrequently occurs in the Roman writers as equivalent to senator.\r\n_Patricii_ therefore signifies those who belonged to the _patres_,\r\nbut it is a mistake to suppose that the patricii were only the\r\noffspring of the patres in the sense of senators. On the contrary,\r\nthe patricians were, in the early history of Rome, the whole body\r\nof Roman citizens, the _populus Romanus_, and there were no real\r\ncitizens besides them. The other parts of the Roman population,\r\nnamely clients and slaves, did not belong to the populus Romanus,\r\nand were not burghers or patricians. The senators or patres (in\r\nthe narrower sense of the word) were a select body of the populus\r\nor patricians, which acted as their representatives. The burghers\r\nor patricians consisted originally of three distinct tribes, which\r\nafterwards became united into the sovereign populus. These tribes had\r\nfounded settlements upon several of the hills which were subsequently\r\nincluded within the precincts of the city of Rome. Their names were\r\nRamnes, Tities, and Luceres, or Ramnenses, Titienses, and Lucerenses.\r\nEach of these tribes consisted of ten curiae, and each curia of ten\r\ngentes, and of the same number of decuries, which were established\r\nfor representative and military purposes. [SENATUS.] The first\r\ntribe, or the Ramnes, were a Latin colony on the Palatine hill,\r\nsaid to have been founded by Romulus. As long as it stood alone, it\r\ncontained only one hundred gentes, and had a senate of one hundred\r\nmembers. When the Tities, or Sabine settlers on the Quirinal and\r\nViminal hills, under king Tatius, became united with the Ramnes,\r\nthe number of gentes, as well as that of senators, was increased\r\nto 200. These two tribes after their union continued probably for\r\na considerable time to be the patricians of Rome, until the third\r\ntribe, the Luceres, which chiefly consisted of Etruscans, who had\r\nsettled on the Caelian hill, also became united with the other two as\r\na third tribe. The amalgamation of these three tribes did not take\r\nplace at once: the union between Latins and Sabines is ascribed to\r\nthe reign of Romulus, though it does not appear to have been quite\r\nperfect, since the Latins on some occasions claimed a superiority\r\nover the Sabines. The Luceres existed for a long time as a separate\r\ntribe without enjoying the same rights as the two other tribes, until\r\nTarquinius Priscus, himself an Etruscan, caused them to be placed on\r\na footing of equality with the others. For this reason he is said to\r\nhave increased the number of senators to 300. The Luceres, however,\r\nare, notwithstanding this equalisation, sometimes distinguished\r\nfrom the other tribes by the name _patres_ or _patricii minorum\r\ngentium_. During the time of the republic, distinguished strangers\r\nand wealthy plebeians were occasionally made Roman patricians; for\r\ninstance, Appius Claudius and his gens, and Domitius Ahenobarbus.\r\nWhen the plebeians became a distinct class of citizens [PLEBES], the\r\npatricians, of course, ceased to be the only class of citizens, but\r\nthey still retained the exclusive possession of all the power in the\r\nstate. All civil and religious offices were in their possession, and\r\nthey continued as before to be the populus, the nation now consisting\r\nof the populus and the plebes. In their relation to the plebeians\r\nor the commonalty, the patricians were a real aristocracy of birth.\r\nA person born of a patrician family was and remained a patrician,\r\nwhether he was rich or poor, whether he was a member of the senate,\r\nor an eques, or held any of the great offices of the state, or not:\r\nthere was no power that could make a patrician a plebeian. As regards\r\nthe census, he might indeed not belong to the wealthy classes, but\r\nhis rank remained the same. The only way in which a patrician might\r\nbecome a plebeian was when of his own accord he left his gens and\r\ncuria, gave up the sacra, &c. A plebeian, on the other hand, or even\r\na stranger, might be made a patrician by a lex curiata. But this\r\nappears to have been done very seldom; and the consequence was, that\r\nin the course of a few centuries the number of patrician families\r\nbecame so rapidly diminished, that towards the close of the republic\r\nthere were not more than fifty such families. Although the patricians\r\nthroughout this whole period had the character of an aristocracy of\r\nbirth, yet their political rights were not the same at all times.\r\nDuring the first centuries of the republic there was an almost\r\nuninterrupted struggle between patricians and plebeians, in which\r\nthe former exerted every means to retain their exclusive rights, but\r\nwhich ended in the establishment of the political equality of the\r\ntwo orders. [PLEBES.] Only a few insignificant priestly offices, and\r\nthe performance of certain ancient religious rites and ceremonies,\r\nremained the exclusive privilege of the patricians; of which they\r\nwere the prouder, as in former days their religious power and\r\nsignificance were the basis of their political superiority. At the\r\ntime when the struggle between patricians and plebeians ceased, a new\r\nkind of aristocracy began to arise at Rome, which was partly based\r\nupon wealth, and partly upon the great offices of the republic, and\r\nthe term nobiles was given to all persons whose ancestors had held\r\nany of the curule offices. (Compare NOBILES.) This aristocracy of\r\nnobiles threw the old patricians as a body still more into the shade,\r\nthough both classes of aristocrats united as far as was possible to\r\nmonopolise all the great offices of the state. In their dress and\r\nappearance the patricians were scarcely distinguished from the rest\r\nof the citizens, unless they were senators, curule magistrates, or\r\nequites, in which case they wore like others the ensigns peculiar\r\nto these classes. The only thing by which they seem to have been\r\ndistinguished in their appearance from other citizens was a peculiar\r\nkind of shoe, which covered the whole foot and part of the leg,\r\nthough it was not as high as the shoes of senators and curule\r\nmagistrates. These shoes were fastened with four strings (_corrigiae_\r\nor _lora patricia_) and adorned with a lunula on the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTRĪMI ET MĀTRĪMI were children born of parents, who had been\r\nmarried by the religious ceremony called confarreatio: they are\r\nalmost always mentioned in connection with religious rites and\r\nceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTRŎNŎMI (πατρονόμοι), magistrates at Sparta, who exercised, as it\r\nwere, a paternal power over the whole state. They did not exist till\r\na late period, and they succeeded to the powers which the ephori\r\nformerly possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂTRŌNUS. The act of manumission created a new relation between\r\nthe manumissor and the slave, which was analogous to that between\r\nfather and son. The manumissor became with respect to the manumitted\r\nperson his patronus, and the manumitted person became the libertus\r\nof the manumissor. The word patronus (from pater) indicates the\r\nnature of the relation. If the manumissor was a woman, she became\r\npatrona. The libertus adopted the gentile name of the manumissor.\r\nCicero’s freedman Tiro was called M. Tullius Tiro. The libertus owed\r\nrespect and gratitude to his patron, and in ancient times the patron\r\nmight punish him in a summary way for neglecting those duties. This\r\nobligation extended to the children of the libertus, and the duty was\r\ndue to the children of the patron. It was the duty of the patron to\r\nsupport his freedman in case of necessity, and if he did not, he lost\r\nhis patronal rights; the consequence was the same if he brought a\r\ncapital charge against him. The most important of the patronal rights\r\nrelated to the property of liberti, as in certain cases the patronus\r\nhad a right to the whole or a part of the property of a libertus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAUPĔRĬES, the legal term for mischief done by an animal\r\n(_quadrupes_) contrary to the nature of the animal, as if a man’s ox\r\ngored another man. In such cases the law of the Twelve Tables gave\r\nthe injured person an action against the owner of the animal for the\r\namount of the damage sustained. The owner was bound either to pay the\r\nfull amount of damages or to give up the animal to the injured person\r\n(_noxae dare_).\r\n\r\n\r\nPĂVĪMENTUM. [DOMUS, p. 144, _b_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPECTEN (κτείς), a comb. The Greeks and Romans used combs made of\r\nbox-wood. The Egyptians had ivory combs, which also came into use by\r\ndegrees among the Romans. The wooden combs, found in Egyptian tombs,\r\nare toothed on one side only; but the Greeks used them with teeth on\r\nboth sides. The principal use of the comb was for dressing the hair,\r\nin doing which the Greeks of both sexes were remarkably careful and\r\ndiligent. To go with uncombed hair was a sign of affliction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔCŬLĀTUS, is properly the misappropriation or theft of public\r\nproperty. The person guilty of this offence was _peculator_. The\r\norigin of the word appears to be _pecus_, a term which originally\r\ndenoted that kind of moveable property which was the chief sign of\r\nwealth. Originally trials for _peculatus_ were before the populus or\r\nthe senate. In the time of Cicero matters of _peculatus_ had become\r\none of the quaestiones perpetuae.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔCŪLĬUM. [SERVUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔCŪNĬA. [AES; ARGENTUM; AURUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔDĀRĬI. [SENATUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔDĬSĔQUI, a class of slaves, whose duty was to follow their master\r\nwhen he went out of his house. There was a similar class of female\r\nslaves, called _Pedisequae_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔDUM (κορώνη), a shepherd’s crook. On account of its connection\r\nwith pastoral life, the crook is often seen in works of ancient art,\r\nin the hands of Pan, Satyrs, Fauns, and shepherds. It was also the\r\nusual attribute of Thalia, as the muse of pastoral poetry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pedum, Shepherd’s Crook. (From a Painting found at\r\nCivita Vecchia.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPEGMA (πῆγμα), a pageant, _i.e._ an edifice of wood, consisting of\r\ntwo or more stages (_tabulata_), which were raised or depressed at\r\npleasure by means of balance weights. These great machines were used\r\nin the Roman amphitheatres, the gladiators who fought upon them\r\nbeing called _pegmares_. They were supported upon wheels so as to\r\nbe drawn into the circus, glittering with silver and a profusion of\r\nwealth. When Vespasian and Titus celebrated their triumph over the\r\nJews, the procession included pageants of extraordinary magnitude\r\nand splendour, consisting of three or four stages above one another,\r\nhung with rich tapestry, and inlaid with ivory and gold. By the aid\r\nof various contrivances they represented battles and their numerous\r\nincidents, and the attack and defence of the cities of Judaea. The\r\npegma was also used in sacrifices. A bull having been slain in one of\r\nthe stages, the high priest placed himself below in a cavern, so as\r\nto receive the blood upon his person and his garments, and in this\r\nstate he was produced by the flamines before the worshippers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔLĂTAE (πελάται), were free labourers working for hire, like the\r\n_thetes_, in contra-distinction to the helots and penestae, who were\r\nbondsmen or serfs. In the later Greek writers, such as Dionysius of\r\nHalicarnassus, and Plutarch, the word is used for the Latin cliens,\r\nthough the relations expressed by the two terms are by no means\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\n\r\nPELTA (πέλτη), a small shield. Iphicrates, observing that the ancient\r\nCLIPEUS was cumbrous and inconvenient, introduced among the Greeks a\r\nmuch smaller and lighter shield, from which those who bore it took\r\nthe name of _peltastae_. It consisted principally of a frame of wood\r\nor wicker-work, covered with skin or leather.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔNESTAE (πενέσται), a class of serfs in Thessaly, who stood in\r\nnearly the same relation to their Thessalian lords as the helots of\r\nLaconia did to the Dorian Spartans, although their condition seems\r\nto have been on the whole superior. They were the descendants of the\r\nold Pelasgic or Aeolian inhabitants of Thessaly Proper. They occupied\r\nan intermediate position between freemen and purchased slaves, and\r\nthey cultivated the land for their masters, paying by way of rent\r\na portion of the produce of it. The Penestae sometimes accompanied\r\ntheir masters to battle, and fought on horseback as their vassals:\r\na circumstance which need not excite surprise, as Thessaly was so\r\nfamous for cavalry. There were Penestae among the Macedonians also.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔNĔTRĀLE. [TEMPLUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĒNĬCILLUS. [PICTURA, p. 295 _a_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTĂCOSĬŎMĔDIMNI. [CENSUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTATHLON (πένταθλον, _quinquertium_), was next to the pancratium\r\nthe most beautiful of all athletic performances. The persons engaged\r\nin it were called _Pentathli_ (πένταθλοι). The pentathlon consisted\r\nof five distinct kinds of games, viz. leaping (ἅλμα), the foot-race\r\n(δρόμος), the throwing of the discus (δίσκος), the throwing of the\r\nspear (σίγυννος or ἀκόντιον), and wrestling (πάλη), which were all\r\nperformed in one day and in a certain order, one after the other, by\r\nthe same athletae. The pentathlon was introduced in the Olympic games\r\nin Ol. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTĒCOSTĒ (πεντηκοστή), a duty of two per cent, levied upon all\r\nexports and imports at Athens. The money was collected by persons\r\ncalled πεντηκοστολόγοι. The merchant who paid the duty was said\r\nπεντηκοντεύεσθαι. All the customs appear to have been let to farm,\r\nand probably from year to year. They were let to the highest bidders\r\nby the ten _Poletae_, acting under the authority of the senate. The\r\nfarmers were called τελῶναι, and were said ὠνεῖσθαι τὴν πεντηκοστήν.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPLUM or PEPLUS (πέπλος), an outer garment or shawl, strictly worn\r\nby females, and thus corresponding to the himation or pallium, the\r\nouter garment worn by men. Like all other pieces of cloth used for\r\nthe AMICTUS, it was often fastened by means of a brooch. It was,\r\nhowever, frequently worn without a brooch. The shawl was also often\r\nworn so as to cover the head while it enveloped the body, and more\r\nespecially on occasion of a funeral or of a marriage, when a very\r\nsplendid shawl (παστός) was worn by the bride. The following woodcut\r\nmay be supposed to represent the moment when the bride, so veiled, is\r\ndelivered to her husband at the door of the nuptial chamber. He wears\r\nthe PALLIUM only; she has a long shift beneath her shawl, and is\r\nsupported by the pronuba. Of all the productions of the loom, pepli\r\nwere those on which the greatest skill and labour were bestowed.\r\nSo various and tasteful were the subjects which they represented,\r\nthat poets delighted to describe them. The art of weaving them was\r\nentirely oriental; and those of the most splendid dyes and curious\r\nworkmanship were imported from Tyre and Sidon. They often constituted\r\na very important part of the treasures of a temple, having been\r\npresented to the divinity by suppliants and devotees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peplum. (Bartoli, ‘Admir. Rom. Ant.,’ pl. 57.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĒRA (πήρα), a wallet, made of leather, worn suspended at the side by\r\nrustics and by travellers to carry their provisions, and adopted in\r\nimitation of them by the Cynic philosophers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERDŬELLĬO was in the ancient times of the republic nearly the same\r\nas the _Majestas_ of the later times. [MAJESTAS.] _Perduellis_\r\noriginally signified _hostis_, and thus the offence was equivalent\r\nto making war on the Roman state. Offenders were tried by two\r\njudges called _Perduellionis Duumviri_. In the time of the kings\r\nthe duumviri perduellionis and the quaestores parricidii appear\r\nto have been the same persons; but after the establishment of\r\nthe republic, the offices were distinct, for the quaestores were\r\nappointed regularly every year, whereas the duumviri were appointed\r\nvery rarely, as had been the case during the kingly period. Livy\r\nrepresents the duumviri perduellionis as being appointed by the\r\nkings, but they were really proposed by the king and appointed by the\r\npopulus. During the early part of the republic they were appointed\r\nby the comitia curiata, and afterwards by the comitia centuriata,\r\non the proposal of the consuls. In the case of Rabirius (B.C. 63),\r\nhowever, this custom was violated, as the duumviri were appointed\r\nby the praetor instead of by the comitia centuriata. The punishment\r\nfor those who were found guilty of perduellio was death; they were\r\neither hanged on the _arbor infelix_, or thrown from the Tarpeian\r\nrock. But when the duumviri found a person guilty, he might appeal\r\nto the people (in early times the populus, afterwards the comitia\r\ncenturiata), as was done in the first case which is on record, that\r\nof Horatius, and in the last, which is that of Rabirius, whom Cicero\r\ndefended before the people in the oration still extant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔRĔGRĪNUS, a stranger or foreigner. In ancient times the word\r\n_peregrinus_ was used as synonymous with _hostis_; but in the times\r\nof which we have historical records, a peregrinus was any person who\r\nwas not a Roman citizen. In B.C. 247, a second praetor (_praetor\r\nperegrinus_) was appointed for the purpose of administering justice\r\nin matters between Romans and peregrini, and in matters between such\r\nperegrini as had taken up their abode at Rome. [PRAETOR.] The number\r\nof peregrini who lived in the city of Rome appears to have had an\r\ninjurious influence upon the poorer classes of Roman citizens, whence\r\non some occasions they were driven out of the city. The first example\r\nof this kind was set in B.C. 127, by the tribune M. Junius Pennus.\r\nThey were expelled a second time by the tribune C. Papius, in B.C.\r\n66. During the last period of the republic and the first centuries\r\nof the empire, all the free inhabitants of the Roman world were, in\r\nregard to their political rights, either Roman citizens, or Latins,\r\nor peregrini, and the latter had, as before, neither commercium nor\r\nconnubium with the Romans. They were either free provincials, or\r\ncitizens who had forfeited their civitas, and were degraded to the\r\nrank of peregrini, or a certain class of freedmen, called peregrini\r\ndediticii.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔRĬOECI (περίοικοι). This word properly denotes the inhabitants of\r\na district lying around some particular locality, but is generally\r\nused to describe a dependent population, living without the walls or\r\nin the country provinces of a dominant city, and although personally\r\nfree, deprived of the enjoyment of citizenship, and the political\r\nrights conferred by it. A political condition such as that of the\r\n_perioeci_ of Greece, and like the vassalage of the Germanic nations,\r\ncould hardly have originated in anything else than foreign conquest,\r\nand the _perioeci_ of Laconia furnish a striking illustration\r\nof this. Their origin dates from the Dorian conquest of the\r\nPeloponnesus, when the old inhabitants of the country, the Achaeans,\r\nsubmitted to their conquerors on certain conditions, by which they\r\nwere left in possession of their private rights of citizenship.\r\nThey suffered indeed a partial deprivation of their lands, and were\r\nobliged to submit to a king of foreign race, but still they remained\r\nequal in law to their conquerors, and were eligible to all offices\r\nof state except the sovereignty. But this state of things did not\r\nlast long: in the next generation after the conquest the relation\r\nbetween the two parties was changed. The Achaeans were reduced from\r\ncitizens to vassals; they were made tributary to Sparta; their lands\r\nwere subjected to a tax; and they lost their rights of citizenship,\r\nthe right of voting in the general assembly, and their eligibility\r\nto important offices in the state, such as that of a senator, &c.\r\nIt does not, however, appear that the _perioeci_ were generally an\r\noppressed people, though kept in a state of political inferiority\r\nto their conquerors. On the contrary, the most distinguished among\r\nthem were admitted to offices of trust, and they sometimes served as\r\nheavy-armed soldiers; as, for instance, at the battle of Plataea. The\r\nNorman conquest of England presents a striking parallel to the Dorian\r\nconquest of Laconia, both in its achievement and consequences. The\r\nSaxons, like the old Achaeans, were deprived of their lands, excluded\r\nfrom all offices of trust and dignity, and reduced, though personally\r\nfree, to a state of political slavery. The Normans, on the contrary,\r\nof whatever rank in their own country, were all nobles and warriors,\r\ncompared with the conquered Saxons, and for a long time enjoyed\r\nexclusively the civil and ecclesiastical administration of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔRISCĔLIS (περισκελίς), an anklet or bangle, worn by the Orientals,\r\nthe Greeks, and the Roman ladies also. It decorated the leg in the\r\nsame manner as the bracelet adorns the wrist and the necklace the\r\nthroat. The word, however, is sometimes used in the same sense as the\r\nLatin _feminalia_, that is, drawers reaching from the navel to the\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Periscelis, Anklet, worn by a Nereid. (Museo\r\nBorbonico, vol. VI. tav. 34.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔRISTRŌMA, a coverlet large enough to hang round the sides of the\r\nbed or couch.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔRISTȲLĬUM. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĒRO (ἀρβύλη), a low boot of untanned hide worn by ploughmen\r\n(_peronatus arator_), shepherds, and others employed in rural\r\noccupations. The term ἀρβύλη is applied to an appendage to the Greek\r\nchariot. It seems to have been a shoe fastened to the bottom of the\r\nchariot, into which the driver inserted his foot, to assist him in\r\ndriving, and to prevent him from being thrown out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Masks. (From a Tomb at Sidyma in Lycia.)]\r\n\r\nPERSŌNA (_larva_, πρόσωπον or προσωπεῖον), a mask. Masks were worn\r\nby Greek and Roman actors in nearly all dramatic representations.\r\nThis custom arose undoubtedly from the practice of smearing the\r\nface with certain juices and colours, and of appearing in disguise,\r\nat the festivals of Dionysus. [DIONYSIA.] Now, as the Greek drama\r\narose out of these festivals, it is highly probable that some mode\r\nof disguising the face was as old as the drama itself. Choerilus\r\nof Samos, however, (about B.C. 500) is said to have been the first\r\nwho introduced regular masks. Other writers attribute the invention\r\nof masks to Thespis or Aeschylus, though the latter had probably\r\nonly the merit of perfecting and completing the whole theatrical\r\napparatus and costume. Some masks covered, like the masks of modern\r\ntimes, only the face, but they appear more generally to have covered\r\nthe whole head down to the shoulders, for we always find the hair\r\nbelonging to a mask described as being a part of it; and this must\r\nhave been the case in tragedy more especially, as it was necessary\r\nto make the head correspond to the stature of an actor, which was\r\nheightened by the cothurnus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Comic Mask. (Statue of Davus in British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPES (ποῦς), a foot, the standard measure of length among the Greeks\r\nand Romans, as well as among nearly all other nations, both ancient\r\nand modern. The Romans applied the uncial division [AS] to the foot,\r\nwhich thus contained 12 _unciae_, whence our _inches_; and many of\r\nthe words used to express certain numbers of unciae are applied\r\nto the parts of the foot. It was also divided into 16 _digiti_\r\n(finger-breadths): this mode of division was used especially by\r\narchitects and land-surveyors, and is found on all the foot-measures\r\nthat have come down to us. From the analogy of the as, we have\r\nalso _dupondium_ for 2 feet, and _pes sestertius_ for 2½ feet. The\r\nprobable value of the Roman foot is 11.6496 inches English.

[ACTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔTAURISTAE. [PETAURUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔTAURUM (πέταυρον, πέτευρον), used in the Roman games, seems to\r\nhave been a board moving up and down, with a person at each end, and\r\nsupported in the middle, something like our see-saw; only it appears\r\nto have been much longer, and consequently went to a greater height\r\nthan is common amongst us. The persons who took part in this game,\r\nwere called _Petauristae_ or _Petauristarii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĔTORRĬTUM, a four-wheeled carriage, which, like the ESSEDUM, was\r\nadopted by the Romans in imitation of the Gauls. It differed from\r\nthe HARMAMAXA in being uncovered. Its name is compounded of _petor_,\r\nfour, and _rit_, a wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHĂLANX. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHĂLĂRĬCA. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHĂLĔRAE (φάλαρον), a boss, disc, or crescent of metal, in many cases\r\nof gold, and beautifully wrought so as to be highly prized. They were\r\nusually worn in pairs; and we most commonly read of them as ornaments\r\nattached to the harness of horses, especially about the head, and\r\noften worn as pendants (_pensilia_), so as to produce a terrific\r\neffect when shaken by the rapid motions of the horse. These ornaments\r\nwere often bestowed upon horsemen by the Roman generals, in the\r\nsame manner as the ARMILLA, the TORQUES, the hasta pura [HASTA], and\r\nthe crown of gold [CORONA], in order to make a public and permanent\r\nacknowledgment of bravery and merit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHĂRETRA (φαρέτρα), a quiver, was principally made of hide or\r\nleather, and was adorned with gold, painting, and braiding. It had\r\na lid (πῶμα), and was suspended from the right shoulder by a belt\r\npassing over the breast and behind the back. Its most common position\r\nwas on the left hip, and is so seen in the annexed figures, the\r\nright-hand one representing an Amazon, and the left-hand an Asiatic\r\narcher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pharetrae, Quivers. (Left-hand figure from the\r\nAeginetan Marbles; right-hand figure from a Greek Vase.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHARMĂCŌN GRĂPHĒ (φαρμάκων or φαρμακείας γραφή), an indictment at\r\nAthens against one who caused the death of another by poison, whether\r\ngiven with intent to kill or to obtain undue influence. It was tried\r\nby the court of Areiopagus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHĂROS or PHĂRUS (φάρος), a light-house. The most celebrated\r\nlight-house of antiquity was that situated at the entrance to the\r\nport of Alexandria, on an island which bore the name of Pharos. It\r\ncontained many stories, and the upper stories had windows looking\r\nseawards, and torches or fires were kept burning in them by night in\r\norder to guide vessels into the harbour. The name of Pharos was given\r\nto other light-houses, in allusion to that at Alexandria, which was\r\nthe model for their construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHĂSĒLUS (φάσηλος), a vessel rather long and narrow, apparently\r\nso called from its resemblance to the shape of a phaselus or\r\nkidney-bean. It was chiefly used by the Egyptians, and was of various\r\nsizes, from a mere boat to a vessel adapted for long voyages. The\r\nphaselus was built for speed, to which more attention seems to have\r\nbeen paid than to its strength: whence the epithet _fragilis_ is\r\ngiven to it by Horace. These vessels were sometimes made of clay, to\r\nwhich the epithet of Horace may perhaps also refer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASIS (φάσις, from φαίνω), one of the various methods by which\r\npublic offenders at Athens might be prosecuted; but the word is\r\noften used to denote any kind of information; and we do not know in\r\nwhat respects the _Phasis_ was distinguished from other methods of\r\nprosecution. The word _sycophantes_ (συκοφάντης) is derived from\r\nthe practice of laying information against those who exported figs.\r\n[SYCOPHANTES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHORMINX. [LYRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHRATRĬA. [TRIBUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHỸLARCHI (φύλαρχοι) were at Athens after the age of Cleisthenes ten\r\nofficers, one for each of the tribes, and were specially charged with\r\nthe command and superintendence of the cavalry. There can be but\r\nlittle doubt that each of the phylarchs commanded the cavalry of his\r\nown tribe, and they were themselves collectively and individually\r\nunder the control of the two hipparchs, just as the taxiarchs\r\nwere subject to the two strategi. Herodotus informs us that when\r\nCleisthenes increased the number of the tribes from four to ten,\r\nhe also made ten phylarchs instead of four. It has been thought,\r\nhowever, that the historian should have said ten phylarchs in the\r\nplace of the old phylobasileis, who were four in number, one for each\r\nof the old tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHỸLŎBĂSĬLEIS (φυλοβασιλεῖς) were four in number, representing\r\neach one of the four ancient Athenian tribes, and probably elected\r\n(but not for life) from and by them. They were nominated from the\r\nEupatridae, and during the continuance of royalty at Athens these\r\n“kings of the tribes” were the constant assessors of the sovereign,\r\nand rather as his colleagues than counsellors. Though they were\r\noriginally connected with the four ancient tribes, still they were\r\nnot abolished by Cleisthenes when he increased the number of tribes,\r\nprobably because their duties were mainly of a religious character.\r\nThey appear to have existed even after his time, and acted as judges,\r\nbut in unimportant or merely formal matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICTŪRA (γραφή, γραφική, ζωγραφία), painting. I. _History of the\r\nArt._ It is singular that the poems of Homer do not contain any\r\nmention of painting as an imitative art. This is the more remarkable,\r\nsince Homer speaks of rich and elaborate embroidery as a thing not\r\nuncommon. This embroidery is actual painting in principle, and is\r\na species of painting in practice, and it was considered such by\r\nthe Romans, who termed it “pictura textilis.” The various allusions\r\nalso to other arts, similar in nature to painting, are sufficient to\r\nprove that painting must have existed in some degree in Homer’s time,\r\nalthough the only kind of painting he notices is the “red-cheeked”\r\nand “purple-cheeked ships,” and an ivory ornament for the faces\r\nof horses, which a Maeonian or Carian woman colours with purple.\r\nPainting seems to have made considerable progress in Asia Minor\r\nwhile it was still in its infancy in Greece, for Candaules, king\r\nof Lydia (B.C. 716), is said to have purchased at a high price a\r\npainting of Bularchus, which represented a battle of the Magnetes.\r\nThe old Ionic painting probably flourished at the same time with the\r\nIonian architecture, and continued as an independent school until\r\nthe sixth century B.C., when the Ionians lost their liberty, and\r\nwith their liberty their art. Herodotus (i. 164) mentions that when\r\nHarpagus besieged the town of Phocaea (B.C. 544), the inhabitants\r\ncollected all their valuables, their statues and votive offerings\r\nfrom the temples, leaving only their _paintings_, and such works in\r\nmetal or of stone as could not easily be removed, and fled with them\r\nto the island of Chios; from which we may conclude that paintings\r\nwere not only valued by the Phocaeans, but also common among them.\r\nHerodotus (iv. 88) also informs us that Mandrocles of Samos, who\r\nconstructed for Darius Hystaspis the bridge of boats across the\r\nBosporus (B.C. 508), had a picture painted, representing the passage\r\nof Darius’s army, and the king seated on a throne reviewing the\r\ntroops as they passed, which he dedicated in the temple of Hera at\r\nSamos. After the conquest of Ionia, Samos became the seat of the\r\narts. The Heraeum at Samos, in which the picture of Mandrocles was\r\nplaced, was a general depository for works of art, and in the time\r\nof Strabo appears to have been particularly rich in paintings, for\r\nhe terms it a “picture-gallery” (πινακοθήκη). The first painter in\r\nGreece itself, whose name is recorded, is Cimon of Cleonae. His exact\r\nperiod is uncertain, but he was probably a contemporary of Solon, and\r\nlived at least a century before Polygnotus. It was with Polygnotus\r\nof Thasos that painting reached its full development (about B.C.\r\n463). Previous to this time the only cities that had paid any\r\nconsiderable attention to painting were Aegina, Sicyon, Corinth, and\r\nAthens. Sicyon and Corinth had long been famous for their paintings\r\nupon vases and upon articles of furniture; the school of Athens had\r\nattained no celebrity whatever until the arrival of Polygnotus from\r\nThasos raised it to that pre-eminence which it continued to maintain\r\nfor more than two centuries, although very few of the great painters\r\nof Greece were natives of Athens. The principal contemporaries of\r\nPolygnotus were Dionysius of Colophon, Plistaenetus and Panaenus of\r\nAthens, brothers (or the latter perhaps a nephew) of Phidias, and\r\nMicon, also of Athens. The works of Polygnotus and his contemporaries\r\nwere conspicuous for expression, character, and design; the more\r\nminute discriminations of tone and local colour, united with\r\ndramatic composition and effect, were accomplished in the succeeding\r\ngeneration, about 420 B.C., through the efforts of Apollodorus of\r\nAthens and Zeuxis of Heraclea. The contemporaries of Apollodorus and\r\nZeuxis, and those who carried out their principles, were Parrhasius\r\nof Ephesus, Eupompus of Sicyon, and Timanthes of Cythnus, all\r\npainters of the greatest fame. Athens and Sicyon were the principal\r\nseats of the art at this period. Eupompus of Sicyon was the founder\r\nof the celebrated Sicyonian school of painting which was afterwards\r\nestablished by Pamphilus. The Alexandrian period was the last of\r\nprogression or acquisition; but it only added variety of effect to\r\nthe tones it could not improve, and was principally characterised\r\nby the diversity of the styles of so many contemporary artists. The\r\nmost eminent painters of this period were Protogenes, Pamphilus,\r\nMelanthius, Antiphilus, Theon of Samos, Apelles, Euphranor, Pausias,\r\nNicias, Nicomachus, and his brother Aristides. Of all these Apelles\r\nwas the greatest. The quality in which he surpassed all other\r\npainters will scarcely bear a definition; it has been termed grace,\r\nelegance, beauty, χάρις, _venustas_. His greatest work was perhaps\r\nhis Venus Anadyomene, Venus rising out of the waters. He excelled in\r\nportrait, and indeed all his works appear to have been portraits in\r\nan extended sense; for his pictures, both historical and allegorical,\r\nconsisted nearly all of single figures. He enjoyed the exclusive\r\nprivilege of painting the portraits of Alexander.--The works of Greek\r\nart brought from Sicily by Marcellus were the first to inspire the\r\nRomans with the desire of adorning their public edifices with statues\r\nand paintings, which taste was converted into a passion when they\r\nbecame acquainted with the great treasures and almost inexhaustible\r\nresources of Greece, and their rapacity knew no bounds. Mummius,\r\nafter the destruction of Corinth, B.C. 146, carried off or destroyed\r\nmore works of art than all his predecessors put together. Scaurus, in\r\nhis aedileship, B.C. 58, had all the public pictures still remaining\r\nin Sicyon transported to Rome, on account of the debts of the former\r\ncity, and he adorned the great temporary theatre which he erected\r\nupon that occasion with 3000 bronze statues. Verres ransacked Asia\r\nand Achaia, and plundered almost every temple and public edifice in\r\nSicily of whatever was valuable in it. Amongst the numerous robberies\r\nof Verres, Cicero mentions particularly twenty-seven beautiful\r\npictures taken from the temple of Minerva at Syracuse, consisting of\r\nportraits of the kings and tyrants of Sicily. Yet Rome was, about\r\nthe end of the republic, full of painters, who appear, however, to\r\nhave been chiefly occupied in portrait, or decorative and arabesque\r\npainting. Among the Romans the earliest painter mentioned is a member\r\nof the noble house of the Fabii, who received the surname of Pictor\r\nthrough some paintings which he executed in the temple of Salus at\r\nRome, B.C. 304, which lasted till the time of the emperor Claudius,\r\nwhen they were destroyed by the fire that consumed that temple.\r\nPacuvius also, the tragic poet, and nephew of Ennius, distinguished\r\nhimself by some paintings in the temple of Hercules in the Forum\r\nBoarium, about 180 B.C. But generally speaking the artists at Rome\r\nwere Greeks. Julius Caesar, Agrippa, and Augustus were among the\r\nearliest great patrons of artists. Caesar expended great sums in\r\nthe purchase of pictures by the old masters. He gave as much as 80\r\ntalents for two pictures by his contemporary Timomachus of Byzantium,\r\none an Ajax, and the other a Medea meditating the murder of her\r\nchildren. These pictures, which were painted in encaustic, were very\r\ncelebrated works; they are alluded to by Ovid (_Trist._ ii. 525),\r\nand are mentioned by many other ancient writers.--There are three\r\ndistinct periods observable in the history of painting in Rome. The\r\nfirst or great period of Graeco-Roman art may be dated from the\r\nconquest of Greece until the time of Augustus, when the artists\r\nwere chiefly Greeks. The second, from the time of Augustus to the\r\nso-called Thirty Tyrants and Diocletian, or from the beginning of the\r\nChristian era until about the latter end of the third century, during\r\nwhich time the great majority of Roman works of art were produced.\r\nThe third comprehends the state of the arts during the exarchate,\r\nwhen Rome, in consequence of the foundation of Constantinople, and\r\nthe changes it involved, suffered similar spoliations to those which\r\nit had previously inflicted upon Greece. This was the period of the\r\ntotal decay of the imitative arts amongst the ancients. About the\r\nbeginning of the second period is the earliest age in which we have\r\nany notice of portrait painters (_imaginum pictores_) as a distinct\r\nclass. Portraits must have been exceedingly numerous amongst the\r\nRomans; Varro made a collection of the portraits of 700 eminent\r\nmen. The portraits or statues of men who had performed any public\r\nservice were placed in the temples and other public places; and\r\nseveral edicts were passed by the emperors of Rome respecting the\r\nplacing of them. The portraits of authors also were placed in the\r\npublic libraries; they were apparently fixed above the cases which\r\ncontained their writings, below which chairs were placed for the\r\nconvenience of readers. They were painted also at the beginning of\r\nmanuscripts. Several of the most celebrated ancient artists were both\r\nsculptors and painters; Phidias and Euphranor were both; Zeuxis and\r\nProtogenes were both modellers; Polygnotus devoted some attention to\r\nstatuary; and Lysippus consulted Eupompus upon style in sculpture.\r\nMoreover scene-painting shows that the Greeks were acquainted with\r\nperspective at a very early period; for when Aeschylus was exhibiting\r\ntragedies at Athens, Agatharchus made a scene, and left a treatise\r\nupon it.--II. _Methods of Painting._ There were two distinct classes\r\nof painting practised by the ancients--in water colours, and in\r\nwax, both of which were practised in various ways. Of the former\r\nthe principal were fresco, al fresco; and the various kinds of\r\ndistemper (a tempera), with glue, with the white of egg, or with gums\r\n(a guazzo); and with wax or resins when these were rendered by any\r\nmeans vehicles that could be worked with water. Of the latter the\r\nprincipal was through fire (διὰ πυρὸς), termed encaustic (ἐγκαυστική,\r\n_encaustica_). The painting in wax (κηρογραφία), or ship painting\r\n(_inceramenta navium_), was distinct from encaustic. It does not\r\nappear that the Greeks or Romans ever painted in oil; the only\r\nmention of oil in ancient writers in connection with painting is\r\nthe small quantity which entered into the composition of encaustic\r\nvarnish to temper it. They painted upon wood, clay, plaster, stone,\r\nparchment, and canvas. The use of canvas must have been of late\r\nintroduction, as there is no mention of it having been employed\r\nby the Greek painters of the best periods. They generally painted\r\nupon panels or tablets (πίνακες, πινόκια, _tabulae_, _tabellae_),\r\nwhich when finished were fixed into frames of various descriptions\r\nand materials, and encased in walls. The style or cestrum used in\r\ndrawing, and for spreading the wax colours, pointed at one end\r\nand broad and flat at the other, was termed γραφίς by the Greeks\r\nand cestrum by the Romans; it was generally made of metal. The\r\nhair pencil (_penicillus_, _penicillum_) was termed ὑπογραφίς, and\r\napparently also ῥαβδίον. The ancients used also a palette very\r\nsimilar to that used by the moderns. Encaustic was a method very\r\nfrequently practised by the Roman and later Greek painters; but it\r\nwas in very little use by the earlier painters, and was not generally\r\nadopted until after the time of Alexander. Pliny defines the term\r\nthus: “ceris pingere ac picturam inurere,” to paint with wax or wax\r\ncolours, and to _burn in_ the picture afterwards with the cauterium;\r\nit appears therefore to have been the simple addition of the\r\nprocess of _burning in_ to the ordinary method of painting with wax\r\ncolours. Cerae (waxes) was the ordinary term for painters’ colours\r\namongst the Romans, but more especially encaustic colours, and they\r\nkept them in partitioned boxes, as painters do at present.--III.\r\n_Polychromy._ Ancient statues were often painted, and what is now\r\ntermed polychrome sculpture was very common in Greece. The practice\r\nof colouring statues is undoubtedly as ancient as the art of statuary\r\nitself; although they were perhaps originally coloured more from a\r\nlove of colour than from any design of improving the resemblance\r\nof the representation. The Jupiter of the Capitol, placed by\r\nTarquinius Priscus, was coloured with minium. In later times the\r\ncustom seems to have been reduced to a system, and was practised\r\nwith more reserve. The practice also of colouring architecture\r\nseems to have been universal amongst the Greeks, and very general\r\namongst the Romans.--IV. _Vase Painting._ The fictile-vase painting\r\nof the Greeks was an art of itself, and was practised by a distinct\r\nclass of artists. The designs upon these vases (which the Greeks\r\ntermed λήκυθοι) have been variously interpreted, but they have been\r\ngenerally considered to be in some way connected with the initiation\r\ninto the Eleusinian and other mysteries. They were given as prizes\r\nto the victors at the Panathenaea and other games, and seem to have\r\nbeen always buried with their owners at their death, for they have\r\nbeen discovered only in tombs. Even in the time of the Roman empire\r\npainted vases were termed “operis antiqui,” and were then sought for\r\nin the ancient tombs of Campania and other parts of Magna Graecia.\r\nWe may form some idea of their immense value from the statement\r\nof Pliny, that they were more valuable than the Murrhine vases.\r\n[MURRHINA VASA.] The paintings on the vases, considered as works of\r\nart, vary exceedingly in the detail of the execution, although in\r\nstyle of design they may be arranged in two principal classes, the\r\nblack and the yellow; for those which do not come strictly under\r\neither of these heads are either too few or vary too slightly to\r\nrequire a distinct classification. The black are the most ancient,\r\nthe yellow the most common.--V. _Mosaic_, or _pictura de musivo_,\r\n_opus musivum_, was very general in Rome in the time of the early\r\nemperors. It was also common in Greece and Asia Minor at an earlier\r\nperiod, but at the time of the Roman empire it began to a great\r\nextent even to supersede painting. It was used chiefly for floors,\r\nbut walls and also ceilings were sometimes ornamented in the same\r\nway. There are still many great mosaics of the ancients extant. The\r\nmost valuable is the one discovered in Pompeii a few years ago,\r\nwhich is supposed to represent the battle of Issus. The composition\r\nis simple, forcible, and beautiful, and the design exhibits in many\r\nrespects merits of the highest order.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĪLA (σφαῖρα), a ball. The game at ball (σφαιριστική) was one of the\r\nmost favourite gymnastic exercises of the Greeks and Romans, from\r\nthe earliest times to the fall of the Roman empire. It is mentioned\r\nin the Odyssey, where it is played by the Phaeacian damsels to the\r\nsound of music, and also by two celebrated performers at the court\r\nof Alcinous in a most artistic manner accompanied with dancing. The\r\nvarious movements of the body required in the game of ball gave\r\nelasticity and grace to the figure; whence it was highly esteemed\r\nby the Greeks. The Athenians set so high a value on it, that they\r\nconferred upon Aristonicus of Carystus the right of citizenship on\r\naccount of his skill in this game. It was equally esteemed by the\r\nother states of Greece; the young Spartans, when they were leaving\r\nthe condition of ephebi, were called σφαιρεῖς, probably because\r\ntheir chief exercise was the game at ball. Every complete gymnasium\r\nhad a room (σφαιριστήριον, σφαίριστρα) devoted to this exercise\r\n[GYMNASIUM], where a special teacher (σφαιριστικός) gave instruction\r\nin the art. Among the Romans the game at ball was generally played\r\nat by persons before taking the bath, in a room (_sphaeristerium_)\r\nattached to the baths for the purpose. _Pila_ was used in a general\r\nsense for any kind of ball: but the balls among the Romans seem to\r\nhave been of three kinds; the _pila_ in its narrower sense, a small\r\nball; the _follis_, a great ball filled with air; and the _paganica_,\r\nof which we know scarcely anything, but which appears to have been\r\nsmaller than the follis and larger than the pila. The _Harpastum_\r\n(from ἁρπάζω) seems to have been the name of a ball, which was thrown\r\namong the players, each of whom endeavoured to catch it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pila, Game at Ball. (From the Baths of Titus.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĪLĀNI. [EXERCITUS, p. 168 _b_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĪLENTUM, a splendid four-wheeled carriage, furnished with soft\r\ncushions, which conveyed the Roman matrons in sacred processions and\r\nin going to the Circensian and other games. The pilentum was probably\r\nvery like the HARMAMAXA and CARPENTUM, but open at the sides, so that\r\nthose who sat in it might both see and be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPĪLĔUS or PĪLĔUM (πϊλος, πίλημα, πιλωτόν), any piece of felt; more\r\nespecially a skull-cap of felt, a hat. There seems no reason to doubt\r\nthat felting is a more ancient invention than weaving [TELA], nor\r\nthat both of these arts came into Europe from Asia. From the Greeks,\r\nwho were acquainted with this article as early as the age of Homer,\r\nthe use of felt passed together with its name to the Romans. Its\r\nprincipal use was to make coverings of the head for the male sex,\r\nand the most common one was a simple skull-cap.--Among the Romans\r\nthe cap of felt was the emblem of liberty. When a slave obtained\r\nhis freedom he had his head shaven, and wore instead of his hair an\r\nundyed pileus. This change of attire took place in the temple of\r\nFeronia, who was the goddess of freedmen. Hence the phrase _servos\r\nad pileum vocare_ is a summons to liberty, by which slaves were\r\nfrequently called upon to take up arms with a promise of liberty.\r\nThe figure of Liberty on some of the coins of Antoninus Pius,\r\nstruck A.D. 145, holds this cap in the right hand. The _Petasus_\r\n(πέτασος) differed from the pileus or simple skull-cap in having a\r\nwide brim: the etymology of the word, from πετάννυμι, expresses the\r\ndistinctive shape of these hats. It was preferred to the skull-cap as\r\na protection from the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Petasus, Cap, worn by a Greek Soldier. (From a Greek\r\nVase.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPĪLUM. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPISCĪNA. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPISTOR (ἀρτοποιός), a baker, from _pinsere_, to pound, since corn was\r\npounded in mortars before the invention of mills. At Rome bread was\r\noriginally made at home by the women of the house; and there were\r\nno persons at Rome who made baking a trade, or any slaves specially\r\nkept for this purpose in private houses, till B.C. 173. The name was\r\nalso given to pastry-cooks and confectioners, in which case they\r\nwere usually called _pistores dulciarii_ or _candidarii_. Bread was\r\noften baked in moulds called _artoptae_, and the loaves thus baked\r\nwere termed ARTOPTICII. Bread was not generally made at home at\r\nAthens, but was sold in the market-place, chiefly by women, called\r\nἀρτοπώλιδες. These women seem to have been what the fish-women of\r\nLondon are at present; they excelled in abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLĂGĬĀRĬUS. [PLAGIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLĂGĬUM, the offence of kidnapping, concealing, and selling freemen\r\nand other persons’ slaves was the subject of a Fabia Lex (B.C. 183).\r\nThe penalty of the lex was pecuniary; but this fell into disuse,\r\nand persons who offended against the lex were punished according to\r\nthe nature of their offence; under the empire they were generally\r\ncondemned to the mines. The word _Plagium_ is said to come from the\r\nGreek πλάγιος, oblique, indirect, dolosus. He who committed _plagium_\r\nwas _plagiarius_, a word which Martial applies to a person who\r\nfalsely gave himself out as the author of a book; and in this sense\r\nthe word has come into common use in our language.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAUSTRUM or PLOSTRUM (ἅμαξα), a cart or waggon. It had commonly two\r\nwheels, but sometimes four, and it was then called the _plaustrum\r\nmajus_. Besides the wheels and axle the plaustrum consisted of a\r\nstrong pole (_temo_), to the hinder part of which was fastened a\r\ntable of wooden planks. The blocks of stone, or other things to be\r\ncarried, were either laid upon this table without any other support,\r\nor an additional security was obtained by the use either of boards\r\nat the sides, or of a large wicker basket tied upon the cart. The\r\nannexed cut exhibits a cart, the body of which is supplied by a\r\nbasket. The commonest kind of cart-wheel was that called _tympanum_,\r\n“the drum,” from its resemblance to the musical instrument of the\r\nsame name. It was nearly a foot in thickness, and was made either by\r\nsawing the trunk of a tree across in a horizontal direction, or by\r\nnailing together boards of the requisite shape and size. (See the\r\ncut.) These wheels advanced slowly, and made a loud creaking, which\r\nwas heard to a great distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plaustrum, Waggon. (From a Bas-Relief at Rome.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLĒBES or PLEBS. PLĒBĒII. This word contains the same root as\r\n_im-pleo_, _com-pleo_, &c., and is therefore etymologically\r\nconnected with πλῆθος, a term which was applied to the plebeians\r\nby the more correct Greek writers on Roman history, while others\r\nwrongly called them δῆμος or οἱ δημοτικοί. The plebeians were the\r\nbody of commons or the commonalty of Rome, and thus constituted\r\none of the two great elements of which the Roman nation consisted,\r\nand which has given to the earlier periods of Roman history its\r\npeculiar character and interest. The time when the plebeians first\r\nappear as a distinct class of Roman citizens in contradistinction\r\nto the patricians, is in the reign of Tullus Hostilius. Alba, the\r\nhead of the Latin confederacy, was in his reign taken by the Romans\r\nand razed to the ground. The most distinguished of its inhabitants\r\nwere transplanted to Rome and received among the patricians; but\r\nthe great bulk of Alban citizens, who were likewise transferred to\r\nRome, received settlements on the Caelian hill, and were kept in\r\na state of submission to the populus Romanus or the patricians.\r\nThis new population of Rome, which in number is said to have been\r\nequal to the old inhabitants of the city or the patricians, were\r\nthe plebeians. They were Latins, and consequently of the same\r\nblood as the Ramnes, the noblest of the three patrician tribes.\r\nAfter the conquest of Alba, Rome, in the reign of Ancus Martius,\r\nacquired possession of a considerable extent of country, containing\r\na number of dependent Latin towns, as Medullia, Fidenae, Politorium,\r\nTellenae, and Ficana. Great numbers of the inhabitants of these\r\ntowns were again transplanted to Rome, and incorporated with the\r\nplebeians already settled there, and the Aventine was assigned to\r\nthem as their habitation. Some portions of the land which these\r\nnew citizens had possessed were given back to them by the Romans,\r\nso that they remained free land-owners as much as the conquerors\r\nthemselves, and thus were distinct from the clients.--The plebeians\r\nwere citizens, but not _optimo jure_; they were perfectly distinct\r\nfrom the patricians, and were neither contained in the three tribes,\r\nnor in the curiae, nor in the patrician gentes. The only point of\r\ncontact between the two estates was the army. The plebeians were\r\nobliged to fight and shed their blood in the defence of their\r\nnew fellow-citizens, without being allowed to share any of their\r\nrights or privileges, and without even the right of intermarriage\r\n(_connubium_). In all judicial matters they were entirely at the\r\nmercy of the patricians, and had no right of appeal against any\r\nunjust sentence, though they were not, like the clients, bound to\r\nhave a patronus. They continued to have their own sacra, which\r\nthey had had before the conquest, but these were regulated by the\r\npatrician pontiffs. Lastly, they were free land-owners, and had\r\ntheir own gentes.--The population of the Roman state thus consisted\r\nof two opposite elements; a ruling class or an aristocracy, and the\r\ncommonalty, which, though of the same stock as the noblest among\r\nthe rulers, and exceeding them in numbers, yet enjoyed none of the\r\nrights which might enable them to take a part in the management of\r\npublic affairs, religious or civil. Their citizenship resembled the\r\nrelation of aliens to a state, in which they are merely tolerated on\r\ncondition of performing certain services, and they are, in fact,\r\nsometimes called peregrini. That such a state of things could not\r\nlast, is a truth which must have been felt by every one who was not\r\nblinded by his own selfishness and love of dominion. Tarquinius\r\nPriscus was the first who conceived the idea of placing the plebeians\r\non a footing of equality with the old burghers, by dividing them\r\ninto three tribes, which he intended to call after his own name and\r\nthose of his friends. But this noble plan was frustrated by the\r\nopposition of the augur Attus Navius, who probably acted the part\r\nof a representative of the patricians. All that Tarquinius could do\r\nwas to effect the admission of the noblest plebeian families into\r\nthe three old tribes, who were distinguished from the old patrician\r\nfamilies by the names of Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres secundi, and\r\ntheir gentes are sometimes distinguished by the epithet minores,\r\nas they entered into the same relation in which the Luceres had\r\nbeen to the first two tribes, before the time of Tarquinius. It\r\nwas reserved to his successor, Servius Tullius, to give to the\r\ncommonalty a regular internal organisation, and to determine their\r\nrelations to the patricians. He first divided the city into four, and\r\nthen the subject country around, which was inhabited by plebeians,\r\ninto twenty-six regions or local tribes, and in these regions he\r\nassigned lots of land to those plebeians who were yet without landed\r\nproperty. [TRIBUS.] Each tribe had its praefect, called tribunus. The\r\ntribes had also their own sacra, festivals, and meetings (_comitia\r\ntributa_), which were convoked by their tribunes. This division into\r\ntribes with tribunes at their heads was no more than an internal\r\norganisation of the plebeians, analogous to the division of the\r\npatricians into thirty curiae, without conferring upon them the right\r\nto interfere in any way in the management of public affairs, or in\r\nthe elections, which were left entirely to the senate and the curiae.\r\nThese rights, however, they obtained by another regulation of Servius\r\nTullius, which was made wholly independent of the thirty tribes. For\r\nthis purpose he instituted a census, and divided the whole body of\r\nRoman citizens, plebeians as well as patricians, into five classes,\r\naccording to the amount of their property. Taxation and the military\r\nduties were arranged according to these classes in such a manner,\r\nthat the heavier burdens fell upon the wealthier classes. The whole\r\nbody of citizens thus divided was formed into a great national\r\nassembly called comitiatus maximus, or comitia centuriata. [COMITIA.]\r\nIn this assembly the plebeians now met the patricians apparently on\r\na footing of equality, but the votes were distributed in such a way\r\nthat it was always in the power of the wealthiest classes, to which\r\nthe patricians naturally belonged, to decide a question before it\r\nwas put to the vote of the poorer classes. A great number of such\r\nnoble plebeian families, as after the subjugation of the Latin towns\r\nhad not been admitted into the curies by Tarquinius Priscus, were\r\nnow constituted by Servius into a number of equites, with twelve\r\nsuffragia in the comitia centuriata. [EQUITES.] In this constitution,\r\nthe plebeians, as such, did not obtain admission to the senate, nor\r\nto the highest magistracy, nor to any of the priestly offices. To\r\nall these offices the patricians alone thought themselves entitled\r\nby divine right. The plebeians also continued to be excluded from\r\noccupying any portion of the public land, which as yet was possessed\r\nonly by the patricians, and they were only allowed to keep their\r\ncattle upon the common pasture.--In the early times of the republic\r\nthere was a constant struggle between the two orders, the history\r\nof which belongs to a history of Rome, and cannot be given here.\r\nEventually the plebeians gained access to all the civil and religious\r\noffices, until at last the two hostile elements became united into\r\none great body of Roman citizens with equal rights, and a state of\r\nthings arose, totally different from what had existed before. After\r\nthe first secession, in B.C. 494, the plebeians gained several great\r\nadvantages. First, a law was passed to prevent the patricians from\r\ntaking usurious interest of money, which they frequently lent to\r\nimpoverished plebeians; secondly, tribunes were appointed for the\r\nprotection of the plebeians [TRIBUNI]; and lastly, plebeian aediles\r\nwere appointed. [AEDILES.] Shortly after, they gained the right to\r\nsummon before their own comitia tributa any one who had violated the\r\nrights of their order, and to make decrees (_plebiscita_), which,\r\nhowever, did not become binding upon the whole nation, free from\r\nthe control of the curies, until the year B.C. 286. In B.C. 445,\r\nthe tribune Canuleius established, by his rogations, the connubium\r\nbetween patricians and plebeians. He also attempted to divide the\r\nconsulship between the two orders, but the patricians frustrated the\r\nrealisation of this plan by the appointment of six military tribunes,\r\nwho were to be elected from both orders. [TRIBUNI.] But that the\r\nplebeians might have no share in the censorial power, with which the\r\nconsuls had been invested, the military tribunes did not obtain that\r\npower, and a new curule dignity, the censorship, was established,\r\nwith which patricians alone were to be invested. [CENSOR.] In B.C.\r\n421 the plebeians were admitted to the quaestorship, which opened\r\nto them the way into the senate, where henceforth their number\r\ncontinued to increase. [QUAESTOR; SENATUS.] In B.C. 367 the tribunes\r\nL. Licinius Stolo and L. Sextius placed themselves at the head of the\r\ncommonalty, and resumed the contest against the patricians. After\r\na fierce struggle, which lasted for several years, they at length\r\ncarried a rogation, according to which decemvirs were to be appointed\r\nfor keeping the Sibylline books instead of duumvirs, of whom half\r\nwere to be plebeians. The next great step was the restoration of\r\nthe consulship, on condition that one consul should always be a\r\nplebeian. A third rogation of Licinius, which was only intended to\r\nafford momentary relief to the poor plebeians, regulated the rate\r\nof interest. From this time forward the plebeians also appear in\r\nthe possession of the right to occupy parts of the ager publicus.\r\nIn B.C. 366, L. Sextius Lateranus was the first plebeian consul.\r\nThe patricians, however, who always contrived to yield no more than\r\nwhat it was absolutely impossible for them to retain, stripped the\r\nconsulship of a considerable part of its power, and transferred\r\nit to two new curule offices, viz. that of praetor and of curule\r\naedile. [AEDILES; PRAETOR.] But after such great advantages had\r\nbeen once gained by the plebeians, it was impossible to stop them\r\nin their progress towards a perfect equality of political rights\r\nwith the patricians. In B.C. 356, C. Marcius Rutilus was the first\r\nplebeian dictator; in B.C. 351 the censorship was thrown open to\r\nthe plebeians, and in B.C. 336 the praetorship. The Ogulnian law,\r\nin B.C. 300, also opened to them the offices of pontifex and augur.\r\nThese advantages were, as might be supposed, not gained without the\r\nfiercest opposition of the patricians, and even after they were\r\ngained and sanctioned by law, the patricians exerted every means to\r\nobstruct the operation of the law. Such fraudulent attempts led,\r\nin B.C. 286, to the last secession of the plebeians, after which,\r\nhowever, the dictator Q. Hortensius successfully and permanently\r\nreconciled the two orders, secured to the plebeians all the rights\r\nthey had acquired until then, and procured for their plebiscita the\r\nfull power of leges binding upon the whole nation. After the passing\r\nof the Hortensian law, the political distinction between patricians\r\nand plebeians ceased, and, with a few unimportant exceptions, both\r\norders were placed on a footing of perfect equality. Henceforth\r\nthe name populus is sometimes applied to the plebeians alone, and\r\nsometimes to the whole body of Roman citizens, as assembled in the\r\ncomitia centuriata or tributa. The term plebs or plebecula, on\r\nthe other hand, was applied, in a loose manner of speaking, to the\r\nmultitude or populace, in opposition to the nobiles or the senatorial\r\nparty.--A person who was born a plebeian could only be raised to\r\nthe rank of a patrician by a lex curiata, as was sometimes done\r\nduring the kingly period, and in the early times of the republic.\r\nIt frequently occurs in the history of Rome that one and the same\r\ngens contains plebeian as well as patrician families. In the gens\r\nCornelia, for instance, we find the plebeian families of the Balbi,\r\nMammulae, Merulae, &c., along with the patrician Scipiones, Sullae,\r\nLentuli, &c. The occurrence of this phenomenon may be accounted for\r\nin different ways. It may have been, that one branch of a plebeian\r\nfamily was made patrician while the others remained plebeians. It may\r\nalso have happened that two families had the same nomen gentilicium\r\nwithout being actual members of the same gens. Again, a patrician\r\nfamily might go over to the plebeians, and as such a family continued\r\nto bear the name of its patrician gens, this gens apparently\r\ncontained a plebeian family. When a peregrinus obtained the civitas\r\nthrough the influence of a patrician, or when a slave was emancipated\r\nby his patrician master, they generally adopted the nomen gentilicium\r\nof their benefactor, and thus appear to belong to the same gens with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLĒBISCĪTUM, a name properly applied to a law passed at the comitia\r\ntributa on the rogation of a tribune. Originally, a plebiscitum\r\nrequired confirmation by the comitia curiata and the senate; but a\r\nLex Hortensia was passed B.C. 286, to the effect that plebiscita\r\nshould bind all the populus (_universus populus_), and this lex\r\nrendered confirmation unnecessary. The Lex Hortensia is always\r\nreferred to as the lex which put plebiscita as to their binding force\r\nexactly on the same footing as leges. The principal plebiscita are\r\nmentioned under the article LEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLECTRUM. [LYRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLETHRON (πλέθρον), the fundamental land measure in the Greek system,\r\nbeing the square of 100 feet, that is, 10,000 square feet. The later\r\nGreek writers use it as the translation of the Roman _jugerum_,\r\nprobably because the latter was the standard land measure in the\r\nRoman system; but, in size, the _plethron_ answered more nearly to\r\nthe Roman _actus_, or half-jugerum, which was the older unit of land\r\nmeasures. As frequently happened with the ancient land measures,\r\nthe side of the _plethron_ was taken as a measure of length, with\r\nthe same name. This _plethron_ was equal to 100 feet (or about\r\n101 English feet) = 66⅔ πήχεις = 10 ἄκαιναι or κάλαμοι. It was also\r\nintroduced into the system of itinerary measures, being 1-6th of the\r\n_stadium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLŬTĔUS, was applied in military affairs to two different objects.\r\n(1) A kind of shed made of hurdles, and covered with raw hides, which\r\ncould be moved forward by small wheels attached to it, and under\r\nwhich the besiegers of a town made their approaches. (2) Boards or\r\nplanks placed on the vallum of a camp, on moveable towers or other\r\nmilitary engines, as a kind of roof or covering for the protection of\r\nthe soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLYNTĒRĬA (πλυντήρια, from πλύνειν, to wash), a festival celebrated\r\nat Athens every year, on the 25th of Thargelion, in honour of Athena,\r\nsurnamed Aglauros, whose temple stood on the Acropolis. The day of\r\nthis festival was at Athens among the ἀποφράδες or _dies nefasti_;\r\nfor the temple of the goddess was surrounded by a rope to preclude\r\nall communication with it; her statue was stripped of its garments\r\nand ornaments for the purpose of cleaning them, and was in the\r\nmeanwhile covered over, to conceal it from the sight of man. The\r\ncity was therefore, so to speak, on this day without its protecting\r\ndivinity, and any undertaking commenced on it was believed to be\r\nnecessarily unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNYX. [ECCLESIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPŌCŬLUM, any kind of drinking-cup, to be distinguished from the\r\n_Crater_ or vessel in which the wine was mixed [CRATER], and from the\r\n_Cyathus_, a kind of ladle or small cup, used to convey the wine from\r\nthe Crater to the Poculum or drinking-cup.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŎDĬUM. [AMPHITHEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOENA (ποινή), a general name for any punishment of any offence.\r\nMulta is the penalty of a particular offence. A Poena was only\r\ninflicted when it was imposed by some lex or some other legal\r\nauthority (_quo alio jure_). When no poena was imposed, then a multa\r\nor penalty might be inflicted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŎLĔMARCHUS (πολέμαρχος). Respecting the polemarchus at Athens,\r\nsee ARCHON. We read also of polemarchs at Sparta, and in various\r\ncities of Boeotia. As their name denotes, they were originally and\r\nproperly connected with military affairs, being entrusted either\r\nwith the command of armies abroad, or the superintendence of the war\r\ndepartment at home; sometimes with both. The polemarchs of Sparta\r\nappear to have ranked next to the king, when on actual service\r\nabroad, and were generally of the royal kindred or house (γένος).\r\nThey commanded single morae, so that they would appear to have been\r\nsix in number, and sometimes whole armies. They also formed part of\r\nthe king’s council in war, and of the royal escort called _damosia_.\r\nAt Thebes there appear to have been two polemarchs, perhaps elected,\r\nannually; and in times of peace they seem to have been invested with\r\nthe chief executive power of the state, and the command of the city,\r\nhaving its military force under their orders. They are not, however,\r\nto be confounded with the Boeotarchs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŌLĒTAE (πωλῆται), a board of ten officers, or magistrates, whose\r\nduty it was to grant leases of the public lands and mines, and also\r\nto let the revenues arising from the customs, taxes, confiscations,\r\nand forfeitures. Of such letting the word πωλεῖν (not μισθοῦν) was\r\ngenerally used, and also the correlative words ὠνεῖσθαι and πρίασθαι.\r\nOne was chosen from each tribe. In the letting of the revenue they\r\nwere assisted by the managers of the theoric fund (τὸ θεωρικόν), and\r\nthey acted under the authority of the senate of Five Hundred, who\r\nexercised a general control over the financial department of the\r\nadministration. Resident aliens, who did not pay their residence\r\ntax (μετοίκιον), were summoned before them, and, if found to have\r\ncommitted default, were sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLINCTŌRES. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPŌMOĒRĬUM. This word is compounded of _post_ and _moerium_ (_murus_),\r\nin the same manner as _pomeridiem_ of _post_ and _meridiem_, and thus\r\nsignifies a line running by the walls of a town (_pone_ or _post\r\nmuros_). But the walls of a town here spoken of are not its actual\r\nwalls or fortifications, but symbolical walls, and the course of the\r\npomoerium itself was marked by stone pillars, erected at certain\r\nintervals. The sacred line of the Roman pomoerium did not prevent the\r\ninhabitants from building upon or taking into use any place beyond\r\nit, but it was necessary to leave a certain space on each side of it\r\nunoccupied, so as not to unhallow it by profane use. Thus we find\r\nthat the Aventine, although inhabited from early times, was for many\r\ncenturies not included within the pomoerium. The pomoerium was not\r\nthe same at all times; as the city increased the pomoerium also was\r\nextended; but this extension could, according to ancient usage, only\r\nbe made by such men as had by their victories over foreign nations\r\nincreased the boundaries of the empire, and neither could a pomoerium\r\nbe formed nor altered without the augurs previously consulting the\r\nwill of the gods by augury: hence the _jus pomoerii_ of the augurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMPA (πομπή), a solemn procession, as on the occasion of a funeral,\r\ntriumph, &c. It is, however, more particularly applied to the grand\r\nprocession with which the games of the circus commenced (_Pompa\r\nCircensis_). [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPONS (γέφυρα), a bridge. As the rivers of Greece were small, and\r\nthe use of the arch known to them only to a limited extent, it is\r\nprobable that the Greek bridges were built entirely of wood, or,\r\nat best, were nothing more than a wooden platform supported upon\r\nstone piers at each extremity. Pliny mentions a bridge over the\r\nAcheron 1000 feet in length; we also know that the island Euboea was\r\njoined to Boeotia by a bridge; but the only existing specimen of a\r\nGreek bridge is the one over a tributary of the Eurotas. The Romans\r\nregularly applied the arch to the construction of bridges, by which\r\nthey were enabled to erect structures of great beauty and solidity,\r\nas well as utility. The width of the passage-way in a Roman bridge\r\nwas commonly narrow, as compared with modern structures of the same\r\nkind, and corresponded with the road (_via_) leading to and from\r\nit. It was divided into three parts. The centre one, for horses\r\nand carriages, was denominated _agger_ or _iter_; and the raised\r\nfootpaths on each side _decursoria_, which were enclosed by parapet\r\nwalls similar in use and appearance to the _pluteus_ in the basilica.\r\nThere were eight bridges across the Tiber. I. Of these the most\r\ncelebrated, as well as the most ancient, was the PONS SUBLICIUS, so\r\ncalled because it was built of wood; _sublices_, in the language of\r\nthe Formiani, meaning wooden beams. It was built by Ancus Martius,\r\nwhen he united the Janiculum to the city, and was situated at the\r\nfoot of the Aventine.--II. PONS PALATINUS formed the communication\r\nbetween the Palatine and its vicinities and the Janiculum.--III. IV.\r\n_Pons Fabricius_ and PONS CESTIUS were the two which connected the\r\nInsula Tiberina with the opposite sides of the river; the first with\r\nthe city, and the latter with the Janiculum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pons Cestius, and Pons Fabricius, at Rome, with the\r\nbuildings between restored.]\r\n\r\nBoth are still remaining. They are represented in the preceding\r\nwoodcut: that on the right hand is the pons Fabricius, and that on\r\nthe left the pons Cestius.--V. PONS JANICULENSIS, which led direct to\r\nthe Janiculum.--VI. PONS VATICANUS, so called because it formed the\r\ncommunication between the Campus Martius and Campus Vaticanus.--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pons Aelius at Rome.]\r\n\r\nVII. PONS AELIUS, built by Hadrian, which led from the city to\r\nthe mausoleum of that emperor, now the bridge and castle of St.\r\nAngelo.--VIII. PONS MILVIUS, on the Via Flaminia, now Ponte Molle,\r\nwas built by Aemilius Scaurus the censor.--The Roman bridges without\r\nthe city were too many to be enumerated here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bridge at Arimmum.]\r\n\r\nThey formed one of the chief embellishments in all the public roads;\r\nand their frequent and stupendous remains, still existing in Italy,\r\nPortugal, and Spain, attest, even to the present day, the scale of\r\ngrandeur with which the Roman works of national utility were always\r\ncarried on.--When the comitia were held, the voters, in order to\r\nreach the enclosure called _septum_ and _ovile_, passed over a\r\nwooden platform, elevated above the ground, which was called _pons\r\nsuffragiorum_, in order that they might be able to give their votes\r\nwithout confusion or collusion. [COMITIA.] _Pons_ is also used to\r\nsignify the platform (ἐπιβάθρα, ἀποβάθρα), used for embarking in, or\r\ndisembarking from, a ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nPONTĬFEX (ἱεροδιδάσκαλος, ἱερονόμος, ἱεροφύλαξ, ἱεροφάντης). The\r\norigin of this word is explained in various ways; but it is probably\r\nformed from _pons_ and _facere_ (in the signification of the Greek\r\nῥέζειν, to perform a sacrifice), and consequently signifies the\r\npriests who offered sacrifices upon the bridge. The ancient sacrifice\r\nto which the name thus alludes, is that of the Argei on the sacred\r\nor sublician bridge. [ARGEI.] The Roman pontiffs formed the most\r\nillustrious among the great colleges of priests. Their institution,\r\nlike that of all important matters of religion, was ascribed to\r\nNuma. The number of pontiffs appointed by this king was four, and at\r\ntheir head was the pontifex maximus, who is generally not included\r\nwhen the number of pontiffs is mentioned. It is probable that the\r\noriginal number of four pontiffs (not including the pontifex maximus)\r\nhad reference to the two earliest tribes of the Romans, the Ramnes\r\nand Tities, so that each tribe was represented by two pontiffs. In\r\nthe year B.C. 300 the Ogulnian law raised the number of pontiffs to\r\neight, or, including the pontifex maximus, to nine, and four of them\r\nwere to be plebeians. The pontifex maximus, however, continued to\r\nbe a patrician down to the year B.C. 254, when Tib. Coruncanius was\r\nthe first plebeian who was invested with this dignity. This number\r\nof pontiffs remained for a long time unaltered, until in B.C. 81 the\r\ndictator Sulla increased it to fifteen, and J. Caesar to sixteen. In\r\nboth these changes the pontifex maximus is included in the number.\r\nDuring the empire the number varied, though on the whole fifteen\r\nappears to have been the regular number. The mode of appointing the\r\npontiffs was also different at different times. It appears that after\r\ntheir institution by Numa, the college had the right of co-optation,\r\nthat is, if a member of the college died (for all the pontiffs held\r\ntheir office for life), the members met and elected a successor, who,\r\nafter his election, was inaugurated by the augurs. This election was\r\nsometimes called _captio_. In B.C. 104 a Lex Domitia was passed,\r\nwhich transferred the right of electing the members of the great\r\ncolleges of priests to the people (probably in the comitia tributa);\r\nthat is, the people elected a candidate, who was then made a member\r\nof the college by the co-optatio of the priests themselves, so that\r\nthe co-optatio, although still necessary, became a mere matter of\r\nform. The Lex Domitia was repealed by Sulla in a Lex Cornelia de\r\nSacerdotiis (B.C. 81), which restored to the great priestly colleges\r\ntheir full right of co-optatio. In B.C. 63 the law of Sulla was\r\nabolished, and the Domitian law was restored, but not in its full\r\nextent; for it was now determined, that in case of a vacancy the\r\ncollege itself should nominate two candidates, and the people elect\r\none of them. M. Antonius again restored the right of co-optatio to\r\nthe college. The college of pontiffs had the supreme superintendence\r\nof all matters of religion, and of things and persons connected with\r\npublic as well as private worship. They had the judicial decision\r\nin all matters of religion, whether private persons, magistrates,\r\nor priests were concerned, and in cases where the existing laws or\r\ncustoms were found defective or insufficient, they made new laws and\r\nregulations (_decreta pontificum_), in which they always followed\r\ntheir own judgment as to what was consistent with the existing\r\ncustoms and usages. The details of these duties and functions were\r\ncontained in books called _libri pontificii_ or _pontificales_,\r\n_commentarii sacrorum_ or _sacrorum pontificalium_, which they were\r\nsaid to have received from Numa, and which were sanctioned by Ancus\r\nMartius. As to the rights and duties of the pontiffs, it must first\r\nof all be borne in mind, that the pontiffs were not priests of any\r\nparticular divinity, but a college which stood above all other\r\npriests, and superintended the whole external worship of the gods.\r\nOne of their principal duties was the regulation of the sacra, both\r\npublica and privata, and to watch that they were observed at the\r\nproper times (for which purpose the pontiffs had the whole regulation\r\nof the calendar, see CALENDARIUM), and in their proper form. In the\r\nmanagement of the sacra publica they were in later times assisted in\r\ncertain duties by the Triumviri Epulones. [EPULONES.] The pontiffs\r\nconvoked the assembly of the curies (_comitia calata_ or _curiata_)\r\nin cases where priests were to be appointed, and flamines or a\r\nrex sacrorum were to be inaugurated; also when wills were to be\r\nreceived, and when a detestatio sacrorum and adoption by adrogatio\r\ntook place. [ADOPTIO.] In most cases the sentence of the pontiffs\r\nonly inflicted a fine upon the offenders; but the person fined had\r\nthe right of appealing to the people, who might release him from the\r\nfine. In regard to the vestal virgins, and the persons who committed\r\nincest with them, the pontiffs had criminal jurisdiction, and might\r\npronounce sentence of death. A man who had violated a vestal virgin\r\nwas, according to an ancient law, scourged to death by the pontifex\r\nmaximus in the comitium, and it appears that originally neither the\r\nvestal virgins nor the male offenders in such a case had any right\r\nof appeal. In later times we find that, even when the pontiffs had\r\npassed sentence upon vestal virgins, a tribune interfered, and\r\ninduced the people to appoint a quaestor for the purpose of making\r\na fresh inquiry into the case; and it sometimes happened that after\r\nthis new trial the sentence of the pontiffs was modified or annulled.\r\nSuch cases, however, seem to have been mere irregularities, founded\r\nupon an abuse of the tribunitian power. In the early times the\r\npontiffs were in the exclusive possession of the civil as well as\r\nreligious law, until the former was made public by Cn. Flavius. The\r\nregulations which served as a guide to the pontiffs in their judicial\r\nproceedings, formed a large collection of laws, which was called\r\nthe _jus pontificium_, and formed part of the Libri Pontificii. The\r\nmeetings of the college of pontiffs, to which in some instances the\r\nfamines and the rex sacrorum were summoned, were held in the curia\r\nregia on the Via Sacra, to which was attached the residence of the\r\npontifex maximus and of the rex sacrorum. As the chief pontiff was\r\nobliged to live in a domus publica, Augustus, when he assumed this\r\ndignity, changed part of his own house into a domus publica. All\r\nthe pontiffs were in their appearance distinguished by the conic\r\ncap, called tutulus or galerus, with an apex upon it, and the toga\r\npraetexta. The pontifex maximus was the president of the college, and\r\nacted in its name, whence he alone is frequently mentioned in cases\r\nin which he must be considered only as the organ of the college. He\r\nwas generally chosen from among the most distinguished persons, and\r\nsuch as had held a curule magistracy, or were already members of\r\nthe college. Two of his especial duties were to appoint (_capere_)\r\nthe vestal virgins and the flamines [VESTALES; FLAMEN], and to be\r\npresent at every marriage by confarreatio. When festive games were\r\nvowed, or a dedication made, the chief pontiff had to repeat over,\r\nbefore the persons who made the vow or the dedication, the formula\r\nin which it was to be performed (_praeire verba_). During the period\r\nof the republic, when the people exercised sovereign power in every\r\nrespect, we find that if the pontiff, on constitutional or religious\r\ngrounds, refused to perform this solemnity, he might be compelled by\r\nthe people. The pontifex maximus wrote down what occurred in his year\r\non tablets, which were hung up in his dwelling for the information of\r\nthe people, and called _Annales Maximi_. A pontifex might, like all\r\nthe members of the great priestly colleges, hold any other military,\r\ncivil, or priestly office, provided the different offices did not\r\ninterfere with one another. Thus we find one and the same person\r\nbeing pontiff, augur, and decemvir sacrorum; instances of a pontifex\r\nmaximus being at the same time consul are very numerous. But whatever\r\nmight be the civil or military office which a pontifex maximus held\r\nbeside his pontificate, he was not allowed originally to leave Italy.\r\nThe college of pontiffs continued to exist until the overthrow of\r\npaganism. The emperors themselves were always chief pontiffs, and\r\nas such the presidents of the college; hence the title of pontifex\r\nmaximus (P. M. or PON. M.) appears on several coins of the emperors.\r\nIf there were several emperors at a time, only one bore the title of\r\npontifex maximus; but in the year A.D. 238 we find that each of the\r\ntwo emperors Maximus and Balbinus assumed this dignity. From the\r\ntime of Theodosius the emperors no longer appear with the dignity of\r\npontiff; but at last the title was assumed by the Christian bishop\r\nof Rome.--There were other pontiffs at Rome, who were distinguished\r\nby the epithet _Minores_. They appear to have been originally only\r\nthe secretaries of the pontiffs; and when the real pontiffs began to\r\nneglect their duties, and to leave the principal business to be done\r\nby their secretaries, it became customary to designate these scribes\r\nby the name of Pontifices Minores. The number of these secretaries is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŎPA. [SACRIFICIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPŎPĪNA. [CAUPONA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPŬLĀRĬA. [AMPHITHEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPŎPŬLUS. [PATRICII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPŎPŬLĬFŬGĬA or POPLĬFŬGĬA, the day of the people’s flight, was\r\ncelebrated on the nones of July, according to an ancient tradition,\r\nin commemoration of the flight of the people, when the inhabitants\r\nof Ficulae, Fidenae, and other places round about, appeared in arms\r\nagainst Rome shortly after the departure of the Gauls, and produced\r\nsuch a panic that the Romans suddenly fled before them. Other writers\r\nsay that the Populifugia was celebrated in commemoration of the\r\nflight of the people before the Tuscans; while others again refer its\r\norigin to the flight of the people on the death of Romulus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŎRISTAE (πορισταί), magistrates at Athens, who probably levied the\r\nextraordinary supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTA (πύλη, _dim._ πυλίς), the gate of a city, citadel, or other\r\nopen space inclosed by a wall, in contradistinction to JANUA, which\r\nwas the door of a house or any covered edifice. The terms _porta_ and\r\nπύλη are often found in the plural, even when applied to a single\r\ngate, because it consisted of two leaves. The gates of a city were of\r\ncourse various in their number and position. Thus Megara had 5 gates;\r\nThebes, in Boeotia, had 7; Athens had 8; and Rome 20, or perhaps\r\neven more. The jambs of the gate were surmounted, 1. by a lintel,\r\nwhich was large and strong in proportion to the width of the gate.\r\n2. By an arch, as we see exemplified at Pompeii, Paestum, Sepianum,\r\nVolterra, Suza, Autun, Besançon, and Treves. 3. At Arpinum, one of\r\nthe gates now remaining is arched, whilst another is constructed with\r\nthe stones projecting one beyond another. Gates sometimes had two\r\npassages close together, the one designed for carriages entering, and\r\nthe other for carriages leaving the city. In other instances we find\r\nonly one gate for carriages, but a smaller one on each side of it\r\n(παραπυλίς) for foot-passengers. When there were no sideways, one of\r\nthe valves of the large gate sometimes contained a wicket (_portula_,\r\nπυλίς: ῥινοπύλη), large enough to admit a single person. The gateway\r\nhad commonly a chamber (called πυλών) either on one side or on both,\r\nwhich served as the residence of the porter or guard. Statues of\r\nthe gods were often placed near the gate, or even within it in the\r\nbarbican, so as to be ready to receive the adoration of those who\r\nentered the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTĬCUS (στοά), a walk covered with a roof, and supported by\r\ncolumns, at least on one side. Such shaded walks and places of\r\nresort are almost indispensable in the southern countries of\r\nEurope, where people live much in the open air, as a protection\r\nfrom the heat of the sun and from rain. The porticoes attached to\r\nthe temples were either constructed only in front of them, or went\r\nround the whole building, as is the case in the so-called Temple\r\nof Theseus at Athens. They were originally intended as places for\r\nthose persons to assemble and converse in who visited the temple\r\nfor various purposes. As such temple-porticoes, however, were\r\nfound too small, or not suited for the various purposes of private\r\nand public life, most Grecian towns had independent porticoes,\r\nsome of which were very extensive; and in most of these _stoae_,\r\nseats (_exedrae_) were placed, that those who were tired might sit\r\ndown. They were frequented not only by idle loungers, but also by\r\nphilosophers, rhetoricians, and other persons fond of intellectual\r\nconversation. The Stoic school of philosophy derived its name from\r\nthe circumstance, that the founder of it used to converse with his\r\ndisciples in a stoa. The Romans derived their great fondness for\r\nsuch covered walks from the Greeks; and as luxuries among them were\r\ncarried in everything to a greater extent than in Greece, wealthy\r\nRomans had their private porticoes, sometimes in the city itself,\r\nand sometimes in their country-seats. In the public porticoes of\r\nRome, which were exceedingly numerous and very extensive (as those\r\naround the Forum and the Campus Martius), a variety of business was\r\noccasionally transacted: we find that law-suits were conducted here,\r\nmeetings of the senate held, goods exhibited for sale, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTISCŬLUS (κελευστής), an officer in a ship, who gave the signal\r\nto the rowers, that they might keep time in rowing. This officer is\r\nsometimes called _Hortator_ or _Pausarius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTĬTŌRES. [PUBLICANI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTŌRĬUM, a branch of the regular revenues of the Roman state,\r\nconsisting of the duties paid on imported and exported goods. A\r\nportorium, or duty upon imported goods, appears to have been paid at\r\na very early period, for it is said that Valerius Publicola exempted\r\nthe plebes from the portoria at the time when the republic was\r\nthreatened with an invasion by Porsena. The time of its introduction\r\nis uncertain; but the abolition of it, ascribed to Publicola, can\r\nonly have been a temporary measure; and as the expenditure of the\r\nrepublic increased, new portoria must have been introduced. In\r\nconquered places, and in the provinces, the import and export duties,\r\nwhich had been paid there before, were generally not only retained,\r\nbut increased, and appropriated to the aerarium. Sicily, and above\r\nall, Asia, furnished to the Roman treasury large sums, which were\r\nraised as portoria. In B.C. 60 all the portoria in the ports of Italy\r\nwere done away with by a Lex Caecilia, but were restored by Julius\r\nCaesar and the subsequent emperors. Respecting the amount of the\r\nimport or export duties we have but little information. In the time\r\nof Cicero the portorium in the ports of Sicily was one-twentieth\r\n(_vicesima_) of the value of taxable articles; and it is probable\r\nthat this was the average sum raised in all the other provinces.\r\nIn the times of the emperors the ordinary rate of the portorium\r\nappears to have been the fortieth part (_quadragesima_) of the value\r\nof imported goods; and at a later period the exorbitant sum of\r\none-eighth (_octava_) is mentioned. The portorium was, like all other\r\nvectigalia, farmed out by the censors to the publicani, who collected\r\nit through the _portitores_. [VECTIGALIA; PUBLICANI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSESSĬO. [AGER PUBLICUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTĪCUM. [JANUA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTLĪMĬNĬUM, POSTLĪMĬNII JUS. If a Roman citizen during war came\r\ninto the possession of an enemy, he sustained a _diminutio capitis\r\nmaxima_ [CAPUT], and all his civil rights were in abeyance. Being\r\ncaptured by the enemy, he became a slave; but his rights over his\r\nchildren, if he had any, were not destroyed, but were said to be in\r\nabeyance (_pendere_) by virtue of the _Jus Postliminii_: when he\r\nreturned, his children were again in his power; and if he died in\r\ncaptivity, they became sui juris. Sometimes by an act of the state\r\na man was given up bound to an enemy, and if the enemy would not\r\nreceive him, it was a question whether he had the Jus Postliminii.\r\nThis was the case with Sp. Postumius, who was given up to the\r\nSamnites, and with C. Hostilius Mancinus, who was given up to the\r\nNumantines; but the better opinion was, that they had no _Jus\r\nPostliminii_, and Mancinus was restored to his civic rights by a lex.\r\nIt appears that the Jus Postliminii was founded on the fiction of the\r\ncaptive having never been absent from home; a fiction which was of\r\neasy application, for, as the captive during his absence could not\r\ndo any legal act, the interval of captivity was a period of legal\r\nnon-activity, which was terminated by his showing himself again.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŎTESTAS. [PATRIA POTESTAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTŎRES (πράκτορες), subordinate officers at Athens, who collected\r\nthe fines and penalties (ἐπιβολάς and τιμήματα) imposed by\r\nmagistrates and courts of justice, and payable to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAECINCTĬO. [AMPHITHEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAECŌNES, criers, were employed for various purposes: 1. In\r\nsales by auction, they frequently advertised the time, place, and\r\nconditions of sale: they seem also to have acted the part of the\r\nmodern auctioneer, so far as calling out the biddings and amusing\r\nthe company, though the property was knocked down by the _magister\r\nauctionis_. [AUCTIO.] 2. In all public assemblies they ordered\r\nsilence. 3. In the comitia they called the centuries one by one to\r\ngive their votes, pronounced the vote of each century, and called\r\nout the names of those who were elected. They also recited the laws\r\nthat were to be passed. 4. In trials, they summoned the accuser and\r\nthe accused, the plaintiff and defendant. 5. In the public games,\r\nthey invited the people to attend, and proclaimed the victors. 6.\r\nIn solemn funerals they also invited people to attend by a certain\r\nform; hence these funerals were called _funera indictiva_. 7. When\r\nthings were lost, they cried them and searched for them. 8. In\r\nthe infliction of capital punishment, they sometimes conveyed the\r\ncommands of the magistrates to the lictors. Their office, called\r\n_Praeconium_, appears to have been regarded as rather disreputable:\r\nin the time of Cicero a law was passed preventing all persons who\r\nhad been praecones from becoming decuriones in the municipia. Under\r\nthe early emperors, however, it became very profitable, which was no\r\ndoubt partly owing to fees, to which they were entitled in the courts\r\nof justice, and partly to the bribes which they received from the\r\nsuitors, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEDA signifies moveable things taken by an enemy in war. Such\r\nthings were either distributed by the Imperator among the soldiers or\r\nsold by the quaestors, and the produce was brought into the Aerarium.\r\nThe difference between Praeda and Manubiae is this:--Praeda is the\r\nthings themselves that are taken in war, and Manubiae is the money\r\nrealized by their sale. It was the practice to set up a spear at\r\nsuch sales, which was afterwards used at all sales of things by a\r\nmagistrates in the name of the people. [SECTIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTŪRA. [COLONIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS AERĀRĬI. [AERARIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS ANNŌNAE, the praefect of the provisions, especially of the\r\ncorn-market, was not a regular magistrate under the republic, but\r\nwas only appointed in cases of extraordinary scarcity, when he seems\r\nto have regulated the prices at which corn was to be sold. Augustus\r\ncreated an officer under the title of _Praefectus Annonae_, who had\r\njurisdiction over all matters appertaining to the corn-market, and,\r\nlike the _Praefectus Vigilum_, was chosen from the equites, and was\r\nnot reckoned among the ordinary magistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS ĂQUĀRUM. [AQUAE DUCTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS CASTRŌRUM, praefect of the camp, is first mentioned in the\r\nreign of Augustus. There was one to each legion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS CLASSIS, the commander of a fleet. This title was\r\nfrequently given in the times of the republic to the commander of a\r\nfleet; but Augustus appointed two permanent officers with this title,\r\none of whom was stationed at Ravenna on the Adriatic, and the other\r\nat Misenum on the Tuscan sea, each having the command of a fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS FABRUM. [FABRI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS JŪRI DĪCUNDO. [COLONIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS LĔGĬŌNIS. [EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS PRAETŌRĬO, was the commander of the troops who guarded\r\nthe emperor’s person. [PRAETORIANI.] This office was instituted by\r\nAugustus, and was at first only military, and had comparatively\r\nsmall power attached to it; but under Tiberius, who made Sejanus\r\ncommander of the praetorian troops, it became of much greater\r\nimportance, till at length the power of these praefects became only\r\nsecond to that of the emperors. From the reign of Severus to that\r\nof Diocletian, the praefects, like the vizirs of the east, had the\r\nsuperintendence of all departments of the state, the palace, the\r\narmy, the finances, and the law: they also had a court in which\r\nthey decided cases. The office of praefect of the praetorium was\r\nnot confined to military officers; it was filled by Ulpian and\r\nPapinian, and other distinguished jurists. Originally there were two\r\npraefects; afterwards sometimes one and sometimes two; from the time\r\nof Commodus sometimes three, and even four. They were, as a regular\r\nrule, chosen only from the equites; but from the time of Alexander\r\nSeverus the dignity of senator was always joined with their office.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS VĬGĬLUM. [EXERCITUS, p. 171, _a_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFECTUS URBI, praefect or warden of the city, was originally\r\ncalled _Custos Urbis_. The name _praefectus urbi_ does not seem to\r\nhave been used till after the time of the decemvirs. The dignity of\r\n_custos urbis_, being combined with that of _princeps senatus_, was\r\nconferred by the king, as he had to appoint one of the decem primi as\r\nprinceps senatus. The functions of the _custos urbis_, however, were\r\nnot exercised except in the absence of the king from Rome; and then\r\nhe acted as the representative of the king: he convoked the senate,\r\nheld the comitia, if necessary, and on any emergency, might take\r\nsuch measures as he thought proper; in short, he had the imperium in\r\nthe city. During the kingly period, the office of _custos urbis_ was\r\nprobably for life. Under the republic, the office, and its name of\r\n_custos urbis_, remained unaltered; but in B.C. 487 it was elevated\r\ninto a magistracy, to be bestowed by election. The _custos urbis_\r\nwas, in all probability, elected by the curiae. Persons of consular\r\nrank were alone eligible. In the early period of the republic the\r\n_custos urbis_ exercised within the city all the powers of the\r\nconsuls, if they were absent: he convoked the senate, held the\r\ncomitia, and, in times of war, even levied civic legions, which were\r\ncommanded by him. When the office of praetor urbanus was instituted,\r\nthe wardenship of the city was swallowed up in it; but as the Romans\r\nwere at all times averse to dropping altogether any of their old\r\ninstitutions, a praefectus urbi, though a mere shadow of the former\r\noffice, was henceforth appointed every year, only for the time that\r\nthe consuls were absent from Rome for the purpose of celebrating the\r\nFeriae Latinae. This praefectus had neither the power of convoking\r\nthe senate nor the right of speaking in it; in most cases he was a\r\nperson below the senatorial age, and was not appointed by the people,\r\nbut by the consuls. An office very different from this, though\r\nbearing the same name, was instituted by Augustus on the suggestion\r\nof Maecenas. This new praefectus urbi was a regular and permanent\r\nmagistrate, whom Augustus invested with all the powers necessary to\r\nmaintain peace and order in the city. He had the superintendence of\r\nbutchers, bankers, guardians, theatres, &c.; and to enable him to\r\nexercise his power, he had distributed throughout the city a number\r\nof milites stationarii, whom we may compare to a modern police. His\r\njurisdiction, however, became gradually extended; and as the powers\r\nof the ancient republican praefectus urbi had been swallowed up by\r\nthe office of the praetor urbanus, so now the power of the praetor\r\nurbanus was gradually absorbed by that of the praefectus urbi; and at\r\nlast there was no appeal from his sentence, except to the person of\r\nthe princeps himself, while any body might appeal from the sentence\r\nof any other city magistrate, and, at a later period, even from that\r\nof a governor of a province, to the tribunal of the praefectus urbi.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEFĬCAE. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAEJŪDĬCĬUM is used both in the sense of a precedent, in which case\r\nit is rather _exemplum_ than _praejudicium_ (_res ex paribus causis\r\njudicatae_); and also in the sense of a preliminary inquiry and\r\ndetermination about something which belongs to the matter in dispute\r\n(_judiciis ad ipsam causam pertinentibus_), from whence also comes\r\nthe name Praejudicium.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAELŪSĬO.

The goods of a\r\nPraes were called _Praedia_. The _Praediator_ was a person who bought\r\na _praedium_, that is, a thing given to the state as a security by a\r\npraes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAESCRIPTĬO, or rather TEMPŎRIS PRAESCRIPTĬO, signifies the Exceptio\r\nor answer which a defendant has to the demand of a plaintiff, founded\r\non the circumstance of the lapse of time. The word has properly no\r\nreference to the plaintiff’s loss of right, but to the defendant’s\r\nacquisition of a right by which he excludes the plaintiff from\r\nprosecuting his suit. This right of a defendant did not exist in the\r\nold Roman law.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAESES. [PROVINCIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAESUL. [SALII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAETEXTA. [TOGA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAETOR (στρατηγός), was originally a title which designated the\r\nconsuls as the leaders of the armies of the state. The period\r\nand office of the command of the consuls might appropriately be\r\ncalled _Praetorium_. Praetor was also a title of office among the\r\nLatins. The first praetor specially so called was appointed in B.C.\r\n366, and he was chosen only from the patricians, who had this new\r\noffice created as a kind of indemnification to themselves for being\r\ncompelled to share the consulship with the plebeians. No plebeian\r\npraetor was appointed till the year B.C. 337. The praetor was called\r\n_collega consulibus_, and was elected with the same auspices at the\r\ncomitia centuriata. The praetorship was originally a kind of third\r\nconsulship, and the chief functions of the praetor (_jus in urbe\r\ndicere_, _jura reddere_) were a portion of the functions of the\r\nconsuls. The praetor sometimes commanded the armies of the state; and\r\nwhile the consuls were absent with the armies, he exercised their\r\nfunctions within the city. He was a magistratus curulis, and he had\r\nthe imperium, and consequently was one of the magistratus majores:\r\nbut he owed respect and obedience to the consuls. His insignia of\r\noffice were six lictors; but at a later period he had only two\r\nlictors in Rome. The praetorship was at first given to a consul of\r\nthe preceding year.--In B.C. 246 another praetor was appointed, whose\r\nbusiness was to administer justice in matters in dispute between\r\nperegrini, or peregrini and Roman citizens; and accordingly he was\r\ncalled _praetor peregrinus_. The other praetor was then called\r\n_praetor urbanus, qui jus inter cives dicit_, and sometimes simply\r\n_praetor urbanus_ and _praetor urbis_. The two praetors determined by\r\nlot which functions they should respectively exercise. If either of\r\nthem was at the head of the army, the other performed all the duties\r\nof both within the city. Sometimes the military imperium of a praetor\r\nwas prolonged for a second year. When the territories of the state\r\nwere extended beyond the limits of Italy, new praetors were made.\r\nThus, two praetors were created B.C. 227, for the administration of\r\nSicily and Sardinia, and two more were added when the two Spanish\r\nprovinces were formed, B.C. 197. When there were six praetors, two\r\nstayed in the city, and the other four went abroad. The senate\r\ndetermined their provinces, which were distributed among them by\r\nlot. After the discharge of his judicial functions in the city, a\r\npraetor often had the administration of a province, with the title\r\nof _propraetor_. Sulla increased the number of praetors to eight,\r\nwhich Julius Caesar raised successively to ten, twelve, fourteen,\r\nand sixteen. Augustus, after several changes, fixed the number\r\nat twelve. Under Tiberius there were sixteen. Two praetors were\r\nappointed by Claudius for matters relating to fideicommissa, when\r\nthe business in this department of the law had become considerable,\r\nbut Titus reduced the number to one; and Nerva added a praetor for\r\nthe decision of matters between the fiscus and individuals. Thus\r\nthere were eventually eighteen praetors, who administered justice\r\nin the state.--The praetor urbanus was specially named praetor, and\r\nhe was the first in rank. His duties confined him to Rome, as is\r\nimplied by the name, and he could only leave the city for ten days at\r\na time. It was part of his duty to superintend the Ludi Apollinares.\r\nHe was also the chief magistrate for the administration of justice;\r\nand to the edicta of the successive praetors the Roman law owes in\r\na great degree its development and improvement. Both the praetor\r\nurbanus and the praetor peregrinus had the jus edicendi, and their\r\nfunctions in this respect do not appear to have been limited on\r\nthe establishment of the imperial power, though it must have been\r\ngradually restricted, as the practice of imperial constitutions and\r\nrescripts became common. [EDICTUM.] The chief judicial functions of\r\nthe praetor in civil matters consisted in giving a judex. [JUDEX.] It\r\nwas only in the case of interdicts that he decided in a summary way.\r\n[INTERDICTUM.] Proceedings before the praetor were technically said\r\nto be _in jure_. The praetors also presided at trials of criminal\r\nmatters. These were the quaestiones perpetuae, or the trials for\r\nrepetundae, ambitus, majestas, and peculatus, which, when there were\r\nsix praetors, were assigned to four out of the number. Sulla added\r\nto these quaestiones those of falsum, de sicariis et veneficis, and\r\nde parricidis, and for this purpose he added two, or, according\r\nto some accounts, four praetors. On these occasions the praetor\r\npresided, but a body of judices determined by a majority of votes the\r\ncondemnation or acquittal of the accused. [JUDEX.] The praetor, when\r\nhe administered justice, sat on a sella curulis in a tribunal, which\r\nwas that part of the court which was appropriated to the praetor and\r\nhis assessors and friends, and is opposed to the subsellia, or part\r\noccupied by the judices, and others who were present.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAETŌRĬA CŎHORS. [PRAETORIANI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAETŌRĬĀNI, sc. _milites_, or _praetoriae cohortes_, a body of\r\ntroops instituted by Augustus to protect his person and his power,\r\nand called by that name in imitation of the _praetoria cohors_, or\r\nselect troops which attended the person of the praetor or general of\r\nthe Roman army. They originally consisted of nine or ten cohorts,\r\neach comprising a thousand men, horse and foot. Augustus, in\r\naccordance with his general policy of avoiding the appearance of\r\ndespotism, stationed only three of these cohorts in the capital, and\r\ndispersed the remainder in the adjacent towns of Italy. Tiberius,\r\nhowever, under pretence of introducing a stricter discipline among\r\nthem, assembled them all at Rome in a permanent camp, which was\r\nstrongly fortified. Their number was increased by Vitellius to\r\nsixteen cohorts, or 16,000 men. The praetorians were distinguished\r\nby double pay and especial privileges. Their term of service was\r\noriginally fixed by Augustus at twelve years, but was afterwards\r\nincreased to sixteen years; and when they had served their time, each\r\nsoldier received 20,000 sesterces. They soon became the most powerful\r\nbody in the state, and, like the janissaries at Constantinople,\r\nfrequently deposed and elevated emperors according to their pleasure.\r\nEven the most powerful of the emperors were obliged to court their\r\nfavour; and they always obtained a liberal donation upon the\r\naccession of each sovereign. After the death of Pertinax (A.D. 193)\r\nthey even offered the empire for sale, which was purchased by Didius\r\nJulianus; but upon the accession of Severus in the same year they\r\nwere disbanded, on account of the part they had taken in the death\r\nof Pertinax, and banished from the city. The emperors, however,\r\ncould not dispense with guards, and accordingly the praetorians were\r\nrestored on a new model by Severus, and increased to four times their\r\nancient number. Diocletian reduced their numbers and abolished their\r\nprivileges; they were still allowed to remain at Rome, but had no\r\nlonger the guard of the emperor’s person, as he never resided in the\r\ncapital. Their numbers were again increased by Maxentius; but after\r\nhis defeat by Constantine, A.D. 312, they were entirely suppressed\r\nby the latter, their fortified camp destroyed, and those who had\r\nnot perished in the battle between Constantine and Maxentius were\r\ndispersed among the legions. The commander of the praetorians was\r\ncalled PRAEFECTUS PRAETORIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAETŌRĬUM, the name of the general’s tent in the camp, and so\r\ncalled because the name of the chief Roman magistrate was originally\r\npraetor, and not consul. [CASTRA.] The officers who attended on the\r\ngeneral in the _praetorium_, and formed his council of war, were\r\ncalled by the same name. The word was also used in several other\r\nsignifications, which were derived from the original one. Thus the\r\nresidence of a governor of a province was called the _praetorium_;\r\nand the same name was also given to any large house or palace. The\r\ncamp of the praetorian troops at Rome, and frequently the praetorian\r\ntroops themselves, were called by this name. [PRAETORIANI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRANDĬUM. [COENA, p. 96, _b_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRĒLUM.

[LEX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎBŎLĒ (προβολή), an accusation of a criminal nature, preferred\r\nbefore the people of Athens in assembly, with a view to obtain their\r\nsanction for bringing the charge before a judicial tribunal. The\r\n_probolé_ was reserved for those cases where the public had sustained\r\nan injury, or where, from the station, power, or influence of the\r\ndelinquent, the prosecutor might deem it hazardous to proceed in the\r\nordinary way without being authorised by a vote of the sovereign\r\nassembly. In this point it differed from the _eisangelia_, that in\r\nthe latter the people were called upon either to pronounce final\r\njudgment, or to direct some peculiar method of trial; whereas, in the\r\n_probolé_ after the judgment of the assembly, the parties proceeded\r\nto trial in the usual manner. The cases to which the _probolé_ was\r\napplied were, complaints against magistrates for official misconduct\r\nof oppression; against those public informers and mischief-makers who\r\nwere called _sycophantae_ (συκοφάνται); against those who outraged\r\npublic decency at the religious festivals; and against all such as by\r\nevil practices exhibited disaffection to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎBOULEUMA. [BOULE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎBOULI (πρόβουλοι), a name applicable to any persons who are\r\nappointed to consult or take measures for the benefit of the\r\npeople. Ten _probouli_ were appointed at Athens, after the end of\r\nthe Sicilian war, to act as a committee of public safety. Their\r\nauthority did not last much longer than a year; for a year and a half\r\nafterwards Pisander and his colleagues established the council of\r\nFour Hundred, by which the democracy was overthrown.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌCONSUL (ἀνθύπατος), an officer who acted in the place of a\r\nconsul, without holding the office of consul itself. The proconsul,\r\nhowever, was generally one who had held the office of consul, so\r\nthat the proconsulship was a continuation, though a modified one,\r\nof the consulship. The first time when the imperium of a consul\r\nwas prolonged, was in B.C. 327, in the case of Q. Publilius Philo,\r\nwhose return to Rome would have been followed by the loss of most of\r\nthe advantages that had been gained in his campaign. The power of\r\nproconsul was conferred by a senatusconsultum and plebiscitum, and\r\nwas nearly equal to that of a regular consul, for he had the imperium\r\nand jurisdictio, but it differed inasmuch as it did not extend over\r\nthe city and its immediate vicinity, and was conferred, without the\r\nauspicia, by a mere decree of the senate and people, and not in the\r\ncomitia for elections. When the number of Roman provinces had become\r\ngreat, it was customary for the consuls, who during the latter\r\nperiod of the republic spent the year of their consulship at Rome,\r\nto undertake at its close the conduct of a war in a province, or its\r\npeaceful administration, with the title of proconsuls. There are some\r\nextraordinary cases on record in which a man obtained a province with\r\nthe title of proconsul without having held the consulship before. The\r\nfirst case of this kind occurred in B.C. 211, when young P. Cornelius\r\nScipio was created proconsul of Spain in the comitia centuriata.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌCŪRĀTOR, a person who has the management of any business committed\r\nto him by another. Thus it is applied to a person who maintains\r\nor defends an action on behalf of another, or, as we should say,\r\nan attorney [ACTIO]: to a steward in a family [CALCULATOR]: to an\r\nofficer in the provinces belonging to the Caesar, who attended to the\r\nduties discharged by the quaestor in the other provinces [PROVINCIA]:\r\nto an officer engaged in the administration of the fiscus [FISCUS]:\r\nand to various other officers under the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌDĬGĬUM, in its widest acceptation, denotes any sign by which the\r\ngods indicated to men a future event, whether good or evil, and thus\r\nincludes omens and auguries of every description. It is, however,\r\ngenerally employed in a more restricted sense, to signify some\r\nstrange incident or wonderful appearance which was supposed to herald\r\nthe approach of misfortune, and happened under such circumstances as\r\nto announce that the calamity was impending over a whole community\r\nor nation rather than over private individuals. The word may be\r\nconsidered synonymous with _ostentum_, _monstrum_, _portentum_.\r\nSince prodigies were viewed as direct manifestations of the wrath of\r\nheaven, it was believed that this wrath might be appeased by prayers\r\nand sacrifices duly offered to the offended powers. This being a\r\nmatter which deeply concerned the public welfare, the necessary rites\r\nwere in ancient times regularly performed, under the direction of the\r\npontifices, by the consuls before they left the city, the solemnities\r\nbeing called _procuratio prodigiorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODŎSĬA (προδοσία) included not only every species of treason,\r\nbut also every such crime as (in the opinion of the Greeks) would\r\namount to a betraying or desertion of the interest of a man’s\r\ncountry. The highest sort of treason was the attempt to establish a\r\ndespotism (τυραννίς), or to subvert the constitution (καταλύειν τὴν\r\nπολιτείαν), and in democracies καταλύειν τὸν δῆμον or τὸ πλῆθος.\r\nOther kinds of treason were a secret correspondence with a foreign\r\nenemy; a betraying of an important trust, such, as a fleet, army,\r\nor fortress, a desertion of post, a disobedience of orders, or any\r\nother act of treachery, or breach of duty in the public service. But\r\nnot only would _overt acts_ of disobedience or treachery amount to\r\nthe crime of προδοσία, but also the neglect to perform those active\r\nduties which the Greeks in general expected of every good citizen.\r\nCowardice in battle (δειλία) would be an instance of this kind; so\r\nwould any breach of the oath taken by the ἔφηβοι at Athens; or any\r\nline of conduct for which a charge of disaffection to the people\r\n(μισοδημία) might be successfully maintained. The regular punishment\r\nappointed by the law for most kinds of treason appears to have been\r\ndeath, which, no doubt, might be mitigated by decree of the people,\r\nas in the case of Miltiades and many others. The goods of traitors,\r\nwho suffered death, were confiscated, and their houses razed to the\r\nground; nor were they permitted to be buried in the country, but had\r\ntheir bodies cast out in some place on the confines of Attica and\r\nMegara. Therefore it was that the bones of Themistocles, who had been\r\ncondemned for treason, were brought over and buried secretly by his\r\nfriends. The posterity of a traitor became ἄτιμοι, and those of a\r\ntyrant were liable to share the fate of their ancestor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎĔDRI. [BOULE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌFESTI DĬES. [DIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌLĒTĀRĬI. [CAPUT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎMĒTHEIA (προμήθεια), a festival celebrated at Athens in honour\r\nof Prometheus. It was one of the five Attic festivals, which were\r\nheld with a torch-race in the Ceramicus [comp. LAMPADEPHORIA], for\r\nwhich the gymnasiarchs had to supply the youths from the gymnasia.\r\nPrometheus himself was believed to have instituted this torch-race,\r\nwhence he was called the torch-bearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌMULSIS.

[PRAETOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎPỸLAEA (προπύλαια), the entrance to a temple, or sacred enclosure,\r\nconsisted of a gateway flanked by buildings, whence the plural\r\nform of the word. The Egyptian temples generally had magnificent\r\n_propylaea_, consisting of a pair of oblong truncated pyramids of\r\nsolid masonry, the faces of which were sculptured with hieroglyphics.\r\nIn Greek, except when the Egyptian temples are spoken of, the word is\r\ngenerally used to signify the entrance to the Acropolis of Athens,\r\nwhich was executed under the administration of Pericles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌQUAESTOR. [QUAESTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌRA. [NAVIS, p. 263.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌSCĒNĬUM. [THEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌSCRIPTĬO. The verb _proscribere_ properly signifies to exhibit a\r\nthing for sale by means of a bill or advertisement. But in the time\r\nof Sulla it assumed a very different meaning, for he applied it to\r\na measure of his own invention (B.C. 82), namely, the sale of the\r\nproperty of those who were put to death at his command, and who were\r\nthemselves called _proscripti_. After this example of a proscription\r\nhad once been set, it was readily adopted by those in power during\r\nthe civil commotions of subsequent years. In the proscription of\r\nAntonius, Caesar, and Lepidus (B.C. 43), Cicero and some of the most\r\ndistinguished Romans were put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎSTĂTĒS (προστάτης). [LIBERTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎSTĂTĒS TOU DĒMOU (προστάτης τοῦ δήμου), a leader of the people,\r\ndenoted at Athens and in other democratical states, a person who\r\nby his character and eloquence placed himself at the head of the\r\npeople, and whose opinion had the greatest sway amongst them: such\r\nwas Pericles. It appears, however, that προστάτης τοῦ δήμου was also\r\nthe title of a public officer in those Dorian states in which the\r\ngovernment was democratical.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŎTHESMĬA (προθεσμία), the term limited for bringing actions and\r\nprosecutions at Athens. The Athenian expression προθεσμίας νόμος\r\ncorresponds to our _statute of limitations_. The time for commencing\r\nactions to recover debts, or compensation for injuries, appears to\r\nhave been limited to five years at Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌVINCĬA. This word is merely a shortened form of _providentia_, and\r\nwas frequently used in the sense of “a duty” or “matter entrusted\r\nto a person.” But it is ordinarily employed to denote a part of\r\nthe Roman dominion beyond Italy, which had a regular organisation,\r\nand was under Roman administration. Livy likewise uses the word\r\nto denote a district or enemy’s country, which was assigned to a\r\ngeneral as the field of his operations, before the establishment\r\nof any provincial governments.--The Roman state in its complete\r\ndevelopment consisted of two parts with a distinct organisation,\r\n_Italia_ and the _Provinciae_. There were no Provinciae in this\r\nsense of the word till the Romans had extended their conquests\r\nbeyond Italy; and Sicily was the first country that was made a Roman\r\nprovince: Sardinia was made a province B.C. 235. The Roman province\r\nof Gallia Ulterior in the time of Caesar was sometimes designated\r\nsimply by the term Provincia, a name which has been perpetuated in\r\nthe modern Provence. A conquered country received its provincial\r\norganisation either from the Roman commander, whose acts required\r\nthe approval of the senate; or the government was organised by the\r\ncommander and a body of commissioners appointed by the senate out\r\nof their own number. The mode of dealing with a conquered country\r\nwas not uniform. When constituted a provincia, it did not become to\r\nall purposes an integral part of the Roman state; it retained its\r\nnational existence, though it lost its sovereignty. The organisation\r\nof Sicily was completed by P. Rupilius with the aid of ten legates.\r\nThe island was formed into two districts, with Syracuse for the\r\nchief town of the eastern and Lilybaeum of the western district:\r\nthe whole island was administered by a governor annually sent from\r\nRome. He was assisted by two quaestors, and was accompanied by a\r\ntrain of praecones, scribae, haruspices, and other persons, who\r\nformed his cohors. The quaestors received from the Roman aerarium\r\nthe necessary sums for the administration of the island, and they\r\nalso collected the taxes, except those which were farmed by the\r\ncensors at Rome. One quaestor resided at Lilybaeum, and the other\r\nwith the governor or praetor at Syracuse. For the administration of\r\njustice the island was divided into _Fora_ or _Conventus_, which\r\nwere territorial divisions. [CONVENTUS.] The island was bound to\r\nfurnish and maintain soldiers and sailors for the service of Rome,\r\nand to pay tributum for the carrying on of wars. The governor could\r\ntake provisions for the use of himself and his cohors on condition\r\nof paying for them. The Roman state had also the portoria which were\r\nlet to farm to Romans at Rome. The governor had complete jurisdictio\r\nin the island, with the imperium and potestas. He could delegate\r\nthese powers to his quaestors, but there was always an appeal to\r\nhim, and for this and other purposes he made circuits through the\r\ndifferent conventus.--Such was the organisation of Sicilia as a\r\nprovince, which may be taken as a sample of the general character\r\nof Roman provincial government. The governor, upon entering on his\r\nduties, published an edict, which was often framed upon the Edictum\r\nUrbanum. Cicero, when proconsul of Cilicia, says that on some matters\r\nhe framed an edict of his own, and that as to others he referred to\r\nthe Edicta Urbana. There was one great distinction between Italy\r\nand the provinces as to the nature of property in land. Provincial\r\nland could not be an object of Quiritarian ownership, and it was\r\naccordingly appropriately called Possessio. Provincial land could be\r\ntransferred without the forms required in the case of Italian land,\r\nbut it was subject to the payment of a land-tax (_vectigal_).--The\r\nRoman provinces up to the battle of Actium are: Sicilia, Sardinia\r\net Corsica; Hispania Citerior et Ulterior; Gallia Citerior; Gallia\r\nNarbonensis et Comata; Illyricum; Macedonia; Achaia; Asia; Cilicia;\r\nSyria; Bithynia et Pontus; Cyprus; Africa; Cyrenaica et Creta;\r\nNumidia; Mauritania. Those of a subsequent date, which were either\r\nnew or arose from division, are: Rhaetia; Noricum; Pannonia; Moesia;\r\nDacia; Britannia; Mauritania Caesariensis and Tingitana; Aegyptus;\r\nCappadocia; Galatia; Rhodus; Lycia; Commagene; Judaea; Arabia;\r\nMesopotamia; Armenia; Assyria.--At first praetors were appointed\r\nas governors of provinces, but afterwards they were appointed to\r\nthe government of provinces, upon the expiration of their year of\r\noffice at Rome, and with the title of propraetores. In the later\r\ntimes of the republic, the consuls also, after the expiration of\r\ntheir year of office, received the government of a province, with\r\nthe title of proconsules: such provinces were called consulares. The\r\nprovinces were generally distributed by lot, but the distribution\r\nwas sometimes arranged by agreement among the persons entitled to\r\nthem. By a Sempronian Lex the proconsular provinces were annually\r\ndetermined before the election of the consuls, the object of which\r\nwas to prevent all disputes. A senatus consultum of the year 55 B.C.\r\nprovided that no consul or praetor should have a province till after\r\nthe expiration of five years from the time of his consulship or\r\npraetorship. A province was generally held for a year, but the time\r\nwas often prolonged. When a new governor arrived in his province, his\r\npredecessor was required to leave it within thirty days. The governor\r\nof a province had originally to account at Rome (_ad urbem_) for his\r\nadministration, from his own books and those of his quaestors; but\r\nafter the passing of a Lex Julia, B.C. 61, he was bound to deposit\r\ntwo copies of his accounts (_rationes_) in the two chief cities of\r\nhis province, and to forward one (_totidem verbis_) to the aerarium.\r\nIf the governor misconducted himself in the administration of the\r\nprovince, the provincials applied to the Roman senate, and to the\r\npowerful Romans who were their patroni. The offences of repetundae\r\nand peculatus were the usual grounds of complaint by the provincials;\r\nand if a governor had betrayed the interests of the state, he was\r\nalso liable to the penalties attached to majestas. Quaestiones were\r\nestablished for inquiries into these offences; yet it was not always\r\nan easy matter to bring a guilty governor to the punishment that\r\nhe deserved.--With the establishment of the imperial power under\r\nAugustus, a considerable change was made in the administration of\r\nthe provinces. Augustus took the charge of those provinces where a\r\nlarge military force was required; the rest were left to the care of\r\nthe senate and the Roman people. Accordingly we find in the older\r\njurists the division of provinciae into those which were _propriae\r\npopuli Romani_, and those which were _propriae Caesaris_; and this\r\ndivision, with some modifications, continued to the third century.\r\nThe senatorian provinces were distributed among consulares and those\r\nwho had filled the office of praetor, two provinces being given to\r\nthe consulares and the rest to the praetorii: these governors were\r\ncalled _proconsules_, or _praesides_, which latter is the usual\r\nterm employed by the old jurists for a provincial governor. The\r\npraesides had the jurisdictio of the praetor urbanus and the praetor\r\nperegrinus: and their quaestors had the same jurisdiction that the\r\ncurule aediles had at Rome. The imperial provinces were governed\r\nby _legati Caesaris_, with praetorian power, the proconsular power\r\nbeing in the Caesar himself, and the legati being his deputies and\r\nrepresentatives. The legati were selected from those who had been\r\nconsuls or praetors, or from the senators. They held their office and\r\ntheir power at the pleasure of the emperor; and he delegated to them\r\nboth military command and jurisdictio, just as a proconsul in the\r\nrepublican period delegated these powers to his legati. These legati\r\nhad also legati under them. No quaestors were sent to the provinces\r\nof the Caesar. In place of the quaestors, there were _procuratores\r\nCaesaris_, who were either equites or freedmen of the Caesar.\r\nEgypt was governed by an eques with the title of praefectus. The\r\nprocuratores looked after the taxes, paid the troops, and generally\r\nwere intrusted with the interests of the fiscus. Judaea, which was a\r\npart of the province of Syria, was governed by a procurator, who had\r\nthe powers of a legatus. It appears that there were also procuratores\r\nCaesaris in the senatorian provinces, who collected certain dues of\r\nthe fiscus, which were independent of what was due to the aerarium.\r\nThe regular taxes, as in the republican period, were the poll-tax\r\nand land-tax. The taxation was founded on a census of persons and\r\nproperty, which was established by Augustus. The portoria and other\r\ndues were farmed by the publicani, as in the republican period.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌVŎCĀTĬO. [APPELLATIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRŌVŎCĀTŌRES. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROXĔNUS (πρόξενος). [HOSPITIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRỸTĂNEIUM (πρυτανεῖον), the public hall or town-hall in a Greek\r\nstate. The _prytaneia_ of the ancient Greek states and cities were\r\nto the communities living around them, what private houses were to\r\nthe families which occupied them. Just as the house of each family\r\nwas its home, so was the _prytaneium_ of every state or city the\r\ncommon home of its members or inhabitants. This correspondence\r\nbetween the _prytaneium_ or home of the city, and the private home of\r\na man’s family, was at Athens very remarkable. A perpetual fire was\r\nkept burning on the public altar of the city in the prytaneium, just\r\nas in private houses a fire was kept up on the domestic altar in the\r\ninner court of the house. Moreover, the city of Athens exercised in\r\nits prytaneium the duties of hospitality, both to its own citizens\r\nand to strangers. Thus foreign ambassadors were entertained here,\r\nas well as Athenian envoys, on their return home from a successful\r\nor well-conducted mission. Here, too, were entertained from day to\r\nday the successive prytanes or presidents of the senate, together\r\nwith those citizens who, whether from personal or ancestral services\r\nto the state, were honoured with what was called the σίτησις ἐν\r\nπρυτανείῳ, or the privilege of taking their meals there at the public\r\ncost. This was granted sometimes for a limited period, sometimes\r\nfor life, in which latter case the parties enjoying it were called\r\nἀείσιτοι. Moreover, from the ever-burning fire of the prytaneium, or\r\nhome of a mother state, was carried the sacred fire which was to be\r\nkept burning in the prytaneia of her colonies; and if it happened\r\nthat this was ever extinguished, the flame was rekindled from the\r\nprytaneium of the parent city. Lastly, a prytaneium was also a\r\ndistinguishing mark of an independent state. The prytaneium of Athens\r\nlay under the Acropolis on its northern side (near the ἀγορά), and\r\nwas, as its name denotes, originally the place of assembly of the\r\n_prytanes_; in the earliest times it probably stood on the Acropolis.\r\nOfficers called _prytanes_ (πρυτανεῖς) were entrusted with the chief\r\nmagistracy in several states of Greece, as Corcyra, Corinth, Miletus.\r\nAt Athens they were in early times probably a magistracy of the\r\nsecond rank in the state (next to the archon), acting as judges in\r\nvarious cases (perhaps in conjunction with him), and sitting in the\r\nprytaneium. That this was the case is rendered probable by the fact,\r\nthat even in after-times the fees paid into court by plaintiff and\r\ndefendant, before they could proceed to trial, and received by the\r\ndicasts, were called _prytaneia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRỸTĂNES. [PRYTANEIUM; BOULE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPSĒPHISMA. [BOULE; NOMOTHETES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPSĒPHUS (ψῆφος), a ball of stone, used by the Athenian dicasts in\r\ngiving their verdict. [CADISCUS.] Hence ψηφίζεσθαι and its various\r\nderivatives are used so often to signify _voting_, _determining_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSEUDENGRĂPHĒS GRĂPHĒ (ψευδεγγραφῆς γραφή). The name of every state\r\ndebtor at Athens was entered in a register by the praetores, whose\r\nduty it was to collect the debts, and erase the name of the party\r\nwhen he had paid it. If they made a false entry, either wilfully,\r\nor upon the suggestion of another person, the aggrieved party might\r\ninstitute a prosecution against them, or against the person upon\r\nwhose suggestion it was made. Such prosecution was called γραφὴ\r\nψευδεγγραφῆς. It would lie also, where a man was registered as debtor\r\nfor more than was really due from him.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSEUDŎCLĒTEIAS GRĂPHĒ (ψευδοκλητείας γραφή), a prosecution against\r\none, who had appeared as a witness (κλητήρ or κλήτωρ) to prove that a\r\ndefendant had been duly summoned, and thereby enabled the plaintiff\r\nto get a judgment by default. The false witness (κλητήρ) was liable\r\nto be criminally prosecuted, and punished at the discretion of the\r\ncourt. The γραφὴ ψευδοκλητείας came before the Thesmothetae, and the\r\nquestion at the trial simply was, whether the defendant in the former\r\ncause had been summoned or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSĪLI (ψιλοί). [ARMA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCTĒR (ψυκτήρ, _dim._ ψυκτηρίδιον), a wine-cooler, was sometimes\r\nmade of bronze or silver. One of earthenware is preserved in the\r\nMuseum of Antiquities at Copenhagen. It consists of one deep vessel\r\nfor holding ice, which is fixed within another for holding wine. The\r\nwine was poured in at the top. It thus surrounded the vessel of ice\r\nand was cooled by the contact. It was drawn off so as to fill the\r\ndrinking-cups by means of a cock at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŪBES, PŪBERTAS. [IMPUBES; INFANS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLĬCĀNI, farmers of the public revenues of the Roman state\r\n(_vectigalia_). Their name is formed from _publicum_, which signifies\r\nall that belongs to the state, and is sometimes used by Roman writers\r\nas synonymous with _vectigal_. The revenues which Rome derived from\r\nconquered countries, consisting chiefly of tolls, tithes, harbour\r\nduties, the scriptura, or the tax which was paid for the use of the\r\npublic pasture lands, and the duties paid for the use of mines and\r\nsalt-works (_salinae_), were let out, or, as the Romans expressed it,\r\nwere sold by the censors in Rome itself to the highest bidder. This\r\nsale generally took place in the month of Quinctilis, and was made\r\nfor a lustrum. The terms on which the revenues were let, were fixed\r\nby the censors in the so-called _leges censoriae_. The people or the\r\nsenate, however, sometimes modified the terms fixed by the censors,\r\nin order to raise the credit of the publicani; and in some cases\r\neven the tribunes of the people interfered in this branch of the\r\nadministration. The tithes raised in the province of Sicily alone,\r\nwith the exception of those of wine, oil, and garden produce, were\r\nnot sold at Rome, but in the districts of Sicily itself, according\r\nto a practice established by Hiero. The persons who undertook the\r\nfarming of the public revenue of course belonged to the wealthiest\r\nRomans, and during the latter period of the republic they belonged\r\nalmost exclusively to the equestrian order. Their wealth and\r\nconsequent influence may be seen from the fact, that as early as the\r\nsecond Punic war, after the battle of Cannae, when the aerarium was\r\nentirely exhausted, the publicani advanced large sums of money to the\r\nstate, on condition of repayment after the end of the war. The words\r\nequites and publicani are sometimes used as synonymous. The publicani\r\nhad to give security to the state for the sum at which they bought\r\none or more branches of the revenue in a province; but as for this\r\nreason the property of even the wealthiest individual must have been\r\ninadequate, a number of equites generally united together, and formed\r\na company (_socii_, _societas_, or _corpus_), which was recognised\r\nby the state, and by which they were enabled to carry on their\r\nundertakings upon a large scale. Such companies appear as early as\r\nthe second Punic war. The shares which each partner of such a company\r\ntook in the business were called _partes_, and if they were small,\r\n_particulae_. The responsible person in each company, and the one who\r\ncontracted with the state, was called _manceps_ [MANCEPS]; but there\r\nwas also a _magister_ to manage the business of each society, who\r\nresided at Rome, and kept an extensive correspondence with the agents\r\nin the provinces. He seems to have held his office only for one\r\nyear; his representative in the provinces was called _sub magistro_,\r\nwho had to travel about, and superintend the actual business of\r\ncollecting the revenues. Nobody but a Roman citizen was allowed to\r\nbecome a member of a company of publicani; freedmen and slaves were\r\nexcluded. No Roman magistrate, however, or governor of a province,\r\nwas allowed to take any share whatever in a company of publicani,\r\na regulation which was chiefly intended as a protection against\r\nthe oppression of the provincials. The collection of the taxes in\r\nthe provinces was performed by an inferior class of men, who were\r\nsaid _operas publicanis dare_, or _esse in operis societatis_. They\r\nwere engaged by the publicani, and consisted of freemen as well as\r\nslaves, Romans as well as provincials. The separate branches of the\r\npublic revenue in the provinces (_decumae_, _portoria_, _scriptura_,\r\nand the revenues from the mines and salt-works) were mostly leased\r\nto separate companies of publicani; whence they were distinguished\r\nby names derived from that particular branch which they had taken in\r\nfarm; _e.g._ _decumani_, _pecuarii_ or _scripturarii_, _salinarii_ or\r\n_mancipes salinarum_, &c. [DECUMAE; PORTORIUM; SALINAS; SCRIPTURA.]\r\nThe _portitores_ were not publicani properly so called, but only\r\ntheir servants engaged in examining the goods imported or exported,\r\nand levying the custom-duties upon them. They belonged to the same\r\nclass as the publicans of the New Testament.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLĬCUM. [PUBLICANI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPŬGĬLĀTUS (πύξ, πυγμή, πυγμαχία, πυγμοσύνη), boxing, was one of the\r\nearliest athletic games among the Greeks, and is frequently mentioned\r\nin Homer. In the earliest times boxers (_pugiles_, πύκται) fought\r\nnaked, with the exception of a girdle (ζῶμα) round their loins; but\r\nthis was not used when boxing was introduced at Olympia, as the\r\ncontests in wrestling and racing had been carried on there by persons\r\nentirely naked ever since Ol. 15. Respecting the leathern thongs\r\nwith which pugilists surrounded their fists, see Cestus, where its\r\nvarious forms are illustrated by woodcuts. The Ionians, especially\r\nthose of Samos, were at all times more distinguished pugilists than\r\nthe Dorians, and at Sparta boxing is said to have been forbidden by\r\nthe laws of Lycurgus. But the ancients generally considered boxing as\r\na useful training for military purposes, and a part of education no\r\nless important than any other gymnastic exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŬGILLĀRES. [TABULAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPŬGĬO (μάχαιρα), a dagger; a two-edged knife, commonly of bronze,\r\nwith the hand in many cases variously ornamented or enriched.\r\n\r\n\r\nPULLĀRĬUS. [AUSPICIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPULPĬTUM. [THEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPULVĪNAR, a couch provided with cushions or pillows (_pulvini_),\r\non which the Romans placed the statues of the gods at the\r\n_Lectisternia_. [EPULONES; LECTISTERNIUM.] There was also a\r\n_pulvinar_, on which the images of the gods were laid, in the Circus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPŪPILLA, PŪPILLUS, the name given to every _impubes_ not in the power\r\nof their father, but subject to a guardian. [IMPUBES; TUTELA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPUPPIS. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPŬTĔAL, properly means the enclosure surrounding the opening of a\r\nwell, to protect persons from falling into it. It was either round\r\nor square, and seems usually to have been of the height of three\r\nor four feet from the ground. It was the practice in some cases to\r\nsurround a sacred place with an enclosure open at the top, and such\r\nenclosures, from the great similarity they bore to _putealia_, were\r\ncalled by this name. There were two such places in the Roman forum;\r\none of these was called _Puteal Libonis_ or _Scribonianum_, because\r\na chapel (_sacellum_) in that place had been struck by lightning,\r\nand Scribonius Libo expiated it by proper ceremonies, and erected\r\na puteal around it, open at the top, to preserve the memory of the\r\nplace. The form of this puteal is preserved on several coins of the\r\nScribonian gens. This puteal seems to have been near the atrium of\r\nVesta, and was a common place of meeting for usurers. The other\r\nputeal was in the comitium, on the left side of the senate-house, and\r\nin it were deposited the whetstone and razor of ATTUS NAVIUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Puteal on a Coin of the Scribonia Gens. (British\r\nMuseum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTĬCŬLI. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPỸANEPSIA (πυανέψια), a festival celebrated at Athens every year on\r\nthe seventh of Pyanepsion, in honour of Apollo, said to have been\r\ninstituted by Theseus after his return from Crete. The festival, as\r\nwell as the month in which it took place, are said to have derived\r\ntheir names from πύαμος, another form for κύαμος, _i.e._ pulse or\r\nbeans, which were cooked at this season and carried about.\r\n\r\n\r\nPỸLĂGŎRAE. [AMPHICTYONES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPỸRA. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPYRRHĬCA. [SALTATIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPȲTHĬA (πύθια), one of the four great national festivals of the\r\nGreeks. It was celebrated in the neighbourhood of Delphi, anciently\r\ncalled Pytho, in honour of Apollo, Artemis, and Leto. The place of\r\nthis solemnity was the Crissaean plain, which for this purpose\r\ncontained a hippodromus or race-course, a stadium of 1000 feet in\r\nlength, and a theatre, in which the musical contests took place.\r\nThe Pythian games were, according to most legends, instituted by\r\nApollo himself. They were originally perhaps nothing more than a\r\nreligious panegyris, occasioned by the oracle of Delphi, and the\r\nsacred games are said to have been at first only a musical contest,\r\nwhich consisted in singing a hymn to the honour of the Pythian god,\r\nwith the accompaniment of the cithara. They must, on account of the\r\ncelebrity of the Delphic oracle, have become a national festival\r\nfor all the Greeks at a very early period, and gradually all the\r\nvarious contests were introduced which occur in the Olympic games.\r\n[OLYMPIA.] Down to Ol. 48. the Delphians had been the agonothetae at\r\nthe Pythian games; but in the third year of this Olympiad, after the\r\nCrissaean war, the Amphictyons took the management under their care,\r\nand appointed certain persons, called _Epimeletae_ (ἐπιμεληταί),\r\nto conduct them. Some of the ancients date the institution of the\r\nPythian games from this time. Previous to Ol. 48. the Pythian games\r\nhad been an ἐνναετηρίς, that is, they had been celebrated at the\r\nend of every eighth year; but in Ol. 48. 3. they became, like the\r\nOlympia, a πενταετηρίς, _i.e._ they were held at the end of every\r\nfourth year; and a Pythiad, therefore, from the time that it was\r\nused as an aera, comprehended a space of four years, commencing\r\nwith the third year of every Olympiad. They were in all probability\r\nheld in the spring, and took place in the month of Bucatius, which\r\ncorresponded to the Attic Munychion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPȲTHĬI (πύθιοι), four persons appointed by the Spartan kings, two by\r\neach, as messengers to the temple of Delphi. Their office was highly\r\nhonourable and important; they were always the messmates of the\r\nSpartan kings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPYXIS, _dim._ PYXĬDŬLA (πύξις, dim. πυξίδιον), a casket; a\r\njewel-box. The caskets in which the ladies of ancient times kept\r\ntheir jewels and other ornaments, were made of gold, silver, ivory,\r\nmother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell, &c. They were also much enriched\r\nwith sculpture. The annexed woodcut represents a very plain\r\njewel-box, out of which a dove is extracting a riband or fillet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pyxis, jewel-box. (From a Painting at Herculaneum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUADRĀGĒSĬMA, the fortieth part of the imported goods, was the\r\nordinary rate of the Portorium under the empire. [PORTORIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUADRANS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUADRANTAL, or AMPHŎRA QUADRANTAL, or AMPHŎRA only, was the principal\r\nRoman measure of capacity for fluids. A standard model of the\r\n_Amphora_ was kept with great care in the temple of Jupiter in the\r\nCapitol, and was called _amphora Capitolina_. It contained 5·77\r\nimperial gallons, or a little more than 5¾ gallons, or than 5 gallons\r\nand 6 pints.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUADRĪGA. [CURRUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUADRĪGĀTUS. [DENARIUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUADRŬPLĀTŌRES: public informers or accusers were so called, either\r\nbecause they received a fourth part of the criminal’s property, or\r\nbecause those who were convicted were condemned to pay fourfold\r\n(_quadrupli damnari_), as in cases of violation of the laws\r\nrespecting gambling, usury, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUAESTIŌNES, QUAESTIŌNES PERPĔTUAE. [JUDEX: PRAETOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUAESTOR (ταμίας), a name given to two distinct classes of Roman\r\nofficers. It is derived from _quaero_, and Varro gives a definition\r\nwhich embraces the principal functions of both classes of officers:\r\n_Quaestores a quaerendo, qui conquirerent publicas pecunias et\r\nmaleficia_. The one class, therefore, had to do with the collecting\r\nand keeping of the public revenues, and the others were a kind of\r\npublic accusers. The former bore the name of _Quaestores Classici_,\r\nthe latter of _Quaestores Parricidii_.--The _Quaestores Parricidii_\r\nwere public accusers, two in number, who conducted the accusation of\r\npersons guilty of murder or any other capital offence, and carried\r\nthe sentence into execution. In the early period of the republic\r\nthe quaestores parricidii appear to have become a standing office,\r\nwhich, like others, was held only for one year. They were appointed\r\nby the populus or the curies on the presentation of the consuls.\r\nWhen these quaestores discovered that a capital offence had been\r\ncommitted, they had to bring the charge before the comitia for trial.\r\nWhen the sentence had been pronounced by the people, the quaestores\r\nparricidii executed it; thus they threw Spurius Cassius from the\r\nTarpeian rock. They were mentioned in the laws of the Twelve Tables,\r\nand after the time of the decemvirate they still continued to be\r\nappointed, though probably no longer by the curies, but either in\r\nthe comitia centuriata or tribute, which they therefore must have had\r\nthe right of assembling in cases of emergency. From the year B.C. 366\r\nthey are no longer mentioned in Roman history, as their functions\r\nwere gradually transferred to the triumviri capitales. [TRIUMVIRI\r\nCAPITALES.]--The _Quaestores Classici_, usually called _Quaestores_\r\nsimply, were officers entrusted with the care of the public money.\r\nThey were elected by the centuries, and the office is said to have\r\nbeen first instituted by Valerius Publicola. They were at first\r\nonly two in number, and of course taken only from the patricians.\r\nAs the senate had the supreme administration of the finances, the\r\nquaestors were in some measure only its agents or paymasters, for\r\nthey could not dispose of any part of the public money without being\r\ndirected by the senate. Their duties consequently consisted in making\r\nthe necessary payments from the aerarium, and receiving the public\r\nrevenues. Of both they had to keep correct accounts in their _tabulae\r\npublicae_. Demands which any one might have on the aerarium, and\r\noutstanding debts, were likewise registered by them. Fines to be paid\r\nto the public treasury were registered and exacted by them. Another\r\nbranch of their duties, which, however, was likewise connected with\r\nthe treasury, was to provide the proper accommodation for foreign\r\nambassadors, and such persons as were connected with the republic\r\nby ties of public hospitality.--In B.C. 421 the number of quaestors\r\nwas doubled, and the tribunes tried to effect, by an amendment of\r\nthe law, that a part (probably two) of the quaestores should be\r\nplebeians. This attempt was indeed frustrated, but the interrex L.\r\nPapirius effected a compromise, that the election should not be\r\nrestricted to either order. After this law was carried, eleven years\r\npassed without any plebeian being elected to the office: at last, in\r\nB.C. 409, three of the four quaestors were plebeians. A person who\r\nhad held the office of quaestor had undoubtedly, as in later times,\r\nthe right to take his seat in the senate, unless he was excluded as\r\nunworthy by the next censors. And this was probably the reason why\r\nthe patricians so resolutely opposed the admission of plebeians to\r\nthis office. Henceforth the consuls, whenever they took the field\r\nagainst an enemy, were accompanied by one quaestor each, who at\r\nfirst had only to superintend the sale of the booty, the produce of\r\nwhich was either divided among the legion, or was transferred to\r\nthe aerarium. Subsequently, however, we find that these quaestors\r\nalso kept the funds of the army, which they had received from the\r\ntreasury at Rome, and gave the soldiers their pay; they were in fact\r\nthe paymasters of the army. The two other quaestors, who remained\r\nat Rome, continued to discharge the same duties as before, and\r\nwere distinguished from those who accompanied the consuls by the\r\nepithet _urbani_. In B.C. 265, after the Romans had made themselves\r\nmasters of Italy, and when, in consequence, the administration of\r\nthe treasury and the raising of the revenues became more laborious\r\nand important, the number of quaestors was again doubled to eight;\r\nand it is probable that henceforth their number continued to be\r\nincreased in proportion as the empire became extended. One of the\r\neight quaestors was appointed by lot to the _Quaestura Ostiensis_,\r\na most laborious and important post, as he had to provide Rome with\r\ncorn. Besides the quaestor Ostiensis, who resided at Ostia, three\r\nother quaestors were distributed in Italy, to raise those parts of\r\nthe revenue which were not farmed by the publicani, and to control\r\nthe latter. One of them resided at Cales, and the two others probably\r\nin towns on the Upper Sea. The two remaining quaestors were sent to\r\nSicily.--Sulla, in his dictatorship, raised the number of quaestors\r\nto twenty, that he might have a large number of candidates for the\r\nsenate, and J. Caesar even to forty. In the year B.C. 49 no quaestors\r\nwere elected, and Caesar transferred the keeping of the aerarium\r\nto the aediles. From this time forward the treasury was sometimes\r\nentrusted to the praetors, sometimes to the praetorii, and sometimes\r\nagain to quaestors. [AERARIUM.] Quaestors, however, both in the city\r\nand in the provinces, occur down to the latest period of the empire.\r\nThe proconsul or praetor, who had the administration of a province,\r\nwas attended by a quaestor. This quaestor had undoubtedly to perform\r\nthe same functions as those who accompanied the armies into the\r\nfield; they were in fact the same officers, with the exception that\r\nthe former were stationary in their province during the time of\r\ntheir office, and had consequently rights and duties which those who\r\naccompanied the armies could not have. In the provinces the quaestors\r\nhad the same jurisdiction as the curule aediles at Rome. The relation\r\nexisting between a praetor or proconsul of a province and his\r\nquaestor was, according to ancient custom, regarded as resembling\r\nthat between a father and his son. When a quaestor died in his\r\nprovince, the praetors had the right of appointing a _proquaestor_ in\r\nhis stead; and when the praetor was absent, the quaestor supplied his\r\nplace, and was then attended by lictors. In what manner the provinces\r\nwere assigned to the quaestors after their election at Rome, is\r\nnot mentioned, though it was probably by lot, as in the case of the\r\nquaestor Ostiensis.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUAESTŌRĬUM.

Ovid says that it was celebrated\r\nfor five days, that on the first day no blood was shed, but that on\r\nthe last four there were contests of gladiators. It would appear,\r\nhowever, that only the first day was the festival properly so called,\r\nand that the last four were merely an addition made perhaps in the\r\ntime of Caesar, to gratify the people, who became so passionately\r\nfond of gladiatorial combats. On the fifth day of the festival,\r\naccording to Ovid, the trumpets used in sacred rites were purified;\r\nbut this seems to have been originally a separate festival called\r\n_Tubilustrium_, which was celebrated, as we know from the ancient\r\ncalendars, on the 23rd of March, and would of course, when the\r\nQuinquatrus was extended to five days, fall on the last day of that\r\nfestival. There was also another festival of this name, called\r\n_Quinquatrus Minusculae_ or _Quinquatrus Minores_, celebrated on\r\nthe Ides of June, on which the tibicines went through the city in\r\nprocession to the temple of Minerva.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINQUENNĀLĬA, were games instituted by Nero, A.D. 60, in imitation\r\nof the Greek festivals, and celebrated like the Greek πενταετηρίδες,\r\nat the end of every four years: they consisted of musical, gymnastic,\r\nand equestrian contests.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINQUENNĀLIS.

The day is marked in the Fasti as\r\nnefastus. In some ancient calendars the 24th of May is likewise\r\ncalled Regifugium. It is doubtful whether either of these days had\r\nanything to do with the flight of king Tarquinius: they may have\r\nderived their name from the symbolical flight of the Rex Sacrorum\r\nfrom the comitium; for this king-priest was generally not allowed to\r\nappear in the comitium, which was destined for the transaction of\r\npolitical matters in which he could not take part. But on certain\r\ndays in the year, and certainly on the two days mentioned above,\r\nhe had to go to the comitium for the purpose of offering certain\r\nsacrifices, and immediately after he had performed his functions\r\nthere, he hastily fled from it; and this symbolical flight was called\r\nRegifugium.\r\n\r\n\r\nRĔLĒGĀTĬO. [EXSILIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRĔMANCĬPĀTIO. [EMANCIPATIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRĔMULCUM (ῥυμουλκηῖν τὰς ναῦς), a rope for towing a ship, and\r\nlikewise a tow-barge.\r\n\r\n\r\nRĔMŪRĬA. [LEMURIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRĒMUS. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRĔPĔTUNDAE, or PĔCŪNĬAE RĔPĔTUNDAE, was the term used to designate\r\nsuch sums of money as the socii of the Roman state or individuals\r\nclaimed to recover from magistratus, judices, or publici curatores,\r\nwhich they had improperly taken or received in the Provinciae, or\r\nin the Urbs Roma, either in the discharge of their jurisdictio,\r\nor in their capacity of judices, or in respect of any other public\r\nfunction. Sometimes the word Repetundae was used to express the\r\nillegal act for which compensation was sought, as in the phrase\r\n_repetundarum insimulari, damnari_; and Pecuniae meant not only\r\nmoney, but anything that had value. The first lex on the subject\r\nwas the Calpurnia, which was proposed and carried by the tribunus\r\nplebis L. Calpurnius Piso (B.C. 149). By this lex a praetor was\r\nappointed for trying persons charged with this crime. It seems that\r\nthe penalties of the Lex Calpurnia were merely pecuniary, and at\r\nleast did not comprise exsilium. Various leges de repetundis were\r\npassed after the Lex Calpurnia, and the penalties were continually\r\nmade heavier. The Lex Junia was passed probably about B.C. 126, on\r\nthe proposal of M. Junius Pennus, tribunus plebis. The Lex Servilia\r\nGlaucia was proposed and carried by C. Servilius Glaucia, praetor,\r\nin the sixth consulship of Marius, B.C. 100. This lex applied to\r\nany magistratus who had improperly taken or received money from\r\nany private person; but a magistratus could not be accused during\r\nthe term of office. The lex enacted that the praetor peregrinus\r\nshould annually appoint 450 judices for the trial of this offence:\r\nthe judices were not to be senators. The penalties of the lex were\r\npecuniary and exsilium; the law allowed a comperendinatio. [JUDEX.]\r\nBefore the Lex Servilia, the pecuniary penalty was simply restitution\r\nof what had been wrongfully taken; this lex seems to have raised\r\nthe penalty to double the amount of what had been wrongfully taken;\r\nand subsequently it was made quadruple. Exsilium was only the\r\npunishment in case a man did not abide his trial, but withdrew from\r\nRome. The lex gave the civitas to any person on whose complaint a\r\nperson was convicted of repetundae. The Lex Acilia, which seems\r\nto be of uncertain date, was proposed and carried by M’. Acilius\r\nGlabrio, a tribune of the plebs, and enacted that there should be\r\nneither ampliatio nor comperendinatio. The Lex Cornelia was passed\r\nin the dictatorship of Sulla, and continued in force to the time of\r\nC. Julius Caesar. It extended the penalties of repetundae to other\r\nillegal acts committed in the provinces, and to judices who received\r\nbribes, to those to whose hands the money came, and to those who did\r\nnot give into the aerarium their proconsular accounts (_proconsulares\r\nrationes_). The praetor who presided over this quaestio chose the\r\njudges by lot from the senators, whence it appears that the Servilia\r\nLex was repealed by this lex, at least so far as related to the\r\nconstitution of the court. This lex also allowed ampliatio and\r\ncomperendinatio. The penalties were pecuniary (_litis aestimatio_)\r\nand the _aquae et ignis interdictio_. Under this lex were tried\r\nL. Dolabella, Cn. Piso, C. Verres, C. Macer, M. Fonteius, and L.\r\nFlaccus, the two last of whom were defended by Cicero. In the Verrine\r\nOrations Cicero complains of the comperendinatio or double hearing\r\nof the cause, which the Lex Cornelia allowed, and refers to the\r\npractice under the Lex Acilia, according to which the case for the\r\nprosecution, the defence, and the evidence were only heard once, and\r\nso the matter was decided. The last lex de repetundis was the Lex\r\nJulia, passed in the first consulship of C. Julius Caesar, B.C. 59.\r\nThis lex repealed the penalty of exsilium, but in addition to the\r\nlitis aestimatio, it enacted that persons convicted under this lex\r\nshould lose their rank, and be disqualified from being witnesses,\r\njudices, or senators. The lex had been passed when Cicero made his\r\noration against Piso, B.C. 55. A. Gabinius was convicted under this\r\nlex. Under the empire the offence was punishable with exile.\r\n\r\n\r\nRĔPŌTĬA.

Nets were made\r\nmost commonly of flax or hemp, whence they are sometimes called\r\n_lina_ (λίνα). The meshes (_maculae_, βρόχοι, _dim._ βροχίδες) were\r\ngreat or small according to the purposes intended. By far the most\r\nimportant application of net-work was to the three kindred arts\r\nof fowling, hunting, and fishing. In fowling the use of nets was\r\ncomparatively limited. In hunting it was usual to extend nets in\r\na curved line of considerable length, so as in part to surround a\r\nspace into which the beasts of chace, such as the hare, the boar,\r\nthe deer, the lion, and the bear, were driven through the opening\r\nleft on one side. This range of nets was flanked by cords, to which\r\nfeathers dyed scarlet and of other bright colours were tied, so as to\r\nflare and flutter in the wind. The hunters then sallied forth with\r\ntheir dogs, dislodged the animals from their coverts, and by shouts\r\nand barking drove them first within the _formido_, as the apparatus\r\nof string and feathers was called, and then, as they were scared\r\nwith this appearance, within the circuit of the nets. In the drawing\r\nbelow three servants with staves carry on their shoulders a large\r\nnet, which is intended to be set up as already described. In the\r\nlower figure the net is set up. At each end of it stands a watchman\r\nholding a staff. Being intended to take such large quadrupeds as\r\nboars and deer (which are seen within it), the meshes are very wide\r\n(_retia rara_). The net is supported by three stakes (στάλικες,\r\n_ancones_, _vari_). To dispose the nets in this manner was called\r\n_retia ponere_, or _retia tendere_. Comparing it with the stature of\r\nthe attendants, we perceive the net to be between five and six feet\r\nhigh. The upper border of the net consists of a strong rope, which\r\nwas called σαρδών. Fishing-nets (ἁλιευτικὰ δίκτυα) were of different\r\nkinds. Of these the most common were the ἀμφίβληστρον, or casting-net\r\n(_funda_, _jaculum_, _retinaculum_) and the σαγήνη, _i.e._ the\r\ndrag-net, or sean (_tragum_, _tragula_, _verriculum_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Retia, Nets. (From the same.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nRĔUS. [ACTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREX (βασιλεύς, ἄναξ), king.--(1) GREEK. In the heroic age, as\r\ndepicted in the poems of Homer, the kingly form of government was\r\nuniversal. The authority of these kings and its limitations were\r\nderived not from any definite scheme, or written code, but from\r\nthe force of traditionary usage, and the natural influence of the\r\ncircumstances in which the kings were placed, surrounded as they were\r\nby a body of chiefs or nobles, whose power was but little inferior\r\nto that of the kings themselves. Even the title βασιλῆες is applied\r\nto them as well as to the king. The maintenance of regal authority\r\ndoubtless depended greatly on the possession of personal superiority\r\nin bravery, military prowess, wisdom in council and eloquence in\r\ndebate. When old age had blunted his powers and activity, a king\r\nran a great chance of losing his influence. There was, however, an\r\nundefined notion of a sort of divine right connected with the kingly\r\noffice, whence the epithet διοτρεφής, so commonly applied to kings\r\nin Homer. The characteristic emblem of the kingly office was the\r\nσκῆπτρον. [SCEPTRUM.] Our information respecting the Grecian kings\r\nin the more historical age is not ample or minute enough to enable\r\nus to draw out a detailed scheme of their functions. Respecting the\r\nkings of Sparta the reader is referred to the article EPHORI. As\r\nan illustration of the gradual limitation of the prerogatives of\r\nthe king or chief magistrate, the reader may consult the article\r\nARCHON. The title _Basileus_ was sometimes applied to an officer\r\nwho discharged the priestly functions of the more ancient kings,\r\nas in Athens. [ARCHON.]--(2) ROMAN. Rome was originally governed\r\nby kings. All the ancient writers agree in representing the king\r\nas elected by the people for life, and as voluntarily entrusted by\r\nthem with the supreme power in the state. No reference is made to\r\nthe hereditary principle in the election of the first four kings;\r\nand it is not until the fifth king Tarquinius Priscus obtained the\r\nsovereignty, that anything is said about the children of the deceased\r\nking. Since the people had conferred the regal power, it returned\r\nto them upon the death of the king. But as a new king could not\r\nbe immediately appointed, an Interrex forthwith stepped into his\r\nplace. The necessity for an immediate successor to the king arose\r\nfrom the circumstance that he alone had had the power of taking the\r\nauspicia on behalf of the state; and as the auspicia devolved upon\r\nthe people at his death, it was imperative upon them to create a\r\nmagistrate, to whom they could delegate the auspicia, and who would\r\nthus possess the power of mediating between the gods and the state.\r\nOriginally the people consisted only of the patres or patricii;\r\nand accordingly on the death of the king, we read _res ad patres\r\nredit_, or, what is nearly the same thing, _auspicia ad patres\r\nredeunt_. [AUGUR.] The interrex was elected by the whole body of\r\nthe patricians, and he appointed (_prodebat_) his successor, as it\r\nwas a rule that the first interrex could not hold the comitia for\r\nthe election; but it frequently happened that the second interrex\r\nappointed a third, the third a fourth, and so on, till the election\r\ntook place. The Interrex presided over the comitia curiata, which\r\nwere assembled for the election of the king. The person whom the\r\nsenate had selected was proposed by the interrex to the people in\r\na regular _rogatio_, which the people could only accept or reject,\r\nfor they had not the initiative and could not themselves propose\r\nany name. If the people voted in favour of the rogation, they were\r\nsaid _creare regem_, and their acceptance of him was called _jussus\r\npopuli_. But the king did not immediately enter upon his office. Two\r\nother acts had still to take place before he was invested with the\r\nfull regal authority and power. First, his _inauguratio_ had to be\r\nperformed, as it was necessary to obtain the divine will respecting\r\nhis appointment by means of the auspices, since he was the high\r\npriest of the people. This ceremony was performed by an augur, who\r\nconducted the newly-elected king to the _arx_, or citadel, and there\r\nplaced him on a stone seat with his face turned to the south, while\r\nthe people waited below in anxious suspense until the augur announced\r\nthat the gods had sent the favourable tokens confirming the king\r\nin his priestly character. The inauguratio did not confer upon him\r\nthe auspicia; for these he obtained by his election to the royalty,\r\nas the comitia were held _auspicato_. The second act which had to\r\nbe performed was the conferring of the imperium upon the king. The\r\ncuriae had only determined by their previous vote who was to be\r\nking, and had not by that act bestowed the necessary power upon him;\r\nthey had, therefore, to grant him the imperium by a distinct vote.\r\nAccordingly the king himself proposed to the curiae a _lex curiata\r\nde imperio_, and the curiae by voting in favour of it gave him the\r\nimperium. Livy in his first book makes no mention of the _lex curiata\r\nde imperio_, but he uses the expressions _patres auctores fierent_,\r\n_patres auctores facti_; but these expressions are equivalent to the\r\n_lex curiata de imperio_ in the kingly period.--The king possessed\r\nthe supreme power in the earliest times, and the senate and the\r\ncomitia of the curiae were very slight checks upon its exercise. In\r\nthe first place, the king alone possessed the right of taking the\r\nauspices on behalf of the state; and as no public business of any\r\nkind could be performed without the approbation of the gods expressed\r\nby the auspices, the king stood as mediator between the gods and\r\nthe people, and in an early stage of society must necessarily have\r\nbeen regarded with religious awe. [AUGUR.] Secondly, the people\r\nsurrendered to the king the supreme military and judicial authority\r\nby conferring the _imperium_ upon him. The king was not only the\r\ncommander in war, but the supreme judge in peace. Seated on his\r\nthrone in the comitium, he administered justice to all comers,\r\nand decided in all cases which were brought before him, civil as\r\nwell as criminal. Again, all the magistrates in the kingly period\r\nappear to have been appointed by the king and not elected by the\r\ncuriae. Further, the king was not dependent upon the people for his\r\nsupport; but a large portion of the ager publicus belonged to him,\r\nwhich was cultivated at the expense of the state on his behalf. He\r\nhad also the absolute disposal of the booty taken in war and of\r\nthe conquered lands. It must not, however, be supposed that the\r\nauthority of the king was absolute. The senate and the assembly of\r\nthe people must have formed some check upon his power. But these were\r\nnot independent bodies possessing the right of meeting at certain\r\ntimes and discussing questions of state. They could only be called\r\ntogether when the king chose, and further could only determine upon\r\nmatters which the king submitted to them. The only public matter in\r\nwhich the king could not dispense with the co-operation of the senate\r\nand the curiae was in declarations of war. There is no trace of the\r\npeople having had anything to do with the conclusion of treaties\r\nof peace.--The insignia of the king were the fasces with the axes\r\n(_secures_), which twelve lictors carried before him as often as he\r\nappeared in public, the _trabea_, the _sella curulis_, and the _toga\r\npraetexta_ and _picta_. The _trabea_ appears to have been the most\r\nancient official dress, and is assigned especially to Romulus: it\r\nwas of Latin origin, and is therefore represented by Virgil as worn\r\nby the Latin kings. The _toga praetexta_ and _picta_ were borrowed,\r\ntogether with the _sella curulis_, from the Etruscans, and their\r\nintroduction is variously ascribed to Tullus Hostilius or Tarquinius\r\nPriscus.\r\n\r\n\r\nREX SACRĬFĬCŬLUS, REX SACRĬFĬCUS, or REX SACRORUM. When the civil\r\nand military powers of the king were transferred to two praetors\r\nor consuls, upon the establishment of the republican government at\r\nRome, these magistrates were not invested with that part of the royal\r\ndignity by virtue of which the king had been the high priest of his\r\nnation and had conducted several of the sacra publica, but this\r\npriestly part of his office was transferred to a priest called Rex\r\nSacrificulus or Rex Sacrorum. The first rex sacrorum was designated,\r\nat the command of the consuls, by the college of pontiffs, and\r\ninaugurated by the augurs. He was always elected and inaugurated\r\nin the comitia curiata under the presidency of the pontiffs,\r\nand as long as a rex sacrificulus was appointed at Rome, he was\r\nalways a patrician, for as he had no influence upon the management\r\nof political affairs, the plebeians never coveted this dignity.\r\nConsidering that this priest was the religious representative of\r\nthe kings, he ranked indeed higher than all other priests, and even\r\nhigher than the pontifex maximus, but in power and influence he was\r\nfar inferior to him. He held his office for life, was not allowed to\r\nhold any civil or military dignity, and was at the same time exempted\r\nfrom all military and civil duties. His principal functions were: 1.\r\nTo perform those sacra publica which had before been performed by the\r\nkings; and his wife, who bore the title of _regina sacrorum_, had\r\nalso, like the queens of former days, to perform certain priestly\r\nfunctions. These sacra publica he or his wife had to perform on\r\nall the Calends, Ides, and the Nundines; he to Jupiter, and she to\r\nJuno in the regia. 2. On the days called regifugium he had to offer\r\na sacrifice in the comitium. [REGIFUGIUM.] 3. When extraordinary\r\nportenta seemed to announce some general calamity, it was his duty to\r\ntry to propitiate the anger of the gods. 4. On the nundines, when the\r\npeople assembled in the city, the rex sacrorum announced (_edicebat_)\r\nto them the succession of the festivals for the month. This part\r\nof his functions, however, must have ceased after the time of Cn.\r\nFlavius. He lived in a domus publica on the via sacra, near the regia\r\nand the house of the vestal virgins.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHĒDA or RĒDA, a travelling carriage with four wheels. Like the\r\nCOVINUS and the ESSEDUM it was of Gallic origin, and may perhaps\r\ncontain the same root as the German _reiten_ and our _ride_. It\r\nwas the common carriage used by the Romans for travelling, and was\r\nfrequently made large enough not only to contain many persons, but\r\nalso baggage and utensils of various kinds. The word _Epirhedium_,\r\nwhich was formed by the Romans from the Greek preposition ἐπι and\r\nthe Gallic _rheda_, is explained by the Scholiast on Juvenal as\r\n“Ornamentum rhedarum aut plaustrum.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRHĒTRAE (ῥῆτραι), specially the name of the ordinances of Lycurgus.\r\nThe word _Rhetra_ means a solemn compact, either originally emanating\r\nfrom, or subsequently sanctioned by the gods, who are always parties\r\nto such agreements. The Rhetra of Lycurgus emanated from the Delphian\r\ngod: but the kings, senators, and people all bound themselves, both\r\nto each other and to the gods, to obey it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHYTON (ῥυτόν), a drinking-horn (κέρας). Its original form was\r\nprobably the horn of the ox, but one end of it was afterwards\r\nornamented with the heads of various animals and birds. The _rhyton_\r\nhad a small opening at the bottom, which the person who drank put\r\ninto his mouth, and allowed the wine to run in: hence it derived its\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rhyton, drinking-horn. (Museo Borbonico.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nRĪCA. [FLAMEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRĪCĪNĬUM, an article of female dress, appears to have been a kind of\r\nmantle, with a sort of cowl attached to it, in order to cover the\r\nhead. The _mavortium_, _mavorte_, or _mavors_ of later times was\r\nthought to be only another name for what had formerly been called\r\nricinium.\r\n\r\n\r\nRŌBĪGĀLĬA, a public festival in honour of the god Robigus, to\r\npreserve the fields from mildew, is said to have been instituted by\r\nNuma, and was celebrated April 25th. The sacrifices offered on this\r\noccasion consisted of the entrails of a dog and a sheep, accompanied\r\nwith frankincense and wine: a prayer was presented by a flamen in the\r\ngrove of the ancient deity, whom Ovid and Columella make a goddess. A\r\ngod Robigus or a goddess Robigo is a mere invention from the name of\r\nthis festival, for the Romans paid no divine honours to evil deities.\r\n\r\n\r\nRŎGĀTĬO. [LEX, p. 225.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRŎGĀTŌRES. [COMITIA, p. 107.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRŎGUS. [FUNUS, p. 188, _b_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nROMPHEA. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRŌRĀRĬI. [EXERCITUS, p. 165.]\r\n\r\n\r\nROSTRA, or The Beaks, was the name applied to the stage (_suggestus_)\r\nin the Forum, from which the orators addressed the people. This\r\nstage was originally called _templum_, because it was consecrated by\r\nthe augurs, but obtained its name of _Rostra_ at the conclusion of\r\nthe great Latin war, when it was adorned with the beaks (_rostra_)\r\nof the ships of the Antiates. The Greeks also mutilated galleys in\r\nthe same way for the purpose of trophies: this was called by them\r\nἀκρωτηριάζειν. [ACROTERIUM.] The rostra lay between the Comitium or\r\nplace of meeting for the curies, and the Forum or place of meeting\r\nfor the tribes, so that the speaker might turn either to the one or\r\nthe other; but down to the time of C. Gracchus, even the tribunes\r\nin speaking used to front the Comitium; he first turned his back\r\nto it and spoke with his face towards the forum. The rostra was a\r\ncircular building, raised on arches, with a stand or platform on the\r\ntop, bordered by a parapet, the access to it being by two flights of\r\nsteps, one on each side. It fronted towards the comitium, and the\r\nrostra were affixed to the front of it, just under the arches. Its\r\nform has been in all the main points preserved in the ambones or\r\ncircular pulpits of the most ancient churches, which also had two\r\nflights of steps leading up to them, one on the east side, by which\r\nthe preacher ascended, and another on the west side, for his descent.\r\nThe speaker was thus enabled to walk to and fro, while addressing his\r\naudience. The suggestus or rostra was transferred by Julius Caesar\r\nto a corner of the Forum, but the spot where the ancient rostra had\r\nstood still continued to be called _Rostra Vetera_, while the other\r\nwas called _Rostra Nova_ or _Rostra Julia_. Both the rostra contained\r\nstatues of illustrious men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rostra on Coin of M. Lollius Palicanus. (British\r\nMuseum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nROSTRUM. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRŎTA. [CURRUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRŬDĬĀRĬI. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRŬDIS. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSACCUS (σάκκος) signified in general any kind of sack or bag made\r\nof hair, cloth, or other materials. We have only to notice here its\r\nmeaning as--(1) A head-dress. [COMA.]--(2) A sieve for straining\r\nwine. [COLUM.]--(3) A purse for holding money. Hence the phrase in\r\nPlautus _ire ad saccum_, “to go a begging.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂCELLUM is a diminutive of _sacer_, and signifies a small place\r\nconsecrated to a god, containing an altar, and sometimes also a\r\nstatue of the god to whom it was dedicated, but it was without a\r\nroof. It was therefore a sacred inclosure surrounded by a fence or\r\nwall, and thus answered to the Greek περίβολος.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂCERDOS, SĂCERDŌTĬUM. As all the different kinds of priests are\r\ntreated of separately in this work, it is only necessary here to\r\nmake some general remarks. In comparison with the civil magistrates,\r\nall priests at Rome were regarded as _homines privati_, though all\r\nof them, as priests, were sacerdotes publici, in as far as their\r\noffice (_sacerdotium_) was connected with any worship recognised\r\nby the state. The appellation of _sacerdos publicus_ was, however,\r\ngiven principally to the chief pontiff and the flamen dialis, who\r\nwere at the same time the only priests who were members of the senate\r\nby virtue of their office. All priestly offices or sacerdotia were\r\nheld for life, without responsibility to any civil magistrate. A\r\npriest was generally allowed to hold any other civil or military\r\noffice besides his priestly dignity; some priests, however, formed an\r\nexception, for the duumviri, the rex sacrorum, and the flamen dialis\r\nwere not allowed to hold any state office, and were also exempt\r\nfrom service in the armies. Their priestly character was, generally\r\nspeaking, inseparable from their person as long as they lived: hence\r\nthe augurs and fratres arvales retained their character even when\r\nsent into exile, or when they were taken prisoners. It also occurs\r\nthat one and the same person held two or three priestly offices at a\r\ntime. Thus we find the three dignities of pontifex maximus, augur,\r\nand decemvir sacrorum united in one individual. Bodily defects\r\nincapacitated a person at Rome, as among all ancient nations, from\r\nholding any priestly office. All priests were originally patricians,\r\nbut from the year B.C. 367 the plebeians also began to take part\r\nin the sacerdotia [PLEBES]; and those priestly offices which down\r\nto the latest times remained in the hands of the patricians alone,\r\nsuch as that of the rex sacrorum, the flamines, salii, and others,\r\nhad no influence upon the affairs of the state. As regards the\r\nappointment of priests, the ancients unanimously state, that at first\r\nthey were appointed by the kings, but after the sacerdotia were\r\nonce instituted, each college of priests--for nearly all priests\r\nconstituted certain corporations called collegia--had the right of\r\nfilling up, by cooptatio, the vacancies which occurred. [PONTIFEX.]\r\nOther priests, on the contrary, such as the vestal virgins and the\r\nflamines, were appointed (_capiebantur_) by the pontifex maximus, a\r\nrule which appears to have been observed down to the latest times;\r\nothers again, such as the duumviri sacrorum, were elected by the\r\npeople, or by the curiae, as the curiones. But in whatever manner\r\nthey were appointed, all priests after their appointment required\r\nto be inaugurated by the pontiffs and the augurs, or by the latter\r\nalone. Those priests who formed colleges had originally, as we have\r\nalready observed, the right of cooptatio; but in the course of\r\ntime they were deprived of this right, or at least the cooptatio\r\nwas reduced to a mere form, by several leges, called leges de\r\nsacerdotiis, such as the Lex Domitia, Cornelia, and Julia; their\r\nnature is described in the article PONTIFEX, and what is there said\r\nin regard to the appointment of pontiffs applies equally to all the\r\nother colleges. All priests had some external distinction, as the\r\napex, tutulus, or galerus, the toga praetexta, as well as honorary\r\nseats in the theatres, circuses, and amphitheatres. Most of the\r\npriestly colleges possessed landed property, and some priests had\r\nalso a regular annual salary (_stipendium_), which was paid to them\r\nfrom the public treasury. This is expressly stated in regard to the\r\nvestal virgins, the augurs, and the curiones, and may therefore be\r\nsupposed to have been the case with other priests also. The pontifex\r\nmaximus, the rex sacrorum, and the vestal virgins had moreover a\r\ndomus publica as their place of residence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRA. This word, in its widest sense, expresses what we call\r\ndivine worship. In ancient times, the state, as well as all its\r\nsubdivisions, had their own peculiar forms of worship, whence at\r\nRome we find sacra of the whole Roman people, of the curies, gentes,\r\nfamilies, and even of private individuals. All these sacra, however,\r\nwere divided into two great classes, the public and private sacra\r\n(_sacra publica et privata_), that is, they were performed either on\r\nbehalf of the whole nation, and at the expense of the state, or on\r\nbehalf of individuals, families, or gentes, which had also to defray\r\ntheir expenses. This division is ascribed to Numa. All sacra, publica\r\nas well as privata, were superintended and regulated by the pontiffs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRĀMENTUM, the military oath, which was administered in the\r\nfollowing manner:--Each tribunus militum assembled his legion, and\r\npicked out one of the men, to whom he put the oath, that he would\r\nobey the commands of his generals, and execute them punctually. The\r\nother men then came forward, one after another, and repeated the same\r\noath, saying that they would do like the first.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRĀRĬUM was any place in which sacred things were deposited and\r\nkept, whether this place was a part of a temple or of a private house.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRIFĬCĬUM (ἱερεῖον), a sacrifice. Sacrifices or offerings formed\r\nthe chief part of the worship of the ancients. They were partly\r\nsigns of gratitude, partly a means of propitiating the gods, and\r\npartly also intended to induce the deity to bestow some favour\r\nupon the sacrificer, or upon those on whose behalf the sacrifice\r\nwas offered. Sacrifices in a wider sense would also embrace the\r\nDONARIA; in a narrower sense sacrificia were things offered to the\r\ngods, which merely afforded momentary gratification, and which\r\nwere burnt upon their altars, or were believed to be consumed by\r\nthe gods. All sacrifices may be divided into bloody sacrifices and\r\nunbloody sacrifices.--_Bloody sacrifices._ In the early times of\r\nGreece we find mention of human sacrifices, but with a few exceptions\r\nthese had ceased in the historical ages. Owing to the influence\r\nof civilisation, in many cases animals were substituted for human\r\nbeings; in others, a few drops of human blood were thought sufficient\r\nto propitiate the gods. The custom of sacrificing human life to the\r\ngods arose from the belief that the nobler the sacrifice and the\r\ndearer to its possessor, the more pleasing it would be to the gods.\r\nHence the frequent instances in Grecian story of persons sacrificing\r\ntheir own children, or of persons devoting themselves to the gods of\r\nthe lower world. That the Romans also believed human sacrifices to\r\nbe pleasing to the gods, might be inferred from the story of Curtius\r\nand from the self-sacrifice of the Decii. The symbolic sacrifice\r\nof human figures made of rushes at the Lemuralia [LEMURALIA] also\r\nshows that in the early history of Italy human sacrifices were not\r\nuncommon. For another proof of this practice, see VER SACRUM. A\r\nsecond kind of bloody sacrifices were those of animals of various\r\nkinds, according to the nature and character of the divinity. The\r\nsacrifices of animals were the most common among the Greeks and\r\nRomans. The victim was called ἱερεῖον, and in Latin _hostia_ or\r\n_victima_. In the early times it appears to have been the general\r\ncustom to burn the whole victim (ὁλοκαυτεῖν) upon the altars of the\r\ngods, and the same was in some cases also observed in later times.\r\nBut as early as the time of Homer it was the almost general practice\r\nto burn only the legs (μηροί, μηρία, μῆρα) enclosed in fat, and\r\ncertain parts of the intestines, while the remaining parts of the\r\nvictim were consumed by men at a festive meal. The gods delighted\r\nchiefly in the smoke arising from the burning victims, and the\r\ngreater the number of victims, the more pleasing was the sacrifice.\r\nHence it was not uncommon to offer a sacrifice of one hundred bulls\r\n(ἑκατόμβη) at once, though it must not be supposed that a hecatomb\r\nalways signifies a sacrifice of a hundred bulls, for the name was\r\nused in a general way to designate any great sacrifice. Such great\r\nsacrifices were not less pleasing to men than to the gods, for in\r\nregard to the former they were in reality a donation of meat. Hence\r\nat Athens the partiality for such sacrifices rose to the highest\r\ndegree. The animals which were sacrificed were mostly of the domestic\r\nkind, as bulls, cows, sheep, rams, lambs, goats, pigs, dogs, and\r\nhorses; and each god had his favourite animals which he liked best\r\nas sacrifices. The head of the victim, before it was killed, was in\r\nmost cases strewed with roasted barley meal (οὐλόχυτα or οὐλοχύται)\r\nmixed with salt (_mola salsa_). The persons who offered the sacrifice\r\nwore generally garlands round their heads, and sometimes also carried\r\nthem in their hands, and before they touched anything belonging to\r\nthe sacrifice they washed their hands in water. The victim itself\r\nwas likewise adorned with garlands, and its horns were sometimes\r\ngilt. Before the animal was killed, a bunch of hair was cut from its\r\nforehead, and thrown into the fire as primitiae (κατάρχεσθαι). In the\r\nheroic ages the princes, as the high priests of their people, killed\r\nthe victim; in later times this was done by the priests themselves.\r\nWhen the sacrifice was to be offered to the Olympic gods, the head\r\nof the animal was drawn heavenward; when to the gods of the lower\r\nworld, to heroes, or to the dead, it was drawn downwards. While the\r\nflesh was burning upon the altar, wine and incense were thrown upon\r\nit, and prayers and music accompanied the solemnity. The most common\r\nanimal sacrifices at Rome were the _suovetaurilia_ or _solitaurilia_,\r\nconsisting of a pig, a sheep, and an ox. They were performed in all\r\ncases of a lustration, and the victims were carried around the thing\r\nto be lustrated, whether it was a city, a people, or a piece of land.\r\n[LUSTRATIO.] The Greek _trittya_ (τριττύα), which likewise consisted\r\nof an ox, a sheep, and a pig, was the same sacrifice as the Roman\r\nsuovetaurilia. The customs observed before and during the sacrifice\r\nof an animal were on the whole the same as those observed in Greece.\r\nBut the victim was in most cases not killed by the priests who\r\nconducted the sacrifice, but by a person called _popa_, who struck\r\nthe animal with a hammer before the knife was used. The better parts\r\nof the intestines (_exta_) were strewed with barley meal, wine, and\r\nincense, and were burnt upon the altar. Those parts of the animal\r\nwhich were burnt were called _prosecta_, _prosiciae_, or _ablegmina_.\r\nWhen a sacrifice was offered to gods of rivers, or of the sea, these\r\nparts were not burnt, but thrown into the water. Respecting the use\r\nwhich the ancients made of sacrifices to learn the will of the gods,\r\nsee HARUSPEX and DIVINATIO.--_Unbloody sacrifices._ Among these we\r\nmay first mention the libations (_libationes_, λοιβαί or σπονδαί).\r\nBloody sacrifices were usually accompanied by libations, as wine was\r\npoured upon them. The wine was usually poured out in three separate\r\nstreams. Libations always accompanied a sacrifice which was offered\r\nin concluding a treaty with a foreign nation, and that here they\r\nformed a prominent part of the solemnity, is clear from the fact that\r\nthe treaty itself was called σπονδαί. But libations were also made\r\nindependent of any other sacrifice, as in solemn prayers, and on\r\nmany other occasions of public and private life, as before drinking\r\nat meals, and the like. Libations usually consisted of unmixed wine\r\n(ἔνσπονδος, _merum_), but sometimes also of milk, honey, and other\r\nfluids, either pure or diluted with water. The libations offered\r\nto the Furies were always without wine. Incense was likewise an\r\noffering which usually accompanied bloody sacrifices, but it was\r\nalso burned as an offering for itself. A third class of unbloody\r\nsacrifices consisted of fruit and cakes. The former were mostly\r\noffered to the gods as primitiae or tithes of the harvest, and as\r\na sign of gratitude. They were sometimes offered in their natural\r\nstate, sometimes also adorned or prepared in various ways. Cakes were\r\npeculiar to the worship of certain deities, as to that of Apollo.\r\nThey were either simple cakes of flour, sometimes also of wax, or\r\nthey were made in the shape of some animal, and were then offered as\r\nsymbolical sacrifices in the place of real animals, either because\r\nthey could not easily be procured, or were too expensive for the\r\nsacrificer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRĬLĔGĬUM, the crime of stealing things consecrated to the gods,\r\nor things deposited in a consecrated place. A Lex Julia appears to\r\nhave placed the crime of sacrilegium on an equality with peculatus.\r\n[PECULATUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAECŬLUM was, according to the calculation of the Etruscans, which\r\nwas adopted by the Romans, a space of time containing 110 lunar\r\nyears. The return of each saeculum at Rome was announced by the\r\npontiffs, who also made the necessary intercalations in such a\r\nmanner, that at the commencement of a new saeculum the beginning of\r\nthe ten months’ year, of the twelve months’ year, and of the solar\r\nyear coincided. But in these arrangements the greatest caprice and\r\nirregularity appear to have prevailed at Rome, as may be seen from\r\nthe unequal intervals at which the ludi saeculares were celebrated.\r\n[LUDI SAECULARES.] This also accounts for the various ways in which a\r\nsaeculum was defined by the ancients; some believed that it contained\r\nthirty, and others that it contained a hundred years: the latter\r\nopinion appears to have been the most common in later times, so that\r\nsaeculum answered to our century.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂGITTĀRĬI. [ARCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGMĬNA, were the same as the _verbenae_, namely, herbs torn up by\r\ntheir roots from within the inclosure of the Capitoline, which were\r\nalways carried by the Fetiales or ambassadors, when they went to a\r\nforeign people to demand restitution for wrongs committed against\r\nthe Romans, or to make a treaty. [FETIALES.] They served to mark the\r\nsacred character of the ambassadors, and answered the same purpose as\r\nthe Greek κηρύκεια.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂGUM, the cloak worn by the Roman soldiers and inferior officers,\r\nin contradistinction to the paludamentum of the general and superior\r\nofficers. [PALUDAMENTUM.] It is used in opposition to the toga or\r\ngarb of peace, and we accordingly find, that when there was a war\r\nin Italy, all citizens put on the sagum even in the city, with the\r\nexception of those of consular rank (_saga sumere_, _ad saga ire_,\r\n_in sagis esse_). The sagum was open in the front, and usually\r\nfastened across the shoulders by a clasp: it resembled in form the\r\npaludamentum (see cut, p. 281). The cloak worn by the general and\r\nsuperior officers is sometimes called _sagum_, but the diminutive\r\n_sagulum_ is more commonly used in such cases. The cloak worn by the\r\nnorthern nations of Europe is also called sagum. The German sagum is\r\nmentioned by Tacitus: that worn by the Gauls seems to have been a\r\nspecies of plaid (_versicolor sagum_).\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂLĂMINĬA. [PARALUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂLĬI, priests of Mars Gradivus, said to have been instituted by\r\nNuma. They were twelve in number, chosen from the patricians even\r\nin the latest times, and formed an ecclesiastical corporation. They\r\nhad the care of the twelve Ancilia, which were kept in the temple of\r\nMars on the Palatine hill, whence these priests were sometimes called\r\nSalii Palatini, to distinguish them from the other Salii mentioned\r\nbelow. The distinguishing dress of the Salii was an embroidered tunic\r\nbound with a brazen belt, the trabea, and the apex, also worn by the\r\nFlamines. [APEX.] Each had a sword by his side, and in his right hand\r\na spear or staff. The festival of Mars was celebrated by the Salii on\r\nthe 1st of March and for several successive days; on which occasion\r\nthey were accustomed to go through the city in their official dress,\r\ncarrying the ancilia in their left hands or suspended from their\r\nshoulders, and at the same time singing and dancing, whence comes\r\ntheir name. The songs or hymns which they sang on this occasion were\r\ncalled _Asamenta, ssamenta_, or _Axamenta_, and were chiefly in\r\npraise of Mamurius Veturius, generally said to be the armourer, who\r\nmade eleven ancilia like the one that was sent from heaven (ancile),\r\nthough some modern writers suppose it to be merely another name of\r\nMars. The praises of the gods were also celebrated in the songs\r\nof the Salii. In later times these songs were scarcely understood\r\neven by the priests themselves. At the conclusion of the festival\r\nthe Salii were accustomed to partake of a splendid entertainment in\r\nthe temple of Mars, which was proverbial for its excellence. The\r\nmembers of the collegium were elected by co-optation. We read of the\r\ndignities of praesul, vates, and magister in the collegium. The shape\r\nof the ancile is exhibited in the annexed cut, which illustrates the\r\naccounts of the ancient writers that its form was oval, but with the\r\ntwo sides receding inwards with an even curvature, and so as to make\r\nit broader at the ends than in the middle. The persons engaged in\r\ncarrying these ancilia on their shoulders, suspended from a pole, are\r\nprobably servants of the Salii. At the top of the cut is represented\r\none of the rods with which the Salii were accustomed to beat the\r\nshield in their dance, as already described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Salii carrying the Ancilia. (From an ancient Gem.)]\r\n\r\nTullus Hostilius established another collegium of Salii, in\r\nfulfilment of a vow which he made in a war with the Sabines. These\r\nSalii were also twelve in number, chosen from the patricians, and\r\nappear to have been dedicated to the service of Quirinus. They were\r\ncalled the Salii Collini, Agonales or Agonenses. It is supposed that\r\nthe oldest and most illustrious college, the Palatine Salii, were\r\nchosen originally from the oldest tribe, the Ramnes, and the one\r\ninstituted by Tullus Hostilius, or the Quirinalian, from the Tities\r\nalone: a third college for the Luceres was never established.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂLĪNAE (ἁλαὶ, ἁλοπήγιον), a salt-work. Throughout the Roman empire\r\nthe salt-works were commonly public property, and were let by the\r\ngovernment to the highest bidder. The first salt-works are said to\r\nhave been established by Ancus Marcius at Ostia. The publicani who\r\nfarmed these works appear to have sold this most necessary of all\r\ncommodities at a very high price, whence the censors M. Livius and\r\nC. Claudius (B.C. 204) fixed the price at which those who took the\r\nlease of them were obliged to sell the salt to the people. At Rome\r\nthe medius was, according to this regulation, sold for a sextans,\r\nwhile in other parts of Italy the price was higher and varied. The\r\nsalt-works in Italy and in the provinces were very numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂLĪNUM, a salt-cellar. All Romans who were raised above poverty\r\nhad one of silver, which descended from father to son, and was\r\naccompanied by a silver plate, which was used together with the\r\nsalt-cellar in the domestic sacrifices. [PATERA.] These two articles\r\nof silver were alone compatible with the simplicity of Roman manners\r\nin the early times of the republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Dance. (Lamberti, Villa Borghese.)]\r\n\r\nSALTĀTĬO (ὄρχησις, ὀρχηστύς), dancing. The dancing of the Greeks as\r\nwell as of the Romans had very little in common with the exercise\r\nwhich goes by that name in modern times. It may be divided into two\r\nkinds, gymnastic and mimetic; that is, it was intended either to\r\nrepresent bodily activity, or to express by gestures, movements,\r\nand attitudes certain ideas or feelings, and also single events, or\r\na series of events, as in the modern ballet. All these movements,\r\nhowever, were accompanied by music; but the terms ὄρχησις and\r\n_saltatio_ were used in so much wider a sense than our word dancing,\r\nthat they were applied to designate gestures, even when the body did\r\nnot move at all. We find dancing prevalent among the Greeks from the\r\nearliest times. It was originally closely connected with religion.\r\nIn all the public festivals, which were so numerous among the Greeks,\r\ndancing formed a very prominent part. We find from the earliest times\r\nthat the worship of Apollo was connected with a religious dance,\r\ncalled _Hyporchema_ (ὑπόρχημα). All the religious dances, with the\r\nexception of the Bacchic and the Corybantian, were very simple, and\r\nconsisted of gentle movements of the body, with various turnings and\r\nwindings around the altar: such a dance was the _Geranus_ (γέρανος),\r\nwhich Theseus is said to have performed at Delos on his return from\r\nCrete. The Dionysiac or Bacchic, and the Corybantian, were of a very\r\ndifferent nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corybantian Dance. (Visconti, Mus. Pio Clem., vol. iv.\r\ntav. 9.)]\r\n\r\nIn the former the life and adventures of the god were represented\r\nby mimetic dancing. [DIONYSIA.] The Corybantian was of a very wild\r\ncharacter: it was chiefly danced in Phrygia and in Crete; the dancers\r\nwere armed, struck their swords against their shields, and displayed\r\nthe most extravagant fury; it was accompanied chiefly by the flute.\r\nRespecting the dances in the theatre, see CHORUS. Dancing was applied\r\nto gymnastic purposes and to training for war, especially in the\r\nDoric states, and was believed to have contributed very much to the\r\nsuccess of the Dorians in war, as it enabled them to perform their\r\nevolutions simultaneously and in order. There were various dances\r\nin early times, which served as a preparation for war: hence Homer\r\ncalls the Hoplites πρυλέες, a war-dance having been called πρύλις by\r\nthe Cretans. Of such dances the most celebrated was the Pyrrhic (ἡ\r\nπυῤῥίχη), of which the πρύλις was probably only another name. It was\r\ndanced to the sound of the flute, and its time was very quick and\r\nlight, as is shown by the name of the Pyrrhic foot (˘˘), which must\r\nbe connected with this dance. In the non-Doric states it was probably\r\nnot practised as a training for war, but only as a mimetic dance:\r\nthus we read of its being danced by women to entertain a company. It\r\nwas also performed at Athens at the greater and lesser Panathenaea\r\nby ephebi, who were called Pyrrhichists (πυῤῥιχισταί), and were\r\ntrained at the expense of the choragus. In the mountainous parts of\r\nThessaly and Macedon dances are performed at the present day by men\r\narmed with muskets and swords. The Pyrrhic dance was introduced in\r\nthe public games at Rome by Julius Caesar, when it was danced by the\r\nchildren of the leading men in Asia and Bithynia. There were other\r\ndances, besides the PYRRHIC, in which the performers had arms; but\r\nthese seem to have been entirely mimetic, and not practised with any\r\nview to training for war. Such was the _Carpaea_ (καρπαία), peculiar\r\nto the Aenianians and Magnetes, and described by Xenophon in the\r\nAnabasis. Such dances were frequently performed at banquets for the\r\nentertainment of the guests, where also the tumblers (κυβιστῆρες)\r\nwere often introduced, who in the course of their dance flung\r\nthemselves on their head and alighted again upon their feet. These\r\ntumblers were also accustomed to make their somersets over knives and\r\nswords, which was called κυβιστάν εἰς μαχαίρας. We learn from Tacitus\r\nthat the German youths also used to dance among swords and spears\r\npointed at them. Other kinds of dances were frequently performed at\r\nentertainments, in Rome as well as in Greece, by courtezans, many of\r\nwhich were of a very indecent and lascivious nature. Among the dances\r\nperformed without arms one of the most important was the _Hormos_\r\n(ὅρμος), which was danced at Sparta by youths and maidens together:\r\nthe youth danced first some movements suited to his age, and of a\r\nmilitary nature; the maiden followed in measured steps and with\r\nfeminine gestures. Another common dance at Sparta was the _bibasis_\r\n(βίβασις), in which the dancer sprang rapidly from the ground and\r\nstruck the feet behind.--Dancing was common among the Romans in\r\nancient times, in connection with religious festivals and rites,\r\nbecause the ancients thought that no part of the body should be free\r\nfrom the influence of religion. The dances of the Salii, which were\r\nperformed by men of patrician families, are described elsewhere.\r\n[ANCILE.] Dancing, however, was not performed by any Roman citizens\r\nexcept in connection with religion, and it was considered disgraceful\r\nfor any freeman to dance. The mimetic dances of the Romans, which\r\nwere carried to such perfection under the empire, are described under\r\nPANTOMIMUS. The dancers on the tight-rope (_funambuli_) under the\r\nempire were as skilful as they are in the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tumbler. (Museo Borbonico, vol. VII. tav. 58.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂLŪTATŌRES, the name given in the later times of the republic, and\r\nunder the empire, to a class of men who obtained their living by\r\nvisiting the houses of the wealthy early in the morning, to pay their\r\nrespects to them (_salutare_), and to accompany them when they went\r\nabroad. This arose from the visits which the clients were accustomed\r\nto pay to their patrons, and degenerated in later times into the\r\nabove-mentioned practice: such persons seem to have obtained a good\r\nliving among the great number of wealthy and vain persons at Rome,\r\nwho were gratified by this attention. [SPORTULA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMBŪCA (σαμβύκη), a harp, was of oriental origin. The performances\r\nof _sambucistriae_ (σαμβυκίστριαι) were only known to the early\r\nRomans as luxuries brought over from Asia. _Sambuca_ was also the\r\nname of a military engine, used to scale the walls and towers of\r\nbesieged cities. It was called by this name on account of its general\r\nresemblance to the form of a harp.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMNĪTES. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDĂLĬUM (σανδάλιον or σάνδαλον), a kind of shoe worn only by women.\r\nThe sandalium must be distinguished from the _hypodema_ (ὑπόδημα),\r\nwhich was a simple sole bound under the foot, whereas the sandalium\r\nwas a sole with a piece of leather covering the toes, so that it\r\nformed the transition from the _hypodema_ to real shoes. The piece of\r\nleather over the toes was called ζυγός or ζυγόν.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDĂPĬLA. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSARCŎPHĂGUS. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSARISSA. [HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSARRĀCUM, a kind of common cart or waggon, which was used by the\r\ncountry-people of Italy for conveying the produce of their fields,\r\ntrees, and the like, from one place to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĂTŬRA, the root of which is _sat_, literally means a mixture of\r\nall sorts of things. The name was accordingly applied by the Romans\r\nin many ways, but always to things consisting of various parts or\r\ningredients, _e.g._ _lanx satura_, an offering consisting of various\r\nfruits, such as were offered at harvest festivals and to Ceres; _lex\r\nper saturam lata_, a law which contained several distinct regulations\r\nat once, and to a species of poetry, afterwards called _Satira_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĀTURNĀLĬA, the festival of Saturnus, to whom the inhabitants of\r\nLatium attributed the introduction of agriculture and the arts of\r\ncivilized life. Falling towards the end of December, at the season\r\nwhen the agricultural labours of the year were fully completed, it\r\nwas celebrated in ancient times by the rustic population as a sort\r\nof joyous harvest-home, and in every age was viewed by all classes\r\nof the community as a period of absolute relaxation and unrestrained\r\nmerriment. During its continuance no public business could be\r\ntransacted, the law courts were closed, the schools kept holiday,\r\nto commence a war was impious, to punish a malefactor involved\r\npollution. Special indulgences were granted to the slaves of each\r\ndomestic establishment; they were relieved from all ordinary toils,\r\nwere permitted to wear the _pileus_, the badge of freedom, were\r\ngranted full freedom of speech, and partook of a banquet attired in\r\nthe clothes of their masters, and were waited upon by them at table.\r\nAll ranks devoted themselves to feasting and mirth, presents were\r\ninterchanged among friends, _cerei_ or wax tapers being the common\r\noffering of the more humble to their superiors, and crowds thronged\r\nthe streets, shouting, _Io Saturnalia_ (this was termed _clamare\r\nSaturnalia_), while sacrifices were offered with uncovered head,\r\nfrom a conviction that no ill-omened sight would interrupt the rites\r\nof such a happy day. Many of the peculiar customs of this festival\r\nexhibit a remarkable resemblance to the sports of our own Christmas\r\nand of the Italian Carnival. Thus on the Saturnalia public gambling\r\nwas allowed by the aediles, just as in the days of our ancestors the\r\nmost rigid were wont to countenance card-playing on Christmas-eve;\r\nthe whole population threw off the toga, wore a loose gown, called\r\n_synthesis_, and walked about with the pileus on their heads, which\r\nreminds us of the dominos, the peaked caps, and other disguises worn\r\nby masques and mummers; the _cerei_ were probably employed as the\r\n_moccoli_ now are on the last night of the Carnival; and lastly,\r\none of the amusements in private society was the election of a mock\r\nking, which at once calls to recollection the characteristic ceremony\r\nof Twelfth-night. During the republic, although the whole month of\r\nDecember was considered as dedicated to Saturn, only one day, the\r\nXIV. Kal. Jan., was set apart for the sacred rites of the divinity.\r\nWhen the month was lengthened by the addition of two days upon the\r\nadoption of the Julian Calendar, the Saturnalia fell on the XVI.\r\nKal. Jan., which gave rise to confusion and mistakes among the more\r\nignorant portion of the people. To obviate this inconvenience, and\r\nallay all religious scruples, Augustus enacted that three whole days,\r\nthe 17th, 18th, and 19th of December, should in all time coming be\r\nhallowed, thus embracing both the old and new style. Under the empire\r\nthe merry-making lasted for seven days, and three different festivals\r\nwere celebrated during this period. First came the _Saturnalia_\r\nproper, commencing on XVI. Kal. Dec., followed by the _Opalia_,\r\nanciently coincident with the Saturnalia, on XIV. Kal. Jan.; these\r\ntwo together lasted for five days, and the sixth and seventh were\r\noccupied with the _Sigillaria_, so called from little earthenware\r\nfigures (_sigilla_, _oscilla_) exposed for sale at this season, and\r\ngiven as toys to children.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALPTŪRA or SCULPTŪRA, originally signified cutting figures out of\r\na solid material, but was more particularly applied to the art of\r\ncutting figures into the material (intaglios), which was chiefly\r\napplied to producing seals and matrices for the mints; and 2. the\r\nart of producing raised figures (cameos), which served for the most\r\npart as ornaments. _Sculpture_ in our sense of the word was usually\r\ndesignated by the term STATUARIA. The first artist who is mentioned\r\nas an engraver of stones is Theodoras, the son of Telecles, the\r\nSamian, who engraved the stone in the ring of Polycrates. The most\r\ncelebrated among them was Pyrgoteles, who engraved the seal-rings\r\nfor Alexander the Great. Several of the successors of Alexander and\r\nother wealthy persons adopted the custom of adorning their gold and\r\nsilver vessels, craters, candelabras, and the like, with precious\r\nstones on which raised figures (cameos) were worked. The art was\r\nin a particularly flourishing state at Rome under Augustus and his\r\nsuccessors, in the hands of Dioscurides and other artists, many of\r\nwhose works are still preserved. Numerous specimens of intaglios and\r\ncameos are still preserved in the various museums of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCAMNUM, _dim._ SCĂBELLTUM, a step which was placed before the beds\r\nof the ancients in order to assist persons in getting into them, as\r\nsome were very high: others which were lower required also lower\r\nsteps, which were called _scabella_. A scamnum was also used as a\r\nfootstool. A scamnum extended in length becomes a bench, and in\r\nthis sense the word is frequently used. The benches in ships were\r\nsometimes called scamna.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCĒNA. [THEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCEPTRUM (σκῆπτρον), which originally denoted a simple staff or\r\nwalking-stick, was emblematic of station and authority. In ancient\r\nauthors the sceptre is represented as belonging more especially\r\nto kings, princes, and leaders of tribes: but it is also borne by\r\njudges, by heralds, and by priests and seers. The sceptre descended\r\nfrom father to son, and might be committed to any one in order to\r\nexpress the transfer of authority. Those who bore the sceptre swore\r\nby it, solemnly taking it in the right hand and raising it towards\r\nheaven. The ivory sceptre of the kings of Rome, which descended to\r\nthe consuls, was surmounted by an eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOENUS (ὁ, ἡ, σχοῖνος), an Egyptian and Persian measure, the length\r\nof which is stated by Herodotus at 60 stadia, or 2 parasangs. It was\r\nused especially for measuring land.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCORPĬO. [TORMENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRĪBAE, public notaries or clerks, in the pay of the Roman state.\r\nThey were chiefly employed in making up the public accounts,\r\ncopying out laws, and recording the proceedings of the different\r\nfunctionaries of the state. The phrase _scriptum facere_ was used\r\nto denote their occupation. Being very numerous, they were divided\r\ninto companies or classes (_decuriae_), and were assigned by lot to\r\ndifferent magistrates, whence they were named Quaestorii, Aedilicii,\r\nor Praetorii, from the officers of state to whom they were attached.\r\nThe appointment to the office of a “scriba” seems to have been\r\neither made on the nomination of a magistrate, or purchased. Horace,\r\nfor instance, bought for himself a “patent place as clerk in the\r\ntreasury” (_scriptum quaestorium comparavit_). In Cicero’s time,\r\nindeed, it seems that any one might become a scriba or public clerk\r\nby purchase, and consequently, as freedmen and their sons were\r\neligible, and constituted a great portion of the public clerks at\r\nRome, the office was not highly esteemed, though frequently held by\r\ningenui or free-born citizens. Very few instances are recorded of\r\nthe scribae being raised to the higher dignities of the state. Cn.\r\nFlavius, the scribe of Appius Claudius, was raised to the office of\r\ncurule aedile in gratitude for his making public the various forms\r\nof actions, which had previously been the exclusive property of the\r\npatricians [ACTIO]; but the returning officer refused to acquiesce in\r\nhis election till he had given up his books and left his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRĪNĬUM. [CAPSA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRIPTA DUŎDĔCIM. [LATRUNCULI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRIPTŪRA, that part of the revenue of the Roman Republic which was\r\nderived from letting out, as pasture land, those portions of the\r\nager publicus which were not taken into cultivation. The names for\r\nsuch parts of the ager publicus were, _pascua publica_, _saltus_,\r\nor _silvae_. They were let by the censors to the publicani, like\r\nall other vectigalia; and the persons who sent their cattle to\r\ngraze on such public pastures had to pay a certain tax or duty to\r\nthe publicani, which of course varied according to the number and\r\nquality of the cattle which they kept upon them. The publicani had\r\nto keep the lists of persons who sent their cattle upon the public\r\npastures, together with the number and quality of the cattle. From\r\nthis registering (_scribere_) the duty itself was called _scriptura_,\r\nthe public pasture land _ager scripturarius_, and the publicani, or\r\ntheir agents who raised the tax, _scripturarii_. The Lex Thoria (B.C.\r\n111) did away with the scriptura in Italy, where the public pastures\r\nwere very numerous and extensive, especially in Apulia, and the lands\r\nthemselves were now sold or distributed. In the provinces, where the\r\npublic pastures were also let out in the same manner, the practice\r\ncontinued until the time of the empire; but afterwards the scriptura\r\nis no longer mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRŪPŬLUM, or more properly SCRIPULUM or SCRIPLUM (γράμμα), the\r\nsmallest denomination of weight among the Romans. It was the 24th\r\npart of the UNCIA, or the 288th of the LIBRA, and therefore = 18·06\r\ngrains English, which is about the average weight of the scrupular\r\naurei still in existence. [AURUM.] As a square measure, it was the\r\nsmallest division of the jugerum, which contained 288 scrupula.\r\n[JUGERUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCŪTUM (θυρεός), the Roman shield worn by the heavy-armed infantry,\r\ninstead of being round, like the Greek CLIPEUS, was adapted to the\r\nform of the human body, by being made either oval or of the shape\r\nof a door, (θύρα), which it also resembled in being made of wood or\r\nwicker-work, and from which consequently its Greek name was derived.\r\nPolybius says that the dimensions of the scutum were 4 feet by 2½.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scuta, shields. (Bartoli, Arcus Triumph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCỸTĂLĒ (σκυτάλη) is the name applied to a secret mode of writing, by\r\nwhich the Spartan ephors communicated with their kings and generals\r\nwhen abroad. When a king or general left Sparta, the ephors gave to\r\nhim a staff of a definite length and thickness, and retained for\r\nthemselves another of precisely the same size. When they had any\r\ncommunications to make to him, they cut the material upon which they\r\nintended to write into the shape of a narrow riband, wound it round\r\ntheir staff, and then wrote upon it the message which they had to\r\nsend to him. When the strip of writing material was taken from the\r\nstaff, nothing but single letters appeared, and in this state the\r\nstrip was sent to the general, who, after having wound it round his\r\nstaff, was able to read the communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCỸTHAE (Σκύθαι). [DEMOSII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĔCESPĬTA, an instrument used by the Roman priests in killing the\r\nvictims at sacrifices, probably an axe. In the annexed coin, the\r\nreverse represents a culter, a simpuvium, and a secespita.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Secespita, Culter, and Simpuvium. (Coin of Sulpicia\r\nGens.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTĬO, the sale of a man’s property by the state (_publice_). This\r\nwas done in consequence of a condemnatio, and for the purpose of\r\nrepayment to the state of such sums of money as the condemned person\r\nhad improperly appropriated; or in consequence of a proscriptio.\r\nSometimes the things sold were called _sectio_. Those who bought the\r\nproperty were called _sectores_. The property was sold _sub hasta_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTOR. [SECTIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĔCŪRIS (ἀξινη, πέλεκυς), an axe or hatchet. The axe was either made\r\nwith a single edge, or with a blade or head on each side of the haft,\r\nthe latter kind being denominated _bipennis_. The axe was used as a\r\nweapon of war chiefly by the Asiatic nations. It was a part of the\r\nRoman fasces. [FASCES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĔCŪTŌRES. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sellae Curules. (The top figure from the Vatican\r\ncollection; the two bottom figures from the Museum at Naples.)]\r\n\r\nSELLA, the general term for a seat or chair of any description.--(1)\r\nSELLA CURULIS, the chair of state. _Curulis_ is derived by the\r\nancient writers from _currus_, but it more probably contains the\r\nsame root as _curia_. The sella curulis is said to have been used at\r\nRome from a very remote period as an emblem of kingly power, having\r\nbeen imported, along with various other insignia of royalty, from\r\nEtruria. Under the republic the right of sitting upon this chair\r\nbelonged to the consuls, praetors, curule aediles, and censors; to\r\nthe flamen dialis; to the dictator, and to those whom he deputed to\r\nact under himself, as the _magister equitum_, since he might be said\r\nto comprehend all magistracies within himself. After the downfall of\r\nthe constitution, it was assigned to the emperors also, or to their\r\nstatues in their absence; to the augustales, and perhaps, to the\r\npraefectus urbi. It was displayed upon all great public occasions,\r\nespecially in the circus and theatre; and it was the seat of the\r\npraetor when he administered justice. In the provinces it was\r\nassumed by inferior magistrates, when they exercised proconsular or\r\npropraetorian authority. We find it occasionally exhibited on the\r\nmedals of foreign monarchs likewise, as on those of Ariobarzanes\r\nII. of Cappadocia, for it was the practice of the Romans to present\r\na curule chair, an ivory sceptre, a toga praetexta, and such-like\r\nornaments, as tokens of respect and confidence to those rulers whose\r\nfriendship they desired to cultivate. The sella curulis appears\r\nfrom the first to have been ornamented with ivory; and at a later\r\nperiod it was overlaid with gold. In shape it was extremely plain,\r\nclosely resembling a common folding camp-stool with crooked legs. The\r\nsella curulis is frequently represented upon the denarii of Roman\r\nfamilies. In the following cut are represented two pair of bronze\r\nlegs, belonging to a sella curulis, and likewise a sella curulis\r\nitself.--(2) SELLA GESTATORIA, or FERTORIA, a sedan used both in\r\ntown and country, and by men as well as by women. It is expressly\r\ndistinguished from the LECTICA, a portable bed or sofa, in which the\r\nperson carried lay in a recumbent position, while the _sella_ was\r\na portable chair, in which the occupant sat upright. It differed\r\nfrom the _cathedra_ also, but in what the difference consisted,\r\nit is not easy to determine. [CATHEDRA.] It appears not to have\r\nbeen introduced until long after the lectica was common, since we\r\nscarcely, if ever, find any allusion to it until the period of the\r\nempire. The sella was sometimes entirely open, but more frequently\r\nshut in. It was made sometimes of plain leather, and sometimes\r\nornamented with bone, ivory, silver, or gold, according to the\r\nfortune of the proprietor. It was furnished with a pillow to support\r\nthe head and neck (_cervical_); the motion was so easy that one might\r\nstudy without inconvenience, while at the same time it afforded a\r\nhealthful exercise.--(3) Chairs for ordinary domestic purposes have\r\nbeen discovered in excavations, or are seen represented in ancient\r\nfrescoes, many displaying great taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sellae, Chairs. (The right-hand figure from the\r\nVatican collection; the left-hand figure from a Painting at Pompeii.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĒMIS, SĒMISSIS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĒMUNCĬA. [UNCIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĒMUNCIĀRĬUM FĒNUS. [FENUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĔNĀTUS. In all the republics of antiquity the government was divided\r\nbetween a senate and a popular assembly; and in cases where a king\r\nstood at the head of affairs, as at Sparta and in early Rome, the\r\nking had little more than the executive. A senate in the early times\r\nwas always regarded as an assembly of elders, which is in fact the\r\nmeaning of the Roman senatus, as of the Spartan (γερουσία), and its\r\nmembers were elected from among the nobles of the nation. The number\r\nof senators in the ancient republics always bore a distinct relation\r\nto the number of tribes of which the nation was composed. [BOULE;\r\nGEROUSIA.] Hence in the earliest times, when Rome consisted of only\r\none tribe, its senate consisted of one hundred members (_senatores_\r\nor _patres_; compare PATRICII), and when the Sabine tribe or the\r\nTities became united with the Latin tribe or the Ramnes, the number\r\nof senators was increased to two hundred. This number was again\r\naugmented to three hundred by Tarquinius Priscus, when the third\r\ntribe or the Luceres became incorporated with the Roman state. The\r\nnew senators added by Tarquinius Priscus were distinguished from\r\nthose belonging to the two older tribes by the appellation _patres\r\nminorum gentium_, as previously those who represented the Tities had\r\nbeen distinguished, by the same name, from those who represented\r\nthe Ramnes. Under Tarquinius Superbus the number of senators is\r\nsaid to have become very much diminished, as he is reported to have\r\nput many to death and sent others into exile. This account however\r\nappears to be greatly exaggerated, and it is probable that several\r\nvacancies in the senate arose from many of the senators accompanying\r\nthe tyrant into his exile. The vacancies which had thus arisen were\r\nfilled up immediately after the establishment of the republic, when\r\nseveral noble plebeians of equestrian rank were made senators. These\r\nnew senators were distinguished from the old ones by the name of\r\n_Conscripti_; and hence the customary mode of addressing the whole\r\nsenate henceforth always was: _Patres Conscripti_, that is, _Patres\r\net Conscripti_.--The number of 300 senators appears to have remained\r\nunaltered for several centuries. The first permanent increase to\r\ntheir number was made by Sulla, and the senate seems henceforth\r\nto have consisted of between five and six hundred. Julius Caesar\r\naugmented the number to 900, and raised to this dignity even common\r\nsoldiers, freedmen, and peregrini. Augustus cleared the senate of\r\nthe unworthy members, who were contemptuously called by the people\r\n_Orcini senatores_, and reduced its number to 600.--In the time\r\nof the kings the senate was probably elected by the gentes, each\r\ngens appointing one member as its representative; and as there\r\nwere 300 gentes, there were consequently 300 senators. The whole\r\nsenate was divided into decuries, each of which corresponded to a\r\ncuria. When the senate consisted of only one hundred members, there\r\nwere accordingly only ten decuries of senators; and ten senators,\r\none being taken from each decury, formed the _Decem Primi_, who\r\nrepresented the ten curies. When subsequently the representatives\r\nof the two other tribes were admitted into the senate, the Ramnes\r\nwith their decem primi retained for a time their superiority over\r\nthe two other tribes, and gave their votes first. The first among\r\nthe decem primi was the _princeps senatus_, who was appointed by\r\nthe king, and was at the same time custos urbis. [PRAEFECTUS URBI.]\r\nRespecting the age at which a person might be elected into the senate\r\nduring the kingly period, we know no more than what is indicated\r\nby the name senator itself, that is, that they were persons of\r\nadvanced age.--Soon after the establishment of the republic, though\r\nat what time is uncertain, the right of appointing senators passed\r\nfrom the gentes into the hands of the consuls, consular tribunes,\r\nand subsequently of the censors. At the same time, the right which\r\nthe magistrates possessed of electing senators was by no means an\r\narbitrary power, for the senators were usually taken from among\r\nthose whom the people had previously invested with a magistracy,\r\nso that in reality the people themselves always nominated the\r\ncandidates for the senate, which on this account remained, as before,\r\na representative assembly. After the institution of the censorship,\r\nthe censors alone had the right of introducing new members into\r\nthe senate from among the ex-magistrates, and of excluding such\r\nas they deemed unworthy. [CENSOR.] The exclusion was effected by\r\nsimply passing over the names, and not entering them on the lists of\r\nsenators, whence such men were called _Praeteriti Senatores_. On one\r\nextraordinary occasion the eldest among the ex-censors was invested\r\nwith dictatorial power for the purpose of filling up vacancies in\r\nthe senate.--As all curule magistrates, and also the quaestors, had\r\nby virtue of their office a seat in the senate, even if they had not\r\nbeen elected senators, we must distinguish between two classes of\r\nsenators, viz., real senators, or such as had been regularly raised\r\nto their dignity by the magistrates or the censors, and such as had,\r\nby virtue of the office which they held or had held, a right to\r\ntake their seats in the senate and to speak (_sententiam dicere_,\r\n_jus sententiae_), but not to vote. To this ordo senatorius also\r\nbelonged the pontifex maximus and the flamen dialis. Though these\r\nsenators had no right to vote, they might, when the real senators\r\nhad voted, step over or join the one or the other party, whence they\r\nwere called _Senatores Pedarii_, an appellation which had in former\r\ntimes been applied to those juniores who were not consulars. When at\r\nlength all the state offices had become equally accessible to the\r\nplebeians and the patricians, and when the majority of offices were\r\nheld by the former, their number in the senate naturally increased in\r\nproportion. The senate had gradually become an assembly representing\r\nthe people, as formerly it had represented the populus, and down to\r\nthe last century of the republic the senatorial dignity was only\r\nregarded as one conferred by the people. But notwithstanding this\r\napparently popular character of the senate, it was never a popular\r\nor democratic assembly, for now its members belonged to the nobiles,\r\nwho were as aristocratic as the patricians. [NOBILES.] The office of\r\nprinceps senatus, which had become independent of that of praetor\r\nurbanus, was now given by the censors, and at first always to the\r\neldest among the ex-censors, but afterwards to any other senator\r\nwhom they thought most worthy; and unless there was any charge to\r\nbe made against him, he was re-elected at the next lustrum. This\r\ndistinction, however, great as it was, afforded neither power nor\r\nadvantages, and did not even confer the privilege of presiding at the\r\nmeetings of the senate, which only belonged to those magistrates who\r\nhad the right of convoking the senate.--During the republican period\r\nno senatorial census existed, although senators naturally always\r\nbelonged to the wealthiest classes. The institution of a census for\r\nsenators belongs to the time of the empire. Augustus first fixed\r\nit at 400,000 sesterces, afterwards increased it to double this\r\nsum, and at last even to 1,200,000 sesterces. Those senators whose\r\nproperty did not amount to this sum received grants from the emperor\r\nto make it up. As regards the age at which a person might become a\r\nsenator, we have no express statement for the time of the republic,\r\nalthough it appears to have been fixed by some custom or law, as\r\nthe aetas senatoria is frequently mentioned, especially during the\r\nlatter period of the republic. But we may by induction discover the\r\nprobable age. We know that, according to the lex annalis of the\r\ntribune Villius, the age fixed for the quaestorship was 31. Now as\r\nit might happen that a quaestor was made a senator immediately after\r\nthe expiration of his office, we may presume that the earliest age\r\nat which a man could become a senator was 32. Augustus at last fixed\r\nthe senatorial age at 25, which appears to have remained unaltered\r\nthroughout the time of the empire.--No senator was allowed to carry\r\non any mercantile business. About the commencement of the second\r\nPunic war, some senators appear to have violated this law or custom,\r\nand in order to prevent its recurrence a law was passed, with the\r\nvehement opposition of the senate, that none of its members should\r\nbe permitted to possess a ship of more than 300 amphorae in tonnage,\r\nas this was thought sufficiently large to convey to Rome the produce\r\nof their estates abroad. It is clear, however, that this law was\r\nfrequently violated.--Regular meetings of the senate (_senatus\r\nlegitimus_) took place during the republic, and probably during the\r\nkingly period also, on the calends, nones, and ides of every month:\r\nextraordinary meetings (_senatus indictus_) might be convoked on any\r\nother day, with the exception of those which were atri, and those on\r\nwhich comitia were held. The right of convoking the senate during the\r\nkingly period belonged to the king, or to his vicegerent, the custos\r\nurbis. This right was during the republic transferred to the curule\r\nmagistrates, and at last to the tribunes also. If a senator did not\r\nappear on a day of meeting, he was liable to a fine, for which a\r\npledge was taken (_pignoris captio_) until it was paid. Towards the\r\nend of the republic it was decreed, that during the whole month of\r\nFebruary the senate should give audience to foreign ambassadors on\r\nall days on which the senate could lawfully meet, and that no other\r\nmatters should be discussed until these affairs were settled.--The\r\nplaces where the meetings of the senate were held (_curiae_,\r\n_senacula_) were always inaugurated by the augurs. [TEMPLUM.] The\r\nmost ancient place was the Curia Hostilia, in which alone originally\r\na senatus-consultum could be made. Afterwards, however, several\r\ntemples were used for this purpose, such as the temple of Concordia,\r\na place near the temple of Bellona [LEGATUS], and one near the porta\r\nCapena. Under the emperors the senate also met in other places: under\r\nCaesar, the Curia Julia, a building of extraordinary splendour, was\r\ncommenced; but subsequently meetings of the senate were frequently\r\nheld in the house of a consul.--The subjects laid before the senate\r\nbelonged partly to the internal affairs of the state, partly to\r\nlegislation, and partly to finance; and no measure could be brought\r\nbefore the populus without having previously been discussed and\r\nprepared by the senate. The senate was thus the medium through which\r\nall affairs of the whole government had to pass: it considered and\r\ndiscussed whatever measures the king thought proper to introduce,\r\nand had, on the other hand, a perfect control over the assembly\r\nof the populus, which could only accept or reject what the senate\r\nbrought before it. When a king died, the royal dignity, until a\r\nsuccessor was elected, was transferred to the Decem Primi, each of\r\nwhom in rotation held this dignity for five days. Under the republic,\r\nthe senate had at first the right of proposing to the comitia the\r\ncandidates for magistracies, but this right was subsequently lost:\r\nthe comitia centuriata became quite free in regard to elections, and\r\nwere no longer dependent upon the proposal of the senate. The curies\r\nonly still possessed the right of sanctioning the election; but in\r\nthe year B.C. 299 they were compelled to sanction any election of\r\nmagistrates which the comitia might make, before it took place, and\r\nthis soon after became law by the Lex Maenia. When at last the curies\r\nno longer assembled for this empty show of power, the senate stepped\r\ninto their place, and henceforth in elections, and soon after also\r\nin matters of legislation, the senate had previously to sanction\r\nwhatever the comitia might decide. After the Lex Hortensia a decree\r\nof the comitia tributa became law, even without the sanction of\r\nthe senate. The original state of things had thus gradually become\r\nreversed, and the senate had lost very important branches of its\r\npower, which had all been gained by the comitia tributa. In its\r\nrelation to the comitia centuriata, however, the ancient rules were\r\nstill in force, as laws, declarations of war, conclusions of peace,\r\ntreaties, &c., were brought before them, and decided by them on the\r\nproposal of the senate.--The powers of the senate, after both orders\r\nwere placed upon a perfect equality, may be thus briefly summed up.\r\nThe senate continued to have the supreme superintendence in all\r\nmatters of religion; it determined upon the manner in which a war was\r\nto be conducted, what legions were to be placed at the disposal of a\r\ncommander, and whether new ones were to be levied; it decreed into\r\nwhat provinces the consuls and praetors were to be sent [PROVINCIA],\r\nand whose imperium was to be prolonged. The commissioners who were\r\ngenerally sent out to settle the administration of a newly-conquered\r\ncountry, were always appointed by the senate. All embassies for the\r\nconclusion of peace or treaties with foreign states were sent out by\r\nthe senate, and such ambassadors were generally senators themselves,\r\nand ten in number. The senate alone carried on the negotiations with\r\nforeign ambassadors, and received the complaints of subject or allied\r\nnations, who always regarded the senate as their common protector.\r\nBy virtue of this office of protector it also settled all disputes\r\nwhich might arise among the municipia and colonies of Italy, and\r\npunished all heavy crimes committed in Italy, which might endanger\r\nthe public peace and security. Even in Rome itself, the judices to\r\nwhom the praetor referred important cases, both public and private,\r\nwere taken from among the senators, and in extraordinary cases the\r\nsenate appointed especial commissions to investigate them; but\r\nsuch a commission, if the case in question was a capital offence\r\ncommitted by a citizen, required the sanction of the people. When\r\nthe republic was in danger, the senate might confer unlimited power\r\nupon the magistrates by the formula, _Videant consules, ne quid\r\nrespublica detrimenti capiat_, which was equivalent to a declaration\r\nof martial law within the city. This general care for the internal\r\nand external welfare of the republic included, as before, the right\r\nof disposing of the finances requisite for these purposes. Hence all\r\nthe revenue and expenditure of the republic were under the direct\r\nadministration of the senate, and the censors and quaestors were\r\nonly its ministers or agents. [CENSOR; QUAESTOR.] All the expenses\r\nnecessary for the maintenance of the armies required the sanction\r\nof the senate, before anything could be done, and it might even\r\nprevent the triumph of a returning general, by refusing to assign the\r\nmoney necessary for it. There are, however, instances of a general\r\ntriumphing without the consent of the senate.--How many members were\r\nrequired to be present in order to constitute a legal assembly, is\r\nuncertain, though it appears that there existed some regulations on\r\nthis point, and there is one instance on record, in which at least\r\none hundred senators were required to be present. The presiding\r\nmagistrate opened the business with the words _Quod bonum, faustum,\r\nfelix fortunatumque sit populo Romano Quiritibus_, and then laid\r\nbefore the assembly (_referre_, _relatio_) what he had to propose.\r\nTowards the end of the republic the order in which the question was\r\nput to the senators appears to have depended upon the discretion of\r\nthe presiding consul, who called upon each member by pronouncing his\r\nname; but he usually began with the princeps senatus, or if consules\r\ndesignati were present, with them. The consul generally observed\r\nall the year round the same order in which he had commenced on the\r\nfirst of January. A senator when called upon to speak might do so\r\nat full length, and even introduce subjects not directly connected\r\nwith the point at issue. It depended upon the president which of the\r\nopinions expressed he would put to the vote, and which he would pass\r\nover. The majority of votes always decided a question. The majority\r\nwas ascertained either by _numeratio_ or _discessio_; that is, the\r\npresident either counted the votes, or the members who voted on the\r\nsame side separated from those who voted otherwise. The latter mode\r\nseems to have been the usual one. What the senate determined was\r\ncalled _senatus consultum_, because the consul, who introduced the\r\nbusiness, was said _senatum consulere_. In the enacting part of a\r\nlex the populus were said _jubere_, and in a plebiscitum _scire_;\r\nin a senatusconsultum the senate was said _censere_. Certain forms\r\nwere observed in drawing up a senatusconsultum, of which there is an\r\nexample in Cicero: “S. C. Auctoritates Pridie Kal. Octob. in Aede\r\nApollinis, scribendo adfuerunt L. Domitius Cn. Filius Ahenobarbus,\r\n&c. Quod M. Marcellus Consul V. F. (_verba fecit_) de prov. Cons. D.\r\nE. R. I. C. (_de ea re ita censuerunt Uti, &c._)” The names of the\r\npersons who were witnesses to the drawing up of the senatusconsultum\r\nwere called the _auctoritates_, and these auctoritates were cited\r\nas evidence of the fact of the persons named in them having been\r\npresent at the drawing up of the S.C. There can be no doubt that\r\ncertain persons were required to be present _scribendo_, but others\r\nmight assist if they chose, and a person in this way might testify\r\nhis regard for another on behalf of whom or with reference to whom\r\nthe S. C. was made. Besides the phrase _scribendo adesse_, there are\r\n_esse ad scribendum_ and _poni ad scribendum_. When a S. C. was made\r\non the motion of a person, it was said to be made _in sententiam\r\nejus_. If the S. C. was carried, it was written on tablets, and\r\nplaced in the Aerarium. Senatusconsulta were, properly speaking,\r\nlaws, for it is clear that the senate had legislative power even\r\nin the republican period; but it is difficult to determine how far\r\ntheir legislative power extended. A _decretum_ of the senate was a\r\nrule made by the senate as to some matter which was strictly within\r\nits competence, and thus differed from a _senatusconsultum_, which\r\nwas a law; but these words are often used indiscriminately and with\r\nlittle precision. Many of the senatusconsulta of the republican\r\nperiod were only determinations of the senate, which became leges\r\nby being carried in the comitia. One instance of this kind occurred\r\non the occasion of the trial of Clodius for violating the mysteries\r\nof the Bona Dea. A rogatio on the subject of the trial was proposed\r\nto the comitia ex senatusconsulto, which is also spoken of as the\r\n_auctoritas_ of the senate. A senate was not allowed to be held\r\nbefore sunrise or to be prolonged after sunset: on extraordinary\r\nemergencies, however, this regulation was set aside.--During the\r\nlatter part of the republic the senate was degraded in various ways\r\nby Sulla, Caesar, and others, and on many occasions it was only an\r\ninstrument in the hands of the men in power. In this way it became\r\nprepared for the despotic government of the emperors, when it was\r\naltogether the creature and obedient instrument of the princeps. The\r\nemperor himself was generally also princeps senatus, and had the\r\npower of convoking both ordinary and extraordinary meetings, although\r\nthe consuls, praetors and tribunes continued to have the same right.\r\nThe ordinary meetings, according to a regulation of Augustus, were\r\nheld twice in every month. In the reign of Tiberius the election of\r\nmagistrates was transferred from the people to the senate, which,\r\nhowever, was enjoined to take especial notice of those candidates who\r\nwere recommended to it by the emperor. At the demise of an emperor\r\nthe senate had the right of appointing his successor, in case no one\r\nhad been nominated by the emperor himself; but the senate very rarely\r\nhad an opportunity of exercising this right, as it was usurped by the\r\nsoldiers. The aerarium at first still continued nominally to be under\r\nthe control of the senate, but the emperors gradually took it under\r\ntheir own exclusive management, and the senate retained nothing but\r\nthe administration of the funds of the city (_arca publica_), which\r\nwere distinct both from the aerarium and from the fiscus. Augustus\r\nordained that no accusations should any longer be brought before the\r\ncomitia, and instead of them he raised the senate to a high court\r\nof justice, upon which he conferred the right of taking cognisance\r\nof capital offences committed by senators, of crimes against the\r\nstate and the person of the emperors, and of crimes committed by the\r\nprovincial magistrates in the administration of their provinces.\r\nRespecting the provinces of the senate, see PROVINCIA. Under the\r\nempire, senatusconsulta began to take the place of leges, properly so\r\ncalled, and as the senate was, with the exception of the emperor, the\r\nonly legislating body, such senatusconsulta are frequently designated\r\nby the name of the consuls in whose year of office they were\r\npassed.--The distinctions and privileges enjoyed by senators were:\r\n1. The tunica with a broad purple stripe (_latus clavus_) in front,\r\nwhich was woven in it, and not, as is commonly believed, sewed upon\r\nit. 2. A kind of short boot, with the letter C. on the front of the\r\nfoot. This C. is generally supposed to mean _centum_, and to refer\r\nto the original number of 100 (_centum_) senators. 3. The right of\r\nsitting in the orchestra in the theatres and amphitheatres. This\r\ndistinction was first procured for the senators by Scipio Africanus\r\nMajor, 194 B.C. 4. On a certain day in the year a sacrifice was\r\noffered to Jupiter in the Capitol, and on this occasion the senators\r\nalone had a feast in the Capitol; the right was called the _jus\r\npublice epulandi_. 5. The _jus liberae legationis_. [LEGATUS, p. 224.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĔNĬŌRES. [COMITIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMVĬRI ĔPŬLŌNES. [EPULONES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTĬMONTĬUM, a Roman festival which was held in the month of\r\nDecember. It was celebrated by the montani, or the inhabitants of the\r\nseven ancient hills or rather districts of Rome, who offered on this\r\nday sacrifices to the gods in their respective districts. These sacra\r\nwere, like the Paganalia, not sacra publica, but privata. They were\r\nbelieved to have been instituted to commemorate the enclosure of the\r\nseven hills of Rome within the walls of the city, and must certainly\r\nbe referred to a time when the Capitoline, Quirinal, and Viminal were\r\nnot yet incorporated with Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTUM. [COMITIA, p. 107.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTUNX. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĔPULCRUM. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĔRA. [JANUA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĒRĬCUM (σηρικόν), silk, also called _bombycinum_. Raw silk was\r\nbrought from the interior of Asia, and manufactured in Cos, as early\r\nas the fourth century B.C. From this island it appears that the Roman\r\nladies obtained their most splendid garments [COA VESTIS], which\r\nwere remarkably thin, sometimes of a fine purple dye, and variegated\r\nwith transverse stripes of gold. Silk was supposed to come from\r\nthe country of the Seres in Asia, whence a silk garment is usually\r\ncalled _Serica vestis_. Under the empire the rage for such garments\r\nwas constantly on the increase. Even men aspired to be adorned with\r\nsilk, and hence the senate, early in the reign of Tiberius, enacted\r\n_ne vestis Serica viros fœdaret_. The eggs of the silkworm were first\r\nbrought into Europe in the age of Justinian, A.D. 530, in the hollow\r\nstem of a plant from “Serinda,” which was probably Khotan in Little\r\nBucharia, by some monks who had learnt the method of hatching and\r\nrearing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERTA. [CORONA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVUS (δοῦλος), a slave. (1) GREEK. Slavery existed almost\r\nthroughout the whole of Greece; and Aristotle says that a complete\r\nhousehold is that which consists of slaves and freemen, and he\r\ndefines a slave to be a living working-tool and possession. None of\r\nthe Greek philosophers ever seem to have objected to slavery as a\r\nthing morally wrong; Plato in his perfect state only desires that\r\nno Greeks should be made slaves by Greeks, and Aristotle defends\r\nthe justice of the institution on the ground of a diversity of\r\nrace, and divides mankind into the free and those who are slaves by\r\nnature; under the latter description he appears to have regarded\r\nall barbarians in the Greek sense of the word, and therefore\r\nconsiders their slavery justifiable. In the most ancient times\r\nthere are said to have been no slaves in Greece, but we find them\r\nin the Homeric poems, though by no means so generally as in later\r\ntimes. They are usually prisoners taken in war, who serve their\r\nconquerors: but we also read as well of the purchase and sale of\r\nslaves. They were, however, at that time mostly confined to the\r\nhouses of the wealthy. There were two kinds of slavery among the\r\nGreeks. One species arose when the inhabitants of a country were\r\nsubdued by an invading tribe, and reduced to the condition of serfs\r\nor bondsmen. They lived upon and cultivated the land which their\r\nmasters had appropriated to themselves, and paid them a certain\r\nrent. They also attended their masters in war. They could not be\r\nsold out of the country or separated from their families, and could\r\nacquire property. Such were the Helots of Sparta [HELOTES], and\r\nthe Penestae of Thessaly [PENESTAE]. The other species of slavery\r\nconsisted of domestic slaves acquired by purchase, who were entirely\r\nthe property of their masters, and could be disposed of like any\r\nother goods and chattels: these were the δοῦλοι properly so called,\r\nand were the kind of slaves that existed at Athens and Corinth. In\r\ncommercial cities slaves were very numerous, as they performed the\r\nwork of the artisans and manufacturers of modern towns. In poorer\r\nrepublics, which had little or no capital, and which subsisted\r\nwholly by agriculture, they would be few: thus in Phocis and Locris\r\nthere are said to have been originally no domestic slaves. The\r\nmajority of slaves was purchased; few comparatively were born in the\r\nfamily of the master, partly because the number of female slaves\r\nwas very small in comparison with the male, and partly because the\r\ncohabitation of slaves was discouraged, as it was considered cheaper\r\nto purchase than to rear slaves. It was a recognised rule of Greek\r\nnational law that the persons of those who were taken prisoners in\r\nwar became the property of the conqueror, but it was the practice\r\nfor Greeks to give liberty to those of their own nation on payment\r\nof a ransom. Consequently almost all slaves in Greece, with the\r\nexception of the serfs above-mentioned, were barbarians. The chief\r\nsupply seems to have come from the Greek colonies in Asia Minor,\r\nwhich had abundant opportunities of obtaining them from their own\r\nneighbourhood and the interior of Asia. A considerable number of\r\nslaves also came from Thrace, where the parents frequently sold\r\ntheir children.--At Athens, as well as in other states, there was a\r\nregular slave-market, called the κύκλος, because the slaves stood\r\nround in a circle. They were also sometimes sold by auction, and were\r\nthen placed on a stone, as is now done when slaves are sold in the\r\nUnited States of North America: the same was also the practice in\r\nRome, whence the phrase _homo de lapide emtus_. [AUCTIO.] At Athens\r\nthe number of slaves was far greater than the free population. Even\r\nthe poorest citizen had a slave for the care of his household, and\r\nin every moderate establishment many were employed for all possible\r\noccupations, as bakers, cooks, tailors, &c.--Slaves either worked on\r\ntheir masters’ account or their own (in the latter case they paid\r\ntheir masters a certain sum a day); or they were let out by their\r\nmaster on hire, either for the mines or any other kind of labour,\r\nor as hired servants for wages. The rowers on board the ships were\r\nusually slaves, who either belonged to the state or to private\r\npersons, who let them out to the state on payment of a certain sum.\r\nIt appears that a considerable number of persons kept large gangs\r\nof slaves merely for the purpose of letting out, and found this\r\na profitable mode of investing their capital. Great numbers were\r\nrequired for the mines, and in most cases the mine-lessees would\r\nbe obliged to hire some, as they would not have sufficient capital\r\nto purchase as many as they wanted. The rights of possession with\r\nregard to slaves differed in no respect from any other property;\r\nthey could be given or taken as pledges. The condition, however, of\r\nGreek slaves was upon the whole better than that of Roman ones, with\r\nthe exception perhaps of Sparta, where, according to Plutarch, it is\r\nthe best place in the world to be a freeman, and the worst to be a\r\nslave. At Athens especially the slaves seem to have been allowed a\r\ndegree of liberty and indulgence which was never granted to them at\r\nRome. The life and person of a slave at Athens were also protected\r\nby the law: a person who struck or maltreated a slave was liable\r\nto an action; a slave too could not be put to death without legal\r\nsentence. He could even take shelter from the cruelty of his master\r\nin the temple of Theseus, and there claim the privilege of being\r\nsold by him. The person of a slave was, of course, not considered\r\nso sacred as that of a freeman: his offences were punished with\r\ncorporal chastisement, which was the last mode of punishment\r\ninflicted on a freeman; he was not believed upon his oath, but\r\nhis evidence in courts of justice was always taken with torture.\r\nNotwithstanding the generally mild treatment of slaves in Greece,\r\ntheir insurrection was not unfrequent: but these insurrections in\r\nAttica were usually confined to the mining slaves, who were treated\r\nwith more severity than the others. Slaves were sometimes manumitted\r\nat Athens, though not so frequently as at Rome. Those who were\r\nmanumitted (ἀπελεύθεροι) did not become citizens, as they might at\r\nRome, but passed into the condition of _metoici_. They were obliged\r\nto honour their former master as their patron (προστάτης), and to\r\nfulfil certain duties towards him, the neglect of which rendered them\r\nliable to the δίκη ἀποστασίου, by which they might again be sold\r\ninto slavery. Respecting the public slaves at Athens, see DEMOSII.\r\nIt appears that there was a tax upon slaves at Athens, which was\r\nprobably three oboli a year for each slave.--(2) ROMAN. The Romans\r\nviewed liberty as the natural state, and slavery as a condition which\r\nwas contrary to the natural state. The mutual relation of slave and\r\nmaster among the Romans was expressed by the terms _Servus_ and\r\n_Dominus_; and the power and interest which the dominus had over and\r\nin the slave was expressed by _Dominium_. Slaves existed at Rome\r\nin the earliest times of which we have any record; but they do not\r\nappear to have been numerous under the kings and in the earliest\r\nages of the republic. The different trades and the mechanical arts\r\nwere chiefly carried on by the clients of the patricians, and the\r\nsmall farms in the country were cultivated for the most part by\r\nthe labours of the proprietor and of his own family. But as the\r\nterritories of the Roman state were extended, the patricians obtained\r\npossession of large estates out of the ager publicus, since it was\r\nthe practice of the Romans to deprive a conquered people of part\r\nof their land. These estates probably required a larger number of\r\nhands for their cultivation than could readily be obtained among the\r\nfree population, and since the freemen were constantly liable to be\r\ncalled away from their work to serve in the armies, the lands began\r\nto be cultivated almost entirely by slave labour. Through war and\r\ncommerce slaves could easily be obtained, and at a cheap rate, and\r\ntheir number soon became so great, that the poorer class of freemen\r\nwas thrown almost entirely out of employment. This state of things\r\nwas one of the chief arguments used by Licinius and the Gracchi for\r\nlimiting the quantity of public land which a person might possess.\r\nIn Sicily, which supplied Rome with so great a quantity of corn,\r\nthe number of agricultural slaves was immense: the oppressions to\r\nwhich they were exposed drove them twice to open rebellion, and\r\ntheir numbers enabled them to defy for a time the Roman power. The\r\nfirst of these servile wars began in B.C. 134 and ended in B.C. 132,\r\nand the second commenced in B.C. 102 and lasted almost four years.\r\nLong, however, after it had become the custom to employ large gangs\r\nof slaves in the cultivation of the land, the number of those who\r\nserved as personal attendants still continued to be small. Persons\r\nin good circumstances seem usually to have had one only to wait upon\r\nthem, who was generally called by the name of his master with the\r\nword _por_ (that is, _puer_) affixed to it, as _Caipor_, _Lucipor_,\r\n_Marcipor_, _Publipor_, _Quintipor_, &c. But during the latter times\r\nof the republic and under the empire the number of domestic slaves\r\ngreatly increased, and in every family of importance there were\r\nseparate slaves to attend to all the necessities of domestic life. It\r\nwas considered a reproach to a man not to keep a considerable number\r\nof slaves. The first question asked respecting a person’s fortune\r\nwas _Quot pascit servos_, “How many slaves does he keep?” Ten slaves\r\nseem to have been the lowest number which a person could keep in the\r\nage of Augustus, with a proper regard to respectability in society.\r\nThe immense number of prisoners taken in the constant wars of the\r\nrepublic, and the increase of wealth and luxury, augmented the number\r\nof slaves to a prodigious extent. A freedman under Augustus, who had\r\nlost much property in the civil wars, left at his death as many as\r\n4,116. Two hundred was no uncommon number for one person to keep. The\r\nmechanical arts, which were formerly in the hands of the clients,\r\nwere now entirely exercised by slaves: a natural growth of things,\r\nfor where slaves perform certain duties or practise certain arts,\r\nsuch duties or arts are thought degrading to a freeman. It must not\r\nbe forgotten, that the games of the amphitheatre required an immense\r\nnumber of slaves trained for the purpose. [GLADIATORES.] Like the\r\nslaves in Sicily, the gladiators in Italy rose in B.C. 73 against\r\ntheir oppressors, and under the able generalship of Spartacus,\r\ndefeated a Roman consular army, and were not subdued till B.C. 71,\r\nwhen 60,000 of them are said to have fallen in battle.--A slave\r\ncould not contract a marriage. His cohabitation with a woman was\r\n_contubernium_; and no legal relation between him and his children\r\nwas recognized. A slave could have no property. He was not incapable\r\nof acquiring property, but his acquisitions belonged to his master.\r\nSlaves were not only employed in the usual domestic offices and in\r\nthe labours of the field, but also as factors or agents for their\r\nmasters in the management of business, and as mechanics, artisans,\r\nand in every branch of industry. It may easily be conceived that,\r\nunder these circumstances, especially as they were often entrusted\r\nwith property to a large amount, there must have arisen a practice\r\nof allowing the slave to consider part of his gains as his own; this\r\nwas his _Peculium_, a term also applicable to such acquisitions of\r\na filius-familias as his father allowed him to consider as his own.\r\n[PATRIA POTESTAS.] According to strict law, the _peculium_ was the\r\nproperty of the master, but according to usage, it was considered\r\nto be the property of the slave. Sometimes it was agreed between\r\nmaster and slave, that the slave should purchase his freedom with\r\nhis _peculium_ when it amounted to a certain sum. A runaway slave\r\n(_fugitivus_) could not lawfully be received or harboured. The master\r\nwas entitled to pursue him wherever he pleased; and it was the duty\r\nof all authorities to give him aid in recovering the slave. It was\r\nthe object of various laws to check the running away of slaves in\r\nevery way, and accordingly a runaway slave could not legally be an\r\nobject of sale. A class of persons called _Fugitivarii_ made it their\r\nbusiness to recover runaway slaves. A person was a slave either\r\njure gentium or jure civili. Under the republic, the chief supply\r\nof slaves arose from prisoners taken in war, who were sold by the\r\nquaestors with a crown on their heads (_sub corona venire, vendere_),\r\nand usually on the spot where they were taken, as the care of a large\r\nnumber of captives was inconvenient. Consequently slave-dealers\r\nusually accompanied an army, and frequently after a great battle had\r\nbeen gained many thousands were sold at once, when the slave-dealers\r\nobtained them for a mere nothing. The slave trade was also carried\r\non to a great extent, and after the fall of Corinth and Carthage,\r\nDelos was the chief mart for this traffic. When the Cilician pirates\r\nhad possession of the Mediterranean, as many as 10,000 slaves are\r\nsaid to have been imported and sold there in one day. A large number\r\ncame from Thrace and the countries in the north of Europe, but the\r\nchief supply was from Africa, and more especially Asia, whence we\r\nfrequently read of Phrygians, Lycians, Cappadocians, &c. as slaves.\r\nThe trade of slave-dealers (_mangones_) was considered disreputable;\r\nbut it was very lucrative, and great fortunes were frequently\r\nrealised from it. Slaves were usually sold by auction at Rome. They\r\nwere placed either on a raised stone (hence _de lapide emtus_), or a\r\nraised platform (_catasta_), so that every one might see and handle\r\nthem, even if they did not wish to purchase them. Purchasers usually\r\ntook care to have them stripped naked, for slave-dealers had recourse\r\nto as many tricks to conceal personal defects as the horse-jockeys of\r\nmodern times: sometimes purchasers called in the advice of medical\r\nmen. Newly imported slaves had their feet whitened with chalk, and\r\nthose that came from the East had their ears bored, which we know was\r\na sign of slavery among many eastern nations. The slave-market, like\r\nall other markets, was under the jurisdiction of the aediles, who\r\nmade many regulations by edicts respecting the sale of slaves. The\r\ncharacter of the slave was set forth in a scroll (_titulus_) hanging\r\naround his neck, which was a warranty to the purchaser: the vendor\r\nwas bound to announce fairly all his defects, and if he gave a false\r\naccount had to take him back within six months from the time of his\r\nsale, or make up to the purchaser what the latter had lost through\r\nobtaining an inferior kind of slave to what had been warranted. The\r\nchief points which the vendor had to warrant, were the health of\r\nthe slave, especially freedom from epilepsy, and that he had not a\r\ntendency to thievery, running away, or committing suicide. Slaves\r\nsold without any warranty wore at the time of sale a cap (_pileus_)\r\nupon their head. Slaves newly imported were generally preferred\r\nfor common work: those who had served long were considered artful\r\n(_veteratores_); and the pertness and impudence of those born in\r\ntheir master’s house, called _vernae_, were proverbial. The value\r\nof slaves depended of course upon their qualifications; but under\r\nthe empire the increase of luxury and the corruption of morals led\r\npurchasers to pay immense sums for beautiful slaves, or such as\r\nministered to the caprice or whim of the purchaser. Eunuchs always\r\nfetched a very high price, and Martial speaks of beautiful boys who\r\nsold for as much as 100,000 or 200,000 sesterces each (885_l._ 8_s._\r\n4_d._ and 1770_l._ 16_s._ 8_d._). Slaves who possessed a knowledge\r\nof any art which might bring profit to their owners, also sold for a\r\nlarge sum. Thus literary men and doctors frequently fetched a high\r\nprice, and also slaves fitted for the stage.--Slaves were divided\r\ninto many various classes: the first division was into public or\r\nprivate. The former belonged to the state and public bodies, and\r\ntheir condition was preferable to that of the common slaves. They\r\nwere less liable to be sold, and under less control, than ordinary\r\nslaves: they also possessed the privilege of the testamenti factio\r\nto the amount of one half of their property, which shows that they\r\nwere regarded in a different light from other slaves. Public slaves\r\nwere employed to take care of the public buildings, and to attend\r\nupon magistrates and priests. A body of slaves belonging to one\r\nperson was called _familia_, but two were not considered sufficient\r\nto constitute a _familia_. Private slaves were divided into urban\r\n(_familia urbana_) and rustic (_familia rustica_); but the name of\r\nurban was given to those slaves who served in the villa or country\r\nresidence as well as in the town house; so that the words urban and\r\nrustic rather characterised the nature of their occupations than\r\nthe place where they served. Slaves were also arranged in certain\r\nclasses, which held a higher or a lower rank according to the nature\r\nof their occupation. These classes are _ordinarii_, _vulgares_,\r\nand _mediastini_.--_Ordinarii_ seem to have been those slaves who\r\nhad the superintendence of certain parts of the housekeeping. They\r\nwere always chosen from those who had the confidence of their\r\nmaster, and they generally had certain slaves under them. To this\r\nclass the _actores_, _procuratores_, and _dispensatores_ belong,\r\nwho occur in the familia rustica as well as the familia urbana,\r\nbut in the former are almost the same as the _villici_. They were\r\nstewards or bailiffs. To the same class also belong the slaves who\r\nhad the charge of the different stores, and who correspond to our\r\nhouse-keepers and butlers: they are called _cellarii_, _promi_,\r\n_condi_, _procuratores peni_, &c.--_Vulgares_ included the great\r\nbody of slaves in a house who had to attend to any particular duty\r\nin the house, and to minister to the domestic wants of their master.\r\nAs there were distinct slaves or a distinct slave for almost every\r\ndepartment of household economy, as bakers (_pistores_), cooks\r\n(_coqui_), confectioners (_dulciarii_), picklers (_salmentarii_),\r\n&c., it is unnecessary to mention these more particularly. This\r\nclass also included the porters (_ostiarii_), the bed-chamber slaves\r\n(_cubicularii_), the litter-bearers (_lecticarii_), and all personal\r\nattendants of any kind.--_Mediastini_, the name given to slaves\r\nused for any common purpose, was chiefly applied to certain slaves\r\nbelonging to the familia rustica.--The treatment of slaves of course\r\nvaried greatly, according to the disposition of their masters, but\r\nthey were upon the whole, as has been already remarked, treated with\r\ngreater severity and cruelty than among the Athenians. Originally the\r\nmaster could use the slave as he pleased; under the republic the law\r\ndoes not seem to have protected the person or life of the slave at\r\nall; but the cruelty of masters was to some extent restrained under\r\nthe empire by various enactments. In early times, when the number of\r\nslaves was small, they were treated with more indulgence, and more\r\nlike members of the family: they joined their masters in offering up\r\nprayers and thanksgivings to the gods, and partook of their meals in\r\ncommon with their masters, though not at the same table with them,\r\nbut upon benches (_subsellia_) placed at the foot of the lectus.\r\nBut with the increase of numbers and of luxury among masters, the\r\nancient simplicity of manners was changed: a certain quantity of\r\nfood was allowed them (_dimensum_ or _demensum_), which was granted\r\nto them either monthly (_menstruum_) or daily (_diarium_). Their\r\nchief food was the corn called _far_, of which either four or five\r\nmodii were granted them a month, or one Roman pound (_libra_) a\r\nday. They also obtained an allowance of salt and oil: Cato allowed\r\nhis slaves a sextarius of oil a month and a modius of salt a year.\r\nThey also got a small quantity of wine, with an additional allowance\r\non the Saturnalia and Compitalia, and sometimes fruit, but seldom\r\nvegetables. Butcher’s meat seems to have been hardly ever given\r\nthem. Under the republic they were not allowed to serve in the army,\r\nthough after the battle of Cannae, when the state was in imminent\r\ndanger, 8000 slaves were purchased by the state for the army, and\r\nsubsequently manumitted on account of their bravery. The offences\r\nof slaves were punished with severity, and frequently with the\r\nutmost barbarity. One of the mildest punishments was the removal\r\nfrom the familia urbana to the rustica, where they were obliged to\r\nwork in chains or fetters. They were frequently beaten with sticks\r\nor scourged with the whip. Runaway slaves (_fugitivi_) and thieves\r\n(_fures_) were branded on the forehead with a mark (_stigma_),\r\nwhence they are said to be _notati_ or _inscripti_. Slaves were also\r\npunished by being hung up by their hands with weights suspended to\r\ntheir feet, or by being sent to work in the Ergastulum or Pistrinum.\r\n[ERGASTULUM.] The carrying of the furca was a very common mode of\r\npunishment. [FURCA.] The toilet of the Roman ladies was a dreadful\r\nordeal to the female slaves, who were often barbarously punished by\r\ntheir mistresses for the slightest mistake in the arrangement of\r\nthe hair or a part of the dress. Masters might work their slaves\r\nas many hours in the day as they pleased, but they usually allowed\r\nthem holidays on the public festivals. At the festival of Saturnus,\r\nin particular, special indulgences were granted to all slaves, of\r\nwhich an account is given under SATURNALIA. There was no distinctive\r\ndress for slaves. It was once proposed in the senate to give slaves\r\na distinctive costume, but it was rejected, since it was considered\r\ndangerous to show them their number. Male slaves were not allowed\r\nto wear the toga or bulla, nor females the stola, but otherwise\r\nthey were dressed nearly in the same way as poor people, in clothes\r\nof a dark colour (_pullati_) and slippers (_crepidae_). The rights\r\nof burial, however, were not denied to slaves, for, as the Romans\r\nregarded slavery as an institution of society, death was considered\r\nto put an end to the distinction between slaves and freemen. Slaves\r\nwere sometimes even buried with their masters, and we find funeral\r\ninscriptions addressed to the Dii Manes of slaves (_Dis Manibus_).\r\n\r\n\r\nSESCUNX. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSESTERTĬUS, a Roman coin, which properly belonged to the silver\r\ncoinage, in which it was one-fourth of the denarius, and therefore\r\nequal to 2½ asses. Hence the name, which is an abbreviation of\r\n_semis tertius_ (sc. _nummus_), the Roman mode of expressing 2½.\r\nThe word _nummus_ is often expressed with _sestertius_, and often\r\nit stands alone, meaning _sestertius_. Hence the symbol HS or IIS,\r\nwhich is used to designate the sestertius. It stands either for LLS\r\n(_Libra Libra et Semis_), or for IIS, the two I’s merely forming\r\nthe numeral two (sc. _asses_ or _librae_), and the whole being in\r\neither case equivalent to _dupondius et semis_. When the as was\r\nreduced to half an ounce, and the number of asses in the denarius\r\nwas made sixteen instead of ten [AS, DENARIUS], the sestertius was\r\nstill ¼ of the denarius, and therefore contained no longer 2½, but\r\n4 asses. The old reckoning of 10 asses to the denarius was kept,\r\nhowever, in paying the troops. After this change the sestertius was\r\ncoined in brass as well as in silver; the metal used for it was that\r\ncalled _aurichalcum_, which was much finer than the common _aes_, of\r\nwhich the asses were made. The sum of 1000 _sestertii_ was called\r\n_sestertium_. This was also denoted by the symbol HS, the obvious\r\nexplanation of which is “IIS (2½ millia).” The _sestertium_ was\r\nalways a sum of money, never a _coin_; the _coin_ used in the payment\r\nof large sums was the denarius. According to the value we have\r\nassigned to the DENARIUS, up to the time of Augustus, we have--\r\n\r\n                             _£.   s.   d.  farth._\r\n            the sestertius =  0    0    2     ·5\r\n            the sestertium =  8   17    1\r\n  After the reign of Augustus--\r\n            the sestertius =  0    0    1    3·5\r\n            the sestertium =  7   16    3\r\n\r\nThe sestertius was the denomination of money almost always used in\r\nreckoning considerable amounts. There are a very few examples of the\r\nuse of the denarius for this purpose. The mode of reckoning was as\r\nfollows:--_Sestertius_ = _sestertius nummus_ = _nummus_. Sums below\r\n1000 _sestertii_ were expressed by the numeral adjectives joined with\r\neither of these forms. The sum of 1000 sestertii = _mille sestertii_\r\n= M _sestertium_ (for _sestertiorum_) = M _nummi_ = M _nummum_\r\n(for _nummorum_) = M _sestertii nummi_ = M _sestertium nummum_ =\r\n_sestertium_. These forms are used with the numeral adjectives below\r\n1000: sometimes _millia_ is used instead of _sestertia_: sometimes\r\nboth words are omitted: sometimes _nummum_ or _sestertium_ is added.\r\nFor example, 600,000 sestertii = _sescenta sestertia_ = _sescenta\r\nmillia_ = _sescenta_ = _sescenta sestertia nummum_. For sums of a\r\nthousand _sestertia_ (_i.e._ a million _sestertii_) and upwards,\r\nthe numeral adverbs in _ies_ (_decies, undecies, vicies, &c._) are\r\nused, with which the words _centena millia_ (a hundred thousand) must\r\nbe understood. With these adverbs the neuter singular _sestertium_\r\nis joined in the case required by the construction. Thus, _decies\r\nsestertium_ = _decies centena millia sestertium_ = _ten times a\r\nhundred thousand sestertii_ = 1,000,000 sestertii = 1000 _sestertia_:\r\n_millies_ HS = _millies centena millia sestertium_ = a thousand times\r\none hundred thousand sestertii = 100,000,000 _sestertii_ = 100,000\r\n_sestertia_. When the numbers are written in cypher, it is often\r\ndifficult to know whether _sestertii_ or _sestertia_ are meant. A\r\ndistinction is sometimes made by a line placed over the numeral when\r\n_sestertia_ are intended, or in other words, when the numeral is an\r\nadverb in _ies_. Thus\r\n\r\n  HS. M.C.   = 1100 sestertii, but\r\n  HS. M̄.C̄. = HS millies centies\r\n             = 110,000 sestertia\r\n             = 110,000,000 sestertii.\r\n\r\n_Sesterce_ is sometimes used as an English word. If so, it ought\r\nto be used only as the translation of _sestertius_, never of\r\n_sestertium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĒVIR. [EQUITES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSEX SUFFRĀGĬA. [EQUITES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXTANS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXTĀRĬUS, a Roman dry and liquid measure. It was one-sixth of the\r\ncongius, and hence its name. It was divided, in the same manner as\r\nthe As, into parts named _uncia, sextans, quadrans, triens, quincunx,\r\nsemissis, &c._ The uncia, or twelfth part of the sextarius, was the\r\nCYATHUS; its _sextans_ was therefore two cyathi, its _quadrans_\r\nthree, its _triens_ four, its _quincunx_ five, &c. (See Tables.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSĬBYLLĪNI LIBRI. These books are said to have been obtained in the\r\nreign of Tarquinius Priscus, or according to other accounts in\r\nthat of Tarquinius Superbus, when a Sibyl (Σίβυλλα), or prophetic\r\nwoman, presented herself before the king, and offered nine books\r\nfor sale. Upon the king refusing to purchase them, she went and\r\nburnt three, and then returned and demanded the same price for the\r\nremaining six as she had done for the nine. The king again refused\r\nto purchase them, whereupon she burnt three more, and demanded the\r\nsame sum for the remaining three as she had done at first for the\r\nnine; the king’s curiosity now became excited, so that he purchased\r\nthe books, and then the Sibyl vanished. These books were probably\r\nwritten in Greek, as the later ones undoubtedly were. They were kept\r\nin a stone chest under ground in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,\r\nunder the custody of certain officers, at first only two in number,\r\nbut afterwards increased successively to ten and fifteen, of whom\r\nan account is given under DECEMVIRI. The public were not allowed to\r\ninspect the books, and they were only consulted by the officers, who\r\nhad the charge of them, at the special command of the senate. They\r\nwere not consulted, as the Greek oracles were, for the purpose of\r\ngetting light concerning future events; but to learn what worship\r\nwas required by the gods, when they had manifested their wrath by\r\nnational calamities or prodigies. Accordingly we find that the\r\ninstruction they give is in the same spirit; prescribing what honour\r\nwas to be paid to the deities already recognised, or what new\r\nones were to be imported from abroad. When the temple of Jupiter\r\nCapitolinus was burnt in B.C. 82, the Sibylline books perished in the\r\nfire; and in order to restore them, ambassadors were sent to various\r\ntowns in Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor, to make fresh collections,\r\nwhich on the rebuilding of the temple were deposited in the same\r\nplace that the former had occupied. The Sibylline books were also\r\ncalled _Fata Sibyllina_ and _Libri Fatales_. Along with the Sibylline\r\nbooks were preserved, under the guard of the same officers, the books\r\nof the two prophetic brothers, the Marcii, the Etruscan prophecies of\r\nthe nymph Bygoe, and those of Albuna or Albunea of Tibur. Those of\r\nthe Marcii, which had not been placed there at the time of the battle\r\nof Cannae, were written in Latin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĪCA, _dim._ SĪCĪLA, whence the English _sickle_, a curved dagger,\r\nadapted by its form to be concealed under the clothes, and therefore\r\ncarried by robbers and murderers. _Sica_ may be translated _a\r\nscimitar_, to distinguish it from PUGIO, which denoted a dagger of\r\nthe common kind. _Sicarius_, though properly meaning one who murdered\r\nwith the sica, was applied to murderers in general. Hence the forms\r\n_de sicariis_ and _inter sicarios_ were used in the criminal courts\r\nin reference to murder. Thus _judicium inter sicarios_, “a trial for\r\nmurder;” _defendere inter sicarios_, “to defend against a charge of\r\nmurder.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSĬGILLĀRĬA. [SATURNALIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNA MĪLĬTĀRĬA (σημεῖα, σημαίαι), military ensigns or standards.\r\nThe most ancient standard employed by the Romans is said to have\r\nbeen a handful of straw fixed to the top of a spear or pole. Hence\r\nthe company of soldiers belonging to it was called _Manipulus_. The\r\nbundle of hay or fern was soon succeeded by the figures of animals,\r\nviz. the eagle, the wolf, the minotaur, the horse, and the boar.\r\nThese appear to have corresponded to the five divisions of the Roman\r\narmy as shown on p. 165. The eagle (_aquila_) was carried by the\r\n_aquilifer_ in the midst of the _hastati_, and we may suppose the\r\nwolf to have been carried among the _principes_, and so on. In the\r\nsecond consulship of Marius, B.C. 104, the four quadrupeds were\r\nentirely laid aside as standards, the eagle being alone retained.\r\nIt was made of silver, or bronze, and with expanded wings, but was\r\nprobably of a small size, since a standard-bearer (_signifer_) under\r\nJulius Caesar is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the\r\neagle from its staff, and concealed it in the folds of his girdle.\r\nUnder the later emperors the eagle was carried, as it had been for\r\nmany centuries, with the legion, a legion being on that account\r\nsometimes called _aquila_, and at the same time each cohort had\r\nfor its own ensign the serpent or dragon (_draco_, δράκων), which\r\nwas woven on a square piece of cloth, elevated on a gilt staff,\r\nto which a cross-bar was adapted for the purpose, and carried by\r\nthe _draconarius_. Another figure used in the standards was a ball\r\n(_pila_), supposed to have been emblematic of the dominion of Rome\r\nover the world; and for the same reason a bronze figure of Victory\r\nwas sometimes fixed at the top of the staff. Under the eagle or other\r\nemblem was often placed a head of the reigning emperor, which was to\r\nthe army the object of idolatrous adoration. The minor divisions of a\r\ncohort, called _centuries_, had also each an ensign, inscribed with\r\nthe number both of the cohort and of the century. By this provision\r\nevery soldier was enabled with the greatest ease to take his place.\r\nThe standard of the cavalry, properly called _vexillum_, was a\r\nsquare piece of cloth expanded upon a cross in the manner already\r\nindicated, and perhaps surmounted by some figure. The following cut,\r\ncontaining several standards, represents the performance of the\r\nsacrifice called _suovetaurilia_. The imperial standard from the time\r\nof Constantine was called _labarum_; on it a figure or emblem of\r\nChrist was woven in gold upon purple cloth, and this was substituted\r\nfor the head of the emperor. Since the movements of a body of troops\r\nand of every portion of it were regulated by the standards, all the\r\nevolutions, acts, and incidents of the Roman army were expressed by\r\nphrases derived from this circumstance. Thus _signa inferre_ meant\r\nto advance, _referre_ to retreat, and _convertere_ to face about;\r\n_efferre_, or _castris vellere_, to march out of the camp; _ad signa\r\nconvenire_, to re-assemble. Notwithstanding some obscurity in the\r\nuse of terms, it appears that, whilst the standard of the legion was\r\nproperly called _aquila_, those of the cohorts were in a special\r\nsense of the term called _signa_, their bearers being _signiferi_,\r\nand that those of the manipuli or smaller divisions of the cohort\r\nwere denominated _vexilla_, their bearers being _vexillarii_. In time\r\nof peace the standards were kept in the AERARIUM, under the care of\r\nthe QUAESTOR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Military Standards. (Bellori, Vet. Arc. Aug.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĬLĬCERNĬUM. [FUNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPŬLUM or SIMPŬVĬUM, the name of a small cup used in sacrifices, by\r\nwhich libations of wine were offered to the gods. It is represented\r\non the coin figured under SECESPITA. There was a proverbial\r\nexpression _excitare fluctus in simpulo_, “to make much ado about\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSĪPĂRĬUM, a piece of tapestry stretched on a frame, which rose before\r\nthe stage of the theatre, and consequently answered the purpose of\r\nthe drop-scene with us, although, contrary to our practice, it was\r\ndepressed when the play began, so as to go below the level of the\r\nstage (_aulaea premuntur_), and was raised again when the performance\r\nwas concluded (_tolluntur_). It appears that human figures were\r\nrepresented upon it, whose feet seemed to rest upon the stage when\r\nthis screen was drawn up. These figures were sometimes those of\r\nBritons woven in the canvass, and raising their arms in the attitude\r\nof lifting up a purple curtain, so as to be introduced in the same\r\nmanner as Atlantes, Persae, and Caryatides. [CARYATIDES.] In a more\r\ngeneral sense, _siparium_ denoted any piece of cloth or canvass\r\nstretched upon a frame.\r\n\r\n\r\nSISTRUM (σεῖστρον), a mystical instrument of music, used by the\r\nancient Egyptians in their ceremonies, and especially in the worship\r\nof Isis. It was held in the right hand (see cut), and shaken, from\r\nwhich circumstance it derived its name. The introduction of the\r\nworship of Isis into Italy shortly before the commencement of the\r\nChristian aera made the Romans familiar with this instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sistra. (The two figures on the left hand from\r\npaintings found at Portici; the right-hand figure represents a\r\nSistrum formerly belonging to the library of St. Genovefa at Paris.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĬTELLA. [SITULA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSĪTŎPHỸLĂCES (σιτοφύλακες), a board of officers, chosen by lot, at\r\nAthens. They were at first three, afterwards increased to fifteen, of\r\nwhom ten were for the city, five for the Peiraeus. Their business was\r\npartly to watch the arrival of the corn ships, take account of the\r\nquantity imported, and see that the import laws were duly observed;\r\npartly to watch the sales of corn in the market, and take care that\r\nthe prices were fair and reasonable, and none but legal weights and\r\nmeasures used by the factors; in which respect their duties were much\r\nthe same as those of the Agoranomi and Metronomi with regard to other\r\nsaleable articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĪTOS (σῖτος), corn. The soil of Attica, though favourable to the\r\nproduction of figs, olives, and grapes, was not so favourable for\r\ncorn; and accordingly a large quantity of corn was annually imported.\r\nExportation was entirely prohibited, nor was any Athenian or resident\r\nalien allowed to carry corn to any other place than Athens. Whoever\r\ndid so, was punishable with death. Of the corn brought into the\r\nAthenian port two-thirds was to be brought into the city and sold\r\nthere. No one might lend money on a ship that did not sail with\r\nan express condition to bring a return cargo, part of it corn, to\r\nAthens. Strict regulations were made with respect to the sale of\r\ncorn in the market. Conspiracies among the corn-dealers (σιτοπῶλαι)\r\nto buy up the corn (συνωνεῖσθαι), or raise the price (συνιστάναι τὰς\r\nτιμὰς), were punished with death. The sale of corn was placed under\r\nthe supervision of a special board of officers called _Sitophylaces_\r\n(σιτοφύλακες), while that of all other marketable commodities\r\nwas superintended by the agoranomi. It was their business to see\r\nthat meal and bread were of the proper quality, and sold at the\r\nlegal weight and price. Notwithstanding these careful provisions,\r\nscarcities (σιτοδεῖαι) frequently occurred at Athens. The state then\r\nmade great efforts to supply the wants of the people by importing\r\nlarge quantities of corn, and selling it at a low price. Public\r\ngranaries were kept in the Odeum, Pompeum, Long Porch, and naval\r\nstorehouse near the sea. _Sitonae_ (σιτῶναι) were appointed to\r\nget in the supply and manage the sale. Persons called _apodectae_\r\n(ἀποδέκται) received the corn, measured it out, and distributed it in\r\ncertain quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĪTOU DĬCĒ (σίτου δίκη). If anything happened to sever a marriage\r\ncontract, the husband or his representative was bound to repay the\r\nmarriage portion (προῖξ); or, if he failed to do so, he was liable\r\nto pay interest upon it at the rate of eighteen per cent. per annum.\r\nA woman’s fortune was usually secured by a mortgage of the husband’s\r\nproperty; but whether this was so or not, her guardian might bring an\r\naction against the party who unjustly withheld it; δίκη προικὸς, to\r\nrecover the principal, δίκη σίτου, for the interest. The interest was\r\ncalled σῖτος (alimony or maintenance), because it was the income out\r\nof which the woman had to be maintained. The word σῖτος is often used\r\ngenerally for provisions, just as we use the word _bread_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSĬTŬLA, _dim._ SĬTELLA (ὑδρία), was probably a bucket or pail\r\nfor drawing and carrying water, but was more usually applied to\r\nthe vessel from which lots were drawn. The diminutive _sitella_,\r\nhowever, was more commonly used in this signification. It appears\r\nthat the vessel was filled with water (as among the Greeks, whence\r\nthe word ὑδρία), and that the lots (_sortes_) were made of wood;\r\nand as, though increasing in size below, it had a narrow neck, only\r\none lot could come to the top of the water at the same time, when\r\nit was shaken. The vessel used for drawing lots was also called\r\n_urna_ or _orca_ as well as _Situla_ or _Sitella_. It is important\r\nto understand the difference in meaning, between Sitella and Cista,\r\nin their use in the comitia and courts of justice, since they have\r\nbeen frequently confounded. The _Sitella_ was the urn, from which\r\nthe names of the tribes or centuries were drawn out by lot, so that\r\neach might have its proper place in voting, and the _Cista_ was the\r\nballot-box into which the tabellae were cast in voting. The Cista\r\nseems to have been made of wicker or similar work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cista. Sitella.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCCUS, _dim._ SOCCŬLUS, was nearly if not altogether equivalent in\r\nmeaning to CREPIDA, and denoted a slipper or low shoe, which did not\r\nfit closely, and was not fastened by any tie. The Soccus was worn by\r\ncomic actors, and was in this respect opposed to the COTHURNUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Socci, slippers, worn by a Mimus or Buffoon. (From an\r\nancient Painting.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSŎCĬI (σύμμαχοι). In the early times, when Rome formed equal\r\nalliances with any of the surrounding nations, these nations were\r\ncalled _Socii_. After the dissolution of the Latin league, when the\r\nname _Latini_, or _Nomen Latinum_, was artificially applied to a\r\ngreat number of Italians, only a few of whom were real inhabitants\r\nof the old Latin towns, and the majority of whom had been made\r\nLatins by the will and the law of Rome, there necessarily arose a\r\ndifference between these Latins and the Socii, and the expression\r\n_Socii Nomen Latinum_ is one of the old asyndeta, instead of _Socii\r\net Nomen Latinum_. The Italian allies again must be distinguished\r\nfrom foreign allies. The Italian allies consisted, for the most part,\r\nof such nations as had either been conquered by the Romans, or had\r\ncome under their dominion through other circumstances. When such\r\nnations formed an alliance with Rome, they generally retained their\r\nown laws; or if they were not allowed this privilege at first, they\r\nusually obtained it subsequently. The condition of the Italian allies\r\nvaried, and mainly depended upon the manner in which they had come\r\nunder the Roman dominion; but in reality they were always dependent\r\nupon Rome. The following are the principal duties which the Italian\r\nSocii had to perform towards Rome: they had to send subsidies in\r\ntroops, money, corn, ships, and other things, whenever Rome demanded\r\nthem. The number of troops requisite for completing or increasing the\r\nRoman armies was decreed every year by the senate, and the consuls\r\nfixed the amount which each allied nation had to send; in proportion\r\nto its population capable of bearing arms, of which each nation was\r\nobliged to draw up accurate lists, called _formulae_. The consul\r\nalso appointed the place and time at which the troops of the socii,\r\neach part under its own leader, had to meet him and his legions.\r\nThe infantry of the allies in a consular army was usually equal in\r\nnumbers to that of the Romans; the cavalry was generally three times\r\nthe number of the Romans: but these numerical proportions were not\r\nalways observed. The consuls appointed twelve praefects as commanders\r\nof the socii, and their power answered to that of the twelve military\r\ntribunes in the consular legions. These praefects, who were probably\r\ntaken from the allies themselves, and not from the Romans, selected\r\na third of the cavalry, and a fifth of the infantry of the socii,\r\nwho formed a select detachment for extraordinary cases, and who were\r\ncalled the _extraordinarii_. The remaining body of the socii was\r\nthen divided into two parts, called the right and the left wing. The\r\ninfantry of the wings was, as usual, divided into cohorts, and the\r\ncavalry into turmae. In some cases also legions were formed of the\r\nsocii. Pay and clothing were given to the allied troops by the states\r\nor towns to which they belonged, and which appointed quaestors or\r\npaymasters for this purpose: but Rome furnished them with provisions\r\nat the expense of the republic: the infantry received the same as\r\nthe Roman infantry, but the cavalry only received two-thirds of what\r\nwas given to the Roman cavalry. In the distribution of the spoil and\r\nof conquered lands they frequently received the same share as the\r\nRomans. They were never allowed to take up arms of their own accord,\r\nand disputes among them were settled by the senate. Notwithstanding\r\nall this, the socii fell gradually under the arbitrary rule of the\r\nsenate and the magistrates of Rome; and after the year B.C. 173, it\r\neven became customary for magistrates, when they travelled through\r\nItaly, to demand of the authorities of allied towns to pay homage\r\nto them, to provide them with a residence, and to furnish them\r\nwith beasts of burden when they continued their journey. The only\r\nway for the allies to obtain any protection against such arbitrary\r\nproceedings, was to enter into a kind of clientela with some\r\ninfluential and powerful Roman. Socii who revolted against Rome were\r\nfrequently punished with the loss of their freedom, or of the honour\r\nof serving in the Roman armies. Such punishments however varied\r\naccording to circumstances. After the civitas had been granted to all\r\nthe Italians by the Lex Julia de Civitate (B.C. 90), the relation of\r\nthe Italian socii to Rome ceased. But Rome had long before this event\r\napplied the name Socii to foreign nations also which were allied\r\nwith Rome, though the meaning of the word in this case differed\r\nfrom that of the Socii Italici. There were two principal kinds of\r\nalliances with foreign nations: 1. _foedus aequum_, such as might\r\nbe concluded either after a war in which neither party had gained a\r\ndecisive victory, or with a nation with which Rome had never been at\r\nwar; 2. a _foedus iniquum_, when a foreign nation conquered by the\r\nRomans was obliged to form the alliance on any terms proposed by the\r\nconquerors. In the latter case the foreign nation was to some extent\r\nsubject to Rome, and obliged to comply with anything that Rome might\r\ndemand. But all foreign socii, whether they had an equal or unequal\r\nalliance, were obliged to send subsidies in troops when Rome demanded\r\nthem; these troops, however, did not, like those of the Italian\r\nsocii, serve in the line, but were employed as light-armed soldiers,\r\nand were called _milites auxiliares_, _auxiliarii_, _auxilia_, or\r\nsometimes _auxilia externa_. Towards the end of the republic all the\r\nRoman allies, whether they were nations or kings, sank down to the\r\ncondition of mere subjects or vassals of Rome, whose freedom and\r\nindependence consisted in nothing but a name.

It was a frequent practice among the Italian nations\r\nto endeavour to ascertain a knowledge of future events by drawing\r\nlots (_sortes_): in many of the ancient Italian temples the will\r\nof the gods was consulted in this way, as at Praeneste, Caere, &c.\r\nThese sortes or lots were usually little tablets or counters, made\r\nof wood or other materials, and were commonly thrown into a sitella\r\nor urn, filled with water, as is explained under SITULA. The lots\r\nwere sometimes thrown like dice. The name of sortes was in fact given\r\nto anything used to determine chances, and was also applied to any\r\nverbal response of an oracle. Various things were written upon the\r\nlots according to circumstances, as for instance the names of the\r\npersons using them, &c.: it seems to have been a favourite practice\r\nin later times to write the verses of illustrious poets upon little\r\ntablets, and to draw them out of the urn like other lots, the verses\r\nwhich a person thus obtained being supposed to be applicable to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPĔCŬLĀRĬA. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPĔCŬLĀTŌRES, or EXPLŌRĀTŌRES, were scouts or spies sent before\r\nan army, to reconnoitre the ground and observe the movements of\r\nthe enemy. Under the emperors there was a body of troops called\r\nSpeculatores, who formed part of the praetorian cohorts, and had the\r\nespecial care of the emperor’s person.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPĔCŬLUM (κάτοπτρον, ἔσοπτρον, ἔνοπτρον), a mirror, a looking-glass.\r\nThe looking-glasses of the ancients were usually made of metal,\r\nat first of a composition of tin and copper, but afterwards more\r\nfrequently of silver. The ancients seem to have had glass mirrors\r\nalso like ours, consisting of a glass plate covered at the back with\r\na thin leaf of metal. They were manufactured as early as the time of\r\nPliny at the celebrated glass-houses of Sidon, but they must have\r\nbeen inferior to those of metal, since they never came into general\r\nuse, and are never mentioned by ancient writers among costly pieces\r\nof furniture, whereas metal mirrors frequently are. Looking-glasses\r\nwere generally small, and such as could be carried in the hand.\r\nInstead of their being fixed so as to be hung against the wall or to\r\nstand upon the table or floor, they were generally held by female\r\nslaves before their mistresses when dressing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking-glass held by a Nymph.

[HASTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPĪRA (σπεῖρα), _dim._ SPĪRŬLA, the base of a column. This member did\r\nnot exist in the Doric order of Greek architecture, but was always\r\npresent in the Ionic and Corinthian, and, besides the bases properly\r\nbelonging to those orders, there was one called the Attic, which may\r\nbe regarded as a variety of the Ionic [ATTICURGES]. In the Ionic\r\nand Attic the base commonly consisted of two tori (_torus superior_\r\nand _torus inferior_) divided by a _scotia_ (τρόχιλος), and in the\r\nCorinthian of two tori divided by two scotiae. The upper torus was\r\noften fluted (ῥαβδωτός), and surmounted by an astragal [ASTRAGALUS],\r\nas in the left-hand figure of the annexed woodcut, which shows the\r\nform of the base in the Ionic temple of Panops on the Ilissus. The\r\nright-hand figure in the same woodcut shows the corresponding part\r\nin the temple of Minerva Polias at Athens. In this the upper torus\r\nis wrought with a plaited ornament, perhaps designed to represent a\r\nrope or cable. In these two temples the spira rests not upon a plinth\r\n(_plinthus_, πλίνθος), but on a podium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spirae (bases) of Columns. (From ancient Columns.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPŎLĬA. Four words are commonly employed to denote booty taken in\r\nwar, _Praeda, anubiae_, _Exuviae_, _Spolia_. Of these _Praeda_ bears\r\nthe most comprehensive meaning, being used for plunder of every\r\ndescription. _Manubiae_ would seem strictly to signify that portion\r\nof the spoil which fell to the share of the commander-in-chief,\r\nthe proceeds of which were frequently applied to the erection of\r\nsome public building. _Exuviae_ indicates anything stripped from\r\nthe person of a foe, while _Spolia_, properly speaking, ought to\r\nbe confined to armour and weapons, although both words are applied\r\nloosely to trophies, such as chariots, standards, beaks of ships\r\nand the like, which might be preserved and displayed. Spoils\r\ncollected on the battlefield after an engagement, or found in a\r\ncaptured town, were employed to decorate the temples of the gods,\r\ntriumphal arches, porticoes, and other places of public resort, and\r\nsometimes in the hour of extreme need served to arm the people; but\r\nthose which were gained by individual prowess were considered the\r\nundoubted property of the successful combatant, and were exhibited\r\nin the most conspicuous part of his dwelling, being hung up in the\r\natrium, suspended from the door-posts, or arranged in the vestibulum,\r\nwith appropriate inscriptions. They were regarded as peculiarly\r\nsacred, so that even if the house was sold the new possessor was not\r\npermitted to remove them. But while on the one hand it was unlawful\r\nto remove spoils, so it was forbidden to _replace_ or _repair_ them\r\nwhen they had fallen down or become decayed through age; the object\r\nof this regulation being doubtless to guard against the frauds of\r\nfalse pretenders. Of all spoils the most important were the _spolia\r\nopima_, a term applied to those only which the commander-in-chief of\r\na Roman army stripped in a field of battle from the leader of the\r\nfoe. Plutarch expressly asserts that Roman history up to his own time\r\nafforded but three examples of the _spolia opima_. The first were\r\nsaid to have been won by Romulus from Acro, king of the Caeninenses,\r\nthe second by Aulus Cornelius Cossus from Lar Tolumnius, king of the\r\nVeientes, the third by M. Claudius Marcellus from Viridomarus, king\r\nof the Gaesatae. In all these cases, in accordance with the original\r\ninstitution, the spoils were dedicated to Jupiter Feretrius.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPONSA, SPONSUS, SPONSĀLĬA. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORTŬLA. In the days of Roman freedom, clients were in the habit\r\nof testifying respect for their patron by thronging his atrium at\r\nan early hour, and escorting him to places of public resort when he\r\nwent abroad. As an acknowledgment of these courtesies, some of the\r\nnumber were usually invited to partake of the evening meal. After\r\nthe extinction of liberty, the presence of such guests, who had\r\nnow lost all political importance, was soon regarded as an irksome\r\nrestraint, while at the same time many of the noble and wealthy\r\nwere unwilling to sacrifice the pompous display of a numerous body\r\nof retainers. Hence the practice was introduced under the empire of\r\nbestowing on each client, when he presented himself for his morning\r\nvisit, a certain portion of food as a substitute and compensation\r\nfor the occasional invitation to a regular supper (_coena recta_),\r\nand this dole, being carried off in a little basket provided for the\r\npurpose, received the name of _sportula_. For the sake of convenience\r\nit soon became common to give an equivalent in money, the sum\r\nestablished by general usage being a hundred quadrantes. The donation\r\nin money, however, did not entirely supersede the sportula given in\r\nkind, for we find in Juvenal a lively description of a great man’s\r\nvestibule crowded with dependents, each attended by a slave bearing\r\na portable kitchen to receive the viands and keep them hot while\r\nthey were carried home. Under the empire great numbers of the lower\r\norders derived their whole sustenance, and the funds for ordinary\r\nexpenditure, exclusively from this source, while even the highborn\r\ndid not scruple to increase their incomes by taking advantage of the\r\nostentatious profusion of the rich and vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTĂDĬUM (ὁ στάδιος and τὸ στάδιον), a Greek measure of length, and\r\nthe chief one used for itinerary distances. It was equal to 600\r\nGreek or 625 Roman feet, or to 125 Roman paces; and the Roman mile\r\ncontained 8 stadia. Hence the stadium contained 606 feet 9 inches\r\nEnglish. This standard prevailed throughout Greece, under the name\r\nof the Olympic stadium, so called because it was the exact length\r\nof the stadium or foot-race course at Olympia, measured between the\r\npillars at the two extremities of the course. The first use of the\r\nmeasure seems to be contemporaneous with the formation of the stadium\r\nat Olympia when the Olympic games were revived by Iphitus (B.C. 884\r\nor 828). This distance doubled formed the δίαυλος, the ἱππικον was 4\r\nstadia, and the δόλιχος is differently stated at 6, 7, 8, 12, 20, and\r\n24 stadia. A day’s journey by land was reckoned at 200 or 180 stadia,\r\nor for an army 150 stadia. The stadium at Olympia was used not only\r\nfor the foot-race, but also for the other contests which were added\r\nto the games from time to time [OLYMPIA], except the horse-races,\r\nfor which a place was set apart, of a similar form with the stadium,\r\nbut larger; this was called the Hippodrome (ἱππόδρομος). The name\r\nstadium was also given to all other places throughout Greece wherever\r\ngames were celebrated. The stadium was an oblong area terminated at\r\none end by a straight line, at the other by a semicircle having the\r\nbreadth of the stadium for its base. Round this area were ranges of\r\nseats rising above one another in steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTĀTĒR (στατῆρ), which means simply _a standard_ (in this case\r\nboth of weight and more particularly of money), was the name of\r\nthe principal gold coin of Greece, which was also called _Chrysus_\r\n(χρυσοῦς). The stater is said to have been first coined in Lydia by\r\nCroesus, and probably did not differ materially from the stater which\r\nwas afterwards current in Greece, and which was equal _in weight_ to\r\n_two_ drachmae, and _in value_ to _twenty_. The Macedonian stater,\r\nwhich was the one most in use after the time of Philip and his son\r\nAlexander the Great, was of the value of about 1_l._ 3_s._ 6_d._ In\r\ncalculating the value of the stater in our money the ratio of gold to\r\nsilver must not be overlooked. Thus the stater of Alexander, which we\r\nhave valued, according to the present worth of gold, at 1_l._ 3_s._\r\n6_d._, passed for twenty drachmae, which, according to the present\r\nvalue of silver, were worth only 16_s._ 3_d._ But the former is the\r\ntrue worth of the stater, the difference arising from the greater\r\nvalue of silver in ancient times than now.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTĂTĬŌNES. [CASTRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTĂTOR, a public servant, who attended on the Roman magistrates in\r\nthe provinces. The Statores seem to have derived their name from\r\nstanding by the side of the magistrate, and thus being at hand to\r\nexecute all his commands; they appear to have been chiefly employed\r\nin carrying letters and messages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTĀTŬĀRĬA ARS is in its proper sense the art of making statues or\r\nbusts, whether they consist of stone or metal or other materials, and\r\nincludes the art of making the various kinds of reliefs (alto, basso,\r\nand mezzo relievo). These arts in their infant state existed among\r\nthe Greeks from time immemorial. There is no material applicable to\r\nstatuary which was not used by the Greeks. As _soft clay_ is capable\r\nof being shaped without difficulty into any form, and is easily\r\ndried, either by being exposed to the sun or by being baked, we may\r\nconsider this substance to have been the earliest material of which\r\nfigures were made. The name plastic art (ἡ πλαστική), by which the\r\nancients sometimes designate the art of statuary, properly signifies\r\nto form or shape a thing of clay. The second material was _wood_,\r\nand figures made of wood were called ξόανα, from ξέω, “polish” or\r\n“carve.” It was chiefly used for making images of the gods, and\r\nprobably more on account of the facility of working in it, than for\r\nany other reason. _Stone_ was little used in statuary during the\r\nearly ages of Greece, though it was not altogether unknown, as we\r\nmay infer from the relief on the Lion-gate of Mycenae. In Italy,\r\nwhere the soft peperino afforded an easy material for working, stone\r\nappears to have been used at an earlier period and more commonly\r\nthan in Greece. But in the historical times the Greeks used all the\r\nprincipal varieties of marble for their statues. Different kinds of\r\nmarble and of different colours were sometimes used in one and the\r\nsame statue, in which case the work is called Polylithic statuary.\r\n_Bronze_ (χάλκος, _aes_), _silver_, and _gold_ were used profusely in\r\nthe state of society described in the Homeric poems. At that period,\r\nhowever, and long after, the works executed in metal were made by\r\nmeans of the hammer, and the different pieces were joined together by\r\npins, rivets, cramps, or other mechanical fastenings, and, as the art\r\nadvanced, by a kind of glue, cement, or solder. Iron came into use\r\nmuch later, and the art of casting both bronze and iron is ascribed\r\nto Rhoecus and to Theodoras of Samos. _Ivory_ was employed at a later\r\nperiod than any of the before-mentioned materials, and then was\r\nhighly valued both for its beauty and rarity. In its application to\r\nstatuary, ivory was generally combined with gold, and was used for\r\nthe parts representing the flesh. The history of ancient art, and of\r\nstatuary in particular, may be divided into five periods.\r\n\r\nI. _First Period, from the earliest times till about 580_ B.C.--Three\r\nkinds of artists may be distinguished in the mythical period. The\r\nfirst consists of gods and daemons; such as Athena, Hephaestus, the\r\nPhrygian or Dardanian Dactyli, and the Cabiri. The second contains\r\nwhole tribes of men distinguished from others by the mysterious\r\npossession of superior skill in the practice of the arts, such as\r\nthe Telchines and the Cyclopes. The third consists of individuals\r\nwho are indeed described as human beings, but yet are nothing\r\nmore than personifications of particular branches of art, or the\r\nrepresentatives of families of artists. Of the latter the most\r\ncelebrated is _Daedalus_, whose name indicates nothing but a smith,\r\nor an artist in general, and who is himself the mythical ancestor\r\nof a numerous family of artists (_Daedalids_), which can be traced\r\nfrom the time of Homer to that of Plato, for even Socrates is said\r\nto have been a descendant of this family. _Smilis_ (from σμίλη, a\r\ncarving-knife) exercised his art in Samos, Aegina, and other places,\r\nand some remarkable works were attributed to him. _Endoeus_ of\r\nAthens is called a disciple of Daedalus. According to the popular\r\ntraditions of Greece, there was no period in which the gods were not\r\nrepresented in some form or other, and there is no doubt that for\r\na long time there existed no other statues in Greece than those of\r\nthe gods. The earliest representations of the gods, however, were\r\nonly symbolic. The presence of a god was indicated by the simplest\r\nand most shapeless symbols, such as unhewn blocks of stone (λίθοι\r\nἀργοί), and by simple pillars or pieces of wood. The general name\r\nfor a representation of a god not consisting of such a rude symbol\r\nwas ἄγαλμα. In the Homeric poems there are sufficient traces of the\r\nexistence of statues of the gods; but they probably did not display\r\nany artistic beauty. The only work of art which has come down to us\r\nfrom the heroic age is the relief above the ancient gate of Mycenae,\r\nrepresenting two lions standing on their hind legs, with a sort of\r\npillar between them (woodcut under MURUS). The time which elapsed\r\nbetween the composition of the Homeric poems and the beginning of the\r\nfifth century before our aera may be termed the age of discovery;\r\nfor nearly all the inventions, upon the application of which the\r\ndevelopment of the arts is dependent, are assigned to this period.\r\nGlaucus of Chios or Samos is said to have invented the art of\r\nsoldering metal (σιδήρου κόλλησις). The two artists most celebrated\r\nfor their discoveries were the two brothers Telecles and Theodoras of\r\nSamos, about the time of Polycrates. They invented the art of casting\r\nfigures of metal. During the whole of this period, though marble and\r\nbronze began to be extensively applied, yet wood was more generally\r\nused for representations of the gods. These statues were painted\r\n[PICTURA], and in most cases dressed in the most gorgeous attire.\r\nThe style in which they are executed is called the _archaic_ or the\r\n_hieratic_ style. The figures are stiff and clumsy, the countenances\r\nhave little or no individuality, the eyes long and small, and the\r\nouter angles turned a little upwards; the mouth, which is likewise\r\ndrawn upwards at the two corners, has a smiling appearance. The hair\r\nis carefully worked, but looks stiff and wiry, and hangs generally\r\ndown in straight lines, which are curled at the ends. The arms hang\r\ndown the sides of the body, unless the figure carries something in\r\nits hands. The drapery is likewise stiff, and the folds are very\r\nsymmetrical and worked with little regard to nature.\r\n\r\nII. _Second Period, from 580 to 480_ B.C.--The number of artists who\r\nflourished during this period is truly astonishing. The Ionians of\r\nAsia Minor and the islanders of the Aegean, who had previously been\r\nin advance of the other Greeks in the exercise of the fine arts, had\r\ntheir last flourishing period from 560 to 528 B.C. Works in metal\r\nwere produced in high perfection in Samos, in Aegina and Argos, while\r\nChios gained the greatest reputation from its possessing the earliest\r\ngreat school of sculptors in marble, in which Bupalus and Anthermus\r\nwere the most distinguished about 540 B.C. Their works were scattered\r\nover various parts of Greece, and their value may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that Augustus adorned with them the pediment of the temple\r\nof Apollo on the Palatine. Sicyon also possessed a celebrated school\r\nof sculptors in marble, and about 580 B.C. Dipoenus and Scyllis, who\r\nhad come from Crete, were at the head of it, and executed several\r\nmarble statues of gods. Respecting Magna Graecia and Sicily we\r\nknow few particulars, though it appears that the arts here went on\r\nimproving and continued to be in advance of the mother-country. The\r\nmost celebrated artists in southern Italy were Dameas of Croton,\r\nand Pythagoras of Rhegium. In Athens the arts made great progress\r\nunder the patronage of the Pisistratids. The most celebrated among\r\nthe Athenian sculptors of this period were Critias and Hegias, or\r\nHegesias, both distinguished for their works in bronze. The former\r\nof them made in 477 B.C. the statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton.\r\nArgos also distinguished itself, and it is a curious circumstance,\r\nthat the greatest Attic artists with whom the third period opens, and\r\nwho brought the Attic art to its culminating point, are disciples\r\nof the Argive Ageladas (about 516 B.C.) In the statues of the gods\r\n(ἀγάλματα), which were made for temples as objects of worship, the\r\nhieratic style was more or less conscientiously retained, and it is\r\ntherefore not in these statues that we have to seek for proofs of\r\nthe progress of art. But even in temple-statues wood began to give\r\nway to other and better materials. Besides bronze, marble also, and\r\nivory and gold were now applied to statues of the gods, and it was\r\nnot uncommon to form the body of a statue of wood, and to make its\r\nhead, arms, and feet of stone (ἀκρόλιθοι), or to cover the whole of\r\nsuch a wooden figure with ivory and gold. From the statues of the\r\ngods erected for worship we must distinguish those statues which were\r\ndedicated in temples as ἀναθήματα, and which now became customary\r\ninstead of craters, tripods, &c. In these the artists were not only\r\nnot bound to any traditional or conventional forms, but were, like\r\nthe poets, allowed to make free use of mythological subjects, to\r\nadd, and to omit, or to modify the stories, so as to render them\r\nmore adapted for their artistic purposes. A third class of statues,\r\nwhich were erected during this period in great numbers, were those\r\nof the victors in the national games, and, though more rarely,\r\nof other distinguished persons (ἀνδριάντες). Those of the latter\r\nkind appear generally to have been portraits (εἰκόνες, _statuae\r\niconicae_). The first iconic statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton\r\nwere made by Antenor in 509 B.C., and in 477 B.C. new statues of the\r\nsame persons were made by _Critias_. It was also at the period we\r\nare now describing that it became customary to adorn the pediments,\r\nfriezes, and other parts of temples with reliefs or groups of statues\r\nof marble. We still possess two great works of this kind which are\r\nsufficient to show their general character during this period. 1.\r\nThe _Selinuntine Marbles_, or the metopes of two temples on the\r\nacropolis of Selinus in Sicily, which were discovered in 1823, and\r\nare at present in the Museum of Palermo. 2. The _Aeginetan Marbles_,\r\nwhich were discovered in 1812 in the island of Aegina, and are now at\r\nMunich. They consist of eleven statues, which adorned two pediments\r\nof a temple of Athena, and represent the goddess leading the Aeacids\r\nagainst Troy, and contain manifest allusions to the war of the Greeks\r\nwith the Persians.\r\n\r\nIII. _Third Period, from 480 to 336_ B.C.--During this period Athens\r\nwas the centre of the fine arts in Greece. Statuary went hand in\r\nhand with the other arts and with literature: it became emancipated\r\nfrom its ancient fetters, from the stiffness and conventional forms\r\nof former times, and reached its culminating point in the sublime\r\nand mighty works of Phidias. His career begins about 452 B.C. The\r\ngenius of this artist was so great and so generally recognised,\r\nthat all the great works which were executed in the age of Pericles\r\nwere placed under his direction, and thus the whole host of artists\r\nwho were at that time assembled at Athens were engaged in working\r\nout his designs and ideas. Of these we have still some remains:--1.\r\nParts of the eighteen sculptured metopes, together with the frieze\r\nof the small sides of the cella of the temple of Theseus. Ten of the\r\nmetopes represent the exploits of Hercules, and the eight others\r\nthose of Theseus. The figures in the frieze are manifestly gods, but\r\ntheir meaning is uncertain. Casts of these figures are in the British\r\nMuseum. 2. A considerable number of the metopes of the Parthenon,\r\nwhich are all adorned with reliefs in marble, a great part of the\r\nfrieze of the cella, some colossal figures, and a number of fragments\r\nof the two pediments of this temple. The greater part of these works\r\nis now in the British Museum, where they are collected under the name\r\nof the Elgin Marbles. Besides the sculptures of these temples, there\r\nare also similar ornaments of other temples extant, which show the\r\ninfluence which the school of Phidias exercised in various parts of\r\nGreece. Of these the most important are, the Phigalian marbles, which\r\nbelonged to the temple of Apollo Epicurius, built about 436 B.C., by\r\nIctinus. They were discovered in 1812, and consist of twenty-three\r\nplates of marble belonging to the inner frieze of the cella. They\r\nare now in the British Museum. The subjects represented in them\r\nare fights with Centaurs and Amazons, and one plate shows Apollo\r\nand Artemis drawn in a chariot by stags. About the same time that\r\nthe Attic school rose to its highest perfection under Phidias, the\r\nschool of Argos was likewise raised to its summit by Polycletus. The\r\nart of making bronze statues of athletes was carried by him to the\r\ngreatest perfection: ideal youthful and manly beauty was the sphere\r\nin which he excelled. One of his statues, a youthful Doryphorus,\r\nwas made with such accurate observation of the proportions of the\r\nparts of the body, that it was looked upon by the ancient artists\r\nas a canon of rules on this point. Myron of Eleutherae, about 432\r\nB.C., adhered to a closer imitation of nature than Polycletus, and\r\nas far as the impression upon the senses was concerned, his works\r\nwere most pleasing. The cow of Myron in bronze was celebrated in all\r\nantiquity. The change which took place after the Peloponnesian war\r\nin the public mind at Athens could not fail to show its influence\r\nupon the arts also. It was especially Scopas of Paros and Praxiteles\r\nof Athens, about one generation after Myron and Polycletus, who gave\r\nthe reflex of their time in their productions. Their works expressed\r\nthe softer feelings and an excited state of mind, such as would make\r\na strong impression upon and captivate the senses of the beholders.\r\nBoth were distinguished as sculptors in marble, and both worked in\r\nthe same style; the legendary circles to which most of their ideal\r\nproductions belong are those of Dionysus and Aphrodite, a fact which\r\nalso shows the character of the age. Cephissodorus and Timarchus were\r\nsons of Praxiteles. There were several works of the former at Rome\r\nin the time of Pliny; he made his art subservient to passions and\r\nsensual desires. Most of the above-mentioned artists, however widely\r\ntheir works differed from those of the school of Phidias, may yet be\r\nregarded as having only continued and developed its principles of art\r\nin a certain direction; but towards the end of this period Euphranor\r\nand Lysippus of Sicyon carried out the principles of the Argive\r\nschool of Polycletus. Their principal object was to represent the\r\nhighest possible degree of physical beauty and of athletic and heroic\r\npower. The chief characteristic of Lysippus and his school is a close\r\nimitation of nature, which even contrived to represent bodily defects\r\nin some interesting manner, as in his statues of Alexander.\r\n\r\nIV. _Fourth Period, from 336 to 146_ B.C.--During the first fifty\r\nyears of this period the schools of Praxiteles and Lysippus continued\r\nto flourish, especially in works of bronze; but after this time\r\nbronze statues were seldom made, until the art was carried on with\r\nnew vigour at Athens about the end of the period. The school of\r\nLysippus gave rise to that of Rhodes, where his disciple Chares\r\nformed the most celebrated among the hundred colossal statues of\r\nthe sun. It was seventy cubits high, and partly of metal. It stood\r\nnear the harbour, and was thrown down by an earthquake about 225\r\nB.C. Antiquarians assign to this part of the fourth period several\r\nvery beautiful works still extant, as the magnificent group of\r\nLaocoon and his sons, which was discovered in 1506 near the baths of\r\nTitus, and is at present at Rome. This is, next to the Niobe, the\r\nmost beautiful group among the extant works of ancient art; it was\r\naccording to Pliny the work of three Rhodian artists: Agesander,\r\nPolydorus, and Athenodorus. The celebrated Farnesian bull is likewise\r\nthe work of two Rhodian artists, Apollonius and Tauriscus. In the\r\nvarious kingdoms which arose out of the conquests of Alexander\r\nthe arts were more or less cultivated. Not only were the great\r\nmaster-works of former times copied to adorn the new capitals, but\r\nnew schools of artists sprang up in several of them. At Pergamus\r\nthe celebrated groups were composed which represented the victories\r\nof Attalus and Eumenes over the Gauls. It is believed by some that\r\nthe so-called dying gladiator at Rome is a statue of a Gaul, which\r\noriginally belonged to one of these groups. The Borghese gladiator\r\nin the Louvre is supposed to be the work of an Ephesian Agasias,\r\nand to have originally formed a part of such a battle-scene. About\r\nthe close of this period, and for more than a century afterwards,\r\nthe Romans, in the conquest of the countries where the arts had\r\nflourished, made it a regular practice to carry away the works of\r\nart. The triumphs over Philip, Antiochus, the Aetolians, the Gauls in\r\nAsia, Perseus, Pseudo-Philip, and above all the taking of Corinth,\r\nand subsequently the victories over Mithridates and Cleopatra, filled\r\nthe Roman temples and porticoes with the greatest variety of works\r\nof art. The sacrilegious plunder of temples and the carrying away\r\nof the sacred statues from the public sanctuaries became afterwards\r\na common practice. The manner in which Verres acted in Sicily is\r\nbut one of many instances of the extent to which these robberies\r\nwere carried on. The emperors, especially Augustus, Caligula, and\r\nNero, followed these examples, and the immense number of statues\r\nwhich, notwithstanding all this, remained at Rhodes, Delphi, Athens,\r\nand Olympia, is truly astonishing.--We can only briefly advert to\r\nthe history of statuary among the Etruscans and Romans down to the\r\nyear 146 B.C. The Etruscans were on the whole an industrious and\r\nenterprising people. With the works of Grecian art they must have\r\nbecome acquainted at an early time through their intercourse with\r\nthe Greeks of southern Italy, whose influence upon the art of the\r\nEtruscans is evident in numerous cases. The whole range of the fine\r\narts was cultivated by the Etruscans at an early period. Statuary in\r\nclay (which here supplied the place of wood, ξόανα, used in Greece)\r\nand in bronze appears to have acquired a high degree of perfection.\r\nIn 267 B.C. no fewer than 2000 bronze statues are said to have\r\nexisted at Volsinii, and numerous works of Etruscan art are still\r\nextant, which show great vigour and life, though they do not possess\r\na very high degree of beauty. Some of their statues are worked in\r\na Greek style; others are of a character peculiar to themselves,\r\nand entirely different from works of Grecian art, being stiff and\r\nugly: others again are exaggerated and forced in their movements\r\nand attitudes, and resemble the figures which we meet with in the\r\nrepresentations of Asiatic nations. The Romans previously to the\r\ntime of the first Tarquin are said to have had no images of the\r\ngods; and for a long time afterwards their statues of gods in clay\r\nor wood were made by Etruscan artists. During the early part of the\r\nrepublic the works executed at Rome were altogether of a useful and\r\npractical, and not of an ornamental character; and statuary was in\r\nconsequence little cultivated. But in the course of time the senate\r\nand the people, as well as foreign states which desired to show\r\ntheir gratitude to some Roman, began to erect bronze statues to\r\ndistinguished persons in the Forum and other places.\r\n\r\nV. _Fifth Period, from_ B.C. _146 to the fall of the Western\r\nEmpire._--During this period Rome was the capital of nearly the whole\r\nof the ancient world, not through its intellectual superiority, but\r\nby its military and political power. But it nevertheless became the\r\ncentre of art and literature, as the artists resorted thither from\r\nall parts of the empire for the purpose of seeking employment in the\r\nhouses of the great. The mass of the people, however, had as little\r\ntaste for and were as little concerned about the arts as ever. In\r\nthe time of Nero, who did much for the arts, we meet with Zenodorus,\r\na founder of metal statues, who was commissioned by the emperor to\r\nexecute a colossal statue of 110 feet high, representing Nero as\r\nthe Sun. In the reign of Hadrian the arts seem to begin a new aera.\r\nHe himself was undoubtedly a real lover of art, and encouraged it\r\nnot only at Rome, but in Greece and Asia Minor. The great Villa of\r\nHadrian below Tivoli, the ruins of which cover an extent of ten\r\nRoman miles in circumference, was richer in works of art than any\r\nother place in Italy. Here more works of art have been dug out of\r\nthe ground than anywhere else within the same compass. Some statues\r\nexecuted at this time are worthy of the highest admiration. Foremost\r\namong these stand the statues and busts of Antinous, for whom the\r\nemperor entertained a passionate partiality, and who was represented\r\nin innumerable works of art. The colossal bust of Antinous in the\r\nLouvre is reckoned one of the finest works of ancient art, and is\r\nplaced by some critics on an equality with the best works that Greece\r\nhas produced. There are also some very good works in red marble which\r\nare referred to this period, as that material is not known to have\r\nbeen used before the age of Hadrian. As the arts had received such\r\nencouragement and brought forth such fruits in the reign of Hadrian,\r\nthe effects remained visible for some time during the reigns of the\r\nAntonines. The frieze of a temple, which the senate caused to be\r\nerected to Antoninus Pius and Faustina, is adorned with griffins\r\nand vessels of very exquisite workmanship. The best among the\r\nextant works of this time are the equestrian statue of M. Aurelius\r\nof gilt bronze, which stands on the Capitol, and the column of M.\r\nAurelius with reliefs representing scenes of his war against the\r\nMarcomanni. After the time of the Antonines the symptoms of decline\r\nin the arts became more and more visible. The most numerous works\r\ncontinued to be busts and statues of the emperors, but the best\r\namong them are not free from affectation and mannerism. In the time\r\nof Caracalla many statues were made, especially of Alexander the\r\nGreat. Alexander Severus was a great admirer of statues, not from a\r\ngenuine love of art, but because he delighted in the representations\r\nof great and good men. The reliefs on the triumphal arch of Septimius\r\nSeverus, representing his victories over the Parthians, Arabs, and\r\nAdiabenians, have scarcely any artistic merits. Art now declined\r\nwith great rapidity: busts and statues were more seldom made than\r\nbefore, and are awkward and poor; the hair is frequently indicated\r\nby nothing else but holes bored in the stone. The reliefs on the\r\nsarcophagi gradually become monotonous and lifeless. The reliefs on\r\nthe arch of Constantine, which are not taken from that of Trajan, are\r\nperfectly rude and worthless, and those on the column of Theodosius\r\nwere not better. Before concluding, it remains to say a few words on\r\nthe destruction of ancient works of art. During the latter part of\r\nthe reign of Constantine many statues of the gods were destroyed,\r\nand not long after his time a systematic destruction began, which\r\nunder Theodosius spread to all parts of the empire. The spirit of\r\ndestruction, however, was not directed against works of art in\r\ngeneral and as such, but only against the pagan idols. The opinion,\r\ntherefore, which is entertained by some, that the losses we have\r\nsustained in works of ancient art, are mainly attributable to the\r\nintroduction of Christianity, is too sweeping and general. Of the\r\nsame character is another opinion, according to which the final decay\r\nof ancient art was a consequence of the spiritual nature of the new\r\nreligion. The coincidence of the general introduction of Christianity\r\nwith the decay of the arts is merely accidental. That the early\r\nChristians did not despise the arts as such, is clear from several\r\nfacts. We know that they erected statues to their martyrs, of which\r\nwe have a specimen in that of St. Hippolytus in the Vatican library.\r\nThe numerous works, lastly, which have been found in the Christian\r\ncatacombs at Rome, might alone be a sufficient proof that the early\r\nChristians were not hostile towards the representation of the heroes\r\nof their religion in works of art. In fact, Christianity during the\r\nmiddle ages became as much the mother of the arts of modern times, as\r\nthe religion of Greece was the mother of ancient art. Another very\r\ngeneral and yet incorrect notion is, that the northern barbarians\r\nafter the conquest of Rome intentionally destroyed works of art.\r\nThis opinion is not supported by any of the contemporary historians,\r\nnor is it at all probable. The barbarians were only anxious to carry\r\nwith them the most precious treasures in order to enrich themselves;\r\na statue must have been an object of indifference to them. What\r\nperished, perished naturally by the circumstances and calamities of\r\nthe times. In times of need bronze statues were melted down and the\r\nmaterial used for other purposes; marble statues were frequently\r\nbroken to pieces and used for building materials. If we consider\r\nthe history of Rome during the first centuries after the conquest of\r\nItaly by the Germans, we have every reason to wonder that so many\r\nspecimens of ancient art have come down to our times. The greatest\r\ndestruction, at one time, of ancient works of art is supposed to have\r\noccurred at the taking of Constantinople, in the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century. Among the few works saved from this devastation\r\nare the celebrated bronze horses which now decorate the exterior of\r\nSt. Mark’s church at Venice. They have been ascribed, but without\r\nsufficient authority, to Lysippus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTĬLUS or STỸLUS is in all probability the same word with the Greek\r\nστύλος, and conveys the general idea of an object tapering like\r\nan architectural column. It signifies, (1) An iron instrument,\r\nresembling a pencil in size and shape, used for writing upon waxed\r\ntablets. At one end it was sharpened to a point for scratching\r\nthe characters upon the wax, while the other end, being flat and\r\ncircular, served to render the surface of the tablets smooth again,\r\nand so to obliterate what had been written. Thus, _vertere stilum_\r\nmeans _to erase_, and hence _to correct_. The stylus was also termed\r\n_graphium_, and the case in which it was kept _graphiarium_.--(2) A\r\nsharp stake or spike placed in pitfalls before an entrenchment, to\r\nembarrass the progress of an attacking enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stilus. (Museo Borbonico, vol. vi. tav. 35.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIPENDĬĀRĬI. The stipendiariae urbes of the Roman provinces\r\nwere so denominated, as being subject to the payment of a fixed\r\nmoney-tribute, _stipendium_, in contradistinction to the vectigales,\r\nwho paid a certain portion as a tenth or twentieth of the produce\r\nof their lands, their cattle, or customs. The word _stipendium_\r\nwas used to signify the tribute paid, as it was originally imposed\r\nfor and afterwards appropriated to the purpose of furnishing the\r\nRoman soldiers with pay. The condition of the urbes stipendiariae\r\nis generally thought to have been more honourable than that of the\r\nvectigales, but the distinction between the two terms was not always\r\nobserved. The word stipendiarius is also applied to a person who\r\nreceives a fixed salary or pay, as a _stipendiarius miles_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTĪPENDĬUM, a pension or pay, from _stipem_ and _pendo_, because\r\nbefore silver was coined at Rome the copper-money in use was paid by\r\nweight and not by tale. According to Livy, the practice of giving\r\npay to the Roman soldiers was not introduced till B.C. 405, on\r\nthe occasion of the taking of Tarracina or Anxur. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that they received pay before this time, but, since it was\r\nnot paid regularly, its first institution was referred to this year.\r\nIn B.C. 403 a certain amount of pay was assigned to the knights\r\nalso, or EQUITES, p. 156, _b_. This, however, had reference to the\r\ncitizens who possessed an equestrian fortune, but had no horse\r\n(_equus publicus_) assigned to them by the state, for it had always\r\nbeen customary for the knights of the 18 centuries to receive pay out\r\nof the common treasury, in the shape of an allowance for the purchase\r\nof a horse, and a yearly pension of 2000 asses for its keep. [AES\r\nEQUESTRE; AES HORDEARIUM.] In the time of the republic the pay of a\r\nlegionary soldier amounted to two oboli, or 3⅓ asses; a centurion\r\nreceived double, and an eques or horseman triple. Polybius states\r\nthat foot soldiers also received in corn every month an allowance\r\n(_demensum_) of ⅔ of an Attic medimnus, or about 2 bushels of wheat:\r\nthe horsemen 7 medimni of barley and 2 of wheat. The infantry of the\r\nallies received the same allowance as the Roman: the horsemen 1⅓\r\nmedimni of wheat and 5 of barley. But there was this difference, that\r\nthe allied forces received their allowances as a gratuity; the Roman\r\nsoldiers, on the contrary, had deducted from their pay the money\r\nvalue of whatever they received in corn, armour, or clothes. There\r\nwas indeed a law passed by C. Gracchus, which provided that besides\r\ntheir pay the soldiers should receive from the treasury an allowance\r\nfor clothes; but this law seems either to have been repealed or to\r\nhave fallen into disuse. The pay was doubled for the legionaries by\r\nJulius Caesar before the civil war. He also gave them corn whenever\r\nhe had the means, without any restrictions. Under Augustus it appears\r\nto have been raised to 10 asses a day (three times the original sum).\r\nIt was still further increased by Domitian. The praetorian cohorts\r\nreceived twice as much as the legionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTŎLA, a female dress worn over the tunic; it came as low as the\r\nankles or feet, and was fastened round the body by a girdle, leaving\r\nabove the breast broad folds. The tunic did not reach much below\r\nthe knee, but the essential distinction between the tunic and stola\r\nseems to have been that the latter always had an _instita_ or flounce\r\nsewed to the bottom and reaching to the instep. Over the stola the\r\npalla or pallium was worn [PALLIUM], as we see in the cut annexed.\r\nThe stola was the characteristic dress of the Roman matrons, as the\r\ntoga was of the Roman men. Hence the meretrices were not allowed to\r\nwear it, but only a dark-coloured toga; and accordingly Horace speaks\r\nof the _matrona_ in contradistinction to the _togata_. For the same\r\nreason, women who had been divorced from their husbands on account of\r\nadultery, were not allowed to wear the stola, but only the toga.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stola, female dress. (Museo Borbonico, vol. iii. tav.\r\n37.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRĂTĒGUS (στρατηγός), general. This office and title seems to\r\nhave been more especially peculiar to the democratic states of\r\nancient Greece: we read of them, for instance, at Athens, Tarentum,\r\nSyracuse, Argos, and Thurii; and when the tyrants of the Ionian\r\ncities in Asia Minor were deposed by Aristagoras, he established\r\nstrategi in their room, to act as chief magistrates. The strategi\r\nat Athens were instituted after the remodelling of the constitution\r\nby Clisthenes, to discharge the duties which had in former times\r\nbeen performed either by the king or the archon polemarchus. They\r\nwere ten in number, one for each of the ten tribes, and chosen by\r\nthe suffrages (χειροτονία) of the people. Before entering on their\r\nduties they were required to submit to a _docimasia_, or examination\r\nof their character; and no one was eligible to the office unless\r\nhe had legitimate children, and was possessed of landed property\r\nin Attica. They were, as their name denotes, entrusted with the\r\ncommand on military expeditions, with the superintendence of all\r\nwarlike preparations, and with the regulation of all matters in any\r\nway connected with the war department of the state. They levied and\r\nenlisted the soldiers, either personally or with the assistance of\r\nthe taxiarchs. They were entrusted with the collection and management\r\nof the property-taxes (εἰσφοραί) raised for the purposes of war;\r\nand also presided over the courts of justice in which any disputes\r\nconnected with this subject or the trierarchy were decided. They\r\nnominated from year to year persons to serve as trierarchs. They had\r\nthe power of convening extraordinary assemblies of the people in\r\ncases of emergency. But their most important trust was the command\r\nin war, and it depended upon circumstances to how many of the number\r\nit was given. At Marathon all the ten were present, and the chief\r\ncommand came to each of them in turn. The archon polemarchus also was\r\nthere associated with them, and, according to the ancient custom, his\r\nvote in a council of war was equal to that of any of the generals.\r\nUsually, however, three only were sent out; one of these (τρίτος\r\nαὐτός) was considered as the commander-in-chief, but his colleagues\r\nhad an equal voice in a council of war. The military chiefs of the\r\nAetolian and Achaean leagues were also called _strategi_. The Achaean\r\n_strategi_ had the power of convening a general assembly of the\r\nleague on extraordinary occasions. Greek writers on Roman affairs\r\ngive the name of _strategi_ to the praetors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRĒNA, a present given on a festive day, and for the sake of good\r\nomen. It was chiefly applied to a new year’s gift, to a present made\r\non the calends of January. In accordance with a senatusconsultum, new\r\nyear’s gifts had to be presented to Augustus in the Capitol, even\r\nwhen he was absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRĬGIL. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRŎPHĬUM (ταινία, ταινίδιον, ἀπόδεσμος), a girdle or belt worn\r\nby women round the breast and over the inner tunic or chemise. It\r\nappears to have been usually made of leather.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUPRUM. [ADULTERIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSIGNĀNI, privileged soldiers in the time of the empire, who fought\r\nunder a standard by themselves, and did not form part of the legion.\r\nThey seem to have been the same as the _vexillarii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUFFRĀGĬA SEX. [EQUITES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUFFRĀGĬUM, a vote. At Athens the voting in the popular assemblies\r\nand the courts of justice was either by show of hands (χειροτονία)\r\nor by ballot (ψῆφος). Respecting the mode of voting at Rome, see\r\nCOMITIA, p. 107, and LEGES TABELLARIAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTUS, means in general any elevated place made of materials\r\nheaped up (_sub_ and _gero_), and is specially applied: (1) To the\r\nstage or pulpit from which the orators addressed the people in\r\nthe comitia. [ROSTRA.]--(2) To the elevation from which a general\r\naddressed the soldiers.--(3) To the elevated seat from which the\r\nemperor beheld the public games, also called _cubiculum_. [CUBICULUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUOVĔTAURĪLĬA. [SACRIFICIUM, p. 325; LUSTRATIO; and woodcut on p.\r\n343.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPĂRUM. [NAVIS, p. 267, _b_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLĬCĀTĬO, a solemn thanksgiving or supplication to the gods,\r\ndecreed by the senate, when all the temples were opened, and the\r\nstatues of the gods frequently placed in public upon couches\r\n(_pulvinaria_), to which the people offered up their thanksgivings\r\nand prayers. [LECTISTERNIUM.] A _supplicatio_ was decreed for two\r\ndifferent reasons. 1. As a thanksgiving, when a great victory had\r\nbeen gained: it was usually decreed as soon as official intelligence\r\nof the victory had been received by a letter from the general\r\nin command. The number of days during which it was to last was\r\nproportioned to the importance of the victory. Sometimes it was\r\ndecreed for only one day, but more commonly for three or five days. A\r\nsupplication of ten days was first decreed in honour of Pompey at the\r\nconclusion of the war with Mithridates, and one of fifteen days after\r\nthe victory over the Belgae by Caesar, an honour which had never been\r\ngranted to any one before. Subsequently a supplicatio of twenty days\r\nwas decreed after his conquest of Vercingetorix. A supplicatio was\r\nusually regarded as a prelude to a triumph, but it was not always\r\nfollowed by one. This honour was conferred upon Cicero on account\r\nof his suppression of the conspiracy of Catiline, which had never\r\nbeen decreed to any one before in a civil capacity (_togatus_).--2.\r\nA _supplicatio_, a solemn supplication and humiliation, was also\r\ndecreed in times of public danger and distress, and on account of\r\nprodigies, to avert the anger of the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\nSȲCŎPHANTĒS (συκοφάντης). At an early period in Attic history a law\r\nwas made prohibiting the exportation of figs. Whether it was made\r\nin a time of dearth, or through the foolish policy of preserving to\r\nthe natives the most valuable of their productions, we cannot say.\r\nIt appears, however, that the law continued in force long after the\r\ncause of its enactment, or the general belief of its utility, had\r\nceased to exist; and Attic fig-growers exported their fruit in\r\nspite of prohibitions and penalties. To inform against a man for\r\nso doing was considered harsh and vexatious; as all people are apt\r\nto think that obsolete statutes may be infringed with impunity.\r\nHence the term συκοφαντεῖν, which originally signified _to lay an\r\ninformation against another for exporting figs_, came to be applied\r\nto all ill-natured, malicious, groundless, and vexatious accusations.\r\n_Sycophantes_ in the time of Aristophanes and Demosthenes designated\r\na person of a peculiar class, not capable of being described by any\r\nsingle word in our language, but well understood and appreciated by\r\nan Athenian. He had not much in common with our _sycophant_, but was\r\na happy compound of the _common barrator, informer, pettifogger,\r\nbusybody, rogue, liar, and slanderer_. The Athenian law permitted\r\nany citizen (τὸν βουλόμενον) to give information against public\r\noffenders, and prosecute them in courts of justice. It was the\r\npolicy of the legislator to encourage the detection of crime, and\r\na reward (such as half the penalty) was frequently given to the\r\nsuccessful accuser. Such a power, with such a temptation, was likely\r\nto be abused, unless checked by the force of public opinion, or the\r\nvigilance of the judicial tribunals. Unfortunately, the character\r\nof the Athenian democracy and the temper of the judges furnished\r\nadditional incentives to the informer. Eminent statesmen, orators,\r\ngenerals, magistrates, and all persons of wealth and influence\r\nwere regarded with jealousy by the people. The more causes came\r\ninto court, the more fees accrued to the judges, and fines and\r\nconfiscations enriched the public treasury. The prosecutor therefore\r\nin public causes, as well as the plaintiff in civil, was looked\r\non with a more favourable eye than the defendant, and the chances\r\nof success made the employment a lucrative one. It was not always\r\nnecessary to go to trial, or even to commence legal proceedings. The\r\ntimid defendant was glad to compromise the cause, and the conscious\r\ndelinquent to avert the threat of a prosecution, by paying a sum of\r\nmoney to his opponent. Thriving informers found it not very difficult\r\nto procure witnesses, and the profits were divided between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSȲLAE (σῦλαι). When a Greek state, or any of its members, had\r\nreceived an injury or insult from some other state or some of its\r\nmembers, and the former was unwilling, or not in a condition, to\r\ndeclare open war, it was not unusual to give a commission, or grant\r\npublic authority to individuals to make reprisals. This was called\r\nσύλας, or σῦλα, διδόναι. This ancient practice may be compared with\r\nthe modern one of granting letters of marque and reprisal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYLLOGEIS (συλλογεῖς), usually called Συλλογεῖς τοῦ δήμου, or the\r\nCollectors of the People, were special commissioners at Athens, who\r\nmade out a list of the property of the oligarchs previously to its\r\nconfiscation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMBOLAEON, SỸNALLAGMA, SYNTHĒCĒ (συμβόλαιον, συνάλλαγμα, συνθήκη),\r\nare all words used to signify a contract, but are distinguishable\r\nfrom one another. Συμβόλαιον is used of contracts and bargains between\r\nprivate persons, and peculiarly of loans of money. Thus, συμβαλεῖν\r\nεἰς ἀνδράποδον is, to lend upon the security of a slave. Συνάλλαγμα\r\nsignifies any matter negotiated or transacted between two or more\r\npersons, whether a contract or anything else. Συνθήκη is used of\r\nmore solemn and important contracts, not only of those made between\r\nprivate individuals, but also of treaties and conventions between\r\nkings and states.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPŎSĬUM (συμπόσιον, _comissatio_, _convivium_), a drinking-party.\r\nThe _symposium_ must be distinguished from the _deipnon_ (δεῖπνον),\r\nfor though drinking almost always followed a dinner-party, yet\r\nthe former was regarded as entirely distinct from the latter, was\r\nregulated by different customs, and frequently received the addition\r\nof many guests, who were not present at the dinner. For the Greeks\r\ndid not usually drink at their dinner, and it was not till the\r\nconclusion of the meal that wine was introduced. Symposia were very\r\nfrequent at Athens. Their enjoyment was heightened by agreeable\r\nconversation, by the introduction of music and dancing, and by games\r\nand amusements of various kinds: sometimes, too, philosophical\r\nsubjects were discussed at them. The symposia of Plato and Xenophon\r\ngive us a lively idea of such entertainments at Athens. The name\r\nitself shows, that the enjoyment of drinking was the main object of\r\nthe symposia: wine from the juice of the grape (οἴνος ἀμπέλινος)\r\nwas the only drink partaken of by the Greeks, with the exception\r\nof water. The wine was almost invariably mixed with water, and\r\nto drink it unmixed (ἄκρατον) was considered a characteristic of\r\nbarbarians. The mixture was made in a large vessel called the CRATER,\r\nfrom which it was conveyed into the drinking-cups. The guests at a\r\nsymposium reclined on couches, and were crowned with garlands of\r\nflowers. A master of the revels (ἄρχων τῆς πόσεως, συμποσίαρχος,\r\nor βασιλεύς) was usually chosen to conduct the symposium, whose\r\ncommands the whole company had to obey, and who regulated the whole\r\norder of the entertainment, proposed the amusements, &c. The same\r\npractice prevailed among the Romans, and their symposiarch was\r\ncalled _Magister_, or _Rex Convivii_, or the _Arbiter Bibendi_.\r\nThe choice was generally determined by the throwing of astragali\r\nor tali. The proportion in which the wine and water were mixed was\r\nfixed by him, and also how much each of the company was to drink,\r\nfor it was not usually left to the option of each of the company\r\nto drink as much or as little as he pleased. The cups were always\r\ncarried round from right to left (ἐπὶ δεξιά), and the same order\r\nwas observed in the conversation, and in everything that took place\r\nin the entertainment. The company frequently drank to the health\r\nof one another, and each did it especially to the one to whom he\r\nhanded the same cup. Respecting the games and amusements by which\r\nthe symposia were enlivened, it is unnecessary to say much here,\r\nas most of them are described in separate articles in this work.\r\nEnigmas or riddles (αἰνίγματα or γρῖφοι) were among the most usual and\r\nfavourite modes of diversion. Each of the company proposed one in\r\nturn to his right-hand neighbour; if he solved it, he was rewarded\r\nwith a crown, a garland, a cake, or something of a similar kind, and\r\nsometimes with a kiss; if he failed, he had to drink a cup of unmixed\r\nwine, or of wine mixed with salt water, at one draught. The cottabos\r\nwas also another favourite game at symposia, and was played at in\r\nvarious ways. [COTTABUS.] Representations of symposia are very common\r\non ancient vases. Two guests usually reclined on each couch (κλίνη),\r\nas is explained on p. 95, but sometimes there were five persons on\r\none couch. A drinking-party among the Romans was sometimes called\r\n_convivium_, but the word _comissatio_ more nearly corresponds to the\r\nGreek symposium. [COMISSATIO.] The Romans, however, usually drank\r\nduring their dinner (_coena_), which they frequently prolonged during\r\nmany hours, in the later times of the republic and under the empire.\r\nTheir customs connected with drinking differed little from those of\r\nthe Greeks, and have been incidentally noticed above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Symposium (From a Painting on a Vase.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNDĬCUS (σύνδικος), _an advocate_, is frequently used as synonymous\r\nwith the word _synegorus_ (συνήγορος), to denote any one who pleads\r\nthe cause of another, whether in a court of justice or elsewhere,\r\nbut was peculiarly applied to those orators who were sent by the\r\nstate to plead the cause of their countrymen before a foreign\r\ntribunal. Aeschines, for example, was appointed to plead before\r\nthe Amphictyonic council on the subject of the Delian temple; but\r\na certain discovery having been made, not very creditable to his\r\npatriotism, the court of Arciopagus took upon themselves to remove\r\nhim, and appoint Hyperides in his stead. There were other _syndici_,\r\nwho acted rather as magistrates or judges than as advocates, though\r\nthey probably derived their name from the circumstance of their\r\nbeing appointed to protect the interests of the state. These were\r\nextraordinary functionaries, created from time to time to exercise a\r\njurisdiction in disputes concerning confiscated property.\r\n\r\n\r\nSỸNĔDRI (σύνεδροι), a name given to the members of any council,\r\nor any body of men who sat together to consult or deliberate. The\r\ncongress of Greeks at Salamis is called συνέδριον. Frequent reference\r\nis made to the general assembly of the Greeks, τὸ κοινὸν τῶν Ἑλλήνων\r\nσυνέδριον, at Corinth, Thermopylae, or elsewhere. The congress of\r\nthe states belonging to the new Athenian alliance, formed after B.C.\r\n377, was called συνέδριον, and the deputies σύνεδροι, and the sums\r\nfurnished by the allies συντάξεις, in order to avoid the old and\r\nhateful name of φόρος or tribute. The name of συνέδριον was given\r\nat Athens to any magisterial or official body, as to the court of\r\nAreiopagus, or to the place where they transacted business, their\r\nboard or council-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nSỸNĒGŎRUS (συνήγορος). In causes of importance, wherein the state was\r\nmaterially interested, more especially in those which were brought\r\nbefore the court upon an εἰσαγγελία, it was usual to appoint public\r\nadvocates (called συνήγοροι, σύνδικοι, or κατήγοροι) to manage the\r\nprosecution. In ordinary cases however the accuser or prosecutor\r\n(κατήγορος) was a distinct person from the συνήγορος, who acted\r\nonly as auxiliary to him. It might be, indeed, that the συνήγορος\r\nperformed the most important part at the trial, or it might be that\r\nhe performed a subordinate part, making only a short speech in\r\nsupport of the prosecution, which was called ἐπίλογος. But however\r\nthis might be, he was in point of law an auxiliary only, and was\r\nneither entitled to a share of the reward (if any) given by the law\r\nto a successful accuser, nor liable, on the other hand, to a penalty\r\nof a thousand drachms, or the ἀτιμία consequent upon a failure to\r\nget a fifth part of the votes. The fee of a drachm (τὸ συνηγορικόν)\r\nmentioned by Aristophanes was probably the sum paid to the public\r\nadvocate whenever he was employed on behalf of the state. There\r\nappears to have been (at least at one period) a regular appointment\r\nof συνήγοροι, ten in number. For what purpose they were appointed, is\r\na matter about which we have no certain information: but it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose that these ten συνήγοροι were no other than\r\nthe public advocates who were employed to conduct state prosecutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNGRĂPHĒ (συγγραφή), signifies a written contract: whereas συνθήκη\r\nand συμβόλαιον do not necessarily import that the contract is in\r\nwriting; and ὁμολογία is, strictly speaking, a verbal agreement. At\r\nAthens important contracts were usually reduced to writing; such as\r\nleases (μισθώσεις), loans of money, and all executory agreements,\r\nwhere certain conditions were to be performed. The whole was\r\ncontained in a little tablet of wax or wood (βιβλίον or γραμματεῖον,\r\nsometimes double, δίπτυχον), which was sealed, and deposited with\r\nsome third person, mutually agreed on between the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSỸNOIKĬA (συνοίκια).--(1) A festival celebrated every year at Athens\r\non the 16th of Hecatombaeon in honour of Athena. It was believed to\r\nhave been instituted by Theseus to commemorate the concentration of\r\nthe government of the various towns of Attica at Athens.--(2) A house\r\nadapted to hold several families, a lodging-house, _insula_, as the\r\nRomans would say. The lodging-houses were let mostly to foreigners\r\nwho came to Athens on business, and especially to the μέτοικοι, whom\r\nthe law did not allow to acquire real property, and who therefore\r\ncould not purchase houses of their own. The rent was commonly paid\r\nby the month. Lodging-houses were frequently taken on speculation\r\nby persons called ναύκληροι or σταθμοῦχοι, who made a profit by\r\nunderletting them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTHĔSIS, a garment frequently worn at dinner, and sometimes also on\r\nother occasions. As it was inconvenient to wear the toga at table,\r\non account of its many folds, it was customary to have dresses\r\nespecially appropriated to this purpose, called _vestes coenatoriae_,\r\nor _coenatoria_, _accubitoria_, or _syntheses_. The synthesis\r\nappears to have been a kind of tunic, an _indumentum_ rather than an\r\n_amictus_. [AMICTUS.] That it was, however, an easy and comfortable\r\nkind of dress, as we should say, seems to be evident from its use at\r\ntable above mentioned, and also from its being worn by all classes at\r\nthe SATURNALIA, a season of universal relaxation and enjoyment. More\r\nthan this respecting its form we cannot say; it was usually dyed with\r\nsome colour, and was not white, like the toga.\r\n\r\n\r\nSȲRINX (σύριγξ), the Pan’s pipe, or Pandean pipe, was the appropriate\r\nmusical instrument of the Arcadian and other Grecian shepherds, and\r\nwas regarded by them as the invention of Pan, their tutelary god.\r\nWhen the Roman poets had occasion to mention it, they called it\r\n_fistula_. It was formed in general of seven hollow stems of cane or\r\nreed, fitted together by means of wax, having been previously cut\r\nto the proper lengths, and adjusted so as to form an octave; but\r\nsometimes nine were admitted, giving an equal number of notes. A\r\nsyrinx of eight reeds is represented on p. 278.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pan with a Syrinx. (Mus. Worsleyanum, pl. 9.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYRMA (σύρμα), which properly means that which is drawn or dragged\r\n(from σύρω), is applied to a dress with a train. It was more\r\nespecially the name of the dress worn by the tragic actors, which had\r\na train to it trailing upon the ground. Hence we find _syrma_ used\r\nmetaphorically for tragedy itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSSĪTĬA (συσσίτια). The custom of taking the principal meal of the\r\nday in public prevailed extensively amongst the Greeks from very\r\nearly ages, but more particularly in Crete and at Sparta. The Cretan\r\nname for the syssitia was _Andreia_ (ἀνδρεῖα), the singular of which\r\nis used to denote the building or public hall where they were given.\r\nThis title affords of itself a sufficient indication that they were\r\nconfined to men and youths only. All the adult citizens partook of\r\nthe public meals amongst the Cretans, and were divided into companies\r\nor “messes,” called _hetaeriae_ (ἑταιρίαι), or sometimes _andreia_.\r\nThe syssitia of the Cretans were distinguished by simplicity and\r\ntemperance. They always _sat_ at their tables, even in later times,\r\nwhen the custom of reclining had been introduced at Sparta. In most\r\nof the Cretan cities, the expenses of the syssitia were defrayed\r\nout of the revenues of the public lands, and the tribute paid by\r\nthe perioeci, the money arising from which was applied partly to\r\nthe service of the gods, and partly to the maintenance of all the\r\ncitizens, both male and female; so that in this respect there might\r\nbe no difference between the rich and the poor. The Spartan syssitia\r\nwere in the main so similar to those of Crete, that one was said to\r\nbe borrowed from the other. They differed from the Cretan in the\r\nfollowing respects. The expenses of the tables at Sparta were not\r\ndefrayed out of the public revenues, but every head of a family was\r\nobliged to contribute a certain portion at his own cost and charge;\r\nthose who were not able to do so were excluded from the public\r\ntables. The guests were divided into companies, generally of fifteen\r\npersons each, and all vacancies were filled up by ballot, in which\r\nunanimous consent was indispensable for election. No persons, not\r\neven the kings, were excused from attendance at the public tables,\r\nexcept for some satisfactory reason, as when engaged in a sacrifice,\r\nor a chase, in which latter case the individual was required to send\r\na present to his table. Each person was supplied with a cup of mixed\r\nwine, which was filled again when required: but drinking to excess\r\nwas prohibited at Sparta as well as in Crete. The repast was of a\r\nplain and simple character, and the contribution of each member of\r\na mess (φειδίτης) was settled by law. The principal dish was the\r\nblack broth (μέλας ζωμός), with pork. Moreover, the entertainment\r\nwas enlivened by cheerful conversation, though on public matters.\r\nSinging also was frequently introduced. The arrangements were under\r\nthe superintendence of the polemarchs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂBELLA, _dim._ of TĂBŬLA, a billet or tablet, with which each\r\ncitizen and judex voted in the comitia and courts of justice. For\r\ndetails see pp. 107, 236.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂBELLĀRĬUS, a letter-carrier. As the Romans had no public post,\r\nthey were obliged to employ special messengers, who were called\r\n_tabellarii_, to convey their letters (_tabellae_, _literae_), when\r\nthey had not an opportunity of sending them otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂBERNĀCŬLUM. [TEMPLUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLĪNUM. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂBŬLAE. This word properly means planks or boards, whence it is\r\napplied to several objects, as gaming-tables, pictures, but more\r\nespecially to tablets used for writing. Generally, _tabulae_ and\r\n_tabellae_ signify waxen tablets (_tabulae ceratae_), which were\r\nthin pieces of wood, usually of an oblong shape, covered over with\r\nwax (_cera_). The wax was written on by means of the stilus. These\r\ntabulae were sometimes made of ivory and citron-wood, but generally\r\nof the wood of a more common tree, as the beech, fir, &c. The outer\r\nsides of the tablets consisted merely of the wood; it was only the\r\ninner sides that were covered over with wax. They were fastened\r\ntogether at the back by means of wires, which answered the purpose of\r\nhinges, so that they opened and shut like our books; and to prevent\r\nthe wax of one tablet nibbing against the wax of the other, there\r\nwas a raised margin around each, as is clearly seen in the woodcut\r\non p. 354. There were sometimes two, three, four, five, or even\r\nmore, tablets fastened together in the above-mentioned manner. Two\r\nsuch tablets were called _diptycha_ (δίπτυχα), which merely means\r\n“twice-folded” (from πτύσσω, “to fold”), whence we have πτυκτίον, or\r\nwith the τ omitted, πυκτίον. The Latin word _pugillares_, which is\r\nthe name frequently given to tablets covered with wax, may perhaps\r\nbe connected with the same root, though it is usually derived from\r\n_pugillus_, because they were small enough to be held in the hand.\r\nThree tablets fastened together were called _triptycha_; in the\r\nsame way we also read of _pentaptycha_, and of _polyptycha_ or\r\n_multiplices_ (_cerae_). The pages of these tablets were frequently\r\ncalled by the name of cerae alone; thus we read of _prima cera_,\r\n_altera cera_, “first page,” “second page.” In tablets containing\r\nimportant legal documents, especially wills, the outer edges were\r\npierced through with holes (_foramina_), through which a triple\r\nthread (_linum_) was passed, and upon which a seal was then placed.\r\nThis was intended to guard against forgery, and if it was not done\r\nsuch documents were null and void. Waxen tablets were used among the\r\nRomans for almost every species of writing, where great length was\r\nnot required. Thus letters were frequently written upon them, which\r\nwere secured by being fastened together with packthread and sealed\r\nwith wax. Legal documents, and especially wills, were almost always\r\nwritten on waxen tablets. Such tablets were also used for accounts,\r\nin which a person entered what he received and expended (_tabulae_ or\r\n_codex accepti et expensi_), whence _novae tabulae_ mean an abolition\r\nof debts either wholly or in part. The tablets used in voting in the\r\ncomitia and the courts of justice were also called tabulae, as well\r\nas tabellae. [TABELLA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂBŬLĀRĬI were notaries or accountants, who are first mentioned under\r\nthis name in the time of the empire. Public notaries, who had the\r\ncharge of public documents, were also called tabularii. They were\r\nfirst established by M. Antoninus in the provinces, who ordained that\r\nthe births of all children were to be announced to the tabularii\r\nwithin thirty days from the birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂBŬLĀRĬUM, a place where the public records (_tabulae publicae_)\r\nwere kept. These records were of various kinds, as for instance\r\nsenatusconsulta, tabulae censoriae, registers of births, deaths,\r\nof the names of those who assumed the toga virilis, &c. There were\r\nvarious tabularia at Rome, all of which were in temples; we find\r\nmention made of tabularia in the temples of the Nymphs, of Lucina,\r\nof Juventus, of Libitina, of Ceres, and more especially in that of\r\nSaturn, which was also the public treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAGUS (ταγός), a leader or general, was more especially the name of\r\nthe military leader of the Thessalians. He is sometimes called _king_\r\n(βασιλεύς). His command was of a military rather than of a civil\r\nnature, and he seems only to have been appointed when there was a war\r\nor one was apprehended. We do not know the extent of the power which\r\nthe Tagus possessed constitutionally, nor the time for which he held\r\nthe office; probably neither was precisely fixed, and depended on the\r\ncircumstances of the times and the character of the individual.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĀLĀRĬA, small wings, fixed to the ancles of Hermes and reckoned\r\namong his attributes (πέδιλα, πτηνοπέδιλος). In many works of ancient\r\nart they are represented growing from his ancles (see cut, p. 63);\r\nbut more frequently he is represented with sandals, which have wings\r\nfastened to them on each side over the ancles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Talaria. (From a Statue of Hermes at Naples.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂLASSĬO. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂLENTUM (τάλαντον) meant originally _a balance_ [LIBRA], then\r\nthe substance weighed, and lastly and commonly a certain weight,\r\n_the talent_. The Greek system of money, as well as the Roman\r\n[AS], was founded on a reference to weight. A certain weight of\r\nsilver among the Greeks, as of copper among the Romans, was used\r\nas a representative of a value, which was originally and generally\r\nthat of the metal itself. The talent therefore and its divisions\r\nare denominations of money as well as of weight. The Greek system\r\nof weights contained four principal denominations, which, though\r\ndifferent in different times and places, and even at the same place\r\nfor different substances, always bore the same relation _to each\r\nother_. These were the talent (τάλαντον), which was the largest,\r\nthen the mina (μνᾶ), the drachma (δραχμή), and the obolus (ὀβολός).\r\n[See Tables.] The Attic and Aeginetan were the two standards of\r\nmoney most in use in Greece. The Attic mina was 4_l._ 1_s._ 3_d._,\r\nand the talent 243_l._ 15_s._ The Aeginetan mina was 5_l._ 14_s._\r\n7_d._, and the talent 343_l._ 15_s._ The Euboic talent was of nearly\r\nthe same weight as the Attic. A much smaller talent was in use for\r\ngold. It was equal to six Attic drachmae, or about ¾ oz. and 71 grs.\r\nIt was called the _gold talent_, or the _Sicilian talent_, from\r\nits being much used by the Greeks of Italy and Sicily. This is the\r\ntalent always meant when the word occurs in Homer. This small talent\r\nexplains the use of the term _great talent_ (_magnum talentum_),\r\nwhich we find in Latin authors, for the silver Attic talent was\r\n_great_ in comparison with this. But the use of the word by the\r\nRomans is altogether very inexact. Where talents are mentioned in the\r\nclassical writers without any specification of the standard, we must\r\ngenerally understand the Attic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĀLĬO, from Talis, signifies an equivalent, but it is used only in\r\nthe sense of a punishment or penalty the same in kind and degree as\r\nthe mischief which the guilty person has done to the body of another.\r\nTalio, as a punishment, was a part of the Mosaic law.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĀLUS (ἀστράγαλος), a huckle-bone. The huckle-bones of sheep and\r\ngoats were used to play with from the earliest times, principally by\r\nwomen and children, occasionally by old men. To play at this game was\r\nsometimes called πενταλιθίζειν, because five bones or other objects\r\nof a similar kind were employed; and this number is retained among\r\nourselves. When the sides of the bone were marked with different\r\nvalues, the game became one of chance. [ALEA; TESSERA.] The two ends\r\nwere left blank, because the bone could not rest upon either of them\r\non account of its curvature. The four remaining sides were marked\r\nwith the numbers 1, 3, 4, 6; 1 and 6 being on two opposite sides, and\r\n3 and 4 on the other two opposite sides. The Greek and Latin names\r\nof the numbers were as follows:--1. Μονάς, εἶς, κύων, Χῖος; Ion.\r\nΟἴνη: _Unio_, _Vulturius_, _canis_: 3. Τρίας, _Ternio_; 4. Τετράς,\r\n_Quaternio_; 6. Ἑξάς, ἑξίτης, Κῷος; _Senio_. Two persons played\r\ntogether at this game, using four bones, which they threw up into\r\nthe air, or emptied out of a dice-box, and observing the numbers on\r\nthe uppermost sides. The numbers on the four sides of the four bones\r\nadmitted of thirty-five different combinations. The lowest throw of\r\nall was four aces (_jacere vultorios quatuor_). But the value of a\r\nthrow was not in all cases the sum of the four numbers turned up.\r\nThe highest in value was that called _Venus_, or _jactus Venereus_,\r\nin which the numbers cast up were all different, the sum of them\r\nbeing only fourteen. It was by obtaining this throw that the king\r\nof the feast was appointed among the Romans [SYMPOSIUM], and hence\r\nit was also called _Basilicus_. Certain other throws were called by\r\nparticular names, taken from gods, illustrious men and women, and\r\nheroes. Thus the throw, consisting of two aces and two trays, making\r\neight, which number, like the jactus Venereus, could be obtained only\r\nonce, was denominated _Stesichorus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Game of Tali. (From an ancient Painting.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĂMĬAE (ταμίαι), the treasurers of the temples and the revenue at\r\nAthens. The wealthiest of all the temples at Athens was that of\r\nAthena on the Acropolis, the treasures of which were under the\r\nguardianship of ten _tamiae_, who were chosen annually by lot from\r\nthe class of pentacosiomedimni, and afterwards, when the distinction\r\nof classes had ceased to exist, from among the wealthiest of Athenian\r\ncitizens. The treasurers of the other gods were chosen in like\r\nmanner; but they, about the 90th Olympiad, were all united into one\r\nboard, while those of Athena remained distinct. Their treasury,\r\nhowever, was transferred to the same place as that of Athena, viz.,\r\nto the opisthodomus of the Parthenon, where were kept not only all\r\nthe treasures belonging to the temples, but also the state treasure\r\n(ὅσια χρήματα, as contra-distinguished from ἱερά), under the\r\ncare of the treasurers of Athena. All the funds of the state were\r\nconsidered as being in a manner consecrated to Athena; while on the\r\nother hand the people reserved to themselves the right of making\r\nuse of the sacred monies, as well as the other property of the\r\ntemples, if the safety of the state should require it. Payments\r\nmade to the temples were received by the treasurers in the presence\r\nof some members of the senate, just as public monies were by the\r\nApodectae; and then the treasurers became responsible for their\r\nsafe custody.--The treasurer of the revenue (ταμίας or ἐπιμελητής\r\nτῆς κοινῆς προσόδου) was a more important personage than those last\r\nmentioned. He was not a mere keeper of monies, like them, nor a mere\r\nreceiver, like the apodectae; but a general paymaster, who received\r\nthrough the apodectae all money which was to be disbursed for the\r\npurposes of the administration (except the property-taxes, which were\r\npaid into the war-office, and the tribute from the allies, which was\r\npaid to the hellenotamiae [HELLENOTAMIAE]), and then distributed\r\nit in such manner as he was required to do by the law; the surplus\r\n(if any) he paid into the war-office or the theoric fund. As this\r\nperson knew all the channels in which the public money had to flow,\r\nand exercised a general superintendence over the expenditure, he\r\nwas competent to give advice to the people upon financial measures,\r\nwith a view to improve the revenue, introduce economy, and prevent\r\nabuses; he is sometimes called ταμίας τῆς διοικήσεως, or ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς\r\nδιοικήσεως, and may be regarded as a sort of minister of finance.\r\nHe was elected by vote (χειροτονία), and held his office for four\r\nyears, but was capable of being re-elected. A law, however, was\r\npassed during the administration of Lycurgus, the orator, prohibiting\r\nre-election; so that Lycurgus, who is reported to have continued\r\nin office for twelve years, must have held it for the last eight\r\nyears under fictitious names. The power of this officer was by no\r\nmeans free from control; inasmuch as any individual was at liberty\r\nto propose financial measures, or institute criminal proceedings\r\nfor malversation or waste of the public funds; and there was an\r\nἀντιγραφεὺς τῆς διοικήσεως appointed to check the accounts of his\r\nsuperior. Anciently there were persons called _Poristae_ (πορίσται),\r\nwho appear to have assisted the tamiae in some part of their duties.\r\nThe money disbursed by the treasurer of the revenue was sometimes\r\npaid directly to the various persons in the employ of the government,\r\nsometimes through subordinate pay offices. Many public functionaries\r\nhad their own paymasters, who were dependent on the treasurer of\r\nthe revenue, receiving their funds from him, and then distributing\r\nthem in their respective departments. Such were the τριηροποιοί,\r\nτειχοποιοί, ὁδοποιοί, ταφροποιοί, ἐπεμεληταὶ νεωρίων, who received\r\nthrough their own tamiae such sums as they required from time to time\r\nfor the prosecution of their works. The payment of the judicial fees\r\nwas made by the _Colacretae_ (κωλακρέται), which, and the providing\r\nfor the meals in the Prytaneium, were the only duties that remained\r\nto them after the establishment of the apodectae by Cleisthenes. The\r\ntamiae of the sacred vessels (τῆς Παράλου and τῆς Σαλαμινίας) acted\r\nnot only as treasurers, but as trierarchs, the expenses (amounting\r\nfor the two ships together to about sixteen talents) being provided\r\nby the state. They were elected by vote. Other trierarchs had their\r\nown private tamiae.--The war fund at Athens (independently of the\r\ntribute) was provided from two sources: first, the property-tax\r\n(εἰσφορά), and secondly, the surplus of the yearly revenue, which\r\nremained after defraying the expenses of the civil administration.\r\nOf the ten strategi, who were annually elected to preside over the\r\nwar department, one was called στρατηγὸς ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς διοικήσεως, to\r\nwhom the management of the war fund was entrusted. He had under him\r\na treasurer, called the ταμίας τῶν στρατιωτικῶν, who gave out the\r\npay of the troops, and defrayed all other expenses incident to the\r\nservice. So much of the surplus revenue as was not required for the\r\npurposes of war, was to be paid by the treasurer of the revenue into\r\nthe theoric fund; of which, after the archonship of Euclides, special\r\nmanagers were created. [THEORICA.]--Lastly, we have to notice the\r\ntreasurers of the demi (δήμων ταμίαι), and those of the tribes (φυλῶν\r\nταμίαι), who had the care of the funds belonging to their respective\r\ncommunities, and performed duties analogous to those of the state\r\ntreasurers. The demi, as well as the tribes, had their common lands,\r\nwhich were usually let to farm. The rents of these formed the\r\nprincipal part of their revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAXIARCHI (ταξίαρχοι), military officers at Athens, next in rank\r\nto the strategi. They were ten in number, like the strategi, one\r\nfor each tribe, and were elected by vote (χειροτονία). In war each\r\ncommanded the infantry of his own tribe, and they were frequently\r\ncalled to assist the strategi with their advice at the war-council.\r\nIn peace they assisted the strategi in levying and enlisting\r\nsoldiers, and seem to have also assisted the _strategi_ in the\r\ndischarge of many of their other duties. The taxiarchs were so called\r\nfrom their commanding _taxeis_ (τάξεις), which were the principal\r\ndivisions of the hoplites in the Athenian army. Each tribe (φυλή)\r\nformed a _taxis_. As there were ten tribes, there were consequently\r\nin a complete Athenian army ten _taxeis_, but the number of men\r\ncontained in each would of course vary according to the importance of\r\nthe war. Among the other Greeks, the _taxis_ was the name of a much\r\nsmaller division of troops. The _lochus_ (λόχος) among the Athenians\r\nwas a subdivision of the _taxis_, and the _lochagi_ (λοχαγοί) were\r\nprobably appointed by the taxiarchs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĒGŬLA (κέραμος, _dim._ κεραμίς), a roofing-tile. Roofing-tiles were\r\noriginally made, like bricks, of baked clay (γῆς ὀπτῆς). Byzes of\r\nNaxos first introduced tiles of marble about the year 620 B.C. A\r\nstill more expensive and magnificent method of roofing consisted in\r\nthe use of tiles made of bronze and gilt. At Rome the houses were\r\noriginally roofed with shingles, and continued to be so down to the\r\ntime of the war with Pyrrhus, when tiles began to supersede the old\r\nroofing material.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEICHŎPOII (τειχοποιοί), magistrates at Athens, whose business it was\r\nto build and keep in repair the public walls. They appear to have\r\nbeen elected by vote (χειροτονία), one from each tribe, and probably\r\nfor a year. Funds were put at their disposal, for which they had\r\ntheir treasurer (ταμίας) dependent on the treasurer of the revenue.\r\nThey were liable to render an account (εὐθύνη) of their management\r\nof these funds, and also of their general conduct, like other\r\nmagistrates. This office has been invested with peculiar interest in\r\nmodern times, on account of its having been held by Demosthenes, and\r\nits having given occasion to the famous prosecution of Ctesiphon, who\r\nproposed that Demosthenes should receive the honour of a crown before\r\nhe had rendered his account according to law.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĒLA (ἱστός), a loom. Although weaving was among the Greeks and\r\nRomans a distinct trade, carried on by a separate class of persons\r\n(ὑφάνται, _textores_ and _textrices_, _linteones_), yet every\r\nconsiderable domestic establishment, especially in the country,\r\ncontained a loom, together with the whole apparatus necessary for the\r\nworking of wool (_lanificium_, ταλασία, ταλασιουργία). [CALATHUS.]\r\nThese occupations were all supposed to be carried on under the\r\nprotection of Athena or Minerva, specially denominated _Ergane_\r\n(Ἐργάνη). When the farm or the palace was sufficiently large to admit\r\nof it, a portion of it called the _histon_ (ἱστῶν) or _textrinum_\r\nwas devoted to this purpose. The work was there principally carried\r\non by female slaves (_quasillariae_), under the superintendence\r\nof the mistress of the house. Every thing woven consists of two\r\nessential parts, the warp and the woof, called in Latin _stamen_ and\r\n_subtegmen_, _subtemen_, or _trama_; in Greek στήμων and κροκή. The\r\nwarp was called _stamen_ in Latin (from _stare_) on account of its\r\nerect posture in the loom. The corresponding Greek term στήμων, and\r\nlikewise ἱστός, have evidently the same derivation. For the same\r\nreason, the very first operation in weaving was to set up the loom\r\n(ἱστὸν στήσασθαι); and the web or cloth, before it was cut down or\r\n“descended” from the loom, was called _vestis pendens_ or _pendula\r\ntela_, because it hung from the transverse beam, or _jugum_. These\r\nparticulars are all clearly exhibited in the picture of Circe’s\r\nloom given in the annexed cut. We observe in the preceding woodcut,\r\nabout the middle of the apparatus, a transverse rod passing through\r\nthe warp. A straight cane was well adapted to be so used, and its\r\napplication is clearly expressed by Ovid in the words _stamen\r\nsecernit arundo_. In plain weaving it was inserted between the\r\nthreads of the warp so as to divide them into two portions, the\r\nthreads on one side of the rod alternating with those on the other\r\nside throughout the whole breadth of the warp. In a very ancient\r\nform of the loom there was a roller underneath the jugum, turned\r\nby a handle, and on which the web was wound as the work advanced.\r\nThe threads of the warp, besides being separated by a transverse\r\nrod or plank, were divided into thirty or forty parcels, to each of\r\nwhich a stone was suspended for the purpose of keeping the warp in\r\na perpendicular position, and allowing the necessary play to the\r\nstrokes of the spatha. Whilst the comparatively coarse, strong,\r\nand much-twisted thread designed for the warp was thus arranged in\r\nparallel lines, the woof remained upon the spindle [FUSUS], forming a\r\n_spool_, _bobbin_, or _pen_ (πήνη). This was either conveyed through\r\nthe warp without any additional contrivance, or it was made to\r\nrevolve in a shuttle (_radius_). This was made of box brought from\r\nthe shores of the Euxine, and was pointed at its extremities, that\r\nit might easily force its way through the warp. All that is effected\r\nby the shuttle is the conveyance of the woof across the warp. To\r\nkeep every thread of the woof in its proper place, it is necessary\r\nthat the threads of the warp should be decussated. This was done by\r\nthe leashes, called in Latin _licia_, in Greek μίτοι. By a leash we\r\nare to understand a thread having at one end a loop, through which\r\na thread of the warp was passed, the other end being fastened to a\r\nstraight rod called _liciatorium_, and in Greek κανών. The warp,\r\nhaving been divided by the arundo, as already mentioned, into two\r\nsets of threads, all those of the same set were passed through the\r\nloops of the corresponding set of leashes, and all these leashes were\r\nfastened at their other end to the same wooden rod. At least one set\r\nof leashes was necessary to decussate the warp, even in the plainest\r\nand simplest weaving. The number of sets was increased according to\r\nthe complexity of the pattern, which was called _bilix_ or _trilix_,\r\nδίμιτος, τρίμιτος, or πολύμιτος, according as the number was two,\r\nthree, or more. The process of annexing the leashes to the warp was\r\ncalled _ordiri telam_, also _licia telae addere_, or _adnectere_.\r\nIt occupied two women at the same time, one of whom took in regular\r\nsuccession each separate thread of the warp, and handed it over to\r\nthe other (παραφέρειν, παραδίδοναι, or προσφωρεῖσθαι); the other,\r\nas she received each thread, passed it through the loop in proper\r\norder; an act which we call “entering,” in Greek διάζεσθαι. Supposing\r\nthe warp to have been thus adjusted, and the pen or the shuttle to\r\nhave been carried through it, it was then decussated by drawing\r\nforwards the proper rod, so as to carry one set of the threads of\r\nthe warp across the rest, after which the woof was shot back again,\r\nand by the continual repetition of this process the warp and woof\r\nwere interlaced. Two staves were occasionally used to fix the rods\r\nin such a position as was most convenient to assist the weaver in\r\ndrawing her woof across her warp. After the woof had been conveyed\r\nby the shuttle through the warp, it was driven sometimes downwards,\r\nas is represented in the woodcut, but more commonly upwards. Two\r\ndifferent instruments were used in this part of the process. The\r\nsimplest, and probably the most ancient, was in the form of a large\r\nwooden sword (_spatha_, σπάθη). The spatha was, however, in a\r\ngreat degree superseded by the comb (_pecten_, κερκίς), the teeth\r\nof which were inserted between the threads of the warp, and thus\r\nmade by a forcible impulse to drive the threads of the woof close\r\ntogether.--The lyre, the favourite musical instrument of the Greeks,\r\nwas only known to the Romans as a foreign invention. Hence they\r\nappear to have described its parts by a comparison with the loom,\r\nwith which they were familiar. The terms _jugum_ and _stamina_ were\r\ntransferred by an obvious resemblance from the latter to the former\r\nobject; and, although they adopted into their own language the Greek\r\nword _plectrum_, they used the Latin _pecten_ to denote the same\r\nthing, not because the instrument used in striking the lyre was at\r\nall like a comb in shape and appearance, but because it was held in\r\nthe right hand, and inserted between the stamina of the lyre, as the\r\ncomb was between the stamina of the loom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tela, Loom. (From the Vatican MS. of Virgil.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĔLAMŌNES. [ATLANTES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĔLŌNES (τελώνης), a farmer of the public taxes at Athens. The taxes\r\nwere let by auction to the highest bidder. Companies often took them\r\nin the name of one person, who was called ἀρχώνης or τελωνάρχης, and\r\nwas their representative to the state. Sureties were required of\r\nthe farmer for the payment of his dues. The office was frequently\r\nundertaken by resident aliens, citizens not liking it, on account of\r\nthe vexatious proceedings to which it often led. The farmer was armed\r\nwith considerable powers: he carried with him his books, searched\r\nfor contraband or uncustomed goods, watched the harbour, markets,\r\nand other places, to prevent smuggling, or unlawful and clandestine\r\nsales; brought a _phasis_ (φάσις) or other legal process against\r\nthose whom he suspected of defrauding the revenue; or even seized\r\ntheir persons on some occasions, and took them before the magistrate.\r\nTo enable him to perform these duties, he was exempted from military\r\nservice. Collectors (ἐκλογεῖς) were sometimes employed by the\r\nfarmers; but frequently the farmer and the collector were the same\r\nperson. The taxes were let by the commissioners (πωλῆται), acting\r\nunder the authority of the senate. The payments were made by the\r\nfarmer on stated prytaneias in the senate-house. There was usually\r\none payment made in advance, προκαταβολή, and one or more afterwards,\r\ncalled προσκατάβλημα. Upon any default of payment, the farmer became\r\n_atimus_, if a citizen, and he was liable to be imprisoned at the\r\ndiscretion of the court, upon an information laid against him. If the\r\ndebt was not paid by the expiration of the ninth prytaneia, it was\r\ndoubled; and if not then paid, his property became forfeited to the\r\nstate, and proceedings to confiscation might be taken forthwith. Upon\r\nthis subject, see the speech of Demosthenes against Timocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĔLOS (τέλος), a tax. The taxes imposed by the Athenians, and\r\ncollected at home, were either ordinary or extraordinary. The\r\nformer constituted a regular or permanent source of income; the\r\nlatter were only raised in time of war or other emergency. The\r\nordinary taxes were laid mostly upon _property_, and upon citizens\r\n_indirectly_, in the shape of toll or customs; though the resident\r\naliens paid a poll-tax (called μετοίκιον), for the liberty of\r\nresiding at Athens under protection of the state. There was a duty\r\nof two per cent. (πεντηκοστή), levied upon all exports and imports.\r\nAn excise was paid on all sales in the market (called ἐπωνία),\r\nthough we know not what the amount was. Slave-owners paid a duty\r\nof three obols for every slave they kept; and slaves who had been\r\nemancipated paid the same. This was a very productive tax before\r\nthe fortification of Deceleia by the Lacedaemonians. The justice\r\nfees (πρυτανεῖα, παραστασις, &c.) were a lucrative tax in time\r\nof peace. The extraordinary taxes were the property-tax, and the\r\ncompulsory services called _liturgies_ (λειτουργίαι). Some of these\r\nlast were regular, and recurred annually; the most important, the\r\n_trierarchia_, was a war-service, and performed as occasion required.\r\nAs these services were all performed, wholly or partly, at the\r\nexpense of the individual, they may be regarded as a species of tax.\r\n[EISPHORA; LEITOURGIA; TRIERARCHIA.] The tribute (φόρος) paid by the\r\nallied states to the Athenians formed, in the flourishing period of\r\nthe republic, a regular and most important source of revenue. In\r\nOlymp. 91 2, the Athenians substituted for the tribute a duty of\r\nfive per cent. (εἰκοστή) on all commodities exported or imported by\r\nthe subject states, thinking to raise by this means a larger income\r\nthan by direct taxation. This was terminated by the issue of the\r\nPeloponnesian war, though the tribute was afterwards revived, on more\r\nequitable principles, under the name of σύνταξις. Other sources of\r\nrevenue were derived by the Athenians from their mines and public\r\nlands, fines, and confiscations. The public demesne lands, whether\r\npasture or arable, houses or other buildings, were usually let by\r\nauction to private persons. The conditions of the lease were engraven\r\non stone. The rent was payable by prytaneias. These various sources\r\nof revenue produced, according to Aristophanes, an annual income\r\nof two thousand talents in the most flourishing period of Athenian\r\nempire. Τελεῖν signifies “to settle, complete, or perfect,” and hence\r\n“to settle an account,” and generally “to pay.” Thus Τέλος comes\r\nto mean any payment in the nature of a tax or duty. The words are\r\nconnected with _zahlen_ in German, and the old sense of _tale_ in\r\nEnglish, and the modern word _toll_. Though τέλος may signify any\r\npayment in the nature of a tax or duty, it is more commonly used of\r\nthe ordinary taxes, as customs, &c. Ἰσοτέλεια signifies the right of\r\nbeing taxed on the same footing, and having other privileges, the\r\nsame as the citizens; a right sometimes granted to resident aliens.\r\nἈτέλεια signifies an exemption from taxes, or other duties and\r\nservices; an honour very rarely granted by the Athenians. As to the\r\nfarming of the taxes, see TELONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLUM is the same word as the Greek _Temenos_ (τέμενος, from τέμνω,\r\nto cut off); for _templum_ was any place which was circumscribed\r\nand separated by the augurs from the rest of the land by a certain\r\nsolemn formula. The technical terms for this act of the augurs are\r\n_liberare_ and _effari_, and hence a templum itself is a _locus\r\nliberatus et effatus_. A place thus set apart and hallowed by the\r\naugurs was always intended to serve religious purposes, but chiefly\r\nfor taking the auguries. The place in the heavens within which the\r\nobservations were to be made was likewise called templum, as it was\r\nmarked out and separated from the rest by the staff of the augur.\r\nWhen the augur had defined the templum within which he intended\r\nto make his observations, he fixed his tent in it (_tabernaculum\r\ncapere_), and this tent was likewise called _templum_, or, more\r\naccurately, _templum minus_. The place chosen for a templum was\r\ngenerally an eminence, and in the city it was the _arx_, where the\r\nfixing of a tent does not appear to have been necessary, because here\r\na place called _auguraculum_ was once for all consecrated for this\r\npurpose. Besides this meaning of the word templum in the language of\r\nthe augurs, it also had that of a temple in the common acceptation.\r\nIn this case, however, the sacred precinct within which a temple\r\nwas built, was always a _locus liberatus et effatus_ by the augurs,\r\nthat is, a _templum_ or a _fanum_; the consecration was completed\r\nby the pontiffs, and not until inauguration and consecration had\r\ntaken place, could sacra be performed or meetings of the senate be\r\nheld in it. It was necessary then for a temple to be sanctioned\r\nby the gods, whose will was ascertained by the augurs, and to be\r\nconsecrated or dedicated by the will of man (pontiffs). Where the\r\nsanction of the gods had not been obtained, and where the mere act\r\nof man had consecrated a place to the gods, such a place was only\r\na _sacrum_, _sacrarium_, or _sacellum_. The ceremony performed\r\nby the augurs was essential to a temple, as the consecration by\r\nthe pontiffs took place also in other sanctuaries which were not\r\ntempla, but mere _sacra_ or _aedes sacrae_. Thus the sanctuary of\r\nVesta was not a templum, but an aedes sacra, and the various curiae\r\n(Hostilia, Pompeia, Julia) required to be made templa by the augurs\r\nbefore senatusconsulta could be made in them. It is impossible to\r\ndetermine with certainty in what respects a templum differed from\r\na _delubrum_.--Temples appear to have existed in Greece from the\r\nearliest times. They were separated from the profane land around them\r\n(τόπος βέβηλος or τὰ βέβηλα), because every one was allowed to walk\r\nin the latter. This separation was in early times indicated by very\r\nsimple means, such as a string or a rope. Subsequently, however,\r\nthey were surrounded by more efficient fences, or even by a wall\r\n(ἕρκος, περίβολος). The whole space enclosed in such a περίβολος\r\nwas called τέμενος, or sometimes ἱερόν; and contained, besides the\r\ntemple itself, other sacred buildings, and sacred ground planted with\r\ngroves, &c. Within the precincts of the sacred enclosure no dead were\r\ngenerally allowed to be buried, though there were some exceptions\r\nto this rule, and we have instances of persons being buried in or\r\nat least near certain temples. The religious laws of the island of\r\nDelos did not allow any corpses to be buried within the whole extent\r\nof the island, and when this law had been violated, a part of the\r\nisland was first purified by Pisistratus, and subsequently the whole\r\nisland by the Athenian people. The temple itself was called ναός\r\nor νεώς, and at its entrance fonts (περιῤῥαντήρια) were generally\r\nplaced, that those who entered the sanctuary to pray or to offer\r\nsacrifices might first purify themselves. The act of consecration,\r\nby which a temple was dedicated to a god, was called ἵδρυσις. The\r\ncharacter of the early Greek temples was dark and mysterious, for\r\nthey had no windows, and they received light only through the door,\r\nwhich was very large, or from lamps burning in them. Architecture\r\nin the construction of magnificent temples, however, made great\r\nprogress even at an earlier time than either painting or statuary,\r\nand long before the Persian wars we hear of temples of extraordinary\r\ngrandeur and beauty. All temples were built either in an oblong or\r\nround form, and were mostly adorned with columns. Those of an oblong\r\nform had columns either in the front alone, in the fore and back\r\nfronts, or on all the four sides. Respecting the original use of\r\nthese porticoes see PORTICUS. The friezes and metopes were adorned\r\nwith various sculptures, and no expense was spared in embellishing\r\nthe abodes of the gods. The light, which was formerly let in at the\r\ndoor, was now frequently let in from above through an opening in the\r\nmiddle. Most of the great temples consisted of three parts: 1. the\r\nπρόναος or πρόδομος, the vestibule; 2. the cella (ναός, σηκός); and\r\n3. the ὀπισθόδομος. The cella was the most important part, as it was,\r\nproperly speaking, the temple or the habitation of the deity whose\r\nstatue it contained. In one and the same cella there were sometimes\r\nthe statues of two or more divinities, as in the Erechtheum at\r\nAthens, the statues of Poseidon, Hephaestus, and Butas. The statues\r\nalways faced the entrance, which was in the centre of the prostylus.\r\nThe place where the statue stood was called ἕδος, and was surrounded\r\nby a balustrade or railings. Some temples also had more than one\r\ncella, in which case the one was generally behind the other, as in\r\nthe temple of Athena Polias at Athens. In temples where oracles\r\nwere given, or where the worship was connected with mysteries, the\r\ncella was called ἄδυτον, μέγαρον, or ἀνάκτορον, and to it only the\r\npriests and the initiated had access. The ὀπισθόδομος was a building\r\nwhich was sometimes attached to the back front of a temple, and\r\nserved as a place in which the treasures of the temple were kept,\r\nand thus supplied the place of θησαυροί, which were attached to some\r\ntemples.--_Quadrangular Temples_ were described by the following\r\nterms, according to the number and arrangement of the columns on\r\nthe fronts and sides. 1. Ἄστυλος, _astyle_, without any columns.\r\n2. Ἐν παραστάσι, _in antis_, with two columns in front between the\r\nantae. 3. Πρόστυλος, _prostyle_, with four columns in front. 4.\r\nἈμφιπρόστυλος, _amphiprostyle_, with four columns at each end. 5.\r\nΠερίπτερος or ἀμφικίων, _peripteral_, with columns at each end and\r\nalong each side. 6. Δίπτερος, _dipteral_, with two ranges of columns\r\n(πτερά) all round, the one within the other. 7. Ψευδοδίπτερος,\r\n_pseudodipteral_, with one range only, but at the same distance\r\nfrom the walls of the _cella_ as the outer range of a δίπτερος. To\r\nthese must be added a sort of sham invented by the Roman architects,\r\nnamely: 8. Ψευδοπερίπτερος, _pseudoperipteral_, where the sides had\r\nonly half-columns (at the angles three-quarter columns), attached to\r\nthe walls of the _cella_, the object being to have the _cella_ large\r\nwithout enlarging the whole building, and yet to keep up something\r\nof the splendour of a peripteral temple. Names were also applied to\r\nthe temples, as well as to the porticoes themselves, according to\r\nthe number of columns in the portico at either end of the temple:\r\nnamely, τετράστυλος, _tetrastyle_, when there were _four_ columns in\r\nfront, ἑξάστυλος, _hexastyle_, when there were _six_, ὀκτάστυλος,\r\n_octastyle_, when there were _eight_, δεκάστυλος, _decastyle_, when\r\nthere were _ten_. There were never more than ten columns in the end\r\nportico of a temple; and when there were only two, they were always\r\narranged in that peculiar form called _in antis_ (ἐν παραστάσι).\r\nThe number of columns in the end porticoes was never uneven, but\r\nthe number along the sides of a temple was generally uneven. The\r\nnumber of the side columns varied: where the end portico was\r\ntetrastyle, there were never any columns at the sides, except false\r\nones, attached to the walls: where it was hexastyle or octastyle,\r\nthere were generally 13 or 17 columns at the sides, counting in\r\nthe corner columns: sometimes a hexastyle temple had only eleven\r\ncolumns on the sides. The last arrangement resulted from the rule\r\nadopted by the Roman architects, who counted by intercolumniations\r\n(the spaces between the columns), and whose rule was to have _twice\r\nas many intercolumniations along the sides of the building as in\r\nfront_. The Greek architects on the contrary, counted by columns,\r\nand their rule was to have _twice as many columns along the sides\r\nas in front, and one more_, counting the corner columns in each\r\ncase. Another set of terms, applied to temples and other buildings\r\nhaving porticoes, as well as to the porticoes themselves, was derived\r\nfrom the distances between the columns as compared with the lower\r\ndiameters of the columns. They were the following:--1. Πυκνόστυλος,\r\n_pycnostyle_, the distance between the columns a diameter of a column\r\nand half a diameter. 2. Σύστυλος, _systyle_, the distance between\r\nthe columns two diameters of a column. 3. Εὔστυλος, _eustyle_, the\r\ndistance between the columns two diameters and a quarter, except\r\nin the centre of the front and back of the building, where each\r\nintercolumniation (_intercolumnium_) was three diameters; called\r\neustyle, because it was best adapted both for beauty and convenience.\r\n4. Διάστυλος, _diastyle_, the intercolumniation, or distance between\r\nthe columns, three diameters. 5. Ἀραιόστυλος, _araeostyle_, the\r\ndistances excessive, so that it was necessary to make the epistyle\r\n(ἐπιστύλιον), or architrave, not of stone, but of timber. These five\r\nkinds of intercolumniation are illustrated by the following diagram.\r\n\r\n      ⬤   1½  ⬤\r\n     ⬤    2    ⬤\r\n    ⬤     2¼    ⬤\r\n   ⬤      3      ⬤\r\n  ⬤   {   4   }   ⬤\r\n      {or more }\r\n\r\nIndependently of the immense treasures contained in many of the\r\nGreek temples, which were either utensils or ornaments, and of\r\nthe tithes of spoils, &c., the property of temples, from which\r\nthey derived a regular income, consisted of lands (τεμένη), either\r\nfields, pastures, or forests. These lands were generally let out to\r\nfarm, unless they were, by some curse which lay on them, prevented\r\nfrom being taken into cultivation. Respecting the persons entrusted\r\nwith the superintendence, keeping, cleaning, &c., see AEDITUI. In\r\nthe earliest times there appear to have been very few temples at\r\nRome, and on many spots the worship of a certain divinity had been\r\nestablished from time immemorial, while we hear of the building of\r\na temple for the same divinity at a comparatively late period. Thus\r\nthe foundation of a temple to the old Italian divinity Saturnus, on\r\nthe Capitoline, did not take place till B.C. 498. In the same manner,\r\nQuirinus and Mars had temples built to them at a late period. Jupiter\r\nalso had no temple till the time of Ancus Martius, and the one then\r\nbuilt was certainly very insignificant. We may therefore suppose\r\nthat the places of worship among the earliest Romans were in most\r\ncases simple altars or sacella. The Roman temples of later times were\r\nconstructed in the Greek style. As regards the property of temples,\r\nit is stated that in early times lands were assigned to each temple,\r\nbut these lands were probably intended for the maintenance of the\r\npriests alone. [SACERDOS.] The supreme superintendence of the temples\r\nof Rome, and of all things connected with them, belonged to the\r\ncollege of pontiffs. Those persons who had the immediate care of the\r\ntemples were the AEDITUI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĔPĬDĀRĬUM. [BALNEUM, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMĬNĀLĬA, a festival in honour of the god Terminus, who presided\r\nover boundaries. His statue was merely a stone or post stuck in the\r\nground to distinguish between properties. On the festival the two\r\nowners of adjacent property crowned the statue with garlands, and\r\nraised a rude altar, on which they offered up some corn, honeycombs,\r\nand wine, and sacrificed a lamb or a sucking-pig. They concluded with\r\nsinging the praises of the god. The public festival in honour of\r\nthis god was celebrated at the sixth mile-stone on the road towards\r\nLaurentum, doubtless because this was originally the extent of the\r\nRoman territory in that direction. The festival of the Terminalia was\r\ncelebrated on the 23rd of February, on the day before the Regifugium.\r\nThe Terminalia was celebrated on the last day of the old Roman\r\nyear, whence some derive its name. We know that February was the\r\nlast month of the Roman year, and that when the intercalary month\r\nMercedonius was added, the last five days of February were added to\r\nthe intercalary month, making the 23rd of February the last day of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĔRUNCĬUS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTESSĔRA (κύβος), a square or cube; a die; a token. The dice used\r\nin games of chance were tesserae, small squares or cubes, and were\r\ncommonly made of ivory, bone, or wood. They were numbered on all\r\nthe six sides, like the dice still in use; and in this respect\r\nas well as in their form they differed from the _tali_. [TALUS.]\r\nWhilst four tali were used in playing, only three tesserae were\r\nanciently employed. Objects of the same materials with dice, and\r\neither formed like them, or of an oblong shape, were used as tokens\r\nfor different purposes. The _tessera hospitalis_ was the token of\r\nmutual hospitality, and is spoken of under HOSPITIUM. This token was\r\nprobably in many cases of earthenware, having the head of Jupiter\r\nHospitalis stamped upon it. _Tesserae frumentariae_ and _nummariae_\r\nwere tokens given at certain times by the Roman magistrates to the\r\npoor, in exchange for which they received a fixed amount of corn or\r\nmoney. From the application of this term to tokens of various kinds,\r\nit was transferred to _the word_ used as a token among soldiers.\r\nThis was the _tessera militaris_, the σύνθημα of the Greeks. Before\r\njoining battle it was given out and passed through the ranks, as a\r\nmethod by which the soldiers might be able to distinguish friends\r\nfrom foes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTĀMENTUM, a will. In order to be able to make a valid Roman will,\r\nthe Testator must have the Testamentifactio, which term expresses\r\nthe legal capacity to make a valid will. The testamentifactio was\r\nthe privilege only of Roman citizens who were patresfamilias. The\r\nfollowing persons consequently had not the testamentifactio: those\r\nwho were in the Potestas or Manus of another, or in Mancipii causa,\r\nas sons and daughters, wives In manu and slaves: Latini Juniani,\r\nDediticii: Peregrini could not dispose of their property according\r\nto the form of a Roman will: an Impubes could not dispose of his\r\nproperty by will even with the consent of his Tutor; when a male was\r\nfourteen years of age, he obtained the testamentifactio, and a female\r\nobtained the power, subject to certain restraints, on the completion\r\nof her twelfth year: muti, surdi, furiosi, and prodigi “quibus lege\r\nbonis interdictum est” had not the testamentifactio. In order to\r\nconstitute a valid will, it was necessary that a heres should be\r\ninstituted, which might be done in such terms as follow:--Titius\r\nheres esto, Titium heredem esse jubeo. [HERES (ROMAN.)] Originally\r\nthere were two modes of making wills; either at Calata Comitia, which\r\nwere appointed twice a year for that purpose; or _in procinctu_, that\r\nis, when a man was going to battle. A third mode of making wills was\r\nintroduced, which was effected _per aes et libram_, whence the name\r\nof Testamentum per aes et libram. If a man had neither made his will\r\nat Calata Comitia nor In procinctu, and was in imminent danger of\r\ndeath, he would mancipate (_mancipio dabat_) his Familia, that is,\r\nhis Patrimonium to a friend and would tell him what he wished to\r\nbe given to each after his death. There seems to have been no rule\r\nof law that a testament must be written. The heres might either be\r\nmade by oral declaration (_nuncupatio_) or by writing. Written wills\r\nhowever were the common form among the Romans at least in the later\r\nrepublican and in the imperial periods. They were written on tablets\r\nof wood or wax, whence the word “cera” is often used as equivalent to\r\n“tabella;” and the expressions prima, secunda cera are equivalent to\r\nprima, secunda pagina. The will must have been in some way so marked\r\nas to be recognized, and the practice of the witnesses (_testes_)\r\nsealing and signing the will at last became common. It was necessary\r\nfor the witnesses both to seal (_signare_), that is, to make a mark\r\nwith a ring (_annulus_) or something else on the wax and to add their\r\nnames (_adscribere_). Wills were to be tied with a triple thread\r\n(_linum_) on the upper part of the margin which was to be perforated\r\nat the middle part, and the wax was to be put over the thread and\r\nsealed. Tabulae which were produced in any other way had no validity.\r\nA man might make several copies of his will, which was often done for\r\nthe sake of caution. When sealed, it was deposited with some friend,\r\nor in a temple, or with the Vestal Virgins; and after the testator’s\r\ndeath it was opened (_resignare_) in due form. The witnesses or the\r\nmajor part were present, and after they had acknowledged their seals,\r\nthe thread (_linum_) was broken and the will was opened and read, and\r\na copy was made; the original was then sealed with the public seal\r\nand placed in the archium, whence a fresh copy might be got, if the\r\nfirst copy should ever be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIS, a witness.--(1) GREEK. [MARTYRIA.]--(2) ROMAN. [JUSJURANDUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTŪDO (χελώνη), a tortoise, was the name given to several other\r\nobjects.--(1) To the Lyra, because it was sometimes made of a\r\ntortoise-shell.--(2) To an arched or vaulted roof.--(3) To a military\r\nmachine moving upon wheels and roofed over, used in besieging\r\ncities, under which the soldiers worked in undermining the walls\r\nor otherwise destroying them. It was usually covered with raw\r\nhides, or other materials which could not easily be set on fire.\r\nThe battering-ram [ARIES] was frequently placed under a testudo of\r\nthis kind, which was then called _Testudo Arietaria_.--(4) The name\r\nof testudo was also applied to the covering made by a close body\r\nof soldiers who placed their shields over their heads to secure\r\nthemselves against the darts of the enemy. The shields fitted so\r\nclosely together as to present one unbroken surface without any\r\ninterstices between them, and were also so firm that men could walk\r\nupon them, and even horses and chariots be driven over them. A\r\ntestudo was formed (_testudinem facere_) either in battle to ward\r\noff the arrows and other missiles of the enemy, or, which was more\r\nfrequently the case, to form a protection to the soldiers when they\r\nadvanced to the walls or gates of a town for the purpose of attacking\r\nthem. Sometimes the shields were disposed in such a way as to make\r\nthe testudo slope. The soldiers in the first line stood upright,\r\nthose in the second stooped a little, and each line successively\r\nwas a little lower than the preceding down to the last, where the\r\nsoldiers rested on one knee. Such a disposition of the shields was\r\ncalled _fastigata testudo_, on account of their sloping like the roof\r\nof a building. The advantages of this plan were obvious: the stones\r\nand missiles thrown upon the shields rolled off them like water from\r\na roof; besides which, other soldiers frequently advanced upon them\r\nto attack the enemy upon the walls. The Romans were accustomed to\r\nform this kind of testudo, as an exercise, in the games of the circus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Testudo. (From the Antonine Column.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĔTRARCHĒS or TĔTRARCHA (τετράρχης). This word was originally used,\r\naccording to its etymological meaning, to signify the governor of\r\nthe fourth part of a country (τετραρχία or τετραδαρχία). We have an\r\nexample in the ancient division of Thessaly into four tetrarchies,\r\nwhich was revived by Philip. Each of the three Gallic tribes which\r\nsettled in Galatia was divided into four tetrarchies, each ruled by\r\na tetrarch. Some of the tribes of Syria were ruled by tetrarchs, and\r\nseveral of the princes of the house of Herod ruled in Palestine with\r\nthis title. In the later period of the republic and under the empire,\r\nthe Romans seem to have used the title (as also those of _ethnarch_\r\nand _phylarch_) to designate those tributary princes who were not of\r\nsufficient importance to be called kings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTETTĂRĂKONTA, HOI (οἱ τετταράκοντα), _the Forty_, were certain\r\nofficers chosen by lot, who made regular circuits through the demi of\r\nAttica, whence they are called δικασταὶ κατὰ δήμους, to decide all\r\ncases of αἰκία and τὰ περὶ τῶν βιαίων, and also all other private\r\ncauses, where the matter in dispute was not above the value of ten\r\ndrachmae. Their number was originally thirty, but was increased to\r\nforty after the expulsion of the thirty tyrants, and the restoration\r\nof the democracy by Thrasybulus, in consequence, it is said, of the\r\nhatred of the Athenians to the number of thirty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHARGĒLĬA (θαργήλια), a festival celebrated at Athens on the 6th\r\nand 7th of Thargelion, in honour of Apollo and Artemis. The real\r\nfestival, or the Thargelia in a narrower sense of the word, appears\r\nto have taken place on the 7th; and on the preceding day, the city\r\nof Athens or rather its inhabitants were purified. The manner in\r\nwhich this purification was effected is very extraordinary, and is\r\ncertainly a remnant of very ancient rites, for two persons were\r\nput to death on that day, and the one died on behalf of the men\r\nand the other on behalf of the women of Athens. The name by which\r\nthese victims were designated was _pharmaci_ (φαρμακοί). It appears\r\nprobable, however, that this sacrifice did not take place annually,\r\nbut only in case of a heavy calamity having befallen the city,\r\nsuch as the plague, a famine, &c. The victims appear to have been\r\ncriminals sentenced to death. The second day of the thargelia was\r\nsolemnized with a procession and an agon, which consisted of a cyclic\r\nchorus, performed by men at the expense of a choragus. The prize of\r\nthe victor in this agon was a tripod, which he had to dedicate in\r\nthe temple of Apollo which had been built by Pisistratus. On this\r\nday it was customary for persons who were adopted into a family to\r\nbe solemnly registered, and received into the genos and the phratria\r\nof the adoptive parents. This solemnity was the same as that of\r\nregistering one’s own children at the Apaturia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Greek Theatre.]\r\n\r\nTHĔĀTRUM (θέατρον), a theatre. The Athenians before the time of\r\nAeschylus had only a wooden scaffolding on which their dramas were\r\nperformed. Such a wooden theatre was only erected for the time of\r\nthe Dionysiac festivals, and was afterwards pulled down. The first\r\ndrama that Aeschylus brought upon the stage was performed upon such\r\na wooden scaffold, and it is recorded as a singular and ominous\r\ncoincidence that on that occasion (500 B.C.) the scaffolding broke\r\ndown. To prevent the recurrence of such an accident, the building\r\nof a stone theatre was forthwith commenced on the south-eastern\r\ndescent of the Acropolis, in the Lenaea; for it should be observed,\r\nthat throughout Greece theatres were always built upon eminences, or\r\non the sloping side of a hill. The new Athenian theatre was built\r\non a very large scale, and appears to have been constructed with\r\ngreat skill in regard to its acoustic and perspective arrangements.\r\nSubsequently theatres were erected in all parts of Greece and Asia\r\nMinor, although Athens was the centre of the Greek drama, and the\r\nonly place which produced great masterworks in this department\r\nof literature. All the theatres, however, which were constructed\r\nin Greece were probably built after the model of that of Athens,\r\nand, with slight deviations and modifications, they all resembled\r\none another in the main points, as is seen in the numerous ruins\r\nof theatres in various parts of Greece, Asia Minor, and Sicily.\r\nThe Attic theatre was, like all the Greek theatres, placed in\r\nsuch a manner that the place for the spectators formed the upper\r\nor north-western, and the stage with all that belonged to it the\r\nsouth-eastern part, and between these two parts lay the orchestra.\r\nThe annexed plan has been made from the remains of Greek theatres\r\nstill extant, and from a careful examination of the passages in\r\nancient writers which describe the whole or parts of a theatre.--1.\r\nThe place for the spectators was in a narrower sense of the word\r\ncalled _theatrum_. The seats for the spectators, which were in\r\nmost cases cut out of the rock, consisted of rows of benches rising\r\none above another; the rows themselves (_a_) formed parts (nearly\r\nthree-fourths) of concentric circles, and were at intervals divided\r\ninto compartments by one or more broad passages (_b_) running\r\nbetween them, and parallel with the benches. These passages were\r\ncalled διαζώματα, or κατατομαί, Lat. _praecinctiones_, and when\r\nthe concourse of people was very great in a theatre, many persons\r\nmight stand in them. Across the rows of benches ran stairs, by which\r\npersons might ascend from the lowest to the highest. But these stairs\r\nran in straight lines only from one praecinctio to another; and the\r\nstairs in the next series of rows were just between the two stairs of\r\nthe lower series of benches. By this course of the stairs the seats\r\nwere divided into a number of compartments, resembling cones from\r\nwhich the tops are cut off; hence they were termed κεοκίδες, and in\r\nLatin _cunei_. The whole of the place for the spectators (θέατρον)\r\nwas sometimes designated by the name κοῖλον, Latin _cavea_, it being\r\nin most cases a real excavation of the rock. Above the highest row\r\nof benches there rose a covered portico (_c_), which of course far\r\nexceeded in height the opposite buildings by which the stage was\r\nsurrounded, and appears to have also contributed to increase the\r\nacoustic effect. The entrances to the seats of the spectators were\r\npartly underground, and led to the lowest rows of benches, while the\r\nupper rows must have been accessible from above.--2. The orchestra\r\n(ὀρχήστρα) was a circular level space extending in front of the\r\nspectators, and somewhat below the lowest row of benches. But it was\r\nnot a complete circle, one segment of it being appropriated to the\r\nstage. The orchestra was the place for the chorus, where it performed\r\nits evolutions and dances, for which purpose it was covered with\r\nboards. As the chorus was the element out of which the drama arose,\r\nso the orchestra was originally the most important part of a theatre:\r\nit formed the centre around which all the other parts of the building\r\nwere grouped. In the centre of the circle of the orchestra was the\r\n_thymele_ (θυμέλη), that is, the altar of Dionysus (_d_), which was\r\nof coarse nearer to the stage than to the seats of the spectators,\r\nthe distance from which was precisely the length of a radius of the\r\ncircle. In a wider sense the orchestra also comprised the broad\r\npassages (πάροδοι, _e_) on each side, between the projecting wings of\r\nthe stage and the seats of the spectators, through which the chorus\r\nentered the orchestra. The chorus generally arranged itself in the\r\nspace between the thymele and the stage. The thymele itself was of\r\na square form, and was used for various purposes, according to the\r\nnature of the different plays, such as a funeral monument, an altar,\r\n&c. It was made of boards, and surrounded on all sides with steps.\r\nIt thus stood upon a raised platform, which was sometimes occupied\r\nby the leader of the chorus, the flute-player, and the rhabdophori.\r\nThe orchestra as well as the _theatrum_ lay under the open sky; a\r\nroof is nowhere mentioned.--3. The stage. Steps led from each side\r\nof the orchestra to the stage, and by them the chorus probably\r\nascended the stage whenever it took a real part in the action itself.\r\nThe back side of the stage was closed by a wall called the _scena_\r\n(σκηνή), from which on each side a wing projected which was called\r\nthe _parascenium_ (παρασκήνιον). The whole depth of the stage was\r\nnot very great, as it only comprised a segment of the circle of the\r\norchestra. The whole space from the scena to the orchestra was termed\r\nthe _proscenium_ (προσκήνιον), and was what we should call the real\r\nstage. That part of it which was nearest to the orchestra, and where\r\nthe actors stood when they spoke, was the _logeium_ (λογείον), also\r\ncalled _ocribas_ (ὀκρίβας), in Latin _pulpitum_, which was of course\r\nraised above the orchestra, and probably on a level with the thymele.\r\nThe _scena_ was, as we have already stated, the wall which closed\r\nthe stage (_proscenium_ and _logeium_) from behind. It represented a\r\nsuitable background, or the locality in which the action was going\r\non. Before the play began it was covered with a curtain (παραπέτασμα,\r\nπροσκήνιον, αὐλαίαι), Latin _aulaea_ or _siparium_. When the play\r\nbegan this curtain was let down, and was rolled up on a roller\r\nunderneath the stage. The proscenium and logeium were never concealed\r\nfrom the spectators. As regards the scenery represented on the\r\n_scena_, it was different for tragedy, comedy, and the satyric drama,\r\nand for each of these kinds of poetry the scenery must have been\r\ncapable of various modifications, according to the character of each\r\nindividual play; at least that this was the case with the various\r\ntragedies, is evident from the scenes described in the tragedies\r\nstill extant. In the latter however the back-ground (_scena_) in\r\nmost cases represented the front of a palace with a door in the\r\ncentre (_i_) which was called the _royal door_. This palace generally\r\nconsisted of two stories, and upon its flat roof there appears to\r\nhave been some elevated place from which persons might observe\r\nwhat was going on at a distance. The palace presented on each side\r\na projecting wing, each of which had its separate entrance. These\r\nwings generally represented the habitations of guests and visitors.\r\nAll the three doors must have been visible to the spectators. The\r\nprotagonistes always entered the stage through the middle or royal\r\ndoor, the deuteragonistes and tritagonistes through those on the\r\nright and left wings. In tragedies like the Prometheus, the Persians,\r\nPhiloctetes, Oedipus in Colonus, and others, the back-ground did\r\nnot represent a palace. There are other pieces again in which the\r\nscena must have been changed in the course of the performance, as in\r\nthe Eumenides of Aeschylus and the Ajax of Sophocles. The dramas of\r\nEuripides required a great variety of scenery; and if in addition\r\nto this we recollect that several pieces were played in one day,\r\nit is manifest that the mechanical parts of stage performance, at\r\nleast in the days of Euripides, must have been brought to great\r\nperfection. The scena in the satyric drama appears to have always\r\nrepresented a woody district with hills and grottos; in comedy the\r\nscena represented, at least in later times, the fronts of private\r\ndwellings or the habitations of slaves. The art of scene-painting\r\nmust have been applied long before the time of Sophocles, although\r\nAristotle ascribes its introduction to him. The whole of the cavea\r\nin the Attic theatre must have contained about 50,000 spectators.\r\nThe places for generals, the archons, priests, foreign ambassadors,\r\nand other distinguished persons, were in the lowest rows of benches,\r\nand nearest to the orchestra, and they appear to have been sometimes\r\ncovered with a sort of canopy. The rows of benches above these were\r\noccupied by the senate of 500, those next in succession by the\r\nephebi, and the rest by the people of Athens. But it would seem that\r\nthey did not sit indiscriminately, but that the better places were\r\nlet at a higher price than the others, and that no one had a right to\r\ntake a place for which he had not paid. The usual fee for a place was\r\ntwo obols, which was subsequently given to the poorer classes by a\r\nlaw of Pericles. [THEORICA.] Women were allowed to be present during\r\nthe performance of tragedies, but not of comedies.--The Romans must\r\nhave become acquainted with the theatres of the Italian Greeks at\r\nan early period, whence they erected their own theatres in similar\r\npositions upon the sides of hills. This is still clear from the\r\nruins of very ancient theatres at Tusculum and Faesulae. The Romans\r\nthemselves, however, did not possess a regular stone theatre until\r\na very late period, and although dramatic representations were very\r\npopular in earlier times, it appears that a wooden stage was erected\r\nwhen necessary, and was afterwards pulled down again, and the plays\r\nof Plautus and Terence were performed on such temporary scaffoldings.\r\nIn the mean while, many of the neighbouring towns of Rome had their\r\nstone theatres, as the introduction of Greek customs and manners\r\nwas less strongly opposed in them than in the city of Rome itself.\r\nWooden theatres, adorned with the most profuse magnificence, were\r\nerected at Rome even during the last period of the republic. In\r\nB.C. 55 Cn. Pompey built the first stone theatre at Rome, near the\r\nCampus Martius. It was of great beauty, and is said to have been\r\nbuilt after the model of that of Mytilene; it contained 40,000\r\nspectators. The construction of a Roman theatre resembled, on the\r\nwhole, that of a Greek one. The principal differences are, that the\r\nseats of the spectators, which rose in the form of an amphitheatre\r\naround the orchestra, did not form more than a semicircle; and\r\nthat the whole of the orchestra likewise formed only a semicircle,\r\nthe diameter of which formed the front line of the stage. The Roman\r\norchestra contained no thymele, and was not destined for a chorus,\r\nbut contained the seats for senators and other distinguished persons,\r\nsuch as foreign ambassadors, which are called _primus subselliorum\r\nordo_. In B.C. 68 the tribune L. Roscius Otho carried a law which\r\nregulated the places in the theatre to be occupied by the different\r\nclasses of Roman citizens: it enacted that fourteen ordines of\r\nbenches were to be assigned as seats to the equites. Hence these\r\nquatuordecim ordines are sometimes mentioned without any further\r\naddition, as the honorary seats of the equites. They were undoubtedly\r\nclose behind the seats of the senators and magistrates, and thus\r\nconsisted of the rows of benches immediately behind the orchestra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Roman Theatre.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHENSAE or TENSAE, highly ornamented sacred vehicles, which, in the\r\nsolemn pomp of the Circensian games, conveyed the statues of certain\r\ndeities with all their decorations to the pulvinaria, and after the\r\nsports were over bore them back to their shrines. We are ignorant\r\nof their precise form. We know that they were drawn by horses, and\r\nescorted (_deducere_) by the chief senators in robes of state,\r\nwho, along with pueri patrimi [PATRIMI], laid hold of the bridles\r\nand traces, or perhaps assisted to drag the carriage by means of\r\nthongs attached for the purpose (and hence the proposed derivation\r\nfrom _tendo_). So sacred was this duty considered, that Augustus,\r\nwhen labouring under sickness, deemed it necessary to accompany the\r\ntensae in a litter. If one of the horses knocked up, or the driver\r\ntook the reins in his left hand, it was necessary to recommence the\r\nprocession, and for one of the attendant boys to let go the thong,\r\nor to stumble, was profanation. The only gods distinctly named as\r\ncarried in tensae are Jupiter and Minerva, though others appear to\r\nhave had the same honour paid them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHĔŎPHĂNĬA (θεοφάνια), a festival celebrated at Delphi, on the\r\noccasion of which the Delphians filled the huge silver crater which\r\nhad been presented to the Delphic god by Croesus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHĔŌRĬA. [THEORI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHĔŌRĬCA (θεωρικά). Under this name at Athens were comprised the\r\nmonies expended on festivals, sacrifices, and public entertainments\r\nof various kinds; and also monies distributed among the people in\r\nthe shape of largesses from the state. There were, according to\r\nXenophon, more festivals at Athens than in all the rest of Greece.\r\nAt the most important of the public festivals, such as the Dionysia,\r\nPanathenaea, Eleusinia, Thargelia, and some others, there were not\r\nonly sacrifices, but processions, theatrical exhibitions, gymnastic\r\ncontests, and games, celebrated with great splendour and at a great\r\nexpense. A portion of the expense was defrayed by the individuals\r\nupon whom the burden of the liturgies devolved; but a considerable,\r\nand perhaps the larger, part was defrayed by the public treasury.\r\nDemosthenes complains, that more money was spent on a single\r\nPanathenaic or Dionysiac festival than on any military expedition.\r\nThe religious embassies to Delos and other places, and especially\r\nthose to the Olympian, Nemean, Isthmian, and Pythian games, drew\r\nlargely upon the public exchequer, though a part of the cost fell\r\nupon the wealthier citizens who conducted them. The largesses\r\ndistributed among the people had their origin at an early period,\r\nand in a measure apparently harmless, though from a small beginning\r\nthey afterwards rose to a height most injurious to the commonwealth.\r\nThe Attic drama used to be performed in a wooden theatre, and the\r\nentrance was free to all citizens who chose to go. It was found,\r\nhowever, that the crushing to get in led to much confusion and even\r\ndanger. On one occasion, about B.C. 500, the wooden scaffolding of\r\nthe theatre fell down, and caused great alarm. It was then determined\r\nthat the entrance should no longer be gratuitous. The fee for a place\r\nwas fixed at two obols, which was paid to the lessee of the theatre,\r\n(called θεατρώνης, θεατροπώλης, or ἀρχιτέκτων), who undertook to\r\nkeep it in repair, and constantly ready for use, on condition of\r\nbeing allowed to receive the profits. This payment continued to be\r\nexacted after the stone theatre was built. Pericles, to relieve the\r\npoorer classes, passed a law which enabled them to receive the price\r\nof admission from the state; after which all those citizens who were\r\ntoo poor to pay for their places applied for the money in the public\r\nassembly, which was then frequently held in the theatre. In process\r\nof time this donation was extended to other entertainments besides\r\ntheatrical ones; the sum of two oboli being given to each citizen who\r\nattended; if the festival lasted two days, four oboli; and if three,\r\nsix oboli; but not beyond. Hence all theoric largesses received the\r\nname of _diobelia_ (διωβελία). It is calculated that from 25 to 30\r\ntalents were spent upon them annually. So large an expenditure of the\r\npublic funds upon shows and amusements absorbed the resources, which\r\nwere demanded for services of a more important nature. By the ancient\r\nlaw, the whole surplus of the annual revenue which remained after\r\nthe expense of the civil administration (τὰ περίοντα χρήματα τῆς\r\nδιοικήσεως) was to be carried to the military fund, and applied to\r\nthe defence of the commonwealth. Since the time of Pericles various\r\ndemagogues had sprung up, who induced the people to divert all that\r\ncould be spared from the other branches of civil expenditure into the\r\ntheoric fund, which at length swallowed up the whole surplus, and the\r\nsupplies needed for the purpose of war or defence were left to depend\r\nupon the extraordinary contributions, or property-tax (εἰσφοραί). An\r\nattempt was made by the demagogue Eubulus to perpetuate this system.\r\nHe passed a law, which made it a capital offence to propose that\r\nthe theoric fund should be applied to military service. The law of\r\nEubulus was a source of great embarrassment to Demosthenes, in the\r\nprosecution of his schemes for the national defence; and he seems at\r\nlast, but not before B.C. 339, to have succeeded in repealing it. In\r\nthe earlier times there was no person, or board of persons, expressly\r\nappointed to manage the theoric fund. The money thus appropriated\r\nwas disbursed by the Hellenotamiae. After the anarchy, the largess\r\nsystem having been restored by Agyrrhius, a board of managers was\r\nappointed. They were elected by show of hands at the period of the\r\ngreat Dionysia, one from each tribe.\r\n\r\nTHĔŌRI (θεωροί), persons sent on special missions (θεωρίαι) to\r\nperform some religious duty, as to consult an oracle, or to offer\r\na sacrifice, on behalf of the state. There were among some of the\r\nDorian states, as the Aeginetans, Troezenians, Messenians, and\r\nMantineans, official priests called _Theori_, whose duty it was to\r\nconsult oracles, interpret the responses, &c., as among the Spartans\r\nthere were men called _Pythii_, chosen by the kings to consult\r\nthe oracle at Delphi. At Athens there were no official persons\r\ncalled _Theori_, but the name was given to those citizens who were\r\nappointed from time to time to conduct religious embassies to various\r\nplaces; of which the most important were those that were sent to the\r\nOlympian, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games, those that went to\r\nconsult the God at Delphi, and those that led the solemn procession\r\nto Delos, where the Athenians established a quadriennial festival, in\r\nrevival of the ancient Ionian one, of which Homer speaks. The expense\r\nof these embassies was defrayed partly by the state, and partly by\r\nwealthy citizens, to whom the management of them was entrusted,\r\ncalled _Architheori_ (ἀρχιθέωροι), chiefs of the embassy. This was\r\na sort of liturgy, and frequently a very costly one; as the chief\r\nconductor represented the state, and was expected to appear with a\r\nsuitable degree of splendour; for instance, to wear a golden crown,\r\nto drive into the city with a handsome chariot, retinue, &c. The\r\nSalaminian, or Delian, ship was also called θεωρὶς ναῦς, and was\r\nprincipally used for conveying embassies to Delos, though, like the\r\nParalus, it was employed on other expeditions besides.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERMAE. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHĒSAURUS (θησαυρός), a treasure-house. Tradition points to\r\nsubterranean buildings in Greece, of unknown antiquity and of\r\npeculiar formation, as having been erected during the heroic period,\r\nfor the purpose of preserving precious metals, arms, and other\r\nproperty (κειμήλια). Such are the treasury of Minyas, at Orchomenus,\r\nof which some remains still exist, and those of Atreus and his\r\nsons at Mycenae, the chief one of which, the so-called Treasury of\r\nAtreus, still exists almost in a perfect state. It is, however,\r\nvery questionable whether these edifices were treasuries at all:\r\nsome of the best archaeologists maintain that they were tombs. In\r\nthe historical times, the public treasury was either in a building\r\nattached to the _agora_, or in the _opisthodomus_ of some temple.\r\nRespecting the public treasury at Rome, see AERARIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHĒSEIA (θησεῖα), a festival celebrated by the Athenians in honour\r\nof their national hero Theseus, whom they believed to have been the\r\nauthor of their democratical form of government. In consequence of\r\nthis belief donations of bread and meat were given to the poor people\r\nat the Theseia, which was thus for them a feast at which they felt no\r\nwant, and might fancy themselves equal to the wealthiest citizens.\r\nThe day on which this festival was held was the eighth of every\r\nmonth (ὀγδόαι), but more especially the eighth of Pyanepsion, whence\r\nthe festival was sometimes called ὀγδόδιον. It is probable that the\r\nfestival of the Theseia was not instituted till B.C. 469, when Cimon\r\nbrought the remains of Theseus from Scyrus to Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESMŎPHŎRĬA (θεσμοφόρια), a great festival and mysteries, celebrated\r\nin honour of Demeter in various parts of Greece, and only by women,\r\nthough some ceremonies were also performed by maidens. It was\r\nintended to commemorate the introduction of the laws and regulations\r\nof civilised life, which was universally ascribed to Demeter. The\r\nAttic thesmophoria probably lasted only three days, and began on\r\nthe 11th of Pyanepsion, which day was called ἄνοδος or κάθοδος,\r\nbecause the solemnities were opened by the women with a procession\r\nfrom Athens to Eleusis. In this procession they carried on their\r\nheads sacred laws (νόμιμοι βίβλοι or θεσμοί), the introduction of\r\nwhich was ascribed to Demeter (Θεσμοφόρος), and other symbols of\r\ncivilised life. The women spent the night at Eleusis in celebrating\r\nthe mysteries of the goddess. The second day, called νηστεία, was a\r\nday of mourning, during which the women sat on the ground around the\r\nstatue of Demeter, and took no other food than cakes made of sesame\r\nand honey. On this day no meetings either of the senate or the people\r\nwere held. It was probably in the afternoon of this day that the\r\nwomen held a procession at Athens, in which they walked barefooted\r\nbehind a waggon, upon which baskets with mystical symbols were\r\nconveyed to the thesmophorion. The third day, called καλλιγένεια,\r\nfrom the circumstance that Demeter was invoked under this name,\r\nwas a day of merriment and raillery among the women themselves, in\r\ncommemoration of Iambe, who was said to have made the goddess smile\r\nduring her grief.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESMŎTHĔTAE. [ARCHON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHĒTES. [CENSUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOLOS (θόλος, also called σκιάς), a name given to any round building\r\nwhich terminated at the top in a point, whatever might be the purpose\r\nfor which it was used. At Athens the name was in particular applied\r\nto the new round prytaneium near the senate-house, which should not\r\nbe confounded with the old prytaneium at the foot of the acropolis.\r\nIt was therefore the place in which the prytanes took their common\r\nmeals and offered their sacrifices. It was adorned with some small\r\nsilver statues, and near it stood the ten statues of the Attic\r\nEponymi.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHŌRAX. [LORICA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRĀCES. [GLADIATORES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRANĪTAE. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRŎNUS (θρόνος), a throne, is a Greek word, for which the proper\r\nLatin term is _Solium_. This did not differ from a chair (καθέδρα)\r\n[CATHEDRA; SELLA] except in being higher, larger, and in all\r\nrespects more magnificent. On account of its elevation it was always\r\nnecessarily accompanied by a foot-stool (_subsellium_, ὑποπόδιον,\r\nθράνιον). The accompanying cut shows two gilded thrones with cushions\r\nand drapery, intended to be the thrones of Mars and Venus, which is\r\nexpressed by the helmet on the one and the dove on the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Throni. (From an ancient Painting.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHỸMĔLĒ. [THEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHỸRSUS (θύρσος), a pole carried by Bacchus, and by Satyrs, Maenades,\r\nand others who engaged in Bacchic festivities and rites. [DIONYSIA.]\r\nIt was sometimes terminated by the apple of the pine, or fir-cone,\r\nthat tree (πεύκη) being dedicated to Bacchus in consequence of the\r\nuse of the turpentine which flowed from it, and also of its cones,\r\nin making wine. The monuments of ancient art, however, most commonly\r\nexhibit, instead of the pine-apple, a bunch of vine or ivy-leaves,\r\nwith grapes or berries, arranged into the form of a cone. The\r\nfabulous history of Bacchus relates that he converted the thyrsi\r\ncarried by himself and his followers into dangerous weapons, by\r\nconcealing an iron point in the head of the leaves. Hence his thyrsus\r\nis called “a spear enveloped in vine-leaves,” and its point was\r\nthought to incite to madness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tiara. (From a Coin in the British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nTĬĀRA or TĬĀRAS (τιάρα or τιάρας: _Att._ κυρβασία), a hat with a\r\nlarge high crown. This was the head-dress which characterised the\r\nnorth-western Asiatics, and more especially the Armenians, Parthians,\r\nand Persians, as distinguished from the Greeks and Romans, whose hats\r\nfitted the head, or had only a low crown. The king of Persia wore an\r\nerect tiara, whilst those of his subjects were soft and flexible,\r\nfalling on one side. The Persian name for this regal head-dress was\r\n_cidaris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tiara. (From a Coin in the British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĪBĬA (αὐλός), a pipe, the commonest musical instrument of the Greeks\r\nand Romans. It was very frequently a hollow cane, perforated with\r\nholes in the proper places. In other instances it was made of some\r\nkind of wood, especially box, and was bored with a gimblet. When a\r\nsingle pipe was used by itself, the performer upon it, as well as\r\nthe instrument, was called _monaulos_. Among the varieties of the\r\nsingle pipe the most remarkable were the bagpipe, the performer on\r\nwhich was called _utricularius_ or ἀσκαύλης; and the ἀυλὸς πλάγιος or\r\nπλαγίαυλος, which, as its name implies, had a mouth-piece inserted\r\ninto it at right angles. Pan was the reputed inventor of this kind of\r\ntibia as well as of the _fistula_ or _syrinx_ [SYRINX]. But among\r\nthe Greeks and Romans it was much more usual to play on two pipes at\r\nthe same time. Hence a performance on this instrument (_tibicinium_),\r\neven when executed by a single person, was called _canere_ or\r\n_cantare tibiis_. This act is exhibited in very numerous works of\r\nancient art, and often in such a way as to make it manifest that the\r\ntwo pipes were perfectly distinct, and not connected, as some have\r\nsupposed, by a common mouth-piece. The mouth-pieces of the two pipes\r\noften passed through a capistrum. Three different kinds of pipes were\r\noriginally used to produce music in the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian\r\nmodes. It appears, also, that to produce the Phrygian mode the pipe\r\nhad only two holes above, and that it terminated in a horn bending\r\nupwards. It thus approached to the nature of a trumpet, and produced\r\nslow, grave, and solemn tunes. The Lydian mode was much quicker,\r\nand more varied and animating. Horace mentions “Lydian pipes” as a\r\nproper accompaniment, when he is celebrating the praise of ancient\r\nheroes. The Lydians themselves used this instrument in leading\r\ntheir troops to battle; and the pipes employed for the purpose are\r\ndistinguished by Herodotus as “male and female,” i.e. probably bass\r\nand treble, corresponding to the ordinary sexual difference in the\r\nhuman voice. The corresponding Latin terms are _tibia dextra_ and\r\n_sinistra_: the respective instruments are supposed to have been so\r\ncalled, because the former was more properly held in the right hand\r\nand the latter in the left. The “tibia _dextra_” was used to lead\r\nor commence a piece of music, and the “sinistra” followed it as an\r\naccompaniment. The comedies of Terence having been accompanied by\r\nthe pipe, the following notices are prefixed to explain the kind of\r\nmusic appropriate to each: _tibiis paribus_, i.e. with pipes in the\r\nsame mode; _tib. imparibus_, pipes in different modes; _tib. duabus\r\ndextris_, two pipes of low pitch; _tib. par. dextris et sinistris_,\r\npipes in the same mode, and of both low and high pitch. The use\r\nof the pipe among the Greeks and Romans was three-fold, viz. at\r\nsacrifices (_tibiae sacrificae_), entertainments (_ludicrae_), and\r\nfunerals. The pipe was not confined anciently, as it is with us, to\r\nthe male sex, but αὐλητρίδες, or female tibicines were very common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Woman Playing on two Pipes, Tibiae. (From a Vase in\r\nthe British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMĒMA (τίμημα). The penalty imposed in a court of criminal justice\r\nat Athens, and also the damages awarded in a civil action, received\r\nthe name of Τίμημα, because they were _estimated_ or _assessed_\r\naccording to the injury which the public or the individual might\r\nrespectively have sustained. The penalty was either fixed by the\r\njudge, or merely declared by him according to some estimate made\r\nbefore the cause came into court. In the first case the trial was\r\ncalled ἀγὼν τιμητὸς, in the second case ἀγὼν ἀτίμητος, a distinction\r\nwhich applies to civil as well as to criminal trials. Where a man\r\nsought to recover an estate in land, or a house, or any specific\r\nthing, as a ring, a horse, a slave, nothing further was required,\r\nthan to determine to whom the estate, the house, or the thing\r\ndemanded, of right belonged. The same would be the case in an action\r\nof debt, χρέους δίκη, where a sum certain was demanded. In these\r\nand many other similar cases the trial was ἀτίμητος. On the other\r\nhand, wherever the damages were in their nature _unliquidated_, and\r\nno provision had been made concerning them either by the law or\r\nby the agreement of the parties, they were to be assessed by the\r\ndicasts. The following was the course of proceeding in the τιμητοὶ\r\nἀγῶνες. The bill of indictment (ἔγκλημα) was always superscribed\r\nwith some penalty by the person who preferred it. He was said\r\nἐπιγράφεσθαι τίμημα, and the penalty proposed is called ἐπίγραμμα.\r\nIf the defendant was found guilty, the prosecutor was called upon to\r\nsupport the allegation in the indictment, and for that purpose to\r\nmount the platform and address the dicasts (ἀναβαίνειν εἰς τίμημα).\r\nIf the accused submitted to the punishment proposed on the other\r\nside, there was no further dispute; if he thought it too severe,\r\nhe made a counter proposition. He was then said ἀντιτιμᾶσθαι, or\r\nἑαυτῷ τιμᾶσθαι. He was allowed to address the court in mitigation\r\nof punishment. After both parties had been heard, the dicasts were\r\ncalled upon to give their verdict. Sometimes the law expressly\r\nempowered the jury to impose an additional penalty (προστίμημα)\r\nbesides the ordinary one. Here the proposition emanated from the jury\r\nthemselves, any one of whom might move that the punishment allowed by\r\nthe law should be awarded. He was said προστιμᾶσθαι, and the whole\r\ndicasts, if (upon a division) they adopted his proposal, were said\r\nπροστιμᾷν.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINTINNĀBŬLUM (κώδων), a bell. Bells were of various forms among the\r\nGreeks and Romans, as among us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĪRO, the name given by the Romans to a newly enlisted soldier, as\r\nopposed to _veteranus_, one who had had experience in war. The mode\r\nof levying troops is described under EXERCITUS. The age at which the\r\nliability to military service commenced was 17. From their first\r\nenrolment the Roman soldiers, when not actually serving against an\r\nenemy, were perpetually occupied in military exercises. They were\r\nexercised every day, the tirones twice, in the morning and afternoon,\r\nand the veterani once. The state of a tiro was called _tirocinium_;\r\nand a soldier who had attained skill in his profession was then\r\nsaid _tirocinium ponere_, or _deponere_. In civil life the terms\r\n_tiro_ and _tirocinium_ were applied to the assumption of the toga\r\nvirilis, which was called _tirocinium fori_ [TOGA], and to the first\r\nappearance of an orator at the rostrum, _tirocinum eloquentiae_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĪRŌCĬNĬUM. [TIRO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTĬTĬI SODĀLES, a sodalitas or college of priests at Rome, who\r\nrepresented the second tribe of the Romans, or the Tities, that\r\nis, the Sabines, who, after their union with the Ramnes or Latins,\r\ncontinued to perform their own ancient Sabine sacra. To superintend\r\nand preserve these, T. Tatius is said to have instituted the Titii\r\nsodales. During the time of the republic the Titii sodales are no\r\nlonger mentioned, as the sacra of the three tribes became gradually\r\nunited into one common religion. Under the empire we again meet with\r\na college of priests bearing the name of Sodales Titii or Titienses,\r\nor Sacerdotes Titiales Flaviales; but they had nothing to do with the\r\nsacra of the ancient tribe of the Tities, but were priests instituted\r\nto conduct the worship of an emperor, like the Augustales.\r\n\r\n\r\nTĬTĬES or TĬTĬENSES. [PATRICII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Form of the Toga spread out.]\r\n\r\nTŎGA (τήβεννος), a gown, the name of the principal outer garment\r\nworn by the Romans, seems to have been received by them from the\r\nEtruscans. The toga was the peculiar distinction of the Romans, who\r\nwere thence called _togati_ or _gens togata_. It was originally worn\r\nonly in Rome itself, and the use of it was forbidden alike to exiles\r\nand to foreigners. Gradually, however, it went out of common use,\r\nand was supplanted by the pallium and lacerna, or else it was worn\r\nin public under the lacerna. [LACERNA.] But it was still used by\r\nthe upper classes, who regarded it as an honourable distinction, in\r\nthe courts of justice, by clients when they received the SPORTULA,\r\nand in the theatre or at the games, at least when the emperor was\r\npresent. The exact form of the toga, and the manner of wearing it,\r\nhave occasioned much dispute; but the following account, for which\r\nthe writer is indebted to his friend Mr. George Scharf, jun., will\r\nset these matters in a clearer light than has hitherto been the case.\r\nThe complete arrangement of this dress may be seen in many antique\r\nstatues, but especially in that of Didius Julianus, in the Louvre,\r\nand a bronze figure of the elder Drusus discovered at Herculaneum.\r\n(See figs. 2, 3.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Statue of Didius Julianus. (From the Louvre.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Bronze of the elder Drusus. (From\r\nHerculaneum.)]\r\n\r\nThe letters upon particular parts of the illustrations correspond\r\nwith each other, and refer to the same places upon the general form\r\nof the toga given above. The method of adjusting the toga is simply\r\nthis: the straight edge (_a b g d_) being kept towards the neck, and\r\nthe rounded towards the hand, the first part of the toga hangs in\r\nfront over the left shoulder to the ground (_a_, fig. 4), so as to\r\ncover that entire half of the figure viewed in front. The remainder\r\nfalling behind is wrapped round the body, being carried _under_\r\nthe right arm, and brought upwards, like a belt, across the chest,\r\ncovering the left arm and shoulder for a second time. It again falls\r\nbehind, and terminates in the point _d_ (fig. 5), somewhat higher\r\nthan the front portion (_a_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nMode of putting on the Toga.]\r\n\r\nSo far any mantle of sufficient length might be folded, but two\r\ndistinctive features of Roman dress, the umbo (_f_) and the sinus\r\n(_c e_), have yet to be considered. The sinus (_c e_) is that\r\nupper hanging portion with the curved edge downwards which shows\r\nconspicuously upon the right thigh. When the toga has been brought\r\nround to the front of the right leg, it has attained its greatest\r\nwidth (_e c e_), although on the figure less space is required for\r\nit. It is therefore folded over at the top, the upper part falling\r\nforward, down almost to the knee. It may be easily raised (see fig.\r\n5) and used as a lap--hence the name sinus--to carry fruits and\r\nflowers, so often represented in ancient art. The fold at _c_ thus\r\nbecomes the upper edge, and forms the balteus, which may be made\r\nstill more effective by being rolled round and slightly twisted, as\r\nin figs. 2 and 5. A variety again was sometimes produced by lifting\r\nthe hanging edge (_e_) of this sinus up on to the shoulder, so as to\r\ncover the right arm with that alone, and Quintilian hints that it\r\nis not ungraceful to throw back the extreme edge of that again, an\r\neffect still to be admired in some of the ancient sculptures. Fig.\r\n5 is in the act of raising the edge. The umbo (_f_), a projecting\r\nmass of folds in front of the body, like the boss of a shield, was\r\nformed _after_ the rest of the dress had been put on in a very simple\r\nmanner: a part of the front upright line (_a b_), almost covered up\r\nby the adjustment of the upper shoulder portion (_g_), was pulled out\r\nand made to hang down over the balteus or belt-like part (fig. 6). It\r\nis clearly traceable in both statues here given (figs. 2 and 3), and\r\nfig. 4 is intended to show the formation of the umbo more clearly by\r\nthe right hand holding the edge, which falls over the fingers instead\r\nof the balteus. In proportion as the umbo (_f_) projects, so of\r\ncourse the end (_a_) is raised from the ground. The smaller figures\r\n(4 and 5) are both drawn without under-garments in order to avoid\r\nconfusion. During sacrifice, when necessary to cover the head, the\r\nedge (_b_) nearest the neck was pulled up and made to cover the head,\r\nas in fig. 3, where the entire length of the edge, passing from the\r\numbo into the sinus, is very clearly visible. The dress here is very\r\nample, and can spare an extra length, but in the statue of a priest\r\nin the Louvre the head is covered at the expense of the umbo, which\r\nhas entirely disappeared. Fig. 6 is intended to show the interlacing\r\nand arrangement of the toga by following the course of the straight\r\nedge alone from _a_ to _d_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nIn many ancient statues the sleeves and folds of the tunic, being\r\nvery full, are apt to be confounded with the rest, but in the best\r\nstyle of art this is not the case. Quintilian cautions his orators\r\nagainst these incumbrances. A difference in size and fulness of the\r\ntoga, modified according to the rank of the wearer, may be detected\r\nin coins and sculpture, but in all cases the mode of adjustment\r\nappears to be the same.--One mode of wearing the toga was the Cinctus\r\nGabinus. It consisted in forming a part of the toga itself into a\r\ngirdle, by drawing its outer edge round the body and tying it in a\r\nknot in front, and at the same time covering the head with another\r\nportion of the garment. It was worn by persons offering sacrifices,\r\nby the consul when he declared war, and by devoted persons, as in the\r\ncase of Decius. Its origin was Etruscan, as its name implies. Persons\r\nwearing this dress were said to be _procincti_ (or _incincti_)\r\n_cinctu_ (or _ritu_) _Gabino_.--The colour of the toga worn by men\r\n(_toga virilis_) was generally white, that is, the natural colour of\r\nwhite wool. Hence it was called _pura_ or _vestimentum purum_, in\r\nopposition to the _praetexta_ mentioned below. A brighter white was\r\ngiven to the toga of candidates for offices (_candidati_ from their\r\n_toga candida_) by rubbing it with chalk. There is an allusion to\r\nthis custom in the phrase _cretata ambitio_. White togas are often\r\nmentioned as worn at festivals, which does not imply that they were\r\nnot worn commonly, but that new or fresh-cleaned togas were first put\r\non at festivals. The toga was kept white and clean by the fuller.\r\nWhen this was neglected, the toga was called _sordida_, and those who\r\nwore such garments _sordidati_. This dress (with disarranged hair\r\nand other marks of disorder about the person) was worn by accused\r\npersons, as in the case of Cicero. The _toga pulla_, which was of\r\nthe natural colour of black wool, was worn in private mourning, and\r\nsometimes also by artificers and others of the lower orders.--The\r\n_toga picta_, which was ornamented with Phrygian embroidery, was\r\nworn by generals in triumphs [TRIUMPHUS], and under the emperors by\r\nthe consuls, and by the praetors when they celebrated the games.\r\nIt was also called _Capitolina_. The _toga palmata_ was a kind of\r\ntoga picta.--The _toga praetexta_ had a broad purple border. It was\r\nworn with the BULLA, by children of both sexes. It was also worn\r\nby magistrates, both those of Rome, and those of the colonies and\r\nmunicipia; by the sacerdotes, and by persons engaged in sacred rites\r\nor paying vows. Among those who possessed the _jus togae praetextae\r\nhabendae_, the following may be more particularly mentioned: the\r\ndictator, the consuls, the praetors (who laid aside the praetexta\r\nwhen about to condemn a Roman citizen to death), the augurs (who,\r\nhowever, are supposed by some to have worn the trabea), the decemviri\r\nsacris faciundis, the aediles, the triumviri epulones, the senators\r\non festival days, the magistri collegii, and the magistri vicorum\r\nwhen celebrating games. In the case of the tribuni plebis, censors,\r\nand quaestors, there is some doubt upon the subject. The toga\r\npraetexta is said to have been derived from the Etruscans, and to\r\nhave been first adopted, with the latus clavus [CLAVUS LATUS], by\r\nTullus Hostilius as the royal robe, whence its use by the magistrates\r\nin the republic. The toga praetexta and the bulla aurea were first\r\ngiven to boys in the case of the son of Tarquinius Priscus, who,\r\nat the age of fourteen, in the Sabine war, slew an enemy with his\r\nown hand. Respecting the leaving off of the toga praetexta, and the\r\nassumption of the toga virilis, see IMPUBES and CLAVUS LATUS. The\r\noccasion was celebrated with great rejoicings by the friends of the\r\nyouth, who attended him in a solemn procession to the Forum and\r\nCapitol. This assumption of the toga virilis was called _tirocinium\r\nfori_, as being the young man’s introduction to public life. Girls\r\nwore the praetexta till their marriage.--The _trabea_ was a toga\r\nornamented with purple horizontal stripes. There were three kinds\r\nof trabeae; one wholly of purple, which was sacred to the gods,\r\nanother of purple and white, and another of purple and saffron,\r\nwhich belonged to augurs. The purple and white trabea was a royal\r\nrobe, and is assigned to the Latin and early Roman kings, especially\r\nto Romulus. It was worn by the consuls in public solemnities,\r\nsuch as opening the temple of Janus. The equites wore it at the\r\n_transvectio_, and in other public solemnities. Hence the _trabea_\r\nis mentioned as the badge of the equestrian order. Lastly, the toga\r\nworn by the Roman emperors was wholly of purple. It appears to have\r\nbeen first assumed by Julius Caesar.--The material of which the toga\r\nwas commonly made was wool. It was sometimes thick and sometimes\r\nthin. The former was the _toga densa_, _pinguis_, or _hirta_. A new\r\ntoga, with the nap neither worn off nor cut close, was called pexa,\r\nto which is opposed the _trita_ or _rasa_, which was used as a summer\r\ndress. The toga was originally worn by both sexes; but when the stola\r\ncame to be worn by matrons, the toga was only worn by the meretrices,\r\nand by women who had been divorced on account of adultery. [STOLA.]\r\nIn war the toga was laid aside, and replaced by the PALUDAMENTUM and\r\nSAGUM. Hence _togatus_ is opposed to _miles_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTONSOR. [BARBA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTORCŬLAR, TORCŬLUM. [VINUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTORMENTUM (ἀφετήρια ὄργανα), a military engine, so called from the\r\ntwisting (_torquendo_) of hairs, thongs, and vegetable fibres. The\r\nprincipal military engines were the _balista_ and _catapulta_. The\r\n_balista_ (πετροβόλος) was used to shoot stones; the _catapulta_\r\n(καταπέλτης, καταπελτική) to project darts, especially the falarica\r\n[HASTA], and a kind of missile, 4½ feet long, called _trifax_. Whilst\r\nin besieging a city the ram [ARIES] was employed in destroying\r\nthe lower part of the wall, the balista was used to overthrow the\r\nbattlements (_propugnacula_, ἐπαλξεῖς), and the catapult to shoot\r\nany of the besieged who appeared between them: the forms of these\r\nmachines being adapted to the objects which they were intended to\r\nthrow; the catapult was long, the balista nearly square. Instances\r\nare recorded in which the balista threw stones to the distance of\r\na quarter of a mile. Some balistae threw stones weighing three\r\nhundredweight. Of the _scorpio_ or _onager_, which was also a species\r\nof tormentum, we know next to nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORMENTUM (βάσανος), torture. (1) GREEK.--By a decree of Scamandrius\r\nit was ordained that no free Athenian could be put to the torture,\r\nand this appears to have been the general practice. The evidence\r\nof slaves was, however, always taken with torture, and their\r\ntestimony was not otherwise received. From this circumstance their\r\ntestimony appears to have been considered of more value than that\r\nof freemen. Any person might offer his own slave to be examined by\r\ntorture, or demand that of his adversary, and the offer or demand\r\nwas equally called πρόκλησις εἰς βάσανον. The parties interested\r\neither superintended the torture themselves, or chose certain persons\r\nfor this purpose, hence called βασανισταὶ, who took the evidence\r\nof the slaves. (2) ROMAN.--During the time of the republic freemen\r\nwere never put to the torture, and slaves only were exposed to this\r\npunishment. Slaves, moreover, could not be tortured to prove the\r\nguilt of their own master, except in the case of incestus, which was\r\na crime against the gods, or unless the senate made an exception in\r\nsome special instance. At a later time slaves might be tortured to\r\nbear witness against their masters in cases of majestas and adultery.\r\nUnder the emperors even free persons were put to the torture to\r\nextract evidence from them in cases of majestas; and although this\r\nindignity was confined for the most part to persons in humble\r\ncircumstances, we read of cases in which even Roman senators and\r\nequites were exposed to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORQUES or TORQUIS (στρεπτός), an ornament of gold, twisted spirally\r\nand bent into a circular form, which was worn round the neck by men\r\nof distinction among the Persians, the Gauls, and other Asiatic and\r\nnorthern nations. It was by taking a collar from a Gallic warrior\r\nthat T. Manlius obtained the cognomen of _Torquatus_. Such collars\r\nwere among the rewards of valour bestowed after an engagement upon\r\nthose who had most distinguished themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTŎRUS, a bed covered with sheets or blankets, called _Toralia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĂBEA. [TOGA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĂGOEDIA (τραγῳδία), tragedy. (1) GREEK. The tragedy of the ancient\r\nGreeks as well as their comedy confessedly originated in the\r\nworship of the god Dionysus. The peculiarity which most strikingly\r\ndistinguishes the Greek tragedy from that of modern times, is the\r\nlyrical or choral part. This was the offspring of the dithyrambic and\r\nchoral odes from which, as applied to the worship of Dionysus, Greek\r\ntragedy took its rise. The name of Tragedy (τραγῳδία) is probably\r\nderived from the goatlike appearance of the Satyrs who sang or acted\r\nwith mimetic gesticulations (ὄρχησις) the old Bacchic songs, with\r\nSilenus, the constant companion of Dionysus, for their leader. The\r\nDionysian dithyrambs were sometimes of a gay and at other times\r\nof a mournful character: it was from the latter that the stately\r\nand solemn tragedy of the Greeks arose. Great improvements were\r\nintroduced in the dithyramb by Arion, a contemporary of Periander.\r\nBefore his time the dithyramb was sung in a wild and irregular\r\nmanner; but he is said to have invented the Cyclic chorus, by which\r\nwe are to understand that the Dithyramb was danced by a chorus of\r\nfifty men round an altar. The choral Dithyrambic songs prevailed\r\nto some extent, as all choral poetry did, amongst the Dorians of\r\nthe Peloponnesus; whence the choral element of the Attic tragedy\r\nwas always written in the Dorian dialect, thus showing its origin.\r\nThe lyrical poetry was, however, especially popular at Sicyon and\r\nCorinth. In the latter city Arion made his improvements; in the\r\nformer “tragic choruses,” i.e. dithyrambs of a sad and plaintive\r\ncharacter, were very ancient. From the more solemn Dithyrambs then,\r\nas improved by Arion, ultimately sprang the dramatic tragedy of\r\nAthens, somewhat in the following manner. The choruses were under\r\nthe direction of a leader or exarchus, who, it may be supposed,\r\ncame forward separately, and whose part was sometimes taken by\r\nthe poet himself. We may also conjecture that the exarchus in\r\neach case led off by singing or reciting his part in a solo, and\r\nthat the chorus dancing round the altar then expressed their\r\nfeelings of joy or sorrow at his story, representing the perils and\r\nsufferings of Dionysus, or some hero, as it might be. The subjects\r\nof this Dithyrambic tragedy were not, however, always confined\r\nto Dionysus. Even Arion wrote Dithyrambs, relating to different\r\nheroes, a practice in which he was followed by succeeding poets.\r\nIt is easy to conceive how the introduction of an actor or speaker\r\nindependent of the chorus might have been suggested by the exarchs\r\ncoming forward separately and making short off-hand speeches,\r\nwhether learnt by heart beforehand, or made on the spur of the\r\nmoment. [CHORUS.] But it is also possible, if not probable, that\r\nit was suggested by the rhapsodical recitations of the epic and\r\ngnomic poets formerly prevalent in Greece: the gnomic poetry being\r\ngenerally written in Iambic verse, the metre of the Attic dialogue.\r\nThis however is certain, that the union of the Iambic dialogue with\r\nthe lyrical chorus took place at Athens under Pisistratus, and\r\nthat it was attributed to Thespis, a native of Icaria, one of the\r\ncountry demes or parishes of Attica where the worship of Dionysus\r\nhad long prevailed. The alteration made by him, and which gave to\r\nthe old tragedy a new and dramatic character, was very simple but\r\nvery important. He introduced an actor, as it is recorded, for the\r\nsake of giving rest to the chorus, and independent of it, in which\r\ncapacity he probably appeared himself, taking various parts in the\r\nsame piece, under various disguises, which he was enabled to assume\r\nby means of linen masks, the invention of which is attributed to\r\nhim. Now as a chorus, by means of its leader, could maintain a\r\ndialogue with the actor, it is easy to see how with one actor only a\r\ndramatic action might be introduced, continued, and concluded, by the\r\nspeeches between the choral songs expressive of the joy or sorrow of\r\nthe chorus at the various events of the drama. With respect to the\r\ncharacter of the drama of Thespis there has been much doubt: some\r\nwriters, and especially Bentley, have maintained that his plays were\r\nall satyrical and ludicrous, i.e. the plot of them was some story\r\nof Bacchus, the chorus consisted principally of satyrs, and the\r\nargument was merry. But perhaps the truth is that in the early part\r\nof his career Thespis retained the satyrical character of the older\r\ntragedy, but afterwards inclined to more serious compositions, which\r\nwould almost oblige him to discard the Satyrs from his choruses.\r\nThat he did write serious dramas is intimated by the titles of the\r\nplays ascribed to him, as well as by the character of the fragments\r\nof Iambic verse quoted by ancient writers as his. It is evident that\r\nthe introduction of the dialogue must also have caused an alteration\r\nin the arrangement of the chorus, which could not remain cyclic or\r\ncircular, but must have been drawn up in a rectangular form about the\r\nthymele or altar of Bacchus in front of the actor, who was elevated\r\non a platform or table (ἐλεός), the forerunner of the stage. The\r\nlines of Horace (_Ar. Poet._ 276):--\r\n\r\n      “Dicitur et plaustris vexisse poemata Thespis,\r\n      Quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora”--\r\n\r\nare founded on a misconception of the origin of the Attic tragedy,\r\nand the tale about the waggons of Thespis probably arose out of a\r\nconfusion of the waggon of the comedian Susarion with the _platform_\r\nof the Thespian actor. The first representation of Thespis was in\r\nB.C. 535. His immediate successors were the Athenian Choerilus\r\nand Phrynichus, the former of whom represented plays as early as\r\nB.C. 524. Phrynichus was a pupil of Thespis, and gained his first\r\nvictory in the dramatic contests B.C. 511. In his works, the lyric\r\nor choral element still predominated over the dramatic, and he was\r\ndistinguished for the sweetness of his melodies, which in the time of\r\nthe Peloponnesian war were very popular with the admirers of the old\r\nstyle of music. The first use of female masks is also attributed to\r\nhim, and he so far deviated from the general practice of the Attic\r\ntragedians as to write a drama on a subject of contemporary history,\r\nthe capture of Miletus by the Persians, B.C. 494.--We now come to\r\nthe first writer of Satyrical dramas, Pratinas of Phlius, a town not\r\nfar from Sicyon, and which laid claim to the invention of tragedy\r\nas well as comedy. For some time previously to this poet, and\r\nprobably as early as Thespis, tragedy had been gradually departing\r\nmore and more from its old characteristics, and inclining to heroic\r\nfables, to which the chorus of Satyrs was not a fit accompaniment.\r\nBut the fun and merriment caused by them were too good to be lost.\r\nAccordingly the Satyrical drama, distinct from the recent and\r\ndramatic tragedy, but suggested by the sportive element of the old\r\nDithyramb, was founded by Pratinas, who however appears to have been\r\nsurpassed in his own invention by Choerilus. It was always written\r\nby tragedians, and generally three tragedies and one Satyrical piece\r\nwere represented together, which in some instances at least formed a\r\nconnected whole, called a tetralogy (τετραλογία). The Satyrical piece\r\nwas acted last, so that the minds of the spectators were agreeably\r\nrelieved by a merry after-piece at the close of an earnest and\r\nengrossing tragedy. The distinguishing feature of this drama was the\r\nchorus of Satyrs, in appropriate dresses and masks, and its subjects\r\nseem to have been taken from the same class of the adventures of\r\nBacchus and of the heroes as those of tragedy; but of course they\r\nwere so treated and selected, that the presence of rustic satyrs\r\nwould seem appropriate. In their jokes and drollery consisted the\r\nmerriment of the piece; for the kings and heroes who were introduced\r\ninto their company were not of necessity thereby divested of their\r\nepic and legendary character, though they were obliged to conform to\r\ntheir situation and suffer some diminution of dignity, from their\r\nposition. Hence Horace (_Ar. Poet._ 231) says:--\r\n\r\n      “Effutire leves indigna Tragoedia versus\r\n      Intererit Satyris paulum pudibunda protervis.”--\r\n\r\nalluding in the first line to the mythic or epic element of\r\nthe Satyric drama, which he calls Tragoedia, and in the second\r\nrepresenting it as being rather ashamed of its company. The “Cyclops”\r\nof Euripides is the only Satyric drama now extant.--The great\r\nimprovements in tragedy were introduced by Aeschylus. This poet added\r\na second actor, diminished the parts of the chorus, and made the\r\ndialogue the principal part of the action. He also availed himself of\r\nthe aid of Agatharchus, the scene-painter, and improved the costume\r\nof his actors by giving them thick-soled boots (ἐμβάται), as well as\r\nthe masks, which he made more expressive and characteristic. Horace\r\n(_Ar. Poet._ 278) thus alludes to his improvements:--\r\n\r\n              “personae pallaeque repertor honestae\r\n      Aeschylus, et modicis instravit pulpita tignis\r\n      Et docuit magnumque loqui, nitique cothurno.”--\r\n\r\nThe custom of contending with trilogies (τριλογίαι), or with three\r\nplays at a time, is said to have been also introduced by him. In\r\nfact he did so much for tragedy, and so completely built it up to\r\nits “towering height,” that he was considered the father of it.\r\nThe subjects of his dramas were not connected with the worship of\r\nDionysus; but rather with the great cycle of Hellenic legends and\r\nsome of the myths of the Homeric Epos. Accordingly, he said of\r\nhimself that his dramas were but scraps and fragments from the great\r\nfeasts of Homer. In the latter part of his life Aeschylus made use\r\nof one of the improvements of Sophocles, namely the τριταγωνιστής,\r\nor third actor. This was the finishing stroke to the dramatic\r\nelement of Attic tragedy, which Sophocles is said to have matured\r\nby further improvements in costume and scene-painting. Under him\r\ntragedy appears with less of sublimity and sternness than in the\r\nhands of Aeschylus, but with more of calm grandeur and quiet dignity\r\nand touching incident. The plays of Sophocles are the perfection of\r\nthe Grecian tragic drama, as a work of art and poetic composition in\r\na thoroughly chastened and classic style. In the hands of Euripides\r\ntragedy deteriorated not only in dignity, but also in its moral\r\nand religious significance. He introduces his heroes in rags and\r\ntatters, and busies them with petty affairs, and makes them speak the\r\nlanguage of every-day life. As Sophocles said of him, he represented\r\nmen not as they ought to be, but as they are, without any ideal\r\ngreatness or poetic character. His dialogues too were little else\r\nthan the rhetorical and forensic language of his day cleverly put\r\ninto verse: full of sophistry and quibbling distinctions. One of the\r\npeculiarities of his tragedies was the πρόλογος, an introductory\r\nmonologue, with which some hero or god opens the play, telling who\r\nhe is, what is the state of affairs, and what has happened up to\r\nthe time of his address, so as to put the audience in possession\r\nof every fact which it might be necessary for them to know: a\r\nvery business-like proceeding no doubt, but a poor make-shift for\r\nartistical skill. The “Deus ex machina,” also, though not always, in\r\na “nodus, tali vindice dignus,” was frequently employed by Euripides\r\nto effect the _dénoûment_ of his pieces. The chorus too no longer\r\ndischarged its proper and high functions either as a representative\r\nof the feelings of unprejudiced observers, or, as one of the actors,\r\nand a part of the whole, joining in the development of the piece.\r\nMany of his choral odes in fact are but remotely connected in subject\r\nwith the action of the play. Another novelty of Euripides was the\r\nuse of the monodies or lyrical songs, in which not the chorus,\r\nbut the principal persons of the drama, declare their emotions\r\nand sufferings. Euripides was also the inventor of tragi-comedy.\r\nA specimen of the Euripidean tragi-comedy is still extant in the\r\nAlcestis, acted B.C. 438, as the last of four pieces, and therefore\r\nas a substitute for a Satyrical drama. Though tragic in its form and\r\nsome of its scenes, it has a mixture of comic and satyric characters\r\n(_e.g._ Hercules) and concludes happily.--The parts which constitute\r\na Greek tragedy, _as to its form_, are, the prologue, episode, exode,\r\nand choral songs; the last divided into the parode and stasimon. The\r\nπρόλογος is all that part of a tragedy which precedes the parodos\r\nof the chorus, _i.e._ the first act. The ἐπεισόδιον is all the part\r\nbetween whole choral odes. The ἔξοδος that part which has no choral\r\node after it. Of the choral part the πάροδος is the first speech\r\nof the whole chorus (not broken up into parts): the stasimon is\r\nwithout anapaests and trochees. These two divisions were sung by\r\nall the choreutae, but the “songs on the stage” and the κόμμοι by a\r\npart only. The commus, which properly means a wailing for the dead,\r\nwas generally used to express strong excitement, or lively sympathy\r\nwith grief and suffering, especially by Aeschylus. It was common to\r\nthe actors and a portion only of the chorus. Again the πάροδος was\r\nso named as being the passage-song of the chorus sung while it was\r\nadvancing to its proper place in the orchestra, and therefore in\r\nanapaestic or marching verse: the στάσιμον, as being chaunted by the\r\nchorus when standing still in its proper position.--The materials of\r\nGreek tragedy were the national mythology,\r\n\r\n      “Presenting Thebes, or Pelop’s line,\r\n      Or the tale of Troy divine.”\r\n\r\nThe exceptions to this were the two historical tragedies, the\r\n“Capture of Miletus” by Phrynichus, and the “Persians” of Aeschylus;\r\nbut they belong to an early period of the art. Hence the plot\r\nand story of the Grecian tragedy were of necessity known to the\r\nspectators, a circumstance which strongly distinguishes the ancient\r\ntragedy from the modern.--The functions of the Chorus in Greek\r\nTragedy were very important, as described by Horace (_Ar. Poet._ 193),\r\n\r\n      “Actoris partes chorus officiumque virile\r\n      Defendat: neu quid medios intercinat actus,\r\n      Quod non proposito conducat, et haereat apte,” &c.\r\n\r\nIt often expresses the reflections of a dispassionate and\r\nright-minded spectator, and inculcates the lessons of morality and\r\nresignation to the will of heaven, taught by the occurrence of\r\nthe piece in which it is engaged. With respect to the number of\r\nthe chorus see CHORUS.--(2) ROMAN. The tragedy of the Romans was\r\nborrowed from the Greek, but the construction of the Roman theatre\r\nafforded no appropriate place for the chorus, which was therefore\r\nobliged to appear on the stage, instead of in the orchestra. The\r\nfirst tragic poet and actor at Rome was Livius Andronicus, a Greek\r\nby birth, who began to exhibit in B.C. 240. In his monodies (or the\r\nlyrical parts sung, not by a chorus, but by one person), it was\r\ncustomary to separate the singing from the mimetic dancing, leaving\r\nthe latter only to the actor, while the singing was performed by a\r\nboy placed near the flute-player (_ante tibicinem_); so that the\r\ndialogue only (_diverbia_) was left to be spoken by the actors.\r\nLivius Andronicus was followed by Naevius, Ennius, Pacuvius, and\r\nAttius. These five poets belong to the earlier epoch of Roman\r\ntragedy, in which little was written but translations and imitations\r\nof the Greek, with occasional insertions of original matter. How\r\nthey imitated the structure of the choral odes is doubtful--perhaps\r\nthey never attempted it. In the age of Augustus the writing of\r\ntragedies, whether original or imitations, seems to have been quite\r\na fashionable occupation. The emperor himself attempted an Ajax, but\r\ndid not succeed. One of the principal tragedians of this epoch was\r\nAsinius Pollio, to whom the line (Virg. _Eclog._ viii. 10) applies--\r\n\r\n      “Sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna cothurno.”\r\n\r\nOvid wrote a tragedy on the subject of Medea. Quintilian says of\r\nVarius, who was distinguished in epic as well as tragic poetry, that\r\nhis Thyestes might be compared with any of the Greek tragedies. Some\r\nfragments of this Thyestes are extant, but we have no other remains\r\nof the tragedy of the Augustan age. The loss perhaps is not great.\r\nThe only complete Roman tragedies that have come down to us are the\r\nten attributed to the philosopher Seneca; but whether he wrote any\r\nof them or not is a disputed point. To whatever age they belong,\r\nthey are beyond description bombastic and frigid, utterly unnatural\r\nin character and action, full of the most revolting violations of\r\npropriety, and barren of all theatrical effect. Still they have had\r\nadmirers: Heinsius calls the Hippolytus “divine,” and prefers the\r\nTroades to the Hecuba of Euripides: even Racine has borrowed from\r\nthe Hippolytus in Phèdre. Roman tragedians sometimes wrote tragedies\r\non subjects taken from their national history. Pacuvius, _e.g._\r\nwrote a _Paulus_, L. Accius a _Brutus_ and a _Decius_. Curiatius\r\nMaternus, also a distinguished orator in the reign of Domitian, wrote\r\na Domitius and a Cato, the latter of which gave offence to the rulers\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĀGŬLA.

[EXERCITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĪBŬLA or TRĪBŬLUM (τριβόλος), a corn-drag, consisting of a thick\r\nand ponderous wooden board, which was armed underneath with pieces\r\nof iron or sharp flints, and drawn over the corn by a yoke of oxen,\r\neither the driver or a heavy weight being placed upon it, for the\r\npurpose of separating the grain and cutting the straw.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬBŬLUS (τρίβολος), a caltrop, also called _murex_. When a place was\r\nbeset with troops, the one party endeavoured to impede the cavalry\r\nof the other party, either by throwing before them caltrops, which\r\nnecessarily lay with one of their four sharp points turned upwards,\r\nor by burying the caltrops with one point at the surface of the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬBŪNAL, a raised platform, on which the praetor and judices sat in\r\nthe Basilica. [BASILICA.] There was a tribunal in the camp, which\r\nwas generally formed of turf, but sometimes, in a stationary camp,\r\nof stone, from which the general addressed the soldiers, and where\r\nthe consul and tribunes of the soldiers administered justice. When\r\nthe general addressed the army from the tribunal the standards were\r\nplanted in front of it, and the army placed round it in order. The\r\naddress itself was called _Allocutio_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬBŪNUS, a tribune. This word seems originally to have indicated\r\nan officer connected with a tribe (_tribus_), or who represented a\r\ntribe for certain purposes; and this is indeed the character of the\r\nofficers who were designated by it in the earliest times of Rome,\r\nand may be traced also in the later officers of this name.--(1)\r\nTRIBUNES OF THE THREE ANCIENT TRIBES.--At the time when all the\r\nRoman citizens were contained in the three tribes of the Ramnes,\r\nTities, and Luceres, each of them was headed by a tribune, and these\r\nthree tribunes represented their respective tribes in all civil,\r\nreligious, and military affairs; that is to say, they were in the\r\ncity the magistrates of the tribes, and performed the sacra on their\r\nbehalf, and in times of war they were their military commanders.\r\nThe _tribunus celerum_ was the commander of the _celeres_, the\r\nking’s body-guard, and not the tribune of the tribe of the Ramnes,\r\nas is supposed by some modern writers. In what manner the tribunus\r\ncelerum was appointed is uncertain, but it is probable that he was\r\nelected by the tribes; for we find that when the imperium was to be\r\nconferred upon the king, the comitia were held under the presidency\r\nof the tribunus celerum; and in the absence of the king, to whom\r\nthis officer was next in rank, he convoked the comitia: it was in\r\nan assembly of this kind that Brutus proposed to deprive Tarquinius\r\nof the imperium. A law passed under the presidency of the tribunus\r\ncelerum was called a _lex tribunicia_, to distinguish it from one\r\npassed under the presidency of the king. The tribunes of the three\r\nancient tribes ceased to be appointed when these tribes themselves\r\nceased to exist as political bodies, and when the patricians became\r\nincorporated in the local tribes of Servius Tullius. [TRIBUS.]--(2)\r\nTRIBUNES OF THE SERVIAN TRIBES (φύλαρχοι, τριττυάρχοι).--When Servius\r\nTullius divided the commonalty into thirty local tribes, we again\r\nfind a tribune at the head of these tribes. The duties of these\r\ntribunes, who were without doubt the most distinguished persons\r\nin their respective districts, appear to have consisted at first\r\nin keeping a register of the inhabitants in each district, and of\r\ntheir property, for purposes of taxation, and for levying the troops\r\nfor the armies. When subsequently the Roman people became exempted\r\nfrom taxes, the main part of their business was taken from them,\r\nbut they still continued to exist. The _tribuni aerarii_, who occur\r\ndown to the end of the republic, were perhaps only the successors\r\nof the tribunes of the tribes. When (B.C. 406) the custom of giving\r\npay (_stipendium_) to the soldiers was introduced, each of the\r\ntribuni aerarii had to collect the tributum in his own tribe, and\r\nwith it to pay the soldiers; and in case they did not fulfil this\r\nduty, the soldiers had the right of pignoris capio against them. In\r\nlater times their duties appear to have been confined to collecting\r\nthe tributum, which they made over to the military quaestors who\r\npaid the soldiers. [QUAESTOR.] The Lex Aurelia, B.C. 70, called\r\nthe tribuni aerarii to the exercise of judicial functions, along\r\nwith the senators and equites, as these tribunes represented the\r\nbody of the most respectable citizens. But of this distinction they\r\nwere subsequently deprived by Julius Caesar.--(3) TRIBUNI PLEBIS\r\n(δήμαρχοι, the office δημαρχία).--The ancient tribunes of the\r\nplebeian tribes had undoubtedly the right of convoking the meetings\r\nof their tribes, and of maintaining the privileges granted to them\r\nby king Servius, and subsequently by the Valerian laws. But this\r\nprotection was very inadequate against the insatiable ambition and\r\nusurpations of the patricians. When the plebeians, impoverished by\r\nlong wars, and cruelly oppressed by the patricians, at last seceded\r\nin B.C. 494 to the Mons Sacer, the patricians were obliged to grant\r\nto the plebeians the right of appointing tribunes (_tribuni plebis_)\r\nwith more efficient powers to protect their own order than those\r\nwhich were possessed by the heads of the tribes. The purpose for\r\nwhich they were appointed was only to afford protection against\r\nany abuse on the part of the patrician magistrates; and that they\r\nmight be able to afford such protection their persons were declared\r\nsacred and inviolable, and it was agreed that whoever invaded this\r\ninviolability should be an outlaw, and that his property should be\r\nforfeited to the temple of Ceres. A subsequent law enacted that no\r\none should oppose or interrupt a tribune while addressing the people,\r\nand that whoever should act contrary to this ordinance should give\r\nbail to the tribunes for the payment of whatever fine they should\r\naffix to his offence in arraigning him before the commonalty; if\r\nhe refused to give bail, his life and property were forfeited. The\r\ntribunes were thus enabled to afford protection to any one who\r\nappealed to the assembly of the commonalty or required any other\r\nassistance. They were essentially the representatives and the organs\r\nof the plebeian order, and their sphere of action was the comitia\r\ntributa. With the patricians and their comitia they had nothing to\r\ndo. The tribunes themselves, however, were not judges, and could\r\ninflict no punishments, but could only propose the imposition of a\r\nfine to the commonalty (_multam irrogare_). The tribunes were thus\r\nin their origin only a protecting magistracy of the plebs, but in\r\nthe course of time their power increased to such a degree that it\r\nsurpassed that of all other magistrates, and the tribunes then became\r\na magistracy for the whole Roman people, in opposition to the senate\r\nand the oligarchical party in general, although they had nothing\r\nto do with the administration or the government. During the latter\r\nperiod of the republic they became true tyrants, and may be compared\r\nto the national convention of France during the first revolution. At\r\nfirst the number of the tribunes was only two, but soon afterwards\r\nthey were increased to five, one being taken from each of the five\r\nclasses, and subsequently to ten, two being taken from each of the\r\nfive classes. This last number appears to have remained unaltered\r\ndown to the end of the empire. The tribunes entered upon their office\r\non the 10th of December, but were elected, at least in the time of\r\nCicero, on the 17th of July. It is almost superfluous to state that\r\nnone but plebeians were eligible to the office of tribune; hence\r\nwhen, towards the end of the republic, patricians wished to obtain\r\nthe office, they were obliged first to renounce their own order and\r\nto become plebeians; hence also under the empire it was thought that\r\nthe princeps should not be tribune because he was a patrician. But\r\nthe influence which belonged to this office was too great for the\r\nemperors not to covet it. Hence Augustus was made tribune for life.\r\nDuring the republic, however, the old regulation remained in force,\r\neven after the tribunes had ceased to be the protectors of the plebs\r\nalone. There is only one instance recorded in which patricians were\r\nelected to the tribuneship, and this was probably the consequence\r\nof an attempt to divide the tribuneship between the two orders.\r\nAlthough nothing appears to be more natural than that the tribunes\r\nshould originally have been elected by that body of Roman citizens\r\nwhich they represented, yet the subject is involved in considerable\r\nobscurity. Some writers state that they were elected by the comitia\r\nof the curies; others suppose that they were elected in the comitia\r\nof the centuries; but whether they were elected in the latter or in\r\nthe comitia of the tribes, it is certain that at first the sanction\r\nof the curies to the election was at all events necessary. But after\r\nthe time of the Lex Publilia (B.C. 472) the sanction of the curies is\r\nnot heard of, and the election of the tribunes was left entirely to\r\nthe comitia tributa, which were convoked and held for this purpose\r\nby the old tribunes previous to the expiration of their office. One\r\nof the old tribunes was appointed by lot to preside at the election.\r\nAs the meeting could not be prolonged after sunset, and the business\r\nwas to be completed in one day, it sometimes happened that it was\r\nobliged to break up before the election was completed, and then those\r\nwho were elected filled up the legitimate number of the college by\r\ncooptatio. But in order to prevent this irregularity, the tribune L.\r\nTrebonius, in 448 B.C., got an ordinance passed, according to which\r\nthe college of the tribunes should never be completed by cooptatio,\r\nbut the elections should be continued on the second day, if they were\r\nnot completed on the first, till the number ten was made up. The\r\nplace where the election of the tribunes was held was originally and\r\nlawfully the Forum, afterwards also the Campus Martius, and sometimes\r\nthe area of the Capitol.--We now proceed to trace the gradual growth\r\nof the tribunitian power. Although its original character was merely\r\nprotection (_auxilium_ or βοήθεια) against patrician magistrates,\r\nthe plebeians appear early to have regarded their tribunes also as\r\nmediators or arbitrators in matters among themselves. The whole power\r\npossessed by the college of tribunes was designated by the name\r\n_tribunicia potestas_, and extended at no time farther than one mile\r\nbeyond the gates of the city; at a greater distance than this they\r\ncame under the imperium of the magistrates, like every other citizen.\r\nAs they were the public guardians, it was necessary that every one\r\nshould have access to them and at any time; hence the doors of their\r\nhouses were open day and night for all who were in need of help and\r\nprotection, which they were empowered to afford against any one, even\r\nagainst the highest magistrates. For the same reason a tribune was\r\nnot allowed to be absent from the city for a whole day, except during\r\nthe Feriae Latinae, when the whole people were assembled on the\r\nAlban Mount. In B.C. 456 the tribunes, in opposition to the consuls,\r\nassumed the right of convoking the senate, in order to lay before it\r\na rogation, and discuss the same; for until that time the consuls\r\nalone had had the right of laying plebiscita before the senate for\r\napprobation. Some years after, B.C. 452, the tribunes demanded of\r\nthe consuls to request the senate to make a senatusconsultum for the\r\nappointment of persons to frame a new legislation; and during the\r\ndiscussions on this subject the tribunes themselves were present in\r\nthe senate. The written legislation which the tribunes then wished\r\ncan only have related to their own order; but as such a legislation\r\nwould only have widened the breach between the two orders, they\r\nafterwards gave way to the remonstrances of the patricians, and\r\nthe new legislation was to embrace both orders. From the second\r\ndecemvirate the tribuneship was suspended, but was restored after\r\nthe legislation was completed, and now assumed a different character\r\nfrom the change that had taken place in the tribes. [TRIBUS.] The\r\ntribunes now had the right to be present at the deliberations of\r\nthe senate; but they did not sit among the senators themselves,\r\nbut upon benches before the opened doors of the senate house. The\r\ninviolability of the tribunes, which had before only rested upon a\r\ncontract between the two estates, was now sanctioned and confirmed by\r\na law of M. Horatius. As the tribes now also included the patricians\r\nand their clients, the tribunes might naturally be asked to interpose\r\non behalf of any citizen, whether patrician or plebeian. Hence the\r\npatrician ex-decemvir, Appius Claudius, implored the protection of\r\nthe tribunes. About this time the tribunes also acquired the right\r\nof taking the auspices in the assemblies of the tribes. They also\r\nassumed again the right, which they had exercised before the time\r\nof the decemvirate, of bringing patricians who had violated the\r\nrights of the plebeians before the comitia of the tribes. By the Lex\r\nValeria passed in the Comitia Centuriata (B.C. 449), it was enacted\r\nthat a plebiscitum, which had been voted by the tribes, should bind\r\nthe patricians as well. While the college thus gained outwardly new\r\nstrength every day, a change took place in its internal organisation,\r\nwhich to some extent paralysed its powers. Before B.C. 394, every\r\nthing had been decided in the college by a majority; but about this\r\ntime, we do not know how, a change was introduced, which made the\r\nopposition (_intercessio_) of one tribune sufficient to render a\r\nresolution of his colleagues void. This new regulation does not\r\nappear in operation till 394 and 393 B.C.; the old one was still\r\napplied in B.C. 421 and 415. From their right of appearing in the\r\nsenate, and of taking part in its discussions, and from their being\r\nthe representatives of the whole people, they gradually obtained\r\nthe right of intercession against any action which a magistrate\r\nmight undertake during the time of his office, and this even without\r\ngiving any reason for it. Thus we find a tribune preventing a consul\r\nfrom convoking the senate, and preventing the proposal of new laws\r\nor elections in the comitia; they interceded against the official\r\nfunctions of the censors; and even against a command issued by the\r\npraetor. In the same manner a tribune might place his veto upon an\r\nordinance of the senate; and he could thus either compel the senate\r\nto submit the subject to a fresh consideration, or could raise the\r\nsession. In order to propose a measure to the senate they might\r\nthemselves convene a meeting, or when it had been convened by a\r\nconsul they might make their proposal even in opposition to the\r\nconsul, a right which no other magistrates had in the presence of the\r\nconsuls. The senate, on the other hand, had itself, in certain cases,\r\nrecourse to the tribunes. Thus, in B.C. 431 it requested the tribunes\r\nto compel the consuls to appoint a dictator, in compliance with a\r\ndecree of the senate, and the tribunes compelled the consuls, by\r\nthreatening them with imprisonment, to appoint A. Postumius Tubertus\r\ndictator. From this time forward we meet with several instances in\r\nwhich the tribunes compelled the consuls to comply with the decrees\r\nof the senate, _si non essent in auctoritate senatus_, and to execute\r\nits commands. In their relation to the senate a change was introduced\r\nby the _Plebiscitum Atinium_, which ordained that a tribune, by\r\nvirtue of his office, should be a senator. When this plebiscitum was\r\nmade is uncertain; but we know that in B.C. 170 it was not yet in\r\noperation. It probably originated with C. Atinius, who was tribune in\r\nB.C. 132. But as the quaestorship, at least in later times, was the\r\noffice which persons held previously to the tribuneship, and as the\r\nquaestorship itself conferred upon a person the right of a senator,\r\nthe law of Atinius was in most cases superfluous.--In their relation\r\nto other magistrates we may observe, that the right of intercessio\r\nwas not confined to stopping a magistrate in his proceedings, but\r\nthey might even command their viatores to seize a consul or a censor,\r\nto imprison him, or to throw him from the Tarpeian rock. When the\r\ntribunes brought an accusation against any one before the people,\r\nthey had the right of _prehensio_, but not the right of _vocatio_,\r\nthat is, they might command a person to be dragged by their viatores\r\nbefore the comitia, but they could not summon him. They might, as in\r\nearlier times, propose a fine to be inflicted upon the person accused\r\nbefore the comitia, but in some cases they dropped this proposal\r\nand treated the case as a capital one. The college of tribunes had\r\nalso the power of making edicts. In cases in which one member of\r\nthe college opposed a resolution of his colleagues nothing could be\r\ndone, and the measure was dropped; but this useful check was removed\r\nby the example of Tiberius Gracchus, in which a precedent was given\r\nfor proposing to the people that a tribune obstinately persisting\r\nin his veto should be deprived of his office. From the time of the\r\nHortensian law the power of the tribunes had been gradually rising\r\nto such a height that at length it was superior to every other in\r\nthe state. They had acquired the right of proposing to the comitia\r\ntributa or the senate measures on nearly all the important affairs of\r\nthe state, and it would be endless to enumerate the cases in which\r\ntheir power was manifested. Their proposals were indeed usually made\r\nex auctoritate senatus, or had been communicated to and approved by\r\nit; but cases in which the people itself had a direct interest, such\r\nas a general legal regulation, granting of the franchise, a change in\r\nthe duties and powers of a magistrate, and others, might be brought\r\nbefore the people, without their having been previously communicated\r\nto the senate, though there are also instances of the contrary.\r\nSubjects belonging to the administration could not be brought before\r\nthe tribes without the tribunes having previously received through\r\nthe consuls the auctoritas of the senate. This, however, was done\r\nvery frequently, and hence we have mention of a number of plebiscita\r\non matters of administration. It sometimes even occurs that the\r\ntribunes brought the question concerning the conclusion of peace\r\nbefore the tribes, and then compelled the senate to ratify the\r\nresolution, as expressing the wish of the whole people. Sulla, in his\r\nreform of the constitution on the early aristocratic principles, left\r\nto the tribunes only the jus auxiliandi, and deprived them of the\r\nright of making legislative or other proposals, either to the senate\r\nor the comitia, without having previously obtained the sanction of\r\nthe senate. But this arrangement did not last, for Pompey restored to\r\nthem their former rights. During the latter period of the republic,\r\nwhen the office of quaestor was in most cases held immediately\r\nbefore that of tribune, the tribunes were generally elected from\r\namong the senators, and this continued to be the case under the\r\nempire. Sometimes, however, equites also obtained the office, and\r\nthereby became members of the senate, where they were considered\r\nof equal rank with the quaestors. Tribunes of the people continued\r\nto exist down to the fifth century of our era, though their powers\r\nbecame naturally much limited, especially in the reign of Nero. They\r\ncontinued however to have the right of intercession against decrees\r\nof the senate, and on behalf of injured individuals.--(4) TRIBUNI\r\nMILITUM CUM CONSULARI POTESTATE. When in B.C. 445 the tribune C.\r\nCanuleius brought forward the rogation that the consulship should not\r\nbe confined to either order, the patricians evaded the attempt by a\r\nchange in the constitution; the powers which had hitherto been united\r\nin the consulship were now divided between two new magistrates,\r\nviz. the _Tribuni militum cum consulari potestate_ and the censors.\r\nConsequently, in B.C. 444, three military tribunes, with consular\r\npower, were appointed, and to this office the plebeians were to\r\nbe equally eligible with the patricians. For the years following,\r\nhowever, the people were to be at liberty, on the proposal of the\r\nsenate, to decide whether consuls were to be elected according to\r\nthe old custom, or consular tribunes. Henceforth, for many years,\r\nsometimes consuls and sometimes consular tribunes were appointed,\r\nand the number of the latter varied from three to four, until in\r\nB.C. 405 it was increased to six, and as the censors were regarded\r\nas their colleagues, we have sometimes mention of eight tribunes.\r\nAt last, however, in B.C. 367, the office of these tribunes was\r\nabolished by the Licinian law, and the consulship was restored. These\r\nconsular tribunes were elected in the comitia of the centuries, and\r\nundoubtedly with less solemn auspices than the consuls.--(5) TRIBUNI\r\nMILITARES [EXERCITUS, p. 169.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬBUS (φῦλον, φυλή), a tribe. (1) GREEK. In the earliest times of\r\nGreek history mention is made of people being divided into tribes\r\nand clans. Homer speaks of such divisions in terms which seem to\r\nimply that they were elements that entered into the composition of\r\nevery community. A person not included in any clan (ἀφρήτωρ), was\r\nregarded as a vagrant or outlaw. These divisions were rather natural\r\nthan political, depending on family connection, and arising out of\r\nthose times, when each head of a family exercised a patriarchal sway\r\nover its members. The bond was cemented by religious communion,\r\nsacrifices and festivals, which all the family or clansmen attended,\r\nand at which the chief usually presided.--Of the Dorian race\r\nthere were originally three tribes, traces of which are found in\r\nall the countries which they colonised. Hence they are called by\r\nHomer Δωριέες τριχάϊκες. These tribes were the _Hylleis_ (Ὑλλεῖς),\r\n_Pamphyli_ (Πάμφυλοι), and _Dymanatae_ or _Dymanes_ (Δυμανάται or\r\nΔυμᾶνες). The first derived their name from Hyllus, son of Hercules,\r\nthe two last from Pamphylus and Dymas, who are said to have fallen\r\nin the last expedition when the Dorians took possession of the\r\nPeloponnesus. The Hyllean tribe was perhaps the one of highest\r\ndignity; but at Sparta there does not appear to have been much\r\ndistinction, for all the freemen there were by the constitution of\r\nLycurgus on a footing of equality. To these three tribes others\r\nwere added in different places, either when the Dorians were joined\r\nby other foreign allies, or when some of the old inhabitants were\r\nadmitted to the rank of citizenship or equal privileges. Thus the\r\nCadmean Aegeids are said by Herodotus to have been a great tribe\r\nat Sparta, descended (as he says) from Aegeus, grandson of Theras,\r\nthough others have thought they were incorporated with the three\r\nDoric tribes. The subdivision of tribes into _phratriae_ (φρατρίαι)\r\nor _patrae_ (πάτραι), _genē_ (γένη), _trittyes_ (τρίττυες), &c.\r\nappears to have prevailed in various places. At Sparta each tribe\r\ncontained ten _obae_ (ὠβαί), a word denoting a local division\r\nor district; each _obe_ contained ten _triacades_ (τριακάδες),\r\ncommunities containing thirty families. But very little appears\r\nto be known of these divisions, how far they were local, or how\r\nfar genealogical. After the time of Cleomenes the old system of\r\ntribes was changed; new ones were created corresponding to the\r\ndifferent quarters of the town, and they seem to have been five in\r\nnumber.--The first Attic tribes that we read of are said to have\r\nexisted in the reign, or soon after the reign, of Cecrops, and were\r\ncalled _Cecropis_ (Κεκροπίς), _Autochthon_ (Αὐτόχθων), _Actaea_\r\n(Ἀκταία), and _Paralia_ (Παραλία). In the reign of a subsequent king,\r\nCranaus, these names were changed to _Cranais_ (Κραναΐς), _Atthis_\r\n(Ἀτθίς), _Mesogaea_ (Μεσόγαια), and _Diacris_ (Διακρίς). Afterwards\r\nwe find a new set of names; _Dias_ (Διάς), _Athenais_ (Ἀθηναΐς),\r\n_Poseidonias_ (Ποσειδωνιάς), and _Hephaestias_ (Ἡφαιστιάς); evidently\r\nderived from the deities who were worshipped in the country. Some\r\nof those secondly mentioned, if not all of them, seem to have been\r\ngeographical divisions; and it is not improbable that, if not\r\nindependent communities, they were at least connected by a very\r\nweak bond of union. But all these tribes were superseded by four\r\nothers, which were probably founded soon after the Ionic settlement\r\nin Attica, and seem to have been adopted by other Ionic colonies out\r\nof Greece. The names _Geleontes_ (Γελέοντες), _Hopletes_ (Ὅπλητες),\r\n_Argades_ (Ἀργάδεις), _Aegicores_ (Αἰγικορεῖς), are said by Herodotus\r\nto have been derived from the sons of Ion, son of Xuthus. Upon\r\nthis, however, many doubts have been thrown by modern writers. The\r\netymology of the last three names would seem to suggest, that the\r\ntribes were so called from the occupations which their respective\r\nmembers followed; the _Hopletes_ being the armed men, or warriors;\r\nthe _Argades_, labourers or husbandmen; the _Aegicores_, goatherds\r\nor shepherds. But whatever be the truth with respect to the origin\r\nof these tribes, one thing is certain, that before the time of\r\nTheseus, whom historians agree in representing as the great founder\r\nof the Attic commonwealth, the various people who inhabited the\r\ncountry continued to be disunited and split into factions.--Theseus\r\nin some measure changed the relations of the tribes to each\r\nother, by introducing a gradation of ranks in each; dividing the\r\npeople into _Eupatridae_ (Εὐπατρίδαι), _Geomori_ (Γεωμόροι), and\r\n_Demiurgi_ (Δημιουργοί), of whom the first were nobles, the second\r\nagriculturists or yeomen, the third labourers and mechanics. At the\r\nsame time, in order to consolidate the national unity, he enlarged\r\nthe city of Athens, with which he incorporated several smaller towns,\r\nmade it the seat of government, encouraged the nobles to reside\r\nthere, and surrendered a part of the royal prerogative in their\r\nfavour. The tribes or phylae were divided, either in the age of\r\nTheseus or soon after, each into three _phratriae_ (φρατρίαι, a term\r\nequivalent to fraternities, and analogous in its political relation\r\nto the Roman _curiae_), and each _phratria_ into thirty _gene_ (γένη,\r\nequivalent to the Roman _Gentes_), the members of a _genos_ (γένος)\r\nbeing called _gennetae_ (γεννῆται) or _homogalactes_ (ὁμογαλάκτες).\r\nEach _genos_ was distinguished by a particular name of a patronymic\r\nform, which was derived from some hero or mythic ancestor. These\r\ndivisions, though the names seem to import family connection, were\r\nin fact artificial; which shows that some advance had now been made\r\ntowards the establishment of a closer political union. The members of\r\nthe _phratriae_ and _gene_ had their respective religious rites and\r\nfestivals, which were preserved long after these communities had lost\r\ntheir political importance, and perhaps prevented them from being\r\naltogether dissolved.--After the age of Theseus, the monarchy having\r\nbeen first limited and afterwards abolished, the whole power of the\r\nstate fell into the hands of the _Eupatridae_ or nobles, who held all\r\ncivil offices, and had besides the management of religious affairs,\r\nand the interpretation of the laws. Attica became agitated by feuds,\r\nand we find the people, shortly before the legislation of Solon,\r\ndivided into three parties, _Pediaei_ (Πεδιαῖοι) or lowlanders,\r\n_Diacrii_ (Διάκριοι) or highlanders, and _Parali_ (Πάραλοι) or people\r\nof the sea-coast. The first two remind us of the ancient division of\r\ntribes, _Mesogaea_ and _Diacris_; and the three parties appear in\r\nsome measure to represent the classes established by Theseus, the\r\nfirst being the nobles, whose property lay in the champaign and most\r\nfertile part of the country; the second, the smaller landowners and\r\nshepherds; the third, the trading and mining class, who had by this\r\ntime risen in wealth and importance. To appease their discords, Solon\r\nwas applied to; and thereupon framed his celebrated constitution and\r\ncode of laws. Here we have only to notice that he retained the four\r\ntribes as he found them, but abolished the existing distinctions of\r\n_rank_, or at all events greatly diminished their importance, by\r\nintroducing his property qualification, or division of the people\r\ninto _Pentacosiomedimni_ (Πεντακοσιομέδιμνοι), _Hippeis_ (Ἱππεῖς),\r\n_Zeugitae_ (Ζευγῖται), and _Thetes_ (Θῆτες). [CENSUS, GREEK.] The\r\nenactments of Solon continued to be the _law_ at Athens, though in\r\ngreat measure suspended by the tyranny, until the democratic reform\r\neffected by Clisthenes. He abolished the old tribes, and created ten\r\nnew ones, according to a geographical division of Attica, and named\r\nafter ten of the ancient heroes: _Erechtheis_, _Aegeis_, _Pandionis_,\r\n_Leontis_, _Acamantis_, _Oeneis_, _Cecropis_, _Hippothoontis_,\r\n_Aeantis_, _Antiochis_. These tribes were divided each into ten\r\n_demi_ (δῆμοι), the number of which was afterwards increased by\r\nsubdivision; but the arrangement was so made that several _demi_ not\r\ncontiguous or near to one another were joined to make up a tribe.\r\n[DEMUS.] The object of this arrangement was, that by the breaking of\r\nold associations a perfect and lasting revolution might be effected,\r\nin the habits and feelings, as well as the political organisation of\r\nthe people. Solon allowed the ancient _phratriae_ to exist, but they\r\nwere deprived of all political importance. All foreigners admitted\r\nto the citizenship were registered in a phyle and demus, but not in\r\na phratria or genos. The functions which had been discharged by the\r\nold tribes were now mostly transferred to the _demi_. Among others,\r\nwe may notice that of the forty-eight _naucrariae_ into which the old\r\ntribes had been divided for the purpose of taxation, but which now\r\nbecame useless, the taxes being collected on a different system. The\r\nreforms of Clisthenes were destined to be permanent. They continued\r\nto be in force (with some few interruptions) until the downfall of\r\nAthenian independence. The ten tribes were blended with the whole\r\nmachinery of the constitution. Of the senate of five hundred, fifty\r\nwere chosen from each tribe. The allotment of dicasts was according\r\nto tribes; and the same system of election may be observed in most\r\nof the principal offices of state, judicial and magisterial, civil\r\nand military, &c. In B.C. 307, Demetrius Poliorcetes increased\r\nthe number of tribes to twelve by creating two new ones, namely,\r\n_Antigonias_ and _Demetrias_, which afterwards received the names of\r\n_Ptolemais_ and _Attalis_; and a thirteenth was subsequently added\r\nby Hadrian, bearing his own name.--(2) ROMAN. The three ancient\r\nRomulian tribes, the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, or the Ramnenses,\r\nTitienses, and Lucerenses, to which the patricians alone belonged,\r\nmust be distinguished from the thirty plebeian tribes of Servius\r\nTullius, which were entirely local, four for the city, and twenty-six\r\nfor the country around Rome. The history and organisation of the\r\nthree ancient tribes are spoken of under PATRICII. They continued\r\nof political importance almost down to the period of the decemviral\r\nlegislation; but after this time they no longer occur in the history\r\nof Rome, except as an obsolete institution. The institution and\r\norganisation of the thirty plebeian tribes, and their subsequent\r\nreduction to twenty by the conquests of Porsena, are spoken of\r\nunder PLEBES. The four city tribes were called by the same names\r\nas the regions which they occupied, viz. _Suburana_, _Esquilina_,\r\n_Collina_, and _Palatina_. The names of the sixteen country tribes\r\nwhich continued to belong to Rome after the conquest of Porsena,\r\nare in their alphabetical order as follows: _Aemilia_, _Camilia_,\r\n_Cornelia_, _Fabia_, _Galeria_, _Horatia_, _Lemonia_, _Menemia_,\r\n_Papiria_, _Pollia_, _Popillia, upinia_, _Romilia_, _Sergia_,\r\n_Veturia_, and _Voltinia_. As Rome gradually acquired possession of\r\nmore of the surrounding territory, the number of tribes also was\r\ngradually increased. When Appius Claudius, with his numerous train\r\nof clients, emigrated to Rome, lands were assigned to them in the\r\ndistrict where the Anio flows into the Tiber, and a new tribe, the\r\n_tribus Claudia_, was formed. This tribe was subsequently enlarged,\r\nand was then designated by the name _Crustumina_ or _Clustumina_.\r\nThis name is the first instance of a country tribe being named after\r\na place, for the sixteen older ones all derived their name from\r\npersons or heroes. In B.C. 387, the number of tribes was increased to\r\ntwenty-five by the addition of four new ones, viz. the _Stellatina_,\r\n_Tromentina_, _Sabatina_, and _Arniensis_. In B.C. 358 two more, the\r\n_Pomptina_ and _Publilia_, were formed of Volscians. In B.C. 332, the\r\ncensors Q. Publilius Philo and Sp. Postumius increased the number of\r\ntribes to twenty-nine, by the addition of the _Maecia_ and _Scaptia_.\r\nIn B.C. 318 the _Ufentina_ and _Falerina_ were added. In B.C. 299 two\r\nothers, the _Aniensis_ and _Terentina_, were added by the censors,\r\nand at last in B.C. 241, the number of tribes was augmented to\r\nthirty-five, by the addition of the _Quirina_ and _Velina_. Eight\r\nnew tribes were added upon the termination of the Social War, to\r\ninclude the Socii, who then obtained the Roman franchise; but they\r\nwere afterwards incorporated among the old 35 tribes, which continued\r\nto be the number of the tribes to the end of the republic. When the\r\ntribes, in their assemblies, transacted any business, a certain order\r\n(_ordo tribuum_) was observed, in which they were called upon to give\r\ntheir votes. The first in the order of succession was the Suburana,\r\nand the last the Arniensis. Any person belonging to a tribe had in\r\nimportant documents to add to his own name that of his tribe, in the\r\nablative case. Whether the local tribes, as they were established by\r\nthe constitution of Servius Tullius, contained only the plebeians,\r\nor included the patricians also, is a point on which the opinions of\r\nmodern scholars are divided: but it appears most probable that down\r\nto the decemviral legislation the tribes and their assemblies were\r\nentirely plebeian. From the time of the decemviral legislation, the\r\npatricians and their clients were undoubtedly incorporated in the\r\ntribes. Respecting the assemblies of the tribes, see COMITIA TRIBUTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬBŪTUM, a tax which was partly applied to cover the expenses of\r\nwar, and partly those of the fortifications of the city. The usual\r\namount of the tax was one for every thousand of a man’s fortune,\r\nthough in the time of Cato it was raised to three in a thousand. The\r\ntributum was not a property-tax in the strict sense of the word, for\r\nthe accounts respecting the plebeian debtors clearly imply, that the\r\ndebts were not deducted in the valuation of a person’s property,\r\nso that he had to pay the tributum upon property which was not his\r\nown, but which he owed, and for which he had consequently to pay the\r\ninterest as well. It was a direct tax upon objects without any regard\r\nto their produce, like a land or house-tax, which indeed formed the\r\nmain part of it. That which seems to have made it most oppressive,\r\nwas its constant fluctuation. It was raised according to the regions\r\nor tribes instituted by Servius Tullius, and by the tribunes of these\r\ntribes, subsequently called tribuni aerarii. It was not, like the\r\nother branches of the public revenue, let out to farm, but being\r\nfixed in money it was raised by the tribunes, unless (as was the case\r\nafter the custom of giving pay to the soldiers was introduced) the\r\nsoldiers, like the knights, demanded it from the persons themselves\r\nwho were bound to pay it. [AES EQUESTRE and HORDEARIUM.] When this\r\ntax was to be paid, what sum was to be raised, and what portion of\r\nevery thousand asses of the census, were matters upon which the\r\nsenate alone had to decide. But when it was decreed, the people\r\nmight refuse to pay it when they thought it too heavy, or unfairly\r\ndistributed, or hoped to gain some other advantage by the refusal. In\r\nlater times the senate sometimes left its regulation to the censors,\r\nwho often fixed it very arbitrarily. No citizen was exempt from it,\r\nbut we find that the priests, augurs, and pontiffs made attempts to\r\nget rid of it: but this was only an abuse, which did not last. After\r\nthe war with Macedonia (B.C. 147), when the Roman treasury was filled\r\nwith the revenues accruing from conquests and from the provinces,\r\nthe Roman citizens became exempted from paying the tributum, and\r\nthis state of things lasted down to the consulship of Hirtius and\r\nPansa (43 B.C.), when the tributum was again levied, on account of\r\nthe exhausted state of the aerarium. After this time it was imposed\r\naccording to the discretion of the emperors. Respecting the tributum\r\npaid by conquered countries and cities, see VECTIGALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICLĪNĬUM, the dining-room of a Roman house, the position of\r\nwhich, relatively to the other parts of the house, is seen in the\r\n“house of the Tragic poet” (see p. 144). It was of an oblong shape,\r\nand was twice as long as it was broad. The superintendence of\r\nthe dining-room in a great house was intrusted to a slave called\r\n_tricliniarcha_, who, through other slaves, took care that everything\r\nwas kept and proceeded in proper order. A _triclinium_ generally\r\ncontained three couches, and as the usual number of persons occupying\r\neach couch was three, the triclinium afforded accommodation for a\r\nparty of nine. Sometimes, however, as many as four lay on each of the\r\ncouches. Each man in order to feed himself lay flat upon his breast\r\nor nearly so, and stretched out his hand towards the table; but\r\nafterwards, when his hunger was satisfied, he turned upon his left\r\nside, leaning on his elbow. To this Horace alludes in describing a\r\nperson sated with a particular dish, and turning in order to repose\r\nupon his elbow. (_Sat._ ii. 4, 39.) We find the relative positions\r\nof two persons who lay next to one another, commonly expressed by\r\nthe prepositions _super_ or _supra_, and _infra_. A passage of Livy\r\n(xxxix. 43), in which he relates the cruel conduct of the consul L.\r\nQuintius Flamininus, shows that _infra aliquem cubare_ was the same\r\nas _in sinu alicujus cubare_, and consequently that each person was\r\nconsidered as _below_ him to whose breast his own head approached. On\r\nthis principle we are enabled to explain the denominations both of\r\nthe three couches, and of the three places on each couch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                  lectus medius\r\n                 +-------------+\r\n                 |      m   s  |\r\n                 |  i   e   u  |\r\n                 |  m   d   m  |\r\n                 |  u   i   m  |\r\n                 |  s   u   u  |\r\n                 |      s   s  |\r\n       +---------+-------------+---------+\r\n  l    |         |  6   5   4  |         | l s\r\n  e  i | summus  |7           3|  imus   | e u\r\n  c  m |         |             |         | c m\r\n  t  u | medius  |8           2| medius  | t m\r\n  u  s |         |             |         | u u\r\n  s    |  imus   |9           1| summus  | s s\r\n       +---------+             +---------+\r\n]\r\n\r\nSupposing the annexed arrangement to represent the plan of a\r\ntriclinium, it is evident that, as each guest reclined on his left\r\nside, the countenances of all when in this position were directed,\r\nfirst, from No. 1 towards No. 3, then from No. 4 towards No. 6, and\r\nlastly, from No. 7 towards No. 9; that the guest No. 1 lay, in the\r\nsense explained, _above_ No. 2, No. 3 _below_ No. 2, and so of the\r\nrest; and that, going in the same direction, the couch to the right\r\nhand was _above_ the others, and the couch to the left hand _below_\r\nthe others.

[FUSCINA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬENS. [AS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIĒRARCHĬA (τριήραρχια), one of the extraordinary war services or\r\nliturgies at Athens, the object of which was to provide for the\r\nequipment and maintenance of the ships of war belonging to the\r\nstate. The persons who were charged with it were called trierarchs\r\n(τριήραρχοι), as being the captains of triremes, though the name\r\nwas also applied to persons who bore the same charge in other\r\nvessels. It existed from very early times in connection with the\r\nforty-eight naucraries of Solon, and the fifty of Clisthenes: each\r\nof which corporations appears to have been obliged to equip and man\r\na vessel. [NAUCRARIA.] Under the constitution of Clisthenes the\r\nten tribes were at first severally charged with five vessels. This\r\ncharge was of course superseded by the later forms of the hierarchy.\r\nThe state furnished the ship, and either the whole or part of the\r\nship’s rigging and furniture, and also pay and provisions for the\r\nsailors. The trierarchs were bound to keep in repair the ship and its\r\nfurniture, and were frequently put to great expense in paying the\r\nsailors and supplying them with provisions, when the state did not\r\nsupply sufficient money for the purpose. Moreover, some trierarchs,\r\nwhether from ambitious or patriotic motives, put themselves to\r\nunnecessary expense in fitting out and rigging their ships, from\r\nwhich the state derived an advantage. The average expense of the\r\ntrierarchy was 50 minae. In ancient times one person bore the whole\r\ncharge of the trierarchy, afterwards it was customary for two persons\r\nto share it, who were then called _syntrierarchs_ (συντριήραρχοι).\r\nWhen this practice was first introduced is not known, but it was\r\nperhaps about the year 412 B.C., after the defeat of the Athenians\r\nin Sicily, when the union of two persons for the choregia was first\r\npermitted. The syntrierarchy, however, did not entirely supersede\r\nthe older and single form, being only meant as a relief in case of\r\nemergency, when there was not a sufficient number of wealthy citizens\r\nto bear the expense singly. In the case of a syntrierarchy the two\r\ntrierarchs commanded their vessel in turn, six months each, according\r\nas they agreed between themselves.--The third form of the trierarchy\r\nwas connected with, or suggested by, the syntrierarchy. In B.C. 358,\r\nthe Athenians were unable to procure a sufficient number of legally\r\nappointed trierarchs, and accordingly they summoned volunteers. This,\r\nhowever, was but a temporary expedient; and as the actual system\r\nwas not adequate to the public wants, they determined to manage the\r\ntrierarchy somewhat in the same way as the property-tax (_eisphora_),\r\nnamely, by classes or symmoriae, according to the law of Periander\r\npassed in B.C. 358, and which was the primary and original enactment\r\non the subject. With this view 1200 _synteleis_ (συντελεῖς) or\r\npartners were appointed, who were probably the wealthiest individuals\r\nof the state, according to the census or valuation. These were\r\ndivided into 20 _symmoriae_ (συμμορίαι) or classes; out of which\r\na number of persons (σώματα) joined for the equipment or rather\r\nthe maintenance and management of a ship, under the title of a\r\n_synteleia_ (συντέλεια) or union. To every ship there was generally\r\nassigned a _synteleia_ of fifteen persons of different degrees of\r\nwealth, as we may suppose, so that four ships only were provided\r\nfor by each symmoria of sixty persons. It appears, however, that\r\nbefore Demosthenes carried a new law on this subject (B.C. 340), it\r\nhad been customary for _sixteen_ persons to unite in a synteleia or\r\ncompany for a ship, who bore the burden in equal shares. This being\r\nthe case, it follows either that the members of the symmoriae had\r\nbeen by that time raised from 1200 to 1280, or that some alterations\r\nhad taken place in their internal arrangements, of which no account\r\nhas come down to us. The superintendence of the whole system was in\r\nthe hands of the 300 wealthiest members, who were therefore called\r\nthe “leaders of the symmoriae” (ἡγεμόνες τῶν συμμοριῶν), on whom\r\nthe burdens of the trierarchy chiefly fell, or rather ought to have\r\nfallen. The services performed by individuals under this system\r\nappear to have been the same as before: the state still provided\r\nthe ship’s tackle, and the only duty then of the trierarchs under\r\nthis system was to keep their vessels in the same repair and order\r\nas they received them. But even from this they managed to escape:\r\nfor the wealthiest members, who had to serve for their synteleia,\r\nlet out their trierarchies for a talent, and received that amount\r\nfrom their partners (συντελεῖς), so that in reality they paid next\r\nto nothing, or, at any rate, not what they ought to have done,\r\nconsidering that the trierarchy was a ground of exemption from\r\nother liturgies.--To remedy these abuses Demosthenes carried a law\r\nwhen he was the ἐπιστάτης τοῦ ναυτικοῦ, or the superintendent of\r\nthe Athenian navy, thereby introducing the _Fourth form_ of the\r\ntrierarchy. The provisions of the law were as follows: The naval\r\nservices required from every citizen were to depend upon and be\r\nproportional to his property, or rather to his taxable capital, as\r\nregistered for the symmoriae of the property-tax, the rate being\r\none trireme for every ten talents of taxable capital, up to three\r\ntriremes and one auxiliary vessel (ὑπηρέσιον) for the largest\r\nproperties; _i.e._ no person, however rich, could be required to\r\nfurnish more. Those who had not ten talents in taxable capital were\r\nto club together in synteleiae till they had made up that amount.\r\nBy this law great changes were effected. All persons paying taxes\r\nwere rated in proportion to their property, so that the poor were\r\nbenefited by it, and the state likewise: for, as Demosthenes says,\r\nthose who had formerly contributed one-sixteenth to the trierarchy of\r\none ship were now trierarchs of two, in which case they must either\r\nhave served by proxy, or done duty in successive years. He adds, that\r\nthe consequences were highly beneficial. We do not know the amount\r\nof property which rendered a man liable to serve a trierarchy or\r\nsyntrierarchy, but we read of no instance of liability arising from\r\na property of less value than 500 minae. The appointment to serve\r\nunder the first and second forms of the trierarchy was made by the\r\nstrategi, and in case any person was appointed to serve a trierarchy,\r\nand thought that any one else (not called upon) was better able\r\nto bear it than himself, he offered the latter an exchange of his\r\nproperty [ANTIDOSIS] subject to the burden of the trierarchy. In\r\ncases of extreme hardship, persons became suppliants to the people,\r\nor fled to the altar of Artemis at Munychia. If not ready in time,\r\nthey were sometimes liable to imprisonment. On the contrary, whoever\r\ngot his ship ready first was to be rewarded with the “crown of\r\nthe trierarchy;” so that in this way considerable emulation and\r\ncompetition were produced. Moreover, the trierarchs were ὑπεύθυνοι,\r\nor liable to be called to account for their expenditure; though they\r\napplied their own property to the service of the state. It has been\r\nalready stated that the trierarchy was a ground of exemption from the\r\nother liturgies, any of which, indeed, gave an exemption, from all\r\nthe rest during the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬNUNDĬNUM. [NUNDINAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIŌBŎLON (τριώβολον), the fee of three obols, which the Athenian\r\ndicasts received. [DICASTAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬPOS (τρίπους), a tripod, _i.e._ any utensil or article of\r\nfurniture supported upon three feet. More especially (1) A\r\nthree-legged table.--(2) A pot or caldron, used for boiling meat,\r\nand either raised upon a three-legged stand of bronze, or made\r\nwith its three feet in the same piece.--(3) A bronze altar, not\r\ndiffering probably in its original form from the tall tripod caldron\r\nalready described. It was from a tripod that the Pythian priestess\r\nat Delphi gave responses. [CORTINA.] The celebrity of this tripod\r\nproduced innumerable imitations of it, which were made to be used in\r\nsacrifice, and still more frequently to be presented to the treasury\r\nboth in that place and in many other Greek temples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tripod of Apollo at Delphi. (Böttiger’s Amalthea, vol.\r\ni. p. 119.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬPŬDĬUM. [AUSPICIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIRĒMIS. [NAVIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬUMPHUS (θρίαμβος), a solemn procession, in which a victorious\r\ngeneral entered the city in a chariot drawn by four horses. He was\r\npreceded by the captives and spoils taken in war, was followed by\r\nhis troops, and after passing in state along the Via Sacra, ascended\r\nthe Capitol to offer sacrifice in the temple of Jupiter. From the\r\nbeginning of the republic down to the extinction of liberty a regular\r\ntriumph (_justus triumphus_) was recognised as the summit of military\r\nglory, and was the cherished object of ambition to every Roman\r\ngeneral. A triumph might be granted for successful achievements\r\neither by land or sea, but the latter were comparatively so rare\r\nthat we shall for the present defer the consideration of the naval\r\ntriumph. After any decisive battle had been won, or a province\r\nsubdued by a series of successful operations, the imperator forwarded\r\nto the senate a laurel-wreathed dispatch (_literae laureatae_),\r\ncontaining an account of his exploits. If the intelligence\r\nproved satisfactory, the senate decreed a public thanksgiving.\r\n[SUPPLICATIO.] After the war was concluded, the general with his\r\narmy repaired to Rome, or ordered his army to meet him there on a\r\ngiven day, but did not enter the city. A meeting of the senate was\r\nheld without the walls, usually in the temple either of Bellona or\r\nApollo, that he might have an opportunity of urging his pretensions\r\nin person, and these were then scrutinised and discussed with the\r\nmost jealous care. The following rules were for the most part rigidly\r\nenforced, although the senate assumed the discretionary power of\r\nrelaxing them in special cases. 1. That no one could be permitted\r\nto triumph unless he had held the office of dictator, of consul,\r\nor of praetor. The honours granted to Pompey, who triumphed in his\r\n24th year (B.C. 81) before he had held any of the great offices of\r\nstate, and again ten years afterwards, while still a simple eques,\r\nwere altogether unprecedented. 2. That the magistrate should have\r\nbeen actually in office both when the victory was gained and when\r\nthe triumph was to be celebrated. This regulation was insisted upon\r\nonly during the earlier ages of the commonwealth. Its violation\r\ncommenced with Q. Publilius Philo, the first person to whom the\r\nsenate ever granted a _prorogatio imperii_ after the termination\r\nof a magistracy, and thenceforward proconsuls and propraetors were\r\npermitted to triumph without question. 3. That the war should have\r\nbeen prosecuted or the battle fought under the auspices and in the\r\nprovince and with the troops of the general seeking the triumph.\r\nThus if a victory was gained by the legatus of a general who was\r\nabsent from the army, the honour of it did not belong to the former,\r\nbut to the latter, inasmuch as he had the auspices. 4. That at\r\nleast 5000 of the enemy should have been slain in a single battle,\r\nthat the advantage should have been positive, and not merely a\r\ncompensation for some previous disaster, and that the loss on the\r\npart of the Romans should have been small compared with that of their\r\nadversaries. But still we find many instances of triumphs granted\r\nfor general results, without reference to the numbers slain in any\r\none engagement. 5. That the war should have been a legitimate\r\ncontest against public foes, and not a civil contest. Hence Catulus\r\ncelebrated no triumph over Lepidus, nor Antonius over Catiline, nor\r\nCinna and Marius over their antagonists of the Sullan party, nor\r\nCaesar after Pharsalia; and when he did subsequently triumph after\r\nhis victory over the sons of Pompey, it caused universal disgust. 6.\r\nThat the dominion of the state should have been extended, and not\r\nmerely something previously lost regained. The absolute acquisition\r\nof territory does not appear to have been essential. 7. That the war\r\nshould have been brought to a conclusion and the province reduced to\r\na state of peace, so as to permit of the army being withdrawn, the\r\npresence of the victorious soldiers being considered indispensable\r\nin a triumph. The senate claimed the exclusive right of deliberating\r\nupon all these points, and giving or withholding the honour sought,\r\nand they for the most part exercised the privilege without question,\r\nexcept in times of great political excitement. The sovereignty of the\r\npeople, however, in this matter was asserted at a very early date,\r\nand a triumph is said to have been voted by the tribes to Valerius\r\nand Horatius, the consuls of B.C. 446, in direct opposition to the\r\nresolution of the fathers, and in a similar manner to C. Marcius\r\nRutilus the first plebeian dictator, while L. Postumius Megellus,\r\nconsul B.C. 294, celebrated a triumph, although resisted by the\r\nsenate and seven out of the ten tribunes. Nay, more, we read of a\r\ncertain Appius Claudius, consul B.C. 143, who having persisted in\r\ncelebrating a triumph in defiance of both the senate and people, was\r\naccompanied by his daughter (or sister) Claudia, a vestal virgin,\r\nand by her interposition saved from being dragged from his chariot\r\nby a tribune. A disappointed general, however, seldom ventured to\r\nresort to such violent measures, but satisfied himself with going\r\nthrough the forms on the Alban Mount, a practice first introduced by\r\nC. Papirius Maso. If the senate gave their consent, they at the same\r\ntime voted a sum of money towards defraying the necessary expenses,\r\nand one of the tribunes _ex auctoritate senatus_ applied for a\r\nplebiscitum to permit the imperator to retain his imperium on the day\r\nwhen he entered the city. This last form could not be dispensed with\r\neither in an ovation or a triumph, because the imperium conferred\r\nby the comitia curiata did not include the city itself, and when a\r\ngeneral had once gone forth _paludatus_, his military power ceased\r\nas soon as he re-entered the gates, unless the general law had been\r\npreviously suspended by a special enactment; and in this manner the\r\nresolution of the senate was, as it were, ratified by the plebs. For\r\nthis reason no one desiring a triumph ever entered the city until\r\nthe question was decided, since by so doing he would ipso facto\r\nhave forfeited all claim. We have a remarkable example of this in\r\nthe case of Cicero, who after his return from Cilicia lingered in\r\nthe vicinity of Rome day after day, and dragged about his lictors\r\nfrom one place to another, without entering the city, in the vain\r\nhope of a triumph.--In later times these pageants were marshalled\r\nwith extraordinary pomp and splendour, and presented a most gorgeous\r\nspectacle. Minute details would necessarily be different according\r\nto circumstances, but the general arrangements were as follows. The\r\ntemples were all thrown open, garlands of flowers decorated every\r\nshrine and image, and incense smoked on every altar. Meanwhile the\r\nimperator called an assembly of his soldiers, delivered an oration\r\ncommending their valour, and concluded by distributing rewards to\r\nthe most distinguished, and a sum of money to each individual, the\r\namount depending on the value of the spoils. He then ascended his\r\ntriumphal car and advanced to the Porta Triumphalis, where he was\r\nmet by the whole body of the senate headed by the magistrates. The\r\nprocession then defiled in the following order. 1. The senate headed\r\nby the magistrates. 2. A body of trumpeters. 3. A train of carriages\r\nand frames laden with spoils, those articles which were especially\r\nremarkable either on account of their beauty or rarity being disposed\r\nin such a manner as to be seen distinctly by the crowd. Boards were\r\nborne aloft on fercula, on which were painted in large letters the\r\nnames of vanquished nations and countries. Here, too, models were\r\nexhibited in ivory or wood of the cities and forts captured, and\r\npictures of the mountains, rivers, and other great natural features\r\nof the subjugated region, with appropriate inscriptions. Gold and\r\nsilver in coin or bullion, arms, weapons, and horse furniture of\r\nevery description, statues, pictures, vases, and other works of art,\r\nprecious stones, elaborately wrought and richly embroidered stuffs,\r\nand every object which could be regarded as valuable or curious. 4.\r\nA body of flute players. 5. The white bulls or oxen destined for\r\nsacrifice, with gilded horns, decorated with infulae and serta,\r\nattended by the slaughtering priests with their implements, and\r\nfollowed by the Camilli bearing in their hands paterae and other holy\r\nvessels and instruments. 6. Elephants or any other strange animals,\r\nnatives of the conquered districts. 7. The arms and insignia of the\r\nleaders of the foe. 8. The leaders themselves, and such of their\r\nkindred as had been taken prisoners, followed by the whole band of\r\ninferior captives in fetters. 9. The coronae and other tributes of\r\nrespect and gratitude bestowed on the imperator by allied kings and\r\nstates. 10. The lictors of the imperator in single file, their fasces\r\nwreathed with laurel. 11. The imperator himself in a circular chariot\r\nof a peculiar form, drawn by four horses, which were sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, white. He was attired in a gold-embroidered robe\r\n(_toga picta_) and flowered tunic (_tunica palmata_): he bore in his\r\nright hand a laurel bough, and in his left a sceptre; his brows were\r\nencircled with a wreath of Delphic laurel, in addition to which in\r\nancient times, his body was painted bright red. He was accompanied in\r\nhis chariot by his children of tender years, and sometimes by very\r\ndear or highly honoured friends, while behind him stood a public\r\nslave, holding over his head a golden Etruscan crown ornamented with\r\njewels. The presence of a slave in such a place at such a time seems\r\nto have been intended to avert _invidia_ and the influence of the\r\nevil eye, and for the same purpose a fascinum, a little bell, and a\r\nscourge were attached to the vehicle. Tertullian tells us, that the\r\nslave ever and anon whispered in the ear of the imperator the warning\r\nwords _Respice post te, hominem memento te_, but this statement is\r\nnot confirmed by any earlier writer. 12. Behind the chariot or on\r\nthe horses which drew it rode the grown-up sons of the imperator,\r\ntogether with the legati, the tribuni, and the equites, all on\r\nhorseback. 13. The rear was brought up by the whole body of the\r\ninfantry in marching order, their spears adorned with laurel, some\r\nshouting Io Triumphe, and singing hymns to the gods, while others\r\nproclaimed the praises of their leader or indulged in keen sarcasms\r\nand coarse ribaldry at his expense, for the most perfect freedom of\r\nspeech was granted and exercised. Just as the pomp was ascending the\r\nCapitoline hill, some of the hostile chiefs were led aside into the\r\nadjoining prison and put to death, a custom so barbarous that we\r\ncould scarcely believe that it existed in a civilised age, were it\r\nnot attested by the most unquestionable evidence. Pompey, indeed,\r\nrefrained from perpetrating this atrocity in his third triumph, and\r\nAurelian on like occasion spared Zenobia, but these are quoted as\r\nexceptions to the general rule. When it was announced that these\r\nmurders had been completed, the victims were then sacrificed, an\r\noffering from the spoils was presented to Jupiter, the laurel wreath\r\nwas deposited in the lap of the god, the imperator was entertained\r\nat a public feast along with his friends in the temple, and returned\r\nhome in the evening preceded by torches and pipes, and escorted by a\r\ncrowd of citizens. The whole of the proceedings, generally speaking,\r\nwere brought to a close in one day; but when the quantity of plunder\r\nwas very great, and the troops very numerous, a longer period was\r\nrequired for the exhibition, and thus the triumph of Flaminius\r\ncontinued for three days in succession. But the glories of the\r\nimperator did not end with the show, nor even with his life. It was\r\ncustomary (we know not if the practice was invariable) to provide him\r\nat the public expense with a site for a house, such mansions being\r\nstyled _triumphales domus_. After death his kindred were permitted\r\nto deposit his ashes within the walls, and laurel-wreathed statues\r\nstanding erect in triumphal cars, displayed in the vestibulum of\r\nthe family mansion, transmitted his fame to posterity.--A TRIUMPHUS\r\nNAVALIS appears to have differed in no respect from an ordinary\r\ntriumph, except that it must have been upon a smaller scale, and\r\nwould be characterised by the exhibition of beaks of ships and\r\nother nautical trophies. The earliest upon record was granted to C.\r\nDuillius, who laid the foundation of the supremacy of Rome by sea\r\nin the first Punic war; and so elated was he by his success, that\r\nduring the rest of his life, whenever he returned home at night from\r\nsupper, he caused flutes to sound and torches to be borne before\r\nhim. A second naval triumph was celebrated by Lutatius Catulus for\r\nhis victory off the Insulae Aegates, B.C. 241; a third by Q. Fabius\r\nLabeo, B.C. 189, over the Cretans; and a fourth by C. Octavius\r\nover King Perseus, without captives and without spoils.--TRIUMPHUS\r\nCASTRENSIS was a procession of the soldiers through the camp in\r\nhonour of a tribunus or some officer inferior to the general, who\r\nhad performed a brilliant exploit. After the extinction of freedom,\r\nthe emperor being considered as the commander-in-chief of all the\r\narmies of the state, every military achievement was understood to\r\nbe performed under his auspices, and hence, according to the forms\r\nof even the ancient constitution, he alone had a legitimate claim\r\nto a triumph. This principle was soon fully recognised and acted\r\nupon; for although Antonius had granted triumphs to his legati, and\r\nhis example had been freely followed by Augustus in the early part\r\nof his career, yet after the year B.C. 14, he entirely discontinued\r\nthe practice, and from that time forward triumphs were rarely, if\r\never, conceded to any except members of the imperial family. But to\r\ncompensate in some degree for what was then taken away, the custom\r\nwas introduced of bestowing what were termed _Triumphalia Ornamenta_,\r\nthat is, permission to receive the titles bestowed upon and to appear\r\nin public with the robes worn by the imperatores of the commonwealth\r\nwhen they triumphed, and to bequeath to descendants triumphal\r\nstatues. These _triumphalia ornamenta_ are said to have been first\r\nbestowed upon Agrippa or upon Tiberius, and ever after were a common\r\nmark of the favour of the prince.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Triumphal Procession. (Zoega, Bassi-rilievi, tav. 9,\r\n76.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRĬUMVĬRI, or TRESVĬRI, were either ordinary magistrates or officers,\r\nor else extraordinary commissioners, who were frequently appointed\r\nat Rome to execute any public office. The following is a list of the\r\nmost important of both classes.\r\n\r\n1. TRIUMVIRI AGRO DIVIDUNDO. [TRIUMVIRI COLONIAE DEDUCENDAE.]\r\n\r\n2. TRIUMVIRI CAPITALES were regular magistrates, first appointed\r\nabout B.C. 292. They were elected by the people, the comitia being\r\nheld by the praetor. They succeeded to many of the functions of the\r\nQuaestores Parricidii. [QUAESTOR.] It was their duty to inquire into\r\nall capital crimes, and to receive informations respecting such, and\r\nconsequently they apprehended and committed to prison all criminals\r\nwhom they detected. In conjunction with the aediles, they had to\r\npreserve the public peace, to prevent all unlawful assemblies, &c.\r\nThey enforced the payment of fines due to the state. They had the\r\ncare of public prisons, and carried into effect the sentence of the\r\nlaw upon criminals. In these points they resembled the magistracy of\r\nthe Eleven at Athens.\r\n\r\n4. TRIUMVIRI COLONIAE DEDUCENDAE were persons appointed to\r\nsuperintend the formation of a colony. They are spoken of under\r\nCOLONIA, p. 99, _b_. Since they had besides to superintend the\r\ndistribution of the land to the colonists, we find them also called\r\n_Triumviri Coloniae Deducendae Agroque Dividundo_, and sometimes\r\nsimply _Triumviri Agro Dando_.\r\n\r\n5. TRIUMVIRI EPULONES. [EPULONES.]\r\n\r\n6. TRIUMVIRI EQUITUM TURMAS RECOGNOSCENDI, or LEGENDIS EQUITUM\r\nDECURIIS, were magistrates first appointed by Augustus to revise the\r\nlists of the equites, and to admit persons into the order. This was\r\nformerly part of the duties of the censors.\r\n\r\n7. TRIUMVIRI MENSARII. [MENSARII.]\r\n\r\n8. TRIUMVIRI MONETALES. [MONETA.]\r\n\r\n9. TRIUMVIRI NOCTURNI were magistrates elected annually, whose chief\r\nduty it was to prevent fires by night, and for this purpose they had\r\nto go round the city during the night (_vigilias circumire_). If they\r\nneglected their duty they appear to have been accused before the\r\npeople by the tribunes of the plebs. The time at which this office\r\nwas instituted is unknown, but it must have been previously to the\r\nyear B.C. 304. Augustus transferred their duties to the Praefectus\r\nVigilum. [PRAEFECTUS VIGILUM.]\r\n\r\n10. TRIUMVIRI REFICIENDIS AEDIBUS, extraordinary officers elected\r\nin the Comitia Tributa in the time of the second Punic war, were\r\nappointed for the purpose of repairing and rebuilding certain temples.\r\n\r\n11. TRIUMVIRI REIPUBLICAE CONSTITUENDAE. When the supreme power\r\nwas shared between Caesar (Octavianus), Antony, and Lepidus, they\r\nadministered the affairs of the state under the title of _Triumviri\r\nReipublicae Constituendae_. This office was conferred upon them in\r\nB.C. 43, for five years; and on the expiration of the term, in B.C.\r\n38, was conferred upon them again, in B.C. 37, for five years more.\r\nThe coalition between Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, in B.C. 60,\r\nis usually called the first triumvirate, and that between Octavianus,\r\nAntony, and Lepidus, the second; but it must be borne in mind that\r\nthe former never bore the title of triumviri, nor were invested with\r\nany office under that name, whereas the latter were recognised as\r\nregular magistrates under the above-mentioned title.\r\n\r\n12. TRIUMVIRI SACRIS CONQUIRENDIS DONISQUE PERSIGNANDIS,\r\nextraordinary officers elected in the Comitia Tributa in the time of\r\nthe second Punic war, seem to have had to take care that all property\r\ngiven or consecrated to the gods was applied to that purpose.\r\n\r\n13. TRIUMVIRI SENATUS LEGENDI were magistrates appointed by Augustus\r\nto admit persons into the senate. This was previously the duty of the\r\ncensors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRŎCHUS (τροχός), a hoop. The Greek hoop was a bronze ring, and had\r\nsometimes bells attached to it. It was impelled by means of a hook\r\nwith a wooden handle, called _clavis_, and ἐλατήρ. From the Greeks\r\nthis custom passed to the Romans, who consequently adopted the Greek\r\nterm. The following woodcuts from gems exhibit naked youths trundling\r\nthe hoop by means of the hook or key. They are accompanied by the jar\r\nof oil and the laurel branch, the signs of effort and of victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trochi, Hoops. (From ancient Gems.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTROJAE LŪDUS. [CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRŎPAEUM (τρόπαιον, _Att._ τροπαῖον), a trophy, a sign and memorial\r\nof victory, which was erected on the field of battle where the enemy\r\nhad turned (τρέπω, τρόπη) to flight; and in case of a victory gained\r\nat sea, on the nearest land. The expression for raising or erecting\r\na trophy is τροπαῖον στῆσαι or στήσασθαι, to which may be added ἀπὸ\r\nor κατὰ τῶν πολεμίων. When the battle was not decisive, or each party\r\nconsidered it had some claims to the victory, both erected trophies.\r\nTrophies usually consisted of the arms, shields, helmets, &c. of the\r\nenemy that were defeated; and these were placed on the trunk of a\r\ntree, which was fixed on some elevation. The trophy was consecrated\r\nto some divinity, with an inscription (ἐπίγραμμα), recording the\r\nnames of the victors and of the defeated party; whence trophies were\r\nregarded as inviolable, which even the enemy were not permitted to\r\nremove. Sometimes, however, a people destroyed a trophy, if they\r\nconsidered that the enemy had erected it without sufficient cause.\r\nThat rankling and hostile feelings might not be perpetuated by the\r\ncontinuance of a trophy, it seems to have been originally part of\r\nGreek international law that trophies should be made only of wood,\r\nand not of stone or metal, and that they should not be repaired when\r\ndecayed. It was not, however, uncommon to erect trophies of metal.\r\nPausanias speaks of several which he saw in Greece. The trophies\r\nerected to commemorate naval victories were usually ornamented with\r\nthe beaks or acroteria of ships [ACROTERIUM; ROSTRA]; and were\r\ngenerally consecrated to Poseidon or Neptune. Sometimes a whole ship\r\nwas placed as a trophy. The Romans, in early times, never erected any\r\ntrophies on the field of battle, but carried home the spoils taken in\r\nbattle, with which they decorated the public buildings, and also the\r\nprivate houses of individuals. [SPOLIA.] Subsequently, however, the\r\nRomans adopted the Greek practice of raising trophies on the field\r\nof battle. The first trophies of this kind were erected by Domitius\r\nAhenobarbus and Fabius Maximus in B.C. 121, after their conquest of\r\nthe Allobroges, when they built at the junction of the Rhone and the\r\nIsara towers of white stone, upon which trophies were placed adorned\r\nwith the spoils of the enemy. Pompey also raised trophies on the\r\nPyrenees after his victories in Spain; Julius Caesar did the same\r\nnear Ziela, after his victory over Pharnaces; and Drusus, near the\r\nElbe, to commemorate his victory over the Germans. Still, however, it\r\nwas more common to erect some memorial of the victory at Rome than on\r\nthe field of battle. The trophies raised by Marius to commemorate his\r\nvictories over Jugurtha and the Cimbri and Teutoni, which were cast\r\ndown by Sulla, and restored by Julius Caesar, must have been in the\r\ncity. In the later times of the republic, and under the empire, the\r\nerection of triumphal arches was the most common way of commemorating\r\na victory, many of which remain to the present day. [ARCUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trophy of Augustus. (Museo Capitolino, vol i. tav. 5.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTROSSŬLI. [EQUITES, p. 157, _a_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRŬA, _dim._ TRULLA (τορύνη), derived from τρύω, τόρω, &c., to\r\nperforate; a large and flat spoon or ladle, pierced with holes; a\r\ntrowel. The annexed woodcut represents such a ladle. The _trulla\r\nvinaria_ seems to have been a species of colander [COLUM], used as a\r\nwine-strainer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trua. (From the House of Pansa at Pompeii.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRŬTĬNA (τρυτάνη), a general term, including both _libra_, a balance,\r\nand _statera_, a steelyard. Payments were originally made by\r\nweighing, not by counting. Hence a balance (_trutina_) was preserved\r\nin the temple of Saturn at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTŬBA (σάλπιγξ), a bronze trumpet, distinguished from the _cornu_ by\r\nbeing straight while the latter was curved. [CORNU.] The tuba was\r\nemployed in war for signals of every description, at the games and\r\npublic festivals, and also at the last rites to the dead: those who\r\nsounded the trumpet at funerals were termed _siticines_, and used an\r\ninstrument of a peculiar form. The tones of the tuba are represented\r\nas of a harsh and fear-inspiring character. The invention of the tuba\r\nis usually ascribed by ancient writers to the Etruscans. It has been\r\nremarked that Homer never introduces the σάλπιγξ in his narrative\r\nexcept in comparisons, which leads us to infer that, although known\r\nin his time, it had been but recently introduced into Greece; and it\r\nis certain that, notwithstanding its eminently martial character, it\r\nwas not until a late period used in the armies of the leading states.\r\nBy the Greek tragedians its Tuscan origin is fully recognised.\r\nAccording to one account it was first fabricated for the Tyrrhenians\r\nby Athena, who in consequence was worshipped by the Argives under the\r\ntitle of Σάλπιγξ, while at Rome the _tubilustrium_, or purification\r\nof sacred trumpets, was performed on the last day of the Quinquatrus.\r\n[QUINQUATRUS.] There appears to have been no essential difference in\r\nform between the Greek and Roman or Tyrrhenian trumpets. Both were\r\nlong, straight, bronze tubes, gradually increasing in diameter, and\r\nterminating in a bell-shaped aperture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soldiers blowing Tubae and Cornua. (From Column of\r\nTrajan.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTŬBĬLUSTRIUM. [QUINQUATRUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTULLIĀNUM. [CARCER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTŬMULTUĀRĬI. [TUMULTUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTŬMULTUS, the name given to a sudden or dangerous war in Italy or\r\nCisalpine Gaul, and the word was supposed by the ancients to be a\r\ncontraction of _timor multus_. It was, however, sometimes applied\r\nto a sudden or dangerous war elsewhere; but this does not appear to\r\nhave been a correct use of the word. Cicero says that there might\r\nbe a war without a tumultus, but not a tumultus without a war; but\r\nit must be recollected that the word was also applied to any sudden\r\nalarm respecting a war; whence we find a tumultus often spoken of\r\nas of less importance than a war, because the results were of less\r\nconsequence, though the fear might have been much greater than in a\r\nregular war. In the case of a tumultus there was a cessation from\r\nall business (_justitium_), and all citizens were obliged to enlist\r\nwithout regard being had to the exemptions (_vacationes_) from\r\nmilitary service, which were enjoyed at other times. As there was not\r\ntime to enlist the soldiers in the regular manner, the magistrate who\r\nwas appointed to command the army displayed two banners (_vexilla_)\r\nfrom the Capitol, one red, to summon the infantry, and the other\r\ngreen, to summon the cavalry, and said, _Qui rempublicam salvam vult,\r\nme sequatur_. Those that assembled took the military oath together,\r\ninstead of one by one, as was the usual practice, whence they were\r\ncalled _conjurati_, and their service _conjuratio_. Soldiers enlisted\r\nin this way were termed _Tumultuarii_ or _Subitarii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Doric Chiton. (From a Bas-relief in the British\r\nMuseum.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ionic Chiton. (From a Statue in the British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nTŬNĬCA (χιτών, _dim._ χιτωνίσκος, χιτώνιον), an under-garment. (1)\r\nGREEK. The chiton was the only kind of ἔνδυμα, or under-garment worn\r\nby the Greeks. Of this there were two kinds, the Dorian and Ionian.\r\nThe Dorian chiton, as worn by males, was a short woollen shirt,\r\nwithout sleeves; the Ionian was a long linen garment, with sleeves.\r\nThe former seems to have been originally worn throughout the whole\r\nof Greece; the latter was brought over to Greece by the Ionians of\r\nAsia. The Ionic chiton was commonly worn at Athens by men during the\r\nPersian wars, but it appears to have entirely gone out of fashion for\r\nthe male sex about the time of Pericles, from which time the Dorian\r\nchiton was the under-garment universally adopted by men through the\r\nwhole of Greece. The distinction between the Doric and Ionic chiton\r\nstill continued in the dress of women. The Spartan virgins only\r\nwore this one garment, and had no upper kind of clothing, whence it\r\nis sometimes called _Himation_ [PALLIUM] as well as _Chiton_. They\r\nappeared in the company of men without any further covering; but the\r\nmarried women never did so without wearing an upper garment. This\r\nDoric chiton was made, as stated above, of woollen stuff; it was\r\nwithout sleeves, and was fastened over both shoulders by clasps or\r\nbuckles (πόρπαι, περόναι), which were often of considerable size.\r\nIt was frequently so short as not to reach the knee. It was only\r\njoined together on one side, and on the other was left partly open\r\nor slit up (σχιστός χίτων), to allow a free motion of the limbs. The\r\nfollowing cut represents an Amazon with a chiton of this kind: some\r\nparts of the figure appear incomplete, as the original is mutilated.\r\nThe Ionic chiton, on the contrary, was a long and loose garment,\r\nreaching to the feet (ποδήρης), with wide sleeves (κόραι), and was\r\nusually made of linen. The sleeves, however, appear generally to\r\nhave covered only the upper part of the arm; for in ancient works\r\nof art we seldom find the sleeve extending farther than the elbow,\r\nand sometimes not so far. The sleeves were sometimes slit up, and\r\nfastened together with an elegant row of brooches. The Ionic chiton,\r\naccording to Herodotus, was originally a Carian dress, and passed\r\nover to Athens from Ionia, as has been already remarked. The women\r\nat Athens originally wore the Doric chiton, but were compelled to\r\nchange it for the Ionic, after they had killed with the buckles or\r\nclasps of their dresses the single Athenian who had returned alive\r\nfrom the expedition against Aegina, because there were no buckles\r\nor clasps required in the Ionic dress. The preceding cut represents\r\nthe Muse Thalia wearing an Ionic chiton. The peplum has fallen off\r\nher shoulders, and is held up by the left hand. Both kinds of dress\r\nwere fastened round the middle with a girdle, and as the Ionic chiton\r\nwas usually longer than the body, part of it was drawn up so that\r\nthe dress might not reach farther than the feet, and the part which\r\nwas so drawn up overhung or overlapped the girdle, and was called\r\nκόλπος.--There was a peculiar kind of dress, which seems to have been\r\na species of double chiton, called _Diplois_ (διπλοΐς), _Diploidion_\r\n(διπλοΐδιον), and _Hemidiploidion_ (ἡμιδιπλοΐδιον).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diploidia, double Chitons. (Museo Borbonico, vol. ii.\r\ntav. 4, 6.)]\r\n\r\nIt appears not to have been a separate article of dress, but merely\r\nthe upper part of the cloth forming the chiton, which was larger than\r\nwas required for the ordinary chiton, and was therefore thrown over\r\nthe front and back. The following cuts will give a clearer idea of\r\nthe form of this garment than any description. Since the Diploidion\r\nwas fastened over the shoulders by means of buckles or clasps, it\r\nwas called _Epomis_ (ἐπωμίς), which is supposed by some writers to\r\nhave been only the end of the garment fastened on the shoulder. The\r\nchiton was worn by men next their skin; but females were accustomed\r\nto wear a chemise (χιτώνιον) under their chiton. It was the practice\r\namong most of the Greeks to wear an himation, or outer garment,\r\nover the chiton, but frequently the chiton was worn alone. A person\r\nwho wore only a chiton was called μονοχίτων (οἰοχίτων in Homer), an\r\nepithet given to the Spartan virgins. In the some way, a person who\r\nwore only an himation, or outer garment, was called ἀχίτων. The\r\nAthenian youths, in the earlier times, wore only the chiton, and when\r\nit became the fashion, in the Peloponnesian war, to wear an outer\r\ngarment over it, it was regarded as a mark of effeminacy.--(2) ROMAN.\r\nThe _Tunica_ of the Romans, like the Greek chiton, was a woollen\r\nunder-garment, over which the toga was worn. It was the _Indumentum_\r\nor _Indutus_, as opposed to the _Amictus_, the general term for the\r\ntoga, pallium, or any other outer garment. [AMICTUS.] The Romans\r\nare said to have had no other clothing originally but the toga; and\r\nwhen the tunic was first introduced, it was merely a short garment\r\nwithout sleeves, and was called _Colobium_. It was considered a mark\r\nof effeminacy for men to wear tunics with long sleeves (_manicatae_)\r\nand reaching to the feet (_talares_). The tunic was girded (_cincta_)\r\nwith a belt or girdle around the waist, but it was usually worn\r\nloose, without being girded, when a person was at home, or wished to\r\nbe at his ease. Hence we find the terms _cinctus_, _praecinctus_,\r\nand _succinctus_, applied, like the Greek εὔζωνος, to an active and\r\ndiligent person, and _discinctus_ to one who was idle or dissolute.\r\nThe form of the tunic, as worn by men, is represented in many\r\nwoodcuts in this work. In works of art it usually terminates a\r\nlittle above the knee; it has short sleeves, covering only the upper\r\npart of the arm, and is girded at the waist: the sleeves sometimes,\r\nthough less frequently, extend to the hands.--Both sexes at Rome\r\nusually wore two tunics, an outer and an under, the latter of which\r\nwas worn next the skin, and corresponds to our shirt and chemise.\r\nThe under tunics were called _Subucula_ and _Indusium_, the former\r\nof which is supposed to be the name of the under tunic of the men,\r\nand the latter of that of the women: but this is not certain. The\r\nword _Interula_ was of later origin, and seems to have been applied\r\nequally to the under tunic of both sexes. It is doubtful whether the\r\n_Supparus_ or _Supparum_ was an outer or an under garment. Persons\r\nsometimes wore several tunics, as a protection against cold: Augustus\r\nwore four in the winter, besides a subucula. As the dress of a man\r\nusually consisted of an under tunic, an outer tunic, and the toga,\r\nso that of a woman, in like manner, consisted of an under tunic, an\r\nouter tunic, and the palla. The outer tunic of the Roman matron was\r\nproperly called stola [STOLA], and is represented in the woodcut on\r\np. 355; but the annexed woodcut, which represents a Roman empress\r\nin the character of Concordia, or Abundantia, gives a better idea\r\nof its form. Over the tunic or stola the palla is thrown in many\r\nfolds, but the shape of the former is still distinctly shown. The\r\ntunics of women were larger and longer than those of men, and always\r\nhad sleeves; but in ancient paintings and statues we seldom find\r\nthe sleeves covering more than the upper part of the arm. Sometimes\r\nthe tunics were adorned with golden ornaments called _Leria_. Poor\r\npeople, who could not afford to purchase a toga, wore the tunic\r\nalone, whence we find the common people called _Tunicati_. A person\r\nwho wore only his tunic was frequently called NUDUS. Respecting the\r\nclavus latus and the clavus angustus, worn on the tunics of the\r\nsenators and equites respectively, see CLAVUS LATUS, CLAVUS ANGUSTUS.\r\nWhen a triumph was celebrated, the conqueror wore, together with an\r\nembroidered toga (_Toga picta_), a flowered tunic (_Tunica palmata_),\r\nalso called _Tunica Jovis_, because it was taken from the temple of\r\nJupiter Capitolinus. Tunics of this kind were sent as presents to\r\nforeign kings by the senate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roman Tunic. (Visconti, Monumenti Gabini, n. 34.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTŪRĬBŬLUM (θυμιατήριον), a censer. The Greeks and Romans, when they\r\nsacrificed, commonly took a little frankincense out of the ACERRA\r\nand let it fall upon the flaming altar. [ARA.] More rarely they\r\nused a censer, by means of which they burnt the incense in greater\r\nprofusion, and which was in fact a small moveable grate or FOCULUS.\r\nThe annexed cut shows the performance of both of these acts at the\r\nsame time. Winckelmann supposes it to represent Livia, the wife, and\r\nOctavia, the sister of Augustus, sacrificing to Mars in gratitude\r\nfor his safe return from Spain. The censer here represented has two\r\nhandles for the purpose of carrying it from place to place, and it\r\nstands upon feet so that the air might be admitted underneath, and\r\npass upwards through the fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Livia and Octavia Sacrificing. (From an ancient\r\nPainting.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTURMA. [EXERCITUS, p. 166, b.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTURRIS (πύργος), a tower. Moveable towers were among the most\r\nimportant engines used in storming a fortified place. They were\r\ngenerally made of beams and planks, and covered, at least on the\r\nthree sides which were exposed to the besieged, with iron, not only\r\nfor protection, but also to increase their weight, and thus make\r\nthem steadier. They were also covered with raw hides and quilts,\r\nmoistened, and sometimes with alum, to protect them from fire.\r\nTheir height was such as to overtop the walls, towers, and all\r\nother fortifications of the besieged place. They were divided into\r\nstories (_tabulata_ or _tecta_), and hence they are called _turres\r\ncontabulatae_. The sides of the towers were pierced with windows, of\r\nwhich there were several to each story. The use of the stories was\r\nto receive the engines of war (_tormenta_). They contained balistae\r\nand catapults, and slingers and archers were stationed in them, and\r\non the tops of the towers. In the lowest story was a battering-ram\r\n[ARIES]; and in the middle one or more bridges (_pontes_) made\r\nof beams and planks, and protected at the sides by hurdles.\r\nScaling-ladders (_scalae_) were also carried in the towers, and when\r\nthe missiles had cleared the walls, these bridges and ladders enabled\r\nthe besiegers to rush upon them. These towers were placed upon wheels\r\n(generally 6 or 8), that they might be brought up to the walls. These\r\nwheels were placed for security inside of the tower.\r\n\r\n\r\nTŪTOR. [CURATOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTYMPĂNUM (τύμπανον), a small drum carried in the hand. Of these, some\r\nresembled in all respects a modern tambourine with bells. Others\r\npresented a flat circular disk on the upper surface and swelled out\r\nbeneath like a kettle-drum. Both forms are represented in the cuts\r\nbelow. Tympana were covered with the hides of oxen, or of asses; were\r\nbeaten with a stick, or with the hand, and were much employed in all\r\nwild enthusiastic religious rites, especially the orgies of Bacchus\r\nand Cybele.--(2) A solid wheel without spokes, for heavy waggons,\r\nsuch as is shown in the cut on p. 298.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tympana. (From ancient Paintings.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTỸRANNUS (τύραννος). In the heroic age all the governments in\r\nGreece were monarchical, the king uniting in himself the functions\r\nof the priest, the judge, and military chief. In the first two or\r\nthree centuries following the Trojan war various causes were at\r\nwork, which led to the abolition, or at least to the limitation, of\r\nthe kingly power. Emigrations, extinctions of families, disasters\r\nin war, civil dissensions, may be reckoned among these causes.\r\nHereditary monarchies became elective; the different functions\r\nof the king were distributed; he was called _Archon_ (ἄρχων),\r\n_Cosmus_ (κόσμος), or _Prytanis_ (πρύτανις), instead of _Basileus_\r\n(βασιλεύς), and his character was changed no less than his name.\r\nNoble and wealthy families began to be considered on a footing\r\nof equality with royalty; and thus in process of time sprang up\r\noligarchies or aristocracies, which most of the governments that\r\nsucceeded the ancient monarchies were in point of fact, though not\r\nas yet called by such names. These oligarchies did not possess the\r\nelements of social happiness or stability. The principal families\r\ncontended with each other for the greatest share of power, and were\r\nonly unanimous in disregarding the rights of those whose station was\r\nbeneath their own. The people, oppressed by the privileged classes,\r\nbegan to regret the loss of their old paternal form of government;\r\nand were ready to assist any one who would attempt to restore it.\r\nThus were opportunities offered to ambitious and designing men to\r\nraise themselves, by starting up as the champions of popular right.\r\nDiscontented nobles were soon found to prosecute schemes of this\r\nsort, and they had a greater chance of success, if descended from\r\nthe ancient royal family. Pisistratus is an example; he was the\r\nmore acceptable to the people of Athens, as being a descendant of\r\nthe family of Codrus. Thus in many cities arose that species of\r\nmonarchy which the Greeks called _tyrannis_ (τυραννίς), which meant\r\nonly _a despotism_, or irresponsible dominion of one man; and which\r\nfrequently was nothing more than a revival of the ancient government,\r\nand, though unaccompanied with any recognised hereditary title, or\r\nthe reverence attached to old name and long prescription, was hailed\r\nby the lower orders of people as a good exchange, after suffering\r\nunder the domination of the oligarchy. All _tyrannies_, however,\r\nwere not so acceptable to the majority; and sometimes we find the\r\nnobles concurring in the elevation of a despot, to further their\r\nown interests. Thus the Syracusan _Gamori_, who had been expelled\r\nby the populace, on receiving the protection of Gelon, sovereign\r\nof Gela and Camarina, enabled him to take possession of Syracuse,\r\nand establish his kingdom there. Sometimes the conflicting parties\r\nin the state, by mutual consent, chose some eminent man, in whom\r\nthey had confidence, to reconcile their dissensions; investing him\r\nwith a sort of dictatorial power for that purpose, either for a\r\nlimited period or otherwise. Such a person they called _Aesymnetes_\r\n(αἰσυμνήτης). The _tyrannus_ must be distinguished, on the one hand,\r\nfrom the _aesymnetes_, inasmuch as he was not elected by general\r\nconsent, but commonly owed his elevation to some violent movement\r\nor stratagem, such as the creation of a body-guard for him by the\r\npeople, or the seizure of the citadel; and on the other hand, from\r\nthe ancient king, whose right depended, not on usurpation, but on\r\ninheritance and traditionary acknowledgment. The power of a king\r\nmight be more absolute than that of a _tyrant_; as Phidon of Argos\r\nis said to have made the royal prerogative greater than it was\r\nunder his predecessors; yet he was still regarded as a king; for\r\nthe difference between the two names depended on title and origin,\r\nand not on the manner in which the power was exercised. The name of\r\n_tyrant_ was originally so far from denoting a person who abused\r\nhis power, or treated his subjects with cruelty, that Pisistratus\r\nis praised for the moderation of his government. Afterwards, when\r\n_tyrants_ themselves had become odious, the name also grew to be\r\na word of reproach, just as _rex_ did among the Romans. Among\r\nthe early _tyrants_ of Greece those most worthy of mention are:\r\nClisthenes of Sicyon, grandfather of the Athenian Clisthenes, in\r\nwhose family the government continued for a century since its\r\nestablishment by Orthagoras, about B.C. 672; Cypselus of Corinth,\r\nwho expelled the Bacchiadae, B.C. 656, and his son Periander, both\r\nremarkable for their cruelty; their dynasty lasted between seventy\r\nand eighty years; Procles of Epidaurus; Pantaleon of Pisa, who\r\ncelebrated the thirty-fourth Olympiad, depriving the Eleans of the\r\npresidency; Theagenes of Megara, father-in-law to Cylon the Athenian;\r\nPisistratus, whose sons were the last of the early _tyrants_ on the\r\nGrecian continent. In Sicily, where _tyranny_ most flourished, the\r\nprincipal were Phalaris of Agrigentum, who established his power in\r\nB.C. 568; Theron of Agrigentum; Gelon, already mentioned, who, in\r\nconjunction with Theron, defeated Hamilcar the Carthaginian, on the\r\nsame day on which the battle of Salamis was fought; and Hieron, his\r\nbrother: the last three celebrated by Pindar. The following also are\r\nworthy of notice: Polycrates of Samos; Lygdamis of Naxos; Histiaeus\r\nand Aristagoras of Miletus. Perhaps the last mentioned can hardly be\r\nclassed among the _Greek tyrants_, as they were connected with the\r\nPersian monarchy. The general characteristics of a _tyranny_ were,\r\nthat it was bound by no laws, and had no recognised limitation to its\r\nauthority, however it might be restrained _in practice_ by the good\r\ndisposition of the _tyrant_ himself, or by fear, or by the spirit of\r\nthe age. It was commonly most odious to the wealthy and noble, whom\r\nthe _tyrant_ looked upon with jealousy as a check upon his power,\r\nand whom he often sought to get rid of by sending them into exile\r\nor putting them to death. The _tyrant_ usually kept a body-guard\r\nof foreign mercenaries, by aid of whom he controlled the people at\r\nhome; but he seldom ventured to make war, for fear of giving an\r\nopportunity to his subjects to revolt. The causes which led to the\r\ndecline of _tyranny_ among the Greeks were partly the degeneracy of\r\nthe _tyrants_ themselves, corrupted by power, indolence, flattery,\r\nand bad education; for even where the father set a good example, it\r\nwas seldom followed by the son; partly the cruelties and excesses of\r\nparticular men, which brought them all into disrepute; and partly\r\nthe growing spirit of inquiry among the Greek people, who began to\r\nspeculate upon political theories, and soon became discontented\r\nwith a form of government, which had nothing in theory, and little\r\nin practice, to recommend it. Few dynasties lasted beyond the third\r\ngeneration. Most of the tyrannies, which flourished before the\r\nPersian war, are said to have been overthrown by the exertions of\r\nSparta, jealous, probably, of any innovation upon the old Doric\r\nconstitution, especially of any tendency to ameliorate the condition\r\nof the Periocci, and anxious to extend her own influence over the\r\nstates of Greece by means of the benefits which she conferred. Upon\r\nthe fall of _tyranny_, the various republican forms of government\r\nwere established, the Dorian states generally favouring oligarchy,\r\nthe Ionian democracy. Of the tyrants of a later period, the most\r\ncelebrated are the two Dionysii. The corruption of the Syracusans,\r\ntheir intestine discords, and the fear of the Carthaginian invaders,\r\nled to the appointment of Dionysius to the chief military command,\r\nwith unlimited powers; by means of which he raised himself to the\r\nthrone, B.C. 406, and reigned for 38 years, leaving his son to\r\nsucceed him. The younger Dionysius, far inferior in every respect to\r\nhis father, was expelled by Dion, afterwards regained the throne, and\r\nwas again expelled by Timoleon, who restored liberty to the various\r\nstates of Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUDO, a sock of goat’s-hair or felt, worn by countrymen with the low\r\nboots called _perones_. [PERO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nULNA. [PES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUMBĬLĪCUS. [LIBER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUMBO. [CLIPEUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUMBRĀCŬLUM, UMBELLA (σκιάδειον, σκιάδιον, σκιαδίσκη), a parasol, was\r\nused by Greek and Roman ladies as a protection against the sun. They\r\nseem not to have been carried generally by the ladies themselves,\r\nbut by female slaves, who held them over their mistresses. The\r\ndaughters of the aliens (μέτοικοι) at Athens had to carry parasols\r\nafter the Athenian maidens at the Panathenaea, as is mentioned under\r\nHYDRIAPHORIA. The parasols of the ancients seem to have been exactly\r\nlike our own parasols or umbrellas in form, and could be shut up and\r\nopened like ours. It was considered a mark of effeminacy for men to\r\nmake use of parasols. The Roman ladies used them in the amphitheatre\r\nto defend themselves from the sun or some passing shower, when\r\nthe wind or other circumstances did not allow the velarium to be\r\nextended. [AMPHITHEATRUM.] To hold a parasol over a lady was one\r\nof the common attentions of lovers, and it seems to have been very\r\ncommon to give parasols as presents. Instead of parasols, the Greek\r\nwomen in later times wore a kind of straw hat or bonnet, called\r\n_tholia_ (θολία). The Romans also wore a hat with a broad brim\r\n(_petasus_) as a protection against the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Umbraculum, Parasol. (From an ancient Vase.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCIA (ὀγκία, οὐγκία, οὐγγία), the twelfth part of the AS or LIBRA,\r\nis derived by Varro from _unus_, as being the unit of the divisions\r\nof the as. Its value as a weight was 433·666 grains, or ¾ of an\r\nounce and 105·36 grains avoirdupois. [LIBRA.] In connecting the\r\nRoman system of weights and money with the Greek another division of\r\nthe uncia was used. When the drachma was introduced into the Roman\r\nsystem as equivalent to the denarius of 96 to the pound [DENARIUS;\r\nDRACHMA], the uncia contained 8 drachmae, the drachma 3 scrupula, the\r\nscrupulum 2 oboli (since 6 oboli made up the drachma), and the obolos\r\n3 siliquae (κερατία). In this division we have the origin of the\r\nmodern Italian system, in which the pound is divided into 12 ounces,\r\nthe ounce into 3 drams, the dram into 3 scruples, and the scruple\r\ninto 6 carats. In each of these systems 1728 κερατία, siliquae, or\r\ncarats, make up the pound. The Romans applied the uncial division to\r\nall kinds of magnitude. [AS.] In length the uncia was the twelfth\r\nof a foot, whence the word _inch_ [PES], in area the twelfth of a\r\njugerum [JUGERUM], in content the twelfth of a sextarius [SEXTARIUS;\r\nCYATHUS], in time the twelfth of an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCIĀRĬUM FĒNUS. [FENUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCTŌRES. [BALNEUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUNGUENTA, ointments, oils, or salves. The application of unguenta in\r\nconnection with the bathing and athletic contests of the ancients is\r\nstated under BALNEUM and ATHLETAE. But although their original object\r\nwas simply to preserve the health and elasticity of the human frame,\r\nthey were in later times used as articles of luxury. They were then\r\nnot only employed to impart to the body or hair a particular colour,\r\nbut also to give to them the most beautiful fragrance possible; they\r\nwere, moreover, not merely applied after a bath, but at any time,\r\nto render one’s appearance or presence more pleasant than usual. In\r\nshort, they were used then as oils and pomatums are at present. At\r\nRome these luxuries did not become very general till towards the end\r\nof the republic, while the Greeks appear to have been familiar with\r\nthem from early times. The wealthy Greeks and Romans carried their\r\nointments and perfumes with them, especially when they bathed, in\r\nsmall boxes of costly materials and beautiful workmanship, which\r\nwere called _Narthecia_. The traffic which was carried on in these\r\nointments and perfumes in several towns of Greece and southern Italy\r\nwas very considerable. The persons engaged in manufacturing them\r\nwere called by the Romans _Unguentarii_, or, as they frequently\r\nwere women, _Unguentariae_, and the art of manufacturing them\r\n_Unguentaria_. In the wealthy and effeminate city of Capua there was\r\none great street, called the Seplasia, which consisted entirely of\r\nshops in which ointments and perfumes were sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nŪRĀGUS. [CENTURIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nURCĔUS, a pitcher or water-pot, generally made of earthenware, was\r\nused by the priests at Rome in the sacrifices, and thus appears with\r\nother sacrificial emblems on Roman coins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Urceus and Lituus on obverse of Coin of Pompey.]\r\n\r\n\r\nURNA, an urn, a Roman measure of capacity for fluids, equal to half\r\nan AMPHORA. This use of the term was probably founded upon its more\r\ngeneral application to denote a vessel for holding water, or any\r\nother substance, either fluid or solid. An urn was used to receive\r\nthe names of the judges (_judices_) in order that the praetor might\r\ndraw out of it a sufficient number to determine causes: also to\r\nreceive the ashes of the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSTRĪNA, USTRĪNUM. [BUSTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nŪSŪCĂPĬO, the possession of property for a certain time without\r\ninterruption. The Twelve Tables declared that the ownership of land,\r\na house, or other immoveable property, could be acquired by usucapio\r\nin two years; and of moveable property by usucapio in one year.\r\n\r\n\r\nŪSŪRAE. [FENUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nŪSUS. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nŪSUSFRUCTUS was the right to the enjoyment of a thing by one person,\r\nwhile the ownership belonged to another. He who had the ususfructus\r\nwas _Ususfructuarius_ or _Fructuarius_, and the object of the\r\nususfructus was _Res Fructuaria_.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTRĬCŬLĀRĬUS. [TIBIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUXOR. [MATRIMONIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUXŌRĬUM. [AES UXORIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVĂCATĬO. [EXERCITUS, EMERITI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĂDĬMŌNĬUM, VAS. [ACTIO; PRAES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĀGĪNA. [GLADIUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVALLUM, a term applied either to the whole or a portion of the\r\nfortifications of a Roman camp. It is derived from _vallus_ (a\r\nstake), and properly means the palisade which ran along the outer\r\nedge of the agger, but it very frequently includes the agger also.\r\nThe _vallum_, in the latter sense, together with the _fossa_ or ditch\r\nwhich surrounded the camp outside of the _vallum_, formed a complete\r\nfortification. The _valli_ (χάρακες), of which the _vallum_, in\r\nthe former and more limited sense, was composed, are described by\r\nPolybius and Livy, who make a comparison between the _vallum_ of the\r\nGreeks and that of the Romans, very much to the advantage of the\r\nlatter. Both used for _valli_ young trees or arms of larger trees,\r\nwith the side branches on them; but the _valli_ of the Greeks were\r\nmuch larger and had more branches than those of the Romans, which\r\nhad either two or three, or at the most four branches, and these\r\ngenerally on the same side. The Greeks placed their valli in the\r\nagger at considerable intervals, the spaces between them being filled\r\nup by the branches; the Romans fixed theirs close together, and made\r\nthe branches interlace, and sharpened their points carefully. Hence\r\nthe Greek vallus could easily be taken hold of by its large branches\r\nand pulled from its place, and when it was removed a large opening\r\nwas left in the vallum. The Roman vallus, on the contrary, presented\r\nno convenient handle, required very great force to pull it down,\r\nand even if removed left a very small opening. The Greek valli were\r\ncut on the spot; the Romans prepared theirs beforehand, and each\r\nsoldier carried three or four of them when on a march. They were\r\nmade of any strong wood, but oak was preferred. The word _vallus_\r\nis sometimes used as equivalent to _vallum_. In the operations of\r\na siege, when the place could not be taken by storm, and it became\r\nnecessary to establish a blockade, this was done by drawing defences\r\nsimilar to those of a camp round the town, which was then said to be\r\n_circumvallatum_. Such a circumvallation, besides cutting off all\r\ncommunication between the town and the surrounding country, formed\r\na defence against the sallies of the besieged. There was often a\r\ndouble line of fortifications, the inner against the town, and the\r\nouter against a force that might attempt to raise the siege. In this\r\ncase the army was encamped between the two lines of works. This\r\nkind of circumvallation, which the Greeks called ἀποτειχισμός and\r\nπεριτειχισμός, was employed by the Peloponnesians in the siege of\r\nPlataeae. Their lines consisted of two walls (apparently of turf)\r\nat the distance of 16 feet, which surrounded the city in the form\r\nof a circle. Between the walls were the huts of the besiegers. The\r\nwall had battlements (ἐπάλξεις), and at every tenth battlement\r\nwas a tower, filling up by its depth the whole space between the\r\nwalls. There was a passage for the besiegers through the middle\r\nof each tower. On the outside of each wall was a ditch (τάφρος).\r\nThis description would almost exactly answer to the Roman mode of\r\ncircumvallation, of which some of the best examples are that of\r\nCarthage by Scipio, that of Numantia by Scipio, and that of Alesia\r\nby Caesar. The towers in such lines were similar to those used in\r\nattacking fortified places, but not so high, and of course not\r\nmoveable. [TURRIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVALVAE. [JANUA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVANNUS (λικμός, λίκνον), a winnowing-van, _i.e._ a broad basket,\r\ninto which the corn mixed with chaff was received after thrashing,\r\nand was then thrown in the direction of the wind. Virgil dignifies\r\nthis simple implement by calling it _mystica vannus Iacchi_. The\r\nrites of Bacchus, as well as those of Ceres, having a continual\r\nreference to the occupations of rural life, the vannus was borne in\r\nthe processions celebrated in honour of both these divinities. In the\r\ncut annexed the infant Bacchus is carried in a vannus by two dancing\r\nbacchantes clothed in skins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bacchus carried in a Vannus. (From an Antefixa in the\r\nBritish Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nVAS (pl. _vasa_), a general term for any kind of vessel. Thus\r\nwe read of _vas vinarium_, _vas argenteum_, _vasa Corinthia et\r\nDeliaca_, _vasa Samia_, that is, made of Samian earthenware, _vasa\r\nMurrhina_. [MURRHINA VASA.] The word _vas_ was used in a still wider\r\nsignification, and was applied to any kind of utensil used in the\r\nkitchen, agriculture, &c. The utensils of the soldiers were called\r\n_vasa_, and hence _vasa colligere_ and _vasa conclamare_ signify to\r\npack up the baggage, to give the signal for departure.\r\n\r\n\r\nVECTĪGĀLĬA, the general term for all the regular revenues of the\r\nRoman state. It means anything which is brought (_vehitur_) into the\r\npublic treasury, like the Greek φόρος. The earliest regular income\r\nof the state was in all probability the rent paid for the use of\r\nthe public land and pastures. This revenue was called _pascua_, a\r\nname which was used as late as the time of Pliny, in the tables\r\nor registers of the censors for all the revenues of the state in\r\ngeneral. The senate was the supreme authority in all matters of\r\nfinance, but as the state did not occupy itself with collecting\r\nthe taxes, duties, and tributes, the censors were entrusted with\r\nthe actual business. These officers, who in this respect may not\r\nunjustly be compared to modern ministers of finance, used to let the\r\nvarious branches of the revenue to the publicani for a fixed sum, and\r\nfor a certain number of years. [CENSOR; PUBLICANI.] As most of the\r\nbranches of the public revenues of Rome are treated of in separate\r\narticles, it is only necessary to give a list of them here, and to\r\nexplain those which have not been treated of separately. 1. The\r\ntithes paid to the state by those who occupied the ager publicus.\r\n[DECUMAE; AGER PUBLICUS.] 2. The sums paid by those who kept their\r\ncattle on the public pastures. [SCRIPTURA.] 3. The harbour duties\r\nraised upon imported and exported commodities. [PORTORIUM.] 4. The\r\nrevenue derived from the salt-works. [SALINAE.] 5. The revenues\r\nderived from the mines (_metalla_). This branch of the public revenue\r\ncannot have been very productive until the Romans had become masters\r\nof foreign countries. Until that time the mines of Italy appear to\r\nhave been worked, but this was forbidden by the senate after the\r\nconquest of foreign lands. The mines of conquered countries were\r\ntreated like the salinae. 6. The hundredth part of the value of all\r\nthings which were sold (_centesima rerum venalium_). This tax was not\r\ninstituted at Rome until the time of the civil wars; the persons who\r\ncollected it were called _coactores_. Tiberius reduced this tax to a\r\ntwo-hundredth (_ducentesima_), and Caligula abolished it for Italy\r\naltogether, whence upon several coins of this emperor we read R. C.\r\nC., that is, _Remissa Ducentesima_. Respecting the tax raised upon\r\nthe sale of slaves, see QUINQUAGESIMA. 7. The vicesima hereditatum\r\net manumissionum. [VICESIMA.] 8. The tribute imposed upon foreign\r\ncountries was by far the most important branch of the public revenue\r\nduring the time of Rome’s greatness. It was sometimes raised at\r\nonce, sometimes paid by instalments, and sometimes changed into a\r\npoll-tax, which was in many cases regulated according to the census.\r\nIn regard to Cilicia and Syria we know that this tax amounted to one\r\nper cent. of a person’s census, to which a tax upon houses and slaves\r\nwas added. In some cases the tribute was not paid according to the\r\ncensus, but consisted in a land-tax. 9. A tax upon bachelors. [AES\r\nUXORIUM.] 10. A door-tax. [OSTIARIUM.] 11. The _octavae_. In the\r\ntime of Caesar all liberti living in Italy, and possessing property\r\nof 200 sestertia, and above it, had to pay a tax consisting of the\r\neighth part of their property.--It would be interesting to ascertain\r\nthe amount of income which Rome at various periods derived from these\r\nand other sources; but our want of information renders it impossible.\r\nWe have only the general statement, that previously to the time of\r\nPompey the annual revenue amounted to fifty millions of drachmas, and\r\nthat it was increased by him to eighty-five millions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVĒLĀRĬUM. [AMPHITHEATRUM, p. 23.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĒLĬTES, the light-armed troops in a Roman army. [EXERCITUS, p. 169.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĒLUM (αὐλαία).--(1) A curtain. Curtains were used in private\r\nhouses as coverings over doors, or they served in the interior of\r\nthe house as substitutes for doors.--(2) _Velum_, and more commonly\r\nits derivative _velamen_, denoted the veil worn by women. That worn\r\nby a bride was specifically called _flammeum_. [MATRIMONIUM.]--(3)\r\n(Ἱστίον.) A sail. [NAVIS, p. 267.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĒNĀBŬLUM, a hunting-spear. This may have been distinguished from\r\nthe spears used in warfare by being barbed; at least it is often so\r\nformed in ancient works of art. It was seldom, if ever, thrown, but\r\nheld so as to slant downwards and to receive the attacks of the wild\r\nboars and other beasts of chace.\r\n\r\n\r\nVĒNĀTĬO, hunting, was the name given among the Romans to an\r\nexhibition of wild beasts, which fought with one another and with\r\nmen. These exhibitions originally formed part of the games of the\r\ncircus. Julius Caesar first built a wooden amphitheatre for the\r\nexhibition of wild beasts, and others were subsequently erected;\r\nbut we frequently read of venationes in the circus in subsequent\r\ntimes. The persons who fought with the beasts were either condemned\r\ncriminals or captives, or individuals who did so for the sake of\r\npay, and were trained for the purpose. [BESTIARII.] The Romans were\r\nas passionately fond of this entertainment as of the exhibitions of\r\ngladiators, and during the latter days of the republic, and under\r\nthe empire, an immense variety of animals was collected from all\r\nparts of the Roman world for the gratification of the people, and\r\nmany thousands were frequently slain at one time. We do not know on\r\nwhat occasion a venatio was first exhibited at Rome; but the first\r\nmention we find of any thing of the kind is in the year B.C. 251,\r\nwhen L. Metellus exhibited in the circus 142 elephants, which he had\r\nbrought from Sicily after his victory over the Carthaginians. But\r\nthis can scarcely be regarded as an instance of a venatio, as it\r\nwas understood in later times, since the elephants are said to have\r\nbeen only killed because the Romans did not know what to do with\r\nthem, and not for the amusement of the people. There was, however,\r\na venatio in the later sense of the word in B.C. 186, in the games\r\ncelebrated by M. Fulvius in fulfilment of the vow which he had\r\nmade in the Aetolian war; in these games lions and panthers were\r\nexhibited. It is mentioned as a proof of the growing magnificence of\r\nthe age that in the ludi circenses, exhibited by the curule aediles\r\nP. Cornelius Scipio Nasica and P. Lentulus B.C. 168, there were 63\r\nAfrican panthers and 40 bears and elephants. From about this time\r\ncombats with wild beasts probably formed a regular part of the ludi\r\ncircenses, and many of the curule aediles made great efforts to\r\nobtain rare and curious animals, and put in requisition the services\r\nof their friends. Elephants are said to have first fought in the\r\ncircus in the curule aedileship of Claudius Pulcher, B.C. 99; and\r\ntwenty years afterwards, in the curule aedileship of the two Luculli,\r\nthey fought against bulls. A hundred lions were exhibited by Sulla\r\nin his praetorship, which were destroyed by javelin-men sent by king\r\nBocchus for the purpose. This was the first time that lions were\r\nallowed to be loose in the circus; they were previously always tied\r\nup. The games, however, in the curule aedileship of Scaurus, B.C. 58,\r\nsurpassed anything the Romans had ever seen; among other novelties,\r\nhe first exhibited an hippopotamos and five crocodiles in a temporary\r\ncanal or trench (_euripus_). At the venatio given by Pompey in his\r\nsecond consulship, B.C. 55, upon the dedication of the temple of\r\nVenus Victrix, there was an immense number of animals slaughtered,\r\namong which we find mention of 600 lions, and 18 or 20 elephants;\r\nthe latter fought with Gaetulians, who hurled darts against them,\r\nand they attempted to break through the railings (_clathri_) by\r\nwhich they were separated from the spectators. To guard against this\r\ndanger Julius Caesar surrounded the arena of the amphitheatre with\r\ntrenches (_euripi_). In the games exhibited by J. Caesar in his\r\nthird consulship, B.C. 45, the venatio lasted for five days, and was\r\nconducted with extraordinary splendour. Cameleopards or giraffes were\r\nthen for the first time seen in Italy. The venationes seem to have\r\nbeen first confined to the ludi circenses, but during the later times\r\nof the republic, and under the empire, they were frequently exhibited\r\non the celebration of triumphs, and on many other occasions, with the\r\nview of pleasing the people. The passion for these shows continued\r\nto increase under the empire, and the number of beasts sometimes\r\nslaughtered seems almost incredible. Under the emperors we read of\r\na particular kind of venatio, in which the beasts were not killed\r\nby bestiarii, but were given up to the people, who were allowed to\r\nrush into the area of the circus and carry away what they pleased.\r\nOn such occasions a number of large trees, which had been torn up by\r\nthe roots, was planted in the circus, which thus resembled a forest,\r\nand none of the more savage animals were admitted into it. One of the\r\nmost extraordinary venationes of this kind was that given by Probus,\r\nin which there were 1000 ostriches, 1000 stags, 1000 boars, 1000\r\ndeer, and numbers of wild goats, wild sheep, and other animals of the\r\nsame kind. The more savage animals were slain by the bestiarii in\r\nthe amphitheatre, and not in the circus. Thus, in the day succeeding\r\nthe venatio of Probus just mentioned, there were slain in the\r\namphitheatre 100 lions and 100 lionesses, 100 Libyan and 100 Syrian\r\nleopards, and 300 bears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Venationes. (From Bas-reliefs on the Tomb of Scaurus\r\nat Pompeii.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĔNĒFĬCĬUM, the crime of poisoning, is frequently mentioned in Roman\r\nhistory. Women were most addicted to it: but it seems not improbable\r\nthat this charge was frequently brought against females without\r\nsufficient evidence of their guilt, like that of witchcraft in Europe\r\nin the middle ages. We find females condemned to death for this crime\r\nin seasons of pestilence, when the people are always in an excited\r\nstate of mind, and ready to attribute the calamities under which they\r\nsuffer to the arts of evil-disposed persons. Thus the Athenians,\r\nwhen the pestilence raged in their city during the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, supposed the wells to have been poisoned by the Peloponnesians,\r\nand similar instances occur in the history of almost all states.\r\nStill, however, the crime of poisoning seems to have been much more\r\nfrequent in ancient than in modern times; and this circumstance\r\nwould lead persons to suspect it in cases when there was no real\r\nground for the suspicion. At Athens the PHARMACON GRAPHE was brought\r\nagainst poisoners. At Rome the first legislative enactment especially\r\ndirected against poisoning was a law of the dictator Sulla--Lex\r\nCornelia de Sicariis et Veneficis--passed in B.C. 82, which continued\r\nin force, with some alterations, to the latest times. It contained\r\nprovisions against all who made, bought, sold, possessed, or gave\r\npoison for the purpose of poisoning. The punishment fixed by this law\r\nwas the interdictio aquae et ignis.\r\n\r\n\r\nVER SACRUM (ἔτος ἱερόν). It was a custom among the early Italian\r\nnations, especially among the Sabines, in times of great danger and\r\ndistress, to vow to the deity the sacrifice of everything born in the\r\nnext spring, that is, between the first of March and the last day\r\nof April, if the calamity under which they were labouring should be\r\nremoved. This sacrifice in the early times comprehended both men and\r\ndomestic animals, and there is little doubt that in many cases the\r\nvow was really carried into effect. But in later times it was thought\r\ncruel to sacrifice so many infants, and accordingly the following\r\nexpedient was adopted. The children were allowed to grow up, and in\r\nthe spring of their twentieth or twenty-first year they were with\r\ncovered faces driven across the frontier of their native country,\r\nwhereupon they went whithersoever fortune or the deity might lead\r\nthem. Many a colony had been founded by persons driven out in this\r\nmanner; and the Mamertines in Sicily were the descendants of such\r\ndevoted persons. In the two historical instances in which the Romans\r\nvowed a ver sacrum, that is, after the battle of lake Trasimenus\r\nand at the close of the second Punic war, the vow was confined to\r\ndomestic animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERBĒNA.

[FUNUS, p. 188.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVESTĀLES, the virgin priestesses of Vesta, who ministered in her\r\ntemple and watched the eternal fire. Their existence at Alba Longa is\r\nconnected with the earliest Roman traditions, for Silvia the mother\r\nof Romulus was a member of the sisterhood; their establishment in\r\nthe city, in common with almost all other matters connected with\r\nstate religion, is generally ascribed to Numa, who selected four,\r\ntwo from the Titienses and two from the Ramnes; and two more were\r\nsubsequently added from the Luceres, by Tarquinius Priscus according\r\nto one authority, by Servius Tullius according to another. This\r\nnumber of six remained unchanged to the latest times. They were\r\noriginally chosen (_capere_ is the technical word) by the king,\r\nand during the republic and empire by the pontifex maximus. It was\r\nnecessary that the maiden should not be under six nor above ten\r\nyears of age, perfect in all her limbs, in the full enjoyment of\r\nall her senses, patrima et matrima [PATRIMI], the daughter of free\r\nand freeborn parents who had never been in slavery, who followed\r\nno dishonourable occupation, and whose home was in Italy. The Lex\r\nPapia ordained that when a vacancy occurred the pontifex maximus\r\nshould name at his discretion twenty qualified damsels, one of whom\r\nwas publicly (_in concione_) fixed upon by lot, an exemption being\r\ngranted in favour of such as had a sister already a vestal, and of\r\nthe daughters of certain priests of a high class. The above law\r\nappears to have been enacted in consequence of the unwillingness of\r\nfathers to resign all control over a child, and this reluctance was\r\nmanifested so strongly in later times, that in the age of Augustus\r\n_libertinae_ were declared eligible. The casting of lots moreover\r\ndoes not seem to have been practised if any respectable person\r\ncame forward voluntarily, and offered a daughter who fulfilled the\r\nnecessary conditions. As soon as the election was concluded, the\r\npontifex maximus took the girl by the hand and addressed her in a\r\nsolemn form. After this was pronounced she was led away to the atrium\r\nof Vesta, and lived thenceforward within the sacred precincts, under\r\nthe special superintendence and control of the pontifical college.\r\nThe period of service lasted for thirty years. During the first ten\r\nthe priestess was engaged in learning her mysterious duties, being\r\ntermed _discipula_, during the next ten in performing them, during\r\nthe last ten in giving instructions to the novices, and so long as\r\nshe was thus employed she was bound by a solemn vow of chastity. But\r\nafter the time specified was completed, she might, if she thought\r\nfit, throw off the emblems of her office, unconsecrate herself\r\n(_exaugurare_), return to the world, and even enter into the marriage\r\nstate. Few however availed themselves of these privileges; those who\r\ndid were said to have lived in sorrow and remorse (as might indeed\r\nhave been expected from the habits they had formed); hence such a\r\nproceeding was considered ominous, and the priestesses for the most\r\npart died, as they had lived, in the service of the goddess. The\r\nsenior sister was entitled _Vestalis Maxima_, or _Virgo Maxima_,\r\nand we find also the expressions _Vestalium vetustissima_ and _tres\r\nmaximae_. Their chief office was to watch by turns, night and day,\r\nthe everlasting fire which blazed upon the altar of Vesta, its\r\nextinction being considered as the most fearful of all prodigies, and\r\nemblematic of the extinction of the state. If such misfortune befell,\r\nand was caused by the carelessness of the priestess on duty, she\r\nwas stripped and scourged by the pontifex maximus, in the dark and\r\nwith a screen interposed, and he rekindled the flame by the friction\r\nof two pieces of wood from a _felix arbor_. Their other ordinary\r\nduties consisted in presenting offerings to the goddess at stated\r\ntimes, and in sprinkling and purifying the shrine each morning with\r\nwater, which according to the institution of Numa was to be drawn\r\nfrom the Egerian fount, although in later times it was considered\r\nlawful to employ any water from a living spring or running stream,\r\nbut not such as had passed through pipes. When used for sacrificial\r\npurposes it was mixed with _muries_, that is, salt which had been\r\npounded in a mortar, thrown into an earthen jar, and baked in an\r\noven. They assisted moreover at all great public holy rites, such as\r\nthe festivals of the Bona Dea, and the consecration of temples; they\r\nwere invited to priestly banquets, and we are told that they were\r\npresent at the solemn appeal to the gods made by Cicero during the\r\nconspiracy of Catiline. They also guarded the sacred relics which\r\nformed the _fatale pignus imperii_, the pledge granted by fate for\r\nthe permanency of the Roman sway, deposited in the inmost adytum,\r\nwhich no one was permitted to enter save the virgins and the chief\r\npontifex. What this object was no one knew; some supposed that it was\r\nthe palladium, others the Samothracian gods carried by Dardanus to\r\nTroy, and transported from thence to Italy by Aeneas, but all agreed\r\nin believing that something of awful sanctity was here preserved,\r\ncontained, it was said, in a small earthen jar closely sealed, while\r\nanother exactly similar in form, but empty, stood by its side. We\r\nhave seen above that supreme importance was attached to the purity of\r\nthe vestals, and a terrible punishment awaited her who violated the\r\nvow of chastity. According to the law of Numa, she was simply to be\r\nstoned to death, but a more cruel torture was devised by Tarquinius\r\nPriscus, and inflicted from that time forward. When condemned by\r\nthe college of pontifices, she was stripped of her vittae and other\r\nbadges of office, was scourged, was attired like a corpse, placed in\r\na close litter and borne through the forum attended by her weeping\r\nkindred, with all the ceremonies of a real funeral, to a rising\r\nground called the _Campus Sceleratus_, just within the city walls,\r\nclose to the Colline gate. There a small vault underground had been\r\npreviously prepared, containing a couch, a lamp, and a table with\r\na little food. The pontifex maximus, having lifted up his hands to\r\nheaven and uttered a secret prayer, opened the litter, led forth\r\nthe culprit, and placing her on the steps of the ladder which gave\r\naccess to the subterranean cell, delivered her over to the common\r\nexecutioner and his assistants, who conducted her down, drew up the\r\nladder, and having filled the pit with earth until the surface was\r\nlevel with the surrounding ground, left her to perish deprived of all\r\nthe tributes of respect usually paid to the spirits of the departed.\r\nIn every case the paramour was publicly scourged to death in the\r\nforum. The honours which the vestals enjoyed were such as in a great\r\nmeasure to compensate for their privations. They were maintained at\r\nthe public cost, and from sums of money and land bequeathed from time\r\nto time to the corporation. From the moment of their consecration\r\nthey became as it were the property of the goddess alone, and were\r\ncompletely released from all parental sway, without going through\r\nthe form of _emancipatio_ or suffering any _capitis deminutio_.\r\nThey had a right to make a will, and to give evidence in a court of\r\njustice without taking an oath. From the time of the triumviri each\r\nwas preceded by a lictor when she went abroad; consuls and praetors\r\nmade way for them, and lowered their fasces; even the tribunes of\r\nthe plebs respected their holy character, and if any one passed\r\nunder their litter he was put to death. Augustus granted to them all\r\nthe rights of matrons who had borne three children, and assigned\r\nthem a conspicuous place in the theatre, a privilege which they had\r\nenjoyed before at the gladiatorial shows. Great weight was attached\r\nto their intercession on behalf of those in danger and difficulty,\r\nof which we have a remarkable example in the entreaties which they\r\naddressed to Sulla on behalf of Julius Caesar, and if they chanced\r\nto meet a criminal as he was led to punishment, they had a right to\r\ndemand his release, provided it could be proved that the encounter\r\nwas accidental. Wills, even those of the emperors, were committed\r\nto their charge, for when in such keeping they were considered\r\ninviolable; and in like manner very solemn treaties, such as that\r\nof the triumvirs with Sextus Pompeius, were placed in their hands.\r\nThat they might be honoured in death as in life, their ashes were\r\ninterred within the pomoerium. They were attired in a stola over\r\nwhich was an upper vestment made of linen, and in addition to the\r\ninfula and white woollen vitta, they wore when sacrificing a peculiar\r\nhead-dress called _suffibulum_, consisting of a piece of white cloth\r\nbordered with purple, oblong in shape, and secured by a clasp. In\r\ndress and general deportment they were required to observe the utmost\r\nsimplicity and decorum, any fanciful ornaments in the one or levity\r\nin the other being always regarded with disgust and suspicion. Their\r\nhair was cut off, probably at the period of their consecration:\r\nwhether this was repeated from time to time does not appear, but\r\nthey are never represented with flowing locks. The following cut\r\nrepresents the vestal Tuccia who, when wrongfully accused, appealed\r\nto the goddess to vindicate her honour, and had power given to her to\r\ncarry a sieve full of water from the Tiber to the temple. The form of\r\nthe upper garment is well shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vestal Virgin. (From a Gem.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nVESTĬBŬLUM. [DOMUS, p. 142, a.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĔTĔRĀNUS. [TIRO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVEXILLĀRĬI. [EXERCITUS, p. 170, b.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVEXILLUM. [SIGNA MILITARIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIA, a public road. It was not until the period of the long\r\nprotracted Samnite wars that the necessity was felt of securing a\r\nsafe communication between the city and the legions, and then for\r\nthe first time we hear of those famous paved roads, which, in after\r\nages, connected Rome with her most distant provinces, constituting\r\nthe most lasting of all her works. The excellence of the principles\r\nupon which they were constructed is sufficiently attested by their\r\nextraordinary durability, many specimens being found in the country\r\naround Rome which have been used without being repaired for more than\r\na thousand years. The Romans are said to have adopted their first\r\nideas upon this subject from the Carthaginians, and it is extremely\r\nprobable that the latter people may, from their commercial activity\r\nand the sandy nature of their soil, have been compelled to turn\r\ntheir attention to the best means of facilitating the conveyance of\r\nmerchandise to different parts of their territory. The first great\r\npublic road made by the Romans was the Via Appia, which extended in\r\nthe first instance from Rome to Capua, and was made in the censorship\r\nof Appius Claudius Caecus (B.C. 312.) The general construction of a\r\nRoman road was as follows:--In the first place, two shallow trenches\r\n(_sulci_) were dug parallel to each other, marking the breadth of\r\nthe proposed road; this in the great lines is found to have been\r\nfrom 13 to 15 feet. The loose earth between the _sulci_ was then\r\nremoved, and the excavation continued until a solid foundation\r\n(_gremium_) was reached, upon which the materials of the road might\r\nfirmly rest; if this could not be attained, in consequence of the\r\nswampy nature of the ground or from any peculiarity in the soil, a\r\nbasis was formed artificially by driving piles (_fistucationibus_).\r\nAbove the _gremium_ were four distinct strata. The lowest course\r\nwas the _statumen_, consisting of stones not smaller than the hand\r\ncould just grasp; above the statumen was the _rudus_, a mass of\r\nbroken stones cemented with lime, (what masons call _rubble-work_,)\r\nrammed down hard, and nine inches thick; above the rudus came the\r\n_nucleus_, composed of fragments of bricks and pottery, the pieces\r\nbeing smaller than in the rudus, cemented with lime, and six inches\r\nthick. Uppermost was the _pavimentum_, large polygonal blocks of the\r\nhardest stone (_silex_), usually, at least in the vicinity of Rome,\r\nbasaltic lava, irregular in form, but fitted and jointed with the\r\ngreatest nicety, so as to present a perfectly even surface, as free\r\nfrom gaps or irregularities as if the whole had been one solid mass.\r\nThe general aspect will be understood from the cut given below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Street at the entrance of Pompeii.]\r\n\r\nThe centre of the way was a little elevated, so as to permit\r\nthe water to run off easily. Occasionally, at least in cities,\r\nrectangular slabs of softer stone were employed instead of the\r\nirregular polygons of silex, and hence the distinction between the\r\nphrases _silice sternere_ and _saxo quadrato sternere_. Nor was\r\nthis all. Regular foot-paths (_margines_, _crepidines_, _umbones_)\r\nwere raised upon each side and strewed with gravel, the different\r\nparts were strengthened and bound together with _gomphi_ or stone\r\nwedges, and stone blocks were set up at moderate intervals on the\r\nside of the foot-paths, in order that travellers on horseback might\r\nbe able to mount without assistance. Finally, Caius Gracchus\r\nerected mile-stones along the whole extent of the great highways,\r\nmarking the distances from Rome, which appear to have been counted\r\nfrom the gate at which each road issued forth, and Augustus, when\r\nappointed inspector of the viae around the city, erected in the\r\nforum a gilded column (_milliarium aureum_), on which were inscribed\r\nthe distances of the principal points to which the viae conducted.\r\nDuring the earlier ages of the republic the construction and general\r\nsuperintendence of the roads without, and the streets within the\r\ncity, were committed like all other important works to the censors.\r\nThese duties, when no censors were in office, devolved upon the\r\nconsuls, and in their absence on the praetor urbanus, the aediles, or\r\nsuch persons as the senate thought fit to appoint. There were also\r\nunder the republic four officers, called _quatuorviri viarum_, for\r\nsuperintending the streets within the city, and two called _curatores\r\nviarum_, for superintending the roads without. Under the empire the\r\n_curatores viarum_ were officers of high rank. The chief roads which\r\nissued from Rome are:--1. The VIA APPIA, the _Great South Road_.\r\nIt issued from the _Porta Capena_, and passing through _Aricia_,\r\n_Tres Tabernae_, _Appii Forum_, _Tarracina_, _Fundi_, _Formiae_,\r\n_Minturnae_, _Sinuessa_, and _Carilinum_, terminated at _Capua_,\r\nbut was eventually extended through _Calatia_ and _Caudium_ to\r\n_Beneventum_, and finally from thence through _Venusia_, _Tarentum_,\r\nand _Uria_, to _Brundusium_.--2. The VIA LATINA, from the _Porta\r\nCapena_, another great line leading to Beneventum, but keeping a\r\ncourse farther inland than the Via Appia. Soon after leaving the city\r\nit sent off a short branch (VIA TUSCULANA) to _Tusculum_, and passing\r\nthrough _Compitum Anaginum_, _Ferentinum_, _Frusino_, _Fregellae_,\r\n_Fabrateria_, _Aquinum_, _Casinum_, _Venafrum_, _Teanum_, _Allifae_,\r\nand _Telesia_, joined the _Via Appia_ at _Beneventum_. A cross-road\r\ncalled the VIA HADRIANA, running from _Minturnae_ through _Suessa\r\nAurunca_ to _Teanum_, connected the _Via Appia_ with the _Via\r\nLatina_.--3. From the _Porta Esquilina_ issued the VIA LABICANA,\r\nwhich passing Labicum fell into the _Via Latina_ at the station _ad\r\nBivium_, 30 miles from Rome.--4. The VIA PRAENESTINA, originally\r\nthe VIA GABINA, issued from the same gate with the former. Passing\r\nthrough _Gabii_ and _Praeneste_, it joined the _Via Latina_ just\r\nbelow _Anagnia_.--5. The VIA TIBURTINA, which issued from the _Porta\r\nTiburtina_, and proceeding N. E. to _Tibur_, a distance of about\r\n20 miles, was continued from thence, in the same direction, under\r\nthe name of the VIA VALERIA, and traversing the country of the\r\nSabines passed through _Carseoli_ and _Corfinium_ to _Aternum_ on\r\nthe Adriatic, thence to _Adria_, and so along the coast to _Castrum\r\nTruentinum_, where it fell into the _Via Salaria_.--6. The VIA\r\nNOMENTANA, anciently FICULNENSIS, ran from the _Porta Collina_,\r\ncrossed the _Anio_ to _Nomentum_, and a little beyond fell into the\r\n_Via Salaria_ at _Eretum_.--7. The VIA SALARIA, also from the _Porta\r\nCollina_ (passing _Fidenae_ and _Crustumerium_) ran north and east\r\nthrough Sabinum and Picenum to _Reate_ and _Asculum Picenum_. At\r\n_Castrum Truentinum_ it reached the coast, which it followed until\r\nit joined the _Via Flaminia_ at _Ancona_.--8. The VIA FLAMINIA, the\r\n_Great North Road_, carried ultimately to _Ariminum_. It issued from\r\nthe _Porta Flaminia_, and proceeded nearly north to _Ocriculum_ and\r\n_Narnia_ in Umbria. Here a branch struck off, making a sweep to\r\nthe east through _Interamna_ and _Spoletium_, and fell again into\r\nthe main trunk (which passed through _Mevania_) at _Fulginia_. It\r\ncontinued through _Fanum Flaminii_ and _Nuceria_, where it again\r\ndivided, one line running nearly straight to _Fanum Fortunae_ on\r\nthe Adriatic, while the other diverging to _Ancona_ continued from\r\nthence along the coast to _Fanum Fortunae_, where the two branches\r\nuniting passed on to _Ariminum_ through _Pisaurum_. From thence the\r\n_Via Flaminia_ was extended under the name of the VIA AEMILIA, and\r\ntraversed the heart of Cisalpine Gaul through _Bononia_, _Mutina_,\r\n_Parma_, _Placentia_ (where it crossed the Po), to _Mediolanum_.--9.\r\nThe VIA AURELIA, the _Great Coast Road_, issued originally from the\r\n_Porta Janiculensis_, and subsequently from the _Porta Aurelia_. It\r\nreached the coast at _Alsium_, and followed the shore of the lower\r\nsea along Etruria and Liguria by _Genoa_ as far as _Forum Julii_ in\r\nGaul. In the first instance it extended no farther than _Pisa_.--10.\r\nThe VIA PORTUENSIS kept the right bank of the Tiber to _Portus\r\nAugusti_.--11. The VIA OSTIENSIS originally passed through the _Porta\r\nTrigemina_, afterwards through the _Porta Ostiensis_, and kept the\r\nleft bank of the Tiber to _Ostia_. From thence it was continued\r\nunder the name of VIA SEVERIANA along the coast southward through\r\n_Laurentum_, _Antium_, and _Circaei_, till it joined the _Via Appia_\r\nat _Tarracina_. The VIA LAURENTINA, leading direct to _Laurentum_,\r\nseems to have branched off from the _Via Ostiensis_ at a short\r\ndistance from Rome.--12. The VIA ARDEATINA from Rome to _Ardea_.\r\nAccording to some this branched off from the _Via Appia_, and thus\r\nthe circuit of the city is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVĬĀTĬCUM is, properly speaking, everything necessary for a person\r\nsetting out on a journey, and thus comprehends money, provisions,\r\ndresses, vessels, &c. When a Roman magistrate, praetor, proconsul,\r\nor quaestor went to his province, the state provided him with all\r\nthat was necessary for his journey. But as the state in this, as\r\nin most other cases of expenditure, preferred paying a sum at once\r\nto having any part in the actual business, it engaged contractors\r\n(_redemptores_), who for a stipulated sum had to provide the\r\nmagistrates with the viaticum, the principal parts of which appear\r\nto have been beasts of burden and tents (_muli et tabernacula_).\r\nAugustus introduced some modification of this system, as he once\r\nfor all fixed a certain sum to be given to the proconsuls (probably\r\nto other provincial magistrates also) on setting out for their\r\nprovinces, so that the redemptores had no more to do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVĬĀTOR, a servant who attended upon and executed the commands of\r\ncertain Roman magistrates, to whom he bore the same relation as the\r\nlictor did to other magistrates. The name _viatores_ was derived\r\nfrom the circumstance of their being chiefly employed on messages\r\neither to call upon senators to attend the meeting of the senate,\r\nor to summon people to the comitia, &c. In the earlier times of the\r\nrepublic we find viatores as ministers of such magistrates also\r\nas had their lictors: viatores of a dictator and of the consuls\r\nare mentioned by Livy. In later times, however, viatores are only\r\nmentioned with such magistrates as had only potestas and not\r\nimperium, such as the tribunes of the people, the censors, and the\r\naediles.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTIMA. [SACRIFICIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪCĒSĬMA, a tax of five per cent. Every Roman, when he manumitted a\r\nslave, had to pay to the state a tax of one-twentieth of his value,\r\nwhence the tax was called _vicesima manumissionis_. This tax was\r\nfirst imposed by the Lex Manlia (B.C. 357), and was not abolished\r\nwhen all other imposts were done away with in Rome and Italy. A\r\ntax called _vicesima hereditatum et legatorum_ was introduced by\r\nAugustus (_Lex Julia Vicesimaria_): it consisted of five per cent.,\r\nwhich every Roman citizen had to pay to the aerarium militare, upon\r\nany inheritance or legacy left to him, with the exception of such\r\nas were left to a citizen by his nearest relatives, and such as did\r\nnot amount to above a certain sum. It was levied in Italy and the\r\nprovinces by procuratores appointed for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪCOMĂGISTRI. [VICUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪCUS, the name of the subdivisions into which the four regions\r\noccupied by the four city tribes of Servius Tullius were divided,\r\nwhile the country regions, according to an institution ascribed to\r\nNuma, were subdivided into pagi. This division, together with that of\r\nthe four regions of the four city tribes, remained down to the time\r\nof Augustus, who made the vici subdivisions of the fourteen regions\r\ninto which he divided the city. In this division each vicus consisted\r\nof one main street, including several smaller by-streets; their\r\nnumber was 424, and each was superintended by four officers, called\r\n_vico-magistri_, who had a sort of local police, and who, according\r\nto the regulation of Augustus, were every year chosen by lot from\r\namong the people who lived in the vicus. On certain days, probably at\r\nthe celebration of the compitalia, they wore the praetexta, and each\r\nof them was accompanied by two lictors. These officers, however, were\r\nnot a new institution of Augustus, for they had existed during the\r\ntime of the republic, and had had the same functions as a police for\r\nthe vici of the Servian division of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTŌRĬĀTUS. [DENARIUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĬGĬLES. [EXERCITUS, p. 171.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĬGĬLĬAE. [CASTRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪGINTĬSEXVĬRI, twenty-six magistratus minores, among whom were\r\nincluded the Triumviri Capitales, the Triumviri Monetales, the\r\nQuatuorviri Viarum Curandarum for the city, the two Curatores Viarum\r\nfor the roads outside the city, the Decemviri Litibus (_stlitibus_)\r\nJudicandis, and the four praefects who were sent into Campania for\r\nthe purpose of administering justice there. Augustus reduced the\r\nnumber of officers of this college to twenty (_vigintiviri_), as the\r\ntwo curatores viarum for the roads outside the city and the four\r\nCampanian praefects were abolished. Down to the time of Augustus the\r\nsons of senators had generally sought and obtained a place in the\r\ncollege of the vigintisexviri, it being the first step towards the\r\nhigher offices of the republic; but in A.D. 13 a senatusconsultum\r\nwas passed, ordaining that only equites should be eligible to the\r\ncollege of the vigintiviri. The consequence of this was that the\r\nvigintiviri had no seats in the senate, unless they had held some\r\nother magistracy which conferred this right upon them. The age at\r\nwhich a person might become a vigintivir appears to have been twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪGINTĬVĬRI. [VIGINTISEXVIRI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLA, a farm or country-house. The Roman writers mention two kinds\r\nof villa, the _villa rustica_ or farm-house, and the _villa urbana_\r\nor _pseudo-urbana_, a residence in the country or in the suburbs of\r\na town. When both of these were attached to an estate they were\r\ngenerally united in the same range of buildings, but sometimes\r\nthey were placed at different parts of the estate. The interior\r\narrangements of the _villa urbana_ corresponded for the most part to\r\nthose of a town-house. [DOMUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLĬCUS, a slave who had the superintendence of the _villa rustica_,\r\nand of all the business of the farm, except the cattle, which were\r\nunder the care of the _magister pecoris_. The word was also used\r\nto describe a person to whom the management of any business was\r\nentrusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪNĀLĬA. There were two festivals of this name celebrated by the\r\nRomans: the _Vinalia urbana_ or _priora_, and the _Vinalia rustica_\r\nor _altera_. The vinalia urbana were celebrated on the 23rd of April,\r\nwhen the wine-casks which had been filled the preceding autumn\r\nwere opened for the first time, and the wine tasted. The rustic\r\nvinalia, which fell on the 19th of August, and was celebrated by\r\nthe inhabitants of all Latium, was the day on which the vintage was\r\nopened. On this occasion the flamen dialis offered lambs to Jupiter,\r\nand while the flesh of the victims lay on the altar, he broke with\r\nhis own hands a bunch of grapes from a vine, and by this act he, as\r\nit were, opened the vintage, and no must was allowed to be conveyed\r\ninto the city until this solemnity was performed. This day was sacred\r\nto Jupiter, and Venus too appears to have had a share in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVINDĒMĬĀLIS FĒRĬA. [FERIAE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVINDEX. [ACTIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVINDICTA. [MANUMISSIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪNĔA, in its literal signification, is a bower formed of the\r\nbranches of vines; and, from the protection which such a leafy roof\r\naffords, the name was applied by the Romans to a roof under which the\r\nbesiegers of a town protected themselves against darts, stones, fire,\r\nand the like, which were thrown by the besieged upon the assailants.\r\nThe whole machine formed a roof, resting upon posts eight feet in\r\nheight. The roof itself was generally sixteen feet long and seven\r\nbroad. The wooden frame was in most cases light, so that it could be\r\ncarried by the soldiers; sometimes, however, when the purpose which\r\nit was to serve required great strength, it was heavy, and then the\r\nwhole fabric probably was moved by wheels attached to the posts.\r\nThe roof was formed of planks and wicker-work, and the uppermost\r\nlayer or layers consisted of raw hides or wet cloth, as a protection\r\nagainst fire, by which the besieged frequently destroyed the vineae.\r\nThe sides of a vinea were likewise protected by wicker-work. Such\r\nmachines were constructed in a safe place at some distance from\r\nthe besieged town, and then carried or wheeled (_agere_) close to\r\nits walls. Here several of them were frequently joined together, so\r\nthat a great number of soldiers might be employed under them. When\r\nvineae had taken their place close to the walls, the soldiers began\r\ntheir operations, either by undermining the walls, and thus opening a\r\nbreach, or by employing the battering-ram (_aries_).\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪNUM (οἴνος). The general term for the fermented juice of the grape.\r\nIn the Homeric poems the cultivation of the grape is represented as\r\nfamiliar to the Greeks. It is worth remarking that the only wine upon\r\nwhose excellence Homer dilates in a tone approaching to hyperbole\r\nis represented as having been produced on the coast of Thrace, the\r\nregion from which poetry and civilisation spread into Hellas, and the\r\nscene of several of the more remarkable exploits of Bacchus. Hence we\r\nmight infer that the Pelasgians introduced the culture of the vine\r\nwhen they wandered westward across the Hellespont, and that in like\r\nmanner it was conveyed to the valley of the Po, when at a subsequent\r\nperiod they made their way round the head of the Adriatic. It seems\r\ncertain that wine was both rare and costly in the earlier ages of\r\nRoman history. As late as the time of the Samnite wars, Papirius\r\nthe dictator, when about to join in battle with the Samnites, vowed\r\nto Jupiter only a small cupful (_vini pocillum_) if he should gain\r\nthe victory. In the times of Marius and Sulla foreign wines were\r\nconsidered far superior to native growths; but the rapidity with\r\nwhich luxury spread in this matter is well illustrated by the saying\r\nof M. Varro, that Lucullus when a boy never saw an entertainment\r\nin his father’s house, however splendid, at which Greek wine was\r\nhanded round more than once, but when in manhood he returned from his\r\nAsiatic conquests he bestowed on the people a largess of more than\r\na hundred thousand cadi. Four different kinds of wine are said to\r\nhave been presented for the first time at the feast given by Julius\r\nCaesar in his third consulship (B.C. 46.), these being Falernian,\r\nChian, Lesbian, and Mamertine, and not until after this date were the\r\nmerits of the numerous varieties, foreign and domestic, accurately\r\nknown and fully appreciated. But during the reign of Augustus and\r\nhis immediate successors the study of wines became a passion, and\r\nthe most scrupulous care was bestowed upon every process connected\r\nwith their production and preservation. Pliny calculates that the\r\nnumber of wines in the whole world deserving to be accounted of high\r\nquality (_nobilia_) amounted to eighty, of which his own country\r\ncould claim two-thirds; and that 195 distinct kinds might be reckoned\r\nup, and that if all the varieties of these were to be included in the\r\ncomputation, the sum would be almost doubled.--The process followed\r\nin wine-making was essentially the same among both the Greeks and the\r\nRomans. After the grapes had been gathered they were first trodden\r\nwith the feet in a vat (ληνός, _torcular_); but as this process did\r\nnot press out all the juice of the grapes, they were subjected to\r\nthe more powerful pressure of a thick and heavy beam (_prelum_) for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining all the juice yet remaining in them. From\r\nthe press the sweet unfermented juice flowed into another large vat,\r\nwhich was sunk below the level of the press, and therefore called the\r\n_under wine-vat_, in Greek ὑπολήνιον, in Latin _lacus_. A portion\r\nof the must was used at once, being drunk fresh after it had been\r\nclarified with vinegar. When it was desired to preserve a quantity in\r\nthe sweet state, an amphora was taken and coated with pitch within\r\nand without, and corked so as to be perfectly air-tight. It was then\r\nimmersed in a tank of cold fresh water or buried in wet sand, and\r\nallowed to remain for six weeks or two months. The contents after\r\nthis process were found to remain unchanged for a year, and hence the\r\nname ἀεὶ γλεῦκος, _i.e._ _semper mustum_. A considerable quantity of\r\nmust from the best and oldest vines was inspissated by boiling, being\r\nthen distinguished by the Greeks under the general names of ἕψημα or\r\nγλύξις, while the Latin writers have various terms according to the\r\nextent to which the evaporation was carried. Thus, when the must was\r\nreduced to two-thirds of its original volume it became _carenum_,\r\nwhen one-half had evaporated _defrutum_, when two-thirds _sapa_\r\n(known also by the Greek names _siraeum_ and _hepsema_), but these\r\nwords are frequently interchanged. Similar preparations are at the\r\npresent time called in Italy _musto cotto_ and _sapa_, and in France\r\n_sabe_. The process was carried on in large caldrons of lead (_vasa\r\ndefrutaria_), over a slow fire of chips, on a night when there was no\r\nmoon, the scum being carefully removed with leaves, and the liquid\r\nconstantly stirred to prevent it from burning. These grape-jellies,\r\nfor they were nothing else, were used extensively for giving body to\r\npoor wines and making them keep, and entered as ingredients into many\r\ndrinks, such as the _burranica potio_, so called from its red colour,\r\nwhich was formed by mixing _sapa_ with milk. The whole of the mustum\r\nnot employed for some of the above purposes was conveyed from the\r\n_lacus_ to the _cella vinaria_, an apartment on the ground-floor or\r\na little below the surface. Here were the _dolia_ (πίθοι), otherwise\r\ncalled _seriae_ or _cupae_, long bell-mouthed vessels of earthenware,\r\nvery carefully formed of the best clay, and lined with a coating of\r\npitch. They were usually sunk (_depressa_, _defossa_, _demersa_)\r\none-half or two-thirds in the ground; to the former depth, if the\r\nwine to be contained was likely to prove strong, to the latter if\r\nweak. In these _dolia_ the process of fermentation took place, which\r\nusually lasted for about nine days, and as soon as it had subsided,\r\nand the _mustum_ had become _vinum_, the dolia were closely covered.\r\nThe lids (_opercula doliorum_), were taken off about once every\r\nthirty-six days, and oftener in hot weather, in order to cool and\r\ngive air to the contents, to add any preparation required to preserve\r\nthem sound, and to remove any impurities that might be thrown up.\r\nThe commoner sorts of wine were drunk direct from the dolium, and\r\nhence draught wine was called _vinum doliare_ or _vinum de cupa_,\r\nbut the finer kinds were drawn off (_diffundere_, μεταγγίζειν), into\r\n_amphorae_. On the outside the title of the wine was painted, the\r\ndate of the vintage being marked by the names of the consuls then in\r\noffice. [AMPHORA.] The amphorae were then stored up in repositories\r\n(_apothecae_, _horrea_, _tabulata_), completely distinct from the\r\n_cella vinaria_, and usually placed in the upper story of the house\r\n(whence _descende_, _testa_, and _deripere horreo_ in Horace), for a\r\nreason explained afterwards. It is manifest that wine prepared and\r\nbottled in the manner described above must have contained a great\r\nquantity of dregs and sediment, and it became absolutely necessary\r\nto separate these before it was drunk. This was sometimes effected\r\nby fining with yolks of eggs, those of pigeons being considered most\r\nappropriate by the fastidious, but more commonly by simply straining\r\nthrough small cup-like utensils of silver or bronze perforated with\r\nnumerous small holes. Occasionally a piece of linen cloth (σάκκος,\r\n_saccus_) was placed over the _colum_, and the wine filtered through.\r\n[COLUM.] In all the best wines hitherto described the grapes are\r\nsupposed to have been gathered as soon as they were fully ripe, and\r\nfermentation to have run its full course. But a great variety of\r\nsweet wines were manufactured by checking the fermentation, or by\r\npartially drying the grapes, or by converting them completely into\r\nraisins. _Passum_ or _raisin-wine_ was made from grapes dried in\r\nthe sun until they had lost half their weight, or they were plunged\r\ninto boiling oil, which produced a similar effect, or the bunches\r\nafter they were ripe were allowed to hang for some weeks upon the\r\nvine, the stalks being twisted or an incision made into the pith\r\nof the bearing shoot so as to put a stop to vegetation. The stalks\r\nand stones were removed, the raisins were steeped in must or good\r\nwine, and then trodden or subjected to the gentle action of the\r\npress. The quantity of juice which flowed forth was measured, and an\r\nequal quantity of water added to the pulpy residuum, which was again\r\npressed, and the product employed for an inferior _passum_ called\r\n_secundarium_. The passum of Crete was most prized, and next in rank\r\nwere those of Cilicia, Africa, Italy, and the neighbouring provinces.\r\nThe kinds known as _Psythium_ and _Melampsythium_ possessed the\r\npeculiar flavour of the grape and not that of wine. The grapes most\r\nsuitable for passum were those which ripened early, especially\r\nthe varieties _Apiana_, _Scirpula_, and _Psithia_. The Greeks\r\nrecognised three colours in wines: _red_ (μέλας), _white_, i.e. pale\r\nstraw-colour (λευκός), and brown or amber-coloured (κιῤῥός). The\r\nRomans distinguish four: _albus_, answering to λευκός, _fulvus_ to\r\nκιῤῥός, while μέλας is subdivided into _sanguineus_ and _niger_, the\r\nformer being doubtless applied to bright glowing wines like Tent\r\nand Burgundy, while the _niger_ or _ater_ would resemble Port. We\r\nhave seen that wine intended for keeping was racked off from the\r\ndolia into amphorae. When it was necessary in the first instance to\r\ntransport it from one place to another, or when carried by travellers\r\non a journey, it was contained in bags made of goat-skin (ἀσκοί,\r\n_utres_) well pitched over so as to make the seams perfectly tight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silenus astride upon a Wine-skin. (Museo Borbonico.\r\nvol. iii. tav. 28.)]\r\n\r\nAs the process of wine-making among the ancients was for the most\r\npart conducted in an unscientific manner, it was found necessary,\r\nexcept in the case of the finest varieties, to have recourse to\r\nvarious devices for preventing or correcting acidity, heightening the\r\nflavour, and increasing the durability of the second growths. The\r\nobject in view was accomplished sometimes by merely mixing different\r\nkinds of wine together, but more frequently by throwing into the\r\ndolia or amphorae various condiments or seasonings (ἀρτύσεις,\r\n_medicamina_, _conditurae_). The principal substances employed as\r\n_conditurae_ were, 1. sea-water; 2. turpentine, either pure, or in\r\nthe form of pitch (_pix_), tar (_pix liquida_), or resin (_resina_).\r\n3. Lime, in the form of gypsum, burnt marble, or calcined shells.\r\n4. Inspissated must. 5. Aromatic herbs, spices, and gums; and these\r\nwere used either singly, or cooked up into a great variety of\r\ncomplicated confections. But not only were spices and gums steeped\r\nin wine or incorporated during fermentation, but even the precious\r\nperfumed essential oils (_unguenta_) were mixed with it before it was\r\ndrunk (μυῤῥίνη, _murrhina_.) Of these compound beverages the most\r\npopular was the _oenomeli_ (οἰνόμελι) of the Greeks, the _mulsum_\r\nof the Romans. This was of two kinds; in the one honey was mixed\r\nwith wine, in the other with must. The former was said to have been\r\ninvented by the legendary hero Aristaeus, the first cultivator\r\nof bees, and was considered most perfect and palatable when made\r\nof some old rough (_austerum_) wine, such as Massic or Falernian\r\n(although Horace objects to the latter for this purpose), and new\r\nAttic honey. The proportions were four, by measure, of wine to one\r\nof honey, and various spices and perfumes, such as myrrh, cassia,\r\ncostum, malobathrum, nard, and pepper, might be added. The second\r\nkind was made of must evaporated to one half of its original bulk,\r\nAttic honey being added in the proportion of one to ten. This,\r\ntherefore, was merely a very rich fruit syrup, in no way allied to\r\nwine. _Mulsum_ was considered the most appropriate draught upon an\r\nempty stomach, and was therefore swallowed immediately before the\r\nregular business of a repast began and hence the whet (_gustatio_)\r\ncoming before the cup of mulsum was called the _promulsis_. _Mulsum_\r\nwas given at a triumph by the imperator to his soldiers. _Mulsum_\r\n(sc. _vinum_) or _oenomeli_ (οἰνόμελι) is perfectly distinct from\r\n_mulsa_ (sc. _aqua_). The latter, or _mead_, being made of honey\r\nand water mixed and fermented, is the _melicraton_ (μελίκρατον) or\r\n_hydromeli_ (ὑδρόμελι) of the Greeks. The ancients considered old\r\nwine not only more grateful to the palate, but also more wholesome\r\nand invigorating. Generally speaking the Greek wines do not seem to\r\nhave required a long time to ripen. Nestor in the Odyssey, indeed,\r\ndrinks wine ten years old; but the connoisseurs under the empire\r\npronounced that all transmarine wines arrived at a moderate degree\r\nof maturity in six or seven. Many of the Italian varieties, however,\r\nrequired to be kept for twenty or twenty-five years before they were\r\ndrinkable (which is now considered ample for our strongest ports),\r\nand even the humble growths of Sabinum were stored up for from four\r\nto fifteen. Hence it became a matter of importance to hasten, if\r\npossible, the natural process. This was attempted in various ways,\r\nsometimes by elaborate condiments, sometimes by sinking vessels\r\ncontaining the must in the sea, by which an artificial mellowness\r\nwas induced (_praecox vetustas_) and the wine in consequence termed\r\n_thalassites_; but more usually by the application of heat. Thus\r\nit was customary to expose the amphorae for some years to the\r\nfull fervour of the sun’s rays, or to construct the _apothecae_\r\nin such a manner as to be exposed to the hot air and smoke of\r\nthe bath-furnaces, and hence the name _fumaria_ applied to such\r\napartments, and the phrases _fumosos_, _fumum bibere_, _fuligine\r\ntestae_, in reference to the wines. If the operation was not\r\nconducted with care, and the amphorae not stoppered down perfectly\r\ntight, a disagreeable effect would be produced on the contents. In\r\nItaly, in the first century of the Christian aera, the lowest market\r\nprice of the most ordinary quality of wine was 300 sesterces for\r\n40 urnae, that is, 15 sesterces for the amphora, or 6_d._ a gallon\r\nnearly. At a much earlier date, the triumph of L. Metellus during\r\nthe first Punic war (B.C. 250), wine was sold at the rate of 8 asses\r\nthe amphora. The price of native wine at Athens was four drachmas\r\nfor the metretes, that is, about 4½_d._ the gallon, when necessaries\r\nwere dear, and we may perhaps assume one half of this sum as the\r\naverage of cheaper times. On the other hand, high prices were given\r\nfreely for the varieties held in esteem, since as early as the time\r\nof Socrates a metretes of Chian sold for a mina.--With respect to\r\nthe way in which wine was drunk, and the customs observed by the\r\nGreeks and Romans at their drinking entertainments, the reader is\r\nreferred to the article SYMPOSIUM.--The wine of most early celebrity\r\nwas that which the minister of Apollo, Maron, who dwelt upon the\r\nskirts of Thracian Ismarus, gave to Ulysses. It was red (ἐρυθρόν),\r\nand honey-sweet (μελιηδέα), so precious, that it was unknown to\r\nall in the mansion save the wife of the priest and one trusty\r\nhouse-keeper; so strong, that a single cup was mingled with twenty\r\nof water; so fragrant, that even when thus diluted it diffused a\r\ndivine and most tempting perfume. Homer mentions also more than once\r\n_Pramnian wine_ (οἴνος Πραμνεῖος), an epithet which is variously\r\ninterpreted by different writers. In after times a wine bearing the\r\nsame name was produced in the island of Icaria, around the hill\r\nvillage of Latorea in the vicinity of Ephesus, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Smyrna, near the shrine of Cybele, and in Lesbos. But the wines\r\nof greatest renown at a later period were grown in the islands of\r\nThasos, Lesbos, Chios, and Cos, and in a few favoured spots on the\r\nopposite coast of Asia, such as the slopes of Mount Tmolus, the ridge\r\nwhich separates the valley of the Hermus from that of the Caÿster,\r\nMount Messogis, which divides the tributaries of the Caÿster from\r\nthose of the Meander, the volcanic region of the Catacecaumene,\r\nwhich still retains its fame, the environs of Ephesus, of Cnidus,\r\nof Miletus, and of Clazomenae. Among these the first place seems to\r\nhave been by general consent conceded to the _Chian_, of which the\r\nmost delicious varieties were brought from the heights of Ariusium in\r\nthe central parts, and from the promontory of Phanae at the southern\r\nextremity of the island. The _Thasian_ and _Lesbian_ occupied the\r\nsecond place, and the _Coan_ disputed the palm with them. In Lesbos\r\nthe most highly prized vineyards were around Mytilene and Methymna.\r\nThere is no foundation whatever for the remark that the finest\r\nGreek wines, especially the products of the islands in the Aegean\r\nand Ionian seas, belonged for the most part to the luscious sweet\r\nclass. The very reverse is proved by the epithets αὐστηρός, σκληρός,\r\nλεπτός, and the like, applied to a great number, while γλυκύς and\r\nγλυκάζων are designations comparatively rare, except in the vague\r\nlanguage of poetry.--The most noble Italian wines, with a very few\r\nexceptions, were derived from Latium and Campania, and for the most\r\npart grew within a short distance of the sea. In the first rank\r\nwe must place the _Setinum_, which fairly deserves the title of\r\n_Imperial_, since it was the chosen beverage of Augustus and most of\r\nhis courtiers. It grew upon the hills of Setia, above Forum Appii,\r\nlooking down upon the Pomptine marshes. Before the age of Augustus\r\nthe _Caecubum_ was the most prized of all. It grew in the poplar\r\nswamps bordering on the gulf of Amyclae, close to Fundi. In the time\r\nof Pliny its reputation was entirely gone, partly in consequence\r\nof the carelessness of the cultivators, and partly from its proper\r\nsoil, originally a very limited space, having been cut up by the\r\ncanal of Nero extending from Baiae to Ostia. It was full-bodied and\r\nheady, not arriving at maturity until it had been kept for many\r\nyears. The second rank was occupied by the _Falernum_, of which the\r\n_Faustianum_ was the most choice variety, having gained its character\r\nfrom the care and skill exercised in the cultivation of the vines.\r\nThe _Falernus ager_ commenced at the Pons Campanus, on the left\r\nhand of those journeying towards the Urbana Colonia of Sulla, the\r\n_Faustianus ager_ at a village about six miles from Sinuessa, so that\r\nthe whole district in question may be regarded as stretching from\r\nthe Massic hills to the river Vulturnus. Falernian became fit for\r\ndrinking in ten years, and might be used until twenty years old, but\r\nwhen kept longer gave headaches, and proved injurious to the nervous\r\nsystem. Pliny distinguishes three kinds, the rough (_austerum_),\r\nthe sweet (_dulce_), and the thin (_tenue_). Others arranged the\r\nvarieties differently; that which grew upon the hill tops they called\r\n_Caucinum_, that on the middle slopes _Faustianum_, and that on the\r\nplain _Falernum_. In the third rank was the _Albanum_, from the\r\nMons Albanus, of various kinds, very sweet (_praedulce_), sweetish,\r\nrough, and sharp; it was invigorating (_nervis utile_), and in\r\nperfection after being kept for fifteen years. Here too we place the\r\n_Surrentinum_, from the promontory forming the southern horn of the\r\nbay of Naples, which was not drinkable until it had been kept for\r\nfive-and-twenty years, for, being destitute of richness, and very\r\ndry, it required a long time to ripen, but was strongly recommended\r\nto convalescents, on account of its thinness and wholesomeness. Of\r\nequal reputation were the _Massicum_, from the hills which formed\r\nthe boundary between Latium and Campania, although somewhat harsh,\r\nand the _Gauranum_, from the ridge above Baiae and Puteoli, produced\r\nin small quantity, but of very high quality, full-bodied, and thick.\r\nIn the same class are to be included the _Calenum_ from Cales, and\r\nthe _Fundanum_ from Fundi. The _Calenum_ was light and better for\r\nthe stomach than Falernian; the _Fundanum_ was full-bodied and\r\nnourishing, but apt to attack both stomach and head; therefore\r\nlittle sought after at banquets. This list is closed by the\r\n_Veliturninum_, _Privernatinum_, and _Signinum_, from Velitrae,\r\nPrivernum, and Signia, towns on the Volscian hills; the first was a\r\nsound wine, but had this peculiarity, that it always tasted as if\r\nmixed with some foreign substance; the second was thin and pleasant;\r\nthe last was looked upon only in the light of a medicine valuable\r\nfor its astringent qualities. We may safely bring in one more, the\r\n_Formianum_, from the Gulf of Caieta, associated by Horace with the\r\nCaecuban, Falernian, and Calenian. The fourth rank contained the\r\n_Mamertinum_, from the neighbourhood of Messana, first brought into\r\nfashion by Julius Caesar. The finest was sound, light, and at the\r\nsame time not without body.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGĬNES VESTĀLES. [VESTALES VIRGINES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIS. Leges were passed at Rome for the purpose of preventing acts of\r\nviolence. The Lex Plotia or Plautia was enacted against those who\r\noccupied public places and carried arms. The lex proposed by the\r\nconsul Q. Catulus on the subject, with the assistance of Plautius\r\nthe tribunus, appears to be the Lex Plotia. There was a Lex Julia of\r\nthe dictator Caesar on this subject, which imposed the penalty of\r\nexile. Two Juliae Leges were passed as to this matter in the time of\r\nAugustus, which were respectively entitled De Vi Publica and De Vi\r\nPrivata.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISCĔRĀTĬO. [FUNUS, p. 190, _b_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVĪTIS. [CENTURIO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVITRUM (ὕαλος), glass. A story has been preserved by Pliny, that\r\nglass was first discovered accidentally by some merchants who, having\r\nlanded on the Syrian coast at the mouth of the river Belus, and\r\nbeing unable to find stones to support their cooking-pots, fetched\r\nfor this purpose from their ships some of the lumps of nitre which\r\ncomposed the cargo. This being fused by the heat of the fire, united\r\nwith the sand upon which it rested, and formed a stream of vitrified\r\nmatter. No conclusion can be drawn from this tale, even if true, in\r\nconsequence of its vagueness; but it probably originated in the fact,\r\nthat the sand of the district in question was esteemed peculiarly\r\nsuitable for glass-making, and exported in great quantities to\r\nthe workshops of Sidon and Alexandria, long the most famous in\r\nthe ancient world. Alexandria sustained its reputation for many\r\ncenturies: Rome derived a great portion of its supplies from this\r\nsource, and as late as the reign of Aurelian we find the manufacture\r\nstill flourishing. There is some difficulty in deciding by what\r\nGreek author glass is first mentioned, because the term ὕαλος\r\nunquestionably denotes not only artificial glass but rock-crystal, or\r\nindeed any transparent stone or stone-like substance. Thus the ὕελος\r\nof Herodotus, in which the Ethiopians encased the bodies of their\r\ndead, cannot be glass, for we are expressly told that it was dug in\r\nabundance out of the earth; and hence commentators have conjectured\r\nthat rock-crystal or rock-salt, or amber, or oriental alabaster, or\r\nsome bituminous or gummy product, might be indicated. But when the\r\nsame historian, in his account of sacred crocodiles, states that they\r\nwere decorated with ear-rings made of melted stone, we may safely\r\nconclude that he intends to describe some vitreous ornament for which\r\nhe knew no appropriate name. Glass is, however, first mentioned with\r\ncertainty by Theophrastus, who notices the circumstance alluded to\r\nabove, of the fitness of the sand at the mouth of the river Belus for\r\nthe fabrication of glass. Among the Latin writers Lucretius appears\r\nto be the first in which the word _vitrum_ occurs; but it must have\r\nbeen well known to his countrymen long before, for Cicero names\r\nit along with paper and linen, as a common article of merchandise\r\nbrought from Egypt. Scaurus, in his aedileship (B.C. 58), made a\r\ndisplay of it such as was never witnessed even in after-times; for\r\nthe _scena_ of his gorgeous theatre was divided into three tiers, of\r\nwhich the under portion was of marble, the upper of gilded wood, and\r\nthe middle compartment of glass. In the poets of the Augustan age it\r\nis constantly introduced, both directly and in similes, and in such\r\nterms as to prove that it was an object with which every one must be\r\nfamiliar. Strabo declares that in his day a small drinking-cup of\r\nglass might be purchased at Rome for half an as, and so common was\r\nit in the time of Juvenal and Martial, that old men and women made\r\na livelihood by trucking sulphur matches for broken fragments. When\r\nPliny wrote, manufactories had been established not only in Italy,\r\nbut in Spain and Gaul also, and glass drinking-cups had entirely\r\nsuperseded those of gold and silver; and in the reign of Alexander\r\nSeverus we find _vitrearii_ ranked along with curriers, coachmakers,\r\ngoldsmiths, silversmiths, and other ordinary artificers whom the\r\nemperor taxed to raise money for his thermae. The numerous specimens\r\ntransmitted to us prove that the ancients were well acquainted with\r\nthe art of imparting a great variety of colours to their glass;\r\nthey were probably less successful in their attempts to render it\r\nperfectly pure and free from all colour, since we are told that it\r\nwas considered most valuable in this state. It was wrought according\r\nto the different methods now practised, being fashioned into the\r\nrequired shape by the blowpipe, _cut_, as we term it, although\r\n_ground_ (_teritur_) is a more accurate phrase, upon a wheel, and\r\nengraved with a sharp tool like silver. The art of etching upon\r\nglass, now so common, was entirely unknown, since it depends upon the\r\nproperties of fluoric acid, a chemical discovery of the last century.\r\nThe following were the chief uses to which glass was applied:--1.\r\nBottles, vases, cups, and cinerary urns. 2. Glass pastes, presenting\r\nfac-similes either in relief or intaglio of engraved precious stones.\r\n3. Imitations of coloured precious stones, such as the carbuncle,\r\nthe sapphire, the amethyst, and, above all, the emerald. 4. Thick\r\nsheets of glass of various colours appear to have been laid down for\r\npaving floors, and to have been attached as a lining to the walls\r\nand ceilings of apartments in dwelling houses, just as scagliuola is\r\nfrequently employed in Italy, and occasionally in our own country\r\nalso. Rooms fitted up in this way were called _vitreae camerae_, and\r\nthe panels _vitreae quadraturae_. Such was the kind of decoration\r\nintroduced by Scaurus for the scene of his theatre, not columns nor\r\npillars of glass as some, nor bas-reliefs as others have imagined. 5.\r\nGlass was also used for windows. [DOMUS, p. 144.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVITTA, or plural VITTAE, a ribbon or fillet, is to be considered,\r\n1. As an ordinary portion of female dress. 2. As a decoration of\r\nsacred persons and sacred things. 1. When considered as an ordinary\r\nportion of female dress, it was simply a band encircling the head,\r\nand serving to confine the tresses (_crinales vittae_), the ends when\r\nlong (_longae taenia vittae_) hanging down behind. It was worn by\r\nmaidens, and by married women also, the vitta assumed on the nuptial\r\nday being of a different form from that used by virgins. The Vitta\r\nwas _not_ worn by libertinae even of fair character, much less by\r\nmeretrices; hence it was looked upon as an _insigne pudoris_, and,\r\ntogether with the _stola_ and _instita_, served to point out at first\r\nsight the freeborn matron. The colour was probably a matter of\r\nchoice: white and purple are both mentioned. When employed for sacred\r\npurposes, it was usually twisted round the infula [INFULA], and held\r\ntogether the loose flocks of wool. Under this form it was employed\r\nas an ornament for 1. Priests, and those who offered sacrifice. 2.\r\nPriestesses, especially those of Vesta, and hence _vittata sacerdos_\r\nfor a vestal, κατ’ ἐξόχην. 3. Prophets and poets, who may be regarded\r\nas priests, and in this case the vittae were frequently intertwined\r\nwith chaplets of olive or laurel. 4. Statues of deities. 5. Victims\r\ndecked for sacrifice. 6. Altars. 7. Temples. 8. The ἱκετήρια of\r\nsuppliants. The sacred vittae, as well as the infulae, were made of\r\nwool, and hence the epithets _lanea_ and _mollis_. They were white\r\n(_niveae_), or purple (_puniceae_), or azure (_caeruleae_), when\r\nwreathed round an altar to the manes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vittae. (Statues from Herculaneum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nVŎLŌNES is synonymous with _Voluntarii_ (from _volo_), and might\r\nhence be applied to all those who volunteered to serve in the Roman\r\narmies without there being any obligation to do so. But it was\r\napplied more especially to slaves, when in times of need they offered\r\nor were allowed to fight in the Roman armies. Thus when during\r\nthe second Punic war, after the battle of Cannae, there was not a\r\nsufficient number of freemen to complete the army, about 8000 young\r\nand able-bodied slaves offered to serve. Their proposal was accepted;\r\nthey received armour at the public expense, and as they distinguished\r\nthemselves they were honoured with the franchise. In after times the\r\nname volones was retained whenever slaves chose or were allowed to\r\ntake up arms in defence of their masters, which they were the more\r\nwilling to do, as they were generally rewarded with the franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\nVŎLŪMEN. [LIBER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVŎLUNTĀRĬI. [VOLONES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVŎMĬTŌRĬA. [AMPHITHEATRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVULCĀNĀLĬA, a festival celebrated at Rome in honour of Vulcan, on the\r\n23rd of August, with games in the circus Flaminius, where the god had\r\na temple. The sacrifice on this occasion consisted of fishes, which\r\nthe people threw into the fire. It was also customary on this day to\r\ncommence working by candle-light, which was probably considered as an\r\nauspicious beginning of the use of fire, as the day was sacred to the\r\ngod of this element.\r\n\r\n\r\nVULGĀRES. [SERVUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXĔNĀGI (ξεναγοί). The Spartans, as being the head of that\r\nPeloponnesian and Dorian league, which was formed to secure the\r\nindependence of the Greek states, had the sole command of the\r\nconfederate troops in time of war, ordered the quotas which each\r\nstate was to furnish, and appointed officers of their own to command\r\nthem. Such officers were called _Xenagi_. The generals whom the\r\nallies sent with their troops were subordinate to these Spartan\r\n_xenagi_, though they attended the council of war, as representatives\r\nof their respective countries. After the peace of Antalcidas, the\r\nleague was still more firmly established, though Argos refused to\r\njoin it; and the Spartans were rigorous in exacting the required\r\nmilitary service, demanding levies by the _scytale_, and sending out\r\n_xenagi_ to collect them. The word _Xenagus_ may be applied to any\r\nleader of a hand of foreigners or mercenaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nXĔNĒLĂSĬA (ξενηλασία). The Lacedaemonians appear in very early\r\ntimes, before the legislation of Lycurgus, to have been averse to\r\nintercourse with foreigners. This disposition was encouraged by the\r\nlawgiver, who made an ordinance forbidding strangers to reside at\r\nSparta without special permission, and empowering the magistrate to\r\nexpel from the city any stranger who misconducted himself, or set an\r\nexample injurious to public morals.\r\n\r\n\r\nXĔNĬAS GRĂPHĒ (ξενίας γραφή). As no man could be an Athenian citizen\r\nexcept by birth or creation (γένει or ποιήσει), if one, having\r\nneither of those titles, assumed to act as a citizen, either by\r\ntaking part in the popular assembly, or by serving any office,\r\njudicial or magisterial, or by attending certain festivals, or doing\r\nany other act which none but a citizen was privileged to do, he was\r\nliable to a γραφὴ ξενίας, which any citizen might institute against\r\nhim; or he might be proceeded against by εἰσαγγελία.\r\n\r\n\r\nXĔNUS (ξένος). [HOSPITIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXESTES (ξέστης), a Greek measure of capacity, both fluid and solid,\r\nwhich contained 12 cyathi or 2 cotylae, and was equal to ⅙ of the\r\nchous, 1/48 of the Roman amphora or quadrantal, and 1/72 of the\r\nGreek amphora or metretes; or, viewing it as a dry measure, it was\r\nhalf the choenix and 1/96 of the medimnus. It contained ·9911 of a\r\npint English. At this point the Roman and Attic systems of measures\r\ncoincide; for there is no doubt that the Attic xestes was identical\r\nwith the Roman sextarius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZĂCŎRI. [AEDITUI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nZĒTĒTAE (ζητηταί), _Inquisitors_, were extraordinary officers,\r\nappointed by the Athenians to discover the authors of some crime\r\nagainst the state, and bring them to justice. They were more\r\nfrequently appointed to search for confiscated property, the\r\ngoods of condemned criminals and state debtors; to receive and\r\ngive information against any persons who concealed, or assisted\r\nin concealing them, and to deliver an inventory of all such goods\r\n(ἀπογράφειν) to the proper authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nZŌNA, also called CINGŬLUM (ζώνη, ζῶμα, ζωστῆρ, μίτρα), a girdle\r\nor zone, worn about the loins by both sexes. The chief use of this\r\narticle of dress was to hold up the tunic (ζώννυσθαι), which was\r\nmore especially requisite to be done when persons were at work, on\r\na journey, or engaged in hunting. The zona is also represented in\r\nmany statues and pictures of men in armour as worn round the cuirass.\r\nThe girdle, mentioned by Homer, seems to have been a constituent\r\npart of the cuirass, serving to fasten it by means of a buckle, and\r\nalso affording an additional protection to the body, and having a\r\nshort kind of petticoat attached to it, as is shown in the figure of\r\nthe Greek warrior in p. 240. The cut at p. 4 shows that the ancient\r\ncuirass did not descend low enough to secure that part of the body\r\nwhich was covered by the ornamental kilt or petticoat. To supply this\r\ndefect was the design of the _mitra_ (μίτρα), a brazen belt lined\r\nprobably on the inside with leather and stuffed with wool, which was\r\nworn next to the body. Men used their girdles to hold money instead\r\nof a purse. As the girdle was worn to hold up the garments for the\r\nsake of business or of work requiring despatch, so it was loosened\r\nand the tunic was allowed to fall down to the feet to indicate the\r\nopposite condition, and more especially in preparing to perform\r\na sacrifice (_veste recincta_), or funeral rites (_discincti_,\r\n_incinctae_). A girdle was worn by young women, even when their tunic\r\nwas not girt up, and removed on the day of marriage, and therefore\r\ncalled ζώνη παρθενική.\r\n\r\n\r\nZŌPHŎRUS (ζωφόρος or διάζωμα), the frieze of an entablature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLES\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nGREEK AND ROMAN MEASURES, WEIGHTS, AND MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE                                       Page\r\n\r\n     I.

In some long multi-page entries with several\r\n  illustrations, a paragraph break has been inserted to allow\r\n  placement of an illustration at a relevant point of the text.\r\n\r\n  The original text used Y with breve (Ῠ) in 49 entry headings that\r\n  were latinized versions of a Greek word, for example ĂLῨTAE (ἀλύται).\r\n  These have been changed to Y with tilde (Ỹ), ĂLỸTAE (ἀλύται),\r\n  because there is no Y with breve in the Unicode Latin tables.\r\n\r\n  There are a few references in the main text to entries that do not\r\n  exist in this (Shorter) version of the Dictionary, for example:\r\n  FURTUM, ATTICURGES, and in the Classified Index there are several\r\n  dozen more, for example: Pala, Follis, Dianomae, Pyrgos.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the\r\n  text, and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n  Pg 24: ‘ἀμπυκτῆρ’ replaced by ‘ἀμπυκτήρ’.\r\n  Pg 33: ‘ἀρχιτεκτονια’ replaced by ‘ἀρχιτεκτονία’.\r\n  Pg 37: ‘corytus’ has been italicized for consistency.\r\n  Pg 42: ‘ἀμφιδεᾶ’ replaced by ‘ἀμφιδέα’.\r\n  Pg 46: ‘by the Emperior’ replaced by ‘by the Emperor’.\r\n  Pg 51: ‘of each parties’ replaced by ‘of such parties’.\r\n  Pg 57: ‘Basilica Portia, in’ replaced by ‘Basilica Porcia, in’.\r\n  Pg 146: ‘have tried causes’ replaced by ‘have tried cases’.\r\n  Pg 150: ‘oath of secresy’ replaced by ‘oath of secrecy’ (twice).\r\n  Pg 154: ‘στρῶματα’ replaced by ‘στρώματα’.\r\n  Pg 157: ‘traduc equum’ replaced by ‘traducere equum’.\r\n  Pg 180: ‘εστια’ replaced by ‘ἑστία’.\r\n  Pg 211: ‘once distinguised’ replaced by ‘once distinguished’.\r\n  Pg 212: ‘be distingushed’ replaced by ‘be distinguished’.\r\n  Pg 215: ‘μοχλόν’ replaced by ‘μοχλὸν’.\r\n  Pg 222: ‘ἀνάκλίντρον’ replaced by ‘ἀνάκλιντρον’.\r\n  Pg 249: ‘ἠγεμὼν’ replaced by ‘ἡγεμὼν’.\r\n  Pg 250: ‘this conventio.’ replaced by ‘this convention.’.\r\n  Pg 266: ‘ἱστός’ replaced by ‘ἱστὸς’.\r\n  Pg 299: ‘In (B.C. 445), the’ replaced by ‘In B.C. 445, the’.\r\n  Pg 332: ‘the downfal of’ replaced by ‘the downfall of’.\r\n  Pg 350: ‘the developement of’ replaced by ‘the development of’.\r\n  Pg 419: ‘gave headachs’ replaced by ‘gave headaches’.",
