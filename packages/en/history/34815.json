Fighting men in dirigibles were a\r\nbare possibility; but nothing more than that. Every amateur building an\r\naeroplane (or even merely intending to build one) in his back garden was\r\na possible \"conqueror of the air.\" The aeroplane was going to oust the\r\nmotor car as a sporting vehicle--everyone was quite certain about that!\r\nBeyond that, nothing!\r\n\r\nTo-day everything is completely changed and except as a war machine the\r\naeroplane is of little interest or use to anyone. A few civilian\r\naviators are still flying, but in practically every case they are doing\r\nso in connection with the business aspect of the question. There is no\r\n\"sport of aviation\" such as the prophets foretold a few years ago.\r\n\r\nAn increasing number of people obtain their pilot certificates and lists\r\nof these are still given, although the title of \"aviator\" is in the bulk\r\nof cases somewhat of a courtesy one, since so few keep on flying once\r\nthey have secured their brevets.\r\n\r\nIt is as a _war machine_ that the aeroplane has come into its own. The\r\nItalian aeroplanes over and over again proved their utility in Tripoli.\r\nAlthough in the Balkan War aircraft were less in evidence than many\r\nexpected, this may be attributed to the peculiar circumstances of the\r\ncampaign and also to the scarcity of available machines.\r\n\r\nEvery country is now engaged in forming its aerial fleets. How far the\r\nnaval and military branches will coalesce, or how far they will\r\ndifferentiate remains to be seen. The probabilities, at present, all\r\npoint in the latter direction, and that just as an army is made up of\r\ncavalry, infantry, artillery, etc., and a navy of battleships, cruisers,\r\ntorpedo craft and submarines, so the sky fleets seem destined to consist\r\nof groups of different types of machines, each type designed for some\r\nspecial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe increased war utility of aircraft has necessitated an extension of\r\nthe pages devoted to organisation of military aviation, etc. The details\r\ngiven are by no means as full as I could wish; but all organisations are\r\nbeing so continually changed owing to increased experience that\r\nsatisfactory data are not very easy to come by.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twelve months or so we have learned at least one or two\r\nimportant things. The mere fact of the possession of aeroplanes by a\r\nnation is a military factor of comparatively little importance. A nation\r\npossessing next to no aeroplanes can easily acquire a few hundreds in\r\ncase of emergency _if she has the people to build them_. The real\r\nproblem is two-fold. First, of course, is the possession of trained and\r\nefficient aviators to fly the machines. Naval and military officers who\r\nhave merely secured their brevets at a flying school are of no immediate\r\nvalue; civilians of the same kind are of still less utility.\r\n\r\nSecond to this is the productive capacity of any country; which may\r\nroughly be gauged from the number and importance of its firms engaged in\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThese points cannot too strongly be enforced. The air strength of any\r\nnation in case of war resides in its efficient flying men and in its own\r\nproductive capacity. The next war will see aircraft quite as much\r\n\"contraband\" as warships, and the nation which relies upon aerial\r\nimports will be foredoomed at once. One month is probably the utmost\r\neffective life of an aeroplane on hard active service and it may well be\r\na good deal less. And firms capable of building efficient machines\r\ncannot be improvised.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature of the last twelve months has been the\r\nrecrudescence of the dirigible, which is now in far greater esteem than\r\nit was a year ago, or for that matter, ever before. In the past there is\r\nno doubt that progress was hampered by arguments between the advocates\r\nof \"heavier than air\" and \"lighter than air,\" and a curious notion that\r\nthe one could only exist at the expense of the other.\r\n\r\nSuch ideas are now dead, and it is recognised that for war purposes both\r\nhave their uses and that both are interdependent. It is not quite yet\r\nrealised how intense this interdependence is likely to be.\r\n\r\nBriefly the present situation may be summed up as follows: the dirigible\r\nhas enormous potentialities for attack on fortified bases and the like,\r\nbut its powers of defence, guns or no guns, are very slight. A single\r\naeroplane should be able to disable or destroy without very great\r\ndifficulty the finest dirigible yet built (supposing it able to find the\r\nairship in the vastness of the air). The damage that a single aeroplane\r\ncan do to land defences or ships is, however, entirely trivial--at any\r\nrate at present.\r\n\r\nHence the aerial war unit already formed in Germany, and likely to be in\r\nexistence everywhere else ere another year or so has passed. This unit\r\nis a dirigible of great offensive powers, associated with a number of\r\naeroplanes presumably intended to defend it and ward off and defeat\r\nattack by hostile aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nThis is merely the crude beginning, it seems reasonably safe to prophecy\r\nthat in the early future the aerial war-unit will be made up somewhat as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) An offensive dirigible, carrying the maximum of bombs, etc.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) One or two dirigibles carrying oil and petrol for the\r\n      aeroplanes--possibly capable of dealing with all minor repairs and\r\n      of carrying a certain number of aeroplanes on board.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) A number of war aeroplanes specially designed for fighting other\r\n      aeroplanes and attacking hostile dirigibles as chances may occur.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) A few very swift one man aeroplanes which will be the eyes of\r\n      the unit.\r\n\r\nThis seems an early certainty. After all it merely reproduces for the\r\nair what centuries of experience have shewn to be essential for fleets\r\nand armies.\r\n\r\nThe matter is a fascinating subject for speculation; but in connection\r\nwith a work that exists merely to deal with things as they are at\r\npresent, is perhaps, better not now pursued further. One point, however,\r\nmay perhaps be mentioned, and that is that victory or defeat in aerial\r\nwarfare seems likely to depend upon which side can first destroy the\r\nother's bases. A base-less dirigible will not live long. This is likely\r\nto lead to very great attention being paid at an early date to\r\nanti-aircraft guns and other devices for the defence of aerial bases.\r\n\r\nReverting to the arrangement of the present edition, a few words may be\r\nsaid about some of the changes. As stated last year the clumsy old\r\nsystem of grouping monoplanes, biplanes, etc., separately has been\r\nabolished. So many firms specialise in both that any such grouping could\r\nonly lead to confusion.\r\n\r\nA tabular system has been generally adopted for most new matter. This\r\nwill be found far more convenient for reference, and of course, saves a\r\ngreat deal of space.\r\n\r\nThe effective age of aeroplanes is somewhat of a vexed question, for\r\nwhile one year probably represents the really effective war utility\r\nendurance, even in peace time, school life is more or less indefinite\r\nand so is ordinary private life. Consequently--although \"dead machines\"\r\nare excluded it has not been possible to draw an exactly uniform age\r\nlimit line beyond that. Speaking generally modern machines represent as\r\na rule detail improvements rather than the complete changes of the past.\r\nFor example, the gap between 1911 and 1913, is far less than the gap\r\nbetween 1909 and 1911. This fact is beginning to make itself felt in war\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nIn Part B an attempt has been made to collect illustrations of\r\naeroplanes of the past which for one reason or another possess an\r\nhistorical interest. This section is remarkable for two totally\r\ndifferent things (1) the early anticipations of some modern practice,\r\nand (2) the past prevalence of certain other ideas which are now totally\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nPart C deals with aero-engines. It is mainly remarkable--in comparison\r\nwith past issues--for the large number of engines which have ceased to\r\nexist. It is probably still too ample; as a year hence quite half the\r\nmakers still recorded are likely to disappear. The mere ability to\r\nconstruct motor car engines is no longer of value. The aeroplane engine\r\ndesigner needs to be a specialist. The absolutely ideal aero-engine no\r\ndoubt yet remains to be produced; but meanwhile the tendency of users to\r\nconcentrate upon fewer makes is increasingly evident, despite the fact\r\nthat the best engine for one particular type of machine is not\r\nnecessarily the best for some other type.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I tender my most grateful thanks to all those who have so\r\nkindly collaborated with or for me in the various sections. The book is\r\nstill some way from being near my ideal, but I have every hope that this\r\nedition will be generally considered a very considerable improvement\r\nupon previous issues.\r\n\r\n                  FRED T.

One of the objects is the perfection of the\r\nAustrian machines and factories.\r\n\r\nAbout the same date, Pola was selected as a naval aviation school, and\r\ntwo _Paulhan-Curtiss_ hydro-avions purchased.\r\n\r\nIn August the record making _Lohner_ was purchased for the Army.\r\n\r\nDuring September Captain Odolek tested before the military authorities a\r\nparachute of his invention; and a number were ordered.\r\n\r\nIn October very strict regulations were issued as to aircraft flying\r\nover prohibited areas, a rule that any offenders would be shot at was\r\nsubsequently modified.\r\n\r\nIn November a _Donnet-Lereque_ was purchased for the Navy and another\r\nordered at the Whitehead Works, Fiume.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Army Section.~\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1911 the Army possessed 4 monoplanes and one biplane (a\r\n_Lohner_), now available for school work.\r\n\r\nDuring 1912 there were acquired:--\r\n\r\n~20 monoplanes.~--1 _Bleriot_, 2 _Nieuport_, 15 _Etrich-Taube_, 1\r\n_Etrich_ limousine, 1 _Deperdussin_.\r\n\r\n~6 biplanes.~--4 _Lohner-Daimler_, 1 _Mars_, 1 _Klobucar_, (of the above\r\nthe 2 _Nieuports_, 1 _Etrich_ limousine and the 4 _Lohners_ were the\r\nonly ones built in Austria).\r\n\r\n\r\n~Naval Section.~\r\n\r\n~4 hydro-avions~ were acquired during 1912; 2 _Donnet-Leveque_ and 2\r\n_Paulhan-Curtiss_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Military Pilots.~\r\n\r\n  Banfield, Ob.

There are two noteworthy\r\ninnovations in connection with the ballonet. (1) The ballonet can be\r\nwarmed by the motor. (2) In case of real emergency air can be pumped\r\ndirect into the gas bag. Experiments of the utmost importance to all\r\nairships are in progress with a view to ridding the gas of this air\r\ncheaply and quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BELGIQUE III. Military.\r\n\r\nPresented 1910 to the Belgian Government by H.M. the King of the\r\nBelgians. 4,500 m cubed. Practically same as II, but has 3 propellers.\r\n~Motors.~--Two 100 h.p. Germain.\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLE DE BRUXELLES.\r\n\r\n(Formerly known as LA FLANDRE.)\r\n\r\n(Astra type.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n~Maximum length,~ 256 feet (78 m.) ~maximum diameter,~ 41 feet (12.4 m.)\r\n~volume,~ 212,000 c. feet (6,000 m cubed.)\r\n\r\n~Total lift.~--15,763 lbs. (7,150 kgs.) ~Useful lift,~ lbs. ( kgs.)\r\n\r\n~Gas bags.~--Continental rubbered fabric, yellow. Ballonet, 16,146 c.\r\nfeet (1,500 m cubed.)\r\n\r\n~Motors.~--2 Pipe motors of 100 h.p. each, placed in line with each\r\nother in the fore and aft line, and with clutches and the necessary\r\ngearing in between them.\r\n\r\n~Speed.~--35 m.p.h.\r\n\r\n~Propellers.~--3, namely: one at the fore end, driven by the two motors\r\nwhen coupled together, and two placed above and on either side of the\r\ncentre of the car, for use when only one motor is running. Chauviere\r\npropellers.\r\n\r\n~Steering.~--Vertical steering by means of a large double aeroplane\r\nfixed above the car, about a third from the front. Horizontal steering\r\nby means of a double vertical rudder above the rear end of the car.\r\nStability is secured by the usual Astra pear shaped stabilising gas\r\nbags, with fins of rubbered cloth spread between the inner edges of\r\nthese shapes.\r\n\r\nRemarks.--The distinctive feature of this ship is the arrangement of the\r\npropellers. Both motors can be coupled either on to the front propeller\r\nor on to the two rear propellers, or on to all three together, but they\r\nare actually intended only to drive the front one. On stopping either\r\nmotor the other is connected to the two rear propellers, which are\r\ndesigned for a slower speed of translation than the front one, with the\r\nresult that the running motor does not find itself overloaded as it\r\nwould if the same propeller had to serve both for one and for two\r\nmotors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAZILIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AVIATORS.~\r\n\r\nGaros, Queiroz, Robert, Henri, Santos-Dumont, Versepuiz.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are possibly one to two aeroplanes in Brazil, but the well-known\r\naviators live in France.

Mervyn O'Gorman is superintendent.\r\nThere are large sheds. Some _B E_ biplanes have been built here, but the\r\nprincipal object of the factory is understood to be repairs and\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Naval Wing Royal Flying Corps, Aeroplane Section.~\r\n\r\nThere is a special Air Department at the Admiralty with Captain M. F.\r\nSueter, as Director, Commander O. Schwann and Lieut. C.\r\nL'Estrange-Malone, as Assistants, Eng. Lieut. G. W. S.

Royal Aircraft Factory, Farnborough, near Aldershot.\r\nFor a long time this establishment had been engaged in dirigible\r\nconstruction and repairs. In 1911 it was decided to expand it in\r\nconnection with the Royal Flying Corps. Its precise functions are\r\nsomewhat uncertain. Its nominal main purpose is the repair, etc., of\r\nService Aircraft. During 1912, however, it turned out several machines\r\nto a design of its own, known as the _\"B.E.\"_ This design was at one\r\ntime regarded as confidential; but subsequently duplicates were built by\r\nprivate contractors, and the design illustrated below, published by the\r\nAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B.E. type.

This company established in 1912, holds all\r\nthe British rights for the _H. & M. Farman_ types. It constructs in\r\nEngland all _Farman_ types at its own works. (See _Farman_, French).\r\n\r\n\r\nAVRO. Aeroplanes. A. V. Roe & Co., Clifton Street, Miles Platting,\r\nManchester; also Shoreham, Sussex. A. V. Roe designed his first machine,\r\na biplane, in 1906. It was the first British machine to leave the\r\nground. He then experimented with triplanes in Lea Marshes, where he\r\nmanaged to fly with only 9 h.p. in 1908-9. In August, 1910, built _Roe\r\nIII_, and in September, _Roe IV_, also triplanes (see 1911 edition for\r\nfull details). In 1911 he abandoned triplanes for the _Avro_ biplane.\r\nSchool: Shoreham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Type D (1911). _Photo, Alan H.

Blackburn Aeroplane Co., Balm Road, Leeds.\r\nBlackburn produced his first machine early in 1910 (see 1911 edition for\r\ndetails). In the latter part of that year he designed the machine which\r\nultimately developed into the _Blackburn_ military. In 1911 other types\r\nwere produced, all being fitted with the patent Blackburn triple\r\ncontrol. School at Filey Hucks has been the principal _Blackburn_ flyer.\r\nThe type has also been very successfully flown by naval officers.\r\nCapacity of works: about 24 a year.\r\n\r\n  ------------------+------------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------\r\n                    |       ~1912-13.~       |        ~1912-13.~      |             ~1913.~\r\n                    |   Military. 2-seater.  |    Military. 1-seater  |         Hydro-biplane.\r\n                    |                        |                        |            2-seater\r\n  ------------------+------------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------\r\n  ~Length~          | 32 feet     (9.75 m.)  |  25 feet    (7.60 m.)  |  33 feet      (10 km.)\r\n  ~Span~            | 40 feet     (12.20 m.) |  32 feet    (9.75 m.)  |  44 & 36 ft.

In 1907\r\n_Dunne I_ was tried on the Duke of Atholl's estate in Scotland, but\r\nfailed to fly, being smashed on the starting apparatus. _Dunne III_, a\r\nglider, 1908, was experimented with successfully by Lieut. Gibbs. In the\r\nsame year _Dunne IV_, a larger power driven edition made hops of 50\r\nyards or so. Early in 1910 the War Office abandoned the experiments.\r\n_Dunne II_, a triplane of 1906 design, was, by consent of the War\r\nOffice, assigned to Prof. Huntingdon, who made one or two short flights\r\nwith it at Eastchurch in 1910. At the same time the above syndicate was\r\nformed, and _Dunne V_, built by Short Bros., was completed in June,\r\n1910. In 1912-13 the Huntingdon, modified, was flying well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------\r\n                               |    50 Gnome.     |                  |                  |\r\n                               |     ~1912-13~    |     ~1912-13~    |    ~1912-13~     |    ~1912-13~\r\n           Model and Date.     |    single-seat   |     2-seater     |     biplane.     |     biplane.\r\n                               |       mono.      |       mono.      |      ~D 8.~      |      ~D 9.~\r\n                               |       ~D 7.~     |    ~D 7~ _bis._  |                  |\r\n  -----------------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------\r\n  ~Length~            feet (m.)|    _not given_   |      ...         |       ...        |       ...\r\n  ~Span~              feet (m.)|  35      (10.66) |   35     (10.66) |   46        (14) |   45      (13.70)\r\n  ~Area~         sq. feet (m squared.)| 200       (18.5) |  200      (18.5) |  552        (51) |  448         (42)\r\n           {total   lbs.

Later this was removed to England, and a general agency for the\r\nsale of aeroplanes, etc., established. This developed, and early in 1911\r\nthe firm was handling a special British agency for the U.S. _Burgess_\r\ntype known as \"The Baby.\" The Hendon Aerodrome was acquired, and a\r\nfactory established, which has grown continually ever since. In April,\r\n1912, a monoplane to special design was completed. By the close of the\r\nsame year biplanes of advanced design were constructed. Capacity of the\r\nworks, March, 1913, was equal to 150 machines a year if necessary.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+--------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n                                    |       ~1913.~      |    ~1913.~    |    ~1913.~    |    ~1913.~    |    ~1913.~\r\n                                    |      Military      |   \"Popular\"   |   \"Popular\"   |    Tractor    |  Monoplane.\r\n                                    |      biplane.      |   biplane.    |   biplane.    | hydro-biplane |   Type IX.\r\n                                    |      Type VI.      |   Type VII.   |   Type VII.   |   Type VIII   | single-seat.\r\n                                    |     2-seater.      |   1-seater.   |   2-seater.   |   2-seater.   |\r\n                                    |                    |               |               |               |\r\n  ----------------------------------+--------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n  ~Length~                 feet (m.)|  33-1/4   (10.10)  | 20-5/6 (6.40) | 26-5/6 (8.22) | 25     (7.60) | 21     (6.40)\r\n  ~Span~                   feet (m.)|     42    (12.80)  | 29-1/6 (8.85) | 38    (11.60) | 42-1/2   (13) | 32     (9.75)\r\n  ~Area~              sq. feet (m squared.)|    435   (40-1/2)  | 230      (21) | 475      (44) | 380      (35) | 208      (19)\r\n                {total   lbs.

Established at the\r\nend of 1908. In June, 1909, it was turned into a Limited Liability Co.\r\nSince then it has been busily employed in producing its own machines,\r\nalso others to inventor's specifications. About the end of 1911 the firm\r\nbought up and sold all the machines of the Aeronautical\r\nSyndicate--_Valkyrie_ and _Viking_ types. It is doubtful whether any of\r\nthese V type still exist--in any case it does not matter. Four were\r\npresented to the R. Flying Corps. Of these one was smashed up, the\r\nothers, one army and two navy, were used to teach mechanics to take down\r\nand re-assemble engines, etc. Handley-Page also bought up the\r\n_Radley-Moorhouse_ machines (Bleriot copies), and disposed of them.\r\n\r\nThe 1912-13 _Handley-Page_ type is as follows--a development along\r\nregular lines of the original H.P. machine:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handley-Page V.]\r\n\r\n~Length,~ 27-1/2 feet (8.40 m.) ~span,~ 42-1/2 feet (12.95 m.) ~area,~\r\n240 sq. feet.

(90 km.)\r\n\r\nRemarks.--The fixed tail area is 32 sq. feet. Body is entirely enclosed,\r\nstream line form. The passenger sits behind the pilot. Mounted on wheels\r\nand one long skid forward. Full description and details, _Flight_, 26th\r\nOctober, 1912.\r\n\r\nPrincipal pilots have been the late E. Petre (who made in it the only\r\nflight through London), the late Lieut. Parke, R.N., S. Pickles, and L.\r\nR. Whitehouse. The machine has been flown with two passengers, in\r\naddition to the pilot.\r\n\r\n~Military work.~--During 1912 five biplanes of the _B.E._ type were\r\nordered by the British War Office. Several monoplanes were ordered by\r\nforeign governments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANDLEY PAGE. UAS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~L~\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE FLYING Co. Windermere. Established 1911, by E. W.

This well-known firm of shed makers built a novel biplane in May,\r\n1910 (details _Flight_, May 21st, 1910), and in 1911 a monoplane with\r\nenclosed body (_Flight_, April 1st, 1911). In 1912, both were disposed\r\nof, and the firm is not proceeding with its experiments. It has,\r\nhowever, a staff of skilled mechanics and a great deal of floor space\r\nfor the construction of aeroplanes to specifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANES. Planes, Ltd., 6, Lord Street, Liverpool. Works: Duke Street &\r\nCleveland Street, Birkenhead. Not building at present. In October, 1910,\r\nthe firm produced a biplane, designed by W. P.

Each station is supplied with large portable wooden-framed\r\nhangars covered with canvas. These can be rapidly taken to pieces and\r\nre-erected. Each station is supplied with its own special motor\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nAll military machines are provided with a compass and map case in front\r\nof the pilot and sketching apparatus in front of the observer.\r\n\r\nAlthough a few non-commissioned officers have been taught flying, the\r\norganization only contemplates the employment of commissioned officers\r\nas pilots. The age limit is 38.\r\n\r\nOn April 16th, 1913, the flying corps was modified. The principal\r\nfeatures of the corps as now existing are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n~Establishments.~\r\n\r\n1. Schools.\r\n\r\n2. Special establishments, dealing with purchase, construction, and big\r\nrepairs.\r\n\r\n3. _Directions._ Administration of _material_.\r\n\r\n4. Depots. A species of dockyards dealing with minor repairs, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Administration.~\r\n\r\nThere are three main groups, each commanded by a colonel. Each group\r\nconsists of dirigibles and aeroplane \"escadrilles,\" and is fully\r\nequipped with establishments, etc. The three centres are:--\r\n\r\n1. Versailles.\r\n\r\n2. Reims.\r\n\r\n3. Lyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n~General.~\r\n\r\nAll squadron units are made up of machines of the same make and power.\r\nPilots are detailed as required to any particular unit, and liable to\r\ntransfer from one to another, though in practice such transfers are\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Army Aeroplanes.~\r\n\r\nDuring 1912 nearly 500 machines were delivered to the Army, but a great\r\nmany old machines have been scrapped. At the end of March, 1913, the\r\nforce stood at 421 effective for war machines, plus an uncertain number\r\nof school machines and obsoletes.\r\n\r\nAbout one-third or more of the effective aeroplanes were _Farmans_. The\r\nrest consisted of all leading French types, proportionated more or less\r\nto the productive capacity of these firms. Also certain other makes\r\nexperimental.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Navy Aviation.~\r\n\r\nThe Navy section of French military aviation is still in the \"being\r\nformed\" process. No data are yet available as to the ultimate force to\r\nbe provided. At present the number of effective war machines is small.\r\nIt is made up of hydro-avions of the following types:--_Astra_, _Borel_,\r\n_Breguet_, _Caudron_, _Deperdussin_, _Donnet-Leveque_, _Farman_,\r\n_Paulhan-Curtiss_, _Sanchez-Besa_, the total at end of March, 1913,\r\nbeing well under 20. There are also two special _Bleriot_ type fitted\r\nwith floats, which carry 330 lbs of explosive, are fitted with wireless,\r\nhave a speed of 140 km.p.h. (85 m.p.h.), and a radius of about 600 miles\r\n(1,000 km.)\r\n\r\n\r\n~PRINCIPAL FRENCH ARMY AND NAVY AVIATORS.~\r\n\r\n(In each case the number against each name is, unless otherwise stated,\r\nthe Ae.

The actual total of machines commenced and completed in 1912 is\r\nnearer 1,000.\r\n\r\nThe number of private aeroplanes--excluding demonstration and school\r\nmachines is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n~PRIVATE AVIATORS~ (brevets to end of 1911).\r\n\r\n(In each case the number against each name is, unless otherwise stated,\r\nthe Ae.

The steering wheel\r\nand the front skid have a spring suspension.\r\n\r\n~Military machines.~--The 1912 sales of these were:--32 to France; 5\r\nBritish; 3 Italian; 1 Swedish.\r\n\r\n~Steering.~--The patented control system consists of a wheel mounted on\r\na pivoted lever. The backward and forward movement of the entire system\r\noperates the elevator: the sideway movement warps the rear edge of the\r\nupper wings, and the rotation of the wheel steers the machine. The\r\nlatter operation also governs the front wheel of the landing chassis, so\r\nthat when on the ground the machine can be steered like a motor car.\r\n\r\n~Portability.~--The main planes can be folded alongside of the fuselage.\r\nThe machine can then be towed on any ordinary road, or be housed in\r\nplaces such as farm buildings, stables, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aerhydroplane, 1913-14.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREGUET.

Farmans_ are of\r\nwood and steel construction; _M. Farman_, wood. In all 1913 biplanes the\r\nailerons are inter-connected. All 1913 machines designed to carry one or\r\nin some cases two mitrailleuse, and special attention is paid to\r\nfacility for taking down for transport and re-assembling. The 1911-12\r\n_H. Farmans_ had elevators forward, were a good deal longer, and had\r\nmore surface than 1913 models. Ailerons not inter-connected. The _M.\r\nFarmans_ generally as now, except that all planes, etc., had rounded\r\nedges. On September 11th, 1912, Foury, in an _M. Farman_ military, made\r\nworld's endurance record to date, 13 hrs. 22 min., covering 631 miles\r\n(1,017 km.) All models of this type, also the \"big military,\" are fitted\r\nwith the Doutre stabiliser. Fabric: \"Aviator\" Ramie.\r\n\r\n~Latest Hydro.~--In March, 1913, a new hydro was produced\r\nexperimentally. There is a boat body, without steps, carrying the motor\r\nwhich is chain connected with the propeller. Machine is fitted with\r\nwheels and skids as well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.

On stopping one motor, the stopped motor is\r\nunclutched from its propeller shaft, which is then connected up by chain\r\ndrive to the opposite shaft. The running motor is then put on to a \"low\r\ngear,\" so that it can make the revolutions necessary for obtaining full\r\npower, while the propellers run slower than before. The ratio of \"low\r\ngear\" to \"high\" is 2 to 1, so that a single motor will be running under\r\nits best conditions when well throttled down.\r\n\r\nA sister, _C.

The mooring of an airship in the open during war requires such\r\nan amount of preparation and attention as to be a serious drawback to\r\nthe alternative plan of keeping such vessels unfilled, while the sending\r\nof an airship back to its distant shed on each occasion means doubling\r\nthe work that the ship is called upon to perform.\r\n\r\nShips of class are:--\r\n\r\n  1.

Major Von Parseval's\r\nfirst airship was selected, and since that time the above company has\r\nconfined itself to improving this type, and to making exhaustive and\r\ncostly researches, all of which have been embodied in successive ships.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of every one of these craft is its unequalled\r\nportability. Almost all other so-called Non-rigid vessels distribute the\r\nload by means of a long girder which also serves as a car. This girder\r\nis awkward to pack up and transport. Parseval uses a comparatively small\r\ncar, and distributes the weight by hanging it further below the balloon\r\nthan usual, and also by using 2 ballonets which are placed one near each\r\nend of the gas bag.\r\n\r\nThese 2 ballonets enable the ship to be trimmed by merely pumping air\r\ninto either at the expense of the other.\r\n\r\nAnother essential feature of the type is the system by which the valves\r\nare worked automatically. At the present time there is no other system\r\nof valve working so reliable as this.\r\n\r\nA third essential feature of the class is the use of a swinging car, in\r\nsuch a manner that pitching, due to alterations of propeller thrust, is\r\nautomatically checked by an alteration of the position of the centre of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nA fourth feature is the use of limp propeller blades. A propeller of\r\nthis type is very easily packed up.\r\n\r\nThe shape of these vessels is in accordance with the experiments of\r\nProfessor Prandtl.\r\n\r\nShips of this class built or building (figures supplied by the Parseval Co.):--\r\n\r\n    EXPERIMENTAL PARSEVAL                             2,300 m cubed.\r\n    P.

Her\r\nessential principle is that she can be taken to pieces in a few minutes,\r\nand carried in a truck. Her main feature is that she has a ballonet at\r\neach end. This is described in the case of type A (_P.L. 2_). This class\r\nrise with the forward ballonet empty, and inclined up by the bow. The\r\npropeller is similar to that of _P.L. 2_. The car also is mounted on\r\nwire runners. She was originally 4,000 m cubed. capacity. Built 1908.\r\nStation: Bitterfeld. The car is at present in Deutsches Museum, Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSEVAL P.L. 2 = P. I. Military.

Made of 2 layers of transverse strips of\r\nrubber proofed material, crossing each other diagonally. Fitted with a\r\ntearing strip.\r\n\r\n~Ballonets.~--One at each end, together amounting to about one-quarter\r\nof the total capacity. Owing to this disposition, the trim can be\r\naltered, and steering effected in the vertical plane by filling either\r\nmore than the other. Pressure in the ballonets and gas bag, 20 mm. of\r\nwater pressure.\r\n\r\n~Motor.~--4-cylinder 85 h.p. Daimler placed at one side of the car to\r\ngive more room. 1,000 to 1,200 r.p.m.\r\n\r\n~Propellers.~--12-1/3 feet (3.75 m.) diameter, 250 to 300 r.p.m.\r\n4-bladed, the blades being of peculiar construction.

(500 litre) cask of petrol on the girders at the after point.\r\n\r\n41 feet (12-1/2 m.) below the gas bag. It is capable of swinging\r\nhorizontally on wires running over rollers.\r\n\r\nWhereas without this device a forward swing of the car would lift the\r\nnose to a possibly dangerous extent, the free motion of the car shifts\r\nthe centre of the gravity forward and so preserves stability.\r\n\r\n~Steering.~--In vertical plane, by altering the trim. In horizontal\r\nplane, by a rudder of 80.7 sq. feet (7-1/2 m squared) immediately behind the\r\nvertical plane.

The hull is built of\r\nspecial 3-ply wood made of Russian white fir; this wood is pressed into\r\nchannel bars, angle bars, and all other requisite shapes. The strength\r\nof the hull is such that it can be supported at the ends without damage;\r\nits lightness is such that although the ship is nearly half as large\r\nagain as _Zeppelin II_, yet the hull weighs about 3 tons less. Designed\r\nby Prof. Schuette.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, structural defects were found in _Schuette I_ when the loads\r\nwere applied. This has necessitated extensive alterations and much\r\ndelay. In 1911 it was completed, and sold for L25,000 to the German\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUeTTE-LANZ 2. Military. S.L. II.

In July, 1912,\r\nit was re-organised along the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  1 command at Turin.\r\n  1 flying work.\r\n  1 technical work.\r\n  2 troop duty.\r\n  6 at the aviation schools, with a certain number of mobile squadrillos.\r\n\r\nThe recognised grades are:--\r\n\r\n  _a.a.p._ aspirante allievo (learners).\r\n    _a.p._ allievo pilota (certificated pilots).\r\n      _p._ pilota militare (superior military brevet).\r\n\r\nIn flying work the superior pilots are mostly using _Bleriots_; the\r\nordinary pilots _Bleriot-Caproni_, _Bristol_, _Antonis_, _Deperdussins_\r\nand _Voisins_.\r\n\r\nThe technical section chiefly supervises the theoretical instruction of\r\nthe _a.a.p._\r\n\r\nThe 2 companies on troop duty practical work, preparation for the\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n~FLYING SCHOOLS.~\r\n\r\nThe military schools are:--\r\n\r\n     ~Aviano.~--Central school. Size about 5x2 kilometres. Sheltered\r\n     from all winds except westerly, by banks of trees. Numerous\r\n     hangers.\r\n\r\n     ~Mirafiori (Turin).~--Mixed military and civil school. Hangers.\r\n     School machines confined to _Asteria_, _Bleriot_, _Nieuport_ and\r\n     _Savary_ types.\r\n\r\n     ~Pordenone.~--School for superior brevets. Treeless plain.\r\n     Principal school machines _Breguets_ and _Farmans_; but some\r\n     _Bleriots_ and _Caproni_.\r\n\r\n     ~S. Francesco al Campo.~--_M. Farman_ machines. At present for\r\n     officers trained in France.\r\n\r\n     ~Somma Lombarda.~--Camp school for _Nieuports_.\r\n\r\n     ~Venaria Reale.~--Formed late in 1912. _Bristol_ monos for\r\n     certificated pilots.\r\n\r\n\r\n~GENERAL TRAINING.~\r\n\r\n50 officers in training during the first quarter of 1913.\r\n\r\nAspirants commence with instruction in the theory of heavier than air\r\nmachines, resistance of material and particular instruction in the\r\nvarious type of aero motors in use. They are taken for flights as\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nAll then go to the training camp about 80% for monoplane work, the\r\nremainder for biplanes.\r\n\r\nMonoplanes. Special attention paid to teaching _Gauchis Dessent_.\r\n\r\nBiplanes. Much shorter course. Principal feature: _Vol Plane_.\r\n\r\nFor the _military brevet_ the examination is most comprehensive, special\r\nattention is paid to flying in wind, manoeuvring, climbing, good\r\nlandings without inconvenience to passengers, cross country flights,\r\netc. The course is generally modelled on war experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n~TOTAL FLYING STRENGTH.~\r\n\r\nNo particular distinction between naval and military aviators.\r\n\r\nTotal by end of June, 1913, to be about 225 certificated aviators of\r\nwhom a fair percentage hold the superior brevet. In addition all the\r\nbest civilian aviators are held at disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Military Aeroplanes.~\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1911 there were about 20 machines, mostly _Bleriots_ and\r\n_Farmans_. The majority of these are still in use for school purposes.\r\n\r\nAt the end of March, 1913, the machines effective for war purposes were\r\nroughly as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Bleriot._        }\r\n  _Bristol_ (mono.) }\r\n  _Caproni._        }\r\n  _Deperdussin._    }   Total _about_ 50, plus a number\r\n  _Farman._         }        of school machines.\r\n  _Hanriot._        }\r\n  _Nieuport._       }\r\n  _Savary._         }\r\n\r\nAbout 40 machines were on order, including 12 _Bristol-Capronies_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Naval Aeroplanes.~\r\n\r\nEffective at end of March, 1913.\r\n\r\n  1 _Calderara_.\r\n  1 _Guidoni-Farman_.\r\n  4 or 5 others.\r\n\r\n\r\n~ITALIAN AVIATORS.~\r\n\r\nMilitary.\r\n\r\n  Agostoni, Capt.

Principal features of these ships, which were designed by\r\nCaptains Crocci and Ricaldoni, are the shape of the envelope, (maximum\r\ndiameter very far forward), keel and the box kite tail. The _Citta di\r\nMilano_ (semi-rigid) is an enlarged _Leonardo da Vinci_ (which see).\r\n_Special feature_ is the keel built into the envelope.

Also the _Avante_ biplane, which also failed. First flight in\r\nPortugal by a Portuguese was De Castro in September, 1912, with an old\r\n_Bleriot_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Army Aeroplanes.~\r\n\r\nAt end of March, 1913, there were several 80 h.p. _Bristol_ monos., 2\r\n_Bleriots_, 1 _Nieuport_, 1 _Morane_, 2 _Vlaiclu_, and several _H.\r\nFarman_ biplanes.\r\n\r\nGovernment school is at Bucharest.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AVIATORS.~\r\n\r\nMilitary.\r\n\r\n  Capsa, Lieut.\r\n  Negrescu, Lieut.\r\n  Protpopscu, Lieut.\r\n  Vacas, Lieut.

First shewn at the Vienna\r\nExhibition, 1911. Modified; it flew very well indeed at Aspern, June,\r\n1912. The 1912 model is of entirely novel type, a tail first monoplane\r\nwith a propeller either end of the main planes, and a triangular tail\r\naft. Principal details are:--~Length~, 34-2/3 feet (10.50 m.) ~Span~, 30\r\nfeet (9.15 m.) ~Height~, 12 feet (3.65 m.) Wing frame in three sections\r\nwith gap between. ~Motor~, 50 h.p., Gnome chain driven. ~Fuselage~, old\r\nstyle; landing chassis on three wheels only, with a single ash skid in\r\nfront. Covered in engine driving the 31 foot propeller shaft for the 2\r\npropellers. Rear tail consists of 2 fixed planes, a triangular damping\r\nplane and a triangular keel plane. Forward, an elevator and two\r\nsemi-circular rudders (double faced). From this combination remarkable\r\nresults are achieved, and all gyrostatic effect from the propellers\r\neliminated. _Control_, horizontal wheel on column. Elevator depressed or\r\notherwise by action on column. Note.--At Vienna, 1912, this machine took\r\nfirst prize for the smallest circle and also for accurate bomb-dropping.\r\nThe original machine was purchased by the Roumanian Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n~General Note.~--In the number of military machines and general\r\nattention to aviation Russia is only second to France. There are no\r\neffective machines of Russian design, but the Aviataka, Dux & Lomatuk\r\nfirms build at home under foreign license, and there is also the Kennedy\r\nschool (Anglo-Russian).\r\n\r\n\r\n~Aerial Societies:~--\r\n\r\n\r\n     (Imperial) Aero Club.\r\n         1.

Vote for 150 aeroplanes (140 to be built at home). Vote\r\n      1,050,000 roubles for new school at Tauride.\r\n\r\n  November, 1912. Military trials results. (1) Sikorsky in a _Sikorsky_.\r\n      (2) Haber in a _M. Farman_. (3) Boutmy in a _Nieuport_.\r\n\r\n  December, 1912. Aeronautical school re-organised. Put under control of\r\n      one commandant, one assistant, and four juniors. Course made seven\r\n      months--15 pupils per school at a time. A one month course in\r\n      aeroplanes, aerial motors, etc. Of the pupils, 10 will be selected\r\n      for aeroplanes. New flying school established at Taskend in\r\n      Turkestan.\r\n\r\n  March, 1913. New schools established at Moscow, Odessa and Omsk.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1911 the total number of military aeroplanes was about\r\n100. At the end of March, 1913, the total number was about 250, of which\r\nabout 150 were modern. Principal types: _Albatross_, _Aviatik_,\r\n_Bristol_, _Deperdussin_, _Farman_, _Nieuport_, _Rumpler_, there being\r\nan average of 20 of each. The majority built under Russian license in\r\nRussia. The number of actual military pilots was 72. There is, however,\r\na special volunteer corps of about 36 private aviators, bringing the\r\navailable total to 108 or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Navy Aviation.~\r\n\r\n  July, 1912. Lieut. Andreadi, 50 h.p. _Nieuport_, did a flight with\r\n      stops from Sevastopol to St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n  September, 1912. Special naval aerodrome for hydro-avions ordered for\r\n      Golodai Island, near Petersburg, bringing total of military and\r\n      naval aerodromes to 6. _Sikorsky_ hydro-avion acquired. Also an\r\n      _M. Farman_ ditto. New naval station projected at Libau.\r\n\r\n  October, 1912. Naval purchase of several _Curtiss_ hydro-avions after\r\n      trials at Sevastopol.\r\n\r\nAt the end of March, 1913, the approximate effective force was as\r\nfollows (all hydros, or capable of being so fitted): 1 _Astra_, 1\r\n_Breguet_, 2 _Donnet-Leveque_, 1 _Farman_, 4 _Paulhan Curtiss_, 2\r\n_Nieuport_ (50 h.p.), 1 _Sikorsky_. (A number of others on order.)\r\n\r\nEarly in 1913 experiments were carried out with a combination of floats\r\nand skids, invented by M. Lobanoff, of Moscow. This proved equally\r\neffective on land or water.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AVIATORS.~\r\n\r\nThe following are army, navy or volunteer aviators. The number is the\r\nRussian Ae. C., unless otherwise stated.

Stefano, with Amerigo, Renzel and\r\nThanlau as instructors.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1913, there were about 12 monoplanes (_Harlans & Reps_), and\r\none or two biplanes. Only one seems actually to have been used. Several\r\nother aeroplanes were captured during the war--generally in their\r\npacking cases unopened. In April, 50 machines were reported ordered in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AVIATORS.~\r\n\r\nMilitary.\r\n\r\n  Fessa, Bey (780, F.)\r\n  Kienan, Lt.

Garcia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S.A.\r\n\r\n(Edited by E. L. JONES, Editor of \"Aeronautics,\" U.S.A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n~General Note.~--In the early nineties, Professor Langley and the Bros.\r\nWright were experimenting with heavier-than-air machines, but general\r\ninterest in the subject is quite recent. Though some small dirigibles\r\nexist, American attention is mainly devoted to aeroplanes. Ballooning\r\nwas quite the thing in 1907-11, but has languished.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that there are certainly no less than _two thousand_ people\r\nin the U. S. A. who have built flying machines. The greater percentage\r\nof these have been home-made copies of standard machines. Individual\r\nbuilders of copies and freaks have diminished greatly in numbers, and\r\nthere remains a few well-established manufacturers.\r\n\r\nAlthough inventors are still prolific in the Patent Office and clubs\r\nnumerous, the general public takes very slight intelligent interest in\r\naviation. The majority of clubs are inactive.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1912 commercial development seemed to have great\r\npossibilities. The copyists were being weeded out and competent\r\naeronautical constructors financed by adequate means began operations on\r\nsystematic business lines. The latter half of the year saw a great\r\nslump. In the spring of 1913 prospects looked greatly improved, and\r\nthere was generally increased activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Aerial Journals:~--\r\n\r\n     ~Aeronautics.~--122, East 25th Street, New York.

S. A. AERO CLUBS.~\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made here to give the name of every aero club that\r\nhas been formed recently in the United States, or has been in existence\r\nfor a long time. It is believed this list covers every club in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMany of these clubs are nothing but a name. They were formed to conduct\r\nmeets or exhibitions, given by the various aeroplane concerns engaged in\r\nthis business. Many clubs are not incorporated. Others have no\r\norganisation, being run by principals of boys' schools or classes.\r\n\r\nClubs even affiliated with the Aero Club of America have no members'\r\nmeetings, nor have they in many cases even meeting rooms. There are but\r\na half-dozen live aero clubs worthy the name in America. Three clubs own\r\nballoons, which are rented to members for ascensions. Little attempt is\r\nmade by more than one or two associations to popularise aeronautics, to\r\nencourage experimenters, or to indulge in scientific work.\r\n\r\nThe Aero Club of America, the Aeronautical Society and Aero Club of\r\nIllinois, are the principal organisations. The Ae. C. represents the\r\nF.A.I., and has a beautiful club house. The Aeronautical Society has\r\nrooms in the United Engineering Building, conducts well-attended\r\nlectures twice a month, and has grounds on Straten Island (for\r\nhydro-aeroplanes and aeroplanes).\r\n\r\nClubs affiliated with the Ae.

MILITARY AVIATION.~\r\n\r\n~U. S. ARMY AEROPLANE SPECIFICATIONS. (1912).~\r\n\r\n~SPEED SCOUT MILITARY AEROPLANE.~\r\n\r\n     (1) Carry one person with the seat located to permit of the largest\r\n     possible field of observation. (2) Ascend at the rate of 1500 feet\r\n     in three minutes, while carrying fuel for one hour's flight. (3)\r\n     Carry fuel for a three hours' flight. (4) Must be easily\r\n     transportable by road, rail, etc., and easily and rapidly assembled\r\n     and adjusted. (5) The starting and landing devices must be part of\r\n     the machine itself, and it must be able to start without outside\r\n     assistance. (6) The engine must be capable of throttling. (7) The\r\n     engine will be subject to endurance test in the air of two hours'\r\n     continuous flight. (8) Speed in the air of at least 65 miles an\r\n     hour. (9) Capable of landing on and arising from ploughed fields.\r\n     (10) The supporting surfaces must be of sufficient size to insure\r\n     safe gliding in case the engine stops. (11) The efficiency and\r\n     reliability of the system of control must have been demonstrated\r\n     before the purchase order is placed. The aeroplane must be capable\r\n     of executing a figure eight within a rectangle 500 yards by 250\r\n     yards, and without decreasing its altitude more than 100 feet at\r\n     the completion of the figure eight. This test to be made by aviator\r\n     alone without carrying extra weight. (12) The extreme width of the\r\n     aeroplane supporting surfaces must not exceed 40 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n~SCOUT MILITARY AEROPLANE.~\r\n\r\n     (1) The aeroplane must carry two persons with seats located to\r\n     permit of the largest possible field of observation for both. (2)\r\n     The control must be capable of use by either operator from either\r\n     seat. (3) The machine must be able to ascend at least 2000 feet in\r\n     ten minutes while carrying a weight of 600 lbs. including the\r\n     aviator and passenger, 150 lbs. of gasoline, and extra weight to\r\n     make 600 lbs. All of the extra weight must be carried on the engine\r\n     section and not distributed over the wings. (4) The fuel and oil\r\n     capacity must be sufficient for at least four hours continuous\r\n     flight. This will be determined by a trial flight of at least one\r\n     half-hour, measuring the consumption of gasoline while carrying the\r\n     passenger and weight stated in paragraph 3. (5) Same as No. 4\r\n     above. (6) Same as No. 5 above. (7) The engine must be of American\r\n     manufacture and capable of throttling to run at reduced speed. (8)\r\n     Same as No. 7 above. This test will be made with aviator and\r\n     passenger, extra weight and fuel enumerated in paragraphs 3 and 4.\r\n     (9) The aeroplane must develop a speed in the air of at least forty\r\n     miles an hour. This test will be made with aviator and passenger,\r\n     extra weight and fuel enumerated in paragraphs 3 and 4. The maximum\r\n     speed must not exceed sixty-five miles per hour. (10) Same as No. 9\r\n     above. This test will be made with aviator, passenger, extra weight\r\n     and fuel enumerated in paragraphs 3 and 4. (11) Same as No. 10\r\n     above. (12) Same as No. 11 above. (13) Same as No. 12 above.\r\n\r\nIn ~1913~ additional requirements specified enclosed body, bullet-proof\r\narmour, .75 chrome steel, for engine and aviator, provision of necessary\r\ninstruments and wireless, with, as desirable features, silencer and\r\ncut-out, self-starter and an efficient stabilising device.\r\n\r\nAt end of March, 1913, the effective Army aeroplanes consisted of three\r\n50 h.p. _Wrights_, one _Wright-Burgess_, several old machines.\r\n\r\nThe Navy had two _Wright-Burgess_ hydros and a few nondescripts. A\r\n_Burgess_ flying boat since added.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estimate for Army effectives at end of the present year (1913) is 21\r\n(5 _Burgess_, 6 _Curtiss_, 10 _Wright_).\r\n\r\n\r\n~AVIATORS.~\r\n\r\n(The numbers after any name is the number of the U.

UAS]\r\n\r\n\r\nCURTISS. Curtiss Aeroplane Co., Hammondsport, N.Y. Glenn H. Curtiss in\r\n1907 and 1908 was a member of the Aerial Experiment Association, formed\r\nby Dr. and Mrs. Alexander Graham Bell. This Association built four\r\nmachines, each along the lines of one of the four engineers belong to\r\nthe Association, F. W. Baldwin, Lieut. T. E. Selfridge, G. H. Curtiss\r\nand J. A. D. McCurdy. The last built was the _June Bug_, designed by\r\nCurtiss and was the most successful. In the spring of 1908, the\r\nAssociation was disbanded and The Aeronautical Society gave Curtiss an\r\norder for an aeroplane with _carte blanche_ as to design. He produced a\r\n4 cyl. machine, Curtiss engine, and flew it. A duplicate was hurriedly\r\nbuilt, 8 cyl. engine installed, and taken to Europe for the first Gordon\r\nBennett, which he won. Returning, the same type was continued with minor\r\nimprovements. Later the front elevator was brought closer in, finally\r\ndiscarded, and the fan tail adopted and this remains the standard land\r\nmachine to-day. In April, a military tractor was built and flown.\r\n\r\nOn January 26th, 1911, first successful flights were made with a\r\nhydroaeroplane, at the Winter camp at San Diego, Calif. This had two\r\nfloats tandem. One was finally adopted and great success was achieved,\r\nand remains standard at the present time. With this machine various\r\nexperiments were made.

Has\r\nbeen successfully experimenting for a number of years with a staggered\r\nquadruplane, and has given the aviation world a number of valuable\r\npapers. His aim is to fly successfully with the least possible horse\r\npower. For several years he has been making flights with various engines\r\ndelivering from 5 to 6 h.p. on careful test. The actual thrust has been\r\nmeasured and recorded in late 1911 experiments. Details in\r\n_Aeronautics_, June, 1909; October, 1909; November, 1910; January, 1911;\r\nJanuary, 1912. No actual details of the machine are available, but it\r\nfollows closely the patent drawings (see references). He is one of the\r\nfew real scientific flying men in the U.S.A.

The experimental machine (also known as the\r\n_A.S.L._), was completed in Feb., 1910.]\r\n\r\n\r\n~DANISH.~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELLEHAMMER (1905). On 12th September, 1906, this machine\r\nmade the first free flight in Europe. On 28th June, 1908, it won the\r\nprize at Kiel for the first flight in Germany (distance, 47 m.) It was a\r\ntractor biplane with a revolving Ellehammer motor. It also had a\r\npendulum seat as a stabilising device.]\r\n\r\n\r\n~FRENCH.~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTOINETTE IV (1909). In this machine Latham made the\r\nfirst attempt to fly the Channel, 19th July, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLERIOT IV (1907-8).]\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the famous _Bleriot XI_ was built. This did very well at Reims,\r\n1909. On 25th July, 1909, Bleriot made the first Cross-Channel flight in\r\nthe machine illustrated below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bleriot XI.]\r\n\r\nThis machine had ~length~, 23 feet (7 m.) ~Span~, 25-3/4 feet (7.80 m.)\r\n~Area~, 167 sq. feet (15-1/2 m squared.) Aspect ratio 4-1/2 to 1. ~Motor~,\r\n22-25, 3 cylinder Anzani. ~Speed~, _about_ 45 m.p.h. (73 k.m.) _Special\r\nfeatures_: Fixed wings with rounded edges. Twin elevator and fixed\r\nsurface tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOUSSON-BORGNIS (1907-08).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREGUET (1906). The first Breguet, known as _Breguet\r\nGyroplane I_.

A large and unsuccessful\r\ndevelopment of the gyroplane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREGUET IV (1910). On its appearance, this machine was\r\ngenerally laughed at and nicknamed the \"Coffee Pot,\" till in Aug., 1910,\r\nit made a world's record by carrying six, and later proved itself\r\nsuperior in stability to anything then existing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAUVIERE (1909-10).

Farman taught himself to fly. It was\r\nthe first machine to make a turn in the air. Won the Deutsh-Archdeacon\r\nGrand Prix, 13th January, 1908, with a flight of 1 minute, 28 seconds.\r\nThe extra third plane was added later. An Austrian Syndicate\r\nsubsequently bought the machine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. FARMAN (1908). Farman's first idea of a monoplane. It\r\nproved too heavy to fly with the power provided.

In 1900 they were making glides. In 1903 they first\r\n    fitted a motor, and on December 17th of that year made a power\r\n    flight of about 250 yards. Reports of this were received with\r\n    incredulity, and right up to July, 1908, when Wilbur Wright appeared\r\n    in France, many people still regarded the Wrights as a myth. Wilbur\r\n    Wright easily beat the French machines in circling, etc. He won the\r\n    Michelin Cup, being up 2 h. 20 m. 23-1/3 sec. Distance 76-1/2 miles\r\n    official record. Actual, estimated at 93 miles. The exploits of\r\n    Wilbur Wright put aviation on quite a new footing. Since 1908 the\r\n    _Wright_ type has been surpassed by others; but to the Wrights will\r\n    always belong the credit of having made a decided step in the\r\n    science. Wilbur died of typhoid, 1911.\r\n\r\nWYNMALEN (Henri). Dutch.

The first Zeppelin dirigible was tried in 1900 on Lake\r\n    Constance. It made a small speed against a 12-16 m.p.h. wind. It\r\n    also circled. The experiments exhausted the Count's resources until\r\n    1905.
