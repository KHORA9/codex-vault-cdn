Presumably he\r\nwould have followed the craft of his father, the village shoemaker, had\r\nnot an insatiable love of music seized him in early years.  He obtained\r\nbooks, and studied them with the village schoolmaster. In particular he\r\nprofited by the “Vollkommener Kapellmeister” of Johann Mattheson, of\r\nHamburg, the sometime friend of Handel.  Like Handel, he found a derelict\r\nClavier in the attic of his home and acquired proficiency upon it.\r\nForkel’s professional career, like Bach’s half a century earlier, began at\r\nLüneburg, where, at the age of thirteen (1762), he was admitted to the\r\nchoir of the parish church.  Thence, at the age of seventeen (1766), he\r\nproceeded to Schwerin as “Chorpräfect,” and enjoyed the favour of the\r\nGrand Duke.  Three years later he betook himself (1769), at the age of\r\ntwenty, to the University of Göttingen, which he entered as a law student,\r\nthough a slender purse compelled him to give music lessons for a\r\nlivelihood.  He used his opportunity to acquire a knowledge of modern\r\nlanguages, which stood him in good stead later, when his researches\r\nrequired him to explore foreign literatures. Concurrently he pursued his\r\nmusical activities, and in 1774 published at Göttingen his first work,\r\n_Ueber die Theorie der Musik,_ advocating the foundation of a music\r\nlectureship in the University. Four years later (1778) he was appointed\r\nits Director of Music, and from 1779 to 1815 conducted the weekly concerts\r\nof the Sing-Akademie. In 1780 he received from the University the\r\ndoctorate of philosophy.  The rest of his life was spent at Göttingen,\r\nwhere he died on March 17, 1818, having just completed his sixty-ninth\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThat Forkel is remembered at all is due solely to his monograph on Bach.\r\nWritten at a time when Bach’s greatness was realised in hardly any\r\nquarter, the book claimed for him pre-eminence which a tardily enlightened\r\nworld since has conceded him.  By his generation Forkel was esteemed\r\nchiefly for his literary activity, critical ability, and merit as a\r\ncomposer.  His principal work, _Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik,_ was\r\npublished in two volumes at Leipzig in 1788 and 1801.  Carl Friedrich\r\nZelter, Goethe’s friend and correspondent, dismissed the book\r\ncontemptuously as that of an author who had “set out to write a history of\r\nmusic, but came to an end just where the history of music begins.”\r\nForkel’s work, in fact, breaks off at the sixteenth century. But the\r\ncurtailed _ History_ cleared the way for the monograph on Bach, a more\r\nvaluable contribution to the literature of music.  Forkel already had\r\npublished, in three volumes, at Gotha in 1778, his _Musikalisch-kritische\r\nBibliothek,_ and in 1792 completed his critical studies by publishing at\r\nLeipzig his _Allgemeine Literatur der Musik._\r\n\r\nForkel was also a student of the music of the polyphonic school.  He\r\nprepared for the press the scores of a number of sixteenth century Masses,\r\nMotets, etc., and fortunately received proofs of them from the engraver.\r\nFor, in 1806, after the Battle of Jena, the French impounded the plates\r\nand melted them down.  Forkel’s proofs are still preserved in the Berlin\r\nRoyal Library.  He was diligent in quest of Bach’s scattered MSS., and his\r\nfriendship with Bach’s elder sons, Carl Philipp Emmanuel and Wilhelm\r\nFriedemann, enabled him to secure precious relics which otherwise might\r\nhave shared the fate of too many of Bach’s manuscripts. He took an active\r\ninterest in the proposal of Messrs. Hoffmeister and Kühnel, predecessors\r\nof C. F. Peters at Leipzig, to print a “kritisch-korrecte” edition of\r\nBach’s Organ and Clavier works.  Through his friend, Johann Gottfried\r\nSchicht, afterwards Cantor at St. Thomas’s, Leipzig, he was also\r\nassociated with Breitkopf and Haertel’s publication of five of Bach’s six\r\nextant Motets in 1802-3.\r\n\r\nAs a composer Forkel has long ceased to be remembered.  His works include\r\ntwo Oratorios, _ Hiskias_ (1789) and _Die Hirten bey der Krippe_; four\r\nCantatas for chorus and orchestra; Clavier Concertos, and many Sonatas and\r\nVariations for the Harpsichord.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, for reasons which he explains in his Preface, Forkel published\r\nfrom Hoffmeister and Kühnel’s “Bureau de Musique” his _Ueber Johann\r\nSebastian Bachs Leben, Kunst und Kunstwerke. Für patriotische Verehrer\r\nechter musikalischer Kunst,_ of which a new edition was issued by Peters\r\nin 1856.  The original edition bears a dedication to Gottfried Baron van\r\nSwieten(1) (1734-1803), Prefect of the Royal Library, Vienna, and sometime\r\nAustrian Ambassador in Berlin, a friend of Haydn and Mozart, patron of\r\nBeethoven, a man whose age allowed him to have seen Bach, and whose career\r\nmakes the association with Bach that Forkel’s dedication gives him not\r\nundeserved. It was he, an ardent Bach enthusiast, who introduced the\r\nyouthful Mozart to the music of the Leipzig Cantor. “I go every Sunday at\r\ntwelve o’clock to the Baron van Swieten,” Mozart writes in 1782, “where\r\nnothing is played but Handel and Bach, and I am now making a collection of\r\nthe Fugues of Bach.”  The merit and limitations of Forkel’s book will be\r\nconsidered later.  For the moment the fact deserves emphasis that,\r\ninadequate as it is, it presented a fuller picture of Bach than so far had\r\nbeen drawn, and was the first to render the homage due to his genius.\r\n\r\nIn an illuminating chapter (xii.), _Death and Resurrection_, Schweitzer\r\nhas told the story of the neglect that obscured Bach’s memory after his\r\ndeath in 1750.  Isolated voices, raised here and there, acclaimed his\r\ngenius.  With Bach’s treatise on _The Art of Fugue_ before him, Johann\r\nMattheson (1681-1664), the foremost critic of the day, claimed that\r\nGermany was “the true home of Organ music and Fugue.”  Friedrich Wilhelm\r\nMarpurg (1718-95), the famous Berlin theorist, expressed the same opinion\r\nin his preface to the edition of that work published shortly after Bach’s\r\ndeath.  But such appreciations were rare.  Little of Bach’s music was in\r\nprint and available for performance or critical judgment.  Even at St.\r\nThomas’s, Leipzig, it suffered almost complete neglect until a generation\r\nafter Forkel’s death. The bulk of Bach’s MSS. was divided among his\r\nfamily, and Forkel himself, with unrivalled opportunity to acquaint\r\nhimself with the dimensions of Bach’s industry, knew little of his music\r\nexcept the Organ and Clavier compositions.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it is not strange that Bach’s memory waited for\r\nmore than half a century for a biographer.  Forkel, however, was not the\r\nfirst to assemble the known facts of Bach’s career or to assert his place\r\nin the music of Germany.\r\n\r\nPutting aside Johann Gottfried Walther’s brief epitome in his _Lexikon_\r\n(1732), the first and most important of the early notices of Bach was the\r\nobituary article, or “Nekrolog,” contributed by his son, Carl Philipp\r\nEmmanuel, and Johann Friedrich Agricola, one of Bach’s most distinguished\r\npupils, to the fourth volume of Mizler’s _Musikalische Bibliothek,_\r\npublished at Leipzig in 1754.  The authors of this appreciation give it an\r\nintimacy which renders it precious.  But Mizler’s periodical was the organ\r\nof a small Society, of which Bach had been a member, and outside its\r\nassociates can have done little to extend a knowledge of the subject of\r\nthe memoir.\r\n\r\nJohann Friedrich Agricola contributed notes on Bach to Jakob Adlung’s\r\n_Musica mechanica Organoedi,_ published in two volumes at Berlin in 1768.\r\nThe article is valuable chiefly for Agricola’s exposition of Bach’s\r\nopinions upon Organ and Clavier building.\r\n\r\nWith the intention to represent him as “the coryphaeus of all organists,”\r\nJohann Adam Hiller, who a few years later became Cantor at St. Thomas’s,\r\nLeipzig, published there in 1784 a brief account of Bach in his\r\n_Lebensbeschreibungen berühmter Musikgelehrten und Tonkünstler neuerer\r\nZeit._\r\n\r\nFour years after Hiller’s notice, Ernst Ludwig Gerber published at\r\nLeipzig, in two volumes, 1790-92, his _Historisch-biographische Lexikon\r\nder Tonkünstler._  As in Hiller’s case, Gerber, whose father had been\r\nBach’s pupil, was chiefly interested in Bach as an organist.\r\n\r\nCoincidently with Gerber, another of Bach’s pupils, Johann Martin\r\nSchubart, who succeeded him at Weimar in 1717, sketched his\r\ncharacteristics as a performer in the _Aesthetik der Tonkunst_, published\r\nat Berlin by his son in the _Deutschen Monatsschrift_ in 1793.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 appeared at Leipzig the first volume of a work which Spitta\r\ncharacterises as fantastic and unreliable, so far as it deals with Bach,\r\nFriedrich Carl Gottlieb Hirsching’s _Historisch-literarisches Handbuch_ of\r\nnotable persons deceased in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nLast of Forkel’s forerunners, A. E. L. Siebigke published at Breslau in\r\n1801 his _Museum deutscher Tonkünstler,_ a work which adds nothing to our\r\nknowledge of Bach’s life, but offers some remarks on his style.\r\n\r\nLittle, if any, information of value, therefore, had been added to the\r\n_Nekrolog_ of 1754 when Forkel, in 1802, produced his monograph on Bach\r\nand his music.  Nor, viewed as a biography, does Forkel much enlarge our\r\nknowledge of the conditions of Bach’s life.  He had the advantage of\r\nknowing Bach’s elder sons, but appears to have lacked curiosity regarding\r\nthe circumstances of Bach’s career, and to have made no endeavour to add\r\nto his imperfect information, even regarding his hero’s life at Leipzig,\r\nupon which it should have been easy for him to obtain details of utmost\r\ninterest.  His monograph, in fact, is not a “Life” in the biographic\r\nsense, but a critical appreciation of Bach as player, teacher, and\r\ncomposer, based upon the Organ and Clavier works, with which alone Forkel\r\nwas familiar.\r\n\r\nIt would be little profitable to weigh the value of Forkel’s criticism.\r\nWe are tempted to the conclusion that Bach appealed to him chiefly as a\r\nsupreme master of technique, and our hearts would open to him more widely\r\ndid not his appreciation of Bach march with a narrow depreciation of\r\nHaydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, the last of whom, he declared ex cathedra,\r\nhad not produced “a single work which can be called a masterpiece.” Gluck\r\nhe frankly detested.\r\n\r\nBut Forkel’s monograph is notable on other grounds.  It was the first to\r\nclaim for Bach a place among the divinities.  It used him to stimulate a\r\nnational sense in his own people. Bach’s is the first great voice from out\r\nof Germany since Luther.  Of Germany’s own Kisorgimento, patently\r\ninitiated by Goethe a generation after Johann Sebastian’s death, Bach\r\nhimself is the harbinger.  In his assertion of a distinctive German\r\nmusical art he set an example followed in turn by Mozart, Weber, and\r\nWagner.  “With Bach,” wrote Wagner, “the German Spirit was born anew.”  It\r\nis Forkel’s perpetual distinction that he grasped a fact hidden from\r\nalmost all but himself.  In his Preface, and more emphatically in the\r\nclosing paragraph of his last Chapter, he presents Bach as the herald of a\r\nGerman nation yet unformed.\r\n\r\nIt is a farther distinction of Forkel’s monograph that it made converts.\r\nWith its publication the clouds of neglect that too long had obscured\r\nBach’s grandeur began to melt away, until the dizzy altitude of his genius\r\nstood revealed.  The publication of the five Motets (1803) was followed by\r\nthat of the Magnificat in 1811, and of the Mass in A in 1818.  A beginning\r\nwas made with the Cantatas in 1821, when Breitkopf and Haertel published\r\n“Ein’ feste Burg” (No. 80), commended in an article written (1822) by\r\nJohann Friedrich Rochlitz (1769-1842), the champion of Beethoven, as now\r\nof Bach.  Another enthusiastic pioneer was Carl Friedrich Zelter\r\n(1758-1832), conductor of the Berlin Sing-Akademie, who called Bach “a\r\nsign of God, clear, yet inexplicable.” To him in large measure was due the\r\nmemorable revival of the _St. Matthew Passion_ at Berlin, which the\r\nyouthful Mendelssohn, Zelter’s pupil, conducted in March 1829, exactly one\r\nhundred years after the first production of the mighty work at Leipzig.\r\nIn the following years it was given at Dresden and many other German\r\ntowns. Leipzig heard it again after a barren interval in 1841, and did\r\ntardy homage to its incomparable composer by erecting (1843) the statue\r\nthat stands in the shadow of St. Thomas’s Church, hard by the Cantor’s\r\nhome for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1830 and 1831 the _St. Matthew Passion_ and _St. John\r\nPassion_ had been engraved, and by 1845 the B minor Mass was in print.\r\nThe credit of having revived it belongs to Johann Nepomuk Schelble\r\n(1789-1837), conductor of the Frankfort Caecilienverein, though the Berlin\r\nSing-Akademie was the first to give a performance, considerably curtailed,\r\nof the whole work in 1835. A little later, in the middle of the forties,\r\nPeters began to issue his “kritisch-korrecte” edition of the Organ works,\r\nwhich at length made Bach widely known among organists.  But the\r\npublication of the Cantatas proceeded slowly.  Only fourteen of them were\r\nin print in 1850, when the foundation of the Bachgesellschaft, on the\r\ncentenary of Bach’s death, focused a world-wide homage. When it dissolved\r\nin 1900 its mission was accomplished, the entire works(2) of Bach were\r\npublished, and the vast range of his genius was patent to the world.\r\n\r\nIt remains to discuss the first English version of Forkel’s monograph,\r\npublished in 1820, with the following title-page:\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIFE OF JOHN SEBASTIAN BACH; with a Critical View of his\r\n    Compositions. By J. N. Forkel, Author of The Complete History of\r\n    Music, etc., etc. Translated from the German.  London: Printed for\r\n    T. Boosey and Co., Holles-Street, Cavendish-Square. 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book was published in February 1820; it was announced, with a slightly\r\ndifferently worded title-page, in the _New Monthly Magazine and Universal\r\nRegister_ for March 1820 (p. 341), and the _Scots Magazine_ for the same\r\nmonth ( vol. lxxxv. p. 263).  The _New Monthly_ states the price as 5s.,\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_ (vol. xxiii. p. 281) as 6s.  The book contains\r\nxi+116+3 pages of Music Figures, crown octavo, bound in dark unlettered\r\ncloth.  It has neither Introduction, notes (other than Forkel’s), nor\r\nindication of the translator’s identity.  Much of the translation is so\r\nbad as to suggest grave doubts of the translator’s comprehension of the\r\nGerman original; while his rendering of Forkel’s critical chapters rouses\r\na strong suspicion that he also lacked technical equipment adequate to his\r\ntask.  It is, in fact, difficult to understand how such an unsatisfactory\r\npiece of work found its way into print.\r\n\r\nThe character of the 1820 translation has a close bearing upon its\r\nauthorship.  In the article on Bach in the new _Grove_ it is attributed to\r\nSamuel Wesley (1766-1837), an attractive suggestion, since Wesley was as\r\nenthusiastic a Bach pioneer in this country as Forkel himself was in\r\nGermany. But the statement is not correct.  In Samuel Wesley’s _Letters to\r\nMr. Jacobs relating to the Introduction into this Country of the Works of\r\nJ. S. Bach_ (London, 1875) we find the clue.  On October 17, 1808, Wesley\r\nwrites: “We are (in the first place) preparing for the Press an authentic\r\nand accurate Life of Sebastian, which Mr. Stephenson the Banker (a most\r\nzealous and scientific member of our Fraternity) has translated into\r\nEnglish from the German of Forkel.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to identify Stephenson precisely, or to\r\ndetect his activities in the musical circle in which Wesley includes him.\r\nIn 1820 there was in Lombard Street a firm of bankers under the style of\r\n“Remington, Stephenson, Remington, and Toulmin,” the active partner being\r\nMr. Rowland Stephenson, a man of about forty in that year.  The firm was\r\nwound up in bankruptcy in 1829, Stephenson having absconded to America the\r\nprevious year.  He appears to have been the only banker of that name\r\nholding such a recognised position as Wesley attributes to him, though it\r\nremains no more than a conjecture that he was the author of the\r\ntranslation issued in 1820.(3) But whoever “Stephenson the Banker” may\r\nhave been, the poverty of his work fails to support Wesley’s commendation\r\nof his “scientific” equipment, and suggests that his purse rather than his\r\ntalents were serviceable to Wesley’s missionary campaign.\r\n\r\nFor the facts of Bach’s life, and as a record of his artistic activities,\r\nForkel admittedly is inadequate and often misleading.  Stephenson\r\nnecessarily was without information to enable him to correct or supplement\r\nhis author.  Recent research, and particularly the classic volumes of\r\nSpitta and Schweitzer, have placed the present generation in a more\r\ninstructed and therefore responsible position.  The following pages,\r\naccordingly, have been annotated copiously in order to bring Forkel into\r\nline with modern scholarship. His own infrequent notes are invariably\r\nindicated by a prefixed asterisk.  It has been thought advisable to write\r\nan addendum to Chapter II. in order to supplement Forkel at the weakest\r\npoint of his narrative.\r\n\r\nReaders of Spitta’s first volume probably will remember the effort to\r\nfollow the ramifications of the Bach pedigree unaided by a genealogical\r\nTable.  It is unfortunate that Spitta did not set out in that form the\r\nwealth of biographical material his pages contain.  To supply the\r\ndeficiency, and to illustrate Forkel’s first Chapter, a complete\r\nGenealogical Table is provided in Appendix VI., based mainly upon the\r\nbiographical details scattered over Spitta’s pages.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IX. Forkel gives a list of Bach’s compositions known to him.\r\nIt is, necessarily, incomplete.  For that reason Appendices I. and II.\r\nprovide a full catalogue of Bach’s works arranged under the periods of his\r\ncareer.  In the case of the Oratorios, Cantatas, Motets, and “Passions,”\r\nit is not difficult to distribute them upon a chronological basis.  The\r\nClavier works also can be dated with some approximation to closeness.  The\r\neffort is more speculative in the case of the Organ music.\r\n\r\nIn his Preface Forkel suggests the institution of a Society for the\r\npublication and study of Bach’s works.  The proposal was adopted after\r\nhalf a century’s interval, and in Appendix III. will be found a complete\r\nand detailed catalogue of the publications of the Old and New\r\nBachgesellschaft from 1850 to 1918 inclusive.  The Society’s issues for\r\n1915-18 have not yet reached this country. The present writer had an\r\nopportunity to examine them in the Library of the Cologne Conservatorium\r\nof Music in the spring of this year.\r\n\r\nIn this Introduction will be found a list of works bearing on Bach, which\r\npreceded Forkel’s monograph.  Appendix IV. provides a bibliography of Bach\r\nliterature published subsequently to it.\r\n\r\nGrateful acknowledgment is made to Mr. Ivor Atkins, of Worcester\r\nCathedral, and to Mr. W. G. Whittaker, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who have\r\nread these pages in proof, and improved them by their criticism.\r\n\r\n                                                                  C. S. T.\r\nOctober 1, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORKEL’S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago I determined to give the public an account of the life of\r\nJohann Sebastian Bach, with some reflections upon his genius and his\r\nworks.  The brief article by Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach(4) and Herr\r\nAgricola,(5) formerly composer to the Court of Prussia, contributed to the\r\nfourth volume of Mizler’s _Musical Library,_(6) can hardly be deemed\r\nadequate by Bach’s admirers and, but for the desire to complete my\r\n_General History of Music,_(7) I should have fulfilled my purpose long\r\nago.  As Bach, more than any other artist, represents an era in the\r\nhistory of music, it was my intention to devote to the concluding volume\r\nof that work the materials I had collected for a history of his career.\r\nBut the announcement that Messrs. Hoffmeister and Kühnel, the Leipzig\r\nmusic-sellers and publishers, propose to issue a complete and critical\r\nedition of Bach’s works has induced me to change my original plan.(8)\r\n\r\nMessrs. Hoffmeister and Künel’s project promises at once to advance the\r\nart of music and enhance the honour of the German name.  For Bach’s works\r\nare a priceless national patrimony; no other nation possesses a treasure\r\ncomparable to it.  Their publication in an authoritative text will be a\r\nnational service and raise an imperishable monument to the composer\r\nhimself.  All who hold Germany dear are bound in honour to promote the\r\nundertaking to the utmost of their power.  I deem it a duty to remind the\r\npublic of this obligation and to kindle interest in it in every true\r\nGerman heart.  To that end these pages appear earlier than my original\r\nplan proposed; for they will enable me to reach a larger number of my\r\nfellow countrymen.  The section on Bach in my _History of Music_ probably\r\nwould have been read by a handful of experts or musical artists.  Here I\r\nhope to speak to a larger audience. For, let me repeat, not merely the\r\ninterests of music but our national honour are concerned to rescue from\r\noblivion the memory of one of Germany’s greatest sons.\r\n\r\nOne of the best and most effective means of popularising musical\r\nmasterpieces is to perform them in public.  In that way works of merit\r\nsecure a widening audience.  People listen to them with pleasure in the\r\nconcert room, church, or theatre, remember the agreeable impression they\r\ncreated, and purchase them when published, even though they cannot always\r\nplay them.  But Bach’s works unfortunately are rarely heard nowadays; for\r\nthe number of persons capable of playing them adequately is at best\r\ninconsiderable. It would have been otherwise had Bach given touring\r\nperformances of his music,(9) a labour for which he had neither time nor\r\nliking. Many of his pupils did so, and though their skill was inferior to\r\ntheir master’s, the admiration and astonishment they excited revealed the\r\ngrandeur of his compositions.  Here and there, too, were found persons who\r\ndesired to hear on their own instrument pieces which the performer had\r\nplayed best or gave them most pleasure. They could do so more easily for\r\nhaving heard how the piece ought to sound.\r\n\r\nBut, to awaken a wide appreciation of musical masterpieces depends upon\r\nthe existence of good teachers.  The want of them is our chief difficulty.\r\nIn order to safeguard their credit, the ignorant and incompetent of their\r\nnumber are disposed to decry good music, lest they should be asked to play\r\nit.  Consequently, their pupils, condemned to spend time, labour, and\r\nmoney on second-rate material, will not after half a dozen years, perhaps,\r\nshow themselves farther advanced in sound musical appreciation than they\r\nwere at the outset.  Whereas, under a good teacher, half the time, labour,\r\nand money produces progressive improvement.  Time will show whether this\r\nobstacle can be surmounted by making Bach’s works accessible in the music\r\nshops and by forming a Society among the admirers of his genius to make\r\nthem known and promote their study.(10)\r\n\r\nAt any rate, if music is really an art, and not a mere pastime, its\r\nmasterpieces must be more widely known and performed than in fact they\r\nare.  And here Bach, prince of classic composers, can render yeoman\r\nservice.(11) For his music is so well calculated to educate the student to\r\ndistinguish what is trivial from what is good, and to comport himself as\r\nan artist in whatever branch of the art he makes his own.  Moreover, Bach,\r\nwhose influence pervades every musical form, can be relied on more than\r\nany other composer to correct the superficiality which is the bane of\r\nmodern taste.  Neglect of the classics is as prejudicial to the art of\r\nmusic as it would be fatal to the interests of general culture to banish\r\nGreek and Latin writers from our schools.  Modern taste exhibits no shame\r\nin its preference for agreeable trifles, in its neglect of everything that\r\nmakes a demand, however slight, upon its attention.  To-day we are menaced\r\nby a proposal to banish the classics from our schoolrooms. Equally\r\nshort-sighted vision threatens to extinguish our musical classics as well.\r\nAnd is it surprising?  Modern art displays such poverty and frivolity that\r\nit well may shrink from putting itself in context with great literature,\r\nparticularly with Bach’s mighty and creative genius, and seek rather to\r\nproscribe it.\r\n\r\nI fain would do justice to the sublime genius of this prince of musicians,\r\nGerman and foreign! Short of being such a man as he was, dwarfing all\r\nother musicians from the height of his superiority, I can conceive no\r\ngreater distinction than the power to comprehend and interpret him to\r\nothers.(12) The ability to do so must at least connote a temperament not\r\nwholly alien from his own. It may even hint the flattering prospect that,\r\nif circumstances had opened up the same career, similar results might have\r\nbeen forthcoming.  I am not presumptuous to suggest such a result in my\r\nown case.  On the contrary I am convinced that there are no words adequate\r\nto express the thoughts Bach’s transcendent genius stirs one to utter.\r\nThe more intimately we are acquainted with it the greater must be our\r\nadmiration.  Our utmost eulogy, our deepest expressions of homage, must\r\nseem little more than well-meant prattle. No one who is familiar with the\r\nwork of other centuries will contradict or hold my statement exaggerated,\r\nthat Bach cannot be named except in tones of rapture, and even of devout\r\nawe, by those who have learnt to know him.  We may discover and lay bare\r\nthe secrets of his technique. But his power to inspire into it the breath\r\nof genius, the perfection of life and charm that moves us so powerfully,\r\neven in his slightest works, must always remain extraordinary and\r\ninsoluble.\r\n\r\nI do not choose to compare Bach with other artists.  Whoever is interested\r\nto measure him with Handel will find a just and balanced estimate of their\r\nrelative merits, written by one fully informed for the task, in the first\r\nnumber of the eighty-first volume of the _Universal German Library,_ pages\r\n295-303.(13)\r\n\r\nSo far as it is not derived from the short article in Mizler’s _Library_\r\nalready mentioned,(14) I am indebted for my information to the two eldest\r\nsons of Bach himself.(15) Not only was I personally acquainted with them,\r\nbut I corresponded regularly for many years with both,(16) particularly\r\nCarl Philipp Emmanuel.  The world knows them as great artists.  But\r\nprobably it is not aware that to the last moment of their lives they spoke\r\nof their father’s genius with enthusiastic admiration.(17) From my early\r\nyouth I have been inspired by an appreciation no less deep than theirs. It\r\nwas a frequent theme of conversation and correspondence between us.\r\n\r\nThus, having been in a position to inform myself on all matters relating\r\nto Bach’s life, genius, and work, I may fairly hold myself competent to\r\ncommunicate to the public what I have learnt and to offer useful\r\nreflections upon it.  I take advantage of my opportunity the more readily\r\nbecause it permits me to draw attention to an enterprise(18) that promises\r\nto provide a worthy monument to German art, a gallery of most instructive\r\nmodels to the sincere artist, and to afford music lovers an inexhaustible\r\nsource of sublimest pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE FAMILY OF BACH\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is such a thing as inherited aptitude for art it certainly showed\r\nitself in the family of Bach. For six successive generations scarcely two\r\nor three of its members are found whom nature had not endowed with\r\nremarkable musical talent, and who did not make music their\r\nprofession.(19)\r\n\r\nVeit Bach,(20) ancestor of this famous family, gained a livelihood as a\r\nbaker at Pressburg in Hungary.  When the religious troubles of the\r\nsixteenth century broke out he was driven to seek another place of abode,\r\nand having got together as much of his small property as he could, retired\r\nwith it to Thuringia, hoping to find peace and security there.  He settled\r\nat Wechmar, a village near Gotha,(21) where he continued to ply his trade\r\nas a baker and miller.(22) In his leisure hours he was wont to amuse\r\nhimself with the lute,(23) playing it amid the noise and clatter of the\r\nmill.  His taste for music descended to his two sons(24) and their\r\nchildren, and in time the Bachs grew to be a very numerous family of\r\nprofessional musicians, Cantors, Organists, and Town Musicians,(25)\r\nthroughout  Thuringia.\r\n\r\nNot all the Bachs, however, were great musicians. But every generation\r\nboasted some of them who were more than usually distinguished.  In the\r\nfirst quarter of the seventeenth century three of Veit Bach’s\r\ngrandchildren showed such exceptional talent that the Count of\r\nSchwarzburg-Arnstadt thought it worth while to send them at his expense to\r\nItaly, then the chief school of music, to perfect themselves in the\r\nart.(26)\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether they rewarded the expectations of their patron, for\r\nnone of their works has survived. The fourth generation(27) of the family\r\nproduced musicians of exceptional distinction, and several of their\r\ncompositions, thanks to Johann Sebastian Bach’s regard for them, have come\r\ndown to us. The most notable of these Bachs are:\r\n\r\n   1. Johann Christoph Bach, Court and Town Organist at Eisenach.(28) He\r\n      was particularly happy in his beautiful melodies and in setting\r\n      words to music. In the _Archives of the Bachs,_(29) which was in\r\n      Carl Philipp Emmanuel’s possession at Hamburg, there is a Motet by\r\n      Johann Christoph in which he boldly uses the augmented sixth, a\r\n      proceeding considered extremely daring in his day.(30) He was also\r\n      an uncommon master of harmony, as may be inferred from a Cantata\r\n      composed by him for Michaelmas, to the words “Es erhub sich ein\r\n      Streit,” etc., which has twenty-two obbligato parts in correct\r\n      harmony.(31) Yet another proof of his rare skill is in the alleged\r\n      fact that he never played the Organ or Clavier in less than five\r\n      parts.(32) Carl Philipp Emmanuel had a particularly warm regard for\r\n      him.(33) I remember the old man playing some of his compositions to\r\n      me on the Clavier at Hamburg, and how quizzically he looked at me\r\n      when one of these daring passages occurred.(34)\r\n   2. Johann Michael Bach, Organist and Town Clerk at Gehren.(35) He was\r\n      the younger brother of Johann Christoph, and like him, a\r\n      particularly good composer.  The Archives already mentioned(36)\r\n      contain several of his Motets, including one for eight voices in\r\n      double chorus,(37) and many compositions for Church use.\r\n   3. Johann Bernhard Bach, Musician in the Prince’s Kapelle and Organist\r\n      at Eisenach.(38)He is said to have composed remarkably fine Suites,\r\n      or Overtures, in the French style.(39)\r\n\r\nBesides these three men, the Bachs boasted several able composers in the\r\ngenerations preceding Johann Sebastian,(40) men who undoubtedly would have\r\nobtained higher positions, wider reputation, and more brilliant fortune if\r\nthey could have torn themselves from their native Thuringia to display\r\ntheir gifts elsewhere in Germany or abroad. But none of the Bachs seems to\r\nhave felt an inclination to migrate. Modest in their needs, frugal by\r\nnature and training, they were content with little, engrossed in and\r\nsatisfied by their art, and wholly indifferent to the decorations which\r\ngreat men of that time were wont to bestow on artists as special marks of\r\nhonour. The fact that others who appreciated them were thus distinguished\r\ndid not rouse the slightest envy in the Bachs.\r\n\r\nThe Bachs not only displayed a happy contentedness, indispensable for the\r\ncheery enjoyment of life, but exhibited a clannish attachment to each\r\nother.  They could not all live in the same locality.  But it was their\r\nhabit to meet once a year at a time and place arranged beforehand.  These\r\ngatherings generally took place at Erfurt, Eisenach, and sometimes at\r\nArnstadt.  Even after the family had grown very large, and many of its\r\nmembers had left Thuringia to settle in Upper and Lower Saxony and\r\nFranconia, the Bachs continued their annual meetings.  On these occasions\r\nmusic was their sole recreation.  As those present were either Cantors,\r\nOrganists, or Town Musicians, employed in the service of the Church and\r\naccustomed to preface the day’s work with prayer, their first act was to\r\nsing a Hymn.  Having fulfilled their religious duty, they spent the rest\r\nof the time in frivolous recreations.  Best of all they liked to\r\nextemporise a chorus out of popular songs, comic or jocular, weaving them\r\ninto a harmonious whole while declaiming the words of each. They called\r\nthis hotch-potch a “Quodlibet,” laughed uproariously at it, and roused\r\nequally hearty and irrepressible laughter in their audience.(41) It is\r\nsuggested that German Comic Opera has its origin in these trifles.  But\r\nthe “Quodlibet” was a familiar institution in Germany at a much earlier\r\nperiod.  I possess a collection of them printed and published at Vienna in\r\n1542.(42)\r\n\r\nBut these light-hearted Thuringians, and even those of their family who\r\ntreated their art more seriously and worthily, would not have escaped\r\noblivion had there not emerged in the fulness of time one whose genius and\r\nrenown reflected their splendour and brilliancy on his forbears.  This\r\nman, the glory of his family, pride of his countrymen, most gifted\r\nfavourite of the Muse of Music, was Johann Sebastian Bach.\r\n\r\n                        [Bach’s Home at Eisenach]\r\n\r\n                         Bach’s Home at Eisenach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE CAREER OF BACH\r\n\r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian Bach was born on March 21, 1685,(43) at Eisenach, where\r\nhis father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, was Court and Town Musician.(44) Johann\r\nAmbrosius had a twin brother, Johann Christoph, Musician to the Court and\r\nTown of Arnstadt,(45) who so exactly resembled him that even their wives\r\ncould distinguish them only by their dress.  The twins appear to have been\r\nquite remarkable.  They were deeply attached, alike in disposition, in\r\nvoice, and in the style of their music.  If one was ill, so was the other.\r\nThey died within a short time of each other, and were objects of wondering\r\ninterest to all who knew them.(46)\r\n\r\nIn 1695, when Johann Sebastian was not quite ten years old, his father\r\ndied. He lost his mother at an earlier period.(47) So, being left an\r\norphan, he became dependent on his eldest brother, Johann Christoph,\r\nOrganist at Ohrdruf,(48) from whom he received his earliest lessons on the\r\nClavier.(49) His inclination and talent for music must already have been\r\npronounced.  For his brother no sooner had given him one piece to learn\r\nthan the boy was demanding another more difficult.  The most renowned\r\nClavier composers of that day were Froberger,(50) Fischer,(51) Johann\r\nCaspar Kerl,(52) Pachelbel,(53) Buxtehude,(54) Bruhns,(55) and Böhm.(56)\r\nJohann Christoph possessed a book containing several pieces by these\r\nmasters, and Bach begged earnestly for it, but without effect.  Refusal\r\nincreasing his determination, he laid his plans to get the book without\r\nhis brother’s knowledge.  It was kept on a book-shelf which had a latticed\r\nfront.  Bach’s hands were small.  Inserting them, he got hold of the book,\r\nrolled it up, and drew it out.  As he was not allowed a candle, he could\r\nonly copy it on moonlight nights, and it was six months before he finished\r\nhis heavy task.  As soon as it was completed he looked forward to using in\r\nsecret a treasure won by so much labour.  But his brother found the copy\r\nand took it from him without pity, nor did Bach recover it until his\r\nbrother’s death soon after.(57)\r\n\r\nBeing once more left destitute,(58) Johann Sebastian set out for Lüneburg\r\nwith one of his Ohrdruf schoolfellows, named Erdmann(59) (afterwards\r\nRussian Resident at Danzig), and entered the choir of St. Michael’s\r\nConvent.  His fine treble voice procured him a fair livelihood. But\r\nunfortunately he soon lost it and did not at once develop another. (60)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his ambition to play the Organ and Clavier remained as keen as\r\never, and impelled him to hear and practise everything that promised him\r\nimprovement.  For that purpose, while he was at Lüeburg, he several times\r\ntravelled to Hamburg to hear the famous organist,(61) Johann Adam\r\nReinken.(62) Often, too, he walked to Celle to hear the Duke’s French band\r\nplay French music, which was a novelty in those parts.(63)\r\n\r\nThe date and circumstances of his removal from Lüneburg to Weimar are not\r\nprecisely known.(64) He certainly became Court Musician there in 1703,\r\nwhen he was just over eighteen years of age.(65) But in the following year\r\nhe gave up the post on his appointment as Organist to the new Church at\r\nArnstadt, probably desiring to develop his taste for the Organ and\r\nrealising that he would have better opportunities to do so at Arnstadt\r\nthan at Weimar, where he was engaged simply to play the Violin.(66) At\r\nArnstadt he set himself assiduously to study the works of the celebrated\r\norganists of the period, so far as his modest means permitted him, and in\r\norder to improve himself in composition(67) and Organ playing,(68) walked\r\nthe whole way to Lübeck to hear Dietrich Buxtehude, Organist of St. Mary’s\r\nChurch in that city, with whose compositions he was acquainted already. He\r\nremained there about three months,(69) listening to the celebrated\r\nOrganist, but without making himself known to him, and returned to\r\nArnstadt with his experience much increased.\r\n\r\nBach’s zeal and persevering diligence had already drawn attention to him,\r\nas is evident from the fact that he received in succession several offers\r\nof vacant organistships, one of which, at the Church of St. Blasius,\r\nMühlhausen, he accepted in 1707.(70) Barely a year after he entered upon\r\nhis duties there(71) he again visited Weimar and played to the Duke, who\r\nwas so pleased with his performance that he offered him the post of Court\r\nOrganist, which he accepted.(72) Weimar promised him a particularly\r\nagreeable atmosphere in which to cultivate his genius.(73) He applied\r\nhimself closely to his work, and probably at this period achieved the\r\nmastery of the Organ that he ever afterwards possessed.  At Weimar also he\r\nwrote his great compositions for that instrument.(74) In 1717(75) the Duke\r\nappointed him Concertmeister, a post which gave him further opportunity to\r\ndevelop his art, since it required him to compose and direct Church music.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Zachau, Handel’s master, died at Halle, where\r\nhe was Organist.(76) Bach, who by now had acquired a great reputation, was\r\ninvited to succeed him.(77) He visited Halle and composed a work as a\r\nspecimen of his skill But for some reason unknown he did not obtain the\r\npost.  It was given to a clever pupil of Zachau, named Kirchhoff.(78)\r\n\r\nJohann Sebastian was now thirty-two years old. He had made good use of his\r\nopportunities, had studied hard as a player and composer, and by tireless\r\nenthusiasm had so completely mastered every branch of his art, that he\r\ntowered like a giant above his contemporaries. Both amateurs and\r\nprofessional musicians already regarded him with admiration when, in 1717,\r\nMarchand, the French virtuoso, a celebrated Clavier and Organ player,\r\nvisited Dresden.  He played before the King-Elector(79) and won such\r\napprobation that he was offered a large salary to enter His Majesty’s\r\nservice.(80) Marchand’s chief merit was his finished technique.  Like\r\nCouperin,(81) his musical ideas were weak to the point of banality, as we\r\nmay judge from his compositions.(82) Bach was an equally finished player,\r\nand so rich in ideas that Marchand’s head would have swollen had he been\r\nequally gifted.  Volumier, Concertmeister at Dresden,(83) was aware of\r\nthese circumstances, and knowing that the young German had his instrument\r\nand his imagination under the fullest control, determined to arrange a\r\ncontest between the two men in order to give his sovereign the\r\nsatisfaction of judging their merits.  With the King’s approbation, a\r\nmessage was dispatched to Bach at Weimar(84) inviting him to a contest\r\nwith Marchand.  Bach accepted the invitation and set out at once on his\r\njourney.  Upon his arrival at Dresden Volumier procured him an opportunity\r\nto hear Marchand secretly.  Far from being discouraged by what he heard,\r\nBach wrote a polite note to the French artist challenging him to a trial\r\nof skill, and offering to play at sight anything Marchand put before him,\r\nprovided the Frenchman submitted himself to a similar test.  Marchand\r\naccepted the challenge, a time and place for the contest were fixed, and\r\nthe King gave his approval.  At the appointed hour a large and\r\ndistinguished company assembled in the house of Marshal Count\r\nFlemming.(85) Bach arrived punctually; Marchand did not appear.  After\r\nconsiderable delay he was sought at his lodging, when it was discovered,\r\nto the astonishment of all, that he had left Dresden that morning without\r\ntaking leave of anybody.  Bach therefore performed alone, and excited the\r\nadmiration of all who heard him, though Volumier was cheated of his\r\nintention to exhibit the inferiority of French to German art.  Bach was\r\noverwhelmed with congratulations; but the dishonesty of a Court official\r\nis said to have intercepted a present of one hundred louis d’or sent to\r\nhim by the King.(86)\r\n\r\nBach had not long returned to Weimar when Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen,\r\na good judge of music and a first-rate amateur,(87) offered him the post\r\nof Kapellmeister.  He entered at once upon his new office(88) and held it\r\nfor about six years.(89) At this period, about 1722,(90) he visited\r\nHamburg, played the Organ there, and excited general admiration.  The\r\nveteran Reinken—he was nearly one hundred years old—was particularly\r\nimpressed by Bach’s performance.  After he had treated the Choral _An\r\nWasserflüssen Babylon_ for half an hour in variation after variation in\r\nthe true Organ style,(91) Reinken paid him the compliment of saying, “I\r\nthought this art was dead, but I see that it survives in you.”  Reinken\r\nhad treated the same Choral in a similar manner some years before and had\r\nhad his work engraved, showing that he thought highly of it.  His praise\r\ntherefore was particularly flattering to Bach.(92)\r\n\r\nOn the death of Kuhnau in 1723(93) Bach was appointed Director of Music\r\nand Cantor to St. Thomas’ School, Leipzig,(94) a position which he\r\noccupied until his death.  Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen had great\r\nregard for him and Bach left his service with regret.(95) But he saw the\r\nfinger of Providence in the event; for the Prince died shortly\r\nafterwards.(96) The loss of his patron affected him deeply, and moved him\r\nto compose a funeral Cantata containing remarkably fine double choruses\r\nwhich he himself conducted at Cöthen.(97) While he was at St. Thomas’ he\r\nwas appointed honorary Kapellmeister to the Duke of Weissenfels(98) and,\r\nin the following year (1736), received the title of Court Composer to the\r\nKing-Elector of Poland-Saxony.(99) The two compliments are not of great\r\nconsequence, and the second was to some degree corollary to Bach’s\r\nposition as Cantor of St. Thomas’ School.(100)\r\n\r\nCarl Philipp Emmanuel, Bach’s second son, entered the service of Frederick\r\nthe Great of Prussia in 1740.  So widely was Bach’s skill recognised by\r\nthis time that the King, who often heard him praised, was curious to meet\r\nso great an artist.  More than once he hinted to Carl Philipp Emmanuel\r\nthat it would be agreeable to welcome his father to Potsdam, and as Bach\r\ndid not appear, desired to know the reason.  Carl Philipp did not fail to\r\nacquaint his father with the King’s interest.  But for some time Bach was\r\ntoo occupied with his duties to accede to the invitation.  However, as\r\nCarl Philipp continued to urge him, he set out for Potsdam towards the end\r\nof 1747, in company with his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann.(101) It was\r\nthe King’s custom to hold a private concert every evening, and to take\r\npart on the flute in a Concerto or two. One evening,(102) when he had got\r\nout his flute and the musicians were at their desks, an official brought\r\nhim a list of the strangers newly arrived at Potsdam.  Flute in hand the\r\nKing ran through the names, and suddenly turning to the waiting musicians,\r\nsaid with considerable excitement, “Gentlemen, Old Bach has arrived.”  The\r\nflute was put away for the evening, and Bach, who had alighted at his\r\nson’s lodging, was summoned immediately to the Palace.  Wilhelm\r\nFriedemann, who accompanied his father, often told me the story.  Nor am I\r\nlikely to forget the racy manner in which he related it.  The courtesy of\r\nthose days demanded rather prolix compliments, and the first introduction\r\nof Bach to so illustrious a monarch, into whose presence he had hurried\r\nwithout being allowed time to change his travelling dress for a Cantor’s\r\nblack gown, obviously invited ceremonial speeches on both sides.  I will\r\nnot dwell on them; Wilhelm Friedemann related a lengthy and formal\r\nconversation between the King and the Cantor.(103)\r\n\r\nMore worthy of record is the fact that the King gave up his concert for\r\nthat evening and invited Bach, already known as “Old Bach,” to try the\r\nSilbermann pianofortes(104) which stood in various parts of the\r\nPalace.(105) Accompanied from room to room by the King and the musicians,\r\nBach tried the instruments and improvised upon them before his illustrious\r\ncompanion.  After some time he asked the King to give him a subject for a\r\nFugue, that he might treat it extempore.  The King did so, and expressed\r\nhis astonishment at Bach’s profound skill in developing it.  Anxious to\r\nsee to what lengths the art could be carried, the King desired Bach to\r\nimprovise a six-part Fugue.  But as every subject is not suitable for\r\npolyphonic treatment, Bach himself chose a theme and, to the astonishment\r\nof all who were present, developed it with the skill and distinction he\r\nhad shown in treating the King’s subject.  His Majesty expressed a wish to\r\nhear him on the Organ also. Accordingly, next day, Bach inspected all the\r\nOrgans in Potsdam,(106) as the evening before he had tried the Silbermann\r\npianofortes. On his return to Leipzig he developed the King’s theme in\r\nthree and six parts, added Canones diversi upon it, engraved the whole\r\nunder the title _Musikalisches Opfer_ and dedicated it to the royal author\r\nof the theme.(107)\r\n\r\nHis visit to Potsdam was Bach’s last journey.  The indefatigable diligence\r\nhe had shown all his life, and particularly in his younger years, when\r\nsuccessive days and nights were given to study, seriously affected his\r\neye-sight.  The weakness grew with age and became very distressing in\r\ncharacter.  On the advice of friends who placed great confidence in the\r\nskill of a London oculist lately come to Leipzig,(108) Bach submitted to\r\nan operation, which twice failed.  He lost his sight completely in\r\nconsequence, and his hitherto vigorous constitution was undermined by the\r\ndrugs administered to him.  He sank gradually for full half a year, and\r\nexpired on the evening of July 30, 1760, in the sixty-sixth year of his\r\nage.(109) Ten days before his death(110) he was suddenly able to see again\r\nand to bear the light.  A few hours later he was seized by an apoplexy and\r\ninflammatory fever, and notwithstanding all possible medical aid, his\r\nweakened frame succumbed to the attack.\r\n\r\nSuch was the career of this remarkable man.  I will only add that he was\r\ntwice married, and that he had by his first wife seven, and by his second\r\nwife thirteen children; in all, eleven sons and nine daughters.(111) All\r\nof his sons had an admirable talent for music, but only the elder ones\r\nfully developed it.(112)\r\n\r\n         [The Church and School of St. Thomas, Leipzig, in 1723.]\r\n\r\n          The Church and School of St. Thomas, Leipzig, in 1723.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IIA.(113) BACH AT LEIPZIG, 1723-1750\r\n\r\n\r\nBach was inducted into his office as Cantor of St. Thomas’ School at nine\r\no’clock on the morning of Monday, May 31, 1723.  He died in his official\r\nresidence there at a quarter to nine on the evening of Tuesday, July 28,\r\n1750.  He was buried early on the morning of Friday, July 31, in the\r\nchurchyard of St. John’s, Leipzig.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of his death, made from the pulpit of St. Thomas’ on the\r\nday of his funeral, described him as “Court Composer to His Majesty the\r\nKing of Poland and Electoral and Serene Highness of Saxony, Kapellmeister\r\nto His Highness the Prince of Anhalt-Cothen, and Cantor to St. Thomas’\r\nSchool of this town.”  Bach usually designated himself “Director Chori\r\nMusici Lipsiensis,” or shortly, “Director Musices.”  Circumstances led him\r\nto emphasise a title which asserted a musical prerogative not confined to\r\nthe School and the churches it served.\r\n\r\nThe Cantor of St. Thomas’ was charged formerly with the musical direction\r\nof four Leipzig churches: St. Thomas’, St. Nicolas’, St. Peter’s, and the\r\nNew Church.  He was also responsible for the music in the University\r\nChurch of St. Paul, the so-called “old service,” held originally on the\r\nFestivals of Easter, Whit, Christmas, and the Reformation, and once during\r\neach University quarter. On high days music also had to be provided at St.\r\nJohn’s Church.\r\n\r\nBach, as Cantor, succeeded to a more restricted responsibility, which\r\ndated from the early years of the eighteenth century.  The New Church,\r\noriginally the Church of the Franciscans, had been restored to use in\r\n1699.  In 1704 Georg Philipp Telemann, who came to Leipzig as a law\r\nstudent three years before, was appointed Organist there. He also founded\r\nthe Collegium Musicum, or University Musical Society, a farther slight\r\nupon the Cantor’s position.  Not until 1729 did the Society pass under\r\nBach’s direction and its members become available as auxiliaries in the\r\nchurch choirs under his charge.  Notwithstanding that Bach’s predecessor\r\nKuhnau had protested against Telemann’s independence, the direction of the\r\nNew Church’s music passed out of the Cantor’s control, though the School\r\ncontinued to provide the choristers.  Six years later the University\r\nChurch of St. Paul also began an independent course.  In 1710 the\r\nauthorities resolved to hold a University service in the church every\r\nSunday. Kuhnau asserted his prerogative as Cantor. But he was only able to\r\nmaintain it by offering to provide the music for the “new service” as well\r\nas for the “old service” at the fee of twelve thalers which the University\r\nso far had paid for the latter.  After his death the University appointed\r\n(April 3, 1723) Johann Gottlieb Görner, already Organist of St. Nicolas’\r\nsince 1721, to control the music both of the “old” and “new” services, for\r\nwhich the University provided the choir.  Not until after a direct appeal\r\nto the King did Bach succeed, in 1726, in compelling the University to\r\nrestore to the Cantor his emoluments in regard to the “old service,” the\r\nconduct of which had been restored to him on his appointment as Cantor.\r\nThe “new service” remained under Görner’s direction.  As to St. Peter’s,\r\nits services, which had entirely ceased, were revived in 1711. The music,\r\nhowever, was simple, and consisted only of hymns.\r\n\r\nThus Bach, as Cantor, was responsible for the music in the two principal\r\nchurches, St. Thomas’ and St. Nicolas’.  The School also provided the\r\nchoir for St. Peter’s and the New Church.  The junior and least competent\r\nsingers sang at St. Peter’s.  The rest were pretty equally distributed\r\nbetween the other three churches.  At the New Church the music was\r\nperformed under the direction of a Chorpräfect.  At St. Thomas’ and St.\r\nNicolas’ Bach personally directed the concerted music.  On ordinary\r\nSundays a Cantata or Motet was performed in each church alternately.  At\r\nthe great Festivals, New Year, Epiphany, Ascension Day, Trinity Sunday,\r\nand the Annunciation, Cantatas were sung at both churches, the two choirs\r\nsinging at Vespers in the second church the Cantata performed by them in\r\nthe morning at the other church.  On these occasions the second choir was\r\nconducted by a Chorpräfect. The principal Sunday service in both churches\r\nbegan at seven in the morning, ended at eleven, and observed the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n      1. Organ Prelude.\r\n      2. Motet, related to the Gospel for the Day; (omitted in Lent and\r\n      replaced by the Benedictus).\r\n      3. Introit.\r\n      4. Kyrie, sung alternately, in German and Latin.\r\n      5. The Lord’s Prayer, intoned at the altar.\r\n      6. Gloria, intoned at the altar and answered either by the Choir’s\r\n      Et in terra pax hominibus, or by the congregation with the Hymn,\r\n      Allein Gott in der Höh’ sei Ehr, the German version of the Gloria.\r\n      7. Collect, intoned in Latin; preceded by the preces Dominus\r\n      vobiscum and Et cum spiritu tuo.\r\n      8. Epistle.\r\n      9. Litany, in Advent and Lent only; intoned by four boys, the Choir\r\n      responding.\r\n      10. Hymn, appropriate to the Gospel.\r\n      11. Gospel.\r\n      12. Credo, intoned; (in Lent, last three Sundays of Advent, and\r\n      Festivals of Apostles, the Nicene Creed, sung in Latin).\r\n      13. Prelude, followed by a Cantata, lasting about twenty minutes; on\r\n      alternate Sundays in each church.\r\n      14. The Creed in German, Wir glauben all’ an einen Gott, sung by the\r\n      congregation.\r\n      15. Sermon, lasting one hour (8-9 A.M.).\r\n      16. Hymn, Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend, followed by the\r\n      reading of the Gospel, on which the Sermon had been based.\r\n      17. General Confession, prayers, and Lord’s Prayer.\r\n      18. Blessing.\r\n      19. Hymn.\r\n      20. Communion Service; Hymns and Organ extemporisation.\r\n      21. Benediction.\r\n\r\nVespers began at a quarter past one and was a comparatively simple\r\nservice; the music consisted of Hymns, a Motet, and the Magnificat. On the\r\nlast three Sundays in Advent and throughout Lent neither Cantatas nor\r\nMotets were sung. The Organ was silent. On the three great Festivals the\r\nappointed Hymn for the season was sung at the beginning of the principal\r\nservice, before the Organ Prelude: at Christmas, Puer natus in Bethlehem;\r\nat Easter, Heut’ triumphiret Gottes Sohn; at Whitsuntide, Spiritus Sancti\r\ngratia.  During the Communion service the Sanctus and concerted music were\r\nsung.  A festal hymn followed the Benediction.  The three great Festivals\r\nwere each observed for three consecutive days, on the first and second of\r\nwhich Cantatas were sung at both churches.  On the third day concerted\r\nmusic was sung at only one of the two churches.\r\n\r\nThe other week-day Festivals for which Cantatas were provided were the\r\nFeast of the Circumcision (New Year’s Day), Epiphany, Ascension Day,\r\nPurification of the B.V.M., Annunciation of the B.V.M., Visitation of the\r\nB.V.M., Feast of St. John Baptist (Midsummer Day), Feast of St. Michael\r\nthe Archangel. The Reformation Festival was kept on October 31, or if that\r\ndate was a Saturday or Monday, on the previous or following Sunday.\r\n\r\nOn Good Friday the Passion was performed in the two principal churches\r\nalternately. Leipzig adopted no official Hymn-book.  The compilation from\r\nwhich the Hymns were chosen by Bach was the eight-volumed Gesangbuch of\r\nPaul Wagner, published at Leipzig for Dresden use in 1697.  It contained\r\nover five thousand Hymns but no music, merely the name of the tune being\r\nstated above the Hymn.  For the most part the Hymns for special, and even\r\nfor ordinary, occasions were prescribed by custom. Otherwise the power of\r\nselection was in the hands of the Cantor, and Bach’s exercise of it caused\r\nsome friction with the clergy in 1728.\r\n\r\nThe provision and direction of the music at weddings and funerals was in\r\nthe Cantor’s hands. He arranged the choirs and the music sung at the\r\nscholars’ annual processions and perambulations of the town, which took\r\nplace at Michaelmas, New Year, and on St. Martin’s and St. Gregory’s Days.\r\n\r\nAugmenting the School’s choristers, the Town Musicians took part in the\r\nChurch services and were under the Cantor’s direction. Their numbers and\r\nefficiency were inadequate.\r\n\r\nUpon the staff of the School the Cantor ranked third after the Rector and\r\nSub-Rector, and took a share in the general instruction of the scholars.\r\nClass III. went to Bach for Latin lessons, a duty which the Council\r\neventually permitted him to fulfil by deputy.  Singing classes were held\r\nby the Cantor on three days of the week, Mondays, Tuesdays, and\r\nWednesdays, at nine and noon, and on Fridays at noon.  His instruction in\r\nsinging was given to the four upper classes only.  On Saturday afternoons\r\nthe Cantata was rehearsed. Once in four weeks the Cantor took his turn to\r\ninspect the scholars.  Like the other masters, he was required to conform\r\nto the regulations of the School House, in which he lived.  He rose at\r\nfive in summer, at six in winter, dined at ten and supped at five in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nHolidays were numerous.  A week’s vacation was given at the Easter,\r\nMichaelmas, and New Year Fairs.  At Midsummer the School had a month of\r\nhalf-holidays.  Whole holidays were given on the birthdays of the four\r\nupper masters. There were no morning lessons on Saints’ Days, on the\r\noccasion of funeral orations in the University Church, and on the\r\nquarterly Speech Days. Hence, though Bach’s office carried large\r\nresponsibility, it left him considerable leisure for composition.\r\n\r\nAs Cantor Bach had an official residence in the left wing of the School\r\nHouse.  In 1723, the Cantor’s wing was of two storeys only, dwarfed by the\r\ngreater elevation of the main edifice and under the shadow of the church.\r\nBach brought to Leipzig four children of his first marriage, and his\r\nsecond wife, Anna Magdalena, presented him with a son or daughter annually\r\nfrom 1723 to 1729.  The accommodation of the Cantor’s lodging therefore\r\nrapidly became inadequate.  In the spring of 1731 Bach found a house\r\nelsewhere while an additional storey was added to it, which provided a new\r\nmusic-room, a good-sized apartment whence a passage led to the big\r\nschoolroom in the main building.  The new wing was formally opened and\r\ndedicated on June 5, 1732, when Bach’s secular Cantata Froher Tag,\r\nverlangte Stunden was performed; the libretto being by his colleague\r\nWinkler.  From thenceforward till his death eighteen years later Bach’s\r\noccupancy was not disturbed.  The wing continued to be the official\r\nresidence of the Cantor until the School moved to the suburbs of the city\r\nin 1877.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his residence, which he occupied rent free, the Cantor\r\nenjoyed a revenue from various and fluctuating sources, amounting in gross\r\nto 700 thalers (=£106 per annum).  His fixed stipend was only 100 thalers\r\n(=£15).  About 12 thalers came to him from endowments.  In kind he was\r\nentitled to 16 bushels of corn and 2 cords of firelogs, together with 2\r\nmeasures of wine at each of the three great Festivals.  From the\r\nUniversity, after his successful protest, he received 12 thalers for\r\ndirecting the “old service.” By far the larger part of Bach’s income was\r\nderived from fluctuating sources.  They were of three kinds: (1) School\r\nmonies, (2) funeral fees, (3) wedding fees.  The School monies represented\r\nperquisites derived from funds obtained by the scholars, partly by their\r\nweekly collections from the public, partly from the four annual\r\nprocessions or perambulations of the city.  From the weekly collections a\r\nsum of six pfennigs multiplied by the number of the scholars was put aside\r\nfor the four upper masters, among whom the Cantor ranked third.  From the\r\nmoney collected at the New Year, Michaelmas, and St. Martin’s Day\r\nprocessions the Rector took a thaler, the Cantor and the Sub-Rector each\r\ntook one-eleventh of the balance, sixteen thirty-thirds went to the\r\nsingers, and one-quarter of what remained fell to the Cantor.  Out of the\r\nmoney collected on St. Gregory’s Day (March 12) the Rector took one-tenth\r\nfor the entertainment of the four upper masters, and the Cantor took\r\none-third of the residue.  For funerals one thaler 15 groschen was paid\r\nwhen the whole school accompanied the procession and a Motet was sung at\r\nthe house of the deceased.  When no Motet was sung the Cantor’s fee was 15\r\ngroschen. For weddings he received two thalers.\r\n\r\nReckoned in modern currency, and judged by the standard of the period, the\r\nCantor’s income was not inadequate and served to maintain Bach’s large\r\nfamily in comfort.  When he died in 1750, in addition to a mining share\r\nvalued at 60 thalers, he possessed in cash or bonds about 360 thalers,\r\nsilver plate valued at 251 thalers, instruments valued at 371 thalers,\r\nhouse furniture valued at 29 thalers, and books valued at 38 thalers.  His\r\nwhole estate was declared at 1158 thalers, or somewhat less than the\r\nsavings of two years’ income.  But for the inequitable distribution of his\r\nproperty, owing to his intestacy, which left Anna Magdalena only about 400\r\nthalers and the mining share, Bach’s widow and unmarried daughters ought\r\nnot to have been afflicted with excessive poverty, as in fact they were.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his Cantorate Bach worked amid discouraging and\r\nunsatisfactory conditions. The Rector, Johann Heinrich Ernesti, was over\r\nseventy years of age in 1723.  The School was badly managed, its\r\ndiscipline was relaxed, the better-to-do citizens withheld their sons from\r\nit, and its numbers were seriously diminished.  In 1717 the junior classes\r\ncontained only 53 as against 120 in Ernesti’s earlier years.  The\r\nproximity and operatic traditions of Dresden and Weissenfels also had a\r\nbad effect; the St. Thomas’ boys, after attaining musical proficiency,\r\nwere apt to become restless, demanding release from their indentures, and\r\neven running away to more attractive and lucrative occupations.  Moreover,\r\nthe governors of the School were the Town Council, a body which had little\r\nsympathy with or appreciation of Bach’s artistic aims and temperament. To\r\nthese difficulties must be added another.  The Town Musicians, on whom\r\nBach relied for the nucleus of his orchestra, were few in number and\r\ninefficient.\r\n\r\nSo long as Ernesti lived, there was little prospect of reform.  But, after\r\nhis death, in October 1729, Bach made vigorous representations to the Town\r\nCouncil.  Already he had remonstrated with the Council for presenting to\r\nfoundation scholarships boys who lacked musical aptitude.  The Council\r\nretaliated by accusing Bach of neglecting his singing classes, absenting\r\nhimself without leave, and of other irregularities.  He was declared to be\r\n“incorrigible” and it was resolved (August 2, 1730) to sequestrate the\r\nCantor’s income, in other words, to withhold from him the perquisites to\r\nwhich he was entitled for the conduct of the Church services.(114)\r\n\r\nBach was not deterred from offering, three weeks later (August 23, 1730),\r\na “sketch of what constitutes well-appointed Church music, with a few\r\nimpartial reflections on its present state of decay” in Leipzig.  The\r\ndocument reveals the conditions amid which Bach worked.  Its\r\nrepresentations may be summarised:\r\n\r\nThe foundation scholars of St. Thomas’ are of four classes: Trebles,\r\nAltos, Tenors, Basses.\r\n\r\nA choir needs from four to eight “concertists” ( solo singers) and at\r\nleast two “ripienists” to each chorus part, i.e. a minimum of twelve\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\nThe foundation scholars number fifty-five, by whom the choirs of the four\r\nChurches, St. Thomas’, St. Nicolas’, St. Peter’s, and the New Church are\r\nprovided.  For the instrumental accompaniments at least twenty players are\r\nrequired: viz., 2 or 3 first Violins, 2 or 3 second Violins, 4 Violas, 2\r\nVioloncelli, 1 Contrabasso, 2 or more Flutes, 2 or 3 Oboi, 1 or 2 Fagotti,\r\n3 Trombe, 1 Timpani.  To fill these places there are eight Town Musicians,\r\nand at the moment there are no players available for third Tromba,\r\nTimpani, Viola, Violoncello, Contrabasso, third Oboe (or Taille).\r\n\r\nTo augment the Town Musicians the Cantor has been wont in the past to\r\nemploy University students and instrumental players in the School. Upon\r\nthe former “at all times” he relies for Viola, Violoncello, and\r\nContrabasso, and “generally” for the second Violins.  But the Council, by\r\nits recent resolution, no longer affords the Cantor the means to employ\r\nthem.  To place the scholars in the orchestra weakens the choir, to which\r\nthey naturally belong.\r\n\r\nBy presenting to foundation scholarships boys unskilled and ignorant of\r\nmusic, the resources at the Cantor’s disposal are still farther lessened.\r\n\r\nHence, Bach concludes, “in ceasing to receive my perquisites I am deprived\r\nof the power of putting the music into a better condition.”\r\n\r\nNo answer was made to Bach’s memorial, and he contemplated resigning his\r\nposition.  But with the advent of Johann Matthias Gesner as Rector in\r\nSeptember 1730 a happier period dawned upon the “incorrigible” Cantor.  In\r\n1732 Gesner procured the withdrawal of the Council’s ban on Bach’s\r\nperquisites.  The fallen fortunes of the School revived, and Bach did not\r\nagain make an effort to leave Leipzig.  In 1736 the grant of the post of\r\nHof-Componist to the Saxon Court gave him at length a title which\r\ncompelled the deference of his civic masters.\r\n\r\nBach’s early misunderstanding with the University cut him off from\r\nassociation with the most dignified, if not the most important,\r\ninstitution in Leipzig, and deprived him of opportunity to display his\r\ngenius beyond the radius of his Church duties.  The situation changed in\r\n1729, when he became director of the University Society, and he held the\r\npost for about ten years.  The Society gave weekly concerts on Fridays,\r\nfrom 8 to 10, and an extra concert, during the Fair season, on Thursdays\r\nat the same hour.  It performed vocal and instrumental music and was the\r\nmedium through which Bach presented his secular Cantatas, Clavier and\r\nViolin Concertos, and Orchestral Suites to the public.  The proficiency of\r\nhis elder sons and pupils, and his wife’s talent as a singer, were a\r\nfarther source of strength to the Society, whose direction undoubtedly\r\nmade these years the happiest in Bach’s life.  He took his rightful place\r\nin the musical life of the city, and relegated to a position of\r\ninferiority the smaller fry, such as Görner, who had presumed on Bach’s\r\naloofness from the University and Municipality to insinuate themselves.\r\nHis increasing reputation as an organist, gained in his annual autumn\r\ntours, also enlightened his fellow-townsmen regarding the superlative\r\nworth of one whom at the outset they were disposed to treat as a\r\nsubordinate official.\r\n\r\nThe Leipzig of Bach’s day offered various opportunities for musical\r\ncelebration; official events in the University, “gratulations” or\r\n“ovations” of favourite professors by their students, as well as patriotic\r\noccasions in which town and gown participated. The recognised fee for\r\npiecès d’occasion of a public character was fifty thalers.  Bach’s\r\nconductorship of the University Society enabled him to perform festival\r\nworks with the resources they required, and to augment the band and chorus\r\nneeded for their adequate performance.\r\n\r\nEven before he undertook the direction of the University Society, Bach\r\nmore than once provided the music for University celebrations.  On August\r\n3, 1725, his secular Cantata, _Der zufried-engestellte Aeolus,_ was\r\nperformed at the students’ celebration of Doctor August Friedrich Müller’s\r\nname-day.  In 1726 he revived an old Cantata(115) to celebrate the\r\nbirthday of another of the Leipzig teachers.  In the same year the\r\nappointment of Dr. Gottlieb Kortte as Professor of Roman Law was\r\ncelebrated by Bach’s Cantata _Vereinigte Zwietracht der wechselnden\r\nSaiten._ In 1733 the birthday of another Professor was marked by the\r\nperformance of the Cöthen Cantata to yet another text (_Die Freude reget\r\nsich_). On November 21, 1734, the lost Cantata _Thomana sass annoch\r\nbetrübt_ was sung at the induction of Gesner’s successor, Johann August\r\nErnesti, as Rector of St. Thomas’ School.\r\n\r\nBut Bach’s activity as a secular composer at Leipzig was chiefly expended\r\non patriotic celebrations. His compositions of this character are\r\nparticularly numerous during the years 1733-36, while he was seeking from\r\nthe Dresden Court the post of Hof-Componist.  The first of these\r\ncelebrations took place on May 12, 1727, the birthday of Augustus II. of\r\nPoland-Saxony, when Bach’s Cantata, _Entfernet euch, ihr heitern Sterne,_\r\nwas performed in the Market Place by the University Society.  The King was\r\npresent and listened to the performance from a convenient window.  The\r\nmusic is lost.  Six years elapsed before Bach was invited to collaborate\r\nin another celebration of the royal House.  On September 5, 1733, less\r\nthan two months after his application for the post of Hof-Componist, the\r\nUniversity Society celebrated the eleventh birthday of the Electoral\r\nPrince by performing Bach’s dramma per musica, _Die Wahl des Herkules,_ or\r\n_Herkules auf dem Scheidewege._ Barely three months later, on December 8,\r\n1733, Bach produced another Cantata in honour of the royal family, _Tönet,\r\nihr Pauken, erschallet Trompeten,_ of which he was both author and\r\ncomposer.  On no less than three occasions in 1734 Bach did homage to his\r\nunheeding sovereign.  In January the University Society, under Bach’s\r\ndirection, performed his Cantata _Blast Larmen, ihr Feinde_ to celebrate\r\nthe coronation of Augustus III.  The music had already done duty in Dr.\r\nMüller’s honour in 1725.  On the following October 5, 1734, when the King\r\nvisited Leipzig, Bach’s hurriedly written Cantata, _Preise dein Glücke,\r\ngesegnetes Sachsen,_ whose first chorus became the Osanna of the B minor\r\nMass, was performed in the Market Place.  Two days later, on October 7,\r\n1734, the King’s birthday was celebrated by another Bach Cantata,\r\n_Schleicht spielende Wellen,_ performed by the Collegium Musicum. In 1738,\r\nhaving received the coveted title of Hof-Componist in the interval (1736),\r\nBach performed a work—_Willkommen, ihr herrschenden Götter der Erden_—now\r\nlost, in honour of the marriage of the Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony to\r\nCharles of Sicily, afterwards Charles III. of Spain.\r\n\r\nApart from his musical activities and the house in which he lived there is\r\nlittle that permits us to picture Bach’s life at Leipzig.  Association\r\nwith his friends Johann Christian Hoffmann, Musical Instrument Maker to\r\nthe Court, Marianne von Ziegler, J. C. Gottsched and his musical wife,\r\nJohann Abraham Birnbaum, among the Professoriate, Picander and Christian\r\nWeiss, Bach’s regular librettists, suggests the amenities of an academic\r\nand literary circle. But the claims of his art and the care of his large\r\nfamily had the first call upon Bach’s interest.  And few men had a happier\r\nhome life.  While his elder sons were at home the family concerts were\r\namong his most agreeable experiences.  As his fame increased, his house\r\nbecame the resort of many seeking to know and hear the famous organist.\r\nLate in the thirties he resigned his directorship of the University\r\nSociety.  His sons were already off his hands and out of his house, and he\r\nturned again to the Organ works of his Weimar period.  Their revision\r\noccupied the last decade of his life, and the hitherto constant flow of\r\nChurch Cantatas ceased. Pupils resorted to him and filled his empty house,\r\nto one of whom, Altnikol, he gave a daughter in marriage.\r\n\r\nA man of rigid uprightness, sincerely religious; steeped in his art,\r\nearnest and grave, yet not lacking naive humour; ever hospitable and\r\ngenerous, and yet shrewd and cautious; pugnacious when his art was\r\nslighted or his rights were infringed; generous in the extreme to his wife\r\nand children, and eager to give the latter advantages which he had never\r\nknown himself; a lover of sound theology, and of a piety as deep as it was\r\nunpretentious—such were the qualities of one who towers above all other\r\nmasters of music in moral grandeur.\r\n\r\nFour, perhaps only three, contemporary portraits of Bach are known.  One\r\nis in the possession of the firm of Peters at Leipzig and once belonged to\r\nCarl Philipp Emmanuel’s daughter, who with inherited impiety sold it to a\r\nLeipzig flute player.  The second hung in St. Thomas’ School and is\r\nreproduced at p. 48 of this volume.  It was painted in 1746 and restored\r\nin 1913.  Both portraits are by Elias Gottlieb Haussmann, Court Painter at\r\nDresden. The third portrait belonged to Bach’s last pupil, Kittel, and\r\nused to hang on the Organ at Erfurt, whence it disappeared after 1809,\r\nduring the Napoleonic wars.  Recently Professor Fritz Volbach of Mainz has\r\ndiscovered a fourth portrait, which is printed at p. 92 of the present\r\nvolume. He supposes it to be none other than the Erfurt portrait, as\r\nindeed it well may be, since it represents a man of some sixty years,\r\naustere in countenance, but of a dignity that is not so apparent in\r\nHaussmann’s portraiture.(116)\r\n\r\nBach left no will.  In consequence his widow, Anna Magdalena, burdened\r\nwith the charge of a step-daughter and two daughters, was entitled to only\r\none-third of her husband’s estate.  Neither Carl Philipp Emmanuel nor\r\nWilhelm Friedemann was her own child.  But the fact cannot excuse gross\r\nneglect of their father’s widow. Her own sons were in a position to make\r\nsuch a contribution to her income as would at least have kept want from\r\nher door.  In fact she was permitted to become dependent on public\r\ncharity, and died, an alms-woman, on February 27, 1760, nearly ten years\r\nafter her great husband.  The three daughters survived her.  One died in\r\n1774, the second in 1781.  The third, Regine Susanna, survived them, her\r\nwant relieved by gifts from a public that at last was awakening to the\r\ngrandeur of her father.  Beethoven contributed generously.  Regine Susanna\r\ndied in December 1809, the last of Bach’s children.  In 1845 her nephew,\r\nJohann Christoph Friedrich’s son, also died.  With him the line of Johann\r\nSebastian Bach expired.\r\n\r\n   [Johann Sebastian Bach, circa 1746.

BACH AS A CLAVIER PLAYER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a Clavier player Bach was admired by all who had the good fortune to\r\nhear him and was the envy of the virtuosi of his day.  His method greatly\r\ndiffered from that of his contemporaries and predecessors, but so far no\r\none has attempted to explain in what the difference consisted. The same\r\npiece of music played by ten different performers equally intelligent and\r\ncompetent will produce a different effect in each case.  Each player will\r\nemphasise this or that detail.  This or that note will stand out with\r\ndiffering emphasis, and the general effect will vary consequently.  And\r\nyet, if all the players are equally competent, ought not their\r\nperformances to be uniform?  The fact that they are not so is due to\r\ndifference of touch, a quality which to the Clavier stands as enunciation\r\nto human speech.  Distinctness is essential for the enunciation of vowels\r\nand consonants, and not less so for the articulation of a musical phrase.\r\nBut there are gradations of distinctness.  If a sound is emitted\r\nindistinctly it is comprehensible only with effort, which occasions us to\r\nlose much of the pleasure we should otherwise experience. On the other\r\nhand, over-emphasis of words or notes is to be avoided.  Otherwise the\r\nhearer’s attention will be diverted from the tout ensemble. To permit the\r\ngeneral effect to be appreciated every note and every vowel must be\r\nsounded with balanced distinctness.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered why Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach’s _Essay on the Right\r\nManner of playing the Clavier_(117) does not elucidate the qualities that\r\nconstitute a good touch.  For he possessed in high degree the technique\r\nthat made his father pre-eminent as a player.  True, in his chapter on\r\n“Style in Performance,” he writes, “Some persons play as if their fingers\r\nwere glued together; their touch is so deliberate, and they keep the keys\r\ndown too long; while others, attempting to avoid this defect, play too\r\ncrisply, as if the keys burnt their fingers.  The right method lies\r\nbetween the two extremes.” But it would have been more useful had he told\r\nus how to reach this middle path.  As he has not done so, I must try to\r\nmake the matter as clear as is possible in words.\r\n\r\nBach placed his hand on the finger-board so that his fingers were bent and\r\ntheir extremities poised perpendicularly over the keys in a plane parallel\r\nto them.(118) Consequently none of his fingers was remote from the note it\r\nwas intended to strike, and was ready instantly to execute every command.\r\nObserve the consequences of this position.  First of all, the fingers\r\ncannot _fall_ or (as so often happens) be _thrown_ upon the notes, but are\r\n_placed_ upon them in full control of the force they may be called on to\r\nexert.  In the second place, since the force communicated to the note\r\nneeds to be maintained with uniform pressure, the finger should not be\r\nreleased perpendicularly from the key, but can be withdrawn gently and\r\ngradually towards the palm of the hand.  In the third place, when passing\r\nfrom one note to another, a sliding action instinctively instructs the\r\nnext finger regarding the amount of force exerted by its predecessor, so\r\nthat the tone is equally regulated and the notes are equally distinct.  In\r\nother words, the touch is neither too long nor too short, as Carl Philipp\r\nEmmanuel complains, but is just what it ought to be.(119) Many advantages\r\narise from holding the hand in Bach’s position and from adopting his\r\ntouch, on the Clavichord and Harpsichord,(120) and on  the Organ as well.\r\nI point out merely the most important of them.   To begin with, if the\r\nfingers are bent, their movements are free.  The notes are struck without\r\neffort and with less risk of missing or hitting too hard, a frequent fault\r\nwith people who play with their fingers elongated or insufficiently bent.\r\nIn the second place, the sliding finger-tip, and the consequently rapid\r\ntransmission of regulated force from one finger to another, tend to bring\r\nout each note clearly and to make every passage sound uniformly brilliant\r\nand distinct to the hearer without exertion.  In the third place, stroking\r\nthe note with uniform pressure permits the string to vibrate freely,\r\nimproves and prolongs the tone, and though the Clavichord is poor in\r\nquality, allows the player to sustain long notes upon it.  And the method\r\nhas this advantage: it prevents over-expenditure of strength and excessive\r\nmovement of the hand. We gather that the action of Bach’s fingers was so\r\nslight as to be barely perceptible.  Only the top joint seemed to move.\r\nHis hand preserved its rounded shape even in the most intricate passages.\r\nHis fingers rested closely upon the keys, very much in the position\r\nrequired for a “shake.”  An unemployed finger remained in a position of\r\nrepose.  It is hardly necessary to say that that other limbs of his body\r\ntook no part in his performance, as is the case with many whose hands lack\r\nthe requisite agility.(121)\r\n\r\nA man may possess all these qualities, however, and remain an indifferent\r\nperformer on the Clavier, just as clear and agreeable enunciation does not\r\nnecessarily make a good speaker.  To be a first-rate performer many other\r\nqualities are needed, and Bach possessed them all in a notable degree.\r\n\r\nSome fingers are longer and stronger than others. Hence players are\r\nfrequently seduced to use the stronger whenever they can readily do so.\r\nConsequently successive notes become unequal in tone, and passages which\r\nleave no choice as to the finger to be used may become impossible to play.\r\nBach recognised this fact very early in his career.  To get over the\r\ndifficulty he invented exercises for his own use in which the fingers of\r\nboth hands were made to practise passages in every conceivable position.\r\nBy this means every finger on both hands equally became strong and\r\nserviceable, so that he could play a rapid succession of chords, single\r\nand double “shakes,” and running passages with the utmost finish and\r\ndelicacy, and was equally fluent in passages where some fingers play a\r\n“shake” while the others on the same hand continue the melody.\r\n\r\nBesides these improvements, Bach invented a new system of fingering.(122)\r\nBefore his time, and even in his early years, it was usual for the player\r\nto pay attention to harmony rather than counterpoint. Even so it was not\r\ncustomary to use every one of the twenty-four major and minor keys.  The\r\nClavichord was still what we term “gebunden”; that is, several keys struck\r\nthe same string, which, therefore, could not be accurately tuned.(123)\r\nConsequently it was usual to employ only those keys whose notes were tuned\r\nwith some approximation to accuracy.  Again, good players in those days\r\nhardly ever used the thumb, except when a large interval had to be\r\nstretched.  But when Bach began to melodise harmony so that his middle\r\nparts not merely filled in but had a tune of their own, when, too, he\r\nbegan to deviate from the Church modes then in general vogue in secular\r\nmusic, using the diatonic and chromatic scales indifferently, and tuning\r\nthe Clavier in all the twenty-four keys, he found himself compelled to\r\nintroduce a system of fingering better adapted to his innovations than\r\nthat in use, and in particular, to challenge the convention which\r\ncondemned the thumb to inactivity. It is held by some writers that\r\nCouperin forestalled Bach’s method of fingering, in his _L’Art de toucher\r\nle Clavecin,_ published in 1716.  But that is not the case.  In the first\r\nplace, Bach was above thirty years old in 1716, and had already developed\r\na distinctive method of his own.  And in the second place, Couperin’s\r\nsystem differs materially from Bach’s, though both made more frequent use\r\nof the thumb than was so far customary.  When I say “more frequent use” I\r\ndo so advisedly; for whereas in Bach’s system the thumb is the principal\r\nfinger—for the difficult keys, as they are called, are unplayable without\r\nit—it is not equally indispensable with Couperin, whose thematic material\r\nwas not so intricate as Bach’s, nor did he compose or play in such\r\ndifficult keys.  Consequently Couperin had not an equally urgent need to\r\nuse the thumb. We need only compare Couperin’s with Bach’s system of\r\nfingering, as Carl Philipp Emmanuel explains it,(124) to discover that\r\nBach’s permits every passage, however intricate and polyphonic, to be\r\nplayed with ease, whereas Couperin’s is hardly effective even for his own\r\ncompositions.  Bach was acquainted with Couperin’s works and highly\r\nesteemed them,(125) as he did those of other French Clavier composers, for\r\ntheir finish and brilliance. But he considered them affected in their\r\nexcessive use of ornaments, scarcely a single note being free from them.\r\nHe held them, also, superficial in matter.\r\n\r\nBach’s easy, unconstrained use of the fingers, his musical touch, the\r\nclearness and precision of every note he struck, the resourcefulness of\r\nhis fingering, his thorough training of every finger of both hands, the\r\nluxuriance of his thematic material and his original method of stating it,\r\nall contributed to give him almost unlimited power over his instrument, so\r\neasily did he surmount the difficulties of its keyboard.  Whether he\r\nimprovised or played his compositions from notes, he systematically\r\nemployed every finger of each hand, and his fingering was as uncommon as\r\nthe compositions themselves, yet so accurate that he never missed a note.\r\nMoreover, he read at sight other people’s compositions (which, to be sure,\r\nwere much easier than his own) with the utmost facility.  Indeed, he once\r\nboasted to a friend at Weimar that he could play at sight and without a\r\nmistake anything put before him.  But he was mistaken, as his friend\r\nconvinced him before the week was out.  Having invited Bach to breakfast\r\none morning, he placed on the Clavier, among other music, a piece which,\r\nat a first glance, seemed perfectly easy.  On his arrival, Bach, as was\r\nhis custom, sat down at the Clavier to play or look through the music.\r\nMeanwhile his friend was in the next room preparing breakfast.  In a short\r\ntime Bach took up the piece of music destined to change his opinion and\r\nbegan to play it.  He had not proceeded far before he came to a passage at\r\nwhich he stopped.  After a look at it he began again, only to stop at the\r\nsame place. “No,” he called out to his friend, who was laughing heartily\r\nin the next room, “the man does not exist who can play everything at\r\nsight.  It can’t be done.” With that he got up from the Clavier in some\r\nannoyance.(126)\r\n\r\nBach also could read scores with remarkable facility and play them on the\r\nClavier. He found no more difficulty in piecing together the separate\r\nparts when laid side by side before him.(127) He often did so when a\r\nfriend brought him a new Trio or Quartet for Strings and wished to hear\r\nhow it sounded.  If a Continuo part, however badly figured, was put before\r\nhim he could improvise a Trio or Quartet upon it.  Nay, when he was in the\r\nmood and at the height of his powers, he would convert a Trio into a\r\nQuartet by extemporising a fourth part.  On such occasions he used a\r\nHarpsichord with two manuals and pedal attachment.\r\n\r\nBach preferred the Clavichord to the Harpsichord, which, though\r\nsusceptible of great variety of tone, seemed to him lacking in soul.  The\r\nPianoforte was still in its infancy and too coarse.(128) Both for practice\r\nand intimate use he regarded the Clavichord as the best instrument and\r\npreferred to express on it his finest thoughts.  He held the Harpsichord,\r\nor Clavicembalo, incapable of the gradations of tone obtainable on the\r\nClavichord, an instrument which, though feeble in quality, is extremely\r\nflexible.\r\n\r\nNo one could adjust the quill plectrums of his Harpsichord to Bach’s\r\nsatisfaction; he always did it himself.  He tuned his Harpsichord and\r\nClavichord, and was so skilful in the operation that it never took him\r\nmore than a quarter of an hour.  It enabled him to play in any key he\r\npreferred, and placed the whole twenty-four of them at his disposal, so\r\nthat he could modulate into the remoter as easily and naturally as into\r\nthe more nearly related keys.  Those who heard him frequently could hardly\r\ndetect the fact that he had modulated into a distant key, so smooth were\r\nhis transitions.  In chromatic movements his modulation was as easy and\r\nsequent as in diatonic.  His _Chromatic Fantasia,_ which is now\r\npublished,(129) bears out my statement.  In his extemporisation he was\r\neven freer, more brilliant and expressive.\r\n\r\nWhen he played his own music Bach usually adopted a brisk pace.  He\r\ncontrived to introduce so much variety that every piece became a sort of\r\nconversation between its parts.  If he wished to express deep emotion he\r\ndid not strike the notes with great force, as many do, but expressed his\r\nfeeling in simple melodic and harmonic figures,(130) relying rather on the\r\ninternal resources of his art than external dynamics.  Therein he was\r\nright. True emotion is not suggested by hammering the Clavier. All that\r\nresults is that the notes cannot be heard distinctly, much less be\r\nconnected coherently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.  BACH THE ORGANIST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has been said regarding Bach’s admirable Clavier playing applies\r\ngenerally to his skill as an organist.  The Clavier and Organ have points\r\nin common, but in style and touch are as different as their respective\r\nuses.  What sounds well on the Clavier is ineffective on the Organ, and\r\nvice versa.  The most accomplished Clavier player may be, and usually is,\r\na bad organist unless he realises the differing natures of the two\r\ninstruments and the uses they serve.  I have come across only two men who\r\ncan be regarded as exceptions to this general rule—Bach and his eldest\r\nson, Wilhelm Friedemann.  Both were finished Clavier performers, but no\r\ntrace of the Clavier style was apparent when they played the Organ.\r\nMelody, harmony, and pace were carefully selected with due regard to the\r\nnature and distinctive use of each instrument.  When Wilhelm Friedemann\r\nplayed the Clavier his touch was elegant, delicate, agreeable.  When he\r\nplayed the Organ he inspired a feeling of reverent awe. On the one he was\r\ncharming.  On the other he was solemn, impressive. So also was his father,\r\nand to an even greater degree.  Wilhelm Friedemann was a mere child to him\r\nas an organist, and frankly admitted the fact.(131) The music that\r\nextraordinary man wrote for the Organ is full of dignity, awe-inspiring,\r\nsaturated with the atmosphere of devotion.  His improvisation was even\r\nmore inspired, dignified, and impressive: for then his imagination was\r\nuntrammelled by the irksomeness of expressing himself on paper.  What is\r\nthe essence of this art? Let me, though imperfectly, attempt an answer.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare Bach’s Clavier compositions with those written for the\r\nOrgan it is at once apparent that they differ essentially in melodic and\r\nharmonic structure.  Hence we conclude that a good organist must select\r\nfitting themes for his instrument, and let himself be guided by its\r\ncharacter and that of the place in which it stands and by the objects of\r\nits use.  Its great body of tone renders the Organ ill-adapted to light\r\nand jaunty music.  Its echoes must have liberty to rise and fall in the\r\ndim spaces of the church, otherwise the sound becomes confused, blurred,\r\nand unintelligible.  What is played upon it must be suited to the place\r\nand the instrument, in other words, must be congruous to a solemn and\r\nmajestic fabric.  Occasionally and exceptionally a solo stop may be used\r\nin a Trio, etc.  But the proper function of the Organ is to support church\r\nsinging and to stimulate devotional feeling.  The composer therefore must\r\nnot write music for it which is congruous to secular surroundings.  What\r\nis commonplace and trite can neither impress the hearer nor excite\r\ndevotional feeling.  It must therefore be banished from the Organ-loft.\r\nHow clearly Bach grasped that fact!  Even his secular music disdained\r\ntrivialities.  Much more so his Organ music, in which he seems to soar as\r\na spirit above this mortal planet.\r\n\r\nOf the means by which Bach attained to such an altitude as a composer for\r\nthe Organ we may notice his harmonic treatment of the old Church modes,\r\nhis use of the obbligato pedal, and his original registration.  The\r\nremoteness of the ecclesiastical modes from our twenty-four major and\r\nminor keys renders them particularly appropriate to the service of\r\nreligion.  Any one who looks at Bach’s simple four-part Hymn tunes\r\n(Choralgesänge) will at once convince himself of the fact.  But no one can\r\nrealise how the Organ sounds under a similar system of harmonic treatment\r\nunless he has heard it.  It becomes a choir of four or five parts, each in\r\nits natural compass.  Compare the following chords in divided harmony:\r\n\r\n                    [Divided Harmony, Bach treatment]\r\n\r\nwith these:\r\n\r\n                [Divided Harmony, conventional treatment]\r\n\r\nwhich is the more usual form organists employ. We realise instantly the\r\neffect when music in four or more parts is played in the same manner. Bach\r\nalways played the Organ so, adding the obbligato pedal, which few\r\norganists know how to use properly.  He employed it not only to sound the\r\nlow notes which organists usually play with the left hand, but he gave it\r\na regular part of its own, often so complicated that many organists would\r\nfind it difficult to play with their five fingers.\r\n\r\nTo these qualities must be added the exquisite art Bach displayed in\r\ncombining the stops of the Organ.  His registration frequently astonished\r\norganists and Organ builders, who ridiculed it at first, but were obliged\r\nin the end to admit its admirable results and to confess that the Organ\r\ngained in richness and sonority.(132)\r\n\r\nBach’s peculiar registration was based on his intimate knowledge of Organ\r\nbuilding and of the properties of each individual stop.  Very early in his\r\ncareer he made a point of giving to each part of the Organ the utterance\r\nbest suited to its qualities, and this led him to seek unusual\r\ncombinations of stops which otherwise would not have occurred to him.\r\nNothing escaped his notice which had the slightest bearing on his art or\r\npromised to advance it.  For instance, he made a point of observing the\r\neffect of large musical compositions in different surroundings.  The\r\npractised ear, which enabled him to detect the slightest error in music\r\neven of the fullest and richest texture, and the art and rapidity with\r\nwhich he tuned his instrument, alike attest his intuitive skill and\r\nmany-sidedness.  When he was at Berlin in 1747 he was shown the new Opera\r\nHouse.  He took in its good and bad qualities at a glance, whereas others\r\nhad done so only after experience. He was shown the large adjoining Saloon\r\nand went up into the gallery that runs round it. Merely glancing at the\r\nroof he remarked, “The architect has secured a novel effect which,\r\nprobably, neither himself nor any one else suspected.” The Saloon, in\r\nfact, is a parallelogram. If a person puts his face to the wall in one\r\ncorner of it and whispers a few words, another person at the corner\r\ndiagonally opposite can hear them distinctly, though to others between\r\nthem the words are inaudible.  The effect arises from the span of the\r\narches in the roof, as Bach saw at a glance.  These and similar\r\nobservations suggested to him striking and unusual combinations of Organ\r\nstops.\r\n\r\nBach brought the methods I have indicated to bear upon Church music, and\r\nthey help to explain his extraordinarily dignified and inspired playing,\r\nwhich was at once so appropriate and filled the listener with deep awe and\r\nadmiration.  His profound knowledge of harmony, unfailing originality,\r\nfreedom from a secular style, his complete command of the instrument, both\r\nmanuals and pedals, whence flowed a generous stream of the richest and\r\nmost abundant fancy, the infallible and swift judgment which allowed him\r\nalways to select from the treasury of his mind precisely the musical ideas\r\nbest suited to the occasion immediately before him, his intuitive grasp of\r\nevery detail, and his power to make it serve his artistic ends—in a word,\r\nhis transcendent genius brought the art of Organ playing to a degree of\r\nperfection which, till then, it had never attained and hardly will attain\r\nagain.  Quantz(133) has expressed the same opinion. “The admirable Johann\r\nSebastian Bach,” he writes, “brought the art of Organ playing to its\r\nhighest perfection.  It is to be hoped that when he dies it will not be\r\nsuffered to decline or be lost, as is to be feared from the small number\r\nof people who nowadays bestow pains upon it.”(134)\r\n\r\nStrangers often asked Bach to play to them between the hours of divine\r\nservice.  On those occasions he was wont to select and treat a theme in\r\nvarious ways, making it the subject of each extemporisation even if he\r\ncontinued playing for two hours.  As a beginning he played a Prelude and\r\nFugue on the Great Organ.  Then he developed it with solo stops in a Trio\r\nor Quartet.  A Hymn-tune followed, whose melody he interrupted in the\r\nsubtlest fashion with fragments of the theme in three or four parts.  Last\r\ncame a Fugue, with full Organ, in which he treated the subject alone or in\r\nassociation with one or more accessory themes. Here we have the art which\r\nold Reinken of Hamburg considered to be lost, but which, as he afterwards\r\nfound, not only survived but attained its greatest perfection in Bach.\r\n\r\nBach’s pre-eminent position and his high reputation often caused him to be\r\ninvited to examine candidates for vacant organistships, and to report on\r\nnew Organs.  In both cases he acted so conscientiously and impartially\r\nthat he generally made enemies.  Scheibe, late Director of Music at the\r\nDanish Court, who as a young man was examined by Bach on such an occasion,\r\nwas so incensed by Bach’s unfavourable verdict that he afterwards avenged\r\nhimself in his “Critical Musician” by violently attacking his\r\nexaminer.(135) In his examination of Organs Bach equally exposed himself\r\nto trouble.  He could as little prevail on himself to praise a bad\r\ninstrument as to recommend a bad organist.  He was, therefore, severe,\r\nthough always fair, in the tests he applied, and as he was thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the construction of the instrument it was hopeless to\r\nattempt to deceive him.  First of all he drew out all the stops, to hear\r\nthe Full Organ.  He used to say jokingly, that he wanted to find out\r\nwhether the instrument had good lungs!  Then he gave every part of it a\r\nmost searching test.  But his sense of fairness was so strong that, if he\r\nfound the work really well done, and the builder’s remuneration too small,\r\nso that he was likely to be a loser, Bach endeavoured, and often\r\nsuccessfully, to procure for him an adequate addition to the purchase\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nWhen the examination was over, especially if the instrument pleased him,\r\nBach liked to exhibit his splendid talent, both for his own pleasure and\r\nthe gratification of those who were present.  Such demonstrations of his\r\npowers invariably invited the verdict, that he was conclusively “the\r\nprince of Clavier and Organ players,” a title which Sorge, the late\r\nhighly-esteemed organist at Lobenstein,(136) once gave him in a dedicatory\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. BACH THE COMPOSER\r\n\r\n\r\nBach’s first attempts at composition, like all early efforts, were\r\nunsatisfactory.  Lacking special instruction to direct him towards his\r\ngoal, he was compelled to do what he could in his own way, like others who\r\nhave set out upon a career without a guide.  Most youthful composers let\r\ntheir fingers run riot up and down the keyboard, snatching handfuls of\r\nnotes, assaulting the instrument in wild frenzy, in hope that something\r\nmay result from it.  Such people are merely Finger Composers—in his riper\r\nyears Bach used to call them Harpsichord Knights—that is to say, their\r\nfingers tell them what to write instead of being instructed by the brain\r\nwhat to play.(137) Bach abandoned that method of composition when he\r\nobserved that brilliant flourishes lead nowhere.  He realised that musical\r\nideas need to be subordinated to a plan and that the young composer’s\r\nfirst need is a model to instruct his efforts.  Opportunely Vivaldi’s\r\nConcertos for the Violin,(138) then recently published, gave him the\r\nguidance he needed.  He had often heard them praised as admirable works of\r\nart, and conceived the happy idea of arranging them for the Clavier.(139)\r\nHence he was led to study their structure, the musical ideas on which they\r\nare built, the variety of their modulations, and other characteristics.\r\nMoreover, in adapting to the Clavier ideas and phrases originally written\r\nfor the Violin Bach was compelled to put his brain to work, and so freed\r\nhis inspiration from dependence on his fingers.  Henceforth he was able to\r\ndraw ideas out of his own storehouse, and having placed himself on the\r\nright road, needed only perseverance and hard work to succeed. And how\r\npersevering he was!  He even robbed himself of sleep to practise in the\r\nnight what he had written during the day!  But the diligence he bestowed\r\nupon his own compositions did not hinder him from studying the works of\r\nFrescobaldi,(140) Froberger, Kerl, Pachelbel, Fischer, Strungk,(141)\r\nBuxtehude, Reinken, Bruhns, Böhm, and certain French organists who were\r\nfamed in those days as masters of harmony and fugue.(142)\r\n\r\nThe models he selected—Church musicians for the most part—and his own\r\ndisposition inclined him to serious and exalted subjects.  But in that\r\nkind of music little can be accomplished with inadequate technique.\r\nBach’s first object, therefore, was to develop his power of expressing\r\nhimself before he attempted to realise the ideal that beckoned him.  Music\r\nto him was a language, and the composer a poet who, whatever the idiom he\r\naffects, must first of all have at his disposal the means of making\r\nhimself intelligible to others. But the technique of his period Bach found\r\nlimited in variety and insufficiently pliable.  Therefore he set himself\r\nat the outset to refashion the accepted harmonic system.  He did so in a\r\nmanner characteristically individual and bearing the impress of his\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nIf the language of music is merely the utterance of a melodic line, a\r\nsimple sequence of musical notes, it can justly be accused of poverty.\r\nThe addition of a Bass puts it upon a harmonic foundation and clarifies\r\nit, but defines rather than gives it added richness.  A melody so\r\naccompanied—even though all the notes are not those of the true Bass—or\r\ntreated with simple embellishments in the upper parts, or with simple\r\nchords, used to be called “homophony.”  But it is a very different thing\r\nwhen two melodies are so interwoven that they converse together like two\r\npersons upon a footing of pleasant equality.  In the first case the\r\naccompaniment is subordinate, and serves merely to support the first or\r\nprincipal part.  In the second case the two parts are not similarly\r\nrelated.  New melodic combinations spring from their interweaving, out of\r\nwhich new forms of musical expression emerge.  If more parts are\r\ninterwoven in the same free and independent manner, the apparatus of\r\nlanguage is correspondingly enlarged, and becomes practically\r\ninexhaustible if, in addition, varieties of form and rhythm are\r\nintroduced.  Hence harmony becomes no longer a mere accompaniment of\r\nmelody, but rather a potent agency for augmenting the richness and\r\nexpressiveness of musical conversation.  To serve that end a simple\r\naccompaniment will not suffice.  True harmony is the interweaving of\r\nseveral melodies, which emerge now in the upper, now in the middle, and\r\nnow in the lower parts.\r\n\r\nFrom about the year 1720, when he was thirty-five, until his death in\r\n1750, Bach’s harmony consists in this melodic interweaving of independent\r\nmelodies, so perfect in their union that each part seems to constitute the\r\ntrue melody. Herein Bach excels all the composers in the world.(143) At\r\nleast, I have found no one to equal him in music known to me.  Even in his\r\nfour-part writing we can, not infrequently, leave out the upper and lower\r\nparts and still find the middle parts melodious and agreeable.\r\n\r\nBut in harmony of this kind each part must be highly plastic; otherwise it\r\ncannot play its role as an actual melody and at the same time combine with\r\nthe other parts.  To produce it Bach followed a course of his own, upon\r\nwhich the textbooks of his day were silent, but which his genius suggested\r\nto him.  Its originality consists in the freedom of his part writing, in\r\nwhich he transgresses, seemingly, at any rate, rules long established and\r\nto his contemporaries almost sacred. Bach, however, realised their object,\r\nwhich was simply to facilitate the flow of pure melody on a sound harmonic\r\nbasis, in other words, successive and coexistent euphony, and he succeeded\r\nwith singular success though by unfamiliar means.  Let me explain my\r\nmeaning more closely.\r\n\r\nBetween simple intervals there is little difficulty in deciding whether\r\nthe second note must rise or fall.  And in regard to phrases, or sections\r\nof a phrase, if we analyse their structure and follow out their harmonic\r\ntendency, their resolution is equally clear.  But this sense of\r\ndestination may be provoked in each part by different intervals.  As we\r\nhave observed already, every one of the four parts must flow melodically\r\nand freely.  But to secure that result it will be necessary to introduce\r\nbetween the notes which begin a phrase and establish its general\r\natmosphere other notes which often are not consonant with those employed\r\nin the other parts and whose incidence is governed by the accent.  This is\r\nwhat we call a transitus regularis et irregularis.(144) Each part starts\r\nfrom a fixed point, and returns to it, but travels freely between them.\r\nNo one has made more use of such progressions than Bach in order to colour\r\nhis parts and give them a characteristic melodic line.  Hence, unless his\r\nmusic is played with perfect fluency, occasional passages will sound\r\nharshly and we may be tempted to accuse him of exaggeration.  But the\r\ncharge is ill founded. Once we play them as Bach intended them, such\r\npassages reveal their full beauty and their attractive though bizarre\r\ndissonance opens up new vistas in the realm of sound.\r\n\r\nBut, to speak in detail of Bach’s transgression of recognised rules.  To\r\nbegin with, he admitted octaves and fifths provided they sounded well;\r\nthat is, when the cause of their being forbidden did not arise.(145)\r\nEverybody knows that there are positions in which they sound well, and\r\nothers when they should be avoided, owing to the harsh effect or thin\r\nharmony they produce.  Bach’s octaves and fifths never produce bad or thin\r\nharmony, and he was very definite as to when they could and could not be\r\nused.  In certain circumstances he would not permit hidden fifths and\r\noctaves even between the middle parts, though we exclude them only between\r\nthe outer parts.  Yet, on occasion he used them in such a barefaced manner\r\nas to puzzle the beginner in composition.  But their use very soon\r\ncommends itself.  Even in the last revision of his early compositions we\r\nfind him altering passages, which at first sight appear impeccable, with\r\nthe object of enriching their harmony and without scrupling to use hidden\r\noctaves.  A remarkable instance occurs in the first part of the\r\n_Well-tempered Clavier,_ in the E major Fugue, between the fifth and\r\nfourth bars from the end.(146) I regret to this hour that, on looking over\r\nthe later text, from which Hoffmeister and Kühnel’s edition of that work\r\nis printed,(147) I was so foolish as to reject Bach’s amended reading\r\nthere, merely because the harmony is unorthodox though more pleasing.  I\r\nstupidly preferred the older, more correct, and harsher reading, though in\r\nthe later text the three parts run easily and smoothly. And what more can\r\none demand?\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a rule that every note raised by an accidental cannot be\r\ndoubled in the chord, because the raised note must, from its nature,\r\nresolve on the note above.  If it is doubled, it must rise doubled in both\r\nparts and, consequently, form consecutive octaves.  Such is the rule.  But\r\nBach frequently doubles not only notes accidentally raised elsewhere in\r\nthe scale but actually the semitonium modi or leading-note itself.  Yet he\r\navoids consecutive octaves.  His finest works yield examples of this.\r\n\r\nAgain, Bach’s statement that “over a pedal point all intervals are\r\npermissible that occur in the three scales”(148) should be regarded rather\r\nan expansion than a violation of the recognised rule.  In general what is\r\ncalled an Organ point is merely a retarded close.  Bach, however, did not\r\nhesitate to employ it in the middle of a piece; a striking example occurs\r\nin the last Gigue of the _English Suites._(149) On a first hearing this\r\nGigue, imperfectly rendered, may not sound well.  But it grows more\r\nbeautiful as it becomes more familiar, and what seemed harsh is found to\r\nbe smooth and agreeable, until one never tires of playing and hearing it.\r\n\r\nBach’s modulation was as original and characteristic as his harmony, and\r\nas closely related to it.  But the two things, though closely associated,\r\nare not the same.  By harmony we mean the concordance of several parts; by\r\nmodulation, their progression through keys.  Modulation can take place in\r\na single part.  Harmony requires more than one.  I will endeavour to make\r\nmy meaning clearer.\r\n\r\nMost composers stick closely to their tonic key and modulate out of it\r\nwith deliberation.  In music that requires a large number of performers,\r\nand in a building, for instance a church, where the large volume of sound\r\ndies away slowly, such a habit shows good sense in the composer who wishes\r\nhis work to produce the best possible effect.  But in chamber or\r\ninstrumental music it is not always a proof of wisdom, but rather of\r\nmental poverty. Bach saw clearly that the two styles demand different\r\ntreatment.  In his large choral compositions he bridles his exuberant\r\nfancy.  In his instrumental works he lets himself go.  As he never courted\r\npopularity, but always pursued his ideal, Bach had no reason to suppress\r\nthe nobility of his inspirations, or to lower their standard for public\r\nconsumption.  Nor did he ever do so.  Therefore every modulation in his\r\ninstrumental work is a new thought, a constantly progressive creation in\r\nthe plane of the chosen keys and those related to them.  He holds fast to\r\nthe essentials of harmony, but with every modulation introduces a new\r\nsuggestion and glides so smoothly to the end of a piece that no creaking\r\nof machinery is perceptible; yet no single bar—I might almost say no part\r\nof a bar—is like another.  Every modulation bears a strict relationship to\r\nthe key from which it proceeds, and springs naturally from it.  Bach\r\nignored, or rather despised, the sudden sallies by which many composers\r\nseek to surprise their hearers.  Even in his chromatic passages his\r\nprogressions are so smooth and easy that we are hardly conscious of them,\r\nhowever extreme they may be.  He makes us feel that he has not stepped\r\noutside the diatonic scale, so quick is he to seize upon the consonances\r\ncommon to dissonant systems and combine them to his sure purpose.\r\n\r\n                      [The Bach Statue at Eisenach]\r\n\r\n                       The Bach Statue at Eisenach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. BACH THE COMPOSER (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n\r\nBach’s treatment of harmony and modulation powerfully influenced his\r\nmelody.  The strands of his harmony are really concurrent melodies. They\r\nflow easily and expressively, never engross the hearer’s attention, but\r\ndivide his interest, as now one now the other becomes prominent. Even when\r\nthey are noticeable they seem obscured by the melodic parts that accompany\r\nthem—I say “seem obscured,” for if the hearer is sufficiently instructed\r\nto distinguish the several melodies in the ensemble he will discover them\r\nto be more clearly defined by their accompaniment.\r\n\r\nThe combination of several melodic lines obliges the composer to use\r\ndevices which are unnecessary in homophonic music.  A single melody can\r\ndevelop as it pleases.  But when two or more are combined each must be so\r\ndelicately and cleverly fashioned that it can be interwoven with the\r\nothers in this direction and in that.  And here we detect one at least of\r\nthe reasons why Bach’s melodies are so strangely original, and his tunes\r\nso clearly distinguishable from those of other composers.  Provided that\r\nnovelty does not degenerate into eccentricity or extravagance, and that\r\nclearness and facility of expression march with agreeableness, a\r\ncomposer’s meritoriousness is proclaimed in his originality.(150) The one\r\ndrawback is that the ordinary hearer cannot appreciate melodic beauties\r\nwhich are patent only to the expert.\r\n\r\nBut Bach’s melodies are not invariably so handicapped. They are always\r\noriginal, it is true. But in his free compositions the melodies are so\r\nnatural and spontaneous that, while they sound differently from those of\r\nother composers, their naturalness, and the sincerity of feeling that\r\ninspires them, make them intelligible to every listener.  Most of the\r\nPreludes in the _Well-tempered Clavier_ as well as a number of movements\r\nin the Suites are of this character.\r\n\r\nBach’s melody, then, bears the unmistakable stamp of originality.  And so\r\ndoes his passage work, as it is called.  Such novelty, originality, and\r\nbrilliancy are not found in any other composer. Examples are to be found\r\nin all Bach’s Clavier works. But the most striking and original are in the\r\n_Great Variations,_(151) in the first Part of the _Clavierübung,_(152) in\r\nthe _English Suites,_(153) and the _Chromatic Fantasia._(154) In the last\r\nparticularly Bach’s fertility impresses us.  The greater part of its\r\npassage work is in the form of harmonic arpeggios whose richness and\r\noriginality match the chords they represent.\r\n\r\nIn order to realise the care and skill Bach expended on his melody and\r\nharmony, and how he put the very best of his genius into his work, I need\r\nonly instance his efforts to construct a composition incapable of being\r\nharmonised with another melodic part.  In his day it was regarded as\r\nimperative to perfect the harmonic structure of part-writing.\r\nConsequently the composer was careful to complete his chords and leave no\r\ndoor open for another part.  So far the rule had been followed more or\r\nless closely in music for two, three, and four parts, and Bach observed it\r\nin such cases.  But he applied it also to compositions consisting of a\r\nsingle part, and to a deliberate experiment in this form we owe the six\r\nViolin and the six Violoncello Solo Suites,(155) which have no\r\naccompaniment and do not require one.  So remarkable is Bach’s skill that\r\nthe solo instrument actually produces all the notes required for complete\r\nharmony, rendering a second part unnecessary and even impossible.\r\n\r\nBach’s melody never palls on us, because of the presence in it of those\r\nqualities to which I have referred.  It remains “ever fair and young,”\r\nlike Nature herself.  In his earlier works, in which we find him still in\r\nbondage to the prevailing mode, there is a good deal that to-day seems\r\nantiquated.  But when, as in his later works, he draws his melody from the\r\nliving wells of inspiration and cuts himself adrift from convention, all\r\nis as fresh and new as if it had been written yesterday.  Of how many\r\ncompositions of that period can the same be said?  Even the works of\r\ningenious composers like Reinhard Keiser(156) and Handel have become\r\nold-fashioned sooner than we or their composers might have supposed. Like\r\nother caterers for the public, they were obliged to pander to its taste,\r\nand such music endures no longer than the standard which produced it.\r\nNothing is more inconstant and fickle than popular caprice and, in\r\ngeneral, what is called fashion.  It must be admitted, however, that\r\nHandel’s Fugues are not yet out of date, though there are probably few of\r\nhis Arias that we now find agreeable.(157)\r\n\r\nBach’s melody and harmony are rendered still more distinctive by their\r\ninexhaustible rhythmic variety.  Hitherto we have discussed his music\r\nmerely subjectively as harmony and melody.  But to display vivacity and\r\nvariety music needs to be uttered with rhythmic point and vigour.  More\r\nthan those of any other period composers of Bach’s time found no\r\ndifficulty in this, for they acquired facility in the management of rhythm\r\nin the “Suite,” which held the place of our “Sonata.” Between the initial\r\nPrelude and closing Gigue the Suite includes a number of characteristic\r\nFrench dance measures, whose rhythm is their distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic.  Composers of Bach’s day, therefore, were familiar with\r\nmeasures and rhythms which are now obsolete.  Moreover skilful treatment\r\nwas necessary in order that each dance might exhibit its own distinctive\r\ncharacter and swing.  Herein Bach exceeded his predecessors and\r\ncontemporaries.  He experimented with every kind of key and rhythm in\r\norder to give variety and colour to each movement.  Out of his experience\r\nhe acquired such facility that, even in Fugue, with its complex\r\ninterweaving of several parts, he was able to employ a rhythm as easy as\r\nit was striking, as characteristic as it was sustained from beginning to\r\nend, as natural as a simple Minuet.\r\n\r\nThe source of Bach’s astonishing pre-eminence is to be sought in his\r\nfacile and constant application of the methods we have discussed.  In\r\nwhatever form he chose to express himself, easy or difficult, he was\r\nsuccessful and seemingly effortless.(158) There is not a note in his music\r\nthat does not suggest consummate ease of workmanship. What he sets out to\r\ndo he concludes triumphantly. The result is complete and perfect; no one\r\ncould wish for a single note to be other than it is.  Some illustrations\r\nwill make my point clearer.\r\n\r\nCarl Philipp Emmanuel, in the preface to his father’s _Vierstimmige\r\nChoralgesänge_ (“Four-part Hymn-tunes”), which he edited,(159) says that\r\nthe world was accustomed to look for nothing but masterpieces from Bach.\r\nSome reviewers thought this praise exaggerated.  But if the term\r\n“masterpiece” is restricted to works written during the years of Bach’s\r\nmaturity(160) it is nothing less than the truth.  Others have produced\r\nmasterpieces in various forms which may be placed honourably by the side\r\nof his.  For instance, certain Allemandes, Courantes, etc., by Handel and\r\nothers are not less beautiful, though less richly wrought, than Bach’s.\r\nBut in Fugue, Counterpoint, and Canon he stands alone, in a grandeur so\r\nisolated that all around him seems desert and void.  No one ever wrote\r\nFugues to compare with his; indeed, persons unacquainted with them cannot\r\nimagine what a Fugue is and ought to be.  The ordinary Fugue follows a\r\nrule of thumb development.  It takes a theme, puts another beside it,\r\npasses them into related keys, and writes other parts round them over a\r\nContinuo.  Certainly this is Fugue: but of what merit?  Persons who know\r\nno other not unnaturally hold the whole species in little esteem, and the\r\nplayer who hopes to make such commonplace material convincing will need\r\nall his skill and imagination.\r\n\r\nBach’s Fugue is of quite another kind.  It presents all the\r\ncharacteristics we are accustomed to in freer musical forms: a flowing and\r\ndistinctive melody, ease, clarity, and facility in the progression of the\r\nparts, inexhaustible variety of modulation, purest harmony, the exclusion\r\nof every jarring or unnecessary note, unity of form and variety of style,\r\nrhythm, and measure, and such superabundant animation that the hearer may\r\nwell ask himself whether every note is not actually alive.  Such are the\r\nproperties of Bach’s Fugues, properties which excite the admiration and\r\nastonishment of all who can appreciate the intellectual calibre their\r\ncomposition demands. How great a tribute of homage is due to work of this\r\nkind, which exhibits all the qualities which lend distinction to\r\ncompositions in other musical forms!  Moreover, while all Bach’s Fugues of\r\nhis mature period have the foregoing properties in common, each is endowed\r\nwith peculiar excellencies of its own, has its own distinctive\r\nindividuality, and displays a melodic and harmonic scheme in keeping with\r\nit.  The man who can play one of Bach’s Fugues is familiar with, and can\r\nplay, one only; whereas knowing one, we can perform portfolios of Fugues\r\nby other performers of Bach’s period.\r\n\r\nTo what a height was the art of Counterpoint carried by Bach’s genius!  It\r\nenabled him to develop out of a given subject a whole family of related\r\nand contrasted themes, of every form and design.  It taught him to develop\r\nan idea logically from the beginning to the end.  It gave him such a\r\ncommand of harmony and its infinite combinations that he could invert\r\nwhole themes, note by note, in every part, without impairing in the least\r\nthe flow of melody or purity of his harmony.  It taught him to write in\r\ncanon at all intervals and in movements of all kinds so easily and\r\nnaturally that the workmanship is not perceptible and the composition\r\nsounds as smoothly as though it were in the free style. Lastly, it has\r\ngiven to posterity a legacy of works immensely various, which are, and\r\nwill remain, models of contrapuntal form as long as music endures.(161)\r\n\r\nI have written exclusively so far of Bach’s Clavier and Organ work.  But\r\nin its expression music has two branches, instrumental and vocal, and as\r\nBach excels in both of them, the reader will desire to hear somewhat\r\nrespecting his vocal writings.\r\n\r\nIt was at Weimar that Bach first had occasion to write for the voice,(162)\r\nupon his appointment to the Kapelle, which imposed on him the provision of\r\nmusic for the ducal chapel.  His church music, like his Organ works, is\r\ndevout and serious, and in every respect what church music ought to be. He\r\nmakes a point also of not elaborating individual words, which leads to\r\nmere trifling, but interprets the text as a whole.(163) His choruses\r\ninvariably are magnificent and impressive, and he frequently introduces\r\nChorals into them,(164) making the other parts accompany their Cantus\r\nfugally, as was the practice in a Motet.  As elsewhere in his works, the\r\nharmonic structure of his voice parts and instrumental accompaniment is\r\nrich.  The declamation of the recitatives is expressive, and the latter\r\nhave fine Continuo parts.(165) In his Arias, hardly one of which is not\r\nbeautiful and expressive, Bach seems to have been handicapped by the\r\ninefficiency of his singers and instrumentalists, who constantly\r\ncomplained of the difficulty of his music.  If he had been fortunate\r\nenough to have capable performers the merits of his church music would\r\nhave been established and, like his other works, they would still be sung\r\nand admired; for they contain treasures which deserve immortality.(166)\r\n\r\nAmong the works composed at Leipzig I single out two Cantatas, one of\r\nwhich was performed at Cöthen at the funeral of Bach’s beloved Prince\r\nLeopold, and the other in St. Paul’s Church, Leipzig, on the occasion of\r\nthe funeral sermon in honour of Christiana Eberhardine, Queen of Poland\r\nand Electress of Saxony.(167) The first contains double choruses of\r\nuncommon magnificence and most affecting sentiment.(168) The second has\r\nonly four-part choruses, but they are so delightful and fresh that he who\r\nbegins the work will not pause till he has reached the end of it. It was\r\nwritten in October 1727.\r\n\r\nBach also composed a great number of Cantatas, chiefly for the choir of\r\nSt. Thomas’ School, Leipzig.(169) The choir ordinarily numbered fifty\r\nsingers, and sometimes more, over whose musical training Bach presided\r\nlike a father.  He practised them so hard in Cantatas for single and\r\ndouble chorus that they became excellent singers.  Among these works are\r\nsome which, in profundity of conception, magnificence, richness of harmony\r\nand melody, and animation, surpass everything of their kind. But, like all\r\nBach’s works, and in common with other masterpieces, they are difficult to\r\nperform and need a numerous orchestra to produce their full effect.\r\n\r\nSuch are Bach’s most important vocal compositions. (170) In minor forms of\r\nthe art, morceaux for social entertainments and the like, he wrote\r\nlittle,(171) though he was of a most sociable disposition. For instance,\r\nhe is said never to have composed a song.(172) And why should he?  They\r\nproduce themselves so spontaneously that there is little call for genius\r\nto aid their gestation.\r\n\r\n  [Johann Sebastian Bach.

BACH AS A TEACHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt not infrequently happens that talented composers and players are\r\nincapable of imparting their skill to others.  Either they have never\r\ntroubled to probe the mechanism of their own facility, or, through the\r\nexcellence of their instructors, have taken the short cut to proficiency\r\nand allowed their teacher and not their own judgment to decide how a thing\r\nshould be done.  Such people are useless to instruct beginners.  True,\r\nthey may succeed in teaching the rudiments of technique, assuming that\r\nthey have been properly taught themselves.  But they are certainly\r\nunqualified to teach in the full sense of the word.  There is, in fact,\r\nonly one way to become a good teacher, and that is to have gone through\r\nthe discipline of self-instruction, a path along which the beginner may go\r\nastray a thousand times before attaining to perfection. For it is just\r\nthis stumbling effort that reveals the dimensions of the art. The man who\r\nhas adventured it learns the obstacles that obstruct his path, and how to\r\nsurmount them. To be sure, it is a lengthy method. But if a man has\r\npatience to persevere he will reap a sure reward after an alluring\r\npilgrimage.  No musician ever founded a school of his own who has not\r\nfollowed such a course, and to his experience his teaching has owed its\r\ndistinctive character.\r\n\r\nThis is so with Bach, who, only gradually discovering his full stature,\r\nwas thirty years old before unremitting application raised him above the\r\ndifficulties of his art.  But he reaped his reward.  Self-discipline set\r\nhim on the fairest and most alluring path that it has ever been given to a\r\nmusician to tread.\r\n\r\nTo teach well a man needs to have a full mind. He must have discovered how\r\nto meet and have overcome the obstacles in his own path before he can be\r\nsuccessful in teaching others how to avoid them.  Bach united both\r\nqualities.  Hence, as a teacher he was the most instructive, clear, and\r\ndefinite that has ever been.  In every branch of his art he produced a\r\nband of pupils who followed in his footsteps, without, however, equalling\r\nhis achievement.\r\n\r\nFirst of all let me show how he taught the Clavier.(173) To begin with,\r\nhis pupils were made to acquire the special touch of which I have already\r\nspoken.(174) To that end for months together he made them practise nothing\r\nbut simple exercises for the fingers of both hands, at the same time\r\nemphasising the need for clearness and distinctness. He kept them at these\r\nexercises for from six to twelve months, unless he found his pupils losing\r\nheart, in which case he so far met them as to write short studies which\r\nincorporated a particular exercise.  Of this kind are the _Six Little\r\nPreludes for Beginners,_(175) and the _Fifteen Two-part Inventions,_(176)\r\nboth of which Bach wrote during the lesson for a particular pupil and\r\nafterwards improved into beautiful and expressive compositions.  Besides\r\nthis finger practice, either in regular exercises or in pieces composed\r\nfor the purpose, Bach introduced his pupils to the use of the various\r\nornaments in both hands.\r\n\r\nNot until this stage was reached did Bach allow his pupils to practise his\r\nown larger works, so admirably calculated, as he knew, to develop their\r\npowers.  In order to lessen their difficulty, it was his excellent habit\r\nto play over to them the pieces they were to study, with the remark,\r\n“That’s how it ought to sound.”(177) It would be difficult to exaggerate\r\nthe helpfulness of this method. The pupil’s interest was roused by hearing\r\nthe piece properly played. But that was not the sole result.  Without the\r\nhelp thus given the pupil could only hope to overcome the difficulties of\r\nthe piece after considerable effort, and would find it much less easy to\r\nrealise a proper rendering of it.  As it was, he received at once an ideal\r\nto aim at and was taught how to surmount the difficulties the piece\r\npresented.  Many a young performer, still imperfect after a year’s\r\npractice, probably would master his music in a month if he once had it\r\nplayed over to him.\r\n\r\nBach’s method of teaching composition was equally sure and effective.(178)\r\nHe did not begin with the dry details of counterpoint, as was the custom\r\nof other teachers in his day.  Still less did he burden his pupils with\r\nthe physical properties of sound, which he held to be matter for the\r\ntheorist and instrument-maker rather than the composer.  He started them\r\noff at once on four-part harmony over a figured Bass, making his pupils\r\nwrite each part on a separate stave in order to impress on them the need\r\nfor accurate harmonic progression.  Then he passed to Hymn tunes, setting\r\nthe Bass himself and making his pupils write the Tenor and Alto parts.  In\r\ntime he let them write the Bass also.  He insisted on correct harmony and\r\non each part having a real melodic line.  Every musician knows what models\r\nBach has left us in this form.  The inner parts of his four-part\r\nHymn-tunes are so smooth and melodious that often they might be taken for\r\nthe melody.  He made his pupils aim at similar tunefulness, and until they\r\nshowed a high standard of merit did not permit them to write compositions\r\nof their own.  Meanwhile he aimed at cultivating their feeling for pure\r\nharmony and for the order and connection of ideas and parts by\r\nfamiliarising them with the compositions of others.  Until they had\r\nacquired facility in those qualities he neither permitted them nor held\r\nthem competent to put pen to paper.\r\n\r\nBach required his pupils in composition to work out their musical ideas\r\nmentally.  If any of them lacked this faculty he admonished him not to\r\ncompose and discountenanced even his sons from attempting to write until\r\nthey had first given evidence of genuine musical gifts.  Having completed\r\ntheir elementary study of harmony, Bach took his pupils on to the theory\r\nof Fugue, beginning with two-part writing.  In these and other exercises\r\nhe insisted on the pupil composing away from the Clavier.(179) Those who\r\ndid otherwise he ridiculed as “Harpsichord Knights.”  In the second place\r\nhe required rigorous attention to each part and its relation to the\r\nconcurrent parts, permitting none, not even an inner one, to break off\r\nbefore it had finished what it had to say.  He insisted upon a correct\r\nrelation between each note and its predecessor.  If he came upon one whose\r\nderivation or destination was not perfectly clear he struck it out as\r\nfaulty.  It is, indeed, a meticulous exactitude in each individual part\r\nthat makes Bach’s harmony really multiple melody.  Confused part-writing,\r\nwhere a note that belongs to the Tenor is given to the Alto, or vice\r\nversa, or the haphazard addition of extraneous parts to a chord which\r\nsuddenly shows an increase of notes as if fallen from the sky, to vanish\r\nas suddenly as they came, are faults found neither in his own nor his\r\npupils’ writing.  He regarded his musical parts as so many persons engaged\r\nin conversation. If there are three, each of them on occasion may be\r\nsilent and listen to the others until it finds something relevant to say\r\nitself.  But if, at an interesting point of the conversation, an\r\ninterloping voice intervened, Bach regarded it as an intruder and let his\r\npupils understand that it could not be admitted.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his strictness on this point, Bach allowed his pupils\r\nconsiderable licence in other respects.  In their use of certain\r\nintervals, as in their treatment of harmony and melody, he let them\r\nexperiment within the limits of their ability, taking care to\r\ndiscountenance ugliness and to insist on their giving appropriate\r\nexpression to the character of the composition.  Beauty of expression, he\r\npostulated, was only attainable on a foundation of pure and accurate\r\nharmony.  Having experimented in every form himself, he liked to see his\r\npupils equally adventurous. Earlier teachers of composition, for instance,\r\nBerardi,(180) Buononcini,(181) and Fux,(182) did not allow such liberty.\r\nThey were afraid to trust their pupils to encounter difficulties, and\r\nshort-sightedly prevented them from learning how to overcome them.  Bach’s\r\nsystem was wiser, for it took his pupils farther, since he did not limit\r\ntheir attention, as his predecessors did, to the harmonic structure, but\r\nextended it to the qualities that constitute good writing, namely,\r\nconsistency of expression, variety of style, rhythm, and melody.  Those\r\nwho would acquaint themselves with Bach’s method of teaching composition\r\nwill find it fully set forth in Kirnberger’s _Correct Art of\r\nComposition._(183)\r\n\r\nAs long as his pupils were under his instruction Bach did not allow them\r\nto study any but his own works and the classics.  The critical sense,\r\nwhich permits a man to distinguish good from bad, develops later than the\r\naesthetic faculty and may be blunted and even destroyed by frequent\r\ncontact with bad music.  The best way to instruct youth is to accustom it\r\nearly to consort with the best models.  Time brings experience and an\r\ninstructed judgment to confirm the pupil’s early attraction to works of\r\ntrue art.\r\n\r\nUnder this admirable method of teaching all Bach’s pupils became\r\ndistinguished musicians, some more so than others, according as they came\r\nearly or late under his influence, and had opportunity and encouragement\r\nto perfect and apply the instruction they received from him.  His two\r\neldest sons, Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emmanuel, were his most\r\ndistinguished pupils, not because he gave them better instruction than the\r\nrest, but because from their earliest youth they were brought up amid good\r\nmusic at home.  Even before they began their lessons they knew what was\r\ngood.  On the other hand, others, before they became Bach’s pupils, either\r\nhad heard no good music or their taste had been already vitiated by\r\ncontact with bad.  It at least attests the excellence of Bach’s method\r\nthat even his pupils thus handicapped took high rank in their profession\r\nand distinguished themselves in one or other of its branches.(184)\r\n\r\nBach’s first pupil was JOHANN CASPAR VOGLER, who received instruction from\r\nhim in his early days at Amstadt and Weimar and, on Bach’s testimony, was\r\nan exceedingly able player.  He became organist, and later burgomaster, at\r\nWeimar, retaining his professional position.  Some Choral Preludes by him\r\nfor a two-manualed Organ with pedals were engraved about 1737.(185)\r\n\r\nOther pupils of Bach who became famous were:\r\n\r\n      1. HOMILIUS, of Dresden.  He was not only an excellent organist but\r\n      a distinguished composer of church music as well.(186)\r\n      2. TRANSCHEL, of Dresden. He was a fine musician and performer on\r\n      the Clavier. There exist in MS. six Polonaises by him which perhaps\r\n      are superior to those of any composer but Wilhelm Friedemann\r\n      Bach.(187)\r\n      3. GOLDBERG, of Königsberg. He was a very finished player on the\r\n      Clavier, but without any marked talent for composition.(188)\r\n      4. KREBS, Organist at Altenburg. He was not only a player of the\r\n      first rank, but also a prolific composer for the Organ, Clavier, and\r\n      of church music. He was fortunate in having Bach’s instruction for\r\n      nine years.(189)\r\n      5. ALTNIKOL, Organist at Naumburg.  He was Bach’s son-in-law and is\r\n      said to have been a very competent player and composer.(190)\r\n      6. AGRICOLA, Court Composer at Berlin.(191) He is less known as a\r\n      composer than as a theorist. He translated Tosi’s(192) _II canto\r\n      figurato_ from Italian into German and provided the work with an\r\n      instructive commentary.\r\n      7. MÜTHEL, of Riga.  He was a good Clavier player and wrote for that\r\n      instrument.  His Sonatas and a Duet for two Claviers attest his\r\n      ability as a composer.(193)\r\n      8. KIRNBERGER,(194) Court Musician at Berlin to the Princess Amalia\r\n      of Prussia.(195) He was one of the most distinguished of Bach’s\r\n      pupils, full of genuine enthusiasm for his art and eager to assure\r\n      its interests.  Besides his exposition of Bach’s system of teaching\r\n      composition, we are indebted to him for the first logical treatise\r\n      on harmony, in which he sets forth his master’s teaching and\r\n      practice.  The first work is entitled _Kunst des reinen Satzes,_ and\r\n      the second, _Wahre Grundsätze zum Gebrauch der Harmonie._(196) He\r\n      served the interests of his art also by other writings and\r\n      compositions, and was an excellent teacher. The Princess Amalia was\r\n      his pupil.\r\n      9. KITTEL, Organist at Erfurt.  He is a sound, though not a\r\n      finished, player, and is distinguished as a composer by several\r\n      Organ Trios, so excellent that Bach himself might have written them.\r\n      He is the sole survivor (1802) of Bach’s pupils.(197)\r\n      10. VOIGT, of Anspach,(198) and an organist named SCHUBART(199) were\r\n      mentioned to me by Carl Philipp Emmanuel as having been Bach’s\r\n      pupils.  He knew nothing about them except that they entered his\r\n      father’s house after he left it.(200)\r\n\r\nI have said already that Bach’s sons were his most distinguished pupils.\r\nThe eldest, WILHELM FRIEDEMANN BACH, came nearest to his father in the\r\noriginality of his genius.  His melodies have quite a different character\r\nfrom those of other composers.  They are exceedingly clever, elegant, and\r\nspontaneous.  When performed with delicacy, as he played them, they cannot\r\nfail to charm every hearer.  It is greatly to be regretted that he\r\npreferred to follow his fancy in extemporisation and to expend his genius\r\non fugitive thoughts rather than to work them out on paper.  The number of\r\nhis compositions therefore is small, but all are beautiful.\r\n\r\nCARL PHILIPP EMMANUEL BACH, who comes next, went out into the world\r\nsufficiently early to discover that it is a good thing for a composer to\r\nhave a large public behind him.  Hence, in the clearness and easy\r\nintelligibility of his compositions, he approaches the popular style,\r\nthough he scrupulously avoids the commonplace.(201) Both he and his elder\r\nbrother admitted that they were driven to adopt a style of their own by\r\nthe wish to avoid comparison with their incomparable father.\r\n\r\nJOHANN CHRISTOPH FRIEDRICH BACH, Concertmeister at the Court of Bückeburg,\r\nimitated Carl Philipp’s style, but was not his equal. According to Wilhelm\r\nFriedemann, he was the best player among the brothers, and the most\r\neffective performer of their father’s Clavier compositions.\r\n\r\nJOHANN CHRISTIAN BACH, called “Bach of Milan,” and afterwards “Bach of\r\nLondon,” was the youngest son of Bach’s second marriage and of too tender\r\nan age when his father died ever to have had lessons from him.  Hence,\r\nperhaps, the absence of Bach’s style in his music.  He was, in fact, a\r\npopular composer universally admired in his day.(202)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.  PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nDistinguished as a player, composer, and teacher, Bach was also an\r\nindulgent father, a good friend, and a loyal citizen.  His paternal\r\ndevotion is shown by his care for his children’s education, and he was\r\nequally assiduous in the performance of his civil and social duties.  His\r\nacquaintance was agreeable to everybody.  Every lover of music, whatever\r\nhis nationality, was sure of a friendly reception at his house, and his\r\nsociability and reputation caused him to be seldom without visitors.\r\n\r\nAs an artist Bach was exceptionally modest. Notwithstanding his\r\npre-eminence in his profession, a superiority of which he could not but be\r\nconscious, and in spite of the admiration and respect daily shown him, he\r\nnever gave himself airs.  If he was asked the secret of his mastership he\r\nwould answer, “I was made to work; if you are equally industrious you will\r\nbe equally successful,”(203) a remark which made no allowance for his own\r\nexceptional genius.  His opinion of other composers and their work was\r\ninvariably fair and generous.  Naturally, much of their work struck him as\r\nsomewhat trivial, viewed from his own altitude.  But he never uttered a\r\nharsh criticism, unless it were to a pupil, to whom he held himself bound\r\nto say what he thought.  Still less did he presume on his acknowledged\r\nsuperiority to indulge in braggadocio, as often happens with performers\r\nbrought into touch with those whom they regard as their inferiors.  Herein\r\nBach’s modesty went so far that he never spoke voluntarily of his\r\nfrustrated contest with Marchand, though the latter was the\r\nchallenger.(204) Many absurd stories are told of Bach; for instance that,\r\ndressed up as a village schoolmaster, he liked to enter a church and ask\r\nthe organist to let him play a Choral, in order to enjoy the astonishment\r\nexcited by his playing, or to hear the Organist declare, “This must be\r\nBach or the Devil.”(205) He always ridiculed such stories, and indeed had\r\ntoo much respect for his art to make it cloak his vanity.\r\n\r\nAt musical parties where Quartet or other instrumental music was\r\nperformed, Bach liked to play the Viola, an instrument which put him, as\r\nit were, in the middle of the harmony in a position from which he could\r\nhear and enjoy it on both sides.  On those occasions he would sometimes\r\njoin in a Trio or other piece on the Harpsichord. If he was in the mood\r\nand the composer was agreeable, he would, as has been told already,\r\nextemporise a new Trio from the Continuo part, or, adding a new part,\r\nconvert the Trio into a Quartet. But these were the only occasions on\r\nwhich he was ready to display his great powers before others.  One\r\nHurlebusch, of Brunswick,(206) a conceited and arrogant Clavier player,\r\nonce visited Bach at Leipzig, not to hear him play, but to play to him.\r\nBach received him politely and listened patiently to his very indifferent\r\nperformance. On taking leave Hurlebusch made Bach’s eldest sons a present\r\nof his published Sonatas, exhorting them to study them diligently. Bach,\r\nknowing the kind of music his sons were wont to play, smiled at\r\nHurlebusch’s naïveté but did not permit him to suspect his amusement.(207)\r\n\r\nBach was fond of listening to the music of other composers. If he and one\r\nof his elder sons happened to be in church when a Fugue was played,\r\ndirectly the subject had been stated he always pointed out how it ought to\r\nbe developed.  If the composer knew his business and fulfilled Bach’s\r\nanticipations, he was pleased and nudged his son to draw his attention to\r\nthe fact.  Is this not evidence of his impartial interest in other\r\npeople’s compositions?\r\n\r\nI have mentioned already the composers whom in his youth Bach esteemed,\r\nloved, and studied. Later, when experience ripened his critical faculty,\r\nhe had other favourites, among them Imperial Kapellmeister Fux, Handel,\r\nCaldara,(208) Reinhard Keiser, Hasse,(209) the two Grauns,(210)\r\nTelemann,(211) Zelenka,(212) Benda,(213) etc., and, in general, the\r\ndistinguished musicians at Dresden and Berlin.  He was acquainted with all\r\nexcept the first four of those I mention.  In his youth Bach was intimate\r\nwith Telemann.(214) He also had a very warm regard for Handel and often\r\nexpressed a desire to know him.  As Handel, like himself, was a famous\r\nperformer on the Organ and Clavier, many in Leipzig and its neighbourhood\r\nwished to bring the two great men together.  But Handel, then living in\r\nLondon, never found time for a meeting during the visits he paid to Halle,\r\nhis native town.  On his first visit in 1719, Bach was at Cöthen, only\r\nsome twenty miles distant.  As soon as he was informed of Handel’s arrival\r\nhe lost not a moment in setting out to visit him, but on his arrival found\r\nthat Handel had returned to England.  At the time of Handel’s second\r\nvisit, between 1730 and 1740,(215) Bach was prevented from leaving Leipzig\r\nby indisposition.  But no sooner was he advised of Handel’s arrival at\r\nHalle than he sent his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, to beg him to visit\r\nLeipzig, an invitation which Handel was unable to accept.  In 1752 or\r\n1753, when Handel paid his third visit to Germany,(216) Bach was dead. He\r\nhad always expressed the strongest desire to know Handel, and the Leipzig\r\npeople were disappointed in their wish to hear the two great men together.\r\n\r\nWhile Hasse was Kapellmeister at Dresden both the Opera and Kapelle\r\nflourished.  Bach had many friends at Dresden, who held him in high\r\nregard.  Among them may be mentioned Hasse and his wife, the celebrated\r\nFaustina.(217) They often visited Leipzig and were admirers of the\r\nCantor’s rare talents.  Hence, at Dresden he was always received in the\r\nmost respectful manner and often visited the Opera, generally accompanied\r\nby his eldest son.  When the time for their journey approached Bach would\r\nsay in fun, “Well, Friedemann, shall we go to Dresden to hear the pretty\r\ntunes(218) again?” Innocent as the jest was, I am sure Bach would not have\r\nuttered it to any but his son, who already could distinguish between great\r\nmusic and agreeable trifles.\r\n\r\nBach was never in a position to make what is called a brilliant\r\nfortune.(219) He held a fairly lucrative office, but his income had to\r\nmaintain and educate a large family.  He neither possessed nor sought\r\nother means of livelihood, and was too absorbed in his art and work to\r\nthink of accepting engagements which, in those days, and to a man of his\r\ngenius, certainly would have brought riches. Had he possessed a taste for\r\ntravel he would, as even one of his detractors admits, have “drawn upon\r\nhimself the admiration of the whole world.” But he preferred a quiet\r\ndomestic life, constant occupation in his work, with contentment and a\r\nmoderate competence, like his forbears. His modesty, however, did hot\r\nprevent him from receiving manifold proofs of regard and affection and\r\nmarks of honourable distinction. Prince Leopold of Cöthen, Duke Ernst\r\nAugust of Weimar,(220) and Duke Christian of Weissenfels, all showed\r\nsincere regard for him, which must have been the more agreeable to him\r\nseeing that they were all sound judges of music.  At Berlin, as at\r\nDresden, he was universally honoured and respected. If we add to these\r\ntestimonies the fact that he captured the admiration of all who heard him\r\nplay or were acquainted with his music, then we may be sure that Bach,\r\n“singing for himself and the Muses,” received at the hands of Fame the\r\nrecognition he valued most, and cherished it far more than the trivial\r\nhonour of a ribbon or gold chain.\r\n\r\nI add that, in 1747, Bach became a member of the “Society of the Musical\r\nSciences,” founded by Mizler, only because we owe to the circumstance his\r\nadmirable Choral Variations on _Vom Himmel hoch._(221) He presented them\r\nto the Society on his admission and they were engraved subsequently.(222)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. BACH’S COMPOSITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have produced so many great works in all forms of musical expression\r\nBach necessarily must have been a prolific writer.  For if a composer be\r\nthe greatest genius in the world, unless he constantly exercises his art\r\nhe cannot hope to produce real masterpieces.  Superlative excellence is\r\nthe fruit of indefatigable application.  Yet in Bach’s case we should be\r\nwrong to acclaim as masterpieces all the products of his great activity\r\njust because masterpieces at length were the fruit of it.  Already in his\r\nearly compositions we find undeniable evidence of genius.  But they are\r\nblemished by faults, passages poor in quality, extravagant, insipid, that\r\nare hardly worth preserving, though of interest to the student who wishes\r\nto trace from its source the development of Bach’s genius.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to distinguish with exactitude those of Bach’s early\r\ncompositions which are of the first excellence; for he has been at pains\r\nto give us the clue.  As he did not publish his first work until he was\r\nabout forty years old (223) we are justified in assuming the merit of\r\nwhat, at so mature an age, he thought worthy to put into print, and in\r\nconcluding generally that all his engraved works are of first-rate\r\nmerit.(224)\r\n\r\nWith respect to his unpublished compositions, and they are by far the most\r\nnumerous, we must in order to distinguish their merit rely partly on a\r\ncritical examination of their texts, partly on Bach’s own judgment.  Like\r\nall great composers, he was continually working on his compositions with a\r\nview to making them still more finished.  Indeed, he actually attempted to\r\nimprove some of them that were already perfect.  Any that were susceptible\r\nof improvement he improved, even those already engraved.  Such is the\r\norigin of the variant readings of his works found in older and more recent\r\ntexts.  By constantly retouching his compositions Bach aimed at making\r\nthem indisputable masterpieces.  In this category I place most of what he\r\nwrote before the year 1725, as I show in detail in the following\r\ncatalogue.  A great many compositions subsequent to 1725, which for\r\nreasons easily understood are still in MS., bear too evidently the stamp\r\nof perfection to leave us in doubt whether to class them as early essays\r\nor as the finished work of an accomplished master.\r\n\r\nThe following are those of Bach’s works which have been engraved:\r\n\r\n      1. _Clavierübung_, or “Exercises for the Clavier, consisting of\r\n      Preludes, Allemandes, Courantes, Sarabandes, Gigues, Minuets, etc.,\r\n      for the Diversion of Amateurs. Opus I. Published by the Composer,\r\n      1731.”  This was Bach’s first published work and contains six\r\n      Suites.  The first of them came out in 1726;(225) the others\r\n      followed in successive years until all were engraved together in\r\n      1731.(226) The work was much noticed at the time.  Such compositions\r\n      for the Clavier had not been seen or heard before, and the man who\r\n      could play them was sure of a success.  Our young players to-day\r\n      would profit by the study of them, so brilliant, agreeable,\r\n      expressive, and original are they. In the new edition(227) they are\r\n      entitled, “Exercises for the Clavier.”\r\n      2. _Clavierübung_, or “Exercises for the Clavier, Part II.,\r\n      consisting of a Concerto in the Italian style and an Overture in the\r\n      French manner(228) for a Clavier with two manuals.  Published by\r\n      Christopher Weigel, Junior, in Nürnberg.”(229)\r\n      3. _Clavierübung_, or “Exercises for the Clavier, Part III.,\r\n      consisting of various Organ Preludes to the Catechism and other\r\n      Hymns, composed for the diversion of amateurs and particularly of\r\n      competent judges of such works.  Published by the Composer.”\r\n      Besides the Preludes and Fugues for the Organ, all of which are\r\n      masterly, the book contains four Duetti for the Clavier,(230) models\r\n      of their kind.\r\n      4. _Sechs Choräle_, or “Six Choral Melodies of different kinds, for\r\n      an Organ with two manuals and pedal.  Zella, in the Thuringian\r\n      Forest.  Published by Johann G. Schübler.”(231) They are full of\r\n      dignity and religious feeling.  In some of them, too, we have\r\n      instances of Bach’s original management of the stops.(232) Thus, in\r\n      the second Choral, _Wo soll ich fliehen hin,_ he gives to the first\r\n      manual an 8 foot, to the second a 16 foot, and to the pedal a 4 foot\r\n      stop.  The pedal has the cantus firmus.(233)\r\n      5. _Clavierübung_, or “Exercises for the Clavier, consisting of an\r\n      Aria with several Variations, for a Clavier with two manuals.\r\n      Published by Balthasar Schmidt at Nürnberg.”(234) This admirable\r\n      work consists of thirty Variations, some in canon, in a variety of\r\n      movements and at all intervals from the unison to the ninth, with\r\n      easy flowing melody.  It includes a regular fourpart Fugue,(235)\r\n      several extremely brillant Variations for two Claviers,(236) and\r\n      concludes with a Quodlibet, as it is called, which alone would\r\n      render its composer immortal, though it is not the best thing in the\r\n      volume.(237)\r\n\r\n      The Variations are models of what such compositions ought to be,\r\n      though no one has been so rash as to attempt to follow Bach’s\r\n      footsteps. We owe them to Count Kaiserling, formerly Russian\r\n      Ambassador at the Saxon Electoral Court, who frequently visited\r\n      Leipzig with Goldberg, already mentioned(238) among Bach’s pupils.\r\n      The Count was a great invalid and suffered from insomnia.  Goldberg\r\n      lived in the Ambassador’s house, and slept in an adjoining room, to\r\n      be ready to play to him when he was wakeful.  One day the Count\r\n      asked Bach to write for Goldberg some Clavier music of a soothing\r\n      and cheerful character, that would relieve the tedium of sleepless\r\n      nights.  Bach thought a set of Variations most likely to fulfil the\r\n      Count’s needs, though, on account of the recurrence of the same\r\n      basic harmony throughout, it was a form to which he had hitherto\r\n      paid little attention.  Like all his compositions at this period,\r\n      however, the Variations are a masterpiece, and are the only example\r\n      he has left us of this form.(239) The Count always called them “my\r\n      Variations” and was never weary of hearing them.  For long\r\n      afterwards, when he could not sleep, he would say, “Play me one of\r\n      my Variations, Goldberg.” Perhaps Bach was never so well rewarded\r\n      for any composition as for this.  The Count gave him a golden goblet\r\n      containing one hundred louis d’ors, though, as a work of art, Bach\r\n      would not have been overpaid had the present been a thousand times\r\n      as large.  It may be observed, that in the engraved copy of the\r\n      Variations there are serious mistakes, which the composer has\r\n      corrected in his own copy.(240)\r\n\r\n      6. _Einige kanonische Verdäderungen,_ “Canonic Variations on the\r\n      Christmas Hymn ‘Vom Himmel hoch da komm ich her,’ for an Organ with\r\n      two manuals and pedal. Published at Nürnberg by Balthasar Schmidt.”\r\n      The work contains five canonic variations of the utmost\r\n      ingenuity.(241)\r\n      7. _Musikalisches Opfer_, or “A Musical Offering,” dedicated to\r\n      Frederick II., King of Prussia.  The theme received by Bach from the\r\n      King(242) is treated first as a three-part Fugue under the acrostic\r\n      title “Ricercare” (Regis iussu cantio et reliqua canonica arte\r\n      resoluta). There follows a six-part “Ricercare” and Thematis regii\r\n      elaborationes canonicae of various kinds.(243) The work includes a\r\n      Trio for Flute, Violin, and Clavier upon the same subject.(244)\r\n      8. _Die Kunst der Fuge_, or “The Art of Fugue.”  This work, unique\r\n      of its kind, did not appear till about 1752, after Bach’s death,\r\n      though the greater part of it had been engraved by his sons during\r\n      his lifetime.(245) Marpurg,(246) the leading German musical critic\r\n      of that day, contributed a preface to this edition which contains\r\n      many just observations on the value and utility of such\r\n      treatises.(247) But, being too good for the general public, the work\r\n      found only a small circulation among those who discerned its merit\r\n      and eagerly bought copies. The plates were never used again and\r\n      eventually were sold(248) by Bach’s heirs at the price of old\r\n      copper.  Written by a man of Bach’s transcendent genius, and\r\n      commended as a masterpiece by a critic so highly regarded as\r\n      Marpurg, a work of this kind, if published in any other country than\r\n      Germany, would have passed through at least ten editions by now, if\r\n      only at the bidding of patriotism.  But in Germany not a sufficient\r\n      number of copies was sold to pay for the plates used in engraving\r\n      the work!\r\n\r\n      The work consists of fugal Variations planned on the most elaborate\r\n      scale.(249) The composer’s intention was to show in what a variety\r\n      of ways the same theme can be treated fugally.  The Variations (here\r\n      called “Contrapunctus”)(250) are complete Fugues upon the same\r\n      theme.  The last Fugue of all has three subjects, in the third of\r\n      which the composer signs his name, B A C H.(251) Bach was prevented\r\n      from finishing it by the disorder of his eyes, and as an operation\r\n      brought no relief the movement was never completed.  It is said that\r\n      Bach intended to introduce four themes into it and to bring it to an\r\n      impressive conclusion by inverting them all. All the Fugues in the\r\n      work are equally smooth and melodious.\r\n\r\n      To make up for the unfinished Fugue Bach concluded the work with a\r\n      Choral Prelude upon the tune “Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein,”\r\n      which he dictated to his son-in-law, Altnikol, a few days before his\r\n      death.(252) Of the extraordinary skill it displays I do not speak,\r\n      save to remark that even in his last illness it proclaims Bach’s\r\n      skill undiminished.  The pious resignation and devotion that\r\n      characterise it move me deeply whenever I play it.  Nor should I\r\n      find it easy to say which I had rather had been omitted, the Choral\r\n      Prelude, or the conclusion of the unfinished Fugue.\r\n\r\n      9. Lastly, after Bach’s death, his four-part Chorals were collected\r\n      by his son, Carl Philipp Emmanuel, and were published by Birnstiel\r\n      (Berlin and Leipzig), Part I. in 1765, Part II. in 1769.(253) Each\r\n      Part contains one hundred Chorals, mostly taken from the composer’s\r\n      church Cantatas.\r\n\r\n      More recently Kirnberger edited, in four volumes, a collection of\r\n      Bach’s Chorals. They are published by Breitkopf.(254)\r\n\r\n      Bach’s works, still in MS., consist of compositions for the Clavier,\r\n      Organ, with and without other instruments, Strings, and the voice.\r\n      I will enumerate them in that order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     I. Compositions For The Clavier\r\n\r\n\r\n      1. _Six Little Preludes far Beginners_.(255)\r\n      2. _Fifteen Two-part Inventions_.  An Invention is a musical theme\r\n      so constructed that by imitation and inversion a whole movement can\r\n      be evolved from it.  The subject having been first stated, the rest\r\n      develops naturally out of it.  For the instruction of a young\r\n      Clavier player these fifteen Inventions are of great value, seeing\r\n      that the composer has been careful not only to provide exercises for\r\n      both hands but for every finger as well.  They were composed at\r\n      Cöthen in 1723, with a long title which begins: “An honest Guide, in\r\n      which lovers of the Clavier are shown a clear method of playing\r\n      correctly in two parts,” etc.(256)\r\n\r\n      It cannot be denied that, among other blemishes, the Inventions\r\n      occasionally exhibit melodic poverty and roughness.  But finding\r\n      them useful to his pupils, Bach eventually revised them and removed\r\n      from them everything that offended his maturer taste, so that they\r\n      now stand as masterpieces of pure music.  Moreover they are\r\n      invaluable exercises for the fingers and hands and are sound\r\n      instructors of taste.  There is no better introduction to Bach’s\r\n      larger works than they afford.\r\n\r\n      3. _Fifteen three-part Inventions_, also called Symphonies.  They\r\n      were written for the same purpose as the Inventions, but are more\r\n      advanced.(257)\r\n      4. _The Well-tempered Clavier_, or, Preludes and Fugues in all tones\r\n      and semitones, composed for the profit and use of young musicians\r\n      desirous of knowledge, as also for those who are skilled already in\r\n      this studio.  Part I. was finished in 1722.  Part II., like Part I.,\r\n      contains twenty-four Preludes and twenty-four Fugues in every key,\r\n      and was composed at a later period.(258) Every number of it, from\r\n      first to last, is a masterpiece.  In Part I., however, certain\r\n      Preludes and Fugues bear marks of immaturity and are included\r\n      probably only in order to complete the series.  But here again Bach\r\n      eventually corrected whatever seemed to him lacking in finish.  He\r\n      altered or rewrote entire passages, so that in the later texts few\r\n      movements are not perfect.  Among these few I reckon the Fugues in A\r\n      minor,(259) G major and G minor,(260) C major,(261) F major and F\r\n      minor.(262) The rest are excellent, some of them so superlatively\r\n      good as to be not inferior to those in Part II.(263) Even Part II.,\r\n      for all its original perfection, has been improved by the composer,\r\n      as may be observed by comparing the original and later texts.  Both\r\n      Parts contain treasures of art not to be found outside Germany.\r\n      5. _Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue._(264) I have taken considerable\r\n      pains to discover a similar piece of music by Bach, but without\r\n      success.  The Fantasia is unique and unequalled.  Wilhelm Friedemann\r\n      sent it to me from Brunswick inscribed with these words by a mutual\r\n      friend. “Anbey kommt an etwas Musik von Sebastian, sonst genannt:\r\n      Fantasia chromatica; bleibt schön in alle Saecula.”\r\n\r\n      It is remarkable that this piece, for all its technical skill,\r\n      appeals to the most unpractised hearer, if it is performed at all\r\n      tolerably.\r\n\r\n      6. A _Fantasia in C minor_.  It is not of the same character as the\r\n      preceding work, but resembles rather the Allegro of a Sonata.  It is\r\n      divided into two parts, but must be played as a single movement.  It\r\n      is an excellent work, and in old copies an unfinished Fugue follows,\r\n      which, however, cannot belong to it.(265) The first thirty bars\r\n      certainly are by Bach, for they are marked by an extremely bold use\r\n      of augmented and diminished intervals and their inversions, in\r\n      three-part harmony.  None but Bach attempted such things. The rest\r\n      of the movement seems to have been added by another hand and bears\r\n      no trace of Bach’s style.\r\n      7. _Six large Suites_, consisting of Preludes, Allemandes,\r\n      Courantes, Sarabandes, etc.  They are known as the “English Suites,”\r\n      because the composer wrote them for an Englishman of rank.(266)  All\r\n      of them are of great merit as works of art, and some movements, in\r\n      particular the Gigues of the fifth and sixth Suites, are perfect\r\n      masterpieces of harmony and melody.\r\n      8. _Six small Suites_, consisting of Allemandes, Courantes, etc.\r\n      They are generally called the “French Suites,” because they are\r\n      written in the French style.(267) The composer is intentionally less\r\n      academic in them than in his larger Suites, and their melodies are\r\n      more than usually pleasant and agreeable.  In particular the fifth\r\n      Suite deserves to be noticed: all its movements are most melodious,\r\n      and in the concluding Gigue only consonant intervals, especially\r\n      thirds and sixths, are used.\r\n\r\nThese are Bach’s principal works for the Clavier which can be considered\r\nclassics.(268) A great number of single Suites,(269)Toccatas and\r\nFugues,(270) besides those already mentioned, have great and varying\r\nmerit, but are youthful works.(271) At the most, ten or twelve of them\r\nseem to me worth preserving, some of them because they would be useful as\r\nfinger exercises, for which their author originally intended them, others\r\nbecause they are at least better than similar works by other composers.\r\nAs an exercise for the fingers of both hands I particularly single out a\r\nFugue in A minor,(272) in which the composer has been at great pains to\r\nwrite florid passages in order to give equal strength and suppleness to\r\nboth hands.  For beginners a little two-part Fugue(273) should also prove\r\nuseful.  It is melodious, flowing, and not at all old-fashioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             II. Music For The Clavier With Other Instruments\r\n\r\n\r\n      1. _Six Sonatas for Clavier with Violin obbligato_.  Composed at\r\n      Cöthen, they are among Bach’s masterpieces in this form and display\r\n      fugal and canonic writing which is both natural and full of\r\n      character.  The Violin part needs a master to play it; for Bach knew\r\n      the capabilities of the instrument and spared it as little as the\r\n      Clavier.  The six Sonatas are in the keys of B minor, A major, E\r\n      major, C minor, F minor, and G major.(274)\r\n      2. _Several Sonatas for Harpsichord and Violin_,(275) _Harpsichord\r\n      and Flute_,(276) _Harpsichord and Viol da Gamba_.(277) They are\r\n      admirably written and most of them are pleasant to listen to even\r\n      today.(278)\r\n      3. _Several Concertos for the Clavier and other instruments_.  They\r\n      contain real gems of art but are antiquated in form.(279)\r\n      4. _Two Concertos for two Claviers_, with an accompaniment of two\r\n      Violins, Viola, and Violoncello.  The first, in C minor,(280) has an\r\n      antique flavour. But the second, in C major,(281) is as fresh as if\r\n      it had been written yesterday.(282) It may be played without the\r\n      String quartet and still sounds admirable.  The final Allegro is a\r\n      majestic movement and strictly fugal.  Compositions of this form\r\n      were first perfected, indeed, we may conjecture, were first\r\n      attempted, by Bach.  At least, I have met with only a single example\r\n      by another composer that may perhaps be older—namely, Pachelbel of\r\n      Nürnberg’s Toccata, as he called it.  Pachelbel, however, was a\r\n      contemporary of Bach and may have taken the idea from him.  However,\r\n      his work is not worth considering.  One instrument merely repeats\r\n      the other’s phrases without being at all concertante.  It almost\r\n      seems as if Bach at this period had made up his mind to discover\r\n      what could be done with any number of parts. Having already written\r\n      for a single solo instrument music which required no accompaniment,\r\n      he next experimented in dividing his material between as large a\r\n      number of solo instruments as possible.  Hence the Concertos for two\r\n      Claviers were followed by\r\n      5. _Two Concertos for three Claviers_ with an accompaniment of\r\n      Strings.(283) These Concertos present a remarkable characteristic:\r\n      besides the concertante combination of three Claviers, the stringed\r\n      instruments also have concertante parts distinct from the\r\n      accompaniment.  It is difficult to realise the art involved in this\r\n      achievement.  For, in spite of their technical skill, the two works\r\n      are so delicate, full of character, and expressive, that the\r\n      composer might be treating a simple melody (note particularly the\r\n      Concerto in D minor).  Words are inadequate to express the\r\n      admiration they arouse.  But Bach was not satisfied.  Hence he wrote\r\n      6. _A Concerto for four Claviers_ and four stringed\r\n      instruments.(284) I cannot judge the effect of this composition, for\r\n      I have never been able to get together the four instruments and four\r\n      performers it requires.  But that it is admirably written can be\r\n      seen from the parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     III. Compositions For The Organ\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pedal is the distinctive feature of the Organ which places it above\r\nall other instruments, and gives it its magnificence, sonority, and\r\nmajesty.  Deprive it of the pedal and you take from it the solemn and\r\nimposing tones which are its distinctive utterance, reducing it to the\r\nlevel of a “positiv,” or Chamber-organ, an instrument relatively\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nBut an Organ equipped with a pedal must be able to employ it in its full\r\ncompass,(285) and both composer and organist must know the proper use of\r\nit.  No one excelled Bach in this knowledge.  Not only is his rich harmony\r\nand melody singularly adapted to the instrument, but he gave the pedal a\r\npart of its own, even in his early compositions.  Yet it was only\r\ngradually that he mastered its technique; for his Organ masterpieces\r\nbelong to the period in which those for the Clavier began to be classics.\r\nHis early and immature Organ works are widely dispersed; for as soon as a\r\ncomposer begins to be distinguished everybody is anxious to possess a\r\nspecimen of his art.  Public curiosity, however, generally dies down long\r\nbefore a composer comes to maturity, particularly if his work is over the\r\nheads of the public.  And this seems to have been Bach’s fortune.\r\nConsequently his mature Organ works are less familiar than his early\r\nefforts.  The latter, however, cannot possibly be admitted to a “correct\r\nand critical” edition of his works, and I mention here only those whose\r\nmerit is as incontestable as that of the Clavier works enumerated in the\r\npreceding paragraphs.\r\n\r\nBach’s finest Organ music falls into three groups:\r\n\r\n      1. _The Great Preludes and Fugues_, with obbligato pedal.  Their\r\n      number cannot be stated, but I believe it not to exceed a\r\n      dozen.(286) At least, after prolonged search I have not been able to\r\n      collect more than that number.(287) To these I must add a very\r\n      clever and original Passacaglia, which, however, seems suitable\r\n      rather for a two-manual Clavicembalo and pedal than for the\r\n      Organ.(288)\r\n      2. _Preludes on Choral Melodies_. It was at Arnstadt that Bach began\r\n      to compose Variations on Choral melodies, under the title _Partite\r\n      diverse._(289) Most of them can be played on the manuals alone.\r\n      Those which I include here are an exception and require the\r\n      obbligato pedal.  Their number may amount to one hundred.  I myself\r\n      possess above seventy, and more survive elsewhere.(290) No other\r\n      Choral Preludes approach them in religious feeling, dignity, and\r\n      sublimity of expression.  I cannot notice them individually; they\r\n      are too numerous. Besides the larger, there is a great number of\r\n      shorter and easier ones, particularly useful for young players.\r\n      MSS. of them exist in considerable number.(291)\r\n      3. _Six Sonatas_, or Trios, for two manuals and an obbligato\r\n      pedal.(292) Bach wrote them for his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann,\r\n      whom they helped to become the great performer he was when I knew\r\n      him.  It is impossible to overpraise their beauty.  Bach composed\r\n      them when he was in the full vigour of his powers, and they may be\r\n      considered his chef d’oeuvre in this form.(293) He also wrote other\r\n      Organ Sonatas, the MSS. of which are in various collections.  They\r\n      are fine compositions, though they do not equal the Six in\r\n      merit.(294)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          IV. Instrumental Music\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few instruments for which Bach did not write.  In his day it was\r\nusual to play a Concerto or instrumental Solo during the Communion\r\noffice.(295) Bach composed many of these pieces himself, and always with a\r\nview to their improving the technique of the player.  Most of them are\r\nlost.  But two important works of another kind survive and to some extent\r\ncompensate us.  They are:\r\n\r\n      1. Six Solos for Violin, unaccompanied.(296)\r\n      2. Six Solos for Violoncello, unaccompanied.(297) The Violin Solos\r\n      have long been considered by the finest players to be the best\r\n      instructor for the instrument. The Violoncello Solos are equally\r\n      effective.(298)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              V. Vocal Music\r\n\r\n\r\n      1. Five complete sets of church Cantatas for the Sundays and\r\n      Festivals of the year.(299)\r\n      2. Five compositions for Holy Week, one of which is for double\r\n      chorus.(300)\r\n      3. Several Oratorios,(301) Masses,(302) a _Magnificat,_ settings of\r\n      the Sanctus,(303) compositions for birthdays and Saints’ Days,(304)\r\n      funerals,(305) marriages,(306) and some Italian Cantatas.(307)\r\n      4. Several Motets for single and double chorus.(308)\r\n\r\nMost of these works are now dispersed.  The Church Cantatas were divided\r\nbetween his elder sons after their composer’s death.  Wilhelm Friedemann\r\nhad the larger share because, being organist at Halle, he could make use\r\nof them.  Later, circumstances compelled him to part with them gradually.\r\nI know of no other collection of Bach’s larger choral works.  There exist,\r\nhowever, eight or ten Motets for double chorus, but they are dispersed in\r\nvarious hands.(309) In the collection bequeathed by the Princess Amalia of\r\nPrussia to the Joachimsthal Gymnasium at Berlin there are some of Bach’s\r\nvocal compositions.(310)  Their number is not considerable, but among them\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n      1. Twenty-one Church Cantatas.(311) In one of them, set to the\r\n      words, _Schlage doch, gewünschte Stunde,_(312) the composer\r\n      introduces a bell obbligato.  From that fact we may conclude that\r\n      the Cantata was not composed in the period of Bach’s maturity,(313)\r\n      for the use of bells is of doubtful taste.\r\n      2. Two Masses for five voices with instrumental accompaniment.(314)\r\n      3. A Mass for double chorus, the first being accompanied by Strings\r\n      and the second by wind instruments.(315)\r\n      4. A _Passion,_ for double Chorus,(316) the text by Picander.(317)\r\n      5. A _Sanctus,_ for four voices and instrumental accompaniment.(318)\r\n      6. A Motet, for four voices, _Aus tiefer Noth schrei ich zu\r\n      dir._(319)\r\n      7. A Motet for five voices, _Jesu, meine Freude._\r\n      8. Four Motets, for eight voices in double chorus:\r\n\r\n            (a) _Fürchte dich nicht, ich bin dei dir._\r\n            (b) _Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit auf._\r\n            (c) _Komm, Jesu, komm._\r\n            (d) _Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied._(320)\r\n\r\n      9. A detached four-part fugal chorus, _Nimm was dein ist, und gehe\r\n      hin._(321)\r\n      10. A bucolic Cantata, with Recitatives, Aria, Duet, and Chorus.  A\r\n      note is prefixed to it.(322)\r\n\r\n      On the MS. of the last-named Cantata and of the Mass for double\r\n      chorus (No. 3 supra) there is a note by Kirnberger analysing the\r\n      skill and merit of the compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.  BACH’S MANUSCRIPTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked more than once that Bach, throughout his life,\r\ndevoted much thought to the improvement of his compositions.  I have had\r\nfrequent occasion to compare the original and subsequent texts of his\r\nworks, and confess to have experienced both surprise and pleasure in\r\nobserving his care to improve whatever he thought faulty, to make good\r\nbetter, and better perfect.  Nothing is more instructive than a collation\r\nof this kind, whether to the experienced musician or the instructed\r\namateur.  I should like to see a supplement to the complete edition of\r\nBach’s works showing these variant readings.(323) The collation would be\r\nin the highest degree instructive, and to attempt it is as appropriate to\r\nthe works of the composer, a poet in sound, as to those of the poet in\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nIn Bach’s early texts he often repeats a phrase to other words with some\r\nmelodic variety, in a lower or even in the same octave.  In his riper\r\nexperience he could not tolerate such poverty of workmanship, and cut out\r\nthese passages remorselessly, without regard for the number and quality of\r\nthe persons who had approved them in their original state.  There occur to\r\nme two good examples of this, the C major and C sharp minor Preludes in\r\nthe first part of the _Well-tempered Clavier._ Bach revised them so\r\ndrastically as to cut them down by one-half, sacrificing passages that he\r\nthought redundant.(324)\r\n\r\nIn other places Bach tends to be over-concise; he expresses an idea, but\r\ndoes not fully develop it.  The best illustration that occurs to me is the\r\nD minor Prelude in the second part of the _Well-tempered Clavier._  I\r\npossess several texts of it.  In the oldest the first transposition of the\r\ntheme in the Bass and several other details essential to a complete\r\ndevelopment of the idea are wanting.  A second MS. gives the theme to the\r\nBass wherever the latter is in a key nearly related to that of the tonic.\r\nIn a third MS. these addenda are developed more fully and are joined more\r\nskilfully.  But melodic details are present of doubtful relevance to the\r\nrest of the composition.  In a fourth MS. these disappear or are amended,\r\nso that, as we have it, the Prelude stands as one of the most beautiful\r\nand least faulty in the _Well-tempered Clavier._ Many people, no doubt,\r\npreferred the movement in its original form.  But Bach was not a man to be\r\ninfluenced by approbation or criticism.  He went on correcting until he\r\nsatisfied himself.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the seventeenth century it was the fashion in\r\ninstrumental music to overload single notes with ornaments and add florid\r\nruns.  Lately it has become the fashion to do so in vocal music as well.\r\nThat Bach shared this disposition may be inferred from certain pieces that\r\nhe wrote in this style.  An instance is the Prelude in E minor in the\r\nfirst part of the _Well-tempered Clavier._  But he soon returned to his\r\nnatural better taste, and altered the movement to the form in which it is\r\nengraved.(325)\r\n\r\nEvery decade has its own style of melody, distinctive of itself and\r\nevanescent.  A composer must carefully avoid it if he hopes to be listened\r\nto by posterity.  In his young days even Bach ran upon this rock.  His\r\nearly compositions for the Organ, and the two-part _Inventions_ in their\r\noriginal form, are full of fiorituri such as the taste of his period\r\napproved.  His Organ compositions remain comparatively untouched, but the\r\n_Inventions_ he closely revised.  The public will soon be able to compare\r\nthem in their first and later forms, as the publishers, with admirable\r\nspirit, have resolved to discontinue the present edition and to send out\r\nto subscribers a revised one based on Bach’s corrected text.\r\n\r\nBach’s processes of revision so far mentioned, however, merely correct\r\nfaults of form, that is, diffuseness or incomplete development of a\r\nmusical thought.  But Bach employed other methods which are less easy to\r\ndescribe because they are more subtle.  He often rivets the style and\r\ncharacter of a piece by changing a single note, strictly correct\r\ngrammatically and yet disagreeable to an artist such as himself.  Even\r\ncommonplace passages he could convert into phrases of beauty by the\r\naddition or alteration of a single note.  Only the most sensitive taste\r\nand trained experience can decide in such cases, and Bach possessed both\r\nin the highest perfection.  He developed them to such a pitch, indeed,\r\nthat his brain eventually rejected any idea which, in all its properties\r\nand relations, did not accord inevitably and naturally with the whole\r\ncomposition.  Consequently his later works display such consistency of\r\nmerit that all of them seem to have been cast complete in a mould, so\r\nsmooth, facile and abundant is the flow of his rich fancy.  It is on the\r\nhighest summits of the art that harmony and melody find their ideal union,\r\nand as yet Bach dwells there in majestic isolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE GENIUS OF BACH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is surely unnecessary to ask whether that artist is a genius who, in\r\nevery form of his art, has produced masterpiece after masterpiece, of an\r\noriginality which sets them above the achievements of all other ages,\r\ndistinguished also by a wealth of originality and agreeableness that\r\nenslaves every hearer.  The most fertile fancy, invention inexhaustible, a\r\njudgment so nice as to reject intuitively every irrelevant and jarring\r\ndetail, unerring ingenuity in employing the most delicate and minute\r\nresources of his art, along with an unrivalled technique—these qualities,\r\nwhose expression demands the outpouring of a man’s whole soul, are the\r\nsignboards of genius.  The man who cannot find them in Bach’s music either\r\nis not acquainted with it at all or knows it imperfectly.  One needs to be\r\nsteeped in it thoroughly to appreciate the genius of its author.  For the\r\ngreater the work the closer study is demanded for its apprehension.  The\r\nbutterfly method, a sip here and there, is of little use.  But admirable\r\nas were the gifts Bach received from nature, he could never have become an\r\naccomplished genius had he not learned betimes to avoid the rocks on which\r\nmany artists, some of them perhaps not less gifted than he, too often\r\nfounder.  I will communicate to the reader some scattered thoughts on the\r\nsubject and conclude this essay with an indication of the characteristics\r\nof Bach’s genius.\r\n\r\nEven the largest natural gifts, coupled with the strongest propensity for\r\na particular art, offer no more than fruitful soil on which that art may\r\nthrive by patient cultivation.  Industry, the true begetter of every art\r\nand science, is an indispensable factor.  Not only does it enable genius\r\nto master technique, but it stimulates the critical and reflective\r\nfaculties also.  The very ease with which genius acquires and applies the\r\napparatus of musical composition frequently entices it to leap over root\r\nprinciples in its plunge into deeper waters, or to fly before its wings\r\nare grown.  In such a case, unless genius is guided back to neglected\r\nfundamentals and forced to build itself upon the great examples of the\r\npast, it will inevitably expend its treasure uselessly and never attain to\r\nits promised dimensions.  For it is an axiom, that real progress can never\r\nbe made, nor the highest perfection be attained, if the foundations are\r\ninsecure.  If arduous heights are to be achieved, the easier obstacles\r\nmust first be approached and overcome.  Guided by his own inexperience no\r\none ever can hope to become great.  He must profit by the practice and\r\nexample of others.\r\n\r\nBach did not founder on this rock.  His soaring genius attended an equally\r\nardent industry which incessantly impelled him, whenever he found his own\r\nequipment insufficient, to seek guidance from others.  Vivaldi and his\r\nConcertos were the first from whom he sought counsel.  From them he turned\r\nto the principal Organ and Clavier composers of the period.  Nothing is\r\nmore intellectually stimulating than counterpoint, and the composers Bach\r\nstudied were distinguished by their mastery of it, as their fugal writing\r\nattests.  Hence Bach’s diligent study and imitation of them pointed his\r\ntaste and imagination to perceive wherein himself was lacking and what\r\nsteps were needed to take him farther in his art.\r\n\r\nA second rock upon which genius often comes to grief is the public’s\r\nundiscriminating applause.  To be sure, I do not undervalue public\r\napproval or commend without reserve the remark of a Greek teacher to his\r\npupil, “You performed badly, otherwise the audience would not have\r\napplauded you.”  Yet it is none the less true that many artists are thrown\r\noff their balance by exaggerated and often unmerited plaudits,\r\nparticularly in their early careers before they have acquired\r\nself-discipline and sound judgment.  The public merely asks for what it\r\ncan understand, whereas the true artist ought to aim at an achievement\r\nwhich cannot be measured by popular standards.  How, then, can popular\r\napplause be reconciled with the true artist’s aspirations towards the\r\nideal?  Bach never sought applause, and held with Schiller:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Kannst du nicht allen gefallen durch deine That und dein\r\n    Kunstwerk,\r\n    Mach’ es wenigen recht; vielen gefallen ist schlimm.(326)\r\n\r\n\r\nLike every true artist, Bach worked to please himself in his own way,\r\nobeying the summons of his own genius, choosing his own subjects, and\r\nfinding satisfaction only in the approval of his own judgment.  He could\r\ncount on the applause of all who understood good music, and never failed\r\nto receive it.  Under what other conditions can sound works of art emerge?\r\nThe composer who debases his muse to the popular mood either lacks real\r\ngenius or, having it, abuses it.  For to catch the ear of the public is\r\nnot a difficult task and merely connotes an agreeable facility.  Composers\r\nof that class are like artisans who frankly fashion their goods to suit\r\ntheir market.  But Bach never condescended to such artifices.  The artist,\r\nin his judgment, is the dictator of public taste, not its slave.  If, as\r\noften happened, he was asked to write something simple for the Clavier he\r\nwould answer, “I will do what I can.”  He would choose an easy theme.  But\r\nwhen he began to develop it he always found so much to say that the piece\r\nsoon became anything but simple.  If his attention was drawn to the fact,\r\nhe would answer smilingly, “Practise it well and you will find it quite\r\neasy.  You have as many good fingers on each hand as I have.”  Nor was he\r\nprompted in this by mere contradictoriness, but exhibited the true artist\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, the artist temperament that led Bach to make the great\r\nand sublime his goal.  For that reason his music is not merely agreeable,\r\nlike other composers’, but transports us to the regions of the ideal.  It\r\ndoes not arrest our attention momentarily but grips us the stronger the\r\noftener we listen to it, so that after a thousand hearings its treasures\r\nare still unexhausted and yield fresh beauties to excite our wonder.  Even\r\nthe beginner who knows but the A B C of his art warms with pleasure when\r\nhe hears Bach’s music and can open his ear and heart to it.  It was the\r\ntrue artist spirit, too, that guided Bach to unite majesty and grandeur of\r\ndesign with meticulous care for detail and the most refined elegance,\r\ncharacteristics which we rather seek, perhaps, in works whose object is\r\nmerely to give pleasure.  Bach held strongly that if the strands are\r\nimperfect, the whole design is faulty.  His genius is sublime and\r\nimpressive, and he never condescends to be frivolous even when he touches\r\nthe lighter forms of art.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: it was the union of astounding genius and indefatigable\r\napplication that enabled Bach to widen at every point the domain of\r\nmusical expression.  His successors have failed to maintain the art at the\r\nlevel to which he raised it.  If Bach was more successful, if he was able\r\nto produce great work of convincing beauty and imperishable as a model for\r\nthose who came after him, we owe it as much to his application as to his\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThis man, the greatest orator-poet that ever addressed the world in the\r\nlanguage of music, was a German!  Let Germany be proud of him!  Yes, proud\r\nof him, but worthy of him too!\r\n\r\n                       [The Bach Statue at Leipzig]\r\n\r\n                        The Bach Statue at Leipzig\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.

THE CHURCH CANTATAS ARRANGED CHRONOLOGICALLY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have the statement of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach,(346) confirmed by\r\nForkel,(347) Bach’s earliest biographer, that his father composed five\r\nCantatas for every Sunday and Festival of the ecclesiastical year.\r\nConcerted music was sung at Leipzig annually on forty-three Sundays and\r\nsixteen week-days.(348) Bach therefore must have written at least 295\r\nCantatas.  Of this number he composed at least thirty before 1723.  Hence\r\napproximately 265 were written at Leipzig.  But Bach’s fertility does not\r\nappear to have outlived the year 1744.  We have reason, therefore, to\r\nconclude that the 265 Leipzig Cantatas were written in the course of\r\ntwenty-one years, that is, between 1723 and 1744.  To complete that number\r\nBach must have composed a new Cantata every month, a surprising but\r\ndemonstrable conclusion.\r\n\r\nOf the 295 Cantatas only 202 have come down to us, three of them in an\r\nincomplete state.(349) Of those written before 1723 the survivors are too\r\nscanty to indicate a rate of productivity.  But thereafter we have fuller\r\nmaterials for a calculation.  Bach, as Cantor, conducted his first Leipzig\r\nCantata on May 30, 1723, and in the following sixteen months produced\r\ntwenty-four Cantatas, at the rate of more than one a month.(350) Beginning\r\nat the New Year of 1725 he wrote eighteen Cantatas in nine months, some of\r\nwhich, however, may belong to the years 1726-7-8-9.  But even so, his\r\nmonthly average seems to have been maintained.  For 1730 we have, perhaps,\r\nten Cantatas.  For 1731 about twenty survive, of which half a dozen may\r\nbelong to 1732, a deduction which still preserves Bach’s steady average.\r\nIn 1735 he produced actually nineteen Cantatas between the New Year and\r\nthe following November, though not all of them are positively dated.\r\nThereafter his activity is less certainly measured.  But from 1736 till\r\nthe end of 1744 he composed fifty-three Cantatas, at the rate, that is, of\r\nat least six every year, without making allowance for Cantatas written and\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThere are few phenomena in the record of art more extraordinary than this\r\nunflagging cataract of inspiration, in which masterpiece followed\r\nmasterpiece with the monotonous periodicity of a Sunday sermon.  Its\r\nmusical significance has been presented with illuminating exegesis by more\r\nthan one commentator.  But its literary apparatus has captured little\r\nattention.  Yet Bach’s task must have been materially eased or aggravated\r\naccording as the supply of libretti was regular or infrequent, while the\r\nflow of his inspiration must have been governed by their quality.\r\nMoreover, the libretto was the medium through which he offered the homage\r\nof his art to the service of God.  The subject therefore deserves\r\nattention.  However trivial, measured against the immensities of Bach’s\r\ngenius, the study will at least provide a platform from which to\r\ncontemplate it.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the opinion may be hazarded that the provision of his weekly\r\nlibretti caused Bach greater anxiety than the setting of them to music, a\r\ntask which he accomplished with almost magical facility. It is true that\r\nfrom the early part of the 18th century cycles of Cantata texts for the\r\nChurch’s year were not infrequently published.  Bach was in more or less\r\nintimate touch with the authors of four, perhaps five, printed collections\r\nof the kind.  But he used them with surprising infrequency.  Neumeister’s\r\npublished cycles provided him with seven libretti,(351) Franck’s with\r\nsixteen,(352) Picander’s with ten,(353) Marianne von Ziegler’s with\r\nnine,(354) and Helbig’s with two.(355) He took three libretti from the\r\nBible,(356) and the hymn-book furnished him with eleven more.(357) But all\r\nthese published sources together only account for fifty-eight texts.  Bach\r\npossessed only one book that could assist his own efforts at\r\nauthorship—Paul Wagner’s eight-volumed Hymn-book—whence he took the\r\nstanzas which decorate his Cantatas like jewels in the rare settings he\r\ngave them.  It was, therefore, mainly upon writers with whom he was\r\nbrought into occasional or official contact that Bach depended for his\r\ntexts.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his career Bach was thrown upon his inexperience.  His\r\nearliest libretti, consequently, are tentative and transitory in their\r\nconstruction.  His first Cantata was written at Arnstadt for the Easter\r\nFestival of 1704.(358) The core of the libretto is a seven-stanzaed Easter\r\nsong by an unknown poet, eked out by two passages of Scripture, a\r\nExcitativo, Aria, and a verse of a congregational hymn.  The Aria and\r\nRecitativo are the only original numbers of the libretto, and there is\r\nlittle doubt that Bach wrote them himself.(359) But the whole libretto is\r\nstamped by his personality, and reveals the inveterate subjectivity of his\r\nreligion.  For, disregarding the general message of the Festival, the\r\nlibretto opens on the soul’s personal longing for immortality and closes\r\non its song of victory over death.  In construction it is archaic, a\r\nsurvival of traditions acquired from central and northern Germany through\r\nBach’s earlier residence at Lüneburg and intercourse with Hamburg.(360)\r\n\r\nThree years passed before Bach produced his next extant Cantata. In the\r\ninterval, on 29th June 1707, he resigned his Arnstadt appointment to\r\nbecome organist of the Church of St. Blasius at Mühlhausen.(361) Here,\r\nwithin the space of ten months, he produced three Cantatas, the uniform\r\ncharacter of whose libretti points to local and transitory influence upon\r\nthe composer.  The first of them,(362) written in August 1707, is a\r\nsetting of Psalm 130, with the addition of two hymn-stanzas.  The\r\nsecond(363) was performed on 4th February 1708, at the inauguration of the\r\nMühlhausen Town Council, and consists of Old Testament passages, a verse\r\nof a hymn, and three original stanzas.  The third,(364) a wedding Cantata,\r\nwas performed at Dornheim, near Arnstadt, on 5th June 1708, at the\r\nmarriage of Pastor Johann Lorenz Stauber to Frau Bach’s aunt, and is set\r\nto four verses of Psalm 115.\r\n\r\nWe can have little doubt regarding the authorship of these singularly\r\naustere libretti, so far removed in atmosphere from those of Bach’s\r\nsubsequent periods.  In fact, the clue is furnished by Bach himself.  A\r\nnote in his handwriting on the score of the first of the three Cantatas\r\n(No. 131) states that he composed it at the request of Georg Christian\r\nEilmar.  The man was a close friend, godfather of Bach’s eldest daughter,\r\nKatharina Dorothea (b. 1708), chief pastor of the Church of the Blessed\r\nVirgin, and Consistorial Assessor, at Mühlhausen.  He was, moreover, an\r\naggressive foe of Pietism, of which Mühlhausen was the citadel, and Bach’s\r\nminister, Frohne, the protagonist.  Indeed, the two men waged so public\r\nand wordy a warfare(365) that Bach’s social relations with the one and\r\nofficial connection with the other must have been rendered difficult.  To\r\nhis settled convictions regarding the fellowship of music and worship\r\nPietism offered Puritan opposition.  In fact, its lack of sympathy\r\neventually drove him from Mühlhausen, in hope, in his own words, “to\r\nrealise my views upon the right ordering of Church music without vexation\r\nfrom others.”(366) Eilmar, on the other hand, though he admitted the\r\naesthetic value of music, conspicuously lacked the warmth and emotionalism\r\nof Bach’s religious temperament.  To him undoubtedly we must attribute the\r\ncold austerity of the three Mühlhausen libretti and the suppression of the\r\npersonal note already sounded in Bach’s Arnstadt Cantata.  Nor did\r\nEilmar’s influence pass with Bach’s departure from Mühlhausen.(367) It is\r\nto be traced in the early libretti of the Weimar period.\r\n\r\nThe Weimar Cantatas are twenty-two in number, of which all but three were\r\nwritten subsequently to Bach’s appointment as Concertmeister early in\r\n1714. He had been organist to the Ducal Court of Weimar since June 1708, a\r\nposition which did not require him to compose for the Ducal Chapel. On the\r\nother hand, three Cantatas are attributed to the early Weimar years. But\r\nthey cannot be positively dated, and their libretti bear such clear traces\r\nof Eilmar’s influence that their composition may belong rather to the\r\nMühlhausen period.  Their texts display Eilmar’s preference for strictly\r\nBiblical material and a disinclination to employ secular forms.  The first\r\nof them(368) is a paraphrase of the Magnificat. The second(369) consists\r\nof four verses of Psalm 25, along with three simple rhymed stanzas which\r\nwe have no difficulty in attributing to Bach himself.  The third, _Gottes\r\nZeit ist die allerbeste Zeit_ (No. 106), was composed, Spitta\r\nconjectures,(370) for the funeral of Philipp Grossgebauer, Rector of\r\nWeimar School, in 1711.  But more recently, and more probably, Pirro(371)\r\nhas expressed the opinion that Bach wrote it for the funeral of his uncle,\r\nTobias Lammerhirt, who was buried at Erfurt in September 1707.  The theory\r\naccords with the suggestion that all three Cantatas belong to the\r\nMühlhausen period.  If so, it is probable that the libretto, a very\r\ningenious mosaic of Scripture texts, was written by Eilmar for the\r\noccasion.  It is the last in which we detect his influence.\r\n\r\nBach’s appointment as Ducal Concertmeister at Weimar can be placed between\r\n14th January and 19th March 1714(372) and, it is probable, was nearer the\r\nformer date.  He seems to have produced the first Cantata his new post\r\nrequired him to write on Sexagesima Sunday, which fell on 4th February in\r\nthat year.  From thence to the end of 1716 he produced nineteen Cantatas\r\nand collaborated with a writer whose libretti at length gave him a\r\nsatisfactory literary medium.\r\n\r\nThe new poet, Erdmann Neumeister, four of whose libretti Bach set to music\r\nimmediately after his appointment, and a fifth a year later,(373) was\r\nconsiderably Bach’s senior.(374) As far back as 1700 he had begun to write\r\na cycle of Cantata texts for the Ducal Chapel at Weissenfels, and pubushed\r\nit in 1704, with an explanatory Preface referred to later.(375) In 1708 he\r\nissued a second cycle for the Court of Rudolstadt, while in 1711 and 1714\r\nthird and fourth cycles were written for the Ducal Chapel at Eisenach.\r\nAll four cycles were reissued in 1716,(376) with the addition of a fifth\r\nand a Preface, which lauded Neumeister as “the first German to give sacred\r\nmusic its fitting position by introducing and perfecting the Church\r\nCantata.”(377)\r\n\r\nSpitta has dealt exhaustively(378) with the evolution and construction of\r\nthe Neumeister libretto.  It need only be remarked that it adapted a\r\nsecular or operatic apparatus to the service of religion, and that the\r\ninnovation, hateful to many, triumphed because of Neumeister’s delicate\r\nhandling of it.  He perfected the new form, however, in stages.  “A\r\nCantata,” he insisted in his 1704 Preface, “is simply a fragment of Opera\r\nmade up of Aria and Recitativo.”  But the restriction excluded from the\r\nCantata its most appropriate material.  In his 1708 cycle he found a place\r\nfor the chorus.  Finally, he admitted the Bible stanza and congregational\r\nhymn.  With their inclusion the Cantata libretto assumed the form familiar\r\nto us in Bach’s use.  It represents a combination of secular Opera and\r\necclesiastical Motet.  The free Arias and Recitativi are derived from the\r\none, the Bible stanzas and congregational hymns perpetuate the traditions\r\nof the other. Unity of design is stamped on the whole by its general\r\nsubordination to the Gospel for the Day.  Thus, at the moment when Bach\r\nwas about to devote his genius to the Cantata, Neumeister opportunely\r\nprovided him with a libretto singularly adapted to the end Bach had in\r\nview, and appropriate to the musical expression by which he proposed to\r\nsecure it.  He adhered to it almost to the end of his life, and found\r\nunfailing inspiration in Neumeister’s sincerity, delicacy, and uniformly\r\nreligious outlook.  Neumeister’s Arias, with a single exception,(379) are\r\nhymn-like in mood and metre.  His Recitativi are reflective and prayerful,\r\nrarely oratorical or pictorial, simple communings upon the Gospel themes\r\nwhich the libretto handles.(380)\r\n\r\nBach’s early introduction to Neumeister’s texts is explained by the close\r\nrelations between the Courts of Weimar and Eisenach, by his associations\r\nwith his own birthplace, and his intimacy with Georg Philipp Telemann,\r\nKapellmeister there, for whose use Neumeister’s third and fourth cycles\r\nwere written.(381) Bach set, in all, seven of the libretti—four from the\r\nfourth cycle,(382) one from the third,(383) and two from the first,(384)\r\none of which (No. 142) differs so much from the published version as to\r\nraise the question whether Bach did not receive it direct from Neumeister\r\nin the form in which he set it.(385)\r\n\r\nThat Bach should have set no more than seven of Neumeister’s texts(386) is\r\nstrange.  He shrank, perhaps, from appropriating libretti on which his\r\nfriend Telemann had a prior claim.(387) But the reason is found rather in\r\nthe fact that at Weimar Bach discovered in 1715 a local poet of first-rate\r\nability who, with perhaps but one exception, wrote the libretti of all the\r\nCantatas he composed during the last two years of his Weimar appointment.\r\n\r\nSalomo Franck, Bach’s new collaborator, was Curator of the Ducal Museum of\r\nCoins and Medals at Weimar.  He was twenty-six years older than Bach.  But\r\nSpitta’s conjecture,(388) that the two men were not acquainted, is hardly\r\ntenable.  Both resided in the same small provincial town, both were in the\r\nDuke’s service, and throughout 1715 and 1716 collaborated in at least ten\r\nCantatas performed in the Ducal Chapel.  Moreover, though the Preface of\r\nFranck’s first cycle is dated 4th June 1715,(389) Bach had already set one\r\nof its libretti for Easter of that year. A second cycle of texts, of which\r\nBach made little use,(390) was published by Franck in 1717.(391)\r\n\r\nSchweitzer, no doubt, is correct in his conclusion(392) that Bach was\r\ndrawn to Franck by his poetic insight, his mysticism, and innate feeling\r\nfor nature.  It must be remembered, too, that his libretti were, in some\r\ndegree, official.  On the other hand, Franck was Neumeister’s inferior in\r\nability to conceive a picture fit to express Bach’s larger moods, and on\r\noccasion could descend to sheer bathos.(393) But his texts have a rhythmic\r\nswing and melody which Bach found agreeable.  He set at least sixteen of\r\nthem, and returned to them even after he settled at Leipzig.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which terminated Bach’s service at Weimar are familiar,\r\nand need not be restated.  He received a new appointment at Cöthen on 1st\r\nAugust 1717, and took up his duties there, probably at Christmas, that\r\nyear.(394) His position was that of Capellmeister to the princely Court.\r\nHe never styles himself Court Organist,(395) and his duties severed him\r\nfor five years from the service of the Church, to which he had declared\r\nhis particular dedication in 1708.  The Cöthen Court was unpretentious.\r\nThe Prince was a Calvinist.  Figurate music was not permitted in the Court\r\nChapel, and its Organ was small and inadequate.  Hence Bach devoted\r\nhimself chiefly to chamber music, and only two genuine Church Cantatas\r\nbelong to this period of his career.  Both must have been written for\r\nperformance elsewhere, possibly in connection with Bach’s frequent Autumn\r\ntours as a performer.(396)\r\n\r\nFor both Cantatas Bach employed a librettist, otherwise little known,\r\nnamed Johann Friedrich Helbig, State Secretory to the Eisenach Court. In\r\nMarch 1720,(397) more than two years after Bach’s arrival at Cöthen,\r\nHelbig published a cycle of “Musical Texts on the Sunday and Saints’ Day\r\nGospels throughout the year,” for performance “in God’s honour by the\r\nPrince’s Kapelle at Eisenach.”(398) How they came into Bach’s hands we do\r\nnot know, but can readily conjecture.  They are indifferent poetry,\r\njudging them by the two specimens Bach made use of, and are uniform in\r\nconstruction.  The first movement invariably is a Chorus upon a text from\r\nthe Gospel for the Day, or a Scripture passage closely related to it.  Two\r\nArias separated by a Recitative follow. A Choral brings the libretto to an\r\nend.(399)\r\n\r\nThe first of the two Cantatas written to Helbig’s words was designed for\r\nthe Seventeenth Sunday after Trinity, which fell in 1720 on September\r\n22.(400) Spitta conjectures(401) that Bach intended it for performance at\r\nHamburg.  In fact, his wife’s death postponed Bach’s visit to that town\r\nuntil November, by which date the Sunday appropriate to the Cantata had\r\npassed. Spitta holds that the Cantata may have been performed, after all,\r\nduring the visit. Schweitzer is sceptical.(402) But Bach certainly\r\nexpended great pains upon the score.\r\n\r\nThe second Helbig Cantata(403) is for the Third Sunday in Advent, and the\r\ndate of it would appear to have been 1721.  It is one of the least\r\nagreeable of Bach’s works.  Spitta (404) declares it a juvenile\r\ncomposition hastily adapted to a new libretto. Schweitzer(405) expresses\r\nthe same opinion, and Sir Hubert Parry(406) finds the work “rather\r\ncommonplace.”  Its genuineness is discussed by Max Schreyer in the\r\n“Bach-Jahrbuch” for 1912, and more recently Rudolf Wustmann has insisted\r\nthat it does not bear the stamp of Bach’s genius.(407) If it actually was\r\ncomposed in 1721, its production must have coincided with Bach’s second\r\nmarriage on December 3 of that year.(408) In that case, his resort to old\r\nmaterial is explicable.\r\n\r\nOnly these two Cantatas were composed at Cöthen.  But later, at Leipzig,\r\ntwo others were manufactured out of secular material written there.(409)\r\nIt is unnecessary to refer to them, except to remark that in each case\r\nBach appears to have been the author of the new libretto.  In the first of\r\nthem(410) it is clear that he was handicapped by the frankly secular metre\r\nof the original stanzas.  The second of them,(411) originally a Birthday\r\nOde to Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen, is a masterly conversion into a\r\nWhit-Monday text which, assuming that Bach wrote it, puts his literary\r\nfacility beyond question.\r\n\r\nBach made the last move in his professional career on May 31, 1723, when\r\nhe was inducted Cantor of St. Thomas’ School at Leipzig, with particular\r\ncharge of the Churches of St. Thomas and St. Nicolas.  Here by far the\r\ngreater number of his Cantatas appeared, and 172 of them survive.  They\r\nare too numerous to be considered individually, and their classification\r\nis rendered difficult by the fact that the authorship of most of their\r\nlibretti is conjectural and not ascertained.  They fall, however, into two\r\nlarge categories, each of which exhibits characteristics of its own.\r\n\r\nThe dividing year, clearly but not arbitrarily, is 1734.  Before it and\r\nafter it Bach was aided by new writers.  But the earlier period\r\npre-eminently was one of experiment, out of which emerged the glorified\r\nhymn-libretto, or Choral Cantata, of Bach’s last years.  That it sprang,\r\nin some degree, from the difficulty of finding good original texts in\r\nsufficient number may be granted.  That it was adopted as an avenue of\r\nescape from Picander’s coarser work is a conjecture based, apparently,\r\nupon a prevalent exaggeration of Bach’s dependence on that writer.  The\r\nfundamental reason which led Bach to the hymn-libretto undoubtedly was the\r\nfact that it most closely fulfilled the ideals which informed his work.\r\n\r\nThe first Cantata performed during Bach’s Cantorship(412) reveals a new\r\nauthor, whose assistance, if the conclusion is well grounded, was at\r\nBach’s disposal throughout the whole of the earlier Leipzig period.\r\nSpitta’s keen insight failed him in this instance.  He betrays no\r\nrecognition of the new writer, and occasionally(413) attributes his\r\nlibretti to Picander.  The credit of the discovery belongs to Rudolf\r\nWustmann, though he fails to work it out to its fullest conclusions.(414)\r\n\r\nNo one can read the early Leipzig libretti without being struck by the\r\nnumber of them that are not only uniform in structure, but similar in tone\r\nand point.  They all begin with a Bible text, chosen frequently, but not\r\ninvariably, from the Gospel for the Day.  Every one of them ends with a\r\nhymn-stanza.  Their Arias, with hardly an exception,(415) are written in\r\nwhat, compared with Picander’s rollicking dactyls, may be held\r\nhymn-metres.  Their Recitativi, almost invariably, are didactic or\r\nexegetical.(416) They do not display the vapid rhetoric of Picander.  Nor\r\ndo they express the reflective or prayerful mood that reveals Bach.  They\r\nare essentially expositive and, it is noticeable, are studded with direct\r\nor veiled references to Bible passages which expand or enforce the lesson\r\nof the initial text.  In a word, they suggest the work of a preacher\r\ncasting his sermon notes into lyrical form, an impression which is\r\nstrengthened by the fact that the libretto invariably opens with a\r\nScripture passage and frequently blends the Gospel and Epistle for the Day\r\nin one harmonious teaching.  Spitta detected this characteristic.  But he\r\nfailed to follow up the clue.  He speaks(417) of one of these texts(418)\r\nas a “moralising homily,” a phrase concisely appropriate to them all.\r\nMoreover, a remark of his,(419) pointing the significance of the\r\ngod-parents chosen by Bach for his children—Eilmar, for instance—as\r\nrevealing Bach’s intimate associates at the moment, affords another clue\r\nto the personality of the new writer.\r\n\r\nAmong the clergy of St. Thomas’ during Bach’s Cantorate were two men,\r\nfather and son, each of whom bore the name Christian Weiss.  The elder was\r\nPastor of the Church from 1714 till his death in 1737.  He was a cultured\r\nman, in touch with the University, and possibly formed a link between it\r\nand Bach, to whom he showed greater cordiality than the Cantor received\r\nfrom other clerical colleagues.  In 1732 his daughter, Dorothea Sophia\r\nstood godmother to Bach’s son, Johann Christoph Friedrich, afterwards\r\nfamous as the “Bückeburg Bach.”(420) In 1737 his son stood sponsor to\r\nBach’s daughter, Johanna Caroline.(421) Nor can it be altogether without\r\nsignificance that the names Dorothea, Sophia, Christian, are borne by\r\nothers of Bach’s children by his second marriage.  There is sufficient\r\nevidence, therefore, that Bach’s relations with the elder Weiss were\r\nintimate enough to support a literary partnership.  Moreover,\r\ncircumstances lend weight to the inference.  For some years before Bach’s\r\narrival in Leipzig, Weiss suffered from an affection of the throat which\r\nkept him from the pulpit.  But, during the first year of Bach’s Cantorate,\r\nhe was able to resume his preaching.  If he was, in fact, the author of\r\nthe libretti, we can have little difficulty in concluding that they and\r\nhis sermons were built on the same text.\r\n\r\nSo far as they can be identified—the attempt is somewhat speculative—Weiss\r\nprovided Bach with at least thirty-three libretti.  He set five of them in\r\n1723, three in 1724, nine in or about 1725, one in 1727, two in 1730, six\r\nin 1731, three in 1732, and four in the later Leipzig period.(422)\r\nFourteen others bear a constructional resemblance to Weiss’s texts,(423)\r\nbut their character refers them rather to Bach or Picander.  Even so, if\r\nwe do not exaggerate his activity, Weiss seems to have written at least\r\none-sixth of the Leipzig libretti and more than a quarter of those of the\r\nearlier period.  Without a doubt he eased a difficult situation in Bach’s\r\nexperience before his regular association with Picander began.\r\n\r\nApart from their revelation of Christian Weiss, the libretti of Bach’s\r\nfirst year at Leipzig do not call for comment.  Franck and Neumeister\r\nappear among them, and we trace Bach’s hand in nine.(424) But at Easter,\r\n1724, he broke new ground with a libretto whence developed the Cantata\r\nform of his latest period.\r\n\r\nThe Cantata for Easter Day 1724,(425) is Bach’s earliest setting of an\r\nentire congregational hymn.  Spitta suggests(426) that he felt the fitness\r\nof giving the libretto an antique character to match the hymn’s melody.\r\nHowever that may be, Bach would appear already to have been groping\r\ntowards the Choral Cantata of the late ’30’s.  And though he did not\r\nrepeat the experiment until the Easter of 1731,(427) he treated three\r\nhymn-libretti in the interval in a manner which shows him already to have\r\nworked out the essentials of the Choral Cantata form.(428)\r\n\r\nAnother landmark meets us a year and a half after the Easter experiment.\r\nOn September 23, 1725(?)—the Seventeenth Sunday after Trinity—Bach\r\nproduced a Cantata(429) whose Arias are set to words which had appeared in\r\nprint in the preceding year.  Their author was a hack writer named\r\nChristian Friedrich Henrici, or, as he preferred to style himself,\r\nPicander.  His hand probably is also traced in the libretto used by Bach\r\non the preceding Sunday(430) and again in that for Sexagesima in the same\r\nyear.(431) But the evidence is only inferential.  That he collaborated\r\nwith Bach on September 23, 1725 (?), is incontestable, and the work\r\ndefines the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership.\r\n\r\nSpitta,(432) who tells us all that is known of Picander, has sufficiently\r\nexposed his superficial literary facility.  He commenced to write sacred\r\npoetry in 1724, and on Advent Sunday of that year began a cycle of\r\n“Profitable Thoughts,” so he termed them, upon the Sunday and Saints’ Day\r\nGospels.  He published them in 1725, when the cycle was complete.(433)\r\nThree years later he issued a cycle of Cantata texts for 1728-29 in the\r\nNeumeister form.(434) That he intended them for Bach’s use is apparent in\r\nthe fact that he expressly dedicated them to the service of “our\r\nincomparable Capellmeister.”  But Bach made the sparest use of them and of\r\nthe earlier “Profitable Thoughts” alike.  From the latter he took not one\r\nlibretto.(435) Of the 1728-29 cycle he used only eight texts.(436) One\r\nmore libretto can be referred to Picander’s later publications,(437) and\r\nof six others we can be sure that they are based upon his texts.(438) In\r\nother words, of the original libretti of the Leipzig period we can trace\r\nPicander’s hand positively in no more than fifteen.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to emphasise this point. For Spitta(439) has stated\r\npositively that Picander wrote “most” of the Leipzig libretti, and his\r\nopinion has been generally accepted.  But its correctness may be\r\ncontested.  It is suspicious, to begin with, that Picander never published\r\nthe texts which Spitta asserts him to have poured out in such profusion.\r\n“He placed no value,” Spitta answers readily, “on these manufactured\r\ncompositions, put together hastily to please his friend.”  But the\r\nargument cannot stand.  Why should Picander have thought less of libretti\r\nactually used by his “incomparable Capellmeister” than of those published\r\nfor and rejected by him?—for Spitta does not venture to declare that as\r\nliterature the rejected were superior to the accepted texts.  If out of a\r\npublished cycle of libretti expressly written for him Bach chose only\r\neight texts, are Picander’s “manufactured compositions,” as Spitta calls\r\nthem, likely to have attracted him to a greater degree?  We can detect his\r\nhand perhaps in six Cantatas(440) besides those already mentioned, and\r\nBach relied on him exclusively for his secular texts.  One concludes, none\r\nthe less, that Bach rarely accepted an original Cantata libretto from\r\nPicander, and employed him chiefly on the Choral Cantatas of his latest\r\nperiod.  Excluding them, and adding the probable to the actual original\r\nPicander texts, they total only twenty-one, a fraction inadequate to\r\nsupport Spitta’s sweeping statement.\r\n\r\nFrom the advent of Picander in 1725, to the end of the first Leipzig\r\nperiod nine years later, Bach does not seem to have gone outside the\r\ncircle of familial authors for his regular Cantata texts.  On October 17,\r\n1727, however, he produced a funeral Cantata, or “Trauer-Musik,” in memory\r\nof the late Queen of Poland, the libretto of which was written by\r\nProfessor J. C. Gottsched.  The partnership, in fact, was accidental: the\r\nlibretto was supplied to Bach with the commission to set it to music, and,\r\nso far as is known, Gottsched and he did not collaborate again.\r\n\r\nSo, reviewing Bach’s activities during his first eleven years at Leipzig,\r\nwe find that of the hundred libretti set by him to music Christian Weiss\r\nheads the list as the presumed author of twenty-nine.  Bach follows him\r\nwith eighteen.(441) Picander’s hand appears in fifteen, Franck’s in\r\neight,(442) Neumeister’s and Gottsched’s in one each.  Fifteen libretti\r\nare congregational hymns in their original or paraphrased form.  One is\r\nthe _Gloria in Excelsis_ of the B minor Mass adapted as a Christmas\r\nCantata (No. 190).  Twelve are by authors not identified.\r\n\r\nPassing to the later Leipzig period, seventy-two surviving Cantatas are\r\nattributed to the years 1735-50.  They reveal one, perhaps two, new\r\nwriters.  The first of them, Marianne von Ziegler, was identified by\r\nSpitta in 1892.  She was the widow of an officer, resident in Leipzig, a\r\ncultured woman, in touch with University life, her house a salon for music\r\nand musicians.(443) There is no reason to suppose Bach to have been of her\r\ncircle, or that he was acquainted with her literary gifts.  Indeed the\r\ncontrary is to be inferred from the fact that, though she published her\r\npoems in 1728,(444) he does not seem to have known them until seven years\r\nlater, when he used them for nine consecutive Sundays and Festivals in\r\n1735, beginning on the Third Sunday after Easter, and ending on Trinity\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these nine libretti, both Spitta(445)and Schweitzer(446)\r\nattribute to her the text of Bach’s Cantata for the Second Sunday after\r\nEaster in the same year.(447) It is uniform in construction with the\r\nauthentic nine, but is not among the authoress’s published works.\r\nWustmann(448) finds the tone of the libretto less ardent and its rhythm\r\nrougher than those published under her name.  Admitting the soundness of\r\nWustmann’s criticism, one hazards the opinion that the challenged text was\r\nwritten at the period when Bach set it, namely, in 1735, eight years after\r\nthe poetess published her earlier texts.  The difference of time may\r\naccount for the difference of texture to which Wustmann draws attention,\r\nbut leaves undecided the question whether Bach was drawn to the earlier\r\nthrough the later and unpublished texts or vice versa.  It is quite\r\nprobable that he set other libretti by the same writer, though\r\nSchweitzer’s(449) attribution to her of a second text for Ascension Day,\r\n1735, must be rejected.(450)\r\n\r\nIt is worth noticing, since it certainly reveals Bach’s preference, that\r\nMarianne von Ziegler’s libretti are constructed almost invariably in the\r\nWeiss form.  Every one of them but three(451) opens with a Bible passage,\r\ninvariably taken from St. John’s Gospel, which provides the Gospel for the\r\nDay from the First Sunday after Easter down to Trinity Sunday, excepting\r\nAscension Day.  All but one (No. 68) of the libretti conclude with a\r\nChoral, and their Arias are hymn-like in metre.  The tone of them,\r\nhowever, is warmer, more personal, less didactic than the Weiss texts.\r\nThat Bach regarded them with particular favour is apparent in the\r\ncircumstance that he took the trouble to revise all but one of them.(452)\r\nThat they stirred his genius deeply is visible in the settings he gave\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter 1735 the chronology of the Cantatas is not certainly ascertained.\r\nOf those that fall after the Ziegler year, as we may term it, the majority\r\ncan only be dated approximately as circa 1740, that is, anywhere between\r\n1735 and 1744.  Nor, except rarely, can we detect in their libretti the\r\nwork of those on whom Bach elsewhere relied.  Weiss, who died late in\r\n1737, is only an occasional contributor.  The texts of this period, in\r\nfact, are the outcome of Bach’s own experiments in libretto form.\r\nThirty-three of them are Choral Cantatas, whose evolution it remains to\r\ntrace concisely.\r\n\r\nThat Bach should have turned to Lutheran hymnody, chiefly of the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries, and that the Cantatas built upon it should be his\r\nmost perfect religious work is not surprising.  The hymns and their\r\nmelodies were the foundations upon which the temple of German\r\nProtestantism had been reared.  They appealed vividly and powerfully to\r\nBach’s spiritual nature, and profoundly influenced his musical utterance.\r\nHis whole career, as Sir Hubert Parry points out,(453) was an effort to\r\nwiden his means for self-expression.  And the Choral Cantata, in effect,\r\nwas the reconciliation or blending of this self-discipline.  It was the\r\nsupreme achievement of Bach’s genius to assert the faith and idealism of\r\nLutheran hymnody with the fullest resources of his technique.\r\n\r\nIt is not our task to consider the hymn libretto in its relation to the\r\nstructure of Bach’s latest Cantatas.  Necessarily it tied him to a\r\nstereotyped design, which he clung to with greater persistency because it\r\nexactly fulfilled his devotional purpose.  But experience compelled him,\r\nafter a brief trial, to discard the simple hymn libretto.  In the earlier\r\nLeipzig years as many as eight Choral Cantatas(454) are set to the\r\nunaltered text of a congregational hymn.  In the later Leipzig period only\r\ntwo(455) libretti are of that character.  Bach, in fact, soon realised\r\nthat, while the unaltered hymn-stanza, with its uniform metre and balanced\r\nrhyme, was appropriate to the simple Choral or elaborate Fantasia, it was\r\nunmalleable for use as an Aria or Recitative.  Hence, retaining the\r\nunaltered Hymn-stanza for the musical movements congruous to it, he was\r\nled to paraphrase, in free madrigal form, those stanzas which he selected\r\nfor the Arias and Recitativi.\r\n\r\nAs early as September 16, 1725,(456) Bach was moving towards this\r\nsolution.  And it is significant that Picander’s hand is visible in the\r\nlibretto.  The next example(457) occurs three years later, and again\r\nreveals Picander’s authorship.  Two other instances also occur in the\r\nearly Leipzig period.(458) To that point, however, it is clear that Bach\r\nwas not satisfied as to the most effective treatment of the hymn-libretto.\r\nBut in the second Leipzig period, after his collaboration with Marianne\r\nvon Ziegler, he arrived at and remained constant to a uniform design.  Of\r\nthe thirty-nine Choral Cantatas of the whole period only two exhibit the\r\nearlier form.  Of all the others the libretto consists partly of unaltered\r\nhymn-stanzas—invariably used for the first and last movements, and\r\noccasionally elsewhere—but chiefly of paraphrased stanzas of the hymn,\r\nwhose accustomed melody, wherever else it may be introduced, is associated\r\ninvariably with the hymn when the text is used in its unaltered form.  We,\r\nto whom both words and melody are too frequently unfamiliar, may view the\r\nperfections of the Choral Cantata with some detachment.  But Bach’s\r\naudience listened to hymns and tunes which were in the heart of every\r\nhearer and a common possession of them all.  The appeal of his message was\r\nthe more arresting because it spoke as directly to himself as to those he\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nIt would be satisfactory and interesting to point positively to Bach’s own\r\nhandiwork in these libretti, of which he set fifty-four in the period\r\n1724-44.  Unfortunately it is impossible to do so, except, perhaps, in a\r\nsingle case,(459) where we can reasonably infer that the libretto is his.\r\nOf the rest, one is by Franck.(460) In eighteen of them the hand of\r\nPicander is more or less patent.(461) Nineteen(462) we can only venture to\r\nmark “anonymous,” though Picander is probably present in most of them.\r\nTen are unaltered congregational hymns.(463) There remain, however,\r\nfive(464) in which, perhaps, we detect another, and the last, of Bach’s\r\nliterary helpers.\r\n\r\nWustmann draws attention(465) to the libretto of Cantata No. 38, a\r\nparaphrase of Luther’s Psalm 130.  He finds in it, and reasonably, an\r\nexpression of “Jesus religion” very alien to Picander’s muse, and suggests\r\nthe younger Christian Weiss as the author of it.  Like his father, he was\r\nBach’s colleague, the godfather of his daughter, and undoubtedly on terms\r\nof close friendship with him.  But if he wrote the libretto of Cantata No.\r\n38, probably it is not the only one.  The same note rings in four more of\r\nthe Choral Cantatas,(466) which may be attributed tentatively to Weiss,\r\nthough their ascription to Bach would be equally congruous.\r\n\r\nReturning, however, to the seventy-two libretti of the later Leipzig\r\nperiod we reach this result: More than half of them (thirty-nine) are\r\ncongregational hymns, all but two of which are of the paraphrased type in\r\nwhich we detect the work of Picander, Bach himself, and perhaps the\r\nyounger Weiss.  Of the remaining thirty-three original libretti Marianne\r\nvon Ziegler heads the list with nine, and perhaps ten.(467)  Bach follows\r\nwith a problematical six,(468) Picander with five,(469) the elder Weiss\r\nwith four,(470) Neumeister with one.(471) One text is taken from the\r\nBible.(472) Another consists of a single stanza of a hymn by Martin\r\nBehm.(473) Five are by authors unknown or undetected.(474)\r\n\r\nBut, as was said at the outset, the attribution of particular libretti to\r\nindividual writers is conjectural, except in comparatively few cases.\r\nYet, unsatisfying as it is, this guess-work reveals with approximate\r\ncorrectness the extent to which Bach drew upon his own and other people’s\r\nabilities for the texts he needed.  Summarising our conclusions, we\r\ndiscover that about one-quarter (fifty-four) of the 202 libretti set by\r\nBach between the years 1704 and 1744 were provided by the hymn-book.  It\r\nis shown elsewhere(475) that all but eleven of them are taken from Paul\r\nWagner’s volumes.  The elder Weiss comes next with thirty-three libretti.\r\nBach follows with thirty, Salomo Franck with twenty-one, Picander with\r\ntwenty (exclusive of his arrangements of Choral Cantata texts).  Marianne\r\nvon Ziegler contributes ten, Neumeister seven, Eilmar and Helbig two each,\r\nGottsched and Martin Behm one each.  Three libretti are taken from the\r\nBible or Church liturgy.  Eighteen remain anonymous.\r\n\r\nThe literary qualities of the libretti are not under discussion here.\r\nThey have a characteristic, however, on which one cannot forbear from\r\nremarking.  Indifferent literature as, for the most part, they\r\nare—children of their period and blemished with its imperfections—they\r\nenshrine an extraordinarily interesting anthology of the religious poetry\r\nof the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries.  They expose the\r\nevangelical thought of Germany from the age of Luther to that of Bach, and\r\nare particularly rich in the lyrical fervour of the Reformation itself.\r\nOf the seventy-seven hymn-writers whom Bach includes in his collection, so\r\nmany as forty-four belong to the sixteenth century.  Only thirteen of them\r\ntouch Bach’s own period.  And a similar bias to the Reformation epoch is\r\nobservable in his choice of the tunes of the Chorals, which are absent\r\nfrom only twenty-one of the Cantatas.  By far the greater number of them\r\nare coeval with the hymns themselves; that is, they date from the\r\nReformation and behind it.\r\n\r\nHere clearly is the source of Bach’s inspiration, the master-key of his\r\nart.  He touches Luther, is in a sense his complement, his art builded on\r\nthe foundations Luther laid, consecrated to the ends Luther vindicated,\r\ninspired by a dedication of himself to God’s service not less exalted—a\r\ngreat artist, a great Protestant, a great man.(476)\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Cantatas distinguished by an asterisk (*) are for Soli voices only\r\n(S.A.T.B. unless the particular voices are stated); those marked (†)\r\ninclude, in addtion, simple four-part Chorals: the rest contain concerted\r\nChoruses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            (1) COMPOSED AT ARNSTADT (see also Nos. 150, 189.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           (2) COMPOSED AT MÜLHAUSEN (see also Nos. 150, 189.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    (3) COMPOSED AT WEIMAR.

THE BACHGESELLSCHAFT EDITIONS OF BACH’S WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bachgesellschaft was founded on December 15, 1850, issued its first\r\nvolume in 1851, and was dissolved on January 27, 1900, upon the\r\npublication of its sixtieth and concluding volume.  The Society had\r\nfulfilled its fundamental purpose—the publication of Bach’s works—and on\r\nthe very date of its dissolution the Neue Bachgesellschaft was founded\r\nwith the object of popularising Bach’s music by publishing it in\r\npracticable form and by holding Bach Festivals.  A secondary object, the\r\nfoundation of a Bach Museum at Eisenach, in the house in which Bach was\r\nborn, already has been achieved.  Bach Festivals have been held at regular\r\nintervals—at Berlin in 1901, Leipzig in 1904, Eisenach—in connection with\r\nthe opening of the Museum—in 1907, at Chemnitz in 1908, Duisburg in 1910,\r\nBreslau in 1912, Vienna in 1914.  The publications of the new Society\r\nnecessarily are unimportant by the side of those of its predecessor.  It\r\nhas, however, brought to light and published a Cantata overlooked by the\r\nold Bachgesellschaft.  (See New B.G. XIII. (2).)\r\n\r\nThe publications of both Societies are quoted here by their year of\r\nissue—I., II., III., and so forth.  When more than one volume has been\r\npublished in a single year they are differentiated thus: XV.(1), XV.(2).\r\nWhen a volume appeared upon a date subsequent to the Vereinsjahr it bears,\r\nthe date of the Preface is indicated in a bracket, e.g. 1872[1876].\r\n\r\nThe editorial work of the original Bachgesellschaft was undertaken, in\r\nunequal proportions, by ten editors during fifty years.  Of the Society’s\r\nsixty volumes three were edited by Moritz Hauptmann (1851-58), one by Carl\r\nF. Becker (1853), two by Julius Rietz (1854-56), twenty-seven by Wilhelm\r\nRust (1855-81), one by Franz Kroll (1866), eleven by Alfred Dörffel\r\n(1876-98), six by Paul Graf Waldersee (1881-94), five by Ernst Naumann\r\n(1886-94), two by Franz Wüllner (1887-92), and two by Hermann Kretzschmar\r\n(1895-1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 (A) PUBLICATIONS OF THE BACHGESELLSCHAFT\r\n\r\n\r\n   I. 1851.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BACH LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list does not include magazine articles or technical works.\r\nA comprehensive bibliography, compiled by Max Schneider, will be found in\r\nthe Bach-Jahrbuch for 1905 and 1910.  Shorter lists are in C. F. Abdy\r\nWilliams’ _Bach_ (1900) and Andre Pirro’s _J.-S. Bach_ (1906).  Titles\r\nwithin square brackets in the following list are inserted upon the\r\nauthority of the _Bach-Jahrbuch,_ but are not discoverable in the annual\r\nBook Catalogues.  Since the absence of an Italian section may be remarked,\r\nit should be said that the _Catalogo generate della Libreria Italiana,\r\n1847-1899_ (published in 1910) contains no reference to Bach.  Nor does\r\nthe Supplement of 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I. Germany\r\n\r\n\r\n      Johann Christoph W. Kühnau, _Die blinden Tonküstler._ Berlin. 1810.\r\n      J. E.

See infra, p. 280.\r\n\r\n    3 In _The News_ of January 4, 1829, he is described as the second son\r\n      of the late John Stephenson of Great Ormonde Street, Queen Square,\r\n      whom he had succeeded in the partnership of the firm.  His wife was\r\n      dead, and of his eight children the eldest was also in the Bank.\r\n\r\n    4 Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach, third son of Johann Sebastian Bach, b.\r\n      1714; Kammermusikus to Frederick the Great of Prussia (1746),\r\n      Kapellmeister at Hamburg (1768); d. 1788.\r\n\r\n    5 Johann Friedrich Agricola, of Dobitsch, b. 1720; studied composition\r\n      with Bach at Leipzig; Court Composer (1751) and, after Carl Heinrich\r\n      Graun’s death (1759), Kapellmeister to Frederick the Great of\r\n      Prussia; d. 1774. See Spitta, _Johann Sebastian Bach,_ iii. 243 ff.\r\n\r\n    6 Lorenz Christoph Mizler (1711-78), a pupil of Bach, founded at\r\n      Leipzig in 1738 the “Sozietat der musikalischen Wissenschaften,” of\r\n      which Bach and Handel were members.  Mizler’s journal, the\r\n      _Neueröffneter Musikalischer Bibliothek,_ was its organ.  It\r\n      appeared from 1736 to 1754.  In Part I. of vol. iv. (1754) C. P. E.\r\n      Bach and Agricola collaborated in the obituary notice, or\r\n      “Nekrolog,” which is almost the earliest literary authority for\r\n      Bach’s life.  It covered less than twenty pages.  (See Schweitzer,\r\n      _J. S. Bach_ (trans. Ernest Newman), i. 189 ff. and Spitta, i.\r\n      Pref.)  Agricola’s association with Bach’s son in the preparation of\r\n      the obituary notice is explained by the fact that for the last ten\r\n      years of Sebastian’s life Agricola was in closer relations with him\r\n      than Carl Philipp Emmanuel, who no longer was resident in Leipzig.\r\n\r\n    7 Forkel’s _Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik_ (2 vols. 1788-1801) had\r\n      only come down to the sixteenth century when its author diverted his\r\n      pen to a biography of Bach.\r\n\r\n    8 The firm of Hoffmeister and Kühnel was founded at Leipzig in 1800 by\r\n      Franz Anton Hoffmeister, who started, in 1801, a subscription for\r\n      the publication of Bach’s works, to which Forkel alludes.  The\r\n      scheme failed to mature, and its accomplishment was reserved to C.\r\n      F. Peters, who purchased Hoffmeister’s “Bureau de Musique” in 1814.\r\n      See articles on Hoffmeister and Peters in Grove’s _Dictionary._\r\n\r\n    9 Though Bach never ventured upon such tours as Mozart or Berlioz, for\r\n      instance, undertook, he loved travelling, and his artistic journeys\r\n      made him famous throughout Germany, at least as an organist.  Forkel\r\n      himself describes (infra, pp. 19, 23) his notable visits to the\r\n      Courts of Berlin and Dresden.\r\n\r\n   10 In 1802, it must be remembered, not a note of Bach’s concerted\r\n      Church music was in print except the tunes he wrote for Schemelli’s\r\n      Hymn-book (1736) and the vocal parts of an early Cantata (No. 71).\r\n      Of his instrumental works engraved by 1802 Forkel gives a list\r\n      infra, p. 137.  It was hardly until the foundation of the\r\n      Bachgesellschaft in 1850, to celebrate the centenary of Bach’s\r\n      death, that the systematic publication of his concerted Church music\r\n      began.  Before that date, however, Peters of Leipzig had taken in\r\n      hand the abandoned scheme of Hoffmeister and Kühnel, to which Forkel\r\n      alludes, and in which he participated.\r\n\r\n   11 It is notable that Forkel makes no mention of Haydn, Mozart, or\r\n      Handel, whose English domicile had divorced him from Germany’s\r\n      service.  Forkel’s pessimism is the more curious, seeing that\r\n      Beethoven was already thirty years old, and that Mozart in 1786,\r\n      after giving him a subject to extemporise upon, had remarked,\r\n      “Listen to that young man; he will some day make a noise in the\r\n      world” (Holmes, _Life of Mozart,_ Dent’s ed., p. 223).  Forkel, in\r\n      fact, appreciated neither Mozart nor Beethoven and thoroughly\r\n      detested Gluck.\r\n\r\n   12 As has been pointed out in the Introduction, Forkel stood almost\r\n      alone in 1802 in his opinion of Bach’s pre-eminence.  Even Beethoven\r\n      placed Bach after Handel and Mozart, but knew little of his music on\r\n      which to found a decision.\r\n\r\n   13 The anonymous article in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek,_ to\r\n      which Forkel alludes, deals with Bach’s Clavier and Organ works and\r\n      upon them asserts Bach’s superiority over Handel.  The judgment was\r\n      unusual.  Bach’s fame was gravely prejudiced by German\r\n      Handel-worship, which the first performance of the _Messiah_ at\r\n      Leipzig in 1786 stimulated.  Johann Adam Hiller, Bach’s third\r\n      successor in the Cantorate of St. Thomas’, was largely responsible.\r\n      He neglected, and even belittled, the treasures of Bach’s art which\r\n      the library of St. Thomas’ contained.

The latter was born\r\n      in 1710, and after holding Organistships at Halle and Dresden, died\r\n      at Berlin in 1784, leaving his widow and daughter in great poverty.\r\n      The former received a grant from the receipts of the _Messiah_\r\n      performance alluded to in note 1, supra.  A man of brilliant musical\r\n      attainments, Wilhelm Friedemann’s character was dissolute and\r\n      unsteady. See Schweitzer, i. 146 ff.\r\n\r\n   16 Two letters written by C. P. E. Bach to Forkel in 1775, conveying a\r\n      good deal of information reproduced by Forkel in this monograph, are\r\n      printed in facsimile by Dr. Max Schneider in his _Bach-Urkunden_\r\n      (N.B.G., XVII. (3)).\r\n\r\n   17 Forkel’s statement is entitled to respect. On the other hand there\r\n      is nothing in the recorded careers of either of Bach’s sons that\r\n      bears him out on this point. Schweitzer (i. 229) endorses Elinor’s\r\n      judgment: “Bach’s sons were the children of their epoch, and never\r\n      understood their father; it was only from piety that they looked at\r\n      him with childlike admiration.” Dr. Charles Burney spent several\r\n      days with Carl Philipp Emmanuel at Hamburg in 1772, but during the\r\n      whole time the son never played to him a note of his father’s music.\r\n\r\n   18 i.e. Hoffmeister and Kühnel’s project.\r\n\r\n   19 The accuracy of this statement is apparent from the Genealogy\r\n      appended to this volume.  Bach’s sons represented the sixth\r\n      generation from Veit Bach, the sixteenth century ancestor of the\r\n      family. Veit himself was not a professional musician; one of his\r\n      sons was a Spielmann; thereafter for the next 150 years all but\r\n      seven of his descendants, whose professions are known, were\r\n      Organists or Cantors or Town Musicians.  Many of them, moreover,\r\n      were men of the highest attainments in their profession.\r\n\r\n   20 He took his name from St. Vitus (Guy), patron saint of the church of\r\n      Wechmar, a fact which sufficiently disproves Forkel’s statement that\r\n      his original domicile was in Hungary.  The Bachs were settled in\r\n      Wechmar as early as circ. 1520.  Veit migrated thence to Hungary,\r\n      though there is no adequate foundation for the statement that he\r\n      settled at Pressburg.  He returned to Wechmar during the beginning\r\n      of the Counter-Reformation under the Emperor Rudolph II. (1576-\r\n      1612), and died at Wechmar, March 8, 1619.  See Spitta, i. 4.\r\n\r\n      Apart from church and town registers, laboriously consulted by\r\n      Spitta in tracing the Bach genealogy, we owe our knowledge of it to\r\n      an MS. drawn up by Bach in 1735 which is now in the Berlin Royal\r\n      Library after being successively in the possession of Carl Philipp\r\n      Emmanuel, Forkel, and G. Pölchau, the Hamburg teacher of music.\r\n\r\n      The original entries in it are stated by Carl P. Emmanuel to be by\r\n      his father. Forkel also owned a Bach genealogical tree, given him by\r\n      Carl Philipp Emmanuel; it has disappeared. Traces of it exist in a\r\n      work published at Pressburg by Johann Matthias Korabinsky in 1784,\r\n      its insertion being due to the assumption that the Bachs were a\r\n      Hungarian family.  Forkel shared that error.  See Spitta’s Preface\r\n      on the whole question.  The MS. genealogy of 1735 is published by\r\n      the New Bachgesellschaft (XVIII. 3) in facsimile.\r\n\r\n   21 Veit, in fact, returned to his native village. His name, as has been\r\n      pointed out, implies a connection with Wechmar that must have dated\r\n      from infancy.  Moreover, there was living there in 1561 one Hans\r\n      Bach, an official of the municipality, who may be regarded\r\n      confidently as Veit’s father.\r\n\r\n   22 It has been suggested that the name Bach is the sole authority for\r\n      the statement that Veit was a baker.  But Spitta points out that the\r\n      vowel in the name is pronounced long and was frequently written\r\n      BAACH in the seventeenth century, a fact which makes it difficult to\r\n      associate the word with “Backer” (Baker).\r\n\r\n   23 In the Genealogy Johann Sebastian calls the instrument a Cythringen.\r\n\r\n   24 Hans Bach (d. Dec. 26, 1626) and (?) Lips Bach (d. Oct. 10, 1620).\r\n      See infra, Genealogical Tables I. and II. and note to the latter.\r\n\r\n   25 The “Stadt Pfeiferei,” or official town musical establishment,\r\n      descended from the musicians’ guilds of the Middle Ages and was\r\n      presided over by the Stadt Musiker, who enjoyed certain ancient\r\n      privileges and the monopoly of providing the music at open-air\r\n      festivities. Johann Jakob Brahms, the father of Johannes, was a\r\n      member of such a corporation at Hamburg, after having served his\r\n      apprenticeship for five years elsewhere.  See Florence May,\r\n      _Johannes Brahms,_ vol. i. pp. 48 ff.\r\n\r\n   26 See Genealogical Table II.  The three young Bachs were the sons of\r\n      Lips Bach and, presumably, nephews of Hans the “Spielmann.” The\r\n      youngest of them was named Jonas; the name of another was certainly\r\n      Wendel.  It is remarkable, in a period in which Italy was regarded\r\n      as the Mecca of musicians, that exceedingly few of the Bach family\r\n      found their way thither.  Besides the three sons of Lips Bach, only\r\n      Johann Nikolaus, 1669-1753 (see Table VI.), Johann Sebastian Bach’s\r\n      son Johann Christian, 1735-82 (see Table VIII.), and Carl P. E.\r\n      Bach’s son Sebastian (see Table VII.) seem to have visited Italy.\r\n\r\n   27 i.e. from Veit Bach.  Of the three names Forkel mentions the first\r\n      two were a generation before Johann Sebastian; the third, Johann\r\n      Bombard, was of the same generation as Johann Sebastian; none of the\r\n      three belonged to Johann Sebastian’s branch.\r\n\r\n   28 Eldest  son of Heinrich Bach (see Table VI.).  Whether he was Court\r\n      as well as Town Organist at Eisenach cannot be stated positively.\r\n\r\n   29 The _Alt-Bachische Archive_ is a collection of the compositions of\r\n      various members of the family, before and after Johann Sebastian,\r\n      formed largely by the latter.  From C. P. E. Bach it passed to G.\r\n      Pölchau and from him to the Berlin Royal Library.\r\n\r\n   30 Johann Christoph composed several Motets (see them discussed in\r\n      Spitta, i. 75 ff.).  The daring work to which Forkel alludes was\r\n      written about 1680 and is lost.  Though the augmented sixth was then\r\n      and remained unusual, Johann Christoph’s is not the earliest use of\r\n      it.  Spitta finds it in Giacomo Carissimi (1604-74).\r\n\r\n   31 The Cantata (“And there was war in heaven”) is analysed by Spitta\r\n      (i. 44).  The score is unusually full: two five-part choirs; Vn. 1\r\n      and 2, 4 Violas, Contrabasso, Fagotto, 4 Trombe, Timpani, Organ.  In\r\n      1726 Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a Cantata for Michaelmas on the\r\n      same text (Rev. xii. 7).\r\n\r\n   32 Spitta (i. 101 n.) characterises the statement as “a mythical\r\n      exaggeration.” In a chapter devoted to the instrumental works of\r\n      Johann Christoph and his brother he instances a collection of\r\n      forty-four Organ Chorals by the former, not one of which is in five\r\n      parts.\r\n\r\n   33 In the Bach genealogy already referred to C. P. E. Bach designates\r\n      Johann Christoph a “great and impressive composer.”\r\n\r\n   34 A _Lamento_ published under Johann Christoph’s name seems actually\r\n      to have been composed by his father Heinrich (see Pirro, _J.-S.\r\n      Bach,_ 9 n.). Johann Christoph, however, is the composer of the\r\n      Motet _Ich lasse dich nicht,_ so often attributed to Johann\r\n      Sebastian.\r\n\r\n   35 See Table VI. He was the father of Johann Sebastian’s first wife.\r\n\r\n   36 See note, p. 4 supra.\r\n\r\n   37 Spitta (i. 59 ff.) mentions twelve Motets by Michael Bach. Several\r\n      of them are for eight voices.  Forkel probably refers to the most\r\n      remarkable of Michael’s Motets, in which he detects the romantic\r\n      spirit of Johann Sebastian.  It is set to the words _Unser Leben ist\r\n      ein Schatten,_ (_Life on earth is but a shadow_).  The first choir\r\n      consists of 2 S., A., 2 T., B., and the second choir of A. T. B.\r\n      only. Spitta analyses the work closely (i. 70-72). Novello publishes\r\n      his five- part Motet _Christ is risen_ with an English text.\r\n\r\n   38 He succeeded his cousin Johann Christoph at Eisenach in 1703.\r\n\r\n   39 Spitta (i. 24 ff.) mentions four Suites, or Overtures, Clavier\r\n      pieces, and Organ Chorals as being by him.  That Johann Sebastian\r\n      Bach highly esteemed the Suites is proved by the fact that he copied\r\n      the parts of three of them with his own hand at Leipzig.\r\n\r\n   40 It is a curious fact that, prior to the career of Johann Sebastian\r\n      Bach, the composers of the Bach family occur invariably in other\r\n      branches than his.  With two exceptions, the gift of composition\r\n      appears to have been possessed, or exercised, solely by Heinrich\r\n      Bach (see Table VI.), his two sons Johann Christoph and Johann\r\n      Michael, already discussed, and his grandson, Johann Nikolaus (son\r\n      of Johann Christoph).  Heinrich Bach was a very productive composer\r\n      in all forms of musical art employed at that time in church (Sp. i.\r\n      36).  His grandson, Johann Nikolaus, composed a Mass and a comic\r\n      operetta (ib., 132 ff.). The only other Bach composer known to\r\n      Spitta is Georg Christoph, founder of the Franconian Bachs (see\r\n      Table IV.) and Cantor at Themar and Schweinfurt (ib. 155). The other\r\n      Bach composer outside Heinrich Bach’s branch is Johann Bornhard,\r\n      already mentioned by Forkel.\r\n\r\n   41 In the Quodlibet different voices sang different well-known\r\n      melodies, sacred and profane, and sought to combine them to form a\r\n      harmonious whole.  For an example see Variation 30 of the _Aria mit\r\n      30 Veranderungen_ (Peters’ ed., bk. 209 p. 83).  In it Bach combines\r\n      two popular songs of his period.\r\n\r\n   42 See article “Quodlibet” in Grove.\r\n\r\n   43 The date is conjectural, and is deduced from the fact that the\r\n      infant was baptized on March 23.  The Gregorian Calendar was not\r\n      adopted in Germany until 1701.  Had it been in use in 1685 Bach’s\r\n      birthday would be March 31.\r\n\r\n   44 Johann Ambrosius’ Court appointment is to be inferred from the fact\r\n      that in 1684 the Duke refused him permission to return to Erfurt.\r\n\r\n   45 See Table IV.\r\n\r\n   46 Johann Ambrosius survived his brother by nearly eighteen months.\r\n\r\n   47 His mother died in May 1694, and his father in January 1695.  At the\r\n      latter date Johann Sebastian was three months short of his tenth\r\n      year.\r\n\r\n   48 Excepting Johann Jakob, a lad of thirteen years, Johann Christoph\r\n      was Bach’s only surviving brother, and the only one of the family in\r\n      a position to look after him.  Johann Jakob accompanied Sebastian to\r\n      Ohrdruf (Pirro, p. 13) and afterwards apprenticed himself to his\r\n      father’s successor as Town Musician at Eisenach. One of the\r\n      daughters was already married.  What became of the other is not\r\n      stated. See Table V.\r\n\r\n   49 It is difficult to believe this statement.  That the boy was\r\n      destined for a musical career by his father hardly can be doubted.\r\n      That he was of unusual precocity, the story told by Forkel in the\r\n      text proves.  His father’s asserted neglect to instruct him is\r\n      therefore hardly credible.\r\n\r\n   50 Johann Jakob Froberger, born at Halle (date unknown); Court Organist\r\n      at Vienna, 1637-57; d. 1667.\r\n\r\n   51 Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer, c. 1660-1738 (actual dates of his\r\n      birth and death unknown); Kapellmeister to Markgraf Ludwig of Baden\r\n      at Schloss Schlackenwerth in Bohemia. His _Ariadne Musica\r\n      Neo-Organoedum_ (1702) was the precursor of Bach’s _Das\r\n      wohltemperirte Clavier._\r\n\r\n   52 Johann Caspar Kerl, b. 1628; Kapellmeister in Munich, 1656-74; Court\r\n      Organist at Vienna, 1677-92; d. 1693.\r\n\r\n   53 Johann Pachelbel, b. 1653, d. 1706.  In 1695 he was Organist of St.\r\n      Sebald’s Church, Nürnberg.  His influence upon the organ playing of\r\n      his generation was enormous.  Bach’s brother, Johann Christoph, was\r\n      his pupil.\r\n\r\n   54 Dietrich Buxtehude, b. 1637, d. 1707; Organist (1668) of the\r\n      Marienkirche, Lübeck, and the chief musical influence in North\r\n      Germany.\r\n\r\n   55 Nikolaus Bruhns, b. circ. 1665, d. 1697; a. pupil of Buxtehude;\r\n      Organist at Husum; the greatest organist of his time after\r\n      Buxtehude.\r\n\r\n   56 Georg Böhm, b. 1661; date of death uncertain (c. 1739); from 1698\r\n      Organist of the Johanniskirche, Lüneburg.\r\n\r\n   57 In fact, Johann Christoph did not die until 1721, more than twenty\r\n      years after Sebastian ceased to be under his roof.\r\n\r\n   58 The fact that Johann Christoph survived till 1721 disproves Forkel’s\r\n      statement. The youthful Bach, aged fifteen in 1700, no doubt seized\r\n      the earliest opportunity to relieve his brother of the charge of\r\n      him.  Moreover, Johann Christoph’s family was increasing (see Table\r\n      V.).  In spite of the story of Bach’s midnight copying, it cannot be\r\n      questioned that he owed a good deal to his brother, who not only\r\n      taught him but, presumably, maintained him at the Ohrdruf Lyceum,\r\n      where Bach acquired a sound education and a considerable knowledge\r\n      of Latin.  See Pirro, pp. 14-16, on Bach’s education at Ohrdruf.  He\r\n      left the Lyceum in March 1700.\r\n\r\n   59 Georg Erdmann, Bach’s fellow-pupil at the Lyceum.\r\n\r\n   60 Bach’s entry into the choir of St. Michael’s Convent, Lüneburg, took\r\n      place about Easter 1700.  The step was taken upon the advice of\r\n      Elias Herda, Cantor at the Ohrdruf Lyceum, himself a former member\r\n      of St. Michael’s.  Bach remained at St. Michael’s for three years,\r\n      till 1703.  The choir library was particularly rich in the best\r\n      church music of the period, both German and Italian.  Spitta is of\r\n      opinion that Bach’s talents as a violinist and Clavier player were\r\n      also laid under contribution.  His voice, as Forkel states, soon\r\n      ceased to be serviceable.  His maximum pay was one thaler (three\r\n      shillings) a month and free commons.\r\n\r\n   61 Probably Georg Böhm, who had relations with the Convent choir,\r\n      inspired Bach to make the pilgrimage.  Böhm, then at St. John’s,\r\n      Lüneburg, was a pupil of Reinken of Hamburg.  Spitta (i. 196)\r\n      suggests that Bach’s cousin, Johann Ernst (see Table IV.), was at\r\n      this time completing his musical education at Hamburg, a fact which\r\n      may have contributed to draw Bach thither.  He made more than one\r\n      visit, on foot, to Hamburg.  F. W. Marpurg published, in 1786, the\r\n      story, which he received from Bach himself, that on one of his\r\n      journeys from Hamburg, Bach sat down outside an inn and hungrily\r\n      sniffed the savours from its kitchen.  His pockets were empty and\r\n      there seemed little prospect of a meal, when a window was opened and\r\n      two herring heads were thrown out.  Bach picked them up eagerly, and\r\n      found in each of them a Danish ducat.  Who was his benefactor he\r\n      never discovered; the gift enabled him to satisfy his hunger and pay\r\n      another visit to Hamburg.\r\n\r\n   62 Johann Adam Reinken, b. 1623, became Organist of St. Catherine’s\r\n      Church, Hamburg, in 1664, and held the post until his death in 1722.\r\n\r\n   63 His introduction to French music marked another step in Bach’s\r\n      progressive education.  The reigning Duke of Celle (father-in-law of\r\n      George I. of Great Britain and Ireland) had married a Frenchwoman.\r\n      See Pirro, _J. S. Bach,_ pp. 24-27.\r\n\r\n   64 He entered the Weimar service on April 8, 1703 (Pirro, p. 29).\r\n\r\n   65 Bach’s engagement was in the private band of the younger brother of\r\n      the Duke.  He remained in his new post only a few months.  He was\r\n      engaged as a Violin player, and since his interests were towards the\r\n      Organ and Clavier, it is clear that he accepted the engagement as a\r\n      temporary means of livelihood.\r\n\r\n   66 He is, however, described in July 1703 as Court Organist (Pirro, p.\r\n      30).  Bach was drawn to Arnstadt chiefly by the fact that the New\r\n      Church recently had been equipped with a particularly fine Organ\r\n      (specification in Spitta, i. 224), which existed until 1863.  Bach\r\n      inaugurated it on July 13, 1703, and entered on his duties as\r\n      Organist of the church in the following month (Pirro, p. 30).\r\n\r\n   67 His earliest Church Cantata (No. 15) was composed here in 1704.  To\r\n      the Arnstadt period (1703-7) also must be attributed the Capriccio\r\n      written on the departure of his brother, Johann Jakob (Peters bk.\r\n      208 p. 62), the Capriccio in honour of his Ohrdruf brother, Johann\r\n      Christoph (Peters bk. 215, p. 34), the Sonata in D major (Peters bk.\r\n      215, p. 44), the Organ Prelude and Fugue in C minor (Novello bk. 2\r\n      p. 48), and the Organ Fugue in C minor (Novello bk. 12 p. 95).\r\n\r\n   68 In the _Nekrolog_ C. P. E. Bach and Agricola remark of the Arnstadt\r\n      period, that Bach then “really showed the first-fruits of his\r\n      industry in the art of Organ-playing and composition, which he had\r\n      in great measure learnt only from the study of the works of the most\r\n      famous composers of the time, and from his own reflections on them”\r\n      (quoted in Spitta, i. 235).\r\n\r\n   69 Bach’s stipend at Arnstadt was not inconsiderable, and his duties\r\n      engaged him only at stated hours on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays.\r\n      He, therefore, had leisure and the means to employ it.  In October\r\n      1705 he obtained four weeks’ leave of absence and set off on foot to\r\n      Lübeck, after leaving an efficient deputy behind him.  He stayed\r\n      away until February 1706.  On his return the Consistory demanded an\r\n      explanation of his absence, and took the opportunity to remonstrate\r\n      with him on other matters.  They charged him “with having been\r\n      hitherto in the habit of making surprising variationes in the\r\n      Chorals, and intermixing divers strange sounds, so that thereby the\r\n      congregation were confounded.”  They charged him with playing too\r\n      long preludes, and after this was notified to him, of making them\r\n      too short.  They reproached him “with having gone to a wineshop last\r\n      Sunday during sermon,” and cautioned him that, “for the future he\r\n      must behave quite differently and much better than he has done\r\n      hitherto” (see the whole charge in Spitta, i. 315 ff.).  Bach also\r\n      was on bad terms with the choir, whose members had got out of hand\r\n      and discipline.  Before his Lübeck visit he engaged in a street\r\n      brawl with one of the scholars.  Then, as later, he was a choleric\r\n      gentleman.  In November 1706 he got into further trouble for having\r\n      “made music” in the church with a “stranger maiden,” presumably his\r\n      cousin Maria Barbara Bach, then on a visit to Arnstadt; he married\r\n      her a year later.  Clearly the relations between the Consistory and\r\n      the brilliant young Organist were becoming difficult, and Bach’s\r\n      migration to Mühlhausen no doubt was grateful to both.  His\r\n      resignation was made formally on June 29, 1707.\r\n\r\n   70 Bach was appointed on June 15, 1707, to succeed Johann Georg Able.\r\n      Mühlhauson prided itself upon its musical traditions.  Bach’s\r\n      Cantata, No. 71, written in February 1708 for the inauguration of\r\n      the Mühlhausen Town Council, was engraved (the parts only), the only\r\n      one of the 206 Cantatas which have come down to us which was printed\r\n      during Bach’s lifetime.  He also composed Cantatas 131 and 196 at\r\n      Muhlhausen, and perhaps three others. See infra, p. 188.\r\n\r\n   71 Bach’s petition to the Mühlhausen Consistory for permission to\r\n      resign his post is dated June 25, 1708, and is printed in full by\r\n      Spitta, i. 373.  Bach mentions the Weimar post as having been\r\n      offered to him, but bases his desire to resign the organ of St.\r\n      Blasius, partly on the ground that his income was inadequate, partly\r\n      because, though he had succeeded in improving the organ and the\r\n      conditions of music generally, he saw “not the slightest appearance\r\n      that things will be altered” for the better.  Mühlhausen, in fact,\r\n      was a stronghold of Pietism and unsympathetic to Bach’s musical\r\n      ideals.\r\n\r\n   72 He was Court Organist and Kammermusikus.  In the latter post Bach\r\n      was of use as a Violinist and Clavier player.  The Court band, or\r\n      Kapelle, on special occasions appeared in Hungarian costume, which\r\n      Bach presumably donned.  His income began at a sum nearly double\r\n      that he had received at Arnstadt and Mühlhausen.\r\n\r\n   73 The character of his employer, Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar,\r\n      must be reckoned a factor in the development of the youthful Bach.\r\n      The Duke was not only a cultured artist, but was also a man of\r\n      genuine piety.\r\n\r\n   74 Though Bach retouched them in later years and wrote others, it may\r\n      be stated in general terms that his Organ works were the fruit of\r\n      the Weimar period, which lasted from 1708 till 1717.\r\n\r\n   75 Bach’s promotion to the position of Concertmeister had taken place\r\n      certainly before March 19, 1714, on which date Spitta (i. 517)\r\n      prints a letter in which Bach gives himself the title.  The increase\r\n      in his income early in 1714 also supports the conclusion, while a\r\n      letter of January 14, 1714, written by Bach, is not signed by him as\r\n      Concertmeister.  It would seem that his promotion took place in the\r\n      interval between the two letters.  As Concertmeister it was part of\r\n      his duty to provide Cantatas for the church services.  Twenty-two\r\n      were written by him at Weimar.  See infra, p. 188, for a list of\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n   76 Friedrich Wilhelm Zachau died on August 7 or 14, 1712.\r\n\r\n   77 Spitta (i. 513) infers that, in the later years of the Weimar\r\n      period, Bach spent part of the autumn of every year in visits to the\r\n      Courts and larger towns of Germany in order to give Organ recitals\r\n      and to conduct performances of his Cantatas. Besides the visit to\r\n      Halle, in 1713, to which Forkel alludes, Bach performed at Cassel in\r\n      1713 or 1714 before the future Frederick I. of Sweden, who presented\r\n      him with a ring which he drew from his finger.  Bach’s feet, an\r\n      admirer recorded, “flew over the pedal-board as if they had wings.”\r\n      In December 1714 he visited Leipzig and performed Cantata No. 61,\r\n      _Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland._  In 1716 he was again invited to\r\n      Halle, and at about the same time performed at Meiningen. Forkel\r\n      records the famous contest with Marchand, the French Organist, at\r\n      Dresden in 1717.\r\n\r\n   78 Forkel’s brief account follows the _Nekrolog._  Bach was in Halle in\r\n      the autumn of 1713, a year after Zachau’s death.  The latter’s post\r\n      was still vacant and a new and particularly large Organ (sixty-three\r\n      speaking stops) was being erected.  The authorities pressed Bach to\r\n      submit himself to the prescribed tests, and he complied so far as to\r\n      compose a Cantata and to conduct a performance of it.  On his return\r\n      to Weimar he received a formal invitation to accept the post.  After\r\n      some correspondence Bach refused it, partly, perhaps chiefly, on the\r\n      ground that the income was inadequate.  The refusal was answered by\r\n      the groundless accusation that he had merely entertained the Halle\r\n      proposal in order to bring pressure upon Weimar for a rise of\r\n      salary.  The misunderstanding was cleared away by 1716, when Bach\r\n      visited Halle again.  In the interval Zachau’s post had been given\r\n      to his pupil, Gottfried Kirchhoff.  The whole matter is discussed at\r\n      length in Spitta, i. 515 ff.\r\n\r\n   79 Frederick Augustus I. of Saxony was elected, as Augustus II., to the\r\n      throne of Poland in 1697. He died In 1733.\r\n\r\n   80 Louis Marchand, b. 1669, d. 1732; Organist to the French Court and\r\n      later of the Church of St. Honoré, Paris.  His arrival in Dresden\r\n      was due to his being in disgrace at Versailles. Whether or not he\r\n      was offered a permanent engagement at the Saxon Court, he was\r\n      regarded as the champion of the French style, and as such the\r\n      challenge was issued to him by Bach.\r\n\r\n   81 Francois Couperin, b. 1668, d. 1733; Organist of St. Gervais, Paris.\r\n      Forkel’s judgment upon his art is not supported by modern criticism.\r\n\r\n   82 Bach, however, admired Marchand’s compositions sufficiently to give\r\n      them to his pupils. See Pirro, p. 52.\r\n\r\n   83 Jean-Baptiste Volumier, an acquaintance of Bach, according to Spitta\r\n      (i. 583). Eitner, _Quellen Lexikon._ says that he was born in Spain\r\n      and educated in France.  Grove’s _Dictionary_ declares him a\r\n      Belgian.  In 1709 he was appointed Concertmeister to the Saxon\r\n      Court.  He died at Dresden in 1728.\r\n\r\n   84 It is more probable that Bach was at Dresden either expressly to\r\n      hear Marchand or upon one of his autumn tours.\r\n\r\n   85 Some years earlier Flemming had witnessed Handel’s triumphant\r\n      descent on the Saxon Court, but had failed to establish friendly\r\n      relations with him.  See Streatfield’s _Handel_, p. 87.\r\n\r\n   86 The article on Marchand in Grove gives a different version of the\r\n      affair, based upon Joseph Fétis (1784-1871).  According to this\r\n      story of the event, Bach, summoned from Weimar, attended Marchand’s\r\n      concert incognito, and after hearing Marchand perform, was invited\r\n      by Volumier to take his seat at the Clavier.  Bach thereupon\r\n      repeated from memory Marchand’s theme and variations, and added\r\n      others of his own.  Having ended, he handed Marchand a theme for\r\n      treatment on the Organ and challenged him to a contest.  Marchand\r\n      accepted it, but left Dresden before the appointed hour.\r\n\r\n   87 The Prince was brother-in-law of Duke Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar.\r\n      Bach was, therefore, already known to him and showed the greatest\r\n      regard for him both at Cöthen and after he had left his service.\r\n\r\n   88 The reason for Bach’s migration from Weimar to Cöthen was his\r\n      failure to obtain the post of Kapellmeister at the former Court upon\r\n      the death of Johann Samuel Drese in 1716. The post was given to\r\n      Drese’s son. On August 1, 1717, just before or after his Marchand\r\n      triumph, Bach was appointed Kapellmeister to the Court of Cöthen.\r\n      Duke Wilhelm Ernst refused to release him from his engagement, and\r\n      Bach endured imprisonment from November 6 to December 2, 1717, for\r\n      demanding instant permission to take up his new post.  Probably his\r\n      last work at Weimar was to put the _Orgelbüchlein_ into the form in\r\n      which it has come down to us (see articles by the present writer in\r\n      _The Musical Times_ for January-March 1917).\r\n\r\n      With his departure from Weimar in 1718 Bach left behind him the\r\n      distinctively Organ period of his musical fertility.  Though his\r\n      compositions were still by no means generally known, as a player he\r\n      held an unchallenged pre-eminence.\r\n\r\n   89 He was appointed to Cöthen on August 1, 1717, and was inducted at\r\n      Leipzig on May 31, 1723.\r\n\r\n   90 The date actually was November 1720.  At Cöthen Bach had an inferior\r\n      Organ and little scope for his attainments; his chief duties were in\r\n      connection with the Prince’s band.  The yearning to get back to the\r\n      Organ, which eventually took him to Leipzig in 1723, shows itself in\r\n      his readiness to entertain an invitation to Hamburg in 1720.\r\n\r\n   91 Three Organ movements by Bach upon Wolfgang Dachstein’s melody, _An\r\n      Wasserflüssen Babylon,_ are extant.  See notes upon them and their\r\n      relation to the Hamburg extemporisation in Terry, _Bach’s Chorals,_\r\n      Part III.\r\n\r\n   92 As at Halle in 1713, Bach does not appear to have gone to Hamburg\r\n      specially to compete for the post of Organist to the Church of St.\r\n      James, vacant by the death of Heinrich Friese in September 1720.  He\r\n      was not able to stay to take part in the final tests, nor was he\r\n      asked to submit to them, since his visit to Hamburg had given him an\r\n      opportunity to display his gifts.  In the result the post was given\r\n      to Johann Joachim Heitmann, who acknowledged his appointment by\r\n      forthwith paying 4000 marks to the treasury of the Church.  See\r\n      Spitta, ii. 17 ff.\r\n\r\n   93 Johann Kuhnau died on June 25, 1722.\r\n\r\n   94 On the title-pages of his published works Bach describes himself as\r\n      “Capellm. und Direct. Chor. Mus. Lips.”\r\n\r\n   95 Forkel has practically nothing to say regarding the Leipzig period\r\n      of Bach’s musical life.  That a professed historian of music,\r\n      setting before the public for the first time the life of one whom he\r\n      so greatly extolled, and with every inducement to present as\r\n      complete a picture of him as was possible, should have taken no\r\n      trouble to carry his investigations beyond the point C. P. E. Bach\r\n      and Agricola had reached in the _Nekrolog_ of 1754 is almost\r\n      incredible.  The only reason that can be adduced, apart from the\r\n      lack of a really scientific impulse, is that Forkel was almost\r\n      entirely ignorant of the flood of concerted church music which\r\n      poured from Leipzig from 1723 to 1744.  His criticism of Bach as a\r\n      composer is restricted practically to Bach’s Organ and Clavier\r\n      works.\r\n\r\n   96 On November 19, 1728.  Latterly his interest in music had waned.\r\n      The fact, along with Bach’s concern for the education of his sons\r\n      and his desire to return to the Organ, explains his abandonment of\r\n      the more dignified Cöthen appointment.\r\n\r\n   97 The score of this work was in Forkel’s possession, but was missing\r\n      from his library in 1818 and was assumed to be lost until, in 1873,\r\n      Rust was able to show that Bach used for the occasion certain\r\n      choruses and Arias from the _St. Matthew Passion,_ which he was then\r\n      writing, with the first chorus of the _Trauer-Ode_ as an opening of\r\n      the extemporised work.  See Spitta, ii. 618; Schweitzer, ii. 208.\r\n\r\n   98 In 1723 he received the title Hochfürstlich Weissenfelsische\r\n      wirkliche Kapellmeister and retained it till his death.  He retained\r\n      also his Cöthen appointment.\r\n\r\n   99 Augustus III. Bach had petitioned for the appointment in a letter\r\n      dated July 27, 1733 (Spitta, iii. 38), forwarding a copy of the\r\n      newly-written Kyrie and Gloria of the B minor Mass.\r\n\r\n  100 There does not appear to be any ground for the suggestion that the\r\n      post of Hofcomponist to the Dresden Court was attached ex officio to\r\n      the St. Thomas’ Cantorate.  Bach applied for it in 1733, taking\r\n      advantage of the recent accession of the new sovereign, Augustus\r\n      III., in February 1733.\r\n\r\n  101 Friedemann was then at Halle.\r\n\r\n  102 May 7, 1747, according to Spitta, quoting Friedrich Wilhelm\r\n      Marpurg’s _Historisch-kritische Beyträge zur Aufnahme der Musik,_\r\n      which appeared in 5 vols. between 1754-1778.  On the other hand,\r\n      Spener, who first records the event, states briefly: “May 11,1747.\r\n      His Majesty was informed that Kapellmeister Bach had arrived in\r\n      Potsdam, and that he was in the King’s ante-chamber, waiting His\r\n      Majesty’s gracious permission to enter, and hear the music.  His\r\n      Majesty at once commanded that he should be admitted” (Spitta, iii.\r\n      231 n.).  If the Marpurg and Spener dates are reliable, it looks as\r\n      though Friedemann’s story of his father, travel-stained and weary,\r\n      being hurried incontinent into the presence of the King is a piece\r\n      of picturesque embroidery.\r\n\r\n  103 Clearly this was a story that Wilhelm Friedemann prided himself on\r\n      the telling, and Forkel’s remark suggests the need for caution in\r\n      accepting all its details.  Frederick’s courtesy to Bach, however,\r\n      tends to discredit the story that ten years earlier (1737) Handel\r\n      deliberately refused to meet the King at Aix-la-Chapelle owing to\r\n      the peremptoriness of his summons.  Mr. Streatfleld (p. 145) also\r\n      shows that Frederick was not at Aix until 1741, when Handel was\r\n      writing the _Messiah_ in London.\r\n\r\n  104 Gottfried Silbermann, a pioneer of the modern pianoforte.  Bach was\r\n      already familiar with his Claviers with hammer action, and indeed\r\n      had offered useful criticism of which Silbermann had taken\r\n      advantage. See Spitta, ii. 46.\r\n\r\n  105 * The pianofortes manufactured by Silbermann, of Freiberg, pleased\r\n      the King so much, that he resolved to buy them all.  He collected\r\n      fifteen.  I hear that they all now stand, unfit for use, in various\r\n      corners of the Royal Palace.  [Robert Eitner, in 1873, found one of\r\n      the pianos in Frederick the Great’s room at Potsdam.]\r\n\r\n  106 According to another account, which Spitta (iii. 232) follows, Bach\r\n      played before a large congregation in the Church of the Holy Spirit,\r\n      Potsdam. The King does not appear to have been present. The\r\n      extemporisation of the six-part Fugue took place in Frederick’s\r\n      presence on the evening of that day.\r\n\r\n  107 Bach’s letter to Frederick accompanying the gift is dated 7th July\r\n      1747. He calls it “a musical offering, of which the noblest portion\r\n      is the work of Your Majesty’s illustrious hand.”  In addition to\r\n      Forkel’s analysis it contains a Sonata for Flute, Violin, and\r\n      Clavier, and a canon perpetuus for the same three instruments.\r\n\r\n  108 John Taylor (1703-72), oculist to George II.  The operation took\r\n      place in the winter of 1749-50. Taylor is said to have operated on\r\n      Handel in 1751 (see the article on him in the _Dict. Nat.\r\n      Biography._).  Streatfield (_Handel,_ p. 212), however, does not\r\n      mention Taylor, and his account suggests that Samuel Sharp, of Guy’s\r\n      Hospital, was the operator in Handel’s case.\r\n\r\n  109 The actual date was July 28, at 8.45 P.M. Bach was working to the\r\n      very moment of his collapse on July 18.  Probably his last work was\r\n      the Choral Prelude (Novello bk. xvii. 85) on the melody _Wenn wir in\r\n      höchsten Nöthen sein._  Facing eternity, he bade his son-in-law,\r\n      Altnikol, inscribe the movement with the title of the Hymn, _Vor\r\n      deinen Thron tret ich hiemit,_ whose first stanza filled his mind:\r\n\r\n      Before Thy throne, my God, I stand,\r\n      Myself, my all, are in Thy hand.\r\n\r\n      An addendum to the Genealogy, in C. P. E. Bach’s hand, gives July 30\r\n      as the date of his father’s death.\r\n\r\n  110 July 18.\r\n\r\n  111 See Genealogical Tables VII. and VIII.\r\n\r\n  112 The statement is misleading.  Of the five sons of the first\r\n      marriage, two were famous, two died in infancy, and the fifth\r\n      abandoned a promising musical career for the law. Of the six sons of\r\n      the second marriage, one was imbecile, three died in infancy, two\r\n      were famous.\r\n\r\n  113 See Introduction, p. XXI, supra.\r\n\r\n  114 In view of Bach’s memorial of August 23, 1730 (infra), this seems to\r\n      be  the meaning of the resolution.\r\n\r\n_  115 Steigt freudig in die Luft,_ first performed at Cöthen, set to a\r\n      new text, _Schwingt freudig euch empor._\r\n\r\n  116 The well-known portrait by C. F. Rr. Liszewski in the Joachimsthal\r\n      Gymnasium, Berlin, was painted in 1772, twenty-two years after\r\n      Bach’s death.  It represents him at a table with music-paper before\r\n      him and an adjacent Clavier.  Pirro uses for his frontispiece a\r\n      portrait by Geber, which bears no resemblance whatever to the\r\n      Haussmann or Volbach pictures.  Mention must also be made of a\r\n      singularly engaging picture of Bach at the age of thirty-five.  It\r\n      hangs in the Eisenach Bach Museum and is by Johann Jak. Ihle.  It is\r\n      reproduced as the frontispiece of this volume.\r\n\r\n  117 His _Versuch über die wahre Art des Klavier zu spielen_ was\r\n      published (Part I.) in 1753.\r\n\r\n  118 Forkel’s meaning can be made clear in the following manner: place\r\n      the thumb and fingers of either hand upon the notes C D E F G of the\r\n      pianoforte so that the three middle fingers lie more or less flat\r\n      upon the keys; then draw back the three middle fingers until they\r\n      form an arch having their tips approximately in a straight line with\r\n      the tips of the thumb and little finger upon the keys.\r\n\r\n  119 It must be remembered that Forkel is speaking of the Clavier and not\r\n      of the Pianoforte.\r\n\r\n  120 The Harpsichord, as its name implies, was an instrument whose\r\n      strings were plucked by a plectrum. Bach preferred the older\r\n      Clavier, or Clavichord, which could be regulated, as the other could\r\n      not, by nicety of touch. See note, p. 68, infra.\r\n\r\n  121 Schweitzer (i. 208) points out that Bach’s touch was modern, in that\r\n      he realised that “singing tone” depends not only upon the manner in\r\n      which the keys are struck, but, to a great extent, on the regulation\r\n      of their ascent.\r\n\r\n      Of Handel’s touch, Burney writes (quoted by Rockstro, p. 349): “His\r\n      touch was so smooth, and the tone of the instrument so much\r\n      cherished, that his fingers seemed to grow to the keys.  They were\r\n      so curved and compact when he played, that no motion, and scarcely\r\n      the fingers themselves, could be discovered.”\r\n\r\n  122 At the beginning of the seventeenth century, as Spitta points out\r\n      (ii. 34), the art of fingering had not developed.  Speaking\r\n      generally, neither thumb nor little finger was employed.  It was not\r\n      until the beginning of the eighteenth century that a scientific\r\n      method emerged, a development rendered necessary by the advance in\r\n      the modes of musical expression.  C. P. E. Bach, quoted by\r\n      Schweitzer (i. 206), puts this concisely: “My late father told me\r\n      that in his youth he had heard great men who never used the thumb\r\n      except when it was necessary to make big stretches.  But he lived in\r\n      an epoch when there came about gradually a most remarkable change in\r\n      musical taste, and therefore found it necessary to work out for\r\n      himself a much more thorough use of the fingers, and especially of\r\n      the thumb, which, besides performing other good services, is quite\r\n      indispensable in the difficult keys, where it must be used as nature\r\n      intends.”\r\n\r\n  123 According to Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch, Clavichords with special strings\r\n      for each note (bundfrei) were known in Bach’s time.\r\n\r\n  124 In the _Essay_ already referred to.  For a discussion of Couperin’s\r\n      method see Spitta, ii. 37 ff.\r\n\r\n  125 For instance, the Rondeau in B flat in Anna Magdalena’s _Noten-\r\n      buch_ (No. 6) (1725) is by Couperin.\r\n\r\n  126 No doubt the friend who prepared this trap for Bach was Johann\r\n      Gottfried Walther.  His compositions frequently were characterised\r\n      by intricacy.\r\n\r\n  127 Mozart had the same gift.  When visiting St. Thomas’ School in 1789,\r\n      he heard with astonishment a performance of Bach’s Motet, _ Singet\r\n      dem Herrn ein neues Lied._ “At the conclusion he expressed his\r\n      delight, and said, ‘Now that is something from which a man may\r\n      learn.’  On being informed that Bach was Cantor to this school, and\r\n      that his Motets were venerated there as reliques, he was eager to\r\n      see them.  No score being to be obtained, they handed him the\r\n      separate parts, and it was interesting to observe his manner of\r\n      reading them, holding some in his hands, some on his knees, placing\r\n      some on chairs around him; seeming thoroughly lost to everything,\r\n      and not rising till he had thoroughly satisfied his curiosity”\r\n      (Holmes, _Life of Mozart,_ ed. Dent, p. 251).\r\n\r\n  128 There were in Bach’s time three “Clavier” instruments in use. The\r\n      oldest, the Clavichord, as a rule, had two strings to every note,\r\n      set in motion by a “tangent” striking them from below.  Its\r\n      advantage was that it permitted the tone to be regulated by the\r\n      touch.  For that reason, though its tone was weak, Bach preferred\r\n      it.  The Clavicembalo, or Harpsichord, as it is called in the text,\r\n      was in general known as the “Flügel,” the strings being plucked, or\r\n      flipped by a quill or metal pin, after the manner of the modern\r\n      mandoline. The third instrument was the “piano e forte,” or\r\n      Hammerclavier. The Clavicembalo was also built with two keyboards,\r\n      like an Organ, and a pedal-board provided with strings.  It was for\r\n      this instrument that the so-called Organ Sonatas of Bach were\r\n      written.  He possessed five Clavicembali, but not a single\r\n      Clavichord at the time of his death. For that reason it has been\r\n      questioned whether Forkel is accurate in stating that Bach preferred\r\n      the latter instrument. See Schweitzer, i. 200 ff.\r\n\r\n  129 Peters bk. 207 p. 4.\r\n\r\n  130 The truth of this remark is very evident in the _Orgelbüchlein._\r\n\r\n  131 Forkel writes as though he were in a position by personal knowledge\r\n      to compare the gifts of Bach and his son.  In fact he was born in\r\n      1749 and was less than two years old when Bach died.\r\n\r\n  132 On Bach’s use of the stops see Spitta, i. 394 ff., and Pirro’s\r\n      _L’Orgue de J.-S. Bach._\r\n\r\n  133 Johann Joachim Quantz, b. 1697; flute player and composer; taught\r\n      Frederick the Great the flute; settled at Berlin as Kammer-musikus\r\n      and Court Composer; d. 1773.\r\n\r\n  134 The _Nekrolog_ sums up more briefly than Forkel, in a judgment\r\n      which, without doubt, is the very truth: “Bach was the greatest\r\n      Organ player that had yet been known.”\r\n\r\n  135 Johann Adolph Scheibe, a native of Leipzig, was an unsuccessful\r\n      candidate for the Organistship of St. Thomas’ Church in 1729.  Bach\r\n      was one of the judges.  In 1737 Scheibe published in the “Kritische\r\n      Musikus” a criticism of Bach which, while doing justice to his\r\n      powers as an organist, characterised his compositions as “turgid and\r\n      confused in character.”  Bach was incensed by the criticism and\r\n      asked his friend, Professor Birnbaum of Leipzig, to answer it.\r\n      Scheibe replied in 1739, with a wholly unjustified challenge of\r\n      Bach’s general education and culture. In his “Phoebus and Pan,”\r\n      performed in 1731, Bach had already had the satisfaction of\r\n      representing Scheibe as “Midas” and calling him an ass.  On the\r\n      whole matter see Schweitzer, i. 178 ff. and Spitta, iii. 252.\r\n      Scheibe conducted the Court orchestra at Copenhagen from 1742-49 and\r\n      died there in 1776.\r\n\r\n  136 Georg Andreas Sorge, “Court and Town Organist to the Count of Reuss\r\n      and Plau at Lobenstein,” in his dedication thus commended Bach: “The\r\n      great musical virtue that Your Excellency possesses is embellished\r\n      with the excellent virtue of affability and unfeigned love of your\r\n      neighbour.” See Schweitzer, i. 155.\r\n\r\n  137 The following passage from the Autobiography of Hector Berlioz (ed.\r\n      Dent, p. 11) is relevant: “My father would never let me learn the\r\n      piano; if he had, no doubt I should have joined the noble army of\r\n      piano thumpers…Sometimes I regret my ignorance, yet, when I think of\r\n      the ghastly heap of platitudes for which that unfortunate piano is\r\n      made the daily excuse—insipid, shameless productions, that would be\r\n      impossible if their perpetrators had to rely, as they ought, on\r\n      pencil and paper alone—then I thank the fates for having forced me\r\n      to compose silently and freely by saving me from the tyranny of\r\n      finger-work, that grave of original thought.”\r\n\r\n  138 Antonio Vivaldi, A. 1743; a master of form.  That fact turned the\r\n      attention of German composers to him; while the popularity of his\r\n      Violin Concertos also attracted musicians, like Bach, whose work at\r\n      Cöthen was in close association with the Court Kapelle or band.\r\n\r\n  139 Bach re-wrote sixteen Vivaldi Violin Concertos for the Clavier, four\r\n      of them for the Organ, and developed one into a Concerto for four\r\n      Claviers and a quartet of strings which Forkel enumerates ( infra,\r\n      p. 132) as a composition of Bach’s (Peters bk. 260). Bach learnt\r\n      from Vivaldi “clearness and plasticity of musical structure.” See\r\n      article _Vivaldi_ in Grove; Spitta, i. 411 ff; Schweitzer, i. 192\r\n      ff.  The Vivaldi Clavier Concertos are in Peters bk. 217; the Organ\r\n      Concertos in Novello bk. 11. Not all these transcriptions are based\r\n      on Vivaldi. See Schweitzer, i. 193.\r\n\r\n  140 Girolamo Frescobaldi, b. 1583, d. 1644; Organist of St. Peter’s,\r\n      Rome.\r\n\r\n  141 Delphin Strungk, b. 1601, d. 1694; Organist of St. Martin’s,\r\n      Brunswick; composed for the Organ.\r\n\r\n  142 Purcell should be added to those whom Forkel mentions as Bach’s\r\n      models. See infra, p. 261.\r\n\r\n  143 * See Kirnberger’s “Kunst des reinen Satzes,” p. 157. [The work was\r\n      published in two volumes at Berlin in 1771, 1776.]\r\n\r\n  144 Transitus regularis= a passing note on the unaccented portions of\r\n      the bar; transitut irregularis=a passing note on the accented part\r\n      of the bar.\r\n\r\n  145 Spitta (iii. 315 ff. ) prints a treatise by Bach, _Rules and\r\n      Instructions for playing Thorough-bass or Accompaniment in Four\r\n      Parts,_ dated 1738. Rule 3 of chap. vi. states: “Two fifths or two\r\n      octaves must not occur next one another, for this is not only a\r\n      fault, but it sounds wrong.  To avoid this there is an old rule,\r\n      that the hands must always go against one another, so that when the\r\n      left goes up the right must go down, and when the right goes up the\r\n      left must go down.”\r\n\r\n  146 Actually the third beat of the fourth bar from the end. P. bk. 1 p.\r\n      37 Fugue no. 9.\r\n\r\n  147 Forkel edited the _Wohltemperirte Clavier_ for Hoffmeister in 1801.\r\n\r\n  148 The rule is not in the _Rules and Instructions_ already referred to.\r\n\r\n  149 Suite No. 6, in D minor (P. bk. 204 p. 84).\r\n\r\n  150 * Many people hold the opinion that the best melody is one which the\r\n      largest number of persons can understand and sing.  But this cannot\r\n      be admitted, for if it were true, popular airs which are sung up and\r\n      down the country by all classes, even the lowest, must be accounted\r\n      the finest and best.  I should be inclined to state the proposition\r\n      conversely: a melody which attracts everybody is invariably of the\r\n      most ordinary kind.  In that form the statement might, perhaps, pass\r\n      as a principle.\r\n\r\n  151 Forkel alludes to the _Goldberg Variations_ (P. bk. 209).\r\n\r\n  152 P. bks. 205, 206.\r\n\r\n  153 P. bks. 203, 204.\r\n\r\n  154 P. bk. 207.\r\n\r\n  155 Bach wrote three Suites (Partita) and three Sonatas for Solo Violin.\r\n      They date from about 1720 and are in the keys of G minor, B minor, A\r\n      minor, D minor, C major, and E major (P. bk. 228).  The six\r\n      Violoncello Suites date from the same period and are in G major, D\r\n      minor, C major, E flat major, C minor, and D major (P. bks. 238a,\r\n      238b).\r\n\r\n  156 Reinhard Keiser, b. 1673, d. 1739; scholar of the Leipzig\r\n      Thomas-schule; settled at Hamburg, 1694; composed a number of\r\n      Operas, and for a time had a great vogue.\r\n\r\n  157 It was precisely his agreeable operatic Arias that expressed\r\n      Handel’s genius in the eyes of his generation.  With rare exceptions\r\n      that branch of his work is obsolete and his cult survives mainly in\r\n      the _Messiah,_ which supports his quite posthumous reputation as\r\n      “musician in ordinary to the Protestant religion.” See Mr. R. A.\r\n      Streatfield’s _Handel,_ Introduction.\r\n\r\n  158 Schweitzer advances the opinion, which may perhaps be challenged,\r\n      that inevitable and natural as Bach’s melodies are, they do not give\r\n      the impression of “effortless invention.”  Bach, he holds, worked\r\n      like a mathematician, who sees the whole of a problem at once, and\r\n      has only to realise it in definite values.  Hence, he agrees with\r\n      Spitta, Bach’s way of working was quite different from Beethoven’s.\r\n      With Beethoven the work developed by means of episodes that are\r\n      independent of the theme.  With Bach everything springs with\r\n      mathematical certainty from the theme itself. See Schweitzer (i.\r\n      211) on Bach’s methods of working.\r\n\r\n  159 Johann Sebastian Bach’s _Vierstimmige Choralgesänge_ were published\r\n      in 1765 and 1769.  C. P. E. Bach was concerned only with the first\r\n      volume.  Forkel perhaps refers to an edition of the _Choralgesänge _\r\n      issued by Breitkopf in four parts at Leipzig in 1784, 1785, 1786,\r\n      and 1787, and edited by C. P. E. Bach.\r\n\r\n  160 Forkel indicates the period 1720-1750.  But in 1720 Bach had already\r\n      completed the _Orgelbüchlein_ and the greater part of his Organ\r\n      works.\r\n\r\n  161 * There are people who conclude that Bach merely perfected harmony.\r\n      But if we realise what harmony is, a means to extend and emphasise\r\n      musical expression, we cannot imagine it apart from melody.  And\r\n      when, as in Bach’s case, harmony is actually an association of\r\n      melodies, such a view becomes the more ridiculous.  It might perhaps\r\n      be reasonable to say of a composer that his influence was restricted\r\n      to the sphere of melody, because we may get melody without harmony.\r\n      But there cannot be real harmony without melody.  Hence the composer\r\n      who has perfected harmony has influenced the whole, whereas the\r\n      melodist has left his mark only on a fraction of his art.\r\n\r\n  162 As has been pointed out already (supra, p. 14) Bach’s earliest\r\n      church Cantatas date from the Arnstadt period.\r\n\r\n  163 The statement certainly needs a caveat.  No composer of his period\r\n      studied his text more closely or reverently than Bach.  No one, on\r\n      the other hand, was more readily fired by a particular word or image\r\n      in his text to give it sometimes irrelevant expression.\r\n\r\n  164 Of Bach’s church Cantatas 206 have survived.  In only 22 of them\r\n      does Bach fail to introduce movements based upon the Lutheran\r\n      Chorals.\r\n\r\n  165 We must attribute to Forkel’s general ignorance of Bach’s concerted\r\n      church music his failure to comment upon a much more remarkable\r\n      feature of the recitatives, namely, their unique treatment of the\r\n      human voice as a declamatory medium, a development as remarkable as\r\n      Wagner’s innovations in operatic form a century later.\r\n\r\n  166 It was not the imperfections of the choir but the indifference of\r\n      Bach’s successors at St. Thomas’, Leipzig, that was chiefly\r\n      responsible for the neglect of his Cantatas in the latter half of\r\n      the eighteenth century.  Johann Friedrich Doles (1716-89) was the\r\n      only Cantor who realised the greatness of his predecessor’s\r\n      concerted church music.\r\n\r\n  167 The _Trauer-Ode_ was performed on October 17, 1727.  Bach finished\r\n      the score two days before the performance!  A parallel case is that\r\n      of Mozart, who finished the overture of _Don Giovanni_ on the\r\n      morning of the first performance of the Opera, and actually played\r\n      it unrehearsed that evening.\r\n\r\n  168 It has been pointed out already that Bach used the _St. Matthew\r\n      Passion_ music, set to other words, for the occasion. No. 26 (“I\r\n      would beside my Lord be watching”) was sung to the words “Go,\r\n      Leopold, to thy rest”!\r\n\r\n  169 Of the 206 surviving Cantatas, 172 were written for the Leipzig\r\n      choir.\r\n\r\n  170 Forkel’s knowledge is very incomplete.\r\n\r\n  171 Elsewhere Forkel mentions only one of the secular Cantatas.\r\n\r\n  172 There is a tradition that Bach wrote a comic song, _Ihr Schönen,\r\n      höret an,_ which was widely current about the time of his death\r\n      (Spitta, iii. 181 n.). The Aria, _So oft ich meine Tabakspfeife,_ in\r\n      A. M. Bach’s _Notenbuch_ of 1725, should be mentioned.  See B. G.\r\n      xxxix. sec. 4.\r\n\r\n  173 Bach’s method has come down to us in treatises by two of his pupils,\r\n      C. P. E. Bach’s _Essay_ and Kirnberger’s _Die Kunst des reinen\r\n      Satzes in der Musik,_ to which reference has been made already.\r\n\r\n  174 Supra, p. 60.\r\n\r\n  175 Bach wrote eighteen Preludes for Beginners.  They are all in P. bk.\r\n      200.\r\n\r\n  176 Most of these movements, which Bach called indifferently\r\n      “Inventions” (ideas) and “Praeambula” (Preludes), were written in\r\n      1723. They are in P. bk. 201.\r\n\r\n  177 Heinrich Nikolaus Gerber, who was Bach’s pupil from 1724 to 1727,\r\n      particularly emphasises this feature of Bach’s teaching.\r\n\r\n  178 See on the whole matter Spitta, iii. 117 ff. Bach’s method is\r\n      illustrated by his _Rules and Instructions_ (1738) printed by\r\n      Spitta, iii. 315 ff., and also by the _Einige höchst nöthinge\r\n      Regeln_ at the end of A. M. Bach’s _Notenbuch_ (1725).\r\n\r\n  179 Mozart wrote as follows to a correspondent who asked him what his\r\n      method of composition was: “I can really say no more on this subject\r\n      than the following; for I myself know no more about it, and cannot\r\n      account for it. When I am, as it were, completely myself, entirely\r\n      alone, and of good cheer—say, travelling in a carriage, or walking\r\n      after a good meal, or during the night when I cannot sleep; it is on\r\n      such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly. _Whence_\r\n      and _how_ they come, I know not; nor can I force them. Those ideas\r\n      that please me I retain in memory, and am accustomed, as I have been\r\n      told, to hum them to myself.  If I continue in this way, it soon\r\n      occurs to me how I may turn this or that morsel to account, so as to\r\n      make a good dish of it, that is to say, agreeably to the rules of\r\n      counterpoint, to the peculiarities of the various instruments, etc.\r\n      All this fires my soul, and, provided I am not disturbed, my subject\r\n      enlarges itself, becomes methodised and defined, and the whole,\r\n      though it be long, stands almost complete and finished in my mind,\r\n      so that I can survey it, like a fine picture or a beautiful statue,\r\n      at a glance.  Nor do I hear in my imagination the parts\r\n      successively, but I hear them, as it were, all together.  What a\r\n      delight this is I cannot tell!…When I proceed to write down my\r\n      ideas, I take out of the bag of my memory, if I may use that phrase,\r\n      what has previously been collected into it in the way I have\r\n      mentioned.  For this reason the committing to paper is done quickly\r\n      enough, for everything is, as I said before, already finished; and\r\n      it rarely differs on paper from what it was in my imagination”\r\n      (Life, ed. Dent, p. 255).\r\n\r\n      Wagner, writing in 1851 to Uhlig, who could not understand how the\r\n      libretto of _Young Siegfried_ could be set to music, expresses the\r\n      same idea as Mozart: “What you cannot possibly imagine is a-making\r\n      of itself!  I tell you, the musical phrases build themselves on\r\n      these verses and periods without my having to trouble at all;\r\n      everything springs as if wild from the ground” (Life, trans. Ellis,\r\n      iii. p. 243).\r\n\r\n      Schumann writes in 1839: “I used to rack my brains for a long time,\r\n      but now I scarcely ever scratch out a note.  It all comes from\r\n      within, and I often feel as if I could go on playing without ever\r\n      coming to an end” (Grove, vol. iv. p. 353).\r\n\r\n  180 Angela Berardi’s _Documenti armonici. Nelli quali con varii\r\n      discorsi, regole, ed essempii si dimonstrano gli studii arteficiosi\r\n      della musica_ was published at Bologna in 1687.\r\n\r\n  181 Giovanni Maria Buononcini, b. c. 1640, d. 1678; Maestro di Capella\r\n      at Modena; published his _Musico prattico_ at Bologna in 1673, 1688.\r\n\r\n  182 Johann Joseph Fux, b. 1660, d. 1741; Kapellmeister at Vienna;\r\n      published his _Gradus ad Parnassum_ at Vienna in 1725.\r\n\r\n  183 See supra, p. 74.\r\n\r\n  184 * I speak here only of those pupils who made music their profession.\r\n      But, besides these, Bach had a great many other pupils.  Every\r\n      dilettante in the neighbourhood desired to boast of the instruction\r\n      of so great and celebrated a man.  Many gave themselves out to have\r\n      been his pupils who had never been taught by him.\r\n\r\n  185 See Spitta, i. 522; Schweitzer, i. 214 for farther details regarding\r\n      Vogler, who died circ. 1765.\r\n\r\n  186 Gottfried August Homilius, b. 1714, d. 1785; pupil of Bach, circ.\r\n      1735.  Cantor of the Kreuzschule, Dresden.\r\n\r\n  187 Christoph Transchel (1721-1800) taught music at Leipzig and Dresden;\r\n      Bach’s pupil and friend, circ. 1742.  See Spitta, iii. 245.\r\n\r\n  188 Johann Gottlieb (or Theophilus) Goldberg, clavicenist to Count\r\n      Kaiserling (infra, p. 119) for whom Bach wrote the so-called\r\n      _Goldberg Variations._ He was born circ. 1720 and was a pupil of\r\n      Bach from 1733-46.\r\n\r\n  189 Johann Ludwig Krebs, b. 1713, d. 1780; Bach’s pupil, 1726-35. Bach\r\n      said of him that he was “the best crab (Krebs) in the brook (Bach).”\r\n\r\n  190 Johann Christoph Altnikol, d. 1759.\r\n\r\n  191 Johann Friedrich Agricola, b. 1720, d. 1774; pupil of Bach circ.\r\n      1738-41; Director of the Royal Chapel, Berlin.\r\n\r\n  192 Pier Francesco Tosi, b. circ. 1650; singing master in London. His\r\n      _Opinioni de’ canton antichi e moderni, o sieno osservazioni sopra\r\n      il canto figurato_ was published at Bologna in 1723.\r\n\r\n  193 Johann Gottfried Müthel, b. circ. 1720, d. circ. 1790; pupil of Bach\r\n      in 1750 and resident in his house at the time of his death; organist\r\n      of the Lutheran Church, Riga.\r\n\r\n  194 Johann Philipp Kirnberger, b. 1721, d. 1783; Bach’s pupil, 1739-41.\r\n\r\n  195 Louisa Amalia, of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, wife of Frederick the\r\n      Great’s brother, and mother of his successor, Frederick William II.\r\n      (1786-97).\r\n\r\n  196 The second work was published in 1773 at Berlin. For the first, see\r\n      supra, p. 74.\r\n\r\n  197 Johann Christian Kittel, b. 1732, d. 1809; one of Bach’s latest\r\n      pupils; Organist of the Predigerkirche, Erfurt.  He is said to have\r\n      possessed a portrait of his master and to have rewarded his pupils\r\n      for good playing by drawing the curtain which usually covered the\r\n      picture and permitting them to look upon it.  It is, perhaps, the\r\n      portrait, recently discovered by Dr. Fritz Volbach, which is\r\n      reproduced at p. 92 of this volume.\r\n\r\n  198 Nothing seems to be known of him.\r\n\r\n  199 Johann Martin Schubart succeeded Bach at Weimar in 1717.  He was\r\n      born in 1690 and died in 1721. See Spitta, i. 343.\r\n\r\n  200 In addition to those mentioned by Forkel, the following pupils of\r\n      Bach are known: Johann Gotthilf Ziegler, of St. Ulrich’s Church,\r\n      Halle; J. Bernhard Bach, of Ohrdruf; Heinrich Nikolaus Gerber,\r\n      Organist at Sondershausen; Samuel Anton Bach, of Meiningen; Johann\r\n      Ernst Bach, of Saxe-Weimar; Johann Elias Bach, Cantor at\r\n      Schweinfurt; Johann Tobias Krebs, organist at Buttelstädt, and his\r\n      sons, Johann Ludwig, Johann Tobias, and Johann Carl; Johann\r\n      Schneider, organist of St. Nicolas’, Leipzig; Georg Friedrich\r\n      Einicke, Cantor at Frankenhausen; Johann Friedrich Doles, Bach’s\r\n      second successor in the Cantorate of St. Thomas’; Rudolph Straube,\r\n      who afterwards settled in England; Christoph Nichelmann, cembalist\r\n      to Frederick the Great; Christian Gräbner, and Carl Hartwig.\r\n\r\n      For full information upon Bach’s pupils see Spitta, i. 522 ff., ii.\r\n      47 ff., iii. 116 ff., 239 ff., and the relative articles in Grove’s\r\n      _Dictionary._\r\n\r\n  201 Forkel does not do justice to his friend.  C. P. E. Bach is\r\n      recognised as the immediate precursor of Haydn and as the link\r\n      between the latter and J. S. Bach.\r\n\r\n  202 Mozart had a very particular regard for him.  See Schweitzer i. 220\r\n      on his brothers’ abilities as composers.\r\n\r\n  203 Spitta (iii. 262) quotes a characteristic anecdote.  To some one who\r\n      praised his skill on the Organ Bach replied: “There is nothing\r\n      wonderful about it.  You merely strike the right note at the right\r\n      moment and the Organ does the rest.”\r\n\r\n  204 See supra, p. 19.  Bach himself certainly was the challenger.\r\n\r\n  205 When Handel was at Venice in 1708, Domenico Scarlatti, hearing a\r\n      stranger touching the Harpsichord at a masquerade, exclaimed, “That\r\n      must either be the famous Saxon or the Devil” (Rockstro’s _George\r\n      Frederick Handel,_ p. 48).  Streatfield (p. 145) mentions a similar\r\n      event which took place in 1737.  Hearing a stranger playing a Fugue\r\n      in one of the Flemish churches, the organist embraced him, saying,\r\n      “You can be no other but the great Handel.”\r\n\r\n  206 Heinrich Lorenz Hurlebusch was organist of three churches in\r\n      Brunswick.  His visit to Bach took place in 1730, seemingly.  See\r\n      Schweitzer, i. 154.\r\n\r\n  207 Schweitzer prints an appreciation of Hurlebusch which suggests that\r\n      he was a man of distinct ability and “a paragon of politeness.”\r\n\r\n  208 Antonio Caldara, b. circ. 1670; vice-Kapellmeister at Vienna,\r\n      1716-36; d. 1736.\r\n\r\n  209 Johann Adolph Hasse, b. 1699, d. 1783; Kapellmeister and Director of\r\n      the Opera, Dresden.\r\n\r\n  210 Johann Gottlieb Graun, b. circ. 1698, d. 1771; conductor of the\r\n      royal Kapelle, Berlin.\r\n\r\n      Carl Heinrich Graun, b. 1701, d. 1759; like his brother, in\r\n      Frederick the Great’s service.\r\n\r\n  211 Georg Philipp Telemann, b. 1681, d. 1767; Cantor and Musik-direktor\r\n      in Hamburg.\r\n\r\n  212 Johann Dismas Zelenka, b. 1679 or 1681, d. 1745; Court Composer at\r\n      Dresden.\r\n\r\n  213 Franz Benda, b. 1709, d. 1786; Concertmeister to Frederick the Great\r\n      upon the death of J. G. Graun.\r\n\r\n  214 On Telemann’s influence on Bach see Spitta, ii. 437.\r\n\r\n  215 Handel’s second visit to Halle took place in June 1729.  His\r\n      mother’s illness detained him.  See Streatfield, p. 110.\r\n\r\n  216 Handel’s third visit took place in July-August 1760.  He was laid up\r\n      by a severe accident in the course of it, and appears to have not\r\n      recovered from it at the time of Bach’s death.\r\n\r\n  217 Faustina Bordoni, b. 1693, d. 1783; m. Hasse in 1730.  She was one\r\n      of the most famous singers of the day.\r\n\r\n  218 The original has “Liederchen.”\r\n\r\n  219 See supra, p. 37.  Compare Handel’s case.  He received a royal\r\n      pension of £600 per annum, and though he was twice a bankrupt, left\r\n      £20,000.\r\n\r\n  220 The Duke was the nephew of, and succeeded, Duke Wilhelm Ernst in\r\n      1728.\r\n\r\n  221 The Canonic Variations on the melody are published by Novello bk.\r\n      19, p. 73. For the Mizler Society, see supra, p. xxiv.\r\n\r\n  222 Spitta (iii. 294) regards the statement as incorrect and holds that\r\n      the work was engraved before Bach joined Mizler’s Society in June\r\n      1747.  Pirro (p. 215) supports Spitta and regards the Variations as\r\n      having been engraved at Nürnberg “vers 1746.”\r\n\r\n  223 The first of Bach’s works to be engraved was the Mühlhausen Cantata,\r\n      _Gott ist mein König,_ (parts only).  It was published in 1708, when\r\n      Bach was twenty-three years old.  Forkel refers to Partita I. in the\r\n      first Part of the _Clavierübung_ (P. bk. 205 p. 4).  It was engraved\r\n      in 1726, when Bach was forty-one years old.  In 1731 he republished\r\n      it, with five others that had appeared in the interval, in the first\r\n      Part of the _Clavierübung_ (P. bks. 205, 206).\r\n\r\n  224 Forkel’s rather casual critical axioms seem to be as follows:\r\n      “Publication postulates excellence”; “An amended MS. implies that\r\n      the original text was not a finished work of art.”\r\n\r\n  225 It was the first work engraved by Bach himself, though the parts of\r\n      the Cantata  _Gott ist mein König_ had been published by the Town\r\n      Council at Mühlhausen in 1708.\r\n\r\n  226 The work was published at Leipzig “in Commission bey Boetii Seel,\r\n      hinderlassenen Tochter, unter den Rath-hause.”  The Suites, or\r\n      Partitas (P. bks. 205, 206), are in B flat major, C minor, A minor,\r\n      D major, G major, E minor.\r\n\r\n  227 In 1801 Hoffmeister and Kühnel unsuccessfully attempted to publish\r\n      Bach’s works by subscription.\r\n\r\n  228 The Partita in B minor (P. bk. 208 p. 20).\r\n\r\n  229 The work was published in 1735.  The Italian Concerto in F major is\r\n      published by Novello and P. bk. 207.\r\n\r\n  230 The work appeared in 1739.  It was intended to contain works for the\r\n      Organ only; the four Duetti are incongruous and seem to have crept\r\n      in by mistake.  See the scheme of the work discussed in Terry,\r\n      _Bach’s Chorals,_ Part III.  The Choral Preludes are in Novello’s\r\n      ed., bk. xvi.\r\n\r\n  231 The work was published circ. 1747-50.  Five of the six movements\r\n      certainly, and the sixth with practical certainty, are adaptations\r\n      to the Organ of movements out of Bach’s Church Cantatas.  See Parry,\r\n      _Bach,_ p. 535.  The Chorals are in Novello’s ed., bk. xvi.\r\n\r\n  232 See supra, p. 65.\r\n\r\n  233 Thus the pedal sounds above the part given to the second manual and\r\n      is often the topmost part.  See Novello’s ed., bk. xvi. 4.\r\n\r\n  234 Published circ. 1742; the so-called “Goldberg Variations.” They are\r\n      in P. bk. 209.\r\n\r\n  235 Variation No. 10 is a Fughetta in four parts.\r\n\r\n  236 Ten of the Variations are marked “a 2 Clav.,” that is, for two\r\n      keyboards or manuals: Nos. 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28.\r\n      Nos. 5, 7, 29 are marked “a 1 ovvero 2 Clav.”\r\n\r\n  237 The movement is constructed upon two merry folk-songs, _Kraut and\r\n      Rüben haben mich vertrieben,_ and _Ich bin so lang nicht bei dir\r\n      gewirt_.\r\n\r\n  238 See supra, p. 101.\r\n\r\n  239 In fact Bach wrote the early _Aria variata alla maniera Italiana_\r\n      (Peters bk. 215, p. 12) for the Clavier.  For the Organ he wrote\r\n      four sets of Variations upon as many Choral melodies (Novello bk.\r\n      xix.).  But all except the Goldberg Variations are youthful works,\r\n      and in his maturity Bach clearly had no liking for the form.  The\r\n      theme of the Goldberg Variations, moreover, is itself a youthful\r\n      idea; at least it dates back to as early as 1725, and is found in A.\r\n      M. Bach’s _Notenbuch_ (No. 26, Aria in G major).\r\n\r\n  240 There is no reference to these corrigenda in the B. G. edition.\r\n\r\n  241 The work has been referred to already in connection with Bach’s\r\n      membership of Mizler’s Society (supra, p. 112).  It was composed\r\n      presumably circ. 1746 and in point of technical skill is the most\r\n      brilliant of Bach’s instrumental works.  Forkel states that it was\r\n      engraved after June 1747, when Bach joined Mizler’s Society.  Spitta\r\n      (iii. 295) is of opinion that it was already engraved by then.  It\r\n      is in bk. xix. of Novello’s edition.\r\n\r\n  242 Supra, p. 25.\r\n\r\n  243 The presentation copy of the work, which Bach sent to Frederick\r\n      along with a dedicatory letter (July 7, 1747), is in the Berlin\r\n      Amalienbibliothek and proves that only the first third of the work,\r\n      as far as the “Ricercare a sei voci” (see B.G. XXXI. (2)) was sent\r\n      then.  The latter and the remaining canons were dispatched\r\n      subsequently probably by the hand of C. P. E. Bach.  The six-part\r\n      Ricercare was a particular compliment to the King.  Frederick had\r\n      desired Bach on his visit to play a Fugue in six parts but left it\r\n      to the player to select his theme.  Bach now employed the thema\r\n      regium for the purpose.  The first reissue of the work was by\r\n      Breitkopf and Haertel in 1832. Peters (bk. 219) brought it out in\r\n      1866. See Schweitzer, i. 417 IV. and Spitta, iii. 191 ff. and 292.\r\n\r\n  244 In C minor (P. bk. 237 p. 3).\r\n\r\n  245 The statement is inaccurate.  The work was written for the most part\r\n      in 1749 and the greater part of it was prepared for engraving by\r\n      Bach himself during his last illness.  None of his elder sons was\r\n      with him at his death, and the blunders that disfigure the engraved\r\n      copy show that they clumsily finished their father’s work.  It is in\r\n      P. bk. 218.\r\n\r\n  246 Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg, b. 1718, d. 1795.\r\n\r\n  247 The work was published shortly after Bach’s death, but had no sale.\r\n      C. P. E. Bach then commissioned Marpurg to write a preface, and the\r\n      new edition was published at the Leipzig Fair, Easter, 1762.  In\r\n      four years only about thirty copies were sold. See Spitta, iii. 197\r\n      ff. and Schweitzer, i. 423 ff.\r\n\r\n  248 In 1756.  See C. P. E. Bach’s advertisement in Felix Grenier, p.\r\n      232.\r\n\r\n  249 The work contains six Fugues and four canons upon the same theme; an\r\n      unfinished Fugue “a tre soggetti,” the first four notes of the third\r\n      of which spell B A C H; and the Choral Prelude “Wenn wir in höchsten\r\n      Nöthen sein.”\r\n\r\n  250 Schweitzer explains: “His purpose in this work being a purely\r\n      theoretical one, Bach writes the Fugues out in score, and calls them\r\n      ‘counterpoints’ ”\r\n\r\n                [  251 B A C H in German musical notation]\r\n\r\n  252 Supra, p. 27.  The movement is in N. bk. 17 p. 85.  It is not\r\n      certain that Bach intended the Prelude or the unfinished Fugue to be\r\n      included.\r\n\r\n  253 C. P. E. Bach was only concerned with the first volume.  Erk, in his\r\n      edition of the _Choralgesänge,_ conjectures that Kirnberger was\r\n      responsible for the second.\r\n\r\n  254 The four volumes were published at Leipzig between 1784-87.  Spitta\r\n      states that C. P. E. Bach was the editor.  Erk joins Kirnberger with\r\n      him in that position.  As C. P. E. Bach died in 1788 Kirnberger’s\r\n      association with the work is probable, especially if he had already\r\n      been responsible for the 1769 volume.\r\n\r\n  255 Bach’s Clavier school consisted of eighteen Preludes for beginners\r\n      (all in B.G. XXXVI.); the two-part and three-part Inventions; and\r\n      the _Well-tempered Clavier._  The six Preludes mentioned by Forkel,\r\n      and which alone he knew, were published by him for the first time.\r\n      Seven more are found in Wilhelm Friedemann’s _Clavierbüchlein_ (B.G.\r\n      XLV. (1)), and the remaining five have survived in texts handed down\r\n      by others of Bach’s pupils.  The eighteen are in P. bk. 200.\r\n\r\n  256 The Autograph was written at Cöthen and is dated 1723.  It also\r\n      contains the fifteen Symphonies, or three-part Inventions mentioned\r\n      in paragraph 3.  Both Inventions and Symphonies are in F. bk. 201.\r\n      According to Spitta (ii. 57 n.) the Inventions were published at\r\n      Leipzig in 1763.  See also Schweitzer, i. 328 ff.\r\n\r\n  257 See the previous note.\r\n\r\n  258 The second Part was compiled in 1744 and Bach’s Autograph of it,\r\n      though not the earliest Autograph, is in the British Museum.  See\r\n      Schweitzer, i. 331 ff. and Spitta, ii. 161 ff.  The whole work is in\r\n      P. bks. 1, 2; or 1a, 1b; or 2790a, 2790b.\r\n\r\n  259 No. 20. Spitta (ii. 164) attributes it to the years 1707 or 1708.\r\n      Schweitzer (i. 332) also regards it as a youthful piece written,\r\n      moreover, for the pedal Clavicembalo.\r\n\r\n  260 Nos. 15 and 16.  Spitta, admitting that the two do not rank with the\r\n      most interesting in the collection, finds no indication of their\r\n      being of different date from the best movements.\r\n\r\n  261 No. 1. Here Spitta (ii. 165 n.) challenges Forkel.\r\n\r\n  262 Nos. 11 and 12.  In regard to No. 12 (F minor) Spitta holds Forkel\r\n      to be in error.  As to No. 11, he expresses the same opinion as in\r\n      note 3, supra.\r\n\r\n  263 The date 1744 places the second Part among Bach’s latest\r\n      compositions.  On the other hand, like the first Part, it contained\r\n      work of earlier date.\r\n\r\n  264 Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue in D minor (P. bk. 207 p. 4).  It\r\n      probably dates from circ. 1720-23.\r\n\r\n  265 The MS. was discovered in 1876 and is now at Dresden. It was written\r\n      circ. 1738 and disproves Forkel’s conjecture that the fugue did not\r\n      belong to the Fantasia and is only partially by Bach.  The Fugue\r\n      contains forty-seven bars.  As the Autograph is a fair copy the\r\n      Fugue cannot be called unfinished.  See Spitta, iii. 182.  The\r\n      Fantasia is in P. bk. 207 p. 50; the Fugue in P. bk. 212 p. 88. See\r\n      B.C. xxxvi., xxxviii., and xlii. for other Clavier Fantasias.\r\n\r\n  266 The true explanation seems to be that the Prelude of the first Suite\r\n      (A major) is based upon a Gigue by Charles Dieupart (d. circ. 1740),\r\n      a popular teacher and composer in England.  The words fait pour les\r\n      Anglois, which head the A major Suite in an early MS., have been\r\n      wrongly interpreted as applying to the whole set of six.  They\r\n      merely indicate Dieupart’s borrowed Gigue. See Grove, vol. i. 701,\r\n      and Parry, _J. S. Bach,_ p. 463.  A copy of the work exists, of date\r\n      1724-27, made by one of Bach’s pupils.  But the composition of the\r\n      Suites may certainly be assigned to the Cöthen period.  They are\r\n      published in P. bks. 203, 204.\r\n\r\n  267 The French Suites undoubtedly date back to the Cöthen period, since\r\n      they figure, though incomplete, in the _Notenbuch_ of A. M. Bach\r\n      (1722). They are published in P. bk. 202.\r\n\r\n  268 Forkel’s incomplete catalogue may be compared with the\r\n      Bachgesellschaft volumes III., XIV., XXV. (1), XXXI. (2), XXXVI.,\r\n      XLIL, XLIII. (1 and 2), XLV. (1).  See generally Schweitzer, ch. 15,\r\n      and Pirro, pp. 218 ff.\r\n\r\n  269 P. bks. 205, 206, 208, 212 (fragment in F minor), 214, 215, 1959.\r\n\r\n  270 P. bks. 200, 210, 211, 212, 214, 215, 1959.\r\n\r\n  271 For the most part these youthful works will be found in B.G. XXXVI.\r\n\r\n  272 P. bk. 207 p. 16.\r\n\r\n  273 In C minor (P. bk. 200 p. 10).\r\n\r\n  274 In P. bks. 232, 233.\r\n\r\n  275 Suite in A major (P. bk. 236), Sonata in E minor (P. bk. 236), Fugue\r\n      in G minor (P. bk. 236), four Inventions (P. bk. 2957), Sonata in G\r\n      minor (BG. ix. 274; not in P.), Sonata in C major for 2 Violins and\r\n      Clavier (P. bk. 237).\r\n\r\n  276 There are six Sonatas for Flute and Clavier, in B minor, E flat\r\n      major, A minor, C major, E minor, E major (P. bks. 234, 235).\r\n\r\n  277 There are three Sonatas for Clavier and Gamba, in G major, D major,\r\n      G minor (P. bk. 239).\r\n\r\n  278 Forkel omits two Sonatas for Violin, Flute, and Clavier, in G major\r\n      and C minor (both in P. bk. 237).\r\n\r\n  279 As Forkol mentions in secs. 4, 5, 6 the Concertos for two, three,\r\n      and four Claviers, perhaps he had in mind here seven Concertos for\r\n      Clavier and Orchestra (P. bks. 248-254).  A Concerto for Clavier,\r\n      Violin, Flute, and Orchestra (P. bk. 255 p. 4) in A minor also\r\n      should be mentioned.  Also an Overture, in G minor, for Clavier and\r\n      Strings (B.G. XLV. (1) p. 190; not in P.)\r\n\r\n  280 P. bk. 257 p. 4.\r\n\r\n  281 P. bk. 256 p. 4.\r\n\r\n  282 There are, in fact, three Concertos for two Claviers and Orchestra:\r\n      two in C minor and one in C major.  Forkel refers to only one of the\r\n      former and regards it as antiquated by comparison with the one in C\r\n      major.  Spitta (iii. 144) attributes the C major to 1730.  Forkel’s\r\n      C minor in its original form was a Concerto for two Violins, now\r\n      lost.  The other C minor Concerto is identical with the Concerto in\r\n      D minor for two Violins and is in P. 257b. Spitta (iii. 138) dates\r\n      it 1736. See Schweitzer, i. 413.\r\n\r\n  283 In D minor and C major (P. bks. 258, 259).  The tradition is that\r\n      Bach wrote these two Concertos in order to play them with his elder\r\n      sons.  Spitta (iii. 144) finds the tradition trustworthy.  Hence the\r\n      two works must have been written by c. 1733 at latest, before the\r\n      sons left home.  See also Schweitzer, i. 414.\r\n\r\n  284 In A minor (P. bk. 260).  This is not an original composition, but\r\n      is an arrangement by Bach of a Vivaldi Concerto for four Violins.\r\n      Spitta (iii. 149) assigns it to the same period as the Concertos for\r\n      three Claviers, c. 1733.  See B.G. XLIII. (1) infra.\r\n\r\n  285 The pedal on the small German Organ had only the compass of an\r\n      octave.\r\n\r\n  286 The Great Preludes and Fugues are, with one exception, in B.G. XV.\r\n      The Prelude and Fugue in E flat was published by Bach in the third\r\n      Part of the _Clavierübung._  Its Fugue is known as the “St. Anne’s.”\r\n\r\n  287 From the figures printed by Forkel the twelve can be identified as\r\n      follows (the references in parentheses are to the Novello edition of\r\n      Bach’s Organ works):\r\n\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in C minor, the “Great” (bk. vii. 64).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in A minor, (bk. vii. 42).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in G major, (bk. viii. 112).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in E minor, (bk. viii. 98).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in B minor, (vii. 52).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in C major, (bk. ix. 156).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in D minor, (bk. ix. 150).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in C major (bk iii. 70).\r\n            Tocatta and Fugue in D minor (bk. x. 196).\r\n            Tocatta and Fugue in F major (bk. ix. 176).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in G minor (bk. viii. 120).\r\n            Prelude and Fugue in E minor (bk. ii. 44).\r\n\r\n  288 The Passacaglia in C minor (Novello bk. 10 p. 214) was written\r\n      originally for the Clavicembalo and pedal.  It belongs to the later\r\n      Weimar period, i.e. circ. 1715.  See Spitta, i. 588 and Schweitzer,\r\n      i. 280.\r\n\r\n  289 They are all printed in Novello bk. 19, and are three in number, on\r\n      the melodies “Christ, der du bist der helle Tag”, “O Gott, du\r\n      frommer Gott,” and “Sei gegrüsset, Jesu gütig.”  The pedal is only\r\n      required in one movement of the first, in none of the second, and\r\n      considerably in the third.  Without question all three date from\r\n      Bach’s earliest period, but whether they were written at Arnstadt or\r\n      Lüneburg cannot be stated.\r\n\r\n  290 The fullest collection of these miscellaneous Organ Choral Preludes\r\n      is in B.G. XL. Not counting variant readings they number fifty-two,\r\n      besides two fragments and thirteen of doubtful authenticity, of\r\n      which two are sets of Variations.  The Novello edition contains\r\n      fifty-two in bks. 18 and 19.  To these must be added the “Eighteen”\r\n      Preludes on Choral Melodies, which Forkel nowhere mentions, as well\r\n      as the third Part of the _Clavierübung,_ the _Schübler Chorals,_ and\r\n      the Variations on _Vom Himmel hoch,_ to which he has already made\r\n      reference in the first section of this chapter.  As he does not\r\n      mention it specifically, it is to be inferred that Forkel was\r\n      ignorant of the existence of the _Orgelbüchlein_; otherwise he could\r\n      hardly have failed to introduce it in this section.  All Bach’s\r\n      Choral Preludes, miscellaneous and in collections made by himself,\r\n      are in Novello’s edition, bks. 15-19.  A useful key to their\r\n      melodies is provided by bk. 20.  For more detailed information see\r\n      Terry, _Bach’s Chorals,_ Part III.\r\n\r\n  291 The large number of MSS. of many of the miscellaneous Preludes is\r\n      made evident in the introduction to B.G. XL.\r\n\r\n  292 The Sonatas in E flat major, C minor, and D minor are in N. bk. 4; E\r\n      minor, C major, G major in N. bk. 5.\r\n\r\n  293 The so-called “Sonatas” were actually written for a Clavicembalo\r\n      with two manuals and a pedal.  Bach’s Autograph of them belonged to\r\n      his second son and an earlier copy of them to Wilhelm Friedemann.\r\n      Both are now in the Berlin Royal Library.  Friedemann went to\r\n      Dresden as Organist in 1733 and Spitta is of opinion that the whole\r\n      of the six Sonatas were in existence by or soon after 1727.  If so,\r\n      they must be regarded as the outcome of Bach’s early years at\r\n      Leipzig.  See Spitta, iii. 212 ff. and Schweitzer, i. 278.\r\n\r\n  294 None are extant.  Spitta, iii. 213 n., conjectures that Forkel\r\n      refers to the Trios in D minor and C minor (N. bks. 2 p. 54, 12 p.\r\n      108) and the Pastorale in F major (N. bk. 12 p. 102.) His incomplete\r\n      knowledge of the Organ works is revealed by Appendix V. infra.\r\n\r\n  295 This is a pure conjecture and Schweitzer scouts it (i. 416 n.).\r\n\r\n  296 The oldest copy of them dates from circ. 1720; they belong therefore\r\n      to the late Cöthen period.  The 1720 MS. is in A. M. Bach’s\r\n      handwriting and was discovered in 1814 at Petrograd among old papers\r\n      about to be sent away to a butter dealer.  The Sonatas are in P. bk.\r\n      228.\r\n\r\n  297 They also date from the Cöthen period and are in P. bk. 238a, 238b.\r\n\r\n  298 Forkel omits to mention the Brandenburg Concertos (P. bks. 261-266);\r\n      the Overtures in C major (P. bk. 267), B minor (P. bk. 268), D major\r\n      (P. bk. 269), D major (P. bk. 2068); and the Violin Concertos in A\r\n      minor (P. bk. 229), E major (P. bk. 230), and (for two Violins) in D\r\n      minor (P. bk. 231). In B.G. XXI. (1) is a Symphonic movement, in D\r\n      major, for Violin and orchestra.  A Sinfonia in F major (B.G. XXXI.\r\n      96) is another version of the first Brandenburg Concerto.  The\r\n      Clavier Concertos have been mentioned supra.\r\n\r\n  299 The set of five is complete only for Christmas Day, Feast of the\r\n      Circumcision, Whitsunday (one of the five is of doubtful\r\n      authenticity), Purification of the B.V.M., and Feast of St. Michael\r\n      the Archangel.  See Terry, _Bach’s Chorals,_ Part II. 2 ff.\r\n\r\n  300 In giving the number of _Passions_ as five, Forkel repeats the\r\n      statement of the _Nekrolog._  The number corresponds with the five\r\n      sets of Church Cantatas which Bach is known to have written.  It is,\r\n      however, exceedingly doubtful whether Bach wrote more than four\r\n      _Passions._  Only those according to St. Matthew and St. John have\r\n      come down to us from C. P. E. Bach, who was left the Autographs of\r\n      both by his father.  The _St. John Passion_ was first performed in\r\n      1724 and the _St. Matthew Passion_ in 1729. Picander, Bach’s\r\n      librettist, certainly wrote two other Passion texts, one of which\r\n      was written for Good Friday 1725, and the second, based on St.\r\n      Mark’s Gospel, was actually performed at St. Thomas’, Leipzig, on\r\n      Good Friday 1731.  Spitta (ii. 505) gives good reason to hold that\r\n      Bach’s music for this Passion was adapted from the _Trauer-Ode,_\r\n      which he had written in 1727 in memory of Queen Christiane\r\n      Eberhardine.  But of the 1725 _Passion_ there is no trace.  If it\r\n      ever existed, its loss probably may be assigned to Wilhelm\r\n      Friedemann’s carelessness, to whom presumably it was assigned in the\r\n      division of Bach’s property after his death.  But even so, we have\r\n      no more than four _Passions._ There exists, however, a fifth\r\n      _Passion according to St. Luke,_ which is undoubtedly in Bach’s\r\n      Autograph, and which Spitta is inclined to attribute to Bach\r\n      himself.  It is published by Breitkopf and Haertel, but is generally\r\n      regarded as being by another composer than Bach, who probably copied\r\n      it for use at Leipzig.  On the whole matter see Spitta, ii. 504 ff.,\r\n      Schweitzer, chap. xxvi., and the Bach-Jahrbuch for 1911\r\n      (Publications of the New Bachgesellschaft XII. (2)).\r\n\r\n  301 Other than the _Passions,_ the only Oratorios are the _Christmas\r\n      Oratorio_, (1734), the _Easter Oratorio_ (c. 1736), and _Ascension\r\n      Oratorio_ (c. 1735).\r\n\r\n  302 Besides the B minor Mass (1733-? 38) Bach wrote four miscalled\r\n      “short” Masses, in F major, A major, G minor, and G major.  They all\r\n      belong to the Leipzig period (c. 1739).\r\n\r\n  303 Besides the setting of the Sanctus in the B minor Mass there are\r\n      four detached settings, in C major, D major, D minor, and G major.\r\n      Of these only that in D major is probably by Bach (c. 1723).\r\n\r\n  304 The music for Saints’ Days is included in the church Cantatas.  For\r\n      the Birthday Odes see supra, Chap. IIA.\r\n\r\n  305 Besides the _Trauer-Ode,_ three or four of the church Cantatas and\r\n      certainly three of the Motets were written for funerals.  See Terry,\r\n      op. cit., pp. 24, 44.\r\n\r\n  306 Among the church Cantatas there are at least five for use at\r\n      weddings.  Bach wrote also three secular wedding Cantatas: _Weichet\r\n      nur, betrübte Schatten_ (c. 1730); _O holder Tag_ (11749); the third\r\n      (1728) has disappeared.\r\n\r\n  307 Two Italian Cantatas—_Amore traditore_ and _Non sa che sia\r\n      dolore_—have come down to us.  A third, _Andro dall colle al prato,_\r\n      is lost.  See B.G. XI. (ii.), XXIX.\r\n\r\n  308 Only six are genuine. See infra, p. 141.\r\n\r\n  309 Of the Motets that have come down to us as his, only six are Bach’s.\r\n      Forkel mentions five of them in secs. 7 and 3 of the next paragraph;\r\n      he omits _Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden._  In 1802-3 Breitkopf and\r\n      Haertel published six Motets—the five mentioned by Forkel and\r\n      another, _Ich lasse dich nicht,_ of which Bach made a copy, but\r\n      whose composer actually was Johann Christoph Bach.  We know that\r\n      Bach composed at least one Latin Motet for double chorus, and\r\n      Friedemann’s share of his father’s autographs may have contained it\r\n      and others known to Forkel but no longer extant.\r\n\r\n  310 The Amalienbibliothek of the Joachimsthal Gymnasium, Berlin,\r\n      contains one of the most important Bach collections, but it has long\r\n      been superseded by the Royal Library there as the chief repository\r\n      of Bach’s Autographs.\r\n\r\n  311 The Amalienbibliothek has only one Autograph, namely, Cantata 34, _O\r\n      ewiges Feuer._ The rest are early copies.\r\n\r\n  312 Cantata 53.  No Autograph of this Cantata exists, and the copies\r\n      from which the B.G. edition was printed are in the\r\n      Amalienbibliothek.\r\n\r\n  313 On the contrary, the Cantata belongs to the Leipzig period, 1723-34.\r\n\r\n  314 None of the four “short” Masses is in five parts.  All have\r\n      instrumental accompaniments.  The autograph scores of the Masses in\r\n      A major and G major are in Messrs. Breitkopf and Haertel’s\r\n      possession.  Copies of the other two scores, in Altnikol’s\r\n      handwriting, are in the Berlin Royal Library.  See Introduction to\r\n      B.G. VIII.\r\n\r\n  315 An eight-part Mass in G was performed at a Leipzig Gewandhaus\r\n      Concert on March 7, 1805, and was published later in the year by\r\n      Breitkopf and Haertel.  The score is admittedly, for the greater\r\n      part of the work, in Bach’s hand and is in the Berlin Royal Library.\r\n      The publication of the work was under consideration by the\r\n      Bachgesellschaft in 1858.  That it is not by Bach is generally held.\r\n      It has been attributed to Johann Ludwig Bach (d. 1741).  See\r\n      Genealogical Table II.\r\n\r\n  316 The _St. Matthew Passion._\r\n\r\n  317 A nom de plume for Christian Friedrich Henrici (1700-64), who wrote\r\n      a large number of Bach’s Leipzig texts.\r\n\r\n  318 Perhaps Forkel indicates the short _Sanctus_ in Richter’s edition of\r\n      the _Choralgesänge_, No. 123, or that in B.G. XLI. p. 177.\r\n\r\n  319 This is the first Chorus of Cantata No. 38.  It is printed as a\r\n      separate Motet in Erk, No. 150.\r\n\r\n  320 Forkel’s list is complete except for _Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden._\r\n\r\n  321 The opening Chorus of Cantata 144.\r\n\r\n  322 Forkel refers to the _Peasant Cantata,_ or _Mer hahn en neue\r\n      Oberkeet,_ performed on August 30, 1742.  Forkel clearly was not\r\n      familiar with Bach’s other secular Cantatas.  See B.G. XI. (ii.),\r\n      XX. (ii.), XXIX.  The Autograph score of the Peasant Cantata is in\r\n      the Berlin Royal Library.\r\n\r\n  323 Forkel’s suggestion was carried out, with varying thoroughness, in\r\n      the Bachgesellschaft edition.\r\n\r\n  324 Forkel’s judgment is at fault.  See Schweitzer, i. 336.\r\n\r\n  325 Also in Wilhelm Friedemann’s _Clavierbüchlein._  See Schweitzer, i.\r\n      279; Spitta, ii. 166.\r\n\r\n  326 “Since you cannot please everybody by your actions and work, strive\r\n      at least to satisfy a few; popular appreciation encourages bad\r\n      art.”—Schiller’s _ Votiftafeln_\r\n\r\n  327 The Cantatas are classified under Appendix II.\r\n\r\n  328 The references are to Peters’ edition.  Excepting bk. 1959, which\r\n      contains pieces of doubtful authenticity, every number printed by\r\n      Peters is entered in the Chronological Catalogue.\r\n\r\n  329 There are three other Sonatas, in A minor, C major, D minor, none of\r\n      which is an original composition.  They are printed in P. bk. 213.\r\n      The first and second are adaptations of material in Reinken’s\r\n      _Hortus Musicus._  The third is a transcription of the second Solo\r\n      Sonata for Violin.\r\n\r\n  330 The references are to Novello’s twelve Books of Bach’s Organ Works,\r\n      edited by J. F. Bridge and J. Higgs.  The edition is complete, and\r\n      contains every movement included in Alfred Dorffel’s “Thematisohos\r\n      Verzeichniss” (second edition, 1882) except his No. 24 on p. 72;\r\n      Nos. 6 and 8 on page 85; the “Kleines harmonisches Labyrinth”\r\n      (Dörffel, p. 88, tigs. 131-33), the genuineness of which is\r\n      questioned by Spitta (ii. 43); and figs. 136-37 on p. 88.  The\r\n      Novello edition also follows Rust, against Spitta’s judgment, in\r\n      printing the “Fantasia con Imitazione” (bk. 12 p. 71) as an Organ\r\n      instead of as a Clavier piece.  Books 15-19 print the Choral\r\n      Preludes.  See the Peters and Novello editions collated in Appendix\r\n      V.\r\n\r\n  331 Printed as a “Toccata” in E major in B.G. XV. p. 276.\r\n\r\n  332 Spitta (ii. 620, 718) mentions a Birthday Cantata written in\r\n      1717-1721(?), the title of which is lost.\r\n\r\n  333 The references are to Peters’ edition.\r\n\r\n  334 The D minor contains the famous Chaconne.\r\n\r\n  335 The references are to Peters’ edition. In the B.G. edition the\r\n      Orchestral music is included in the Chamber Music volumes.\r\n\r\n  336 Pirro, p. 228, holds that the first two (C major and B minor) were\r\n      written at Cöthen and the last two (D major and D major) at Leipzig.\r\n      Schweitzer (i. 402) regards it as not clear in which period the\r\n      Overtures were written.\r\n\r\n  337 In A minor, E major, G major. The G major figures as the fourth\r\n      Brandenburg (bk. 264) and as the Clavier Concerto in F major (bk.\r\n      248). The A minor and E major were also converted into Clavier\r\n      Concerti (G minor and D major) (bks. 249, 251). The D minor Clavier\r\n      Concerto (bk. 264) preserves a lost Violin Concerto in the same key,\r\n      and the one in F minor (bk. 250) corresponds with a lost Violin\r\n      Concerto in G minor (bks. 3068, 3069).\r\n\r\n  338 Also arranged as a Concerto for two Claviers (C minor) in P. bk.\r\n      257b.\r\n\r\n  339 Bach wrote another Magnificat, the music of which is lost. See\r\n      Spitta, ii. 374.\r\n\r\n  340 All except the Sanctus in D major are of doubtful authenticity. See\r\n      Schweitzer, ii. 328 and Spitta, iii. 41 n.\r\n\r\n  341 The Concerto in C minor (P. bk. 257) is an arrangement of one for\r\n      two Violins now lost. The third, also in C minor, is identical with\r\n      the D minor Concerto for two Violins and is published in that key in\r\n      the Peters edition.  The remaining Concerto, in C major, is the only\r\n      one originally written for the Clavier.  See Schweitzer, i. 413.\r\n\r\n  342 The work is an amplification of the Prelude and Fugue in A minor,\r\n      already catalogued among the Clavier works of the Cöthen period.\r\n      Schweitzer (i. 340) concludes that it was rearranged as an\r\n      orchestral Concerto early in the thirties, when Bach needed\r\n      Concertos for the Telemann Society’s Concerts.\r\n\r\n  343 The scheme of the G major and C major Preludes and Fugues dates back\r\n      to the Weimar period. See Spitta, iii. 208; Parry, p. 67.\r\n\r\n  344 These so-called “Organ” Sonatas were written for the Pedal\r\n      Clavicembalo.\r\n\r\n  345 The Clavier Suites in E minor, E major, and C minor are arrangements\r\n      of these, otherwise lost, Lute Partitas.

It consists of the Allegro, Adagio, Minuet, Trio I.\r\n      and Trio II. of the latter, and omits its second Allegro and\r\n      Polacca.\r\n\r\n  501 The Appendix contains Joh.

(2).\r\n\r\n  505 Another Allemande to the Suite is in B.G. XXXVI. 217 (also in P.).\r\n\r\n  506 The subject of the Fughetta is the same as that of Fugue No. 17 in\r\n      the second part of the “Well-tempered Clavier.”\r\n\r\n  507 The Prelude is No. 11 in Peters (B.G. xxxvi. 220). The Fughetta is\r\n      his No. 10. It is the same subject an that of Fugue 16 in the second\r\n      part of the “Well-tempered Clavier.” An alternative Prelude (P. 214\r\n      p. 78) is in the Appendix (p. 220).\r\n\r\n  508 They are described as “zur vierten französischen Suite.” The Prelude\r\n      is in P. bk. 1959 p. 67.\r\n\r\n  509 Written respectively for the second and third French Suites (not in\r\n      P.).\r\n\r\n  510 A fingered exercise.\r\n\r\n  511 The Appendices of the volume contain variant readings of movements\r\n      elsewhere contained in it, and of the first, third, and sixth\r\n      Preludes and Fugues in the second part of the “Well-tempered\r\n      Clavier.”\r\n\r\n  512 See B.G. XLV. (1) Appendix.\r\n\r\n  513 Only nos. 2 and 3 are derived from Vivaldi.\r\n\r\n  514 A variant text is in B.G. XLII. 282.\r\n\r\n  515 Vivaldi’s text of the first movement is in the Appendix (p. 229).\r\n\r\n  516 See B.G. XLIII. (2) sec. 1 no. 2.\r\n\r\n  517 The fugal subject is taken from the Allabreve.\r\n\r\n  518 Bach’s instrumental accompaniments are in the Appendix (p. 143).\r\n\r\n  519 C. P. E. Bach’s collection of his father’s Choral settings was\r\n      published by Immanuel Breitkopf in four volumes between the years\r\n      1784-87.  They are all inoluded in Breitkopf and Haertel’s edition\r\n      (1898) of Bach s “Choralgesänge”; the numerals in brackets in the\r\n      above list indicate the position of each Choral in that collection.\r\n      The latter includes also the simple four-part Chorals from the\r\n      Oratorios and Cantatas; hence the numeration of that volume and B.G.\r\n      XXXIX. is not uniform.\r\n\r\n  520 The bracket states the title by which the tune is better known.\r\n\r\n  521 The Chorals are taken from two sources, Anna Magdalena Bach’s\r\n      “Notenbuch” (1726; see B.G. XLIII. (2)), and Schemelli’s\r\n      “Musicalisches Gesang-Buch” (1736), of which Bach was the musical\r\n      editor.  The latter contains sixty-nine melodies (with figured\r\n      bass), the former seven: one melody (No. 14) is in both collections.\r\n      The Schemelli tunes are indicated by an S within a bracket after the\r\n      numeral.  One melody (No. 71) is indubitably by Bach himself.  It,\r\n      and others, which may be attributed to him on good evidence, are\r\n      marked by an asterisk.  The seventy-five settings are published in\r\n      practicable form by the N.B.G. I. (1) and I. (2).\r\n\r\n  522 Nos. 22 and 23 are the same tune.\r\n\r\n  523 For a discussion of Bach’s original hymn-tunes see the present\r\n      writer’s “Bach’s Chorals,” Part II. Introduction, pp. 67 ff. Six\r\n      more of Bach’s original hymn-tunes are printed there.\r\n\r\n  524 The first three Arias are published by Novello, and also by the\r\n      N.B.G. I. (1).\r\n\r\n  525 In the Royal Library, Berlin.  Kirnberger was a pupil of Bach.  See\r\n      section on Variants infra.\r\n\r\n  526 Novello omits the concluding four-part Choral.\r\n\r\n  527 The Prelude is also attributed to J. L. Krebs, a pupil of Bach.\r\n\r\n  528 See section on Variants infra.:\r\n\r\n  529 Variant, P. bk. 245 p. 106.\r\n\r\n  530 Ernst Naumann remarks, “Das Stück kann recht gut von Seb. Baoh\r\n      herrühren.” The text is complete, and the omission of the Prelude\r\n      from the Novello edition is to be regretted.\r\n\r\n  531 A transcription of the second Sonata for Solo Violin, in A minor,\r\n      See B.G. XXVII. (1).\r\n\r\n  532 A transcription of the third Partita, in E major, for Solo Violin.\r\n      See ibid.\r\n\r\n  533 From the third Sonata for Solo Violin, in C major. See ibid.\r\n\r\n  534 Both Sonatas are arrangements of instrumental Sonatas in J. A.\r\n      Reinken’s “Hortus Musicus.” See Spitta, i. 430.\r\n\r\n  535 Both Sonatas are arrangements of instrumental Sonatas in J. A.\r\n      Reinken’s “Hortus Musicus.” See Spitta, i. 430.\r\n\r\n  536 After a Sonata movement by J. A. Reinken.\r\n\r\n  537 After a Fugue by J. C. Erselius. The original is given in Anhang II.\r\n      of the volume.\r\n\r\n  538 Only Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14 are derived from Vivaldi. The others\r\n      are founded on Benedetto Marcello (No. 3), Duke Johann Ernst of\r\n      Weimar (Nos. 11, 16, and perhaps 13).\r\n\r\n  539 The Toccata is by Henry Purcell. See Grove, vol. iii. p. 857.\r\n\r\n  540 The volume also contains a Variant of the first Organ Concerto (B.G.\r\n      XXXVIII.).\r\n\r\n  541 The Concerto is an arrangement of one by Antonio Vivaldi for four\r\n      Violins, the original of which (in B minor) is given in the Appendix\r\n      to the volume.\r\n\r\n  542 Omitting the vocal numbers, movements printed elsewhere, and the\r\n      “Menuet fait par Mons. Böhm,” Peters’ Bk. 1959 contains the\r\n      remaining twenty numbers of the Notebook. They are indicated in the\r\n      above index by a P in a bracket.\r\n\r\n  543 A separate Preface to the reprinted Suites is by Ernst Naumann. It\r\n      is dated 1895.\r\n\r\n  544 Perhaps an arrangement of an orchestral piece. See Schweitzer, i.\r\n      342 n.\r\n\r\n  545 The Appendix to the volume contains addenda to the Violin Concerto\r\n      in A minor (see B.G. XXL. (1)) and Cantata 188 (see B.G. XXXVII.).\r\n      Also the Zurich and London texts of the “Welltempered Clavier” (B.G.\r\n      XIV.), with critical notes.\r\n\r\n  546 The Preface is dated 1899. The volume was issued in 1900.\r\n\r\n  547 The original words are “Die Schätzbarkeit der weiten Erden.”\r\n\r\n  548 The title-page is dated 1913 and the Preface “Im Advent auf 1914.”\r\n\r\n  549 The Aria is no. 20 of A. M. Bach’s “Notenbuch” for 1725. See E.G.\r\n      XLII. (2) no. 20.\r\n\r\n  550 This publication, announced for 1916, appears under a different\r\n      title as the third issue for 1917.
