Render _sens_\r\nby _genius_ and _malice_ by _diplomacy_ and the words are not far\r\nwrong. Yet in spite of the failure to obtain either a kingly or an\r\nimperial crown, the story of those same unaccomplished enterprises\r\ncontains the germs of much that has happened later in the borderlands\r\nof France and Germany where the projected \"middle kingdom\" might have\r\nbeen erected. A sketch of the duke's character with its traits of\r\nambition and shortcomings may therefore be placed, not unfitly, among\r\nthe pen portraits of individuals who have attempted to change the map\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nThe materials for an exhaustive study of the times, and of the\r\nparticipants in the scenes thereof, are almost overwhelming\r\nin quantity. Into this narrative, I have woven the words of\r\ncontemporaries when these related what they saw and thought, or at\r\nleast what they said they saw or thought, about events passing within\r\ntheir sight or their ken. The veracity attained is only that of a\r\nmosaic of bits, each with its morsel of truth. And the rim in which\r\nthese bits are set is too slender to contain all the illumination\r\nnecessary. The narrative is, of necessity, partial and fragmentary,\r\nfor a complete story would require a series of biographies presented\r\nin parallel columns. My own preliminary chapter to this book--a\r\nmere explanation of the presence of the dukes of Burgundy in the\r\nNetherlands--grew into an account of a sovereign whom they deposed and\r\nwas published under the title of _A Mediæval Princess._\r\n\r\nJohn Foster Kirk gave 1713 pages to his record of Charles the Bold,\r\nDuke of Burgundy. Forty years have elapsed since that publication\r\nappeared and a mass of interesting material pertinent to the subject\r\nhas been given out to the public, while separate phases of it have\r\nbeen minutely discussed by competent critics, so that at every point\r\nthere is new temptation for the biographer to expand the theme where\r\nthe scope of his work demands brevity.\r\n\r\nIn using the later fruit of historical investigation, it is delightful\r\nfor an American to find that scholars of all nations do justice to\r\nMr. Kirk's accuracy and industry even when they may differ from his\r\nconclusions. It has been my privilege to be permitted free access to\r\nthis scholar's collection of books, and I would here express my deep\r\ngratitude to the Kirk family for their generosity and courtesy towards\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary reading at Brussels and Paris and in England,\r\nthe work for this volume has been completed in America, where the\r\nopportunity of securing the latest results of research and criticism\r\nis constantly increasing, although these results are still lodged\r\nunder many roofs. I have had many reasons to thank the librarians of\r\nNew York, Boston, and Washington, and also those of Harvard, Columbia,\r\nand Cornell universities for courtesies and for serviceable aid; and\r\njust as many reasons to regret the meagreness of what can be put\r\nbetween two covers as the gleanings from so rich a harvest.\r\n\r\nOne word further in explanation of the use of _Bold_. The adjective\r\nhas been retained simply because it has been so long identified with\r\nCharles in English usage. I should have preferred the word _Rash_ as\r\na better equivalent for the contemporary term, applied to the duke in\r\nhis lifetime,--_le téméraire_.\r\n\r\nR.P.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., 1908.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n*  *  *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nCHILDHOOD\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nYOUTH\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE FEAST OF THE PHEASANT\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nBURGUNDY AND FRANCE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE COUNT AND THE DAUPHIN\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE WAR OF PUBLIC WEAL\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nLIEGE AND ITS FATE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE NEW DUKE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE UNJOYOUS ENTRY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nTHE DUKE'S MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nTHE MEETING AT PERONNE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nAN EASY VICTORY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nA NEW ACQUISITION\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nENGLISH AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nNEGOTIATIONS AND TREACHERY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nGUELDERS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nTHE MEETING AT TRÈVES\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nCOLOGNE, LORRAINE, AND ALSACE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nTHE FIRST REVERSES\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nTHE CAMPAIGNS OF 1475 AND 1476\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nTHE BATTLE OF NANCY\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n*  *  *\r\n\r\nCHARLES THE BOLD, DUKE OF BURGUNDY          _Frontispiece_\r\nFrom MS. statute book of the Order of the Golden\r\nFleece at Vienna.

The mere\r\npresence of the sovereign in the capital of his duchy was in itself\r\na gala event from its rarity. Various cities of the dominions\r\nagglomerated under his sway claimed his attentions successively. His\r\nresidence was now here and now there, without long tarrying anywhere.\r\nHis coming was usually very welcome. In times of peaceful submission\r\nto his behest, the city of his sojourn reaped many advantages besides\r\nthe amusement of seeing her streets alive beyond their wont. In the\r\noutlay for the necessities and the luxuries of the peripatetic ducal\r\ncourt, the expenditures were lavish, and in the temporary commercial\r\nactivity enjoyed by the merchants, the fact that the burghers' own\r\ncontributions to this luxury were heavy, passed into temporary\r\noblivion.[1]\r\n\r\nThis autumn visit of Philip the Good to Dijon was more significant\r\nthan usual. It had lasted several weeks, and among its notable\r\noccasions was an assembly of the Knights of the Golden Fleece for the\r\nthird anniversary of their Order. On this November 30th, Burgundy was\r\nto witness for the first time the pompous ceremonials inaugurated at\r\nBruges in January, 1430. Three years had sufficed to render the new\r\ninstitution almost as well known as its senior English rival, the\r\nOrder of the Garter, which it was destined to outshine for a brief\r\nperiod at least. Its foundation had formed part of the elaborate\r\nfestivities accompanying the celebration of the marriage of Philip,\r\nDuke of Burgundy, to Isabella of Portugal. As a signal honour to his\r\nbride, Philip published his intention of creating a new order of\r\nknighthood which would evince \"his great and perfect love for the\r\nnoble state of chivalry.\"\r\n\r\nRumour, indeed, told various tales about the duke's real motives. It\r\nwas whispered that a certain lady of Bruges, whom he had distinguished\r\nby his attentions, was ridiculed for her red hair by a few merry\r\ncourtiers, whereupon Philip declared that her tresses should be\r\nimmortally honoured in the golden emblem of a new society.[2] But that\r\nmay be set down as gossip. Philip's own assertion, when he instituted\r\nthe Order of the Golden Fleece, was that he intended to create a\r\nbulwark\r\n\r\n    \"for the reverence of God and the sustenance of our Christian\r\n    faith, and to honour and enhance the noble order of chivalry, and\r\n    also for three reasons hereafter declared; first, to honour the\r\n    ancient knights ...; second, to the end that these present.... may\r\n    exercise the deeds of chivalry and constantly improve; third, that\r\n    all gentlemen marking the honour paid to the knights will exert\r\n    themselves to attain the dignity.\" [2]\r\n\r\nThe special homage to the new duchess was expressed in the device\r\n\r\n  _Aultre n'aray\r\n   Dame Isabeau tant que vivray[4]_\r\n\r\nThis pledge of absolute fidelity to Dame Isabella was, indeed, utterly\r\ndisregarded by the bridegroom, but in outward and formal honour to her\r\nhe never failed.\r\n\r\nThe new institution was, from the beginning, pre-eminently significant\r\nof the duke's magnificent state existence, wherein his Portuguese\r\nconsort proved herself an efficient and able helpmeet. Again and again\r\nduring a period of thirty years, rich in diplomatic parleying, did\r\nIsabella act as confidential ambassador for her husband, and many were\r\nthe negotiations conducted by her to his satisfaction.[5]\r\n\r\nBut it must be noted that whatever lay at the exact root of Philip's\r\nmotives when he conceived the plan of his Order, the actual result of\r\nhis foundation was not affected. He failed, indeed, to bring back into\r\nthe world the ancient system of knighthood in its ideal purity and\r\nstrength. Rather did he make a notable contribution to its decadence\r\nand speed its parting. What was brought into existence was a house\r\nof peers for the head of the Burgundian family, a body of faithful\r\nsatellites who did not hamper their chief overmuch with the criticism\r\npermitted by the rules of their society, while their own glory added\r\nshining rays to the brilliant centre of the Burgundian court.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five, inclusive of the duke, was the original number appointed\r\nto form the chosen circle of knights. This was speedily increased to\r\nthirty-one, and a duty to be performed in the session of 1433, was\r\nthe election of new members to fill vacancies and to round out the\r\nallotted tale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP THE GOOD AS FOUNDER OF THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN\r\nFLEECE]\r\n\r\nIn their manner of accomplishing the appointed task, the new\r\nchevaliers had, from the outset, evinced a readiness to cast their\r\nvotes to the satisfaction of their chief, even if his pleasure\r\ndirectly conflicted with the regulations they had sworn to obey. No\r\ncandidate was to be eligible whose birth was not legitimate,[6] a\r\nregulation quite ignored when the duke proposed the names of his sons\r\nCornelius and Anthony. For his obedient knights did not refuse to open\r\ntheir ranks to these great bastards of Burgundy, who carried a bar\r\nsinister proudly on their escutcheon. So, too, others of Philip's many\r\nillegitimate descendants were not rejected when their father proposed\r\ntheir names.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was plainly stipulated that the new member should have\r\nproven himself a knight of renown. Yet, in this session of 1433, one\r\nof the candidates proposed for election, though nominally a knight,\r\nhad assuredly had no time to show his mettle. The dignity was his only\r\nbecause his spurs had been thrown right royally into his cradle before\r\nhis tiny hands had sufficient baby strength to grasp a rattle, and\r\nbefore he was even old enough to use the pleasant gold to cut his\r\nteeth upon.[7]\r\n\r\nAmong the eight elected at Dijon in 1433, was Charles of Burgundy,\r\nCount of Charolais, son of the sovereign duke, born at Dijon on the\r\nprevious St. Martin's Eve, November 10th.[8]\r\n\r\n    \"The new chevaliers, with the exception of the Count of\r\n    Virnenbourg who was absent, took the accustomed oath at the hands\r\n    of the sovereign in a room of his palace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo runs the record. Jean le Févre, Seigneur de St. Remy, present on\r\nthe occasion in his capacity of king-at-arms of the Order, is a trifle\r\nmore communicative.[9] According to him, all the gentlemen were very\r\njoyous at their election as they received their collars and made their\r\nvows as stated. He excepted no member in the phrase about the joy\r\ndisplayed, though, as a matter of inference, the pleasure experienced\r\nby the Count of Charolais may be reckoned as somewhat problematical.\r\n\r\nThe heir of Burgundy had attained the ripe age of just twenty days\r\nwhen thus officially listed among the chevaliers present at the\r\nfestival. Born on November 10th of this same year, 1433,[10] he had\r\nbeen knighted on the very day of his baptism, when Charles, Count of\r\nNevers, and the Seigneur of Croy were his sponsors. The former gave\r\nhis name to the infant while the latter's name was destined to be\r\nidentified with many unpleasant incidents in the career of the future\r\nman. This brief span of life is sufficient reason for the further item\r\nin the archives of the Golden Fleece:\r\n\r\n    \"As to the Count of Charolais, he was carried into the same room.\r\n    There the sovereign, his father, and the duchess, his mother, took\r\n    the oath on his behalf. Afterwards the duke put the collars upon\r\n    all.\" [11]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus was emphasised at birth the parental conviction that Charles of\r\nBurgundy was of different metal than the rest of the world. The great\r\nduke of the Occident made a distinct epoch in the history of chivalry\r\nwhen he conferred its dignities upon a speechless, unconscious infant.\r\nThe theory that knighthood was a personal acquisition had been\r\nmaintained up to this period, the Children of France[12] alone being\r\nexcepted from the rule, though in his _Lay de Vaillance_ Eustache\r\nDeschamps complains that the degree of knighthood is actually\r\nconferred on those who are only ten or twelve years old, and who do\r\nnot know what to do with the honour.[13] That plaint was written not\r\nlater than the first years of the fifteenth century, and the poet's\r\nprediction that ruin of the institution was imminent when affected by\r\nsuch disorders seemed justified if, in 1433, even the years of the\r\neligible age had shrunk to days. Philip himself had not received the\r\naccolade until he was twenty-five.\r\n\r\nHow his predecessor in Holland, Count William VI., had acquitted\r\nhimself valiantly the moment that he was dubbed knight is told by\r\nFroissart, and the tales of other accolades of the period are too well\r\nknown to need reference.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the baby cavalier was nourished by his own mother.\r\nHaving lost her first two infants, Isabella was solicitous for the\r\nwelfare of this third child, who also proved her last. He was,\r\nmoreover, Philip's sole legal heir, as Michelle of France and Bonne of\r\nArtois, his first wives, had left no offspring. The care and devotion\r\nexpended on the boy were repaid. Charles became a sturdy child who\r\ndeveloped into youthful vigour. In person, he strangely resembled\r\nhis mother and her Portuguese ancestors, rather than the English\r\nLancastrians, from whom she was equally descended.\r\n\r\nHis dark hair and his features were very different from the fair type\r\nof his paternal ancestors, the vigorous branch of the Valois family.\r\nPossibly other characteristics suggesting his Portuguese origin were\r\nintensified by close association with his mother, who supervised the\r\neducation directed by the Seigneur d' Auxy. They often lived at The\r\nHague, where Isabella acted as chief and official adviser to the\r\nduke's stadtholder in the administration. [14]\r\n\r\nCharles was a diligent pupil, if we may believe his contemporaries,\r\nsurprisingly so, considering his early taste for all martial pursuits\r\nand his intense interest in military operations.\r\n\r\nAt two years of age he received his first lesson in horsemanship, on\r\na wooden steed constructed for his especial use by Jean Rampart, a\r\nsaddler of Brussels.\r\n\r\nHis biographers repeat from each other statements of his proficiency\r\nin Latin. This must be balanced by noting that the only texts which\r\nhe could have read were probably not classic. In the inventory of the\r\nvarious Burgundian libraries of the period, there are not six Greek\r\nand Latin classical texts all told, and excepting Sallust, not a\r\nsingle Roman historian in the original.[15] There was a translation\r\nof Livy by the Prior of St. Eloi and late abridgments of Sallust,\r\nSuetonius, Lucan, and Cæsar,[16] with a French version of Valerius\r\nMaximus, but nothing of Tacitus. Doubtless these versions and a volume\r\ncalled _Les faits des Romains_ were used as text-books to teach the\r\nyoung count about the world's conquerors. The last mentioned book\r\nshows what travesties of Roman history were gravely read in the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere are stories[17] that the bit of history most enjoyed by the\r\npupil was the narrative of Alexander. Books about that hero were easy\r\nto come by long before the invention of printing, though Alexander\r\nwould have had difficulty in recognising his identity under the\r\nstrange mediæval motley in which his namesake wandered over the land.\r\nNo single man, with the possible exception of Charlemagne, was so\r\nmuch written about or played so brilliantly the part of a hero to\r\nthe Middle Ages and after.[18] The simplicity and universality of his\r\nsuccess were of a type to appeal to the boy Charles, himself built on\r\nsimple lines. The fact, too, that Alexander was the son of a Philip\r\nstimulated his imagination and instilled in his breast hopes of\r\nconquering, not the whole world perhaps, but a good slice of territory\r\nwhich should enable him to hold his own between the emperor and the\r\nFrench king. Tales of definite schemes of early ambition are often\r\nfabricated in the later life of a conqueror, but in this case they may\r\nbe believed, as all threads of testimony lead to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe air breathed by the boy when he first became conscious of his\r\nown individuality was certainly heavy with the aroma of satisfied\r\nambition. The period of his childhood was a time when his father stood\r\nat the very zenith of his power. In 1435, was signed the Treaty of\r\nArras, the death-blow to the long coalition existing between Burgundy\r\nand England to the continual detriment of France. Philip was\r\nreconciled with great solemnity to the king, responsible in his\r\ndauphin days for the murder of the late Duke of Burgundy. After\r\nostentatiously parading his filial resentment sixteen long years,\r\nPhilip forgave Charles VII. his share in the death of John the\r\nFearless, on the bridge at Montereau, and swore to lend his support to\r\nkeep the French monarch on the throne whither the efforts of Joan of\r\nArc had carried him from Bourges, the forlorn court of his exile.\r\n\r\nEngland's pretensions were repudiated. To be sure, the recent\r\ncoronation of Henry VI. at Paris was not immediately forgotten, but\r\nwhile the Duke of Bedford had actually administered the government as\r\nregent, in behalf of his infant nephew, it was a mere shadow of his\r\noffice that passed to his successor. Bedford's death, in 1435, was\r\nalmost coincident with the compact at Arras when the English Henry's\r\nrealms across the Channel shrank to Normandy and the outlying\r\nfortresses of Picardy and Maine. Later events on English soil were to\r\nprove how little fitted was the son of Henry V. for sovereignty of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nOut of the negotiations at Arras, Philip of Burgundy rose triumphant\r\nwith a seal set upon his personal importance.[19] His recognition of\r\nCharles VII. as lawful sovereign of France, and his reconciliation did\r\nnot pass without signal gain to himself.\r\n\r\nThe king declared his own hands unstained by the blood of John of\r\nBurgundy, agreed to punish all those designated by Philip as actually\r\nresponsible for that treacherous murder, and pledged himself to erect\r\na cross on the bridge at Montereau, the scene of the crime. Further,\r\nhe relinquished various revenues in Burgundy, hitherto retained by the\r\ncrown from the moment when the junior branch of the Valois had been\r\ninvested with the duchy (1364); and he ceded the counties of Boulogne,\r\nArtois, and all the seigniories belonging to the French sovereign on\r\nboth banks of the Somme. To this last cession, however, was appended\r\nthe condition that the towns included in this clause could be redeemed\r\nat the king's pleasure, for the sum of four hundred thousand gold\r\ncrowns. Further, Charles exempted Philip from acts of homage to\r\nhimself, promised to demand no _aides_ from the duke's subjects\r\nin case of war, and to assist his cousin if he were attacked from\r\nEngland. Lastly, he renounced an alliance lately contracted with the\r\nemperor to Philip's disadvantage.[20]\r\n\r\nOne clause in the treaty crowned the royal submissiveness towards the\r\npowerful vassal. It provided that in case of Charles's failure to\r\nobserve all the stipulated conditions, his own subjects would be\r\njustified in taking arms against him at the duke's orders. A similar\r\nclause occurs in certain treaties between an earlier French king and\r\nhis Flemish vassals, but always to the advantage of the suzerain, not\r\nto that of the lesser lords.\r\n\r\nThe duke was left in a position infinitely superior to that of the\r\nking, whose realm was terribly exhausted by the long contest with\r\nEngland, a contest wherein one nation alone had felt the invader's\r\nfoot. French prosperity had been nibbled off like green foliage before\r\na swarm of locusts, and the whole north-eastern portion of France\r\nwas in a sorry state of desolation by 1435. On the other hand, the\r\nterritories covered by Burgundy as an overlord had greatly increased\r\nduring the sixteen years that Philip had worn the title. An\r\naggregation of duchies, counties, and lordships formed his domain,\r\nloosely hung together by reason of their several titles being vested\r\nin one person--titles which the bearer had inherited or assumed under\r\nvarious pretexts.\r\n\r\nFlanders and Artois, together with the duchy and county of Burgundy,\r\ncame to him from his father, John the Fearless, in 1419. In 1421, he\r\nbought Namur. In 1430, he declared himself heir to his cousins in\r\nBrabant and Limbourg when Duke Anthony's second son followed his\r\nequally childless brother into a premature grave, and the claims were\r\nmade good in spite of all opposition. Holland, Zealand, and Hainaut\r\nbecame his through the unwilling abdication of his other cousin,\r\nJacqueline, in 1433. To save the life of her husband, Frank van\r\nBorselen, the last representative of the Bavarian House then\r\nformally resigned her titles, which she had already divested of all\r\nsignificance five years previously, when Philip of Burgundy had become\r\nher _ruward_, to relieve a \"poor feminine person\" of a weight of\r\nresponsibility too heavy for her shoulders.[21]\r\n\r\nDivers items in the accounts show what Philip expended in having\r\nthe titles of Holland, Zealand, and Hainaut added to his other\r\ndesignations. Also there were various places where his predecessor's\r\nname had to be effaced to make room for his. (Laborde, i., 345).]\r\n\r\nAntwerp and Mechlin were included in Brabant. Luxemburg was a later\r\nacquisition obtained through Elizabeth of Görlitz.\r\n\r\nThere were very shady bits in the chapters about Philip's entry into\r\nmany of his possessions, but it is interesting to note how cleverly\r\nthe best colour is given to his actions by Olivier de la Marche and\r\nother writers who enjoyed Burgundian patronage. Very gentle are the\r\nadjectives employed, and a nice cloak of legality is thrown over the\r\nnaked facts as they are ushered into history. Contemporary criticism\r\ndid occasionally make itself heard, especially from the emperor, who\r\ndeclared that the Netherland provinces must come to him as a lapsed\r\nimperial fief. For a time Philip denied that any links existed between\r\nhis domain and the empire, but in 1449 he finally found it convenient\r\nto discuss the question with Frederic III. at Besançon; still he never\r\ncame to the point of paying homage.\r\n\r\nAll these territories made a goodly realm for a mere duke. But\r\nthey were individual entities centred around one head with little\r\ninterconnection.\r\n\r\nPhilip thought that the one thing needed to bring his possessions into\r\na national life, as coherent as that of France, was a unity of legal\r\nexistence among the dissimilar parts, and the effort to attain this\r\nunity was the one thought dominating the career of his successor,\r\nwhose pompous introduction to life naturally inspired him with a high\r\nidea of his own rank, and led him to dream of greater dignities for\r\nhimself and his successor than a bundle of titles,--a splendid, vain,\r\nfatal dream as it proved.\r\n\r\nAs a final cement to the new friendship between Burgundy and France,\r\nit was also agreed at Arras that the heir of the former should wed a\r\ndaughter of Charles VII. When the Count of Charolais was five years\r\nold, the Seigneur of Crèvecoeur,[22] \"a wise and prudent gentleman\"\r\nwas despatched to the French court on divers missions, among which\r\nwas the business of negotiating the projected alliance. A very joyous\r\nreception was accorded the envoy by the king and the queen, and his\r\nproposal was accepted in behalf of the second daughter, Catherine,\r\neasily substituted for an older sister, deceased between the first and\r\nsecond stages of negotiation.\r\n\r\nA year later, a formal betrothal took place at St Omer, whither\r\nthe young bride was conducted, most honourably accompanied by the\r\narchbishops of Rheims and of Narbonne, by the counts of Vendôme,\r\nTonnerre, and Dunois, the young son of the Duke of Bourbon, named the\r\nLord of Beaujeu, and various other distinguished nobles, besides a\r\ntrain of noble dames and demoiselles in special attendance on the\r\nprincess, and an escort of three hundred horse.\r\n\r\nAt the various cities where the party made halt they were graciously\r\nreceived, and all honour was paid to the ten-year-old Daughter of\r\nFrance. At Cambray, she was met by the duke's envoys and as she\r\ntravelled on towards her destination, all the towns of Philip's\r\nobedience contributed their quota of welcome.\r\n\r\nAt St. Omer, the duke was awaiting her coming. When her approach was\r\nannounced he rode out in person to greet her, attended by a brilliant\r\nescort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DUKE OF BURGUNDY AND THE POPE AT AVIGNON]\r\n\r\nWithin the city, \"melodious festivals\" were ready to burst into tune;\r\nthe betrothal was confirmed amid joyousness and the ceremony was\r\nfollowed by tourneys and jousts, all at the expense of the duke.\r\n\r\nWhat a series of pompous betrothals between infant parties the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries can show! Poor little puppets, in\r\nwhose persons national interests were supposed to be centred, were\r\nmade to lisp out their roles in international dramas whose final acts\r\nrarely were consistent with the promise of the prologue.\r\n\r\nCatherine did not live to become Duchess of Burgundy nor to temper the\r\nduel between her husband and her brother Louis. The remainder of\r\nher short existence was passed under the care of Duchess Isabella,\r\nsometimes in one city of the Netherlands, sometimes in another.\r\n\r\nLa Marche[23] records one return of Philip to Brussels when his\r\narrival was greeted by Charles of Burgundy, honourably accompanied\r\nby children of high birth about his age or less, some only eleven or\r\ntwelve years old. There were with him Jehan de la Trémoille, Philip\r\nde Croy, Philip de Crèvecoeur, Philip de Wavrin, and many others. All\r\nwere mounted on little horses harnessed like that of their governor, a\r\nvery honest and wise gentleman, named Messire Jehan, Seigneur et Ber\r\nd'Auxy. This gentleman was a fine man, well known, of good lineage,\r\nready of speech and able to discuss matters of honour and of state.\r\n\r\nHe was both hunter and falconer, skilled in all exercise and sport.\r\n\r\n    \"Never [asserts La Marche] have I met a gentleman better adapted\r\n    to supervise the education of a young prince than he.... Among his\r\n    pupils were also Anthony, Bastard of Burgundy,[24] son of Philip,\r\n    and the Marquis Hugues de Rottelin. These lads were older than the\r\n    first mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nLa Marche dilates on the pleasure the duke felt in this youthful band\r\nof horse, and then tells how, within Brussels,\r\n\r\n    \"he was received by the magistrates and conducted to his palace,\r\n    where the Duchess of Burgundy awaited him holding by the hand\r\n    Madame Catherine of France, Countess of Charolais. She was about\r\n    twelve and seemed a lady grown, for she was good and wise, and\r\n    well conditioned for her age.\"\r\n\r\nAt various state functions the Count and Countess of Charolais\r\nappeared together in public, and witnessed certain of the gorgeous\r\nand costly entertainments which were almost the daily food of the gay\r\nBurgundian court. One of these occasions was calculated to make a deep\r\nimpression on the boy and to arouse his pride at the spectacle of a\r\nproud city wooing his father's favour, in deep humiliation.\r\n\r\nIn 1436, an insurrection had occurred in Bruges, when the animosity of\r\nthe burghers had caused the duchess to flee from their midst, holding\r\nher little son in her arms, alarmed for his personal safety. Philip\r\nsuppressed the revolt, but, in his anger at its insolence, declared\r\nthat never again would he set foot within the gates unless in company\r\nwith his superior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP THE GOOD AS PATRON OF LETTERS\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG COUNT OF CHAROLAIS IS IN THE BACKGROUND WITH ONE OF PHILIP'S\r\nSONS FROM MINIATURE REPRODUCED IN BARANTE, \"HIST. DES DUCS DE\r\nBOURGOGNE\"]\r\n\r\nAmong the many negotiations wherein Isabella played a prominent part\r\nas her husband's representative, were those concerning the liberation\r\nof the Duke of Orleans, who had remained in England, a prisoner, after\r\nthe battle of Agincourt in 1415. The last advice given by Henry V.\r\nto his brothers was that they should make this captivity perpetual.\r\nTherefore, whenever overtures were made for his redemption, a strong\r\nparty, headed by Humphrey of Gloucester, rejected them vehemently.\r\n\r\nIn 1440, however, there was a turn in the tide of sentiment. Possibly\r\nthe low state of the English exchequer made the duke's ransom more\r\nattractive than his person. At any rate, 120,000 golden crowns were\r\naccepted as his equivalent, and the exile of twenty-five years\r\nreturned to France, having pledged himself never to bear arms against\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIsabella of Burgundy was at Calais to welcome him, and to escort him\r\nto St. Omer, where high revels were held in his honour and in that of\r\nhis alliance with Marie of Cleves, Philip's niece.\r\n\r\nThe week intervening between the betrothal and the nuptials was\r\npassed in a succession of banquets and tourneys, gorgeous in their\r\nelaboration. Moreover, St. Andrew's Day chancing to fall just then,\r\nthe new Burgundian Order was convened and the Duke of Orleans was\r\nelected a Knight of the Golden Fleece, while in his turn he presented\r\nhis cousin with the collar of his own Order of the Porcupine. Lord\r\nCornwallis and other English gentlemen who had accompanied Orleans\r\nacross the Channel participated in these gaieties, nor were they among\r\nthe least favoured guests, adds Barante.\r\n\r\nAmity was triumphant, and there was a general feeling abroad that the\r\nreturned exile was henceforth to be the ruling power in France. People\r\nbegan to look to him to act as the go-between in their behalf, to be\r\ntheir mediator with Charles VII., still little known at his best. Many\r\ntowns turned towards him in hopes of finding a friend, and among them\r\nwas Bruges. But it was not royal favours that Bruges sought. Her\r\nburghers felt great inconvenience from the breach with their sovereign\r\nduke. Anxious to be reinstated in his grace, they seized the\r\nopportunity of reminding Philip of his assertion, and they besought\r\nhim to enter their gates in company with the Duke of Orleans, a\r\nprince of the blood, closer to the French sovereign than the Duke of\r\nBurgundy.\r\n\r\nAfter some demur, Philip consented to grant their petition. Possibly\r\nhe was not loth to be persuaded. The deputies hastened back to Bruges\r\nto rejoice their fellow-citizens with the news, and to prepare a\r\nreception for their appeased sovereign, calculated to make him content\r\nwith the late rebels.\r\n\r\nBefore the grand cortège, composed of the two dukes, their consorts,\r\nand the dignitaries who had assisted in the feasts of marriage and of\r\nchivalry, reached the gates of Bruges, the citizens were ready with a\r\ntouching spectacle of humility and repentance.[25]\r\n\r\nA league from the gates, the magistrates and burghers stood in the\r\nroad awaiting the travellers from St. Omer. All were barefooted and\r\nbareheaded. Under the December sky they waited the approach of the\r\nstately procession. When the duke arrived, they all fell upon their\r\nknees and implored him to forgive the late troubles and to reinstate\r\ntheir city in his favour. Philip did not answer immediately--delay was\r\nalways a feature of these episodes. Thereupon, the Duke of Orleans,\r\nboth duchesses, and all the gentlemen joined their entreaties to the\r\ncitizens' prayers. Again a pause, and then, as if generously yielding\r\nto pressure, Philip bade the burghers put on their shoes and their\r\nhats while he accepted at their hands the keys of all the gates. Then\r\nthe long procession moved on towards Bruges. At the gate were the\r\nclergy, followed by the monks, nuns, and beguins of the various\r\nconvents and foundations, bearing crosses, banners, reliquaries, and\r\nmany precious ecclesiastical treasures. There, too, were the gilds\r\nand merchants, on horseback, with magnificent accoutrements freshly\r\nburnished to do honour to the welcome they offered their forgiving\r\noverlord.\r\n\r\nThroughout Bruges, at convenient places, platforms and stages\r\nwere erected, whereon were enacted dramatic performances, given\r\ncontinuously, to provide amusement for the collected crowds. Sometimes\r\nthe presentation carried significance beyond mere entertainment. Here\r\na maid, garbed as a wood nymph, appeared leading a swan which wore the\r\ncollar of the Golden Fleece and a porcupine. This last beast was to\r\nsymbolise the Orleans device, _Near and Far_, as the creature was\r\nsupposed to project his spines to a distance.\r\n\r\nOne enthusiastic citizen covered his whole house with gold and the\r\nroof with silver leaves to betoken his satisfaction. Indeed, if we\r\nmay believe the chroniclers, never in the memory of man had any city\r\nincurred so much expense to honour its lord. The duke permitted his\r\nheart to be touched by these proofs of devotion, and on the very\r\nevening of his arrival he evinced that his confidence was restored by\r\nsending the civic keys and a gracious message to the magistrates. At\r\nthe news of this condescension the cries of \"_Noël_\" re-echoed afresh\r\nthrough the illuminated streets.\r\n\r\nCharles was not present at this entry, which took place on Saturday,\r\nDecember 11th, but Philip was so much entertained with the performance\r\nthat he sent for his son, and on the following Saturday he and the\r\nCountess of Charolais came from Ghent to join the party. The Duke of\r\nOrleans and many nobles rode out of the city to meet the young couple,\r\nwho were formally escorted to the palace by magistrates and citizens\r\nin a body. On the Sunday there were repetitions of some of the plays\r\nand every attention was offered by the Bruges burghers to their young\r\nguests. When Orleans departed with his bride on Tuesday, December\r\n14th, what wonder that the lady wept in sorrow at leaving these gay\r\nBurgundian doings!\r\n\r\nWhile Charles did not actually witness the humiliation of the\r\ncitizens, the seven-year-old boy would, undoubtedly, have heard and\r\nknown sufficient of the cause of the festivals to be fully aware that\r\nthe citizens who had dared defy his father were glad to buy back his\r\nsmiles at any cost to their pride and purse. He would have known, too,\r\nthat merchants from Venice, Genoa, Florence, and elsewhere joined the\r\nBruges burghers in the welcome to the mollified overlord. It was a\r\nspectacle of the relations between a city and the ducal father not to\r\nbe easily forgotten by the son.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The indefatigable Gachard has published an itinerary of\r\nPhilip the Good, so far as he could make it. _(Collection des voyages\r\ndes souverains des Pays Bas_, i., 71.) Unfortunately, owing to\r\nthe destruction of papers, only a few years are complete. Between\r\n1428-1441, there is nothing. But the itinerary for 1441 and for other\r\nyears shows how often the duke changed his residences.

With his own manifold interests, it\r\nwas impossible for him to be present in his various capitals as often\r\nas was demanded by the usage of the diverse individual seigniories. It\r\nwas politic, therefore, to magnify the representative capacity of his\r\nson and of his consort in order to obtain the grants and _aides_ which\r\ncertain of his subjects declared could be given only when requested\r\norally by their sovereign lord. Thus, in 1444, it was Count Charles\r\nand the duchess who appeared in Holland to ask an _aide_.[1] In the\r\nfollowing year, Charles accompanied his father when Philip made one\r\nof his rare visits--there were only three between 1428 and 1466--to\r\nHolland and Zealand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CASTLE IN BURGUNDY]\r\n\r\nOlivier de la Marche was among the attendants on this occasion, and he\r\ndescribes with great detail how rejoiced were the inhabitants to have\r\ntheir absentee count in their land.[2] Many matters could only be\r\nset aright by his authority. Among the complaints brought to him at\r\nMiddelburg were accusations against a certain knight of high birth,\r\nJehan de Dombourc. Philip ordered that the man be arrested at once and\r\nbrought before him for trial. This was easier said than done. Warned\r\nof his danger, Dombourc, with four or five comrades, took refuge in\r\nthe clock tower of the church of the Cordeliers, a sanctuary that\r\ncould not be taken by storm.[2] He was provided with a good store of\r\nfood, this audacious criminal, and prepared to stand a siege. There he\r\nremained three days, because, for the honour of the Church, they could\r\nnot fire upon him.\r\n\r\n\"And I remember [adds La Marche] seeing a nun come out and call to\r\nJehan Dombourc, her brother, advising him to perish defending himself\r\nrather than to dishonour their lineage by falling into the hands of\r\nthe executioner. Nevertheless, finally he was forced to surrender to\r\nhis prince, and he was beheaded in the market-place at Middelburg,\r\nbut, at the plea of his sister, the said nun, his body was delivered\r\nto her to be buried in consecrated ground.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same visit Philip presided over the Zealand estates and the\r\nyoung count sat by his side, not as an idle spectator, but because\r\nusage required the presence of the heir as well as that of the Count\r\nof Zealand.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles was twelve he was present at an assembly of the Order of\r\nthe Golden Fleece held in Ghent. It was the first occasion of the kind\r\nwitnessed by La Marche, and very minute is his description of the\r\nlavish magnificence of the affair, undoubtedly intended to awe the\r\ncitizens into complying with the requests of their Count of Flanders.\r\n\r\nCharles played a prominent part in all the functions, and assisted in\r\nthe election of his tutor, Seigneur et Ber d'Auxy. Another candidate\r\nof that year was Frank van Borselen, Count of Ostrevant, widower of\r\nJacqueline, late Countess of Holland.\r\n\r\nIn 1446, the little Countess of Charolais died at Brussels.\r\n\"Honourably as befitted a king's daughter\" was she buried at Ste.\r\nGudule.[4]\r\n\r\n    \"Tireless in their devotion were the duke and duchess in her last\r\n    illness, and Charles VII. despatched two skilled doctors to her\r\n    aid but all efforts were vain.\r\n\r\n    \"Much bemourned was the princess for she was virtuous. God have\r\n    pity on her soul\"\r\n\r\npiously ejaculates La Marche.\r\n\r\nA little item[5] in the accounts suggests that a pleasant friendship\r\nhad existed between the two young people:\r\n\r\n    \"To Jehan de la Court, harper of Mme. the Countess of Charolais,\r\n    for a harp which she had bought from him and given to Ms. the\r\n    Count of Charolais for him to play and take his amusement, xii\r\n    francs.\"[6]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to surmise that music was not, however, the young count's\r\nfavourite amusement. In Philip's court, tournaments were still held\r\nand afforded a fascinating entertainment for a lad whose bent was\r\nundoubtedly towards a military career.\r\n\r\nOne valiant actor in these tourneys where were revived the ancient\r\ntraditions of knighthood, was Jacques de Lalaing, a chevalier with all\r\nthe characteristics of times past, fighting for fame in the present.\r\nIn his youth, this aspirant for reputation swore a vow to meet thirty\r\nknights in combat before he attained his thirtieth year. Dominated by\r\na desire to fulfil his vow, Lalaing haunted the court of Burgundy,\r\nbecause the Netherlands were on the highroad between England and many\r\npoints in Germany, Italy, and the East, and there he had the best\r\nchance of falling in with all the prowess that might be abroad. For\r\nstay-at-home prowess he cared naught. A delightful personage is\r\nMessire Jacques and a brave rôle does he play in the series of jousts,\r\nsporting gaily on the pages of the various Burgundian chroniclers,\r\nwho recorded in their old age what they had seen in their youth. One\r\ndescription, however, of these encounters reads much like another and\r\nthey need not be repeated.\r\n\r\nDuring his childhood Charles was a spectator only on the days of mimic\r\nbattle. In his seventeenth year he was permitted to enter the lists\r\nas a regular combatant, a permission shared by his fellow pupils all\r\neager to flesh their maiden spears. The duke arranged that his son\r\nshould have a preliminary tilt a few days before the public affair in\r\norder to test his ability. All the courtiers--and apparently ladies\r\nwere not excluded from the discussion on the matter--agreed that no\r\nbetter knight could be found for this purpose than Jacques de Lalaing,\r\nwho, on his part, was highly honoured by being selected to gauge the\r\nuntried capabilities of the prince.[7]\r\n\r\nIn the park at Brussels with the duke and duchess as onlookers, the\r\npreliminary encounter took place. At the very first attack, Charles\r\nstruck Messire Jacques on the shield and shattered his lance into many\r\npieces. The duke was displeased because he thought that the knight\r\nhad not exerted his full strength and was favouring his son. He\r\naccordingly sent word to Jacques that he must play in earnest and not\r\nhold his force in leash. Fresh lances were brought; again did\r\nthe count withstand the attack so sturdily that both lances were\r\nshattered. This time the boy's mother was the dissatisfied one,\r\nthinking that the knight was too hard with his junior, but the duke\r\nonly laughed.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus differed the parents. The one desired him to prove his\r\n    manhood, the other was preoccupied with his safety. With these\r\n    two courses the trial ended amid rounds of applause for the\r\n    prince.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe actual tourney was held on the market-place in Brussels before a\r\ndistinguished assembly. Count Charles was escorted into the arena by\r\nhis cousin, the Count d'Estampes, and other nobles. Seigneur d'Auxy,\r\nhis tutor, stood near to watch the maiden efforts of the prince and\r\nhis mates. He had reason to be proud of Charles, both for his bearing\r\nand his skill. He gave and received excellent thrusts, broke more\r\nthan ten lances, and did his duty so valiantly that in the evening he\r\nreceived the prize from two princesses, and \"Montjoye\" was cried\r\nby the heralds in his honour. From that time forth, the count was\r\nconsidered a puissant and rude jouster and gained great renown.\r\n\r\n    \"And that is the reason why I commence my memoirs about him and\r\n    his deeds[9] [continues La Marche, on concluding his description\r\n    of the tournament], and I do not speak from hearsay and rumour.\r\n    As one who has been brought up with him from his youth in his\r\n    father's service and in his own, I will touch upon his education,\r\n    his morals, his character, and his habits from the moment when I\r\n    first saw him as appears above in my memoirs.\r\n\r\n    \"As to his character, I will commence at the worst features. He\r\n    was hot, active, and impetuous: as a child he was very eager to\r\n    have his own way. Nevertheless, he had so much understanding and\r\n    good sense that he resisted his inclinations and in his youth no\r\n    one could be found sweeter or more courteous than he. He did not\r\n    take the name of God or the saints in vain, and held God in great\r\n    fear and reverence. He learned well and had a retentive memory. He\r\n    was fond of reading and of hearing read the stories of Lancelot\r\n    and Gawain, but to both he preferred the sea and boats. Falconry,\r\n    too, he loved and he hunted whenever he had leave. In archery he\r\n    early excelled his comrades and was good at other sports. Thus was\r\n    the count educated, trained, and taught, and thus did he devote\r\n    himself to good and excellent exercise.\"\r\n\r\nThat the report of the lavishness and extravagance of the Burgundian\r\ncourt was no idle rumour, exaggerated by frequent repetitions, is\r\nattested to by every bit of contemporary evidence. Enthusiastic and\r\nloyal chroniclers dwell on the magnificence, and the arid details of\r\nbills paid show what it cost to attain the vaunted perfection, while\r\nthe protests from taxpayers prove that this splendour did not grow\r\nlike the lilies of the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONTISPIECE OF AN ACCOUNT-BOOK XVTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nPhilip's treasury had many separate compartments. There were many\r\nquarters to which he could turn for his needed supplies, but there\r\nwere times when his exchequer ran very threateningly low, and his\r\nfinancial stress led him to be very conciliatory towards the burghers\r\nwith full purses.\r\n\r\nIn 1445, Ghent had been honoured by the celebration of the feast of\r\nthe Order of the Golden Fleece within her gates. Two years later,\r\nPhilip appeared in person at a meeting of the _collace_, or municipal\r\nassembly, and delivered a harangue to the Ghentish magistrates and\r\nburghers, flattering them, moreover, by using their vernacular. The\r\ntenor of this speech was as follows[10]:\r\n\r\n    \"My good and faithful friends, you know how I have been brought\r\n    up among you from my infancy. That is why I have always loved you\r\n    more than the inhabitants of all my other cities, and I have\r\n    proved this by acceding to all your requests. I believe then that\r\n    I am justified in hoping that you will not abandon me to-day when\r\n    I have need of your support. Doubtless you are not ignorant of the\r\n    condition of my father's treasury at the period of his death. The\r\n    majority of his possessions had been sold. His jewels were\r\n    in pawn. Nevertheless, the demands of a legitimate vengeance\r\n    compelled me to undertake a long and bloody war, during which the\r\n    defence of my fortresses and of my cities, and the pay of my\r\n    army have necessitated outlays so large that it is impossible to\r\n    estimate them. You know, too, that at the very moment when the war\r\n    on France was at its height, I was obliged, in order to assure the\r\n    protection of my country of Flanders, to take arms against the\r\n    English in Hainaut, in Zealand, and in Friesland, a proceeding\r\n    costing me more than 10,000 _saluts d'or,_ which I raised with\r\n    difficulty. Was I not equally obliged to proceed against Liege, in\r\n    behalf of my countship of Namur, which sprang from the bosom of\r\n    Flanders? It is not necessary to add to all these outlays those\r\n    which I assume daily for the cause of the Christians in Jerusalem,\r\n    and the maintenance of the Holy Sepulchre.\r\n\r\n    \"It is true, however, that, yielding to the persuasions of the\r\n    pope and the Council, I have now consented to put an end to the\r\n    evils multiplied by war by forgetting my father's death, and by\r\n    reconciling myself with the king. Since the conclusion of this\r\n    treaty, I considered that while I had succeeded in preserving\r\n    to my subjects during the war the advantages of industry and of\r\n    peace, they had submitted to heavy burdens in taxes and in\r\n    voluntary contributions, and that it was my duty to re-establish\r\n    order and justice in the administration. But everything went on as\r\n    though the war had not ceased. All my frontiers have been menaced,\r\n    and I found myself obliged to make good my rights in Luxemburg, so\r\n    useful to the defence of my other lands, especially of Brabant and\r\n    Flanders.\r\n\r\n    \"In this way, my expenses continued to increase; all my resources\r\n    are now exhausted, and the saddest part of it all is that the good\r\n    cities and communes of Flanders and especially the country folk\r\n    are at the very end of their sacrifices. With grief I see many of\r\n    my subjects unable to pay their taxes, and obliged to emigrate.\r\n    Nevertheless, my receipts are so scanty that I have little\r\n    advantage from them. Nor do I reap more from my hereditary lands,\r\n    for all are equally impoverished.\r\n\r\n    \"A way must be found to ease the poor people, and at the same time\r\n    to protect Flanders from insult, Flanders for whose sake I would\r\n    risk my own person, although to arrive at this end, important\r\n    measures have become imperative.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this affectionate preamble, Philip finally states that, in order\r\nto raise the requisite revenues, no method seemed to him so good and\r\nso simple as a tax on salt, three sous on every measure for a term of\r\ntwelve years. He promised to dispense with all other subsidies and to\r\nmake his son swear to demand nothing further as long as the _gabelle_\r\nwas imposed.\r\n\r\n    \"Know [he added in conclusion] that even if you consent to it I\r\n    will renounce it if others prove of a different opinion, for I do\r\n    not desire that the communes of Flanders be more heavily weighted\r\n    than any other portion of my territory.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke might have spared his trouble and his elaborate\r\ncondescension. The answer to his conciliatory request was a flat\r\nrefusal to consider the matter at all. Salt was a vital necessity to\r\nFlemish fisheries, and its cost could not be increased to the least\r\ndegree without serious inconvenience. The Flemings were wroth at his\r\nimitating the worst custom of his French kinsmen.\r\n\r\nPhilip departed from Ghent in great dudgeon. After a time he was\r\npersuaded that the indisposition of the town to meet his reasonable\r\nwishes was not due to the citizens at large, but to the machinations\r\nof a few unruly agitators among the magistrates. In 1449, therefore,\r\nhe took a high-handed course of trying to direct the issue of the\r\nregular municipal elections, so as to ensure the choice of magistrates\r\non whose obedience he could rely. The appearance of Burgundian troops\r\nin Ghent, before the election of mid-August, aroused the wrath of the\r\ncommunity, who thought that their most cherished franchises were in\r\njeopardy.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of a bitter struggle between Ghent and Philip.\r\nThe duke found it no light matter to coerce the independent burghers\r\ninto remembering that they were simply part of the Burgundian state.\r\n\"_Tantæ molis erat liberam gentem in servitutem adigere_!\" ejaculates\r\nMeyer in the midst of his chronicle of the details of fourteen months\r\nof active hostilities.[11] Matters were long in coming to an outbreak.\r\nVarious points had been contended over, when Philip had endeavoured\r\nto change the seat of the great council, or to take divers measures\r\ntending to concentrate certain judicial or legislative functions for\r\nhis own convenience, but in a manner prejudicial to the autonomy of\r\nGhent. His centripetal policy was disliked, but when his policy went\r\nfurther, and he attempted to control purely civic offices, dislike\r\ngrew into resentment and the Ghenters rose in open revolt.\r\n\r\nFor a time, their opposition passed in Philip's estimation as mere\r\ninsignificant unruliness. By 1452, however, the date of the tourney\r\nabove described, it became evident that a vital issue was at stake.\r\nThe Estates of Flanders endeavoured to mediate between overlord and\r\ntown, but without success. Owing to Philip's interference in the\r\nelections, the results were declared void, and when a new election was\r\nappointed, the Burgundians accused the city of hastily augmenting its\r\nnumber of legal voters by over-facile naturalisation laws. The gilds,\r\ntoo, evinced a readiness to be very lenient in their scrutiny of\r\ncandidates for admission to their cherished privileges, preferring,\r\nfor the nonce, numbers to quality. Occupancy of furnished rooms was\r\ndeclared sufficient for enfranchisement, and there were cases where\r\nmere guests of a bourgeois were hastily recorded on the lists as\r\nfull-fledged citizens.\r\n\r\nBy these means the popular party waxed very strong numerically. The\r\nsheriffs found themselves quite unequal to holding the rampant spirit\r\nof democracy in check. The regular government was overthrown, and the\r\ndemagogues succeeded in electing three captains _(hooftmans)_\r\ninvested with arbitrary power for the time being. The decrees of\r\nthe ex-sheriffs were suspended, and a mass of very radical measures\r\npromulgated and joyfully confirmed by the populace, assembled on the\r\nFriday market. It was to be the judgment of the town meeting that\r\nruled, not deputed authority. One ordinance stipulated that at the\r\nsound of the bell every burgher must hasten to the market-place, to\r\nlend his voice to the deliberations.\r\n\r\nFor a time various negotiations went on between Philip and envoys from\r\nGhent. The latter took a high hand and insinuated in unmistakable\r\nterms that if the duke refused an accommodation with them, they would\r\nappeal to their suzerain, the King of France. No act of rebellion,\r\novert or covert, exasperated Philip more than this suggestion. Charles\r\nVII. was only too ready to ignore those clauses in the treaty of\r\nArras, releasing the duke from homage, and virtually acknowledging his\r\ncomplete independence in his French territories. The king accepted\r\nmissives from his late vassal's city, without reprimanding the writers\r\nfor their presumption in signing themselves \"Seigneurs of Ghent.\"[12]\r\nHis action, however, was confined to mild attempts at mediation.\r\n\r\nIt was plain to the duke that his other towns would follow Ghent's\r\nresistance to his authority if there were hopes of her success.\r\nTherefore he threw aside all other interests for the time being, and\r\nexerted himself to levy a body of troops to crush Flemish pretensions.\r\nHis counsellors advised him to sound the temper of other citizens and\r\nto ascertain whether their sympathies were with Ghent. Answers of\r\nfeeble loyalty came back to him from the majority of the other towns.\r\nUndoubtedly they highly approved Ghent's efforts. They, too, could\r\nnot afford to pay taxes fraught with danger to their commerce, nor to\r\nrelinquish one jot of privileges dearly bought at successive crises\r\nthroughout a long period of years. The only doubt in their minds was\r\nas to the ultimate success of the burghers to stem the course of\r\nBurgundian usurpation. Therefore, they first hedged, and then\r\nconsented to aid the duke. This course was pursued by the Hollanders\r\nand the Zealanders, all alike short-sighted.\r\n\r\nThe Ghenters succeeded in possessing themselves of the castle of\r\nPoucque by force, and of the village of Gaveren by stratagem, taking\r\nadvantage in the latter case of the castellan's absence at church.\r\n\r\nWhen every part of his dominions had been canvassed for troops, and\r\nPhilip was prepared for his first active campaign against Ghent, he\r\nwas anxious to leave his heir under the protection of the duchess,\r\nconscious that the imminent contest would be bitter and deadly. A\r\npretence was made that the young count's accoutrements were not ready,\r\nand that, therefore, he would have to remain in Brussels.\r\n\r\n    \"But he whose ambitions waxed, hastened the completion of his\r\n    accoutrements, and swore by St. George, the greatest oath he ever\r\n    used, that he would rather go in his shirt than not accompany his\r\n    father to punish his impudent rebel subjects.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe approaching hostilities were watched by foreign merchants in dread\r\nof commercial disaster.\r\n\r\n    \"On May 18th, the _nations_[14] of the merchants of Bruges\r\n    departed thence to go to Ghent to try to make peace between that\r\n    city and the Duke of Burgundy, and there were _nations_ of Spain,\r\n    Aragon, Portugal, and Scotland, besides the Venetians, Milanese,\r\n    Genoese, and Luccans.\"[15]\r\n\r\nBut the men of Ghent were beyond the point where commercial arguments\r\ncould stem their course. The very day that this company arrived in the\r\ncity, the burghers sallied forth six or seven thousand strong, fully\r\nequipped for offensive warfare.\r\n\r\nBoth the actual engagements and guerilla skirmishes that raged over\r\na minute stretch of territory were characterised by an extraordinary\r\nferocity. Around Oudenarde, which town Philip was determined to\r\nrelieve, men were beheaded like sheep.\r\n\r\nIn the first regular engagement in which Charles took part, he showed\r\na brave front and learned the duties of a prince by rewarding others\r\nwith the honour of knighthood. Among those slain in the course of the\r\nwar, were Cornelius, Bastard of Burgundy, and the gallant Jacques\r\nde Lalaing. Philip grieved deeply over the death of the former, his\r\nfavourite among his natural sons, and buried him with all honours in\r\nthe Church of Ste-Gudule in Brussels. The title by which he was known,\r\nhardly a proud one it would seem, passed to his brother Anthony.\r\nLalaing, too, was greatly mourned, thus prematurely cut down in his\r\nthirty-third year.\r\n\r\nThere was so much fear lest the duke's sole legitimate heir might also\r\nperish in these conflicts where there was no mercy, that Charles was\r\npersuaded to go to visit his mother in the hope that she would keep\r\nhim by her side. She made a feast in his honour, but, to the surprise\r\nof all, the duchess, who had wished to protect her son from the mild\r\nperils of a tourney, now encouraged him with brave words to return\r\nto fight in all earnest for his inheritance.[16] He himself was very\r\nindignant at the efforts to treat him as a child.\r\n\r\nThe first truce and negotiations for peace, initiated in the summer of\r\n1452, were broken off because the conditions were unbearable to the\r\nGhenters. Another year of warfare followed before the decisive battle\r\nof Gaveren, in July, 1453, forced them sadly to succumb. There was\r\nno other course open to them. Not only were they defeated but their\r\nnumbers were decimated.[17] With full allowance for exaggeration, it\r\nis certain that the loss was very heavy. Terms scornfully rejected at\r\nan earlier date were, in 1453, accepted with every humiliating detail.\r\nMore, the defeated rebels were bidden to be grateful that their kind\r\nsovereign had imposed nothing further to the conditions. As to abating\r\nthe severity of the articles, he declared that he would not change an\r\n_a_ for a _b_.[18]\r\n\r\nThe chief provisions were as follows: The deans of the gilds were\r\ndeprived of participation in the election of sheriffs. The privileges\r\nof the naturalisation laws were considerably abridged. No sentence of\r\nbanishment could be pronounced without the intervention of the duke's\r\nbailiff, whose authorisation, too, was required before the publication\r\nof edicts, ordinances, etc. The sheriffs were forbidden to place their\r\nnames at the head of letters to the officers of the duke. The banners\r\nwere to be delivered to the duke and placed under five locks, whose\r\nseveral keys should be deposited with as many different people,\r\nwithout whose consensus the banners could not be brought forth to lead\r\nthe burghers to sedition. One gate was to be closed every Thursday in\r\nmemory of the day when the citizens had marched through it to attack\r\ntheir liege lord, and another was to be barred up in perpetuity or\r\nat the pleasure of their sovereign. To reimburse the duke for his\r\nenforced outlay, a heavy indemnity was to be paid by the city.\r\n\r\nJuly 30th was the date appointed for the final act of submission, the\r\n_amende honorable_ of the unfortunate city. The scene was very similar\r\nto that played at Bruges in 1440. Two thousand citizens headed by the\r\nsheriffs, councillors, and captains of the burgher guard met the\r\nduke and his suite a league without the walls of Ghent. Bareheaded,\r\nbarefooted, and divested of all their robes of office and of dignity,\r\nclad only in shirts and small clothes, these magistrates confessed\r\nthat they had wronged their loving lord by unruly rebellion, and\r\nbegged his pardon most humbly.\r\n\r\nThe duke spent the night of July 29th at Gaveren, prepared to march\r\nout in the morning with his whole army in handsome array. Philip was\r\nmagnificently apparelled, but he rode the same horse which he had used\r\non the day of battle, with the various wounds received on that day\r\nostentatiously plastered over to make a dramatic show of what the\r\ninjured sovereign had suffered at the hands of his disloyal subjects.\r\n\r\nThe civic procession was headed by the Abbot of St. Bavon and the\r\nPrior of the Carthusians. The burghers who followed the half-clad\r\nofficials were fully dressed but they, too, were barefoot and\r\nungirdled. All prostrated themselves in the dust and cried, \"Mercy on\r\nthe town of Ghent.\" While they were thus prostrate, the town spokesman\r\nof the council made an elaborate speech in French, assuring the\r\nduke that if, out of his benign grace. he would take his loving and\r\nrepentant subjects again into his favour, they would never again give\r\nhim cause for reproach.\r\n\r\n    \"At the conclusion of this harangue, the duke and the Count of\r\n    Charolais, there present, pardoned the petitioners for their evil\r\n    deeds. The men of Ghent re-entered their town more happy and\r\n    rejoiced than can be expressed, and the duke departed for Lille,\r\n    having disbanded his army, that every one might return to their\r\n    several homes.\" [19]\r\n\r\nThe joy experienced by the conquered, here described by La Marche, as\r\nhe looked back at the event from the calm retirement of his old age,\r\nwas not visible to all eye-witnesses. The progress of this war was\r\nwatched eagerly from other parts of Philip's dominion. His army was\r\nfull of men from both the Burgundies, who sent frequent reports to\r\ntheir own homes. Some passages from one of these reports by an unknown\r\nwar correspondent run as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"As to news from here, Monday after St. Magdalen's Day,\r\n    Monseigneur the duke got the better of the Ghenters near Gaveren\r\n    between ten and eleven o'clock. They attacked him near his\r\n    quarters.... The duke risked his own person in advance of his\r\n    company in the very worst of the slaughter, which lasted from the\r\n    said place up to Ghent, a distance of about two leagues. The slain\r\n    number three or four thousand, more or less, and those drowned in\r\n    the river of Quaux about two hundred.... This Tuesday, the date of\r\n    writing, the army departs from their quarters to advance on Ghent\r\n    to demand the conditions lately offered them, and the bearer of\r\n    this letter will tell you what is the result. M. the duke and\r\n    his army marched up to Ghent and I have seen the bearing of the\r\n    citizens. They are very bitter and despondent. M. the marshall has\r\n    been parleying. I hear that matters have been settled. I hear that\r\n    the Ghenters' loss is thirteen to fourteen thousand men. I\r\n    cannot write more for I have no time owing to the haste of the\r\n    messenger.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written July 23d. There is another despatch of July 31st,\r\ngiving the last news, which was \"very joyous.\" The public apology had\r\njust been enacted--\r\n\r\n    \"and afterwards, in token of being conquered and as a confession\r\n    that my said seigneur was victorious, those of Ghent have\r\n    delivered up all their banners to the number of eighty. And on\r\n    this day my said lord has created seven or eight knights and\r\n    heralds in honour of his triumph, which is inestimable.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThe duke's victory was certainly \"inestimable\" in its value to him,\r\nyet, in spite of the rigour enforced on this defeated people, they\r\nwere not as crushed as they might have been had they submitted in\r\n1445. Philip was clever enough to be more lenient than appeared at\r\nfirst. Ancient privileges were confirmed in a special compact, and the\r\nduke swore to maintain all former concessions in their entirety except\r\nin the points above specified. Liberty of person was guaranteed, and\r\nit was expressly stipulated that if the bailiff refused to sustain the\r\nsheriffs in their exercise of justice, or tried to arrogate to himself\r\nmore than his due authority, he should forfeit his office. Lastly, and\r\nmore important than all, the duke made no attempt to revive the demand\r\nfor the _gabelle_--salt was left free and untaxed. As a matter of\r\nfact, too, the duke was not exigeant in the fulfilment of every item\r\nof the treaty and, two years later, he increased certain privileges.\r\nHe had cut the lion's claws but he had no desire to pit his strength\r\nagain with Flemish communes. He had taught the audacious rebels a\r\nlesson and that sufficed him.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Blok, _Eene Hollandsche stad onder de Bourg.\r\nOostenrijksche Heerschappij,_ p. 84.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: La Marche, ii., 79, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See also _Chronijcke van Nederlant,_ p. 76, and\r\n_Vlaamsche Kronijk,_ p. 203.

Adolph of Cleves\r\ninaugurated the series with an entertainment where, among other\r\nthings, he delighted his friends by a representation of the tale of\r\nthe miraculous swan,[1] famous in the annals of his house for bringing\r\nthe opportune knight down the Rhine to wed the forlorn heiress.\r\n\r\nWhen his satisfied guests took their leave, Adolph placed a chaplet on\r\nthe head of one of the gentlemen, thus designating him to devise a new\r\namusement for the company; and under the invitation lurked a tacit\r\nchallenge to make the coming occasion more brilliant than the first.\r\nAgain and again was this process repeated. Entertainment followed\r\nentertainment, all a mixture of repasts and vaudeville shows in whose\r\npreparation the successive hosts vied with each other to attain\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe hard times, the stress of ready money, so eloquently painted when\r\nthe merchants were implored to take pity on their poverty-stricken\r\nlord, were cast into utter oblivion. It was harvest tide for skilled\r\ncraftsmen and artisans. Any one blessed with a clever or fantastic\r\nidea easily found a market for the product of his brain. He could see\r\nhis poetic or quaint conception presented to an applauding public with\r\na wealth of paraphernalia that a modern stage manager would not\r\nscorn. How much the nobles spent can only be inferred from the ducal\r\naccounts, which are eloquent with information about the creators of\r\nall this mimic pomp. About six sous a day was the wage earned by a\r\npainter, while the plumbers received eight. These latter were called\r\nupon to coax pliable lead into all sorts of shapes, often more\r\ngrotesque than graceful.\r\n\r\nOne fête followed another from the early autumn of 1453 to February,\r\n1454, when \"The Feast of the Pheasant,\" as the ducal entertainment was\r\ncalled, crowned the series with an elaborate magnificence that has\r\nnever been surpassed.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Philip possessed a genius for dramatic effect and it is\r\nmore than possible that he instigated the progressive banquets for the\r\nexpress purpose of leading up to the occasion with which he intended\r\nto dazzle Europe.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT OF ST. POL AND HIS JESTER]\r\n\r\nFor the duke's thoughts were now turned from civic revolts to a great\r\ninternational movement which he hoped to see set in motion. Almost\r\ncoincident with the capitulation of Ghent to Philip's will had been\r\nthe capitulation of Constantinople to the Turks. The event long\r\ndreaded by pope and Christendom had happened at last (May 29, 1453).\r\nAgain and again was the necessity for a united opposition to the\r\ninroads of the dangerous infidels urged by Rome. On the eve of St.\r\nMartin, 1453, a legate arrived in Lille bringing an official letter\r\nfrom the pope, setting forth the dire stress of the Christian Church,\r\nand imploring the mightiest duke of the Occident to be her saviour,\r\nand to assume the leadership of a crusade in her behalf against the\r\nencroaching Turk.[2]\r\n\r\nPhilip was ready to give heed to the prayer. Whatever the exact\r\nsequence of his plans in relation to the court revels, the result was\r\nthat his own banquet was utilised as a proper occasion for blazoning\r\nforth to the world with a flourish of trumpets his august intention of\r\ndislodging the invader from the ancient capital of the Eastern empire.\r\n\r\nThe superintendence of the arrangements for this all-eclipsing fête\r\nwas entrusted, as La Marche relates,\r\n\r\n    \"to Messire Jehan, Seigneur de Lannoy, Knight of the Golden\r\n    Fleece, and a skilful ingenious gentleman, and to one Squire Jehan\r\n    Boudault, a notable and discreet man. And the duke honoured me so\r\n    far that he desired me to be consulted. Several councils were held\r\n    for the matter to which the chancellor and the first chamberlain\r\n    were invited. The latter had just returned from the war in\r\n    Luxemburg already described.\r\n\r\n    \"These council meetings were very important and very private, and\r\n    after discussion it was decided what ceremonies and mysteries were\r\n    to be presented. The duke desired that I should personate the\r\n    character of Holy Church of which he wished to make use at this\r\n    assembly.\"\r\n\r\nAs in many half amateur affairs the preparations took more time than\r\nwas expected. At the first date set, all was not in readiness and the\r\nperformance was postponed until February 17th. This entailed serious\r\nloss upon the provision merchants and they received compensation for\r\nthe spoiled birds and other perishable edibles.[4]\r\n\r\nThe gala-day opened with a tournament at which Adolph of Cleves again\r\nsported as Knight of the Swan to the applause of the onlookers. After\r\nthe jousting, the guests adjourned to the banqueting hall, where fancy\r\nhad indeed, run riot, to make ready for their admiring eyes and their\r\nsagacious palates. _Entremets_ is the term applied to the elaborate\r\nset pieces and side-shows provided to entertain the feasters between\r\ncourses, and these were on an unprecedented scale.\r\n\r\nThree tables stood prepared respectively for the duke and his suite,\r\nfor the Count of Charolais, his cousins, and their comrades, and for\r\nthe knights and ladies. The first table was decorated with marvellous\r\nconstructions, among which was a cruciform church whose mimic clock\r\ntower was capacious enough to hold a whole chorus of singers. The\r\nenormous pie in which twenty-eight musicians were discovered when the\r\ncrust was cut may have been the original of that pasty whose opening\r\nrevealed four-and-twenty blackbirds in a similar plight. Wild animals\r\nwandered gravely at a machinist's will through deep forests, but in\r\nthe midst of the counterfeit brutes there was at least one live lion,\r\nfor Gilles le Cat[5] received twenty shillings from the duke for the\r\nchain and locks he made to hold the savage beast fast \"on the day of\r\nthe said banquet.\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was an anchored ship, manned with a full crew and rigged\r\ncompletely. \"I hardly think,\" observes La Marche, \"that the greatest\r\nship in the world has a greater number of ropes and sails.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the guests seated themselves they wandered around the hall\r\nand inspected the decorations one by one. Nor was their admiration\r\nexhausted when they turned to the discussion of the toothsome dainties\r\nprovided for their delectation.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the banquet, the story of Jason was enacted.\r\nTime there certainly was for the play. La Marche estimated forty-eight\r\ndishes to every course, though he qualifies his statement by the\r\nadmission that his memory might be inexact. These dishes were wheeled\r\nover the tables in little chariots before each person in turn.\r\n\r\n\"Such were the mundane marvels that graced the fête,\" is the\r\nconclusion of La Marche's[6] exhaustive enumeration of the\r\nmasterpieces from artists' workshops and ducal kitchen.\r\n\r\n    \"I will leave them now to record a pity moving _entremets_ which\r\n    seemed to be more special than the others. Through the portal\r\n    whence the previous actors had made their entrance, came a giant\r\n    larger without artifice than any I had ever seen, clad in a long\r\n    green silk robe, a turban on his head like a Saracen in Granada.\r\n    His left hand held a great, old-fashioned two-bladed axe, his\r\n    right hand led an elephant covered with silk. On its back was a\r\n    castle wherein sat a lady looking like a nun, wearing a mantle of\r\n    black cloth and a white head-dress like a recluse.[7]\r\n\r\n    \"Once within the hall and in sight of the noble company, like one\r\n    who had work before her, she said to the giant, her conductor:\r\n\r\n      \"'Giant, prithee let me stay\r\n        For I spy a noble throng\r\n        To whom I wish to speak.'\r\n\r\n     \"At these words her guide conducted his charge before the ducal\r\n    table and there she made a piteous appeal to all assembled to come\r\n    to rescue her, Holy Church, fallen into the hands of unbelieving\r\n    miscreants. As soon as she ceased speaking a body of officers\r\n    entered the hall, Toison d'Or, king-at-arms, bringing up the rear.\r\n    This last carried a live pheasant ornamented with a rich collar of\r\n    gold studded with jewels. Toison d'Or was followed by two maidens,\r\n    Mademoiselle Yolande, bastard daughter of the duke, and Isabelle\r\n    of Neufchâtel, escorted by two gentlemen of the Order. They all\r\n    proceeded to the host. After greetings, Toison d'Or then said:\r\n\r\n    \"'High and puissant prince and my redoubtable lord, here are\r\n    ladies who recommend themselves very humbly to you because it is,\r\n    and has been, the custom at great feasts and noble assemblies to\r\n    present to the lords and nobles a peacock or some other noble bird\r\n    whereon useful and valid vows may be made. I am sent hither with\r\n    these two demoiselles to present to you this noble pheasant,\r\n    praying you to remember them.'\r\n\r\n    \"When these words were said, Monseigneur the duke, who knew for\r\n    what purpose he had given the banquet, looked at the personified\r\n    Church, and then, as though in pity for her stress, drew from his\r\n    bosom a document containing his vow to succour Christianity, as\r\n    will appear later. The Church manifested her joy, and seeing that\r\n    my said seigneur had given his vow to Toison d'Or, she again burst\r\n    forth forth into rhyme:\r\n\r\n      \"'God be praised and highly served\r\n        By thee, my son, the foremost peer in France.\r\n        Thy sumptuous bearing have I close observed\r\n        Until it seemed thou wert reserved\r\n        To bring me my deliverance.\r\n        Near and far I seek alliance\r\n        And pray to God to grant thee grace\r\n        To work His pleasure in thy place.\r\n\r\n      \"'0 every prince and noble, man and knight,\r\n        Ye see your master pledged to worthy deed.\r\n        Abandon ease, abjure delight,\r\n        Lift up your hand, each in his right,\r\n        Offer God the savings from thy greed.\r\n        I take my leave, imploring each, indeed,\r\n        To risk his life for Christian gain,\r\n        To serve his God and 'suage my pain.'\r\n\r\n    \"At this the giant led off the elephant and departed by the same\r\n    way in which he had entered.\r\n\r\n    \"When I had seen this _entremets_, that is, the Church and a\r\n    castle on the back of such a strange beast, I pondered as to\r\n    whether I could understand what it meant and could not make it out\r\n    otherwise except that she had brought this beast, rare among us,\r\n    in sign that she toiled and laboured in great adversity in the\r\n    region of Constantinople, whose trials we know, and the castle in\r\n    which she was signified Faith. Moreover, because this lady was\r\n    conducted by this mighty giant, armed, I inferred that she wished\r\n    to denote her dread of the Turkish arms which had chased her away\r\n    and sought her destruction.\r\n\r\n    \"As soon as this play was played out, the noble gentlemen, moved\r\n    by pity and compassion, hastened to make vows, each in his own\r\n    fashion.\"\r\n\r\n    The vow of the Count of Charolais was as follows: \"I swear to God\r\n    my creator, and to His glorious mother, to the ladies and to the\r\n    pheasant, that, if my very redoubtable lord and father embark on\r\n    this holy journey, and if it be his pleasure that I accompany him,\r\n    I will go and will serve him as well as I can and know how to do.\"\r\n\r\nOther vows were less simple: all kinds of fantastic conditions being\r\nappended according to individual fancy. One gentleman decided never to\r\ngo to bed on a Saturday until his pledge were accomplished. Another\r\nthat he would eat nothing on Fridays that had ever lived until he\r\nhad had an opportunity of meeting the enemy hand to hand, and of\r\nattacking, at peril of his life, the banner of the Grand Turk.\r\n\r\nPhilip Pot vowed never to sit at table on a Tuesday and to wear no\r\nprotection on his right arm. This last the duke refused to permit.\r\nHugues de Longueval vowed that when he had once turned his face to the\r\nEast he would abstain from wine until he had plunged his sword in an\r\ninfidel's blood, and that he would devote two years to the crusade\r\neven if he had to remain all alone, provided Constantinople were not\r\nrecovered. Louis de Chevelast swore that no covering should protect\r\nhis head until he had come to within four leagues of the infidels,\r\nand that he would fight a Turk on foot with nothing on his arm but a\r\nglove. There was the same emulation in the vows as in the banquets and\r\nmany of the self-imposed penalties were as bizarre as the side-shows.\r\n\r\nThere were so many chevaliers eager to bind themselves to the\r\nenterprise that the prolonged ceremony threatened to become tedious.\r\nThe duke, therefore, declared that the morrow would be equally valid\r\nas the day.[8]\r\n\r\nThe Count of St. Pol was the only knight present who made his going\r\ndependent on the consent of the King of France, a condition very\r\ndispleasing to his liege lord of Burgundy.]\r\n\r\n    \"To abridge my tale [continues La Marche], the banquet was\r\n    finished and the cloth removed and every one began to walk\r\n    around the room. To me it seemed like a dream, for, of all the\r\n    decorations, soon nothing remained but the crystal fountain.\r\n    When there was no further spectacle to distract me, then my\r\n    understanding began to work and various considerations touching\r\n    this business came into my mind. First, I pondered upon the\r\n    outrageous excess and great expense incurred in a brief space by\r\n    these banquets, for this fashion of progressive entertainments,\r\n    with the hosts designated by chaplets, had lasted a long time. All\r\n    had tried to outshine their predecessors, and all, especially my\r\n    said lord, had spent so much that I considered the whole thing\r\n    outrageous and without any justification for the expense, except\r\n    as regarded the _entremets_ of the Church and the vows. Even that\r\n    seemed to me too lightly treated for an important enterprise.\r\n\r\n    \"Meditating thus I found myself by chance near a gentleman,\r\n    councillor and chamberlain, who was in my lord's confidence and\r\n    with whom I had some acquaintance. To him I imparted my thoughts\r\n    in the course of a friendly chat and his comment was as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"'My friend, I know positively that these chaplet entertainments\r\n    would never have occurred except by the secret desire of the duke\r\n    to lead up to this very banquet where he hoped to achieve a holy\r\n    purpose and to resist the enemies of our faith. It is three years\r\n    now since the distress of our Church was presented to the Knights\r\n    of the Golden Fleece at Mons. My lord there dedicated his person\r\n    and his wealth to her service. Since then occurred the rebellion\r\n    of Ghent, which entailed upon him a loss of time and money. Thanks\r\n    be to God, he has attained there a good and honourable peace, as\r\n    every one knows. Now it has chanced that, during this very period,\r\n    the Turks have encroached on Christianity still further in their\r\n    capture of Constantinople. The need of succour is very pressing\r\n    and all that you have witnessed to-day is proof that the good duke\r\n    is intent on the weal of Christendom.'\"\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of this conversation, a new company was ushered\r\ninto the hall, preceded by musicians. Here came _Grâce Dieu_, clad\r\nas a nun followed by twelve knights dressed in grey and black velvet\r\nornamented with jewels. Not alone did they come. Each gentleman\r\nescorted a dame wearing a coat of satin cramoisy over a fur-edged\r\nround skirt _à la Portuguaise. Grâce Dieu_ declared in rhyme that God\r\nhad heard the pious resolution of Duke Philip of Burgundy. He had\r\nforthwith sent her with her twelve attendants to promise him a happy\r\ntermination to his enterprise. Her ladies, Faith, Charity, Justice,\r\nReason, Prudence, and their sisters, were then presented to him.\r\n_Grâce Dieu_ departs alone and no sooner has she disappeared than\r\nPhilip's new attributes begin to dance to add to the good cheer. Among\r\nthe knights was Charles and one of his half-brothers; among the ladies\r\nwas Margaret, Bastard of Burgundy, and the others were all of high\r\nbirth. Not until two o'clock did the revels finally cease.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that La Marche's reflections upon the extravagance of\r\nthe entertainment occur also in Escouchy's memoirs. Probably both\r\ndrew their moralising from another author. It is stated by several\r\nreputable chroniclers that Olivier de la Marche himself represented\r\nthe Church. That he merely wrote her lines is far more probable.\r\nFemale performers certainly appeared freely in these as in other\r\nmasques, and there was no reason for putting a handsome youth in this\r\nrôle of the captive Church. In mentioning the plans that La Marche\r\nclaims to have heard discussed in the council meeting, he says plainly\r\nthat he was to play the rôle of Holy Church, but as he makes no\r\nfurther allusion to the fact, it may be dismissed as one of his\r\ncareless statements.\r\n\r\nThis pompous announcement of big plans was the prelude to nothing! Yet\r\nit was by no means a farce when enacted. Philip fully intended to\r\nmake this crusade the crowning event of his life, and his proceedings\r\nimmediately after the great fête were all to further that end. To\r\nobtain allies abroad, to raise money at home, and to ensure a peaceful\r\nsuccession for his son in case of his own death in the East--such were\r\nthe cares demanding the duke's attention.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-year-old Count of Charolais was entrusted with the regency\r\nfor the term of his father's sojourn abroad in quest of allies, and\r\nhe hastened to Holland to assume the reins of government, but he was\r\nspeedily recalled to Lille to submit once more to paternal authority\r\nbefore being left to his own devices and to maternal bias.\r\n\r\nFor the ducal pair disagreed seriously on the subject of their son's\r\nsecond marriage. Isabella wished that a bride should be sought in\r\nEngland, and this wish was apparently echoed by Charles himself. The\r\nimportant topic was discussed with more or less freedom among the\r\nyoung courtiers, until the drift of the conversations, whose burden\r\nwas wholly adverse to his own fixed purpose, came to Philip's ears,\r\ntogether with the information that one of his own children was among\r\nthose who incited the count to independent desires about his future\r\nwife. Very stern was the duke in his reprimand to the two young men.\r\nHe acknowledged that force of circumstances had once led him into\r\nfriendly bonds with the foes of his own France, but never had he been\r\n\"English at heart.\" Charles must accept his father's decision on pain\r\nof disinheritance. \"As for this bastard,\" Philip added, turning to the\r\nother son, destitute of status in the eyes of the law, \"if I find that\r\nhe counsels you to oppose my will, I will have him tied up in a sack\r\nand thrown into the sea.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe bride selected for the heir was Isabella of Bourbon, daughter\r\nof the duke's sister, and the betrothal was hastily made. Even the\r\napproval of the bride's parents was dispensed with. This passed the\r\nmore easily as the young lady herself was conveniently present in the\r\nBurgundian court under the guardianship of her aunt, the duchess,\r\nwho had superintended her education. A papal dispensation was more\r\nnecessary than paternal consent, but that, too, was waived as far as\r\nthe betrothal was concerned. To that extent was Philip obeyed. Then\r\nCharles returned to Holland and his father proceeded to Germany to\r\nobtain imperial co-operation in his Eastern enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe duke's departure from Lille was made very privately at five\r\no'clock in the morning. He was off before his courtiers were aware of\r\nhis last preparations. That was a surprise, but not the only one in\r\nstore for those left behind. In order to save every penny for his\r\njourney, Philip ordered radical retrenchment in his household\r\nexpenses. The luxurious repasts served to his retainers were abolished\r\nand all alike found themselves forced to restrict their appetites to\r\nthe dainties they could purchase with the table allowance accorded\r\nthem. \"The court's leg is broken,\" said Michel, the rhetorician.[10]\r\n\r\nIn his own outlay there was no stinting; the duke's progress was\r\npompous and stately as was his wont. As he traversed Switzerland,\r\nBerne, Zurich, and Constance asked and obtained permission to show\r\ntheir friendship with ceremonious receptions. Loud were the cries of\r\n\"_Vive Bourgogne_.\" Equally hospitable were the German cities. Game,\r\nwine, fodder, were offered for the traveller's use at every stage, as\r\nhe and his suite rode to the imperial diet.\r\n\r\nAt Ratisbon, disappointment greeted him. The emperor whom he had come\r\nso far to see in person failed to appear. Unwilling to accede to the\r\nplan of co-operation, afraid to give an open refusal, Frederic\r\nsimply avoided hearing the request. Essentially lazy, he shrank from\r\ncommitting himself to a difficult enterprise, nor was his ambition\r\ntempted by possible glory. It had cost no pang to refuse the crown\r\nof Bohemia and Hungary. But even had he been personally ambitious\r\nhe might still have been slow to lend his adherence to the duke's\r\nproject, in the not unnatural dread lest the flashing renown of the\r\ngreatest duke of the Occident might throw a poor emperor as ally\r\ninto the shade. The very warmth of Philip's reception in Germany had\r\nchilled Frederic. From a retreat in Austria, he sent his secretary,\r\nÆneas Sylvius, to represent him at Ratisbon, a substitution far from\r\npleasing to the visitor.\r\n\r\nThere were other defections, too, from the diet. None of those present\r\nwas in a position to aid Philip in furthering his schemes. The matter\r\nwas brought forward and laid on the table to be discussed at the next\r\ndiet, appointed to meet in November at Frankfort. But Philip would\r\nnot wait for that. Germany did not agree with him. He was not well.\r\nRumours there were of various kinds about his reasons for returning\r\nhome. They do not seem to require much explanation, however. He had\r\nnot been met half way in Germany and was highly displeased at the\r\nfailure. Declining all further entertainment proffered by the cities,\r\nhe travelled back to Besançon by way of Stuttgart and Basel. In the\r\nearly autumn he was at Dijon.\r\n\r\nDuring this summer, negotiations about Charles's marriage had\r\ncontinued. The Duke of Bourbon was inclined to chaffer about the dowry\r\ndemanded by Philip. One of the estates asked for was Chinon, and it\r\nwas urged that it, a male fief, was not capable of alienation. Philip\r\nwas not inclined to accept this reason as final and the negotiations\r\nhung fire, much to the distress of the Duchess of Bourbon, who feared\r\na breach between her husband and brother. Naïve are the phrases in one\r\nof her letters as quoted by Chastellain[11]:\r\n\r\n    \"MY VERY DEAR SEIGNEUR AND BROTHER,\r\n\r\n    \"I have heard all Boudault's message from you ... To be brief,\r\n    Monseigneur is content and ready to accede the points that you\r\n    demand. It seems to me that you ought to give him easy terms and\r\n    that you ought to put aside any grudge you may cherish against\r\n    him. Monseigneur, since I consider the thing as done, I beg you to\r\n    celebrate the nuptials as soon as possible although not without me\r\n    as you have promised me.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe king, too, was interested in the matter, and wrote as follows to\r\nDuke Philip:\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR AND MUCH LOVED BROTHER:\r\n\r\n    \"Some time ago my cousin of Bourbon informed me of the\r\n    negotiations for the marriage of my cousin of Charolais, your son,\r\n    to my cousin Isabella of Bourbon, his daughter, which marriage\r\n    has been deferred, as he writes me, because he does not wish to\r\n    alienate to his daughter the seignory of Château-Chinon. It is not\r\n    possible for him to do this on account of the marriage agreement\r\n    of our daughter Jeanne and my cousin of Clermont, his son, wherein\r\n    it was stipulated that Château-Chinon should go to them and their\r\n    heirs. Moreover, it cannot descend in the female line, and in\r\n    default of heirs male it must return to the crown as a true\r\n    appanage of France.\r\n\r\n    \"Lest, peradventure, you may doubt the truth of this, and imagine\r\n    that the point is urged by our cousin of Bourbon simply as an\r\n    excuse for not ceding the estate, we assure you that it is true,\r\n    and was considered in arranging the alliance of our daughter so\r\n    that it is beyond the power of our cousin of Bourbon to make any\r\n    alienation or transfer of the territory at the marriage of his\r\n    daughter. We never would have permitted the marriage of our\r\n    daughter without this express settlement. With this consideration\r\n    it seems to me that you ought not to block the marriage in\r\n    question, especially as my cousin says he is offering you an\r\n    equivalent. He cannot do more as we have charged our councillor,\r\n    the bailiff of Berry, to explain to you in full. So pray do not\r\n    postpone the marriage for the above cause or for any cause, if\r\n    by the permission of the Church and of our Holy Father it can be\r\n    lawfully completed.\r\n\r\n    \"Given at Romorantin, Oct. 17.\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES.[13]\r\n\r\n    CHALIGAUT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the marriage was an event of importance, and the circumstances\r\nare simple historic facts, it is strange that there should be any\r\nuncertainty regarding the details of its solemnisation. But there is a\r\ncertain vagueness about the narratives. One version is so amusing that\r\nit deserves a slight consideration.[14] The chronicler relates how\r\nCharles VII. felt some uneasiness at the delay in the negotiations.\r\nConscious of the sentiments of the Duchess of Burgundy, he feared\r\nlest her well-known sympathies for England might prevail in the final\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip had returned to Dijon, the bailiff of Berry came as the\r\nking's special envoy to discuss some aspects of the subject with him.\r\nThe mission was gladly undertaken as the messenger had never seen\r\nPhilip nor his court and he was pleased at the chance of meeting a\r\npersonage whose fame rang through Europe. Very graciously was he\r\nreceived by the duke, who read the king's letters attentively and\r\nreplied to the envoy's messages in general terms of courteous\r\nrecognition, without making his own intention manifest. The bailiff\r\nwaited for an answer, finding, in the meanwhile, that his days passed\r\nvery agreeably.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, before his arrival at Dijon Philip Pot had set\r\nout for the Netherlands, bearing the duke's orders to his son to\r\ncelebrate his nuptials without further delay. The duke did not intend\r\nto be influenced by any one. It was his will that his son should\r\naccept the bride selected and that was all sufficient. The reason why\r\nthe duke detained the king's messenger was that he \"awaited news from\r\nMessire Philip de Pot, whom he had sent in all speed to his son to\r\nhasten the wedding.\"[15] The said gentleman found the count at Lille\r\nwith the duchess, his mother, and he was so diligent in the discharge\r\nof his mission that he made all the arrangements himself and saw the\r\nwedding rites solemnised immediately. The bridegroom did not even know\r\nof the plan until the night preceding the important day. Then Philip\r\nPot rode back to Dijon.\r\n\r\nWhen the duke was assured that the alliance was irrevocably sealed\r\nhe was quite ready to answer the king's messenger, whom he at once\r\ninvited to an audience. In a casual fashion Philip remarked:\r\n\r\n\"Now bailiff, the king sent you hither about a matter which I am\r\nhumbly grateful for his interest in. You know my opinion. I had no\r\ndesire to dissemble. Here is a gentleman fresh from Flanders; ask him\r\nhis news and note his reply.\"\r\n\r\n\"What tidings, Monsieur, do you bring us?\r\n\r\nPrithee impart it\" said the bailiff to the chevalier. And the\r\ngentleman, laughing, replied: \"By my faith, Monsieur bailiff, the\r\ngreatest news that I know is that Monseigneur de Charolais is\r\nmarried!\"\r\n\r\n\"Married! to whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom?\" responded the chevalier, \"why, to his first cousin,\r\nMonseigneur's niece.\"\r\n\r\nMerry was the duke over the Frenchman's blank amazement. Again the\r\nlatter had to be reassured of the truth of the statement. Philip Pot\r\ntold him that it was so true that the wedded pair had spent the night\r\ntogether according to their lawful right.\r\n\r\nThe bailiff did not know which way to turn. \"So he acted out his\r\ntwo rôles. Returning thanks to the duke in the king's name with all\r\nformality, he then joined in the general laugh over the unsuspected\r\ntrick. He was a man of the world and knew how to take advantage of\r\nsense and of folly.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on the morrow of this hasty tying of the wedding knot that the\r\nCountess of Charolais sent a messenger to announce the fact to her\r\nparents. They seem to have been perfectly satisfied, made no further\r\nobjection to any point, and the mooted territory of Chinon made part\r\nof the dower in spite of the reasons urged against it.\r\n\r\nAs to the bailiff, when he made his adieux at Dijon, Philip presented\r\nhim with a round dozen stirrup cups, each worth three silver marks,\r\nand he went home a surprised and delighted man.\r\n\r\n    \"About this time [says Alienor de Poictiers] Monsieur de Charolais\r\n    married Mademoiselle de Bourbon and he married her on the eve of\r\n    All Saints[16] at Lille, and there was no festival because Duke\r\n    Philip was then in Germany. Eight days after the nuptials the\r\n    duchess gave a splendid banquet where were all the ladies of\r\n    Lille, but they were seated all together, as is usually done at\r\n    an ordinary banquet, without mesdames holding state as would have\r\n    been proper for such an occasion.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident from all the stories that Charles protested against his\r\nfather's orders as much as he dared and then obeyed simply because he\r\ncould not help himself.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, the unwilling bridegroom proved a faithful\r\nhusband in a court where marital fidelity was a rare trait.\r\n\r\nPhilip's plans for the international union against the Turk were less\r\neasily completed than those for the union of his son and his niece. In\r\nNovember, the diet met at Frankfort; the expedition was discussed and\r\nsome resolutions were passed, but nothing further was achieved.\r\n\r\nCharles VII. would not even promise co-operation on paper. He had\r\ngradually extended his own domain in French-speaking territory and had\r\ndislodged the English from every stronghold except Guisnes and Calais.\r\nUnder him France was regaining her prestige. Charles had much to lose,\r\ntherefore, in joining the undertaking urged by Philip and he was\r\nwholly unwilling to risk it. From him Philip obtained only expressions\r\nof general interest in the repulse of the Turks, and more definite\r\nsuggestions of the dangers that would menace Western Europe if all her\r\nnatural defenders carried their arms and their fortunes to the East.\r\n\r\nWhen the anniversary of the great fête came round not a vow was yet\r\nfulfilled!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A performance repeated in our modern Lohengrin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The chroniclers are not at one on this point.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: DuClercq, _Mémoires_, ii., 159.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This banquet at Lille was the subject of several\r\ndescriptions by spectators or at least contemporary authors.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Library at the Hague possesses a manuscript copied from an\r\nolder one which contains the order of proceedings together with the\r\ntext of all vows.

The opportunity to administer the government in his father's\r\nabsence changed him from a youth to a man, and the manner of man he\r\nwas, was plain to see.\r\n\r\nHis character was built on singularly simple lines. Vigorous of\r\nbody, intense of purpose, inclined to melancholy, he was profoundly\r\nconvinced of his own importance as heir to the greatest duke in\r\nChristendom, as future successor to an uncrowned potentate, who could\r\nafford to treat lightly the authority of both king and emperor whose\r\nnominal vassal he was.\r\n\r\nThe Ghent episode, too, undoubtedly had an immense effect in enhancing\r\nthe count's belief in his father's power, in causing him to forget\r\nthat the communes of Flanders did not owe their existence to their\r\noverlord. As yet, Charles of Burgundy had not met a single check to\r\nhis self-esteem, to his family pride. As a governor, he probably\r\nexercised his brief authority with the rigour of one new to the helm.\r\n\r\n    \"And the Count of Charolais bore himself so well and so virtuously\r\n    in the task, that nothing deteriorated under his hand, and when\r\n    the good duke returned from his journey, he found his lands as\r\n    intact as before.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, is La Marche's testimony.[1] Intact undoubtedly, but possibly\r\nthe satisfaction was not quite perfect. Du Clercq[2] declares that\r\nCount Charles acquitted himself honourably of his charge and made\r\nhimself respected as a magistrate. Above all, he insisted that justice\r\nshould be dealt out to all alike. The only danger in his methods was\r\nthat he acted on impulse without sufficiently informing himself of the\r\nmatter in hand, or hearing both sides of a controversy. As a result,\r\nhis decisions were not always impartial and the father was preferred\r\nto the strenuous and impetuous son. \"Not that Philip was often\r\ninclined to recognise other law than his own will, but he was more\r\ntranquil, more gentle than his son, and more guided by reason,\" adds\r\na later author.[2] There was an evident dread as to what might be the\r\noutcome of the count's untrained, youthful ardour.\r\n\r\nThe duke's chief measures after his return in February, 1455, seemed\r\nhardly calculated to arouse any great personal devotion to himself or\r\na profound trust that his first consideration was for the advantage of\r\nhis Netherland subjects. His thoughts were still turned to the East,\r\nand his main interest in the individual countships was as sources of\r\nsupply for his Holy War. Considerable sums flowed into his exchequer\r\nthat were never used for their destined purpose, but the duke cannot\r\nbe justly accused of actual bad faith in amassing them. His intention\r\nto make the Eastern campaign remained firm for some years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF CHARLES THE BOLD AT INNSBRUCK]\r\n\r\nIn another matter, his despotic exercise of personal authority, far\r\nwithout the pale of his jurisdiction inherited or acquired, shows no\r\nshadow of excuse.\r\n\r\nIn the bishropic of Utrecht the ecclesiastical head was also lay\r\nlord. Here the counts of Holland possessed no voice. They were near\r\nneighbours, that was all. Philip ardently desired to be more in this\r\ntiny independent state in the midst of territories acknowledging his\r\nsway.\r\n\r\nIn 1455, the see of Utrecht became vacant and Philip was most anxious\r\nto have it filled by his son David, whom he had already made Bishop of\r\nThérouanne by somewhat questionable methods. The Duke of Guelders\r\nalso had a neighbourly interest in Utrecht and he, too, had a pet\r\ncandidate, Stephen of Bavaria, whose election he urged. The chapter\r\nresolutely ignored the wishes of both dukes and the canons were almost\r\nunanimous in their choice of Gijsbrecht of Brederode.[4]\r\n\r\nA very few votes were cast for Stephen of Bavaria, but not a single\r\none for David of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nBrederode was already archdeacon of the cathedral and an eminently\r\nworthy choice, both for his attainments and for his character. He was\r\nproclaimed in the cathedral, installed in the palace, and confirmed,\r\nas regarded his temporal power, by the emperor.\r\n\r\nPhilip, however, refused to accept the returns, although not a single\r\nsuffrage had been cast by the qualified electors for his son. He\r\ndespatched the Bishop of Arras to Rome to petition the new pope,\r\nCalixtus III., to refuse to ratify the late election and to confer\r\nthe see upon David, out of hand. Philip's tender conscience found\r\nGijsbrecht ineligible to an episcopal office because he had\r\nparticipated in the war against Ghent, certainly a weak plea in an age\r\nof militant bishops!\r\n\r\nThe pope was afraid to offend the one man in Europe upon whose\r\nimmediate aid he counted in the Turkish campaign. He accepted the gift\r\nof four thousand ducats offered by Gijsbrecht's envoys, the customary\r\ngift in asking papal confirmation for a bishop-elect, but secretly\r\nhe delivered to Philip's ambassador letters patent creating David of\r\nBurgundy Bishop of Utrecht.[5]\r\n\r\nThe Burgundian La Marche states euphemistically that David was elected\r\nto the see, and the Deventer people would not obey him, therefore\r\nPhilip had to levy an army and come in person to support the new\r\nbishop.[6] Du Clercq puts a different colour on the story and\r\nd'Escouchy[7] implies that the whole trouble arose from party strife\r\nwhich had to be quelled in the interests of law and order.\r\n\r\nApart from any question of insult to the Utrechters by imposing upon\r\nthem a spiritual director of acknowledged base birth, the right of\r\nchoice lay with them and the emperor had confirmed their choice as far\r\nas the lay office was concerned. While the issue was undecided, the\r\nEstates of Utrecht appointed Gijsbrecht guardian and defender of the\r\nsee to assure him a legal status pending the papal ratification. The\r\npeople were prepared to support their candidate with arms, a game that\r\nPhilip did not refuse, and the force of thirty thousand men with which\r\nhe invaded the bishopric proved the stronger argument of the two and\r\nable to carry David of Burgundy to the episcopal throne, upon which he\r\nwas seated in his father's presence, October 16, 1455.\r\n\r\nSome of Philip's allies reaped certain advantages from the situation.\r\nAlkmaar and Kennemerland redeemed certain forfeited privileges by\r\nmeans of their contributions to the duke's army. The city of Utrecht\r\npreferred a compromise to the risk of war. The bishop-elect,\r\nGijsbrecht, consented to withdraw his claim, being permitted to retain\r\nthe humbler office of provost of Utrecht and an annuity of four\r\nthousand guilders out of the episcopal revenues.\r\n\r\nDeventer was the only place which was obstinate enough to persist in\r\nher rebellion and Philip was engaged in bringing her citizens to terms\r\nby a siege when news was brought to him that a visitor had arrived at\r\nBrussels under circumstances which imperatively demanded his personal\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty years that had elapsed since the Treaty of Arras, there\r\nhad been great changes in France in the character both of the realm\r\nand of the ruler. Little by little the latter had proved himself to\r\nbe a very different person from the inert king of Bourges.[8] Old at\r\ntwenty, Charles VII. seemed young and vigorous at forty. Bad advisers\r\nwere replaced by others better chosen and his administration gradually\r\nbecame effective. Fortune favoured him in depriving England of the\r\nDuke of Bedford (1435), the one man who might have maintained English\r\nprestige abroad and peace at home during the youth of Henry VI. It was\r\nat a time of civil dissensions in England, that Charles VII. succeeded\r\nin assuming the offensive on the Continent and in wresting Normandy\r\nand Guienne from the late invader.\r\n\r\nBut this territorial advantage was not all. Distinct progress had been\r\nmade towards a national existence in France. The establishment of\r\nthe nucleus of a regular army was an immense aid in curbing the\r\ndepredations of the \"_écorcheurs_,\" the devastating, marauding\r\nbands which had harassed the provinces. There was new activity in\r\nagriculture and industry and commerce.[9] The revival of letters and\r\nart, never completely stifled, proved the real vitality of France in\r\nspite of the depression of the Hundred Years' War. Royal justice was\r\nreorganised, public finance was better administered. By 1456, misery\r\nhad not, indeed, disappeared, but it was less dominant.\r\n\r\nThe years of growing union between king and his kingdom were, however,\r\nyears of discord between Charles and his son. The dauphin Louis had\r\nnot enjoyed the pampered, petted life of his Burgundian cousin. Very\r\npoor and forlorn was his father at the time of the birth of his heir\r\n(1423).[10] There was nothing in the treasury to pay the chaplain who\r\nbaptised the child or the woman who nourished him. The latter received\r\nno pension as was usual but a modest gratuity of fifteen pounds.\r\nThe first allowance settled on the heir to his unconsecrated royal\r\nfather's uncertain fortunes was ten crowns a month. Every feature of\r\nhis infancy was a marked contrast to the early life of the Count of\r\nCharolais.\r\n\r\nFrom his seventeenth year Louis was in active opposition to the\r\nking, heading organised rebellion against him in the war called\r\nthe _Praguerie_. Finally, Charles VII. entrusted to his charge the\r\nadministration of Dauphiné, thus practically banishing him honourably\r\nfrom the court where he was, evidently, a disturbing element. The only\r\nrestrictions placed upon him in his provincial government were such\r\nas were necessary to preserve the ultimate authority of the crown. To\r\nthese restrictions, however, Louis paid not the slightest heed. He\r\nassumed all the airs of an independent sovereign. He made wars and\r\ntreaties with his neighbours and at last proceeded to arrange his own\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nAt this time Louis was already a widower, having been married at the\r\nage of thirteen to Margaret of Scotland, who led a mournful existence\r\nat the French court, where she felt herself a desolate alien. Her\r\ndeath at the age of twenty was possibly due to slander. \"Fie upon\r\nlife,\" she said on her deathbed, when urged to rouse herself to resist\r\nthe languor into which she was sinking. \"Talk to me no more of it.\"\r\n\r\nHer husband cared less for her life than did Margaret herself. He took\r\nno interest in the inquiry set on foot to ascertain the truth of the\r\ncharges against the princess, and was more than ready to turn to a new\r\nalliance. At the date of his widowerhood he was in Dauphiné and his\r\nown choice for a wife was Charlotte, daughter of the Duke of Savoy.\r\nAfter negotiations in his own behalf he informed his father of his\r\nmatrimonial project. It did not meet the views of Charles VII., who\r\nordered his son to abandon the idea immediately.\r\n\r\nA messenger was despatched post haste to Chambéry to stop the\r\ndauphin's nuptials.[11] The duke evaded an interview and the envoy was\r\nforced to deliver his letter to the chancellor of Savoy. On the morrow\r\nof his arrival, he was taken to church, where the wedding ceremony was\r\nperformed (March 10, 1451), but his seat was in such a remote place\r\nthat he could barely catch a glimpse of the bridal procession, though\r\nhe saw that Louis was clad in crimson velvet trimmed with ermine. Two\r\ndays later the envoy carried a pleasant letter to the king, expressing\r\nregrets on the part of the Duke of Savoy that the alliance was made\r\nbefore the paternal prohibition arrived.\r\n\r\nNine years were spent by Louis in Dauphiné. He introduced many\r\nadministrative and judicial reforms, excellent in themselves but not\r\npopular. There were various protests and when he dared to impose taxes\r\nwithout the consent of the Estates, an appeal was made to the king\r\nbegging him to check his son in his illegal assumptions. Charles\r\nsummoned his son to his presence. Instead of obeying this order in\r\nperson, Louis sent envoys who were dismissed by his father with a curt\r\nresponse: \"Let my son return to his duty and he shall be treated as a\r\nson. As to his fears, security to his person is pledged by my word,\r\nwhich my foes have never refused to accept.\"[12]\r\n\r\nLouis showed himself less compliant than his father's foes. As Charles\r\napproached Dauphiné, and made his preparations to enforce obedience,\r\nLouis appealed to the mediation of the pope, of the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nand of the King of Castile, beside sending offerings to all the chief\r\nshrines in Christendom, imploring aid against parental wrath. Then\r\nhis thoughts took a less peaceful turn. He called the nobles of his\r\nprincipality to arms and bade the fortified towns prepare for siege,\r\nwhile he loftily declared that he would not trouble his father to seek\r\nhim. He would meet him at Lyons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Count of Dammartin was directed by the king to take\r\nmilitary possession of Dauphiné and to put the dauphin under arrest.\r\nAs he was _en route_ to fulfil these orders, the count heard that\r\na day had been set by Louis for a great hunt. That an excellent\r\nopportunity might be afforded for securing his quarry in the course\r\nof the chase, was the immediate thought of the king's lieutenant. So\r\nthere might have been had not the wily hunter received timely warning\r\nof the project for making _him_ the game.\r\n\r\nAt the hour appointed for the meet, the dauphin's suite rode to the\r\nrendezvous, but the prince turned his horse in the opposite direction\r\nand galloped away at full speed, attended by a few trusty followers.\r\nHe hardly stopped even to take breath until he was out of his father's\r\ndomain, and made no pause until he reached St. Claude, a small town\r\nin the Franche-Comté, where he threw himself on the kindness of the\r\nPrince of Orange.\r\n\r\nHow gossip about this strange departure of the French heir fluttered\r\nhere and there! Du Clercq[13] tells the story with some variation from\r\nthe above outline, laying more stress on the popular appeal to the\r\nking for relief from Louis's transgressions as governor of Dauphiné,\r\nand enlarging on the accusation that Louis was responsible for the\r\ndeath of _La belle Agnès_, \"the first lady of the land possessing the\r\nking's perfect love.\" He adds that the dauphin was further displeased\r\nbecause the niece of this same Agnes, the Demoiselle de Villeclerc,\r\nwas kept at court after her aunt's death. Wherever the king went he\r\nwas followed by this lady, accompanied by a train of beauties. It was\r\nthis conduct of his father that had forced the son to absent himself\r\nfrom court life for twelve years and more, during which time he\r\nreceived no allowance as was his rightful due, and thus he had been\r\nobliged to make his own requisitions from his seigniory.\r\n\r\nThere were other reports that the king was quite ready to accord his\r\nson his full state; others, again, that Charles drove Louis into exile\r\nfrom mere dislike and intended to make his second son his heir and\r\nsuccessor. At this point Du Clercq's manuscript is broken off abruptly\r\nand the remainder of his conjectures are lost to posterity. Where the\r\ntext begins again, the author dismisses all this contradictory hearsay\r\nand says in his own character as veracious chronicler, \"I concern\r\nmyself only with what actually occurred. The dauphin gave a feast\r\nin the forest and then departed secretly to avoid being arrested by\r\nDammartin.\"\r\n\r\nThis flight was the not unnatural termination of a long series of\r\nmisunderstandings between a father whose private conduct was not above\r\ncriticism, and a son, clever, unscrupulous, destitute of respect for\r\nany person or thing except for the superstitious side of his religion.\r\n\r\nCharles VII. was a curious instance of a man whose mental development\r\noccurred during the later years of his life. When his son was under\r\nhis personal influence his character was not one to instil filial\r\ndeference, and Louis certainly cherished neither respect nor affection\r\nfor the father whose inert years he remembered vividly.\r\n\r\nWhether, indeed, the dauphin had any part in Agnes Sorel's death which\r\ngave him especial reason to dread the king's anger, is uncertain, but\r\nof his action there is no doubt. To St. Claude he travelled as rapidly\r\nas his steed could go, and from that spot on Burgundian soil he\r\ndespatched the following exemplary letter to his father:\r\n\r\n    \"MY VERY REDOUBTABLE LORD:\r\n\r\n    \"To your good grace I recommend myself as humbly as I can. Be\r\n    pleased to know, my very redoubtable lord, that because, as you\r\n    know, my uncle of Burgundy intends shortly to go on a crusade\r\n    against the Turk in defence of the Catholic Faith and because my\r\n    desire is to go, your good pleasure permitting, considering that\r\n    our Holy Father the Pope bade me so to do, and that I am standard\r\n    bearer of the Church, and that I took the oath by your command, I\r\n    am now on my way to join my uncle to learn his plans so that I can\r\n    take steps for the defence of the Catholic Faith.\r\n\r\n    \"Also, I wish to implore him to find means of reinstating me in\r\n    your good grace, which is something that I desire most in the\r\n    world. My very redoubtable lord, I pray God to give you good life\r\n    and long.\r\n\r\n    \"Written at St. Claude the last day of August.\r\n\r\n    \"Your very humble and obedient son,\r\n\r\n    \"LOYS.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter hardly succeeded in carrying conviction to the king.\r\nHe characterised the projected expedition to Turkey as a farce, a\r\npretence, and a frivolous excuse.[15] Probably, too, he did not\r\ncontradict his courtiers when they declared that the project had\r\nbeen in the wind a long time, and that the Duke of Burgundy would\r\nbe prouder than ever to have the heir to France dependent on his\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe epistle despatched, Louis continued his journey under the escort\r\nof the Seigneur de Blaumont, Marshal of Burgundy, at the head of\r\nthirty horse. Their pace was rapid to elude the pursuit of Tristan\r\nl'Hermite. The prince needed no spurs to make him flee. Even if his\r\nfather did not intend to have him drowned in a sack his immediate\r\nliberty was certainly in jeopardy. \"In truth this thing was a\r\nmarvellous business. The Prince of Orange and the Marshal of Burgundy\r\nwere the two men whom the dauphin hated more than any one else,\r\nbut necessity, which knows no law, overcame the distaste of the\r\ndauphin.\"[16]\r\n\r\nLouvain was the next place where Louis felt safe enough to rest. Here\r\nhe wrote to the Duke of Burgundy to announce his arrival within his\r\nterritory. The letter found Philip in camp before Deventer. It is\r\nevident that he was entirely taken by surprise, and was prepared to be\r\nvery cautious in his correspondence with the French king. He assured\r\nhim that he was willing to receive and honour Louis as his suzerain's\r\nheir, but he implored that suzerain not to blame him, the duke, for\r\nthat heir's flight to his protection.\r\n\r\nHis envoy, Perrenet, was charged with many reassuring messages in\r\naddition to the epistle. Before he reached the French court, his\r\nnews was no novelty. Rumour had preceded him. The messenger was very\r\neloquent in his assurances to the king that Philip was wholly innocent\r\nin the affair and a good peer and true. Perrenet\r\n\r\n    \"stayed at the French court until Epiphany and I do not know what\r\n    they discussed, but during that time news came that the king had\r\n    garrisoned Compiègne, Lyons, and places where his lands touched\r\n    the duke's territories. When the envoy returned to the duke, he\r\n    published a manifesto ordering all who could bear arms to be in\r\n    readiness.\"[17]\r\n\r\nPhilip sent messages of welcome to Louis with apologies for his\r\nown inevitable absence, and the visitor was profuse in his return\r\nassurances to his uncle that he understood the delay and would not\r\ndisturb his business for the world. \"I have leisure enough to wait and\r\nit does not weary me. I am safe in a pleasant land and in a fine town\r\nwhich I have long wished to see.\" He showed his courtesy when the\r\nCount d'Étampes, Philip's nephew-in-law, presented his suite, by\r\npronouncing each individual name and assuring its bearer that he had\r\nheard about him.[18]\r\n\r\nThe count was commissioned to conduct the dauphin to Brussels and we\r\nhave the story of an eye-witness of his reception by the ladies of the\r\nducal family:\r\n\r\n    \"I saw the King of France, father of the present King Charles,\r\n    chased away by his father Charles for some difference of which\r\n    they say that the fair Agnes was the cause, and on account of\r\n    which he took refuge with Duke Philip, for he had no means of\r\n    subsistence.[19]\r\n\r\n    \"The said King Louis, being dauphin, came to Brussels accompanied\r\n    by about ten cavaliers and by the Marshal of Burgundy. At this\r\n    time Duke Philip was at Utrecht in war and there was no one to\r\n    receive the visitor but Madame the Duchess Isabella and Madame\r\n    de Charolais, her daughter-in-law, pregnant with Madame Mary of\r\n    Burgundy, since then Duchess of Austria.\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur the dauphin arrived at Brussels, where were the ladies,\r\n    at eight o'clock in the evening, about St. Martin's Day.[20] When\r\n    the ladies heard that he was in the city they hastened down to the\r\n    courtyard to await him. As soon as he saw them he dismounted and\r\n    saluted Madame the Duchess and Mme. de Charolais and Mme. de\r\n    Ravestein. All kneeled and then he kissed the other ladies of the\r\n    court.\"\r\n\r\nAlienor goes on to describe how a whole quarter of an hour was\r\nconsumed by a friendly altercation between Isabella and her guest as\r\nto the exact way in which they should enter the door, the dauphin\r\nresolute in his refusal to take precedence and Isabella equally\r\nresolute not even to walk by the side of the future king. \"Monsieur,\r\nit seems to me you desire to make me a laughing stock, for you wish\r\nme to do what befits me not.\" To this the dauphin replied that it was\r\nincumbent upon him to pay honour for there was none in the realm of\r\nFrance so poor as he, and that he would not have known whither to flee\r\nif not to his uncle Philip and to her.\r\n\r\nLouis prevailed in his argument, and hostess and guest finally\r\nproceeded hand in hand to the chamber prepared for the latter and\r\nIsabella then took leave on bended knee.\r\n\r\nWhen the duke returned to Brussels this contention as to the proper\r\netiquette was renewed. Isabella tried to retain the dauphin in his own\r\napartment so that the duke should greet him there as befitted their\r\nrelative rank. She was greatly chagrined, therefore, when Louis\r\nrushed down to the courtyard on hearing the signs of arrival. This\r\npunctilious hostess actually held the prince back by his coat to\r\nprevent his advancing towards the duke.\r\n\r\nThroughout the visit the minor points of etiquette were observed with\r\nthe utmost care. Both duchess and countess refrained from employing\r\ntheir train-bearers when they entered the dauphin's presence. When he\r\ninsisted that his hostess should walk by his side, she managed her own\r\ntrain if possible. If she accepted any aid from her gentlemen she was\r\nvery careful to keep her hand upon the dress, so that technically she\r\nwas still her own train-bearer. Then, too, when the duchess ate in the\r\ndauphin's presence, there was no cover to her dish and nothing was\r\ntasted in her behalf.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy had to supply Louis with every requisite, but he,\r\ntoo, never forgot for a moment that this dependent visitor was future\r\nmonarch of France. Without doors as within, every minor detail of\r\netiquette was observed. The duke never so far forgot himself in the\r\nardour of the chase as to permit his horse's head to advance beyond\r\nthe tail of the prince's steed.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1457, on St. Valentine's Eve, Mary of Burgundy was born.\r\nOur observant court lady describes in detail the ceremonial observed\r\nin the chamber of the Countess of Charolais and at the baptism.\r\nBrussels rang with joyful bells and blazed with torches, four hundred\r\nsupplied by the city ahd two hundred by the young father. Each torch\r\nweighed four or five pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Charolais was his own messenger to announce the birth of\r\nhis daughter to the dauphin and to ask him to stand god-father. Joyful\r\nwas Louis to accept the invitation and to bestow his mother's name on\r\nthe baby-girl. Ste. Gudule was so far from the palace that the Church\r\nof the Caudenberg was selected for the ceremony and richly adorned\r\nwith Holland linen, velvet, and cloth of gold. The duchess carried her\r\ngrandchild to the font,--a font draped with cramoisy velvet.\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur the dauphin stood on the right and I heard it said that\r\n    there was no one on the left because there was none his equal. On\r\n    that day, the duchess wore a round skirt _à la Portuguaise_, edged\r\n    with fur. There was no train of cloth nor of silk, so I cannot\r\n    state who carried it,\"\r\n\r\nsagely remarks Alienor with incontrovertible logic.\r\n\r\nLater events made later chroniclers less enthusiastic about the honour\r\npaid to Mademoiselle[21] Mary by the dauphin. In a manuscript of La\r\nMarche's _Mémoires_ at The Hague, the words \"Lord! what a god-father!\"\r\nappear in the margin of the page describing the baptism.[22] But in\r\nthese early days of his five years' sojourn, Louis seems to have been\r\na pleasant person and to have posed as the ruined poor relation,\r\nentirely free from pride at his high birth and delighted to repay\r\nhospitality by his general complaisance.\r\n\r\nCharles VII. received all the reports with somewhat cynical amusement.\r\nHe had no great trust in his son. \"Louis is fickle and changeable and\r\nI do not doubt that he will return here before long. I am not at all\r\npleased with those who influence him,\" are his words as quoted by\r\nd'Escouchy.[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS XI FROM THE ENGRAVING BY A. BOILLY, AFTER THE\r\nDRAWING BY J. BOILLY]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, though, the king was much surprised at his son's action.\r\nHe had rather expected him to take refuge somewhere but he never\r\nthought that the Duke of Burgundy would be his protector--a strange\r\nchoice to his mind. \"My cousin of Burgundy nourishes a fox who will\r\neat his chickens\" is reported as another comment of this impartial\r\nfather.[24] Like many a phrase, possibly the fruit of later harvests,\r\nthis is an excellent epitome of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I.,ch. xxxi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2:II.,204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Barante, vi.,50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Some of the canons wrote their reasons after their\r\nrecorded vote: \"Because Duke Philip had made the candidate member\r\nof his council of Holland, Zealand, and Friesland, in which office\r\nGijsbrecht had acquitted himself well.\" \"Because all the Sticht nobles\r\nwere his relations,\" etc.--(Wagenaar, _Vaderlandsche Historie,_ iv.,\r\n50.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Du Clercq, ii., 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Mémoires_, i., ch. xxxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: II., 315.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See Lavisse, iv^{ii}., 317.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: For the effects of operations on a large scale see\r\n_Jacques Coeur and Charles VII_., by Pierre Clémart.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Duclos_, \"Hist. de Louis XI.,\" _OEuvres Complètes_ v.,\r\n8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Duclos, iii., 78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See Lavisse, iv^{ii}., 292.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: II.,223.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Lettres de Louis XI_., i., 77.\r\n\r\nAccording to the editor, Vaesen, the original of this letter shows\r\nthat _September 2nd_ was written first and erased.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Chastellain, iii., 185.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Du Clercq, ii., 228.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Chastellain iii., 197.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: See _Séjour de Louis XI. aux Pays-Bas;_ Reiffenberg:\r\nNouveaux mem. de l'Acad.

Before Mary's birth, however, an\r\nincident had occurred, betraying the fact that the dauphin and Charles\r\nVII. were not the only father and son between whom relations were\r\nstrained, and that a moment had arrived when the attitude of the Count\r\nof Charolais to the duke was no longer characterised by unquestioning\r\nfilial obedience.\r\n\r\nCharles was on his way to Nuremberg[1] to fulfil a mission with\r\ncertain German princes when the dauphin alighted in Brabant, like \"a\r\nbird of ill omen,\" as he designated himself on one occasion. The count\r\ndid not return to Brussels until January 12, 1457. Thus he took no\r\npart in the hearty welcome accorded to the visitor. It is more than\r\npossible that the heir of Burgundy was not wholly pleased with the\r\nstate of affairs placidly existing by mid-winter.\r\n\r\nInstead of resuming the first position which he had enjoyed during his\r\nbrief regency, or the honoured second that had been his after Philip\r\ncame back, Charles was now relegated to a third place. Further,\r\nwithout having been consulted as to the policy, he found that he\r\nwas forced into following his father's lead in treating a penniless\r\nrefugee like an invited guest, whose visit was an honour and a joy. It\r\nis more than probable that Charles was already feeling somewhat hurt\r\nat the duke's warmth towards Louis when a serious breach occurred\r\nbetween father and son about another matter.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that a chamberlain's post fell vacant in his own household,\r\nand the count assumed that the appointment of a successor was\r\nsomething that lay wholly within his jurisdiction. When the duke\r\ninterfered in a peremptory fashion and insisted that the appointment\r\nshould be made at his instance, the son refused to accept his\r\nauthority, especially as his father's nominee was Philip de Croy, one\r\nof a family already over-dominant in the Burgundian court. At least,\r\nthat was Charles's opinion. Therefore, when he obeyed his father's\r\ncommands to bring his _ordonnance_, or household list, to the duke's\r\noratory, he unhesitatingly carried the document which contained the\r\nname of Antoine Raulin, Sire d'Émeries, in place of Philip de Croy.\r\n\r\nThe duke was very angry at this apparent contempt for his expressed\r\nwishes. Indignantly he threw the lists into the fire with the words,\r\n\"Now look to your _ordonnances_ for you will need new ones[2].\"\r\n\r\nThere was evidently a succession of violent scenes in which the\r\nduchess tried to stand between her husband and son. But Philip was\r\nbeside himself with wrath and refused to listen to a word from her or\r\nfrom the dauphin, who also endeavoured to mediate[2].\r\n\r\nFinally, the irate duke lost all control of himself, ordered a horse,\r\nand rode out alone into the forest of Soignies. When he became calmer\r\nit was dark and he found himself far from the beaten tracks, in the\r\nmidst of underbrush through which he could not ride. He dismounted and\r\nwandered on foot for hours in the January night until smoke guided him\r\nto a charcoal burner, who conducted him to the more friendly shelter\r\nof a forester's hut. In the morning he made his way to Genappe.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the palace, consternation reigned. Search parties seeking\r\ntheir sovereign were out all night. No one, however, was in such a\r\nstate of dismay as the dauphin, who declared that he would be counted\r\nat fault when family dissensions followed so soon on his arrival.\r\nDelighted he was, therefore, to act as mediator between father and\r\nson after the duke was in a sufficiently pacified state to listen to\r\nreason. Charles betook himself to Dendermonde for a time until the\r\nduke was ready to see him[4]. His young wife made the most of her\r\nexpectations to soften her father-in-law's resentment, and between\r\nher entreaties and those of the guest, proud to show his tact and his\r\ngratitude, the quarrel was at last smoothed over.\r\n\r\nThere was one marked difference between this family dispute and the\r\nbreach between the French king and the dauphin. In the latter case no\r\nfeeling was involved. In the former, the son was really deeply wounded\r\nby what he deemed lack of parental affection for his interests. At the\r\nsame time he was shocked by the bitter words and was, for the moment,\r\nso filled with contrition that he was eager to make any concession\r\nagreeable to the duke. He dismissed two of his servants[5], suspected\r\nby his father of fomenting trouble between them, and he showed himself\r\nin general very willing to placate paternal displeasure.\r\n\r\nReconciliation between duke and duchess was more difficult. Isabella\r\nresented Philip's reproaches for her sympathy with Charles. She said\r\nshe had stepped between the two men because she had feared lest the\r\nduke might injure his son in his wrath[6]. This was in answer to the\r\nMarshal of Burgundy when he was telling her of Philip's displeasure.\r\nShe concluded her dignified defence with an expression of her utter\r\nloneliness. Stranger in a strange land she had no one belonging to her\r\nbut her son.\r\n\r\nShe was certainly present at the baptism of her grandchild, but\r\nshortly afterwards she retired to a convent of the Grey Sisters,\r\nfounded by herself, and rarely returned to the world or took part in\r\nits ceremonies during the remainder of her life.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel, too, left its scar upon Charles. It is not probable that\r\nhe had much personal liking for the guest upon whom his father heaped\r\ncourtesies and solicitous care. On one occasion, when the two young\r\nmen were hunting they were separated by chance. When Charles returned\r\nalone to the palace, the duke was full of reproaches at his son's\r\ncareless desertion of the guest in his charge. Again the court was\r\norganised into search parties and there was no rest until the dauphin\r\nwas discovered some leagues from Brussels[7]. Here, also, it is an\r\neasy presumption that the Count of Charolais was a trifle sulky over\r\nhis father's preoccupation in regard to the prince.\r\n\r\nThe transient character of the dauphin's sojourn in his cousin's\r\ndomains soon changed. In the summer of 1457, when news came that\r\nDauphiné had submitted to Charles VII., when the successive embassies\r\ndespatched by Philip to the king had all proved fruitless in their\r\nconciliatory efforts, Philip proceeded to make more permanent\r\narrangements for the fugitive's comfort.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, Monseigneur, since the king has been pleased to deprive you\r\n    of Dauphiné ... you are to-day lord and prince without land. But,\r\n    nevertheless, you shall not be without a country, for all that I\r\n    have is yours and I place it within your hand without reserving\r\n    aught except my life and that of my wife. Pray take heart. If God\r\n    does not abandon me I will never abandon you[8].\"\r\n\r\nThe duke made good his words by giving his guest the estate of\r\nGenappe, of which Louis took possession at the end of July. Then as a\r\nfurther step to make things pleasant for the exile, Philip sent for\r\nCharlotte of Savoy who had remained under her father's care ever since\r\nthe formal marriage in 1451. She was now eighteen.\r\n\r\nIt was an agreeable spot, this estate at Genappe. Louis's favourite\r\namusement of the chase was easy of access. \"The court is at present\r\nat Louvain,\" wrote a courtier[9] on July 1st, \"and Monseigneur the\r\nDauphin likes it very much, for there is good hunting and falconry and\r\na great number of rabbits within and without the city.\" With killing\r\nof every kind at his service, what greater solace could a homeless\r\nprince expect?\r\n\r\nFrom Louvain to Genappe is no great distance, and the sum of 1200\r\nlivres, furnished by Philip for the dauphin's journey to his new\r\nabode, seemed a large provision. The pension then settled on him was\r\n36,000 livres, and when the dauphiness arrived 1000 livres a month\r\nwere provided for her private purse[10].\r\n\r\nPleasant was existence in this château. There was no dearth of company\r\nto throng around the prince in exile, and the dauphin allowed no\r\nprejudice of mere likes and dislikes, no consideration of duty towards\r\nhis host to hamper him in making useful friends. A word here and\r\na word there, aptly thrown in at a time when Philip's anger had\r\nexasperated, when Charles had failed to conciliate, were very potent\r\nin intimating to many a Burgundian servant that there might come a\r\ntime when a new king across the border might better appreciate their\r\nreal value than their present or future sovereign.\r\n\r\nHunting was a favourite amusement, but the dauphin did not confine his\r\ninvitations to sportsmen. The easy accessibility of the little court\r\nattracted men of science and of letters as well as others capable of\r\nmaking the time pass agreeably. When there was nothing else on foot,\r\nit is said that the company amused themselves by telling stories,\r\neach in turn, and out of their tales grew the collection of the _Cent\r\nNouvelles Nouvelles_[11], named in imitation of Boccaccio's _Cento\r\nNovelle_.\r\n\r\nThe first printed edition of this collection was issued in Paris, in\r\n1486, by Antoine Verard, who thus admonishes the gentle reader: \"Note\r\nthat whenever _Monseigneur_ is referred to, Monseigneur the Dauphin\r\nmust be understood, who has since succeeded to the crown and is King\r\nLouis. Then he was in the land of the Duke of Burgundy.\" Another\r\neditor asserts that _Monseigneur_ is evidently the Duke of Burgundy\r\nand not Louis, and later authorities decide that Anthony de la Sale\r\nwrote the whole collection in imitation of Boccaccio, and that the\r\nnames of the narrators were as imaginative or rather as editorial as\r\nthe rest of the volume.\r\n\r\nIf this be true, it maybe inferred that the author would have given an\r\nappearance of verisimilitude to his fiction by mentioning the actual\r\nhabitués of the dauphin's court. The name of the Count of Charolais\r\ndoes not appear at all. The duke tells three or more stories according\r\nto the interpretation given to _Monseigneur_. With three exceptions\r\nthe tales are very coarse, nor does their wit atone for their\r\nlicentiousness. Possibly Charles held himself aloof from the kind of\r\ntalk they suggest. All reports make him rigid in standards of morality\r\nnot observed by his fellows. That he had little to do with the court\r\nis certain, whatever his reason.\r\n\r\nLouis did not confine himself to the estate assigned him. There were\r\nvarious court visits to the Flemish towns where he was afforded\r\nexcellent opportunities for seeing the wealth of the burghers and\r\ntheir status in the world of commerce.\r\n\r\nGhent was very anxious to have the duke bring his guest within her\r\ngates and give her an opportunity of displaying her regret for the\r\npast unpleasantness. \"In his goodness,\" Philip at last yielded to\r\ntheir entreaties to make them a visit himself, but he decided not to\r\ntake the prince or the count with him.[12] He was either afraid for\r\ntheir safety or else he did not care to bring a future French king\r\ninto relation with citizens who might find it convenient to remember\r\nhis suzerainty in order to ignore the wishes of their sovereign\r\nduke.[13]\r\n\r\nEastertide, 1458, was finally appointed for this state visit of\r\nreconciliation. The duke took the precaution to send scouts ahead to\r\nascertain that the late rebels were sincere in their contrition, and\r\nthat there was no danger of anarchist agitations. The report was\r\nbrought back that all was calm and that joyful preparations were\r\nmaking to show appreciation of Philip's kindness.\r\n\r\nOn April 22d, the duke slept at l'Écluse, and on the 23d he was gaily\r\nescorted into the city by knights and gentlemen summoned from Holland,\r\nHainaut, and Flanders, \"but neither clerks nor priests were in his\r\ntrain.\" As a further assurance to him of their peaceful intention,\r\nthe citizens actually lifted the city gates off their hinges so as to\r\nleave open exits.\r\n\r\nOnce within the walls, the duke found the whole community, who had\r\nshown intelligent and sturdy determination not to endure arbitrary\r\ntyranny, ready to weave themselves into a frenzy of biblical and\r\nclassical parable whose one purpose was to prove how evil had been\r\ntheir ways. A pompous procession sang _Te Deum_ as the duke rode in,\r\nand the first \"mystery\" that met his eyes within the gates was a\r\nwonderful representation of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, while the\r\nlegend \"All that the Lord commanded we will do,\" was meant not to\r\nrefer to the Hebrew's fidelity to Jehovah, but to the Ghenters'\r\nperfect submission to Philip. A young girl stood ready to greet him\r\nwith the words of Solomon, \"I have found one my soul loves.\"[14]\r\n\r\nAll the legends were in Latin. _Inveni quem diligit anima mea._]\r\n\r\nFarther on there were various emblems all designed to compare\r\nPhilip now to Cæsar, now to Pompey, now to Nebuchadnezzar. The most\r\nhumiliating spectacle was that of a man dressed in a lion's skin,\r\nthus personifying the Lion of Flanders, leading Philip's horse by the\r\nbridle. \"_Vive Bourgogne_ is now our cry,\" was symbolised in every\r\nvehicle which the rhetoricians could invent.\r\n\r\nNot altogether explicable is this extreme self-abnegation. Civic\r\nprosperity must have returned in four years or there would have been\r\nno money for the outlay. Apparently, Philip's countenance was worth\r\nmore to them than their pride.\r\n\r\nThe birth and death of two children at Genappe gave the duke new\r\nreasons for showering ostentatious favours on his guest, and furnished\r\nthe dauphin with suitable occasion for addressing his own father, who\r\nanswered him in kind.\r\n\r\nThe following is one of the fair-phrased epistles[l5]:\r\n\r\n  _The King to the Dauphin_, 1459.\r\n    \"VERY DEAR AND MUCH LOVED SON:\r\n\r\n    \"We have received the letters that you wrote us making mention\r\n    that on July 27 our dear and much loved daughter, the dauphiness,\r\n    was delivered of a fine boy, for which we have been and are very\r\n    joyous, and it seems to me that the more God our Creator grants\r\n    you favour, by so much the more you ought to praise and thank\r\n    Him and refrain from angering Him, and in all things fulfil His\r\n    commandments.\r\n\r\n    \"Given at Compiègne, Aug.7th.\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these five years, Charles was more or less aloof from the\r\ncourts of his father and of their guest. He spent part of the time in\r\nHolland and part at Le Quesnoy with his young wife. The Count of St.\r\nPol was one of his intimate friends, and a friend who managed to\r\nmake many insinuations about the duke's treatment of his son and\r\ninfatuation about the Croys whom Charles hated with increasing\r\nfervency.\r\n\r\nThere is a story that Charles went from Le Quesnoy to his father's\r\ncourt to demand a formal audience from the duke in order to lodge his\r\nprotest against the Croys. Evidently relations were strained when such\r\na degree of ceremony was needed between father and son.\r\n\r\nGerard Ourré was commissioned to set forth the count's grievances, and\r\nhe was in the midst of his carefully prepared statement when the duke\r\ninterrupted him with the curt observation: \"Have a care to say nothing\r\nbut the truth and understand, it will be necessary to prove every\r\nassertion.\" The orator was discomfited, stammered on for a few\r\nmoments, and then excused himself from completing his harangue.\r\nThere were only a few nobles present and all were surprised at this\r\nembarrassment, as Gerard passed for a clever man. Then, seeing that\r\nhis deputy was too much frightened to proceed, Charles took up the\r\nthread of his discourse. In a firm voice he continued the list of\r\naccusations against the Croys, only to be cut short in his turn.\r\nPeremptory was the duke in his command to his son to be silent and\r\nnever again to refer to the subject. Then, turning to Croy, Philip\r\nadded \"see to it that my son is satisfied with you,\" and withdrew from\r\nthe audience chamber.\r\n\r\nCroy addressed Charles and endeavoured to be conciliatory. \"When you\r\nhave repaired the ill you have wrought I will remember the good you\r\nhave done,\" was the count's only reply. He took leave of his father\r\nwith an outward show of love and respect and returned to his wife at\r\nLe Quesnoy, escorted, indeed, by Croy out of the gates of Brussels,\r\nbut with no better understanding between them.\r\n\r\nSt. Pol found good ground to work on. He inflamed the count's\r\ndiscontent and his distrust of the duke's favourite until Charles\r\ndespatched him to Bourges on a confidential mission to ascertain what\r\nCharles VII. would do for the heir of Burgundy should he decide to\r\ntake refuge in the French court.[16]\r\n\r\nAt the first interview \"I was not present,\" states the unknown\r\nreporter, but on succeeding occasions this man heard for himself that\r\nthe king was ready to show hospitality to the Count of Charolais who\r\n\"has no ill intentions against his father. All he wants to do is to\r\nseparate him from the people who govern him badly.\"\r\n\r\nThe conferences were held in the lodgings of Odet d'Aydie. Among those\r\npresent was Dammartin and the matter was discussed in its various\r\naspects. Jehan Bureau and the anonymous witness were charged with\r\ndrawing up a report of the discussion. When this was presented to the\r\nking it did not seem to him good. He doubted the good faith of the\r\ncount's message. He had been assured that it was all a fiction\r\nespecially designed by the Sieur de Burgundy.\r\n\r\nCertain general promises were made in spite of this royal distrust,\r\nquite natural under the circumstances. If he decided to espouse the\r\ncause of Henry VI., the Count of Charolais should be given a command.\r\nIt was evident that the count was by no means ready to go to all\r\nlengths, for St. Pol states in one of his conferences with the \"late\r\nking\" that Charles of Burgundy had assured him that for two realms\r\nsuch as his he would not do a deed of villainy.\r\n\r\nNothing came of this talk. It would have been a singular state of\r\naffairs had the heirs of France and Burgundy thus changed places in\r\ntheir fathers' courts. Spying and counterspying there were between\r\nthe courts to a great extent and rumours in number. A certain Italian\r\nwrites to the Duke of Milan as follows, on March 23, 1461, after he\r\nhad been at Genappe and at Brussels:[17]\r\n\r\n    \"M. de Croy has given me clearly to understand that the\r\n    reconciliation of the dauphin with the King of France would not be\r\n    with the approval of the Duke of Burgundy. Nevertheless the prince\r\n    laments that since he received the dauphin into his states,\r\n    and treated him as his future sovereign, he has incurred the\r\n    implacable hatred of the king added to his ancient grievances. On\r\n    the other hand, the affairs of England, on whose issue depends war\r\n    or peace for the duke, being still in suspense, it did not seem to\r\n    him honest to make advances to the king at this moment.\r\n\r\n    \"M. de Croy thinks that the dauphin does not seem to have carried\r\n    into this affair the circumspection and reflection befitting a\r\n    prince of his quality. He has maintained towards the duke the\r\n    most complete silence on the affair of Genoa, and the proposition\r\n    concerning Italy. Croy does not think there is anything in it,\r\n    but if the thing were so it ought not to be secret. He does not\r\n    believe that peace will be made between the dauphin and his\r\n    father, and mentioned that his brother was on the embassy from\r\n    duke to king, in order, I suppose, to probe the matter to the\r\n    bottom.\r\n\r\n    \"The dauphin it seems has been out of humour with the Duke of\r\n    Burgundy on account of the luke-warmness shown for his interests\r\n    by the ambassador sent by this prince to the Duke of Savoy.\r\n\r\n    \"The silent agreement which reigns between the dauphin and Monsg.\r\n    de Charolais is one of the causes which has chilled this great\r\n    love between the dauphin and the duke which existed at the\r\n    beginning.\r\n\r\n    \"Moreover, the dauphin having spent largely, especially in\r\n    almsgiving without considering his purse finds himself very hard\r\n    pressed. He has only two thousand ducats a month from the Duke of\r\n    Burgundy and that seems to force him into peace with the king. The\r\n    duke expects nothing during the king's lifetime.\r\n\r\n    \"Everything makes me want to wait here for the arrival of news\r\n    from England. It is expected daily, good or bad the last play must\r\n    be made. The duke fears a descent on Calais, and for this reason\r\n    is going to a town called St. Omer. Under pretext of celebrating\r\n    there the fête of the Toison d'Or he has ordered all his escort to\r\n    be armed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP THE GOOD AND CHARLES THE BOLD. FROM A\r\nCONTEMPORARY SKETCH IN MS.]\r\n\r\nFor a long time before his final illness the death of Charles VII. was\r\nanticipated. When it came it was a dolorous end.[18] At Genappe, the\r\ndauphin had been making his preparations for the wished-for event in\r\nmany ways, all in exact opposition to his father's policy. In Italy\r\nand in Spain he sided with the opponents of Charles VII. In England,\r\nhis sympathies were all for the House of York because his father was\r\nfavourable to Henry of Lancaster and Margaret of Anjou. He learned\r\nwith satisfaction of the success of Edward IV., and was more than\r\nwilling to see him invade France. With certain princes of Germany he\r\nentertained relations shrouded in mystery, while his father's own\r\nagents disclosed secrets to him from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn his exile he kept reminding official bodies at Paris that he was\r\nheir to the throne. As dauphin he claimed the right to give orders to\r\nthe _parlement_ at Grenoble. There is no actual proof that he had a\r\nhand in the conspiracies which troubled the last year of his father's\r\nreign, but it is certain that he managed to win to himself a party\r\nwithin the royal circle.\r\n\r\nCertain councillors, fearful of their own fate, did not hesitate to\r\nsuggest that Louis should be disinherited and his brother Charles put\r\nin his stead, but this Charles VII. would not accept. He kept hoping\r\nfor Louis's submission. The latter, however, had no idea of this. He\r\nwas sure that his father would not live to grow old. A trouble in his\r\nleg threatened to be cancerous. In July, there was a growth in his\r\nmouth. He died July 22nd, convinced that his son had poisoned him.\r\n\r\nAfter July 17th constant bulletins from the king's bedside came to\r\nLouis. Genappe was too far and the anxious son moved to Avesnes\r\nin order to receive his messages more speedily. Our chronicler\r\nChastellain[19] begins his story of Louis's accession as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Since I am not English but French, I who am neither Spanish nor\r\n    Italian but French, I have written of two Frenchmen, the one king,\r\n    the other duke. I have written of their works and their quarrels\r\n    and of the favour and glories which God has given them in their\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Kings die, reigns vanish but virtue alone and meritorious works\r\n    serve man on his bier and gain him eternal glory. O you Frenchmen,\r\n    see the cause and the end in my labours!\"\r\n\r\nThe guest who had displayed so much humility and thankfulness when he\r\narrived, who had deprecated honours to his high birth and desired to\r\noffer all the courtesies, departed from the residence so generously\r\ngiven him for five years in a very cavalier manner.\r\n\r\n    \"Now the king left the duke's territories without having taken\r\n    leave nor said adieu to the Countess of Charolais,[20] although he\r\n    was in her neighbourhood, and he left behind him the queen, his\r\n    wife. The said queen had neither hackneys nor vehicles with which\r\n    to follow her husband. Therefore, the king ordered her to borrow\r\n    the hackneys of the countess and chariots, too. Heartily did the\r\n    countess accede to this request in spite of the fact that the\r\n    thing seemed to her rather strange that a noble king, and one who\r\n    had received so much honour and service from the House of Burgundy\r\n    and had promised to recognise it when the hour came, should thus\r\n    depart thence without saying a word. However, in spite of all, the\r\n    countess would gladly have given the queen the hackneys as a gift\r\n    if they had been asked, and she sent them to her by one of her\r\n    equerries named Corneille de la Barre, together with chariots and\r\n    waggons. And thus the queen left the country just as her husband\r\n    had done without saying a word either to the duke or the countess,\r\n    and Corneille went with her on foot to bring back the hackneys\r\n    when the queen had arrived at the place of her desire.\"\r\n\r\nPhilip had difficulty in persuading his quondam guest to show outward\r\nrespect to his father's memory. The duke clad himself and his suite\r\nin deep mourning before setting out to join Louis at Avesnes, whither\r\nrepresentatives from the University of Paris and from all parts of the\r\nrealm had flocked to greet their new sovereign.\r\n\r\nIt was a great concourse that marched from Avesnes as escort to the\r\nuncrowned king. Philip was magnificent in his appointments as he\r\nentered Rheims, and behind him came his son,\r\n\r\n    \"the Count of Charolais who, equally with his noble company of\r\n    knights and squires, attracted hearts and eyes in admiration of\r\n    his rich array wherein cloth of gold and jewelry, velvet and\r\n    embroidery were lavishly displayed. And the count had ten pages\r\n    and twenty-six archers, and this whole company numbered three\r\n    hundred horse.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThis was a Thursday after dinner. Louis had waited at St. Thierry. On\r\nthe actual day of the coronation, preliminaries absorbed so much time\r\nthat the long cavalcade did not enter Rheims until seven o'clock. The\r\nking passed his night in a very pious and prayerful manner, taking no\r\nrepose until 5 A.M. While his suite were occupied at their toilets he\r\nslipped off alone to church.\r\n\r\nFinally all was ready for the grand ceremony. Very magnificent were\r\nthe duke's robes and ermine when, as chief among the peers, he\r\nescorted his late guest to be consecrated king, and very devout and\r\nsimple was Louis. After the consecration, the king and his friends\r\nlistened to an address from the Bishop of Tournay, in which he\r\ndescribed in Latin the dauphin's sojourn in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy was the hero of the occasion. He felt that all\r\nfuture power was in his hands and that Louis XI. could never do enough\r\nto repay him for his wonderful hospitality. And for a time Louis was\r\nquite ready to foster this belief. When they entered Paris, the peer\r\nso far outshone the sovereign that there was general astonishment.[22]\r\nMoreover, whatever the latter did have was a gift. The very plate used\r\non the royal table was a ducal present.[23]\r\n\r\nLouis took great pains to preserve an attitude of grateful humility.\r\nWhen he met the _parlement_ of Paris, he asked the duke's advice about\r\nits reformation. It was to Philip that all the petitioners flocked.\r\nBut Louis was conscious, too, that there would be a morrow in\r\nBurgundy, and he took care to be friendly with the count even while he\r\nwas flattering the duke. For this purpose he found Guillaume de Biche\r\na very useful go-between.[24] This was one of the retainers dismissed\r\nin 1457 by Charles at his father's request. He had then passed into\r\nLouis's service. This man quickly insinuated himself into the king's\r\ngraces, was admitted to his chamber at all hours, and walked arm in\r\narm with the returned exile through Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Burgundian exile had learned the mysteries of the city well in\r\nhis four years' residence. Louis found him an amusing companion and\r\nskilfully managed to flatter the count by his favour towards the man\r\nwhom he had liked.\r\n\r\nFor six weeks Philip remained in the capital and astonished the\r\nParisians with the fêtes he offered. Equally astonished were they\r\nwith their new monarch. Louis was thirty-eight and not attractive in\r\nperson. His eyes were piercing but his visage was made plain by a\r\ndisproportionate nose. His legs were thin and misshapen, his gait\r\nuncertain. He dressed very simply, wearing an old pilgrim's hat,\r\nornamented by a leaden saint. As he rode into Abbeville in company\r\nwith Philip, the simple folk who had never seen the king were greatly\r\namazed at his appearance and said quite loud, \"Benedicite! Is that a\r\nking of France, the greatest king in the world? All together his horse\r\nand dress are not worth twenty francs.\"[25]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Louis XI. never lived very long in\r\nany one place. He did not like the Louvre as a dwelling and had\r\nthe palace of the Tournelles arranged for him. Touraine became by\r\npreference his residence, where he lived alternately at Amboise and\r\nin his new château at Plessis-lès-Tours. But his sojourns were always\r\nbrief. He wanted to know everything, and he wandered everywhere to\r\nsee France and to seek knowledge. His letters, his accounts, the\r\nchroniclers, the despatches of the Italian ambassador, show him on a\r\nperpetual journey.\r\n\r\nHe would set out at break of day with five or six intimates dressed in\r\ngrey cloth like pilgrims; archers and baggage followed at a distance.\r\nHe would forbid any one to follow him, and often ordered the gates of\r\nthe city he had left to be closed, or a bridge to be broken behind\r\nhim. Ambassadors ordered to see him without fail, sometimes had to\r\ncross France to obtain an interview, at least if their object was\r\nsomething in which he was not much interested. Then he would often\r\ngrant them an audience in some miserable little peasant hut.\r\n\r\nIn the cities where he stopped he would lodge with a burgomaster or\r\nsome functionary. To avoid harangues and receptions he would often\r\narrive unannounced through a little alley. If forced to accept an\r\n_entrée_ he stipulated that it should not be marked with magnificence.\r\nThere never was a prince who so disliked ceremonies, balls, banquets,\r\nand tourneys. At his court young people were bored to death. He never\r\nordered festivals except for some visitor; his pleasures were those\r\nof a simple private gentleman. He liked to dine out of his palace.\r\nCagnola relates with surprise that he had seen the king dine after\r\nmass in a tavern on the market-place at Tours. He invited small nobles\r\nand bourgeois to dine with him. He was intimate, too, with bourgeois\r\nwomen, and indulged in gross pleasantries, speaking to and of women\r\nwithout reserve, sparing neither sister, mother, nor queen.\r\n\r\nYet it was a sombre court. \"Farewell dames, citizens, demoiselles,\r\nfeasts, dances, jousts, and tournaments; farewell fair and gracious\r\nmaids, mundane pleasures, joys, and games,\" says Martial d'Auvergne.\r\nPompous magnificence may have reminded Louis unpleasantly of his visit\r\nto Burgundy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: He had departed with Adolph de la Marck on November\r\n19th.--_Archives du Nord_. See Du Fresne de Beaucourt, vi., 113. No\r\nmention of this seems to appear elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Chastellain (iii., 233) says that he heard the story from\r\nthe clerk of the chapel, sole witness of this family quarrel.

The rich rewards confidently\r\nexpected as fitting recompense for five years' kindness more than\r\ncousinly, towards a penniless refugee were not forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe king was lavish in fine words, and not chary in certain\r\nostentatious recognition towards his late host, but the fairly\r\nmunificent pension, together with the charge of Normandy settled upon\r\nthe Count of Charolais, proved only a periodical reminder of promises\r\nas regularly unfulfilled on each recurring quarter day, while the post\r\nof confidential adviser to the inexperienced monarch, which Philip had\r\nintended to occupy, remained empty.\r\n\r\nLouis put perfect trust in no one but turned now to one counsellor,\r\nnow to another, and used such fragments of advice as pleased his whim\r\nand paid no further heed to the giver.\r\n\r\nNot long after Louis's coronation there occurred that change in\r\nPhilip's bodily constitution that comes to all active men sooner or\r\nlater. His health began to give way, his energies relaxed, and matters\r\nthat had been of paramount importance throughout his career were\r\nallowed to slip into the background of his desires. In the famous\r\ntreaty of 1435, no article was rated at greater importance than that\r\nwhich placed the towns on the Somme in Philip's hands, subject to a\r\nredemption of two hundred thousand gold crowns. Whether Charles VII.\r\nhad actually pledged himself that the mortgage should hold at least\r\nduring Philip's life does not seem assured, but that any sum would be\r\ninsufficient to induce the duke to release them unless his intellect\r\nwere somewhat deadened, is clear.\r\n\r\nIn 1462, when he recovered from a sharp attack, possibly the result\r\nof his indulgence in the pleasures of the table during the prolonged\r\nfestivities at Paris, he did not regain his previous vigour. This was\r\nthe time, by the way, when opportunity was afforded his courtiers to\r\nprove that devotion to their seigneur outweighed personal vanity. When\r\nhis head was shaved by order of the court physician, more than five\r\nhundred nobles sacrificed their own locks so that their becoming curls\r\nmight not remind their chief of his own bald head. The sacrifice was\r\nnot always voluntary, adds an informant.[1] Philip forced compliance\r\nwith this new fashion upon all who seemed reluctant to be\r\nunnecessarily shorn of what beauty was theirs by nature's gift. This\r\nservility may have consoled Philip for the deprivation of his hair. In\r\nhis depressed condition any solace was acceptable.\r\n\r\nIt was just when the duke was in this enfeebled state that Louis,\r\nthrough the mediation of the Croys, pushed forward his proposition to\r\nredeem the towns and Philip agreed, possibly relying upon the chance\r\nthat it would be no easy matter for the French king to wring the\r\nrequired sum from his impoverished land. Philip's assent was, however,\r\npromptly clinched by a cash payment of half the amount[2]; the\r\nremainder followed.\r\n\r\nAmiens, Abbeville, and the other towns, valuable bulwarks for the\r\nNetherland provinces, fine nurseries for the human material requisite\r\nfor Burgundian armies, rich tax payers as they were, all tumbled into\r\nthe outstretched hands of the duke's wily rival.\r\n\r\nThe transaction was hurried through and completed before a rumour of\r\nits progress came to the ear of the interested heir. Charles was in\r\nHolland sulking and indignant. He had expected good results from his\r\ntender devotion during his father's acute illness, a devotion shared\r\nby Isabella of Portugal who hastened to her husband's bedside from her\r\nconvent seclusion when Philip was in need of her ministrations. But,\r\nin his convalescence, Philip renewed his friendship for the Croys\r\nwhom Charles continued to distrust with bitterness that varied in its\r\nintensity, but which never vanished from his consciousness. The young\r\nman felt misjudged, misused, and ever suspicious that personal danger\r\nto himself lurked in the air of his father's court.\r\n\r\nThe various rumours of plots against his life may not all have been\r\nbaseless. At last, one of own cousins, the Count of Nevers, was\r\naccused of having recourse to diabolic means of doing away with the\r\nduke's legitimate heir.[2] Three little waxen images were found in his\r\nhouse, and it was alleged that he practised various magic arts withal\r\nin order to win the favour of the duke and of the French king, and\r\nstill worse to cause Charles to waste away with a mysterious sickness.\r\nThe accusations were sufficient to make Nevers resign all his offices\r\nin his kinsman's court and retire, post-haste, to France. Had he been\r\nwholly innocent he would have demanded trial at the hands of his peers\r\nof the Golden Fleece as behooved one of the order. But he withdrew\r\nundefended, and left his tattered reputation fluttering raggedly in\r\nthe breeze of gossip.\r\n\r\nCharles stayed in Holland aloof from the ducal court until a fresh\r\nincident drove him thither to give vent to his indignation. Only three\r\ndays had Philip de Commines been page to Duke Philip, then resident at\r\nLille, when an embassy headed by Morvilliers, Chancellor of France,\r\nwas given audience in the presence of the Burgundian court, including\r\nthe Count of Charolais. The future historian,[4] then nineteen years\r\nold, was keenly alive to all that passed on that November fifth, 1464.\r\nMorvilliers used very bitter terms in his assertion that Charles had\r\nillegally stopped a little French ship of war and arrested a certain\r\nbastard of Rubempré on the false charge that his errand in Holland,\r\nwhere the incident occurred, was to seize and carry off Charles\r\nhimself. Moreover, one knight of Burgundy, Sir Olivier de La Marche\r\nhad caused this tale to be bruited everywhere,\r\n\r\n    \"especially at Bruges whither strangers of all nations resort.\r\n    This had hurt Louis deeply, and he now demanded through his\r\n    chancellor that Duke Philip should send this same Sir Olivier de\r\n    La Marche prisoner to Paris, there to be punished as the case\r\n    required. Whereupon, Duke Philip answered that the said Sir\r\n    Olivier was steward of his house, born in the County of Burgundy\r\n    and in no respect subject to the Crown of France.\"\r\n\r\nPhilip added that if his servant had wrought ill to the king's honour\r\nhe, the duke, would see to his punishment. As to the bastard of\r\nRubempré, true it was that he had been apprehended in Holland,[5] but\r\nthere was adequate ground for his arrest as his behaviour had been\r\nstrange, at least so thought the Count of Charolais. Philip added that\r\nif his son were suspicious\r\n\r\n    \"he took it not of him for he was never so, but of his mother\r\n    who had been the most jealous lady that ever lived. But\r\n    notwithstanding\" [quoth he] \"that myself never were supicious, yet\r\n    if I had been in my son's place at the same time that this bastard\r\n    of Rubempré haunted those coasts I would surely have caused him to\r\n    be apprehended as my son did.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Philip promised to deliver up Rubempré to the king were\r\nhis innocence satisfactorily proven.\r\n\r\nMorvilliers then resumed his discourse, enlarging upon the treacherous\r\ndesigns of Francis, Duke of Brittany, with whom Charles had lately\r\nsworn brotherhood at the very moment when he was the honoured guest\r\nof King Louis at Tours. During this discussion the Count of Charolais\r\nbecame very restive. Finally he could no longer endure Morvilliers's\r\nindirect slurs, and\r\n\r\n    \"made offer eftsoon to answer, being marvellously out of patience\r\n    to hear such reproachful speeches used of his friend and\r\n    confederate. But Morvilliers cut him off, saying: 'My Lord of\r\n    Charolais, I am not come of ambassage to you, but to my Lord your\r\n    father.' The said earl besought his father divers times to give\r\n    him leave to answer, who in the end said unto him: 'I have\r\n    answered for thee as methinketh the father should answer for the\r\n    son, notwithstanding if thou have so great desire to speak bethink\r\n    thyself to-day and to-morrow speak and spare not.'\"\r\n\r\nThen Morvilliers to his former speech added that he could not imagine\r\nwhat had moved the earl to enter into the league with the Duke of\r\nBrittany unless it were because of a pension the king had once given\r\nhim together with the government of Normandy and afterwards taken from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Rubempré, Commines adds to his story Charles's own\r\nstatement given on the morrow:\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding, I think nothing was ever proved against him, though\r\nI confess the presumption to have been great. Five years after I\r\nmyself saw him delivered out of prison.\" This from Commines. La Marche\r\nis less detailed in his record[6] of the Rubempré incident:\r\n\r\n    \"The bastard was put in prison and the Count of Charolais sent me\r\n    to Hesdin to the duke to inform him of the arrest and its cause.\r\n    The good duke heard my report kindly like a wise prince. In truth\r\n    he at once suspected that the craft of the King of France lurked\r\n    at the bottom of the affair. Shortly afterwards the duke left\r\n    Hesdin and returned to his own land, which did not please the King\r\n    of France who despatched thither a great embassy with the Count\r\n    d'Eu at the head. Demands were made that I should be delivered to\r\n    him to be punished as he would, because he claimed that I had been\r\n    the cause of the arrest of the bastard of Rubempré and also of the\r\n    duke's departure from Hesdin without saying adieu to the King of\r\n    France, but the good duke, moderate in all his actions, replied\r\n    that I was his subject and his servitor, and that if the king or\r\n    any one else had a grievance against me he would investigate it.\r\n    The matter was finally smoothed over [adds La Marche], and Louis\r\n    evinced a readiness to conciliate his offended cousin.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of La Marche, the matter proved to be one not easily disposed\r\nof by soft phrases flung into the breach. Charles obeyed his father\r\nand prepared in advance his defence to the chancellor. When he had\r\nfinished his own statement about Rubempré, he proceeded to the point\r\nof his friendship with the Duke of Brittany, declaring that it was\r\nright and proper and that if King Louis knew what was to the advantage\r\nof the French sovereign, he would be glad to see his nobles welded\r\ntogether as a bulwark to his throne. As to his pension, he had never\r\nreceived but one quarter, nine thousand francs. He had made no suit\r\nfor the remainder nor for the government of Normandy. So long as he\r\nenjoyed the favour and good will of his father he had no need to crave\r\nfavour of any man.\r\n\r\n\"I think verily had it not been for the reverence he bore to his said\r\nfather who was there present\" continues the observant page, \"and to\r\nwhom he addressed his speech that he would have used much bitterer\r\nterms. In the end, Duke Philip very wisely and humbly besought the\r\nking not lightly to conceive an evil opinion of him or his son but to\r\ncontinue his favour towards them. Then the banquet was brought in and\r\nthe ambassadors took their leave. As they passed out Charles stood\r\napart from his father and said to the archbishop of Narbonne, who\r\nbrought up the rear of the little company:\r\n\r\n\"'Recommend me very humbly to the good grace of the king. Tell him he\r\nhas had me scolded here by the chancellor but that he shall repent it\r\nbefore a year is past.'\" His message was duly delivered and to this\r\nincident Commines attributes momentous results.\r\n\r\nExasperated at the nonchalant manner in which Louis's ambassadors\r\ntreated him, indignant at the injury to his heritage by the redemption\r\nof the towns on the Somme, and further, already alienated from his\r\nroyal cousin through the long series of petty occasions where the\r\ndifferent natures of the two young men clashed, in this year 1464,\r\nCharles was certainly more than ready to enter into an open contest\r\nwith the French monarch. It was not long before the opportunity came\r\nfor him to do so with a certain éclat.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of his own freedom, before he learned wisdom, Louis\r\nXI. had planted many seeds of enmity which brought forth a plentiful\r\ncrop, and the fruit was an open conspiracy among the nobles of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of loosening feudal ties was the gradual growth of\r\nthe body of standing troops instituted in 1439 by Charles VII. These,\r\nin the regular pay of the crown, gave the king a guarantee of support\r\nwithout the aid of his nobles. By the date of Louis's accession,\r\ncertain ducal houses besides that of Burgundy had grown very\r\nindependent within their own boundaries: Orleans, Anjou, Bourbon, not\r\nto speak of Brittany.[7] Now the efforts to curtail the prerogatives\r\nof these petty sovereigns, begun by Charles VII., were steady and\r\npersistent in the new reign. They had no longer the power of coining\r\nmoney, of levying troops, or of imposing taxes, while the judicial\r\nauthority of the crown had been extended little by little over France.\r\nThen their privileges were further attacked by Louis's restrictions of\r\nthe chase.\r\n\r\nIt was the accumulation of these invasions of local authority, added\r\nto a real disbelief in the king's ability, that led to a formation of\r\na league among the nobles, designed to check the centralisation policy\r\nof the monarch, a League of Public Weal to form a bulwark against the\r\ntyrannical encroachments of their liege lord.\r\n\r\nNot to follow the steps of the growth of this coalition, it is\r\nsufficient for the thread of this narrative to say that it comprised\r\nall the great French nobles, the princes of the blood as well as\r\nothers. Men whom Louis had flattered as well as those whom he had\r\nslighted alike fell from his standards, distrustful of his ability to\r\nwithstand organised opposition, and they threw in their lot with the\r\nprotestors so as not to miss their share of the spoil.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Charolais, as already mentioned, was in a mood when\r\nhis ears were eagerly open to overtures from Louis's critics. The\r\nredemption of the towns on the Somme he was unable to prevent, but the\r\naffair left him very sore. Shortly after its completion, the count\r\ndid, indeed, succeed in depriving the Croys of their ascendency over\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy, but when that long desired victory was attained,\r\nthe towns had one and all accepted their transfer and were under\r\nFrench sovereignty. When the count joined the league, the hope of\r\nultimate restoration was undoubtedly prominent among the motives for\r\nhis own course of action, though his intimacy with the chief leader of\r\nthe revolt, the Duke of Brittany, might easily have led to the same\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nTowards Francis of Brittany, Louis XI. had been especially wanting in\r\ntact during the first months of his reign. The king treated him as a\r\nvassal of France, while the duke held that he and his forbears owed\r\nsimple homage to the crown, not dependence. Therefore, in order to\r\nresist being subordinated, the Duke of Brittany resolved not to leave\r\nhis estates except in a suitable manner. His messages to the king\r\nwere sent in all ceremony, he rendered proper homage, declared his\r\nreadiness to serve him as a kinsman and as a vassal for certain\r\nterritories, but demanded freedom to exercise his hereditary rights\r\nand to enjoy his hereditary dignities.[8]\r\n\r\n\"Rude and strange\" were the terms employed by the king in response to\r\nthese statements, and then he proceeded to encroach still farther on\r\nthe duke's seigniorial rights by attempts to dispose of the hands of\r\nBreton heiresses in unequal marriages, and to arrogate to himself\r\nother rights--all sufficient provocation to justify Francis of\r\nBrittany in becoming one of the chiefs in the league. Very delightful\r\nis Chastellain's colloquy with himself[9] as to the difficulty of\r\nmaintaining perfect impartiality in discussing the cause of this\r\nFranco-Burgundian war, but unfortunately the result of his patient\r\nefforts is lost.\r\n\r\nOlivier de La Marche and Philip de Commines, however, were both\r\npresent in the Burgundian army and their stories are preserved. La\r\nMarche had reason to remember the first actual engagement between the\r\nroyal and invading forces at Montl'héry, \"because on that day I was\r\nmade knight.\" He does not say, as does Commines, that this battle was\r\nagainst the king's desire. Louis had hoped to avoid any use of arms\r\nand to coerce his rebellious nobles into quiescence by other methods.\r\nNot that they characterised themselves as rebellious, far from it.\r\nClear and definite was their statement that in their obligation\r\n\r\n    \"to give order to the estate, the police and the government of the\r\n    kingdom, the princes of the blood as chief supports of the crown,\r\n    by whose advice and not by that of others, the business of the\r\n    king and of the state ought to be directed, are ready to risk\r\n    their persons and their property, and in this laudable endeavour\r\n    all virtuous citizens ought to aid.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThus wrote Charles to the citizens of Amiens, and the words were\r\ntypical of similar appeals made in every quarter of the realm by the\r\nvarious feudal chiefs to their respective subjects. In truth this war,\r\nostentatiously called that of the Public Weal, was but a struggle on\r\nthe part of the great nobles for local sovereignty. The weal demanded\r\nwas home rule for the feudal chiefs. The War of Public Weal was a\r\nfierce protest against monarchical authority, against concentration. A\r\nking indeed, but a king in leading strings was the ideal of the peers.\r\n\r\nThus matters stood in June, 1465. Louis almost alone, deserted by his\r\nbrother the Duke of Berry, and his nobles banded together in apparent\r\nunity, hedged in by their pompous and self-righteous assertions that\r\nall their thoughts were for the poor oppressed people whose burdens\r\nneeded lightening. Of all the great vassals, Gaston de Foix was the\r\nsingle one loyal to the king.\r\n\r\nThe part of the great duke fell entirely to the share of the Count of\r\nCharolais. A small force was levied for him within the Netherlands,\r\nand he started for Paris where he hoped to meet contingents from the\r\ntwo Burgundies and his brother peers of France with their own troops.\r\nHis men were good individually but they had not been trained to act as\r\none, and there was no coherence between the different companies.\r\n\r\nJuly, 1465, found Charles at St. Denis, the appointed rendezvous. He\r\nwas first in the field. While he awaited his allies, his little army\r\nbecame restive at the situation in which they found themselves, fifty\r\nleagues from Burgundian territory with no stronghold as their base. It\r\nwas urged again and again upon the count that his first consideration\r\nought to be his men's safety. His allies had failed him. He should\r\nretreat. \"I have crossed the Oise and the Marne and I will cross the\r\nSeine if I have but a single page to follow me,\" was the leader's firm\r\nreply to these demands.\r\n\r\nThe leaguers were slow to keep their pledges, and Charles decided that\r\nit was his mission to prevent Louis from entering his capital, to\r\nwhich he was advancing with great rapidity from the south. To carry\r\nout this purpose Charles disregarded all protests, crossed the Seine\r\nat St. Cloud, and made his way to the little village of Longjumeau,\r\nwhither he was preceded by the Count of St. Pol, commanding one\r\ndivision of the Burgundian army. Montl'héry was a village still\r\nfarther to the south, and here it was that La Marche and other\r\ngentlemen were knighted. This ceremony was evidently part of the\r\ncount's endeavour to encourage his followers--all unwilling to risk an\r\nengagement before the arrival of the allies.\r\n\r\nTo the king it was of infinite advantage that no delay should occur.\r\nNevertheless, it was Charles who opened active hostilities on July\r\n15th, with soldiers who had not broken their fast that day. Armed\r\nsince early dawn, wearied by a forced march with a July sun beating\r\ndown upon their heads, their movements hampered by standing wheat and\r\nrye, the men were at a tremendous disadvantage when they were led to\r\nthe attack. It was a hot assault. No quarter was given, many fled.\r\nAt length, Louis found himself abandoned by all save his body-guard.\r\nPressed against the hill that bounded the grain fields, the king at\r\nlast retreated up its slope into a castle on its summit.\r\n\r\nCharles rode impetuously after the retreating royalists. Separated\r\nfrom his men, he fell among the royal guard at the gate of the castle.\r\nThere was a vehement assault resisted as vehemently by his meagre\r\nescort. Several fell and Charles himself received a sword wound on his\r\nneck where his armour had slipped. Recognised by the French, he might\r\nhave been taken or slain in his resistance, when the Bastard of\r\nBurgundy rode in and rescued him. Very desperate seemed the count's\r\ncondition. When night fell, no one knew where lay the advantage. The\r\nfugitives spread rumours that the king was dead and that Charles was\r\nin possession, others carried the reverse statements as they rode\r\nheadlong to the nearest safety. It was a rout on both sides with no\r\ncredit to either leader. But in the darkness of the night, the king\r\nmanaged to slip out of his retreat and march quietly towards the\r\ngreater security of Paris.\r\n\r\nIt was a very shadowy victory that Charles proudly claimed. All\r\nthrough the night of July 15th, the Burgundians were discussing\r\nwhether to flee or to risk further fighting against the odds all\r\nrecognised. Daybreak found the council in session when a peasant\r\nbrought tidings that the foe had departed. The fires in sight only\r\ncovered their retreat. To be sure that same foe had taken Burgundian\r\nbaggage with them to Paris. But what of that? The Burgundians held the\r\nbattlefield and they made the best of it.\r\n\r\nOn July 16th, Louis supped with the military governor of Paris and\r\n\"moved the company, nobles and ladies, to sympathetic tears by his\r\ntouching description of the perils he had met and escaped.\" Charles,\r\nmeanwhile, effected a junction with his belated allies, Francis of\r\nBrittany and Charles of France, the Duke of Berry, at Étampes. Thither\r\ntoo, came the dukes of Bourbon and of Lorraine, but none of these\r\nleaguers could claim any share in the battle of Montl'héry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF MONTL'HÉRY, JULY 16, 1465 (COMINES, ED.\r\nLENGLET DU FRESNOY, 1.)]\r\n\r\nWhile these peers perfected their plans to force their chief into\r\nredressing the wrongs of the poor people, the king was showing a very\r\npleasant side of his character to the Parisian citizens. In response\r\nto a petition that he should take advice on the conduct of his\r\nadministration, he declared his perfect willingness to add to his\r\ncouncil six burgesses, six members of _parlement_, and the same number\r\nfrom the university. Besides this concession, he relieved the weight\r\nof the imposts and hastened to restore certain financial franchises to\r\nthe Church, to the university, and to various individuals. Three weeks\r\nwere consumed in establishing friendly relations in this all important\r\ncity, and then the king departed for Normandy to levy troops and to\r\ncollect provisions for a siege.[11] There was need for this last for\r\nthe allies had moved up to the immediate vicinity of Paris.\r\n\r\nBefore the king's return to his capital on August 28th, a formidable\r\narray was encamped at Charenton and its neighbourhood. More\r\nformidable, however, they were in numbers than in strength. Like all\r\nconfederated bodies there was inherent weakness, for there was no\r\nleader whom all would be willing to obey. The Duke of Berry, heir\r\npresumptive to the throne, was the only one among the peers whose\r\nbirth might have commanded the needful authority, but he had not\r\nsufficient personal character to assert his position. So the\r\nconfederates remained a loose aggregation of small armies. The longer\r\nthey remained in camp the weaker they grew, the more disintegrated.\r\nA pitched battle might have been a great advantage to these gallant\r\ndefenders of the Public Weal of France and that was the last desire of\r\ntheir antagonist.\r\n\r\nMany skirmishes took place between the Parisians and the leaguers, but\r\nno engagement. Once, indeed, there were hurried preparations on the\r\npart of the Burgundians to repulse an attack, of whose imminence they\r\nwere warned by a page before break of day, one misty morning. Yes,\r\nthere was no doubt. The pickets could see the erect spears and furled\r\nbanners of the enemy all ready to advance upon the unwary camp. Quick\r\nwere the preparations. There were no laggards. The Duke of Calabria\r\nwas more quickly armed than even the Count of Charolais. He came to a\r\nspot where a number of Burgundians, the count's own household stood,\r\nby the standard. Among them was Commines[l2] and he heard the duke\r\nsay: \"We now have our desire, for the king is issued forth with his\r\nwhole force and marches towards us as our scouts report. Wherefore let\r\nus determine to play the men. So soon as they be out of the town we\r\nwill enter and measure with the long ell.\" By these words he meant\r\nthat the soldiers would speedily have a chance to use their pikes as\r\nyard sticks to measure out their share of the booty. False prophet\r\nwas the duke that time! When the daylight grew stronger, the upright\r\nspears and furled banners of the advancing foe proved to be a mass of\r\nthistles looming large in the magnifying morning mist! The princes\r\ntook their disappointment philosophically, enjoyed early mass, and\r\nthen had their breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe young Commines is surprised that Paris and her environs were rich\r\nenough to feed so many men. Gradually the aspect of affairs changed.\r\nNegotiating back and forth became more frequent. The disintegration of\r\nthe allies became more and more evident. Louis XI. bided his time and\r\nthen took the extraordinary resolution to go in person to the camp at\r\nCharenton to visit his cousin of Burgundy. With a very few attendants,\r\npractically unguarded, he went down the Seine. His coming had been\r\nheralded and the Count of Charolais stood ready to receive him, with\r\nthe Count of St. Pol at his side. \"Brother, do you pledge me safety?\"\r\n(for the count's first wife was sister of Louis) to which the count\r\nresponded: \"Yes, as one brother to another.\"[13]\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more genial than was the king. He assured\r\nCharles that he loved a man who kept his word beyond anything.\r\n\r\nVeracity was his passion. Charles had kept the promise he had sent by\r\nthe archbishop of Narbonne, and now he knew in very truth that he was\r\na gentleman and true to the blood of France. Further, he disavowed the\r\ninsolence of his chancellor towards Charles, and repeated that his\r\ncousin had been justified in resenting it. \"You have kept your promise\r\nand that long before the day.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThen in a friendly promenade, Louis gave an opportunity to Charles and\r\nSt. Pol to state, informally, the terms on which they would withdraw\r\nfrom their hostile footing, and count the weal restored to the\r\noppressed public whose sorrows had moved them to a confederation.\r\n\r\nDistasteful as was every item to Louis, he accepted the requisition of\r\nthose who felt that they were in a position to dictate, and after a\r\nlittle more parleying at later dates, the treaty of Conflans was duly\r\narranged. It was none too soon for the allies. They could hardly have\r\nheld together many days longer in the midst of the jealousies rife in\r\ntheir camps.\r\n\r\nThe king paused at nothing. To his brother he gave Normandy, to\r\nCharles of Burgundy the towns on the Somme with guarantee of\r\npossession for his lifetime, while the Count of St. Pol was made\r\nConstable of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS XI. WITH THE PRINCES AND SEIGNEURS OF THE WAR\r\nOF PUBLIC WEAL TAKEN FROM CONTEMPORANEOUS MINIATURE IN ABBEY OF ST.\r\nGERMAIN DES PRÉS (COMINES-LENGLET, II., FRONTISPIECE)]\r\n\r\nBoulogne and Guienne, too, were ceded to Charles, lesser places and\r\npensions to the other confederates. The contest ended with complete\r\nvictory for the allies who were left with the proud consciousness\r\nthat they had set a definite limit to royal pretensions, at least, on\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty was signed, the king showed no resentment at his\r\ndefeat but urged his cousin to amuse himself a while in Paris before\r\nreturning home. Charles was rash, but he had not the temerity to trust\r\nhimself so far. Pleading a promise to his father to enter no city gate\r\nuntil on paternal soil, he declined the invitation and soon returned\r\nto the Netherlands, where his own household had suffered change.\r\nDuring his absence, the Countess of Charolais had died and been buried\r\nat Antwerp. Charles is repeatedly lauded for his perfect faithfulness\r\nto his wife, but her death seems to have made singularly little ripple\r\non the surface of his life. The chroniclers touch on the event very\r\ncasually, laying more stress on the opportunity it gave Louis XI.\r\nto offer his daughter Anne as her successor, than on the event\r\nitself.[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: La Marche, ii., 227.

To another city he now turned his attention, to Liege\r\nwhich owed nothing whatsoever to Burgundy.\r\n\r\nBefore the days when the buried treasures of the soil filled the\r\nair with smoke, the valley where Liege lies was a lovely spot.[2]\r\nTradition tells how, in the sixth century, Monulphe, Bishop of\r\nTongres, as he made a progress through his diocese was attracted by\r\nthe beauties of the site where a few hovels then clustered near the\r\nMeuse. After looking down from the heights to the river's banks for\r\na brief space, the bishop turned to his followers and said, as if\r\nuttering a prophecy:\r\n\r\n\"Here is a place created by God for the salvation of many faithful\r\nsouls. One day a prosperous city shall flourish here. Here I will\r\nbuild a chapel.\" Dedicated to Cosmo and Damian, the promised chapel\r\nbecame a shrine which attracted many pilgrims who returned to their\r\nvarious homes with glowing tales of the beautiful and fertile valley.\r\nLittle by little others came who did not leave, and by the seventh\r\ncentury when Bishop Lambert sat in the see of Tongres, Liege was a\r\nsmall town.\r\n\r\nAn active and loving shepherd was this Lambert. He gave himself no\r\nrest but travelled continually from one church to another in his\r\ndiocese to look after the needs of his flock. He was a fearless\r\nprelate, too, and his words of well-deserved rebuke to the Frankish\r\nPepin for a lawless deed excited the wrath of a certain noble,\r\naccessory to the act. Trouble ensued and Lambert was slain as he knelt\r\nbefore the altar in Monulphe's chapel at Liege. Absorbed in prayer\r\nthe pious man did not hear the servants' calls, \"Holy Lambert, Holy\r\nLambert come to our aid,\" words that later became a war-cry when the\r\nbishop was exalted into the patron saint of the town.\r\n\r\nNot until the thirteenth century, however, when the episcopal see was\r\nfinally established at Liege, was Lambert's successor virtual lay\r\noverlord of the region as well as Bishop of Liege. Monulphe's little\r\nchapel had given way to a mighty church dedicated to the canonised\r\nBishop Lambert. The ecclesiastical state became almost autonomous, the\r\nepiscopal authority being restricted without the walls only by the\r\ndistant emperor and still more distant pope. Within the walls, the\r\nsame authority had by no means a perfectly free hand. There were\r\ncertain features in the constitution of Liege which differentiated it\r\nfrom its sister towns in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nMunicipal affairs were conducted in a singularly democratic manner.\r\nThere was no distinction between the greater and lesser gilds, and,\r\nwithin these organisations, the franchise was given to the most\r\nignorant apprentice had he only fulfilled the simple condition of\r\nattaining his fifteenth year. Moreover, the naturalisation laws were\r\nvery easy. Newcomers were speedily transformed into citizens and\r\nenjoyed eligibility to office as well as the franchise. The tenure of\r\noffice being for one year only, there was opportunity for frequent\r\nparticipation in public affairs, an opportunity not neglected by the\r\ncommunity.[2]\r\n\r\nThe bishop was, of course, not one of the civic officers chosen by\r\nthis liberal franchise. He was elected by the chapter of St. Lambert,\r\nsubject to papal and imperial ratification for the two spheres of his\r\njurisdiction. But in the exercise of his function there were many\r\nrestrictions to his free administration, which papal and imperial\r\nsanction together were unable to remove.\r\n\r\nA bishop-prince of Liege could make no change in the laws without the\r\nconsent of the estates, and he could administer justice only by means\r\nof the regular tribunals. Every edict had to be countersigned. When\r\nthere was an issue between overlord and people, the question was\r\nsubmitted to the _schepens_ or superior judges who, before they gave\r\ntheir opinion, consulted the various charters which had been granted\r\nfrom time to time, and which were not allowed to become dead letters.\r\nA permanent committee of the three orders supervised the executive and\r\nthe administration of the laws. These \"twenty-two\" received an appeal\r\nfrom the meanest citizen, and the Liege proverb \"In his own home the\r\npoor man is king,\" was very near the possible truth.\r\n\r\nYet the wheels of government were by no means perfect in their\r\nrunning. Many were the conflicts between the different members of the\r\nstate, and broils, with the character of civil war in miniature, were\r\nof frequent occurrence. The submergence of the aristocratic element,\r\nthe nobles, destroyed a natural balance of power between the\r\nbishop-prince and the people. The commons exerted power beyond their\r\nintelligence. Annual elections, party contests headed by rival\r\ndemagogues kept the capital, and, to a lesser extent, the smaller\r\ntowns of the little state in continuous commotion[4].\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical origin of the community was evident at all points\r\nof daily life. The cathedral of St. Lambert was the pride of the city.\r\nIts chapter, consisting of sixty canons, took the place held by the\r\naristocratic element in the other towns.\r\n\r\nIn the cathedral, the holy standard of St. Lambert was suspended. At\r\nthe outbreak of war this was taken down and carried to the door by the\r\nclergy in solemn procession. There it was unfurled and delivered to\r\nthe commander of the civic militia mounted on a snow-white steed. When\r\nhe received the precious charge he swore to defend it with his life.\r\n\r\nOne object of popular veneration was this standard, another was the\r\n_perron_, an emblem of the civic organisation. This was a pillar of\r\ngilded bronze, its top representing a pineapple surmounted by a cross.\r\nThis stood on a pedestal in the centre of the square where was the\r\n_violet_ or city hall. In front of the perron were proclaimed all the\r\nordinances issued by the magistrates, or the decrees adopted by the\r\npeople in general assembly. On these occasions the tocsin was rung,\r\nthe deans of the gilds would hasten out with their banners and plant\r\nthem near the perron as rallying points for the various gild members\r\nwho poured out from forge, work-shop, and factory until the square was\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nThere were two powerful weapons whereby the bishop-prince might\r\nenforce his will in opposition to that of his subjects did the latter\r\nbecome too obstreperous. He could suspend the court of the _schepens_,\r\nand he could pronounce an interdict of the Church which caused the\r\ncessation of all priestly functions. When this interdict was in\r\naction, civil suits between burghers could be adjudged by the\r\nmunicipal magistrates, but no criminals could be arrested or tried.\r\nThe elementary principles of an organised society were thrown into\r\nconfusion. Still worse confusion resulted from the bishop's last\r\nresort as prince of the Church. An interdict caused the church bells\r\nto be silent, the church doors to be closed. The celebration of the\r\nrites of baptism, of marriage, of burial ceased.[5] The fear of such\r\ncessation was potent in its restraint, unless the populace were too\r\nfar enraged to be moved by any consideration.\r\n\r\nWhile the Burgundian dukes extended their sway over one portion of\r\nNetherland territory after another, this little dominion maintained\r\nits complete independence of them. The fact that its princes were\r\nelective protected it from lapsing through heritage to the duke who\r\nhad been so neatly proven heir to his divers childless kinsfolk. It\r\nwas a rich little vineyard without his pale.\r\n\r\nThey were clever people those Liegeois. Their Walloon language is\r\na species of French with many peculiarities showing Frankish\r\nadmixture.[6] The race was probably a mixed one too, but its acquired\r\ncharacteristics made a very different person from a Hollander, a\r\nFrisian, or a Fleming, though there was a certain resemblance to the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIn 1465, not yet exploited were the wonderful resources of coal and\r\nminerals which now glow above and below the furnace fires until, from\r\na distance, Liege looks like a very Inferno. But the people were\r\nindustrious and energetic in their crafts. It was a country of skilled\r\nworkmen. The city of Liege is accredited with one hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants at this epoch, and the numbers reported slain in\r\nthe various battles in which the town was involved run into the\r\nthousands.[7]\r\n\r\nIn 1456, Philip of Burgundy, encouraged by his success in the diocese\r\nof Utrecht, obtained a certain ascendency over the affairs of Liege by\r\ninterfering in the election of a bishop. There was no natural vacancy\r\nat the moment. John of Heinsberg was the incumbent, a very pleasant\r\nprelate with conciliatory ways. He loved amusement and gay society,\r\npleasures more easily obtainable in Philip's court than in his own,\r\nand his agreeable host found means of persuading him to resign all the\r\ncares of his see. Then the enterprising duke proceeded to place his\r\nown nephew, Louis of Bourbon, upon the vacant episcopal throne.\r\n\r\nThis nephew was an eighteen-year-old student at the University of\r\nLouvain, destitute of a single qualification for the office proposed.\r\nNevertheless, all difficulties, technical and general were ignored,\r\nand a papal dispensation enabled the candidate even to dispense with\r\nthe formality of taking orders. Attired in scarlet with a feathered\r\nBurgundian cap on his head, Louis made his entry into his future\r\ncapital and was duly enthroned as bishop-prince in spite of his\r\nmanifest unfitness for the place.\r\n\r\nNor did he prove a pleasant surprise to his people, better than the\r\npromise of his youth, as some reckless princes have done. On the\r\ncontrary, ignorant, sensuous, extortionate, he was soon at drawn\r\nswords with his subjects. After a time he withdrew to Huy where he\r\nindulged in gross pleasures while he attempted to check the rebellious\r\ncitizens of his capital by trying some of the measures of coercion\r\nused by his predecessors as a last resort.\r\n\r\nLiege was lashed into a state of fury. Matters dragged on for a long\r\ntime. The people appealed to Cologne, to the papal legate, to the\r\npope, and to the \"pope better informed,\" but no redress was given.\r\nPhilip continued to protect the bishop, and none dared put themselves\r\nin opposition to him. Finally, the people turned to Louis XI. for aid.\r\nTheir appeal was heard and the king's agent arrived in the city\r\njust as one of the bishop's interdicts was about to be enforced,\r\nan interdict, too, endorsed by a papal bull, threatening the usual\r\nanathema if the provisions were not obeyed.\r\n\r\nIt was the moment for a demagogue and one appeared in the person of\r\nRaes de la Rivière, lord of Heers. On July 5, 1465, there was to be\r\nunbroken silence in all sacred edifices. Heers and his followers\r\nproclaimed that every priest who refused to chant should be thrown\r\ninto the river. Mass was said under those unpeaceful and unspiritual\r\nconditions, and the presence of the French envoys gave new heart to\r\nthe bishop's opponents. A treaty was signed between the Liegeois\r\nand Louis; wherein mutual pledges were made that no peace should be\r\nconcluded with Burgundy in which both parties were not included. It\r\nwas a solemn pledge but it did not hamper Louis when he signed the\r\ntreaty of Conflans whose articles contained not a single reference to\r\nthe Liegeois.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it chanced that the first report of the battle of\r\nMontl'héry reaching Liege gave the victory to Louis, a report that\r\nspurred on the Liegeois to carry their acts of open hostility to their\r\nneighbour, still farther afield. The other towns of the Church state\r\nwere infected by an anti-Burgundian sentiment. In Dinant this feeling\r\nwas high, and there was, moreover, a manifestation of special\r\nanimosity against the Count of Charolais. A rabble marched out of the\r\ncity to the walls of Bouvignes, a town of Namur, loyal to Burgundy,\r\ncarrying a stuffed figure with a cow-bell round its neck. Certain\r\nwell-known emblems of Burgundy on a tattered mantle showed that this\r\nrepresented Charles of Burgundy. With rude words the crowd declared\r\nthat they were going to hang the effigy as his master, the King of\r\nFrance, had already hanged Count Charles in reality. Further, they\r\nsaid that he was no count at all, but the son of their old bishop,\r\nHeinsberg. They went so far as to suspend the effigy on a gallows and\r\nthen riddled it with arrows and left it dangling like a scarecrow in\r\nsight of the citizens of Bouvignes.[8]\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the treaty made at Conflans did not reach Liege\r\nuntil messages from Louis had assured them that he had been mindful of\r\ntheir interests in making his own terms, assurances, however, coupled\r\nwith advice to make peace with their good friend the duke. But there\r\nspeedily came later information that the only mention of Liege in the\r\nnew treaty was an apology that Louis had ever made friends in that\r\ncity!\r\n\r\nThe rebels lost heart at once. Without the king, they had no\r\nconfidence in their own efforts. Envoys were despatched to Philip who\r\nrefused to answer their humble requests for pardon until his son could\r\ndecide what punishment the principality deserved. Nor was much delay\r\nto be anticipated before an answer would be forthcoming. Charles\r\nhastened to Liege direct from Paris, not pausing even to greet his\r\nfather. By the third week of January, he was encamped between St.\r\nTrond and Tongres, where a fresh deputation from Liege found him.\r\nThese envoys, between eighty and a hundred, were well armed chiefly\r\nbecause they feared attacks from their anti-peace fellow-citizens.[9]\r\n\r\nThey found Charles flushed by his recent achievement of bringing King\r\nLouis to his way of thinking. His army, too, was a stronger body than\r\nwhen it left the Netherlands. The troops were more skilled from\r\ntheir experience and elated at what they counted their success; more\r\ncapable, too, of acting as one body under the guidance of a resolute\r\nleader, now inclined to despise councils with free discussion. The\r\ncount's quick temper had gained him weight but it had made him feared.\r\nThe slightest breach of discipline brought a thunder-cloud on his\r\nface. If we may believe one authority,[10] he himself was often so\r\nlacking in discipline that he would strike an officer with a baton,\r\nand once at least, he killed a soldier with his own hand.\r\n\r\nHis audience with the envoys resulted in a treaty, of which certain\r\narticles were so harsh that the messengers were insulted when the\r\nreport was made in Liege. Only eleven out of thirty-two gilds voted to\r\naccept all the articles. A certain noble on pleasant terms with the\r\ncount offered to carry the unpopular document back to him to ask for a\r\nmodification of the harsh terms.\r\n\r\nBy this time the weather was severe. Charles's troops were in need of\r\nrepose, and it seemed prudent to avoid hostility if possible. Charles\r\nrevoked the objectionable clauses in consideration of an increase of\r\nthe war indemnity. With this change the treaty was accepted, and a\r\nPiteous Peace it was indeed for the proud folk of Liege. Instead\r\nof owing allegiance to emperor and to pope alone as free imperial\r\ncitizens, they agreed to recognise the Burgundian dukes as hereditary\r\nprotectors of Liege.\r\n\r\nWhen it was desired, Burgundian troops could march freely across the\r\nterritory. Burgundian coins were declared valid at Burgundian values.\r\nNo Liege fortresses were to menace Burgundian marches, and unqualified\r\nobedience was pledged to the new overlords. The same terms were\r\nconceded to all the rebel towns alike except to Dinant. The story of\r\nthe personal insult to himself and his mother had reached the count's\r\nears and he was not inclined to ignore the circumstance. His further\r\naction was, however, deferred.\r\n\r\nJanuary 24, 1466, is the final date of the treaty[11] and, after its\r\nconclusion, Charles ordered a review of his forces, a review that\r\nalmost culminated in a pitched battle between army and citizens of St.\r\nTrond, and then on January 31st, the count returned to Brussels where\r\nthere was a great display of Burgundian etiquette before the duke\r\nembraced his victorious son.\r\n\r\nPiteous as was the peace for Liege and the province at large, still\r\nmore piteous was the lot of Dinant which alone was excluded from the\r\nparticipation in the treaty. Her fate remained uncertain for months.\r\nOther affairs occupied the Count of Charolais until late in the summer\r\nof 1466. Time had quickly proven that Louis, well freed from the\r\nallies pressing up to the gates of Paris, was in very different temper\r\nfrom Louis ill at ease under their strenuous demands. Not only had\r\nhe withdrawn his promises in regard to the duchy conferred on his\r\nbrother, but he had begun taking other measures, ostensibly to prepare\r\nagainst a possible English invasion, which alarmed his cousin of\r\nBurgundy for the undisturbed possession of his recently recovered\r\ntowns on the Somme.\r\n\r\nExcited by the rumours of Louis's purposes, Charles despatched the\r\nfollowing letter from Namur:[12]\r\n\r\n    \"MONSEIGNEUR:\r\n\r\n    \"I recommend myself very humbly to your good grace and beg to\r\n    inform you, Monseigneur, that recently I have been advised of\r\n    something very surprising to me, Moreover, I am now put beyond\r\n    doubt considering the source of my information. It is with much\r\n    regret that I communicate it to you when I remember all the good\r\n    words you have given to me this year, orally and in writing.\r\n    Monseigneur, it is evident that there has been some agreement\r\n    between your people and the English, and that the matter has been\r\n    so well worked that you have consented, as I have heard, to yield\r\n    them the land of Caux, Rouen, and the connecting villages, and to\r\n    aid them in withholding Abbeville and the county of Ponthieu, and\r\n    further, to cement with them certain alliances against me and my\r\n    country in making them large offers greatly to my prejudice and,\r\n    in order to complete the whole, they are to come to Dieppe.\r\n\r\n    \"Monseigneur, you may dispose of your own as you wish: but,\r\n    Monseigneur, in regard to what concerns me, it seems to me that\r\n    you would do better to leave my property in my hand than to be the\r\n    instrument of putting it into the hands of the English or of any\r\n    foreign nation. For this reason I entreat you, Monseigneur, that\r\n    if such overtures or greater ones have been opened by your people\r\n    that you will not commit yourself to them in any manner but will\r\n    insist on their cessation, and that you will do this in a way that\r\n    I may always have cause to remain your very humble servant as I\r\n    desire to do with all my heart. Above all, write to me your good\r\n    pleasure, and I implore you, Monseigneur, if there be any service\r\n    that I can render you, I am the one who would wish to employ all\r\n    that God has given me [to do it]. Written at Namur, August 16th.\r\n\r\n    \"Your very humble and obedient subject,\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES.\"\r\n\r\nThen the count proceeded to Dinant to inflict the punishment that the\r\nculprits had, to his mind, too long escaped.\r\n\r\nCommines calls this a strong and rich town, superior even to\r\nLiege.[13] A comparison of the two sites shows, however, that this\r\nstatement could hardly have been true at any time. Dinant lies in a\r\nnarrow space between the Meuse and high land. A lofty rock at one\r\nend of the town dominating the river is crowned by a fortress most\r\npicturesque in appearance. It is difficult to estimate how many\r\ninhabitants there actually were in the place in 1466, but there is\r\nno doubt as to their energy and character. As mentioned before, the\r\nartisans had acquired a high degree of skill in their specialty, and\r\ntheir brass work was renowned far and wide. Pots and pans and other\r\nutensils were known as _Dinanderies_.\r\n\r\nThe traffic in them was so important that Dinant had had her own\r\ncommercial relations with England for a long period. Her merchants\r\nenjoyed the same privileges in London as the members of the Hanseatic\r\nLeague, and an English company was held in high respect at Dinant.[14]\r\nThe brass-founders' gild ranked at Dinant as the drapers at Louvain,\r\nand the weavers at Ghent. As a \"great gild they formed a middle class\r\nbetween the lower gilds and the _bourgeois_,\" the merchants and richer\r\nfolk.[15] In municipal matters each of these three classes had a\r\nseparate vote.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Dinant had not been very ready to open hostilities\r\nagainst the House of Burgundy though she was equally critical of Louis\r\nof Bourbon in his episcopal misrule. It was undoubtedly her rivalry\r\nwith Bouvignes of Namur that brought her into the strife. That\r\nneighbour had taunted her rival to exasperation, and the fact that\r\nit was safe under the Duke of Burgundy and backed by him as Count of\r\nNamur, had brought a Burgundian element into the local contest.\r\n\r\nThe incidents of the insult to Charles and the aspersion on his\r\nmother's reputation undoubtedly were due to an irresponsible rabble\r\nrather than to any action that could properly be attributed to the\r\nleading men. Further, it really seems probable that the weight\r\nattached to the insulting act never occurred to the respectable\r\nburghers until they heard of it from others, so insignificant were the\r\nparticipants in it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was realised that serious consequences might result\r\nfrom reckless folly, the authorities were quite ready to separate\r\nthemselves from the event, and to arrest the culprits as common\r\nmalefactors. Once, indeed, the prisoners were temporarily rescued by\r\ntheir friends, and it seemed to Burgundian sympathisers a suspicious\r\ncircumstance that this happened just at a moment when there was\r\nrenewed hope for help from Louis XI. When convinced that such hopes\r\nwere vain, the magistrates became seriously alarmed and ready to go\r\nto any lengths to avert Burgundian vengeance. Finally the following\r\nletter was despatched to the Duke of Burgundy:[16]\r\n\r\n    \"The poor, humble and obedient servants and subjects of the most\r\n    reverend father in God, Louis of Bourbon, Bishop of Liege; and\r\n    your petty neighbours and borderers, the burgomaster's council and\r\n    folk of Dinant, humbly declare that it has come to their knowledge\r\n    that the wrath of your grace has been aroused against the town on\r\n    account of certain ill words spoken by some of the inhabitants\r\n    thereof, in contempt of your honourable person. The city is as\r\n    displeased about these words as it is possible to be, and far from\r\n    wishing to excuse the culprits has arrested as many as could be\r\n    found and now holds them in durance awaiting any punishment your\r\n    _grace_ may decree. As heartily and as lovingly as possible do\r\n    your petitioners beseech your grace to permit your anger to be\r\n    appeased, holding the people of Dinant exonerated, and resting\r\n    satisfied with the punishment of the guilty, inasmuch as the\r\n    people are bitterly grieved on account of the insults and have, as\r\n    before stated, arrested the culprits.\"\r\n\r\nWith further apologies for any failure of duty towards the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, the petitioners humbly begged to be granted the same terms\r\nthat Liege and the other towns had received. March 31st is the date\r\nof this humble document. Months of doubt followed before the terrible\r\nexperience of August proved the futility of their pleas, to which the\r\nducal family refused to listen, so deep was their sense of personal\r\naggrievement. Long as it was since the duchess had taken part in\r\npublic affairs, she, too, had a word to say here. And she, too, was\r\nimplacable against the town where any citizen had dared accuse her of\r\ninfidelity to her husband and to the Church whose interests were more\r\nto her than anything in the world except her son.[17]\r\n\r\nThe petition was as unheeded as were all the representations of the\r\nwould-be mediators. Again Dinant turned in desperation to Louis XI.\r\nand with assurances that after God his royal majesty was their only\r\nhope, besought him from mere charity and pity to persuade his cousin\r\nof Burgundy to forgive them. Apparently Louis took no notice of this\r\nappeal. Dinant's last hope was that her fellow-communes of Liege would\r\nrefuse to ratify the treaty unless she, too, were included. The sole\r\nconcession, obtained by their envoys to Charles in the winter, had\r\nbeen a short truce afterwards extended to May, 1466.\r\n\r\nDuring that summer the critical position of the little town was well\r\nknown. Some sympathisers offered aid but it was aid that there was\r\npossible danger in accepting. Many of the outlaws from Liege, who had\r\nbeen expressly excluded from the terms of the peace, had joined the\r\nranks of a certain free lance company called \"The Companions of the\r\nGreen Tent,\" as their only shelter was the interlaced branches of the\r\nforest. To Dinant came this band to aid in her defence.[18] At one\r\ntime it seemed as though a peaceful accommodation might be reached but\r\nit fell through. Not yet were the citizens ready to surrender their\r\ncharters--\"Franchises,--to the rescue,\" was a frequent cry and no\r\ntreaty was made.\r\n\r\nPhilip, long inactive, resolved to assist at the reduction of this\r\nplace in person. Too feeble to ride, he was carried to the Meuse in a\r\nlitter, and arrived at Namur on August 14th. Then attended by a small\r\nescort only, he proceeded to Bouvignes, a splendid vantage point\r\nwhence he could command a view of the scene of his son's intended\r\noperations. As the crisis became imminent there were a few further\r\nefforts to effect a reconciliation. When these failed, the town\r\nprepared to meet the worst.[19] Stories gravely related by Du\r\nClercq[20] represent the people of Dinant goaded to actual fury of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nBy August 7th, the Burgundian troops made their appearance, winding\r\ndown to the river. Conspicuous among the standards--and nobles from\r\nall Philip's dominions were in evidence--was the banner of the Count\r\nof Charolais, displaying St. George slaying the dragon.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, August 19th, Dinant was invested and the siege began.\r\nWithin the walls the most turbulent element had gained complete\r\ncontrol of affairs. All thought of prudence was thrown to the winds.\r\nFrom the walls they hurled words at the foe:\r\n\r\n\"Is your old doll of a duke tired of life that you have brought him\r\nhere to perish?[21] Your Count Charlotel is a green sprout. Bid him\r\ngo fight the King of France at Montl'hêry. If he waits for the noble\r\nLouis or the Liegeois he will have to take to his heels,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt was a heavy siege and the town was riddled with cannon-balls but\r\nthere was no assault. By the sixth day the magistrates determined\r\nto send their keys to the Count of Charolais and beg for mercy. The\r\ncaptain of the great gild of coppersmiths, Jean de Guérin, tried to\r\nencourage the faint-hearted to protest openly against this procedure.\r\nSeizing the city colours he declared: \"I will trust to no humane\r\nsentiment. I am ready to carry this flag to the breach and to live or\r\ndie with you. If you surrender, I will quit the town before the foe\r\nenter it.\" It was too late, the capitulation was made.\r\n\r\nWhen the keys were brought to Charles he remembered that he was not\r\nyet duke and ordered them presented to his father in his stead, and to\r\nhis half-brother Anthony was entrusted the task of formally accepting\r\nthe surrender.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening when the Bastard of Burgundy marched in. At\r\nfirst he held the incoming troops well under control, but the stores\r\nof wine were easy to reach, and by the morning there were wild scenes\r\nof disorder. When Charles arrived, however, on the morrow, Tuesday,\r\njust a week after the beginning of the siege, lawlessness was checked\r\nwith a strong hand. Any ill treatment of women was peculiarly\r\nrepugnant to him, and he did not hesitate to execute the sternest\r\njustice upon offenders.[22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTHONY OF BURGUNDY AFTER HANS MEMLING. DRESDEN\r\nGALLERY]\r\n\r\nHis entry into the fallen town was made with all the wonted Burgundian\r\npomp. Nothing in the proceedings occurred in a headlong or passionate\r\nmanner. A council of war was held and the proceedings decided upon.\r\nThe cruelty that was exercised was used in deliberate punishment,\r\nnot in savage lawlessness. The personal insults to his mother and to\r\nhimself rankled in the count's mind. As one author remarks[23] with\r\nundoubted reason, it is not likely that any of those responsible for\r\nthe insult were among those punished. After the siege, \"pitiable it\r\nwas to see, for the innocent suffered and the guilty escaped.\"\r\n\r\nCertain rich citizens bought their lives with large sums, others _were\r\nsold as slaves,_[24] or were hanged or beheaded, or were thrown into\r\nthe Meuse.[25] In the monasteries, life was conceded to the inmates\r\nbut that was all. All their property was confiscated. The Count of St.\r\nPol, now Constable of France, tried to intercede for the citizens with\r\nPhilip who remained at Bouvignes, but to no result. It might have been\r\nchance or it might have been intentional that at last flames completed\r\nthe work of destruction. The abode of Adolph of Cleves, at the corner\r\nof Nôtre Dame, was found to be on fire at about one o'clock in the\r\nmorning of Thursday, August 28th.\r\n\r\nThat Charles was responsible for this conflagration Du Clercq thinks\r\nis incredible.[26] He would certainly have saved all ecclesiastical\r\nproperty which was almost completely consumed. Indeed, Charles gave\r\norders to extinguish the flames as soon as they were discovered, but\r\nevery one was so occupied with saving his own portion of booty that\r\nnothing was accomplished and the town-hall caught fire and the church\r\nof Nôtre Dame. From the latter some ornaments and treasures were saved\r\nand the bones of Ste. Perpète, with other holy relics, were rescued by\r\nCharles himself at risk to his own life.\r\n\r\n    \"It was never known how the fire originated. Some say it was\r\n    due to a defective flue. To my mind,\" [concludes the pious\r\n    historian],[27] \"it was the Divine Will that Dinant should be\r\n    destroyed on account of the pride and ill deeds of the people. I\r\n    trust to God who knows all. The duke's people alone lost more than\r\n    a hundred thousand crowns' value.\"\r\n\r\n_Cy fust Dinant_, \"Dinant was,\" is the sum of his description, four\r\ndays after the conflagration.[28]\r\n\r\nOn September 1st, Philip, who had remained at Bouvignes while all this\r\npassed under the direction of Charles, took boat and sailed down to\r\nNamur. It was almost a triumph,--that trip that proved one of the last\r\never made by the proud duke--and the procession on the river and the\r\nentry into Namur were closed by a humble embassy from Liege in regard\r\nto certain points of their peace.\r\n\r\nDu Clercq gravely relates, by the way, that the Count of St. Pol's men\r\nhad had no part in the plunder of Dinant. This was hard on the\r\npoor fellows. Therefore, Philip turned over to their mercies, as a\r\ncompensation for this deprivation, the little town of Tuin, which had\r\nbeen rebellious and then submitted. Tuin accepted its fate, submitted\r\nto St. Pol, and then compounded the right of pillage for a round sum\r\nof money. Moreover, they promised to lay low their gates and their\r\nwalls and those of St. Trond. In this way, it is said that the\r\nconstable made ten thousand Rhenish florins. Still both he and his men\r\nfelt ill-compensated for the loss of the booty of Dinant.\r\n\r\nCharles continued a kind of harassing warfare on the various towns of\r\nLiege territory. The people of Liege themselves seem to have varied\r\nin their humour towards Charles, sometimes being very humble in their\r\npetitions for peace and again very insolent. As a rule, this conduct\r\nseems to be traceable to their hope of Louis's support. On September\r\n7th, there was one pitched battle where victory decided the final\r\nterms of the general peace, and after various skirmishes and\r\nsubmissions, Charles disbanded his troops for the winter and joined\r\nhis father at Brussels.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Doc. inédits sur l'hist. de France_. \"Mélanges,\" ii.,\r\n398.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Polain, _Récits historiques sur l'ancien pays de Liège_,\r\nI, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Kirk, _Charles the Bold_, i., 329.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Jacques de Hemricourt suggested four chief points of\r\ndifficulty in Liege government:\r\n\r\n1.

In the early\r\nsummer following, on Friday, June 10th, Philip, then at Bruges, was\r\ntaken ill and died on the following Monday, June 13th, between nine\r\nand ten in the evening.[1] Charles was summoned on the Sunday, and it\r\nseemed as though his horse's hoofs hardly struck the pavement as he\r\nrode, so swift was his course on the way to Bruges.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the house where his father lay dying, he was told that\r\nspeech had already ceased, but that there was still life. The count\r\nthrew himself on his knees by the bedside, weeping in all tenderness,\r\nand implored a paternal benediction and pardon for all wherein he had\r\noffended his father. Near the duke stood his confessor who begged the\r\ndying man to make a sign if he could still understand what was said\r\nto him. On this admonition and in reply to his son's prayers, Philip\r\nturned his eyes to Charles, looked at him and pressed the hand which\r\nwas laid upon his own, but further token was beyond his strength. The\r\ncount stayed by his side until he breathed his last.\r\n\r\nThus ended the life of a man who had been a striking figure in Europe\r\nfor forty years. His most fervent dream, indeed, had never been\r\nfulfilled. All his pompous vows to wrest the Holy Land from the\r\ninvading Turks had proved vain. Many years had passed since he had\r\nhad military success of any kind, and even in his earlier life his\r\nsuccesses had been owing to diplomacy and to a happy conjunction\r\nof circumstances rather than to skilful generalship. He possessed\r\npre-eminently the power of personality.\r\n\r\nWhen Duke John of Burgundy fell on the bridge at Montereau and Philip\r\ncame into his heritage, Henry V. of England was in the full flush of\r\nhis prosperity, standing triumphant over England and France, and in a\r\nposition to make good his claim with three stalwart brothers to back\r\nhim. All these young men had died prematurely. Their only descendant\r\nwas Henry VI., and that meagre and wretched representative of the\r\nambitious Henry V. had had no spark of the character of his father and\r\nuncles. The one vigorous element in his life was his wife, Margaret\r\nof Anjou, who diligently exerted herself to keep her husband on his\r\nthrone. In vain were her efforts. By 1467, Edward of York was on that\r\nthrone. Gone, too, was Charles VII., whose father's acts had clouded\r\nhis early, whose son darkened his latter years.\r\n\r\nOut of his group of contemporaries, Duke Philip alone had marched\r\nsteadily to every desired goal. His epitaph gave a fairly accurate\r\nlist of his achievements in doggerel verses:\r\n\r\n  \"John was born of Philip, child of good King John.\r\n  To that John, I, Philip, was born his eldest son.\r\n  Flanders, Artois, and Burgundy his will bequeathed to me\r\n  Therein to follow him and rule them legally.\r\n  With Holland, Zealand, Hainaut, my own realm greater grew.\r\n  Luxemburg, Brabant, Namur soon were added too.\r\n  The Liegeois and the German my lawful rights defied,\r\n  By force of right and arms they have been pacified.\r\n  At one single time against me were maintained\r\n  French, English, German forces,--nothing have they gained.\r\n  Against King Charles the Seventh, I warred in great array.\r\n  From me he begged a peace and king was from that day!\r\n  The mighty conflicts that I fought in all are numbered seven.\r\n  Not once was I defeated. To God the praise be given.\r\n  Time and time again Liege and Ghent revolted,\r\n  But I put them down. I would not be insulted.\r\n  In Barrois and Lorraine, King René warred upon me.\r\n  Of Sicily erst king, captivity soon won he.\r\n  Louis, son of Charles, depressed and refugee,\r\n  From me received his crown. Five years my guest was he.\r\n  Edward, Duke of York, fled, wretched, to my land;\r\n  That now he's England's king is due my aid and hand.\r\n  To defend the Church, which is the House Divine,\r\n  The Golden Fleece was founded, that great order mine.\r\n  Christian faith to succour in vigour and in strength,\r\n  My galleys sailed the sea in all its dreary length.\r\n  In later days I planned and most sincerely meant\r\n  To take the field myself, but Death did that prevent.\r\n  When Eugene the Pope by the council was disdained,\r\n  Through my control alone as Pope was he retained.\r\n  In 1467, Time my goal has set.\r\n  When I am seventy-one, I pay Dame Nature's debt.\r\n  With father and grandfather, I now lie buried here.\r\n  As in life I ever was their equal and their peer.\r\n  Good Jesu was my guide in every word and deed,\r\n  Beseech him every one that Heaven be my meed!\"\r\n\r\nThe territories thus named, that passed to the new duke, covered\r\na goodly space of earth. Had Philip not slacked his ambition at a\r\ncritical time, undoubtedly he could have left a royal rather than a\r\nducal crown to his son. He did not so will it, and, moreover, in a\r\nway he had receded from his independence as he had accepted feudal\r\nobligations towards Louis XI. which he never had towards Charles VII.\r\n\r\nLured by the hope of becoming prime adviser of the French king, he had\r\nemphasised his position as first peer of France. Thus it was as Duke\r\nof Burgundy _par excellence_ that Philip died, as the typical peer\r\nwhose luxury and magnificence far surpassed the state possible to his\r\nacknowledged liege. To his son was bequeathed the task of attempting\r\nto turn that ducal state into state royal, and of establishing a realm\r\nwhich should hold the balance of power between France and Germany.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt in Charles's mind as to which was the greater, the\r\ncleverer, the more powerful of the two, Louis the king and Charles the\r\nduke. Had not the former been a beggarly suppliant at his father's\r\ngates, as dauphin? As king, had he not been forced to yield at the\r\ngates of his own capital to every demand made by Charles, standing as\r\nthe conscientious representative of the public welfare of France?\r\n\r\nHad not Louis befriended the contumelious neighbour of Charles, only\r\nto learn that his Burgundian cousin could and would deal summarily\r\nwith all protests against his authority among the lesser folk on\r\nNetherland territory?\r\n\r\nThe Croys made an attempt to gain the new duke's friendship, as\r\nappears from this letter to Duke Charles:\r\n\r\n    \"Our very excellent lord, we have heard that it has pleased Our\r\n    Lord to take to Himself and to withdraw from the world the good\r\n    Duke Philip, our beloved lord and father, prince of glorious\r\n    memory, august duke, most Christian champion of the faith, patron\r\n    and pattern of the virtues and honours of Christianity, and the\r\n    dread of infidel lands. By his valorous deeds, he has won an\r\n    immortal name among living men, and deserves to our mind to find\r\n    grace before the merciful bounty of God whom we implore to pardon\r\n    his faults.\r\n\r\n    \"Alas! our most doughty seigneur, thus dolorous death shows what\r\n    is to be expected by all mortals. How many lands, how many nobles,\r\n    how many peoples, how many treasures, and how many powers would\r\n    have been ready to prevent what has come to pass, and how many\r\n    prayers would have risen to God could He have prevented this\r\n    death!...\r\n\r\n    \"Death is inevitable, and the death of the good is the end of all\r\n    evils and the beginning of all benefits, but still your loss\r\n    and ours cannot pass without affliction. Nevertheless, our most\r\n    puissant lord, when we consider that we are not left orphans, and\r\n    that you, his only son, remain to fill his place, this is a cause\r\n    for comfort.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"We implore you to be pleased to count us your loyal subjects\r\n    and very humble servitors and to permit us to go to you, to thus\r\n    declare ourselves, etc.\r\n\r\n    \"A. DE CROY, \"J. DE CROY.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the duke's death, Olivier de La Marche was in England,\r\nwhither he had accompanied the Bastard of Burgundy on a mission to\r\nKing Edward.[2] Right royally had the latter received the embassy.\r\n\r\n    \"Clad in purple, the garter on his leg and a great baton in his\r\n    hand, he seemed, indeed, a personage worthy of being king, for he\r\n    was a fine prince with a grand manner. A count held the sword\r\n    in front of him, and around his throne were from twenty to\r\n    twenty-five old councillors, white-haired and looking like\r\n    senators gathered together to advise their master.\"\r\n\r\nThus appeared Edward on the occasion of a tourney given in honour\r\nof the embassy which La Marche proceeds to describe in detail. The\r\nBastard of Burgundy, wearing the Burgundian coat-of-arms with a bar\r\nsinister, made a fine record for himself.\r\n\r\nAfter the tournament he invited the ladies to a Sunday dinner,\r\n\r\n    \"especially the Queen and her sisters and made great preparations\r\n    therefor and then we departed, Thomas de Loreille, Bailiff of\r\n    Caux, and I to go to Brittany to accomplish our embassy. We\r\n    arrived at Pleume and were obliged to await wind and boats to\r\n    go into Brittany. While there, came the news that the Duke of\r\n    Burgundy was dead. You may believe how great was the bastard's\r\n    mourning when he heard of his father's death, and how the nobility\r\n    who were with him mourned too. Their pleasures were melted into\r\n    tears and lamentations for he died like a prince in all valour.\r\n\r\n    \"In his life he accomplished two things to the full. One was he\r\n    died as the richest prince of his time, for he left four hundred\r\n    thousand crowns of gold cash, seventy-two thousand marks of silver\r\n    plate, without counting rich tapestries, rings, gold dishes\r\n    garnished with precious stones, a large and well equipped library,\r\n    and rich furniture. For the second, he died as the most liberal\r\n    duke of his time. He married his nieces at his own expense; he\r\n    bore the whole cost of great wars several times. At his own\r\n    expense, he refitted the church and chapel at Jerusalem. He gave\r\n    ten thousand crowns to build the tower of Burgundy at Rhodes; ...\r\n    No one went from him who was not well recompensed. The state\r\n    he maintained was almost royal. For five years he supported\r\n    Monseigneur the Dauphin, and was a prince so renowned that all the\r\n    world spoke well of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bastard of Burgundy took leave of the English court and hastened\r\nto Bruges to join his brother, the Count of Charolais, who received\r\nhim warmly. \"Henceforth,\" explains Olivier, \"when I mention the said\r\ncount I will call him the Duke of Burgundy as is reasonable.\"\r\n\r\nSolemnly was the prince's body carried into the church of St. Donat\r\nin Bruges, there to repose until it could be taken to Burgundy to be\r\nburied at Dijon with his ancestors. La Marche dismisses the funeral\r\nwith a brief phrase as he was not himself present at Bruges, being\r\nbusied in Brittany. There was a memorial service there, the finest\r\nhe ever saw. The arms of Burgundy were inserted in the chapel\r\ndecorations, not merely pinned on,[2] a fact that impressed the\r\nchronicler. No nobles, not even those from Flanders, were permitted to\r\nput on mourning. The Duke of Brittany declared that none but him was\r\nworthy of the honour for so high a prince.\r\n\r\n    \"So he alone wore mourning. At the end of the service I went to\r\n    thank him for the reverence he had shown the House of Burgundy,\r\n    and he responded that he had only done his duty. Then I finished\r\n    my business as quickly as I could and crossed the sea again and\r\n    returned to my new master.\"\r\n\r\nIn his treatise on the eminent deeds of the Duke of Burgundy,[4]\r\nChastellain recounts, more at length than La Marche, all that his\r\ngreat master had accomplished. Then he proceeds to describe the duke\r\nas he knew him.\r\n\r\n    He was medium in height, rather slight but straight as a rush,\r\n    strong in hip and in arm, his figure well-knit. His neck was\r\n    admirably proportioned to his body, his hand and foot were\r\n    slender, he had more bone than flesh, but his veins were\r\n    full-blooded. Like all his ancestors, his face was long, as was\r\n    his nose, his forehead high. His complexion was brunette, his hair\r\n    brownish, soft, and straight, his beard and eye-brows the same\r\n    colour, but the former curly, the latter were bushy and inclined\r\n    to stand up like horns when he was angry. His mouth was\r\n    well-proportioned, his lips full and high-coloured; his eyes were\r\n    grey, sometimes arrogant but usually amiable in expression.\r\n    His personality corresponded perfectly to his appearance. His\r\n    countenance showed his character, and his character was a witness\r\n    to the truth of his physiognomy. Nothing was contradictory,\r\n    perfect was the harmony between the inner and the outer man,\r\n    between the nobility of thought and the simple dignity,\r\n    well-poised and graceful. Among the great ones of this earth, he\r\n    was like a star in heaven. Every line proclaimed \"I am a prince\r\n    and a man unique.\"\r\n\r\n    It was for his bearing rather than his beauty that he commanded\r\n    universal admiration. In a stable he would have looked like an\r\n    image in a temple. In a hall he was the decoration. Whereever his\r\n    body was, there, too, was his spirit, ready for the demands of the\r\n    hour. He was singularly joyous and nicely tempered in speech with\r\n    so much personal magnetism that he could mollify any enemy if he\r\n    could only meet him face to face. His dress was always rich and\r\n    appropriate. He was skilful in horsemanship, in archery, and in\r\n    tennis, but his chief amusement was the chase. He liked to linger\r\n    at the table and demanded good serving but was really moderate in\r\n    his tastes, as often he neglected pheasant for a bit of Mayence\r\n    ham or salted beef. Oaths and abuse were never heard from him. To\r\n    all alike his speech was courteous even when there was nothing to\r\n    be gained.\r\n\r\n    \"Never, I assert, did falsehood pass his lips, his mouth was equal\r\n    to his seal and his spoken word to his written. Loyal as fine gold\r\n    and whole as an egg.\" Chastellain repeats himself somewhat in\r\n    the profusion of his eulogy, but such are the main points of his\r\n    characterisation. Then he proceeds to some qualifications:\r\n\r\n    \"In order to avoid the charge of flattery, I acknowledge that he\r\n    had faults. None is perfect except God. Often he was very careless\r\n    in administration, and he neglected questions of justice, of\r\n    finance, and of commerce in a way that may redound to the injury\r\n    of his house. The excuse urged is that it was his deputies who\r\n    were at fault. The answer to that is that he trusted too much to\r\n    deputies and should not be excused for his confidence. A ruler\r\n    ought to understand his business himself.\r\n\r\n    \"Also he had the vices of the flesh. He pleased his heart at the\r\n    desire of his eyes. At the desire of his heart he multiplied his\r\n    pleasures. His wishes were easy to attain. What he wanted was\r\n    offered freely. He neglected the virtuous and holy lady his wife,\r\n    a Christian saint, chaste and charitable. For this I offer no\r\n    excuse. To God I leave the cause.\r\n\r\n    \"Another fault was that he was not wise in his treatment of his\r\n    nobles. Especially in his old age he often preferred the less\r\n    worthy, the less capable advisers. The answer to this charge is\r\n    that, as his health failed, whoever was by his side obtained\r\n    ascendency over him and succeeded in keeping the others at a\r\n    distance. Ergo, theirs is the malice and the excuse is to the\r\n    princely invalid. In his solitude even valets used their power, as\r\n    is not wonderful.\r\n\r\n    \"He went late to mass and often out of hours. Sometimes he had\r\n    it celebrated at two o'clock or even three, and in so doing he\r\n    exceeded all Christian observance. For this there is no excuse\r\n    that I dare allege. I leave it to the judgment of God. He had,\r\n    indeed, obtained dispensation from the pope for causes which he\r\n    explained, _and he only_ is responsible. God alone can judge about\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    \"It would be a dreadful shame if his soul suffered for this\r\n    neglect in lifetime. Earth would not suffice to deplore, nor the\r\n    nature of man to lament the perdition of such a soul and of such a\r\n    prince. Hell is not worthy of him nor good enough to lodge him. 0\r\n    God, who rescued Trajan from Hades for a single virtuous act, do\r\n    not suffer this man to descend therein!\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus tried his best to give a vivid description of the father's\r\npersonality, while acknowledging that he is not sure of the fate of\r\nhis soul, the chronicler decides that it would be an excellent moment\r\nto paint the son, too, for all time, in view of his mortality. \"I will\r\nuse the past tense so that my words may be good for always.\"\r\n\r\nDuke Charles was shorter and stouter than Duke Philip, but well\r\nformed, strong in arm and thigh. His shoulders were rather thick-set\r\nand a trifle stooping, but his body was well adapted to activity.\r\nThe contour of his face was rounder than that of his father, his\r\ncomplexion brunette. His eyes were black and laughing, angelically\r\nclear. When he was sunk in thought it seemed as though his father\r\nlooked out of them. Like his father's mouth was his, full and red. His\r\nnose was pronounced, his beard brown, and his hair black. His forehead\r\nwas fine, his neck white and well set, though always bent as he\r\nwalked. He certainly was not as straight as Philip, but nevertheless\r\nhe was a fine prince with a fair outer man.\r\n\r\nWhen he began to speak he often found difficulty in expressing\r\nhimself, but once started his speech became fluent, even eloquent.\r\nHis voice was fine and clear, but he could not sing, although he had\r\nstudied the technique and was fond of music. In conversation he was\r\nmore logical than his father, but very tenacious of his own opinion\r\nand vehement in its expression, although, at the bottom, he was just\r\nto all men.\r\n\r\nIn council he was keen, subtle, and ready. He listened to others'\r\narguments judicially and gave them due weight before his own concluded\r\nthe discussion. He was attentive to his own business to a fault, for\r\nhe was rather more industrious than became a prince. Economical of his\r\nown time, he demanded conscience of his subordinates and worked them\r\nvery hard. He was fond of his servants and fairly affable, though\r\noccasionally sharp in his words. His memory was long and his anger\r\ndangerous. As a rule, good sense swayed him, but being naturally\r\nimpetuous there was often a struggle between impulse and reason.\r\n\r\nHe was a God-fearing prince, was devoted to the Virgin Mary, rigid in\r\nhis fasts, lavish in charity. He was determined to avoid death and\r\nto hold on to his own, tooth and nail, and was his father's peer in\r\nvalour. Like his father, he dressed richly; unlike him, he cared more\r\nfor silver than for jewels. He lived more chastely than is usual to\r\nprinces and was always master of himself. He drank little wine, though\r\nhe liked it, because he found that it engendered fever in him. His\r\nonly beverage was water just coloured with wine. He was inclined to no\r\nindulgence or wantonness. \"At the hour in which I write his taste for\r\nhard labour is excessive, but in other respects his good sense has\r\ndominated him, at least thus far. It is to be hoped that as his reign\r\ngrows older he will curb his over-strenuous industry.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the duke's sympathies, Chastellain regrets that circumstances\r\nhave turned him towards England. Naturally he belonged to the French,\r\nand it was a pity that the machinations of the king, \"whose crooked\r\nways are well known to God, have forced him into self-defence. Yet on\r\nhis forehead he wears the fleur-de-lys.\"\r\n\r\nChastellain acknowledges that Charles is accused of avarice, but\r\ndefends him on the ground that he has been driven into collecting\r\na large army. \"A penny in the chest is worth three in the purse of\r\nanother.\" \"To take precautions in advance is a way to save honour and\r\nproperty,\" prudently adds the historian, who evidently flourishes\r\nhis maxims to strengthen his own appreciation of the duke's economy,\r\nwhich, quite as evidently, is not pleasing to him. \"I have seen him\r\nthe very opposite of miserly, open-handed and liberal, rejoicing in\r\nlargesse. When he came into his seigniory his nature did not change.\"\r\nIt was simply the exigencies of his critical position that forced him\r\nto restrain his natural propensities and thus to gain the undeserved\r\nreputation for parsimony.\r\n\r\nIt was also said that he was a very hard taskmaster, but as a matter\r\nof fact he demanded nothing of his soldiers that he was not ready to\r\nundertake himself. Like a true duke, he was his own commander, drew up\r\nhis own troops himself in battle array, and then passed from one end\r\nof the line to the other, encouraging the men individually with cheery\r\nwords, promising them glory and profit, and pledging himself to share\r\ntheir dangers. In victory he was restrained and showed more mercy than\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\nAfter expatiating on the points where Charles was like his\r\nfather--conventional princely qualities --Chastellain adds: \"In some\r\nrespects they differed. The one was cold and the other boiling with\r\nardour; the one slow and prone to delay, the other strenuous in his\r\npromptness; the elder negligent of his own concerns, the younger\r\ndiligent and alert. They differed in the amount of time consumed at\r\nmeals and in the number of guests whom they entertained. They differed\r\nmore or less in their voluptuousness and in their expenditures and in\r\nthe way in which they took solace and amusement.\" But in all other\r\nrespects, \"in life they marched side by side as equals and if it\r\nplease God He will be their conductor in glory everlasting\" is the\r\nfinal assurance of their eulogist.\r\n\r\nYet, lavish as the Burgundian poet is in his adjectives about his\r\npatron, there is considerable discrimination between his summaries of\r\nthe two dukes. It is very evident that from his accession Charles\r\nwas less of a favourite than his father. While endeavouring to be\r\nas complimentary as possible, distrust of his capacities creeps out\r\nbetween the lines. Chastellain died in 1475, and thus never saw\r\nCharles's final disaster. But the violence of his character had\r\ninspired lack of confidence in his power of achievement, a violence\r\nthat made people dislike him as Philip with all his faults was never\r\ndisliked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Du Clercq, iv., 302 _et seq_. Erasmus was born in this\r\nyear, 1467.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: II., 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"Non par armes attachées à espingles.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Oeuvres_, vii., 213.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNJOYOUS ENTRY\r\n\r\n1467\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the dauphin was crowned at Rheims, he was monarch over all his\r\ndomains. Charles of Burgundy, on the other hand, had a series of\r\nceremonies to perform before he was properly invested with the various\r\ntitles worn by his father. Each duchy, countship, seigniory had to be\r\ntaken in turn. Ghent was the first capital visited. Then he had\r\nto exchange pledges of fidelity with his Flemish subjects before\r\nreceiving recognition as Count of Flanders.\r\n\r\nAccording to the custom of his predecessors, Charles stayed at the\r\nlittle village of Swynaerde, near Ghent, the night before he made his\r\n\"joyous entry\" into that city. It had chanced that the day selected by\r\nCharles for the event was St. Lievin's Day and a favourite holiday of\r\nthe workers of Ghent. The saint's bones, enclosed conveniently in a\r\nportable shrine, rested in the cathedral church, whence they were\r\ncarried once a year by the fifty-two gilds in solemn procession to\r\nthe little village of Houthem, where the blessed saint had suffered\r\nmartyrdom in the seventh century. All day and all night the saint's\r\ndevotees, the Fools of St. Lievin, as they were called, remained at\r\nthis spot. Merry did the festival become as the hours wore on, for\r\ngood cheer was carried thither as well as the sacred shrine.\r\n\r\nNow the magistrates were a little apprehensive about the rival claims\r\nof the new count of Flanders and the old saint of Ghent. They knew\r\nthat they could not cut short the time-honoured celebration for the\r\nsake of the sovereign's inauguration, so they decided to prolong the\r\nformer, and directed that the saint should leave town on Saturday and\r\nnot return until Monday. This left Sunday free for the young count's\r\nentry. It probably seemed a very convenient conjunction of events to\r\nthe city fathers, because the more turbulent portion of the citizens\r\nwas sure to follow the saint.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Charles made a very quiet and dignified entrance,[1]\r\nhaving paused at the gates to listen to the fair words of Master\r\nMathys de Groothuse as he extolled the virtues of the late Count of\r\nFlanders, and requested God to receive the present one, when he, too,\r\nwas forced to leave earth, as graciously as Ghent was receiving him\r\nthat day. All passed well; oaths of fealty were duly taken and given\r\nat the church of St. John the Baptist. Charles himself pulled the\r\nbell rope according to the ancient Flemish custom, and the Count of\r\nFlanders was in possession. This all took place in the morning of June\r\n28th. At the close of the ceremonies Charles withdrew to his hotel and\r\nthe magistrates to their dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe devotees of St. Lievin prolonged their holiday until Monday\r\nafternoon. It was five o'clock[2] when the revellers returned to\r\nGhent. Many of the saint's followers were, by that time, more or less\r\nunder the influence of the contents of the casks which had formed part\r\nof the outward-bound burden. The protracted holiday-making had its\r\nnatural sequence. There was, however, too much method in the next\r\nproceedings for it to be attributed wholly to emotional inebriety.\r\n\r\nThe procession passed through the city gate and entered a narrow\r\nstreet near the corn market, where stood a little house used as\r\nheadquarters for the collection of the _cueillotte_, a tax on every\r\narticle brought into the city for sale, and one particularly obnoxious\r\nto the people. Suddenly a cry was raised and echoed from rank to rank\r\nof St. Lievin's escort, \"Down with the _cueillotte_.\"\r\n\r\nThen with the ingenious humour of a Celtic crowd, quick to take a\r\nfantastic advantage of a situation, a second cry was heard: \"St.\r\nLievin must go through the house. Lievin is a saint who never turns\r\naside from his route.\"\r\n\r\nDelightful thought, followed by speedy action. Axes were produced and\r\nwielded to good effect.\r\n\r\nDown came the miniature customs-house in a flash. Little pieces of\r\nthe ruin were elevated on sticks and carried by some of the rabble as\r\nstandards with the cry \"I have it--I have it.\" As they marched\r\nthe procession was constantly augmented and the cries become more\r\ndecidedly revolutionary: \"Kill, kill these craven spoilers of God and\r\nof the world.[2] Where are they? Let us seek them out and slay them in\r\ntheir houses, those who have flourished at our pitiable expense.\"\r\n\r\nThis was rank rebellion. Even under cover of St. Lievin's mantle,\r\nresistance to regularly instituted customs could hardly be described\r\nby any other name. Excited by their own temerity, the crowd now surged\r\non to the great market-place in front of the Hôtel de Ville, where the\r\nFriday market is held, instead of returning the saint promptly to his\r\nsafe abiding-place as was meet.\r\n\r\nThere the lawless deeds--lawless to the duke's mind certainly--became\r\nmore audacious. Counterparts of the very banners whose prohibition\r\nhad been part of the sentence in 1453 were unfurled,[4] and their\r\npossession alone proved insurrectionary premeditation on the part of\r\nthe gild leaders. Ghent was in open revolt, and the young duke in\r\ntheir midst felt it was an open insult to him as sovereign count.\r\n\r\nHis messenger failed to return from the market-place. His master\r\nbecame impatient and followed him to the scene of action with a small\r\nescort. As they drew near, the crowd thickened and hedged them in. The\r\nnobles became alarmed and urged the duke to return, but cries from\r\nthe crowd promised safety to his person. To the steps of the Hôtel de\r\nVille rode the duke, his face dark, menacing with suppressed wrath.[5]\r\n\r\nAs he dismounted, he turned towards a man whom he thought he saw\r\negging on a disturbance and struck him with his riding whip, saying,\r\n\"I know you.\" The man was quick enough to realise the value of the\r\nduke's violence at that moment and cried, \"Strike again,\" but the\r\nSeigneur Groothuse, who had already tried to check Charles's anger and\r\nto curb the popular turbulence, exclaimed, \"For the love of God do\r\nnot strike again!\" The wiser burgher at once understood the unstable\r\ntemper of the mob, which had been fairly civil to the duke up to this\r\nmoment. There were ugly murmurs to be heard that the blow would cost\r\nhim dear.\r\n\r\n    \"Indeed,\" says the courtly Chastellain, \"the mischief was so\r\n    imminent that God alone averted it, and there was not an archer\r\n    or noble or man so full of assurance that he did not tremble with\r\n    fear, nor one who would not have preferred to be in India for his\r\n    own safety. Especially were they in terror for their young prince,\r\n    who, they thought, was exposed to a dolorous death.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Groothuse alone who averted disaster:\r\n\r\n    \"Do you not see that your life and ours hang on a silken thread?\r\n    Do you think you can coerce a rabble like this by threats and hard\r\n    words--a rabble who at this moment do not value you more than the\r\n    least of us? They are beside themselves, they have neither reason\r\n    nor understanding.[6]... If you are ready to die, I am not, except\r\n    in spite of myself. You must try quite a different method--appease\r\n    them by sweetness and save your house and your life.\r\n\r\n    \"What could you do alone? How the gods would laugh! Your courage\r\n    is out of place here unless it enables you to calm yourself and\r\n    give an example to those poor sheep, wretched misled people whom\r\n    you must soothe. Go down in God's name. [They were within the town\r\n    hall.] Show yourself and you will make an impression by your good\r\n    sense and all will go well.\"\r\n\r\nTo this eminently sound advice the young duke yielded. He appeared on\r\na balcony or on the upper steps of the town hall and stood ready to\r\nharangue his unruly and turbulent subjects. A moment sufficed to still\r\nthe turmoil and the silence showed a readiness to hear him speak.\r\n\r\nCharles was not perfectly at ease in Flemish, but he was wise enough\r\nto use that tongue. One trait of the Ghenters was respect for the\r\nperson of their overlord. When that overlord showed any disposition to\r\nmeet them half-way the response was usually immediate. So it was now.\r\nThe crowd which had been attending to St. Lievin, and not to the\r\nduke's joyous entry, suddenly remembered that his welcome had been\r\nstrangely ignored. Their grumblings changed to greetings. \"Take heart,\r\nMonseigneur. Have no fear. For you we will live and die and none shall\r\nbe so audacious as to harm you. If there be evil fellows with no bump\r\nof reverence, endure it for the moment. Later you shall be avenged. No\r\ntime now for fear.\"\r\n\r\nThis sounded better. Charles was sufficiently appeased to address the\r\ncrowd as \"My children,\" and to assure them that if they would but meet\r\nhim in peaceful conference, their grievances should be redressed.\r\n\"Welcome, welcome! we are indeed your children and recognise your\r\ngoodness.\"\r\n\r\nThen Groothuse followed with a longer speech than was possible either\r\nto Charles's Flemish or to his mood. This address was equally\r\nwell received, and matters were in train for the appointment of a\r\nconference between popular representatives and the new Count of\r\nFlanders, when suddenly a tall, rude fellow climbed up to the balcony\r\nfrom the square. Using an iron gauntlet as a gavel to strike on\r\nthe wall, he commanded attention and turned gravely to address the\r\naudience as though he were on the accredited list of speakers:\r\n\r\n\"My brothers, down there assembled to set your complaints before your\r\nprince, your first wish--is it not?--is to punish the ill governors of\r\nthis town and those who have defrauded you and him alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" was the quick answer of the fickle crowd.--\"You desire the\r\nsuppression of the _cueillotte_, do you not?\"--\"Yes, yes.\"--\"You\r\nwant all your gates opened again, your banners restored, and your\r\nprivileges reinforced as of yore?\"--\"Yes, yes.\" The self-appointed\r\nenvoy turned calmly to Charles and said:\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur, this is what the citizens have come together to ask you.\r\nThis is your task. I have said it in their behalf, and, as you hear,\r\nthey make my words their own.\"\r\n\r\nNoteworthy is Chastellain's pious and horrified ejaculation over the\r\nextraordinary insolence of this big villain, who thus audaciously\r\nassociated himself with his betters: \"O glorious Majesty of God,\r\nthink of such an outrageous and intolerable piece of villainy being\r\ncommitted before the eyes of a prince! For a low man to venture to\r\ncome and stand side by side with such a gentleman as our seigneur, and\r\nto proffer words inimical to his authority--words the poorest noble in\r\nthe world would hardly have endured! And yet it was necessary for this\r\nnoble prince to endure and to tolerate it for the moment, and needful\r\nthat he should let pass as a pleasantry what was enough to kill him\r\nwith grief.\"\r\n\r\nGroothuse's answer to the man was mild. Evidently he did not think it\r\nwas a safe moment to exasperate the mob: \"'My friend, there was no\r\nnecessity of your intruding up here, a place reserved for the prince\r\nand his nobles. From below, you could have been heard and Monseigneur\r\ncould have answered you as well there as here. He requires no advocate\r\nto make him content his people. You are a strange master. Get down. Go\r\ndown below and keep to your mates. Monseigneur will do right by every\r\none.'\r\n\r\n\"Off went the rascal and I do not know what became of him. The duke\r\nand his nobles were simply struck dumb by the scamp's outrage and his\r\nimpudent daring.\"\r\n\r\nThe sober report[7] is less detailed and elaborate, but the thread is\r\nthe same. Monseigneur, having returned to his hotel, sent Monseigneur\r\nde la Groothuse, Jean Petitpas, and Richard Utenhove back to the\r\nmarket to invite the people to put their grievances in writing. A\r\ndraft was made and carried to the duke. After he had examined it and\r\ndiscussed it with his council, he sent Monseigneur de la Groothuse\r\nback to the market-place to tell the people that he wanted to sleep\r\non the proposition and would give his answer at an early hour on the\r\nmorrow. All through the night the people remained in arms on the\r\nmarket-place. At about eight o'clock on June 30th Groothuse returned,\r\nthanked the people in the count's name for having kept such good\r\nwatch, and was answered by cries of \"_À bas la cueillotte_.\"\r\n\r\nThen he assured them that all was pardoned and that they should obtain\r\nwhat they had asked in the draft. Only he requested them to appoint a\r\ncommittee of six to present their demands to Monseigneur and then to\r\ngo home. This they did. St. Lievin was restored to the church and his\r\nfollowers betook themselves to the gates specified in the treaty of\r\nGaveren. These they broke down, and also destroyed another house where\r\nwas a tax collector's office.\r\n\r\n\"The report of these events carried to Monseigneur did not have a good\r\neffect upon his spirit. On the morrow Monseigneur quitted the city.\"\r\nThe members of the corporation with the two deans and the popular\r\ncommittee of six having obtained audience before his departure,\r\nGroothuse acted as spokesman: \"We implore you in all humility to\r\npardon us for the insult you have suffered, and to sign the paper\r\npresented. The bad have had more authority than the good, which could\r\nnot be prevented, but we know truly that if the draft is not signed\r\nthey will kill us.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident in all this story that the municipal authorities were\r\nfrightened to death and that Charles allowed himself to be restrained\r\nto an extraordinary extent considering the undoubted provocation. His\r\nreasons for conciliatory measures were two, and literally were his\r\nducats and his daughter. He had with him all the portable treasure and\r\nready money that his father had had at Bruges, a large treasure\r\nand one on which he counted for his immediate military\r\noperations--operations very important to the position as a European\r\npower which he ardently desired to attain.\r\n\r\nStill more important was the fact that his young daughter, Mary, now\r\neleven years old, was living in Ghent, to a certain degree the ward of\r\nthe city. If the unruly majority should realise their strength what\r\neasier for them than to seize the treasure and hold the daughter as\r\nhostage, until her father had acceded to every demand, and until\r\ndemocracy was triumphant not only in Ghent but in the neighbouring\r\ncities?\r\n\r\nCharles simply did not dare attempt further coercion of the democratic\r\nspirit until he was beyond the walls. It is evident that he was\r\ncompletely taken by surprise at Ghent's attitude towards him, as the\r\ncity had always professed great personal attachment to him. But there\r\nwas a difference between being heir and sovereign. The agreement was\r\nsigned, with a mental reservation on the part of the Duke of Burgundy.\r\nHe only intended to keep his pledge until he could see his way clear\r\nto make terms better to his liking.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, June 30th, Charles left Ghent, taking his daughter and his\r\ntreasure away, but a safe shelter for both was not easy to find.\r\nThe duke's anticipations of the effect of Ghent's actions upon her\r\nneighbours were quickly proved to be no idle fears. There were revolts\r\nof more or less importance at Mechlin, at Antwerp, at Brussels, and\r\nother places. Moreover, there was serious discussion in the estates\r\nassembled at Louvain as to whether Charles should be acknowledged as\r\nDuke of Brabant, or whether the claims of his cousin, the Count of\r\nNevers, should be considered as heir to Philip's predecessor, for the\r\nlate duke's title had never been considered perfect.\r\n\r\nLouis XI. seized the opportunity to urge the pretensions of the\r\nlatter, and there were many reasons to recommend him, in the\r\nestimation of the Brabanters, who saw advantage in having a sovereign\r\nexclusively their own, instead of one with the widespread geographical\r\ninterests of the Burgundian family. The final decision was, however,\r\nfor Charles; a notice of the resolution of the deputies was sent to\r\nhim at Mechlin, and he made his formal \"entry\" into Louvain, where he\r\nreceived homage from the nobles, the good cities, and the university.\r\n\r\nThe various insurgent manifestations were promptly quelled one after\r\nanother, but, with a nature that neither forgot nor forgave, the duke\r\nwas strongly impressed by them as personal insults. He blamed Ghent\r\nfor their occurrence and deeply resented every one. Throughout\r\nPhilip's whole career he remembered the localised tenure of his titles\r\nand the fact that they were not perfectly incontestable. For his own\r\nadvantage he often found a conciliatory attitude the best policy.\r\nCharles considered all his rights heaven-born. Questioning his\r\nauthority was rank rebellion. That he had accepted advice in regard\r\nto Ghent, and had been ruled by expediency for the nonce, did not\r\nmitigate his intense bitterness.\r\n\r\nIn another town that gave him serious trouble at this time, nothing\r\nled him to curb the severity of his measures. Though only a\r\n\"protector,\" not an overlord, when he suppressed a rebellion in Liege\r\nhe rigorously exacted the most complete and humiliating penalties. The\r\ncity charters were abrogated, all privileges were forfeited. As\r\nan unprotected village must Liege stand henceforth, walls and\r\nfortifications rased to the ground.\r\n\r\n    \"The perron on the market-place of the said town shall be taken\r\n    down, and then Monseigneur the duke shall treat it according to\r\n    his pleasure. The city may not remake the said perron, nor replace\r\n    another like it in the market-place or elsewhere in the city. Nor\r\n    shall the said perron appear in the coat-of-arms of Liege.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible indignity for the city and a clear proof of their\r\nfear of their bishop's friend.\r\n\r\nThe episode impressed the citizens of Ghent with the duke's power, and\r\nmade the more timorous anxious to erase the event of 1467 from his\r\nmind. The peace party finally prevailed in their arguments, but the\r\nscene of abnegation and self-humiliation crowning their apology was\r\nnot enacted until eighteen months after the events apologised for,\r\nwhen the new duke had still further proven his metal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gachard, _Doc. inéd_., i., 210, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Some authorities make this five A.M., but the _Rapport_\r\nis probably correct.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Chastellain, v., 260 _et passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: So say some historians.

Always feeling a\r\ncloser bond with his mother than with his father, Charles's sympathy\r\nhad ever been towards the Lancastrian party in England, the family to\r\nwhom Isabella of Portugal was closely related. Only the necessity for\r\nmaking a strong alliance against Louis XI. turned him to seek a bride\r\nfrom the House of York. It was on this business that La Marche and\r\nthe great Bastard were engaged when Philip's death interrupted the\r\ndiscussion, which Charles did not immediately resume on his own\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nPending the final decision in regard to this important indication of\r\nhis international policy, the duke busied himself with the adjustment\r\nof his court, there being many points in which he did not intend to\r\nfollow his father's usage.[1] Philip's lavishness, without too close\r\na query as to the disposition of every penny, was naturally very\r\nagreeable to his courtiers. There was a liberal air about his\r\nhouseholds. It was easy to come and go, and it was pleasant to have\r\nthe handling of money and the giving of orders--orders which were\r\nfulfilled and richly paid without haggling. Charles had other notions.\r\nHe was willing to pay, but he wanted to be sure of an adequate\r\nreturn. How he started in on his administration with reform ideas is\r\ndelightfully told by Chastellain.[2]\r\n\r\nOne of his first measures when he was finally established at Brussels\r\nwas to secure more speedy execution of justice. He appointed a new\r\nprovost, \"a dangerous varlet of low estate, but excellently fitted to\r\ncarry out perilous work.\" Then he determined to settle petty civil\r\nsuits himself, as there were many which had dragged on for a long\r\ntime. In order to do this and to receive complaints from poor people,\r\nhe arranged to give audience three times a week, Monday, Wednesday,\r\nand Friday, after dinner. On these occasions he required the\r\nattendance of all his nobles, seated before him on benches, each\r\naccording to his rank. Excuses were not pleasantly accepted, so that\r\nfew places were empty. Charles himself was elevated on a high throne\r\ncovered with cloth of gold, whence he pompously pronounced judgments\r\nand heard and answered petitions, a process that sometimes lasted two\r\nor three hours and was exceedingly tiresome to the onlookers.\r\n\r\n    \"In outer appearance it seemed a magnificent course of action and\r\n    very praiseworthy. But in my time I have never heard of nor seen\r\n    like action taken by prince or king, nor any proceedings in the\r\n    least similar.\r\n\r\n    \"When the duke went through the city from place to place and from\r\n    church to church, it was wonderful how much state and order was\r\n    maintained and what a grand escort he had. Never a knight so old\r\n    or so young who dared absent himself and never a squire was bold\r\n    enough to squeeze himself into the knights' places.\"\r\n\r\nAt the levee, the same rigid ceremony was observed. Every one had\r\nto wait his turn in his proper room--the squires in the first, the\r\nknights in the second, and so on. All left the palace together to go\r\nto mass. As soon as the offering was made all the nobles were free\r\nto dine, but they were obliged to report themselves to the duke\r\nimmediately after his repast. Any failure caused the forfeiture of the\r\nfee for the day. It was all very orderly and very dull.\r\n\r\nThus Charles of Burgundy felt that he was law-giver, paternal guide,\r\nphilosopher, and friend to his people. From time to time he delivered\r\nharangues to his court, veritable sermons. He obtained hearing, but\r\ncertainly did not win popularity. The adulatory phrases used as mere\r\nconventionalities seemed to have actually turned his head. And those\r\nstock phrases were very grandiloquent. There is no doubt that such\r\ncomparisons were used as Chastellain puts into the mouths of the first\r\ndeputation from Ghent to ask pardon for the sins committed at the\r\ndolorous unjoyous entry into the Flemish capital.[2]\r\n\r\n    \"My very excellent seigneur, when you who hold double place, place\r\n    of God and place of man, and have in yourself the double nature\r\n    by office and commission in divine estate, and as your noble\r\n    discretion knows and is cognisant, like God the Father, Creator,\r\n    of all offences committed against you, and who may be appeased\r\n    by tears and by weeping as He permits Himself to be softened by\r\n    contrition, entreaties, etc., and resumes His natural benignity by\r\n    forgetting things past [etc.].... Alas, what kindness did He use\r\n    toward Adam, His first offender, upon whom through his son Seth He\r\n    poured the oil of pity in five thousand future years, and then to\r\n    Cain the first born of mother He postponed vengeance for his crime\r\n    for ten generations etc. What did he do in Abraham's time, when He\r\n    sent word to Lot that if there were ten righteous men in Sodom and\r\n    Gomorrah He would remit the judgment on the two cities? In Ghent,\"\r\n    etc.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the chancellor's answer to this plea, the duke's consent to grant\r\nforgiveness to Ghent is again compared to God's own mercy. The divine\r\nattributes were referred to again and again, not only on the pages\r\nof contemporaneous chroniclers who may be accused of desiring ducal\r\npatronage, but also in sober state papers.\r\n\r\nThere was one antidote to this homage universally offered to Charles\r\nwherever there was no rebellion against him. One of the rules of the\r\nOrder of the Golden Fleece was that all alike should be subject to\r\ncriticism by their fellows. In May, 1468, at Bruges, Charles held an\r\nassembly of the Order, the first over which he had presided. It was a\r\nfitting opportunity for the knights to express their sentiments. When\r\nit came to his turn to be reviewed, Charles listened quietly to the\r\nrepresentations that his conduct fell short of the ideals of chivalry\r\nbecause he was too economical, too industrious, too strenuous, and not\r\nsufficiently cognisant of the merits of his faithful subjects of high\r\ndegrees.[5]\r\n\r\nIn these plaints, respectful as they are, there is perhaps a note of\r\nregret for the lavish and amusing good cheer of the late duke's times.\r\nCharles was undoubtedly husbanding his resources at this period. The\r\nvision of wide dominions was already in his dreams, and he was prudent\r\nenough to begin his preparations. And prudence is not a popular\r\nquality. Still his courtiers were not quite bereft of the gorgeous and\r\nspectacular entertainments to which the \"good duke\" had accustomed\r\nthem. Soon after the assembly of the Order, the alliance between Duke\r\nCharles and Margaret of York was celebrated at Bruges. Our Burgundian\r\nChastellain is not pleased with this marriage. That Charles inclined\r\ntowards England at all was due to the French king, whom both he and\r\nhis father had found untrustworthy. Again, had there been any other\r\neligible _partie_ in England Charles would never have allied himself\r\nwith King Edward when all his sympathies were with the blood of\r\nLancaster. But when King Louis forsook his cousin Margaret of Anjou,\r\nwhose woes should have commanded pity, simply for the purpose of\r\nundermining the Duke of Burgundy, the latter felt it wise to make\r\nEdward his friend.\r\n\r\n    \"That it was sore against his inclination he confessed to one who\r\n    later revealed it to me, but he decided that it was better to\r\n    injure another rather than be down-trodden and injured himself.[6]\r\n\r\n    \"For a long time there had been little love lost between him and\r\n    the king. The monarch feared the pride and haughtiness of his\r\n    subject, and the subject feared the strength and profound subtilty\r\n    of the king who wanted, he thought, to get him under the whip. And\r\n    all this, alas, was the result of that cursed War of Public Weal\r\n    cooked up by the French against their own king. When Charles was\r\n    deeply involved in it he was deserted by the others and the whole\r\n    weight of the burden fell on his shoulders, so that he alone was\r\n    blamed by the king, and he alone was forced to look to his own\r\n    safety and comfort. It is a pity when such things occur in a realm\r\n    and among kinsfolk.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES, DUKE OF BURGUNDY, PRESIDING OVER A CHAPTER OF\r\nTHE GOLDEN FLEECE\r\n\r\nFROM CONTEMPORANEOUS MINIATURE REPRODUCED IN LENGLET DU FRESNOY\r\nEDITION OF COMINES]\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis was busied with his own affairs in Touraine when news came to\r\nhim that the marriage was to take place immediately. \"If he mourned,\r\nit is not marvellous when I myself mourn it for the future result. But\r\nthe king used all kinds of machinations to break off the alliance....\r\nGod suffered two young proud princes to try their strength each at\r\nhis will, often in ways that would have been incompatible in common\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe fullest account of the wedding is given by La Marche, an\r\neyewitness of the event[7]:\r\n\r\n    \"Gilles du Mas, maître d'hôtel du Duc de Bretagne--to you I\r\n    recommend myself. I have collected here roughly according to my\r\n    stupid understanding what I saw of the said festival, to send it\r\n    to you, beseeching you as earnestly as I can to advise me of the\r\n    noble states and high deeds in your quarter ... as becomes two\r\n    friends of one rank and calling in two fraternal, allied and\r\n    friendly houses.\r\n\r\n    \"My lady and her company arrived at l'Écluse on a Saturday, June\r\n    25th, and on the morrow Madame the Duchess of Burgundy, mother\r\n    of the duke, Mlle. of Burgundy and various other ladies and\r\n    demoiselles visited Madame Margaret[8] and only\r\n\r\nstayed till dinner. The duchess was greatly pleased with her\r\nprospective daughter-in-law and could not say enough of her character\r\nand her virtues. There remained with Dame Margaret, on the part of\r\nthe duchess, the Charnys, Messire Jehan de Rubempré and various other\r\nladies and gentlemen to act the hosts to the strange ladies and\r\ngentlemen who had crossed from England with the bride. The Count and\r\nCountess de Charny met Madame as she disembarked and never budged from\r\nher side until she had arrived at Bruges.\r\n\r\n\"The day after the duchess's visit, Monseigneur of Burgundy made his\r\nway to l'Écluse with a small escort and entered the chateau at the\r\nrear. After supper, accompanied only by six or seven knights of the\r\nOrder, he went very secretly to the hôtel of Dame Margaret, who had\r\nbeen warned of his intention, and was attended by the most important\r\nmembers of her suite, such as the Seigneur d'Escalles, the king's\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n    \"At his arrival when they saw each other the greetings were very\r\n    ceremonious and then the two sat down on one bench and chatted\r\n    comfortably together for some time. After some conversation, the\r\n    Bishop of Salisbury, according to a prearranged plan of his own,\r\n    kneeled before the two and made complimentary speeches. He was\r\n    followed by M. de Charny, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"'Monseigneur, you have found what you desired and since God has\r\n    brought this noble lady to port in safety and to your desire, it\r\n    seems to me that you should not depart without proving the\r\n    affection  you bear her, and that you ought to be betrothed now\r\n    at this moment and give her your troth.'\r\n\r\n    \"Monseigneur answered that it did not depend upon him. Then the\r\n    bishop spoke to Margaret and asked her what she thought. She\r\n    answered that it was just for this and nothing else that the king\r\n    of England had sent her over and she was quite ready to fulfil\r\n    the king's command. Whereupon the bishop took their hands and\r\n    betrothed them. Then Monseigneur departed and returned on the\r\n    morrow to Bruges.\r\n\r\n    \"Dame Margaret remained at l'Écluse until the following Saturday\r\n    and was again visited by Monseigneur. On Saturday the boats were\r\n    richly decorated to conduct my lady to Damme, where she was\r\n    received very honourably according to the capacity of that little\r\n    town. On the morrow, the 3rd of July, Monseigneur the duke set out\r\n    with a small escort between four and five o'clock in the morning,\r\n    and went to Damme, where he found Madame quite ready to receive\r\n    him as all had been prearranged, and Monseigneur wedded her as was\r\n    suitable, and the nuptial benediction was duly pronounced by the\r\n    Bishop of Salisbury. After the mass, Charles returned to his hotel\r\n    at Bruges, and you may believe that during the progress of the\r\n    other ceremonies he slept as if he were to be on watch on the\r\n    following night.\r\n\r\n    \"Immediately after, Adolph of Cleves, John of Luxemburg, John of\r\n    Nassau, and others returned to Damme and paid their homage to the\r\n    new duchess, and then my lady entered a horse litter, beautifully\r\n    draped with cloth of gold. She was clad in white cloth of gold made\r\n    like a wedding garment as was proper. On her hair rested a crown\r\n    and her other jewels were appropriate and sumptuous. Her English\r\n    ladies followed her on thirteen hackneys, two close by her litter\r\n    and the others behind. Five chariots followed the thirteen\r\n    hackneys, the Duchess of Norfolk, the most beautiful woman in\r\n    England, being in the first. In this array Madame proceeded to\r\n    Bruges and entered at the gate called Ste. Croix.\"\r\n\r\nThere were too many names to be enumerated, but La Marche cannot\r\nforbear mentioning a noble Zealander, Adrian of Borselen, Seigneur of\r\nBreda, who had six horses covered with cloth of gold, jewelry, and\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\n    \"I mention him for two reasons [he explains[9]]: first, that he\r\n    was the most brilliant in the procession, and the second is that\r\n    by the will of God he died on the Wednesday from a trouble in his\r\n    leg, which was a pity and much regretted by the nobility.\r\n\r\n    \"The procession from Ste. Croix to the palace was magnificent,\r\n    with all the dignitaries in their order. So costly were the\r\n    dresses of the ducal household that Charles expended more than\r\n    forty thousand francs for cloth of silk and of wool alone.\r\n\r\n    \"Prominent in this stately procession were the nations or foreign\r\n    merchants in this order: Venetians, Florentines--at the head of\r\n    the latter marched Thomas Portinari, banker and councillor of\r\n    the duke at the same time that he was chief of their nation and\r\n    therefore dressed in their garb; Spaniards; Genoese--these latter\r\n    showed a mystery, a beautiful girl on horseback guarded by\r\n    St. George from the dragon.--Then came the Osterlings, 108 on\r\n    horseback, followed by six pages, all clad in violet.\r\n\r\n    \"Gay, too, was Bruges and the streets were all decorated with\r\n    cloth  of gold and silk and tapestries. As to the theatrical\r\n    representations I can remember at least ten. There were Adam and\r\n    Eve, Cleopatra married to King Alexander, and various others.\r\n\r\n    \"The reception at the palace was very formal. The dowager duchess\r\n    herself received her daughter-in-law from the litter and escorted\r\n    her by the hand to her chamber, and for the present we will leave\r\n    the ladies and the knighthood and turn to the arrangement of the\r\n    hôtel.\r\n\r\n    \"In regard to the service, Mme. the new duchess was served\r\n    _d'eschançon et d'escuyer tranchant et de pannetier_. All English,\r\n    all knights and gentlemen of great houses, and the chief steward\r\n    cried 'Knights to table,' and then they went to the buffet to get\r\n    the food, and around the buffet marched all the relations of\r\n    Monseigneur, all the knights of the Order and of great houses. And\r\n    for that day Mme. the duchess the mother declined to be served _à\r\n    couvert_ but left the honour to her daughter-in-law as was right.\r\n\r\n    \"After dinner the ladies retired to their rooms for a little rest\r\n    and there were some changes of dress. Then they all mounted their\r\n    chariots and hackneys and issued forth on the streets in great\r\n    triumph and wonderful were the jousts of the Tree of Gold. Several\r\n    days of festivity followed when the usual pantomimes and shows were\r\n    in evidence.\r\n\r\n    \"Tuesday, the tenth and last day of the fête, the grand _salle_ was\r\n    arranged in the same state as on the wedding day itself, except the\r\n    grand buffet which stood in the middle of the hall. This banquet,\r\n    too, was a grand affair and concluded the festivities.\r\n\r\n    On the morrow, Wednesday, July 15th, Monseigneur departed for\r\n    Holland on a pressing piece of business, and he took leave of the\r\n    Duchess of Norfolk and the other lords and ladies of quality and\r\n    gave them gifts each according to his rank. Thus ends the story\r\n    of this noble festival, and for the present I know nothing worth\r\n    writing you except that I am yours.\"\r\n\r\nTo this may be added the letter of one of the Paston family who was in\r\nMargaret's train.[10]\r\n\r\n    \"John Paston the younger to Margaret Paston:\r\n\r\n    \"To my ryght reverend and worchepfull Modyr Margaret Paston\r\n    dwelling at Caster, be thys delyveryed in hast.\r\n\r\n    \"Ryth reverend & worchepfull Modyr, I recommend me on to you as\r\n    humbylly as I can thynk, desyryng most hertly to her of your\r\n    welfare & hertsese whyche I pray God send you as hastyly as my\r\n    hert can thynk.

Written by the own hand of your brother.\r\n\r\n    \"FRANCIS.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the concluding sentences of a fervent appeal from the\r\nDuke of Brittany that followed Charles into Holland, whither he had\r\nhastened after the completion of the nuptial festivities.\r\n\r\nThe titular Duke of Normandy found that his royal brother was in no\r\nwise inclined to fulfil the solemn pledges made at Conflans. His ally,\r\nFrancis, Duke of Brittany, was plunged into terror lest the king\r\nshould invade his duchy and punish him for his share in the\r\nproceedings that had led up to that compact.\r\n\r\nIt is in this year that Louis XI. begins to show his real astuteness.\r\nVery clever are his methods of freeing himself from the distasteful\r\nobligations assumed towards his brother. They had been easy to make\r\nwhen a hostile army was encamped at the gates of Paris. Then Normandy\r\nweighed lightly when balanced by the desire to separate the allies.\r\nThat separation accomplished, the point of view changed. Relinquish\r\nNormandy, restored by the hand of heaven to its natural liege lord\r\nafter its long retention by the English kings? Louis's intention\r\ngradually became plain and he proved that he was no longer in the\r\nisolated position in which the War for Public Weal had found him. He\r\nhad won to himself many adherents, while the general tone towards\r\nCharles of Burgundy had changed.[1]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1468, the States-General of France assembled at Tours in\r\nresponse to royal writs issued in the preceding February.[2] The\r\nchancellor, Jouvençal, opened the session with a tedious, long-winded\r\nharangue calculated to weary rather than to illuminate the assembly.\r\nThen the king took the floor and delivered a telling speech. With\r\ntrenchant and well chosen phrases he set forth the reasons why\r\nNormandy ought to be an intrinsic part of the French realm. The\r\nadvantages of centralisation, the weakness of decentralisation, were\r\nskilfully drawn. The matter was one affecting the kingdom as a whole,\r\nin perpetuity; it was not for the temporal interests of the present\r\nincumbent of regal authority, who had only part therein for the brief\r\nspace of his mortal journey. Louis's words are pathetic indeed, as\r\nhe calls himself a sojourner in France, _en voyage_ through life,\r\nas though the fact itself of his likeness to the rest of ephemeral\r\nmankind was novel to his audience. He reiterated the statement that\r\nthe interests involved were theirs, not his.\r\n\r\nIt was a goodly body which listened to Louis. The greatest feudal\r\nlords, indeed, were not present, but many of the lesser nobility were,\r\nwhile sixty-four towns sent, all told, about 128 deputies. These\r\nhearers gave willing attention to the thesis that it was a burning\r\nshame for the French people to pay heavy taxes simply to restrain the\r\ninsolent peers from rebelling against their sovereign--those noble\r\nscions of the royal stock whose bounden duty it was to protect the\r\nstate and the head of the royal house.\r\n\r\nWhat was the reason for their selfish insubordination? The root of the\r\nevil lay in the past, when extensive territories had been carelessly\r\nalienated, and their petty over-lords permitted to acquire too much\r\nindependence of the crown, so that the monarchy was threatened with\r\ndisruption. There was more to the same purpose and then the deputies\r\ndeliberated on the answer to make to this speech from the throne. It\r\nwas an answer to Louis's mind, an answer that showed the value of\r\nsuggestion. Charles the Wise had thought that an estate yielding an\r\nincome of twelve thousand livres was all-sufficient for a prince of\r\nthe blood. Louis XI. was more generous. He was ready to allow his\r\nbrother Charles a pension of sixty thousand livres. But as to the\r\ngovernment of Normandy--why! no king, either from fraternal affection\r\nor from fear of war, was justified in committing that province to\r\nother hands than his own.\r\n\r\nThe States-General dissolved in perfect accord with the monarch, and a\r\ndefinite order was left in the king's hands, declaring that it was\r\nthe judgment of the towns represented that concentration of power was\r\nnecessary for the common welfare of France. Public opinion declared\r\nthat national weakness would be inevitable if the feudatories were\r\nunbridled in their centrifugal tendencies. Above all, Normandy must be\r\nretained by the king. On no consideration should Louis leave it to his\r\nbrother.[2]\r\n\r\nBefore the dissolution of the assembly there was some discussion as to\r\nthe probable attitude of the great nobles in regard to this platform\r\nof centralisation. Very timid were the comments on Charles of\r\nBurgundy. Would he not perhaps be an excellent mediator between the\r\nlesser dukes and the king? Would it not be better to suspend action\r\nuntil his opinion was known, etc? But at large there was less reserve.\r\nThe statements were emphatic. Naught but mischief had ever come to\r\nFrance from Burgundy. The present duke's father and grandfather had\r\nwrought all the ill that lay in their power. As for Charles, his\r\nillimitable greed was notorious. Let him rest content with his\r\npaternal heritage. Ghent and Bruges were his. Did he want Paris too?\r\nLet the king recover the towns on the Somme. Rightfully they were\r\nFrench. Louis made no scruple in pleading the invalidity of the treaty\r\nof Conflans, because it had been wrested from him by undue influence.\r\nAnd this royal sentiment was repeated here and there with growing\r\nconviction of its justice.\r\n\r\nWhile Charles was occupied with the preparation for his wedding, Louis\r\nwas engaged in levying troops and mobilising his forces, and these\r\npreparations continued throughout the summer of 1468. Naturally, news\r\nof this zeal directed against the dukes of Normandy and of Brittany\r\nfollowed the traveller in Holland.\r\n\r\nCharles was in high dudgeon and wrote at once to the king, reminding\r\nhim that these seigneurs were his allies, and demanding that nothing\r\nshould be wrought to their detriment. Conscious that his remonstrance\r\nmight be futile, and urged on by appeals from the dukes, Charles\r\nhastened to cut short his stay in Holland so that he might move nearer\r\nto the scene of Louis's activities. His purpose in going to the north\r\nhad been twofold--to receive homage as Count of Holland and Zealand,\r\nand to use his new dignity to obtain large sums of money for which he\r\nsaw immediate need if he were to hold Louis to the terms wrested from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn early July, Charles had crossed from Sluis in Flanders to\r\nMiddelburg, and thence made his progress through the cities of\r\nZealand, receiving homage as he went. Next he passed to The Hague,\r\nwhere the nobles and civic deputies of Holland met him and gave\r\nhim their oaths of fealty on July 21st. Fifty-six towns[4] were\r\nrepresented and there were also deputies from eight bailiwicks and the\r\nislands of Texel and Wieringen. \"It is noteworthy,\" comments a Dutch\r\nhistorian, \"that the people's oath was given first. The older custom\r\nwas that the count should give the first pledge while the people\r\nfollowed suit.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was thus legally invested with sovereign power, Charles\r\ndemanded a large _aide_ from Holland and Zealand--480,000 crowns of\r\nfifteen stivers for himself; 32,000 crowns as pin money for his new\r\nconsort; 16,000 crowns as donations for various servants, and 4800\r\ncrowns towards his travelling expenses. The total sum was 532,800\r\ncrowns. The share of Holland and West Friesland was 372,800 crowns,\r\nand of Zealand 16,000 crowns, to be paid within seven and a half\r\nyears. In Holland, Haarlem paid the heaviest quota, 3549 crowns, and\r\nSchiedam the smallest, 350 crowns, while Dordrecht and the South\r\nHolland villages were assessed at 39,200 crowns, and the remainder was\r\ndivided among the other cities and villages.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable opposition to the assessments. In many cases\r\nthe new imposts upon provisions pressed very heavily on the poor\r\nvillagers. Having obtained promise of the grant, however, Charles left\r\nall further details in its regard to the local officials and returned\r\nto Brussels at the beginning of August to make his own preparation.\r\nFor, by that time, Louis's intentions of evading the treaty of\r\nConflans were plain, though there still fluttered a thin veil of\r\nfriendship between the cousins. Gathering what forces he could\r\nmobilise, ordering them to meet him later, Charles moved westward and\r\ntook up his quarters at Peronne on the river Somme.\r\n\r\nLouis had been bold in his utterance to the States-General as to his\r\nperfect right to ignore the treaty of Conflans, to dispossess his\r\nbrother, and to bring the great feudatories to terms. In the summer\r\nof 1468 he made advances towards accomplishing the last-named\r\ndesideratum. Brittany was invaded by royal troops, but his victory was\r\ndiplomatic rather than military, as Duke Francis peaceably consented\r\nto renounce his close alliances with Burgundy and England, nominally\r\nat least. Further, he agreed to urge Charles of France to submit his\r\nclaims to Normandy to the arbitration of Nicholas of Calabria and the\r\nConstable St. Pol.[5]\r\n\r\nCharles of Burgundy remained to be settled with on some different\r\nbasis. And in regard to him Louis XI. took a resolve which terrified\r\nhis friends and caused the world to wonder as to his sanity. All\r\nprevious attempts at mediation having failed--St. Pol was among the\r\nmany who tried--the king determined to be his own messenger to parley\r\nwith his Burgundian cousin. It is curious how small was his measure\r\nof personal pride. He had been negligent of his personal safety at\r\nConflans, but even then Charles had better reason to respect and\r\nprotect him than in 1468, after Louis had manoeuvred for three years\r\nin every direction to harass and undermine the young duke's power,\r\nand when, too, the latter was aware of half of the machinations and\r\nsuspicious of more.\r\n\r\nYet Louis's famous visit to Peronne was no sudden hare-brained\r\nenterprise. There is much evidence that he nursed the project for many\r\nweeks without giving any intimation of his intentions. Nor was the\r\nsituation as strange as it appears, looking backward.\r\n\r\nCharles had doubtless made all preparations to combat Louis if need\r\nwere, and had chosen Peronne for his headquarters with the express\r\npurpose of being able to watch France, and, at the same time, he had\r\npublished abroad that his military preparations were solely for\r\nthe purpose of keeping his obligations to his allies. Now these\r\nobligations were momentarily removed by the action of those same\r\nallies. Francis of Brittany had entered into amicable relations with\r\nhis sovereign, young Charles of France had accepted arbitration to\r\nsettle the fraternal relations of the royal brothers, while the\r\ncorrespondence between Louis and Liege, was still unknown to the Duke\r\nof Burgundy. For the moment, the latter, therefore, had no definite\r\nquarrel with the French king. But he was not in the least anxious for\r\nan interview with him. Charles was as far as ever from understanding\r\nhis cousin. Even without definite knowledge of Louis's efforts to\r\nmake friends in the Netherlands, Charles suspected enough to turn his\r\nyouthful distrust of the man's character into mature conviction that\r\nfriendship between them was impossible. But he could not refuse the\r\nroyal overtures. His letter of safe-conduct to his self-invited\r\nvisitor bears the date of October 8th, and runs as follows:[6]\r\n\r\n    \"MONSEIGNEUR:\r\n\r\n    \"I commend myself to your good graces. Sire, if it be your\r\n    desire to come to this city of Peronne in order that we may talk\r\n    together, I swear and I promise you by my faith and on my honour\r\n    that you may come, remain and return in safety to Chauny or Noyon,\r\n    according to your pleasure and as often as it shall please you,\r\n    freely and openly without any hindrance offered either to you or\r\n    to any of your people by me or by any other for any cause that now\r\n    exists or _that may hereafter arise_.\"\r\n\r\nGuillaume de Biche acted as confidential messenger between duke and\r\nking. He it was whom Charles had dismissed from his own service in\r\n1456 at his father's instance. From that time on the man had been in\r\nLouis's household, deep in his secrets it was said, and certainly\r\nadmitted to his privacy to an extraordinary degree. This letter was\r\nwritten by Charles in the presence of Biche, through whose hand it\r\npassed directly to the king.\r\n\r\nBy October, Louis was at Ham, prepared to move as soon as the\r\nsafe-conduct arrived. No time was lost after its receipt. On Sunday,\r\nOctober 9th, the king started out, accompanied by the Bishop of\r\nAvranches, his confessor, by the Duke of Bourbon, Cardinal Balue,\r\nSt. Pol, a few more nobles, and about eighty archers of the Scottish\r\nguard. As he rode towards Peronne, Philip of Crèvecoeur, with two\r\nhundred lances, met him on the way to act as his escort to the\r\npresence of the duke, who awaited his guest on the banks of a stream a\r\nshort distance out of Peronne.\r\n\r\nSt. Pol was the first of the royal party to meet the duke as herald of\r\nLouis's approach. Then Charles rode forward to greet the traveller. As\r\nhe came within sight of his cousin, he bowed low to his saddle and was\r\nabout to dismount when Louis, his head bared, prevented his action.\r\nFervent were the kisses pressed by the kingly lips upon the duke's\r\ncheeks, while Louis's arm rested lovingly about the latter's neck.\r\nThen he turned graciously to the by-standing nobles and greeted them\r\nby name. But his cousinly affection was not yet satisfied. Again he\r\nembraced Charles and held him half as long as before in his arms. How\r\npleasant he was and how full of confidence towards this trusted cousin\r\nof his!\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade fell into line again, with the two princes in the\r\nmiddle, and made a stately entry into Peronne at a little after\r\nmid-day.[7] The chief building then and the natural place to lodge\r\na royal visitor was the castle. But it was in sorry repair, ill\r\nfurnished, and affording less comfort than a neighbouring house\r\nbelonging to a city official. Here rooms had been prepared for the\r\nking and a few of his suite, the others being quartered through the\r\ntown. At the door Charles took his leave and Louis entered alone with\r\nCardinal Balue and the attendants he had chosen to keep near him.\r\nThese latter were nearly all of inferior birth, and were treated\r\nby their master with a familiarity very astonishing to the stately\r\nBurgundians.\r\n\r\nLouis entered the room assigned for his use, walked to the window,\r\nand looked out into the street. The sight that met his view was most\r\ndisquieting. A party of cavaliers were on the point of entering the\r\ncastle. They were gentlemen just arrived from Burgundy with their\r\nlances, in response to a summons issued long before the present visit\r\nwas anticipated. As he looked down on the troops, Louis recognised\r\nseveral men who had no cause to love him or to cherish his memory.\r\nThere was, for instance, the queen's brother Philip de Bresse[8] who\r\nhad led a party against Louis's own sister Yolande of Savoy. At a\r\ntime of parley this Philip had trusted the sincerity of his\r\nbrother-in-law's profession and had visited him to obtain his\r\nmediation. The king had violated both the specified safe-conduct and\r\nambassadorial equity alike, and had thrown De Bresse into the citadel\r\nof Loches, where he suffered a long confinement before he succeeded in\r\nmaking his escape. He was a Burgundian in sympathy as well as in race.\r\nBut with him on that October day Louis noticed various Frenchmen who\r\nhad fallen under royal displeasure from one cause or another and had\r\nsaved their liberty by flight, renouncing their allegiance to him\r\nfor ever. Four there were in all who wore the cross of St. Andrew.\r\nApproaching Peronne as they had from the south, these new-comers had\r\nridden in at the southern gates without intimation of this royal\r\nvisitation extraordinary until they were almost face to face with\r\nguest and host. Their arrival was \"a half of a quarter of an hour\r\nlater than that of the king.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Philip de Bresse and his friends learned what was going on, they\r\nhastened to the duke's chambers \"to give him reverence.\" Monseigneur\r\nde Bresse was the spokesman in begging the duke that the three above\r\nnamed should be assured of their security notwithstanding the king's\r\npresence at Peronne,--of security such as he had pledged them in\r\nBurgundy and promised for the hour when they should arrive at his\r\ncourt. On their part they were ready to serve him towards all and\r\nagainst all. Which petition the duke granted orally. \"The force\r\nconducted by the Marshal of Burgundy was encamped without the gates,\r\nand the said marshal spoke no ill of the king, nor did the others I\r\nhave mentioned.\"[9]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, a situation in which apprehension was not confined\r\nto the men of lower station. To Louis, looking down from his window,\r\nthere seemed dire menace in the mere presence of these persons who had\r\nheavy grievances against him, and the unfortified private house seemed\r\nslight protection against their possible vengeance. Here, Charles\r\nmight disavow injury to him as something happening quite without his\r\nknowledge. On ducal soil the safest place was assuredly under shelter\r\npatently ducal. There, there would be no doubt of responsibility did\r\nmisfortune happen.\r\n\r\nStraightway the king sent a messenger to Charles asking for quarters\r\nwithin the castle. The request was granted and the uneasy guest passed\r\nthrough the massive portals between a double line of Burgundian\r\nmen-at-arms. It was no cheerful, pleasant, palatial dwelling-place\r\nthis little old castle of Peronne. So thick were the walls that vain\r\nhad been all assaults against it.[10] Designed for a fortress rather\r\nthan a residence, it had been repeatedly used as a prison, and the air\r\nof the whole was tainted by the dungeons under its walls, dungeons\r\nwhich had seen many unwilling lodgers. Five centuries earlier than\r\nthis date, Charles the Simple had languished to death in one of the\r\ntowers.\r\n\r\nThis change of arrangement, or rather the disquieting reason for the\r\nchange, undoubtedly clouded the peacefulness of the occasion. Yet\r\noutward calm was preserved. Commines asserts that the two princes\r\ndirected their people to behave amicably to each other and that the\r\ncommands were scrupulously obeyed. For two or three days the desired\r\nconferences took place between Charles and Louis. The king's wishes\r\nwere perfectly plain. He wanted Charles to forsake all other alliances\r\nand to pledge himself to support his feudal chief, first and foremost,\r\nfrom all attacks of his enemies. The Duke of Brittany had submitted\r\nto his liege. If the Duke of Burgundy would only accept terms equally\r\nsatisfactory in their way, the pernicious alliance between the two\r\nwould vanish, to the weal of French unity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP DE COMMINES.]\r\n\r\nApparently the first discussion was heard by none except the Cardinal\r\nBalue and Guillaume de Biche. Charles was willing to pledge allegiance\r\nand to promise aid to his feudal chief, but under limitations that\r\nweakened the value of his words. Nothing could induce him to renounce\r\nalliance with other princes for mutual aid, did they need it. There\r\nwas a second interview on the following day. Charles held tenaciously\r\nto his position. Then there came a sudden alteration in the situation,\r\na strange dramatic shifting of the duke's point of view.\r\n\r\nThe city of Liege had submitted perforce to the behests of her\r\nimperious neighbour, but the citizens had never ceased to hope that\r\nhis unwelcome \"protection\" might be dispensed with; that, by the aid\r\nof French troops, they might eventually wrest themselves free from\r\nthe Burgundian incubus. In spite of all promises to Charles, secret\r\nnegotiations between the anti-Burgundian party and Louis XI. had never\r\nceased. The latter never refused to admit the importunate embassies to\r\nhis presence. He was glad to keep in touch with the city even in\r\nits ruined condition. He sent envoys as well as received them, and\r\nCommines states definitely that, in making his plan to visit Peronne,\r\nthe fact of a confidential commission recently despatched to Liege had\r\nwholly slipped the king's mind.\r\n\r\nIn that town the duke's lieutenant, Humbercourt, had been left to\r\nsupervise the humiliating changes ordered. And the work of demolition\r\nwas the only industry. Other ordinary business was at a standstill.\r\nFor a period there was a sullen silence in the streets and the church\r\nbells were at rest. In April, a special legate from the pope arrived\r\nto see whether ecclesiastical affairs could not be put on a better\r\nfooting.\r\n\r\nIt was about the same time that the States-General were meeting\r\nat Tours that, under the direction of this legate, Onofrio de\r\nSanta-Croce, the cathedral was purified with holy water, and Louis of\r\nBourbon celebrated his very first mass, though he had been seated on\r\nthe episcopal throne for twelve years. Then Onofrio tried to mediate\r\nbetween the city and the Duke of Burgundy. To Bruges he went to\r\nsee Charles, and obtained permission to draft a project for the\r\nre-establishment of the civic government, to be submitted to the duke\r\nfor approval.\r\n\r\nIf Onofrio thought he had reformed the bishop by forcing him into\r\nperforming his priestly rites he soon learned his mistake. That\r\necclesiastic speedily disgusted his flock by his ill-timed\r\nfestivities, and then forsook the city and sailed away to Maestricht\r\nin a gaily painted barge, with gay companions to pass the summer in\r\nfrivolous amusements suited to his dissolute tastes. Such was the\r\nstate of affairs when the report of Louis's extensive military\r\npreparations encouraged the Liegeois to hope that he was to take the\r\nfield openly against the duke.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of September, troops of forlorn and desperate\r\nexiles began to return to the city. They came, to be sure, with shouts\r\nof _Vive le Roi!_ but, as a matter of fact, they seemed willing to\r\nmake any accommodation for the sake of being permitted to remain.\r\n\"Better any fate at home than to live like wild beasts with the\r\nrecollection that we had once been men.\"\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, Onofrio again endeavoured to rouse the\r\nbishop to a sense of his duty. Again he tried to make terms for the\r\nexiles and to re-establish a tenable condition. It was useless. Louis\r\nof Bourbon refused to approach nearer to Liege than Tongres, and\r\ndeclined to meet the advances of his despairing subjects. It was just\r\nat this moment that fresh emissaries arrived from Louis, despatched,\r\nas already stated, _before_ Charles had consented to prolong the\r\ntruce.\r\n\r\nExcited by their presence the Liegeois once more roused themselves to\r\naction. A force of two thousand was gathered at Liege, and advanced by\r\nnight upon Tongres--also without walls--surrounded the house where lay\r\ntheir bishop, and forced him to return to Liege. Violence there was\r\nand loss of life, but, as a matter of fact, the mob respected the\r\nperson of their bishop and of Humbercourt the chief Burgundian\r\nofficial. This event happened on October 9th, the very day that Louis\r\nrode recklessly into Peronne.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, October 11th, the news of the fray reached Peronne,\r\nbut news greatly exaggerated by rumour. Bishop, papal legate, and\r\nBurgundian lieutenant all had been ruthlessly murdered in the very\r\npresence of Louis's own envoys, who had aided and abetted the hideous\r\ncrime! To follow the story of an eyewitness:[11]\r\n\r\n    \"Some said that everyone was dead, others asserted the contrary,\r\n    for such advertisments are never reported after one sort. At\r\n    length others came who had seen certain canons slain and supposed\r\n    the bishop[12] to be of the number, as well as the said seigneur\r\n    de Humbercourt and all the rest. Further, they said that they had\r\n    seen the king's ambassadors in the attacking company and mentioned\r\n    them by name. All this was repeated to the duke, who forthwith\r\n    believed it and fell into an extreme fury, saying that the king\r\n    had come thither to abuse him, and gave commands to shut the gates\r\n    of the castle and of the town, alleging a poor enough excuse,\r\n    namely, that he did this on account of the disappearance of a\r\n    little casket containing some good rings and money.\r\n\r\n    \"The king finding himself confined in the castle, a small one at\r\n    that, and having seen a force of archers standing before the gate,\r\n    was terrified for his person--the more so that he was lodged in\r\n    the neighbourhood of a tower where a certain Count de Vermandois\r\n    had caused the death of one of his predecessors as king of\r\n    France.[13] At that time, I was still with the duke and served him\r\n    as chamberlain, and had free access to his chamber when I\r\n    would, for such was the usage in this household.\r\n\r\n    \"The said duke, as soon as he saw the gates closed, ordered all to\r\n    leave his presence and said to a few of us that stayed with him\r\n    that the king had come on purpose to betray him, and that he\r\n    himself had tried to avoid his coming with all his strength, and\r\n    that the meeting had been against his taste. Then he proceeded to\r\n    recount the news from Liege, how the king had pulled all the wires\r\n    through his ambassadors, and how his people had been slain. He was\r\n    fearfully excited against the king. I veritably believe that if\r\n    at that hour he had found those to whom he could appeal ready to\r\n    sympathise with him and to advise him to work the king some\r\n    mischief, he would have done so, at the least he would have\r\n    imprisoned him in the great tower.\r\n\r\n    \"None were present when the words fell from the duke but myself\r\n    and two grooms of the chamber, one of whom was named Charles de\r\n    Visen, a native of Dijon, an honest fellow, in good credit with\r\n    his master. We aggravated nothing, but sought to appease the duke\r\n    as much as in us lay. Soon he tried the same phrases on others,\r\n    and a report of them ran through the city and penetrated to the\r\n    very apartment of the king, who was greatly terrified, as was\r\n    everyone, because of the danger that they saw imminent, and\r\n    because of the great difficulty in soothing a quarrel when it\r\n    has commenced between such great princes. Assuredly they were\r\n    blameworthy in failing to notify their absent servants of this\r\n    projected meeting. Great inconveniences were bound to arise from\r\n    this negligence.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is Commines's narrative. Eyewitness though he was, it must be\r\nremembered that when he wrote the account of this famous interview it\r\nwas long after the event, and when his point of view was necessarily\r\ncoloured by his service with Louis. Delightful, however, are the\r\nhistorian's own reflections that he intersperses with his plain\r\nnarrative. To his mind the only period when it is safe for princes to\r\nmeet is\r\n\r\n    \"in their youth when their minds are bent on pleasure. Then they\r\n    may amuse themselves together. But after they are come to man's\r\n    estate and are desirous each of over-reaching the other, such\r\n    interviews do but increase their mutual hatred, even if they incur\r\n    no personal peril (which is well-nigh impossible). Far wiser is\r\n    it for them to adjust their differences through sage and good\r\n    servants as I have said at length elsewhere in these memoirs.\"\r\n\r\nThen our chronicler proceeds to give numerous instances of disastrous\r\nroyal interviews before returning to his subject and to Peronne:\r\n\r\n    \"I was moved [he adds again at the beginning of his new chapter]\r\n    to tell the princes my opinion of such meetings.[14] Thus the\r\n    gates were closed and guarded and two or three days passed by.\r\n    However, the Duke of Burgundy would not see the king, nor had\r\n    Louis's servants entry to the castle except a few, and those only\r\n    through the wicket. Nor did the duke see any of his people who had\r\n    influence over him.\r\n\r\n    \"The first day there was consternation throughout the city. By the\r\n    second day the duke was a little calmed down. He held a council\r\n    meeting all day and the greater part of the night. The king\r\n    appealed to every one who could possibly aid him. He was lavish in\r\n    his promises and ordered fifteen thousand crowns to be given where\r\n    it might count, but the officer in charge of the disbursement of\r\n    this sum acquitted himself ill and retained a part, as the king\r\n    learned later.\r\n\r\n    \"The king was especially afraid of his former servants who had\r\n    come with the army from Burgundy, as I mentioned above, men who\r\n    were now in the service of the Duke of Normandy.\r\n\r\n    \"Diverse were the opinions in the above-mentioned council-meeting.\r\n    Some held that the safe-conduct accorded to the king protected\r\n    him, seeing that he fairly observed the peace as it had been\r\n    stated in writing. Others rudely urged his capture without further\r\n    ceremony, while others again advised sending for his brother, the\r\n    Duke of Normandy, and concluding with him a peace to the advantage\r\n    of all the princes of France. They who gave this advice thought\r\n    that in case it was adopted, the king should be restrained of his\r\n    liberty. Further, it was against all precedent to free so great a\r\n    seigneur when he had committed so grave an offence.\r\n\r\n    \"This last argument so nearly prevailed that I saw a man booted\r\n    and spurred ready to depart with a packet of letters addressed to\r\n    Monseigneur of Normandy, being in Brittany, and stayed only for\r\n    the Duke of Burgundy's letter. However, this came to naught. The\r\n    king made overtures to leave as hostages the Duke of Bourbon, the\r\n    cardinal, his brother, and the constable with a dozen others while\r\n    he should be permitted to return to Compiegne after peace was\r\n    concluded. He promised that the Liegeois should repair their\r\n    mischief or he would declare himself their foe. The appointed\r\n    hostages were profuse in their offers to immolate themselves, at\r\n    least they were in public. I do not know whether they would have\r\n    said the same things in private. I rather suspect not. And in\r\n    truth, I believe that those who were left would never have\r\n    returned.\r\n\r\n    \"On the third night after the arrival of the news, the duke never\r\n    undressed, but lay down two or three times on his bed, and\r\n    then rose and walked up and down. Such was his way when he was\r\n    troubled. I lay that night in his chamber and talked with him from\r\n    time to time. In the morning his fury was greater than ever, his\r\n    tone very menacing, and he seemed ready to go to any extreme.\r\n\r\n    \"However, he finally brought himself to say that if the king would\r\n    swear the peace and would accompany him to Liege to help avenge\r\n    Monsgn. of Liege, his own kinsman, he would be satisfied. Then\r\n    he suddenly betook himself to the king's chamber and expressed\r\n    himself to that effect. The king had a friend[15] who warned him,\r\n    assuring him that he should suffer no ill if he would concede\r\n    these two points. Did he do otherwise he ran grave risk, graver\r\n    than he would ever incur again.\"\r\n\r\n    When the duke entered the royal presence his voice trembled, so\r\n    agitated was he and on the verge of breaking into a passion. He\r\n    assumed a reverential attitude, but rough were mien and word as he\r\n    demanded whether the king would keep the treaty of peace as it had\r\n    been drafted, and whether he was ready to swear to it. \"Yes\" was\r\n    the king's response. In truth, nothing had been added to the\r\n    agreement made before Paris, or at least little as far as the Duke\r\n    of Burgundy was concerned. As regarded the Duke of Normandy, it\r\n    was stipulated that if he would renounce that province he should\r\n    have Champagne and Brie besides other neighbouring territories for\r\n    his share.\r\n\r\n    Then the duke asked if the king would accompany him to avenge the\r\n    outrage committed upon his cousin the bishop.\r\n\r\n    \"To which demand the king gave assent as soon as the peace was\r\n    sworn. He was quite satisfied to go to Liege and with a small or\r\n    large escort, just as the duke preferred. This answer pleased\r\n    the duke immensely. In was brought the treaty, out of the king's\r\n    coffer was taken the piece of the true cross, the very one carried\r\n    by Saint Charlemagne, called the Cross of Victory, and thereupon\r\n    the two swore the peace.\r\n\r\n    \"This was now October 14th. In a minute the bells pealed out their\r\n    joy throughout Peronne and all men were glad. It hath pleased the\r\n    king since to attribute the credit of this pacification to me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was undoubtedly an immense sense of relief in Peronne when this\r\ndegree of accommodation was reached. The duke was unwilling, however,\r\nto have too much rejoicing in his domains until he had ascertained for\r\nhimself the state of Liege. Among the letters despatched from Peronne\r\nthis October 14th, was the following to the magistrates of Ypres:[16]\r\n\r\n    \"Dear and well beloved friends, considering that we have to-day\r\n    made peace and convention with Monseigneur the king, and that for\r\n    this reason you might be inclined to let off fire-works and make\r\n    other manifestations of joy, we hasten to advise you that ... our\r\n    pleasure is you shall not permit fireworks or assemblies in our\r\n    town of Ypres on account of the said peace until we have subdued\r\n    the people of Liege, and avenged the said outrage [described\r\n    above]. This with God's aid we intend to do. We are on the point\r\n    of departure with all our forces for Liege. Beloved, may our Lord\r\n    protect you.\r\n\r\n    \"Written in our castle of Peronne, October 14, 1468.\"\r\n\r\nA certain G. Ruple conveyed his own impressions to the magistrates of\r\nYpres, possibly managing to slip them under the same cover.[17]\r\n\r\n    \"To-day, at about 10 o'clock, peace was concluded between the king\r\n    and Monseigneur, and also between the king and the Duke of Berry.\r\n    Here, bells are ringing and the _Te Deum_ is sung. It is generally\r\n    believed that Monseigneur will depart to-morrow. God deserves\r\n    thanks for the result, for I assure you that last night the\r\n    outlook was not clear.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe king wrote as follows to his confidential lieutenant:\r\n\r\n    \"PERONNE, October 14th.\r\n\r\n    \"Monseigneur the grand master, you are already informed how there\r\n    has been discussion in my council and that of my brother-in-law of\r\n    Burgundy, as to the best manner of adjusting certain differences\r\n    between him and me. It went so far that in order to arrive at a\r\n    conclusion I came to this town of Peronne. Here we have busied\r\n    ourselves with the requisitions passing between us, so that to-day\r\n    we have, thanks to our Lord, in the presence of all the nobles\r\n    of the blood, prelates and other great and notable personages in\r\n    great numbers, both from my suite and from his, sworn peace\r\n    solemnly on the true cross, and promised to aid, defend and\r\n    succour each other for ever. Also on the same cross we have\r\n    ratified the treaty of Arras with its corrections and other points\r\n    which seemed productive of peace and amity.\r\n\r\n    \"Immediately after this the Duke of Burgundy ordered thanksgivings\r\n    in the churches of his lands, and in this town he has already had\r\n    great solemnity. And because my brother of Burgundy has heard that\r\n    the Liegeois have taken prisoner my cousin the bishop of Liege,\r\n    whom he is determined to deliver as quickly as possible, he has\r\n    besought me as a favour to him, and also because the bishop is my\r\n    kinsman whom I ought to aid, to accompany him to Liege, not far\r\n    from here. This I have agreed to, and have chosen as my escort\r\n    a portion of the troops under monseigneur the constable, in the\r\n    hopes of a speedy return by the aid of God.\r\n\r\n    \"And because it is for my weal and that of my subjects I write to\r\n    you at once, because _I am sure_ you will be pleased, and that\r\n    you will order like solemnities. Moreover, monseigneur the grand\r\n    master, as I lately wrote to you, pray as quickly as possible\r\n    disband my _arriere ban_ together with the free lances, and\r\n    do every possible thing for the mass of poor folks; appoint\r\n    well-to-do men as leaders in every bailiwick and district. Above\r\n    all, see to it that they do not indulge in any new and startling\r\n    conduct. That done, if you wish to come to Bohan, to be nearer\r\n    me, I would be glad, so as to be able to provide for any further\r\n    action that may arise. Written at Peronne October 14th.\r\n\r\n    \"Loys MEURIN.\r\n\r\n    \"To our dear and beloved cousin the Count of Dammartin, grand\r\n    master of France.\"[19]\r\n\r\nDammartin thought that this letter was phrased for the purpose of\r\npassing Charles's censorship. He took the liberty of disregarding his\r\nmaster's orders; the troops were not disbanded, and he held himself\r\nin readiness to go to fetch the errant monarch if he did not return\r\nspeedily from the enemy's country. His letter to the king and the\r\nunwritten additions delivered by his confidential messengers terrified\r\nhis liege lest too much zeal on his behalf in France might work him\r\nill in Liege. A week later Louis writes again:\r\n\r\n    NAMUR, Oct. 22nd.\r\n\r\n    \"MONSEIGNEUR THE GRAND MASTER:\r\n\r\n    \"I have received your letter by Sire du Bouchage. _Be assured that\r\n    I make this journey to Liege under no constraint, and that I never\r\n    took any journey with such good heart as I do this._ Since God and\r\n    Our Lady have given me grace to be friends with Monseigneur of\r\n    Burgundy, be sure that never shall our rabble over there take arms\r\n    against me. Monseigneur the grand master, my friend, you have\r\n    proved that you love me, and you have done me the greatest service\r\n    that you can, and there is another service that you can do. The\r\n    people of Monseigneur of Burgundy think that I mean to deceive\r\n    them, and people there [in France] think that I am a prisoner.\r\n    Distrust between the two would be my ruin.\r\n\r\n    \"Monseigneur, as to the quarters of your men, you know what we\r\n    planned, you and I, touching the action of Armagnac. It seems\r\n    to me that you ought to send your people straight ahead in that\r\n    direction and I will furnish you four or five captains as soon as\r\n    I am out of this, and you can make what choice you will. M. the\r\n    grand master, my friend, come, I beg you, to Laon and await me\r\n    there. Send me a messenger the minute you arrive and I will let\r\n    you have frequent news. Be assured that as soon as the Liegeois\r\n    are subdued, on the morrow I will depart, for Monsg. of Burgundy\r\n    is resolved to urge me to go as soon as he has finished his work\r\n    at Liege, and he desires my return more than I do. Francois Dunois\r\n    will tell you what good cheer we are making. Adieu, monseigneur,\r\n    etc.\r\n\r\n    \"Writ at Namur, Oct. 22nd.\r\n\r\n    \"LOUIS \"TOUSSAINT.\r\n\r\n    \"To our dear and beloved cousin the Count of Dammartin, grand\r\n    master of France.\"[20]\r\n\r\nLetters of the same date to Rochefoucauld and others also declare that\r\nLouis goes most gladly with his dear brother of Burgundy and that the\r\naffair will not require much time. To Cardinal Balue he writes only a\r\nfew words, telling him that the messenger will be more communicative.\r\n\r\nBetween Peronne and Namur did the party turn aside to visit the\r\nyoung Duchess of Burgundy, either at Hesdin or at Aire? Such is the\r\nconjecture of a learned Belgian editor, and he carries his surmise\r\nfurther in suggesting that in this brief sojourn was performed\r\nChastellain's mystery of \"The Peace of Peronne.\"[21] Perhaps these\r\nverses, if put in the mouths of Louis and Charles, may have pleased\r\nthe princely spectators of the dramatic poem. Mutual admiration was\r\nthe key-note of these flowery speeches while the other _dramatis\r\npersonæ_ expressed unstinted admiration for the wonderful deed\r\naccomplished by these two pure souls who have sworn peace when they\r\nmight have brought dire war on their innocent subjects.\r\n\r\n    \"Never did David, nor Ogier, nor Roland, that proud knight,\r\n    nor the great Charlemagne, nor the proud Duke of Mayence, nor\r\n    Mongleive, the heir, from whom issued noble fruit, nor King\r\n    Arthur, nor Oliver, nor Rossillon, nor Charbonnier in their dozens\r\n    of victories approach or touch with hand or foot the work I treat\r\n    of.\"\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    [The king speaks.]\r\n\r\n    \"Charles, be assured that Louis will be the re-establisher and\r\n    provider of all that touches your honour and peace between you\r\n    and him. That he will ever be appreciator of you and avenger, a\r\n    nourisher of joy and love in repairing all that my predecessor\r\n    did.\r\n\r\n    [The duke speaks.]\r\n\r\n    \"And Charles, who loves his honour as much as his soul, wishes\r\n    nothing better than to serve you and this realm and to extol\r\n    your house. For I know that is the reason why I have glory and\r\n    reputation. Then if it please God and Our Lady, my body will keep\r\n    from blame.\"\r\n\r\nOne stanza, indeed, uttered by Louis strikes a note of doubt:\r\n\"Charles, so many debates may occur, so many incidents and accidents\r\nin our various actions, that a rupture may be dreaded.\"\r\n\r\nVehemently did the duke repudiate the bare possibility of a new breach\r\nbetween him and his liege. The whole is a pæan at a love feast. If the\r\ntwo together heard their counterfeits express such perfect fidelity,\r\nhow Louis XI. must have laughed to himself behind his mask of forced\r\ncourtesy! Charles, on the other hand, was quite capable of taking it\r\nall seriously, wholly unconscious that he had not cut the lion's claws\r\nfor once and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _See_ Lavisse iv^{ii}.,356.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The letters of convocation bear the date February 26,\r\n1467, o.s.

It would\r\nhardly seem possible for journey and visit in so brief a time.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EASY VICTORY\r\n\r\n1468\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of heavy rains that the journey was made to Namur\r\nand then on to the environs of Liege. Grim was the weather, befitting,\r\nin all probability, Charles's own mood. The king's escort was confined\r\nto very few besides the Scottish guard, but a body of three hundred\r\ntroopers was permitted to follow him at a distance, while the faithful\r\nDammartin across the border kept himself closely informed of every\r\nincident connected with the march that his scouts could gather, and\r\nin readiness to fall upon Burgundian possessions at a word of alarm,\r\nwhile he restrained his ardour for the moment in obedience to Louis's\r\nanxious command.\r\n\r\nBy the fourth week of October the Franco-Burgundian party were settled\r\nclose to Liege in straggling camps, separated from each other by hills\r\nand uneven ground. Long was the discussion in council meeting as to\r\nthe best mode of procedure. Liege was absolutely helpless in the face\r\nof this coalition. Wide breaches made her walls useless. Moats she had\r\nnever possessed, for digging was well-nigh impossible on her rocky\r\nsite covered by mud and slime from the overflow of the Meuse. On\r\naccount of this evident weakness, the king advised dismissing half the\r\narmy as needless, advice that was not only rejected immediately but\r\nwhich excited Charles's doubts of the king's good faith. Over a week\r\npassed and feeble Liege continued obstinate, while each division of\r\nthe army manoeuvred to be first in the assault for the sake of the\r\nplunder. But advance was very difficult, for the soldiers were\r\nimpeded in their movements by the slime. Wild were some of the night\r\nskirmishes over the uneven, slippery ground and amidst the little\r\nsheltering hills.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, \"a great many were hurt and among the rest the Prince\r\nof Orange (whom I had forgotten to name before), who behaved that day\r\nlike a courageous gentleman, for he never moved foot off the place he\r\nfirst possessed.\r\n\r\nThe duke, too, did not lack in courage but he failed sometimes\r\nin order giving, and to say the truth, he behaved himself not so\r\nadvisedly as many wished because of the king's presence.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Charles entertained increasingly sinister\r\nsuspicions of his guest. He thought the king might either try to enter\r\nthe city ahead of him and manage to placate his ancient allies by a\r\nspecious explanation, or else he might succeed in effecting his escape\r\nwithout fulfilling his compact. At last Charles appointed Sunday,\r\nOctober 30th, for an assault. On the 29th, his own quarters were in\r\na little suburb of mean, low houses, with rough ground and vineyards\r\nseparating his camp from the city. Between his house and that of the\r\nking, both humble dwellings, was an old granary, occupied by a picked\r\nBurgundian force of three hundred men under special injunctions to\r\nkeep close watch over the royal guest and see that he played no sudden\r\ntrick. To further this purpose of espionage, they had made a breach in\r\nthe walls with heavy blows of their picks.\r\n\r\nThe men were wearied with all their marching and skirmishing, and in\r\norder to have them in fighting trim on the morrow, Charles had ordered\r\nall alike to turn in and refresh themselves. The exhausted troops\r\ngladly obeyed this injunction. Charles was disarmed and sleeping, so,\r\ntoo, were Philip de Commines and the few attendants that lay within\r\nthe narrow ducal chamber. Only a dozen pickets mounted guard in the\r\nroom over Charles's little apartment, and kept their tired eyes open\r\nby playing at dice.\r\n\r\nOn that Saturday night when Charles was thus prudently gathering\r\nstrength for the final tussle, the people of Liege also indulged in\r\nrepose, counting on Sunday being a day of rest, that is, the major\r\npart of the burgher folk did within city limits. But another plan was\r\non foot among some of the inhabitants of an outlying region. An attack\r\non the Burgundian camp was planned by a band from Franchimont, a wild\r\nand wooded district, south of the episcopal see. The natives there had\r\nall the characteristics of mountaineers, although the heights of their\r\nrugged country reached only modest altitudes.[2]\r\n\r\nThese invaders were fortunate in obtaining as guides the owners of\r\nthe very houses requisitioned for the lodgings of the two princes.\r\nStraight to their goal they progressed through paths quite unknown to\r\nthe foe, and therefore unwatched. The highlanders made a mistake\r\nin not rushing headlong to the royal lodgings, where in the first\r\nconfusion they might have accomplished their design upon the lives of\r\nLouis and of Charles or at least have taken the two prisoners. But a\r\npause at a French nobleman's tent created a disturbance which roused\r\nthe archers in the granary. The latter sallied out, to meet with a\r\nfierce counter-attack. In order to confuse them the mountaineers\r\nechoed the Burgundian cries, _Vive Bourgogne, vive le roy et tuez,\r\ntuez_, and they were not always immediately identified by their harsh\r\nLiege accent.\r\n\r\nThe highlanders were far outnumbered by the Burgundians, and it was\r\nonly by dint of their desperate courage and by reason of the pitchy\r\ndarkness and of the locality with its unknown roughness that the\r\nformer inflicted the damage that they did.\r\n\r\nCommines and his fellows helped the duke into his cuirass, and stood\r\nby his person, while the king's bodyguard of Scottish archers \"proved\r\nthemselves good fellows, who never budged from their master's feet and\r\nshot arrow upon arrow out into the darkness, wounding more Burgundians\r\nthan Liegeois.\" The first to fall was Charles's own host, the guide of\r\nthe marauders to his own cottage door. There were many more victims\r\nand no mercy. It was, indeed, an encounter characterised by the\r\npassions of war and the conditions of a mere burglarious attack on\r\nprivate houses.\r\n\r\nQuaking with fear was the king. He thought that if the duke should now\r\nfail to make a complete conquest of Liege, his own fate would hang in\r\nthe balance. At a hasty council meeting held that night, Charles\r\nwas very doubtful as to the expediency of carrying out his proposed\r\nassault upon the city. Very distrustful of each other were the allies,\r\na fact that caused Philip de Commines to comment,[3] \"scarcely fifteen\r\ndays had elapsed since these two had sworn a definitive peace and\r\nsolemnly promised to support each other loyally. But confidence could\r\nnot enter in any way.\"\r\n\r\nCharles gave Louis permission to retire to Namur and wait until the\r\nduke had reduced the recalcitrant burghers once for all. Louis thought\r\nit wiser to keep close to Charles's own person until they parted\r\ncompany for ever, and the morrow found him in the duke's company as he\r\nmarched on to Liege.\r\n\r\n    \"My opinion is, [says Commines], that he would have been wise to\r\n    depart that night. He could have done it for he had a hundred\r\n    archers of his guard, various gentlemen of his household, and,\r\n    near at hand, three hundred men-at-arms. Doubtless he was stayed\r\n    by considerations of honour. He did not wish to be accused of\r\n    cowardice.\"\r\n\r\nOlivier de la Marche, also present as the princely pair entered Liege,\r\nheard the king say: \"March on, my brother, for you are the luckiest\r\nprince alive.\" As they entered the gates, Louis shouted lustily,\r\n\"_Vive Bourgogne_,\" to the infinite dismay of his former friends, the\r\nburghers of Liege.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the history of that dire Sunday morning differs from\r\nthat of other assaults only in harrowing details, and the extremity of\r\nthe pitilessness and ferocity manifested by the conquerors. Charles\r\nhad previously spared churches, and protected the helpless. Above\r\nall he had severely punished all ill treatment of respectable women.\r\nLittle trace of this former restraint was to be seen on this occasion.\r\nThe inhabitants were destroyed and banished by dozens. Those who fled\r\nfrom their homes leaving their untasted breakfasts to be eaten by the\r\nintruding soldiers, those who were scattered through the numerous\r\nchurches, those who attempted to defend the breaches in the walls--all\r\nalike were treated without mercy.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral of St. Lambert, Charles did endeavour to protect. \"The\r\nduke himself went thither, and one man I saw him kill with his own\r\nhand, whereupon all the company departed and that particular church\r\nwas not pillaged, but at the end the men who had taken refuge there\r\nwere captured as well as the wealth of the church.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVIER DE LA MARCHE\r\n\r\n(FROM MS. REPRODUCED IN MÉM. COURONNÉS, ETC., PAR L'ACAD,\r\n\r\nROYALE DE BELGIQUE VOL. XLIX.)]\r\n\r\nAt about midday Charles joined Louis at the episcopal palace, where\r\nthe latter had found apartments better suited to his rank than the\r\nrude huts that had sheltered him for the past few days. The king was\r\nin good spirits and enjoyed his dinner in spite of the unsavoury\r\nscenes that were still in progress about him. He manifested great joy\r\nin the successful assault, and was lavish in his praises of the duke's\r\ncourage, taking care that his admiring phrases should be promptly\r\nreported to his cousin.[4] His one great preoccupation, however, was\r\nto return to his own realm.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the duke and he made good cheer together. \"If the king\r\nhad praised his works behind his back, still more loud was he in\r\nhis open admiration. And the duke was pleased.\" No telling sign of\r\nfriendship for Charles had Louis spared that day, so terrified was he\r\nlest some testimony from his ancient protégés might prove his ruin.\r\n\"Let the word be Burgundy,\" he had cried to his followers when the\r\nattack began. \"_Tuez, tuez, vive Bourgogne_.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another contemporaneous historian who somewhat apologetically\r\nrelates the following incident of this interview.[5] In this friendly\r\nSabbath day chat, Charles asked Louis how he ought to treat Liege when\r\nhis soldiers had finished their work. No trace of kindliness towards\r\nhis old friends was there in the king's answer.\r\n\r\n\"Once my father had a high tree near his house, inhabited by crows\r\nwho had built their nests thereon and disturbed his repose by their\r\nchatter. He had the nests removed but the crows returned and built\r\nanew. Several times was this repeated. Then he had the tree cut down\r\nat the roots. After that my father slept quietly.\"\r\n\r\nFour or five days passed before Louis dared press the question of his\r\nreturn home. The following note written in Italian, dated on the day\r\nof the assault, is significant of his state of mind:\r\n\r\n\r\n    LOUIS XI. TO THE COUNT DE FOIX\r\n\r\n    \"Monseigneur the Prince:\r\n\r\n    \"To-day my brother of Burgundy and I entered in great multitude\r\n    and with force into this city of Liege, and because I have great\r\n    desire to return, I advise you that on next Tuesday morning I will\r\n    depart hence, and I will not cease riding without making any stops\r\n    until I reach there.[6] I pray you to let me know what is to be\r\n    done.\r\n\r\n    \"Writ at Liege, October 30th.\r\n\r\n    \"LOYS\r\n\r\n    \"DE LA LOERE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctilious was Louis in his assurances to his host that if he could\r\nbe of any further aid he hoped his cousin would command him. If there\r\nwere, indeed, nothing, he thought his best plan would be to go to\r\nParis and have the late treaty duly recorded and published to insure\r\nits validity. Charles grumbled a little, but finally agreed to speed\r\nhis parting guest after the treaty had been again read aloud to the\r\nking so that he might dissent from any one of its articles or ever\r\nafter hold his peace.\r\n\r\nQuite ready was Louis to re-confirm everything sworn to at Peronne.\r\nJust as he was departing he put one more query: \"'If perchance my\r\nbrother now in Brittany should be dissatisfied with the share I accord\r\nhim out of love to you, what do you want me to do?' The duke answered\r\nabruptly and without thought: 'If he does not wish to take it, but\r\nif you content him otherwise, I will trust to you two.' From this\r\nquestion and answer arose great things as you shall hear later. So\r\nthe king departed at his pleasure, and Mons. de Cordes and d'Émeries,\r\nGrand Bailiff of Hainaut escorted him out of ducal territory.\"[7]\r\n\r\n    \"O wonderful and memorable crime of this king of the French\r\n    [declares a contemporaneous Liege sympathiser.][8] Scarcely\r\n    anything so bad can be found in ancient annals or in modern\r\n    history. What could be more stupid or more perfidious, or a better\r\n    instance of infamy than for a king who had incited a people to\r\n    arms against the Burgundians to act thus for the sake of his own\r\n    safety? Not once but many times had he pledged them his faith,\r\n    offering them defence and assistance against the same Burgundians.\r\n    And now when they are overwhelmed and confounded by this\r\n    Burgundian duke, this king actually co-operates with their foe, to\r\n    their damage, wears that foe's insignia and dares to hide himself\r\n    behind those emblems, and assist to destroy those to whom he\r\n    himself had furnished aid and subsidies with pledges of good\r\n    faith! I am ashamed to commit this to writing, and to hand it down\r\n    to posterity, knowing that it will seem incredible to many. But\r\n    it is so notorious throughout France and is confirmed by so many\r\n    adequate witnesses who have seen and heard these things that no\r\n    room is left for doubt of their veracity except to one desiring to\r\n    ignore the truth.\"[9]\r\n\r\nNovember 2d is the date of Louis's departure. It needs no stretch\r\nof the imagination to believe the words of his little Swiss page,\r\nDiesbach, when he says that on reaching French soil Louis dismounted\r\nand kissed the ground in a paroxysm of joy that he was his own man\r\nagain.[10] Devoutly, too, he gave thanks to God for helping him in his\r\nneed. Still this joy was concealed under euphemistic phrases in his\r\ncorrespondence. On November 5th, he wrote again to the Duke of Milan\r\nfrom Beaumont:\r\n\r\n    \"We went in person with the duke against the Liegeois, on account\r\n    of their rebellion and offence, and the city being reduced by\r\n    force to the power of the duke, we have left him in some part of\r\n    Liege as we were anxious to return to our kingdom of France.\"\r\n\r\nIn January, 1469, Guillaume Toustain, the brother of the faithful\r\nsecretary Aloysius Toustain, who had written several of Louis's\r\nletters from Liege, goes to Pavia to finish his studies, and Louis\r\nwrites to the Duke of Milan asking him to assure his protégé a\r\npleasant reception in the university.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the treaty took place duly at Paris on Saturday,\r\nNovember 19th, and the king also sternly forbade the circulation of\r\nany \"paintings, rondels, ballads, songs, or defamatory pamphlets\"\r\nabout Charles.[11] The same informant tells us that loquacious birds\r\nwere put under a ban.\r\n\r\n    \"And on the same day in behalf of the king, and by virtue of his\r\n    commission addressed to a young man of Paris named Henry Perdriel,\r\n    all the magpies, jays, and _chouettes_, caged or otherwise, were\r\n    taken in charge, and a record was made of all the places where the\r\n    said birds were taken and also all that they knew how to say, like\r\n    _larron, paillart_, etc., _va hors, va! Perrette donnes moi à\r\n    boire_, and various other phrases that they had been taught.\"\r\n\r\nAbbé le Grand thinks that \"Perrette\" was meant for Peronne instead of\r\na mistress of Louis of that name. But this conjecture seems the only\r\nbasis for the very deep-rooted tradition that _Peronne_ was a word\r\nLouis could not bear to have uttered.\r\n\r\n\"In the way of justice there is nothing going on here, [wrote one\r\nAnthony de Loisey from Liege to the president of Burgundy], except\r\nevery day they hang and draw such Liegeois as are found or have been\r\ntaken prisoners and have no money to ransom themselves. The city is\r\nwell plundered, nothing remains but rubbish. For example I have not\r\nbeen able to find a sheet of paper fit for writing to you, but with\r\nall my pains could get nothing but some leaves from an old book.\"[12]\r\n\r\nCharles decided that nothing should be left standing except churches\r\nand ecclesiastical buildings. On November 9th, before the final fires\r\nwere lit, he departed from the wretched town and went down the left\r\nbank of the Meuse to an abbey on the river, where he paused for the\r\nnight. Four leagues distant from the city was this place, and from it\r\nwere plainly visible the flames of the burning buildings on that grim\r\nSt. Hubert's Day--a day when Liege had been wont to give vent to\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n\"From all the dangers that had encompassed him, Charles escaped with\r\nhis life, simply because his hour had not yet struck, and because\r\nhe was God's chosen instrument to punish the sinning city,\" is the\r\nverdict of one chronicler who does not spare his fellow-Liegeois for\r\ntheir follies while he profoundly pities their fate.[13]\r\n\r\nOut of the many contemporaneous accounts a portion of a private letter\r\nfrom the duke's cup-bearer to his sister is added:[14]\r\n\r\n    \"Very dear sister, with a very good heart I recommend myself to\r\n    you and to all my good friends, men and women in our parts, not\r\n    forgetting my _beaux-pères,_ Martin Stephen and Dan Gauthier. Pray\r\n    know that, thanks to God, I and all my people are safe and sound.\r\n    As to my horses, one was wounded and another is sick in the hands\r\n    of the marshals at Namur, and the others are thin enough and have\r\n    no grain to eat except hay. The weather, has, indeed, been enough\r\n    to strike a chill to the hearts of men and horses. Since we left\r\n    Burgundy there have not been three fine days in succession and we\r\n    are in a worse state than wolves.\r\n\r\n    \"You already know how we passed through Lorraine and Ratellois\r\n    without troubling about Salesart or other French captains, nor the\r\n    other Lorrainers either, although they were under orders to\r\n    attack us, and were no more afraid of us than we of them. As we\r\n    approached the territory of Hainaut, M. the duke sent Messire\r\n    Pierre de Harquantbault[15] to us to show us what road to take.\r\n    He told us that the duke had made a treaty with the king, who had\r\n    visited him, news that filled us with astonishment....\r\n\r\n    After skirmishing for several days we reached the faubourgs of\r\n    Liege and remained there three of four days under arms, with no\r\n    sleep and little food, and our horses standing in the rain with no\r\n    shelter but the trees. While we were thus lodged, the king and\r\n    the duke with a fair escort arrived and took up their quarters in\r\n    certain houses near the faubourg. [... Constant firing was\r\n    interchanged for several days. Sallies were essayed and men were\r\n    slain.]\r\n\r\n    \"Finally a direct attack was made on the king and Monseigneur\r\n    and there were more of their people than ours and that night\r\n    Monseigneur was in great danger. The following Sunday at 9 A.M. we\r\n    began the assault in three separate quarters. It was a fine thing\r\n    to see the men-at-arms march on the walls of the said city, some\r\n    climbing and others scaling them with ladders. The standards\r\n    of monseigneur the marshal and monsgn. de Renty who had been\r\n    stationed together in the faubourgs, were the first within the\r\n    said city which contained at that moment sixteen to eighteen\r\n    thousand combatants, who were surprised when they saw their walls\r\n    scaled.\r\n\r\n    \"In a moment we entered crying 'Burgundy' and 'city gained.' Ever\r\n    so many of their people were slain and drowned in their flight. We\r\n    flew to reach the market-place and the church of St. Lambert where\r\n    a number of prisoners were taken and thrown into the water. Our\r\n    ensign stood in the midst of the fray on the market-place, in the\r\n    hopes that they would rally for a combat but they rallied only\r\n    to flee. While we held our position on the square several were\r\n    created knights.... All the churches--more than four hundred--were\r\n    pillaged and plundered. It is rumoured that they will be burnt\r\n    together with the rest of the city. Piteous it is to see what ill\r\n    is wrought.... [The king] stayed in the city with Monseigneur two\r\n    or three days. Then he departed, it is said for Brussels to await\r\n    my said lord. It is a great thing to have seen the puissance of my\r\n    master, _which is great enough to defeat an emperor_. I believe\r\n    the Burgundians will shortly return to Burgundy.\r\n\r\n    \"I paid my respects to my said lord, who received me very well. At\r\n    present I am listed[16] among those whose term is almost expired\r\n    and I am ready to follow him wherever he wishes until my service\r\n    is out, which will be soon. I would have written before had I had\r\n    any one to send it by. Pray write me about yourself by the first\r\n    comer. Praying our Lord, beloved sister, to keep you. Written in\r\n    Liege, November 8, 1468.\r\n\r\n    \"JEHAN DE MAZILLES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sober letter and other accounts by reliable witnesses agree as to\r\nthe terrible havoc wrought in the city by the assault on October 30th\r\nand by determined and systematic measures of destruction, both during\r\nCharles's ten days' sojourn for the express purpose of completing the\r\npunishment and after his departure. Yet the result assuredly fell\r\nshort of the intention. The destruction was not complete as was that\r\nof Dinant. Vitality remained, apart from the ecclesiastical nucleus\r\nintentionally preserved by the duke.\r\n\r\nHaving watched the tongues of flame lap the unfortunate city, Charles\r\nturned with his army towards Franchimont, that rugged hill country\r\nwhich had proved a nest of hardy and persistent antagonists to\r\nBurgundian pretensions. Jehan de Mazilles is in close attendance and\r\ngives further details of the pitiless fashion in which Charles carried\r\nout his purpose of leaving no seed of resistance to germinate. Four\r\nnights and three days they sojourned in a certain little village while\r\nthere was a hard frost and where, without unarming, they \"slept under\r\nthe trees and drank water.\" Meantime a small party was despatched\r\nby the duke to attack the stronghold of Franchimont. The despairing\r\nLiegeois who had taken refuge there abandoned it, and it was taken by\r\nassault. A few more days and the duke was assured that Liege and her\r\npeople were shorn of their strength. When the remnant of survivors\r\nbegan to creep back to the city and tried to recover what was left\r\nof their property, many were the questions to be settled. Lawsuits\r\nsucceeded to turmoils and lingered on for years.\r\n\r\nIn the lordly manner of conquerors Charles, too, demanded\r\nreimbursement for his trouble in bending these free citizens to\r\nhis illegal will. The reinstated bishop wanted his rents and legal\r\nperquisites, all difficult to collect, and many were the ponderous\r\ndocuments that passed on the subject. How justly pained sounds\r\nCharles's remonstrance on the default of payment of taxes to his\r\nfriend, the city's lord!\r\n\r\n\"Therefore [he writes,] in consideration of these things, taking into\r\naccount the terror of our departure to Brussels last January, we\r\ndecide, my brother and I, that the payment of both _gabelle_ and poll\r\ntax must be forced, and that we cannot permit the retarding of such\r\ntaxes under any colour or pretence. At the request of our brother and\r\ncousin we order the inhabitants of the said territories to pay both\r\n_gabelle_ and poll tax, all that is due from the time it was imposed\r\nand for the time to come, under penalty of the confiscation of their\r\ngoods and their persons.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the old story of bricks without straw--taxes and rents for\r\nproperty ruthlessly destroyed were so easy. To this extent of tyranny\r\nhad Duke Philip never gone, and undoubtedly the treatment of Liege was\r\na step towards Charles's final disaster. So much hatred was excited\r\nagainst him that his adherents fell off one by one when his luck began\r\nto fail him.\r\n\r\nNo omen of misfortune was to be seen at this time, however. That month\r\nof November saw him master absolute wherever he was and he used his\r\npower autocratically. At Huy, he had a number of prisoners executed.\r\nAt Louvain, at Brussels, he gave fresh examples of his relentlessness\r\nas an overlord.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Commines, ii., ch. xi.

His self-esteem was moreover\r\ngratified by the regard shown to him at home and abroad. A man who\r\ncould force a royal neighbour into playing the pitiful rôle enacted by\r\nLouis XI. at Peronne was assuredly a man to be respected if not loved.\r\nAnd messages of admiration and respect couched in various terms\r\nwere despatched from many quarters to the duke as soon as he was at\r\nBrussels to receive them.\r\n\r\nGhent had long since made apologies for the sorry reception accorded\r\nto their incoming Count of Flanders in 1467, but Charles had postponed\r\nthe formal _amende_ until a convenient moment of leisure. January 15,\r\n1469, was finally appointed for this ceremony and the occasion was\r\nutilised to show the duke's grandeur, the city's humiliation, to as\r\nmany people as possible who might spread the report far and wide.\r\n\r\nIt was a Sunday. Out in the courtyard of the palace the snow was thick\r\non the ground where a group of Ghent burghers cooled their heels for\r\nan hour and a half, awaiting a summons to the ducal presence. There,\r\ntoo, where every one could see those emblems of the artisans'\r\ncorporate strength, fluttered fifty-two banners unfurled before the\r\ndeans of the Ghentish _métiers_.[1]\r\n\r\nWithin, the great hall of the palace showed a splendid setting for a\r\nbrilliant assembly. The most famous Burgundian tapestries hung on the\r\nwalls. Episodes from the careers of Alexander, of Hannibal, and of\r\nother notable ancients formed the background for the duke and his\r\nnobles, knights of the Golden Fleece, in festal array. As spectators,\r\ntoo, there were all the envoys and ambassadors then present in\r\nBrussels from \"France, England, Hungary, Bohemia, Naples, Aragon,\r\nSicily, Cyprus, Norway, Poland, Denmark, Russia, Livornia, Prussia,\r\nAustria, Milan, Lombardy, and other places.\"\r\n\r\nCharles himself was installed grandly on a kind of throne, and to his\r\nfeet Olivier de la Marche conducted the civic procession of penitents.\r\nBefore this pompous gathering, after a statement of the city's sin and\r\nsorrow, the precious charter called the Grand Privilege of Ghent\r\nwas solemnly read aloud, and then cut up into little pieces with a\r\npen-knife. Next followed a recitation of the penalties imposed upon,\r\nand accepted by, the citizens (closing of the gates, etc)., and then\r\nthe paternal Count of Flanders, duly mollified, pronounced the fault\r\nforgiven with the benediction, \"By virtue of this submission and by\r\nkeeping your promises and being good children, you shall enjoy our\r\ngrace and we will be a good prince.\" \"May our Saviour Jesus Christ\r\nconfirm and preserve this peace to the end of this century,\" is the\r\npious ejaculation with which the _Relation_ closes.\r\n\r\nAmong the witnesses of the above scene, when the independent citizens\r\nof Ghent meekly posed as the duke's children, were envoys from George\r\nPodiebrad, ex-king of Bohemia. Lately deposed by the pope, he was\r\nseeking some favourable ally who might help him to recover his realm.\r\nHe had conceived a plan for a coalition between Bohemia, Poland,\r\nAustria, and Hungary to present a solid rampart against the Turks,\r\nand strong enough to dictate to emperor and pope. He was ready for\r\nintrigue with any power and had approached Louis XI. and Matthias\r\nCorvinus, King of Hungary, before turning to Charles of Burgundy.[2]\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Emperor Frederic tried to knit links with this same\r\nMatthias by suggesting that he might be the next emperor, assuring\r\nhim that he could count on the support of the electors of Mayence, of\r\nTrèves, and of Saxony. He himself was world-weary and was anxious to\r\nexchange his imperial cares for the repose of the Church could he\r\nonly find a safe guardian for his son, Maximilian, and a desirable\r\nsuccessor for himself. Would not Matthias consider the two offices?\r\n\r\nPotent arguments like these induced Matthias not only to turn his back\r\non Podiebrad, but to accept that deposed monarch's crown which the\r\nBohemian nobles offered him May 3, 1469. Then he proceeded to ally\r\nhimself with Frederic, elector palatine, and with the elector of\r\nBavaria. This was the moment when the ex-king of Bohemia made renewed\r\noffers of friendly alliance to Charles of Burgundy. In his name the\r\nSire de Stein brought the draft of a treaty of amity to Charles which\r\ncontained the provision that Podiebrad should support the election\r\nof Charles as King of the Romans, in consideration of the sum of two\r\nhundred thousand florins (Rhenish).[2]\r\n\r\nThis modest sum was to secure not only Podiebrad's own vote but his\r\n\"influence\" with the Archbishop of Mayence, the Elector of Saxony\r\nand the Margrave of Brandenburg.[4] While Podiebrad thus dangled\r\nthe ultimate hopes of the imperial crown before the duke's eyes, he\r\nover-estimated his credulity. As a matter of fact the royal exile had\r\nno \"influence\" at all with the first named elector, and the last, too,\r\nshowed no disposition whatsoever to serve his unstable policy. Both\r\nwere content to advise Emperor Frederic. The sole result of the empty\r\novertures was to increase Charles's own sense of importance.\r\n\r\nAnother negotiation which sought him unasked had, however, a material\r\ninfluence on the course of events, and must be touched on in some\r\ndetail. Sigismund of Austria--first duke then archduke,--Count of\r\nTyrol, cousin of the Emperor Frederic, was a member of the House of\r\nHabsburg. In 1449, he had married Eleanor of Scotland, and became\r\nbrother-in-law of Louis during the term of the dauphin's first\r\nmarriage. An indolent, extravagant prince, he was greatly dominated\r\nby his courtiers. His heritage as Count of Tyrol included certain\r\nterritories lying far from his capital, Innsbruck. Certain portions\r\nof Upper Alsace, lands on both sides of the Rhine, Thurgau, Argau in\r\nSwitzerland, Breisgau, and some other seigniories in the Black Forest\r\nwere under his sway.\r\n\r\nThese particular domains were so remote from Innsbruck that the\r\nauthority of the hereditary overlord had long been eluded. The nobles\r\npillaged the land near their castles very much at their own sweet\r\nwill. The harassed burghers appealed to the Alsatian Décapole,[5] and\r\nagain to the free Swiss cantons for protection, and sometimes obtained\r\nmore than they wanted.\r\n\r\nMulhouse was seriously affected by these lawless depredations. To her,\r\nBerne promised aid in a twenty-five years' alliance signed in 1466,\r\nand at Berne's insistance the cowardly nobles restrained their\r\nlicense. But when the city attempted to extend its authority Sigismund\r\ninterfered. Having no army, however, he could not recover Waldshut,\r\nwhich the Swiss claimed a right to annex, except by offering ten\r\nthousand florins for the town's ransom. Poor in cash as he was in men,\r\nhe had, however, no means to pay this ransom and begged aid in every\r\ndirection. Moreover, he feared further aggressions from the cantons,\r\nwhich were growing more daring. What man in Europe was better able to\r\nteach them a lesson than Charles, the destroyer of Liege, the stern\r\ncurber of undue liberty in Flanders? Was he not the very person to\r\ntame insolent Swiss cowherds?\r\n\r\nIn the course of the year 1468, Sigismund made known to Charles his\r\ndesire for a bargain, intimating that in case of the duke's refusal,\r\nhe would carry his wares to Louis XI. At that moment, Charles was\r\nbusied with Liege and showed no interest in Sigismund's proposition.\r\nThe latter tried to see Louis XI. personally in accordance with his\r\nimperial cousin's advice that an interview might be more effective\r\nthan a letter.\r\n\r\nIt did not prove a propitious time, however; Louis was deeply engaged\r\nwith Burgundy and he was not disposed to take any steps that might\r\nestrange the Swiss--and any espousal of Sigismund's interests might\r\nalienate them. He did not even permit an opening to be made, but\r\nstopped Sigismund's approach to him by a message that he would not for\r\na moment entertain a suggestion inimical to those dear friends of his\r\nin the cantons--a sentiment that quickly found its way to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThus stayed in his effort to win Louis's ear, Sigismund decided that\r\nhe would make another essay towards a Burgundian alliance, this time\r\nface to face with the duke. On to Flanders he journeyed and found\r\nCharles in the midst of the ostentatious magnificence already\r\ndescribed. Ordinary affairs of life were conducted with a splendour\r\nhardly attained by the emperor in the most pompous functions of his\r\ncourt. Sigismund was absolutely dazzled by the evidence of easy\r\nprosperity. The fact that a maiden was the duke's sole heiress led\r\nthe Austrian to conceive the not unnatural idea that this attractive\r\nBurgundian wealth might be turned into the impoverished imperial\r\ncoffers by a marriage between Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian, the\r\nemperor's son.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY OF BURGUNDY FROM CONTEMPORANEOUS MINIATURE\r\nREPRODUCED IN BARANTE, \"LES DUCS DE BOURGOGNE\"]\r\n\r\nThe visitor not only thought of this possibility, but he immediately\r\nbroached it to Charles. The bait was swallowed. As to the main\r\nproposition which Sigismund had come expressly to make, that, too,\r\nwas not rejected. The duke perceived that the transfer of the Rhenish\r\nlands to his jurisdiction might militate to his advantage. A passage\r\nwould be opened towards the south for his troops without the need of\r\ndemanding permission from any reluctant neighbour. The risk of trouble\r\nwith the Swiss did not affect him when weighing the advantages of\r\nSigismund's proffer, a proffer which he finally decided to accept.\r\nProbably he found his guest a pleasant party to a bargain, for not\r\nonly did he broach the tempting alliance between Mary and Maximilian,\r\nbut he, too, seems to have hinted that the title of \"King of the\r\nRomans\" might be added to the long list of appellations already signed\r\nby Charles.[6] As Sigismund was richer in kin, if not in coin, than\r\nthe feeble Podiebrad, Charles gave serious heed to the suggestion\r\nwhich fell incidentally from his guest's lips, in the course of the\r\nlong conversations held at Bruges.\r\n\r\nCertain precautions were taken to protect Charles from being dragged\r\ninto Swiss complications against his will, and then in May, 1469,\r\nthe treaty of St. Omer was signed,[7] wherein the Duke of Burgundy\r\naccorded his protection to Sigismund of Austria and received from him\r\nall his seigniorial rights within certain specified territories.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of this cession comprised Upper Alsace and\r\nthe county of Ferrette, but there were also many other fragments of\r\nterritory and rights of seigniory involved, besides lordship over\r\nvarious Rhenish cities, such as Rheinfelden, Saeckingen, Lauffenburg,\r\nWaldshut and Brisac. This last named town commanded the route\r\neastward, as Waldshut that to the southeast, and Thann the highway\r\nthrough the Vosges region.\r\n\r\nFifty thousand florins was the price for the property and the claims\r\ntransferred from Sigismund to Charles. Ten thousand were to be paid at\r\nonce, in order to ransom Waldshut from the Swiss. The remainder was\r\ndue on September 24th. On his part, Sigismund specifically recognised\r\nthe duke's right to redeem all domains nominally his but mortgaged for\r\nthe time being, certain estates or seignorial rights having been thus\r\nalienated for 150 years.\r\n\r\nThis territorial transfer was not a sale. It was a mortgage, but a\r\nmortgage with possession to the mortgagee and further restricted by\r\nthe provision that there could be no redemption unless the mortgager\r\ncould repay at Besançon the whole loan plus all the outlay made by the\r\nmortgagee up to that date. Instalment payments were expressly ruled\r\nout. The entire sum intact was made obligatory. Therefore the danger\r\nof speedy redemption did not disquiet Charles. He knew the man he had\r\nto deal with. Sigismund's lack of foresight and his prodigality were\r\nnotorious. There was faint chance that he could ever command the\r\namount in question. Accordingly, Charles was fairly justified in\r\ncounting the mortgaged territory as annexed to Burgundy in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nSigismund pocketed his florins eagerly. Nothing could have been more\r\nwelcome to him. But this relief from the pressure of his pecuniary\r\nembarrassment did not inspire him with love for the man who held his\r\nlost lands. His sentiments towards Charles were very similar to those\r\nof an heir towards a usurer who has helped him in a temporary strait\r\nby mulcting him of his natural rights.\r\n\r\nAs for the emperor, when this transfer of territory was an\r\naccomplished fact, he began to take fright at the consequences. He did\r\nnot like this intrusion of a powerful French peer into the imperial\r\ncircle.[8] At the same time he was ready to make him share\r\nresponsibility in any further difficulties that might arise between\r\nSigismund and the Swiss.\r\n\r\nThe least skilful of prophets could have foreseen difficulties for\r\nCharles on his own account, both foreign and domestic. His own\r\nrelations with the Swiss had always been friendly enough, but he had\r\nnever before been so near a neighbour, while, within the Rhine lands,\r\nit was an open question whether the bartered inhabitants were to\r\nenjoy or regret their new tie with Burgundy. The importance of their\r\nsentiments was a matter of as supreme indifference to Charles as was\r\ndanger from the Confederation. Neither conciliation nor diplomacy\r\nwas in his thoughts. He had no conception of the intricacies of the\r\nsituation. He counted the landgraviate as definitely his by the treaty\r\nof St. Omer as Brabant by heritage or Liege by conquest.\r\n\r\nThe need of a kindly policy towards the little valley towns--a policy\r\nthat might have won their allegiance--never occurred to him. They were\r\nhis property and Peter von Hagenbach was, in course of time, made\r\nlieutenant-governor in his behalf.\r\n\r\nApart from all personal considerations of enmity and amity of natives\r\nand neighbours, the territory of Upper Alsace and the county of\r\nFerrette, delivered from needy Austria to rich Burgundy, like a coat\r\npawned by a poor student, was held under very complex and singular\r\nconditions.[9] The status of the bargain between Sigismund and Charles\r\nwas in point of fact something between pawn and sale, according to the\r\npoint of view. Sigismund fully intended to redeem it, while Charles\r\ndid not admit that possibility as remotely contingent. Nor was that\r\nthe only peculiarity. The itemised list of the ceded territories as\r\ngiven in the treaty was far from telling the facts of the possessions\r\npassing to Sigismund's proxy.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the Austrian seigniories were not compact. They\r\nwere scattered here and there in the midst of lands ruled by others,\r\nas the Bishop of Strasburg, the Abbé of St. Blaise in the Black\r\nForest, the count Palatine, the citizens of Basel and of Mulhouse, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe existent variety in the extent and nature of Austrian title was\r\nextraordinary. Nearly every possible combination of dismembered\r\nprerogative and actual tenure had resulted from the long series of\r\nducal compositions. In some localities a toll or a quit-rent was the\r\nsole cession, and again a toll or a prerogative was almost the only\r\nresidue remaining to the ostensible overlord, while all his former\r\nproperty or transferable birthright privileges were lodged in\r\nvarious hands on divers tenures. There were cases in which the\r\nmortgagee--noble, burgher, or municipal corporation--had taken the\r\nexact place of the Austrian duke and in so doing had become the vassal\r\nof his debtor, stripped of all vested interest but his sovereignty.\r\nFor in these bargains wherein elements of the Roman contract and\r\nfeudal customs were curiously blended, two classes of rights had been\r\ninvariably reserved by the ducal mortgagers:\r\n\r\n  (1) Monopolies, regal in nature, such as assured free circulation on\r\nthe highways, the old Roman roads, all jurisdiction of passports and\r\ntravellers' protection.\r\n\r\n  (2) The suzerainty. This comprised the power to confer fiefs, of\r\nrequisition of military service, of requesting _aids_ and admission to\r\nstrongholds, cities, or castles, _le droit de forteresse jurable et\r\nrendable_.\r\n\r\nIn these regards the compact between Charles and Sigismund differed\r\nfrom all previous covenants not only in degree, but in kind. The Duke\r\nof Burgundy entered into the _sovereign_ as well as into the mangled,\r\nmaimed, and curtailed proprietary rights of the hereditary over-lord.\r\n\r\nIn his assumption of this involved and doubtful property, Charles laid\r\nheavy responsibilities on his shoulders. The actual price of fifty\r\nthousand gold florins paid to Sigismund was a mere fraction of the\r\npecuniary obligations incurred, while the weight of care was difficult\r\nto gauge. He succeeded to princes weak, frivolous, prodigal, whose\r\nmisrule had long been a curse to the land. The incursions of\r\nthe Swiss, the repeated descents of the Rhine nobles from their\r\ncrag-lodged strongholds to pillage and destroy, terrified merchants\r\nand plunged peaceful labourers into misery.\r\n\r\nThrough hatred of the absentee Austrians, the neighbouring cities\r\nrepeatedly became the accomplices of these brigands, affording them\r\nasylums for refitting and free passage when they were laden with\r\nevident booty.\r\n\r\nIn all departments of finance and administration disorder prevailed.\r\nThe chief officials, castellans and councillors, enjoyed high salaries\r\nfor neglected duties. The castles were in wretched repair and there\r\nwere insufficient troops to guard the roads. There was no dependence\r\nupon the receipts nominally to be expected. In the sub-mortgaged\r\nlands, the lords simply levied what they could, without the slightest\r\nresponsibility for the order of the domain; they did not hesitate to\r\ncharge their suzerain for repairs never made, confident that no one\r\nwould verify their declaration.\r\n\r\nIn the territories of the immediate domain, the Austrian dukes and\r\ntheir officials had no notion of the rigid system maintained in\r\nBurgundy. Only here and there can little memoranda be found and these\r\nare confused and obscure. There is a dearth of accurate records like\r\nthose voluminous registers of outlays kept by Burgundian receivers,\r\nregisters so rich in detail that they are more valuable for the\r\nhistorian than any chronicle.\r\n\r\nExact appraisal of the resources of these _pays de par de là_ was very\r\ndifficult. Between 1469 and 1473 there were three efforts to obtain\r\nreliable information by means of as many successive commissions\r\ndespatched to the Rhine valley by the Duke of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nEnvoys drew up minutes of their observations in addition to their\r\nofficial reports and all were preserved in the archives. As these were\r\nwritten from testimony gathered on the spot, such as the accounts of\r\nthe receivers now lost, etc., there is real value in the documents.\r\n\r\nThe first commission in behalf of Burgundy was composed of two Germans\r\nand three Walloons. One of the former was Peter von Hagenbach, who\r\nwon no enviable reputation in the later exercise of his office as\r\nlieutenant-governor of the annexed region, to which he was shortly\r\nafterwards appointed. This first commission entered into formal\r\npossession in Charles's name and instituted some desired reforms\r\nimmediately, such as policing the highways, etc.\r\n\r\nThe second commission made its visit in 1471. It consisted of Jean\r\nPellet, treasurer of Vesoul, and Jean Poinsot, procureur-general of\r\nAmont.\r\n\r\nThe third commission (1473) was under the auspices of Monseigneur\r\nCoutault, master of accounts at Dijon. He carried with him the report\r\nof his predecessors and made his additions thereto.\r\n\r\nCharles's directions to Poinsot and Pellet (June 13, 1471) were vague\r\nand general. They were \"to see the conduct of his affairs\" _(voir la\r\nconduite de ses affaires_). The important point was to find out how\r\nmuch revenue could be obtained. As the duke's plan of expansion grew\r\nlarger he had need of all his resources.\r\n\r\nThe reports were eminently discouraging. Outlay was needed\r\neverywhere--income was small. As the chances of peculation diminished,\r\nthe castellans deserted their posts and left the castles to decay.\r\nThe Burgundian commission of 1471 found the difficulties of their\r\nexploration increased by two items. Charles had not advanced an\r\nallowance for their expenses and they were anxious to be back at\r\nVesoul by Michaelmas, the date of the change in municipal offices and\r\nof appropriations for the year. It was in hopes of receiving advance\r\nmoneys that they delayed in starting, but the approaching election and\r\ncoming winter finally decided them to set out, pay their own expenses,\r\nand complete the business as rapidly as they could in a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe summary of this report of 1471 was that there was little present\r\nprospect that Charles would be able to reimburse himself for his\r\nnecessary expenses. An undue portion of authority and of revenue was\r\nlegally lodged in alien hands. Charles was possessed of germs of\r\nrights rather than of actual rights. The earlier creditors of Austria\r\nheld all the best mortgages with their attendant emoluments. The\r\nimmediate profits accruing to the Duke of Burgundy fell far short\r\nof the minimum necessary to disburse to keep his government, his\r\nstrongholds, his highways in repair. Very disturbed were the good\r\ntreasurer of Vesoul and the procureur-general of Amont at this state\r\nof affairs, and distressed at the prospect of the ampler receipts from\r\nBurgundy being required to relieve the pressing necessities of the\r\npoor territories _de par de là_.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this contingency, the commissioners recommended the duke\r\nto redeem all the existing mortgages great and small. It would cost\r\n140,000 florins, but the revenue would at once increase with the new\r\nsecurity which would immediately follow under firm Burgundian rule.\r\nSole master, Charles could then enforce obedience from nobles and\r\ncities and better conditions would be inaugurated.\r\n\r\nEvidently this rational advice was not taken, for it is repeated by\r\nCoutault in 1473. Redemption of the mortgages, \"if your affairs can\r\nafford it,\" is the counsel given by the chamber of accounts at Dijon,\r\nthough this sage board adds that they were well aware that in the\r\nprevious month Monseigneur could not put his hands on a hundred\r\nflorins to redeem one wretched little _gagerie._ The native coffers of\r\nthe region did not suffice to settle the salaries of the officers in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nSuch then was the new acquisition of Charles after four years of his\r\nadministration. Peter von Hagenbach, his deputy in charge of this\r\nunremunerative territory, is a character painted in the darkest\r\ncolours by all historians. It is more than probable that his unpopular\r\nefforts to make bricks without straw were largely responsible for his\r\nunenviable reputation. Ground between the upper and lower millstones\r\nof Charles's clamours for revenues and popular clamours that the\r\npeople had nothing wherewith to pay, Hagenbach developed into a\r\ntaskmaster of the hardest and most unpitying type, who made himself\r\nthoroughly hated by the people he was set to rule.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that there was no cleft in nationality or in\r\nlanguage between governor and governed. He was not a foreigner set\r\nover them. He was one of them raised to a high position. There was\r\nthen no French element in Lower Alsace. It was then German pure and\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER ALSACE AND ADJACENT TERRITORY BY PERMISSION OF\r\nHACHETTE, 1902]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gachard, _Doc. inéd_., i., 204-209. \"Relation de\r\nl'assemblée solennelle tenue à Bruxelles le 15 Jan., 1469.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Toutey, _Charles le Téméraire et la ligue de\r\nConstance_, p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See the text given in Comines-Lenglet, iii., 116.

The thread of the story now returns to 1469,\r\nwhen Charles and Sigismund separated at St. Omer both well pleased\r\nwith their bargain. Charles tarried for a time at Ghent and Bruges\r\nand then proceeded to Zealand and Holland, where his sojourn had been\r\ninterrupted in 1468 by his alarm about French duplicity. In the glow\r\ncaused by his past achievements, his present reputation, and future\r\nprospects, Charles of Burgundy was in a mood to prove to his subjects\r\nhis excellence as a paternal ruler. Wherever he paused on his journey\r\neasy access was permitted to his presence and he was lavish in the\r\ntime given to receiving petitions from the humblest plaintiff. The\r\nfollowing gruesome incident is an illustration of the summary methods\r\nattributed to him.[1]\r\n\r\nShortly before the ducal visit to Middelburg, the governor, a man\r\nof noble birth, a knight, fell in love with a married woman who\r\nindignantly repudiated his advances. In revenge the governor had the\r\nhusband arrested on a charge of high treason. The wife, left without a\r\nprotector, continued obdurate to the knight until the alternative of\r\nher husband's release or his death was offered her as the reward for\r\naccepting the governor's base suit or as the penalty of her refusal.\r\nShe chose to redeem the prisoner. Having paid the price she went to\r\nthe prison and was led to her husband truly, but he lay dead and in\r\nhis coffin!\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Burgundy was once within the Zealand capital, this\r\ninjured woman hastened to throw herself at his feet, a petitioner\r\nfor justice. He heard her complaint and straightway summoned the\r\nex-governor to his presence. The accused confessed that he had been\r\ncarried away by his adoration for the woman, reminded Charles of\r\nhis long and faithful devotion to the late duke and to himself, and\r\noffered any possible reparation for his crime. The duke ordered him to\r\nmarry his victim. The widow was horrified at the suggestion, but was\r\nforced by her family to accept it. After the nuptial benediction, the\r\nknight again appeared before Charles to assure him that the plaintiff\r\nwas satisfied. \"She, yes,\" replied the duke coldly, \"but not I.\" He\r\nremanded the bridegroom to prison, had him shriven and executed all\r\nwithin an hour. Then the bride was summoned and shown her second\r\nhusband in his coffin as she had seen her first, and on the same spot.\r\n\"It was a penalty that hit the innocent as well as the guilty, for the\r\nplaintiff died from the double shock.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke, satisfied with his rigour, went on to Holland. Everywhere he\r\nevinced himself equally uncompromising towards the nobles, amiable and\r\nconsiderate towards the lower classes and humble folk. Various other\r\nstories related about him at this epoch are difficult to accept as\r\nauthentic, for the main detail has appeared at other times under\r\ndifferent guises. Wandering tales seem to alight, like birds of\r\npassage, on successive people in lands and epochs widely apart, mere\r\nhallmarks of certain characteristics re-embodied.\r\n\r\nThe Hague was the duke's headquarters during two months, and there\r\nalso he held open court and gave audience to many embassies in the\r\nmidst of his administrative work pertaining to Holland and its nearest\r\nneighbours. He took measures to recover what he claimed had been\r\nusurped by Utrecht, and he initiated proceedings to make good the\r\ntitle of Lord of Friesland, that will-o'-the wisp to successive Counts\r\nof Holland and never acknowledged by the Frisians. In efforts to weld\r\ntogether the various provinces the months passed, until a new turn of\r\nforeign events began to absorb the duke's whole attention.\r\n\r\nThe details of English politics with all the reasons for revolution\r\nand counter-revolution involved in the complicated civil disorders,\r\nthe Wars of the Roses, affected Charles's policy but they can only\r\nbe suggested in his biography. It must be remembered that the modern\r\nimpression of English stability and French fickleness in political\r\ninstitutions, an impression casting reflections direct and indirect\r\nupon literature as well as history, is based on the changes in France\r\nfrom 1789 down to the fourth quarter of the nineteenth century. Quite\r\nthe reverse is the earlier tradition based on the kaleidoscopic\r\nshifts familiar to several generations of observers in the fifteenth\r\ncentury[2]; stable and firm felt the French as they heard the tidings\r\nof the brief triumphs of belligerent factions across the Channel.\r\n\r\nSince 1461, Henry VI. of the House of Lancaster had been a passive\r\nprisoner, while Margaret of Anjou had exhausted herself in efforts\r\nto win adherents at home and abroad for her captive husband and her\r\nexiled son.[3] In 1463, she had received some aid, some encouragement\r\nfrom Philip of Burgundy, although he had recognised Edward IV. as king\r\nand although, too, his personal sympathies were Yorkish rather than\r\nLancastrian.\r\n\r\nIt was Charles who escorted the errant lady into Lille, but later the\r\nduke himself entertained her munificently. The poverty-stricken exile\r\nprobably found the accompanying ducal gifts more to the immediate\r\npurpose than the ducal feasts. Two thousand gold crowns were bestowed\r\nupon herself, a hundred upon each of her ladies, while various\r\nLancastrian nobles were tided over hard times by useful sums of money.\r\n\r\nPleasant though the recognition was, however, the pecuniary assistance\r\nwas quite insufficient to accomplish Margaret's purpose. For nine\r\nyears Edward IV. sat on his throne and no serious efforts were made to\r\ndislodge him. As he never forgot his mother's lineage, the sympathies\r\nof Charles of Burgundy were with the exiles, and Queen Margaret may\r\nhave counted confidently on that sympathy proving valuable for her son\r\nas soon as Charles himself had a free hand. But when he came into his\r\nheritage, his marriage with Margaret of York put a definite end to\r\nthose hopes. The new duke thereby declared his acceptance of the king\r\nwhom the Earl of Warwick had seated upon the English throne. Then\r\ncame clashing of wills between that king and his too powerful\r\nsubject-adviser.[4] To punish his unruly royal protégé, Warwick turned\r\nhis attention to the Duke of Clarence, brother and heir presumptive to\r\nEdward IV. A marriage was planned between this possible future monarch\r\nand the earl's eldest daughter and then quickly celebrated at Calais\r\nwithout the king's knowledge (July, 1469).\r\n\r\nIn the same summer occurred a rising in Yorkshire, possibly instigated\r\nby Warwick.[5] The malcontents, sixty thousand strong, declared that\r\nthe king was giving ear to base counsellors and must be coerced into\r\nbetter ways. An attempt to suppress this revolt by the royal troops\r\nresulted in a pitched battle where Earl Rivers, the father of\r\nElizabeth Woodville, the young queen, was taken prisoner and beheaded.\r\n\r\nEdward, baffled, finally turned for aid to Warwick. Over the Channel\r\nhastened the earl and his new son-in-law, levied troops, met the king\r\nat Olney, and--Edward found himself if not exactly a prisoner, at\r\nleast under restraint. Two sovereigns--both without power even over\r\ntheir own actions,--such was the situation in England at the end of\r\n1469, when Charles of Burgundy was self-complacently regarding Louis\r\nXI. as a foe convinced of his own inferiority.\r\n\r\nA menacing letter from this redoubtable ducal brother-in-law was\r\nprobably the reason why Edward IV. was set at liberty, and why a\r\nreconciliation was patched up between him and his councillor, with\r\nfull pardon for Warwick's adherents. But it was short-lived. A fresh\r\noutbreak in March, 1470, made another change. Warwick and Clarence\r\nsided with the rebels, the king was victorious, and his unfaithful\r\nfriend and brother were again forced to flee under a shower of menaces\r\nhurled after them.\r\n\r\n    \"But, and He [Clarence] or Richart Erle of Warrewyk our Rebell and\r\n    Traytour come into oure seid Land we woll ... that ye doo Hym\r\n    and Theym to be arrested ... He that Taketh and Bryngeth unto Us\r\n    either of theym, he shal have for his Reward C._l_ of Land in\r\n    Yerely Value to Hym and to his Heyres or Mil. _Lib_ in Redy money\r\n    at his election.\"[6]\r\n\r\nSuch was the proclamation issued on March 22d by the king himself at\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nBetween Edward and Charles a new link had just been forged in the\r\nchain of friendship. The Order of the Garter is thus acknowledged by\r\nthe duke:\r\n\r\n    \"We have to-day received from our much honoured seigneur and\r\n    brother, the king of England, his Order of the Garter together\r\n    with the mantle and other ornaments and things appertaining to the\r\n    said Order and have ... taken the oath according to the statutes\r\n    of the Order.\r\n\r\n    \"Done in our city of Ghent under our Grand Seal, February 4, 1469\r\n    [O.S.].\"[7]\r\n\r\nNow it was in consideration of needs that might arise in the near\r\nfuture, following on the trail of these wide-reaching English\r\nconvulsions, that Charles felt it necessary to make preparations for\r\na strong military defence calculated to suit any emergency. Louis XI.\r\nhad a permanent force at his command. He had made the beginning of the\r\nFrench standing army, the nucleus of one of those bodies that have\r\never since urged each other on to expensive growth from opposite sides\r\nof European frontiers. What one monarch possessed that must his near\r\nneighbour have.\r\n\r\nFeudal service, volunteer militia, paid mercenaries, were all alike\r\nunstable bulwarks for a nation. Nation as yet Charles had not, but\r\nhe wanted to be betimes with his bulwarks. This was why he issued\r\nan ordinance for the levy of a thousand lances, amounting to five\r\nthousand combatants, to be paid with regular wages and kept ready at\r\ncall under officers of his own appointment. The ducal treasury could\r\nnot stand the whole expense. To meet the deficit, Charles asked from\r\nhis Netherland Estates an annual subsidy of 120,000 crowns for three\r\nyears. Power to impose taxes he had none. A request to each individual\r\nprovince was all the requisition that he could make.\r\n\r\nIn this case, most of the provinces approached had acceded to the\r\ndemand, when the Estates of Flanders convened at Lille. Here the\r\nChancellor of Burgundy expounded to them the grounds of the demand,\r\nand then the session was changed to Bruges, where they debated on the\r\nmerits of the request, urged on further by explanatory letters from\r\nCharles. Finally, a deputation was appointed by the Estates to go over\r\nto Ghent and present a _Remonstrance_ to their impatient sovereign\r\nbeggar.\r\n\r\nThree points were set forth. The deputies objected to this grant being\r\nasked only from the lands _de par de ça_--the Netherlands and not from\r\nthe Burgundies. Secondly, they wished a definite assessment imposed on\r\neach province. Thirdly, they desired a declaration that the fiefs and\r\narrière-fiefs already bound to furnish troops should be exempt from\r\nshare in this tax. The remonstrance was courtly in tone. Written\r\nin French, the concluding phrases were in Latin and suggested that\r\nnothing was more becoming a prince than clemency, especially towards\r\nhis subjects.[8]\r\n\r\nVigorous and emphatic was the prince's response.[9] How could Burgundy\r\nfurnish money? It is a poor land. It takes after France.[10] But its\r\nmen make a third of the army. They are the Burgundian contribution. As\r\nto an assessment, what is the use unless the tax is surely to be paid?\r\nOnly out of malice is this idle point suggested.\r\n\r\n    \"You act as you have always done--you Flemings. Neither to my\r\n    father nor to me have you ever been liberal. What you have\r\n    granted--sometimes more than our request--has always been given so\r\n    tardily as to prove the lack of good will. Your Flemish skulls\r\n    are hard and thick and you cling to your stubborn and perverse\r\n    opinions.... I am half of France and half of Portugal and I know\r\n    how to meet such heads as yours, ay and _will_ do it. You have\r\n    always either hated or despised your prince--if powerful you\r\n    hated, if weak you despised. I prefer your hatred to your\r\n    contempt. Not for your privileges or anything else will I permit\r\n    myself to be trampled on--and I have the power to prevent such\r\n    trampling.\"\r\n\r\n    Laying stress on the extreme modesty of his demand, whose purpose\r\n    mainly was for defence of Flanders, the duke proceeded to berate\r\n    his visitors soundly for their presumptuous haggling, declaring\r\n    that as to the fiefs and arrière-fiefs he would see to it that no\r\n    double burdens were borne.\r\n\r\n    \"And when you shall have determined to accord my request,--which\r\n    you will assuredly do (and I do not mean to burden you further\r\n    unless I am forced to it),--send some of your deputies after me to\r\n    Lille or St. Omer, and there, with my chancellor and my council, I\r\n    will determine the apportionment and we will speak also of other\r\n    matters touching my province of Flanders.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this vehement oratory--and this vehemence was repeated on many\r\noccasions--that did more to alienate Charles from his hereditary\r\nsubjects than his actual demands. There is little doubt that his\r\nperiod of residence in their midst brought with it hatred rather\r\nthan liking. No political error of his serves to explain the Flemish\r\nattitude towards the duke as does his method of address, the\r\ngratuitous contempt displayed towards burghers whose purses were\r\nneeded for his game. The _aide_ was granted, indeed, but it was levied\r\nwith sullen reluctance.\r\n\r\nWhat cause Charles had to make his preparations, what were the\r\nproceedings of the English exiles may be seen from the following\r\nletters to his mother and to the town of Ypres. The first is probably\r\nin answer to her questionings; the second is a specimen of the\r\nepistles showered upon the border towns.\r\n\r\n    \"TO MY VERY REDOUBTABLE LADY AND MOTHER,\r\n\r\n    MADAME THE DUCHESS, AT AIRE:\r\n\r\n    \"May it please you to know that in regard to what the Sgr. de\r\n    Crèvecoeur has written you about the king's proclamations that he\r\n    intends to maintain his treaties and promises to me, etc., and has\r\n    no desire to sustain the Earl of Warwick, and wishes my subjects\r\n    to be reimbursed for the damages inflicted by him and his,\r\n    assuredly, my Lady and Mother, the contrary has been and is well\r\n    known before the said publications and after. The Earl of Warwick\r\n    is my foe and could not, according to the treaty existing between\r\n    the king and me, be received in Normandy or elsewhere in the realm\r\n    ... [complaints about the procedure have been sent to king and\r\n    parliament and councillors, without redress, etc.] What is more,\r\n    the Admiral of France has sent thither a spy under pretext of\r\n    carrying a letter to Sgr. de la Groothuse, which man was charged\r\n    to spy upon my ships and by means of a caravel named the\r\n    _Brunette_, sent for this purpose by the admiral, to cut the\r\n    cables to set them adrift and founder--or to capture certain ships\r\n    with such captains, knights, and gentlemen as he could find, and\r\n    myself, too, if they were able.\r\n\r\n    \"Furthermore, the said spy was charged to spy on my towns, etc.,\r\n    and those of the caravel called the _Brunette_ were charged, if\r\n    they failed in taking my ships, or in cutting their cables, to\r\n    set fire to them--all in direct conflict with the terms of the\r\n    treaties, and procedures that the king would never have tolerated\r\n    had he had the slightest intention of maintaining his word ...\r\n    [Charles does not consider Groothuse to blame at all, etc.][11]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Charles of Burgundy to the Magistrates of Ypres, June 10,\r\n1470_\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR FRIENDS:\r\n\r\n    \"It has come to your knowledge how after the Duke of Clarence and\r\n    the Earl of Warwick were expelled from England on account of their\r\n    sedition and their ill deeds, they have declared themselves both\r\n    by words and deeds of aggression our enemies, and on _Vendredi\r\n    absolut_[12] went so far as to capture by fraud ships and property\r\n    belonging to our subjects, and have further done damage whenever\r\n    opportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\n    \"In order to repel them we have ordered them to be attacked on\r\n    the sea. Moreover, at the same time we were advised that the same\r\n    Clarence and Warwick and their people, after they were routed at\r\n    sea by the troops of my honoured lord and brother, Edward, King of\r\n    England, retreated to the marches of Normandy and were honourably\r\n    received at Honfleur by the Admiral of France with all which they\r\n    had saved from the raid on our subjects after the defeat.\r\n\r\n    \"All this was direct infringement of the treaties lately made\r\n    between Monseigneur the king and myself. Therefore, we wrote at\r\n    once to Monsgr. the king begging him not to favour or aid the said\r\n    Clarence and Warwick in his land of Normandy or elsewhere in his\r\n    realm, nor to permit them to sell or distribute the property of\r\n    our subjects, and to show his will by publishing such prohibitions\r\n    throughout Normandy and elsewhere where need is.\r\n\r\n    \"Also we wrote to the court of parliament at Paris, and to the\r\n    council of my said seigneur at Rouen. The answer was that the king\r\n    meant to keep the treaty between him and us and had ordered his\r\n    subjects in Normandy not to retain the property belonging to our\r\n    subjects ... but we have since learned that, notwithstanding,\r\n    this same property has been distributed and ransoms have been\r\n    negotiated in the sight and knowledge of the Admiral of France and\r\n    his officers.\r\n\r\n    \"Moreover, it is perfectly evident that by means of the aid\r\n    furnished by the king to the said Clarence and Warwick, the latter\r\n    are enabled to continue the war on our subjects and not on the\r\n    English, it being understood that they who were banished from\r\n    England are not strong enough to return by the force of arms but\r\n    must do so by friendship and favour.... On account of the above\r\n    and other depredations, we shall attack the said Warwick and\r\n    Clarence on the sea as pirates, and all who aid them as is needful\r\n    for the protection of our lands and subjects.\r\n\r\n    \"Written at Middelburg in Zealand, June 20, 1470.\"[13]\r\n\r\n    \"Tell Monsieur de Warwick that the king will assist him to recover\r\n    England either with the help of Queen Margaret or by whatever\r\n    other means he may propose.... Only let him communicate his\r\n    desires in this respect as speedily as possible and the king will\r\n    lay aside all other affairs for the purpose of accomplishing it,\"\r\n\r\nwrote the complaisant King of France in his directions to the\r\nconfidential messenger sent to discuss matters with the English\r\nearl.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut that was not his language towards his cousin of Burgundy, whom he\r\nassured that there should be no infringement of their treaty, and that\r\nit was greatly to his royal displeasure that Flemish property\r\ncaptured at sea in defiance of that treaty should be sold in French\r\nmarket-places. There is a hot correspondence,[15] that is, it is hot\r\non the side of Charles, while Louis's phrases are smoothly surprised\r\nat there being any cause for dissatisfaction. The circumstances shall\r\nbe investigated, his cousin satisfied, etc. One letter from the duke\r\nto two of Louis's council is emphatic in its expressions of doubt as\r\nto the good faith of these royal statements:\r\n\r\n    \"ARCHBISHOP AND YOU ADMIRAL:\r\n\r\n    \"The vessels which you assure me are destined by the king for\r\n    an attack on England have attempted nothing except against my\r\n    subjects; but, by St. George, if some redress be not seen to, I\r\n    will take the matter into my own hands without waiting for your\r\n    motions, tardy and dilatory as they are.\"[16]\r\n\r\n\r\nReprisals were made accordingly, and the innocent French merchants,\r\ncoming peaceably to the fair at Antwerp, suffered confiscation of\r\ntheir private property, while the duke felt fully justified in\r\nstationing his fleet off the coast of Normandy to guard the Channel.\r\nPhilip de Commines was one of the company who went at the duke's\r\nbehest to Calais to urge the governor, Wenlock, to be faithful to King\r\nEdward, and to give no shelter to the rebellious earl and his protégé\r\nClarence.[17]\r\n\r\nLouis feared an outbreak of hostilities at an inconvenient moment. He\r\ntemporised. To Warwick, he denied a personal interview, but at the\r\nsame time he sent him a confidential emissary, Sr. du Plessis, to whom\r\nhe wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur du Plessis, you know the desire I have for Warwick's\r\n    return to England, as well because I wish to see him get the\r\n    better of his enemies--or that at least through him the realm of\r\n    England may be embroiled--as to avoid the questions which have\r\n    arisen out of his sojourn here.... For you know that these Bretons\r\n    and Burgundians have no other aim than to find a pretext for\r\n    rupturing peace and reopening the war, which I do not wish to see\r\n    commenced under this colour.... Wherefore I pray you take pains,\r\n    you and others there, to induce Mons. de Warwick to depart by all\r\n    arguments possible. Pray use the sweetest methods that you can, so\r\n    that he shall not suspect that we are thinking of anything else\r\n    but his personal advantage.\"[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo gain time was Louis's ardent wish at that moment. The envoys\r\nsent by Louis to placate the duke's resentment at the incidents in\r\nconnection with the Warwick affair, and to assure him that Louis meant\r\nwell by him and his subjects, found Charles holding high state at St.\r\nOmer. When they were admitted to audience, the duke was discovered\r\nsitting on a lofty throne, five feet above floor level, \"higher than\r\nwas the wont of king or emperor to sit.\" His hat remained on his head\r\nas the representatives of his feudal overlord bowed to him and he\r\nacknowledged their obeisance by a slight nod and a gesture permitting\r\nthem to rise.\r\n\r\nHugonet, a member of the ducal council, answered their address with\r\na prosy speech. Burgundian officials revelled in grandiloquent\r\nphrases--which this time bored Charles, He cut short the harangue\r\nimpatiently, took the floor himself, and made a statement of the\r\ninjuries he had suffered. Louis had promised to be his friend, but he\r\nwas aiding the foe of the duke's brother. The envoys repeated their\r\nsovereign's offers of redress. Charles declared that redress was\r\nimpossible. Pained, very pained were the French envoys to think that\r\na petty dispute could not be settled amicably. \"The king desires to\r\navoid friction. He offers you friendship, peace, and redress for every\r\nwrong. It will not be his fault if trouble ensue. Monseigneur, the\r\nking and you have a judge who is above you both.\"\r\n\r\nThe insinuation that it was he who was ready to break the peace\r\ninfuriated Charles. He started to his feet, his eyes flashing with\r\nfire. \"Among us Portuguese there is a custom that when our friends\r\nbecome friends to our foes we send them to the hundred thousand devils\r\nof hell.\"[19] \"A piece of bad taste to send by implication a king of\r\nFrance to a hundred thousand devils,\" comments the suave Chastellain,\r\naghast at this impolite, emphatic, though indirect reference to Louis\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nEqually aghast were the Burgundian courtiers present at this occasion.\r\nAfter all, they, too, were French by nature. To wreck the new-made\r\npeace for the sake of the English alliance, which had never been\r\nreally popular among them, that seemed an act of rash unwisdom.\r\n\r\n    \"A murmur went the rounds of the ducal suite because their chief\r\n    thus implied contempt for the name of France to which the duke\r\n    belonged. Not going quite so far as to call himself English,\r\n    though that was what his heart was, he boasted of his mother,\r\n    ancient friend of England and enemy of France.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, times when the duke was more emphatic in asserting\r\nhis English blood. Plancher cites a scrap of writing in his own hands\r\nwhich probably belonged to a letter to the magistrates and citizens of\r\nCalais, whom he addresses, \"O you my friends.\"[20] While reiterating\r\nthat he simply must defend his own state he adds, \"By St. George who\r\nknows me to be a better Englishman and more anxious for the weal of\r\nEngland than you other English ... [you] shall recognise that I am\r\nsprung from the blood of Lancaster,\" etc. His claims of kinship varied\r\nwith the circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhile he was so conscious of his own greatness, present and future,\r\nand of his own laudable intentions to do well by his subjects, it is\r\nquite possible, too, that Charles was puzzled more or less consciously\r\nby his failure to win popularity. For he was quite as unpopular with\r\nhis courtiers as with his subjects. The former did not like the rigid\r\ncourt rules. There was no pleasure in sitting through audiences silent\r\nand stiff \"as at a sermon,\" and exposed to personal reprimands from\r\ntheir chief if there were the slightest lapses from his standard of\r\nconduct. They did not know on what meat the duke was feeding his\r\nimagination, an imagination that already saw him as Cæsar. Had he\r\nactually attained the loftier rank that he dreamed of, his premature\r\narrogance might have been forgotten, but his pride of glory invisible\r\nto the world about him was undoubtedly a bar to his popularity during\r\nthe years 1470-73.\r\n\r\nBefore this pompous scene passed at St. Omer, Louis had been relieved\r\nof anxiety in regard to the stability of his kingdom, and the dangers\r\nof an heir like his brother who might easily be used as a tool by some\r\nclever faction opposed to the ruling monarch. On June 10th, a son was\r\nborn to him, afterwards Charles VIII. of France. Complaisant still\r\nwere his words to his Burgundian cousin, but the moment was drawing\r\nnear when his efforts to circumvent him were no longer secret.\r\n\r\nThe embassy returned home. Possibly their report of the duke's\r\npassionate words goaded the king into discarding his mask of\r\nfriendship. At any rate, his next steps were unequivocal in showing\r\nwhich side of the fresh English quarrel he meant to espouse. Margaret\r\nof Anjou hated the Earl of Warwick, not only because he had unseated\r\nher husband but because he had doubted her fidelity to that husband.\r\nNevertheless, under Louis's persuasions, she consented to forget her\r\npast wrongs and to stake her future hopes on fraternising with him on\r\na basis of common hate for Edward IV. The alliance was to be sealed\r\nby the marriage of young Edward of Lancaster, the prince whose very\r\nlegitimacy Warwick had questioned, with the earl's younger daughter.\r\nIt was a singular union to be accepted by the parents, separated as\r\nthey had been by the wall of insults interchanged during more than a\r\ndecade of bitter enmity.\r\n\r\nLouis brought his cousin to this step of concession. She saw her\r\nseventeen-year-old son betrothed to the sixteen-year-old Anne Neville,\r\nand later she herself swore reconciliation to Warwick on a piece of\r\nthe true cross in St. Mary's Church at Angers (August 4, 1470).\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur du Plessis [wrote Louis XI. on July 25th], I have sent\r\n    you Messire Ivon du Fou, to put the affairs of Monsieur de Warwick\r\n    in surety, and I order him to make such arrangements that the\r\n    people of the said M. de Warwick will suffer no necessity until he\r\n    is there. To-day we have made the marriage of the Queen of England\r\n    and of him, and hope to-morrow to have all in readiness to\r\n    depart.\"[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDAL OF CHARLES, DUKE OF BURGUNDY (FROM BARANTE)]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the king kept agents in all the Somme towns, insinuating\r\nopposition to the duke, and reminding the citizens that they were\r\nFrench at heart. His ambassadors passed in and out of the Burgundian\r\ncourt, saying many things in secret besides those they said in public.\r\nPlenty there were that wished for war, remarks the observant Commines.\r\nNobles like St. Pol and others could not maintain the same state in\r\npeace as in war, and state they loved. In time of war four hundred\r\nlances attended the constable, and he had a large allowance to\r\nmaintain them from which he reaped many a profitable commission\r\nbesides the fees of his office and his other emoluments. \"Moreover,\"\r\nadds Commines, \"the nobles were accustomed to say among themselves\r\nthat if there were no battles without, there would be quarrels within\r\nthe realm.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter of the grants to Charles of France had been settled to his\r\nroyal brother's liking, not to that of his Burgundian ally. Champagne\r\nand Brie, so cheerfully promised at Peronne, were withdrawn and\r\nGuienne substituted. When Normandy had been exchanged for Champagne\r\nand Brie, as it was arranged at Peronne, Charles of Burgundy approved\r\nthe change as he thought it assured him an obedient friend as\r\nneighbour.[22] The second change, Guienne instead of Champagne and\r\nBrie, was quite a different thing.\r\n\r\nGuienne bordered the Bay of Biscay far away from Burgundy. Naturally,\r\nCharles was not content. Then, too, it looked as though he had lost a\r\nuseful friend as well as a neighbour, for the new Duke of Guienne was\r\nformally reconciled to his brother and took oath that his fraternal\r\ndevotion to his monarch should never again waver.\r\n\r\nLong before Charles was completely convinced that Louis was not going\r\nto maintain the humble attitude assumed at Peronne and Liege, he\r\nbecame very suspicious that intrigues were on foot against him. \"He\r\nhastened to Hesdin where he entered into jealousy of his servants\"\r\nsays Commines. That he was assured that there were reasons for his\r\napprehensions appears in an epistle circulated as an open letter,[23]\r\nto various cities, wherein he makes a detailed statement of the plots\r\nagainst his life by one Jehan d'Arson and Baldwin, son of Duke Philip.\r\n\r\nSorry return was this from one recognised as Bastard of Burgundy and\r\nbrought up in the ducal household. Further, one Jehan de Chassa,\r\nCharles's own chamberlain, had taken French leave of the duke's\r\nservice and made his way to the king in his castle of Amboise, where\r\nhe had been pleasantly received and promised rich reward when he had\r\n\"executed his damnable designs against our person.\"\r\n\r\nMessengers sent by this Chassa to Baldwin in Charles's court at St.\r\nOmer were arrested as suspicious, and that circumstance frightened\r\nBaldwin and caused him to take to his heels, leaving his retinue, his\r\nhorses, and his baggage behind. He dreaded lest he might be attainted\r\nand convicted of treason, and therefore he took shelter with the king.\r\n\r\n    \"Saved from this conspiracy by the goodness and clemency of God,\r\n    we inform you of the events so that you may render thanks\r\n    by public processions, solemn masses, sermons, and prayers,\r\n    beseeching Him devoutly and from the heart that He will always\r\n    guard and defend our person, our lands, seigniories, and subjects\r\n    from such plots.\r\n\r\n    \"May God protect you, dear subjects. Written in our castle of\r\n    Hesdin, December 13, 1470.\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES.\r\n\r\n    \"LE GROS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Charles had less reason to fear French\r\n\"subtleties.\" At an assembly of notables[24] convened at Tours at the\r\nend of 1470, Louis dropped the mask of friendship worn uneasily for\r\njust two years, and made an open brief of his grievances against the\r\nduke.\r\n\r\nHis case was cited with a luxury of detail more or less authentic. The\r\ninterview at Peronne was a simple trap conceived by Balue and the Duke\r\nof Burgundy. The treaties of 1465 and 1468, both obtained by undue\r\npressure, had not been respected by Charles, etc. The assembly was\r\nobedient to suggestion. It was a packed house.\r\n\r\nEven Commines shows that it is not surprising that there was\r\nunanimity[25] in the declaration that according to God and his\r\nconscience in all honour and justice the king was released from those\r\ntreaties, and the way was paved for an invasion into Picardy as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nCharles's public accusations of plots against him did not go\r\nunanswered. Jehan de Chassa promptly issued a rejoinder:\r\n\r\n    \"As Charles, soi-disant Duke of Burgundy, has sent to divers\r\n    places letters signed by himself and his secretary, Jehan le\r\n    Gros, written at Hesdin, December 13th, falsely charging me with\r\n    plotting against his life with Baldwin, Bastard of Burgundy,\r\n    and Jehan d'Arson, I, considering that it is matter touching my\r\n    honour, feel bound to reply.... By God and by my soul I declare\r\n    that these charges against me made by Charles of Burgundy are\r\n    false and disloyal lies\"[26]\r\n\r\nBaldwin, too, expressed righteous indignation at the slur on his\r\ncharacter, but he remained in the French court as did many others who\r\nhad formerly served Charles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Earl of Warwick, having left his daughter in the hands\r\nof Margaret of Anjou, openly aided by Louis, sailed back to England in\r\nSeptember But there had been one further change of base of which the\r\nearl was still unconscious. His elder son-in-law had not rejoiced in\r\nthe Warwick-Lancaster alliance. It brought young Prince Edward to the\r\nfore, and bereft the Duke of Clarence--long ready to replace Edward of\r\nYork--of any immediate prospects. Therefore he was inclined to accept\r\noffers of a reconciliation tendered him by King Edward.\r\n\r\nDespite his secret change of heart, Clarence sailed with Warwick and\r\njoined with him in the proclamations scattered over England, declaring\r\nthat the exiles were returning to \"set right and justice to their\r\nplaces, and to reduce and redeem for ever the realm from its\r\nthraldom.\" Never a mention of either Edward IV. or Henry VI. Perhaps\r\nit was as convenient to see which way the wind blew and to put in a\r\nname accordingly.\r\n\r\nOn landing, however, \"King Henry VI.\" was raised as a cry. In\r\nNottinghamshire, where Edward lay, not a word was heard for York.\r\nThere was no conflict. Edward felt that Fate had turned against him\r\nand off he rode to Lyme with a small following, took ship, and made\r\nfor Holland. It was stormy, pirates from the Hanseatic towns gave\r\nchase, and glad was Edward to take shelter at Alkmaar where De la\r\nGroothuse, Governor of Holland, welcomed him in the name of the\r\nduke.[27] Edward was quite destitute. He had nothing with which to pay\r\nhis fare across the Channel but a gown lined with marten's fur, and as\r\nfor his train, never so poor a company was seen.\r\n\r\nEleven days later, Warwick was master of all England and official\r\nbusiness was transacted in the name of Henry VI., \"limp and helpless\r\non his throne as a sack of wool.\" He was a mere shadow and pretence\r\nand what was done in his name was done without his will or knowledge.\r\n\r\nCharles of Burgundy did not hasten to greet his unbidden guest. He\r\nwould rather have heard that his brother-in-law were dead, but he bade\r\nGroothuse show him every courtesy and supply him with necessaries and\r\nfive hundred crowns a month for luxuries. After a time, and perhaps\r\ninformed by weather prophets that the Lancastrian wind blowing over in\r\nEngland was but a fickle breeze, he consented to forget his hereditary\r\nsympathies.\r\n\r\n    \"The same day that the duke received news of the king's arrival in\r\n    Holland, I was come from Calais to Boulogne (where the duke then\r\n    lay) ignorant of the event and of the king's flight.[28] The duke\r\n    was first advised that he was dead, which did not trouble him much\r\n    for he loved the Lancaster line far better than that of York.\r\n    Besides he had with him the Dukes of Exeter and of Somerset and\r\n    divers others of King Henry's faction, by which means he thought\r\n    himself assured of peace with the line of Lancaster. But he feared\r\n    the Earl of Warwick, neither knew he how to content him that was\r\n    to come to him, I mean King Edward, whose sister he had married\r\n    and who was also brother-in-arms, for the king wore the Golden\r\n    Fleece and the duke the Garter.\r\n\r\n    \"Straightway then the duke sent me back to Calais accompanied by\r\n    a gentleman or two of this new faction of Henry, and gave me\r\n    instructions how to deal with this new world, urging me to\r\n    go because it was important for him to be well served in the\r\n    matter.[29] I went as far as Tournehem, a castle near to Guisnes,\r\n    and then dared not proceed because I found people fleeing for fear\r\n    of the English who were devastating the country.... Never before\r\n    had I needed a safe-conduct for the English are very honourable.\r\n    All this seemed very strange to me for I had never seen these\r\n    mutations in the world.\"\r\n\r\nCommines was uncertain as to what he had better do and wanted\r\ninstructions. \"The duke sent me a ring from his finger, bidding me go\r\nforward with the promise that if I were taken prisoner he would redeem\r\nme.\" New surprises met the envoy at Calais. None of the well-known\r\nfaces were to be seen. \"Further, upon the gate of my lodgings and\r\nthe very door of my chamber were a hundred white crosses and rhymes\r\nsignifying that the King of France and Earl of Warwick were one--all\r\nof which seemed strange to me.\" Well received was Commines and\r\nentertained at dinner. It was told at table how within a quarter of an\r\nhour after the arrival of news from England every man wore this livery\r\n(the ragged staff of Warwick), so speedy and sudden was the change.\r\n\"This is the first time that I ever knew how little stable are these\r\nmundane affairs.\"\r\n\r\n    \"In all communications that passed between them and me, I repeated\r\n    that King Edward was dead, of which fact I said I was well\r\n    assured, notwithstanding that I knew the contrary, adding further\r\n    that though it were not so, yet was the league between the Duke of\r\n    Burgundy and the king and realm of England such that this accident\r\n    could not infringe it--whomever they would acknowledge as king him\r\n    would we recognise.... Thus it was agreed that the league should\r\n    remain firm and inviolate between us and the king and realm of\r\n    England save that for Edward we named Henry.\"\r\n\r\nCommines explains further that the wool trade was what made amity with\r\nEngland necessary to Flanders and Holland, \"which is the principal\r\ncause that moved the merchants to labour earnestly for peace.\"\r\n\r\nCharles made vague promises to his uninvited guest, declaring\r\nostentatiously that his blood was Lancastrian. Nevertheless he\r\nfinally consented to an interview with him of York, in spite of the\r\nremonstrances of the Lancastrians, Somerset and Exeter. \"The duke\r\ncould not tell whom to please and either party he feared to displease.\r\nBut in the end, because sharp war was upon him face to face, he\r\ninclined to the English dukes, accepting their promises against the\r\nEarl of Warwick, their ancient enemy.\" King Edward, \"who was on the\r\nspot and very ill at ease,\" was quieted by secret assurances that the\r\nduke was obliged to dissimulate. \"Seeing that he could not keep the\r\nking but that he was bound to return to England and fearing for divers\r\nconsiderations altogether to discontent him, Charles pretended that he\r\ncould not aid the king and forbade his subjects to enter his service.\"\r\nPrivately, however, he gave him fifty thousand florins of St. Andrew's\r\ncross, and had two or three ships fitted out at Vere in Zealand, a\r\nharbour where all nations were received. Besides this he secretly\r\nhired fourteen well appointed \"ships of the Easterlings, which\r\npromised to serve him till he landed in England and for fifteen days\r\nafter, \"great aid considering the times.\"\r\n\r\nKing Edward departed out of Flanders in the year 1471, when the\r\nDuke of Burgundy went to wrest Amiens and St. Quentin back from the\r\nking.[30] \"The said duke thought now howsoever the world went in\r\nEngland he could not speed amiss because he had friends on both\r\nsides.\"[31]\r\n\r\nEdward's adventures in England proved that he had not lost his hold\r\nthere. Warwick's extraordinary brief success was but a flash in the\r\npan. London opened her gates and then the pitched battle at Barnet\r\ngave a final verdict between the rival Houses which England accepted.\r\nThis battle was fought on April 14th, when the thick fog and the like\r\nspeech of the two bodies caused hopeless confusion. Many friends slew\r\neach other unwittingly, and among the slain was the indefatigable,\r\nenergetic Warwick who had hoped to play with his royal puppets. Only\r\nforty-four was he and worthy of a better and more statesmanlike\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nOn that same day Margaret of Anjou and her son landed at Weymouth.\r\nHearing of Warwick's death, they tried to reach Wales but were\r\nintercepted and forced to fight at Tewkesbury. Here the young prince,\r\ntoo, met his death. To Edward's direct command is attributed the\r\nmurder of the unfortunate Henry VI. in the Tower, which happened at\r\nabout the same time. The desolated Margaret of Anjou lingered five\r\nyears under restraint in England before she was ransomed by King\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir John Paston to Margaret Paston. Wreten at London the\r\n    Thorysdaye in Esterne weke, 1471.\r\n\r\n    \"God hathe schewyd Hym selffe marvelouslye lyke Hym that made all\r\n    and can undoo agayn whare Hym lyst.\"[32]\r\n\r\nCharles of Burgundy could now pride himself on his foresight. His\r\nbrother of the two Orders was himself again.\r\n\r\n    \"The very day on which this fight happened [says Commines] the\r\n    Duke of Burgundy, being before Amiens, received letters from\r\n    the duchess his wife, that the King of England was not at all\r\n    satisfied with him, that he had given his aid grudgingly and as if\r\n    for very little cause he would have deserted him. To speak plainly\r\n    there never was great friendship between them afterwards. Yet the\r\n    Duke of Burgundy seemed to be extremely pleased at this news and\r\n    published it everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nA transaction of his own of this time, the duke did not publish. It\r\nwas a procedure perhaps justified by these wonderful \"mutations in the\r\nworld\" which impressed Commines as strange and terrible. The Duke of\r\nBurgundy caused a legal document to be drawn up attesting his own\r\nheirship to Henry VI. of England, and filed the same in the Abbey of\r\nSt. Bertin with all due formality. If there came more \"mutations\"\r\nin the world whose very existence was a new experience to Philip de\r\nCommines, Charles was ready to interpose his own plank in the new\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nIn the archives of the House of Croy in the château of Beaumont, rests\r\nthis document, which was duly signed by Charles on November 3, 1471,\r\nin his own hand \"so that greater faith\" be given to the statement\r\nthat no one was truer heir to the Lancaster House than Charles of\r\nBurgundy.[33] Two canons attested the instrument as notaries, and the\r\nwitnesses were Hugonet, Humbercourt, and Bladet.\r\n\r\nIt was expressly stipulated that if there were any delay in the duke's\r\nentering upon his English inheritance--which devolved to him\r\nthrough his mother,--a delay caused by motives of public utility of\r\nChristendom, and of the House of Burgundy, this should not prejudice\r\nhis rights or those of his successors. A mere deferring of assuring\r\nthe titles, etc., brought no prejudice to his rights. His delay ended\r\nin his death and Edward IV. never had to combat this claim of the\r\nbrother-in-law who had helped him, though grudgingly, to regain his\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Meyer is the earliest historian to tell this story and it\r\nis vouched for by no existing contemporary evidence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: From Henry VI.-Henry VII. the English throne was twice\r\nlost and twice regained by each of the rival Houses of York and\r\nLancaster.

From Amboise, Louis made a\r\nspecial pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Celles at Poitiers to breathe in\r\npious solitude his own prayers of thanksgiving for the happy event.\r\nThe battle of Tewkesbury stemmed the course of this abundant stream of\r\ngratitude, and there were other thanksgivings.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1471, Edward IV. was dating complacent letters from\r\nCanterbury to his good friends at Bruges,[2] acknowledging their\r\nvaluable assistance to his brother Charles,[3] recognising his part in\r\nrestoring Britain's rightful sovereign to his throne. To his sister,\r\nthe Duchess of Burgundy, the returned exile gave substantial proof\r\nof his gratitude in the shape of privileges in wool manufacture and\r\ntrade.[4]\r\n\r\nLike one of the alternating figures in a Swiss weather vane the King\r\nof England had swung out into the open, pointing triumphantly to fair\r\nweather over his head, while Louis was forced back into solitary\r\nimpotence. He seemed singularly isolated. His English friends were\r\ngone, his nobles were again forming a hostile camp around Charles of\r\nFrance, now Duke of Guienne, who had forgotten his late protestations\r\nof fraternal devotion, and there were many indications that the\r\nAnglo-Burgundian alliance might prove as serious a peril to France as\r\nit had in times gone by but not wholly forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe two most important of the disputed towns on the Somme were,\r\nhowever, in Louis's possession, and Charles of Burgundy, ready to\r\nreduce Amiens by siege on March 10, 1471, consented to stay his\r\nproceedings by striking a truce which was renewed in July. This\r\nafforded a valuable respite to the king, and he busied himself in\r\nenergetic efforts to detach his brother from the group of malcontents.\r\nVarious disquieting rumours about the prince's marriage projects\r\ncaused his royal brother deep anxiety, and induced him to despatch a\r\nspecial envoy to Guienne. To that envoy Louis wrote as follows[5]:\r\n\r\n    \"MONSEIGNEUR DU BOUCHAGE:\r\n\r\n    \"Guiot du Chesney[6] has brought me despatches from Monsg. de\r\n    Guienne and Mons. de Lescun and has, further, mentioned three\r\n    points to me: First, in behalf of Mme. de Savoy,[7] ... second, in\r\n    regard to M. d'Ursé ... third, touching the mission of Mons. de\r\n    Lescun to marry Monsg. of Guienne to the daughter of Monsg. de\r\n    Foix.... The Ursé matter I will leave to you, and will agree to\r\n    what you determine upon. On the spot you will be a better judge of\r\n    what I ought to say and what would be advantageous to me, than I\r\n    can here.\r\n\r\n    \"In regard to the third point, the Foix marriage, you know what a\r\n    misfortune it would be to me. Use all your five senses to prevent\r\n    it. I am told that my brother does not really like the idea, and\r\n    it has occurred to me that Mons. de Lescun has brought him to\r\n    consent in order to further the marriage of the duchess,[8] so\r\n    that in taking the sister, the duke will be relieved of this sum,\r\n    a condition that would please him greatly because he has nothing\r\n    to pay it with. I would prefer to pay both it and all the\r\n    accompanying claims and then be through with it. In effect, I beg\r\n    you make him agree to another [bride] before you leave, and do not\r\n    be in any hurry to come to me. If this Aragon affair[9] can be\r\n    arranged you will place me in Paradise.\r\n\r\n    \"_Item._ I have thought that Monsg. de Foix would not approve this\r\n    Aragon girl, because he himself has some hopes of the kingdom of\r\n    Aragon through his wife.

For he has informed me through this\r\n    man that the duke [of Brittany] has paid no attention to the\r\n    representations made him in my behalf, through Corguilleray,\r\n    and since my brother himself confides this to me, you have an\r\n    opportunity to assure him that I thank him, and that I never\r\n    cherish him so highly as when he tells me the truth, and that I\r\n    now recognise that he does not desire to deceive me, since he\r\n    does not spare the duke [of Brittany] and that, since he sees him\r\n    opposed to me, he should return the seal that you know of and\r\n    refuse to take his sister [Eleanor de Foix, the sister of the\r\n    Duchess of Brittany], or to enter into any other league.\r\n\r\n    \"If he will choose a wife quite above suspicion, as long as I live\r\n    I will harbour no misgiving of him and he shall be as puissant in\r\n    all the realm of France as I myself, as long as I live.

While he was infinitely\r\nanxious to prevent her alliance with his brother, he made overtures to\r\nbetroth her to his baby son, while he reminded her father in touching\r\nphrases that he, Louis, was Mary's loving godfather and hence exactly\r\nthe person to be her father-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1471-72 was filled with attempts to make terms between\r\nthe king and the duke before the termination of the truce. The king\r\nwas very hopeful of attaining this good result, and sweetly trustful\r\nof the duke's pacific and friendly intentions. He sternly refused to\r\nlisten to suggestions that Charles meant to play him false and was\r\nvery definite in his expressions of confidence. The following epistle\r\nto his envoys at the duke's court was an excellent document to fall by\r\nchance into Burgundian hands[11]:\r\n\r\n    \"To MONSIEUR DE CRAON AND PIERRE D'ORIOLE:\r\n\r\n    \"My cousin and monseigneur the general, I received your letters\r\n    this evening at the hostelry of Montbazon where I came because I\r\n    have not yet dared to go to Amboise.[12] When I imparted to you\r\n    the doubts that I had heard, it was not with the purpose of\r\n    delaying you in completing your business but only to advise you of\r\n    the dangers that were in the air. And to free you from all doubts\r\n    I assure you, that if Monseigneur of Burgundy is willing to\r\n    confirm, by writing or verbally, the terms which we arranged at\r\n    Orleans[13], I wish you to accept it and to clinch the matter and\r\n    I am quite determined to trust to it. As to your suspicion that\r\n    he may wish to make the chief promises in private letters without\r\n    putting it in a formal shape, you know that I agreed to it by a\r\n    pronotary, and when I have once accepted a thing I never withdraw\r\n    my decision.\r\n\r\n    \"My cousin and you monseigneur the general, see to it that\r\n    Monseigneur of Burgundy gives you adequate assurance of the\r\n    letters that he is to issue. When I once have the letter such as\r\n    we agreed upon and he is bound, I do not doubt that he will keep\r\n    faith. If my life were at stake, I am resolved to trust him. Do\r\n    not send me any more of your suspicions for I assure you that my\r\n    greatest worldly desire is that the matter be finished, since he\r\n    has given verbal assurance that he wishes me well. You write that\r\n    the pronotary told you that I was negotiating in every direction.\r\n    By my faith, I have no ambassador but you, and by the words that\r\n    Monseigneur of Burgundy said to you you can easily solve the\r\n    question, for he has only offered you what he mentioned before\r\n    when the matters were discussed. It looks to me as though they\r\n    were not free from traitors since they have Abbé de Begars and\r\n    Master Ythier Marchant.[14]\r\n\r\n    \"A herald of the King of England came here on his way to Monsg. of\r\n    Burgundy, who asked for a safe conduct to send a messenger to me\r\n    for this truce. Since your departure the council thought I ought\r\n    not to give any pass for more than forty days except to merchants.\r\n    If it please God and Our Lady that you may conclude your mission,\r\n    I assure you that as long as I live I will have no embassy either\r\n    large or small without immediately informing Monsg. of Burgundy\r\n    and I will only answer as if through him. I assure you that until\r\n    I hear from you whether Monsg. of Burgundy decides to conclude\r\n    this treaty or not as we agreed together, I will make no agreement\r\n    with any creature in the world and of that you may assure him.\r\n\r\n    \"Written at Montbazon, December 11th (1471).\r\n\r\n    \"Loys.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time Louis did not neglect friendly intercourse with the\r\ntowns he proposed to cede.\r\n\r\n    \"To the inhabitants of Amiens in behalf of the king: \"Dear and\r\n    beloved, we have heard reports at length from Amiens and we are\r\n    well content with you.... Give credence to all my messengers say.\r\n    We thank you heartily for all that you and your deputies have done\r\n    in our cause.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Burgundian court the duke's friends thought that he would play\r\nthe part of wisdom did he keep an army within call, and refrain from\r\nimplicitly trusting the king's promises. There was, moreover, an\r\nimpression abroad that the latter was not in a position to be very\r\nformidable.\r\n\r\n    \"Once [says Commines][15] I was present when the Seigneur d'Ursé\r\n    [envoy from the Duke of Guienne] was talking in this wise and\r\n    urging the duke to mobilise his forces with all diligence. The\r\n    duke called me to a window and said, 'Here is the Seigneur d'Ursé\r\n    urging me to make my army as big as possible, and tells me that we\r\n    would do well for the realm. Do you think that I should wage a war\r\n    of benefit if I should lead my troops thither?' Smiling I answered\r\n    that I thought not and he uttered these words: 'I love the welfare\r\n    of France more than Mons. d' Ursé imagines, for instead of the one\r\n    king that there is I would fain see six.'\"\r\n\r\nThe animus of this expression is clear. It implies a wish to see the\r\nduke's friends, the French nobles, exalted, Burgundy at the head,\r\nuntil the titular monarch had no more power than half a dozen of his\r\npeers. Yet Commines states in unequivocal terms that Charles's next\r\nmoves were to disregard his friendship for the peers, to discard their\r\nalliance, and to sign a treaty with Louis whose terms were wholly\r\nto his own advantage and implied complete desertion of the allied\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n    \"This peace did the Duke of Burgundy swear and I was present[16]\r\n    and to it swore the Seigneur de Craon and the Chancellor of\r\n    France[17] in behalf of the king. When they departed they advised\r\n    the duke not to disband his army but to increase it, so that the\r\n    king their master might be the more inclined to cede promptly the\r\n    two places mentioned above. They took with them Simon de Quingey\r\n    to witness the king's oath and confirmation of his ambassadors'\r\n    work. The king delayed this confirmation for several days.\r\n    Meanwhile occurred the death of his brother, the Duke of Guienne\r\n    ... shortly afterwards the said Simon returned, dismissed by the\r\n    king with very meagre phrases and without any oath being taken.\r\n    The duke felt mocked and insulted by this treatment and was very\r\n    indignant about it.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThis story involves so serious a charge against Charles of Burgundy\r\nthat the fact of his setting his signature to the treaty has been\r\nindignantly denied. Certain authorities impugn the historian's\r\ntruthfulness rather than accept the duke's betrayal of his friends. It\r\nis true that only a few months later than this negotiation, Commines\r\nhimself forsook the duke's service for the king's, a change of base\r\nthat might well throw suspicion on his estimate of his deserted\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nYet it must be remembered that he does not gloss over Louis's actions,\r\neven though he had an admiration for the success of his political\r\nmethods, methods which Commines believed to be essential in dealing\r\nwith national affairs. In many respects he gives more credit to the\r\nduke than to the king even while he prefers the cleverer chief. That\r\nthere is no documentary evidence of such a treaty is mere negative\r\nevidence and of little importance.\r\n\r\nThe fact seems fairly clear that Charles of Burgundy was at a parting\r\nof the ways, in character as in action. His natural bent was to tell\r\nthe truth and to adhere strictly to his given word. He felt that he\r\nowed it to his own dignity. He felt, too, that he was a person to\r\ncommand obedience to a promise whether pledged to him by king or\r\ncommoner. In the years 1469-1472 several severe shocks had been dealt\r\nhim. He had lost all faith in Louis, a faith that had really been\r\nfounded on the duke's own self-esteem, on a conviction that the weak\r\nking must respect the redoubtable cousin of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThe effect on Charles of his suspicions was to make him adopt the\r\ntools used by his rival, or at least to attempt to do so. At the\r\nmoment of the negotiation of 1471-1472, the duke's preoccupation\r\nwas to regain the towns on the Somme. That accomplished, it is not\r\nprobable that he would have abandoned his friends, the French\r\npeers, whom he desired to see become petty monarchs each in his own\r\nterritory. There seems no doubt that words were used with singular\r\ndisregard of their meaning. It is surprising that time was wasted in\r\nconcocting elaborate phrases that dropped into nothingness at the\r\nslightest touch. In citing the above passage from Commines referring\r\nto the treaty, the close of the negotiations has been anticipated.\r\nWhether or not any draft of a treaty received the duke's signature,\r\nthe king's yearning for peace ceased abruptly when his brother's death\r\nfreed him from the dread of dangerous alliance between Charles of\r\nFrance and Charles of Burgundy. As late as May 8th, he was still\r\nuncertain as to the decree of fate and wrote as follows to the\r\nGovernor of Rousillon[19]:\r\n\r\n    \"Keep cool for the present I implore you. If the Duke of Burgundy\r\n    declares war against me, I will set out immediately for that\r\n    quarter [Brittany], and in a week we will finish the matter. On\r\n    the other hand, if peace be made we shall have everything without\r\n    a blow or without any risk of restoration. However, if you can get\r\n    hold of anything by negotiating and manoeuvring, why do it. As\r\n    to the artillery, it is close by you, and when it is time, and I\r\n    shall have heard from my ambassador, you shall have it at once.\"\r\n\r\nTen days later he is more hopeful.[20]\r\n\r\n    \"Since my last letter to you I have had news that Monsieur de\r\n    Guienne is dying and that there is no remedy for his case. One\r\n    of the most confidential persons about him has advised me by a\r\n    special messenger that he does not believe he will be alive a\r\n    fortnight hence.... The person who gave me this information is\r\n    the monk who repeated his Hours with M. de G[uienne.] I am much\r\n    abashed at this and have crossed myself from head to foot.\r\n\r\n    \"Written at Moutils-lès-Tours, May 18th.\"\r\n\r\nThis prognostic was correct. In less than a fortnight the Duke of\r\nGuienne lay dead, and the heavy suspicion rested upon his royal\r\nbrother of having done more than acquiesce in the decree of fate.\r\nWhether or not there was any truth in this charge the king was\r\ncertainly not heartbroken by the loss. Indeed, the event interested\r\nhim less than the question of making the best use of the remainder of\r\nhis truce with Charles. The following letters to Dammartin and the\r\nDuke of Milan belong to this time.\r\n\r\n    \"Thank you for the pains you have taken but pray, as speedily as\r\n    you can, come here to draw up your ordinance for we only have\r\n    a fortnight more of the truce. I have sent the artillery and\r\n    soldiers to Angers. Monsg. the grand master, strengthen Odet's\r\n    forces, do not let one man go, and see to it that the seneschal of\r\n    Guienne enrols sufficient to fill his company. Then if there are\r\n    more at large, form them into a body and send them to me and I\r\n    will find them a captain and pay all those who are willing to\r\n    stay.\r\n\r\n    \"As to him,[21] make him talk on the way and learn whether he\r\n    would like to enter into an agreement in his brother's name, and\r\n    work it so that the duke will leave the Burgundian in the lurch at\r\n    all points for ever, and make a good treaty, as you will know how,\r\n    for I do not believe that the Seigneur de Lescun left here for any\r\n    other reason than to attempt to make an arrangement of some kind.\r\n\r\n    \"Now monseigneur the grand master, you are wiser than I and will\r\n    know how to act far better than I can instruct you, but, above\r\n    all, I implore you come in all haste for without you we cannot\r\n    make an ordinance.\r\n\r\n    \"Written at Xaintes, May 28th.\r\n\r\n    \"LOYS.\"[22]\r\n\r\n    \"AMBOISE, June 7th.\r\n\r\n    \"Loys, by the grace of God, King of France. Beloved brother and\r\n    cousin, we have received the letters you have written making\r\n    mention, as you have heard, that in the truce lately concluded\r\n    between us and the Duke of Burgundy up to April 1st next coming,\r\n    which will be the year 1473, the Duke of Burgundy has mentioned\r\n    you as his ally, which you do not like because you never asked the\r\n    Duke of Burgundy to do so, and you do not know whether he made\r\n    this statement on the advice of the Venetian ambassador who is\r\n    with him.\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, and because you do not mean to enter into alliance or\r\n    understanding with the Duke of Burgundy but wish to remain\r\n    our confederate and ally and have sworn to that effect before\r\n    notaries, and sealed your oath with your seal ... that you are no\r\n    ally of the Duke of Burgundy and that you renounce and repudiate\r\n    his nomination as such ... also you may be certain that on our\r\n    part we are determined to maintain all friendship between us and\r\n    you ... and if we make any treaty in the future we will expressly\r\n    include you in it and never will do otherwise.\"[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Monseigneur the grand master, I am advised how while the truce is\r\n    still in being, the Duke of Burgundy has taken Nesle and slain all\r\n    whom he found within. I must be avenged for this. I wished you to\r\n    know so that if you can find means to do him a like injury in his\r\n    country you will do it there and anywhere that you can without\r\n    sparing anything. I have good hopes that God will aid in avenging\r\n    us, considering the murders for which he is responsible within the\r\n    church and elsewhere, and because by virtue of the terms of their\r\n    surrender [they thought] they had saved their lives.\r\n\r\n    \"Done at Angers, June 19th.\r\n\r\n    \"P.S.--If the said place had been destroyed and rased as I ordered\r\n    this never would have happened. Therefore, see to it that all such\r\n    places be rased to the ground, for if this be not done the people\r\n    will be ruined and there will be an increase of dishonour and\r\n    damage to me.\"[24]\r\n\r\nOne fact stated by Louis in this letter was true. Charles of Burgundy\r\nbroke the truce when it had but two weeks to run, and thus put\r\nhimself in the wrong. The death of Guienne made him wild with anger.\r\nApparently he had not believed in the imminence of the danger,\r\nalthough he had been constantly informed of the progress of the\r\nprince's illness. But to his mind, it was the hand of Louis, not the\r\njudgment of God, that ended the life of the prince.\r\n\r\n    \"On the morrow, which was about May 15, 1472, so far as I remember\r\n    [says Commines] came letters from Simon de Quingey, the duke's\r\n    ambassador to the king, announcing the death of the Duke of\r\n    Guienne and that the king had recovered the majority of his\r\n    places. Messages from various localities followed headlong one on\r\n    the other, and every one had a different story of the death.\r\n\r\n    \"The duke being in despair at the death, at the instigation of\r\n    other people as much concerned as himself, wrote letters full of\r\n    bitter accusations against the king to several towns--an action\r\n    that profited little for nothing was done about it.[25]... In this\r\n    violent passion the duke proceeded towards Nesle in Vermandois,\r\n    and commenced a kind of warfare such as he had never used before,\r\n    burning and destroying wherever he passed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note how smoothly Commines sails by the capital\r\ncharges against the king. He neither accepts nor denies the king's\r\ncrime, while frankly admitting that Guienne's decease was an opportune\r\ncircumstance for Louis. He apologises for mentioning any evil report\r\nof either king or duke, but urges his duty as historian to tell the\r\ntruth without palliation.\r\n\r\nNesle was a little place on a tributary of the Somme which refused\r\nthe duke's summons to surrender, sent to it on June 10th. It seems\r\npossible that there was a misunderstanding between the citizens\r\nand the garrison which resulted in the slaughter of the Burgundian\r\nheralds. Whereupon, the exasperated soldiers rushed headlong upon the\r\nill-defended burghers and wreaked a terrible vengeance on the town.\r\n\r\nWhen the duke arrived on the spot, the carnage was over, but he was\r\nunreproving as he inspected the gruesome result. Into the great church\r\nitself he rode, and his horse's hoofs sank through the blood lying\r\ninches deep on the floor. The desecrated building was full of\r\ndead--men, women, and children--but the duke's only comment as he\r\nlooked about was, \"Here is a fine sight. Verily I have good butchers\r\nwith me,\" and he crossed himself piously.\r\n\r\n    \"Those who were taken alive were hanged, except some few suffered\r\n    to escape by the compassionate common soldiers. Quite a number had\r\n    their hands chopped off. I dislike to mention this cruelty but I\r\n    was on the spot and needs must give some account of it.\"[26]\r\n\r\nThe story of the duke's treatment of the innocent little town of Nesle\r\nis painted in colours quite as lurid as the king's murder of his\r\nbrother. There is some ground for the denunciations of Charles,\r\nbut the gravest accusation, that the duke promised clemency to the\r\ncitizens on surrender and then basely broke his word, does not deserve\r\ncredence. He was in a state of exasperation and the horrors were\r\ncommitted in passion, not in cold blood.[27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURGUNDIAN STANDARD PRESERVED AT BEAUVAIS]\r\n\r\nIt is delightful to note the king's virtuous indignation at his\r\ncousin's proceedings, coupled with his regrets that he himself had not\r\ndestroyed the town.\r\n\r\nWith the terrible report of the events at Nesle flying before his\r\nadvance guard, Charles went on towards Normandy. Roye he gained\r\neasily, and then, passing by Compiègne where \"Monseigneur the grand\r\nmaster\" had intrenched himself, and Amiens with the good burghers whom\r\nLouis delighted to honour, he marched on until he reached Beauvais, an\r\nold town on the Thérain. Some of the garrison from the fallen Roye had\r\ntaken refuge there, but the place was weak in its defences, not even\r\nhaving its usual garrison or cannon, as it happened.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his first expectation of picking the town like a\r\ncherry, Charles sat down before it. The siege that followed won\r\na reputation beyond the warrant of its real importance from the\r\nextraordinary tenacity and energy of the people in their own defence.\r\nEvery missile that the ingenuity of man or woman could imagine was\r\nused to drive back the besiegers when the town was finally invested.\r\n\r\nFrom June 27th to July 9th Charles waited, then an assault was\r\nordered. Charles laughed at the idea of any serious resistance. \"He\r\nasked some of his people whether they thought the citizens would wait\r\nfor the assault. It was answered yes, considering their number even if\r\nthey had nothing before them but a hedge.\"[28] He took this as a joke\r\nand said, \"To-morrow you will not find a person.\" He thought that\r\nthere would be a simple repetition of his experience at Dinant and\r\nLiege, and that the garrison would simply succumb in terror. When the\r\nBurgundians rushed at the walls their reception showed not only that\r\nevery point had a defender, but also that those same defenders were\r\nprovided with huge stones, pots of boiling water, burning torches--all\r\nmost unpleasant things when thrown in the faces of men trying to scale\r\na wall. Three hours were sufficient to prove to the assailants the\r\ndifficulty of the task. Twelve hundred were slain and maimed, and the\r\nstrength of the place was proven.\r\n\r\nCharles was not inclined to relinquish his scheme, but the weather\r\ncame to the aid of the besieged. Heavy rains forced the troops to\r\nchange camp. More men were lost in skirmishes and mimic assaults,\r\nlosses that Charles could ill afford at the moment. Finally at the end\r\nof three fruitless weeks, the siege was raised and the Burgundians\r\nmarched on to try to redeem their reputation in Normandy. Had Beauvais\r\nfallen, it would have been possible to relieve the Duke of Brittany,\r\nagainst whom Louis had marched with all his forces and whom he had\r\nenveloped as in a net. This reverse was the first serious rebuff that\r\nhad happened to Charles, and it marked a turn in his fortunes.\r\n\r\nLouis fully appreciated the enormous advantage to himself, and was not\r\nstinting in his reward to the plucky little town. Privileges and a\r\nreduction of taxes were bestowed on Beauvais. An annual procession\r\nwas inaugurated in which women were to have precedence as a special\r\nrecognition of their services with boiling water and other irregular\r\nweapons, while a special gift was bestowed on one particular girl,\r\nJeanne Laisné, who had wrested a Burgundian standard from a soldier\r\njust as he was about to plant it on the wall. Not only was she endowed\r\nfrom the royal purse, but she and her husband and their descendants\r\nwere declared tax free for ever.[29]\r\n\r\n_Charles to the Duke of Brittany_\r\n\r\n    \"My good brother, I recommend myself to you with good heart. I\r\n    rather hoped to be able to march through Rouen, but the whole\r\n    strength of the foe was on the frontier, where was the _grand\r\n    master, of whose loyalty I have not the least doubt_, so that the\r\n    project could not be effected. I do not know what will happen.\r\n    Realising this, I have given subject for thought elsewhere and\r\n    I have pitched my camp between Rouen and Neufchâtel, intending,\r\n    however, to return speedily. If not I will exploit the war in\r\n    another quarter more injurious to the enemy, and I will exert\r\n    myself to keep them from your route. My Burgundians and\r\n    Luxemburgers have done bravely in Champagne. I know, too, that you\r\n    have done well on your part, for which I rejoice. I have burned\r\n    the territory of Caux in a fashion so that it will not injure you,\r\n    nor us, nor others, and I will not lay down arms without you, as\r\n    I am certain you will not without me. I will pursue the work\r\n    commenced by your advice at the pleasure of Our Lord, may He give\r\n    you good and long life with a fruitful victory.\r\n\r\n    \"Written at my camp near Boscise, September 4th.\r\n\r\n    \"Your loyal brother,\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThe duke's course was marked by waste and devastation from the\r\nwalls of Rouen to those of Dieppe, but nothing was gained from this\r\ndesolation. By September, keen anxiety about his territories led him\r\nto fear staying so far from his own boundaries, and he decided to\r\nreturn. Through Picardy he marched eastward burning and laying waste\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nHardly had he turned towards the Netherlands, when Louis marched into\r\nBrittany against his weakest foe. There was no fighting, but Francis\r\nfound it wise to accept a truce. Odet d'Aydie, who had ridden in hot\r\nhaste to Brittany, scattering from his saddle dire accusations of\r\nfratricide against Louis--this same Odet became silenced and took\r\nservice with the king.[31] When reconcilations were effected, most\r\nkind to the returning ally or servant did Louis always show himself.\r\n\r\nOn November 3d, a truce was struck between Louis and Charles, which,\r\nlater, was renewed for a year. But never again did the two men come\r\ninto actual conflict with each other, though they were on the eve of\r\ndoing so in 1475.\r\n\r\nThe period of the great coalitions among the nobles was at an end.\r\nCharles of France was dead and so, too, were others who were strong\r\nenough to work the king ill. The Duke of Brittany showed no more\r\nenergy. When again within his own territories, Charles of Burgundy\r\nbecame absorbed in other projects which he wished to perfect before he\r\nagain measured steel with Louis.\r\n\r\n  \"The Duke of Berry, he is dead,\r\n  Brittany doth nod his head,\r\n  Burgundy doth sulky sit,\r\n  While Louis works with every wit.\"[32]\r\n\r\nSuch was the tenor of a doggerel verse sung in France, a verse that\r\nprobably never came to Charles's ears--though Louis might have\r\nlistened to it cheerfully.\r\n\r\nInfinitely disastrous were the events of that summer to Charles of\r\nBurgundy. Not only had he lost in allies, not only had he squandered\r\nlife and money uselessly in his reckless expedition over the north of\r\nFrance, but his own retinue was diminished and weakened by the men\r\nwhom Louis had succeeded in luring from his service. The loss that\r\nCharles suffered was not only for the time but for posterity. Among\r\nthose convinced that there was more scope for men of talent in France\r\nthan in Burgundy was that clever observer of humanity who had been at\r\nCharles's side for eight years. In August of 1472, Philip de Commines\r\ntook French leave of his master and betook himself to Louis, who\r\nevidently was not surprised at his advent.\r\n\r\nThe historian's own words in regard to this change of base are\r\nlaconic: \"About this time I entered the king's service (and it was\r\nthe year 1472), who had received the majority of the servitors of his\r\nbrother the Duke of Guienne. And he was then at Pont de Cé.\"[33] This\r\npassing from one lord to another happened on the night between the 7th\r\nand 8th of August, when the Burgundian army lay near Eu.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of the departure was probably due to the duke's\r\ndiscovery of his servant's intentions not yet wholly ripe, and those\r\nintentions had undoubtedly been formed at Orleans, in 1471, when\r\nCommines made a secret journey to the king. On his way back to\r\nBurgundy, he deposited a large sum of money at Tours. Evidently he\r\ndid not dare put this under his own name, or claim it when it was\r\nconfiscated as the property of a notorious adherent of Louis's\r\nfoe.[34]\r\n\r\nWhen the fugitive reached the French court, however, he was amply\r\nrecompensed for all his losses.[35] For, naturally, at his flight, all\r\nhis Burgundian estates were abandoned.[36] It was at six o'clock on\r\nthe morning of August 8th that the deed was signed whereby the duke\r\ntransferred to the Seigneur de Quiévrain all the rights appertaining\r\nto Philip de Commines, \"which rights together with all the property of\r\nwhatever kind have escheated to us by virtue of confiscation because\r\nhe has to-day, the date of this document, departed from our obedience\r\nand gone as a fugitive to the party opposed to us.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThere are various surmises as to the cause of this precipitate\r\ndeparture. Not improbable is the suggestion that Charles often\r\noverstepped the bounds of courtesy towards his followers. Once, so\r\nruns one story, he found the historian sleeping on his bed where he\r\nhad flung himself while awaiting his master. Charles pulled off one of\r\nhis boots \"to give him more ease\" and struck him in the face with it.\r\nIn derision the courtiers called Commines _tête bottée_, and their\r\nmocking sank deep into his soul.\r\n\r\nContemporary writers make little of the chronicler's defection.\r\nThese crossings from the peer's to the king's camp were accepted\r\noccurrences. But by Charles they were not accepted. There is\r\na vindictive look about the hour when he disposes of his late\r\nconfidant's possessions, only explicable by intense indignation not\r\nitemised in the deed approved by the court of Mons.[38]\r\n\r\nMore loyal was that other chronicler, Olivier de la Marche, though to\r\nhim, also, came intimations that he would find a pleasant welcome at\r\nthe French court. He, too, had opportunities galore to make links with\r\nLouis. The accounts teem with references to his secret missions\r\nhere and there, and with mention of the rewards paid, all carefully\r\nitemised. So zealous was this messenger on his master's commissions,\r\nthat his hackneys were ruined by his fast riding and had to be sold\r\nfor petty sums. The keen eye of Louis XI. was not blind to the quality\r\nof La Marche's services, and he thought that they, too, might be\r\ndiverted to his use.[39]\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur du Bouchage, Guillaume de Thouars has told me that\r\n    Messire Olivier de la Marche is willing to enter my service and\r\n    I am afraid that there may be some deception. However, there is\r\n    nothing that I would like better than to have the said Sieur\r\n    de Cimay, as you know. Therefore, pray find out how the matter\r\n    stands, and if you see that it is in good earnest work for it with\r\n    all diligence. Whatever you pledge I will hold to. Advise me of\r\n    everything.\r\n\r\n    \"Written at Cléry, October 16th [1472].\r\n\r\n    \"To our beloved and faithful councillor and chancellor, Sire du\r\n    Bouchage.\"[40]\r\n\r\nBut La Marche was not tempted, and was rewarded for his fidelity\r\nby high office in a duchy which, shortly after these events, was\r\n\"annexed\" to his master's domain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Journal de Jean de Roye_, i., 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Commynes-Dupont, iii., 202.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Plancher, iv., cccvi., May 28th.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Rymer, _Foedera_, xi., 735. _Pro Ducissa Burgundiæ super\r\nLana claccanda_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Lettres de Louis XI._, iv., 256.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: One of Guienne's retinue who, later, passed to Louis's\r\nservice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Louis's sister Yolande.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Duke of Brittany had married the third daughter of\r\nthe Count de Foix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: This was an allusion to a proposed marriage between\r\nGuienne and Jeanne, reputed daughter of Henry IV. of Castile.

The truth of the death is not proven. Frequent mentions\r\nof Guienne's condition occur through the letters of the winter '71-72.\r\nThe story was that the poison, administered subtly by the king's\r\norders, caused the illness of both the prince and his mistress, Mme.\r\nde Thouan. She died after two months of suffering, December 14th,\r\nwhile he resisted the poison longer, though his health was completely\r\nshattered and his months of longer life were unutterably wretched and\r\npainful, a constant torture until death mercifully released him in\r\nMay. Accusations of poisoning are often repeated in history. In this\r\ncase, there was certainly a wide-spread belief in Louis's guilt. In\r\nhis manifestos, (Lenglet, ii., 198) Charles declares that the king's\r\ntools in compassing his brother's death were a friar, Jourdain Favre,\r\nand Henri de la Roche, esquire of his kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe story told by Brantôme _(OEuvres Complètes_ de Pierre de\r\nBourdeille, Seigneur de Brantôme, ii., 329. \"Grands Capitaines\r\nFrancois.\" There is nothing too severe for Brantôme to say about Louis\r\nXI.) is very detailed. A fool passed to Louis's service from that of\r\nthe dead prince. While this man was attending his new master in the\r\nchurch of Notre Dame de Cléry, he heard him make this prayer to the\r\nVirgin: \"Ah! my good Lady, my little mistress, my great friend in whom\r\nI have always put my trust, I pray thee be a suppliant to God in my\r\nbehalf, be my advocate with Him so that He may pardon me for the death\r\nof my brother whom I had poisoned by this wicked Abbé of St. John. I\r\nconfess it to thee as to my good patron and mistress. But what was to\r\nbe done? He was a torment to my realm. Get me pardoned and I know well\r\nwhat I will give thee.\"\r\n\r\nBrantôme tells further that the fool, using the privilege of free\r\nspeech accorded to his class, talked about Guienne's death at dinner\r\nin public and after that day was never seen again. On the other hand,\r\nthe young duke's will was all to his brother's favour. Louis was\r\nmade executor and legatee, \"and if we have ever offended our beloved\r\nbrother,\" dictated the dying man, \"we implore him to pardon us as we\r\nwith _débonnaire_ affection pardon him.\" Mandrot, editor of Commynes\r\n(1901), i., 230, considers the whole story a malicious fabrication of\r\nOdet d'Aydie, and other authorities refer the cause to disease. The\r\nvery date of the death varies from May 12th to May 24th.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Commines, iii., ch. ix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: There is a curious document in existence (see _Bulletins\r\nde L'Hist. de France_, 1833-34) dated fifty years after the event.

The circumstances of the long-standing\r\nquarrel between Duke Arnold and his unscrupulous son Adolf were a\r\nscandal throughout Europe. In 1463, a seeming reconciliation of the\r\nparties had not only been effected but celebrated in the town of Grave\r\nby a pleasant family festival, from whose gaieties the elder duke,\r\nfatigued, retired at an early hour. Scarcely was he in bed, when he\r\nwas aroused rudely, and carried off half clad to a dungeon in the\r\ncastle of Buren, by the order of his son, who superintended the\r\nabduction in person and then became duke regnant. For over six years\r\nthe old man languished in prison, actually taunted, from time to time,\r\nit is said, by Duke Adolf himself.\r\n\r\nIndignant remonstrances against this conduct were heard from various\r\nquarters, and were all alike unheeded by the young duke until Charles\r\nof Burgundy interfered and ordered him to bring his father to his\r\npresence, and to submit the dispute to his arbitration. Charles was\r\ntoo near and too powerful a neighbour to be disregarded, and his\r\nperemptory invitation was accepted. Pending the decision, the\r\ntwo dukes were forced to be guests in his court, under a strict\r\nsurveillance which amounted to an arrest.\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion made by Charles was for a compromise between\r\nfather and son. \"Let Duke Arnold retain the nominal sovereignty in\r\nGuelders, actual possession of one town, and a fair income, while\r\nto Adolf be ceded the full power of administration.\" The latter was\r\nemphatic in his refusal to consider the proposition. \"Rather would I\r\nprefer to see my father thrown into a well and to follow him thither\r\nthan to agree to such terms. He has been sovereign duke for forty-four\r\nyears; it is my turn now to reign.\" Arnold thought it would be a\r\nsimple feat to fight out the dispute. \"I saw them both several times\r\nin the duke's apartment and in the council chamber when they pleaded,\r\neach his own cause. I saw the old man offer a gage of battle to his\r\nson.\"[1] The senior belonged to the disappearing age of chivalry. A\r\ntrial of arms seemed to him an easy and knightly fashion of ending his\r\ndifferences with his importunate heir.\r\n\r\nNo settlement was effected before the French expedition, but Charles\r\nwas not disposed to let the matter slip from his control, and when\r\nhe proceeded to Amiens, the two dukes, still under restraint, were\r\nobliged to follow in his train. At a leisure moment Charles intended\r\nto force them to accept his arbitration as final. Before that moment\r\narrived, the more agile of the two plaintiffs, Adolf, succeeded in\r\neluding surveillance and escaping from the camp at Wailly. He made his\r\nway successfully to Namur disguised as a Franciscan monk. Then, at\r\nthe ferry, he gave a florin when a penny would have sufficed. The\r\nliberality, inconsistent with his assumed rôle, aroused suspicion and\r\nled to the detection of his rank and identity. He was stayed in his\r\nflight and imprisoned in the castle of Namur to await a decision on\r\nhis case by his self-constituted judge. This was not pronounced until\r\nthe summer of 1473.\r\n\r\nBy that time, Charles was resolved on another course of action than\r\nthat of adjusting a family dispute in the capacity of puissant,\r\nimpartial, and friendly neighbour. Adolf's behaviour towards his\r\nfather had been extraordinarily brutal and outrageous. Public comment\r\nhad been excited to a wide degree. It was not an affair to be dealt\r\nwith lightly by Duke Charles. The young Duchess of Guelders was\r\nCatharine of Bourbon, sister to the late Duchess of Burgundy, and\r\nAdolf himself was chevalier of the Golden Fleece. In consideration of\r\nthese links of family and knightly brotherhood, Charles desired that\r\nthe case should be tried with all formality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARNOLD, DUKE OF GUELDERS (FROM THE ENGRAVING BY\r\nPINSSIO, AFTER THE DRAWING BY J. ROBERT)]\r\n\r\nOn May 3, 1473, an assembly of the Order was held at Valenciennes,[2]\r\nand the knights were asked to pass upon the conduct of their\r\ndelinquent fellow, who was permitted to present his own brief through\r\nan attorney, but was detained in his own person at Namur. The\r\ninnocence or guilt of his prisoner was no longer the chief point of\r\ninterest as far as the Duke of Burgundy was concerned. The latter had\r\nmade an excellent bargain on his own behalf with the moribund Duke of\r\nGuelders, who had signed (December, 1472) a document wherein he sold\r\nto Charles all his administrative rights in Guelders and Zutphen for\r\nninety-two thousand florins,[3] in consideration of Arnold's enjoying\r\na life interest in half of the revenue of his ancient duchy. That\r\nclause soon lost its significance. The old man's life ceased in March,\r\n1473, and, by virtue of the contract, Charles proposed to enter into\r\nfull possession of his estates, setting aside not only Adolf, whom he\r\nwas ready to pronounce an outlawed criminal, quite beyond the pale of\r\nsociety, but that Adolf's innocent eight-year-old heir, Charles, whose\r\nhereditary claims had also been ignored by his grandfather.\r\n\r\nBefore the knights of the Order as a final court, were rehearsed all\r\nthe circumstances of the old family quarrel and of the late commercial\r\ntransaction. Their verdict was the one desired by their chief. It was\r\nproven to their entire satisfaction that Arnold's sale of the duchy of\r\nGuelders and Zutphen was a legitimate proceeding, and that the deed\r\nexecuted by him was a perfect and valid instrument, whereby Charles of\r\nBurgundy was duly empowered to enjoy all the revenues of, and to exert\r\nauthority in, his new duchy at his pleasure. As to Duke Adolf, he\r\nwas condemned by this tribunal of his peers to life imprisonment as\r\npunishment for his unfilial and unjustifiable cruelty towards Arnold,\r\nlate Duke of Guelders.\r\n\r\nAdolf's protests were stifled by his prison bars, but the people of\r\nGuelders were by no means disposed to accept unquestioned this deed\r\nof transfer, made when the two parties to the conveyance were in\r\nvery unequal conditions of freedom. In order to convince them of the\r\njustice of his pretensions, Charles levied a force almost as efficient\r\nas his army of the preceding summer, and fell upon Guelders. A truce,\r\na triple compact with France and England, had recently been renewed,\r\nso that for the moment his hands were free from complications, an\r\nevent commented upon by Sir John Paston, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"April 16, 1473, CANTERBURY.\r\n\r\n    \"As for tydings ther was a truce taken at Brusslys about the xxvi\r\n    day off March last, betwyn the Duke of Burgoyn and the Frense\r\n    Kings inbassators and Master William Atclyff ffor the king heer,\r\n    whiche is a pese be londe and be water tyll the ffyrst daye off\r\n    Apryll nowe next comyng betweyn Fraunce and Ingeland, and also the\r\n    Dukys londes. God holde it ffor ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer had recently been in Charles's court. Writing from Calais\r\nin February, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"As ffor tydyngs heer ther bee but few saff that the Duke of\r\n    Burgoyen and my Lady hys wyffe fareth well. I was with them on\r\n    Thorysdaye last past at Gaunt.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy was not the only pretender to the vacated\r\nsovereignty of Guelders. The Duke of Juliers was also inclined to\r\nurge his cause, were Adolf's family to be set aside. At the sight\r\nof Burgundian puissance, however, he was ready to be convinced, and\r\naccepted 24,000 florins for his acquiescence in the righteousness of\r\nthe accession. Several of the cities manifested opposition to Charles,\r\nbut yielded one after another. In Nimwegen--long hostile to Duke\r\nArnold--there was a determined effort to support little Charles of\r\nGuelders who, with his sister, was in that city. The child made a\r\npretty show on his little pony, and there were many declarations of\r\ndevotion to his cause as he was put forward to excite sympathy. For\r\nthree weeks, the town held out in his name. The resistance to the\r\nBurgundian troops was sturdy. When the gates gave way before their\r\nattacks the burghers defended the broken walls. Six hundred English\r\narchers were repulsed from an assault with such sudden energy that\r\nthey left their banners sticking in the very breaches they thought\r\nthey had won, fine prizes for the triumphant citizens. But the game\r\nwas unequal, and the combatants, convinced that discretion was the\r\nbetter part of valour, at last accepted the Duke of Cleves as a\r\nmediator with their would-be sovereign.\r\n\r\nOn July 19th, a long civic procession headed by the burgomasters,\r\nwearing neither hats nor shoes, marched to the Duke of Burgundy with a\r\nprayer for pardon on their lips. The leaders of the opposition to his\r\naccession were delivered over to the mercy of the victor. The garrison\r\nwere accorded their lives and a tax was imposed on the city to\r\nindemnify the duke for his needless trouble, and Guelders was added\r\n_de facto_ to the list of Burgundian ducal titles. In the various\r\nstate papers presently issued by the new ruler, the mention of the\r\ncircumstance of his accession to the sovereignty was simple and\r\nstraightforward, as in a certain document appointing Olivier de la\r\nMarche to be treasurer. The patent bears the date of August 18th and\r\nwas one of the earliest issued by Charles in this new capacity.\r\n\r\n    \"As by the death of the late Messire Arnold, in his life Duke of\r\n    Guelderland, these counties and duchy have lapsed to me, and by\r\n    the same token the offices of the land have escheated to our\r\n    disposition, and among others the office of master of the moneys\r\n    of those countships ... using the rights, etc., escheated to me,\r\n    and in consideration of the good and agreeable services already\r\n    rendered and continually rendered by our knight, etc., Olivier de\r\n    la Marche, having full confidence in his sense, loyalty, probity,\r\n    and good diligence--for these causes and others we entrust the\r\n    office of master and overseer of moneys of the land of Guelders\r\n    to him, with all the rights, duties, and privileges thereto\r\n    pertaining. In testimony of this we have set our seal to these\r\n    papers. Done in our city of Nimwegen, August 18, 1473. Thus signed\r\n    by M. le duc.\"\r\n\r\nOn the back of this document was written:\r\n\r\n    \"To-day, November 3, 1473, Messire Olivier de la Marche ... took\r\n    the oath of office of master and overseer of the land and duchy of\r\n    Guelders.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThe charge of the ducal children, Charles and Philippa, was entrusted\r\nto the duke who, in his turn, deputed Margaret of York to supervise\r\ntheir education. In a comparatively brief time agitation in behalf\r\nof the disinherited heir ceased, and imperial ratification alone was\r\nrequired to stamp the territory as a legal fraction of the Burgundian\r\ndomains. Under the circumstances the minor heirs were the emperor's\r\nwards, and it was his express duty to look to their interests, but\r\nFrederic III. showed no disposition to assert himself as their\r\nchampion. On the contrary, the embassy that arrived from his court on\r\nAugust 14th was charged with felicitations to his dear friend, Charles\r\nof Burgundy, for his acquisition, and with assurances that the\r\nrequisite investiture into his dignities should be given by his\r\nimperial hand at the duke's pleasure.[6]\r\n\r\nCommunication between Frederic and Charles had been intermittently\r\nfrequent during the past three years, and one subject of their letters\r\nwas probably a reason why Charles had been willing to abandon a losing\r\ngame in France to give another bias to his thoughts. He was lured\r\non by the bait of certain prospects, varying in their definite form\r\nindeed, but full of promise that he might be enabled, eventually, to\r\nconfer with Louis XI. from a better vantage ground than his position\r\nas first peer of France. The story of these hopes now becomes the\r\nstory of Charles of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nWhen Sigismund of Austria completed his mortgage, in 1469, at St.\r\nOmer, and returned home, as already stated, he was fired with zeal to\r\ndivert some of the dazzling Burgundian wealth into the empty imperial\r\ncoffers. An alliance between Mary of Burgundy and the young Archduke\r\nMaximilian seemed to him the most advantageous matrimonial bargain\r\npossible for the emperor's heir. He urged it upon his cousin with\r\nall the eloquence he possessed, and was lavish in his offers to be\r\nmediator between him and his new friend Charles.\r\n\r\nFrederic was impressed by Sigismund's enthusiastic exposition of the\r\nadvantages of the match, and little time elapsed before his ambassador\r\nbrought formal proposals to Charles for the alliance. The duke\r\nreceived the advances complacently and returned propositions\r\nsignificant of his personal ambitions. As early as May, 1470, his\r\ninstructions to certain envoys sent to the intermediary, Sigismund,\r\nare plain. In unequivocal terms, his daughter's hand is made\r\ncontingent on his own election as King of the Romans, that shadowy\r\nroyalty which veiled the approach to the imperial throne.\r\n\r\n    \"_Item_--And in regard to the said marriage, the ambassadors shall\r\n    inform Monseigneur of Austria that, since his departure from\r\n    Hesdin, certain people have talked to Monseigneur about this\r\n    marriage and mentioned that, in return, the emperor would be\r\n    willing to grant to Monseigneur the crown and the government of\r\n    the Kingdom of the Romans, with the stipulation that Monseigneur,\r\n    _arrived at the empire by the good pleasure of the emperor_ or\r\n    by his death, would, in his turn, procure the said crown of the\r\n    Romans for his son-in-law. The result will be that the empire\r\n    will be continued in the person of the emperor's son and his\r\n    descendants.\r\n\r\n    \"_Item_--They shall tell him about a meeting between the imperial\r\n    and ducal ambassadors, at which meeting there was some talk of\r\n    making a kingdom out of certain lands of Monseigneur and\r\n    joining these to an _imperial_ vicariate of all the lands and\r\n    principalities lying along the Rhine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following paragraphs of this instruction,[7] Charles directs\r\nhis envoys to make it clear to Monseigneur of Austria (Sigismund)\r\nthat the duke's interest in the plan does not spring from avarice or\r\nambition. He is purely actuated by a yearning to employ his time and\r\nhis strength for God's service and for the defence of the Faith, while\r\nstill in his prime.\r\n\r\nShould the emperor refuse to approve the duke's nomination as King of\r\nthe Romans, the ambassadors are instructed to say that they are not\r\nempowered to proceed with the marriage negotiations without first\r\nreferring to their chief. They must ask leave to return with their\r\nreport. If Sigismund should take it on himself to sound the emperor\r\nagain about his sentiments, the envoys might await the result of his\r\ninvestigations. He was to be assured that while Charles was resolved\r\nto hold back until he was fully satisfied on this point, if it were\r\nonce ceded, he would interpose no further delay in the celebration of\r\nthe nuptials. He must know, however, just what power and revenue the\r\nemperor would attach to the proposed title. He was not willing to\r\naccept it without emoluments. His present financial burdens were\r\nalready heavy, etc. The concluding items of the instructions had\r\nreference to the marriage settlements.\r\n\r\nA kingdom of his own was not the duke's dream at this stage of\r\nBurgundo-Austrian negotiations. The title that Charles desired\r\nprimarily was King of the Romans, one empty of substantial sovereign\r\npower, but rich with promise of the all-embracing imperial dignity.\r\nSignificant is the intimation that after this preliminary title was\r\nconferred, its wearer would be glad to have Frederic step aside\r\nvoluntarily. A resignation would be as efficient as death in making\r\nroom for his appointed successor.\r\n\r\nFrederic III. had, indeed, intimated occasionally that a life of\r\nmeditation would suit his tastes better than the imperial throne, but\r\nhe seems in no wise to have been tempted by the offer made by Charles\r\nto relieve him of his onerous duties, and then to pass on the office\r\nto his son. At any rate, the emperor rejected the opportunity to enjoy\r\nan irresponsible ease. His answer to the duke was that he did not\r\nexercise sufficient influence over his electors to ensure their\r\naccepting his nominee as successor to the _imperium_.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one honour that lay wholly within his gift. If\r\nCharles desired higher rank, the emperor would be quite willing to\r\nerect his territories into a realm and to create him monarch of\r\nhis own agglomerated possessions, welded into a new unity. This\r\nproposition wounded Charles keenly. He assured Sigismund[8] (January\r\n15, 1471) that his nomination as King of the Romans would never have\r\noccurred to him spontaneously. He had been assured that it was a\r\ndarling project of the emperor, and he had simply been willing\r\nto please him, etc. As to a kingdom of his own, he refused the\r\nproposition with actual disdain.\r\n\r\nThen various suitors for the hand of Mary of Burgundy appeared on\r\nthe scene successively. To Nicholas of Calabria, Duke of Lorraine,\r\ngrandson of old King René of Anjou, she was formally betrothed.[9]\r\n\r\n\"My cousin, since it is the pleasure of my very redoubtable seigneur\r\nand father, I promise you that, you being alive, I will take none\r\nother than you and I promise to take you when God permits it.\" So\r\nwrote Mary with her own hand on June 13, 1472, at Mons. On December\r\n3d, she declared all such pledges revoked as though they never had\r\nbeen made, and Nicholas, too, formally renounced his pretensions to\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nThere were several moments when Charles of France had appeared to be\r\nvery near acceptance as Mary's husband, and several other princes\r\nseemed eligible suitors. Doubtless her father found his daughter very\r\nvaluable as a means of attracting friendship. Doubtless, too, as\r\nCommines says, he was not anxious to introduce any son-in-law into his\r\nfamily. His fortieth year was only completed in 1473, and he was by no\r\nmeans ready to range himself as an ancestor.\r\n\r\nAt successive times the negotiations between Charles and Frederic were\r\nruptured only to be renewed on some slightly different basis. Threaded\r\ntogether they made a story fraught with interest for Louis XI., and\r\none that, very probably, he had an opportunity to hear. Up to August,\r\n1472, it is a safe inference that Philip de Commines was fully\r\ncognisant of the propositions and counter-propositions, the\r\nunderstandings and misunderstandings, the private letters of, as well\r\nas the interviews with, the accredited Austrian envoys that appeared\r\nat one Burgundian camp after another. Probably there was nothing more]\r\nvaluable in the store of learning carried by the astute historian from\r\nhis first patron to his second than all this fund of confidential\r\nmiscellany.\r\n\r\nIt seems a fair surmise that Louis XI. enjoyed immensely the\r\ndelightful private view into his rival's dreams, the disappointments\r\nand rehabilitation of his shattered visions. The relation would have\r\nmade him not only fully aware of the reasons why Charles was diverted\r\nfrom his hot pursuit of the Somme towns, but thoroughly informed as to\r\nthe great obstacles lying in the path which the duke hoped to travel.\r\nNaturally, the king was quite willing to rest assured that ruin was\r\ninevitable. If his rival were disposed to wreck himself rashly on\r\nGerman shoals, the king was equally disposed to be an acquiescent\r\nonlooker and to spare his own powder.\r\n\r\nOn his part, Charles was wholly unconscious of the extent of his loss\r\nof prestige within the French realm in 1472. There had been other\r\nperiods when the king had appeared triumphant over his aspiring nobles\r\nonly to be again checked by their alliance. In the radical change\r\nundergone by the feudatories after Guienne's death and Brittany's\r\nreconciliation, there was, however, no opening left for the Duke\r\nof Burgundy's re-entry as a French political leader. It was this\r\ndefinitive cessation of his importance that Charles failed to\r\nrecognise. Confident that his star was rising in the east he did\r\nnot note the significance of its setting in the west. Thereupon the\r\nsituation was,--Charles, believing that his plans were his own\r\nsecret, _versus_ Louis, fully advised of those plans and alert to all\r\nincidents of the past, present, and future in a fashion impossible to\r\nthe duke in his absorbed contemplation of his own prospects, blocking\r\nthe scope of his view.\r\n\r\nWith the emperor's congratulations at the duke's accession to\r\nGuelders, and his offers to invest him with the title, were coupled\r\nintimations that it was an opportune moment to resume consideration of\r\nan alliance between the Archduke Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy. The\r\nduke accepted the new overtures, and Rudolf de Soulz and Peter\r\nvon Hagenbach proceeded to the Burgundian and Austrian courts\r\nrespectively, as confidential envoys to discuss the marriage.[10]\r\n\r\nCharles was far more gracious to De Soulz than he had been to the\r\nlast imperial messenger, the Abbé de Casanova, who had restricted his\r\nproposals to Mary's fortunes and ignored her father's. The duke had no\r\nintention of permitting any conference to proceed on that line. He was\r\nexplicit as to his requisitions. De Soulz was surprised by a gift of\r\nten thousand florins, explained by the phrase, \"because Monseigneur\r\nrecognised the love and affection borne him by the said count.\" That\r\nwas a simple retainer. Other benefits, offices, and estates were\r\nconferred, to take effect on the day when Monseigneur was named King\r\nof the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to Hagenbach were definite, covering the ground\r\nof those previously mentioned, issued in 1470. He was, however,\r\nespecially enjoined to assure Frederic that the duke did not require\r\nhis abdication. He would be content to step into the shoes naturally\r\nvacated by his death.\r\n\r\nThe final suggestion resulting from these parleyings was that an\r\ninterview between the two principals would be far more satisfactory\r\nthan any further interchange of messages. It was not only a propitious\r\ntime for a conference, but it was necessary. The ceremony of\r\ninvestiture of the duke into his latest acquired fief made it\r\nevidently imperative that he should visit the emperor. And to\r\npreparations for that event, Charles turned his attention, now\r\nabsolutely confident that the outcome must be to his satisfaction. He\r\nhad as little comprehension of the character of the man with whom he\r\nwas to deal as he had of Louis XI. The choice of a place caused some\r\ndifficulty, each prince preferring a locality near his own frontier.\r\nMetz was selected and abandoned on account of an epidemic. Finally\r\nTrèves was appointed for the important occasion, and Frederic sent\r\nofficial invitations to the princes of the empire to follow him\r\nthither in October.\r\n\r\nIllustration: MARY OF BURGUNDY (AFTER THE DESIGN BY C. LAPLANTE)]\r\n\r\nBefore Charles arrived at the rendezvous, another event had occurred\r\nthat had an important bearing on his fortunes. Nicholas, Duke of\r\nLorraine, died (July 27th), leaving no direct heir. He had been\r\nrelinquished as a son-in-law, but the geographical position of his\r\nduchy made the question of its sovereignty all important to Charles of\r\nBurgundy. If it could be under his own control, how convenient for\r\nthe passage of his troops from Luxemburg to the south! The taste for\r\nduchies like many another can grow by what it feeds upon.\r\n\r\nPrepared to set out for his journey to Trèves, Charles hastened his\r\nmovements and proceeded to Metz with an escort so large that it had a\r\nformidable aspect to the city fathers. Whether they feared that their\r\nfree city was too tempting a base for attack on Lorraine or not, the\r\nmagistrates yet found it expedient to keep the Burgundian thousands\r\nwithout their walls. The emperor, too, was on his way to Trèves. Many\r\nof his suite were occupying quarters in Metz. Room might be found for\r\nCharles and his immediate retainers, indeed, but the troops must make\r\nthemselves as comfortable as possible outside the gates. So said the\r\nburgomaster, and Charles was forced to yield and he made a splendid\r\nentry into the town under the prescribed conditions.\r\n\r\nHis own paraphernalia had been forwarded from Antwerp, so that\r\nthere should be an abundance of plate, tapestry, etc., to grace his\r\ntemporary quarters, and the forests of Luxemburg had been scoured to\r\nsecure game for the banquets.\r\n\r\nIt was all very fine, but Charles was not in a humour to be pleased.\r\nHe was annoyed about his troops; very probably he had intended leaving\r\na portion at Metz, ready to be available in Lorraine if occasion\r\noffered. He cut short his stay in the town and marched on with his\r\nimposing escort to Trèves, whence he hoped to march out again a\r\ngreater personage than any Duke of Burgundy had ever been.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Commines, iv., ch. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Hist. de l'Ordre,_ etc., p. 64. One of the places to be\r\nfilled at this session was that of Frank van Borselen, the widower\r\nof Jacqueline, Countess of Holland. Thus the last faint trace of the\r\nancient family disappeared. It is expressly stated in the minutes of\r\nthe session that Adolf of Guelders was asked to nominate candidates\r\nfrom his prison, but he would not do it. Striking is Charles's remark\r\non the nomination of the son of the King of Naples. Considering that\r\nthe Order was already decorated and honoured by four kings, very\r\nexcellent, he judged it more _à propos_ to distribute the five empty\r\ncollars within his own states. Nevertheless the infant was elected, as\r\nwas also Engelbert of Nassau.\r\n\r\nVarious members are criticised as permitted by the rules of the Order.\r\nThere was reproach for Anthony the Bastard for taking a gift of 20,000\r\ncrowns from Louis XI. Payable as it was in terms, it savoured of a\r\npension. Had Henry van Borselen done all he could to prevent Warwick's\r\nlanding in England? etc.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor pieces of business discussed was the disposition of\r\nthe scarlet mantles now discarded by the chevaliers. It was decided\r\nafter deliberation that they should be sold and the proceeds applied\r\nto the purchase of tapestries for the chapel of Dijon, and the\r\ntreasurer was deputed to see about it. Perhaps it was in this\r\nconnection that the discussion turned on the wide-spread use, or\r\nrather abuse of gold and velvet. It tended to depreciate the Order and\r\nthe state of chivalry. But the sovereign thought it best to defer this\r\npoint until his return from his proposed journey to Guelders. Lengthy,\r\ntoo, were the discussions upon the exact usage in respect to wearing\r\nthe collar and insignia of the Order.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The first sum named was three hundred thousand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _The Paston Letters, iii., 79._.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See _Mémoires Couronnés_, xlix., 180.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Toutey, p. 42; Lenglet, ii., 207. August 14th the Duke\r\nof Burgundy crossed the Rhine and made his way to Nimwegen where the\r\nambassador of the emperor visited him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This instruction, printed by Lenglet (iii., 238) from the\r\nGodefroy edition of Commines, has no date and has been referred to\r\n1472. From internal evidence it seems fair to conclude that it belongs\r\nrather to 1470. The question of the marriage comes in at the end of\r\nthe paper, the first part being devoted to Swiss affairs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Toutey, p. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Lenglet, iii., 192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Toutey, p. 44; Chmel, _Monumenta Habsburgica, I, 3._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Toutey, p. 46.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING AT TRÈVES\r\n\r\n1473\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, September 28th, Emperor Frederic made his entry into the\r\nold Roman city on the dancing Moselle. Two days later, the Duke of\r\nBurgundy arrived and was welcomed most pompously outside of Trèves, by\r\nhis suzerain.\r\n\r\nAfter the first greetings, ensued an argument about the etiquette\r\nproper for the occasion, an argument similar to those which had\r\nabsorbed the punctilious in the Burgundian court, when the dauphin\r\nmade his famous visit to Duke Philip. For thirty minutes, the emperor\r\nargued with his guest before feudal scruples were overcome and the\r\nvassal was induced to ride by his chief's side into the city.\r\n\r\nThe entry was a grand sight, and crowds thronged the streets, more\r\ncurious about the duke than about the emperor. Charles was then in the\r\nvery prime of life. His personality commanded attention, but there\r\nwere some among the onlookers who found it more striking than\r\nattractive. One bystander thought that the very splendour of his\r\ndress, wherein cloth of gold and pearls played a part, only brought\r\ninto high relief the severity of his features. His great black eyes,\r\nhis proud and determined air failed to cast into oblivion a certain\r\neffect of insignificance given by his square figure, broad shoulders,\r\nexcessively stout limbs, and legs rather bowed from continuous\r\nriding.[l]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another word portrait of the duke as he looked in\r\nthe year 1473, whose trend is more sympathetic.[2] \"His stature was\r\nsmall and nervous, his complexion pale, hair dark chestnut, eyes black\r\nand brilliant, his presence majestic but stern. He was high-spirited,\r\nmagnanimous, courageous, intrepid, and impetuous. Capable of action,\r\nhe lacked nothing but prudence to attain success.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the two descriptions emerges a fairly clear picture of an\r\nenergetic man, somewhat undersized, and sometimes inclined to assert\r\nhis dignity in a fashion that did not quite comport with his physical\r\ncharacteristics. The conviction that he was a very important personage\r\nwith greater importance awaiting him, and his total lack of a sense of\r\nhumour, combined with his inability to feel the pulse of a situation,\r\nundoubtedly affected his bearing and made it seem more pompous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES THE BOLD IDEALISED BY RUBENS. IN THE IMPERIAL\r\nGALLERY AT VIENNA BY PERMISSION OF J.J. LOWY, VIENNA]\r\n\r\nThe emperor was not an heroic figure in appearance any more than he\r\nwas in the records of his reign, distinguished for being the feeblest\r\nas well as the longest in the annals of the empire. He was indolent,\r\ntimid, irresolute, and incapable. His features and manners were\r\nvulgar, his intellect sluggish. Peasant-like in his petty economies,\r\nhe was shrewder at a bargain than in wielding his imperial sceptre.\r\nAt Trèves he was accompanied by his son, the Archduke Maximilian, a\r\nfairly intelligent youth of eighteen, very ready to be fascinated by\r\nhis proposed father-in-law, who was a striking contrast to his own\r\nlanguid and irresolute father, in energy and strenuous love of action.\r\n\r\nAs the two princes rode together into the city, Charles's\r\naccoutrements attracted all eyes. The polished steel of his armour\r\nshone like silver. Over it hung a short mantle actually embroidered\r\nwith diamonds and other precious stones to the value of two hundred\r\nthousand gold crowns. His velvet hat, graciously held in his hand out\r\nof compliment to the emperor, was ornamented with a diamond whose\r\nprice no man could tell. Before him walked a page carrying his helmet\r\nstudded with gems, while his magnificent black steed was heavily\r\nweighted down with its rich caparisons.\r\n\r\nFrederic III., very simple in his ordinary dress, had exerted himself\r\nto appear well to his great vassal. His robe of cloth of gold\r\nwas fine, though it may have looked something like a luxurious\r\ndressing-gown, as it was made after the Turkish fashion and bordered\r\nwith pearls. The emperor was lame in one foot, injured, so ran the\r\ntradition, by his habit of kicking, not his servants, but innocent\r\ndoors that chanced to impede his way.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke Maximilian, gay in crimson and silver, walked by the side\r\nof an Ottoman prince, prisoner of war, and converted to Christianity\r\nby the pope himself. And then there was a host of nobles, great and\r\nsmall. Among them were Engelbert of Nassau[3] and the representative\r\nof the House of Orange-Châlons, whose titles were destined to be\r\nunited in one person within the next half-century.\r\n\r\nThe magnificence remained unrivalled in the history of royal\r\nconferences. The very troopers wore habits of cloth of gold over their\r\nsteel, while their embroidered saddle-cloths were fringed with silver\r\nbells. Surpassing all others, were the heralds-at-arms of the various\r\nindividual states which acknowledged Charles as their sovereign,\r\nseigneur, count, or duke as the case might be. They preceded their\r\nliege lord, clad in their distinctive armorial coats, ablaze with\r\ncolour. Before them were the trumpeters in white and blue, their very\r\ninstruments silvered, while first of all rode one hundred golden\r\nhaired boys, \"an angel throng.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so difficult to decide as to the requisite etiquette of escort,\r\nthat the emperor and duke agreed to separate on the fairly neutral\r\nground of the market-place. Each proceeded with his own suite to his\r\nlodgings, Frederic to the archbishop's palace, and Charles to\r\nthe abbey of St. Maximin, which had conferred on him, some years\r\npreviously, the honorary title of \"Protector.\" His army was quartered\r\nwithin and without the city. Two days for repose and then the first\r\nofficial interview took place, which is described as follows, by an\r\nunknown correspondent, evidently in the ducal suite:[4]\r\n\r\n    \"Yesterday, which was Sunday, Monseigneur waited upon the emperor\r\n    and escorted him to his own lodging which is in the abbey of St.\r\n    Maximin. My said lord was clad in ducal array except for his hat.\r\n    The emperor wore a rich robe of cloth of gold of cramoisy, and his\r\n    son was in a robe of green damask. As to their people, both suites\r\n    were very brave, jewelry and cloth of gold being as common as\r\n    satin or taffeta. Monseigneur received the emperor in a little\r\n    chamber decorated with hangings from Holland that many recognised.\r\n\r\n    \"The emperor made the Bishop of Mayence his mouthpiece to describe\r\n    the stress of Christianity and to urge Charles to lend his\r\n    assistance. Having listened to this address, Monseigneur requested\r\n    the emperor to please come into a larger place where more people\r\n    could hear his answer. Accordingly they entered a hall decorated\r\n    with the tapestry of Alexander, while the very ceiling was covered\r\n    with cloth of gold. There was a dais whereon stood a double row of\r\n    seats. Benches and steps were spread over with tapestry wrought\r\n    with my lord's arms. Thither came the emperor and mounted the dais\r\n    with difficulty.... Mons., the chancellor, clad in velvet over\r\n    velvet cramoisy, first pronounced a discourse in beautiful Latin\r\n    as a response to what had been said by the seigneur of Mayence.\r\n    Then, showing how the affairs of my said lord were affected by\r\n    the king, he began with an account of the king's reception by\r\n    Monseigneur, whom God absolve [evidently the late duke], in his\r\n    own residence, and he continued down to the present day, dilating\r\n    upon the great benefits, services, and honour by him [Louis]\r\n    received in the domains of Burgundy, and the extortions he had\r\n    made since and desires to make. Never a word was forgotten, but\r\n    all was well stated, especially the case of M. de Guienne.[5]\r\n    Finally, Monseigneur declared that if his lands were in security,\r\n    there was nothing he would like better than to give aid to\r\n    Christianity.\r\n\r\n    \"After this statement, which was marvellously honest, the emperor\r\n    arose from the throne, wine and spices were brought, and then\r\n    Monseigneur escorted the emperor to his quarters with grand\r\n    display of torches. This is the outline of what happened on\r\n    October 4th, in the said year lxxiii. And as to the future, next\r\n    Thursday the emperor will dine where Monseigneur lodges, _et là\r\n    fera les grants du roy_,[6] and there will be novelties. In regard\r\n    to the fashion of the said emperor and his estate, he is a very\r\n    fine prince and attractive, very robust, very human, and benign.\r\n    I do not know with whom to compare his figure better than\r\n    Monseigneur de Croy, as he was eight or ten years ago, except that\r\n    his flesh is whiter than that of the Sr. de Croy. The emperor has\r\n    seven or eight hundred horse as an escort, but the major part\r\n    of the nobles present come from this locality. In regard to\r\n    Monseigneur's departure, there is no news, and they make great\r\n    cheer--this is all for this time.\"\r\n\r\n    The German scholars in the imperial party listened most\r\n    attentively to the style of the Netherlander's speech as well as\r\n    to his subject-matter. \"More abundant in vocabulary than elegant\r\n    in Latinity,\" was their comment, a fault they considered marking\r\n    all French Latin. The audience found time to note the style for\r\n    the subject of the address did not interest them greatly. The\r\n    least observant onlooker knew that the main purpose of this\r\n    interview was not the plan of a Turkish campaign, though Frederic\r\n    appointed a committee to discuss that, whose members, Burgundian\r\n    and German in equal numbers, were instructed to study the Eastern\r\n    question while emperor and duke were absorbed in other matters.[7]\r\n    In their very first session, this committee decided that the\r\n    chief obstacle to a Turkish expedition was the Franco-Burgundian\r\n    quarrel. This point was also raised by Charles in his first\r\n    conference with Frederic. No campaign was feasible until the\r\n    European powers were ready to act in concert. Louis XI. was aiding\r\n    and abetting the heathen by being a disturbing element which\r\n    rendered this desired unity impossible. So Frederic appointed a\r\n    fresh commission to discuss European peace. And this insolvable\r\n    problem was a convenient blind for other discussions.\r\n\r\n    On October 5th, a Burgundian fête gave new occasion for a display\r\n    of wealth; \"vulgar ostentation,\" sneered the less opulent German\r\n    nobles who tried to show that their pride was not wounded by the\r\n    sharp contrasts between imperial habits and those of a mere duke.\r\n    On their side, the Burgundians remarked that it was a pity to\r\n    waste good things on boors so little accustomed to elegantly\r\n    equipped apartments that they used silken bedspreads to polish up\r\n    their boots!\r\n\r\n    A running commentary of international criticism, fine feasts,\r\n    ostensible negotiations about projects that probably no one\r\n    expected would come to pass, and an undercurrent, persistent\r\n    and mandatory, of demands emphatically made on one side, feebly\r\n    accepted by the other while the two principals were together, and\r\n    petulantly disliked by the emperor as soon as he was alone again\r\n    --such was the course of the conference.\r\n\r\n    Frederic III. had one simple desire--to marry his son to the\r\n    Burgundian heiress. Charles desired many things, some of which are\r\n    clear and others obscure. The very fact that the emperor did not\r\n    at once refuse his demands, gave him confidence that all were\r\n    obtainable. Very probably he hoped to overawe his feudal chief\r\n    by a display of his resources, and by showing the high esteem in\r\n    which he was held by all nations. There at Trèves, embassies came\r\n    to him from England, from various Italian and German states, and\r\n    from Hungary.\r\n\r\n    On October 15th, a treaty was signed that made the new Duke of\r\n    Lorraine virtually a vassal to Charles, an important step towards\r\n    Burgundian expansion. There was time and to spare for these many\r\n    comings and goings during the eight weeks of the sojourn at\r\n    Trèves, and the duke was not idle. That his own business hung\r\n    fire, he thought was due to the machinations of Louis XI. He had\r\n    no desire to prolong his visit, for he was well aware of the\r\n    risk involved in keeping his troops in Trèves.[8] At first the\r\n    magnificence of his equipage had amused the quiet old town, but\r\n    little by little, in spite of the duke's strict discipline, the\r\n    presence of idle soldiers became very onerous. Charles did not\r\n    hesitate to hang on the nearest tree a man caught in an illicit\r\n    act, but much lawlessness passed without his knowledge. Provisions\r\n    became very dear; there was some danger of an epidemic due to the\r\n    unsanitary conditions of the place, ill fitted to harbour so many\r\n    strangers. The precautions instituted by the Roman founders in\r\n    regard to their water supply had long since fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\n    Weary of delays, the duke demanded a definite answer from the\r\n    emperor as to the proposed kingdom, the matrimonial alliance, and\r\n    his own status. Frederic appeared about to acquiesce, and then\r\n    substituted vague promises for present assent to the demands. But\r\n    when Charles, indignant, broke off negotiations on October 31st,\r\n    and began to prepare for immediate departure, Frederic became\r\n    anxious, renewed his overtures, and a new conference took place,\r\n    in which he consented to fulfil the duke's wishes, with the\r\n    proviso the sanction of his election should be obtained.\r\n\r\n    Charles promised to go against the Turk in person, and to place\r\n    a thousand men at Frederic's disposal, so soon as all points at\r\n    issue between him and Louis XI. were settled, and provided that\r\n    his estates were erected into a kingdom, which should also\r\n    comprise the bishoprics of Liege, Utrecht, Toul, Verdun, and the\r\n    duchies of Lorraine, Savoy, and Cleves. This realm was to be\r\n    a fief of the empire like Hungary, Bohemia, and Poland, and\r\n    transmissible by heredity in the male and female line--a necessary\r\n    recognition of a woman's right, approved by both parties, for Mary\r\n    of Burgundy was to marry Maximilian.\r\n\r\n    Electoral confirmation alone was wanting, and in regard to that\r\n    there was much voluminous correspondence and much shuffling of\r\n    responsibility. The electors of Mayence and of Trèves were the\r\n    only ones present to speak for themselves, and they declared\r\n    that the matter ought to be referred to a full conclave of the\r\n    electoral college.[9] Let the candidate for royalty await the\r\n    decision of the next diet, appointed for November at Augsburg.\r\n\r\n    Never loth to delay, the emperor proposed this solution to\r\n    Charles, who replied haughtily that if his request were not\r\n    complied with he would join Louis XI. in a league hostile to the\r\n    empire. This was on November 6th. The Archbishop of Trèves then\r\n    suggested that if the question could not wait for a diet, at\r\n    least the electors should be summoned, especially the elector of\r\n    Brandenburg, whom he knew to be influential with the emperor, and\r\n    who was a leader in the anti-Burgundian and anti-Bohemian German\r\n    party. This seemed fair, but the emperor suddenly put on a show of\r\n    authority and declared, with an injured air, that he was perfectly\r\n    free to act on his own initiative without confirmation. In the\r\n    interests of Christianity and of the empire he would appoint\r\n    Charles of Burgundy chief of the crusade, and he would crown him\r\n    king.\r\n\r\n    The organised opposition to his plan came to the duke's ears and\r\n    made him very angry. Yet, at the same time, he had no desire\r\n    to dispense with electoral consent. Possibly he felt that the\r\n    imperial staff alone was too feeble to conjure his kingdom into\r\n    permanent existence. It was finally decided that Frederic III.\r\n    should display his power to the extent of investing Charles\r\n    at once with the duchy of Guelders, while the more important\r\n    investiture should be postponed.\r\n\r\n    Very imposing was the ceremony enacted in the market-place.\r\n    Frederic was exalted upon a high platform ascended by a flight\r\n    of steps. Charles, clad in complete steel but bareheaded and\r\n    unattended, rode slowly around the platform three times, \"which\r\n    they say was the custom in such solemnities of investiture,\" adds\r\n    an eyewitness,[10] as though he considered the ceremony somewhat\r\n    archaic. Then the candidate dismounted, received the mantle of the\r\n    empire from an attendant, and slowly ascended the steps to the\r\n    emperor's feet, while a new escutcheon, displaying the insignia of\r\n    the freshly acquired fiefs, quartered on the Burgundian arms, was\r\n    carried before him. Kneeling at the emperor's feet, the duke laid\r\n    two fingers on his sword hilt and repeated the oath of fealty and\r\n    service in low but distinct tones. Other rites followed, and then\r\n    Charles was proclaimed Duke of Guelders.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MAXIMILIAN OF AUSTRIA, MEDAL]\r\n\r\n    Thus one object of the conference was attained, and all the\r\n    world thought it was only a question of time when the greater\r\n    investiture would be celebrated. Charles's star was in the\r\n    ascendant. There seemed no limit to the power he had acquired\r\n    over his suzerain, who apparently graciously nodded assent to his\r\n    requests, while the duke, too, withdrawing from his alliance with\r\n    the King of Hungary, appeared very conciliatory in all doubtful\r\n    issues. At the same time, his confidence in Frederic was by no\r\n    means perfect.\r\n\r\n    \"The emperor is acting with perfect imperial authority and thinks\r\n    that no one has a right to dispute it, nevertheless the duke\r\n    yearns for the sanction of the electors and is set upon obtaining\r\n    it.\"[11] The tone taken by Charles was that of humble ignorance.\r\n    \"Little instructed as I am in imperial German law, I am anxious to\r\n    have your opinion on the legal ability of the emperor to erect a\r\n    kingdom.\" On November 8th, in the evening, the electors present in\r\n    Trèves declared that they were not exactly sure about the imperial\r\n    authority, but they were sure that it was not their duty to\r\n    discuss the legal attributes of imperial puissance.\r\n\r\n    Under these circumstances what remained to hinder the attainment\r\n    of Charles's desire? The emperor consented, and the only people\r\n    who could have stayed his consent expressly stated that his was\r\n    the final word, not theirs. It was easy for onlookers to conclude\r\n    not only that the coronation was certain but that it was done.\r\n\r\n    \"Know that our lord the emperor has made the Duke of Burgundy a\r\n    king of the lands hereafter mentioned and has assured the royal\r\n    title to him and his heirs, male and female; all the territories\r\n    that he holds from the empire together with Guelderland lately\r\n    conquered, and the land of Lorraine, lately lapsed to the empire\r\n    in fief, besides the duchy of Burgundy that formerly was held from\r\n    the crown of France; also the bishoprics of Liege, Utrecht, Dolen,\r\n    and others belonging to the empire, besides a few seigniories,\r\n    also imperial fiefs. All this, royalty and principalities, he\r\n    receives from a Roman emperor.\"\r\n\r\nSo wrote Albert of Brandenburg on November 13th, trusting to the\r\nword of an envoy who had left matters in so advanced a state when he\r\ndeparted from Trèves that he felt safe in concluding that achievement\r\nhad been reached.[12]\r\n\r\nVarious letters from the citizens of Berne, too, were filled with\r\nrumours from Trèves. Most extraordinary is one of November 29th,\r\nintended to go the rounds of the Swiss confederacy, containing _exact\r\ndetails of the coronation of Charles as it had taken place five days\r\npreviously_. The boundaries of the new kingdom were specified.[13]\r\nVenice, in hot haste to please the monarch, had instantly shown\r\nexceptional honour to the Burgundian resident. How exact it all\r\nsounded! Yet there was no truth in it.\r\n\r\nThe vacillating emperor was affected by the attitude of his suite, and\r\nby their varying representations. There is no actual proof of French\r\ninterference, but French agents had been seen in the city, and might\r\nhave had private audiences with the emperor. Gradually, relations\r\nchanged between Charles and Frederic. There was a cloud, not\r\ndissipated by a three days' fête given by the duke (November\r\n19th-22d), evidently in farewell. Was Charles too exigeant with his\r\ndemands, too chary of his daughter? Probably.\r\n\r\nOn November 23d, instead of a definitive treaty a simple convention\r\nwas signed, postponing the coronation until February. Emperor and\r\nregal candidate were to meet again at Besançon, Cologne, or Basel. In\r\nthe interval, Charles was to come to a satisfactory understanding with\r\nthe electors and obtain their official endorsement for the imperial\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\nNovember 25th was appointed, _not_ for the regal investiture, but for\r\nFrederic's departure. On the evening of the 24th, he gave audience to\r\nhis councillors and princes. The electors present were urged by the\r\nBurgundians to give their own conditional approval at least, and to\r\nconsent to a reduction of the military obligations to be incurred\r\nby Charles. It was a crisis, however, where nobody wished to pledge\r\nanything definitely. There was an evident disposition to await some\r\nfurther issue before final action.\r\n\r\nThe leave-taking between the bargain makers was expected to be as\r\npompous as had been the entry into Trèves. It was far into the night\r\nof November 24th when the audience broke up. Little rest was there for\r\nthe imperial suite, for when the tardy November sun arose above the\r\neastern horizon, its rays met Frederic sailing down the Moselle. Not\r\nonly had no imperial adieux been uttered, but no imperial debts had\r\nbeen settled. This was the news that was awaiting Charles when he\r\nawoke. Baffled he was, but not in his hope of being a king that day.\r\nNo, only in his expectation of a stately pageant.[14] In all haste he\r\nsent Peter von Hagenbach to ride more swiftly along the bank than the\r\nboat could sail, so as to overtake the traveller and urge him to wait\r\nfor a few more words on divers topics. In one account it is reported\r\nthat Frederic, though annoyed at the interruption, still assented to\r\nHagenbach's request. No sooner was the latter away, however, than he\r\nchanged his mind and continued his course.\r\n\r\nRumour was busy, in regard to this strange exit of the emperor from\r\nthe scene. The general belief among contemporaries was that it was on\r\nthe eve of the intended coronation that Frederic turned his back on\r\nthe scene. Take first the words of Thomas Basin, whose statement that\r\nhe was in the very midst of the events can hardly be doubted:[15]\r\n\r\n    \"But alas how easily and instantly human desires change, and how\r\n    fragile are the alliances and friendships of men, especially of\r\n    princes, which are not joined and confirmed by the glue of Christ\r\n    ... as the sacred Psalm sings, 'Put not your trust in princes\r\n    nor in the sons of men in whom there is no safety.' Suddenly,\r\n    forsooth, when they were thought to be harmonious in charity,\r\n    benevolence, and friendship, when they offered each other such\r\n    splendid entertainment, when they feasted together in regal luxury\r\n    in all unity and friendship, when all things, as has been said,\r\n    needed for the magnificence of such a great honour were made\r\n    ready and prepared, so that on the third day should occur the\r\n    celebration of that regal dignity _[fastigii],_ and the\r\n    _[provectio]_ promotion of a new king and the erection of a new\r\n    kingdom or the restoration and renovation of an ancient one,\r\n    now obsolete from antiquity, were expected by all with great\r\n    attention;--something occurred. I do not know what; hesitation or\r\n    suspicion, fancied or justified, unexpectedly affected the emperor\r\n    ... and embarking on his ship in the very early morning he sailed\r\n    down the river Moselle to the Rhine. And thus was frustrated the\r\n    hope of the duke and of all the Burgundians who believed that\r\n    he was to be elevated to a king. In a moment this hope was\r\n    extinguished like a candle.\r\n\r\n    \"We were present there in the city of Trèves, attached to the\r\n    suite of neither prince, not serving or pretending to serve either\r\n    of them. But we ascertained nothing either then or later, although\r\n    we made many inquiries, about the cause of this sudden departure\r\n    and we are still ignorant of the truth. When the day broke after\r\n    the emperor's departure, and the duke was informed of the fact, he\r\n    was also assured that the vessel in which the emperor sailed was\r\n    opposite the monastery of St. Mary Blessed to the Martyrs. So he\r\n    sent messengers hastily to beg the emperor to stay for a very\r\n    brief interview with the duke, assuring him that the very least\r\n    delay possible should occur if he did the favour. But no attention\r\n    was paid to the signals from the shore and the course was\r\n    continued.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop wrote these words some time after the event. There are\r\nother accounts preserved, actual letters written within a few days or\r\nweeks of November 25th, wherein is evinced similar ignorance of what\r\nhad actually passed. The following gives several suggestions of\r\ndifficulties not mentioned elsewhere. A certain Balthasar Cesner,\r\nsecretary, writes to Master Johannes Gelthauss and others in\r\nFrankfort, from Cologne, on December 6th.[16] He was attached to\r\nthe imperial service, and possibly was one of the few attendants on\r\nFrederic in the hasty journey from Trèves. After touching on Cologne\r\naffairs he proceeds:\r\n\r\n    \"I must inform your excellencies how the Duke of Burgundy came\r\n    with all pomp for his coronation as king of the kingdom of\r\n    Burgundy and Friesland with twenty-six standards besides a\r\n    magnificent sceptre and crown. He also wished to take his duchy\r\n    and territories in Savoy[17] and Guelders and others in fief from\r\n    him [the emperor] and not from the empire.[18] This and other\r\n    extraordinary demands his imperial grace did not wish to grant,\r\n    and on that account he has broken off the interview and gone away.\r\n    Everything was prepared for the coronation, the chair for the\r\n    taking.[19] It is said that he is to be crowned in Aix. It may be\r\n    hoped not [_non speratur_]. You can understand me as well as your\r\n    faithful servant.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Master Hans I hope that you will not laugh at me. I can\r\n    please my gracious lord and be worthy of praise if you will only\r\n    trust me.\r\n\r\n    \"Despatched from Cologne on St. Nicholas Day itself.\r\n\r\n    \"To the Jurisconsult Master Johannes Gelthauss, Distinguished\r\n    advocate, master, preceptor of the city of Frankfort.\"\r\n\r\nThe two kingdoms are also mentioned by Snoy:\r\n\r\n    \"Two realms, namely Burgundy and Frisia; in the second, Holland,\r\n    Zealand, Guelders, Brabant, Limburg, Namur, Hainaut, and the\r\n    dioceses of Liege, Cambray, and Utrecht; in the first, Burgundy,\r\n    Luxemburg, Artois, Flanders, and three bishoprics.\"\r\n\r\nThe chronicler adds that this plan was discussed in secret\r\nconference.[20]\r\n\r\nAgain the rumour that the final straw that broke the emperor's\r\nresolution was the duke's desire to take Savoy and Guelders from\r\nhis hand alone, is suggestive. On the duke's part, this wish might\r\nindicate an attempt to separate a portion of territory from the empire\r\nin a way to deceive his contemporaries into thinking that his kingdom\r\nwas an imperial fief, while, in reality, it was an independent realm,\r\nas he or his successors could declare at a convenient moment. But this\r\nseems at variance with his attested desire for electoral support.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious tangle and never fully unravelled. Yet, considering\r\nthe emperor's personal characteristics, his last action does not\r\nseem inexplicable. As his visitor showed the intensity of his will,\r\nFrederic became restive. Phlegmatic, obstinate, yet conscious of his\r\nown weakness, personal conflicts with a nature equally obstinate and\r\nmuch more vigorous were exceedingly unpleasant. The collision made him\r\nwrithe uneasily and prefer to slip out of his embarrassment as quietly\r\nas he could.\r\n\r\nThe proposed leave-taking was to be very magnificent, and the\r\nmagnificence again was significant of Burgundian wealth. Whether the\r\nduke would surely keep his pledge of sharing that wealth with the\r\narchduke if the emperor went so far that he could not draw back, was a\r\nconsideration that undoubtedly may have affected Frederic. Had Mary of\r\nBurgundy accompanied her father, had the wedding of the daughter and\r\ninvestiture of the new king been planned for the same day, had the\r\npromises been exchanged simultaneously, the leave-taking might have\r\npassed, indeed, as a third ceremonial in all stateliness.\r\n\r\nIf Frederic doubted the surety of his bargain, it is not surprising.\r\nIt was notorious how the duke had played fast and loose with his\r\ndaughter's hand, withdrawing it from the grasp of a suitor as the\r\ngreater advantages of another alliance were presented to him, or as\r\nthe mere disadvantage of any marriage at all became unpleasantly near.\r\nVigorous man of forty that he was, Charles had no personal desire to\r\nsee a son-in-law, _in propria persona_, waiting for his shoes--a fact\r\nperfectly patent to the emperor, as it was to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe task of making the imperial adieux was entrusted to the imperial\r\nchamberlain, Ulrich von Montfort, who duly presented his master's\r\nformal excuses to the duke, on the morning of November 25th.\r\n\"Important and urgent affairs had necessitated his presence elsewhere.\r\nThe arrangement discussed between them was not broken but simply\r\npostponed until a more convenient occasion rendered its execution\r\npossible,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe Strasburg chronicles report that Charles was in a towering rage on\r\nreceiving this communication. He clinched his fists, ground his teeth,\r\nand kicked the furniture about the room in which he had locked himself\r\nup.[21] But by the time these words were penned, these authors\r\nwere better informed than Charles about the ultimate result of the\r\nemperor's intentions. The duke may have been angry, but he certainly\r\ncontrolled himself sufficiently to give several audiences in the\r\ncourse of the day--to envoys from Lorraine among others--and was ready\r\nto take his own departure by evening, not doubting that the crown and\r\nsceptre, carefully packed with the mountain of his valuable treasure,\r\nwould assuredly fulfil their destiny in the near future. Trèves was\r\nleft to its pristine repose, and Charles was the last man to realise\r\nthat in its silence were entombed for ever his chances of wearing the\r\nprematurely prepared insignia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This comment of the Strasburg chronicler, Trausch, is\r\nquoted by De Bussière in his _Histoire de la Ligue contre Charles le\r\nTéméraire_, p. 64.

The summer of 1473 had been marked by unprecedented heat and\r\na prolonged drouth.[1] Forest fires raged unchecked on account of the\r\ndearth of water and, for the same reason, the mills stood still.\r\nThe grape crops, indeed, were prodigious, but the vintage was not\r\nprofitable because the wine had a tendency to sour. Gentle rains\r\nin September prepared the ground for an untimely fertility. Trees\r\nblossomed and, though some fruits withered prematurely, cherries\r\nactually ripened. Thus the Rhinelands presented a pleasant appearance\r\nas Charles rode to Lorraine.\r\n\r\nHis first pause was at Thionville in Luxemburg, where he stayed about\r\na fortnight and received ambassadors from Hungary, Poland, Venice,\r\nEngland, Denmark, Brittany, Ferrara, the Palatinate, and Cologne.[2]\r\nThe result of his conference with the last named was a declaration\r\non the duke's part which seriously affected his later career. The\r\ncondition of Cologne must be touched on as an essential part of this\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nThe late Duke of Burgundy had attempted to pursue a line of policy in\r\nregard to the ecclesiastical elections in the diocese of Cologne that\r\nhad succeeded in Liege and in Utrecht. In 1463, he had tried to force\r\nthe chapter to elect his candidate. They had refused to follow\r\nhis leading, but their own choice, Robert, brother of the\r\nelector-palatine, did not prove a congenial chief, and the new prelate\r\nturned to Philip for aid when he found his chapter disposed to\r\nrestrict both his revenues and his temporal authority. Later, in 1467,\r\nas the audacity of his opponents increased, the archbishop appealed to\r\nhis brother, the elector, and to Charles of Burgundy. The latter\r\nwas busy in France, but he wrote a sententious letter to Cologne,\r\nexhorting both chapter and city to be obedient to their chosen\r\nspiritual and lay lord. This intervention was resented. The breach\r\nwidened between Robert and his people, culminating in actual\r\nhostilities. The chapter took possession of the town of Neuss,\r\naccepted Hermann of Hesse as their protector, and sent an embassy to\r\nRome to state their grievances. The elector aided his brother and the\r\nbelligerent parties grew in strength.\r\n\r\nThe city of Cologne wavered for a space, undecided which cause to\r\nespouse, and finally chose the chapter's side, signing a five years'\r\nalliance with that body, which had officially renounced allegiance to\r\nRobert, pending the judgment of pope and emperor on the dissension.\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when Charles entered into possession of\r\nGuelders and manifested a disposition to interest himself in Cologne.\r\nHe informed the chapter that he was greatly displeased with their\r\ncontumely. To Cologne he said, \"Be neutral,\" but the burghers showed\r\nso little inclination to heed his neighbourly advice that he tried\r\nharsher measures and permitted Cologne merchants to be molested in his\r\ndomains.\r\n\r\nIn 1473, all hostilities were suspended in the hopes of imperial\r\nintervention.[3] While Charles was still in Guelders, Robert paid\r\nhim a visit, held long conferences with him, and probably received\r\npromises of future aid, for he had an air of arrogance when he\r\nreturned from the interview. During the sojourn of duke and emperor at\r\nTrèves, a papal legate, the Bishop of Fossombrone, arrived from Rome\r\nwith plenary powers to settle Cologne affairs, and his measures were\r\nendorsed by Charles in a letter from Trèves.\r\n\r\nFor a time Frederic III. seemed inclined to refrain from interference,\r\nthen something influenced him in another direction. When he arrived\r\nat Cologne in November, he received a warm welcome and costly gifts,\r\nwhich he repaid by conferring a mass of privileges on his \"good\r\ncity,\"--cheap and easy benefits,--but he did not prove an efficient\r\narbitrator, simply postponing any decision from day to day, though he\r\nwas begged to settle all difficulties before Charles should attempt to\r\nrelieve him of the trouble.\r\n\r\nTrue, Charles was detained elsewhere. But he no longer felt the need\r\nof conciliating the emperor, and at Thionville, on December 11, 1473,\r\nhe issued a manifesto declaring that his friend Robert was entirely in\r\nthe right, his opponents in the wrong.[4] As these latter defied papal\r\nlegate and arbitrator duly authorised to settle the points of dispute,\r\nhe, Charles of Burgundy, would constitute himself defender of the\r\ninsulted archbishop. At the same time, he despatched Ètienne de Lavin\r\nto check the encroachments of the insolent rebels. The declaration\r\nemboldened Robert to defy the emperor's summons to meet him and the\r\npapal legate. They both declared that they would take measures to\r\nbring him to obedience, but Frederic did not wish to tarry longer at\r\nCologne. In January he took his departure, having directed Hermann of\r\nHesse to protect that see against all aggression.\r\n\r\nApparently, at that time, in spite of the manifesto, there was no\r\nformal treaty between Charles and Robert, but there are two drafts for\r\nsuch a treaty in existence,[5] wherein the former pledged himself to\r\nforce chapter, nobles, and city to submission, in consideration of the\r\nsum of 200,000 florins, while the archbishop gave permission to his\r\nally to garrison all strongholds, including Cologne. Pending his\r\nautumn sojourn in the upper Rhinelands, Charles had, therefore, plans\r\nregarding Cologne definitely in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lorraine_\r\n\r\nThis duchy was even more interesting to Charles than Cologne, and\r\nthere were many matters in its regard which demanded his urgent\r\nattention in 1473. It, too, was a pleasant territory, and conveniently\r\nadjacent to Burgundian lands. A natural means of annexation had been\r\nconsidered by Charles in the proposed marriage between Nicholas, Duke\r\nof Lorraine, and Mary of Burgundy. When that project was abandoned to\r\nsuit Charles's pleasure, he retained the friendship of his rejected\r\nson-in-law until the latter's death in the spring of 1473. So\r\nunexpected was this event, that there was the usual suspicion of\r\npoisoning, and this crime, too, was charged to the account of Louis\r\nXI., apparently without foundation. Certainly that monarch reaped\r\nno immediate advantage from the death, for the family to whom the\r\nsuccession passed was more friendly to Burgundy than to France.\r\n\r\nThe heir to the childless Nicholas was his aunt Yolande of Anjou,\r\ndaughter of old King René of Anjou, sister to the unfortunate\r\nMargaret, late Queen of England, and widow of the Duke of Vaudemont.\r\nThe council of Lorraine lost no time in acknowledging Yolande as their\r\nduchess. She hastened to Nancy, the capital, with her son René, aged\r\ntwenty-two, where they were received hospitably, and then Yolande\r\nformally abdicated in favour of the young man, who was duly accepted\r\nas Duke of Lorraine.\r\n\r\nNow there was a large party of Burgundian sympathisers in Nancy, and\r\nit was probably owing to their pressure that very strong links were at\r\nonce forged between Charles and the new sovereign of the duchy. The\r\napprehension lest the former should protect the land as he had the\r\nheritage of his namesake, little Charles of Guelders, was expressed by\r\nthe timorous, but their counsels were overweighted, and, on October\r\n15th, René accepted a treaty whose terms were very favourable to\r\nBurgundy. In exchange for being \"protector,\"--an office that the\r\nemperor had already been asked to change into suzerainty,--René\r\ncemented an alliance, offensive and defensive, with Charles, giving\r\nthe latter full permission to march his forces across Lorraine.\r\nFurther, he pledged himself to appoint as officials in all important\r\nplaces on the route \"men bound by oath to the Duke of Burgundy.\" Yes,\r\nmore, these were discharged from fidelity to Renè in case he abandoned\r\nBurgundian interests.\r\n\r\nYolande of Vaudemont endorsed these articles by adding her signature\r\nto that of her son. Charles feared, however, that the provisions\r\nmight not be adhered to by the Lorrainers--so humiliating were the\r\nterms--and exacted in addition the signatures of the chief nobles. On\r\nNovember 18th, seventy-four of these gentlemen attested their\r\napproval of an act that practically delivered their land to a\r\nstranger,--evidence that they doubted the ability of their hereditary\r\nchief, and preferred Burgundy to France.\r\n\r\nThere is a story that Charles tried other methods than diplomacy,\r\nbefore he got the better of the young duke in this bargain, that he\r\nactually had him stolen away from the castle of Joinville where he was\r\nstaying with his mother.[6] Louis promptly came forward and arrested a\r\nnephew of the emperor, a student in the University of Paris, and kept\r\nhim as a hostage until the release of René. Rumour, too, asserts that\r\nthere was a treaty of Joinville, wherein René asserted his friendship\r\nwith Louis, which was intermitted by his relations with Charles, to be\r\nresumed later. That also seems to be improbable. The formal alliance\r\nwith Louis did not come then, though the king took immediate care\r\nto build up a party in his behalf in Lorraine, and to keep himself\r\ninformed of the progress of the new regime.\r\n\r\nFrom Thionville, Charles journeyed on to Nancy, where he was welcomed\r\nby his protégé, outside the city walls, and the two rode in together\r\nas the duke and the emperor had entered Trèves. Charles had been so\r\nlong keeping up a show of obsequiousness which he did not feel that,\r\nundoubtedly, he enjoyed again being the first personage.[7] He\r\nrefused, however, to accept the young man's hospitality, and spent the\r\ntwo days of his sojourn in the house of a certain Malhortie, where\r\nhe felt more at ease in his conferences with Lorrainers willing to\r\nproceed further to the disadvantage of their new sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe ally certainly became more exigeant. In various towns on the\r\nMoselle, Épinal, Charmes, Dompaire, etc., the Lorraine soldiers were\r\nreplaced by Burgundians. This immediate and arrogant use of the rights\r\nhe had wrested from the Duke of Lorraine alienated many who had been\r\nwarm for Burgundy. René himself admired Charles as Maximilian had\r\ndone. The strong man exercised a fascination over both youths, but\r\nthe duke did not turn this admiration into real friendship,\r\nunderestimating the character of his protégé. His measures, too, were\r\ntaken without the slightest consideration for local feeling. Garrison\r\nafter garrison was installed and commanded to obey his officers alone,\r\nwhile the soldiers were allowed to levy their own rations, equivalent\r\nto raids on a friendly country. As always, the agglomeration of\r\nmercenary companies was difficult to control. The duke did not succeed\r\nin having those remote from his jurisdiction kept in due restraint.\r\nComplaints began to pour into his headquarters. Public sentiment\r\nshifted day by day. The Burgundian became the personification of a\r\npublic foe. Before Charles proceeded on his way to Alsace, René had\r\nbegun to lose his admiration and it was not long before he impatiently\r\nawaited an opportunity to break with his too doughty protector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alsace_\r\n\r\nDuring the four years that Charles had delayed in coming to look at\r\nthe result of the bargain of 1469 in the Rhine valley, his lieutenant,\r\nPeter von Hagenbach, had given the inhabitants reason to regret\r\nthe easy-going absentee Austrian seigneurs. Much had been done,\r\nundoubtedly, in restraining the lawlessness of the robber barons. The\r\nroads were well policed, and safety was assured to travellers. \"I\r\nspy,\" was the motto blazoned on the livery of the forces led by\r\nHagenbach up and down the land, until he had unearthed lurking\r\nvagabonds. It was acknowledged that gold and silver could be carried\r\nopenly from place to place, and that night journeys were as safe as\r\nday. Still, this advantageous change had not won popularity for the\r\nman who wrought it. Perhaps the people thought it less burdensome to\r\nmake their own little bargains with highwaymen or petty nobles,[8] a\r\nlaw unto themselves, than to meet the rigorous requisitions of the\r\nBurgundian tax collector.\r\n\r\nIt was the country that had profited most by the new administration.\r\nThe small towns had long enjoyed great independence, and had shown\r\nability in managing their own affairs. They wanted no interference.\r\nNot liked by those whom he had really protected, Hagenbach was\r\nabsolutely hated by the burghers who felt his iron hand, without\r\nacknowledging that its pressure had more good than evil in it.\r\n\r\nThen there were the neighbours to be considered. The Swiss had hated\r\nSigismund and all Austrians, and had been prepared to prefer Burgundy\r\nas a power in the Rhinelands. But Hagenbach took no pains to win their\r\nfriendship. His insolent fashion of referring to them as \"fellows\" or\r\n\"rascals,\" added to acts of aggression, unchecked if not condoned by\r\nhim, aroused bitter dislike to him in the confederated cantons,[9] and\r\nin their allies, Berne, Mulhouse, etc. By 1473, there was a growing\r\nsentiment in Helvetia that they would be happier if Austria had her\r\nown again, while the uneasiness in the cities that stood alone had\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\nWithin Hagenbach's immediate jurisdiction, the opposition to his\r\nmeasures took a definite form long before the duke's arrival there.\r\nThe various commissioners sent by Charles to inspect the quality of\r\nhis bargain had all agreed in an urgent recommendation to the duke to\r\nredeem, at the earliest possible moment, all the troublesome mortgages\r\nhoneycombing his authority. Hagenbach, too, was fully convinced of the\r\nnecessity for this measure, but he was not provided with sufficient\r\nmoney to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1473, therefore, he resolved to lay a new tax on\r\nwine. This impost, called the \"Bad Penny,\" was bitterly resented for\r\ntwo reasons. The burden was oppressive to the vintners and it was an\r\nillegal measure, as no sanction had been given by the local estates.\r\nThree towns, Thann, Ensisheim, and Brisac, declared that they were\r\ndetermined to refuse payment.\r\n\r\nHagenbach marched a force into the Engelburg, a stronghold dominating\r\nThann, bombarded the town, and took it easily. Thirty citizens were\r\ncondemned to death as leaders in an iniquitous rebellion against the\r\njust orders of their lawful governor. Some of these, indeed, were\r\npardoned, though their estates were confiscated, but five or six\r\nwere publicly executed, and their bodies hung exposed to view on the\r\nmarket-place, as a hideous object-lesson of the cost of resisting\r\nBurgundian orders.\r\n\r\nOne execution sufficed to render Ensisheim submissive, but Brisac\r\nproved more obstinate. The magistrates there did not resort to force.\r\nThey declared there was no need, for they were fully protected by the\r\narticle in the treaty of St. Omer, which forbade arbitrary imposition\r\nof any tax on the part of the suzerain. Their determined refusal made\r\nthe lieutenant consent to refer the question to the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nand messengers were despatched to Trèves to represent the respective\r\ngrievances of governor and governed. The collection of the tax was\r\npostponed until Charles could examine the situation.\r\n\r\nA determined effort to bring the independent town of Mulhouse under\r\nBurgundian sway was another act of 1473, fanning opposition to a white\r\nheat that forged organised resistance to any extension of Burgundian\r\nauthority. For three years, Hagenbach had endeavoured to convince the\r\nburghers of that imperial city that they would be wise to accept the\r\nduke's protection and have their debts paid. The latter were, indeed,\r\noppressive, but there was fear lest \"protection\" might be more so, and\r\nconference after conference failed to produce the acquiescence desired\r\nby Hagenbach.\r\n\r\nIn 1473, that zealous servant of Burgundy declared that if the\r\nburghers persisted in their refusal he would resort to force. Their\r\nreply was that Mulhouse could not take such an important step without\r\nconsulting her friends, the Swiss. \"Are the cantons going to help you\r\npay your debts?\" was the sneering comment of Hagenbach. \"Mulhouse is\r\na bad weed in a rose garden, a plant that must be extirpated. Its\r\nsubmission would make a charming pleasure ground out of the Sundgau,\r\nAlsace, and Breisgau. The duke knew no city which he would prefer to\r\nMulhouse for a sojourn,\" were his further statements.[10]\r\n\r\nTwo days were given to the town council for an answer. Hagenbach\r\nremarked that it was useless to think that time could be gained until\r\nthe mortgaged territories should return to Austria. \"Far from planning\r\nredemption, Duke Sigismund is now preparing to cede to _Charles le\r\ntéméraire_ as much again of his domain and vassals.\" Still Mulhouse\r\nwas not convinced that the only course open to her was to let Charles\r\npay her debts and receive her homage. No answer was forthcoming in the\r\ntwo days, but ready scribes had prepared many copies of Hagenbach's\r\nletter, which were sent to all who might be interested in checking\r\nthese proposals of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nOn February 24, 1473, a Swiss diet met at Lausanne and there the\r\nmatter was weighed. Hagenbach's letter was shown to those who had\r\nnot seen it, and methods of rescuing Mulhouse from her dilemma were\r\ncarefully considered. Years ago a union had existed between the forest\r\ncantons and the Alsatian cities. There were propositions to renew\r\nthis alliance so as to present a strong front to their Burgundian\r\nneighbour. The cantons had enough to do with their own affairs, but\r\nthe result of the discussion was that, on March 14th, a ten-year\r\nAlsatian confederation was formed in imitation of the Swiss.\r\n\r\nThe chief members were Basel, Colmar, Mulhouse, Schlestadt, and two\r\ndioceses, and it is referred to as the _Basse-Union_ or the Lower\r\nUnion, the purposes being to guarantee mutually the rights of the\r\ncontracting parties, to meet for discussion on various questions, and,\r\nspecifically, to help Mulhouse pay her debts. A few days later, March\r\n19th, there was a fresh proposition to make an alliance between\r\nthis _Basse-Union_ and the Swiss confederation. This required a\r\n_referendum_. Each Swiss delegate received a copy of the articles to\r\ntake back to his constituents for their consideration. No bond between\r\nthe confederation and the union was, however, in existence at the time\r\nwhen Charles was approaching Alsace. Various conciliatory measures\r\non his part had somewhat lessened immediate opposition to him, but,\r\nnevertheless, there were frequent conferences about affairs. Diets\r\nwere almost continuous and there were strenuous efforts to raise money\r\nto free Mulhouse from her hampering financial embarrassments.\r\n\r\nHagenbach had not followed up his threats of immediate war measures,\r\nbut it was known that he had obtained imperial authorisation to\r\nassume the jurisdiction of Mulhouse, a step which her allies hoped to\r\nforestall by settling her debts. Strasburg offered to contribute six\r\nhundred florins, Berne and Soleure seven hundred, Basel four hundred,\r\nwhile Colmar, Schlestadt, Obernai, and Kaisersberg together hoped to\r\nraise another four hundred. A diet was called at Basel for December\r\n11th, and Zürich and Lucerne were expected to enter into the union.\r\nThe tidings of the duke's approach were undoubtedly a stimulus to\r\nthese renewed efforts to make the league strong enough to withstand\r\nhim. The sentiment expressed by the pious Knebel, \"May God protect us\r\nfrom his mighty hand,\" voiced probably a wide-spread dread.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles entered Alsace, his escort was large enough to\r\ninspire fear, but there was no opposition to his advance, though\r\nconsultations, now at one city, now at another, were frequent. The\r\nduke paid little heed to their deliberations, under-estimating their\r\nimportance, while he was gracious to any words of welcome offered to\r\nhim. Strasburg sent him greetings while he rested at Châtenois, and so\r\ndid Colmar. The latter town expressed her willingness to receive him\r\nand an escort of one or two hundred, but was firm in her refusal to\r\nadmit a larger force within her walls. By this precaution, Charles was\r\nbaffled in his plot to gain possession of the town, and so passed on\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas eve, the traveller made a formal entry into Brisac, where\r\na temporary court was established, and where audience was given to\r\nvarious embassies with the customary Burgundian pomp. Meanwhile the\r\ntroops, forced to camp without the walls, were a burden to the land,\r\nand seem to have been more odious than usual to their unwilling hosts.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Brisac offered homage on their knees and had their\r\nhopes raised high by their suzerain's pleasant greeting, but they\r\nfailed to obtain the hoped for assurance that the treaty of St. Omer\r\nshould be observed in all respects. Among the envoys were many who\r\nundertook to remonstrate in a friendly fashion about the imposition\r\nof the \"Bad Penny\" tax on the Alsatians, and the over-severity of\r\nHagenbach's administration. The cause of Mulhouse, too, was urged,\r\nnotably by Berne. The representations of these last envoys were\r\nreceived most courteously. The duke rather thought that the city could\r\nbe detached from the league, and therefore gave himself some trouble\r\nto establish friendly relations.\r\n\r\nTo Mulhouse, too, his tone was conciliatory. He wrote a pleasant\r\nletter to the town and despatched a councillor thither, who would, he\r\nassured them, arrange matters to their satisfaction. But an abortive\r\n_coup d'état_ on the part of the Burgundians, which would have given\r\nthem possession of Basel, destroyed the effect of these reassuring\r\nphrases. The burghers were warned in time, looked to their defences,\r\nand banished from their midst every individual suspected of Burgundian\r\nsympathies. Every newcomer was carefully scrutinised before he was\r\nadmitted within the walls, and the Rhine was guarded most rigidly. The\r\npropriety of these precautions was soon proven.\r\n\r\nCharles ordered a review at Ensisheim, the official capital of the\r\nlandgraviate. Thither marched his troops from every quarter. Those\r\nfrom Säckingen, Lauffen, and Waldshut found their shortest route over\r\nthe bridge at Basel, and there they appeared and begged to be allowed\r\nto cross. Their sincerity was doubted, and the least foothold on the\r\ncity's territory was sternly refused then and a week later, when the\r\nrequest was renewed. The method of introducing friendly troops into a\r\ntown and then seizing it by a sudden _coup de main_ was what Charles\r\nhad been suspected of plotting for Metz, and later for Colmar, and\r\nthere seems to be no doubt that a third essay of this rather stupid\r\nstratagem was planned, only to fail again, and this time to be\r\npeculiarly disastrous in its reflex action.\r\n\r\nThe review took place and the strength of the Burgundian mercenaries\r\nwas duly displayed to the Alsatians, but no satisfactory assurances\r\nwere given to Brisac and the other towns that their suzerain\r\nwould restrict his measures of taxation and administration to the\r\nstipulations of the contract of St. Omer. On the contrary, when\r\nCharles passed on to Burgundy it was plain to all that he had _not_\r\nrestricted the powers of his lieutenant in any respect, but rather had\r\nendorsed his general method of procedure.\r\n\r\nOne night was spent at Thann[11] and then the duke took his leave of\r\nthe annexed region whose people had hoped so much from his visit to\r\nthem. In mid-January he arrived at Besançon, his winter journeying\r\nbeing wonderfully easy in the unprecedentedly mild weather.\r\n\r\nHagenbach lost no time in proceeding to the levying of the impost now\r\napproved by the duke, who had at the same time expressly ordered that\r\nthe people were to be treated mildly, and that summary punishment\r\nwas to check all excesses on the part of the eight hundred Picards\r\nemployed by Hagenbach to aid the tax collector. The governor, however,\r\nsaw no further need for gentle treatment or for respect to privileges.\r\nIn Brisac, municipal elections were arbitrarily set aside, and\r\nofficers appointed by the governor. The corporation was curtailed\r\nof power, and the burghers were forced to prepare to march against\r\nMulhouse.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished his duty to his own satisfaction, Hagenbach\r\nproceeded to give himself some relaxation. His own marriage took place\r\non January 24th, and he celebrated the occasion with great fêtes. It\r\nis of this period in Hagenbach's life that the stories of gross excess\r\nare told.[12] It seems as though, having once abandoned restraint\r\ntowards the city, his personal passions, too, were permitted to run\r\nriot, and he spared no wife nor maid to whom he took a fancy.\r\n\r\nAs he had succeeded in impressing the \"Bad Penny\" on the little\r\nindependent landowners, he tried to extend it to the territory of the\r\nBishop of Basel. Vehement was the opposition which was reported to the\r\nduke, who promptly ordered his lieutenant to restore the prisoners he\r\nhad taken and to cease his aggressions. Charles was not ready to\r\nmeet the Swiss, and was willing to defer an issue, but he was wholly\r\nignorant of the real strength of the confederation. Hagenbach then\r\nproceeded to make a stronghold of Brisac and waited for further\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: De Roye, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: He also issued administrative orders. It was at this time\r\nthat he instituted a high court of justice and a chamber of accounts\r\nat Mechlin, both designed to serve for all the Netherland provinces.\r\nThis measure was bitterly resented by the local authorities.\r\n(Fredericq. _Le rôle politique et social des ducs de Bourgogne_, p.\r\n183.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Letters are preserved in the Cologne archives.

And the\r\nconfident duke had no wish to disclaim the subtle flattery of the\r\nimplied comparison between him and the subject of the words of the\r\nprophet.[1]\r\n\r\nThe traveller had slept at Périgny, about a league from the capital\r\nof Burgundy, so as to make the last stage of his journey thither in\r\nleisurely state. Unpropitious weather on Saturday, January 22d, the\r\nappointed day, made postponement of the ducal parade necessary, out\r\nof consideration for the precious hangings and costly ecclesiastical\r\nrobes that were to grace the ceremonies of reception and investiture.\r\nFortunately, Sunday, January 23d, dawned fair, and heralds rode\r\nthrough the city streets at an early hour, proclaiming the duke's\r\ngracious intention to make his entry on that day. Immediately,\r\ntapestries were spread and every one was alert with the last\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FORTIFIED CHURCH IN BURGUNDY - XVth Century]\r\n\r\nLavish was the display of biblical phrases, like that cited, which\r\nwere planted along the ducal way and on a succession of stagings\r\nerected for various exhibits. On the great city square, the platform\r\nwas capacious and many actors played out divers roles. Here stood the\r\nscroll-bearing angels on either side of a living representation of\r\nChrist. In the background clustered three separate groups of people\r\nrepresenting, respectively, the three Estates. Above their heads more\r\ninscriptions were to be read.[2] \"All the nations desire to see the\r\nface of Solomon,\" \"Behold him desired by all races,\" \"Master, look on\r\nus, thy people,\" were among the legends.\r\n\r\nThe stately pageant, in which dignitaries, lay and ecclesiastical,\r\nfrom other parts of the duke's domains participated, proceeded past\r\nall these soothing insinuations that Charles of Burgundy resembled\r\nSolomon in more ways than one, to the church of St. Benigne. Here\r\npledges of mutual fidelity were exchanged between the Burgundians and\r\ntheir ruler. The Abbé of Citeaux placed the ducal ring solemnly\r\nupon Charles's finger as a symbol, and he was invested with all the\r\nprerogatives of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nFrom the church, the train wound its way to the Ste. Chapelle, past\r\nmore stages decorated with more flowers of scriptural phrase such as\r\n\"A lion which is strongest among beasts and turneth not away for any,\"\r\n\"The lion hath roared, who will not fear?\" \"The righteous are as bold\r\nas a lion,\" etc.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the concluding ceremonies of investiture were\r\nperformed, and followed by a banquet. Charles was arrayed in royal\r\nrobes, and his hat was in truth a crown, gorgeous with gold, pearls,\r\nand precious stones. After a repast, prelates, nobles, and civic\r\ndeputies were convened in a room adjoining the dining-hall, where\r\nfirst they listened to a speech from the chancellor. When he had\r\nfinished, the duke himself delivered an harangue wherein he expatiated\r\non the splendours of the ancient kingdom of Burgundy. Wrongfully\r\nusurped by the French kings, it had been belittled into a duchy, a\r\nmeasure much to be regretted by the Burgundians. Then the speaker\r\nbroke off abruptly with an ambiguous intimation \"that he had in\r\nreserve certain things that none might know but himself.\"[3]\r\n\r\nWhat was the significance of these veiled allusions? It could not have\r\nbeen the simple scheme to erect a kingdom, because that was certainly\r\nknown to many. Charles had, doubtless, an ostrich-like quality of\r\nmind which made him oblivious to the world's vision but even he could\r\nhardly have ignored the prevalence of the rumours regarding the\r\ninterview of Trèves, rumours flying north, east, south, and west.\r\nMight not this suggestion of secrets yet untold have had reference to\r\nthe ripening intentions of Edward IV. and himself to divide France\r\nbetween them?\r\n\r\nWhen his own induction into his heritage was accomplished, Charles was\r\nready to pay the last earthly tribute to his parents. A cortège had\r\nbeen coming slowly from Bruges bearing the bodies of Philip and\r\nIsabella to their final resting-place in the tomb at Dijon, to which\r\nthey were at last consigned.[4]\r\n\r\nA few weeks more Charles tarried in the city of his birth, and then\r\nwent to Dôle where he was invested with the sovereignty of the\r\nFranche-Comté and confirmed the privileges. Thus after seven years of\r\npossession _de facto_, he first actually completed the formalities\r\nneedful for the legal acquisition of his paternal heritage. The\r\nexpansion of that heritage had been steady for over half a century.\r\nEvery inch of territory that had come under the shadow of the family's\r\nadministration had remained there, quickly losing its ephemeral\r\ncharacter, so that temporary holdings were regarded in the same light\r\nas the estates actually inherited. At least, Charles, sovereign duke,\r\ncount, overlord, mortgagee, made no distinction in the natures of his\r\ntenures. But just as the last link was legally riveted in his own\r\nchain of lands, he was to learn that there were other points of view.\r\n\r\nThe statement is made and repeated, that the report of the duke's\r\nafter-dinner speech at Dijon was a fresh factor in alarming the people\r\nin Alsace and Switzerland about his intentions, and making them hasten\r\nto shake off every tie that connected them with Charles and his\r\nambitious projects of territorial expansion.[5] As a matter of fact,\r\nthere had been for months constant agitation in the councils of the\r\nSwiss Confederation and the Lower Union as to the next action.\r\n\r\nOpposition to Sigismund had been long existent, antipathy to Austria\r\nwas so deeply rooted that the idea of restoring that suzerainty in the\r\nRhine valley was slow to gain adherents. Probably the arguments that\r\ncame from France were what carried conviction. It was a time when\r\nLouis spared no expense to attain the end he desired, while he posed\r\nas a benevolent neutral.[6] His servants worked underground. Their\r\nopen work was very cautious. It was French envoys, however, who\r\nannounced to the Swiss Diet, convened at Lucerne, that Sigismund was\r\nquite ready to come to an understanding in regard to an alliance and\r\nthe redemption of his mortgaged lands.\r\n\r\nThat was on January 21, 1474, the very day when the mortgagee was\r\npreparing to ride into Dijon and read the agreeable assurances of his\r\nwisdom, strength, and puissance. Yet a month and Sigismund's envoys\r\nwere seated on the official benches at the Basel diet, ranking with\r\nthe delegates from the cantons and the emissaries from France. On\r\nMarch 27th, the diet met at Constance, and for three days a debate\r\nwent on which resulted in the drafting of the _Ewige Richtung_,\r\nthe _Réglement définitif_, a document which contained a definite\r\nresolution that the mortgaged lands were to be completely withdrawn\r\nfrom Burgundy, and all financial claims settled. This resolution was\r\nsubscribed to by Sigismund and the Swiss cantons. Further, it was\r\ndecided to ignore one or two of the stipulations made at St. Omer and\r\nto offer payment to Charles at Basel instead of Besançon.\r\n\r\nMeantime that creditor, perfectly convinced in his own mind that\r\nthe legends of his birthplace were correct in their rating of his\r\ncharacter and his qualities, again crossed Lorraine and entered\r\nLuxemburg, where he celebrated Easter. It was shortly after that\r\nfestival, on April 17th, that a letter from Sigismund was delivered to\r\nhim announcing in rather casual and off-hand terms that he was now in\r\na position to repay the loan of 1469, made on the security of those\r\nRhinelands. Therefore the Austrian would hand over at Basel 80,000\r\nflorins, 40,000 the sum received by him, 10,000 paid in his behalf to\r\nthe Swiss, and 30,000 which he understood that Charles had expended\r\nduring his temporary incumbency,[7] and he, Sigismund, would resume\r\nthe sovereignty in Alsace.\r\n\r\nIt was all very simple, at least Sigismund's wish was. The expressions\r\nemployed in the paper were, however, so ambiguous, the language so\r\ninvolved, that Charles expended severe criticism on his cousin's style\r\nbefore he proceeded to answer his subject-matter. To that he replied\r\nthat the bargain between him and Sigismund was none of his seeking.\r\nThe latter had implored his protection from the Swiss, had begged\r\nrelief in his financial straits. Touched by his petitions, Charles\r\nhad acceded to his prayers and the lands had enjoyed security under\r\nBurgundian protection as they never had under Austrian. Charles had\r\nduly acquitted himself of his obligations, he had done nothing to\r\nforfeit his title. The conditions of redemption offered by Sigismund\r\nwere not those expressly stipulated. If a commission were sent to\r\nBesançon, the duke would see to it that the merits of the case were\r\nproperly examined.\r\n\r\n\"If, on the contrary, you shall adhere to the purpose you have\r\ndeclared, in violation of the terms of the contract and of your\r\nprincely word, we shall make resistance, trusting with God's help that\r\nour ability in defence shall not prove inferior to what we have used\r\nto repulse the attacks of the Swiss--those attacks from which you\r\nsought and received our protection.\"\r\n\r\nBefore this letter reached its destination, the duke's deputy in the\r\nmortgaged lands had already found his resources wholly inadequate to\r\nmaintain his master's authority. After Charles departed from Alsace,\r\nHagenbach's increased insolence and abandonment of all the restraint\r\nthat he had shown while awaiting the duke's visit soon became\r\nunbearable. The deliberations in Switzerland concerning their return\r\nto Austrian domination also naturally affected the Alsatians and made\r\nthem bolder in resenting Hagenbach's aggressions.\r\n\r\nThann and Ensisheim were both firm in refusing admission to his\r\ngarrisons. Brisac was in his hands already, and her fortifications\r\nheld by mercenaries, but an order to the citizens to work, one and\r\nall, upon the defences, produced a sudden disturbance with very\r\nserious results. It was at Eastertide, and the command to desecrate a\r\nhallowed festival, one especially cherished in the Rhinelands, proved\r\nthe final provocation to rebellion.\r\n\r\nThere is a black story in the Strasburg chronicle, moreover, that this\r\nmisuse of Easter Day was not Hagenbach's real crime. He simply\r\nwished to get all combatants out of the city before butchering the\r\ninhabitants and his purpose was discovered in time. That charge does\r\nnot, however, seem substantiated by other evidence. But there is no\r\ndoubt that the citizens lashed themselves into a state of fury, fell\r\nupon the mercenaries, and killed many of them in spite of their own\r\nunarmed condition. Hagenbach, driven back into his lodgings, appeared\r\nat the window and offered various concessions, being actually humbled\r\nand intimidated by the unexpected turning of the submissive folk\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nBut the revolutionary spirit raged beyond the reach of conciliatory\r\nwords. Some of the more intelligent burghers endeavoured to give a\r\nshow of propriety to events, by promptly re-establishing their own\r\nancient council, arbitrarily abolished by Hagenbach, while taking a\r\nnew oath to the Duke of Burgundy, according to the formula of 1469.\r\nThey also despatched envoys to the duke with explanations of their\r\nproceedings, stating further that it was Hagenbach's misrule alone to\r\nwhich protest was made; that they were not in revolt against Charles.\r\nThe latter answered, \"Send Hagenbach to me,\" but the provisional\r\ngovernment, by the time they received this order, felt strong enough\r\nto disregard it and to continue to act on their own initiative.\r\n\r\nHagenbach was cast not only into prison but into irons. All fear of\r\nand respect for his authority was thrown to the winds, his offer of\r\nfourteen thousand florins as ransom being sternly refused.\r\n\r\nDeputations came from the confederation to congratulate the officials\r\n_de facto_ and to promise aid. The next step gave the lie direct to\r\nthe message sent to Charles upholding his authority while protesting\r\nagainst his lieutenant. Sigismund was urged to return to his own\r\nwithout further delay for legal formalities with his creditor. He\r\nassented. On April 30th, accordingly, the Austrian duke arrived in\r\nBrisac and picked up the reins of authority which he had joyfully\r\ndropped four years previously.\r\n\r\nThe rabble welcomed his coming with effusion, singing a ready parody\r\nof an Easter hymn:[8]\r\n\r\n  \"Christ is arisen, the _landvogt_ is in prison,\r\n  Let us all rejoice, Sigismund is our choice.\r\n  Kyrie Eleison!\r\n  Had he not been snared, evil had it fared,\r\n  But now that he is ta'en, his craft is all in vain.\r\n  Kyrie Eleison!\"\r\n\r\nThus it was under Sigismund's auspices that the late governor was\r\nbrought to trial. Instruments of torture sent from Basel were employed\r\nto make Hagenbach confess his crimes. But there was nothing to\r\nconfess. As a matter of fact the charges against him were for\r\nwell-known deeds the character of which depended on the point of view.\r\nWhat the Alsatians declared were infringements of their rights, the\r\nduke's deputy stoutly asserted were acts justified by the terms of the\r\ntreaty. In regard to his private career the prisoner persisted in\r\nhis statement that he was no worse than other men and that all his\r\nso-called victims had been willing and well rewarded for their\r\nsubmission to him.\r\n\r\nOn May 9th, the preliminaries were declared over and the trial began\r\nbefore a tribunal whose composition is not perfectly well known,\r\nbut which certainly included delegates from the chief cities of the\r\nlandgraviate, and from Strasburg, Basel, and Berne.[9]\r\n\r\nThe trial was practically lynch law in spite of the cloak of legality\r\nthrown over it. Charles alone was Hagenbach's principal and he alone\r\nwas responsible for his lieutenant's acts. The intrinsic incompetence\r\nof the court was hotly urged by Jean Irma of Basel, Hagenbach's\r\nself-appointed advocate, but his defence was rejected. Public opinion\r\ninsisted upon extreme measures, and the sentence of capital punishment\r\nwas promptly followed by execution.\r\n\r\nPetitions from the prisoner that he might die by the sword and be\r\npermitted to bequeath a portion of his property to the church of\r\nSt. Étienne at Brisac were granted. The remainder of his wealth was\r\nconfiscated by Sigismund, who had withdrawn to Fribourg during the\r\nprogress of the trial. Even Hagenbach's bitterest foes acknowledged\r\nthat the late governor made a dignified and Christian exit from the\r\nlife he had not graced.\r\n\r\nCharles is said to have beaten well the messenger who brought him the\r\nnews of this trial and execution, in the very presence of Sigismund\r\nwho had not yet bought back his rights in the landgraviate, where he\r\nhad appointed Oswald von Thierstein as governor, and where he was thus\r\npresuming to use sovereign power. This was not sufficient, however,\r\nto make the duke change his own plans. Stephen von Hagenbach was\r\nentrusted with the commission of punishing the Alsatians for his\r\nbrother's ignominious deposition, and he did his task grimly.\r\nAccording to the Strasburg chronicler, this Hagenbach, at the north,\r\nand his colleague, the Count of Blamont, at the south, did not have\r\nmore than six or eight thousand men apiece, but they left Hun-like\r\nreputations behind them. Devastation, slaughter, pillage in houses and\r\nchurches, all in the name of the duke, contributed to the zeal with\r\nwhich the Austrian's return was ratified by popular acclamation, and\r\nwith which the contingents sent to Alsace by the confederates were\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nSigismund's letter to Charles is casual in tone and obscure in\r\nphraseology. A statement presented somewhat later to the emperor by\r\nthe _Basse Union_ is more precise in the justification offered for the\r\nevents and in the grievances rehearsed.[10] That is, Sigismund treats\r\nthe transaction as a purely financial one, naturally completed between\r\nhim and his creditor by the offer to liquidate his debt. The plea made\r\nby the Alsatians and their friends is, that Charles had failed to keep\r\nhis solemn engagements and that his appointed lieutenant had been\r\npeculiarly odious and had broken the laws of God and man, and that the\r\nmercenaries employed by him, the Burgundians, Lombardians, and their\r\nfellows, had pitilessly ravaged the county of Ferrette, the Sundgau,\r\nand the diocese of Basel. The charges are itemised.[11]\r\n\r\n    \"All this, well-known to the Duke of Burgundy, has neither been\r\n    checked nor punished by him. In consequence, our gracious Seigneur\r\n    of Austria has been obliged to restore the land and people to his\r\n    sovereignty and that of the House of Austria, which he has done\r\n    with God's aid to prevent the complete annihilation and total\r\n    destruction of land and people.\"\r\n\r\nCharles did not hasten to Alsace to settle matters in person, but\r\npursued his intention of reducing Cologne to the archbishop's control,\r\nundoubtedly thinking that the base which would then be open to the\r\narchbishop's protector on the lower Rhine would facilitate his\r\noperations in the upper valleys. Meanwhile the Emperor Frederic had\r\nemphatically declared that he alone was the Defender of the Diocese,\r\nand that the unholy alliance between Robert and Charles was a menace\r\nto the empire. His letters to Charles exhorted him to abandon the\r\nenterprise and to accept mediation; those to the electors, princes,\r\nand cities of the empire urged them to defend Cologne against Burgundy\r\nuntil he himself arrived on the scene. There was a hot correspondence\r\nbetween all parties concerned, from which nothing resulted. Charles\r\nhad various reasons for delay. There was trouble in other quarters of\r\nhis domain. Flanders was in a state of ferment at his requisitions\r\nfor money, and the Franche-Comté was on the point of making active\r\nresistance to the imposition of the _gabelle_.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these complications, Charles decided to prolong his\r\ntruce with Louis XI., to May 1, 1475. That monarch was well pleased\r\nto continue to pursue his own plans under cover of neutrality. The\r\ndetermination of the anti-Burgundian coalition in Germany to keep\r\nCharles within the limits of his own estates was a pleasant sight to\r\nthe French king, and he felt that he could afford to wait.\r\n\r\nIn June an edict was sent forth from Luxemburg, forbidding all owing\r\nallegiance to the Duke of Burgundy to have any commercial relations\r\nwith the rebels of Cologne, or of Alsace, or with the cities of the\r\n_Basse Union_, and declaring the duke's intention to take the field\r\nat once, to reinstate the archbishop in his rightful see. This was a\r\ndeclaration of war and was speedily followed by the duke's advance\r\nto Maestricht, where he spent a few days in July, collecting a force\r\nwhich finally amounted to about twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th he sat down before Neuss, which had again emphatically\r\nrefused entry to him and his troops. Three days the duke gave himself\r\nfor the reduction of the town, but there he remained encamped for\r\nnearly a whole year! Neuss was resolved to resist to the last\r\nextremity, while Bonn, Andernach, and Cologne contributed their\r\nassistance by worrying and harassing the besiegers to the best of\r\ntheir ability. It was a period when Charles seemed to have only one\r\nsure ally, and that was Edward of England, whose own plans were\r\nforming for a mighty enterprise--no less than a new invasion of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nOn July 25th, the very day that Charles was on his march up to Neuss,\r\nhis envoys signed at London a treaty wherein the duke promised Edward\r\nsix thousand men to aid him to \"reconquer his realm of France.\"\r\nNothing loth to dispose of his future chickens, Edward, in his turn,\r\npledged himself to cede to Charles and his heirs, without any lien\r\nof vassalage, the duchy of Bar, the countships of Champagne, Nevers,\r\nRethel, Eu, and Guise, all the towns on the Somme, and all the estates\r\nof the Count of St. Pol. Other territories of Charles were to be\r\nexempt from homage. Yes, and by June 1, 1475, Edward would land in\r\nFrance and set about his conquests. Nor were commercial interests\r\nforgotten; \"to the duchess his sister (to the Flemings) is accorded\r\npermission, to take from England wool, woollen goods, brass, lead, and\r\nto carry thither foreign merchandise.\"\r\n\r\nThe year when Charles was waiting before the gates of Neuss was full\r\nof many abortive diplomatic efforts on the part of both the duke and\r\nLouis XI, and it was the latter who managed to save something even\r\nfrom broken bargains. The Swiss not only counted on his friendship,\r\nbut were constantly encouraged by his money, which emboldened them to\r\nsend a letter of open defiance to Charles: \"We declare to your most\r\nserene highness and to all of your people, in behalf of ourselves\r\nand our friends, an honourable and an open war.\" To the herald who\r\ndelivered this document Charles answered: \"O Berne, Berne!\"[12] He\r\nfelt that he had been betrayed.\r\n\r\nThis was on October 26th. The defiance was followed by a descent of\r\nthe mountaineers upon Alsace, which Charles had not yet released\r\nfrom his grasp. Stephen von Hagenbach prepared to defend Burgundian\r\ninterests at Héricourt, a good strategic position on the tiny Luzine.\r\nHere, the Swiss were about to besiege him, when the Count of Blamont\r\narrived with two bodies of Italian mercenaries, aggregating more than\r\ntwelve thousand men, and attempted to draw off the besieging force.\r\nHis plan failed--the tables were turned. It was the Burgundians who\r\nwere fiercely attacked and who lost the day. Hagenbach was forced to\r\nsurrender, obtaining honourable terms, however, and Sigismund put a\r\ngarrison into Héricourt on November 16th.\r\n\r\nThis was a tremendous surprise to Charles. That cowherds could repulse\r\nhis well-trained troops was a thought as bitter as it was unexpected.\r\nBut he put aside all idea of punishing them for the moment, and\r\ncontinued to \"reduce Neuss to the obedience of the good archbishop,\"\r\nand Hermann of Hesse continued to aid the town in its determined\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nThe opprobrious names applied to the would-be and baffled conqueror at\r\nthis time are curiously similar to the epithets hurled at Napoleon\r\na few centuries later. He was compared to Anti-Christ himself, with\r\ndemoniac attributes added, when Alexander was felt to be too mild a\r\ncomparison. There was still a terrible fear of the duke's ambition,\r\neven though, in the face of all Europe, the Swiss had repulsed his\r\nmen, and Neuss obstinately refused to open her gates, while the world\r\nwondered at the duke's obstinacy displayed in the wrong place. The\r\nbelief expressed several times by Commines that God troubled Charles's\r\nunderstanding out of very pity for France, was a current rumour.\r\n\r\nAt the end of April an English embassy arrived at the camp, which was\r\nkept in a marvellous state of luxury, even though disease was not\r\nsuccessfully curbed in the ranks. The urgent entreaty of the embassy\r\nwas that Charles should raise this useless siege, fruitless as it\r\npromised to be, owing to the difficulty of cutting off the town's\r\nsupplies. Edward IV was almost ready to despatch his invading army.\r\nHe implored his dear brother to send him transports and to prepare to\r\nreceive him when he landed. A letter from John Paston gives a glimpse\r\ninto the situation[13]:\r\n\r\n    \"For ffor tydyngs here ther be but ffewe saffe that the assege\r\n    lastyth stylle by the Duke off Burgoyn affoor Nuse, and the\r\n    Emperor hath besyged also not fferr from there a castill and\r\n    another town in lykewyse wherin the Duke's men ben. And also, the\r\n    Frenshe Kynge, men seye, is comen right to the water off Somme\r\n    with 4000 spers; and sum men have that he woll, at the daye off\r\n    brekyng off trewse, or else beffoor, sette uppon the Duks contreys\r\n    heer. When I heer moor, I shall sende yowe moor tydyngs.\r\n\r\n    \"The Kyngs imbassators, Sir Thomas Mongomere and the Master off\r\n    the Rolls be comyng homwards ffrom Nuse; and as ffor me, I thynke\r\n    I sholde be sek but iff I see it....\r\n\r\n    \"For it is so that to morrow I purpose to ryde in to Flaundyrs\r\n    to purveye me off horse and herneys and percase I shall see the\r\n    essege at Nwse er I come ageyn.\"\r\n\r\nThere was more reason for Charles to be heartsick at the sight than\r\nfor John Paston, and he did grow weary of the further waiting and\r\nanxious, for his truce with Louis was drawing to a close. On May 22d,\r\nthere was a skirmish between his troops and the imperial forces,\r\nwherein Charles claimed the victory. In reality, there was none on\r\neither side, but the semblance was sufficient to soothe his _amour\r\npropre_, and to convince him that an accommodation with Frederic would\r\nnot detract from his dignity.\r\n\r\nA large fleet of Dutch flatboats had been despatched to help convey\r\nthe English army, thirsting for conquest, across the sea. Six thousand\r\nmen in the duke's pay, too, were to be ready to meet Edward IV., and\r\nswell his escort as he marched to Rheims for his coronation. Other\r\nmatters also demanded Charles's personal attention. Months had elapsed\r\nand Héricourt was unpunished--Berne had not been reproved.\r\n\r\nRené of Lorraine was formally admitted to the League of Constance on\r\nApril 18, 1475, and was now ready openly to abjure the \"protection\" he\r\nhad once accepted from Burgundy. There was a touch of old King René's\r\ntheatrical taste in his grandson's method of despatching the herald\r\nwho rode up to the duke's gorgeous tent of red velvet on May 10th. The\r\nman was, however, so overcome at the first view of _le Téméraire_ that\r\nhe hastily delivered up his letter, and threw down the blood-stained\r\ngauntlet, which he carried as a gage of war, without uttering a word.\r\nThen he fell on his knees, imploring the duke's pardon.[14] Charles\r\nwas so little displeased at the signs of the impression his presence\r\nmade that, instead of being angry with the man, he gave him twelve\r\nflorins for his good news. The terms of the declaration of war carried\r\nby the herald were as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"To thee, Charles of Burgundy, in behalf of the very high, etc.,\r\n    Duke of Lorraine, my seigneur, I announce defiance with fire and\r\n    blood against thee, thy countries, thy subjects, thy allies, and\r\n    other charge further have I not.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe reply was straightforward:\r\n\r\n    \"Herald, I have heard the exposition of thy charge, whereby thou\r\n    hast given me subject for joy, and, to show you how matters are,\r\n    thou shalt wear my robe with this gift, and shalt tell thy master\r\n    that I will find myself briefly in his land, and my greatest fear\r\n    is that I may not find him. In order that thou mayst not be afraid\r\n    to return, I desire my marshal and the king-at-arms of the Toison\r\n    d'Or to convoy thee in perfect safety, for I should be sorry if\r\n    thou didst not make thy report to thy master as befits a good and\r\n    loyal officer.\"\r\n\r\nThus was Charles pressed from the south and lured to the north.\r\nExcellent reason for obeying the order of the pope's legate that duke\r\nand emperor must lay down arms under pain of excommunication did\r\neither belligerent refuse! The armistice accepted on May 28th was\r\nfollowed by a nine months' truce signed on June 12th. It was a truce\r\nstrictly to the advantage of Frederic and Charles. The Rhine cities,\r\nLouis XI., René of Lorraine, were alike ignored and disappointed in\r\nthe expectations they had based on Frederic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Plancher, _Histoire générale et particulière de\r\nBourgogne, avec des notes et des preuves justificatives_, iv.,\r\ncccxxviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Preparations for the duke's visit to Dijon had been set\r\non foot almost immediately after Philip's death in 1467. One Frère\r\nGilles had devoted many hours to searching the Scriptures for\r\nappropriate texts to figure in the reception. Every phrase indicating\r\nleonine strength was noted down.

Two days later and he has heard of the\r\ntruce. He seizes the occasion to express to the Privy Council of Berne\r\nhis real opinion of the emperor: \"So Frederic has deserted us all!\"[2]\r\nWell, it was not the first time! Thirty years previous, when Louis was\r\ndauphin, the emperor had tried to turn the Swiss against him. Had not\r\nGod, knowing the hearts of men, inspired the brave mountaineers, Louis\r\nwould have been a victim of execrable treachery. The outcome had been\r\nwonderful, for an eternal friendship had sprung up between him and the\r\nSwiss which must be preserved.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Charles has made his own definite plan of the campaign which\r\nwas to introduce Edward into Rheims for the coronation. The following\r\nletter from him to Edward IV. bears no date, but it was evidently\r\nwritten at about the time of the truce[3]:\r\n\r\n    \"Honoured seigneur and brother, I recommend myself to you. I have\r\n    listened carefully to your declaration through the pronotary, and\r\n    understand that you do not wish to land without my advice, for\r\n    which I thank you. I understand that some of your counsellors\r\n    think you had better land in Guienne, others in Normandy, others\r\n    again at Calais. If you choose Guienne you will be far from my\r\n    assistance but my brother of Brittany could help you. Still it\r\n    would be a long time before we could meet before Paris. As to\r\n    Calais, you could not get enough provisions for your people nor I\r\n    for mine. Nor could the two forces make juncture without attack,\r\n    and my brother of Brittany would be very far from both. To my\r\n    mind, your best landing is Normandy, either at the mouth of the\r\n    Seine or at La Hogue. I do not doubt that you will soon gain\r\n    possession of cities and places, and you will be at the right hand\r\n    of my brother of Brittany and of me. Tell me how many ships you\r\n    want and where you wish me to send them and I will do it.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing further rumours of the actual arrival of the English, Louis\r\nhastened to Normandy to inspect the situation for himself. There he\r\nlearned that his own naval forces stationed in the Channel to ward off\r\nthe invaders had landed on the very day before his arrival, abandoning\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\n    \"When I heard that we took no action, I decided that my best plan\r\n    would be to turn my people loose in Picardy and let them lay\r\n    waste the country whence they [the English] expected to get their\r\n    supplies.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the rumour that was permitted to be current in\r\nFrance was, that Charles of Burgundy had been utterly defeated at\r\nNeuss, and that there was nothing whatsoever to apprehend from him.\r\nHe, meanwhile, was continuing his own preparations by strenuous\r\nendeavours to levy more troops and to obtain fresh supplies. After\r\nthe signing of the convention with the emperor, the duke proceeded to\r\nBruges to meet the Estates of Flanders. The answer to his demand for\r\nsubsidies was a respectful refusal to furnish funds, on the plea that\r\nhis expansion policy was ruining his lands. Counter reproaches burst\r\nfrom Charles. He accused the deputies of leaving him in the lurch and\r\nthus causing his failure at Neuss. Neither money, nor provisions, nor\r\nsoldiers had they sent him as loyal subjects should.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING RUHMREICH AND HIS DAUGHTER EHRENREICH\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS REPRESENTING CHARLES AND MARY OF BURGUNDY IN WOODCUT IN\r\nEARLY EDITION OF TEMDANK. POEM BY MAXIMILIAN I.]\r\n\r\n    \"For whom does your prince labour? Is it for himself or for you,\r\n    for your defence? You slumber, he watches. You nestle in warmth,\r\n    he is cold. You are snug in your houses while he is beaten by the\r\n    wind and rain. He fasts, you gorge at your ease.... Henceforth you\r\n    shall be nothing more than subjects under a sovereign. I am and I\r\n    will be master, bearding those who oppose me.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThen turning to the prelates he continued: \"Do you obey diligently and\r\nwithout poor excuses or your temporal goods shall be confiscated.\"\r\nTo the nobles: \"Obey or you shall lose your heads and your fiefs.\"\r\nFinally, he addressed the deputies of the third estate in a tone full\r\nof bitterness: \"And you, you eaters of good cities, if you do not obey\r\nmy orders literally as my chancellor will explain them to you, you\r\nshall forfeit privileges, property, and life.\"\r\n\r\nAll the fervency of this adjuration failed to convince the deputies of\r\ntheir duty, as conceived by the orator. They declared that they had\r\nlevied troops and would levy more, for defence, but that the four\r\nmembers of Flanders were agreed that they would contribute nothing to\r\noffensive measures. Charles must accept their decision as his sainted\r\nfather had done. The details of all the aid they had given him, 2500\r\nmen for Neuss and many other contributions, were recapitulated.\r\nFlanders had been generous indeed. The concluding phrases of their\r\nanswer were as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"As to your last letters, requiring that within fifteen days every\r\n    man capable of bearing arms report at Ath, these were orders\r\n    impossible of execution, and unprofitable for you yourself. Your\r\n    subjects are merchants, artisans, labourers, unfitted for arms.\r\n    Strangers would quit the land. Commerce, in which your noble\r\n    ancestors have for four hundred years maintained the land,\r\n    commerce, most redoubtable seigneur, is irreconcilable with war.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer gave the true key to the situation. The Estates of\r\nFlanders were determined to be bled no further for schemes in which\r\nthey did not sympathise. When this memorial was presented to Charles\r\nhe broke out into fresh invective about the base ingratitude of the\r\nFlemish: \"Take back your paper,\" were his last words. \"Make your own\r\nanswer. _Talk_ as you wish, but _do_ your duty.\" This was on July\r\n12th. Charles had no further time to waste in argument. He was still\r\nconvinced that the burghers would, in the end, yield to his demands.\r\n\r\nWith a small escort Charles left Bruges, and reached Calais on July\r\n14th, where he had been preceded by the duchess, eager to greet her\r\nbrother, who had actually landed on July 4th, with the best equipped\r\narmy--about twenty-four thousand men--that had ever left the shores of\r\nEngland, and the latest inventions in besieging engines.\r\n\r\nThe expedition proved a wretched failure--a miserable disappointment\r\nto the English at home, who had been lavish in their contributions.\r\nCharles seems to have been put out by the place of landing. His own\r\nplan is clear from the letter quoted. He wished the two armies of\r\nEdward and himself to sweep a large stretch of territory as they\r\nmarched toward each other. The one thing that he objected to was a\r\nconsolidation of the two forces. Incapacity to turn an unexpected or\r\nan unwelcome situation to account was one of the duke's most\r\ndeeply ingrained characteristics. He showed no inventiveness or\r\nresourcefulness. He held his own army at a distance from the English,\r\nmuch to the invader's chagrin, who was forced to march unaided over\r\nregions rendered inhospitable by Louis's stern orders, and outside\r\nof cities ready to hold him at bay. \"If you do not put yourself in a\r\nstate of security, it will be necessary to destroy the city, to our\r\nregret,\" was the king's message to Rheims, and the most skilful of\r\nFrench engineers was fully prepared to make good the words.\r\n\r\nOpen hostilities were avoided. Edward camped on the field of\r\nAgincourt, where perhaps he dreamed of his ancestor's success, but\r\nno fresh blaze of old English glory illumined his path. He did not\r\nproceed to Paris, there was no coronation at Rheims, no comfortable\r\nreception within any gates at all, for Charles was as chary as Louis\r\nhimself of giving the English a foothold, though he advised Edward to\r\naccept an invitation from St. Pol to visit St. Quentin. This, however,\r\nproved another disappointment. Just as Edward was ready to enter,\r\nthe gates opened to let out a troop which effectually repulsed the\r\nadvancing foreigners. The Count of St. Pol had changed his mind.\r\n\r\n\"It is a miserable existence this of ours when we take toil and\r\ntrouble enough to shorten our life, writing and saying things exactly\r\nopposite to our thoughts,\" writes the keenest observer of this\r\nelaborate network of pompous falsehoods[6] wherein every action was\r\nentangled. Louis XI trusted no one but himself, while he played\r\nwith the trust of all, and his game was the safest. His fear of the\r\ninvaders was soon allayed. \"These English are of different metal from\r\nthose whom you used to know. They keep close, they attempt nothing,\"\r\nhe wrote to the veteran Dammartin.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a patent fact that Edward was not a foe to be feared.\r\nBaffled and discouraged, he readily opened his ears to his French\r\nbrother, and Louis heaped grateful recognition on every Englishman who\r\nhelped incline his sovereign to peaceful negotiations. Velvet and\r\ncoin did their work. Edward was easily led into the path of least\r\nresistance, and an interview between the rival kings was appointed\r\nfor August 29th. Great preparations were made for their meeting on a\r\nbridge at Picquigny, across which a grating was erected. Like Pyramus\r\nand Thisbe, the two princes kissed each other through the barriers,\r\nand exchanged assurances of friendship. Edward was, indeed, so easy to\r\nconvince that Louis was in absolute terror lest his English brother\r\nwould accept his invitation to show him Paris before his return. No\r\nwonder Edward was deceived, for Louis was definite in his hospitable\r\noffers, suggesting that he would provide a confessor willing to give\r\nabsolution for pleasant sins.\r\n\r\nThe duke was duly forewarned of this colloquy. On August 18th, he was\r\nstaying at Peronne, whence he paid a visit to the English camp. It was\r\nended without any intimation of Edward's change of heart towards the\r\nFrench king whom he had come to depose, though his plan was then ripe.\r\nOn the 20th, Charles received a written communication with the news\r\nwhich Edward had disliked broaching orally, and was officially\r\ninformed that the king had yielded to the wishes of his army, and was\r\nconsidering a treaty with Louis XI., wherein Edward's dear brother of\r\nBurgundy should receive honourable mention did he desire it.\r\n\r\nOn hearing these most unwelcome tidings, Charles set off for the\r\nEnglish camp in hot haste, attended by a small escort, and nursing\r\nhis wrath as he rode.[7] King Edward was rather alarmed at the duke's\r\naspect when the latter appeared, and asked whether he would not like a\r\nprivate interview. Charles disregarded his question. \"Is it true? Have\r\nyou made peace?\" he demanded. Edward's attempt at smooth explanations\r\nwas blocked by a flood of invectives poured out by Charles, who\r\nremembered himself sufficiently to speak in English so that the\r\nbystanders might have the full benefit of his passionate reproaches.\r\nHe spared nothing, comparing the lazy, sensual, pleasure-loving\r\nmonarch, whose easeful ways were rapidly increasing his weight of\r\nflesh, with the heroism of other English Edwards with whom he was\r\nproud to claim kin. As to the offers to remember his interests in\r\nthe perfidious peace that perfidious Albion was about to swear\r\nwith equally perfidious France, his rejection was scornful indeed.\r\n\"Negotiate for _me_! Arbitrate for _me_! Is it I who wanted the French\r\ncrown? Leave _me_ to make my own truce. I will wait until you have\r\nbeen three months over sea.\" Among those who witnessed the scene were\r\nseveral Englishmen who sympathised with Charles--if we may believe\r\nCommines. \"The Duke of Burgundy has said the truth,\" declared the Duke\r\nof Gloucester, and many agreed with him.\" Having given vent to his\r\nsentiments, Charles hurried away from his disappointing ally and\r\nreached Namur on the 22d, where he spent the night.\r\n\r\nEdward troubled himself little about his brother-in-law's summary of\r\nhis character. He was tired of camp hardships, and both he and his men\r\nfound it very refreshing to have Amiens open her gates to them at the\r\norder of Louis XI. Food and wine were lavished upon all alike. It\r\nwas a delightful experience for the English soldiers to see tables\r\ngroaning with good things spread in the very streets, and to be bidden\r\nto order what they would at the taverns with no consideration for the\r\nreckoning. They enjoyed good French fare, free of charge, until their\r\nhost intimated to King Edward that his men were very intoxicated and\r\nthat there were limits in all things. But Louis did not spare his\r\nmoney or his pains until he was sure that a bloodless victory had been\r\nwon. He fully realised the importance of extravagant expenditure in\r\norder to reach the goal he had set himself.\r\n\r\n    \"We must have the whole sum at Amiens before Friday evening,\r\n    besides what will be wanted for private gratifications to my Lord\r\n    Howard, and others who have had part in the arrangement.... Do not\r\n    fail in this that there may be no pretext for a rupture of what\r\n    has been already settled.\"\r\n\r\nThough they had now no rood of land, the English returned richer than\r\nthey came, and they eased their _amour propre_ by calling the sums\r\nthat had changed hands, \"tribute money.\"[8]\r\n\r\n    \"Ryght reverend and my most tender and kynd Moodre, I recommende\r\n    me to youw. Pleas it yow to weete that blessyd be God, this vyage\r\n    of the kynges is fynnysshyd for thys tyme and alle the kynges ost\r\n    is comen to Caleys as on Mondaye last past, that is to seye the\r\n    iiij daye of Septembre, and at thys daye many of hys host be\r\n    passyd the see in to Ingland ageyn, and in especiall my Lorde off\r\n    Norfolk, and my bretheryn ....I also mysselyke somewhat the heyr\r\n    heer; for by my trowte I was in goode heele whan I come hyddre and\r\n    all hooll and to my wetyng I hadde never a better stomake in my\r\n    lyffe and now in viij dayes I am crasyd ageyn.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThus wrote one Englishman from Calais and doubtless many others found\r\nthe air more wholesome at home.\r\n\r\nCharles of Burgundy was now ready to consider the affairs of Lorraine.\r\nHe advised René of his intentions, in a manifesto which reached him\r\non September 5th. The preamble contained a long list of the manifold\r\nbenefits conferred upon Lorraine by the House of Burgundy. Then René\r\nwas admonished to observe in every particular the terms of his own\r\ntreaty with Charles, which he, René, had signed voluntarily, or the\r\nformer would \"make him know the difference between his friendship and\r\nhis enmity.\"\r\n\r\nThis menace was ominous to the poor Duke of Lorraine. For on September\r\n13th, his friend Louis XI. had signed a fresh treaty with Charles\r\nof Burgundy at Soleure, and Campobasso was marching mercenaries in\r\nBurgundian pay towards the unfortunate duchy. In other words, the\r\nFrench king abandoned the young protégé whom he had spared no pains\r\nto alienate from Burgundian protection. It was a moment when his one\r\ninterest apparently was to settle accounts with the Count of St.\r\nPol, who had been equally treacherous in his dealings with England,\r\nBurgundy, and France.[10]\r\n\r\nHaving rested during the summer, the Burgundian troops were in fine\r\ntrim when Charles marched to Nancy, taking towns on the way, and sat\r\ndown before the capital in the last week of October. From his camp he\r\nwrote to the Duke of Milan:\r\n\r\n    \"Very dear brother, I recommend myself to you. I have just\r\n    accepted a truce with the king for nine years to come, in the form\r\n    and manner contained at length in the copy of the articles which\r\n    I have given to your ambassador, resident with me . . . . And be\r\n    sure, _fratello mio_, that nothing would have induced me to accept\r\n    the truce, had you not been comprised therein. And, similarly, you\r\n    must be satisfied in all the pacts between the king and myself,\r\n    just as you were comprised in the convention lately made at Neuss.\r\n\r\n    \"For the rest, I have heard from your ambassador about the troops\r\n    that can be furnished me, for which I am well content, praying you\r\n    to continue to serve me in accordance with the promises of your\r\n    ambassador. As to the coming of your brother to me [Sforza, Duc de\r\n    Bari], I should be very glad. He has no reason now for delay as he\r\n    can travel in Lorraine as safely as in Lombardy, as I have said\r\n    to your ambassador. Pray the Lord to give you the desires of your\r\n    heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Written in my camp at Nancy the penultimate day of October, 1475.\r\n\r\n    \"CHARLES.\"[11]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome trifling assistance was offered to René by Strasburg and other\r\nfoes to Burgundy, but it was wholly insufficient to rescue him from\r\nhis difficulties, and he was finally obliged to order the capitulation\r\nof Nancy on November 19th. The magistrates desired to hold out, but\r\nwere forced by the populace to submit, and on November 30, 1475,\r\nCharles of Burgundy marched triumphantly through the gate of Craffe\r\ninto the capital of Lorraine where he was received as the sovereign\r\nduke.[12]\r\n\r\nThis time Charles acted the role of a merciful and diplomatic\r\nconqueror. There was no cruelty permitted, and every evidence of\r\nconciliation was shown. The majority of the Lorrainers accepted the\r\nnew order of things without further protest. At the end of December,\r\nCharles convened the Estates of Lorraine in the ducal palace,\r\naddressed them as his subjects of Burgundy, promised to be a good\r\nprince, demanded their attachment, confided his plans of expansion,\r\nand announced his intention of making Nancy the capital of his states.\r\nAgain the duke's star rose. This acquisition seemed a sign of the\r\nreality of his dreams. Even before the fall of Nancy, his approaching\r\nsuccess bore fruit, inasmuch as the emperor changed the late\r\nconvention into a firmer treaty signed on November 17th. Indeed had\r\nCharles died at that moment, there would have been little doubt that\r\nhis dreamed-of kingdom had been simply prevented by a mere accident.\r\n\r\nThe detailed story of all that had happened in the Swiss Confederation\r\nand the Lower Union, since their formal declaration of war against\r\nCharles, is too complicated to relate. At the begining of 1476, the\r\nsituation was, briefly, that Sigismund held the debated mortgaged\r\nlands, while the Swiss allies, with Berne as the most militant member\r\nof the league, had continued to carry on offensive operations against\r\nthe duke and his allies, notably the Duchess of Savoy. The conquest\r\nof Lorraine caused a panic, especially in the face of the fresh\r\nagreements between the duke and the emperor and the king.\r\n\r\nThere was a short period of hesitation, marked by a truce till January\r\n1, 1476, between Charles and the confederates, a period when the timid\r\namong the allies urged their counsel of reconciliation at all hazards.\r\nCharles, too, seems to have desired an accord rather than hostilities,\r\neven though he still bore the Swiss a bitter grudge for Héricourt. It\r\nwas probably appeals from Yolande of Savoy that decided him to open a\r\ncampaign in midwinter.\r\n\r\n    \"The prince has been so busy for a week past [wrote the Milanese\r\n    ambassador] in the reorganisation of his army according to new\r\n    ordinances, and in the regulation of his receipts and outlays that\r\n    he has scarcely given himself time to eat once in twenty-four\r\n    hours. He is importuned by the Duchess of Savoy and the Count of\r\n    Romont for aid against the Swiss who respect no treaty, and do\r\n    not cease increasing their forces. In consequence, Duke Charles\r\n    intends leaving Nancy in six days to go towards the Jura. He\r\n    expects to take with him 2300 lances and 10,000 ordnance, which,\r\n    joined to the feudal militia of Burgundy and Savoy, will swell his\r\n    army to the number of 25,000 combatants. His operations are so\r\n    planned that he will have more to gain than to lose.\"[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Charles left Nancy on January 11th, he issued one of his\r\ngrandiloquent manifestoes declaring that he was acting in behalf of\r\nall princes and seigneurs who had suffered wrong at the hands of the\r\nSwiss, and that he was ready to punish all who had provoked his just\r\nwrath by ravaging his province of Burgundy. It was rather a curious\r\nact on his part, to let his chief mercenary captain go off to make a\r\npilgrimage just as he was on the eve of a campaign, but so he did,\r\ngranting Campobasso leave of absence to visit the shrine of St. James\r\nat Compostella, a leave possibly utilised by the Italian to further\r\nthe understanding with Louis XI., at which he arrived later.\r\n\r\nOn across the Jura marched the Burgundian army, while the Swiss diet\r\ncame to a slow and confused decision to prepare to meet him. He did\r\nnot take the route generally expected, directly towards Berne, his\r\nchief antagonist, but turned aside and attacked the little fortress of\r\nGranson. The castle was not over strong. Efforts to provision it by\r\nwater failed, and, finally, on February 28th, after a brief siege, the\r\ncaptain of the garrison, Hans Wyler, capitulated to the duke's German\r\nforces, who represented to them that Charles was as generous as he was\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nIf the Milan ambassador can be trusted, the surrender was\r\nunconditional. Charles was soon on the spot. The four hundred and\r\ntwelve soldiers, who had succeeded in holding the Burgundian army at\r\nbay for ten whole days, were made to march past his tent with bowed\r\nheads. Then he ordered one and all to be hanged, reserving two to\r\nhelp in the executions. Four hours were occupied in fulfilling these\r\npitiless orders. Panigarola arrived at the camp on the 29th,--it was\r\nleap year, 1476,--and found this accomplished and saw the bodies\r\nhanging on the trees, but he asserts that no word was broken.[14]\r\nCharles was now absolutely confident of complete success. \"_Bellorum\r\neventus dubii sunt_,\" remarked the prudent Milanese, however, and he\r\nwas proved right.\r\n\r\nWhen the allied forces of the mountaineers finally arrived in the\r\nduke's neighbourhood a hot pitched battle ensued. The Burgundians,\r\nled by the duke in person, were thrown into utter confusion. The\r\nmercenaries, terrified by the uncouth yells and battle-cries of Uri\r\nand Unterwalden, simply lost their heads and did nothing. Charles was\r\npushed on as far as Jougne. It was not only a defeat, but a complete\r\nrout. When the Swiss came in sight of the late garrison hanged to\r\nthe trees, their rage knew no bounds. In their turn they massacred,\r\nhanged, and drowned every one in Burgundian pay whom they could lay\r\nhands upon. The Burgundians saved their lives when they could, but\r\ntheir valuable artillery and their baggage, the mass of riches that\r\nCharles carried with him were ruthlessly sacrificed, and gathered\r\nup contemptuously as booty by the Swiss, who cared little for the\r\ntapestries and jewels though they prized the gold. Such was the battle\r\nof Granson, on the 2nd of March.\r\n\r\nThe fatal mistake committed by Charles was that he despised his enemy\r\nand underestimated his quality as well as his strength. Just before\r\nengaging in battle, the whole Swiss army fell upon their knees in\r\nprayer that the issue might be successful. This action deceived\r\nCharles into thinking that they were cowardly and his opinion was\r\nshared by his men. A contemptuous laugh broke out from the Burgundian\r\nranks.[15]\r\n\r\nOlivier de la Marche ends a meagre account of Granson with the\r\nfollowing rather barren words[16]:\r\n\r\n    \"In short the Duke of Burgundy lost the day and was pushed back as\r\n    far as Jougne, where he stopped, and it is meet that I tell how\r\n    the duke's bodyguard saved themselves ... and reached Salins where\r\n    I saw them arrive for I was not present at the battle on account\r\n    of a malady I suffered. From Jougne the duke went to Noseret, and\r\n    you can understand that he was very sad and melancholy at having\r\n    lost the battle, where his rich baggage was stolen and his army\r\n    shattered.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 1476, Sir John Paston writes to Margaret Paston from\r\nCalais:\r\n\r\n    \"As ffor tydyngs heer we her ffrom alle the worlde. ... Item, the\r\n    Duke of Burgoyne hath conqueryd Lorreyn and Queen Margreet shall\r\n    nott nowe be lykelyhod have it; wherffer the Frenshe kynge\r\n    cheryssheth hyr butt easelye; but afftr thys conquest off Loreyn\r\n    the Duke toke grete corage to goo upon the londe off the Swechys\r\n    [Swiss] to conquer them butt the berded hym att an onsett place\r\n    and hathe dystrussyd hym and hathe slayne the most part of his\r\n    vanwarde and wonne all hys ordynnaunce and artylrye and mor ovyr\r\n    all stuffe thatt he hade in hys ost with hym; exceppte men and\r\n    horse ffledde nott but they roode that nyght xx myle; and so the\r\n    ryche saletts, heulmetts garters, nowchys[17] gelt and all is\r\n    goone with tente pavylons and all and soo men deme hys pryde is\r\n    abatyd. Men tolde hym that they were ffrowarde karlys butte he\r\n    wolde nott beleve it and yitt men seye that he woll to them ageyn.\r\n    Gode spede them bothe.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the rumours that were current represented Charles as\r\ncompletely prostrated by his disaster. This was only half true.\r\nHis efforts to retrieve himself were immediate but, physically, he\r\ncertainly showed the effects of this campaign. He was attacked by a\r\nlow fever, his stomach rejected food, insomnia afflicted his nights,\r\nand dropsical swellings appeared on his legs. This condition was\r\nattributed to his fatigues and exposure in a hard climate, and to his\r\nhabit of drinking warm barley-water in the morning. He was urged to\r\nuse a soft feather-bed instead of his hard couch, while Yolande's own\r\nphysician and one Angelo Catto watched anxiously over him. The latter\r\nclaimed the credit of saving his life. Charles was not, however, fully\r\nrecovered when he resumed his activities and held a review on May 9th.\r\nWith all his efforts exerted in every quarter likely to yield results,\r\nthe whole number of troops was but twenty thousand men. Every onlooker\r\nfelt that the duke was now trying to accomplish something quite beyond\r\nhis resources.\r\n\r\n    \"Illustrious prince [wrote the King of Hungary[18]], we cannot\r\n    sufficiently wonder that you should have been so gravely deceived\r\n    and that, after having once found that you were lured into loss\r\n    and disgrace, again you let yourself be snared in a labyrinth from\r\n    which you will either never escape, or escape only with damage and\r\n    shame.... Without risk to himself [your foe] has precipitated you\r\n    into an abyss and tied you where you are exposed to the loss of\r\n    your possessions and your life.... We exhort you to pause before\r\n    incurring heavier losses and greater dangers. If fortune smiles\r\n    upon you in your attack on that people, you will have the whole\r\n    empire against you. In the opposite event--which God avert--it\r\n    will be turned into a common tale how a mighty prince was overcome\r\n    by rustics whom there would have been no honour in conquering,\r\n    while to be conquered by them would be an eternal disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nThis plain-spoken epistle failed to reach its destination until after\r\nthe prophecy had been fulfilled. Its warning would probably have been\r\nfutile had Charles read it before he marched on towards Berne, on June\r\n8th. On the road that he chose lay the town of Morat, which had made\r\nready for his approach. A few days to reduce it, and then on to Berne\r\nwas his plan. His force succeeded in holding the ground and cutting\r\noff communication with Berne for three days. On the 14th, a messenger\r\nmade his way through from the beleaguered city to Berne, and all the\r\nallies were then urged to do their best. The result was encouraging.\r\n\"There are three times as many as at Granson, but let no one be\r\ndismayed, with God's help we will kill them all,\" wrote a leader of\r\nBerne.\r\n\r\nThe encounter came on June 23d. The force was really a formidable one.\r\nRené of Lorraine was among the commanders on the side of the Swiss.\r\nIt was a tremendous fight, brief as it was savage; at two o'clock the\r\nassault was made and within an hour Charles was repulsed. Almost all\r\nthe infantry perished. The slain is estimated variously from ten\r\nto twenty-two thousand. Charles did not keep his vow to perish if\r\ndefeated. To his assured allies he clung closely, and none had more\r\nreason to be faithful to him than Yolande of Savoy. After Granson he\r\nhastened to give the duchess his own view of the disaster:\r\n\r\n    \"It has given me a singular pleasure to hear of your calmness and\r\n    constancy of soul; for the thought of your affliction weighed more\r\n    heavily upon me than what has befallen me ... every day diminishes\r\n    the inconvenience and proves that the loss in men is less than we\r\n    thought. _Such as it is it came from a mere skirmish_. The bulk\r\n    of the armies did not engage, to my great displeasure. Had they\r\n    fought the victory would have been mine. There has been none on\r\n    either side. God, I trust, reserves it for you and for me ... the\r\n    hope you have placed in me shall not be vain.\"\r\n\r\nThus he wrote on March 7th to encourage his anxious protégée.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLAN OF THE BATTLE OF MORAT]\r\n\r\nAfter the second defeat it was to her that the duke turned again. In\r\nthe very early morning after the battle of Morat, Charles paused at\r\nMorges on the Lake of Geneva, having ridden hard through the night.\r\nThere he heard mass, breakfasted, rested awhile, and then rode on,\r\nreaching the castle of Gex at six o'clock in the evening, where\r\nYolande of Savoy was awaiting his coming in full knowledge of the\r\nsecond disaster he had suffered.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the staircase, attended by her ladies, Yolande was\r\nwaiting to greet her disappointed friend. Charles dismounted and\r\nkissed each member of the family in order of precedence, the little\r\nduke, his brother, then the duchess, her daughter, and the ladies\r\nin waiting. Yolande had had time to move out of her own suite of\r\napartments and have them prepared for her guest's use, and there the\r\ntwo talked together confidentially, while their attendants waited\r\npatiently just out of earshot.\r\n\r\nThen Charles formally escorted his hostess to her son's room,\r\nreturning to his own, showing signs of extreme fatigue. Panigarola\r\nwas absent, but another Milanese was among her suite, and he pressed\r\nforward as the duke re-entered the apartment, offering to carry any\r\nmessage to the Duke of Milan, to be cut short with, \"It is well. That\r\nis enough.\" Shortly afterwards, Olivier de la Marche and the Sire de\r\nGivry, commander of the Burgundians dedicated to Yolande's service,\r\nwere summoned and had a long conference with Charles.\r\n\r\nYolande was, apparently, more communicative to the Milanese Appiano\r\nthan to Charles, but he saw that she was not frank with him. \"She must\r\nthrow herself on the protection of France or of Milan,\" he wrote to\r\nhis master.[20] She was, however, clear in her own mind that she would\r\nnot accept Sforza's protection any more than that of Charles. She\r\nabsolutely refused to identify her fortunes with the latter. She was\r\ndetermined to go to Geneva, but no farther. The duke remained at Gex\r\nuntil the 27th, and renewed his arguments to persuade her to cross\r\nthe Jura with him. She was firm in adhering to her own plan. The\r\ntwo parties set out from the castle together, their roads lying in\r\nopposite directions, but Charles escorted his hostess about half-way\r\nto Geneva, riding beside her carriage, and continuing his persuasions\r\nin a low voice. At last he drew up his rein, gave her a farewell kiss,\r\nand rode off. He was much displeased at her determination, and he\r\nspeedily resolved upon other methods of making sure of her fidelity to\r\nhim. La Marche thus relates the story:[21]\r\n\r\n    \"After the duke had been discomfited the second time by the Swiss\r\n    before Morat, believing that he could do the thing secretly, he\r\n    made a plan to kidnap Mme. of Savoy and her children and take them\r\n    to Burgundy, and he ordered me, I being at Geneva, on my head to\r\n    capture Mme. of Savoy and her children and bring them to him. In\r\n    order to obey my prince and master I did his behest quite against\r\n    my heart, and I took madame and her children near the gate of\r\n    Geneva. But the Duke of Savoy was stolen away from me (for it was\r\n    two o'clock in the night) by the means of some of our own company\r\n    who were subjects of the Duke of Savoy, and, assuredly, they did\r\n    no more than their duty. What I did was simply to save my life,\r\n    for the duke, my master, was the kind that insisted on having his\r\n    will done under penalty of losing one's head. So I took my way,\r\n    and carried Mme. of Savoy behind me, and her two daughters\r\n    followed and two or three of her maids, and we took the road over\r\n    the mountain to reach St. Claude. I was well assured of the second\r\n    son, and had him carried by a gentleman. I thought I was assured\r\n    of the Duke of Savoy, but he was stolen from me as I said. As\r\n    soon as we were at a distance, the people of the duchess, and\r\n    especially the seigneur de Manton, had torches brought and took\r\n    the duke back to Geneva, in which they had great joy. And I with\r\n    Mme. of Savoy and the little boy (who was not the duke), crossed\r\n    the mountain in the black night and came to a place called Mijoux,\r\n    and thence to St. Claude.\r\n\r\n    \"You must know that the duke gave very bad cheer to the company,\r\n    and chiefly to me. I was in danger of my life because I had not\r\n    brought the Duke of Savoy. Then the duke went on to Salins without\r\n    speaking to me or giving me any orders. However, I escorted Mme.\r\n    of Savoy after him, and he ordered me to take her to the castle of\r\n    Rochefort. Thence she was taken to Rouvre in Burgundy. After that\r\n    I had nothing more to do with her or her affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThis queer story is undoubtedly true, and the tone in which La Marche\r\nrelates it indicates that he, too, was alienated by the duke's manner,\r\nand might have been more willing to lend an ear to Louis's suggestions\r\nthan he had been five years previously.\r\n\r\nIt is not evident that he played his master false or that he was\r\ncognisant of the recapture of the little duke, but he says himself\r\nthat he thought the attendants were absolutely justified in it.\r\n\r\nIt is after this incident that the astute Panigarola returns and joins\r\nthe duke's suite at Salins. He finds Charles a changed man, indulging\r\nin strange fits of hilarity, expressing the wish that a couple of\r\nthousand more of his troops had been killed, \"French at heart\" as they\r\nwere. He refused to see Yolande, after thus forcibly obtaining the\r\nmeans of so doing, and sent her to the castle of the Sire of Rochefort\r\nfor safe-keeping. Abstemious as he had been all his life, never taking\r\nwine without water, the strong Burgundy in which he now suddenly\r\nindulged went to his head.\r\n\r\nRumours went abroad that his mental balance was shaken. That does\r\nnot seem to have been true to the extent of insanity. He was only\r\ninfinitely chagrined but he certainly put on a brave front and\r\nretained his self-confidence and declared\r\n\r\n    \"They are wrong if they believe me defeated. Providence has\r\n    provided me with so many people and estates with such abundant\r\n    resources, that many such defeats would be needed to ruin them. At\r\n    the moment when the world imagines that I am annihilated, I will\r\n    reopen the campaign with an army of 150,000 men.\"[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Lettres de Louis XI_., v., 368.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Nos omnes relinquens, Ibid_., 371.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Commynes-Dupont, i., 336.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Lettres_, v., 363.

Flanders and Burgundy were, however,\r\nthe only quarters whence succour was in the least probable. The\r\nEstates of the latter duchy met, deliberated, and resolved to make no\r\npretence nor to \"yield anything contrary to the duty which every one\r\nowes to his country.\"[1] A certain Sieur de Jarville, accompanied\r\nby other true Burgundians, undertook to report the proceedings to\r\nCharles,--a duty usually falling to the share of the presiding officer\r\nof the ecclesiastical chamber. The message which he carried was\r\nlaconic but sturdy:\r\n\r\n\"Tell Monsieur that we are humble and brave subjects and servitors,\r\nbut as to what is asked in his behalf, it never has been done, it\r\ncannot be done, it never will be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Small people would never dare use such language,\" is the comment\r\nof the Burgundian chronicler, proud of the temerity of his fellow\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, the individual Estates were equally emphatic in\r\ntheir refusal to meet the duke's wishes. Charles, therefore, resolved\r\nto call together a general assembly of deputies in the hope of finding\r\nthem, collectively, more amenable. Writs of summons were issued very\r\nwidely and a \"States-general\" was formally convened at Ghent on\r\nFriday, April 26, 1476.[2] At the last assembly of this nature, in\r\n1473, the duke had expressly promised, in consideration of an annual\r\ngrant of 500,000 crowns for six years then accorded to him, to refrain\r\nfrom further demands, and there was a spirit of sullen resentment in\r\nthe air when this session, whose purpose was plain, was opened by\r\nChancellor Hugonet. He set forth three points for consideration.\r\nMonseigneur wished his daughter Mary, \"that most precious jewel,\" to\r\njoin him in Burgundy. A suitable escort was necessary to ensure her\r\nsafe journey and that the duke requested the States to provide.\r\nSecondly he desired the States to endorse a levy of fresh troops to\r\nmeet his immediate requirements. Further, he requested each town to\r\nequip a specified number of horses at its own expense; he demanded the\r\nservice of his tenants, fief and arrière-fief; and, in addition, he\r\nrequired that all other men, no matter what their condition, able to\r\nbear arms, should enlist or provide a substitute. A portion of the\r\ntroops should be set to guard the frontier, and the rest should be\r\nsent to the duke in Burgundy.\r\n\r\nIt was a demand pure and simple for a universal call to arms, a\r\nnational levy. The duke's paternal desire to see his daughter was the\r\nflimsiest of excuses that deceived no one for a moment.\r\n\r\nAfter the chancellor's exposition there was probably adjournment for\r\ndiscussion. The pensionary of Brussels, Gort Roelants, then acted as\r\nspokesman to present the following report, as the result of their\r\ndeliberations, to the duchess-regent.\r\n\r\nAs for Mlle. of Burgundy, the deputies would ascertain the wishes\r\nof their principals, but the second request did not call for a\r\nreferendum. The representatives were fully capable of settling the\r\nmatter at once. Considering the heavy burdens laid on the people, and\r\ntaking into account the promises made to them in 1473, that no\r\nfurther demands should be made on the public purse, the three Estates\r\nconcurred in humbly petitioning Monseigneur to excuse them from\r\ngranting his request.\r\n\r\nIt was on a Sunday after dinner (April 28th) when this decision was\r\ncommunicated to the duchess in her own hotel. After a private colloquy\r\nbetween her and Hugonet, the chancellor told the messenger that it was\r\nquite right for the deputies to consult their principals before the\r\nheiress was permitted to leave the guardianship of her faithful\r\nsubjects. That was a grave matter, but surely there was no reason why\r\nher \"escort\" could not be determined upon at once. In regard to the\r\nlevies, Madame was not empowered to take any excuse. It was beyond her\r\nprovince. Since the opening of the assembly, fresh letters had\r\narrived from the duke urging the speedy execution of his previous\r\ninstructions. The chancellor then appointed a committee to meet a\r\ncommittee from the States at 8 A.M. on the morrow at the convent of\r\nthe Augustines.\r\n\r\nThis was not satisfactory. Hugonet was speedily notified that the\r\nStates did not feel empowered to appoint a committee. The most they\r\ncould do was to resolve themselves into a committee of the whole. The\r\nobjection to this was that a small conference was far better suited\r\nto free discussion. It was easy for unqualified persons to enter the\r\nsession of a large body. The States, however, were tenacious in their\r\nopinion that their writs did not qualify them to appoint committees.\r\nEvery point must be threshed out in the presence of every deputy.\r\n_Potestas delegata non deleganda est_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIBERT, DUKE OF SAVOY (AFTER THE DESIGN BY MATHEY)]\r\n\r\nThere was further negotiation, and it was not until Monday afternoon\r\nthat Hugonet's commissioner brought a conciliatory message that if the\r\ngentlemen were so bent on it, he would, in spite of the difficulty of\r\ndiscussion in an open meeting, talk over both points with them in\r\nfull assembly. Again the States objected. They had no instructions\r\nwhatsoever in regard to Mademoiselle, and could not discuss her\r\nmovements either in public or in private session. As to levies, they\r\nrepeated in detail all previous arguments, and expressed a fervent\r\nhope that Monseigneur would withdraw the request. It would, in the\r\nend, be more to Monseigneur's advantage, etc. Back and forth travelled\r\nthe commissioner between States and duchess. The latter simply\r\nreiterated her dictum that Mary must certainly set forth to visit her\r\nfather in May, with an adequate escort, in whose ranks must appear\r\nthree prelates, three or four barons, fifty knights, and notable men\r\nfrom the \"good towns,\" well armed.\r\n\r\nThe States were then resolved into a committee of the whole, for a\r\nprivate deliberation, an action that probably enabled them to exclude\r\nthe embarrassing spectators. In preparation for this, the diligent\r\ncommissioner called apart one deputy from each contingent, and\r\nexpatiated on the duke's need of proof of sturdy loyalty. Seven to\r\neight thousand combatants, besides Mademoiselle's escort and the fiefs\r\nand arrière-fiefs, Monseigneur could manage to make suffice for the\r\npresent, and these must be provided. These confidences were at once\r\nreported to the assembly, which then adjourned to think over the\r\nmatter during the night.[3]\r\n\r\nWhen they met again on April 30th, the chancellor was ready with a new\r\nmessage from Madame: \"Go home now, consult your principals, and return\r\non May 15th.\" On the motion of some deputy, this date was changed to\r\nMay 24th. Precautions were taken to prevent any binding action in the\r\ninterim. Moreover, the exact phrasing of the reports to the separate\r\ngroups of constituents was also agreed upon by the majority of the\r\ndeputies. In this, Hainaut refused to participate, as in that province\r\nthere was a reluctance to deny the obligations of the fiefs.\r\n\r\nWhen the deputies reassembled a month later, Hugonet tried to weaken\r\nthe effect of their answer by a suggestion that it had better not\r\nbe considered the final decision, but a mere informal expression of\r\nopinion. \"There were so many strangers present,\" etc. The States\r\ndeterminedly refused to be trifled with. \"Madame must not be\r\ndispleased if they gave the result of their deliberations in the\r\npresence of the whole assembly, not by way of opinion, but as a formal\r\nand conclusive report.\" Their charge was restricted to this manner\r\nof procedure. The chancellor, interrupting them, asked, since their\r\ncharge was thus restricted, whether they had also been limited in the\r\nnumber of times they might drink on their way.[4] The answer was:\r\n\"Chancellor, come now, say what you wish. The answer shall be given as\r\nit was meant to be given.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF BATTLE OF NANCY. REPRODUCED FROM KIRK'S\r\n\"CHARLES THE BOLD,\" BY PERMISSION OF J.B. LIPPINCOTT CO.]\r\n\r\nThe communication was so long that its delivery took from 3 to 8\r\nP.M. It was nothing more than a detailed apology for refusing the\r\nsovereign's demands. Several days more were consumed in unsuccessful\r\nefforts to cajole or browbeat the deputies into a more genial mood.\r\nThe only concessions offered were insignificant, and to their\r\nresolution the deputies held firmly. \"According to current rumour\r\n[concludes Gort Roelants's story] the ducal council would gladly have\r\naccepted a notable sum in lieu of the service of towns and of the\r\nfiefholders, but the States made no such offer.\"\r\n\r\nThere was evidently a hope that better results might be obtained from\r\na new assembly,[5] but none was held and the most earnest endeavours\r\nof the duke's wife and daughter failed to arouse enthusiasm for his\r\nplans. Moreover, when there seemed a prospect that the Netherlands\r\nmight be attacked from France, the sympathy of even the duchess and\r\ncouncil for offensive operations was chilled. Not only did Margaret\r\nfail to send her husband the extra supplies demanded, but she decided\r\nto appropriate the three months' subsidy, the chief item of regular\r\nducal revenue, for protection of the Flemish frontier--an action that\r\nmade Charles very angry. Defences at home! Yes, indeed, they were\r\nnecessary, but the people must provide them. The subsidy was lawfully\r\nhis and he needed every penny of it. His army had not been destroyed.\r\nHe was simply obliged to strengthen it. Burgundy was helping him.\r\nFlanders must do her part. They were deaf to this appeal, although a\r\ngenerous message was sent saying that if he were hard pressed they\r\nwould go in person to rescue him from danger.\r\n\r\nThe story of the assembly of the Estates of the two Burgundies is\r\nequally interesting as a picture of the clash between sovereign will\r\nand popular unreadiness to open the carefully guarded money-boxes.[6]\r\nThe deputies convened at Salins on July 8th, in the presence of the\r\nduke himself. The session was opened by Jean de Grey, the president\r\nof the _parlement_ of the duchy, with a brief statement of the\r\nsovereign's needs. Then Charles took the floor, and delivered a\r\ntremendous harangue with a marvellous command of language. Panigarola\r\ndeclared that his allusions to parallel crises in ancient times were\r\nso apt and so fluent that it seemed as though the book of history lay\r\nopened before him and that he read from its pages.[7] The impression\r\nhe made was plain to see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF NANCY CONTEMPORANEOUS MINIATURE IN ABBEY OF\r\nST. GERMAIN DES PRÉS (COMINES-LENGLET, III.)]\r\n\r\nHis demands for aid to retrieve the Swiss disasters were open and\r\naboveboard this time. There was no such pretence put forward as the\r\nescort of Mary. The argument was that any ruler, backed by his people\r\nunanimous in their willingness to give their last jewel for public\r\npurposes, must inevitably succeed in his righteous wars, etc.\r\n\r\nHis learned and able discourse was well received, according to other\r\nreporters besides the Milanese, but there was no hearty yielding to\r\nsentiment in the reply. Four days were consumed in deliberation before\r\nthat was ready on July 12th. They had certainly considered that the\r\ngrant of 100,000 florins annually for six years, accorded two years\r\npreviously, was their share. But in view of the duke's appeal, they\r\nwould endeavour to aid him. Let him stipulate which cities he wished\r\nfortified and they would assume charge of the work. Two favours they\r\nbegged--that Charles should not rashly expose his person \"for he was\r\nthe sole prince of his glorious House,\" and that he should be ready\r\nto receive overtures of peace. \"We will give life and property for\r\ndefence, but we implore you to take no offensive step.\" Charles did\r\nnot, perhaps, feel the distrust of his military skill and of his\r\njudgment that these words implied.\r\n\r\nFinancial stress was not the duke's only difficulty in 1476. The\r\ndefection of his allies continued, Yolande--that former good friend of\r\nhis--was now a fervent suppliant to Louis XI., begging him to restore\r\nher to freedom and to her son's estates. Not that her restraint was\r\nin itself hard to bear. At Rouvre, whither she had been removed from\r\nRochefort, she was free to do what she wished, except to depart.\r\nCouriers, too, were at her service apparently, who carried uninspected\r\nletters to Milan, Geneva, Nice, Turin, and to Louis XI. Commines\r\nsays that she hesitated to take refuge with the last lest he should\r\npromptly return her to Burgundian \"protection.\" Yet her brother's\r\nhatred to Charles seemed a fairly strong assurance against such\r\naction. Louis XI. was never so genial as when hearing some ill of\r\nCharles. \"From what I have learned, I believe his Turk, his devil\r\nin this world, the person he loathes most intensely, is the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, with whom he can never live in amity.\" These words were sent\r\nby Petrasanta to the Duke of Milan,[8] who was also turning slowly,\r\nwith some periods of hesitation, to an alliance with Louis, now\r\nengaged in \"following the hare with a cart.\"[9]\r\n\r\nOn his side the king declared that he had no intention of troubling\r\nfurther about his obligations to the Duke of Burgundy. \"He has himself\r\nbroken the truce repeatedly. I can begin a war when I please. But I\r\nhave thought it best to temporise.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMN COMMEMORATING CHARLES AT NANCY AFTER THE DRAWING\r\nBY PERNOT]\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding weeks Louis plunged deeper and deeper into\r\nnegotiations with any and every one whom he could turn against\r\nCharles. In October, Sire de Chamont, governor of Champagne, --the\r\nterritory that Edward IV. had failed to consign to the duke's\r\nsovereignty,--made a descent on Rouvre and rescued Yolande of Savoy.\r\nThere was no attempt to stay her departure, and she was scrupulous, so\r\nit is said, in leaving money behind to pay for the Burgundian property\r\ncarried off in her train--though it were nothing but an old crossbow.\r\n\"Welcome, Madame the Burgundian,\" was the fraternal salutation which\r\nshe received on her arrival at her brother's court. She replied that\r\nshe was a good French woman and quite ready to obey his majesty's\r\ncommands.[10]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, Charles remained at La Rivière exerting every\r\neffort to levy an army. It was no easy task, and the review held on\r\nJuly 27th showed a meagre return for his exertions. But he did not\r\nslacken his efforts. Lists were immediately drawn up showing the\r\nvacancies in each company, and his money stress did not prevent\r\nhis offering increased pay as an extra inducement to recruits. \"An\r\nexcellent means of encouragement,\" comments Panigarola.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for his preparations was evident. An opportune legacy\r\ninherited by René of Lorraine enabled that dispossessed prince to work\r\nto better advantage than he had been able to do since Charles had\r\nconvened the Estates of Lorraine at Nancy. Moreover, on the very day\r\nof the review of the deficient Burgundian troops, a Swiss diet at\r\nFribourg adopted resolutions regarding, a closer alliance with\r\nRené.[11] Louis XI. ostensibly maintained his truce with Charles but\r\nhe had intimated that a French army would wait in Dauphiné ready \"to\r\nhelp adjust the affairs of Savoy,\" and, at about the same time when\r\nYolande was at court, he gave a gracious reception to a Swiss embassy,\r\nso that René did not feel himself without support as he advanced to\r\nrecover his city.\r\n\r\nThe mercenaries left by Charles at Nancy were weak and indifferent--a\r\nbrief siege, and the capital of Lorraine capitulated to Duke René.\r\nCharles was too late to prevent this mortifying loss. His forces, too,\r\nwere a mere shadow. Three to four thousand men rallied round him in\r\nthe Franche-Comté, a few hundred joined him in Burgundy, and as he\r\nskirted the frontier of Champagne he received slight reinforcements\r\nfrom Luxemburg. Then came Campobasso and his mercenary troops, and\r\nthe Count of Chimay with such Flemish fiefs as had, individually,\r\nrespected the duke's appeal. In all, the forces at Charles's\r\ndisposition amounted to about ten thousand, far fewer than those at\r\nNeuss or at Granson.\r\n\r\nAt a diet of October 17th, the compact between René and the Swiss was\r\nconfirmed, and the former was assured of efficient aid to help him\r\nrepulse Charles in his advance into Lorraine. There was need. The city\r\nof Toul refused admission to both dukes, but furnished provision for\r\nCharles's troops, so that for the moment he was the better off of the\r\ntwo. René then proceeded to provision Nancy and to prepare it for a\r\nsiege, while he himself proceeded to Pont-à-Mousson, and for several\r\ndays the two adversaries were only separated by the Moselle. Charles's\r\narmy was augmented daily by slight accessions from Flanders, and\r\nEngland, and by fragments of the garrisons of the towns in Lorraine\r\nthat had yielded to René and the latter fell back, little by little.\r\nCharles in his turn held Pont-à-Mousson, and proceeded along the road\r\nto Nancy, not deterred by the Lorrainers.\r\n\r\nIt was on October 22nd, that Charles of Burgundy laid siege for the\r\nsecond time to Nancy. In thus entering into active hostilities, he was\r\nignoring the advice of his councillors who were unanimous in begging\r\nhim to devote the winter months to refitting his army in Luxemburg or\r\nFlanders. His position was really very dangerous. He had no base on\r\nwhich to rest as he had recovered no towns except Pont-à-Mousson. But\r\nhe ignored the patent obstacles and tried assault after assault upon\r\nNancy--all most valiantly repulsed. Within the walls, there was an\r\namazing display of courage, energy, and good humour. As a matter of\r\nfact, the duke's reputation had waned, while the fear of his cruelty\r\nemboldened the burghers to hold out to the last ditch. Any fate would\r\nbe better than falling into his hands, was the general opinion.\r\n\r\nThroughout Lorraine, the captains of the garrisons seized every\r\noccasion to harry the Burgundians. Familiar with the lay of the land,\r\nwith every cross-road and by-path, they were able to lie in wait for\r\nthe foragers and to do much damage. Four hundred cavaliers, coming\r\nup from Burgundy, were attacked by one Malhortie de Rozière, and\r\nliterally cut to pieces, while their horses changed sides with ease.\r\nOnly a few escaped to report the fate of the others to Charles. Not\r\nlong after, Malhortie, encouraged by this success, crept up to the\r\nBurgundian camp, fell upon the sleepers, and captured a goodly number\r\nof horses.\r\n\r\nThe troops on which Charles counted most confidently were\r\nCampobasso's. Several attempts were made to warn him that treachery\r\nwas possible in that quarter if the commander were too much\r\nexasperated by delays in payment, too much tried by the ill-temper of\r\nhis employer. But the duke persisted in being oblivious to what was\r\npassing under his eyes. Thus, while awaiting the moment for his final\r\ndefection, the Italian found it possible to enter into communication\r\nwith René and to retard the operations of the siege so as to give time\r\nfor the advance of the army of relief.\r\n\r\nThe weather of this year was a marked contrast to the mild season of\r\n1473. The winter set in early and the cold became very severe, almost\r\nat once. Their sufferings made the burghers very impatient for the\r\nrelief of whose coming they could get no certain assurance. The\r\nBurgundian lines were held so rigidly that the interchange of messages\r\nbetween the city and her friends was rendered very difficult.[12] One\r\nSuffren de Baschi tried to slip through to Nancy, to tell the besieged\r\nthat René was levying troops in Switzerland and would soon be with\r\nthem. Baschi fell into the duke's hands and was immediately hanged.\r\nOne story says that Campobasso was among the interceders for his life\r\nand received a box on the ear for his pains, an insult that proved the\r\nlast straw in his allegiance to Charles. Commines, however, declares\r\nthat the Italian urged the death of the captive, fearful of the\r\npremature betrayal of his own intended treachery.\r\n\r\nThis execution was one of those arbitrary acts condemned by public\r\nopinion as contrary to the code of warfare. Intense indignation among\r\nthe Lorrainers and the Swiss forced René to retaliatory measures, and\r\nhe ordered the execution of all the Burgundian prisoners. One hundred\r\nand twenty bodies hung on the gibbets, each bearing an inscription\r\nto the effect that their death was the work of _le téméraire_. The\r\nrancour of the proceedings became terrible. No quarter was given in\r\nany engagements. Slaughter was the only thought on either side.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of December, one Thierry, a draper of Mirecourt,\r\nproved more successful than Baschi in reaching Nancy. His information,\r\nthat René's army would leave Basel on December 26th, put heart into\r\nthe beseiged and the bells rang out joyfully.\r\n\r\nJust at this epoch, there was an attempt at mediation between the\r\ncombatants. The King of Portugal,[13] nephew of Isabella, appeared at\r\nhis cousin's camp and implored him to put an end to the carnage, and\r\nin the name of humanity to stop a war that was horrible to all the\r\nworld. In spite of his own stress, Charles managed to give his kinsman\r\na splendid reception, but he waved aside his petition, and simply\r\ninvited him to join him in his campaign.\r\n\r\nA week sufficed for the Swiss contingent to march from Basel to Nancy,\r\nacross the plains of Alsace. Meantime René had rallied about four\r\nthousand men under Lorraine captains, and to this was added an\r\nAlsatian force which had joined him by way of St.-Nicolas-du-Port.\r\nThey were a rude, pitiless crowd, as they soon evinced by routing\r\na few Burgundians out of the houses where they had hidden, and\r\nmassacring them publicly. A reconnaissance, sent out by Charles, was\r\neasily put to flight.\r\n\r\nOn January 4th, Charles learned that fresh troops had reached St.\r\nNicolas. He showed assurance, arrogance, and negligence. His belief in\r\nhis star was fully restored. He actually did not take the trouble to\r\ntry once more to ascertain the exact strength of the enemy. He had\r\ncommissioned the Bishop of Forli to negotiate for him at Basel, and\r\nrefused to credit the statement that the Swiss were throwing in their\r\nfortunes with René. He thought that \"the Child,\" as he contemptuously\r\ntermed his adversary, had simply gone right and left to hire\r\nmercenaries, and he rather ridiculed the idea of taking such\r\n_canaille_ seriously, saying that it was a host unworthy of a\r\ngentleman. Still he resolved to meet and finish them once for all.[14]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that the Swiss reinforcements were a different and far\r\nless efficient body than the volunteers of Granson and Morat had been.\r\nFrench gold, scattered freely, had done its work in exciting the\r\ncupidity of every man who could bear arms. There were some staunch\r\nleaders, like Waldemar of Zurich and Rudolph de Stein, but their kind\r\nwas in the minority. Berne aided with money rather than with men, but\r\nshe was not a generous ally as she insisted on having hostages to\r\nensure her repayment. A venal spirit was evident in every quarter. As\r\nthe troops made their way over the Jura their behaviour showed that\r\nthe late splendid booty had affected them. Plunder was their aim. When\r\nRené reviewed these fresh arrivals from Basel, one of his attending\r\nofficers was Oswald von Thierstein, late governor of Alsace.[15]\r\nDisgraced by Sigismund he had passed over to the Duke of Lorraine, who\r\nappointed him marshal.\r\n\r\nOn that January 4th, a Saturday, Charles held a council meeting. The\r\nopinion of the wisest, already given on previous occasions, was urged\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n    \"Do not risk battle. René is poor. If there are no immediate\r\n    engagements, his mercenaries will abandon him for lack of pay.\r\n    Raise the siege and depart for Flanders and Luxemburg. The army\r\n    can rest and be increased. Then at the approach of spring it will\r\n    be easy to fall upon René deprived of his troops.\"\r\n\r\nCharles was absolutely deaf to these arguments. He was determined on\r\nfacing the issue at once. Leaving a small force to sustain the siege,\r\nhe ordered the camp to be broken on the evening of the 4th and a\r\nmovement made towards St.-Nicolas. He selected a ground favourable\r\nfor the manipulation of a large body, and placed his artillery on a\r\nplateau situated between Jarville and Neuville. It was not a good\r\nposition, being hedged in on the right and in front by woods which\r\ncould conceal the movements of a foe without impeding them. Only one\r\nway of retreat was open--towards Metz, whose bishop was Charles's\r\nlast ally. But to reach Metz, it was necessary to cross several small\r\nstreams and deceptive marshes, half frozen as they were, besides the\r\nriver Meurthe, a serious obstacle with the garrison of Nancy on the\r\nflank. In short, there was ample reason to dread surprise, while\r\nin case of defeat a terrible catastrophe was more than possible.\r\nCuriously, the precise kind of difficulties which beset the field of\r\nMorat were repeated here--proof that Charles had not the qualities of\r\na general who could learn by experience.[16]\r\n\r\nThe exact force at his disposal on this occasion has been variously\r\nestimated. Considering the ravages of the sanguinary skirmishes during\r\nthe siege, and of the cold, it is probable that the actual combatants\r\ndid not number more than ten thousand, all told. And only half of\r\nthese were of any value--two thousand men under Galeotto, and\r\nthree thousand Burgundians commanded by Charles and his immediate\r\nlieutenants. The remainder were unreliable mercenaries and the still\r\nmore unreliable troops of Campobasso already pledged to the foe. La\r\nMarche estimates René's force at twelve thousand and adds: \"The Duke\r\nof Burgundy was far behind, for, on my conscience, he had not two\r\nthousand fighting men.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThe allies adopted a plan of battle proposed by a Lorrainer, Vautrin\r\nWuisse. The first manoeuvre was to divert the foe and turn him towards\r\nthe woods, and then to attack his centre, which would at the same\r\ntime be pressed at the front by the Lorraine forces, headed by René\r\nhimself. The plan succeeded in every point. Surprised that they dared\r\ntake the offensive, Charles was alert to the harsh cries of the \"bull\"\r\nof Uri and the \"cow\" of Unterwalden, which were heard across the\r\nwoods. A sudden presentiment saddened him. Putting on his helmet, he\r\naccidentally knocked off the lion bearing the legend _Hoc est signum\r\nDei_. He replaced it and plunged into the mêlée.\r\n\r\nThe onslaught was terrific. Galeotto's troops and the duke's were the\r\nonly ones to make sturdy resistance. The right wing of the army gave\r\nway under the fierce assault of the Swiss. The cry, \"_Sauve qui\r\npent_!\" raised possibly by Campobasso's traitors, produced a terrible\r\nrout. Three quarters of the troops were in flight, while the duke\r\nstill fought on with superhuman ferocity.\r\n\r\nGaleotto, seeing that the day was lost, protected his own mercenaries\r\nas best he could, while Campobasso completed the treason that he had\r\nplotted with René, which had been partially accomplished four days\r\npreviously, and calmly took up his position on the bridge of Bouxières\r\non the Meurthe, to make prisoners for the sake of ransom. Then the\r\nbesieged made a sudden sortie which increased the disorder. The battle\r\nproper was of short duration, with little bloodshed, but the pursuit\r\nwas sanguinary in the extreme, because the Burgundian army had left no\r\nloophole open for retreat.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss pursued the fugitives hotly as far as Bouxières and\r\ninflicted carnage right and left on the route. It was easy work. The\r\nmorasses were traps and the Burgundians, encumbered with their arms,\r\nfound it impossible to free themselves, when they once were entangled.\r\nThey fell like flies before the fury of the mountaineers. The\r\nLorrainers and Alsatians were more humane or more mercenary, for they\r\ntook prisoners instead of killing indiscriminately. Charles fought\r\ndesperately to the very end. There is no doubt that he plunged into\r\nthe thick of the fight and risked his life in a reckless manner,\r\nbut there is absolute uncertainty as to how he met his death. It is\r\ngenerally accepted that the last person to see him alive was one\r\nBaptista Colonna, a page in the service of a Neapolitan captain. This\r\nlad, with an extra helmet swung over his shoulder, found himself\r\nclose to the duke. He saw him surrounded by troops, noticed his horse\r\nstumble, was sure that the rider fell. The next moment, Colonna's\r\nattention was diverted to himself. He was taken prisoner and knew no\r\nmore of the day's events. The figure of Charles of Burgundy disappears\r\nfrom the view of man. A curtain woven of vague rumour hides the\r\nclosing scenes of his life.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock the victorious Duke of Lorraine rode into the rescued\r\ncity and re-entered his palace. At the gates was heaped up a ghastly\r\nmemorial of the steadfastness of the burghers in their devotion to\r\nhis cause. This was a pile of the bones of the foul animals they had\r\nconsumed when other food was exhausted, rather than capitulate to\r\ntheir liege's foe. To ascertain the fate of that foe now became René's\r\nchief anxiety, and he despatched messengers to Metz and elsewhere\r\nto find out where Charles had taken refuge. The reports were all\r\nnegative. The first positive assurance that the duke was dead came\r\nfrom young Baptista Colonna, whom Campobasso himself introduced into\r\nRené's presence on Monday evening. The page told his tale and declared\r\nthat he could point out the precise place where he had seen the Duke\r\nof Burgundy fall. Accordingly, on Tuesday morning, January 7th, a\r\nparty went forth from Nancy to the desolate battlefield and were\r\nguided by Colonna to the edge of a pool which he asserted confidently\r\nwas the very spot where he had seen Charles. Circumstantial evidence\r\nwent to give corroboration to his word, for the dozen or more bodies\r\nthat lay strewn along the ground in the immediate vicinity of the pool\r\nwere close friends and followers of the duke, men who would, in all\r\nprobability, have stayed faithfully by their master's person, a\r\nvolunteer bodyguard as long as they drew breath. These bodies were all\r\nstripped naked. Harpies had already gathered what plunder they could\r\nfind, and no apparel or accoutrements were left to show the difference\r\nin rank between noble and page. But the faces were recognisable and\r\nthey were identified as well-known nobles of the Burgundian court.\r\nSeparated from this group by a little space at the very edge of the\r\npool, was another naked body in still more doleful plight. The face\r\nwas disfigured beyond all semblance of what it might have been in\r\nlife. One cheek was bitten by wolves, one was imbedded in the frozen\r\nslime. Yet there was evidence on the poor forsaken remains that\r\nconvinced the searchers that this was indeed the mortal part of the\r\ngreat duke. Two wounds from a pick and a blow above the ear--inflicted\r\nby \"one named Humbert\"--showed how death had been caused. The missing\r\nteeth corresponded to those lost by Charles, there was a scar just\r\nwhere he had received his wound at Montl'héry, the finger nails were\r\nlong like his, a wound on the shoulder, a fistula on the groin, and an\r\ningrowing nail were additional marks of identification,--six definite\r\nproofs in all. Among those who gazed at this wretched sight, on that\r\nJanuary morning, were men intimately acquainted with the duke's\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n    \"There were his physician, a Portuguese named Mathieu, and his\r\n    valets, besides Olivier de la Marche[18] and Denys his chaplain\r\n    who were taken thither and there was no doubt that he was dead. It\r\n    has not yet been decided where he will be buried, and to know it\r\n    better it [the body] has been bathed in warm water and good wine\r\n    and cleansed. In that state it was recognisable by all who\r\n    had previously seen and known him. The page who had given the\r\n    information was taken to the king. Had it not been for him it\r\n    would never have been known what had become of him considering the\r\n    state and the place where he was found.\"[19]\r\n\r\nBefore the body could be freed from the ice in which it was imbedded,\r\nimplements had to be brought from Nancy. Four Lorraine nobles hastened\r\nto the spot, when they heard the tidings, to show honour to the man\r\nwho had been their accepted lord for a brief period, and they acted\r\nas escort as the burden was carried into the town and placed in a\r\nsuitable chamber in the home of one George Marquiez. There seems to\r\nhave been no insult offered to the fallen man, no lack of deference in\r\nthe proceedings. The very spot where the bier rested for a moment was\r\nmarked with a little black cross.\r\n\r\nAs the corpse was bathed, three wounds became evident--a deep cut\r\nfrom a halberd in the head, spear thrusts through the thighs and\r\nabdomen--proofs of the closeness of the last struggle. When all the\r\ndignity possible had been given to the miserable human fragment and\r\nthe chamber hung with conventional mourning, René came thither clad\r\nin black garments. Kneeling by the bier, he said: \"Would to God, fair\r\ncousin, that your misfortunes and mine had not reduced you to the\r\ncondition in which I see you.\"\r\n\r\nFor five days the body lay in state before the high altar of the\r\nchurch of St. George, and the obsequies that followed were attended by\r\nRené and his nobles, and the coffin was honourably placed among the\r\nducal dead.\r\n\r\nYet doubt of the man's existence was not buried with the bones to\r\nwhich his name was given. When the Swiss turned their way homeward,\r\ntheir farewell words to René were: \"If the Duke of Burgundy has\r\nescaped and should reopen war, tell us.\" \"If he has assured his\r\nsafety,\" René answered, \"we will fight again when summer comes.\" There\r\nwas no delay, however, in the division of the spoils. The Burgundian\r\ntreasure was distributed among René's allies, and the ignorant\r\nsoldiers received articles worth many times their pay, which they, in\r\nmany cases, disposed of for an infinitesimal part of their value.\r\n\r\nAs late as January 28th, Margaret of York and Mary of Burgundy wrote\r\nto Louis XI. from Ghent:\r\n\r\n\"We are still hoping that Monseigneur is alive in the hands of his\r\nenemies.\" Other rumours continued to be current, not only for weeks\r\nbut for years. In 1482, it was gravely recounted that the vanished\r\nduke had retired to Brucsal in Swabia, where he led an austere life,\r\n_genus vitae horridum atque asperum_. Bets were made, too, on the\r\nchances of his return.[20]\r\n\r\nLouis XI. was a very pleasant person when news was brought him that he\r\nliked to hear. Commines and Bouchage together had told him about the\r\ndefeat of Morat and had each received two hundred silver marks. It was\r\na Seigneur de Lude who had the good luck to bring him letters from\r\nCraon recounting the battle of Nancy. It was \"really difficult for the\r\nking to keep his countenance so surprised was he with joy.\"[21] His\r\nletter to Craon was written on January 9th and ran as follows.[22]\r\n\r\n    \"M. the Count, my friend, I have received your letter and heard\r\n    the good news that you impart to me, for which I thank you as much\r\n    as I can. Now is the time to use all your five natural senses to\r\n    deliver the duchy and county of Burgundy into my hands. If the\r\n    duke be dead, do you and the governor of Champagne take your\r\n    troops and put yourselves within the land, and, if you love me,\r\n    keep as good order among your men as if you were in Paris, and\r\n    prove that I mean to treat them [the Burgundians] better than any\r\n    one in my realm.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"five natural senses\" of the king's lieutenant were employed most\r\nloyally to his master's service. The duchy of Burgundy returned to the\r\nFrench crown. Before Easter, the Estates were convened by Louis XI,\r\nand there was no longer any duke in Burgundy to be an over powerful\r\npeer in France.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Guelders the lands acquired by Charles fell\r\naway, but the remainder as inherited by him passed under the rule of\r\nhis daughter Mary, who carried her heritage into the House of Austria,\r\nthrough which it passed finally to the King of Spain.\r\n\r\nOn that fatal fifth of January, Charles of Burgundy had only just\r\npassed middle life. He was forty-four years, one month, and twenty-six\r\ndays old, an age when a man has the right to look forward to new\r\nachievements. Every circumstance of the dreary and premature death was\r\nin glaring contrast to his prospects at his birth in 1433, in insolent\r\ncontradiction to his own estimation of the obligations assumed by Fate\r\nin his behalf. In certain details of the catastrophe there are, of\r\ncourse, accidents. No one could have predicted that the duke whose\r\nchief title was a synonym for magnificence, that this cherished heir\r\nto his House, who had been bathed in all the luxury known to his\r\nepoch, should have thus lain in death, many hours long, unattended and\r\nuncared-for, naked and frozen on a bed of congealed mud, with a winter\r\nsky as canopy. The actual adversity as it overwhelmed him was too\r\nappalling for any foresight. But the great dream of the man's life\r\nthat vanished with his vitality owed its annihilation to no mere\r\nchance of warfare. Had it not been rudely ended by the battle of\r\nNancy, other means of destruction, inevitable and sure, would have\r\nappeared. The projected erection of a solidified kingdom stretching\r\nfrom the North Sea to Switzerland and possibly to the Mediterranean,\r\none that could hold the balance of power between France and Germany,\r\ncontained elements of disintegration, latent at its foundation. It is\r\nclear, from a consideration of the Duke of Burgundy and his position\r\nin the Europe of his time, that the materials which he expected to\r\nmould into a realm were a collection of sentient units. Each separate\r\none was instinct with individual life, individual desires, conscious\r\nof its own minute past, capable of directing its own contracted\r\nfuture. That the hereditary title of overlord to each political unity\r\nhad lodged upon a head already dignified by a plurality of similar\r\ntitles, was a mere chance and viewed by the burghers in a wholly\r\ndifferent light from that in which this same overlord regarded it. The\r\nfishers in Holland, the manufacturers in Brabant, the merchants in\r\nFlanders, the vintners in Burgundy, cared nothing for being the wings\r\nof an imperial idea. They wanted safe fishing grounds, unmolested\r\nhighways of commerce, vineyards free from the tramp of armies. And\r\nwith their desires fixed on these as needful, their attitude towards\r\nthe political centralisation planned by their common ruler, often\r\nbetrayed both ignorance and inconsistency. At various epochs some\r\ndegree of imperialism for the Netherland group had been quite to\r\npopular taste. In Holland, Zealand and Hainaut, it had been conceded\r\nthat Jacqueline of Bavaria was less efficient to maintain desirable\r\nconditions than her cousin of Burgundy, and the exchange of sovereigns\r\nhad been effected in spite of the manifest injustice involved in the\r\ntransaction. But while there was willingness to accept any advantages\r\nthat might accrue to a people from the reputation of a local overlord,\r\nit was never forgotten for an instant that his relation to his\r\nsubjects was as their own count and strictly limited by conditions\r\nthat had long existed within each petty territory. While Charles\r\nseemed to be on the straight road towards his goal, the people within\r\neach body politic of his inherited states were profoundly preoccupied\r\nwith their own local concerns, and only alive to his schemes when they\r\nfeared demands upon their internal revenues for external purposes.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem probable, however, that the abstract question of the\r\nprojected kingdom was ever taken very seriously among those to be\r\ndirectly affected by the proposed change. The bars interposed by his\r\nown subjects in the duke's progress towards royalty were obstructions\r\nto his successive steps rather than to his theory. Indeed, strenuous\r\nopposition to details was allied to a vague and passive acceptance of\r\nthe whole. Moreover when the idea was phrased it was distinctly as\r\na revival, not as a novelty. The previous existence of a kingdom of\r\nBurgundy was undoubtedly a potent factor in the degree of progress\r\nmade by Charles towards conjuring into new life a reincarnation of\r\nthat ancient realm. Yet it was a factor clothed with a shadow rather\r\nthan with the substance of truth. Geographically there was very little\r\nin common between the dominion projected more or less definitely in\r\n1473 and any one of the kingdoms of Burgundy as they had successively\r\nexisted. That of Charles corresponded very nearly to the ancient\r\nkingdom of Lorraine. Franche-Comté was the only ground common to the\r\nterritories actually held by the duke and to the latest kingdom of\r\nBurgundy. His possessions in Picardy and Alsace lay wholly beyond the\r\nlimits of either Burgundy or Lorraine. But the old name survived in\r\nhis ducal title, and it was that name that lent a semblance of reality\r\nto this fifteenth-century dream of a middle kingdom as outlined in the\r\nduke's mind more or less definitely or as bounded by his ambition.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect it is clear that more was requisite for the realisation\r\nof the vision of the wished-for nation, than imperial investiture of\r\na crowned monarch with sovereignty over a group of lands. A modern\r\nwriter has pointed out how infinitely subtle is the vital principle\r\nof a nation, one not even to be created by common interests. A\r\n_Zollverein_ is no _patria_. An element of sentiment is needful, and\r\nan element of growth.[23] The nation like the individual is the result\r\nof what has gone before. An heroic past, great men, glory that can\r\ncommand respect at home and abroad--that is the capital on which\r\nis based a national idea. To have wrought in common, to wish to\r\naccomplish more in the future, are essential conditions to be a\r\npeople. \"The existence of a nation is a plebiscite of every day, just\r\nas the existence of the individual is a perpetual affirmation of\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is evident, in summing up the salient features of this failure,\r\nthat a vital principle was not germinating in the inchoate mass.\r\nCharles himself never attained the rank of a national hero. More than\r\nthat, with all his individual states, he never had any nation, great\r\nor small, at his back. Personally he was a man without a country. His\r\nfather, Philip, was French, pure and simple, quite as French as his\r\ngrandfather, Philip the Hardy, the first Duke of Burgundy out of the\r\nHouse of Valois, even though Philip the Good had extended his sway\r\nto many non-French-speaking peoples and was able to use the Flemish\r\nspeech if it suited his whim. But that was as a condescension and as\r\nsomething extraneous. The chief of French peers remained his proudest\r\ntitle; his ability to influence French affairs, the task he liked\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nHis son was quite different in his attitude towards France. He\r\nminimised his degree of French blood royal. More than once he boasted\r\nof his kinship with Portuguese, with English stock. He had certain\r\ncharacteristics of an immigrant, who has abandoned family traditions\r\nand is proudly confident that his bequest to posterity is to outshine\r\nwhat he has inherited. Charles was not exactly a stupid man, but he\r\ncertainly was dazzled by his early surroundings into an overestimate\r\nof himself, into a conceit that was a tremendous stumbling-block in\r\nhis path. He had not the kind of intelligence that would have enabled\r\nhim to take at their worth the rhetorical phrases of adulation heaped\r\nupon him on festal occasions. Yet this same conceit, this very\r\nself-confidence, gave him a high conception of his duties. At his\r\naccession, he showed a sense of his responsibilities, a definite\r\ntheory of conduct which he fully intended to act upon. His very belief\r\nin his own powers gave him an intrinsic honesty of purpose. He was\r\nconvinced that he could maintain law, order, justice in his domain,\r\nand he fully intended to do so in a paternal way, but he left out of\r\nconsideration the rights of the people, rights older than his dynasty.\r\nIn his military career, too, at the outset, he evinced the strongest\r\nbent towards preserving the best conditions possible amid the\r\nbrutalities of warfare. He curbed the soldiers' passions, he protected\r\nwomen, and was as relentless towards miscreants in his ranks as\r\ntowards his foe. In civil matters he exerted himself to secure\r\nimpartial equity for all alike. When he gave a promise, he fully\r\nintended to make his words good. It was only in the face of repeated\r\ndeceptions of the cleverer and more unscrupulous Louis XI. that\r\nCharles changed for the worse. Exasperated by the knowledge that the\r\nking's solemn pledges were given repeatedly with no intention of\r\nfulfilment, he attempted to adopt a similar policy and was singularly\r\ninfelicitous in his imitation. His political methods degenerated into\r\nmere barefaced lying, softened by no graces, illumined by no clever\r\nintuition of where to draw the line. From 1472 on, the duke's word was\r\nworth no more than the king's, and words were assuredly at a discount\r\njust then. A perusal of the international correspondence of the period\r\nleaves the reader marvelling why time was wasted in covering paper,\r\nwith flimsy, insincere phrases, mendacious sign-posts which gave no\r\ntrue indication of the road to be travelled. There are, however,\r\ndifferences in the art of dissimulation and Charles never attained a\r\nmastery of the science.\r\n\r\nThe adjective which has attached itself to his name in English in an\r\ninaccurate rendering of _le téméraire_ which belongs to him in French.\r\nThere were other terms too applied to Charles at different periods of\r\nhis career. He was Charles the Hardy in his early youth, Charles the\r\nTerrible in those last months when he tried to fortify himself with\r\nwine unsuited to his constitution, but at all times he might have been\r\ncalled Charles the self-absorbed, Charles the solitary. There have\r\nbeen many men more passionate, more uncontrolled, than Charles of\r\nBurgundy, whose personal magnetism yet enabled them to win friends and\r\nto keep them, as the duke was powerless to do. The failure to command\r\npersonal devotion, unquestioning loyalty, was one of his chief\r\npersonal misfortunes. Philip, magnificent, lavish, debonair, found\r\nmany lenient apologists for his crimes, while his son received\r\ncriticism for his faults even from the faithful among his servitors.\r\nHow a reflection of his bearing glows out from the mirror turned\r\ncasually upon him by Commines' skilful hand! Take the glimpse of Louis\r\nXI. as he lures on St. Pol's messenger to imitate Charles. The Sire\r\nde Créville inspired by the royal interest in his narration about an\r\nincident at the court of Burgundy, puffs out his cheeks, stamps his\r\nfeet in a dictatorial manner, and swears by St. George as he quotes\r\nthe duke's words. Behind a screen are hidden Commines, and a\r\nBurgundian envoy aghast at hearing his liege lord so mocked. It is\r\na time when St. Pol is trying to ride three horses at once and\r\nthe French king takes this method to have Charles informed of his\r\nduplicity. \"Speak louder\" he says, \"I grow a little deaf,\" and the\r\nflattered envoy repeats his dramatic performance in a way to engrave\r\nit on the memory of the duke's retainer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOMB OF CHARLES OF BURGUNDY]\r\n\r\nIn thus touching on the traits of his former master, Commines does not\r\nshow malice or even a dislike for the duke. He is much more severe\r\nabout Louis--only he found the latter easier to serve.\r\n\r\nIn his family life, too, Charles does not seem to have found any\r\ncompanionship that affected his life. He is lauded as a faithful\r\nhusband to Isabella of Bourbon but her death seemed to make little\r\ndifference. Neither she nor Margaret of York had the actual\r\nsignificance enjoyed by Isabella of Portugal as consort to Philip the\r\nGood with his notoriously roving fancy.\r\n\r\nThus at home as well as abroad the last Duke of Burgundy tried to\r\nstand alone. Perhaps his chief happiness in life was that he never\r\nknew how insufficient for his desired task he was and how the new art\r\nof printing, the birth of Erasmus of Rotterdam, were the really great\r\nevents of his brief decade of sovereignty. It was his good fortune\r\nthat he never knew that no splendid achievement gave significance to\r\nhis device: \"I have undertaken it\"--_Je lay emprins_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mém. de la soc. bourg. de géog. et d' hist_.

(Gachard, _Études et notices\r\nhist,. des Pays-Bas_, i., I.)\r\n\r\nThis is a study of the report made by Gort Roelants, pensionary of\r\nBrussels, one of the deputies to the assembly of 1476. This so-called\r\n\"States-general\" was by no means a legislative assembly. When Philip\r\nthe Good convened deputies from the various states at Bruges in 1463,\r\nit was to save himself the trouble of going to the separate capitals\r\nto ask for _aides_. Assemblies of similar nature occurred several\r\ntimes before 1477, when Mary of Burgundy granted the privilege of\r\nself-convention and when a constitutional rôle was assured to the\r\nbody; though not used for many years (_See_ Pirenne, ii., 379.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Pour y penser la nuit jusques aw lendemain_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _S'ils n'avaient point charge limitée quantefois ils\r\ndevaient boire en chemin_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Compte-rendu par Antoine Rolin, Sr. d' Aymeries, Oct. 1,\r\n1475-Sept. 30, 1476.
