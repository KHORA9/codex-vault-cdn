EADS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nEARLY TRAINING\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan Eads was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, May 23, 1820.\r\nBoth the Eads family, who came from Maryland, and his mother's people,\r\nthe Buchanans, who were originally Irish, were gentlefolk; but James's\r\nfather never was very prosperous. The son, however, went to school, and\r\nhe showed early a very special love for machinery, observing with great\r\ninterest everything of that kind that he came upon. For a while the\r\nfamily lived in Cincinnati; from there they removed in 1829 to\r\nLouisville. In those days, when steamboats were the best of\r\nconveyances, the Ohio River formed a natural highway between the two\r\ntowns. On the trip the small boy of nine hung around the engine of the\r\nboat, considering it with so much wonder and admiration that finally\r\nthe engineer, who found him an apt pupil, explained the various parts\r\nof the mechanism to him.\r\n\r\nHe really had understood his lesson well, for two years later, in the\r\nlittle workshop that his father had fitted up for him, he made a small\r\nengine which ran by steam. Besides he made models of sawmills,\r\nfire-engines, steamboats, and electrotyping machines. Except such\r\nchance instruction as that which he found on the boat, he had had no\r\nteaching in mechanics, but worked with the ingenuity of many a bright\r\nboy; for he is by no means the only one who ever took apart and put\r\ntogether the family clock, or even a lever-watch, with no other tool\r\nthan a penknife. One of his inventions, which shows not so much his\r\ntalent as his true boyishness, was a small box-wagon, open only\r\nunderneath and with a hole in front, which, suddenly produced before\r\nhis mother and sisters, ran mysteriously across the room. The motive\r\npower concealed within this agreeable toy was found to be a live rat.\r\n\r\nSo much is often said of the precocity of youthful geniuses, that it is\r\ngood to know that young Eads was after all a real flesh-and-blood boy,\r\na boy so mischievous that, as he was the only son, his father hired a\r\nneighbor boy to come and play with him. Certainly he was very clever;\r\nbut that he had even better qualities than cleverness is shown by his\r\nfirst actions on his arrival at Saint Louis.\r\n\r\nHis father, deciding to move farther west, had sent ahead the mother,\r\nthe two daughters just grown, and the lad of thirteen, intending to\r\nfollow with supplies for opening a shop. Again the route was by river.\r\nArrived at Saint Louis, the boat caught fire; and early on a cold\r\nmorning the family set foot, scarcely clothed, not only in the city of\r\nwhich the young boy was to be one day the leading citizen, but on the\r\nvery spot, it is said, where he was afterwards to base one pier of his\r\ngreat bridge. On that bleak morning, however, none of them foresaw a\r\nbright future, or indeed anything but a distressful present. Some\r\nladies of the old French families of the town were very kind to the\r\nforlorn women; and once on her feet Mrs. Eads set about supporting\r\nherself and her children. In those days, when sometimes a letter took a\r\nweek to go a couple of hundred miles, she was not the one to wait for\r\nhelp from her husband; so she immediately rented a house and took\r\nboarders. The boy, as resourceful and self-reliant as his mother, now\r\nshowed his energy as well as his devotion by doing the first thing he\r\nfound to help her. In going along the street he saw some apples for\r\nsale, and, buying as many of them as he could afford, he peddled them\r\nto the passers-by.\r\n\r\nThat, of course, was no permanent occupation for a well-bred boy, whose\r\nassociations and abilities were both high. Nevertheless his family\r\ncould no longer afford to have him at school, and it was necessary for\r\nhim to do some sort of work. One of his mother's boarders, a Mr.\r\nBarrett Williams, offered him a position in his mercantile house.\r\nBefore long this gentleman discovered his young employee's aptitude and\r\noverwhelming love for mechanics, and kindly allowed the lad the use of\r\nhis own library. Studying at night the scientific books which he found\r\nthere, Eads acquired his first theoretical knowledge of engineering. In\r\nthis way, without teachers, he began, in a time when there was no free\r\nhigher education, to educate himself; and both then and ever after he\r\nwas a constant reader not only of scientific works, but of all kinds of\r\nbooks. This practical experience in helping to support his family and\r\nin getting his own education, while he was still so young a lad, was\r\nthe school in which he learned self-reliance. It is pleasant to know\r\nthat the earnestness of life did not take all of his boyishness away\r\nfrom him, for it must have been while he was hard at work that he built\r\na real steamboat, six feet long, and navigated it on Chouteau's Pond.\r\n\r\nFor five years he was a clerk in the dry-goods house. At the end of\r\nthat time, probably because he was in poor health, he left that\r\nposition for one that would take him more into the open air. Though his\r\nhealth was not strong, he was by no means an invalid; for at nineteen\r\nhis muscles were solid and his fund of nervous energy was\r\ninexhaustible. So, with the natural taste of a boy for a more exciting\r\nlife, he took a position as clerk on a Mississippi River steamboat.\r\nWhile he had nothing to do with actually running the boat, he certainly\r\nkept his eyes open to everything going on both on board and in the\r\nriver; and began then to make an acquaintance with the stream which was\r\nlater to be the scene of his greatest labors. If ever Nature played a\r\nprominent part in the life of a man, the Mississippi did in that of\r\nEads; for it became the opportunity for three of his chief works, and\r\nfrom it he learned perhaps more of the laws of science than from all\r\nthe books he ever read. To understand his life, one must have some idea\r\nof the huge river, which seems to flow sluggishly or rapidly through\r\nhis whole career.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi River, with its branches, drains the larger part of the\r\nwhole United States,--that is, from the Alleghanies on the east to the\r\nRockies on the west. The main stream, 4200 miles long, and in some\r\nplaces over a mile wide, flows along with tremendous force, ceaselessly\r\neating away its yellow clay banks. The water, full of sediment, is of a\r\nthick dull brown color. The clay that it washes off in the bends it\r\ndeposits on the juts of land, thus forming greater and greater curves;\r\nso that often the distance between two points is very much less by land\r\nthan by water. Sometimes there are only a few yards across the neck of\r\na peninsula, around which the channel distance is many miles; and on\r\none side the level of the river is several feet higher than on the\r\nother. Gradually the water keeps eating its way, until it forces a\r\npassage through the neck, and then the torrent rushes through in a\r\ncascade, with a roar that can be heard for miles. The banks dissolve\r\nlike sugar, and the next day steamboats can cross where the day before\r\nwere fields and may be houses. Besides this, the current is constantly\r\nwashing away and building up not only hidden bars on the river bottom,\r\nbut even islands above its surface. In the fall and in the spring it\r\nrises with such terrifying rapidity that some years it quickly\r\noverflows its banks in certain reaches till it is sixty miles wide.\r\nHouses and trees torn from their places, and wrecks of boats, float or\r\nprotrude from the bottom of this brown lake. And when the flood\r\nsubsides, the current often chooses a new and changed channel. Amid the\r\never-varying dangers of such a river the only safety for steamboats is\r\nin a race of pilots so learned and so alert as to have the shifting\r\nbars and courses always in their minds. In 1839, when steamboats were\r\nthe only means of rapid transit in the West, when there were more of\r\nthem in the harbor of the little town of Saint Louis than to-day when\r\nit is a great city, this class of pilots was a large and a very\r\nrespectable one. Much of their knowledge of the river was what young\r\nEads learned while he was a clerk among them; and as time went on, he\r\ncame to realize that although the Mississippi seems so capricious in\r\nits terrible games that one would think them the result of chance, yet\r\nin truth, they \"are controlled by laws as immutable as the Creator.\"\r\n\r\nDespite all care that could be used, steamboats were every week sunk\r\nand wrecked, and with their valuable engines, boilers, and cargoes were\r\noften left where they lay in the ceaseless brown current. After he had\r\nbeen for three years on the river, Eads gave up his clerkship to go\r\ninto the business of raising these boats, their machinery, and their\r\nfreight. In 1842, at the age of twenty-two, he formed a partnership\r\nwith Case & Nelson, boat-builders. His first appearance in the new\r\nbusiness was an experience that well shows his quick inventive genius,\r\nhis persistency, and his courage. While his diving-bell boat was\r\nbuilding, a barge loaded with pig-lead sank in the rapids at Keokuk,\r\n212 miles from Saint Louis. A contract having been made with its\r\nowners, Eads hurried up there to rescue the freight from fifteen feet\r\nof water. He had no knowledge himself of diving-armor; but he had\r\nengaged a skilled diver from the Great Lakes, who brought his own\r\napparatus. They set out in a barge and anchored over the wreck; but,\r\nonce there, they soon discovered that the current was so exceedingly\r\nrapid that the diver could do nothing in it. Eads at once returned to\r\nKeokuk, and, buying a forty-gallon whiskey hogshead, took it out to the\r\nwreck; and having knocked out one head, he slung pigs of lead round his\r\nimprovised diving-bell, made a seat inside it, rigged it to his derrick\r\nand air-pumps, and then asked the diver to go down in it. The diver\r\nhaving very naturally refused, Eads on the spot set himself a precedent\r\nwhich, during his after life, he never broke,--saying that he would not\r\nask an employee to go where he would not trust himself, he got inside\r\nhis hogshead and was lowered into the river. His assistants were unused\r\nto managing diving-bells, and when they came to haul him up the derrick\r\ngot out of order. By main force they were able to raise the hogshead to\r\nthe surface, but not above it. As the air-pump continued to work all\r\nthe while, Eads, though wondering what was amiss, sat patiently in his\r\nplace, till finally he saw a hand appear under the rim of the hogshead.\r\nSeizing this, he ducked under and got out. Although the rough\r\ndiving-bell worked thus awkwardly at first, it served well enough, and\r\nfinally all of the lost freight was saved.\r\n\r\nA young man so fearless, so energetic, and so able to invent mechanical\r\ndevices at sudden need, was bound to succeed in a business like this.\r\nAnd young Eads did succeed. \"Fortune,\" he believed, \"favors the brave;\"\r\nand his motto was, \"Drive on!\"\r\n\r\nThe insurance companies were willing to give the wreckers a large\r\ninterest, sometimes as much as a half, of the rescued cargoes; and\r\nthere was a law by which a vessel or freight that had been wrecked for\r\nfive years belonged to whoever could get it up. Eads and his partners\r\nworked up and down the river for hundreds of miles. The first\r\ndiving-bell boat was followed by a larger one, provided with machinery\r\nfor pumping out sand, and for raising whole hulls. While in this\r\nhazardous business Eads invented many new appliances for use in its\r\nvarious branches. Because he was in charge of a boat people began to\r\ncall the young wrecker Captain Eads, and that was the only reason for a\r\ntitle which clung to him always. He grew now to know the river as few\r\nhave ever known it,--his operations extended from Galena, Illinois, to\r\nthe Balize at the river's very mouth, and even into the tributaries of\r\nthe Mississippi,--and he used to say that there was not a stretch of\r\nfifty miles in the twelve hundred between Saint Louis and New Orleans\r\nin which he had not stood on the bottom under his diving-bell.\r\n\r\nWith the same devotion to his parents as when he peddled the apples in\r\nthe street, Eads now bought them a farm in Iowa, and provided in every\r\nway he could for their comfort. But beyond the ordinary desire of\r\nmaking a fortune for them, for himself, and for a new interest that was\r\ncoming into his life, it does not appear that there were in his mind\r\nany unusual ambitions, any of the dreams of genius. As yet he was only\r\na hard-working, earnest young man, extraordinarily clever to be sure,\r\nbut founding on that cleverness no visions of great renown in the\r\nfuture. Perhaps this was because he had enough to dream of in the\r\npresent, enough hopes of purely domestic happiness to look towards. For\r\nhe had fallen in love with a Miss Martha Dillon, a young lady of about\r\nhis own age, daughter of a rich man in Saint Louis. The father\r\ndisapproved of the match, not only because he thought the suitor too\r\nyoung, too poor, too unknown, but because he wished to keep his\r\ndaughter with him, and for other less reasonable causes.\r\n\r\nThe letters between the engaged couple show Eads at twenty-five as a\r\nkeen, experienced, and yet an unsophisticated young man; generous,\r\nproud, brave, and courteous; a lover of Nature, of poetry, of people,\r\nand of good books; an inveterate early riser; reverend in religion, and\r\nyet, while nominally a Catholic, really a free-thinker; sentimental in\r\nhis feelings almost as if he had lived a century sooner, and at the\r\nsame time controlling his true and deep emotions, and showing his\r\nstrong love only to those he loved.\r\n\r\nAt last Eads and Miss Dillon were married, he being over twenty-five at\r\nthe time, she nearly twenty-four. Eads then sold out his wrecking\r\nbusiness and left the river. He probably made this change because he\r\nhoped thereby not only to be more with his wife, but also to support\r\nher in the comfort she had been used to, and to show her father that he\r\ncould do so. The new enterprise, into which at least one of his old\r\npartners entered with him, and into which he put all his money, was the\r\nmanufacture of glass; and they built the first glass factory west of\r\nthe Ohio River. He had to go to Pittsburg--then a long journey by boat,\r\nstage, and rail--to get trained workmen and to learn the process\r\nhimself. Almost all of the necessary ingredients and apparatus had to\r\nbe sent for to Pittsburg, to Cleveland, or to New York; and they were\r\noften slow in arriving and thereby made matters drag considerably.\r\nStill there was always something to do, and Eads, the only one of the\r\npartners who understood the trade, was forced to work extraordinarily\r\nhard. With his usual persistence he stuck to it pluckily, often staying\r\nup late into the night and rising the next day before dawn to oversee\r\noperations. He was also indispensable for his faculty of managing men;\r\nand a letter to his wife written on his twenty-seventh birthday (1847)\r\nshows how strong the man already was in that power of getting the most\r\nfrom a workman, which was afterwards to count for so much in his best\r\nwork. An employer, he says, must \"have constant control of his temper,\r\nand be able to speak pleasantly to one man the next moment after having\r\nspoken in the harshest manner to another, and even to give the same man\r\na pleasant reply a few minutes after having corrected him. Self must be\r\nleft out of the matter entirely, and a man or boy spoken to only as\r\nconcerns his conduct; and the authority which the controller has over\r\nthe controlled, used only when absolutely necessary, and then with the\r\nutmost promptness.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, despite all his firmness and perseverance, the difficulties of\r\nthe glassworks became greater and greater; and at last, after having\r\nbeen run two years, they were shut down. Eads was left with debts of\r\n$25,000. The very unusual action of his creditors in this crisis shows\r\nwhat confidence they had in his integrity and in his ability; for they\r\nadvanced him $1500 with which to go back into the wrecking business,\r\nand he at once rejoined his former partners. He now worked harder, if\r\npossible, than ever; for he felt, as he wrote to his wife, that \"with a\r\nman in debt it cannot be said that his time is his own.\" Powerful as he\r\nwas physically, his health was not good, but even in sickness he\r\nscarcely ceased to toil during the first year or two; and at the end of\r\nten years, not only had all his debts been long since paid, but his\r\nfirm was worth half a million dollars.\r\n\r\nWork, however, was to him only a means to an end. The real dignity of\r\ncharacter he knew to lie in culture. To a small boy he sends, in one of\r\nhis letters, the message that he should \"be a good boy and study hard,\r\nas that is the only way to be respected when he is grown.\" Even in his\r\namusements his mind sought occupation: we find him at night on the\r\ndiving-bell boat playing chess, and in later years he had become\r\nunusually adept at that game.\r\n\r\nThe wrecking business was full of life and action. Here and there, up\r\nand down the river, and into its branches, wherever a boat was wrecked\r\nor burned or run aground, the Submarine hurried off to reach the spot\r\nbefore other wreckers. Under their bell the divers got at the engines,\r\nboilers, and freight, while the pumps, worked from above, cleared away\r\nthe sand; and sometimes by means of great chains and derricks the very\r\nhull itself would be lifted and towed ashore. But on that huge river,\r\nwhich at times would suddenly rise three feet in a single night, and\r\nwhose strong current played such giant pranks as turning over a wreck\r\nin the chains that were raising it, there was need of eternal vigilance\r\nand agility. However, Eads was more on his own ground on the river than\r\non the shore, and his business so increased that he was soon running\r\nfour diving-bell boats. In 1849 twenty-nine boats were burned at the\r\nlevee in Saint Louis in one big fire, and most of their remains were\r\nremoved by him. Winter as well as summer the work went on; and the task\r\nof cutting out a vessel wrecked in an ice-gorge, or of raising one from\r\nbeneath the ice, must have been as trying as walking the river bottom\r\nin search of a wreck. Eads himself, years later, thus describes one of\r\nhis many experiences: \"Five miles below Cairo, I searched the river\r\nbottom for the wreck of the Neptune, for more than sixty days, and in a\r\ndistance of three miles. My boat was held by a long anchor line, and\r\nwas swung from side to side of the channel, over a distance of 500\r\nfeet, by side anchor lines, while I walked on the river bottom under\r\nthe bell across the channel. The boat was then dropped twenty feet\r\nfarther down stream, and I then walked back again as she was hauled\r\ntowards the other shore. In this way I walked on the bottom four hours\r\nat least, every day (Sundays excepted) during that time.\" For a day's\r\nwork the city of Saint Louis gave him $80, out of which he paid his own\r\nworkmen. He was so prosperous that, as he wrote to his wife, there was\r\nno need for him to join the rush to California to get gold; and his\r\nsuccess caused much envy among his rivals. He began to clear the\r\nchannel of the Mississippi from some of its obstructions and to improve\r\nthe harbor of Saint Louis.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 he knew his work so well that he went to Washington and\r\nproposed to Congress to remove all the snags and wrecks from the\r\nWestern rivers,--the Mississippi, the Missouri, the Arkansas, and the\r\nOhio,--and to keep their channels open for a term of years. A bill to\r\nthat purpose passed the House, but in the Senate it was defeated by\r\nJefferson Davis and others. The next year, on account of poor health,\r\nEads retired from business, but he carried with him a fortune. He had\r\nnot succeeded in his purpose at Washington, but his name was known\r\nthere and remembered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his wife had died, and two years later he had married the\r\nwidow of a first cousin. With his second wife he made his first trip to\r\nEurope,--the first of very many he was destined to make. In 1857, being\r\nthirty-seven years old, he retired, as I have said, from business.\r\n\r\nHis youthful hopes, the ordinary ambitions of men, were realized. He\r\nhad been a poor boy: at only thirty-seven he was rich,--very rich for\r\nthe times and for the place. From his proposals to the government, we\r\nmay imagine that he now had broader dreams of usefulness. But his first\r\nproposition toward river improvement had been checked. He had bought a\r\nlarge house and grounds. He made for himself a rose-arbor, and for four\r\nyears he was as much unoccupied as his lively mind permitted. He was at\r\nany rate what is called a man of leisure.\r\n\r\nThen, four years being passed, he received from Washington, from his\r\nfriend Attorney-General Bates, a letter written three days after the\r\nsurrender of Fort Sumter, which said: \"Be not surprised if you are\r\ncalled here suddenly by telegram. If called, come instantly. In a\r\ncertain contingency it will be necessary to have the aid of the most\r\nthorough knowledge of our Western rivers, and the use of steam on them,\r\nand in that event I advised that you should be consulted.\"\r\n\r\nThe government was thinking of placing gunboats to occupy and to defend\r\nthe Western waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE GUNBOATS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Civil War the State of Missouri and the city of\r\nSaint Louis were in a very confused condition. A border slave State,\r\nMissouri contained a great many persons of Southern birth and Southern\r\nsympathies; and besides a good many strong Northern men, Saint Louis\r\nhad also a considerable German population, all stanch Unionists. But\r\nexcepting the Germans and one or two dauntless clear-seeing men, who\r\nread the future, few persons in either party wished to fight if\r\nfighting could possibly be avoided. The governor, a Southern man, while\r\nhesitating at actual secession, wished and tried to control the power\r\nof the State so that at need it might help the South; and while\r\nprofessing loyalty, he did all he could to prove his disloyalty to the\r\nUnion. The legislature, however, would not pass a bill to arm the\r\nState, thereby, says an historian, causing the South to sustain \"a\r\ndefeat more disastrous to its independence than any which thereafter\r\nbefell its arms, down to the fall of Vicksburg.\" In response to\r\nLincoln's call for troops, the governor refused to send any from\r\nMissouri. An extraordinary state convention, called in this crisis,\r\nvoted against secession. Seeing that the governor, notwithstanding\r\nthis, was covertly aiming at throwing himself and the State, so far as\r\nhe could, in with the Confederacy, young Frank Blair and General\r\nNathaniel Lyon, carrying things with a high hand, seized and dispersed\r\nthe state militia encamped in Saint Louis, got control of almost all\r\nthe Federal arms in the State, and with outside aid and help from the\r\nregular army, chased the governor from the capital, and held him at bay\r\nlong enough for the convention to depose him and the General Assembly,\r\nand to establish a state government loyal to the Union.\r\n\r\nDuring all these lively events Saint Louis was in confusion. There were\r\nmany minds in the town--secessionists, conditional and unconditional\r\nunionists, submissionists: some who wanted war, some who wanted only to\r\npreserve peace so that they might keep their homes and fortunes safe,\r\neven on condition of abandoning slavery.\r\n\r\nJames B. Eads did not own a slave, nor did he approve of slavery, but\r\namong his friends and associates there were many who did own them, and\r\nmany secessionists. It is curious to observe how little a difference of\r\nopinion on these points, that had become so vital, was able to put\r\npersonal enmity among men who were true friends. Of course, among mere\r\nacquaintances there were many instances of bitterness and taunting.\r\nThrough it all, Eads, with his rare tact and his exquisite manners,\r\nsteered without collision, offending none of those who were not on his\r\nside. And yet we are presently to see what a deep interest his side had\r\nfor him, and how much he was able and willing to do for it.\r\n\r\nBetween the election and the inauguration of Lincoln, Eads and three\r\nother prominent citizens of Saint Louis wrote a letter to him,\r\nexpressing their fears that an attempt at secession would be made, and\r\nurging the policy of having a secretary of state from one of the slave\r\nStates. And they recommended, for \"purity of character, stern\r\nintegrity, exalted patriotism, and enlightened statesmanship,\" Edward\r\nBates, born in Virginia, married into a South Carolina family, and long\r\nresident in Missouri. A first draught of this letter is in Eads's\r\nhandwriting. When the new cabinet was formed, Bates, a personal friend\r\nof Lincoln's as well as of Eads's, was given a position in it, that of\r\nattorney-general. It was he who, three days after Sumter was fired on,\r\nwrote the letter, already quoted, telling Eads to expect a telegram\r\ncalling him to Washington for consultation on the best method of\r\ndefending and occupying the Western rivers. Eads himself was by this\r\ntime no believer in a defensive policy for the government. After Sumter\r\nhe had already written to Bates advocating determined and vigorous\r\nmeasures. So, when the telegram soon followed the letter, he was glad\r\nto hasten to Washington in order to be of use. There he was introduced\r\nto the Secretary and to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe importance of controlling the Mississippi River was well seen by\r\nthe great strategist, Lincoln, who called it \"the backbone of the\r\nrebellion\"--\"the key to the whole situation.\" If it could be held by\r\nthe government, the Confederacy could neither move its troops up and\r\ndown it, nor--thus cut in half--could it bring over from Texas and\r\nArkansas the many men and the quantities of food greatly needed by its\r\narmies east of the river. Realizing this, the Confederacy was already\r\nbeginning to fortify the Mississippi and the Ohio with its branches. To\r\ndislodge the rebels Bates proposed a fleet of gunboats. The Secretary\r\nof War, however, thinking this idea of gunboats either useless or\r\nimpracticable, showed at first no interest in the plan. But at the\r\nrequest of the Secretary of the Navy, who realized the importance of\r\nthe subject, Eads prepared a statement of his views, embodying Bates's\r\nproject. In it he also suggested, besides the best kind of boats for\r\nthe service, batteries, to be erected at several points. Commodore\r\nPaulding, on reading this statement, at once reported in favor of it.\r\nSuddenly, the Secretary of War, when he saw that the scheme was coming\r\nto something, claimed jurisdiction over the whole matter, but finally\r\nhe agreed to order the same officer already appointed for the purpose\r\nby the Navy to go west with Eads and purchase vessels to be armed. All\r\nnecessary approvals having been made, the two went to Cairo, where they\r\nexamined the Benton, one of the former snag-boat fleet. Afterwards Eads\r\nproposed the strong and swift Missouri River steamboats. But neither of\r\nthese suited his colleague, who at last went to Cincinnati, and buying\r\nthree boats there, armed them himself: and very useful boats they were.\r\n\r\nThe gunboat scheme had been first proposed in April; it was now June,\r\nand excepting these three wooden boats, nothing seemed to have come of\r\nit. So in July the quartermaster-general advertised for bids for\r\nironclad gunboats. In 1861 ironclads were a rather new thing. France\r\nand England had a few of them, but at the time the Merrimac was begun\r\nno ironclad had been finished in America. On August 5, when the bids\r\nwere opened, that of Eads was found not only to be the lowest, but to\r\npromise the quickest work. On August 7 the contract was signed for\r\nseven gunboats to be delivered at Cairo on October 10,--sixty-four days\r\nlater. This contract, it has been said, would under ordinary\r\ncircumstances have been thought by most men impossible to fulfill. And\r\nthe circumstances then were anything but ordinary: it was a time of\r\ngreat financial distress; in the border slave States the pursuits of\r\npeace were interrupted; all was in turmoil and confusion;\r\nrolling-mills, machine-shops, foundries, forges, and sawmills were all\r\nidle, and many of the mechanics had gone to the war. The timber for the\r\nboats was still growing in the forests; the iron was not yet\r\nmanufactured. And so short was the time that two or three factories\r\nalone, no matter how well equipped they might be, were not to be\r\ndepended upon. Yet Eads had undertaken to start up the factories, to\r\ngather the materials, and to build his boats in two months. Never were\r\nthe self-reliance and the energy of the man better exhibited; but his\r\nkeen business sense might have hesitated, had not his patriotism shown\r\nhim that the Union needed the boats quickly.\r\n\r\nMost of the machine-shops and foundries of Saint Louis were at once set\r\nto work night and day; and for hours at a time the telegraph wires to\r\nPittsburg and to Cincinnati were in use. Twenty-one steam-engines and\r\nthirty-five boilers were needed. Prepared timber was brought from eight\r\ndifferent States, and the first iron plating used in the war was rolled\r\nnot only in Saint Louis and Cincinnati, but in small towns in Ohio and\r\nKentucky. Within two weeks 4000 men were at work in places miles\r\napart,--working by night and seven days a week. To the workmen on the\r\nhulls who should stick to the task till it was done Eads promised a\r\n\"handsome bonus;\" and in this way gratuitously paid out thousands of\r\ndollars. The building of this little fleet has been called \"a triumph\r\nof sagacity, pluck, and executive ability unsurpassed by any exploit in\r\nthe military or civil history of the times.\"\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the seven boats were not finished at the time called for.\r\nThat they were all launched within a hundred days of the signing of the\r\ncontract is amazing enough, but if they had been built after designs of\r\nEads's own, so that he would not have been delayed by sudden changes\r\nnecessitated when he found weaknesses in the plans furnished him, or\r\nwhen the designer changed the specifications, and if the government,\r\nharassed and driven as it then was, had been able to pay him according\r\nto its part of the contract, there is little doubt that he would have\r\nhad the vessels finished in time according to his agreement. Even as it\r\nwas, it was legally decided later that he was not at fault. When he\r\nentered into the contract he was a rich man; and as he was not to\r\nreceive his first payment from the government for twenty days, probably\r\nonly a rich man could have had the credit necessary to put so much\r\nmachinery into motion. As it proved subsequently, the government was so\r\nlax in its payment, and demanded work so much more expensive than the\r\nspecifications called for, that before the work was finished Eads was\r\nin a hard way financially. He had been much worried and distracted in\r\nobtaining funds: after exhausting his own fortune he had sought the aid\r\nof patriotic friends, and it was principally in order to pay them back\r\nthat he made his appeal to the government. By the terms of his contract\r\nhe might have delayed the work until his payments were received, and\r\nmight thus have saved himself great distress and worry, but, as I have\r\nsaid, he realized how much the Union needed the boats. He himself said\r\nthat it was \"of the utmost importance that these boats should be made\r\nas effective as possible, without reference to how I was to be affected\r\nby delays, ... and that their completion should be pushed with the\r\nutmost energy, whether the government failed in its part of the bargain\r\nor not.\" Their rapid completion then was a proof not only of Eads's\r\nmasterful energy, but of his self-sacrificing patriotism as well.\r\nUltimately he was paid most of the money for the gunboats, and as a\r\nresult of his patriotism won back the fortune he had risked; but at the\r\ntime of course it hampered him intolerably to be without funds. He had,\r\nbesides, other difficulties to contend with. At least one of his\r\nsub-contractors or head-workmen was a disappointed bidder for the\r\ngunboat contract, and was on a salary which ran till the boats were\r\nfinished; and while Eads would not mention such a suspicion in public,\r\nhe suggested in a private letter that this had been an additional cause\r\nof delay.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the seven boats had been launched and were ready to be put\r\ninto commission by Flag-Officer Foote, before he had more than one\r\nthird of the necessary crews ready for them.\r\n\r\nThese seven, the Saint Louis (afterwards De Kalb), the Cairo,\r\nCarondelet, Cincinnati, Louisville, Mound City, and Pittsburg, were all\r\nalike. The Saint Louis, as Eads wrote to Lincoln, when he sent him a\r\nphotograph of her, \"was the first ironclad built in America.... She was\r\nthe first armored vessel against which the _fire of a hostile battery_\r\nwas directed on this continent; and, so far as I can ascertain, she was\r\nthe first ironclad that ever _engaged a naval force_ in the world.\" In\r\nreading the descriptions of them, and in reading in the naval histories\r\nof their undeniable faults, it must be remembered that Eads \"had no\r\npart in the modeling of these boats, and is therefore relieved of all\r\nresponsibility as to their imperfections.\" They were 175 feet long,\r\n51-1/2 feet beam. Their flat sides sloped upward and inward at an angle\r\nof about 35°, and the front and rear casemates corresponded with the\r\nsides, the stern-wheel being entirely covered by the rear casemate. It\r\nwas a large paddle-wheel, placed forward of the stern so as to be\r\nprotected. The whole thing was like a tremendous uncovered box, with\r\nits sides sloping up and in, and containing the battery, the machinery,\r\nand the paddle-wheel, while the smoke-stacks and the conical\r\npilot-house stuck up out of the top. Captain Mahan says that they\r\nlooked like gigantic turtles. Underneath the water, they were simply\r\nlike flat-bottomed scows. As they were intended always to fight bows\r\non, they were built with that in view. In front they were accordingly\r\narmored two and a half inches over two feet of solid oak. The only\r\nother armor they carried was abreast of the boiler and engines. The\r\nstern, therefore, and the greater part of the sides were decidedly\r\nvulnerable. Their armament consisted of three guns forward, four on\r\neach broadside, and two at the stern.\r\n\r\nWhen Eads was given a chance to alter a boat from his own designs, he\r\nmade it a much better one than these. It was a boat ordered by General\r\nFremont in September, 1861, in excess of the government appropriation\r\nfor the river fleet. This was the same snag-boat which three months\r\nbefore had been suggested for alteration by Eads, and refused by the\r\narmy's agent. In this case, as in so many afterwards when Eads knew\r\nhimself to be right, he stuck persistently to his own opinion; and out\r\nof the heavy old boat, despised and objected to by so many persons, he\r\nfashioned the \"old war-horse,\" the Benton, which, slow as she was,\r\nSpears, the naval historian, calls the most powerful warship afloat at\r\nthat date. As a snag-boat, formerly used by Eads, she had \"had two\r\nhulls so joined and strengthened that she could get the largest kind of\r\na cottonwood tree between them, hoist it out of the mud, and drag it\r\nclear of the channel.\" These hulls were now joined together; and while\r\nthe boat was armored on the same general plan as the seven contract\r\ngunboats, she was so much more completely iron clad as to avoid the\r\ndanger that they were exposed to of having their boilers burst and\r\ngreat damage and death caused thereby. Her tonnage was twice that of\r\nthe others; her size about 200 by 75 feet. She was entirely iron clad.\r\nIn her gun-deck casemate the twenty inches of timber under the plating\r\nhad \"its grain running up from the water instead of horizontally, by\r\nwhich means [wrote Eads] a ball will strike, as it were, _with\r\nthe_ grain, and then be more readily deflected. On the same principle\r\nthat a minie ball will penetrate five inches of oak, crossing the\r\ngrain, while it will not enter one inch if fired at the end of the\r\ntimber.\" This detail illustrates the care and interest with which Eads\r\nbuilt his boats.\r\n\r\nThe eight of them, Captain Mahan says, \"formed the backbone of the\r\nriver fleet throughout the war,\" and \"may be fairly called the ships of\r\nthe line of battle on the Western waters.\" He speaks also of their\r\n\"very important services.\" This is milder praise than has been given\r\nthem. Commander Stembel said that he had heard them called equal to\r\n5000 men each; Boynton, the naval historian, goes so far as to say that\r\nthe permanent occupation of the South was rendered possible by the\r\nironclad navy of the Western waters. Though the naval battles in the\r\nAtlantic were perhaps more brilliant, he says, none, unless that\r\nbetween the Merrimac and the Monitor, had more important results. Eads\r\nhas been called as potent as a great general in clearing the upper\r\nMississippi. He did not, to be sure, build the entire gunboat fleet,\r\nbut he did build, as Captain Mahan says, the backbone of it; and that\r\nthe praises for that fleet, which I have quoted, are not altogether\r\nextravagant, is further shown by the comments of Mr. John Fiske. He\r\nsays, \"While it was seldom that they [\"these formidable gunboats\"]\r\ncould capture fortified places without the aid of a land force, at the\r\nsame time this combination of strength with speed made them an\r\nauxiliary without which the greater operations of the war could hardly\r\nhave been undertaken.\"\r\n\r\nThese eight boats figured in many a fight on the great river and its\r\nbranches. They \"were ever where danger was.\" A month and more before\r\nthe Merrimac and the Monitor were finished, the important capture of\r\nFort Henry \"was a victory exclusively for the gunboats.\" It was the\r\nCarondelet that ran the gauntlet past Island Number 10, a feat as full\r\nof romance and daring as any that the Civil War tells us of. And these\r\nthings were done with vessels still unpaid for and the personal\r\nproperty of their builder. Their usefulness was a great satisfaction to\r\nEads, and he rejoiced, as he wrote to Foote, with \"the prideful\r\npleasure of the poor armorer who forged the sword that in gallant hands\r\nstruck down the foe.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Benton left her dock for Cairo, Foote requested Eads to see\r\nher there in safety. Eads, who was so deeply interested in his boats\r\nthat on another occasion he was narrowly prevented from going into\r\naction with one of them, gladly agreed. Before long the Benton\r\ngrounded. As Eads was merely a guest, and as there were naval officers\r\naboard, he did not feel called upon to interfere with any suggestions.\r\nBut after the officers and crew had labored all night trying to float\r\nher, then with his aptitude for emergencies he used his scientific\r\nknowledge to suggest another scheme. The captain at once gave him leave\r\nto command the entire crew, and by means of hawsers tied to trees\r\nashore and then strongly tightened, the vessel was floated. In this\r\ncase the old river man knew more than the naval officers.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1862, the Navy Department called Eads to Washington to make\r\ndesigns for more ironclads,--or rather boats made wholly of iron. These\r\nwere to be of very light draught and turreted. He submitted plans for\r\nboats drawing five feet. The department insisted on lighter draught,\r\nbut still on heavy plating. So he revised his designs once, and then\r\nonce more. Finally the draught was reduced to only three and a half\r\nfeet. Eads has himself described his going back to his room in the\r\nhotel, and in a few hours making over his designs. When these boats\r\nwere finished they were found to draw even less than had been\r\ncontracted for, so that extra armor was ordered for them, and three of\r\nthem exceeded the contract speed. At first two boats were ordered,\r\nlater four others. For the turrets Eads submitted designs of his own,\r\nbut as it was then only a month after the Monitor's fight, Ericsson's\r\nturrets were insisted on for the first two boats, although\r\nmodifications were allowed. As the other four had two turrets each,\r\nEads was allowed on two of them to try one turret of his own, with the\r\nguns worked by steam, on condition of replacing them at his own cost\r\nwith Ericsson's in case of failure. This was the first manipulation of\r\nheavy artillery by steam. The guns were fired every forty-five seconds,\r\nor seven times as fast as in Ericsson's turrets.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fourteen gunboats, Eads also converted seven\r\ntransports into musket-proof \"tinclads,\" and built four mortarboats.\r\n\"Such men,\" says Boynton, \"deserve a place in history by the side of\r\nthose who fought our battles.\"\r\n\r\nThe career of some of the gunboats subsequent to the war is\r\ninteresting. In 1880 the Chickasaw and the Winnebago, which were two of\r\nthe six iron boats, and both of which took part in the naval campaign\r\nat Mobile, had come into the hands of Peru; and old as they were, they\r\nwere used very effectively against some of the larger and more modern\r\nboats of the Chileans.\r\n\r\nDuring those trying war times all of Eads's tremendous energy had by no\r\nmeans been exhausted by the gunboats. In more ways than one he had been\r\nshowing himself a good citizen and a kind-hearted man. Much as his\r\nfortune had been drained by the boats, he still found money to give to\r\nthe sufferers in the war. Out of a belated partial payment on the\r\nBenton he at once sent money to Foote for use in relief work, and with\r\ncharacteristic persistence he sent several letters and telegrams to\r\nmake sure of the money's arriving. A month or so later he sent a check\r\nfrom Washington to Saint Louis to the Sanitary Commission, asking that\r\nits receipt might not be made public. In the letter sent with this he\r\nspeaks of the war as \"an accursed contest between brothers,\" but adds\r\nthat the \"cause is most worthy of the sacrifice.\" From the niece of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy we also find a letter of acknowledgment of money\r\nto be used in relief. But it was not only to the soldiers that he\r\nshowed his tenderness: to Foote, the gallant \"Christian commander\" of\r\nhis fleet, he sent various friendly gifts when that brave man lay\r\ndying,--grapes from his own vines, a portrait he had had painted of his\r\nfriend. And even to those on the other side he showed an unusual\r\nconsideration. Towards the end of the war there seemed to be no means\r\nof feeding the many refugees in Saint Louis but by levying a tax upon\r\nSouthern sympathizers. Eads, who foresaw what bitterness such a course\r\nwould produce, offered, in the name of a bank in which he was a\r\ndirector, $1000 to start a subscription to be used instead, and the\r\ninvidious assessment was never levied again.\r\n\r\nTo his personal friends he was always generous and thoughtful, sending\r\nthem many presents, defending them from misrepresentation, and helping\r\nthem in their chosen careers. By means of his influence and tact he\r\nprocured the release of an indiscreet person who had talked himself\r\ninto McDowell's College prison as a suspected enemy to the government.\r\nGiving to others seemed a trait in Eads's character which afforded him\r\nan intense pleasure; and though a man of great dignity, he used with\r\nhis intimate friends a charming playfulness and affection. He could be\r\nextremely mild in correcting faults; and while he was inclined to bear\r\nwith others, he could be stern. His manners were rather those one\r\nexpects in a European gentleman of leisure and high breeding, than in a\r\nformer steamboat clerk and a man who had worked hard most of his life.\r\nHis hospitality was princely. In his large house in the suburbs of\r\nSaint Louis he received not only the young friends of his five\r\ndaughters and his own friends, but also officers of the river fleet and\r\nof the army, officers sent west on inspection duty, and foreign\r\nofficers following the course of the war and of the improvements in\r\ngunboat building.\r\n\r\nHis mind was as active as his heart was generous, and the course of his\r\nlife mirrored that activity. Now he was at home, now in Washington, now\r\nat Cairo visiting the gunboats to see how they worked under fire. In\r\nWashington he was busy with plans and projects. An intimate associate\r\nsaid of him in his later life that he was always inventing some new gun\r\nor gun-carriage; and we may be sure that if he ever was doing so, he\r\nwas in those war times. Besides inventing his own, he was also busy\r\nexamining Ericsson's inventions, in making improvements on them, in\r\napplying steam in novel ways to the working of artillery and to the\r\nrotating and raising of turrets; in sending models of his inventions\r\nhere and there, at home and abroad, to Germany, where the Prussian\r\nminister, a friend with whom he often dined, \"wished they could get\r\nsome of his boats on the Rhine;\" having his turrets explained at a\r\nRussian dinner in New York or Washington; and receiving from the Navy\r\nDepartment an appointment as special agent to visit the navy yards in\r\nEurope. At home he was just as busy. With his house so full of company,\r\nhe nevertheless found time somewhere for solid reading apart from his\r\nwork--the Attorney-General sent him Cicero's letters, and he lent the\r\nAttorney-General King Alfred's works. There is a curious interest in\r\nknowing what two men so engrossed, and upon such necessary duties, were\r\nreading at such a time. While he was building the second batch of\r\ngunboats, he wrote to Bates in a personal letter that he believed he\r\nhad the most complete and convenient works in the country for iron\r\nboat-building; that there and in other places he had as many as seventy\r\nblacksmith fires at work for him, and that his men were all sheltered\r\nfrom sun and rain. After those boats were finished, he went on planning\r\nothers, and we have a letter from Farragut in which the admiral asks if\r\nsome of them are not for his use at Mobile.\r\n\r\nEads, by this period in his strenuous life, knew a great many men, all\r\nof whom he treated with a uniform dignity and courtesy, even when they\r\nwere unfriendly, and a few of whom he was on the most intimate terms\r\nwith. Among all of them he was admired; perhaps already he was as\r\nprominent a citizen as there was in Saint Louis, and as it was still in\r\nthe good old times when the mayoralty there was a high honor to the\r\nbest men, it was suggested to him that he hold the office. Nor was this\r\nthe first honor offered to be thrust upon him; early in the war Bates\r\nhad wanted him appointed commissary of subsistence at Saint Louis, and\r\nthough it was unusual to appoint a civilian to that position, Lincoln\r\nhad been willing to do it to oblige Bates,--but Eads had not wished it.\r\nMore than a year later he was given a commission of lieutenant-colonel\r\nby the governor, but he was never sworn in. Like all men in those\r\ntroublous times, he took a peculiar interest in politics; and on being\r\nasked privately in a joint letter from the editors of three Saint Louis\r\npapers (two of them German) exactly what his politics were, he replied\r\nthat he was as strongly in favor of emancipation as he was opposed to\r\nslavery, and that he believed in no \"kid-glove policy;\" but he remarked\r\nincidentally that if he were to be offered the mayoralty he should\r\nrefuse it.\r\n\r\nHis work was for the whole country. While he was still too much\r\nengrossed with his turrets and his plans for new boats, he fell very\r\nill. Indeed there can be no question that he sacrificed his health to\r\nbuild the gunboats. Never very robust, he was now so ill that eight\r\ndoctors gave him up. His indomitable spirit pulled him through, but he\r\nwas ordered away from his workshop to Europe, he and his family. His\r\noverburden of labor had crushed him,--before this his eyes had been\r\ntired out. Bates charged him to take care of himself; \"the country\r\ncan't spare you,\" he said \"and I can't spare you.\"\r\n\r\nUnless Bates was a prophet, we may well think the first of these\r\nstatements unduly strong. To be sure, when in a crucial moment the\r\ngunboats were needed, and needed quickly, Eads's unparalleled haste in\r\nbuilding them certainly did an inestimable service to the country. But\r\nso far in his career,--and he was over forty,--while he had shown a\r\nmarked inventive talent, he had not as yet made clear his signal genius\r\nfor engineering. And although he had exhibited wonderful executive\r\nability and such true patriotism as made him a valued citizen, he had\r\nstill to render himself indispensable to the development of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE BRIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nEads was bred to the Mississippi. He had mastered its secrets by hard\r\nexperience; he had worked in successful opposition to its great wayward\r\nforces. But he was not to be content till he had tamed it, till he had\r\nsaddled it, and, wild as it will always be, had made it nevertheless\r\nsubservient to him. To his quietly stubborn spirit there was a\r\ndelightful invigoration in using his brain to conquer the brute force\r\nof this capricious monster. For the river is the grandest power between\r\nour two oceans. Niagara is more sublime; but Niagara is constant, and\r\ntherefore its immense strength has been easily set to a task. The\r\nMississippi is so irregular that one tends unconsciously to personify\r\nit by calling it tricky. To find the causes of its sudden changes one\r\nmust go back hundreds of miles to the mountains east and west. Seeming\r\nto delight in destruction, it tears down or eats away the checks that\r\nare put upon it. Only a mind never discouraged, a mind capable of\r\ndiscovering and comprehending the laws that after all underlie the\r\napparently blind and brutal jests of this untiring giant, can, by the\r\nuse of those very laws, tame it. And such a mind Eads had. \"That\r\neverlasting brain of yours will wear out three bodies,\" said one\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThough indeed his body was strong, with iron muscles and a fierce\r\nnervous energy, yet it was not a big body, and his health was weak.\r\nAgain and again he worked beyond his strength, and only on the absolute\r\norder of his doctors would he go away from his work and rest. But he\r\ncould not entirely rest. His brain would work. In his health tours to\r\nEurope he was always open to new ideas, always studying new methods to\r\ncarry back to his task. \"Your recreation,\" some one wrote him, \"is\r\nMonitor discussions with Captain Ericsson.\" Another recreation was\r\nchess. Had he not elected to be the leading engineer of his day, he\r\nmight have been the chess champion. This game, never one for the\r\nslothful and unthinking, he made even more exacting than usual. He\r\nwould play several games at the same time; or, without seeing the board\r\nwhich his opponent used, he would carry the game in his head. Though it\r\nwas his nature not to like to be beaten, yet he was as kindly as he was\r\nset in his purpose; and it was also his nature to take defeat\r\ngracefully: defeat seldom came. \"Never let even a pawn be taken,\" he\r\ngave me, a small boy, as a rule for the game. Even in little things he\r\nliked thoroughness,--a capacity for painstaking which is, I think,\r\ncharacteristic of the \"thoroughbred.\"\r\n\r\nHis appearance showed his traits. Not tall, and rather slight, he was\r\nalways dignified. His wide and thin-lipped mouth shut so emphatically\r\nthat it made plain his intention to do, in spite of all, what he\r\nbelieved could and should be done. Some one said that it was a hundred\r\nhorse-power mouth. It admitted no trifling. When it spoke seriously, it\r\nspoke finally. But his eyes, with their merry twinkle, showed that he\r\ncould also speak humorously. He was indeed a famous story-teller, fond\r\nof all sorts of riddles and jests, and remembering all of them he\r\nheard. He used often to point his arguments with an anecdote, always a\r\nfresh one. Believing with Lamb that a man should enjoy his own stories,\r\nhe would laugh at his in a most infectious way, till he was red in the\r\nface. Indeed, he was the larger half of his stories. His face was\r\nthoughtful and stern. Though he seldom found fault, he never did more\r\nthan once; but he was by no means violent. His mildness was more\r\nforcible than anger. He wore a full beard, but no mustache, thus\r\nexhibiting his long, determined lip. At forty he was already bald, and\r\nafter he was sixty he always wore indoors a black skull-cap.\r\nScrupulously cleanly, in his dress he was point-device. Without the\r\nleast ostentation, his clothes were invariably faultless. From young\r\nmanhood he had thought that it is due to one's self and to one's\r\nfriends to look one's best; and he had also realized the practical\r\nvalue of a good appearance. Often impressing this on his wife and\r\ndaughters, he would have them at all times well dressed. Really he\r\nseems to have been a point too precise. He was just the opposite to\r\nthose geniuses whose great brain shows itself by a sloppy exterior.\r\nEads was never sloppy, even at home.\r\n\r\nHis great brain showed itself in its restless activity, in its grasp of\r\nlaws and of details, in its fight to help and to better the country and\r\nthe world. For it was not only the lusty pleasure of battling with\r\nNature that made him long for another struggle with the Mississippi: he\r\nsaw the value there was in it to commerce and to civilization. Before\r\nthe war he had long contended with stubborn currents, and with ice, and\r\nby his energy and his talent for inventing new devices he had become\r\nthe most successful wrecker on the river. Abandoning the peaceful but\r\nlively triumphs of snatching hulls and cargoes from the maw of the\r\nstream, he had offered the government to cleanse its course and thereby\r\nto increase its safety and usefulness. In war times, owing to his\r\nknowledge of the waterways and of science, he had been able to build,\r\nwith a speed fairly romantic, a gunboat fleet to patrol the\r\nMississippi. Already now greater schemes for improving this central\r\nhighway of our country were in his mind, but as yet the fullness of the\r\ntime was not come. Still, he was no longer merely the careful son and\r\nfather striving to protect his beloved ones and with no dreams of\r\nbroader duties; he was no longer contented with rose-arbors for an\r\noccupation. The grim war had roused him; his years of rest were over;\r\nhe was the well-known boat-builder,--engineer, perhaps some persons\r\nalready called him,--and his mind was teeming with schemes of\r\nhelpfulness. Yet his ambition was not for fame, but to do in the\r\nperfect way the work that only he could do.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 a grand convention for the improvement of the Mississippi and\r\nits tributaries met in Saint Louis. Even then people were beginning to\r\nsee vaguely that the Mississippi Valley is destined to be the ruling\r\nsection of the country. Eads in his speech showed that he foresaw it\r\nplainly. He urged the convention to persuade the government to take\r\nsteps to improve the river; showing that for less money than was paid\r\nby the river boats in three years for insurance against obstructions,\r\nthose obstructions could be removed. There was not one of them, he\r\nsaid, that engineering skill and cunning could not master.\r\n\r\nTwo years later he urged upon the commercial convention at New Orleans\r\nby letter the importance of introducing iron boats on the Mississippi;\r\nsaying that it was the fault of the tariff on iron that the saving they\r\nwould effect was not taken note of. Thirty years later this scheme has\r\nagain been brought up. Perhaps Eads was before his time in advocating\r\nit. But it shows how he had the interests of commerce at heart.\r\n\r\nHis convention speech is a good sample of his style. He was so\r\npainstaking that even in private letters he would insert words and\r\nchange sentences and sometimes rewrite. There are first draughts with\r\nexcisions of whole half pages, for he sought conciseness. He sought\r\nalso a certain rhythm or grace or forcefulness, it is hard to tell\r\nexactly what, since in his letters it often resulted in a rather\r\nself-conscious formality or a stiff playfulness, and in his speeches in\r\na prettiness or a floweriness of style. He sought too carefully.\r\nProbably in delivery the speeches sounded better than we should\r\nimagine. In reading them, they seem florid. That was, however, the\r\nfavorite style of the time. And while, by overdoing it, he often seems\r\nto lose force, he is almost always clear and always entirely logical.\r\nIn contrast to his speeches his professional reports are models: simple\r\nand complete, written not faultlessly perhaps, but with a limpidity\r\nwhich makes one interested even in dry technical details. One of his\r\nmost marked talents, often noted, was the ability to explain an\r\nabstruse subject so that it would be quite clear to anybody. And this\r\nhe did nearly as well in writing as by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nHe thus made clear his remarkable plans for the bridge; for in 1867 the\r\nlong talked of bridge at Saint Louis was at last begun.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, when Eads had arrived at the town, it had about 10,000\r\ninhabitants. Though already seventy years old, it had not advanced very\r\nfar beyond its original state of a French trading-post. With the\r\nintroduction of steam and the waking up of the country, the growth of\r\nSaint Louis was rapid. In 1867 it had about 100,000 people. Despite a\r\ncommanding situation, it could be seen that a struggle would have to be\r\nmade for it to maintain the leadership among the river towns. As early\r\nas 1839 there had been a project for a highway bridge; and we are told\r\nthat \"the city fathers stood aghast\" at an estimated cost of $736,600.\r\nIn the following years there were several more abortive schemes for\r\nbridging, one of which, it is even said, would have been carried out,\r\nhad not its projector died. Perhaps it is as well that he never lived\r\nto try it, for until Eads no one seems to have realized how enormous\r\nthe undertaking was. Probably few others, realizing it, would have\r\ndared to go on.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1865-66 a bill was brought up in Congress to authorize\r\nthe bridging of the Mississippi at Saint Louis. Dependence on ferries\r\nhad become intolerable to the people, and often when the river was\r\nfrozen even the ferries were blocked. A bridge was felt to be\r\nabsolutely indispensable. However, the antagonism of rival commercial\r\nroutes was so powerful that the bill was allowed to pass only after it\r\nhad been so amended that it was supposed to require an impracticability.\r\nIt declared that the central span of the contemplated bridge must be no\r\nless than 500 feet long, nor its elevation above the city directrix\r\nless than fifty feet. It was said at the time \"that the genius did not\r\nexist in the country capable of erecting such a structure.\"\r\n\r\nStill, a span of over 500 feet had been built in Holland; and the fact\r\nthat there was not a total doubt as to the practicability of doing as\r\nwell in the Mississippi Valley is shown by the inauguration of two\r\nrival bridge companies about a year after the passage of the bill. One\r\nof these, which was located in Illinois, after calling a convention of\r\nengineers, who considered the question for ten days, without an\r\nexamination of Eads's plans, adopted a plan for a truss bridge. The\r\nother, the Saint Louis company, from the first had Eads as its chief\r\nengineer. For another year there was a sharp contest carried on between\r\nthese two companies, confined, however, principally to the courts and\r\nthe newspapers, until finally the Illinois company sold out to the\r\nSaint Louis company. Had the truss bridge been built, there is no\r\nknowing how long it might have stood, for the engineer who designed it\r\ndid not arrange to base the foundations on the bed-rock of the river.\r\nAfterwards it was shown how necessary it was to do this; but at the\r\ntime many people thought it quite superfluous, and on that, as well as\r\non many other points, Eads met with opposition.\r\n\r\nIn every case it turned out that he had been right. No one else knew so\r\nwell as he the immense power and the waywardness of the Mississippi.\r\nGood engineers supposed that the greatest imaginable scour at the river\r\nbottom in extreme high water would not remove over twenty-two feet of\r\nsand, and it was believed that there were perhaps one hundred feet of\r\nit along the east shore. But Eads had been sixty-five feet below the\r\nriver's surface at Cairo, and there he had found the river bottom to be\r\na moving mass at least three feet deep; and in cutting through the\r\nfrozen river to liberate his diving-bell boats, he had found that the\r\nfloating ice which goes underneath solid ice, as well as the rising or\r\n\"backing-up\" of the water above ice-gorges, forces the undercurrents\r\nlower than even a flood does; and he had found on cutting a wreck out\r\nof the ice that she had been held up by the gorged ice underneath her,\r\nwhich must therefore have been packed to the bottom. Knowing all this\r\nand much more about what goes on under the turbid surface of the river,\r\nhe did not doubt that even beneath 100 feet of sand the bed-rock might\r\nat times be laid bare, and he was absolutely convinced that his bridge\r\nmust be founded on it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he saw that on account of the exceptional force of the\r\ncurrent in its rather narrow bed at Saint Louis, the masonry piers of\r\nhis bridge must be made unusually big and strong to withstand it. Since\r\nthey must be so big and sunk so very deep, it was evident that they\r\nwould be so costly that the fewer there need be of them the better. The\r\ncentral span was required to be 500 feet; with three spans about that\r\nlength the river could be crossed, and three spans would require only\r\nfour piers. Steel trusses 500 feet long would have to be made extremely\r\nheavy; but Eads showed that a steel arch the same length, while quite\r\nas strong, would be lighter and consequently much cheaper. When his\r\nopponents objected that there was no engineering precedent for such\r\nspans, while he pointed out their mistake, at the same time he\r\nexpressed his conviction that engineering precedents had nothing to do\r\nwith the question of length of span; that it was altogether a money\r\nquestion. Therefore, since the cheapest method was to be carefully\r\nsought, he determined upon arches,--two abutment piers, two river\r\npiers, and three arches of respectively 502, 520, and 502 feet long.\r\n\r\nThere were many opponents to this plan; some of them people who would\r\nhave opposed any bridge, as, for example, the ferry and the transfer\r\ncompanies. To his own company he explained away every objection that\r\ncame up, as he was bound to do, in view of their confidence in him. He\r\nmade the clearest of explanations of the theories involved; and even\r\nsuch absurd predictions as that his superstructure would crush his huge\r\nstone piers, he took the trouble to blast sarcastically. To an\r\nengineering journal he wrote three letters correcting mistakes in its\r\naccounts of his work. But he seems to have wasted little of his energy\r\nin arguing with the newspaper public. It was a question only of time\r\ntill everybody should be convinced.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary care and pains were expended in every direction.\r\nThe stone, granite, and steel were both hunted up and tested by\r\nexperts, and by machines specially devised in the bridge works, though\r\nnot by Eads himself. For his assistants he chose men who were of real\r\nability and well trained, and to them he invariably gave great credit\r\nfor their part in the work. The plans, after being figured out in\r\ndetail by them, were gone over by the mathematician Chauvenet, then\r\nchancellor of Washington University, who found not one single error in\r\nthem. Most of the big work, such as the masonry and steel, was given\r\nout on contract; and, as was natural, delays by the contractors often\r\ngreatly delayed the progress of the bridge. The whole work occupied\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\nWhile Eads had promised the company to prove by careful experiment, so\r\nfar as was possible, everything connected with the bridge that had not\r\nalready been fully demonstrated in practice, he did not pretend that in\r\nhis main outlines he was without some examples. It was in his\r\ndevelopment of known ideas and his expedients for simplification that\r\nhis genius perhaps most strikingly showed itself. Again and again he\r\ncontrived some device so simple that, like a great many strokes of\r\ngenius, it seemed that anybody should have thought of it. The massive\r\npiers were sunk to the bed-rock by means of metal caissons. These were\r\nadapted in design from some he had seen in use in France, and had\r\nexamined during a trip his doctors ordered him to make in 1868. Eads\r\nhimself compared them to inverted pans. They were open at the bottom,\r\nbut perfectly air-tight everywhere else. They had several important\r\nfeatures which were entirely original. Such caissons, sunk to the\r\nbottom, have the masonry of the pier built on top of them even while\r\nthey are sinking; and workmen inside them keep removing the sand from\r\nunderneath, and throwing it under the mouths of pipes which suck it up\r\nto the surface of the river. Evidently the caissons must be filled with\r\ncompressed air to equalize the external pressure, which is constantly\r\nincreasing as ever deeper water is reached; they must also have an\r\nopening connecting with the surface; and to admit of passing from the\r\nordinary atmosphere to the denser one, there must be an air-lock.\r\nBefore this bridge was built, the air-lock had always been placed at\r\nthe top of the entrance shaft, where, as the caisson sank and the shaft\r\nwas lengthened, it had to be constantly moved up. Eads placed it in the\r\nair-chamber of the caisson itself, where it never had to be moved; and\r\nthus, as the shaft was not filled with compressed air, less was needed,\r\nand there was less danger of leaks. Another of his useful innovations\r\nwas to build his shaft of wood, and another was to put a spiral\r\nstairway into it. Indeed, in the last pier he put an elevator into the\r\nshaft. Moreover, he was the first person to run his pipes for\r\ndischarging the sand, not through the shaft, but through the masonry\r\nitself; and he invented a very simple and effectual new sand-pump,\r\nwhich was worked by natural forces without machinery. All these\r\nimprovements and various others seem to have been thought of so easily,\r\nthat we are inclined to wonder why clumsier methods had ever been in\r\nuse. He described them all in his reports and his letters about the\r\nbridge in a style which is not only clear but actually fascinating even\r\nto a person who has scant scientific knowledge or taste.\r\n\r\nOne of the piers was sunk 110 feet below the surface of the river,\r\nthrough ninety feet of gravel and sand. Eads's theories were justified\r\nby finding the bed-rock so smooth and water-worn as to show that at\r\ntimes it had been uncovered. This was the deepest submarine work that\r\nhad ever been done, and Eads tells us in his reports many interesting\r\nexperiments he made in the air-chambers. In their dense atmosphere a\r\ncandle when blown out would at once light again. This was before the\r\ndays of electric lighting: otherwise we may be sure that that would\r\nhave been used, as so many other modern inventions were. For the first\r\ntime in any such work, the last pier sunk had telegraphic\r\ncommunications with the offices on shore; which must have been\r\ncomforting to workmen starting out to their labor in the dead of winter\r\nwith two weeks' provisions. The dense air of the chambers caused not\r\nonly discomfort to the ears, but also in the case of some of the\r\nworkmen a partial paralysis. There was no previous experience to go by,\r\nbut every precaution seen to be necessary was taken; the hours of work\r\nwere made very short, the elevator was provided, medical attendance and\r\nhospital care were given free. After the first disasters no man was\r\nallowed to work in the air-chambers without a doctor's permit. And it\r\nis known that in helping the sufferers with his private means, Eads was\r\nas charitable as ever. Out of 352 men employed in the various\r\nair-chambers, 12 died. Eads, with his wonted generosity of praise,\r\nprinted in his yearly report the names of all the men who worked in the\r\ndeepest pier from its beginning till it touched bed-rock. It is\r\ninteresting to note in passing that of all the workmen in the\r\nblacksmith's yard only the head smith himself could lift a greater\r\nweight than the designer of the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe superstructure consisted mainly of three steel arches, by far the\r\nlongest that had ever been constructed; the first to dispense with\r\nspandrel bracing; and the first to be built of cast-steel. The\r\n\"Encyclopædia Britannica\" called them \"the finest example of a metal\r\narch yet erected.\" They were built out from the piers from both ends to\r\nmeet in the middle; and were put into place entirely without staging\r\nfrom below,--once again, the first instance of such a proceeding. All\r\nthe necessary working platforms and machinery were suspended from\r\ntemporary towers built on the piers; and thus while the arches were\r\nbeing put up, navigation below was not interfered with. This throwing\r\nacross of the 500-foot arches without the use of false works has been\r\nranked with the sinking of the piers \"through a hundred feet of\r\nshifting quicksands,\" as producing \"some of the most difficult problems\r\never attempted by an engineer.\" One problem, caused by the fault of the\r\ncontractors, presented itself when they came to insert the central\r\ntubes to close the arches. The tubes were found to be two and a half\r\ninches too long to go in, although they would be only the required\r\nlength when they were in. It was left for Eads to insert them.\r\nShortening them would of course have lowered the arch. Eads, who was\r\njust starting for London on financial business of the bridge, cut the\r\ntubes in half, joining them by a plug with a right and left screw. Then\r\nhe cut off their ends, for the plug would make them any required length\r\nby inserting or withdrawing the screws a little. Then he went away. As\r\nit would have been much cheaper not to use this device, his assistants\r\ntried for hours to shrink the tubing by ice applications, and thus to\r\nget the arches closed; and there is a popular tradition in Saint Louis\r\nthat they succeeded; but it was excessively hot weather, and they did\r\nnot succeed. The screw-plug tubes, of course, were easily put in. Any\r\npart of this steel work can be at any time safely removed and\r\nreplaced,--another structural feature original in this bridge.\r\n\r\nAlthough Eads took care to protect his special innovations by patent,\r\nhe was most willing to explain them with care to other engineers and to\r\nhave others profit by his improvements; and several of the mechanical\r\nnovelties of his bridge are now in the commonest use, and have been\r\ntaken advantage of even in such famous structures as the Brooklyn\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\nDuring the building of the bridge Eads spent many months in enforced\r\nabsence, but while in Europe he always had his labor in mind, and, as I\r\nhave said, brought home from France one of his most useful appliances.\r\nDuring his absence he left absolutely trustworthy and efficient\r\nengineers in charge of the work, and before leaving home he provided\r\nfor accidents that might occur. So much work was done in the winter\r\nthat great barriers had to be built to keep it clear of floating ice.\r\nOne curious detail connected with the bridge is that the Milwaukee, one\r\nof the double-turreted gunboats which Eads had built from his own\r\nplans, and which had been with Farragut at Mobile, was bought now from\r\na wrecking company, and her iron hull used in making the caissons; so\r\nthat her usefulness still continued in peace as in war.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of Eads that he grappled with great problems in\r\nengineering, and solved them as easily as a boy subtracts two from six.\r\nWhile this is true, it must not be forgotten that he had not the\r\nschool-training of an engineer. Nothing is more untrue than the\r\nstatement that he was, like de Lesseps, only a contractor. He was a\r\nvery unusually brilliant engineer, and his ignorance of the higher\r\nmathematics served to show his brilliancy the more clearly. Some\r\npersons have said that his chief talent was in explaining abstruse\r\nreasonings simply; but an engineer has told me that he thought Eads's\r\nchief talent was his ability to arrive by some rough means at a certain\r\nconclusion to a given problem, which conclusion would in every instance\r\nbe approximately the same that better trained mathematicians would\r\nreach by mathematics.\r\n\r\nBy the time the bridge was finished, indeed from the time (1868) when\r\nhis first report for it made a decided stir in the scientific world,\r\nboth at home and abroad, Eads was a very well-known engineer. In that\r\nsame year a visit to Europe for his health's sake gave him the\r\nopportunity to interview a French steel company, through whom he met a\r\nfamous bridge-builder, and was led to examine the piers of the bridge\r\nthen being constructed at Vichy; and it was there that he found his new\r\nideas for caissons. Going home, by way of England, he explained his\r\nplans to the engineers there, and was by them proposed as a member of\r\nthe Royal Society. Even at home, in his own adopted State, he was not\r\nwithout recognition; for in 1872 the University of Missouri conferred\r\nupon him the honorary degree of LL.D. From the general of engineers he\r\nreceived a request for suggestions for improvements in guns; and from\r\nhis work on the subject of Naval Defenses it is plain that his mind\r\nstill found time to run on this favorite topic.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the bridge was finished. After it had satisfactorily stood the\r\nsevere tests put upon it, it was formally opened on the 4th of July.\r\nThe celebrations of that day were the first public outburst of approval\r\ngiven to Eads's work. And to-day the strong and graceful bridge stands\r\nas his most beautiful and lasting monument. And as even the great\r\ntornado of 1896 was unable to do the piers any serious damage, they are\r\nlikely to last indefinitely, and thus make the bridge \"endure,\" as its\r\nbuilder said, \"as long as it is useful to man.\"\r\n\r\nTo Saint Louis it has been so useful that while on the one hand the\r\ngrowth of the city was the cause of its being built, on the other it\r\nhas been one great cause of the continued growth and prosperity of the\r\ncity. But it had even broader results than that. \"It made a radical\r\nchange in the conditions of transportation East and West, and it made\r\npossible the Memphis bridge and the future New Orleans bridge.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in another direction yet it is peculiarly important. In\r\nbridge-building it marks an era, not only because of its strength and\r\nbeauty and the daring of its design, but also because of its many\r\nlabor-saving devices, the inventions of a thoroughly practical mind. A\r\ndistinguished engineer calls it \"a great pioneer in the art of sinking\r\ndeep foundations and building spans over wide stretches of space, that\r\nastonished in its construction the entire civilized world.\" London\r\n\"Engineering\" chose it, while building, as preëminently the \"most\r\nhighly developed type of bridge;\" and says, \"In that work the alliance\r\nbetween the theorist and the practical man is complete.\" In Eads it\r\nfinds its long-sighed-for dream, combining the highest powers of modern\r\nanalysis with the ingenuity of the builder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE JETTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi River is a great antimonopolist. As more and more\r\nrailways have been built it has been less and less used. And yet,\r\nbecause it drains almost every corner of a valley which comprises over\r\none third of the whole United States, it affords means of\r\ntransportation to an immense area; and since it cannot be controlled by\r\nany one company or group of companies, its freight rates can hardly be\r\narbitrarily fixed. Still, so long as there are impediments to its free\r\nnavigation in the shape of floods and bars, it cannot be depended on\r\nfor shipping, and the magnificent opportunities it should offer to\r\ncommerce are lessened. The vastest river system in the world, it shows\r\nin its various parts great contrasts. One large tributary flowing from\r\nthe Alleghanies, one from the Rockies, one from the north, others from\r\nthe southwestern plains, are each able to contribute their various\r\nproducts of grain, lumber, cattle, cotton, fruits, and so on. Some\r\nbranches freeze every winter; others never do. Some are clear, others\r\nsilt-bearing. From about Cairo it flows southward through the greater\r\ndelta, or land built up by its own action in ages past, and in all this\r\npart of its course both banks and bottom are of yielding alluvion. For\r\nsome hundreds of miles \"the crookedest of great rivers,\" it varies\r\nfrequently in width and velocity and is full of shoals; then for\r\nhundreds more, though uniform in width, it often rises higher than its\r\nshores, and is confined in artificial levees, which it continually\r\nbreaks down. Finally, below New Orleans, growing more sluggish, and\r\ndividing into several mouths, or \"passes,\" it wanders through tracts of\r\nwaste marsh-lands into the gulf, which it colors brown for miles\r\naround. Blocking the end of each shallow mouth there was formerly a\r\nsand-bar; and these obstructions to navigation were the despair of the\r\nriver commerce, and no less the despair of the government in its\r\nattempts to remove them.\r\n\r\nEvery one interested in trade or shipping realized what a very serious\r\nhindrance to the usefulness of the Mississippi these choked-up mouths\r\nwere, but no one realized it better than Eads. Understanding that the\r\ngreat valley is capable of supporting 400,000,000 people, and intent on\r\ndoing all in his power for good, even before he had completed the\r\nbridge he was studying the problem of opening the river. Its\r\nimprovement and the welfare of its millions of people were cherished\r\nobjects of his life. For some men one great undertaking at a time is\r\nenough, but Eads's energies were such that his works overlapped one\r\nanother. It is hard to see how one man can have time, even if he has\r\nbrains, to do all he did. But apparently he never lived an idle day.\r\nThe bridge, with its many extraordinary solutions of new problems, made\r\nits builder's permanent reputation. At the particular request of West\r\nPoint he had supplied that institution with writings, diagrams, and\r\nmodels. And so far afield had his fame spread that on one of his many\r\ntrips abroad, he made plans, at the request of the Sultan's grand\r\nvizier, for an iron bridge over the Bosphorus. A change in viziers,\r\nhowever, prevented its being built.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if the river-mouth problem had not always been so\r\ndifficult. Still, Eads showed that the bars were inevitable; and it is\r\nprobably only because, with the growing population and trade of the\r\ncentral States, the need for an outlet was greater, that the problem\r\nseemed more complicated. Moreover, ocean vessels were increasing in\r\nsize and draught, which also made an adequate channel more desirable.\r\nAlthough the blockade had forced the construction of several expensive\r\nlines of railway, yet it was impossible to carry all the products of\r\nthe valley by rail. Millions of dollars' worth of merchandise were\r\ndelayed at the bars. As early as 1726 attempts had been made to deepen\r\nthe channels through the river's mouths by harrowing. But the first\r\ngovernment effort was in 1837, when an appropriation was made for a\r\nsurvey and for dredging with buckets. Again in 1852 another\r\nappropriation was made; and a board, appointed by the War Department,\r\nrecommended,--\r\n\r\n    1. Stirring up the bottom.\r\n\r\n    2. Dredging.\r\n\r\n    3. If both these methods failed, the construction of parallel\r\n    jetties \"five miles in length, at the mouth of the South West Pass,\r\n    to be extended into the gulf annually, as experience should show to\r\n    be necessary.\"\r\n\r\n    4. \"Should it then be needed, the lateral outlets should be\r\n    closed.\"\r\n\r\n    5. Should all these fail, a ship canal might be made.\r\n\r\nDredging by stirring the bottom was tried, and produced a depth of\r\neighteen feet. Three years later this depth had entirely disappeared.\r\nIn 1856 an appropriation was entered into, but the jetties were never\r\ncompleted. Later than that dredging was tried again. Up to 1875 more\r\nthan eighteen feet of depth had never been obtained, and even that\r\ncould not be steadily preserved. Channels, opened in low water, were\r\nquickly filled up with sediment in high water, and sometimes a severe\r\nstorm would wash in enough sand from the gulf to undo the result of\r\nmonths of dredging.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1832 a ship canal near Fort Saint Philip, which should cut\r\nthrough the river bank out to the gulf, had been planned, and this\r\nsolution had been approved of by the Louisiana legislature. That idea\r\nhad been revived from time to time. And there had also more than once\r\nbeen new recommendations made for jetties, which by narrowing the\r\nchannel should deepen it. Finally Congress ordered surveys and plans\r\nfor the canal, and then appointed a board not only to report on them,\r\nbut also to ascertain the feasibility of improving the channel of one\r\nof the natural outlets of the river. In 1874 this board reported in\r\nfavor of the canal, and against the idea of jetties, which, in its\r\nopinion, could hardly be built, could not be maintained, and would be\r\nexcessively costly.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the situation when Eads appeared on the scene:\r\n\"scratching and scraping\" were going on in South West Pass, but were\r\ndoing little real and no lasting good; the government engineers had\r\ndeclared themselves in favor of a canal; and though in some quarters\r\njetties had been advocated, scarcely any one thought they could be\r\nbuilt, or that if they were they would last, or that they would do any\r\ngood. Eads, however, understood the river like a book, and he had\r\nstudied this particular subject. He now came forward publicly, offering\r\nnot only to build and to maintain jetties which would insure a\r\ntwenty-eight foot channel, but to do all this for less than half the\r\ncost the board had estimated, and on a contract which should provide\r\nfor his being paid only in case he succeeded. From this remarkable\r\noffer his own confidence in his plans may be inferred. A purpose which\r\nhe had reasoned out as practical became an inspiration to him which\r\nnothing could shake, for his courage equaled his convictions.\r\n\r\nBut so bold was his proposition that he was considered a wild\r\nenthusiast. Never at a loss to solve any problem, again, as when he\r\nplanned the bridge, he undertook to do what was commonly held to be\r\nimpossible. Of course, all the backers of the canal scheme opposed him\r\nbitterly. New Orleans was of that faction. Saint Louis, on the other\r\nhand, upheld him because of his personal popularity and his signal\r\nsuccess with the bridge. The army engineers were against him as a civil\r\nengineer. Thus the controversy was sectional, personal, and\r\nprofessional. Up to this time the government had invariably intrusted\r\nall works of river and harbor improvement to the military engineers;\r\nand to hand over the most important one it had ever undertaken to a\r\nprivate citizen, and to permit him to apply a method that had just been\r\ncondemned in a report signed by six out of seven of the most\r\ndistinguished army engineers, met with decided opposition. So the\r\ngovernment hesitated. Certainly this was a proposal to make them\r\nconsider, promising, as it did, an open river mouth, at a cost much\r\nlower than that of the canal, and in case of failure leaving the total\r\nloss to fall upon the contractor. Besides, several eminent civil\r\nengineers supported Eads's theory. The House, nevertheless, passed the\r\ncanal bill; but the Senate, more thorough, after calling Eads and two\r\nof his principal opponents to state their views before a committee,\r\npassed a bill appointing a commission to reconsider the entire subject\r\nonce more. The discussion before the Senate committee was one of the\r\ncrises in Eads's life. The fate of the jetty enterprise hung on the\r\noutcome of it. Fortunately for himself and for the good of the country,\r\nhe was a most magnetic and persuasive man. His theories and arguments\r\nwere sound and logical, his experience of the river was vast; and\r\nbeyond his aptitude for making technical reasoning simple and clear,\r\nhis skill as a diplomatist was equal to his ability as an engineer.\r\n\r\nSo the commission was appointed; and, ultimately, on account of the\r\nfar-reaching importance of the question of river-mouth improvement, its\r\nmembers decided to go to Europe to inquire into the matter. About the\r\nsame time, and for the same purpose, Eads also went abroad, and while\r\nthere he made a careful study of the works at the mouths of the Danube,\r\nthe Rhone, and several other European rivers. What he saw there served\r\nonly to strengthen his confidence in his own plans. When he returned\r\nhome, there had been a noteworthy change in public sentiment. Though\r\nthere still remained many either prejudiced or honest enemies to his\r\nplan, and although the newspapers were still noisy with their cheap and\r\nignorant opposition, the country at large and Congress were inclined to\r\naccept the offer, which promised them so much at no risk at all.\r\n\r\nThe commission, returning too from Europe, where it had made as careful\r\ninvestigations as those of Eads, reported, by a majority of six to one,\r\nin favor of trying jetties in the South Pass. This pass, the smallest\r\nof the three mouths, had a depth of only eight feet on its bar, and had\r\nbesides a shoal at its head. The South West Pass, the one which Eads\r\nhad proposed to use, is not only two or three times as big, both in\r\nwidth and in volume of water, but it had fourteen feet on the bar, and\r\nno shoal at its head. Eads argued and implored with all his strength to\r\nbe allowed to use the larger pass, as the only one adequate to the\r\ndemands of commerce; and so convincing were his reasons that the House\r\npassed a bill which called for jetties in the larger pass. But the\r\nSenate, again more conservative, was cautious in this experiment, and\r\ninsisted on the small pass. Finally, the bill went through, and the\r\ngrant was made for the improvement of South Pass. And notwithstanding\r\nthe considerable difference in size, as well as preliminary conditions\r\naltogether less promising than in the pass Eads had asked for, still,\r\nthe depth of thirty feet was to be obtained,--the same result under\r\nharder circumstances. The payment promised, however, was not increased\r\nwith the difficulty; but on the contrary was to be a good deal less\r\nthan the estimate of the commission. The terms, which required certain\r\nspecified depths and widths of channel to be obtained and then\r\nmaintained during twenty years, were so arranged that Eads should not\r\nreceive any part of his payment till after the work covered by that\r\npart had been finished and approved.\r\n\r\nHard as these conditions were, they were based on his own proposal, and\r\nhe was glad even on such terms to undertake the great work he had\r\nlonged to do. He at once busied himself in raising money for beginning\r\nthe Jetties, and here again his peculiar talents helped him. One of his\r\nfriends has said, \"His powers of persuasion, his charm of address, and\r\nthe magnetism of his personality opened the hearts and purses of\r\nwhomever he pleaded with in support of his engineering devices. He was\r\na most lovable man.\" Moreover, he was an excellent business man. He had\r\nindeed a marvelous faculty for obtaining funds with which to carry on\r\nhis works; and in that time of financial distress such a faculty was\r\nvery necessary.\r\n\r\nThe theory on which he based his jetties was really extremely simple.\r\nHe said that, other things being equal, the amount of sediment which a\r\nriver can carry is in direct proportion to its velocity. When, for any\r\nreason, the current becomes slower at any special place, it drops part\r\nof its burden of sediment at that place, and when it becomes faster\r\nagain it picks up more. Now, one thing that makes a river slower is an\r\nincrease of its width, because then there is more frictional surface;\r\nand contrariwise, one of the things that make it faster is a narrowing\r\nof its width. Narrow the Mississippi then, at its mouth, said Eads, and\r\nit will become swifter there, and consequently it will remove its soft\r\nbottom by picking up the sediment (of which it will then hold much\r\nmore), and by carrying it out to the gulf, to be lost in deep water and\r\nswept away by currents; and thus, he said, you will have your deep\r\nchannel. In other words, if you give the river some assistance by\r\nkeeping its current together, it will do all the necessary labor and\r\nscour out its own bottom.\r\n\r\nToday, since this theory has been proved, it seems as simple as A B C.\r\nAnd it is almost impossible to believe what opposition it then aroused.\r\nPeople were not only set on blocking the undertaking, but they were\r\nactually ignorant enough to deny that the velocity of water had any\r\nconnection with its sediment-carrying power. Even if the narrowing\r\nprocess should happen to give a channel through the present bar, they\r\nsaid, a new one would presently form beyond, and so the jetties would\r\nhave to be extended every year.\r\n\r\nHowever, Eads had his contract and his backers and his ideas and his\r\nfaith in them; and he set to work on the little pass. The actual delta\r\nof the Mississippi consists of nothing but water, marsh, and some sandy\r\nsoil bearing willows. At the sea end of South Pass Eads extended the\r\nlow banks out over the bar, by driving rows of guide-piles and sinking\r\nwillow mattresses close alongside them on the riverside. The mattresses\r\nwere sunk in tiers, and each tier was weighted well with rock, put in\r\nas soon as each mattress was in position. As usual he invented many of\r\nthe requisite mechanical appliances and contrivances himself, and\r\ngenerally such good ones that his methods came to take the place of\r\nearlier ones. The South Pass was not only the smallest and shallowest\r\nof the mouths, but it was besides more difficult than the other two in\r\nhaving a bar at its head as well as at its sea end. And although by his\r\ncontract Eads was not required to remove that bar, by the exigencies of\r\nthe case he was. Like the other it had to be attacked with water,\r\nguided by dikes and dams, which were similar in construction to the two\r\nparallel banks, the jetties proper. The scheme was always to force the\r\nriver itself to do all the real work; and though there was, to be sure,\r\na good deal of planning and building, the main idea, as already\r\nexplained, is exceedingly simple. Eads never pretended to have\r\noriginated this idea. He had studied many jetties in Europe. He had had\r\nthe eye to see that they could be adapted to the Mississippi, and the\r\nskill to adapt them. For simple as the bald theory is, there was need\r\nof the nicest appreciation of laws and forces in applying it, and the\r\nresult has been called the greatest engineering feat ever accomplished.\r\nThe problem of making the quantity of water needed run _up_ into the\r\nsmallest pass \"through a narrow, artificially contracted channel,\r\nlocated immediately between two great natural outlets,\"--this problem\r\nbeing complicated by many \"occult conditions,\"--has been called, by no\r\nmean engineer, perhaps the most difficult problem ever dealt with\r\nsuccessfully. \"There is no instance, indeed, in the world where such a\r\nvast volume of water is placed under such absolute and permanent\r\ncontrol of the engineer, through methods so economic and simple.\"\r\n\r\nTo the non-mechanical mind the control of such a multitude of abstruse,\r\nminute, and exact details as combine in the making of a bridge seems\r\nperhaps more marvelous than the mere bending of nature's forces to\r\nserve the ends of man. In Eads the power to do both existed.\r\n\r\nOn piles in the marsh houses were built for the engineers and the\r\nworkmen, and the Jetties were begun. Eads was not able to be there in\r\nperson all the time, but as usual his choice of competent and faithful\r\nlieutenants was noteworthy. His plans were approved by an advisory\r\nboard of very eminent engineers; and by the end of one year the value\r\nof the work began to show. As yet it was not very strong or solid, but\r\nit had deepened the water on the bar from nine to sixteen feet.\r\n\r\nNone the less the storm of detraction continued. There were enough\r\ndifficulties to meet without this, but none of them was met more\r\nforcibly. It was never Eads's way to attack other people in a malicious\r\nspirit, for he was never jealous; nor did he often deign to answer\r\npurely personal attacks. But in defense of his undertakings, to protect\r\nthem and the people who had put money into them, he was ready to fight.\r\nHis defense commonly took the form of criticism of his critics, and in\r\nsuch writing his pen was decidedly trenchant. Probably no man ever\r\nincurred more foolish criticism, and probably none ever pointed out\r\nmore plainly how foolish it was. Even \"the ablest of his adversaries\r\nconfessed themselves afraid of his pen.\" Besides this parrying of\r\nattack, he was continually writing and talking to show the simplicity\r\nand feasibility of his method; and one man phrased what it is likely\r\nmany exemplified, that a few minutes' conversation with Eads had done\r\nmore to convert him to the Jetties than any amount of writing and of\r\ntalking with other people could have done. Always modest and\r\nunassuming, he was so thoroughly in earnest that he convinced others by\r\nhis own conviction.\r\n\r\nNever was a man less afraid to work. Years before, in the diving-bell\r\ndays, he had set himself the precedent of never asking an employee to\r\ndo what he himself would fear to do. And, on the other hand, he did not\r\nhesitate to ask an employee to do as much work as he himself would have\r\ndone. His former confidential clerk has told me that sometimes, after\r\nevenings of discussion, Eads on starting to bed, perhaps at midnight,\r\nwould say to him, \"Now, have that figured out for me in the morning,\"\r\nwhich meant three or four hours of scrupulous figuring or writing to be\r\ndone by eight the next morning.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly he could not have worked so hard as he did himself had he\r\nnot been able to throw aside his cares and problems when he was not\r\nactively engaged with them. A very sociable man, he liked not only to\r\nbe with people, but to be making them enjoy themselves. Thus he was\r\nboth generous and jovial. No one loved more to give presents; no one\r\nknew more droll stories and more poetry. Nor was his joviality by any\r\nmeans a descent; for not only before royalty was he dignified, but in\r\nthe most democratic assembly. His was not, however, a forbidding\r\ndignity. Simple-hearted as a child, he was fond of children, and they\r\nwere fond of him.\r\n\r\nOf course, he kept up his miscellaneous reading. He was specially\r\ndevoted to poetry; and loved not only to recite verse upon verse aloud,\r\nbut also to read to his friends and associates. As usual, his\r\nenthusiasm spread to others. One old lady has told me that she never\r\nhad thought much of poetry till she heard him read it. Burns and Edwin\r\nArnold and Tennyson were favorites; and there is a letter written by\r\nEads to Tennyson, apparently to send him a clipping in which the one\r\nwas described reciting from the other's poems. Eads excuses himself for\r\nintruding with his tribute, and remarks that both of them have built\r\nworks destined to outlive their authors. He says it quite modestly and\r\ncandidly, \"as equal comes to equal; throne to throne.\"\r\n\r\nYet despite the confidence of their builder, despite his cheerfulness,\r\nthe Jetties were not getting along well. To be sure, they were steadily\r\ndeepening the channel, and thereby proving to all ingenuous persons who\r\nwere undeceived that jetties were what had long been needed, and that\r\nthey should be helped along and finished. But the Jetties were situated\r\nfar off in a remote marshland where few people saw them; consequently\r\nnearly everybody was either deceived or was disingenuous. People who\r\nhad no business to interfere did interfere. Every hitch was shouted\r\nabroad, every success was concealed or twisted. Concrete difficulties\r\nwere enormous. Sudden storms at just the wrong time delayed and undid\r\nthe work. The need for more money was pressing, and it could be\r\nborrowed only at exorbitant rates of interest. The newspapers were\r\nclamoring that the rash experiment was a failure; and though, of\r\ncourse, it was not a failure, still it might have fallen through, when\r\none day the Cromwell liner, Hudson, drawing over fourteen feet of\r\nwater, came in through the Jetties, and they were saved.\r\n\r\nAlthough the prestige of the undertaking was thus established, Eads\r\nrealized that his contract with the government was too severe. Not that\r\nhe asked to be paid beforehand for his work, but he did ask to be paid\r\nas the work was actually done. So evident were his energy, skill, and\r\ngood faith that Congress promptly voted him an advance of a million\r\ndollars. It also sent a commission to inspect and to report on the\r\nprogress and efficiency of the works. This commission, while reporting\r\nfavorably, advised against any further advance payments. But Congress,\r\nnevertheless, voted him three-quarters of a million more. It is said\r\nthat this is the only instance where the government has voted money to\r\nan individual in advance of the specific terms of his agreement.\r\nMoreover, his contract was re-arranged so as to be less oppressive.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that if Eads had failed with the Jetties he would not\r\nonly have destroyed his reputation, but he would have been a\r\nbeggar,--though, some one added, he would still have deserved\r\neverlasting gratitude for his efforts and sacrifices. And now he had\r\nalready succeeded in changing the little pass into a grand channel of\r\ncommerce sufficient for the largest shipping that visited New Orleans.\r\nYet the violent opposition and the calumnies still continued. There was\r\na wonderful persistency in the false reports which came from bitter\r\nopponents who would not be convinced. The foolishness and ignorance of\r\ntheir arguments are almost incredible. But however foolish, they had to\r\nbe disproved; and Eads set himself patiently to work to point out the\r\nerrors in logic and in physics; and in doing so he wrote what those who\r\nknow call one of the greatest works on river hydraulics.\r\n\r\nWhile there were so many men's hands against Eads, it is pleasant to\r\nrecord that there were also many for him. It was the \"Scientific\r\nAmerican\" which first suggested his name for the presidency. It\r\nadvocated him as a fearless, honest, and forceful man; but the peculiar\r\ncompliment in it was that this was a technical paper that upheld him.\r\nThe proposal was repeated in many newspapers, but Eads had no more\r\nintention now than ever of going into politics. He knew in what line he\r\ncould do most for his country, and had an ambition rather to be a\r\nsupremely useful engineer than to be president.\r\n\r\nAnother of his admirers was the late Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II.,\r\nwho, after a visit to the Jetties, first tried to persuade Eads to go\r\nto Brazil to do some very important work for him, and who then, failing\r\nthat, sent him a personal letter asking him to recommend an engineer.\r\nAnd he engaged the one whom Eads recommended.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, a little over four years from the time the Jetties were begun,\r\nthe United States inspecting officer there reported the maximum depth\r\nof thirty feet and the required width and depths throughout the\r\nchannel. Thereupon all the remainder of the price agreed was paid over\r\nto Eads, excepting a million dollars, which was kept, at interest, as a\r\nguarantee, during twenty years' actual maintenance of the channel.\r\nOmitting from the count every day of deficient channel, these twenty\r\nyears are now (1900) almost over; the results in the channel and in the\r\npart of the gulf just beyond the Jetties have been precisely and\r\nentirely what the projector of the works predicted when he began them.\r\nThe bar has never formed again. The Jetties themselves, so far from\r\nhaving to be lengthened, are shorter than they were originally\r\ndesigned. In a word, the sole legitimate objection that can be made to\r\nthem is that they do not furnish a great enough depth. Of course they\r\nfurnish the required depth, and as great a depth undoubtedly as can\r\npossibly be had in the little South Pass. Ships, however, now draw more\r\nwater than they did twenty-five years ago, and a still deeper channel\r\nis needed. The best proof of the success of the present one is that the\r\ngovernment is preparing to apply the same plan to the big South West\r\nPass, which Eads begged to open and was not allowed to. It is said that\r\nin that pass he would have produced thirty feet in one year. But\r\nnothing is more useless to discuss than what might have been. What Eads\r\nhas accomplished with his Jetties is certain.\r\n\r\nOne result of his achievement was a quick improvement in prices. Every\r\nacre, mill, farmhouse in the whole of the Mississippi Valley was\r\nincreased in value by the impetus which the open river-mouth gave to\r\ncommerce. New Orleans rose from the eleventh to the second export city\r\nin the country. Consequently there was a great increase in the number\r\nof lines of ships going there, and in their tonnage. And as a result of\r\nthat there was a rapid increase in railway facilities. In twenty years\r\nfrom the commencement of the Jetties there was a gain of one hundred\r\nper cent. in the total commerce of New Orleans, nearly all of it due to\r\nthese works. This boom has, despite the marvelous multiplication of\r\nrailways, preserved the river traffic; and the river traffic, as\r\nalways, has by competition lowered freight rates. The effect has spread\r\nto remote districts; and by this reduction in rates and prices there is\r\nno doubt that the Jetties have made living cheaper on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard as well as in the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nEven more: in another way they have made living cheaper. The\r\nhalf-rail-and-half-water route from the Pacific coast to New York via\r\nNew Orleans, which the Jetties first made possible, forced the\r\ntranscontinental railways to cut down their time for shipping freight\r\nover one half. The tonnage by this newer route has increased\r\nenormously, and its competition has affected commerce by reducing all\r\nrates from the Mississippi Valley and the West and the Pacific slope to\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard and to Europe. As a consequence bread has been\r\nmade cheaper to all the great populations that require the food\r\nproducts of the central zone and the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nAnother very different but curious change is probably largely due to\r\nthe Jetties. Before their construction only very light-draught ships\r\ncould safely reach New Orleans; but it was so favorite a cotton port\r\nthat many owners would build vessels of unusually light draught, in\r\norder that they might make one trip a year to New Orleans with them,\r\nalthough the rest of the time they sailed to deeper ports. As soon as\r\nit became known over the shipping world that New Orleans was now open\r\nto deep-draught vessels, a great many new ones were built. Thus the\r\nJetties, as much as any other cause, brought in the era of great ships.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated from statistics, which it is not necessary to\r\ngive here, that the annual saving to producers of the Mississippi\r\nValley brought about by the fall of rates, the saving in marine\r\ninsurance, and the saving in time, due to the Jetties, is $5,000,000;\r\nand it is furthermore calculated that the annual money value of the\r\nJetties to the people of the country at large is, by a very\r\nconservative estimate, $25,000,000.\r\n\r\nEven the Jetties, however, were not the end of Eads's efforts toward\r\nthe improvement of the Mississippi. For several years before their\r\ncompletion he had been delivering addresses urging the application of\r\nthe same system to the entire alluvial basin of the river from the gulf\r\nto Cairo. People were in despair as to what to do to prevent the\r\nbreaking of the levees (the results of which are as \"terrible to the\r\ndwellers on those flats as the avalanche to people who live on the\r\nsides of steep mountains\"), and the distress and prostration created by\r\nthe awful spring floods. Most people thought there were two possible\r\nremedies,--to build more and higher levees, and to drain off some of\r\nthe volume of the river through the Louisiana bayous. But Eads insisted\r\nthat the requisite move was to reduce the excessive width of certain\r\nstretches of the river with willow mattresses; by uniformity of width\r\nto produce uniformity of depth, and consequently uniformity of current.\r\nThis would facilitate the discharge of floods, and would tend to lessen\r\nthe need of any levees, whereas drawing off any of the volume of water,\r\nhe said, would increase the elevation of its surface slope, and thus\r\nnecessitate higher levees.\r\n\r\nHis arguments on the question are clear and forcible; and it is likely\r\nthat his plan, if carried out, would solve the important question of\r\nthe Mississippi. But enough money to try it thoroughly has never been\r\nappropriated; and so little effect has patching had, that at this very\r\nday there are still advocates of the scheme of drawing off some of the\r\nwater,--a scheme which Eads blasted years ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 the Mississippi River Commission was created, consisting of one\r\ncivilian and six military and civil engineers, of whom Eads was one.\r\nBut for him the government would not have undertaken, at any rate at\r\nthat time, its very comprehensive system of river improvement, founded\r\nprimarily on his theory. Besides giving a regular, deepened channel,\r\nand putting an end to overflows, he contended that his system would\r\nreclaim about 30,000 square miles of rich alluvial lands subject to\r\ninundation. For two years he served on this commission: for many years\r\nbefore he had been working and fighting for the same grand\r\nresult,--grand though almost fruitless. \"He had no selfish interest to\r\nsubserve\" in this; \"no contract to execute; nothing himself to gain.\"\r\nBut when, on returning from a trip to Europe, he found that the work\r\nwas no longer being carried on as he thought it should be, he resigned\r\nfrom the commission. Deploring the wrong methods used, he still was\r\nmost deeply interested in this great work up to the time of his death.\r\nIf, some day, the Mississippi is conquered, it will doubtless be\r\nthrough the means he pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE SHIP-RAILWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Jetties were finished and paid for, Eads found himself in a\r\nvery good situation. Not only was his bold scheme proved to be a\r\ncomplete success, but it had in the end paid him well; and he was\r\npromised still further payment for maintaining his works twenty years\r\nlonger. His reputation was world-wide. He was now fifty-nine years old.\r\nFive years later, in 1884, he went to live in New York. It is not hard\r\nto imagine why so busy a man wished to be more in the centre of things,\r\nthough, for that matter, he had not for some years past spent much of\r\nhis time at home. There was too much to make him travel. Besides the\r\nfrequent voyages which he was ordered to take for the sake of his\r\nhealth,--and which, as he was a very bad sailor, he said were real\r\nmedicine,--he was in demand here and there, in places miles apart, for\r\nprofessional services; and then, too, he visited many engineering works\r\nin various remote lands,--river improvements, docks, the Suez Canal. It\r\nwas not alone that his curiosity was always healthy, but also that his\r\neducation--the broad, useful education that he gave himself--was never\r\nended.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how he refused to go to Brazil. He was also wanted at\r\nJacksonville, Florida, where the citizens called him in 1878 to examine\r\nthe mouth of the Saint John's River, and to report on the practicability\r\nof deepening the channel through the bar with jetties. He went there,\r\nand, after a personal examination, presented a very elaborate report.\r\nIn 1880 the governor of California had requested him to act as\r\nconsulting engineer of that State, and he accordingly visited the\r\nSacramento River, and reported upon the plans for the preservation of\r\nits channel and the arrest of débris from the mines. In 1881 he was\r\nconsulted by the Canadian Minister of Public Works on the improvement\r\nof the harbor of Toronto, which he also examined. This was the first\r\ninstance in which the Canadian government had ever employed an American\r\nengineer. When he was in Mexico, the government there asked him for\r\nreports on the harbors of Vera Cruz and Tampico and suggestions for\r\ntheir improvement. Although he did not examine these two harbors\r\npersonally, he drew up plans on surveys furnished by engineers whom he\r\nsent there; and the work which has since been carried out after his\r\ninstructions has proved eminently satisfactory. Again, it was the\r\npeople of Vicksburg who sent for him to tell them how to better their\r\nharbor; and at another time he was consulted about the Columbia River\r\nin Oregon and about Humboldt Bay. In 1885 the Brazilian Emperor made a\r\nsecond attempt to secure his services for an examination of the Rio\r\nGrande del Sul, but ill health and pressing business prevented his\r\nacceptance of the offer; nor was he able to undertake the examination\r\nof the harbor of Oporto requested by the Portuguese government. It\r\nseems superfluous to say that all the reports he did make \"were\r\nexhaustive and eminently instructive in their treatment of the subjects\r\ndiscussed.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the two most important professional cases submitted to him were\r\nthose in 1884 on the estuary and bar of the Mersey River and on\r\nGalveston Harbor. In the case of the Mersey he was called in, at the\r\nsolicitation of the Mersey Docks and Harbor Board of Liverpool, to\r\nsettle a dispute. Appearing before a committee of the House of Lords,\r\nhe gave his testimony as to the effect which the proposed terminal\r\nworks of the Manchester ship canal would have upon the estuary of the\r\nMersey and the bar at Liverpool. \"He brought to the solution of this\r\nquestion that same keen insight into hydraulics and the same close\r\napplication that had made him so successful in this country.\" He showed\r\nso plainly what would inevitably be the deleterious results of the\r\nproposed plans that the committee decided against them. Subsequently\r\nthey were changed to conform to his suggestions. For this report he\r\nreceived £3500, said to have been the largest fee ever paid to a\r\nconsulting engineer.\r\n\r\nIn the Galveston case, the same year, he was requested, not only by the\r\ncity but by the state legislature, to formulate a plan and to take a\r\ncontract from the United States government for improving that harbor.\r\nThe government had already been carrying on works there for several\r\nyears and accomplishing nothing. Indeed, it was the jetty method--by\r\nthis time more highly thought of than ten years before--which was being\r\nattempted, but not in proper form. Eads, after long and careful study\r\nof the situation, made a plan, which he offered to carry out on\r\nconditions very similar to those adopted in the case of the Mississippi\r\nJetties, but Congress was not willing to grant the contract. Since\r\nthen, however, the works there have been altered according to his\r\nsuggestions, and have consequently been more successful.\r\n\r\nFor a good many years, owing to the weakness of his lungs and to other\r\nillness, Eads had not only had to travel much for his health, but to\r\ntake special care of himself generally; and yet, to judge from the\r\nfollowing account, in the first person, of how he had spent the year\r\n1880, it seems that his wondrous energy had not failed: \"I inspected\r\nthe River Danube about 800 miles of its course; and investigated the\r\ncause and extent of the frightful inundation at Szegedin, in Hungary,\r\nwhich involved an examination of 150 miles of the Theiss River. I also\r\nexamined the Suez Canal, to familiarize myself more thoroughly with the\r\nquestion of a ship canal across the American isthmus, having previously\r\nvisited the Amsterdam ship canal and the one at the mouth of the River\r\nRhone. As a member of the Mississippi River Commission I also aided in\r\nperfecting the plans for the improvement of that river, and the\r\npreparation of its report now under consideration before Congress. As\r\nconsulting engineer of the State of California I made a thorough\r\ninspection of the Sacramento River, to consider the best method of\r\nrepairing the injury to its navigation caused by the hydraulic mining\r\noperations there, and submitted a lengthy report upon it. On my way\r\nback I visited the wonders of the Yellowstone Park, crossing the Rocky\r\nMountains in that excursion six different times. Within this time I\r\nhave thrice visited the Jetties at the mouth of the Mississippi,\r\nbesides my visit to the city of Mexico, Tehuantepec, and Yucatan.... I\r\nhave also, at the request of the mayor and council of Vicksburg, twice\r\nvisited that city during the last year, to examine its harbor with a\r\nview to its improvement.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Eads received perhaps the most distinguished honor of his\r\ncareer--the award of the Albert Medal. As it came only two or three\r\nmonths after the report on the Mersey, it was undoubtedly due to that\r\nas its immediate cause, although the Jetties were almost specifically\r\nnamed as the reason for this honor,--and Eads had not by any means\r\nlacked even earlier appreciation in England. Three years before, at a\r\nmeeting of the British Association, he had been urged, nay pressed, to\r\ndeliver an impromptu address on his works, both completed and\r\nprojected. Nevertheless, it was not until after the Mersey report that\r\nthe Albert Medal was conferred upon him. This medal, founded in 1862 in\r\nmemory of the Prince Consort, is awarded annually by the Society for\r\nthe Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. It was in Eads's\r\ncase awarded \"as a token of their appreciation of the services he had\r\nrendered to the science of engineering,\" to the engineer \"whose works\r\nhave been of such great service in improving the water communications\r\nof North America, and have thereby rendered valuable aid to the\r\ncommerce of the world.\" He was the second American citizen and the\r\nfirst native-born American to receive this medal.\r\n\r\nOf course he belonged to many scientific organizations. He was a member\r\nof the Engineers Club of Saint Louis, and for two years president of\r\nthe Academy of Science there; he was also a member of the American\r\nGeographical Society, of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Great\r\nBritain, and of the British Association, and of the Society for the\r\nEncouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce; a fellow of the\r\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science; and a member,\r\nfellow, and for a year vice-president of the American Society of Civil\r\nEngineers.\r\n\r\nHe was now a person whose return from Europe, with plans for river\r\nimprovement, and news about a fresh engineering scheme, was an item in\r\nthe small as well as the large newspapers. For, since the Jetties were\r\nfinished, he had a new scheme,--a decidedly new one it seemed to most\r\npeople,--though, as formerly, he made no pretense of having originated\r\nthe idea. Instead of resting content, now that he was almost\r\nsixty,--rich, and honored, and frail,--instead of resting content on\r\nhis laurels of the gunboats, the Bridge, the Jetties, he was as active\r\nas ever, with the hope of opening more roads to commerce and\r\nprosperity. The publication of the proceedings of De Lesseps's\r\nInteroceanic Canal Congress in 1879 gave Eads an opportunity to\r\npropose, in a letter to the New York \"Tribune,\" his own project for\r\nspanning the isthmus. The Tehuantepec route from the Gulf of Mexico to\r\nthe Pacific would be, in the general lines of travel, about 2000 miles\r\nshorter than the Panama route, or 1500 miles shorter than the\r\nNicaragua. And it was at Tehuantepec that Eads proposed building, not a\r\ncanal, but a ship-railway. The proposition was astounding. It certainly\r\nsuggested very picturesque visions of transportation; but at first\r\nsight it did not sound very practicable. However, Eads held that it\r\npresented six great and purely practical advantages: First, it could be\r\nbuilt for much less than the cost of a canal. Secondly, it could be\r\nbuilt in one quarter of the time. Thirdly, it could, with absolute\r\nsafety, transport ships more rapidly. Fourthly, its actual cost could\r\nbe more accurately foretold. Fifthly, the expense of maintaining it\r\nwould be less than for a canal. Sixthly, its capacity could be easily\r\nincreased to meet future requirements.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 he appeared before a committee of the House, and in reply to De\r\nLesseps, who was advocating the Panama Canal, he stated his plan for\r\nthe ship-railway. A few months later he went to Mexico, where the\r\ngovernment gave him, besides a very valuable concession for building\r\nthe ship-railway, its cordial assistance in his surveys. It was at this\r\ntime that Mexico requested his aid in improving its two harbors, and\r\nwhen he returned home, sent him in the Mexican man-of-war, the\r\nIndependencia. The next year he proposed to Congress to build the\r\nship-railway at his own risk, and to give the United States special\r\nprivileges, which had been arranged for in his Mexican charter,\r\nprovided the government would, as he proved the practicability of his\r\nplan by actual construction and operation, guarantee part of the\r\nship-railway's dividends. Although this arrangement would have laid as\r\nlittle risk on the government as the jetty arrangement had, it was not\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nStrange and even unnatural as the idea itself appeared, it was adapted\r\nfrom perfectly simple ship-railways already in existence and in\r\nsatisfactory use. Science, he said, could do anything, however\r\ntremendous, if it had enough money. In the magnified form contemplated,\r\nthe plan provided for a single track of a dozen parallel rails, and a\r\ncar with 1500 wheels. On this car was to be a huge cradle into which\r\nany ship might be floated and carefully propped. The car having then\r\nbeen hauled up a very slight incline out of the water, and monster,\r\ndouble-headed locomotives hitched to it, by gentle grades it and the\r\nship were to be drawn across to the other ocean a hundred miles away,\r\nwhere the ship could be floated again. To obviate any chance of\r\nstraining the ships, all curves were to be avoided by the use of\r\nturn-tables.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, many people believed that such a journey would strain a\r\nship so much that it would never float afterwards. On the other hand,\r\nthere is so imposing an array of names of distinguished engineers,\r\nshipbuilders, and seamen, who declared that the plan was feasible in\r\nevery particular, that it is hard to think they could all have been\r\nmistaken in thus supporting the leading engineer of the day. It may\r\neasily be supposed that every other imaginable and unimaginable\r\nobjection was raised, but to one and all Eads gave an answer that\r\nsounded conclusive.\r\n\r\nAs usual he was willing to back up his ideas with money, and he had the\r\nmost elaborate surveys made, and remarkable models prepared to show the\r\nworking of the ship-railway. He preached this new crusade of science\r\nwith his customary vigor. So many men were financially interested in\r\nthe project, or were ready to be, that it would at all events have been\r\ntested, had not its leading spirit, the very life of it, died.\r\n\r\nEven though he was at the same time engaged in investigations so\r\nimportant as those at the Mersey and at Galveston, Eads devoted the\r\nlast six years of his life mainly to this daring and tremendous\r\nenterprise. In 1885, after obtaining from the Mexican government a\r\nmodification of his concession, guaranteeing one third of the net\r\nrevenue per annum, he had a bill introduced in Congress, whereby, when\r\nthe ship-railway should be entirely finished and in operation, the\r\nUnited States was to guarantee the other two thirds. Though this bill\r\nwas favorably reported, Eads finally decided to withdraw it, and to ask\r\nafter all for a simple charter, which would doubtless have been\r\ngranted. During those six years there was perhaps not another man in\r\nthe country who was so able to persuade others of the scientific,\r\nfinancial, commercial soundness of his projects. If, more than any one\r\nelse, he could make a scheme appeal, it was not that it was in any\r\nsinister sense a scheme, but because his tact and his address were\r\npleasing, his reputation firmly grounded for honesty and common-sense\r\nas well as for thorough scientific knowledge, so that his enthusiasm\r\nwas contagious. His enemies might call him a lobbyist, but his sole\r\nmeans of persuasion were the soundness of his views, the clearness of\r\nhis arguments, and the fervor of his wish to benefit his country.\r\n\r\nFor this undertaking, as for his previous ones, Eads invented many\r\ndevices. All in all he held nearly fifty patents from the United States\r\nand England for useful inventions in naval warfare, bridge foundations\r\nand superstructure, dredging machines, navigation, river and harbor\r\nworks, and ship-railway construction.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1887, when his bill was to come up, he went to Washington.\r\nHe was in such poor health that he was not able to remain there, but on\r\nhis doctor's advice he went with his wife and one daughter to Nassau.\r\nWhile sick there, he was still at work on improvements for his\r\nship-railway. He was wont to say to his intimate friends, \"I shall not\r\ndie until I accomplish this work, and see with my own eyes great ships\r\npass from ocean to ocean over the land.\" But in Nassau it was soon\r\nknown that he was dying; and still he said, \"I cannot die; I have not\r\nfinished my work.\"\r\n\r\nHe died March 8, 1887, not quite sixty-seven years of age. No one has\r\nfinished his work.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIn any career there are three main elements of success: talent,\r\neducation, work. Eads's life, like that of so many other self-made men,\r\nseems to show us that education is less important than the other two.\r\nBut while it is true that he had not the formal education of an\r\nengineer, he had a certain very broad training gained in experience,\r\nand had read hard. Education, after all, is nothing but a summary\r\nmethod of teaching the lessons of life; therefore, while less\r\ninsistent, it is often swifter than practical experience. And there is\r\nno doubt that a man like Eads would be the first to deplore a young\r\nman's failing to appreciate its value. When he himself was young, he\r\nnever supposed that he was a genius; but if he had thought this, he\r\nwould have striven to be the best-read and the best-equipped of\r\ngeniuses; believing that though he might be mistaken about his talent\r\nhe could make sure of his culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Press\r\n\r\n_Electrotyped and printed by H.
