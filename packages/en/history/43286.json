Since that date the author has collected a vast amount of\r\nadditional material on the subject, which has also been discussed by other\r\nwriters in several publications, the most noteworthy of which are\r\nProfessor Karl von Amira’s _Thierstrafen und Thierprocesse_ (Innsbruck,\r\n1891), Carlo d’Addosio’s _Bestie Delinquenti_ (Napoli, 1892), and G.\r\nTobler’s _Thierprocesse in der Schweiz_ (Bern, 1893), but in none of these\r\nworks, except the first-mentioned, are there any important statements of\r\nfacts or citations of cases in addition to those adduced in the essays\r\nalready mentioned, for which the writer was indebted chiefly to the\r\nextensive and exceedingly valuable researches of Berriat-Saint-Prix and M.\r\nL. Ménebréa, and the _Consilium Primum_ of Bartholomew Chassenée, cited in\r\nthe appended bibliography. Professor Von Amira is a very distinguished and\r\nremarkably keen-sighted jurisprudent and treats the matter exclusively\r\nfrom a jurisprudential point of view, his main object being to discover\r\nsome general principle on which to explain these strange phenomena, and\r\nthus to assign to them their proper place and true significance in the\r\nhistorical evolution of the idea of justice and the methods of attaining\r\nit by legal procedure.\r\n\r\nVon Amira draws a sharp line of technical distinction between Thierstrafen\r\nand Thierprocesse; the former were capital punishments inflicted by\r\nsecular tribunals upon pigs, cows, horses, and other domestic animals as a\r\npenalty for homicide; the latter were judicial proceedings instituted by\r\necclesiastical courts against rats, mice, locusts, weevils, and other\r\nvermin in order to prevent them from devouring the crops, and to expel\r\nthem from orchards, vineyards, and cultivated fields by means of exorcism\r\nand excommunication. Animals, which were in the service of man, could be\r\narrested, tried, convicted and executed, like any other members of his\r\nhousehold; it was, therefore, not necessary to summon them to appear in\r\ncourt at a specified time to answer for their conduct, and thus make\r\nthem, in the strict sense of the term, a party to the prosecution, for\r\nthe sheriff had already taken them in charge and consigned them to the\r\ncustody of the jailer. Insects and rodents, on the other hand, which were\r\nnot subject to human control and could not be seized and imprisoned by the\r\ncivil authorities, demanded the intervention of the Church and the\r\nexercise of its supernatural functions for the purpose of compelling them\r\nto desist from their devastations and to retire from all places devoted to\r\nthe production of human sustenance. The only feasible method of staying\r\nthe ravages of these swarms of noxious creatures was to resort to\r\n“metaphysical aid” and to expel or exterminate them by sacerdotal\r\nconjuring and cursing. The fact that it was customary to catch several\r\nspecimens of the culprits and bring them before the seat of justice, and\r\nthere solemnly put them to death while the anathema was being pronounced,\r\nproves that this summary manner of dealing would have been applied to the\r\nwhole of them, had it been possible to do so. Indeed, the attempt was\r\nsometimes made to get rid of them by setting a price on their heads, as\r\nwas the case with the plague of locusts at Rome in 880, when a reward was\r\noffered for their extermination, but all efforts in this direction proving\r\nfutile, on account of the rapidity with which they propagated, recourse\r\nwas had to exorcisms and be-sprinklings with holy water.\r\n\r\nD’Addosio speaks of the actions brought against domestic animals for\r\nhomicide as penal prosecutions, and those instituted against insects and\r\nvermin for injury done to the fruits of the field as civil suits\r\n(_processi civili_); but the latter designation is not correct in any\r\nproper sense of the term, since these actions were not suits to recover\r\nfor damages to property, but had solely a preventive or prohibitive\r\ncharacter. The judicial process was preliminary to the utterance of the\r\nmalediction and essential to its efficacy. Before fulminating an\r\nexcommunication the whole machinery of justice was put in motion in order\r\nto establish the guilt of the accused, who were then warned, admonished,\r\nand threatened, and, in cases of obduracy, smitten with the _anathema\r\nmaranatha_ and devoted to utter destruction. As with all bans, charms,\r\nexorcisms, incantations, and other magical hocus-pocus, the omission of\r\nany formality would vitiate the whole procedure, and, by breaking the\r\nspell, deprive the imprecation or interdiction of its occult virtue.\r\nEcclesiastical thunder would thus be robbed of its fatal bolt and reduced\r\nto mere empty noise, the harmless explosion of a blank cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe Church was not wholly consistent in its explanations of these\r\nphenomena. In general the swarms of devouring insects and other noxious\r\nvermin are assumed to have been sent at the instigation of Satan\r\n(_instigante sathana, per maleficium diabolicum_), and are denounced and\r\ndeprecated as snares of the devil and his satellites (_diaboli et\r\nministrorum insidias_); again they are treated as creatures of God and\r\nagents of the Almighty for the punishment of sinful man; from this latter\r\npoint of view every effort to exterminate them by natural means would be\r\nregarded as a sort of sacrilege, an impious attempt to war upon the\r\nSupreme Being and to withstand His designs. In either case, whether they\r\nwere the emissaries of a wicked demon or of a wrathful Deity, the only\r\nproper and permissible way of relief was through the offices of the\r\nChurch, whose bishops and other clergy were empowered to perform the\r\nadjurations and maledictions or to prescribe the penances and\r\npropitiations necessary to produce this result. If the insects were\r\ninstruments of the devil, they might be driven into the sea or banished to\r\nsome arid region, where they would all miserably perish; if, on the other\r\nhand, they were recognized as the ministers of God, divinely delegated to\r\nscourge mankind for the promotion of piety, it would be suitable, after\r\nthey had fulfilled their mission, to cause them to withdraw from the\r\ncultivated fields and to assign them a spot, where they might live in\r\ncomfort without injury to the inhabitants. The records contain instances\r\nof both kinds of treatment.\r\n\r\nIt was also as a protection against evil spirits that the penalty of death\r\nwas inflicted upon domestic animals. A homicidal pig or bull was not\r\nnecessarily assumed to be the incarnation of a demon, although it was\r\nmaintained by eminent authorities, as we have shown in the present work,\r\nthat all beasts and birds, as well as creeping things, were devils in\r\ndisguise; but the homicide, if it were permitted to go unpunished, was\r\nsupposed to furnish occasion for the intervention of devils, who were\r\nthereby enabled to take possession of both persons and places. This belief\r\nwas prevalent in the Middle Ages, and is still taught by the Catholic\r\nChurch. In a little volume entitled _Die Verwaltung des Exorcistats nach\r\nMassgabe der römischen Benediktionale_, of which a revised and enlarged\r\nedition was published at Stuttgart in 1893 for the use of priests as a\r\nmanual of instruction in performing exorcisms, it is expressly stated by\r\nthe reverend author, Dr. Theobald Bischofberger, that a spot, where a\r\nmurder or other heinous crime has been committed, if the said crime\r\nremains undetected or unexpiated, is sure to be infested by demons, and\r\nthat the inmates of a house or other building erected upon such a site\r\nwill be peculiarly liable to diabolical possession, however innocent they\r\nmay be personally. Indeed, the more pure and pious they are, the greater\r\nwill be the efforts of the demons to enter into and annoy them. Not only\r\nhuman beings, but also all cattle after their kind, and even the fowls of\r\nthe barnyard are subject to infernal vexations of this sort. The\r\ninfestation thus produced may continue for centuries, and, although the\r\nproperty may pass by purchase or inheritance into other hands and be held\r\nsuccessively by any number of rightful owners, the demons remain in\r\npossession unaffected by legal conveyances. If each proprietor imagines he\r\nhas an exclusive title to the estate, he reckons without the host of\r\ndevils, who exercise there the right of squatter sovereignty and can be\r\nexpelled only by sacerdotal authority. Dr. Bischofberger goes so far as to\r\naffirm that it behoves the purchaser of a piece of land to make sure that\r\nit is unencumbered by devils as well as by debts, otherwise he may have to\r\nsuffer more from a demoniac lien than from a dead pledge or any other form\r\nof obligation in law. Information concerning the latter can be obtained at\r\nthe registry of deeds, but it is far more difficult to ascertain whether\r\nthe infernal powers have any claims upon it, since this knowledge can be\r\nderived only inferentially and indirectly from inquiries into the\r\ncharacter of the proprietors for many generations and must always rest\r\nupon presumptive evidence rather than positive proof. Our author does not\r\nhesitate to assert that houses which have been the abodes of pious people\r\nfrom time immemorial ought to have a higher market value than the\r\nhabitations of notoriously wicked families. It is thus shown that\r\n“godliness is profitable” not only “unto all things,” but also, as\r\nmediæval writers were wont to say, unto some things besides, which the\r\napostle Paul in his admonitions to his “son Timothy” never dreamed of. We\r\nare also told that the _aura corrumpens_ resulting from diabolical\r\ninfestation imparts to the dwelling a peculiar taint, which it often\r\nretains for a long time after the demons have been cast out, so that\r\nsensitive persons cannot enter such a domicile without getting nervously\r\nexcited, slightly dizzy and all in a tremble. The carnal mind, which is at\r\nenmity with all supernatural explanations of natural phenomena, would seek\r\nthe source of such sensations in an _aura corrumpens_ arising from the\r\nlack of proper ventilation, and find relief by simply opening the windows\r\ninstead of calling in a priest with aspergills, and censers, and\r\n_benedictiones locorum_.\r\n\r\nWe have a striking illustration of this truth in the frequent cases of\r\n“bewitched kine.” European peasants often confine their cattle in stalls\r\nso small and low that the beasts have not sufficient air to breathe. The\r\nresult is that a short time after the stalls are closed for the night the\r\ncattle get excited and begin to fret and fume and stamp, and are found in\r\nthe morning weak and exhausted and covered with sweat. The peasant\r\nattributes these phenomena to witchcraft, and calls in an exorcist, who\r\nproceeds to expel the evil spirits. Before performing the ceremony of\r\nconjuration, he opens the doors and windows and the admission of fresh\r\nair makes it quite easy to cast out the demons. A German veterinarian, who\r\nreports several instances of this kind, tried in vain to convince the\r\npeasants that the trouble was due, not to sorcery, but to the absence of\r\nproper sanatory conditions, and finally, in despair of accomplishing his\r\npurpose in any other way, told them that if the windows were left open so\r\nthat the witches could go in and out freely, the demons would not enter\r\ninto the cattle. This advice was followed and the malign influence ceased.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks held that a murder, whether committed by a man, a\r\nbeast, or an inanimate object, unless properly expiated, would arouse the\r\nfuries and bring pestilence upon the land; the mediæval Church taught the\r\nsame doctrine, and only substituted the demons of Christian theology for\r\nthe furies of classical mythology. As early as 864, the Council of Worms\r\ndecreed that bees, which had caused the death of a human being by stinging\r\nhim, should be forthwith suffocated in the hive before they could make any\r\nmore honey, otherwise the entire contents of the hive would become\r\ndemoniacally tainted and thus rendered unfit for use as food; it was\r\ndeclared to be unclean, and this declaration of impurity implied a\r\nliability to diabolical possession on the part of those who, like Achan,\r\n“transgressed in the thing accursed.” It was the same horror of aiding\r\nand abetting demons and enabling them to extend their power over mankind\r\nthat caused a cock, which was suspected of having laid the so-called\r\n“basilisk-egg,” or a hen, addicted to the ominous habit of crowing, to be\r\nsummarily put to death, since it was only by such expiation that the evil\r\ncould be averted.\r\n\r\nA Swiss jurist, Eduard Osenbrüggen (_Studien zur deutschen und\r\nschweizerischen Rechtsgeschichte._ Schaffhausen, 1868, p. 139-149),\r\nendeavours to explain these judicial proceedings on the theory of the\r\npersonification of animals. As only a human being can commit crime and\r\nthus render himself liable to punishment, he concludes that it is only by\r\nan act of personification that the brute can be placed in the same\r\ncategory as man and become subject to the same penalties. In support of\r\nthis view he refers to the fact that in ancient and mediæval times\r\ndomestic animals were regarded as members of the household and entitled to\r\nthe same legal protection as human vassals. In the Frankish capitularies\r\nall beasts of burden or so-called juments were included in the king’s ban\r\nand enjoyed the peace guaranteed by royal authority: _Ut jumenta pacem\r\nhabent similiter per bannum regis_. The weregild extended to them as it\r\ndid to women and serfs under cover of the man as master of the house and\r\nlord of the manor. The beste covert, to use the old legal phraseology, was\r\nthus invested with human rights and inferentially endowed with human\r\nresponsibilities. According to old Welsh law atonement was made for\r\nkilling a cat or dog belonging to another person by suspending the animal\r\nby the tail so that its nozzle touched the ground, and then pouring wheat\r\nover it until its body was entirely covered. Old Germanic law also\r\nrecognized the competency of these animals as witnesses in certain cases,\r\nas, for example, when burglary had been committed by night, in the absence\r\nof human testimony, the householder was permitted to appear before the\r\ncourt and make complaint, carrying on his arm a dog, cat or cock, and\r\nholding in his hand three straws taken from the roof as symbols of the\r\nhouse. Symbolism and personification, as applied to animals and inanimate\r\nobjects, unquestionably played an important part in primitive legislation,\r\nbut this principle does not account for the excommunication and\r\nanathematization of noxious vermin or for the criminal prosecution and\r\ncapital punishment of homicidal beasts, nor does it throw the faintest\r\nlight upon the origin and purpose of such proceedings. Osenbrüggen’s\r\nstatement that the cock condemned to be burned at Bâle was personified as\r\na heretic (Ketzer) and therefore sentenced to the stake, is a far-fetched\r\nand wholly fanciful explanation. As we have already seen, the unfortunate\r\nfowl, suspected of laying an egg in violation of its nature, was feared as\r\nan abnormal, inauspicious, and therefore diabolic creature; the fatal\r\ncockatrice, which was supposed to issue from this egg when hatched, and\r\nthe use which might be made of its contents for promoting intercourse with\r\nevil spirits, caused such a cock to be dreaded as a dangerous purveyor to\r\nHis Satanic Majesty, but no member of the Kohlenberg Court ever thought of\r\nconsigning Chanticleer to the flames as the peer of Wycliffe or of Huss in\r\nheresy.\r\n\r\nThe judicial prosecution of animals, resulting in their excommunication by\r\nthe Church or their execution by the hangman, had its origin in the common\r\nsuperstition of the age, which has left such a tragical record of itself\r\nin the incredibly absurd and atrocious annals of witchcraft. The same\r\nancient code that condemned a homicidal ox to be stoned, declared that a\r\nwitch should not be suffered to live, and although the Jewish lawgiver may\r\nhave regarded the former enactment chiefly as a police regulation designed\r\nto protect persons against unruly cattle, it was, like the decree of death\r\nagainst witches, genetically connected with the Hebrew cult and had\r\ntherefore an essentially religious character. It was these two paragraphs\r\nof the Mosaic law that Christian tribunals in the Middle Ages were wont to\r\nadduce as their authority for prosecuting and punishing both classes of\r\ndelinquents, although in the application of them they were undoubtedly\r\nincited by motives and influenced by fears wholly foreign to the mind of\r\nthe Levitical legislator. The extension of Christianity beyond the\r\nboundaries of Judaism and the conversion of Gentile nations led to its\r\ngradual but radical transformation. The propagation of the new and\r\naggressive faith among the Greeks and Romans, and especially among the\r\nIndo-Germanic tribes of Northern Europe, necessarily deposed, degraded and\r\ndemonized the ancestral deities of the proselytes, who were taught\r\nhenceforth to abjure the gods of their fathers and to denounce them as\r\ndevils. Thus missionary zeal and success, while saving human souls from\r\nendless perdition, served also to enlarge the realm of the Prince of\r\nDarkness and to increase the number of his subjects and satellites. The\r\nnew convert saw them with his mind’s eye skulking about in obscure places,\r\nhaunting forest dells and mountain streams by day, approaching human\r\nhabitations by night and waiting for opportunities to lure him back to the\r\nold worship or to take vengeance upon him for his recreancy. Every\r\nuntoward event furnished an occasion for their intervention, which could\r\nbe averted or repelled only by the benedictions, exorcisms or anathemas of\r\nthe Church. The ecclesiastical authorities were therefore directly\r\ninterested in encouraging this superstitious belief as one of the chief\r\nsources of their power, and it was for this reason that diabolical\r\nagencies were assumed to be at work in every maleficent force of nature\r\nand to be incarnate in every noxious creature. That this doctrine is\r\nstill held and this policy still pursued by the bishops and other clergy\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church, no one familiar with the literature of the\r\nsubject can deny.\r\n\r\nBesides the manuals and rituals already cited, consult, for example, _Die\r\ndeutschen Bischöfe und der Aberglaube_: Eine Denkschrift von Dr. Fr.\r\nHeinrich Reusch, Professor of Theology in the University of Bonn, who\r\nvigorously protests against the countenance given by the bishops to the\r\ncrassest superstitions. For specimens of the literature condemned by the\r\nGerman professor, but approved by the prelates and the pope, see such\r\nperiodicals as _Monat-Rosen zu Ehren der Unbefleckten Gottes-Mutter Maria\r\nand Der Sendbote des göttlichen Herzens Jesu_, published by Jesuits at\r\nInnsbruck in the Tyrol.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the most recent and most radical theories of\r\njuridical punishment, based upon anthropological, sociological and\r\npsychiatrical investigations, would seem to obscure and even to obliterate\r\nthe line of distinction between man and beast, so far as their capacity\r\nfor committing crime and their moral responsibility for their misdeeds are\r\nconcerned. According to Lombroso there are _i delinquenti nati fra gli\r\nanimali_, beasts which are born criminals and wilfully and wantonly injure\r\nothers of their kind, violating with perversity and premeditation the laws\r\nof the society in which they live. Thus the modern criminologist\r\nrecognizes the existence of the kind of malefactor characterized by\r\nJocodus Damhouder, a Belgian jurist of the sixteenth century, as _bestia\r\nlaedens ex interna malitia_; but although he might admit that the beast\r\nperpetrated the deed with malice aforethought and with the clear\r\nconsciousness of wrong-doing, he would never think of bringing such a\r\ncreature to trial or of applying to it the principle of retributive\r\njustice. This example illustrates the radical change which the theory of\r\npunishment has undergone in recent times and the far-reaching influence\r\nwhich it is beginning to exert upon penal legislation. In the second part\r\nof the present work the writer calls attention to this important\r\nrevolution in the province of criminology, discussing as concisely as\r\npossible its essential features and indicating its general scope and\r\npractical tendencies, so far as they have been determined. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that, although the savage spirit of revenge, that\r\neagerly demands blood for blood without the slightest consideration of the\r\nanatomical, physiological or psychological conditions upon which the\r\ncommission of the specific act depends, has ceased to be the controlling\r\nfactor in the enactment and execution of penal codes, the new system of\r\njurisprudence, based upon more enlightened conceptions of human\r\nresponsibility, is still in an inchoate state and very far from having\r\nworked out a satisfactory solution of the intricate problem of the origin\r\nand nature of crime and its proper penalty.\r\n\r\nIn 1386, an infanticidal sow was executed in the old Norman city of\r\nFalaise, and the scene was represented in fresco on the west wall of the\r\nChurch of the Holy Trinity in that city. This curious painting no longer\r\nexists, and, so far as can be ascertained, has never been engraved. It has\r\nbeen frequently and quite fully described by different writers, and the\r\nfrontispiece of the present volume is not a reproduction of the original\r\npicture, but a reconstruction of it according to these descriptions. It is\r\ntaken from Arthur Mangin’s _L’Homme et la Bête_ (Paris, 1872), of which\r\nall the illustrations are more or less fancy sketches. A full account of\r\nthe trial and execution is given in the present volume.\r\n\r\nThe iconographic edition of Jocodus Damhouder’s _Praxis Rerum Criminalium_\r\n(Antverpiæ, 1562) contains at the beginning of each section an engraving\r\nrepresenting the perpetration of the crimes about to be discussed. That at\r\nthe head of the chapter entitled “De Damno Pecuario” is a lively picture\r\nof the injuries done by animals and rendering them liable to criminal\r\nprocess; it is reproduced facing page 161 of the present work.\r\n\r\nThe most important documents, from which our knowledge of these judicial\r\nproceedings is derived, are given in the Appendix, together with a\r\ncomplete list of prosecutions and excommunications during the past ten\r\ncenturies, so far as we have been able to discover any record of them.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography, although making no claim to be exhaustive, comprises the\r\nprincipal works on the subject. Articles and essays, which are merely a\r\nrehash of other publications, it has not been deemed necessary to mention.\r\nSuch, for example, are “Criminalprocesse gegen Thiere,” in _Miscellen aus\r\nder neuesten ausländischen Literatur_ (Jena, 1830, LXV. pp. 152-55),\r\nJörgensen’s _Nogle Frugter af mit Otium_ (Kopenhagen, 1834, pp. 216-23);\r\nCretella’s “Gli Animali sotto Processo,” in _Fanfulla della Domenica_\r\n(Florence, 1891, No. 65), all three based upon the archival researches of\r\nBerriat-Saint-Prix and Ménabréa, and Soldan’s “La Personification des\r\nAnimaux in Helvetia,” in _Monatsschrift der Studentenverbindung Helvetia_\r\n(VII. pp. 4-17), which is a mere restatement of Osenbrüggen’s theory.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the author desires to express his sincere thanks to Dr.\r\nLaubmann, Director of the Munich Hof- und Staatsbibliothek, as well as to\r\nthe other custodians of that library, for their uniform kindness and\r\ncourtesy in placing at his disposal the printed and manuscript treasures\r\ncommitted to their keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBUGS AND BEASTS BEFORE THE LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that Bartholomew Chassenée,[1] a distinguished French jurist of\r\nthe sixteenth century (born at Issy-l’Evêque in 1480), made his reputation\r\nat the bar as counsel for some rats, which had been put on trial before\r\nthe ecclesiastical court of Autun on the charge of having feloniously\r\neaten up and wantonly destroyed the barley-crop of that province. On\r\ncomplaint formally presented by the magistracy, the official or bishop’s\r\nvicar, who exercised jurisdiction in such cases, cited the culprits to\r\nappear on a certain day and appointed Chassenée to defend them.\r\n\r\nIn view of the bad repute and notorious guilt of his clients, Chassenée\r\nwas forced to employ all sorts of legal shifts and chicane, dilatory pleas\r\nand other technical objections, hoping thereby to find some loophole in\r\nthe meshes of the law through which the accused might escape, or at least\r\nto defer and mitigate the sentence of the judge. He urged, in the first\r\nplace, that inasmuch as the defendants were dispersed over a large tract\r\nof country and dwelt in numerous villages, a single summons was\r\ninsufficient to notify them all; he succeeded, therefore, in obtaining a\r\nsecond citation, to be published from the pulpits of all the parishes\r\ninhabited by the said rats. At the expiration of the considerable time\r\nwhich elapsed before this order could be carried into effect and the\r\nproclamation be duly made, he excused the default or non-appearance of his\r\nclients on the ground of the length and difficulty of the journey and the\r\nserious perils which attended it, owing to the unwearied vigilance of\r\ntheir mortal enemies, the cats, who watched all their movements, and, with\r\nfell intent, lay in wait for them at every corner and passage. On this\r\npoint Chassenée addressed the court at some length, in order to show that\r\nif a person be cited to appear at a place, to which he cannot come with\r\nsafety, he may exercise the right of appeal and refuse to obey the writ,\r\neven though such appeal be expressly precluded in the summons. The point\r\nwas argued as seriously as though it were a question of family feud\r\nbetween Capulet and Montague in Verona or Colonna and Orsini in Rome.\r\n\r\nAt a later period of his life Chassenée was reminded of the legal\r\nprinciple thus laid down and urged to apply it in favour of clients more\r\nworthy of its protection than a horde of vagrant rodents. In 1540 he was\r\npresident of the judicial assembly known as the Parliament of Provence on\r\na memorable occasion when the iniquitous measure for the extirpation of\r\nheresy by exterminating the Waldenses in the villages of Cabrières and\r\nMerindol was under discussion. One of the members of the tribunal, a\r\ngentleman from Arles, Renaud d’Alleins, ventured to suggest to the\r\npresiding officer that it would be extremely unjust to condemn these\r\nunfortunate heretics without granting them a hearing and permitting an\r\nadvocate to speak in their defence, so that they might be surrounded by\r\nall the safeguards of justice, adding that the eminent jurist had formerly\r\ninsisted upon this right before the court of Autun and maintained that\r\neven animals should not be adjudged and sentenced without having a proper\r\nperson appointed to plead their cause. Chassenée thereupon obtained a\r\ndecree from the king commanding that the accused Waldenses should be\r\nheard; but his death, which occurred very soon afterwards, changed the\r\nstate of affairs and prevented whatever good effects might have been\r\nproduced by this simple act of justice. [Cf. Desnoyers: _Recherches_, etc.\r\n(_vide_ Bibliography), p. 18.]\r\n\r\nIn the report of the trial published in the _Thémis Jurisconsulte_ for\r\n1820 (Tome I. pp. 194 sqq.) by Berriat Saint-Prix, on the authority of the\r\ncelebrated Jacques Auguste De Thou, President of the Parliament of Paris,\r\nthe sentence pronounced by the official is not recorded. But whatever the\r\njudicial decision may have been, the ingenuity and acumen with which\r\nChassenée conducted the defence, the legal learning which he brought to\r\nbear upon the case, and the eloquence of his plea enlisted the public\r\ninterest and established his fame as a criminal lawyer and forensic\r\norator.\r\n\r\nChassenée is said to have been employed in several cases of this kind, but\r\nno records of them seem to have been preserved, although it is possible\r\nthat they may lie buried in the dusty archives of some obscure provincial\r\ntown in France, once the seat of an ecclesiastical tribunal. The whole\r\nsubject, however, has been treated by him exhaustively in a book entitled\r\n_Consilium primum, quod tractatus jure dici potest, propter multiplicem et\r\nreconditam doctrinam, ubi luculenter et accurate tractatur quaestio illa:\r\nDe excommunicatione animalium insectorum_. This treatise, which is the\r\nfirst of sixty-nine consilia, embodying opinions on various legal\r\nquestions touching the holding and transmission of property, entail,\r\nloans, contracts, dowries, wills, and kindred topics, and which holds a\r\npeculiar place in the history of jurisprudence, was originally published\r\nin 1531, and reprinted in 1581, and again in 1588. The edition referred to\r\nin the present work is the first reprint of 1581, a copy of which is in\r\nthe Royal Court and State Library of Munich.\r\n\r\nThis curious dissertation originated, as it appears, in an application of\r\nthe inhabitants of Beaune to the ecclesiastical tribunal of Autun for a\r\ndecree of excommunication against certain noxious insects called huberes\r\nor hurebers, probably a kind of locust or harvest-fly. The request was\r\ngranted, and the pernicious creatures were duly accursed. Chassenée now\r\nraises the query whether such a thing may be rightfully and lawfully done\r\n(_sed an recte et de jure fieri possit_), and how it should be effected.\r\n“The principal question,” he says, “is whether one can by injunction cause\r\nsuch insects to withdraw from a place in which they are doing damage, or\r\nto abstain from doing damage there, under penalty of anathema and\r\nperpetual malediction. And although in times past there has never been any\r\ndoubt on this point, yet I have thought that the subject should be\r\nthoroughly examined anew, lest I should seem to fall into the vice\r\ncensured by Cicero (_De Off._ I. 6), of regarding things which we do not\r\nknow as if they were well understood by us, and therefore rashly giving\r\nthem our assent.” He divides his treatise into five parts, or rather\r\ndiscusses the subject under five heads: “First, lest I may seem to\r\ndiscourse to the populace, how are these our animals called in the Latin\r\nlanguage; secondly, whether these our animals can be summoned; thirdly,\r\nwhether they can be summoned by procurators, and, if they are cited to\r\nappear personally, whether they can appear by proxy, _i.e._ through\r\nprocurators appointed by the judge who summons them; fourthly, what\r\njudge, whether layman or ecclesiastic, is competent to try them, and how\r\nhe is to proceed against them and to pass and execute sentence upon them;\r\nfifthly, what constitutes an anathema and how does it differ from an\r\nexcommunication.” Chassenée’s method of investigation is not that of the\r\nphilosophic thinker, who marshals facts under general laws and traces them\r\nto rational causes, but combines that of the lawyer, who quotes precedents\r\nand examines witnesses, with that of the theologian, who balances\r\nauthorities and serves us with texts instead of arguments. He scrupulously\r\navoids all psychological speculation or metaphysical reasoning, and simply\r\naims to show that animals have been tried, convicted, and sentenced by\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical courts, and that the competence of these\r\ntribunals has been generally recognized.\r\n\r\nThe documentary evidence adduced is drawn from a great variety of sources:\r\nthe scriptures of the Old and New Testament, pagan poets and philosophers,\r\npatristic theologians and homilists, mediæval hagiologists, Virgil, Ovid,\r\nPliny, Cicero, Cato, Aristotle, Seneca, Silius Italicus, Boethius, Gregory\r\nthe Great, Pico della Mirandola, the laws of Moses, the prophecies of\r\nDaniel, and the Institutes of Justinian are alike laid under contribution\r\nand quoted as of equal authority. All is fish that comes to his net out\r\nof his erudition, be it salmon or sea-urchin. If twelve witnesses can be\r\nproduced in favour of a statement, and only two against it, his reason\r\nbows to the will of the majority, and accepts the proposition as proved.\r\nIt must be added, however, to his credit, that he proceeds in this matter\r\nwith strict impartiality and perfect rectitude, takes whatever evidence is\r\nat hand, and never tries to pack the witness-box.\r\n\r\nHis knowledge of obscure and now utterly forgotten authors, secular and\r\necclesiastic, is immense. Like so many scholars of his day he was\r\nprodigiously learned, without being remarkable for clearness or\r\noriginality of thought. Indeed, the vastness of his erudition seems rather\r\nto have hampered than helped the vigorous growth of his intellectual\r\nfaculties. He often indulges in logical subtilties so shallow in their\r\nspeciousness, that they ought not to deceive the veriest smatterer in\r\ndialectics; and the reader is constantly tempted to answer his laboured\r\nargumentations, as Tristram Shandy’s Uncle Toby did the lucubrations of\r\nCorporal Trim, by “whistling half-a-dozen bars of Lillibullero.” The\r\nexamples he adduces afford striking illustrations of the gross credulity\r\nto which the strongly conservative, precedent-mongering mind of the\r\njurisconsult is apt to fall an easy prey. The habit of seeking knowledge\r\nand guidance exclusively in the records and traditions of the past, in the\r\nso-called “wisdom of ages,” renders him peculiarly liable to regard every\r\nact and utterance of antiquity as necessarily wise and authoritative.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the power of anathemas, Chassenée refers to the cursing of the\r\nserpent in the Garden of Eden, causing it to go upon its belly for all\r\ntime; David’s malediction of the mountains of Gilboa, so that they had\r\nneither rain nor dew; God’s curse upon the city of Jericho, making its\r\nstrong walls fall before the blasts of trumpets; and in the New Testament\r\nthe withered fig-tree of Bethany. The words of Jesus, “Every tree that\r\nbringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire,” he\r\ninterprets, not merely as the best means of getting rid of a cumberer of\r\nthe orchard, but as a condemnation and punishment of the tree for its\r\ndelinquencies, and adds: “If, therefore, it is permitted to destroy an\r\nirrational thing, because it does not produce fruit, much more is it\r\npermitted to curse it, since the greater penalty includes the less” (_cum\r\nsi liceat quid est plus, debet licere quid est minus_).\r\n\r\nAn English professor of divinity, Richard Chevenix Trench, justifies the\r\nwithering of the fruitless fig-tree on the same ground or, at least, by a\r\nsimilar process of reasoning: “It was punished, not for being without\r\nfruit, but for proclaiming by the voice of those leaves that it had such;\r\nnot for being barren, but for being false.” According to this exegesis, it\r\nwas the telling of a wilful lie that “drew on it the curse.” The guilty\r\nfig is thus endowed with a moral character and made clearly conscious of\r\nthe crime for which it suffered the penalty of death: “Almost as soon as\r\nthe word of the Lord was spoken, a shuddering fear may have run through\r\nall the leaves of the tree, which was thus stricken at the heart.” As\r\nregards the culpability and punishableness of the object, the modern\r\ndivine and the mediæval jurist occupy the same standpoint; only the\r\nlatter, with a stricter judicial sense, insists that there shall be no\r\ninfliction of punishment until the malefactor has been convicted by due\r\nprocess of law, and that he shall enjoy all the safeguards which legal\r\nforms and technicalities have thrown around him and under whose covert\r\neven the vilest criminal has the right to take refuge. The Anglican\r\nhermeneutist, on the contrary, would justify the curse and admit the\r\nvalidity of the anathema, although it was only the angry expression of an\r\nunreasonable impatience disappointed in not finding fruit at the wrong\r\nseason, “for the time of figs was not yet.”\r\n\r\nA curious and characteristic specimen of the absurd and illogical\r\ninferences, which Chassenée is constantly deducing from his texts, is the\r\nuse he makes of the passage in Virgil’s first Georgic, in which the poet\r\nremarks that “no religion has forbidden us to draw off water-courses for\r\nirrigating purposes, to enclose crops with fences, or to lay snares for\r\nbirds,” all these things being essential to successful husbandry. But from\r\nthe right to snare birds, our jurisprudent infers the right to\r\nexcommunicate them, since “no snares are stronger than the meshes of an\r\nanathema.” Far-fetched deductions and wretched twaddle of this sort fill\r\nmany pages of the famous lawyer’s dissertation.\r\n\r\nComing down to more recent times, Chassenée mentions several instances of\r\nthe effectiveness of anathemas, accepting as convincing testimony the\r\necstacies of saints and the extravagant statements of hagiologists without\r\nthe slightest expression of doubt as to the truth of these legends. Thus\r\nhe relates how a priest anathematized an orchard, because its fruits\r\ntempted the children of his parish and kept them away from mass. The\r\norchard remained barren until, at the solicitation of the Duchess of\r\nBurgundy, the ban was removed. In like manner the Bishop of Lausanne freed\r\nLake Leman from eels, which had become so numerous as seriously to\r\ninterfere with boating and bathing; on another occasion in the year 1451\r\nthe same ecclesiastic expelled from the waters of this lake an immense\r\nnumber of enormous blood-suckers, which threatened to destroy all the\r\nlarge fish and were especially fatal to salmon, the favourite article of\r\nfood on fast-days. This method of procedure was both cheap and effective\r\nand, as Felix Malleolus informs us in his _Tractatus de Exorcismis_ (I),\r\nreceived the approbation of all the learned doctors of the University of\r\nHeidelberg: _omnes studii Heydelbergensis Doctores hujusmodi ritus\r\nvidentes et legentes consenserunt_. By the same agency an abbot changed\r\nthe sweet white bread of a Count of Toulouse, who abetted and protected\r\nheresy, into black, mouldy bread, so that he, who would fain feed souls\r\nwith corrupt spiritual food, was forced to satisfy his bodily hunger with\r\ncoarse and unsavoury provender. No sooner was the excommunication removed\r\nthan the bread resumed its original purity and colour. Egbert, Bishop of\r\nTrier, anathematized the swallows, which disturbed the devotions of the\r\nfaithful by their chirping and chattering, and sacrilegiously defiled his\r\nhead and vestments with their droppings, when he was officiating at the\r\naltar. He forbade them to enter the sacred edifice on pain of death; and\r\nit is still a popular superstition at Trier, that if a swallow flies into\r\nthe cathedral, it immediately falls to the ground and gives up the ghost.\r\nAnother holy man, known as John the Lamb, cursed the fishes, which had\r\nincurred his anger, with results equally fatal to the finny tribe. It is\r\nalso related of the honey-tongued St. Bernard, that he excommunicated a\r\ncountless swarm of flies, which annoyed the worshippers and officiating\r\npriests in the abbey church of Foigny, and lo, on the morrow they were,\r\nlike Sennacherib’s host, “all dead corpses.” William, Abbot of St.\r\nTheodore in Rheims, who records this miraculous event, states that as soon\r\nas the execration was uttered, the flies fell to the floor in such\r\nquantities that they had to be thrown out with shovels (_palis\r\nejicientes_). This incident, he adds, was so well known that the cursing\r\nof the flies of Foigny became proverbial and formed the subject of a\r\nparable. [_Vita S. Bernardi_, auctore Wilhelmo abbate S. Thod.

I.\r\n11.] According to the usual account, the malediction was not so drastic in\r\nits operation and did not cause the flies to disappear until the next day.\r\nThe rationalist, whose chill and blighting breath is ever nipping the\r\ntender buds of faith, would doubtless suggest that a sharp and sudden\r\nfrost may have added to the force and efficacy of the excommunication. The\r\nsaint resorted to this severe and summary measure, says the monkish\r\nchronicler, because the case was urgent and “no other remedy was at hand.”\r\nPerhaps this lack of other means of relief may refer to the absence of\r\n“deacons with fly-flaps,” who, according to a contemporary writer, were\r\nappointed “to drive away the flies when the Pope celebrateth.”\r\n\r\nThe island Reichenau in Lake Constance, which derives its name from its\r\nfertility and is especially famous for the products of its vineyards and\r\nits orchards, was once so infested by venomous reptiles as to be\r\nuninhabitable by human beings. Early in the eighth century, as the legend\r\ngoes, it was visited by St. Pirminius, and no sooner had he set foot upon\r\nit than these creatures all crawled and wriggled into the water, so that\r\nthe surface of the lake was covered for three days and three nights with\r\nserpents, scorpions and hideous worms. Peculiar vermifugal efficacy was\r\nascribed to the crosier of St. Magnus, the apostle of Algau, which was\r\npreserved in the cloister of St. Mang at Füssen in Bavaria, and from 1685\r\nto 1770 was repeatedly borne in solemn procession to Lucerne, Zug, Schwyz\r\nand other portions of Switzerland for the expulsion and extermination of\r\nrats, mice, cockchafers and other insects. Sometimes formulas of\r\nmalediction were procured directly from the pope, which, like saints’\r\ncurses, could be applied without legal formalities. Thus in 1660 the\r\ninhabitants of Lucerne paid four pistoles and one Roman thaler for a\r\ndocument of this kind; on Nov. 15, 1731, the municipal council of Thonou\r\nin Savoy resolved to join with other parishes of that province to obtain\r\nfrom Rome an excommunication against insects, the expenses for which are\r\nto be assessed _pro rata_;[2] in 1740 the commune of Piuro purchased from\r\nHis Holiness a similar anathema; in the same year the common council of\r\nChiavenna discussed the propriety of applying to Rome for an execratory\r\nagainst beetles and bears; and in December 1752 it was proposed by the\r\nsame body to take like summary measures in order to get rid of a pest of\r\nrodents. In 1729, 1730 and 1749 the municipal council of Lucerne ordered\r\nprocessions to be made on St. Magnus’ Day from the Church of St. Francis\r\nto Peter’s Chapel for the purpose of expelling weevils. This custom was\r\nobserved annually from 1749 to 1798. The pompous ceremony has been\r\nsuperseded in Protestant countries by an officially appointed day of\r\nfasting and prayer.\r\n\r\nIn his “First Counsel” Chassenée not only treats of methods of procedure,\r\nand gives forms of plaints to be drawn up and tendered to the tribunal by\r\nthe injured party, as well as useful hints to the pettifogger in the\r\nexercise of his tortuous and tricky profession, but he also discusses many\r\nlegal principles touching the jurisdiction of courts, the functions of\r\njudges, and other characteristic questions of civil, criminal, and\r\ncanonical law. Animals, he says, should be tried by ecclesiastical\r\ntribunals, except in cases where the penalty involves the shedding of\r\nblood. An ecclesiastical judge is not competent _in causa sanguinis_, and\r\ncan impose only canonical punishments, although he may have jurisdiction\r\nin temporal matters and punish crimes not involving a capital sentence.\r\n[_Nam judex ecclesiasticus in causa sanguinis non est competens judex,\r\nlicet habeat jurisdictionem in temporalibus et possit crimina poenam\r\nsanguinis non existentia_ (_exigentia_ is obviously the correct reading)\r\n_castigare_. Cons. prim. IV. § 5.] For this reason the Church never\r\ncondemned heretics to death, but, having decided that they should die,\r\ngave them over to the secular power for formal condemnation, usually under\r\nthe hollow and hypocritical pretence of recommending them to mercy. In the\r\nprosecution of animals the summons was commonly published from the parish\r\npulpit and the whole judicial process bore a distinctively ecclesiastical\r\ncharacter. In most cases the presiding judge or official was the vicar of\r\nthe parish acting as the deputy of the bishop of the diocese. Occasionally\r\nthe curate officiated in this capacity. Sometimes the trial was conducted\r\nbefore a civil magistrate under the authority of the Church, or the matter\r\nwas submitted to the adjudication of a conjurer, who, however, appointed\r\ntwo proctors to plead respectively for the plaintiff and the defendant and\r\nwho rendered his verdict in due legal form. Indeed, the word “conjurer”\r\nseems to have been used as a popular designation of the person, whether\r\npriest or layman, who exercised judicatory functions in such trials,\r\nprobably because, as a rule, the sentence could be executed only by\r\nconjuration or the invocation of supernatural aid.\r\n\r\nAnother point, which strikes us very comically, but which had to be\r\ndecided before the trial could proceed, was whether the accused were to be\r\nregarded as clergy or laity. Chassenée thinks that there is no necessity\r\nof testing each individual case, but that animals should be looked upon as\r\nlay persons. This, he declares, should be the general presumption; but if\r\nany one wishes to affirm that they have _ordinem clericatus_ and are\r\nentitled to benefit of clergy, the burden of proof rests upon him and he\r\nis bound to show it (_deberet estud probare_). Probably our jurist would\r\nhave made an exception in favour of the beetle, which entomologists call\r\n_clerus_; it is certain, at any rate, that if a bug bearing this name had\r\nbeen brought to trial, the learning and acuteness displayed in arguing the\r\npoint in dispute would have been astounding. We laugh at the subtilties\r\nand quiddities of mediæval theologians, who seriously discussed such silly\r\nquestions as the digestibility of the consecrated elements in the\r\neucharist; but the importance attached to these trivialities was not so\r\nmuch the peculiarity of a single profession as the mental habit of the\r\nage, the result of scholastic training and scholastic methods of\r\ninvestigation, which tainted law no less than divinity. Nevertheless the\r\nancillary relations of all other sciences and disciplines to theology\r\nrender the latter chiefly responsible for this fatal tendency.\r\n\r\nChassenée also makes a distinction between punitive and preventive\r\npurposes in the prosecution of animals, between inflicting penalties upon\r\nthem for crimes committed and taking precautionary measures to keep them\r\nfrom doing damage. By this means he seeks to evade the objection, that\r\nanimals are incapable of committing crimes, because they are not endowed\r\nwith rational faculties. He then proceeds to show that “things not\r\nallowable in respect to crimes already committed are allowable in respect\r\nto crimes about to be committed in order to prevent them.” Thus a layman\r\nmay not arrest an ecclesiastic for a delict fully consummated, but may\r\nseize and detain him in order to hinder the consummation of a delict. In\r\nsuch cases, an inferior may coerce and correct a superior; even an\r\nirrational creature may put restraint upon a human being and hold him back\r\nfrom wrong-doing. In illustration of this legal point he cites an example\r\nfrom Holy Writ, where “Balaam, the prophet and servant of the Most High,\r\nwas rebuked by a she-ass.”\r\n\r\nChassenée endeavours to clinch his argument as usual by quoting biblical\r\ntexts and adducing incidents from legendary literature. The province of\r\nzoö-psychology, which would have furnished him with better material for\r\nthe elucidation of his subject, he leaves untouched, simply because it was\r\nunknown to him. If crime consists in the commission of deeds hurtful to\r\nother sentient beings, knowing such actions to be wrong, then the lower\r\nanimals are certainly guilty of criminal offences. It is a\r\nwell-established fact, that birds, beasts and insects, living together in\r\ncommunities, have certain laws, which are designed to promote the general\r\nwelfare of the herd, the flock or the swarm, and the violation of which by\r\nindividual members they punish corporally or capitally as the case may\r\nrequire. It is likewise undeniable, that domestic animals often commit\r\ncrimes against man and betray a consciousness of the nature of their acts\r\nby showing fear of detection or by trying to conceal what they have done.\r\nMan, too, recognizes their moral responsibility by inflicting chastisement\r\nupon them, and sometimes feels justified in putting incorrigible\r\noffenders, a vicious bull, a thievish cat or a sheep-killing dog,\r\nsummarily to death. Of course this kind of punishment is chiefly\r\npreventive, nevertheless it is provoked by acts already perpetrated and is\r\nnot wholly free from the element of retributive justice. Such a\r\nproceeding, however, is arbitrary and autocratic, and if systematically\r\napplied to human beings would be denounced as intolerable tyranny.\r\nChassenée insists that under no circumstances is a penalty to be imposed\r\nexcept by judicial decision--_nam poena nunquam imponitur, nisi lex\r\nexpresse dicat_--and in support of this principle refers to the apostle\r\nPaul, who declares that “sin is not imputed when there is no law.” He\r\nappears to think that any technical error would vitiate the whole\r\nprocedure and reduce the ban of the Church to mere _brutum fulmen_. If he\r\nlays so great stress upon the observance of legal forms, which in the\r\ncriminal prosecution of brute beasts strike us as the caricature and farce\r\nof justice, it is because he deems them essential to the effectiveness of\r\nan excommunication. The slightest mispronunciation of a word, an incorrect\r\naccentuation or false intonation in uttering a spell suffices to dissolve\r\nthe charm and nullify the occult workings of the magic. The lack of a\r\nsingle link breaks the connection and destroys the binding force of the\r\nchain; everything must be “well-thought, well-said and well-done,” not\r\nethically, but ritually, as prescribed in the old Avestan formula: _humata\r\nhûkhta huvarshta_. All the mutterings and posturings, which accompany the\r\nperformance of a Brahmanical sacrifice, or a Catholic mass, or any other\r\nkind of incantation have their significance, and none of them can be\r\nomitted without marring the perfection of the ceremonial and impairing its\r\npower. An anathema of animals pronounced in accordance with the sentence\r\npassed upon them by a tribunal, belongs to the same category of\r\nconjurations and is rendered nugatory by any formal defect or judicial\r\nirregularity.\r\n\r\nSometimes the obnoxious vermin were generously forewarned. Thus the\r\ngrand-vicars of Jean Rohin, Cardinal Bishop of Autun, having been informed\r\nthat slugs were devastating several estates in different parts of his\r\ndiocese, on the 17th of August, 1487, ordered public processions to be\r\nmade for three days in every parish, and enjoined upon the said slugs to\r\nquit the territory within this period under penalty of being accursed. On\r\nthe 8th of September, 1488, a similar order was issued at Beaujeu. The\r\ncurates were charged to make processions during the offices, and the slugs\r\nwere warned three times to cease from vexing the people by corroding and\r\nconsuming the herbs of the fields and the vines, and to depart; “and if\r\nthey do not heed this our command, we excommunicate them and smite them\r\nwith our anathema.” In 1516, the official of Troyes pronounced sentence on\r\ncertain insects (_adversus brucos seu eurucas vel alia non dissimilia\r\nanimalia, Gallicè urebecs_, probably a species of _curculio_), which laid\r\nwaste the vines, and threatened them with anathema, unless they should\r\ndisappear within six days. Here it is expressly stated that a counsellor\r\nwas assigned to the accused, and a prosecutor heard in behalf of the\r\naggrieved inhabitants. As a means of rendering the anathema more\r\neffective, the people are also urged to be prompt and honest in the\r\npayment of tithes. Chassenée, too, endorses this view, and in proof of its\r\ncorrectness refers to Malachi, where God promises to rebuke the devourer\r\nfor man’s sake, provided all the tithes are brought into the storehouse.\r\n\r\nThe archives of the old episcopal city of St. Jean-de-Maurienne contain\r\nthe original records of legal proceedings instituted against some\r\ninsects, which had ravaged the vineyards of St. Julien, a hamlet situated\r\non the route over Mt. Cenis and famous for the excellence of its vintage.\r\nThe defendants in this case were a species of greenish weevil (charançon)\r\nknown to entomologists as _rychites auratus_, and called by different\r\nnames, amblevin, bèche, verpillion, in different provinces of France.\r\n\r\nComplaint was first made by the wine-growers of St. Julien in 1545 before\r\nFrançois Bonnivard, doctor of laws. The procurator Pierre Falcon and the\r\nadvocate Claude Morel defended the insects, and Pierre Ducol appeared for\r\nthe plaintiffs. After the presentation and discussion of the case by both\r\nparties, the official, instead of passing sentence, issued a proclamation,\r\ndated the 8th of May, 1546, recommending public prayers and beginning with\r\nthe following characteristic preamble: “Inasmuch as God, the supreme\r\nauthor of all that exists, hath ordained that the earth should bring forth\r\nfruits and herbs (_animas vegetativas_), not solely for the sustenance of\r\nrational human beings, but likewise for the preservation and support of\r\ninsects, which fly about on the surface of the soil, therefore it would be\r\nunbecoming to proceed with rashness and precipitance against the animals\r\nnow actually accused and indicted; on the contrary, it would be more\r\nfitting for us to have recourse to the mercy of heaven and to implore\r\npardon for our sins.” Then follow instructions as to the manner in which\r\nthe public prayers are to be conducted in order to propitiate the divine\r\nwrath. The people are admonished to turn to the Lord with pure and\r\nundivided hearts (_ex toto et puro corde_), to repent of their sins with\r\nunfeigned contrition, and to resolve to live henceforth justly and\r\ncharitably, and above all to pay tithes. High mass is to be celebrated on\r\nthree consecutive days, namely on May 20th, 21st, and 22nd, and the host\r\nto be borne in solemn procession with songs and supplications round the\r\nvineyards. The first mass is to be said in honour of the Holy Spirit, the\r\nsecond in honour of the Blessed Virgin, and the third in honour of the\r\ntutelar saint of the parish. At least two persons of each household are\r\nrequired to take part in these religious exercises. A _procès-verbal_,\r\nsigned by the curate Romanet, attests that this programme was fully\r\ncarried out and that the insects soon afterwards disappeared.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years later, however, the scourge was renewed and the\r\ndestructive insects were actually brought to trial. The proceedings are\r\nrecorded on twenty-nine folia and entitled: _De actis scindicorum\r\ncommunitatis Sancti Julliani agentium contra animalia bruta ad formam\r\nmuscarum volantia coloris viridis communi voce appellata verpillions seu\r\namblevins_. The documents, which are still preserved in the archives of\r\nSt. Julien, were communicated by M. Victor Dalbane, secretary of the\r\ncommune, to M. Léon Ménebréa, who printed them in the appendix to his\r\nvolume: _De l’origine de la forme et de l’esprit des jugements rendus au\r\nmoyen-âge contre les animaux_. Chambery, 1846. This treatise appeared\r\noriginally in the twelfth tome of the _Mémoires de la Société Royale\r\nAcadémique de Savoie_.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to add that Ménebréa’s theory of “the spirit, in which\r\nthese judgments against animals were given,” is wholly untenable. He\r\nmaintains that “these procedures formed originally only a kind of symbol\r\nintended to revive the sentiment of justice among the masses of the\r\npeople, who knew of no right except might and of no law except that of\r\nintimidation and violence. In the Middle Ages, when disorder reigned\r\nsupreme, when the weak remained without support and without redress\r\nagainst the strong, and property was exposed to all sorts of attacks and\r\nall forms of ravage and rapine, there was something indescribably\r\nbeautiful in the thought of assimilating the insect of the field to the\r\nmasterpiece of creation and putting them on an equality before the law. If\r\nman should be taught to respect the home of the worm, how much more ought\r\nhe to regard that of his fellow-man and learn to rule in equity.”\r\n\r\nThis explanation is very fine in sentiment, but expresses a modern, and\r\nnot a mediæval way of thinking. The penal prosecution of animals, which\r\nprevailed during the Middle Ages, was by no means peculiar to that period,\r\nbut has been frequently practised by primitive peoples and savage tribes;\r\nneither was it designed to inculcate any such moral lesson as is here\r\nsuggested, nor did it produce any such desirable result. So far from\r\noriginating in a delicate and sensitive sense of justice, it was, as will\r\nbe more fully shown hereafter, the outcome of an extremely crude, obtuse,\r\nand barbaric sense of justice. It was the product of a social state, in\r\nwhich dense ignorance was governed by brute force, and is not to be\r\nconsidered as a reaction and protest against club-law, which it really\r\ntended to foster by making a travesty of the administration of justice and\r\nthus turning it into ridicule. It was also in the interest of\r\necclesiastical dignities to keep up this parody and perversion of a sacred\r\nand fundamental institute of civil society, since it strengthened their\r\ninfluence and extended their authority by subjecting even the caterpillar\r\nand the canker-worm to their dominion and control.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the records of the trial. On the 13th of April, 1587, the\r\ncase was laid before “his most reverend lordship, the prince-bishop of\r\nMaurienne, or the reverend lord his vicar-general and official” by the\r\nsyndics and procurators, François Amenet and Petremand Bertrand, who, in\r\nthe name of the inhabitants of St. Julien, presented the following\r\nstatement and petition: “Formerly by virtue of divine services and\r\nearnest supplications the scourge and inordinate fury of the aforesaid\r\nanimals did cease; now they have resumed their depredations and are doing\r\nincalculable injury. If the sins of men are the cause of this evil, it\r\nbehoveth the representatives of Christ on earth to prescribe such measures\r\nas may be appropriate to appease the divine wrath. Wherefore we the\r\nafore-mentioned syndics, François Amenet and Petremand Bertrand, do appear\r\nanew (_ex integro_) and beseech the official, first, to appoint another\r\nprocurator and advocate for the insects in place of the deceased Pierre\r\nFalcon and Claude Morel, and secondly, to visit the grounds and observe\r\nthe damage, and then to proceed with the excommunication.”\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this request, the distinguished Antoine Filliol was\r\nappointed procurator for the insects, with a moderate fee (_salario\r\nmoderato_), and Pierre Rembaud their advocate. The parties appeared before\r\nthe official on the 30th day of May and the case was adjourned to the 6th\r\nof June, when the advocate, Pierre Rembaud, presented his answer to the\r\ndeclaration of the plaintiffs, showing that their action is not\r\nmaintainable and that they should be nonsuited. After approving of the\r\ncourse pursued by his predecessor in office, he affirms that his clients\r\nhave kept within their right and not rendered themselves liable to\r\nexcommunication, since, as we read in the sacred book of Genesis, the\r\nlower animals were created before man, and God said to them: Let the earth\r\nbring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle and creeping thing,\r\nand beast of the earth after his kind; and he blessed them saying, Be\r\nfruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let fowl\r\nmultiply in the earth. Now the Creator would not have given this command,\r\nhad he not intended that these creatures should have suitable and\r\nsufficient means of support; indeed, he has expressly stated that to every\r\nthing that creepeth upon the earth every green herb has been given for\r\nmeat. It is therefore evident that the accused, in taking up their abode\r\nin the vines of the plaintiffs, are only exercising a legitimate right\r\nconferred upon them at the time of their creation. Furthermore, it is\r\nabsurd and unreasonable to invoke the power of civil and canonical law\r\nagainst brute beasts, which are subject only to natural law and the\r\nimpulses of instinct. The argument urged by the counsel for the\r\nplaintiffs, that the lower animals are made subject to man, he dismisses\r\nas neither true in fact nor pertinent to the present case. He suggests\r\nthat the complainants, instead of instituting judicial proceedings, would\r\ndo better to entreat the mercy of heaven and to imitate the Ninevites,\r\nwho, when they heard the warning voice of the prophet Jonah, proclaimed a\r\nfast and put on sackcloth. In conclusion, he demands that the petition of\r\nthe plaintiffs be dismissed, the monitorium revoked and annulled, and all\r\nfurther proceedings stayed, to which end the gracious office of the judge\r\nis humbly implored (_humiliter implorato benigno officio judicis_).\r\n\r\nThe case was adjourned to the 12th and finally to the 19th of June, when\r\nPetremand Bertrand, the prosecuting attorney, presented a lengthy\r\nreplication, of which the defendants’ advocate demanded a copy with due\r\ntime for deliberation. This request led to a further adjournment till the\r\n26th of June, but as this day turned out to be a _dies feriatus_ or\r\nholiday, no business could be transacted until the 27th, when the advocate\r\nof the commune, François Fay (who seems to have taken the place of Amenet,\r\nif he be not the same person), in reply to the defendants’ plea, argued\r\nthat, although the animals were created before man, they were intended to\r\nbe subordinate to him and subservient to his use, and that this was,\r\nindeed, the reason of their prior creation. They have no _raison d’être_\r\nexcept as they minister to man, who was made to have dominion over them,\r\ninasmuch as all things have been put under his feet, as the Psalmist\r\nasserts and the apostle Paul reiterates. On this point, he concludes, our\r\nopponent has added nothing refutatory of the views, which have been held\r\nfrom time immemorial by our ancestors; we need only refer to the opinions\r\nformerly expressed by the honourable Hippolyte Ducol as satisfactory. The\r\nadvocate for the defence merely remarked that he had not yet received the\r\ndocument ordered on the 19th of June, and the further consideration of the\r\ncase was postponed till the 4th of July. Antoine Filliol then made a\r\nrejoinder to the plaintiffs’ replication, denying that the subordination\r\nof the lower animals to man involves the right of excommunicating them,\r\nand insisting upon his former position, which the opposing counsel had not\r\neven attempted to disprove, namely, that the lower animals are subject\r\nsolely to natural law, “a law originating in the eternal reason and\r\nresting upon a basis as immutable as that of the divine law of revelation,\r\nsince they are derived from the same source, namely, the will and power of\r\nGod.” It is evident, he adds, that the action brought by the plaintiffs is\r\nnot maintainable and that judgment should be given accordingly.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of July, the same parties appear before the official of St.\r\nJean-de-Maurienne. The procurator of the insects demands that the case be\r\nclosed and the plaintiffs debarred from drawing up any additional\r\nstatements or creating any further delay by the introduction of irrelevant\r\nmatter, and requests that a decision be rendered on the documents and\r\ndeclarations already adduced. The prosecuting attorney, whose policy seems\r\nto have been to keep the suit pending as long as possible, applies for a\r\nnew term (_alium terminum_), which was granted.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in view of the law’s long delay, other measures were taken for\r\nthe speedier adjustment of the affair by compromise. On the 29th of June,\r\n1587, a public meeting was called at noon immediately after mass on the\r\ngreat square of St. Julien, known as Parloir d’Amont, to which all hinds\r\nand habitants (_manants et habitants_) were summoned by the ringing of the\r\nchurch bell to consider the propriety and necessity of providing for the\r\nsaid animals a place outside of the vineyards of St. Julien, where they\r\nmight obtain sufficient sustenance without devouring and devastating the\r\nvines of the said commune. This meeting appears to have been held by the\r\nadvice of the plaintiffs’ advocate, François Fay, and at the suggestion of\r\nthe official. A piece of ground in the vicinity was selected and set apart\r\nas a sort of insect enclosure, the inhabitants of St. Julien, however,\r\nreserving for themselves the right to pass through the said tract of land,\r\n“without prejudice to the pasture of the said animals,” and to make use of\r\nthe springs of water contained therein, which are also to be at the\r\nservice of the said animals; they reserve furthermore the right of working\r\nthe mines of ochre and other mineral colours found there, without doing\r\ndetriment to the means of subsistence of said animals, and finally the\r\nright of taking refuge in this spot in time of war or in case of like\r\ndistress. The place chosen is called La Grand Feisse and described with\r\nthe exactness of a topographical survey, not only as to its location and\r\ndimensions, but also as to the character of its foliage and herbage. The\r\nassembled people vote to make this appropriation of land and agree to draw\r\nup a conveyance of it “in good form and of perpetual validity,” provided\r\nthe procurator and advocate of the insects may, on visitation and\r\ninspection of the ground, express themselves satisfied with such an\r\narrangement; in witness whereof the protocol is signed “L. Prunier,\r\ncurial,” and stamped with the seal of the commune.\r\n\r\nBut this attempt of the inhabitants to conciliate the insects and to\r\nsettle their differences by mutual concessions did not put an end to the\r\nlitigation. On the 24th of July, an “Extract from the Register of the\r\nCuriality of St. Julien,” containing the proceedings of the public\r\nmeeting, was submitted to the court by Petremand Bertrand, procurator of\r\nthe plaintiffs, who called attention to the very generous offer made by\r\nthe commune and prayed the official to order the grant to be accepted on\r\nthe conditions specified, and to cause the defendants to vacate the\r\nvineyards and to forbid them to return to the same on pain of\r\nexcommunication. Antoine Filliol, procurator of the insects, requested a\r\ncopy of the _procès-verbal_ and time for deliberation. The court complied\r\nwith this request and adjourned the case till “the first juridical day\r\nafter the harvest vacation,” which fell on the 11th of August, and again\r\nby common consent till the 20th of the same month.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Charles Emanuel I., Duke of Savoy, was preparing to invade\r\nthe Marquisate of Saluzzo, and the confusion caused by the expedition of\r\ntroops over Mt. Cenis interfered with the progress of the trial, which was\r\npostponed till the 27th of August, and again, since the passage of armed\r\nmen was still going on (_actento transitu armigerorum_), till the 3rd of\r\nSeptember, when Antoine Filliol declared that he could not accept for his\r\nclients the offer made by the plaintiffs, because the place was sterile\r\nand neither sufficiently nor suitably supplied with food for the support\r\nof the said animals; he demanded, therefore, that the proposal be rejected\r\nand the action dismissed with costs to the complainants (_petit agentes\r\nrepelli cum expensis_). The “egregious Petremand Bertrand,” in behalf of\r\nthe plaintiffs, denies the correctness of this statement and avers that\r\nthe spot selected and set apart as an abode for the insects is admirably\r\nadapted to this purpose, being full of trees and shrubs of divers kinds,\r\nas stated in the conveyance prepared by his clients, all of which he is\r\nready to verify. He insists, therefore, upon an adjudication in his\r\nfavour. The official took the papers of both parties and reserved his\r\ndecision, appointing experts, who should in the meantime examine the\r\nplace, which the plaintiffs had proffered as an asylum for the insects,\r\nand submit a written report upon the fitness of the same.\r\n\r\nThe final decision of the case, after such careful deliberation and so\r\nlong delay, is rendered doubtful by the unfortunate circumstance that the\r\nlast page of the records has been destroyed by rats or bugs of some sort.\r\nPerhaps the prosecuted weevils, not being satisfied with the results of\r\nthe trial, sent a sharp-toothed delegation into the archives to obliterate\r\nand annul the judgment of the court. At least nothing should be thought\r\nincredible or impossible in the conduct of creatures, which were deemed\r\nworthy of being summoned before ecclesiastical tribunals and which\r\nsucceeded as criminals in claiming the attention and calling forth the\r\nlegal learning and acumen of the greatest jurists of their day.\r\n\r\nIn the margin of the last page are some interesting items of expenses\r\nincurred: “_pro visitatione III flor._,” by which we are to understand\r\nthree florins to the experts, who were appointed to visit the place\r\nassigned to the insects; then “_solverunt scindici Sancti Julliani incluso\r\nprocessu Animalium sigillo ordinationum et pro copia que competat in\r\nprocessu dictorum Animalium omnibus inclusis XVI flor._,” which may be\r\nsummed up as sixteen florins for clerical work including seals; finally,\r\n“_item pro sportulis domini vicarii III flor._,” three florins to the\r\nvicar, who acted as the bishop’s official and did not receive a regular\r\nfee, but was not permitted to go away empty-handed. The date, which\r\nfollows, Dec. 20, 1587, may be assumed to indicate the time at which the\r\ntrial came to an end, after a pendency of more than eight months. (_Vide_\r\nAppendix A.)\r\n\r\nIn the legal proceedings just described, two points are presented with\r\ngreat clearness and seem to be accepted as incontestable: first, the right\r\nof the insects to adequate means of subsistence suited to their nature.\r\nThis right was recognized by both parties; even the prosecution did not\r\ndeny it, but only maintained that they must not trespass cultivated fields\r\nand destroy the fruits of man’s labour. The complainants were perfectly\r\nwilling to assign to the weevils an uncultivated tract of ground, where\r\nthey could feed upon such natural products of the soil as were not due to\r\nhuman toil and tillage. Secondly, no one appears to have doubted for a\r\nmoment that the Church could, by virtue of its anathema, compel these\r\ncreatures to stop their ravages and cause them to go from one place to\r\nanother. Indeed, a firm faith in the existence of this power was the pivot\r\non which the whole procedure turned, and without it, the trial would have\r\nbeen a dismal farce in the eyes of all who took part in it.\r\n\r\nIt is related in the chronicles of an ancient abbey (_Le Père Rochex:\r\nGloire de l’Abbaye et Vallée de la Novalaise_), that St. Eldrad commanded\r\nthe snakes, which infested the environs of a priory in the valley of\r\nBriançon, to depart, and, taking a staff in his hand, conducted them to a\r\ndesert place and shut them up in a cave, where they all miserably\r\nperished. Perhaps the serpent, which suffered Satan to take possession of\r\nits seductive form and thus played such a fatal part in effecting the fall\r\nof man and in introducing sin into the world, may have been regarded as\r\ncompletely out of the pale and protection of law, and as having no rights\r\nwhich an ecclesiastical excommunicator or a wonder-working saint would be\r\nbound to respect. As a rule, however, such an arbitrary abuse of\r\nmiraculous power to the injury or destruction of God’s creatures was\r\nconsidered illegal and unjustifiable, although irascible anchorites and\r\nother holy men under strong provocation often gave way to it. Mediæval\r\njurists frowned upon summary measures of this sort, just as modern lawyers\r\ncondemn the practice of lynch-law as mobbish and essentially seditious,\r\nand only to be excused as a sudden outburst of public indignation at some\r\nexceptionally brutal outrage.\r\n\r\nProperly speaking, animals cannot be excommunicated, but only\r\nanathematized; just as women, according to old English law, having no\r\nlegal status of their own and not being bound in frankpledge as members of\r\nthe decennary or tithable community, could not be outlawed, but only\r\n“waived” or abandoned. This form of ban, while differing theoretically\r\nfrom actual outlawry, was practically the same in its effects upon the\r\nindividual subjected to it. Excommunication is, as the etymology of the\r\nword implies, the exclusion from the communion of the Church and from\r\nwhatever spiritual or temporal advantages may accrue to a person from this\r\nrelation. It is one of the consequences of an anathema, but is limited in\r\nits operation to members of the ecclesiastical body, to which the lower\r\nanimals do not belong. This was the generally accepted view, and is the\r\nopinion maintained by Gaspard Bailly, advocate and councillor of the\r\nSovereign Senate of Savoy, in his _Traité des Monitoires, avec un\r\nPlaidoyer contre les Insects_, printed at Lyons in 1668, but it has not\r\nalways been held by writers on this subject, some of whom do not recognize\r\nthis distinction between anathema and excommunication on the authority of\r\nmany passages of Holy Writ, affirming that, as the whole creation was\r\ncorrupted by the fall, so the atonement extends to all living creatures,\r\nwhich are represented as longing for the day of their redemption and\r\nregeneration.\r\n\r\nOne of the strong points made by the counsel for the defence in\r\nprosecutions of this kind was that these insects were sent to punish man\r\nfor his sins, and should therefore be regarded as agents and emissaries of\r\nthe Almighty, and that to attempt to destroy them or to drive them away\r\nwould be to fight against God (_s’en prendre à Dieu_). Under such\r\ncircumstances, the proper thing to do would be, not to seek legal redress\r\nand to treat the noxious creatures as criminals, but to repent and humbly\r\nto entreat an angry Deity to remove the scourge. This is still the\r\nstandpoint of Christian orthodoxy, Protestant as well as Catholic, and the\r\nargument applies with equal force to the impious and atheistic\r\nsubstitution of Paris green and the chlorate of lime for prayer and\r\nfasting as exterminators of potato-bugs. The modern, like the mediæval\r\nhorticulturist may ward off devouring vermin from his garden by the use of\r\nashes, but he strews them on his plants instead of sprinkling them on his\r\nown head, and thus indicates to what extent scientific have superseded\r\ntheological methods in the practical affairs of life.\r\n\r\nThomas Aquinas, the “angelic doctor,” in his _Summa Theologiæ_ raises the\r\nquery, whether it is permissible to curse irrational creatures (_utrum\r\nliceat irrationabiles creaturas adjurare_). He states, in the first place,\r\nthat curses and blessings can be pronounced only upon such things as are\r\nsusceptible of receiving evil or good impressions from them, or in other\r\nwords, upon sentient and rational beings, or upon irrational creatures and\r\ninsentient things in their relation to rational beings, so that the latter\r\nare the objects ultimately aimed at and favourably or unfavourably\r\naffected. Thus God cursed the earth, because it is essential to a man’s\r\nsubsistence; Jesus cursed the barren fig-tree symbolizing the Jews, who\r\nmade a great show of leafage in the form of rites and ceremonies, but bore\r\nno fruits of righteousness; Job cursed the day on which he was born,\r\nbecause he took from his mother’s womb the taint of original sin; David\r\ncursed the rocks and mountains of Gilboa, because they were stained with\r\nthe blood of “the beauty of Israel”; in like manner the Lord sends locusts\r\nand blight and mildew to destroy the harvests, because these are\r\nintimately connected with the happiness of mankind, whose sins he wishes\r\nto punish.\r\n\r\nIt is laid down as a legal maxim by mediæval jurisprudents that no animal\r\ndevoid of understanding can commit a fault (_nec enim potest animal\r\ninjuriam fecisse quod sensu caret_). This doctrine is endorsed by the\r\ngreat theologian and scholastic Thomas of Aquino. If we regard the lower\r\nanimals, he says, as creatures coming from the hand of God and employed by\r\nhim as agents for the execution of his judgments, then to curse them would\r\nbe blasphemous; if, on the other hand, we curse them _secundem se_, i.e.\r\nmerely as brute beasts, then the malediction is odious and vain and\r\ntherefore unlawful (_est odiosum et vanum et per consequens illicitum_).\r\nThere is, however, another ground, on which the right of excommunication\r\nor anathematization may be asserted and fully vindicated, namely, that the\r\nlower animals are satellites of Satan “instigated by the powers of hell\r\nand therefore proper to be cursed,” as the Doctor angelicus puts it.\r\nChassenée refers to this opinion in the treatise already cited (I. § 75),\r\nand adds “the anathema then is not to be pronounced against the animals as\r\nsuch, but should be hurled inferentially (_per modum conclusionis_) at the\r\ndevil, who makes use of irrational creatures to our detriment.” This\r\nnotion seems to have been generally accepted in the Middle Ages, and the\r\nfact that evil spirits are often mentioned in the Bible metaphorically or\r\nsymbolically as animals and assumed to be incarnate in the adder, the asp,\r\nthe basilisk, the dragon, the lion, the leviathan, the serpent, the\r\nscorpion, etc., was considered confirmatory of this view.\r\n\r\nBut not all animals were regarded as diabolical incarnations; on the\r\ncontrary, many were revered as embodiments and emblems of divine\r\nperfections. In a work entitled _Le Liure du Roy Modus et de la Reyne\r\nRacio_ (The Book of King Mode and Queen Reason), which, as the colophon\r\nrecords, was “printed at Chambery by Anthony Neyret in the year of grace\r\none thousand four hundred and eighty-six on the thirtieth day of October,”\r\nKing Mode discourses on falconry and venery in general. Queen Reason\r\nbrings forward, in reply to these rather conventional commonplaces,\r\n“several fine moralities,” and dilates on the natural and mystic qualities\r\nof animals, which she divides into two classes, sweet beasts (_bestes\r\ndoulces_) and stenchy beasts (_bestes puantes_). Foremost among the sweet\r\nbeasts stands that which Milton characterizes as\r\n\r\n  “Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Psalmist, the hart panting after the water-brooks\r\nrepresents the soul thirsting for the living God and is the type of\r\nreligious ardour and aspiration. It plays an important part in the legends\r\nof saints, acts as their guide, shows them where holy relics are\r\nconcealed, and causes St. Eustace and St. Hubert to abandon the chase and\r\nto lead lives of pious devotion by appearing to them with a luminous cross\r\nbetween its antlers. The ten branches of its horns symbolize the ten\r\ncommandments of the Old Testament and signify in the Roman ritual the ten\r\nfingers of the outstretched hand of the priest as he works the perpetual\r\nmiracle of transubstantiation of the eucharist.\r\n\r\nChief of the stenchy beasts is the pig. In paganism, which to the\r\nChristians was merely devil-worship, the boar was an object of peculiar\r\nadoration; for this reason the farrow of the sow is supposed to number\r\nseven shotes, corresponding to the seven deadly sins. To the same class of\r\noffensive beasts belong the wolf, typical of bad spiritual shepherds, and\r\nthe fox, which is described as follows: “Reynard is a beast of small size,\r\nwith red hair, a long bushy tail and an evil physiognomy, for his visage\r\nis thin and sharp, his eyes deep-set and piercing, his ears small,\r\nstraight and pointed; moreover he is deceitful and tricky above all other\r\nbeasts and exceedingly malicious.” “We are all,” adds Queen Reason in a\r\nmoralizing strain, “more or less of the brotherhood of Saint Fausset,\r\nwhose influence is now-a-days quite extended.” Among birds the raven is\r\npre-eminently a malodorous creature and imp of Satan, whereas the dove is\r\na sweet beast and the chosen vessel for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,\r\nthe form in which the third person of the Trinity became incarnate.\r\n\r\nThis division of beasts corresponds in principle to that which is given in\r\nthe Avesta, and according to which all animals are regarded as belonging\r\neither to the good creation of Ahuramazda or to the evil creation of\r\nAngrô-mainyush. The world is the scene of perpetual conflict between these\r\nhostile forces summed up in the religion and ethics of Zarathushtra as the\r\ntrinity of the good thought, the good word, and the good deed (_humata_,\r\n_hûkhta_, _huvarshta_), which are to be fostered in opposition to the evil\r\nthought, the evil word, and the evil deed (_dushmata_, _duzhûkhta_,\r\n_duzhvarshta_), which are to be constantly combated and finally\r\nsuppressed. Every man is called upon by the Iranian prophet to choose\r\nbetween these contraries; and not only the present and future state of his\r\nown soul, the complexion of his individual character, but also the welfare\r\nof the whole world, the ultimate destiny of the universe, depend, to no\r\ninconsiderable extent, upon his choice. His thoughts, words, and deeds do\r\nnot cease with the immediate effect which they are intended to produce,\r\nbut, like force in the physical world, are persistent and indestructible.\r\nAs the very slightest impulse given to an atom of matter communicates\r\nitself to every other atom, and thus disturbs the equilibrium of the\r\nglobe--the footfall of a child shaking the earth to its centre--so the\r\ninfluence of every human life, however small, contributes to the general\r\nincrease and ascendency of either good or evil, and helps to determine\r\nwhich of these principles shall ultimately triumph. In the universal\r\nstrife of these “mighty opposites,” the vicious are the allies of the\r\ndevil; while the virtuous are not merely engaged in working out their own\r\nsalvation, but have also the ennobling consciousness of being\r\nfellow-combatants with the Deity, who needs and appreciates their services\r\nin overcoming the adversary. This sense of solidarity with the Best and\r\nthe Highest imparts additional elevation and peculiar dignity to human\r\naims and actions, and lends to devotion a warmth of sympathy and fervour\r\nof enthusiasm springing from personal attachment and loyalty, which it is\r\ndifficult for the Religion of Humanity to inspire. The fact, too, that\r\nevil exists in the world, not by the will and design of the Good Being,\r\nbut in spite of him, and that all his powers are put forth to eradicate\r\nit, while detracting from his omnipotence, frees him from all moral\r\nobliquity and exalts his character for benevolence, thus rendering him far\r\nmore worthy of love and worship and a much better model for human\r\nimitation than that “dreadful idealization of wickedness” which is called\r\nGod in the Calvinistic creed. The idea that the humblest person may, by\r\nthe purity and rectitude of his life, not only strengthen himself in\r\nvirtue, but also increase the actual aggregate of goodness in the universe\r\nand even endue the Deity with greater power and aggressive energy in\r\nsubduing and extirpating evil, is surely a sublime thought and a source of\r\nlofty inspiration and encouragement in well-doing, although it has been\r\ndegraded by Parsi Dasturs--as all grand conceptions and ideals are apt to\r\nbe under priestly influences--into a ridiculous and childish hatred of\r\nsnakes, scorpions, frogs, lizards, water-rats, and other animals supposed\r\nto have been produced by Angrô-mainyush.\r\n\r\nPlato held a similar theory of creation, regarding it not as the\r\nmanifestation of pure benevolence endowed with almighty power, but rather\r\nas the expression of perfect goodness working at disadvantage in an\r\nintractable material, which by its inherent stubbornness prevented the\r\nfull embodiment and realization of the original purpose and desire of the\r\nCreator or Cosmourgos, who was therefore obliged to content himself with\r\nwhat was, under the circumstances, the only possible, but by no means the\r\nbest imaginable, world. The Manicheans attributed the same unsatisfactory\r\nresult to the activity of an evil principle, which thwarted the complete\r\nactualization of the designs of the Deity. So conspicuous, indeed, is the\r\ndefectiveness of nature as a means of promoting the highest conceivable\r\nhuman happiness, so marked and manifold are the causes of suffering in all\r\nspheres of sentient existence, and so often do the elements seem to\r\nconspire for the destruction of mankind, raging relentlessly like a wild\r\nbeast\r\n\r\n  “Red in tooth and claw\r\n   With ravin,”\r\n\r\nthat every cosmogony has been compelled to assume the persistent\r\nintervention of some malignant spirit or perverse agency as the only\r\nrational explanation of such a condition of things. The orthodox\r\nChristianity of to-day gives over the earth entirely to the sovereignty of\r\nSatan, the successful usurper of Eden, and instead of bidding the\r\nrighteous to look forward to the final re-enthronement and absolute\r\nsupremacy of truth and goodness in this world as the\r\n\r\n  “One far-off divine event,\r\n   To which the whole creation moves,”\r\n\r\nconsoles them with the vague promise of compensation in a future state of\r\nbeing. Even this remote prospect of redemption is confined to a select\r\nfew; not only is the earth destined to be burned with fire on account of\r\nits utter corruption, but the great majority of its inhabitants are doomed\r\nto eternal torments in the abode of evil spirits.\r\n\r\nScientific research also leads to the same conclusions in respect to the\r\nincompleteness of Nature’s handiwork, which it is the function of art and\r\nculture to amend and improve. Everywhere the correcting hand and\r\ncontriving brain of man are needed to eliminate the worthless and noxious\r\nproductions, in which Nature is so fatally prolific, and to foster and\r\ndevelop those that are useful and salutary, thus beautifying and ennobling\r\nall forms of vegetable and animal life. By a like process man himself has\r\nattained his present pre-eminence. Through long ages of strife and\r\nstruggle he has emerged from brutishness and barbarism, and rising by a\r\nslow, spiral ascent, scarcely perceptible for generations, has been able\r\ngradually to\r\n\r\n  “Move upward, working out the beast,\r\n   And let the ape and tiger die.”\r\n\r\nThe more man increases in wisdom and intellectual capacity, the more\r\nefficient he becomes as a co-worker with the good principle. At the same\r\ntime, every advance which he makes in civilization brings with it some new\r\nevil for him to overcome; or, as the Parsi would express it\r\nmythologically, every conquest achieved by Ahuramazda and his allies\r\nstimulates Angrômainyush and his satellites to renewed exertions, who\r\nconvert the most useful discoveries, like dynamite, into instruments of\r\ndiabolical devastation. The opening of the Far West in the United States\r\nto agriculture and commerce, and the completion of the Pacific Railroad,\r\nnot only served to multiply and diffuse the gifts of the beneficent and\r\nbountiful spirit (_speñtô mainyush_), but also facilitated the propagation\r\nand spread of the plagues of the grasshopper and the Colorado beetle. The\r\npower of destruction insidiously concealed in the minutest insect organism\r\noften exceeds that of the tornado and the earthquake, and baffles the most\r\npersistent efforts of human ingenuity to resist it. The genius and energy\r\nof Pasteur were devoted for years to the task of detecting and destroying\r\na microscopic parasite, which threatened to ruin for ever the silk\r\nindustry of France; and the Phylloxera and Doryphora still continue to\r\nravage with comparative impunity the vineyards of Europe and the\r\npotato-fields of America, defying at once all the appliances of science\r\nfor their extermination and all the attempts of casuistic theology to\r\nreconcile such scourges with a perfectly benevolent and omnipotent Creator\r\nand Ruler of the Universe. It is the observation of phenomena like these\r\nthat confirms the modern Parsi in the faith of his fathers, and reveals to\r\nhim, in the operations of nature and the conflicts of life, unquestionable\r\nevidences of a contest between warring elements personified as Hormazd\r\nand Ahriman, the ultimate issue of which is to be the complete triumph of\r\nthe former and the consequent purification and redemption of the world\r\nfrom the curse of evil. The Parsi, however, recognizes no Saviour, and\r\nrepudiates as absurd and immoral any scheme of atonement whereby the\r\nburden of sin can be shifted from the shoulders of the guilty to those of\r\nan innocent, vicarious victim. Every person must be redeemed by his own\r\ngood thoughts, words, and deeds, as creation must be redeemed by the good\r\nthoughts, words, and deeds of the race. After death, the character of each\r\nindividual thus formed appears to him, either in the form of a beautiful\r\nand brilliant maiden, who leads him over the Chinvad (or gatherer’s)\r\nbridge, into the realms of everlasting light, or in the form of a foul\r\nharlot, who thrusts him down into regions of eternal gloom.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression; it is not only in the Venidad that\r\ncertain classes of animals are declared to be creations of the archfiend,\r\nand therefore embodiments of devils; additional proofs of this doctrine\r\nwere derived by mediæval writers from biblical and classical sources. A\r\nfavourite example was the metamorphosis of Nebuchadnezzar, who, when given\r\nover to Satan, dwelt with the beasts of the field and ate grass as oxen,\r\nwhile his hair grew like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’\r\nclaws. Still more numerous and striking instances of this kind were drawn\r\nfrom pagan mythology, which, being of diabolical origin, would naturally\r\nbe prolific of such phenomena. Thus, besides centaurs and satyrs, “dire\r\nchimeras” and other “delicate monsters,” there were hybrids like the\r\nsemi-dragon Cecrops and transformations by which Io became a heifer,\r\nDædalion a sparrow-hawk, Corone a crow, Actæon a stag, Lyncus a lynx, Mæra\r\na dog, Calisto a she-bear, Antigone a stork, Arachne a spider, Iphigenia a\r\nroe, Talus a partridge, Itys a pheasant, Tereus Ascalaphus and Nyctimene\r\nowls, Philomela a nightingale, Progne a swallow, Cadmus and his spouse\r\nHarmonia snakes, Decertis a fish, Galanthis a weasel, and the warriors of\r\nDiomedes birds, while the companions of Ulysses were changed by Circe, the\r\nprototype of the modern witch, into swine. All these metamorphoses are\r\nadduced as the results of Satanic agencies and proofs of the tendency of\r\nevil spirits to manifest themselves in bestial forms.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the ninth century the region about Rome was visited by\r\na dire plague of locusts. A reward was offered for their extermination and\r\nthe peasants gathered and destroyed them by millions; but all efforts were\r\nin vain, since they propagated faster than it was possible to kill them.\r\nFinally Pope Stephen VI. prepared great quantities of holy water and had\r\nthe whole country sprinkled with it, whereupon the locusts immediately\r\ndisappeared. The formula used in consecrating the water and devoting it to\r\nthis purpose implies the diabolical character of the vermin against which\r\nit was directed: “I adjure thee, creature water, I adjure thee by the\r\nliving God, by Him, who at the beginning separated thee from the dry land,\r\nby the true God, who caused thee to fertilize the garden of Eden and\r\nparted thee into four heads, by Him, who at the marriage of Cana changed\r\nthee into wine, I adjure thee that thou mayst not suffer any imp or\r\nphantom to abide in thy substance, that thou mayst be indued with\r\nexorcising power and become a source of salvation, so that when thou art\r\nsprinkled on the fruits of the field, on vines, on trees, on human\r\nhabitations in the city or in the country, on stables, or on flocks, or if\r\nany one may touch or taste thee, thou shalt become a remedy and a relief\r\nfrom the wiles of Satan, that through thee plagues and pestilence may be\r\ndriven away, that through contact with thee weevils and caterpillars,\r\nlocusts and moles may be dispersed and the maliciousness of all visible\r\nand invisible powers hostile to man may be brought to nought.” In the\r\nprayers which follow, the water is entreated to “preserve the fruits of\r\nthe earth from insects, mice, moles, serpents and other foul spirits.”\r\n\r\nThis subject was treated in a lively and entertaining manner by a Jesuit\r\npriest, Père Bougeant, in a book entitled _Amusement Philosophique sur le\r\nLangage des Bestes_, which was written in the form of a letter addressed\r\nto a lady and published at Paris in 1739. In the first place, the author\r\nrefers to the intelligence shown by animals and refutes the Cartesian\r\ntheory that they are mere machines or animated automata. This tenet, we\r\nmay add, was not original with Descartes, but was set forth at length by a\r\nSpanish physician, Gomez Pereira, in a bulky Latin volume bearing the\r\nqueer dedicatory title: “_Antoniana Margarita opus nempe physicis, medicis\r\nac theologis non minus utile quam necessarium_,” and printed in 1554,\r\nnearly a century before the publication of Descartes’ _Meditationes de\r\nprima philosophia and Principia philosophiae_, which began a new epoch in\r\nthe history of philosophy.\r\n\r\nIf animals are nothing but ingenious pieces of mechanism, argues the\r\nJesuit father, then the feelings of a man towards his dog would not differ\r\nfrom those which he entertains towards his watch, and they would both\r\ninspire him with the same kind of affection. But such is not the case.\r\nEven the strictest Cartesian would never think of petting his chronometer\r\nas he pets his poodle, or would expect the former to respond to his\r\ncaresses as the latter does. Practically he subverts his own metaphysical\r\nsystem by the distinction which he makes between them, treating one as a\r\nmachine and the other as a sentient being, endowed with mental powers and\r\npassions corresponding, in some degree, to those which he himself\r\npossesses. We infer from our own individual consciousness that other\r\npersons, who act as we do, are free and intelligent agents, as we claim to\r\nbe. The same reasoning applies to the lower animals, whose manifestations\r\nof joy, sorrow, hope, fear, desire, love, hatred and other emotions, akin\r\nto those passing in our own minds, prove that there is within them a\r\nspiritual principle, which does not differ essentially from the human\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nBut this conclusion, he adds, is contrary to the teachings of the\r\nChristian religion, since it involves the immortality of animal souls and\r\nnecessitates some provision for their reward or punishment in a future\r\nlife. If they are capable of merits and demerits and can incur praise and\r\nblame, then they are worthy of retribution hereafter and there must be a\r\nheaven and a hell prepared for them, so that the pre-eminence of a man\r\nover a beast as an object of God’s mercy or wrath is lost. “Beasts, in\r\nthat case, would be a species of man or men a species of beast, both of\r\nwhich propositions are incompatible with the teachings of religion.” The\r\nonly means of reconciling these views, endowing animals with intellectual\r\nsense and immortal souls without running counter to Christian dogmas, is\r\nto assume that they are incarnations of evil spirits.\r\n\r\nOrigen held that the scheme of redemption embraced also Satan and his\r\nsatellites, who would be ultimately converted and restored to their\r\nprimitive estate. Several patristic theologians endorsed this notion, but\r\nthe Church rejected it as heretical. The devils are, therefore, from the\r\nstandpoint of Catholic orthodoxy, irrevocably damned and the blood of\r\nChrist has made no atonement for them. But, although their fate is sealed\r\ntheir torments have not yet begun. If a man dies in his sins, his soul, as\r\nsoon as it departs from his body, receives its sentence and goes straight\r\nto hell. The highest ecclesiastical authorities have decided that this is\r\nnot true of devils, who, although condemned to everlasting fire, do not\r\nenter upon their punishment until after the judgment-day. This view is\r\nsupported by many passages and incidents of Holy Writ. Thus Christ\r\ndeclares that, when the Son of man shall come in his glory, he shall say\r\nunto them on his left hand, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting\r\nfire prepared for the devil and his angels.” Here it is not stated that\r\nthe devils are already burning, but that the fire has been “prepared” for\r\nthem, a form of expression which leads us to infer that they were not yet\r\nin it. Again the devils, which Christ drove out of the two “exceeding\r\nfierce” demoniacs, protested against such interference, saying, “Art thou\r\ncome hither to torment us before the time?” This question has no\r\nsignificance, unless we suppose that they had a right to inhabit such\r\nliving beings as had been assigned to them, until the time of their\r\ntorment should come on the last day. Père Bougeant is furthermore of the\r\nopinion that, when these devils were sent miraculously and therefore\r\nabnormally into the swine, they came into conflict with the devils already\r\nin possession of the pigs, and thus caused the whole herd to run violently\r\ndown a steep place into the sea. Even a hog, he thinks, could not stand it\r\nto harbour more than one devil at a time, and would be driven to suicide\r\nby having an intrinsic and superfluous demon conjured into it. A still\r\nmore explicit and decisive declaration on this point is found in the\r\nEpistle of Jude and the Second Epistle of Peter, where it is stated that\r\nthe angels which kept not their first estate the Lord hath reserved in\r\neverlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.\r\nThese words are to be understood figuratively as referring to the\r\nirrevocableness of their doom and the durance vile to which they are\r\nmeanwhile subjected. That they are held in some sort of temporary custody\r\nand are not actually undergoing, but still awaiting the punishment, which\r\ndivine justice has imposed upon them, the sacred scriptures and the\r\nteachings of the Church leave no manner of doubt.\r\n\r\nNow the question arises as to what these legions of devils are doing in\r\nthe meantime. Some of them are engaged in “going to and fro in the earth\r\nand walking up and down in it,” in order to spy out and take advantage of\r\nhuman infirmities. God himself makes use of them to test the fealty of men\r\nand their power of holding fast to their integrity under severe\r\ntemptations, just as the Creator made fossils and concealed them in the\r\ndifferent strata of the earth, in order to see whether Christian faith in\r\nthe truth of revelation would be strong enough to resist the seductions of\r\n“science falsely so called.” Other devils enter into living human bodies\r\nand give themselves up to evil enchantments as wizards and witches; others\r\nstill reanimate corpses or assume the form and features of the dead and\r\nwander about as ghosts and hobgoblins. Not only were pagans regarded by\r\nthe Christian Church as devil-worshippers and exorcised before being\r\nbaptized, but it is also a logical deduction from the doctrine of original\r\nsin, that a devil takes possession of every child as soon as it is born\r\nand remains there until expelled by an ecclesiastical functionary, who\r\ncombines the office of priest with that of conjurer and is especially\r\nappointed for this purpose. Hence arose the necessity of abrenunciation,\r\nas it was called, which preceded baptism in the Catholic Church and which\r\nLuther and the Anglican reformers retained. Before the candidate was\r\nchristened he was exorcised and adjured personally, if an adult, or\r\nthrough a sponsor, if an infant, to “forsake the devil and all his works.”\r\nThese words, which still hold a place in the ritual, but are now repeated\r\nin a perfunctory manner by persons, who have no conception of the magic\r\npotency formerly ascribed to them, are a survival of the old formula of\r\nexorcism. In the seventeenth century there was a keen competition between\r\nthe Roman Catholic and the Lutheran clergy in casting out devils, the\r\nformer claiming that to them alone had been transmitted the exorcising\r\npower conferred by Christ upon his apostles. The Protestant churches\r\nfinally gave up the hocus-pocus and during the eighteenth century it fell\r\ninto general discredit and disuse among them, although some of the\r\nstiffest and most conservative Lutherans never really abandoned it in\r\nprinciple and have recently endeavoured to revive it in practice.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church, on the contrary, still holds that men, women and\r\ncattle may be possessed by devils and prescribes the means of their\r\nexpulsion. In a work entitled _Rituale ecclesiasticum ad usum clericorum\r\nS. Fransisci_ by Pater Franz Xaver Lohbauer (Munich, 1851), there is a\r\nchapter on the mode of helping those who are afflicted by demons (_Modus\r\njuvandi afflictos a daemone_). The author maintains that nearly all\r\nso-called nervous diseases, hysteria, epilepsy, insanity, and milder forms\r\nof mental alienation, are either the direct result of diabolical agencies\r\nor attended and greatly aggravated by them. A sound mind in a sound body\r\nmay make a man devil-proof, but Satan is quick to take advantage of his\r\ninfirmities in order to get possession of his person. The adversary is\r\nconstantly lying in wait watching for and trying to produce physical\r\nderangements as breaches in the wall, through which he may rush in and\r\ncapture the citadel of the soul. In all cases of this sort the priest is\r\nto be called in with the physician, and the medicines are to be blessed\r\nand sprinkled with holy water before being administered. Exorcisms and\r\nconjurations are not only to be spoken over the patient, but also to be\r\nwritten on slips of consecrated paper and applied, like a plaster, to the\r\nparts especially affected. The physician should keep himself supplied with\r\nthese written exorcisms, to be used when it is impossible for a priest to\r\nbe present. As with patent medicines, the public is warned against\r\ncounterfeits, and no exorcism is genuine unless it is stamped with the\r\nseal and bears the signature of the bishop of the diocese. According to\r\nFather Lohbauer, the demon is the efficient cause of the malady, and there\r\ncan be no cure until the evil one is cast out. This is the office of the\r\npriest; the physician then heals the physical disorder, repairing the\r\ndamage done to the body, and, as it were, stopping the gaps with his drugs\r\nso as to prevent the demon from getting in again. Thus science and\r\nreligion are reconciled and work together harmoniously for the healing of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church has a general form of _Benedictio a daemone\r\nvexatorum_, for the relief of those vexed by demons; and Pope Leo XIII.,\r\nwho was justly esteemed as a man of more than ordinary intelligence and\r\nmore thoroughly imbued with the modern spirit than any of his\r\npredecessors, composed and issued, November 19, 1890, a formula of\r\n_Exorcismus in Satanam et Angelos Apostatas_ worthy of a place in any\r\nmediæval collection of conjurations. His Holiness never failed to repeat\r\nthis exorcism in his daily prayers, and commended it to the bishops and\r\nother clergy as a potent means of warding off the assaults of Satan and of\r\ncasting out devils. In 1849 the Bishop of Passau published a _Manuale\r\nBenedictionum_, and as late as 1893 Dr. Theobald Bischofberger described\r\nand defended the practice of the papal see, in this respect, in a brochure\r\nprinted in Stuttgart and entitled _Die Verwaltung des Exorcistats nach\r\nMassgabe der römischen Benediktionale_.\r\n\r\nThat these formulas are still deemed highly efficacious is evident from\r\nthe many recent cases in which they have been employed. Thus in 1842 a\r\ndevil named Ro-ro-ro-ro took possession of “a maiden of angelic beauty” in\r\nLuxemburg and was cast out by Bishop Laurentius. This demon claimed to be\r\none of the archangels expelled from heaven, and appears to have rivalled\r\nParson Stöcker and Rector Ahlwardt in Anti-semitic animosity; when the\r\nname of Jesus was mentioned, he cried out derisively: “O, that Jew! Didn’t\r\nhe have to drink gall?” When commanded to depart, he begged that he might\r\ngo into some Jew. The bishop, however, refused to give him leave and bade\r\nhim “go to hell,” which he forthwith did, “moaning as he went, in\r\nmelancholy tones, that seemed to issue from the bowels of the earth,\r\n‘Burning, burning, everlastingly burning in hell!’ The voice was so sad,”\r\nadds the bishop, “that we should have wept for sheer compassion, had we\r\nnot known that it was the devil.”\r\n\r\nAgain, a lay brother connected with an educational institute in Rome\r\nbecame diabolically possessed on January 3, 1887, and was exorcised by\r\nFather Jordan. In this instance the leading spirit was Lucifer himself,\r\nattended by a host of satellites, of whom Lignifex, Latibor, Monitor,\r\nRitu, Sefilie, Shulium, Haijunikel, Exaltor, and Reromfex were the most\r\nimportant. It took about an hour and a half to cast out these demons the\r\nfirst time, but they renewed their assaults on February 10th, 11th, and\r\n17th, and were not completely discomfited and driven back into the\r\ninfernal regions until February 23rd, and then only by using the water of\r\nLourdes, which, as Father Jordan states, acted upon them like poison,\r\ncausing them to writhe to and fro. Lucifer was especially rude and saucy\r\nin his remarks. Thus, for example, when Father Jordan said, “Every knee in\r\nheaven and on the earth shall bow to the name of Jesus,” the fallen “Son\r\nof the Morning” retorted, “Not Luci, not Luci--never!”\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply authentic reports of things of this sort that\r\nhave happened within the memory of the present generation, such as the\r\nexorcism of a woman of twenty-seven at Laas in the Tyrol in the spring of\r\n1892, and the expulsion of an evil spirit from a boy ten years of age at\r\nWemding in Bavaria by a capuchin, Father Aurelian, July 13th and 14th,\r\n1891, with the sanction of the bishops of Augsburg and Eichstätt. In the\r\nlatter case we have a circumstantial account of the affair by the exorcist\r\nhimself, who, in conclusion, uses the following strong language:\r\n“Whosoever denies demoniacal possession in our days confesses thereby that\r\nhe has gone astray from the teaching of the Catholic Church; but he will\r\nbelieve in it when he himself is in the possession of the devil in hell.\r\nAs for myself I have the authority of two bishops.” In a pamphlet on this\r\nsubject printed at Munich in 1892, and entitled _Die Teufelsaustreibung in\r\nWemding_, the author, Richard Treufels, takes the same view, declaring\r\nthat diabolical possession “is an incontestable fact, confirmed by the\r\ntraditions of all nations of ancient and modern times, by the unequivocal\r\ntestimony of the Old and New Testaments, and by the teaching and practice\r\nof the Catholic Church.” Christ, he says, gave his disciples power and\r\nauthority over all devils to cast them out, and the same power is\r\ndivinely conferred upon every priest by his consecration, although it is\r\nnever to be exercised without the permission of his bishop.\r\n\r\nDoubtless modern science by investigating the laws and forces of nature is\r\ngradually diminishing the realm of superstition; but there are vast\r\nlow-lying plains of humanity that have not yet felt its enlightening and\r\nelevating influence. It has been estimated that nine-tenths of the rural\r\npopulation of Europe and ninety-nine hundredths of the peasantry, living\r\nin the vicinity of a cloister and darkened by its shadow, believe in the\r\nreality of diabolical possession and attribute most maladies of men and\r\nmurrain in cattle to the direct agency of Satan, putting their faith in\r\nthe “metaphysical aid” of the conjurer rather than in medical advice and\r\nveterinary skill.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this belief is not confined to Catholics and boors, but is\r\nheld by Protestants, who are considered persons of education and superior\r\nculture. Dr. Lyman Abbott asserted in a sermon preached in Plymouth\r\nChurch, that “what we call the impulses of our lower nature are the\r\nwhispered suggestions of fiend-like natures, watching for our fall and\r\nexultant if they can accomplish it.” But while affirming that “evil\r\nspirits exercise an influence over mankind,” and that cranks like Guiteau,\r\nthe assassin of President Garfield, are diabolically possessed, the\r\nreverend divine would hardly risk his reputation for sanity by attempting\r\nto exorcise the supposed demon. The Catholic priest holds the same view,\r\nbut has the courage of his convictions and goes solemnly to work with\r\nbell, book and candle to effect the expulsion of the indwelling fiend.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such methods of healing are sometimes successful is adduced\r\nas conclusive proof of their miraculous character; but this inference is\r\nwholly incorrect. Professor Dr. Hoppe, in an essay on _Der Teufels- und\r\nGeisterglaube und die psychologische Erklärung des Besessenseins_\r\n(_Allgemeine Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie_, Bd. LV. p. 290), gives a\r\npsychological explanation of these puzzling phenomena. “The priest,” he\r\nsays, “exerts a salutary influence upon the brain through the respect and\r\ndignity which he inspires, just as Christ in his day wrought upon those\r\nwho were sick and possessed with devils.” Indeed, it is expressly stated\r\nby the evangelist that Jesus did not attempt to do wonderful works among\r\npeople who did not believe. According to this theory the exorcism effects\r\na cure by its powerful action on the imagination, just as there are\r\nfrequent ailments, for which a wise physician administers bread pills and\r\na weak solution of powdered sugar as the safest and best medicaments.\r\nProfessor Hoppe, therefore, approves of “priestly conjurations for the\r\nexpulsion of devils as a psychical means of healing,” and thinks that the\r\nmore ceremoniously the rite can be performed in the presence of grave and\r\nvenerable witnesses, the more effective it will be. This opinion is\r\nendorsed by a Catholic priest, Friedrich Jaskowski, in a pamphlet entitled\r\n_Der Trierer Rock und seine Patienten vom Jahre 1891_ (Saarbrücken: Carl\r\nSchmidtke, 1894). The author belongs to the diocese of Trier and is\r\ntherefore under the jurisdiction of the bishop, Dr. Felix Korum, whose\r\nstatements concerning the miracles wrought and the evidences of divine\r\nmercy manifested during the exhibition of the “holy coat” in 1891 he\r\ncourageously reviews and conclusively refutes. The bishop had printed what\r\nhe called “documentary proofs,” consisting of certificates issued by\r\nobscure curates and country doctors, that certain persons suffering\r\nchiefly from diseases of the nervous system had been healed, and sought to\r\ndiscover in these cures the working of divine agencies. Jaskowski shows\r\nthat in several instances the persons said to have found relief died\r\nshortly afterwards, and maintains that where cures actually occurred they\r\n“were not due to a miracle or any direct interference of God with the\r\nestablished order of things, but happened in a purely natural manner.” He\r\nquotes the late Professor Charcot, Dr. Forel, and other neuropathologists\r\nto establish the fact that hetero-suggestion emanating from a physician or\r\npriest, or auto-suggestion originating in the person’s own mind, may\r\noften be the most effective remedy for neurotic disorders of every kind.\r\nIn auto-suggestion the patient is possessed with the fixed idea that the\r\ndoing of a certain thing, which may be in itself absolutely indifferent,\r\nwill afford relief. As an example of this faith-cure Jaskowski refers to\r\nthe woman who was diseased with an issue of blood, and approaching Jesus\r\nsaid within herself: “If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.”\r\nThis is precisely the position taken by Jesus himself, who turned to the\r\nwoman and said: “Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee\r\nwhole.” Jaskowski also quotes the declaration of the evangelist referred\r\nto above, that in a certain place the people’s lack of faith prevented\r\nJesus from doing many wondrous works, and does not deny that on this\r\nprinciple, which is now recognized by the most eminent physicians, some\r\nfew of the hundreds of pilgrims may have been restored to health by\r\ntouching the holy coat of Trier; and there is no doubt that the popular\r\nbelief in Bishop Korum’s assertion that it is the same garment which Jesus\r\nwore and the woman touched, would greatly increase its healing efficacy\r\nthrough the force of auto-suggestion (see my article on “Recent\r\nRecrudescence of Superstition” in Appleton’s _Popular Science Monthly_ for\r\nOct. 1895, pp. 762-66).\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Bamberg in Bavaria has been stigmatized as a hypocrite\r\nbecause he sends the infirm of his flock on a pilgrimage to Lourdes or\r\nLaas or some other holy shrine, while he prefers for himself the profane\r\nwaters of Karlsbad or Kissingen. But in so doing he is not guilty of any\r\ninconsistency, since a journey to sacred places and contact with sacred\r\nrelics would not act upon him with the same force as upon the ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious masses of his diocese. His conduct only evinces his\r\ndisbelief in the supernatural character of the remedies he prescribes. The\r\ndistinguished French physician, Professor Charcot, as already mentioned,\r\nrecognized the curative power of faith under certain circumstances, and\r\noccasionally found it eminently successful in hysterical and other purely\r\nnervous affections. In some cases he did not hesitate to prescribe a\r\npilgrimage to the shrine of any saint for whom the patient may have had a\r\npeculiar reverence; but in no instance in his experience did faith or\r\nexorcism or hagiolatry heal an organic disease, set a dislocated joint or\r\nrestore an amputated limb. What Falstaff says of honour is equally true of\r\nfaith, it “hath no skill in surgery.”\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression, Père Bougeant’s theory of the\r\ndiabolical possession of pagans and unbaptized persons would provide for\r\ncomparatively few devils, and the gradual diffusion of Christianity would\r\nconstantly diminish the supply of human beings available as their proper\r\nhabitations. The ultimate conversion of the whole world and the custom of\r\nbaptizing infants as soon as they are born would, therefore, produce\r\nserious domiciliary destitution and distress among the evil spirits and\r\nset immense numbers of them hopelessly adrift as vagabonds, and thus\r\ncreate an extremely undesirable diabolical proletariat. This difficulty is\r\navoided by assuming that the vast majority of devils are incarnate in the\r\nbillions of beasts of all kinds, which dwell upon the earth or fly in the\r\nair or fill the waters of the rivers and the seas. This hypothesis, he\r\nadds, “enables me to ascribe to the lower animals thought, knowledge,\r\nfeeling, and a spiritual principle or soul without running counter to the\r\ntruths of religion. Indeed, so far from being astonished at their\r\nmanifestations of intelligence, foresight, memory and reason, I am rather\r\nsurprised that they do not display these qualities in a higher degree,\r\nsince their soul is probably far more perfect than ours. Their defects\r\nare, as I have discovered, owing to the fact that in brute as in us, the\r\nmind works through material organs, and inasmuch as these organs are\r\ngrosser and less perfect in the lower animals than in man, it follows that\r\ntheir exhibitions of intelligence, their thoughts and all their mental\r\noperations must be less perfect; and, if these proud spirits are conscious\r\nof their condition, how humiliating it must be for them to see themselves\r\nthus embruted! Whether they are conscious of it or not, this deep\r\ndegradation is the first act of God’s vengeance executed on his foes. It\r\nis a foretaste of hell.”\r\n\r\nOnly by such an assumption, as our author proceeds to show, is it possible\r\nto justify the ways of man to the lower animals and to reconcile his cruel\r\ntreatment of them with the goodness of an all-wise and all-powerful maker\r\nand ruler of the universe. For this reason, he goes on to explain, the\r\nChristian Church has never deemed it a duty to take the lower animals\r\nunder its protection or to inculcate ordinary natural kindness towards\r\nthem. Hence in countries, like Italy and Spain, where the influence of\r\nCatholicism has been supreme for centuries, not only are wild birds and\r\nbeasts of chase relentlessly slaughtered and exterminated, but even useful\r\ndomestic animals, asses, sumpter-mules and pack-horses, are subjected to a\r\nsupererogation of suffering at the hands of ruthless man. As the pious\r\nParsi conscientiously comes up to the help of Ahuramazda against the\r\nmalevolent Angrô-mainyush by killing as many as possible of the creatures\r\nwhich the latter has made, so the good Catholic becomes an efficient\r\nco-worker with God by maltreating brutes and thus aiding the Almighty in\r\npunishing the devils, of which they are the visible and bruisable forms.\r\nWhatever pain is inflicted is felt, not by the physical organism, but by\r\nthe animated spirit. It is the embodied demon that really suffers, howling\r\nin the beaten dog and squealing in the butchered pig.\r\n\r\nThere are doubtless many persons of tender susceptibilities, who cannot\r\nbear to think that the animals, whose daily companionship we enjoy, the\r\nparrot we feed with sugar, the pretty pug we caress and the noble horse,\r\nwhich ministers to our comfort and convenience, are nothing but devils\r\npredestined to everlasting torture. But these purely sentimental\r\nconsiderations are of no weight in the scale of reason. “What matters it,”\r\nreplies the Jesuit Father, “whether it is a devil or another kind of\r\ncreature that is in our service or contributes to our amusement? For my\r\npart, this idea pleases rather than repels me; and I recognize with\r\ngratitude the beneficence of the Creator in having provided me with so\r\nmany little devils for my use and entertainment. If it be said that these\r\npoor creatures, which we have learned to love and so fondly cherish, are\r\nfore-ordained to eternal torments, I can only adore the decrees of God,\r\nbut do not hold myself responsible for the terrible sentence; I leave the\r\nexecution of the dread decision to the sovereign judge and continue to\r\nlive with my little devils, as I live pleasantly with a multitude of\r\npersons, of whom, according to the teachings of our holy religion, the\r\ngreat majority will be damned.” The crafty disciple of Loyola, elusive of\r\ndisagreeable deductions, is content to accept the poodle in its phenomenal\r\nform and to make the most of it, without troubling himself about “des\r\nPudels Kern.”\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, he thinks, is amply illustrated and confirmed by an appeal\r\nto the consentient opinion of mankind or the argument from universal\r\nbelief, which has been so often and so effectively urged in proof of the\r\nexistence of God. If the maxim _universitas non delinquit_ has the same\r\nvalidity in the province of philosophy as in that of law, then we are\r\njustified in assuming that the whole human race cannot go wrong even in\r\npurely metaphysical speculation and that unanimity in error is a\r\npsychological impossibility. The criterion of truth, _quod semper, quod\r\nubique, quod ab omnibus_, by which the Roman hierarchy is willing to have\r\nits claims to ecclesiastical catholicity and doctrinal orthodoxy tested,\r\nis confined to Christendom in its application and does not consider the\r\nviews of persons outside of the body of believers. In the question under\r\ndiscussion the argument is not subject to such limitations, but gathers\r\ntestimony from all races and religions, showing that there is not a\r\ncivilized nation or savage tribe on the face of the earth, which does not\r\nregard or has not regarded the lower animals as embodiments of evil\r\nspirits and sought to propitiate them. That “the devil is an ass” is a\r\ntruth so palpable that it has passed into a proverb. Baal-zebub means\r\nfly-god; and the Christian Satan betrays his presence by the cloven foot\r\nof the goat or the solid hoof of the horse. In folk-lore, which is the\r\n_débris_ of exploded mythologies adrift on the stream of popular\r\ntradition, cats, dogs, otters, apes, ravens, blackcocks, capercailzies,\r\nrabbits, hedgehogs, wolves, were-wolves, foxes, polecats, swine, serpents,\r\ntoads, and countless varieties of insects, reptiles and vermin figure as\r\nincarnations and instruments of the devil; and Mephistopheles reveals\r\nhimself to Faust as\r\n\r\n  “Der Herr der Ratten und der Mäuse,\r\n   Der Fliegen, Frösche, Wanzen, Läuse.”\r\n\r\n  “The Lord of rats and of the mice,\r\n   Of flies and frogs, bed-bugs and lice.”\r\n\r\nThe worship of animals originates in the belief that they are embodiments\r\nof devils, so that zoölatry, which holds such a prominent place in\r\nprimitive religions, is only a specific form of demonolatry. The objection\r\nthat a flea or a fly, a mite or a mosquito is too small a creature to\r\nfurnish fit lodgment for a demon, Father Bougeant dismisses with an\r\nindulgent smile and disparaging shrug as implying a gross misconception of\r\nthe nature and properties of spirit, which is without extension or\r\ndimension and therefore capable of animating the most diminutive particle\r\nof organized matter. Large and little are purely relative terms. God, he\r\nsays, could have made man as small as the tiniest puceron without any\r\ndecrease of his spiritual powers. “It is, therefore, no more difficult to\r\nbelieve that a devil may be incorporated in the delicate body of a gnat\r\nthan in the huge bulk of an elephant.” The size of the physical\r\nhabitation, in which spirits take up their temporary abode, is a thing of\r\nno consequence. In fact, devils in the forms of gnats and tiny insects\r\nwere thought to be especially dangerous, since one might swallow them\r\nunawares and thus become diabolically possessed. The demon, liberated by\r\nthe death and dissolution of the insect, was supposed to make a tenement\r\nof the unfortunate person’s stomach, producing gripes and playing\r\nventriloquous tricks. Thus it is recorded in the _Dies Caniculuares_ of\r\nMajolus (Meyer: _Der Aberglaube des Mittelalters_, p. 296-7) that a young\r\nmaiden in the Erzgebirge near Joachimsthal, in 1559, swallowed a fly,\r\nwhile drinking beer. The evil spirit, incarnate in the fly, took\r\npossession of the maiden and began to speak out of her, thus attracting\r\ncrowds of people, who put questions to the devil and tried to drive him\r\nout by prayers, in which the unhappy girl sometimes joined, greatly to her\r\ndiscomfort, since the devil waxed exceeding wroth and unruly and caused\r\nher much suffering, whenever she uttered the name of Christ. Finally the\r\nparish priest had her brought into the church, where he succeeded with\r\nconsiderable difficulty in exorcising her. The stubborn demon resisted for\r\ntwo years all efforts to cast him out; he even tried to compromise with\r\nthe girl, promising to be content with a finger nail or a single hair of\r\nher head, but she declined all overtures, and he was at last expelled by\r\nmeans of a potent conjuration, which lasted from midnight till midday.\r\n\r\nAs the human soul is released by death, so the extinction of life in any\r\nanimal sets its devil free, who, instead of entering upon a spiritual\r\nstate of existence, goes into the egg or embryo of another animal and\r\nresumes his penal bondage to the flesh. “Thus a devil, after having been a\r\ncat or a goat, may pass, not by choice, but by constraint, into the embryo\r\nof a bird, a fish or a butterfly. Happy are those who make a lucky hit and\r\nbecome household pets, instead of beasts of burden or of slaughter. The\r\nlottery of destiny bars them the right of voluntary choosing.” The\r\ndoctrine of transmigration, continues our author, “which Pythagoras taught\r\nof yore and some Indian sages hold to-day, is untenable in its application\r\nto men and contrary to religion, but it fits admirably into the system\r\nalready set forth concerning the nature of beasts, and shocks neither our\r\nfaith nor our reason.” Furthermore, it explains why “all species of\r\nanimals produce many more eggs or embryos than are necessary to propagate\r\ntheir kind and to provide for a normal increase.” Of the millions of\r\ngerms, of which “great creating nature” is so prolific, comparatively few\r\never develop into living creatures; only those which are vivified by a\r\ndevil are evolved into complete organisms; the others perish. This seeming\r\nsuperfluity and waste can be most easily reconciled with the careful\r\neconomy and wise frugality of nature by viewing it as a manifestation of\r\nthe bountiful and beneficent providence of God in preventing “any lack of\r\noccupation or abode on the part of the devils,” which are being constantly\r\ndisembodied and re-embodied. “This accounts for the prodigious clouds of\r\nlocusts and countless hosts of caterpillars, which suddenly desolate our\r\nfields and gardens. The cause of these astonishing multiplications has\r\nbeen sought in cold, heat, rain and wind, but the real reason is that, at\r\nthe time of their appearance, extraordinary quantities of animals have\r\ndied or their embryos been destroyed, so that the devils that animated\r\nthem were compelled to avail themselves at once of whatever species they\r\nfound most ready to receive them, which would naturally be the\r\nsuperabundant eggs of insects.” The more profoundly this subject is\r\ninvestigated, he concludes, and the more light our observations and\r\nresearches throw upon it from all sides, the more probable does the\r\nhypothesis here suggested in explanation of the puzzling phenomena of\r\nanimal life and intelligence appear.\r\n\r\nFather Bougeant calls his lucubration “a new system of philosophy”; but\r\nthis is not strictly true. He has only given a fuller and more facetious\r\nexposition of a doctrine taught by many of the greatest lights of the\r\nCatholic Church, among others by Thomas Aquinas, whose authority as a\r\nthinker Pope Leo XIII. distinctly recognized and earnestly sought to\r\nrestore to its former prestige. Bougeant’s ingenious dissertation has a\r\nvein of irony or at least a strain of jocundity in it, approaching at\r\ntimes so perilously near the fatal brink of persiflage, that one cannot\r\nhelp surmising an intention to render the whole thing ridiculous in a\r\nwitty and underhand way eminently compatible with Jesuitical habits of\r\nmind; but whether serious or satirical, his treatise is an excellent\r\nexample and illustration of the kind of dialectic hair-splitting and\r\nsyllogistic rubbish, which passed for reasoning in the early and middle\r\nages of the Christian era, and which the greatest scholars and acutest\r\nintellects of those days fondly indulged in and seem to have been fully\r\nsatisfied with. Here, too, we come upon the metaphysical and theological\r\ngroundwork, upon which was reared by a strictly logical process a vast\r\nsuperstructure of ecclesiastical excommunication and criminal prosecution\r\nagainst bugs and beasts. He protests with never-tiring and needless\r\niteration his absolute devotion to the precepts of religion; indeed, like\r\nthe lady in the play, he “protests too much, methinks.” In all humbleness\r\nand submission he bows to the authority of the Church, and would not touch\r\nthe ark of the covenant even with the tip of his finger, but his easy\r\nacquiescence has an air of perfunctoriness, and in his assenting lips\r\nthere lurks a secret, semi-sarcastic leer, which casts suspicion on his\r\nwords and looks like poking fun at the principles he professes and turning\r\nthem into raillery.\r\n\r\nIndeed, such covert derision would have been a suitable way of ridiculing\r\nthe gross popular superstition of his time, which saw a diabolical\r\nincarnation in every unfamiliar form of animal life. During the latter\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century a Swiss naturalist named Thurneysser, who\r\nheld the position of physician in ordinary to the Elector Johann Georg von\r\nBrandenburg, kept some scorpions bottled in olive oil, which were feared\r\nby the common people as terrible devils endowed with magic power\r\n(_fürchterliche Zauberteufel_). Thurneysser presented also to Basel, his\r\nnative city, a large elk, which had been given to him by Prince Radziwil;\r\nbut the good Baselers looked upon the strange animal as a most dangerous\r\ndemon, and a pious old woman finally rid the town of the dreaded beast by\r\nfeeding it with an apple stuck full of broken needles.\r\n\r\nA distinguished Spanish theologian of the sixteenth century, Martin\r\nAzpilcueta, commonly known as Dr. Navarre, refers, in his work on\r\nexcommunication, to a case in which anathemas were fulminated against\r\ncertain large sea-creatures called terones, which infested the waters of\r\nSorrento and destroyed the nets of the fishermen. He speaks of them as\r\n“fish or cacodemons” (_pisces seu cacodemones_), and maintains that they\r\nare subject to anathematization, not as fish, but only as devils. In his\r\nFive Counsels and other tractates on this subject (Opera, Lyons, 1589;\r\nreprinted at Venice, 1601-2, and at Cologne, 1616) he often takes issue\r\nwith Chassenée on minor points, but the French jurist and the Spanish\r\ndivine agree on the main question.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be a matter of interest to add, that a German\r\nneuropathologist of our own day, Herr von Bodelschwingh, ascribes epilepsy\r\nto what he calls “demonic infection” due to the presence of the _bacillus\r\ninfernalis_ in the blood of those who are subject to this disease. The\r\nmicrobe, to which the jocose scientist has been pleased to give this name,\r\ndiffers from all other bacilli hitherto discovered in having two horns and\r\na tail, although the most powerful lenses have not yet revealed any traces\r\nof a cloven foot. An additional indication of its infernal qualities is\r\nthe fact that it liquefies the gelatine, with which it comes in contact,\r\nand turns it black, emitting at the same time a pestilential stench.\r\nDoubtless this discovery will be hailed by theologians as a striking\r\nconfirmation of divine revelation by modern science, proving that our\r\nforefathers were right in attributing the falling-sickness to diabolical\r\nagencies. We know now that it was a legion of _bacilli infernales_ which\r\nwent out of the tomb-haunting man into the Gadarene swine and drove them\r\ntumultuously over a precipice into the sea. In fact, who can tell what\r\nmicrobes really are! Père Bougeant would certainly have regarded them as\r\nnothing less than microscopic devils.\r\n\r\nThe Savoyan jurist, Gaspard Bailly, in the second part of the disquisition\r\nentitled _Traité des Monitoires_, already mentioned, treats “Of the\r\nExcellence of Monitories” and discusses the main points touching the\r\ncriminal prosecution and punishment of insects. He begins by saying that\r\n“one should not contemn monitories (a general term for anathemas, bans and\r\nexcommunications), seeing that they are matters of great importance,\r\ninasmuch as they bear with them the deadliest sword, wielded by our holy\r\nmother, the Church, to wit, the power of excommunication, which cutteth\r\nthe dry wood and the green, sparing neither the quick nor the dead, and\r\nsmiting not only rational beings, but turning its edge also against\r\nirrational creatures; since it hath been shown at sundry times and in\r\ndivers places, that worms and insects, which were devouring the fruits of\r\nthe earth, have been excommunicated and, in obedience to the commands of\r\nthe Church, have withdrawn from the cultivated fields to the places\r\nprescribed by the bishop who had been appointed to adjudge and to adjure\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nM. Bailly then cites numerous instances of this kind, in which a writer on\r\nlogic would find ample illustrations of the fallacy known as _post hoc,\r\nergo propter hoc_. Thus in the latter half of the fifteenth century,\r\nduring the reign of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, a plague of\r\nlocusts threatened the province of Mantua in Northern Italy with famine,\r\nbut were dispersed by excommunication. He quotes some florid lines from\r\nthe poet Altiat descriptive of these devastating swarms, which “came,\r\nafter so many other woes, under the leadership of Eurus (_i.e._ brought by\r\nthe east wind), more destructive than the hordes of Attila or the camps of\r\nCorsicans, devouring the hay, the millet and the corn, and leaving only\r\nvain wishes, where the hopes of August stood.” Again in 1541, a cloud of\r\nlocusts fell upon Lombardy, and by destroying the crops, caused many\r\npersons to perish with hunger. These insects “were as long as a man’s\r\nfinger, with large heads and bellies filled with vileness; and when dead\r\nthey infected the air and gave forth a stench, which even carrion kites\r\nand carnivorous beasts could not endure.” Another instance is given, in\r\nwhich swarms of four-winged insects came from Tartary, identified in the\r\npopular mind with Tartarus, obscuring the sun in their flight and covering\r\nthe plains of Poland a cubit deep. In the year 1338, on St. Bartholomew’s\r\nDay, these creatures began to devastate the region round Botzen in the\r\nTyrol, consuming the crops and laying eggs and leaving a numerous progeny,\r\nwhich seemed destined to continue the work of destruction indefinitely. A\r\nprosecution was therefore instituted against them before the\r\necclesiastical court at Kaltern, a large market-town about ten miles south\r\nof Botzen, then as now famous for its wines, and the parish priest\r\ninstructed to proceed against them with the sentence of excommunication in\r\naccordance with the verdict of the tribunal. This he did by the solemn\r\nceremony of “inch of candle,” and anathematized them “in the name of the\r\nBlessed Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost.” Owing to the sins of the\r\npeople and their remissness in the matter of tithes the devouring insects\r\nresisted for a time the power of the Church, but finally disappeared.\r\nUnder the reign of Lotharius II., early in the twelfth century, enormous\r\nquantities of locusts, “having six wings with two teeth harder than flint”\r\nand “darkening the sky and whitening the air like a snowstorm,” laid waste\r\nthe most fertile provinces of France. Many of them perished in the rivers\r\nand the sea, and being washed ashore sent forth a putrescent smell and\r\nproduced a fearful pestilence. Precisely the same phenomenon, with like\r\ndisastrous results, is described by St. Augustine in the last book of _De\r\nCivitate Dei_ as having occurred in Africa and caused the death of 800,000\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases adduced there is no evidence that the Church\r\nintervened at all with its fulminations, and, even when the anathema was\r\npronounced, the insects appear to have departed of their own free-will\r\nafter having eaten up every green thing and reduced the inhabitants to\r\nthe verge of starvation; and yet M. Bailly, supposed to be a man of\r\njudicial mind, disciplined by study, accustomed to reason and to know what\r\nsound reasoning is, goes on giving accounts of such scourges, as though\r\nthey proved in some mysterious way the effectiveness of ecclesiastical\r\nexcommunications and formed a cumulative argument in support of such\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nThe most important portion of M. Bailly’s work is that in which he shows\r\nhow actions of this kind should be brought and conducted, with specimens\r\nof plaints, pleas, replications, rejoinders, and decisions. First in order\r\ncomes the petition of the inhabitants seeking redress (_requeste des\r\nhabitans_), which is followed in regular succession by the declaration or\r\nplea of the inhabitants (_plaidoyer des habitans_), the defensive\r\nallegation or plea for the insects (_plaidoyer pour les insectes_), the\r\nreplication of the inhabitants (_réplique des habitans_), the rejoinder of\r\nthe defendant (_réplique du defendeur_), the conclusions of the bishop’s\r\nproctor (_conclusions du procureur episcopal_), and the sentence of the\r\necclesiastical judge (_sentence du juge d’église_), which is solemnly\r\npronounced in Latin. The pleadings on both sides are delivered in French\r\nand richly interlarded with classical allusions and Latin quotations,\r\nbeing even more heavily weighted with the spoils of erudition than the set\r\nspeech of a member of the British Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe following abridgment of the plea, in which the prosecuting attorney\r\nsets forth the cause of complaint, is a fair specimen of the forensic\r\neloquence displayed on such occasions:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, these poor people on their knees and with tearful eyes, appeal\r\nto your sense of justice, as the inhabitants of the islands Majorica and\r\nMinorica formerly sent an embassy to Augustus Cæsar, praying him for a\r\ncohort of soldiers to exterminate the rabbits, which were burrowing in\r\ntheir fields and consuming their crops. In the power of excommunication\r\nyou have a weapon more effective than any wielded by that emperor to save\r\nthese poor suppliants from impending famine produced by the ravages of\r\nlittle beasts, which spare neither the corn nor the vines, ravages like\r\nthose of the boar that laid waste the environs of Calydon, as related by\r\nHomer in the first book of the _Iliad_, or those of the foxes sent by\r\nThemis to Thebes, which destroyed the fruits of the earth and the cattle\r\nand assailed even the husbandmen themselves. You know how great are the\r\nevils which famine brings with it, and you have too much kindness and\r\ncompassion to permit my clients to be involved in such distress, thus\r\nconstraining them to perpetrate cruel and unlawful deeds; _nec enim\r\nrationem patitur, nec ulla aequitate mitigatur, nec prece ulla flectitur\r\nesuriens populus_: for a starving people is not amenable to reason, nor\r\ntempered by equity, nor moved by any prayer. Witness the mothers, of whom\r\nit is recorded in the Fourth Book of the Kings, that they ate their own\r\nchildren, the one saying to the other: ‘Give thy son that we may eat him\r\nto-day, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’” The advocate then discourses at\r\nlength of the horrors of hunger and its disastrous effects upon the\r\nindividual and the community, lugging in what Milton calls a “horse-load\r\nof citations” from Arianus Marcellinus, Ovid and other Latin prosaists and\r\npoets, introduces an utterly irrelevant allusion to Joshua and the crafty\r\nGibeonites, and concludes as follows: “The full reports received as the\r\nresult of an examination of the fields, made at your command, suffice for\r\nyour information concerning the damage done by these animals. It remains,\r\ntherefore, after complying with the usual forms, only to adjudicate upon\r\nthe case in accordance with the facts stated in the Petition of the\r\nPlaintiffs, which is right and reasonable, and, to this effect, to enjoin\r\nthese animals from continuing their devastations, ordering them to quit\r\nthe aforesaid fields and to withdraw to the place assigned them,\r\npronouncing the necessary anathemas and execrations prescribed by our Holy\r\nMother, the Church, for which your petitioners do ever pray.”\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether any speaking for Buncombe in the halls of Congress\r\nor any spouting of an ignorant bumpkin in the moot-court of an American\r\nlaw-school ever produced such a rhetorical hotchpotch of “matter and\r\nimpertinency mixed” as the earnest plea, of which the above is a brief\r\nabstract.\r\n\r\nRather more to the point, but equally overburdened with legal lore and\r\nliterary pedantry, is the rejoinder of the counsel for the insects:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, inasmuch as you have chosen me to defend these little beasts\r\n(_bestioles_), I shall, an it please you, endeavour to right them and to\r\nshow that the manner of proceeding against them is invalid and void. I\r\nconfess that I am greatly astonished at the treatment they have been\r\nsubjected to and at the charges brought against them, as though they had\r\ncommitted some crime. Thus information has been procured touching the\r\ndamage said to have been done by them; they have been summoned to appear\r\nbefore this court to answer for their conduct, and, since they are\r\nnotoriously dumb, the judge, wishing that they should not suffer wrong on\r\naccount of this defect, has appointed an advocate to speak in their behalf\r\nand to set forth in conformity with right and justice the reasons, which\r\nthey themselves are unable to allege.\r\n\r\n“Since you have permitted me to appear in defence of these poor animals, I\r\nwill state, in the first place, that the summons served on them is null\r\nand void, having been issued against beasts, which cannot and ought not to\r\nbe cited before this judgment seat, inasmuch as such a procedure implies\r\nthat the parties summoned are endowed with reason and volition and are\r\ntherefore capable of committing crime. That this is not the case with\r\nthese creatures is clear from the paragraph _Si quadrupes_, etc., in the\r\nfirst book of the Pandects, where we find these words: _Nec enim potest\r\nanimal injuriam fecisse, quod sensu caret_.\r\n\r\n“The second ground, on which I base the defence of my clients, is that no\r\none can be judicially summoned without cause, and whoever has had such a\r\nsummons served renders himself liable to the penalty prescribed by the\r\nstatute _De poen. tem. litig._ As regards these animals there is no _causa\r\njusta litigandi_; they are not bound in any manner, _non tenentur ex\r\ncontractu_, being incompetent to make contracts or to enter into any\r\ncompact or covenant whatsoever, _neque ex quasi contractu_, _neque ex\r\nstipulatione_, _neque ex pacto_, and still less _ex delicto seu quasi_,\r\ncan there be any question of a delict or any semblance thereof, since, as\r\nhas just been shown, the rational faculties essential to the capability of\r\ncommitting criminal actions are wanting.\r\n\r\n“Furthermore, it is illicit to do that which is nugatory and of non-effect\r\n(_qui ne porte coup_); in this respect justice is like nature, which, as\r\nthe philosopher affirms, does nothing _mal à propos_ or in vain: _Deus\r\nenim et Natura nihil operantur frustra_. Now I leave it to you to decide\r\nwhether anything could be more futile than to summon these irrational\r\ncreatures, which can neither speak for themselves, nor appoint proxies to\r\ndefend their cause; still less are they able to present memorials stating\r\ngrounds of their justification. If then, as I have shown, the summons,\r\nwhich is the basis of all judicial action, is null and void, the\r\nproceedings dependent upon it will not be able to stand: _cum enim\r\nprincipalis causa non consistat, neque ea quae consequuntur locum\r\nhabent_.”\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the defence rests his argument, of which the extract just\r\ngiven may suffice as a sample, upon the irrationality and consequent\r\nirresponsibility of his clients. For this reason he maintains that the\r\njudge cannot appoint a procurator to represent them, and cites legal\r\nauthorities to show that the incompetency of the principal implies the\r\nincompetency of the proxy, in conformity with the maxim: _quod directe\r\nfieri prohibetur, per indirectum concedi non debet_. In like manner the\r\ninvalidity of the summons bars any charge of contempt of court and\r\ncondemnation for contumacy. Furthermore, the very nature of\r\nexcommunication is such that it cannot be pronounced against them, since\r\nit is defined as _extra ecclesiam positio, vel è qualibet communione, vel\r\nquolibet legitimo actu separatio_. But these animals cannot be expelled\r\nfrom the Church, because they are not members of it and do not fall under\r\nits jurisdiction, as the apostle Paul says: “Ye judge them that are\r\nwithin and not them also that are without.” _Excommunicatio afficit\r\nanimam, non corpus, nisi per quandam consequentiam, cujus medicina est._\r\nThe animal soul, not being immortal, cannot be affected by such sentence,\r\nwhich involves the loss of eternal salvation (_quae vergit in dispendium\r\naeternae salutis_).\r\n\r\nA still more important consideration is that these insects are only\r\nexercising an innate right conferred upon them at their creation, when God\r\nexpressly gave them “every green herb for meat,” a right which cannot be\r\ncurtailed or abrogated, simply because it may be offensive to man. In\r\nsupport of this view he quotes passages from Cicero’s treatise _De\r\nOfficiis_, the Epistle of Jude and the works of Thomas Aquinas. Finally,\r\nhe maintains that his clients are agents of the Almighty sent to punish us\r\nfor our sins, and to hurl anathemas against them would be to fight against\r\nGod (_s’en prendre à Dieu_), who has said: “I will send wild beasts among\r\nyou, which shall destroy you and your cattle and make you few in number.”\r\nThat all flesh has corrupted its way upon the earth, he thinks is as true\r\nnow as before the deluge, and cites about a dozen lines from the\r\n_Metamorphoses_ of Ovid in confirmation of this fact. In conclusion he\r\ndemands the acquittal of the defendants and their exemption from all\r\nfurther prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe prosecuting attorney in his replication answers these objections in\r\nregular order, showing, in the first place, that, while the law may not\r\npunish an irrational creature for a crime already committed, it may\r\nintervene, as in the case of an insane person, to prevent the commission\r\nof a crime by putting the madman in a strait-jacket or throwing him into\r\nprison. He elucidates this principle by a rather far-fetched illustration\r\nfrom the legal enactments concerning betrothal and breach of promise of\r\nmarriage. “It follows then inferentially that the aforesaid animals can be\r\nproperly summoned to appear and that the summons is valid, inasmuch as\r\nthis is done in order to prevent them from causing damage henceforth\r\n(_d’ores en avant_) and only incidentally to punish them for injuries\r\nalready inflicted.”\r\n\r\n“To affirm that such animals cannot be anathematized and excommunicated is\r\nto doubt the authority conferred by God upon his dear spouse, the Church,\r\nwhom he has made the sovereign of the whole world, having, in the words of\r\nthe Psalmist, put all things under her feet, all sheep and oxen, the\r\nbeasts of the field, the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea and\r\nwhatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. Guided by the Holy\r\nSpirit she does nothing unwisely; and if there is anything in which she\r\nshould show forth her power it is in protecting and preserving the most\r\nperfect work of her heavenly husband, to wit, man, who was made in the\r\ndivine image and likeness.” The orator then dilates on the grandeur and\r\nglory of man and interlards his harangue with quotations from sacred and\r\nprofane writers, Moses, Paul, Pliny, Ovid, Silius Italicus and Pico di\r\nMirandola, and declares that nothing could be more absurd than to deprive\r\nsuch a being of the fruits of the earth for the sake of “vile and paltry\r\nvermin.” In reply to the statement of Thomas Aquinas, quoted by the\r\ncounsel for the defence, that it is futile to curse animals as such, the\r\nplaintiffs’ advocate says that they are not viewed merely as animals, but\r\nas creatures doing harm to man by eating and wasting the products of the\r\nsoil designed for human sustenance; in other words he ascribes to them a\r\ncertain diabolical character. “But why dwell upon this point, since\r\nbesides the instances recorded in Holy Writ, in which God curses inanimate\r\nthings and irrational creatures, we have an infinite number of examples of\r\nholy men, who have excommunicated noxious animals. It will suffice to\r\nmention one familiar to us all and constantly before our eyes in the town\r\nof Aix, where St. Hugon, Bishop of Grenoble, excommunicated the serpents,\r\nwhich infested the warm baths and killed many of the inhabitants by biting\r\nthem. Now it is well known, that if the serpents in that place or in the\r\nimmediate vicinity bite any one, the bite is no longer fatal. The venom of\r\nthe reptile was stayed and annulled by virtue of the excommunication, so\r\nthat no hurt ensues from the bite, although the bite of the same kind of\r\nserpent outside of the region affected by the ban, is followed by death.”\r\n\r\nThat serpents and other poisonous reptiles could be deprived of their\r\nvenom by enchantment and thus rendered harmless is in accord with the\r\nteachings of the Bible. Thus we read in Ecclesiastes (x. 11): “Surely the\r\nserpent will bite without enchantment,” _i.e._ unless it be enchanted and\r\nits bite disenvenomed. A curious superstition concerning the adder is\r\nreferred to in the Psalms (lviii. 4, 5), where the wicked are said to be\r\n“like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; which will not hearken to the\r\nvoice of charmers, charming never so wisely.” The Lord is also represented\r\nby Jeremiah (viii. 17) as threatening to “send serpents, cockatrices,\r\namong you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you.” It does\r\nnot seem to have occurred to the prosecutor that the defendants might be\r\nlocusts, which would not be excommunicated.\r\n\r\nThe objection that God has sent these insects as a scourge, and that to\r\nanathematize them would be to fight against him, is met by saying that to\r\nhave recourse to the offices of the Church is an act of religion, which\r\ndoes not resist, but humbly recognizes the divine will and makes use of\r\nthe means appointed for averting the divine wrath and securing the divine\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nAfter the advocates had finished their pleadings, the case was summed up\r\nby the episcopal procurator substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n“The arguments offered by the counsel for the defence against the\r\nproceedings instituted by the inhabitants as complainants are worthy of\r\ncareful consideration and deserve to be examined soberly and maturely,\r\nbecause the bolt of excommunication should not be hurled recklessly and at\r\nrandom (_à la volée_), being a weapon of such peculiar energy and activity\r\nthat, if it fails to strike the object against which it is hurled, it\r\nreturns to smite him, who hurled it.” [This notion that an anathema is a\r\ndangerous missile to him who hurls it unlawfully or for an unjust purpose,\r\nretroacting like an Australian boomerang, survives in the homely proverb:\r\n“Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.”] The bishop’s proctor reviews\r\nthe speeches of the lawyers, but seems to have his brains somewhat muddled\r\nby them. “It is truly a deep sea,” he says, “in which it is impossible to\r\ntouch bottom. We cannot tell why God has sent these animals to devour the\r\nfruits of the earth; this is for us a sealed book (_lettres closes_).” He\r\nsuggests it may be “because the people turn a deaf ear to the poor begging\r\nat their doors,” and goes off into a long eulogy on the beauty of charity,\r\nwith an anthology of extracts from various writers in praise of\r\nalms-giving, among which is one from Eusebius descriptive of hell as a\r\ncold region, where the wailing and gnashing of teeth are attributed to\r\nthe torments of eternal frost instead of everlasting fire (_liberaberis ab\r\nillo frigore, in quo erit fletus et stridor dentium_). Again, the plague\r\nof insects may be due to irreverence shown in the churches, which, he\r\ndeclares, have been changed from the house of God into houses of\r\nassignation. On this point he quotes from Tertullian, Augustine, and Numa\r\nPompilius, and concludes by recommending that sentence of excommunication\r\nbe pronounced upon the insects, and that the prayers and penances,\r\ncustomary in such cases, be imposed upon the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAfter this discourse, which reads more like a homily from the pulpit than\r\na plea at the bar and in the mouth of the bishop’s proctor is simply an\r\n_oratio pro domo_, the official gave judgment in favour of the plaintiffs.\r\nThe sentence, which was pronounced in Latin befitting the dignity and\r\nsolemnity of the occasion, condemned the defendants to vacate the premises\r\nwithin six days on pain of anathema.\r\n\r\nThe official begins by stating the case as that of “The People _versus_\r\nLocusts,” declaring that the guilt of the accused has been clearly proved\r\n“by the testimony of worthy witnesses and, as it were, by public rumour,”\r\nand inasmuch as the people have humbled themselves before God and\r\nsupplicated the Church to succour them in their distress, it is not\r\nfitting to refuse them help and solace. “Walking in the footsteps of the\r\nfathers, sitting on the judgment-seat, having the fear of God before our\r\neyes and confiding in his mercy, relying on the counsel of experts, we\r\npronounce and publish our sentence as follows:\r\n\r\n“In the name and by virtue of God, the omnipotent, Father, Son and Holy\r\nSpirit, and of Mary, the most blessed Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, and\r\nby the authority of the holy apostles Peter and Paul, as well as by that\r\nwhich has made us a functionary in this case, we admonish by these\r\npresents the aforesaid locusts and grasshoppers and other animals by\r\nwhatsoever name they may be called, under pain of malediction and anathema\r\nto depart from the vineyards and fields of this district within six days\r\nfrom the publication of this sentence and to do no further damage there or\r\nelsewhere.” If, on the expiration of this period, the animals have refused\r\nto obey this injunction, then they are to be anathematized and accursed,\r\nand the inhabitants of all classes are to beseech “Almighty God, the\r\ndispenser of all good gifts and the dispeller of all evils,” to deliver\r\nthem from so great a calamity, not forgetting to join with devout\r\nsupplications the performance of all good works and especially “the\r\npayment of tithes without fraud according to the approved custom of the\r\nparish, and to abstain from blasphemies and such other sins as are of a\r\npublic and particularly offensive character.” (_Vide_ Appendix B.)\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether one could find in the ponderous tomes of scholastic\r\ndivinity anything surpassing in comical _non sequiturs_ and sheer nonsense\r\nthe forensic eloquence of eminent lawyers as transmitted to us in the\r\nrecords of legal proceedings of this kind. Although the counsel for the\r\ndefendants, as we have seen, ventured to question the propriety and\r\nvalidity of such prosecutions, his scepticism does not seem to have been\r\ntaken seriously, but was evidently smiled at as the trick of a pettifogger\r\nbound to use every artifice to clear his clients. In the writings of\r\nmediæval jurisprudents the right and fitness of inflicting judicial\r\npunishment upon animals appear to have been generally admitted. Thus Guy\r\nPape, in his _Decisions of the Parliament of Grenoble_ (Qu. 238), raises\r\nthe query, whether a brute beast, if it commit a crime, as pigs sometimes\r\ndo in devouring children, ought to suffer death, and answers the question\r\nunhesitatingly in the affirmative: “_si animal brutum delinquat, sicut\r\nquandoque faciunt porci qui comedunt pueros, an debeat mori? Dico quod\r\nsic._” Jean Duret, in his elaborate Treatise on Pains and Penalties\r\n(_Traicté des Peines et des Amendes_, p. 250; cf. _Thémis Jurisconsulte_,\r\nVIII. p. 57), takes the same view, declaring that “if beasts not only\r\nwound, but kill and eat any person, as experience has shown to happen\r\nfrequently in cases of little children being eaten by pigs, they should\r\npay the forfeit of their lives and be condemned to be hanged and\r\nstrangled, in order to efface the memory of the enormity of the deed.” The\r\ndistinguished Belgian jurist, Jodocus Damhouder, discusses this question\r\nin his _Rerum Criminalium Praxis_ (cap. CXLII.), and holds that the beast\r\nis punishable, if it commits the crime through natural malice, and not\r\nthrough the instigation of others, but that the owner can redeem it by\r\npaying for the damage done; nevertheless he is not permitted to keep\r\nferocious or malicious beasts and let them run at large, so as to be a\r\nconstant peril to the community. Occasionally a more enlightened jurist\r\nhad the common-sense and courage to protest against such perversions and\r\ntravesties of justice. Thus Pierre Ayrault, _lieutenant-criminel au siége\r\nprésidial d’Angers_, published at Angers, in 1591, a small quarto\r\nentitled: _Des Procez faicts au Cadaver, aux Cendres, à la Mémoire, aux\r\nBestes brutes, aux Choses inanimées et aux Contumax_, in which he argued\r\nthat corpses, the ashes and the memory of the dead, brute beasts and\r\ninanimate things are not legal persons (_legales homines_) and therefore\r\ndo not come within the jurisdiction of a court. Curiously enough a case\r\nsomewhat analogous to those discussed by Pierre Ayrault was adjudicated\r\nupon only a few years ago. A Frenchman bequeathed his property to his own\r\ncorpse, in behalf of which his entire estate was to be administered, the\r\nincome to be expended for the preservation of his mortal remains and the\r\nadornment of the magnificent mausoleum in which they were sepulchred. His\r\nheirs-at-law contested the will, which was declared null and void by the\r\ncourt on the ground that “a subject deprived of individuality or of civil\r\npersonality” could not inherit. The same principle would apply to the\r\ninfliction of penalties upon such subjects. The only kind of legacy that\r\nwill cause a man’s memory to be cherished is the form of bequest which\r\nmakes the public weal his legatee. The Chinese still hold to the barbarous\r\ncustom of bringing corpses to trial and passing sentence upon them. On the\r\n6th of August, 1888, the cadaver of a salt-smuggler, who was wounded in\r\nthe capture and died in prison, was brought before the criminal court in\r\nShanghai and condemned to be beheaded. This sentence was carried out by\r\nthe proper officers on the place of execution outside of the west gate of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nFelix Hemmerlein, better known as Malleolus, a distinguished doctor of\r\ncanon law and proto-martyr of religious reform in Switzerland, states in\r\nhis _Tractatus de Exorcismis_, that in the fourteenth century the peasants\r\nof the Electorate of Mayence brought a complaint against some Spanish\r\nflies, which were accordingly cited to appear at a specified time and\r\nanswer for their conduct; but “in consideration of their small size and\r\nthe fact that they had not yet reached their majority,” the judge\r\nappointed for them a curator, who “defended them with great dignity”; and,\r\nalthough he was unable to prevent the banishment of his wards, he obtained\r\nfor them the use of a piece of land, to which they were permitted\r\npeaceably to retire. How they were induced to go into this insect\r\nreservation and to remain there we are not informed. The Church, as\r\nalready stated, claimed to possess the power of effecting the desired\r\nmigration by means of her ban. If the insects disappeared, she received\r\nfull credit for accomplishing it; if not, the failure was due to the sins\r\nof the people; in either case the prestige of the Church was preserved and\r\nher authority left unimpaired.\r\n\r\nIn 1519, the commune of Stelvio, in Western Tyrol, instituted criminal\r\nproceedings against the moles or field-mice,[3] which damaged the crops\r\n“by burrowing and throwing up the earth, so that neither grass nor green\r\nthing could grow.” But “in order that the said mice may be able to show\r\ncause for their conduct by pleading their exigencies and distress,” a\r\nprocurator, Hans Grinebner by name, was charged with their defence, “to\r\nthe end that they may have nothing to complain of in these proceedings.”\r\nSchwarz Mining was the prosecuting attorney, and a long list of witnesses\r\nis given, who testified that the serious injury done by these creatures\r\nrendered it quite impossible for tenants to pay their rents. The counsel\r\nfor the defendants urged in favour of his clients the many benefits which\r\nthey conferred upon the community, and especially upon the agricultural\r\nclass by destroying noxious insects and larvæ and by stirring up and\r\nenriching the soil, and concluded by expressing the hope that, if they\r\nshould be sentenced to depart, some other suitable place of abode might be\r\nassigned to them. He demanded, furthermore, that they should be provided\r\nwith a safe conduct securing them against harm or annoyance from dog, cat\r\nor other foe. The judge recognized the reasonableness of the latter\r\nrequest, in its application to the weaker and more defenceless of the\r\nculprits, and mitigated the sentence of perpetual banishment by ordering\r\nthat “a free safe-conduct and an additional respite of fourteen days be\r\ngranted to all those which are with young and to such as are yet in their\r\ninfancy; but on the expiration of this reprieve each and every must be\r\ngone, irrespective of age or previous condition of pregnancy.” (_Vide_\r\nAppendix C.)\r\n\r\nAn old Swiss chronicler named Schilling gives a full account of the\r\nprosecution and anathematization of a species of vermin called inger,\r\nwhich seems to have been a coleopterous insect of the genus Brychus and\r\nvery destructive to the crops. The case occurred in 1478 and the trial was\r\nconducted before the Bishop of Lausanne by the authority and under the\r\njurisdiction of Berne. The first document recorded is a long and earnest\r\ndeclaration and admonition delivered from the pulpit by a Bernese\r\nparish-priest, Bernhard Schmid, who begins by stating that his “dearly\r\nbeloved” are doubtless aware of the serious injury done by the inger and\r\nof the suffering which they have caused. The Leutpriester, as he is\r\ntermed, gives a brief history of the matter and of the measures taken to\r\nprocure relief. The mayor and common council of Berne were besought in\r\ntheir wisdom to devise some means of staying the plague, and after much\r\nearnest deliberation they held counsel with the Bishop of Lausanne, who\r\n“with fatherly feeling took to heart so great affliction and harm” and by\r\nan episcopal mandate enjoined the inger from committing further\r\ndepredations. After exhorting the people to entreat God by “a common\r\nprayer from house to house” to remove the scourge, he proceeds to warn and\r\nthreaten the vermin in the following manner: “Thou irrational and\r\nimperfect creature, the inger, called imperfect because there was none of\r\nthy species in Noah’s ark at the time of the great bane and ruin of the\r\ndeluge, thou art now come in numerous bands and hast done immense damage\r\nin the ground and above the ground to the perceptible diminution of food\r\nfor men and animals; and to the end that such things may cease, my\r\ngracious Lord and Bishop of Lausanne has commanded me in his name to\r\nadmonish you to withdraw and to abstain; therefore by his command and in\r\nhis name and also by virtue of the high and holy trinity and through the\r\nmerits of the Redeemer of mankind, our Saviour Jesus Christ, and in virtue\r\nof and obedience to the Holy Church, I do command and admonish you, each\r\nand all, to depart within the next six days from all places where you have\r\nsecretly or openly done or might still do damage, also to depart from all\r\nfields, meadows, gardens, pastures, trees, herbs, and spots, where things\r\nnutritious to men and to beasts spring up and grow, and to betake\r\nyourselves to the spots and places, where you and your bands shall not be\r\nable to do any harm secretly or openly to the fruits and aliments\r\nnourishing to men and beasts. In case, however, you do not heed this\r\nadmonition or obey this command, and think you have some reason for not\r\ncomplying with them, I admonish, notify and summon you in virtue of and\r\nobedience to the Holy Church to appear on the sixth day after this\r\nexecution at precisely one o’clock after midday at Wifflisburg, there to\r\njustify yourselves or to answer for your conduct through your advocate\r\nbefore His Grace the Bishop of Lausanne or his vicar and deputy. Thereupon\r\nmy Lord of Lausanne or his deputy will proceed against you according to\r\nthe rules of justice with curses and other exorcisms, as is proper in such\r\ncases in accordance with legal form and established practice.” The priest\r\nthen exhorts his “dear children” devoutly to beg and to pray on their\r\nknees with Paternosters and Ave Marias to the praise and honour of the\r\nhigh and holy trinity, and to invoke and crave the divine mercy and help\r\nin order that the inger may be driven away. (_Vide_ Appendix D.)\r\n\r\nThere is no further record of proceedings at this time, and it is highly\r\nprobable that the detection of some technical error rendered it necessary\r\nto postpone the case, since this pettifogger’s trick was almost always\r\nresorted to and proved generally successful in procuring an adjournment.\r\nAt any rate either this or a precisely similar trial occurred in the\r\nfollowing year. Early in May 1479, the mayor and common council of Berne\r\nsent copies of the monitorium and citation issued by the Bishop of\r\nLausanne to their representative for distribution among the priests of the\r\nafflicted parishes, in order that it might be promulgated from their\r\nrespective pulpits and thus brought to the knowledge of the delinquents.\r\nAbout a week later, on May 15, the same authorities sent also a letter to\r\nthe Bishop of Lausanne asking for new instructions in the matter, as they\r\nwere not certain how they should proceed, urging that immediate steps\r\nshould be taken, as the further delay would be “utterly intolerable.” This\r\nimpatience would seem to imply that the anathema had been hanging fire for\r\nsome time and that the prosecution was identical with that of the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nThe appointed term having elapsed and the inger still persisting in their\r\nobduracy, the mayor and common council of Berne issued the following\r\ndocument conferring plenipotentiary power of attorney on Thüring Fricker\r\nto prosecute the case: “We, the mayor, council and commune of the city of\r\nBerne, to all those of the bishopric of Lausanne, who see, read, or hear\r\nthis letter. We make known that after mature deliberation we have\r\nappointed, chosen and deputed and by virtue of the present letter do\r\nappoint, choose and depute the excellent Thüring Fricker, doctor of the\r\nliberal arts and of laws, our now chancellor, to be our legal delegate and\r\nagent and that of our commune, as well as of all the lands and places of\r\nthe bishopric of Lausanne, which are directly or indirectly subject and\r\nappurtenant to us and of which a complete list is herein contained. And\r\nindeed he has assumed this general and special attorneyship, whereof the\r\none shall not be prejudicial to the other, in the case which we have\r\nundertaken and prosecute and have determined to prosecute before the court\r\nof the right reverend in Christ Benedict de Montferrand, Bishop of\r\nLausanne, Count and our most worthy Superior, against the noxious host of\r\nthe inger (_brucorum_), which creeping secretly in the earth devastate the\r\nfields, meadows and all kinds of grain, whereby with grievous wrong they\r\ndo detriment to the ever-living God, to whom the tithes belong, and to\r\nmen, who are nourished therewith and owe obedience to him. In this cause\r\nhe shall act in our stead, and in the name of all of us collectively and\r\nseverally shall plead, demur, reply, prove by witnesses, hear judgment or\r\njudgments, appoint other defenders and in general and specially do each\r\nand every thing which the importance of the cause may demand and which we\r\nourselves in case of our presence would be able to do. We solemnly promise\r\nin good faith that all and the whole of what may be transacted, performed,\r\nprovided, pledged, and ordained in this cause by our aforesaid attorney or\r\nby the proxy appointed by him shall be firmly and gratefully observed by\r\nus, with the express renunciation of each and every thing that might\r\neither by right or actually, in any wise, either wholly or partially\r\nimpair, weaken or assail our ordainment, conclusion and determination,\r\nalso over against any reservation of right, which permits a general\r\nrenunciation, even if no special reservation has preceded, with the\r\nexclusion of every fraud and every deceit. In corroboration and\r\nconfirmation of the aforesaid we ratify this letter with the warranty of\r\nour seal. Given on the twenty-second of May 1479.”\r\n\r\nThe trial began a couple of days later and was conducted with less “of the\r\nlaw’s delay” than usual, inasmuch as it ended on the twenty-ninth day of\r\nthe same month. The defender of the insects was a certain Jean Perrodet of\r\nFreiburg, who according to all accounts was a very inefficient advocate\r\nand does not appear to have contested the case with the ability and energy\r\nwhich the interests of his clients required. The sentence of the court\r\nwith the appended anathema of the bishop was as follows: “Ye accursed\r\nuncleanness of the inger, which shall not be called animals nor mentioned\r\nas such, ye have been heretofore by virtue of the appeal and admonition of\r\nour Lord of Lausanne enjoined to withdraw from all fields, grounds and\r\nestates of the bishopric of Lausanne, or within the next six days to\r\nappear at Lausanne, through your proctor, to set forth and to hear the\r\ncause of your procedure, and to act with just judgment either for or\r\nagainst you, pursuant to the said citation. Thereupon our gracious Lords\r\nof Berne solicited by their mandate such a day in court at Lausanne, and\r\nthere before the tribunal renewed their plaint in their name and in that\r\nof all the provinces of the said bishopric, and your reply thereto through\r\nyour proctor has been fully heard, and the legal terms have been justly\r\nobserved by both parties, and a lawful decision pronounced word for word\r\nin this wise:\r\n\r\n“We, Benedict of Montferrand, Bishop of Lausanne, etc., having heard the\r\nentreaty of the high and mighty lords of Berne against the inger and the\r\nineffectual and rejectable answer of the latter, and having thereupon\r\nfortified ourselves with the Holy Cross, and having before our eyes the\r\nfear of God, from whom alone all just judgments proceed, and being advised\r\nin this cause by a council of men learned in the law, do therefore\r\nacknowledge and avow in this our writing that the appeal against the\r\ndetestable vermin and inger, which are harmful to herbs, vines, meadows,\r\ngrain and other fruits, is valid, and that they be exorcised in the person\r\nof Jean Perrodet, their defender. In conformity therewith we charge and\r\nburden them with our curse, and command them to be obedient and\r\nanathematize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost,\r\nthat they turn away from all fields, grounds, enclosures, seeds, fruits\r\nand produce, and depart. By virtue of the same sentence I declare and\r\naffirm that you are banned and exorcised, and through the power of\r\nAlmighty God shall be called accursed and shall daily decrease\r\nwhithersoever you may go, to the end that of you nothing shall remain save\r\nfor the use and profit of man. _Adiungendo aliquid in devotionem populi._”\r\nThe phrase _das si beswärt werden in die person Johannis Perrodeti irs\r\nbeschirmers_ does not imply that the vermin or the devils, of which they\r\nwere supposed to be incarnations, were to be conjured into him, but refer\r\nto him merely as their proctor and legal representative. The results of\r\nthe prosecution, which had been awaited with intense and anxious interest\r\nby the people, were received with great joy, and the Bernese government\r\nordered a full report of the proceedings to be made. The ecclesiastical\r\nanathema, however, proved to be _brutum fulmen_; nothing more came of it,\r\nsays Schilling, “owing to our sins.” Another chronicler adds that God\r\npermitted the inger to remain as a plague and a punishment until the\r\npeople repented of their wickedness and gave evidence of their love and\r\ngratitude to Him, namely, by giving to the Church tithes of what the\r\ninsects had not destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss priest in his malediction declares that the inger were not in\r\nNoah’s ark and even denies that they are animals properly speaking,\r\nstigmatizing them as living corruption, products of spontaneous generation\r\nperhaps, or more probably creations of the devil. This position was\r\nassumed in order to escape the gross impropriety and glaring incongruity\r\nof having the Church of God curse the creatures which God had made and\r\npronounced very good, and afterwards took pains to preserve from\r\ndestruction by the deluge. This difficulty, always a serious one, was, as\r\nwe have seen, one of the chief points urged by the counsel for the defence\r\nin favour of his clients.\r\n\r\nMalleolus gives the following formula for banning serpents and expelling\r\nthem from human habitations, inculcating incidentally the iniquity of\r\nperjury and judicial injustice: “By virtue of this ban and conjuration I\r\ncommand you to depart from this house and cause it to be as hateful and\r\nintolerable to you, as the man, who knowingly bears false witness or\r\npronounces an unjust sentence, is to God.” Sometimes the exorcism was in\r\nthe form of a prayer, as, for example, in that used for the purgation and\r\ndisinfection of springs and water-courses: “O Lord Jesus, thou who didst\r\nbless the river Jordan and wast baptized in it and hast purified and\r\ncleansed it to the end that it might be a healing element for the\r\nredemption from sin, bless, sanctify and purify this water, so that there\r\nmay be left in it nothing noxious, nothing pestiferous or contagious,\r\nnothing pernicious, but that everything in it may be pure and immaculate,\r\nin order that we may use whatever is created in it for our welfare and to\r\nthy glory, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.”\r\n\r\nIn a Latin protocol of legal proceedings in Crollolanza’s _Storia del\r\nContado di Chiavenna_ it is recorded that on June 26, 1659, Capt. J. B.\r\nPestalozzi came, in behalf of the communes of Chiavenna, Mese, Gordona,\r\nPrada and Samolico, before the commissioner Hartmann Planta and brought\r\ncomplaint against certain caterpillars on account of the devastations\r\ncommitted by them, demanding that these hurtful creatures should be\r\nsummoned by the proper sheriff to appear in court on June 28 at a\r\nspecified hour in order to have a curator and defender appointed, who\r\nshould answer for them to the plaintiffs. A second document, dated June\r\n28, 1659, and signed by the notary Battista Visconti, certifies that the\r\nsaid summons had been duly issued and five copies of the same been posted\r\neach on a tree in the five forests in the territory of the aforesaid five\r\ncommunes. A third document of the same date required the advocate of the\r\naccused, Cesare de Peverello, to appear before the court on the following\r\nTuesday, July 1, in behalf of his recusant clients, who were charged with\r\ntrespassing upon the fields, gardens and orchards and doing great damage\r\ntherein, instead of remaining in their habitat, the forest. The\r\nprosecutors required that they should seek their food in wild and wooded\r\nplaces and cease from ravaging cultivated grounds. A fourth document\r\ncontains an account of the trial; the pleadings of the respective parties,\r\nso far as they are preserved, do not differ essentially from those already\r\nquoted. In the fifth and final document the court recognizes the right of\r\nthe caterpillars to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, provided\r\nthe exercise of this right “does not destroy or impair the happiness of\r\nman, to whom all lower animals are subject.” Accordingly a definite place\r\nof abode is to be assigned to them and various places are proposed. The\r\nprotocol is incomplete, so that we are left in ignorance of the ultimate\r\ndecision. The whole is written in execrable Latin quite worthy of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMore than half-a-century later the Franciscan friars of the cloister of\r\nSt. Anthony in the province of Piedade no Maranhão, Brazil, were greatly\r\nannoyed by termites, which devoured their food, destroyed their furniture,\r\nand even threatened to undermine the walls of the monastery. Application\r\nwas made to the bishop for an act of interdiction and excommunication, and\r\nthe accused were summoned to appear before an ecclesiastical tribunal to\r\ngive account of their conduct. The lawyer appointed to defend them urged\r\nthe usual plea about their being God’s creatures and therefore entitled to\r\nsustenance, and made a good point in the form of an _argumentum ad\r\nmonachum_ by praising the industry of his clients, the white ants, and\r\ndeclaring them to be in this respect far superior to their prosecutors,\r\nthe Gray Friars. He also maintained that the termites were not guilty of\r\ncriminal aggression, but were justified in appropriating the fruits of the\r\nfields by the right derived from priority of possession, inasmuch as they\r\nhad occupied the land long before the monks came and encroached upon their\r\ndomain. The trial lasted for some time and called forth remarkable\r\ndisplays of legal learning and forensic eloquence, with numerous citations\r\nof sacred and profane authorities on both sides, and ended in a\r\ncompromise, by the terms of which the plaintiffs were obliged to provide a\r\nsuitable reservation for the defendants, who were commanded to go thither\r\nand to remain henceforth within the prescribed limits. In the chronicles\r\nof the cloister it is recorded, under date of Jan. 1713, that no sooner\r\nwas the order of the prelatic judge promulgated by being read officially\r\nbefore the hills of the termites than they all came out and marched in\r\ncolumns to the place assigned. The monkish annalist regards this prompt\r\nobedience as conclusive proof that the Almighty endorsed the decision of\r\nthe court. [Cited by Emile Angel on the authority of Manoel Bernardes’\r\n_Nova Floresta, ou Sylva de varios apophthegmas e ditos sentencios\r\nespirituaes e moraes_, etc. Vol. V., Lisboá, 1747.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the sixteenth century the inhabitants of several\r\nvillages in Aargau were greatly annoyed by swarms of gadflies and\r\npetitioned the Bishop of Constance for relief. In the episcopal rescript,\r\nwritten and signed by the vidame Georg Winterstetter, the people are\r\nenjoined to abstain from dancing on Sundays and feast days, from all forms\r\nof libidinousness, gambling with cards or dice and other frivolities.\r\nThese injunctions are followed by prayer and the usual formulas of\r\nconjuration and exorcism. The original document was written in Latin and\r\npreserved in the archives of Baden in Switzerland, but is now lost. In\r\n1566 the Landamman of Unterwalden, Johannes Wirz, took a German\r\ntranslation of it home with him to be used in case of need against the\r\n“vergifteten Würmer,” and deposited it in the archives of Obwalden, where\r\nit still remains. It was published in 1898 by Dr. Merz.\r\n\r\nIn Protestant communities, the priest as exorcist has been superseded, to\r\na considerable extent, by the professional conjurer, who in some portions\r\nof Europe is still employed to save crops from devouring insects and\r\nsimilar plagues. A curious instance of this kind is recorded in Görres’\r\n_Historisch-Politische Blätter_ for 1845 (Heft VII. p. 516). A Protestant\r\ngentleman in Westphalia, whose garden was devastated by worms, after\r\nhaving tried divers vermicidal remedies in vain, resolved to have recourse\r\nto a conjurer. The wizard came and walked about among the vegetables,\r\ntouching them with a wand and muttering enchantments. Some workmen, who\r\nwere repairing the roof of a stable near by, made fun of this hocus-pocus\r\nand began to throw bits of lime at the conjurer. He requested them to\r\ndesist, and finally said: “If you don’t leave me in peace, I shall send\r\nall the worms up on the roof.” This threat only excited the hilarity of\r\nthe scoffers, who continued to ridicule and disturb him in his\r\nincantations. Thereupon he went to the nearest hedge, cut a number of\r\ntwigs, each about a finger in length, and placed them against the wall of\r\nthe stable. Soon the vermin began to abandon the plants and, crawling in\r\ncountless numbers over the twigs and up the wall, took complete possession\r\nof the roof. In less than an hour the men were obliged to stop working and\r\nstood in the court below covered with confusion and cabbage-worms.\r\n\r\nThe writer, who relates this strange incident, fully believes that it\r\nactually occurred, and ascribes it to “the force of human faith and the\r\nmagnetic power of a firm will over nature.” This, too, is the theory held\r\nby Paracelsus, who maintained that the effectiveness of a curse lay in the\r\nenergy of the will, by which the wish, so to speak, concretes into a deed,\r\njust as anger directs the arm and actualizes itself in a blow. By “fervent\r\ndesire” merely, without any physical effort or aggressive act, he deemed\r\nit possible to wound a man’s body or to pierce it through as with a sword.\r\nHe also held that brutes are more easily exorcised or accursed than men,\r\n“for the spirit of man resists more than that of the brute.” Similar\r\nnotions were entertained nearly a century later by Jacob Boehme, who\r\ndefines magic as “doing in the spirit of the will,” an idea which finds\r\nmore recent and more scientific expression in Schopenhauer’s doctrine of\r\n“the objectivation of the will.” Indeed, Schopenhauer’s postulate of the\r\nwill as the sole energy and actuality in the universe is only the\r\nphilosophic statement of an assumption, upon which magicians and\r\nmedicine-men, enchanters, exorcists and anathematizers have acted more or\r\nless in all ages. We have a striking illustration of the workings of some\r\nsuch mysterious, quasi-hyperphysical force in hypnotism, the reality of\r\nwhich it is no longer possible to deny, however wonderful and\r\nincomprehensible its manifestations may appear.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that a religion of individual initiative and personal\r\nresponsibility, like Protestantism, should put less confidence in theurgic\r\nmachinery and formularies of ex-cathedral execration than a religion like\r\nCatholicism, in which man’s spiritual concerns are entrusted to a\r\nhierarchical corporation to be managed according to traditional and\r\ninfallible methods. This tendency crops out in a decree published at\r\nDresden, in 1559, by “Augustus Duke and Elector,” wherein he commends the\r\n“Christian zeal of the worthy and pious parson, Daniel Greysser,” for\r\nhaving “put under ban the sparrows, on account of their unceasing and\r\nextremely vexatious chatterings and scandalous unchastity during the\r\nsermon, to the hindrance of God’s word and of Christian devotion.” But the\r\nSaxon parson, unlike the Bishop of Trier, did not expect that his ban\r\nwould cause the offending birds to avoid the church or to fall dead on\r\nentering it. He relied less on the directly coercive or withering action\r\nof the curse than on the human agencies, which he might thereby set at\r\nwork for the accomplishment of his purpose. By his proscription he put the\r\nculprits out of the pale of public sympathy and protection and gave them\r\nover as a prey to the spoiler, who was persuaded that he was doing a pious\r\nwork by exterminating them. It was solemnly enjoined upon the hunter and\r\nthe fowler to lie in wait for the anathematized sparrows with guns and\r\nwith snares (_durch mancherlei visirliche und listige Wege_); and the\r\nElector issued his decree in order to enforce this duty on all good\r\nChristians. (See Appendix E.)\r\n\r\nA faded and somewhat droll survival of ecclesiastical excommunication and\r\nexorcism is the custom, still prevailing in European countries and some\r\nportions of the United States, of serving a writ of ejectment on rats or\r\nsimply sending them a friendly letter of advice in order to induce them to\r\nquit any house, in which their presence is deemed undesirable. Lest the\r\nrats should overlook and thus fail to read the epistle, it is rubbed with\r\ngrease, so as to attract their attention, rolled up and thrust into their\r\nholes. Mr. William Wells Newell, in a paper on “Conjuring Rats,” printed\r\nin _The Journal of American Folk-Lore_ (Jan.-March, 1892), gives a\r\nspecimen of such a letter, dated, “Maine, Oct. 31, 1888,” and addressed in\r\nbusiness style to “Messrs. Rats and Co.” The writer begins by expressing\r\nhis deep interest in the welfare of said rats as well as his fears lest\r\nthey should find their winter quarters in No. 1, Seaview Street,\r\nuncomfortable and poorly supplied with suitable food, since it is only a\r\nsummer residence and is also about to undergo repairs. He then suggests\r\nthat they migrate to No. 6, Incubator Street, where they “can live snug\r\nand happy” in a splendid cellar well stored with vegetables of all kinds\r\nand can pass easily through a shed leading to a barn containing much\r\ngrain. He concludes by stating that he will do them no harm if they heed\r\nhis advice, otherwise he shall be forced to use “Rough on Rats.” This\r\nthreat of resorting to rat poison in case of the refusal to accept his\r\nkind counsel is all that remains of the once formidable anathema of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, when these domestic rodents became too troublesome, people of\r\nthe lower classes are wont to post the following notice on the walls of\r\ntheir houses:\r\n\r\n            “Ratton and mouse,\r\n  Lea’ the puir woman’s house,\r\n  Gang awa’ owre by to ’e mill,\r\n  And there ane and a’ ye’ll get your fill.”\r\n\r\nIn order to make the conjuration effective some particular abode must be\r\nassigned to them; it is not sufficient to bid them begone, but they are to\r\nbe told to go to a definite place. The fact that they are usually sent\r\nacross a river or brook may indicate a lingering tradition of their\r\ndemoniacal character, since, according to a widespread popular\r\nsuperstition, a water-course is a barrier to hobgoblins and evil spirits:\r\n\r\n  “A running stream they dare na cross.”\r\n\r\nIn this case the rats, as imps of Satan, having reached their destination,\r\nwould find it impossible to return.\r\n\r\nIt was in Ireland, the native realm of bulls and like incongruities, that\r\nconjuring or “rhyming” rats seems to have been most common, if we may\r\njudge from the manner in which it is alluded to by the Elizabethan poets.\r\nThus in _As you Like It_ Rosalind says in reference to Orlando’s verses:\r\n“I was never so be-rhymed since Pythagoras’ time, that I was an Irish rat,\r\nwhich I can hardly remember.” Randolph declares:\r\n\r\n                                    “My poets\r\n  Shall with a satire, steep’d in gall and vinegar,\r\n  Rhime ’em to death, as they do rats in Ireland.”\r\n\r\nBen Jonson is still more specific:\r\n\r\n  “Rhime ’em to death, as they do Irish rats,\r\n   In drumming tunes.”\r\n\r\nFrom this reference to the mode of conjuring it appears that the repeating\r\nof the rhymes was accompanied with the beating of a drum, as is still the\r\nusage in France. From the very earliest times a peculiar magical potency\r\nhas been ascribed to words woven into rhythmic form. The fascination which\r\nmetrical expression, even as a mere jingle and jargon, still retains for\r\nthe youth of the individual was yet far more strongly felt in the youth of\r\nthe race. The simple song was intoned as a spell and the rude chant\r\nmumbled as a charm.\r\n\r\nIn France the conjuration of field-mice bears a more distinctly religious\r\nstamp. On the first Sunday in Lent, the so-called Feast of the Torches\r\n(_la Fête des Brandons ou des Bures_), the peasants wander in all\r\ndirections through the fields and orchards with lighted torches of twisted\r\nstraw, uttering the following incantation, which not only threatens to\r\nburn the whiskers of obdurate mice, but also hints at the wine-bibbing\r\npropensities of the curate:\r\n\r\n  “Sortez, sortez d’ici, mulots!\r\n   Ou je vais vous bruler les crocs!\r\n   Quittez, quittez ces blés!\r\n   Allez, vous trouverez\r\n   Dans la cave du curé\r\n   Plus à boire qu’à manger.”\r\n\r\nThe form of imprecation varies in different provinces, but usually\r\nincludes some threat of breaking the bones or burning the beards of the\r\nrefractory rodents, in case they refuse to quit the close, as in the\r\nfollowing summons:\r\n\r\n  “Taupes et mulots,\r\n   Sors de mon clos,\r\n   Ou je te casse les os;\r\n   Barbassione! Si tu viens dans non clos,\r\n   Je te brûle la barbe jusqu’aux os.”\r\n\r\nThe utterance of these words is emphasized by loud and discordant noises\r\nof cat-calls, tin horns, and similar instruments of “Callithumpian” music.\r\n\r\nGregory, who was Bishop of Tours in the latter half of the sixth century,\r\nstates in his _History of the Franks_ (VIII. 35) that bronze talismans\r\nrepresenting dormice and serpents were used in Paris to protect the city\r\nagainst the ravages of these creatures; and when the town of Le Mans was\r\nrebuilt after its destruction by fire in 1145, a toad with a gold chain\r\nround its neck, was enclosed in a block of stone as a preservative against\r\nvenomous reptiles. (Le Corvasier: _Hist, des Évêques du Mans_, 1648, p.\r\n441. Cf. Desnoyers: _Recherches_, etc., p. 7.)\r\n\r\nThe use of the above-mentioned means of conjuration is unquestionably of\r\nvery ancient date. Thus in a treatise on agriculture entitled τὰ γεωπονικά\r\nand consisting of twenty books, written in the tenth century by the\r\nBithynian Byzantine, Kassianos Bassos, the following prescription is given\r\nfor getting rid of field-mice:\r\n\r\n“Take a slip of paper and write on it these words: I adjure you, O mice,\r\nwho dwell here not to injure me yourselves nor to permit any other mouse\r\nto do so; and I make over to you this field (describing it). But should I\r\nfind you staying here after having been warned, with the help of the\r\nmother of the gods I will cut you in seven pieces.” The author quotes this\r\nrecipe, in order, as he says, that nothing may remain unrecorded, but\r\nexpressly declares that he has no confidence in its efficiency and advises\r\nthe husbandman to put his trust in good rat-bane. Bassos derived the\r\nmaterials for his popular encyclopædia chiefly from the “Geoponics”\r\ncomposed by Anatolios and Didymos some six centuries earlier, and even\r\nmost of his citations of classical writers are taken from the same\r\nsources. That the above-mentioned exorcism is pagan in its origin is\r\nevident from the invocation of the aid of Cybele for the destruction of\r\ndisobedient vermin. In a Christian conjuration the Mother of God would\r\nhave been substituted for the mother of the gods, whom the Greeks revered\r\nas the personification of all-creating and all-sustaining nature. The\r\nresemblance of this formula, which the Greeks may have borrowed with the\r\nworship of Cybele from the Phrygians, to the Yankee’s letter of advice is\r\npeculiarly interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient conjuration the harmful or undesirable animals were\r\ncommanded to go to a certain locality, set apart for them, and this\r\ninjunction was accompanied with dire threats in case of disobedience; the\r\nmilder epistolary form of the present day is more advisory and persuasive\r\nand offers them inducements to migrate and to take up their abode\r\nelsewhere. Sometimes this kind counsel is given verbally, as, for example,\r\nin Thuringia, where it is customary to get rid of cabbage-worms by going\r\ninto the garden, requesting them to depart, and calling out: “In yonder\r\nvillage is church-ale (_Kirmes_)”; thus implying that they will find\r\nbetter entertainment at this festival. (Witzschel: _Sagen, Sitten und\r\nGebräuche aus Thüringen_. Wien, 1878, p. 217.) The willingness of peasant\r\ncommunities to ward off evil from themselves at the expense of their\r\nneighbours is a survival of the primitive ethics, which recognizes only\r\nthe rights of the family or tribe and treats all aliens as foes. It is the\r\nsame feeling that causes the inhabitants of the Alps to erect so-called\r\nweather-crosses (_Wetterkreuze_) for the purpose of averting\r\nthunder-storms and hailstones from themselves by diverting them into an\r\nadjacent valley. This method of protection is based upon the theory that\r\ntempests, hurricanes, and all violent commotions of nature are the work of\r\ndemons or witches, who avoid the symbol of Christ’s death and the world’s\r\nredemption and direct their fury elsewhere. A like egotism is expressed in\r\nthe inscription on many houses of peasants entreating St. Florian to\r\npreserve their habitation from flames and to set fire to others, as though\r\nthe holy man must indulge his incendiary passion by pouring out upon some\r\nhuman abode the blazing vessel, which he is represented as bearing in his\r\nhand. The inscription is the same as that with which Reynard the Fox\r\nadorned his castle Malepartus, and which might be translated:\r\n\r\n  “Saint Florian, thou martyr blessed,\r\n   Protect this house and burn the rest.”\r\n\r\nNot only were insects, reptiles and small mammals, such as rats and mice,\r\nlegally prosecuted and formally excommunicated, but judicial penalties,\r\nincluding capital punishment, were also inflicted upon larger quadrupeds.\r\nIn the Report and Researches on this subject, published by\r\nBerriat-Saint-Prix in the _Memoirs of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of\r\nFrance_ (Paris, 1829, Tome VIII. pp. 403-50), numerous extracts from the\r\noriginal records of such proceedings are given, and also a list of the\r\nkinds of animals thus tried and condemned, extending from the beginning of\r\nthe twelfth to the middle of the eighteenth century, and comprising in all\r\nninety-three cases. This list has been enlarged by D’Addosio so as to\r\ncover the period from 824 to 1845, and to include one hundred and\r\nforty-four prosecutions resulting in the execution or excommunication of\r\nthe accused, but even this record is by no means complete. (_Vide_\r\nAppendix F for a still fuller list.)\r\n\r\nThe culprits are a miscellaneous crew, consisting chiefly of caterpillars,\r\nflies, locusts, leeches, snails, slugs, worms, weevils, rats, mice,\r\nmoles, turtle-doves, pigs, bulls, cows, cocks, dogs, asses, mules, mares\r\nand goats. Only those cases are reported in which the accused were found\r\nguilty; of these prosecutions, according to the above-mentioned registers,\r\ntwo belong to the ninth century, one to the eleventh, three to the\r\ntwelfth, two to the thirteenth, six to the fourteenth, thirty-four to the\r\nfifteenth, forty-five to the sixteenth, forty-three to the seventeenth,\r\nseven to the eighteenth and one to the nineteenth century. To this list\r\nmight be added other cases, such as the prosecution and malediction of\r\nnoxious insects at Glurns in the Tyrol in 1519, at Als in Jutland in 1711,\r\nat Bouranton in 1733, at Lyö in Denmark in 1805-6, and at Pozega in\r\nSlavonia in 1866. In the latter case one of the largest of the locusts was\r\nseized and tried and then put to death by being thrown into the water with\r\nanathemas on the whole species. A few years ago swarms of locusts\r\ndevastated the region near Kallipolis in Turkey, and a petition was sent\r\nby the Christian population to the monks of Mount Athos begging them to\r\nbear in solemn procession through the fields the girdle of St. Basilius,\r\nin order to expel the insects. This request was granted, and as the\r\nlocusts gradually disappeared, because there was little or nothing left\r\nfor them to eat, the orthodox of the Greek Church from the bishop to the\r\nhumblest laymen firmly believed or at least maintained that a miracle had\r\nbeen wrought. Pious Mohammedans exorcise and ostracize locusts and other\r\nharmful insects by reading the Koran aloud in the ravaged fields, as was\r\nrecently done at Denislue in Asia Minor with satisfactory results. Also as\r\nlate as 1864 at Pleternica in Slavonia, a pig was tried and executed for\r\nhaving maliciously bitten off the ears of a female infant aged one year.\r\nThe flesh of the condemned animal was cut in pieces and thrown to the\r\ndogs, and the head of the family, in which the pig lived, as is the custom\r\nof pigs among the peasants of that country, was put under bonds to provide\r\na dowry for the mutilated child, so that the loss of her ears might not\r\nprove to be an insuperable obstacle to her marriage. (_Amira_, p. 578.) It\r\nwould be incorrect to infer from the tables just referred to that no\r\njudicial punishment of animals occurred in the tenth century or that the\r\nfifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries were peculiarly addicted\r\nto such practices. It is well known that during some of the darkest\r\nperiods of the Middle Ages and even in later times the registers of the\r\ncourts were very imperfectly kept, and in many instances the archives have\r\nbeen entirely destroyed. It is highly probable, therefore, that the cases\r\nof capital prosecution and conviction of animals, which have been\r\ncollected and printed by Berriat-Saint-Prix and others, however thorough\r\ntheir investigations may have been, constitute only a very small\r\npercentage of those which actually took place.\r\n\r\nBeasts were often condemned to be burned alive; and strangely enough, it\r\nwas in the latter half of the seventeenth century, an age of comparative\r\nenlightenment, that this cruel penalty seems to have been most frequently\r\ninflicted. Occasionally a merciful judge adhered to the letter of the law\r\nand curbed its barbarous spirit by sentencing the culprit to be slightly\r\nsinged and then to be strangled before being committed to the flames.\r\nSometimes brutes were doomed to be buried alive. Thus we have the receipt\r\nof “Phélippart, sergeant of high justice of the city of Amiens,” for the\r\nsum of sixteen soldi, in payment for services rendered in March 1463, in\r\n“having buried in the earth two pigs, which had torn and eaten with their\r\nteeth a little child in the faubourg of Amiens, who for this cause passed\r\nfrom life to death (_étoit allé de vie a trépas_).” In 1557, on the 6th of\r\nDecember, a pig in the Commune of Saint-Quentin was condemned to be\r\n“buried all alive” (_enfoui tout vif_), “for having devoured a little\r\nchild in l’hostel de la Couronne.” Again, a century earlier, in 1456, two\r\npigs were subjected to this punishment, “on the vigil of the Holy Virgin,”\r\nat Oppenheim on the Rhine, for having killed a child. More than three\r\ncenturies later the same means were employed for curing murrain, which in\r\nthe summer of 1796 had broken out at Beutelsbach in Würtemberg and carried\r\noff many head of cattle. By the advice of a French veterinary doctor, who\r\nwas quartered there with the army of General Moreau, the town bull was\r\nburied alive at the crossroads in the presence of several hundred persons.\r\nWe are not informed whether this sacrifice proved to be a sufficiently\r\n“powerful medicine” to stay the epizoötic plague; the noteworthy fact is\r\nthat the superstitious rite was prescribed and performed, not by an Indian\r\nmagician or an African sorcerer, but by an official of the French\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nAnimals are said to have been even put to the rack in order to extort\r\nconfession. It is not to be supposed that, in such cases, the judge had\r\nthe slightest expectation that any confession would be made; he wished\r\nmerely to observe all forms prescribed by the law, and to set in motion\r\nthe whole machinery of justice before pronouncing judgment. The statement\r\nof a French writer, Arthur Mangin (_L’Homme et la Bête._ Paris, 1872, p.\r\n344), that “the cries which they uttered under torture were received as\r\nconfessions of guilt,” is absurd. No such notion was ever entertained by\r\ntheir tormentor. “The question,” which under the circumstances would seem\r\nto be only a wanton and superfluous act of cruelty, was nevertheless an\r\nimportant element in determining the final decision, since the sentence of\r\ndeath could be commuted into banishment, whipping, incarceration or some\r\nmilder form of punishment, provided the criminal had not confessed his\r\nguilt under torture. The use of the rack might be, therefore, a merciful\r\nmeans of escaping the gallows. Appeals were sometimes made to higher\r\ntribunals and the judgments of the lower courts annulled or modified. In\r\none instance a sow and a she-ass were condemned to be hanged; on appeal,\r\nand after a new trial, they were sentenced to be simply knocked on the\r\nhead. Occasionally an appeal led to the acquittal of the accused.\r\n\r\nIn 1266, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, near Paris, a pig convicted of having\r\neaten a child was publicly burned by order of the monks of Sainte\r\nGeneviève. In 1386, the tribunal of Falaise sentenced a sow to be mangled\r\nand maimed in the head and forelegs, and then to be hanged, for having\r\ntorn the face and arms of a child and thus caused its death. Here we have\r\na strict application of the _lex talionis_, the primitive retributive\r\nprinciple of taking an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. As if to\r\nmake the travesty of justice complete, the sow was dressed in man’s\r\nclothes and executed on the public square near the city-hall at an expense\r\nto the state of ten sous and ten deniers, besides a pair of gloves to the\r\nhangman. The executioner was provided with new gloves in order that he\r\nmight come from the discharge of his duty, metaphorically at least, with\r\nclean hands, thus indicating that, as a minister of justice, he incurred\r\nno guilt in shedding blood. He was no common pig-killer, but a public\r\nfunctionary, a “master of high works” (_maître des hautes œuvres_), as he\r\nwas officially styled. (_Vide_ Appendix G.)\r\n\r\nWe may add that the west wall of the south branch of the transept in the\r\nChurch of the Holy Trinity (_Sainte-Trinité_) at Falaise in Normandy was\r\nformerly adorned with a fresco-painting of this execution, which is\r\nmentioned in _Statistique de Falaise_ (1827, t. I. 83), and more fully\r\ndescribed by l’Abbé Pierre-Gilles Langevin, in his _Recherches Historiques\r\nsur Falaise_ (1814, p. 146). In a Supplement (p. 12) to this work,\r\npublished several years later, the Abbé states that, about the year 1820,\r\nthe entire church, including the fresco, was whitewashed, so that the\r\npicture has since then been invisible, and, so far as can be ascertained,\r\nno engraving or other copy of it has ever been made. Unfortunately, too,\r\nas the same writer informs us, _la châsse de la bannière_ (banner-holder)\r\nwas fastened to the wall of the church on this very spot, thus covering\r\nand permanently destroying at least a portion of the painting.\r\n\r\nIn 1394, a pig was found guilty of “having killed and murdered a child in\r\nthe parish of Roumaygne, in the county of Mortaing, for which deed the\r\nsaid pig was condemned to be haled and hanged by Jehan Petit, lieutenant\r\nof the bailiff.” The work was really done by the hangman (_pendart_),\r\nJehan Micton, who received for his services the sum of “fifty souls\r\ntournois.” (_Vide_ Appendix H.) In another case the deputy bailiff of\r\nMantes and Meullant presented a bill, dated March 15, 1403, which\r\ncontained the following items of expense incurred for the incarceration\r\nand execution of an infanticide sow:\r\n\r\n    “Cost of keeping her in jail, six sols parisis.\r\n\r\n    “Item, to the master of high works, who came from Paris to Meullant to\r\n    perform the said execution by comand and authority of the said\r\n    bailiff, our master, and of the procurator of the king, fifty-four\r\n    sols parisis.\r\n\r\n    “Item, for a carriage to take her to justice, six sols parisis.\r\n\r\n    “Item, for cords to bind and hale her, two sols eight deniers parisis.\r\n\r\n    “Item, for gloves, two deniers parisis.”\r\n\r\nThis account, which amounted in all to sixty-nine sols eight deniers\r\nparisis, was examined and approved by the auditor of the court, De\r\nBaudemont, who affixed to it his own seal with signature and paraph and\r\n“in further confirmation and approbation thereof caused it to be sealed\r\nwith the seal of the Chatellany of Meullant, on the 15th day of March in\r\nthe year 1403.” (See Appendix I.) In the following year a pig was executed\r\nat Rouvres for the same offence.\r\n\r\nBrutes and human criminals were confined in the same prison and subjected\r\nto the same treatment. Thus “Toustain Pincheon, keeper of the prisons of\r\nour lord the king in the town of Pont de Larche,” acknowledges the\r\nreceipt, “through the hand of the honourable and wise man, Jehan Monnet,\r\nsheriff (_vicomte_) of the said town, of nineteen sous six deniers\r\ntournois for having found the king’s bread for the prisoners detained, by\r\nreason of crime, in the said prison.” The jailer gives the names of the\r\npersons in custody, and concludes the list with “Item, one pig, conducted\r\ninto the said prison and kept there from the 24th of June, 1408,\r\ninclusive, till the 17th of the following July,” when it was hanged “for\r\nthe crime of having murdered and killed a little child” (_pource que\r\nicellui porc avoit muldry et tue ung pettit enfant_). For the pig’s board\r\nthe jailer charged two deniers tournois a day, the same as for boarding a\r\nman, thus placing the porker, even in respect to its maintenance, on a\r\nfooting of perfect equality with the human prisoners. He also puts into\r\nthe account “ten deniers tournois for a rope, found and furnished for the\r\npurpose of tying the said pig that it might not escape.” The correctness\r\nof the charges is certified to by “Jean Gaulvant, sworn tabellion of our\r\nlord the king in the viscounty of Pont de Larche.” (_Vide_ Appendix J.)\r\nAgain in 1474, the official of the Bishop of Lausanne sentenced a pig to\r\nbe hanged “until death ensueth,” for having devoured an infant in its\r\ncradle in the vicinity of Oron, and to remain suspended from the gallows\r\nfor a certain length of time as a warning to wrong-doers. It is also\r\nexpressly stated that, in 1585, the body of a pig, which had been executed\r\nfor the murder of a child at Saint-Omer, at the hostelry of Mortier d’Or,\r\nwas left hanging “for a long space” on a gibbet in a field near the\r\nhighway. (Derheims: _Histoire de Saint-Omer_, p. 327.) A little later a\r\nsimilar spectacle met the eyes of Guy Pape, as he was going to\r\nChâlons-sur-Marne in Champagne, to pay homage to King Henry IV. In his own\r\nwords: _dum ibam ad civitatem Cathalani in Campania ad Regem tunc ibi\r\nexistentem, vidi quemdam porcum, in furcis suspensum, qui dicebatur\r\noccidisse quemdam puerum_. (Quaestio CCXXXVIII: _De poena bruti\r\ndelinquentis_. Lugduni, MDCX.)\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September, 1379, as two herds of swine, one belonging to the\r\ncommune and the other to the priory of Saint-Marcel-le-Jeussey, were\r\nfeeding together near that town, three sows of the communal herd, excited\r\nand enraged by the squealing of one of the porklings, rushed upon Perrinot\r\nMuet, the son of the swinekeeper, and before his father could come to his\r\nrescue, threw him to the ground and so severely injured him that he died\r\nsoon afterwards. The three sows, after due process of law, were condemned\r\nto death; and as both the herds had hastened to the scene of the murder\r\nand by their cries and aggressive actions showed that they approved of the\r\nassault, and were ready and even eager to become _participes criminis_,\r\nthey were arrested as accomplices and sentenced by the court to suffer the\r\nsame penalty. But the prior, Friar Humbert de Poutiers, not willing to\r\nendure the loss of his swine, sent an humble petition to Philip the Bold,\r\nthen Duke of Burgundy, praying that both the herds, with the exception of\r\nthe three sows actually guilty of the murder, might receive a full and\r\nfree pardon. The duke lent a gracious ear to this supplication and ordered\r\nthat the punishment should be remitted and the swine released. (_Vide_\r\nAppendix K.)\r\n\r\nA peculiar custom is referred to in the _procès verbal_ of the prosecution\r\nof a porker for infanticide, dated May 20, 1572. The murder was committed\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the monastery of Moyen-Montier, where the case\r\nwas tried and the accused sentenced to be “hanged and strangled on a\r\ngibbet.” The prisoner was then bound with a cord and conducted to a cross\r\nnear the cemetery, where it was formally given over to an executioner from\r\nNancy. “From time immemorial,” we are told, “the justiciary of the Lord\r\nAbbot of Moyen-Montier has been accustomed to consign to the provost of\r\nSaint-Diez, near this cross, condemned criminals, wholly naked, that they\r\nmay be executed; but inasmuch as this pig is a brute beast, he has\r\ndelivered the same bound with a cord, without prejudicing or in any wise\r\nimpairing the right of the Lord Abbot to deliver condemned criminals\r\nwholly naked.” The pig must not wear a rope unless the right to do without\r\nit be expressly reserved, lest some human culprit, under similar\r\ncircumstances, should claim to be entitled to raiment.\r\n\r\n  “’Twill be recorded for a precedent;\r\n   And many an error, by the same example\r\n   Will rush into the state: it cannot be.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of a mule condemned to be burned alive together with a man\r\nguilty of buggery, at Montpellier, in 1565, as the quadruped was vicious\r\nand inclined to kick (_vitiosus et calcitrosus_), the executioner cut off\r\nits feet before consigning it to the flames. This mutilation was an\r\narbitrary and extra-judicial act, dictated solely by considerations of\r\npersonal convenience. Hangmen often indulged in capricious and\r\nsupererogatory cruelty in the exercise of their patibulary functions, and\r\nmediæval as well as later writers on criminal jurisprudence repeatedly\r\ncomplain of this evil and call for reform. Thus Damhouder, in his _Rerum\r\nCriminalium Praxis_ (_cap. de carnifice_, p. 234), urges magistrates to be\r\nmore careful in selecting persons for this important office, and not to\r\nchoose evil-doers, “assiduous gamblers, public whoremongers, malicious\r\nback-biters, impious blasphemers, assassins, thieves, murderers, robbers,\r\nand other violators of the law as vindicators of justice.” Indeed, these\r\nhardened wretches sometimes took the law into their own hands. For\r\nexample, on the 9th of June, 1576, at Schweinfurt in Franconia, a sow,\r\nwhich had bitten off the ear and torn the hand of a carpenter’s child,\r\nwas given into custody, whereupon the hangman, without legal authority,\r\ntook it to the gallows-green (Schindrasen) and there “hanged it publicly\r\nto the disgrace and detriment of the city.” For this impudent usurpation\r\nof judiciary powers Jack Ketch was forced to flee and never dared return.\r\nHence arose the proverbial phrase Schweinfurter Sauhenker (Schweinfurt\r\nsow-hangman), used to characterize a low and lawless ruffian and vile\r\nfellow of the baser sort. It was not the mere killing of the sow, but the\r\nexecution without a judicial decision, the insult and contempt of the\r\nmagistracy and the judicatory by arrogating their functions, that excited\r\nthe public wrath and official indignation.\r\n\r\nBuggery (_offensa cujus nominatio crimen est_, as it is euphemistically\r\ndesignated in legal documents) was uniformly punished by putting to death\r\nboth parties implicated, and usually by burning them alive. The beast,\r\ntoo, is punished and both are burned (_punitur etiam pecus et ambo\r\ncomburuntur_), says Guillielmus Benedictinus, a writer on law, who lived\r\nabout the end of the fourteenth century. Thus, in 1546, a man and a cow\r\nwere hanged and then burned by order of the parliament of Paris, the\r\nsupreme court of France. In 1466, the same tribunal condemned a man and a\r\nsow to be burned at Corbeil. Occasionally interment was substituted for\r\nincremation. Thus in 1609, at Niederrad, a man and a mare were executed\r\nand their bodies buried in the same carrion-pit. On the 12th of September,\r\n1606, the mayor of Loens de Chartres, on complaint of the dean, canons,\r\nand chapter of the cathedral of Chartres, condemned a man named Guillaume\r\nGuyart to be “hanged and strangled on a gibbet in reparation and\r\npunishment of sodomy, whereof the said Guyart is declared accused,\r\nattainted and convicted.” A bitch, his accomplice, was sentenced to be\r\nknocked on the head (_assommée_) by the executioner of high justice and\r\n“the dead bodies of both to be burned and reduced to ashes.” It is\r\nfurthermore added that if the said Guyart, who seems to have\r\ncontumaciously given leg-bail, cannot be seized and apprehended in person,\r\nthe sentence shall, in his case, be executed in effigy by attaching his\r\nlikeness in painting to the gibbet. It was also decreed that all the\r\nproperty of the absconder should be confiscated and the sum of one hundred\r\nand fifty livres be adjudged to the plaintiffs, out of which the costs of\r\nthe trial were to be defrayed. (_Vide_ Appendix L.) This disgusting crime\r\nappears to have been very common; at least Ayrault in his _Ordre\r\nJudiciaire_, published in 1606, states that he has many times\r\n(_multoties_) seen brute beasts put to death for this cause. In his\r\n_Magnalia Christi Americana_ (Book VI, (III), London, 1702) Cotton Mather\r\nrecords that “on June 6, 1662, at New Haven, there was a most\r\nunparalleled wretch, one Potter by name, about sixty years of age,\r\nexecuted for damnable Bestialities.” He had been a member of the Church\r\nfor twenty years and was noted for his piety, “devout in worship, gifted\r\nin prayer, forward in edifying discourse among the religious, and zealous\r\nin reforming the sins of other people.” Yet this monster, who is described\r\nas possessed by an unclean devil, “lived in most infandous Buggeries for\r\nno less than fifty years together, and now at the gallows there were\r\nkilled before his eyes a cow, two heifers, three sheep and two sows, with\r\nall of which he had committed his brutalities. His wife had seen him\r\nconfounding himself with a bitch ten years before; and he then excused\r\nhimself as well as he could, but conjured her to keep it secret.” He\r\nafterwards hanged the bitch, probably as a sort of vicarious atonement.\r\nAccording to this account he must have begun to practice sodomy when he\r\nwas ten years of age, a vicious precocity which the author would doubtless\r\nexplain on the theory of diabolical possession. In 1681, a habitual\r\nsodomite, who had been wont to defile himself with greyhounds, cows,\r\nswine, sheep and all manner of beasts, was brought to trial together with\r\na mare, at Wünschelburg in Silesia, where both were burned alive. In 1684,\r\non the 3rd of May, a bugger was beheaded at Ottendorf, and the mare, his\r\npartner in crime, knocked on the head; it was expressly enjoined that in\r\nburning the bodies the man’s should lie underneath that of the beast. In\r\nthe following year, fourteen days before Christmas, a journeyman tailor,\r\n“who had committed the unnatural deed of carnal lewdness with a mare,” was\r\nburned at Striga together with the mare.\r\n\r\nFor the same offence Benjamin Deschauffour was condemned, May 25, 1726, to\r\nbe tied to a stake and there burned alive “together with the minutes of\r\nthe trial;” his ashes were strewed to the wind and his estates seized and,\r\nafter the deduction of a fine of three thousand livres, confiscated to the\r\nbenefit of his Majesty. In the case of Jacques Ferron, who was taken in\r\nthe act of coition with a she-ass at Vanvres in 1750, and after due\r\nprocess of law, sentenced to death, the animal was acquitted on the ground\r\nthat she was the victim of violence and had not participated in her\r\nmaster’s crime of her own free-will. The prior of the convent, who also\r\nperformed the duties of parish priest, and the principal inhabitants of\r\nthe commune of Vanvres signed a certificate stating that they had known\r\nthe said she-ass for four years, and that she had always shown herself to\r\nbe virtuous and well-behaved both at home and abroad and had never given\r\noccasion of scandal to any one, and that therefore “they were willing to\r\nbear witness that she is in word and deed and in all her habits of life a\r\nmost honest creature.” This document, given at Vanvres on Sept. 19, 1750,\r\nand signed by “Pintuel Prieur Curé” and the other attestors, was produced\r\nduring the trial and exerted a decisive influence upon the judgment of the\r\ncourt. As a piece of exculpatory evidence it may be regarded as unique in\r\nthe annals of criminal prosecutions.\r\n\r\nThe Carolina or criminal code of the emperor Charles V., promulgated at\r\nthe diet of Ratisbon in 1532, ordained that sodomy in all its forms and\r\ndegrees should be punished with death by fire “according to common custom”\r\n(“_so ein_ Mensch mit einem Viehe, Mann mit Mann, Weib mit Weib,\r\nUnkeuschheit treibet, die haben auch das Leben verwircket, und man soll\r\nsie der gemeinen Gewohnheit nach mit dem Feuer vom Leben zum Tode\r\nrichten.” Art. 116.), but stipulated that, if for any reason the\r\npunishment of the sodomite should be mitigated, the same measure of mercy\r\nshould be shown to the beast. This principle is reaffirmed by Benedict\r\nCarpzov in his _Pratica Nova Rerum Criminalium_ (Wittenberg, 1635), in\r\nwhich he states that “if for any cause the sodomite shall be punished only\r\nwith the sword, then the beast participant of his crime shall not be\r\nburned, but shall be struck dead and buried by the knacker or field-master\r\n(_Caviller oder Feldmeister_).” The bugger was also bound to compensate\r\nthe owner for the loss of the animal, or, if he left no property, the\r\nvalue must be paid out of the public treasury. “If the criminal act was\r\nnot fully consummated, then the human offender was publicly scourged and\r\nbanished, and the animal, instead of being killed, was put away out of\r\nsight in order that no one might be scandalized thereby” [Jacobi Döpleri,\r\n_Theatrum Poenarum Suppliciorum et Executionum Criminalium, oder\r\nSchau-Platz derer Leibes- und Lebens-Straffen_, etc. Sondershausen, 1693,\r\nII. p. 151.]\r\n\r\nAll Christian legislation on this subject is simply an application and\r\namplification of the Mosaic law as recorded in Exodus xxii. 19 and\r\nLeviticus xx. 13-16, just as the cruel persecutions and prosecutions for\r\nwitchcraft in mediæval and modern times derive their authority and\r\njustification from the succinct and peremptory command: “Thou shalt not\r\nsuffer a witch to live.” In the older criminal codes two kinds or degrees\r\nof sodomy are mentioned, _gravius_ and _gravissimum_; the former being\r\ncondemned in the thirteenth verse and the latter in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth verses of Leviticus. Döpler tells some strange stories of the\r\nresults of the _peccatum gravissimum_; and the fact that a sober writer on\r\njurisprudence could believe and seriously narrate such absurdities,\r\nfurnishes a curious contribution to the history of human credulity.\r\n\r\nIt is rather odd that Christian law-givers should have adopted a Jewish\r\ncode against sexual intercourse with beasts and then enlarged it so as to\r\ninclude the Jews themselves. The question was gravely discussed by\r\njurists, whether cohabitation of a Christian with a Jewess or _vice versa_\r\nconstitutes sodomy. Damhouder (_Prax. Rer. Crim._ c., 96, n. 48) is of the\r\nopinion that it does, and Nicolaus Boër (Decis., 136, n. 5) cites the case\r\nof a certain Johannes Alardus or Jean Alard, who kept a Jewess in his\r\nhouse in Paris and had several children by her; he was convicted of sodomy\r\non account of this relation and burned, together with his paramour, “since\r\ncoition with a Jewess is precisely the same as if a man should copulate\r\nwith a dog” (Döpl., _Theat._, II. p. 157). Damhouder, in the work just\r\ncited, includes Turks and Saracens in the same category, “inasmuch as such\r\npersons in the eye of the law and our holy faith differ in no wise from\r\nbeasts.”\r\n\r\nBut to resume the subject of the perpetration of felonious homicide by\r\nanimals, on the 10th of January, 1457, a sow was convicted of “murder\r\nflagrantly committed on the person of Jehan Martin, aged five years, the\r\nson of Jehan Martin of Savigny,” and sentenced to be “hanged by the hind\r\nfeet to a gallows-tree (_a ung arbre esproné_).” Her six sucklings, being\r\nfound stained with blood, were included in the indictment as accomplices;\r\nbut “in lack of any positive proof that they had assisted in mangling the\r\ndeceased, they were restored to their owner, on condition that he should\r\ngive bail for their appearance, should further evidence be forthcoming to\r\nprove their complicity in their mother’s crime.” Above three weeks later,\r\non the 2nd of February, to wit “on the Friday after the feast of Our Lady\r\nthe Virgin,” the sucklings were again brought before the court; and, as\r\ntheir owner, Jehan Bailly, openly repudiated them and refused to be\r\nanswerable in any wise for their future good conduct, they were declared,\r\nas vacant property, forfeited to the noble damsel Katherine de Barnault,\r\nLady of Savigny. This case is particularly interesting on account of the\r\ncompleteness with which the _procès verbal_ has been preserved. (See\r\nAppendix M.)\r\n\r\nSometimes a fine was imposed upon the owner of the offending animal, as\r\nwas the case with Jehan Delalande and his wife, who were condemned, on the\r\n18th of April, 1499, by the bailiff of the Abbey of Josaphat near\r\nChartres, to pay a fine of eighteen francs and to be confined in prison\r\nuntil this sum should be paid, “on account of the murder of a child named\r\nGilon, aged five and a half years or thereabouts, perpetrated by a porker,\r\naged three months or thereabouts.” The pig was condemned to be “hanged and\r\nexecuted by justice.” The owners were punished because they were supposed\r\nto have been culpably negligent of the child, who had been confided to\r\ntheir care and keeping, and not because they had, in the eye of the law,\r\nany proprietary responsibility for the infanticidal animal. The mulct\r\nimplied remissness on their part as guardians or foster-parents of the\r\ninfant. In general, as we have seen, the owner of the blood-guilty beast\r\nwas considered wholly blameless and sometimes even remunerated for his\r\nloss. (_Vide_ Appendix N.)\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of the Bogos, a pastoral and nominally Christian\r\ntribe of Northern Abyssinia, a bull, cow or any other animal which kills a\r\nman is put to death; the owner of the homicidal beast is not held in any\r\nwise responsible for its crime, nevertheless he practically incurs a\r\nsomewhat heavy penalty by not receiving any compensation for the loss of\r\nhis property. This exercise of justice is quite common among the tribes of\r\nCentral Africa. In Montenegro, horses, oxen and pigs have been recently\r\ntried for homicide and put to death, unless the owner redeemed them by\r\npaying a ransom.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of June, 1494, a young pig was arrested for having “strangled\r\nand defaced a young child in its cradle, the son of Jehan Lenfant, a\r\ncowherd on the fee-farm of Clermont, and of Gillon his wife,” and\r\nproceeded against “as justice and reason would desire and require.”\r\nSeveral witnesses were examined, who testified “on their oath and\r\nconscience” that “on the morning of Easter Day, as the father was guarding\r\ncattle and his wife Gillon was absent in the village of Dizy, the infant\r\nbeing left alone in its cradle, the said pig entered during the said time\r\nthe said house and disfigured and ate the face and neck of the said\r\nchild, which, in consequence of the bites and defacements inflicted by the\r\nsaid pig, departed this life (_de ce siècle trépassa_).” The sentence\r\npronounced by the judge was as follows, “We, in detestation and horror of\r\nthe said crime, and to the end that an example may be made and justice\r\nmaintained, have said, judged, sentenced, pronounced and appointed, that\r\nthe said porker, now detained as a prisoner and confined in the said\r\nabbey, shall be by the master of high works hanged and strangled on a\r\ngibbet of wood near and adjoinant to the gallows and high place of\r\nexecution belonging to the said monks, being contiguous to their fee-farm\r\nof Avin.” The crime was committed “on the fee-farm of\r\nClermont-lez-Montcornet, appertaining in all matters of high, mean and\r\nbase justice to the monks of the order of Premonstrants,” and the\r\nprosecution was conducted by “Jehan Levoisier, licenciate in law, the\r\ngrand mayor of the church and monastery of St. Martin de Laon of the order\r\nof Premonstrants and the aldermen of the same place.” The plaintiffs were\r\nthe friars, who preferred charges against the pig and procured the\r\nevidence necessary to its conviction. (_Vide_ Appendix O.)\r\n\r\nIn 1394, a pig was hanged at Mortaign for having sacrilegiously eaten a\r\nconsecrated wafer; and in a case of infanticide, it is expressly stated in\r\nthe plaintiff’s declaration that the pig killed the child and ate of its\r\nflesh, “although it was Friday,” and this violation of the _jejunium\r\nsextae_, prescribed by the Church, was urged by the prosecuting attorney\r\nand accepted by the court as a serious aggravation of the porker’s\r\noffence.\r\n\r\nNothing would be easier than to multiply examples of this kind.\r\nInfanticidal swine were hanged in 1419 at Labergement-le-Duc, in 1420 at\r\nBrochon, in 1435 at Trochères, and in 1490 at Abbeville; the\r\nlast-mentioned execution took place “under the auspices of the aldermanity\r\nand with the tolling of the bells.” It was evidently regarded as a very\r\nsolemn affair. The records of mediæval courts, the chronicles of mediæval\r\ncloisters, and the archives of mediæval cities, especially such as were\r\nunder episcopal sovereignty and governed by ecclesiastical law, are full\r\nof such cases. The capital punishment of a dumb animal for its crimes\r\nseems to us so irrational and absurd, that we can hardly believe that sane\r\nand sober men were ever guilty of such folly; yet the idea was quite\r\nfamiliar to our ancestors even in Shakespeare’s day, in the brilliant\r\nElizabethan age of English literature, as is evident from a passage in\r\nGratiano’s invective against Shylock:\r\n\r\n                          “thy currish spirit\r\n  Govern’d a wolf, who, hang’d for human slaughter,\r\n  Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,\r\n  And, whilst thou lay’st in thy unhallow’d dam,\r\n  Infus’d itself in thee; for thy desires\r\n  Are wolfish, bloody, starv’d, and ravenous.”\r\n\r\nThat such cases usually came under the jurisdiction of monasteries and\r\nso-called spiritualities and were tried by their peculiarly organized\r\ntribunals, will not seem strange, when we remember that these religious\r\nestablishments were great landed proprietors and at one time owned nearly\r\none-third of all real estate in France. The frequency with which pigs were\r\nbrought to trial and adjudged to death, was owing, in a great measure, to\r\nthe freedom with which they were permitted to run about the streets and to\r\ntheir immense number. The fact that they were under the special protection\r\nof St. Anthony of Padua conferred upon them a certain immunity, so that\r\nthey became a serious nuisance, not only endangering the lives of\r\nchildren, but also generating and disseminating diseases. It is recorded\r\nthat in 1131, as the Crown Prince Philippe, son of Louis the Gross, was\r\nriding through one of the principal streets of Paris, a boar, belonging to\r\nan abbot, ran violently between the legs of his horse, so that the prince\r\nfell to the ground and was killed. In some cities, like Grenoble in the\r\nsixteenth century, the authorities treated them very much as we do mad\r\ndogs, empowering the carnifex to seize and slay them whenever found at\r\nlarge. On Nov. 20, 1664, the municipality of Naples passed an ordinance\r\nthat the pigs, which frequented the streets and piazzas to the detriment\r\nand danger of the inhabitants, should be removed from the city to a wood\r\nor other uninhabited place or be slaughtered within twelve days on pain\r\nof the penalties already prescribed and threatened, probably in the order\r\nissued on Nov. 3, of the same year. It would seem, however, that these\r\nordinances did not produce the desired effect, or soon fell into abeyance,\r\nsince another was promulgated four years later, on Nov. 29, 1668,\r\nexpelling the pigs from the city and calling attention to the fact that\r\nthey corrupted the atmosphere and thus imperiled the public health.\r\nSanitary considerations and salutary measures of this kind were by no\r\nmeans common in the Middle Ages, but were a gradual outgrowth of the\r\nspirit of the Renaissance. It was with the revival of letters that men\r\nbegan to love cleanliness and to appreciate its hygienic value as well as\r\nits æsthetic beauty. Little heed was paid to such things in the “good old\r\ntimes” of earlier date, when the test of holiness was the number of years\r\na person went unwashed, and the growth of the soul in sanctity was\r\nestimated by the thickness of the layers of filth on the body, as the age\r\nof the earth is determined by the strata which compose its crust.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of the city almost universally enjoyed by mediæval swine is\r\nstill maintained by their descendants in many towns of Southern Italy and\r\nSicily, where they ramble at will through the streets or assemble in\r\ncouncil before the palace of the prefect (cf. D’Addosio, _Bestie\r\nDelinquenti_, pp. 23-5).\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the sixteenth century the tribunals began to take\r\npreventive measures against the public nuisance by holding the inhabitants\r\nresponsible for the injuries done to individuals by swine running at large\r\nand by threatening with corporal as well as pecuniary punishment all\r\npersons who left “such beasts without a good and sure guard.” Thus it is\r\nrecorded that on the 27th of March, 1567, “a sow with a black snout,” “for\r\nthe cruelty and ferocity” shown in murdering a little child four months\r\nold, having “eaten and devoured the head, the left hand and the part above\r\nthe right breast of the said infant,” was condemned to be “exterminated to\r\ndeath, and to this end to be hanged by the executioner of high justice on\r\na tree within the metes and bounds of the said judicature on the highway\r\nfrom Saint-Firmin to Senlis.” The court of the judicatory of Senlis, which\r\npronounced this sentence on complaint of the procurator of the seigniory\r\nof Saint-Nicolas, also forbade all the inhabitants and subjects of the\r\nsaid seignioralty to permit the like beasts to go unguarded on pain of an\r\narbitrary fine and of corporal chastisement in default of payment. (_Vide_\r\nAppendix P.)\r\n\r\nBut although pigs appear to have been the principal culprits, especially\r\nas regard infanticide, other quadrupeds were frequently called to answer\r\nfor similar crimes. Thus, in 1314, a bull belonging to a farmer in the\r\nvillage of Moisy, escaped into the highway, where it attacked a man and\r\ninjured him so severely that he died a few hours afterwards. The ferocious\r\nanimal was seized and imprisoned by the officers of Charles, Count of\r\nValois, and after being tried and convicted was sentenced to be hanged.\r\nThis judgment of the court was confirmed by the Parliament of Paris and\r\nthe execution took place at Moisy-le-Temple on the common gallows. An\r\nappeal based upon the incompetency of the court was then made by the\r\nProcurator of the Order of the Hospital of the Ville de Moisy to the\r\nParliament of La Chandeleur, which decided that the bull had met with its\r\ndeserts and been justly put to death, but that the Count of Valois had no\r\njurisdiction on the territory of Moisy, and his officials no power to\r\ninstitute proceedings in this case. The sentence was right in equity, but\r\njudicially and technically wrong, and could not therefore serve as a\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\nThere is also extant an order issued by the magistracy of Gisors in 1405,\r\ncommanding payment to be made to the carpenter who had erected the\r\nscaffold on which an ox had been executed “for its demerits.” Again on the\r\n16th of May, 1499, the judicial authorities of the Cistercian Abbey of\r\nBeaupré near Beauvais condemned a red bull to be “executed until death\r\ninclusively,” for having “killed with furiosity a lad of fourteen or\r\nfifteen years of age, named Lucas Dupont,” who was employed in tending the\r\nhorned cattle of the farmer Jean Boullet. (_Vide_ Appendix Q.) In 1389,\r\nthe Carthusians of Dijon caused a horse to be condemned to death for\r\nhomicide; and as late as 1697 a mare was burned by the decision and decree\r\nof the Parliament of Aix, which, it must be remembered, was not a\r\nlegislative body, but a supreme court of judicature, thus differing in its\r\nfunctions from the States General, the only law-making and representative\r\nassembly in France, that may be said to have corresponded in the slightest\r\ndegree to the modern conception of a parliament.\r\n\r\nIn 1474, the magistrates of Bâle sentenced a cock to be burned at the\r\nstake “for the heinous and unnatural crime of laying an egg.” The _auto da\r\nfé_ was held on a height near the city called the Kohlenberg, with as\r\ngreat solemnity as would have been observed in consigning a heretic to the\r\nflames, and was witnessed by an immense crowd of townsmen and peasants.\r\nThe statement made by Gross in his _Kurze Basler Chronik_, that the\r\nexecutioner on cutting open the cock found three more eggs in him, is of\r\ncourse absurd; we have to do in this case not with a freak of nature, but\r\nwith the freak of an excited imagination tainted with superstition. Other\r\ninstances of this kind have been recorded, one in the Swiss Prättigau as\r\nlate as 1730, although in many cases the execution of the gallinaceous\r\nmalefactor was more summary and less ceremonious than at Bâle.\r\n\r\nThe _oeuf coquatri_ was supposed to be the product of a very old cock and\r\nto furnish the most active ingredient of witch ointment. When hatched by a\r\nserpent or a toad, or by the heat of the sun it brought forth a cockatrice\r\nor basilisk, which would hide in the roof of the house and with its\r\nbaneful breath and “death-darting eye” destroy all the inmates. Many\r\nnaturalists believed this fable as late as the eighteenth century, and in\r\n1710 the French savant Lapeyronie deemed this absurd notion worthy of\r\nserious refutation, and read a paper, entitled “Observation sur les petits\r\noeufs de poule sans jaune, que l’on appelle vulgairement oeufs de Coq,”\r\nbefore the Academy of Sciences in order to prove that cocks never lay and\r\nthat the small and yolkless eggs attributed to them owe their peculiar\r\nshape and condition to a disease of the hen resulting in a hydropic\r\nmalformation of the oviduct. A farmer brought him several specimens of\r\nthis sort, somewhat larger than a pigeon’s egg, and assured him that they\r\nhad been laid by a cock in his own barnyard. On opening one of them, M.\r\nLapeyronie was surprised to find only a very slight trace of the yolk\r\nresembling “a small serpent coiled.” He now began to suspect that the cock\r\nmight be an hermaphrodite, but on killing and dissecting it discovered\r\nnothing in support of this theory, the internal organs being all perfectly\r\nhealthy and normal. But although the unfortunate chanticleer had fallen a\r\nvictim to the scientific investigation of a popular delusion, the eggs in\r\nquestion continued to be produced, until the farmer by carefully watching\r\nthe fowls detected the hen that laid them. The dissection showed that the\r\npressure of a bladder of serous fluid against the oviduct had so\r\ncontracted it, that the egg in passing had the yolk squeezed out of it,\r\nleaving merely a yellowish discoloration that looked like a worm. Another\r\npeculiarity of this hen was that she crowed like “a hoarse cock” (_un coq\r\nenroué_), only more violently; a phenomenon also a source of terror to the\r\nsuperstitious, but ascribed by M. Lapeyronie to the same morbid state of\r\nthe oviduct and the consequent pain caused by the passage of the egg\r\n(_Mémoires de l’Académie de Sciences._ Paris, 1710, pp. 553-60.)\r\n\r\nA Greek physiologus of the twelfth century, written in verse, calls the\r\nanimal hatched from the egg of an old cock επτεινάρια, a name which would\r\nimply some sort of winged creature. It was “sighted like the basilisk,”\r\nand endowed also in other respects with the same fatal qualities.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a valuable animal, such as an ox or a horse, the severity\r\nof retaliatory justice was often tempered by economical considerations and\r\nthe culprit confiscated, but not capitally punished. Thus as early as the\r\ntwelfth century it is expressly stated that “it is the law and custom in\r\nBurgundy that if an ox or a horse commit one or several homicides, it\r\nshall not be condemned to death, but shall be taken by the Seignior\r\nwithin whose jurisdiction the deed was perpetrated or by his servitors and\r\nbe confiscated to him and shall be sold and appropriated to the profit of\r\nthe said Seignior; but if other beasts or Jews do it, they shall be hanged\r\nby the hind feet” (Coustumes et Stilles de Bourgoigne, § 197 in Giraud:\r\n_Essai sur l’Histoire du Droit Francais_, II. p. 302; quoted by Amira). It\r\nwas a cruel irony of the law that conferred upon pigs and Jews a perfect\r\nequality of rights by sending them both to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nAnimals were put on a par with old crones in bearing their full share of\r\npersecution during the witchcraft delusion. Pigs suffered most in this\r\nrespect, since they were assumed to be peculiarly attractive to devils,\r\nand therefore particularly liable to diabolical possession, as is evident\r\nfrom the legion that went out of the lunatic and were permitted, at their\r\nown request, to enter into the Gadarene herd of swine. But Beelzebub did\r\nnot disdain to become incarnate in all sorts of creatures, such as cats,\r\ndogs of high and low degree, wolves, night-birds and indeed in any beast,\r\nespecially if it chanced to be black. Goats, it is well known, were not a\r\ntoo stinking habitation for him, and even to dwell in skunks he did not\r\ndespise. The perpetual smell of burning sulphur in his subterranean abode\r\nmay render him proof against any less suffocating form of stench. The\r\nBible represents Satan as going about as a roaring lion; and according to\r\nthe highest ecclesiastical authorities he has appeared visibly as a raven,\r\na porcupine, a toad and a gnat. Indeed, there is hardly a living creature\r\nin which he has not deigned to disport himself from a blue-bottle to a\r\nbishop, to say nothing of his “appearing invisibly at times” (_aliquando\r\ninvisibiliter apparens_), if we may believe what the learned polyhistor\r\nTritheim tells of his apparitions. As all animals were considered\r\nembodiments of devils, it was perfectly logical and consistent that the\r\nPrince of Darkness should reveal himself to mortal ken as a mongrel\r\nepitome of many beasts--snake, cat, dog, pig, ape, buck and horse each\r\ncontributing some characteristic part to his incarnation.\r\n\r\nIt was during the latter half of the seventeenth century, when, as we have\r\nseen, criminal prosecutions of animals were still quite frequent and the\r\npenalties inflicted extremely cruel, that Racine caricatured them in Les\r\nPlaideurs, where a dog is tried for stealing and eating a capon. Dandin\r\nsolemnly takes his seat as judge, and declares his determination to “close\r\nhis eyes to bribes and his ears to brigue.” Petit Jean prosecutes and\r\nL’Intime appears for the defence. Both address the court in florid and\r\nhigh-flown rhetoric and display rare erudition in quoting Aristotle,\r\nPausanias and other ancient as well as modern authorities. The accused is\r\ncondemned to the galleys. Thereupon the counsel for the defendant brings\r\nin a litter of puppies, _pauvres enfants qu’on veut rendre orphelins_, and\r\nappeals to the compassion and implores the clemency of the judge. Dandin’s\r\nfeelings are touched, for he, too, is a father; as a public officer, also,\r\nhe is moved by the economical consideration of the expense to the state of\r\nkeeping the offspring of the culprit in a foundling hospital, in case they\r\nshould be deprived of paternal support. To the contemporaries of Racine\r\nthe representation of a scene like this had a significance, which we fail\r\nto appreciate. It strikes us as simply farcical and not very funny; to\r\nthem it was a mirror reflecting a characteristic feature of the time and\r\nridiculing a grave judicial abuse, as Cervantes, a century earlier,\r\nburlesqued the institution of chivalry in the adventures of Don Quixote.\r\n(See Appendix R.)\r\n\r\n_Lex talionis_ is the oldest kind of law and the most deeply rooted in\r\nhuman nature. To the primitive man and the savage, tit for tat is an\r\nethical axiom, which it would be thought immoral as well as cowardly not\r\nto put into practice. No principle is held more firmly or acted upon more\r\nuniversally than that of literal and exact retributions in man’s dealings\r\nwith his fellows--the iron rule of doing unto others the wrongs which\r\nothers have done unto you. Hebrew legislation demanded “life for life, eye\r\nfor eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for\r\nburning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.” An old Anglo-Saxon law made\r\nthis retaliatory principle of _membrum pro membro_ the penalty of all\r\ncrimes of personal violence, including rape; even a lascivious eye was to\r\nbe plucked out, in accordance with the doctrine that “whosoever looketh on\r\na woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his\r\nheart.” [“Corruptor puniatur in eo in quo deliquat: oculos igitur amittat,\r\npropter aspectum decoris, quo virginem concupivit; amittat et testiculos,\r\nqui calorem stupri induxerunt.” Cf. Bracton, 147_b_; Reeves, I. 481.] This\r\nwas believed to be God’s method of punishment, smiting with disease or\r\nmiraculously destroying the bodily organs, which were the instruments of\r\nsin. Thus Stengelius (_De Judiciis Divinis_, II. 26, 27) records how a\r\nthunderbolt was hurled by the divine hand in such a manner as to castrate\r\na lascivious priest: _impurus et saltator sacerdos fulmine castratus_. The\r\nsame sort of retributive justice was recognized by the Institutes of Manu,\r\nwhich punished a thief by the amputation or mutilation of his fingers.\r\n\r\nIn the covenant with Noah it was declared that human blood should be\r\nrequired not only “at the hand of man,” but also “at the hand of every\r\nbeast;” and it was subsequently enacted, in accordance with this\r\nfundamental principle, that “if an ox gore a man or a woman that they die,\r\nthen the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten.” To\r\neat a creature which had become the peer of man in blood-guiltiness and in\r\njudicial punishment, would savour of anthropophagy. This decision of\r\nJewish law-givers as to the use of the flesh of otherwise edible animals\r\ncondemned to death for crime has nearly always been followed. Thus when,\r\nin 1553, several swine were executed for child-murder at Frankfort on the\r\nMain, their carcasses, although doubtless as good pork as could be found\r\nin the shambles, were thrown into the river. Usually, however, they were\r\nburied under the gallows or in whatever spot was set apart for interring\r\nthe dead bodies of human criminals. At Ghent, however, in 1578, after\r\njudicial sentence of death had been pronounced on a cow, she was\r\nslaughtered and her flesh sold as butcher’s meat, half of the proceeds of\r\nthe sale being given as compensation to the injured party and the other\r\nhalf to the city treasury for distribution among the poor; but her head\r\nwas struck off and stuck on a stake near the gallows, to indicate that she\r\nhad been capitally punished. The thrifty Flemings did not permit the moral\r\ndepravity to taint the material substance of the bovine culprit and impair\r\nthe excellence of the beef.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Law Faculty of the University of Leipsic decided\r\nthat a cow, which had pushed a woman and thereby caused her death at\r\nMachern in Saxony, July 20, 1621, should be taken to a secluded and\r\nbarren place and there killed and buried “unflayed.” In this case the\r\nflesh of the homicidal animal was not to be eaten nor the hide converted\r\ninto leather. (_Vide_ Appendix S.)\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be interesting to mention a decision of the\r\nEcclesiastical Court (_geistlicher Convent_) of Berne, given in 1666 and\r\nrecorded in Türler’s _Strafrechtliche Gutachten des geistlichen Konvents\r\nder Stadt Bern_ (_Zeitschrift für schweiz._ _Strafrecht_, Bd. III., Heft\r\n5. Quoted by Tobler). An insane man was tried for murder and the\r\nprosecutor seems to have urged that the lack of moral responsibility did\r\nnot suffice to relieve the accused of legal responsibility and to free him\r\nfrom punishment, citing as pertinent to the case the Mosaic law, which\r\ninflicted the death penalty on an ox for the like offence. On this point\r\nthe court replied: “In the first place, that specifically Jewish law is\r\nnot binding upon other governments, and is not observed by them either as\r\nregards oxen or horses. Again, even if the Jewish law should be really\r\napplicable to all men, it could not be appealed to in the present case,\r\nsince it is not permissible to draw an inference _a bove ad hominem_.\r\nInasmuch as no law is given to the ox, it cannot violate any, in other\r\nwords, cannot sin and therefore cannot be punished. On the other hand,\r\ndeath is a severe penalty for man. Nevertheless if God commanded that the\r\n‘goring ox’ should be killed, this was done in order to excite aversion to\r\nthe deed, to prevent the animal from injuring others, and in this manner\r\nto punish the owner of the beast. This fact, however, proves nothing\r\ntouching the case now before us; for, although God enacted a law for the\r\nox, he did not enact any for the insane man, and the distinction between\r\nthe goring ox and the maniac must be observed. An ox is created for man’s\r\nsake, and can therefore be killed for his sake; and in doing this there is\r\nno question of right or wrong as regards the ox; on the other hand, it is\r\nnot permissible to kill a man, unless he has deserved death as a\r\npunishment.” The remarkable points in this decision are, first, the\r\nabrogation of a biblical enactment by an ecclesiastical court of the\r\nseventeenth century, and, secondly, the discussion of a criminal act from\r\na psychiatrical point of view and the admission of extenuating and\r\nexculpating circumstances derived from this source.\r\n\r\nThe Koran holds every beast and fowl accountable for injuries done to\r\neach other, but reserves their punishment for the life to come. Among the\r\nKukis, if a man falls from a tree and is killed, it is the sacred duty of\r\nthe next of kin to fell the tree, and cut it up and scatter the chips\r\nabroad. The spirit of the tree was supposed to have caused the mishap, and\r\nthe blood of the slain was not thought to be thoroughly avenged until the\r\noffending object had been effaced from the earth. A survival of this\r\nnotion was the custom of burning heretics and flinging their ashes to the\r\nfour winds or casting them upon rivers running into the sea. The laws of\r\nDrakôn and Erechtheus required weapons and all other objects, by which a\r\nperson had lost his life, to be publicly condemned and thrown beyond the\r\nAthenian boundaries. This sentence of banishment, then regarded as one of\r\nthe severest that could be inflicted, was pronounced upon a sword, which\r\nhad killed a priest, the wielder of the same being unknown; and also upon\r\na bust of the elegiac poet Theognis, which had fallen on a man and caused\r\nhis death. Even in cases which, one would think, might be regarded as\r\njustifiable homicide in self-defence, no such ground of exculpation seems\r\nto have been admitted. Thus the statue erected by the Athenians in honour\r\nof the famous athlete, Nikôn of Thasos, was assailed by his envious foes\r\nand pushed from its pedestal. In falling it crushed one of its assailants,\r\nand was therefore brought before the proper tribunal and sentenced to be\r\ncast into the sea. Judicial proceedings of this kind were called ἄψῦχων\r\nδίκαι (prosecutions of lifeless things) and were conducted before the\r\nAthenian law-court known as the Prytaneion; they are alluded to by\r\nÆschines, Pausanias, Demosthenes, and other writers, and briefly described\r\nin the _Onomasticon_ of Julius Pollux and the _Lexicon Decem Oratorum\r\nGraecorum_ of Valerius Harpokration.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the term ἄψῦχων should be applied only to an inanimate\r\nobject and not to the brute, which was more correctly called ἄφωνον\r\n(dumb); but this distinction was not always observed either in common\r\nparlance or in legal phraseology. The law on this point as formulated and\r\nexpounded by Plato (_De Leg._, IX. 12) was as follows: “If a draught\r\nanimal or any other beast kill a person, unless it be in a combat\r\nauthorized and instituted by the state, the kinsmen of the slain shall\r\nprosecute the said homicide for murder, and the overseers of the public\r\nlands (ἀγρονόμοι), as many as may be commissioned by the said kinsmen,\r\nshall adjudicate upon the case and send the offender beyond the boundaries\r\nof the country (ἐξορίζειν, exterminate in the literal and original sense\r\nof the term). If a lifeless thing shall deprive a person of life, provided\r\nit may not be a thunderbolt (κεραυνός) or other missile (βέλος) hurled by\r\na god, but an object which the said person may have run against or by\r\nwhich he may have been struck and slain, then the kinsman immediate to the\r\ndeceased shall appoint the nearest neighbour as judge in order to purify\r\nhimself as well as his next of kin from blood-guiltiness, but the culprit\r\n(τὸ ὄφλον) shall be put beyond the boundaries, in the same manner as if it\r\nwere an animal.” In the same section it is enacted that if a person be\r\nfound dead and the murderer be unknown, then proclamation shall be made by\r\na herald on the market-place forbidding the murderer to enter any\r\nsanctuary or the land of the slain, and declaring that, if discovered, he\r\nshall be put to death and his body be thrown unburied beyond the\r\nboundaries of the country of the person killed. The object of these\r\nmeasures was to appease the Erinnys or avenging spirit of the deceased,\r\nand to avert the calamities which would otherwise be brought upon the\r\nland, in accordance with the strict law of retribution demanding blood for\r\nblood, no matter whether it may have been shed wilfully or accidentally.\r\n[Cf. Æschylus, _Cho._, 395, where this law (νόμος) is clearly and strongly\r\naffirmed.] The same superstitious feeling leads the hunters of many savage\r\ntribes to beg pardon of bears and other wild animals for killing them and\r\nto purify themselves by religious rites from the taint incurred by such an\r\nact, the μίασμα of murder, as the Greeks called it.\r\n\r\nQuite recently in China fifteen wooden idols were tried and condemned to\r\ndecapitation for having caused the death of a man of high military rank.\r\nOn complaint of the family of the deceased the viceroy residing at Fouchow\r\nordered the culprits to be taken out of the temple and brought before the\r\ncriminal court of that city, which after due process of law sentenced them\r\nto have their heads severed from their bodies and then to be thrown into a\r\npond. The execution is reported to have taken place in the presence of a\r\nlarge concourse of approving spectators and “amid the loud execrations of\r\nthe masses,” who seem in their excitement to have “lost their heads” as\r\nwell as the hapless deities.\r\n\r\nWhen the Russian prince Dimitri, the son of Ivan II., was assassinated on\r\nMay 15, 1591, at Uglich, his place of exile, the great bell of that town\r\nrang the signal of insurrection. For this serious political offence the\r\nbell was sentenced to perpetual banishment in Siberia, and conveyed with\r\nother exiles to Tobolsk. After a long period of solitary confinement it\r\nwas partially purged of its iniquity by conjuration and re-consecration\r\nand suspended in the tower of a church in the Siberian capital; but not\r\nuntil 1892 was it fully pardoned and restored to its original place in\r\nUglich. A like sentence was imposed by a Russian tribunal on a butting ram\r\nin the latter half of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nMathias Abele von Lilienberg, in his _Metamorphosis Telae Judiciariae_, of\r\nwhich the eighth edition was published at Nuremberg in 1712, states that a\r\ndrummer’s dog in an Austrian garrison town bit a member of the municipal\r\ncouncil in the right leg. The drummer was sued for damages, but refused to\r\nbe responsible for the snappish cur and delivered it over to the arm of\r\njustice. Thereupon he was released, and the dog sentenced to one year’s\r\nincarceration in the Narrenkötterlein, a sort of pillory or iron cage\r\nstanding on the market-place, in which blasphemers, evil-livers, rowdies\r\nand other peace-breakers were commonly confined. [The Narrenkötterlein,\r\nNarrenköderl or Kotter formerly on the chief public squares in Vienna are\r\ndescribed as “Menschenkäfige mit Gittern von Eisen und Holz, bestimmt das\r\ndarin versperrte Individuum dem Spotte des Pöbels preiszugeben (zu\r\nnarren).” Schläger: _Wiener Skizzen aus dem Mittelalter_, II. 245.]\r\nMornacius also relates that several mad dogs, which attacked and tore in\r\npieces a Franciscan novice in 1610, were “by sentence and decree of the\r\ncourt put to death.” It is surely reasonable enough that mad dogs should\r\nbe killed; the remarkable feature of the case is that they should be\r\nformally tried and convicted as murderers by a legal tribunal, and that no\r\naccount should have been taken of their rabies as an extenuating\r\ncircumstance or ground of acquittal. In such a case the plea of insanity\r\nwould certainly seem to be naturally suggested and perfectly valid.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is expressly declared in the Avesta that a mad dog\r\nshall not be permitted to plead insanity in exculpation of itself, but\r\nshall be “punished with the punishment of a conscious and premeditated\r\noffence” (_baodho-varsta_), _i.e._ by progressive mutilation,\r\ncorresponding to the number of persons or beasts it has bitten, beginning\r\nwith the loss of its ears, extending to the crippling of its feet and\r\nending with the amputation of its tail. This cruel and absurd enactment is\r\nwholly inconsistent with the kindly spirit shown in the Avesta towards all\r\nanimals recognized as the creatures of Ahuramazda, and especially with the\r\nmany measures taken by the Indo-Aryans as a pastoral people for the\r\nprotection of the dog. Indeed, a paragraph immediately following in the\r\nsame chapter commands the Mazdayasnians to treat such a rabid dog\r\nhumanely, and to “wait upon him with medicaments and to try to heal him,\r\njust as they would care for a righteous man.” On this important point\r\nAvestan legislation is so inconsistent and self-contradictory that one may\r\njustly suspect the harsh enactments to be later interpolations.\r\n\r\nA curious example of imputed crime and its penal consequences is seen in\r\nthe Roman custom of celebrating the anniversary of the preservation of the\r\nCapitol from the night-attack of the Gauls, not only by paying honour to\r\nthe descendants of the sacred geese, whose cries gave warning of the\r\nenemy’s approach, adorning them with jewels and carrying them about in\r\nlitters, but also by crucifying a dog, as a punishment for the want of\r\nvigilance shown by its progenitors on that occasion. This imputation of\r\nmerit and demerit was really no more absurd than to visit the sins of the\r\nfathers on the children, as prescribed by Jewish and other ancient\r\nlawgivers, or to decree corruption of blood in persons attainted of\r\ntreason, as is still the practice of modern states, or any other theory of\r\ninherited guilt or scheme of vicarious atonement, that sets the sin of the\r\nfederal head of the race to the account of his remotest posterity and\r\nrelieves them from its penalties only through the suffering and death of\r\na wholly innocent person. They are all applications of the barbarous\r\nprinciple, which, in primitive society, with its gross conceptions of\r\njustice, made the entire tribe responsible for the conduct of each of its\r\nmembers. The vendetta, which continues to be the unwritten but inviolable\r\ncode of many semi-civilized communities, is based upon the same conception\r\nof consanguineous solidarity for the perpetration and avenging of crime.\r\n\r\nAccording to an old Anglo-Saxon law, abolished by King Canute, in case\r\nstolen property was found in the house of a thief, his wife and family,\r\neven to the infant in the cradle, though it had never taken food (_peâh\r\nhit nafre metes ne âbîte_), were punished as partakers of his guilt. The\r\n_Schwabenspiegel_, the oldest digest of South German law, treated as\r\naccessaries all the domestic animals found in a house, in which a crime of\r\nviolence had been committed, and punished them with death. [“Man soll\r\nallez daz tötden daz in den huze ist gevonden: leuten und vie, ros und\r\nrinder, hunde und katzen, ganzen und hundre.” § 290.]\r\n\r\nCicero approved of such penalties for political crimes as “severe but wise\r\nenactments, since the father is thereby bound to the interests of the\r\nstate by the strongest of ties, namely, love for his children.” Roman law\r\nunder the empire punished treason with death and then added: “As to the\r\nsons of traitors, they ought to suffer the same penalty as their parents,\r\nsince it is highly probable that they will sometime be guilty of the same\r\ncrime themselves; nevertheless, as a special act of clemency, we grant\r\nthem their lives, but, at the same time, declare them to be incapable of\r\ninheriting anything from father or mother or of receiving any gift or\r\nbequest in consequence of any devise or testament of kinsmen or friends.\r\nBranded with hereditary infamy and excluded from all hope of honour or of\r\nproperty, may they suffer the torture of disgrace and poverty until they\r\nshall look upon life as a curse and long for death as a kind release.”\r\nThis atrocious edict of the emperors Arcadius and Honorius has its\r\ncounterpart in the still more radical code of Pachacutez, the Justinian of\r\nthe ancient Peruvians, which punished adultery with the wife of an Inca by\r\nputting to death not only the adulteress and her seducer, but also the\r\nchildren, slaves and kindred of the culprits, as well as all the\r\ninhabitants of the city in which the crime was committed, while the city\r\nitself was to be razed and the site covered with stones.\r\n\r\nThe principle enunciated by Cicero has also been accepted by modern\r\nlegislators as applicable to high treason. Thus, when Tschech, the\r\nburgomaster of Storkow, attempted to take the life of Frederic William of\r\nPrussia, July 26, 1844, he was tried and executed Dec. 14 of the same\r\nyear. On the day after his execution his only daughter, Elizabeth, was\r\narrested, and to her inquiry by what right she had been deprived of her\r\nfreedom, the authorities replied that, “according to Prussian law the\r\nchildren of a person convicted of high treason and all the members of his\r\nfamily, especially if they seemed to be dangerous and to share the\r\nopinions of their father, can be imprisoned for life or banished from the\r\ncountry.” The young lady was then exiled to Westphalia, and there placed\r\nin the custody of an extremely austere parson, until she finally escaped\r\nto France, and afterwards to Switzerland, where she spent the rest of her\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nWhen the prefects Tatian and Proculus fell into disgrace, Lycia, their\r\nnative land, was deprived of the autonomy it had hitherto enjoyed as a\r\nRoman province, and its inhabitants were disfranchised and declared\r\nincapable of holding any office under the empire. So, too, when Joshua\r\ndiscovered some of the spoils of Jericho hidden in the tent of Achan, not\r\nonly the thief himself, but also “his sons, and his daughters, and his\r\noxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had,”\r\nwere brought into the valley of Achor, and there stoned with stones and\r\nburned with fire. About this time, however, such holocausts of justice\r\nwere suppressed among the Jews, and a law enacted that henceforth “the\r\nfathers shall not be put to death, for the children, neither shall the\r\nchildren be put to death for the fathers, every man shall be put to death\r\nfor his own sin;” or, as Jeremiah expresses it figuratively, the\r\nchildren’s teeth were to be no longer set on edge by the sour grapes\r\nwhich their fathers had eaten. Yet the persistency of time-honoured custom\r\nand its power of overriding new statutes are seen in the fact that,\r\nseveral centuries later, at the request of the Gibeonites, whom it had\r\nbecome desirable to conciliate, David did not scruple to deliver up to\r\nthem seven of Saul’s sons to be hanged for the evil which their father had\r\nwrought in slaying these foes of Israel. It would have been a parallel\r\ncase if Bismarck had sought to win the friendship and favour of the French\r\nby giving into their hands the descendants of Blücher to be guillotined on\r\nthe Place de la Concorde, or, after having made a political pilgrimage to\r\nCanossa, should surrender the children of Dr. Falk to be racked and burned\r\nat the stake by the ultramontanes.\r\n\r\nAccording to the current orthodox theology, treason against God, committed\r\nby our common progenitor, worked “corruption of blood” in the whole human\r\nrace, all the children of men being attainted with guilt in consequence of\r\nthe act of their first parent. This crude and brutal conception of justice\r\nis the survival of a primitive and barbarous state of society, and it is\r\ncurious to observe how the most highly civilized peoples, who have\r\noutgrown this notion and set it aside in the secular relations of man to\r\nman, still cling to it as something sacred and sublime in the spiritual\r\nrelations of man to the deity. Only the all-wise and all-powerful\r\nsovereign of the universe is supposed to continue to administer law and\r\njustice on principles which common-sense and the enlightened opinion of\r\nmankind have long since abrogated and banished from earthly legislation.\r\nThus the divine government, instead of keeping pace with the progress of\r\nhuman institutions, still corresponds to the ideals of right and\r\nretribution entertained by savage tribes and the lowest types of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe horrible mutilations to which criminals were formerly subjected,\r\noriginated in an endeavour to administer strictly even-handed justice.\r\nWhat could be fairer or more fit than to punish perjury by cutting off the\r\ntwo fingers which the perjurer had held up in taking the violated oath? It\r\nwas a popular belief that the fingers of an undetected perjurer would grow\r\nout of the grave after death, seeking retributive amputation, as a plant\r\nseeks the light, and that his ghost would never rest until this penalty\r\nhad been inflicted. (See Heinrich Roch: _Schles. Chron._, p. 267, where a\r\ncase of this kind is recorded.) The Carolina (_constitutio criminalis\r\nCarolina_), although in many respects an advance on mediæval penal\r\nlegislation, doomed incendiaries to be burned alive; and an old law, cited\r\nby Döpler (_Theat. Poen._, II. 271), condemned a man who had dug up and\r\nremoved a boundary stone to be buried in the earth up to his neck and to\r\nhave his head plowed off with a new plow, thus symbolizing in his own\r\nperson the grave offence which he had committed. Ivan Basilovitch, a\r\nMuscovite prince, ordered that an ambassador, who did not uncover in his\r\npresence, should have his hat nailed to his head; and it is a feeble\r\nsurvival of the same idea of proper punishment that makes the American\r\nfarmer nail the dead hawk to his barn-door, just as in former times it was\r\ncustomary to crucify highway robbers at cross-roads.\r\n\r\nAccording to an old Roman law ascribed to Numa Pompilius, the oxen which\r\nplowed up a boundary stone, as well as their driver, were sacrificed to\r\nJupiter Terminus. In the early development of agriculture, and the\r\ntransition from communal to personal property in land, this severe\r\nenactment was deemed necessary to the protection of the “sacra saxa,” by\r\nwhich the boundary lines of the fields were defined. Only by making the\r\nviolation of enclosed ground a sacrilege was it possible to prevent\r\nencroachments upon it, so strong was the lingering prejudice against\r\nindividual possessions of this kind running in the blood of a people\r\ndescended from nomadic tribes of herdsmen, who regarded sedentary\r\ncommunities engaged in tilling the soil as their direst foes. The lawgiver\r\nknew very well that the oxen were involuntary agents, and that the plowman\r\nalone was culpable; but when a religious atonement is to be made and an\r\nangry god appeased, moral distinctions determining degrees of\r\nresponsibility are uniformly ignored, and the innocent are doomed to\r\nsuffer with the guilty. The oxen were tainted by the performance of an\r\nact, in which the exercise of their will was not involved, and must\r\ntherefore be consigned to the offended deity. The same is true of the\r\nplowman, who did not escape immolation even when the _motio termini_ or\r\ndisplacement of the boundary stone occurred unintentionally.\r\n\r\nThat the feeling, which found expression in such enactments and usages and\r\nsurvives in schemes of expiation and vicarious sacrifice, lies scarcely\r\nskin-deep under the polished surface of our civilization, is evident from\r\nthe force and suddenness with which it breaks out under strong excitement,\r\nas when Cincinnati rioters burn the court-house because they suspect the\r\njudges of venality and are dissatisfied with the verdicts of the juries.\r\nThe primitive man and the savage, like the low and ignorant masses of\r\ncivilized communities, do not take into consideration whether the objects\r\nfrom which they suffer injury are intelligent agents or not, but wreak\r\ntheir vengeance on stocks and stones and brutes, obeying only the rude\r\ninstinct of revenge. The power of restraining these aboriginal\r\npropensities, and of nicely analyzing actions and studying mental\r\nconditions in order to ascertain degrees of moral responsibility,\r\npresupposes a high degree of mental development and refinement and great\r\nacuteness of psychological perception, and is, in fact, only a recent\r\nacquisition of a small minority of the human race. The vast bulk of\r\nmankind will have to pass through a long process of intellectual\r\nevolution, and rise far above their present place in the ascending scale\r\nof culture before they attain it.\r\n\r\nFor this reason Lombroso would abolish trial by jury, which seems to him\r\nnot a sign of progress towards better judicatory methods, but a clumsy\r\nsurvival of primitive justice as administered by barbarous tribes and even\r\ngregarious animals. It makes the administration of justice dependent upon\r\npopular prejudice and passion, and finds its most violent expression or\r\nexplosion in lynch law, which is only trial by a jury of the whole\r\ncommunity gone mad. It would certainly be a dismal farce to apply to the\r\ncriminal classes the principle that every man must be judged by his peers.\r\nIn the cantonal courts of Switzerland the verdict of the jury is uniformly\r\nin favour of the native against the foreigner, no matter what the merits\r\nof the case may be; and this outrageous perversion of right and equity is\r\ncalled patriotism, a term which conveniently sums up and euphemizes the\r\ngeneral sentiment of Helvetian innkeepers and tradesmen that “the stranger\r\nwithin their gates” is their legitimate spoil, and has no other _raison\r\nd’être_. In Italy, especially in Naples and Sicily, a thief may be\r\nsometimes condemned, but a murderer is almost invariably acquitted by the\r\njury, whose decision expresses the corrupted moral sense of a people\r\naccustomed to admire the bandit as a hero and to consider brigandage a\r\nhighly honourable profession.\r\n\r\nThe childish disposition to punish irrational creatures and inanimate\r\nobjects, which is common to the infancy of individuals and of races, has\r\nleft a distinct trace of itself in that peculiar institution of English\r\nlaw known as deodand, and derived partly from Jewish and partly from old\r\nGerman usages and traditions. “If a horse,” says Blackstone, “or any other\r\nanimal, of its own motion kill as well an infant as an adult, or if a cart\r\nrun over him, they shall in either case be forfeited as deodand.” If a\r\nman, in driving a cart, tumble to the ground and lose his life by the\r\nwheel passing over him, if a tree fall on a man and cause his death, or if\r\na horse kick his keeper and kill him, then the wheel, the tree and the\r\nhorse are deodands _pro rege_, and are to be sold for the benefit of the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n_Omnia quae movent ad mortem sunt Deo danda_ is the principle laid down by\r\nBracton. If therefore a cart-wheel run over a man and kill him, not only\r\nis the wheel, but also the whole cart to be declared deodand, because the\r\nmomentum of the cart in motion contributed to the man’s death; but if the\r\nshaft fall upon a man and kill him, then only the shaft is deodand, since\r\nthe cart did not participate in the crime. It is also stated, curiously\r\nenough, that if an infant fall from a cart not in motion and be killed,\r\nneither the horse nor the cart shall be declared deodand; not so,\r\nhowever, if an adult come to his death in this manner. The ground of this\r\ndistinction is not quite clear; although it may arise from the assumption\r\nthat the child had no business there, or that such an accident could not\r\nhave happened to an adult, unless there was something irregular and\r\nperverse in the conduct of the animal or the vehicle. In the archives of\r\nMaryland, edited by Dr. William Hand Browne and Miss Harrison in 1887,\r\nmention is made of an inquest held January 31, 1637, on the body of a\r\nplanter, who “by the fall of a tree had his bloud bulke broken.” “And\r\nfurthermore the Jurors aforesaid upon their oath aforesaid say that the\r\nsaid tree moved to the death of the said John Bryant; and therefore find\r\nthe said tree forfeited to the Lord Proprietor.”\r\n\r\nAccording to an old Anglo-Saxon law a sword or other object by which a man\r\nhad been slain, was not regarded as pure (_gesund_) until the crime had\r\nbeen expiated, and therefore could not be used, but must be set apart as a\r\nsacrifice. A sword-cutler would not take such a weapon to polish or repair\r\nwithout a certificate that it was _gesund_ or free from homicidal taint,\r\nso as not to render himself liable for any harm it might inflict, since it\r\nwas supposed to exert a certain magical and malicious influence. Also an\r\nancient municipal law of the city of Schleswig stipulated that the builder\r\nof a house should be held responsible in case any one should be killed by\r\na beam, block, rafter or other piece of timber, and pay a fine of nine\r\nmarks, or give the object that had committed the manslaughter to the\r\nfamily or kinsmen of the slain. If he failed to do so and built the\r\ncontaminated timber into the edifice, then the owner had to atone for the\r\nhomicide with the whole house. (Cf. Heinrich Brunner: _Deutsche\r\nRechtsgeschichte_, II. p. 557, Anm. 31.) A modern survival of this legal\r\nprinciple is the notion, current especially among criminals, that any part\r\nof the body of a deceased person, or better still of an executed murderer,\r\nexerts a magical and protective power or brings good luck. It is by no\r\nmeans uncommon among the peasants and lower classes of Europe to put the\r\nfinger of a dead thief under the threshold in order to protect the house\r\nhomœpathically against theft. The persistency of this superstition is\r\nshown by the fact that a farmer’s hired man named Sier and belonging to\r\nthe hamlet of Heumaden, was tried at Weiden in Bavaria, May 23, 1894, and\r\nconvicted of having exhumed the body of a newly buried child in the\r\nchurchyard of Moosbach and taken out one of its eyes, which he supposed\r\nwould render him invisible to mortal sight like the famous _tarnkappe_ of\r\nold German mythology, and thus enable him to indulge with impunity his\r\npropensity to steal. For this sacrilege he was sentenced to one year and\r\ntwo months’ imprisonment and to the loss of civil rights for three years.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Scottish islands it is the custom to beach a boat, from\r\nwhich a fisherman had been drowned, cursing it for its misdeed and\r\nletting it dry and fall to pieces in the sun. The boat is guilty of\r\nmanslaughter and must no longer be permitted to sail the sea with innocent\r\ncraft. Scotch law does not seem to have recognized deodand in the strictly\r\netymological sense of the term, but only escheat, in other words, the\r\nconfiscated objects were not necessarily applied to pious purposes--_pro\r\nanima regis et omnium fidelium defunctorum_--but were simply forfeited to\r\nthe king or to the state. This form of confiscation never prevailed so\r\ngenerally in Central and Eastern, as in Western Europe. Some German\r\ncommunities and territorial sovereigns introduced it from France, but so\r\nmodified the practical application of the principle as to award to the\r\ninjured party the greater portion, in Lüneburg, for example, two-thirds of\r\nthe value of the confiscated animal or object. (_Vide_ Kraut’s _Stadtrecht\r\nvon Lüneburg_, No. XCVII. Cited by Von Amira, p. 594.)\r\n\r\nBlackstone’s theories of the origin of deodands are exceedingly vague and\r\nunsatisfactory. Evidently the learned author of the _Commentaries_ could\r\ngive no consistent explanation of these vestiges of ancient criminal\r\nlegislation. His statement that they were intended to punish the owner of\r\nthe forfeited property for his negligence, and his further assertion that\r\nthey were “designed, in the blind days of popery, as an expiation for the\r\nsouls of such as were snatched away by sudden death,” are equally\r\nincorrect. In most cases the owner was perfectly innocent and very\r\nfrequently was himself the victim of the accident. He suffered only\r\nincidentally from a penalty imposed for a wholly different purpose, just\r\nas a slaveholder incurs loss when his human chattel commits murder and is\r\nhanged for it. The primal object was to atone for the taking of life in\r\naccordance with certain crude conceptions of retribution. Under\r\nhierarchical governments the prominent idea was to appease the wrath of\r\nGod, who otherwise might visit mankind with famine and pestilence and\r\ndivers retaliatory scourges. For the same reason the property of a suicide\r\nwas deodand. Thus the wife and children of the deceased, who may be\r\nsupposed to have already suffered most from the fatal act, were subjected\r\nto additional punishment for it by being robbed of their rightful\r\ninheritance. Yet this was by no means the intention of the lawmakers, who\r\nsimply wished to prescribe an adequate atonement for a grievous offence,\r\nand in seeking to accomplish this main purpose, ignored the effect of\r\ntheir action upon the fortunes of the heirs or deemed it a matter of minor\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAncient legislators uniformly regarded a _felo de se_ as a criminal\r\nagainst society and treated him as a kind of traitor. The man had enjoyed\r\nthe support and protection of the body-politic during his infancy and\r\nyouth, and, by taking his own life, he shook off the responsibilities and\r\nshirked the duties devolving upon him as an adult member of the\r\ncommonwealth. This is why self-murder was called felony and as such\r\ninvolved forfeiture of goods. Calchas would not permit the body of “the\r\nmad Ajax,” who died by his own hand, to be burned; and the Christian\r\nChurch of to-day refuses to bury in consecrated ground with religious\r\nrites any person who deliberately cuts short the thread of his existence\r\nand thus commits treason against the Most High. The Athenians\r\nignominiously lopped off the hand of a suicide and buried the guilty\r\ninstrument of his death, as an accursed thing, apart from the rest of the\r\ninterred or incremated body. In some communities all persons over sixty\r\nyears of age have been left free to kill themselves, if they wished to do\r\nso. They had performed the duties of citizenship and of procreation and\r\nwere permitted to retire in this way, if they saw fit. In very ancient\r\ntimes, the magistrates of Massalia (Marseilles, then a Greek colony) are\r\nsaid to have kept on hand a supply of poison to be given to any citizen,\r\nwho, on due examination, was found to have good and sufficient reason for\r\ntaking his own life. Suicide was thus legalized and facilitated, and\r\nthereby rendered honourable, and was perhaps found more convenient and\r\neconomical than to grant pensions or to support paupers. It was a summary\r\nmethod of getting rid of those who had finished the struggle for existence\r\nor failed in it, and in either case might be a burden to themselves or to\r\nthe state. On the other hand, when a suicidal mania seized upon the\r\nmaidens of Miletos, an Ionian city in Caria, and threatened to produce a\r\ndearth of wives and mothers, the municipal authorities decreed that the\r\nbodies of all such persons should be exposed naked in the market-place, in\r\norder that virgin modesty and shame might overcome the desire of death,\r\nand check a self-destructive passion extremely detrimental to the Milesian\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nIt is true, as Blackstone asserts, that the Church claimed deodands as her\r\ndue and put the price of them into her own coffers; but this fact does not\r\nexplain their origin. They were an expression of the same feeling that led\r\nthe public authorities to fill up a well, in which a person had been\r\ndrowned, not as a precautionary measure, but as a solemn act of expiation;\r\nor that condemned and confiscated a ship, which, by lurching, had thrown a\r\nman overboard and caused his death.\r\n\r\nDeodands were not abolished in England until the reign of Queen Victoria.\r\nWith the exception of some vestiges of primitive legislation still\r\nlingering in maritime law, they are, in modern codes, one of the latest\r\napplications of a penal principle, which, in Athens, expatriated stocks\r\nand stones, and in other countries of Europe excommunicated bugs and sent\r\nbeasts to the stake and to the gallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMEDIÆVAL AND MODERN PENOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nA striking and significant indication of the remarkable change that has\r\ncome over the spirit of legislation, and more especially of criminal\r\njurisprudence, in comparatively recent times, is the fact that whereas, a\r\nfew generations ago, lawgivers and courts of justice still continued to\r\ntreat brutes as men responsible for their misdeeds, and to punish them\r\ncapitally as malefactors, the tendency now-a-days is to regard men as\r\nbrutes, acting automatically or under an insane and irresistible impulse\r\nto evil, and to plead this innate and constitutional proclivity, in\r\nprosecution for murder, as an extenuating or even wholly exculpating\r\ncircumstance. Some persons even maintain, as we have already seen, that\r\nsuch criminals are diabolically possessed and thus account for their\r\ninveterate and otherwise incredible perversity on the theory held by the\r\nhighest authorities in the Middle Ages concerning the nature of noxious\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nMediæval jurists and judges did not stop to solve intricate problems of\r\npsycho-pathology nor to sift the expert evidence of the psychiater. The\r\nlegal maxim: _Si duo faciunt idem non est idem_ (if two do the same thing,\r\nit is not the same) was too fine a distinction for them, even when one of\r\nthe doers was a brute beast. The puzzling knots, which we seek painfully\r\nto untie and often succeed only in hopelessly tangling, they boldly cut\r\nwith executioner’s sword. They dealt directly with overt acts and\r\nadministered justice with a rude and retaliative hand, more accustomed and\r\nbetter adapted to clinch a fist and strike a blow than to weigh motives\r\nnicely in a balance, to measure gradations of culpability, or to detect\r\ndelicate differences in the psychical texture and spiritual qualities of\r\ndeeds. They put implicit faith in Jack Cade’s prescription of “hempen\r\ncaudle” and “pap of hatchet” as radical remedies for all forms and degrees\r\nof criminal alienation and murderous aberration of mind. Phlebotomy was\r\nthe catholicon of the physician and the craze of the jurist; blood-letting\r\nwas regarded as the only infallible cure for all the ills that afflict the\r\nhuman and the social body. Doctors of physic and doctors of law vied with\r\neach other in applying this panacea. The red-streaked pole of the\r\nbarber-surgeon and the reeking scaffold, symbols of venesection as a means\r\nof promoting the physical and moral health of the community, were the\r\nappropriate signs of medicine and jurisprudence. Hygeia and Justicia,\r\ninstead of being represented by graceful females feeding the emblematic\r\nserpent of recuperation or holding with firm and even hand the well-poised\r\nscales of equity, would have been more fitly typified by two enormous\r\nleeches gorged with blood.\r\n\r\nEven the dead, who should have been hanged, but escaped their due\r\npunishment, could not rest in their graves until the corpse had suffered\r\nthe proper legal penalty at the hands of the public executioner. Their\r\nrestless ghosts wandered about as vampires or other malicious spooks until\r\ntheir crimes had been expiated by digging up their bodies and suspending\r\nthem from the gallows. Culprits, who died on the rack or in prison, were\r\nbrought to the scaffold as though they were still alive. In 1685, a\r\nwere-wolf, supposed to be the incarnation of a deceased burgomaster of\r\nAnsbach, did much harm in the neighbourhood of that city, preying upon the\r\nherds and even devouring women and children. With great difficulty the\r\nravenous beast was finally killed; its carcass was then clad in a tight\r\nsuit of flesh-coloured cere-cloth, resembling in tint the human skin, and\r\nadorned with a chestnut brown wig and a long whitish beard; the snout of\r\nthe beast was cut off and a mask of the burgomaster’s features substituted\r\nfor it, and the counterfeit presentment thus produced was hanged by order\r\nof the court. The pelt of the strangely transmogrified wolf was stuffed\r\nand preserved in the margrave’s cabinet of curiosities as a memorial of\r\nthe marvellous event and as ocular proof of the existence of were-wolves.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary and the Slavic countries of Eastern Europe the public execution\r\nof vampires was formerly of frequent occurrence, and the superstition,\r\nwhich gave rise to such proceedings, still prevails among the rural\r\npopulation of those semi-civilized lands. In 1337, a herdsman near the\r\ntown of Cadan came forth from his grave every night, visiting the\r\nvillages, terrifying the inhabitants, conversing affably with some and\r\nmurdering others. Every person, with whom he associated, was doomed to die\r\nwithin eight days and to wander as a vampire after death. In order to keep\r\nhim in his grave a stake was driven through his body, but he only laughed\r\nat this clumsy attempt to impale a ghost, saying: “You have really\r\nrendered me a great service by providing me with a staff, with which to\r\nward off the dogs when I go out to walk.” At length it was decided to give\r\nhim over to two public executioners to be burned. We are informed that\r\nwhen the fire began to take effect, “he drew up his feet, bellowed for a\r\nwhile like a bull and hee-hawed like an ass, until one of the executioners\r\nstabbed him in the side, so that the blood oozed out and the evil finally\r\nceased.”\r\n\r\nAgain in 1345, in the town of Lewin, a potter’s wife, who was reputed to\r\nbe a witch, died and, owing to suspicions of her pact with Satan, was\r\nrefused burial in consecrated ground and dumped into a ditch like a dog.\r\nThe event proved that she was not a good Christian, for instead of\r\nremaining quietly in her grave, such as it was, she roamed about in the\r\nform of divers unclean beasts, causing much terror and slaying sundry\r\npersons. Thereupon she was exhumed and it was found that she had chewed\r\nand swallowed one half of her face-cloth, which, on being pulled out of\r\nher throat, showed stains of blood. A stake was driven through her breast,\r\nbut this precautionary measure only made matters worse. She now walked\r\nabroad with the stake in her hand and killed quite a number of people with\r\nthis formidable weapon. She was then taken up a second time and burned,\r\nwhereupon she ceased from troubling. The efficacy of this post-mortem\r\n_auto da fé_ was accepted as conclusive proof that her neighbours had\r\nneglected to perform their whole religious duty in not having burned her\r\nwhen she was alive, and were thus punished for their remissness.\r\n\r\nDöpler cites also the case of Stephen Hübner of Trautenau, who wandered\r\nabout after death as a vampire, frightening and strangling several\r\nindividuals. By order of the court his body was disinterred and\r\ndecapitated under the gallows-tree. When his head was struck off, a stream\r\nof blood spurted forth, although he had been already five months buried.\r\nHis remains were reduced to ashes and nothing more was heard of him.\r\n\r\nIn 1573, the parliament of Dôle published a decree permitting the\r\ninhabitants of the Franche Comté to pursue and kill a were-wolf or\r\nloup-garou, which infested that province; “notwithstanding the existing\r\nlaws concerning the chase,” the people were empowered to “assemble with\r\njavelins, halberds, pikes, arquebuses and clubs to hunt and pursue the\r\nsaid were-wolf in all places, where they could find it, and to take, bind\r\nand kill it, without incurring any fine or other penalty.” The hunt seems\r\nto have been successful, if we may judge from the fact that the same\r\ntribunal in the following year (1574) condemned to be burned a man named\r\nGilles Garnier, who ran on all fours in the forest and fields and devoured\r\nlittle children “even on Friday.” The poor lycanthrope, it appears, had as\r\nslight respect for ecclesiastical fasts as the French pig already\r\nmentioned, which was not restrained by any feeling of piety from eating\r\ninfants on a _jour maigre_.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. of England summoned Thomas à Becket to appear before the Star\r\nChamber to answer for his crimes and then had him condemned as a traitor,\r\nand his bones, that had been nearly four centuries in the tomb and\r\nworshipped as holy relics by countless pilgrims, burned and scattered to\r\nthe winds.\r\n\r\nWhen Stephen VI. succeeded to the tiara in 896, one of his first acts was\r\nto cause the body of his predecessor, Formosus, to be exhumed and brought\r\nto trial on the charge of having unlawfully and sacrilegiously usurped\r\nthe papal dignity. A writ of summons was issued in due form and the corpse\r\nof the octogenarian pope, which had lain already eight months in the\r\ngrave, was dug up, re-arrayed in full pontificals and seated on a throne\r\nin the council-hall of St. Peter’s, where a synod had been convened to\r\nadjudicate upon the case. No legal formality was omitted in this strange\r\nprocedure and a deacon was appointed to defend the accused, although the\r\nsynodical jury was known to be packed and the verdict predetermined.\r\nFormosus was found guilty and condemned to deposition. No sooner was the\r\nsentence pronounced than the executioners thrust him from the throne,\r\nstripped him of his pontifical robes and other ensigns of office, cut off\r\nthe three benedictory fingers of his right hand, dragged him by the feet\r\nout of the judgment-hall and threw his body “as a pestilential thing”\r\n(_uti quoddam mephiticum_) into the Tiber. Not until several months later,\r\nafter Stephen himself had been strangled in prison, were the mutilated and\r\nputrefied remains of Formosus taken out of the water and restored to the\r\ntomb. The Athenian Prytaneum, as we have already seen, was guilty of the\r\nchildishness of prosecuting inanimate objects, but it never violated the\r\nsepulchre for the purpose of inflicting post-humous punishment on corpses.\r\nThe perpetration of this brutality was reserved for the Papal See.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of ancient and mediæval jurisprudents the overt act\r\nalone was assumed to constitute the crime; the mental condition of the\r\ncriminal was never or at least very seldom taken into consideration. It is\r\nremarkable how long this crude and superficial conception of justice\r\nprevailed, and how very recently even the first attempts have been made to\r\nestablish penal codes on a philosophic basis. The punishableness of an\r\noffence is now generally recognized as depending solely upon the sanity\r\nand rationality of the offender. Crime, morally and legally considered,\r\npresupposes, not perfect, for such a thing does not exist, but normal\r\nfreedom of the will on the part of the agent. Where this element is\r\nwanting, there is no culpability, whatever may have been the consequences\r\nof the act. Modern criminal law looks primarily to the psychical origin of\r\nthe deed, and only secondarily to its physical effects; mediæval criminal\r\nlaw ignored the origin altogether, and regarded exclusively the effects,\r\nwhich it dealt with on the homœopenal principle of _similia similibus\r\npuniantur_, for the most part blindly and brutally applied.\r\n\r\nMancini, Lombroso, Garofalo, Albrecht, Benedikt, Büchner, Moleschott,\r\nDespine, Fouillée, Letourneau, Maudsley, Bruce Thompson, Nicholson,\r\nMinzloff, Notovich and other European criminal lawyers, physiologists and\r\nanthropologists have devoted themselves with peculiar zeal and rare\r\nacuteness to the study and solution of obscure and perplexing problems of\r\npsycho-pathological jurisprudence, and have drawn nice and often overnice\r\ndistinctions in determining degrees of personal responsibility. Judicial\r\nprocedure no longer stops with testimony establishing the bald facts in\r\nthe case, but admits also the evidence of the expert alienist in order to\r\nascertain to what extent the will of the accused was free or functionally\r\nnormal in its operation. Here it is not a question of raving madness or of\r\ndrivelling idiocy, perceptible to the coarsest understanding and the\r\ncrassest ignorance; but the slightest morbid disturbance, impairing the\r\nfull and healthy exercise of the mental faculties, must be examined and\r\nestimated. If “privation of mind” and “irresistible force,” says Zupetta,\r\nare exculpatory, then “partial vitiation of mind” and “semi-irresistible\r\nforce” are entitled to the same or at least to proportional consideration.\r\nThere are states of being which are mutually contradictory and exclusive\r\nand cannot co-exist, such as life and death. A partial state of life or\r\ndeath is impossible; such expressions as half-alive and half-dead are\r\nhyperbolical figures of speech used for purely rhetorical purposes; taken\r\nliterally, they are simply absurd. It is not so, however, with states of\r\nmind. The intellect, whose soundness is the first condition of\r\naccountability, may be perfectly clear, manifesting itself in all its\r\nfulness and power, or it may be partially obscured. So, too, the will,\r\nwhose self-determination is the second condition of accountability, may\r\nassert itself with complete freedom and untrammelled force, or it may act\r\nunder stress and with imperfect volition. Moral coercion, whether arising\r\nfrom external influences, abnormities of the physical organism or defects\r\nof the mental constitution, is not less real because it is not easy to\r\ndetect and may not be wholly irresistible. For this reason, it involves no\r\ncontradiction in terms and is not absurd to call an action half-conscious,\r\nhalf-voluntary, or half-constrained. “Partial vitiation of mind” is a\r\nstate distinctly recognized in psychiatrical science. In like manner,\r\nthere is no essential incongruity in affirming that an impulse may be the\r\nresult of a “semi-irresistible force.” But these mental conditions and\r\nforces do not manifest themselves with equal obviousness and intensity in\r\nall cases; sometimes they are scarcely appreciable; again they verge upon\r\n“absolute privation of mind” and “wholly irresistible force;” and it is\r\nthe duty of the judge to adjust the penalty to the gradations of guilt as\r\ndetermined by the greater or less freedom of the agent.\r\n\r\nThe same process of reasoning would lead to the admission of\r\nquasi-vitiations of mind and quasi-irresistible forces as grounds of\r\nexculpation. Thus one might go on analyzing and refining away human\r\nresponsibility, and reducing all crime to resultants of mental\r\nderangement, until every malefactor would come to be looked upon, not as a\r\nculprit to be delivered over to the sharp stroke of the headsman or the\r\nsafe custody of the jailer, but as an unfortunate victim of morbid states\r\nand uncontrollable impulses, to be consigned to the sympathetic care of\r\nthe psychiater.\r\n\r\nItalian anthropologists and jurisprudents have been foremost and gone\r\nfarthest, both theoretically and practically, in this reaction from\r\nmediæval conceptions of crime and its proper punishment. This violent\r\nrecoil from extreme cruelty to excessive commiseration is due, in a great\r\nmeasure, to the Italian temperament, to a peculiar gentleness and\r\nimpressionableness of character, which, combined with an instinctive\r\naversion to whatever shocks the senses and mars the pleasure of the\r\nmoment, are apt to degenerate into shallow sentimentality and sickly\r\nsensibility, thereby enfeebling and perverting the moral sense and\r\ndistorting all ideas of right and justice. To minds thus constituted the\r\ncool and deliberate condemnation of a human being to the gallows is an\r\natrocity, in comparison with which a fatal stab in the heat of passion or\r\nunder strong provocation seems a light and venial transgression. This\r\nmaudlin sympathy with the guilty living man, who is in danger of suffering\r\nfor his crime, to the entire forgetfulness of the innocent dead man, the\r\nvictim of his anger or cupidity, pervades all classes of society, and has\r\nstimulated the ingenuity of lawyers and legislators to discover mitigating\r\nmoments and extenuating circumstances and other means of loosening and\r\nenlarging the intricate meshes of the penal code so as to permit the\r\nculprit to escape. To this end they eagerly seized upon the doctrine of\r\nevolution and endeavoured to seek the origin of crime in hereditary\r\npropensities, atavistic recurrences, physical degeneracies and other\r\norganic fatalities, for which no one can be held personally responsible,\r\nand constructed upon the basis of the most recent scientific researches a\r\npenological system giving free scope and full gratification to this\r\npitying and palliating disposition.\r\n\r\nBut, although the Italians have been pioneers in this movement, it has not\r\nbeen confined to them; it extends to all civilized nations, and expresses\r\na general tendency of the age. Even the Germans, those leaders in theory\r\nand laggards in practice, whose studies and speculations have illustrated\r\nall forms and phases of judicial procedure, but who adhere so\r\nconservatively to ancient methods and resist so stubbornly the tides of\r\nreform in their own courts have yielded on this point. They no longer\r\nregard insanity and idiocy as the only grounds of exemption from\r\npunishment, but include in the same category “all morbid disturbances of\r\nmental activity,” and “all states of mind in which the free determination\r\nof the will is not indeed wholly destroyed, but only partially impaired.”\r\nIn order to realize the radical changes that have taken place in this\r\ndirection within a relatively recent period, it will suffice merely to\r\ncompare the present criminal code of the German Empire with the Austrian\r\ncode of 1803, the Bavarian code of 1813, and the Prussian code of 1851. It\r\nmust be remembered, too, that these changes have been effected under the\r\ndrift of public opinion in spite of the political preponderance of Prussia\r\nand her strong bureaucratic influence, which has always been exerted in\r\nfavour of severe penalties, and shown slight consideration for individual\r\nfrailties and criminal idiosyncrasies in inflicting punishment. As the\r\nstronghold of a stolid and supercilious squirearchy (Junkerthum) in\r\nGermany, Prussia has stubbornly resisted to the last every reformatory\r\nmovement in civil and social, and especially in criminal legislation.\r\n\r\nA recent decision of the supreme court of the German Empire (pronounced in\r\nthe summer of 1894) seems to put a check upon this tendency by rejecting\r\nthe plea of “moral insanity” in the extenuation of crime. As a matter of\r\nfact, however, the question whether such a state of mind as “moral\r\ninsanity” exists or can exist has not yet been settled; and so long as\r\npsychiaters do not agree as to the actuality or possibility of this\r\nanomalous mental condition, courts of justice may very properly refuse to\r\ntake it into consideration or to allow it to exert the slightest influence\r\nupon their judgment in the infliction of judicial punishment. Moral\r\ninsanity, as usually defined, involves a disturbance of the moral\r\nperceptions and a derangement of the emotional nature, without impairing\r\nthe distinctively intellectual faculties. The supposed victim of this\r\nhypothetical form of madness is capable of thinking logically and often\r\nshows remarkable astuteness in forming his plans and executing his\r\ncriminal purposes, but seems utterly destitute of the moral sense and of\r\nall the finer feelings of humanity, performing the most atrocious deeds\r\nwithout hesitation and remembering them without the slightest compunction.\r\nIn moral stolidity and the lack of susceptibility he is on a level with\r\nthe lowest savage. German psychiaters, on the whole, are inclined to\r\nregard such persons, not as morally insane, but as morally degenerate and\r\ndepraved; and German jurists and judges are not disposed to admit such\r\nvitiation of character as an extenuating circumstance, especially at a\r\ntime when criminals of this class are on the increase and are banded\r\ntogether to overthrow civilized society and to introduce an era of anarchy\r\nand barbarism. The decision of the German judicatory is therefore not\r\nreactionary, but merely precautionary, and simply indicates a wise\r\ndetermination to keep the administration of criminal law unencumbered by\r\ntheories, which science has not yet fully established and which at present\r\ncan only serve to paralyze the arm of retributive justice.\r\n\r\nMediæval penal justice sought to inflict the greatest possible amount of\r\nsuffering on the offender and showed a diabolical fertility of invention\r\nin devising new methods of torture even for the pettiest trespasses. The\r\nmonuments of this barbarity may now be seen in European museums in the\r\nform of racks, thumbkins, interlarded hares, Pomeranian bonnets, Spanish\r\nboots, scavenger’s daughters, iron virgins and similar engines of cruelty.\r\nUntil quite recently an iron virgin, with its interior full of long and\r\nsharp spikes, was exhibited in a subterranean passage at Nuremberg, on the\r\nvery spot where it is supposed to have once performed its horrible\r\nfunctions; and in Munich this inhuman instrument of punishment was in\r\nactual use as late as the beginning of the nineteenth century. The\r\ncriminal code of Maria Theresa, published in 1769, contained forty-five\r\nlarge copperplate engravings, illustrating the various modes of torture\r\nprescribed in the text for the purpose of extorting confession and\r\nevidently designed to serve as object lessons for the instruction of the\r\ntormentor and the intimidation of the accused. That Prussia was the first\r\ncountry in Germany to abolish judicial torture was due, not to the\r\nprogressive spirit of the nation or of its tribunals, but solely to the\r\nsuperior enlightenment and energy of Frederic the Great, who effected this\r\nreform arbitrarily and against the will of jurists and judges by\r\ncabinet-orders issued in 1740 and 1745. Crimes which women are under\r\npeculiar temptation to commit, were punished with extraordinary severity.\r\nThus the infanticide was buried alive, a small tube communicating with the\r\nouter air being placed in her mouth in order to prolong her life and her\r\nagony. A case of this kind is recorded in the proceedings of the\r\n“Malefiz-Gericht” or criminal court of Ensisheim in Alsatia under the date\r\nof February 3, 1570. In 1401, an apprentice, who stole from his master\r\nfive pfennigs (then as now the smallest coin of Germany and worth about\r\nthe fifth of a cent), was condemned to have both his ears cut off.\r\nIncredible barbarities of this kind were practised by some of the best and\r\nnoblest men of that age. Thus Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, who was pre-eminent\r\namong his contemporaries for the purity of his life and the benevolence of\r\nhis character, did not hesitate to condemn Fra Tommaso di Mileto, a\r\nFranciscan monk, to be walled up alive, because he entertained heretical\r\nnotions concerning the sinfulness of eating meat on Friday, and expressed\r\ndoubts touching the worship of images, indulgences, the supreme and\r\ninfallible authority of the pope, and the real presence in the eucharist.\r\nThis cruel sentence, a striking illustration of the words of Lucretius,\r\n\r\n  “Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum,”\r\n\r\nwas pronounced December 16, 1564, as follows: “I condemn you to be walled\r\nup in a place enclosed by four walls, where, with anguish of heart and\r\nabundance of tears, you shall bewail your sins and grievous offences\r\ncommitted against the majesty of God, and the holy mother Church and the\r\nreligion of St. Francis, the founder of your order.” A bishop, who should\r\nimpose such a punishment now-a-days, would be very properly declared\r\ninsane and divested of his office.\r\n\r\nMuch ridicule has been cast upon the so-called “Blue Laws” of Connecticut\r\non account of the narrowness and pettiness of their prevailing spirit.\r\nFrom our present point of view they are absurd and in many respects\r\natrocious, but compared with the penal codes of that time they mark a\r\ngreat advance in human legislation. They reduced the number of crimes,\r\nthen punishable in England by death, from two hundred and twenty-three to\r\nfourteen. In the mother-country, as late as the seventeenth century,\r\ncounterfeiters and issuers of false coin were condemned to be boiled to\r\ndeath in oil by slow degrees. The culprit was suspended over the cauldron\r\nand gradually let down into it, first boiling the feet, then the legs and\r\nso on, until all the flesh was separated from the bones and the body\r\nreduced to a skeleton. The Puritans of New England, relentless as they\r\nwere in their dealings with sectaries, were never so ruthless as this; nor\r\nis it probable that they would have inflicted capital punishment upon\r\ntheir own “stubborn and rebellious sons,” or upon persons who “worship\r\nany other God but the Lord God,” had it not been for precedents recorded\r\nin laws enacted by a semi-civilized people thousands of years ago and\r\nsupposed to have been dictated by divine wisdom. They failed to perceive\r\nthe incongruity of attempting to rear a democratic commonwealth on\r\ntheocratic foundations and made the fatal mistake of planning their\r\nstructure after what they regarded as the perfect model of the Jewish\r\nZion.\r\n\r\nIf we compare these barbarities with the law recently enacted by the\r\nlegislature of the state of New York, whereby capital punishment is to be\r\ninflicted as quickly and painlessly as possible by means of electricity,\r\nwe shall be able to appreciate the immense difference between the mediæval\r\nand the modern spirit in the conception and execution of penal justice.\r\n\r\nA point of practical importance, which the criminal anthropologist has to\r\nconsider is the relation of moral to penal responsibility. If there is no\r\nfreedom of the will and the commission of crime is the necessary result of\r\nphysiological idiosyncrasies, hereditary predispositions, brachycephalous,\r\ndolichocephalous or microcephalous peculiarities, anomalies of cerebral\r\nconvolution, or other anatomical asymmetries, over which the individual\r\nhas no control and by which his destiny is determined, then he is\r\ncertainly not morally responsible for his conduct. But is he on this\r\naccount to be exempt from punishment? The vast majority of criminalists\r\nanswer this question unhesitatingly in the negative, declaring that penal\r\nlegislation is independent of metaphysical opinion, and that punishment is\r\nproper and imperative so far as it is essential to the protection and\r\npreservation of society. If the infliction of the penalties depriving a\r\nman of his freedom or his life is found to secure these ends, it is the\r\nduty of the tribunals established for the administration of justice to\r\nimpose them without troubling themselves about the mental condition of the\r\nculprit or stopping to discuss problems which belong to the province of\r\nthe psychiater. Legal tribunals are not offices in which candidates for\r\nthe insane asylum are examined or certificates of admission to\r\nreformatories issued, but are organized as a terror to evil-doers in the\r\ngeneral interests of society, and all their decisions should have this\r\nobject in view. If a madman is not hanged for murder, it is solely because\r\nsuch a procedure would exert no deterring influence upon other madmen;\r\nsociety protects itself, in cases of this kind, by depriving the dangerous\r\nindividual of his liberty and thus preventing him from doing harm; but it\r\nhas no right to inflict upon him wanton and superfluous suffering. Even if\r\nit should be deemed desirable to kill him, the method of his removal\r\nshould be such as to cause the least possible pain and publicity. Here,\r\ntoo, the welfare of society is the determinative factor.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine reduces confirmed criminals to the condition of ferocious\r\nbeasts and venomous reptiles, and logically demands that they should be\r\neliminated for precisely the same reason that noxious animals are\r\nexterminated, although neither the human nor the animal creatures are to\r\nblame for the perniciousness of their inborn proclivities and natural\r\ninstincts. In the eyes of Courcelle-Seneuil a prison is a “kind of\r\nmenagerie”; Naquet, the French chemist and senator, goes still farther,\r\ndeclaring that men are no more culpable for being criminal than vitriol is\r\nfor being corrosive, and adding that it is our own fault if we put this\r\nstuff into our tea and are poisoned by it. The same writer maintains that\r\n“there is no more demerit in being perverse than in being cross-eyed or\r\nhump-backed.” In a recent lecture on criminal jurisprudence and biology\r\nProfessor Benedikt cites the case of a Moravian robber and murderer, whose\r\nbrain was found on dissection to resemble that of a beast of prey and who\r\nwas therefore, in the opinion of the eminent Viennese authority, no more\r\nresponsible for his bloody deeds than is a lion or a tiger for its\r\nravages. The corollary to this anatomical demonstration is that one should\r\ntreat such a man as a lion or a tiger and shoot him on the spot. Atavistic\r\nrelapses, defective cerebral development and other abnormities\r\nundoubtedly occur in criminals, whose acts may be traced, in some degree,\r\nto these physical imperfections and therefore be pathologically stimulated\r\nand partially necessitated by them. On the other hand, there are thousands\r\nof persons with equally small and unsymmetrical craniums, who do not\r\ncommit crime, but remain respectable, safe, and useful members of society.\r\n\r\nLombroso discovers in habitual malefactors a tendency to tattoo their\r\nbodies; but this kind of cuticular ornamentation indicates merely a low\r\ndevelopment of the æsthetic sense, a barbarous conception of the beautiful\r\nor what would be called bad taste, and has not the slightest genetic or\r\nsymptomatic connection with crime and the proclivity to perpetrate it. As\r\na means of embellishing the exterior man it may be rude and unrefined, but\r\nafter all it is only skin-deep, and does not extend to the moral\r\ncharacter. Honest people of the lower classes take pleasure in disfiguring\r\nthemselves in this way, and soldiers and sailors, who are very far from\r\nfurnishing the largest percentage of criminals, are especially addicted to\r\nit, simply because they find ample leisure in the barracks and the\r\nforecastle to undergo this slow and painful process of what they deem\r\nadornment. According to Lombroso criminals have as a rule thick heads of\r\nhair and thin beards; but as the majority of them are comparatively young,\r\nthese phenomena are by no means remarkable. He has also found that the\r\nhair of such persons is usually black or dark chestnut; had his\r\ninvestigations been carried on in Norway and Sweden instead of in Italy,\r\nhe would have certainly come to the conclusion that flaxen hair is an\r\nindex of a criminal character.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to deny the existence of a constitutionally criminal\r\nclass, a persistently perverse element, which is the born foe of all law\r\nand order, at war with every form of social and political organization and\r\nwhose permanent attitude of mind is that of the Irishman, who, on landing\r\nin New York, inquired: “Have ye a government here?” and, on receiving an\r\naffirmative answer, replied, “Then I’m agin’ it.” Criminal anthropologists\r\nhave been especially earnest in their endeavours to define this pernicious\r\ntype and to determine the physiological and physiognomical features, which\r\ncharacterize and constitute it. This line of research is unquestionably in\r\nthe right direction, but as a reaction against barren scholastic\r\nspeculations and brutal penal codes has been carried to excess by\r\nenthusiastic specialists and led to broad generalizations and hasty\r\ndeductions from insufficient data. Taine’s definition of man as “an animal\r\nof a higher species, that produces poems and systems of philosophy, as\r\nsilkworms spin cocoons and bees secrete honeycomb,” applies with equal\r\nforce to the vicious side of human nature. Criminal propensities, as well\r\nas creative powers, are the resultants of race, temperament, climate,\r\nfood, organism, environment and other pre-natal and post-natal influences\r\nand agencies, to which the individual did not voluntarily subject himself\r\nand from which he cannot escape. The acts, therefore, which he performs,\r\nwhether good or evil, are as independent of his will as the colour of his\r\nhair or the shape of his nose; for while they are apparently volitional\r\nimpulses, the will itself, from which they seem to proceed, is determined\r\nby forces as fixed and free from his control as are those which render him\r\nblue-eyed or snub-nosed.\r\n\r\nThe penological application of this philosophical principle has given rise\r\nto numerous theories concerning the nature and origin of crime. Lombroso\r\nand his disciples, as we have already intimated, attribute it to atavism\r\nor the survival in the individual of the animal instincts and low morals\r\nof the aboriginal barbarian. The criminal is simply a savage let loose in\r\na civilized community and ignoring the ethical conceptions developed by\r\nages of culture and performing actions that would have seemed perfectly\r\nproper and praiseworthy in the eyes of our pre-historic ancestors. The\r\nhero of the Palæolithic age is the brigand and cut-throat of to-day. The\r\ncriminal type is nothing but a reversion to the primitive type of the\r\nrace, and the representatives of this school of anthropologists have been\r\nuntiring in their efforts to discover physical and moral characteristics\r\ncommon to both: long arms like chimpanzees, four circumvolutions of the\r\nfrontal lobes of the brain like the large carnivora, small cranial\r\ncapacity like the cave-men, canine teeth like anthropoid apes and a simian\r\nnose. This analogy extends to the eyes, the ears, the hair, and even to\r\nthe internal organs, the liver, the heart and the stomach, and the\r\ndiseases by which they are affected. It has also been observed that\r\nassassins are brachycephalous and thieves dolichocephalous. Marro\r\nmaintains that in many cases metaphors express real facts and embody the\r\ncommon conclusions of mankind based upon centuries of observation:\r\nswindlers have a foxy look, long-fingered persons are naturally thievish,\r\nwhereas a club-fisted fellow is pretty sure to have a pugnacious\r\ndisposition, and to be a born rough. Nevertheless social surroundings,\r\neducational influences and other outward circumstances are important\r\nfactors, not so much in changing the character as in giving it direction;\r\nthe same cerebral constitution and consequent innate predisposition may\r\nmake a man a hero or a bravo, a dashing soldier like Phil Sheridan, or a\r\ndaring robber like Fra Diavolo, according to the place of his birth and\r\nthe nature of his environment.\r\n\r\nIn common discourse we speak of atrabiliary, spleeny, choleric, or even\r\nstomachous persons, but such expressions are, in most cases, survivals of\r\nantiquated beliefs concerning the functions of certain physical organs.\r\nHypochondria has no more originary connection with the cartilage of the\r\nbreastbone than with the cartilage of the ear. In the literal sense of the\r\nterms a large-brained man is not necessarily of superior intellectual\r\npower any more than a large-hearted man is naturally generous or a\r\nlarge-handed man instinctively grasping. So, too, the theory that\r\nintelligence and morality are in direct proportion to the size and\r\nsymmetry of the encephalon is not sustained by facts; at least the\r\nexceptions to the rule are so many and so remarkable as to render it\r\nextremely misleading and therefore of little practical value as a\r\nscientific principle. Gambetta’s brain, for example, weighed only 1294\r\ngrammes, being fifty-eight grammes less in weight than that of the average\r\nParisian, and was so abnormally irregular in its configuration as to seem\r\nactually deformed. Any physiologist, says Dr. Manouvrier, who should come\r\nacross such a skull in a museum, would unhesitatingly pronounce it to be\r\nthat of a savage. The third frontal circumvolution of the left lobe of his\r\nbrain had in the posterior part a supplementary fold said by some to be\r\nthe organ of speech and by others to be the organ of theft; perhaps both\r\ncombined in the ability of the orator to steal away men’s hearts, as\r\nAntony says of the seductive eloquence of Brutus. The distinguished\r\nphysiologist Bichat was an ardent advocate of this doctrine of the causal\r\nconnection between cranial capacity and symmetry and vigorous and\r\nwell-balanced mental faculties, but after his death his own cranium was\r\nfound to be conspicuously lacking in the very characteristics which he\r\ndeemed so essential to man as a moral and intellectual being. The late\r\nGerman professor Bischoff based his argument against the higher education\r\nof woman on the fact that the average female brain weighs only 1272\r\ngrammes, and asserted that a person with such a light encephalon must be\r\norganically incompetent to master the various branches of study taught in\r\nour universities. A post-mortem examination proved his own brain to be\r\nconsiderably inferior in weight to that of the average woman.\r\n\r\nCareful investigations would doubtless furnish additional examples of this\r\ncomical application of the _argumentum ad hominem_ in refutation of the\r\nnotion that intellectual capacity is determined by the bulk of the brain\r\nor the shape of the skull. Ugo Foscolo, one of the most celebrated of\r\nmodern Italian poets, had a cranium, which, according to this standard of\r\nappreciation, ought to have belonged to an idiot. On the other hand, the\r\nbrain of the “Hottentot Venus,” examined by Gratiolet, far surpassed in\r\nthe symmetry of both hemispheres and the perfection of its circumvolutions\r\nthe normal brains of the Caucasian race. The same phenomenon has been\r\nobserved, although in a less striking manner, occasionally in cretins and\r\nquite often in criminals. Character is the resultant of a multitude of\r\ncombined forces, the great majority of which are still unknown and perhaps\r\nunknowable quantities. The impulse given by each must be exactly estimated\r\nin order to predetermine the joint effect. No factor which contributes to\r\nits formation must be overlooked, and the acceptance of any one of them,\r\nhowever important it may seem to be, as the basis on which to reform and\r\nreconstruct our penal legislation, would be premature and pernicious. This\r\nhobby-horsical tendency, which is the vice of every specialist, is now the\r\nbesetting sin of criminal anthropologists, each of whom is firmly\r\nconvinced that he can reach the goal only on his own garran.\r\n\r\n“The more advanced criminalists,” says Professor Von Kirchenheim, “are\r\nbecoming thoroughly convinced that the penal codes of to-day do not\r\ncorrespond to the criminal world of to-day. No science has remained so\r\ndeeply rooted and grounded in scholasticism as jurisprudence; and this\r\nevil is most clearly perceptible in the province of criminal law. The\r\nnecessity of a change in our penal legislation has already made itself\r\nwidely felt. The contest with crime must now be carried on in a different\r\nmanner from what it was when men waged war with bows and arrows; modern\r\ncriminality must be fought, as it were, with repeating rifles.” In other\r\nwords, we can never suppress crime by meeting it with bludgeons and\r\nboomerangs and other rude implements of barbarous warfare, but must\r\nencounter it with the finest and most effective weapons of precision,\r\nwhich the armoury of modern science can put into our hands. Society has\r\noutgrown the crude conception of punishment as mere retaliation or\r\nretribution incited by revenge. There is no doubt that even in the most\r\nenlightened countries, penology as a science is still in its infancy, and\r\nis only just beginning to feel the uncomfortable girding of its scanty\r\nswaddling-bands and blindly kicking itself free from them. That this first\r\nemancipatory effort should be somewhat clumsy, and occasionally attended\r\nby comical casualties and even serious disasters, lies in the very nature\r\nof the case. It is evident, too, that the antiquated and utterly\r\nirrational methods now employed for the suppression of crime tend directly\r\nto increase it. It is the aim of the positive, in distinction from the\r\nclassical school of criminalists to discover the real causes of criminal\r\nactions, and thus to endeavour to eradicate or neutralize them. A casual\r\ncriminal, for example, whom external conditions, accidental circumstances,\r\nsudden temptations or bad influences have led astray, should not be\r\ntreated in the same manner, although guilty of the same overt act, as the\r\nhabitual or constitutional criminal, whose wrong-doing arises from a\r\ndiseased, ill-balanced or undeveloped mental or physical organization, and\r\nis therefore an inborn and perhaps irresistible proclivity. The latter is\r\nhardly responsible for his conduct, and the possibility of reforming him\r\nis slight. The only proper thing to do with such a culprit is to render\r\nhim personally harmless to society either by death or perpetual\r\nincarceration, and to prevent him from propagating his kind. The law of\r\nthe survival of the fittest through selection suggests as its necessary\r\nsequence the suppression of the unfittest through sterilization. Nature\r\nhas her own effective and relentless method of attaining this desirable\r\nresult; but man is constantly thwarting her beneficent purposes by all\r\nsorts of pernicious schemes originating in factitious sentimentalism and\r\nmaudlin sympathy, which under the plea of philanthropy tend to foster and\r\nperpetuate moral monstrosities to the discomfort and detriment of\r\ncivilized society and the permanent deterioration of the race. To sentence\r\npersons of this class to eight or ten years’ imprisonment and then to turn\r\nthem loose again as a constant source of peril to mankind, is the greatest\r\nfolly that any tribunal can possibly commit. It is a wrong done both to\r\nthe criminal and to the community of which he is a member. The penalties\r\nimposed by the law should be determined not solely by the enormity of the\r\ncrime, but chiefly by the character of the criminal. Paradoxical as such\r\na conclusion may be, it is nevertheless a strictly logical deduction from\r\nthe premises, that the more corrupt he is by his physical constitution and\r\ntherefore the less culpable he is from a moral point of view, the more\r\nsevere should be the sentence pronounced upon him. Where the vicious\r\npropensity is in the blood and beyond the reach of moral or penal\r\npurgations, the only safety is in the elimination of the individual, just\r\nas the only remedy for a gangrened limb is amputation. We ridicule ancient\r\nand mediæval courts of justice for prosecuting bugs and beasts, but future\r\ngenerations will condemn as equally absurd and outrageous our judicial\r\ntreatment of human beings, who can no more help perpetrating deeds of\r\nviolence, under given conditions, than locusts and caterpillars can help\r\nconsuming crops to the injury of the husbandman, or wild beasts can help\r\nrending and devouring their prey. It is also interesting to know that in\r\nformer times the animal was not punished capitally because it was supposed\r\nto have incurred guilt, but as a memorial of the occurrence, or in the\r\nlanguage of canonical law: _Non propter culpam sed propter memoriam facti\r\npecus occiditur_. It was put to death not because it was culpable, but\r\nbecause it was harmful; and this is the ground on which the radical wing\r\nof criminal anthropologists would repress and eliminate a vicious person\r\nwithout regard to his mental soundness or moral responsibility; to use\r\nGarofalo’s metaphor he is a microbe injurious to the social organism and\r\nmust be destroyed.\r\n\r\nLombroso carries his theory of the innateness, hereditability and\r\nineradicableness of criminal propensities so far as to affirm that\r\n“education cannot change those who are born with perverse instincts,” and\r\nto despair of correcting an obstinate bias of this sort even in a child.\r\nIn accordance with this idea his disciple, Le Bon, proposes to “deport to\r\ndistant countries all professional criminals or persistent relapsers into\r\nvice (_récidivistes_) together with their posterity,” and would thus\r\npractically revive the barbarous principle of visiting the sins of the\r\nfathers upon the children, although he does not regard their conduct as\r\nsinful in the sense of being a voluntary transgression of the moral law,\r\nbut as the result of a transmitted taint and organic deficiency, for which\r\nthe individual is in no wise responsible. It is hardly necessary to add\r\nthat this doctrine is not sustained by the statistics of reformatories,\r\nhouses of refuge and similar institutions, which have now taken the place\r\nof the prison and the scaffold in the case of juvenile offenders.\r\n\r\nThose who look upon crime as a pathological phenomenon find a striking\r\nillustration and strong confirmation of their views in violations of the\r\nlaw committed under the impulse of hypnotic suggestion. Some maintain that\r\nall acts originating in this manner are purely automatic, and acquit the\r\nperson performing them of all moral and legal responsibility, since they\r\nexpress the will and purpose of the hypnotizer, who alone should be held\r\naccountable. Others hold that the man, who consents to be hypnotized and\r\nthus voluntarily surrenders his will-power and permits himself to be used\r\nas an instrument for the perpetration of crime, should be punished for his\r\noffences and not allowed to go scot-free by pleading the _force majeure_\r\nof hypnotic suggestion. The liability to punishment, it is justly argued,\r\nwould be a safeguard to society by putting a wholesome and effective check\r\non hypnotic experimentations. There is at least no reason why the\r\nhypnotized subject should not be called to account for accomplicity. Any\r\npassion may become automatic and irresistible by long indulgence and\r\nassiduous cultivation, so that the man is overmastered by it and cannot\r\nhelp yielding to it under strong temptation; but the victim of a vicious\r\nhabit has no right to urge the force of an evil propensity in exculpation\r\nof himself. The inborn or inveterate badness of a man’s character may\r\nexplain, but cannot excuse his bad conduct in the impartial and inexorable\r\neye of justice. So, too, he who sins against his own worthiness and\r\ndignity as a rational being by choosing to annul his power of\r\nself-determination as a voluntary agent and become a helpless tool in the\r\nhands of another, ought not wholly to escape the consequences of his\r\nfolly. That the hypnotizer should be made fully responsible for the\r\nrealization of his suggestions, no representative of either the positive\r\nor classical school of criminalists would probably deny. To take a man’s\r\nlife by means of hypnotic suggestion is as truly subornation to murder as\r\nto hire an assassin to plunge a dagger into his heart.\r\n\r\nAs regards hypnotism itself, it would be strange enough if we should\r\ndiscover in it the real scientific basis of witchcraft, and modern\r\nlegislation should prosecute and punish hypnotizers as mediæval\r\nlegislation prosecuted and punished sorcerers. The sympathetic influence\r\nof a morbidly imaginative mind upon the body in directing the currents of\r\nnervous energy and increasing the flow of blood towards particular points\r\nof the physical organism, so as to produce stigmata and similar abnormal\r\nphenomena, has long been recognized as an adequate explanation of much\r\nmediæval and modern miracle-mongering. It would now seem as if hypnotism,\r\nor the magnetic influence of one man’s will upon another man’s mind and\r\nbody were destined to furnish the key to still greater marvels and reveal\r\nthe true nature and origin of what has hitherto passed for divine\r\ninspiration or diabolical possession. Charcot, Renaut, Fowler and other\r\neminent neuropathologists have conclusively shown that certain forms of\r\nhysteria sometimes produce tumors, ulcers, muscular atrophy, paralysis of\r\nthe limbs and like affections apparently organic, but really nervous. In\r\nsuch cases any kind of faith-cure, in which the patient has confidence,\r\nprayer, the laying on of hands, the water of Lourdes or of St. Ignatius,\r\nmedals of St. Benedict, scapularies of the Virgin, seraphic girdles, a\r\npilgrimage to the shrine of a saint or contact with a holy relic may prove\r\nfar more efficacious than drugs and are therefore recommended by priests\r\nand occasionally even prescribed by physicians, who are far too\r\nenlightened to regard such healings as miraculous or supernatural. The\r\nsuccess of scientific research in disclosing the physical basis of\r\nintellectual life is gradually undermining the foundations of so-called\r\nspiritualism, and rendering it more and more impossible to mistake\r\nsymptoms of chlorosis and hysterical weakness for spiritual gifts and\r\nsigns of God’s special favour. Sickly women are no longer treated as\r\nseeresses and their vague and incoherent sayings treasured as oracular\r\nutterances.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief difficulties encountered by those who seek to frame and\r\nadminister penal laws on psycho-pathological principles arises from the\r\nfact that no one has ever yet been able to give an exact and adequate\r\ndefinition of insanity. However easy it may be to recognize the grosser\r\nvarieties of mental disorder, it is often impossible even for an expert to\r\ndetect it in its subtler forms, or to draw a hard and fast line between\r\nsanity and insanity. An eminent alienist affirms that very few persons we\r\nmeet in the counting-room, on the street or in society, or with whom we\r\nenjoy pleasant intercourse at their firesides, are of perfectly sound\r\nmind. Nearly every one is a little touched; some molecule of the brain has\r\nturned into a maggot; there is some topic that cannot be introduced\r\nwithout making the portals of the mind grate on their golden hinges,--some\r\npoint at which we are forced to say,--\r\n\r\n  “O, that way madness lies; let me shun that.”\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that this very opinion may be a fixed idea or\r\nsymptomatic eccentricity of the alienist himself. The theory that all men\r\nare monomaniacs may be merely his peculiar monomania. Still there is\r\nunquestionably this much truth in it, that nearly every person has\r\ndeveloped some faculty at the expense of the others and thus destroyed his\r\nmental equilibrium. Every tendency of this kind, which is not checked or\r\nbalanced and in some way rounded off in the growth of the character,\r\nbecomes morbidly strong and leads to a sort of insanity. The specialist is\r\nalways exposed to this danger of growing into a man of one idea; his\r\nmonomania may be in the direction of valuable research or in the pursuit\r\nof a foolish whim, resulting in useful inventions or dissipating itself in\r\nchimerical projects; it may be a harmless crotchet or a vicious\r\nproclivity, philanthropic or misanthropic; it is, nevertheless, a bent or\r\nbias and so far a deviation from the norm of perfect intellectual\r\nrectitude.\r\n\r\nA madman, says Coleridge, is one who “mistakes his thoughts for person and\r\nthings.” But here the frenzies of the lunatic intrench on the functions of\r\nthe poet, who “of imagination all compact,” takes his fancies for\r\nrealities,\r\n\r\n  “Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\r\n    A local habitation and a name.”\r\n\r\nColeridge’s definition includes also the mythopœic faculty, the power of\r\nprojecting creations of the mind and endowing them with objective\r\nactuality and independent existence, which in the infancy of the race\r\npeopled heaven and earth with phantasms, and still croons over cradles and\r\nbabbles of brownie and fairy in nurseries and chimney-corners. No progress\r\nof science can wholly eradicate this tendency to mythologize. In the\r\nabsence of better material, it seizes upon the most prosaic and practical\r\nimprovements in modern household life and clothes them with poetry and\r\nlegend. The imaginative child of New York or Boston, after feeding the\r\nmind on fairy tales, converts the ordinary gas-pipe into the den of a\r\ndragon, which puts forth its fiery tongue when the knob is turned. The\r\nsleeping figure of a virgin carved in marble and copied from an ancient\r\nGreek sculpture of Ariadne, which reposes on an arch in the park of\r\nSans-souci at Potsdam, has been transformed by the popular imagination\r\ninto an enchanted princess, who will awake as soon as a horseman succeeds\r\nin springing over it three times with his steed. So vivid is the belief in\r\nthis story that many good Christians never pass through the archway\r\nwithout making the sign of the cross as a prophylactic against possible\r\ndemonic influences. The Suabian peasant still believes that the railroad\r\nis a device of the devil, who is entitled by contract to a tollage of one\r\npassenger on every train; he is in a constant state of anxiety lest his\r\nturn may come on the next trip and always wears a crucifix as the best\r\nmeans, so far as his own person is concerned, of cheating the devil of his\r\ndue. As the Church has uniformly consigned great inventors to the infernal\r\nregions, his Satanic Majesty could have never had any lack of ingenious\r\nwits among his subjects capable of advising him in such matters.\r\n\r\nAn important consideration, which did not disturb the minds of mediæval\r\njurists, nor stay the hand of strictly retributive justice, is the fact,\r\nnow generally admitted, that crimes, like all other human actions, are\r\nsubject to certain fixed laws, which seem to some extent to remove them\r\nfrom the province of free will and the power of individual determination.\r\nProfessor Morselli has shown statistically that suicide, which we are wont\r\nto consider a wholly voluntary act, is really dependent upon a great\r\nvariety of circumstances, over which man has no control: climate,\r\nseasons, months, days, state of crops, domestic, social, political,\r\nfinancial, economical, geographical and meteorological conditions, sun,\r\nmoon, and stars all work together, impelling him to self-destruction or\r\nkeeping him from it. Suicide increases when the earth is in aphelion, and\r\ndecreases when it is in perihelion. Race and religion are also important\r\nfactors in aggravating or mitigating the suicidal tendency, Germans and\r\nProtestants being most, and Semitic nations and Mohammedans, including\r\nthose of Aryan and African blood, being least addicted to it. Suicide is,\r\nin fact, the resultant of a vast number of complicated and far-reaching\r\nforces, which we can neither trace nor measure, and of which the victims\r\nthemselves are for the most part unconscious. To a very considerable\r\ndegree, it is a question of environment in the broadest sense of the term;\r\n“an effect,” says Morselli, “of the struggle for existence and of human\r\nselection, working according to the laws of evolution among civilized\r\npeoples.” What is proved to be true of self-slaughter is equally so of\r\nmurder and every other crime.\r\n\r\nAn additional reflection, that “must give us pause” in the presence of\r\ncrime, is that some of the chief causes operating to produce the manifold\r\nevils afflicting society and threatening to subvert it, are due in a great\r\nmeasure to the present egoistic organization of our social and industrial\r\nsystem, the selfish and unscrupulous power of wealth directed and\r\nstimulated by superior intelligence and energy, on the one hand, and the\r\nbrute forces of ignorance driven to despair by the disheartening and\r\ndebasing pressure of poverty, on the other hand, arrayed against each\r\nother in fierce and bitter conflict. Much of the individual viciousness,\r\nwhich society is required to punish, springs directly from the unjust and\r\ninjurious conditions of life, which society itself has created. It is the\r\nperception of this fact that disturbs the conscience, puzzles the will,\r\nand palsies the arm of the modern law-giver and executor of justice.\r\n\r\nMediæval legislators were not restrained by any scruples of this sort;\r\nthey regarded the criminal, both human and animal, as the sole author of\r\nthe crime, ascribing it simply to his own wickedness and never looking\r\nbeyond the mere actual deed to the social influences, psychical and\r\nphysical characteristics and inherited qualities, that impelled him with\r\nirresistible force to do iniquitous things. This was doubtless a very\r\nnarrow, superficial and utterly unphilosophical view of human action and\r\nresponsibility; the danger now-a-days lies in the opposite extreme, in the\r\ntendency to pity the vicious individual as the passive product and\r\ncommiserable victim of unfortunate conditions, and while engaged in the\r\nlaudable attempt to improve these conditions by working out broad and\r\nbenevolent plans of permanent relief and reformation for the future\r\namelioration of society, to relax penalties and to fail in providing by\r\nsufficiently stringent measures for its present security. Tribunals have\r\nonly to do with individual criminals as their conduct affects the general\r\nwelfare. In what manner their characters have been formed by ancestral\r\nagencies and other predispositions may be an interesting study to the\r\npsychologist and the sociologist, but does not concern the judge or the\r\njurist in the discharge of their official functions. The problem of crime\r\nis therefore a very simple one, so far as the criminal lawyer has to deal\r\nwith the concrete case, but very complex, when we look beyond the overt\r\nact to its genesis in the life of the race. The proper administration of\r\npenal justice is weakened and defeated by mixing itself up with\r\npsycho-pathological inquiries wholly foreign to it.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious coincidence that the theory of evolution, in its\r\napplication to man’s free agency, should arrive at essentially the same\r\nconclusion as the theology of Augustine and Calvin. Predestination, which\r\nthe suffragan of Hippo and the Genevan divine attributed to the arbitrary\r\ndecrees of God, evolution traces to the influences of heredity upon\r\nindividuals, predetermining their bodily and mental constitutions. There\r\nis, however, a wide difference between these two doctrines in their\r\nworkings. From the clutch of a deity “willing to show his wrath and to\r\nmake his power known,” no man can by any effort of his own effect his\r\nescape. Against this imperious and general sentence of damnation no\r\nprocess of development, no upward striving, no individual initiative can\r\nbe of any avail. Evolution, on the contrary, promises a gradual release\r\nfrom low ancestral conditions--the original sin of the theologians--and\r\nopens up to the race a way of redemption, not only through natural\r\nselection and spontaneous variations resulting in higher and nobler types\r\nof mankind, but also through the modification of inherited traits by\r\ncareful breeding, thorough discipline and the conscious and constant\r\nendeavour of every human being to improve and perfect himself. Salvation\r\nthrough the “election of grace” is by no means identical with salvation\r\nthrough the “survival of the fittest.” The righteousness of those whom God\r\nhas chosen as “the vessels of mercy whom he had afore prepared unto\r\nglory,” may be and probably is “as filthy rags”; evolutionary science, on\r\nthe contrary, recognizes and appreciates redeemable qualities by\r\nselecting, strengthening and propagating them and by this means aims\r\nultimately to redeem the world. It imposes upon each man the duty and\r\nnecessity of working out his own salvation, not with fear and trembling at\r\nthe prospect of meeting an angry deity, but with hope and cheerfulness,\r\nknowing that the beneficent forces of nature are working in him, as in\r\nall forms of organic life, in obedience to the laws of development,\r\ntowards the goal of his highest possible perfection by gradually\r\neliminating the heirloom of the beast and the savage, and letting the\r\ninstincts of the tiger and the ape slowly die within him. “The best man,”\r\nsaid Socrates, “is he who seeks most earnestly to perfect himself, and the\r\nhappiest man is he who has the fullest consciousness that he is perfecting\r\nhimself.” This utterance of the Athenian sage expresses the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the ethics of evolution, according to which there can be no\r\ngreater sin than the neglect of self-culture, holding, as it does, in the\r\nprovince of science a place corresponding in importance to that which the\r\nunpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost holds in the province of theology.\r\nNo one is blamable for inheriting bad tendencies; but every one is\r\nblamable for not striving to eradicate them. If evil impulses prove to be\r\nirresistible, then society must step in and render them harmless by\r\ndepriving of life or liberty the unfortunate victims of such propensities.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the mental and moral qualities of the lower animals differ from\r\nthose of man, not in kind, but only in degree, and the human mammal is\r\ndescended from a stock of primates, to which apes and bats belong, and\r\ndogs and cats and pigs are more remotely akin, it is difficult to\r\ndetermine the point at which moral and penal responsibility ceases in the\r\ndescending, or begins in the ascending scale of being. That beasts and\r\nbirds and even insects commit acts of violence, which in human agents\r\nwould be called crimes, and which spring from the same psychical causes\r\nand, as we have shown in another work (_Evolutionary Ethics and Animal\r\nPsychology._ New York: D. Appleton and Co.; London: William Heinemann,\r\n1898), are punished by the herd, the flock or the swarm in a more or less\r\njudicial manner, is undeniable. The zoöpsychologist Lacassagne divides the\r\ncriminal offences of animals into six classes or categories, the ground of\r\nthe classification being the motives which underlie and originate them.\r\nThe lowest or most rudimentary motive to crime in both man and beast is\r\nhunger, the operation of which is seen in the spectacle of one savage\r\nkilling another in order to get sole possession of a wild beast slain by\r\nthem in common, and in the ferocity of two dogs fighting over a bone.\r\nPerhaps the great majority of crimes afflicting society at the present\r\ntime have their origin in this source. Next to the desire of the\r\nindividual to preserve himself comes the desire to preserve his kind; this\r\nmotive is commonly considered a more generous impulse and is praised as\r\nparental affection. This earliest and most primitive of altruistic\r\nemotions is exceedingly strong in the lower animals, especially in those\r\nwhose offspring are comparatively helpless in infancy, as is the case\r\nwith all species of monkeys, and manifests itself not only in tender care\r\nof the young, but also in theft, robbery, and other acts of violence\r\ncommitted for their sake. The wanton love of destruction characterizes\r\nboth beasts and men; there are roughs and vandals among the former as well\r\nas among the latter, who take a malicious delight in doing injury to\r\npersons and property. Vanity and the desire of “showing off” play no small\r\npart in the wrongdoings of apes and apish men and women. Other incentives\r\nto crime are ambition, sexual passion, gregariousness, the concentrated\r\negoism and merciless brutality of a crowd even in the most civilized\r\ncommunities, the outrages so recklessly perpetrated by what a French\r\njurist, M. Tarde, calls “that impulsive and maniac beast, the mob.” It may\r\nbe remarked, too, that the kinds of criminal actions, which civilization\r\ntends to diminish among men, domestication tends to diminish among the\r\nlower animals.\r\n\r\nIf these statements be correct, why should not animals be held penally\r\nresponsible for their conduct as well as human beings? There are men\r\napparently less intelligent than apes. Why then should the man be\r\ncapitally punished and the ape not brought to trial? And if the ape be\r\nmade responsible and punishable, why not the dog, the horse, the pig, and\r\nthe cat? In other words, does evolutionary criminology justify the\r\njudicial proceedings instituted by mediæval courts against animals or\r\nregard the typical human criminal as having in this respect no supremacy\r\nover the beast? Does modern science take us back to the barbarities of the\r\nMiddle Ages in matters of penal legislation, and in abolishing judicial\r\nprocedure against quadrupedal beasts is it thereby logically forced to\r\nstay the hand of justice uplifted against bipedal brutes? The answer to\r\nthese questions is unhesitatingly negative. Zoöpsychology is the key to\r\nanthropopsychology and enables us to get a clearer conception of the\r\ngenesis of human crime by studying its manifestations in the lower\r\ncreation; we thus see it in the process of becoming, acquire a more\r\ncorrect appreciation of its nature and origin and learn how to deal with\r\nit more rationally and effectively in bestial man.\r\n\r\nAnother point discussed by Plato and still seriously debated by writers on\r\ncriminal jurisprudence is whether punishment is to be inflicted _quia\r\npeccatum est_ or _ne peccetur_; in other words, whether the object of it\r\nshould be retributive or preventive. The truth is, however, that both of\r\nthese motives are operative and as determining causes are so closely\r\nintermixed that it is impossible to separate them. As the distinguished\r\ncriminalist, Professor Von Liszt, has remarked one might as well ask\r\nwhether a sick man takes medicine because he is ill or in order to get\r\nwell. The penalty is imposed in consequence of the commission of a crime\r\nand also for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of it, and is\r\ntherefore both retributory and reformatory. Punishment is defined by Laas\r\nas “ethicized and nationalized revenge, exercised by the state or body\r\npolitic, which is alone impartial enough to pronounce just judgments and\r\npowerful enough to execute them.” Civilization takes vengeance out of the\r\nhands of the injured individual and delegates it to the community or\r\ncommonwealth, which has been outraged in his person. The underlying\r\nprinciple, however, is, in both cases, the same, and the idea of justice,\r\nas administered by the community, does not rise above that entertained by\r\nthe aggregate or average of individuals composing it.\r\n\r\nThe recent growth of sociology and especially the scientific study of the\r\nlaws of heredity thus tend, by exciting an intelligent interest in the\r\npsychological solution of such questions, to render men less positive and\r\nperemptory in their judicial decisions. The intellectual horizon is so\r\ngreatly enlarged and so many possibilities are suggested, that it is\r\ndifficult for conscientious persons, strongly affected by these\r\nspeculations and honestly endeavouring to make an ethical or penal\r\napplication of them, to come to a prompt and practical conclusion in any\r\ngiven case. The voice of decision loses its magisterial sternness and\r\n\r\n                  “the native hue of resolution\r\n  Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.”\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as Mr. Galton affirms, that legal ability is transmitted\r\nfrom father to son, criminal proclivity may be equally hereditary, and the\r\njudge and the culprit may have reached their relative positions through a\r\nline of ancestral influences, working according to immutable and\r\ninevasible laws of descent.\r\n\r\nSchopenhauer maintained the theory of “responsibility for character,” and\r\nnot for actions, which are simply the outgrowth and expression of\r\ncharacter. The same act may be good or bad according to the motives from\r\nwhich it springs. This distinction is constantly made both in ethics and\r\nin jurisprudence, and determines our moral judgments and judicial\r\ndecisions. Yet the chief elements, which enter into a person’s character\r\nand contribute to its formation, lie beyond his control or even his\r\nconsciousness, and in many cases have done their work before his birth.\r\nResponsibility for character is equivalent to responsibility for all the\r\ninherited tendencies and prenatal influences, of which character is the\r\nresultant, and leads at last to the theological dogma of the imputation of\r\nsin all the way back to Adam as the federal head of the race, a doctrine\r\nwhich Schopenhauer would be the first to repudiate. Besides, evil\r\npropensities and criminal designs are recognizable and punishable only\r\nwhen embodied in overt acts. The law cannot deprive a man of life or\r\nliberty because he is known to be vicious and depraved, although the\r\npolice in the exercise of its protective and preventive functions and as a\r\nmeans of providing for the general security, may feel in duty bound to\r\nkeep a watchful eye on him and to make an occasional raid on the dens and\r\n“dives” haunted by him and his kind. There are also instances on record,\r\nin which it is impossible to trace the culpable act to any marked\r\ncorruption of character.\r\n\r\nA rather remarkable illustration of this fact is furnished by the trial of\r\nMarie Jeanneret, which took place at Geneva in Switzerland in 1868 and\r\nwhich deservedly ranks high among the _causes célèbres_ of the present\r\ncentury, both as a legal question and a problem of psycho-pathology. [At\r\nthe time when this trial occurred, the writer directed attention to the\r\npeculiar and perplexing features of the case in _The Nation_ for January\r\n7, 1869, p. 11.] Dumas in his novel _Le Comte de Monte Christo_, describes\r\nthe character and career of a young, refined and beautiful woman, moving\r\nin the best circles of Parisian society, and yet poisoning successively\r\nsix or seven members of her own family; but even the most imaginative and\r\naudacious of French romancers did not dare to delineate such criminality\r\nwithout ascribing it to some apparently adequate motive. Madame de\r\nVillefort administered deadly potions to her relatives under the impulse\r\nof a morbidly intense maternal love, which centred all her moral and\r\nintellectual faculties on the idea of making her son the sole heir to a\r\nlarge estate. Affection and social ambition for her offspring incited her\r\nto the murder of her kin. But the invention, which created such a monster\r\nof sentimental depravity, has been far surpassed in real life by the\r\nexploits of Marie Jeanneret, a Swiss nurse, who took advantage of her\r\nprofessional position to give doses of poison to the sick persons confided\r\nto her care, from the effects of which seven of them died.\r\n\r\nIn the commission of this monotonous series of diabolical crimes, the\r\nculprit does not seem to have been animated either by animosity or\r\ncupidity. On the contrary, she always showed the warmest affection for her\r\nvictims, and nursed them with the tenderest care and the most untiring\r\ndevotion, as she watched the distressful workings of the fatal draught;\r\nnor did she derive the slightest material benefit from her course of\r\nconduct, but rather suffered considerable pecuniary loss by the death of\r\nher patients. The testimony of physicians and alienists furnished no\r\nevidence of insanity, nor did she show any signs of atavistic reversion,\r\nphysiological abnormity or hereditary homicidal bent. Monomaniacs usually\r\nact fitfully and impulsively; but Marie Jeanneret always manifested the\r\ncoolest premeditation and self-possession, never exhibiting the least\r\nhesitation or confusion, or the faintest trace of hallucination, but\r\nanswered with the greatest clearness and calmness every question put by\r\nthe president of the court. Even M. Turrettini, the prosecuting attorney,\r\nin presenting the case to the jury, was unable to discover any rational\r\nprinciple on which to explain the conduct and urge the conviction of the\r\naccused; and after exhausting the common category of hypotheses and\r\nshowing the inadequacy of each, he was driven by sheer stress of\r\ninexplicability to seek a motive in “_l’espèce de volupté qu’elle\r\néprouverait à commettre un crime_,” or what, in less elegant, but more\r\nvigorous Western vernacular, would be called “pure cussedness.” Not only\r\nwas such an explanation merely a circumlocutory confession of ignorance,\r\nbut it was wholly inconsistent with the general character of the indictee.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the persistent and pitiless perpetration of this one sort of crime\r\nby this woman, under circumstances which should have excited compassion in\r\nthe hardest human heart, seems more like the working of some baneful and\r\nirrepressible force in nature, or the relentless operation of a\r\ndestructive machine, than like the voluntary action of a free and\r\nresponsible moral agent. M. Zurlinden, the counsel for the defendant,\r\ndwelt with emphasis upon this mysterious phase of the case and thus saved\r\nhis client from the scaffold. The jury, after five hours’ deliberation,\r\nrendered a verdict of “Guilty, with extenuating circumstances,” as the\r\nresult of which the accused was sentenced to twenty years’ hard labour.\r\nAs a matter of fact, there were no circumstances of an extenuating\r\ncharacter except the utter inability of the jurors to discover any motive\r\nfor the commission of such a succession of cold-blooded atrocities.\r\n\r\nAfter fifteen years’ imprisonment the convict died. During this whole\r\nperiod of incarceration she not only showed great intelligence and strict\r\nintegrity, but was also remarkably kind and helpful to all with whom she\r\ncame in contact. She instructed her fellow-convicts in needle-work and\r\nfine embroidery, loved to attend them in sickness, and by her general\r\ninfluence raised very perceptibly the tone of morals in the workhouse. If\r\nit be true, as asserted by Mynheer Heymanns, one of the latest expounders\r\nof Schopenhauer’s ethics, that “a man is responsible for his actions only\r\nso far as his character finds expression in them, and is to be judged\r\nsolely by his character,” what shall be done in cases like the\r\nafore-mentioned, in which the criminal conduct is exceptional, and so far\r\nfrom being symptomatic of the general character stands out as an isolated\r\nand ugly excrescence and appalling abnormity? According to this theory\r\ncrime is to be punished only when it is the natural outgrowth and\r\nlegitimate fruit of the criminal’s individuality and society is to be left\r\nunprotected against all maleficence not traceable to such an origin.\r\n\r\nThere can be hardly any doubt that the Swiss nurse was a toxicomaniac and\r\nthat she had become infatuated with poisons, partly by watching their\r\neffects on her own system, and partly by reading about their properties in\r\nmedical and botanical works, to the study of which she was passionately\r\ndevoted. Did not Mithridates, if we may believe the statements of Galen,\r\nexperiment with poisons on living persons? Why should she not follow such\r\nan illustrious example, especially as she never hesitated to take herself\r\nthe potions she administered to others; the only difference being that\r\nhabit had made her, like the famous King of Pontus, proof against their\r\nvenom. She often attempted analyses of these substances, and in one\r\ninstance was severely burned by the bursting of a crucible, in which she\r\nwas endeavouring to obtain atropine from atropa belladonna or deadly\r\nnightshade. It was this terrible poison, which is endowed with exceedingly\r\nenergetic qualities and is therefore used by physicians with extreme\r\nprecaution, that seems to have had an irresistible fascination for her,\r\ngrowing into an insane desire to discover and test its occult virtues. She\r\nhad read and heard of zealous scientists and illustrious physicians, who\r\nhad experimented on themselves and on their disciples, and become the\r\nbenefactors of mankind; why then should she not adopt the same method in\r\nthe pursuit of truth and use for this purpose the physiological material\r\nwhich her profession placed in her hands?\r\n\r\nHowever preposterous such reasoning on her part may appear to us and\r\nhowever vaguely and subconsciously the mental process may have been\r\ncarried on, it offers the only theory adequate to explain all the facts\r\nand to account for the almost incredible union of contradictory traits in\r\nher character. The enthusiasm of the experimenter overbore in her the\r\nnative sympathy of the woman. She observed the writhings of her poisoned\r\nvictims with as “much delight” as Professor Mantegazza confesses he felt\r\nin studying the physiology of pain in the dumb animals “shrieking and\r\ngroaning” on his tormentatore. “The physiologist,” says Claude Bernard,\r\n“is no ordinary man. He is a savant, seized and possessed by a scientific\r\nidea. He does not hear the cries of suffering wrung from racked and\r\nlacerated creatures, nor see the blood which flows. He has nothing before\r\nhis eyes but his idea and the organisms, which are hiding the secrets he\r\nmeans to discover.” Marie Jeanneret was a fanatic of this kind. She, too,\r\nwas a woman possessed with ideas as witches were once supposed to be\r\npossessed with devils. Had she prudently confined her experiments to the\r\ntorture of helpless animals, she might perhaps have taken rank in the\r\nscientific world with Brachet, Magendie and other celebrated vivisectors,\r\nand been admitted with honour to the Academy, instead of being thrust\r\nignominiously into a penitentiary.\r\n\r\nThe assertion as regards any supposed case of madness, that “there’s\r\nmethod in it,” is popularly assumed to be equivalent to a denial of the\r\nexistence of the madness altogether. But psycho-pathology affords no\r\nwarrant for such an assumption. An individual, who commits murder under\r\nthe impulse of morbid jealousy, pecuniary distress, social rancour,\r\npolitical or scientific fanaticism, or any other form of monomania, is not\r\nthe less the victim of a mind diseased because he shows rational\r\nforethought in planning and executing the deed. His mental faculties may\r\nbe perfectly healthy and normal in their operation up to the point of\r\nderangement, from which the fatal act proceeds. No chain is stronger than\r\nits weakest link; and this is equally true of physical and psychical\r\nconcatenations. Under such circumstances the sane powers of the mind are\r\nall at the mercy of the one fault and are made to minister to this single\r\ninfirmity.\r\n\r\nAccording to English law a man is irresponsibly insane, when he has “such\r\ndefect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and\r\nquality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not\r\nknow he was doing what was wrong.” This definition is very incomplete and\r\ncovers only the most obvious forms of insanity; perhaps in the great\r\nmajority of cases there is no “defect of reason” nor “disease of mind” in\r\nthe proper sense of these terms, but only a disturbance of the emotions or\r\nperversion of the will originating in physical disorder. Besides, it is\r\nundeniable that animal intelligence is capable of distinguishing between\r\nright and wrong and of comprehending what is punishable and what is not\r\npunishable. In general when a dog does wrong, he knows that he is doing\r\nwrong; and a monkey often takes delight in doing what is wrong simply\r\nbecause he knows it is wrong. If a monkey gets angry and kills a child, he\r\nobeys the same vicious propensity that impels a brutal man to commit\r\nmurder. There is no greater “defect of reason” in one case than in the\r\nother. Why then should the monkey be summarily shot or knocked on the\r\nhead, and the man arrested, tried, convicted and hanged by the constituted\r\nauthorities? Simply because such a public prosecution and execution would\r\nnot exert any influence whatever in preventing infanticide on the part of\r\nother monkeys; if it could be shown that a formal trial of the monkey\r\nwould produce this salutary effect, then it certainly ought not to be\r\nomitted. The recent attempt to modify the English law so as to render all\r\n“certifiably insane” persons irresponsible for their actions, would result\r\nin the abolition of all punishment for crime, since many physicians regard\r\nevery criminal as insane and would not hesitate to certify their opinion\r\nto the proper tribunal.\r\n\r\nIt is no easy task now-a-days for penal legislation to keep pace with\r\npsychiatral investigation and to adjust itself to the wide range and nice\r\ndistinctions of modern psycho-pathology; nor is it necessary to do so.\r\n_Salus socialis suprema lex esto._ Society is bound to protect itself\r\nagainst every criminal assault, no matter what its source or character may\r\nbe. This is the ultimate object not only of the prison and the scaffold,\r\nbut also of all reformatories for juvenile offenders and vagabonds, who by\r\njudicious correction and instruction may perhaps be brought to amend their\r\nways and thus be prevented from becoming a social danger by swelling the\r\ndisorderly ranks of the permanently criminal classes. If a person proves\r\nto be unamenable to moral or penitential measures and remains an\r\nincorrigible transgressor, it is the duty of the community to set him\r\naside by death or by life-long durance. Penal legislation does not aim\r\nprimarily at the betterment of the individual; laws are enacted not for\r\nthe purpose of making men good and noble, but solely for the purpose of\r\nrendering them safe members of society. This is effected by depriving the\r\nirremediably vicious of their liberty and, if necessary, also of their\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe pardoning power, too, must be exercised with the utmost reserve and\r\ncircumspection. The state does not look upon public offences as sins but\r\nas crimes. The introduction of the theological conception of delinquencies\r\ninto the province of civil government has always been the vice of\r\nhierarchies and has never failed to work immense mischief by leading\r\ninevitably to impertinent intermeddling with matters of conscience and\r\nprivate opinion, putting a premium on pretended repentance and like\r\nhypocrisies, and converting the witness-box into a confessional and the\r\ncourt of justice into a court of inquisition. This has been uniformly the\r\nresult wherever a body of priests has become a body of rulers, endowed\r\nwith sovereignty in the administration of secular affairs.\r\n\r\nIf it could be conclusively proved or even rendered highly probable, that\r\nthe capital punishment of an ox, which had gored a man to death, deterred\r\nother oxen from pushing with their horns, it would be the unquestionable\r\nright and imperative duty of our legislatures and tribunals to re-enact\r\nand execute the old Mosaic law on this subject. In like manner, if it can\r\nbe satisfactorily shown that the hanging of an admittedly insane person,\r\nwho has committed murder, prevents other insane persons from perpetrating\r\nthe same crime, or tends to diminish the number of those who go insane in\r\nthe same direction, it is clearly the duty of society to hang such\r\npersons, whatever may be the opinion of the alienist concerning their\r\nmoral responsibility. Nor is this merely a hypothetical case or purely\r\nacademical question. It is a well-established fact, that the partially\r\ninsane, especially those affected with “moral insanity” or so-called\r\n“cranks,” have their intelligence intact, and are capable of exercising\r\ntheir reasoning powers freely and fully in laying their plans and in\r\ncarrying out their designs. Indeed, criminals of this class are sometimes\r\nknown to have entertained the thought that they would be acquitted on the\r\nground of insanity, and have thereby been emboldened to do the deed; and\r\nit is by no means impossible, but highly probable, that a belief in the\r\ncertainty of punishment would have acted as an effective deterrent. A case\r\nof this kind occurred in 1894 in England, where an inmate of a lunatic\r\nasylum deliberately murdered a lawyer, who was visiting the institution.\r\nThe murderer declared that he had no grudge against his victim, but\r\nbelieved himself to be persecuted in general and wished to call attention\r\nto his wrongs by assassinating some official or prominent person. His\r\nmethod of redress was that of the ordinary anarchist; and his confession\r\nthat he would not have dared to commit the act unless he had believed that\r\nas a certificated lunatic under confinement he ran no risk of being\r\nhanged, illustrates the point in question. There can be no doubt, for\r\nexample, that the execution of Guiteau for the assassination of Garfield\r\nhas greatly lessened the dangers of this kind to which the President of\r\nthe United States is exposed; just as the swift and severe punishment of\r\nthe Chicago anarchists has dampened the zeal and restrained the activity\r\nof the fanatics, who labour under the delusion that, in a free country,\r\ndynamite bombs are the fittest means of disseminating reformatory ideas\r\nand bringing about the social and political regeneration of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view it is hardly necessary to remark upon the\r\nabsurdity of Lombroso’s assertion that the jurists, who formerly condemned\r\nand punished animals, were more logical and consistent than those who now\r\npass sentence of death on cretins like Grandi or cranks (_grafomani\r\nmatteschi_) like Passannante and Guiteau (_Archivio di Psichiatria._\r\nTorino, 1881, Vol. II. Fasc. IV.), since he utterly ignores the preventive\r\ncharacter and purpose of judicial punishment and its practical utility in\r\nchecking the homicidal propensities of such persons, whereas the criminal\r\nprosecution and capital punishment of a pig for infanticide will not have\r\nthe slightest effect in preventing other pigs from mangling and devouring\r\nlittle children.\r\n\r\nThat animals might be deterred from doing violence to men by putting one\r\nof their kind to death and suspending its body as a scarecrow is\r\nmaintained by a distinguished writer in the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Hierolymus Rosarius, the nuntius of Pope Clement VII. to the\r\ncourt of Ferdinand I., then King of Hungary, who states that in Africa\r\ncrucified lions are placed near towns, and that other lions, however\r\nhungry they may be, are kept away through fear of the same punishment:\r\n_cujus pœnæ metu, licet urgeat fames, desinunt_. He records also that in\r\nriding from Cologne towards Düren, he and his companions saw in the vast\r\nforest two wolves in brogans hanging on a gallows, just like two thieves,\r\nas a warning to the rest of the pack: “Et nos ab Agrippina Colonia Duram\r\nversus equitantes in illa vasta silva, vidimus duos caligatos lupos non\r\nsecus quam duos latrones, furcæ suspensos; _quo similis pœnæ formidine a\r\nmaleficio reliqui deterreantur_.” In like manner the American farmer sets\r\nup a dead hawk as a deterrent for the protection of his hens. We may add\r\nthat Rosarius entertained a high opinion of the intelligence and moral\r\ncharacter of animals and wrote a book to prove their frequent superiority\r\nto men in the use of their rational faculties. This very clever and\r\noriginal work entitled: _Quod animalia bruta sæpe ratione utantur melius\r\nhomine_, was first published by Gabriel Naudé at Paris in 1648; an\r\nenlarged edition was issued by Ribow at Helmstedt in 1728, with a\r\ndissertation on the soul in animals.\r\n\r\nIn the class of ill-poised minds, yclept cranks, just mentioned, the\r\nspirit of imitation is peculiarly strong and morbidly contagious. The\r\ncelebrated psychiater, Baron Von Feuchtersleben, in his treatise _On the\r\nDiatetics of the Soul_, cites the case of a French soldier, who shot\r\nhimself in a sentry-box; soon afterwards, several other soldiers took\r\ntheir lives in the same manner and in the same place. Napoleon I. ordered\r\nthe sentry-box to be burned and thus put an end to the suicides. A similar\r\ninstance is recorded by Max Simon in his _Hygiène de l’esprit_, in which\r\nhe states that a workman hanged himself in the embrasure of a gate, and\r\nhis example was followed directly by a dozen of his fellows, so that it\r\nwas found necessary to wall up the gate in order to stop this strange\r\nepidemic. The same effect is produced by popular romances, in which the\r\nhero or heroine or both together dispose of themselves in this way;\r\nsometimes whole communities are thus infected by a single work of fiction;\r\nperhaps the most notable case of this kind in modern literature is the era\r\nof sentimentalism and suicidism which followed the publication of Goethe’s\r\n_Werther_. It is well known, too, that another class of sensational\r\nnovels, the plots of which consist in the development of criminal\r\nintrigues, tend to promote crime by rendering it fascinating and\r\nindicating an attractive and exciting method of perpetrating it. We have a\r\nrecent and very striking instance of this kind in the origin and evolution\r\nof the notorious Dreyfus affair. In June 1893, a year and a half before\r\nthe arrest of Dreyfus, a novel entitled _Les Deux Frères_, by Louis\r\nLetang, appeared in the Paris _Petit Journal_, the plot of which may be\r\nconcisely described as follows. A young and capable officer, Captain\r\nPhilippe Dormelles, who holds a position of confidence in the French\r\ndepartment of war, is envied and hated by two colleagues named Aurélien\r\nand Daniel. Their enmity and jealousy finally become so intense that they\r\nconspire to effect his ruin by accusing him of selling to a foreign power\r\nthe secrets of the national defence. It is arranged that a compromising\r\nletter imitating the handwriting of Dormelles and addressed to a foreign\r\nmilitary _attaché_ shall be placed in the secret archives, where it will\r\nfall into the hands of the head of the department Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nAlleward. Dormelles is arrested and thrown into the prison Cherche-Midi,\r\nand at the same time Daniel causes a violent article to be inserted in a\r\nnewspaper _Le Vigilant_, charging him with high treason, and seeking to\r\nexcite public opinion against him. This article concludes with the false\r\nstatement that a search in Dormelles’ department had led to the discovery\r\nof important documents referring to the fabrication of smokeless powder,\r\nand that thereupon Dormelles had confessed his guilt. He is then sentenced\r\nto the galleys, but his betrothed is convinced of his innocence and\r\nfinally succeeds in detecting and exposing the forgeries.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Alleward is arrested and commits suicide in prison,\r\nnot with a razor like Henry, but with a revolver. One scene in the novel\r\ndescribes the appearance of a veiled lady on the very spot near the Champs\r\nElysées, where the mysterious veiled lady is said to have appeared to\r\nEsterhazy three years later and for much the same purpose. The French\r\nminister of war, Mercier, was forced to proceed against Dreyfus by the\r\n_Libre Patrole_, which published lies about his confession, as _Le\r\nVigilant_ did about Dormelles. The only rational explanation of this\r\nremarkable concurrence of events, as they are narrated in the fiction and\r\nafterwards occurred in fact, is that the method of conducting the\r\nconspiracy against Dreyfus and the possibility of accomplishing it were\r\nsuggested by Letang’s story, although the conspirators doubtless did not\r\nanticipate that the logic of events would render the results of their\r\nfalsehoods and forgeries as fatal to them as they were to their prototypes\r\nin the novel. Every scoundrel is firmly convinced that he can pattern\r\nafter his precursors in villainy, avoid their mistakes and commit the same\r\ncrime without incurring the same penalty.\r\n\r\nThat paroxysms of epilepsy, hysterics and various forms of frenzy are\r\ncontagious and may be easily communicated to nervous persons, who witness\r\nthem, has been clearly proved. Vicious passions obey the same law of\r\nimitation even in a still higher degree than tender emotions and nervous\r\ndiseases, and more than two centuries ago the illustrious jurisconsult,\r\nSamuel Pufendorf, laid down the general principle that he who for the\r\nfirst time commits a crime liable to spread by contagion and to become\r\nvirulent, should be punished with extreme severity, in order that it may\r\nnot infect others and create a moral pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe hemp cure is always a harsh cure, especially where there is any doubt\r\nas to the offender’s mental soundness; but in view of the increasing\r\nfrequency with which atrocious and wilful crime shelters itself under the\r\nplea of insanity and becomes an object of misdirected sympathy to maudlin\r\nsentimentalists, the adoption of radical and rigorous measures in the\r\ninfliction of punishment were perhaps an experiment well worth trying.\r\nMeanwhile, let the psychiater continue his researches, and after we have\r\npassed through the present confused and perilous period of transition from\r\ngross and brutal mediæval conceptions of justice to refined and\r\nhumanitarian modern conceptions of justice, we may, in due time, succeed\r\nin establishing our penal code and criminal procedure upon foundations\r\nthat shall be both philosophically sound and practically safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nCONTAINING ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALES ET REASSUMPTUM\r\n\r\nAnno domini millesimo quingentesimo octuagesimo septimo et die decima\r\ntertia mensis aprilis comparuit in bancho actorum judicialium episcopatus\r\nMaurianne honestus vir Franciscus Ameneti scindicus et procurator\r\nprocuratorioque nomine totius communitatis et parrochie Sancti Julliani\r\nqui in causa quam pretendunt reassumere prosequi aut de novo intentare\r\ncoram reverendissimo domino Maurianne episcopo et principe seu reverendo\r\ndomino generali ejus Vicario et Officiali contra Animalia ad formam\r\nmuscarum volantia coloris viridis communi voce appellata Verpillions seu\r\nAmblevins facit constituit elegit et creavit certum ac legitimum\r\nprocuratorem totius dicte communitatis et substituit vigore sui\r\nscindicatus de quo fidem faciet egregium Petremandum Bertrandi causidicum\r\nin curiis civitatis Maurianne presentem et acceptantem ad fines coram\r\neodem reverendissimo Episcopo et ejus Vicario generali comparendi et\r\nfaciendi quicquid circa negotiis ejusdem cause spectat et pertinet et\r\nprout ipse scindicus facere posset si presens et personaliter interesset\r\ncum electione domicillii et ceteris clausulis relevationis ratihabitionis\r\net aliis opportunis suo juramento firmatis subque obligatione et hypotheca\r\nbonorum suorum et dicte communitatis que conceduntur in bancho die et anno\r\npremissis.\r\n\r\nORDINATIO\r\n\r\nAnno domini millesimo quinquagesimo octuagesimo septimo et die sabatti\r\ndecima sexta maii comparuerunt judicialiter coram nobis Vicario generali\r\nMaurianne prefato Franciscus Ameneti conscindicus Sancti Julliani cum\r\negregio Petremando Bertrandi ejus procuratore producens testimoniales\r\nconstitutionis facte eidem egregio Bertrandi die tertia decima aprilis\r\nproxime fluxi petit sibi provideri juxta supplicationem nobis porrectam\r\nparte scindicorum et communitatis Sancti Julliani exordiente _Divino\r\nprimitus implorato auxilio_ signatum _Franciscus Faeti_ contra Animalia\r\nbruta ad formam muscarum volantia nuncupata Verpillions producens etiam\r\nacta et agitata superioribus annis coram predecessoribus nostris maxime de\r\nanno 1545 et die vicesima secunda mensis aprilis unacum ordinatione nostra\r\nlata octava maii millesimo quingentesimo octuagesimo sexto et ne contra\r\nAnimalia ipsis inauditis procedi videatur petunt sibi provideri de\r\nadvocato et procuratore pro defensione si quam habeant aut habere possent\r\ndictorum Animalium se offerentes ad solutionem salarii illis per nos\r\nassignandi.

Cf. _Mémoires de la Société Royale Académique de\r\nSavoie_, Tome xii. pp. 524-57, where it first appeared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to M. J. Desnoyers (_Recherches sur la coutume d’exorciser et\r\nd’excommunier les insectes et autres animaux nuisibles à l’agriculture_,\r\np. 15), it is still the custom, in Provence, Languedoc, le Bordelais, and\r\nother provinces of France, for the peasants to ask the country curates for\r\nprayers, sprinklings with holy water, consecrated boughs, and\r\nextraordinary processions, for the purpose of expelling noxious insects\r\nfrom the vineyards and warding off disease from the grapes and the\r\nsilkworms. These ceremonies are accompanied with adjurations and\r\nmaledictions. In Protestant lands official days of fasting and prayer are\r\nsupposed to produce the same results.\r\n\r\nThe form of exorcism given by an Antwerp canon, Maximilian d’Eynatten, in\r\nhis _Manuale Exorcismorum_, is as follows:--“Exorcizo et adjuro vos,\r\npestiferi vermes, per Deum patrem omnipotentem ✠, et per Jesum Christum ✠\r\nfilium ejus Dominum nostrum, et Spiritum Sanctum ✠ ab utroque procedentem,\r\nut confestim recedatis ab his campis, pratis, hortis, vineis, aquis, si\r\nDei providentia adhùc vitam vobis indulgeat, nec amplius in eis habitetis,\r\nsed ad illa ac talia loca transeatis, ubi nullis Dei servis nocere\r\npoteritis. Vobis, si per maleficium diabolicum hic estis, pro parte\r\ndivinae majestatis, totius curiae coelestis, necnon ecclesiae hic adhùc\r\nmilitantis, impero, ut deficiatis in vobisipsis, ac decrescatis, quatenus\r\nreliquiae de vobis nullae reperiantur, nisi ad gloriam Dei et ad usum et\r\nsalutem humanum conducibiles. Quod praestare dignetur qui venturus est\r\njudicare viros et mortuos et saeculum per ignem, Resp.--Amen.” _Thesaurus\r\nExorcismorum, Coloniae_, 1626, p. 1204.\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\nII[4]\r\n\r\nDE L’EXCELLENCE DES MONITOIRES\r\n\r\nPAR GASPARD BAILLY\r\n\r\nIl ne favt pas mépriser les Monitoires, veu que c’est vne chose grandement\r\nimportante, portant auec soy le glaiue, le plus dangereux dont nostre Mere\r\nsainte l’Eglise se sert, qui est l’Excommunication, qui taille aussi bien\r\nle bois sec que le verd, n’épargnant ny les viuans, ni les morts; et ne\r\nfrappe pas seulement les Creatures raisonnables, mais s’attache aux\r\nirraisonnables, tels que sont les animaux. Les exemples en sont fréquens,\r\npour preuue de cette verité. Car on a veu en plusieurs endroits qu’on a\r\nexcommunié les bestioles et insectes, qui apportoient du dommage aux\r\nfruits de la terre, et obeïssans aux commandemens de l’Eglise se\r\nretiroient dans le lieu ordonné par la sentence de l’Euesque qui leur\r\nformoit leur procès. Au Siecle passé, il y auoit telle quantité\r\nd’Anguilles dans le Lac de Geneue, qu’elles gastoient tout le Lac: De sort\r\nque les Habitans de la Ville et enuirons, recoururent à l’Euesque pour\r\nles Excommunier, ce qu’ayant esté fait, le Lac fut deliuré de ces\r\nanimaux.\r\n\r\nDu temps de Charles Duc de Bourgogne fils de Philippe le Bon, il y eut\r\ntelle quantité de Sauterelles en Bresse, en Italie qu’elles mirent presque\r\nla famine dans tout le Mantoüan, si on n’y eût apporté du secours par\r\nl’Excommunication, et de ce nous parle Altiat dans ses Emblémes, sous\r\nl’intitulation _nihil reliqui_.\r\n\r\n  _Scilicet hoc deerat post tot mala denique nostris,\r\n    Locustæ vt raperent, quidquid inesset agris.\r\n  Uidimus innumeras Euro Duce tendere turmas;\r\n    Qualia non Athilæ, Castrave Cersis erant.\r\n  Hæ fænum milium farra omnia consumpserunt;\r\n    Spes in Augusto est, stant nisi vota super._\r\n\r\nOn raconte en la vie de S. Bernard, qu’il se leua vne si grande quantité\r\nde Mouches, d’vne Eglise qu’on auoit basti à Loudun, que par le myen du\r\nbruit qu’elles faisoient, elles empéchoient à ceux qui entroient de prier\r\nDiev, ce que voyant le S. Personage il les Excommunia, de sorte qu’elles\r\ntomberent toutes mortes ayant couuert le paué de l’Eglise.\r\n\r\nNous lisons qu’en l’année 1541, il y eut vne telle quantité de Sauterelles\r\nen Lombardie, qui tomberent d’vne nuëé; qu’ayant mangé les fruits de la\r\nterre, elles causerent la famine en ces lieux-la. Elles estoient longues\r\nd’vne doigt, grosse teste, le ventre remply de vilenie et ordure;\r\nlesquelles estant mortes infecterent l’Air de si mauuaises odeurs, que les\r\nCourbeaux et autres animaux carnassiers ne les pouuoient supporter.\r\n\r\nOn dit aussi qu’en Pologne il y eut aussi telle quantité de ces animaux au\r\ncommencement sans aisles, et apres ils en eurent quatre, qu’ils couuroient\r\ndeux mille, et d’vne coudée d’auteur, et tellement épaisses qu’en volant\r\nelles leuoient la veüe de la clarté du Soleil, ces animaux firent un\r\ndégat non-pareil aux biens de la terre, et ne purent estre chassés par\r\nautre force ny industrie, que par la malediction Ecclesiastique.\r\n\r\nSaint Augustin raconte au Liure de la Cité de Dieu, Chap. dernier, qu’en\r\nAfrique il y eut telle quantité de Sauterelles, et si prodigieuses,\r\nqu’ayans mangé tous les fruits, feüiles, et écorces des arbres iusques à\r\nla racine, elles s’éleuerent comme vne nuëe; et tombées en la Mer,\r\ncauserent vne peste si forte, qu’en vn seul Royaume il y morut huit cens\r\nmille Habitans.\r\n\r\nDu temps de Lotaire troisième Empereur apres Charlemagne, il y eut dans la\r\nFrance des Sauterelles en nombre prodigieux, ayans six aisles auec deux\r\ndents plus dures que de pierre, qui couurirent toute la terre, comme de la\r\nneige, et gasterent tous les fruits, arbres, blé, et foins, et tels\r\nanimaux ayans esté jettés à la Mer; il s’ensuiuit vne telle corruption en\r\nl’Air, que la peste rauageât grande quantité de monde en ce pays là. Voilà\r\nquantité d’exemples quo nous font voir le dommage que nous apportent ces\r\nbestioles et insectes. Maintenant voyons comme on leur forme leur procés\r\nafin de s’en garantir par le moyen de la malédiction que leur donne\r\nl’Eglise.\r\n\r\nPremièrement, sur la Requeste presentée par les Habitans du lieu qui\r\nsouffrent le dommage, on fait informer sur le dégat que tels animaux ont\r\nfait, et estoient en danger de faire, laquelle information rapportée, le\r\nJuge Ecclesiastique donne vn Curateur à ses bestioles pour se présenter en\r\njugement, par Procureur, et là deduire toutes leurs raisons, et se\r\ndefendre contre les Habitans qui veulent leur faire quitter le lieu, où\r\nelles estoient, et les raisons veuës et considerées, d’vne part et d’autre\r\nil rend sa Sentence. Ce que vous verrez clairement par le moyen du\r\nplaidoyer suiuant.\r\n\r\n_Requeste des Habitans_\r\n\r\nSvpplie hvmblement N. Exposans comme riere le liieu de N. il y a quantité\r\nde Souris, Taupes, Sauterelles et autres animaux insectes, qui mangent les\r\nblés, vignes et autres fruits de la terre, et font vn tel dégat aux blés,\r\net raisins qu’ils n’y laissent rien, d’où les pauures supplians souffrent\r\nnotable prejudice, la prise pendante par racine estant consommée par ces\r\nanimaux, ce qui causera vne famine insupportable.\r\n\r\nQui les fait recourir à la Bonté, Clemence et Misericorde de Dieu, à ce\r\nqu’il vous plaise faire en sorte que ces animaux ne gastent, et mangent\r\nles fruits de la terre qu’il a pleu à Dieu d’enuoyer pour l’entretient des\r\nhommes, afin que les supplians puissent vacquer, auec plus de deuotions au\r\nseruice Diuin, et sur ce il vous plaira pouruoir.\r\n\r\n_Plaidoyer des Habitans_\r\n\r\nMessievrs, ces pauures Habitans qui sont à genouy les larmes à l’œil,\r\nrecourent à votre Iustice, comme firent autre-fois ceux des Isles Maiorque\r\net Minorque, qui enuoyerent vers Aug. Cesar pour demander des Soldats,\r\nafin de les defendre, et exempter du rauage que les Lapins leur faisoient:\r\nvous aués des armes plus fortes que les Soldats de cette Empereur pour\r\ngarantir les pauures supplians de la faim et necessité de laquelle ils\r\nsont menacés, par le rauage que font ces bestioles, qui n’épargnent ny\r\nblé, ny vignes; rauage semblable à celuy que faisoit vn Sanglier, qui\r\ngasta toutes les Terres, Vignes, et Oliuiers du Royaume de Calidon, dont\r\nparle Homere dans le premier Liure de son Hiliade, ou de ce Renard qui fut\r\nenuoyé par Themis à Thebes, qui n’épargnoit ny les fruits de la terre, ny\r\nle bestail attaquant les Paysans mesmes. Vous sçauez assez les maux que\r\nraporte la faim, vous aués trop de douceur, et de Iustice pour les laisser\r\nengager dans cette misere qui contraint à s’abandonner à des choses\r\nillicites, et cruelles, _nec enim rationem patitur, nec vlla æequitate\r\nmitigatur: nec prece vlla flectitur esuriens populus_: Témoins les Meres\r\ndont il est parlé au quatrième des Roys, qui pendant la famine de Samarie,\r\nmangerent les enfans, l’une de l’autre. _Da filium tuum, vt comedamus\r\nhodie, et filium meum comedimus cras: Coximus ergo filium meum, et\r\ncomedimus. Quid turpe non cogit fames, sed nihil turpe, nihilve, vetitum\r\nesuriens credit, sola enim cura est, vt qualicumque sorte iuuetur._ La\r\nmort qui vient par la famine est la plus cruelle entant qu’elle est pleine\r\nde langueurs, débilités et foiblesses de cœur, qui sont autant de\r\nnouuelles, et diuerses especes de mort.\r\n\r\n  _Dura quidem miseris, mors est, mortalibus omnis,\r\n  At perijsse fame, Res vna miserrima longè est._\r\n\r\nEt Auian Marcellin dit, _Mortis grauissimum genus, et vltimum malorum fame\r\nperire_. Ie crois que vous aurés compassion, de ce pauuve Peuple, si on\r\nvous le represente, par aduance en l’estat qu’il serait reduit si la faim\r\nl’accabloit.\r\n\r\n  _Hirtus erat crinis, cana lumina, pallor in ore,\r\n  Labia incana siti, scabri rubigine dentes.\r\n  Dura cutis, per quam spectari viscera possunt.\r\n  Ossa sub incuruis extabant arida lumbis;\r\n  Ventus erat, pro ventre locus._\r\n\r\nLes Gabaonistes, reuestus d’habits dechirés, et des visages affamés, auec\r\nde contenances toutes tristes, firent pitié et compassion au grand\r\nCapitaine Iousë, et en cét estar obtiendrent grace et misericorde.\r\n\r\nLes Informations et visites qui ont esté faites par vos commandements,\r\nvous instruisent suffisamment du dégat que ces animaux ont fait. Ensuite\r\ndequoy on a fait les formalités requises et necessaires, ne restant plus\r\nmaintenant que d’adjuger les fins et conclusions prises par la Requeste\r\ndes demandeurs, qui sont ciuiles et raisonnables, sur lesquelles il vois\r\nplaira de fairé reflection, et à cét effet leur enioindre de quitter le\r\nlieu et se retirer dans la place qui leur sera ordonnées en faisant les\r\nexecrations requises et necessaires, ordonnées par nostre Mere Sainte\r\nl’Eglise, à quoy les pauures demandeurs concluent.\r\n\r\n_Plaidoyer pour les Insectes_\r\n\r\nMessievrs, dépuis que vous m’aués choisi pour la defense ces pauures\r\nbestioles, il vois plaira que je remontre leur droit, et fasse voir que\r\nles formalités, qu’on a faites contre elles, sont nulles: m’étonnant fort\r\nde la façon qu’on en vse, on donne des plaintes contre elles, comme si\r\nelles auoient commis quelque crime, on fait informer du dégat qu’on\r\npretend qu’elles ayent fait, on les fait assigner par-deuant le Juge pour\r\nrespondre, et comme on sçait qu’elles sont muettes, le Juge voulant\r\nsuppleer à ce defaut, leur donne vn Aduocat, pour representer en Justice\r\nles raisons qu’elles ne peuuent deduire; et parceq; Messieurs, il vous a\r\npleu de me donner la liberté de parler pour les pauures animaux, je diray\r\npour leur defence en premier lieu.\r\n\r\nQve l’adiovrnement laxé contr’elles est nul comme laxé contre des bestes,\r\nqui ne peuuent, ny doiuent se presenter en jugement; la raison est, que\r\nceluy qu’on appelle, doit estre capable de raison, et doit agir librement,\r\npour pouuoir connoitre vn delict. Or est-il que les animaux estans priués\r\nde cette lumiere qui a esté donnée au seul homme, il faut conclurre par\r\nnecessaire consequence, que telle procedure est nulle; cecy est tiré de la\r\nLoi premieree, _ff. si quadrupes, pauper feciss. dicat_; et voyci les\r\nmots. _Nec enim potest animal, iniuriam fecisse, quod sensu caret._\r\n\r\nLa seconde raison est, que l’on ne peut appeller personne en jugement sans\r\ncause; car autrement celuy qui fait adjourner quelqu’vn sans raison, il\r\ndoit subir la peine portée sous le tiltre des instituts _de pœn. tem.\r\nlitig._ Mais ces animaux ne sont obligés par aucune cause, ny en aucune\r\nfaçon, _non tenentur enim ex contractu_, estans incapables de contracter,\r\n_neque ex quasi contractu, neque ex stipulatione, neque ex pacto_, moins\r\n_ex delicto, seu quasi_; parce que comme il a esté dit cy-deuant, pour\r\ncommettre vn crime, il faut estre capable de raison, qui ne se rencontre\r\npas aux animaux, qui sont priués de son vsage.\r\n\r\nDe plus dans la Iustice, on ne doit rien faire qui ne porte coup, la\r\nIustice en cela imitant la Nature; laquelle, comme dit le Philosophe, ne\r\nfait rien mal à propos, _Deus enim, et Natura nihil operantur frustra_. Je\r\nlaisse à penser quest-ce qu’on pretend de faire ayant adjourné ces\r\nbestioles, elles ne viendront pas respondre; car elles sont muettes, elles\r\nne constitueront pas des Procureurs, pour defendre leur cause, moins leur\r\ndonneront des memoires, pour deduire en jugement, leur raison: Car elles\r\nsont priuées de raisonnement, en sorte que tel adjournement ne pouuant\r\nauoir aucun effect, est nul. Si donc l’adjournement qui est la base de\r\ntous les actes judiciels est nul, le reste comme en dependant, ne pourra\r\nsubsister _cum enim principalis causa non consistat, neque ea quæ\r\nconsequuntur locum habent_.\r\n\r\nOn dira peut-estre que si bien tels animaux, ne peuuent constituer vn\r\nProcureur, pour la defense de leur droict, et instruction de leur cause\r\nque le Juge de son office le peut faire, et partant que le fait du Juge,\r\nest le fait de la partie. A cela on respond qu’il est vray lors qu’il le\r\nfait selon la disposition du droict, _In administratione suæ\r\niurisdictionis_, mais non pas en ce cas, où la partie n’en pouuait\r\nconstituer, le Juge aussi, ne le peut faire, cecy est décidé par la glose\r\nde la Loy 2 _ff. de administrat. res ad Civit. pertinent_, et pour preuue\r\nde cette proposition faite à propos L’axiaume qui dit _quod directè fieri\r\nprohibetur, per indirectum concedi non debet, cap. tuae de procuratoribus,\r\ngloss. c. 1. de consanguinibus, et affinibus_. Mais ce que je treuue plus\r\nestrange, on pretend faire prononcer contre ces pauures animaux vne\r\nSentence d’Excommunication, d’Anathema et malediction, et à quel sujet\r\nvser contre des bestioles qui sont sans defense, du plus rigoureux glaiue\r\nque l’Eglise aye en sa main, qui ne punit et ne châtie que les Criminels;\r\nces animaux estans incapables de faire faute, ni peché, parce que pour\r\npecher il faut auoir la lumiere de la raison laquelle dicernant le bien\r\nd’auec le mal, nous monstre ce qu’il faut suiure, et ce qu’il faut fuir,\r\net de plus il faut auoir la liberté de prendre l’vn et laisser l’autre.\r\n\r\nOn vovdra peut-estre dire qu’elles ont manqué en ce qu’elles ne se sont\r\npresentées ayant esté adjurnées, et partant que la Contumace et defaut\r\nestant vn crime, on peut faire rendre contre elles Sentence Contumaciale,\r\nà cause de leur desobeïssance: Mais à cela on respond qu’il ny a point de\r\nContumace, ou il n’y a point d’adjournement, ou du moins qui soit valable\r\n_quia paria sunt non esse citatum, vel non esse legitimè citatum, ita dd.\r\ncommuniter Bartol., in l. ea quae C. quomodo_, etc.\r\n\r\nDe plus, si on prend garde à la définition de l’Excommunication, on verra\r\nqu’on ne peut prononcer telle Sentence contre ces animaux: car\r\nl’Excommunication est dite _extra Ecclesiam positio, vel è qualibet\r\ncommunione, vel è quolibet legitimo actu separatio_. Tellement que tels\r\nanimaux ne peuuent estre dechassés de l’Eglise, n’y ayans jamais esté,\r\nd’autant qu’elle est pour les hommes qui ont l’ame raisonnable, non pas\r\npour les brutes, qui ne sont doüées d’aucune raison, et l’Apostre S. Paul\r\n_ad Corinth._ 5 dit _quòd de iis quae foris sunt nihil ad nos quoad\r\nExcommunicationem, quia Excommunicare non possumus_, l’Excommunication\r\n_afficit animam non corpus, nisi per quandam consequentiam, cuius Medicina\r\nest_, cap. 1, _de sentent. Excomm. in_ 6. C’est pourquoy l’ame de ces\r\nanimaux, n’estant immortelle, elle ne peut estre touchée par telle\r\nSentence, _quae vergit in dispendium aeternae salutis_.\r\n\r\nL’autre raison est, _quòd facienti actum permissum non imputatur, id quod\r\nsequitur ex illo, licét consecutiuum sit repugnans statui_ suo cap. _de\r\noccidendis_ 23 q. 5 cap. _sicut dignum extra de homicid_. Ces animaux font\r\nvn acte permis mesme par le droit Diuin. Car il est dit dans la Genese\r\n_fecit Deus bestias terrae iuxta species suas, iumenta, et omne reptile\r\nterrae in genere suo dixitque Deus, ecce dedi vobis, omnem herbam\r\nafferentem semen super terram, et vniuersa ligna, quae habent in\r\nsemetipsis sementem generis sui, vt sint vobis in escam; et cunctis\r\nanimalibus terrae, omnique volucri coeli, vniversis quae mouentur in\r\nterris, et in quibus est anima viuens; vt habeat ad vescendum_. Que si les\r\nfruits de la terre ont esté faits pour les animaux et pour les hommes, il\r\nleur est permis d’en manger et prendre leur nourriture, aussi Cicéron dit\r\nau premier des Offices _principio generi omnium animantium est à natura\r\nattributum, vt se vitam, corpusque tueantur, quaeque ad vescendum\r\nnecessaria sunt inquirant_. Par ces raison on voit qu’ils n’ont commis\r\naucun delict, ayant fait ce qui leur est permis par le droit Diuin et de\r\nNature, et par ainsi ils ne peuuent estre punis, ny maudis, _cum etiam\r\ncreaturae intellettuali, et rationali delinquenti seu damnum afferenti, eo\r\nquòd secundum solitum facit; non est Angelo licitum maledicere, multo\r\nminùs erit licitum homini_, veu qu’on lit dans l’Epistre de S. Iude, _cum\r\naltercaretur Michaël cum Diabolo de corpore Moysis non fuit ausus\r\nmaledicere_ Cap. _Si igitur Michaël_, 23. _q._ 3. S. Thomas 2. 2. _q._ 76.\r\ndit que de donner des maledictions aux choses irraisonnables, estans\r\nCreatures de Dieu s’est peché de blasphemer et de les maudire, les\r\nconsidérans en eux mesmes, _est otiosum, et vanum, et per consequens\r\nillicitum_.\r\n\r\nQue si toutes ces raisons ne vous touchent, peut-estre cette-cy vous féra\r\ndonner les mains, et persuadera à vostre Esprit, qu’on ne peut donner\r\naucune sentence d’Excommunication contre elles ny jetter aucun Anatheme.\r\nCar prononçant telle Sentence s’est s’en pendre à Dieu, qui par sa justice\r\nle enuoye pour punir les hommes et chastier leurs péchés, _immitamque in\r\nvos bestias agri quae consumant vos, et pecora vestra, et ad paucitatem\r\ncuncta redigant_, pouuant dire maintenant ce que Dieu a dit auant le\r\nDeluge _omnis Caro corrupit viam suam_. Et Ouide en ses Metamorphoses\r\nvoyant que le vice auoit pris le haut bout, Triomphant, et faisant des\r\nconquestes par tout, au contraire la vertu estoit abaissée, exilée, et\r\nreduite en tel estat qu’elle ne treuuoit aucune demeure parmy les Hommes.\r\n\r\n  _Protinus irrupit venæ prioris in æuum,\r\n  Omne nefas, fugere pudor, verùmque fidésque,\r\n  In quorum subiere locum, fraudésque, dolùsque.\r\n  Insidiæque, et ars, et amor sceleratus habendi,\r\n  Uiuitur ex rapto, non hospes ab hospite tutus,\r\n  Non socer à genero, fratrum quoquè gratia rara est,\r\n  Imminet exitio vir, conjugis, illa mariti\r\n  Liuida terribiles miscent aconitæ nouercæ\r\n  Filius ante diem, patrios inquirit in annos,\r\n  Uita iacet pietas, et virgo cæde madentes.\r\n  Ultima Cilestum, Terras Astrea reliquit._\r\n\r\nPar les quelles raisons on voit, que ces animaux sont en nous\r\nabsolutoires, et doiuent estre mis hors de Cour et de Procès, à quoy on\r\nconclud.\r\n\r\n_Replique des Habitans_\r\n\r\nLe principal motif qu’on a rapporté pour la deffense de ces animaux, est\r\nqu’estans priués de l’vsage de la raison, ils ne sont sommis à aucunes\r\nLoix, ainsi que dit le Chapitre _cum mulier_ 1. 5. q. l. la _l. congruit\r\nin fin_. et la Loix suiuante. _ff. de off. Praesid. sensu enim carens non\r\nsubjicitur rigori Iuris Ciuilis._ Toutesfois, on fera voir que telles Loys\r\nne peuuet militer au fait qui se présente maintenant à juger, car on ne\r\ndispute pas de la punition d’vn delict commis; Mais on tasche d’empescher\r\nqu’ils n’en commettent par cy-après, et partant ce qui ne seroit loisible\r\nà vn crime commis, et permis afin d’empescher _ne crimen committatur_.\r\nCecy ce preuue par la Loy _congruit_ sus cité, où il est dit qu’on ne peut\r\npas punir vn furieux et insensé du crime qu’il a commis pendant sa fureur,\r\nparce qu’il ne scait ce qu’il fait, toutesfois on le pourra renfermer et\r\nmettre dans des prisons, afin qu’il n’offence personne et pour faire voir\r\ncombien cét Axiome est vray, ie me sers de l’authorité du Chapitre _omnis\r\nvtriusque sexus de poenitent. et remiss._ ou il est dit qu’on peut\r\ndeceller ce qu’on a pris si on ne la pas executé, afin d’y rapporter du\r\nremede, cette proposition est confirmée par la glose _in cap. tua nos ext.\r\nde sponsal._ qui dit qui si quelqu’vn s’accuse d’auoir Fiancé une fille,\r\npar parolles de présent; on pourra deceller ce qui a esté dit, afin que le\r\nMariage se consume. La raison est, qu’ayant espousé telle fille, si on nie\r\nde l’auoir fait, et on refuse d’accomplir le Mariage, _Videtur esse\r\ndelictum successiuum, et durare vsque illam acceperit, vt ergo tali\r\ndelicto obuietur_. Il este loisible de publier ce qu’on a pris\r\nsecretement Estant vray par les raisons deduites qu’on a peu adjourner,\r\ntels animaux, et que l’adjournement est valable, d’autant qu’il est fait\r\nafin qu’ils ne rapportent du dommage d’ores en auant, non pas pour les\r\nchastier de celuy qu’ils ont fait. Il reste maintenant de respondre à ce\r\nqu’on a aduancé à sçauoir que tels animaux ne peuuent estre Excommuniés,\r\nAnathematisés, maudis ny execrés; à cela il semble que se serait doubter\r\nde la puissance que Dieu a donné à l’Eglise, l’ayant fait Maitresse de\r\ntout l’Vnivers, comme sa chere Espouse, de qui on peut dire, auec le\r\nPsalmiste, _omnia subiecisti sub pedibus ejus, oues, et boues et omnia quæ\r\nmouentur in aquis_, et estant conduite par le S. Esprit, ne fait rien que\r\nsagement, et s’il y a chose où elle doiue monstrer son pouuoir, c’est à la\r\nConservation du plus parfait ouurage de son Espoux; à sçauoir de l’Homme,\r\nqu’il a fait à son Image et semblance, _faciamus hominem, ad imaginem, et\r\nsimilitudinem nostram_ et luy a donné le Gouuernement de toutes les choses\r\ncrées _crescite et multiplicamini et dominamini piscibus maris,\r\nvolatilibus cœli, et omnibus animantibus Cœli_; Aussi Pline en son Liure\r\npremier de l’Histoire naturelle dit _quod causâ hominis, videtur cuncta\r\nalia genuisse natura_. Les Jurisconsultes sont d’accord, _quod hominis\r\ngratia, omnes fructus à natura comparati sunt, l. pecudum. ff. de vsur. et\r\n§. partus ancillarum. instit. de rer. diuis._ et Ouide descriuant\r\nl’excellence de l’Homme parle de la sorte,\r\n\r\n  _Pronaque, cum spectent animalia cæetera terras\r\n  Os homini sublime dedit, cælumque tueri\r\n  Iussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus._\r\n\r\net vn autre Poëte,\r\n\r\n  _Nonne vides hominem, vt Celsos ad sidera vultus\r\n  Sustulerit Deus, ac sublimia finxerit ora.\r\n  Cum pecudes, volucrumque genus, formasque ferarum,\r\n  Segnem, atque obscænam, passuri strauisset in aluum._\r\n\r\nPicus Mirandulanus, en vne de ses Oraison parlant de la grandeur de\r\nl’Homme dit _hominem tantœ excellentiae, ac sublimitatis esse, vt in se\r\nomnia continere dicatur, vti Deus, sed diuersimodè, Deus enim omnia in se\r\ncontinet, vti omnium medium principium, homo verò, in se omnia continet,\r\nvti omnium medium, quo fit, vt in Deo sint omnia meliore nota, quàm in\r\nseipsis, in homine inferiora nobiliori sint conditione, superiora autem\r\ndegenerent sicut aër, ignis, aqua et terra per verissimam proprietatem\r\nnaturœ suœ, in crasso hoc, et terreno, hominis corpore, quo nos videmus,\r\nhinc etenim nulla creata substantia seruire dedignatur, hinc Terra, et\r\nElementa, huic bruta præesto sunt, famulantur, hinc militat cælum, hinc\r\nsalutem bonumque procurant Angelicœ mentes_.\r\n\r\nEt se seroit vne chose, si j’ose dire hors de raison, que celuy pour qui\r\nla terre produit tous ces fruits, en fut priué, et que de chétifs animaux,\r\nprissent leur norriture, à l’exclusion de l’Homme pour qui ils sont\r\ndestinés de Dieu. C’est sur ce sujet qu’il dit _Increpabo pro te locustas\r\ndummodò posueris de fructibus tuis in horrea mea_.\r\n\r\nEt pour responce à ce qu’escrit S. Thomas qu’il n’est loisible de maudire\r\ntels animaux, si on les considere en eux mesmes, on dit qu’en l’espece\r\nqu’on traitte, on ne les considere pas, comme animaux simplement: mais\r\ncomme apportans du mal aux Hommes, mangeans et détruisans les fruits qui\r\nseruent à son soutient, et nourriture.\r\n\r\nMais à quoy, nous arrestons-nous depuis qu’on voit par des exemples\r\ninfinis que quantité de saints Personnages, ont Excommunié des animaux\r\napportans du dommage aux Hommes. Il suffira d’en rapporter vn pour tout,\r\nqui nous est cogneu, et familier, que nous voyons continuellement, à\r\nsçauoir dans la ville d’Aix, où S. Hugon Euesque de Grenoble Excommuniat\r\nles serpens, qui y estaient en quantité à cause des bains chauds de\r\nsouffre, et d’Alun, qui faisaient vn grand dommage aux Habitans de ce lieu\r\npar leur piqueures. De sorte que maintenant si bien les Serpens piquent,\r\nquelqu’vn dans le lieu, et confins: Telle piqueure ne fait aucun mal, le\r\nvenin de ces bestes estant arresté, par le moyen de telle Excommunication,\r\nque si quelqu’vn est piqué hors de ce lieu par les mesmes Serpens, la\r\npiqueure sera venimeuse et mortelle ainsi qu’on a veu par plusieurs fois.\r\nIe laisse à part quantité de passages de l’Escripture par lesquels on voit\r\nque Dieu a donné des maledictions aux choses inanimées, et Creatures sans\r\nraison, ainsi qu’on pourra voir au _Leuitic. Ch. 26. et Deutheronome 27.\r\nGenes. 2._ il maudit le Serpent _Maledictus es, inter omnia animantia, et\r\nbestias Terræ_.\r\n\r\nDe dire, qu’excommuniant, Anathematisant tels animaux, s’est s’en prendre\r\nà Dieu, qui les a enuoye pour le chastiment des hommes. A cela on respond\r\nque ce n’est pas s’ens prendre à Dieu que de recourir à l’Eglise, et la\r\nprier de diuertir, et chasser le mal, qu’il a pleu à sa Diuine Majesté de\r\nnous enuoyer, à cause de nos fautes et pechés; au contraire c’est vn acte\r\nde Religion que de recourir à elle, lors q’on voit que Dieu leue sa main\r\npour nous frapper.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion du Procureur Episcopal_\r\n\r\nLes defenses rapportées par l’Aduocat de ces animaux, contre les\r\nConclusions prises par les Habitans sont considerables qui meritent qu’on\r\nles examine meurement; car il ne faut pas ietter le carreau\r\nd’Excommunication à la volée, et sans sujet, estant vn foudre qui est si\r\nagissant, que s’il ne frappe celuy contre lequel on le jette, il embrase\r\nceluy qui le lance. Le discours de cét Aduocat est appuyé sur la règle de\r\nDroict, qui dit, _qui iussu iudicis aliquid facit, pœnam non meretur_, et\r\nvrayement c’est le Iuge des Iuges, qui ne laisse rien d’impuny, et qui\r\ndistribue les peines à l’égal des offences, sans auoir égard à personne,\r\nde qui les jugemens nous sont incognus, _quàm abscondita iudicia Dei,\r\ninuestigabiles viæ ejus_. C’est vne Mer profonde d’ont on ne peut\r\ndécouurir le fonds. De dire pourquoy il a enuoyé ces animaux, qui mangent\r\nles fruits de la terre: Ce nous sont lettres closes; peut estre veut-il\r\npunir ce Peuple, pour auoir fait la sourde oreille aux pauures qui\r\ndemandoient à leurs portes, estant vn Arrest infaillible, que qui fait aux\r\npauures la sourde oreille, attende de Dieu la pareille.\r\n\r\nCeux qui donnent l’aumosne sont toûjours sous la protection Diuine, aussi\r\nS. Gierosme dit _non memini me legisse mala morte mortuum, qui libenter\r\nopera charitatis exercuit, habet enim multos intercessores, et impossibile\r\nest, multorum preces non exaudiri_, et S. Ambrojse parlant de ceux qui\r\ndonnent l’aumône aux pauures, _si non pauisti necasti, pascendò seruare\r\npoteras_, de mesmes la Loy _de lib. agnoscend._ repute pour homicide celuy\r\nqui denie, et refuse les alimens à ceux qui en ont besoin, et le Prophete\r\nEzechiel, c. 18. parlant de la recompense, que Dieu a destinée à ceux qui\r\nfont du bien aux pauures, _qui panem suum esurienti dederit et nudum\r\noperuerit vestimento, justus est, et vità viuet_; Lesquelles paroles\r\nEusèbe expliche de la sorte, _fregisti esurienti panem tuum, in Coelo\r\nvitae pane qui Christus est satiaberis, hic peregrinis domus tua patuit,\r\nin domo Angelorum, Ciuis efficieris tu hic trementia membra destijsti,\r\nillic liberaberis ab illo frigore, in quo erit fletus, et stridor\r\ndentium_.\r\n\r\nC’est vn acte de Charité, que d’assister le pauures, _frange esurienti\r\npanem tuum et egenos, vagosque indue in domum tuam, cum videris nudum,\r\noperi eum, et carnem tuam ne despexeri_, dit Iosuë c. 38. aussi la\r\nrécompense est asseurée, ainsi qu’escrit S. Mathieu cap. 25. _venite\r\nBenedicti patris mei, possidete paratum vobis regnum à constitutione\r\nmundi; esuriui enim, et dedistis mihi manducare; sitiui, et dedistis mihi\r\nbibere; hospes eram et Collegistis me; nudus eram, et operuistis me, amen\r\ndico vobis quod vni fecistis ex fratribus meis minimis, mihi fecistis_.\r\nC’est vne œuure de Misericorde d’auuoir compassion de son prochain, ainsi\r\nque dit S. Ambroise _lib. 2. off. cap. 28. hoc maximum Misericordiæ, vt\r\ncompatiamur alienis calamitatibus necessitates aliorum, quantum possumus\r\niuvemus, et plus interdum quàm possumus_ l’Hospitalité est recommandée par\r\nS. Paul _hospitalitatem nolite obliuisci, per hanc enim placuerunt quidam,\r\nAngelis hospitio receptis_, et S. Augustin _disce Christiane sine\r\ndiscretione exhibere hospitalitatem, ne fortè cui domum clauseris, cui\r\nhumanitatem negaueris ipse sit Christus_. L’ordinaire recompence qui suit\r\nl’aumosne est le centuple, _honora Dominum de tua substantia, et de\r\nprimitiis omnium fructuorum tuorum de pauperibus, et implebuntur horrea\r\ntua saturitate et vino torcularia tua redundabunt_. Les abismes de la\r\nDiuinité ne s’épuisent jamais, pour donner, et le sage Salomon, _fæneratur\r\nDomino qui miseretur pauperi, et vicissitudinem suam reddet_. S. Paul aux\r\nCorinthièns Chap. 2. parle de la sorte, _qui administrat semen seminanti,\r\net panem ad manducandum præstabit, et multiplicabit semen suum_.\r\n\r\nSeroit-ce point à cause des irreuerences qu’on commet aux Eglises pendant\r\nle service Diuin, ou sans aucun égard à la presence de Dieu, _conduntur\r\nstupra, tractantur lenocinia, adulteria meditantur, frequentiùs deniquè;\r\nin ædituorum cellulis quòd in ipsis lupanaribus flagrans libido\r\ndefungitur_, pour parler auec Tertullien; car c’est là bien souuent où se\r\ndonne le mot, où se prennent les assignations, où se lancent les\r\nmeschantes œilliades, _Impudicus oculus, impudici cordis est nuncius_, dit\r\nS. Augustin. Sur tous les arbres et plantes, qui estaient en Ægypte, le\r\npéché était consacré à Harpocrates qui prenait soin du langage qu’on\r\ndeuait tenir aux Dieux, parce que le fruit du peché ressemble au cœur, et\r\nla feuille à la langue, inférant de là que ceux qui allaient aux Temples,\r\ndeuoient penser saintement honestement, et sombrement parler.\r\n\r\nNuma Pompilius ne volut pas qu’on assistât au culte Diuin par maniere\r\nd’aquit: Mais qu’en quittant toutes choses, on y employat entièrement sa\r\npensée, comme au principal acte de la Religion, et d’actions enuers les\r\nDieux, ne voulant pas mesme pendant le Seruice, qu’on entendit parmy les\r\nRuës aucun bruit, et lors que les Prestres faisoient le Sacrifices et\r\nceremonies, il y auoit des Sergens qui crioent au Peuple que l’on se tue,\r\nlaissant toute autre œuvre pour estre attentif au Culte.\r\n\r\nQue si les Payens ont esté si exats en leur fausse Religion au Culte de\r\nleurs Idoles, et imaginaires Diuinités, nous qui sommes Chrestiens, et\r\nauons la conoissance du vray Dieu; quel respect ne luy deuons-nous pas\r\nporter dans les Eglises, pendant le S. Sacrifice de la Messe et autres\r\nOffices Diuins.\r\n\r\nMais si bien Dieu est Iuste iusticier, qui ne laisse rien impuni\r\ntoutesfois la Iustice ne tient pas si fort le haut bout, que la\r\nmisericorde, n’y treuue place. Il est autant Misericordieux que Iuste, et\r\ns’il enuoit quelques aduersités aux pecheurs et les visite par quelque\r\ncoup de fouët: C’est pour les aduertir de faire penitence, par le moyen\r\nde laquelle ils puissent détourner son courroux, et iuste vengeance, et\r\npar ce moyen, ils se puissent reconcilier auec luy, et obtenir ses graces,\r\net pardon de leurs fautes et pechés.\r\n\r\nNous voyons ces habitans la larme à l’œil, qui demandent pardon d’vn cœur\r\ncontrit de leurs fautes, ayans horreur des crimes commis par le passé, et\r\nemployent l’assistance de l’Eglise pour les soulager en leurs nécessités,\r\net détourner le Carreau qui leur pend sur la teste, estans menacés d’vne\r\nfamine insuportable si vous ne prenés leur droit, et cause en protection,\r\net faire déloger ces animaux, qui les menaçent d’vne ruine totale, à quoy\r\nnous n’empeschons.\r\n\r\nConcluans à cét effect, qu’il plaise de rendre vostre Sentence d’execution\r\ncontre ces animaux, afin que d’ores en auant ils n’apportent du dommage\r\naux fruits de la terre enjoignans aux Habitans, les Penitences, et\r\nOraisons, à ce conuenables et accoustumées.\r\n\r\n_La Sentence du Iuge d’Eglise_\r\n\r\nIn nomine Domini amen, visa supplicatione pro parte habitantium loci,\r\nnobis officiali in iudicio facta, aduersus Bronchos, seu Erucas, vel alia\r\nnon dissimilia animalia fructus vinearum eiusdem loci à certis annis, et\r\nadhuc hoc praesenti anno, vt fide dignorum Testimonio, et quasi publico\r\nRumore asseritur, cum maximo incolarum loci, et vicinorum locorum\r\nincommodo depopulantia, vt praedicta animalia per nos moneantur, et\r\nremediis Ecclesiasticis mediantibus compellantur, à territorio dicti loci\r\nabire, visisque diligenter, inspectis causis praedictae supplicationis,\r\nnecnon pro parte, dictarum Erucarum, seu animalium, per certos\r\nConciliarios eosdem, per nos deputatos, propositis et allegatis, audito\r\netiam super praemissis promotore, ac visâ certâ informatione, et\r\nordinatione nostra, per certum dictae Curiae, Notarium, de damno in\r\nvineis, iam dicti loci, per animalia illato.

In the Middle Ages,\r\nand even as late as the end of the eighteenth century, the orthography of\r\nproper names was very uncertain.\r\n\r\n[2] “Item: a été délibéré que la ville se joindra aux paroisses de cette\r\nprovince qui voudront obtenir de Rome une excommunication contre les\r\ninsects et que l’on contribuera aux frais au pro rata.”\r\n\r\n[3] These animals are spoken of as _unvernünftige Thierlein genannt\r\nLutmäuse_. _Lut_ might be derived from the Old German _lût_ (_Laut_,\r\nSchrei), in which case _Lutmaus_ would mean shrew-mouse; but it is more\r\nprobably from _lutum_ (loam, mould), and signifies mole or field-mouse.\r\nField-mice are exceedingly prolific rodents, and in modern as well as in\r\nmediæval times have often done grievous harm to husbandry and\r\narboriculture by consuming roots and fruits and gnawing the bark of young\r\ntrees. The recklessness of hunters in exterminating foxes, hedgehogs,\r\npolecats, weasels, buzzards, crows, kites, owls and similar beasts and\r\nbirds, which are destructive of field-mice, has frequently caused the\r\nlatter to multiply so as to become a terrible plague. This was the case in\r\nEngland in 1813-14, and in Germany in 1822, and again in 1856.\r\n\r\n[4] The first part of this treatise, consisting of seventeen chapters,\r\ndiscusses the different kinds of “monitoires” and their applications. Only\r\nthe second part, describing the legal procedure, is here printed.\r\n\r\n[5] A few early instances of excommunication and malediction, our\r\nknowledge of which is derived chiefly from hagiologies and other legendary\r\nsources, are not included in the present list, such, for example, as the\r\ncursing and burning of storks at Avignon by St. Agricola in 666, and the\r\nexpulsion of venomous reptiles from the island Reichenau in 728 by Saint\r\nPerminius.\r\n\r\n[6] This case is probably identical with and an adjournment of that of\r\n1478.\r\n\r\n[7] Identical with the sentences covering the period of 1500-1530.\r\n\r\n[8] In this latest record of such prosecutions a man named Marger was\r\nkilled and robbed by Scherrer and his son, with the fierce and effective\r\nco-operation of their dog. The three murderers were tried and the two men\r\nsentenced to lifelong imprisonment, but the dog, as the chief culprit,\r\nwithout whose complicity the crime could not have been committed, was\r\ncondemned to death.\r\n\r\n[9] In modern French _pendard_ means hang-dog. M. Lejeune states that he\r\ncan recall no other instance of its use as synonymous with bourreau or\r\nhangman. Perhaps a facetious clerk may have deemed it applicable to a\r\nperson whose office was in the present case that of a hang-pig.\r\n\r\n[10] Under this term are included the dean, canons, and chapter of the\r\nCathedral of Chartres.\r\n\r\n[11] _Mietkuhe_, a cow pastured or wintered for pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nPassages in italics are indicated by _italics_.\r\n\r\nSuperscripted characters are indicated by {superscript}.",
