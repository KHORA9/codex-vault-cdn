One of the speakers dwelt largely upon the sins\r\nof the fathers. He drew stern pictures of the vice, the barbarism, the\r\nheathenism of the \"good old times,\" and ended by saying with emphasis\r\nthat he felt himself \"_bowed down beneath the burden of the sins of his\r\nancestors_.\"\r\n\r\nOur mother was on her feet in a flash.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. So-and-So,\" she said, \"is bowed down by the sins of his ancestors.\r\nI wish to say that all my life I have been buoyed up and lifted on by\r\nthe remembrance of the virtues of mine!\"\r\n\r\nThese words are so characteristic of her, that in beginning the story of\r\nher life it seems proper to dwell at some length on the ancestors whose\r\nmemory she cherished with such reverence.\r\n\r\nThe name of Ward occurs first on the roll of Battle Abbey: \"Seven\r\nhundred and ten distinguished persons\" accompanied William of Normandy\r\nto England, among them \"Ward, one of the noble captains.\"\r\n\r\nHer first known ancestor, John Ward, of Gloucester, England, sometime\r\ncavalry officer in Cromwell's army, came to this country after the\r\nRestoration and settled at Newport in Rhode Island. His son Thomas\r\nmarried Amy Smith, a granddaughter of Roger Williams. Thomas's son\r\nRichard became Governor of Rhode Island and had fourteen children, among\r\nthem Samuel, who in turn became Governor of the Colony, and a member of\r\nthe Continental Congress. He was the only Colonial governor who refused\r\nto take the oath to enforce the Stamp Act. In 1775, in the Continental\r\nCongress, he was made Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, which from\r\n1774 to 1776 sat daily, working without intermission in the cause of\r\nindependence. But though one of the framers of the \"Declaration,\" he was\r\nnot destined to be a \"signer.\" John Adams says of him, \"When he was\r\nseized with the smallpox he said that if his vote and voice were\r\nnecessary to support the cause of his country, he should live; if not,\r\nhe should die. He died, and the cause of his country was supported, but\r\nit lost one of its most sincere and punctual advocates.\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between Governor Ward and General Washington has been\r\npreserved. In one letter the latter says: \"I think, should occasion\r\noffer, I shall be able to give you a good account of your son, as he\r\nseems a sensible, well-informed young man.\"\r\n\r\nThis young man was Samuel Ward, Lieutenant-Colonel of the First Rhode\r\nIsland Regiment, and our mother's grandfather.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] Born 1756, died 1832. He graduated in 1771 from Rhode Island\r\n  College (now Brown University) with distinguished honors.\r\n\r\nIn Trumbull's painting of the Attack on Quebec in 1776, there is a\r\nportrait of Lieutenant-Colonel Ward, a young, active figure with sword\r\nuplifted. His life was full of stirring incident. In 1775 he received\r\nhis commission as Captain, and was one of two hundred and fifty of the\r\nRhode Island troops who volunteered to join Benedict Arnold's command of\r\neleven hundred men, ordered to advance by way of the Kennebec River to\r\nreinforce General Montgomery at Quebec. In a letter to his family, dated\r\nPoint-aux-Trembles, November 26, 1775, Captain Ward says: \"We were\r\nthirty days in the wilderness, that none but savages ever attempted to\r\npass. We marched a hundred miles upon shore with only three days'\r\nprovisions, waded over three rapid rivers, marched through snow and ice\r\nbarefoot, passed over the St. Lawrence where it was guarded by the\r\nenemy's frigates, and are now resting about twenty-four miles from the\r\ncity to recruit our worn-out natures. General Montgomery intends to join\r\nus immediately, so that we have a winter's campaign before us. But I\r\ntrust we shall have the glory of taking Quebec!\"\r\n\r\nThe young soldier's hopes were vain. He was taken prisoner with many of\r\nhis men while gallantly defending a difficult position, and spent a year\r\nin prison. On his release he rejoined the army of Washington and fought\r\nthrough the greater part of the Revolution, rising to the rank of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel. He was at Peekskill, Valley Forge, and Red Bank, and\r\nwrote the official account of the last-named battle, which may be found\r\nin Washington's correspondence.\r\n\r\nDuring the terrible winter at Valley Forge, Lieutenant-Colonel Ward\r\nobtained a month's furlough, wooed and married his cousin, Phoebe\r\nGreene (daughter of Governor William Greene, of Rhode Island, and of the\r\nbeautiful Catherine Ray,[2] of Block Island), and returned to the snows\r\nand starvation of the winter camp. Our mother was very proud of her\r\ngreat-grandmother Catherine's memory, treasured her rat-tail spoons and\r\nher wedding stockings of orange silk, and was fond of telling how\r\nBenjamin Franklin admired and corresponded with her. Some of Franklin's\r\nletters have been preserved. He speaks of his wife as the \"old lady,\"\r\nbut says he has got so used to her faults that they are like his own--he\r\ndoes not recognize them any more. In one letter he gives the following\r\nadvice to the lovely Catherine: \"Kill no more Pigeons than you can eat.\r\nGo constantly to meeting or to church--till you get a good husband; then\r\nstay at home and nurse the children and live like a Christian.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] Granddaughter of Simon Ray, one of the original owners of the\r\n  island. He was \"pressed in a cheese-press\" on account of his\r\n  religious opinions.\r\n\r\nSome years after the Revolution, Colonel Ward was in Paris on a business\r\nerrand. He kept a record of his stay there in a parchment pocket-book,\r\nwhere among technical entries are found brief comments on matters of\r\ngeneral interest. One day the Colonel tells of a dinner party where he\r\nmet Vergniaud and other prominent revolutionists. He was surprised to\r\nfind them such plain men; \"yet were they exceeding warm.\" On December\r\n29,1792, he notes: \"Dined with Gouverneur Morris. Served upon\r\nplate--good wines--his Kitchen neither french or English, but between\r\nboth. Servants french, apartments good.... I have visited the halls of\r\npainting and sculpture at the Louvre. The peices [sic] are all called\r\n_chef d'oeuvres_ by connoisseurs. The oldest are thought the best, I\r\ncannot tell why, though some of the old peices are very good. Milo\r\nriving the oak is good....\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the theatre, and observed that the features which appeared to\r\nhim most objectionable were specially applauded by the audience.\r\n\r\nBriefly, amid items of the sale of land, he thus notes the execution of\r\nLouis XVI:--\r\n\r\n\"January 15th. The convention has this day decided upon two questions on\r\nthe King; one that he was guilty, another that the question should not\r\nbe sent to the people.\r\n\r\n\"January 17th. The convention up all night upon the question of the\r\nKing's sentence. At eleven this night the question was determined--the\r\nsentence of death was pronounced. 366 death--319 seclusion or\r\nbanishment--36 various--majority of 5 absolute--the King caused an\r\nappeal to be made to the people, which was not allowed; thus the\r\nconvention have been the accusers, the judges, and will be the executors\r\nof their own sentence--this will cause a great degree of astonishment in\r\nAmerica....\r\n\r\n\"January 21st. Went to the Pont Royal to pass it at nine o'clock. Guards\r\nprevented me from going over. I had engaged to pass this day, which is\r\none of horror, at Versailles, with Mr. Morris. The King was beheaded at\r\neleven o'clock. Guards, at an early hour, took possession of the _Place\r\nLouis XV_, and were posted in each avenue. The most profound peace\r\nprevailed. Those who had feeling lamented in secret in their houses, or\r\nhad left town. Others showed the same levity or barbarous indifference\r\nas on former occasions. Hichborn, Henderson, and Johnson went to see the\r\nexecution, for which, as an American, I was sorry. The King desired to\r\nspeak. He had only time to say he was innocent, and forgave his enemies.\r\nHe behaved with the fortitude of a martyr. Santerre ordered the\r\n[executioner] to dispatch him. At twelve the streets were again all\r\nopen.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that when Colonel Ward quitted Paris, with a party\r\nof friends, the carriage was driven by a disguised nobleman, who thus\r\nescaped the guillotine.\r\n\r\nOur mother remembered him as a \"gentleman advanced in years, with\r\ncourtly manner and mild blue eyes, which were, in spite of their\r\nmildness, very observing.\"\r\n\r\nShe inherited many traits from the Wards, among them a force and\r\nintegrity of purpose, a strength of character, and a certain business\r\ninstinct which sometimes cropped up when least expected, and which\r\ncaused some of her family to call her the \"banker's daughter.\"\r\n\r\nThose were also solid qualities which she inherited from the Rhode\r\nIsland Greenes. Greenes of Warwick, Greenes of East Greenwich; all\r\nthrough Colonial and Revolutionary history we find their names. Sturdy,\r\nactive, patriotic men: Generals, Colonels, and Governors of \"Rhode\r\nIsland and Providence Plantations,\" chief among them Governor William\r\nGreene, the \"War Governor,\" and General Nathanael Greene of glorious\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nOur liveliest association with the name of Greene is the memory of Mrs.\r\nNancy Greene, first cousin of our grandfather Ward and daughter-in-law\r\nof the General who died in Middletown, Rhode Island, in 1886, at the age\r\nof one hundred and two. This lady was dear to our mother as the one\r\nremaining link with her father's generation. A visit to \"Cousin Nancy\"\r\nwas one of her great pleasures, and we children were happy if we were\r\nallowed to accompany her. The old lady sat erect and dignified in her\r\nstraight-backed chair, and the two discoursed at length of days gone by.\r\nTo Cousin Nancy \"Julia\" was always young, though the \"Battle Hymn of the\r\nRepublic\" was already written when the old lady charged her to\r\n\"cultivate a literary taste.\" On another occasion--it was one of the\r\nlater visits--she said with emphasis, \"Julia, do not allow yourself to\r\ngrow old! When you feel that you _cannot_ do a thing, _get up and do\r\nit!_\" Julia never forgot this advice.\r\n\r\nCousin Nancy never read a novel in her life, as she announced with\r\npride. She wished to read the \"Annals of the Schönberg-Cotta Family,\"\r\nbut, finding it to be a work of fiction, decided not to break her rule.\r\nShe was a fond and pious mother; when her son needed chastisement, she\r\nwould pray over him so long that he would cry out, \"Mother, it is time\r\nto begin whipping!\"\r\n\r\nIf Julia Ward was part Ward and Greene, she was quite as much Cutler and\r\nMarion; it is to this descent that we must turn for the best explanation\r\nof her many-sided character.\r\n\r\nWhen she said of any relation, however distant, \"He is a Cutler!\" it\r\nmeant that she recognized in that person certain qualities--a warmth of\r\ntemperament, a personality glowing, sparkling, effervescent--akin to her\r\nown. If in addition to these qualities the person had red hair, she took\r\nhim to her heart, and he could do no wrong. All this, and a host of\r\ntender associations beside, the name of Cutler meant to her; yet it may\r\nbe questioned whether any of these characteristics would have appeared\r\nin the descendants of Johannes Demesmaker, worthy citizen of Holland,\r\nwho, coming to this country in 1674, changed his name to Cutler for\r\nconvenience' sake, had not one of these descendants, Benjamin Clarke\r\nCutler, married Sarah (Mitchell) Hyrne, daughter of Thomas Mitchell and\r\nEsther (or Hester) Marion.\r\n\r\nTo most people, the name of Marion suggests one person only,--General\r\nFrancis Marion of Revolutionary fame; yet it was the grandfather of the\r\nGeneral, Benjamin Marion, of La Rochelle, who was the first of the name\r\nto settle in this country, coming hither when the Revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes drove the Huguenots into exile. Brigadier-General Peter\r\nHorry,[3] friend and biographer of General Marion, quotes the letter\r\nwhich told Benjamin of his banishment:--\r\n\r\n\r\nYour damnable heresy well deserves, even in this life, that purgation by\r\nfire which awfully awaits it in the next. But in consideration of your\r\nyouth and worthy connections, our mercy has condescended to commute your\r\npunishment to perpetual exile. You will, therefore, instantly prepare to\r\nquit your country forever, for, if after ten days from the date hereof,\r\nyou should be found in any part of the kingdom, your miserable body\r\nshall be consumed by fire and your impious ashes scattered on the winds\r\nof heaven.\r\n\r\n         (Signed)\r\n                                                   PÈRE ROCHELLE.\r\n\r\n  [3] See Horry and Weems, _Life of Marion_. General Horry was a most\r\n  zealous and devoted friend; as a biographer his accuracy is\r\n  questionable, his picturesqueness never.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the ten days Benjamin Marion had wound up his affairs, married\r\nhis betrothed, Judith Baluet, and was on his way to America to seek his\r\nfortune. He bought a plantation on Goose Creek, near Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, and here he and his Judith lived for many peaceful years in\r\ncontent and prosperity, seeing their children grow up around them.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] We have not found the date of his death, but Horry gives the\r\n  principal features of his will as he got them from the family. He calls\r\n  Judith Marion \"Louisa,\" but that is his picturesque way. She may have\r\n  been \"Judith Louisa\"! Women's names were not of much consequence in\r\n  those days.\r\n\r\n\"After having, in the good old way, bequeathed 'his soul to God who gave\r\nit,' and 'his body to the earth out of which it was taken,' he\r\nproceeds:--\r\n\r\n\"'In the first place, as to debts, thank God, I owe none, and therefore\r\nshall give my executors but little trouble on that score.\r\n\r\n\"'Secondly,--As to the poor, I have always treated them as my brethren.\r\nMy dear family will, I know, follow my example.\r\n\r\n\"'Thirdly,--As to the wealth with which God has been pleased to bless me\r\nand my dear Louisa and children, lovingly have we labored together for\r\nit--lovingly we have enjoyed it--and now, with a glad and grateful heart\r\ndo I leave it among them.\r\n\r\n\"'I give my beloved Louisa all my ready money--that she may never be\r\nalarmed at a sudden call.\r\n\r\n\"'I give her all my fat calves and lambs, my pigs and poultry--that she\r\nmay always keep a good table.\r\n\r\n\"'I give her my new carriage and horses--that she may visit her friends\r\nin comfort.\r\n\r\n\"'I give her my family Bible--that she may live above the ill-tempers\r\nand sorrows of life.\r\n\r\n\"'I give my son Peter a hornbook--for I am afraid he will always be a\r\ndunce.'\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Horry goes on to say that Peter was so stunned by this squib\r\nthat he \"instantly quit his raccoon hunting by night and betook himself\r\nto reading, and soon became a very sensible and charming young man.\"\r\n\r\nGabriel Marion, the eldest son of Benjamin, married a young woman, also\r\nof Huguenot blood, Charlotte Cordés or Corday, said to have been a\r\nrelative of the other Charlotte Corday, the heroine of the French\r\nRevolution. To this couple were born six children, the eldest being\r\nEsther, our mother's great-grandmother, the youngest, Francis, who was\r\nto become the \"Swamp Fox\" of Revolutionary days.\r\n\r\nEsther Marion has been called the \"Queen Bee\" of the Marion hive; she\r\nhad fifteen children, and her descendants have multiplied and spread in\r\nevery direction. She was twice married, first to John Allston, of\r\nGeorgetown, or Waccamaw, secondly to Thomas Mitchell, of Georgetown. The\r\nonly one of the fifteen children with whom we have concern is Sarah\r\nMitchell, the \"Grandma Cutler\" of Julia Ward's childhood. This lady was\r\nmarried at fourteen to Dr. Hyrne, an officer of Washington's army. Julia\r\nwell remembered her saying that after her engagement, she wept on being\r\ntold that she must give up her dolls.\r\n\r\nDr. Hyrne lived but a short time, and four years after his death the\r\ntwenty-year-old widow married Benjamin Clarke Cutler, then a widower,\r\nSheriff of Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and third in descent from John\r\nDemesmaker,[5] before mentioned, sometime physician and surgeon.\r\n\r\n  [5] On first coming to this country, Johannes Demesmaker settled in\r\n  Hingham, Massachusetts. Later he moved to Boston, where he became known\r\n  as Dr. John Cutler; married Mary Cowell, of Boston, and served as\r\n  surgeon in King Philip's War.\r\n\r\nOur mother was much attached to \"Grandma Cutler,\" and speaks thus of her\r\nin a sketch entitled \"The Elegant Literature of Sixty Years Ago\":\r\n\"Grandma will read Owen Feltham's 'Resolves,' albeit the print is too\r\nsmall for her eyes. She knows Pope and Crabbe by heart, admires\r\nShenstone, and tells me which scenes are considered finest in this or\r\nthat of Scott's novels. Calling one day upon a compeer of her own age,\r\nshe was scandalized to find her occupied with a silly story called\r\n'Jimmy Jessamy.'\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cutler had known General Washington, and was fond of telling how at\r\na ball the Commander-in-Chief crossed the room to speak to her. Many of\r\nher letters have been preserved, and show a sprightliness which is well\r\nborne out by her portrait, that of a charming old lady in a turban, with\r\nbright eyes and a humorous mouth.\r\n\r\nA word remains to be said about General Francis Marion himself. This\r\nhero of history, song, and romance was childless; our mother could claim\r\nas near relationship to him as could any of her generation. She was\r\nextremely proud of this kinship, and no one who knew her could doubt\r\nthat from the Marions she inherited many vital qualities. One winter,\r\ntoward the end of her life, there was a meeting at the Old South Church\r\nat which--as at the gathering described at the beginning of this\r\nchapter--there was talk of ancestry and kindred topics. The weather was\r\nstormy, our mother well on in the eighties, but she was there. Being\r\ncalled on to speak, she made a brief address in the course of which she\r\nalluded to her Southern descent, and to General Francis Marion, her\r\ngreat-great-uncle. As she spoke her eyes lightened with mirth, in the\r\nway we all remember: \"General Marion,\" she said, \"was known in his\r\ngeneration as the 'Swamp Fox'; and when I succeed in eluding the care of\r\nmy guardians, children and grandchildren, and coming to a meeting like\r\nthis, I think I may be said to have inherited some of his\r\ncharacteristics!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLITTLE JULIA WARD\r\n\r\n1819-1835; _aet._ 1-16\r\n\r\nFROM MY NURSERY: FORTY-SIX YEARS AGO\r\n\r\n  When I was a little child,\r\n  Said my passionate nurse, and wild:\r\n  \"Wash you, children, clean and white;\r\n  God may call you any night.\"\r\n\r\n  Close my tender brother clung,\r\n  While I said with doubtful tongue:\r\n  \"No, we cannot die so soon;\r\n  For you told, the other noon,\r\n\r\n  \"Of those months in order fine\r\n  That should make the earth divine.\r\n  I've not seen, scarce five years old,\r\n  Months like those of which you told.\"\r\n\r\n  Softly, then, the woman's hand\r\n  Loosed my frock from silken band,\r\n  Tender smoothed the fiery head,\r\n  Often shamed for ringlets red.\r\n  Somewhat gently did she say,\r\n  \"Child, those months are every day.\"\r\n\r\n  Still, methinks, I wait in fear,\r\n  For that wonder-glorious year--\r\n  For a spring without a storm,\r\n  Summer honey-dewed and warm,\r\n  Autumn of robuster strength,\r\n  Winter piled in crystal length.\r\n\r\n  I will wash me clean and white;\r\n  God may call me any night.\r\n  I must tell Him when I go\r\n  His great year is yet to know--\r\n  Year when working of the race\r\n  Shall match Creation's dial face;\r\n  Each hour be born of music's chime,\r\n  And Truth eternal told in Time.\r\n\r\n                                        J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Ward had ten children, of whom seven lived to grow\r\nup. The fifth child and son was Samuel, our mother's father, born in\r\nWarwick, Rhode Island, May 1, 1786. When he was four years old, the\r\nfamily moved to New York, where the Colonel and his brother established\r\nthemselves as merchants under the firm name of Samuel Ward & Brother.\r\n\r\nThe firm was only moderately successful; the children came fast. With\r\nhis narrow income it was not possible for the father to give his boy the\r\ncollege education he desired; so at fourteen, fresh from the common\r\nschools, Samuel entered as a clerk the banking house of Prime & King.\r\nWhile still a mere lad, an old friend of the family asked him what he\r\nmeant to be when he came to man's estate.\r\n\r\n\"I mean to be one of the first bankers in the United States!\" replied\r\nSamuel.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-two he became a partner in the firm, which was\r\nthereafter known as Prime, Ward & King.\r\n\r\nIn a memoir of our grandfather, the partner who survived him, Mr.\r\nCharles King, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Money was the commodity in which Mr. Ward dealt, and if, as is hardly\r\nto be disputed, money be the root of all evil, it is also, in hands that\r\nknow how to use it worthily, the instrument of much good. There exist\r\nundoubtedly, in regard to the trade in money, and respecting those\r\nengaged in it, many and absurd prejudices, inherited in part from\r\nancient error, and fomented and kept alive by the jealousies of\r\nignorance and indigence. It is therefore no small triumph to have lived\r\ndown, as Mr. Ward did, this prejudice, and to have forced upon the\r\ncommunity in the midst of which he resided, and upon all brought into\r\nconnexion with him, the conviction that commerce in money, like commerce\r\nin general, is, to a lofty spirit, lofty and ennobling, and is valued\r\nmore for the power it confers, of promoting liberal and beneficent\r\nenterprises, and of conducing to the welfare and prosperity of society,\r\nthan for the means of individual and selfish gratification or\r\nindulgence.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ward's activities were not confined to financial affairs. He was\r\nfounder and first president of the Bank of Commerce; one of the founders\r\nof the New York University and of the Stuyvesant Institute, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 he married Julia Rush Cutler, second daughter of Benjamin Clarke\r\nand Sarah Mitchell (Hyrne) Cutler. Julia Cutler was sixteen years old at\r\nthe time of her marriage, lovely in character and beautiful in person.\r\nShe had been a pupil of the saintly Isabella Graham, and her literary\r\ntaste had been carefully cultivated in the style of the day. One of her\r\npoems, found in Griswold's \"Female Poets of America,\" shows the deeply\r\nreligious cast of her mind; yet she was full of gentle gayety, loved\r\nmusic, laughter, and pretty things.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of their married life, Mr. and Mrs. Ward lived in\r\nMarketfield Street, near the Battery. Here four children were born,\r\nSamuel and Henry, and the two Julias. She who was known as \"the first\r\nlittle Julia\" lived only four years. During her fatal illness her father\r\nwas called away by urgent business. In great distress of mind, he\r\narranged that certain tokens should inform him of the child's\r\ncondition. A few days later, as he was riding homeward, a messenger came\r\nto meet him and silently laid in his hand a tiny shoe: the child was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, on May 27, 1819, a second daughter was born, and\r\nnamed Julia.\r\n\r\nJulia Ward was very little when her parents moved to \"a large house on\r\nthe Bowling Green, a region of high fashion in those days.\"[6] Here were\r\nborn three more children: Francis Marion, Louisa Cutler, and Ann Eliza.\r\nFor some time before the birth of the last-named child, Mrs. Ward's\r\nhealth had been gradually failing, though every known measure had been\r\nused to restore it. There had been journeys to Niagara and up the\r\nHudson, in the family coach, straw-color outside with linings and\r\ncushions of brilliant blue. Little Julia went with her mother on these\r\njourneys; the good elder sister, Eliza Cutler, was also of the party;\r\nand a physician, Dr. John Wakefield Francis, who was later to play an\r\nimportant part in the family life. Julia remembered many incidents of\r\nthese journeys, though the latest of them took place when she was barely\r\nfour years old. She sat in a little chair placed at the feet of her\r\nelders, and she used to tell us how, cramped with remaining in one\r\nposition, she was constantly moving the chair, bringing its feet down on\r\nthose of Dr. Francis, to his acute anguish. In spite of this, the good\r\ndoctor would often read to her from a book of short tales and poems\r\nwhich had been brought for her amusement, and she always remembered his\r\nreading of \"Pity the sorrows of a poor old man,\" and how it brought the\r\ntears to her eyes.\r\n\r\n  [6] _Reminiscences_, p. 4.\r\n\r\nAt Niagara Falls she asked Dr. Francis, \"Who made that great hole where\r\nthe water came down?\" and was told \"The great Maker of all!\" This\r\npuzzled her, and she inquired further, but when her friend said, \"Do you\r\nnot know? Our Father who art in heaven!\" she \"felt that she ought to\r\nhave known, and went away somewhat abashed.\"[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] _Reminiscences_, p. 4.\r\n\r\nShe remembered a visit to Red Jacket, the famous Indian chief, at his\r\nencampment. Julia was given a twist of tobacco tied with blue ribbon,\r\nwhich she was to present to him. At sight of the tall, dignified savage,\r\nthe child sprang forward and threw her arms round his neck, to the great\r\ndiscomfiture of both; baby as she was, Julia felt at once that her\r\nembrace was unexpected and unwelcome.\r\n\r\nSometimes they went to the pleasant farm at Jamaica, Long Island, where\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Ward was living at this time, with his unmarried\r\nsons, and his two daughters, Phoebe and Anne.\r\n\r\nPhoebe was an invalid saint. She lived in a darkened room, and the\r\nplates and dishes from which she ate were of brown china or crockery, as\r\nshe fancied her eyes could not bear white. Anne was equally pious, but\r\nmore normal. She it was who managed the farm, and who would always bring\r\nthe cheeses to New York herself for the market, lest any of the family\r\ngrow proud and belittle the dignity of honest work.\r\n\r\nIt is from Jamaica that Mrs. Ward writes to her mother a letter which\r\nshows that though the tenderest of mothers, she had been strictly imbued\r\nwith the Old Testament ideas of bringing up children.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAREST MOTHER,-- ... I find myself better since I came hither....\r\nHusband _more devoted than ever_; children sweet tho' something of a\r\ndrawback on my recovery.... Thus in one page, you have the whole history\r\nof my present life, reading and thinking only excepted, which occupy by\r\nfar the greatest portion of my time.... I was obliged to whip Julia\r\nyesterday afternoon, and have been sick ever since in consequence of the\r\nagitation it threw me into.... I felt _obliged_ to try Solomon's\r\nprescription, which had a worse effect on me than on her.... I think it\r\nis the last time, however, blow high or low, for she is as nervous as\r\nher mama was at her age, at the sight of a rod, and screamed herself\r\nalmost to death; indeed her nerves were so affected that she cannot get\r\nover it and has cried all today, trembling as violently as if she had\r\nthe ague all the time I whipped her and could not eat.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulia was to retain through life the memories of the dear mother so\r\nearly lost. She remembered her first sewing-lesson; how being told to\r\ntake the needle in one hand she straightway placed the thimble on the\r\nother. She remembered her first efforts to say \"mother,\" and how\r\n\"muzzer\" was all she could produce, till \"the dear parent presently\r\nsaid, 'if you cannot do better than that, you will have to go back and\r\ncall me \"mamma.\"' The shame of going back moved me to one last effort,\r\nand, summoning my utmost strength of tongue I succeeded in saying\r\n'mother.'\"[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] _Reminiscences_, p. 8.\r\n\r\nAll devices to restore the young mother's failing strength were in vain:\r\nsoon after giving birth to the fourth daughter, Ann Eliza, she died.\r\n\r\nHer life had been pure, happy, and unselfish; yet her last hours were\r\nfull of anguish. Reared in the strictest tenets of Evangelical piety,\r\nshe was oppressed with terror concerning the fate of her soul; the\r\nsorrows of death compassed her about, the pains of hell gat hold upon\r\nher. It is piteous to read of the sufferings of this innocent creature,\r\nas described by her mourning family; piteous, too, to realize, by the\r\nlight of to-day, that she was almost literally _prayed to death_. She\r\nwas twenty-seven years old when she died and had borne seven children.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward's grief at the death of this beloved wife was so extreme as to\r\nbring on a severe illness. For some time he could not bear to see the\r\nchild who, he thought, had cost her mother's life; and though he\r\ngathered his other children tenderly around him, the little Annie was\r\nkept out of his sight.\r\n\r\nBy and by his father came to make him a visit and heard of this state of\r\nthings. Going to the nursery, the old gentleman took the baby from its\r\nnurse, and carrying it into the room where his son sat desolate, laid it\r\ngently in his arms. From that moment the little youngest became almost\r\nhis dearest care.\r\n\r\nHe could not live with his sorrow in the same dwelling that had\r\ncontained his joy. The beautiful house at Bowling Green was sold, with\r\nthe new furniture which had lately been ordered to please his Julia, and\r\nwhich the children never saw uncovered; and the family removed to Bond\r\nStreet, then at the upper end of New York City.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ward,\" said his friends, \"you are going out of town!\"\r\n\r\nBond Street in the twentieth century is an unlovely thoroughfare, grimy,\r\nfrowzy, given over largely to the sale of feathers and artificial\r\nflowers; Bond Street in the early part of the nineteenth century was a\r\ndifferent affair.\r\n\r\nThe first settler in the street was Jonas Minturn, who about 1825 built\r\nNo. 22. Mr. Ward came next. The city was then so remote, one could\r\nhardly see the houses to the south across the woods and fields.\r\n\r\nThe Ward children saw the street grow up around them; saw the dignified\r\nhouses, brick or freestone, built and occupied by Kings, Halls, Morgans,\r\nGrinnells, most of all by Wards. Mr. Ward was then at No. 16; his\r\nfather, the old Revolutionary soldier, soon came to live at No. 7, with\r\nhis daughter Anne; his brother Henry was first at No. 14, then at No.\r\n23; while his brother John was to make No. 8 a dwelling beloved by three\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nJulia did not remember in what year her father bought the tract of land\r\nat the corner of Bond Street and Broadway. At first a large part of it\r\nwas fenced in, and used as a riding-ring by the Ward boys. There was\r\nalso, either here or at No. 16, something in the way of a garden, which\r\nshe thus recalls in an address on horticulture, given in her later\r\nyears:--\r\n\r\n\"My earliest horticultural recollections go back to an enclosure,\r\nusually called a yard, in the rear of my father's house in New York.\r\nWhen my little brother and I were turned out to play there, we might\r\njust as well have picked the bugs off the rosebushes as the buds, of\r\nwhich we made wicked havoc. Not knowing what to do with the flower\r\nborder, we barbarized instead of cultivating it. Being of extremely\r\ninquiring minds, we picked the larkspurs and laburnums to pieces, but\r\nbecame nothing the wiser for the process. A little daily tuition might\r\nhave transformed us into a miniature Adam and Eve, and might have taught\r\nus some things that these old friends of ours did not know. But tuition\r\nto us then meant six or eight daily hours passed in dry conversation\r\nwith the family governess or French master. No one dreamed of turning\r\nthe enamelled pages of the garden for us. We grew up consequently with\r\nthe city measure of the universe--your own house, somebody else's, the\r\ntrees in the park, a strip of blue sky overhead, and a great deal of\r\ntalk about Nature read from the best authors. Much that is most\r\nbeautiful in the works of all the poets was perfectly unintelligible to\r\nus, because we had never seen the phenomena referred to; or if we had\r\nseen them, we had not been taught to observe them. You will ask where we\r\npassed our summers? In travelling, or at the seashore, perhaps. But we\r\ntook our city measure with us, and were never quite at home beyond its\r\nlimits.\"\r\n\r\nShe adds: \"I state these facts only to show how much of the world's\r\nbeauty and value may be shut out from the eyes of a human being, by even\r\na careful education! This loss cannot easily be remedied in later years.\r\nI myself had reached mature life before I experienced the deep and calm\r\nenjoyments of country life. The long, still summer days, the open,\r\nfragrant fields, the shy wild blossoms, the song of birds; these won me\r\nat last to delight in them--at first they seemed to me only a void. It\r\nwas a new gospel that the meadows taught me, and my own little children\r\nwere its interpreters. I know now some country craft, and could even\r\ntrim fruit trees and weed garden beds. But I have always regretted in\r\nthis respect the lost time of youth. When I made acquaintance with\r\nNature, I was too old to learn the skill of gardening. Year after year\r\nin the savage island of Newport, where labor is hard to hire, I have\r\npassed summers ungladdened by so much as a hollyhock, and the garden I\r\nat last managed to secure owes nothing to my skill or knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, people were afraid of the open air in those days. Julia\r\nand her sisters sometimes went for a drive in pleasant weather, dressed\r\nin blue pelisses and yellow satin bonnets to match the chariot; they\r\nrarely went out on foot; when they did, it was in cambric dresses and\r\nkid slippers; the result was apt to be a cold or a sore throat, proving\r\nconclusively to the minds of their elders how much better off they were\r\nwithin doors.\r\n\r\nJulia's nursery recollections were chiefly of No. 16 Bond Street. Here\r\nthe little Wards lived a happy but somewhat sober life, under the\r\nwatchful care of their father, and their faithful Aunt Eliza, known in\r\nthe family as \"Auntie Francis.\"\r\n\r\nThe young mother, in dying, had commended her children specially to the\r\ncare of this, her eldest sister, whose ability had been tried and proved\r\nfrom childhood. In 1810 her father, Benjamin Clarke Cutler, died\r\nsuddenly under singular and painful circumstances. Her mother, crushed\r\nby this event, took to her bed, leaving the care of the family to Eliza,\r\nthen fifteen years of age. Eliza took up the house-mother's burden\r\nwithout question; nursed her mother, husbanded the narrow resources of\r\nthe household, brought up the four younger children with a strong hand.\r\n\"There were giants in those days.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could daunt Eliza Cutler's spirits, which were a perpetual\r\ncordial to those around her. She was often \"borrowed\" by one member and\r\nanother of the family; she threatened to hang a sign over her door with\r\nthe inscription, \"Cheering done here by the job by E. Cutler.\" Her\r\ntongue could be sharp as well as merry; witness many anecdotes.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper of a certain millionnaire, calling upon her to ask the\r\ncharacter of a servant, took occasion to enlarge upon the splendors of\r\nher employer's establishment. \"Mr. So-and-So keeps this; Mr. So-and-So\r\nkeeps that:--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes!\" said Mrs. Francis; \"it is well known that Mr. So-and-So\r\nkeeps everything, except the Ten Commandments!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Mrs. Francis, how _could_ you?\" cried the poor millionnaire when\r\nnext they met.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Eliza Cutler married Dr. John Wakefield Francis, the historian\r\nof Old New York, the beloved physician of a whole generation. He was\r\nalready, as has been seen, a member of the Ward household, friend and\r\nresident physician. His tremendous vitality, his quick sympathies, his\r\namazing flow of vivid and picturesque language, made him the delight of\r\nthe children. He called them by singular pet names, \"Cream Cheese from\r\nthe Dairy of Heaven,\" \"Pocket Edition of Lives of the Saints,\" etc.,\r\netc. He sang to them odd snatches of song which were to delight and\r\nexasperate later generations:--\r\n\r\n  \"To woodman's hut one evening there came\r\n    A physician and a dancing-master:\r\n  The wind did blow, io, io,\r\n    And the rain poured faster and faster.\"\r\n\r\nEdgar Allan Poe said of Dr. Francis that his conversation was \"a sort of\r\nRoman punch, made up of tragedy, comedy, and the broadest of all\r\npossible farce.\"\r\n\r\nIn those days \"The Raven,\" newly published, was the talk of the town.\r\nDr. Francis, meeting Poe, invited him to come to his house on a certain\r\nevening, and straightway forgot the matter. Poe came at the appointed\r\ntime. The Doctor, summoned to the bedside of a patient, left the\r\ndrawing-room hastily, and in the anteroom ran into a tall, cadaverous\r\nfigure in black. Seizing him in his arms, he carried him into the\r\ndrawing-room and set him down before his wife. \"Eliza, my dear--the\r\nRaven!\" and he departed, leaving guest and hostess (the latter had never\r\nheard of \"The Raven\"!) equally petrified.\r\n\r\nMrs. Francis adored her husband, yet he must sometimes have tried her\r\npatience sorely. One evening they had a dinner party, eighteen covers, a\r\nstate occasion. Midway in the repast the Doctor rose, and begging the\r\nguests to excuse him and his wife for a moment, led her, speechless with\r\namazement, into the next room. Here he proceeded to bleed her, removing\r\ntwelve ounces of blood; replying to her piteous protestations, \"Madam, I\r\nsaw that you were on the point of apoplexy, and I judge it best to avert\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIn strong contrast with \"Uncle Doctor\" was \"Uncle Ben,\" the Reverend\r\nBenjamin Clarke Cutler, for many years rector of St. Anne's Church,\r\nBrooklyn. This uncle was much less to Julia's taste: indeed, she was\r\nknown to stamp her childish foot, and cry, \"I don't care for old Ben\r\nCutler!\" Nevertheless he was a saintly and interesting person.\r\n\r\nHe was twelve years old at the time of his father's tragic death, and\r\nwas deeply influenced by it. His youth was made unhappy by spiritual\r\nanguish, duty to his widowed mother and the call to the ministry\r\nfighting within him. The latter conquered. In his twenty-first year he\r\ndrew up, signed, and sealed \"An Instrument of Solemn Surrender of\r\nMyself, Soul and Body, to God!\" This document was in the form of a\r\ntestament, in which he solemnly (\"with death, judgment and eternity in\r\nview\") gave, covenanted, and made over himself, soul and body, all his\r\nfaculties, all his influence in this world, all the worldly goods with\r\nwhich he might be endowed, into the hands of his Creator, Preserver, and\r\nConstant Benefactor, to be his forever, and at his disposal. He goes on\r\nto say: \"Witness, ye holy angels! I am God's servant; witness, thou,\r\nPrince of Hell! I am thy enemy, thy implacable enemy, from this time\r\nforth and forevermore.\"\r\n\r\nThat this covenant was well kept, no one who reads his memoirs and the\r\ntestimony of his contemporaries can doubt.\r\n\r\nThere are many anecdotes of Uncle Ben. Once, during his early ministry,\r\nhe was riding in a crowded stagecoach. One of the passengers swore\r\nprofusely and continuously, to the manifest annoyance of the others.\r\nPresently Dr. Cutler, leaning forward, addressed the swearer.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"you are fond of blasphemy; I am fond of prayer. This is\r\na public conveyance, and for the remainder of our journey, as often as\r\nyou swear aloud, I shall pray aloud, and we will see who comes off\r\nbest.\" The swearing stopped!\r\n\r\nIn his later years, he met one day a parishioner clad in deep mourning\r\nfor a near relative. The old clergyman laid his hand on the crape\r\nsleeve. \"What!\" he said sternly. \"Heathen mourning for a Christian\r\nsaint!\"\r\n\r\nBut of all the uncles (and there were many) the beloved Uncle John Ward\r\nwas always first. Of him, through many years Julia's devoted friend and\r\nchief adviser, we shall speak later on.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt upon the generation preceding our mother's, because all\r\nthese people, the beautiful mother so early lost, so long loved and\r\nmourned, the sternly devoted father, the vivacious aunts, the stalwart\r\nuncles, were strong influences in the life of Julia Ward.\r\n\r\nThe amusements of the little Wards were few, compared with those of\r\nchildren of to-day. As a child of seven, Julia was taken twice to the\r\nopera, and heard Malibran, then Signorina Garcia, a pleasure the memory\r\nof which remained with her through life. About this time Mr. Ward's\r\nviews of religious duty deepened in stringency and in gloom. There was\r\nno more opera, nor did Julia ever attend a theatre until she was a grown\r\nwoman. In Low Church circles at that time, the drama was considered\r\ndistinctly of the devil. The burning of the first Bowery Theatre and of\r\nthe great theatre at Richmond, Virginia, were spoken of as \"judgments.\"\r\nMany an Evangelical pastor \"improved\" the occasions from the pulpit.\r\n\r\nThe child inherited a strong dramatic sense from the Marion Cutlers. She\r\nhad barely learned to read when she found in an \"Annual\" a tale called\r\n\"The Iroquois Bride,\" which she dramatized and presented to the nursery\r\naudience, with herself for the bride, her brother Marion for the lover,\r\nand a stool for the rock they ascended to stab each other. The\r\nperformance was not approved by Authority, and the book was promptly\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nHer first written drama was composed at the age of nine, but even the\r\nname of it is lost.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward did not encourage intimacies with other children. He felt\r\nstrongly that brothers and sisters were the true, and should be the\r\nonly, intimates for one another; indeed, the six children were enough to\r\nmake a pleasant little circle of their own, and there were merry games\r\nin the wide nursery. Sam, the eldest born, was master of the revels in\r\nchildhood, as throughout his life. It was his delight, in the early\r\nmorning, to wrap himself in a sheet, and bursting into the room where\r\nthe little sisters slept, leap from bed to bed, announcing himself as a\r\nghost come to haunt them; or, when the three ladies, Mrs. Mills, Mrs.\r\nBrown, and Mrs. Francis (otherwise known as Julia, Louisa, and Annie)\r\nwere playing with their dolls, to whisper in their ears that they must\r\non no account venture near the attic stairs, as an old man in red was\r\nsitting there. Of course the little Fatimas must needs peep, and the old\r\nman was always there, a terrible figure, his face hidden. In \"Bro'\r\nSam's\" absence it was Marion who played the outlaw and descended like a\r\nwhirlwind upon the unhappy ladies, who were journeying through dense and\r\ndreadful forests.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mills, Mrs. Brown, and Mrs. Francis were devoted mothers, and\r\nreared large families of dolls. They kept house in a wide bureau drawer,\r\ndivided into three parts. Our Aunt Annie (Mrs. Adolphe Mailliard)\r\nwrites: \"Mrs. Mills' (Julia) dolls were always far more picturesquely\r\ndressed than ours, although I can say little for their neatness. Oh! to\r\nwhat numberless parties they went, and how tipsy they invariably got! I\r\ncan see distinctly to-day the upset wagon (boxes, on spools for wheels),\r\nand the muddy dresses, for they always fell into mud puddles.\"\r\n\r\nMarion was as pious as he was warlike. His morning sermons, delivered\r\nover the back of a chair, were fervent and eloquent; he was only seven\r\nyears old when he wrote to his Cousin Henry Ward, who was ill with some\r\nchildish ailment:--\r\n\r\n\"Do not forget to say your prayers every morning and evening. I hope\r\nthat you trust in God; and, my dear cousin, do not set your mind too\r\nmuch on Earthly things! And my dear cousin, this is the prayer.\"\r\n\r\nFollows the Lord's Prayer carefully written out. On the next page of the\r\nsame sheet, the eight-year-old Julia adds her exhortation:--\r\n\r\n\"Dear Cousin, I hope that you will say the Prayer which my Brother has\r\nwritten for you. I hear with regret that you are sick, and it is as\r\nnecessary as ever that you should trust in God; love him, dear Henry,\r\nand you will see Death approaching with joy. Oh, what are earthly\r\nthings, which we must all lose when we die--to our immortal souls which\r\nnever die! I cannot bear the thought of anybody who is dying without a\r\nknowledge of Christ. We may die before to-morrow, and therefore we ought\r\nto be prepared for death.\"\r\n\r\nThis was scarcely cheering for Henry, aged ten; as a matter of fact, he\r\nwas to have half a century in which to make his preparations.\r\n\r\nSome of the nursery recollections were the reverse of merry. When Julia\r\nwas still a little child, the old housekeeper died. The children loved\r\nher, and Auntie Francis did not wish them to be saddened by the funeral\r\npreparations; she gave them a good dose of physic all round and put them\r\nto bed for the day.\r\n\r\nJulia was a beautiful child, but she had red hair, which was then\r\nconsidered a sad drawback. She could remember visitors condoling with\r\nher mother on this misfortune, and the gentle lady deploring it also,\r\nand striving by the use of washes and leaden combs to darken the\r\nover-bright locks. Still, some impression of good looks must have\r\nreached the child's mind; for one day, desiring to know what she really\r\nwas like, she scrambled up on a chair, then on a dressing-table, and\r\ntook a good look in the mirror.\r\n\r\n\"_Is that all?_\" she cried, and scrambled down again, a sadly\r\ndisappointed child.\r\n\r\nHer first lessons were from governesses and masters; when she was nine\r\nyears old, she was sent to a private school in the neighborhood. She was\r\nplaced in a class with older girls, and learned by heart many pages of\r\nPaley's \"Moral Philosophy\"; memorizing from textbooks formed in those\r\ndays a great part of the school curriculum. She did not care especially\r\nfor Paley, and found chemistry (without experiments!) and geometry far\r\nmore interesting; but history and languages were the studies she loved.\r\nShe had learned in the nursery to speak French fluently; she soon began\r\nthe study of Latin. Hearing a class reciting an Italian lesson, she was\r\nenchanted with the musical sound of the language; listened and marked,\r\nday after day, and presently handed to the amazed principal a note\r\ncorrectly written in Italian, begging permission to join the class.\r\n\r\nAt nine years old she was reading \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" and seeking its\r\ncharacters in the people she met every day. She always counted it one of\r\nthe books which had most influenced her. Another was Gibbon's \"Decline\r\nand Fall of the Roman Empire,\" which she read at seventeen.[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] In later life she added to these the works of Spinoza, and of\r\n  Theodore Parker.\r\n\r\nShe began at an early age to write verse. A manuscript volume has been\r\npreserved in which some of these early poems were copied for her father.\r\n\r\nThe title-page and dedication are here reproduced:--\r\n\r\n               Poems\r\n            Dedicated to\r\n          Samuel Ward esq\r\n              By His\r\n       affectionate daughter\r\n            Julia Ward.\r\n       _LET ME BE THINE!_\r\n    Regard not with a critic's eye.\r\n  New York                     1831.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 To Samuel Ward.\r\n\r\nBeloved father,\r\n\r\nExpect not to find in these juvenile productions the delicacy and grace\r\nwhich pervaded the writings of that dear parent who is now in glory. I\r\nam indeed conscious of the many faults they contain, but my object in\r\npresenting you with these (original) poems, has been to give you a\r\nlittle memorial of my early life, and I entreat you to remember that\r\nthey were written in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth years of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n                                         Your loving daughter\r\n                                                           JULIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe titles show the trend of the child's thought: \"All things shall pass\r\naway\"; \"We return no more\"; \"Invitation to Youth\" (1831!); \"To my dear\r\nMother\"; \"Mine is the power to make thee whole\"; \"To an infant's\r\ndeparting spirit\"; \"Redeeming Love\"; \"My Heavenly Home,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAt Newport, in 1831, she wrote the following:--\r\n\r\nMORNING HYMN\r\n\r\n  Now I see the morning light,\r\n  Shining bright and gay.\r\n  God has kept me through the night;\r\n  He will, if He thinks it right,\r\n  Preserve me through this day.\r\n\r\n  Let thy holy Spirit send\r\n  Of heavenly light a ray;\r\n  Thy face, oh! Lord, I fain would seek,\r\n  But I am feeble, vain and weak;\r\n  Oh, guide me in thy way!\r\n\r\n  Let thy assistance, Lord, be given,\r\n  That when life's path I've trod,\r\n  And when the last frail tie is riven,\r\n  My spirit may ascend to heaven,\r\n  To dwell with thee, My God.\r\n\r\nWe cannot resist quoting a stanza from the effusion entitled \"Father's\r\nBirthday\":--\r\n\r\n  Louisa brings a cushion rare,\r\n  Anne Eliza a toothpick bright and fair;\r\n  And O! accept the gift I bring,\r\n  It is a _daughter's_ offering.\r\n\r\nJulia's mind was not destined to remain in the evangelical mould which\r\nmust have so rejoiced the heart of her father. In 1834, at the ripe age\r\nof fifteen, she describes her\r\n\r\n                             \"Vain Regrets\r\n\r\nwritten on looking over a diary kept while I was under serious\r\nimpressions\":--\r\n\r\n  Oh! happy days, gone, never to return\r\n  At which fond memory will ever burn,\r\n  Oh, Joyous hours, with peace and gladness blest,\r\n  When hope and joy dwelt in this careworn breast.\r\n\r\nThe next poem, \"The Land of Peace,\" breaks off abruptly at the third\r\nline, and when she again began to write religious verse, it was from a\r\nwidely different standpoint.\r\n\r\nIt may have been about this time that she tried to lead her sisters into\r\nthe path of poesy.\r\n\r\nComing one day into the nursery, in serious mood, she found the two\r\nlittle girls playing some childish game. Miss Ward (she was always Miss\r\nWard, even in the nursery!) rebuked them for their frivolity; bade them\r\nturn their thoughts to graver matters, and write poetry.\r\n\r\nLouisa refused point-blank, but little Annie, always anxious to please,\r\nwent dutifully to work, and produced the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  He feeds the ravens when they call,\r\n  And stands them in a pleasant hall.\r\n\r\n\"Mitter Ward\" (to give him his nursery title) treasured these tokens of\r\npious and literary promise. He even responded in kind, as is shown by\r\nsome verses which are endorsed:--\r\n\r\n           \"From my dearest Father.\r\n                JULIA EUPHROSYNE WARD [_sic_].\"\r\n\r\nHis letters are full of playful affection. He would fain be father and\r\nmother both to the children who were now his all. Under the austere\r\nexterior lay a tenderness which perhaps they hardly comprehended at the\r\ntime. It was in fact this very anguish of solicitude, this passionate\r\nwish that they should not only have, but be everything desirable and\r\nlovely, that made him outwardly so stern. This sterner note impressed\r\nitself so deeply upon the minds of his children that the anecdotes\r\nfamiliar to our own generation echo it. We see the little Julia, weary\r\nwith long riding in the family coach, suffering her knees to drop apart\r\nchildwise, and we hear Mr. Ward say: \"My daughter, if you cannot sit\r\nlike a lady, we will stop at the next tailor's and have you measured for\r\na pair of pantaloons!\"\r\n\r\nOr we hear the child at table, remarking innocently that the cheese is\r\nstrong; and the deep voice replying, \"It is no more so than the\r\nexpression, Miss!\"\r\n\r\nThe family was still at 16 Bond Street, when all the children had\r\nwhooping-cough severely, and were confined to the house for many weeks.\r\nMrs. Mailliard writes of this time:--\r\n\r\n\"I remember the screened-off corner of the dining-room, which was called\r\nthe Bower, where we each retired when the spasms came on, and the\r\npromises which we vainly gave each other each morning to choke rather\r\nthan cough whilst Uncle Doctor made his visit to the nursery; for the\r\nslightest sound from one of us provoked the general order of a dose all\r\nround.\"\r\n\r\nIt was after this illness that Julia Ward first went to Newport. A\r\nchange of air was prescribed for the children, and they were packed off\r\nto the farmhouse of Jacob Bailey, two or three miles from the town of\r\nNewport. Here they spent a happy summer, to be followed by many others.\r\nThey slept on mattresses stuffed with ground corncobs; the table was\r\nprimitive; but there was plenty of cream and curds, eggs and butter, and\r\nthere was the wonderful air. The children grew fat and hearty, and\r\nscampered all over the island with great delight.\r\n\r\n(But when they went down to the beach, Julia must wear a thick green\r\nworsted veil to preserve her ivory-and-rose complexion.\r\n\r\n\"Little Julia has another freckle to-day!\" a visitor was told. \"It was\r\nnot her fault, the nurse forgot her veil!\")\r\n\r\nJulia recalled Newport in 1832 as \"a forsaken, mildewed place, a sort of\r\nintensified Salem, with houses of rich design, no longer richly\r\ninhabited.\" She was to watch through many years the growth of what was\r\nalways one of the cities of her heart.\r\n\r\nBut we must return to Bond Street, and take one more look at No. 16. The\r\nWards were soon to leave it for a statelier dwelling, but many\r\nassociations would always cling about the old house. Here it was that\r\nthe good old grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Ward, used to come\r\nfrom No. 7 to talk business with his son or to play with the children.\r\nOur mother had a vivid recollection of once, when still a little child,\r\nsitting down at the piano, placing an open music-book on the rack\r\n(though she could not yet read music), and beginning to pound and thump\r\nthe keys with might and main. The Colonel was sitting by, book in hand,\r\nand endured the noise patiently for some time. Finally he said in his\r\ncourtly way, \"Is it so set down in the book, little lady?\" \"Yes,\r\nGrandpapa!\" said naughty Julia, and went on banging; the Colonel, who\r\nindeed had little music, made no further comment. But when a game of\r\n\"Tommy-come-tickle-me\" was toward, the children must step in to No. 7 to\r\nshare that excitement with their grandfather, since no cards were\r\npermitted under Mr. Ward's roof.\r\n\r\nThe year of the first Newport visit, 1832, was also the terrible\r\n\"cholera year.\" Uncle Ben Cutler, at that time city missionary, writes\r\nin his diary:--\r\n\r\n\"The cholera is in Quebec and Montreal. This city is beginning to be\r\nalarmed; Christians are waking up. My soul, how stands the case with\r\nthee?\"\r\n\r\nAnd later:--\r\n\r\n\"I am now in the midst of the pestilence. The cholera, the universal\r\nplague, arrived in this city four weeks ago. It has caused the death of\r\nover nine hundred persons. This day the report of the Board of Health\r\nwas three hundred new cases and one hundred and thirty deaths.\"\r\n\r\nMany parts of the city were entirely deserted. Dr. Cutler retained\r\nthrough life the vivid recollection of riding down Broadway in full\r\ndaylight, meeting no living soul, seeing only a face here and there at\r\nan upper window, peering at him as at a strange sight.\r\n\r\nNewport took the alarm, and forbade steamboats from New York to land\r\ntheir passengers. This behavior was considered very cold-blooded, and\r\ngave rise to the conundrum: \"Why is it impossible for Newporters to take\r\nthe cholera? Answer: Because they have no bowels.\"\r\n\r\nGrandma Cutler was at Newport with the Wards and Francises, and trembled\r\nfor her only son. She implored him to \"flee while it was yet day.\" \"My\r\nmost precious son,\" she cried, \"oh, come out from thence! I entreat you;\r\nlinger not within its walls, as Lot would have done, but for the\r\nfriendly angels that drew him perforce from it!\"\r\n\r\nThe missionary stood firm at his post, and though exhausted by his\r\nlabors, came safe through the ordeal. But Colonel Ward, who had not\r\nthought fit to flee the enemy,--it was not his habit to flee\r\nenemies,--was stricken with the pestilence, and died in New York City,\r\nAugust 16. His death was a grievous blow to Mr. Ward. Not only had he\r\nlost a loving and beloved father, but he had no assurance of the\r\northodoxy of that father's religious opinions. The Colonel was thought\r\nin the family to be of a philosophizing, if not actually sceptical, turn\r\nof mind; it might be that he was not \"safe\"! Years after, Mr. Ward told\r\nJulia of the anguish he suffered from this uncertainty.\r\n\r\nIt is with No. 16 Bond Street that we chiefly associate the sprightly\r\nfigure of \"Grandma Cutler,\" who was a frequent visitor there. The\r\naffection between Mr. Ward and his mother-in-law was warm and lively.\r\nThey had a \"little language\" of their own, and she was Lady Feltham\r\n(from her fondness for Feltham's \"Resolves,\" a book little in demand in\r\nthe twentieth century); and he was her \"saucy Lark,\" or \"Plato.\" Mrs.\r\nCutler died in 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\"THE CORNER\"\r\n\r\n1835-1839; _aet._ 16-20\r\n\r\n  But well I thank my father's sober house\r\n  Where shallow judgment had no leave to be,\r\n  And hurrying years, that, stripping much beside,\r\n  Turned as they fled, and left me charity.\r\n\r\n                                       J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house which Mr. Ward built on the corner of Bond Street and Broadway\r\nwas still standing in the middle of the nineteenth century; a dignified\r\nmansion of brick, with columns and trimmings of white marble.\r\n\r\nIn her \"Reminiscences,\" our mother recalls the spacious rooms, hung with\r\nred, blue, and yellow silk. The yellow drawing-room was reserved for\r\nhigh occasions, and for \"Miss Ward's\" desk and grand piano. This and the\r\nblue room were adorned by fine sculptured mantelpieces, the work of a\r\nyoung sculptor named Thomas Crawford, who was just coming into notice.\r\n\r\nBehind the main house, stretching along Broadway, was the picture\r\ngallery, the first private one in New York, and Mr. Ward's special\r\npride. The children might not mingle in frivolous gayety abroad, but\r\nthey should have all that love, taste, and money could give them at\r\nhome; he filled his gallery with the best pictures he could find. A\r\nfriend (Mr. Prescott Hall), making a timely journey through Spain,\r\nbought for him many valuable pictures, among them a Snyders, a Nicolas\r\nPoussin, a reputed Velasquez and Rembrandt. It was for him that Thomas\r\nCole painted the four pictures representing \"The Voyage of Life,\"\r\nengravings from which may still be found in old-fashioned parlors.\r\n\r\nSome years later, when the eldest son, Samuel, returned from Europe,\r\nbringing with him a fine collection of books, Mr. Ward built a library\r\nspecially for them.\r\n\r\nThis was the house into which the family moved in 1835, Julia being then\r\nsixteen years of age; this was the house she loved, the memory of which\r\nwas dear to her through all the years of her life.\r\n\r\nThe family was at that time patriarchal in its dimensions: Mr. Ward and\r\nhis six children, Dr. and Mrs. Francis and their four; often, too,\r\n\"Grandma Cutler\" and other Cutlers, not to speak of Wards, Greenes, and\r\nMcAllisters. (Louisa, youngest of the Cutler sisters, one of the most\r\nbeautiful and enchanting women of her time, was married to Matthew Hall\r\nMcAllister.) One and all were sure of a welcome at \"The Corner\"; one and\r\nall were received with cordial urbanity, first by Johnson, the colored\r\nbutler, later by Mr. Ward, the soul of dignified hospitality.\r\n\r\nAnother inmate of the house during several years was Christy\r\nEvangelides, a Greek boy, orphaned in a Turkish massacre. Mr. Ward took\r\nthe boy into his family, gave him his education and a start in life.\r\nFifty years later Mr. Evangelides recalled those days in a letter to his\r\n\"sister Julia,\" and paid beautiful tribute to his benefactor.\r\n\r\nTo all these should be added a host of servants and retainers; and\r\nmasters of various kinds, coming to teach music, languages, even\r\ndancing, for the children were taught to dance even if they never (or\r\nvery seldom) were allowed to go to dances. Many of these teachers were\r\nforeign patriots: those were the days when one French _émigré_ of rank\r\ndressed the hair of fashionable New York, while another made its salads,\r\nthe two going their rounds before every festivity.\r\n\r\nJulia's musical education began early. Her first teacher was a French\r\nartist, so irritable that the terrified child could remember little that\r\nhe taught her. He was succeeded in her tenth year by Mr. Boocock, a\r\npupil of Cramer, to whom she always felt that she owed a great deal. Not\r\nonly did he train her fingers so carefully that after eighty years they\r\nstill retained their flexibility, but he also trained and developed her\r\ninborn taste for all that was best in music.\r\n\r\nAs she grew toward girlhood, the good master found that her voice\r\npromised to be a remarkable one, and recommended to her father Signor\r\nCardini, formerly an intimate of the Garcia family, and thoroughly\r\nversed in the famous Garcia method. Under his care Julia's voice\r\ndeveloped into a pure, clear mezzo-soprano, of uncommon range and\r\nexquisite quality. She felt all through her life the benefit of those\r\nearly lessons.\r\n\r\nWhen she was eighty years old she attended a meeting of the National\r\nPeace Society at Park Street Church, Boston. The church was packed with\r\npeople. When her turn came to speak, the kindly chairman said:--\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are now to have the great pleasure of\r\nlistening to Mrs. Howe. I am going to ask you all to be very quiet, for\r\nthough Mrs. Howe's voice is as sweet as ever, it is perhaps not quite so\r\nstrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"_But it carries!_\" said the pupil of old Cardini. The silver tone,\r\nthough not loud, reached the farthest corner of the great building; the\r\nhouse \"came down\" in a thunder of applause. It was a beautiful moment\r\nfor the proud daughter who sat beside her.\r\n\r\nMusic was one of the passions of her life. Indeed, she felt that it had\r\nsometimes influenced her even too much, and in recording the delight she\r\ntook in the trios and quartets which Mr. Boocock arranged for her, she\r\nadds: \"The reaction from this pleasure, however, was very painful, and\r\ninduced at times a visitation of morbid melancholy, which threatened to\r\nupset my health.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt that \"in the training of young persons, some regard should be\r\nhad to the sensitiveness of youthful nerves, and to the overpowering\r\nresponse which they often make to the appeals of music....\r\n\r\n\"The power and sweep of great orchestral performances, or even the\r\nsuggestive charm of some beautiful voice, will sometimes so disturb the\r\nmental equilibrium of the hearer as to induce in him a listless\r\nmelancholy, or, worse still, an unreasoning and unreasonable\r\ndiscontent.\"[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] _Reminiscences_, p. 43.\r\n\r\nIn a later chapter of her \"Reminiscences,\" she says: \"I left school at\r\nthe age of sixteen, and began thereafter to study in good earnest.\r\nUntil that time a certain over-romantic and imaginative turn of mind had\r\ninterfered much with the progress of my studies. I indulged in\r\nday-dreams which appeared to me far higher in tone than the humdrum of\r\nmy school recitations. When these were at an end, I began to feel the\r\nnecessity of more strenuous application, and at once arranged for myself\r\nhours of study, relieved by the practice of vocal and instrumental\r\nmusic.\"\r\n\r\nThese hours of study were not all passed at home. In 1836 she was taking\r\ncertain courses at the boarding and day school of Mrs. E. Smith, then in\r\nFifth Avenue, \"first house from Washington Square.\"\r\n\r\nThe Italian master was a son of the venerable Lorenzo da Ponte, who in\r\nhis youth had written for Mozart the librettos of \"Don Giovanni\" and \"Le\r\nNozze di Figaro.\"\r\n\r\nFour languages, English, French, German, and Italian, Julia learned\r\nthoroughly; she spoke and wrote them throughout her life correctly as\r\nwell as fluently, with singularly pure accent and inflection, and seldom\r\nor never was at a loss for a word; nor was she less proficient in\r\nhistory. For mathematics she had no gift, and was wont to say that her\r\nknowledge of the science was limited to the fact that four quarts made a\r\ngallon: yet the higher mathematics had a mysterious attraction for her,\r\nas an unexplored region of wonder and romance.\r\n\r\nShe was always a student. When she began the study of German, she set\r\nherself a task each day; lest anything should interfere to distract her\r\nmind, she had herself securely tied to her armchair, giving orders that\r\nshe was on no account to be set free before the appointed hour.\r\n\r\nThis was characteristic of her through life. The chain of habit once\r\nformed was never broken, and study was meat and drink to her. Her\r\n\"precious time\" (which we children saucily abbreviated to \"P.T.\") was as\r\nreal a thing to us as sunrise: we were not to break in upon it for\r\nanything short of a fire--or a cut finger!\r\n\r\nMany years later, she laid down for the benefit of the younger\r\ngeneration these rules:--\r\n\r\n\"If you have at your command three hours _per diem_, you may study art,\r\nliterature, and philosophy, not as they are studied professionally, but\r\nin the degree involved in general culture.\r\n\r\n\"If you have but one hour every day, read philosophy, or learn foreign\r\nlanguages, living or dead.\r\n\r\n\"If you can command only fifteen or twenty minutes, read the Bible with\r\nthe best commentaries, and daily a verse or two of the best poetry.\"\r\n\r\nIn the days when Julia was going round the corner to Mrs. Smith's\r\nschool, Sam was newly returned from a long course of study and travel\r\nabroad, while Henry and Marion were at Round Hill School under the care\r\nof Dr. Joseph Greene Cogswell and Mr. George Bancroft. The former was a\r\nbeloved friend of the Ward family, and often visited them. We have\r\npleasant glimpses of the household at this time, when the lines of\r\npaternal guidance, though still firmly, were somewhat less rigidly\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nBreakfast at \"The Corner\" was at eight in winter, and at half past seven\r\nin summer, Mr. Ward reading prayers before the meal, and again at\r\nbedtime. He would often wake his daughters in the morning by pelting\r\nthem with stockings, crying, \"Come, my rosebuds!\"\r\n\r\nThe young people were apt to linger over the breakfast table in talk. If\r\nthis were unduly prolonged, Mr. Ward would appear, \"hatted and booted\r\nfor the day,\" and say, \"Young gentlemen, I am glad that you can afford\r\nto take life so easily. I am old, and must work for my living!\"\r\n\r\nDinner was at four o'clock, supper at half past seven.\r\n\r\nAt table, Julia sat beside her father; he would often take her right\r\nhand in his left, half unconsciously, and hold it for some time,\r\ncontinuing the while to eat his dinner. Julia, her right hand\r\nimprisoned, would sit dinnerless, but never dreamed of remonstrating.\r\n\r\nShe had a habit of dropping her slippers off while at the table. Mr.\r\nWard one day quietly secured an empty slipper with his foot, and then\r\nsaid: \"My daughter, I have left my seals in my room. Will you be so good\r\nas to fetch them for me?\" A moment's agonized search, and Julia went,\r\n\"one shoe off and one shoe on,\" and brought the seals. Nothing was said\r\non either side, but the habit was abandoned.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward's anxious care for his children's welfare extended to every\r\nbranch of their conduct. One evening, walking with Julia, he met his\r\nsons, Henry and Marion, each with a cigar in his mouth. He was much\r\ntroubled, and said: \"Boys, you must give this up, and I will give it up\r\ntoo. From this time I forbid you to smoke, and I will join you in\r\nrelinquishing the habit.\"\r\n\r\nHe never smoked again; nor did the boys--in his presence!\r\n\r\nThree lads, young, handsome, brilliant, and eminently social as were the\r\nWards, could not be kept out of society. They were popular, and would\r\nfain have had Julia, the only one of the three girls who was old enough,\r\nshare in their pleasures; but this might not be. Mr. Ward had money and\r\nsympathy to spare for every benevolent enterprise, but he disliked and\r\ndistrusted \"society\"; he would neither entertain it nor be entertained\r\nby it. Our mother quotes an argument between him and his eldest son on\r\nthis point:--\r\n\r\n\"'Sir,' said my brother, 'you do not keep in view the importance of the\r\nsocial tie.'\r\n\r\n\"'The social what?' asked my father.\r\n\r\n\"'The social tie, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"'I make small account of that,' said the elder gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"'I will die in defence of it!' impetuously rejoined the younger.\r\n\r\n\"My father was so amused at this sally that he spoke of it to an\r\nintimate friend: 'He will die in defence of the social tie, indeed!'\"\r\n\r\nJulia's girlhood evenings were mostly spent at home, with books,\r\nneedlework, and music, varied by an occasional lecture or concert, or a\r\nvisit to some one of the uncles' houses in the street, which ought, one\r\nwould think, to have been called \"Ward Street,\" since at this time\r\nalmost the whole family connection lived there.\r\n\r\nMuch as Julia loved her home, her books and music, she longed for some\r\nof the gayety which her brothers were enjoying. \"I seemed to myself,\"\r\nshe says, \"like a young damsel of olden times, shut up within an\r\nenchanted castle. And I must say, that my dear father, with all his\r\nnoble generosity and overweening affection, sometimes appeared to me as\r\nmy jailer.\"\r\n\r\nOnce she expostulated with him, begging to be allowed more freedom in\r\ngoing out, and in receiving visits from the friends of her brothers. It\r\nmay have been on the occasion when he refused to allow the late Louis\r\nRutherford, of venerated memory, to be invited to the house, \"because he\r\nbelonged to the fashionable world.\"\r\n\r\nHer father told her that he had early recognized in her a temperament\r\nand imagination over-sensitive to impressions from without, and that his\r\nwish had been to guard her from exciting influences until she should\r\nappear to him fully able to guard and guide herself.\r\n\r\nAlas! the tender father meant to cherish a vestal flame in a vase of\r\nalabaster; in reality, he was trying to imprison the lightning in the\r\ncloud. When our mother wrote the words above quoted, on the power of\r\nmusic over sensitive natures, she was recalling these days, and perhaps\r\nremembering how, denied the society of her natural mates, her\r\nsixteen-year-old heart went out in sympathy and compassion to the young\r\nharper who came to take part in the trios and quartets, and who fell\r\ndesperately in love with her and was summarily dismissed in consequence.\r\n\r\nYet who shall say that the father's austere régime did not after all\r\nmeet a need of her nature deeper than she could possibly have realized\r\nat the time; that the long, lonely hours, the study often to\r\nweariness,--though never to satiety,--the very fires of longing and of\r\nregret, were not necessary to give her mind that temper which was to\r\nmake it an instrument as strong as it was keen?\r\n\r\nThe result of this system was not precisely what Mr. Ward had expected.\r\nOne evening (it was probably after the marriage of his eldest son to\r\nEmily Astor, when he joined perforce in the festivities of the time) he\r\ndid actually take Julia to an evening party. She did not dance, but she\r\nwas surrounded by eager youths all the evening, and when her father\r\nsummoned her to go home, she was deep in talk with one of them. There\r\nwas no disobeying the summons; as she turned to take her father's arm,\r\nMiss Julia made a little gesture of farewell, fluttering the fingers of\r\nher right hand over her shoulder, to cheer the disconsolate swain. Mr.\r\nWard appeared unconscious of this, but a day or two later, on leaving\r\nthe room where Julia was sitting, he said: \"My daughter,--\" and\r\nfluttered his fingers over his shoulder in precise mimicry of her\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote describes an occasion singularly characteristic of both\r\nfather and daughter.\r\n\r\nJulia was nineteen years old, a woman grown, feeling her womanhood in\r\nevery vein. She had never been allowed to choose the persons who should\r\nbe invited to the house: she had never had a _party of her own_. The\r\ndifferent strains in her blood were singularly diverse. All through her\r\nlife Saxon and Gaul kept house together as peaceably as they might, but\r\nsometimes the French blood boiled over.\r\n\r\nCalling her brothers in council, she told them that she was going to\r\ngive a party; that she desired their help in making out lists, etc., but\r\nthat the occasion and the responsibility were to be all her own. The\r\nbrothers demurred, even Sam being somewhat appalled by the prospect; but\r\nfinding her firm, they made out a list of desirable guests, of all ages.\r\nIt was characteristic of her that the plan once made, the resolve taken,\r\nit became an obsession, a thing that must be done at whatever cost.\r\n\r\nShe asked her father if she might invite a few friends for a certain\r\nevening: he assented. She engaged the best caterer in New York; the most\r\nfashionable musicians; she even hired a splendid cut-glass chandelier to\r\nsupplement the sober lighting of the yellow drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe evening came: Mr. Ward, coming downstairs, found assembled as\r\nbrilliant a gathering as could have been found in any other of the great\r\nhouses of New York. He betrayed no surprise, but welcomed his guests\r\nwith charming courtesy, as if they had come at his special desire; the\r\nmusic sounded, the young people danced, the evening passed off\r\ndelightfully, to all save the young hostess. She, from the moment when\r\nthe thing was inevitable, became as possessed with terror as she had\r\nbeen with desire. She could think of nothing but her father's\r\ndispleasure, of the words he might speak, the glances he might cast upon\r\nher. During the whole evening, the cup of trembling was at her lips.\r\n\r\nThe moment the last guest had departed, the three brothers gathered\r\nround her. \"We will speak to him!\" they cried. \"Let us speak to him for\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Julia, \"I must go myself.\"\r\n\r\nShe went at once to the room where her father sat alone. For a moment\r\nshe could find no words; but none were needed. Gravely but kindly Mr.\r\nWard said he was surprised to find that her idea of \"a few friends\"\r\ndiffered so widely from his own; he was sorry she had not consulted him\r\nmore freely, and begged that in the future she would do so. Then he\r\nkissed her good-night with his usual tenderness, and it was over. The\r\nmatter was never mentioned again.\r\n\r\nThe Wards continued to pass the summers at Newport, but no longer at\r\ngood Jacob Bailey's farmhouse. Mr. Ward had bought a house in town,\r\nwhich a later generation was to know as \"The Ashurst Cottage,\" on the\r\ncorner of Bellevue Avenue and Catherine Street.\r\n\r\nHere the severity of his rule relaxed somewhat, and the pretty house\r\nbecame the centre of a sober hospitality. Indeed, Newport was a sober\r\nplace in those days. There were one or two houses where dancing was\r\nallowed, but these were viewed askance by many people.\r\n\r\nOne evening, a dancing party was given by a couple on Bellevue Avenue.\r\nThey had a manservant named Salathiel, a person of rigid piety. When\r\nsupper-time came, Salathiel was not to be found. The other servants,\r\nbeing questioned, said that he had rushed suddenly out of the house,\r\ncrying, \"I won't stay to see those people dancing themselves to hell!\"\r\n\r\nThough Julia might not dance, except at home, she might and did ride;\r\nfirst, with great contentment, on a Narragansett pacer, \"Jeanie Deans,\"\r\nlater on a thoroughbred mare, a golden bay named Cora. Cora was\r\nbeautiful but \"very pranky.\" After being several times run away with and\r\nonce thrown off, it was observed by her sisters that Julia generally\r\nread her Bible and said her prayers before her ride: she has herself\r\ntold us how, after being thrown off and obliged to make her way home on\r\nfoot, she would creep in at the back door so that no one might see her.\r\n\r\nShe calls the \"cottage\" a \"delightful house,\" and speaks with special\r\npleasure of its garden planted with roses and gooseberry bushes by Billy\r\nBottomore, a quaint old Newport sportsman, who took the boys shooting,\r\nand showed them where to find plover, woodcock, and snipe. Billy\r\nBottomore passed for an adopted son of old Father Corné, another Newport\r\n\"character\" of those days. This gentleman had come from Naples to\r\nBoston, toward the end of the eighteenth century, as a decorative\r\nartist, and had made a modest fortune by painting the walls of the fine\r\nhouses of Summer Street, Temple Place, and Beacon Hill. He chose Newport\r\nas his final home, because, as he told Mr. Ward, he had found that the\r\nclimate was favorable to the growth of the tomato, \"that most wholesome\r\nof vegetables.\" The Ward boys delighted in visiting Father Corné, and in\r\nhearing him sing his old songs, French and Italian, some of which are\r\nsung to-day by our grandchildren.\r\n\r\nFather Corné lived to a great age. When past his ninetieth year, a\r\nfriend asked him if he would not like to revisit Naples. \"Ah, sir,\"\r\nreplied the old man, \"my father is dead!\"\r\n\r\nOur mother loved to linger over these old-time figures. The name of\r\nBilly Bottomore always brought a twinkle to her eye, and we never tired\r\nof hearing how he told her, \"There is a single sister in Newport, a\r\nsempstress, to whom I have offered matrimony, but she says, 'No.'\" The\r\nsingle sister finally yielded (perhaps when Billy inherited old Corné's\r\nmoney) and he became a proud and happy husband. \"She keeps my house as\r\nneat as a nunnery!\" he said. \"When Miss E., the housekeeper, died, she\r\nnursed her and laid her out, and when Father Corné died, she nursed him\r\nand laid him out--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Billy,\" broke in our Aunt Annie, \"and she'll lay you out\r\ntoo!\"--which in due time she did.\r\n\r\nHe congratulated Julia on having girl-children only.\r\n\r\n\"Give me daughters!\" he cried. \"As my good old Spanish grandfather used\r\nto say, give me daughters!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of this Spanish ancestor,\" our mother says, \"no one ever heard before.\r\nHis descendant died, without daughter or son, of cholera in 185-.\"\r\n\r\nWe forget the name of another quaint personage, a retired sea-captain,\r\nwho once gave a party to which she was allowed to go; but she remembered\r\nthe party, and the unction with which the kindly host, rubbing his hands\r\nover the supper table, exclaimed: \"Now, ladies and gentlemen, help\r\nyourselves _sang froidy_!\"\r\n\r\nThe roses and gooseberry bushes of the Newport garden once witnessed a\r\nserio-comic scene. There was another sea-captain, Glover by name, who\r\nhad business connections with Prime, Ward & King, and who came to the\r\nhouse sometimes on business, sometimes for a friendly call. He was a\r\nworthy man of middle age and unromantic appearance; probably the\r\neighteen-year-old Julia, dreamy and poetic, took no more notice of him\r\nthan civility required; but he took notice of her, and one day asked her\r\nto walk out in the garden with him. Wondering much, she went. After some\r\ndesultory remarks, the Captain drew a visiting-card from his pocket,\r\nwrote a few words upon it, and handed it to his young hostess. She\r\nread:--\r\n\r\n                    \"_Russell E. Glover's_\r\n                    heart is yours!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGIRLHOOD\r\n\r\n1839-1843; _aet._ 20-23\r\n\r\n  The torch that lit these silent halls,\r\n  Has now extinguished been;\r\n  The windows of the soul are dark,\r\n  And all is gloom within.\r\n\r\n  But lo! it shines, a star in heav'n,\r\n  And through death's murky night,\r\n  The ruins of the stately pile\r\n  Gleam softly in its light.\r\n\r\n  And it shall be a beacon star\r\n  To cheer us, and to guide;\r\n  For we would live as thou hast lived,\r\n  And die as thou hast died.\r\n\r\n              _Julia Ward_, on her father's death, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Julia's childhood her brother Sam was her ideal and her idol. She\r\ndescribes him as a \"handsome youth, quick of wit and tender of heart,\r\nbrilliant in promise, and with a great and versatile power of work in\r\nhim.\" He had early shown special proficiency in mathematics, and to the\r\nend of his life rejoiced in being one of the few persons who clearly\r\nunderstood the function called \"_Gamma_.\" His masters expected great\r\nthings from him; but his brilliant and effervescent spirit was forced\r\ninto the Wall Street mould, with kindly intent but disastrous effect.\r\nHis life was checkered, sun and shadow; but from first to last, he\r\nremained the delight of all who knew him. Sam Ward; Uncle Sam to three\r\ngenerations, his was a name to conjure with: the soul of generosity, the\r\nessence of wit, the spirit of kindliness. No one ever looked in his\r\nface, ever met the kindling glance of his dark eyes, ever saw the\r\nsunshine break in his smile, without forgetting all else in love and\r\nadmiration of one of the most enchanting personalities that ever\r\nbrightened the world.\r\n\r\nSam Ward returned from Europe in 1835, and took up his residence under\r\nhis father's roof. In 1838 he married Emily, daughter of William B.\r\nAstor. The wedding was a grand one. Julia was first bridesmaid, and wore\r\na dress of white _moiré_, then a material of the newest fashion. Those\r\nwere the days of the _ferronière_, an ornament then so popular that\r\n\"evening dress was scarcely considered complete without it.\"[11] Julia\r\nbegged for one, and her father gave her a charming string of pearls,\r\nwhich she wore with great contentment at the wedding.\r\n\r\n  [11] _Reminiscences_, p. 65.\r\n\r\nThe young couple took up their residence with the family at \"The\r\nCorner,\" the Francises having by this time moved to a house of their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWith all these changes, little by little, the discipline relaxed, the\r\ndoors opened wider. The bridal pair, _fêted_ everywhere, must, in their\r\nturn, entertain their friends; and in these entertainments the daughters\r\nof the house must have their share.\r\n\r\nJulia Ward was now nineteen, in the fulness of her early bloom. Her\r\nred-gold hair was no longer regarded as a misfortune; her gray eyes were\r\nlarge and well opened; her complexion of dazzling purity. Her finely\r\nchiselled features, and the beauty of her hands and arms, made an\r\n_ensemble_ which could not fail to impress all who saw her. Add to this\r\nher singing, her wit, and the charm which was all and always her own,\r\nand we have the _Diva Julia_, as she was called by some who loved her.\r\nHer sisters, also, were growing up, each exquisitely attractive in her\r\nway: they became known as the \"Three Graces of Bond Street.\" Louisa was\r\nlike a damask rose, Annie like a dark lily; dark, too, of eyes and hair\r\nwere Sam and Marion, while Henry was fair and blue-eyed.\r\n\r\nAt this distance of time, it may not be unpardonable to touch briefly on\r\nanother aspect of our mother's youth; indeed, it would hardly be candid\r\nto avoid it. From the first she seems to have stirred the hearts of men.\r\nHer masters, old and young, fell in love with her almost as a matter of\r\ncourse. Gilded youth and sober middle-age fared no better; her girlhood\r\npassed to the sound of sighing.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said an intimate friend of the three, speaking of these days,\r\n\"Louisa had her admirers, and Annie had hers; but when the men saw your\r\nmother, they just _flopped_!\"\r\n\r\nAmong her papers we have found many relics of these days, from the faded\r\nepistle addressed, \"_à Julie, _la respectée_, _la choisie_, _l'aimée_,\r\n_la chérie_,\" to the stern letter in which Mr. Ward \"desires not to\r\nconceal from the Rev. Mr. ---- the deliberate and dispassionate opinion,\r\nthat a gentleman whose sacred office commanded ready access to his roof,\r\nmight well have earlier ascertained the views of a widow'd Father on a\r\nsubject so involving the happiness of his child.\"\r\n\r\nThe unhappy suitor's note to Miss Julia is enclosed, and Mr. Ward\r\ntrusts that \"the return will be considered by the Rev. Mr. ---- as\r\nfinally terminating the matter therein referred to.\"\r\n\r\nJulia had for her suitors a tender and compassionate sympathy. She could\r\nnot love them, she would not marry them, but she was very sorry for\r\nthem, and--it must be admitted--she liked to be adored. So she sang\r\nduets with one, read German with another, Anglo-Saxon with a third; for\r\nall, perhaps, she may have had something the feeling of her \"_Coquette\r\net Tendre_\" in \"Passion Flowers.\"\r\n\r\n  Ere I knew life's sober meaning,\r\n    Nature taught me simple wiles,\r\n  Gave this color, rising, waning,\r\n    Gave these shadows, deepening smiles.\r\n\r\n  More she taught me, sighing, singing,\r\n    Taught me free to think and move,\r\n  Taught this fond instinctive clinging\r\n    To the helpful arm of love.\r\n\r\nThe suitors called her \"_Diva_,\" but in the family circle she was\r\n\"Jules,\" or \"Jolie Julie.\" The family letters of this period are full of\r\naffectionate cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nWhen \"Jolie Julie\" is away on a visit, the others send her a composite\r\nletter. Louisa threatens to shut her up on her return with nothing to\r\nread but her Anglo-Saxon grammar and \"Beowulf.\" (\"If that does not give\r\nyou a distaste for all wolves,\" she says, \"not excepting those _Long\r\nfellows_,[12] I do not know what will!\")\r\n\r\n  [12] Longfellow had lent her \"Beowulf.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie tells of opening the window in Julia's room and of all the\r\npoetical ideas flying out and away.\r\n\r\nEmily, her brother's wife, describes Mr. Ward sighing, \"Where is my\r\nbeauty?\" as he sits at the table; and the letter closes with a lively\r\npicture of the books in the library \"heaving their dusty sides in sorrow\r\nfor her absence.\"\r\n\r\nIn describing life at \"The Corner,\" we must not forget the evenings at\r\nNo. 23, Colonel Henry Ward's house. Uncle Henry and his namesake son\r\n(the boy who was to \"see death approaching with joy\"!) were musical.\r\nWhen Mr. Ward permitted (in his later and more lenient days) an informal\r\ndance at \"The Corner,\" the three girls sent for Uncle Henry as naturally\r\nas they sent for the hair-dressing and salad-making _émigrés_; and the\r\nstately, handsome gentleman came, and played waltzes and polkas with\r\ncheerful patience all the evening.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the whole family from \"The Corner\" took tea with Uncle Henry,\r\nand music was the order of the evening. Mr. Ward delighted in these\r\noccasions, and was never ready to go home. When Uncle Henry thought it\r\nwas bedtime, he would go to the piano and play the \"Rogue's March.\"\r\n\r\n  (Twice flogged for stealing a sheep,\r\n  Thrice flogged for de_sar_tion!\r\n  If ever I go for a soldier again,\r\n  The devil may be my portion!\r\n\r\nWe hear the fife shrill through the lively air!)\r\n\r\n\"No! no, Colonel!\" Mr. Ward would cry. \"We won't march yet; give us half\r\nan hour more!\" And in affectionate mischief he would stay the half-hour\r\nthrough before marshalling his flock back to \"The Corner.\"\r\n\r\nA stern period was put to all this innocent gayety by the death of Mr.\r\nWard, at the age of fifty-three. His life, always laborious, had been\r\ndoubly so since the death of his wife. Stunned at first by the blow, his\r\nstrong sense of duty soon roused him to resume his daily\r\nresponsibilities--with a difference, however. Religion had always been a\r\npowerful factor in his life; henceforth it was to be his main\r\ninspiration, and he found his chief comfort in works of public and\r\nprivate beneficence.\r\n\r\nAn earnest patriot, he was no politician; but when his services were\r\nneeded by city, state, or country, they were always forthcoming.\r\nThroughout the series of financial disasters beginning with Andrew\r\nJackson's refusal to renew the charter of the Bank of the United States,\r\nand culminating in the panic of 1837, Mr. Ward acted with vigor,\r\ndecision, and sagacity. His denunciation of the removal of the public\r\ndeposits from the Bank of the United States by the famous Specie\r\nCircular as \"an act so lawless, violent, and fraught with disaster, that\r\nit would and must eventually overthrow the men and the party that\r\nresorted to it,\" was justified, literally and entirely.\r\n\r\nThe crisis of 1836-37 called for all the strength, wisdom, and public\r\nspirit that the men of the country could show. Mr. Ward labored day and\r\nnight to prevent the dishonor of the banks of New York.\r\n\r\n\"Individual effort, however, was vain, and the 10th of May saw all the\r\nbanks reduced to suspend specie payments; and upon no man did that\r\ndisastrous day close with deeper mortification than upon him.\r\nPersonally, and in his business relations, this event affected Mr. Ward\r\nas little possibly as any one at all connected with affairs; but, in his\r\nestimation, it vitally wounded the commercial honor and character of the\r\ncity. He was not, however, a man to waste, in unavailing regrets, hours\r\nthat might be more advantageously employed to repair the evil, and he\r\ntherefore at once set about the arrangement of measures for inducing and\r\nenabling the banks to resume at the earliest possible moment.\"[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] _The Late Samuel Ward_, by Mr. Charles King.\r\n\r\nThis was accomplished within the year. About the same time the Bank of\r\nEngland sent to Prime, Ward & King a loan of nearly five million dollars\r\nin gold. Mr. King says, \"This extraordinary mark of confidence, this\r\nwell-earned tribute to the prudence and integrity of the house, Mr. Ward\r\ndid not affect to undervalue, and confirming, as it did, the sagacity of\r\nhis own views, and the results which he had so confidently foretold, it\r\nwas not lost upon the community in the midst of which he lived.\"\r\n\r\nOur mother never forgot the afternoon when Brother Sam came into her\r\nstudy on his return from Wall Street and cried out to her:--\r\n\r\n\"Julia, men have been going up and down the office stairs all day long,\r\ncarrying little wooden kegs of gold on their backs, marked 'Prime, Ward\r\n& King' and filled with English gold!\"\r\n\r\nThat English gold saved the honor of the Empire State, and the fact that\r\nher father procured the loan was the greatest asset in her inheritance\r\nfrom the old firm.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward did not see the kegs, for he was in bed, prostrated by a severe\r\nfit of sickness brought on by his labors for the public honor. The few\r\nyears that remained to him were a very martyrdom, his old enemy,\r\nrheumatic gout, attacking him more and more fiercely; but his spirit was\r\nindomitable. He labored almost single-handed to establish the Bank of\r\nCommerce, and became its first president, stipulating that he should\r\nreceive no compensation. What he did receive was his death-warrant. The\r\ndampness of the freshly plastered walls of the new building brought on\r\nin the spring of 1839 two successive attacks so severe that he could not\r\nrally from them. Still he toiled on, giving all his energies to perfect\r\nand consolidate the enterprise which he believed would be of lasting\r\nbenefit to his beloved city.\r\n\r\nIn October of the same year came another financial crisis. The banks of\r\nPhiladelphia and the Southern States suspended specie payments, and\r\nevery effort was made to induce the New York banks to follow suit. Mr.\r\nWard was ill at Newport, but hearing the news he hurried back and threw\r\nhimself into the conflict, exhorting, sustaining, encouraging.\r\n\r\nA friend protested, warning him of the peril to his enfeebled health of\r\nsuch exertions. \"I should esteem life itself not unworthily sacrificed,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Ward, \"if by word or deed, I could aid the banks in adhering\r\nfaithfully to their duty.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly two weeks he labored, till the work was done, his city's\r\nhonor and fair fame secure; then he went home literally to die,\r\ndeparting this life, November 27, 1839.\r\n\r\nJulia was with him when he died, his hand in hers. The beauty of his\r\ncountenance in death was such that Anne Hall, the well-known miniature\r\npainter, begged permission to paint it, and his descendants may still\r\ngaze on the majestic features in their serene repose.\r\n\r\nOur mother writes of this time: \"I cannot, even now, bear to dwell upon\r\nthe desolate hush which fell upon our house when its stately head lay,\r\nsilent and cold, in the midst of weeping friends and children.\"[14]\r\n\r\n  [14] _Reminiscences_, p. 53.\r\n\r\nHer love for her father was to cease only with her life. She never\r\nfailed to record his birthday in her diary, with some word of tender\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nShortly before Mr. Ward's death, Sam and his wife had moved to a house\r\nof their own. The five unmarried children would have been desolate,\r\nindeed, if left to themselves in the great house: but to the joy and\r\ncomfort of all, their bachelor uncle, John Ward, left his own house and\r\ncame to live with them. From this time until his death in 1866, he was a\r\nsecond father to them.\r\n\r\n_Uncle John!_ The words call up memories of our own childhood. We see a\r\ntall, stalwart figure, clad in loose-fitting garments; a noble head\r\ncrowned by a small brown scratch wig; a countenance beaming with\r\nkindliness and humor. A Manila cheroot is between his lips--the\r\nfragrance of one never fails to call up his image--and he caresses an\r\nunamiable little dog which he fondly loves. He offers a grand-niece a\r\nsilk dress if she will make it up herself. This was the \"Uncle John\" of\r\nNo. 8 Bond Street, one of the worthies of Wall Street, and uncle, by\r\ncourtesy, to half New York.\r\n\r\nIn his youth he had received an injury which deprived him of speech for\r\nmore than a year. It was feared that he would never speak again; one day\r\nhis mother, trying to help him in some small matter, and not succeeding\r\nto her mind, cried, \"I am a poor, awkward, old woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"_No, you are not!_\" exclaimed John Ward; and the trouble was over.\r\n\r\nHis devotion to his orphan nieces and nephews was constant and\r\nbeautiful. He desired ardently that the three girls should be good\r\nhousekeepers, and grudged the amount of time which one of them at least\r\ndevoted to books and music. To them also he was fond of giving\r\ndress-materials, with the proviso that they should make them up for\r\nthemselves. This they managed to do, \"with a good deal of help from the\r\nfamily seamstress.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Julia published her first literary venture, a translation of\r\nLamartine's \"Jocelyne,\" Uncle John showed her a favorable notice of it\r\nin a newspaper, saying: \"This is my little girl who knows about books,\r\nand writes an article and has it printed, but I wish she knew more about\r\nhousekeeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sentiment,\" she adds, \"which in after years I had occasion to echo\r\nwith fervor.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Sam was her ideal of youthful manhood, Henry was her mate, the\r\nnearest to her in age and in sympathy. The bond between them was close\r\nand tender; and when in October, 1840, he died of typhoid fever, the\r\nblow fell on her with crushing severity.\r\n\r\n\"When he closed his eyes,\" she says, \"I would gladly, oh, so gladly have\r\ndied with him!\" And again, \"I remember the time as one without light or\r\ncomfort.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to seek consolation in religion, and--naturally--in that\r\naspect of religion which had been presented to her childish mind as the\r\ntrue and only one. At this time a great Calvinistic revival was going on\r\nin New York, and a zealous friend persuaded Julia to attend some of the\r\nmeetings. In her anguish of grief, the gloomy doctrines of natural\r\ndepravity, of an angry and vengeful Deity, of a salvation possible only\r\nthrough certain strictly defined channels, came home to her with\r\nterrible force. Her deeply religious nature sought the Divine under\r\nhowever portentous an aspect it was presented; her poet's imagination\r\nclung to the uplifted Cross; these were days of emotion, of fervor, of\r\nexaltation alternating with abasement; _thought_ was to come later.\r\n\r\nWhile under these influences, Julia, now at the head of the household,\r\nenforced her Calvinistic principles with rigor. The family were allowed\r\nonly cold meat on Sunday, to their great discomfort; the rather\r\nuninviting midday dinner was named by Uncle John \"Sentiment\"; but at six\r\no'clock they were given hot tea, and this he called \"Bliss.\" Pious\r\nexhortations, sisterly admonitions, were the order of the day. \"The Old\r\nBird\"--this _nom de tendresse_ had now superseded \"Jolie Julie,\" and was\r\nto be hers while her sisters and brothers lived--hovered over the\r\nyounger ones with maternal anxiety. In the poems and letters of this\r\nperiod, she adopts unconsciously the phraseology of the day.\r\n\r\nBeing away on a visit, she writes to her sisters: \"Believe me, it is\r\nbetter to set aside, untasted, the cup of human enjoyment, than to drink\r\nit to the bitter dregs, and then seek for something better, which may\r\nnot be granted to us. The _manna_ fell from heaven early in the morning,\r\nthose who then neglected to gather it were left without nourishment; it\r\nis early in life's morning that we must gather the heavenly food, which\r\ncan alone support us through the burden and heat of the day.\"\r\n\r\nThe emotional fervor of this time was heightened by a complication which\r\narose from it. A young clergyman of brilliant powers and passionate\r\nnature fell deeply in love with Julia, and pressed his suit with such\r\nardor that she consented to a semi-engagement. Fortunately, a visit to\r\nBoston gave her time to examine her feelings. Relieved from the pressure\r\nof a twofold excitement, breathing a calmer and a freer air, she\r\nrealized that there could be no true union between her and the Rev. Mr.\r\n----, and the connection was broken off.\r\n\r\nThe course of Julia's studies had for some years been leading her into\r\nwider fields of thought.\r\n\r\nIn her brother's library she found George Sand and Balzac, and read such\r\nbooks as he selected for her. In German she became familiar with Goethe,\r\nJean Paul, and Matthias Claudius. She describes the sense of\r\nintellectual freedom derived from these studies as \"half delightful,\r\nhalf alarming.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ward one day had undertaken to read an English translation of\r\n\"Faust\" and came to her in great alarm. \"My daughter,\" he said, \"I hope\r\nthat you have not read this wicked book!\" She had read it, and \"Wilhelm\r\nMeister,\" too (though in later life she thought the latter \"not\r\naltogether good reading for the youth of our country\"). Shelley was\r\nforbidden, and Byron allowed only in small and carefully selected doses.\r\n\r\nThe twofold bereavement which weighed so heavily upon her checked for a\r\ntime the development of her thought, throwing her back on the ideas\r\nwhich her childhood had received without question; but her buoyant\r\nspirit could not remain long submerged, and as the poignancy of grief\r\nabated, her mind sought eagerly for clearer vision.\r\n\r\nIn the quiet of her own room, the bounds of thought and of faith\r\nstretched wide and wider. Vision often came in a flash: witness the\r\nmoment when the question of Matthias Claudius, \"And is He not also the\r\nGod of the Japanese?\" changed from a shocking suggestion to an eternal\r\ntruth. Witness also the moment when, after reading \"Paradise Lost,\" she\r\nsaw \"the picture of an eternal evil, of Satan and his ministers\r\nsubjugated, indeed, by God, but not conquered, and able to maintain\r\nagainst Him an opposition as eternal as his goodness. This appeared to\r\nme impossible, and I threw away, once and forever, the thought of the\r\nterrible hell which till then had always formed part of my belief. In\r\nits place I cherished the persuasion that the victory of goodness must\r\nconsist in making everything good, and that Satan himself could have no\r\nshield strong enough to resist permanently the divine power of the\r\ndivine spirit.\"\r\n\r\nNew vistas were opening everywhere before her. She made acquaintance\r\nwith Margaret Fuller, who read her poems, and urged her to publish them.\r\nOf one of these poems, Miss Fuller writes:--\r\n\r\n\"It is the record of days of genuine inspiration,--of days when the soul\r\nlay in the light, when the spiritual harmonies were clearly apprehended\r\nand great religious symbols reanimated with their original meaning. Its\r\nnumbers have the fulness and sweetness of young love, young life. Its\r\ngifts were great and demand the service of a long day's work to\r\n_requite_ and to interpret them. I can hardly realize that the Julia\r\nWard I have seen has lived this life. It has not yet pervaded her whole\r\nbeing, though I can recall something of it in the steady light of her\r\neye. May she become all attempered and ennobled by this music. I saw in\r\nher taste, the capacity for genius, and the utmost delicacy of\r\npassionate feeling, but caught no glimpse at the time of this higher\r\nmood.... If she publishes, I would not have her omit the lines about the\r\n'lonely room.' The personal interest with which they stamp that part is\r\nslight and delicate....\r\n\r\n                             \"S. MARGARET FULLER.\r\n\r\n\"I know of many persons in my own circle to whom I think the poem would\r\nbe especially grateful.\"[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] This manuscript poem was lost, together with many others of the\r\n  period, a loss always regretted by our mother.\r\n\r\nOn every hand she met people, who like herself were pressing forward,\r\nseeking new light. She heard Channing preach, heard him say that God\r\nloves bad men as well as good; another window opened in her soul. Again,\r\non a journey to Boston, she met Ralph Waldo Emerson. The train being\r\ndelayed at a wayside station, she saw the Transcendentalist, whom she\r\nhad pictured as hardly human, carrying on his shoulder the child of a\r\npoor and weary woman; her heart warmed to him, and they soon made\r\nacquaintance. She, with the ardor of youth, gave him at some length the\r\nreligious views which she still held in the main, and with which she\r\nfelt he would not agree. She enlarged upon the personal presence of\r\nSatan on this earth, on his power over man. Mr. Emerson replied with\r\ngentle courtesy, \"Surely the Angel must be stronger than the Demon!\" She\r\nnever forgot these words; another window opened, and a wide one.\r\n\r\nJulia Ward had come a long way from old Ascension Church, where Peter\r\nStuyvesant, in a full brown wig, carried round the plate, and the\r\nReverend Manton (afterwards Bishop) Eastburn preached sermons \"remarked\r\nfor their good English\"; and where communicants were not expected to go\r\nto balls or theatres.\r\n\r\nThe years of mourning over, the Ward sisters took up the pursuits\r\nnatural to their age and position. Louisa was now eighteen, very\r\nbeautiful, already showing the rare social gift which distinguished her\r\nthrough life. The two sisters began a season of visiting, dancing, and\r\nall manner of gayeties.\r\n\r\nThe following letter illustrates this period of her girlhood:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _To her sisters_\r\n\r\n                                         BOSTON (1842).\r\n                          Friday, that's all I know about to-day.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST CHICKS,--\r\n\r\nThough I have a right to be tired, having talked and danced for the two\r\nlast nights, yet my enjoyment is most imperfect until I have shared it\r\nwith you, so I must needs write to you, and tell you what a very nice\r\ntime I am having. Last night I went to a party at Miss Shaw's, given to\r\n_Boz and me_, at least, I was invited before he came here, so think that\r\nI will only give him an equal share of the honor. I danced a good deal,\r\nwith some very agreeable partners, and talked as usual with Sumner,\r\nHillard,[16] Longo,[17] etc. I was quite pleased that Boz recognized\r\nFanny Appleton and myself, and gave us a smile and bow _en passant_. He\r\ncould do no more, being almost torn to pieces by the crowd which throngs\r\nhis footsteps, wherever he goes. I like to look at him, he has a bright\r\nand most speaking countenance, and his face is all wrinkled with the\r\nlines, not of care, but of laughter. His manners are very free and\r\ncordial, and he seems to be as capital a fellow as one would suppose\r\nfrom his writings. He circulates as universally as small change, and\r\nunderstands the art of gratifying others without troubling himself, of\r\nletting himself be seen without displaying himself--now this speaks for\r\nhis real good taste, and shows that if not a gentleman born and bred, he\r\nis at least a man, every inch of him.\r\n\r\n  [16] George S. Hillard.\r\n\r\n  [17] Longfellow.\r\n\r\n... I have had hardly the least dash of Transcendentalism, and that of\r\nthe very best description, a lecture and a visit from Emerson, in both\r\nof which he said beautiful things, and to-morrow (don't be shocked!) a\r\nconversation at Miss Fuller's, which I shall treasure up for your\r\namusement and instruction. I have also heard (don't go into hysterics!)\r\nDr. Channing once. It was a rare chance, as he does not now preach once\r\nin a year. His discourse was very beautiful--and oh, such a sermon as I\r\nheard from Father Taylor! I was almost disposed to say, \"surely never\r\nman spake like this man.\" And now good-bye. I must shut up the budget,\r\nand keep some for a rainy day. God bless my darling sisters. Love to\r\ndear Sam and Uncle. Your\r\n\r\n                                                           DUDIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these days also she first met her future husband.\r\n\r\nSamuel Gridley Howe was at this time (1842) forty-one years of age; his\r\nlife had been a stirring and adventurous one. After passing through\r\nBrown University, and the Harvard Medical School, in 1824 he threw in\r\nhis lot with the people of Greece, then engaged in their War of\r\nIndependence, and for six years shared their labor and hardships in the\r\nfield, and on shipboard, being surgeon-in-chief first to the Greek army,\r\nthen to the fleet. It was noted by a companion in arms, that \"the only\r\nfault found with him was that he always would be in the fight, and was\r\nonly a surgeon when the battle was over.\" He eventually found, however,\r\nthat his work was to be constructive, not destructive.\r\n\r\nThe people were perishing for lack of food; he returned to America,\r\npreached a crusade, and took back to Greece a shipload of food and\r\nclothing for the starving women and children. Having fed them, he set\r\nthem to work; built a hospital and a mole (which stands to this day in\r\nÆgina), founded a colony, and turned the half-naked peasants into\r\nfarmers. These matters have been fully related elsewhere.[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] _Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe._\r\n\r\nReturning to this country in 1831, he took up the education of the\r\nblind, which was to be chief among the multifarious labors of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen Julia Ward first met him, he had been for nine years Director of\r\nthe Perkins Institution for the Blind, and was known throughout the\r\ncivilized world as the man who had first taught language to a blind deaf\r\nmute (Laura Bridgman).\r\n\r\nUp to this time a person thus afflicted was classed with idiots,\r\n\"because,\" as Blackstone says, \"his mind cannot be reached.\" This dictum\r\nhad been recently reaffirmed by a body of learned men. Dr. Howe thought\r\notherwise. Briefly, he invented a new science. \"He carefully reasoned\r\nout every step of the way, and made a full and clear record of the\r\nmethods which he invented, not for his pupils alone, but for the whole\r\nafflicted class for which he opened the way to human fellowship.... His\r\nmethods have been employed in all subsequent cases, and after seventy\r\nyears of trial remain the standard.\"[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] _Memoir of Dr. Samuel G. Howe_, by Julia Ward Howe.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with Dorothea Dix, he was beginning the great fight for\r\nhelping and uplifting the insane; was already, with Horace Mann,\r\nconsidering the condition of the common schools, and forging the\r\nweapons for other fights which laid the foundations of the school system\r\nof Massachusetts. Later, he was to take up the cause of the\r\nfeeble-minded, the deaf mute, the prisoner, the slave; throughout his\r\nlife, no one in \"trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other\r\nadversity\" was ever to call on him in vain.\r\n\r\nHis friends called him the \"Chevalier\"; partly because the King of\r\nGreece had made him a Knight of St. George, but more because they saw in\r\nhim a good knight without fear and without reproach. Charles Sumner was\r\nhis _alter ego_, the brother of his heart; others of his intimates at\r\nthat time were Longfellow, George Hillard, Cornelius Felton, Henry\r\nCleveland. This little knot of friends called themselves \"The Five of\r\nClubs,\" and met often to make merry and to discuss the things of life.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1842 was spent by Julia Ward and her sisters at a cottage\r\nin the neighborhood of Boston, in company with their friend Mary\r\nWard.[20] Here Longfellow and Sumner often visited them, and here Julia\r\nfirst heard of the Chevalier and his wonderful achievement in educating\r\nLaura Bridgman. Deeply interested, she gladly accepted the offer of the\r\ntwo friends to drive her and her sisters over to the Perkins\r\nInstitution. She has described how \"Mr. Sumner, looking out of a window,\r\nsaid, 'Oh! here comes Howe on his black horse.' I looked out also, and\r\nbeheld a noble rider on a noble steed.\"\r\n\r\n  [20] Afterward Mrs. Charles H. Dorr. This lady was of no kin to them.\r\n  She had been betrothed to their brother Henry, and was the lifelong\r\n  friend of all three sisters.\r\n\r\nThe slender, military figure, the jet-black hair, keen blue eyes, and\r\nbrilliant complexion, above all the vivid presence, like the flash of a\r\nsword--all these could not fail to impress the young girl deeply; the\r\nChevalier, on his part, saw and recognized the _Diva Julia_ of his\r\nfriends' description. She has told us \"how acquaintance ripened into\r\ngood-will\" between the two.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier, eager to push the acquaintance further, went to New York\r\nto call on the Diva and her family. In a private journal of the time we\r\nfind the following glimpse of the pair:--\r\n\r\n\"Walked down Broadway with all the fashion and met the pretty\r\nblue-stocking, Miss Julia Ward, with her admirer, Dr. Howe, just home\r\nfrom Europe. She had on a blue satin cloak and a white muslin dress. I\r\nlooked to see if she had on blue stockings, but I think not. I suspect\r\nthat her stockings were pink, and she wore low slippers, as Grandmamma\r\ndoes. They say she dreams in Italian and quotes French verses. She sang\r\nvery prettily at a party last evening, and accompanied herself on the\r\npiano. I noticed how white her hands were.\"\r\n\r\nDuring a subsequent visit to Boston in the winter of 1842-43, Julia Ward\r\nand Dr. Howe became engaged. The engagement was warmly welcomed by the\r\nfriends of both.\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner writes to Julia:--\r\n\r\n\"Howe has told me, with eyes flashing with joy, that you have received\r\nhis love. May God make you happy in his heart, as I know he will be\r\nhappy in yours! A truer heart was never offered to woman. I know him\r\nwell. I know the depth, strength, and constancy of his affections, as\r\nthe whole world knows the beauty of his life and character. And oh! how\r\nI rejoice that these are all to mingle in loving harmony with your great\r\ngifts of heart and mind. God bless you! God bless you both! You will\r\nstrengthen each other for the duties of life; and the most beautiful\r\nhappiness shall be yours--that derived from inextinguishable mutual\r\nlove, and from the consciousness of duty done.\r\n\r\n\"You have accepted my dear Howe as your lover; pray let me ever be\r\n\r\n                        \"Your most affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n                                          \"CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. Sir Huldbrand has subdued the restless Undine, and the soul has\r\nbeen inspired into her; and her 'wickedness' shall cease.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLongfellow's letter to Dr. Howe also has been preserved among the\r\nprecious relics of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST CHEVALIER,--\r\n\r\nFrom the deepest dungeons of my heart, all the imprisoned sympathies and\r\naffections of my nature cry aloud to you, saying \"All hail!\" On my\r\nreturn from Portland this afternoon, I found your note, and before\r\nreading it I read in Sumner's eyes your happiness. The great riddle of\r\nlife is no longer a riddle to you; the great mystery is solved. I need\r\nnot say to you how very deeply and devoutly I rejoice with you; and no\r\none more so, I assure you. Among all your friends, I am the oldest\r\nfriend of your fair young bride; she is a beautiful spirit, a truth,\r\nwhich friendship has learned by heart in a few years. Love has taught\r\nyou in as many hours!\r\n\r\nOf course you seem to be transfigured and glorified. You walk above in\r\nthe June air, while Sumner and I, like the poor (sprites) in \"Faust,\"\r\nwho were struggling far down in the cracks and fissures of the rocks,\r\ncry out to you, \"O take us with you! take us with you!\"\r\n\r\nIn fine, my dear Doctor, God bless you and yours. You know already how\r\nmuch I approve your choice. I went to your office this afternoon to tell\r\nyou with my own lips; but you were not there. Take, therefore, this\r\nbrief expression of my happiness at knowing you are so happy; and\r\nbelieve me\r\n\r\n                                Ever sincerely your friend,\r\n\r\n                                                      LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, Feb. 20, 1843.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Diva writes to her brother Sam:--\r\n\r\n\"The Chevalier says truly--I am the captive of his bow and spear. His\r\ntrue devotion has won me from the world, and from myself. The past is\r\nalready fading from my sight; already, I begin to live with him in the\r\nfuture, which shall be as calmly bright as true love can make it. I am\r\nperfectly satisfied to sacrifice to one so noble and earnest the day\r\ndreams of my youth. He will make life more beautiful to me than a\r\ndream....\r\n\r\n\"The Chevalier is very presumptuous--says that he will not lose sight of\r\nme for one day, that I must stay here till he can return with me to New\r\nYork. The Chevalier is very impertinent, speaks of two or three months,\r\nwhen I speak of two or three years, and seems determined to have his\r\nown way: but, dear Bunny, the Chevalier's way will be a very charming\r\nway, and is, henceforth, to be mine.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not to be supposed that the Chevalier would wait longer for his\r\nbride than was absolutely necessary. The wedding preparations were\r\nhurried on, most of them being made by Sisters Annie and Louisa, as\r\nJulia could not be brought down from the clouds sufficiently to give\r\nthem much attention. It was hard even to make her choose her wedding\r\ndress; but this was finally decided upon, \"a white embroidered muslin,\r\nexquisitely fine, to be worn over a satin 'slip.'\"\r\n\r\nThe wedding, a quiet one, took place at Samuel Ward's house, on April\r\n23, 1843, and four days later, Chevalier and Diva sailed together for\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTRAVEL\r\n\r\n1843-1844; _aet._ 24-25\r\n\r\n                          ... I have been\r\n  In dangers of the sea and land, unscared;\r\n  And from the narrow gates of childbed oft\r\n  Have issued, bearing high my perilous prize\r\n  (The germ of angel-hood, from chaos rescued),\r\n  With steadfast hope and courage....\r\n\r\n                                            J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the forties it was no uncommon thing for a sister or friend of the\r\nbride to form one of the wedding party when a journey was to be taken;\r\naccordingly Annie Ward went with the Howes and shared the pleasures of a\r\nnotable year. She was at this time seventeen; it was said of her that\r\n\"she looked so like a lily-of-the-valley that one expected to see two\r\nlong green leaves spring up beside her as she walked.\"\r\n\r\nHorace Mann and his bride (Mary Peabody, sister of Mrs. Nathaniel\r\nHawthorne) sailed on the same steamer; the friends met afterward in\r\nLondon and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe first days at sea were rough and uncomfortable. Julia writes to her\r\nsister Louisa:--\r\n\r\n\"I have had two days of extreme suffering, and look like the Chevalier's\r\ngrandmother. To-day I am on deck, able to eat soup and herring, with\r\ngrog in small doses. Husband very kind, takes good care of me. I am good\r\nfor nothing, but try to be courageous. Mr. and Mrs. Mann are very\r\nloving; she wears a monstrous sunbonnet; he lies down in his\r\novercoat.... Brandy and water are consoling; Dr. won't give us much,\r\nthough.... I could not get off my boots until last night, I was so ill;\r\nI slept all the time, and forgot that Annie was on board.... When you do\r\nget married, don't leave in four days for Europe.... Don't forget cake\r\nfor my orphans.... Mrs. Mann wrote to me yesterday, and recommended\r\nlemonade. I wrote back to her, and recommended leeks and onions....\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, several days later:--\r\n\r\n\"Although the ship is very tipsy, and makes my head and hand unsteady, I\r\nam anxious to write to you that you may see what a brave sailor I am\r\nbecome, for to write at sea one must be quite well. I am ashamed to have\r\nwritten you so sea-sick a letter near Halifax, but I was then just out\r\nof my berth, and very miserable. Since that time, I have not once laid\r\nby--we have had some rough days, but I have always held up my head, and\r\neaten my dinner, 'helping myself _sang-froidy_' to all manner of good\r\nthings. At first, I could not do without brandy and water, but in a\r\nlittle while I ceased to require it; now I go tumbling about all over\r\nthe ship, singing at the top of my voice, teasing Chevalier, and\r\ncomforting the sea-sick.... I live on deck, rain or shine. Annie stays\r\ntoo much in the cabin, which is strewn with sick ladies, and grannies of\r\nthe other sex, and which ever resounds with cries of 'Mrs. Bean! Mrs.\r\nBean! soda water! Mrs. Bean, soup! Mrs. Bean, gruel with brandy in it!\r\nMrs. Bean, hold my head! Mrs. Bean, wag my jaws!' Mrs. Bean is the\r\nstewardess, and an angel....\r\n\r\n\"_Saturday morning._ We are now in sight of land, and in smooth\r\nwater.... Annie and I were getting very much used to the ship, and are\r\njust in fine trim for a long voyage. I even miss the rolling and\r\npitching which we have had until to-day, and which made it necessary to\r\nwalk with great circumspection. You would have laughed to have seen us,\r\ngoing about like tipsy witches. I have had various tumbles. I confess\r\nthat when the ship rolled and I felt myself going, I generally made for\r\nthe stoutest man in sight, and pitched into him, the result being\r\nvarious apologies on both sides, and great merriment on the part of the\r\nspectators--a little of the old mischief left, you see. The old cow\r\nbegan to smell the land yesterday, she reared and bellowed, and butted\r\nat the butcher when he went to milk her. This is her third voyage. I\r\ncannot tell you how good my husband is, how kind, how devoted....\"\r\n\r\nArriving in London, they took lodgings in upper Baker Street.\r\n\r\nThis first visit to London was one which our mother always loved to\r\nrecall. Not only had the pair brought letters to many notabilities, but\r\nDr. Howe's reputation had preceded him, and every reader of Dickens's\r\n\"American Notes\" was eager to meet the man who had brought a soul out of\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nJulia writes to her sister Louisa (June 17):--\r\n\r\n\"I have said something,--I can hardly say enough, of the kindness we\r\nhave received here. London seems already a home to us, and one\r\nsurrounded by dear friends. Morpeth and his family, Rogers, Basil\r\nMontagu, and Sir R. H. Inglis have been our best friends. Sydney Smith\r\nalso has been kind to us; he calls Howe 'Prometheus,' and says that he\r\ngave a soul to an inanimate body. For four mornings, we have not once\r\nbreakfasted at home. Milnes gave us one very nice breakfast; among the\r\nguests was Charles Buller, celebrated here for his wit and various\r\nendowments. The two handsomest women I have seen are Mrs. Norton and the\r\nDuchess of Sutherland--the former of these rather a haughty beauty, with\r\nflashing eye and swelling lip, and dress too low for our notions of\r\npropriety--this is common enough here....\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was lame (the result of an accident on shipboard), and the\r\nReverend Sydney Smith, one of their earliest visitors, insisted on\r\nlending him his own crutches. The Doctor demurred; he was tall, while\r\nCanon Smith was short and stout. The crutches were sent, nevertheless.\r\nThey could not be used, and were returned with thanks; not so soon,\r\nhowever, but that the kind and witty Canon made of the incident a peg on\r\nwhich to hang a jest. He had lost money by American investments; in a\r\nletter published in a London paper, after reflecting severely upon the\r\nfailure of some of the Western States to pay their debts, he added: \"And\r\nnow an American doctor has deprived me of my last means of support!\"\r\n\r\nSydney Smith proved genuinely kind and solicitous. He writes to the\r\nDoctor:--\r\n\r\n\"You know as well as I do, or better, that nature charges one hundred\r\nper cent for a bad leg used before the proper time, and that if you use\r\nit a day sooner than you ought, it may molest you for a month longer\r\nthan you expect. This being; [_sic_] if your ladies will trust\r\nthemselves to me any day, I shall have great pleasure in escorting them\r\nin their sight-seeing, and will call upon them with my carriage, if that\r\nbe possible.\"\r\n\r\nHe did take them about a great deal; they dined with him, and passed\r\nmore than one delightful evening at his house.\r\n\r\nAnother of their early visitors was Charles Dickens. Not only did he\r\ninvite them to dine, but he took them to all manner of places unfamiliar\r\nto the ordinary tourist: to prisons, workhouses, and asylums, more\r\ninteresting to the Chevalier than theatre or picture-gallery.\r\n\r\nThere were even expeditions to darker places, when Julia and Annie must\r\nstay at home. Dr. Howe's affair was with all sorts and conditions of\r\nmen, and the creator of Joe and Oliver Twist, the child of the\r\nMarshalsea, could show him things that no one else could. The following\r\nnote, in Dickens's unmistakable handwriting, shows how these expeditions\r\nwere managed, and how he enjoyed them:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOWE,--Drive to-night to St. Giles's Church. Be there at\r\nhalf-past 11--and wait. One of Tracey's people will put his head into\r\nthe coach after a Venetian and mysterious fashion, and breathe your\r\nname. Follow that man. Trust him to the death.\r\n\r\nSo no more at present from\r\n\r\n                                                        THE MASK.\r\n\r\nNinth June, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorace Mann was of the party on most of these investigations.\r\n\r\nBeside dinners and evening parties, there were breakfasts, with Richard\r\nMonckton Milnes (afterward Lord Houghton), with Samuel Rogers,--who gave\r\nthem plovers' eggs,--and with jovial Sir Robert Harry Inglis, who cut\r\nthe loaf at either end, giving the guests \"a slice or a hunch\" at their\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nThis meal, our mother notes, was not \"a luncheon in disguise,\" but a\r\ngenuine breakfast, at ten or even half-past nine o'clock.\r\n\r\nShe writes to her sister Louisa:--\r\n\r\n\"People have been very kind to us--we have one or two engagements for\r\nevery day this week, and had three dinners for one day, two of which we\r\nwere, of course, forced to decline. We had a pleasant dinner at\r\nDickens's, on Saturday--a very handsome entertainment, consisting of all\r\nmanner of good things. Dickens led me in to dinner--waxed quite genial\r\nover his wine, and was more natural than I ever saw him--after dinner we\r\nhad coffee, conversation and music, to which I lent my little wee voice!\r\nWe did not get home until half-past eleven.... Annie has doubtless told\r\nyou how we went to see Carlyle, and Mrs. was out, and I poured tea for\r\nhim, and he handed me the preserves with: 'I do not know what thae\r\nlittle things are, perhaps you can eat them--I never touch them mysel'.'\r\nThis naturally made me laugh--we had a strange but pleasant evening with\r\nhim--he is about forty, looks young for that, drinks powerful tea, and\r\nthen goes it strong upon all subjects, but without extravagance--he has\r\na fine head, an earnest face, a glowing eye.... Furthermore, we have\r\nwalked into the affections of the Hon. Basil Montagu, and Mrs.\r\nBasil--furthermore, Annie and I did went alone to a rout at Mrs. Sydney\r\nSmith's, and were announced, 'Mrs. 'Owe hand Miss Vord'--did not know a\r\nsoul, Annie frightened, I bored--got hold of some good people--made\r\nfriends, drank execrable tea, finished the evening by a crack with Sir\r\nSydney himself, and came off victorious, that is to say alive. Sir S.\r\nvery like old Mrs. Prime, three chins, and such a corporosity!...\r\n\r\n\"_Saturday, June 2nd._ We have been too busy to write. We dined on\r\nWednesday with Kenyon--present Dickens's wife, Fellows, Milnes and some\r\nothers--Milnes a pert little prig, but pleasant. _À propos_, when he\r\ncame to call upon us, our girl announced him as 'Mr. Miller'--our\r\nconversation ran upon literature, and I had the exquisite discrimination\r\nto tell him that except Wordsworth, there were no great poets in England\r\nnow. Fortunately he soon took his departure, and thus prevented me from\r\nexpressing the light estimation in which I hold his poetry. On Thursday\r\nMorpeth gave us a beautiful dinner--thirteen servants in the hall,\r\npowdered heads, Lady Carlisle very like Morpeth--Lady Mary Howard not\r\npretty; Duchess of Sutherland, beautiful, but like Lizzie Hogg. They\r\ngave us strawberries, the first we have tasted, green peas, pines,\r\npeaches, apricots, grapes--all very expensive. We stayed until nearly\r\ntwelve--they were very gracious--Annie and I are little people here--we\r\nare too young(?) to be noticed--we are very demure, and have learned\r\nhumility. Chev receives a great deal of attention, ladies press forward\r\nto look at him, roll up their eyes, and exclaim, 'Oh! he is such a\r\nwonner!' I do not like that the pretty women should pay him so many\r\ncompliments--it will turn his little head! He is now almost well, and so\r\nhandsome! the wrinkles are almost gone--Yesterday, Sir Robert Inglis gin\r\nus a treat in the shape of a breakfast--it was very pleasant, albeit Sir\r\nR. is very pious, and a Tory to boot. We had afterward a charming visit\r\nfrom Carlyle--in the evening we went to Landsdowne House, to a concert\r\ngiven by the Marquis--heard Grisi, Lablache, Mario, Standigl, were much\r\npleased--I was astonished, though, to find that our little trio at home\r\nwas not bad, even in comparison with these stars. They have, of course,\r\ninfinitely better voices, but hang me if they sing with half the\r\nenthusiasm and fire of our old Sam and Cousi, or even of poor Dudy.\r\nGrisi's voice is beautifully clear and flute-like--Mario sings\r\n_si-be-mol_ and natural with perfect ease. I was most interested in the\r\nGerman Standigl, who sang the '_Wanderer_' with wonderful pathos.\r\nLablache thundered away--I must see them on the stage before I shall be\r\nable to judge of them. After music we had supper. Willie Wad[21] was\r\nindefatigable in our service. 'Go, and bring us a great deal more\r\nlemonade!' these were our oft-repeated orders, and the good Geneseo\r\ntrotted to the table for us, till, as he expressed it, 'he was ashamed\r\nto go any more.' Lansdowne is a devilish good fellow! ho! ho! He wears a\r\nblue belt across his diaphragm, and a silver star on his left breast--he\r\njigs up and down the room, and makes himself at home in his own house.\r\nHe is about sixty, with Marchioness to match; side dishes, I presume,\r\nbut did not inquire. I have just been breakfasting at the Duke of\r\nSutherland's superb palace. I will tell you next time about it. Lady\r\nCarlisle says I am nice and pretty, oh! how I love her!...\"\r\n\r\n  [21] William Wadsworth, of Geneseo.\r\n\r\nIn another letter she says:--\r\n\r\n\"I take some interest in everything I see--especially in all that throws\r\nlight upon human prog. The Everetts[22] have given us a beautiful and\r\nmost agreeable dinner: Dickens, Mrs. Norton, Moore, Landseer, and one or\r\ntwo others. Rogers says: 'I have three pleasures in the day: the first\r\nis, when I get up in the morning, and scratch myself with my hair\r\nmittens; the second is when I dress for dinner, and scratch myself with\r\nmy hair mittens; the third is when I undress at night, and scratch\r\nmyself with my hair mittens.'...\"\r\n\r\n  [22] Edward Everett was at that time American Minister to England.\r\n\r\nBeside this feast of hospitality, there was the theatre, with Macready\r\nand Helen Faucit in the \"Lady of Lyons,\" and the opera, with Grisi and\r\nMario, Alboni and Persiani. Julia, who had been forbidden the theatre\r\nsince her seventh year, enjoyed to the full both music and drama, but\r\n\"the crowning ecstasy of all\" she found in the ballet, of which Fanny\r\nElssler and Cerito were the stars. The former was beginning to wane; the\r\ndancing which to Emerson and Margaret Fuller seemed \"poetry and\r\nreligion\" had lost, perhaps, something of its magic; the latter was\r\nstill in her early bloom and grace.\r\n\r\nYears later, our mother suggested to Theodore Parker that \"the best\r\nstage dancing gives the _classic, in a fluent form_, with the\r\nillumination of life and personality.\" She recalled nothing sensual or\r\neven sensuous in the dances she saw that season, only \"the very ecstasy\r\nand embodiment of grace.\" (But the Doctor thought Cerito ought to be\r\nsent to the House of Correction!)\r\n\r\nAmong the English friends, the one to whom our parents became most\r\nwarmly attached was Lord Morpeth, afterwards Earl of Carlisle. This\r\ngentleman proved a devoted friend. Not only did he show the travellers\r\nevery possible attention in London, but finding that they were planning\r\na tour through Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, he made out with great care\r\nan itinerary for them, giving the roads by which they should travel and\r\nthe points of interest they should visit.\r\n\r\nVery reluctantly they left the London of so many delights, and started\r\non the prescribed tour, following in the main the lines laid down by\r\ntheir kind friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\n                                                  Sunday, July 2.\r\n\r\n... We are in Dublin, among the Paddies, and funny enough they are.\r\nThere are many beggars--you cannot get into the carriage without being\r\nsurrounded with ragged women holding out their dirty hands, and\r\nclamouring for ha'pence--we have just returned from Edgeworthtown; on\r\nour way, we walked into some of the peasants' huts. I will tell you\r\nabout one--it was thatched, built very miserably, had no floor except\r\nthe native mud; there was a peat fire, which filled the house with\r\nsmoke--before the fire lay the pig, grunting in concert with the\r\nchickens, who were picking up scraps of the dinner, which consisted of\r\npotatoes and salt--three families live in it. Two sets of little\r\nragamuffins are sitting in the dirt. Ch. bestows some pence: \"God kape\r\nyour honour--God save ye, wherever ye go, and sure and it's a nice,\r\ncomfortable looking young woman you have got with you, an uncommon\r\npretty girl\" (that is me). Don't they understand the matter, eh? We\r\npassed three delightful hours with Miss Edgeworth, in the library in\r\nwhich she wrote all her works--she was surrounded by a numerous and\r\ncharming family, among others, the last of her father's four wives, whom\r\nshe calls mother, although the lady must be some ten years her junior.\r\nShe is herself a most vivacious little lady, about seventy-five years\r\nold, but gay and bright as a young girl--she seemed quite delighted with\r\nCh., and conversed with him on many topics in a very animated manner.\r\nShe has very clear and sound views of things, and takes the liveliest\r\ninterest in all that goes on around her, and in the world. One of her\r\nyounger brothers (with a nice Spanish wife) has a nest of very young\r\nchildren, in whom she delights as much as if she had not helped to bring\r\nup three sets of brothers and sisters. She said to me: \"It is not only\r\nfor Laura Bridgman that I wanted to see Dr. Howe, but I admire the\r\nspirit of all his writings.\" She gave him some engravings, and wrote her\r\nname at the bottom.... At one o'clock, we went to luncheon which was\r\nvery nice, consisting of meat, potatoes, and preserves.... She made us\r\nlaugh, and laughed herself. They were saying that American lard was\r\nquite superseding whale oil. \"Yes,\" said she, \"and in consequence, the\r\nwhale cannot bear the sight of a pig.\" Her little nephew made a real\r\nbull. He was showing me his rat trap, \"and,\" said he, \"I shall kill the\r\nrat before I let him out, eh?\"...\r\n\r\n_Dublin, Tuesday._ Went to the Repeal meeting at the Corn Exchange. It\r\nwas held in a small room in the third or fourth story. \"A shilling,\r\nsir,\" said the man at the door to my husband.--\"What!\" replied he, \"do\r\nladies pay?\"--\"Not unless they'd like to become repealers.\" We passed\r\nup--the gentlemen went on to the floor of the room--we went to the\r\nladies' gallery, a close confined place at one end--we were early, and\r\nhad good seats, for a time at least--we separated, not anticipating the\r\ntrouble we should have in finding each other again--for the ladies,\r\ncomprising orangewomen, washerwomen, and I fear, all manner of women,\r\npoured in, without much regard to order, decency, and the rights of\r\nprior possession--and when O'Connell came in, which was in about three\r\nquarters of an hour, they pressed, and pushed, and squeezed, and\r\nscolded, as only Irishwomen can do.... The current of female patriotism\r\nbore down upon me in a most painful manner--a sort of triangular\r\npressure seemed applied to my poor body which threatened to destroy, not\r\nonly my centre of gravity, but my very personal identity. I was obliged,\r\nI regret to say, to defend myself as I have sometimes done in a\r\nquadrille or waltzing circle in New York--I was forced to push in my\r\nturn, though as moderately as I could. This was not my only trouble--in\r\nthe crowd, I had scraped acquaintance with a respectable Irishwoman,\r\nwho, after various questions, discovered that I was an American, and\r\nimagined me at once to be a good Catholic and repealer--so when\r\nO'Connell made some allusions to the Americans, she said so as to be\r\nheard by several people, who immediately began to look at me with\r\ncurious eyes--\"You shouldn't disturb her, she's an American,\" and they\r\nwould for a time cease to molest me.... O'Connell was not great on this\r\noccasion--his remarks were rambling and superficial, distinguished\r\nchiefly by their familiarity, and by the extreme ingenuity with which\r\nthe cunning orator disguises the tendencies of the sentiments he\r\nvindicates, and talks treason, yet so that the law cannot lay a finger\r\nupon him. He had begun his speech when Steele, a brother repealer,\r\nentered. He stopped at once, held out his hand to him, saying in a loud\r\ntone, \"Tom Steele, how d'ye do?\" which drew forth bursts of applause.\r\n\"And is he a good man?\" I asked of a lady repealer (whether apple-woman\r\nor seller of ginger beer, I know not). \"Oh, Ma'am, he is the best\r\n_cratur_, the most charitable, the most virtuous, the most religious\r\nman--sure, he goes to the communion every Sunday, and never says no to\r\nno one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visit to Scotland was all too hasty, the notes are mere brief\r\njottings; at the end she \"remembered but one thing, the grave of Scott.\r\nIn return for all the delight he had given me, I had nothing to give him\r\nbut my silent tears.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of July found the party once more in England. The following\r\nletter tells of the unlucky visit to Wordsworth which our mother (after\r\nforty-six years) describes from memory in her \"Reminiscences\" in\r\nslightly different terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\n                                                         July 29.\r\n\r\n... I am very glad to be out of Ireland and Scotland, where we had\r\nincessant rains--even the beautiful Loch Katrine would not show herself\r\nto us in sunshine. We crossed in an open boat, and had a pony ride of\r\nfive miles, all in as abominable a drizzle as you would wish to see. The\r\nCumberland Lakes, among which we sought the shrine of Wordsworth, were\r\nalmost as unaccommodating--in driving to Windermere we got wetted to the\r\nskin, and dashed down the steep mountain road in a thick mist, with a\r\npair of horses, so unruly that I supposed the miseries of wet garments\r\nwould soon be cancelled by that of a broken neck. I prayed to Saint\r\nCrispin, Saint Nicholas, and the three kings of Köln, and got through\r\nthe danger--in the evening we visited Wordsworth, a crabbed old sinner,\r\nwho gave us a very indifferent muffin, and talked repudiation with Chev.\r\nAs he had just lost a great deal of money by Mississippi bonds, you may\r\nimagine that he felt particularly disposed to be cordial to\r\nAmericans--and not knowing, probably, that New York is not in the heart\r\nof Louisiana, he was inclined no doubt to cast part of the odium upon\r\nus. Accordingly Mrs. Wordsworth and her daughter sat at one end of the\r\nroom, Annie and I at the other. Incensed at this unusual neglect, I made\r\nseveral interjections in a low tone for Annie's benefit (my husband\r\nallows me to swear once a week)--at length, good Townsend-on-Mesmerism\r\ncame to my relief, and kindly talked with me for an hour or more--he is\r\na charming person, and rides other people's horses as well as his own\r\nhobby. He dislikes England, and lives principally in Germany. Kind\r\nHeaven, at the termination of the evening, sent me an opportunity of\r\nimparting a small portion of the internal pepper and mustard which had\r\nbeen ripening in my heart during the whole evening. The mother and\r\ndaughter beginning to whine to me about their losses, I told them that\r\nwhere one Englishman had suffered, twenty Americans were perhaps ruined.\r\nThey replied, it was hard they should suffer for the misfortunes of\r\nanother country. \"And why,\" quoth I, \"must you needs speculate in\r\nforeign stocks? Why did you not keep your money at home? It was safe\r\nenough in England--you knew there was risk in investing it so far from\r\nyou--if we should speculate in yours, we should no doubt be ruined\r\nalso.\" This explosion, from my meek self, took the company somewhat by\r\nsurprise--they held their tongues, and we departed....\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom England the travellers had meant to go to Berlin, but the King of\r\nPrussia, who eleven years before had kept Dr. Howe in prison _au secret_\r\nfor five weeks for carrying (at the request of General Lafayette) succor\r\nto certain Polish refugees, still regarded him as a dangerous person,\r\nand Prussia was closed to him and his. This greatly amused Horace Mann,\r\nwho wrote to the Doctor, \"I understand the King of Prussia has about\r\n200,000 men constantly under arms, and if necessary he can increase his\r\nforce to two millions. This shows the estimation in which he holds your\r\nsingle self!\"\r\n\r\nYears later, the King sent Dr. Howe a gold medal in consideration of his\r\nwork for the blind: by a singular coincidence, its money value was found\r\nto equal the sum which the Doctor had been forced to pay for board and\r\nlodging in the prison of Berlin.\r\n\r\nMaking a détour, the party journeyed through Switzerland and the\r\nAustrian Tyrol, spent some weeks in Vienna, and a month in Milan, where\r\nthey met Count Gonfalonieri, one of the prisoners of Spielberg. Julia\r\nhad known two of these sufferers, Foresti and Albinola, in New York,\r\nwhere they lived for many years, beloved and respected. Hearing the talk\r\nof these men, and seeing Italy bound hand and foot in temporal and\r\nspiritual fetters, she was deeply impressed by the apparent hopelessness\r\nof the outlook for the Italian patriots. By what miracle, she asked\r\nherself long afterward, was the great structure overthrown? She adds,\r\n\"The remembrance of this miracle forbids me to despair of any great\r\ndeliverance, desired and delayed. He who maketh the wrath of men to\r\nserve Him, can make liberty blossom out of the very rod that the tyrant\r\n[wields].\"\r\n\r\nSouthward still they journeyed, by _vettura_, in the old leisurely\r\nfashion, and came at last to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe thrill of wonder that Julia felt at the first sight of St. Peter's\r\ndome across the Campagna was one of the abiding impressions of her life;\r\nRome was to be one of the cities of her heart; the charm was cast upon\r\nher in that first moment. Yet she says of that Rome of 1843, \"A great\r\ngloom and silence hung over it.\"\r\n\r\nThe houses were cold, and there were few conveniences; but Christmas\r\nfound the Howes established in the Via San Niccolo da Tolentino, as\r\ncomfortably as might be. Here they were joined by Louisa Ward, and here\r\nthey soon gathered round them a delightful circle of friends. Most of\r\nthe _forestieri_ of Rome in those days were artists; among those who\r\ncame often to the house were Thomas Crawford, Luther Terry, Freeman the\r\npainter and his wife, and Törmer, who painted a portrait of Julia. The\r\nwinter passed like a dream. There were balls as gorgeous as those of\r\nLondon, with the beautiful Princess Torlonia in place of the Duchess of\r\nSutherland; musical parties, at which Diva sang to the admiration of\r\nall. There were visits to the galleries, where George Combe was of the\r\nparty, and where he and the Chevalier studied the heads of statues and\r\nbusts from the point of view of phrenology, a theory in which both were\r\ndeeply interested. They were presented to the Pope, Gregory XVI, who\r\nwished to hear about Laura Bridgman. The Chevalier visited all the\r\n\"public institutions, misnamed charitable,\"[23] and the schools, whose\r\nmasters were amazed to find that he was an American, and asked how in\r\nthat case it happened that he was not black!\r\n\r\n  [23] S. G. H. to Charles Sumner.\r\n\r\nIn her \"Reminiscences\" our mother records many vivid impressions of\r\nthese Roman days. She had forgotten, or did not care to recall, a\r\ncertain languor and depression of spirits which in some measure dimmed\r\nfor her the brightness of the picture, but which were to give place to\r\nthe highest joy she had yet known. On March 12, her first child was\r\nborn, and was christened Julia Romana.\r\n\r\nThere are neither journals nor letters of this period; the only record\r\nof it--from her hand--lies in two slender manuscript books of verse,\r\nmarked respectively \"1843\" and \"1844.\" In these volumes we trace her\r\nmovements, sometimes by the title of a poem, as \"Sailing,\" \"The Ladies\r\nof Llangollen,\" \"The Roman Beggar Boy,\" etc., sometimes by a single word\r\nwritten after the poem, \"Berne,\" \"Milan.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these poems we learn that she did not expect to survive the birth\r\nof her child; yet with that birth a new world opened before her.\r\n\r\n  He gave the Mother's chastened heart,\r\n  He gave the Mother's watchful eye,\r\n  He bids me live but where thou art,\r\n  And look with earnest prayer on high.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Then spake the angel of Mothers\r\n  To me in gentle tone:\r\n  \"Be kind to the children of others\r\n  And thus deserve thine own!\"\r\n\r\nWhen, in the spring of 1844, she left Rome with husband, sister, and\r\nbaby, it seemed, she says, \"like returning to the living world after a\r\nlong separation from it.\"\r\n\r\nJourneying by way of Naples, Marseilles, Avignon, they came at length to\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nHere Julia first saw Rachel, and Taglioni, the greatest of all dancers;\r\nhere, too, she tried to persuade the Chevalier to wear his Greek\r\ndecorations to Guizot's reception, but tried in vain, he considering\r\nsuch ornaments unfitting a republican.\r\n\r\nThe autumn found them again in England, this time to learn the delights\r\nof country visiting. Their first visit was to Atherstone, the seat of\r\nCharles Nolte Bracebridge, a descendant of Lady Godiva, a most\r\ncultivated and delightful man. He and his charming wife made the party\r\nwelcome, and showed them everything of interest except the family ghost,\r\nwhich remained invisible.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting visit was to the Nightingales of Embley. Florence\r\nNightingale was at this time a young woman of twenty-four. A warm\r\nfriendship sprang up between her and our parents, and she felt moved to\r\nconsult the Doctor on the matter which then chiefly occupied her\r\nthoughts. Would it, she asked, be unsuitable or unbecoming for a young\r\nEnglishwoman to devote herself to works of charity, in hospitals and\r\nelsewhere, as the Catholic Sisters did?\r\n\r\nThe Doctor replied: \"My dear Miss Florence, it would be unusual, and in\r\nEngland whatever is unusual is apt to be thought unsuitable; but I say\r\nto you, go forward, if you have a vocation for that way of life; act up\r\nto your inspiration, and you will find that there is never anything\r\nunbecoming or unladylike in doing your duty for the good of others.\r\nChoose your path, go on with it, wherever it may lead you, and God be\r\nwith you!\"\r\n\r\nAmong the people they met in the autumn of 1844 was Professor Fowler,\r\nthe phrenologist. This gentleman examined Julia's head, and made the\r\nfollowing pronunciamento:--\r\n\r\n\"You're a deep one! it takes a Yankee to find you out. The intellectual\r\ntemperament predominates in your character. You will be a central\r\ncharacter like Henry Clay and Silas Wright, and people will group\r\nthemselves around you.\"\r\n\r\nNow Julia could not abide Professor Fowler.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" she snapped out angrily. \"They've always been my models!\"\r\n\r\n\"The best things you do,\" he went on, \"will be done on the spur of the\r\nmoment. You have enough love of order to enjoy it, but you will not take\r\nthe trouble to produce it. You have more religion than morality. You\r\nhave genius, but no music in you by nature.\"\r\n\r\nFifty years later these words were fresh in her memory.\r\n\r\n\"I disliked Mr. Fowler extremely,\" she said, \"and believed nothing of\r\nwhat he said; nevertheless, most of his predictions were verified. I had\r\nat the time no leading in any of the directions he indicated. I had been\r\nmuch shut up in personal and family life; was a person rather of\r\nantipathies than sympathies. His remarks made _no impression_. Yet,\" she\r\nadded, \"I always had a sense of _relation to the public_, but thought\r\nthe connection would come through writing.\"\r\n\r\nApropos of Mr. Fowler's \"more religion than morality,\" she said:\r\n\"Morality is a thing of the will; we may think differently of such\r\nmatters at different times. What he said may have been true.\"\r\n\r\nThen the twinkle came into her eyes: \"When Mr. William Astor heard of my\r\nengagement, he said, 'Why, Miss Julia, I am surprised! I thought you\r\nwere too intellectual to marry!'\"\r\n\r\nAnother acquaintance of this autumn was the late Arthur Mills, who was\r\nthrough life one of our parents' most valued friends. He came to America\r\nwith them; in his honor, during the voyage, Julia composed \"The\r\nMilsiad,\" scribbling the lines day by day in a little note-book, still\r\ncarefully preserved in the Mills family.\r\n\r\nThe first and last stanzas give an idea of this poem, which, though\r\nnever printed, was always a favorite with its author.\r\n\r\n My heart fills\r\n With the bare thought of the illustrious Mills:\r\n That man of eyes and nose,\r\n Of legs and arms, of fingers and of toes.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n To lands devoid of tax\r\n Goeth he not, armed with axe?\r\n Trees shall he cut down,\r\n And forests ever?\r\n Tame cataracts with a frown?\r\n Grin all the fish from Mississippi River?\r\n     (My style is grandiose,\r\n     Quite in the tone of Mills's nose.)\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Harp of the West, through wind and foggy weather\r\n We've sung our passage to our native land,\r\n Now I have reached the terminus of tether,\r\n And I must lay thee trembling from my hand.\r\n That hand must ply the ignominious needle,\r\n This mind brood o'er the salutary dish,\r\n I must grow sober as a parish beadle,\r\n And having fish to fry, must fry my fish.\r\n Some happier muse than mine shall wake thy spell,\r\n Harp of the West, oh Gemini! farewell!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOUTH BOSTON\r\n\r\n1844-1851; _aet._ 25-32\r\n\r\nTHE ROUGH SKETCH\r\n\r\n  A great grieved heart, an iron will,\r\n  As fearless blood as ever ran;\r\n  A form elate with nervous strength\r\n  And fibrous vigor,--all a man.\r\n\r\n  A gallant rein, a restless spur,\r\n  The hand to wield a biting scourge;\r\n  Small patience for the tasks of Time,\r\n  Unmeasured power to speed and urge.\r\n\r\n  He rides the errands of the hour,\r\n  But sends no herald on his ways;\r\n  The world would thank the service done,\r\n  He cannot stay for gold or praise.\r\n\r\n  Not lavishly he casts abroad\r\n  The glances of an eye intense,\r\n  And did he smile but once a year,\r\n  It were a Christmas recompense.\r\n\r\n  I thank a poet for his name,\r\n  The \"Down of Darkness,\" this should be;\r\n  A child, who knows no risk it runs,\r\n  Might stroke its roughness harmlessly.\r\n\r\n  One helpful gift the Gods forgot,\r\n  Due to the man of lion-mood;\r\n  A Woman's soul, to match with his\r\n  In high resolve and hardihood.\r\n\r\n                                                         J. W. H.\r\n\r\n     The name of Laura Bridgman will long continue to suggest to the\r\n     hearer one of the most brilliant exploits of philanthropy, modern\r\n     or ancient. Much of the good that good men do soon passes out of\r\n     the remembrance of busy generations, each succeeding to each, with\r\n     its own special inheritance of labor and interest. But it will be\r\n     long before the world shall forget the courage and patience of the\r\n     man who, in the very bloom of his manhood, sat down to besiege this\r\n     almost impenetrable fortress of darkness and isolation, and, after\r\n     months of labor, carried within its walls the divine conquest of\r\n     life and of thought.\r\n\r\n                        J. W. H., _Memoir of Dr. Samuel G. Howe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1844, the travellers returned to America and took up their\r\nresidence at the Perkins Institution, in South Boston, in the apartment\r\nknown as the \"Doctor's Wing.\"\r\n\r\nAt first, Laura Bridgman made one of the family, the Doctor considering\r\nher almost as an adopted child. His marriage had been something of a\r\nshock to her.\r\n\r\n\"Does Doctor love me like Julia?\" she asked her teacher anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he love God like Julia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\nA pause: then--\"God was kind to give him his wife!\"\r\n\r\nShe and Julia became much attached to each other, and were friends\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\nJulia was now to realize fully the great change that had come in her\r\nlife. She had been the acknowledged queen of her home and circle in New\r\nYork. Up to this time, she had known Boston as a gay visitor knows it.\r\n\r\nShe came now as the wife of a man who had neither leisure nor\r\ninclination for \"_Society_\"; a man of tenderest heart, but of dominant\r\npersonality, accustomed to rule, and devoted to causes of which she knew\r\nonly by hearsay; moreover, so absorbed in work for these causes, that he\r\ncould only enjoy his home by snatches.\r\n\r\nShe herself says: \"The romance of charity easily interests the public.\r\nIts laborious details and duties repel and weary the many, and find\r\nfitting ministers only in a few spirits of rare and untiring\r\nbenevolence. Dr. Howe, after all the laurels and roses of victory, had\r\nto deal with the thorny ways of a profession tedious, difficult, and\r\nexceptional. He was obliged to create his own working machinery, to\r\ndrill and instruct his corps of teachers, himself first learning the\r\nsecrets of the desired instruction. He was also obliged to keep the\r\ninfant Institution fresh in the interest and goodwill of the public, and\r\nto give it a place among the recognized benefactions of the\r\nCommonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the bright little world of old New York, from relatives and\r\nfriends, music and laughter, fun and frolic, she came to live in an\r\nInstitution, a bleak, lofty house set on a hill, four-square to all the\r\nwinds that blew; with high-studded rooms, cold halls paved with white\r\nand gray marble, echoing galleries; where three fourths of the inmates\r\nwere blind, and the remaining fourth were devoting their time and\r\nenergies to the blind. The Institution was two miles from Boston, where\r\nthe friends of her girlhood lived: an unattractive district stretched\r\nbetween, traversed once in two hours by omnibuses, the only means of\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nAgain, her life had been singularly free from responsibility. First her\r\nAunt Francis, then her sister Louisa, had \"kept house\" in Bond Street;\r\nJulia had been a flower of the field, taking no thought for food or\r\nraiment; her sisters chose and bought her clothes, had her dresses made,\r\nand put them on her. Her studies, her music, her dreams, her\r\ncompositions--and, it must be added, her suitors--made the world in\r\nwhich she lived. Now, life in its most concrete forms pressed upon her.\r\nThe baby must be fed at regular intervals, and she must feed it; there\r\nmust be three meals a day, and she must provide them; servants must be\r\nengaged, trained, directed, and all this she must do. Her thoughts\r\nsoared heavenward; but now there was a string attached to them, and they\r\nmust be pulled down to attend to the leg of mutton and the baby's cloak.\r\n\r\nThis is one side of the picture; the other is different, indeed.\r\n\r\nHer girlhood had been shut in by locks and bars of Calvinistic piety;\r\nher friends and family were ready to laugh, to weep, to pray with her;\r\nthey were not ready to think with her. It is true that surrounding this\r\nintimate circle was a wider one, where her mind found stimulus in\r\ncertain directions. She studied German with Dr. Cogswell; she read Dante\r\nwith Felice Foresti, the Italian patriot; French, Latin, music, she had\r\nthem all. Her mind expanded, but her spiritual growth dates from her\r\nearly visits to Boston.\r\n\r\nThese visits had not been given wholly to gayety, even in the days when\r\nshe wrote, after a ball: \"I have been through the burning, fiery\r\nfurnace, and it is Sad-rake, Me-sick, and Abed-no-go!\" The friends she\r\nmade, both men and women, were people alive and awake, seeking new\r\nlight, and finding it on every hand. Moreover, at her side was now one\r\nof the torch-bearers of humanity, a spirit burning with a clear flame of\r\nfervor and resolve, lighting the dark places of the earth. Her mind,\r\nunder the stimulus of these influences, opened like a flower; she too\r\nbecame one of the seekers for light, and in her turn one of the\r\nlight-bringers.\r\n\r\nAmong the poems of her early married life, none is more illuminating\r\nthan the portrait of Dr. Howe, which heads this chapter. The concluding\r\nstanza gives a hint of the depression which accompanied her first\r\nrealization of the driving power of his life, of the white-hot metal of\r\nhis nature. She was caught up as it were in the wake of a comet, and\r\nwhirled into new and strange orbits: what wonder that for a time she was\r\nbewildered? She had no thought, when writing \"The Rough Sketch,\" that a\r\nlater day was to find her soul indeed matched with his, \"in high resolve\r\nand hardihood\": that through her lips, as well as his, God was to sound\r\nforth a trumpet that should never call retreat.\r\n\r\nIn her normal health she was a person of abounding vitality, with a\r\nconstitution of iron: as is common with such temperaments, she felt a\r\nphysical distaste to the abnormal and defective. It required in those\r\ndays all the strength of her will to overcome her natural shrinking from\r\nthe blind and the other defectives with whom she was often thrown. There\r\nis no clearer evidence of the development of her nature than the\r\ncontrast between this mental attitude and the deep tenderness which she\r\nfelt in her later years for the blind. After the Doctor's death, they\r\nbecame her cherished friends; she could never do enough for them; with\r\nevery year her desire to visit the Perkins Institution, to talk with the\r\npupils, to give them all she had to give, grew stronger and more lively.\r\n\r\nOf the friends of this time, none had so deep and lasting an influence\r\nover her as Theodore Parker, who had long been a close friend of the\r\nDoctor's. She had first heard of him in her girlhood, as an impious and\r\nsacrilegious person, to be shunned by all good Christians.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 she met him in Rome, and found him \"one of the most sympathetic\r\nand delightful of men\"; an intimacy sprang up between the two families\r\nwhich ended only with Parker's life. He baptized the baby Julia; on\r\nreturning to this country, she and the Doctor went regularly to hear him\r\npreach. This she always considered as among the great opportunities of\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot remember,\" she says, \"that the interest of his sermons ever\r\nvaried for me. It was all one intense delight.... It was hard to go out\r\nfrom his presence, all aglow with the enthusiasm which he felt and\r\ninspired, and to hear him spoken of as a teacher of irreligion, a pest\r\nto the community.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the days when it was possible for a minister of a Christian\r\nchurch, hearing of Parker's dangerous illness, to pray that God might\r\nremove him from the earth. To her, it seemed that \"truly, he talked with\r\nGod, and took us with him into the divine presence.\"\r\n\r\nParker could play as well as preach; she loved to \"make fun\" with him.\r\nWitness her \"Philosoph-Master and Poet-Aster\" in \"Passion Flowers.\"\r\nParker's own powers of merrymaking appear in his Latin epitaph on \"the\r\nDoctor\" (who survived him by many years), which is printed in the\r\n\"Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe.\"\r\n\r\nShe used in later years to shake her head as she recalled a naughty\r\n_mot_ of hers apropos of Parker's preaching: \"I would rather,\" she said,\r\n\"hear Theodore Parker preach than go to the theatre; I would rather go\r\nto the theatre than go to a party; I would rather go to a party than\r\nstay at home!\"\r\n\r\nA letter to her sister Annie shows the trend of her religious thought in\r\nthese days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Sunday evening, December 8, 1844.\r\n\r\nDEAR ANNIE,--\r\n\r\nDo not let the Bishop or Uncle or any one frighten you into any\r\nconcessions--tell them, and all others that, even if you agree with them\r\nin doctrine, you think their notion of a religious life narrow, false,\r\nsuperficial. You owe it to truth, to them, to yourself, to say so. I\r\nthink perfect and fearless frankness one of our highest duties to _man_\r\nas well as to God. Only see how one half the world pragmatically sets\r\nits foot down, and says to the other half, \"Be converted, my opinion is\r\ntruth! I must be right and you must be wrong,\"--while the other half\r\ntimidly falters a reluctant acquiescence, or scarce audible expression\r\nof doubt, and continues troubled and afraid and discontented with itself\r\nand others. Let me never think of you as in this ignominious position,\r\ndear Annie. Do not think that I misapprehend you. I know you do not\r\nagree in doctrine with me, but I know too that you do not feel that you\r\ncan abandon your life and conscience to the charge and guidance of such\r\na man as Eastburn, or as Uncle Ben. Do not, therefore, be afraid of\r\nthem, but let their censure be a very secondary thing with you--while\r\nyour life is the true expression of your faith, whom can you fear? You\r\nare accountable to man for the performance of the duties which affect\r\nhis welfare and well-being--for those which concern your own soul, you\r\nare accountable to God alone. A man, though with twenty surplices on his\r\nback and twenty prayer books in his hand, can no more condemn than he\r\ncan save you.... There may be a hell and a heaven, and it may be good\r\nfor most people, for you and me, too, if you choose to think that it is\r\nso. But there is a virtue which rises above such considerations--there\r\nare motives higher than personal fear or hope--the love of good because\r\nit is good, because it is God's and nature's law, because it is the\r\nsecret of the beautiful order of things, because they are blessed by\r\nyour virtuous deeds and pure thoughts--because every holy, every noble\r\ndeed, word, or thought helps to build up the ruins of the world, and to\r\nelevate our degraded humanity. Those who propose to you hell and heaven\r\nas the great incentives to right, appeal merely to your natural love of\r\npersonal advantage--those who hold up to you a God now frowning and\r\nindignant, now gracious and benignant, appeal simply to your natural\r\ncowardice, to your natural love of approbation. Does one love God for\r\none's own advantage? One loves Him for His perfection, and if one loves\r\nHim, one keeps His commandments. Abandon, I pray you, the exploded\r\nformula of selfishness!... I think one should be capable of loving\r\nvirtue, were one sure even that hell and not heaven would be its\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nThe benedictions of the Sermon on the Mount are very simple--no\r\nraptures, no ecstasies are promised. Blessed are all that seek the good\r\nof others and the knowledge of truth--blessed, simply that in so doing\r\nthey obey the law of God, imitate His character, and coming nearer and\r\nnearer to Him shall find Him more and more in their hearts. One word\r\nabout Unitarians. It is very wrong to say that they reject the Bible,\r\nsimply because they interpret it in a different manner from the\r\n(so-called) orthodox, or that they reject Christ, because they\r\nunderstand him in one way, and you in another--while they emulate his\r\nwonderful life, while they acknowledge his divine mission, and the\r\ndivine power of his words, why should they be said to despise him?...\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the years between 1843 and 1859, her life was from time to time\r\nshadowed by the approach of a great joy. Before the birth of each\r\nsuccessive child she was oppressed by a deep and persistent melancholy.\r\nPresent and future alike seemed dark to her; she wept for herself, but\r\nstill more for the hapless infant which must come to birth in so\r\nsorrowful a world. With the birth of the child the cloud lifted and\r\nvanished. Sunshine and joy--and the baby--filled the world; the mother\r\nsang, laughed, and made merry.\r\n\r\nIn her letters to her sisters, and later in her journals, both these\r\nmoods are abundantly evident. At first, these letters are full of the\r\nbustle of arrival and of settling in the Institution.\r\n\r\n\"I received the silver.... The soup-ladle is my delight, and I could\r\nalmost take the dear old coffee-pot to bed with me.... But here is the\r\nmost important thing.\r\n\r\n\"MY TRAGEDY IS LEFT BEHIND!... My house ... in great confusion, carpets\r\nnot down, curtains not up, the devil to pay, and not a sofa to ask him\r\nto sit down upon....\"\r\n\r\nShe now felt sadly the need of training in matters which her girlhood\r\nhad despised. (She could describe every room in her father's house save\r\none--the kitchen!) The Doctor liked to give weekly dinners to his\r\nintimates, \"The Five of Clubs,\" and others. These dinners were something\r\nof a nightmare to Julia, even with the aid of Miss Catherine Beecher's\r\ncookbook. She spent weeks in studying this volume and trying her hand on\r\nits recipes. This was not what her hand was made for; yet she learned to\r\nmake puddings, and was proud of her preserves.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the dinner parties, she tells of one for which she had taken\r\nspecial pains, and of which ice-cream, not then the food of every day,\r\nwas to form the climax. The ice-cream did not come, and her pleasure was\r\nspoiled; she found it next morning in a snowbank outside the back door,\r\nwhere the messenger had \"dumped\" it without word or comment. \"I should\r\nlaugh at it now,\" she says, \"but then I almost wept over it.\"\r\n\r\nEverything in the new life interested her, even the most prosaic\r\ndetails. She writes to her sister Louisa:\r\n\r\n\"Our house has been enlivened of late by two delightful visits. The\r\nfirst was from the soap-fat merchant, who gave me thirty-four pounds of\r\ngood soap for my grease. I was quite beside myself with joy, capered\r\nabout in the most enthusiastic manner, and was going to hug in turn the\r\nsoap, the grease, and the man, had I not remembered my future\r\nambassadress-ship, and reflected that it would not sound well in\r\nhistory. This morning came the rag-man, who takes rags and gives nice\r\ntin vessels in exchange.... Both of these were clever transactions. Oh,\r\nif you had seen me stand by the soap-fat man, and scrutinize minutely\r\nhis weights and measures, telling him again and again that it was\r\nbeautiful grease, and he must allow me a good price for it--truly, I am\r\na mother in Israel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch as the Doctor loved the Perkins Institution, he longed for a home\r\nof his own, and in the spring of 1845 he found a place entirely to his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nA few steps from the Institution was a plot of land, facing the sun,\r\nsheltered from the north wind by the last remaining bit of \"Washington\r\nHeights,\" the eminence on which Washington planted the batteries which\r\ndrove the British out of Boston. Some six acres of fertile ground, an\r\nold house with low, broad, sunny rooms, two towering Balm of Gilead\r\ntrees, and some ancient fruit trees: this was all in the beginning; but\r\nthe Doctor saw at a glance the possibilities of the place. He bought it,\r\nadded one or two rooms to the old house, planted fruit trees, laid out\r\nflower gardens, and in the summer of 1845 moved his little family\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nThe move was made on a lovely summer day. As our mother drove into the\r\ngreen bower, half shade, half sunshine, silent save for the birds, she\r\ncried out, \"Oh! this is green peace!\" The name fitted and clung: \"_Green\r\nPeace_\" was known and loved as such so long as it existed.\r\n\r\nThis was the principal home of her married life, but it was not\r\nprecisely an abiding one. The summers were spent elsewhere; moreover,\r\nthe \"Doctor's Wing\" in the Institution was always ready for habitation,\r\nand it often happened that for one reason or another the family were\r\ntaken back there for weeks or months. Two of the six children, Florence\r\nand Maud, were born at the Institution; the former just before the move\r\nto Green Peace. She was named Florence in honor of Miss Nightingale. The\r\nDoctor had ardently desired a son; finding the baby a girl, \"I will\r\nforgive you,\" he cried, \"if you will name her for Florence Nightingale!\"\r\nMiss Nightingale became the child's godmother, sent a golden cup (now a\r\nprecious heirloom), and wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             EMBLEY, December 26.\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend to express, my dear kind friends, how touched and\r\npleased I was by such a remembrance of me as that of your child's\r\nname.... If I could live to justify your opinion of me, it would have\r\nbeen enough to have lived for, and such thoughts, as that of your\r\ngoodness, are great thoughts, \"strong to consume small troubles\" which\r\nshould bear us up on the wings of the Eagle, like Guido's Ganymede, up\r\nto the feet of the God, there to take what work he has for us to do for\r\nhim. I shall hope to see my little Florence before long in this world,\r\nbut if not, I trust there is a tie formed between us, which shall\r\ncontinue in Eternity--if she is like you, I shall know her again there,\r\nwithout her body on, perhaps the better for not having known her here\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters to her sisters give glimpses of the life at Green Peace during\r\nthe years 1845-50.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\n... I assure you it is a delightful but a terrible thing to be a mother.\r\nThe constant care, anxiety and thought of some possible evil that may\r\ncome to the little creature, too precious to be so frail, whose life and\r\nwell-being the mother feels God has almost placed in her hands! If I did\r\nnot think that angels watched over my baby, I should be crazy about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _To the same_\r\n\r\nMy trouble has been Chev's illness.... He was taken ill the night of his\r\nreturn, and established himself next morning on the sofa, to be coddled\r\nwith Cologne, and dieted with peaches and grapes, when lo, in an hour\r\nmore, no coddling save that of (Dr.) Fisher, no _diet_ save ipecac and\r\nwerry thin gruel--chills, nausea, and blue devils. Bradford to watch by\r\nnight, Rosy and I by day; Fisher and I sympathizing deeply in holding\r\nthe head of a perfectabilian philanthropist. I making myself active in a\r\nvariety of ways, bathing Chev's eyes with cologne water by mistake\r\ninstead of his brow, laying the pillow the wrong way, and being\r\nbanished at last in disgrace, to make room for Rosa.\r\n\r\nAm I not the most unfortunate of human beings? Devil a bit! I enjoy all\r\nthat I can--have I not milk for the baby, and the baby for milk? Cannot\r\nJulia make arrowroot pudding and cold custard? Can I not refresh myself\r\nby looking into Romana's sapphire eyes, with their deep dark fringe? Is\r\nthere no balm in Gilead, is there no physician there? Yea, thou, oh\r\nBradford, art the balm, thou, oh Fisher, art the physician! Food also is\r\nthere for cachinnation, that chief duty of man--Quoth Chev this morning,\r\nlifting up his feeble voice and shaking his dizzy head: \"Oh, oh, if I\r\nhad fallen sick in New York, and old Francis had bled me, you would not\r\nhave seen me again....\"\r\n\r\nFlorence's name is Florence Marion--pretty, _n'est-ce pas?_...\r\n\r\n                              Farewell, my own darling. Your\r\n                                                           JULES.\r\n\r\nWell, life _am_ strange! I am again cookless. I imprudently turned old\r\nSmith off and took a young girl, who left me in four days. Why? Her\r\nlover would not allow her to stay in a family where she did not sit at\r\ntable with the lady. I had read of such things in Mrs. Trollope, and\r\nthought them quite impossible. In the place from which I took her, she\r\nhad done all the cooking, washing and chamber work of the house--was, in\r\nfine the only servant, for the compensation of six dollars a month. But\r\nthen, she sat at table!!! oh, ho!\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                    SOUTH BOSTON, April 21, 1845.\r\n\r\n... The weather here is so gloomy, that one really deserves credit for\r\nnot hanging oneself!... I passed last evening with ----. Chev was going\r\nto a \"'versary,\" left me there at about seven, and did not come for me\r\nuntil after ten. Consequence was, I got heartily tired of the whole\r\nfamily, and concluded that bright people without hearts were in the long\r\nrun less agreeable than good gentle people without wits--glory on my\r\nsoul, likewise also on my baby's soul, which I am!\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _To the same_[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] Louisa Ward married Thomas Crawford in 1844, and lived thereafter\r\n  in Rome.\r\n\r\n                                    SOUTH BOSTON, November, 1845.\r\n\r\nMY DARLING WEVIE,--\r\n\r\nThe children have been so very obliging as to go to sleep, and having\r\nworried over them all day, and part of the evening, I will endeavor to\r\ngive you what is left of it. When you become the mother of two children\r\nyou will understand the value of time as you never understood it before.\r\nMy days and nights are pretty much divided between Julia and Florence. I\r\nsleep with the baby, nurse her all night, get up, hurry through my\r\nbreakfast, take care of her while Emily gets hers, then wash and dress\r\nher, put her to sleep, drag her out in the wagon, amuse Dudie, kiss,\r\nlove and scold her, etc., etc.... Oh, my dear Wevie, for one good\r\nsqueeze in your loving arms, for one kiss, and one smile from you, what\r\nwould I not give? Anything, even my box of Paris finery, which I have\r\njust opened, with great edification. Oh, what headdresses! what silks!\r\nwhat a bonnet, what a mantelet! I clapped my hands and cried glory for\r\nthe space of half an hour, then danced a few Polkas around the study\r\ntable, then sat down and felt happy, then remembered that I had now\r\nnothing to do save to grow old and ugly, and so turned a misanthropic\r\nlook upon the Marie Stuart garland, etc., etc. You have certainly chosen\r\nmy things with your own perfect taste. The flowers and dresses are alike\r\nexquisite, and so are all the things, not forgetting Dudie's little\r\ndarling bonnet. But I fear that even this beautiful toilette will hardly\r\ntempt me from my nursery fireside where my presence is, in these days,\r\nindispensable. I have not been ten minutes this whole day, without\r\nholding one or other of the children. I have to sit with Fo-fo on one\r\nknee and Dudie on the other, trotting them alternately, and singing,\r\n\"Jim along Josie,\" till I can't Jim along any further possibly. Well,\r\nlife is peculiar anyhow. Dudie doesn't go alone yet--heaven only knows\r\nwhen she will. _Sunday evening._ I wore the new bonnet and mantelet to\r\nchurch, to-day:--frightened the sexton, made the minister squint, and\r\nthe congregation stare. It looked rather like a green clam shell, some\r\nfolks thought. I did not. I cocked it as high as ever I could, but\r\nsomehow it did plague me a little. I shall soon get used to it. Sumner\r\nhas been dining with us, and he and Chev have been pitying unmarried\r\nwomen. Oh, my dear friends, thought I, if you could only have one baby,\r\nyou would change your tune.... Heaven grant that your dear little child\r\nmay arrive safely, and gladden your heart with its sweet face. What a\r\nnew world will its birth open to you, an ocean of love unfathomed even\r\nby your loving heart. I cannot tell you the comfort I have in my little\r\nones, troublesome as they sometimes are. However weary I may be at\r\nnight, it is sweet to feel that I have devoted the day to them. I am\r\nbecome quite an adept in washing and dressing, and curl my little\r\nFo-fo's hair beautifully. Tell Donald that I can even wash out the\r\nlittle crease in her back, without rubbing the skin off....\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _To her sister Annie_[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] Before the marriage of the latter to Adolphe Mailliard.\r\n\r\n                                                            1846.\r\n\r\nMy poor dear little Ante-nuptial, I will write to you, and I will come\r\nto you, though I can do you no good--sentiment and sympathy I have none,\r\nbut such insipidity as I have give I unto thee.... Dear Annie, your\r\nmarriage is to me a grave and solemn matter. I hardly allow myself to\r\nthink about it. God give you all happiness, dearest child. Some\r\nsufferings and trials I fear you must have, for after all, the entering\r\ninto single combat, hand to hand, with the realities of life, will be\r\nstrange and painful to one who has hitherto lived, enjoyed, and\r\nsuffered, _en l'air_, as you have done.... To be happily married seems\r\nto me the best thing for a woman. Oh! my sweet Annie, may you be\r\nhappy--your maidenhood has been pure, sinless, loving, beautiful--you\r\nhave no remorses, no anxious thought about the past. You have lived to\r\nmake the earth more beautiful and bright--may your married life be as\r\nholy and harmless--may it be more complete, and more acceptable to God\r\nthan your single life could possibly have been. Marriage, like death, is\r\na debt we owe to nature, and though it costs us something to pay it, yet\r\nare we more content and better _established_ in peace, when we have paid\r\nit. A young girl is a loose flower or flower seed, blown about by the\r\nwind, it may be cruelly battered, may be utterly blighted and lost to\r\nthis world, but the matron is the same flower or seed planted, springing\r\nup and bearing fruit unto eternal life. What a comfort would Wevie now\r\nbe to you--she is so much more _loving_ than I, but thee knows I try. I\r\nhave been better lately, the quiet nights seem to speak to me again, and\r\nto quicken my dead soul. What I feel is a premature _old age_, caused by\r\nthe strong passions and conflicts of my early life. It is the languor\r\nand indifference of old age, without its wisdom, or its well-earned\r\nright to repose. Sweetie, wasn't the bonnet letter hideous? I sent it\r\nthat you might see how _naughty I could be_....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Doctor's health had been affected by the hardships and exposures of\r\nhis service in the Greek Revolution, and his arduous labors now gave him\r\nlittle time for rest or recuperation. He was subject to agonizing\r\nheadaches, each of which was a brief but distressing illness. In the\r\nsummer of 1846 he resolved to try the water cure, then considered by\r\nmany a sovereign remedy for all human ailments, and he and our mother\r\nspent some delightful weeks at Brattleboro, Vermont.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\n                                                  August 4, 1846.\r\n\r\nDEAREST WEVIE,--\r\n\r\n... We left dear old Brattleboro on Sunday afternoon, at five o'clock,\r\nserenely packed in our little carriage; the good old boarding-house\r\nwoman kissed me, and presented me with a bundle, containing cake,\r\nbiscuits, and whortleberries.... Two calico bags, one big and one\r\nlittle, contained our baggage for the journey. Chev and I felt well and\r\nhappy, the children were good, the horses went like birds, and showed\r\nthemselves horses of good mettle, by carrying us over a distance of one\r\nhundred miles in something less than two days, for we arrived here at\r\nthree o'clock to-day, so that the second 24 hours was not completed.\r\nVery pleasant was our little journey. We started very early each\r\nmorning, and went ten or twelve miles to becassim;[26] the country inns\r\nwere clean, quiet and funny. We had custards, pickles, and pies for\r\nbreakfast, and tea at dinner. Oh, it was a good time! At Athol, I found\r\na piano, and sat down to sing negro songs for the children. A charming\r\naudience, comprising cook, ostler, and waiter, collected around the\r\nparlour door, and encouraged me with a broom and a pitchfork. Well, it\r\nwas pleasant to arrive at our dear Green Peace, or Villa Julia, as they\r\ncall it. We found everything in beautiful order, the green corn grown as\r\nhigh as our heads, and ripe enough to eat, the turkey sitting on eleven\r\neggs, the peahen on four, six young turkeys already growing up, and two\r\nbroods of young chickens.\r\n\r\n  [26] Breakfast.\r\n\r\nPeas, tomatoes, beans, squashes and potatoes, all flourishing. Our\r\ngarden entirely supplies us with vegetables, and we shall have many\r\napples and pears. Immediately upon my arrival, I found the box and\r\nlittle parcel from you. You may imagine the pleasure it gave me to\r\nreceive, at this distance, things which your tasteful little fingers had\r\nworked.... I am rather ashamed to see how beautiful your work is, when\r\nmine is as coarse as possible. In truth, I am a clumsy seamstress, but I\r\nmake good puddings, and the little things I make do well enough here in\r\nthe country.... _August 15th._ I have passed eleven quiet and peaceful\r\ndays since I got so far with my letter. My chicks have been good, and my\r\nhusband well. My household affairs go on very pleasantly and easily\r\nnowadays. My good stout German girl takes care of the chicks and helps a\r\nlittle with the chamber work. My little Lizzie does the cooking, all but\r\nthe puddings which I always make myself, so I keep but two house\r\nservants. The man takes care of the horses, drives and keeps the garden\r\nin excellent order. I make my bed and put my room in order as well as I\r\ncan. I generally wipe the dishes when Lizzie has washed them, so you see\r\nthat I am quite an industrious flea. I have made very nice raspberry jam\r\nand currant jelly with my own hands.... Felton came to tea last evening.\r\nHe was pleasant and bright. He will be married some time in November.\r\nHillard, too, has been to see me. Yesterday was made famous by the\r\npurchase of a very beautiful piano of Chickering's manufacture. The\r\nvalue of it was $450, but the kind Chick sold it to us at wholesale\r\nprice. It arrived at Green Peace to-day, and has already gladdened the\r\nchildren's hearts by some gay tunes, the rags of my antiquated musical\r\nrepertory. You will be glad, I am sure, to know that I have one at last,\r\nfor I have been many months without any instrument, so that I have\r\nalmost forgotten how to touch one.... My mourning [for a sister-in-law]\r\nhas been quite an inconvenience to me, this summer. I had just spent all\r\nthe money I could afford for my summer clothes, and was forced to spend\r\n$30 more for black dresses.... The black clothes, however, seem to me\r\nvery idle things, and I shall leave word in my will that no one shall\r\nwear them for me....\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                        BORDENTOWN, August, 1846.\r\n\r\n... Sumner and Chev came hither with us, and passed two days and nights\r\nhere. Chev is well and good. Sumner is as usual, funny but very good and\r\nkind. Philanthropy goes ahead, and slavery will be abolished, and so\r\nshall we. New York is full of engagements in which I feel no interest.\r\nJohn Astor and Augusta Gibbs are engaged, and are, I think, fairly well\r\nmatched. One can only say that each is good enough for the other.\r\n\r\nThese were the days when Julia sang in her nursery:\r\n\r\n  \"Rero, rero, riddlety rad,\r\n  This morning my baby caught sight of her Dad,\r\n  Quoth she, 'Oh, Daddy, where have you been?'\r\n  'With Mann and Sumner a-putting down sin!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To her sister Annie_\r\n\r\n                                                 August 17, 1846.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARLING ANNIE,--\r\n\r\n... After seeing the frugal manner in which country people live, and\r\nafter deriving great benefit from hydropathic diet, Chev and I thought\r\nwe could get along with one servant less, and so we have no cook.\r\nLizzie[27] cooks, I make the pudding, we have no tea, and live\r\nprincipally upon vegetables from our own garden, hasty pudding, etc. I\r\nmake the beds and do the rooms, as well as I can. We get along quite\r\ncomfortably, and I like it very much--the fewer servants one has, the\r\nmore comfort, I think.... I have plenty of occupation for my fingers. My\r\nheart will be much taken up with my babies; as for my soul, that part of\r\nme which thinks and believes and imagines, I shall leave it alone till\r\nthe next world, for I see it has little to do in this....\r\n\r\n                                      Good-bye. Your own, own\r\n\r\n                                                           DUDIE.\r\n\r\n  [27] The nurserymaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\n                                        BOSTON, December 1, 1846.\r\n\r\nDearest old absurdity that you are, am I to write to you again? Is not\r\nmy life full enough of business, of flannel petticoats, aprons, and the\r\nwiping of dirty little noses? Must I sew and trot babies and sing songs,\r\nand tell Mother Goose stories, and still be expected to know how to\r\nwrite? My fingers are becoming less and less familiar with the pen, my\r\nthoughts grow daily more insignificant and commonplace. What earthly\r\ngood can my letters do to anyone? What interesting information can I\r\nimpart to anyone? Not that I am not happy, very happy, but then I have\r\nquite lost the power of contributing to the amusement of others....\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _To her sister Annie_\r\n\r\n                                                    1845 or 1846.\r\n\r\n... I visited my Mother Otis[28] on Thursday evening, and had a pleasant\r\ntime. I went alone, Chev being philanthropically engaged--party being\r\nover, I called for him at Mr. Mann's, but they were so happy over their\r\nreport that they concluded to make a night of it, and I came home alone.\r\nChev returned at one, quite intoxicated with benevolence....\r\n\r\n  [28] Mrs. Harrison Gray Otis.\r\n\r\nFinding that the isolation of South Boston was telling seriously upon\r\nher health and spirits, the Doctor decided on a change, and the winter\r\nof 1846 was spent at the Winthrop House in Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                            Monday morning, 1846.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST, SWEETEST ANNIE,--\r\n\r\n... I have neglected you sadly this winter, and my heart reproaches me\r\nfor it.... It has been strange to me, to return to life and to feel that\r\nI have any sympathy with living beings.... I have been singing and\r\nwriting poetry, so you may know that I have been happy. Alas! am I not a\r\nselfish creature to prize these enjoyments as I do, above _almost_\r\neverything else in the world? God forgive me if I do wrong in following\r\nwith ardor the strongest instincts of my nature, but I have been doing\r\nwrong all my life, in some way or other. I have been giving a succession\r\nof little musical parties on Saturday evenings, and I assure you they\r\nhave been quite successful. I have to be sure only my little parlour in\r\nthe Winthrop House, but even that is larger than the grand saloon at S.\r\nNiccolo da Tolentino which managed to hold so much fun on Friday\r\nevenings. I have found some musical friends to sing with me--Lizzie\r\nCary, Mrs. Felton, Mr. Pelosos and William Story, of whom more anon....\r\nAgassiz, the learned and charming Frenchman, is also one of my\r\n_habitués_ on Saturday evenings, and Count Pourtalés, a Swiss nobleman\r\nof good family, who has accompanied Agassiz to this country! I\r\nilluminate my room with a chandelier and some candles, draw out the\r\npiano into the room, and order some ice from Mrs. Mayer's--so that the\r\nreception gives me very little trouble. My friends come at half-past\r\neight and stay until eleven. I do not usually have more than twenty\r\npeople, but once I have had nearly sixty, and those of the best people\r\nin Boston. Chev is very desirous of having a house in town, and is far\r\nmore pleased with my success than I am. My next party will be on the\r\ncoming Saturday. It is for Lizzie Rice and Sam Guild who are just\r\nmarried. Am I not an enterprising little woman?... Dear Annie, I am\r\nanxious to be with you, that I may really know how you are, and talk\r\nover all the little matters with you.... I always feel that this\r\nsuffering must be some expiation for all the follies of one's life,\r\nwhereupon I will improvise a couplet upon the subject.\r\n\r\n  Woman, being of all critters the darn'dest,\r\n  Is made to suffer the consarn'dest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\n                                                    May 17, 1847.\r\n\r\nMY SWEETEST BEAUTIFULLEST WEVIE,--\r\n\r\n... I have not written because I have been in a studious, meditative,\r\nand most uncommunicative frame of mind, and have very few words to throw\r\nat many dogs. It is quite delightful to take to study again, and to feel\r\nthat old and stupid as one may be, there is still in one's mind a little\r\npower of improvement.... The longer I live the more do I feel my utter\r\nchildlike helplessness about all practical affairs. Certainly a creature\r\nwith such useless hands was never before seen. I seem to need a dry\r\nnurse quite as much as my children. What useful thing can I possibly\r\nteach these poor little monkeys? For everything that is not soul I am an\r\nass, that I am. I have now been at Green Peace some six weeks, and it is\r\nvery pleasant and quiet, but oh! the season is so backward; it is the\r\n17th of May, and the trees are only beginning to blossom. Every day\r\ncomes a cold east wind to nip off my nose, and the devil a bit of\r\nanything else comes to Green Peace. I am thin and languid. I have never\r\nentirely recovered from my fever,[29] but my mind is clearer than it has\r\never been since my marriage. I am able to think, to study and to pray,\r\nthings which I cannot accomplish when my brain is oppressed....\r\n\r\n  [29] She had had a severe attack of scarlet fever during the winter.\r\n\r\nBoston has been greatly enlivened during the past month by a really fine\r\nopera, the troupe from Havana, much better than the N. Y. troupe, with a\r\nfine orchestra and chorus, all Italians. The Prima Donna is an artist of\r\nthe first order, and has an exquisite voice. I have had season tickets,\r\nand have been nearly every night. This is a great indulgence, as it is\r\nvery expensive, and I have one of the best boxes in the house, but Chev\r\nis the most indulgent of husbands. I never knew anything like it. Think\r\nof all he allows me, a house and garden, a delicious carriage and pair\r\nof horses, etc., etc., etc. My children are coming on famously. Julia,\r\nor as she calls herself, Romana, is really a fine creature, full of\r\nsensibility and of talent. She learns very readily, and reasons about\r\nthings with great gravity. She remembers every tune that she hears, and\r\ncan sing a great many songs. She is very full of fun, and so is my sweet\r\nFlossy, my little flaxen-haired wax doll. I play for them on the piano,\r\nLizzie beats the tambourine, and the two babies take hold of hands and\r\ndance. \"Is not your heart fully satisfied with such a sight?\" you will\r\nask me. I reply, dear Wevie, that the soul whose desires are not fixed\r\nupon the unattainable is dead even while it liveth, and that I am glad,\r\nin the midst of all my comforts, to feel myself still a pilgrim in\r\npursuit of something that is neither house nor lands, nor children, nor\r\nhealth. What that something is I scarce know. Sometimes it seems to me\r\none thing and sometimes another. Oh, immortality, thou art to us but a\r\npainful rapture, an ecstatic burthen in this earthly life. God teach me\r\nto bear thee until thou shalt bear me! The arms of the cross will one\r\nday turn into angels' wings, and lift us up to heaven. Don't think from\r\nthis rhapsody that I am undergoing a fit of pietistic exaltation. I am\r\nnot, but as I grow older, many things become clearer to me, and I feel\r\nat once the difficulty and the necessity of holding fast to one's soul\r\nand to its divine relationships, lest the world should cheat us of it\r\nutterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _To her sister Annie_\r\n\r\n                                     June 19 [1847], GREEN PEACE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LITTLE ANNIE,--\r\n\r\n... Boston has been in great excitement at the public debates of the\r\nPrison Discipline Society, which have been intensely interesting. Chev\r\nand Sumner have each spoken twice, in behalf of the Philadelphia system,\r\nand against the course of the Society. They have been furiously attacked\r\nby the opposite party. Chev's second speech drew tears from many eyes,\r\nand was very beautiful. Both of Sumner's have been fine, but the last,\r\ndelivered last evening, was _masterly_. I never listened to anything\r\nwith more intense interest,--he held the audience breathless for two\r\nhours and a half. I have attended all the debates save one--there have\r\nbeen seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\n                                                    July 1, 1847.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST OLD WEVIE,--\r\n\r\nI should have written you yesterday but that I was obliged to entertain\r\nthe whole Club[30] at dinner, prior to Hillard's departure. I gave them\r\na neat little dinner, soup, salmon, sweetbreads, roast lamb and pigeon,\r\nwith green peas, potatoes _au maitre d'hotel_, spinach and salad. Then\r\ncame a delicious pudding and blanc-mange, then strawberries, pineapple,\r\nand ice-cream, then coffee, etc. We had a pleasant time upon the whole.\r\nThat is, they had; for myself it is easy to find companions more\r\ncongenial than the Club. Still, I like them very well. I had last week a\r\nlittle meeting of the _mutual correction_ club, which was far pleasanter\r\nto me. This society is organized as follows: Julia Howe, grand universal\r\nphilosopher; Jane Belknap, charitable censor; Mary Ward, moderator;\r\nSarah Hale, optimist. I had them all to dinner and we were jolly, I do\r\nassure you. My children looked so lovely yesterday, in muslin dresses of\r\nbright pink plaid, made very full and reaching only to the knee, with\r\npink ribbands in their sleeves....\r\n\r\n  [30] The Five of Clubs. See _ante_.\r\n\r\nHow I do wish for you this summer. My little place is so green, my\r\nflowers so sweet, my strawberries so delicious--the garden produces six\r\nquarts or more a day. The cow gives delicious cream. I even make a sort\r\nof cream cheese which is not by any means to be despised. Do you eat\r\n_ricotta_ nowadays? Chev gave me a little French dessert set yesterday,\r\nwhich made my table look so pretty. White with very rich blue and gold.\r\nOh, but it was bunkum! Dear old Wevie, you must give me one summer, and\r\nthen I will give you a winter--isn't that fair? Chev promises to take me\r\nabroad in five years, if we should sell Green Peace well. They talk of\r\nmoving the Institution, in which case I should have to leave my pretty\r\nGreen Peace in two years more, but I should be sad to leave it, for it\r\nis very lovely. I don't know any news at all to communicate. The\r\nPresident[31] has just made a visit here; he was coolly but civilly\r\nreceived. His whole course has been very unpopular in Massachusetts, and\r\nnobody wanted to see the man who had brought this cursed Mexican War\r\nupon us. He was received by the Mayor with a brief but polite address,\r\nlodgings were provided for him, and a dinner given him by the city. But\r\nthere was no crowd to welcome him, no shouts, no waving of\r\nhandkerchiefs. The people quietly looked at him and said, \"This is our\r\nchief magistrate, is it? Well, he is _très peu de chose_.\" I of course\r\ndid not trouble myself to go and see him.... I send you an extract from a\r\ndaily paper. Can you tell me who is the authoress? It has been much\r\nadmired. Uncle John was very much tickled to see _somebody_ in print.\r\nTry it again, Blue Jacket.\r\n\r\n  [31] James K. Polk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wayward moods shown in these letters sometimes found other\r\nexpression. In those days her wit was wayward too: its arrows were\r\nalways winged, and sometimes over-sharp. In later life, when Boston and\r\neverything connected with it was unspeakably dear to her, she would not\r\nrecall the day when, passing on Charles Street the Charitable Eye and\r\nEar Infirmary, she read the name aloud and exclaimed, \"Oh! I did not\r\nknow there was a charitable eye or ear in Boston!\" Or that other day,\r\nwhen having dined with the Ticknors, a family of monumental dignity, she\r\nsaid to a friend afterward, \"Oh! I am so cold! I have been dining with\r\nthe _Tête Noir_, the _Mer(e) de Glace_, and the _Jungfrau_!\"\r\n\r\nIt may have been in these days that an incident occurred which she thus\r\ndescribes in \"A Plea for Humour\": \"I once wrote to an intimate friend a\r\nvery high-flown and ridiculous letter of reproof for her frivolity. I\r\npresently heard of her as ill in bed, in consequence of my unkindness. I\r\nimmediately wrote, 'Did not you see that the whole thing was intended to\r\nbe a burlesque?' After a while she wrote back, 'I am just beginning to\r\nsee the fun of it, but the next time you intend to make a joke, pray\r\ngive me a fortnight's notice.' It was now my turn to take to my bed.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1847, a heavy sorrow came to her in the death of her\r\nbrother Marion, \"a gallant, gracious boy, a true, upright and useful\r\nman.\" She writes to her sister Louisa: \"Let us thank Him that Marion's\r\nlife gave us as much joy as his death has given us pain.... Our children\r\nwill grow up in love and beauty, and one of us will have a sweet boy who\r\nshall bear the dear name of Marion and make it doubly dear to us.\"\r\n\r\nThis prophecy was fulfilled first by the birth, on March 2, 1848, of\r\nHenry Marion Howe (named for the two lost brothers), and again in 1854\r\nby that of Francis Marion Crawford.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1847-48 was also spent in Boston, at No. 74 Mount Vernon\r\nStreet; here the first son was born. The Doctor, recording his birth in\r\nthe Family Bible, wrote after the name, \"_Dieu donné!_\" And, his mind\r\nfull of the Revolution of 1848 in France, added, \"_Liberté, Egalité,\r\nFraternité!_\"\r\n\r\nOn April 18 she writes: \"My boy will be seven weeks old to-morrow, and\r\n... such a darling little child was never seen in this world before....\r\nI shall have some fears lest his temperament partake of the melancholy\r\nwhich oppressed me during the period of his _creation_, but so far he is\r\nso placid and gentle, that we call him the little saint.... I have seen\r\nlittle of the world since his birth, and thought still less. I shall try\r\nto pursue my studies as I have through this last year, for I am good for\r\nnothing without them. I will rather give up the world and cut out Beacon\r\nStreet, but an hour or two for the cultivation of my poor little soul I\r\nmust and will have....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _To her sister Annie_\r\n\r\n                                                          [1848.]\r\n\r\nDEAREST ANNIE,--\r\n\r\n... My literary reputation is growing apace. Mr. Buchanan Read has\r\nwritten to me from Philadelphia to beg some poetry for a book he is\r\nabout to publish, and I am going to hunt up some trash for him in the\r\ncourse of the week. I find that my name has been advertised in relation\r\nto Griswold's book[32]--people come to ask Chev if _that_ Mrs. Howe is\r\nhis wife. I feel as if I should make a horribly shabby appearance. Do\r\ntell me if Griswold liked the poems....\r\n\r\n  [32] _Female Poets of America._\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                       Sunday, December 15, 1849.\r\n\r\n... I do want to see you, best Annie, and to have a few long talks with\r\nyou about theology, the soul, the heart, life, matrimony, and the points\r\nof resemblance between the patriarch Noah and Sir Tipsy Squinteye. Those\r\ntalks, madam, are not to be had, so instead of the rich _crême fouettée_\r\nof our conversation, we will take an insipid water-ice of a letter\r\ntogether, the two spoons being ourselves, the sugar, ice and lemon\r\nrepresenting our three husbands, all mixed up together, the whole to be\r\nconsidered good when one can't get anything better. I will be hanged,\r\nhowever, if you shall make me say which is which.\r\n\r\nI pass my life after a singular manner, Annie. I am in the old room, in\r\nthe old house, even in the old dressing-gown, which is of some value,\r\ninasmuch as it furnishes my _rent_. I am in the old place, but the old\r\nDudie is not in me; in her stead is a spirit of crossness and dullness,\r\ninsensible to all the gentler influences of life, knowing no music,\r\npoetry, wit, or devotion, intent mainly upon holding on to the ropes,\r\nand upon getting through the present without too much consciousness of\r\nit.... All society has been paralyzed by the shocking murder of Dr.\r\nParkman. There has perhaps never been in Boston so horrible and\r\natrocious an affair. The details of the crime are too heart-sickening to\r\nbe dwelt upon. There can scarcely be a doubt of the guilt of Dr.\r\nWebster--the jury of inquest have returned a verdict of guilty, but he\r\nhas still a chance for his life, as his trial in court does not come on\r\nfor some months. The wisest people say that he will be convicted and\r\nhanged. I saw Dr. Parkman two or three days before he was missing--he\r\nwas an old friend of Chev's.... I have not been able to see much\r\ncompany, yet we have had a few pleasant people at the house, now and\r\nthen. Among these, a Mr. Twisleton, brother of Lord Saye and Sele, the\r\nmost agreeable John Bull I have seen this many a day, or indeed ever....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1849-50 was also spent at No. 74 Mount Vernon Street.\r\nHere, in February, 1850, a third daughter was born, and named Laura for\r\nLaura Bridgman. In the spring, our parents made a second voyage to\r\nEurope, taking with them the two youngest children, Julia Romana and\r\nFlorence being left in the household of Dr. Edward Jarvis.\r\n\r\nThey spent some weeks in England, renewing the friendships made seven\r\nyears before; thence they journeyed to Paris, and from there to Boppart,\r\nwhere the Doctor took the water cure. Julia seems to have been too busy\r\nfor letter-writing during this year; the Doctor writes to Charles Sumner\r\nof the beauty of Boppart, and adds: \"Julia and I have been enjoying\r\nwalks upon the banks of the Rhine, and rambles upon the hillside, and\r\nmusings among the ruins, and jaunts upon the waters as we have enjoyed\r\nnothing since we left home.\"\r\n\r\nHe had but six months' leave of absence; it was felt by both that Julia\r\nneeded a longer time of rest and refreshment; accordingly when he\r\nreturned she, with the two little children, joined her sisters, both\r\nnow married, and the three proceeded to Rome, where they spent the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crawford was living at Villa Negroni, where Mrs. Mailliard became\r\nher companion; Julia found a comfortable apartment in Via Capo le Case,\r\nwith the Edward Freemans on the floor above, and Mrs. David Dudley Field\r\non that below.\r\n\r\nThese were pleasant neighbors. Mrs. Freeman was Julia's companion in\r\nmany delightful walks and excursions; when Mrs. Field had a party, she\r\nborrowed Mrs. Howe's large lamp, and was ready to lend her tea-cups in\r\nreturn. There was a Christmas tree--the first ever seen in Rome!--at\r\nVilla Negroni; \"an occasional ball, a box at the opera, a drive on the\r\nCampagna.\"\r\n\r\nJulia found a learned Rabbi from the Ghetto, and resumed the study of\r\nHebrew, which she had begun the year before in South Boston. This\r\naccomplished man was obliged to wear the distinctive dress then imposed\r\nupon the Jews of Rome, and to be within the walls of the Ghetto by six\r\nin the evening. There were private theatricals, too, she appearing as\r\n\"Tilburina\" in \"The Critic.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the friends of this Roman winter none was so beloved as Horace\r\nBinney Wallace. He was a Philadelphian, a _rosso_. He held that \"the\r\nhighest effort of nature is to produce a _rosso_\"; he was always in\r\nsearch of the favored tint either in pictures or in living beings.\r\nTogether the two _rossi_ explored the ancient city, with mutual pleasure\r\nand profit.\r\n\r\nSome years later, on hearing of his death, she recalled these days of\r\ncompanionship in a poem called \"Via Felice,\"[33] which she sang to an\r\nair of her own composition. The poem appeared in \"Words for the Hour,\"\r\nand is one of the tenderest of her personal tributes:--\r\n\r\n  For Death's eternal city\r\n  Has yet some happy street;\r\n  'Tis in the Via Felice\r\n  My friend and I shall meet.\r\n\r\n  [33] Formerly part of the Via Sistina.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1851 she turned her face westward. The call of husband,\r\nchildren, home, was imperative; yet so deep was the spell which Rome had\r\nlaid upon her that the parting was fraught with \"pain, amounting almost\r\nto anguish.\" She was oppressed by the thought that she might never again\r\nsee all that had grown so dear. Looking back upon this time, she says,\r\n\"I have indeed seen Rome and its wonders more than once since that time,\r\nbut never as I saw them then.\"\r\n\r\nThe homeward voyage was made in a sailing-vessel, in company with Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Mailliard. They were a month at sea. In the long quiet mornings\r\nJulia read Swedenborg's \"Divine Love and Wisdom\"; in the afternoons\r\nEugène Sue's \"_Mystères de Paris_,\" borrowed from a steerage passenger.\r\nThere was whist in the evening; when her companions had gone to rest she\r\nwould sit alone, thinking over the six months, weaving into song their\r\npleasures and their pains. The actual record of this second Roman winter\r\nis found in \"Passion Flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\"PASSION FLOWERS\"\r\n\r\n1852-1858; _aet._ 33-39\r\n\r\nROUGE GAGNE\r\n\r\n  The wheel is turned, the cards are laid;\r\n  The circle's drawn, the bets are made:\r\n  I stake my gold upon the red.\r\n\r\n  The rubies of the bosom mine,\r\n  The river of life, so swift divine,\r\n  In red all radiantly shine.\r\n\r\n  Upon the cards, like gouts of blood,\r\n  Lie dinted hearts, and diamonds good,\r\n  The red for faith and hardihood.\r\n\r\n  In red the sacred blushes start\r\n  On errand from a virgin heart,\r\n  To win its glorious counterpart.\r\n\r\n  The rose that makes the summer fair,\r\n  The velvet robe that sovereigns wear,\r\n  The red revealment could not spare.\r\n\r\n  And men who conquer deadly odds\r\n  By fields of ice, and raging floods,\r\n  Take the red passion from the gods.\r\n\r\n  Now, Love is red, and Wisdom pale,\r\n  But human hearts are faint and frail\r\n  Till Love meets Love, and bids it hail.\r\n\r\n  I see the chasm, yawning dread;\r\n  I see the flaming arch o'erhead:\r\n  I stake my life upon the red.\r\n\r\n                                         J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that from her earliest childhood Julia Ward's need of\r\nexpressing herself in verse was imperative. Every emotion, deep or\r\ntrivial, must take metrical shape; she laughed, wept, prayed--even\r\nstormed, in verse.\r\n\r\nWalking with her one day, her sister Annie, always half angel, half\r\nsprite, pointed to an object in the road. \"Dudie dear,\" she said;\r\n\"squashed frog! little verse, dear?\"\r\n\r\nWe may laugh with the two sisters, but under the laughter lies a deep\r\nsense of the poet's nature.\r\n\r\nAs in her dreamy girlhood she prayed--\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! give me back my golden lyre!\"--\r\n\r\nso in later life she was to pray--\r\n\r\n  \"On the Matron's time-worn mantle\r\n  Let the Poet's wreath be laid.\"\r\n\r\nThe tide of song had been checked for a time; after the second visit to\r\nRome, it flowed more freely than ever. By the winter of 1853-54, a\r\nvolume was ready (the poems chosen and arranged with the help of James\r\nT. Fields), and was published by Ticknor and Fields under the title of\r\n\"Passion Flowers.\"\r\n\r\nNo name appeared on the title-page; she had thought to keep her\r\n_incognito_, but she was recognized at once as the author, and the book\r\nbecame the literary sensation of the hour. It passed rapidly through\r\nthree editions; was, she says, \"much praised, much blamed, and much\r\ncalled in question.\"\r\n\r\nShe writes to her sister Annie:--\r\n\r\n\"The history of all these days, beloved, is comprised in one phrase, the\r\nmiseries of proof-reading. Oh, the endless, endless plague of looking\r\nover these proof-sheets--the doubts about phrases, rhymes, and\r\nexpressions, the perplexity of names, especially, in which I have not\r\nbeen fortunate. To-morrow I get my last proof. Then a fortnight must be\r\nallowed for drying and binding. Then I shall be out, fairly out, do you\r\nhear? So far my secret has been pretty well kept. My book is to bear a\r\nsimple title without my name, according to Longfellow's advice.\r\nLongfellow has been reading a part of the volume in sheets. He says it\r\nwill make a sensation.... I feel much excited, quite unsettled,\r\nsometimes a little frantic. If I succeed, I feel that I shall be humbled\r\nby my happiness, devoutly thankful to God. Now, I will not write any\r\nmore about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe warmest praise came from the poets,--the \"high, impassioned few\" of\r\nher \"Salutatory.\" Whittier wrote:--\r\n\r\n                                       AMESBURY, 29th, 12 mo. 53.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FR'D,--\r\n\r\nA thousand thanks for thy volume! I rec'd it some days ago, but was too\r\nill to read it. I glanced at \"Rome,\" \"Newport and Rome,\" and they\r\nexcited me like a war-trumpet. To-day, with the wild storm drifting\r\nwithout, my sister and I have been busy with thy book, and basking in\r\nthe warm atmosphere of its flowers of passion. It is a great book--it\r\nhas placed thee at the head of us all. I like its noble aims, its scorn\r\nand hate of priestcraft and Slavery. It speaks out bravely, beautifully\r\nall I have _felt_, but could not express, when contemplating the\r\ncondition of Europe. God bless thee for it!\r\n\r\nI owe an apology to Dr. Howe, if not to thyself, for putting into\r\nverse[34] an incident of his early life which a friend related to me.\r\nWhen I saw his name connected with it, in some of the papers that copied\r\nit, I felt fearful that I had wounded, perhaps, the feelings of one I\r\nlove and honor beyond almost any other man, by the liberty I have taken.\r\nI can only say I could not well help it--a sort of necessity was before\r\nme, to say what I did.\r\n\r\n  [34] \"The Hero.\" See Whittier's _Poems_.\r\n\r\nI wish I _could_ tell thee how glad thy volume has made me. I have\r\nmarked it all over with notes of admiration. I dare say it has faults\r\nenough, but thee need not fear on that account. It has beauty enough to\r\nsave thy \"slender neck\" from the axe of the critical headsman. The\r\nveriest \"de'il\"--as Burns says--\"wad look into thy face and swear he\r\ncould na wrang thee.\"\r\n\r\nWith love to the Doctor and thy lovely little folk,\r\n\r\nI am\r\n                           Very sincerely thy friend,\r\n                                                JOHN G. WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmerson wrote:--\r\n\r\n                                   CONCORD, MASS., 30 Dec., 1853.\r\nDEAR MRS. HOWE,--\r\n\r\nI am just leaving home with much ado of happy preparation for an absence\r\nof five weeks, but must take a few moments to thank you for the\r\nhappiness your gift brings me. It was very kind in you to send it to me,\r\nwho have forfeited all apparent claims to such favor, by breaking all\r\nthe laws of good neighborhood in these years. But you were entirely\r\nright in sending it, because, I fancy, that among all your friends, few\r\nhad so earnest a desire to know your thoughts, and, I may say, so much\r\nregret at never seeing you, as I. And the book, as I read in it, meets\r\nthis curiosity of mine, by its poems of character and confidence,\r\nprivate lyrics, whose air and words [are] all your own. I have not gone\r\nso far in them as to have any criticism to offer you, and like better\r\nthe pure pleasure I find in a new book of poetry so warm with life.\r\nPerhaps, when I have finished the book, I shall ask the privilege of\r\nsaying something further. At present I content myself with thanking you.\r\n\r\n                                    With great regard,\r\n                                                   R. W. EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes, always generous in his welcome to younger\r\nwriters, sent the following poem, never before printed:--\r\n\r\n  If I were one, O Minstrel wild.\r\n    That held \"the golden cup\"\r\n  Not unto thee, Art's stolen child,\r\n    My hand should yield it up;\r\n\r\n  Why should I waste its gold on one\r\n    That holds a guerdon bright--\r\n  A chalice, flashing in the sun\r\n    Of perfect chrysolite.\r\n\r\n  And shaped on such a swelling sphere\r\n    As if some God had pressed\r\n  Its flowing crystal, soft and clear\r\n    On Hebe's virgin breast?\r\n\r\n  What though the bitter grapes of earth\r\n    Have mingled in its wine?\r\n  The stolen fruits of heavenly birth\r\n    Have made its hue divine.\r\n\r\n  Oh, Lady, there are charms that win\r\n    Their way to magic bowers,\r\n  And they that weave them enter in\r\n    In spite of mortal powers;\r\n\r\n  And hearts that seek the chapel's floor\r\n    Will throb the long aisle through,\r\n  Though none are waiting at the door\r\n    To sprinkle holy dew!\r\n\r\n  I, sitting in the portal gray\r\n    Of Art's cathedral dim,\r\n  Can see thee, passing in to pray\r\n    And sing thy first-born hymn;--\r\n\r\n  Hold out thy hand! these scanty drops\r\n    Come from a hallowed stream,\r\n  Its sands, a poet's crumbling hopes,\r\n    Its mists, his fading dream.\r\n\r\n  Pass on. Around the inmost shrine\r\n    A few faint tapers burn;\r\n  This altar, Priestess, shall be thine\r\n    To light and watch in turn;\r\n\r\n  Above it smiles the Mother Maid,\r\n    It leans on Love and Art,\r\n  And in its glowing depth is laid\r\n    The first true woman's heart!\r\n\r\n                                                         O. W. H.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Jan. 1, 1854.\r\n\r\nThis tribute from the beloved Autocrat touched her deeply, the more so\r\nthat in the \"Commonwealth\"[35] she had recently reviewed some of his\r\nown work rather severely. She made her acknowledgment in a poem entitled\r\n\"A Vision of Montgomery Place,\"[36] in which she pictures herself as a\r\nsheeted penitent knocking at Dr. Holmes's door.\r\n\r\n  [35] The _Commonwealth_ was a daily newspaper published in the\r\n  Anti-Slavery interest. Dr. Howe was one of its organizers, and for some\r\n  time its editor-in-chief. She says, \"Its immediate object was to reach\r\n  the body politic which distrusted rhetoric and oratory, but which sooner\r\n  or later gives heed to dispassionate argument and the advocacy of plain\r\n  issues.\" She helped the Doctor in his editorial work, and enjoyed it\r\n  greatly, writing literary and critical articles, while he furnished the\r\n  political part.\r\n\r\n  [36] Printed in _Words for the Hour_, 1857.\r\n\r\n  I was the saucy Commonwealth:\r\n  Oh! help me to repent.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Behind my embrasure well-braced,\r\n  With every chance to hit,\r\n  I made your banner, waving wide,\r\n  A mark for wayward wit.\r\n\r\n  'Twas now my turn to walk the street,\r\n  In dangerous singleness,\r\n  And run, as bravely as I might,\r\n  The gauntlet of the press.\r\n\r\n  And when I passed your balcony\r\n  Expecting only blows,\r\n  From height or vantage-ground, you stooped\r\n  To whelm me with a rose.\r\n\r\n  A rose, intense with crimson life\r\n  And hidden perfume sweet--\r\n  Call out your friends, and see me do\r\n  My penance in the street.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe writes her sister Annie:--\r\n\r\n\"My book came out, darling, on Friday last. You have it, I hope, ere\r\nthis time. The simple title, 'Passion Flowers,' was invented by\r\nScherb[37] and approved by Longfellow. Its success became certain at\r\nonce. Hundreds of copies have already been sold, and every one likes it.\r\nFields foretells a second edition--it is sure to pay for itself. It has\r\ndone more for me, in point of consideration here, than a fortune of a\r\nhundred thousand dollars. Parker quoted some of my verses in his\r\nChristmas sermon, and this I considered as the greatest of honors. I sat\r\nthere and heard them, glowing all over. The authorship is, of course, no\r\nsecret now....\"\r\n\r\n  [37] A German scholar, at this time an _habitué_ of the house.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the volume long after, she says, \"It was a timid performance\r\nupon a slender reed.\"\r\n\r\nThree years later a second volume of verse was published by Ticknor and\r\nFields under the title of \"Words for the Hour.\" Of this, George William\r\nCurtis wrote, \"It is a better book than its predecessor, but will\r\nprobably not meet with the same success.\"\r\n\r\nShe had written plays ever since she was nine years old. In 1857, the\r\nsame year which saw the publication of \"Words for the Hour,\" she\r\nproduced her first serious dramatic work, a five-act drama entitled \"The\r\nWorld's Own.\" It was performed in New York at Wallack's Theatre, and in\r\nBoston with Matilda Heron and the elder Sothern in the leading parts.\r\nShe notes that one critic pronounced the play \"full of literary merits\r\nand of dramatic defects\"; and she adds, \"It did not, as they say, 'keep\r\nthe stage.'\"\r\n\r\nYet her brother Sam writes to her from New York: \"Lenore still draws the\r\nbest houses; there was hardly standing room on Friday night\"; and again:\r\n\"Mr. Russell went last night, a second time, bought the libretto, which\r\nI send you by this mail--declares that there is not a grander play in\r\nour language. He says that it is full of dramatic vigor, that the\r\ninterest never flags--but that unhappily Miss H., with the soul and\r\nself-abandonment of a great actress, lacks those graces of elocution,\r\nwhich should set forth the beauties of your verses.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the critics blamed the author severely for her choice of a\r\nsubject--the betrayal and abandonment of an innocent girl by a villain;\r\nthey thought it unfeminine, not to say indelicate, for a woman to write\r\nof such matters.\r\n\r\nAt that time nothing could be farther from her thoughts than to be\r\nclassed with the advocates of Women's Rights as they then appeared; yet\r\nin \"The World's Own\" are passages which show that already her heart\r\ncherished the high ideal of her sex, for which her later voice was to be\r\nuplifted:--\r\n\r\n  I think we call them Women, who uphold\r\n  Faint hearts and strong, with angel countenance;\r\n  Who stand for all that's high in Faith's resolve,\r\n  Or great in Hope's first promise.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Ev'n the frail creature with a moment's bloom,\r\n  That pays your pleasure with her sacrifice,\r\n  And, having first a marketable price,\r\n  Grows thenceforth valueless,--ev'n such an one,\r\n  Lifted a little from the mire, and purged\r\n  By hands severely kind, will give to view\r\n  The germ of all we honor, in the form\r\n  Of all that we abhor. You fling a jewel\r\n  Where wild feet tramp, and crushing wheels go by;\r\n  You cannot tread the splendor from its dust;\r\n  So, in the shattered relics, shimmers yet\r\n  Through tears and grime, the pride of womanhood.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must not forget the Comic Muse. Comparatively little of her humorous\r\nverse is preserved; she seldom thought it important enough to make two\r\ncopies, and the first draft was often lost or given away. The following\r\nwas written in the fifties, when Wulf Fries was a young and much-admired\r\nmusician in Boston. Miss Mary Bigelow had invited her to her house \"at\r\nnine o'clock\" to hear him play, meaning nine in the morning. She took\r\nthis for nine in the evening; the rest explains itself:--\r\n\r\n  Miss Mary Big'low, you who seem\r\n      So debonair and kind,\r\n  Pray, what the devil do you mean\r\n      (If I may speak my mind)\r\n\r\n  By asking me to come and hear\r\n      That Wulf of yours a-Friesing,\r\n  Then leaving me to cool my heels\r\n      In manner so unpleasing?\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  With Mrs. Dr. Susan you\r\n      That eve, forsooth, were tea-ing:\r\n  Confess you knew that I should come,\r\n      And from my wrath were fleeing!\r\n\r\n  To Mrs. Dr. Susan's I\r\n      Had not invited been:\r\n  So when the maid said, \"Best go there!\"\r\n      I answered, \"Not so green!\"\r\n\r\n  Within the darksome carriage hid\r\n      I bottled up my beauty,\r\n  And, rather foolish, hurried home\r\n      To fireside and duty.\r\n\r\n  It's very pleasant, _you_ may think,\r\n      On winter nights to roam;\r\n  But when you next invite abroad,\r\n      _This_ wolf will freeze at home!\r\n\r\nWhile she was pouring out her heart in poem and play, and the Doctor was\r\nriding the errands of the hour and binding up the wounds of Humanity,\r\nwhat, it may be asked,--it _was_ asked by anxious friends,--was becoming\r\nof the little Howes? Why, the little Howes (there were now five, Maud\r\nhaving been born in November, 1854) were having perhaps the most\r\nwonderful childhood that ever children had. Spite of the occasional\r\nwinters spent in town, our memories centre round Green Peace;--there\r\nParadise blossomed for us. Climbing the cherry trees, picnicking on the\r\nterrace behind the house, playing in the bowling-alley, tumbling into\r\nthe fishpond,--we see ourselves here and there, always merry, always\r\nvigorous and robust. We were also studying, sometimes at school,\r\nsometimes with our mother, who gave us the earliest lessons in French\r\nand music; more often, in those years, under various masters and\r\ngovernesses. The former were apt to be political exiles, the Doctor\r\nalways having many such on hand, some learned, all impecunious, all\r\nseeking employment. We recall a Pole, a Dane, two Germans, one\r\nFrenchman. The last, poor man, was married to a Smyrniote woman with a\r\nbad temper; neither spoke the other's language, and when they quarrelled\r\nthey came to the Doctor, demanding his services as interpreter.\r\n\r\nThrough successive additions, the house had grown to a goodly size; the\r\nnew part, with large, high-studded rooms, towering above the ancient\r\nfarmhouse, which nevertheless seemed always the heart of the place.\r\nBetween the two was a conservatory, a posy of all sweet flowers: the\r\nlarge greenhouse was down in the garden, under the same roof as the\r\nbowling-alley.\r\n\r\nThe pears and peaches and strawberries of Green Peace were like no\r\nothers that ever ripened; we see ourselves tagging at our father's\r\nheels, watching his pruning and grafting with an absorption equalling\r\nhis own, learning from him that there must be honor in gardens as\r\nelsewhere, and that fruit taken from his hand was sweet, while stolen\r\nfruit would be bitter.\r\n\r\nWe see ourselves gathered in the great dining-room, where the grand\r\npiano was, and the Gobelin carpet with the strange beasts and fishes,\r\nbought at the sale of the ex-King Joseph Bonaparte's furniture at\r\nBordentown, and the Snyders' Boar Hunt, which one of us could never pass\r\nwithout a shiver; see ourselves dancing to our mother's\r\nplaying,--wonderful dances, invented by Flossy, who was always _première\r\ndanseuse_, and whose \"Lady Macbeth\" dagger dance was a thing to\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nThen perhaps the door would open, and in would come \"Papa\" as a bear, in\r\nhis fur overcoat, growling horribly, and chase the dancers into corners,\r\nthey shrieking terrified delight.\r\n\r\nAgain, we see ourselves clustered round the piano while our mother sang\r\nto us; songs of all nations, from the Polish drinking-songs that Uncle\r\nSam had learned in his student days in Germany, down to the Negro\r\nmelodies which were very near our hearts.\r\n\r\nBest of all, however, we loved her own songs: cradle-songs and nursery\r\nnonsense made for our very selves--\r\n\r\n  \"(Sleep, my little child.\r\n  So gentle, sweet and mild!\r\n  The little lamb has gone to rest,\r\n  The little bird is in its nest,--\"\r\n\r\n\"Put in the donkey!\" cries Laura. The golden voice goes on without a\r\npause--\r\n\r\n  \"The little donkey in the stable\r\n  Sleeps as sound as he is able;\r\n  All things now their rest pursue,\r\n  You are sleepy too!)\"\r\n\r\nAgain, she would sing passionate songs of love or battle, or hymns of\r\nlofty faith and aspiration. One and all, we listened eagerly; one and\r\nall, we too began to see visions and dream dreams.\r\n\r\nNow and then, the Muse and Humanity had to stand aside and wait while\r\nthe children had a party; such a party as no other children ever had.\r\nWhat wonder, when both parents turned the full current of their power\r\ninto this channel?\r\n\r\nOur mother writes of one such festival:--\r\n\r\n\"My guests arrived in omnibus loads at four o'clock. My notes to parents\r\nconcluded with the following P.S.: 'Return-omnibus provided, with\r\ninsurance against plum-cake and other accidents.' A donkey carriage\r\nafforded great amusement out of doors, together with swing,\r\nbowling-alley, and the Great Junk. While all this was going on, the\r\nH.'s, J. S., and I prepared a theatrical exhibition, of which I had made\r\na hasty outline. It was the story of 'Blue Beard.' We had curtains which\r\ndrew back and forth, and regular footlights. You can't think how good it\r\nwas! There were four scenes. My antique cabinet was the 'Blue Beard'\r\ncabinet; we yelled in delightful chorus when the door was opened, and\r\nthe children stretched their necks to the last degree to see the\r\nhorrible sight. The curtain closed upon a fainting-fit done by four\r\nwomen. In the third scene we were scrubbing the fatal key, when I cried\r\nout, 'Try the \"Mustang Liniment\"! It's the liniment for us, for you know\r\nwe _must hang_ if we don't succeed!' This, which was made on the spur of\r\nthe moment, overcame the whole audience with laughter, and I myself\r\nshook so that I had to go down into the tub in which we were scrubbing\r\nthe key. Well, to make a long story short, our play was very successful,\r\nand immediately afterward came supper. There were four long tables for\r\nthe children; twenty sat at each. Ice-cream, cake, blanc-mange, and\r\ndelicious sugar-plums, oranges, etc., were served up 'in style.' We had\r\nour supper a little later. Three omnibus loads went from my door; the\r\nlast--the grown people--at nine o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n\"I have written a play for our doll-theatre, and performed it yesterday\r\nafternoon with great success. It occupied nearly an hour. I had\r\nalternately to grunt and squeak the parts, while Chev played the\r\npuppets. The effect was really extremely good. The spectators were in a\r\ndark room, and the little theatre, lighted by a lamp from the top,\r\nlooked very pretty.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one of these parties of which the Doctor wrote to Charles Sumner:\r\n\"Altogether it was a good affair, a religious affair; I say religious,\r\nfor there is nothing which so calls forth my love and gratitude to God\r\nas the sight of the happiness for which He has given the capacity and\r\nfurnished the means; and this happiness is nowhere more striking than in\r\nthe frolics of the young.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the plays given at Green Peace were the \"Three Bears,\" the Doctor\r\nappearing as the Great Big Huge Bear; and the \"Rose and the Ring,\" in\r\nwhich he played Kutasoff Hedzoff and our mother Countess Gruffanuff,\r\nwhile John A. Andrew, not yet Governor, made an unforgettable Prince\r\nBulbo.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of course to us children, that \"Papa and Mamma\" should\r\nplay with us, sing to us, tell us stories, bathe our bumps, and\r\naccompany us to the dentist; these were things that papas and mammas\r\ndid! Looking back now, with some realization of all the other things\r\nthey did, we wonder how they managed it. For one thing, both were rapid\r\nworkers; for another, both had the power of leading and inspiring others\r\nto work; for a third, so far as we can see, neither ever wasted a\r\nmoment; for a fourth, neither ever reached the point where there was not\r\nsome other task ahead, to be begun as soon as might be.\r\n\r\nLife with a Comet-Apostle was not always easy. Some one once expressed\r\nto \"Auntie Francis\" wonder at the patience with which she endured all\r\nthe troublesome traits of her much-loved husband. \"My dear,\" she\r\nreplied, \"I shipped as Captain's mate, for the voyage!\"\r\n\r\nOur mother, quoting this, says, \"I cannot imagine a more useful motto\r\nfor married life.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty-four years of her own married life the Doctor was\r\ncaptain, beyond dispute; yet sometimes the mate felt that she must take\r\nher own way, and took it quietly. She was fond of quoting the words of\r\nThomas Garrett,[38] whose house was for years a station of the\r\nUnderground Railway, and who helped many slaves to freedom.\r\n\r\n  [38] Of Wilmington, Delaware.\r\n\r\n\"How did you manage it?\" she asked him.\r\n\r\nHis reply sank deep into her mind.\r\n\r\n\"It was borne in upon me at an early period, that if I told no one what\r\nI intended to do, I should be enabled to do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe bond between our mother and father was not to be entirely broken\r\neven by death. She survived him by thirty-four years; but she never\r\ndiscussed with any one of us a question of deep import, or national\r\nconsideration, without saying, \"Your father would think thus, say thus!\"\r\nIt has been told elsewhere[39] how she once, being in Newport and waked\r\nfrom sleep by some noise, called to him; and how he, in Boston, heard\r\nher, and asked, when next they met, \"Why did you call me?\" To the end of\r\nher life, if startled or alarmed, she never failed to cry aloud, \"Chev!\"\r\n\r\n  [39] _Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe._\r\n\r\nChildren were not the only guests at Green Peace. Some of us remember\r\nKossuth's visit; our mother often told of the day when John Brown\r\nknocked at the door, and she opened it herself. To all of us, Charles\r\nSumner and his brothers, Albert and George, Hillard, Agassiz, Andrew,\r\nParker were familiar figures, and fit naturally into the background of\r\nGreen Peace.\r\n\r\nOf these Charles Sumner, always the Doctor's closest and best-beloved\r\nfriend, is most familiarly remembered. We called him \"the harmless\r\ngiant\"; and one of us was in the habit of using his stately figure as a\r\nrule of measurement. Knowing that he was just six feet tall, she would\r\nsay that a thing was so much higher or lower than Mr. Sumner. His deep\r\nmusical voice, his rare but kindly smile, are not to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nWe do not remember Nathaniel Hawthorne's coming to the house, but his\r\nshy disposition is illustrated by the record of a visit made by our\r\nparents to his house at Concord. While they were in the parlor, talking\r\nwith Mrs. Hawthorne, they saw a tall, slim man come down the stairs, and\r\nMrs. Hawthorne called out, \"Husband! Husband! Dr. Howe and Mrs. Howe are\r\nhere!\" Hawthorne bolted across the hall and out through the door without\r\neven looking into the parlor.\r\n\r\nOf Whittier our mother says:--\r\n\r\n\"I shall always be glad that I saw the poet Whittier in his youth and\r\nmine. I was staying in Boston during the winter of 1847, a young mother\r\nwith two dear girl babies, when Sumner, I think, brought Whittier to our\r\nrooms and introduced him to me. His appearance then was most striking.\r\nHis eyes glowed like black diamonds--his hair was of the same hue,\r\nbrushed back from his forehead. Several were present on this occasion\r\nwho knew him familiarly, and one of these persons bantered him a little\r\non his bachelor state. Mr. Whittier said in reply: 'The world's people\r\nhave taken so many of our Quaker girls that there is none left for me.'\r\nA year or two later, my husband invited him to dine, but was detained so\r\nlate that I had a tête-à-tête of half an hour with Mr. Whittier. We sat\r\nnear the fire, rather shy and silent, both of us. Whenever I spoke to\r\nWhittier, he hitched his chair nearer to the fire. At last Dr. Howe came\r\nin. I said to him afterwards, 'My dear, if you had been a little later,\r\nMr. Whittier would have gone up the chimney.'\"\r\n\r\nThe most welcome visitor of all was Uncle Sam Ward. He came into the\r\nhouse like light: we warmed our hands at his fire and were glad. It was\r\nnot because he brought us peaches and gold bracelets, Virginia hams (to\r\nbe boiled after his own recipe, with a bottle of champagne, a wisp of\r\nnew-mown hay and--we forget what else!), and fine editions of Horace: it\r\nwas because he brought himself.\r\n\r\n\"I disagree with Sam Ward,\" said Charles Sumner, \"on almost every known\r\ntopic: but when I have talked with him five minutes I forget everything\r\nsave that he is the most delightful companion in the world!\"\r\n\r\nA volume might be filled with Uncle Sam's _mots_ and jests; but print\r\nwould do him cold justice, lacking the kindling of his eyes and smile,\r\nthe mellow music of his laugh. Memory pictures rise up, showing him and\r\nour mother together in every variety of scene. We see them coming out of\r\nchurch together after a long and dull sermon, and hear him whisper to\r\nher, \"_Ce pauvre Dieu!_\"\r\n\r\nAgain, we see them driving together after some function at which the\r\naddress of one Potts had roused Uncle Sam to anger; hear him pouring\r\nout a torrent of eloquent vituperation, forgetting all else in the joy\r\nof freeing his mind. Pausing to draw breath, he glanced round, and,\r\nseeing an unfamiliar landscape, exclaimed, \"Where are we?\" \"At Potsdam,\r\nI think!\" said our mother quietly.\r\n\r\nHardly less dear to us than Green Peace, and far dearer to her, was the\r\nsummer home at Lawton's Valley, in Portsmouth,[40] Rhode Island. Here,\r\nas at South Boston, the Doctor's genius for \"construction and repairs\"\r\nwrought a lovely miracle. He found a tiny farmhouse, sheltered from the\r\nseawinds by a rugged hillock; near at hand, a rocky gorge, through which\r\ntumbled a wild little stream, checked here and there by a rude dam; in\r\none place turning the wheel of a mill, where the neighboring farmers\r\nbrought corn to grind. His quick eye caught the possibilities of the\r\nsituation. He bought the place and proceeded to make of it a second\r\nearthly paradise. The house was enlarged, trees were felled here,\r\nplanted there; a garden appeared as if by magic; in the Valley itself\r\nthe turbulent stream was curbed by stone embankments; the open space\r\nbecame an emerald lawn, set at intervals with Norway spruces; under the\r\ngreat ash tree that towered in the centre rustic seats and tables were\r\nplaced. Here, through many years, the \"Mistress of the Valley\" was to\r\npass her happiest hours; to the Valley and its healing balm of quiet she\r\nowed the inspiration of much of her best work.\r\n\r\n  [40] Near Newport, of which it is really a suburb.\r\n\r\nThe following letters fill in the picture of a time to which in her\r\nlater years she looked back as one of the happiest of her life.\r\n\r\nYet she was often unhappy, sometimes suffering. Humanity, her husband's\r\nfaithful taskmistress, had not yet set her to work, and the long hours\r\nof his service left her lonely, and--the babies once in bed--at a loss.\r\n\r\nHer eyes, injured in Rome, in 1843, by the throwing of _confetti_ (made,\r\nin those days, of lime), gave her much trouble, often exquisite pain.\r\nShe rarely, in our memory, used them in the evening. Yet, in later life,\r\nall the miseries, little and big, were dismissed with a smile and a sigh\r\nand a shake of the head. \"I was very naughty in those days!\" she would\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\n                                      GREEN PEACE, Feb. 18, 1853.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LOUISA,--\r\n\r\nI have kept a long silence with you, but I suppose that it is too\r\nevident before this time that letter-writing is not my _forte_, to need\r\nany further explanation of such a fact. Let me say, however, once for\r\nall, that I do not stand upon my reputation as a letter-writer. About my\r\npoetry and my music, I may be touchy and exacting--about my talents for\r\ndrawing, correspondence, and housekeeping, I can only say that my\r\npretensions are as small as my merits. With such humility, Justice\r\nherself must be satisfied. It is Modesty with her pink lining (commonly\r\nmistaken for blushes) turned outside. Are you surprised, my love, at the\r\nnew style of my writing, and do you think I must have been taking\r\nlessons of Mr. Bristow? Learn that my eyes do not allow me to look\r\nattentively at my writing, and that I give a glance and a scribble, in a\r\ntruly frantic and indiscriminate manner. Having ruined my own eyes, you\r\nsee, I am doing my utmost to ruin the eyes of my friends. This is human\r\nnature--all evil seeks thus to propagate itself, while good is satisfied\r\nwith itself, and stays where it is. When I think of this, I ask myself,\r\ndoes not the devil, then, send missionaries? You will agree with me that\r\nhe at least sends ambassadors. I have passed, so far, a very studious\r\nwinter. Never, since my youth, have I lived so much in reading and\r\nwriting--hence these eyes! Of course, you exclaim, what madness! but,\r\nindeed, I should have a worse madness if I did not cram myself with\r\nbooks. The bareness and emptiness of life were then insupportable....\r\n\r\nOf the nearly eighteen months since my return to America, I have passed\r\nfourteen at South Boston. Last winter I was fresh from my travels, and\r\nhad still strength enough to keep up my relation with society, and to\r\ninvite people a good deal to my house. But this year I am more worn\r\ndown, my health quite impaired, and the exertion of going out or\r\nreceiving at home is too much for me....\r\n\r\nI have made acquaintance with the Russell Lowells, but we are too far\r\napart to profit much by it. I cannot swim about in this frozen ocean of\r\nBoston life in search of friends. I feel as if I had struggled enough\r\nwith it, as if I could now fold my arms and go down....\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                        S. BOSTON, Dec. 20, 1853.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SISTER WEVIE,--\r\n\r\nI have been of late a shamefully bad correspondent, and am as much\r\nashamed of it as I ought to be. But, indeed, it hurts my eyes so\r\ndreadfully to write, and _that_ you may find it difficult to believe,\r\nfor perhaps you find writing less trying to the eyes than reading. Most\r\npeople do, but with me the contrary is the case. I can read with\r\ntolerable comfort, but cannot write a single page, without positive\r\npain. Well, that is enough about my eyes; now for other things. You say\r\nthat you tremble to know the result of the Lace purchase. Well you may,\r\nwretched woman. Don't be satisfied with trembling; shake! shiver! shrink\r\ninto nothing at all! Do you know, Madam, that my cursed bill from Hooker\r\namounted to over $130? The rascal charged me ten per cent, which you and\r\nhe probably divided together, or had a miscellaneous spree upon. You\r\nsent no specification of items. Madam, to this day, I do not know\r\nwhether the earrings or the lace cost the most. People ask me the price\r\nof bertha, flounces and earrings, I can only reply that Mrs. Crawford\r\ndrew upon me for an enormous sum of money, but that I have no idea how\r\nshe spent it. Moreover, my poor little means (a favorite expression of\r\nAnnie Mailliard's) have been entirely exhausted by you and Hooker. My\r\npurse is in a dangerous state of collapse--my credit all gone long ago.\r\nI want a coat, a bonnet, stockings, and pkthdkfs, but when for want of\r\nthese things I am cold and snuffly, I go and take out the flounces,\r\nlook at them, turn them over, and say: \"Well, they are _very_ warming\r\nfor the price, aren't they?\" Besides, you send me a bill, and don't send\r\nAunt Lou McAllister any. Who paid for her Malachites? I have a great\r\nmind to say that I did, and pocket the money, which she is anxious to\r\npay, if she could only get her account settled, which please to attend\r\nto at once, you lymphatic, agreeable monster! About the mosaics, straw\r\nfor Bonnets, and worsted work, you were right in supposing that I would\r\nnot be very angry. It was undoubtedly a liberty, your sending them, but\r\nit is one which I can make up my mind to overlook, especially as you\r\nwill not be likely to do it again for some time.\r\n\r\nNow, if you really want to know about the lace, I will tell you that I\r\nfound it perfectly magnificent, and that every one who sees it admires\r\nit prodigiously. If this is the case now, before I have worn it, how\r\nmuch more will it be so when it shall show itself abroad heightened by\r\nthe charms of my person! Admiration will then know no bounds. Newspaper\r\nparagraphs will begin thus: \"The lovely wearer of the lace is about\r\nthirty-four years of age, but looks much older--in fact, nearly as\r\nantique as her own flounces,\" etc., etc. The ornaments are not less\r\nbeautiful, in their kind. I wear them on distinguished occasions, and at\r\nsight of them, people who have closely adhered to the Decalogue all\r\ntheir lives incontinently violate the Tenth Commandment, and then excuse\r\nit by saying that Mrs. Howe does not happen to be their neighbor, living\r\nas she does beyond the reach of everything but Omnibuses and Charity.\r\nSo you see that I consider the investment a most successful one, and may\r\nin future honor you with more commissions. I even justify it to myself\r\non the ground that the Brooch and earrings will make charming pins for\r\nmy three girls, while the lace, Mrs. Cary says, is as good as Real\r\nEstate. So set your kind heart completely at rest, you _could_ not have\r\ndone better for me, or if you could, I don't know it. As to my being\r\nwithout pocket handkerchiefs, you will be the first to reply that _that_\r\nis nothing new. Now for your charming presents; I was greatly delighted\r\nat them. The Mosaics are perfectly exquisite, the most beautiful I ever\r\nsaw. The straw is very handsome, and will make me the envy of Newport,\r\nnext summer. The worsted work appears to me rich and quaint, and shall\r\nbe made up as soon as circumstances shall allow. For each and all accept\r\nmy hearty thanks....\r\n\r\n\r\n(_No year. Probably from Portsmouth, Rhode Island, to her sister Annie_)\r\n\r\n                                                Sunday, August 5.\r\n\r\n... I went in town [Newport] the other day, and dined with Fanny\r\nLongfellow. The L.'s, Curtis,[41] Tommo,[42] and Kensett are all living\r\ntogether, but seem to make out tolerably. After dinner Fanny took me to\r\ndrive on the Beach in her Barouche. I looked fine, wore my grey grapery\r\nwith my drapery, and spread myself out as much as possible. Curtis took\r\nJulia in his one-horse affair on the Beach. Julia wore a pink silk\r\ndress, a white drawn bonnet with pink ribbons, and a little white\r\nshawl. Oh, she did look lovely. Mamma was not at all proud, oh, no!\r\nWell, thereafter, I dined elsewhere and did not want to tell Dudie\r\nwhere. So when she asked, \"Where did you dine yesterday?\" I replied: \"I\r\ndined, dear, with Mrs. Jimfarlan, and her pig was at table. Now, before\r\nwe sat down, Mrs. J. said to me, 'Mrs. Howe, if you do not love my pig,\r\nyou cannot dine with me,' and I replied, 'Mrs. Jimfarlan, I adore your\r\npig,' so down we sat.\" \"Oh, yes, Mamma,\" says Julia, \"and I know the\r\nrest. When you had got through dinner, and had had all you wanted, you\r\nrose, and told the lady that you had something to tell her in the\r\ngreatest confidence. Then she went into the entry with you, and you\r\nwhispered in her ear, 'Mrs. Jimfarlan, I _hate_ your pig!' and then\r\nrushed out of the house.\"... I have had one grand tea-party--the Longos,\r\nCurtis, etc., etc. We had tea out of doors and read Tennyson in the\r\nvalley. It was very pleasant.... The children spent Tuesday with the\r\nHazards. I went over to tea. You remember the old beautiful place.[43]\r\nWe have now a donkey tandem, which is the joy of the Island. The\r\nchildren go out with it, and every one who meets them is seized with\r\ncramps in the region of the diaphragm, they double up and are relieved\r\nby a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n  [41] George William Curtis.\r\n\r\n  [42] Thomas Gold Appleton.\r\n\r\n  [43] Vaucluse, at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To her sister Annie_\r\n\r\n                                                   October, 1854.\r\n\r\nI will tell you how I have been living since my return from Newport. I\r\nget up at seven or a little before, and am always down at half-past for\r\nbreakfast. After breakfast I despatch the chicks to school and clear off\r\nthe table; then walk in the garden or around the house; then consult\r\nwith the cook and order dinner, and see as far as I can to all sewing\r\nand other work. I get to my own room between ten and eleven, where I\r\nstudy and write until two P.M. Dinner is at half-past two. After that I\r\ntake all the children in my room. I read to them and fix worsted work\r\nfor them. I get half an hour's reading for myself sometimes, but not\r\noften, the days being so short. Then I walk with dear Julia, the dearest\r\nlittle friend in the world. The others often join us, and sometimes we\r\nhave the donkey for a ride. I then go in and sing for the children, or\r\nplay for them to dance, until tea-time. At a quarter past eight I go to\r\nput Dudie and Flossy to bed. I prolong this last pleasure and occupation\r\nof the day. When I come down I sit with idle fingers, unable, as you\r\nknow, to do the least thing. Chev reads the papers to me. At ten I am\r\nthankful to retire. I do not suppose that this life is more monotonous\r\nthan yours in Bordentown, is it?...\r\n\r\n_Oct. 19th._ I was not able to finish this at one sitting, my best\r\ndarling. I cannot write long without great pain. I had to go in town on\r\nMonday and Tuesday, and yesterday, for a wonder, Baby [Laura] was ill.\r\nShe had severe rheumatic pains in both knees, and could not be moved all\r\nday. We sent for a physician, who prescribed various doses, and told us\r\nwe should have a siege of it. To-day she is almost well, though we gave\r\nher no medicine. She is the funniest little soul in the world. You\r\nshould hear her admonishing her father not to \"worry so about\r\neverything.\" He is obliged to laugh in spite of himself.... I am very\r\npoor just now. I furnished my Newport house with the money for my book\r\n[\"Passion Flowers\"]. It was very little--about $200.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpite of the troublesome eyes, and the various \"pribbles and prabbles,\"\r\nshe was in those days editor-in-chief of \"The Listener,\" a \"Weekly\r\nPublication.\" Julia Romana was sub-editor, and furnished most of the\r\nmaterial, stories, plays, and poems pouring with astonishing ease from\r\nher ten-year-old pen; but there was an Editor's Table, sometimes\r\ndictated by the chief editor, often written in her own hand.\r\n\r\nThe first number of \"The Listener\" appeared in October, 1854. The\r\nsub-editor avows frankly that \"The first number of our little paper will\r\nnot be very interesting, as we have not had time to give notice to those\r\nwho we expect to write for it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is followed by \"Select Poetry, Mrs. Howe\"; \"The Lost Suitor\" (to be\r\ncontinued), and \"Seaside Thoughts.\" The \"Editor's Table\" reads:--\r\n\r\n\"It is often said that Listeners hear no good of themselves, and it\r\noften proves to be true. But we shall hope to hear, at least, no harm of\r\nour modest little paper. We intend to listen only to good things, and\r\nnot to have ears for any unkind words about ourselves or others. Little\r\npeople of our age are expected to listen to those who are older, having\r\nso many things to learn. We will promise, too, to listen as much as we\r\ncan to all the entertaining news about town, and to give accounts of the\r\nnewest fashions, the parties in high life (nurseries are generally three\r\nstories _high_) and many other particulars. So, we venture to hope that\r\n'The Listener' will find favour with our friends and Miss Stephenson's\r\nselect public.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Miss Hannah Stephenson's school for girls, which Julia and\r\nFlorence were attending. \"The Listener\" gives pleasant glimpses of life\r\nat Green Peace, the Nursery Fair, the dancing-school, the new baby, and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\nSometimes the \"Table\" is a rhyming one:--\r\n\r\n  What shall we do for an Editor's table?\r\n  To make one really we are not able.\r\n  Our Editorial head is aching,\r\n  Our lily white hand is rather shaking.\r\n  Our baby cries both day and night,\r\n  And puts our \"intelligence\" all to flight.\r\n  Yet, for the gentle Julia's sake,\r\n  Some little effort we must make.\r\n  We didn't go vote for the know-nothing Mayor,\r\n  A know-nothing's what we cannot bear,\r\n  We know our lessons, that's well for us,\r\n  Or the school would be in a terrible fuss.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  That's all for the present, we make our best bow,\r\n  And are your affectionate\r\n\r\n                                            _Editor Howe_.\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1855, we read:--\r\n\r\n\"Last evening began the opera season. Now, as all the Somebodies were\r\nthere, we would not like to have you suppose, dear reader, that we were\r\nnot, although perhaps you did not see us, with our little squeezed-up\r\nhat slipping off of our head, and we screwing up our eyebrows to keep\r\nit on. There was a moment when we thought we felt it going down the back\r\nof our neck, but a dexterous twitch of the left ear restored the natural\r\norder of things. Well, to show you that we were there, we'll tell you of\r\nwhat the Opera was composed. There was love of course, and misery, and\r\nplenty of both. The slim man married the lady in white, and then ran\r\naway with another woman. She tore her hair, and went mad. One of the\r\nstout gentlemen doubled his fists, the other spread out his hands and\r\nlooked pitiful. The mad lady sang occasionally, and retained wonderful\r\ncommand of her voice. They all felt dreadfully, and went thro' a great\r\ndeal, singing all the time. The thing came right at last, but we have no\r\nroom to explain how.\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1855, the paper died a natural death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _To her sister Annie_\r\n\r\n                                     SOUTH BOSTON, Jan. 19, 1855.\r\n\r\nMY SWEET MEATEST,--\r\n\r\n... First of all you wish to know about the Bonnet, of course. I am\r\nhappy to say that it is entirely successful, cheap, handsome, and\r\nbecoming. Boston can show nothing like it. As to the green and lilac, I\r\nall but sleep in it. I never wear it, glory on my soul, without\r\nattracting notice. Those who don't know me, at lectures and sich, seem\r\nto say: \"Good heavens, who is that lovely creature?\" Those who do know\r\nme seem to be whispering to each other, \"I never saw Julia Howe look so\r\nwell!\" So much for the green bonnet. As for the white one, since I took\r\nout the pinch behind, it fits and flatters--to the Opera, I will\r\nincontinently wear it. I have been there and still would go. Every woman\r\nseen in front, seems to have a cap with a great frill, like that of an\r\nold-fashioned night-cap; it is only when she turns sideways that you can\r\nsee the little hat behind....\r\n\r\nDid I write you that I have been to the Assembly? Chev went to the first\r\nwithout me, with his niece, the pretty one, of course, much to my\r\nvexation, so I spunked up, and determined to go to the second. A white\r\nsilk dress was a necessary tho' unprofitable investment. Turnbull had,\r\nfortunately for me, made a failure, and was selling very cheap. I got a\r\npretty silk for $17, and had it made by a Boston fashionable dressmaker,\r\nwith three pinked flounces--it looked unkimmon. Next I caused my hair to\r\nbe dressed by Pauline, the wife of Canegally. \"Will you have it in the\r\nnewest fashion?\" asked she; \"the very newest,\" answered I. She put in\r\nfront two horrid hair cushions and, combing the hair over them, made a\r\nsort of turban of hair, in which I was, may I say? captivating. I was\r\nproud of my hair, and frequented rooms with looking-glasses in them, the\r\nrest of the afternoon. At the Ass-embly, Chev and I entered somewhat\r\ntimidly, but soon took courage, and parted company. Little B---- (your\r\nneighbor of Bond St.) was there, wiggy and smiley, but oh! so youthful!!\r\nLife is short, they say, but I don't think so when I see little B----\r\ntrying to look down upon me from beneath, and doing the patronizing.\r\nThere was something very nice about her, however, that is, her pearl\r\nnecklace with a diamond clasp two inches long, and one and a half\r\nbroad.... Oculist said weakness was the disease, and rest the\r\nremedy--oculist recommended veratrine ointment, frequent refreshing of\r\neyes with wet cloth, cleared his throat every minute, and was an old\r\nhumbug.\r\n\r\nThey are playing at the Boston Museum a piece, probably a farce, called\r\n\"A Blighted Being.\" When I see the handbills posted up in the streets it\r\nis like reading one's own name. I must now bid you farewell and am ever\r\nwith dearest love,\r\n\r\n                               Your affectionate sister and\r\n                                             A BLIGHTED BEING!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                      SOUTH BOSTON, June 1, 1855.\r\n\r\n... Well, my darling, it is a very uninteresting time with me. I am\r\nalive, and so are my five children. I made a vow, when dear Laura was so\r\nill, to complain never more of dulness or ennui. So I won't, but you\r\nunderstand if I hadn't made such a vow, I could under present\r\ncircumstances indulge in the howling in which my soul delighteth. I\r\ndon't know how I keep alive. The five children seem always waiting,\r\nmorally, to pick my bones, and are always quarrelling over their savage\r\nfeast.... The stairs as aforesaid kill me. The Baby keeps me awake, and\r\nkeeps me down in strength. Were it not for beer, I were little better\r\nthan a dead woman, but, blessed be the infusion of hops, I can still\r\nwink my left eye and look knowing with my right, which is more, God be\r\npraised, than could have been expected after eight months of\r\nInstitution. I have seen Opera of \"Trovatore\"--in bonnet trimmed with\r\ngrapes I went, bonnet baptized with \"oh d-Cologne,\" but Alexander\r\nMcDonald was my escort, Chev feeling very ill just at Opera time, but\r\nmaking himself strangely comfortable after my departure with easy-chair,\r\nfoot-stool, and unlimited pile of papers. Well, dear, you know they\r\nwould be better if they could, but somehow they can't--it isn't in\r\nthem....\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                     SOUTH BOSTON, Nov. 27, 1855.\r\n\r\nI have been having a wow-wow time of late, or you should have heard from\r\nme. As it is, I shall scribble a hasty sheet of Hieroglyphics, and put\r\nin it as much of myself as I can. Mme. Kossuth (Kossuth's sister\r\ndivorced from former husband) has been here for ten days past; as she is\r\nmuch worn and depressed I have had a good deal of comforting up to\r\ndo--very little time and much trouble. She is a _lady_, and has many\r\ninteresting qualities, but you can imagine how I long for the sanctity\r\nof home. Still, my heart aches that this woman, as well bred as any one\r\nof ourselves, should go back to live in two miserable rooms, with three\r\nof her four children, cooking, and washing everything with her own\r\nhands, and sitting up half the night to earn a pittance by sewing or\r\nfancy work. Her eldest son has been employed as engineer on the Saratoga\r\nand Sacketts Harbor railroad for two years, but has not been paid a\r\ncent--the R.R. being nearly or quite bankrupt. He is earning $5 a week\r\nin a Bank, and this is all they have to depend upon. She wants to hire\r\na small farm somewhere in New Jersey and live upon it with her\r\nchildren....\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To her sisters_\r\n\r\n                                              Thursday, 29, 1856.\r\n\r\n... We have been in the most painful state of excitement relative to\r\nKansas matters and dear Charles Sumner, whose condition gives great\r\nanxiety.[44] Chev is as you might expect under such circumstances; he\r\nhas had much to do with meetings here, etc., etc. New England spunk\r\nseems to be pretty well up, but what will be done is uncertain as yet.\r\nOne thing we have got: the Massachusetts Legislature has passed the\r\n\"personal liberty bill,\" which will effectually prevent the rendition of\r\nany more fugitive slaves from Massachusetts. Another thing, the Tract\r\nSociety here (orthodox) has put out old Dr. Adams, who published a book\r\nin favor of slavery; a third thing, the Connecticut legislature has\r\nwithdrawn its invitation to Mr. Everett to deliver his oration before\r\nthem, in consequence of his having declined to speak at the Sumner\r\nmeeting in Faneuil Hall....\r\n\r\n  [44] In consequence of the assault upon him in the Senate Chamber by\r\n  Preston Brooks of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _To her sister Annie_\r\n\r\n                                        CINCINNATI, May 26, 1857.\r\n\r\n                                               CASA GREENIS.\r\n\r\nDEAREST ANNIE, _Fiancée de marbre et Femme de glace_,--\r\n\r\nHeaven knows what I have not been through with since I saw you--dust,\r\ndirt, dyspepsia, hotels, railroads, prairies, Western steamboats,\r\nWestern people, more prairies, tobacco juice, captains of boats, pilots\r\nof ditto, long days of jolting in the cars, with stoppages of ten\r\nminutes for dinner, and the devil take the hindmost. There ought to be\r\nno chickens this year, so many eggs have we eaten. Flossy was quite ill\r\nfor two days at St. Louis. Chev is too rapid and restless a traveller\r\nfor pleasure. Still, I think I shall be glad to have made the journey\r\nwhen it is all over--I must be stronger than I was, for I bear fatigue\r\nvery well now and at first I could not bear it at all. We went from\r\nPhiladelphia to Baltimore, thence to Wheeling, thence to see the Manns\r\nat Antioch--they almost ate us up, so glad were they to see us. Thence\r\nto Cincinnati, where two days with Kitty Rölker, a party at Larz\r\nAnderson's--Longworth's wine-cellar, pleasant attentions from a\r\ngentleman by the name of King, who took me about in a carriage and\r\nproposed everything but marriage. After passing the morning with me, he\r\nasked if I was English. I told him no. When we met in the evening, he\r\nhad thought matters over, and exclaimed, \"You must be Miss Ward!\" \"And\r\nyou,\" I cried, \"must be the nephew of my father's old partner. Do you\r\nhappen to have a strawberry mark or anything of that kind about you?\"\r\n\"No.\" \"Then you are my long-lost Rufus!\" And so we rushed into each\r\nother's confidence and swore, like troopers, eternal friendship. Thence\r\nto Louisville, dear, a beastly place, where I saw the Negro jail, and\r\nthe criminal court in session, trying a man for the harmless pleasantry\r\nof murdering his wife. Thence to St. Louis, where Chev left us and went\r\nto Kansas, and Fwotty and I boated it back here and went to a hotel, and\r\nthe William Greenes they came and took us, and that's all for the\r\npresent....\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                         GARRET PLATFORM,\r\n                                  LAWTON'S VALLEY, July 13, 1857.\r\n\r\n... Charlotte Brontë is deeply interesting, but I think she and I would\r\nnot have liked each other, while still I see points of resemblance--many\r\nindeed--between us. Her life, on the whole, a very serious and\r\ninstructive page in literary history. God rest her! she was as faithful\r\nand earnest as she was clever--she suffered much.\r\n\r\n... Theodore Parker and wife came here last night, to stay a week if\r\nthey like it (have just had a fight with a bumble-bee, in avoiding which\r\nI banged my head considerably against a door, in the narrow limits of my\r\ngarret platform); so you see I am still a few squashes (\"some pumpkins\"\r\nis vulgar, and I isn't)....\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _To her sisters_\r\n\r\n                                        S. BOSTON, April 4, 1858.\r\n\r\n... I am perfectly worn out in mind, body and estate. The Fair[45]\r\nlasted five days and five evenings. I was there every day, and nearly\r\nall day, and at the end of it I dropped like a dead person. Never did I\r\nexperience such fatigue--the crowd of faces, the bad air, the\r\nresponsibility of selling and the difficulty of suiting everybody, was\r\nalmost too much for me. On the other hand, it was an entirely new\r\nexperience, and a very amusing one. My table was one of the prettiest,\r\nand, as I took care to have some young and pretty assistants, it proved\r\none of the most attractive. I cleared $426.00, which was doing pretty\r\nwell, as I had very little given me.... For a week after the Fair I\r\ncould do nothing but lie on a sofa or in an easy-chair, ... but by the\r\nend of the week I revived, and it pleased the Devil to suggest to me\r\nthat this was the moment to give a long promised party to the Governor\r\nand his wife. All hands set to work, therefore, writing notes. With the\r\nassistance of three Amanuenses I scoured the whole surface of Boston\r\nsociety.... Unluckily I had fixed upon an evening when there were to be\r\ntwo other parties, and of course the cream of the cream was already\r\nengaged. I believe in my soul that I invited 300 people--every day\r\neverybody sent word they could not come. I was full of anxiety, got the\r\nhouse well arranged though, engaged a colored man, and got a splendid\r\nsupper. Miss Hunt, who is writing for me, smacks her lips at the\r\nremembrance of the same, I mean the supper, not the black man. Well! the\r\nevening came, and with it all the odds and ends of half a dozen sets of\r\npeople, including some of the most primitive and some of the most\r\nfashionable. I had the greatest pleasure in introducing a dowdy high\r\nneck, got up for the occasion, with short sleeves and a bow behind, to\r\nthe most elaborate of French ball-dresses with head-dress to match, and\r\nleaving them to take care of each other the best way they could. As for\r\nthe Governor [Nathaniel P. Banks], I introduced him right and left to\r\npeople who had never voted for him and never will. The pious were\r\npermitted to enjoy Theodore Parker, and Julia's schoolmaster sat on a\r\nsofa and talked about Carlyle. I did not care--the colored man made it\r\nall right. Imagine my astonishment at hearing the party then and after\r\npronounced one of the most brilliant and successful ever given in\r\nBoston. The people all said, \"It is such a relief to see new faces--we\r\nalways meet the same people at city parties.\" Well, darlings, the\r\npickings of the supper was very good for near a week afterwards, and,\r\nhaving got through with my party, I have nearly killed myself with going\r\nto hear Mr. Booth, whose playing is beautiful exceedingly. Having for\r\nonce in my life had play enough and a great deal too much, I am going to\r\nwork to-morrow like an old Trojan building a new city. I am too poor to\r\ncome to New York this spring; still it is not impossible. Farewell,\r\nBeloveds, it is church time, and this edifying critter is uncommon\r\npunctual in her devotions. So farewell, love much, and so far as human\r\nweakness allows imitate the noble example of\r\n\r\n                                                  Your sister,\r\n                                                           JULIA.\r\n\r\n  [45] This Fair was got up by Mr. Robert C. Winthrop for the benefit\r\n  of the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLITTLE SAMMY: THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n1859-1863; _aet._ 40-44\r\n\r\n  There came indeed an hour of fate\r\n  By bitter war made desolate\r\n  When, reading portents in the sky,\r\n  All in a dream I leapt on high\r\n  To pin my rhyme to my country's gown.\r\n  'Tis my one verse that will not down.\r\n  Stars have grown out of mortal crown.\r\n\r\n                                               J. W. H.\r\n\r\n     I honour the author of the \"Battle Hymn,\" and of \"The Flag.\" She\r\n     was born in the city of New York. I could well wish she were a\r\n     native of Massachusetts. We have had no such poetess in New\r\n     England.\r\n\r\n                                            EMERSON'S _Journals_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1859 the Doctor's health became so much impaired by\r\noverwork that a change of air and scene was imperative. At the same time\r\nTheodore Parker, already stricken with a mortal disease, was ordered to\r\nCuba in the hope that a mild climate might check the progress of the\r\nconsumption. He begged the Howes to join him and his wife, and in\r\nFebruary the four sailed for Havana. This expedition is described in \"A\r\nTrip to Cuba.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening chapter presents three of the little party during the rough\r\nand stormy voyage:--\r\n\r\n\"The Philanthropist has lost the movement of the age,--keeled up in an\r\nupper berth, convulsively embracing a blanket, what conservative more\r\nimmovable than he? The Great Man of the party refrains from his large\r\ntheories, which, like the circles made by the stone thrown into the\r\nwater, begin somewhere and end nowhere. As we have said, he expounds\r\nhimself no more, the significant forefinger is down, the eye no longer\r\nimprisons yours. But if you ask him how he does, he shakes himself as\r\nif, like Farinata,--\r\n\r\n  '_avesse l'inferno in gran dispetto_,'--\r\n\r\nhe had a very contemptible opinion of hell.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral \"portraits\" follow, among them her own.\r\n\r\n\"A woman, said to be of a literary turn of mind, in the miserablest\r\ncondition imaginable. Her clothes, flung at her by the Stewardess, seem\r\nto have hit in some places and missed in others. Her listless hands\r\noccasionally make an attempt to keep her draperies together, and to pull\r\nher hat on her head; but though the intention is evident, she\r\naccomplishes little by her motion. She is being perpetually lugged about\r\nby a stout steward, who knocks her head against both sides of the\r\nvessel, folds her up in the gangway, spreads her out on the deck, and\r\ntakes her upstairs, downstairs, and in my lady's chamber, where, report\r\nsays, he feeds her with a spoon, and comforts her with such philosophy\r\nas he is master of. N.B. This woman, upon the first change of weather,\r\nrose like a cork, dressed like a Christian, and toddled about the deck\r\nin the easiest manner, sipping her grog, and cutting sly jokes upon her\r\nlate companions in misery;--is supposed by some to have been an\r\nimpostor, and, when ill-treated, announced intentions of writing a book.\r\n\r\n\"No. 4, my last, is only a sketch;--circumstances allowed no more. Can\r\nGrande,[46] the great dog, has been got up out of the pit, where he has\r\nworried the Stewardess and snapped at the friend who tried to pat him on\r\nthe head. Everybody asks where he is. Don't you see that heap of shawls\r\nyonder, lying in the sun, and heated up to about 212° Fahrenheit? That\r\nslouched hat on top marks the spot where his head should lie,--by\r\ntreading cautiously in the opposite direction you may discover his feet.\r\nAll between is perfectly passive and harmless. His chief food is\r\npickles,--his only desire is rest. After all these years of controversy,\r\nafter all these battles, bravely fought and nobly won, you might write\r\nwith truth upon this moveless mound of woollens the pathetic words from\r\nPère La Chaise: _Implora Pace_.\"\r\n\r\n  [46] Her pet name for Theodore Parker. _Vide_ Dante's _Inferno_.\r\n\r\nThe trip to Cuba was only the beginning of a long voyage for the\r\nParkers, who were bound for Italy. The parting between the friends was\r\nsad. All felt that they were to meet no more. Parker died in Florence\r\nfifteen months later.\r\n\r\n\"A pleasant row brought us to the side of the steamer. It was dusk\r\nalready as we ascended her steep gangway, and from that to darkness\r\nthere is, at this season, but the interval of a breath. Dusk too were\r\nour thoughts, at parting from Can Grande, the mighty, the vehement, the\r\ngreat fighter. How were we to miss his deep music, here and at home!\r\nWith his assistance we had made a very respectable band; now we were to\r\nbe only a wandering drum and fife,--the fife particularly shrill, and\r\nthe drum particularly solemn.... And now came silence, and tears, and\r\nlast embraces; we slipped down the gangway into our little craft, and\r\nlooking up, saw bending above us, between the slouched hat and the\r\nsilver beard, the eyes that we can never forget, that seemed to drop\r\nback in the darkness with the solemnity of a last farewell. We went\r\nhome, and the drum hung himself gloomily on his peg, and the little fife\r\n_shut up_ for the remainder of the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Trip to Cuba\" appeared first serially in the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" then\r\nin book form. Years after, a friend, visiting Cuba, took with her a copy\r\nof the little volume; it was seized at Havana by the customs house\r\nofficers, and confiscated as dangerous and incendiary material.\r\n\r\nOn her return, our mother was asked to write regularly for the New York\r\n\"Tribune,\" describing the season at Newport. This was the beginning of a\r\ncorrespondence which lasted well into the time of the Civil War. She\r\nsays of it:--\r\n\r\n\"My letters dealt somewhat with social doings in Newport and in Boston,\r\nbut more with the great events of the time. To me the experience was\r\nvaluable in that I found myself brought nearer in sympathy to the\r\ngeneral public, and helped to a better understanding of its needs and\r\ndemands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _To her sister Annie_\r\n\r\n                                        Sunday, November 6, 1859.\r\n\r\nThe potatoes arrived long since and were most jolly, as indeed they\r\ncontinue to be. Didn't acknowledge them 'cause knew other people did,\r\nand thought it best to be unlike the common herd. Have just been to\r\nchurch and heard Clarke preach about John Brown, whom God bless, and\r\nwill bless! I am much too dull to write anything good about him, but\r\nshall say something at the end of my book on Cuba, whereof I am at\r\npresent correcting the proof-sheets. I went to see his poor wife, who\r\npassed through here some days since. We shed tears together and embraced\r\nat parting, poor soul! Folks say that the last number of my Cuba is the\r\nbest thing I ever did, in prose or verse. Even Emerson wrote me about it\r\nfrom Concord. I tell you this in case you should not find out of your\r\nown accord that it is good. I have had rather an unsettled autumn--have\r\nbeen very infirm and inactive, but have kept up as well as\r\npossible--going to church, also to Opera, also to hear dear Edwin Booth,\r\nwho is playing better than ever. My children are all well and\r\ndelightful....\r\n\r\nI have finished Tacitus' history, also his Germans.... Chev is not at\r\nall annoyed by the newspapers, but has been greatly overdone by anxiety\r\nand labor for Brown. Much has come upon his shoulders, getting money,\r\npaying counsel, and so on. Of course all the stories about the Northern\r\nAbolitionists are the merest stuff. No one knew of Brown's intentions\r\nbut Brown himself and his handful of men. The attempt I must judge\r\ninsane but the spirit _heroic_. I should be glad to be as sure of heaven\r\nas that old man may be, following right in the spirit and footsteps of\r\nthe old martyrs, girding on his sword for the weak and oppressed. His\r\ndeath will be holy and glorious--the gallows cannot dishonor him--he\r\nwill hallow it....\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day, 1859, she gave birth to a second son, who was named\r\nSamuel Gridley. This latest and perhaps dearest child was for three\r\nshort years to fill his parents' life with a joy which came and went\r\nwith him. His little life was all beautiful, all bright. We associate\r\nhim specially with the years we spent at No. 13 Chestnut Street, Boston,\r\na spacious and cheerful house which we remember with real affection. The\r\nother children were at school; little Sam was the dear companion of our\r\nmother's walks, the delight of our father's few leisure hours. For him\r\nnew songs were made, new games invented: both parents looked forward to\r\nfresh youth and vigor in his sweet companionship. This was not to be.\r\n\"In short measures, life may perfect be\": little Sam died of\r\ndiphtheritic croup, May 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nThis heavy sorrow for a time crushed both these tender parents to the\r\nearth. Our father became seriously ill from grief; our mother, younger\r\nand more resilient, found some relief in nursing him and caring for the\r\nother children; but this was not enough. She could not banish from her\r\nmind the terrible memory of her little boy's suffering, the anguish of\r\nparting with him. While her soul lifted its eyes to the hills, her heart\r\nsought some way to keep his image constantly before her. Her sad\r\nthoughts must be recorded, and she took up, for the first time since\r\n1843, the habit of keeping a journal.\r\n\r\nThe first journal is a slender Diary and Memorandum Book. On May 13, the\r\nfirst note of alarm is sounded. Sammy \"did not seem quite right.\" From\r\nthat date the record goes on, the agonizing details briefly described,\r\nthe loss spoken of in words which no one could read unmoved. But even\r\nthis was not enough: grief must find further expression, yet must be\r\nrepressed, so far as might be, in the presence of others, lest her\r\nsorrow make theirs heavier. This need of expression took a singular\r\nform. She wrote a letter to the child himself, telling the story of his\r\nlife and death; wrote it with care and precision, omitting no smallest\r\ndetail, gathering, as it were a handful of pearls, every slightest\r\nmemory of the brief time.\r\n\r\nA few extracts show the tenor of this letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAREST LITTLE SAMMY,--\r\n\r\n\"It is four weeks to-day since I saw your sweet face for the last time\r\non earth. It did not look like your little face, my dear pet, it was so\r\nstill, and sad, and quiet. But Death had changed it, and I had to\r\nsubmit, and was thankful to have even so much of you as that still face,\r\nfor some days. Everybody grieved to part from you, dear little soul, but\r\nI suppose that I grieved most of all, because you belonged most to me.\r\nYou were always with me, from the time you began to exist at all. The\r\ntime of your birth was a sad one. It was the time of the imprisonment\r\nand death of John Brown, a very noble man, who should be in one of the\r\nmany mansions of which Christ tells us, and in which I hope, dear, that\r\nyou are nearer to Him than any of us can be....\r\n\r\n\"You arrived, I think, at three in the morning, very red in the face,\r\nand making a great time about it. You were a fine large Baby, weighing\r\ntwelve pounds.... I have some of your baby dresses left, and shall hunt\r\nthem up and lay them with the clothes you have worn lately.... I gave\r\nyou milk myself.... I used to lay you across my breast when you cried,\r\nand you liked this so well that you often insisted upon sleeping in that\r\nposition after you were grown quite large. It hurt me so much that I\r\nfinally managed to break you of the habit, but not until you were more\r\nthan a year old.... I had a nice crimson merino cloak made for you,\r\ntrimmed with velvet, and lined with white silk. I bought also a very\r\nnice crochet cap, of white and crimson worsted, and in these you were\r\ntaken to drive with me....\r\n\r\n\"During this first year of your life I had some troubles, and your Baby\r\nways were my greatest comfort. I used to think: this Baby will grow up\r\nto be a man, and will protect me when I am old. For I thought, dear,\r\nthat you should have outlived me many years. But you are removed from us\r\nto grow in another world, of which I know nothing but what Christ has\r\ntold me....\r\n\r\n\"You used to keep me awake a good deal at night, and this sometimes made\r\nme nervous and fretful, though I was usually very happy with you. I\r\nwould give a good deal for one of those bad nights now, though at the\r\ntime they were pretty hard upon me....\r\n\r\n\"... Your second summer brings me to the winter that followed. It was\r\nquite a gay winter for us at old South Boston. Marie, the German cook,\r\nmade very nice dishes, and I had many people to dine, and one or two\r\npleasant evening parties. You still slept in my room, and when I was\r\ngoing to a party in the evening, Annie[47] used to bring my nice dress\r\nand my ornaments softly out of the room, that I might dress in the\r\nnursery, and not disturb your slumbers. I was always glad to get home\r\nand undress, and it was always sweet to come to the bed, and find you in\r\nit, sound asleep, and lying right across.... I learned to sleep on a\r\nvery little bit of the bed, you wanted so much of it. This winter, I\r\nbought you a pair of snow-boots, of which you were very proud....\r\n\r\n  [47] The child's faithful nurse.\r\n\r\n\"We all got along happily, dear, till early in April (1863), when your\r\nfather desired me to make a journey with Julia, who needed change of\r\nscene a little. So I had to go and leave you, my sweet of sweets....\r\n\r\n\"We were glad enough to see each other again, you and I, and I felt as\r\nif I could never part with you again. But I was only to have you for a\r\nfew days, my darling....\r\n\r\n\"Thursday I sat up in your nursery, in the afternoon, as I usually did,\r\nwith my book--you having your toys. When I had finished reading, I built\r\nhouses with blocks for you, and rolled the balls and dumbbells across\r\nthe floor to you. You rolled them back to me and this amused you very\r\nmuch. I go to sit up in your nursery in the afternoon now, with my\r\nbook--the light shines in now as it used to do, and I hear the\r\nhand-organ and children's voices in the street. It seems to bring you a\r\nlittle nearer to me, my dear lost one, but not near enough for\r\ncomfort.\"\r\n\r\nThe child's illness and death are described minutely, every symptom,\r\nevery remedy, every anguish noted. Then follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It gives me dreadful pain to recall these things and write them down,\r\nmy dearest. I don't do it to make myself miserable, but in order that I\r\nmay have some lasting record of how you lived and died. You left little\r\nby which you might be remembered, save the love of kindred and friendly\r\nhearts, but in my heart, dear, your precious image is deeply sculptured.\r\nAll my life will be full of grief for you, dearest Boy, and I think that\r\nI shall hardly live as long as I should have lived, if I had had you to\r\nmake me happy. Perhaps it seems very foolish that I should write all\r\nthis, and talk to you in it as if you could know what I write. But, my\r\nlittle darling, it comforts me to think that your sweet soul lives, and\r\nthat you do know something about me. Christ said, 'This day thou shalt\r\nbe with me in Paradise': and he knew that this was no vain promise. So,\r\nbelieving the dear Christ, I am led along to have faith in immortal\r\nlife, of which, dear, I know nothing of myself.\r\n\r\n\"Your little funeral, dear, was bitter and agonizing. The good God does\r\nnot send affliction without comfort, but the weeping eyes and breaking\r\nheart must struggle through much anguish before they can reach it....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no hearse at this little funeral. The small white casket was\r\nplaced on the front seat in the carriage in which she rode.\r\n\r\n\"We came near the gate of Mount Auburn, when I began to realize that the\r\nparting was very near. I now opened the casket, took your dear little\r\ncold hand in mine, and began to take silent farewell of you. And here,\r\ndearest child, I must stop. The remembrance of those last moments so\r\ncuts me to the heart, that I cannot say one word more about them, and\r\nnot much about the life of loneliness and desolation which now began for\r\nme, and of which I do not see the end. God knows why I lost you, and how\r\nI suffer for you, and He knows how and when I shall see you again, as I\r\nhope to do, my dearest, because Christ says we are to live again after\r\nthis life, and I know that if I am immortal, God will not inflict upon\r\nme the pain of an eternal separation from you. So, we shall meet again,\r\nsweet Angel Sammy. God grant that the rest of my life may be worthy of\r\nthis hope, more dear than life itself....\r\n\r\n\"I must finish these words by saying that I am happy in believing that\r\nmy dear Child lives, in a broader land, with better teaching and higher\r\njoys than I could have given him. I hope that the years to come will\r\nbrighten, not efface, my mind's picture of him, and that among these,\r\nthe cipher of one blessed year is already written, in which the picture\r\nwill become reality, and the present sorrow the foundation of an eternal\r\njoy.\"\r\n\r\nThe following stanzas are chosen from among many poems on little Sammy's\r\nlife and death:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                  REMEMBRANCE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  So thou art hid again, and wilt not come\r\n  For any knockings at the veilèd door;\r\n  Nor mother-pangs, nor nature, can restore\r\n  The heart's delight and blossom of thy home.\r\n\r\n  And I with others, in the outer court,\r\n  Must sadly follow the excluding will,\r\n  In painful admiration, of the skill\r\n  Of God, who speaks his sweetest sentence short.\r\n\r\nAt this time she writes to her sister Annie:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot yet write of what has come to me. Chev and I feel that we are\r\nbaptized into a new order of suffering--those who have lost children,\r\nloving them, can never be like those who have not. It makes a new heaven\r\nand a new earth. The new heaven I have not yet--the blow is too rough\r\nand recent. But the new earth, sown with tears, with the beauty and\r\nglory gone out of it, the spring itself, that should have made us happy\r\ntogether, grown tasteless and almost hateful. All the relish of life\r\nseems gone with him. I have no patience to make phrases about it--for\r\nthe moment it seems utterness of doubt and of loss.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt about him. 'This night shalt thou be with me in Paradise' was\r\nsaid by one who knew what he promised. My precious Baby is with the\r\nBeautiful One who was so tender with the children. But I am alone, still\r\nfighting over the dark battle of his death, still questioning whether\r\nthere is any forgiveness for such a death. Something must have been\r\nwrong somewhere--to find it out, I have tortured myself almost out of\r\nsanity. Now I must only say, it is, and look and wait for divine lessons\r\nwhich follow our bitter afflictions.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you all, darling. Ask dear Cogswell to write me a few\r\nlines--tell him that this deep cut makes all my previous life seem\r\nshallow and superficial. Tell him to think of me a little in my great\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\n                                                \"Your loving\r\n                                                         \"JULIA.\"\r\n\r\nShe had by now definitely joined the Unitarian Church, in whose\r\ndoctrines her mind found full and lasting rest; throughout this\r\nsorrowful time the Reverend James Freeman Clarke was one of her kindest\r\nhelpers. Several years before this, she had unwillingly left Theodore\r\nParker's congregation at our father's request. She records in the\r\n\"Reminiscences\" his views on this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"'The children (our two oldest girls) are now of an age at which they\r\nshould receive impressions of reverence. They should, therefore, see\r\nnothing at the Sunday service which militates against that feeling. At\r\nParker's meeting individuals read the newspapers before the exercises\r\nbegin. A good many persons come in after the prayer, and some go out\r\nbefore the conclusion of the sermon. These irregularities offend my\r\nsense of decorum, and appear to me undesirable in the religious\r\neducation of my family.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was a grievous thing to her to make this sacrifice; she said to\r\nHorace Mann that to give up Parker's ministry for any other would be\r\nlike going to the synagogue when Paul was preaching near at hand; yet,\r\nonce made, it was the source of a lifelong joy and comfort.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke was then preaching at Williams Hall; hearing Parker speak of\r\nhim warmly, she determined to attend his services. She found his\r\npreaching \"as unlike as possible to that of Theodore Parker. He had not\r\nthe philosophic and militant genius of Parker, but he had a genius of\r\nhis own, poetical, harmonizing. In after years I esteemed myself\r\nfortunate in having passed from the drastic discipline of the one to the\r\ntender and reconciling ministry of the other.\"\r\n\r\nShe has much to say in the \"Reminiscences\" about the dear \"Saint James,\"\r\nas his friends loved to call him. The relation between them was close\r\nand affectionate: the Church of the Disciples became her spiritual home.\r\n\r\nThese were the days of the Civil War; we must turn back to its opening\r\nyear to record an episode of importance to her and to others.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1861 she went to Washington in company with Governor\r\nand Mrs. Andrew, Mr. Clarke and the Doctor, who was one of the pioneers\r\nof the Sanitary Commission, carrying his restless energy and indomitable\r\nwill from camp to hospital, from battle-field to bureau. She longed to\r\nhelp in some way, but felt that there was nothing she could do--except\r\nmake lint, which we were all doing.\r\n\r\n\"I could not leave my nursery to follow the march of our armies, neither\r\nhad I the practical deftness which the preparing and packing of sanitary\r\nstores demanded. Something seemed to say to me, 'You would be glad to\r\nserve, but you cannot help anyone: you have nothing to give, and there\r\nis nothing for you to do.' Yet, because of my sincere desire, a word\r\nwas given me to say, which did strengthen the hearts of those who fought\r\nin the field and of those who languished in the prison.\"\r\n\r\nReturning from a review of troops near Washington, her carriage was\r\nsurrounded and delayed by the marching regiments: she and her companions\r\nsang, to beguile the tedium of the way, the war songs which every one\r\nwas singing in those days; among them--\r\n\r\n  \"John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave.\r\n          His soul is marching on!\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers liked this, cried, \"Good for you!\" and took up the chorus\r\nwith its rhythmic swing.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Howe,\" said Mr. Clarke, \"why do you not write some good words for\r\nthat stirring tune?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often wished to do so!\" she replied.\r\n\r\nWaking in the gray of the next morning, as she lay waiting for the dawn,\r\nthe word came to her.\r\n\r\n  \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord--\"\r\n\r\nShe lay perfectly still. Line by line, stanza by stanza, the words came\r\nsweeping on with the rhythm of marching feet, pauseless, resistless. She\r\nsaw the long lines swinging into place before her eyes, heard the voice\r\nof the nation speaking through her lips. She waited till the voice was\r\nsilent, till the last line was ended; then sprang from bed, and groping\r\nfor pen and paper, scrawled in the gray twilight the \"Battle Hymn of the\r\nRepublic.\" She was used to writing thus; verses often came to her at\r\nnight, and must be scribbled in the dark for fear of waking the baby;\r\nshe crept back to bed, and as she fell asleep she said to herself, \"I\r\nlike this better than most things I have written.\" In the morning,\r\nwhile recalling the incident, she found she had forgotten the words.\r\n\r\nThe poem was published in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" for February, 1862. \"It\r\nwas somewhat praised,\" she says, \"on its appearance, but the\r\nvicissitudes of the war so engrossed public attention that small heed\r\nwas taken of literary matters.... I knew and was content to know, that\r\nthe poem soon found its way to the camps, as I heard from time to time\r\nof its being sung in chorus by the soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not, however, realize how rapidly the hymn made its way, nor how\r\nstrong a hold it took upon the people. It was \"sung, chanted, recited,\r\nand used in exhortation and prayer on the eve of battle.\" It was printed\r\nin newspapers, in army hymn-books, on broadsides; it was the word of the\r\nhour, and the Union armies marched to its swing.\r\n\r\nAmong the singers of the \"Battle Hymn\" was Chaplain McCabe, the fighting\r\nchaplain of the 122d Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He read the poem in the\r\n\"Atlantic,\" and was so struck with it that he committed it to memory\r\nbefore rising from his chair. He took it with him to the front, and in\r\ndue time to Libby Prison, whither he was sent after being captured at\r\nWinchester. Here, in the great bare room where hundreds of Northern\r\nsoldiers were herded together, came one night a rumor of disaster to the\r\nUnion arms. A great battle, their jailers told them; a great Confederate\r\nvictory. Sadly the Northern men gathered together in groups, sitting or\r\nlying on the floor, talking in low tones, wondering how, where, why.\r\nSuddenly, one of the negroes who brought food for the prisoners stooped\r\nin passing and whispered to one of the sorrowful groups. The news was\r\nfalse: there had, indeed, been a great battle, but the Union army had\r\nwon, the Confederates were defeated and scattered. Like a flame the word\r\nflashed through the prison. Men leaped to their feet, shouted, embraced\r\none another in a frenzy of joy and triumph; and Chaplain McCabe,\r\nstanding in the middle of the room, lifted up his great voice and sang\r\naloud,--\r\n\r\n  \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!\"\r\n\r\nEvery voice took up the chorus, and Libby Prison rang with the shout of\r\n\"Glory, glory, hallelujah!\"\r\n\r\nThe victory was that of Gettysburg. When, some time after, McCabe was\r\nreleased from prison, he told in Washington, before a great audience of\r\nloyal people, the story of his war-time experiences; and when he came to\r\nthat night in Libby Prison, he sang the \"Battle Hymn\" once more. The\r\neffect was magical: people shouted, wept, and sang, all together; and\r\nwhen the song was ended, above the tumult of applause was heard the\r\nvoice of Abraham Lincoln, exclaiming, while the tears rolled down his\r\ncheeks,--\r\n\r\n\"Sing it again!\"\r\n\r\n(Our mother met Lincoln in 1861, and was presented to him by Governor\r\nAndrew. After greeting the party, the President \"seated himself so near\r\nthe famous portrait of Washington by Gilbert Stuart as naturally to\r\nsuggest some comparison between the two figures. On the canvas we saw\r\nthe calm presence, the serene assurance of the man who had successfully\r\naccomplished a great undertaking, a vision of health and of peace. In\r\nthe chair beside it sat a tall, bony figure, devoid of grace, a\r\ncountenance almost redeemed from plainness by two kindly blue eyes, but\r\novershadowed by the dark problems of the moment....\r\n\r\n\"When we had left the presence, one of our number exclaimed, 'Helpless\r\nHonesty!' As if Honesty could ever be helpless.\")\r\n\r\nThe \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" has been translated into Italian,\r\nSpanish, and Armenian. Written in the dark on a scrap of Sanitary\r\nCommission paper, it has been printed in every imaginable form, from the\r\nbeautiful parchment edition presented to the author on her seventieth\r\nbirthday by the New England Woman's Club, down to the cover of a tiny\r\nbrochure advertising a cure for consumption. It has also been set to\r\nmusic many times, but never successfully. It is inseparably wedded to\r\nthe air for which it was written, an air simple, martial, and dignified:\r\nno attempt to divorce the two could ever succeed.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of writing it to that of her death, she was constantly\r\nbesieged by requests for autograph copies of part or the whole of the\r\nhymn. Sometimes the petitioners realized what they asked, as when Edmund\r\nClarence Stedman wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I can well understand what a Frankenstein's monster such a creation\r\ngrows to be--such a poem as the 'Battle Hymn,' when it has become the\r\nsacred scroll of millions, each one of whom would fain obtain a copy of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nReasonable or unreasonable, she tried to meet every such request; no\r\none can ever know how many times she copied the hymn, but if a record\r\nhad been kept, some one with a turn for multiplication might tell us\r\nwhether the lines put together made up a mile, or more, or less.\r\n\r\nShe wrote many other poems of the war, among them \"The Flag,\" which is\r\nto be found in many anthologies. As the \"Battle Hymn\" was the voice of\r\nthe nation's, so this was the expression of her own ardent patriotism:--\r\n\r\n  There's a flag hangs over my threshold\r\n      Whose folds are more dear to me\r\n  Than the blood that thrills in my bosom\r\n      Its earnest of liberty.\r\n\r\n  And dear are the stars it harbors\r\n      In its sunny field of blue,\r\n  As the hope of a further Heaven\r\n      That lights all our dim lives through.\r\n\r\nThis was no figure of speech, but the truth. The war and its mighty\r\nissues filled her heart and mind; she poured out song after song, all\r\nbreathing the spirit of the time, the spirit of hope, resolve,\r\naspiration. Everything she saw connected itself in some way with the\r\ngreat struggle. Seeing her daughters among their young friends, gay as\r\nyouth must be gay, even in war-time, she cries out,--\r\n\r\n  Weave no more silks, ye Lyons looms,\r\n      To deck our girls for gay delights!\r\n  The crimson flower of battle blooms,\r\n      And solemn marches fill the night.\r\n\r\n  Weave but the flag whose bars to-day\r\n      Drooped heavy o'er our early dead,\r\n  And homely garments, coarse and gray,\r\n      For orphans that must earn their bread![48]\r\n\r\n  [48] \"Our Orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Jeweller's Shop in War-Time,\" \"The Battle Eucharist,\" \"The Harvard\r\nStudent's Song,\" all reveal the deep feeling of her heart; we remember\r\nher singing of \"Left Behind\" (set to her own music, a wild, mournful\r\nchant) as something so thrilling that it catches the breath as we think\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nBeing again in Washington in the spring of 1863, she visited the Army of\r\nthe Potomac, in company with the wife of General Francis Barlow, and\r\nwrote on her return a sketch of the expedition. She carried \"a fine\r\nHorace, which repeatedly annoyed me by tumbling in the dirt, a volume of\r\nSully's Memoirs, and a little fag end of Spinoza, being his _Tractat_\r\nupon the Old Testament.\"\r\n\r\nShe saw the working of the Sanitary Commission; saw \"Fighting Joe\"\r\nHooker, who looked like \"the man who can tell nineteen secrets and keep\r\nthe twentieth, which will be the only one worth knowing\"; and William H.\r\nSeward, \"looking singularly like a man who has balanced a chip on the\r\nfence, and who congratulates himself upon its remaining there\"; saw,\r\ntoo, from the heights above Fredericksburg (within the danger line!), an\r\nartillery skirmish.\r\n\r\nDeparting, she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, bristling heights! farewell, sad Fredericksburg! farewell,\r\nriver of sorrows; farewell, soldiers death-determined, upon whose\r\nmournful sacrifice we must shut unwilling eyes. Would it were all at\r\nend! the dead wept and buried, the living justified before God. For the\r\ndeep and terrible secret of the divine idea still lies buried in the\r\nburning bosom of the contest. Suspected by the few, shunned by the many,\r\nit has not as yet leapt to light in the sight of all. This direful\r\ntragedy, in whose third dreary act we are, hangs all upon a great\r\nthought. To interpret this, through waste and woe, is the first moral\r\nobligation of the situation.... This terrible development of moral\r\ncauses and effects will enchain the wonder of the world until the crisis\r\nof poetical justice which must end it shall have won the acquiescence of\r\nmankind, carrying its irresistible lesson into the mind of the critics,\r\ninto the heart of the multitude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nNO. 13 CHESTNUT STREET, BOSTON\r\n\r\n1864; _aet._ 45\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n  Naked and poor thou goest, Philosophy!\r\n  Thy robe of serge hath lain beneath the stars;\r\n  Thy weight of tresses, ponderously free,\r\n  Of iron hue, no golden circlet bars.\r\n\r\n  Thy pale page, Study, by thy side doth hold,\r\n  As by Cyprigna's her persuasive boy:\r\n  Twin sacks thou bear'st; one doth thy gifts infold,\r\n  Whose modest tendering proves immortal joy.\r\n\r\n  The other at thy patient back doth hang\r\n  To keep the boons thou'rt wonted to receive:\r\n  Reproof therein doth hide her venomed fang,\r\n  And hard barbaric arts, that mock and grieve.\r\n\r\n  Here is a stab, and here a mortal thrust;\r\n  Here galley service brought the age to loss;\r\n  Here lies thy virgin forehead rolled in dust\r\n  Beside the martyr stake of hero cross.\r\n\r\n  They who besmirched thy whiteness with their pitch,\r\n  Thy gallery of glories did complete;\r\n  They who accepted of thee so grew rich,\r\n  Men could not count their treasures in the street.\r\n\r\n  Thy hollow cheek, and eye of distant light,\r\n  Won from the chief of men their noblest love;\r\n  Olympian feasts thy temperance requite,\r\n  And thy worn weeds a priceless dowry prove.\r\n\r\n  I know not if I've caught the matchless mood\r\n  In which impassioned Petrarch sang of thee;\r\n  But this I know,--the world its plenitude\r\n  May keep, so I may share thy beggary.\r\n\r\n                                            J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the two real homes, Green Peace and Lawton's Valley, the Chestnut\r\nStreet house was nearest to our hearts; this, though we were there only\r\nthree years, and though it was there that we children first saw the face\r\nof sorrow. It was an heroic time. The Doctor was in constant touch with\r\nthe events of the war. He was sent by Governor Andrew to examine\r\nconditions of camps and hospitals, in Massachusetts and at the seat of\r\nwar; he worked as hard on the Sanitary Commission, to which he had been\r\nappointed by President Lincoln, as on any other of his multifarious\r\nlabors: his knowledge of practical warfare and his grasp of situations\r\ngave him a foresight of coming events which seemed well-nigh miraculous.\r\nWhen he entered the house, we all felt the electric touch, found\r\nourselves in the circuit of the great current.\r\n\r\nSo, these three years were notable for us all, especially for our\r\nmother; for beside these vital interests, she was entering upon another\r\nphase of development. Heretofore her life had been domestic, studious,\r\nsocial; her chief relation with the public had been through her pen. She\r\nnow felt the need of personal contact with her audience; felt that she\r\nmust speak her message. She says in her \"Reminiscences\": \"In the days of\r\nwhich I now write, it was borne in upon me (as the Friends say) that I\r\nhad much to say to my day and generation which could not and should not\r\nbe communicated in rhyme, or even in rhythm.\"\r\n\r\nThe character of the message, too, was changing. In the anguish of\r\nbereavement she sought relief in study, her lifelong resource. Religion\r\nand philosophy went hand in hand with her. She read Spinoza eagerly:\r\nread Fichte, Hegel, Schelling; finally, found in Immanuel Kant a prophet\r\nand a friend. But it was not enough for her to receive; she must also\r\ngive out: her nature was radiant. She must formulate a philosophy of her\r\nown, and must at least offer it to the world.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1863, she writes to her sister Louisa, \"My Ethics are now\r\nthe joke of my family, and Flossy or any child, wishing a second\r\nhelping, will say: 'Is it ethical, Mamma?' Too much of my life, indeed,\r\nruns in this channel. I can only hope that the things I write may do\r\ngood to somebody, how much or how little we ourselves are unable to\r\nmeasure.\"\r\n\r\nYet she could make fun of her philosophers: _vide_ the following passage\r\nfrom one of her \"Tribune\" letters:--\r\n\r\n\"We like to make a clean cut occasionally, and distinguish ourselves\r\nfrom our surroundings. Else, we and they get so wedded that we scarcely\r\nknow ourselves apart. Do I own these four walls, or do they own me, and\r\ndetain me here for their pleasure and preservation? Do I want these\r\nbooks, or do their ghostly authors seize me wandering near the shelves,\r\nimpanel me by the button-hole, and insist upon pouring their bottled-up\r\nwisdom into my passive mind? I once read a terrible treatise of Fichte\r\nupon the _me and not me_, in which he gave so many reasons why I could\r\nnot be the washstand, nor the washstand I, that I began after a while to\r\ndoubt the fact. Had I read further, I think I should never have known\r\nmyself from house-furniture again. Let me here remark that many of\r\nthese gymnastics of German metaphysics seem to have no other office than\r\nthat of harmlessly emptying the brain of all its electricity. Their\r\nbattery strikes no hammer, turns no wheel. Fichte, having decided that\r\nhe was not the washstand, smoked, took beer, and walked out to meet some\r\nphilosophic friend, who, viewing himself _inclusive___, as the Germans\r\nsay, thought he might be that among other things. Fatherland meantime\r\ngoing to the Devil--strong hands wanted, clear, practical\r\nbrains,--infinitesimal oppression to be undermined, the century helped\r\non. 'I am not the washstand,' says Fichte; 'I am everything,' says\r\nHegel. Fatherland, take care of yourself. Yet who shall say that it is\r\nnot a vital point to know our real selves from the factitious\r\npersonalities imposed upon us, and to distinguish between the symptoms\r\nof our fancy and the valid phenomena of our lives?\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal says:--\r\n\r\n\"At 11.53 [September 24] finished my Essay on Religion, for the power to\r\nproduce which I thank God. I believe that I have in this built up a\r\ngreater coherence between things natural and things divine than I have\r\nseen or heard made out after this sort by anyone else. I therefore\r\nrejoice over my work, ... hoping it may be of service to others, as it\r\nhas certainly been to me.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later she adds, \"I leave this record of my opinion of my work,\r\nbut on reading it aloud to Paddock,[49] I found the execution of the\r\ntask to have fallen far short of my conception of it. I shall try to\r\nrewrite much of the Essay.\"\r\n\r\n  [49] Miss Mary Paddock, our father's devoted amanuensis: one of the\r\n  earliest and best-loved teachers at the Perkins Institution; often our\r\n  mother's good helper; the faithful and lifelong friend of us all.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of 1864 is a quarto volume, with a full page for every day.\r\nThere are many blank pages, but the record is much fuller than\r\nheretofore.\r\n\r\n\"_January 15._ Worked all the afternoon at my Essay on Distinction\r\nbetween Philosophy and Religion. Got a bad feeling from fatigue. A sort\r\nof trembling agony in my back and left side.\"\r\n\r\nYet she went to the opera in the evening, and saw \"Faust,\" a\r\n\"composition with more faults than merits.\" She concludes the entry with\r\n\"_Dilige et relinque_ is a good motto for some things.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday, January 17._ It was announced from the pulpit that an Essay on\r\nthe Soul and Body would be read by a friend at Wednesday evening\r\nmeeting. That friend was myself, that essay my Lecture on Duality. This\r\nwould be an honor, but for my ill-deserts. Be witness, O God! that this\r\nis no imaginary or sentimental exclamation, but a feeling too well\r\nfounded on fact.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the lecture she writes: \"Mr. Clarke introduced me charmingly. I\r\nwore my white cap, not wishing to read in my thick bonnet. I had quite a\r\nfull audience.... I consider this opportunity a great honor and\r\nprivilege conferred upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 28._ At a quarter before 2 P.M. finished my Essay on\r\nPhilosophy and Religion. I thank God for this, for many infirmities,\r\nsome physical, some moral, have threatened to interrupt my work. It is\r\ndone, and if it is all I am to do, I am ready to die, since life now\r\nmeans work of my best sort, and I value little else, except the comfort\r\nof my family. Now for a little rest!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"rest\" of the following day consisted in paying eight visits between\r\ntwelve and two o'clock and going to the opera in the evening.\r\n\r\nShe now began to read her philosophical essays aloud to a chosen circle\r\nof friends gathered in the parlor of No. 13 Chestnut Street. After one\r\nof these occasions she says: \"Professor Rogers took me up sharply (not\r\nin temper), on my first statement and definition of Polarity. I suffered\r\nin this, but was bound to take it in good part. A thoroughbred dog can\r\nbear to be lifted by the ear without squealing. Endurance is a test of\r\nbreeding....\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 27, 1864._ My birthday; forty-five years old. This year, begun in\r\nintolerable distress, has been, I think, the most valuable one of my\r\nlife. Paralyzed at first by Sammy's death, I soon found my only refuge\r\nfrom grief in increased activity after my kind. When he died I had\r\nwritten two-thirds of 'Proteus.' As soon as I was able, I wrote the\r\nremaining portion which treats of affection. At Newport I wrote my\r\nIntroductory Lecture on 'How _Not_ to Teach Ethics,' then 'Duality of\r\nCharacter,' then my first Lecture on Religion. Returned from Newport, I\r\nwrote my second and third essays on Religion. I read the six essays of\r\nmy first course to a large circle of friends at my own house, not asking\r\nany payment. This done, I began to write a long essay on Polarity which\r\nis only partially completed, intending also to write on Limitations and\r\nthe three degrees, should it be given to me to do so. I have read and\r\nre-read Spinoza's Ethics within the last thirteen months. His method in\r\nthe arrangement of thought and motive has been of great use to me, but I\r\nthink that I have been able to give them an extended application and\r\nsome practical illustrations which did not lie within his scope.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day she writes: \"Dreamed of dearest Sammy. Thought that he was\r\nin the bed, and that I was trying to nurse him in the dark as I have so\r\noften done. I thought that when his little lips had found my breast,\r\nsomething said in my ear, 'My life's life--the glory of the world.'\r\nQuoting from my lines on Mary Booth. This woke me with a sudden\r\nimpression, _Thus Nature remembers_.\"\r\n\r\nShe decided this spring to read some of her essays in Washington. There\r\nwere various difficulties in the way, and she was uncertain of the\r\noutcome of the enterprise. She writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I leave Bordentown [the home of her sister Annie] with a resolute, not\r\na sanguine heart. I have no one to stand for me there, Sumner against\r\nme, Channing almost unknown to me, everyone else indifferent. I go in\r\nobedience to a deep and strong impulse which I do not understand nor\r\nexplain, but whose bidding I cannot neglect. The satisfaction of having\r\nat last obeyed this interior guide is all that keeps me up, for no one,\r\nso far as I know, altogether approves of my going.\"\r\n\r\nSpite of these doubts and fears, the enterprise was successful. Perhaps\r\npeople were glad to shut their ears for a moment to the sound of cannon\r\nand the crying of \"Latest news from the front!\" and listen to the quiet\r\nwords of philosophic thought and suggestion.\r\n\r\nSide by side with work, as usual, went play. In January she records the\r\nfirst meeting of the new club, the \"Ladies' Social,\" at the home of Mrs.\r\nJosiah Quincy. This club of clever people, familiarly known as the\r\n\"Brain Club,\" was for many years one of her great pleasures. Mrs. Quincy\r\nwas its first president. It may have been at this meeting that our\r\nmother, being asked to present in a few words the nature and object of\r\nthe club, addressed the company as follows: \"Ladies and Gentlemen; this\r\nclub has been formed for the purpose of carrying on\"--she paused, and\r\nbegan to twinkle--\"for the purpose of _carrying on_!\"\r\n\r\nShe describes briefly a meeting of the club at 13 Chestnut Street:--\r\n\r\n\"Entertained my Club with two charades. _Pan-demon-ium_ was the first,\r\n_Catastrophe_ __the second. For _Pan_ I recited some verses of Mrs.\r\nBrowning's 'Dead Pan,' with the gods she mentions in the background, my\r\nown boy as Hermes. For 'Demon' I had a female Faust and a female Satan.\r\nWas aided by Fanny McGregor, Alice Howe, Hamilton Wilde, Charles\r\nCarroll, and James C. Davis, with my Flossy, who looked beautifully. The\r\nentertainment was voted an entire success.\"\r\n\r\nWe remember these charades well. The words\r\n\r\n  \"Aphrodite, dead and driven\r\n    As thy native foam thou art ...\"\r\n\r\ncall up the vision of Fanny McGregor, white and beautiful, lying on a\r\nwhite couch in an attitude of perfect grace.\r\n\r\nWe hear our mother's voice reciting the stately verses. We see her as\r\nthe \"female Faust,\" first bending over her book, then listening\r\nentranced to the promises of Mephistopheles, finally vanishing behind a\r\ncurtain from which the next instant sprang Florence (the one child who\r\nresembled her) in all the gayety of her bright youth.\r\n\r\nThe next day she was, \"Very weary all day. Put things to rights as well\r\nas I could. Read in Spinoza, Cotta, and Livy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was for the Brain Club that she wrote \"The Socio-Maniac,\" a cantata\r\ncaricaturing fashionable society. She set the words to music, and sang\r\nwith much solemnity the \"Mad Song\" of the heroine whose brain had been\r\nturned by too much gayety:--\r\n\r\n  \"Her mother was a Shaw,\r\n    And her father was a Tompkins;\r\n  Her sister was a bore,\r\n    And her brother was a bumpkin;\r\n      Oh! Soci--oh! Soci--\r\n      Oh! Soci--e--ty!\r\n\r\n  \"Her flounces were of gold,\r\n    And her slippers were of ermine;\r\n  And she looked a little bold\r\n    When she rose to lead the Germin;\r\n      Oh! Soci--oh! Soci--\r\n      Oh! Soci--e--ty!\r\n\r\n  \"For my part I never saw\r\n    Where she kept her fascination;\r\n  But I thought she had an aw-\r\n    Ful conceit and affectation;\r\n      Oh! Soci--oh! Soci--\r\n      Oh! Soci--e--ty!\"\r\n\r\nNew interests were constantly arising. In these days Edwin Booth made\r\nhis first appearance in Boston. Our mother and father went to the Boston\r\nTheatre one rainy evening, \"expecting to see nothing more than an\r\nordinary performance. The play was 'Richelieu,' and we had seen but\r\nlittle of Mr. Booth's part in it before we turned to each other and\r\nsaid, 'This is the real thing!'\"\r\n\r\nThen they saw him in \"Hamlet\" and realized even more fully that a star\r\nhad risen. He seemed\r\n\r\n  ... beautiful as dreams of maidenhood,\r\n      That doubt defy,\r\n  Young Hamlet, with his forehead grief-subdued,\r\n      And visioning eye.[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] \"Hamlet at the Boston,\" _Later Lyrics_, 1866.\r\n\r\nMr. Booth's manager asked her to write a play for the young tragedian.\r\nShe gladly consented; Booth himself came to see her; she found him\r\n\"modest, intelligent, and above all genuine,--the man as worthy of\r\nadmiration as the artist.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the range of classic fiction, to which her mind naturally turned,\r\nno character seemed to fit him so well as that of Hippolytus; his\r\naustere beauty, his reserve and shyness, all seemed to her the\r\npersonification of the hunter-prince, beloved of Artemis, and she chose\r\nthis theme for her play.\r\n\r\nThe writing of \"Hippolytus\" was accomplished under difficulties. She\r\nsays of it:--\r\n\r\n\"I had at this time and for many years afterward a superstition about a\r\nnorth light. My eyes had given me some trouble, and I felt obliged to\r\nfollow my literary work under circumstances most favorable for their\r\nuse. The exposure of our little farmhouse [at Lawton's Valley] was south\r\nand west, and its only north light was derived from a window at the top\r\nof the attic stairs. Here was a platform just large enough to give room\r\nfor a table two feet square. The stairs were shut off from the rest of\r\nthe house by a stout door. And here, through the summer heats, and in\r\nspite of many wasps, I wrote my five-act drama, dreaming of the fine\r\nemphasis which Mr. Booth would give to its best passages and of the\r\nbeautiful appearance he would make in classic costume. He, meanwhile,\r\nwas growing into great fame and favor with the public, and was called\r\nhither and thither by numerous engagements. The period of his courtship\r\nand marriage[51] intervened, and a number of years elapsed between the\r\ncompletion of the play and his first reading of it.\"\r\n\r\n  [51] To Mary Devlin, an actress of great charm.\r\n\r\nAt last the time seemed ripe for the production of the play. E. L.\r\nDavenport, the actor manager of the Howard Athenæum, agreed to produce\r\nit: Charlotte Cushman was to play Phædra to Booth's Hippolytus.\r\nRehearsals began, the author's dream seemed close upon fulfilment. Then\r\ncame a slip never fully explained: the manager suddenly discovered that\r\nthe subject of the play was a painful one; other reasons were given, but\r\nnone that appeared sufficient to author or actors.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said Miss Cushman, \"if Edwin Booth and I had done nothing\r\nmore than stand upon the stage and say 'good evening' to each other, the\r\nhouse would have been filled.\"\r\n\r\nBriefly, the play was withdrawn. Our mother says: \"This was, I think,\r\nthe greatest 'let down' that I ever experienced. It affected me\r\nseriously for some days, after which I determined to attempt nothing\r\nmore for the stage.\"\r\n\r\nShe never forgot the play nor her bitter disappointment.\r\n\r\nMany memories cluster about the gracious figure of Edwin Booth. He came\r\noften--for so shy and retiring a man--to the Chestnut Street house. We\r\nchildren all worshipped at his shrine; the elder girls worked his\r\ninitials on the under side of the chair in which he once sat, which was\r\nthereafter like no other chair; the younger ones gazed in round-eyed\r\nadmiration, but the great man had eyes for one only of us all. We gave a\r\nparty for him, and Beacon Street came in force to meet the brilliant\r\nyoung actor. Alas! the brilliant young actor, after the briefest and\r\nshyest of greetings to the company, retired into a corner with\r\neight-year-old Maud, where he sat on the floor making dolls and rabbits\r\nout of his pocket handkerchief!\r\n\r\nThis recalls an oft-quoted anecdote of the time. Our mother wished\r\nCharles Sumner to see and know Booth. One evening when the Senator was\r\nat the house, she told him of her wish. The next day she writes in her\r\nJournal: \"Sumner to tea. Made a rude speech on being asked to meet\r\nBooth. Said: 'I don't know that I should care to meet him. I have\r\noutlived my interest in individuals.' Fortunately, God Almighty had not,\r\nby last accounts, got so far.\"\r\n\r\nSumner was told of this in her presence. \"What a strange sort of book,\"\r\nhe exclaimed, \"your diary must be! You ought to strike that out\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\nShe admired Charles Sumner heartily, but they disagreed on many points.\r\nHe disapproved of women's speaking in public (as did the Doctor),\r\nand--with wholly kind intentions--did what he could to prevent her\r\ngiving the above-mentioned readings in Washington. She notes this in her\r\nJournal.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote him a very warm letter, but with no injurious phrase, as I felt\r\nonly grief and indignation, not dis-esteem, towards him. Yet the fact of\r\nhaving written the letter became extremely painful to me, when it was\r\nonce beyond recall. I could not help writing a second on the day\r\nfollowing, to apologize for the roughness of the first. This was a\r\ndiplomatic fault, I think, but one inseparable from my character. C.S.'s\r\nreply, which I dreaded to read, was very kind. While I clearly saw his\r\nmisapprehension of the whole matter, I saw also the thorough kindliness\r\nand sincerity of his nature. So we disagree, but I love him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner did not attend the readings, but he came to see her, and was,\r\nas always, kind and friendly. After seeing him in the Senate she writes:\r\n\"Sumner looks up and smiles. That smile seems to illuminate the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nAnother passage in the Journal of March, 1864, is in a different note:\r\n\"Maggie ill and company to dinner. I washed breakfast things, cleared\r\nthe table, walked, read Spinoza a little, then had to 'fly round,' as my\r\ndinner was an early one. Picked a grouse, and saw to various matters.\r\nCompany came, a little early. The room was cold. Hedge, Palfrey, and\r\nAlger to dinner. Conversation pleasant, but dinner late, and not well\r\nserved. Palfrey and Hedge read Parker's Latin epitaph on Chev, amazed at\r\nthe bad Latinity.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn June, 1864, a Russian squadron, sent to show Russia's good-will\r\ntoward the United States, dropped anchor in Boston Harbor, and\r\nhospitable Boston rose up in haste to receive the strangers. Dr. Holmes\r\nwrote a song beginning,--\r\n\r\n  \"Seabirds of Muscovy,\r\n    Rest in our waters,\"--\r\n\r\nwhich was sung to the Russian national air at a public reception.\r\n\r\nOur mother for once made no \"little verse,\" but she saw a good deal of\r\nthe Russian officers; gave parties for them, and attended various\r\nfunctions and festivities on board the ships. On Sunday, June 22, she\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n\"To mass on board the Oslaba.... The service was like the Armenian\r\nEaster I saw in Rome.... It is a sacrifice to God instead of a lesson\r\nfrom Him, which after all makes the difference between the old religions\r\nand the true Christian. For even Judaism is heathen compared with\r\nChristianity. Yet I found this very consoling, as filling out the\r\nverities of religious development. I seemed to hear in the responses a\r\ngreat harmony in which the first man had the extreme bass and the last\r\nborn babe the extreme treble. Theo. Parker and my dear Sammy were\r\nblended in it.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after this the \"seabirds of Muscovy\" departed; then came the\r\nflitting to Newport, and a summer of steady work.\r\n\r\n\"Read Paul in the Valley. Thought of writing a review of his first two\r\nepistles from the point of view of the common understanding. The clumsy\r\nWestern mind has made such literal and material interpretations of the\r\nOriental finesses of the New Testament, that the present coarse and\r\nmonstrous beliefs, so far behind the philosophical, æsthetic, and\r\nnatural culture of the age, is imposed by the authority of the few upon\r\nthe ignorance of the many, and stands a monument of the stupidity of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"Paul's views of the natural man are, inevitably, much colored by the\r\ncurrent bestiality of the period. To apply his expressions to the\r\ninnocent and inevitable course of Nature is coarse, unjust, and\r\ndemoralizing, because confusing to the moral sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to the conclusion to-day that an heroic intention is not to be\r\nkept in sight without much endeavor. Now that I have finished at least\r\none portion of my Ethics and Dynamics, I find myself thinking how to get\r\njust credit for it, rather than how to make my work most useful to\r\nothers. The latter must, however, be my object, and shall be. Did not\r\nChev so discourage it, I should feel bound to give these lectures\r\npublicly, being, as they are, a work for the public. I do not as yet\r\ndecide what to do with them.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to 13 Chestnut Street, she found a multiplicity of work\r\nawaiting her. Ethics had to stand aside and make way for Poetry and\r\nPhilanthropy. New York was to celebrate the seventieth birthday of\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant; she was asked to write a poem for the occasion.\r\nThis she did joyfully, composing and arranging the stanzas mostly in the\r\ntrain between Newport and Boston.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the celebration, she took an early train for New York: Dr.\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes was on the train. \"I will sit by you, Mrs. Howe,\"\r\nhe said, \"but I must not talk! I am going to read a poem at the Bryant\r\ncelebration, and must save my voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means let us keep silent,\" she replied. \"I also have a poem to\r\nread at the Bryant Celebration.\"\r\n\r\nDescribing this scene she says, \"The dear Doctor, always my friend,\r\noverestimated his power of abstinence from the interchange of thought\r\nwhich was so congenial to him. He at once launched forth in his own\r\nbrilliant vein, and we were within a few miles of our destination when\r\nwe suddenly remembered that we had not taken time to eat our luncheon.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft met them at the station, carried her trunk himself (\"a\r\nsmall one!\"), and put her into his own carriage. The reception was in\r\nthe Century Building. She entered on Mr. Bryant's arm, and sat between\r\nhim and Mr. Bancroft on the platform. The Journal tells us:--\r\n\r\n\"After Mr. Emerson's remarks my poem was announced. I stepped to the\r\nmiddle of the platform, and read my poem. I was full of it, and read it\r\nwell, I think, as every one heard me, and the large room was crammed.\r\nThe last two verses--not the best--were applauded.... This was, I\r\nsuppose, the greatest public honor of my life. I record it for my\r\ngrandchildren.\"\r\n\r\nThe November pages of the Journal are blank, but on that for November 21\r\nis pasted a significant note. It is from the secretary of the National\r\nSailors' Fair, and conveys the thanks of the Board of Managers to Mrs.\r\nHowe \"for her great industry and labor in editing the 'Boatswain's\r\nWhistle.'\"\r\n\r\nNeither Journal nor \"Reminiscences\" has one word to say about fair or\r\npaper; yet both were notable. The great war-time fairs were far more\r\nthan a device for raising money. They were festivals of patriotism;\r\npeople bought and sold with a kind of sacred ardor. This fair was\r\nBoston's contribution toward the National Sailors' Home. It was held in\r\nthe Boston Theatre, which for a week was transformed into a wonderful\r\nhive of varicolored bees, all \"workers,\" all humming and hurrying. The\r\n\"Boatswain's Whistle\" was the organ of the fair. There were ten numbers\r\nof the paper: it lies before us now, a small folio volume of eighty\r\npages.\r\n\r\nTitle and management are indicated at the top of the first column:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOATSWAIN'S WHISTLE.\r\n\r\n         -----------------\r\n         Editorial Council.\r\n\r\n  Edward Everett.        A. P. Peabody.\r\n\r\n  John G. Whittier.      J. R. Lowell.\r\n\r\n  O. W. Holmes.          E. P. Whipple.\r\n\r\n         -----------------\r\n              Editor.\r\n\r\n          Julia Ward Howe.\r\n\r\nEach member of the Council made at least one contribution to the paper;\r\nbut the burden fell on the Editor's shoulders. She worked day and night;\r\nno wonder that the pages of the Journal are blank. Beside the editorials\r\nand many other unsigned articles, she wrote a serial story, \"The Journal\r\nof a Fancy Fair,\" which brings back vividly the scene it describes. In\r\nthose days the raffle was not discredited. Few people realized that it\r\nwas a crude form of gambling; clergy and laity alike raffled merrily.\r\nOur mother, however, in her story speaks through the lips of her hero a\r\npungent word on the subject:--\r\n\r\n\"The raffle business is, I suppose, the great humbug of occasions of\r\nthis kind. It seems to me very much like taking a front tooth from a\r\ncertain number of persons in order to make up a set of teeth for a party\r\nwho wants it and who does not want to pay for it.\"\r\n\r\nWe should like to linger over the pages of the \"Boatswain's Whistle\"; to\r\nquote from James Freeman Clarke's witty dialogues, Edward Everett's\r\nstately periods, Dr. Holmes's sparkling verse; to describe General\r\nGrant, the prize ox, white as driven snow and weighing 3900 pounds,\r\npresented by the owner to President Lincoln and by him to the fair. Did\r\nwe not see him drawn in triumph through Boston streets on an open car,\r\nand realize in an instant--fresh from our \"Wonder-Book\"--what Europa's\r\nbull looked like?\r\n\r\nBut of all the treasures of the little paper, we must content ourselves\r\nwith this dispatch:--\r\n\r\nAllow me to wish you a great success. With the old fame of the navy made\r\nbright by the present war, you cannot fail. I name none lest I wrong\r\nothers by omission. To all, from Rear Admiral to honest Jack, I tender\r\nthe nation's admiration and gratitude.\r\n\r\n                                                      A.

W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war was nearly over, and all hearts were with Grant and Lee in their\r\nlong duel before Richmond. Patriotism and philosophy together ruled our\r\nmother's life in these days; the former more apparent in her daily walk\r\namong us, the latter in the quiet hours with her Journal.\r\n\r\nThe Journal for 1865 is much fuller than that of 1864; the record of\r\nevents is more regular, and we find more and more reflection,\r\nmeditation, and speculation. The influence of Kant is apparent; the\r\nentries become largely notes of study, to take final shape in lectures\r\nand essays.\r\n\r\n\"A morning visit received in study hours is a sickness from which the\r\nday does not recover. I can neither afford to be idle, nor to have\r\nfriends who are so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man is impelled by inward force, regulated by outward circumstance. He\r\nis inspired from within, moralized from without.... A man may be devout\r\nin himself, but he can be moral only in his relation with other men....\"\r\n\r\n\"Early to Mary Dorr's, to consult about the Charade. Read Kant and wrote\r\nas usual. Spent the afternoon in getting up my costumes for the Charade.\r\nThe word was Au-thor-ship.... Authorship was expressed by my appearing\r\nas a great composer, Jerry Abbott performing my Oratorio--a very comical\r\nthing, indeed. The whole was a success.\"\r\n\r\nNo one who saw the \"Oratorio\" can forget it. Mr. Abbott, our neighbor in\r\nChestnut Street, was a comedian who would have adorned any stage. The\r\n\"book\" of the Oratorio was a simple rhyme of Boston authorship.\r\n\r\n  \"Abigail Lord,\r\n  Of her own accord,\r\n  Went down to see her sister,\r\n  When Jason Lee,\r\n  As brisk as a flea,\r\n  He hopped right up and kissed her.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, an umbrella, and a chair held before him like a\r\nvioloncello, Mr. Abbott gave a truly Handelian performance. Fugue and\r\ncounterpoint, first violin and bass tuba, solo and full chorus, all were\r\nrendered with a _verve_ and spirit which sent the audience into\r\nconvulsions of laughter.--This was one of the \"carryings-on\" of the\r\nBrain Club. After another such occasion our mother writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Very weary and aching a little. I must keep out of these tomfooleries,\r\nthough they have their uses. They are much better than some other social\r\nentertainments, as after all they present some æsthetic points of\r\ninterest. They are better than scandal, gluttony, or wild dancing. But\r\nthe artists and I have still better things to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 23._ It is always legitimate to wish to rise above one's self,\r\nnever above others. In this, however, as in other things, we must\r\nremember the maxim: '_Natura nil facit per saltum_.' All true rising\r\nmust be gradual and laborious, in such wise that the men of to-morrow\r\nshall look down almost imperceptibly upon the men of to-day. All sudden\r\nelevations are either imaginary or factitious. If you had not a kingly\r\nmind before your coronation, no crown will make a king of you. The true\r\nking is somewhere, starving or hiding, very like. For the true value\r\nwhich the counterfeit represents exists somewhere. The world has much\r\ndodging about to produce the real value and escape the false one.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the Journal, we find a revelation of the conflict in this\r\nstrangely dual nature. Her study was, she thought, her true home; yet no\r\none who saw her in society would have dreamed that she was making an\r\neffort: _nor was she_! She gave herself up entirely to the work or the\r\nplay of the hour. She was a many-sided crystal: every aspect of life met\r\nits answering flash. The glow of human intercourse kindled her to flame;\r\nbut when the flame had cooled, the need of solitude and study lay on her\r\nwith twofold poignancy. She went through life in double harness, thought\r\nand feeling abreast; though often torn between the two, in the main she\r\ngave free rein to both, trusting the issue to God.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1864-65 was an arduous one. She was writing new\r\nphilosophical essays, and reading them before various circles of\r\nfriends. The larger audience which she craved was not for the moment\r\nattainable. She was studying deeply, reading Latin by way of relaxation,\r\ngoing somewhat into society (Julia and Florence being now of the dancing\r\nage), and entertaining a good deal in a quiet way. In February she\r\nwrites: \"Much tormented by interruptions. Could not get five quiet\r\nminutes at a time. Everybody torments me with every smallest errand. And\r\nI am trying to study philosophy!\"\r\n\r\nProbably we were troublesome children and made more noise than we\r\nshould. Her accurate ear for music was often a source of distress to\r\nher, as one of us can witness, an indolent child who neglected her\r\npractising. As this child drummed over her scales, the door of the\r\nupstairs study would open, and a clear voice come ringing down, \"_B\r\nflat_, dear, _not_ B natural!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the child a miracle; she, with the book before her, could\r\nnot get it right: \"Mamma,\" studying Kant upstairs behind closed doors,\r\nknew what the note should be.\r\n\r\n\"Few of us consider the wide and laborious significance of the simplest\r\nformulas we employ. 'I love you!' opens out a long vista of labor and\r\nendeavor; otherwise it means: 'I love myself and need you.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"Played all last evening for Laura's company to dance. My heart flutters\r\nto-day. It is a feeling unknown to me until lately.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Laura would have gone barefoot in snow to save her mother pain or\r\nfatigue; yet she has no recollection of ever questioning the\r\ninevitability of \"Mamma's\" playing for all youthful dancing. Grown-up\r\nparties were different; for them there were hired musicians, who made\r\ninferior music; but for the frolics of the early 'teens, who _should_\r\nplay except \"Mamma\"?\r\n\r\nOn March 10, she writes: \"I have now been too long in my study. I must\r\nbreak out into real life, and learn some more of its lessons.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later a lesson began: \"I stay from church to-day to take care\r\nof Maud, who is quite unwell. This is a sacrifice, although I am bound\r\nand glad to make it. But I shall miss the church all the week.\"\r\n\r\nThe child became so ill that \"all pursuits had to be given up in the\r\ncare of her.\" The Journal gives a minute account of this illness, and of\r\nthe remedies used, among them \"long-continued and gentle friction with\r\nthe hand.\" The words bring back the touch of her hand, which was like no\r\nother. There were no trained nurses in our nursery, rarely any doctor\r\nsave \"Papa,\" but \"Mamma\" rubbed us, and that was a whole\r\npharmacopoeia in itself.\r\n\r\nAt this time she gave her first public lecture before the Parker\r\nFraternity. This was an important event to her; she had earnestly\r\ndesired yet greatly dreaded it. She found the hall pleasant, the\r\naudience attentive. \"When I came to read the lecture,\" she says, \"I felt\r\nthat it had a value.\"\r\n\r\n\"All these things in my mind point one way, viz.: towards the adoption\r\nof a profession of Ethical exposition, after my sort.\"\r\n\r\nShe had been asked to give a lecture at Tufts College, and says of this:\r\n\"The difficulties are great, the question is to me one of simple duty.\r\nIf I am sent for, and have the word to say, I should say it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again: \"I determine that I can only be good in fulfilling my highest\r\nfunction--all else implies waste of power, leading to demoralization.\"\r\n\r\nShe declined the invitation, \"feeling unable to decide in favor of\r\naccepting it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I was sorry,\" she says, \"and I remembered the words: 'He that hath\r\nput his hand to the plough and looketh back is not fit for the kingdom\r\nof heaven.' God keep me from so looking back!\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal of this spring is largely devoted to philosophic\r\nspeculations and commentaries on Kant, whose theories she finds more and\r\nmore luminous and convincing; now and then comes a note of her own:--\r\n\r\n\"'I am God!' says the fool. 'I see God!' says the wise man. For while\r\nyou are your own supreme, you are your own God, and self-worship is true\r\natheism.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is better to use a bad man by his better side than a good man by his\r\nworse side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ said that he was older than Abraham. I think that he used this\r\nexpression as a measure of value. His thoughts were further back in the\r\nprimal Ideal necessity. He did not speak of any personal life antedating\r\nhis own existence.... In his own sense, Christ was also newer than we\r\nare, for his doctrine is still beyond the attainment of all and the\r\nappreciation of most of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no essential religious element in negation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saw Booth in 'Hamlet'--still first-rate, I think, although he has\r\nplayed it one hundred nights in New York. 'Hamlet' is an æsthetic\r\nEvangel. I know of no direct ethical work which contains such powerful\r\nmoral illustration and instruction.\"\r\n\r\n\"James Freeman [Clarke] does not think much of Sam's book, probably not\r\nas well as it deserves. But the knowledge of Sam's personality is the\r\nlight behind the transparency in all that he does.\"[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] _Lyrical Ventures_, by Samuel Ward.\r\n\r\nThese were the closing months of the Civil War. All hearts were lifted\r\nup in thankfulness that the end was near. She speaks of it seldom, but\r\nher few words are significant.\r\n\r\n\"_Monday, April 3...._ Richmond was taken this morning. _Laus Deo!_\"\r\n\r\nOn April 10, after \"Maud's boots, $3.00, Vegetables, .12, Bread, .04,\"\r\nwe read, \"Ribbons for victory, .40. To-day we have the news of Lee's\r\nsurrender with the whole remnant of his army. The city is alive with\r\npeople. All flags hung out--shop windows decorated--processions in the\r\nstreet. All friends meet and shake hands. On the newspaper bulletins\r\nsuch placards as '_Gloria in excelsis Deo_,' 'Thanks be to God!' We all\r\ncall it the greatest day of our lives.\r\n\r\n\"Apples, half-peck, .50.\"\r\n\r\nThat week was one of joy and thankfulness for all. Thursday was Fast\r\nDay; she \"went to church to fatigue Satan. Afterwards made a visit to\r\nMrs. ---- who did not seem to have tired her devil out.\"\r\n\r\nThe joy bells were soon to be silenced. Saturday, April 15, was\r\n\r\n\"A black day in history, though outwardly most fair. President Lincoln\r\nwas assassinated in his box at the theatre, last evening, by J. Wilkes\r\nBooth. This atrocious act, which was consummated in a very theatrical\r\nmanner, is enough to ruin not the Booth family alone, but the theatrical\r\nprofession. Since my Sammy's death, nothing has happened that has given\r\nme so much personal pain as this event. The city is paralyzed. But we\r\ncan only work on, and trust in God.\"\r\n\r\nOur father's face of tragedy, the anguish in his voice, as he called us\r\ndown to hear the news, come vividly before us to-day, one of the\r\nclearest impressions of our youth. Our mother went with him next day to\r\nhear Governor Andrew's official announcement of the murder to the\r\nLegislature, and heard with deep emotion his quotation from\r\n\"Macbeth\":--\r\n\r\n                  \"Besides, this Duncan\r\n  Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\r\n  So clear in his great office, that his virtues\r\n  Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\r\n  The deep damnation of his taking-off,\" etc.\r\n\r\nWednesday, April 19, was:--\r\n\r\n\"The day of President Lincoln's funeral. A sad, disconnected day. I\r\ncould not work, but strolled around to see the houses, variously draped\r\nin black and white. Went to Bartol's church, not knowing of a service at\r\nour own. Bartol's remarks were tender and pathetic. I was pleased to\r\nhave heard them.\r\n\r\n\"Wrote some verses about the President--pretty good,\r\nperhaps,--scratching the last nearly in the dark, just before bedtime.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the poem called \"Parricide.\" It begins:--\r\n\r\n  O'er the warrior gauntlet grim\r\n  Late the silken glove we drew.\r\n  Bade the watch-fires slacken dim\r\n  In the dawn's auspicious hue.\r\n  Staid the armèd heel;\r\n  Still the clanging steel;\r\n  Joys unwonted thrilled the silence through.\r\n\r\nOn April 27 she \"heard of Wilkes Booth's death--shot on refusing to give\r\nhimself up--the best thing that could have happened to himself and his\r\nfamily\"; and wrote a second poem entitled \"Pardon,\" embodying her second\r\nand permanent thought on the subject:\r\n\r\n  Pains the sharp sentence the heart in whose wrath it was uttered,\r\n                    Now thou art cold;\r\n  Vengeance, the headlong, and Justice, with purpose close muttered,\r\n                    Loosen their hold, etc.\r\n\r\nBrief entries note the closing events of the war.\r\n\r\n\"_May 13._ Worked much on Essay.... In the evening said to Laura: 'Jeff\r\nDavis will be taken to-morrow.' Was so strongly impressed with the\r\nthought that I wanted to say it to Chev, but thought it was too silly.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 14._ The first thing I heard in the morning was the news of the\r\ncapture of Jeff Davis. This made me think of my preluding the night\r\nbefore....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther things beside essays demanded work in these days. The great\r\nstruggle was now over, and with it the long strain on heart and nerve,\r\nculminating in the tragic emotion of the past weeks. The inevitable\r\nreaction set in. Her whole nature cried out for play, and play meant\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"Working all day for the Girls' Party, to-morrow evening. Got only a\r\nvery short reading of Kant, and of Tyndall. Tea with the Bartols. Talk\r\nwith [E. P.] Whipple, who furiously attacked Tacitus. Bartol and I, who\r\nknow a good deal more about him, made a strong fight in his behalf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Working all day for the Party. The lists of men and women accepting and\r\ndeclining were balanced by my daughter F. with amusing anxiety.... The\r\ntwo sexes are now neck and neck. Dear little Maud was in high glee over\r\nevery male acceptance. Out of all this hubbub got a precious forty-five\r\nminutes with Kant....\"\r\n\r\nThe party proved \"very gay and pleasant.\"\r\n\r\nNow came a more important event: the Musical Festival celebrating the\r\nclose of the war, which was given by the Handel and Haydn Society, at\r\nits semi-centennial, in May, 1865. Our mother sang alto in the chorus.\r\nThe Journal records daily, sometimes semi-daily, rehearsals and\r\nperformances, Kant squeezed to the wall, and getting with difficulty his\r\ndaily hour or half-hour. Mendelssohn's \"Hymn of Praise\" and \"Elijah\";\r\nHaydn's \"Creation,\" Handel's \"Messiah\" and \"Israel in Egypt\"; she sang\r\nin them all.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample Festival day:--\r\n\r\n\"Attended morning rehearsal, afternoon concert, and sang in the evening.\r\nWe gave 'Israel in Egypt' and Mendelssohn's 'Hymn of Praise.' I got a\r\nshort reading of Kant, which helped me through the day. But so much\r\nmusic is more than human nerves can respond to with pleasure. This\r\nconfirms my belief in the limited power of our sensibilities in the\r\ndirection of pure enjoyment. The singing in the choruses fatigues me\r\nless than hearing so many things.\"\r\n\r\nAfter describing the glorious final performance of the \"Messiah,\" she\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n\"So farewell, delightful Festival! I little thought what a week of youth\r\nwas in store for me. For these things carried me back to my early years,\r\nand their passion for music. I remembered the wholeness with which I\r\nused to give myself up to the concerts and oratorios in New York, and\r\nthe intense reaction of melancholy which always followed these\r\noccasions.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the next day:--\r\n\r\n\"Still mourning the Festival a little. If I had kept up my music as I\r\nintended, in my early youth, I should never have done what I have\r\ndone--should never have studied philosophy, nor written what I have\r\nwritten. My life would have been more natural and passionate, but I\r\nthink less valuable. Yet I cannot but regret the privation of this\r\nelement in which I have lived for years. But I do believe that music is\r\nthe most expensive of the fine arts. It uses up the whole man more than\r\nthe other arts do, and builds him up less. It is more passional, less\r\nintellectual, than the other arts. Its mastery is simple and absolute,\r\nwhile that of the other arts is so complex as to involve a larger sphere\r\nof thought and reflection. I have observed the faces of this orchestra\r\njust disbanded. Their average is considerably above the ordinary one.\r\nBut they have probably more talent than thought.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 31 we find a significant entry. The evening before she had\r\nattended the Unitarian Convention, and \"heard much tolerable speaking,\r\nbut nothing of any special value or importance.\" She now writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I really suffered last evening from the crowd of things which I wished\r\nto say, and which, at one word of command, would have flashed into life\r\nand, I think, into eloquence. It is by a fine use of natural logic that\r\nthe Quaker denomination allows women to speak, under the pressure of\r\nreligious conviction. 'In Christ Jesus there is neither male nor\r\nfemale,' is a good sentence. Paul did not carry this out in his church\r\ndiscipline, yet, one sees, he felt it in his religious contemplation. I\r\nfeel that a woman's whole moral responsibility is lowered by the fact\r\nthat she must never obey a transcendent command of conscience. Man can\r\ngive her nothing to take the place of this. It is the _divine_ right of\r\nthe human soul.\"\r\n\r\nThe fatigue and excitement of the Festival had to be paid for: the\r\ninevitable reaction set in.\r\n\r\n\"_June 3._ Decidedly I have spleen in these days. Throughout my whole\r\nbody, I feel a mingled restlessness and feebleness, as if the nerves\r\nwere irritated, and the muscles powerless. I feel puzzled, too, about\r\nthe worth of what I have been doing for nearly three years past. There\r\nis no one to help me in these matters. I determine still to work on and\r\nhope on. Much of the work of every life is done in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"Spleen to-day, and utter discouragement. The wind is east, and\r\nthis gives me the strange feeling, described before, of restlessness and\r\npowerlessness. My literary affairs are in a very confused state. I have\r\nno market. This troubles me.... God keep me from falling away from my\r\npurpose, to do only what seems to me necessary and called for in my\r\nvocation, and not to produce for money, praise, or amusement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was melancholy and Godless all day, having taken my volume of Kant back\r\nto the Athenæum for the yearly rearrangement. Could not interest myself\r\nin anything.... Visited old Mrs. Sumner,[53] whose chariot and horses\r\nare nearly ready.\"\r\n\r\n  [53] The mother of Charles Sumner.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was some question of selling Lawton's Valley for\r\neconomic reasons. The exigency passed, but the following words show the\r\ndepth of her feeling on the subject: \"If I have any true philosophy, any\r\nsincere religion, these must support me under the privation of the\r\nValley. I feel this, and resolve to do well, but nature will suffer.\r\nThat place has been my confidante,--my bosom friend,--intimate to me as\r\nno human being ever will be--dear and comforting also to my\r\nchildren....\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 11...._ Thought of a good text for a sermon, 'In the world ye\r\nshall have tribulation,' the scope being to show that our tribulation,\r\nif we try to do well, is in the world, our refuge and comfort in the\r\nchurch. Thought of starting a society in Newport for the practice of\r\nsacred music, availing ourselves of the summer musicians and the\r\npossible aid of such ladies as Miss Reed, etc., for solos. Such an\r\nenterprise would be humanizing, and would supply a better object than\r\nthe empty reunions of fashion....\"\r\n\r\n\"_Wednesday, June 21._ Attended the meeting at Faneuil Hall, for the\r\nconsideration of reconstruction of the Southern States. Dana made a\r\nstatement to the effect that voting was a civic, not a natural, right,\r\nand built up the propriety of negro suffrage on the basis first of\r\nmilitary right, then of duty to the negro, this being the only mode of\r\nenabling him to protect himself against his late master. His treatment\r\nwas intended to be exhaustive, and was able, though cold and conceited.\r\nBeecher tumbled up on the platform immediately after, not having heard\r\nhim, knocked the whole question to pieces with his great democratic\r\npower, his humor, his passion, and his magnetism. It was Nature after\r\nArt, and his nature is much greater than Dana's art.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after this she writes: \"... Sumner in the evening--a long\r\nand pleasant visit. He is a very sweet-hearted man, and does not grow\r\nold.\"\r\n\r\nThe Musical Festival had not yet exacted full arrears of payment; she\r\nwas too weary even to enjoy the Valley at first; but after a few days of\r\nits beloved seclusion she shook off fatigue and was herself again,\r\nreading Kant and Livy, teaching the children, and gathering mussels on\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\nShe flits up to town to see the new statue of Horace Mann, \"in order to\r\ncriticise it for Chev's pamphlet\";[54] meets William Hunt, who praises\r\nits simplicity and parental character; and Charles Sumner, who tells her\r\nit looks better on a nearer view.\r\n\r\n  [54] Dr. Howe raised the money for this statue.\r\n\r\nThe day after--\"we abode in the Valley, when three detachments of\r\ncompany tumbled in upon us, to wit, Colonel Higginson and Mrs. McKay,\r\nthe Tweedys and John Field, and the Gulstons. All were friendly. Only on\r\nmy speaking of the rudeness occasionally shown me by a certain lady,\r\nMrs. Tweedy said: 'But that was in the presence of your superiors, was\r\nit not?' I replied: 'I do not know that I was ever in Mrs. X.'s company\r\nunder those circumstances!' After which we all laughed.\"\r\n\r\nShe was at this time sitting to Miss Margaret Foley for a portrait\r\nmedallion and was writing philosophy and poetry. Family and household\r\nmatters also claimed their share of attention.\r\n\r\n\"Finished reading over 'Polarity' [her essay]. Reading to the children,\r\n'Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man\r\nhath not where to lay his head'--my little Maud's eyes filled with\r\ntears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much worried by want of preparedness for today's picnic.

At the picnic I repeated my Cambridge poem, ...\r\nand read 'Amanda's Inventory' and my long poem on Lincoln's death....\r\nDuty depends on an objective, happiness upon a subjective, sense.

But Christ has given peace to the world,\r\npeace at least as an ideal object, to be ever sought, though never fully\r\nattained.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 10...._ Read Kant on state rights. According to him, wars of\r\nconquest are allowable only in a state of nature, not in a state of\r\npeace (which is not to be attained without a compact whose necessity is\r\nsupreme and whose obligations are sacred). So Napoleon's crusade against\r\nthe constituted authority of the European republic was without logical\r\njustification,--which accounts for the speedy downfall of his empire.\r\nWhat he accomplished had only the subjective justification of his genius\r\nand his ambition. His work was of great indirect use in sweeping away\r\ncertain barriers of usage and of superstition. He drew a picture of\r\ngovernment on a large scale and thus set a pattern which inevitably\r\nenlarged the procedures of his successors, who lost through him the\r\nprestige of divine right and of absolute power. But the inadequacy of\r\nhis object showed itself through the affluence of his genius. The\r\nuniversal dominion of the Napoleon family was not to be desired or\r\nendured by the civilized world at large.

It was well heard and received.\r\nAfterwards I read my poem called 'Philosophy,' and was urged to recite\r\nmy 'Battle Hymn,' which I did. I was much gratified by the kind\r\nreception I met with and the sight of many friends of my youth.

First, a new abode must be found for the winter, as the\r\nowners of 13 Chestnut Street claimed it for themselves. She and the\r\nDoctor added house-hunting to their other burdens, and found it a heavy\r\none. On October 6 she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Much excited about plans and prospects.

But the voice now tells me that I must bear it to the end, or\r\nlose it forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe move to Boylston Place was in November. Early in the month a\r\n\"frisking\" took place, with amusing results. Our mother went with\r\nGovernor and Mrs. Andrew and a gay party to Barnstable for the annual\r\nfestival and ball. The Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company acted as\r\nescort, and--according to custom--the band of the Company furnished the\r\nmusic. For some reason--the townspeople thought because the pretty girls\r\nwere all engaged beforehand for the dance--the officer in command\r\nstopped the music at twelve o'clock, to the great distress of the\r\nBarnstable people who had ordered their carriages at two or later. The\r\nparty broke up in disorder far from \"admired,\" and our mother\r\ncrystallized the general feeling in the following verses, which the\r\nBarnstableites promptly printed in a \"broadside,\" and sang to the then\r\npopular tune of \"Lanigan's Ball\":--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARNSTABLE BALL\r\n\r\nA LYRIC\r\n\r\n(_Appointed to be sung in all Social Meetings on the Cape_)\r\n\r\n  March away with your old artillery;\r\n    Don't come back till we give you a call.\r\n  Put your Colonel into the pillory;\r\n    He broke up the Barnstable Ball.\r\n\r\n  Country folks don't go a-pleasuring\r\n    Every day, as it doth befall;\r\n  They with deepest scorn are measuring\r\n    Him who broke up the Barnstable Ball.\r\n\r\n  He came down with his motley company,\r\n    Stalking round the 'cultural hall;\r\n  Couldn't find a partner to jump any,\r\n    So broke up the Barnstable Ball.\r\n\r\n  Warn't it enough with their smoking and thundering,\r\n    Sweeping about like leaves in a squall,\r\n  But they must take to theft and plundering,--\r\n    Steal the half of the Barnstable Ball?\r\n\r\n  Put the music into their pocket,\r\n    Order the figure-man not to bawl,\r\n  Twenty jigs were still on the docket,\r\n    When they adjourned the Barnstable Ball.\r\n\r\n  Gov'nor A. won't hang for homicide,\r\n    That's a point that bothers us all;\r\n  He must banish ever from his side\r\n    Such as murdered the Barnstable Ball.\r\n\r\n  When they're old and draw'd with rheumatiz,\r\n    Let them say to their grandbabes small,\r\n  \"Deary me, what a shadow of gloom it is\r\n    To remember the Barnstable Ball!\"\r\n\r\nThis autumn saw the preparation of a new volume of poems, \"Later\r\nLyrics.\" Years had passed since the appearance of \"Words for the Hour,\"\r\nand our mother had a great accumulation of poems, the arrangement of\r\nwhich proved a heavy task.\r\n\r\n\"The labor of looking over the manuscript nearly made me ill....

When I told them that I was, they seemed much pleased.\r\nThis I felt to be a great honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day again she is harassed with correcting proofs and furnishing\r\ncopy. \"Ran to Bartol for a little help, which he gave me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reverend C. A. Bartol was our next-door neighbor in Chestnut Street,\r\na most kind and friendly one. His venerable figure, wrapped in a wide\r\ncloak, walking always in the middle of the road (we never knew why he\r\neschewed the sidewalk), is one of the pleasant memories of Chestnut\r\nStreet. We were now to leave that beloved street; a sorrowful flitting\r\nit was.\r\n\r\n\"_Friday, November 3._ Moving all day. This is my last writing in this\r\ndear house, No. 13 Chestnut Street, where I have had three years of good\r\nwork, social and family enjoyment. Here I enjoyed my dear Sammy for six\r\nhappy months--here I mourned long and bitterly for him. Here I read my\r\nsix lectures on Practical Ethics.

Felt restored to something like the peace I enjoyed\r\nbefore these two tasks of printing and moving broke up all leisure and\r\nall study.

Another interest which came to her this\r\nautumn was that of singing with the Handel and Haydn Society. She and\r\nFlorence joined the altos, while \"Harry,\" then in college (Harvard,\r\n1869), sang bass. We find her also, in early December, rehearsing with a\r\nsmall chorus the Christmas music for the Church of the Disciples, and\r\nwriting and rehearsing a charade for the Club.\r\n\r\n\"_December 12._ Saw my new book at Tilton's.

Went out at 10 A.M. to take Foley to see [William] Hunt, whom we\r\nfound in his studio in a queer knitted coat. He showed an unfinished\r\nhead of General Grant, in which it struck me that the eyes looked like\r\nthe two scales of a balance in which men and events could be weighed.\"\r\n\r\n  [57] Sister of James Freeman Clarke.

He was the eldest, my Harry the youngest\r\nmember. I made a charade, _Shoddy_, in which Mary [Ward] and Flossy took\r\npart. Mary did very well. Flossy always does well. I enjoyed this family\r\ngathering more than anything since leaving home. It is so rare a\r\npleasure for me. Family occasions are useful in bringing people together\r\non the disinterested ground of natural affection, without any purpose of\r\nshow or self-advancement. Relations should meet on more substantial\r\nground than that of fashion and personal ambition. Nature and\r\nself-respect here have the predominance. In my youth I had no notion of\r\nthis, though I always clung to those of my own blood.\"\r\n\r\nFrom New York she went to Washington, where she gave a series of\r\nphilosophical readings. Here, while staying at the house of Mrs. Eames,\r\nshe had a violent attack of malarial fever, but struggled up again with\r\nher usual buoyancy.\r\n\r\n\"_February 19._ Weather rainy, so stayed at home; eyes weak, so could do\r\nlittle but lie in my easy-chair, avoid cold, and hang on to\r\nconversation. To-day the President[60] vetoed the bill for the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau. The reading of the veto was received by the Senate\r\nwith intense, though suppressed, excitement. Governor Andrew read it to\r\nus. It was specious, and ingeniously overstated the scope and powers\r\ndemanded for the Bureau, in order to make its withholdment appear a\r\nliberal and democratic measure. Montgomery Blair is supposed to have\r\nwritten this veto.\"\r\n\r\n  [59] The widow of her uncle, William G.

Governor Andrew\r\nbrought me in. Sam Hooper was there. I read 'The Fact Accomplished.'\r\nThey received it very well. I was well pleased with my reception.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day she was so weary that she fell asleep while the Marquis de\r\nChambrun was talking to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_February 23._ To-day we learned the particulars of President Johnson's\r\ndisgraceful speech, which awakens but one roar of indignation. To the\r\nSenate at 11.30. When the business hour is over, Fessenden moves the\r\nconsideration of the House Resolution proposing the delay in the\r\nadmission of members for the Southern States until the whole South shall\r\nbe in a state for readmission. Sherman, of Ohio, moves the postponement\r\nof the question, alleging the present excitement as a reason for this.\r\n(He probably does this in the Copperhead interest.) At this Fessenden\r\nshows his teeth and shakes the Ohio puppy pretty well. Howe of Wisconsin\r\nalso speaks for the immediate discussion of the question. Doolittle, of\r\n----, speaking against it, Trumbull calls him to order. Reverdy Johnson\r\npitches in a little. The Ayes and Noes are called for and the immediate\r\nconsideration receives a good majority. Fessenden now makes his speech,\r\nreads the passage from the President's speech, calling the committee of\r\nfifteen a directory,--comments fully on the powers of Congress, the\r\ninjustice of the President and his defiant attitude.... He has force as\r\ndebater, but no grasp of thought.... In the evening I read the first\r\nhalf of 'Limitations' to a very small circle. A Republican caucus took\r\nall the members of Congress. Garrison also lectured. I was sorry, but\r\ndid my best and said, 'God's will be done.' But I ought to have worked\r\nharder to get an audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 25...._ Rode with Lieber[61] as far as Baltimore. He heard\r\nHegel in his youth and thinks him, as I do, decidedly inferior to Kant,\r\nmorally as well as philosophically....\r\n\r\n  [61] Dr. Francis Lieber, the eminent German-American publicist.\r\n\r\n\"The laws and duties of society rest upon a supposed compact, but this\r\ncompact cannot deprive any set of men of rights and limit them to\r\nduties, for if you refuse them all rights, you deprive them even of the\r\npower to become a party to this compact, which rests upon their right to\r\ndo so. Our slaves had no rights. Women have few.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Washington, she spent several days with her sister Annie\r\nin Bordentown, and there and in New York gave readings which seem to\r\nhave been much more successful than those in Washington. After the New\r\nYork reading she is \"glad and thankful.\"\r\n\r\nThe visits in Bordentown were always a delight and refreshment to her.\r\nShe and her \"little Hitter\" frolicked, once more two girls together:\r\ne.g., the following incident:--\r\n\r\nThe Reverend ---- Bishop was the Mailliards' pastor; a kindly gentleman,\r\nwho could frolic as well as another. One day our Aunt Annie, wishing to\r\nask him to dine, sat down at her desk and wrote:--\r\n\r\n  \"My dear Mr. Bishop,\r\n  To-day we shall dish up\r\n  At one and a half\r\n  The hind leg of a calf--\"\r\n\r\nAt this point she was called away on household business. Our mother sat\r\ndown and wrote:--\r\n\r\n  \"Now B., if he's civil,\r\n  May join in our revel;\r\n  But if he is not,\r\n  He may go to the devil!\"\r\n\r\nDuring the days that followed, Kant and charades divided her time pretty\r\nevenly.\r\n\r\n\"Kant's 'Anthropologia' is rather trifling, after his great works. I\r\nread it to find out what Anthropology is.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Good is a direction; virtue is a habit.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Wearied by endless running about to find help for my charade, ----\r\nhaving disappointed me. Determine to undertake nothing more of the\r\nkind.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe charade (_Belabor_), which came off the following evening, was\r\nmarked by a comic \"To be or not to be,\" composed and recited by her in a\r\n\"Hamlet costume, consisting of a narrow, rather short black skirt, a\r\nlong black cloak and a black velvet toque, splendid lace ruff, amethyst\r\nnecklace. It was very effective, and the verses gave reasonable\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 15...._ Went to the Masonic Banquet, which was preceded by a\r\nlong ceremony, the consecration of three new banners. The forms were\r\ncurious, the music good, the occasion unique. The association appeared\r\nto me a pale ghost of knighthood, and the solemnities a compromise\r\nbetween high mass and dress parade. The institution now means nothing\r\nmore than a military and religious toy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this year she met with a serious loss in the death of her uncle, John\r\nWard. He had been a second father to her and her sisters; his kindly\r\nwelcome always made No. 8 Bond Street a family home.\r\n\r\n\"_April 4._ The contents of uncle's will are known to-day. He had made a\r\nnew one, changing the disposition of his property made in a previous\r\nwill which would have made my sisters and me much richer. This one gives\r\nequally to my cousins, Uncle William's four sons, and to us; largely to\r\nUncle Richard, and most kindly to Brother Sam and Wardie. We know not\r\nwhy this change was made, but once made, it must be acquiesced in, like\r\nother events past remedy. My cousins are wealthy already--this makes\r\nlittle difference to them, but much to us. God's will be done, however.\r\nI must remember my own doctrine, and build upon 'The Fact\r\nAccomplished.'\"\r\n\r\nThis passage explains the financial worries which, from now on, often\r\noppressed her. She was brought up in wealth and luxury; sober wealth,\r\nunostentatious luxury, but enough of both to make it needless for her\r\never to consider questions of ways and means. Her whole family, from\r\nthe adoring father down to the loving youngest sister, felt that she\r\nmust be shielded from every sordid care or anxiety; she was tended like\r\nan orchid, lest any rough wind check her perfect blossoming.\r\n\r\nHer father left a large fortune, much of which was invested in blocks of\r\nreal estate in what is now the heart of New York. Uncle John, best and\r\nkindest of men, had no knowledge of real estate and none of the\r\nforesight which characterized his elder brother. After Mr. Ward's death,\r\nhe made the mistake of selling out the Manhattan real estate, and\r\ninvesting the proceeds in stocks and bonds. Later, realizing his grave\r\nerror, he resolved to mitigate the loss to his three nieces by dividing\r\namong them the bulk of his property.\r\n\r\nThis failing, the disappointment could not but be a sensible one, even\r\nto the least money-loving of women. The Doctor's salary was never a\r\nlarge one: the children must be given every possible advantage of\r\neducation and society; no door that was open to her own youth should be\r\nclosed to them; again, to entertain their friends (albeit in simple\r\nfashion), to respond to every call of need or distress, was matter of\r\nnecessity to both our parents: small wonder that they were often pressed\r\nfor money. All through the Journals we find this note of financial\r\nanxiety: not for herself, but for her children, and later for her\r\ngrandchildren. She accepted the restricted means; she triumphed over\r\nthem, and taught us to hold such matters of little account compared with\r\nthe real things of life; but they never ceased to bewilder her.\r\n\r\nYet to-day, realizing of what vital importance this seeming misfortune\r\nwas to her; how but for this, her life and other lives might have lacked\r\n\"the rich flavor of hope and toil\"; how but for this she might have\r\nfailed to lock hands with humanity in a bond as close as it was\r\npermanent, who can seriously regret Uncle John's devastating yet\r\nfruitful mistake?\r\n\r\nIn April again she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Dull, sad and perplexed. My uncle not having made me a rich woman, I\r\nfeel more than ever impelled to make some great effort to realize the\r\nvalue of my mental capacities and acquisitions. I am as well entitled to\r\nan efficient literary position as any woman in this country--perhaps\r\nbetter than any other. Still I hang by the way, picking up ten dollars\r\nhere and there with great difficulty. I pray God to help me to an\r\noccasion or sphere in which I may do my utmost. I had as lief die as\r\nlive unless I can be satisfied that I have delivered the whole value of\r\nmy literary cargo--all at least that was invoiced for this world. Hear\r\nme, great Heaven! Guide and assist me. No mortal can.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day's entry is more cheerful.\r\n\r\n\"Feel better to-day. Made the acquaintance of Aldrich and Howells and\r\ntheir wives, at Alger's last evening. I enjoyed the evening more than\r\nusual. Aldrich has a very refined face. Howells[62] is odd-looking, but\r\nsympathetic and intelligent. Alger was in all his glory.\"\r\n\r\n  [62] Mr. Howells, in his _Literary Boston Thirty Years Ago_, thus speaks\r\n  of her (1895): \"I should not be just to a vivid phase if I failed to\r\n  speak of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and the impulse of reform which she\r\n  personified. I did not sympathize with this then so much as I do now,\r\n  but I could appreciate it on the intellectual side. Once, many years\r\n  later, I heard Mrs. Howe speak in public, and it seemed to me that she\r\n  made one of the best speeches I had ever heard. It gave me for the first\r\n  time a notion of what women might do in that sort if they entered public\r\n  life; but when we met in those earlier days I was interested in her as\r\n  perhaps our chief poetess. I believe she did not care to speak much of\r\n  literature; she was alert for other meanings in life, and I remember how\r\n  she once brought to book a youthful matron who had perhaps unduly\r\n  lamented the hardships of housekeeping, with the sharp demand, 'Child,\r\n  where is your _religion_?' After the many years of an acquaintance which\r\n  had not nearly so many meetings as years, it was pleasant to find her,\r\n  not long ago, as strenuous as ever for the faith or work, and as eager\r\n  to aid Stepniak as John Brown. In her beautiful old age she survives a\r\n  certain literary impulse of Boston, but a still higher impulse of Boston\r\n  she will not survive, for that will last while the city endures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_April 11...._ Between a man governed by inner and one governed by\r\nouter control, there is the difference which we find between a reptile\r\nin a shell and a vertebrate. The one has his vertebræ within to support\r\nhim, the other has them without to contain him.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 19._ Very busy all day. Ran about too much, and was very tired.\r\nHad friends, in the evening, to meet young Perabo. I did not wish to\r\ngive a party, on account of Uncle's death, but could not help getting\r\ntogether quite a lovely company of friends. Aldrich and wife were here,\r\nAlger, Bartol, Professor Youmans, Perabo, Dresel, Louisa D. Hunt, and\r\nothers. It was a good time.... Saw my last cent go--nothing now till\r\nMay, unless I can earn something.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 20._ Began to work over and correct my poem for the Church\r\nFestival, which must be licked into shape, for the Gods will give me\r\nnone other. So I must hammer at it slowly, and a good deal.... To write\r\npurely for money is to beg, first telling a story.\"\r\n\r\nIn these days the Doctor was very weary through excess of work. He\r\nlonged for a change, and would have been glad to receive the mission to\r\nGreece, of which some prospect had been held out to him. She writes:\r\n\"Chev full of the Greek mission, which I think he cannot get. I wish he\r\nmight, because he wishes it. Surely a man so modest and meritorious in\r\nhis public career might claim so small an acknowledgment as this. But as\r\nwe are, he represents Charity, I the study of Philosophy--we cannot be\r\nmore honored than by standing for these things.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thought that she might have some influence in obtaining the\r\nmission: accordingly she went to Washington, anxious to help if she\r\nmight. She saw the President of the Senate, who promised support. While\r\nthere she writes: \"Governor Andrew took me to General Grant's, where I\r\nsaw the General, with great satisfaction. Prayed at bedtime that I might\r\nnot become a superficial sham and humbug.\"\r\n\r\nHearing that Charles Sumner had sought her at the house of Mrs. Eames,\r\nshe sent a message to him by a common friend. She writes: \"Sumner cannot\r\nmake a visit at the hotel, but will see me at the Capitol. I know of\r\nnothing which exempts a man in public life from the duty of having, in\r\nprivate, some _human_ qualities.\" Mr. Sumner did come to see her later,\r\nwhen she was staying with Mrs. Eames. She saw Secretary Seward, who was\r\nvery ungracious to her; and President Johnson, whom she found \"not one\r\ninclined to much speech.\" Before the latter interview her prayer was:\r\n\"Let me be neither unskilful nor mean!\"\r\n\r\nThe visit to Mrs. Eames was a sad one, being at the time of the death of\r\nCount Gurowski, a singular man whom she has described in her\r\n\"Reminiscences\"; but she met many notable persons, and had much\r\ninteresting conversation with her host and hostess. She records one or\r\ntwo bits of talk.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Eames saying that Mrs. X. was an intelligent but not an original\r\nwoman, I said: 'She is not a silk-worm, but a silk-wearer!' Nine women\r\nout of ten would rather be the latter than the former.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Eames saying that he often talked because he could not make the\r\neffort to be silent, I said: 'Yes, sir; we know that the _vis inertiæ_\r\noften shows itself in motion.'\r\n\r\n\"I record these sayings,\" she adds, \"because they interested me, opening\r\nto myself little shades of thought not perceived before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_May 27._ Boston. My birthday. Forty-seven years old. J. F. C. preached\r\non 'The seed is the word,' and gave a significant statement of the\r\nseminal power of Christianity. They sang also a psalm tune which I like,\r\nso that the day (a rainy one) seems to me auspicious. I have little to\r\nshow for the past year's work, having produced no work of any length and\r\nread but little in public. The doctrine of the _seed_ does, however,\r\nencourage us to continue our small efforts. The most effectual\r\nquickening of society is through that small influence which creeps like\r\nthe leaven through the dough....\"\r\n\r\n\"... Roman piety was the duteous care of one's relatives. It follows\r\nfrom this that the disregard of parents and elders common in America is\r\nin itself an irreligious trait, and one which education should\r\nsedulously correct.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 29 she attended the Unitarian Festival. She recalls the fact that\r\nat the last festival she was \"tormented by the desire to speak. But I am\r\nnow grown more patient, knowing that silence also is valuable....\"\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier was not to receive the only reward he had ever sought for\r\nhis labors. On May 31 she writes: \"To-day the blow fell. A kind letter\r\nfrom Vice-President Foster informed me that Charles T. Tuckerman had\r\nbeen nominated for the Greek mission. This gave me an unhappy hour. Chev\r\nwas a good deal overcome by it for a time, but rallied and bears up\r\nbravely. The girls are rather glad. I am content, but I do not see what\r\ncan take the place of this cherished object to Chev....\"\r\n\r\nThe following verses embody her thoughts on this matter:--\r\n\r\n                   To S. G. H.\r\n\r\n_On his failure to receive the Grecian mission which he had been led to\r\nthink might be offered to him. 1866._\r\n\r\n  The Grecian olives vanish from thy sight,\r\n  The wondrous hills, the old historic soil;\r\n  The elastic air, that freshened with delight\r\n  Thy youthful temples, flushed with soldier toil.\r\n\r\n  O noble soul! thy laurel early wreathed\r\n  Gathers the Christian rose and lilies fair,\r\n  For civic virtues when the sword was sheathed,\r\n  And perfect faith that learns from every snare.\r\n\r\n  Let, then, the modern embassy float by,\r\n  Nor one regret in thy high bosom lurk:\r\n  God's mission called thy youth to that soft sky;\r\n  Wait God's dismissal where thou build'st His work!\r\n\r\n\"_Divide et impera_ is an old maxim of despotism which does not look as\r\nif States' rights pointed in the direction of true freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only in the natural order that the living dog is better than the\r\ndead lion. Will any one say that the living thief is better than the\r\ndead hero? No one, save perhaps the thief himself, who is no judge.\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal is now largely concerned with Kant, and with Maine's work on\r\n\"Ancient Law,\" from which she quotes freely. Here and there are touches\r\nof her own.\r\n\r\n\"Epicureans are to Stoics as circumference to centre.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Hegel more difficult than important. Many people suppose that\r\nthe difficulty of a study is a sure indication of its importance.\"\r\n\r\nIn these years the Doctor and our sister Julia were in summer time\r\nrather visitors than members of the family. The former was, as Governor\r\nBullock said of him, \"driving all the Charities of Massachusetts\r\nabreast,\" and could enjoy the Valley only by snatches, flying down for a\r\nday or a week as he could. Julia, from her early girlhood, had\r\ninterested herself deeply in all that concerned the blind, and had\r\nbecome more and more the Doctor's companion and workfellow at the\r\nPerkins Institution, where much of his time was necessarily spent. She\r\nhad classes in various branches of study, and in school and out gave\r\nherself freely to her blind pupils. A friend said to her mother, many\r\nyears later, \"It was one of the sights of Boston in the days of the\r\nHarvard Musical concerts to see your Julia's radiant face as she would\r\ncome into Music Hall, leading a blind pupil in either hand.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in this summer of 1866 Julia accompanied the Doctor on a visit to\r\nthe State Almshouse at Monson, and saw there a little orphan boy, some\r\nthree years old, who attracted her so strongly that she begged to be\r\nallowed to take him home with her. Accordingly she brought him to the\r\nValley, a sturdy, blue-eyed Irish lad. Julia, child of study and poetry,\r\nhad no nursery adaptability, and little \"Tukey\" was soon turned over to\r\nour mother, who gladly took charge of him. He was nearly of the age of\r\nher little Sammy: something in his countenance reminded her of the lost\r\nchild, and she found delight in playing with him. She would have been\r\nglad to adopt him, but this was not thought practicable. Julia had\r\nalready tired of him; the Doctor for many reasons advised against it.\r\n\r\nShe grieved all summer for the child; but was afterward made happy by\r\nhis adoption into a cheerful and prosperous home.\r\n\r\nThis was a summer of arduous work. The \"Tribune\" demanded more letters;\r\nKant and Maine could not be neglected, and soon Fichte was added to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the children must have every pleasure that she could give\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Worked hard all the morning for the croquet party in the afternoon,\r\nwhich was very pleasant and successful.\r\n\r\n\"Took Julia to the party on board the Rhode Island. She looked\r\ncharmingly, and danced. I was quite happy because she enjoyed it.\"\r\n\r\nEarly August found her in Northampton, reporting for the \"Tribune\" the\r\nConvention of the American Academy of Science. The Doctor and Julia\r\njoined her, and she had \"very busy days,\" attending the sessions and\r\nwriting her reports.\r\n\r\n\"Read over several times my crabbed essay on the 'Two Necessities,'\r\nwhich I determine to read in the evening. I have with me also the essay\r\non 'Limitations,' far more amusing and popular. But for a scientific\r\noccasion, I will choose a treatise which aims at least at a scientific\r\ntreatment of a great question. This essay asserts the distinctness of\r\nthe Ideal Order and its legitimate supremacy in human processes of\r\nthought. I make a great effort to get its points thoroughly in my mind.\r\nGo late to the Barnards'. The scientifics arrive very late, Agassiz gets\r\nthere at 9. I begin to read soon after. The ladies of our party are all\r\nthere. I feel a certain enthusiasm in my work and subject, but do not\r\ncommunicate it to the audience, which seemed fatigued and cold; all at\r\nleast but Pierce, Agassiz, and Davis. Had I done well or ill to read\r\nit?... Some soul may have carried away a seed-grain of thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 11...._ To Mount Holyoke in the afternoon. The ascent was\r\nfrightful, the view sublime. In the evening went to read to the insane\r\npeople at the asylum; had not 'Later Lyrics,' but 'Passion Flowers.'\r\nRead from this and recited from the other. Had great pleasure in doing\r\nthis, albeit under difficulties. Finished second 'Tribune' letter and\r\nsent it.\"\r\n\r\nBack at the Valley, she plunges once more into Fichte; long hours of\r\nstudy, varied by picnics and sailing parties.\r\n\r\n\"To church at St. Mary's. X. preached. The beginning of his sermon was\r\nliberal,--the latter half sentimental and sensational. 'The love of\r\nChrist constraineth us,' but he dwelt far too much on the supposition of\r\na personal and emotional relation between the soul and Christ. It is\r\nChristian doctrine interpreted by human sympathy that reclaims us.\r\nChrist lives in his doctrine, influences us through that, and his\r\nhistorical personality. All else is myth and miracle. What Christ is\r\nto-day ideally we may be able to state, of what he is really, Mr. X.\r\nknows no more than I do, and I know nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Stayed to Communion, which was partly pleasant. But the Episcopal\r\nCommunion struck me as dismal, compared to our own. It is too literal\r\nand cannibalistic;--the symbolism of the eating and drinking is too\r\nlittle made out. Our Unitarian Communion is a feast of joy. The\r\nblessedness of Christ's accomplishment swallows up the sorrow of his\r\nsacrifice. We have been commemorating the greatest act and fact of human\r\nhistory, the initiation of the gentler morals of the purer faith. We are\r\nglad,--not trivially, but solemnly, and our dear Master is glad with us,\r\nbut not as if he aimed a direct personal influence at each one of us.\r\nThis is too human and small a mode of operation.\r\n\r\n\"He is there for us as the sun is there and the brightness of his deed\r\nand doctrine penetrates the recesses of our mind and consciousness. But\r\nthat he knows each one of us cannot and need not be affirmed.\r\n\r\n        'The moon looks\r\n        On many brooks:\r\n  The brook can see no moon but this.'\r\n\r\nSo that we see him, it matters not whether he sees us or no.\r\n\r\n\"Spinoza's great word;--if we love God, we shall not trouble ourselves\r\nabout his loving us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I yesterday spoke to Joseph Coggeshall, offering to give a reading at\r\nthe schoolhouse, in order to start a library fund. He appeared pleased\r\nwith the idea. I proposed to ask .50 for each ticket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chev suggests Europe. '_Je suis content du palazzo Pitti._'\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot study Fichte for more than forty-five minutes at a time.\r\nReading him is not so bad as translating, which utterly overpowers my\r\nbrain, although I find it useful in comprehending him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I begin to doubt the availability of Fichte's methods for me. I become\r\neach day more dispirited over him. With the purest intention he is much\r\nless of an ethicist than Kant. These endless refinements in _rationale_\r\nof the _ego_ confuse rather than enlighten the moral sense. Where the\r\nstudy of metaphysics becomes de-energizing, it becomes demoralizing.\r\nSubtlety used in a certain way unravels confusion, in a certain other\r\nway produces it. Kant unwinds the silkworm's web, but Fichte tangles the\r\nskein of silk,--at least so it seems to me.\r\n\r\n\"Spent most of the afternoon in preparing for a tea party, cutting\r\npeaches and preparing bread and butter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read 11th and 12th chapters of Mark in the Valley. At some moments one\r\ngets a clearer and nearer perception of the thought and personality of\r\nChrist than that which we commonly carry with us.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in October came the move \"home to Boylston Place, leaving the\r\nValley with great regret, but feeling more the importance of being with\r\nthe children, as I draw nearer to them.\"\r\n\r\nOur mother had remained after the rest of us, to close the house. In\r\nBoston she had the great pleasure of welcoming to this country her\r\nnephew, Francis Marion Crawford, then a boy of twelve years. Born and\r\nbred in Rome, a beautiful and petted child, he was now to learn to be an\r\nAmerican schoolboy. She took him herself to St. Paul's School in\r\nConcord, New Hampshire; and for a year or two he spent most of his\r\nholidays with us, to the delight of us all.\r\n\r\nIn this autumn of 1866 she undertook a new task, of which the first\r\nmention in the Journal reads: \"I will here put the names of some writers\r\nof stories whom I may employ for the magazine.\"\r\n\r\nA list of writers follows: and the next day she writes: \"I saw J. R.\r\nGilmour and agreed with him to do editorial service for thirty dollars\r\nper week for three months.\"\r\n\r\nThis magazine was the \"Northern Lights.\" The first number appeared in\r\nJanuary, 1867. It contained two articles by Mrs. Howe: the \"Salutation\"\r\nand a thoughtful poem called \"The Two R's\" (Rachel and Ristori). Later,\r\nwe find her in the \"Sittings of the Owl Club,\" making game of the\r\nstudies she loved.\r\n\r\n         This owl went to Germany,\r\n          This owl stayed at home;\r\n        This owl read Kant and Fichte,\r\n            This owl read none.\r\n  This owl said \"To-whit! I can't understand\r\n           the dogmatic categorical!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Northern Lights\" gleam fitfully in the Journal.\r\n\r\n\"_October 26._ To write Henry James for story, Charles T. Brooks for\r\nsketches of travel. Saw and talked with Gilmour, who confuses my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 29._ Chev went with me to Ristori's _début_, which was in\r\nMedea.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 3._ All of these days have been busy and interrupted.\r\nMaggi[63] has been reading Ristori's plays in my parlor every day this\r\nweek and my presence has been compulsory. I have kept on with Fichte\r\nwhose '_Sittenlehre_' I have nearly finished. Have copied one or two\r\npoems, written various letters in behalf of the magazine, have seen\r\nRistori thrice on the stage and once in private.\"\r\n\r\n  [63] Count Alberto Maggi, an Italian _littérateur_.\r\n\r\n\"_November 10._ Finished copying and correcting my editorial for the\r\nfirst number of my weekly. Finished also Fichte's '_Sittenlehre_' for\r\nwhose delightful reading I thank God, praying never to act quite\r\nunworthily of its maxims.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 11._ Called on Mrs. Charles Sumner, and saw both parties, who\r\nwere very cordial and seemed very happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 15._ Crackers, .25, eggs, .43, rosewater for Frank Crawford,\r\n.48. Very weary and overdone. The twelve apostles shall judge the\r\ntwelve tribes in that the Christian doctrine judges the Jews.\r\n\r\n\"I lead a weary life of hurry and interruption.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 18._ Weary hearts must, I think, be idle hearts, for it is\r\ncheery even to be overworked. My studies and experience have combined to\r\nshow me the difficulty of moral attainment, but both have made me feel\r\nthat with every average human being there is a certain possible\r\nconjunction of conviction, affection, and personality which, being\r\neffected, the individual will see the reality of the ethical aspects of\r\nlife and the necessary following of happiness upon a good will and its\r\nstrenuous prosecution.\r\n\r\n\"I began Fichte's '_Wissenschaftslehre_' two or three days ago.\r\n\r\n\"Gave a small party to Baron Osten Sacken.... Peaceably if we can,\r\nforcibly if we must, makes the difference between the beggar and the\r\nthief.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 26._ Very unwell; a good day's work, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 27._ Better. Last week was too fatiguing for a woman of my\r\nage. I cannot remember my forty-seven years, and run about too much. The\r\noratorio should, I fear, be given up.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 8._ I came in from Lexington last night after the reading[64]\r\nin an open buggy with a strange driver, a boy of eighteen, who when we\r\nwere well under way showed me a pistol,--a revolver, I think,--and said\r\nthat he never travelled at night without one. As the boy's very face was\r\nunknown to me, the whole adventure seemed bizarre. He brought me home\r\nto my own house.... Am writing on 'Representation.'... Man asks nothing\r\nso much as to be helped to self-control.\"\r\n\r\n  [64] At the Lexington Lyceum for the Monument Fund.\r\n\r\n\"_December 9._ Heard J. F. C. as usual. 'She hath done what she\r\ncould'--a good text for me at this moment. Independently of ambition,\r\nvanity, pride,--all of which prompt all of us, I feel that I must do\r\nwhat my hand finds to do, taking my dictation and my reward from sources\r\nquite above human will and approbation.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 19...._ Vicomte de Chabreuil came. We had a long, and to me\r\nsplendid, conversation. Were I young this person would occupy my\r\nthoughts somewhat. Very intelligent, simple, and perfectly bred, also a\r\n_rosso_,--a rare feature in a Frenchman.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 27._ Let me live until to-morrow, and not be ridiculous! I\r\nhave a dinner party and an evening party to-day and night, and knowing\r\nmyself to be a fool for my pains, am fain to desire that others may not\r\nfind it out and reproach me as they discover it.\r\n\r\n\"Got hold of Fichte a little which rested my weary brain.\r\n\r\n\"My party proved very pleasant and friendly.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 29...._ I read last night at the Club a poem, 'The Rich Man's\r\nLibrary,' which contrasts material and mental wealth, much to the\r\ndisparagement of the former. I felt as if I ought to read it, having\r\ninwardly resolved never again to disregard that inner prompting which\r\nleaves us no doubt as to the authority of certain acts which present\r\nthemselves to us for accomplishment. Having read the poem, however, I\r\nfelt doubtful whether after all I had done well to read it in that\r\ncompany. I will hope, however, that it may prove not to have been\r\nutterly useless. The imperfection of that which we try to do well\r\nsometimes reacts severely upon us and discourages us from further\r\neffort. It should not.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 31._ Ran about all day, but studied and wrote also.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, old Diary, farewell, old Year! Good, happy and auspicious to\r\nme and mine, and to mankind, I prayed that you might be, and such I\r\nthink you have been. To me you have brought valued experience and\r\nrenewed study. You have introduced me to Fichte, you have given me the\r\nhonor of a new responsibility, you have made me acquainted with some\r\nexcellent personages, among them Baron McKaye, a youth of high and noble\r\nnature; Perabo, an artist of real genius.... You have taught me new\r\nlessons of the true meaning and discipline of life,--the which should\r\nmake me more patient in all endurance, more strenuous in all endeavor.\r\nYou have shown me more clearly the line of demarcation between different\r\ntalents, pursuits, and characters. So I thank and bless your good days,\r\nlooking to the Supreme from whom we receive all things. The most\r\nnoticeable events of the year just passed, so far as I am concerned, are\r\nthe following: the invitation received by me to read at the Century Club\r\nin New York. This reading was hindered by the death of my\r\nbrother-in-law, J. N. Howe. The death of dear Uncle John. My journey to\r\nWashington to get Chev the Greek appointment. Gurowski's death.\r\nAttendance at the American Academy of Science at Northampton in August.\r\nThe editorship of the new weekly. My study of Fichte's '_Sittenlehre_'\r\nand the appearance of my essay on the 'Ideal State' in the 'Christian\r\nExaminer.' My reading at Lexington for the Monument Association. My\r\nbeing appointed a delegate from the Indiana Place Church to the Boston\r\nConference of Unitarian and other Christian Churches. My readings at\r\nNorthampton, Washington, and elsewhere are all set down in their place.\r\nThe bitter opposition of my family renders this service a very difficult\r\nand painful one for me. I do not, therefore, seek occasions of\r\nperforming it, not being quite clear as to the extent to which they\r\nought to limit my efficiency; but when the word and the time come\r\ntogether I always try to give the one to the other and always shall. God\r\ninstruct whichever of us is in the wrong about this. And may God keep\r\nmean and personal passions far removed from me in the coming years. The\r\nteaching of life has of late done much to wean me from them, but the\r\ntrue human requires culture and the false human suppression every day of\r\nour lives and as long as we live.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nGREECE AND OTHER LANDS\r\n\r\n1867; _aet._ 48\r\n\r\nOUR COUNTRY\r\n\r\n  On primal rocks she wrote her name,\r\n  Her towers were reared on holy graves;\r\n  The golden seed that bore her came\r\n  Swift-winged with prayer o'er ocean waves.\r\n\r\n  The Forest bowed his solemn crest,\r\n  And open flung his sylvan doors;\r\n  Meek Rivers led the appointed Guest\r\n  To clasp the wide-embracing shores;\r\n\r\n  Till, fold by fold, the broidered Land\r\n  To swell her virgin vestments grew,\r\n  While Sages, strong in heart and hand,\r\n  Her virtue's fiery girdle drew.\r\n\r\n  O Exile of the wrath of Kings!\r\n  O Pilgrim Ark of Liberty!\r\n  The refuge of divinest things,\r\n  Their record must abide in thee.\r\n\r\n  First in the glories of thy front\r\n  Let the crown jewel Truth be found;\r\n  Thy right hand fling with generous wont\r\n  Love's happy chain to farthest bound.\r\n\r\n  Let Justice with the faultless scales\r\n  Hold fast the worship of thy sons,\r\n  Thy commerce spread her shining sails\r\n  Where no dark tide of rapine runs.\r\n\r\n  So link thy ways to those of God,\r\n  So follow firm the heavenly laws,\r\n  That stars may greet thee, warrior-browed,\r\n  And storm-sped angels hail thy cause.\r\n\r\n  O Land, the measure of our prayers,\r\n  Hope of the world, in grief and wrong!\r\n  Be thine the blessing of the years,\r\n  The gift of faith, the crown of song.\r\n\r\n                                        J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January, 1867, a new note is sounded.\r\n\r\n\"In the evening attended meeting in behalf of Crete, at which Chev\r\npresided and spoke. Excellent as to matter, but always with a defective\r\nelocution, not sending his voice out. He was much and deservedly\r\nglorified by other speakers, and, indeed, his appearance on this\r\noccasion was most touching and interesting. Phillips was very fine;\r\nHuntington was careful, polished, and interesting. Andrew read the\r\nresolutions, with a splendid compliment to Chev.\"\r\n\r\nSome months before this, in August, 1866, the Cretans had risen against\r\ntheir Turkish oppressors, and made a valiant struggle for freedom. From\r\nthe first the Doctor had been deeply interested in the insurrection:\r\nnow, as reports came of the sufferings of the brave mountaineers, and of\r\ntheir women and children, who had been sent to the mainland for safety,\r\nhe felt impelled to help them as he had helped their fathers forty years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHe was sixty-six years old, but looked much younger. When, at the first\r\nmeeting called by him, he rose and said, \"Forty-five years ago I was\r\nmuch interested in the Greek Revolution,\" the audience was amazed. His\r\nhair was but lightly touched with silver; his eyes were as bright, his\r\nfigure as erect and martial, as when, in 1826, he had fought and marched\r\nunder the Greek banner, and slept under the Greek stars, wrapped in his\r\nshaggy capote.\r\n\r\nHis appeal in behalf of Crete roused the ever-generous heart of Boston.\r\nCommittees were formed, and other meetings were held, among them that\r\njust described. Governor Andrew's \"splendid compliment\" to him was given\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"I venture, Mr. Chairman, to make one single suggestion--that if all of\r\nus were dumb to-night, if the eloquent voices which have stimulated our\r\nblood and inspired our hearts had been silent as the tomb, your\r\npresence, sir, would have been more eloquent than a thousand orations;\r\nwhen we remember that after the life-time of a whole generation of men,\r\nhe who forty years ago bared his arm to seize the Suliote blade, speaks\r\nagain with the voice of his age in defence of the cause of his youth.\"\r\n\r\nThirty-seven thousand dollars were raised for Crete, and in March, 1867,\r\nDr. Howe sailed again for Greece on an errand of mercy. The Journal\r\ngives an outline of the busy winter:--\r\n\r\n\"The post is the poor man's valet....\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 12._ A busy and studious day; had the neighbors in after tea.\r\nWant clamors for relief, but calls for cure, which begins in\r\ndiscipline....\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 24._ N. P. Willis's funeral. Chev came home quite suddenly and\r\nasked me to go with him to the church, St. Paul's. The pallbearers were\r\nLongfellow and Lowell, Drs. Holmes and Howe, Whipple and Fields, T. B.\r\nAldrich and I don't know who. Coffin covered with flowers. Appearance of\r\nthe family interesting: the widow bowed and closely shrouded. Thus ends\r\na man of perhaps first-rate genius, ruined by the adoption of an utterly\r\nfrivolous standard of labor and of life. George IV and Bulwer have to\r\nanswer for some of these failures.\r\n\r\n\"My tea party was delightful, friendly, not fashionable. We had a good\r\ntalk, and a lovely, familiar time.\r\n\r\n\"Heard J. F. C. Took my dear Francesco [Marion Crawford] at his request,\r\nwith great pleasure, feeling that he would find there a living Jesus\r\nimmortal in influence, instead of the perfumed and embalmed mummy of\r\northodoxy....\r\n\r\n\"Of that which is not clear one cannot have a clear idea. My reading in\r\nFichte to-day is of the most confused.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 7._ Chev came dancing in to tell me that Flossy is engaged to\r\nDavid Hall. His delight knew no bounds. I am also pleased, for David is\r\nof excellent character and excellent blood, the Halls being first-rate\r\npeople and with no family infirmity (insanity or blindness). My only\r\nregret is that it must prove a long engagement, David being a very young\r\nlawyer.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 14._ All's up, as I feared, with 'Northern Lights' in its\r\npresent form. Gilmour proposes to go to New York and to change its form\r\nand character to that of a weekly newspaper. I of course retire from it\r\nand, indeed, despite my title of editor, have been only a reader of\r\nmanuscripts and contributor--nothing more. I have not had power of any\r\nsort to make engagements.\"\r\n\r\nThe tenth number of \"Northern Lights\" was also the last, and we hear no\r\nmore of the ill-fated magazine.\r\n\r\nThe Journal says nothing of the proposed trip to Greece, until February\r\n15:--\r\n\r\n\"I had rather die, it seems to me, than decide wrongly about going to\r\nEurope and leaving the children. And yet I am almost sure I shall do so.\r\nChev clearly wishes me to go.... Whether I go or stay, God help me to\r\nmake the best of it. My desire to help Julia is a strong point in favor\r\nof the journey. It would be, I think, a turning-point for her.\"\r\n\r\nLater she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Chev has taken our passage in the Asia, which sails on the 13th\r\nproximo. So we have the note of preparation, and the prospect of change\r\nand separation makes us feel how happy we have been, in passing this\r\nwhole winter together.\"\r\n\r\nThe remaining days were full of work of every kind. She gave readings\r\nhere and there in aid of the Cretans.\r\n\r\n\"Ran about much: saw Miss Rogers's deaf pupils at Mrs. Lamson's, very\r\ninteresting.... For the first time in three days got a peep at Fichte.\r\nFinished Jesse's 'George the Third.'\r\n\r\n\"Went to Roxbury to read at Mrs. Harrington's for the benefit of the\r\nCretans. It was a literary and musical entertainment. Tickets, one\r\ndollar. We made one hundred dollars. My poems were very kindly received.\r\nAfterwards, in great haste, to Sophia Whitwell's,[65] where I received a\r\ngreat ovation, all members greeting me most affectionately. Presently\r\nMr. [Josiah] Quincy, with some very pleasant and complimentary remarks\r\non Dr. Howe and myself, introduced Mrs. Silsbee's farewell verses to me,\r\nwhich were cordial and feeling. Afterwards I read my valedictory verses,\r\nstrung together in a very headlong fashion, but just as well liked as\r\nthough I had bestowed more care upon them. A bouquet of flowers crowned\r\nthe whole, really a very gratifying occasion.\"\r\n\r\n  [65] This was evidently a meeting of the \"Brain Club.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 13._ Departure auspicious. Dear Maud, Harry, and Flossy on board\r\nto say farewell, with J. S. Dwight, H. P. Warner, and other near\r\nfriends. Many flowers; the best first day at sea I ever passed.\"\r\n\r\nJulia and Laura were the happy two chosen to join this expedition, the\r\nother children staying with relatives and friends. From first to last\r\nthe journey was one of deepest interest. The Journal keeps a faithful\r\nrecord of sight-seeing, which afterward took shape in a volume, \"From\r\nthe Oak to the Olive,\" published in 1868, and dedicated \"To S. G. H.,\r\nthe strenuous champion of Greek liberty and of human rights.\"\r\n\r\nIt is written in the light vein of \"A Trip to Cuba.\" In the first\r\nchapter she says: \"The less we know about a thing, the easier it is to\r\nwrite about it. To give quite an assured and fluent account of a\r\ncountry, we should lose no time on our first arrival. The first\r\nimpression is the strongest. Familiarity constantly wears off the edge\r\nof observation. The face of the new country astonishes us once, and once\r\nonly.\"\r\n\r\nThough much that she saw during this trip was already familiar to her,\r\nthere is no lack of strength in the impression. She sees things with new\r\neyes; the presence of \"the neophytes,\" as she calls the daughters, gives\r\nan atmosphere of \"first sight\" to the whole.\r\n\r\nIn London she finds \"the old delightful account reopened, the friendly\r\nvisits frequent, and the luxurious invitations to dinner occupy every\r\nevening of our short week.\"\r\n\r\n\"_London._ Lunch with the Benzons, whose palatial residence moved me\r\nnot to envy. This seems an idle word, but I like to record my\r\nsatisfaction in a simple, unencumbered life, without state of any kind,\r\nsave my pleasant relations and my good position in my own country. Mrs.\r\nBenzon asked me to come alone to dinner in the evening. First, however,\r\nI called upon Arthur Mills at Hyde Park Gardens; then upon Mrs.\r\nAmbassadress Adams, who was quite cordial; then in frantic hurry home to\r\ndress. At Benzon's I met Robert Browning, a dear and sacred personage,\r\ndear for his own and his wife's sake. He sat next me at table and by and\r\nby spoke very kindly of my foolish verses[66] about himself and E. B. B.\r\nI mean he spoke of them with magnanimity. Of course my _present_ self\r\nwould not publish, nor I hope write, anything of the kind, but I\r\nlaunched the arrow in the easy petulance of those days, more occupied\r\nwith its force and polish than with its direction.\"\r\n\r\n  [66] \"Kenyon's Legacy,\" printed in _Later Lyrics_.\r\n\r\n\"To Lady Stanley's 5 o'clock tea, where I met her daughter Lady Amberley\r\nand Sir Samuel Baker, the explorer of the sources of the Nile. Dined\r\nwith the Benzons, meeting Browning again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea with Miss Cobbe. Met the Lyells. Dined with Males family, Greek,--a\r\nmost friendly occasion. Afterwards went for a short time to Mrs. ----, a\r\nvery wealthy Greek widow, who received us very ill. Heard there Mr. Ap\r\nThomas, a Welsh harper who plays exceedingly well. The pleasure of\r\nhearing him scarcely compensated for Mrs. ----'s want of politeness,\r\nwhich was probably not intentional. Saw there Sir Samuel and Lady\r\nBaker, the latter wore an amber satin tunic over a white dress, and a\r\nnecklace of lion's teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 5._ Breakfast with Mr. Charles Dalrymple at 2 Clarges Street,\r\nwhere we met Mr. Grant Duff, Baron McKaye, and others. Tea at Lady\r\nTrevelyan's, where I was introduced to Dean Stanley of Westminster ...\r\nand young Milman, son of the Reverend H. M. Lady Stanley was Lady\r\nAugusta Bruce, a great favorite of the Queen. Dined at Argyll Lodge,\r\nfound the Duchess serene and friendly; the Duke seemed hard and\r\nsensible, Lord Lorne, the eldest son, very pleasant, and Hon. Charles\r\nHoward and son most amiable, with more breeding, I should say, than the\r\nDuke. Chev was the hero of this occasion; the Duchess always liked him.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this brief week, the Doctor had been in close communication with\r\nthe Greeks of London, who one and all were eager to welcome him, and to\r\nbid him Godspeed on his errand. His business transacted, he felt that he\r\nmust hurry on toward Greece. Some stay must be made in Rome, where our\r\nAunt Louisa (now Mrs. Luther Terry) was anxiously expecting the party;\r\nbut even this tie of affection and friendship could not keep the Doctor\r\nlong from his quest. On May 1 he and Julia went to Greece, the others\r\nremaining for some weeks in Italy.\r\n\r\nSixteen years had passed since our mother's last visit to Rome. She\r\nfound some changes in the city, but more vital ones in herself.\r\n\r\n\"I left Rome,\" she says, \"after those days, with entire determination,\r\nbut with infinite reluctance. America seemed the place of exile, Rome\r\nthe home of sympathy and comfort.... And now I must confess that, after\r\nso many intense and vivid pages of life, this visit to Rome, once a\r\ntheme of fervent and solemn desire, becomes a mere page of embellishment\r\nin a serious and instructive volume.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows a disquisition on \"the Roman problem for the American\r\nthinker\"; the last passage gives her conclusion:--\r\n\r\n\"A word to my countrymen and countrywomen, who, lingering on the edge of\r\nthe vase, are lured by its sweets, and fall into its imprisonment. It is\r\na false, false superiority to which you are striving to join yourself. A\r\nprince of puppets is not a prince, but a puppet; a superfluous duke is\r\nno dux; a titular count does not count. Dresses, jewels, and equipages\r\nof tasteless extravagance; the sickly smile of disdain for simple\r\npeople; the clinging together, by turns eager and haughty, of a clique\r\nthat becomes daily smaller in intention, and whose true decline consists\r\nin its numerical increase--do not dream that these lift you in any true\r\nway--in any true sense. For Italians to believe that it does, is\r\nnatural; for Englishmen to believe it, is discreditable; for Americans,\r\ndisgraceful.\"\r\n\r\nThe Terrys were at this time living in Palazzo Odescalchi. Our mother\r\nobserves that \"the whole of my modest house in Boylston Place would\r\neasily, as to solid contents, lodge in the largest of those lofty rooms.\r\nThe Place itself would equally lodge in the palace. I regard my re-found\r\nfriends with wonder, and expect to see them execute some large and\r\nstately manoeuvre, indicating their possession of all this space.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Holy Week when they arrived in Rome, and she was anxious that the\r\n\"neophytes\" should see as much as possible of its impressive ceremonies.\r\nShe took them to St. Peter's to see the washing of the pilgrims' feet by\r\nnoble Roman ladies, and to hear the \"Miserere\" in the Sistine Chapel.\r\nThese functions are briefly chronicled in the Journal and more fully in\r\n\"From the Oak to the Olive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Solid fact as the performance of the _functions_ remains, for us it\r\nassumes a forcible unreality, through the impeding intervention of black\r\ndresses and veils, with what should be women under them. But as these\r\ncreatures push like battering-rams, and caper like he-goats, we shall\r\nprefer to adjourn the question of their humanity, and to give it the\r\nbenefit of a doubt. We must except, however, our countrywomen from dear\r\nBoston, who were not seen otherwise than decently and in order.\"\r\n\r\nA vivid description follows of the ceremonies of Good Friday and Easter\r\nSunday, ending with the illumination of St. Peter's.\r\n\r\n\"A magical and unique spectacle it certainly is, with the well-known\r\nchange from the paper lanterns to the flaring _lampions_. Costly is it\r\nof human labor, and perilous to human life. And when I remembered that\r\nthose employed in it receive the sacrament beforehand, in order that\r\nimminent death may not find them out of a state of grace, I thought that\r\nits beauty did not so much signify.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Journal she writes, April 19: \"It is the golden calf of old which\r\nhas developed into the papal bull.\"\r\n\r\nAt a concert she saw the Abbé Liszt, \"whose vanity and desire to attract\r\nattention were most apparent.\"\r\n\r\nThough the sober light of middle age showed Rome less magical than of\r\nold, yet the days were full of delight.\r\n\r\n\"In these scarce three weeks,\" she cries, \"how much have we seen, how\r\nlittle recorded and described! So sweet has been the fable, that the\r\nintended moral has passed like an act in a dream--a thing of illusion\r\nand intention, not of fact. Impotent am I, indeed, to describe the\r\nriches of this Roman world,--its treasures, its pleasures, its\r\nflatteries, its lessons. Of so much that one receives, one can give\r\nagain but the smallest shred,--a leaf of each flower, a scrap of each\r\ngarment, a proverb for a sermon, a stave for a song. So be it; so,\r\nperhaps, it is best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last Sunday I attended a Tombola at Piazza Navona.... I know the Piazza\r\nof old. Sixteen years since I made many a pilgrimage thither, in search\r\nof Roman trash. I was not then past the poor amusement of spending money\r\nfor the sake of spending it. The foolish things I brought home moved the\r\nlaughter of my little Roman public. I appeared in public with some\r\nforlorn brooch or dilapidated earring; the giddy laughed outright, and\r\nthe polite gazed quietly. My rooms were the refuge of all broken-down\r\nvases and halting candelabra. I lived on the third floor of a modest\r\nlodging, and all the wrecks of art that neither first, second, nor\r\nfourth would buy, found their way into my parlor, and stayed there at my\r\nexpense. I recall some of these adornments to-day. Two heroes, in\r\npainted wood, stood in my dark little entry. A gouty Cupid in bas-relief\r\nencumbered my mantelpiece. Two forlorn figures in black and white glass\r\nrecalled the auction whose unlucky prize they had been. And Horace\r\nWallace, coming to talk of art and poetry, on my red sofa, sometimes\r\nsaluted me with a paroxysm of merriment, provoked by the sight of my\r\nlast purchase. Those days are not now. Of their accumulations I retain\r\nbut a fragment or two. Of their delights remain a tender memory, a\r\nchildish wonder at my own childishness. To-day, in heathen Rome, I can\r\nfind better amusement than those shards and rags were ever able to\r\nrepresent.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 26 she writes in her Journal:--\r\n\r\n\"I remembered the confusion of my mind when I was here sixteen years ago\r\nand recognized how far more than equivalent for the vivacity of youth,\r\nnow gone, is the gain of a steadfast standard of good and happiness. To\r\ndesire supremely ends which are incompatible with no one's happiness and\r\nwhich promote the good of all--this even as an ideal is a great gain\r\nfrom the small and eager covetousness of personal desires. Religion\r\ngives this steadfast standard whose pursuit is happiness. Therefore let\r\nhim who seeks religion be glad that he seeks the only true good of\r\nwhich, indeed, we constantly fail, and yet in seeking it are constantly\r\nrenewed.... Studios of Mozier and of Rogers--the former quite full. Both\r\nhave considerable skill, neither has genius. The statues of Miss Hosmer\r\nare marble silences--they have nothing to say.\"\r\n\r\nGreece was before her. On June 17 the Journal says:--\r\n\r\n\"Acroceraunian mountains, shore of Albania. Nothing strikes me--I have\r\nbeen struck till I am stricken down. _Sirocco_ and head wind--vessel\r\nlaboring with the sea, I with Guizot's 'Meditations,' which also have\r\nsome head wind in them. They seem to me inconclusive in statement and\r\ncommonplace in thought, yet presenting some facts of interest. A little\r\nbefore 2 P.M. we passed Fano, the island on which Calypso could not\r\nconsole herself, and no wonder. At 2 we enter the channel of Corfù.\"\r\n\r\nAt Corfù a Turkish pacha came on board with his harem, to our lively\r\ninterest. The Journal gives every observable detail of the somewhat\r\nsqualid _ménage_, from the pacha's lilac trousers down to the dress of\r\nhis son and heir, a singularly dirty baby. She remarks that \"An Irish\r\nservant's child in Boston, got up for Sunday, looks far cleaner and\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nThe pacha looked indolent and good-natured, and sent coffee to her\r\nbefore she disembarked at Syra. Here she was met by Mr. Evangelides, the\r\n\"Christy\" of her childhood, the Greek boy befriended by her father. He\r\nwas now a prosperous man in middle life, full of affectionate\r\nremembrance of the family at 16 Bond Street, and of gratitude to \"dear\r\nMr. Ward.\" He welcomed her most cordially, and introduced her not only\r\nto the beauties of Syra, but to its principal inhabitants, the governor\r\nof the Cyclades, the archbishop, and Doctor Hahn, the scientist and\r\nantiquary. She conversed with the archbishop in German.\r\n\r\n\"He deplored the absence of a state religion in America. I told him that\r\nthe progress of religion in our country seemed to establish the fact\r\nthat society attains the best religious culture through the greatest\r\nreligious liberty. He replied that the members should all be united\r\nunder one head. 'Yes,' said I, 'but the Head is invisible'; and he\r\nrepeated after me, 'Indeed, the Head is invisible.' I will here remark\r\nthat nothing could have been more refreshing to the New England mind\r\nthan this immediate introduction to the theological opinions of the\r\nEast.\"\r\n\r\nA few hours later his Grace returned the visit, seeking in his turn, it\r\nwould appear, the refreshment of a new point of view.\r\n\r\n\"We resumed our conversation of the morning, and the celibacy of the\r\nclerical hierarchy came next in order in our discussion. The father was\r\nin something of a strait between the Christian dignification of marriage\r\nand its ascetic depreciation. The arrival of other visitors forced us to\r\npart, with this interesting point still unsettled.\"\r\n\r\nArrived in Athens, the travellers found the \"veteran\" (as the Doctor is\r\ncalled throughout her book) in full tide of work. The apartment in the\r\npleasant hotel swarmed with dark-eyed patriots, with Cretan refugees,\r\nwith old men who had known \"Xaos\" in the brave days of old, with young\r\nmen eager to see and greet the old Philhellene. Among the latter came\r\nMichael Anagnostopoulos, who was to become his secretary, and later his\r\nson-in-law and his successor at the Perkins Institution for the Blind.\r\nThe ladies of Athens came too, full of hospitable feeling. There were\r\nvisits, deputations, committee meetings, all day long, and in the\r\nevening parties and receptions.\r\n\r\nSpite of all this, her first impression of Athens was melancholy. She\r\nwas oppressed and depressed at sight of the havoc wrought by Time and\r\nwar upon monuments that should have been sacred. Speaking of the\r\nParthenon, she exclaims:--\r\n\r\n\"And Pericles caused it to be built; and this, his marble utterance, is\r\nnow a lame sentence, with half its sense left out....\r\n\r\n\"Here is the Temple of Victory. Within are the bas-reliefs of the\r\nVictories arriving in the hurry of their glorious errands. Something so\r\nthey tumbled in upon us when Sherman conquered the Carolinas, and\r\nSheridan the Valley of the Shenandoah, when Lee surrendered, and the\r\nglad President went to Richmond. One of these Victories is untying her\r\nsandal, in token of permanent abiding. Yet all of them have trooped away\r\nlong since, scared by the hideous havoc of barbarians. And the\r\nbas-reliefs, their marble shadows, have all been battered and mutilated\r\ninto the saddest mockery of their original tradition. The statue of\r\nWingless Victory, that stood in the little temple, has long been absent\r\nand unaccounted for. But the only Victory that the Parthenon now can\r\nseize or desire is this very Wingless Victory, the triumph of a power\r\nthat retreats not--the power of Truth.\r\n\r\n\"I give heed to all that is told me in a dreary and desolate manner. It\r\nis true, no doubt,--this was, and this, and this; but what I see is,\r\nnone the less, emptiness,--the broken eggshell of a civilization which\r\nTime has hatched and devoured. And this incapacity to reconstruct the\r\npast goes with me through most of my days in Athens. The city is so\r\nmodern, and its circle so small! The trumpeters who shriek around the\r\nTheseum in the morning, the café-keeper who taxes you for a chair\r\nbeneath the shadow of the Olympian columns, the _custode_ who hangs\r\nabout to see that you do not break the broken marbles further, or carry\r\noff their piteous fragments, all of these are significant of modern\r\nGreece; but the ruins have nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\n\"Poor as these relics are, in comparison with what one would wish them\r\nto be, they are still priceless. This Greek marble is the noblest in\r\ndescent; it needs no eulogy. These forms have given the models for a\r\nhundred familiar and commonplace works, which caught a little gleam of\r\ntheir glory, squaring to shapeliness some town-house of the West, or\r\nSouthern bank or church. So well do we know them in the prose of modern\r\ndesign that we are startled at seeing them transfigured in the poetry of\r\ntheir own conception. Poor old age! poor old columns!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a colony of Cretan refugees at Nauplia, another at Argos, both\r\nin dire need of food and clothing. The Doctor asked the Government for a\r\nsteamer, and received the Parados, in which he promptly embarked with\r\nwife, daughters, and supplies, and sailed for Nauplia.\r\n\r\nThe travelling library of this expedition was reduced to \"a copy of\r\nMachiavelli's '_Principe_,' a volume of Muir's 'Greece,' and a Greek\r\nphrase-book on Ollendorff's principle.\" Our mother also took some\r\nworsted work, but she suffered such lively torment from the bites of\r\nmosquitoes and sand-fleas on her hands and wrists that she could make\r\nlittle use of this. To one recalling the anguish of this visitation, it\r\nseems amazing that she could even write in her Journal; indeed, the\r\nentries, though tolerably regular, are brief and condensed.\r\n\r\n\"_June 24...._ We arrived in the harbor of Nauplia by 7 P.M. ... Crowd\r\nin the street. Bandit's head just cut off and brought in. We go to the\r\nprefect's house, ... he offers us his roof--sends out for mattresses....\r\nI mad with my mosquito bites. Mattresses on the floor. We women lie down\r\nfour in a row, very thankfully....\"\r\n\r\nAt the fortress of Nauplia, she was deeply touched by the sight of a\r\nband of prisoners waiting, in an inner court, for the death to which\r\nthey had been condemned.\r\n\r\n\"'Do not pity them, madam!' said the major; 'they have all done deeds\r\nworthy of death.'\r\n\r\n\"But how not to pity them,\" she cries, \"when they and we are made of the\r\nsame fragile human stuff, that corrupts so easily to crime, and is\r\nalways redeemable, if society would only afford the costly process of\r\nredemption!\r\n\r\n\"As I looked at them, I was struck by a feeling of their helplessness.\r\nWhat is there in the world so helpless as a disarmed criminal? No inner\r\narmor has he to beat back the rude visiting of society; no secure\r\nsoul-citadel, where scorn and anger cannot reach him. He has thrown\r\naway the jewel of his manhood; human law crushes its empty case. But the\r\nfinal Possessor and Creditor is unseen.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Nauplia came Argos, where the Cretan refugees were gathered in\r\nforce. Here the travellers had the great pleasure of helping to clothe\r\nthe half-naked women and children. Many of the garments had been made by\r\nFlorence and her young friends in their sewing circle; the book recalls\r\n\"how the little maidens took off their feathery bonnets and dainty\r\ngloves, wielding the heavy implements of cutting, and eagerly adjusting\r\nthe arms and legs, the gores and gathers! With patient pride the mother\r\ntrotted off to the bakery, that a few buns might sustain these strenuous\r\nlittle cutters and sewers, whose tongues, however active over the\r\ncharitable work, talked, we may be sure, no empty nonsense nor unkind\r\ngossip. For charity begins indeed at home, in the heart, and, descending\r\nto the fingers, rules also the rebellious member whose mischief is often\r\ndone before it is meditated. At sight of these well-made garments a\r\nlittle swelling of the heart seized us, with the love and pride of\r\nremembrance so dear.\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal describes briefly the distribution among the Cretans, \"some\r\nextremely bare and ragged, with suffering little children. Our calico\r\nskirts and sacks made a creditable appearance. We gave with as much\r\njudgment as the short time permitted. Each name was called by a list,\r\nand as they came in we hastily selected garments: the dresses, however,\r\ngave out before we had quite finished.... Ungrateful old woman, who\r\nwanted a gown and would hardly take a chemise. Meddlesome lady of the\r\nneighborhood bringing in her favorites out of order.\"\r\n\r\nGenerous as the supplies from America were, they did not begin to meet\r\nthe demand. After visiting Crete (in spite--perhaps partly because--of\r\nthe fact that a high price was set on his head) and the various colonies\r\nof refugees, the Doctor felt that further aid must be obtained.\r\nAccordingly, the journeyings of the little party after leaving Greece\r\nwere for the most part only less hurried than the earlier ones, the\r\nexception being a week of enchantment spent in Venice, awaiting the\r\nDoctor, who had been called back to Athens at the moment of departure.\r\n\r\nThe Journal tells of Verona, Innsbrück, Munich. Then came flying\r\nglimpses of Switzerland, with a few days' rest at Geneva, where she had\r\nthe happiness of meeting her sister once more; finally, Paris and the\r\nExposition of 1867.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to Napoleon's tomb, she writes: \"Spent much of the\r\nafternoon in beginning a piece of tapestry after a Pompeiian pattern\r\ncopied by me on the spot.\"\r\n\r\nWorsted work was an unfailing accompaniment of her journeyings in those\r\ndays; indeed, until age and weariness came upon her, she never failed to\r\nhave some piece of work on hand. When her eyes could no longer compass\r\ncross-stitch embroidery, she amused herself with knitting, or with\r\n\"hooking\" small rugs.\r\n\r\nHer sketchbook was another resource while travelling. She had no special\r\ntalent for drawing, but took great pleasure in it, and was constantly\r\nmaking pencil sketches of persons and things that interested her. We\r\neven find patterns of Pompeiian mosaic or of historic needlework\r\nreproduced in the Journal.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris the travellers hurried to Belgium, and after a glance at\r\nBrussels, spent several days in Antwerp with great contentment. Both\r\nhere and in Brussels she had been much interested in the beautiful lace\r\ndisplayed on every hand. She made several modest purchases, not without\r\nvisitings of conscience.\r\n\r\n\"I went to the Cathedral.... I saw to-day the Elevation of the Cross\r\n[Rubens] to special advantage. As I stood before it, I felt lifted for a\r\nmoment above the mean and foolish pleasures of shopping, etc., on which\r\nI have of late dwelt so largely. The heroic face before me said, 'You\r\ncannot have those and these, cannot have Christian elevation with\r\nheathen triviality.' That moment showed me what a picture can do. I hope\r\nI shall remember it, though I do plead guilty of late to an\r\nextraordinary desire for finery of all sorts. It is as if I were going\r\nhome to play the part of Princess in some great drama, which is not at\r\nall likely to be the case.\"\r\n\r\nYet the same day she went to the beguinage and bought \"Flossy's wedding\r\nhdkf, 22 frc--lace scarf, 3 fr., piece of edging, 4 fr.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the notabilities of Antwerp in those days was Charles Félu, the\r\narmless painter. He was to be seen every day in the Museum, copying the\r\ngreat masters with skill and fidelity. He interested the Doctor greatly,\r\nand the whole party made acquaintance with him. A letter from one of\r\nthem describes the meeting with this singular man:--\r\n\r\n\"As we were looking round at the pictures, I noticed a curious painting\r\narrangement. There was a platform raised about a foot above the floor,\r\nwith two stools, one in front of the other, and an easel. Presently the\r\nartist entered. The first thing he did, on stepping on the platform, was\r\nto kick off his shoes. He then seated himself (Heaven knows how) on one\r\nstool and placed his feet in front of him on the other, close before the\r\neasel. I was surprised to see that his stockings had no toes to them.\r\nBut my surprise was much greater when I saw him take the palette in one\r\nfoot and the brush in the other, and begin to paint. The nicety with\r\nwhich he picked out his brushes, rubbed the paints, erased with his\r\ngreat toe, etc., was a mystery to me.... In a few minutes he put his\r\nfoot into his pocket, drew out a paper from which he took his card, and\r\n_footed_ it politely to papa.... He shaves himself, plays billiards (and\r\nwell, too), cards, and dominoes, cuts up his meat and feeds himself,\r\netc.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 1._ By accident went to the same hotel [in Bruges] to which I\r\nwent twenty-four years ago, a bride. I recognized a staircase with a\r\nbalustrade of swans each holding a stiff bulrush in its mouth.... Made a\r\nlittle verse thereupon.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Belgium the way led to London; thence, after a brief and delightful\r\nvisit to the Bracebridges at Atherstone, to Liverpool, where the China\r\nawaited her passengers. The voyage was long and stormy, thirteen days:\r\nthe Journal speaks chiefly of its discomforts; but on the second Sunday\r\nwe read: \"X. preached a horrible sermon--stood up and mocked at\r\nphilosophy in good English and bad Christianity. He failed alike of\r\nsatire and of sense, and talked like a small Pharisee of two thousand\r\nyears ago. 'Not much like the Sermon on the Mount,' quoth I; not\r\ntheology enough to stand examination at Andover. Bluejackets in a row,\r\nunedified, as were most of us.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 25 the travellers landed in Boston, thankful to be again on\r\nfirm land, and to see the family unit once more complete.\r\n\r\n\"The dear children came on board to greet us--all well, and very happy\r\nat our return.\"\r\n\r\nThus ends the story, seven months of wonder and of delight.\r\n\r\nAt her Club, soon after, she gave the following epitome of the trip,\r\nsinging the doggerel lines to an improvised tune which matched them in\r\nabsurdity:--\r\n\r\n  Oh! who were the people you saw, Mrs. Howe,\r\n  When you went where the Cretans were making a row?\r\n  Kalopathaki--Rodocanachi--\r\n  Paparipopoulos--Anagnostopoulos--\r\n  Nicolaïdes--Paraskevaïdes--\r\n  These were the people that saw Mrs. Howe\r\n  When she went where the Cretans were making a row.\r\n\r\n  Oh! what were the projects you made, Mrs. Howe,\r\n  When you went where the Cretans were making a row?\r\n  Emancipation--civilization--redintegration of a great nation,\r\n  Paying no taxes, grinding no axes--\r\n  Flinging the Ministers over the banisters.\r\n  These were the projects of good Mrs. Howe\r\n  When she went where the Cretans were making a row.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Oh! give us a specimen, dear Mrs. Howe,\r\n  Of the Greek that you learned and are mistress of now.\r\n  Potichomania--Mesopotamia.\r\n  Tatterdemalion--episcopalian--\r\n  Megalotherium--monster inferium--\r\n  Scoulevon--auctrion--infant phenomenon.\r\n  Kyrie ticamete--what's your calamity?\r\n  Pallas Athenae Aun,\r\n  Favors no Fenian.\r\n  Such is the language that learned Mrs. Howe,\r\n  In the speech of the Gods she is mistress of now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCONCERNING CLUBS\r\n\r\n1867-1871; _aet._ 48-52\r\n\r\n  \"Behold,\" he said, \"Life's great impersonate,\r\n        Nourished by labor!\r\n  Thy gods are gone with old-time faith and fate;\r\n        Here is thy Neighbor.\"\r\n\r\n                        J. W. H., \"A New Sculptor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter such a rush of impression and emotion, the return to everyday life\r\ncould not fail to bring about a corresponding drop in our mother's\r\nmental barometer. Vexations awaited her. The Boylston Place house had\r\nbeen let for a year, and--Green Peace being also let on a long\r\nlease--the reunited family took refuge for the winter in the \"Doctor's\r\nWing\" of the Perkins Institution.\r\n\r\nAgain, an extremely unfavorable critique of \"Later Lyrics\" in a\r\nprominent review distressed her greatly; her health was more or less\r\ndisturbed; above all, the sudden death of John A. Andrew, the beloved\r\nand honored friend of many years, saddened both her and the Doctor\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\nAll these things affected her spirits to some extent, so that the\r\nJournal for the remainder of 1867 is in a minor key.\r\n\r\n\"... In despair about the house....\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the separation of Charles Sumner from his wife:--\r\n\r\n\"For men and women to come together is nature--for them to live\r\ntogether is art--to live well, high art.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 21._ Melancholy, thinking that I did but poorly last evening\r\n[at a reading from her 'Notes on Travel' at the Church of the\r\nDisciples].... At the afternoon concert felt a savage and tearful\r\nmelancholy, a profound friendlessness. In the whole large assembly I saw\r\nno one who would help me to do anything worthy of my powers and\r\nlife-ideal. I have so dreamed of high use that I cannot decline to a\r\nlife of amusement or of small occupation.\"\r\n\r\n\"... I believe in God, but am utterly weary of man.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a disappointment:--\r\n\r\n\"... To church, where my mental condition speedily improved. Sermon on\r\nthe Good Samaritan. Hymns and prayers all congenial and consoling. Felt\r\nmuch consoled and uplifted out of all petty discords and\r\ndisappointments. A disappointment should be digested in patience, not\r\nvomited in spleen. Bitter morsels nourish the soul, not less perhaps\r\nthan sweet. Thought of the following: Moral philosophy begins with the\r\nfact of accepting human life.\"\r\n\r\nIn November came a new interest which was to mean much to her.\r\n\r\n\"Early in town to attend the Free Religious Club. Weiss's essay was well\r\nwritten, but encumbered with illustrations rarely pertinent. It was\r\nneither religion, philosophy, nor cosmology, but a confusion of all\r\nthree, showing the encyclopædic aim of his culture. It advocated the\r\nnatural to the exclusion of the supernatural. Being invited to speak, I\r\nsuggested real and ideal as a better antithesis for thought than\r\nnatural and supernatural. Weiss did all that his method would allow. He\r\nis a man of parts. I cannot determine how much, but the Parkerian\r\nstandard, or a similar one, has deformed his reasoning powers. He seeks\r\nsomething better than Christianity without having half penetrated the\r\ninner significance of that religion.\r\n\r\n\"Alcott spoke in the idealistic direction. Also Wasson very well.\r\nLucretia Mott exceptionally well, a little rambling, but with true\r\nwomanly intuitions of taste and of morality.\"\r\n\r\nThis association of thinkers was afterwards known as the \"Boston Radical\r\nClub.\" She has much to say about it in her \"Reminiscences.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, indeed,\" she says, \"hear at these meetings much that pained and\r\neven irritated me. The disposition to seek outside the limits of\r\nChristianity for all that is noble and inspiring in religious culture,\r\nand to recognize especially within these limits the superstition and\r\nintolerance which have been the bane of all religions--this disposition,\r\nwhich was frequently manifested both in the essays presented and in\r\ntheir discussion, offended not only my affections, but also my sense of\r\njustice....\r\n\r\n\"Setting this one point aside, I can but speak of the Club as a high\r\ncongress of souls, in which many noble thoughts were uttered. Nobler\r\nthan any special view or presentation was the general sense of the\r\ndignity of human character and of its affinity with things divine, which\r\nalways gave the master tone to the discussions.\"\r\n\r\nShe says elsewhere of the Radical Club:--\r\n\r\n\"The really radical feature in it was the fact that the thoughts\r\npresented at its meetings had a root; were in that sense radical....\r\nHere I have heard Wendell Phillips, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, John\r\nWeiss and James Freeman Clarke, Athanase Coquerel, the noble French\r\nProtestant preacher; William Henry Channing, worthy nephew of his great\r\nuncle; Colonel Higginson, Doctor Bartol, and many others. Extravagant\r\nthings were sometimes said, no doubt, and the equilibrium of ordinary\r\npersuasion was not infrequently disturbed for a time. But the\r\nsatisfaction of those present when a sound basis of thought was\r\nvindicated and established is indeed pleasant in remembrance....\"\r\n\r\n\"To Dickens's second reading, which I enjoyed very much. The 'wreck' in\r\n'David Copperfield' was finely given. His appearance is against success;\r\nthe face is rather commonplace, seen at a distance, and very red if seen\r\nthrough a glass: the voice worn and _blasé_.\"\r\n\r\n\"... Club in the evening, at which my nonsense made people laugh, as I\r\nwished....\"\r\n\r\n\"A little intoxicated with the pleasure of having made people laugh. A\r\nfool, however, can often do this better than a wise man. I look\r\nearnestly for a higher task. Yet innocent, intelligent laughter is not\r\nto be despised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was taken with verses in church. They did not prove nearly as good as I\r\nhad hoped....\"\r\n\r\n\"Made three beds, to help Bridget, who had the washing alone. Read a\r\ndifficult chapter in Fichte.\"\r\n\r\n\"Studied and worried as usual,--Fichte and Greek....\"\r\n\r\n\"Have not been strenuous enough about the Cretan Fair....\"\r\n\r\nAny lack of strenuousness about the Cretan Fair was amply atoned for.\r\n\r\nAn \"Appeal\" was published, written by her and signed by Julia Ward Howe,\r\nEmily Talbot, Sarah E. Lawrence, Caroline A. Mudge, and Abby W. May.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we say? They are a great way off, but they are starving and\r\nperishing, as none in our midst can starve and perish, and we Americans\r\nare among the few persons to whom they can look for help.\"\r\n\r\nIn this cry for aid we hear the voice of both parents. The response was\r\ncordial and generous. The fair was held in Easter Week, at the Boston\r\nMusic Hall, and recalled on a smaller scale the glories of the war-time\r\nfairs. Of the great labor of preparation, the Journal gives a lively\r\nimpression; and \"speaking for Crete\" was added to the other burdens\r\nborne by her and the Doctor.\r\n\r\nShe could not give up her studies; the entries for the winter of 1867-68\r\nare a curious mingling of Fichte and committees, with here and there a\r\nprayer for spiritual help and guidance, which shows her overwrought\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAnother interest had come to her from the visit to Greece: the study of\r\nancient Greek. Latin had been her lifelong friend, but she had always\r\nlonged for the sister classic; now the time was ripe for it. She made a\r\nbeginning in Athens, not only picking up a good deal of modern Greek,\r\nbut attacking the ancient language with the aid of primer and\r\nphrase-book. A valuable teacher was at hand in Michael Anagnos,[67] who\r\nwas aiding the Doctor as secretary, and preparing himself for the\r\nprincipal work of his life. Anagnos encouraged and assisted her in the\r\nnew study, which became one of her greatest delights. She looked forward\r\nto a Greek lesson as girls do to a ball; in later life she was wont to\r\nsay, \"My Greek is my diamond necklace!\"\r\n\r\n  [67] Formerly Anagnostopoulos. He dropped the last three syllables soon\r\n  after coming to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_January 1, 1868._ May I this year have energy, patience, good-will and\r\ngood faith. May I be guilty of no treason against duty and my best self.\r\nMay I acquire more system, order, and wisdom in the use of things. May\r\nI, if God wills, carry out some of my plans for making my studies useful\r\nto others. This is much to ask, but not too much of Him who giveth all.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 24._ A dreadfully busy day. Meeting of General Committee on\r\nCretan Fair....

The\r\njoyous belief that his doctrine of influences can keep me from all that\r\nI should most greatly dread, lifts me up like a pair of strong wings. 'I\r\nshall run and not be weary. I shall walk and not faint.' At church the\r\nfirst hymn contained this line:--\r\n\r\n  \"'Her fathers' God before her moved'--\r\n\r\nwhich quite impressed me, for my father's piety and the excellence of\r\nother departed relatives have always of late years been a support and\r\npledge to me of my own good behavior.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The thief's heart, the wanton's brow, may accompany high talent and\r\ngeniality of temperament; but thanks be to God they _need_ not.\"\r\n\r\n\"... Wished I could make a fine poetic picture of Paul preaching at Mars\r\nHill. On the one side, the glittering statues and brilliant\r\nmythology--on the other, the simplicity of the Christian life and\r\ndoctrine. But to-day no pictures came.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Got Anagnos to help me read two odes of Anacreon.

I was feeble in mind and body, and\r\nbrooded over the loss of the lesson in a silly manner.

I confess that to lay down Greek now would be to die,\r\nlike Moses, in sight of the promised land. All my life I have longed for\r\nthis language....\"\r\n\r\n\"All of these days are mixed of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. I am\r\npretty well content with my work, not as well with myself. I feel the\r\nneed of earnest prayer and divine help....\"\r\n\r\n\"I had been invited to read the essay to the Radical Religious Club on\r\nthis day at 10 A.M. I asked leave for Anagnos and took him with me. My\r\ndæmon [Socratic] had told me to read 'Doubt and Belief,' so I chose this\r\nand read it. I find my dæmon justified. It seemed to have a certain\r\nfitness in calling forth discussion. Mr. Emerson first spoke very\r\nbeautifully, then Mr. Alcott, these two sympathizing in my view. Wasson\r\nfollowed, a little off, but with a very friendly contrast.... Much of\r\nthis talk was very interesting. It was all marked by power and\r\nsincerity, but Emerson and Alcott understood my essay better than the\r\nothers except J. F. C. I introduced Anagnos to Emerson. I told him that\r\nhe had seen the Olympus of New England. Thought of my dear lost son,\r\ndead in this house [13 Chestnut Street, where the meeting was held].\r\nAnagnos is a dear son to me. I brought him home to dinner, and count\r\nthis a happy day.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I have heard the true word of God to-day from Frederick Hedge--a sermon\r\non Love as the true bond of society, which lifted my weak soul as on the\r\nstrong wings of a cherub. The immortal truths easily lost sight of in\r\nour everyday weakness and passion stood out to-day so strong and clear\r\nthat I felt their healing power as if Christ had stood and touched my\r\nblinded eyes with his divine finger. So be it always! _Esto perpetua!_\"\r\n\r\nOn April 13 the fair opened; a breathless week followed. She was much\r\nexhausted after it, but in a few days \"began to rehearse for\r\nFestival.\"[68]\r\n\r\n  [68] The Handel and Haydn Festival.\r\n\r\n\"After extreme depression, I begin to take heart a little. Almighty God\r\nhelp me!\r\n\r\n\"Greek lesson--rehearsal in the evening--choral symphony and\r\n_Lobgesang_.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1868 she had great pleasure in reading some of her\r\nessays at Newport, in the Unitarian Church. She notes in her\r\n\"Reminiscences\" that one lady kissed her after the reading, saying,\r\n\"This is the way I want to hear women speak\"; and that Mrs. P---- S----,\r\non hearing the words, \"If God works, madam, you can afford to work\r\nalso!\" rose and went out, saying, \"I won't listen to such stuff as\r\nthis!\"\r\n\r\nThe parlor readings brought her name into wider prominence. She began to\r\nreceive invitations to read and speak in public.\r\n\r\nMr. Emerson wrote to her concerning her philosophical readings: \"The\r\nscheme is excellent--to read thus--so new and rare, yet so grateful to\r\nall parties. It costs genius to invent our simplest pleasures.\"\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1867-68 saw the birth of another institution which was to\r\nbe of lifelong interest to her: the New England Woman's Club. This, one\r\nof the earliest of women's clubs, was organized on February 16, 1868,\r\nwith Mrs. Caroline M. Severance, in whose mind the idea had first taken\r\nshape, as president. Its constitution announces the objects of the\r\nassociation as \"primarily, to furnish a quiet, central resting-place,\r\nand place of meeting in Boston, for the comfort and convenience of its\r\nmembers: and ultimately to become an organized social centre for united\r\nthought and action.\"\r\n\r\nHow far the second clause has outdone and outshone the first, is known\r\nto all who know anything of the history of women's clubs. From the New\r\nEngland Woman's Club and its cousin Sorosis, founded a month later in\r\nNew York, has grown the great network of clubs which, like a beneficent\r\nrailway system of thought and good-will, penetrates every nook and\r\ncorner of this country.\r\n\r\nOur mother was one of the first vice-presidents of the Club, and from\r\n1871 to her death in 1910, with two brief intervals, its president.\r\nAmong all the many associations with which she was connected this was\r\nperhaps the nearest to her heart. \"My dear Club!\" no other organization\r\nbrought such a tender ring to her voice. She never willingly missed a\r\nmeeting; the monthly teas were among her great delights. The Journal has\r\nmuch to say about the Club: \"a good meeting\"; \"a thoughtful, earnest\r\nmeeting,\" are frequent entries. \"Why!\" she cried once, \"we may be living\r\nin the Millennium without knowing it!\"\r\n\r\nIn her \"Reminiscences,\" after telling how she attended the initial\r\nmeeting, and \"gave a languid assent to the measure proposed,\" she\r\nadds:--\r\n\r\n\"Out of this small beginning was gradually developed the plan of the New\r\nEngland Woman's Club, a strong and stately association, destined, I\r\nbelieve, to last for many years, and having behind it, at this time of\r\nmy writing, a record of three decades of happy and acceptable service.\"\r\n\r\nThe Club movement was henceforth to be one of her widest interests. To\r\nthousands of elder women in the late sixties and early seventies it\r\ncame like a new gospel of activity and service. They had reared their\r\nchildren and seen them take flight; moreover, they had fought through\r\nthe war, their hearts in the field, their fingers plying needle and\r\nthread. They had been active in committees and commissions the country\r\nover; had learned to work with and beside men, finding joy and\r\ncompanionship and inspiration in such work. How could they go back to\r\nthe chimney-corner life of the fifties? In answer to their question--an\r\nanswer from Heaven, it seemed--came the women's clubs, with their\r\nopportunities for self-culture and for public service.\r\n\r\nAt first Society looked askance at the movement. What? Women's clubs?\r\nThey would take women away from the Home, which was their Sphere!\r\nShocking! Besides, it might make them Strong-Minded! Horrible! (\"But,\"\r\nsaid J. W. H., \"I would rather be strong-minded than weak-minded!\")\r\n\r\nPossibly influenced in some measure by such plaints as these, the early\r\nclubs devoted themselves for the most part to study, and their range of\r\nactivities was strictly limited and defined. This, however, could not\r\nlast. The Doctor used to say, \"You may as well refuse to let out the\r\ngrowing boy's trousers as refuse larger and larger liberty to his\r\ngrowing individuality!\" Even so the club petticoats had to be lengthened\r\nand amplified.\r\n\r\nOur mother, with all her love of study, realized that no individual or\r\ngroup of individuals must neglect the present with its living issues for\r\nany past, however beautiful. She threw her energies into widening the\r\nclub horizon. \"Don't tie too many _nots_ in your constitution!\" she\r\nwould say to a young club; and then she would tell how Florence\r\nNightingale cut the Gordian knots of red tape in the Crimea.\r\n\r\nDid the constitution enforce such and such limits? Ah! but committees\r\nwere not thus limited; let a committee be appointed, to do what the club\r\ncould not! (This was what the Doctor called \"whipping the devil round\r\nthe stump!\")\r\n\r\nMany and many a reform had its beginning in one of those quiet Park\r\nStreet rooms of the \"N. E. W. C.\" \"When I want anything in Boston\r\nremedied,\" said Edward Everett Hale, \"I go down to the New England\r\nWoman's Club!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the General Federation of Women's Clubs was formed in 1892, our\r\nmother served on the board of directors for four years, and was then\r\nmade an honorary vice-president. She was also president of the\r\nMassachusetts State Federation from 1893 to 1898, and thereafter\r\nhonorary president.\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes once said to her, \"Mrs. Howe, I consider you eminently\r\nclubable\"; and he added that he himself was not. He told us why, when he\r\nadopted the title of \"Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table.\" The most\r\nbrilliant of talkers, he did not care to listen, as a good club member\r\nmust. Now, she too loved talking, but perhaps she loved listening even\r\nmore. No one who knew her in her later years can forget how intently she\r\nlistened, how joyously she received information of any and every kind.\r\nShe never was tired; she always wanted more. All human experience\r\nthrilled her; the choreman, the dressmaker, the postman, the caller; one\r\nand all, she hung on their words. After a half-hour with her, seeing her\r\nface alight with sympathy, her delicate lips often actually forming the\r\nwords as he spoke them, the dullest person might go away on air, feeling\r\nhimself a born _raconteur_. What she said once of Mr. Emerson, \"He\r\nalways came into a room as if he expected to receive more than he gave!\"\r\nwas true of herself.\r\n\r\nTo return to the clubs! At a biennial meeting of the General Federation\r\nin Philadelphia, she said: \"What did the club life give me?\r\nUnderstanding of my own sex; faith in its moral and intellectual growth.\r\nLike so many others, I saw the cruel wrongs and vexed problems of our\r\nsocial life, but I did not know that hidden away in its own midst was a\r\nreserve force destined to give precious aid in the righting of wrongs,\r\nand in the solution of discords. In the women's clubs I found the\r\nimmense power which sympathy exercises in bringing out the best\r\naspirations of the woman nature.... To guard against dangers, we must do\r\nour utmost to uphold and keep in view the high object which has, in the\r\nfirst instance, called us together; and let this be no mere party\r\ncatchword or cry, as East against West, or North against South. We can\r\nafford to meet as citizens of one common country, and to love and serve\r\nthe whole as one.\"\r\n\r\nShe believed firmly in maintaining the privacy of club life. \"The club\r\nis a larger home,\" she said, \"and we wish to have the immunities and\r\ndefences of home; therefore we do not wish the public present, even by\r\nits attorney, the reporter.\"\r\n\r\nThe three following years were important ones to the Howe family.\r\n\r\nLawton's Valley was sold, to our great and lasting grief: and--after a\r\nsummer spent at Stevens Cottage near Newport--the Doctor bought the\r\nplace now known as \"Oak Glen,\" scarce half a mile from the Valley; a\r\nplace to become only less dear to the family. No. 19 Boylston Place was\r\nalso sold, and he bought No. 32 Mount Vernon Street, a sunny, pleasant\r\nhouse whose spacious rooms and tall windows recalled the Chestnut Street\r\nhouse, always regretted.\r\n\r\nHere life circled ever faster and faster, fuller and fuller. Our father,\r\nthough beginning to feel the weight of years, had not yet begun to \"take\r\nin sail,\" but continued to pile labor on labor, adding the new while\r\nnever abandoning the old. For our mother clubs, societies, studies were\r\nmultiplying, while for both family cares and interests were becoming\r\nmore and more complicated. The children were now mostly grown. To the\r\nmother's constant thought and anxiety about their teeth, their hair,\r\ntheir eyes, their music, their dancing--to say nothing of the weightier\r\nmatters of the law--was added the consideration of their ball dresses,\r\ntheir party slippers, their partners. She went with the daughters to\r\nball and assembly; if they danced, she was happy; if not, there was\r\ngrief behind the cheerful smile, and a sigh was confided to the Journal\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nRomance hovered over No. 32 Mount Vernon Street. The Greek lessons\r\nwhich were to mean so much to Julia and Laura were brought to a sudden\r\nend by the engagement of Julia to the Greek teacher, Michael Anagnos.\r\nFlorence (who was now housekeeper, lightening our mother's cares\r\ngreatly) was already engaged to David Prescott Hall; while Laura's\r\nengagement to Henry Richards was announced shortly after Julia's.\r\n\r\nThe three marriages followed at intervals of a few months. Meantime\r\nHarry, whose youthful pranks had been the terror of both parents, had\r\ngraduated from Harvard, and was now, after two years[69] at the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, beginning his chosen work as a\r\nmetallurgist.\r\n\r\n  [69] 1869-1871. He took the course of geology and mining engineering,\r\n  graduating at the head of his class.\r\n\r\nShe wrote of this beloved son:--\r\n\r\n  God gave my son a palace,\r\n    And a kingdom to control;\r\n  The palace of his body,\r\n    The kingdom of his soul.\r\n\r\nIn childhood and boyhood this \"palace\" was inhabited by a tricksy\r\nsprite. At two years Harry was pulling the tails of the little dogs on\r\nthe Roman Pincio; at eighteen he was filling the breasts of the college\r\nauthorities with the same emotions inspired by his father in the\r\nprevious generation.\r\n\r\n\"Howe,\" said the old President of Brown University, when the Chevalier\r\ncalled to pay his respects on his return from Greece, \"I am afraid of\r\nyou now! There may be a fire-cracker under my chair at this moment!\"\r\n\r\nOnce out of college, it fared with the son as with the father. The\r\ncurrent of restless energy hitherto devoted to \"monkey shines\" (as the\r\nDoctor called them) was now turned into another channel. Work, hardly\r\nless arduous and unremitting than his father's, became the habit of his\r\nlife. Science claimed him, and her he served with the same singleness of\r\npurpose, the same intensity of devotion with which his parents served\r\nthe causes that claimed them. He married, in 1874, Fannie, daughter of\r\nWillard Gay, of Troy, New York.\r\n\r\nWe love to recall the time at this house on Beacon Hill. We remember it\r\nas a cheerful house, ringing with song and laughter, yet with a steady\r\nundercurrent of work and thought; the \"precious time,\" not to be\r\ninterrupted; the coming and going of grave men and earnest women, all\r\nbent on high and hopeful errands, all seeking our two Wise Ones for\r\ncounsel, aid, sympathy; the coming and going also of a steady stream of\r\n\"lame ducks\" of both sexes and all nationalities, all requiring help,\r\nmost of them getting it; yet, as ever, the father leaving State\r\nCharities and Reforms, the mother flying from Fichte or Xenophon, at any\r\nreal or fancied need of any child. It is thus that we love to think of\r\nNo. 32 Mount Vernon Street, the last of the many homes in which we were\r\nall together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE CRUSADE\r\n\r\n1870-1872; _aet._ 51-53\r\n\r\nENDEAVOR\r\n\r\n  \"What hast thou for thy scattered seed,\r\n    O Sower of the plain?\r\n  Where are the many gathered sheaves\r\n    Thy hope should bring again?\"\r\n  \"The only record of my work\r\n    Lies in the buried grain.\"\r\n\r\n  \"O Conqueror of a thousand fields!\r\n    In dinted armor dight,\r\n  What growths of purple amaranth\r\n    Shall crown thy brow of might?\"\r\n  \"Only the blossom of my life\r\n    Flung widely in the fight.\"\r\n\r\n  \"What is the harvest of thy saints,\r\n    O God! who dost abide?\r\n  Where grow the garlands of thy chiefs\r\n    In blood and sorrow dyed?\r\n  What have thy servants for their pains?\"\r\n    \"This only,--to have tried.\"\r\n\r\n                                         J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a branch is cut from a vigorous tree, Nature at once sets to work\r\nto adjust matters. New juices flow, new tissues form, the wound is\r\nscarfed over, and after a time is seen only as a scar. Not here, but\r\nelsewhere, does the new growth take place, the fresh green shoots\r\nappear, more vigorous for the pruning.\r\n\r\nThus it was with our mother's life, as one change after another came\r\nacross it. Little Sam died, and her heart withered with him: then\r\nreligion and study came to her aid, and through them she reached\r\nanother blossoming time of thought and accomplishment Now, with the\r\nmarriage and departure of the children, still another notable change was\r\nwrought, rather joyful than sorrowful, but none the less marking an\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nUp to this time (1871) the wide, sunny rooms of the house on Beacon Hill\r\nhad been filled with young, active life. The five children, their\r\nfriends, their music, their parties, their talk and laughter, kept youth\r\nand gayety at full tide: the green branches grew and blossomed.\r\n\r\nFor all five she had been from their cradle not only mistress of the\r\nrevels and chief musician, but spur and beacon of mind and soul.\r\n\r\nNow four of the five were transplanted to other ground. Many women,\r\nconfronting changes like these, say to themselves, \"It is over. For me\r\nthere is no more active life; instead, the shelf and the chimney\r\ncorner.\" This woman, lifting her eyes from the empty spaces, saw\r\nOpportunity beckoning from new heights, and moved gladly to meet her.\r\nNow, as ever, she \"staked her life upon the red.\"\r\n\r\nThe empty spaces must be filled. Study no longer sufficed: the need of\r\nserving humanity actively, hand and foot, pen and voice, was now urgent.\r\n\r\nHer first work under this new impulse was for peace. The Franco-Prussian\r\nWar of 1870 made a deep and painful impression upon her. She had felt a\r\nbitter dislike for Louis Napoleon ever since the day when he \"stabbed\r\nFrance in her sleep\" by the _Coup d'État_ of December, 1851; but she\r\nloved France and the French people; the overwhelming defeat, the bitter\r\nhumiliation suffered by them filled her with sorrow and indignation. In\r\na lecture on Paris she says: \"The great Exposition of 1867 had drawn\r\ntogether an immense crowd from all parts of the world. Among its\r\nmarvels, my recollection dwells most upon the gallery of French\r\npaintings, in which I stood more than once before a full-length portrait\r\nof the then Emperor.[70] I looked into the face which seemed to say: 'I\r\nhave succeeded. What has any one to say about it?' And I pondered the\r\nslow movements of that heavenly Justice whose infallible decrees are not\r\nto be evaded.\"\r\n\r\n  [70] Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nHer \"Reminiscences\" say: \"As I was revolving these matters in my mind,\r\nwhile the war was still in progress, I was visited by a sudden feeling\r\nof the cruel and unnecessary character of the contest. It seemed to me a\r\nreturn to barbarism, the issue having been one which might easily have\r\nbeen settled without bloodshed. The question forced itself upon me, 'Why\r\ndo not the mothers of mankind interfere in these matters, to prevent the\r\nwaste of that human life of which they alone bear and know the cost?' I\r\nhad never thought of this before. The august dignity of motherhood and\r\nits terrible responsibilities now appeared to me in a new aspect, and I\r\ncould think of no better way of expressing my sense of these than that\r\nof sending forth an appeal to womanhood throughout the world, which I\r\nthen and there composed.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal is dated Boston, September, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEAL TO WOMANHOOD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD\r\n\r\n     Again, in the sight of the Christian world, have the skill and\r\n     power of two great nations exhausted themselves in mutual murder.\r\n     Again have the sacred questions of international justice been\r\n     committed to the fatal mediation of military weapons. In this day\r\n     of progress, in this century of light, the ambition of rulers has\r\n     been allowed to barter the dear interests of domestic life for the\r\n     bloody exchanges of the battle-field. Thus men have done. Thus men\r\n     will do. But women need no longer be made a party to proceedings\r\n     which fill the globe with grief and horror. Despite the assumptions\r\n     of physical force, the mother has a sacred and commanding word to\r\n     say to the sons who owe their life to her suffering. That word\r\n     should now be heard, and answered to as never before.\r\n\r\n     Arise, then, Christian women of this day! Arise, all women who have\r\n     hearts, whether your baptism be that of water or of tears! Say\r\n     firmly: \"We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant\r\n     agencies. Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage,\r\n     for caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be taken from us to\r\n     unlearn all that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy\r\n     and patience. We, women of one country, will be too tender of those\r\n     of another country, to allow our sons to be trained to injure\r\n     theirs.\" From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up\r\n     with our own. It says: \"Disarm, disarm! The sword of murder is not\r\n     the balance of justice.\" Blood does not wipe out dishonor, nor\r\n     violence indicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plough\r\n     and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that\r\n     may be left of home for a great and earnest day of counsel.\r\n\r\n     Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead.\r\n     Let them then solemnly take counsel with each other as to the means\r\n     whereby the great human family can live in peace, man as the\r\n     brother of man, each bearing after his own kind the sacred\r\n     impress, not of Cæsar, but of God.\r\n\r\n     In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask that a\r\n     general congress of women, without limit of nationality, may be\r\n     appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient, and at the\r\n     earliest period consistent with its objects, to promote the\r\n     alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of\r\n     international questions, the great and general interests of peace.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was translated into French, Spanish, Italian, German, and\r\nSwedish, and sent broadcast far and wide.\r\n\r\nIn October our mother wrote to Aaron Powell, president of the American\r\nPeace Society: \"The issue is one which will unite virtually the whole\r\nsex. God gave us, I think, the word to say, but it ought to be followed\r\nby immediate and organizing action.... Now, you, my dear sir, are bound,\r\nas a Friend and as an Advocate of Peace, to take especial interest in\r\nthis matter, so I call upon you a little confidently, hoping that you\r\nwill help my unbusinesslike and unskilful hands to go on with this good\r\nwork. I wish to avoid occasioning any confusion in the different\r\nmeetings and organizations of the Woman Suffrage Movement. But I should\r\nwish to move for various meetings in which the matter of my appeal, the\r\ndirect intervention of Woman in the Pacification of the World, should be\r\ndiscussed, and the final move of a general Congress promoted. Please\r\ntake hold a little now and help me. I have wings but no feet nor\r\nhands--rather, only a voice, '_vox et praeterea nihil_.'\"\r\n\r\nThe next step was to call together those persons supposedly interested\r\nin such a movement. In December, 1870, it was announced that a meeting\r\n\"for the purpose of considering and arranging the steps necessary to be\r\ntaken for calling a World's Congress of Women in behalf of International\r\nPeace\" would be held in Union League Hall, Madison Avenue and\r\nTwenty-sixth Street, New York, on Friday, December 23. The announcement,\r\nwhich sets forth the need for and objects of such a congress, is signed\r\nby Julia Ward Howe, William Cullen Bryant, and Mary F. Davis.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was an important one: there were addresses by Lucretia Mott,\r\nOctavius Frothingham, and Alfred Love, the Peace prophet of\r\nPhiladelphia; letters from John Stuart Mill, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and\r\nWilliam Howard Furness, who adjures peace-lovers to \"labor for the\r\nestablishment of a Supreme Court to which all differences between\r\nnations shall be referred for settlement.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Howe made the opening address, from which we quote these words:--\r\n\r\n\"So I repeat my call and cry to women. Let it pierce through dirt and\r\nrags--let it pierce through velvet and cashmere. It is the call of\r\nhumanity. It says: 'Help others, and you help yourselves.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Let the woman seize and bear about the prophetic word of the hour, and\r\nthat word becomes flesh, and dwells among men. This rapturous task of\r\nhope, this perpetual evangel of good news, is the woman's special\r\nbusiness, if she only knew it.\r\n\r\n\"Patience and passivity are sometimes in place for women--not always. I\r\nthink of this when I go to women, intelligent and charming, who warn me\r\noff with white hands, unaccustomed to any graver labor than that of\r\ngesticulation. 'Don't ask me to work,' they say; 'I cannot do it. God\r\nalways raises up a set of people to do these things, like the\r\nAnti-Slavery people, and they set to work to do them.' And then I want\r\nto say to these friends: 'God can raise you up too, and I hope He will.'\r\n\r\n\"As for what one can or cannot do, remember that, active or passive, we\r\nmust work to live. If we have not real labor, we must have simulated\r\nexercise. If we have not real objects, we must have fanciful caprices,\r\nlittle less exertion than keeps us in the padded chair would take us out\r\nof it, and send us to try whether nature has made any special exemption\r\nin our cases, and whether the paralysis of our life need be traced\r\nfurther outward than our self-centred heart....\r\n\r\n\"Would that I were still young, as are many of you; would at least that\r\nI had followed the angel of my youth as gravely and steadfastly as he\r\ninvited me; but the world taught, applauded in another direction, and I\r\nwas at fault. But from this assembly a will might go forth, an earnest\r\nwill, quick with love, and heavy with meaning. And this will might say\r\nto our sisters all over the world, 'Trifle no more.' If women did not\r\nwaste life in frivolity, men would not waste it in murder. For the\r\ntenderness of the one class is set by God to restrain the violence of\r\nthe other.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York meeting was followed by one in Boston. In the spring of\r\n1871 the friends of peace met in the rooms of the New England Woman's\r\nClub, and formed an American Branch of the Women's International Peace\r\nAssociation: Julia Ward Howe, president. It took five meetings to\r\naccomplish this; the minutes of these meetings are curious and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nMr. Moncure D. Conway wrote objecting strongly to the movement being\r\nannounced as Christian: his objections were courteously considered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Howe gave her reasons for making her Appeal in the name of\r\nChristianity. She found the doctrine of peace and forgiveness of\r\ninjuries the most fundamental of the Christian doctrines. She thought it\r\nproper to say so, but did not by this prevent the believers in other\r\nreligions from asserting the same doctrine, if considered as existing in\r\nthose religions.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conway's objection was overruled.\r\n\r\nThe object of the association was \"to promote peace, by the study and\r\nculture of its conditions.\" A \"notice\" appended to the constitution\r\nannounced, \"This Association proposes to hold a World's Congress of\r\nWomen, in London, in the summer of 1872, in which undertaking the\r\ncooperation of all persons is earnestly invited.\"\r\n\r\nBefore continuing the story of this peace crusade, we return to the\r\nJournal. The volume for 1871 is fragmentary, the entries mostly brief\r\nand far apart. Written and blank pages are alike significant of the\r\nmovement going on in her mind, the steadily growing desire and resolve\r\nto dedicate her life, as her husband had dedicated his, to the highest\r\nneeds of humanity.\r\n\r\n\"_January 20._ Have been ill all these days. Had a divine glimpse this\r\nday, between daylight and dusk, of something like this--a beautiful\r\nperson splendidly dressed entering a theatre as I have often done with\r\nentire delight and forgetfulness of everything else, and the restraining\r\nhand of Christ holding me back in the outer darkness--the want and woe\r\nof the world, and saying, 'The true drama of life is _here_.' Oh! that\r\nrestraining hand had in it the true touch, communicating knowledge of\r\nhuman sorrow and zeal for human service. Never may I escape it to my\r\ngrave!\"[2]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I confess that I value more those processes of thought which explain\r\nhistory than those which arraign it. I would not therefore in my\r\nadvocacy of peace strip one laurel leaf from the graves so dear and\r\ntender in our recollection. Our brave men did and dared the best which\r\nthe time allowed. The sorrow for their loss was none the less brought\r\nupon us by those who believed in the military method. It is not in\r\ninjustice to them that I listen while the Angel of Charity says:\r\n'Behold, I show you a more excellent way.' Again, 'Come now, let us\r\nreason together, saith the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they\r\nshall be as wool.' This treating of injuries from the high ground of\r\nmagnanimity is the action that shall save the world.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The special faults of women are those incidental to a class that has\r\nnever been allowed to work out its ideal.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Must work to earn some money, but will not sacrifice greater ends to\r\nthis one.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Hear that the Greek mission is given to an editor in Troy, New York.\r\nSad for Greece and for Chev, who longs so to help her.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Civil liberty is that which the one cannot have without the many, or\r\nthe many without the one. The liberty of the State, like its solvency,\r\nconcerns and affects all its citizens. Equal sacredness of rights is its\r\npolitical side, equal stringency of duties its moral side. The virtue of\r\nsingle individuals will not give them civil liberty in a despotic state,\r\nbut the only safeguard of civil liberty to all is the virtue of each\r\nindividual.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You men by your vice and selfishness have created for women a hideous\r\nprofession, whose ranks you recruit from the unprotected, the innocent,\r\nthe ignorant.

We instruct your\r\nearly years. You keep instruction from our later ones.\r\n\r\n\"French popular authors have satirized American women freely. Let them\r\nremember that French literature has done much to corrupt American women.\r\nUnhappy Paris has corrupted the world. She is now swept from the face of\r\nthe earth.\"\r\n\r\nFrance was constantly in her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"The _morale_ of the _Commune_, that which has commended it to good\r\npeople, has undoubtedly been a supposed resistance to the return of\r\nabsolutism, which the Versailles Government was supposed covertly to\r\nrepresent.... No matter what advantage of reason the _Commune_ may have\r\nhad over the Versailles Government, the _Commune_ committed a civil\r\ncrime in attempting military enforcement of its political opinions. Such\r\nwas the crime which our South committed and which we resisted as one\r\ndefends one's own life. No overt military act of ours gave them the\r\nadvantage of a _casus belli_. They differed from us and determined to\r\ncoerce us forcibly. In that weltering mass of ruin and corruption which\r\nwas Paris, what lessons lie of the utter folly and futility of mutual\r\nmurder! What hearts of brothers estranged which time would have\r\nharmonized! What hecatombs of weltering corpses poisoning the earth\r\nwhich industry should make wholesome! What women demonized by passion,\r\nforgetting all their woman's lore and skill, the appointed givers of\r\nlife speeding death and reaping the bitter fruit themselves! With this\r\nterrible picture before us, let no civilized nation from henceforth and\r\nforever admit or recognize the instrumentality of war as worthy of\r\nChristian society. Let the fact of human brotherhood be taught to the\r\nbabe in his cradle, let it be taught to the despot on his throne. Let it\r\nbe the basis and foundation of education and legislation, the bond of\r\nhigh and low, of rich and poor....\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 27._ I am fifty-two years old this day and must regard this year\r\nas in some sense the best of my life. The great joy of the Peace Idea\r\nhas unfolded itself to me.... I have got at better methods of working\r\nin the practical matters at which I do work, and believe more than ever\r\nin patience, labor, and sticking to one's own idea of work. Study,\r\nbook-work, and solitary thinking and writing show us only one side of\r\nwhat we study. Practical life and intercourse with others supply the\r\nother side. If I may sit at work on this day next year, I hope that my\r\npeace matter will have assumed a practical and useful form, and that I\r\nmay have worked out my conception worthily.... I pray that neither Louis\r\nNapoleon nor the Bourbons may return to feed upon France, but that\r\nmerciful measures, surely of God's appointing, may heal her deadly\r\nwounds and uplift her prostrate heart. She must learn that the doctrine\r\nof self is irreligious. The _Commune_ surely knew this just as little as\r\ndid Louis Napoleon. I want to keep eyesight enough to read Greek and\r\nGerman, and my teeth for clear speaking and good digestion.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Paul says: 'Ye that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the\r\nweak,' but now we that are weak bear the infirmities of the strong.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Peace meeting at the Club. Read in Greek first part of the eighth\r\nchapter of Matthew; the account given of the centurion seems very\r\nstriking in the Greek. The contrast of his Western mind with the Eastern\r\nsubtleties of Jew and Greek seems to have struck Christ. He supposed\r\nChrist's power over unseen things to be like his own control over things\r\ncommitted to his authority. Then Christ began, perhaps, to see that the\r\nother nations of the world would profit by his work and doctrine before\r\nhis Jewish brethren.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"My first presidency at the New England Woman's Club....

It is something of a very definite and touching\r\ncharacter--all forgiving, all believing, making a decided religious\r\nimpression of its own--the heart so ripe, the intellectual part so\r\nlittle made out, like a fruit which might be all pulp and no fibre.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday we bring back the worn and dim currency of our active life to\r\nbe redeemed by the pure gold of the Supreme Wisdom.

Till we get out of self we are in the napkin.\r\nHospitable entertainment of other people's opinions, brotherly\r\npromotions of their interests--these acts make our five talents ten in\r\nuse to others and in enjoyment and profit to ourselves....\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ's teaching about marriage. Its tender and sacred reciprocity.\r\nAdultery among the Jews was only recognized as crime when committed by a\r\nwoman. The right of concubinage was too extensive to bring condemnation\r\nfor unchastity. The man might not steal another man's wife, but any\r\nwoman's husband might have intercourse with other women. Christ showed\r\nhow men did offend against this same law which worked so absolutely and\r\npartially against women. An unchaste thought in the breast of the man\r\ninfringed the high law of purity. This teaching of the tender mutual\r\nobligations of married life was probably new to many of his hearers.\r\n\r\n\"The present style of woman has really been fashioned by man, and is\r\nonly _quasi_ feminine.\r\n\r\n\"Peace meeting at Mystic, Connecticut.

She also hoped to found and foster \"a Woman's\r\nApostolate of Peace.\" These hopes were not then to be fulfilled: yet she\r\nalways felt that this visit, with all its labors and its\r\ndisappointments, was well worth while, and that much solid good came of\r\nit, to herself and to others.\r\n\r\nWe have seen her in London as a bride, enjoying to the full its gayeties\r\nand hospitality, as bright a vision as any that met her eyes, with a\r\ncompanion to whom all doors opened eagerly. This was the picture of\r\n1843; that of 1872 is different, indeed.\r\n\r\nA woman of middle age, quiet in dress and manner, with a serene and\r\nconstant dignity; a face in which the lines of thought and study were\r\ndeepening year by year; eyes now flashing with mirth, now tender with\r\nsympathy, always bright with the \"high resolve and hardihood\" for which,\r\nbut a few years before, she had been sighing: this was the woman who\r\ncame to London in 1872, alone and unaided; who, standing before the Dark\r\nTower of established Order and Precedent, might say with Childe\r\nRoland,--\r\n\r\n  \"Dauntless the slug horn to my lips I set,\r\n  And blew.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke at the banquet of the Unitarian Association. \"The occasion was\r\nto me a memorable one.\" She hired the Freemasons' Tavern and preached\r\nthere on five or six successive Sundays.\r\n\r\n\"My procedure was very simple,--a prayer, the reading of a hymn, and a\r\ndiscourse from a Scripture text.... The attendance was very good\r\nthroughout, and I cherished the hope that I had sown some seed which\r\nwould bear fruit hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nShe was asked to address meetings in various parts of England, speaking\r\nin Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Carlisle, with good\r\nacceptance. In Cambridge she talked with Professor J. R. Seeley, whom\r\nshe found most sympathetic. She was everywhere welcomed by thoughtful\r\npeople, old friends and new, whether or no they sympathized with her\r\nquest.\r\n\r\n\"_June 9._ My first preaching in London. Worked pretty much all day at\r\nsermon, intending, not to read, but to talk it--for me, a difficult\r\nprocedure. At 4.30 P.M. left off, but brain so tired that nothing in it.\r\nSubject, the kingdom of heaven.... Got a bad cup of tea--dressed (in my\r\nwell-worn black silk) and went to the Drawing-Room at Freemasons'\r\nTavern. God knows how I felt. 'Cast down but not forsaken.'... I got\r\nthrough better than I feared I might. Felt the method to be the right\r\none, speaking face to face and heart to heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 10._ Small beer going out of fashion leaves women one occupation\r\nthe less.

Let me enshrine this\r\ncharming and sincere word in my most precious recollection, from the man\r\nof sixty-three to the woman of fifty-three.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 27._ Left Leeds at 7 A.M., rising at 4.30....

But in the heartache he gave me, I\r\nresolved, God helping me, that my luxury shall henceforth be to minister\r\nto human misery, and to redeem much time and money spent on my own\r\nfancies, as I may....\"\r\n\r\nShe had been asked to attend two important meetings as American\r\ndelegate: a peace congress in Paris, and a great prison reform meeting\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nThe French meeting came first. She crossed the Channel, reaching Paris\r\nin time to attend the principal _séance_ of the congress. She presented\r\nher credentials, asked leave to speak, and was told \"with some\r\nembarrassment\" that she might speak to the officers of the society, when\r\nthe public meeting should be adjourned! She makes no comment on this\r\nproceeding, but says, \"I accordingly met a dozen or more of these\r\ngentlemen in a side room, where I simply spoke of my endeavors to enlist\r\nthe sympathies and efforts of women in behalf of the world's peace.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to London, she had \"the privilege of attending as a delegate\r\none of the great Prison Reform meetings of our day.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1843, Julia the bride would not have considered it a privilege to\r\nattend a meeting for prison reform. She would have shrugged her\r\nshoulders, would perhaps have pouted because the Chevalier cared more\r\nfor these things than for the opera, with Grisi, Mario, and Lablache:\r\nshe might even have written some funny verses about the windmill-tilting\r\nof her Don Quixote. Now, she stood in the place that failing health\r\nforbade him to fill, with a depth of interest, an earnestness of\r\npurpose, equal to his own. She, too, now heard the sorrowful sighing of\r\nthe prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt one of the meetings of this congress, a jailer of the old school\r\nspoke in defence of the system of flogging refractory prisoners, and\r\ndescribed in brutal fashion a brutal incident. Her blood was on fire:\r\nshe asked leave to speak.\r\n\r\n\"It is related,\" she said, \"of the famous Beau Brummel that a gentleman\r\nwho called upon him one morning met a valet carrying away a tray of\r\nneck-cloths, more or less disordered. 'What are these?' asked the\r\nvisitor; and the servant replied, 'These are our failures!' When I see\r\nthe dark coach which in our country carries the criminal to his place of\r\ndetention, I say, 'Society, here are your failures.'\"\r\n\r\nHer words were loudly applauded, and the punishment was voted down.\r\n\r\nThe Journal gives her further speech on this occasion: \"Spoke of justice\r\nto women. They had talked of fallen women. I prayed them to leave that\r\nhopeless phrase. Every fallen woman represents a man as guilty as\r\nherself, who escapes human detection, but whose soul lies open before\r\nGod. Speak of vicious, dissolute women, but don't speak of fallen women\r\nunless you recognize the fall of man, the old doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days before this she had preached her last sermon in London. The\r\nJournal says: \"All Sunday at work upon my sermon, the last in London.\r\n'Neither height nor depth, nor any other creature.' The sermon of high\r\nand low, and the great unity beyond all dimensions. A good and to me a\r\nmost happy delivery of opinions and faith which I deeply hold.... So\r\nended my happy ministration in London, begun in fear and anxiety, ended\r\nin certainty and renewed faith, which God continue to me.\"\r\n\r\nAugust found her back at Oak Glen, exhausted in body and mind. She is\r\nalmost too tired to write in the Journal, and such entries as there are\r\nonly accentuate her fatigue.\r\n\r\n\"I am here at my table with books and papers, but feel very languid. My\r\narms feel as if there were no marrow in their bones. I suppose this is\r\nreaction after so much work, but unless I can get up strength somehow I\r\nshall not accomplish anything. Weakness in all my limbs. Have had my\r\nGreek lesson and begun to read the Maccabees and the Apocrypha. I shall\r\nprobably come up after a few days, but feel at present utterly incapable\r\nof exertion. I must help Maud--have helped her with music to-day....\"\r\n\r\n\"Walked about with dear Chev, whose talk is always instructive. Every\r\nbreak in our long-continued habits shows us something to amend in our\r\npast lives. What do I see in mine after this long break? That I must\r\nendeavor to have more real life and more religion. The passive and\r\ncontemplative following of thought, my own or other people's, must not\r\nde-energize my sympathies and my will. I must daily consult the divine\r\nwill and standard which can help us to mould our lives aright without\r\nrunning from one extreme to another. My heart's wish would now be to\r\ndevote myself to some sort of religious ministration. God can open a way\r\nfor this in which the spirit of my desire may receive the form of his\r\nwill. I must lecture this winter to earn some money and spread, I hope,\r\nsome good doctrine....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch was the beginning of her work for peace, which was to end only with\r\nher life. Disappointed in her hope of a world congress, she turned the\r\ncurrent of her effort in a new direction. She would have a festival, a\r\nday which should be called Mothers' Day, and be devoted to the advocacy\r\nof peace doctrines. She chose the second day of June; for many years she\r\nand her friends and followers kept this day religiously, with sweet and\r\ntender observances which were unspeakably dear to her.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 there was a great peace meeting in Philadelphia. The occasion is\r\nthus described by the Reverend Ada C. Bowles: \"There were delegates from\r\nFrance, Italy, and Germany, each with a burning desire to be heard, and\r\nall worth hearing, but none able to speak English. The audience looked\r\nto the anxious face of the President with sympathy; then a voice was\r\nheard, 'Call for Mrs. Howe.' Those present will never forget how her\r\npresence changed the meeting from a threatened failure to a noble\r\nsuccess. The German, Frenchman, and Italian stood in turn by her side.\r\nAt the proper moment she lifted a finger, and then gave in her perfect\r\nEnglish each speech in full to the delight of the delegates and the\r\nadmiration of all.\"\r\n\r\nThe last celebration of her Mothers' Day was held in Riverton, New\r\nJersey, on June 1, 1912, by the Pennsylvania Peace Society, in\r\nconjunction with the Universal Peace Union. On the printed invitation to\r\nthis festival we read\r\n\r\n  \"Aid it, paper, aid it, pen,\r\n  Aid it, hearts of earnest men.\r\n\r\n                  \"Julia Ward Howe, 1874.\"\r\n\r\nAnd further on, \"Thirty-nine years ago Julia Ward Howe instituted this\r\nfestival for peace,--a time for the women and children to come together;\r\nto meet in the country, invite the public, and recite, speak, sing and\r\npray for 'those things that make for peace.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSANTO DOMINGO\r\n\r\n1872-1874; _aet._ 53-56\r\n\r\nA PARABLE\r\n\r\n  \"I sent a child of mine to-day;\r\n    I hope you used him well.\"\r\n  \"Now, Lord, no visitor of yours\r\n    Has waited at my bell.\r\n\r\n  \"The children of the Millionnaire\r\n    Run up and down our street;\r\n  I glory in their well-combed hair,\r\n    Their dress and trim complete.\r\n\r\n  \"But yours would in a chariot come\r\n    With thoroughbreds so gay;\r\n  And little merry maids and men\r\n    To cheer him on his way.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Stood, then, no child before your door?\"\r\n    The Lord, persistent, said.\r\n  \"Only a ragged beggar-boy,\r\n    With rough and frowzy head.\r\n\r\n  \"The dirt was crusted on his skin,\r\n    His muddy feet were bare;\r\n  The cook gave victuals from within;\r\n    I cursed his coming there.\"\r\n\r\n  What sorrow, silvered with a smile,\r\n    Slides o'er the face divine?\r\n  What tenderest whisper thrills rebuke?\r\n    \"The beggar-boy was mine!\"\r\n\r\n                                    J. W. H.\r\n\r\nWe must go back a little to tell another story.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1870-71 the Republic of Santo Domingo sent through its\r\npresident an urgent request for annexation to the United States.\r\nPresident Grant appointed a commission to visit this island republic,\r\nto inquire into its conditions and report upon the question. Of this\r\ncommission Dr. Howe was one, the others being Messrs. Benjamin Wade and\r\nAndrew D. White.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners sailed on the government steamer Tennessee. At parting\r\nthe Doctor said, \"Remember that you cannot hear from us under a month;\r\nso do not be frightened at our long silence.\"\r\n\r\nA week later came reports of a severe storm in the Southern seas. A\r\nlarge steamer had been seen struggling with wind and wave, apparently at\r\ntheir mercy. Some newspaper thought it might be the Tennessee. All the\r\nnewspapers took up the cry: it probably _was_ the Tennessee; most likely\r\nshe had foundered and gone down with all on board.\r\n\r\nMindful of the Doctor's warning, our mother tried to disregard these\r\nvoices of terror. She went quietly about her work as usual, but none the\r\nless the days of suspense that followed were \"dark indeed and hard to\r\nlive through.\"[72]\r\n\r\n  [72] _Reminiscences_, p. 346.\r\n\r\nWe remember these days well, the resolute cheerfulness, the avoidance of\r\noutward sign of anxiety, the sudden lifting of the cloud when the good\r\nnews came of the steamer's safe arrival.\r\n\r\nThe prayer of Santo Domingo was not to be answered, spite of the\r\nfavorable report of the commission: but the Doctor had been so delighted\r\nwith the island that when, a year later, he was asked to visit it in the\r\ninterests of the Samana Bay Company, he gladly accepted the commission.\r\n\r\nThis time our mother went with him, together with Maud and a party of\r\nfriends. She had been loth to go, for she had already planned her peace\r\ncrusade in England, but finding how much he desired it, she compromised\r\non part of the time.\r\n\r\nThey sailed from New York early in February, 1872, in the steamer Tybee.\r\nThe voyage was rough and stormy. The companion daughter of the time\r\nremembers how the wretched little Tybee pitched and heaved; even more\r\nvividly she recalls the way in which our mother from the first made\r\nsociety out of the strangely assorted company on board. She was the\r\nmagnet, and drew them all to her: the group of conventional ladies who\r\nhad never before been at sea, the knot of naval officers going to join\r\ntheir ship,--among them George W. De Long, the hero of the ill-fated\r\nJeannette expedition; a colonel, and a judge, the former interested in\r\nthe Samana Bay Company. She made out of this odd company and the gruff\r\nold captain a sort of court which she ruled in a curious way. She did\r\nnot seem to compel their admiration so much as to compel each to give\r\nhis best.\r\n\r\nThe Tybee cast anchor in the harbor of Puerto Plata, and the voyagers\r\nsaw Mont Isabel towering above them, its foot in the clear beryl water\r\nwhere the palms grew down to the very edge of the yellow sea sand, its\r\nhead wrapped in the clouds. The Doctor came to the stateroom, crying,\r\n\"Come up and see the great glory!\"\r\n\r\nOur mother's delight can be imagined when they sailed into the harbor of\r\nSanto Domingo and landed near an immense and immemorial tree, where,\r\nthey were told, Columbus had landed.\r\n\r\nThe party lodged in a fine old Spanish _palacio_, built round a\r\ncourtyard. It had been originally a convent. The nuns were gone, and\r\ntheir place was now taken by the gay company of American ladies, who\r\npossibly gave the sleepy little city more new ideas than it had ever\r\nreceived in so short a space of time. President Baez put the palace at\r\nthe Doctor's disposal; he was an important person to the President and\r\nto the Dominicans, for at that time the hope of annexation had not died\r\nout. All the party were treated with extraordinary courtesy. Not only\r\nwere they given the presidential palace to live in, but a guard of honor\r\nwas kept in the courtyard. Their horses were lodged, Spanish fashion, on\r\nthe ground floor. The trampling, the neighing, and the fleas made them\r\nrather uncomfortable neighbors. Our mother soon found out that the only\r\nway she could see the country, or enjoy its life, was by riding. At\r\nfirst she was a little nervous, but she soon regained her courage and\r\nher seat. This was her first riding since the days of Cora, the wicked\r\nlittle mare, when she read her Bible and said her prayers before every\r\nride. She thus describes it:--\r\n\r\n\"In Santo Domingo, nothing is more charming than the afternoon ride. It\r\nis, of course, the great event of the neighborhood. Our cavalcade\r\nusually numbers four or five ladies. Sometimes we cross the river in a\r\nflat-bottomed boat, which is pulled over by a rope stretched and made\r\nfast at either end. We then visit the little village of Pajarita, and\r\ntrot along under the shade of heavy mango trees. Or we explore the\r\ncountry on this side the river. The great thing to guard against is the\r\ndanger of rain. This we encountered one afternoon in some severity.\r\nSuddenly one of the party cried '_Llava!_' and down came the waters. We\r\nwere somewhat heated with our ride, and the penetrating rain fell chill\r\nupon us. A large tree gave us shelter for a few moments, but we were\r\nsoon forced to seek more effectual protection. This we found, after some\r\ndelay, in a _boio_, or hut, into which horses and riders were dragged\r\npell-mell. The night was closing in, the Chief at home, and presumably\r\nanxious, the rain unabating. Which of the tropical spasms would end our\r\nfar-spent life? Would it be lockjaw, a common result of severe chill in\r\nthese regions? Would it be a burning, delirious fever with a touch of\r\nyellow; or should we get off with croup and diphtheria?\r\n\r\n\"The rain presently stopped, and we returned to the saddle, and then, by\r\neasy stages, to the city. On reaching home, we were advised to bathe the\r\nchilled surfaces with rum, not the wicked New England article, but the\r\nmilder product of the country. Of all the evil consequences spoken of as\r\nsure to follow such an exposure, fever, lockjaw, and sore throat, we\r\nhave so far not seen the earliest symptom.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Carnival. All the cabinet officers and their wives devoted\r\nthemselves to the entertainment of the party. The Minister of War, Señor\r\nCuriel, a little twinkling fiery man, devoted himself especially to our\r\nmother, and was her right hand in the many expeditions she arranged. The\r\nSecretary of State, Señor Gautier, a grave person with more culture\r\nthan most of the Dominicans, was the Doctor's chosen friend. To return\r\nthe many attentions showered upon them, a ball in the old convent was\r\narranged. The Doctor once said to her, \"If you were on a desert island\r\nwith nobody there but one old darkey, you would give a party.\" (But it\r\nwas from Cuba that he wrote, \"Julia knows three words of Spanish, and is\r\nconstantly engaged in active conversation.\")\r\n\r\nTo find herself at Carnival, the leader of a gay party, living in a\r\nspacious palace, supported by the guns and the officers of an American\r\nwarship (the Narragansett, with De Long and other officers on board),\r\nwas an opportunity not to be missed. She thus describes the\r\nentertainment:--\r\n\r\n\"_Hans Breitmann gife a barty._\r\n\r\n\"So did we. To see Santo Domingo was little, without seeing the\r\nDominicans also. Some diplomatic overtures were made. Would the first\r\nfamilies come and pass an evening with us at the _Palacio_? Yes, they\r\nwould. Which _were_ the first families? That would have been for us a\r\npoint very difficult to determine. The family of the President and those\r\nof the heads of departments would certainly stand in that prominence.\r\nFor the necessary beaux we were referred to a society recently\r\nestablished here, calling itself '_La Juventad_,' 'the young people.'\r\nThis body of philanthropists, being appealed to, consented to undertake\r\nthe management of our party. The occasion was announced as a\r\n_bailecita_, 'little ball.' We asked them to provide such refreshments\r\nas are customary in this place. Thirty dollars' worth of sweet cake and\r\na bottled ocean of weak beer formed the principal items of the bill, as\r\nbrought to us. The friends came at 5 P.M., to decorate the room with\r\nflowers, also to arrange two tables, on one of which _las dulces_ were\r\narrayed, while the other was made to display a suspicious-looking group\r\nof glasses. A band, we were told, would be indispensable. We demurred at\r\nthis, having intended to musicate upon our own grand piano. Hearing,\r\nhowever, that the band could be had for the sum of twelve dollars, we\r\ngave in on this point.\r\n\r\n\"One long room runs the whole length of one side of the palace, and\r\nserves us at once for dining and reception room. A long corridor\r\nencounters this room at right angles, entirely open to the weather, on\r\none side. These two spaces constitute all our resources for receiving\r\ncompany. We lit them with Downer's best [kerosene] and ranged rows of\r\nrocking-chairs, opposite to each other, after the manner of this\r\ncountry, and also of Cuba.\r\n\r\n\"The company began to arrive at 8 P.M. The young ladies were mostly\r\nattired in colored tarlatans, prettily trimmed with lace and flowers.\r\nSome of them were not over fourteen years of age. All were quite\r\nyouthful in their appearance, and unaffected in their manners. The young\r\nmen, mostly employed in the various shops of the city, were well-dressed\r\nand polite. The band was somewhat barbaric in its aspect. A violin, a\r\n'cello, a tambourine, and a clarinet. The clarinet-player was of\r\nuncommon size, with wild, dark eyes, which seemed to dilate as he\r\nplayed....\r\n\r\n\"The dancing continued with little interruption until nearly 2 A.M. We\r\nwere told that it is often continued till daylight. From time to time an\r\nattack was made upon the two tables. But the enjoyment of the good\r\nthings provided was quite moderate compared with the cramming of a\r\nfirst-class party in Boston or New York. The guests were of many shades,\r\nas to color, although the greater number would have passed for white\r\npeople, anywhere. Some of the handsomest among them were very dark. One\r\nyoung man reminded us of Edwin Booth in \"Othello.\"... None of these\r\npeople look like the mulattoes in the North. The features and the fibre\r\nappear finer, and the jet-black hair often suggests an admixture of\r\nIndian blood. The difference of social position shows itself in the\r\nmanners of these people. The cruel colorphobia has never proscribed\r\nthem. They have no artificial sense of inferiority, but take themselves\r\nas God made them, and think that if He is content with their\r\ncomplexions, mankind at large may be so.\r\n\r\n\"We were much pleased with our party, and with the simple and unaffected\r\ngayety of our guests. It was really a party in the open air, one whole\r\nside of our ballroom being unenclosed, save by the infrequent colonnade.\r\nWe looked from the dancers to the stars, and back again to the dancers.\r\nIt was all fairylike and dreamlike. The favorite '_dansa_' much\r\nresembles, not a ballet, but a stage dance, such as is introduced in the\r\ncourse of the drama. The beer flowed, and the couples flew. One\r\ninnovation we introduced, a Virginia reel, which the clever\r\nclarinet-player caught and accompanied. The figures much amazed the\r\nnatives. The _dénouement_ of Mr. Leland's classic ballad was wanting. No\r\n\r\n  \"'Gompany fited mit daple lecks\r\n  Till de coonshtable made em shtop';\r\n\r\nyet we may quote further from that high source:--\r\n\r\n  \"'Hans Breitmann gife a barty,\r\n  Where ish that barty now?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  All goned afay mit der lager pier,\r\n  Afay in der Ewigkeit!'\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal gives pleasant glimpses of the Santo Domingo days.\r\n\r\n\"M. Marne, a Frenchman ninety-seven years old, paid us a visit. Had been\r\nsecretary of Joseph Buonaparte in Madrid--praised him much. Talked very\r\ncopiously and not ill. Enjoys full mental and physical activity. Lives\r\nat a small village in sight of our windows, but on the other side of the\r\nriver. Talked much of the Roi Cristophe.\"\r\n\r\nThe mention of this old gentleman recalls her visit to a Dominican\r\n_padre_, himself in extreme age, who told her that he had known a\r\nnegress who lived to the age of one hundred and forty-three; he had\r\nconfessed and buried her. \"She had her teeth and her hair still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to market to-day, but breakfast early--then all hands to the\r\ncathedral to see the high mass performed--to-day in honor of the\r\nindependence of the island....\r\n\r\n\"Baez' face, cunning, pretty strong, _enjoué_, as if he must be, or\r\nseem, a _bon enfant_.... The noise at the elevation of the Host a\r\nperfect Babel. Music, 'Ernani,' 'Fra Diavolo,' with some similar things.\r\nA single trumpet shrieked at some high moments. The bells rang like a\r\nthousand tin pans. Orchestra and chorus not together and both out of\r\ntune. The ceremony otherwise perhaps as well as usual. A priest made a\r\nbrief address in Spanish, praising the day and complimenting the\r\nPresident....\"\r\n\r\n\"Studied Baur, Aristophanes, and '_Etudes sur la Bible_.' Music lesson\r\nto Maud. O'Sullivan to dine.... Baez sent word that he would visit us\r\nbetween 5 and 6 P.M. We accordingly put things in the best order\r\npossible under the circumstances. _Ung puo de tualetta_ for the ladies\r\nseemed proper. At dinner received Baez' card with a great dish of fine\r\nsapotes. Baez arrived. He speaks French quite tolerably, is affable, and\r\nhas an intelligent face; in fact looks like a person of marked talent.\r\nWe talked of things in the United States. He has made fourteen voyages\r\nto Europe.... I sang '_Una Barchetta_' for him. He came with one\r\nservant, who stayed outside--no ceremony and no escort....\"\r\n\r\nAfter the beauty of the place--indeed possibly before it--she valued the\r\nopportunity that came to her of preaching. On the voyage to Santo\r\nDomingo she had learned of a shepherdless flock of colored Protestants,\r\ntheir minister dead, their \"elder\" disabled by lameness. Here was an\r\nopportunity not to be lost. She engaged to hold Sunday evening services\r\nin their church, a small wooden building with a mud floor and a mahogany\r\npulpit. The \"Reminiscences\" describe these services; the tattered\r\nhymn-books whose leaves were turned mechanically while the congregation\r\n(few of whom could read) sang with a will the hymns they knew by heart;\r\nthe humble, devout people with their attentive faces.\r\n\r\nWhen Holy Week came, the congregation begged her to hold special\r\nservices. They wished their young people to understand that these sacred\r\ndays meant as much to them as to the surrounding Catholics. Accordingly\r\nshe and her companion \"dressed the little church with flowers. It looked\r\ncharmingly. Flowers all along the railing [here follows in the Journal a\r\npen-and-ink sketch], flowers in the pulpit over my head. Church was\r\ncrowded. Many people outside and at the windows.\"\r\n\r\nShe always remembered with pleasure one feature of her Easter sermon,\r\nher attempt to describe Dante's vision of a great cross in the heavens,\r\nformed of star clusters, each cluster bearing the name of Christ. \"The\r\nthought,\" she says, \"that the mighty poet of the fourteenth century\r\nshould have something to impart to these illiterate negroes was very\r\ndear to me.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the party has an undying impression of this Easter service: the\r\nshabby little chapel crowded with dark faces, and the preacher, standing\r\ntouched by a ray of sunlight, speaking to that congregation of simple\r\nblack people. In her notes she speaks of these services.\r\n\r\n\"A pastoral charge bringing me near to the hearts and sympathies of the\r\npeople. I have preached five times in the little church, including Good\r\nFriday and Easter Monday. This service, which has not been without its\r\ndifficulties, is so much better to me in remembrance than anything else\r\nI have done here that I must make a little break and pause before I\r\nspeak of other things.\r\n\r\n\"In this pause I remember my prayer at Puerto Plata, that I and mine\r\nmight come to this new region with a reverent and teachable spirit. That\r\nprayer was an earnest one to me. I hope it has, as all prayers should,\r\naccomplished its own fulfilment. I have been here among dear people. I\r\nfind all the human varieties in this society, not digested and\r\nharmonized by noble culture, but existing and asking for the\r\ncentralizing and discriminating agencies which in civilization sort out\r\nthe different tastes, characters, and capacities, and assign to each its\r\ntask, giving devotion its wings and crime its treadmill. This little\r\npopulation in a great country, a country in which Nature allows no one\r\nto starve, has lived and so shown its right to live and maintain itself.\r\nIt has accomplished its political division from a state antipathetic to\r\nit, having its dark face turned fixedly towards barbarism [Hayti].\r\n\r\n\"I stood in a little church in the city and island of Santo Domingo, to\r\npreach the glad tidings of the gospel of Peace. It was a humble little\r\ntemple, with a mud floor, and plastered walls, and a roof which scarcely\r\nkept out the rain, but it was a place full of comfort to me and to\r\nothers. The seats and spaces were all filled, for it had no aisles. The\r\nsmall windows and doors were cushioned, so to speak, with human\r\ncountenances, wearing an expression of curiosity or attention. The way\r\nto the church was lined on both sides with the simple people, who held\r\ntheir service at night because the poverty of their attire made them\r\nashamed to hold it by day. And this crowd came together, Sunday after\r\nSunday, because a woman from a distant country stood in that little\r\nchurch to tell them what a woman can tell about the kingdom of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nLoth as she had been to go to Santo Domingo, she was far more loth to\r\nleave it; but the time appointed for her peace crusade in London was at\r\nhand, and she could tarry no longer. On April 5 she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my time is nearly out. Dear Santo Domingo, how I do love you, with\r\nyour childish life, and your ancestral streets--a grandam and a babe!\r\nTo-day I read my last in Baur and Greek for some time, probably, as must\r\npack to-morrow. As at present advised, God grant that we may come here\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 6._ Here to-day and gone to-morrow, literally. Mostly\r\npacked--have left out my books for a last sweet morsel.... Did not get\r\nthat sweet morsel. Was busy all day--farewell calls from friends, little\r\ntalks, and the fear of sitting down and forgetting my preparations in my\r\nbooks. In the evening the Gautiers came and I played for them to dance.\r\nSo, one last little gayety in common.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday, April 7._ Got up at 4 A.M. Dressed and got off pretty\r\neasily.... The parting from Maud was very hard. Oh! when the line was\r\ndrawn in, and my darling and I were fairly sundered, my old heart gave\r\nway, and I cried bitterly....\r\n\r\n\"Henry Blackwell is a dear, comforting man, most kind and companionable.\r\nA woman on board with a wretched baby of six months, he in a muslin\r\ngown and nothing else, crying with cold. I got out a cotton flannel\r\ndressing-sack, and wrapped him up in it and tended him a good deal....\r\n\r\n\"May the purpose for which I undertake this painful and solitary journey\r\nbe ever strong enough in my thoughts to render every step of it pure,\r\nblameless and worthy. Great God, do not let me desert thee! For that is\r\nthe trouble. Thou dost not desert us. I dread unspeakably these dark\r\ndays of suffering and confusion. To go is like being hanged....\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain said something about my preaching on Sunday, so I have been\r\nlaying out some points for a sermon.... But it is not very likely that\r\nthe Captain will really ask me to hold service.\r\n\r\n\"Talk with purser about Homer. He has a vivacious mind, and might easily\r\nlearn Greek, or anything else he would have a mind to.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday._ It turned out that the Captain and passengers did wish me to\r\nhold a little service to-day, so at 10.30 A.M. I met them in the\r\ndining-saloon. I had a Bible, from which I read the 116th Psalm--a\r\nprayer followed--then the missionary hymn, 'From Greenland's icy\r\nmountains'--then my little sermon, of which I have the headings. I am so\r\nvery glad to have been able and enabled to do this.\r\n\r\n\"Began to teach the purser to read from notes with a leaf of music out\r\nof some periodical. Copied Baur a little--talked and heard much talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 17...._ Expect to get in to-morrow, not very late, unless\r\nanother contrary gale. Frigate birds and petrels yesterday--to-day,\r\nwhales, blackfish, and an immense number of porpoises. Revelation cannot\r\ngo beyond human consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"The Western mind has taken Christ's metaphorical illustrations\r\nliterally, and his literal moral precepts metaphorically.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 18...._ Very thankful to have got through so well so far.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs at the beginning of this chapter we took a step backward, so we must\r\nnow take one forward and speak briefly of the second visit to Santo\r\nDomingo in 1874.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor's health was failing; he had suffered from the winter's cold,\r\nand longed for the warm sunshine of the beloved island. Would she go\r\nwith him? he asked. She should preach to her colored folks as much as\r\nshe liked.\r\n\r\nThey sailed together in the Tybee in March. After a brief visit to the\r\ncapital (where Revolution had been before them, expelling the friendly\r\nBaez, and putting in his place a man opposed to the Samana Bay Company),\r\nthey took up their quarters at Samana, in a little hillside cottage\r\nabout a mile from the town.\r\n\r\nOur mother writes in her Journal:--\r\n\r\n\"_March 20._ In Santo Domingo as glad as a child.... Went to Garcia's\r\nand foolishly bargained for the gold necklace and emerald ring I fancied\r\nthe last time I was here. The necklace is for Maud.\"\r\n\r\nThe love of jewelry was one of the \"little passions\" of her whole life.\r\nSpeaking once of this as her \"besetting sin,\" she said: \"It is rather\r\nrespectable to have a besetting sin, as it shows one must have had an\r\nancestor from whom it was inherited!\" She enjoyed a jewel as she did a\r\nflower or a song: she loved to deck her dear ones and herself with\r\ntrinkets; a jeweller's window was a thing of delight to her, not to be\r\npassed without the tribute of a pause and a glance at its treasures. Yet\r\na purchase of this kind seldom failed to bring its retributive pang the\r\nday after.\r\n\r\n\"Was sorry to have made so foolish a use of the money. Resolve never to\r\ndo so again, unless some new light should make it seem right. God will\r\nnot have my mind occupied with such nonsense.... Have written my sermon\r\nfor to-morrow evening.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent two months in Samana in almost absolute retirement. The\r\nDoctor read \"Don Quixote\" in Spanish, she Aristotle in Greek and Baur in\r\nGerman. The former \"was early and late in the saddle, and dashed up and\r\ndown the steep hillsides of Samana with all his old fearlessness.\" The\r\nlatter followed as she might, \"in perils and dangers, in terrors often.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had never been a bold rider, and I must confess that I suffered\r\nagonies of fear in following him on these expeditions. If I lagged\r\nbehind, he would cry, 'Come on! it's as bad as going to a funeral to\r\nride with you.' And so, I suppose, it was. I remember one day when a\r\ngreat palm branch had fallen across our path. I thought that my horse\r\nwould certainly slip on it, sending me to the depths below. That very\r\nday, while Dr. Howe took his siesta, I went to the place where this\r\nimpediment lay, and with a great effort threw it over the steep\r\nmountain-side. The whole neighborhood of Samana is very mountainous,\r\nand I sometimes found it impossible to obey the word of command. One day\r\nmy husband spurred his horse and made a gallant dash at a very steep\r\nascent, ordering me to follow him. I tried my best, but only got far\r\nenough to find myself awkwardly at a standstill, and unable to go either\r\nbackward or forward. The Doctor was obliged to dismount and to lead my\r\nhorse down to the level ground. This, he assured me, was a severe\r\nmortification for him.\"[73]\r\n\r\n  [73] _Reminiscences_, p. 362.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the permission given, she spoke only a few times in Samana.\r\nShe tells of an open-air service in which she took part. She arrived\r\nlate, and found a zealous elder holding forth and \"reading\" from a Bible\r\nheld upside down. At sight of her he said, \"And now dat de lady hab\r\ncome, I will obdunk from de place!\"\r\n\r\nOne day she spoke to the pupils of a little school kept by an English\r\ncarpenter, who studied Greek in order to understand the New Testament,\r\nyet allowed his pupils to use the small _i_ for the personal pronoun.\r\nThe schoolhouse was perched on a hill so steep that she was thankful to\r\nmount astride on a huge white steer furnished with a straw saddle, and\r\nbe led up by a friendly neighbor.\r\n\r\nIn these days the ill-fated Samana Bay Company, of which the Doctor and\r\nmany others had had high hopes, came to an end, and the Dominican\r\nGovernment insisted that its flag should be officially withdrawn. Our\r\nmother describes the incident:--\r\n\r\n\"To town early to be present at the taking down of the Samana Company's\r\nflag by the commission sent on board the Dominican war schooner. I went\r\nin the boat and found Chev in the custom-house with the commission\r\nseated around. A good many of our people present. Chev read his protest,\r\nwhich was strong and simple.... We then went out of the building; the\r\n_employés_ of our Company marched up in their best clothes, their hats\r\nstuck full of roses, and stood in order on either side the flagstaff.\r\nThe man ordered by the commission lowered the flag. Just before, Chev\r\ngot our people to stand in a circle around him, made a lovely little\r\naddress. The old Crusader never appeared nobler or better than on this\r\noccasion, when his beautiful chivalry stood in the greatest contrast to\r\nthe barbarism and ingratitude which dictated this act. My mind was full\r\nof cursing rather than blessing. Yet finding myself presently alone with\r\nthe superseded flag I laid my hand upon it and prayed that if I had\r\npower to bless anything, my prayers might bless the good effort which\r\nhas been made here.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 2 she adds: \"The blacks here say that the taking down of our\r\nflag was like the crucifixion of our Lord. We are assured that they\r\nwould have offered forcible resistance, if we had authorized their so\r\ndoing.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 9._ The last day of our last week in Samana.... God knows when I\r\nshall have so much restful leisure again. My rides on horseback, too,\r\nare ended for the present, though I may mount once more to-day or\r\nto-morrow. All these pleasures have been mixed with pains--my fear on\r\nhorseback ... but far more than all, my anxiety about the dearest ones\r\nat home. The affairs of the Company, too, have given me many sad\r\nthoughts, but in spite of all this the time has been a blessed one. I\r\nhave improved in mind and body, if not in estate--have had sweet leisure\r\nfor thought and study, opportunity to preach the gospel (three times),\r\nand most invigorating air and exercise. Over the door of the little\r\nparlor here hangs a motto: 'God bless our Home.' I think, indeed, He has\r\nblessed this little home, though, at first, when I looked at the motto,\r\nI always thought of my own home.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day they saw the \"last of beautiful Samana for the present,\"\r\nand ten days later found them in New York. Her final word on this brief\r\nand lovely episode is given in the Journal for May 24: \"My heart sinks\r\nwhenever Chev says he will never go to Samana again. 'There are my young\r\nbarbarians all at play.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF GREEN PEACE\r\n\r\n1872-1876; _aet._ 53-57\r\n\r\n  He who launched thee a bolt of fire\r\n  Strong in courage and in desire\r\n  Takes thee again a weapon true\r\n  In heaven's armory ever new.\r\n\r\n  Still shall the masterful fight go on,\r\n  Still shall the battle of Right be won\r\n  And He who fixed thee in upper air\r\n  Shall carry thy prowess otherwhere.\r\n\r\n                                        J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our father's health failed more and more, his heart turned to the\r\nhome he had made. He longed for Green Peace; and--the lease falling in\r\nabout this time--in the spring of 1872 he and our mother and Maud moved\r\nthither, and took up their quarters in the \"new part,\" while Laura and\r\nher husband came to occupy the old. Here the first grandchild (Alice\r\nMaud Richards) was born; here and at Oak Glen the next four years were\r\nmainly passed.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor's ardent spirit longed for new fields of work, new causes to\r\nhelp; the earthly part could not follow. How he struggled, toiling,\r\nsuffering, fighting the good fight to his last breath, has been told\r\nelsewhere:[74] suffice it to say that these years were grave ones for\r\nthe household, spite of new joys that dawned for all.\r\n\r\n  [74] _Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe._\r\n\r\nThe grandchildren opened a new world for both our parents: a world which\r\none was to enjoy for a space all too brief, the other through long\r\nyears, in which she was to be to the youngest generation a lamp of\r\nwisdom, a flame of warmth and tenderness, a fountain of joy.\r\n\r\nAmong the memory pictures of this time is one of her sitting at her\r\ndesk, laboring at her endless correspondence; beside her, on the floor,\r\nthe baby of the period, equally absorbed in the contents of the\r\nwaste-paper basket.\r\n\r\nOr we see the tall figure of the Doctor, stooping in the doorway between\r\nthe two houses, a crowing child on his shoulders, old face and young\r\nalight with merriment. These were Richards grandbabes; the Hall children\r\nwere the summer delight of the grandparents, as they and their mother\r\nusually spent the summer at Oak Glen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Friday, September 13._ Before I open even my New Testament to-day, I\r\nmust make record of the joyful birth of Flossy's little son [Samuel\r\nPrescott Hall].... God bless this dear little child! May he bring peace\r\nand love....\r\n\r\n\"During the confinement I could not think of anything divine or\r\nspiritual. It was Nature's grim, mechanical, traditional task. But now\r\nthat it is over, my heart remembers that Life is not precious without\r\nGod, and the living soul just given stands related to the quickening\r\nspirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"...I can get little time for study, as I must help nurse dear Flossy.\r\nMy mind is strangely divided between my dear work and my dear child and\r\ngrandchild. I must try to keep along with both, but on no account to\r\nneglect the precious grandchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 1._ O year! thou art running low. The last trimester.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 2._ This day, thirty-two years ago, my dearest brother Henry\r\ndied in my arms, the most agonizing experience. Never again did Death so\r\nenter into my heart, until my lovely son of three years departed many\r\nyears later, leaving a blank as sad and bitter. Henry was a rare and\r\ndelicate person.... His life was a most valuable one to us for help and\r\ncounsel, as well as for affection. Perhaps no one to-day thinks about\r\nhis death except me, his junior by two years, wearing now into the\r\ndecline of life. Dear brother, I look forward to the reunion with you,\r\nbut wish my record were whiter and brighter.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 5._ Boston. Came up for directors' meeting of New England\r\nWoman's Club. Went afterward to Mrs. Cheney's lecture on English\r\nliterature.... A suggestive and interesting essay, which I was glad to\r\nhear and have others hear. It gave me a little pain, that, though she\r\npleasantly alluded to me as one who has laid aside the laurel for the\r\nolive branch, she said nothing whatever about my writings, which deserve\r\nto be spoken of in characterizing the current literature of the day; but\r\nshe perhaps does not read or like my works, and besides, people think of\r\nme nowadays more as an active woman's woman than as a literary\r\ncharacter, as the phrase is. All life is full of trial, and when I hear\r\nliterary performance praised, and remember my own love for it, and for\r\npraise, I think a little how much of all this I have sacrificed in these\r\nlater years for a service that has made me enemies as well as friends. I\r\nfelt called upon to do this, and I still think that if I made a mistake,\r\nit was one of those honest mistakes it is best to make.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe was giving Maud music lessons this autumn, reading Plutarch with\r\nher, taking her to parties and giving parties for her. Later, we find\r\nher holding mission services at Vineyard Haven; addressing the Saturday\r\nMorning Club (\"Subject--_Object_: I smile at this antithesis\");\r\ndelivering a lecture at Albany--with the lecture left behind.\r\n\r\n\"Got to work at once making abstracts from memory.... Spoke more than an\r\nhour.... Got my money--would rather have paid it than have had such an\r\nexperience. Felt as if my inner Guide had misled and deserted me. But\r\nsome good to some one may come of what I said and tried to say.\"\r\n\r\nShe returned from this trip very weary, only to find \"my lecture\r\nadvertised, not one line of it written--subject, 'Men's Women and\r\nWomen's Women.' Set to work at once, almost overpowered by the task, and\r\nthe shortness of the time.\"\r\n\r\nThe lecture was finished in the morning, delivered in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"Warm congratulations at the close.... Such a sense of relief!\"\r\n\r\nOn December 19 she notes the departure of \"dear Flossy and her dearest\r\nlittle Boy.... House very desolate without them. This boy is especially\r\ndear to Doctor Howe and myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 28._ Maria Mitchell's Club lecture to-day was beautiful\r\nexceedingly. I might have envied her the steady grasp and unbroken\r\nadvance of scientific study, did I not feel sure that God gives to each\r\nhis own work. Mine, such as it is, would be helped and beautified by the\r\nknowledge which she imparts so easily, but perhaps all of her that I\r\nshall remember and try to follow is her spirit. Her silver hair seems\r\nlustrous with spiritual brightness, as do her dark eyes. Her movements\r\nare full of womanly grace, not ballroom grace.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom now on the movement is _sempre crescendo_. Work for peace, work for\r\nclubs; lecturing, preaching, tending the Doctor in his days of illness;\r\ntaking the youngest daughter to balls and parties; founding a club for\r\nher, too. She felt that the young girls of Maud's age needed the onward\r\nimpulse as much as their elders; accordingly, in November, 1871, she\r\ncalled together a meeting of young women, and with their aid and\r\ngood-will formed the Saturday Morning Club of Boston. The energy with\r\nwhich this organization sprang into being showed that the time was ripe\r\nfor it. That energy, handed on through two generations, is no less\r\nlively to-day; the name of the club recalls a hundred beautiful and\r\ninteresting occasions.\r\n\r\nThe Journal hurries us on from day to arduous day. Even the aspiration\r\nof New Year's Day, 1873, breathes the note of hurry: \"Dear Lord, let me\r\nthis year be worthy to call upon thy name!\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 5 finds her on another quest: \"Mem. Never to come by this route\r\nagain. Had to turn out at Utica at 4 A.M. Three hours in depot....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 1._ Went to Saturday Morning Club. Found that John Fiske had\r\nfailed them. Was told to improvise a lecture on the spot. Did so....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 5._ Went to hear the arguments in favor of rescinding the vote\r\nof censure against Charles Sumner....\"\r\n\r\n[In 1872, Sumner introduced in the Senate of the United States a\r\nresolution that the names of battles with fellow-countrymen should not\r\nbe continued in the Army Register, nor placed on the regimental colors\r\nof the United States. This measure was violently opposed; the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts denounced it as \"an insult to the loyal\r\nsoldiery of the Nation, ... meeting the unqualified condemnation of the\r\nCommonwealth.\" For more than a year Sumner's friends, headed by John G.\r\nWhittier, strove to obtain the rescinding of this censure; it was not\r\ntill 1874 that it was rescinded by a large majority.]\r\n\r\n\"_March 10._ A morning for work in my own room, so rare a luxury that I\r\nhardly know how to use it. Begin with my Greek Testament....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 17._ Radical Club.... It was an interesting sitting, but I felt\r\nas if the Club had about done its work. People get to believing that\r\ntalk turns the world: it is much, but it is nothing without work....\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 27._ Fifty-four years old to-day. Thank God for what I have had\r\nand hope to have.... In the afternoon my dear children had a beautiful\r\nbirthday party for me, including most of my old friends and some of the\r\nnewer ones. Agassiz came, and his wife; he brought a bouquet and kissed\r\nme. I had beautiful flowers.... Poor Chev was ill with a frightful\r\nheadache. I was much touched by the dear children's affectionate device\r\nand shall remember this birthday.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first of the Birthday Receptions, which were to be our\r\nhappiest festivals through many happy years.\r\n\r\nMonday, June 2, was the day she had appointed as Mothers' Peace Day, her\r\nannual Peace Festival.\r\n\r\n\"The day of many prayers dawned propitious, and was as bright and clear\r\nas I could have wished.\"\r\n\r\nShe was up early, and found the hall \"beautifully decorated with many\r\nfine bouquets, wreaths, and baskets, the white dove of Peace rising\r\nabove other emblems.\" There were two services, morning and evening, and\r\nmany speakers. \"Mr. Tilden and Mr. Garrison both did nobly for me....\r\nThank God for so much!\"\r\n\r\nShe had the great joy of hearing that the day was celebrated in other\r\ncountries besides her own. In London, Geneva, Constantinople, and\r\nvarious other places, services were held, and men and women prayed and\r\nsang in behalf of peace: this she counted among the precious things of\r\nthe year, and of several years to come.\r\n\r\n\"_June 6._ Quiet at last, and face to face with the eternal Gospel.\r\nWeary and confused, anxious to wind up my business well, and begin my\r\npolyglot sheet....\"\r\n\r\nYet on June 10 she is arriving in New York at 5.40 A.M., bound for a\r\npeace meeting.\r\n\r\n\"_June 11._ I got two bricks from the dear old house at the corner of\r\nBroadway and Bond Street, now all down and rebuilding. Will have one\r\nenamelled for myself. Ah, Lord, what a bitter lesson is in this\r\ntearing-down! How I was wanting in duty to the noble parent who built\r\nthis grand home for me! I hope to help young people to understand\r\nsomething of parental love and its responsibilities. But parents also\r\nmust study children, since each new soul may require a new method.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 12._ Home very gladly. Helped Maud with her Latin. At 3.30 to\r\nrehearse 'Midsummer-Night's Dream.' I Hermia and Snout. At 7.30 the\r\nreading, which was the pleasantest we have had.\"\r\n\r\n[These readings were in the vestry of the Church of the Disciples. Mr.\r\nClarke, our mother, Erving Winslow, and others of the congregation took\r\npart: we remember the late Professor James Mills Pierce as Orlando in\r\n\"As You Like It\"; his beautiful reading of the part contrasting oddly\r\nwith his middle-aged, long-bearded personality. Our mother's rendering\r\nof Maria in \"Twelfth Night\" was something to remember.]\r\n\r\n\"_June 17._ Up at five and to get a boat. Maud and the Lieutenant\r\n[Zalinski] rowed me to Fort Independence and back, a most refreshing\r\nexcursion. Dear Dr. Hedge came out to make a morning visit. I kept him\r\nas long as I could. We talked of Bartol, Rubinstein, Father Taylor, and\r\nMargaret Fuller, whom he knew when she was fourteen years old. He urged\r\nme to labor for dress reform, which he considered much needed. Had\r\npreached two sermons on the subject which his dressy parishioners\r\nresented, telling him that their husbands approved of their fine\r\nclothes. I begged him to unearth these sermons and give them to us at\r\nthe club. We spoke of marriage, and I unfolded rapidly my military and\r\nmoral theory of human relations. Thought of a text for a sermon on this\r\nsubject: 'Arise, take up thy bed and walk.' This because the ills of\r\nmarriage which are deemed incurable are not. We must meet them with the\r\nenergetic will which converts evil into good, and without which all good\r\ndegenerates into evil.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJuly finds her at Oak Glen. She is full of texts and sermons, but makes\r\ntime to write to Fanny Perkins,[75] proposing \"_Picnics with a Purpose_,\r\nsketching, seaside lectures, astronomical evenings.\" This thought may\r\nhave been the germ from which grew the Town and Country Club, of which\r\nmore hereafter.\r\n\r\n  [75] Mrs. Charles C. Perkins.\r\n\r\nThe writing of sermons seems to have crowded serious poetry out of sight\r\nin these days, but the Comic Muse was always at hand with tambourine and\r\nflageolet, ready to strike up at a moment's notice. There was much\r\ncoming and going of young men and maidens at Oak Glen in those days, and\r\nmuch singing of popular songs of a melancholy or desperate cast. The\r\nmaiden was requested to take back the heart she had given; what was its\r\nanguish to her? There were handfuls of earth in a coffin hid, a coffin\r\nunder the daisies, the beautiful, beautiful daisies; and so on, and so\r\non, _ad lachrymam_. She bore all this patiently; but one day she said to\r\nMaud, \"Come! You and these young persons know nothing whatever of real\r\ntrouble. I will make you a song about a real trouble!\" And she produced,\r\nwords and tune, the following ditty:--\r\n\r\nCOOKERY BOOKERY, OH!\r\n\r\n  My Irish cook has gone away\r\n  Upon my dinner-party day;\r\n  I don't know what to do or say--\r\n      Cookery bookery, oh!\r\n\r\n    _Chorus_:\r\n\r\n  Sing, saucepan, range, and kitchen fire!\r\n  Sing, coals are high and always higher!\r\n  Sing, crossed and vexed, till you expire!\r\n      Cookery bookery, oh!\r\n\r\n  She could cook every kind of dish,\r\n  \"Wittles\" of meat and \"wittles\" of fish,\r\n  And soup as fancy as you wish--\r\n      And she is gone away!\r\n\r\n  She weighed two hundred pounds of cheek,\r\n  She had a voice that made me meek,\r\n  I had to listen when she did speak--\r\n      Cookery bookery, oh!\r\n\r\n  My husband comes, a saucy elf,\r\n  And eyes the saucepan on the shelf;\r\n  Says he, \"Why don't you cook yourself?\"\r\n      Cookery bookery, oh!\r\n\r\n    _Chorus_:\r\n\r\n  Sing, saucepan, range, and kitchen fire!\r\n  Sing, coals are high and always higher!\r\n  Sing, crossed and vexed, till you expire!\r\n      Cookery bookery, oh!\r\n\r\n_Jocosa Lyra!_ one chord of its gay music suggests another. It may have\r\nbeen in this summer that she wrote \"The Newport Song,\" which also has\r\nits own lilting melody.\r\n\r\n  _Non sumus fashionabiles:\r\n  Non damus dapes splendides:_\r\n  But in a modest way, you know,\r\n  We like to see our money go:\r\n  _Et gaudeamus igitur_,\r\n  Our soul has nought to fidget her!\r\n\r\n  We do not care to quadrigate\r\n  On Avenues in gilded state:\r\n  No gold-laced footmen laugh behind\r\n  At our vacuity of mind:\r\n  But in a modest one-horse shay,\r\n  We rumble, tumble as we may,\r\n  _Et gaudeamus igitur_,\r\n  Our soul has nought to fidget her!\r\n\r\n  When æstivation is at end,\r\n  We've had our fun and seen our friend.\r\n  No thought of payment makes us ill,\r\n  We don't know such a word as \"bill\":\r\n  _Et gaudeamus igitur_,\r\n  Our soul has nought to fidget her!\r\n\r\nShe always tried to go at least once in the summer to see the old people\r\nat the Town Farm, a pleasant, gray old house, not far from Oak Glen.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon visited the poorhouse with J. and F. and found several\r\nof the old people again, old Nancy who used to make curious patchwork;\r\nold Benny, half-witted; Elsteth, Henrietta, and Harriet, very glad to\r\nsee us. Julia read them a Psalm, then Harriet and Elsteth sang an\r\ninterminable Methodist hymn, and I was moved to ask if they would like\r\nto have me pray with them. They assented, and I can only say that my\r\nheart was truly lifted up by the sense of the universality of God's\r\npower and goodness, to which these forlorn ones could appeal as directly\r\nas could the most powerful, rich, or learned people.\"\r\n\r\nLater she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"The summer seems to me to have been rich in good and in interest as I\r\nreview it. Sweet, studious days, pleasant intercourse with friends, the\r\njoy of preaching, and very much in all this the well-being of my dear\r\nfamily, children and grandchildren, their father and grandfather\r\nenjoying them with me. This is much to thank God for.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the family lingered on after most of the household _impedimenta_\r\nhad been sent up to Boston, and were caught napping.\r\n\r\n\"Sitting quietly with Chev over the fire after a game of whist with\r\nJulia and Paddock,--a hack-driver knocked at the door of our little back\r\nparlor, saying that a gentleman was waiting at the front door for\r\nadmission. I opened the door and found Dr. Alex Voickoff, who had\r\nlearned in Boston of our being here and had come down to stay over\r\nSunday. The floors of nearly every parlor and bedroom had been newly\r\noiled. We had no spare bedding. I spared what I could from my\r\nill-provided bed--we made the guest as comfortable as we could. The\r\nbedding had been sent up to Boston. _Hinc illæ lachrymæ._\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 26._ Saw Salvini's 'Othello.' As wonderful as people say it\r\nis. The large theatre [the Boston] packed, and so quiet that you could\r\nhave heard a pin drop. From the serene majesty of the opening scenes to\r\nthe agony of the end, all was grand and astounding even to us to whom\r\nthe play is familiar. The Italian version seemed to me very fine,\r\npreserving all the literary points of the original. In fact it seemed as\r\nif I had always before heard the play through an English translation, so\r\nmuch did the Italian speech and action light it up.\"\r\n\r\nShe found Salvini's \"Hamlet\" \"not so good for him as 'Othello,' yet he\r\nwas wonderful in it, and made a very strong impression.\"\r\n\r\nShe met the great actor, and found his manners \"cordial, natural, and\r\nhigh-toned.\" She gave a dinner-party for him, and found him to improve\r\nmore and more on further acquaintance. He became a valued friend, always\r\ngreeted with delight.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1873, Richard Ward, her last surviving uncle, died. He had\r\nlived on at No. 8 Bond Street after the death of Uncle John, and had\r\nkept up the traditions of that hospitable house, always receiving her\r\nmost affectionately.\r\n\r\n\"_December 11._ Uncle Richard's funeral. A quiet one, but on the whole\r\nsatisfactory and almost pleasant, he having lived out his life and dying\r\nsurrounded by his children and other relatives, and the family gathering\r\naround his remains wearing an aspect of cordiality and mutual good-will.\r\nI put a sprig of white daphne in the folds of the marble drapery of dear\r\nfather's bust and kissed the bust, feeling that it had taken all of\r\nthese years to teach me his value and the value of the moral and\r\nspiritual inheritance which I had from him and could not wholly waste\r\nwith all the follies which checker the better intentions of my life. I\r\nwent to Greenwood and into the vault, and saw the sacred names of the\r\ndear departed on the slabs which sealed the deposit of their remains. It\r\nwas all like a dream and a sad one.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 12._ No. 8 Bond Street. I came down here to write the records\r\nof yesterday and to-day in this dear old house, whose thronging memories\r\nrise up to wring my heart, in the prospect of its speedy dismantlement\r\nand the division of its dear contents. Here I came on my return from\r\nEurope in 1844, bringing my dear Julia, then an infant of six months.\r\nUncle John had just bought and fitted it up. Here I came to attend\r\nSister Louisa's wedding, Uncle John being rather distant to me,\r\nsupposing that I had favored the marriage. Here I saw dear Brother\r\nMarion for the last time. Here I came in my most faulty and unhappy\r\nperiod. Here, after my first publications; here, to see my play acted at\r\nWallack's. Here, when death had taken my dearest Sammy from me. Uncle\r\nJohn was so kind and merciful at that time, and always except that once,\r\nwhen indeed he did not express _dis_pleasure, but I partly guessed it\r\nand learned it more fully afterwards. God's blessing rest upon the\r\nmemory of this hospitable and unstained house. It seems to me as if\r\nneither words nor tears could express the pain I feel in closing this\r\naccount with my father's generation.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most important episode of 1874, the visit to Samana, has already\r\nbeen described. Turning the leaves of the Journal for this year, we\r\nfeel that the change and break were necessary to her as well as to the\r\nDoctor. There were limits even to her strength.\r\n\r\n\"_January, 1874._ A sort of melancholy of confusion, not knowing how I\r\ncan possibly get through with the various requisitions made upon my\r\ntime, strength, thought, and sympathy. Usually I feel, even in these\r\nmoods, the nearness of divine help. To-day it seems out of my\r\nconsciousness, but is not on that account out of my belief....\"\r\n\r\n\"The past week one dreadful hurry. Things look colorless when you whirl\r\nso fast past them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The month ending to-day seems the most hurried of my life. Woman's\r\nClub, Saturday Club, Philosophical group, Maud's music, ditto party, and\r\nall her dressing and gayety, beside writing for [the Woman's] Journal,\r\n... two lectures [Salem and Weston], both gratuitous, and the care of\r\ngetting up and advertising Bishop Ferrette's lectures. And in all these\r\nthings I seem not to do, rather than to do, the dissipation of effort so\r\ncalls me away from the quiet, concentrated sort of work which I love.\"\r\n\r\nIt was time for the Doctor to say \"Come!\" and to carry her off to those\r\ntropical solitudes they had learned to love so well. Yet the departure\r\nwas painful, for Maud must be left behind. On March 1 we read:--\r\n\r\n\"Of to-day I wish to preserve the fact that, waking early in painful\r\nperplexity about Maud, Santo Domingo, etc., and praying that the right\r\nway might open for me and for all of us, my prayer seemed answered by\r\nthe very great comfort I had in hearing the prayer and sermon of Henry\r\nPowers of New York. The decided spiritual tone of the prayer made me\r\nfeel that I must try to take, every day, this energetic attitude of\r\nmoral will and purpose, even if I fail in much that I wish to do.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 27 she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"My birthday. Fifty-five years old. Still face to face with the mercies\r\nof God in health and sanity, enjoying all true pleasures more than ever\r\nand weaned from some false ones. I feel a great lassitude, probably from\r\nmy cold and yesterday's fatigue. I have not worked this year as I did\r\nthe year before, yet I have worked a good deal, too, and perhaps have\r\ntried more to fulfil the duty nearest at hand.... I thank God for my\r\ncontinued life, health, and comfort.... I ask to see Samana free before\r\nI go.... 'Thy will be done' is the true prayer.\"\r\n\r\nSamana was not to be free, spite of the efforts of its friends, and she\r\nwas not to see it again.\r\n\r\nThe record of this year and the next is a chronicle of arduous work,\r\nwith the added and ever-deepening note of anxiety; it was only for a\r\ntime that the visit to Samana checked the progress of the Doctor's\r\nphysical failure. He was able in the summer of 1874 to write the\r\nforty-third report of the Perkins Institution: an important one in which\r\nhe reviewed his whole work among the blind. He felt that this would\r\nprobably be his last earthly task; yet the following summer found him\r\nagain taking up the familiar work, laboring with what little strength\r\nwas left him, and when eyes and hand refused to answer the call of the\r\nspirit, dictating to his faithful secretary. It has been told elsewhere\r\nhow in this last summer of his life he labored to make more beautiful\r\nand more valuable the summer home which had become very dear to him.\r\n\r\nReturned to Green Peace, he had some happy days in his garden, but for\r\ngardener and garden they were the last days. The city had decided to put\r\na street through Green Peace: already workmen were digging trenches and\r\ncutting trees. Our mother went to the authorities, and told them of his\r\nfeeble condition. The work was stopped at once, and not resumed during\r\nhis lifetime.\r\n\r\nThrough these years her time was divided between the invalid and the\r\nmany public duties which had already taken possession of her life.\r\nLittle by little these were crowded out: instead of lecture or concert\r\ncame the ever-shortening walk with the Doctor, the evening game of whist\r\nor backgammon which lightened a little his burden of pain and weariness.\r\n\r\nYet she was preparing, on January 4, 1876, to keep a lecture engagement\r\nof long standing, when the blow fell. He was stricken down, and lay for\r\nsome days insensible, waiting the final summons.\r\n\r\nThere was no hope of his recovery: those around him waited patiently,\r\nany violence of grief held in check by the silent rebuke of the serene\r\nface on the pillow.\r\n\r\nThe day after his death she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I awoke at 4.30, but lay still to bear the chastening hand of God, laid\r\nupon me in severe mercy....\r\n\r\n\"Some good words came to me: 'Let not your heart be troubled,' etc. 'He\r\ndoth not willingly afflict,' etc.\r\n\r\n\"Before breakfast went into Chev's room, so sweet and peaceful.... I\r\nlaid my lace veil, my bridal veil, upon the head of his bedstead.... In\r\nplace of my dear husband I have now my foolish papers. Yet I have often\r\nleft him for them. God accept the poor endeavor of my life!\"\r\n\r\nOn the day after the funeral she writes: \"Began my new life to-day.\r\nPrayed God that it might have a greatly added use and earnestness.\"\r\n\r\nAnd several weeks later, after the memorial meeting in his honor:--\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday seems to have filled the measure of the past. To-day I must\r\nforward in the paths of the future. My dear love is sometimes with me,\r\nat least as an energizing and inspiring influence, but how shall I\r\ndeserve ever to see him again?\"\r\n\r\nThe paths of the future! She was to tread them with cheerful and willing\r\nfeet through many long years, never wholly losing the sense of\r\ncompanionship with her good comrade.\r\n\r\nShe devoted the spring of 1876 to the writing of a brief memoir of him,\r\nwhich was printed in pamphlet form and in raised type for the use of the\r\nblind. With the latter object in view the memoir was necessarily brief.\r\nThe labor of condensing into a small space the record of a long and\r\nsuper-active life was severe, but it was the tonic she needed. The days\r\nof quiet at Green Peace, the arduous work, with a page of Greek or a\r\nchapter of Baur for relaxation, brought mind and nerves back to their\r\nnormal condition.\r\n\r\nThe work speaks for itself. As it is little known to-day outside the\r\nschools for the blind, we quote the concluding paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\"In what is said, to-day, concerning the motherhood of the human race,\r\nthe social and spiritual aspects of this great office are not wholly\r\noverlooked. It must be remembered that there is also a fatherhood of\r\nhuman society, a vigilance and forethought of benevolence recognized in\r\nthe individuals who devote their best energies to the interests of\r\nmankind. The man to whose memory the preceding pages are dedicated is\r\none of those who have best filled this relation to their race. Watchful\r\nof its necessities, merciful to its shortcomings, careful of its\r\ndignity, and cognizant of its capacity, may the results of his labor be\r\nhanded down to future generations, and may his name and example be held\r\nin loving and lasting remembrance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S CAUSE\r\n\r\n1868-1910\r\n\r\n  Women who weave in hope the daily web,\r\n  Who leave the deadly depths of passion pure,\r\n  Who hold the stormy powers of will attent,\r\n  As Heaven directs, to act, or to endure;\r\n\r\n  No multitude strews branches in their way,\r\n  Not in their praise the loud arena strives;\r\n  Still as a flameless incense rises up\r\n  The costly patience of their offered lives.\r\n\r\n                                          J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that after the Doctor's death our mother felt that another\r\nchapter of life had begun for her. It was a changed world without that\r\ngreat and dominant personality. She missed the strength on which she had\r\nleaned for so many years, the weakness which through the past months she\r\nhad tended and cherished. Henceforth she must lead, not follow; must be\r\ncaptain instead of mate.\r\n\r\nIn another sense, the new life had actually begun for her some years\r\nbefore, when she first took up public activities; to those activities\r\nshe now turned the more ardently for the great void that was left in\r\nheart and home. We must now go back to the later sixties, and speak of\r\nher special interests at that time.\r\n\r\nLooking back over her long life, we see her in three aspects, those of\r\nthe student, the artist, the reformer. First came youth, with its ardent\r\nstudy; then maturity, with its output of poems, plays, essays. So far\r\nshe had followed the natural course of creative minds, which must absorb\r\nand assimilate in order that they may give out. It is in the third phase\r\nthat we find the aspect of her later life, a clear vision of the needs\r\nof humanity, and a profound hospitality which made it imperative for her\r\nto give with both hands not only what she had inherited, but what she\r\nhad earned. Having enjoyed unusual advantages herself, the moment she\r\nsaw the way to give other women these advantages, she was eager to \"help\r\nthe woman-standard new unfurled.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first number of the \"Woman's Journal,\" of which she was one of\r\nthe founders and first editors, she writes (January 8, 1870):--\r\n\r\n\"We who stand beside the cradle of this enterprise are not young in\r\nyears. Our children are speedily preparing to take our place in the\r\nranks of society. Some of us have been looking thoughtfully toward the\r\nfinal summons, not because of ill health or infirmity, but because,\r\nafter the establishment of our families, no great object intervened\r\nbetween ourselves and that last consummation. But these young\r\nundertakings detain us in life. While they need so much care and\r\ncounsel, we cannot consent to death. And this first year, at least, of\r\nour Journal, we are determined to live through.\"\r\n\r\nAgain she writes of this new departure:--\r\n\r\n\"In an unexpected hour a new light came to me, showing me a world of\r\nthought and character. The new domain was that of true womanhood, woman\r\nno longer in her ancillary relation to man, but in direct relation to\r\nthe divine plan and purpose, as a free agent fully sharing with man\r\nevery human right and every human responsibility. This discovery was\r\nlike the addition of a new continent to the map of the world. It did not\r\ncome all at once. In my philosophizing I at length reached the\r\nconclusion that woman must be the moral and spiritual equivalent of man.\r\nHow otherwise could she be entrusted with the awful and inevitable\r\nresponsibilities of maternity? The Civil War came to an end, leaving the\r\nslave not only emancipated but endowed with the full dignity of\r\ncitizenship. The women of the North had greatly helped to open the door\r\nwhich admitted him to freedom and its safeguard, the ballot. Was the\r\ndoor to be shut in their face?\"\r\n\r\nWhen this new world of thought, this new continent of sympathy was\r\nopened to her, she was nearly fifty years old. \"Oh! had I earlier\r\nknown,\" she exclaims, \"the power, the nobility, the intelligence which\r\nlie within the range of true womanhood, I had surely lived more wisely\r\nand to better purpose.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this new interest in her life, her old friend Tom Appleton\r\n(who had not the least sympathy with it) once said, \"Your mother's great\r\nimportance to this cause is that she forms a bridge between the world of\r\nsociety and the world of reform.\"\r\n\r\nShe soon found that she was not alone in her questioning; similar\r\nthoughts to hers were germinating in the minds of many women. In our\r\nown and other countries a host of earnest souls were awake, pressing\r\neagerly forward. In quick succession came the women's clubs and\r\ncolleges, the renewed demand for woman suffrage, the Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Women, the banding together of women ministers. The hour\r\nhad come, and the women. In all these varying manifestations of one\r\ngreat forward and upward movement in America, Julia Ward Howe was _pars\r\nmagna_. Indeed, the story of the latter half of her life is the story of\r\nthe Advance of Woman and the part she played in it.\r\n\r\nThe various phases may be taken in order. Oberlin, the first\r\ncoeducational college, was chartered in 1834. Vassar, the first college\r\nfor women only, was chartered in 1861, opened in 1865. Smith and\r\nWellesley followed in 1875. Considering this brave showing, it is\r\nstrange to recall the great fight before the barred doors of the great\r\nuniversities. The women knocked, gently at first, then strongly: our\r\nmother, Mrs. Agassiz, and the rest. They were greeted by a storm of\r\nprotest. Learned books were written, brilliant lectures delivered, to\r\nprove that a college education was ruinous to the health of women,\r\nperilous to that of future generations. The friends of Higher Education\r\nreplied in words no less ardent. Blast and counterblast rang forth.\r\nStill the patient hands knocked, the earnest voices called: till at\r\nlength--there being friends as well as foes inside--slowly, with much\r\ncreaking and many forebodings, the great doors opened; a crack, then a\r\nspace, till to-day they swing wide, and the Higher Education of Women\r\nnow stands firm as the Pyramids.\r\n\r\nThe idea of woman suffrage had long been repugnant to our mother. The\r\ndemand for it seemed unreasonable; she was inclined to laugh both at the\r\ncause and its advocates; yet when, in November, 1868, Colonel Thomas\r\nWentworth Higginson asked her to give her name to a call for a meeting\r\nin behalf of woman suffrage she did not refuse. It would be \"a liberal\r\nand friendly meeting,\" the Colonel said, \"without bitterness or\r\nextravagance.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day of the meeting she \"strayed into Horticultural Hall\" in her\r\n\"rainy-day suit, with no idea of taking any active part in the\r\nproceedings.\" Indeed, she had hoped to remain unnoticed, until summoned\r\nby an urgent message to join those who sat upon the platform;\r\nreluctantly she obeyed the summons. With this simple action the old\r\norder changed for her. On the platform were gathered the woman suffrage\r\nleaders, some of whom she already knew: William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell\r\nPhillips, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, James Freeman Clarke; veteran\r\ncaptains of Reform, her husband's old companions-in-arms. Looking in\r\ntheir steadfast faces, she felt that she belonged with them; that she\r\nmust help to draw the car of progress, not drag like a brake on its\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nBeside these were some unknown to her. She saw now for the first time\r\nthe sweet face of Lucy Stone, heard the silver voice which was to be\r\ndear to her through many years. \"Here stood the true woman, pure, noble,\r\ngreat-hearted, with the light of her good life shining in every feature\r\nof her face.\" These men and women had been the champions of the slave.\r\nThey now asked for wives and mothers those civil rights which had been\r\ngiven to the negro; \"that impartial justice for which, if for anything,\r\na Republican Government should stand.\" Their speech was earnest; she\r\nlistened as to a new gospel. When she was asked to speak, she could only\r\nsay, \"I am with you.\"\r\n\r\nWith the new vision came the call of a new duty. \"What can I do?\" she\r\nasked. The answer was ready. The New England Woman Suffrage Association\r\nwas formed, and she was elected its first president. This office she\r\nheld, with some interruptions, through life. It is well to recall the\r\npatient, faithful work of the pioneer suffragists, who, without money or\r\nprestige, spent _themselves_ for the cause. Their efforts, compared to\r\nthe well-organized and well-financed campaigns of to-day, are as a\r\n\"certain upper chamber\" compared with the basilica of St. Peter, yet it\r\nwas in that quiet room that the tongues of Pentecost spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad,\" she often said, \"to have joined the suffrage movement,\r\nbecause it has brought me into such high company.\"\r\n\r\nThe convert buckled to her new task with all her might, working for it\r\nearly and late with an ardor that counted no cost.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! dear Mrs. Howe, you are so _full_ of inspiration!\" cried a foolish\r\nwoman. \"It enables you to do _so much_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Inspiration!\" said \"dear Mrs. Howe,\" shortly. \"Inspiration means\r\n_perspiration_!\"\r\n\r\nShe says of her early work for suffrage:--\r\n\r\n\"One of the comforts which I found in the new association was the relief\r\nwhich it afforded me from a sense of isolation and eccentricity. For\r\nyears past I had felt strongly impelled to lend my voice to the\r\nconvictions of my heart. I had done this in a way, from time to time,\r\nalways with the feeling that my course in doing so was held to call for\r\napology and explanation by the men and women with whose opinions I had\r\nhitherto been familiar. I now found a sphere of action in which this\r\nmode of expression no longer appeared singular or eccentric, but simple,\r\nnatural, and, under the circumstances, inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no small thing for her to take up this burden. The Doctor,\r\nalthough a believer in equal suffrage, was strongly opposed to her\r\ntaking any active part in public life. He felt as Grandfather Howe had\r\nfelt forty years before when his son Sam spoke in public for the sake of\r\nGreece; it jarred on his traditions. Others of the family also deplored\r\nthe new departure, and her personal friends almost with one accord held\r\nup hands of horror or deprecation. These things were inexpressibly\r\npainful to her; she loved approbation; the society and sympathy of \"kent\r\nfolk,\" whose traditions corresponded with her own; but her hand was on\r\nthe plough; there was no turning back.\r\n\r\nSuffrage worked her hard. The following year the New England Woman\r\nSuffrage Association issued a call for the formation of a national body;\r\nthe names signed were Lucy Stone, Caroline M. Severance, Julia Ward\r\nHowe, T. W. Higginson, and G. H. Vibbert. Representatives from\r\ntwenty-one States assembled in Cleveland, November 24, 1869, and formed\r\nthe American Woman Suffrage Association. There was already a \"National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association,\" formed a few months earlier; the new\r\norganization differed from the other in some points of policy, notably\r\nin the fact that men as well as women were recognized among the leaders.\r\nColonel Higginson was its president at one time, Henry Ward Beecher,\r\nBishop Gilbert Haven, and Dudley Foulke at others. The New England\r\nWoman's Club also admitted men to membership: it was a point our mother\r\nhad much at heart. She held that the Quaker organization was the best,\r\nwith its separate meetings of men and women, supplemented by a joint\r\nsession of both. She always insisted upon the salutary influence that\r\nmen and women exercise upon one another.\r\n\r\n\"The two sexes police each other,\" she often said. She always maintained\r\nthe importance of their united action in matters of public as of private\r\ninterest. She was essentially a humanist in contradistinction to a\r\nfeminist.\r\n\r\nShe worked for the American Association during the twenty-one years of\r\nits separate existence, first as foreign corresponding secretary,\r\nafterward as president, and in various other capacities. When, in 1890,\r\nthe two societies united to form the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, she became and continued through life one of the\r\nvice-presidents of that body. From the first, she was recognized as an\r\ninvaluable leader. The years of philosophical study had made her mind\r\nsupple, alert, quick to grasp and to respond, even as the study of\r\nlanguages brought her the gift of ready speech and pure diction. Her\r\nlong practice in singing had given her voice strength, sweetness, and\r\ncarrying power; above all, she was a natural orator, and speaking was a\r\njoy to her. The first time she ever made a speech in public was to a\r\ngroup of soldiers of the Army of the Potomac on the occasion of a visit\r\nto Washington during the war. She had driven out to visit the camp\r\noutside the Capital. Colonel William B. Greene disconcerted her very\r\nmuch by saying, \"Mrs. Howe, you must speak to my men.\"\r\n\r\nShe refused, and ran away to hide in an adjacent tent. The Colonel\r\ninsisted, and finally she managed to make a very creditable little\r\nspeech to the soldiers.\r\n\r\nNow, she no longer ran away when called upon to speak. Wherever the work\r\ncalled her, she went gladly; like St. Paul, she was \"in journeyings\r\noften, ... in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often\"; the\r\njournals are full of incidents picturesque to read, uncomfortable to\r\nlive through. Occasionally, after some tremendous exertion, we read,\r\n\"Maud must not know of this!\" or, \"No one must ever know that I took the\r\nwrong train!\"\r\n\r\nMuch of her most important work for woman suffrage was done at the State\r\nHouse, Boston. In Massachusetts, the custom of bringing this subject\r\nbefore the legislature every year long prevailed. She always went to\r\nthese hearings. She considered it a privilege to take part in them;\r\ncounted them \"among her most valued recollections.\" They extended over\r\nforty years or more.\r\n\r\nThese occasions were often exasperating as well as fatiguing. She never\r\nwearied of presenting the arguments for suffrage; she often suffered\r\nvexation of spirit in refuting those brought against it, but she never\r\nrefused the battle. \"If I were mad enough,\" she said once, \"I could\r\nspeak in Hebrew!\"\r\n\r\nShe was \"mad enough\" when at a certain hearing woman suffrage was\r\ncondemned as a \"minority cause.\" Her words, if not in Hebrew, show the\r\nfighting spirit of ancient Israel.\r\n\r\nWe quote from memory:--\r\n\r\nThe Reverend ----: \"The fact that most women are indifferent or opposed\r\nis a sufficient proof that woman suffrage is wrong.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Howe: \"May I ask one question? Were the Twelve Apostles wrong in\r\ntrying to bring about a better social condition when almost the whole\r\ncommunity was opposed to them?\"\r\n\r\nDr. ----: \"I suppose that question was asked merely for rhetorical\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Howe (having asked for two minutes to reply, with the whispered\r\ncomment, \"_I shall die_ if I am not allowed to speak!\"): \"I do not know\r\nhow it is with Dr. ----, but I was not brought up to use the Bible for\r\nrhetorical effect. To my mind, the suffragists and their opponents are\r\nlike the wise and the foolish virgins of the parable, equal in number\r\nbut not in wisdom. When the Bridegroom cometh, may Dr. ---- have his\r\nwedding garment ready!\"\r\n\r\nShe thus recalls some of the scenes in the State House where she was so\r\nlong a familiar figure:--\r\n\r\n\"I have again and again been one of a deputation charged with laying\r\nbefore a legislature the injustice of the law which forbids the husband\r\na business contract with his wife, and of that which denies to a married\r\nwoman the right to be appointed guardian of her children. We reasoned\r\nalso against what in legal language is termed 'the widow's quarantine,'\r\nthe ordinance which forbids a widow to remain in her husband's house\r\nmore than forty days without paying rent, the widower in such case\r\npossessing an unlimited right to abide under the roof of his deceased\r\nwife. Finally, we dared ask that night-walkers of the male sex should be\r\nmade liable to the same penalties as women for the same offence. Our\r\nbill passed the legislature, and became part of the laws of\r\nMassachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere she writes: \"In Massachusetts the suffragists worked for\r\nfifty-five years before they succeeded in getting a law making mothers\r\nequal guardians of their minor children with the fathers. In Colorado,\r\nwhen the women were enfranchised, the next legislature passed such a\r\nbill.\" Of the movement by which women won a right to have a voice in the\r\neducation of their children, she says: \"The proposal to render women\r\neligible for service on the School Board was met at first with derision\r\nand with serious disapproval. The late Abby W. May had much to do with\r\nthe early consideration of this measure, and the work which finally\r\nresulted in its adoption had its first beginning in the parlors of the\r\nNew England Woman's Club, where special meetings were held in its\r\nbehalf. The extension of the school suffrage to women followed, after\r\nmuch work on the part of men and of women.\"\r\n\r\n\"These meetings,\" she said once, speaking before the Massachusetts Woman\r\nSuffrage Association, \"show, among other things, the character of those\r\nwho believe in suffrage with their whole heart. We who are gathered here\r\nare not a frantic, shrieking mob. We are not contemners of marriage, nor\r\nneglecters of home and offspring. We are individually allowed to be men\r\nand women of sound intellect, of reputable life, having the same stake\r\nand interest in the well-being of the community that others have. Most\r\nof us are persons of moderate competence, earned or inherited. We have\r\nhad, or hope to have, our holy fireside, our joyful cradle, our decent\r\nbank account. Why should any consider us as the enemies of society, we\r\nwho have everything to gain by its good government?\"\r\n\r\nIt seems fitting to add a few more of her words in behalf of the cause\r\nwhich she served so long,--words spoken at Club meetings, at Conventions\r\nbefore Legislatures.\r\n\r\n\"But besides the philosophy of woman suffrage, we want its religion.\r\nHuman questions are not glorified until they are brought into touch with\r\nthe Divine....\"\r\n\r\n\"The weapon of Christian warfare is the ballot, which represents the\r\npeaceable assertion of conviction and will. Adopt it, O you women, with\r\nclean hands and a pure heart!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The religion which makes me a moral agent equally with my father and\r\nbrother, gives me my right and title to the citizenship which I am here\r\nto assert. I ought to share equally with them its privileges and its\r\nduties. No man can have more at stake in the community than I have.\r\nImposition of taxes, laws concerning public health, order, and morality,\r\naffect me precisely as they affect the male members of my family, and I\r\nam bound equally with them to look to the maintenance of a worthy and\r\nproper standard and status in all of these departments.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"God forbid that in this country chivalry and legislation should be set\r\none against the other. I ask you, gentlemen, to put your chivalry into\r\nyour legislation. Let the true Christian knighthood find its stronghold\r\nin your ranks. Arm yourselves with the best reasons, with the highest\r\nresolve, and deliver us poor women from the injustice which oppresses\r\nand defrauds us.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Revere the religion of home. Keep its altar flame bright in your\r\nheart.... The vestals of ancient Rome were at once guardians of the\r\nhearth and custodians of the archives of the Roman State. So, in every\r\ntime, the home conserves the sacred flame of life, and the destiny of\r\nthe nation rests with those who keep it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Go abroad with the majesty and dignity of your home about you.... Let\r\nthe modest graces of the fireside adorn you in the great gathering. This\r\nis a new sort of home missionary, one who shall carry the blessed\r\nspirit of home wherever she goes, a spirit of rest, of healing, of\r\nreconciliation and good-will.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"One aspect of this [the military argument] would make the protection\r\nwhich men are supposed to give to women in time of war the equivalent\r\nfor the political rights denied them. But, gentlemen, let me ask what\r\nprotection can you give us which shall compare with the protection we\r\ngive you when you are born, little helpless creatures, into the world,\r\nwithout feet to stand upon, or hands to help yourselves? Without this\r\ntender, this unceasing protection, no man of you would live to grow up.\r\nIt may easily happen that no man of a whole generation shall ever be\r\ncalled upon to defend the women of his country in the field. But it\r\ncannot happen that the women of any generation shall fail to give their\r\nunwearied and energetic protection to the infant men born of it. Some of\r\nus know how full of labor and detail this protection is; what anxious\r\ndays, what sleepless nights it involves. The mothers are busy at home,\r\nnot only building up the bodies of the little men, but building up their\r\nminds too, teaching them to be gentle, pure and honest, cultivating the\r\nelements of the human will, that great moralizing power on which the\r\nState and the Church depend. A man is very happy if he can ever repay to\r\nhis mother the protection she gave him in his infancy. So, the plea of\r\nprotection has two sides.\r\n\r\n\"If manhood suffrage is unsatisfactory, it does not at all show that\r\nwoman suffrage would be. On the contrary, we might make it much better\r\nby bringing to it the feminine mind, which, in a way, complements the\r\nmasculine, and so, I think, completes the mind of humanity. We are half\r\nof humanity, and I do frankly believe that we have half the intelligence\r\nand good sense of humanity, and that it is quite time that we should\r\nexpress not only our sentiments but our determined will, to set our\r\nfaces as a flint toward justice and right, and to follow these through\r\nthe difficult path, through the thorny wilderness. Not to the bitter\r\nend, but a very sweet end, and I hope it may be before my end comes.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer last service to the cause of woman suffrage was to send a circular\r\nletter to all the editors and to all the ministers of four leading\r\ndenominations in the four oldest suffrage States, Wyoming, Colorado,\r\nUtah, and Idaho, asking whether equal suffrage worked well or ill. She\r\nreceived 624 answers, 62 not favorable, 46 in doubt, and 516 in favor. A\r\nletter from her to the London \"Times,\" stating these results, appeared\r\non the same day that the news of her death was cabled to Europe.\r\n\r\nThinking of the long years of effort which followed her adoption of the\r\ncause of woman suffrage, a word of the Doctor's, spoken in 1875, comes\r\nvividly to mind.\r\n\r\n\"Your cause,\" said he, \"lacks one element of success, and that is\r\nopposition. It is so distinctly just that it will slide into\r\npopularity.\" He little thought that the cause was to wait forty years\r\nfor that slide!\r\n\r\nSide by side with the suffrage movement, growing along with it and with\r\nthe women's clubs, and in time to be absorbed by them, was another\r\nmovement which was for many years very dear to her, the Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Women.\r\n\r\nThis Association had its beginning in 1873, when Sorosis, then a sturdy\r\ninfant, growing fast and reaching out in every direction, issued a call\r\nfor a Congress of Women in New York in the autumn of that year. She says\r\nof this call:---\r\n\r\n\"Many names, some known, others unknown to me, were appended to the\r\ndocument first sent forth. My own was asked for. Should I give or\r\nwithhold it? Among the signatures already obtained, I saw that of Maria\r\nMitchell,[76] and this determined me to give my own.\"\r\n\r\n  [76] She had a great regard and admiration for Miss Mitchell. Scientific\r\n  achievement seemed to her well-nigh miraculous, and roused in her an\r\n  almost childlike reverence.\r\n\r\nShe went to the Congress, and \"viewed its proceedings a little\r\ncritically at first,\" its plan appearing to her \"rather vast and vague.\"\r\n\r\nYet she felt the idea of the Association to be a good one; and when it\r\nwas formed, with the above title, and with Mrs. Livermore as president,\r\nshe was glad to serve on a sub-committee, charged with selecting topics\r\nand speakers for the first annual Congress.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Association was \"to consider and present practical\r\nmethods for securing to women higher intellectual, moral, and physical\r\nconditions, with a view to the improvement of all domestic and social\r\nrelations.\"\r\n\r\nAt its first Congress she said:\r\n\r\n\"How can women best associate their efforts for the amelioration of\r\nSociety? We must come together in a teachable and religious spirit.\r\nWomen, while building firmly and definitely the fabric they decide to\r\nrear, must yet build with an individual tolerance which their combined\r\nand corporate wisdom may better explain. The form of the Association\r\nshould be representative, in a true and wide sense. Deliberation in\r\ncommon, mutual instruction, achievement for the whole better and more\r\nvaluable than the success of any,--these should be the objects held\r\nconstantly in view. The good of all the aim of each. The discipline of\r\nlabor, faith, and sacrifice is necessary. Our growth in harmony of will\r\nand in earnestness of purpose will be far more important than in\r\nnumbers.\"\r\n\r\nOne hundred and ninety women formed this Association: a year later there\r\nwere three hundred. The second Congress was held in Chicago, with an\r\nattendance \"very respectable in numbers and character from the first,\r\nand very full in afternoon and evening.\"\r\n\r\nOn the second day, October 16, 1874, the subject considered was \"Crime\r\nand Reform.\" The Journal says:--\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Ellen Mitchell's paper on fallen women was first-rate throughout.\r\nI spoke first after it, saying that we must carry the war into Africa\r\nand reform the men....\"\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the Congress grew more and more important to her. That\r\nof 1875 found her \"much tossed in mind\" about going, on account of the\r\nDoctor's ill health. She consulted Mr. Clarke, but felt afterward that\r\nthis was a mistake.\r\n\r\n\"My dæmon says: 'Go and say nothing. Nobody can help you bear your own\r\nchild.'\"\r\n\r\nShe went.\r\n\r\nNo matter how fatiguing these journeys were, she never failed to find\r\nsome enjoyment in them; many were the pleasant \"fruits of friendship\"\r\ngathered along the way. Some one of the sisters was sure to have a tiny\r\nteapot in her basket; another would produce a spirit-lamp; they drank\r\ntheir tea, shared their sandwiches, and were merry. She loved to travel\r\nwith her \"dear big Livermore,\" with Lucy Stone, and the faithful\r\nBlackwells, father and daughter; perhaps her best-loved companion was\r\nEdnah Cheney, her \"esteemed friend of many years, excellent in counsel\r\nand constant and loyal in regard.\"\r\n\r\nOnce she and Mrs. Cheney appeared together at an \"A.A.W.\" meeting in a\r\nSouthern city, where speaking and singing were to alternate on the\r\nprogramme. It was in their later years: both were silver-haired and\r\nwhite-capped. Our mother was to announce the successive numbers.\r\nGlancing over the programme, she saw that Mr. So-and-So was to sing \"The\r\nTwo Grenadiers.\" With a twinkling glance toward Mrs. Cheney, she\r\nannounced, \"The next number will be 'The Two Granny Dears'!\"\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Antoinette Blackwell, describing one of these journeys,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"As we went onward I was ready to close my eyes and 'loll' or look\r\nlazily out to see the flying landscape seem to be doing the work. When\r\nI roused enough to look at Mrs. Howe she was reading. Later, I looked\r\nagain, she was still reading. This went on mile after mile till I was\r\nenough interested to step quietly across the aisle and peep over Mrs.\r\nHowe's shoulder without disturbing her. She was reading a Greek volume,\r\napparently with as much enjoyment as most of us gain from reading in\r\nplain English when we are not tired.... With apparent unwearied\r\nenjoyment, she told us anecdotes, repeated the little stories and rhymes\r\nand sang the little songs which she had given to her children and\r\ngrandchildren....\r\n\r\n\"We lingered at the breakfast table in the morning and among other\r\nthings came to comparing social likes and dislikes. 'I never can bring\r\nmyself to destroy the least bit of paper,' said Mrs. Howe, meaning paper\r\nwritten on, containing the record of human thought and feeling which\r\nmight be of worth, and its only record. To her these were the chief\r\nvalues of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe following notes are taken from the record of \"A.A.W.\" journeys in\r\nthe eighties:--\r\n\r\n\"_Buffalo, October 22, 1881._ I felt quite distracted about leaving home\r\nwhen I came this way for the Congress, but have felt clear about the\r\ngood of it, ever since. I rarely have much religious meditation in these\r\ndays, except to be very sorry for a very faulty life. I will therefore\r\nrecord the fact that I have felt an unusual degree of religious comfort\r\nin these last days. It seemed a severe undertaking to preach to-day\r\nafter so busy a week, and with little or no time for preparation. But my\r\ntext came to me as it usually does, and a hope that the sermon would be\r\ngiven to me, which, indeed, it seemed to be. I thought it out in bed\r\nlast night and this morning....\"\r\n\r\n  \"My beautiful, beautiful West,\r\n  I clasp thee to my breast!\r\n  Or rather down I lie,\r\n  Like a little old babe and cry,\r\n  A babe to second childhood born,\r\n  Astonished at the mighty morn,\r\n  And only pleading to be fed,\r\n  From Earth's illimitable bread!\"\r\n\r\n\"Left Schenectady yesterday. Drawing-room car. Read Greek a good deal.\r\nAt Syracuse I took the tumbler of the car and ran out to get some milk,\r\netc., for supper. Spent 25 cents, and took my slender meal in the car,\r\non a table. After this, slept profoundly all the evening; took the\r\nsleeper at Rochester, and slept like the dead, having had very\r\ninsufficient sleep for two nights past. Was awakened early to get out at\r\nCleveland--much detained by a young woman who got into the dressing-room\r\nbefore me, and stayed to make an elaborate toilet, keeping every one\r\nelse out. When at last she came out, I said to her, 'Well, madam, you\r\nhave taken your own time, to the inconvenience of everybody else. You\r\nare the most selfish woman I ever travelled with.' Could get only a cup\r\nof coffee and a roll at Cleveland--much confusion about cars--regained\r\nmine, started, and found that I had left my trunk at Cleveland,\r\nunchecked. Flew to conductor, who immediately took measures to have it\r\nforwarded. Must wait all day at Shelby, in the most forlorn hole I ever\r\nsaw called a hotel. No parlor, a dark bedroom for me to stay in, a cold\r\nhell without the fire, and a very hot one with it. Dirty bed not made\r\nup, a sinister likeness of Schuyler Colfax hanging high on the wall, and\r\na print of the managers of Andy Johnson's impeachment. I--in distress\r\nabout my trunk--have telegraphed to Mansfield for the title of my\r\nlecture and learn that it is 'Polite Society.' Must give it without the\r\nmanuscript, and must borrow a gown to give it in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Minnesota in Winter_\r\n\r\n\"The twistings and turnings of a lecture trip have brought me twice, in\r\nthe present season, to Minnesota....\r\n\r\n\"To an Easterner, a daily walk or two is the first condition of health.\r\nHere, the frost seemed to enter one's very bones, and to make locomotion\r\ndifficult.... Life at the hotel was mostly an anxious _tête-à-tête_ with\r\nan air-tight stove. Sometimes you roasted before it, sometimes you\r\nfroze. As you crammed it with wood at night, you said, 'Will you, oh!\r\nwill you burn till morning?' Finally, on the coldest night of all, and\r\nat that night's noon, you bade it farewell, on your way to the midnight\r\ntrain, and wondered whether you should be likely to go further and fare\r\nworse....\r\n\r\n\"After the lecture an informal sitting was held in the parlor of my\r\nhostess, at which there was much talk of the clubs of Boston; 'If I\r\nforget thee, O Jerusalem!' being the predominant tone in the minds of\r\nthose present. And at noon, away, away, in the caboose of a freight car,\r\nto meet the passenger train at Owatonna, and so reach Minneapolis by\r\nearly evening.\r\n\r\n\"To travel in such a caboose is a somewhat rough experience. The dirt is\r\ngrimy and of long standing. The pictures nailed up on the boards are not\r\nof an edifying description. The railroad employees who have admitted us\r\ninto their place of refuge wear dirty overalls, and eat their dinner out\r\nof tin pails all afloat with hot coffee. One of my own sex keeps me in\r\ncountenance....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Minneapolis_\r\n\r\n\"Twenty years ago, a small collection of wooden houses, of no particular\r\naccount, except for the natural beauties of the spot on which they\r\nstood. Now, a thriving and well-built city, whose manufacturers have\r\nsettled the controversy between use and beauty, by appropriating the\r\nFalls of St. Anthony to the running of their saw- and flour-mills. My\r\nfirst sensation of delight here was at finding myself standing on\r\nHennepin Avenue. To a reader of Parkman's histories, the spot was\r\nclassic.... To refresh my own recollections, I had recourse to the\r\nPublic Library of the town, where I soon found Parkman's 'Discovery of\r\nthe Great West.' Armed with this volume, with the aid of a cheap and\r\nmiserable railroad map, I traced out something of the movements of those\r\nhardy French explorers. It was like living part of a romance, to look\r\nupon the skies and waters which had seen them wandering, suffering, yet\r\nundaunted....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_St. Paul_\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot rest so near St. Paul without visiting this famous city\r\nalso. I contemplate a trip in the cars, but my friendly host leaves his\r\nbusiness for a day, and drives me over in an open sleigh. I do not\r\nundertake this jaunt without Bostonian fears of death of cold, but\r\nMinnesota cold is highly stimulating, and with the aid of a bottle of\r\nhot water, I make the journey without a shiver.... Numbers of Indian\r\nsquaws from Mendota walk the streets in groups. I follow three of them\r\ninto a warehouse. One of them has Asiatic features--the others are\r\nrather pretty. They are Sioux. I speak to them, but they do not reply.\r\nThe owner of the warehouse asks what he can show me. I tell him that I\r\ndesire to see what the squaws will buy. He says that they buy very\r\nlittle, except beads, and have only come into the store to warm\r\nthemselves. They smile, and obviously understand English. We dine at the\r\nhotel, a very pleasant one. There is no printed bill of fare, but the\r\nwaiter calls off 'beefsteak, porksteak,' etc., and we make a comfortable\r\nmeal. I desire to purchase some dried buffalo meat, and find some, not\r\nwithout difficulty, as the season for selling it is nearly over. The\r\ncrowning romance of the day is a sleighride of five miles on the\r\nMississippi, giving us a near view of its fluted bluffs and numerous\r\nislets. We visit also the Falls of Minnehaha, now sheeted in ice, but\r\nvery beautiful, even in this disguise. We talk of 'Hiawatha,' and my\r\ncompanion says, 'If Mr. Longfellow had ever seen a Sioux Indian, he\r\nwould not have written \"Hiawatha.\"' The way to the bottom of the falls\r\nis so slippery with ice that I conclude not to attempt it. The day,\r\nwhich was one of great exposure, passed in great pleasure, and without\r\nchill or fatigue....\r\n\r\n\"In my days of romance, I remember watching late one night on board the\r\nMediterranean steamer in order to be sure of the moment in which we\r\nshould pass beyond the boundaries of the Italian shore. Something like\r\nsuch a feeling of interest and regret came over me when, in the unpoetic\r\n_sleeper_, I asked at what hour of the night the cars would pass out of\r\nMinnesota on the way back to Chicago. This sincere testimony from a\r\nveteran of travel, in all sorts, will perhaps convince those who do not\r\nknow the young State that she has a great charm of beauty and of\r\nclimate, besides a great promise of future prosperity and eminence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Kansas_\r\n\r\n\"Travel in Minnesota was living romance. Travel in Kansas is living\r\nhistory. I could not cross its borders, new as these are, without\r\nunlocking a volume of the past, written in blood and in prayer, and\r\nsealed with the forfeit of noble lives. A ghostly army of warriors\r\nseemed to escort me as I entered the fair, broad territory. John Brown,\r\nthe captain of them, stretched his hand to the Capitol, and Sumner, and\r\nAndrew, and Howe were with him. Here was the stand made, here the good\r\nfight begun, which, before it was well under way, divided the thought\r\nand sentiment of Europe, as well as those of America.\r\n\r\n\"My tired spirit sought to shake off at this point the commonplace sense\r\nof weariness and annoyance. To be in Kansas, and that for work, not for\r\npastime. To bring the woman's word where the man's rough sword and spade\r\nhad once wrought together, this was poetry, not prose. To be cold, and\r\nhungry, and worn with journeying, could not efface the great interest\r\nand pleasure....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Atchison_\r\n\r\n\"I was soon told that a gentleman was anxious to speak with me\r\nconcerning my land at Grasshopper, which borders immediately upon his\r\nown. Judge Van Winkle accordingly, with due permission, waited upon me,\r\nand unfolded his errand. Grasshopper, he said, was a growing place. It\r\npossessed already a store and an apothecary. It had now occasion for a\r\nschoolhouse, and one corner of my land offered the most convenient place\r\nfor such an institution. The town did not ask me to give this land--it\r\nwas willing to pay a fair price for the two acres wanted. Wishing to\r\nlearn a little more about the township, I asked whether it possessed the\r\nrequisite variety of creeds.\r\n\r\n\"'Have you a Baptist, a Methodist, an Episcopalian, and a Universalist\r\nchurch?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' said my visitor, 'we have no church at all. People who wish to\r\npreach can do so in some private house.' I afterwards learn that Judge\r\nVan Winkle is a student of Plato; who knows what may be his Hellenic\r\nheresy? He is endorsed, however, by others as a good, solid man, and the\r\nproposition for the schoolhouse receives my favorable consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Leavenworth_\r\n\r\n\"My first visit to Leavenworth was a stay of a couple of hours between\r\ntrains, on my way to southern Kansas. Short as this was, it yet brought\r\nto my acquaintance two new friends, and to my remembrance two old ones.\r\nOf the new friends, the first seen was Rev. Edward Sanborn, the\r\nUnitarian minister of the place. Mr. Sanborn met me at the comfortless\r\ndepot, and insisted upon taking me to his lodgings, where Friend Number\r\nTwo, in the shape of his amiable wife, added herself to the list of my\r\nwell-wishers. Mr. Sanborn had just been burned out. His house took fire\r\nwhile he and his wife were spending Christmas Day with a neighbor, and\r\nburned so quickly that no article in it could be saved. He had found in\r\nthe ashes the charred remains of his manuscript sermons, and had good\r\nhope of being able to decipher them. As the pleasant minutes passed in\r\neasy conversation, I could not help reflecting on the instinctive\r\nhospitality of Western life. This cosy corner in a mere hired bedroom\r\nhad given me a rest and a shelter which I should have been unwilling to\r\nask for in some streets of palaces which have been familiar to me from\r\nmy youth up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Association for the Advancement of Women was a pioneer society, and\r\ndid vital work for twenty-five years. During the greater part of that\r\ntime she was its president. She never missed (save when in Europe) one\r\nof its annual congresses, or one of the mid-year conferences (of\r\nofficers only) which she considered of high moment. She worked for the\r\nAssociation with a loving enthusiasm that never varied or faltered; and\r\nit was a real grief to her when the changing of the old order resolved\r\nit into its elements, to take new shape in the larger and\r\nfarther-reaching work of the General Federation of Clubs, and other\r\nkindred societies.\r\n\r\nMany of these may be called the children of \"A.A.W.\" The greatest\r\nservice of the latter was in founding women's clubs throughout the\r\ncountry. Wherever they went, to conferences or conventions, its leaders\r\ncalled about them the thoughtful women of the neighborhood, and helped\r\nthem to plan local associations for study and work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was still another aspect of the Woman Question, dearer to her even\r\nthan \"A.A.W.\"\r\n\r\nA woman minister once said: \"My conviction that Mrs. Howe was a divinely\r\nordained preacher was gained the first time that she publicly espoused\r\nthe question of woman suffrage in 1869.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen that little Julia Ward began her ministrations in the\r\nnursery. At eight years old she was adjuring her little cousin to love\r\nGod and he would see death approaching with joy. At eleven she was\r\nwriting her \"Invitation to Youth\":--\r\n\r\n  Oh! let thy meditations be of God,\r\n  Who guides thy footsteps with unerring eye;\r\n  And who, until the path of life is trod,\r\n  Will never leave thee by thyself to die.\r\n\r\n  When morning's rays so joyously do shine,\r\n  And nature brightens at the face of day,\r\n  Oh! think then on the joys that shall be thine\r\n  If thou wilt early walk the narrow way.\r\n\r\nWe have followed her through the Calvinistic period of religious gloom\r\nand fervor; through the intellectual awakening that followed; through\r\nthe years when she could say to Philosophy,--\r\n\r\n          \"... The world its plenitude\r\n  May keep, so I may share thy beggary.\"\r\n\r\nThese various phases were like divers-colored shades covering a lamp:\r\nthrough them all the white flame of religion burned clear and steady,\r\nfostered by a natural piety which was as much a part of her as the\r\nbreath she drew.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1865 came the call to preach. She was asked to speak before\r\nthe Parker Fraternity in Boston. She chose for her discourse a paper on\r\n\"Ideal Causation,\" which she had thought \"the crown of her endeavor\r\nhitherto.\"\r\n\r\n\"To my sorrow, I found that it did not greatly interest my hearers, and\r\nthat one who was reported to have wondered 'what Mrs. Howe was driving\r\nat' had spoken the mind of many of those present.\r\n\r\n\"I laid this lesson much to heart, and, becoming convinced that\r\nmetaphysics did not supply the universal solvent for human evils, I\r\ndetermined to find a _pou sto_ nearer to the sympathies of the average\r\ncommunity, from which I might speak for their good and my own.\r\n\r\n\"From my childhood the Bible had been dear and familiar to me, and I now\r\nbegan to consider texts and sermons, in place of the transcendental webs\r\nI had grown so fond of spinning. The passages of Scripture which now\r\noccurred to me filled me with a desire to emphasize their wisdom by a\r\nreally spiritual interpretation. From this time on, I became more and\r\nmore interested in the religious ministration of women....\"\r\n\r\nHer first sermon was preached at Harrisburg in 1870. Then followed the\r\nsermons in Santo Domingo, and those of the Peace Crusade in London; from\r\nthis time, the Woman Ministry was one of the causes dearest to her\r\nheart. The Journal from now on contains many texts and notes for\r\nsermons.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, \"What the lost things are which the Son of Man came to save,\r\nlost values, lost jewels, darkened souls, scattered powers, lost\r\nopportunities.\"\r\n\r\nA year later: \"Preached in the afternoon at the South Portsmouth\r\nmeetinghouse. Text, 'I will arise and go unto my father,' Subject: 'The\r\nFatherhood of God.' I did as well as usual.... In the evening my text\r\nwas: 'Abide in me and I in you,' etc., but I was at one moment so\r\novercome with fatigue that the whole thread of my discourse escaped me.\r\nI paused for a moment, excused myself briefly to the congregation, and\r\nwas fortunate enough to seize the thread of my discourse again, and got\r\nthrough quite well. I felt this very much,--the fear of failure, I mean.\r\nThe fatigue was great and my brain felt it much. My dæmon told me\r\nbeforehand that I could not repeat this sermon and had better read it. I\r\nshall believe him next time. This is a difficult point, to know how far\r\nto trust the dæmon. He is not to be implicitly trusted, nor yet to be\r\nneglected. In these days I am forced to review the folly and\r\nshortcomings of my life. My riper reason shows me a sad record of\r\nfollies and of faults. I seem to sit by and listen sadly; no chastening\r\nfor the present is joyous but grievous.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday, September 29._ Reverend Mrs. Gustine to dine. I afterwards to\r\nchurch to hear her. A sweet woman, called of God, with a real power. Her\r\nvoice, manner, and countenance, most sweet and impressive. Intellection\r\nnot remarkable, I think, but tone, feeling, and effect very remarkable.\r\nNo one, I think, would doubt the reality of spiritual things after\r\nhearing her. I asked myself why I am not jealous of her, as she preaches\r\nfar more effectively than I do. Well, partly because I believe in my own\r\ngift, such as it is, and partly because what she does is natural,\r\ngenuine, and without pretence or pretension. Her present Society was\r\nmuch disturbed by strife when she was called to its care. No man, she\r\ntold me, could have united the opposing parties. A true woman could.\r\nThis shows me a work that women have to do in the Church as well as\r\nelsewhere. Where men cannot make peace, they can. Mrs. Gustine says that\r\nby my writings and example I have helped her a good deal. I am glad to\r\nhear this, but pray to do far better than I have yet done.... Thought\r\nmuch about Mrs. Gustine, who, without any of my training and culture,\r\ncan do what I cannot. I can also do what she cannot--think a subject\r\nout. She can only shadow and suggest, yet how powerful is the contact of\r\nher soul, and what a good power!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Saturday, October 26._ To Vineyard Haven to help Mr. Stevens with\r\nto-morrow's services.... Arrival rainy and dismal. Mission house lonely\r\nin a storm. Mr. S.'s young niece very capable and pleasant; did the\r\nhonors and took care of me. I was very hungry before supper, having had\r\nnothing since breakfast except a few chestnuts and a biscuit. Wondered\r\na little why I had come.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday, 27th._ Found out why I had come. Preached from text: 'Oh, that\r\nmen would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works,'\r\netc. Consider these wonderful works: the world we live in, a human body\r\nand brain, a human soul.\r\n\r\n\"_Evening._ 'The ministry of reconciliation,' how Christianity\r\nreconciles man to God, nature to spirit, men to each other.\r\n\r\n\"I went through the two services entirely alone. I felt supported and\r\nheld up. I had hoped and prayed this journey might bring some special\r\ngood to some one. It brought great comfort to me....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 1873, after hearing a powerful sermon, she feels\r\nawakened to take up the work over which she has dreamed so much, and\r\ntalks with her friend, Mary Graves, herself an ordained minister of the\r\nUnitarian Church, about \"our proposed Woman's Mission here in Boston.\" A\r\nfew days later she writes: \"Determine that my Sunday services must be\r\nheld and to see Redpath[77] in this connection.\"\r\n\r\n  [77] Of the Redpath Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe result of this determination was the organization of the Woman's\r\nLiberal Christian Union, which held Sunday afternoon meetings through\r\nthe spring. She preached the first sermon, on March 16. \"I meant,\" she\r\nsays, \"to read my London sermon, but found it not suitable. Wrote a new\r\none as well as I could. Had a very good attendance. Was forced to play\r\nthe hymn tunes myself. Am thankful that the occasion seemed to meet\r\nwith acceptance.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1873, a number of women ministers having come to Boston to attend the\r\nMay Anniversaries, she conceived the idea of bringing them together in a\r\nmeeting all their own. She issued a call for a Woman Preachers'\r\nConvention, and this convention, the first held in any country, met on\r\nMay 29, 1873. She was elected president, the Reverends Mary H. Graves\r\nand Olympia Brown vice-presidents, Mrs. Bruce secretary. The Journal\r\ndescribes this meeting as \"most harmonious and happy.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1893, speaking of this time, she said:--\r\n\r\n\"I find that it is just twenty years, last spring, since I made the\r\nfirst effort to gather in one body the women who intended to devote\r\nthemselves to the ministry.\r\n\r\n\"The new liberties of utterance which the discussion of woman suffrage\r\nhad brought us seemed at this time not only to invite, but to urge upon\r\nus a participation in the advocacy of the most vital interests both of\r\nthe individual and of the community. With some of us, this advocacy\r\nnaturally took the form of preaching. Pulpits were offered us on all\r\nsides, and the charm of novelty lent itself to such merit and power as\r\nNature had vouchsafed us. I am so much of a natural church-woman, I\r\nmight say an ecclesiast, that I at once began to dream of a church of\r\ntrue womanhood. I felt how much the masculine administration of\r\nreligious doctrine had overridden us women, and I felt how partial and\r\none-sided a view of these matters had been inculcated by men, and handed\r\ndown by man-revering mothers. Now, I thought, we have got hold of what\r\nis really wanting in the Church universal. We need to have the womanly\r\nside of religion represented. Without this representation, we shall not\r\nhave the fulness of human thought for the things that most deeply\r\nconcern it. As a first step, I undertook to hold religious services on\r\nSunday afternoons, and to secure for them the assistance of as many\r\nwoman preachers as I could hear of. I had in this undertaking the\r\nassistance of my valued friend, Reverend Mary H. Graves.\"\r\n\r\nThe society thus formed was first called \"The Woman's Church,\" later,\r\n\"The Woman's Ministerial Conference.\" A second meeting was held, June 1,\r\n1874, but it was not till 1892 that this Conference was finally\r\norganized and established, to her great satisfaction. She was elected\r\nits president, and held the office till death.\r\n\r\nThe secretary, Reverend Ada C. Bowles, says of this Conference: \"As its\r\nmain object was to promote a sense of fellowship, rather than to expect\r\nassociated labor, owing to the scattered membership, meetings were not\r\nalways regularly held, or possible. But it has held together because\r\nMrs. Howe loved it, and had a secretary as loyal to her as she was to\r\nall the women ministers.\"\r\n\r\nShe herself has said: \"I was impressed with the importance of religious\r\nlife, and believed in the power of association. I believed that women\r\nministers would be less sectarian than men; and I thought that if those\r\nof different denominations could meet occasionally and compare notes, it\r\nwould be of value.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the formal conference, she welcomed the members at her own house,\r\ntalked with them, and heard of their doings. Her eyes kindled as she\r\nheard of the Wayside Chapel (of Malden, Massachusetts) built by its\r\npastor, Mrs. E. M. Bruce, who was also its trustee, janitor, choir, and\r\npreacher; heard how for thirteen years this lady had rung the bell every\r\nevening for vesper service, and had never lacked a congregation: or of\r\nthe other woman who was asked \"very diffidently\" if she would conduct\r\nthe funeral services of an honest and upright man who had died of drink,\r\nowing to an inherited tendency.\r\n\r\n\"They had expected to have it in the undertaker's rooms,\" said the\r\nReverend Florence Buck, of Wisconsin, \"but we had it in my own church.\r\nIt was packed with people of all sorts, who had been interested in him;\r\nand the Bartenders' Union were there in a body.... It was an opportunity\r\nthat I would not have given up to preach to the President and Senate of\r\nthe United States. Next day ... they said, 'We expected she'd wallop us\r\nto hell; but she talked to us like a mother!'\"\r\n\r\nThen she turned to the president, and said, \"The woman minister is often\r\nlonely. I want to thank Mrs. Howe, who welcomed me at the beginning of\r\nmy ministry. Her hand-clasp has stayed with me ever since.\"\r\n\r\nOur mother was never ordained: it is doubtful whether she ever\r\ncontemplated such a step; but she felt herself consecrated to the work;\r\nwherever she was asked to preach, she went as if on wings, feeling this\r\ncall more sacred than any other. She preached in all parts of the\r\ncountry, from Maine to California, from Minnesota to Louisiana; but the\r\npulpit in which she felt most truly at home was that of the Church of\r\nthe Disciples. Mr. Clarke had first welcomed her there: his successor,\r\nCharles Gordon Ames, became in turn her valued friend and pastor.\r\n\r\nThe congregation were all her friends. On Sundays they gathered round\r\nher after service, with greetings and kind words. She was ready enough\r\nto respond. \"Congregationing,\" as she called this little function, was\r\nher delight; after listening devoutly to the sermon, there was always a\r\nreaction to her gayest mood. Her spirit came to church with folded hands\r\nof prayer, but departed on dancing feet. Sometimes she reproached\r\nherself with over-friskiness; but mostly she was too wise for this, and\r\nlet the sun shine when and where it would.\r\n\r\nShe preached many times in the Church of the Disciples. The white-clad\r\nfigure, the clasped hands, the upturned face shining with the inner\r\nlight, will be remembered by some who read these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  JULIA WARD HOWE\r\n\r\n  1819-1910\r\n\r\n  VOLUME II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS VOLUME II\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.

W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Doctor's death till her marriage in 1887, the\r\nyoungest daughter was her mother's companion and yoke-fellow. In all\r\nrecords of travel, of cheer, of merriment, she can say thankfully: \"_Et\r\nego in Arcadia vixi_.\"\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1877 found the elder comrade weary with much lecturing and\r\npresiding, the younger somewhat out of health. Change of air and scene\r\nwas prescribed, and the two sailed for Europe early in May.\r\n\r\nThroughout the journeyings which followed, our mother had two objects in\r\nview: to see her own kind of people, the seekers, the students, the\r\nreformers, and their works; and to give Maud the most vivid first\r\nimpression of all that would be interesting and valuable to her. These\r\nobjects were not always easy to combine.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days at Chester (where she laments the \"restoration\" of the\r\nfine old oak of the cathedral, \"now shining like new, after a boiling in\r\npotash\") and a glimpse of Hawarden and Warwick, they proceeded to London\r\nand took lodgings in Bloomsbury (a quarter of high fashion when she\r\nfirst knew London, now given over to lodgings). Once settled, she lost\r\nno time in establishing relations with friends old and new. The\r\nUnitarian Association was holding its annual conference; one of the\r\nfirst entries in the Journal tells of her attending the Unitarian\r\nbreakfast where she spoke about \"the poor children and the Sunday\r\nschools.\"\r\n\r\nAmong her earliest visitors was Charles Stewart Parnell, of whom she\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Delia Stewart Parnell, whom I had known in America, had given me a\r\nletter of introduction to her son, Charles, who was already conspicuous\r\nas an advocate of Home Rule for Ireland. He called upon me and appointed\r\na day when I should go with him to the House of Commons. He came in his\r\nbrougham and saw me safely deposited in the ladies' gallery. He was then\r\nat the outset of his stormy career, and his sister Fanny told me that he\r\nhad in Parliament but one supporter of his views, 'a man named Biggar.'\r\nHe certainly had admirers elsewhere, for I remember having met a\r\ndisciple of his, O'Connor by name, at a 'rout' given by Mrs. Justin\r\nMcCarthy. I asked this lady if her husband agreed with Mr. Parnell. She\r\nreplied with warmth, 'Of course; we are all Home Rulers here.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_May 26._ To Floral Hall concert, where heard Patti--and many others--a\r\ngood concert. In the evening to Lord Houghton's, where made acquaintance\r\nof Augustus Hare, author of 'Memorials of a Quiet Life,' etc., with Mrs.\r\nProctor, Mrs. Singleton [Violet Fane], Dr. and Mrs. Schliemann, and\r\nothers, among them Edmund Yates. Lord Houghton was most polite and\r\nattentive. Robert Browning was there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhistler was of the party that evening. His hair was then quite black,\r\nand the curious white forelock which he wore combed high like a feather,\r\ntogether with his striking dress, made him one of the most conspicuous\r\nfigures in the London of that day. Henry Irving came in late: \"A rather\r\nawkward man, whose performance of 'Hamlet' was much talked of at that\r\ntime.\" She met the Schliemanns often, and heard Mrs. Schliemann speak\r\nbefore the Royal Geographical Society, where she made a plea for the\r\nmodern pronunciation of Greek. In order to help her husband in his work,\r\nMrs. Schliemann told her, she had committed to memory long passages from\r\nHomer which proved of great use to him in his researches at Mycenæ and\r\nTiryns.\r\n\r\n\"_May 27...._ Met Mr. and Mrs. Wood--he has excavated the ruins at\r\nEphesus, and has found the site of the Temple of Diana. His wife has\r\nhelped him in his work, and having some practical experience in the use\r\nof remedies, she gave much relief to the sick men and women of the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 2._ Westminster Abbey at 2 P.M. ... I enjoyed the service,\r\nMendelssohn's 'Hymn of Praise,' Dean Stanley's sermon, and so on, very\r\nunusually. Edward Twisleton seemed to come back to me, and so did dear\r\nChev, and a spiritual host of blessed ones who have passed within the\r\nveil....\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 14._ Breakfast with Mr. Gladstone. Grosvenor Gallery with the\r\nSeeleys. Prayer meeting at Lady Gainsborough's.\r\n\r\n\"We were a little early, for Mrs. Gladstone complained that the flowers\r\nordered from her country seat had but just arrived. A daughter of the\r\nhouse proceeded to arrange them. Breakfast was served at two round\r\ntables, exactly alike.\r\n\r\n\"I was glad to find myself seated between the great man and the Greek\r\nminister, John Gennadius. The talk ran a good deal upon Hellenics, and I\r\nspoke of the influence of the Greek in the formation of the Italian\r\nlanguage, to which Mr. Gladstone did not agree. I know that scholars\r\ndiffer on the point, but I still retain the opinion I expressed. I\r\nventured a timid remark regarding the number of Greek derivatives used\r\nin our common English speech. Mr. Gladstone said very abruptly, 'How?\r\nWhat? English words derived from Greek?' and almost\r\n\r\n  'Frightened Miss Muffet away.'\r\n\r\n\"He is said to be habitually disputatious, and I thought that this must\r\ncertainly be the case; for he surely knew better than most people how\r\nlargely and familiarly we incorporate the words of Plato, Aristotle, and\r\nXenophon in our everyday talk.\"[78]\r\n\r\n  [78] _Reminiscences_, pp. 411 and 412.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was still playing the first rôle on the stage of London\r\nlife. Our mother notes hearing him open the discussion that followed\r\nMrs. Schliemann's address before the Royal Geographical Society. Lord\r\nRosebery, who was at that time Mr. Gladstone's private secretary, talked\r\nmuch of his chief, for whom he expressed impassioned devotion. Rosebery,\r\nthough he must have been a man past thirty at the time, looked a mere\r\nboy. His affection for \"Uncle Sam\" Ward was as loyal as that for his\r\nchief, and it was on his account that he paid our mother some attention\r\nwhen she was in London.\r\n\r\nShe always remembered this visit as one of the most interesting of the\r\nmany she made to the \"province in brick.\" She was driving three horses\r\nabreast,--her own life, Maud's life, the life of London. She often spoke\r\nof the great interest of seeing so many different circles of London\r\nsociety; likening it to a layer cake, which a fortunate stranger is able\r\nto cut through, enjoying a little of each. Her modest Bloomsbury\r\nlodgings were often crowded by the leaders of the world of letters,\r\nphilanthropy, and art, and some even of the world of fashion. The little\r\nlodging-house \"slavey\" was often awed by the titles on the cards she\r\ninvariably presented between a work-worn thumb and finger. It is\r\ncurious to contrast the brief record of these days with that of the\r\nPeace Crusade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_June 10._ To morning service at the Foundling Hospital--very touching.\r\nTo luncheon with M. G. D. where met the George Howards.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 15...._ 'Robert' [opera] with Richard Mansfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 18._ Synagogue.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 19._ Lord Mayor's Mansion House. I am to speak there concerning\r\nLaura Bridgman. Henry James may come to take me to St. Bart.'s\r\nHospital.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 25._ 'Messiah.' Miss Bryce.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 26._ Dined with Capt. Ward. Theatre. Justin McCarthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 28._ Meeting in Lambeth Library.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 29._ Russell Gurney's garden party.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Marston's, Onslow Sq., 4 P.M. Anti-vivisection. Met Dudley\r\nCampbell. A day of rest, indeed. I wrote out my anti-vivisection\r\nargument for to-morrow, and finished the second letter to the Chicago\r\n'Tribune.' Was thus alone nearly all day. Dined at Brentini's in my old\r\nfashion, chop, tea, and beer, costing one shilling and fivepence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe remembered with pleasure an evening spent with the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Devonshire at Devonshire House. A ball at Mr. Goschen's was another\r\nevening of enchantment, as was also the dinner given for her at\r\nGreenwich by Edmund Yates, where she had a good talk with Mr. Mallock,\r\nwhose \"New Republic\" was one of the books of that season. She managed,\r\ntoo, sometimes to be at home; among her visitors were William Black,\r\nJohn Richard Green, and Mr. Knowles, editor of the \"Nineteenth Century.\"\r\n\r\nThe London visit lasted nearly two months; as the engagements multiply,\r\nits records grow briefer and briefer. There are many entries like the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast with Lord Houghton, where met Lord Granville and M.\r\nWaddington, late Minister of Education in France. Garden party at\r\nChiswick in the afternoon. Prince of Wales there with his eldest son,\r\nPrince Albert Victor. Mrs. Julian Goldsmith's ball in the evening.\"\r\n\r\nIt is remembered that she bravely watched the dancers foot it through\r\nthe livelong night, and drove home by daylight, with her \"poor dancing\r\nMaud\"!\r\n\r\nMadame Waddington was formerly Miss King, the granddaughter of Mr.\r\nWard's old partner. Our mother was always interested in meeting any\r\ndescendants of Prime, Ward & King.\r\n\r\nWith all this, she was writing letters for the Chicago \"Tribune\" and the\r\n\"Woman's Journal.\" This year of 1877 saw the height of the Æsthetic\r\nmovement. Mrs. Langtry, the \"Jersey Lily,\" was the beauty and toast of\r\nthe season. Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Patience\" was the dramatic hit of\r\nthe year, and \"Greenery yallery, Grosvenor Gallery\" the most popular\r\ncatch of the day.\r\n\r\nShe found it hard to tear herself away from England; the visit (which\r\nshe likened to one at the house of an adored grandmother) was over all\r\ntoo soon. But July was almost gone; and the two travellers finally left\r\nthe enchanted island for Holland, recalling Emerson's advice to one\r\ngoing abroad for the first time: \"A year for England, and a year for the\r\nrest of the world!\"\r\n\r\nThe much neglected Journal now takes up the story.\r\n\r\nThe great Franz Hals pictures delighted her beyond measure. She always\r\nbought the best reproductions she could afford, and valued highly an\r\netching that she owned from his Bohémienne. She never waited for any\r\nauthority to admire either a work of art or a person. She had much to\r\nsay about the influence of the Dutch blood both in our own family and in\r\nour country, which was to her merely a larger family connection. All\r\nthrough Holland she was constantly noting customs and traditions which\r\nwe seemed to have inherited; and she felt a great likeness and sympathy\r\nbetween herself and some of the Dutch people she knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The Hague._ To the old prison where the instruments of torture are\r\npreserved. The prison itself is so dark and bare that to stay therein\r\nwas a living death. To this was often added the most cruel torture. The\r\npoor wretch was stretched on a cross, on which revolving wheels, turned\r\nby a crank, agonized and destroyed his spinal column--or, by another\r\nmachine, his head and feet were drawn in opposite directions--or, his\r\nlimbs were stretched out and every bone broken with an iron bar.\r\nTortures of fire and water were added. Through all these horrors, I saw\r\nthe splendors of faith and conscience which illuminated these dungeons,\r\nand which enabled frail humanity to bear these inflictions without\r\nflinching.\"\r\n\r\nShe always wanted to see the torture chambers. She listened to all the\r\ndetailed explanations and looked at all the dreadful instruments, buoyed\r\nup by the thought of the splendors she speaks of, when mere shrinking\r\nflesh-and-blood creatures like her companion, who only thought of the\r\npoor tortured bodies, could not bear the strain of it.\r\n\r\nFrom The Hague they went to Amsterdam, where they \"worked hard at seeing\r\nthe rich museum, which contains some of the largest and best of\r\nRembrandt's pictures, and much else of interest\"; thence to Antwerp.\r\nHere she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"To the Museum, where saw the glorious Rubens and Van Dycks, together\r\nwith the Quentin Matsys triptych. Went to the Cathedral, and saw the\r\ndear Rubens pictures--my Christ in the Elevation of the Cross seemed to\r\nme as wonderful as ever. The face asks, 'Why hast thou forsaken me?' but\r\nseems also to reflect the answer, from the very countenance of the\r\nFather. Education of the Virgin by Rubens--angels hold a garland above\r\nthe studious head of the young Madonna. This would be a good picture for\r\nVassar.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday, July 29._ Up betimes--to high mass at the Cathedral. Had a\r\nseat near the Descent, and saw it better than ever before. Could not see\r\nthe Elevation so well, but feasted my eyes on both. Went later to the\r\nchurch of St. Paul where Rubens's Flagellation is. Found it very\r\nbeautiful. At 4 P.M. M. Félu[79] came to take us to the Zoo, which is\r\nuncommonly good. The collection of beasts from Africa is very rich. They\r\nare also successful in raising wild beasts, having two elephants, a\r\ntiger, and three giraffes which have been born in the cages--some young\r\nlions also. The captive lioness always destroyed her young, and these\r\nwere saved by being given to a dog to nurse....\"\r\n\r\n  [79] The armless painter. See _ante_, vol. I, chap. XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust found the travellers in Prussia.\r\n\r\n\"Passed the day in Berlin.... At night took railroad for Czerwinsk,\r\ntravelling second-class. After securing our seats, as we supposed, we\r\nleft the cars to get some refreshments, when a man and a woman displaced\r\nour effects, and took our places. The woman refused to give me my place,\r\nand annoyed me by pushing and crowding me.\"\r\n\r\nThe brutality of this couple was almost beyond belief. She was always so\r\ngracious to fellow-travellers that they usually \"made haste to be kind\"\r\nin return. She made it a point to converse with the intelligent-looking\r\npeople she met, either in the train or at the _tables d'hôte_ then still\r\nin vogue. She talked with these chance acquaintances of their country or\r\ntheir profession. It was never mere idle conversation.\r\n\r\nThis journey across Europe was undertaken solely for the pleasure of\r\nseeing her sister, always her first object in visiting Europe. The bond\r\nbetween them was very strong, spite of the wide difference of their\r\nnatures and the dissimilarity of their interests. Mrs. Terry was now\r\nvisiting her eldest daughter, Annie Crawford, married to Baron Eric von\r\nRabé and living at Lesnian in German Poland. Baron Eric had served in\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War with distinction, had been seriously wounded,\r\nand obliged to retire from active service. Here was an entirely new\r\nsocial atmosphere, the most conservative in Europe. Even before the\r\ntravellers arrived, the shadow of formality had fallen upon them; for\r\nMrs. Terry had written begging that they would arrive by \"first-class\"!\r\nAt that time the saying was, \"Only princes, Americans, and fools travel\r\nfirst-class,\" and our mother's rule had been to travel second. The\r\njourney was already a great expense, and the added cost seemed to her\r\nuseless. Accordingly, she bought second-class tickets to a neighboring\r\nstation and first-class ones from there to Czerwinsk. This entailed\r\nturning out in the middle of the night and waiting an hour for the\r\nsplendid express carrying the stiff and magnificently upholstered\r\nfirst-class carriages, whose red plush seats and cushions were nothing\r\nlike so comfortable as the old grey, cloth-lined, second-class\r\ncarriages!\r\n\r\nStill, the travellers arrived looking as proud as they could, wearing\r\ntheir best frocks and bonnets. They travelled with the Englishwoman's\r\noutfit. \"Three suits. Hightum, tightum, and scrub.\" \"Hightum\" was for\r\nany chance festivity, \"tightum\" for the _table d'hôte_, \"scrub\" for\r\neveryday travelling. The question of the three degrees was anxiously\r\ndiscussed on this occasion; it was finally decided that only \"hightum\"\r\nwould come up to the Von Rabé standard.\r\n\r\n\"_August 4._ Arrived at Czerwinsk, where sister L. and Baron von Rabé\r\nmet us. He kissed my hand in a courtly manner. My sister looks well, but\r\nhas had a hard time. We drove to Lesnian where Annie von R. and her\r\nmother-in-law made us welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 9, Lesnian._ A quiet day at home, writing and some work. Tea\r\nwith Sister L. in the open air. Then went with Baron von Rabé to visit\r\nhis farm buildings, which are very extensive; not so nicely finished as\r\nwould be the case in America. We got many fleas in our clothes.... In\r\nthe evening the Baron began to dispute with me concerning the French and\r\nthe use and excellence of war, etc....\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 12._ Up early--to Czerwinsk and thence by Dirschau to\r\nMarienburg to see the famous Ritterschloss of the Teutonic Knights....\r\nMarien-Kirch.... Angel Michael weighing the souls, a triptych--the good\r\nin right wing received by St. Peter and clothed by angels, the wicked in\r\nthe other wing going down. The beautiful sheen of the Archangel--like\r\npeacock brightness--a devil with butterfly wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 14._ In the church yesterday we were shown five holes in a flat\r\ntombstone. They say that a parricide was buried beneath this stone, and\r\nthe fingers of his hand forced themselves through these holes. They\r\nshowed us this hand, dried, and hung up in a chapel. Here also we saw a\r\npiece of embroidery in fine pearls, formerly belonging to the Catholic\r\nservice, and worth thousands of dollars. Some very ancient priests'\r\ngarments, with Arabic designs, were said to have been brought from the\r\nEast by the Crusaders. An astronomic clock is shown in the church. The\r\nman who made it set about making another, but was made blind lest he\r\nshould do so. By and by, pretending that he must repair or regulate\r\nsomething in the clock, he so puts it out of order that it never goes\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"The amber-merchant--the felt shoes--views of America--the lecture--the\r\nBaltic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was enchanted with Dantzig. The ancient Polish Jews in their long\r\ncloth gabardines, with their hair dressed in two curls worn in front of\r\nthe ear and hanging down on either side of the face, showed her how\r\nShylock must have looked. She was far more interested in the relics of\r\nthe old Polish civilization than in the crude, brand-new Prussian régime\r\nwhich was replacing it; but this did not suit her hosts. The peasants\r\nwho worked on the estate were all Poles; the relations between them and\r\ntheir employer smacked strongly of serfdom. One very intelligent man,\r\nwho often drove her, was called Zalinski. It struck her that this man\r\nmight be related to her friend Lieutenant Zalinski, of the United States\r\nArmy. She asked him if he had any relatives in America. He replied that\r\na brother of his had gone to America many years before. He seemed deeply\r\ninterested in the conversation and tried once or twice to renew it. One\r\nof the family, who was driving with our mother at the time, managed to\r\nprevent any more talk about the American Zalinski, and when the drive\r\nwas over she was seriously called to account.\r\n\r\n\"Can you not see that it would be extremely unfortunate if one of our\r\nservants should learn that any relative of his could possibly be a\r\nfriend of one of our guests?\"\r\n\r\nShe was never allowed to see Zalinski again; on inquiring for him, she\r\nlearned that he had been sent to a fair with horses to sell. He did not\r\nreturn to Lesnian during the remainder of her stay.\r\n\r\nOne of the picturesque features of the visit was the celebration of\r\nBaron Eric's birthday. It was a general holiday, and no work was done on\r\nthe estate. After breakfast family and guests assembled in front of the\r\nold château; the baron, a fine, soldierly-looking man, his wife, the\r\nmost graceful of women, and the only daughter, a lovely little girl with\r\nthe well-chiselled Crawford features. The peasants, dressed in their\r\nbest, assembled in procession in the driveway; one by one, in order of\r\ntheir age or position, they came up the steps, presented the Baroness\r\nwith a bouquet, bent the knee and kissed the hand of Baron and Baroness.\r\nTo most of the guests the picture was full of Old-World romance and\r\ncharm. To one it was an offence. That the granddaughter of her father,\r\nthe child of her adored sister, should have been placed by fate in this\r\nfeudal relationship to the men and women by whose labor she lived\r\noutraged her democratic soul.\r\n\r\nThe Journal thus describes the days at Lesnian:--\r\n\r\n\"The Baron talked much last evening, first about his crops, then about\r\nother matters. He believes duelling to be the most efficient agency in\r\npromoting a polite state of society. Would kill any one whom he\r\nsuspected of great wrong much sooner than bring him to justice. The law,\r\nhe says, is slow and uncertain--the decision of the sword much more\r\neffectual. The present Government favors duelling. If he should kill\r\nsome one in a duel, he would have two months of imprisonment only. He\r\ndespises the English as a nation of merchants. The old German knights\r\nseem to be his models. With these barbarous opinions, he seems to be\r\npersonally an amiable and estimable man. Despises University education,\r\nin whose course he might have come in contact with the son of a\r\ncarpenter, or small shopkeeper--he himself went to a Gymnase, with sons\r\nof gentlemen....\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything in the Junkerschaft[80] bristles for another war. Oscar von\r\nRabé's room, in which I now write, contains only books of military\r\ndrill.\r\n\r\n  [80] The Prussian aristocracy.\r\n\r\n\"This day we visited the schoolhouse--session over, air of the room\r\nperfectly fetid. Schoolmaster, whom we did not see, a Pole--his sister\r\ncould speak no German. Tattered primers in German. Visited the Jew, who\r\nkeeps the only shop in Lesnian. Found a regular country assortment. He\r\nvery civil. _Gasthaus_ opposite, a shanty, with a beer-glass, coffee-cup\r\nand saucer rudely painted on its whitewashed boards. Shoemaker in a damp\r\nhovel, with mahogany furniture, quite handsome. He made me a salaam with\r\nboth hands raised to his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"We went to call upon Herr von Rohr, at Schenskowkhan--an extensive\r\nestate. I had put on my Cheney silk and my bonnet as a great parade.\r\nOur host showed us his house, his books and engravings--he has several\r\netchings by Rembrandt. Herr von Mechlenberg, public librarian of\r\nKönigsberg, a learned little old man, trotted round with us. We had\r\ncoffee and waffles. Mechlenberg considers the German tongue a very\r\nancient one, an original language, not patched up like French and\r\nEnglish, of native dialects mingled with Latin.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of her letters to the Chicago \"Tribune\" is a significant passage\r\nwritten from Lesnian:--\r\n\r\n\"Having seen in one of the Dantzig papers the announcement that a\r\ncertain Professor Blank would soon deliver a lecture upon America,\r\nshowing the folly of headlong emigration thither and the ill fortune\r\nwhich many have wrought for themselves thereby, one of us remarked to a\r\nDantziger that in such a lecture many untruths would probably be\r\nuttered. Our friend replied, with a self-gratulatory laugh, 'Ah, Madame!\r\nWe Germans know all about the women of America. A German woman is\r\ndevoted to her household, its care and management; but the American\r\nwomen all force their husbands to live in hotels in order that they may\r\nhave no trouble in housekeeping.'\"\r\n\r\nShe was as sensitive to criticism of her country as some people are to\r\ncriticism of their friends. Throughout her stay in Germany she suffered\r\nfrom the captious and provoking tone of the Prussian press about things\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nEven in the churches she met this note of unfriendliness. She took the\r\ntrouble to transcribe in her Journal an absurd newspaper story.\r\n\r\n  \"An American Woman of Business\r\n\r\n\"Some little time since, a man living near Niagara Falls had the\r\nmisfortune to fall from the bridge leading to Goat's Island. [Berlin\r\npaper says _Grat_ Island.] He was immediately hurried to the edge of the\r\nfearful precipice. Here, he was able to cling to a ledge of rock, and to\r\nsupport himself for half an hour, until his unavoidable fate overtook\r\nhim. A compassionate and excited multitude rushed to the shore, and into\r\nthe house, where the unhappy wife was forced to behold the death\r\nstruggle of her husband, lost beyond all rescue, this spot yielding the\r\nbest view of the scene of horror. The 'excellent' wife had too much\r\ncoolness to allow this opportunity of making money to escape her, but\r\ncollected from every person present one dollar for window rent.\r\n(Berliner _Fremdenblatt_, Sunday, August 26, 1877.)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stab was from a two-edged sword; she loved profoundly the great\r\nGerman writers and composers. She was ever conscious of the debt she\r\nowed to Germany's poets, philosophers, and musicians. Goethe had been\r\none of her earliest sources of inspiration, Kant her guide through many\r\ntroublous years; Beethoven was like some great friend whose hand had led\r\nher along the heights, when her feet were bleeding from the stones of\r\nthe valley. These were the Germans she knew; her Germany was theirs. Now\r\nshe came in contact with this new _Junker_ Germany, this harsh,\r\nmilitary, unlovely country where Bismarck was the ruling spirit, and\r\nVon Moltke the idol of the hour. It was a rough awakening for one who\r\nhad lived in the gentler Fatherland of Schiller and of Schubert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_August 31, Berlin._ Up early, and with carriage to see the review....\r\nA great military display. The Emperor punctual at 10. '_Guten Morgen!_'\r\nshouted the troops when he came. The Crown Princess on horseback with a\r\nblue badge, Hussar cap. The kettle-drum man had his reins hitched, one\r\non either foot, guiding his horse in this way, and beating his drums\r\nwith both hands....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crown Princess, later the Empress Frederick, daughter of Queen\r\nVictoria, and mother of the present German Emperor, was the honorary\r\ncolonel of the hussar regiment whose uniform she wore, with the addition\r\nof a plain black riding-skirt. Civilization owes this lady a debt that\r\ncannot be paid save in grateful remembrance. During the Franco-Prussian\r\nWar she frequently telegraphed to the German officers commanding in\r\nFrance, urging them to spare the works of art in the conquered country.\r\nThrough her efforts the studios of Rosa Bonheur and other famous\r\npainters escaped destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early part of September was spent in Switzerland. Chamounix filled\r\nthe travellers with delight. They walked up the Brevant, rode to the Mer\r\nde Glace on muleback. The great feature, however, of this visit to\r\nSwitzerland was the Geneva Congress, called by Mrs. Josephine Butler to\r\nprotest against the legalizing of vice in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At the Congress to-day--spoke in French.... I spoke of the two sides,\r\nactive and passive, of human nature, and of the tendency of the\r\neducation given to women to exaggerate the passive side of their\r\ncharacter, whereby they easily fall victims to temptation. Spoke of the\r\nexercise of the intellectual faculties as correcting these\r\ntendencies--education of women in America--progress made. Coeducation\r\nand the worthier relations it induces between young men and women. Said,\r\nwhere society thinks little of women, it teaches them to think little of\r\nthemselves. Said of marriage, that Milton's doctrine, 'He for God only,\r\nshe for God in him,' was partial and unjust. '_Ce Dieu, il faut le\r\nmettre entre les deux, de manière que chacun des deux appartienne\r\npremièrement à Dieu, puis tous les deux l'un à l'autre._'\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish to take up what Blank said to-day of the superiority of man. Woman\r\nbeing created second. That is no mark of inferiority. Shall say, this\r\ndoctrine of inequality very dangerous. Inferior position, inferior\r\neducation, legal status, etc. Doctrine of morality quite opposite. If\r\nwife patient and husband not, wife superior--if wife chaste, husband\r\nnot, wife superior. Each indispensable to each other, and to the whole.\r\nGentlemen, where would you have been if we had not cradled and tended\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Congress...._ Just before the end of the meeting Mr. Stuart came to me\r\nand said that Mrs. Butler wished me to speak for five minutes. After\r\nsome hesitation I said that I would try. Felt much annoyed at being\r\nasked so late. Went up to the platform and did pretty well in French.\r\nThe audience applauded, laughing a little at some points. In fact, my\r\nlittle speech was a decided success with the French-speaking part of the\r\naudience. Two or three Englishwomen who understood very little of it\r\nfound fault with me for occasioning laughter. To the banquet....\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 23._ This morning Mrs. Sheldon Ames and her brother came to\r\nask whether I would go to Germany on a special mission. Miss Bolte also\r\nwished me to go to Baden Baden to see the Empress of Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 24._ A conference of Swiss and English women at 11 A.M. A\r\nsister of John Stuart Mill spoke, like the other English ladies, in very\r\nbad French. '_Nous femmes_' said she repeatedly. She seemed a good\r\nwoman, but travelled far from the subject of the meeting, which was the\r\nwork to be done to carry out what the Congress had suggested. Mrs.\r\nBlank, of Bristol, read a paper in the worst French I ever heard.\r\n'_Ouvrager_' for '_travailler_' was one of her mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of some slight criticisms on the management of this Congress,\r\nshe was heart and soul in sympathy with its object; and until the last\r\nday of her life, never ceased to battle for the higher morality which at\r\nall costs protests against the legalizing of vice.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Geneva she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"To Ferney in omnibus. The little church with its inscription '_Deo\r\nerexit Voltaire_,' and the date.... I remember visiting Ferney with dear\r\nChev; remember that he did not wish me to see the model [of Madame Du\r\nChâtelet's monument] lest it should give me gloomy thoughts about my\r\ncondition--she died in childbirth, and the design represents her with\r\nher infant bursting the tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober found the travellers in Paris, the elder still intent on affairs\r\nof study and reform, the younger grasping eagerly at each new wonder or\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThere were meetings of the Academy of Fine Arts, the Institute of\r\nFrance, the Court of Assizes: teachers' meetings, too, and dinners with\r\ndeaconesses (whom she found a pleasant combination of cheerfulness and\r\ngravity), and with friends who took her to the theatre.\r\n\r\n\"To Palais de Justice. Court of Assizes--a young man to be condemned for\r\nan offence against a girl of ten or twelve, and then to be tried for\r\nattempt to kill his brother and brother-in-law....\r\n\r\n\"We were obliged to leave before the conclusion of the trial, but\r\nlearned that its duration was short, ending in a verdict of guilty, and\r\nsentence of death. In the days that followed our thoughts often visited\r\nthis unfortunate man in his cell, so young, apparently without\r\nfriends--his nearest relatives giving evidence against him, and, in\r\nfact, bringing the suit that cost his life. It seems less than Mosaic\r\njustice to put a man to death for a murder which, though attempted, was\r\nnot actually committed. A life for a life is the old doctrine. This is a\r\nlife for an attempt upon a life.\"\r\n\r\nAn essay on Paris, written soon after, recalls further memories. She\r\nvisited the French Parliament, and was surprised at the noise and\r\nexcitement which prevailed.\r\n\r\n\"The presiding officer agitates his bell again and again, to no purpose.\r\nHe constantly cries, in piteous tone: 'Gentlemen, a little silence, if\r\nyou please.'\"\r\n\r\nShe tells how \"one of the ushers with great pride pointed out Victor\r\nHugo in his seat,\" and says further:\r\n\r\n\"I have seen this venerable man of letters several times,--once in his\r\nown house.... We were first shown into an anteroom, and presently into a\r\nsmall drawing-room. The venerable viscount kissed my hand ... with the\r\ncourtesy belonging to other times. He was of middle height, reasonably\r\nstout. His eyes were dark and expressive, and his hair and beard were\r\nsnow-white. Several guests were present.... Victor Hugo seated himself\r\nalone upon a sofa, and talked to no one. While the rest of the company\r\nkept up a desultory conversation, a servant announced M. Louis Blanc,\r\nand our expectations were raised only to be immediately lowered, for at\r\nthis announcement Victor Hugo arose and withdrew into another room, from\r\nwhich we were able to hear the two voices in earnest conversation....\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 27._ Packing to leave Paris to-night for Turin. The blanks\r\nleft in my diary do not mark idle days. I have been exceedingly busy,\r\n... have written at least five newspaper letters, and some other\r\ncorrespondence. Grieved this morning over the time wasted at shop\r\nwindows, in desiring foolish articles which I could not afford to buy,\r\nespecially diamonds, which I do not need for my way of life. Yet I have\r\nhad more good from my stay in Paris than this empty Journal would\r\nindicate. Have seen many earnest men and women--have delivered a lecture\r\nin French--have started a club of English and American women students,\r\nfor which _Deo gratias!_ Farewell, dear Paris, God keep and save thee!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe mentions this club in the \"Reminiscences.\" \"I found in Paris a\r\nnumber of young women, students of art and medicine, who appeared to\r\nlead very isolated lives and to have little or no acquaintance with one\r\nanother. The need of a point of social union for these young people\r\nappearing to me very great, I invited a few of them to meet me at my\r\nlodgings. After some discussion we succeeded in organizing a small club,\r\nwhich, I am told, still exists.... [If we are not mistaken, this small\r\nclub was a mustard seed which in time grew into the goodly tree of the\r\nAmerican Girls' Club.] I was invited several times to speak while in\r\nParis.... I spoke in French without notes.... Before leaving Paris I was\r\ninvited to take part in a congress of woman's rights. It was deemed\r\nproper to elect two presidents for this occasion, and I had the honor of\r\nbeing chosen as one of them....\r\n\r\n\"Somewhat in contrast with these sober doings was a ball given by the\r\nartist Healy at his residence. I had told Mrs. Healy in jest that I\r\nshould insist upon dancing with her husband. Soon after my entrance she\r\nsaid to me, 'Mrs. Howe, your quadrille is ready for you. See what\r\ncompany you are to have.' I looked and beheld General Grant and M.\r\nGambetta, who led out Mrs. Grant, while her husband had Mrs. Healy for\r\nhis partner in the quadrille of honor.... Marshal MacMahon was at this\r\ntime President of the French Republic. I attended an evening reception\r\ngiven by him in honor of General and Mrs. Grant. Our host was supposed\r\nto be at the head of the Bonapartist faction, and I heard some rumors of\r\nan intended _coup d'état_ which should bring back imperialism and place\r\nPlon-Plon [the nickname for Prince Napoleon] on the throne.... I\r\nremember Marshal MacMahon as a man of medium height, with no very\r\ndistinguishing feature. He was dressed in uniform and wore many\r\ndecorations.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this visit to Paris, our mother consorted largely with the men\r\nand women she had met at the Geneva Congress. She takes leave of Paris\r\nwith these words: \"Better than the filled trunk and empty purse, which\r\nusually mark a return from Paris, will be a full heart and a hand\r\nclasping across the water another hand pure and resolute as itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two comrades journeyed southward by way of Turin, Milan, and Verona.\r\nOf the last place the Journal says:--\r\n\r\n\"Busy in Verona--first, amphitheatre, with its numerous cells, those of\r\nthe wild beasts wholesomely lighted and aired, those of the prisoners,\r\ndark and noisome and often without light of any kind.... Then to the\r\ntombs of the Scaligers--grim and beautiful. Can Signoria who killed his\r\nbrother was the last. Can Grande, Dante's host.\"\r\n\r\nIn Verona she was full of visions of the great poet whose exile she\r\ndescribes in the poem called, \"The Price of the Divina Commedia.\" One\r\nwho met her there remembers the extraordinary vividness of her\r\nimpressions. It was as if she had seen and talked with Dante, had heard\r\nfrom his own lips how hard it was to eat the salt and go up and down the\r\nstairs of others.\r\n\r\nFrom Verona to Venice, thence to Bologna. Venice was an old friend\r\nalways revisited with delight. Bologna was new to her; here she found\r\ntraces of the notable women of its past. In the University she was shown\r\nthe recitation room where the beautiful female professor of anatomy is\r\nsaid to have given her lectures from behind a curtain, in order that the\r\nstudents' attention should not be distracted from her words of wisdom by\r\nher beauty. In the picture gallery she found out the work of Elisabetta\r\nSirani, one of the good painters of the Bolognese school.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after twenty-seven years, her road led once more to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA ROMAN WINTER\r\n\r\n1878-1879; _aet._ 59-60\r\n\r\nJANUARY 9, 1878\r\n\r\n  A voice of sorrow shakes the solemn pines\r\n  Within the borders of the Apennines;\r\n  A sombre vision veils the evening red,\r\n  A shuddering whisper says: the King is dead.\r\n\r\n        Low lies he near the throne\r\n  That strange desert and fortune made his own;\r\n  And at his life's completion, from his birth\r\n  In one fair record, men recount his worth.\r\n\r\n        Chief of the Vatican!\r\n  Heir of the Peter who his Lord denied,\r\n  Not of the faith which that offence might hide,\r\n  Boast not, \"I live, while he is coldly laid.\"\r\n  Say rather, in the jostling mortal race\r\n  He first doth look on the All-father's face.\r\n  Life's triple crown absolved weareth he,\r\n  Clear Past, sad Present, fond Futurity.\r\n\r\n                                          J. W. H.\r\n\r\nThe travellers arrived in Rome in good time for the Christmas dinner at\r\nPalazzo Odescalchi, where they found the Terrys and Marion Crawford. On\r\nDecember 31 our mother writes:--\r\n\r\n\"The last day of a year whose beginning found me full of work and\r\nfatigue. Beginning for me in a Western railway car, it ends in a Roman\r\npalace--a long stretch of travel lying between. Let me here record that\r\nthis year has brought me much good and pleasure, as well as some\r\nregrets. My European tour was undertaken for dear Maud's sake. It took\r\nme away from the dear ones at home, and from opportunities of work\r\nwhich I should have prized highly. I was President of the Woman's\r\nCongress, and to be absent not only from its meeting, but also from its\r\npreparatory work, caused me great regret. On the other hand, I saw\r\ndelightful people in England, and have seen, besides the old remembered\r\ndelights, many places which I never visited before.... I am now with my\r\ndear sister, around whom the shadows of existence deepen. I am glad to\r\nbe with her; though I can do so little for her, she is doing very much\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a season of extraordinary interest to one who had always loved\r\nItaly and pleaded for a generous policy toward her. Early in January it\r\nbecame known that King Victor Emanuel was dying. At the Vatican his\r\nlife-long adversary Pius IX was wasting away with a mortal disease. It\r\nwas a time of suspense. The two had fought a long and obstinate duel:\r\nwhich of them, people asked, would yield first to the conqueror on the\r\npale horse? There were those among the \"Blacks\" of Rome who would have\r\ndenied the last sacrament to the dying King. \"No!\" said Pio Nono; \"he\r\nhas always been a good Catholic; he shall not die without the\r\nsacrament!\" On the 9th of January the King died, and \"the ransomed land\r\nmourned its sovereign as with one heart.\"[81]\r\n\r\n  [81] _Reminiscences_, p. 423.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_January 12._ Have just been to see the new King [Umberto I] review the\r\ntroops, and receive the oath of allegiance from the army. The King's\r\nhorse was a fine light sorrel--he in full uniform, with light blue\r\ntrousers. In Piazza del Independenza. We at the American Consulate. Much\r\nacclamation and waving of handkerchiefs. Went at 5 in the afternoon to\r\nsee the dead King lying in state. His body was shown set on an inclined\r\nplane, the foreshortening disfigured his poor face dreadfully, making\r\nhis heavy moustache to look as if it were his eyebrows. Behind him a\r\nbeautiful ermine canopy reached nearly to the ceiling--below him the\r\ncrown and sceptre on a cushion. Castellani's beautiful gold crown is to\r\nbe buried with him.\"\r\n\r\nShe says of the funeral:--\r\n\r\n\"The monarch's remains were borne in a crimson coach of state, drawn by\r\nsix horses. His own favorite war-horse followed, veiled in crape, the\r\nstirrups holding the King's boots and spurs, turned backward. Nobles and\r\nservants of great houses in brilliant costumes, bareheaded, carrying in\r\ntheir hands lighted torches of wax.... As the cortège swept by, I\r\ndropped my tribute of flowers.[82]...\"\r\n\r\n  [82] _Reminiscences_, p. 423.\r\n\r\n\"_January 19._ To Parliament, to see the mutual taking of oaths between\r\nthe new King and the Parliament. Had difficulty in getting in. Sat on\r\ncarpeted stair near Mrs. Carson. Queen came at two in the afternoon. Sat\r\nin a loggia ornamented with red velvet and gold. Her entrance much\r\napplauded. With her the little Prince of Naples,[83] her son; the Queen\r\nof Portugal, her sister-in-law; and Prince of Portugal, son of the\r\nlatter. The King entered soon after two--he took the oath standing\r\nbareheaded, then signed some record of it. The oath was then\r\nadministered to Prince Amadeo and Prince de Carignan, then in\r\nalphabetical order to the Senate and afterwards to the Deputies.\"\r\n\r\n  [83] The present King, Victor Emanuel III.\r\n\r\nA month later, Pio Nono laid down the burden of his years. She says of\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\n\"Pope Pius IX had reigned too long to be deeply mourned by his spiritual\r\nsubjects, one of whom remarked in answer to condolence, 'I should think\r\nhe had lived long enough!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter passed swift as a dream, though not without anxieties. Roman\r\nfever was then the bane of American travellers, and while she herself\r\nsuffered only from a slight indisposition, Maud was seriously ill. There\r\nwas no time for her Journal, but some of the impressions of that\r\nmemorable season are recorded in verse.\r\n\r\n  Sea, sky, and moon-crowned mountain, one fair world,\r\n  Past, Present, Future, one Eternity.\r\n  Divine and human and informing soul,\r\n  The mystic Trine thought never can resolve.\r\n\r\nOne of the great pleasures of this Roman visit was the presence of her\r\nnephew Francis Marion Crawford. He was then twenty-three years old, and\r\nextremely handsome; some people thought him like the famous bas-relief\r\nof Antinous at the Villa Albano. The most genial and companionable of\r\nmen, he devoted himself to his aunt and was her guide to the\r\n_trattoria_ where Goethe used to dine, to Tasso's Oak, to the\r\ninnumerable haunts dedicated to the poets of every age, who have left\r\ntheir impress on the Eternal City.\r\n\r\nOur mother always loved acting. Her nearest approach to a professional\r\nappearance took place this winter. Madame Ristori was in Rome, and had\r\npromised to read at an entertainment in aid of some charity. She chose\r\nfor her selection the scene from \"Maria Stuart\" where the unhappy Queen\r\nof Scots meets Elizabeth and after a fierce altercation triumphs over\r\nher. At the last moment the lady who was to impersonate Elizabeth fell\r\nill. What was to be done? Some one suggested, \"Mrs. Howe!\" The\r\n\"Reminiscences\" tell how she was \"pressed into the service,\" and how the\r\nlast rehearsal was held while the musical part of the entertainment was\r\ngoing on. \"Madame Ristori made me repeat my part several times,\r\ninsisting that my manner was too reserved and would make hers appear\r\nextravagant. I did my best to conform to her wishes, and the reading was\r\nduly applauded.\"[84]\r\n\r\n  [84] _Reminiscences_, p. 425.\r\n\r\nAnother performance was arranged in which Madame Ristori gave the\r\nsleep-walking scene from \"Macbeth.\" The question arose as to who should\r\ntake the part of the attendant.\r\n\r\n\"Why not your sister?\" said Ristori to Mrs. Terry. \"No one could do it\r\nbetter!\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring, the travellers made a short tour in southern Italy. One\r\nmemory of it is given in the following verses:--\r\n\r\n\r\nNEAR AMALFI\r\n\r\n  Hurry, hurry, little town,\r\n  With thy labor up and down.\r\n  Clang the forge and roll the wheels,\r\n  Spring the shuttle, twirl the reels.\r\n            Hunger comes.\r\n\r\n  Every woman with her hand\r\n  Shares the labor of the land;\r\n  Every child the burthen bears,\r\n  And the soil of labor wears.\r\n            Hunger comes.\r\n\r\n  In the shops of wine and oil\r\n  For the scanty house of toil;\r\n  Give just measure, housewife grave,\r\n  Thrifty shouldst thou be, and brave.\r\n            Hunger comes.\r\n\r\n  Only here the blind man lags,\r\n  Here the cripple, clothed with rags.\r\n  Such a motley Lazarus\r\n  Shakes his piteous cap at us.\r\n            Hunger comes.\r\n\r\n  Oh! could Jesus pass this way\r\n  Ye should have no need to pray.\r\n  He would go on foot to see\r\n  All your depths of misery.\r\n            Succor comes.\r\n\r\n  He would smooth your frowzled hair,\r\n  He would lay your ulcers bare,\r\n  He would heal as only can\r\n  Soul of God in heart of man.\r\n            Jesus comes.\r\n\r\n  Ah! my Jesus! still thy breath\r\n  Thrills the world untouched of death.\r\n  Thy dear doctrine showeth me\r\n  Here, God's loved humanity\r\n            Whose kingdom comes.\r\n\r\nThe summer was spent in France; in November they sailed for Egypt.\r\n\r\n\"_November 27, Egypt._ Land early this morning--a long flat strip at\r\nfirst visible. Then Arabs in a boat came on board. Then began a scene of\r\nunparalleled confusion, in the midst of which Cook's Arabian agent found\r\nme and got my baggage--helping us all through quietly, and with great\r\nsaving of trouble.... A drive to see Pompey's Pillar and obelisk. A walk\r\nthrough the bazaar. Heat very oppressive. Delightful drive in the\r\nafternoon to the Antonayades garden and villa.... Mr. Antonayades was\r\nmost hospitable, gave us great bouquets, and a basket of fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cairo._ Walked out. A woman swung up and down in a box is\r\nbrown-washing the wall of the hotel. She was drawn up to the top, quite\r\na height, and gradually let down. Her dress was a dirty blue cotton\r\ngown, and under that a breech-cloth of dirty sackcloth. We were to have\r\nhad an audience from the third Princess[85] this afternoon, and were\r\nnearly dressed for the palace when we were informed that the reception\r\nwould take place to-morrow, when there will be a general reception, it\r\nbeing the first day of Bairam. Visit on donkey-back to the bazaars, and\r\ngallop; sunset most beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n  [85] The favorite wife of the Khedive.\r\n\r\n\"Up early, and all agog for the palace. I wore my black velvet and all\r\nmy [few] diamonds, also a white bonnet made by Julia McAllister[86] and\r\ntrimmed with her lace and Miss Irwin's white lilacs. General Stone sent\r\nhis carriage with _sais_ richly dressed. Reception was at Abdin\r\nPalace--row of black eunuchs outside, very grimy in aspect. Only women\r\ninside--dresses of bright pink and yellow satin, of orange silk, blue,\r\nlilac, white satin. Lady in waiting in blue silk and diamonds. In the\r\nhall they made us sit down, and brought us cigarettes in gilt saucers.\r\nWe took a whiff, then went to the lady in waiting who took us into the\r\nroom where the three princesses were waiting to receive us. They shook\r\nhands with us and made us sit down, seating themselves also. First and\r\nsecond Princesses on a sofa, I at their right in a fauteuil, on my left\r\nthe third Princess. First in white brocaded satin, pattern very bright,\r\npink flowers with green leaves. Second wore a Worth dress of corn\r\nbrocade, trimmed with claret velvet; third in blue silk. All in\r\nstupendous diamonds. Chibouks brought which reached to the floor. We\r\nsmoke, I poorly,--mine was badly lighted,--an attendant in satin brought\r\na fresh coal and then the third Princess told me it was all right.\r\nCoffee in porcelain cups, the stands all studded with diamonds.\r\nConversation rather awkward. Carried on by myself and the third\r\nPrincess, who interpreted to the others. Where should we go from Cairo?\r\nUp the Nile, in January to Constantinople.\"\r\n\r\n  [86] A cousin who was of the party.\r\n\r\n\"Achmed took me to see the women dance, in a house where a wedding is\r\nsoon to take place. Dancing done by a one-eyed woman in purple and gold\r\nbrocade--house large, but grimy with dirt and neglect. Men all in one\r\nroom, women in another--several of them one-eyed, the singer blind--only\r\ninstruments the earthenware drum and castanets worn like rings on the\r\nupper joints of the fingers. Arab café--the story-teller, the\r\none-stringed violin....\"\r\n\r\n\"To the ball at the Abdin Palace. The girls looked charmingly. Maud\r\ndanced all the night. The Khedive[87] made me quite a speech. He is a\r\nshort, thickset man, looking about fifty, with grizzled hair and beard.\r\nHe wore a fez, Frank dress, and a star on his breast. Tewfik Pasha, his\r\nson and heir, was similarly dressed. Consul Farman presented me to both\r\nof them. The suite of rooms is very handsome, but this is not the finest\r\nof the Khedive's palaces. Did not get home much before four in the\r\nmorning. In the afternoon had visited the mosque of Sultan Abdul\r\nHassan....\"\r\n\r\n  [87] Ismail Pasha.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Cairo came a trip up the Nile, with all its glories and\r\ndiscomforts. Between marvel and marvel she read Herodotus and Mariette\r\nBey assiduously.\r\n\r\n\"_Christmas Day._ Cool wind. Native _reis_ of the boat has a brown\r\nwoollen capote over his blue cotton gown, the hood drawn over his\r\nturban. A Christmas service. Rev. Mr. Stovin, English, read the lessons\r\nfor the day and the litany. We sang 'Nearer, my God, to Thee,' and\r\n'Hark, the herald angels sing.' It was a good little time. My thoughts\r\nflew back to Theodore Parker, who loved this [first] hymn, and in whose\r\n'meeting' I first heard it. Upper deck dressed with palms--waiters in\r\ntheir best clothes....\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day visited Assiout, where we arrived soon after ten in the morning.\r\nDonkey-ride delightful, visit to the bazaar. Two very nice youths found\r\nus out, pupils of the American Mission. One of these said, 'I also am\r\nChristianity.' Christian pupils more than one hundred. Several Moslem\r\npupils have embraced Christianity.... This morning had a very sober\r\nseason, lying awake before dawn, and thinking over this extravagant\r\njourney, which threatens to cause me serious embarrassment.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n\"The last day of a year in which I have enjoyed many things, wonderful\r\nnew sights and impressions, new friends. I have not been able to do much\r\nuseful work, but hope to do better work hereafter for what this year has\r\nshown me. Still, I have spoken four times in public, each time with\r\nlabor and preparation--and have advocated the causes of woman's\r\neducation, equal rights and equal laws for men and women. My heart\r\ngreatly regrets that I have not done better, during these twelve months.\r\nMust always hope for the new year.\"\r\n\r\nThe record of the new year (1879) begins with the usual aspirations:--\r\n\r\n\"May every minute of this year be improved by me! This is too much to\r\nhope, but not too much to pray for. And I determine this year to pass no\r\nday without actual prayer, the want of which I have felt during the year\r\njust past. Busy all day, writing, washing handkerchiefs, and reading\r\nHerodotus.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 2, she \"visited Blind School with General Stone--Osny\r\nEffendi, Principal. Many trades and handicrafts--straw matting,\r\nboys--boys and girls weaving at hand loom--girls spinning wool and\r\nflax, crochet and knitting--a lesson in geography. Turning lathe--bought\r\na cup of rhinoceros horn.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 4 she is \"sad to leave Egypt--dear beautiful country!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Jerusalem, January 5._ I write in view of the Mount of Olives, which\r\nglows in the softest sunset light, the pale moon showing high in the\r\nsky. Christ has been here--here--has looked with his bodily eyes on this\r\nfair prospect. The thought ought to be overpowering--is inconceivable.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 9._ In the saddle by half past eight in the morning. Rode two\r\nhours, to Bethlehem. Convent--Catholic. Children at the school. Boy with\r\na fine head, Abib. In the afternoon mounted again and rode in sight of\r\nthe Dead Sea. Mountains inexpressibly desolate and grand. Route very\r\nrough, and in some places rather dangerous.... Grotto of the\r\nNativity--place of the birth--manger where the little Christ was laid.\r\nTomb of St. Jerome. Tombs of two ladies who were friends of the Saint.\r\nLater the plains of Boaz, which also [is] that where the shepherds heard\r\nthe angels. Encamped at Marsaba. Greek convent near by receives men\r\nonly. An old monk brought some of the handiwork of the brethren for\r\nsale. I bought a stamp for flat cakes, curiously cut in wood. We dined\r\nluxuriously, having a saloon tent and an excellent cook.... Good beds,\r\nbut I lay awake a good deal with visions of death from the morrow's\r\nride.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 10._ [In camp in the desert near Jericho.] 'Shoo-fly'[88]\r\nwaked us at half past five banging on a tin pan and singing 'Shoo-fly.'\r\nWe rose at once and I felt my terrors subside. Felt that only prayer and\r\ntrust in God could carry me through. We were in the saddle by seven\r\no'clock and began our perilous crossing of the hills which lead to the\r\nDead Sea. Scenery inexpressibly grand and desolate. Some frightful bits\r\nof way--narrow bridle paths up and down very steep places, in one place\r\na very narrow ridge to cross, with precipices on either side. I prayed\r\nconstantly and so felt uplifted from the abjectness of animal fear.\r\nAfter a while we began to have glimpses of the Dead Sea, which is\r\nbeautifully situated, shut in by high hills, quite blue in color. After\r\nmuch mental suffering and bodily fatigue on my part we arrived at the\r\nshores of the sea. Here we rested for half an hour, and I lay stretched\r\non the sands which were very clean and warm! Remounted and rode to\r\nJordan. Here, I had to be assisted by two men [they lifted her bodily\r\nout of the saddle and laid her on the ground] and lay on my shawl,\r\neating my luncheon in this attitude. Fell asleep here. Could not stop\r\nlong enough to touch the water. We rested in the shade of a clump of\r\nbushes, near the place where the baptism of Christ is supposed to have\r\ntaken place. Our cans were filled with water from this sacred stream,\r\nand I picked up a little bit of hollow reed, the only souvenir I could\r\nfind. Remounted and rode to Jericho. Near the banks of the Jordan we met\r\na storm of locusts, four-winged creatures which annoyed our horses and\r\nflew in our faces. John the Baptist probably ate such creatures.\r\nAfternoon ride much better as to safety, but very fatiguing. Reached\r\nJericho just after sunset, a beautiful camping-ground. After dinner, a\r\nBedouin dance, very strange and fierce. Men and women stood in a\r\nsemicircle, lighted by a fire of dry thorns. They clapped their hands\r\nand sang, or rather murmured, in a rhythm which changed from time to\r\ntime. A chief danced before them, very gracefully, threatening them with\r\nhis sword, with which he played very skilfully. They sometimes went on\r\ntheir knees as if imploring him to spare them. He came twice to our tent\r\nand waved the sword close to our heads, saying, '_Taih backsheesh_.' The\r\ndance was like an Indian war-dance--the chief made a noise just like the\r\nwar-whoop of our Indians. The dance lasted half an hour. The chief got\r\nhis backsheesh and the whole troop departed. Lay down and rested in\r\npeace, knowing that the dangerous part of our journey was over.\"\r\n\r\n  [88] A negro attendant.\r\n\r\n\"_In Camp in the Desert. January 11._ In the saddle by half past seven.\r\nRode round the site of ancient Jericho, of which nothing remains but\r\nsome portions of the king's highway. Ruins of a caravanserai, which is\r\nsaid to be the inn where the good Samaritan lodged his patient. Stopped\r\nfor rest and luncheon, at Beth--and proceeded to Bethany, where we\r\nvisited the tomb of Lazarus. I did not go in--then rode round the Mount\r\nof Olives and round the walls of Jerusalem, arriving at half past three\r\nin the afternoon. I became very stiff in my knees, could hardly be\r\nmounted on my horse, and suffered much pain from my knee and abrasions\r\nof the skin caused by the saddle. Did not get down at the tomb of\r\nLazarus because I could not have descended the steps which led to it,\r\nand could not have got on my horse again. When we reached our hotel, I\r\ncould not step without help, and my strength was quite exhausted. I say\r\nto all tourists, avoid Cook's dreadful hurry, and to all women, avoid\r\nMarsaba! This last day, we often met little troops of Bedouins\r\ntravelling on donkeys--sometimes carrying with them their cattle and\r\nhousehold goods. I saw a beautiful white and black lamb carried on a\r\ndonkey. Met three Bedouin horsemen with long spears. One of these\r\nstretched his spear across the way almost touching my face, for a joke.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Jerusalem. Sunday, January 12._ English service. Communion,\r\ninteresting here where the rite was instituted. I was very thankful for\r\nthis interesting opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 15._ Mission hospital and schools in the morning. Also\r\nSaladin's horse. Wailing place of the Jews and some ancient synagogues.\r\nIn the afternoon walked to Gethsemane and ascended the Mount of Olives.\r\nIn the first-named place, sang one verse of our hymn, 'Go to dark\r\nGethsemane.' Got some flowers and olive leaves....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Jerusalem came Jaffa, where she delivered an address to a \"circle\"\r\nat a private house. She says:--\r\n\r\n\"In Jaffa of the Crusaders, Joppa of Peter and Paul, I find an American\r\nMission School, kept by a worthy lady from Rhode Island. Prominent among\r\nits points of discipline is the clean-washed face, which is so enthroned\r\nin the prejudices of Western civilization. One of her scholars, a youth\r\nof unusual intelligence, finding himself clean, observes himself to be\r\nin strong contrast with his mother's hovel, in which filth is just kept\r\nclear of fever point. 'Why this dirt?' quoth he; 'that which has made me\r\nclean will cleanse this also.' So without more ado, the process of\r\nscrubbing is applied to the floor, without regard to the danger of so\r\ngreat a novelty. This simple fact has its own significance, for if the\r\ninnovation of soap and water can find its way to a Jaffa hut, where can\r\nthe ancient, respectable, conservative dirt-devil feel himself secure?\"\r\n\r\nApropos of mission work (in which she was a firm believer), she loved to\r\ntell how one day in Jerusalem she was surrounded by a mob of beggars,\r\nunwashed and unsavory, clamoring for money, till she was well-nigh\r\nbewildered. Suddenly there appeared a beautiful youth in spotless white,\r\nwho scattered the mob, took her horse's bridle, and in good English\r\noffered to lead her to her hotel. It was as if an angel had stepped into\r\nthe narrow street.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, dear youth?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"I am a Christian!\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nIn parting she says, \"Farewell, Holy Land! Thank God that I have seen\r\nand felt it! All good come to it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Palestine the way led to Cyprus (\"the town very muddy and bare of\r\nall interest\") and Smyrna, thence to Constantinople. Here she visited\r\nRobert College with great delight. Returning, she saw the \"Sultan going\r\nto Friday's prayers. A melancholy, frightened-looking man, pale, with a\r\nlarge, face-absorbing nose....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_February 3._ Early at Piræus. Kalopothakis[89] met us there, coming on\r\nboard.... To Athens by carriage. Acropolis as beautiful as ever. It\r\nlooks small after the Egyptian temples, and of course more modern--still\r\nvery impressive....\"\r\n\r\n  [89] A Greek Protestant minister.\r\n\r\nAthens, with its welcoming faces of friends, seemed almost homelike\r\nafter the Eastern journeyings. The Journal tells of sight-seeing for the\r\nbenefit of the younger traveller, and of other things beside.\r\n\r\n\"Called on the _Grande Maîtresse_ at the Palace in order to have cards\r\nfor the ball. Saw the Schliemann relics from Mycenæ, and the wonderful\r\nmarbles gathered in the Museum. Have been writing something about these.\r\nTo ball at the palace in my usual sober rig, black velvet and so forth.\r\nQueen very gracious to us.... Home by three in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 12._ At ten in the morning came a committee of Cretan\r\nofficers of the late insurrection, presenting a letter through Mr.\r\nRainieri, himself a Cretan, expressing the gratitude of the Cretans to\r\ndear Papa for his efforts in their behalf.... Mr. Rainieri made a\r\nsuitable address in French--to which I replied in the same tongue.\r\nCoffee and cordial were served. The occasion was of great interest....\r\nIn the afternoon spoke at Mrs. Felton's of the Advancement of Women as\r\npromoted by association. An American dinner of perhaps forty, nearly all\r\nwomen, Greek, but understanding English. A good occasion. To party at\r\nMadame Schliemann's.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 15._ Miserable with a cold. A confused day in which nothing\r\nseemed to go right. Kept losing sight of papers and other things. Felt\r\nas if God could not have made so bad a day--my day after all; I made\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 18._ To ball at the Palace. King took Maud out in the\r\nGerman.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 21._ The day for eating the roast lamb with the Cretan\r\nchiefs. Went down to the Piræus warmly wrapped up.... Occasion most\r\ninteresting. Much speech-making and toasting. I mentioned Felton.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 22._ Dreadful day of departure. Packed steadily but with\r\nconstant interruptions. The Cretans called upon me to present their\r\nphotographs and take leave. Tried a poem, failed. Had black\r\ncoffee--tried another--succeeded....\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 23._ Sir Henry Layard, late English minister to the Porte, is\r\non board. Talked Greek at dinner--beautiful evening--night as rough as\r\nit could well be. Little sleep for any of us. Glad to see that Lord\r\nHartington has spoken in favor of the Greeks, censuring the English\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 26...._ Sir Henry Layard and I _tête-à-tête_ on deck, looking\r\nat the prospect--he coveting it, no doubt, for his rapacious country, I\r\ncoveting it for liberty and true civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring was spent in Italy. In May they came to London.\r\n\r\n\"_May 29._ Met Mr. William Speare.... He told me of his son's death, and\r\nof that of William Lloyd Garrison. Gallant old man, unique and enviable\r\nin reputation and character. Who, oh! who can take his place? 'Show us\r\nthe Father.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last weeks of the London visit were again too full for any adequate\r\naccount of them to find its way into her letters or journals. She\r\nvisited London once more in later years, but this was her last long\r\nstay. She never forgot the friends she made there, and it was one of the\r\nmany day-dreams she enjoyed that she should return for another London\r\nseason. Sometimes after reading the account of the gay doings chronicled\r\nin the London \"World,\" which Edmund Yates sent her as long as he lived,\r\nshe would cry out, \"O! for a whiff of London!\" or, \"My dear, we must\r\nhave another London season before I die!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nNEWPORT\r\n\r\n1879-1882; _aet._ 60-63\r\n\r\nA THOUGHT FOR WASHING DAY\r\n\r\n  The clothes-line is a Rosary\r\n    Of household help and care;\r\n  Each little saint the Mother loves\r\n    Is represented there.\r\n\r\n  And when across her garden plot\r\n    She walks, with thoughtful heed,\r\n  I should not wonder if she told\r\n    Each garment for a bead.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  A stranger passing, I salute\r\n    The Household in its wear,\r\n  And smile to think how near of kin\r\n    Are love and toil and prayer.\r\n\r\n                                    J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly, 1879, found our mother at home at Oak Glen, unpacking trunks and\r\nreading a book on the Talmud. She had met the three married daughters in\r\nBoston (\"We talked incessantly for seven hours,\" says the Journal), and\r\nFlorence and Maud accompanied her to Newport, where Florence had\r\nestablished her summer nursery. There were three Hall grandchildren now,\r\nand they became an important factor in the life at Oak Glen. All through\r\nthe records of these summer days runs the patter of children's feet.\r\n\r\nShe kept only one corner of the house for her private use; a room with\r\nthe north light which she then thought essential. This was at once\r\nbedroom and workroom: she never had a separate study or library. Here,\r\nas in Green Peace days, she worked quietly and steadily. Children and\r\ngrandchildren might fill the house, might have everything it contained:\r\nshe asked only for her \"precious time.\" When she could not have an hour\r\nshe took half an hour, a quarter, ten minutes. No fragment of time was\r\ntoo small for her to save, to invest in study or in work; and as her\r\nmind concentrated instantly on the subject in hand, no such fragment was\r\nwasted. The rule of mind over body was relentless: sick or well, she\r\nmust finish her stint before the day closed.\r\n\r\nThis summer of 1879 was a happy one. After the feverish months of travel\r\nand pleasure, her delight in the soft Newport climate was deeper than\r\never. She always felt the change from the air of the mainland to that of\r\nthe island, and never crossed the bridge from Tiverton to Bristol Ferry\r\nwithout an exclamation of pleasure. She used to say that the soft, cool\r\nair of Newport smoothed out the tired, tangled nerves \"like a silver\r\ncomb\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_July 29._ To my Club, where, better than any ovation, an affectionate\r\ngreeting awaited me.... Thucydides is very difficult.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the Town and Country Club, for some years a great interest to\r\nher. In her \"Reminiscences\" she tells how in a summer of the late\r\nsixties or early seventies, when Bret Harte and Dr. J. G. Holland,\r\nProfessors Lane and Goodwin of Harvard were spending the season at\r\nNewport: \"A little band of us combined to improve the beautiful summer\r\nseason by picnics, sailing parties, and household soirées, in all of\r\nwhich these brilliant literary lights took part. Helen Hunt and Kate\r\nField were often of our company, and Colonel Higginson was always with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the frolics of that summer was the mock Commencement, arranged by\r\nher and Professor Lane.\r\n\r\n\"I acted as President, Colonel Higginson as my aide; we both marched up\r\nthe aisle in Oxford caps and gowns. I opened the proceedings by an\r\naddress in Latin, Greek, and English; and when I turned to Colonel\r\nHigginson and called him '_fili mihi dilectissime_,' he wickedly replied\r\nwith three bows of such comic gravity that I almost gave way to\r\nunbecoming laughter. Not long before this he had published a paper on\r\nthe Greek goddesses. I therefore assigned as his theme the problem, 'How\r\nto sacrifice an Irish bull to a Greek goddess.' Colonel George Waring,\r\nthe well-known engineer, being at that time in charge of a valuable farm\r\nin the neighborhood, was invited to discuss 'Social small potatoes: how\r\nto enlarge their eyes.' An essay on rhinoscopy was given by Fanny Fern,\r\nthe which I, chalk in hand, illustrated on the blackboard by the\r\nfollowing equation:--\r\n\r\n  \"Nose + nose + nose = proboscis.\r\n  Nose - nose - nose = snub.\r\n\r\n\"A class was called upon for recitations from Mother Goose in seven\r\ndifferent languages. At the head of this Professor Goodwin honored us\r\nwith a Greek version of the 'Man in the Moon.' A recent Harvard\r\ngraduate, Dr. Gorham Bacon, recited the following, also of her\r\ncomposition:--\r\n\r\n  \"'Heu iterum didulum,\r\n  Felis cum fidulum,\r\n  Vacca transiluit lunam,\r\n  Caniculus ridet,\r\n  Quum tale videt,\r\n  Et dish ambulavit cum spoonam.'\r\n\r\n\"The question being asked whether this last line was in strict\r\naccordance with grammar, the scholar gave the following rule: 'The\r\nconditions of grammar should always give way to the exigencies of\r\nrhyme.'\r\n\r\n\"The delicious fooling of that unique summer was never repeated. Out of\r\nit came, however, the more serious and permanent association known as\r\nthe Town and Country Club of Newport. I felt the need of upholding the\r\nhigher social ideals and of not leaving true culture unrepresented, even\r\nin a summer watering-place.\"\r\n\r\nWith the help and advice of Professor and Mrs. William B. Rogers,\r\nColonel Higginson and Mr. Samuel Powell, a number of friends were called\r\ntogether in the early summer of 1874 and she laid before them the plan\r\nof the proposed club. After speaking of the growing predominance of the\r\ngay and fashionable element in Newport society, she said:--\r\n\r\n\"But some things can be done as well as others. Newport ... has also\r\ntreasures which are still unexplored....\r\n\r\n\"The milliner and the mantua-maker bring here their costly goods and\r\ntempt the eye with forms and colors. But the great artist, Nature, has\r\nhere merchandise far more precious, whose value and beauty are\r\nunderstood by few of us. I remember once meeting a philosopher in a\r\njeweller's shop. The master of the establishment exhibited to us his\r\nchoicest wares, among others a costly diamond ornament. The philosopher\r\n[we think it was Emerson] said, 'A violet is more beautiful.' I cannot\r\nforget the disgust expressed in the jeweller's face at this remark.\"\r\n\r\nShe then outlined the course laid out by the \"Friends in Council,\"\r\nlectures on astronomy, botany, natural history, all by eminent persons.\r\nThey would not expect the Club to meet them on their own ground. They\r\nwould come to that of their hearers, and would unfold to them what they\r\nwere able to understand.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Weir Mitchell discoursed to them on the Poison of Serpents,\r\nJohn La Farge on the South Sea Islands, Alexander Agassiz on Deep-Sea\r\nDredging and the Panama Canal; while Mark Twain and \"Hans Breitmann\"\r\nmade merry, each in his own inimitable fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Town and Country Club had a long and happy career. No matter what\r\nheavy work she might have on hand for the summer, no sooner arrived at\r\nNewport than our mother called together her Governing Committee and\r\nplanned out the season's meetings.\r\n\r\nIt may have been for this Club that she wrote her \"Parlor Macbeth,\" an\r\nextravaganza in which she appeared as \"the impersonation of the whole\r\nMacbeth family.\"\r\n\r\nIn the prologue she says:--\r\n\r\n\"As it is often said and supposed that a woman is at the bottom of all\r\nthe mischief that is done under the sun, I appear and say that I am she,\r\nthat woman, the female fate of the Macbeth family.\"\r\n\r\nIn the monologue that follows, Lady Macbeth fairly lives before the\r\naudience, and in amazing travesty relates the course of the drama.\r\n\r\nShe thus describes the visit of the weird sisters (the three Misses\r\nMacbeth) who have been asked to contribute some of \"their excellent\r\nhell-broth and devilled articles\" for her party.\r\n\r\n\"At 12 M., a rushing and bustling was heard, and down the kitchen\r\nchimney tumbled the three weird sisters, finding everything ready for\r\ntheir midnight operations.... 'That hussy of a Macbeth's wife leaves us\r\nnothing to work with,' cried one. 'She makes double trouble for us.'\r\n'Double trouble, double trouble,' they all cried and groaned in chorus,\r\nand presently fell into a sort of trilogy of mingled prose and verse\r\nwhich was enough to drive one mad.\r\n\r\n  'Where hast thou been?\r\n                  Sticking pigs.\r\n  And where hast thou?\r\n                  Why, curling wigs\r\n  Fit for a shake in German jigs\r\n        And hoo! carew! carew!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'We must have Hecate now, can't do without her. Throw the beans over\r\nthe broomstick and say boo!' And lo, Hecate comes, much like the others,\r\nonly rather more so....\r\n\r\n\"Now they began to work in good earnest. And they had brought with them\r\nwhole bottles of _sunophon_, and _sozodont_, and _rypophagon_, and\r\n_hyperbolism_ and _consternaculum_, and a few others. And in the whole\r\nwent. And one stirred the great pot over the fire, while the others\r\ndanced around and sang--\r\n\r\n  \"'Black pepper and red,\r\n  White pepper and grey,\r\n  Tingle, tingle, tingle, tingle,\r\n  Till it smarts all day.'\r\n\r\n\"'Here's dyspepsia! Here's your racking headache of a morning. Here's\r\npodagra, and jaundice, and a few fits. And now it's done to a turn, and\r\nthe weird sisters have done what they could for the family.'\r\n\r\n\"A rumbling and tumbling and foaming was now heard in the chimney--the\r\nbricks opened, and He-cat and She-cat and all the rest of them went up.\r\nAnd I knew that my supper would be first-rate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time came when some of the other officers of the Town and Country\r\nClub felt unable to keep the pace set by her. She would still press\r\nforward, but they hung back, feeling the burden of the advancing years\r\nwhich sat so lightly on her shoulders. The Club was disbanded; its fund\r\nof one thousand dollars, so honorably earned, was given to the Redwood\r\nLibrary, one of the old institutions of Newport.\r\n\r\nThe Town and Country Club was succeeded by the Papéterie, a smaller club\r\nof ladies only, more intimate in its character. The exchange of \"paper\r\nnovels\" furnished its name and its _raison d'être_. The members were\r\nexpected to describe the books taken home from the previous meeting.\r\n\"What have you to tell us of the novel you have been reading?\" the\r\npresident would demand. Then followed a report, serious or comic, as the\r\ncharacter of the volume or the mood of the meeting suggested. A series\r\nof abbreviated criticisms was made and a glossary prepared: for\r\nexample,--\r\n\r\n  \"B. P.--By the pound.\r\n  M. A. S.--May amuse somebody.\r\n  P. B.--Pot-boiler.\r\n  F. W. B.--For waste-basket.\r\n  U. I.--Uplifting influence.\r\n  W. D.--Wholly delightful.\r\n  U. T.--Utter trash.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers consisted of the Glossarian, the Penologist, whose duty it\r\nwas to invent penalties for delinquents, the Cor. Sec. and the Rec. Sec.\r\n(corresponding and recording secretaries) and the Archivist, who had\r\ncharge of the archives. During its early years a novel was written by\r\nthe Club, each member writing one chapter. It still exists, and part of\r\nthe initiation of a new member consists in reading the manuscript. The\r\n\"delicious fooling\" that marked the first year of the Town and Country\r\nClub's existence was the animating spirit of the Papéterie. A friend\r\nchristened it \"Mrs. Howe's Vaudeville.\" Merrymaking was her\r\nsafety-valve. Brain fag and nervous prostration were practically unknown\r\nto her. When she had worked to the point of exhaustion, she turned to\r\nplay. Fun and frolic went along with labor and prayer; the power of\r\ncombining these kept her steadily at her task till the end of her life.\r\nThe last time she left her house, six days before her death, it was to\r\npreside at the Papéterie, where she was as usual the life of the\r\nmeeting! The Club still lives, and, like the New England Woman's Club,\r\nseems still pervaded by her spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Clubs did not have all the fun. The Newport \"Evening Express\" of\r\nSeptember 2, 1881, says: \"Mrs. Julia Ward Howe has astonished Newport by\r\nher acting in 'False Colors.' But she always was a surprising woman.\"\r\n\r\nAnother newspaper says: \"The interest of the Newport world has been\r\ndivided this week between the amateur theatricals at the Casino and the\r\nlawn tennis tournament. Two representations of the comedy of 'False\r\nColors' were given on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.... The stars were\r\nundoubtedly Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and Mr. Peter Marié, who brought down\r\nthe house by their brightness and originality.... Mr. Peter Marié gave a\r\nsupper on the last night of the performance, during which he proposed\r\nthe health of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and the thanks of the company for her\r\nvaluable assistance. Mrs. Howe's reply was very bright and apt, and her\r\nplayful warnings of the dangers of sailing under false colors were fully\r\nappreciated.\"\r\n\r\nIt is remembered that of all the gay company she was the only one who\r\nwas letter-perfect in her part.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to 1879. She preached many times this summer in and around\r\nNewport.\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday, September 28._ Hard at work. Could not look at my sermon until\r\nthis day. Corrected my reply to Parkman.[90] Had a very large audience\r\nfor the place--all seats full and benches put in.\"\r\n\r\n  [90] Francis Parkman had written an article opposing woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n\"My sermon at the Unitarian Church in Newport. A most unexpected crowd\r\nto hear me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 29._ Busy with preparing the dialogue in 'Alice in\r\nWonderland' for the Town and Country Club occasion....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMany entries begin with \"hard at work,\" or \"very busy all day.\"\r\n\r\nThis summer was made delightful by a visit from her sister Louisa, with\r\nher husband[91] and daughter. Music formed a large part of the summer's\r\npleasure. The Journal tells of a visit from Timothée Adamowski which was\r\ngreatly enjoyed.\r\n\r\n  [91] Luther Terry, an American painter who had lived long in Rome, and\r\n  had been a close friend of Thomas Crawford. He survived his wife by some\r\n  years.\r\n\r\n\"_October 11._ Much delightful music. Adamowski has made a pleasant\r\nimpression upon all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 12, Sunday._ Sorry to say we made music all day. Looked hard\r\nfor Uncle Sam, who came not.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 13._ Our delightful matinée. Adamowski and Daisy played\r\nfinely, he making a great sensation. I had the pleasure of accompanying\r\nAdamowski in a Nocturne of Chopin's for violin and piano. All went well.\r\nOur pleasure and fatigue were both great. The house looked charming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn came a lecture tour, designed to recoup the heavy expenses\r\nof the Eastern trip. Never skilful in matters of money-making, this tour\r\nwas undertaken with less preparation than the modern lecturer could well\r\nimagine. She corresponded with one and another Unitarian clergyman and\r\narranged her lectures largely through them. Though she did not bring\r\nback so much money as many less popular speakers, she was, after all,\r\nher own mistress, and was not rushed through the country like a letter\r\nby ambitious managers.\r\n\r\nThe Journal gives some glimpses of this trip.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty minutes to dress, sup, and get to the hall. Swallowed a cup of\r\ntea and nibbled a biscuit as I dressed myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Found the miserablest railroad hotel, where I waited all day for trunk,\r\nin distress!... Had to lecture without either dress or manuscript. Mrs.\r\nBlank hastily arrayed me in her black silk, and I had fortunately a few\r\nnotes.\"\r\n\r\nShe never forgot this lesson, and in all the thirty-odd years of\r\nspeaking and lecturing that remained, made it an invariable rule to\r\ntravel with her lecture and her cap and laces in her handbag. As she\r\ngrew older, the satchel grew lighter. She disliked all personal service,\r\nand always wanted to carry her hand-luggage herself. The light palm-leaf\r\nknapsack she brought from Santo Domingo was at the end replaced by a\r\nnet, the lightest thing she could find.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unitarian Church in Newport was second in her heart only to the\r\nChurch of the Disciples. The Reverend Charles T. Brooks, the pastor, was\r\nher dear friend. In the spring of 1880 a Channing memorial celebration\r\nwas held in Newport, for which she wrote a poem. She sat on the platform\r\nnear Mr. Emerson, heard Dr. Bellows's discourse on Channing, \"which was\r\nexhaustive, and as it lasted two hours, exhausting.\" The exercises, W.\r\nH. Channing's eulogium, etc., etc., lasted through the day and evening,\r\nand in the intervals between addresses she was \"still retouching\" her\r\npoem, which came last of all. \"A great day!\" says the Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_July 23._ Very busy all day. Rainy weather. In the evening I had a\r\nmock meeting, with burlesque papers, etc. I lectured on _Ism-Is-not-m_,\r\non _Asm-spasm-plasm_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 24._ Working hard, as usual. Marionettes at home in the evening.\r\nLaura had written the text. Maud was Julius Cæsar; Flossy, Cassius;\r\nDaisy, Brutus.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 28._ Read my lecture on 'Modern Society' in the Hillside Chapel\r\nat Concord.... The comments of Messrs. Alcott and W. H. Channing were\r\nquite enough to turn a sober head.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the poorhouse and to Jacob Chase's with Joseph Coggeshall. Old\r\nElsteth, whom I remember these many years, died a few weeks ago. One of\r\nthe pauper women who has been there a long time told me that Elsteth\r\ncried out that she was going to Heaven, and that she gave her, as a last\r\ngift, a red handkerchief. Mrs. Anna Brown, whom I saw last year, died\r\nrecently. Her relatives are people in good position and ought to have\r\nprovided for her in her declining years. They came, in force, to her\r\nfuneral and had a very nice coffin for her. Took her body away for\r\nburial. Such meanness needs no comment.\r\n\r\n\"Jacob was glad to see me. Asked after Maud and doubted whether she was\r\nas handsome as I was when he first saw me (thirty or more years ago).\r\nHis wife said to me in those days: 'Jacob thinks thee's the only\r\ngood-looking woman in these parts.' She was herself a handsome woman and\r\na very sweet one. I wish I had known I was so good-looking.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the writing of letters there was no end. Correspondence was rather a\r\nburden than a delight to her; yet, when all the \"duty letters\" were\r\nwritten, she loved to take a fresh sheet and frolic with some one of her\r\nabsent children. Laura, being the furthest removed, received perhaps\r\nmore than her share of these letters; yet, as will appear from them, she\r\nnever had enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                      OAK GLEN, October 10, 1880.\r\n\r\nDEAREST, DEAREST L. E. R.,--\r\n\r\nHow I wonder how you R! Cause of silence not hardness of heart, but the\r\ngiven necessity of scribbling for dear life, to finish a promised paper\r\nfor the Woman's Congress, _sedebit_ next week. I in Boston Wed., Thurs.,\r\nand Fri.--day being understood. Mowski [Adamowski] left us yesterday\r\nmorning.... We had him here a fortnight, and enjoyed his visit\r\nextremely. At table, between the courses, he played on every instrument\r\nof the orchestra. I asked once for the bass drum, which he imitated,\r\nadding thereunto the cymbals. We had a lunch party last week, for the\r\nbride, Maud Appleton, and \"invited quite fashionable,\" and after all\r\nshe didn't come. \"Sick in bed with diphtheria.\" May by some be\r\nconsidered an excuse, but then, it's very rude to be sick, and it's very\r\ntroublesome to other people. (This to make you feel badly about your own\r\nshortcomings.) We had a little dance, too, on Friday evening. An omnibus\r\nparty came out and a few others. I pounded the Lancers and some ancient\r\nwaltzes and polkas, ending with the Virginia reel, in which last I\r\nthought my floor would give way, the young men stamped so. I have no\r\npaper left except some newspaper wrappers, so can't write any more. Got\r\nup and found this scrap, then hunted for my pen, which, after some\r\nsearch, I found in my mouth. This is what it is to be lit'ry. Oh, my! I\r\nsometimes wish I wasn't!...\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October, while visiting Julia at the Institution, she missed her\r\nfooting and fell down the two steps leading to the dining-room, breaking\r\nthe ligaments of her knee. A letter to Laura makes the first mention of\r\nthis serious accident, whose effects she felt all her life.\r\n\r\n                                      OAK GLEN, November 9, 1880.\r\n\r\nDEAREST LAURA CHILD,--\r\n\r\nBehold the mum-jacket, sitting clothed and in her chair, confronting you\r\nafter long silence, with comforting words of recovery. I am now in the\r\nfourth week of my infirmity, and I really think that the offending, or\r\nrather offended, muscles have almost recovered their natural power of\r\ncontraction. My exercise is still restricted to a daily walk from my bed\r\nin the small parlor to my chair in the large parlor, and back again.\r\nBut this walk, which at first was an impotent limp, with bones clicking\r\nloosely, is now a very respectable performance, not on the tight rope,\r\nindeed, but, let us say, on the tight garter.... The only break in the\r\ngeneral uniformity of my life was dear Uncle Sam's arrival on Sunday\r\nlast. He remained with us a couple of hours, and was as delightful as\r\never. Oh! more news. With his kind help, I have taken Mrs. Lodge's small\r\nhouse for the winter and this opens to me a comfortable prospect,\r\nthough, even with his help, the two ends will have to be pulled a little\r\nin order to meet....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe furnished house in lower Mount Vernon Street proved a pleasant\r\nhabitat. It was nine years since she had had a house in Boston; in spite\r\nof her lameness, perhaps partly because of it, she enjoyed entertaining\r\nher family and friends. Mrs. Terry and her daughter spent part of the\r\nwinter with them.\r\n\r\nThe year 1880 was marked by the publication of her first book since\r\n\"Later Lyrics\": a tiny volume entitled \"Modern Society,\" containing,\r\nbeside the title essay, a kindred one on \"Changes in American Society.\"\r\nThe Journal makes little or no mention of this booklet, but Thomas\r\nWentworth Higginson says of it: \"It would be hard to find a book in\r\nAmerican literature better worth reprinting and distributing.... In wit,\r\nin wisdom, in anecdote, I know few books so racy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_January 1, 1881._ I have now been lame for twelve weeks, in\r\nconsequence of a bad fall which I had on October 17. I am still on\r\ncrutches with my left knee in a splint. Have had much valuable leisure\r\nin consequence of this, but have suffered much inconvenience and\r\nprivation of preaching, social intercourse, etc. Very little pain since\r\nthe first ten days. Farewell, Old Year! Thank the Heavenly Father for\r\nmany joys, comforts and opportunities.\"\r\n\r\nHer physician insisted upon her keeping quiet, but she could not obey\r\nhim, and continued to travel about on crutches to keep her many\r\nengagements. Her faithful coachman, Frank McCarthy, was her companion on\r\nthese journeys.\r\n\r\n\"_January 26._ Busy most of the day with my lecture. Had a visit from H.\r\nP. B.,[92] who advised me to keep still and go nowhere until my lameness\r\nshall be much better. Took 4.30 train for Concord, Massachusetts. Maud\r\nwould go with me, which grieved me, as she thereby lost a brilliant\r\nball.... We went to Mr. Cheney's, where we found Frank Barlow, a little\r\nolder, but quite unchanged as to character, etc. He has the endearing\r\ncoquetry of a woman. Dear Mr. Emerson and Mrs. came to my lecture. Mr.\r\nE. said that he liked it. The audience was very attentive throughout.\r\nStepped only once on my lame foot in getting into the sleigh....\"\r\n\r\n  [92] Dr. H. P. Beach.\r\n\r\n\"_January 28._ Busy all day with my address for woman's suffrage meeting\r\nin the evening.... When I entered with my crutches the audience\r\napplauded quite generally.... Wendell Phillips made the concluding\r\nspeech of the evening. He was less brilliant than usual, and kept\r\nreferring to what I had said. I thanked him for this afterwards, and he\r\nsaid that my speech had spoiled his own; that I had taken up the very\r\npoints upon which he had intended to dwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 11._ Lecture at Groton, Massachusetts. As I went down the\r\nsteps to the carriage, one of my crutches slipped and the careless\r\nhackman on my right let me fall, Frank catching me, but not until I had\r\ngiven my knee a severe wrench which gave me great pain. I suffered much\r\nin my travel, but got through, Frank helping me.... My knee seemed much\r\ninflamed and kept me awake much of the night. My lecture on 'Polite\r\nSociety' was well received. The good people of the house brought me\r\ntheir new ledger, that my name might be the first recorded in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 12._ Dinner of Merchants' Club. Edward Atkinson invites me.\r\nGot back by early train, 7.50 A.M., feeling poorly. Did not let Maud\r\nknow of my hurt. Went to the dinner mentioned above, which was at the\r\nVendôme.... Was taken in to dinner by the President, Mr. Fitz. Robert\r\nCollyer had the place on my right. He was delightful as ever. Edward\r\nEverett Hale sat near me and talked with me from time to time. Of course\r\nmy speech afflicted me. I got through it, however, but had to lose the\r\nother speeches, the hour being so late and the night so inclement, very\r\nrainy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 20._ Very lame this morning. No courage to try to go out.\r\nHave been busy with Kant and Miss Cobbe's new book, 'Duties of Women,'\r\nwhich I am reviewing for the 'Christian Register.'...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                                129 MOUNT VERNON STREET,\r\n\r\n                                                    February 27, 1881.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LAURA,--\r\n\r\n... Mr. Longfellow came to see us yesterday, and told us his curious\r\ndreams. In one of them, he went to London and found James Russell Lowell\r\n_keeping a grocery._ In another, people were vituperating the bad\r\nweather, and dear Papa said: \"Remember, gentlemen, who makes it!\" This\r\nimpressed us as very characteristic of our dear one. My lameness is\r\ndecreasing very slowly, and I have now been a week without the splint.\r\nThe knee, however, still swells if I attempt to use it, and my life is\r\nstill much restricted as to movement....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_February 28...._ A cloud seems to lift itself from that part of my\r\nmind which concerns, or should concern, itself with spiritual things.\r\nSometimes a strong unwillen seizes me in this direction. I feel in\r\nmyself no capacity to comprehend any features of the unseen world. My\r\nbelief in it does not change, but my imagination refuses to act upon the\r\nbasis of the 'things not seen.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 5._ Longfellow to dine.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 30._ In the evening to the ever-pleasing Hasty-Pudding\r\nTheatrical Play, a burlesque of Victor Hugo's 'Notre Dame de Paris,'\r\nwith many saucy interjections. The fun and spirits of the young men were\r\nvery contagious, and must have cheered all present who needed\r\ncheering....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                         129 MOUNT VERNON STREET,\r\n\r\n                                               March 24, 1881.\r\n\r\nMY DARLING LAURA,--\r\n\r\nThe March wind blows, and gives me the spleen. I don't care about\r\nanything, don't want my books, nor my friends, nor nothing. But you,\r\npoor child, may not be in this wicked, not caring condition, and so I\r\nwill write you, having oughted to for a considerable time. Nothing stays\r\nput, not even put-ty. Letters don't stay answered, faces don't stay\r\nwashed, clothes don't stay either clean or new. Children won't stay the\r\nyoungest. The world won't stay anywhere, anyhow. Forty years ago was\r\ngood enough for me. Why couldn't it stay? Now, I see you undertaking to\r\ncomfort me in good earnest, and know just how you would begin by saying:\r\n\"Well, it should!\"... Nunc Richard[93] here yesterday. Remarked nothing\r\nin particular, I replying in like manner. Kept his arm very dark, under\r\na sort of cloak. We condoled [with] each other upon our mental\r\nstupidity, and parted with no particular views or sentiments. I have\r\nbeen to-day at a worldly fashionable lunch. Nobody cared for anything\r\nbut what they had on and had to eat. \"He! he!\" said one: \"ho! ho! ho!\"\r\nthe other. \"Is your uncle dead yet?\" \"No, but my aunt is.\" \"Grandfather\r\nWobblestick used to say\"--\"Why, of course he did!\" Which is all that I\r\nremember of the conversation. Now, darling, this is perfectly hateful of\r\nme to turn and snarl at the hand which has just been putting good\r\nmorsels into my mouth. But you see, this is a March wind in Boston, and\r\nI can't help it. And I hobbled greatly up the big staircase, also down.\r\nThat's all. Auntie and Daisy and Maud lunched, too, munchingly. D. made\r\na new capote for Maud. Nobody made nothing new for me. I had no lace bow\r\nunder my chin, and looked so neglected! Maud and Daisy always on the\r\nwing, concerts, theatres, lunches, etc., etc. Auntie and I have some\r\ngood evenings at home, in which we refresh the venerable intelligence\r\nwith the modern publication, we do, to wit, \"Early Life of Charles James\r\nFox.\" We also play Russian backgammon. Big Frank Crawford has\r\nenlargement of 's liver. This P.M. late Mrs. C. C. Perkins has recep.\r\nfor Miss Carl Schurz. Girls going, but going first to X.'s weekly weak\r\ntea and weaker talk. Here again, you spleeny devil, get thee behind me!\r\nI love my fellow-creatures, but, bless you, not in this month.... Julia\r\nNagnos takes tea round generally, and finds that it agrees with her....\r\nI regard you, on the whole, with feeling. Farewell, Laura, I am your\r\npoor old mad March hare Mamma. Love to Skip and the little ones.\r\n\r\n  [93] The late Richard Sullivan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_April 7._ Finished Carlyle's 'Reminiscences' to-day. Perhaps nothing\r\nthat he has left shows more clearly what he was, and was not. A loyal,\r\nfervent, witty, keen man.... His characterizations of individuals are\r\nkeenly hit off with graphic humor. But he could make sad mistakes, and\r\ncould not find them out, as in the case of what he calls our 'beautiful\r\nNigger Agony'!!\"\r\n\r\n\"I went out to the Cambridge Club, having had chills and fever all the\r\nnight before. Read my lecture on Paris, which was well received, and\r\nfollowed by a good discussion with plenty of differences of opinion.\r\nEvening at home; another chill and fever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                            129 MOUNT VERNON STREET,\r\n\r\n                                                 April 24, 1881.\r\n\r\nBad old party, is and was. Badness mostly of heart, though head has a\r\ndecided crack in it. Unfeeling old Beast! Left Laura so long without a\r\nword. Guess 't isn't worth while for her to write anything more.\r\n\r\nMy poor dear little Laura, how miserably you must have been feeling, I\r\nknow well by your long silence. Oh! posterity! posterity! how much you\r\ncost, and how little you come to! Did I not cost as much as another? And\r\nwhat do I come to? By Jingo!\r\n\r\nDarling, I have got some little miserable mean excuses. Want 'em? Have\r\nhad much writing to do, many words for little money. For \"Critic\" (N.Y.)\r\nand for \"Youth's Companion\" and other things. Then, have kept up great\r\ncorrespondence with Uncle Sam, who has given me a house in Beacon\r\nStreet! _oh gonniac!_[94]\r\n\r\n  [94] Welsh for \"glory\": a favorite exclamation of hers, learned in\r\n  childhood from a Welsh servant.\r\n\r\nWe had lit'ry party last week. Dr. Holmes and William Dean Howells read\r\noriginal things. James Freeman Clarke recited and we had ices and\r\npunch. Maud thought it frumpy, but others liked it very much. Have been\r\nto church to-day, heard J. F. C. 'Most off crutches now and hobble about\r\nthe house with a cane. Use crutches to go up and down stairs and to walk\r\nin the street.... Have heard much music and have seen Salvini once, in\r\nthe \"Gladiator,\" and hope to see him on Thursday, in \"Macbeth.\" How are\r\nthe dear children? I do want to see them, 'specially July Ward....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_May 27._ Soon after 7 A.M. arrived Uncle Sam with my dear sister Annie\r\nMailliard from California; the whole intended as a birthday surprise. My\r\nsister is very little changed; always a most tender, sensitive woman.\r\nSister Louisa didn't know of this and came at 11 A.M. to bring my\r\ngreetings and gifts, with Mr. Terry, Daisy, and Uncle Sam. When Sister\r\nAnnie appeared, Sister Louisa almost fainted with delight and\r\nastonishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 20, Oak Glen_, Dear Flossy suffering at 6 A.M.--about all day.\r\nHer child, a fine boy, born at 3 P.M. We are all very happy and\r\nthankful. It was touching to see the surprise and joy of the little\r\nchildren when they were admitted to a sight of their new relative. There\r\nwas something reverent in the aspect of the little creatures, as if they\r\npartly felt the mystery of this new life which they could not\r\nunderstand. Some one told them that it came from Heaven. Harry, four\r\nyears old, said: 'No, it didn't come from Heaven, for it hasn't any\r\nwings.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n              _To Laura (who, as usual, wanted a letter)_\r\n\r\n                                         OAK GLEN, July 10, 1881.\r\n\r\nYes, she was a little injured, but not so bad as she pretends. Feelings\r\nhurt dreadful? Self-esteem bruised and swollen? Spleen a little touched?\r\nWell, she has had the doctor, and the doctor said: \"Her mother is a\r\npublic character, what can we do about it?\"\r\n\r\n  Could my ink forever flow,\r\n  Could my pen no respite know.\r\n\r\nWell, my darling, it was too bad, so we'll make up, and kiss and be\r\nfriends. But now you look here. Besides all my lit'ry work, which seems\r\nto be heaviest in summer time, I had an awful deal to do in taking care\r\nof Flossy's children and the new baby. The babe is of the crying sort!\r\nWhen anything is to be done for his Ma, the nurse expects some one to\r\nhold him.... I returned last night from a journey to Vermont, where I\r\nread a paper before the American Institute of Education, and also spoke\r\nat a suffrage meeting and also at an outdoor mass meeting, and also at a\r\nsuffrage meeting in Montpelier, and came back, after four days' absence,\r\nvery tired. (Chorus, Don't tell Maud.)...\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_August 30._ My first performance at the Casino Theatre. It went off\r\nvery successfully, and I was much applauded, as were most of the others.\r\nSupper afterwards at Mrs. Richard Hunt's, where I had to appear in\r\n'plain clothes,' having been unable to accomplish evening dress after\r\nthe play. Dear Flossy went with me.\"\r\n\r\nAnother \"performance\" of that summer is not noted in the Journal; an\r\nimpromptu rendering of \"Horatius at the Bridge,\" in the \"green parlor\"\r\nat Oak Glen, with the following cast:--\r\n\r\n  Horatius               F. Marion Crawford.\r\n  Spurius Lartius        J. W. H.\r\n  Herminius              Maud Howe.\r\n\r\nThe green parlor was an oval grass plot, thickly screened by tall\r\ncedars. Laura recited the ballad, keeping her voice as she could while\r\nthe heroes waged desperate combat, but breaking down entirely when\r\nHoratius \"plunged headlong in the tide,\" and swam with magnificent\r\naction across--the greensward!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_September 18._ Preached in Tiverton to-day. Text: 'The fashion of this\r\nworld passeth away.' Subject: Fashion, an intense but transient power;\r\nin contradistinction, the eternal things of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 25._ Spent much of this day in composing a poem in\r\ncommemoration of President Garfield's death. Spared no pains with this\r\nand succeeded better than I had expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 26._ The President's funeral. Services held in most cities\r\nof the United States, I should judge. Solemn services also in London and\r\nLiverpool.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _To Samuel Ward_\r\n\r\n                                               241 BEACON STREET,\r\n\r\n                                               December 22, 1881.\r\n\r\nDEAREST BROTHER,--\r\n\r\n... _Your_ house, darling, was bright and lovely, yesterday. I had my\r\nold pet, Edwin Booth, to lunch--we were nine at table, the poet Aldrich\r\ndisappointing us. From three to four we had a reception for Mr. Booth,\r\nquite the _crême de la crême_, I assure you. Among others, Dr. Holmes\r\ncame. The rooms and furniture were much admired. We gave only tea at the\r\nlevee, but had some of your good wine at the luncheon.\r\n\r\nP.S. Mr. Booth in \"Lear\" last night was sublime!\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To the same_\r\n\r\nEdwin Booth had sent us his box for the evening. The play was \"Hamlet,\"\r\nthe performance masterly. People's tastes about plays differ, but I am\r\nsure that no one on the boards can begin to do what Booth does. I saw\r\nhim for a moment after the play, and he told me that he had done his\r\nbest for me. Somehow, I thought that he was doing his very best, but did\r\nnot suppose that he was thinking of me particularly....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_January 29, 1882._ Frank [Marion Crawford] had met Oscar Wilde the\r\nevening before at Dr. Chadwick's; said that he expressed a desire to\r\nmake my acquaintance. Wrote before I went to church to invite him to\r\nlunch. He accepted and Maud and Frank, or rather Marion, flew about to\r\nget together friends and viands. Returning from a lifting and delightful\r\nsermon of J. F. C.'s, I met Maud at the door. She cried: 'Oscar is\r\ncoming.' Mrs. Jack Gardner, Madame Braggiotti, and Julia completed our\r\nlunch party. Perhaps ten or twelve friends came after lunch. We had what\r\nI might call a 'lovely toss-up,' _i.e._, a social dish quickly\r\ncompounded and tossed up like an omelet.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this year and the next, Crawford made his home at 241 Beacon\r\nStreet. Here he wrote his first three books, \"Mr. Isaacs,\" \"Dr.\r\nClaudius,\" and \"A Roman Singer.\" He was a delightful inmate, and the\r\nmonths he spent under our mother's roof were happy ones. A tender\r\n_camaraderie_ existed between aunt and nephew. During his first winter\r\nin Boston he thought of going on the stage as a singer, and studied\r\nsinging with Georg Henschel. He had a fine voice, a dramatic manner,\r\nfull of fire, but an imperfect ear. This fault Henschel at first thought\r\ncould be remedied: for months they labored together, trying to overcome\r\nit. Crawford delighted in singing, and \"Auntie\" in playing his\r\naccompaniments. At dusk the two would repair to the old Chickering grand\r\nto make music--Schubert, Brahms, and arias from the oratorios they both\r\nloved. In the evening the three guitars would be brought out, and aunt\r\nand nephew, with Maud or Brother Harry, would sing and play German\r\nstudents' songs, or the folk-songs of Italy, Ireland, and Scotland. Our\r\nmother was sure to be asked for Matthias Claudius's \"_Als Noah aus dem\r\nKasten war_\": Crawford would respond with \"_Im schwarzen Wallfisch zu\r\nAscalon_.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first of thirty happy years passed at 241 Beacon Street,\r\nthe house Uncle Sam bought for her. The day she moved in, a friend asked\r\nher the number of her new house.\r\n\r\n\"241,\" she answered. \"You can remember it because I'm the two-forty\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde was at this time making a lecture tour through the United\r\nStates. This was the heyday of his popularity; he had been heralded as\r\nthe apostle of the æsthetic movement. At his first lecture, given at the\r\nold Boston Music Hall, he appeared in a black velvet court suit with\r\nruffles, and black silk stockings, his hair long and curling on his\r\nshoulders. A few moments after he had taken his place on the platform, a\r\nstring of Harvard students filed into the hall, dressed in caricature of\r\nthe lecturer's costume, each with a sunflower in his coat and a peacock\r\nfeather in his hand. Our mother, who was in the audience, recognized\r\nnear the head of the procession her favorite grand-nephew, Winthrop\r\nChanler. Wilde took this interruption in good part, welcoming the lads\r\nand turning the laugh against them. \"Imitation is the sincerest\r\nflattery,\" he said, \"though this is a case where I might say, 'Save me\r\nfrom my friends.'\"\r\n\r\nWilde came several times to the house in Boston; later Uncle Sam brought\r\nhim to spend a day or two at Oak Glen, where the household was thrown\r\ninto a flutter by the advent of his valet. It was one thing to entertain\r\nthe æsthete, another to put up the gentleman's gentleman. In spite of\r\nall the affectation of the æsthetic pose, Wilde proved a rarely\r\nentertaining guest. He talked amazingly well; in that company all that\r\nwas best in the man came to the surface. He recited his noble poem, \"The\r\nOde to Albion,\" under the trees of Oak Glen, and told endless stories of\r\nSwinburne, Whistler, and other celebrities of the day. The dreadful\r\ntragedy came later; at this time he was one of the most brilliant\r\nfigures in the literary world.\r\n\r\n\"_March 4._ To Saturday Morning Club with Mrs. [John] Sherwood; very\r\nbusy; then with her to Blind Asylum in a carriage. Drove up to front\r\nentrance and alighted, when the gale took me off my feet and threw me\r\ndown, spraining my left knee so badly as to render me quite helpless. I\r\nmanaged to hobble into the Institution and to get through Julia's lunch,\r\nafter which I was driven home. Sent for Dr. Beach and was convicted of a\r\nbad sprain, and sentenced to six weeks of (solitary) confinement.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 5._ In bed all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 6._ On the lounge; able to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 8._ Day of mid-year conference of A.A.W. Business meeting at the\r\nN.E.W.C., where I, of course, could not be present. Afternoon meeting\r\nwas in my room. On the whole satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                                241 BEACON STREET,\r\n\r\n                                                  March 18, 1882.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, my dearest, let there be no further pribbles and prabbles,\r\nwhich I conjugate thus: I pribble, thou prabblest, he, she, or it\r\npribble prabbles. Maud leaveth on a Tuesday, come thou on that same\r\nTuesday, taking care to keep thy nose in front of thy countenance, and\r\nnot otherwisely, which were neither wisely nor too well. I hope thou\r\nwilt not fail to come on Tuesday. And pray don't forget the baby, as the\r\nnurse might find it lonesome to be here without her. During the period\r\nof thy visit, I will change my name to _Jinkins_, we will have such high\r\nJinks!... Beacon Street looks as though it wanted something. I think\r\nthou beest it....\r\n\r\n  Am ever thy lame game MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_March 24._ Longfellow died at about 3.30 P.M. to-day. He will be much\r\nand deservedly lamented. The last of dear Chev's old set, the Five of\r\nClubs, nicknamed by Mary Dwight the 'Mutual Admiration Society.' On\r\nhearing of this event, I put off my reception for the Zuñi chiefs, which\r\nshould have been on Monday, when the funeral will probably take place.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 26._ Dear Brother Sam came on very unexpectedly to attend the\r\nfuneral service held at the Longfellow [house] for relatives and\r\nintimates. I also was bidden to this, but thought it impossible for me\r\nto go, lame as I am. Sent word out to Julia Anagnos, who came in, and\r\nwent in my place with Uncle Sam. The dear old fellow dined with us. I\r\ngot downstairs with great difficulty and fatigue. We had a delightful\r\nevening with him, but he would go back to New York by the night train.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 30._ To-day the Zuñi chiefs and Mr. Cushing, their interpreter\r\nand adopted son, came to luncheon at 1.45. There were twelve Indian\r\nchiefs in full Indian dress. Reception afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Zuñi Indians live in Arizona. Once in the year they make a\r\npilgrimage to the seashore, and wading into the ocean at sunrise, offer\r\nprayer to the Great Spirit, and fill their vessels of woven grass with\r\nwater to be used through the year in their religious exercises. This\r\npilgrimage had always been made to the Pacific; but in the hearts of the\r\ntribe lingered a tradition that once in a hundred years the \"Water of\r\nSunrise\" should be visited, and they dreamed of the Eastern ocean. The\r\ntradition was now confirmed, the dream fulfilled, through the friendly\r\noffices of Mr. Cushing.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was one of touching interest; hundreds of people gathered\r\nat City Point to watch it. Most of the spectators felt the beauty and\r\nsolemnity of the service (for such it was), but a few were inclined to\r\njeer, till they were sternly rebuked by Phillips Brooks.\r\n\r\nAs our mother could not go to see the Zuñis, they must come to see her,\r\nand Mr. Cushing gladly brought them. They were grave, stalwart men, with\r\na beautiful dignity of carriage and demeanor. A picture not to be\r\nforgotten is that of her in her white dress, bending eagerly forward to\r\nlisten while the chiefs, sitting in a circle on the floor, told stories,\r\nMr. Cushing interpreting for her benefit. At parting, each man took her\r\nhand, and raised it to his forehead with a gesture of perfect grace. The\r\neldest chief, before this salute, held her hand a moment, and blew\r\nacross the palm, east and west. \"Daughter,\" he said, \"our paths have\r\ncrossed here. May yours be bright hereafter!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_April 1._ To-day Edward [Everett] Hale brought me a parting memento of\r\nthe Zuñis--the basket with which they had dipped up the water from the\r\n'ocean of sunrise.' Mr. Cushing sent this. E. E. H. also spoke about\r\nfive hymns which should be written corresponding to the five great\r\nhymns of the Catholic mass. He asked me to write one of these and I\r\npromised to try.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 16._ Splint off to-day. Waited for Dr. Beach, so could not go to\r\nchurch. Had an interesting talk with the Doctor on the Immortality of\r\nthe Soul, in which he is a believer.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 27._ Made to-day a good start in writing about Margaret Fuller.\r\nThis night at 8.50 P.M. died Ralph Waldo Emerson, _i.e._, all of him\r\nthat could die. I think of him as a father gone--father of so much\r\nbeauty, of so much modern thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 7._ To church, going out for the first time without a crutch,\r\nusing only my cane.\r\n\r\n\"J. F. C.'s sermon was about Emerson, and was very interesting and\r\ndelicately appreciative. I think that he exaggerated Emerson's solid and\r\npractical effect in the promotion of modern liberalism. The change was\r\nin the air and was to come. It was in many minds quite independently of\r\nMr. Emerson. He was the foremost literary man of his day in America,\r\nphilosopher, poet, reformer, all in one. But he did not make his age,\r\nwhich was an age of great men and of great things.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 14._ Had a sudden thought in church of a minister preaching in a\r\npulpit and a fiend waiting to carry him off to hell. Made some verses\r\nout of this.\r\n\r\n\"This is Whitsunday.... I do hope and pray for a fresh outpouring this\r\nyear. While I listened to Dr. Furness, two points grew clear to me: one\r\nwas, that I would hold my Peace Meeting, if I should hold it alone, as\r\na priest sometimes serves his mass. The second was, that I could preach\r\nfrom the text: 'As ye have borne the image of the earthy, so shall ye\r\nbear the image of the heavenly,' and this sermon I think I could preach\r\nto the prisoners, as I once tried to do years ago when dear Chev found\r\nthe idea so intolerable that I had to give it up. I am twenty years\r\nolder now, and the Woman Ministry is a recognized fact.\r\n\r\n\"Still Sunday afternoon. I am now full of courage for this week's heavy\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 30._ Alas! alas! dear Professor Rogers dropped dead to-day after\r\nsome exercise at the Institute of Technology. How he had helped me in\r\nthe Town and Country Club! Without his aid and that of his wife, I doubt\r\nwhether I could have started it at all: he was always vice-president as\r\nI was president. I cannot think how I can do without him.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 22._ Commemoration of Mr. Emerson at Concord Town Hall. Several\r\nportraits of him and very effective floral decorations; no music. Prayer\r\nby Rev. Dr. Holland; introductory remarks by F. B. Sanborn in which he\r\nquoted a good part of a poem by W. E. Channing, R. W. E. its theme. Then\r\ncame an unmercifully long paper by Dr. X., much of which was interesting\r\nand some of which was irrelevant. He insisted upon Mr. Emerson's having\r\nbeen an evolutionist, and unfolded a good deal of his own tablecloth\r\nalong with the mortuary napkin.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 29._ Had a studious and quiet day. Was in good time for the\r\nperformance [at the Casino]....\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to \"Uncle Sam\" she speaks of \"the labor and fatigue of\r\npreparing for the theatricals, which are happily over. We had rehearsals\r\nevery day last week. My part was a short one, but I took great pains to\r\nmake it as good as I could. Some points which I thought of on the spur\r\nof the moment added greatly to the fun of the impersonation. We had a\r\nfine house, and an enthusiastic reception. I had a floral tribute--only\r\nthink of it!--a basket of beautiful roses....\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 18._ Left Newport to attend Saratoga Convention, being\r\nappointed a delegate from the Channing Memorial Church, with its pastor,\r\nReverend C. W. Wendte.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 8._ Cousin Nancy Greene, my father's cousin, enters to-day\r\nupon her ninety-ninth year. I called to see her, going first to town to\r\nbuy her some little gift.... Had a very interesting talk with her. She\r\nwas nicely dressed in black, with a fresh cap and lilac ribbon, and a\r\nlittle silk handkerchief. For her this was quite an unusual toilette. I\r\nwished her a good year to come, but she said: 'Why should I want to live\r\nanother year? I can do nothing.' I suggested that she should dictate her\r\nreminiscences to the girl who waits upon her and who writes, she says, a\r\ngood hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 11._ I went to see the old Seventh Day Baptist Church, now\r\noccupied by the Newport Historical Society, in which my\r\ngreat-grandfather, Governor Samuel Ward, used to attend service....\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 24, Boston._ Spoke at the Home for Intemperate Women at 6\r\nP.M. I did my best. Text: 'Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth\r\nare named.' Subject: The Christian family; God, its father, all mankind\r\nbrothers and sisters.... Afterwards went to the Christmas 'Messiah.'\r\nFelt more sure than ever that no music so beautiful as this has ever\r\nbeen written.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n241 BEACON STREET: THE NEW ORLEANS EXPOSITION\r\n\r\n1883-1885; _aet._ 64-66\r\n\r\n  The full outpouring of power that stops at no frontier,\r\n  But follows _I would_ with _I can_, and _I can_ with _I do it_!\r\n\r\n                                                         J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1882-83 found her once more with a family of some size,\r\nher son and his wife joining forces with her at 241 Beacon Street. In\r\nHarry's college days, mother and son had made much music together; now\r\nthe old music books were unearthed, and the house resounded with the\r\nmelodies of Rossini and Handel. It was a gay household, with Crawford\r\nliving in the reception room on the ground floor; play was the order of\r\nthe evening, as work was of the day.\r\n\r\nThe new inmates brought new friends to the circle, men of science, the\r\ncolleagues of her beloved \"Bunko,\" now Professor Howe of the Institute\r\nof Technology, Italians, and other Europeans introduced by Crawford.\r\nThere was need of these new friends, for old ones were growing fewer.\r\nSide by side in the Journal with the mention of this one or that comes\r\nmore and more frequently the record of the passing of some dear\r\ncompanion on life's journey. Those who were left of the great band that\r\nmade New England glorious in the nineteenth century held closely to each\r\nother, and the bond between them had a touching significance. Across the\r\nstreet lived Oliver Wendell Holmes; in Cambridge was Thomas Wentworth\r\nHigginson; in Dorchester, Edward Everett Hale.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to her brother she speaks of \"the constant 'tear and trot'\r\nof my Boston life, in which I try to make all ends meet, domestic,\r\nsocial, artistic, and reformatory, and go about, I sometimes think, like\r\na poor spider who spins no web.... Marion has been very industrious, and\r\nis full of good work and of cheer. His book [\"Mr. Isaacs\"] has been such\r\na success as to give him at once a recognized position, of which the\r\nbest feature, economically, is that it enables him to command adequate\r\nand congenial employment at fairly remunerative prices....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To Laura_\r\n\r\nMY DARLING CHILD,--\r\n\r\nYour letter makes me say that I don't know anything, whether I have\r\nwritten or not, or ought to write, or not. Mammy's poor old head is very\r\nmuch worse than ever, and I don't get time even to read letters, some\r\ndays. I can't tell why, except that there are many points and people to\r\nbe reached, in one way and another, and I rush hither and thither,\r\naccomplishing, I fear, very little, but stirring many stews with my own\r\nspoon. It seems to me that I could not bear another winter of this\r\nstress and strain, which is difficult to analyze or account for, as \"she\r\nneedn't have done it, you know.\" Why she must do it, notwithstanding, is\r\nhard to tell, or what it is in doing it which so exhausts all nervous\r\nenergy and muscular strength. Now, darling, after this prelude in a\r\nminor key, let me thank heaven that, after all, I am well in health,\r\nand comfortable.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 10th, 2.20_ P.M. I wrote the above at noon, yesterday,\r\nexpecting Salvini to lunch.... Mrs. Appleton came in, and kept me, until\r\n2 minus 20 minutes, at which time, nearly beside myself with anxiety, I\r\ntumbled upstairs, out of one garment and into another. Such was my\r\ndressing. Salvini came and was charming. After luncheon came a\r\nreception. Your little girls were there, looking delightfully. Porter\r\nwas pleased to say that the little ones, hanging around the (old)\r\ngrandmother made a pleasing picture.... No more from 'fection\r\n\r\n                                                             MAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn later January she has \"a peaceful day at Vassar College.... In the\r\nafternoon met the teachers and read some poems, to wit, all of the\r\nEgyptian ones, and the poem on the Vestal dug up in Rome. At bedtime\r\nlast night I had a thought of ghosts. I spoke of this to Maria Mitchell\r\nto-day.

Of course, it is the old\r\nstory. I have been dreadfully busy with all sorts of work, in all of\r\nwhich I take delight, while yet to quote St. Paul, \"The good that I\r\nwould I do not.\" To give you a few items, I have just finished a short\r\nmemoir of Maria Mitchell, Professor of Astronomy at Vassar College. This\r\nwas an interesting task, but had to be very carefully done. At the same\r\ntime, I had to correct Maud's memoir of me, which is to be published in\r\nthe same collection of biographies of _eminent_ women! I think I am\r\neminent for undertaking ten times more than I can do, and doing about\r\none tenth of it. Well--I have given three Sunday preachments at a sort\r\nof Woman's church which they have here. My themes were: \"The Order of\r\nthe Natural and the Spiritual,\" \"Tares and Wheat,\" and \"The Power of\r\nReligion in the Life.\" I was in New York last Wednesday, to preside over\r\nthe mid-year Conference of the Woman's Congress.... I had a visit from\r\nSalvini the other day. He was most charming, and sent me a box for last\r\nevening's performance of \"The Outlaw,\" in Italian: \"Morte Civile.\" I\r\nwent, with my Harry and Laura, I in my best attire. I had received some\r\nvery beautiful roses, which I threw upon the stage, at the recall after\r\nthe third Act. To-day I met Wendell Phillips in the street, and made him\r\ncome in to see Marion, whose letter on English rule in India, printed in\r\nthe New York \"Tribune,\" he had liked very much. Phillips asked me how I\r\ncame to live in this part of the city, and I told him about your gift of\r\nthe house.... Marion is sitting by my fire, with Browning's \"Jocoseria\"\r\nin his hands, from which he has been reading passages. It sounds strange\r\nand silly....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _To the same_\r\n\r\n                                          OAK GLEN, May 10, 1883.\r\n\r\n... --I have been here alone all these days, with many gentle ghosts of\r\npast companionship, and with a task at which I work steadily every day.\r\nThis is a life of Margaret Fuller, rewritten mostly from the memoirs\r\nalready published, but also recast in my own thought. The publisher is\r\nin a hurry for it, and I have to work without intermission, _i.e._, as\r\nlong as I can, every day; but with all the diligence in my power, I\r\ncannot get along very rapidly. When I have finished my stint, I refresh\r\nmyself with a little Greek, and also with an Italian novel which I have\r\nbrought with me. The place looks lovely, and I sat, this afternoon, on\r\nthe western piazza, near that angle where you and I used to sit, last\r\nsummer, and enjoyed a bath of sunshine....\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                       OAK GLEN, August 21, 1883.\r\n\r\nMY MUCH NEGLECTED DARLING,--\r\n\r\nI give you to-day my first hour, or half-hour, as the case may be,\r\nfeeling that my long silence has been abominable, and must be broken,\r\neven if you should feel it to be your duty to throw an inkstand at my\r\nhead, in return for my letter. It is partly Backbone's fault. Backbone\r\nhas been so scrouged and put upon by the summer's work that he sometimes\r\ncuts up amazing. Said work is pretty well out of hand at this moment,\r\nthe last chapters of \"Margaret Fuller\" being ready for the press.... I\r\nhave so much felt the shocking uncharity of things in the way of diaries\r\nand letters which have been published within the last few years. Not the\r\nleast bad exhibition in this kind has been made by Carlyle and his wife.\r\nI have just finished reading the three volumes of her letters and\r\nmemorials, which were indeed interesting to me by the mention in them of\r\npersons whom I myself have known. Still, the spirit of the book is\r\npainful. It is sad to see how she adopted, at times, her husband's\r\nharsh creed. I should think Froude, the editor, must be wanting in\r\ncommon taste and decency, to have allowed the letters to appear in all\r\nthis crudeness. I am so glad that I never went near them, after that one\r\ntea-drink, a very bad one, forty years ago. Is this enough about the\r\nCarlyles? And is it strictly charitable? I dunno; I'm getting very old\r\nto know anything....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Life of Margaret Fuller\" (in Roberts Brothers' series of \"Famous\r\nWomen\") was a small book, yet it stood for much careful work, and was so\r\nrecognized and received. The recognition sometimes took a singular form,\r\n_e.g._, a letter from a gentleman styling himself \"Prof. Nat. & Geol.,\"\r\nwho desires two copies of the \"Margaret Fuller,\" and asks her to \"accept\r\nfor them a choice selection of '_Lithological_,' Cabinet of Geological\r\nMineral specimens, representing the Glacial, and Emptus period, also the\r\nCrystalline formation of the Earth's Strata, in Coolings, Rubbings, and\r\nScratchings of the Drift Age.\"\r\n\r\nThe exchange was not effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _To \"Uncle Sam\"_\r\n\r\n                                               December 15, 1883.\r\n\r\nDARLING BRO' SAM,--\r\n\r\nI must write you at once, or my silence will expand into a broad ocean\r\nwhich I shall be afraid to cross.... I have had a very laborious year,\r\nnow screwed to my desk, and working at _timed_ tasks, now travelling\r\nwidely, and scattering my spoken words.... Well, so much for desk-work,\r\nnow for the witch broomstick on which I fly. The Congress was held in\r\nChicago, in mid-October. From this place, I went to Minneapolis....\r\nHarry and his wife are here, paying handsomely their share of our\r\nrunning expenses. The little house looks friendly and comfortable, and I\r\nhope, after a few more flights, to enjoy it very much. These will now be\r\nvery short.... Boston is all alive with Irving's acting, Matthew\r\nArnold's lectures, Cable's readings, and the coming opera. _Père_\r\nHyacinthe also has been here, and a very eminent Hindoo, named Mozumdar.\r\nI have lost many of these doings by my journeys, but heard Arnold's\r\nlecture on Emerson last evening. I have also heard one of Cable's\r\nreadings. Arnold does not in the least understand Emerson, I think. He\r\nhas a positive, square-jawed English mind, with no super-sensible\r\n_aperçûs_. His elocution is pitiable, and when, after his lecture,\r\nWendell Phillips stepped forward and said a few graceful words of\r\nfarewell to him, it was like the Rose complimenting the Cabbage....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1883 closed with a climax of triumphant fatigue in the\r\nMerchants' and Mechanics' Fair, in which she was president of the\r\nWoman's Department. This was to lead to a far more serious undertaking\r\nin the autumn of 1884, that of the Woman's Department of the New Orleans\r\nExposition. The Journal may bridge the interval between the two.\r\n\r\n\"_February 3, 1884._ Wendell Phillips is dead.\r\n\r\n\"To speak at the meeting in memory of Cheshub Chunder Sen at Parker\r\nMemorial Hall. Heard T. W. Higginson and Mrs. Cheney. H. spoke at length\r\nof Phillips and said too much about his later mistakes, I thought,\r\nsaying nothing about his suffrage work, of which I took care to speak,\r\nwhen it was my turn. Several persons thanked me for my words, which\r\ntreated very briefly of Phillips's splendid services to humanity.\"\r\n\r\n[She spoke of him as \"the most finished orator of our time,\" and as \"the\r\nChrysostom of modern reform.\"]\r\n\r\n\"_February 6._ Wendell Phillips's funeral. I am invited to attend\r\nmemorial services at Faneuil Hall on Friday evening. I accept.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 9...._ I was very glad that I had come to this, the People's\r\nmeeting, and had been able to be heard in Faneuil Hall, the place of all\r\nothers where the _People_ should commemorate Wendell Phillips. My task\r\nwas to speak of his services to the cause of Woman. Others spoke of him\r\nin connection with Labor Reform, Anti-Slavery, Ireland, and Temperance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _To Laura_\r\n\r\nJust so, knowed you'd take advantage of my silence to write su'thin\r\nsaucy.

Pop comes\r\nyour letter--pop goes my repentance. \"She's got even with me,\" I said:\r\n\"If she went into a tailor's shop to get a cabbage leaf, to make an\r\napple pie, what does it matter by what initials she calls herself? Who's\r\ngoing to distress themselves about the set of her cloak? And she do\r\nboast about it preposterous, and that are a fact.\"\r\n\r\nHere endeth the first meditation, and I will now fall back upon the\r\n\"Dearly beloved,\" for the rest of the service....\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To the same_\r\n\r\n                            241 BEACON STREET, February 11, 1884.\r\n\r\n_Oh, thou, who art not quite a Satan!_\r\n\r\nQuestion is, dost thou not come very near it?...\r\n\r\nI have been very busy, and have _orated_ tremendous, this winter.

We had prepared three\r\nseparate bills, one providing that the mother shall have equal rights\r\nwith the father in their children, especially in determining their\r\nresidence and their education. A second ruling that on the wife's death,\r\nthe husband, who now gets all her real estate, may have one half, and\r\nthe children the other, and that the widow shall have the same right to\r\nhalf the husband's real estate after his death. A third bill was devised\r\nto enable husband and wife to contract valid money obligations toward\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the untiring efforts of the Suffragists these bills were all\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_March 27...._ I heard with dismay of the injury done to my Newport\r\nplace by the breaking of Norman's dam. Was very much troubled about\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                                  March 29, 1884.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST DARLING,--\r\n\r\nDunno why I hain't wrote you, 'cept that, while I was lame, the attitude\r\nof reclining with my foot extended was very fatiguing to me. The injury\r\nwas very slight. I only knocked my left foot pretty hard (_anglicé_,\r\nstubbed my toe) hurrying upstairs, but the weak left knee gave way, and\r\nturned, letting me down, and feloniously puffing itself up, which\r\nCharity never does. It could not be concealed from Maud, and so Beach\r\nwas sent for, and a fortnight of _stay still_ ordered and enforced. On\r\nTuesday last I broke bounds and railed it to Buffalo, New York, with my\r\ncrutches, which were no longer needed. This was for the mid-year\r\nConference of our Congress. Before I say more under this head, let me\r\ntell you that I returned from Buffalo this morning, much the better for\r\nmy trip. I had a lovely visit there, in a most friendly and comfortable\r\nhouse, with carriages at my disposition. A beautiful luncheon was given\r\nto us Congressers and I gave a lecture on Thursday evening, price $50,\r\nand sat in a high chair, thinking it not prudent to stand so long....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_April 4._ In the latter part of the eighteenth century a Christian\r\nmissionary, Chinese, but disguised as a Portuguese, penetrated into\r\nCorea, and was much aided in his work by the courageous piety of Columba\r\nKang, wife of one of the lesser nobles. She and the missionary suffered\r\ntorture and death.... Merchants, not diplomatists, are the true apostles\r\nof civilization.\r\n\r\n\"Questions for A.A.W.

He spoke of the\r\nnegroes as individually quick-witted and capable, but powerless in\r\nassociation and deficient in organizing power. This struck me as the\r\nnatural consequence of their long subjection to despotic power. The\r\nexigencies of slavery quickened their individual perceptions, and\r\nsharpened their wits, but left them little opportunity for concerted\r\naction. Freedom allows men to learn how to coöperate widely and strongly\r\nfor ends of mutual good. Despotism heightens personal consciousness\r\nthrough fear of danger, but itself fears nothing so much as association\r\namong men, which it first prohibits and in time renders impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 15._ A delightful Easter. I felt this day that, in my\r\ndifficulties with the Anti-Suffragists, the general spread of Christian\r\nfeeling gives me ground to stand upon. The charity of Christendom will\r\nnot persist in calumniating the Suffragists, nor will its sense of\r\njustice long refuse to admit their claims.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 17._ Sam Eliot was in a horse-car, and told me that Tom Appleton\r\nhad died of pneumonia in New York. The last time I spoke with him was in\r\none of these very cars. He asked me if I had been to the funeral,\r\nmeaning that of Wendell Phillips. I was sure that he had been much\r\nimpressed by it. I saw him once more, on Commonwealth Avenue on a bitter\r\nday. He walked feebly and was much bent. I did not stop to speak with\r\nhim which I now regret. He was very friendly to me, yet the sight of me\r\nseemed to rouse some curious vein of combativeness in him. He had many\r\nprecious qualities, and had high views of character, although he was\r\nsometimes unjust in his judgments of other people, particularly of the\r\ncome-outer reformers.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 19._ To get some flowers to take to T. G. A.'s house. Saw him\r\nlying placid in his coffin, robed in soft white cashmere, with his\r\npalette and brushes in his hands....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _To Florence_\r\n\r\n                                                  April 20, 1884.\r\n\r\n... I went yesterday to poor Tom Appleton's funeral. It is very sad to\r\nlose him, and every one says that a great piece of the old Boston goes\r\nwith him.... I dined with George William Curtis yesterday at Mrs. Harry\r\nWilliams's. George William was one of Tom Appleton's pall-bearers,--so\r\nwere Dr. Holmes and Mr. Winthrop....\r\n\r\nCurtis's oration on Wendell Phillips was very fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_April 20._ Thought sadly of errors and shortcomings. At church a\r\npenitential psalm helped me much, and the sermon more. I felt assured\r\nthat, whatever may be my fate beyond this life, I should always seek,\r\nlove, and rejoice in the good. Thus, even in hell, one might share by\r\nsympathy the heavenly victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 5._ I begin in great infirmity of spirit a week which brings many\r\ntasks. First, I must proceed in the matter of Norman's injury to my\r\nestate, either to a suit or a settlement by arbitration unless I can\r\npreviously come to an understanding with N.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA heavy affliction was soon to drive all other thoughts from her mind.\r\nOn May 19, a telegram arrived from Italy saying, \"Samuel Ward expired\r\npeacefully.\"\r\n\r\nShe writes: \"Nothing could be more unexpected than this blow. Dear Bro'\r\nSam had long since been pronounced out of danger.... Latterly we have\r\nheard of him as feeble, and have felt renewed anxiety, but were entirely\r\nunprepared for his death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_May 20._ Dark days of nothingness these, to-day and yesterday. Nothing\r\nto do but be patient and explore the past.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 21._ Had a sitting all alone with dear Uncle Sam's picture this\r\nafternoon. I thought it might be the time of his funeral. I read the\r\nbeautiful 90th Psalm and a number of his bright, sweet lyrics. A\r\nsympathetic visit from Winthrop Chanler.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 27...._ Dear Brother Sam's death has brought me well in sight of\r\nthe farther shore. May I be ready when it is my turn to cross.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To her sister Louisa_\r\n\r\nDEAREST SISTER,--\r\n\r\nI was already in debt to you for one good letter when this later one\r\narrived, giving me the full, desired particulars of our dear one's last\r\ndays on earth. You and Annie both write as though the loss were heaviest\r\nto me, and I only feel that I cannot feel it half enough. The pathos of\r\na life of such wonderful vicissitudes! I cannot half take it in. What\r\nmust he not have suffered in those lonely days of wandering and\r\nprivation, while I was comfortable in my household!... God knows, I had\r\nevery reason to love him, for he was heroically faithful to his\r\naffection for me. Now, I feel how little I appreciated his devotion, and\r\nhow many chimeras, in my foolish wool-gathering head, crowded upon this\r\nmost precious affection, which was worthy of a much larger place in my\r\nthoughts. His death is a severe loss to Maud and me.... We were always\r\nhoping to rejoin him, and to pass some happy years with him. A great\r\nobject is withdrawn from our two lives. Nothing can take his place to\r\neither of us.... As I write, the tears come. Like you, I long to sit\r\nand talk it all over with the two who are all I have left of my own\r\ngeneration. To our children, the event cannot be at all what it is to\r\nus. They are made for the future, and our day is not theirs. I was\r\ncomforted, in your first letter, in reading of that pleasant, quiet talk\r\nyou had with him, when, among other things, you read to him the lovely\r\nverses from St. John's Gospel, which have become a classic of\r\nconsolation among Christian people. I believe that he is in the heaven\r\naccorded to those who have loved their fellow-men, for who ever coined\r\npure kindness into acts as he did? One of the lessons I learn from his\r\nlife is that it is very hard for us to judge rightly the merits and\r\ndemerits of others. Here was a man with many faults on the surface, and\r\na heart of pure gold beneath.... The thought of his lonely funeral and\r\nsolitary grave has wrung my heart at times, but sometimes I think of it\r\nas a place where one might be glad to be at rest.... But now, dear, I\r\nhave had all the heart-break I can bear, writing this letter. Let me now\r\nspeak of the living and tell you where and how we are.... I left very\r\nunwillingly to come down here, and try to get my poor wrecked place in\r\norder. You know, of course, that the dam which was built to cut off my\r\nwater, and against which I obtained an injunction, burst this spring,\r\nand destroyed my two ponds, my carriage, and a good part of my barn. I\r\nhave tried, in a lumbering way, to get justice, but have not yet\r\nsucceeded. I have had, too, a great deal of trouble in my presidency of\r\nthe Woman's Congress, this year. Almost as soon as I open my eyes in\r\nthe morning, these black dogs of worry spring upon me. I long to be\r\nfree from them....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_June 28._ Senator Bayard to William A. Duncan about dear Bro' Sam: 'It\r\nis just one of those little kindnesses of which his life was so full.\r\nThere is no doubt, as you say, that his later years were his best! The\r\nwine of life fined itself.... He was readily sympathetic, and did in\r\nRome as Romans did, and kept time and tune to a great variety of\r\ninstruments. But the kind good heart _always beat truly_, and the array\r\nof good deeds to his credit in the great book of account is delightful\r\nto think of.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                        NEWPORT, August 15, 1884.\r\n\r\nHaven't I written to you?

Do not see any\r\ndifference between one thing and another. This, I should think, must\r\ncome from a vagary of the liver. Worst sort of nervous prostration--to\r\nprostrate one's self before one's nerves.

A rare and delightful occasion.\r\nJefferson talked much about art. He, Booth, and Warren all told little\r\nanecdotes of forgetfulness on the stage. Jefferson had told a love-story\r\ntwice, Booth had twice given the advice to the players [in \"Hamlet\"],\r\nWarren, in 'Our American Cousin,' should have tried to light a match\r\nwhich would not light. He inadvertently turned the ignitable side, which\r\ntook fire, and so disconcerted him that he forgot where he was in the\r\nplay and had to ask some one what he had last said, which being told him\r\nenabled him to go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 25._ Finished to-day my Congress paper. I have written this\r\npaper this week instead of going to the Unitarian Convention, which I\r\nwished much to attend....

You unwind a little and straightway come to an end. The wonder is,\r\nthere are so many ends. Here is a precise picture of our days as passed\r\nat present. Morning, I wake early, lie and think over my past life, with\r\nlittle satisfaction. Bathe. Breakfast. Walk with Maud, Sonny[95] tugging\r\nalongside. Maud goes much further than I do. Sonny and I return, take a\r\nbasket and gather dry twigs to brighten the evening fire. I visit my\r\nmare in her stable--a good custom, as my man is not over-careful of her\r\nstall. Maud comes back, I _exercise_ her voice. I go to books, she to\r\ndesk. Study Greek a good deal, reading Thucydides and Aristophanes.\r\nDinner, coffee, more reading and writing, unless we go to town. Evening,\r\nmusic, reading or cards, worrying about ----, bed. I have not mentioned\r\nmy own much writing, because you will understand it. I am trying to\r\ncompass a story, but have my fears about it. My paper for the Woman's\r\nCongress is entitled \"How to broaden the Views of Society Women.\"\r\nDarling dear, what more can I tell you? Isn't this too much already?\r\nNow, do spunk up and have some style about you.... Be cheerful and\r\nresolute, my love, life comes but once, and is soon over....\r\n\r\n  [95] John Howe Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_October 13._ To New Bedford, for the Suffrage meeting; trains did not\r\nconnect at Myricks, where, after some delay and negotiation, I with\r\ndifficulty persuaded the conductor of a freight train to take me to New\r\nBedford in his caboose. This saved me time enough to go to the Delano\r\nMansion, restore my strength with food, and put on my cap and ruche. The\r\nDelanos were very kind. I read my Congress paper on 'Benefits of\r\nSuffrage to Women.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 23._ To Louisburg Square to my old friend's funeral [Hamilton\r\nWilde].... Around and before me were the friends and associates of the\r\ngolden time in which his delightful humor and _bonhomie_ so often helped\r\nme in charades and other high times. It was ghostly--there were Lizzie\r\nHomans and Jerry Abbott, who took part with him and William Hunt in the\r\nwonderful charade in which the two artists rode a tilt with theatre\r\nhobbies. The gray heads which I had once seen black, brown, or blond,\r\nheightened the effect of the picture. It was indeed a _sic transit_. I\r\nsaid to Charles Perkins--'For some of us, it is the dressing bell!' Oh!\r\nthis mystery! So intense, so immense a fact and force as human life,\r\ntapering to this little point of a final leave-taking and brief\r\nremembrance!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNow came the New Orleans Exposition, in which she was to be chief of the\r\nWoman's Department.\r\n\r\nIt was already late when she received the appointment, but she lost no\r\ntime. Establishing her headquarters at No. 5 Park Street (for many years\r\nthe home of the \"Woman's Journal\" and the New England Woman's Club), she\r\nsent out circulars to every State in the Union, asking for exhibits, and\r\nappealed to the editors of newspapers all over the country to send women\r\ncorrespondents for a month or more to the Exposition. She called\r\nmeetings in Boston, New York, Providence, Philadelphia, and Hartford, at\r\nall of which she spoke, imploring the women to bestir themselves, and,\r\nlate as it was, to make an effort to get together a proper showing of\r\nwomen's work for the great Fair.\r\n\r\nBeside all this, she kept up through the autumn an active correspondence\r\nwith the Exposition authorities at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe Exposition was scheduled to open on the 1st of December: it did\r\nactually open on the 16th. She writes:--\r\n\r\n\"A steamer had been chartered to convey thither the officers of the\r\nExposition and their invited guests. Seated on the deck, the chief of\r\nthe Woman's Department and her fellow-workers watched the arrival of the\r\nhigh dignitaries of the State and city, escorted by members of the\r\nmilitary, and by two bands of music; one, the famous Mexican Band. All\r\nthe craft on the river were adorned with flags and streamers. The\r\nCrescent, which gives the city its familiar designation, was pointed\r\nout, and the 'Father of Waters' was looked upon with admiring eyes. The\r\nsteamer brought us to the Exposition grounds, and here a procession was\r\nformed in which the ladies of the Woman's Department were assigned a\r\nplace which they had some difficulty in keeping. The march led to the\r\nMain Building. The opening prayer was made by the Reverend De Witt\r\nTalmage. At a given moment a telegram was received from the President of\r\nthe United States, Chester A. Arthur, declaring the Exposition to be\r\nformally open. Immediately after, the son of the Director-General, a\r\nfine lad of twelve years, touched the electric button by which the\r\nmachinery of the Exposition was set in motion.\r\n\r\n\"Returning by land, we found the streets gay with decorations, in which\r\nthe colors of the orthodox flag were conspicuous.\"\r\n\r\nMaud was with her, and shared her labors, as did her devoted friend\r\nIsabel Greeley. At this time the floor of the gallery destined for the\r\nwomen's exhibit was not laid. By December 29 the officers of the\r\ndepartment were able to hold a meeting in \"an enclosure without doors or\r\nsuitable furniture.\" When all was supposed to be ready for the exhibits,\r\nit was found that the roof leaked badly, the timber having so shrunk\r\nunder the action of the sun as to tear away the waterproof felting.\r\nMoreover, there was not enough money to carry on the business of the\r\nDepartment. Funds had been promised by the Board of Management, but\r\nthese funds were not forthcoming, the Board itself being in\r\ndifficulties. Our mother had foreseen this contingency.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies,\" she said, \"we must remember that women have sometimes built\r\nchurches with no better instruments than thimbles and a teapot! If the\r\nworst comes to the worst, we must come before the public and endeavor\r\nwith its aid to earn the money necessary to complete our enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nThis foreboding soon became a fact, and early in January she found\r\nherself in rather a \"tight corner.\" She had sent out the call for\r\nexhibits to every State in the Union; with great effort the women of the\r\ncountry had responded most generously. She now felt herself personally\r\nresponsible for these exhibits, and determined that, _coûte que coûte_,\r\nthey should be well displayed and the Woman's Department properly\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\nThere was no money: very well! she would earn some. She arranged a\r\nseries of entertainments, beginning with a lecture by herself. There\r\nfollowed a time of great stress and anxiety, which taxed to the utmost\r\nher mother-wit and power of invention. Faculties hitherto dormant awoke\r\nto meet the task; she devised practical, hard, common-sense methods, far\r\nremoved from her life habit of intellectual labor. She had moved into a\r\nnew apartment in the house of life, one nearer the earth and not quite\r\nso near the stars. She often quoted during these months Napoleon's\r\nsaying, on being told that something he wished to do was impossible,\r\n\"_Ne me dîtes pas ce bête de mot!_\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of endless vexations, it was a time of tremendous enjoyment;\r\nevery nerve was strained, every gift exercised; the cup of life was\r\nbrimming over, even if it was not all filled with honey.\r\n\r\n\"_January 13, 1885._ Preparing for my lecture this evening. Subject, 'Is\r\nPolite Society Polite?' Place, Werlein Hall. I was very anxious--the\r\nlecture appeared to me very homely for a Southern audience accustomed to\r\nrhetorical productions. My reception was most gratifying. The house was\r\npacked and many were sent away. Judge Gayarré introduced me. Joaquin\r\nMiller came first, reciting his 'Fortunate Isles.' I said in opening\r\nthat even if my voice should not fill the hall, my good-will embraced\r\nthem all. Every point in the lecture was perceived and applauded, and I\r\nfelt more than usually in sympathy with my audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"The second entertainment devised for the relief of the Woman's\r\nDepartment was a '_Soirée Créole_,' the third and last a 'grand musical\r\n_matinée_' at the French Opera House, for which we were indebted to the\r\ngreat kindness of Colonel Mapleson, who granted us the use of the house,\r\nand by whose permission several of his most distinguished artists gave\r\ntheir services. Monsignor Gillow, Commissioner for Mexico, also allowed\r\nhis band to perform.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of persuading the different artists to sing, of pacifying\r\ntheir separate agents in the matter of place on the programme and size\r\nof the letters in which names were advertised, of bringing harmony out\r\nof all the petty rivalries and cabals between the different members of\r\nthe troupe, required a patience worthy of a better cause. Meanwhile\r\nthere were other troubles. Most of the women commissioners appointed by\r\nthe different States proved loyal comrades to their chief in her great\r\nand distressful labor; but there were others who gave her endless\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_February 6._ Our concert. The weather was favorable. Lieutenant Doyle\r\ncame to escort me to the theatre. My box was made quite gay by the\r\nuniforms of several navy officers. The house was packed. We took $1500\r\nand hope to have more. I particularly enjoyed the _Semiramide_ overture,\r\nwhich the band gave grandly. Rossini's soul seemed to me to blossom out\r\nof it like an immortal flower.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese entertainments brought in over two thousand dollars. This money\r\nenabled the women to install such exhibits as were ready, to pay for a\r\ntime the necessary workmen, and to engage a special police force for the\r\nprotection of their goods. The United States ships in the harbor also\r\nespoused the cause, Admiral Jouett, of the flagship Tennessee, and\r\nCaptain Kane, of the Galena, sending experienced craftsmen whose ready\r\nand skilful work soon changed the somewhat desolate aspect of the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements were as simple as might be, the greatest expense being\r\nthe purchase of showcases. The tables were of rough pine boards covered\r\nwith cambrics and flannels, the draperies of the simplest and cheapest,\r\nthe luxury of a carpet was enjoyed only here and there; but the\r\nexcellence of the exhibits, and the taste with which they were\r\ndisplayed, made the department a pleasant place. The winter was cold;\r\nthe wooden walls of the Government Building let in many a chilling\r\nblast; but there was a stove in the office of the chief of installation,\r\nand with its help the daily cup of tea was made which kept the workers\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nEach State and Territory had a separate opening day for its exhibit.\r\nThese days were marked by public meetings at which compliments were\r\nexchanged, addresses made, and the exhibits turned over to the\r\nmanagement. It was considered obligatory for all the commissioners to\r\nattend these meetings, and the women spent many weary hours trying to\r\nhear the addresses of distinguished individuals whose voices contended\r\nin vain with the din of the machinery. The Mexican Band played, and\r\nrelieved the tedium of the long sittings; but the women commissioners\r\nwere upheld chiefly by the feeling that they were drawn together from\r\nall parts of the country, and were taking an honored part in a great\r\nindustrial and peaceful pageant, whose results would be important to the\r\ncountry and to mankind at large.\r\n\r\nThe Journal tells in February of the \"opening of the colored people's\r\ndepartment; very interesting. A numerous assemblage of them showed a\r\nwide range of types. Music, military, drumming especially good. Saw in\r\ntheir exhibit a portrait of John A. Andrew which looked like a greeting\r\nfrom the old heroic time.\"\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Department was formally opened on March 3, though it had\r\nreally been open to the public since early January. The day was one of\r\nthe gayest in the history of the Exposition. The gallery of the\r\nGovernment Building was bright with flowers and gay with flags. Admiral\r\nJouett had sent the ship's band as a special compliment; the music was\r\ndelightful, the speeches excellent. We quote from Mrs. Howe's address:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish to speak of the importance, in an industrial point of view, of a\r\ndistinct showing of women's work in the great industrial exhibits. There\r\nare few manufactures in which the hand and brain of woman have not their\r\nappointed part. So long, however, as this work is shown merely in\r\nconjunction with that of men, it is dimly recognized, and makes no\r\ndistinct impression. The world remains very imperfectly educated\r\nconcerning its women. They are liable to be regarded as a non-producing\r\nclass, supported by those to whom, in the order of nature, their life is\r\na necessary condition of existence itself.... Exhibits like the present,\r\nthen, are useful in summing up much of this undervalued work of women. A\r\ngreater moral use they have in raising the standard of usefulness and\r\nactivity for the sex in general. Good work, when recognized, acts as a\r\nspur to human energy. Those who show how women can excel are examples to\r\nshame those who do not try. They lay upon their sex an obligation to\r\nstronger endeavor and better action, and society gains thereby.\r\n\r\n\"Still more have I at heart the association, in these enterprises, of\r\nwomen who are not bound to each other by alliance of blood, or affinity\r\nof neighborhood. Greater and more important than the acquisition of\r\nskill is the cultivation of public spirit. '_Pro bono publico_' is a\r\nmotto whose meaning men should learn from their infancy, and at their\r\nfiresides. How shall they learn it unless the women, the guardian\r\nspirits of the household, shall hold and teach, beyond all other\r\ndoctrines, that of devotion and loyalty to the public good?\r\n\r\n\"I value, then, for the sake of both men and women, the disinterested\r\nassociation of women for the promotion of the great interests of\r\nsociety....\r\n\r\n\"You were stirred the other day by the bringing back of a battle-flag\r\nwhose rents had been carefully mended. I tell you, sisters, we have all\r\none flag now, broad and bright enough to cover us all. Let us see that\r\nno rent is made in it.\r\n\r\n\"All that the best and wisest men can imagine for the good of the human\r\nrace can be wrought if the best women will only help the best men.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of her most arduous tasks was the arranging of a course of\r\ntwenty-four \"Twelve-o'Clock Talks,\" which were given every Saturday from\r\nthe middle of February till the close of the Exposition. How she labored\r\nover them her companion daughter well remembers: remembers too what\r\nsuccess crowned the effort. The subjects varied widely. Captain Bedford\r\nPym, R.N., discoursed on Arctic explorations; Charles Dudley Warner told\r\nthe story of the Elmira Reformatory; the Japanese Commissioner spoke of\r\nwoman's work in Japanese literature. These talks were free to the\r\npublic, and proved so popular that eight years later the same plan was\r\ncarried out in the Woman's Department of the Chicago World's Fair, and\r\nagain proved its excellence and value.\r\n\r\nAs if all this were not enough, she must found a Literary Association\r\namong the young people of New Orleans. She named them the Pans, and\r\namong their number were several whose names have since become well known\r\nin literature. Grace King, Elizabeth Bisland, and others will remember\r\nthose evenings, when their bright youth flashed responsive to the call\r\nof the elder woman of letters.\r\n\r\nIn all the stress and hurry, we find this entry:--\r\n\r\n\"My dear father's birthday. I left the Exposition early and walked to\r\nvisit dear Marion's grave in Girard Street Cemetery. A lovely place it\r\nwas. He is buried above ground in a sort of edifice formed of brick, the\r\nrows of coffins being laid on stone floors, each single one divided from\r\nthose on either side of it by a stone partition. 'Francis Marion Ward,\r\ndied September 3rd, 1847.' Erected by William Morse, dear Marion's\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_May 16._ Gave my talk to the colored people, soon after two in the\r\nafternoon in their department. A pretty hexagonal platform had been\r\narranged. Behind this was a fine portrait of Abraham Lincoln, with a\r\nvase of beautiful flowers [gladiolus and white lilies] at its base. I\r\nspoke of Dr. Channing, Garrison, Theodore Parker, Charles Sumner, John\r\nA. Andrew, Lucretia Mott, and Wendell Phillips, occupying about an hour.\r\nThey gave me a fine basket of flowers and sang my 'Battle Hymn.'\r\nAfterwards the Alabama cadets visited us. We gave them tea, cake and\r\nbiscuits and I made a little speech for them.\"\r\n\r\nWinter and spring passed rapidly, each season bringing fresh interest.\r\nThe picturesqueness of New Orleans, the many friends she made among its\r\npeople, the men and women gathered from every corner of the world, well\r\nmade up to her for the vexations which inevitably attended her position.\r\nLooking back on these days, she said of them: \"It was like having a big,\r\nbig Nursery to administer, with children good, bad, and middling. The\r\ngood prevailed in the end, as it usually or always does, and yet I used\r\nto say that Satan had a fresh flower for me every morning, when I came\r\nto my office, and took account of the state of things.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulties with which the unfortunate managers were struggling\r\nmade it impossible for them to keep their promises of financial support\r\nto the Woman's Department. Things went from bad to worse. Finally she\r\nrealized that she herself must find the money to pay the debts of her\r\ndepartment and to return the exhibits to the various States. She wrote a\r\nletter to John M. Forbes, of Boston, urging him to help her and her\r\nassistants out of their alarming predicament. Through Mr. Forbes, the\r\nHonorable George F. Hoar, Senator from Massachusetts, learned the state\r\nof the case. The sum of $15,000 had been named as that necessary to pay\r\nall just claims and wind up the affairs of the Department. At this time\r\na bill was before Congress for an appropriation to aid the Exposition.\r\nThanks to the efforts of Mr. Hoar, a sum of $15,000 was added to this\r\nbill with the express clause, \"For the Relief of the Woman's\r\nDepartment.\" The bill was passed without discussion. The news was\r\nreceived with great rejoicing in New Orleans, especially in the Woman's\r\nDepartment, \"where our need was the sorest.\" The promise brought new\r\nlife to the weary workers; but they were to be far more weary before the\r\nend. The Exposition closed on the last day of May. Summer was upon them;\r\nthe Northern women, unused to the great heats of New Orleans, longed to\r\nclose up their business and depart, but the money had not come from\r\nCongress, and they could not leave their post. Days dragged on; days of\r\ntorrid, relentless heat. Our mother must borrow money for the Department\r\nhere and there to bridge over the gap between promise and fulfilment.\r\nWorn out by fatigue, anxiety, and the great heat, she fell seriously\r\nill. Those nearest her begged her to go home and leave to others the\r\nfinal settlement of affairs, but she would not hear of this. She would\r\nget well: she _must_ get well! Rallying her forces, mental and physical,\r\nshe did get well, though her illness for a time seemed desperate.\r\n\r\nAt long last, when June was nearly half over, the money came, and with\r\nit the end of her long task. Accounts were audited, checks drawn,\r\nexhibits despatched; and with farewell greetings and congratulations,\r\n\"the whole weary matter ended.\" Her report as President of the Woman's\r\nDepartment tells the story:\r\n\r\n\"The business of the Woman's Department having thus been brought\r\nsuccessfully to a close, it only remains for its President to resign the\r\noffice she has filled, with some pain and much pleasure, for more than\r\nsix months,--to thank the officers of her staff for their able and\r\nfaithful services, the vice-presidents, and the lady commissioners in\r\ngeneral, for the friendly support she has had from them almost without\r\nexception....\r\n\r\n\"The classification by States she considers to have justified itself,\r\npartly through the more distinct knowledge thus gained of the work of\r\nwomen in localities widely distant from each other, partly in the good\r\nacquaintance and good-will developed by this method of work. The\r\nfriendly relations growing out of it still bind together those who are\r\nnow thousands of miles apart, but who, we may hope, will ever remain\r\nunited in a common zeal for promoting the industrial interests of women.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, she would say that she considers herself happy in having taken\r\npart in an Exposition of so high and useful a character as that which\r\nhas latterly made New Orleans a centre of interest in the civilized\r\nworld. She takes leave with regret of a city in which she has enjoyed\r\nmuch friendly intercourse and hospitality; a city in whose renewed\r\nprosperity she must henceforth feel a deep and lasting interest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                         OAK GLEN, July 19, 1885.\r\n\r\nHow I left New Orleans, how I came North, how I let myself down here, is\r\nno doubt known to you thro' inference. How hot New Orleans was before I\r\nleft it, you cannot know, nor how sick I was once upon a time, nor how I\r\ncame up upon iced champagne and recovered myself, and became strong\r\nagain. Ever since I came home, I have slaved at my report of the\r\nWoman's Department. Weary pages have I written. Life seems at last to\r\nconsist in putting a pen into an inkstand, and taking it out again,\r\nscribble, scribble, nibble, nibble (meal-times), and go to bed between\r\nwhiles....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo ended one of the most interesting and arduous experiences of her\r\nlife.

Of course, I meant to write you immediately afterward in a\r\nseparate envelope, telling you that I still love you. But there! I\r\nreflected that you could have a bad feeling if you opened the envelope\r\nand found no greeting from me. For the sake of posterity, Madam, I\r\ndeclined to give you this bad feeling.

W. PARSONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years 1886 and 1887 were marked by two events which changed\r\nmaterially the course of her private life: the death of Julia, the\r\nbeloved eldest daughter, and the marriage of Maud, the house-mate and\r\ncomrade.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1885-86 she made her headquarters in New York.\r\nLecture engagements, conferences, and sermons took her hither and\r\nthither, and much of the time that should have been \"precious\" was\r\npassed in trains and boats.\r\n\r\nIn the last days of February, Julia was stricken with rheumatic fever,\r\nwhich soon developed into typhoid. The weather was \"direful: bitter cold\r\nand furious wind.\" Our mother went at once to South Boston, where\r\n\"arriving, found my dear child seriously but not dangerously ill. Her\r\njoy at my coming was very pathetic.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot be sure whether it was on this day that she said to me:\r\n'Mamma, don't you remember the dream you had when Flossy and I were\r\nlittle children, and you were in Europe? You dreamed that you saw us in\r\na boat and that the tide was carrying us away from you. Now the dream\r\nhas come true, and the tide is bearing me away from you.'\r\n\r\n\"This saying was very sad to me; but my mind was possessed with the\r\ndetermination that death was not to be thought of.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time conditions seemed to improve, and she hastened to New York,\r\nwhere her presence was imperative; but a telegram summoned her back:\r\nJulia was not so well, and \"a pain as of death\" fell on the anxious\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"Saw by Katie's face when she opened the door that things were worse. I\r\nflew up the stairs and found my darling little changed, except that her\r\nbreathing seemed rather worse. She was so glad to see me!... About this\r\ntime I noticed a change come over her sweet face.... I felt, but would\r\nnot believe, that it was the beginning of the end. Julia was presently\r\nvery happy, with Michael on one side of her and myself on the other.\r\nEach of us held a hand. She said: 'I am very happy now: if one has\r\none's parents and one's husband, what more can one want?' And presently,\r\n'The angels have charge of me now, mamma and Mimy.'[98] She said to me:\r\n'What does the Lord want to kill me for? I am dying.' I said, 'No, my\r\ndarling, you are going to get well.' She said: 'Remember, if anything\r\nhappens to me, you two must stay together.'... A little later Michael\r\nand I were alone with her. She began to wander, and talk as if with\r\nreference to her club or some such thing. 'If this is not the right\r\nthing,' she said, 'call another priestess'; then, very emphatically:\r\n'Truth, truth.' These were her last words.\r\n\r\n  [98] Michael.\r\n\r\n\"My darling should have been forty-two years old this day....\"\r\n\r\nA few days later she writes to Mary Graves:--\r\n\r\n\"I am not wild, nor melancholy, nor inconsolable, but I feel as America\r\nmight if some great, fair State were blotted from its map, leaving only\r\na void for the salt and bitter sea to overwhelm. I cannot, so far, get\r\nany comfort from other worldly imaginings. If God says anything to me\r\nnow, he says, 'Thou fool.' The truth is that we have no notion of the\r\nvalue and beauty of God's gifts until they are taken from us. Then He\r\nmay well say: 'Thou fool,' and we can only answer to our name.\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal says:--\r\n\r\n\"This is the last day of this sorrowful March which took my dear one\r\nfrom me. I seem to myself only dull, hard, and confused under this\r\naffliction. I pray God to give me comfort by raising me up that I may\r\nbe nearer to the higher life into which she and her dear father have\r\npassed. And thou? _eleison_....\"\r\n\r\n\"Have had an uplifting of soul to-day. Have written to Mary Graves: 'I\r\nam at last getting to stand where I can have some spiritual outlook.'\r\nThe confusion of 'is not' is giving place to the steadfastness of 'is.'\r\nHave embodied my thoughts in a poem to my dear Julia and in some pages\r\nwhich I may read at the meeting intended to commemorate her by the New\r\nEngland Woman's Club.\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal of this spring is full of tender allusions to the beloved\r\ndaughter. The dreams of night often brought back the gracious figure;\r\nthese visions are accurately described, each detail dwelt on with loving\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Reminiscences\" she tells of Julia's consecrated life, of her\r\ndevotion to her father, and to the blind pupils; describes, too, her\r\npleasure in speaking at the Concord School of Philosophy (where her\r\n\"mind seemed to have found its true level\") and in a Metaphysical Club\r\nof her own founding.\r\n\r\n\"It was beautiful to see her seated in the midst of this thoughtful\r\ncircle, which she seemed to rule with a staff of lilies. The club was\r\none in which diversity of opinion sometimes brought individuals into\r\nsharp contrast with each other; but her gentle government was able to\r\nbring harmony out of discord, and to subdue alike the crudeness of\r\nscepticism and the fierceness of intolerance.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Reminiscences\" we find also the record of Julia's parting\r\ninjunction to her husband: \"Be kind to the little blind children, for\r\nthey are papa's children.\"\r\n\r\n\"These parting words,\" our mother adds, \"are inscribed on the wall of\r\nthe Kindergarten for the Blind at Jamaica Plain. Beautiful in life, and\r\nmost beautiful in death, her sainted memory has a glory beyond that of\r\nworldly fame.\"\r\n\r\nShe considered Julia the most gifted of her children. The\r\n\"Reminiscences\" speak of her at some length, making mention of her\r\nbeneficent life, and of her published works, a volume of poems entitled\r\n\"Stray Chords,\" and \"Philosophiæ Quæstor,\" a slender volume in which she\r\ndescribed the Concord School of Philosophy and her pleasure therein.\r\n\r\nIn our mother's house of life, each child had its special room, though\r\nno door was locked to any. In all things pertaining to philosophy, Julia\r\nwas her special intimate. For help and sympathy in suffrage and club\r\ndoings, she turned naturally to Florence, an ardent worker in these\r\nfields; with Harry she would specially enjoy music; with Laura would\r\ntalk of books; while Maud was the \"Prime Minister\" in social and\r\nhousehold matters. So, till the very last, we gray-haired children\r\nleaned on her, clung to her, as in the days when we were children\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nA few years before Julia's death, our mother wrote to Mrs. Cheney, who\r\nhad lost her only daughter: \"This combat of the soul with deadly sorrow\r\nis a single-handed one, so far as human help is concerned. I do believe\r\nthat God's sweet angels are with us when we contend against the extreme\r\nof calamity.\"\r\n\r\nHeavy as this affliction was, it brought none of the paralysis of grief\r\ncaused by Sammy's death: rather, as after the passing of the Chevalier,\r\nshe was urged by the thought of her dead child to more and higher\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nIn the quiet of Oak Glen she wrote this summer a careful study of Dante\r\nand Beatrice, for the Concord School of Philosophy.[99] July 20 found\r\nher at Concord, where she and Julia had been wont to go together. She\r\nsays, \"I cannot think of the sittings of the School without a vision of\r\nthe rapt expression of her face as she sat and listened to the various\r\nspeakers.\"[100]\r\n\r\n  [99] This was a summer school of ten years (1879-88) in which Emerson,\r\n  Alcott, and W. T. Harris took part.\r\n\r\n  [100] _Reminiscences_, p. 440.\r\n\r\nSpite of her grief in missing this sweet companionship she found the\r\nsessions of the School deeply interesting. She was \"much more nervous\r\nthan usual\" about her lecture; which \"really sounded a good deal better\r\nthan it had looked to me. It was wonderfully well received.\"\r\n\r\nWe are told by the last living representative of the School of\r\nPhilosophy, Mr. F. B. Sanborn, that she was the most attractive, and\r\nsometimes the most profound, of its lecturers; \"had the largest\r\naudiences, and gave the most pleasure; especially when she joined\r\ndelicate personal criticism or epigrammatic wit with high philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the School were always a delight to her; the papers\r\nwritten for it were among her most valuable essays; indeed, we may look\r\nupon them as the flowering of all her deep and painful toil in the\r\nfield of philosophy.[101]\r\n\r\n  [101] These essays were published in a volume entitled _Is Polite\r\n  Society Polite?_\r\n\r\nSeptember finds her planning an \"industrial circle\" in each State; a\r\nwoman's industrial convention hereafter; and attending a Suffrage\r\nConvention at Providence.\r\n\r\n\"Spoke of the divine right, not of kings or people, but of\r\nrighteousness. Spoke of Ouida's article in the 'North American Review.'\r\nIt had been reported that I declined to answer it. I said: 'You cannot\r\nmend a stocking which is _all_ holes. If you hold it up it will fall to\r\npieces of itself.'\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon spoke about the Marthas, male and female, who see only\r\nthe trouble and inconvenience of reform: of the Marys who rely upon\r\nprinciple.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this we have \"a day of dreadful hurry, preparing to go West and\r\nalso to shut up this house. Had to work _tight_ every minute....\"\r\n\r\nThis Western lecture trip was like many others, yet it had its own\r\npeculiar pleasures and mishaps.\r\n\r\n\"_October 12._ Dunkirk, lecture.... No one must know that I got off at\r\nthe wrong station--Perrysburg, a forlorn hamlet. No train that would\r\nbring me to Dunkirk before 6.30 P.M. Ought to have arrived at 1.30. Went\r\nto the 'hotel,' persuaded the landlord to lend his buggy and a kindly\r\nold fellow to harness his horses to it, and drove twenty miles or more\r\nover the mountains, reaching Dunkirk by 5.10 P.M. When the buggy was\r\nbrought to the door of the hotel, I said: 'How am I to get in?' 'Take\r\nit slow and learn to pedal,' said my old driver. Presently he said, 'I\r\nguess you ain't so old as I be.' I replied, 'I am pretty well on toward\r\nseventy.' 'Well, I am five years beyond,' said he. He drives an\r\naccommodation wagon between Perrysburg and Versailles, a small town\r\nwhere a man once wanted to set up a mill, and to buy land and water\r\npower, and they wouldn't sell either. Whereupon he went to Tonawanda and\r\nmade the place. 'Guess they'd have done better to gin him the land and\r\nwater, and to set up his mill for him,' said my man, Hinds.\"\r\n\r\nOn this trip she saw the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, taking the seven-mile\r\nwalk; went as far as Kansas City; was received everywhere with\r\ndelightful warmth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                                December 1, 1886.\r\n\r\nYou see, I was waiting for the winter to begin, in order to write you,\r\nand that you ought to have known. But bless you, in Gardiner, Maine, you\r\ndon't know when real _Winter_ begins, 'cause you have so much sham\r\nwinter. Well, better late than never. Here's thanking you very much for\r\nthe delightful [tea] cozy. Maud said, \"What are you going to do with\r\nit?\" sarcastic-like. I replied, \"Put it on my head\"; to which she\r\n_inquit_, \"Most natural thing for you to do.\" The sight of the monogram\r\ngave me real satisfaction and a sense of inborn dignity. You boil down\r\nto your monogram, after all, and this one was beyond my highest\r\nexpectations. I am only thinking, dear, whether you would not have\r\nshown more respect by putting the crimson satin bow on the monogram\r\nside, and thus, as it were, calling attention to the distinguished\r\ninitials.... I am grinding now in all of my mills, of which one is a\r\npaper for the \"Woman Suffrage Bazaar,\" which paper I am doing my best to\r\nedit. I cannot in conscience ask you to send me anything for its\r\ncolumns, because, poor dear, you have to do so much work on your own\r\naccount. At the same time, a trifling overflow into the hat would be\r\nvery welcome....\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter brought another grave anxiety. Florence in her turn developed\r\nrheumatic fever and became alarmingly ill. The mother-bird flew to her\r\nin terror. On the way she met Henry Ward Beecher and told him of her\r\ndeep distress, made still more poignant by the thought of the little\r\nchildren who might be left motherless. She was scarcely comforted by his\r\nassurance that he \"had known stepmothers who were very good to their\r\nstepchildren\"!\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas time, and she divided her time between the beloved\r\npatient and the children who must not lack their holiday cheer.\r\n\r\n\"_December 27._ The day was a very distressing one to me. I sat much of\r\nthe time beside Flossy with a strange feeling that I could keep her\r\nalive by some effort of my will. I seemed to contend with God, saying,\r\n'I gave up Julia, I can't give up Flossy--she has children.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 28._ Most of the day with dear Flossy, who seems a little\r\nbetter. I sat up with her until 1.30 A.M., and made a great effort of\r\nwill to put her to sleep. I succeeded--she slept well for more than an\r\nhour and slept again for a good while without any narcotic.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the illness she fought against the use of narcotics.\r\n\r\nThe cloud of danger and anxiety passed, and the year closed in happiness\r\nand deep thankfulness. The last entry reads:--\r\n\r\n\"God bless all my dear people, sisters, children, grandchildren, and\r\ncousins. God grant me also to serve while I live, and not to fail of the\r\nhigh and holy life. Amen!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                        Monday, January 31, 1887.\r\n\r\nNow, you just look here.\r\n\r\nDaughter began her school and music to-day. Nobody's a-neglecting of\r\nher. What you mean? Grandma took her to Clarke church, prouder than a\r\npeacock,--Grandma, I mean.\r\n\r\nCongregation _inquit_: \"Whose child is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Laura's,\" _responsa sum_.\r\n\r\n\"_Id cogitavi_\" was the general answer. And she's pop'lar, she is.\r\nLittle fourteen-year-olds keep a-coming and a-coming. And I draws her\r\nbath, and tucks her up in bed. And she's having a splendid time. And I\r\nwant some more of this paper. And my feelings won't allow me to say any\r\nmore. No--my dearest sweetest pug pie, your darling won't be forgotten\r\nfor a moment. We couldn't get at the lessons before, and last week,\r\nlike strong drink, was raging.\r\n\r\n                                 'Fectionate\r\n\r\n                                                              MA.\r\n\r\nMaud was now engaged to John Elliott, a young Scottish painter, whose\r\nacquaintance they had made in Europe in 1878. The marriage took place on\r\nFebruary 7, 1887. Though there were many periods of separation, the\r\nElliotts, when in this country, made their home for the most part with\r\nour mother. The affection between her and her son-in-law was deep; his\r\ndevotion to her constant. Through the years that were to follow, the\r\ncomradeship of the three was hardly less intimate than that of the two\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nThe Journal carries us swiftly onward. In place of the long meditations\r\non philosophy and metaphysics, we have brief notes of comings and\r\ngoings, of speaking and preaching, writing and reading. She works hard\r\nto finish her paper on \"Women in the Three Professions, Law, Medicine,\r\nand Theology,\" for the \"Chautauquan.\" \"Very tired afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nShe speaks at the Newport Opera House with Mrs. Livermore (who said she\r\ndid not know Mrs. Howe could speak so well); she takes part in the\r\nAuthors' Reading for the Longfellow Memorial in the Boston Museum,\r\nreciting \"Our Orders\" and the \"Battle Hymn,\" with her lines to\r\nLongfellow recently composed.\r\n\r\n\"I wore my velvet gown, my mother's lace, Uncle Sam's _Saint Esprit_,\r\nand did my best, as did all the others.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day she speaks at a suffrage meeting in Providence, and makes\r\nthis comment:--\r\n\r\n\"Woman suffrage represents individual right, integral humanity, ideal\r\njustice. I spoke of the attitude and action of Minerva in the\r\n'Eumenides';[102] her resistance to the Furies, who I said personified\r\npopular passion fortified by ancient tradition; her firm stand for a\r\njust trial, and her casting the decisive ballot. I hoped that this would\r\nprefigure a great life-drama in which this gracious prophecy would be\r\nrealized.\"\r\n\r\n  [102] Cf. Æschylus.\r\n\r\nIn a \"good talk with Miss Eddy,\"[103] she devises a correspondence and\r\ncircular to obtain information concerning art clubs throughout the\r\ncountry. \"I am to draft the circular.\"\r\n\r\n  [103] Miss Sarah J. Eddy, then of Providence, a granddaughter of Francis\r\n  Jackson.\r\n\r\nShe makes an address at the Unitarian Club in Providence.\r\n\r\n\"The keynote to this was given me yesterday, by the sight of the people\r\nwho thronged the popular churches, attracted, in a great measure no\r\ndoubt, by the Easter decoration and music. I thought: 'What a pity that\r\neverybody cannot hear Phillips Brooks.' I also thought: 'They can all\r\nhear the lesson of heavenly truth in the great Church of All Souls and\r\nof All Saints; _there_ is room enough and to spare.'\"\r\n\r\nShe writes a poem for the Blind Kindergarten at Jamaica Plain.\r\n\r\n\"I worked at my poem until the last moment and even changed it from the\r\nmanuscript as I recited it. The occasion was most interesting. Sam Eliot\r\npresided, and made a fine opening address, in which he spoke\r\nbeautifully of dear Julia and her service to the blind; also of her\r\nfather. I was joined by Drs. Peabody and Bartol, Brooke Herford and\r\nPhillips Brooks. They all spoke delightfully and were delightful to be\r\nwith. I recited my poem as well as I could. I think it was well liked,\r\nand I was glad of the work I bestowed on it.\"\r\n\r\nShe preaches at Parker Fraternity[104] on \"The Ignorant Classes.\"\r\n\r\n  [104] Boston.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that at the Club Tea she finds herself \"not over-bright.\"\r\nStill, she had a \"flash or two. The state of Karma [calmer], orchestral\r\nconversation, and solo speaking.\"\r\n\r\nShe hears the Reverend William Rounceville Alger's paper on the \"Blessed\r\nLife.\" \"Very spiritual and in a way edifying; but marred by what I\r\nshould call 'mixed metaphysic.' One goes beyond his paper to feel a deep\r\nsympathy with him, a man of intense intellectual impulse, in following\r\nwhich he undergoes a sort of martyrdom; while yet he does not seem to me\r\nto hit the plain, practical truth so much as one might wish. He is an\r\nestray between Western and Eastern thought, inclining a good deal,\r\nthough not exclusively, to the latter.\"\r\n\r\nShe goes to conferences of women preachers, to peace meetings; to\r\njubilee meetings, in honor of Queen Victoria; she conducts services at\r\nthe Home for Intemperate Women, and thinks it was a good time.\r\n\r\nShe \"bites into\" her paper on Aristophanes, \"with a very aching head\";\r\nfinishes it, delivers it at Concord before the School of Philosophy.\r\n\r\n\"Before I began, I sent this one word to Davidson,[105] _eleison_. This\r\nbecause it seemed as if he might resent my assuming to speak at all of\r\nthe great comedian. He seemed, however, to like what I said, and in the\r\ndiscussion which followed, he took part with me, against Sanborn, who\r\naccuses Aristophanes of having always lent his wit to the service of the\r\nold aristocratic party. Returned to Boston and took train for Weirs, New\r\nHampshire, where arrived more dead than alive.\"\r\n\r\n  [105] Thomas Davidson, founder of the \"New Fellowship\" (London and New\r\n  York) and of the \"Breadwinners' College.\"\r\n\r\nShe is at Newport now, and there are tender notes of pleasure with the\r\nHall grandchildren, of \"reading and prayers\" with them on Sunday, of\r\npicnics and sailing parties.\r\n\r\nStill, in dreams, she calls back the lost daughter; still records with\r\nanxious care each visionary word and gesture.\r\n\r\n\"Dreamed this morning of Charles Sumner and dearest Julia. She was\r\ntalking to me; part of the time reclining on a sort of lounge. I said to\r\nsome one, 'This is our own dear Julia, feel how warm she is.'... I think\r\nI said something about our wanting to see her oftener. She said\r\npathetically, 'Can't you talk of me?' I said, 'We do, darling.' 'Not\r\nvery often,' I think was her reply. Then she seemed to come very near\r\nme, and I said to her, 'Darling, do they let you come here as often as\r\nyou want to?' She said, 'Not quite.' I asked why, and she answered\r\nalmost inaudibly, 'They are afraid of my troubling people.' I stirred\r\nand woke; but the dear vision remains with me, almost calling me across\r\nthe silent sea.\"\r\n\r\nShe writes innumerable letters; date and address of each is carefully\r\nnoted, and now and then an abstract of her words.\r\n\r\n\"The bane of all representative action is that the spur of personal\r\nambition will carry people further than larger and more generous\r\nconsiderations of good are apt to do. So the mean-hearted and ambitious\r\nare always forward in politics; while those who believe in great\r\nprinciples are perhaps too much inclined to let the principles do all\r\nthe work....\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts hurry the year to its close:--\r\n\r\n\"_November 7._ Left for Boston by 10.20 A.M. train, to attend the\r\ncelebration of Michael's [Anagnos] fiftieth birthday at the Institution,\r\nand the opening meeting of the N.E.W.C.... Arriving in Boston, I ran\r\nabout somewhat, fatiguing myself dreadfully. Reached the Institution by\r\n4.30 P.M., when, throwing myself on the bed for necessary rest, the\r\ndesired rhymes for Anagnos's birthday flashed upon me, 'all of a\r\nsudden,' and instead of napping, I called for pen and ink and wrote\r\nthem. The meeting was very good; I presided. Dwight and Rodocanachi made\r\nspeeches, the latter presenting the beautiful chain given to Michael by\r\nthe teachers of the Institution. Michael was much moved and could not\r\nbut be much gratified. I proposed three cheers at the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"I stole half an hour to attend a meeting in memory of Hannah\r\nStephenson [the friend and house-mate of Theodore Parker] of whom much\r\ngood was said that I did not know of. I reproached myself for having\r\nalways been repelled by her ugliness of countenance and tart manner, and\r\nhaving thus failed to come within the sphere of her really noble\r\ninfluence. The occasion recalled a whole vision of the early and painful\r\nstruggle in Boston; of the martyrdom of feeling endured by friends of\r\nthe slave--of Parker's heroic house and pulpit. It seemed, as it often\r\ndoes, great to have known these things, little to have done so little in\r\nconsequence.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 27._ Finished my lecture on 'Woman in the Greek Drama.' It\r\nwas high time, as my head and eyes are tired with the persistent\r\nstrain.... All the past week has been hard work. No pleasure reading\r\nexcept a very little in the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 1...._ Took 2.30 train for Melrose.... I read my new\r\nlecture--'Woman as shown by the Greek Dramatists': of whom I quoted from\r\nÆschylus, Sophocles, and Aristophanes. A Club Tea followed: a pleasant\r\none. I asked the mothers present whether they educated their daughters\r\nin hygiene and housekeeping. The response was not enthusiastic, and\r\npeople were more disposed to talk of the outer world, careers of women,\r\nbusiness or profession, than to speak of the home business. One young\r\ngirl, however, told us that she was a housekeeping girl; a very pleasant\r\nlady, Mrs. Burr, had been trained by her mother, to her own great\r\nadvantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 18._ For the [Parker] Fraternity a text occurs to me, 'Upon\r\nthis rock I will build my church.' Will speak of the simple religious\r\nelement in human nature, the loss of which no critical skill or insight\r\ncould replace. Will quote some of the acts and expressions of the true\r\nreligious zeal of other days, and ask why this means nothing for us of\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\nHer first act of 1888 was to preach this sermon before the Parker\r\nFraternity. It was one of those best liked by herself and others.\r\n\r\nThe great event of this year was her visit to California. She had never\r\nseen the Pacific Coast; the Elliotts were going to Chicago for an\r\nindefinite stay; her sister Annie, whom she had not seen in many years,\r\nbegged earnestly for a visit from the \"Old Bird.\"\r\n\r\nShe decided to make the journey, and arranged a lecture tour to cover\r\nits expenses.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was throughout one of deepest interest. It began with \"a\r\nday of frightful hurry and fatigue. I had been preparing for this\r\ndeparture for some time past; yet when the time came, it seemed as if I\r\ncould hardly get off. Maud worked hard to help me. She insisted upon\r\narranging matters for me; went to the bank; got my ticket. We parted\r\ncheerfully, yet I felt the wrench. God knows whether she will ever be in\r\nmy house again, as my partner in care and responsibility....\"\r\n\r\nAfter an \"A.A.W.\" conference in Boston, and a Woman's Council in\r\nWashington, she took the road. Her first stop was at Chicago. Here she\r\nwas \"very busy and not quite well. Divided the day between Maud and some\r\nnecessary business. At 3.15 P.M. the dreadful wrench took place. Maud\r\nwas very brave, but I know that she felt it as I did....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  _To Maud_\r\n\r\n                                          MERCHANTS' HOTEL,\r\n                                   ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, April 10.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good, my dear sweet child. I got me off as well as possible,\r\nthough we had many complications and delays as to the ticket. My section\r\nwas very comfortable. I had supper in the dining-car, and slept well, no\r\ntheatre-troupe nor D. T. being aboard. I have now got my ticket all\r\nstraight to 'Frisco, and won't I frisk oh! when I get there!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next stop was at Spokane Falls. Here she had \"a bronchial attack;\r\nvery hoarse and sore in my throat and chest. Went over my lecture\r\ncarefully, leaving out some pages. Felt absolute need of tea-stimulant,\r\nand went downtown, finding some in a grocer's shop. The good servant\r\nDora made me a hot cup which refreshed me greatly. Very hoarse at my\r\nlecture. Opera House a good one enough; for a desk, a box mounted on a\r\nbarrel, all covered with a colored paper; decent enough. Lecture:\r\n'Polite Society'; well received.\" The Spokane of to-day may smile at the\r\nsmall things of yesterday; yet our mother always spoke with pleasure of\r\nher cordial reception there.\r\n\r\nWalla Walla, Walula, Paser. In the last-named place she \"found a tavern\r\nwith many claimants for beds. Mrs. Isaacs, who came with me from Walla\r\nWalla for a little change of air, could not have a separate room, and\r\nwe were glad to share not only a small room but also a three-quarters\r\nbed. I was cramped and slept miserably. She was very quiet and amiable.\"\r\n\r\nAt Tacoma again (on the way whither she felt as if her life hung by a\r\nthread while crossing the Notch), there was but one room for the two\r\nladies, but they occupied it \"very peacefully.\"\r\n\r\nAfter church at Tacoma \"we heard singing in one of the parlors, and went\r\nin quest of it. In the great parlor of the hotel where hops take place,\r\nwe found an assemblage of men and women, mostly young, singing Gospel\r\nhymns, with an accompaniment of grand piano. The Bishop of New Zealand\r\nstood in the middle of the apartment singing with gusto. Presently he\r\ntook his place at the instrument, his wife joining him as if she thought\r\nhis situation dangerous for a 'lone hand.' A little later, some one, who\r\nappeared to act as master of ceremonies, asked me to come over and be\r\nintroduced to the Bishop, to which I consented. His first question was:\r\n'Are you going to New Zealand immediately?' He is a Londoner. 'Ah, come;\r\nwith all your States, you can show nothing like London.' Being asked for\r\na brief address, he spoke very readily, with a frank, honest face, and\r\nin a genial, offhand manner. A good specimen of his sort, not\r\nfine-brained, nor over-brained, but believing in religion and glad to\r\ndevote his life to it. The Bishop has blue eyes and a shaggy head of\r\ngrizzled hair.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Tacoma came \"hospitable Seattle\"; where she lectured and attended\r\na meeting of the Seattle Emerson Club; then to Olympia, by a small Sound\r\nsteamer.\r\n\r\n\"A queer old bachelor on board, hearing me say that I should like to\r\nlive in Washington Territory, said he would give me a handsome house and\r\nlot if I would live in Olympia, at which several Olympians present\r\nlaughed.\"\r\n\r\nShe left Olympia by train, _en route_ for Portland. The conductor,\r\n\"Brown by name,\" saw the name on her valise, and claimed acquaintance,\r\nremembering her when she lived in Boylston Place. Soon after, passing a\r\nlovely little mill-stream, with a few houses near it, by name Tumwater,\r\nshe consulted him as to the value of land there, with the result that\r\nshe bought several acres of \"good bottom land.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of several small purchases of land made during her various\r\njourneyings. She always hoped that they would bring about large results:\r\nthe Tumwater property was specially valued by her, though she never set\r\nfoot in the place. The pioneer was strong in her, as it was in the\r\nDoctor; the romance of travel never failed to thrill her. Speeding\r\nhither and thither by rail, her eye caught beauty and desirableness in a\r\nflash; the settler stirred in her blood, and she longed to possess and\r\nto develop. Tumwater she fondly hoped was to bring wealth to the two\r\neldest grandchildren, to whom she bequeathed it.\r\n\r\nIn Portland she spent several days, lectured three times, and was most\r\nhospitably entertained. On her one disengaged evening she went down into\r\nthe hotel parlor, played for the guests to dance, played accompaniments\r\nfor them to sing. She spoke to the school children; \"she made slight\r\nacquaintance with various people,\" most of whom told her the story of\r\ntheir lives. Briefly, she touched life at every point.\r\n\r\nFinally, on May 5, she reached San Francisco, and a few hours later the\r\nranch of San Geronimo, where the Mailliards had been living for some\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"Situation very beautiful,\" she says; \"a cup in the mountains.\" Here she\r\nfound her beloved sister Annie, the \"little Hitter\" of her early\r\nletters; here she spent happy days, warm with outer and inner sunshine.\r\n\r\nCalifornia was a-tiptoe with eagerness to see and hear the author of the\r\n\"Battle Hymn\"; many lectures were planned, in San Francisco and\r\nelsewhere. The Journal gives but brief glimpses of this California\r\nvisit, which she always recalled with delight as one of the best of all\r\nher \"great good times.\" In the newspaper clippings, preserved in a\r\nscrapbook, we find the adjectives piled mountain high in praise and\r\nappreciation. Though not yet seventy, she was already, in the eye of the\r\nyouthful reporter, \"aged\"; her silver hair was dwelt on lovingly; people\r\nwere amazed at her activity. One of the great occasions was the\r\ncelebration of Decoration Day by the Grand Army of the Republic in the\r\nGrand Opera House, at which she was the guest of honor. The house was\r\npacked; the stage brilliant with flowers and emblems. Her name was\r\ncheered to the echo. She spoke a few words of acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\"I join in this celebration with thrilled and uplifted heart. I remember\r\nthose camp-fires, I remember those dreadful battles. It was a question\r\nwith us women, 'Will our men prevail? Until they do they will not come\r\nhome.' How we blessed them when they did; how we blessed them with our\r\nprayers when they were in the battlefield. Those were times of sorrow;\r\nthis is one of joy. Let us thank God, who has given us these victories.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience rose _en masse_, and stood while the \"Battle Hymn\" was\r\nsung, author and audience joining in the chorus.\r\n\r\nAfter her second lecture in Santa Barbara, she \"sauntered a little, and\r\nspent a little money. Bought some imperfect pearls which will look well\r\nwhen set. Wanted a handsome brooch which I saw; thought I had best\r\nconquer my desire, and did so.\"\r\n\r\nAt Ventura: \"Got so tired that I could hardly dress for lecture.\" The\r\nnext day she proposed to Mrs. S. at dinner (1 P.M.) to invite some young\r\npeople for the evening, promising to play for them to dance. \"She [Mrs.\r\nS.] ordered a buggy and drove about the village. Her son stretched a\r\nburlap on the straw matting and waxed it. About thirty came. We had some\r\nsweet music, singers with good voices, and among others a pupil of\r\nPerabo, who was really interesting and remarkable.\"\r\n\r\nAt one of the hospitable cities, a gentleman asked her to drive with\r\nhim, drove her about for a couple of hours, descanting upon the beauties\r\nof the place, and afterwards proclaimed that Mrs. Howe was the most\r\nagreeable woman he had ever met. \"And I never once opened my lips!\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nOn June 10 she preached in Oakland: \"the one sermon which I have felt\r\nlike preaching in these parts: 'Thou art Peter, and upon this rock.' The\r\nhouse was well filled.... After service as I leaned over to speak to\r\nthose who stopped to greet me, I saw one of our old church-members, who\r\ntold me, with eyes full of tears, that our dear James Freeman Clarke is\r\nno more. This was like an ice-bolt; I could not realize it at first.\r\n\r\n  \"'A very tender history\r\n  Did in your passing fall.'\r\n\r\n\"Years of sweet converse, of following and dependence, end with this\r\nevent.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo we come to the last day at the ranch, the parting with the dear\r\nsister; the departure for San Francisco, laden with roses and good\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nOn the way eastward she stopped at Salt Lake City, and went to the\r\nMormon Tabernacle; \"an enormous building with a roof like the back of a\r\nturtle; many tourists present. The Mormons mostly an ill-looking and\r\nill-smelling crowd. Bishop Whitney, a young man, preached a cosmopolite\r\nsermon, quoting Milton and Emerson. He spoke of the Christian Church\r\nwith patronizing indulgence; insisted upon the doctrine of immediate and\r\npersonal revelation, and censured the Mormons for sometimes considering\r\ntheir families before their church. Communion, bread in silver baskets\r\nand water in silver cups, handed to every one, children partaking with\r\nthe rest; no solemnity.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 26._ To visit the penitentiary, where thirty Mormon bishops are\r\nimprisoned for polygamy. Spoke with one, Bishop of Provo, a rather\r\ncanny-looking man, whom we found in the prison library, reading. The\r\nlibrarian (four years' term for forgery) told me it was the result of\r\nliquor and bad company. I said a few motherly words to him and presently\r\nproposed to speak to the prisoners, to which the jailer gladly assented.\r\nI began by saying, 'I feel to speak to you, my brothers.' Said that all\r\nof us make mistakes and many of us do wrong at times. Exhorted them to\r\ngive, in future, obedience to the laws upon which the existence of\r\nsociety depends. The convict Montrose sent to me a little chain and\r\nornaments of his own making. I promised to send one or two books for the\r\nlibrary....\"\r\n\r\nSo, through \"bowery and breezy Nebraska; such a relief to eyes and\r\nnerves!\" to Chicago, where Maud kept and comforted her as long as might\r\nbe, and sent her refreshed on her way; finally to Boston, where she\r\narrived half-starved, and so to Newport.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To Maud_\r\n\r\n                                                    July 8, 1888.\r\n\r\n  Grumble, grumble--tumble, tumble,\r\n  For something to eat,\r\n  Fast-y fast-y nasty, nasty,\r\n  At last, at last-y,\r\n  Ma's dead beat!\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the dust of it, and the swirl, in which the black porter and the\r\nwhite babies all seemed mixed up together. A few dried and withered old\r\nwomen, like myself, were thrown in, an occasional smoky gent, and the\r\ngruel 'thick and slab,' was what is called Human Nature! This is the\r\nspleeny vein, and I indulge it to make you laugh, but really, my journey\r\nwas as comfortable as heat and speed would allow. Imagine my feelings on\r\nlearning that there was no dining or buffet car! Do not grieve about\r\nthis, the biscuits and bananas which you put up carried me quite a way.\r\nWe got a tolerable breakfast at Cleveland, and a bad dinner at Buffalo,\r\nbut dry your eyes, the strawberry shortcake was uncommonly good. And\r\nthink how good it is that I have got through with it all and can now\r\nrest good and handsome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer entries in the Journal are varied and picturesque. \"My cow,\r\nof which I was fond, was found dead this morning.... My neighbor Almy\r\nwas very kind.... I feel this a good deal, but complaining will not help\r\nmatters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bancroft [George], historian, brought Dr. Hedge to call after\r\ndinner. Mr. B. kissed me on both cheeks for the first time in his life.\r\nWe had a very pleasant and rather brilliant talk, as might have been\r\nexpected where such men meet.\"\r\n\r\nShe writes to Maud:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Alger seized upon my left ear metaphorically and emptied into it\r\nall the five-syllable words that he knew, and the result was a mingling\r\nof active and passive lunacy, for I almost went mad and he had not far\r\nto go in that direction.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again; apropos of ----: \"How the great world does use up a man! It\r\nis not merely the growing older, for that is a natural and simple\r\nprocess; but it is the coating of worldliness which seems to varnish\r\nthe life out of a man; dead eyes, dead smile, and (worst of all) dead\r\nbreath.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 23_. To church in Newport. A suggestive sermon from Mr.\r\nAlger on 'Watching,' _i.e._, upon all the agencies that watch us,\r\nchildren, foes, friends, critics, authorities, spirits, God himself.\r\n\r\n\"As we drove into town [Newport] I had one of those momentary glimpses\r\nwhich in things spiritual are so infinitely precious. The idea became\r\nclear and present to my mind that God, an actual presence, takes note of\r\nour actions and intentions. I thought how helpful it would be to us to\r\npass our lives in a sense of this divine supervision. After this inward\r\nexperience I was almost startled by the theme of Alger's sermon. I spoke\r\nto him of the coincidence, and he said it must have been a thought wave.\r\nThe thought is one to which I have need to cling. I have at this moment\r\nmental troubles, obsessions of imagination, from which I pray to be\r\ndelivered. While this idea of the divine presence was clear to me, I\r\nfelt myself lifted above these things. May this lifting continue.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 4._ In my prayer this morning I thanked God that I have come\r\nto grieve more over my moral disappointments than over my intellectual\r\nones. With my natural talents I had nothing to do: with my use or abuse\r\nof them, everything.\r\n\r\n\"I have thought, too, lately, of a reason why we should not neglect our\r\nduty to others for our real or supposed duty to ourselves. It is this:\r\nourselves we have always with us; our fellows flit from our company, or\r\npass away and we must help them when and while we can.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 5 she hears \"the bitter news of Abby May's death. Alas! and\r\nalas! for the community, for her many friends, and for the Club and the\r\nCongress in which she did such great silent service. God rest her in His\r\nsweet peace!\"\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day she went to \"Trinity Church, where I enjoyed Phillips\r\nBrooks's sermon. Felt much drawn to go to communion with the rest; but\r\nthought it might occasion surprise and annoyance. Going into a remote\r\nupper gallery I was present at the scene, and felt that I had my\r\ncommunion without partaking of the 'elements.' These lines also\r\nsuggested themselves as I walked home:--\r\n\r\n  \"The Universal bread,\r\n  The sacrificial wine,\r\n  The glory of the thorn-crowned head,\r\n  Humanity divine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The last day of the year dawned upon me, bringing solemn thoughts of\r\nthe uncertainty of life, and sorrow for such misuse of its great gifts\r\nand opportunities as I am well conscious of. This has been a good year\r\nto me. It carried me to the Pacific slope, and showed me indeed a land\r\nof promise. It gave me an unexpected joy in the harmonious feelings\r\ntoward me and the members of A.A.W. at the Detroit Congress. It has,\r\nalas! taken from me my dear pastor, most precious to me for help and\r\ninstruction, and other dear and valued friends, notably Sarah Shaw\r\nRussell,[106] Abby W. May and Carrie Tappan.[107] I desire to set my\r\nhouse in order, and be ready for my departure; thankful to live, or\r\nwilling to cease from my mortal life when God so wills....\"\r\n\r\n  [106] Mrs. George Russell, widow of the Doctor's friend and college\r\n  chum.\r\n\r\n  [107] Caroline Tappan was Caroline Sturgis, daughter of Captain William\r\n  Sturgis, and sister of Ellen (Sturgis) Hooper,--member of the inmost\r\n  Transcendentalist circle, and friend of Emerson, Ellery Channing, and\r\n  Margaret Fuller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSEVENTY YEARS YOUNG\r\n\r\n1889-1890; _aet._ 70-71\r\n\r\n  The seven decades of my years\r\n  I figure like those Pleiad spheres\r\n  Which, thro' the heaven's soft impulse moved,\r\n  Still seek a sister star beloved.\r\n\r\n  Thro' many sorrows, more delight,\r\n  Thro' miracles in sound and sight,\r\n  Thro' battles lost and battles won,\r\n  These star-spaced years have led me on.\r\n\r\n  Though long behind me shows the path,\r\n  The future still its promise hath,\r\n  For tho' the past be fair and fond,\r\n  The perfect number lies beyond.\r\n\r\n                                     J. W. H.\r\n\r\nShe was dissatisfied with herself in these days.\r\n\r\n\"_January 1, 1889._ In my prayer this night I asked for weight and\r\nearnestness of purpose. I am too frivolous and frisky.\"\r\n\r\n\"On waking I said, 'If God does not help me this day, I shall not be\r\nable to finish my address' [for a Washington's Birthday celebration at\r\nNewport].\"\r\n\r\nShe thinks He did help her, as she found the vein of what she wished to\r\nsay, and finished it to her \"tolerable satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I entered the hall in the evening, the thought of Cinderella struck\r\nme, and I used it by comparing the fashion, of which we make so much\r\naccount, to Cinderella with her rat horses and pumpkin carriage, so\r\nresplendent until her hour came; then the horses would not carry her,\r\nthe golden coach would not hold her, her illusory grandeur was at an\r\nend. Our cause of truth and justice I compared to the Princess in her\r\nenchanted sleep, who lies spellbound until the true champion comes to\r\nrescue her, and the two go forth together, to return to sleep and\r\ndiversion, oh, never more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the note throughout the Journal; the record of work, the prayer\r\nfor strength. Yet the friskiness was there; no one but herself would\r\nhave had less of it.\r\n\r\nShe had already entered the happy estate of grandmotherhood, and enjoyed\r\nit to the full. New songs must be made for the little new people, new\r\ngames invented. We see her taking a grandchild's hands in hers, and\r\nimprovising thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"We have two hands,\r\n  To buckle bands!\r\n  We have ten fingers,\r\n  To make clotheswringers!\r\n  We have two thumbs,\r\n  To pick up crumbs!\r\n  We have two heels,\r\n  To bob for eels!\r\n  We have ten toes,\r\n  To match our nose!\"\r\n\r\nIf the child be tired or fretful, \"Hush!\" says the grandmother. \"Be\r\ngood, and I will play you the 'Canarybird's Funeral.'\" Off they go to\r\nthe piano, and the \"Canarybird's Funeral\" is improvised, and must be\r\nplayed over and over, for this and succeeding grandchildren. For them,\r\ntoo, she composed the musical drama of \"Flibbertigibbet,\" which she was\r\nto play and recite for so many happy children, and grown folks too.\r\nFlibbertigibbet was a black imp who appeared one day in the\r\nmarket-place, and playing a jig on his fiddle, set all the people\r\ndancing whether they would or no. She played the jig, and one did not\r\nwonder at the people. Next came Flibbertigibbet's march, which he played\r\non his way to prison; his melancholy, as he sat in durance; the cats on\r\nthe roof of his prison; finally, entrance of the benevolent fairy, who\r\nwhisks him off in a balloon to fairyland. All these, voice and piano\r\ngave together: nobody who heard \"Flibbertigibbet\" ever forgot it. She\r\nset Mother Goose to music for the grandchildren; singing of Little Boy\r\nBlue, and the Man in the Moon. She thought these nursery melodies among\r\nher best compositions; from time to time, however, other and graver airs\r\ncame to her, dreamed over the piano on summer evenings, or in twilight\r\nwalks among the Newport meadows. Some of these airs were gathered and\r\npublished in later years.[108]\r\n\r\n  [108] _Song Album._ Published by G. Schirmer & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May of this year she notes the closing of a life long associated with\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\"_May 24._ Laura Bridgman died to-day at about 12 M. This event brings\r\nwith it solemn suggestions, which my overcrowded brain cannot adequately\r\nfollow. Her training was a beautiful out-blossoming from the romance of\r\nmy husband's philanthropy. She has taught a great lesson in her time,\r\nand unfortunates of her sort are now trained, without question of the\r\nresult. This was to S. G. H. an undiscovered country in the first\r\ninstance. I cannot help imagining him as standing before the face of\r\nthe Highest and pointing to his work: happy, thrice happy man, with all\r\nhis sorrow!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe close of her seventieth year was a notable milestone on the long\r\nroad. May found her still carrying full sail; a little more tired after\r\neach exertion, a little puzzled at the occasional rebellion of \"Sister\r\nBody,\" her hard-worked \"A.B.,\"; but not yet dreaming of taking in a\r\nreef.\r\n\r\nThe seventieth birthday was a great festival. Maud, inviting Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes to the party, had written, \"Mamma will be _seventy years\r\nyoung_ on the 27th. Come and play with her!\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor in his reply said, \"It is better to be seventy years young\r\nthan forty years old!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes himself was now eighty years old. It was in these days that\r\nshe went with Laura to call on him, and found him in his library, a big,\r\nbright room, looking out on the Charles River, books lining the walls, a\r\nprevailing impression of atlases and dictionaries open on stands. The\r\ngreeting between the two was pleasant to see, their talk something to\r\nremember. \"Ah, Mrs. Howe,\" said the Autocrat, \"you at seventy have much\r\nto learn about life. At eighty you will find new vistas opening in every\r\ndirection!\"\r\n\r\nTen years later she was reminded of this. \"It is true!\" she said.\r\n\r\nAt parting he kissed her, which touched her deeply.\r\n\r\nHe was in another mood when they met at a reception shortly after this.\r\n\"Ah! Mrs. Howe,\" he said, \"you see I still hang on as one of the old\r\nwrecks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are indeed _Rex_!\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then, Madam,\" he cried with a flash, \"you are _Regina_!\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the birthday! Here are a few of the letters received:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _From George William Curtis_\r\n\r\n                          WEST NEW BRIGHTON, STATEN ISLAND, N.Y.,\r\n\r\n                                        May 9, 1889.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. ELLIOTT,--\r\n\r\nI shall still be too lame to venture so far away from home as your kind\r\ninvitation tempts me to stray, but no words of my regard and admiration\r\nfor Mrs. Howe will ever limp and linger. I doubt if among the hosts who\r\nwill offer their homage upon her accession to the years of a ripe youth\r\nthere will be many earlier friends than I, and certainly there will be\r\nnone who have watched her career with more sympathy in her varied and\r\nhumane activities. Poet, scholar, philanthropist, and advocate of true\r\nDemocracy, her crown is more than triple, and it is her praise as it may\r\nwell be her pride to have added fresh lustre to the married name she\r\nbears.\r\n\r\nI am sincerely sorry that only in this inadequate way can I join my\r\nvoice to the chorus of friendly rejoicing and congratulation on the\r\nhappy day, which reminds us only of the perpetual youth of the warm\r\nheart and the sound mind.\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly yours,\r\n                                           GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _From W.

Though years have gone by since I have seen you,\r\nyou are still fresh, joyous, and amusing, and charming as ever. Of this\r\nI am fully persuaded, and often I look into that anxious mirror of my\r\nmind, and see you and wander with you, and jest with you and sing with\r\nyou, as I used in the olden days; and never will I be so faithless as to\r\nbelieve that you are any older than you were--and I hope earnestly you\r\nare no wiser and that a great deal of folly is still left in you--as it\r\nis, I am happy to say, in me.\r\n\r\nFor, after all, what is life worth when its folly is all departed? When\r\nwe have grown wise and sad as well as old--it is time to say Good-bye.\r\nBut that time has not come for us yet. So let us still shout _Evviva_!\r\n\r\nI do not mention the fact of your age,--I don't know it,--but if I\r\nshould guess, from what I know I should say twenty-five. I was\r\ntwenty-eight when I left America--and that is such a few months ago--and\r\nI know you were born somewhat about the same time.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a great many congratulations and expressions of\r\nfriendship, but none more sincere than those of\r\n\r\n                                 Your old friend--I mean\r\n                                       Your young friend,\r\n                                                     W.

You say, \"if there be no obstacle.\" No less\r\nthan a couple of thousand miles of water, harder to get over than the\r\nyears themselves, which indeed get behind more swiftly than they ought.\r\nI can at least wish you many happy returns of the day and will drink to\r\nyour health on the 27th.

A very busy day for all of us.... My head was\r\ndressed at eleven. All my children were here, with daughter- and\r\nsons-in-law. I had many lovely gifts. The house was like a garden of\r\ncostly flowers. Breakfast was at 12.30; was in very good style. Guests:\r\nGeneral Walker, John S. Dwight, E. E. Hale, Mrs. Jack Gardner, Mmes.\r\nBell, Pratt, and Agassiz. Walker made the first speech at the table, H.\r\nM. H.[109] being toastmaster. Walker seemed to speak very feelingly,\r\ncalling me the first citizeness of the country; stood silent a little\r\nand sat down. Dwight read a delightful poem; Hale left too soon to do\r\nanything. H. introduced J. S. D. thus: 'Sweetness and light, your name\r\nis Dwight.' While we sat at table, baskets and bouquets of wonderful\r\nflowers kept constantly arriving; the sweet granddaughters brought them\r\nin, in a sort of procession lovely to see. It rained in the afternoon,\r\nbut the house was thronged with visitors, all the same.\"\r\n\r\n  [109] Henry Marion Howe.\r\n\r\nA sober entry, written the next day, when she was \"very tired, with a\r\ndelightful fatigue\": but on the day itself she was gay, enjoying her\r\n\"party\" to the full, treasuring every flower, wondering why people were\r\nso good to her.\r\n\r\nThe festivities lasted several days, for every one wanted to \"play\r\nBirthday\" with her. The New England Woman's Club gave her a luncheon,\r\nwhich she valued next to the home celebration; the blind children of the\r\nPerkins Institution must hear her speak, and in return sing some of her\r\nsongs, and give her flowers, clustering round her with tender, groping\r\nfingers that sought to clasp hers. Moreover, the last week of May is\r\nAnniversary Week in Boston. Suffragists, women ministers, Unitarians,\r\n\"uplifters\" of every description, held their meetings (traditionally in\r\na pouring rain) and one and all wanted Mrs. Howe.\r\n\r\n\"I have said to God on every morning of these busy days: 'Give me this\r\nday,' and He has given them all: _i.e._, He has given me power to fulfil\r\nthe task appointed for each.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she finally got to Newport, she was \"dazed with the quiet after the\r\nstrain of heart and fatigue.\"\r\n\r\nThe ministry was much in her mind this summer.\r\n\r\n\"I take for my guidance a new motto: 'I will ascend'; not in my\r\nambition, but in my thoughts and aims.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dry Sunday, _i.e._, no church, it being the women's turn to go. I\r\nshelled peas for dinner. Began Rambaud's 'History of Russia.'... I think\r\nof two sermons to write, one, 'A spirit of Power'; one, 'Behold, I show\r\nyou a more excellent way.'\"\r\n\r\nSuffrage had its meed too in these summer days.\r\n\r\n\"Have copied my Call for the Congress. In my coming suffrage talks will\r\ninvite women to study the history of their sex in the past, and its\r\ndestiny in the future; inertia and ignorance are the great dangers of\r\nsociety. The old condition of women largely increased instead of\r\ndiminishing these sources of evil. The women were purposely kept\r\nignorant, in order that they might be enslaved and degraded. Inertia is\r\nlargely fostered by the paralysis of independent action....\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel just now that we ought to try hard to have all the Far West\r\nrepresented at the Denver Congress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought a book or article about 'Fooleries' would be entertaining and\r\ninstructive. The need of this element in human society is shown by the\r\nancient jesters and court fools.... In Bible times Samson made sport for\r\nthe Philistines. People now do their own dancing and their own fooling:\r\nsome of it very dull. Query: What ancient jests have been preserved?\r\n'The Fools of old and of all time' would not be a bad title.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn October came the Woman's Congress in Denver; she was there,\r\n\"attending all meetings and sessions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. ----'s paper on 'The Redemptive Power of Art' was very so-so, and\r\ndid not touch my conception of the theme, viz., art made valuable for\r\nthe reform of criminals. I spoke of this with warmth.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Congress \"the visiting ladies enjoyed a drive about the city\r\nof Denver. I went early to the High School with A. A. B.[110] Found Mrs.\r\nCheney speaking to the pupils assembled. She did not notice our entrance\r\nand spoke of me very warmly. Presently, turning round, she saw us and we\r\nall laughed. I spoke to them of my 'drink of youth'; compared the\r\nspirits of youth to steam given to carry them on a celestial railroad;\r\ncompared youth to wine in a beautiful vase; spoke of ancient libations\r\nto the gods; our libation to be poured to the true Divine; urged them\r\nnot to starve their studies in order to feed their amusements. 'Two ways\r\nof study, one mean, the other generous.' Told them not to imitate\r\nsavages, who will barter valuable land for worthless baubles; not so to\r\nbarter their opportunities for barren pleasures.\"\r\n\r\n  [110] The Reverend Antoinette Blackwell.\r\n\r\nShe preached at Unity Church Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n\"At Grace Church [Methodist] in the afternoon. Spoke to the text, 'God\r\nhath not left himself without a witness.' This witness is in every human\r\nheart; which, with all its intense desires, desires most of all, law,\r\norder, religion.... I applied my text to the coming out into the new\r\nterritories; a rough Exodus stimulated by the love of gold; but with the\r\narmy of fortune-seekers go faithful souls, and instead of passing out of\r\ncivilization, they extend its bounds. 'Praise waiteth for thee in\r\nZion'--yes, but the Prophet says: 'The solitary places shall be glad for\r\nthem,' et cetera. I set this down for future use.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Denver people were most friendly, and she enjoyed the visit greatly.\r\nThence she stepped westward once more, lecturing and preaching as she\r\nwent, everywhere welcomed with cordial warmth, everywhere carrying her\r\nministry with her.\r\n\r\n\"A sweet young mother was dreadfully plagued with two babies; I helped\r\nher as much as I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"A delicate young woman was travelling with her father, a boy of five\r\nyears, and a semi-friend, semi-help, not much of either. This party sat\r\nopposite me in the Pullman, and soon made acquaintance. She is going for\r\nher health from Tacoma to California. An odd-looking genius, something\r\nlike ---- in his youth, got in somewhere and attracted my attention by\r\nhis restless manner. I took him for no good; a gambler, perhaps. He\r\nseemed to notice me a good deal....\r\n\r\n\"Made acquaintance with the odd-looking young man. He is a timber-land\r\nbroker. He had noticed me because I reminded him of his mother. We\r\nbecame friends. He told me his story. He brought another gentleman, a\r\nman more of society than himself, and we and Mrs. Campbell played whist.\r\nWe were quite gay all day. In the evening a sad, elderly man whom I had\r\nobserved, came over and showed me his wife's photograph as she had\r\nlooked in health, and then a photograph of her in her last illness; he\r\nholding her up in his arms. He said he was travelling to help his\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\n\"At Reading my two whist gentlemen cried out, '_Tamales!_' and rushed\r\nout. They presently returned, bringing some curious Mexican eatables,\r\ncorn meal with chicken and red peppers rolled in corn leaves. These folk\r\nall left at Sacramento at three in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia was once more her goal. This second visit was brief and\r\nhurried.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry, scurry to dress for the Forefathers' Day celebration. Oakley was\r\nmy squire. I was taken down to dinner by Professor Moore, President of\r\nthe occasion.... I was suddenly and unexpectedly called for, and all\r\nwere requested to rise, which was a great honor done me. I spoke of two\r\nCongregationalists whom I had known, Antoinette Blackwell, of whose\r\nordination I told; then of Theodore Parker, of whom I said, 'Nothing\r\nthat I have heard here is more Christian than what I heard from him.' I\r\ntold of his first having brought into notice the hymn, 'Nearer, My God,\r\nto Thee,' and said that I had sung it with him; said that in advising\r\nwith all women's clubs, I always urged them to include in their\r\nprogrammes pressing questions of the day. Was much applauded....

She had made acquaintance with the people who had the\r\ntwo sections behind mine. I had observed a gaunt young man going back\r\nand forth, with a look on his face which made me say to my friend in\r\nNumber Nine: \"That man must have committed a murder.\" Who do you think\r\nhe turned out to be? Lieutenant Ripley, of the Vandalia, U.S.N., the\r\ngreat ship which went to pieces on the Samoan reef. I, of course,\r\ndetermined to hear about it from his own lips, and we had a most\r\ninteresting talk. He is very slight, but must be all nerve and muscle.\r\nAll the sailors in the top in which he was clinging for his life fell\r\noff and were drowned. He held on till the Trenton came down upon them,\r\nwhen, with the others who were saved in other parts of the rigging, he\r\ncrept along a hawser and somehow reached the Trenton. Fearing that she\r\nwould go to pieces, he started with fifteen sailors to swim ashore--he\r\nalone was saved--he says he is much practised in swimming. I spoke of\r\nthis all as a dreadful experience. \"Yes,\" said he, with a twinkle in his\r\neye, \"but the storm cleared out the Germans for us.\" He was thrown\r\nashore insensible, but soon recovered consciousness--had been naked and\r\nwithout food for thirty-six hours. Took a cup of coffee in one hand, and\r\na cup of brandy in the other, and swallowed a little from each\r\nalternately, his refection lasting from nine in the evening till one\r\no'clock at night....\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _To the same_\r\n\r\nWe have not seen the sun in some days.

It seemed to me\r\nlike _broken china_, no complete chord; no perfect result; no\r\narchitectonic.\"\r\n\r\n  [111] Ralph Adams Cram, architect and _littérateur_.\r\n\r\nShe never learned to like what was in those days \"the new music.\" Wagner\r\nand Brahms were anathema to her, as to many another music-lover of her\r\ntime, notably John Sullivan Dwight, long-time Boston's chief musical\r\ncritic. Many a sympathetic talk they had together; one can see him now,\r\nhis eyes burning gentle fire, head nodding, hands waving, as he\r\ndenounced what seemed to him wanton cacophony. She avoided the Symphony\r\nConcerts at which \"the new music\" was exploited; but it was positive\r\npain to her to miss a symphony of Beethoven or Schubert.\r\n\r\nIn March of this year the Saturday Morning Club of Boston gave a\r\nperformance of the \"Antigone\" of Sophocles.\r\n\r\n\"In afternoon to the second representation of the 'Antigone.'... On the\r\nwhole very pathetic and powerful.

So, there's Scripture for you, do you see? As I wrote you\r\nyes'day or day before, things have been _hoppy_ here since my return.\r\nThe elder Agassiz used to mention in his lectures the _Lepidoptera_, and\r\nI think that's the creature (insect, I b'lieve) which infests Boston.\r\nWhat I have hopped for, and whither to, I cannot in the least remember.\r\nFlossy was here, as you know, and I hop't for her. I also 'tended two of\r\nthe festival Oratorios, which were fine, but to me very fatiguing. I\r\nfind that I must take public amusements, when I do take them, in the\r\nafternoon, as in the evening bodily fatigue overmasters even the\r\næsthetic sense, and it is not worth while to pay a large price for the\r\npleasure of wishing one's self at home.... The benefit at Boston Museum\r\nfor the Vincent Hospital netted over $1600. It was a brilliant success,\r\nbut I caught there the first cold I have had since my return from the\r\nFar West.

Read in Martineau, in J. F. C., a little Greek, and\r\nthe miserable 'Les Misérables.'\"\r\n\r\nShe decided to hold some conversations in the Unitarian parsonage, and\r\nwrote out the following topics for them:--\r\n\r\n\"Useful undertakings in this city as existing and needed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How to promote public spirit in American men and women.\"\r\n\r\n\"How to attain a just average estimate of our own people.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is it wise to adopt the plan of universal reading for ourselves\r\nand our young people?\"\r\n\r\n\"In what respects do the foreign civilizations retard, in what do they\r\npromote the progress of our own civilization?\"\r\n\r\nIn August she preached to the women in Sherborn Prison, choosing a \"text\r\nof cheer and uplifting: 'Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the\r\nglory.' Read part of Isaiah 40th. Said that I had wished to bring them\r\nsome word of comfort and exhilaration. Pointed out how the Lord's Prayer\r\nbegins with solemn worship and ascription, aspiring to God's Kingdom,\r\npraying for daily bread and for deliverance from temptation and all\r\nevil; at the close it rises into this joyous strain, 'Thine is the\r\nkingdom,' et cetera. Tried to show how the kingdom is God, the great\r\nprovidential order, before and beyond all earthly government; then the\r\npower, that of perfect wisdom and goodness, the power to know and rule\r\nall things, to be everywhere and ever present, to regulate the mighty\r\nsweep of stars and planets, and, at the same time, to take note of the\r\npoorest and smallest of us; the glory first of the visible universe,\r\nglory of the day and night, of the seasons, glory of the redeeming power\r\nof truth, glory of the inexhaustible patience, of boundless compassion\r\nand love.\"\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed the visit to the prison and was thankful for it.\r\n\r\nA few days later, at a meeting in Newport, she heard a lady demand that\r\nthe children of genius should be set apart from others for special\r\neducation and encouragement, receiving a pension even in their early\r\nyears. She demanded colleges of genius, and a retreat for people of\r\ngenius. By thus fostering juvenile promise, we should produce giants and\r\ndemigods.\r\n\r\n\"I, being called upon, gave the card house a tolerable shaking, and, I\r\nthink, brought it down, for which several people thanked me.\"\r\n\r\nVividly as she lived in the present, the past was never far from her.\r\n\r\n\"Had in the morning at first waking a very vivid mind-picture of my\r\nsweet young mother lying dead, with two or three of us little ones\r\nstanding about her. My brother Henry, two years my senior, laid his\r\nlittle hand upon her forehead and said: 'It is as cold as a stone,' or\r\nsome such comparison. I felt strangely, this morning, the very pain and\r\nagony of that moment, preceding the tragical vision of a life in which\r\nthat central point of nurture, a mother's affection and wisdom, has been\r\nwanting. The scene in my mind was only a vivid reminiscence of what\r\nactually took place, which I never forgot, but I had not felt it as I\r\ndid to-day in many years.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps at heart she was always the little child who used to say to\r\nherself at night, \"Now I will stretch out and make myself as long as I\r\ncan, so that the robbers will think I am a grown-up person, and perhaps\r\nthen they will not touch me!\" \"Then,\" she told us, \"I would stretch\r\nmyself out at full length, and go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nShe was reading Martineau's \"Study of Religion\" this summer with close\r\nattention and deep interest. His writings gave her unfailing delight.\r\nHis portrait hung in her room; on her desk lay always a slender volume\r\nof his \"Prayers,\" her favorite passages marked in pencil. When Louise\r\nChandler Moulton lay dying, the best comfort she could devise for her\r\nwas the loan of this precious little volume.\r\n\r\nThe \"Study of Religion\" is not light reading. We find now and then:\r\n\"Head threatening. Will not tackle Martineau to-day\"; and again: \"My\r\nhead is possessed with my study of Martineau. Had a moment's realizing\r\nsense this morning of the universe as created and constantly re-created\r\nby the thought of the will of God. The phrase is common enough: the\r\nthought, vast beyond human conception.\"\r\n\r\nWhen her head was clear, she studied the great theologian eagerly,\r\ncopying many passages for more complete assimilation.\r\n\r\nSeptember brought \"alarums and excursions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awoke and sprang at once into the worry saddle.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Congress was coming, another \"A.A.W.\" paper to be written,\r\nbeside an opening address for the Mechanics' Fair, and \"1500 words for\r\nBok,\" on some aspect of the American woman.\r\n\r\nShe went to Boston for the opening of the Mechanics' Fair, and sat\r\nbeside Phillips Brooks in the great hall. \"They will not hear us!\" she\r\nsaid. \"No,\" replied Brooks. \"This is the place where little children are\r\n_seen_ and not _heard_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mayor Hart backed up the Tariff while I praised Free Trade.

The coachman, leaving in dudgeon, poisoned the oats with\r\nParis green, a diabolical act which the Journal chronicles with\r\nindignation. Fortunately the deed was discovered in time.\r\n\r\nShe was always thoughtful of animals. During the reign at 241 Beacon\r\nStreet of the little fox-terrier Patch, it often fell to her lot to take\r\nhim out to walk, and she felt this a grave responsibility.\r\n\r\nOne day Patch ran away on Beacon Street, and would not come back when\r\nshe called him. At this instant Dr. Holmes, passing, paused for a\r\nfriendly greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Howe,\" he said, \"I trust this fine morning--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Catch the dog!_\" cried Mrs. Howe. One author flew one way, one the\r\nother; between the two Patch was caught and brought in triumph home.\r\n\r\nOne dog story recalls another. She was in the North Station one day,\r\nabout to start for Gardiner, as was also the setter Diana, crated and\r\nvery unhappy.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Auntie!\" said the baggage-master; \"you set here and be company\r\nfor the dog, and I'll get your check!\"\r\n\r\nShe complied meekly, and was found somewhat later by her escort, \"being\r\ncompany\" for a much-comforted Diana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA SUMMER ABROAD\r\n\r\n1892-1893; _aet._ 73-74\r\n\r\n  Methinks my friends grow beauteous in my sight,\r\n  As the years make their havoc of sweet things;\r\n  Like the intenser glory of the light\r\n  When the sad bird of Autumn sits and sings.\r\n    Ah! woe is me! ah!

My seat was next to\r\nthat of the Countess, who appeared in a very fine dress of peach-blossom\r\ncorded silk, with white lace draperies--on my left was Lord Brooke. Lady\r\nAberdeen introduced me to Lord Kenmare and Dr. Barnardo. The singing of\r\nthe children, a band of rescued waifs, moved me to tears. The military\r\ndrill of the boys and the Maypole dance of the girls were very finely\r\ndone. There are more than 4000 of these children in Barnardo Homes.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 23._ To the first view of the Society of English Portrait\r\nPainters. Portraits on the whole well worth seeing--Herkomers _very_\r\ngood, also Mrs. Anna Lea Merritt's and others. A superb portrait of\r\nCardinal Manning, in full red and ermine. In the evening Lady Aberdeen\r\nsent her carriage for me and I went with her to a meeting of the Liberal\r\nLeague, at which she spoke with a pleasant playfulness, dwelling\r\nsomewhat upon the position that Home Rule, if given to Ireland, would do\r\naway with the ill-feeling of the Irish in America towards England. To\r\nlunch with Lady Aberdeen. Lief Jones came into the meeting while Lady\r\nAberdeen was speaking, and with him Lady Carlisle. She shook hands with\r\nme very cordially. Presently Lief Jones began his address, which was\r\nquite lengthy, presenting the full platform of the Liberal Party. He is\r\na brisk, adroit speaker, and made points in favor of Woman Suffrage, of\r\nHome Rule, of the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales and\r\nScotland, of the eight-hour labor law, of the purchase of the\r\nwaterworks, now owned by eight companies in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 24._ The lunch at Lady Aberdeen's was very pleasant.

He called the Agnostics and Nirvanists a type found in many\r\nclasses, but not a class....\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 27._ To lunch with Mrs. Harland. _Very_ pleasant. Edmund Gosse\r\nwas the guest invited to meet me. He was vivacious, easy, and agreeable.\r\nAlso the composer Marzials....\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 28._ To Westminster Abbey. To Alice, its interest seemed\r\ninexhaustible. It is so, indeed, had one time to be 'strewing violets\r\nall the time,' as E. B. B. said. Longfellow's bust has been placed there\r\nsince my last visit; the likeness is good. I wandered about as long as\r\nmy feet would carry me, thinking sometimes of Gray's question, 'Can\r\nstoried urn,' etc. The Harlands came later and brought the composer of\r\n'Twickenham Ferry.' With Alice to dine at Toynbee Hall. A pleasant\r\ndinner. A bright young man, Bruce by name, related to Abyssinian Bruce,\r\ntook Alice in to dinner--sitting afterwards in Ames's room, where we met\r\nan alderman, a bricklayer, a trades' unionist; later, we heard a lecture\r\nfrom Commander Gladstone, on the Norman-Breton churches, with fine\r\nstereoscopic plates. A violent storm came on, but we managed to ''bus\r\nit' home, taking a cab only at Marble Arch.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 29._ To dine with the Greek Minister at eight o'clock, and to the\r\n_soirée_ of the Academy.\r\n\r\n\"To Chelsea, to call upon Mrs. Oscar Wilde.... He showed me with pride\r\na fine boy of five years. We had some talk of old times, of his visit to\r\nAmerica; I reminded him of the vermilion balcony at which he laughed.\"\r\n[Wilde had complained that the usual pronunciation of these words was\r\nprosaic.]\r\n\r\n\"_June 30...._ Mrs. Oscar Wilde asks us to take tea on Thursday; she has\r\ninvited Walter Pater.... Have writ to James Bryce.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 2._ To see Oscar Wilde's play, 'Lady Windermere's Fan,' at St.\r\nJames's Theatre. We went by invitation to his box, where were Lady Wilde\r\nand Mrs. Oscar. The play was perfectly acted, and is excellent of its\r\nkind, the _motif_ not new, but the _dénouement_ original in treatment.\r\nAfter the play to call on Lady Rothschild, then to Constance\r\nFlower,[114] who showed us her superb house full of treasures of art.\"\r\n\r\n  [114] Lady Battersea.\r\n\r\n\"_July 4._ Mrs. [Edmund] Gosse came and took us to Alma-Tadema's\r\nbeautiful house and garden. He met us very cordially. Mrs. Smalley came.\r\nShe was Wendell Phillips's adopted daughter. I had a pleasant talk with\r\nher and with Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, whom I charged with a friendly message\r\nto Thomas himself. After this to Minister Lincoln's Fourth of July\r\nreception. Harry White, Daisy Rutherford's husband, was introduced.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere she says of this visit to Alma-Tadema:--\r\n\r\n\"His charming wife, once seen, explains some of the features of his\r\nworks. She has yellow hair of the richest color; her eyes also have a\r\nprimrose tint, while her complexion has a pale bloom of its own, most\r\nresembling that of a white rose. She gave us tea from lozenge-shaped\r\ncups, with saucers to match. In the anteroom below we admired a painting\r\nby her own hand, of yellow jonquils and a yellow fan, on a dark\r\nbackground. Her husband seemed pleased when we praised this picture. So\r\nthese two artists occupy their golden nest peaceably, and do not tear\r\neach other's laurels.\r\n\r\n\"Let me say here that the passion for the golden color still prevails.\r\nIn dress, in furniture, in porcelain, it is the prevailing favorite.\r\nLong banished from the social rainbow, it now avenges itself for years\r\nof neglect, and, as every dog must have his day, we will say that the\r\nyellow dog is now to have his, and that the dog-star of this coming\r\nAugust will certainly be of his color.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 6._ With Maud to Liberty's, where she beguiled me, alas! into\r\nbuying a fine black silk mantle for six guineas. To Nutt's in the Strand\r\nfor my Greek books. He had only the 'Nicomathean Ethics,' a fine edition\r\nwhich I bought for twelve shillings. Then to Poole's in Hallowell\r\nStreet, where bought two editions of Aristotle's 'Government,' with\r\nEnglish notes. At Poole's found a copy of Schiller's 'Robbers,' which I\r\nbought for threepence.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 7._ Afternoon tea with Mrs. Oscar, meeting an aunt of Mrs.\r\nWilde's, and Mrs. Burne-Jones. The aunt had been in Japan--she had known\r\nFenollosa and Professor Morse. Then to Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton, who\r\nintroduced a number of people, among them William Sharp, a poet.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 8._ I had rashly promised to lunch with the Brooke Herfords at\r\nHampstead, and to take five-o'clock tea with Mrs. Rebecca Moore at\r\nBedford Place. The Herfords were delightful, and Hampstead is a charming\r\nsuburb. We saw the outside of Mrs. Barbauld's house. Herford said much\r\ngood of Cookson, a farmer's son whom he had known in England from his\r\nbeginnings, a dignified, able, excellent man in his esteem. From this a\r\nlong distance to Mrs. Moore. We reached her in good time, however. Found\r\nher alone, in a pleasant little dwelling. Three ladies came to tea,\r\nwhich was served quite in state--Stepniak[115] came also.\"\r\n\r\n  [115] Sergius Stepniak, a Russian author, then a political exile living\r\n  in England.\r\n\r\n\"_July 9._ To lunch with Lady Henry Somerset. Some talk with Lady H.\r\nabout Mrs. Fawcett, et al.: also concerning Mrs. Martin's intended\r\ncandidacy for the presidency of the United States, which, however futile\r\nin itself, we deplore as tending to throw ridicule upon the Woman's\r\nCause. She thought that the Conservatives would give women the\r\nParliamentary Suffrage in England on account of the great number of\r\nwomen who have joined the Primrose League.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 10._ To the Temple Church. The organ voluntaries, strangely, I\r\nthought, were first Chopin's 'Funeral March,' second the 'Dead March' in\r\n'Saul.' A notable sermon from Dr. Vaughan. The discourse was really\r\nconcerned with the political situation of the moment: the strong\r\ndivision of feeling throughout the country, and the fears of many lest\r\nthe doctrine in which they believe should be overthrown. He said that\r\nthe real Ark of God was the Church Universal, which has been defined as\r\nthe whole company of believing Christian people throughout the world.\r\nMany changes would occur, but the vital principle of religion would\r\nprove itself steadfast--a truly noble sermon, worthy of Phillips\r\nBrooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 12._ To the New Gallery in which were two fine portraits by\r\nHerkomer, a superb one of Paderewski by Tadema, and one of Walter Crane\r\nby Watts, also of distinguished excellence. Later, called upon the\r\nDuchess of Bedford, a handsome woman, sister to Lady Henry Somerset. We\r\ntalked of her sister's visit to the United States. I was well able to\r\npraise her eloquence and her general charm. She has known Lowell well.\r\nWe talked of the old London, the old Boston, both past their palmiest\r\nliterary days. She had heard Phillips Brooks at Westminster Abbey;\r\nadmired him much, but thought him optimistic.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 14._ Was engaged to spend the afternoon at Mrs. Moulton's\r\nreception and to dine with Sebastian Schlesinger.... Many people\r\nintroduced to me--Jerome, author of 'Three Men in a Boat'; Molloy,\r\nsongwriter; Theodore Watts, poetical critic of the Athenæum.'... At the\r\ndinner I met Mrs. O'Connor, who turned out to be a Texan, pretty and\r\nvery pleasant, an Abolitionist at the age of six....\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 15._... To the Harlands', where met Theodore Watts again, and had\r\nsome good talk with him about Browning and other friends. Also Walter\r\nBesant, whom I greeted very warmly as 'our best friend.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 17._ A sermon of surpassing beauty and power from the dear Bishop\r\nof Massachusetts [Phillips Brooks].... The power and spirit of the\r\ndiscourse carried me quite away. We waited to speak with him. I had a\r\ndear grasp of the hand from him. I shook my finger at him and said, 'Is\r\nthis resting?' He laughed and said, 'This is the last time. I shall not\r\nspeak again until I reach Massachusetts.' I wrote some lines on coming\r\nhome, only half expressing my thought, which was that the mother of so\r\nbrave a son could not have had one coward drop of blood in her\r\nveins--another little scrap, too, about the seven devils that\r\nChristianity can cast out. General Walker in the afternoon and the\r\nHarlands to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey left London to join Mrs. Terry at Schwalbach, lingering for a\r\nlittle on the way in Holland and Belgium.\r\n\r\n\"_July 27._ _The Hague._ To see Mesdag and his pictures. Found Mesdag a\r\nhale man of perhaps fifty years--perhaps less; a fine house, and,\r\nbesides his own paintings of which we saw a number, a wonderful\r\ncollection of pictures, mostly modern French, Troyon, Corot, Rousseau,\r\nDaubigny. Some good things by a Roman artist, Mancini, whom Mesdag\r\npraised highly--he is very poor, but has some excellent qualities. A\r\npicture of a little girl reclining on a pillow with a few flowers in her\r\nhand, pleased me very much--he also praised it. Much fine tapestry,\r\nchina, etc., etc. He was gruffly pleasant and hospitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 28._ _Antwerp._ Visited Cathedral and _Musée_. Saw my picture,\r\nRubens's Elevation of the Cross, but felt that my eyesight has dimmed\r\nsince I last saw it. Found Félu, the armless artist, in the _Musée_\r\ncopying a picture of Godiva. He was very glad to see us. Much talk with\r\nhim about Flemish art. A little ramble after dinner and a nibble at a\r\nbric-à-brac shop, which, however, did not become a bite.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 31._ _Cologne._ A great concourse of people awaited the arrival\r\nof a steamer with the Arion Musical Society of New York. Köln choral\r\nsocieties were represented by fine banners and by members in mediæval\r\ncostumes, very picturesque. The steamer came alongside with many flags,\r\nforemost among them our own dear 'Stars and Stripes.' We waved\r\nhandkerchiefs vigorously as these last passed by, and were saluted by\r\ntheir bearers.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 2._ Left Cologne by Rhine steamer. I remember these boats as\r\ncrowded, dirty, and very comfortless, but I found this one as well\r\nappointed as need be. Spent the day mostly on deck enjoying the great\r\nbeauty and romance of the trip.... I chilled myself pretty badly on\r\ndeck, but stayed up until perhaps half-past seven. A very young\r\nWestphalian on board astonished us all by his powers of drinking and of\r\nsmoking. He talked with me; said, '_Sie sind deutsch,_' which I denied.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 3._ Reached Schwalbach at three. My dear sister [Mrs. Terry]\r\ncame out to greet us. The meeting was a little tearful, but also\r\ncheerful. Much has passed and passed away in these eventful years....\r\nPresently Louisa and I were as though we had not been parted at all.\r\nShe is little changed, and retains her old grace and charm of manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 4._ Out early with my sister. We have a regular and restful\r\nplan of living. Meet after dinner, coffee with my sister at half-past\r\nfour, supper at half-past seven, in the evening reading aloud and\r\nconversation. I am miserable with pain, probably rheumatic, in my left\r\nhip. Think I must have got a chill on the Rhine boat. I say nothing\r\nabout this. Daisy and Wintie [Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Chanler] came this\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 7._ To Anglican service with my dear sister. A dull sermon. The\r\nservice indifferently read--just the stereotyped Church of England\r\narticle. My dreadful hip joint does not ache to-day, and I am ready to\r\nskip about with joy at the relief even if it prove but temporary. The\r\npain has been pretty severe and I have said nought about it, fearing\r\ntreatment.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 9._ Read Aristotle, as I have done all these days. Took up St.\r\nPaul's Epistle to the Romans, with a more distinct view than heretofore\r\nof his attitude relative to them, and theirs to him. Walked out with my\r\nsister, and saw at the bric-à-brac booth near the Stahlbrunnen a ring\r\ncomposed of a fine garnet, set with fine diamonds, wonderfully cheap,\r\n136 marks--I foolishly wanted it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 16._ _Heidelberg._ To the Castle--an endless walk and climb. I\r\nwas here in 1843, a bride, with dear Chev, my dearest brother Marion,\r\nand my cousin, Henry Hall Ward. We went to the Wolfbrunnen to\r\nbreakfast--went on ponies to the Castle, where we wandered at will, and\r\nsaw the mighty tun. Some French people were wandering there also, and\r\none of them, a lady with a sweet soprano voice, sang a song of which the\r\nrefrain was: '_Comme une étoile au firmament_.' H. H. Ward long after\r\nfound this song somewhere. His voice has now been silent for twenty\r\nyears, dear Marion's for forty-six, and here I come to-day, with my\r\ngrown-up granddaughter, whom dear Chev only knew as a baby. How long the\r\ntime seems, and yet how short! Two generations have grown up since then\r\nin our family. My sister Louisa, then a young beauty, is here with me, a\r\ngrandmother with grandchildren nearly grown. 'So teach us to number our\r\ndays.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the second and third generations that the two sisters could\r\nhardly have been lovelier in that far-off springtime than now in the\r\nmellow beauty of their autumn. It was a delight to see them together, a\r\nhigh privilege to sit by and listen to the interchange of precious\r\nmemories:--\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember--\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you remember again--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_August 24._ _Sonnenberg._... At breakfast an elderly lady seemed to\r\nlook at me and to smile. I supposed her to be one of my Club ladies, or\r\nsome one who had entertained me, so presently I asked her if she were\r\n'one of my acquaintances.' She replied that she was not, but would be\r\npleased to make my acquaintance. We met soon after in one of the\r\ncorridors; having incautiously mentioned my name, I asked for hers, she\r\nreplied, 'Sforza--Duchess Sforza Cesarini.' She had been attracted by my\r\nBreton caps, and especially by Daisy's beautiful version of this simple\r\nadornment. She is a reader of Rosmini.\"[116]\r\n\r\n  [116] Rosmini-Serbati, a noted philosopher and founder of the order of\r\n  the Brothers of Charity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Duchess confessed afterward that she had requested her maid to\r\nobserve and copy the cap, and had been somewhat troubled in mind lest\r\nshe had been guilty of a constructive discourtesy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_September 3._ Received and answered a letter from Jenkin Lloyd Jones,\r\ninforming me of my election to an Advisory Board to hold a World's\r\nUnitarian Congress at Chicago in September, 1893. I have accepted this.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 4._ My last day at Sonnenberg.... Gave my sister my little\r\nold Greek Lexicon, long a cherished companion. I had thought of reading\r\nthe family one of my sermons, but my throat was troublesome and no one\r\nasked me to do anything of the kind. They wished to hear 'Pickwick,' and\r\na long reading was held in my room, the fire in the grate helping to\r\ncheer us.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 15._ Left Montreux for Paris. Reed brought me a beautiful\r\nyellow rose, half-blown, upon which I needs must exercise my old trick\r\nof versification. Paper I had none--the back of a pasteboard box held\r\none stanza, the cover of a Tauchnitz the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 18._ Heard to-day of the noble poet, Whittier's death. What\r\na great heart is gone with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 22._ _Liverpool._ Embarked at about ten in the morning.\r\nEdward Atkinson, wife and daughter on board, a valuable addition to our\r\nresources.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 29._ _At sea._ I said in my mind: 'There is nothing in me\r\nwhich can redeem me from despair over my poor life and wasted\r\nopportunities. That redemption which I seek must be in Thee. There is no\r\nprogress in the mere sense of ill-desert. I must pass on from it to\r\nbetter effort beyond, self-reproach is negative: woe is me that I was\r\nborn! Amendment must have positive ground.' I wrote some lines in which\r\na bit of sea-weed shining in the sun seemed as an illustration of the\r\nlight which I hope to gain.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 30._ A performance of Jarley's Wax-works in the evening was\r\nmuch enjoyed. Edward Atkinson as Mrs. Partington in my witch hat recited\r\nsome merry nonsense of Hood's about European travel.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 2._ _Boston._ In the early morning John M. Forbes's yacht, the\r\nWild Duck, hovered around us, hoping to take off his daughter, Mrs.\r\nRussell.... Quite a number of us embraced this opportunity with\r\ngratitude....\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 3._ All seems like a dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 7._ _Newport._ I begin my life here with a prayer that the\r\nprolongation of my days on earth may be for good to myself and others,\r\nthat I may not sink into senile folly or grossness, nor yet wander into\r\næsthetic conceit, but carry the weight of my experience in humility, in\r\nall charity, and in a loving and serviceable spirit.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last entry in the Journal for 1892 strikes the keynote of what was\r\nto prove the most absorbing interest of the coming year.\r\n\r\n\"_December 31._ Farewell, dear 1892. You were the real _quattro_\r\ncentenary of Columbus's discovery, although we have been so behind time\r\nas not to be ready to celebrate this before 1893. 1492 was indeed a year\r\nmomentous to humanity.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo her many cares was added now work for the Columbian Exhibition at\r\nChicago. The Woman's Department of the World's Fair was ably\r\nadministered by Mrs. Potter Palmer, who consulted her frequently, her\r\nexperiences in the New Orleans Cotton Centennial proving useful in the\r\nColumbian Exhibition. The \"Twelve-o'Clock Talks,\" so successful in the\r\nCrescent City, were, at her suggestion, repeated at Chicago, and proved\r\nmost valuable. The Association for the Advancement of Women and many\r\nother associations were to meet in Chicago this year. She writes to the\r\nReverend Jenkin Lloyd Jones concerning the Parliament of Religions and\r\nthe Unitarian Congress; to Aaron Powell touching the Congress on Social\r\nPurity. There are letters, too, about the Alliance of Unitarian Women,\r\nthe Congress of Representative Women, and the Association of Women\r\nMinisters and Preachers.\r\n\r\n\"_January 7._ [_Boston._] To speak to the Daughters of the American\r\nRevolution at the house of Miss Rebecca W. Brown. I had dreaded the\r\nmeeting, feeling that I must speak of suffrage in connection with the\r\nnew womanhood, and anticipating a cold or angry reception. What was my\r\nsurprise at finding my words, which were not many, warmly welcomed!\r\nTruly, the hour is at hand!\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 8._ To speak for Dr. Clisby at Women's Educational and\r\nIndustrial Union. I had dreaded this, too, fearing not to interest my\r\naudience. The occasion was very pleasant to me, and, I think, to them;\r\nMrs. Waters endorsed my estimate of Phillips Brooks as a perfectly\r\ndisinterested worker. Mrs. Catlin of New York agreed in my praise of\r\nBishop Henry C. Potter on the same grounds; both also spoke well in\r\nrelation to my most prominent point--emancipation from the slavery of\r\nself.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 23._ Oh! and alas! dear Phillips Brooks died suddenly this\r\nmorning at half-past six. Alas! for Christendom, which he did so much to\r\nunite by redeeming his domain in it from superstition, formalism, and\r\nuncharity. Oh! to have such a reputation, and _deserve it_!\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 4._ To-day have been allowed to visit the study of the late dear\r\nBishop of Massachusetts. I took this pin from his pincushion, to keep\r\nfor a souvenir. Made Rosalind write down the names of a number of the\r\nbooks. The library is a very generous one, comprising a large sweep of\r\nstudy and opinion. A charming frieze over the large window had been\r\npainted by Mrs. Whitman. We entered with a reverent feeling, as if in a\r\nsacred place.... The dining-room, and his seat thereat, with portraits\r\nof his parents and grandfather. The mother was of his color, dark of\r\neyes and hair, strong temperament, otherwise no special resemblance. His\r\nfather looked substantial but not remarkable.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn mid-May she went to Chicago, to take part in the World's Congress of\r\nRepresentative Women, and in many of the other congresses and\r\nconferences of that notable year.\r\n\r\n\"_May 16._ _Chicago._ Was appointed to preside to-day over a Report\r\nConvention [of the above Congress]; went to Room 6 of the Art Palace and\r\nfound no one. Mrs. Kennard came presently, and Mrs. Clara B. Colby, who\r\nstood by me bravely--when about a dozen had gathered I opened the\r\nmeeting. Mrs. Colby read reports for two associations, British, I think.\r\nA German delegate had a long report written in German, which it would\r\nhave been useless for her to read. She accordingly reported as she was\r\nable, in very funny English, I helping her when she was at a loss for a\r\nword. Her evident earnestness made a good impression. I reported for\r\nA.A.W., partly in writing, partly _extempore_. In the evening read my\r\npaper on the Moral Initiative as regards Women. The hall [of Washington]\r\nwas frightfully cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 17._ Going to the Art Palace this afternoon I found an audience\r\nwaiting in one of the small halls with no speaker. Madame C. had engaged\r\nto speak on musical education. I was requested to fill the breach,\r\nwhich I did, telling of the Boston Conservatory of Music, early music in\r\nBoston, and down to our time. Had an ovation afterwards of friendly\r\nhandshaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 19._ Meeting of National Alliance of Unitarian Women.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 27._ My seventy-fourth birthday. Thank God for my continued life,\r\nhealth, and bodily and mental powers. My prayer to Him is that, whether\r\nI am to have a year, a month, a week, or a day more, it may be for good\r\nto myself and others.\r\n\r\n\"Went to the Columbian Exhibition. Thomas's Orchestra playing for Mrs.\r\nPotter Palmer's reception given to the women of the Press Association.\r\nLater I went into the model kitchen where tea was served by the\r\nCingalese. Mrs. Palmer asked me to follow her brief address with a few\r\nwords. I did this and told of its being my birthday, at which Mrs.\r\nPalmer gave me her bouquet of carnations, and the ladies present rose\r\nand waved handkerchiefs. Read my sermon for to-morrow twice and feared\r\nit might not strike a keynote here.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 28._ Rather nervous about getting to town in time for my service\r\nat the Unitarian Church,--we were in good time. My mind was much\r\nexercised about my prayer, I having decided to offer the longer one,\r\nwhich I did, I hope, acceptably. I don't think that the sermon _told_ as\r\nit did in Boston. The church is not easy to speak in. Mr. Fenn said a\r\nfew words very tenderly about his pleasure in receiving me into his\r\npulpit. The pulpit roses were given me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 29._ Went to the Exposition, where met Mrs. Charlotte Emerson\r\nBrown. Went with her to her space in the Organization Room. She will\r\nreceive and care for my exhibits. Saw the very fine collection of club\r\nmanuals, histories, etc.\"[117]\r\n\r\n  [117] Mrs. Charlotte Emerson Brown was at this time president of the\r\n  General Federation of Women's Clubs, and had prepared this exhibit, the\r\n  first of its kind in club history.\r\n\r\n\"_May 30._ Made a little spurt to begin my screed for Aaron Powell's\r\nmeeting on Sunday. Went with dear Maud and Helen Gardner to the Fair.\r\nSide-shows as follows: Cairo Street, Cairo Theatre, Soudanese dancers\r\n(very black savages wearing top tufts of black hair or wool, clothed in\r\nstrips of dirty white cotton cloth), old Vienna, dinner at Vienna\r\nrestaurant....\r\n\r\n\"The Cairo dancing was simply horrid, no touch of grace in it, only a\r\nmost deforming movement of the whole abdominal and lumbar region. We\r\nthought it indecent. The savages were much better, though they only\r\nstamp their bare feet and clap their hands in rhythm without music. One\r\nhad a curious smooth lyre, which seemed to give no sound. Their teeth\r\nwere beautifully white and regular. One of them came up to me and said,\r\n'Mamma,' as if to indicate my age. Then into a bark hut, to see the\r\nSoudanese baby dance--a dear little child that danced very funnily to a\r\ntum-tum.\"\r\n\r\nEarly June found her back in Boston and hard at work.\r\n\r\n\"_June 8._ Finished my screed for the July 'Forum.' Subject, 'A Proper\r\nObservance of the Fourth of July.' I have prayed over this piece of work\r\nas over all the others which have been strung, one after another, in\r\nthis busiest of years for me. I have also despaired of it, and am not\r\nyet sure of its acceptance.\"\r\n\r\nNext day she felt that she \"must see the last of dear Edwin Booth.\" The\r\nJournal describes his funeral at length; \"the sun perfectly golden\r\nbehind the trees.\" She brought away a bit of evergreen from the grave,\r\nand at church, two days later, \"had the sexton slide it in among the\r\npulpit flowers; afterward brought it home. Perhaps a silly fancy, but an\r\naffectionate one.\" She wrote a poem in memory of Mr. Booth, \"not\r\naltogether to my satisfaction.\" She felt his death as a real loss; he\r\nremained always to her a beautiful and heroic figure, connected with a\r\ngreat time.\r\n\r\n\"_June 15._ 'Thus far the Lord has led me on.' I have had many pieces of\r\nwork to accomplish, and when almost despairing, seemed to have been\r\nuplifted right into my working seat, and so have fulfilled my tasks as\r\nwell as I was able. Have still my Fourth of July poem to write, and wish\r\nto write a poem in memory of Edwin Booth. I'm hungry, oh! how hungry,\r\nfor rest and reading. Must work very hard for A.A.W. this season....\"\r\n\r\nShe went to Harvard Class Day this summer, her eldest grandson, Samuel\r\nPrescott Hall, being of the graduating class; drove out to Cambridge in\r\na pouring rain, and enjoyed the occasion. \"I saw my Boy march with his\r\nfellows; when they cheered Weld, I waved a napkin.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer sped by on wings of study and work; she was lame, but that\r\ngave her the more time for writing. The Journal records many letters;\r\namong other things, \"a short screed for the man who asks to be convinced\r\nthat there is such a thing as soul.\" In September she spread other wings\r\nand flew back to Chicago for the Parliament of Religions, and some last\r\nImpressions of the Dream City of the World's Fair.\r\n\r\n\"_September 23._ Went to the Parliament of Religions where Jenkin Lloyd\r\nJones put me on the platform. Heard Dr. Momery, who gave a pleasant,\r\nliberal, and spirited address, a little _elementary_, as he closed by\r\nreciting 'Abou Ben Adhem,' which is as familiar to Americans as A B C.\r\nIn the evening went to meet, or rather find, the women ministers. Miss\r\nChapin excused herself from attending and asked me to run the\r\nmeeting.... I read my short screed, briefly narrating my own efforts to\r\nfound an association of women ministers. Miss Putnam and Mary Graves\r\nwere appointed as a committee to consult with me as to a plan of\r\norganization.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 26._ Up early.... Visited the German village, castle and\r\nmuseum, the mining, agricultural, shoe and leather buildings for a brief\r\nspace. Made a turn in the Ferris Wheel.... Mary Graves came for me, and\r\nwe started for the Parliament in good time. The first speaker was\r\nintolerably narrow and out of place, insisting upon the hostility of\r\nChrist to all ethnic religions. I could not refrain from taking him up a\r\nlittle, very mildly. I was received with applause and the Chautauqua\r\nsalute, and my brief speech (fourteen minutes without notes) was much\r\napplauded. I was very thankful for this opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis impromptu speech made a deep impression. In the newspaper reports\r\ngreat stress was laid on it, with singular result. She was amazed next\r\nday to hear her name roared out in the Midway Plaisance by a touter who\r\nstood at the gateway of one of the sideshows where some Orientals were\r\nat prayer.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, all ye Christian people,\" the man cried. \"Come in and see\r\nthese devout Mohammedans at their devotions. Julia Ward Howe has knocked\r\nthe orthodoxy into a cocked hat.\"\r\n\r\nThe quiet little figure, passing in the motley throng, paused for a\r\nmoment and looked with astonishment into the touter's face, which gave\r\nno sign of recognition.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said a friend, who happened to come up at the moment,--\"this is\r\nfame!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\"DIVERS GOOD CAUSES\"\r\n\r\n1890-1896; _aet._ 71-77\r\n\r\nA DREAM OF THE HEARTHSTONE\r\n\r\n  A figure by my fireside stayed,\r\n  Plain was her garb, and veiled her face;\r\n  A presence mystical she made,\r\n  Nor changed her attitude, nor place.\r\n\r\n  Did I neglect my household ways\r\n  For pleasure, wrought of pen or book?\r\n  She sighed a murmur of dispraise,\r\n  At which, methought, the rafters shook.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Now, who art thou that didst not smile\r\n  When I my maddest jest devised?\r\n  Who art thou, stark and grim the while\r\n  That men my time and measure prized?\"\r\n\r\n  Without her pilgrim staff she rose,\r\n  Her weeds of darkness cast aside;\r\n  More dazzling than Olympian snows\r\n  The beauty that those weeds did hide.\r\n\r\n  Most like a solemn symphony\r\n  That lifts the heart from lowly things,\r\n  The voice with which she spake to me\r\n  Did loose contrition at its springs.\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, Duty! Visitor Divine,\r\n  Take all the wealth my house affords,\r\n  But make thy holy methods mine;\r\n  Speak to me thy surpassing words!\r\n\r\n  \"Neglected once and undiscerned,\r\n  I pour my homage at thy feet.\r\n  Till I thy sacred law have learned\r\n  Nor joy, nor life can be complete.\"\r\n\r\n                                         J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the closing decade of the nineteenth century a new growth of \"causes\"\r\nclaimed her time and sympathy. The year 1891 saw the birth of the\r\nSociety of American Friends of Russian Freedom; modelled on a similar\r\nsociety which, with \"Free Russia\" as its organ, was doing good work in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe object of the American society was \"to aid by all moral and legal\r\nmeans the Russian patriots in their efforts to obtain for their country\r\npolitical freedom and self-government.\" Its circular was signed by\r\nThomas Wentworth Higginson, Julia Ward Howe, John Greenleaf Whittier,\r\nJames Russell Lowell, George Kennan, William Lloyd Garrison, Henry I.\r\nBowditch, F. W. Bird, Alice Freeman Palmer, Charles G. Ames, Edward L.\r\nPierce, Frank B. Sanborn, Annie Fields, E. Benjamin Andrews, Lillie B.\r\nChace Wyman, Samuel L. Clemens, and Joseph H. Twitchell.\r\n\r\nJames Russell Lowell, writing to Francis J. Garrison in 1891, says:\r\n\"Between mote and beam, I think _this_ time Russia has the latter in her\r\neye, though God knows we have motes enough in ours. So you may take my\r\nname even if it be in vain, as I think it will be.\"\r\n\r\nIt was through this society that she made the acquaintance of Mme.\r\nBreschkovskaya,[118] the Russian patriot whose sufferings and sacrifices\r\nhave endeared her to all lovers of freedom. The two women felt instant\r\nsympathy with each other. Mme. Breschkovskaya came to 241 Beacon Street\r\nmore than once, and they had much talk together. On one of these\r\noccasions our mother was asked to play some of her own compositions. Her\r\nfingers strayed from one thing to another; finally, on a sudden\r\nimpulse, she struck the opening chords of the Russian National Hymn.\r\nMme. Breschkovskaya started forward. \"Ah, madame!\" she cried, \"do not\r\nplay that! You cannot know what that air means to us Russians!\"\r\n\r\n  [118] Now (1915) a political prisoner in Siberia: she escaped, but was\r\n  recaptured and later removed to a more remote place of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAt a great meeting in Faneuil Hall the two spoke, in English and Russian\r\nrespectively, while other addresses were in Yiddish and Polish. All were\r\nfrantically applauded by the polyglot audience which filled the hall to\r\noverflowing. William Dudley Foulke presided at this meeting. Speaking\r\nwith our mother several years later, he reminded her of the occasion,\r\nwhich he thought might have been of a somewhat anarchistic tendency. He\r\nwas not sure, he said, that they had not made fools of themselves. \"One\r\ncan afford,\" she replied, \"to make a very great fool of one's self in\r\nsuch a cause as that of Russian liberty!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year 1891 saw the birth of another society in which she was deeply\r\ninterested, the Women's Rest Tour Association, whose object was \"simply\r\nto make it easier for women who need a trip abroad to take one.\"\r\n\r\nIt was proved \"that the sum of $250 was sufficient to enable a woman of\r\nsimple tastes to enjoy a summer's vacation in Europe\"; a travelling fund\r\nwas established from which women could borrow, or--in certain\r\ncases--receive gifts; a handbook was issued, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn an unobtrusive way, the Women's Rest Tour Association did and\r\ncontinues to do much good. She was its president to the close of her\r\nlife, and in silent and lovely tribute to her memory the office has\r\nsince then remained vacant.\r\n\r\nIn the early nineties all Christendom was aroused by the outrages\r\ncommitted by the Turks in Armenia. From almost every Christian country\r\nrose a cry of horror: indignation meetings were called; protest,\r\ndenunciation, and appeal were the order of the day. In Boston a meeting\r\nwas held at Faneuil Hall (November 26, 1894), called together by the\r\nBoston Armenian Relief Committee. She was on the platform, and spoke\r\nfrom her heart.\r\n\r\n\"I could not,\" she says, \"stay away from this meeting. My heart was\r\nhere, and I came, not so much to speak, as to hear what is to be done\r\nabout this dreadful trouble. For something must be done. I have to pray\r\nGod night and morning that He would find some way to stay this terrible\r\ntide of slaughter....\r\n\r\n\"I recall the first action of Florence Nightingale when she went to take\r\ncare of the sick and wounded in the Crimean War. She found many things\r\nwanting for the comfort of the soldiers in the hospitals, but she could\r\nnot get at them. Some seal or mandate was waited for. 'The men are\r\nsuffering,' Florence Nightingale said. 'Break in the doors--open the\r\nboxes--give me the blankets and medicines. I must have them!'--and so\r\nshe did. Now, the fleets of the Western nations are waiting for some\r\ndiplomatic development which shall open the way for action. I think that\r\nwe, the United States of America, are now called upon to play the part\r\nof Florence Nightingale; to take our stand and insist upon it that the\r\nslaughter shall cease. Oh! let us give money, let us give life, but let\r\nus stand by our principles of civil and religious liberty. I am sure\r\nthat if we do so, we shall have behind us, and with us, that great\r\nspirit which has been in the world for nineteen centuries past, with\r\never-increasing power. Let us set up in these distant lands the shelter\r\nof the blessed Cross, and of all that it stands for, and let us make it\r\navailing once and forever.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after this the Friends of Armenia organized as a society, she being\r\nits president. Among its members were William Lloyd Garrison, Henry\r\nBlackwell and his devoted daughter Alice, and M. H. Gulesian. Singly or\r\nin company they went about, through Massachusetts, holding meetings,\r\nrousing the people to aid in the protest of Christendom against\r\nheathendom, of mercy against cruelty. \"Spoke for Armenia,\" is a frequent\r\nentry in the Journal of these days.\r\n\r\nIn one of these addresses she said:--\r\n\r\n\"It may be asked, where is the good of our assembling here? what can a\r\nhandful of us effect against this wicked and remorseless power, so far\r\nbeyond our reach, so entrenched in the selfishness of European nations\r\nwho are the creditors of the bankrupt state, and who keep her alive in\r\nthe hope of recovering the debt which she owes them? The walls of this\r\nold hall should answer this question. They saw the dawn of our own\r\nlarger liberties. They heard the first indignant plea of Wendell\r\nPhillips when, in the splendor of his youth, he took the field for the\r\nemancipation of a despised race which had no friends. So, on this sacred\r\narena, I throw down the glove which challenges the Turkish Government\r\nto its dread account. What have we for us in this contest? The spirit of\r\ncivilization, the sense of Christendom, the heart of humanity. All of\r\nthese plead for justice, all cry out against barbarous warfare of which\r\nthe victims are helpless men, tender women and children. We invoke here\r\nthe higher powers of humanity against the rude instincts in which the\r\nbrute element survives and rules.\r\n\r\n  \"Aid us, paper, aid us, pen,\r\n  Aid us, hearts of noble men!\r\n\r\n\"Aid us, shades of champions who have led the world's progress! Aid us,\r\nthou who hast made royal the scourge and crown of thorns!\"\r\n\r\nAfter hearing these words, Frederick Greenhalge, then Governor of\r\nMassachusetts, said to her, \"Ah, Mrs. Howe, you have given us a prose\r\nBattle Hymn!\"\r\n\r\nThe Friends of Armenia did active and zealous service through a number\r\nof years, laboring not only for the saving of life, but for the support\r\nand education of the thousands of women and orphans left desolate.\r\nSchools and hospitals were established in Armenia, and many children\r\nwere placed in American homes, where they grew up happily, to\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nNearly ten years later, a new outbreak of Turkish ferocity roused the\r\n\"Friends\" to new fervor, and once again her voice was lifted up in\r\nprotest and appeal. She wrote to President Roosevelt, imploring him to\r\nsend some one from some neighboring American consulate to investigate\r\nconditions. He did so, and his action prevented an impending massacre.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, fresh persecutions brought the organization once more\r\ntogether. The Armenians of Boston reminded her of the help she had given\r\nbefore, and asked her to write to President Taft. This she promptly did.\r\nBriefly, this cause with so many others was to be relinquished only with\r\nlife itself.\r\n\r\nOn the fly-leaf of the Journal for 1894 is written: \"I take possession\r\nof the New Year in the name of Faith, Hope, and Charity. J. W. Howe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Head bewildered with correspondence, bills, etc. Must get out of this\r\nor die.\"\r\n\r\n\"A threatening head, and a week before me full of functions. I feel weak\r\nin mind and dazed with confusions, but will trust in God and keep my\r\npowder dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hearing on Suffrage, Green Room, 10 A.M. My mind was unusually clear\r\nfor this speaking. I determined to speak of the two sorts of people,\r\nthose who naturally wish to keep the best things for themselves, and\r\nthose whose appreciation of these things is such that they cannot\r\nrefrain from spreading them abroad, giving freely as they have received.\r\nI was able to follow and apply this tolerably in my ten-minute\r\nspeech....\"\r\n\r\n\"Annual meeting of Rest Tour Association; a delightful meeting, full of\r\ngood suggestions.

I said, 'He ought to play with his boots on his\r\nhands.' He played two curious compositions of Liszt's: St. Francis's\r\nSermon to the Birds and to the Fishes--much roaring as of old ocean in\r\nthe second.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Boston._ Attended Mrs. Mary Hemenway's funeral in the morning.... A\r\ngreat loss she is, but her life has been a great gain. Would that more\r\nrich men had such daughters! That more rich women had such a heart!...\"\r\n\r\n\"C. G. A. preached a funeral sermon on Mrs. Hemenway. As he opened his\r\nlips, I said to myself, 'What can he teach us that her life has not\r\ntaught us?' The sermon, however, was most instructive. Such a life makes\r\nan epoch, and should establish a precedent. If one woman can be so\r\ndisinterested and so wise, others can emulate her example. I, for one,\r\nfeel that I shall not forget this forcible presentation of the aspect of\r\nsuch a character, of such a history. God send that her mantle may fall\r\nupon this whole community, stimulating each to do what he or she can for\r\nhumanity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _To Maud_\r\n\r\n                               241 BEACON STREET, April 21, 1894.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST DEAR CHILD,--\r\n\r\n... Let me tell you of the abolition of the old Fast Day and of the new\r\nholiday, April 19, ordained in its stead. This, you may remember, is the\r\nanniversary of the Battle of Lexington. The celebration here was quite\r\non a grand scale. The bells of the old North Church were rung and the\r\nlanterns hung out. A horseman, personating Paul Revere, rode out to\r\nrouse the farmers of Concord and Lexington, and a sham fight, imitating\r\nthe real one, actually came off with an immense concourse of spectators.\r\nThe Daughters of the American Revolution had made me promise to go to\r\ntheir celebration at the Old South, where I sat upon the platform with\r\nMrs. Sam Eliot, Regent, and with the two orators of the day, Professor\r\nChanning and Edward Hale. I wore the changeable silk that Jenny Nelson\r\nmade, the Gardner cashmere, and the _bonnet_ which little you made for\r\nme last summer. McAlvin refreshed it a little, and it looked most proud.\r\nSam Eliot, who presided, said to me, \"Why, Julia, you look like the\r\nqueen that I said you were, long ago. If I could do so, I would\r\nintroduce you as the Queen.\" I tell you all this in order that you may\r\nknow that I was all right as to appearance. I was to read a poem, but\r\nhad not managed to compose one, so I copied out \"Our Country\" from\r\n\"Later Lyrics,\" and read it as I was never able to read it before. For\r\nthe first time, it _told_ upon the audience. This was because it was\r\nespecially appropriate to the occasion....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_May 11._ Opposed the dispensing with the reading of State Reports. The\r\nmaker of the motion said that we could read these at home. I said, 'Yes,\r\nand we can read the Bible at home, but we like to go to church and hear\r\nit read.' Finished my screed for this evening and licked my Columbus\r\npoem into shape, the dear Lord helping me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _To Maud_\r\n\r\n                                  PLAINFIELD, N.J., May 16, 1894.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST MAUD,--\r\n\r\n... First place, I had a visit from Laura. We threw the ball daily, and\r\nhad lunches and punches. We went to hear de Koven's \"Robin Hood,\" the\r\nmusic of which is strongly _reminiscent_, and also saw Mounet-Sully's\r\n\"Hamlet,\" a very wonderful piece of acting. Flossy and I had three days\r\nof conventioning in Philadelphia, last week. Flossy's little speech was\r\none of the best at the convention, and was much applauded. I was\r\nreceived on all hands with affectionate goodwill.... There seemed to be,\r\namong the Eastern women, a desire to make _me_ president [of the General\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs]. This I immediately put out of the question\r\nand Mrs. Cheney stood by me, saying that Massachusetts would not see me\r\nkilled with work. It would indeed have been out of the question, as the\r\nposition is probably one of great labor and responsibility....\r\n\r\n                                           YOUR MOTHEREST MOTHER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Seventy-fifth Birthday brought the customary festivities. The\r\nnewspapers sent reporters; she had a word for each. To the\r\nrepresentative of the \"Advertiser,\" she said, \"I think that I enjoy the\r\ncoming of old age with its peacefulness, like the going down of the sun.\r\nIt is very lovely! I am so glad to be remembered by so many. The\r\ntwilight of life is indeed a pleasant season!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To Maud_\r\n\r\n                                 241 BEACON STREET, May 31, 1894.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST CHILD,--\r\n\r\nI send you a budget of tributes to my birthday. The \"Springfield\r\nRepublican\" has a bit about it, with a good and gratifying poem from\r\nSanborn. _Really_, dear, between you and me what a old humbug it is! But\r\nno matter--if people will take me for much better than I am, I can't\r\nhelp it, and must only try to live up to my reputation.... I received a\r\ngood letter from you, \"a little scolding at first,\" but \"soft rebukes\r\nwith blessings ended,\" as Longfellow describes the admonitions of his\r\nfirst wife.... At the Suffrage Festival, Governor Long presided, and in\r\nintroducing me waved a branch of lilies, saying, \"In the beauty of the\r\nlilies she is still, at seventy-five.\" Now that I call handsome, don't\r\nyou?...\r\n\r\nFlossy had a very successful afternoon tea while I was with her. She had\r\nthree ladies of the _Civitas_ Club and invited about one hundred of her\r\nneighbors to hear them read papers. It wasn't suffrage, but it was good\r\ngovernment, which is about the same thing. The parlors looked very\r\npretty. I should think seventy or eighty came and all were delighted.\r\nDid I write you that at Philadelphia she made the most admired speech of\r\nthe occasion? She wore the brocade, finely made over, with big black\r\nvelvet top sleeves and rhinestone comb, and they 'plauded and 'plauded,\r\nand I sat, grinning like a chessy cat, oh! so welly pleased.\r\n\r\n\"_July 1._ [_Oak Glen._] Despite my severe fatigue went in town to\r\nchurch; desired in my mind to have some good abiding thought given me to\r\nwork for and live by. The best thought that came to me was something\r\nlike this: we are careful of our fortune and of our reputation. We are\r\nnot careful enough of our lives. Society is built of these lives in\r\nwhich each should fit his or her place, like a stone fitly joined by the\r\nbuilder. We die, but _the life we have lived remains_, and helps to\r\nbuild society well or ill. Later on I thought that it sometimes seems as\r\nif a rope or chain of mercy would be let down to pull some of us out of\r\nsin and degradation, out of the Hell of passion. If we have taken hold\r\nof it and have been rescued, shall we not work to have others drawn up\r\nwith us? At such moments, I remember my old wish to speak to the\r\nprisoners, never fully realized.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 13._ Finished my poem for the Bryant Centenary, of which I have\r\ndespaired; my mind has seemed dull of late, and I have had a hard time\r\nwith this poem, writing what appeared to me bald-doggerel, with no\r\nuniting thought. In these last three days, I have hammered upon it, and\r\nbettered it, coming in sight of a better vein and to-day, not without\r\nprayerful effort, I got it about ready, _D.G._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _To Maud_\r\n\r\n                                       OAK GLEN, August 27, 1894.\r\n\r\n... An interesting French gentleman has been giving readings at Mrs.\r\nColeman's. He read us Corneille's \"Cid\" last evening with much dash and\r\nspirit. It is a famous play, but the sentiment is very stilted, like\r\ngoing up a ladder to shave one's self. I was at Providence on Friday to\r\nmeet a literary club of ladies. I read to them the greater part of my\r\nplay, \"Hippolytus,\" written the summer before Sammy was born, for Edwin\r\nBooth. It seemed very ghostly to go back to the ambitions of that time,\r\nbut the audience, a parlor one, expressed great satisfaction.... I\r\n'fesses that I did attend the Bryant Centenary Festival at Cummington,\r\nMass. I read a poem written for the occasion.

Wonders will never cease. The meeting was\r\nin behalf of the colored school at Tuskegee, which we A.A.W.'s visited\r\nafter our Congress. I dressed myself with unusual care. Dr. Donald gave\r\nme the place of honor and took me in and upon the platform in the\r\nchancel where we all sat. Governor Greenhalge was the first speaker. I\r\ncame about fourth, and to my surprise was distinctly heard all over the\r\nhouse. You may easily imagine that I enjoyed this very much, although it\r\nwas rather an anxious moment when I stepped forward to speak.... We are\r\nall much shocked at the death of dear Robert Louis Stevenson of which\r\nyou will have heard before this reaches you. What a loss to literature!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_January 1, 1895._ I was awake very early and made the prayer that\r\nduring this year I might not say one uncharitable word, or be guilty of\r\none ungenerous action.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 6_.... My afternoon service at the Women's Educational and\r\nIndustrial Union.... The day was very stormy and Mrs. Lee met me at the\r\ncarriage, offering to excuse me from speaking to the five persons who\r\nwere in attendance. I felt not to disappoint those five, and presently\r\ntwenty-three were present, and we had a pleasant talk, after the reading\r\nof the short sermon.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 8_.... Felt much discouraged at waking, the long vista of work\r\nopening out before me, each task calling for some original brain-work, I\r\nmean for some special thought worth presenting to an audience. While I\r\npuzzled, a thought came to me for this day's suffrage speech: 'The\r\nkingdom cometh not with observation.' The silent, gradual, wonderful\r\ngrowth of public sentiment regarding woman suffrage, the spreading sense\r\nof the great universal harmony which Christ delivered to us in the words\r\nand acts of a few years, and which, it seems to me, is only now\r\nbeginning to make itself generally felt and to shape the world's\r\ncouncils increasingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 25._ I awoke this morning overwhelmed by the thought of my\r\nlecture at Salem, which I have not written. Suddenly a line of my own\r\ncame to me, 'Had I one of thy words, my Master,' and this brought me the\r\ntrain of thought, which I shall endeavor to present. The one word which\r\nwe all have is 'charity.' I wrote quite a screed and with that and some\r\nspeaking shall get through, I hope.... Got a good lead of thought and\r\nfelt that I could supply _extempore_ what I had not time to write. Harry\r\nand Fanny had a beautiful dinner for Lady Henry Somerset.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 26._ Lunch and lecture in Salem. A dreadful storm; I felt that\r\nI must go. The hackman and I rolled down the steps of the house, he,\r\nfortunately for me, undermost and quite stout of person; otherwise the\r\nshock would have been severe and even dangerous....\"\r\n\r\n[N.B. The terrified hackman, picking himself up, found her already on\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Mrs. Howe,\" he cried, \"let me help you into the house!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" was the reply. \"I have just time to catch my train!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To Maud_\r\n\r\n                            241 BEACON STREET, February 24, 1895.\r\n\r\nI lost a good lecture engagement at Poughkeepsie through a blizzard. Did\r\nnot start, finding that roads were badly blocked. My engagement at\r\nBrooklyn was a good one--a hundred dollars. I stayed at Chanler house,\r\nwhich was Chanleresque as usual. Peter Marié gave me a fine dinner.\r\nMargaret went with me, in white satin. I wore my black and white which\r\nyou remember well. It still looks well enough. I wore some beautiful\r\nlace which I got, through dear sister Annie, from some distressed lace\r\nwoman in England. I went to New York by a _five_-hour train, Godkin of\r\nthe \"Nation\" taking care of me. He remembers your kind attentions to him\r\nwhen you met him in the Pullman with a broken ankle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_March 30...._ I awoke very early this morning, with a head so confused\r\nthat I thought my brain had given out, at least from the recent\r\noverstrain.... Twice I knelt and prayed that God would give me the use\r\nof my mind. An hour in sleep did something towards this and a good cup\r\nof tea put me quite on my feet....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 8._ In the late afternoon Harry, my son, came, and after some\r\nlittle preparation told me of the death of my dear sister Annie. I have\r\nbeen toiling and moiling to keep the engagements of this week, but here\r\ncomes the great silence, and I must keep it for some days at least....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 10...._ It suddenly occurred to me that this might be the hour,\r\nas this would surely be the day of dear Annie's funeral. So I found the\r\n90th Psalm and the chapter in Corinthians, and sat and read them before\r\nher picture, remembering also Tennyson's lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"'And _Ave_, _Ave_, _Ave_ said\r\n  Adieu, adieu, forever more.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                               241 BEACON STREET, April 14, 1895.\r\n\r\nBUONA PASQUA, DEAR CHILD!--\r\n\r\n... I feel thankful that my darling died in her own home, apparently\r\nwithout suffering, and in the bosom of her beloved family. She has lived\r\nout her sweet life, and while the loss to all who loved her is great, we\r\nmust be willing to commit our dear ones to God, as we commit ourselves.\r\nThe chill of age, no doubt, prevents my feeling as I should once have\r\ndone, and the feeling that she has only passed in a little before me,\r\nlessens the sense of separation.\r\n\r\n12.25. I have been to our Easter service, which I found very comforting\r\nand elevating, though it brought some tears, of which I have not shed\r\nmany, being now past the age at which they flow freely. I thought a good\r\ndeal of the desolate Easter at the ranch. For them, too, let us hope\r\nthat the blessed season has brought comforting thoughts.... I went too\r\nto a Good Friday service at the new Old South, at which Dr. Donald of\r\nTrinity, Cuckson of Arlington [Unitarian] and Gordon, orthodox\r\n[Congregational], each took part. It was such an earnest, a reconciled\r\nand unified Christendom as I am thankful to have lived to see.\r\n\r\nLove and blessings to you and yours, dear child.\r\n\r\n                                                   Affect.,\r\n                                                          MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_May 20._.Have writ a brief letter to Mary G. Hennessey, Dixon,\r\nIllinois. She intends to speak of me in her graduation address and\r\nwanted me to send her 'a vivid history of my life,' with my 'ideas of\r\nliterary work.' I declined the first, but sent a bit under the last\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 27._... Suffrage meeting in the evening. I presided and began\r\nwith, 'Sixty years ago to-day I was sixteen years old. If I only knew\r\nnow what I thought I knew then'!\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 2._... To communion in afternoon. The minister asked whether I\r\nwould speak. I told what I had felt as I entered the church that\r\nafternoon, 'a sort of realization of the scene in that upper chamber,\r\nits gloom and its glory. What was in that great heart whose pulsations\r\nhave made themselves felt down to our own time, and all over the world?\r\nWhat are its sorrows? It bore the burthen of the sorrows and distresses\r\nof humanity, and we who pledge him here in this cup are bound to bear\r\nour part of that burthen. Only thus shall we attain to share in that\r\nfestival of joy and of revealed power which followed the days of doubt\r\nand despair.'\r\n\r\n\"All this came to me like a flash. I have written it down from memory\r\nbecause I value the thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 15._ Attended the funeral of my old friend and helper, Dr.\r\nWilliams, the oculist.... Six stalwart sons carried the coffin.... I\r\nthought this: 'I am glad that I have at last found out that the battle\r\nof life is an unending fight against the evil tendencies, evil mostly\r\nbecause exceeding right measure, which we find in ourselves.' Strange\r\nthat it should take so long to find this out. This is the victory which\r\nGod gives us when we have fought well and faithfully. Might I at least\r\nshare it with the saints whom I have known.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 14._... When I lay down to my rest before dinner, I had a\r\nmomentary sense of the sweetness and relief of the last lying down. This\r\nwas a new experience to me, as I have been averse to any thought of\r\ndeath as opposed to the activity which I love. I now saw it as the\r\ntermination of all fight and struggle, and prayed that in the life\r\nbeyond I might pay some of the debts of affection and recompense which I\r\nhave failed to make good in this life. Feeling a little like my old self\r\nto-day, I realize how far from well I have been for days past.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 27._ Woke with an aching head.... Prayed that even in suffering I\r\nmight still have 'work and worship.' Alliteration is, I know, one of my\r\nweaknesses. I thought afterwards of a third W--, work, worship, welcome.\r\nThese three words will do for a motto of the life which I now lead, in\r\nwhich these words stand for my ruling objects, 'welcome' denoting\r\n'hospitality' in which I should be glad to be more forward than I have\r\nbeen of late....\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 28._ Reading Mr. Hedge's review of Historic Christianity to-day,\r\nI felt puzzled by his showing of the usefulness of human errors and\r\ndelusion in the great order of Providence. Lying down for my midday\r\nrest, it became more clear to me that there is truth of sentiment and\r\nalso intellectual truth. In Dr. Hedge's view, the inevitable mistakes of\r\nhuman intellect in its early unfolding were helpful to the development\r\nof true sentiment. Higher than this, however, must be the agreement of\r\nthe two, prefigured perhaps in such sentences as 'Mercy and truth have\r\nkissed each other.' This thought also came to me: 'Oh, God, no kingdom\r\nis worth praying for but thine.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                        OAK GLEN, August 2, 1895.\r\n\r\nDEAREST PIDGE, ALSO MIDGE,--\r\n\r\n... I will condescend to inform you that I am well, that Flossy is very\r\nfaithful in taking care of me, and that we are reading Bulwer's\r\n\"Pelham,\" the stupidest of novels. We are two thirds through with it,\r\nand how the author of \"Rienzi\" could have offered the public so dull a\r\ndish, even in his unripe youth, passes my understanding.\r\n\r\nYou must not get too tired. Remember that no one will have mercy upon\r\nyou unless you will have mercy upon yourself.

She had forbidden me to see her off,\r\nbut I could not obey her in this and sat with her at breakfast, and had\r\na last kiss and greeting. My last words called after her were: 'Do not\r\nforget to say your prayers.' May God keep my dearest child and permit us\r\nto meet again, if it is best that I should live until her return, of\r\nwhich at present the prospect seems very good....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Association for the Advancement of Women met in New Orleans this\r\nyear, but first she must go with Florence to the Council of the General\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs at Atlanta, Georgia, where a great\r\nexposition was also being held. The expedition began with disaster.\r\n\r\n\"_October 31._ Left Boston by Colonial train at 9 A.M. Rolled down my\r\nfront steps, striking my forehead and bruising myself generally, in\r\ngetting to the carriage....\"\r\n\r\nAfter taking her part in the Council and visiting the Exposition, she\r\nproceeded to New Orleans, where a warm welcome awaited her. A few days\r\nafter her arrival, she was driving to some function when a trolley car\r\nran into the carriage, shaking her up badly and bruising her lame knee\r\nseverely. It seemed imperative that she should rest for a few days, and\r\nhostess and daughter pleaded with her. Florence begged in particular\r\nthat she would cancel her engagement to preach in the Unitarian Church;\r\nbegged a little too insistently. \"I _wouldn't_, dear mother!\" \"Flossy,\"\r\nwas the reply, \"you are you, and I am I!

I had a confused and weary time moving up from Newport, and my\r\nSouthern journey followed \"hard upon.\" Mrs. Cheney, Eva Channing, Mrs.\r\nBethune, and I started on October 31. Flossy joined us in New York. We\r\nreached Atlanta on Friday. Our meetings were held in the Woman's\r\nBuilding of the Atlanta Exposition, and were very pleasant, the\r\nExposition being also well worth visiting. I spoke in the Unitarian\r\nChurch on the Sunday following, and on November 4 we started for New\r\nOrleans which we reached the next morning. We were all to be\r\nentertained, and Mrs. King, our old friend, had written me a cordial\r\ninvitation to stay with her. The whole family turned out to receive us,\r\nand we were made at home at once.... Mrs. King had always been most kind\r\nand loyal to me. Our days in New Orleans, only six in number, were\r\ndelightful. I saw most of the old friends.... After the accident to Mrs.\r\nKing and myself, I felt much like seeking my own hearth. You will have\r\nseen or heard that a trolley car upset our carriage.... All said that it\r\nwas a wonderful escape. My bruises are nearly well now, and I am able to\r\ngo about as usual. New Orleans has improved much since we were there.\r\nThe old mule cars have disappeared, and much of the mud. People feel\r\nvery glad that the Lottery has been got rid of, but they are bitter\r\nagainst the sugar trust. Mrs. Walmsley received our A.A.W. ladies very\r\ncordially at her fine house and sent me beautiful flowers.... I spoke in\r\nthe Unitarian Church on Sunday, so I had my heart's desire fulfilled....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                       241 BEACON STREET, BOSTON,\r\n                                             December 18, 1895.\r\n\r\n'Pon my word and honor, couldn't come at it before!... Last week I spoke\r\nstraight along, every day until Saturday; was dreadfully tired. This\r\nweek haven't spoken at all. Oh, I forgot, lecture on \"Race Problems in\r\nEurope,\" before my own Club. Have sent the Armenians the money for a\r\nlecture given at Nahant last week, $10. Oh! the difficult dollars!...\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_December 28...._ Mrs. Barrows dined _tête-à-tête_ with me, and we had\r\nmuch talk about Armenia. I said: 'If we two should go to England, would\r\nit do any good?' I spoke only half in earnest. She said: 'If you would\r\nonly go, I would go with you as your henchman.' This set me thinking of\r\na voyage to England and a crusade such as I made for Peace in 1872. I\r\nam, however, held forcibly here by engagements, and at my age, my bodily\r\npresence might be, as St. Paul says, 'contemptible.'

The mince pie was in the grand style, and has been faithfully\r\ndevoured, a profound sense of duty forbidding me to neglect it.... I\r\nwent to a fine musical party at Mrs. Montie Sears's on Thursday evening,\r\n26th. Paderewski played, at first with strings a Septet or Septuor of\r\nBrahms', and then many things by himself. Somehow, I could not enjoy him\r\nmuch; he played miraculously, but did not seem to be _in it_.\r\n\r\nI am more than ever stirred up about the Armenians. The horrible\r\nmassacres go on, just the same, and Christendom stands still. Oh! a\r\ncurse on human selfishness!... We are to have a dramatic entertainment\r\nfor the Red Cross on Jan. 7th at Boston Theatre....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_December 29...._ I determined to-day to try to work more\r\nsystematically for the Armenians. Think I will write to Clara Barton and\r\nSenator Hoar, also to Lady Henry Somerset, an arraignment of Christendom\r\nfor its supineness towards the Turks, an allusion to Coeur de Lion and\r\nthe ancient Crusaders....\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 30...._ Clara Barton held a meeting for the Red Cross.... I\r\nwas the last speaker and I think that, as sometimes happens, my few\r\nwords brought things to a crisis, for the moment only, indeed, but even\r\nthat may help.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 31._ Rising early and with a mind somewhat confused and\r\nclouded, I went to my window. As I looked out, the gray clouds parted,\r\ngiving me a moment's sight of a star high up in the heavens. This little\r\nglimpse gave me hope for the day and great comfort. It was like an\r\nanswering glance to my many troubled questions....\"\r\n\r\n\"We have stood for that which was known to be right in theory, and for\r\nthat which has proved to be right in practice. (From my suffrage address\r\nat State House in 1894).\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December, 1895, appeared her first volume since \"Margaret Fuller,\" a\r\ncollection of essays, published under the title of the opening one, \"Is\r\nPolite Society Polite?\" In the preface she says:--\r\n\r\n\"I remember, that quite late in the fifties, I mentioned to Theodore\r\nParker the desire which I began to feel to give living expression to my\r\nthoughts, and to lend to my written words the interpretation of my\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Parker, who had taken a friendly interest in the publication of my\r\nfirst volumes, 'Passion Flowers' and 'Words for the Hour,' gave his\r\napproval also to this new project. 'The great desire of the age,' he\r\nsaid, 'is for vocal expression. People are scarcely satisfied with the\r\nprinted page alone: they crave for their instruction the living voice\r\nand the living presence.'...\"\r\n\r\nOf the title essay she says:--\r\n\r\n\"I remember that I was once invited to read this essay to a village\r\naudience in one of the New England States. My theme was probably one\r\nquite remote from the general thought of my hearers. As I went on,\r\ntheir indifference began to affect me, and my thought was that I might\r\nas well have appealed to a set of wooden tenpins as to those who were\r\npresent on that occasion.\r\n\r\n\"In this, I afterwards learned that I was mistaken. After the conclusion\r\nof the evening's exercise, a young man, well known in the community, was\r\nheard to inquire urgently where he could find the lecturer. Friends\r\nasked, what did he want of her? He replied: 'Well, I did put my brother\r\nin the poorhouse, and now that I have heard Mrs. Howe, I suppose that I\r\nmust take him out.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother personal reminiscence goes back to her childhood days:--\r\n\r\n\"I had a nursery governess when I was a small child. She came from some\r\ncountry town, and probably regarded her position in my father's family\r\nas a promotion. One evening, while we little folks gathered about her in\r\nour nursery, she wept bitterly. 'What is the matter?' we asked; and she\r\ntook me up in her lap, and said: 'My poor old father came here to see me\r\nto-day, and I would not see him. I bade them tell him that he had\r\nmistaken the house, and he went away, and as he went I saw him looking\r\nup at the windows so wistfully!' Poor woman! We wept with her, feeling\r\nthat this was indeed a tragical event, and not knowing what she could do\r\nto make it better.\r\n\r\n\"But could I see that woman now, I would say to her: 'If you were\r\nserving the king at his table, and held his wine-cup in your hand, and\r\nyour father stood without, asking for you, you should set down the cup,\r\nand go out from the royal presence to honor your father, so much the\r\nmore if he is poor, so much the more if he is old.' And all that is\r\nreally polite in polite society would say so too.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same page is a memory of later years:--\r\n\r\n\"I once heard a lady, herself quite new in society, say of a Parisian\r\ndame who had shown her some attention: 'Ah! the trouble with Madame ----\r\nis that she is too good-natured. She entertains everybody.' 'Indeed,'\r\nthought I, 'if she had been less good-natured, is it certain that she\r\nwould have entertained you?'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF LABOR\r\n\r\n1896-1897; _aet._ 77-78\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REST\r\n\r\n  I will build a house of rest,\r\n  Square the corners every one:\r\n  At each angle on his breast\r\n  Shall a cherub take the sun;\r\n  Rising, risen, sinking, down,\r\n  Weaving day's unequal crown.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  With a free, unmeasured tread\r\n  Shall we pace the cloisters through:\r\n  Rest, enfranchised, like the Dead;\r\n  Rest till Love be born anew.\r\n  Weary Thought shall take his time,\r\n  Free of task-work, loosed from rhyme.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Measured bread shall build us up\r\n  At the hospitable board;\r\n  In Contentment's golden cup\r\n  Is the guileless liquor poured.\r\n  May the beggar pledge the king\r\n  In that spirit gathering.\r\n\r\n  Oh!

Elizabeth [Mrs. John Jay Chapman] had sent\r\nmaid and carriage for me, which was most kind. Had a good rest and a\r\nshort walk and went to Sorosis dinner, which was very brilliant and\r\nfine. I was asked to speak and took for my topic, 'The Day of Small\r\nThings'; the beginning of Sorosis and the New England Woman's Club,\r\nconsidered so trifling a matter, yet very important because it had\r\nbehind it a very important principle; the fact that the time had come in\r\nwhich women were bound to study, assist, and stand by each other. I\r\nquoted Christ's saying about the mustard seed. Miss Barton's mission to\r\nArmenia I called a mustard seed, and one which would have very important\r\nresults.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 27...._ Wrote a few lines to Mrs. Charles A. Babcock, Oil\r\nCity, Pennsylvania, for a woman's issue of a paper called the 'Derrick.'\r\nShe wishes me to say what I thought would be the result of the 'women's\r\nedition' fad. I said that one result would be to drive to desperation\r\nthose who receive letters, asking contributions to these issues.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 9._ Another inspired sermon from C. G. Ames.

The angel has certainly\r\ntroubled the pool and we can go to it for healing.' Returning home, I\r\nwrote some lines about my sister Annie's picture. I had in church a\r\nmomentary glimpse of the meaning of Christ's saying, 'I am the vine and\r\nye are the branches.' I felt how the source of our spiritual love is in\r\nthe heavenly fatherhood, and how departing from our sense of this we\r\nbecome empty and barren. It was a moment of great comfort....\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 10...._ Gulesian last evening said that the Armenians want me\r\nto go to England, as a leader in advocacy of their cause. The thought\r\nbrought me a new feeling of energy and enthusiasm. I think I must first\r\nhelp the cause in Washington, D.C.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 26._ Hearing at State House on Suffrage. Worked at it [her\r\naddress] somewhat in the early morning. Was tolerably successful in\r\nmaking my points. Was rather disappointed because no one applauded me.\r\nConsidered that this was a lesson that we must learn, to do without\r\npraise. It comforted me to take it in this way. Soon the interest of\r\nwhat the others said put my own matters quite out of my mind. The\r\nhearing was a good one, all except a dreadful woman, calling herself a\r\nSocialist, full of insufferable conceit and affectation of knowledge. An\r\nEnglish labor man spoke well.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 22...._ As I left church, Mrs. James Freeman Clarke stopped me,\r\ntook both of my hands in hers and said she was sure that the world was\r\nbetter for my having been in it. This from so undemonstrative a person\r\nmoved me a good deal and consoled me somewhat for my poor deserts and\r\nperformances in the past--a burden which often weighs heavily upon\r\nme....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 2._ Conservatory of Music, 3 P.M. I went in fear and trembling\r\nwith a violent bronchial cold and cough, in a miserable storm. I prayed\r\nall the way there that I might be pleasant in my demeanor, and I think\r\nthat I was, for my trouble at having to run such a risk soon went out of\r\nmy mind, and I enjoyed the occasion very much; especially meeting pupils\r\nfrom so many distant States, and one or two from Canada.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 8...._ I asked in my prayer this morning, feeling miserably dull\r\nand weak, that some deed of help and love might be given me to\r\naccomplish to-day. At noon came three gentlemen, Hagop Bogigian, Mr.\r\nBlanchard, and Mr. Breed, of Lynn, praying me to make an appeal to the\r\nwomen of America for their Armenian sisters, who are destroying\r\nthemselves in many instances to avoid Turkish outrage. The funds\r\nsubscribed for relief are exhausted and some new stimulus to rouse the\r\npublic is much needed....

Let me tell you now, lest you should hear of it in some other way,\r\nthat I was urged to go to England this summer to intercede with Queen\r\nVictoria for the Armenians. I thought of it, but the plan seemed to me\r\nchimerical and futile. I still have them and the Cretans greatly at\r\nheart, but I don't think I could do any good in the way just mentioned.\r\nI should have been glad to make a great sacrifice for these persecuted\r\npeople, but common sense must be adhered to, in all circumstances....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _To the same_\r\n\r\n                               241 BEACON STREET, April 18, 1896.\r\n\r\n... If you go to Russia, be careful to go as Mrs. John Elliott, not as\r\nMaud Howe Elliott. Your name is probably known there as one of the\r\nfriends of \"Free Russia,\" and you might be subjected to some annoyance\r\nin consequence. You had better make acquaintance with our minister,\r\nwhoever he may be. The Russians seem now to have joined hands with the\r\nTurks. If the American missionaries can only be got rid of, Russia, it\r\nis said, will take Armenia under her so-called protection, and will\r\ncompel all Christians to join the Greek Church. There is so much spying\r\nin Russia that you will have to be very careful what you talk about. I\r\nrather hope you will not go, for a dynamite country is especially\r\ndangerous in times of great public excitement, which the time of the\r\ncoronation cannot fail to be....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_April 20._ F.

During\r\nthe Roman winter, soon to be described, she wrote steadily day by day;\r\nbut here she must still work at disadvantage, having no access to\r\njournals or papers, depending on memory alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_May 7._ Question: Cannot we follow up the Parliament of Religions by a\r\nPan-Christian Association?

I had barely unpacked my books and papers when Daisy came out\r\non horseback to insist upon my paying her a visit. I did this, and went\r\nto her on Wednesday, returning home on the following Monday. On the 4th\r\nof July I attended, by invitation, the meeting of the Cincinnati in the\r\nOld State House here. Cousin Nathanael Greene presided. Charles Howland\r\nRussell read aloud the Declaration of Independence. Governor Lippitt\r\nmade an address in which he mentioned Governor Samuel Ward, my\r\ngreat-grandfather.... I have a good piano this year. We went on Monday\r\nlast to see the furniture at Malbone, all of which has just been sold at\r\nauction. A good deal of it was very costly and some of it very\r\nhandsome.... Apropos of worldly goods, Cornelius Vanderbilt has had a\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                         OAK GLEN, July 25, 1896.\r\n\r\nOh, yes! you now and then do lend me a daughter, and so you'd ought to.\r\nWhich, didn't I profit by Alice's visit? My good woman (as poor, dear\r\n----used to say when she was in wrath), I should think so. Clear comfort\r\nthe wretch was to me, wretch because she had such an old miserable to\r\nlook after. I sometimes catch myself thinking that, however it may be\r\nwith other families, your family, madam, came into this world for my\r\nespecial pleasure and comfort. What do you think of this view? No matter\r\nwhat you think, dear, it won't make any difference as to facts.... I\r\nmiss even the youth in Alice's voice. I would like, mum, if you please,\r\nmum, to enjoy about sixty years more of grandmotherhood, with fresh\r\ncrops of grandchildren coming up at reasonable intervals. Our life here,\r\nthis summer, is even unusually quiet. We have few visitors.... I am, as\r\nusual, well content with my books, and busy with my papers. Flossy reads\r\naloud Green's \"History of the English People\" about half an hour daily,\r\nafter breakfast. The boys reluctantly submit to listen, fidgeting a\r\ngood deal. It is less readable for youth than I supposed it to be. We\r\nplay whist in the evening, and had a wood fire last evening, the weather\r\nbeing suddenly cold. I learned yesterday, from the \"'Tiser,\" the death\r\nof Adolphe Mailliard [her brother-in-law] which has brought me many\r\nsober thoughts, despite the trifling tone of this letter. I had waked\r\nthe day before, thinking that some one said to me \"Mailliard is dying.\"\r\nI recorded it in my Diary, but had no idea that I should so soon hear of\r\nit as a reality.

Savage's 'Four Great Questions,' and\r\nin the long biography of my uncle, Rev. B. C. Cutler. His piety and\r\nfaithfulness appear to me most edifying. His theology at the present\r\ntime seems impossible. I am sorry that I saw so very little of him after\r\nmy marriage, but he was disposed to consider me as one of the lost, and\r\nI could not have met him on any religious ground. I could do this better\r\nnow, having learned something of the value which very erroneous opinions\r\nmay have, when they serve, as in his case, to stimulate right effort and\r\ntrue feeling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                       OAK GLEN, August 21, 1896.\r\n\r\nBeing in a spleeny and uncomfortable mood to-day, what resource so\r\nlegitimate as to betake myself to my own family? No particular reason\r\nfor growling, growly so much the more. If I only had a good grievance\r\nnow, how I would improve it! Well, you see, trouble is some of us have\r\nnot any money to speak of, and in consequence we ain't nobody, and so\r\non. There I hear the voice of my little mother Laura, saying: \"Well,\r\nwell!\" in her soothing way. The truth is, darling, that first I was\r\nroasted out, and then it \"friz horrid,\" and my poor old \"conshushion\"\r\ncouldn't quite stand it.... D' ye see? \"Well, no,\" says Laura: \"I don't\r\nexactly see.\" Well, s'pose you don't--what then? You sweetheart, this is\r\njust the way this old, unthankful sinner was taken, just now.

I prayed quite\r\nearnestly this morning that the dimness of sight, which has lately\r\ntroubled me, might disappear. My eyes are really better to-day. I seemed\r\nat one moment during the service to see myself as a little child in the\r\nHeavenly Father's Nursery, having played my naughty pranks (alas!) and\r\nleft my tasks unperformed, but coming, as bedtime draws near, to kiss\r\nand be forgiven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To Maud_\r\n\r\n                      ROKEBY, BARRYTOWN, N.Y., December 25, 1896.\r\n\r\nMY OWN DEAREST,--\r\n\r\nI am here according to promise to spend Christmas with Daisy.[119] I\r\noccupy Elizabeth Chanler's room, beautifully adorned with hangings of\r\npoppy-colored silk.\r\n\r\n  [119] Mrs. Winthrop Chanler.\r\n\r\n...

After dinner, we had a fiddler in the hall.\r\nAlida danced an Irish jig very prettily, and we had a Virginia reel,\r\nwhich I danced, if you please, with Mr. Bostwick. Then we snuggled up to\r\nthe fire in the library and Wintie read aloud from Mark Twain's\r\n\"Huckleberry Finn.\"...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1897 brought new activities. The Lodge Immigration Bill roused\r\nher to indignation and protest; there were \"screeds\" and letters to the\r\npowers that were.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring came another crisis in the East, Greece and Crete\r\nbearing this time the brunt of Turkish violence. Thirty years had passed\r\nsince Crete made her first stand for independence; years of dumb\r\nsuffering and misery. Now her people rose again in revolt against their\r\nbrutal masters, and this time Greece felt strong enough to stand openly\r\nby her Cretan brothers.\r\n\r\nOur mother was deeply moved by this new need, which recalled so many\r\nprecious memories. The record of the spring of 1897 is much concerned\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nWritten on the fly-leaf of the Journal: \"The good God make me grateful\r\nfor this new year, of which I am allowed to see the beginning.

It is certainly very narrowing both to\r\nthe mind and to the affections, and is therefore to be avoided.

Mrs. Berdan made a visit here, and I gave a reception for her, and\r\ntook her to the great occasion of the Saturday Morning Club, celebrating\r\ntheir twenty-fifth anniversary. The whole thing was very beautiful--the\r\nreception was in the tapestry room of the Art Museum. I was placed in a\r\nsort of throne chair, with the president and ex-presidents in a line at\r\nmy left, and the cream of Boston was all brought up and presented to me.\r\nIn another of the large rooms a stage had been arranged, and from this I\r\nmade my little speech. Then came some beautiful singing by Mrs. Tebbets,\r\nwith a small orchestral accompaniment, and then was given one act of\r\nTennyson's \"Princess\" and Browning's \"In a Balcony.\" The place, the\r\nperformances, and the guests made this a very distinguished occasion. I\r\nhad gone just before this to see Louisa Cushing's wonderful acting in a\r\nFrench play of the Commune. She possesses great tragic power and reminds\r\none of Duse and of Sarah Bernhardt. I suppose that H. M. H. has written\r\nyou of his appointment as Professor of Metallurgy, etc., at Columbia\r\nCollege, New York. He and Fannie are much pleased with this, and it is\r\nconsidered a very important step for him. I shall miss him a good deal,\r\nbut am glad of it for his sake. Michael[120] and I went yesterday to the\r\nannual breakfast of the Charity Club. Greece had been made the topic of\r\nthe day. Michael made a splendid speech, and sang three stanzas of the\r\nGreek National Hymn, albeit he cannot sing at all--he intoned it. I also\r\nmade a little speech, and some money was given to aid the Greek cause.\r\nHezekiah Butterworth was present, and I offered the following conundrum:\r\n\"What's butter worth?\" Answer, \"The cream of everything.\" Adieu, my\r\ndearest.\r\n\r\n  [120] Anagnos.\r\n\r\n                                 Ever your loving\r\n                                                          MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_April 26._ Received permission to use Faneuil Hall for a Woman's\r\nMeeting of Aid and Sympathy for Greece....\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 3._ Working at sending out notices of the Faneuil Hall meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 4._ The day was auspicious for our meeting. Although very tired\r\nwith the preparations, I wrote my little screed, dressed, and went\r\nbetimes to the Hall, where I was expected to preside. I found it\r\nprettily arranged, though at very small expense. I wore as a badge a\r\ntiny Greek flag made of blue and white ribbon, and brought badges of\r\nthese colors for the young ladies who were to take up the collection.\r\nMany whom I had requested to come were present. Sarah Whitman, Lizzie\r\nAgassiz, Mrs. Cornelius Felton, Mrs. Fields, Mrs. Whitney, besides our\r\nCommittee and Mrs. Barrows. M. Anagnos gave us the band of the\r\nInstitution, which was a great help. They played several times. I\r\nintroduced C. G. Ames, who made a prayer. My opening address followed.\r\nMmes. Livermore and Woolson, and Anagnos made the most important\r\naddresses. As the band played 'America,' a young Greek came in, bearing\r\nthe Greek flag, which had quite a dramatic effect. The meeting was\r\nenthusiastic and the contribution unusual for such a meeting, three\r\nhundred and ninety-seven dollars and odd cents. Thank God for this\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 13....

The old religions are generally considered\r\nto-day as necessary steps in the religion of the human race, and\r\ntherefore as part of the plan of a beneficent Providence. The Jews were\r\npeople of especial religious genius, producing a wonderful religious\r\nliterature, and Christianity, which came out of Judaism, is, to my\r\nbelief, the culmination of the religious sense of mankind. But Paul\r\nhimself says, speaking to the Athenians, that \"God hath not left himself\r\nwithout a witness,\" at any time. I was brought up, of course, in the\r\nold belief, which I soon dismissed as irreconcilable with any idea of a\r\nbeneficent Deity. As for the doctrine of regeneration, I think that by\r\nbeing born again the dear Lord meant that we cannot apprehend spiritual\r\ntruths unless our minds are earnestly set upon understanding them. To\r\nany one who has led a simple, material life, without aspiration or moral\r\nreflection, the change by which his attention becomes fastened upon the\r\nnobler aspect of character and of life is really like a new birth. We\r\nmay say the same of the love of high art and great literature. Some\r\npeople turn very suddenly from a frivolous or immoral life to a better\r\nand more thoughtful way. They remember this as a sudden conversion. In\r\nmost of us, I think the change is more gradual and natural. The better\r\ninfluences win us from the evil things to which most of us are in some\r\nway disposed. We have to seek the one and to shun the other. I, for\r\nexample, am very thankful that my views of many things are unlike what\r\nthey were twenty or thirty or forty years ago. I attribute this change\r\nmostly to good influences, reading, hearing sermons and high\r\nconversation. These things often begin in an effort of will to \"move up\r\nhigher.\" If I write more about this, I shall muddle myself and you. Only\r\ndon't distress yourself about regeneration. I think it mostly comes\r\ninsensibly, like a child's growth....\r\n\r\nI attended the memorial meeting at the unveiling of the Shaw Monument.\r\nYou can't think how beautiful the work is. The ceremonies took place\r\nMonday, beginning with a procession which came through Beacon Street.\r\nGovernor Wolcott, in a barouche and four, distinctly bowed to me. The\r\nNew York Seventh Regiment came on and marched beautifully; our Cadets\r\nmarched about as well. There was also a squad from our battleships, two\r\nof which were in the harbor. At twelve o'clock we all went to Music Hall\r\nwhere they sang my \"Battle Hymn.\" The Governor and Mayor and Colonel\r\nHarry Lee spoke. Willie James gave the oration and Booker Washington\r\nreally made _the_ address of the day, simple, balanced, and very\r\neloquent. I had a visit yesterday from Larz and Isabel [Anderson]. He\r\ntold me much about you. Darling, this is a very poor letter, but much\r\nlove goes with it.\r\n\r\n                              Affectionate\r\n                                                          MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_June 6._... Have writ a note to little John Jeffries, _aet._ six\r\nyears, who sent me a note in his own writing, with a dollar saved out of\r\nfive cents per week, for the 'poor Armenians.' He writes: 'I don't like\r\nthe Turks one bit. I think they are horrid.' Have sent note and dollar\r\nto A. S. B. for the Armenian orphans.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 27, Oak Glen._ My first writing in this dear place. Carrie Hall\r\nyesterday moved me down into dear Chev's bedroom on the first floor,\r\nWesselhoeft having forbidden me to go up and down stairs. I rebelled\r\ninwardly against this, but am compelled to acknowledge that it is best\r\nso. Carrie showed great energy in moving down all the small objects to\r\nwhich she supposed me to be attached. I have now had an exquisite\r\nsitting in my green parlor, reading a sermon of dear James Freeman\r\nClarke's.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 28._ Wrote my stint of 'Reminiscences' in the morning.... At\r\nbedtime had very sober thoughts of the limitation of life. It seemed to\r\nme that the end might be near. My lameness and the painful condition of\r\nmy feet appear like warnings of a decline of physical power, which could\r\nonly lead one way. My great anxiety is to see Maud before I depart.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 10._ I dreamed last night, or rather this morning, that I was\r\nwalking as of old, lightly and without pain. I cried in my joy: 'Oh,\r\nsome one has been mind-curing me. My lameness has disappeared.' Have\r\nwrit a pretty good screed about John Brown.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 22._... Dearest Maud and Jack arrived in the evening. So welcome!\r\nI had not seen Jack in two years. I had begun to fear that I was never\r\nto see Maud again.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 26._ Had a little time of quiet thought this morning, in which I\r\nseemed to see how the intensity of individual desire would make chaos in\r\nthe world of men and women if there were not a conquering and\r\nreconciling principle of harmony above them all. This to my mind can be\r\nno other than the infinite wisdom and infinite love which we call God.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 18._ I prayed this morning for some direct and definite service\r\nwhich I might render. At noon a reporter from the 'New York Journal'\r\narrived, beseeching me to write something to help the young Cuban girl,\r\nwho is in danger of being sent to the Spanish Penal Colony [Ceuta] in\r\nAfrica. I wrote an appeal in her behalf and suggested a cable to the\r\nPope. This I have already written. The Hearsts will send it. This was\r\nan answer to my prayer. Our dear H. M. H. arrived at 3 P.M....\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 29._ Had a little service for my own people, Flossy and her\r\nfour children. Spoke of the importance of religious culture. Read the\r\nparable of the wise and foolish virgins. Flossy thought the wise ones\r\nunkind not to be willing to share with the foolish. I suggested that the\r\noil pictured something which could not be given in a minute. Cited\r\nBeecher's saying, which I have so long remembered, that we cannot get\r\nreligion as we order a suit of clothes. If we live without it, when some\r\noverwhelming distress or temptation meets us, we shall not find either\r\nthe consolation or the strength which true faith gives.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 23._ Have just learned by cable from Rome that my dearest\r\nsister Louisa died yesterday morning. Let me rather hope that she awoke\r\nfrom painful weakness and infirmity into a new glory of spiritual life.\r\nHer life here has been most blameless, as well as most beautiful.\r\nTransplanted to Rome in her early youth and beauty, she became there a\r\ncentre of disinterested hospitality, of love and of charity. She was as\r\nrare a person in her way as my sweet sister Annie. Alas! I, of less\r\ndesert than either, am left, the last of my dear father's and mother's\r\nchildren. God grant that my remaining may be for good! And God help me\r\nto use faithfully my little remnant of life in setting my house in\r\norder, and in giving such completeness as I can to my life-work, or\r\nrather, to its poor efforts.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 25._ Was sad as death at waking, pondering my many\r\ndifficulties. The day is most lovely. I have read two of Dr. Hedge's\r\nsermons and feel much better. One is called 'The Comforter,' and was\r\nprobably written in view of the loss of friends by death. It speaks of\r\nthe spirit of a true life, which does not pass away when the life is\r\nended, but becomes more and more dear and precious to loving survivors.\r\nThe text, from John xvi, 7: 'It is expedient for you that I go away.'\r\nHave writ a good screed about the Rome of 1843-44.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                    OAK GLEN, September 27, 1897.\r\n\r\n... My dear sister and I have lived so long far apart, that it is\r\ndifficult for me to have a _realizing sense_ of her departure. It is\r\nonly at moments that I can feel that we shall meet on earth no more. I\r\ngrieve most of all that my life has been so far removed from hers. She\r\nhas been a joy, a comfort, a delight to so many people, and I have had\r\nso little of all this! The remembrance of what I have had is indeed most\r\nprecious, but alas! for the long and wide separation. What an enviable\r\nmemory she leaves! No shadows to dim its beauty.\r\n\r\nI send you, dear, a statement regarding my relations with Lee and\r\nShepard. I am much disheartened about my poems and almost feel like\r\ngiving up. _But I won't._\r\n\r\n                                  Affect.,\r\n                                                          MOTHER.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1897, she sailed for Italy with the Elliotts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE LAST ROMAN WINTER\r\n\r\n1897-1898; _aet._ 78\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF MY LOVE\r\n\r\n  She sits among th' eternal hills,\r\n  Their crown, thrice glorious and dear;\r\n  Her voice is as a thousand tongues\r\n  Of silver fountains, gurgling clear.\r\n\r\n  Her breath is prayer, her life is love,\r\n  And worship of all lovely things;\r\n  Her children have a gracious port,\r\n  Her beggars show the blood of kings.\r\n\r\n  By old Tradition guarded close,\r\n  None doubt the grandeur she has seen;\r\n  Upon her venerable front\r\n  Is written: \"I was born a Queen!\"\r\n\r\n  She rules the age by Beauty's power,\r\n  As once she ruled by armèd might;\r\n  The Southern sun doth treasure her\r\n  Deep in his golden heart of light.\r\n\r\n  Awe strikes the traveller when he sees\r\n  The vision of her distant dome,\r\n  And a strange spasm wrings his heart\r\n  As the guide whispers: \"There is Rome!\"\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  And, though it seem a childish prayer,\r\n  I've breathed it oft, that when I die,\r\n  As thy remembrance dear in it,\r\n  That heart in thee might buried lie.\r\n\r\n                                             J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing verse of her early poem, \"The City of My Love,\" expresses\r\nthe longing that, like Shelley's, her heart \"might buried lie\" in Rome.\r\nSome memory of this wish, some foreboding that the wish might be\r\ngranted, possibly darkened the first days of her last Roman winter. In\r\nlate November of the year 1897 she arrived in Rome with the Elliotts to\r\npass the winter at their apartment in the ancient Palazzo Rusticucci of\r\nthe old Leonine City across the Tiber; in the shadow of St. Peter's,\r\nnext door to the Vatican. The visit had been planned partly in the hope\r\nthat she might once more see her sister Louisa. In this we know she was\r\ndisappointed. They reached Rome at the beginning of the rainy season,\r\nwhich fell late that year. All these causes taken together account for\r\nan unfamiliar depression that creeps into the Journal. She missed, too,\r\nthe thousand interests of her Boston life; her church, her club, her\r\nmeetings, all the happy business of keeping a grandmother's house where\r\nthree generations and their friends were made welcome. At home every\r\nhour of time was planned for, every ounce of power well invested in some\r\n\"labor worthy of her metal.\" In Rome her only work at first was the\r\nwriting of her \"Reminiscences\" for the \"Atlantic Monthly.\" Happily, the\r\ndepression was short-lived. Gradually the ancient spell of the Great\r\nEnchantress once more enthralled her, but it was not until she had\r\nfounded a club, helped to found a Woman's Council, begun to receive\r\ninvitations to lecture and to preach, that the accustomed _joie de\r\nvivre_ pulses through the record. The sower is at work again, the ground\r\nis fertile, the seed quickening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_December 1._ The first day of this winter, which God help me to live\r\nthrough! Dearest Maud is all kindness and devotion to me, and so is\r\nJack, but I have Rome _en grippe_; nothing in it pleases me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 6._ Something, perhaps it is the bright weather, moves me to\r\nactivity so strongly that I hasten to take up my pen, hoping not to\r\nlapse into the mood of passive depression which has possessed me ever\r\nsince my arrival in Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 7._ We visited the [William J.] Stillmans--S. and I had not\r\nmet in thirty years, not since '67 in Athens. Went to afternoon tea at\r\nMiss Leigh Smith's. She is a cousin of Florence Nightingale, whom she\r\nresembles in appearance. Mme. Helbig was there, overflowing as ever with\r\ngeniality and kindness.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Stillman was then the Roman correspondent of the London \"Times,\" a\r\nposition only second in importance to that of the British Ambassador.\r\nHis tall, lean figure, stooping shoulders,--where a pet squirrel often\r\nperched,--his long grey beard and keen eyes were familiar to the Romans\r\nof that day. His house was a meeting-place for artists and _litterati_.\r\nMrs. Stillman our mother had formerly known as the beautiful Marie\r\nSpartali, the friend of Rossetti and Du Maurier, the idol of literary\r\nand artistic London. A warm friendship grew up between them. Together\r\nthey frequented the antiquaries, gleaning small treasures of ancient\r\nlace and peasant jewels.\r\n\r\n\"I bought this by the Muse Stillman's advice\": this explanation\r\nguaranteed the wisdom of purchasing the small rose diamond ring set in\r\nblack enamel.\r\n\r\n\"_December 9._ Dined with Daisy Chanler. We met there one Brewster and\r\nHendrik Anderson. After dinner came Palmer [son of Courtland] and his\r\nsister. He is a pianist of real power and charm--made me think of\r\nPaderewski, when I first heard him....\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 10._ Drove past the Trevi Fountain and to the Coliseum, where\r\nwe walked awhile. Ladies came to hear me talk about Women's Clubs. This\r\ntalk, which I had rather dreaded to give, passed off pleasantly.... Most\r\nof the ladies present expressed the desire to have a small and select\r\nclub of women in Rome. Maud volunteered to make the first effort, with\r\nMme. DesGrange and Jessie Cochrane to help her.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 12._ Bessie Crawford brought her children to see me. Very\r\nfine little creatures, the eldest boy[122] handsome, dark like his\r\nmother, the others blond and a good deal like Marion in his early life.\"\r\n\r\n  [122] Harold Crawford, who was killed in the present war (1915),\r\n  fighting for the Allies.\r\n\r\n\"_December 14._ In the afternoon drove with Jack to visit Villegas.\r\nFound a splendid house with absolutely no fire--the cold of the studio\r\nwas tomb-like. A fire was lighted in a stove and cakes were served, with\r\nsome excellent Amontillado wine, which I think saved my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 18._ When I lay down to take my nap before dinner, I had a\r\nsudden thought-vision of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. I\r\nseemed to see how the human could in a way reflect the glory of the\r\ndivine, giving not a mechanical, but an affectional and spiritual\r\nre-showing of the great unfathomable glory. I need not say that I had no\r\nsleep--I wish the glimpse then given me might remain in my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 21._ Feeling much better in health, I determined to take up\r\nmy 'Reminiscences' again. Mme. Rose passed the evening with me. She told\r\nme that Pio Nono had endorsed the Rosminian philosophy, which had had\r\nquite a following in the Church, Cardinal Hohenlohe having been very\r\nprominent in this. When Leo XIII was elected, the Jesuits came to him\r\nand promised that he should have a Jubilee if he would take part against\r\nthe Rosminian ideas, and put the books on the Index Expurgatorius, the\r\nwhich he promptly did. Hohenlohe is supposed to have been the real hero\r\nof the poisoning described in Zola's 'Rome'--his servant died after\r\nhaving eaten of something which had been sent from the Vatican.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 25._ Blessed Christmas Day! Maud and I went to St. Peter's to\r\nget, as she said, a whiff of the mass. We did not profit much by this,\r\nbut met Edward Jackson, of Boston, and Monsignor Stanley, whom I had not\r\nseen in many years. We had a pleasant foregathering with him.\r\n\r\n\"In St. Peter's my mind became impressed with the immense intellectual\r\nforce pledged to the upbuilding and upholding of the Church of Rome. As\r\nthis thought almost overpowered me, I remembered our dear Christ\r\nvisiting the superb temple at Jerusalem and foretelling its destruction\r\nand the indestructibility of his own doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nOn fair days she took her walk on the terrace, feasting her eyes on the\r\nsplendid view. In the distance the Alban and the Sabine Hills, Mount\r\nSoracte and the Leonessa; close at hand the Tiber, Rome's towers and\r\ndomes, St. Peter's with the colonnade, the Piazza, and the sparkling\r\nfountains. She delighted in the flowers of the terrace, which she called\r\nher \"hanging garden\"; she had her own little watering-pot, and\r\nfaithfully tended the white rose which she claimed as her special\r\ncharge. From the terrace she looked across to the windows of the Pope's\r\nprivate apartment. Opposed as she was to the Pontiff's policy, she still\r\nfelt a sympathy with the old man, whose splendid prison she often passed\r\non her way to St. Peter's, where in bad weather she always took her\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n\"_December 31._ I am sorry to take leave of this year, which has given\r\nme many good things, some blessings in disguise, as my lameness proved,\r\ncompelling me to pass many quiet days, good for study and for my\r\n'Reminiscences,' which I only began in earnest after Wesselhoeft\r\ncondemned me to remain on one floor for a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 3, 1898._ I feel that my 'Reminiscences' will be disappointing\r\nto the world in general, if it ever troubles itself to read them,--I\r\nfeel quite sure that it has neglected some good writing of mine, in\r\nverse and in prose. I cannot help anticipating for this book the same\r\nneglect, and this discourages me somewhat.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon drove to Monte Janiculo and saw the wonderful view of\r\nRome, and the equestrian statue of Garibaldi crowning the height. We\r\nalso drove through the Villa Pamfili Doria, which is very beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 6._ To visit Countess Catucci at Villino Catucci. She was a\r\nMiss Mary Stearns, of Springfield, Massachusetts. Her husband has been\r\nan officer of the King's bersaglieri. Before the unification of Italy,\r\nhe was sent to Perugia to reclaim deserters from among the recruits for\r\nthe Italian army. Cardinal Pecci was then living near Perugia. Count\r\nCatucci called to assure him with great politeness that he would take\r\nhis word and not search his premises. The Cardinal treated him with\r\nequal politeness, but declined to continue the acquaintance after his\r\nremoval to Rome, when he became Pope in 1878.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 12._ The first meeting of our little circle--at Miss Leigh\r\nSmith's, 17 Trinità dei Monti. I presided and introduced Richard Norton,\r\nwho gave an interesting account of the American School of Archæology at\r\nAthens, and of the excavations at Athens.... Anderson to dine. He took a\r\npaper outline of my profile, wishing to model a bust of me.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Winthrop Chanlers were passing the winter in Rome; this added much\r\nto her pleasure. The depression gradually disappeared, and she found\r\nherself once more at home there. She met many people who interested her:\r\nHall Caine, Björnstjerne Björnson, many artists too. Don José Villegas,\r\nthe great Spanish painter (now Director of the Prado Museum at Madrid),\r\nwho was living in his famous Moorish villa on the Monte Parioli, made a\r\nbrilliant, realistic portrait of her, and Hendrik Anderson, the\r\nNorwegian-American sculptor, modelled an interesting terra-cotta bust.\r\nWhile the sittings for these portraits were going on, her niece said to\r\nher:--\r\n\r\n\"My aunt, I can expect almost anything of you, but I had hardly expected\r\na _succès de beauté_.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the diplomats who play so prominent a part in Roman society, the\r\nJonkheer John Loudon, Secretary of the Netherlands Legation, was one of\r\nher favorite visitors; there are frequent mentions of his singing, which\r\nshe took pleasure in accompanying.\r\n\r\n\"_January 15._ We had a pleasant drive to Villa Madama where we bought\r\nfresh eggs from a peasant. Cola cut much greenery for us with which Maud\r\nhad our rooms decorated. Attended Mrs. Heywood's reception, where met\r\nsome pleasant people--the Scudder party; an English Catholic named\r\nChristmas, who visits the poor, and reports the misery among them as\r\nvery great; a young priest from Boston, Monsignor O'Connell;[123] a Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Mulhorn, Irish,--he strong on statistics, she a writer on\r\nCeltic antiquities,--has published a paper on the Celtic origin of the\r\n'Divina Commedia,' and has written one on the discovery of America by\r\nIrish Danes, five hundred years before Columbus.\"\r\n\r\n  [123] Now Cardinal O'Connell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. J. C. Heywood lived a few doors from the Rusticucci in the\r\nPalazzo Giraud Torlonia, one of the finest Roman palaces. Mr. Heywood\r\nheld an office in the Papal Court, and had a papal title which he was\r\nwise enough not to use in general society. He was an American, a Harvard\r\ngraduate of the class of 1855. His chief occupation, outside of his\r\nduties at the Vatican, was the collection of a fine library. His house\r\nwas a rendezvous of Black[124] society. He lived in much state and\r\nentertained with brilliant formality. Among the great social events of\r\nthat winter was his reception given for Cardinal Satolli, who arrived\r\ndressed in splendid vestments, escorted by his suite. The hostess\r\ncourtesied to the ground and kissed the ring on his finger. All the\r\nother Catholic ladies followed suit. Sitting very straight in her chair,\r\nour mother bided her time; finally the Cardinal was brought to her. He\r\nwas a genial, courteous man and very soon they were deep in friendly\r\ntalk. Though she disliked the Roman hierarchy as an institution, she\r\ncounted many friends among the priests of Rome.\r\n\r\n  [124] _I.e._, Clerical.\r\n\r\n\"_January 18._ To St. Peter's. The Festival of St. Peter's Chair.\r\nVespers in the usual side chapel. Music on the whole good, some sopranos\r\nrather ragged, but parts beautifully sung. Was impressed as usual by the\r\nheterogeneous attendance--tourists with campstools and without,\r\necclesiastics of various grades, students, friars; one splendid\r\nworking-man in his corduroys stood like a statue, in an attitude of\r\nfixed attention. Lowly fathers and mothers carrying small children. One\r\nlady, seated high at the base of a column, put her feet on the seat of\r\nmy stool behind me. Saw the gorgeous ring on the finger of the statue of\r\nSt. Peter.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 19._ Have composed a letter to Professor Lanciani, asking for\r\na talk on the afternoon of February 9, proposing 'Houses and\r\nHousekeeping in Ancient Rome,' and 'The Sibyls of Italy.' Mr. Baddeley\r\ncame in, and we had an interesting talk, mostly about the ancient\r\nCæsars, Mrs. Hollins asking, 'Why did the Romans put up with the bad\r\nCæsars?' He thought the increase of wealth under Augustus was the\r\nbeginning of a great deterioration of the people and the officials.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 21._ Went in the afternoon to call upon Baroness Giacchetti.\r\nHad a pleasant talk with her husband, an enlightened man. He recognizes\r\nthe present status of Rome as greatly superior to the ancient order of\r\nthings--but laments the ignorance and superstition of the common people\r\nin general, and the peasantry in particular. A sick woman, restored to\r\nhealth by much trouble taken at his instance, instead of thanking him\r\nfor his benefactions, told him that she intended to make a pilgrimage to\r\nthe shrine of a certain Madonna, feeling sure that it was to her that\r\nshe owed her cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 26._ The day of my reading before the Club, at Jessie\r\nCochrane's rooms. I read my lecture over very carefully in the forenoon\r\nand got into the spirit of it. The gathering was a large one, very\r\nattentive, and mostly very appreciative. The paper was 'Woman in the\r\nGreek Drama.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 31._ Have made a special prayer that my mind may be less\r\noccupied with my own shortcomings, and more with all that keeps our best\r\nhope alive. Felt little able to write, but produced a good page on the\r\nprinciple '_nulla dies sine linea_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 4._ Hard sledding for words to-day--made out something about\r\nTheodore Parker.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 7._ Wrote some pages of introduction for the\r\nSymposium--played a rubber of whist with L. Terry; then to afternoon tea\r\nwith Mrs. Thorndike, where I met the first Monsignor [Dennis] O'Connell,\r\nwith whom I had a long talk on the woman question, in which he seems\r\nmuch interested. He tells me of a friend, Zahm by name, now gone to a\r\nplace in Indiana, who has biographies of the historical women of\r\nBologna.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 9._ Club at Mrs. Broadwood's. I read my 'Plea for Humor,'\r\nwhich seemed to please the audience very much, especially Princess\r\nTalleyrand and Princess Poggia-Suasa.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 11._ Read over my paper on 'Optimism and Pessimism' and have\r\ngot into the spirit of it. Maud's friends came at 3 P.M., among them\r\nChristian Ross, the painter, with Björnstjerne Björnson.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 16._ To Mrs. Hurlburt's reception.--Talked with Countess\r\nBlank, an American married to a Pole. She had much to say of the piety\r\nof her Arab servant, who, she says, swallows fire, cuts himself with\r\nsharp things, etc., as acts of devotion!! Met Mr. Trench, son of the\r\nlate Archbishop, Rev. Chevenix Trench. He has been Tennyson's publisher.\r\nDid not like T. personally--said he was often rude--read his own poems\r\naloud constantly and very badly; said, 'No man is a hero to his\r\npublisher.' Told about his sale of Henry George's book, a cheap edition,\r\none hundred and fifty thousand copies sold in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 18._ Have done a good morning's work and read in the\r\n'Nineteenth Century' an article on Nelson, and one on the new astronomy.\r\nSt. Thomas Aquinas's advice regarding the election of an abbot from\r\nthree candidates:--\r\n\r\n\"'What manner of man is the first?'\r\n\r\n\"'_Doctissimus._'\r\n\r\n\"'_Doceat_,' says St. Thomas. 'And the second?'\r\n\r\n\"'_Sanctissimus._'\r\n\r\n\"'_Oret!_ and the third?'\r\n\r\n\"'_Prudentissimus!_'\r\n\r\n\"'_Regat!_ Let him rule!' says the Saint.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 20._ To Methodist Church of Rev. Mr. Burt. A sensible short\r\ndiscourse--seems a very sincere man: has an earlier service for\r\nItalians, well attended. On my way home, stopped at Gargiulo's and\r\nbought a ragged but very good copy of the 'Divina Commedia,' unbound,\r\nwith Doré's illustrations.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 26._ To tea at Mrs. Hazeltine's where met William Allen\r\nButler, author of 'Nothing to Wear'--a bright-eyed, conversable man.\r\nHave a sitting to Anderson. When I returned from Mrs. Hazeltine's I\r\nfound Hall Caine.... He told much about Gabriel Rossetti, with whom he\r\nhad much to do. Rossetti was a victim of chloral, and Caine was set to\r\nkeep him from it, except in discreet doses.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 4._ Went to see the King and Queen, returning from the review of\r\ntroops. They were coldly received. She wore crimson velvet--he was on\r\nhorseback and in uniform....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 9._ Club at Jessie Cochrane's; young Loyson, son of Père\r\nHyacinthe, gave an interesting lecture on the religion of Ancient Rome,\r\nwhich he traced back to its rude Latin beginning; the Sabines, he\r\nthought, introduced into it one element of spirituality. Its mythology\r\nwas borrowed from Greece and from the Etruscans--later from Egypt and\r\nthe East. The Primitive Aryan religion was the worship of ancestors.\r\nThis also we see in Rome. A belief in immortality appears in the true\r\nAryan faith. Man, finding himself human, and related to the divine, felt\r\nthat he could not die.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 15_.... Mme. Helbig gave us an account of the Russian pilgrimage\r\nwhich came here lately. Many of the pilgrims were peasants. They\r\ntravelled from Russia on foot, wearing bark shoes, which are very\r\nyielding and soft. These Russian ladies deprecated the action of Peter\r\nthe Great in building St. Petersburg, and in forcing European\r\ncivilization upon his nation, when still unprepared for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 18_.... Drove with Maud, to get white thorn from Villa Madama.\r\nWent afterwards to Mrs. Waldo Story's reception, where met Mrs.\r\nMcTavish, youngest daughter of General Winfield Scott. I was at school\r\nwith one of her older sisters, Virginia, who became a nun.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the winter wore away and the early Roman spring broke, the last\r\nvestige of the discomfort of the first weeks vanished. The daily drives\r\nto the country in search of wild flowers were an endless delight, as\r\nwell as the trips to the older quarters of the city. She found that,\r\nwhile during the first weeks she had lost the habit of looking keenly\r\nabout at the sights, the old joy soon came back to her, and now she was\r\nquick to see every picturesque figure in the crowd, every classic\r\nfragment in the architecture. \"The power of seeing beautiful things,\r\nlike all other powers, must be exercised to be preserved,\" she once\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"_March 19._ I have not dared to work to-day, as I am to read this\r\nafternoon. The reading was well attended and was more than well\r\nreceived. Hall Caine came afterwards, and talked long about the Bible.\r\nHe does not appear to be familiar with the most recent criticism of\r\neither Old or New Testament.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 24._ 'There is a third silent party to all our bargains.'\r\n[Emerson.]\r\n\r\n\"I find this passage in his essay on 'Compensation' to-day for the first\r\ntime, having written my essay on 'Moral Triangulation of the Third\r\nParty' some thirty years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 26._ Dined with Mrs. McCreary--the Duke of San Martino took me\r\nin to dinner--Monsignor Dennis O'Connell sat on the other side of me. I\r\nhad an interesting talk with him. Mrs. McCreary sang my 'Battle Hymn.'\r\nThey begged me to recite 'The Flag,' which I did. Mrs. Pearse, daughter\r\nof Mario and Grisi, sang delightfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 30._ A fine luncheon party given by Mrs. Iddings, wife of the\r\nAmerican Secretary of Embassy at the Grand Hotel. Mme. Ristori was\r\nthere; I had some glimpses of reminiscence with her. I met her with 'La\r\nterribil' Medea,' which I so well remember hearing from her. I\r\npresently quoted her toast in 'La Locandiera,' of which she repeated the\r\nlast two lines. Maud had arranged to have Mrs. Hurlburt help me home.\r\nContessa Spinola also offered, but I got off alone, came home in time to\r\nhear most of Professor Pansotti's lecture on the Gregorian music, which,\r\nthough technical, was interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 31._ I woke up at one, after vividly dreaming of my father and\r\nDr. Francis. My father came in, and said to me that he wished to speak\r\nto Miss Julia alone. I trembled, as I so often did, lest I was about to\r\nreceive some well-merited rebuke. He said that he wished my sister and\r\nme to stay at home more. I saw the two faces very clearly. My father's I\r\nhad not seen for fifty-nine years.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 6._ Went in the afternoon with Mrs. Stillman to the Campo dei\r\nFiori, where bought two pieces of lace for twenty _lire_ each, and a\r\nlittle cap-pin for five _lire_. Saw a small ruby and diamond ring which\r\nI very much fancied.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 10._ Easter Sunday, passed quietly at home. Had an early walk on\r\nthe terrace.... A good talk with Hamilton Aïdé, who told me of the\r\nSpartali family. In the afternoon to Lady Kenmare's reception and later\r\nto dine with the Lindall Winthrops.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 11._ In the afternoon Harriet Monroe, of Chicago, came and read\r\nher play--a parlor drama, ingenious and well written. The audience were\r\nmuch pleased with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 13_.... In the evening dined with Theodore Davis and Mrs.\r\nAndrews. Davis showed us his treasures gathered on the Nile shore and\r\ngave me a scarab.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 18._... Went to hear Canon Farrar on the 'Inferno' of Dante--the\r\nlecture very scholarly and good.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 22._ With Anderson to the Vatican, to see the Pinturicchio\r\nfrescoes, which are very interesting. He designed the tiling for the\r\nfloors, which is beautiful in color, matching well with the\r\nfrescoes--these represent scenes in the life of the Virgin and of St.\r\nCatherine....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 24._ To Miss Leigh Smith's, where I read my sermon on the 'Still\r\nSmall Voice' to a small company of friends, explaining that it was\r\nwritten in the first instance for the Concord Prison, and that I read it\r\nthere to the convicts. I prefaced the sermon by reading one of the\r\nparables in my 'Later Lyrics,' 'Once, where men of high pretension,'\r\netc....\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of several occasions when she read a sermon at the house of\r\nMiss Leigh Smith, a stanch Unitarian, who lived at the Trinità de' Monti\r\nin the house near the top of the Spanish Steps, held by generations of\r\nEnglish and American residents the most advantageous dwelling in Rome.\r\nOn Sunday mornings, when the bells of Rome thrilled the air with the\r\ncall to prayer, a group of exiles from many lands gathered in the\r\npleasant English-looking drawing-room. From the windows they could look\r\ndown upon the flower-decked Piazza di Spagna, hear the song of the\r\nnightingales in the Villa Medici, breathe the perfume of violets and\r\nalmond blossoms from the Pincio. This morning, or another, Paul\r\nSabatier was among the listeners, a grave, gracious man, a Savoyard\r\npastor, whose \"Life of Saint Francis of Assisi\" had set all Rome\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\n\"_April 25._ To lunch with the Drapers. Had some good talk with Mr. D.\r\n[the American Ambassador]. He was brought up at Hopedale in the\r\nCommunity, of which his father was a member, his mother not altogether\r\nacquiescing. He went into our Civil War when only twenty years of age,\r\nhaving the day before married a wife. He was badly wounded in the battle\r\nof the Wilderness. Mosby [guerilla] met the wounded train, and stripped\r\nthem of money and watches, taking also the horses of their conveyances.\r\nA young Irish lad of fourteen saved Draper's life by running to Bull\r\nPlain for aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 26._ Lunch at Daisy Chanler's, to meet Mrs. Sanford, of\r\nHamilton, Canada, who is here in the interests of the International\r\nCouncil of Women. She seems a nice, whole-souled woman.... I have\r\npromised to preside at a meeting, called at Daisy's rooms for Thursday,\r\nto carry forward such measures as we can and to introduce Mrs. Sanford\r\nand interpret for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 27._ Devoted the forenoon to a composition in French, setting\r\nforth the objects of the meeting....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 28._ Went carefully over my French address. In the afternoon\r\nattended the meeting at Daisy's where I presided.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first time the Italian women had taken part in the\r\nInternational Council.\r\n\r\n\"_April 30._ To Contessa di Taverna at Palazzo Gabrielli, where I met\r\nthe little knot of newly elected officers of the Council of Italian\r\nWomen that is to be. Read them my report of our first meeting--they\r\nchattered a great deal. Mrs. Sanford was present. She seemed grateful\r\nfor the help I had tried to give to her plan of a National Council of\r\nItalian Women. I induced the ladies present to subscribe a few _lire_\r\neach, for the purchase of a book for the secretary, for postage and for\r\nthe printing of their small circular. Hope to help them more further\r\non....\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 1._... I gave my 'Rest' sermon at Miss Leigh Smith's....\r\nAfterwards to lunch with the dear Stillman Muse. Lady Airlie and the\r\nThynne sisters were there. Had a pleasant talk with Lady Beatrice....\r\nWrote a letter to be read at the Suffrage Festival in Boston on May\r\n17....\"\r\n\r\nLady Beatrice and Lady Katherine Thynne; the latter was married later to\r\nLord Cromer, Viceroy of Egypt. The Ladies Thynne were passing the winter\r\nwith their cousin, the Countess of Kenmare, at her pleasant apartment in\r\nthe Via Gregoriana. Among the guests one met at Lady Kenmare's was a\r\ndark, handsome Monsignore who spoke English like an Oxford Don, and\r\nlooked like a Torquemada. Later he became Papal Secretary of State and\r\nCardinal Merry del Val.\r\n\r\n\"_May 2._ Have worked as usual. A pleasant late drive. Dined with\r\nEleutherio,[125] Daisy Chanler, and Dr. Bull; whist afterwards; news of\r\nan engagement and victory for us off Manila.\"\r\n\r\n  [125] Her brother-in-law, Luther Terry.\r\n\r\n\"_May 4_.... We dined with Marchese and Marchesa de Viti de Marco at\r\nPalazzo Orsini. Their rooms are very fine, one hung with beautiful\r\ncrimson damask. An author, Pascarello, was present, who has written\r\ncomic poems in the Romanesque dialect, the principal one a mock\r\nnarrative of the discovery of America by Columbus. Our host is a very\r\nintelligent man, much occupied with questions of political economy, of\r\nwhich science he is professor at the Collegio Romano. His wife, an\r\nAmerican, is altogether pleasing. He spoke of the present Spanish War,\r\nof which foreigners understand but little.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 5._ A visit from Contessa di Taverna to confer with me about the\r\nnew departure [the International Council of Women]. She says that the\r\nladies will not promise to pay the stipulated contribution, five hundred\r\n_lire_ once in five years, to the parent association....\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 8._ An exquisite hour with dear Maud on the terrace--the roses in\r\ntheir glory, red, white, and yellow; honeysuckle out, brilliant. We sat\r\nin a sheltered spot, talked of things present and to come. Robert\r\nCollyer to lunch. I asked him to say grace, which he did in his lovely\r\nmanner. He enjoyed Maud's terrace with views of St. Peter's and the\r\nmountains. In the afternoon took a little drive.\r\n\r\n\"Several visitors called, among them Louisa Broadwood, from whom I\r\nlearned that the little Committee for a Woman's Council is going on. The\r\nladies have decided not to join the International at present, but to try\r\nand form an Italian Council first. Some good results are already\r\nbeginning to appear in the coöperation of two separate charities in some\r\npart of their work.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 9._ I must now give all diligence to my preparation for departure.\r\nCannot write more on 'Reminiscences' until I reach home. Maud made a\r\ndead set against my going to Countess Resse's where a number of ladies\r\nhad been invited to meet me. I most unwillingly gave up this one\r\nopportunity of helping the Woman's Cause; I mean this one remaining\r\noccasion, as I have already spoken twice to women and have given two\r\nsermons and read lectures five times. It is true that there might have\r\nbeen some exposure in going to Mme. R.'s, especially in coming out after\r\nspeaking.\"\r\n\r\nA few years after this, the Association which she did so much to found,\r\nheld the first Woman's Congress ever given in Italy, at the Palace of\r\nJustice in Rome. It was an important and admirably conducted convention.\r\nThe work for the uplift of the sex is going on steadily and well in\r\nItaly to-day.\r\n\r\n\"_May 12._ Sat to Villegas all forenoon. Had a little time on the\r\nterrace. Thought I would christen it the 'Praise God.' The flowers seem\r\nto me to hold their silent high mass, swinging their own censers of\r\nsweet incense. Went to Jack's studio and saw his splendid work.[126] In\r\nthe afternoon went with my brother-in-law to the cemetery to visit dear\r\nLouisa's grave. Jack had cut for me many fine roses from the terrace.\r\nWe dropped many on this dear resting-place of one much and justly\r\nbeloved.... Dear old Majesty of Rome, this is my last writing here. I\r\nthank God most earnestly for so much.\"\r\n\r\n  [126] Elliott was at work upon his Triumph of Time, a ceiling decoration\r\n  for the Boston Public Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nEIGHTY YEARS\r\n\r\n1899-1900; _aet._ 80-81\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMANITY\r\n\r\n  Methought a moment that I stood\r\n  Where hung the Christ upon the Cross,\r\n  Just when mankind had writ in blood\r\n  The record of its dearest loss.\r\n\r\n  The bitter drink men offered him\r\n  His kingly gesture did decline,\r\n  And my heart sought, in musing dim,\r\n  Some cordial for those lips divine.\r\n\r\n  When lo! a cup of purest gold\r\n  My trembling fingers did uphold;\r\n  Within it glowed a wine as red\r\n  As hearts, not grapes, its drops had shed.\r\n  Drink deep, my Christ, I offer thee\r\n  The ransom of Humanity.\r\n\r\n                                            J. W. H.\r\n\r\n     Though Jesus, alas! is as little understood in doctrine as followed\r\n     in example. For he has hitherto been like a beautiful figure set to\r\n     point out a certain way, and people at large have been so entranced\r\n     with worshipping the figure, that they have neglected to follow the\r\n     direction it indicates.\r\n\r\n                                            J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1898-99 saw the publication of \"From Sunset Ridge; Poems\r\nOld and New.\" This volume contained many of the poems from \"Later\r\nLyrics\" (long out of print), and also much of her later work. It met\r\nwith a warm recognition which gave her much pleasure.\r\n\r\nLate in 1899 appeared the \"Reminiscences,\" on which she had been so long\r\nat work. These were even more warmly received, though many people\r\nthought them too short. Colonel Higginson said the work might have been\r\n\"spread out into three or four interesting octavos; but in her hurried\r\ngrasp it is squeezed into one volume, where groups of delightful\r\ninterviews with heroes at home and abroad are crowded into some single\r\nsentence.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was written mostly from memory, with little use of the\r\nJournals, and none of the family letters and papers, which she had\r\ncarefully preserved through many years; she needed none of these things.\r\nHer past was always alive, and she went hand in hand with its dear and\r\ngracious figures.\r\n\r\nBut we have outstripped the Journals and must go back to the beginning\r\nof 1899.\r\n\r\n\"[_Boston._] _January 1, 1899._ I begin this year with an anxious mind.\r\nI am fighting the Wolf, hand to hand. I am also confused between the\r\nwork already done on my 'Reminiscences,' and that still wanting to give\r\nthem some completeness. May the All-Father help me!\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 9._ Dined with the Massachusetts Press Club Association. I\r\nmade a little speech partly thought out beforehand. The best bit in\r\nit--'Why should we fear to pass from the Old Testament of our own\r\nliberties, to the New Testament of liberty for all the world?'--came to\r\nme on the spur of the moment....\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 16._ ... Dickens Party at the New England Woman's Club. I\r\ndespaired of being able to go, but did manage to get up a costume and\r\ntake part. Many very comical travesties, those of Pickwick and Captain\r\nCuttle remarkably good; also Lucia M. Peabody as Martin Chuzzlewit, and\r\nMrs. Godding in full male dress suit. I played a Virginia reel and\r\nfinally danced myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe part she herself took on this occasion was that of Mrs. Jellyby, a\r\ncharacter she professed to resemble. At another club party she\r\nimpersonated Mrs. Jarley, with a fine collection of celebrities, which\r\nshe exhibited proudly. She always put on her best motley for her \"dear\r\nClub\"; and in those days its fooling was no less notable than its\r\nwisdom. Among other things, she instituted the Poetical Picnics, picnic\r\nsuppers to which every member must bring an original poem: some of her\r\nbest nonsense was recited at these suppers.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that she had the gift of the word in season. This was\r\noften shown at the Club; especially when, as sometimes happened, a\r\nquestion of the hour threatened to become \"burning.\" It is remembered\r\nhow one day a zealous sister thundered so loud against corporal\r\npunishment that some mothers and grandames were roused to equally ardent\r\nrejoinder. The President was appealed to.\r\n\r\n\"_Dear_ Mrs. Howe, I am sure that _you_ never laid a hand on _your_\r\nchildren!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said dear Mrs. Howe. \"I cuffed 'em a bit when I thought they\r\nneeded it!\"\r\n\r\nEven \"militancy\" could be touched lightly by her. Talk was running high\r\non the subject one day; eyes began to flash ominously, voices took on \"a\r\nwire edge,\" as she expressed it. Again the appeal was made.\r\n\r\n\"Can you imagine, Mrs. Howe, under _any_ circumstances--\"\r\n\r\nThe twinkle came into the gray eyes. \"Well!\" she said. \"I am pretty old,\r\nbut I _think_ I could manage a broomstick!\"\r\n\r\nThe tension broke in laughter, and the sisters were sisters once more.\r\n\r\n\"_January 23._ Worked as usual. Attended the meeting in favor of the\r\nAbolition of the Death Penalty, which was interesting.... I spoke on the\r\nground of hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 7._ ... I hope to take life more easily now than for some\r\ntime past, and to have rest from the slavery of pen and ink.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 28._ ... Was interviewed by a Miss X, who has persevered in\r\ntrying to see me, and at last brought a note from ----. She is part\r\neditor of a magazine named 'Success,' and, having effected an entrance,\r\nproceeded to interview me, taking down my words for her magazine, thus\r\ngetting my ideas without payment, a very mean proceeding....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 21._ Tuskegee benefit, Hollis Street Theatre.\r\n\r\n\"This meeting scored a triumph, not only for the performers, but for the\r\nrace. Bishop Lawrence presided with much good grace and appreciation.\r\nPaul Dunbar was the least distinct. Professor Dubois, of Atlanta\r\nUniversity, read a fine and finished discourse. Booker Washington was\r\neloquent as usual, and the Hampton quartet was delightful. At the tea\r\nwhich followed at Mrs. Whitman's studio, I spoke with these men and\r\nwith Dunbar's wife, a nearly white woman of refined appearance. I asked\r\nDubois about the negro vote in the South. He thought it better to have\r\nit legally taken away than legally nullified.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 17._ Kindergarten for the Blind.... I hoped for a good word to\r\nsay, but could only think of Shakespeare's 'The evil that men do lives\r\nafter them; the good is oft interred with their bones,' intending to say\r\nthat this does not commend itself to me as true. Mr. Eels spoke before\r\nme and gave me an occasion to use this with more point than I had hoped.\r\nHe made a rather flowery discourse, and eulogized Annie Sullivan and\r\nHelen Keller as a new experience in human society. In order to show how\r\nthe good that men do survives them, I referred to Dr. Howe's first\r\nefforts for the blind and to his teaching of Laura Bridgman, upon whom I\r\ndwelt somewhat....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 23._... Had a sort of dream-vision of the dear Christ going\r\nthrough Beacon Street in shadow, and then in his glory. It was only a\r\nflash of a moment's thought....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 25._ To Alliance, the last meeting of the season. Mrs. ----\r\nspoke, laying the greatest emphasis on women acting so as to _express\r\nthemselves in freedom_. This ideal of self-expression appears to me\r\ninsufficient and dangerous, if taken by itself. I mentioned its\r\ninsufficiency, while recognizing its importance. I compared feminine\r\naction under the old limitations to the touching of an electric eel,\r\nwhich immediately gives one a paralyzing shock. I spoke also of the new\r\nwoman world as at present constituted, as like the rising up from the\r\nsea of a new continent. In my own youth women were isolated from each\r\nother by the very intensity of their personal consciousness. I thought\r\nof myself and of other women in this way. We thought that superior women\r\nought to have been born men. A blessed change is that which we have\r\nwitnessed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs her eightieth birthday drew nigh, her friends vied with one another\r\nin loving observance of the time. The festivities began May 17 with a\r\nmeeting of the New England Women's Press Association, where she gave a\r\nlecture on \"Patriotism in Literature\" and received \"eighty beautiful\r\npink roses for my eighty years.\"\r\n\r\nNext came the \"annual meeting and lunch of the New England Woman's Club.\r\nThis took the character of a pre-celebration of my eightieth birthday,\r\nand was highly honorific. I can only say that I do not think of myself\r\nas the speakers seemed to think of me. Too deeply do I regret my seasons\r\nof rebellion, and my shortcomings in many duties. Yet am I thankful for\r\nso much good-will. I only deserve it because I return it.\"\r\n\r\nBetween this and the day itself came a memorial meeting in honor of the\r\nninety-sixth anniversary of Emerson's birth. Here she spoke \"mostly of\r\nthe ladies of his family\"--Emerson's mother and his wife. Said also,\r\n\"Emerson was as great in what he did not say as in what he said.\r\nSecond-class talent tells the whole story, reasons everything out;\r\ngreat genius suggests even more than it says.\"\r\n\r\nShe was already what she used to call \"Boston's old spoiled child!\" All\r\nthrough the birthday flowers, letters, and telegrams poured into the\r\nhouse. From among the tokens of love and reverence may be chosen the\r\nquatrain sent by Richard Watson Gilder:--\r\n\r\n  \"How few have rounded out so full a life!\r\n      Priestess of righteous war and holy peace,\r\n  Poet and sage, friend, sister, mother, wife,\r\n      Long be it ere that noble heart shall cease!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Woman's Journal\" issued a special Birthday number. It was a lovely\r\nand heart-warming anniversary, the pleasure of which long remained with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAmong the guests was the beloved physician of many years, William P.\r\nWesselhoeft. Looking round on the thronged and flower-decked rooms, he\r\nsaid, \"This is all very fine, Mrs. Howe; but on your ninetieth birthday\r\nI shall come, and _nobody else_!\" Alas! before that day the lion voice\r\nwas silent, the cordial presence gone.\r\n\r\nThree days later came an occasion which stirred patriotic Boston to its\r\ndepths. The veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic had invited\r\nMajor-General Joseph Wheeler to deliver the Memorial Day oration in\r\nBoston Theatre. Our mother was the second guest of honor. She has\r\nnothing to say of this occasion beyond the fact that she \"had a great\r\ntime in the morning,\" and that in the open carriage with her sat\r\n\"General Wheeler's two daughters--_very_ pleasing girls\"; but pasted in\r\nthe Journal is the following clipping from the \"Philadelphia Press\":--\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON WARMED UP\r\n\r\nThe Major has just returned from Boston, where he was present at the\r\nMemorial Day services held in Boston Theatre.\r\n\r\nIt was the real thing. I never imagined possible such a genuine sweeping\r\nemotion as when that audience began to sing the \"Battle Hymn.\" If Boston\r\nwas cold, it was thawed by the demonstration on Tuesday. Myron W.\r\nWhitney started to sing. He bowed to a box, in which we first recognized\r\nMrs. Howe, sitting with the Misses Wheeler. You should have heard the\r\nyell. We could see the splendid white head trembling; then her voice\r\njoined in, as Whitney sang, \"In the beauty of the lilies,\" and by the\r\ntime he had reached the words,--\r\n\r\n  \"As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,\"--\r\n\r\nthe whole vast audience was on its feet, sobbing and singing at the top\r\nof its thousands of lungs. If volunteers were really needed for the\r\nPhilippines, McKinley could have had us all right there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same evening she went \"to Unitarian meeting in Tremont Temple, where\r\nread my screed about Governor Andrew, which has cost me some work and\r\nmore anxiety. Rev. S. A. Eliot, whom I saw for the first time, was\r\ncharmingly handsome and friendly. I was introduced as 'Saint Julia' and\r\nthe whole audience rose when I came forward to read. Item: I had dropped\r\nmy bag with my manuscript in the carriage, but Charles Fox telephoned to\r\nthe stable and got it for me.\"\r\n\r\nThe spring of this year saw an epidemic of negro-lynching, which roused\r\ndeep indignation throughout the country. On May 20 the Journal records\r\n\"a wonderful meeting at Chickering Hall, called by the colored women of\r\nBoston, to protest against the lynching of negroes in the South. Mrs.\r\nButler M. Wilson presided, an octoroon and a woman of education. Her\r\nopening address was excellent in spirit and in execution. A daughter of\r\nMrs. Ruffin also wrote an excellent address: Mrs. Cheney's was very\r\nearnest and impressive. Alice Freeman Palmer spoke as I have never\r\nbefore heard her. My rather brief speech was much applauded, as were\r\nindeed all of the others. Mrs. Richard Hallowell was on the platform and\r\nintroduced Mrs. Wilson.\"\r\n\r\nThis brief speech brought upon her a shower of letters, mostly\r\nanonymous, from persons who saw only the anti-negro side of this matter,\r\nso dreadful in every aspect. These letters were often denunciatory,\r\nsometimes furious in tone, especially one addressed to\r\n\r\n                       _Mrs. Howe, Negro Sympathizer,\r\n\r\n                                                        Boston._\r\n\r\nThis grieved her, but she did not cease to lift up her voice against the\r\nevil thing whenever occasion offered.\r\n\r\n\"_July 7._ _Oak Glen._ ... My son and his wife came over from Bristol to\r\npass the day. He looks as young as my grandsons do. At fifty, his hair\r\nis blond, without gray, and his forehead unwrinkled.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 16._ ... While in church I had a new thought of the energy and\r\ninfluence of Christ's teaching. 'Ask and ye shall receive,' etc. These\r\nlittle series of commands all incite the hearers to action: Ask, seek,\r\nknock. I should love to write a sermon on this, but fear my sermonizing\r\ndays are over, alas!\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 7._ Determined to do more literary work daily than I have been\r\ndoing lately. Began a screed about dear Bro' Sam, feeling that he\r\ndeserved a fuller mention than I have already given him....\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 4._ Discouraged over the confusion of my papers, the failure\r\nof printers to get on with my book, and my many bills. Have almost had\r\nan attack of the moral sickness which the Italians call _Achidia_. I\r\nsuppose it to mean indifference and indolence....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                    OAK GLEN, September 6, 1899.\r\n\r\n... Here's a question. Houghton and Mifflin desire to print[127] the\r\nrough draft of my \"Battle Hymn,\" which they borrowed, with some\r\ndifficulty, from Charlotte Whipple, who begged it of me, years ago. I\r\nhesitate to allow it, because it contains a verse which I discarded, as\r\nnot up to the rest of the poem. It will undoubtedly be an additional\r\nattraction for the volume....\r\n\r\n  [127] In the _Reminiscences_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_September 7._ Have attacked my proofs fiercely....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                   OAK GLEN, September 16, 1899.\r\n\r\nYours received, _très chère_. Why not consult Hays Gardiner[128] about\r\nprinting the original draft of the \"Hymn\"? Win's[129] opinion would be\r\nworth having, also. I think I shall consult E. E. Hale, albeit the two\r\njust named would be more fastidious.[130]\r\n\r\n  [128] The late John Hays Gardiner, author of _The Bible as Literature_,\r\n  _The Forms of Prose Literature_, and _Harvard_.\r\n\r\n  [129] Edwin Arlington Robinson, author of _Captain Craig_, etc.\r\n\r\n  [130] The facsimile printed in the _Reminiscences_ contains the\r\n  discarded stanza.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_October 21._ My last moments in this dear place. The past season\r\nappears to me like a gift of perfect jewels. I pray that the winter may\r\nhave in store for me some good work and much dear and profitable\r\ncompanionship. I must remember that this may be my last summer here, or\r\nanywhere on earth, but must bear in mind that it is best to act with a\r\nview to prolonged life, since without this outlook, it is very hard for\r\nus to endeavor or to do our best. Peace be with you, beautiful summer\r\nand autumn. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nShe was never ready to leave Oak Glen; the town house always seemed at\r\nfirst like a prison.\r\n\r\n\"_October 23_. Boston. A drizzly, dark day. I struggled out twice,\r\nsaying to myself: 'It is for your life.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 24._ Have had two days of chaos and discouragement....\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 27._ A delightful and encouraging conference of A.A.W. held in\r\nmy parlors. The prevailing feeling was that we should not disband, but\r\nshould hold on to our association and lie by, hoping to find new innings\r\nfor work. Florida was spoken of as good ground for us. I felt much\r\ncheered and quickened by the renewal of old friendships....\"\r\n\r\nA Western lecture trip had been planned for this autumn, but certain\r\nuntoward symptoms developed and Dr. Wesselhoeft said, \"No! no! not even\r\nif you had not had vertigo.\" She gave it up most reluctantly, confiding\r\nonly to the Journal the hope that she might be able to go later.\r\n\r\n\"_November 9._ Celebration of dear Chev's birthday at the Institution. I\r\nspoke of the New Testament word about the mustard seed, so small but\r\nproducing such a stately tree. I compared this little seed to a\r\nbenevolent impulse in the mind of S. G. H. and the Institution to a\r\ntree. 'What is smaller than a human heart? What seems weaker than a good\r\nintention? Yet the good intention, followed by the faithful heart, has\r\nproduced this great refuge in which many generations have already found\r\nthe way to a life of educated usefulness.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 19...._ Before the sermon I had prayed for some good thought\r\nof God. This came to me in the shape of a sudden perception to this\r\neffect: 'I am in the Father's house already.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 30...._ In giving thanks to-day, I made my only personal\r\npetitions, which were first, that some of my dear granddaughters might\r\nfind suitable husbands, ... and lastly, that I might _serve_ in some way\r\nuntil the last breath leaves my body....\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 16._ I had greatly desired to see the 'Barber.' Kind Mrs.\r\n[Alfred] Batcheller made it possible by inviting me to go with her. The\r\nperformance was almost if not quite _bouffe_. Sembrich's singing\r\nmarvellous, the acting of the other characters excellent, and singing\r\nvery good, especially that of De Reszke and Campanari. I heard the\r\nopera in New York more than seventy years ago, when Malibran, then\r\nSignorina Garcia, took the part of Rosina.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 31...._ 'Advertiser' man came with a query: 'What event in\r\n1899 will have the greatest influence in the world's history?' I\r\nreplied, 'The Czar's Peace Manifesto, leading to the Conference at The\r\nHague.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember, 1899, saw the birth of another institution from which she was\r\nto derive much pleasure, the Boston Authors' Club. Miss Helen M. Winslow\r\nfirst evolved the idea of such a club. After talking with Mmes. May\r\nAlden Ward and Mabel Loomis Todd, who urged her to carry out the\r\nproject, she went to see the \"Queen of Clubs.\" \"Go ahead!\" said our\r\nmother. \"Call some people together here, at my house, and we will form a\r\nclub, and it will be a good one too.\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal of November 23 says:--\r\n\r\n\"Received word from Helen Winslow of a meeting of literary folks called\r\nfor to-morrow morning at my house.\"\r\n\r\nThis meeting was \"very pleasant: Mrs. Ward, Miss Winslow, Jacob Strauss,\r\nand Hezekiah Butterworth attended--later Herbert Ward came in.\"\r\n\r\nIt was voted to form the Boston Authors' Club, and at a second meeting\r\nin December the club was duly organized.\r\n\r\nIn January the Authors' Club made its first public appearance in a\r\nmeeting and dinner at Hotel Vendôme, Mrs. Howe presiding, Colonel\r\nHigginson (whom she described as her \"chief Vice\") beside her.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant and successful course of the Authors' Club need not be\r\ndwelt on here. Her connection with it was to continue through life, and\r\nits monthly meetings and annual dinners were among her pet pleasures.\r\nShe was always ready to \"drop into rhyme\" in its service, the Muse in\r\ncap and bells being oftenest invoked: _e.g._, the verses written for the\r\nfive hundredth anniversary of Chaucer's death:--\r\n\r\n  Poet Chaucer had a sister,\r\n  He, the wondrous melodister.\r\n  She didn't write no poems, oh, no!\r\n  Brother Geoffrey trained her so.\r\n  Honored by the poet's crown,\r\n  Her posterity came down.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Ages of ancestral birth\r\n  Went for all that they were worth.\r\n  Hence derives the Wentworth name\r\n  Which heraldic ranks may claim.\r\n  That same herald has contrived\r\n  How the Higginson arrived.\r\n\r\n  He was gran-ther to the knight\r\n  In whose honor I indite\r\n  Burning strophes of the soul\r\n  'propriate to the flowing bowl.\r\n\r\n  Oft the worth I have defended\r\n  Of the Laureate-descended,\r\n  But while here he sits and winks\r\n  I can tell you what he thinks.\r\n\r\n  \"Never, whether old or young,\r\n  Will that woman hold her tongue!\r\n  Fifty years in Boston schooled,\r\n  Still I find her rhyme-befooled.\r\n\r\n  Oft in earnest, oft in jest,\r\n  We have met and tried our best.\r\n  Nought I dread an open field,\r\n  I can conquer, I can yield,\r\n  Self from foes I can defend,\r\n  But Heav'n preserve us from our friend!\"\r\n\r\nShe and her \"chief Vice\" were always making merry together; when their\r\nflint and steel struck, the flash was laughter. It may have been at the\r\nAuthors' Club that the two, with Edward Everett Hale and Dr. Holmes,\r\nwere receiving compliments and tributes one afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" she cried, \"no one can say that Boston drops its _H's_!\"\r\n\r\nThis was in the winter of 1900. It was the time of the Boer War, and all\r\nChristendom was sorrowing over the conflict. On January 3 the Journal\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"This morning before rising, I had a sudden thought of the Christ-Babe\r\nstanding between the two armies, Boers and Britons, on Christmas Day. I\r\nhave devoted the morning to an effort to overtake the heavenly vision\r\nwith but a mediocre result.\"\r\n\r\nThese lines are published in \"At Sunset.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th the cap and bells are assumed once more.\r\n\r\n\"... To reception of the College Club, where I was to preside over the\r\nliterary exercises and to introduce the readers. I was rather at a loss\r\nhow to do this, but suddenly I thought of Mother Goose's 'When the pie\r\nwas opened, the birds began to sing.' So when Edward Everett Hale came\r\nforward with me and introduced me as 'the youngest person in the hall,'\r\nI said, 'Ladies and Gentlemen, I shall prove the truth of what our\r\nreverend friend has just said, by citing a quotation from Mother Goose\r\n['When the pie was opened,' etc.], and the first bird that I shall\r\nintroduce will be Rev. E. E. Hale.' Beginning thus, I introduced T. W.\r\nHigginson as the great American Eagle; Judge [Robert] Grant as a\r\nmocking-bird; C. F. Adams as the trained German canary who sings all the\r\nsongs of Yawcob Strauss; C. G. Ames said, 'You mustn't call me an owl.'\r\nI brought him forward and said, 'My dear minister says that I must not\r\ncall him an owl, and I will not; only the owl is the bird of wisdom and\r\nhe is very wise.' I introduced Mrs. Moulton as a nightingale. For\r\nTrowbridge I could think of nothing and said, 'This bird will speak for\r\nhimself.' Introduced N. H. Dole as 'a bird rarely seen, the phoenix.'\r\nAt the close E. E. H. said, 'You have an admirable power of\r\nintroducing.' This little device pleased me foolishly.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 4._ Wrote a careful letter to W. F. Savage. He had written,\r\nasking an explanation of some old manuscript copy of my 'Battle Hymn'\r\nand of the theft perpetrated of three of its verses in 'Pen Pictures of\r\nthe War,' only lately brought to my notice. He evidently thought these\r\nmatters implied doubt at least of my having composed the 'Hymn.' To this\r\nsuspicion I did not allude, but showed him how the verses stolen had\r\nbeen altered, probably to avoid detection....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 3._ Count di Campello's lecture, on the religious life in\r\nItaly, was most interesting. His uncle's movement in founding a National\r\nItalian Catholic Church seemed to me to present the first solution I\r\nhave met with, of the absolute opposition between Catholic and\r\nProtestant. A Catholicism without spiritual tyranny, without ignorant\r\nsuperstition, would bridge over the interval between the two opposites\r\nand bring about the unification of the world-church....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 13...._ Passed the whole morning at State House, with\r\nremonstrants against petition forbidding Sunday evening concerts. T. W.\r\nH. spoke remarkably well....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 30...._ Had a special good moment this morning before rising.\r\nFelt that God had granted me a good deal of heaven, while yet on earth.\r\nSo the veil lifts sometimes, not for long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nApril found her in Minneapolis and St. Paul, lecturing and being\r\n\"delightfully entertained.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 8. Minneapolis._ Spoke at the University, which I found\r\ndelightfully situated and richly endowed. Was received with great\r\ndistinction. Spoke, I think, on the fact that it takes the whole of life\r\nto learn the lessons of life. Dwelt a little on the fact that fools are\r\nnot necessarily underwitted. Nay, may be people of genius, the trouble\r\nbeing that they do not learn from experience....\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving she exclaims:--\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, dear St. Paul. I shall never forget you, nor this delightful\r\nvisit, which has renewed (almost) the dreams of youth. In the car a\r\nkind old grandmother, with two fine little boy grands....\r\n\r\n\"The dear old grandmother and her boys got out at the Soo. Other ladies\r\nin the Pullman were _very_ kind to me, especially a lady from St. Paul,\r\nwith her son, who I thought might be a young husband. She laughed much\r\nat this when I mentioned it to her. Had an argument with her, regarding\r\nhypnotism, I insisting that it is demoralizing when used by a strong\r\nwill to subdue a weak one.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 25._ [_Boston._] Went in the afternoon to Unitarian meeting at\r\nTremont Temple. S. A. Eliot made me come up on the platform. He asked if\r\nI would give a word of benediction. I did so, thanking God earnestly in\r\nmy heart for granting me this sweet office, which seemed to lift my soul\r\nabove much which has disturbed it of late. Why is He so good to me?\r\nSurely not to destroy me at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 3...._ Before church had a thought of some sweet spirit asking to\r\ngo to hell to preach to the people there. Thought that if he truly\r\nfulfilled his office, he would not leave even that forlorn\r\npastorate....\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 10...._ Could not find the key to my money bag, which distressed\r\nme much. Promised St. Anthony of Padua that if he would help me, I would\r\ntake pains to find out who he was. Found the key immediately....\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 18...._ The little lump in my right breast hurts me a little\r\nto-day. Have written Wesselhoeft about it. 4.50 P.M. He has seen it and\r\nsays that it is probably cancerous; forbids me to think of an\r\noperation; thinks he can stop it with medicine. When he told me that it\r\nwas in all probability a cancer, I felt at first much unsettled in mind.\r\nI feared that the thought of it would occupy my mind and injure my\r\nhealth by inducing sleeplessness and nervous excitement. Indeed, I had\r\nsome sad and rather vacant hours, but dinner and Julia's[131] company\r\nput my dark thought to flight and I lay down to sleep as tranquilly as\r\nusual.\"\r\n\r\n  [131] Julia Ward Richards.\r\n\r\n[Whatever this trouble was, it evidently brought much suffering, but\r\nfinally disappeared. We learn of it for the first time in this record;\r\nshe never spoke of it to any of her family.]\r\n\r\n\"_Oak Glen. June 21._ Here I am seated once more at my old table,\r\nbeginning another _villeggiatura_, which may easily be my last. Have\r\nread a little Greek and a long article in the 'New World.' I pray the\r\ndear Heavenly Father to help me pass a profitable season here, improving\r\nit as if it were my last, whether it turns out to be so or not.\"\r\n\r\n[She was not in her usual spirits this summer. She felt the heat and the\r\nburden of years. The Journal is mostly in a minor key.]\r\n\r\n\"_July 16._ Took up a poem at which I have been working for some days,\r\non the victims in Pekin; a strange theme, but one on which I feel I have\r\na word to say. Wrote it all over....\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 19._ Was much worn out with the heat. In afternoon my head gave\r\nout and would not serve me for anything but to sit still and observe the\r\nflight of birds and the freaks of yellow butterflies....\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 26._ Have prayed to-day that I may not find life dull. This\r\nprolongation of my days on earth is so precious that I ought not to\r\ncease for one moment to thank God for it. I enjoy my reading as much as\r\never, but I do feel very much the narrowing of my personal relations by\r\ndeath. How rich was I in sisters, brothers, elders! It seems to me now\r\nas if I had not at all appreciated these treasures of affection....\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 31._ Have writ notes of condolence to Mrs. Barthold Schlesinger\r\nand to M. E. Powel. I remember the coming of Mrs. Powel's family to\r\nNewport sixty-five years ago. The elders used to entertain in the simple\r\nways of those days, and my brother Henry and I used to sing one duet\r\nfrom the 'Matrimonio Segreto,' at some of their evening parties. In the\r\nafternoon came the ladies of the Papéterie; had our tea in the green\r\nparlor, which was pretty and pleasant....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                       OAK GLEN, August 3, 1900.\r\n\r\n... I grieve for the death of King Umberto, as any one must who has\r\nfollowed the fortunes of Italy and knows the indebtedness of the country\r\nto the House of Savoy. Thus, the horror of this anarchy, thriving among\r\nItalians in our own country. I am so thankful that the better class\r\namong them have come out so strongly against it! I was present when King\r\nUmberto took the oaths of office, after the death of his father. He was\r\na faithful man, not quite up to the times, perhaps, but his reign was\r\nbeset with problems and difficulties. I am sure that the Queen greatly\r\nrespected and honored him, although I believe that she was first\r\nbetrothed to his brother Amadeo, whom, it is said, she loved. Alas, for\r\nthe tyranny of dynastic necessity. Their only child was very delicate,\r\nand has no child, or had not, when I was in Rome. As to the Chinese\r\nhorror, it is unspeakably dreadful. Even if the ministers are safe,\r\nhundreds of foreigners and thousands of native Christians have been\r\ncruelly massacred. I cannot help hoping that punishment will be swift\r\nand severe....\r\n\r\nA letter from H. M. H. yesterday, in great spirits. At a great public\r\ndinner recently, the president of the association cried: \"_Honneur à\r\nHowe!_\"\r\n\r\n                           Affect.,\r\n                                                         MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_August 17...._ In the evening I was seized with an attack of verse and\r\nat bedtime wrote a rough draft of a _Te Deum_ for the rescue of the\r\nministers in Pekin.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 20...._ Got my poem smooth at some expense of force, perhaps. I\r\nlike the poem. I think that it has been _given_ me.\"\r\n\r\nThis _Te Deum_ was printed in the \"Christian Herald\" in September, 1900.\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday, September 2...._ I had, before service began, a clear thought\r\nthat _self_ is death, and deliverance from its narrow limitations the\r\ntruest emancipation. In my heart I gave thanks to God for all measure in\r\nwhich I have attained, or tried to attain, this liberation. It seems to\r\nme that the one moment of this which we could perfectly attain, would be\r\nan immortal joy.\"\r\n\r\nA week later, she went to New York to attend a reception given to the\r\nMedal of Honor Legion at Brooklyn Academy. She writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Last evening's occasion was to me eminently worth the trouble I had\r\ntaken in coming on. To meet these veterans, face to face, and to receive\r\ntheir hearty greeting, was a precious boon vouchsafed to me so late in\r\nlife. Their reception to me was cordial in the extreme. The audience and\r\nchorus gave me the Chautauqua salute, and as I left the platform, the\r\ngirl chorus sang the last verse of my 'Hymn' over again, in a subdued\r\ntone, as if for me alone. The point which I made, and wished to make,\r\nwas that, 'our flag should only go forth on errands of justice, mercy,\r\netc., and that once sent forth, it should not be recalled until the work\r\nwhereunto it had been pledged was accomplished.' This with a view to\r\nPekin....\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 13...._ The Galveston horror[132] was much in my mind\r\nyesterday.

The\r\nseason, a very busy one, has also been a very blessed one. I cannot be\r\nthankful enough for so much calm delight--my children and grandchildren,\r\nmy books and my work, although this last has caused me many anxieties. I\r\ncannot but feel as old John Forbes did when he left Naushon for the last\r\ntime and went about in his blindness, touching his writing materials,\r\netc., and saying to himself, 'Never again, perhaps.' If it should turn\r\nout so in my case, God's will be done. He knows best when we should\r\ndepart and how long we should stay....\"\r\n\r\n\"On the way home and afterwards, these lines of an old hymn ran in my\r\nmind:--\r\n\r\n  'Fear not, I am with thee, oh, be not afraid.\r\n  I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid.'\r\n\r\nThis comforted me much in the forlorn exchange of my lovely surroundings\r\nat Oak Glen for the imprisonment of a town house.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 4. 241 Beacon Street._ The dear minister preached on 'All\r\nSaints and All Souls,' the double festival of last week. At Communion he\r\nsaid: 'Dear Sister Howe, remember that if you are moved to speak, you\r\nhave freedom to do so.' I had not thought of speaking, but presently\r\nrose and spoke of the two consecrated days. I said: 'As I entered this\r\nchurch to-day, I thought of a beautiful cathedral in which one after\r\nanother the saints whom I have known and loved, appeared on either side;\r\nfirst, the saints of my own happy childhood, then the excellent people\r\nwhom I have known all my life long. The picture of one of them hangs on\r\nthese walls.[133] His memory is fresh in all our hearts. Surely it is a\r\ndivine glory which we have seen in the faces of these friends, and they\r\nseem to lead us up to that dearest and divinest one, whom we call\r\nMaster'; and so on. I record this to preserve this vision of the\r\ncathedral of heart saints....\"\r\n\r\n  [133] James Freeman Clarke.\r\n\r\n\"_December 25._ I was awake soon after five this morning, and a voice,\r\nfelt, not heard, seemed to give me a friendly warning to set my house in\r\norder for my last departure from it. This seems to bring in view my\r\nage, already long past the scriptural limit, suggesting also that I have\r\nsome symptoms of an ailment which does not trouble me much, but which\r\nwould naturally tend to shorten my life. In my mind I promised that I\r\nwould heed the warning given. I only prayed God to make the parting easy\r\nfor me and my dear ones, of whom dear Maud would be the most to be\r\npitied, as she has been most with me and has no child to draw her\r\nthoughts to the future. After this, I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\"We had a merry time at breakfast, examining the Christmas gifts, which\r\nwere numerous and gratifying....\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 31...._ Here ends a year of mercies, of more than my usual\r\nhealth, of power to speak and to write.

We must make the\r\n     round, but we may make it with an upward inclination. \"Let there be\r\n     light!\" is sometimes said in accents so emphatic, that the universe\r\n     remembers and cannot forget it. We carry our problems slowly\r\n     forward. With all the ups and downs of every age, humanity\r\n     constantly rises.

W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_January 7._ I have had a morning of visioning, lying in bed. 'Be still\r\nand know that I am God,' seemed to be my sentence. I thought of the\r\nMagdalen's box of spikenard, whose odor, when the box was broken, filled\r\nthe house. The separate religious convictions of the sects seemed to me\r\nlike so many boxes of ointment, exceedingly precious while shut up, but\r\nI thought also that the dear Lord would one day break these separate\r\nboxes, and that then their fragrance would fill the whole earth, which\r\nis His house.\r\n\r\n\"This is my first writing in this book. From this thought and the 'Be\r\nstill,' I may try to make two sermons.\r\n\r\n\"In afternoon came William Wesselhoeft, Sr., and prescribed entire quiet\r\nand rest for some days to come. Oh! I do long to be at work.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 9._ To-day for the first time since January 3, I have opened a\r\nGreek book. I read in my Æschylus [\"Eumenides\"] how Apollo orders the\r\nFuries to leave his shrine, to go where deeds of barbarity, tortures,\r\nand mutilations are practised.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time she heard of her son's receiving from the Czar the cross of\r\nthe Order of St. Stanislas. She writes to him:--\r\n\r\n\"Goodness gracious me!\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure it isn't by mistake? Do you remember that you are my\r\nnaughty little imp?... Well, well, it takes away my breath! Dearest Boy,\r\nmy heart is lifted up with gratitude. If your father were only here, to\r\nshare our great rejoicing! Joy! joy!...\"\r\n\r\nShe had always taken a deep interest in Queen Victoria, whose age was\r\nwithin three days of her own. Many people fancied a resemblance between\r\nthe two; indeed, when in England as a bride, she was told more than\r\nonce: \"You look like our young Queen!\" It is remembered how one of her\r\ndaughters, knocking at the door of a Maine farmhouse to inquire the way,\r\nwas met by a smiling, \"I know who you are! You are the daughter of the\r\nQueen of America!\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen's death, coming as it did during her own illness, gave her a\r\npainful shock.\r\n\r\n\"_January 23._ The news of Queen Victoria's death quite overcame me for\r\na moment this morning. Instead of settling to my work, I wrote a very\r\ntiny 'bust of feeling' about her, which I carried to the 'Woman's\r\nJournal' office, where I found a suffrage meeting in progress. I could\r\nonly show myself and say that I was not well enough to remain....\"\r\n\r\n\"Bust of feeling\" was a favorite expression of hers. Old Bostonians\r\nwill recall its origin. \"A certain rich man,\" seeing a poor girl injured\r\nin a street accident, offered to pay her doctor's bill. This being\r\npresented in due time, he disclaimed all responsibility in the affair;\r\nand when reminded of his offer, exclaimed, \"Oh, that was a bust of\r\nfeeling!\"\r\n\r\nOn January 31, she was \"in distress of mind all day lest Maud should\r\nabsolutely refuse to let me give my lecture at Phillips Church this\r\nevening.\" Later she writes: \"Maud was very kind and did nothing to\r\nhinder my going to South Boston.\" She went and enjoyed the evening, but\r\nwas not so well after it.\r\n\r\n\"_February 10._ A Sunday at home; unable to venture out. Wesselhoeft,\r\nJr., called, left medicine, and forbade my going out before the cough\r\nhas ceased. Have read in Cheyne's 'Jewish Religious Life after the\r\nExile,' finding the places of reference in the Bible. Afterwards read in\r\n'L'Aiglon,' which is very interesting but not praiseworthy, as it\r\nendeavors to recall the false glory of Napoleon.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 18._ Have been out, first time since February 3, when I went\r\nto church and was physically the worse for it.... Last night had a time\r\nof lying awake with a sort of calm comfort. Woke in the morning full of\r\ninvalid melancholy, intending to keep my bed. Felt much better when in\r\nmotion. Must make a vigorous effort now to get entirely well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese days of seclusion were hard for her, and every effort was made to\r\nbring the \"mountains\" to her, since she could not go to them.\r\n\r\nA club was formed among her friends in Boston for the study and speaking\r\nof Italian: this became one of her great pleasures, and she looked\r\nforward eagerly to the meetings, delighted to hear and to use the\r\nbeautiful speech she had loved since childhood.\r\n\r\n\"_February 22._ The new club, _Il Circolo Italiano_, met at our house.\r\nCount Campello had asked me to say a few words, so I prepared a very\r\nlittle screed in Italian, not daring to trust myself to speak\r\n_extempore_ in this language. We had a large attendance; I thought one\r\nhundred were present. My bit was well received, and the lecture by\r\nProfessor Speranza, of New York, was very interesting, though rather\r\ndifficult to follow. The theme was D'Annunzio's dramas, from which he\r\ngave some quotations and many characterizations. He relegates D'Annunzio\r\nto the Renaissance when _Virtù_ had no real _moral significance_.\r\nCompared him with Ibsen. The occasion was exceedingly pleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _To Laura_\r\n\r\nI had hoped to go to church to-day, but my Maud and your Julia decided\r\nagainst it, and so I am having the day at home. It is just noon by my\r\ndial, and Maud is stretched in my Gardiner chair, comfortably shawled,\r\nand reading Lombroso's book on \"The Man of Genius,\" with steadfast\r\nattention. Lombroso's theory seems to be that genius, almost equally\r\nwith insanity, is a result of degeneration....\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_March 1._ The first day of spring, though in this climate this is a\r\n_wintry_ month. I am thankful to have got on so far in this, my\r\neighty-second year. My greatest trouble is that I use so poorly the\r\nprecious time spared to me. Latterly I have been saying to myself, 'Can\r\nyou not see that the drama is played out?' This partly because my\r\nchildren wish me to give up public speaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 4...._ To New England Woman's Club; first time this year, to my\r\ngreat regret and loss. I was cordially welcomed.... A thought suddenly\r\ncame to me, namely, that the liberal education of women would give the\r\ndeath-blow to superstition. I said, 'We women have been the depositaries\r\nof religious sensibility, but we have also furnished the impregnable\r\nstorehouse of superstition, sometimes gracious, sometimes desperately\r\ncruel and hurtful to our race.' No one noticed this, but I hold fast to\r\nit....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 8...._ To Symphony Concert in afternoon, which I enjoyed but\r\nlittle, the music being of the multi-muddle order so much in vogue just\r\nnow. An air of Haydn's sounded like a sentence of revelation in a\r\nchatter....\"\r\n\r\nIt may have been after this concert that she wrote these lines, found in\r\none of her notebooks:--\r\n\r\n  Such ugly noises never in my life\r\n  My ears endured, such hideous fiddle-strife.\r\n  A dozen street bands playing different tunes,\r\n  A choir of chimney sweeps with various runes,\r\n  The horn that doth to farmer's dinner call,\r\n  The Chinese gong that serves in wealthier hall,\r\n  The hammer, scrub brush, and beseeching broom,\r\n  While here and there the guns of freedom boom,\r\n  \"Tzing! bang! this soul is saved!\" \"Clang! clang! it isn't!\"\r\n  And _mich_ and _dich_ and _ich_ and _sich_ and _sisn't_!\r\n  Five dollar bills the nauseous treat secured,\r\n  But what can pay the public that endured?\r\n\r\n\"_March 17._ Before lying down for a needed rest, I must record the\r\nwonderful reception given to-day to Jack Elliott's ceiling.[134] The day\r\nwas fine, clear sunlight. Many friends congratulated me, and some\r\nstrangers. Vinton, the artist, Annie Blake, Ellen Dixey were\r\nenthusiastic in their commendation of the work, as were many others. I\r\nsaw my old friend, Lizzie Agassiz, my cousin Mary Robeson and her\r\ndaughter, and others too numerous to mention.... This I consider a day\r\nof great honor for my family.... _Deo gratias_ for this as well as for\r\nmy son's decoration.\"\r\n\r\n  [134] The Triumph of Time, at the Public Library.\r\n\r\n\"_March 31...._ Had a sort of vision in church of Moses and Christ, the\r\nmighty breath of the prophets reaching over many and dark ages to our\r\nown time, with power growing instead of diminishing. When I say a\r\nvision, I mean a vivid thought and mind picture.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 3._ Have writ to Larz Anderson, telling him where to find the\r\nquotation from Horace which I gave him for a motto to his automobile,\r\n'Ocior Euro.' Sanborn found it for me and sent it by postal. It must\r\nhave been more than thirty years since dear Brother Sam showed it to\r\nme....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 7._ A really inspired sermon from C. G. A., 'The power of an\r\nunending life.' ... The Communion which followed was to me almost\r\nmiraculous. Mr. Ames called it a festival of commemoration, and it\r\nbrought me a mind vision of the many departed dear ones. One after\r\nanother the dear forms seemed to paint themselves on my inner vision:\r\nfirst, the nearer in point of time, last my brother Henry and Samuel\r\nEliot. I felt that this experience ought to pledge me to new and more\r\nactive efforts to help others. In my mind I said, the obstacle to this\r\nis my natural inertia, my indolence; then the thought, God can overcome\r\nthis indolence and give me increased power of service and zeal for it.\r\nThose present, I think, all considered the sermon and Communion as of\r\nspecial power and interest. It almost made me fear lest it should prove\r\na swan song from the dear minister. Perhaps it is I, not he, who may\r\nsoon depart.\"\r\n\r\nLater in April she was able to fulfil some lecture engagements in New\r\nYork State with much enjoyment, but also much fatigue. After her return\r\nshe felt for a little while \"as if it was about time for her to go,\" but\r\nher mind soon recovered its tone.\r\n\r\nBeing gently reproved for giving a lecture and holding a reception on\r\nthe same day, she said, \"That is perfectly proper: I gave and I\r\nreceived: I was scriptural and I was blessed.\"\r\n\r\nAsked on another occasion if it did not tire her to lecture,--\"Why, no!\r\nit is they [the audience] who are tired, not I!\"\r\n\r\nOn April 27 she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I have had a great gratification to-day. Mrs. Fiske Warren had invited\r\nus to afternoon tea and to hear Coquelin deliver some monologues. I\r\nbethought me of my poem entitled 'After Hearing Coquelin.' Maud wrote to\r\nask Mrs. Warren whether she would like to have me read it and she\r\nassented. I procured a fresh copy of the volume in which it is\r\npublished, and took it with me to this party, which was large and _very_\r\nrepresentative of Boston's most recognized people. Miss Shedlock first\r\nmade a charming recitation in French, which she speaks perfectly. Then\r\nCoquelin gave three delightful monologues. The company then broke up for\r\ntea and I thought my chance was lost, but after a while order was\r\nrestored. M. Coquelin was placed where I could see him, and I read the\r\npoem as well as I could. He seemed much touched with the homage, and I\r\ngave him the book. People in general were pleased with the poem and I\r\nwas very glad and thankful for so pleasant an experience. Learned with\r\njoy of the birth of a son to my dear niece, Elizabeth Chapman.\"\r\n\r\nAnother happy birthday came and passed. After recording its friendly\r\nfestivities, she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I am _very_ grateful for all this loving kindness. Solemn thoughts must\r\ncome to me of the long past and of the dim, uncertain future. I trust\r\nGod for His grace. My life has been poor in merit, in comparison to what\r\nit should have been, but I am thankful that to some it has brought\r\ncomfort and encouragement, and that I have been permitted to champion\r\nsome good causes and to see a goodly number of my descendants, all well\r\nendowed physically and mentally, and starting in life with good\r\nprinciples and intentions; my children all esteemed and honored for\r\nhonorable service in their day and generation.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 30. Decoration Day...._ In the afternoon Maud and I drove out to\r\nMount Auburn to visit the dear graves. We took with us the best of the\r\nbirthday flowers, beautiful roses and lilies. I could not have much\r\nsense of the presence of our dear ones. Indeed, they are not there, but\r\nwhere they are, God only knows.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 31._ Free Religious meeting.... The fears which the bold programme\r\nhad naturally aroused in me, fears lest the dear Christ should be spoken\r\nof in a manner to wound those who love him--these fears were at once\r\ndissipated by the reverent tone of the several speakers....\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 1...._ To the Free Religious festival.... I found something to\r\nsay about the beautiful morning meeting and specially of the truth which\r\ncomes down to us, mixed with so much rubbish of tradition. I spoke of\r\nthe power of truth 'which burns all this accumulation of superstition\r\nand shines out firm and clear, so we may say that \"the myth crumbles but\r\nthe majesty remains.\"'...\"\r\n\r\nShe managed to do a good deal of writing this summer: wrote a number of\r\n\"screeds,\" some to order, some from inward leading: _e.g._, a paper on\r\n\"Girlhood Seventy Years Ago,\" a poem on the death of President McKinley.\r\n\r\n\"_October 5._ A package came to-day from McClure's Syndicate. I thought\r\nit was my manuscript returned and rejected, and said, 'God give me\r\nstrength not to cry.' I opened it and found a typewritten copy of my\r\npaper on 'Girlhood,' sent to me for correction in lieu of printer's\r\nproof. Wrote a little on my screed about 'Anarchy.' Had a sudden\r\nthought that the sense and spirit of government is responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 6...._ Wrote a poem on 'The Dead Century,' which has in it\r\nsome good lines, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 8._ The cook ill with rheumatism. I made my bed, turning the\r\nmattress, and put my room generally to rights. When I lay down to take\r\nmy usual _obligato_ rest, a fit of verse came upon me, and I had to\r\nabbreviate my lie-down to write out my _inspiration_.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"_obligato_ rest\"! How she did detest it! She recognized the\r\nnecessity of relaxing the tired nerves and muscles; she yielded, but\r\nnever willingly. The noon hour would find her bending over her desk,\r\nwriting \"for dear life,\" or plunged fathoms deep in Grote's \"Greece,\" or\r\nsome other light and playful work. Daughter or granddaughter would\r\nappear, watch in hand, countenance steeled against persuasion. \"Time for\r\nyour rest, dearest!\"\r\n\r\nThe rapt face looks up, breaks into sunshine, melts into entreaty. \"Let\r\nme finish this note, this page; then I will go!\" Or it may be the sprite\r\nthat looks out of the gray eyes. \"Get out!\" she says. \"Leave the room! I\r\nnever saw you before!\"\r\n\r\nFinally she submits to the indignity of being tucked in for her nap; but\r\neven then her watch is beside her on the bed, ticking away the minutes\r\ntill the half-hour is over, and she springs to her task.\r\n\r\n\"_November 3. 241 Beacon Street._ My room here has been nicely cleaned,\r\nbut I bring into it a great heap of books and papers. I am going to try\r\n_hard_ to be less disorderly than in the past.\"\r\n\r\nHow hard she did try, we well remember. The book trunk was a necessity\r\nof the summer flitting. It carried a full load from one book-ridden\r\nhouse to the other, and there were certain books--the four-volume Oxford\r\nBible, the big-print Horace, the Greek classics, shabby of dress,\r\nsplendid of type and margin--which could surely have found their way to\r\nand from Newport unaided.\r\n\r\nOne book she never asked for--the English dictionary! Once Maud,\r\nrecently returned from Europe, apologized for having inadvertently taken\r\nthe dictionary from 241 Beacon Street.\r\n\r\n\"How dreadful it was of me to take your dictionary! What have you done?\r\nDid you buy a new one?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know you had taken it!\"\r\n\r\n\"But--how did you get along without a dictionary?\"\r\n\r\nThe elder looked her surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I never use a word whose meaning I do not know!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the spelling?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to this, save a whimsical shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"_November 11._ The day of the celebration of dear Chev's one hundredth\r\nbirthday. Before starting for the Temple I received three beautiful\r\ngifts of flowers, a great bunch of white roses from Lizzie Agassiz, a\r\nlovely bouquet of violets from Mrs. Frank Batcheller, and some superb\r\nchrysanthemums from Mrs. George H. Perkins. The occasion was to me one\r\nof solemn joy and thankfulness. Senator Hoar presided with beautiful\r\ngrace, preluding with some lovely reminiscences of Dr. Howe's visit to\r\nhis office in Worcester, Massachusetts, when he, Hoar, was a young\r\nlawyer. Sanborn and Manatt excelled themselves, Humphreys did very well.\r\nHoar requested me to stand up and say a few words, which I did, he\r\nintroducing me in a very felicitous manner. I was glad to say my word,\r\nfor my heart was deeply touched. With me on the platform were my dear\r\nchildren and Jack Hall and Julia Richards; Anagnos, of course; the music\r\nvery good.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar's words come back to us to-day, and we see his radiant\r\nsmile as he led her forward.\r\n\r\n\"It is only the older ones among us,\" he said, \"who have seen Dr. Howe,\r\nbut there are hundreds here who will want to tell their children that\r\nthey have seen the author of the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic.'\"\r\n\r\nPart of her \"word\" was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"We have listened to-day to very heroic memories; it almost took away\r\nour breath to think that such things were done in the last century. I\r\nfeel very grateful to the pupils and graduates of the Perkins\r\nInstitution for the Blind who have planned this service in honor of my\r\nhusband. It is a story that should be told from age to age to show what\r\none good resolute believer in humanity was able to accomplish for the\r\nbenefit of his race.... The path by which he led Laura Bridgman to the\r\nlight has become one of the highways of education, and a number of\r\nchildren similarly afflicted are following it, to their endless\r\nenlargement and comfort. What an encouragement does this story give to\r\nthe undertaking of good deeds!\r\n\r\n\"I thank those who are with us to-day for their sympathy and attention.\r\nI do this, not in the name of a handful of dust, dear and reverend as it\r\nis, that now rests in Mount Auburn, but in the name of a great heart\r\nwhich is with us to-day and which will still abide with those who work\r\nin its spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 26. Thursday._ A day of pleasant agitation from beginning to\r\nend. I tried to recognize in thought the many mercies of the year. My\r\nfortunate recoveries from illness, the great pleasures of study,\r\nfriendly intercourse, thought and life generally. Our Thanksgiving\r\ndinner was at about 1.30 P.M., and was embellished by the traditional\r\nturkey, a fine one, to which David, Flossy, Maud, and I did justice. The\r\nRichards girls, Julia and Betty, and Chug[135] and Jack Hall, flitted in\r\nand out, full of preparation for the evening event, the marriage of my\r\ndear Harry Hall to Alice Haskell. I found time to go over my screed for\r\nMaynard very carefully, rewriting a little of it and mailing it in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n  [135] Dr. Lawrence J. Henderson.\r\n\r\n\"In the late afternoon came Harry Hall and his best man, Tom McCready,\r\nto dine here and dress for the ceremony. Maud improvised a pleasant\r\nsupper: we were eight at table. Went to the church in two carriages.\r\nBride looked very pretty, simple white satin dress and tulle veil. Six\r\nbridesmaids in pink, carrying white chrysanthemums. H. M. H.[136] seemed\r\nvery boyish, but looked charmingly....\"\r\n\r\n  [136] The bridegroom, Henry Marion Hall.\r\n\r\n\"_December 31._ The last day of a blessed year in which I have\r\nexperienced some physical suffering, but also many comforts and\r\nsatisfactions. I have had grippe and bronchitis in the winter and bad\r\nmalarial jaundice in the summer, but I have been constantly employed in\r\nwriting on themes of great interest and have had much of the society of\r\nchildren and grandchildren. Of these last, two are happily married,\r\n_i.e._, in great affection. My dear Maud and her husband have been with\r\nme constantly, and I have had little or no sense of loneliness....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of 1902 found her in better health than the previous year.\r\n\r\nShe records a luncheon with a distinguished company, at which all agreed\r\nthat \"the 'Atlantic' to-day would not accept Milton's 'L' Allegro,' nor\r\nwould any other magazine.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Symphony Concert \"the Tschaikowsky Symphony seemed to me to have\r\nin it more noise than music. Felt that I am too old to enjoy new music.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 24._ Suffrage and Anti-Suffrage at the State House. I went\r\nthere with all of my old interest in the Cause. The Antis were there in\r\nforce: Mrs. Charles Guild as their leader; Lawyer Russell as their\r\nmanager. I had to open. I felt so warm in my faith that for once I\r\nthought I might convert our opponents. I said much less than I had\r\nintended, as is usually the case with me when I speak _extempore_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 7...._ I went to see Leoni's wonderful illuminated\r\nrepresentation of leading events in our history; a very remarkable work,\r\nand one which ought to remain in this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 11._ Dreamed of an interview with a female pope. I had to go\r\nto Alliance Meeting to speak about Wordsworth. I hunted up some verses\r\nwritten about him in my early enthusiasm, probably in 1840 or 1841. This\r\nI read and then told of my visit to him with Dr. Howe and the\r\nunpleasantness of the experience. Spoke also of the reaction in England\r\nagainst the morbid discontent which is so prominent and powerful in much\r\nof Byron's poetry....\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 12...._ In my dream of yesterday morning the woman pope and I\r\nwere on very friendly terms. I asked on leaving whether I might kiss her\r\nhand. She said, 'You may kiss my hand.' I found it fat and far from\r\nbeautiful. As I left her, methought that her countenance relaxed and she\r\nlooked like a tired old woman. In my dream I thought, 'How like this is\r\nto what Pope Leo would do.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 13...._ Felt greatly discouraged at first waking. It seemed\r\nimpossible for me to make a first move under so many responsibilities. A\r\nsudden light came into my soul at the thought that God will help me in\r\nany good undertaking, and with this there came an inkling of first steps\r\nto be taken with regard to Sig. Leoni's parchment.[137] I went to work\r\nagain on my prize poem, with better success than hitherto....\"\r\n\r\n  [137] That is, to have it bought by some public society.\r\n\r\n\"_February 14._ Philosophy at Mrs. Bullard's.... Sent off my prize poem\r\nwith scarcely any hope of its obtaining or indeed deserving the prize,\r\nbut Mar[138] has promised to pay me something for it in any case, and I\r\nwas bound to try for the object, namely, a good civic poem....\"\r\n\r\n  [138] An editor.\r\n\r\n\"_February 15...._ A day of great pleasure, profit and fatigue....\r\nGriggs's lecture.... The address on 'Erasmus and Luther' was very\r\ninspiring. Griggs is in the full tide of youthful inspiration and gives\r\nhimself to his audience without stint. He did not quite do justice to\r\nthe wonderful emancipation of thought which Protestantism has brought to\r\nthe world, but his illustration of the two characters was masterly. I\r\nsaid afterwards to Fanny Ames: 'He will burn himself out.' She thinks\r\nthat he is wisely conservative of his physical strength. I said, 'He\r\nbleeds at every pore.' I used to say this of myself with regard to\r\nordinary social life. Went to the Club, where was made to preside. Todd\r\nand Todkinee[139] both spoke excellently. Then to Symphony Concert to\r\nhear Kreisler and the 'Pastoral Symphony.'\"\r\n\r\n  [139] Professor Todd, of Amherst, and his wife, Mabel Loomis Todd.\r\n\r\n\"_February 16...._ The Philosophy meeting and Griggs's lecture revived\r\nin me the remembrance of my philosophic studies and attempts of\r\nthirty-five years ago, and I determined to endeavor to revise them and\r\nto publish them in some shape. Have thought a good deal this morning of\r\nthis cream of genius in which the fervent heat of youth fuses conviction\r\nand imagination and gives the world its great masters and masterpieces.\r\nIt cannot outlast the length of human life of which it is the poetry.\r\nAge follows it with slow philosophy, but can only strengthen the\r\noutposts which youth has gained with daring flight. Both are divinely\r\nordained and most blessed. Of the dear Christ the world had only this\r\ntranscendent efflorescence. I said to Ames yesterday, 'I find in the\r\nHebrew prophets all the doctrine which I find in Christ's teaching.' He\r\nsaid, 'Yes, it is there seminally.' We agreed that it was the life which\r\nmade the difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 21_.... My dearest Maud left by 1 P.M. train to sail for\r\nEurope to-morrow. I could not go to the hearing. Was on hand to think of\r\nsmall details which might have been overlooked. Gave them my fountain\r\npen, to Jack's great pleasure. Julia Richards came to take care of me. I\r\nsuffered extreme depression in coming back to the empty house, every\r\ncorner of which is so identified with Maud's sweet and powerful\r\npresence. The pain of losing her, even for a short time, seemed\r\nintolerable. I was better in the evening. Chug amused me with a game of\r\npicquet.\"\r\n\r\nHer spirits soon rallied, and the granddaughters did their best to fill\r\nthe great void. She writes to Laura about this time:--\r\n\r\n  Not a sign was made, not a note was wrote,\r\n  Not a telegram was wired,\r\n  Not a rooster sent up his warning note,\r\n  When the eggs from your larder were fired.\r\n\r\n  We swallow them darkly at break of fast,\r\n  Each one to the other winking,\r\n  And \"woe is me if this be the last\"\r\n  Is what we are sadly thinking.\r\n\r\n  The egg on missile errand sent\r\n  Some time has been maturing,\r\n  And, with whate'er endearment blent,\r\n  Is rarely reassuring.\r\n\r\n  But yours, which in their freshness came\r\n  Just when they might be wanted,\r\n  A message brought without a name,\r\n  \"Love,\" we will take for granted.    [_Copyrighted._]\r\n\r\nJulia is rather strict with me, but very good, considering whose\r\ngrandchild she is.\r\n\r\n                                Affect.,\r\n                                                        MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\"_March 25._ I received in one day three notes asking me regarding the\r\n'Life of Margaret Shepard,' and 'Secret Confessions of a Priest.' One\r\nwriter had seen in some paper that she could have the books by applying\r\nto me; Miss ---- wrote to the same intent; Miss ---- wrote and enclosed\r\nforty cents' worth of stamps for one of the books. I have replied to all\r\nthat I know nothing of the books in question, and that I am neither\r\nagent nor bookseller.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 30._ Lunch with Mrs. Fields after church. Heard a very inspiring\r\nsermon from Samuel A. Eliot. This young man has a very noble bearing and\r\na stringent way of presenting truth. He has that vital religious power\r\nwhich is rare and most precious. Before he had spoken I had been asking\r\nin my mind, how can we make the _past present to us_? The Easter service\r\nand Lent also seem intended to do this, but our imaginations droop and\r\nlag behind our desires....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 2._... Went in the evening to see 'Ben-Hur' with kind Sarah\r\nJewett--her treat, as was my attendance at the opera. The play was\r\naltogether spectacular, but very good in that line....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 3._... Went to the celebration of E. E. Hale's eightieth\r\nbirthday, in which the community largely participated. Senator Hoar was\r\nthe orator and spoke finely.... Hale's response was manly, cheery, and\r\ndevout. He has certainly done much good work, and has suggested many\r\ngood things.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 12._ Lunch with Mrs. Wheelwright. I found Agnes Repplier very\r\nagreeable. She had known the wife of Green, the historian, 'very, almost\r\ntoo brilliant.' Told me something about his life. I enjoyed meeting\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _To Laura_\r\n\r\nYes, I likes my chilluns better 'n other folkses' chilluns. P'raps 'tis\r\nas well sometimes to let them know that I do....\r\n\r\nWhat you write about my little Memoir of your dear Papa touches me a\r\ngood deal. I did my best to make it as satisfactory as the limits\r\nimposed upon me would allow. I don't think that I ever had a word of\r\ncommendation for it. Michael killed it as a book by printing it entire\r\nin his Report for the year. Now I am much gratified by your notice of\r\nit. You are most welcome to use it in connection with the letters.[140]\r\n\r\n  [140] Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_May 16._ In the evening the Italian supper at the Hotel Piscopo, North\r\nEnd. I recited Goldoni's toast from the 'Locandiera,' and also made a\r\nlittle speech at the end of the banquet. Padre Roberto, a Venetian\r\npriest, young and handsome, sat near me....\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 18_.... I had prayed that this might be a real Whitsunday to me\r\nand I felt that it was. Notice was given of a meeting at which Catholic,\r\nJew, Episcopalian, and Unitarian are to speak regarding the Filipinos.\r\nThis seemed like the Millennium. It is the enlargement of religious\r\nsympathy; not, as some may think, the progress of critical\r\nindifferentism.\r\n\r\n\"During this morning's service my desire to speak to prisoners\r\nreasserted itself strongly; also my thought of one of my sermons which I\r\nwish to write. One should be to the text: 'The glory of God in the face\r\nof Jesus Christ,' the reflection of divine glory in God's saints, like\r\nthe reflection of the sun's light in the planets. Another about Adam\r\nbeing placed in Eden to tend the flowers and water them. This should\r\nconcern our office in the land of our birth, into which we are born to\r\nlove and serve our country. Will speak of the self-banished Americans,\r\nHale's 'Man without a Country,' etc. This day has been so full of\r\nthought and suggestion that I hardly know how to let it go. I pray that\r\nit may bear some fruit in my life, what is left of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 24._ The annual Club luncheon in honor of my birthday. I felt\r\nalmost overwhelmed by the great attention shown me and by the constant\r\ntalk of speakers with reference to myself.... I don't find in myself\r\nthis charm, this goodness, attributed to me by such speakers, but I know\r\nthat I love the Club and love the world of my own time, so far as I know\r\nit. They called me Queen and kissed my hand. When I came home I fell in\r\nspirit before the feet of the dear God, thanking Him for the regard\r\nshown me, and praying that it might not for one moment make me vain. I\r\nread my translation of Horace's ode, 'Quis Desiderio,' and it really\r\nseemed to suit the mention made by Mrs. Cheney of our departed members,\r\n_praecipuë_, Dr. Zack; Dr. Hoder [?] of England was there, and\r\nex-Governor Long and T. W. Higginson, also Agnes Irwin. It was a great\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 5_.... I wrote to Ethel V. Partridge, Omaha, a high-school\r\nstudent: 'Get all the education that you can. Cultivate habits of\r\nstudious thought with all that books can teach. The fulfilment of the\r\nnearest duty gives the best education.' I fear that I have come to know\r\nthis by doing the exact opposite, _i.e._, neglecting much of the nearest\r\nduty in the pursuit of an intellectual wisdom which I have not\r\nattained....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMaud and Florence were both away in the early part of this summer, and\r\nvarious grandchildren kept her company at Oak Glen. There were other\r\nvisitors, among them Count Salome di Campello, a cheery guest who cooked\r\nspaghetti for her, and helped the granddaughter to set off the Fourth of\r\nJuly fireworks, to her equal pleasure and terror. During his visit she\r\ninvited the Italian Ambassador[141] to spend a couple of days at Oak\r\nGlen. On July 14 she writes:--\r\n\r\n  [141] Count Mayer des Planches.\r\n\r\n\"Not having heard from the Italian Ambassador, the Count and I supposed\r\nthat he was not coming. In the late afternoon came a letter saying that\r\nhe would arrive to-morrow. We were troubled at this late intelligence,\r\nwhich gave me no time to invite people to meet the guest. I lay down for\r\nmy afternoon rest with a very uneasy mind. Remembering St. Paul's words\r\nabout 'Angels unawares,' I felt comforted, thinking that the Angel of\r\nHospitality would certainly visit me, whether the guest proved congenial\r\nor not.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 15_.... The Ambassador arrived as previously announced. He proved\r\na most genial and charming person; a man still in the prime of life,\r\nwith exquisite manners, as much at home in our simplicity as he\r\ndoubtless is in scenes of luxury and magnificence. Daisy Chanler drove\r\nout for afternoon tea, at my request, and made herself charming. After\r\nher came Emily Ladenberg, who also made a pleasing impression. Our guest\r\nplayed on the piano and joined in our evening whist. We were all\r\ndelighted with him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Ambassador's departure she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"He gave me an interesting account of King Charles Albert of Savoia. He\r\nis a man of powerful temperament, which we all felt; has had to do with\r\nBismarck and Salisbury and all the great European politicians of his\r\ntime. We were all sorry to see him depart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Journal tells of many pleasures, among them \"a delightful morning in\r\nthe green parlor with Margaret Deland and dear Maud.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 24 she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"This day has been devoted to a family function of great interest,\r\nnamely, the christening of Daisy and Wintie's boy baby, Theodore Ward,\r\nthe President[142] himself standing godfather. Jack Elliott and I were\r\non hand in good time, both of us in our best attire. We found a very\r\nchosen company, the Sydney Websters, Owen Wister, Senator Lodge and\r\nwife, the latter standing as godmother. Mr. Diman, of the School,[143]\r\nofficiated, Parson Stone being ill. The President made his response\r\nquite audibly. The Chanler children looked lovely, and the baby as dear\r\nas a baby can look. His godfather gave him a beautiful silver bowl lined\r\nwith gold. I gave a silver porringer, Maud a rattle with silver bells;\r\nlunch followed. President Roosevelt took me in to the table and seated\r\nme on his right. This was a very distinguished honor. The conversation\r\nwas rather literary. The President admires Emerson's poems, and also\r\nLongfellow and Sienkiewicz. He paid me the compliment of saying that\r\nKipling alone had understood the meaning of my 'Battle Hymn,' and that\r\nhe admired him therefor. Wister proposed the baby's health, and I\r\nrecited a quatrain which came to me early this morning. Here it is:--\r\n\r\n  \"Roses are the gift of God,\r\n  Laurels are the gift of fame;\r\n  Add the beauty of thy life\r\n  To the glory of thy name.\"\r\n\r\n  [142] Theodore Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n  [143] St. George's, Newport.\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'Two lines for the President and two for the baby'; the two\r\nfirst naturally for the President. As I sat waiting for the ceremony, I\r\ncalled the dear roll of memory, Uncle Sam and so on back to Grandpa\r\nWard. I was very thankful to participate in this beautiful occasion. But\r\nthe service and talk about the baby's being born in sin, etc., etc.,\r\nseemed to me very inconsistent with Christ's saying that he who would\r\nenter into the Kingdom of Heaven must become 'as a little child.' He\r\nalso said, 'of such is the kingdom of heaven.'\"\r\n\r\nShe had a high admiration for Colonel Roosevelt, and a regard so warm\r\nthat she would never allow any adverse criticism of him in her presence.\r\nThe following verses express this feeling:--\r\n\r\n  Here's to Teddy,\r\n  Blythe and ready,\r\n  Fit for each occasion!\r\n  Who as he\r\n  Acceptably\r\n  Can represent the Nation?\r\n\r\n  Neither ocean\r\n  Binds his motion,\r\n  Undismayed explorer;\r\n  Challenge dares him,\r\n  Pullman bears him\r\n  Swifter than Aurora.\r\n\r\n  Here's to Teddy!\r\n  Let no eddy\r\n  Block the onward current.\r\n  Him we trust,\r\n  And guard we must\r\n  From schemes to sight abhorrent.\r\n\r\n  When the tuba\r\n  Called to Cuba\r\n  Where the fight was raging,\r\n  Rough and ready\r\n  Riders led he,\r\n  Valorous warfare waging.\r\n\r\n  Here's to Teddy!\r\n  Safe and steady,\r\n  Loved by every section!\r\n  South and North\r\n  Will hurry forth\r\n  To hasten his election.\r\n\r\n                                   1904.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, a notice of the death of William Allen Butler is pasted\r\nin the Diary. Below it she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"A pleasant man. I met him at the Hazeltines' in Rome in 1898 and 1899.\r\nHis poem [\"Nothing to Wear\"] was claimed by one or two people. I met his\r\nfather [a Cabinet Minister] at a dinner at the Bancrofts' in New York,\r\nat which ex-President Van Buren was also present, and W. M. Thackeray,\r\nwho said to me across the table that Browning's 'How They Brought the\r\nGood News' was a 'good jingle.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th she spoke at a meeting of the New England Woman's Club in\r\nmemory of Dr. Zakrzewska, and records her final words:--\r\n\r\n\"I pray God earnestly that we women may never go back from the ground\r\nwhich has been gained for us by our noble pioneers and leaders. I pray\r\nthat these bright stars of merit, set in our human firmament, may shine\r\nupon us and lead us to better and better love and service for God and\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon, to hear reports of delegates to Biennial at Los\r\nAngeles. These were very interesting, but the activity shown made me\r\nfeel my age, and its one great infirmity, loss of power of locomotion. I\r\nfelt somehow the truth of the line which Mr. Robert C. Winthrop once\r\nquoted to me:--\r\n\r\n  \"'Superfluous lags the veteran on the stage.'\"\r\n\r\nYet a few days later she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I had this morning so strong a feeling of the goodness of the divine\r\nParent in the experience of my life, especially of its most trying\r\nperiod, that I had to cry out, 'What shall I, who have received so much,\r\ngive in return?' I felt that I must only show that forbearance and\r\nforgiveness to others which the ever blessed One has shown to me. My own\r\nfamily does not call for this. I am cherished by its members with great\r\ntenderness and regard. I thought later in the day of a sermon to\r\nprisoners which would brighten their thoughts of the love of God. Text\r\nfrom St. John's Epistle, 'Behold what manner of love is this that we\r\nshould be called the sons of God.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was the year of the coal strike in Pennsylvania, which made much\r\ntrouble in Boston. She notes one Sunday that service at the Church of\r\nthe Disciples was held in the church parlors \"on account of the shortage\r\nof coal.\" This recalls vivid pictures of the time; distracted coal\r\nmerchants dealing out promises, with nothing else to deal; portly\r\nmagnates and stately dames driving down Beacon Street in triumph with\r\ncoals in a paper bag to replenish the parlor fire: darker pictures, too,\r\nof poverty and suffering.\r\n\r\nAt 241 Beacon Street the supply was running low, and the coal dealer was\r\nsummoned by telephone. \"A load of coal? Impossible, madam! We have no--I\r\nbeg your pardon! Mrs. Julia Ward Howe? _Mrs. Howe's house is cold?_ You\r\nshall have some within the hour!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLOOKING TOWARD SUNSET\r\n\r\n1903-1905; _aet._ 84-86\r\n\r\nIN MUSIC HALL\r\n\r\n_Looking down upon the white heads of my contemporaries_\r\n\r\n  Beneath what mound of snow\r\n  Are hid my springtime roses?\r\n  How shall Remembrance know\r\n  Where buried Hope reposes?\r\n\r\n  In what forgetful heart\r\n  As in a cañon darkling,\r\n  Slumbers the blissful art\r\n  That set my heaven sparkling?\r\n\r\n  What sense shall never know,\r\n  Soul shall remember;\r\n  Roses beneath the snow,\r\n  June in November.\r\n\r\n                                         J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1903 began with the celebration at Faneuil Hall of the fortieth\r\nanniversary of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. She was one of the\r\nspeakers. \"I felt much the spirit of the occasion, and spoke, I thought,\r\nbetter than usual, going back to the heroic times before and during the\r\nwar, and to the first celebration forty years ago, at which I was\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\nWork of all kinds poured in, the usual steady stream.\r\n\r\n\"_January 6._ Wrote a new circular for Countess.\"\r\n\r\nWho the Countess was, or what the circular was about, is not known. By\r\nthis time it had become the custom (or so it seemed to exasperated\r\ndaughters and granddaughters) for any one who wanted anything in the\r\nliterary line, from a proverb to a pamphlet, to ask her for it.\r\n\r\nIt is remembered how on a certain evening, when she was resting after a\r\nweary day, a \"special delivery\" note was received from a person whom she\r\nscarcely knew, asking for \"her thoughts on the personality of God, by\r\nreturn mail.\" This was one of the few requests she ever denied. People\r\nasked her to give them material for their club papers (sometimes to\r\nwrite them!), to put them through college, to read their manuscripts, to\r\npay the funeral expenses of their relatives. A volume of the letters\r\nconveying these requests would be curious reading.\r\n\r\nThe petition for a \"little verse\" was rarely refused. Her notebooks are\r\nfull of occasional poems, only a small proportion of which ever appeared\r\nin print. Many of them are \"autographs.\" She always meant to honor every\r\nrequest of this kind; the country must be full of volumes inscribed by\r\nher. Here are a few of them.\r\n\r\n_For Francis C. Stokes, Westtown School, Pennsylvania_\r\n\r\n  Auspicious be the rule\r\n  Of love at Westtown School,\r\n  And happy, mid his youthful folks\r\n  The daily task of Master Stokes!\r\n\r\n[When this gentleman's note came, she was \"tired to death.\" The\r\ngranddaughter said, \"You _can't_ do it. Let me write a friendly note,\r\nand you shall sign it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" she said, \"I can't: I am too tired to think!\" But when\r\nshe saw the note taken away, \"No, no!\" she cried, \"I can! He is probably\r\na most hard-working man, and a little word may cheer him. Here, I have\r\na line already!\"]\r\n\r\n     Wealth is good, health is better, character is best.\r\n\r\n  Citizens of the new world,\r\n  Children of the promise,\r\n  So let us live!\r\n\r\n  Love to learn, and learn to love.\r\n\r\n     Remember to forget your troubles, but don't forget to remember your\r\n     blessings.\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Charles Gallup, who had written to her several times without\r\nreceiving a reply, she wrote--\r\n\r\n  If one by name Gallup\r\n  Desires to wallop\r\n  A friend who too slowly responds,\r\n  She will plead that her age\r\n  Has attained such a stage\r\n  She is held hand and foot in its bonds.\r\n\r\nHere, again, are a few sentences, gathered from various calendars.\r\n\r\n     The little girls on the school bench, using or misusing their\r\n     weekly allowance, are learning to build their future house, or\r\n     pluck it down.\r\n\r\n     No gift can make rich those who are poor in wisdom.\r\n\r\n     In whatever you may undertake, never sacrifice quality for\r\n     quantity, even when quantity pays and quality does not.\r\n\r\n     For so long, the body can perform its functions and hold together,\r\n     but what term is set for the soul? Nothing in its make-up\r\n     foretokens a limited existence. Its sentence would seem to be,\r\n     \"Once and always.\"\r\n\r\nThe verses in the notebooks are by no means all \"by request.\" The\r\nrhyming fit might seize her anywhere, at any time. She wrote the rough\r\ndraft on whatever was at hand, often on the back of note, circular, or\r\nnewspaper wrapper. She could never forget the war-time days when paper\r\ncost half a dollar a pound.\r\n\r\nNor were people content with writing: they came singly, in pairs, in\r\ngroups, to proffer requests, to pay respects, to ask counsel. The only\r\npeople she met unwillingly were those who came to bewail their lot and\r\ndemand her sympathy.\r\n\r\nNo one will ever know the number of her benefactions. They were mostly,\r\nof necessity, small, yet we must think they went a long way. At the New\r\nEngland Woman's Club, whenever a good new cause came up, she would say,\r\n\"I will start the subscription with a dollar!\" Many noble and enduring\r\nthings began with the \"President's dollar.\" If she had had a hundred\r\ndollars to give, it would have been joyfully given: if she had had but\r\nten cents, it would not have been withheld. She had none of the false\r\npride which shrinks from giving a small sum.\r\n\r\nBeggars and tramps were tenderly dealt with. A discharged criminal in\r\nparticular must never be refused help. Work must be found for him if\r\npossible; if not, it is to be feared that he got a dollar, \"to help him\r\nfind work\"!\r\n\r\n\"_January 10._ At 11.30 received message from 'New York World' that it\r\nwould pay for an article sent at once on 'Gambling among Society\r\nPeople.' Wrote this in a little more than an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 20...._ Some little agitation about my appearance at the\r\nArtists' Festival to-night, as one of the patronesses. I had already a\r\nwhite woollen dress quite suitable for the prescribed costume. Some\r\nbenevolent person or persons ordered for me and sent a cloak of fine\r\nwhite cloth, beautiful to look at but heavy to wear. A headdress was\r\nimprovised out of one of my Breton caps, with a long veil of lawn. Jack\r\nElliott made me a lovely coronet out of a bit of gold braid with one\r\njewel of dear Maud's. Arriving, to my surprise, I found the Queen's\r\nchair waiting for me. I sat thereon very still, the other patronesses\r\nbeing most kind and cordial, and saw the motley throng and the curious\r\npageants. Costumes most beautiful, but the hall too small for much\r\nindividual effect. Adèle Thayer wore the famous Thayer diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 27._ Woke early and began to worry about the hearing....\r\nDressed with more care than usual and went betimes to State House. Had a\r\ngood deliverance of my paper. The opposition harped upon our bill as an\r\neffort to obtain class legislation, saying also that they knew it to be\r\nan entering wedge to obtain suffrage for all women; the two positions\r\nbeing evidently irreconcilable. When our turn for rebuttal came, I said:\r\n'Many years ago John Quincy Adams presented in Congress a petition for\r\nthe abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, but none of the\r\nSoutherners imagined that this petition was intended to keep the other\r\nnegroes of the South in slavery! Are we, who, for thirty years past, and\r\nmore, have been coming here to ask for full suffrage for all women, to\r\nbe accused of coming here now with a view to the exclusion of our former\r\nclients from suffrage? How can we be said to contemplate this and at the\r\nsame time to be putting in an entering wedge for universal suffrage?'\r\n\r\n\"I thank God for what I did say at the hearing and for what I did not\r\nsay. Two of the opposing speakers were rude in their remarks; all were\r\nabsurd, hunting an issue which they knew to be false, namely, our\r\nseeking for class legislation.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 28._ Although very tired after yesterday's meeting, I went in\r\nthe evening to see 'Julius Cæsar' in Richard Mansfield's interpretation.\r\nThe play was beautifully staged; Mansfield very good in the tent scene;\r\nparts generally well filled....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 3._ My dear Maud returned this evening from New York. She has\r\nbeen asked to speak at to-morrow's suffrage hearing. I advised her to\r\nreflect before embarking upon this new voyage.... When she told me what\r\nshe had in mind to say, I felt that a real word had been given her. I\r\nsaid: 'Go and say that!'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 1...._ A telegram announced the birth of my first\r\ngreat-grandchild, Harry Hall's infant daughter.[144]...\"\r\n\r\n  [144] Julia Ward Howe Hall.\r\n\r\n\"_April 11._ To Mrs. Bigelow Lawrence's, Parker House, to hear music.\r\nMrs. [Henry] Whitman called for me.\r\n\r\n\"Delightful music; two quartettes of Beethoven's, a quintette of\r\nMozart's, which I heard at Joseph Coolidge's some thirty or more years\r\nago. I recognized it by the first movement, which Bellini borrowed in a\r\nsextette which I studied in my youth from 'La Straniera,' an opera never\r\ngiven in these days....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 17._ Winchendon lecture.... A day of anguish for me. I was\r\nabout to start for Winchendon when my dearest Maud so earnestly besought\r\nme not to go, the weather being very threatening, that I _could not_\r\ndeny her. Words can hardly say how I suffered in giving up the trip and\r\ndisappointing so many people.... As I lay taking my afternoon rest, my\r\nheart said to God, 'You cannot help me in this'; but He did help me, for\r\nI was able soon after this to interest myself in things at hand. I heard\r\nMabilleau's lecture on French art in its recent departure. It was\r\nbrilliant and forcibly stated, but disappointing. He quoted with\r\nadmiration Baudelaire's hideous poem, 'Un Carogne.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 21._ In the afternoon attended anniversary of the Blind\r\nKindergarten, where I made, as usual, a brief address, beginning with\r\n'God said, Let there be light,' a sentence which makes itself felt\r\nthroughout the human domain, where great-hearted men are stirred by it\r\nto combat the spirits of darkness. Spoke also of the culture of the\r\nblind as vindicating the dignity of the human mind, which can become a\r\nvalue and a power despite the loss of outward sense. Alluded to dear\r\nChev's sense of this and his resolve that the blind, from being simply a\r\nburden, should become of value to the community. The care of them draws\r\nforth tender sympathy in those whose office it is to cherish and\r\ninstruct them. Spoke of the nursery as one of the dearest of human\r\ninstitutions. Commended the little blind nursery to the affectionate\r\nregard of seeing people. The children did exceedingly well, especially\r\nthe orchestra. The little blind 'cellist was remarkable.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 2._ Dreamed last night that I was dead and kept saying, 'I found\r\nit out immediately,' to those around me....\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 28._ My prayer for the new year of my life beginning to-day is,\r\nthat in some work that I shall undertake I may help to make clear the\r\ngoodness of God to some who need to know more of it than they do....\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 22._ Mabel Loomis Todd wrote asking me for a word to enclose in\r\nthe corner-stone of the new observatory building at Amherst\r\n[Massachusetts]. I have just sent her the following:--\r\n\r\n  \"The stars against the tyrant fought\r\n  In famous days of old;\r\n  The stars in freedom's banner wrought\r\n  Shall the wide earth enfold.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 23._ Kept within doors by the damp weather. Read in William\r\nJames's book, 'Varieties of Religious Experience.'... Had a strange\r\nfatigue--a restlessness in my brain.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 25...._ The James book which I finished yesterday left in my mind\r\na painful impression of doubt; a God who should be only my better self,\r\nor an impersonal pervading influence. These were suggestions which left\r\nme very lonely and forlorn. To-day, as I thought it all over, the God of\r\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob seemed to come back to me; the God of Christ,\r\nand his saints and martyrs. I said to myself: 'Let me be steeped in the\r\ndevotion of the Psalms, and of Paul's Epistles!' I took up Coquerel's\r\nsermons on the Lord's Prayer, simple, beautiful, positive....\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 30._ _Oak Glen._ Rose at 6.15 A.M. and had good luck in dressing\r\nquickly. With dear Flossy took 9 A.M. train for Boston. At Middletown\r\nstation found the teachers from the West [Denver and Iowa], who started\r\nthe 'Battle Hymn' when they saw me approaching. This seemed to me\r\ncharming. My man Michael, recognizing the tune, said: 'Mrs. Howe, this\r\nis a send-off for you!'...\"\r\n\r\nShe was going to keep a lecture engagement in Concord, Massachusetts;\r\nher theme, \"A Century from the Birth of Emerson.\" She was anxious about\r\nthis paper, and told Mr. Sanborn (the inevitable reporter calling to\r\nborrow her manuscript) that she thought the less said about the address\r\nthe better. \"I have tried very hard to say the right thing, but doubt\r\nwhether I have succeeded.\" Spite of these doubts, the lecture was\r\nreceived with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"_September 6._ I was very dull at waking and dreaded the drive to\r\nchurch and the stay to Communion. The drive partly dissipated my\r\n'megrims'; every bright object seemed to me to praise God.... The\r\nCommunion service was very comforting. Especially did Christ's words\r\ncome to me, 'Abide in me,' etc. I felt that if I would abide in Him, old\r\nas I am, I could still do some good work. 'Yes! my strong friend,' my\r\nheart said, 'I will abide in thee,' and a bit of the old Easter anthem\r\ncame back to me, 'He sitteth at the right hand of God, in the glory of\r\nthe Father.' No, it is a verse of the _Te Deum_.\"\r\n\r\nIn October a lecture in South Berwick gave her the opportunity, always\r\ngreatly enjoyed, of a visit to Sarah Orne Jewett and her sister Mary.\r\n\r\n\"_November 1._ _South Berwick._ A delightful drive. Mary Jewett, Annie\r\nFields, and I to visit Mrs. Tyson in the Hamilton House described by\r\nSarah in her 'Tory Lover.'... Most interesting. Mrs. Tyson very cordial\r\nand delightful.... She came over later to dinner and we had such a\r\npleasant time! In afternoon copied most of my screed for the 'Boston\r\nGlobe.'\"\r\n\r\nIt surely was not on this occasion that she described dinner as \"a thing\r\nof courses and remorses!\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 2._ Took reluctant leave of the Jewett house and the trio,\r\nSarah, Mary, and Annie Fields. We had a wonderful dish of pigeons for\r\nlunch....\"\r\n\r\nIt was delightful to see our mother and Miss Jewett together. They were\r\nthe best of playmates, having a lovely intimacy of understanding. Their\r\ntalk rippled with light and laughter. Such stories as they told! such\r\nsongs as they sang! who that heard will ever forget our mother's story\r\nof Edward Everett in his youth? He was to take three young ladies to\r\ndrive, and had but the one horse; he wished to please them all equally.\r\nTo the first he said, \"The horse is perfectly fresh now; you have him in\r\nhis best condition.\" To the second he said, \"The horse was a little\r\nantic at first, so you will have the safer drive.\" To the third he said,\r\n\"Now that the other two have had their turn, we need not hasten back.\r\nYou can have the longest drive.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recalled that during this visit, when Laura felt bound to\r\nremonstrate in the matter of fruitcake, \"Sarah\" took sides with ardor.\r\n\"You shall have all you want, Mrs. Howe, and a good big piece to take\r\nhome besides! Put it somewhere where the girls can't find it!\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"There is a corner in my closet, which even Maud dare not\r\nexplore!\"\r\n\r\nThe fruitcake was duly packed, transported, and eaten--we are bound to\r\nsay without ill effect.\r\n\r\nThis recalls the day when, leaving Gardiner, she was presented with a\r\npacket of sandwiches, and charged to have the Pullman porter bring her a\r\ncup of bouillon. The next day Laura received a postal card.\r\n\r\n\"Lunched at Portland on mince pie, which agreed with me excellently,\r\nthank you!\"\r\n\r\nHer postal cards were better than most people's letters. You could\r\nalmost see them sparkle. The signature would be \"Town Pump\" or something\r\nequally luminous. In fact, she so rarely signed her own name in writing\r\nto us that when asked for autographs we were posed. \"Town Pump\" was no\r\nautograph for the author of the \"Battle Hymn\"!\r\n\r\nThere was another mince pie, a little, pretty one, which she saw at a\r\nPapéterie meeting, the last summer of her life; saw, coveted, secreted,\r\nwith her hostess's aid, and smuggled home. Always a moderate eater, she\r\nnever could be made to see that age demanded a careful diet. \"I have\r\neaten sausages all my life,\" she would say. \"They have always agreed\r\nwith me perfectly!\" Indeed, till the very latest years, her digestion\r\nhad never failed her. It was in the eighties that she said to one of us,\r\n\"I have a singular sensation that I have never felt before. Do you think\r\nit might possibly be indigestion?\" She described it, and it _was_\r\nindigestion. We are reminded of a contemporary of hers who, being\r\ngently rebuked for giving rich food to a delicate grandchild, replied\r\nwith lofty scorn, \"Stuff and nonsense! _Teach his stomach!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 8...._ In late afternoon some visioning, _i.e._, lying down\r\nto rest and asking and answering questions in my mind:--\r\n\r\n\"Question: Can anything exceed the delight of the first mutual\r\nunderstanding of two lovers?\r\n\r\n\"Answer: This has its sacredness and its place, but even better is the\r\nlarge affection which embraces things human and divine, God and man.\r\n\r\n\"Question: Are Saviour and Saints alive now?\r\n\r\n\"Answer: If you believe that God is just, they must be. They gave all\r\nfor His truth: He owes them immortality.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 16._ Dear Auntie Francis's wedding day. I think it was in\r\n1828. My sisters and I were bridesmaids, my brothers groomsmen. Dear\r\nfather, very lame, walked up with a cane to give her away. Grandma\r\nCutler looked much discontented with the match. Father sent the pair off\r\nin his own carriage, with four horses, their manes and tails braided\r\nwith white ribbons. They drove part of the way to Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 28...._ To Wellesley College.... William Butler Yeats\r\nlectured on the revival of letters in Ireland. We dined with him\r\nafterwards at Miss Hazard's house. He is a man of fiery temperament,\r\nwith a slight, boyish figure: has deep-set blue eyes and dark hair;\r\nreminds me of John O'Sullivan[145] in his temperament; is certainly, as\r\nGrandpa Ward said of the Red Revolutionists, with whom he dined in the\r\ndays of the French Revolution, 'very warm.'\"\r\n\r\n  [145] Hawthorne's friend of the _Democratic Review_.\r\n\r\n\"_November 29...._ This came into my mind, apropos of reformers\r\ngenerally: 'Dost thou so carry thy light as to throw it upon _thyself_,\r\nor upon thy _theme_?' This appears to me a legitimate question....\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 21._ Put the last touches to my verses for Colonel\r\nHigginson's eightieth birthday. Maud went with me to the celebration\r\nheld by the Boston Authors' Club at the Colonial Club, Cambridge. T. W.\r\nH. seemed in excellent condition; I presided as usual. Bliss Perry,\r\nfirst speaker, came rather late, but made a very good address. Crothers\r\nand Dean Hodges followed, also Clement. Judge Grant read a simple,\r\nstrong poem, _very good_, I thought. Then came my jingle, intended to\r\nrelieve the strain of the occasion, which I think it did. Maud says that\r\nI hit the bull's eye; perhaps I did. Then came a pretty invasion of\r\nmummers, bearing the gifts of the Club, a fine gold watch and a handsome\r\nbronze lamp. I presented these without much talk, having said my say in\r\nthe verses, to which, by the bye, Colonel H. responded with some comic\r\npersonal couplets, addressed to myself.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the \"jingle.\"\r\n\r\n          Friends! I would not ask to mingle\r\n          This, my very foolish jingle,\r\n  With the tributes more decorous of the feast we hold to-day;\r\n          But the rhymes came, thick and swarming\r\n          Just like bees when honey's forming,\r\n  And I could not find a countersign to order them away.\r\n\r\n          For around this sixteenth lustre\r\n          Of our friend's, such memories cluster\r\n  Of the days that lie behind it, full of glories and regrets,\r\n          Days that brought their toils and troubles,\r\n          Lit by some irradiant bubbles\r\n  Which became prismatic opals in the sun that never sets.\r\n\r\n          Picnics have we held together\r\n          Sailing in the summer weather,\r\n  Sitting low to taste the chowder on the sands of Newport Bay,\r\n          And that wonderful charade, sir,\r\n          You know well, sir, that you made, sir,\r\n  When so many years of earnest did invite an hour of play.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          He shall rank now with the sages\r\n          Who survive in classic pages,\r\n  English, German, French and Latin, Greek, so weary to construe;\r\n          Did he con his Epictetus\r\n          Ere he came to-night to greet us?\r\n  He, _àoristos_ in reverence, among the learned few.\r\n\r\n          He may climb no more the mountain,\r\n          But he still employs the fountain\r\n  Pen from whose incisive point pure Helicon may flow,\r\n          And his \"Yesterdays\" so cheerful\r\n          Charm the world so wild and tearful,\r\n  And the Devil calls for copy, and he never answers \"No.\"\r\n\r\n          Do I speak for everybody,\r\n          When I utter this rhapsòdy,\r\n  To induce our friend to keep his pace in following Life's incline;\r\n          Never slacken, but come on, sir,\r\n          Eighty-four years I have won, sir;\r\n  Still the olive branch shall bless you, still the laurel wreath entwine!\r\n\r\n          So, you scribbling youths and lasses,\r\n          Elders, too, fill high your glasses!\r\n  Let the toast be Wentworth Higginson, of fourscore years possest;\r\n          If the Man was good at twenty,\r\n          He is four times that now, ain't he?\r\n  We declare him four times excellent, and better than his best.\r\n\r\nThe early days of 1904 brought \"a very severe blizzard. Sent tea to the\r\nhackmen on Dartmouth Street corner.\"\r\n\r\nShe never forgot the hackmen in severe weather.\r\n\r\n\"They _must_ have something hot!\" and tea or coffee would be despatched\r\nto the shivering men. They were all her friends; the Journal has many\r\nallusions to \"Mr. Dan\" Herlihy, the owner of the cab stand, her faithful\r\nhelper through many a season.\r\n\r\n\"_January 27, 1904._ I was so anxious to attend to-day's [suffrage]\r\nmeeting, and so afraid of Maud's opposition to my going, that my one\r\nprayer this morning was, 'Help me.' To my utter surprise she did not\r\noppose, but went with me and remained until our part of the hearing was\r\nfinished, when she carried me off. I read my little screed, written\r\nyesterday. When I said, 'Intelligence has no sex, no, gentlemen, nor\r\nfolly either!' laughter resounded, as I meant it should....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 6._ In the evening to hear 'Elijah' finely given. Some of the\r\nmusic brought back to me the desolate scenery of Palestine. It is a very\r\nbeautiful composition.... The alto was frightened at first, coming out\r\nstronger in 'Woe unto them,' and better still in 'Oh, rest in the Lord.'\r\nThe audience seemed to me sleepy and cold. I really led the applause for\r\nthe alto.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 13._... Wrote to John A. Beal, of Beal's Island, offering to\r\nsend instructive literature to that benighted region, where three\r\nmountebanks, pretending to teach religion, robbed the simple people and\r\nexcited them to acts of frenzy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 17._ Mrs. Allen's funeral.... I had a momentary mental vision\r\nof myself in the Valley of the Shadow, with a splendid champion in full\r\narmor walking beside me, a champion sent by God to make the dread\r\npassage easy and safe....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 2...._ Learned the deaths of X. and Abby Morton Diaz. Poor X.,\r\nher conduct made her impossible, but I always thought she would send\r\nflowers to my funeral. Mrs. Diaz is a loss--a high-strung,\r\npublic-spirited woman with an heroic history.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 4._ To the carriage-drivers' ball. They sent a carriage for me\r\nand I took Mary, the maid.... Mr. Dan was waiting outside for me, as was\r\nanother of the committee who troubled me much, pulling and hauling me by\r\none arm, very superfluous. My entrance was greeted with applause, and I\r\nwas led to the high seats, where were two aides of the Governor, Dewey\r\nand White, the latter of whom remembers Governor Andrew. The opening\r\nmarch was very good. I was taken in to supper, as were the two officers\r\njust mentioned. We had a cozy little talk. I came away at about 10.30.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 14._ Mr. Butcher came to breakfast at nine o'clock. He told me\r\nabout the man Toynbee, whom he had known well. He talked also about\r\nGreeks and Hebrews, the animosity of race which kept them apart until\r\nthe flourishing of the Alexandrian school, when the Jews greedily\r\nabsorbed the philosophy of the Greeks.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. S. H. Butcher, the well-known Greek scholar. She enjoyed\r\nhis visit greatly, and they talked \"high and disposedly\" of things\r\nclassical and modern.\r\n\r\n\"_May 28._ My meeting of Women Ministers. They gathered very slowly and\r\nI feared that it would prove a failure, but soon we had a good number.\r\nMary Graves helped me very much.... Afterwards I felt a _malignant_\r\nfatigue and depression, not caring to do anything.\"\r\n\r\nIn June she received the first of her collegiate honors, the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws, conferred by Tufts College. This gratified her deeply,\r\nand she describes the occasion at length, noting that she was \"favored\r\nwith the Tufts yell twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawrence Evans came, and Harry Hall.... I read the part of my speech\r\nabout which I had hesitated, about our trying to put an end to the\r\nTurkish horrors. It was the best of the speech. Seeking divine aid\r\nbefore I made my remarks, I suddenly said to myself, 'Christ, _my\r\nbrother_!' I never _felt_ it before.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 16._ Maud would not allow me to attend Quincy Mansion School\r\nCommencement, to my sincere regret. The fatigue of yesterday was\r\nexcessive, and my dear child knew that another such occasion would be\r\nlikely to make me ill. Charles G. Ames came, from whom I first learned\r\nthe death of Mrs. Cheney's sister, Mary Frank Littlehale; the funeral\r\nset for to-day.... Dear E. D. C. seemed gratified at seeing me and asked\r\nme to say a few words.... She thanked me very earnestly for what I had\r\nsaid, and I at last understood why I had not been allowed to go to\r\nQuincy. It was more important that I should comfort for a moment the\r\nbruised heart of my dear friend than that I should be a guest at the\r\nQuincy Commencement.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 29._ Heard to my sorrow of the death of delightful Sarah Whitman.\r\nWrote a little screed for 'Woman's Journal' which I sent....\"\r\n\r\nIn early July, she went to Concord for a memorial meeting in honor of\r\nNathaniel Hawthorne.\r\n\r\n\"_July 11...._ Alice Blackwell, some days ago, wrote beseeching me to\r\nwrite to President Roosevelt, begging him to do something for the\r\nArmenians. I said to myself, 'No, I won't; I am too tired and have done\r\nenough.' Yesterday's sermon gave me a spur, and this morning I have writ\r\nthe President a long letter, to the effect desired. God grant that it\r\nmay have some result!\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 17._ I despaired of being able to write a poem as requested for\r\nthe Kansas semi-centennial celebration in October, but one line came to\r\nme: 'Sing us a song of the grand old time!' and the rest followed....\"\r\n\r\nThis poem is printed in \"At Sunset.\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 21._ Writ ... to Mrs. Martha J. Hosmer, of Rock Point, Oregon,\r\nwho wrote me a kindly meant letter, exhorting me to 'seek the truth and\r\nlive,' and to write to a Mrs. Helen Wilman, eighty-five years old and\r\nthe possessor of some wonderful knowledge which will help me to renew my\r\nyouth....\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 25._ I could not go to church to-day, fearing to increase my\r\ncold, and not wishing to leave my dear family, so rarely united now.\r\nHave been reading Abbé Loisy's 'Autour d'un petit Livre,' which is an\r\napologetic vindication of his work 'L'Évangile et l'Église,' which has\r\nbeen put upon the Index [Expurgatorius]. I feel sensibly all differences\r\nbetween his apologetic _wobbly_ vindication of the Church of Rome, and\r\nthe sound and firm faith of Thomas Hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 2._ Mr. Fitzhugh Whitehouse, having left here a copy of my\r\n'From Sunset Ridge' for me to furnish with a 'sentiment,' I indited the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n  From Sunset Ridge we view the evening sky,\r\n  Blood red and gold, defeat and victory;\r\n  If in the contest we have failed or won,\r\n  'Twas ours to live, to strive and so pass on.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 5...._ To Peace Congress, where Albert Smiley was presiding. A\r\nwonderful feature came in the person of a Hindu religionist, who came to\r\nplead the cause of the Thibetan Llama. He said that the Thibetans are\r\nnot fighting people: are devoted to religious contemplation, prayer, and\r\nspiritual life. He spoke valorously of the religions in the East as by\r\nfar the most ancient. 'You call us heathen, but we don't call you\r\nheathen'; a good point. He concluded by giving to the assemblage a\r\nbenediction in the fashion of his own religion. It was chanted in a\r\nsweet, slightly musical strain, ending with the repetition of a word\r\nwhich he said meant 'peace.' So much was said about peace that I had to\r\nask leave for a word, and spoke of justice as that without which peace\r\ncannot be had.... I said:--\r\n\r\n'Mr. President and dear friends, assembled in the blessed cause of\r\nPeace, let me remind you that there is one word even more holy than\r\npeace, namely, justice. It is anterior in our intellectual perceptions.\r\nThe impulse which causes men to contend against _in_justice is a divine\r\none, deeply implanted in the human breast. It would be wrong to attempt\r\nto thwart it. I hope that The Hague Tribunal will bear in mind that it\r\nis sacredly pledged to maintain justice. The brightest intellects, the\r\nmost profound study, should be devoted to the promotion of this end.'\r\nThe Greek bishop met me in the ante-room and said, 'We always pray for\r\nyou.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 9._ I have felt more strongly than ever of late that God is\r\nthe only comforter.... These great serious things were always present to\r\nwork for in days in which I exerted myself to amuse others and myself\r\ntoo. It is quite true that I have never given up serious thought and\r\nstudy, but I have not made the serious use of my powers which I ought to\r\nhave made. The Peace Congress has left upon my mind a strong impression\r\nof what the lovers of humanity could accomplish if they were all and\r\nalways in earnest. I seem to hope for a fresh consecration, for\r\nopportunities truly to serve, and for the continuance of that gift of\r\nthe word which is sometimes granted me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 12._ I to attend meeting of Council of Jewish Women; say\r\nsomething regarding education....\r\n\r\n\"I was warmly received and welcomed, and recited my 'Battle Hymn' by\r\nspecial request. This last gave me an unexpected thrill of satisfaction.\r\nThe president said: 'Dear Mrs. Howe, there is nothing in it to wound\r\nus.' I had feared that the last verse might trouble them, but it did\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 19._ Was busy trying to arrange bills and papers so as to go\r\nto Gardiner to-morrow with my Richards son-in-law, when in the late\r\nafternoon Rosalind told me that dear noble Ednah Cheney had died. This\r\ncaused me much distress. My first word was: 'The house of God is closed!\r\nSuch a friend is indeed a sanctuary to which one might retire for refuge\r\nfrom all mean and unworthy things.'\r\n\r\n\"A luminous intellect, unusual powers of judgment and of sympathy as\r\nwell. She has been a tower of strength to me. I sent word by telephone\r\nto Charles G. Ames, begging that _her_ hymn might be sung at church\r\nto-morrow....\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 21._ Dear E. D. C.'s funeral.... I spoke of her faith in\r\nimmortality, which I remember as unwavering. I said: 'No, that lustrous\r\nsoul is not gone down into darkness. It has ascended to a higher light,\r\nto which our best affections and inspirations may aspire.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 25...._ Got out my dearest little Sammy's picture and placed\r\nit on my mantelshelf. [He was a Christmas child.] Maud and I went to the\r\nOratorio, which we enjoyed.... I wondered whether the heavenly ones\r\ncould not enjoy the beautiful music.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 31._ A little festivity.... At supper I was called upon for a\r\ntoast, and after a moment's thought, responded thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"God grant us all to thrive,\r\n  And for a twelvemonth to be alive,\r\n  And every bachelor to wive;\r\n  And many blessings on the head\r\n  Of our dear Presidential Ted.\r\n\r\n\"We saw the year out; a year of grace to me, if ever I had one.\"\r\n\r\nThe new year (1905) found her in full health and activity. On its first\r\nday she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I begin this book by thanking God most deeply that He has permitted me\r\nto see the dawn of this New Year, and by praying that I may not wilfully\r\nwaste one of its precious days. I am now about half through my\r\neighty-sixth year and must feel no surprise if the mandate to remove\r\nshould come suddenly or at any time. But while I live, dear Lord, let me\r\ntruly live in energetic thought and rational action. Bless, I pray Thee,\r\nmy own dear family, my blessed country, Christendom, and all mankind.\r\nThis is my daily prayer and I record it here. Is it amiss that in this\r\nprayer my own people come first? No! for family affection is the\r\nfoundation of all normal human relations. We begin with the Heavenly\r\nFather and open out to the whole human brotherhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 2._ Had an anxious time hunting after my Hawthorne screed to\r\nread this afternoon before the New England Woman's Club. In my\r\nperplexity I said: 'Lord, I do not deserve to have You help me find it';\r\nbut the answer seemed to come thus: 'My help is of grace and not\r\naccording to desert'; and I found it at once where I ought to have\r\nlooked for it at first....\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 20...._ You can't do good with a bad action.\" [Apropos of the\r\nshot fired at the Czar.]\r\n\r\n\"The reason why a little knowledge is dangerous is that your conceit of\r\nit may make you refuse to learn more.\"\r\n\r\nShe was writing a paper on Mrs. Stowe and \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" and\r\nworked hard over it. The pace began to tell.\r\n\r\nShe spoke for the friends of Russian freedom, \"a warm speech, almost\r\nwithout preparation. I knew that I should find my inspiration in the\r\noccasion itself. I had almost a spasm of thankfulness to Almighty God\r\nfor the opportunity to speak for such a cause at such a time.\"\r\n\r\nAt the suffrage hearing soon after, she \"spoke of the force of inertia\r\nas divinely ordained and necessary, but ordained, too, to be overcome by\r\nthe onward impulse which creates worlds, life, and civilization. Said it\r\nwas this inertia which opposed suffrage, the _dread_ of change inherent\r\nin masses, material or moral, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nAmong her winter delights were the \"Longy\" concerts of instrumental\r\nmusic. She writes of one:--\r\n\r\n\"Was carried away by the delight of the music--all wind instruments. A\r\ntrio of Handel for bassoon and two oboes was most solid and\r\nbeautiful.... I could think of nothing but Shakespeare's 'Tempest' and\r\n'Midsummer Night's Dream.' The thought that God had set all human life\r\nand work to music overpowered me, and coming home I had a rhapsody of\r\nthanksgiving for the wonderful gift....\"\r\n\r\nThe next day came an entertainment in aid of Atlanta University and\r\nCalhoun School; she \"enjoyed this exceedingly, especially the plantation\r\nsongs, which are of profoundest pathos, mixed with overpowering humor.\r\nIt was pleasant, too, to see the audience in which descendants of the\r\nold anti-slavery folk formed quite a feature. I had worked hard at the\r\nscreed which was, I think, good. Heard interesting reports of mission\r\nwork in our entire South.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Authors' Club she met Israel Zangwill, who was \"rather\r\nindifferent\" when introduced to her. She thought he probably knew\r\nnothing about her, and adds,--\r\n\r\n\"It is good perhaps to be taken down, now and then.\"\r\n\r\nIn March she attended a hearing in connection with the School Board.\r\n\"The chair most courteously invited me to speak, saying, 'There is here\r\na venerable lady who will hardly be likely to come here again for the\r\npresent discussion, so I shall give her the remaining time.' Whereupon I\r\nleaped into the arena and said my say.\"\r\n\r\nShe had been for some time toiling over a paper on the \"Noble Women of\r\nthe Civil War,\" finding it hard and fatiguing work. On April 5 she\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n\"At 12 M. I had finished my screed on the 'Noble Women of the Civil War'\r\nwhich has been my nightmare ever since March 24, when I began it, almost\r\ndespairing of getting it done.... I have written very carefully and have\r\nhad some things to say which may, I hope, do good. I can now take up\r\nmany small tasks which have had to give way to this one....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 9._ The Greek celebration. The Greek Papa, in full costume,\r\nintoned the Doxology and the assembly all sang solemn anthems. Michael\r\nintroduced me first. My speech was short, but had been carefully\r\nprepared. At the request of the Papa I said at the end: '_Zeto ton\r\nEllenikon ethnos._' My speech and Greek sentence were much applauded. A\r\nyoung Greek lady presented me with a fine bouquet of white carnations\r\nwith blue and white ribbons, the colors of Greece. Sanborn read from\r\ndear Chev's letters of 1825. Michael spoke at great length, with great\r\nvehemence and gesticulation. I understood many words, but could only\r\nguess at the general drift. I imagine that it was very eloquent, as he\r\nwas much applauded.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 30._ Lorin Deland called to talk about the verses which I am to\r\nwrite and read at his theatre. The thought of Cassandra seized me. She,\r\ncoming to the house of the Atridæ, had a vision of its horrors; I,\r\ncoming to this good theatre, have a vision of the good things which have\r\nbeen enjoyed there and which shall still be enjoyed. Wrote down some\r\nfive or six lines, 'lest I forget.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Deland were among her best friends of the second\r\ngeneration. Indeed, there was such a sympathy and comprehension between\r\nher and \"Margaret\" that the latter playfully declared herself a daughter\r\nabandoned in infancy, and was wont to sign herself, \"Your doorstep\r\nBrat\"!\r\n\r\n\"_May 5...._ 'Without religion you will never know the real beauty and\r\nglory of life; you will perceive the discords, but miss the harmony;\r\nwill see the defects, but miss the good in all things.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these years an added burden was laid upon her, in the general and\r\naffectionate desire for her presence on all manner of occasions. The\r\nfiremen must have her at their ball, the Shoe and Leather Trade at their\r\nbanquet, the Paint and Oils Association at their dinner. Their\r\nfestivities would not be complete without her; she loved them, went to\r\ntheir parties, had the right word to say, and came home happy, her arms\r\nfull of flowers.\r\n\r\nIt was all beautiful and heart-warming, but it had to be paid for. May\r\n10 brought the punishment for this season.\r\n\r\n\"Annual Woman Suffrage supper. I was to have spoken at this occasion and\r\nto have recited the poem which I wrote for Castle Square Theatre, but it\r\nwas otherwise ordained. I rose as usual, my head a little misty. A\r\nmighty blow of vertigo seized me.... The elder Wesselhoeft pronounced it\r\na 'brain fag,' not likely to have serious results, but emphatically a\r\n_warning_ not to abuse further my nervous strength. Got up in afternoon\r\nand finished 'Villa Claudia'; was bitterly sad at disappointing the\r\nsuffragists and Deland.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Wesselhoeft was asked on this occasion why, at her age, so severe an\r\nattack as this had not resulted in paralysis. \"Because,\" he replied,\r\n\"she brought to receive it the strength of forty years of age!\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, the next day she felt as if her \"nervous balance was very\r\nwell restored,\" and in a week she was at work again.\r\n\r\n\"_May 18...._ In the evening had word of a Decoration Day poem needed.\r\nAt once tried some lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 19._ Doubted much of my poem, but wrote it, spending most of the\r\nworking hours over it; wrote and rewrote, corrected again and again.\r\nJulia Richards mailed it at about 4 P.M.... Just as I went to bed I\r\nremembered that in the third verse of my poem I had used the words\r\n'tasks' and 'erect' as if they rhymed. This troubled me a good deal. My\r\nprayer was, 'God help the fool.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 20._ My trouble of mind about the deficient verse woke me at 6.30\r\nA.M. I tossed about and wondered how I could lie still until 7.30, my\r\nusual time for rising. The time passed somehow. I could not think of any\r\ncorrection to make in my verse. Hoped that I should find that I had not\r\nwritten it as I feared. When I came to look at it, there it was.\r\nInstantly a line with a proper rhyme presented itself to my mind. To add\r\nto my trouble I had lost the address to which I had sent the poem. My\r\ngranddaughter, Julia Richards, undertook to interview the Syndicate by\r\nlong-distance telephone, and, failing this, to telegraph the new line\r\nfor me. So I left all in her hands. When I returned, she met me with a\r\nsmile and said, 'It is all right, Grandmother.' She had gone out, found\r\na New York directory, guessed at the Syndicate, got the correspondent,\r\nand put her in possession of the new line. I was greatly relieved. I\r\nhave been living lately with work running after me all the time. Must\r\nnow have a breathing spell. Have still my 'Simplicity' screed to\r\ncomplete.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Authors' Club celebrated her eighty-sixth birthday by a charming\r\nfestival, modelled on the Welsh Eistedfodd, \"at which every bard of that\r\nnation brought four lines of verse--a sort of four-leaved clover--to his\r\nchief.\"[146] Sixty quatrains made what she calls \"an astonishing\r\ntestimonial of regard.\" Colonel Higginson, who presided most charmingly,\r\nread many of these tributes aloud, and the Birthday Queen responded in a\r\nrhyme scribbled hastily the day before. Here are a few of the tributes,\r\ntogether with her \"reply\":--\r\n\r\nEISTEDFODD\r\n\r\n  Each bard of Wales, who roams the kingdom o'er\r\n  Each year salutes his chief with stanzas four;\r\n  Behold us here, each bearing verse in hand\r\n  To greet the four-leaved clover of our band.\r\n\r\n                                     THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON.\r\n\r\n  [146] T.

I slept rather late, yesterday\r\nhaving been eminently a 'boot-and-saddle' day.... The Greeks, mostly\r\nworking-people, sent me a superb leash of roses with a satin ribbon\r\nbearing a Greek inscription. My visitors were numerous, many of them the\r\nbest friends that time has left me. T. W. H. was very dear. My dear ones\r\nof the household bestirred themselves to send flowers, according to my\r\nwishes, to the Children's Hospital and to Charles Street Jail.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 28._... A great box of my birthday flowers ornamented the pulpit\r\nof the church. They were to be distributed afterwards to the\r\nSunday-School children, some to the Primary Teachers' Association; a\r\nbunch of lilies of the valley to Reverend Hayward's funeral to-morrow. I\r\nsuddenly bethought me of Padre Roberto, and with dear Laura's help sent\r\nhim a box of flowers for his afternoon service, with a few lines of\r\nexplanation, to which I added the motto: '_Unus deus, una fides, unum\r\nbaptisma._' This filled full the cup of my satisfaction regarding the\r\ndisposal of the flowers. They seemed to me such sacred gifts that I\r\ncould not bear merely to enjoy them and see them fade. Now they will not\r\nfade for me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many \"screeds\" written this season was one on \"The Value of\r\nSimplicity,\" which gave her much trouble. She takes it to pieces and\r\nrewrites it, and afterwards is \"much depressed; no color in anything.\"\r\nFrom Gardiner she \"writes to Sanborn\" for the Horatian lines she wishes\r\nto quote. (\"Whenever,\" she said once to Colonel Higginson, \"I want to\r\nfind out about anything difficult, I always write to Sanborn!\" \"Of\r\ncourse!\" replied Higginson. \"We all do!\" At this writing the same course\r\nis pursued, there is reason to believe, by many persons in many\r\ncountries.)\r\n\r\nIt is remembered that in these days when she was leaving Gardiner at the\r\nlast moment she handed Laura a note. It read, \"Be sure to rub the knee\r\nthoroughly night and morning!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" she was asked, \"did I not have this a week ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate to be rubbed!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"_July 1.

Feared that I might be visited\r\nby 'senile melancholia' against which I shall pray with all my might....\r\nBegan Plato's 'Laws.'\"\r\n\r\nPlato seems to have acted as a tonic, for on the same day she writes to\r\nher daughter-in-law, expressing her joy in \"Harry's\" latest honor, the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Laws conferred by Harvard College:--\r\n\r\n                     _To Mrs. Henry Marion Howe_\r\n\r\n                                         OAK GLEN, July 2, 1905.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your good letter, giving me such a gratifying\r\naccount of the doings at Harvard on Commencement Day. I feel quite moved\r\nat the thought of my dear son's receiving this well-merited honor from\r\nhis _alma mater_. It shows, among other things, how amply he has\r\nretrieved his days of boyish mischief. This is just what his dear father\r\ndid. I think you must both have had a delightful time. How did our H. M.\r\nH. look sitting up in such grave company? I hope he has not lost his old\r\ntwinkle. I am very proud and glad....\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was indeed proud of all her son's honors; of any success of child or\r\ngrandchild; yet she would pretend to furious jealousy. \"I see your book\r\nis praised, Sir!\" (or, \"Madam!\") \"It probably does not deserve it. H'm!\r\nnobody praises _my_ books!\" etc., etc. And all the time her face so\r\nshining with pleasure and tenderness under the sternly bended brows that\r\nthe happy child needed no other praise from any one.\r\n\r\n\"_July 23_.... I feel to-day the isolation consequent upon my long\r\nsurvival of the threescore and ten apportioned as the term of human\r\nlife. Brothers and sisters, friends and fellow-workers, many are now in\r\nthe silent land. I am praying for some good work, paying work, so that I\r\nmay efficiently help relatives who need help, and good causes whose\r\ndemand for aid is constant....\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 24_. To-day Harry and Alice Hall have left me with their two dear\r\nchildren. I have had much delight with baby Frances, four months old....\r\nI pray that I may be able to help these children. I looked forward to\r\ntheir visit as a kindness to them and their parents, but it has been a\r\ngreat kindness to me....\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 5_. Some bright moments to-day. At my prayer a thought of\r\nthe divine hand reaching down over the abyss of evil to rescue\r\ndespairing souls!...\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 19_. Dear Flossy and Harry left. I shall miss them\r\ndreadfully. She has taken care of me these many weeks and has been most\r\ncompanionable and affectionate. My dear boy was as ever very sweet and\r\nkind....\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 22_. Have puzzled much about my promised screed for the\r\n'Cosmopolitan' on 'What would be the Best Gift to the People of the\r\nCountry?' As I got out of bed it suddenly occurred to me as 'the glory\r\nof having promoted recognition of human brotherhood.' This must include\r\n'Justice to Women.' I meant to tackle the theme at once, but after\r\nbreakfast a poem came to me in the almost vulgar question, 'Does your\r\nMother know you're out?' I had to write this, also a verse or two in\r\ncommemoration of Frederic L. Knowles, a member of our Authors' Club, who\r\nhas just passed away.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 25_.... I must have got badly chilled this morning, for my\r\nright hand almost refuses to guide the pen. I tried several times to\r\nbegin a short note to David Hall, but could not make distinct letters.\r\nThen I forced myself to pen some rough draft and now the pen goes\r\nbetter, but not yet quite right. I had the same experience last winter\r\nonce. I suppose that I have overtired my brain; it is a warning....\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 5_.... I had a moment of visioning, in which I seemed to see\r\nChrist on the cross refusing to drink the vinegar and gall, and myself\r\nto reach up a golden cup containing 'the love pledge of humanity.'\r\nComing home I scrawled the verses before lying down to rest.\"[147]\r\n\r\n  [147] These verses are printed in At Sunset, under the title of\r\n  \"Humanity,\" and at the head of chapter XI of this volume.\r\n\r\n\"_October 9_. After a week of painful anxiety I learn to-day that my\r\nscreed for the 'Cosmopolitan' is accepted. I felt so persuaded to the\r\ncontrary that I delayed to open the envelope until I had read all my\r\nother letters....\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 25_. Meeting of Boston Authors' Club.... Worked all the\r\nmorning at sorting my letters and papers.... Laura, Maud, and I drove\r\nout to Cambridge. I had worked hard all the morning, but had managed to\r\nput together a scrap of rhyme in welcome of Mark Twain. A candle was lit\r\nfor me to read by, and afterwards M. T. jumped upon a chair and made\r\nfun, some good, some middling, for some three quarters of an hour. The\r\neffect of my one candle lighting up his curly hair was good and my rhyme\r\nwas well received.\r\n\r\n  \"_Mark_ the gracious, welcome guest,\r\n  Master of heroic jest;\r\n  He who cheers man's dull abodes\r\n  With the laughter of the gods;\r\n  To the joyless ones of earth\r\n  Sounds the reveille of mirth.\r\n\r\n  \"Well we meet, to part with pain,\r\n  But ne'er shall _he_ and _we_ be Twain.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 5. Gardiner, Maine._ On coming to breakfast found a note from\r\ndearest Maud, saying that she would sail this day for Spain. Was much\r\novercome by this intelligence, yet felt that it was on the whole best.\r\nThe day passed rather heavily, the relish seemed gone from everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 6. Boston_.... Reaching home I lay down to rest, but the\r\nfeeling of Maud's departure so overpowered me that I got up and went\r\nabout, crying out: 'I can't stand it!' I soon quieted down, being\r\ncomforted by my dear Laura, Julia, and Betty, but could not sleep until\r\nbedtime, when I slept soundly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\"THE SUNDOWN SPLENDID AND SERENE\"\r\n\r\n1906-1907; _aet._ 87-88\r\n\r\nHYMN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERALS\r\n\r\n_Held in Boston, 1907_\r\n\r\n  Hail!

I was in some rural region\r\nalone; the clear blue sky was over my head. I looked up and said, 'I am\r\nfed from God's table. I am sheltered under His roof.' While I still felt\r\nthis joy, a lone man, passing by, broke into a complaint on the hardness\r\nof things. I wanted in my dream to call him back, but he passed too\r\nrapidly. I still see in my 'mind's eye' that blue sky and the lone man\r\npassing by, I still recall the thrill of that meditation, literally in\r\nDreamland, as I was quite asleep when it visited me....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great event of this winter was a trip to Baltimore for a Woman\r\nSuffrage Convention.\r\n\r\n\"_February 4._ I had not been able to think of anything to say in\r\nBaltimore, but this morning it seemed to come to me. I have just written\r\nout my screed, ... taking a point of view which I do not think I have\r\npresented before, viz.: that inferior education and restricted activity\r\nmade women the inferiors of men, as naturally as training, education,\r\nand free agency make civilized men the superior of the savage. I think\r\nthat the dear Lord gave me this screed, which is short and simple\r\nenough, but, I think, convincing....\"\r\n\r\nThis Convention came near being her last. Tonsillitis was epidemic in\r\nthe city; the halls were draughty; at one meeting a woman with a severe\r\ncold, a stranger, kissed her effusively. She took the infection, was\r\nprostrated for some days, and made the return journey while still too\r\nweak to travel. Florence, who was with her, protested in vain. \"I would\r\ngo,\" she said, \"_if the hearse was at the door!_\" A serious illness\r\nfollowed on her return. A month and more passed before she began to\r\nregain strength and spirits.[148]\r\n\r\n  [148] It may be noted that this epidemic of tonsillitis was actually\r\n  fatal to Miss Susan B. Anthony, who never recovered from the illness\r\n  contracted in Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\"_March 31._ Had a happy lighting up when I lay down for afternoon rest.\r\nFelt the immensity of God's goodness and took heart for the future.\"\r\n\r\nIn April she records \"a delightful visit from Robert Collyer,\r\naccompanied by Annie Fields. I asked him: 'Robert, what is religion?' He\r\nreplied, 'To love God with all one's heart, Christ helping us.' He began\r\nhis prayer last Sunday thus: 'Our Father who art in heaven, on earth,\r\nand in hell!'\"\r\n\r\nOn April 13, she was \"out for the first time since February 14, when I\r\nreturned sick from Baltimore....\"\r\n\r\nAnother week and she was at her church, for the first time since January\r\n18.\r\n\r\nIt had been a long and weary time, yet one remembers not so much the\r\nsuffering and confinement as the gayety of it. There was a sigh for the\r\nJournal, but for the family, and the faithful nurse,--\r\n\r\n  \"Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles,\r\n  Nods and becks, and wreathéd smiles.\"\r\n\r\nThis nurse was known to others as Lucy Voshell, but her patient promptly\r\nnamed her \"Wollapuk.\" She was as merry as she was skillful, and the two\r\nmade much fun together. Even when the patient could not speak, she could\r\ntwinkle. As strength gradually returned, the ministrations of Wollapuk\r\nbecame positively scenes of revelry; and the anxious guardian below,\r\nwarding off would-be interviewers or suppliants, might be embarrassed to\r\nhear peals of laughter ringing down the stair.\r\n\r\nEarly in May she has \"young J. W. Hurlburt to dine; a pleasant young\r\nplaywright, grandson to General Hurlburt of the Civil War....\"\r\n\r\n\"I had lent my play of 'Hippolytus' to young Hurlburt to read. He\r\nbrought it back yesterday with so much praise of parts of it as to\r\nrevive the pang which I felt when, Charlotte Cushman and Edwin Booth\r\nhaving promised to fill the principal parts, the manager's wife suddenly\r\nrefused to fill her part, and the whole fell through. This with much\r\nother of my best literary work has remained a dead letter on my own\r\nshelves. I am glad as well as sad to feel that it deserved better\r\ntreatment.\"\r\n\r\nShe had a wheel-chair, and on pleasant days it was her delight to be\r\nwheeled through the Public Garden, now in full May beauty, to see the\r\nflowers and the children. She was able to attend several meetings, and\r\nto write several papers.\r\n\r\n\"_May 18._ Have read part of the recital of Anna Ticknor's achievement\r\nin her society to encourage studies at home. Her work is really heroic.\r\nI wish that I had better understood it. Still I did admire it a great\r\ndeal, but had little idea of the great benevolence and sympathy\r\ndeveloped in her work, which was a godsend to thousands of women.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 26._ My dear son arrived in the evening to celebrate my birthday.\r\nHe seems well and happy. I was thankful to see him. Flowers kept\r\narriving all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 27._ Attended church and carried some of my birthday flowers for\r\nthe pulpit.... In the afternoon a beautiful reception which the rain\r\nkept from being the over-crowd which I had rather feared. Colonel\r\nHigginson came and gave me some lovely verses written for the occasion.\r\nWilliam R. Thayer did likewise. Arthur Upson had already sent me some. I\r\nenjoyed it all very much; dined downstairs with my dear family, who\r\ndrank my health standing. H. M. H., being called upon for a word, said,\r\n'The dear old girl!' and could not have said better. I thanked and\r\nblessed them all. We passed the evening together. The Greeks of Boston\r\nsent splendid red roses and ribbons with motto. The Italians sent\r\nflowers.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this she wrote an essay on \"How to Keep Young,\" in which she\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"Try to keep in touch with the best spirits of your time, with those who\r\nare raising instead of lowering the tone of the atmosphere in which they\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n\"Avoid the companionship of those who deride sacred things and are\r\ninclined to ignore the limits of refinement and good taste.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that ignoble amusements react upon character.\r\n\r\n\"Never forget that we grow like to that we contemplate.\r\n\r\n\"Keep it always in mind that it must be through our own efforts that our\r\nprogress through life shall bring with it the fulfilment of the best\r\npromise of our youth.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_July 2.

God\r\nrest his soul!\r\n\r\n\"I pray that my great pain at the death of my son-in-law may inspire me\r\nto help the blind as I never have helped them!\"\r\n\r\n\"My strength has failed so much of late that my strong love of life\r\nbegins to waver. I should be glad to live to print some of my studies in\r\nPhilosophy, and to have some of my musical compositions taken down by\r\ndictation.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 31...._ The last day of a summer which brought a serious grief\r\nin the death of Michael Anagnos, who, ever since my visit to Greece in\r\n1867, has been an important factor in my life. I am much troubled in the\r\neffort to compose a poem to be read at the memorial services to be held\r\nfor him in late October....\"\r\n\r\nA photograph taken at this time shows her sitting in her hooded chair on\r\nthe piazza, her Greek books and her canary beside her, a serene and\r\nlovely picture. It was so she used to sit every morning. First she read\r\nher Testament, and a prayer of James Martineau, or some other good\r\nsaint; this she called \"taking the altitude\"; then she turned to her\r\nÆschylus or Aristotle.\r\n\r\nBefore thus settling down, there would be a walk on the piazza, or along\r\nthe highway. Sheltered by a broad hat, the friend of many years, wrapped\r\nin the \"passionate pilgrim,\" as she named a certain ancient purple\r\ncloak, leaning on her ebony stick--who that passed that way has not seen\r\nher? Bits of her talk, as we strolled together, come back to us; as when\r\nthe clouds parted suddenly at the close of a gray day, then shutting in\r\nagain. \"Oh!\" she cried, \"it is like being engaged to the man you love,\r\nfor five minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 16...._ I had had much hesitation about undertaking to\r\nspeak at Shiloh Baptist Church [colored] this afternoon; but it came to\r\nme as something which I ought to do, and so I gave the promise, and,\r\nwith some studying, wrote the sermon. The result fully justified the\r\neffort. I spoke to a large and very attentive congregation, in which a\r\nnumber of white outsiders were mingled in with the people of the\r\nchurch.... Mrs. Jeter sang my 'Battle Hymn,' the congregation joining in\r\nthe 'Glory Hallelujah.' I then read my screed, which was heard with\r\nprofound attention, one and another crying out at intervals, 'Amen!' and\r\n'Glory be to God!'... I was very thankful for the good issue of what had\r\nseemed an almost wild undertaking at eighty-seven years of age.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 23._ Have prayed and worked over the poem for Michael's\r\nmemorial services--think that I have made it as good as I can, but not\r\ngood enough. Alas! I am too old.\"\r\n\r\nShe went up to Boston for this meeting in Tremont Temple, which was a\r\nmost impressive one, Greeks and Americans uniting to do honor to a good\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"_October 24...._ I read my verse, my voice serving me very well. Bishop\r\nLawrence helped me both to rise and to return to my seat. He made a most\r\ntouching allusion to my dearest dear Julia's devotion to the blind, and\r\nsaid where a man was engaged in a noble work there usually rose up a\r\nnoble woman to help him.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 26._ Had a sudden blessed thought this morning, viz.: that the\r\n'Tabernacle eternal in the heavens' is the eternity of truth and right.\r\nI naturally desire life after death, but if it is not granted me, I\r\nhave yet a part in the eternal glory of this tabernacle.\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 29._ Dear H. M. H. left us this morning, after a short but\r\nvery pleasant visit. He brought here his decorations of his Russian\r\norder to show us; they are quite splendid. He is the same dear old\r\nsimple music- and mischief-loving fellow, very sensitive for others,\r\nvery modest for himself, and very dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 7...._ Prayed _hard_ this morning that my strength fail not.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this summer, an electric elevator had been put into the Boston\r\nhouse, and life was made much easier for her. From this time we became\r\nfamiliar with the vision of her that still abides, flitting up or down\r\nin her gilded car. Watching her ascent, clad in white, a smile on her\r\nlips, her hand waving farewell, one could only think of \"The chariot of\r\nIsrael and the horsemen thereof.\"\r\n\r\nAnother good gift was a Victor machine. When the after-dinner reading\r\nwas over, she would say, \"Now bring my opera-box!\"\r\n\r\nThe white armchair was wheeled into the passage between the two parlors.\r\nHere she sat in state, while the great singers poured out their\r\ntreasures before her, while violinist and pianist gave her their best.\r\nShe listened with keen and critical enjoyment, recalling how Malibran\r\ngave this note, how Grisi and Mario sang that duet. Then she would go to\r\nthe piano and play from memory airs from \"Tancredi,\" \"Il Pirata,\"\r\n\"Richard Coeur de Lion,\" and other operas known to us only through\r\nher. Or she would--always without notes--play the \"Barber of Seville\"\r\nalmost from beginning to end, with fingers still deft and nimble.\r\n\r\nShe loved the older operas best. After an air from \"Don Giovanni,\" she\r\nwould say, \"Mozart must be in heaven: they could never get on without\r\nhim!\" She thought Handel's \"Messiah\" the most divine point reached by\r\nearthly music. Beethoven awed and swayed her deeply, and she often\r\nquoted his utterance while composing, \"_Ich trat in der Nähe Gottes!_\"\r\nShe thrilled with tender pleasure over Verdi's \"_Non ti scordar_,\" or\r\n\"_Ai nostri monti_,\" and over \"Martha.\" She enjoyed Chopin \"almost too\r\nmuch.\" \"He is exquisite,\" she would say, \"but somehow--rotten!\"\r\n\r\nAmong the pleasures of this winter was a visit to New York. She writes\r\nafter it:--\r\n\r\n\"My last day in my dear son's house. He and Fannie have been devotedly\r\nkind to me. They made me occupy their room, much to my bodily comfort,\r\nbut to the great disquiet of my mind, as I hated much to inconvenience\r\nthem. My son has now a very eminent position.... God bless the house and\r\nall in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 17._ The Old South Chapter of D.A.R.'s met in the real Old\r\nSouth Church; there was much good speaking. I recited my 'Battle Hymn'\r\nand boasted my descent from General Marion, the Swamp Fox, saying also,\r\n'When, eluding the vigilance of children and grandchildren, I come to\r\nsuch a meeting as this, without a previous promise not to open my lips,\r\nI think that I show some of the dexterity of my illustrious relative.' I\r\nalso had to spring up and tell them that my grandmother, niece to\r\nGeneral Marion, gave her flannel petticoat to make cartridges for the\r\nsoldiers of the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe path of the guardian (or jailer, as she sometimes put it) was not\r\nalways plain. The wayfaring woman might easily err therein.\r\n\r\nAfter some severe fatigue, convention or banquet, she might say, \"This\r\nis the last time. Never let me do this again!\"\r\n\r\nThereupon a promise would be exacted and made. The fatigue would pass\r\nand be forgotten, and the next occasion be joyously prepared for.\r\n\r\n\"You told me not to let you go!\" the poor jailer would say.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't mean it!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you promised!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was two weeks ago. Two weeks is a long time for me to keep a\r\npromise!\"\r\n\r\nIf the jailer still persisted, she played her last card and took the\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\n\"I can't talk about it. You tire my head!\"\r\n\r\nNow and then Greek met Greek. One snowy afternoon she encountered the\r\nresident granddaughter, cloaked and hooded, preparing to brave the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\"Dear child,\" said the grandmother, \"I do not often use authority with\r\nyou young people, but this time I must. I cannot allow you to go out in\r\nthis blizzard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest grandmother,\" replied the maiden, \"_where are you going\r\nyourself_?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. The two generations dissolved in laughter, and\r\nstarted out together.\r\n\r\nShe bids farewell to 1906 as \"dear Year that hast brought me so many\r\ncomforts and pleasures!\" and thus hails the New Year:--\r\n\r\n\"I earnestly pray for God's blessing on this year!... I might possibly\r\nlike one more European journey to see the Gallery at Madrid, and the\r\nchâteaux of Touraine, but I do not ask it, as I may have more important\r\noccupation for my time and money.... _Du reste_, the dear Father has\r\ndone so much better for me, in many ways, than I have ingenuity to wish,\r\nthat I can only say, 'Thy will be done, only desert me not.'\"\r\n\r\nShe determines \"at last to be more prompt in response to letters and\r\nbills. I am now apt to lose sight of them, to my great inconvenience and\r\nthat of other people.\"\r\n\r\nIt was pain to her to destroy even a scrap of paper that bore writing:\r\nthe drifts of notes and letters grew higher and higher among the piles\r\nof books, new and old. The books were not all her own choice. Many a\r\nfirstling of verse found its way to her, inscribed with reverent or\r\nloving words by the author. Would Mrs. Howe send a few lines of\r\nappreciation or criticism? She would; mostly she did. She wrote in the\r\nautograph albums, and on the pieces of silk and cotton for \"autograph\r\nquilts\": she signed the photographs: she tried to do everything they\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"_January 11._ Having hammered at some verses for General Lee, when I\r\nlay down to rest a perfect flood of rhymes seized me. Nonsense verses\r\nfor to-morrow's festival; there seemed to be no end to them. I scrawled\r\nsome of them down as it was late and dark. Sanborn to dine--unexpected,\r\nbut always welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 12._ Copied and completed my lines for the evening. Found a\r\nlarge assemblage of members and invited guests [of the Authors' Club]; a\r\ndais and chair prepared for me, Colonel Higginson standing on my right.\r\nMany presentations--Gilder and Clyde Fitch, Owen Wister, Norman Hapgood.\r\nAldrich [T. B.] took me in to dinner and sat on my right, Hon. John D.\r\nLong on my left; next beyond A. sat Homans Womans.[149] I despaired of\r\nmaking my jingle tell in so large and unfamiliar a company. At last I\r\ntook courage and read it, bad as I thought it. To my surprise, it told,\r\nand created the merriment which had been my object so far as I had any.\r\nMy 'Battle Hymn' was sung finely by a male quartette. Colonel Higginson\r\nand I were praised almost out of our senses. A calendar, got up with\r\nmuch labor, was presented to each of us.\"\r\n\r\n  [149] Mrs. Charles Homans.\r\n\r\n\"_January 13._ To church, to take down my vanity after last evening's\r\nlaudations....\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 15._ Made a final copy of my lines on Robert E. Lee,--read\r\nthem to Rosalind--the last line drew a tear from each of us, so I\r\nconcluded that it would do and sent it.\r\n\r\n\"To Tuesday Club, where the effort which I made to hear speakers tired\r\nmy head badly. Themes: 'Whether and how to teach Ethics in Public\r\nSchools'; also, 'The English Education Bill.' Socrates having been\r\nmentioned as an exemplar, I suddenly cried out that I thought he did\r\nwrong to stay and suffer by unjust laws and popular superstition. A\r\nfirst-class American would have got away and would have fought those\r\npeople to the bitter death. This fiery little episode provoked laughter,\r\nand several privately told me they were glad of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 25...._ Read Colonel Higginson's account of me in the\r\n'Outlook.' Wrote him a note of thanks, saying that he has written\r\nbeautifully, with much tact and kindness. It remains true that he has\r\nnot much acquaintance with the serious side of my life and character, my\r\nstudies of philosophy, etc. He has described what he has seen of me and\r\nhas certainly done it with skill and with a most kind intention.\"\r\n\r\nShe said of the Colonel's paper, \"He does not realize that my _life_ has\r\nbeen here, the four walls of my room.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 5...._ Began a sermon on the text, 'I saw Satan like\r\nlightning fall from heaven.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 6._ Wrote a good bit on the sermon begun yesterday--the theme\r\nattracts me much. If I give it, I will have Whittier's hymn sung: 'Oh!\r\nsometimes gleams upon our sight--'\r\n\r\n\"Wrote to thank Higginson for sending me word that I am the first woman\r\nmember of the society of American Authors....\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 14._ Luncheon at 3 Joy Street.... My seat was between T. W.\r\nH. and President Eliot, with whom I had not spoken in many years. He\r\nspoke to me at once and we shook hands and conversed very cordially. I\r\nhad known his father quite well--a lover of music, who had much to do\r\nwith the early productions of Beethoven's Symphonies in Boston,\r\ncollecting money in aid of the undertaking. President Eliot made a good\r\nspeech for Berea; others followed.... When my name was called, I had\r\nalready a good thought to express.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 18._ To N.E.W.C., where Colonel Higginson and I spoke of\r\nLongfellow; I from long and intimate acquaintance, he from a literary\r\npoint of view. He said, I thought rightly, that we are too near him to\r\nbe able to judge his merits as a poet; time must test them.\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 27...._ In evening went with the Jewett sisters to the\r\ncelebration of Longfellow's Centennial. I had copied my verses written\r\nfor the first Authors' Reading _in re_ Longfellow, rather hoping that I\r\nmight be invited to read them. This did not happen. I had had no reason\r\nto suppose that it would, not having been thereunto invited. Had a seat\r\non the platform among the poet's friends, myself one of the oldest of\r\nthem. It seemed as if I could hardly hold my tongue, which, however, I\r\ndid. I remembered that God has given me many opportunities of speaking\r\nmy thoughts. If He withheld this one I am bound to suppose it was for\r\nthe best. I sat on the platform, where Sarah Jewett and I were the only\r\nwomen in the charmed circle.\r\n\r\n\"Item. The audience rose and greeted me as I ascended to the platform at\r\nSanders Theatre.\"\r\n\r\nShe could not bear to be \"left out\"; indeed, she rarely was. In this one\r\nrespect she was, perhaps, the \"spoiled child\" that she sometimes called\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nMarch brought a new pleasure, in seeing and meeting Novelli, the great\r\nItalian actor.\r\n\r\n\"_March 14._ The banquet of the Circolo at Lombardy Inn.... My seat was\r\nat the head of the table with Novelli on my right and Tosti, the consul,\r\non my left. Had some pleasant talk with each. Then I had a good\r\ninspiration for part of my speech, in which I mentioned the egg used by\r\nColumbus, and made to stand, to show that things held to be impossible\r\noften proved possible. I said that out of this egg 'was hatched the\r\nAmerican Eagle.' Madame Novelli shed tears at this, and Novelli kissed\r\nmy hand. The Italian servants listened eagerly to all the speaking, and\r\nparticipated in the applause. President Geddes, Secretary Jocelyn, and\r\nothers spoke well and rather briefly. Dear Padre Roberto was really\r\neloquent.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 16...._ In the evening to see Novelli in 'Morte Civile'; his\r\npersonation wonderfully fine, surpassing even Salvini in the part....\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 17...._ Went to South Boston to say a word at the presentation\r\nof dear Michael's portrait to the Perkins Institution by the Howe\r\nMemorial Club.... Also had a wonderful fit of verse--wrote two sonnets\r\nto Dante and a versification of my conceit about the hatching of the\r\nAmerican Eagle from the egg of Columbus.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 23._ A 'boot-and-saddle' day.... I found that my Authors' Club\r\nwill meet to-day in Cambridge. Higginson telephoned, asking me to speak\r\nof Aldrich; I asked permission to leave the College Club after the\r\nspeaking. Ordered a carriage at 4.30, sprang into it, and reached the\r\nAuthors' meeting in good time to say something about Aldrich.... Found a\r\nman who has studied the Berber races in Africa. Had a good talk with\r\nhim. Came home dreadfully tired. To bed by 9.30. At the College Club I\r\nsaid that to give women the vote in this State would not double the\r\nilliterate vote--proposed a census of comparative illiteracy of the\r\nsexes in Massachusetts at least.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had long besought her to have her musical compositions written down,\r\nand now this was done in part. Once or twice a week Mr. John M. Loud\r\ncame to the house and took down her melodies, she singing and playing\r\nthem to him. She always enjoyed the hour with the young composer. A\r\nnumber of the melodies thus preserved were published in a \"Song Album\"\r\nby G. Schirmer some months later.\r\n\r\n\"_April 8._ Great trouble of mind about attending the Peace Convention\r\nin New York, which I have promised to do. Laura dead against it,\r\nreinforced by Wesselhoeft, Sr., who pronounces it dangerous for me. I at\r\nlast wrote to ask my dear minister about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 9...._ A violent snowstorm keeps me at home. Minister and wife\r\nwrite, 'Don't go to Peace Convention.' I asked God in my prayer this\r\nmorning to make going possible or impossible for me. I took C. G. A.'s\r\nletter as making it impossible, as I had decided to abide by his\r\ndecision. Wrote a letter of explanation to Anna Garlin Spencer. I am\r\nmuch disappointed, but it is a relief not to cause Laura such painful\r\nanxiety as she would have felt if I had decided to go. She wept with\r\njoy when I gave it up. We had a very pleasant dinner party for the\r\nBarrett Wendells with their friends, Professor Ames, of Berkeley\r\nUniversity, California, 'Waddy' Longfellow, Charles Gibson, Laura,\r\nBetty, and I.\"\r\n\r\nShe sent a letter to the Convention, which was read by Florence. In\r\nthis, after recalling her Peace Crusade of 1872, she said:--\r\n\r\n\"Here and there, a sisterly voice responded to my appeal, but the\r\ngreater number said: 'We have neither time nor money that we can call\r\nour own. We cannot travel, we cannot meet together.' And so my intended\r\nPeace Congress of Women melted away like a dream, and my final meeting,\r\nheld in the world's great metropolis, did not promise to lead to any\r\nimportant result.\r\n\r\n\"What has made the difference between that time and this? New things, so\r\nfar as women are concerned, viz.: the higher education conceded to them,\r\nand the discipline of associated action, with which later years have\r\nmade them familiar. Who shall say how great an element of progress has\r\nexisted in this last clause? Who shall say what fretting of personal\r\nambition has become merged in the higher ideal of service to the State\r\nand to the world? The noble army of women which I saw as a dream, and to\r\nwhich I made my appeal, has now come into being. On the wide field where\r\nthe world's great citizens band together to uphold the highest interests\r\nof society, women of the same type employ their gifts and graces to the\r\nsame end. Oh, happy change! Oh, glorious metamorphosis! In less than\r\nhalf a century the conscience of mankind has made its greatest stride\r\ntoward the control of human affairs. The women's colleges and the\r\nwomen's clubs have had everything to do with the great advance which we\r\nsee in the moral efficiency of our sex. These two agencies have been\r\nderided and decried, but they have done their work.\r\n\r\n\"If a word of elderly counsel may become me at this moment, let me say\r\nto the women here assembled: Do not let us go back from what we have\r\ngained. Let us, on the contrary, press ever forward in the light of the\r\nnew knowledge, of the new experience. If we have rocked the cradle, if\r\nwe have soothed the slumbers of mankind, let us be on hand at their\r\ngreat awakening to make steadfast the peace of the world!\"\r\n\r\nShe was glad afterward that she had not gone; but a significant\r\ncorollary to the matter appears on April 25:--\r\n\r\n\"Providence--a pleasant trip, made possible by dear Laura's departure.\"\r\n\r\n(That is, \"dear Laura\" knew nothing about it till afterward. How often\r\nwe recalled the old Quaker's saying to her, \"It was borne in upon me at\r\nan early period that if I told no one what I intended to do, I should be\r\nenabled to do it!\")\r\n\r\nIn the last week of April (\"dear Laura\" being still absent) she spoke\r\nfour times in public, on four successive days. These addresses were at\r\nthe Kindergarten for the Blind (\"I missed the snap which Michael's\r\npresence was wont to give; I spoke praise of him to the children, as one\r\nto be held in dear remembrance; to the visitors, as having left the\r\npublic a sacred legacy in these schools, which he created with so much\r\nlabor\"), at Faneuil Hall, a meeting about Old Home Week, at the West\r\nNewton High School, and at Providence. On the fifth day she was at the\r\nWintergreen Club, answering the question, \"What is the Greatest Evil of\r\nthe Present Day?\"--\"False estimates of values, vehement striving for\r\nwhat hinders rather than helps our spiritual development.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this bout she was glad to rest a day or two, but in another week\r\nwas ready for the Woman Suffrage Festival. \"I to open it, evening,\r\nFaneuil Hall. A day of rushing. Lady Mary and Professor Gilbert Murray\r\nto breakfast 9 A.M., which I much enjoyed. Then my little music man, who\r\ntook three tunes; then a snatch at preparation for the evening's\r\nexercises. Jack and Elizabeth Chapman in the afternoon. At 4.45 got a\r\nlittle rest and sleep. At 5.40 drove to Faneuil Hall, which I found not\r\nso full as sometimes. Thought miserably of my speech. Light to read it\r\nvery dim. I called to order, introduced Mr. White and the ladies'\r\nquartette, then read my poor little scribble.... I was thankful to get\r\nthrough my part, and my speech in print wasn't bad at all.\"\r\n\r\nIn May she preached at the Church of the Disciples.\r\n\r\n\"A culmination of anxiety for this day, desired and yet dreaded. My head\r\ngrowled a little at waking, but not badly. My voice seemed all right,\r\nbut how about the matter of my sermon? Was it all worth while, and on\r\nWhitsunday too? I wore my white cashmere dress. Laura went with me to\r\nchurch. C. G. A. was there. As he led me to the pulpit, the\r\ncongregation rose. The service was very congenial and calming to my\r\nanxiety. I read the sermon quite audibly from beginning to end. It was\r\nlistened to with profound attention, if I may say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 20...._ Marion Crawford arrived soon after three for a little\r\nvisit. He looks greatly improved in health since I last saw him. He must\r\nhave passed through some crisis and come out conqueror. He has all his\r\nold charm....\"\r\n\r\nShe was lamenting the death of her cousin and childhood playfellow, Dr.\r\nValentine Mott Francis, when \"a much greater affliction\" fell upon her\r\nin the death of her son-in-law, David Prescott Hall. \"This hurts me,\"\r\nshe writes, \"like a physical pain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _To Florence_\r\n\r\n                                         OAK GLEN, July 3, 1907.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST DEAR FLOSSY,--\r\n\r\nYou are quite right in saying that we greatly need the consoling belief\r\nin a future life to help us bear the painful separation which death\r\nbrings. Surely, the dear Christ believed in immortality, and promised it\r\nto faithful souls. I have myself derived great comfort from this belief,\r\nalthough I must confess that I know nothing about it. You may remember\r\nwhat [Downer] said to your dear father: \"I don't know anything about it,\r\nbut Jesus Christ certainly believed in immortality, and I pin my faith\r\non him, and _run for luck_.\"... Alice and her trio of babes came safe to\r\nhand this morning. Frances at once began to spread the gravel from\r\noutdoors on the best staircase, but desisted when forbidden to do\r\nso.... Farewell, dearest child. You have had a grievous loss, and will\r\nfeel it more and more. We must trust in God, and take our sorrows\r\nbelieving in the loving fatherhood. Maud writes me that she suffers an\r\n_irreparable_ loss in dear David's death....\r\n\r\n                                                Your loving\r\n                                                         MOTHER.\r\n\r\nMuch work was on hand this summer: a poem for Old Home Week in Boston,\r\nanother for the Cooperstown Centennial, a paper on the \"Elegant\r\nLiterature of Fifty Years Since,\" one for the \"Delineator\" on \"The Three\r\nGreatest Men I Have Known.\" These were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Theodore\r\nParker, and Dr. Howe. She spent much time and pains on this article. She\r\nread Elliot Cabot's \"Life of Emerson,\" which she thought \"certainly a\r\ngood piece of work, but deficient, it seems to me, in the romantic\r\nsympathy which is the true interpretation of Emerson and of all his\r\nkind.\"\r\n\r\nShe \"hammered\" hard on the two poems, with good results.\r\n\r\n\"_July 14._ I can hardly believe it, but my miserable verses, re-read\r\nto-day, seemed quite possible, if I can have grace to fill out their\r\nsketchiness. Last word ton-ight: I think I have got a poem. _Nil\r\ndesperandum!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 24._ Difficult to exaggerate the record of my worry this morning.\r\nI feel a painful uncertainty about going to Boston to read my poem for\r\nOld Home Week. Worse than this is my trouble about two poems sent me\r\nwhile in Boston, with original music, to be presented to the committee\r\nfor Home Week, which I have entirely forgotten and neglected. To do this\r\nwas far from my intention, but my old head fairly gave out in the\r\nconfusion of the various occasions in which I was obliged to take an\r\nactive part.\"\r\n\r\nShe yielded to entreaty and stayed at home, and was rewarded by \"a most\r\ngratifying letter from Edward Everett Hale, telling me that Josiah\r\nQuincy read my poem with real feeling, and that it was warmly received.\"\r\n\r\n\"My prayer is answered. I have lived to see my dear girl again.... I\r\ngive thanks earnestly and heartily, but seem for a time paralyzed by her\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\nWith the early autumn came a great pleasure in a visit to the new \"Green\r\nPeace,\" the house which her son had built at Bedford Hills, New York.\r\nShe was delighted with the house and garden; the Journal tells of all\r\nmanner of pleasant gayeties.\r\n\r\n\"_September 12._ Fannie had a luncheon party even pleasanter than\r\nyesterday's. Rev. Mr. Luquer is a grandson of Dominick Lynch, who used\r\nto come to my father's house in my childhood and break my heart by\r\nsinging 'Lord Ullin's Daughter.' I remember creeping under the piano\r\nonce to hide my tears. He sang all the Moore melodies with great\r\nexpression.... This, his descendant, looks a good deal like him. Was\r\nbred a lawyer. My good Uncle Cutler twice asked him whether he would\r\nstudy for the ministry. He said, 'No.' My uncle said the second time,\r\n'What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own\r\nsoul?' This word, he told me, came back to him. ... Worked a good deal\r\non my poem. At least thought and thought much, and altered a little.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the poem which prefaces this chapter and which was written for\r\nthe forthcoming Unitarian Convention in Boston. She had been at work on\r\nit for some time, first \"_trying to try for it_,\" and later \"hammering\"\r\nand polishing with great care. \"It came to me like a flash,\" she says,\r\n\"but had to be much thought over and corrected.\" And again, \"It was\r\ngiven to me something as was my 'Battle Hymn.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_October 25._ Wrote to a very bumptious child, thirteen years old, who\r\nproffers me her friendship and correspondence, claiming to have written\r\npoems and magazine contributions praised by 'noted authors.' I sent her\r\nback her letter, with three or four corrections and a little advice,\r\nkindly meant, but which may not be so taken.... She will probably turn\r\nand rend me, but I really felt it might do her good.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 14. Gardiner._ A good meditation. The sense of God in the\r\nuniverse seems to be an attribute of normal humanity. We cannot think of\r\nour own personal identity without at the same time imagining a greater\r\nself from which we derive. This idea may be crude and barbarous, great\r\nminds have done much to make it otherwise; Christ most of all with His\r\ndoctrine of divine love, providence, and forgiveness. The idea of a life\r\nbeyond this one seems also to appertain to normal humanity. We had best\r\naccept this great endowment which philosophy seeks to analyze much as a\r\nboy will take a watch to pieces, but cannot put it together again so\r\nthat it will work.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 15._ Another long sitting and meditation. What have\r\nindividual philosophers done for religion? As I recall what I could\r\nlearn of the Kantian philosophy, I think that it principally taught the\r\nlimitations of human knowledge, correcting thereby the assumptions of\r\nsystems of thought and belief to _absolute_ authority over the thinker\r\nand believer. He calls conscience 'the categorical imperative'; but that\r\nterm in no wise explains either the origin or authority of the moral\r\nlaw. His rule of testing the rectitude of the act by the way in which,\r\nif it were made universal, it would affect the well-being of society, is\r\nuseful, but simply pragmatic, not in William James's sense. The German\r\nidealism, the theory by which we evolve or create all that occupies our\r\nsenses and our mind, appears to me a monstrous expanse of egotism. No\r\ndoubt, dialectics serve as mental athletics, and speculative thought may\r\nbe useful as an exercise of the mental powers; but processes which may\r\nbe useful in this way might be very unfit to be held as permanent\r\npossessions of persuasion. It occurs to me that it might be more blessed\r\nto help the souls in hell than to luxuriate with saints in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 20. Boston._ Began my screed on the 'Joys of Motherhood' for\r\nthe 'Delineator.' Wrote _currente calamo_....\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 23._ Rather an off day. Found T. W. Higginson's little volume\r\nof verses, presented to me on my seventieth birthday, and read a good\r\ndeal in it. When the Colonel gave it to me, he read a little poem,\r\n'Sixty and Six,' very charmingly. Seems to me that I ought to have read\r\nthis little book through long before this time. One of the sweetest\r\npoems in it is about the blue-eyed baby that they lost after some six\r\nweeks' happy possession. I sent a pretty little baby wreath for it,\r\nfeeling very sorry for them both.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 28._ Much troubled about my Whittier poem.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 3._ Thanks be to God! I have written my Whittier rhyme. It\r\nhas cost me much labor, for I have felt that I could not treat a memory\r\nso reverend with cheap and easy verses. I have tried to take his\r\nmeasure, and to present a picture of him which shall deserve to\r\nlive.\"[150]\r\n\r\n  [150] This poem appears in _At Sunset_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Cobden-Sanderson, the English suffragists, were in Boston\r\nthis winter. They dined with her, and proved \"very agreeable. Mrs.\r\nSanderson's visit ought to help suffrage mightily, she is in such dead\r\nearnest for it. After dinner I proposed that each one should name his\r\nfavorite Browning poem. I named 'Pippa,' Mrs. Sanderson 'Paracelsus,'\r\nMr. S., 'The Grammarian's Funeral,' etc., etc. The talk was so good that\r\nwe could not stop it to hear the Victor, which I regretted.\"\r\n\r\nAnother delightful dinner of this winter was one given in her honor by\r\nher niece, Mrs. Richard Aldrich (Margaret Chanler), in New York. Among\r\nthe guests were Kneisel, the violinist, and Schelling, the pianist. Mrs.\r\nAldrich demanded \"Flibbertigibbet,\" and our mother played and recited it\r\nin such a manner that the two musicians were inspired to play, as the\r\npeople in the story were to dance. Kneisel flew home for his violin,\r\nSchelling sat down at the piano, and the two played Bach for her and to\r\nher delight.\r\n\r\n\"The occasion was memorable!\" she says.\r\n\r\nReturning from New York, she was able to attend the Whittier Centennial\r\nat Haverhill.\r\n\r\n\"_December 17._ ... Sanborn came to take me.... I have been praying to\r\nbe well for this occasion, my last public engagement for some weeks. I\r\nam thankful to have been able, at my advanced age, to read this poem at\r\nthe Whittier Celebration and to be assured by one present that I had\r\nnever been in better voice, and by others that I was generally heard\r\nwithout difficulty by the large audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 31._ Oh, blessed year 1907! It has been granted me to write\r\nfour poems for public occasions, all of which have proved acceptable;\r\nalso three fatiguing magazine articles, which have for the time bettered\r\nmy finances. I have lived in peace and goodwill with all men, and in\r\ngreat contentment with my own family, to which this year added a\r\npromising little great-grandson, taking away, alas! my dear son-in-law,\r\nDavid Prescott Hall. I found a very competent and friendly young\r\nmusician who has taken down nearly all my songs.... A word was given me\r\nto speak, namely, 'Thanks for the blessed, wonderful year just past.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\"MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THE GLORY OF THE COMING OF THE LORD\"\r\n\r\n1908-1910; _aet._ 89-91\r\n\r\n  I have made a voyage upon a golden river,\r\n    'Neath clouds of opal and of amethyst.\r\n  Along its banks bright shapes were moving ever,\r\n    And threatening shadows melted into mist.\r\n\r\n  The eye, unpractised, sometimes lost the current,\r\n    When some wild rapid of the tide did whirl,\r\n  While yet a master hand beyond the torrent\r\n    Freed my frail shallop from the perilous swirl.\r\n\r\n  Music went with me, fairy flute and viol,\r\n    The utterance of fancies half expressed,\r\n  And with these, steadfast, beyond pause or trial,\r\n    The deep, majestic throb of Nature's breast.\r\n\r\n  My journey nears its close--in some still haven\r\n    My bark shall find its anchorage of rest,\r\n  When the kind hand, which ever good has given,\r\n    Opening with wider grace, shall give the best.\r\n\r\n                                                   J. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grandchildren were her chief playmates when Maud was in Europe. To\r\nthem, the grave tone of the Journal, the tale of her public work, is\r\nalmost unbelievable, recalling, as they do, the household life, so warm,\r\nso rich, so intimate, it seemed enough in itself to fill the cup to\r\noverflowing. She had said of herself that in social activities she \"bled\r\nat every pore\": but in these later years it was light and warmth that\r\nshe shed around her, kindling whatever she touched. At her fire, as at\r\nUncle Sam's, we warmed our hands and our hearts. When she entered a\r\nroom, all faces lighted up, as if she carried a lamp in her hand.\r\n\r\nDay in, day out, she was the _Guter Camerad_. The desire _not to\r\nirritate_ had become so much a second nature that she was the easiest\r\nperson in the world to live with. If the domestic calm were disturbed,\r\n\"_Don't say anything!_\" was her word. \"_Wait a little!_\"\r\n\r\nShe might wake with the deep depression so often mentioned in the\r\nJournal. Pausing at her door to listen, one might hear a deep sigh, a\r\nplaintive ejaculation; but all this was put out of sight before she left\r\nher room, and she came down, as one of the grandchildren put it,\r\n\"bubbling like a silver tea-kettle.\"\r\n\r\nThen came the daily festival of breakfast, never to be hurried or\r\n\"scamped.\" The talk, the letters, some of which we might read to her,\r\ntogether with the newspaper. We see her pressing some tidbit on a child,\r\nwatching intently the eating of it, then, as the last mouthful\r\ndisappeared, exclaiming with tragic emphasis, \"_I wanted it!_\" Then, at\r\nthe startled face, would come peals of laughter; she would throw herself\r\nback in her chair, cover her face with her hands, and tap the floor with\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n\"Look at her!\" cried Maud. \"_Rippling with sin!_\"\r\n\r\nHow she loved to laugh!\r\n\r\n\"One day,\" says a granddaughter, \"the house was overflowing with guests,\r\nand she asked me to take my nap on her sofa, while she took hers on the\r\nbed. We both lay down in peace and tranquillity, but after a while, when\r\nshe thought I was asleep, I heard her laughing, until she almost wept.\r\nPresently she fell asleep, and slept her usual twenty minutes, to wake\r\nin the same gales of mirth. She laughed until the bed shook, but softly,\r\ntrying to choke her laughter, lest I should wake.\r\n\r\n\"'What is it about?' I asked. 'What is so wonderful and funny?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, my dear,' she said, breaking again into laughter, 'it is nothing!\r\nIt is the most ridiculous thing! I was only trying to translate\r\n\"fiddle-de-dee\" into Greek!'\"\r\n\r\nThis was in her ninety-second year.\r\n\r\nBut we are still at the breakfast table. Sometimes there were guests at\r\nbreakfast, a famous actor, a travelling scholar, caught between other\r\nengagements for this one leisure hour.\r\n\r\nIt was a good deal, perhaps, to ask people to leave a warm hotel on a\r\nJanuary morning; but it was warm enough by the soft-coal blaze of the\r\ndining-room fire. Over the coffee and rolls, sausages and buckwheat\r\ncakes, leisure reigned supreme; not the poet's \"retired leisure,\" but a\r\nfriendly and laughter-loving deity. Everybody was full of engagements,\r\nharried with work, pursued by business and pleasure: no matter! the talk\r\nranged high and far, and the morning was half gone before they\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nSoon after breakfast came the game of ball, played _à deux_ with\r\ndaughter or grandchild; the ball was tossed back and forth, the players\r\ncounting meanwhile up to ten in various languages. She delighted in\r\nadding to her vocabulary of numerals, and it was a good day when she\r\nmastered those of the Kutch-Kutch Esquimaux.\r\n\r\nThen came the walk, gallantly taken in every weather save the very\r\nworst. She battled with the west wind, getting the matter over as\r\nquickly as might be. \"_It is for my life!_\" she would say. But on quiet,\r\nsunny days she loved to linger along Commonwealth Avenue, watching the\r\nparade of babies and little children, stopping to admire this one or\r\nchat with that.\r\n\r\nThis function accomplished, she went straight to her desk, and \"P. T.\"\r\nreigned till noon. It was a less rigorous \"P. T.\" than that of our\r\nchildhood. She could break off in a moment now, give herself entirely,\r\njoyously, to the question of dinner for the expected guest, of dress for\r\nthe afternoon reception, then drop back into Aristotle or Æschylus with\r\na happy sigh. It was less easy to break off when she was writing; we\r\nmight be begged for \"half a moment,\" as if our time were fully as\r\nprecious as her own; but there was none of the distress that\r\ninterruption brought in earlier years. Perhaps she took her writing less\r\nseriously. She often said, \"Oh, my dear, I am beginning to realize at\r\nlast that I shall never write my book now, my Magnum Opus, that was to\r\nbe so great!\"\r\n\r\nShe practised her scales faithfully every day, through the later years.\r\nThen she would play snatches of forgotten operas, and the granddaughter\r\nwould hear her--if she thought no one was near--singing the brilliant\r\n_arias_ in \"a sweet thread of a voice.\"\r\n\r\nAfter her practising, if she were alone, she would sit at the window and\r\nplay her Twilight Game: counting the \"passing,\" one for a biped, two for\r\na quadruped, ten for a white horse, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, before the \"Victor\" concert, came the reading aloud:\r\nthis was one of her great pleasures. No history or philosophy for the\r\nevening reading; she must have a novel (not a \"problem novel\"; these she\r\ndetested!)--a good stirring tale, with plenty of action in it. She\r\nthrilled over \"With Fire and Sword,\" \"Kim,\" \"The Master of Ballantrae.\"\r\nShe could not bear to hear of financial anxieties or of physical\r\nsuffering. \"It gives me a pain in my knee!\"\r\n\r\nWe see her now, sitting a little forward in her straight-backed chair,\r\nholding the hand of the reading granddaughter, alert and tense. When a\r\ncatastrophe appears imminent, \"Stop a minute!\" she cries. \"I cannot bear\r\nit!\"--and the reader must pause while she gathers courage to face\r\ndisaster with the hero, or dash with him through peril to safety.\r\n\r\nShe would almost be sorry when the doorbell announced a visitor; almost,\r\nnot quite, for flesh and blood were better than fiction. If the caller\r\nwere a familiar friend, how her face lighted up!\r\n\r\n\"Oh! now we can have whist!\"\r\n\r\nThe table is brought out, the mother-of-pearl counters (a Cutler relic:\r\nwe remember that Mr. Ward did not allow cards in his house!), and the\r\norder for the rest of the evening is \"A clear fire, a clean hearth, and\r\nthe rigor of the game!\"--\r\n\r\nIt was a happy day when, as chanced once or twice, Mr. Ernest Schelling,\r\ncoming on from New York to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra,\r\noffered to come and play to her, \"all by herself, whatever she wanted,\r\nand for as long as she liked.\" She never forgot this pleasure, nor the\r\nwarm kindness of the giver.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Abel Lefranc, the French lecturer of the year at Harvard,\r\ncame to lunch with her. He apologized for only being able to stay for\r\nthe luncheon hour, owing to a press of engagements and work that had\r\ngrown overpowering. He stayed for two hours and a half after luncheon\r\nwas over, and during all that time the flow of poignant, brilliant talk,\r\n_à deux_, held the third in the little company absorbed. She was\r\nentirely at home in French, and the Frenchman talked over the problems\r\nof his country as if to a compatriot.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards a Baptist minister from Texas, a powerfully built\r\nand handsome man, came to wait on her. He also stayed two hours: and we\r\nheard his \"Amen!\" and \"Bless the Lord for that!\" and her gentler \"Bless\r\nthe Lord, indeed, my brother!\" as their voices, fervent and grave,\r\nmingled in talk.\r\n\r\nShe never tried to be interested in people. She _was_ interested, with\r\nevery fibre of her being. Little household doings: the economies and\r\nefforts of brave young people, she thrilled to them all. Indeed, all\r\n_human facts_ roused in her the same absorbed and reverent interest.\r\n\r\nThese are Boston memories, but those of Oak Glen are no less tender and\r\nvivid. There, too, the meals were festivals, the midday dinner being now\r\nthe chief one, with its following hour on the piazza; \"Grandmother\" in\r\nher hooded chair, with her cross-stitch embroidery or \"hooked\" rug,\r\ndaughters and grandchildren gathered round her. Horace and Xenophon\r\nwere on the little table beside her, but they must wait till she had\r\nmixed and enjoyed her \"social salad.\"\r\n\r\nAt Oak Glen, too, she had her novel and her whist, bézique or dominoes,\r\nas the family was larger or smaller. She never stooped to solitaire; a\r\ngame must be an affair of companionship, of the \"social tie\" in defence\r\nof which \"Bro' Sam,\" in his youth, had professed himself ready to die.\r\nInstead of the \"Victor\" concert, she now made music herself, playing\r\nfour-hand pieces with Florence, the \"music daughter,\" trained in\r\nchildhood by Otto Dresel. This was another great pleasure. (Did any one,\r\nwe wonder, ever _enjoy_ pleasures as she did?) These duets were for the\r\nafternoon; she almost never used her eyes in the evening. They were\r\nperfectly good, strong eyes; in the latter years she rarely used\r\nglasses; but the habit dated back to the early fifties, and might not be\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\nWe see her, therefore, in the summer afternoons, sitting at the piano\r\nwith Florence, playing, \"Galatea, dry thy tears!\" \"Handel's old tie-wig\r\nmusic,\" as she called his operas. Or, if her son were there, she would\r\nplay accompaniments from the \"Messiah\" or \"Elijah\"; rippling through the\r\ndifficult music, transposing it, if necessary to suit the singer's\r\nvoice, with ease and accuracy. Musicians said that she was the ideal\r\naccompanist, never asserting herself, but giving perfect sympathy and\r\nsupport to the singer.\r\n\r\nWe return to the Journal.\r\n\r\n\"_January, 1908._ I had prayed the dear Father to give me this one more\r\npoem, a verse for this year's Decoration Day, asked for by Amos Wells,\r\nof Christian Endeavor belonging. I took my pen and the poem came quite\r\nspontaneously. It seemed an answer to my prayer, but I hold fast the\r\nthought that the great Christ asked _no sign_ from God and needed none,\r\nso deeply did he enter into life divine. I also thought, regarding\r\nChrist and Moses, that we must be content that a certain mystery should\r\nenvelop these heroic figures of human history. Our small measuring tape\r\nor rod is not for them. If they were not exactly in fact what we take\r\nthem to be, let us deeply reverence the human mind which has conceived\r\nand built up such splendid and immortal ideals. Was not Christ thinking\r\nof something like this when he made the sin against the Holy Ghost and\r\nits manifestations the only unpardonable error? He surely did not mean\r\nto say that it was beyond the repentance which is the earnest of\r\nforgiveness to every sin.\"\r\n\r\nA day or two after this she met at luncheon \"a young Reverend Mr.\r\nFitch.... He is earnest and clear-minded, and should do much good. I\r\nspoke of the cup [of life], but advised him to use the spoon for\r\nstirring up his congregation.\"\r\n\r\nShe was asked for a \"long and exhaustive paper on Marion Crawford in\r\nabout a week. I wrote, saying that I could furnish an interesting paper\r\non the elder and younger Crawford, but without any literary estimate of\r\nMarion's work, saying that family praise was too much akin to\r\nself-praise; also the time allotted much too short.\"\r\n\r\nOne night she woke \"suddenly and something seemed to say, 'They are on\r\nthe right tack now.' This microscopic and detailed study of the causes\r\nof evil on society will be much forwarded by the direct agency of women.\r\nThey too will supply that inexhaustible element of hopefulness, without\r\nwhich reforms are a mere working back and forth of machinery. These two\r\nthings will overcome the evil of the world by prevention first, and then\r\nby the optimistic anticipation of good. This is a great work given to\r\nWoman now to do. Then I caught at various couplets of a possible\r\nmillennial poem, but feared I should not write it. Have scrawled these\r\non a large pad. This line kept coming back to me, 'Living, not dying,\r\nChrist redeemed mankind.'... This my first day at my desk since\r\nSaturday, March 28. I may try some prose about the present patient\r\nanalysis of the evil of society, the patient intelligent women\r\nassociated in all this work. To reclaim waste earth is a glory. Why not\r\na greater to reclaim the moral wastes of humanity?\"\r\n\r\nThis midnight vision impressed her deeply, and through the succeeding\r\ndays she wrote it out in full, bit by bit. On the envelope containing it\r\nis written, \"An account of my vision of the world regenerated by the\r\ncombined labor and love of Men and Women.\" In it she saw \"men and women\r\nof every clime working like bees to unwrap the evils of society and to\r\ndiscover the whole web of vice and misery and to apply the remedies, and\r\nalso to find the influences that should best counteract the evil and its\r\nattendant suffering.\r\n\r\n\"There seemed to be a new, a wondrous, ever-permeating light, the glory\r\nof which I cannot attempt to put into human words--the light of the\r\nnewborn hope and sympathy--blazing. The source of this light was born of\r\nhuman endeavor....\"\r\n\r\nShe saw \"the men and the women, standing side by side, shoulder to\r\nshoulder, a common lofty and indomitable purpose lighting every face\r\nwith a glory not of this earth. All were advancing with one end in view,\r\none foe to trample, one everlasting goal to gain....\r\n\r\n\"And then I saw the victory. All of evil was gone from the earth. Misery\r\nwas blotted out. Mankind was emancipated and ready to march forward in a\r\nnew Era of human understanding, all-encompassing sympathy and\r\never-present help, the Era of perfect love, of peace passing\r\nunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Humphry Ward was in Boston this spring, and there were many\r\npleasant festivities in her honor.\r\n\r\nA \"luncheon with Mrs. Humphry Ward at Annie Fields'; very pleasant.\r\nEdward Emerson there, easy and delightful....\"\r\n\r\nA fine reception at the Vendôme, where she and Mrs. Ward stood under \"a\r\nbeautiful arch of roses\" and exchanged greetings.\r\n\r\n\"A delightful call from Mrs. Humphry Ward. We had much talk of persons\r\nadmired in England and America. She has great personal attraction, is\r\nnot handsome, but very '_simpatica_' and is evidently whole-souled and\r\nsincere, with much 'good-fellowship.' We embraced at parting.\"\r\n\r\nIn strong contrast to this is her comment on a writer whose work did not\r\nappeal to her. \"But she has merit; yes, she certainly has merit. In\r\nfact--\" with a flash--\"she is meret-ricious!\"\r\n\r\nMay brought the Free Religious Banquet, at which she \"compared the\r\ndifference of sect to the rainbow which divides into its beauty the\r\nwhite light of truth\"; and the State Federation of Women's Clubs, where\r\nanother apt comparison occurred to her.\r\n\r\n\"I compared the old order among women to the juxtaposition of squares\r\nset cornerwise to each other; the intensity of personal feeling and\r\ninterest infusing an insensible antagonism into our relations with each\r\nother. 'Now,' I said, 'the comparison being removed, we no longer stand\r\ncornerwise to each other, but so that we can fit into line, and stand\r\nand act in concert.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"_Newport._ I begin to feel something of the 'labor and sorrow' of\r\nliving so long. I don't even enjoy my books as I used to. My efforts to\r\nfind a fit word for the Biennial [of the General Federation of Women's\r\nClubs, to meet in Boston, June 22 and 23] are not successful....\"\r\n\r\nShe soon revived under her green trees, and enjoyed her books as much as\r\never: \"got hold of\" her screed, wrote it, went up to Boston to deliver\r\nit, came back to meet an excursion party of \"Biennial\" ladies visiting\r\nNewport. (N.B. She was late for the reception, and her neighbor,\r\nBradford Norman, drove her into Newport in his automobile \"at a terrific\r\nclip.\" On alighting, \"Braddie,\" she said, \"if I were ten years younger,\r\nI would set up one of these hell-wagons myself!\")\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed all this hugely, but the fatigue was followed by distress so\r\ngreat that the next morning she \"thought she should die with her door\r\nlocked.\" (She _would_ lock her door: no prayers of ours availed against\r\nthis. In Boston, an elaborate arrangement of keys made it possible for\r\nher room to be entered; at Oak Glen there was but the one stout door. On\r\nthis occasion, after lying helpless and despairing for some time, she\r\nmanaged to unlock the door and call the faithful maid.)\r\n\r\nOn June 30 she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, beautiful last day of June! Perhaps my last June on earth.... I\r\nshall be thankful to live as long as I can be of comfort or help to any\r\none....\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 12...._ Sherman to Corse [Civil War], 'Can you hold out till I\r\narrive?' Corse to Sherman, 'I have lost an arm, my cheekbone, and am\r\nminus one ear, but I can lick _all hell_ yet.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_July 30._ Have felt so much energy to-day that thought I must begin\r\nupon my old philosophizing essays.... Could find only 'Duality of\r\nCharacter.' What is the lesson of this two-foldness? This, that the most\r\nexcellent person should remember the dual member of his or her firm, the\r\nevil possibility; and the most persistent offender should also remember\r\nthe better personality which is bound up with its opposite, and which\r\ncan come into activity, if invited to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 28._ Wrote an immediate reply to a Mrs. ----, who had written\r\nto ask leave to use a part of my 'Battle Hymn' with some verses of her\r\nown. I replied, refusing this permission, but saying that she should\r\nrewrite her own part sufficiently to leave mine out, and should not call\r\nit the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic.' The metre and tune, of course, she\r\nmight use, as they are not mine in any special sense, but my phrases\r\n_not_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter writing an article for the \"Delineator,\" on \"What I should like to\r\ngive my Country for a Christmas Gift,\" she dreads a failure of her\r\nproductive power, but is reassured by Maud's verdict. \"I took much pains\r\nwith it, but think she overpraises it a little to raise my spirits.\" The\r\ngift she would choose was \"a more vigilant national conscience.\" The\r\nlittle essay counts but seventy lines, but every word tells.\r\n\r\nIn early September she performed a \"very small public service,\"\r\nunveiling in Newport a bronze tablet in honor of Count de Rochambeau.\r\nShe would have been glad to speak, but an anxious daughter had demurred,\r\nand at the moment she \"only thought of pulling the string the right\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"_September 21. Green Peace, New York._ A delightful drive with Mr. Seth\r\nLow in his auto. A good talk with him about the multi-millionnaires and\r\nthe Hague Conferences which he has attended. We reached Green Peace in\r\ntime for Mr. Frank Potter to sing about half of my songs. He has a fine\r\ntenor voice, well cultivated, and is very kind about my small\r\ncompositions. I had not counted upon this pleasure. I dreaded this\r\nvisit, for the troublesome journey, but it has been delightful. I am\r\ncharmed to see my son so handsomely and comfortably established, and\r\nwith a very devoted wife. Potter brought me some flowers and a curious\r\norchid from Panama.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 3. Oak Glen._ Yesterday and to-day have had most exquisite\r\nsittings in front of my house in the warm sunshine; very closely wrapped\r\nup by the dear care of my daughters.\"\r\n\r\nThese sittings were on what she called her boulevard, a grassy space in\r\nfront of the house, bordering on the road, and taking the full strength\r\nof the morning sun. Here, with the tall screen of cedars behind her, and\r\na nut tree spreading its golden canopy over her head, she would sit for\r\nhours, drinking in the sweet air that was like no other to her.\r\n\r\nA companion picture to this is that of the twilight hour, when she would\r\nsit alone in the long parlor, looking out on the sunset. Black against\r\nthe glowing sky rose the pines of the tiny forgotten graveyard, where\r\nlong-ago neighbors slept, with the white rose tree drooping over the\r\nlittle child's grave; a spot of tender and melancholy beauty. All about\r\nwere the fields she loved, fragrant with clover and wormwood, vocal with\r\ntime-keeping crickets. Here she would sit for an hour, meditating, or\r\nrepeating to herself the Odes of Horace, or some familiar hymn. Horace\r\nwas one of her best friends, all her life long. She knew many of the\r\nOdes by heart, and was constantly memorizing new ones. They filled and\r\nbrightened many a sleepless or weary hour. Here, when the children came\r\nback from their walk, they would find her, quiet and serene, but ready\r\ninstantly to break into laughter with them, to give herself, as always,\r\nentirely and joyously. Now and then she wrote down a meditation; here is\r\none:--\r\n\r\n\"A thought comes to me to-day which gives me great comfort. This is\r\nthat, while the transitory incidentals of our life, important for the\r\nmoment, pass out of it, the steadfast divine life which is in our\r\nearthly experience, perseveres, and can never die nor diminish. I feel\r\ncontent that much of me should die. I interpret for myself Christ's\r\nparable of the tares sown in the wheat field. As regards the individual,\r\nthese tares are our personal and selfish traits and limitations. We must\r\nrestrain and often resist them, but we cannot and must not seek to\r\neradicate them, for they are important agents not only in preserving,\r\nbut also in energizing our bodily life. Yet they are, compared with our\r\nhigher life, as the tares compared with the wheat, and we must be well\r\ncontent to feel that, when the death harvest comes, these tares will\r\nfall from us and perish, while the wheat will be gathered into the\r\ngranary of God.\r\n\r\n\"I do not desire ecstatic, disembodied sainthood, because I do not wish\r\nto abdicate any one of the attributes of my humanity. I cherish even the\r\ninfirmities that bind me to my kind. I would be human, and American, and\r\na woman. Paul of Tarsus had one or two ecstasies, but I feel sure that\r\nhe lived in his humanity, strenuously and energetically. Indeed, the\r\nlist he gives us of his trials and persecutions may show us how much he\r\nlived as a man among men, even though he did once cry out for\r\ndeliverance from the body of death, whose wants and pains were a sore\r\nhindrance to him in his unceasing labors. That deliverance he found\r\ndaily in the service of Truth, and finally once for all, when God took\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Another thought upholds me. With the recurrence of the cycle, I feel\r\nthe steady tramp and tread of the world's progress. This Spring is not\r\nidentical with last Spring, this year is not last year. The predominant\r\nfact of the Universe is not the mechanical round and working of its\r\nforces, but their advance as moral life develops out of and above\r\nmaterial life. Mysterious as the chain of causation is, we know one\r\nthing about it, viz.: that we cannot reverse its sequence. Whatever may\r\nchange or pass away, my father remains my father, my child, my child.\r\nThe way before us is open--the way behind us is blocked with solid\r\nbuilding which cannot be removed. And in this great onward order, life\r\nturns not back to death, but goes forward to other life, which we may\r\ncall immortality. If I would turn backward, I stand still in paralyzed\r\nopposition to the mighty sweep of heavenly law. It must go on, and if I\r\ncould resist and refuse to go with it, I should die a moral death,\r\nhaving isolated myself from the movement which is life. But, do what I\r\nwill, I cannot resist it. I am carried on perforce, as inanimate rocks\r\nand trees are swept away in the course of a resistless torrent. Shall I\r\nthen abdicate my human privilege which makes the forces of nature Angels\r\nto help and minister to me? Let me, instead, take hold of the guiding\r\ncords of life with resolute hands and press onward, following the\r\nillustrious army whose crowned chiefs have gone before. They too had\r\ntheir weakness, their sorrow, their sin. But they are set as stars in\r\nthe firmament of God, and their torches flash heavenly light upon our\r\ndoubtful way, ay, even upon the mysterious bridge whose toll is silence.\r\nBeyond that silence reigns the perfect harmony.\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 6._ Expecting to leave this dear place to-morrow before noon,\r\nI write one last record in this diary to say that I am very thankful for\r\nthe season just at end, which has been busy and yet restful. I have seen\r\nold friends and new ones, all with pleasure, and mostly with profit of a\r\nsocial and spiritual kind. I have seen dear little Eleanor Hall, the\r\nsweetest of babies. Have had all of my dear children with me, some of my\r\ngrandchildren, and four of my great-grands.\r\n\r\n\"Our Papéterie has had pleasant meetings.... I am full of hope for the\r\nwinter. Have had a long season of fresh air, delightful and very\r\ninvigorating.... _Utinam! Gott in Himmel sei Dank!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_November 28. Boston._ Have been much troubled of late by uncertainties\r\nabout life beyond the present. Quite suddenly, very recently, it\r\noccurred to me to consider that Christ understood that spiritual life\r\nwould not end with death, and that His expressed certainty as to the\r\nfuture life was founded upon His discernment of spiritual things. So, in\r\nso far as I am a Christian, I must believe in the immortality of the\r\nsoul, as our Master surely did. I cannot understand why I have not\r\nthought of that before. I think now that I shall nevermore lose sight of\r\nit.... Had a very fine call from Mr. Locke, author of the 'Beloved\r\nVagabond,' a book which I have enjoyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"_December 5...._ I learned to-day that my dear friend of many years\r\n[the Reverend Mary H. Graves] passed away last night very peacefully....\r\nThis is a heart sorrow for me. She has been a most faithful,\r\naffectionate and helpful friend. I scarcely know whether any one,\r\noutside of my family, would have pained me more by their departure....\"\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a loss. \"Saint Mouse,\" as we called her, was a familiar\r\nfriend of the household: a little gray figure, with the face of a plain\r\nangel. For many years she had been the only person who was allowed to\r\ntouch our mother's papers. She often came for a day or two and\r\nstraightened out the tangle. She was the only approach to a secretary\r\never tolerated.\r\n\r\nWe used to grieve because our mother had no first-rate \"Crutch\"; it\r\nseemed a waste of power. Now, we see that it was partly the instinct of\r\nself-preservation,--keeping the \"doing\" muscles tense and strong,\r\nbecause action was vital and necessary to her--partly the still deeper\r\ninstinct of giving her _self_, body and mind. She seldom failed in any\r\nimportant thing she undertook; the \"chores\" of life she often left for\r\nothers to attend to or neglect.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas services, the Christmas oratorio, brought her the usual\r\nserene joy and comfort. She insists that Handel wrote parts of the\r\n\"Messiah\" in heaven itself. \"Where else could he have got 'Comfort ye,'\r\n'Thy rebuke,' 'Thou shalt break them,' and much besides?\"\r\n\r\nLate in December, 1908, came the horror of the Sicilian earthquake. She\r\nfelt at first that it was impossible to reconcile omnipotence and\r\nperfect benevolence with this catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"We must hold judgment in suspense and say, 'We don't and we can't\r\nunderstand.'\"\r\n\r\nShe had several tasks on hand this winter, among them a poem for the\r\nCentenary of Lincoln's birth. On February 7 she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"After a time of despair about the poem for the Lincoln Centenary some\r\nlines came to me in the early morning. I arose, wrapped myself warmly,\r\nand wrote what I could, making quite a beginning.\"\r\n\r\nShe finished the poem next day, and on the 12th she went \"with three\r\nhandsome grandchildren\" to deliver it at Symphony Hall before the Grand\r\nArmy of the Republic and their friends.\r\n\r\n\"The police had to make an entrance for us. I was presently conducted to\r\nmy seat on the platform. The hall was crammed to its utmost capacity. I\r\nhad felt doubts of the power of my voice to reach so large a company,\r\nbut strength seemed to be given to me at once, and I believe that I was\r\nheard very well. T. W. H. [Colonel Higginson] came to me soon after my\r\nreading and said, 'You have been a good girl and behaved yourself\r\nwell.'\"\r\n\r\nThe next task was an essay on \"Immortality,\" which cost her much labor\r\nand anxious thought.\r\n\r\n\"_March 3...._ Got at last some solid ground for my screed on\r\n'Immortality.' Our experience of the goodness of God in our daily life\r\nassures us of His mercy hereafter, and seeing God everywhere, we shall\r\ndwell in the house of the Lord forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"_March 27._ I am succeeding better with my 'Immortality' paper. Had\r\nto-day a little bit of visioning with which I think that I would\r\nwillingly depart, when my time comes. The dreadful fear of being buried\r\nalive disappeared for a time, and I saw only the goodness of God, to\r\nwhich it seemed that I could trust all question of the future life. I\r\nsaid to myself--'The best will be for thee and me.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this mood that she wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I, for one, feel that my indebtedness grows with my years. And it\r\noccurred to me the other day that when I should depart from this earthly\r\nscene, 'God's poor Debtor' might be the fittest inscription for my\r\ngravestone, if I should have one. So much have I received from the great\r\nGiver, so little have I been able to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 5...._ Heard May Alden Ward, N.E.W.C., on 'Current Events.'\r\n_Praecipuë_ tariff reform. Proposed a small group to study the question\r\nfrom the point of view of the consumer. What to protect and how?\r\nAmerican goods cheaper in Europe than here. Blank tells me of pencils\r\nmade here for a foreign market and sold in Germany and England at a\r\nprice impossible here. I said that the real bottomless pit is the depth\r\nof infamous slander with which people will assail our public servants,\r\nespecially when they are faithful and incorruptible, apropos of\r\naspersions cast on Roosevelt and Taft. Mrs. Ward read a very violent\r\nattack upon some public man of a hundred or more years ago. He was\r\nquoted as a monster of tyranny and injustice. His name was George\r\nWashington.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 8...._ My prayer for this Easter is that I may not waste the\r\ninspiration of spring....\"\r\n\r\nIn these days came another real sorrow to her.\r\n\r\n\"_April 10._ To-day brings the sad news of Marion Crawford's death at\r\nSorrento. His departure seems to have been a peaceful one. He comforted\r\nhis family and had his daughter Eleanor read Plato's 'Dialogues' to him.\r\nWas unconscious at the last. Poor dear Marion! The end, in his case,\r\ncomes early. His father was, I think, in the early forties when he died\r\nof a cancer behind the eye which caused blindness. He, Thomas Crawford,\r\nhad a long and very distressing illness.\"\r\n\r\nCrawford had been very dear to her, ever since the days when, a radiant\r\nschoolboy, he came and went in his vacations. There was a complete\r\nsympathy and understanding between them, and there were few people whom\r\nshe enjoyed more.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote a letter to be read, if approved, to-morrow evening at the\r\nFaneuil Hall meeting held to advocate the revision of our extradition\r\ntreaty with the Russian Government, which at present seems to allow that\r\ngovernment too much latitude of incrimination, whereby political and\r\ncivil offences can too easily be confused and a revolutionist\r\nsurrendered as a criminal, which he may or may not be.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the month she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"In the early morning I began to feel that I must attempt some sort of\r\ntribute to my dear friend of many years, Dr. Holmes, the centenary of\r\nwhose birth is to be celebrated on Tuesday next. I stayed at home from\r\nchurch to follow some random rhymes which came to me in connection with\r\nmy remembrance of my ever affectionate friend. I love to think of his\r\nbeautiful service to his age and to future ages. I fear that my rhymes\r\nwill fail to crystallize, but sometimes a bad beginning leads to\r\nsomething better....\"\r\n\r\nThe poem was finished, more or less to her satisfaction, but she was\r\nweary with working over it, and with \"reading heavy books, Max Müller on\r\nmetaphysics, Blanqui on political economy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 10._ I began this day the screed of 'Values' which I mentioned the\r\nother day. I have great hopes of accomplishing something useful,\r\nremembering, as I do, with sore indignation, my own mistakes, and\r\ndesiring to help young people to avoid similar ones.\"\r\n\r\nThe ninetieth birthday was a festival, indeed. Letters and telegrams\r\npoured in, rose in toppling piles which almost--not quite--daunted her;\r\nshe would hear every one, would answer as many as flesh and blood could\r\ncompass. Here is one of them:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMost hearty congratulations on your ninetieth birthday from the boy you\r\npicked up somewhere in New York and placed in the New York Orphan Asylum\r\non April 6th, 1841. Sorry I have never been able to meet you in all that\r\ntime. You [were] one of the Board of Trustees at that time.\r\n\r\n                             Respectfully and Thankfully,\r\n                                                   WM. DAVIDSON.\r\n\r\nI was then about five years old, now seventy-three.\r\n\r\nWriting to her friend of many years, Mrs. Ellen Mitchell, she says:--\r\n\r\n\"Your birthday letter was and is much valued by me. Its tone of earnest\r\naffection is an element in the new inspiration recently given me by such\r\na wonderful testimony of public and private esteem and goodwill as has\r\nbeen granted me in connection with my attainment of ninety years. It all\r\npoints to the future. I must work to deserve what I have received. My\r\ndearest wish would be to take up some thread of our A.A.W. work, and\r\ncontinue it. I rather hope that I may find the way to do this in the\r\nstudy of Economics which I am just starting with a small group....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                _To Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford_\r\n\r\nDEAR MRS. SPOFFORD,--\r\n\r\nYou wrote me a lovely letter on my ninetieth birthday. I cannot help\r\nfeeling as if the impression expressed by you and so many other kind\r\nfriends of my personal merits must refer to some good work which I have\r\nyet to do. What I have done looks small to me, but I have tried a good\r\ndeal for the best I have known. This is all I can say. I am much touched\r\nby your letter, and encouraged to go on trying. Don't you think that the\r\nbest things are already in view? The opportunities for women, the\r\ngrowing toleration and sympathy in religion, the sacred cause of peace?\r\nI have lived, like Moses, to see the entrance into the Promised Land.\r\nHow much is this to be thankful for! My crabbed hand shows how Time\r\nabridges my working powers, but I march to the brave music still, as\r\nyou and many of the juniors do.\r\n\r\nWishing that I might sometimes see you, believe me\r\n\r\n                         Yours with affectionate regard,\r\n                                                JULIA WARD HOWE.\r\n\r\n\r\nClose upon the Birthday came another occasion of the kind which we--in\r\nthese later years--at once welcomed and deplored. She enjoyed nothing so\r\nmuch as a \"function,\" and nothing tired her so much.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, Brown University, her husband's _alma mater_ and her\r\ngrandfather's, conferred upon her the degree of Doctor of Laws. She went\r\nto Providence to receive it in person, and thus describes the\r\ncommencement exercises to Mrs. Mitchell:--\r\n\r\n\"The ordeal of the Doctorate was rather trying, but was made as easy as\r\npossible for me. The venerable old church was well filled, and was quite\r\nbeautiful. I sat in one of the front pews--two learned people led me to\r\nthe foot of the platform from which President Faunce, with some\r\nlaudatory remarks, handed me my diploma, while some third party placed a\r\npicturesque hood upon my shoulders. The band played the air of my\r\n'Battle Hymn,' and applause followed me as I went back to my seat. So\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\nHer companion on that occasion writes:--\r\n\r\n\"She sat listening quietly to the addresses, watched each girl and boy\r\njust starting on the voyage of life as they marched to the platform and\r\nreceived from the President's hand the scrap of paper, the parchment\r\ndiploma, reward of all their studies. Her name was called last. With\r\nthe deliberate step of age, she walked forward, wearing her son's\r\ncollege gown over her white dress, his mortar-board cap over her lace\r\nveil. She seemed less moved than any person present; she could not see\r\nwhat we saw, the tiny gallant figure bent with fourscore and ten years\r\nof study and hard labor. As she moved between the girl students who\r\nstood up to let her pass, she whispered, 'How tall they are! It seems to\r\nme the girls are much taller than they used to be.' Did she realize how\r\nmuch shorter she was than she once had been? I think not.\r\n\r\n\"Then, her eyes sparkling with fun while all other eyes were wet, she\r\nshook her hard-earned diploma with a gay gesture in the faces of those\r\ngirls, cast on them a keen glance that somehow was a challenge, 'Catch\r\nup with me if you can!'\r\n\r\n\"She had labored long for the higher education of women, suffered\r\nestrangement, borne ridicule for it--the sight of those girl graduates,\r\nstarting on their life voyage equipped with a good education, was like a\r\nsudden realization of a life-long dream; uplifted her, gave her strength\r\nfor the fatigues of the day. At the dinner given for her and the college\r\ndignitaries by Mrs. William Goddard, she was at her best.\"\r\n\r\nShe was asked for a Fourth of July message to the Sunday-School children\r\nof the Congregational Church, and wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I want them to build up character in themselves and in the community,\r\nto give to the country just so many men and women who will be incapable\r\nof meanness or dishonesty, who will look upon life as a sacred trust,\r\ngiven to them for honorable service to their fellow men and women. I\r\nwould have them feel that, whether rich or poor, they are bound to be of\r\nuse in their day and generation, and to be mindful of the Scripture\r\nsaying that 'no man liveth unto himself.' We all have our part to do in\r\nkeeping up the character and credit of our country. For her sake we\r\nshould study to become good and useful citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1909 the Cretan question came up again. Once more\r\nTurkey attempted to regain active possession of Crete; once more the\r\nvoice of Christendom was raised in protest. She had no thought this time\r\nof being \"too old.\" Being called upon for help, she wrote at once to\r\nPresident Taft, \"praying him to find some way to help the Cretans in the\r\nterrible prospect of their being delivered over, bound hand and foot, to\r\nTurkish misrule.\" She was soon gladdened by a reply from the President,\r\nsaying that he had not considered the Cretans as he should, but\r\npromising to send her letter to the Secretary of State. \"I thank God\r\nmost earnestly,\" she writes, \"for even thus much. To-day, I feel that I\r\nmust write all pressing letters, as my time may be short.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly she composed an open letter on the Cretan question. \"It is\r\nrather crude, but it is from my heart of hearts. I had to write it.\"\r\n\r\nSuffrage, too, had its share of her attention this summer. There were\r\nmeetings at \"Marble House\" [Newport] in which she was deeply interested.\r\nShe attended one in person; to the next she sent the second and third\r\ngenerations, staying at home herself to amuse and care for the fourth.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of August she records once more her sorrow at the\r\ndeparture of the summer. She adds, \"God grant me to be prepared to live\r\nor die, as He shall decree. It is best, I think, to anticipate life, and\r\nto cultivate forethought.... I think it may have been to-day that I read\r\nthe last pages of Martineau's 'Seat of Authority in Religion,' an\r\nextremely valuable book, yet a painful one to read, so entirely does it\r\ndo away with the old-time divinity of the dear Christ. But it leaves Him\r\nthe divinity of character--no theory or discovery can take that away.\"\r\n\r\nLate September brought an occasion to which she had looked forward with\r\nmingled pleasure and dread; the celebration of the Hudson-Fulton\r\nCentennial in New York. She had been asked for a poem, and had taken\r\ngreat pains with it, writing and re-writing it, hammering and polishing.\r\nShe thought it finished in July, yet two days before the celebration she\r\nwas still re-touching it.\r\n\r\n\"I have been much dissatisfied with my Fulton poem. Lying down to rest\r\nthis afternoon, instead of sleep, of which I felt no need, I began to\r\ntry for some new lines which should waken it up a little, and think that\r\nI succeeded. I had brought no manuscript paper, so had to scrawl my\r\namendments on Sanborn's old long envelope.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the day two more lines came to her, and again two the day\r\nafter. Finally, on the morning of the day itself, on awakening, she\r\ncried out,--\r\n\r\n\"I have got my last verse!\"\r\n\r\nThe occasion was a notable one. The stage of the Metropolitan Opera\r\nHouse was filled with dignitaries, delegates from other States, foreign\r\ndiplomats in brilliant uniforms. The only woman among them was the\r\nlittle figure in white, to greet whom, as she came forward on her son's\r\narm, the whole great assembly rose and stood. They remained standing\r\nwhile she read her poem in clear unfaltering tones; the applause that\r\nrang out showed that she had once more touched the heart of the public.\r\n\r\nThis poem was printed in \"Collier's Weekly,\" unfortunately from a copy\r\nmade before the \"last verse\" was finished to her mind. This distressed\r\nher. \"Let this be a lesson!\" she said. \"Never print a poem or speech\r\ntill it has been delivered; always give the eleventh hour its chance!\"\r\n\r\nThis eleventh hour brought a very special chance; a few days before, the\r\nworld had been electrified by the news of Peary's discovery of the North\r\nPole: it was the general voice that cried through her lips,--\r\n\r\n  The Flag of Freedom crowns the Pole!\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written while she was at work on the poem:--\r\n\r\n                                _To Laura_\r\n\r\n                                         OAK GLEN, July 9, 1909.\r\n\r\nWhy, yes, I'm doing the best I know how. Have written a poem for the\r\nHudson and Fulton celebration, September 28. Worked hard at it. Guess\r\nit's only pretty good, if even that. Maud takes me out every day under\r\nthe pine tree, makes me sit while she reads aloud Freeman's shorter work\r\non Sicily. I enjoy this.... I have just read Froude's \"Cæsar,\" which\r\nSanborn says he hates, but which I found as readable as a novel. Am also\r\nreading a work of Kuno Fischer on \"Philosophy,\" especially relating to\r\nDescartes. Now you know, Miss, or should know, that _same_ had great\r\n_fame_, and sometimes _blame_, as a philosopher. But he don't make no\r\nimpression on my mind. I never doubted that I was, so don't need no\r\n\"_cogito, ergo sum,_\" which is what Carty, old Boy, amounts to. Your\r\nletter, dear, was a very proper attention under the circumstances.\r\nShouldn't object to another. Lemme see! objects cannot be subjects, nor\r\n_vice versa_. How do you know that you washed your face this morning?\r\nYou don't know it, and I don't believe that you did. You might consult\r\nH. Richards about some of these particulars. He is a man of some sense.\r\nYou are, bless you, not much wiser than your affectionate\r\n\r\n                                                             MA.\r\n\r\nReturned to Oak Glen, after the celebration, she writes:--\r\n\r\n                   _To her son and his wife_\r\n\r\n                                      OAK GLEN, October 1, 1909.\r\n\r\n... I found my trees still green, and everything comfortable. I did not\r\ndare to write to any one yesterday, my head was so full of nonsense.\r\nReaction from brain-fatigue takes this shape with me, and everything\r\ngoes \"higgle-wiggledy, hi-cockalorum,\" or words to that effect.... We\r\nhad a delightful visit with you, dear F. G. and H. M. I miss you both,\r\nand miss the lovely panorama of the hills, and the beauteous flower\r\nparterres. Well, here's for next year in early Autumn, and I hope I may\r\nsee you both before that time. With thanks for kindest entertainment,\r\nand best of love,\r\n\r\n                          Your very affectionate\r\n                                        MOTHER AND DITTO-IN-LAW.\r\n\r\n                              _To George H. Richards_[151]\r\n\r\n                                      OAK GLEN, October 1, 1909.\r\n\r\nDEAR UNCLE GEORGE,--\r\n\r\nI got through all right, in spite of prospective views, of fainting\r\nfits, apoplexy, what not? Trouble is now that I cannot keep calling up\r\nsome thousands of people, and saying: \"Admire me, do. I wrote it all my\r\nlittle own self.\" Seriously, there is a little reaction from so much\r\nexcitement. But I hope to recover my senses in time. I improved the last\r\ntwo stanzas much when I recited the poem. The last line read\r\n\r\n  The Flag of Freedom crowns the Pole!\r\n\r\nI tell you, I brought it out with a will, and they all [the audience]\r\nmade a great noise....\r\n\r\n  [151] Her man of business and faithful friend. Though of her children's\r\ngeneration, she had adopted him as an \"uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe doubt if any of the compliments pleased her so much as that of the\r\nIrish charwoman who, mop in hand, had been listening at one of the side\r\ndoors of the theatre. \"Oh, you dear little old lady!\" she cried. \"You\r\nspeaked your piece _real_ good!\"\r\n\r\nLate October finds her preparing for the move to Boston.\r\n\r\n\"I have had what I may call a spasm of gratitude to God for His great\r\ngoodness to me, sitting in my pleasant little parlor, with the lovely\r\ngolden trees in near view, and the devotion of my children and great\r\nkindness of my friends well in mind. Oh! help me, divine Father, to\r\nmerit even a very little of Thy kindness!\"\r\n\r\nIn this autumn she was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts\r\nand Letters, and in December she wrote for its first meeting a poem\r\ncalled \"The Capitol.\" She greatly desired to read this poem before the\r\nassociation, and Maud, albeit with many misgivings, agreed to take her\r\non to Washington. This was not to be. On learning of her intention,\r\nthree officers of the association, William Dean Howells, Robert\r\nUnderwood Johnson, and Thomas Nelson Page, sent her a \"round-robin\"\r\ntelegram, begging her not to run the risk of the long winter journey.\r\nThe kindly suggestion was not altogether well taken. \"Ha!\" she flashed\r\nout. \"They think I am too old, but there's a little ginger left in the\r\nold blue jar!\"\r\n\r\nShe soon realized the wisdom as well as the friendliness of the round\r\nrobin, and confided to the Journal that she had been in two minds about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day she writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to God who gave us the blessed Christ. What a birth was this!\r\nTwo thousand years have only increased our gratitude for it. How it has\r\nconsecrated Babyhood and Maternity! Two infants, grown to man's estate,\r\ngovern the civilized world to-day, Christ and Moses. I am still thankful\r\nto be here in the flesh, as they were once, and oh! that I may never\r\npass where they are not!\"\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1909-10 was a severe one, and she was more or less housed;\r\nyet the days were full and bright for her. \"Life,\" she cried one day,\r\n\"is like a cup of tea; all the sugar is at the bottom!\" and again, \"Oh!\r\nI must go so soon, and I am only just ready to go to college!\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was too cold for her to go out, she took her walk in the house,\r\nwith the windows open, pacing resolutely up and down her room and the\r\nroom opposite. She sat long hours at her desk, in patient toil. She was\r\nalways picking up dropped stitches, trying to keep every promise, answer\r\nevery note.\r\n\r\n\"Went through waste-paper basket, redeeming some bits torn to fragments,\r\nwhich either should be answered or recorded. Wrote an autograph for Mr.\r\nBlank. It was asked for in 1905. Had been _put away_ and forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nShe got too tired that morning, and could not fully enjoy the Authors'\r\nClub in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Higginson and I sat like two superannuated old idols. Each of\r\nus said a little say when the business was finished.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not recalled that they presented any such appearance to others.\r\n\r\nShe went to the opera, a mingled pleasure and pain.\r\n\r\n\"It was the 'Huguenots,' much of which was known to me in early youth,\r\nwhen I used to sing the 'Rataplan' chorus with my brothers. I sang also\r\nValentine's prayer, '_Parmi les fleurs mon rêve se ranime_,' with\r\nobligato bassoon accompaniment, using the 'cello instead. I know that I\r\nsang much better that night than usual, for dear Uncle John said to me,\r\n'You singed good!' Poor Huti played the 'cello. Now, I listened for the\r\nfamiliar bits, and recognized the drinking chorus in Act 1st, the\r\n'Rataplan' in Act 2d. Valentine's prayer, if given, was so overlaid with\r\n_fioritura_ that I did not feel sure of it. The page's pretty song was\r\nall right, but I suffered great fatigue, and the reminiscences were\r\nsad.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the winter she continued the study of economics with some\r\nfifteen members of the New England Woman's Club. She read Bergson too,\r\nand now and then \"got completely bogged\" in him, finding no \"central\r\npoint that led anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time she wrote:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Some Rules for Everyday Life_\r\n\r\n\"1. Begin every day with a few minutes of retired meditation, tending to\r\nprayer, in order to feel within yourself the spiritual power which will\r\nenable you to answer the demands of practical life.\r\n\r\n\"2. Cultivate systematic employment and learn to estimate correctly the\r\ntime required to accomplish whatever you may undertake.\r\n\r\n\"3. Try to occupy both your mind and your muscles, since each of these\r\nwill help the other, and both deteriorate without sufficient exercise.\r\n\r\n\"4. Remember that there is great inherent selfishness in human nature,\r\nand train yourself to consider adequately the advantage and pleasure of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"5. Be thankful to be useful.\r\n\r\n\"6. Try to ascertain what are real uses, and to follow such maxims and\r\nmethods as will stand the test of time, and not fail with the passing\r\naway of a transient enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"7. Be neither over distant nor over familiar in your intercourse;\r\nfriendly rather than confidential; not courting responsibility, but not\r\ndeclining it when it of right belongs to you.\r\n\r\n\"8. Be careful not to falsify true principles by a thoughtless and\r\ninsufficient application of them.\r\n\r\n\"9. Though actions of high morality ensure in the end the greatest\r\nsuccess, yet view them in the light of obligation, not in that of\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\"10. Whatever your talents may be, consider yourself as belonging to the\r\naverage of humanity, since, even if superior to many in some respects,\r\nyou will be likely to fall below them in others.\r\n\r\n\"11. Remember the Christian triad of virtues. Have faith in principles,\r\nhope in God, charity with and for all mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA windy March found her \"rather miserably ailing.\" Dr. Langmaid came,\r\nand pronounced her lungs \"sound as a bass drum\"; nothing amiss save a\r\nthroat irritated by wind and dust. Thereupon she girded herself and\r\nbuckled to her next task, a poem for the centenary of James Freeman\r\nClarke.\r\n\r\n\"I have despaired of a poem which people seem to expect from me for the\r\ndear James Freeman's centennial. To-day the rhymes suddenly flowed, but\r\nthe thought is difficult to convey--the reflection of heaven in his soul\r\nis what he gave, and what he left us.\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 1._ Very much tossed up and down about my poem....\"\r\n\r\n\"_April 2._ Was able at last, _D.G._, to make the poem explain itself.\r\nRosalind, my incorruptible critic, was satisfied with it. I think and\r\nhope that all my trouble has been worth while. I bestowed it most\r\nunwillingly, having had little hope that I could make my figure of\r\nspeech intelligible. I am very thankful for this poem, cannot be\r\nthankful enough.\"\r\n\r\nThis was her third tribute to the beloved Minister, and is, perhaps, the\r\nbest of the three. The thought which she found so difficult of\r\nconveyance is thus expressed:--\r\n\r\n  Lifting from the Past its veil,\r\n  What of his does now avail?\r\n  Just a mirror in his breast\r\n  That revealed a heavenly guest,\r\n  And the love that made us free\r\n  Of the same high company.\r\n  These he brought us, these he left,\r\n  When we were of him bereft.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe thus describes the occasion:--\r\n\r\n\"Coughed in the night, and at waking suffered much in mind, fearing that\r\na wild fit of coughing might make my reading unacceptable and even\r\nridiculous. Imagine my joy when I found my voice clear and strong, and\r\nread the whole poem [forty-four lines] without the slightest inclination\r\nto cough. This really was the granting of my prayer, and my first\r\nthought about it was, 'What shall I render to the Lord for all His\r\ngoodness to me?' I thought, 'I will interest myself more efficiently in\r\nthe great questions which concern Life and Society at large.' If I have\r\n'the word for the moment,' as some think, I will take more pains to\r\nspeak it.\"\r\n\r\nA little later came a centenary which--alas!--she did not enjoy. It was\r\nthat of Margaret Fuller, and was held in Cambridge. She was asked to\r\nattend it, and was assured that she \"would not be expected to speak.\"\r\nThis kindly wish to spare fatigue to a woman of ninety-one was the last\r\nthing she desired. She could hardly believe that she would be left\r\nout--she, who had known Margaret, had talked and corresponded with her.\r\n\r\n\"They have not asked me to speak!\" she said more than once as the time\r\ndrew near.\r\n\r\nShe was reassured; of course they would ask her when they saw her!\r\n\r\n\"I have a poem on Margaret!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it with you! Of course you will be asked to say something, and\r\nthen you will be all ready with your poem in your pocket.\"\r\n\r\nThus Maud, in all confidence. Indeed, if one of her own had gone with\r\nher, the matter would have been easily arranged; unfortunately, the\r\ncompanion was a friend who could make no motion in the matter. She\r\nreturned tired and depressed. \"They did not ask me to speak,\" she said,\r\n\"and I was the only person present who had known Margaret and remembered\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nFor a little while this incident weighed on her. She felt that she was\r\n\"out of the running\"; but a winning race was close at hand.\r\n\r\nThe question of pure milk was before the Massachusetts Legislature, and\r\nwas being hotly argued. An urgent message came by telephone; would Mrs.\r\nHowe say a word for the good cause? Maud went to her room, and found her\r\nat her desk, the morning's campaign already begun.\r\n\r\n\"There is to be a hearing at the State House on the milk question; they\r\nwant you dreadfully to speak. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me half an hour!\" she said.\r\n\r\nBefore the half-hour was over she had sketched out her speech and\r\ndressed herself in her best flowered silk cloak and her new lilac hood,\r\na birthday gift from a poor seamstress. Arrived at the State House, she\r\nsat patiently through many speeches. Finally she was called on to speak;\r\nit was noticed that no oath was required of her. As she rose and came\r\nforward on her daughter's arm,--\"You may remain seated, Mrs. Howe,\" said\r\nthe benevolent chairman.\r\n\r\n\"I prefer to stand!\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nShe had left her notes behind; she did not need them. Standing in the\r\nplace where, year after year, she had stood to ask for the full rights\r\nof citizenship, she made her last thrilling appeal for justice.\r\n\r\n\"We have heard,\" she said, \"a great deal about the farmers' and the\r\ndealers' side of this case. We want the matter settled on the ground of\r\njustice and mercy; it ought not to take long to settle what is just to\r\nall parties. Justice to all! Let us stand on that. There is one deeply\r\ninterested party, however, of whom we have heard nothing. He cannot\r\nspeak for himself; I am here to speak for him: the infant!\"\r\n\r\nThe effect was electrical. In an instant the tired audience, the dull or\r\ndogged or angry debaters, woke to a new interest, a new spirit. No\r\nfarmer so rough, no middle-man so keen, no legislator so apathetic, but\r\nfelt the thrill. In a silence charged with deepest feeling all listened\r\nas to a prophetess, as, step by step, she unfolded the case of the\r\ninfant as against farmers and dealers.\r\n\r\nAs Arthur Dehon Hill, counsel for the Pure Milk Association, led her\r\nfrom the room, he said, \"Mrs. Howe, you have saved the day!\"\r\n\r\nThis incident was still in her mind on her ninety-first birthday, a few\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\n\"My parlors are full of beautiful flowers and other gifts, interpreted\r\nby notes expressive of much affection, and telegrams of the same sort.\r\nWhat dare I ask for more? Only that I may do something in the future to\r\ndeserve all this love and gratitude. I have intended to deserve it all\r\nand more. Yet, when in thought I review my life, I feel the waste and\r\nloss of power thro' want of outlook. Like many another young person, I\r\ndid not know what my really available gifts were. Perhaps the best was a\r\nfeeling of what I may call 'the sense of the moment,' which led a French\r\nfriend to say of me: '_Mme. Howe possède le mot à un dégré\r\nremarquable._' I was often praised for saying 'just the right word,'\r\nand I usually did this with a strong feeling that it ought to be said.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in June, just as she was preparing for the summer flitting, she\r\nhad a bad fall, breaking a rib. This delayed the move for a week, no\r\nmore, the bone knitting easily. She was soon happy among her green\r\ntrees, her birds singing around her.\r\n\r\nThe memories of this last summer come flocking in, themselves like\r\nbright birds. She was so well, so joyous, giving her lilies with such\r\nfull hands; it was a golden time.\r\n\r\nAs the body failed, the mind--or so it seemed to us--grew ever clearer,\r\nthe veil that shrouds the spirit ever more transparent. She \"saw things\r\nhidden.\"\r\n\r\nOne day a summer neighbor came, bringing her son, a handsome, athletic\r\nfellow, smartly dressed, a fine figure of gilded youth. She looked at\r\nhim a good deal: presently she said suddenly,--\r\n\r\n\"You write poetry!\"\r\n\r\nThe lad turned crimson: his mother looked dumfounded. It proved that he\r\nhad lately written a prize poem, and that literature was the goal of his\r\nambition. Another day she found a philosopher hidden in what seemed to\r\nthe rest of the family merely \"a callow boy in pretty white duck\r\nclothes.\" So she plucked out the heart of each man's mystery, but so\r\ntenderly that it was yielded gladly, young and old alike feeling\r\nthemselves understood.\r\n\r\nAmong the visitors of this summer none was more welcome than her\r\ngreat-grandson, Christopher Birckhead,[152] then an infant in arms. She\r\nloved to hold and watch the child, brooding over him with grave\r\ntenderness: it was a beautiful and gracious picture of Past and Future.\r\n\r\n  [152] Son of Caroline Minturn (Hall) and the Reverend Hugh Birckhead.\r\n\r\nMaud had just written a book on Sicily, and, as always, our mother read\r\nand corrected the galley proofs. She did this with exquisite care and\r\nthoughtfulness, never making her suggestions on the proof itself, but on\r\na separate sheet of paper, with the number of the galley, the phrase,\r\nand her suggested emendations. This was her invariable custom: the\r\nwriter must be perfectly free to retain her own phrase, if she preferred\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWalking tired her that summer, but she was very faithful about it.\r\n\r\n\"Zacko,\" she would command John Elliott, \"take me for a walk.\"\r\n\r\nThe day before she took to her bed, he remembers that she clung to him\r\nmore than usual and said,--\r\n\r\n\"It tires me very much.\" (This after walking twice round the piazza.)\r\n\r\n\"Once more!\" he encouraged.\r\n\r\n\"No--I have walked all I can to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me take you back to your room this way,\" he said, leading her back\r\nby the piazza. \"That makes five times each way!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed and was pleased to have done this, but he thinks she had a\r\ngreat sense of weakness too.\r\n\r\nHer favorite piece on the \"Victor\" that summer was \"The Artillerist's\r\nOath.\" The music had a gallant ring to it, and there was something\r\nheroic about the whole thing, something that suggested the Forlorn\r\nHope--how many of them she had led! When nine o'clock came, she would\r\nask for this piece by the nickname she had given it, taken from one of\r\nits odd lines,--\r\n\r\n  \"I'll wed thee in the battle's front!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the song was being given, she was all alert and alive, even if she\r\nmay have been sleepy earlier in the evening. She would get up with a\r\nlittle gesture of courage, and take leave of us, always with a certain\r\nceremony, that was like the withdrawing of royalty. The evening was then\r\nover, and we too went to bed!\r\n\r\nAs we gather up our treasures of this last summer, we remember that\r\nseveral things might have prepared us for what was coming, had not our\r\neyes been holden. She spoke a great deal of old times, the figures of\r\nher childhood and girlhood being evidently very near to her. She quoted\r\nthem often; \"My grandma used to say--\" She spoke as naturally as the boy\r\nin the next room might speak of her.\r\n\r\nShe would not look in the glass; \"I don't like to see my old face!\" she\r\nsaid. She could not see the beauty that every one else saw. Yet she kept\r\nto the very last a certain tender coquetry. She loved her white dresses,\r\nand the flowered silk cloak of that last summer. She chose with care the\r\njewels suited to each costume, the topaz cross for the white, the\r\namethysts for the lilac. She had a great dread of old people's being\r\nuntidy or unprepossessing in appearance, and never grudged the moments\r\nspent in adjusting the right cap and lace collar.\r\n\r\nThere was an almost unearthly light in her face, a transparency and\r\nsweetness that spoke to others more plainly than to us: Hugh Birckhead\r\nsaw and recognized it as a look he had seen in other faces of saintly\r\nage, as their translation approached. But we said joyously to her and to\r\neach other, \"She will round out the century; we shall all keep the\r\nHundredth Birthday together!\" And we and she partly believed it.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had insisted strongly that she should keep, through the\r\nsummer at least, the trained nurse who had ministered to her after her\r\nfall. She \"heard what he said, but it made no difference.\" In early\r\nAugust she records \"a passage at arms with Maud, in which I clearly\r\nannounced my intention of dispensing with the services of a trained\r\nnurse, my good health and simple habits rendering it entirely\r\nunnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nShe threatened to write to her man of business.\r\n\r\n\"_I would rather die_,\" she said, \"than be an old woman with a nurse!\"\r\n\r\nMaud and Florence wept, argued, implored, but the nurse was dismissed.\r\nThe Journal acknowledges that \"her ministrations and Dr. Cobb's\r\ndiagnosis have been very beneficial to my bodily health.\" On the same\r\nday she records the visit of a Persian Prince, who had come to this\r\ncountry chiefly to see two persons, the President of the United States\r\nand Mrs. Julia Ward Howe. \"He also claims to be a reincarnation of some\r\nremarkable philosopher; and to be so greatly interested in the cause of\r\nPeace that he declines to visit our ships now in the harbor here, to\r\nwhich he has been invited.\"\r\n\r\nReading Theodore Parker's sermon on \"Wisdom and Intellect,\" she found it\r\nso full of notable sayings that she thought \"a little familiar book of\r\ndaily inspiration and aspiration\" might be made from his writings: she\r\nwrote to Mr. Francis J. Garrison suggesting this, and suggesting also,\r\nwhat had been long in her mind, the collecting and publishing of her\r\n\"Occasional Poems.\"\r\n\r\nIn late September, she was \"moved to write one or more open letters on\r\nwhat religion really is, for some one of the women's papers\"; and the\r\nnext day began upon \"What is Religion?\" or rather, \"What Sort of\r\nReligion makes Religious Liberty possible?\"\r\n\r\nA day or two later, she was giving an \"offhand talk\" on the early\r\nrecollections of Newport at the Papéterie, and going to an afternoon tea\r\nat a musical house, where, after listening to Schumann Romances and\r\nChopin waltzes, and to the \"Battle Hymn\" on the 'cello, she was moved to\r\ngive a performance of \"Flibbertigibbet.\" This occasion reminded her\r\nhappily of her father's house, of Henry \"playing tolerably on the\r\n'cello, Marion studying the violin, Bro' Sam's lovely tenor voice.\"\r\n\r\nNow came the early October days when she was to receive the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws from Smith College. She hesitated about making the\r\ntiresome journey, but finally, \"Grudging the trouble and expense, I\r\ndecide to go to Smith College, for my degree, but think I won't do so\r\nany more.\"\r\n\r\nShe started accordingly with daughter and maid, for Northampton,\r\nMassachusetts. It was golden weather, and she was in high spirits.\r\nVarious college dignitaries met her at the station; one of these had\r\ngiven up a suite of rooms for her use; she was soon established in much\r\npeace and comfort.\r\n\r\nWednesday, October 5, was a day of perfect autumn beauty. She was early\r\ndressed in her white dress, with the college gown of rich black silk\r\nover it, the \"mortar-board\" covering in like manner her white lace cap.\r\nThus arrayed, a wheeled chair conveyed her to the great hall, already\r\npacked with visitors and graduates, as was the deep platform with\r\ncollege officials and guests of honor. Opposite the platform, as if hung\r\nin air, a curving gallery was filled with white-clad girls, some two\r\nthousand of them; as she entered they rose like a flock of doves, and\r\nwith them the whole audience. They rose once more when her name was\r\ncalled, last in the list of those honored with degrees; and as she came\r\nforward, the organ pealed, and the great chorus of fresh young voices\r\nbroke out with\r\n\r\n  \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord--\"\r\n\r\nIt was the last time.\r\n\r\nLater in the day the students of Chapin House brought their guest-book,\r\nbegging for her autograph. She looked at Laura with a twinkle.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think they would like me to write something?\"\r\n\r\nAssured on that point, she waited a moment, and then wrote after her\r\nsignature,--\r\n\r\n  Wandered to Smith College\r\n  In pursuit of knowledge;\r\n  Leaves so much the wiser,\r\n  Nothing can surprise her!\r\n\r\nShe reached home apparently without undue fatigue. \"She will be more\r\ntired to-morrow!\" we said; but she was not. Her son came for the\r\nweek-end, and his presence was always a cordial. Sunday was a happy day.\r\nIn the evening we gathered round the piano, she playing, son and\r\ndaughters singing the old German student songs brought by \"Uncle Sam\"\r\nfrom Heidelberg seventy years before.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday she went to the Papéterie, and was the life and soul of\r\nthe party, sparkling with merriment. Driving home, it was so warm that\r\nshe begged to have the top of the carriage put back, and so she enjoyed\r\nthe crowning pageant of the autumn, the full hunter's moon and the\r\ncrimson ball of the sun both visible at once.\r\n\r\nWednesday found her busy at her desk, confessing to a slight cold, but\r\nmaking nothing of it. The next day bronchitis developed, followed by\r\npneumonia. For several days the issue seemed doubtful, the strong\r\nconstitution fighting for life. Two devoted physicians were beside her,\r\none the friend of many years, the other a young assistant. The presence\r\nof the latter puzzled her, but his youth and strength seemed tonic to\r\nher, and she would rest quietly with her hand in his strong hand.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday evening the younger physician thought her convalescent; the\r\nelder said, \"If she pulls through the next twenty-four hours, she will\r\nrecover.\"\r\n\r\nBut she was too weary. That night they heard her say, \"God will help\r\nme!\" and again, toward morning, \"I am so tired!\"\r\n\r\nBeing alone for a moment with Maud, she spoke one word: a little word\r\nthat had meant \"good-bye\" between them in the nursery days.\r\n\r\nSo, in the morning of Monday, October 17, her spirit passed quietly on\r\nto God's keeping.\r\n\r\nThose who were present at her funeral will not forget it. The\r\nflower-decked church, the mourning multitude, the white coffin borne\r\nhigh on the shoulders of eight stalwart grandsons, the words of age-long\r\nwisdom and beauty gathered into a parting tribute, the bugle sounding\r\nTaps, as she passed out in her last earthly triumph, the blind children\r\nsinging round the grave on which the autumn sun shone with a final\r\ngolden greeting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have told the story of our mother's life, possibly at too great\r\nlength; but she herself told it in eight words.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" Maud asked her once, \"what is the ideal aim of life?\"\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, and replied, dwelling thoughtfully on each word,--\r\n\r\n\"To learn, to teach, to serve, to enjoy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbott, J., I, 214, 215; II, 99.\r\n\r\n  Abdin Palace, II, 35, 36.\r\n\r\n  Abdul Hamid II, II, 42.\r\n\r\n  Abdul Hassan, mosque of, II, 36.\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, Countess of, II, 165, 166.\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, J.
