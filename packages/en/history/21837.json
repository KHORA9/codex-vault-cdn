PUTNAM'S SONS\r\n1889\r\n\r\nThe Knickerbocker Press\r\nElectrotyped and Printed by\r\nG. P. Putnam's Sons\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALL THOSE WHO LOVE TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND EQUITY, WHO\r\nVALUE OUR HERITAGE OF LIBERTY AND PEACEFUL FRATERNITY,\r\nAND WHO ARE WILLING TO UNITE IN UPHOLDING\r\nAND DEFENDING THE COMMONWEALTH--THAT\r\nPRESERVER AND PROTECTOR OF THE RIGHTS\r\nOF THE WHOLE PEOPLE--THE AUTHOR\r\nDEDICATES THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages it has been my endeavor to present, first, the\r\nresults of a careful and impartial investigation into the present and\r\nprospective status of the monopolies in every industry; and, second, to\r\ndiscuss in all fairness the questions in regard to these\r\nmonopolies--their cause, growth, future prospects, evils, and\r\nremedies--which every thinking man is to-day asking.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this task, the presentation of facts with regard to\r\nexisting monopolies, may seem to the well informed reader to be\r\nimperfectly done, because of the host of powerful and important\r\nmonopolies of every sort that are not so much as mentioned. But I have\r\ndeemed it most important that the broad facts concerning monopolies\r\nshould be widely known; and I have, therefore, aimed to present these\r\nfacts in a readable and concise way, although, in so doing, only a few\r\nof the important monopolies in each industry could be even mentioned. It\r\nis to be hoped that no one will underrate the importance of the problem\r\nof monopoly, or question the conclusions which I have reached, because\r\nof these omissions. To any such readers who may not be satisfied from\r\nthe facts hereafter given that monopolies are the salient feature of our\r\npresent industrial situation, and, moreover, that they have come to\r\nstay, I would recommend a careful perusal of the financial and trade\r\njournals for a few months.\r\n\r\nWherever possible I have presented actual statistics bearing on the\r\nquestion at issue; but as regards trusts, monopolies in trade, mining,\r\nlabor, and in fact nearly all monopolies, there are no statistics to be\r\nhad. Nor can any be obtained, for it would be absurd for the government\r\nto collect statistics of the operation of that which it pronounces\r\nillegal but makes no effort to punish.\r\n\r\nIt may increase the respect of some readers for the conclusions I have\r\nreached, to know that it was a practical acquaintance with monopolies\r\nrather than any study of economic theories which led me to undertake the\r\npresent work; that, at the time I undertook it, I was wholly undecided\r\nas to the proper remedies for monopolies, and was quite willing to\r\nbelieve, if the facts had proved it to me, that they were destined to\r\nwork their own cure; and that the rapid growth and increase of\r\nmonopolies in very many industries, in the few months since these\r\nchapters were written, have furnished fresh evidence that my conclusions\r\nhave not been amiss.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish to place all emphasis on the fact that all the great\r\nmovements toward genuine reform must go hand in hand. The cause of the\r\npeople is one cause, and those who work for honest officers in our\r\ngovernment, pure elections, the suppression of crime and pauperism, the\r\nmental and moral elevation of men and women, are striking harder blows\r\nat monopolies than they may realize. But if they desire to hasten the\r\nday of their success, they must bring the great masses of the people to\r\ncomprehend that these movements aim at nothing less than their complete\r\ndeliverance; and that the reformers who labor so earnestly to make our\r\ngovernment purer and its people nobler, heartily desire also to cure the\r\nevils of monopoly, and to serve the cause of the people in its every\r\nform.\r\n\r\nCHARLES WHITING BAKER.\r\n\r\nTRIBUNE BUILDING, New York City.\r\nJune, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

It is one of\r\nthe strange occurrences by which languages become indelible records of\r\ngreat facts in the history of the world, that this word has recently\r\nacquired a new meaning, which, to the popular ear at least, is as\r\nhateful as the old meaning is pleasant and gratifying.\r\n\r\nSome future generation may yet be interested in searching out the fact\r\nthat back in the nineteenth century the word \"trust\" was used to signify\r\nan obnoxious combination to restrict competition among those engaged in\r\nthe same business; and that it was so called because the various members\r\nof the combination entrusted the control of their projects and business\r\nto some of their number selected as trustees. We of the present day,\r\nhowever, are vitally interested in a question far more important to us\r\nthan the examination of a curiosity of philology. We are all of us\r\ndirectly affected to-day by the operation of trusts; in some cases so\r\nthat we feel the effect and rebel under it; in other cases, so that we\r\nare unconscious of their influence and pay little heed to their working.\r\n\r\nIt is but a few months since public attention was directed to the\r\nsubject of trusts; but, thanks to the widespread educational influence\r\nof the political campaign, at the present day the great proportion of\r\nthe voters of the country have at least heard of the existence of\r\ntrusts, and have probably some idea of their working and their effect\r\nupon the public at large. They have been pointed out as a great and\r\ngrowing evil; and few speakers or writers have ventured to defend them\r\nfarther than to claim that their evil effects were exaggerated, and\r\npredict their early disappearance through natural causes; but while\r\nremedy after remedy has been suggested for the evil so generally\r\nacknowledged, none seems to have met with widespread and hearty\r\napproval, and practically the only effect thus far of the popular\r\nagitation has been to warn the trust makers and trust owners that the\r\npublic is awakening to the results of their work and is likely to call\r\nthem to account.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, as we shall see later, that it is a difficult matter to\r\napply an effective remedy of any sort to the trusts by legislation,\r\nwithout running counter to many established precedents of law and\r\ncustom, and without serious interference with what are generally\r\nregarded as inalienable rights. Yet we are making the attempt. Already\r\nlegislative and congressional committees have made their tours of\r\ninvestigation, and bills have been introduced in the legislatures of\r\nmany of the States, and in Congress, looking to the restriction or\r\nabolition of trust monopolies.\r\n\r\nIt is the wise surgeon, however, who, before he takes the knife to cut\r\nout a troublesome growth, carefully diagnoses its origin and cause,\r\ndetermines whether it is purely local, or whether it springs from the\r\ngeneral state of the whole body, and whether it is the herald of an\r\norganic disease or merely the result of repressed energies or\r\nwrongly-trained organs. So we, in our treatment of the body politic,\r\nwill do well to examine most carefully the actual nature of the diseases\r\nwhich we seek to cure, and discern, if we can, the causes which have\r\nbrought them on and tend to perpetuate them. If we can discover these,\r\nwe shall, perhaps, be able to cure permanently by removing the ultimate\r\ncause. At any rate, our remedies will be apt to reach the disease far\r\nmore effectually than if they were sought out in a haphazard way.\r\n\r\nThe crudest thinker, at the first attempt to increase his knowledge of\r\nthe general nature of trusts, discovers that the problem has a close\r\nconnection with others which have long puzzled workers for the public\r\ngood. Trusts ally themselves at once in his mind with monopolies, in\r\nwhichever form he is most familiar with them, and are apt to be classed\r\nat once, without further consideration, as simply a new device for the\r\noppression of the laborer by the capitalist. But the man of judicious\r\nand candid mind is not content with any such conclusion; he finds at\r\nonce, indeed, that a trust is a combination to suppress competition\r\namong producers of manufactured goods, and he calls to mind the fact\r\nthat other combinations to suppress competition exist in various other\r\nlines of industry. Surely when the governing motives are so similar, the\r\nproper remedies, if remedies are needed, cannot be greatly unlike. And\r\nthough, taking the country as a whole, trusts have occupied more\r\nattention lately than any other form of monopoly, the problem of\r\nrailroad monopoly is still all-absorbing in the West; in every city\r\nthere is clamor against the burdens of taxation levied by gas,\r\nelectric-light, street-railway, and kindred monopolies; while strikes in\r\nevery industry testify to the strength of those who would shut out\r\ncompetition from the labor market. These and similar social and\r\nindustrial problems are quite as important as the problem of trusts, and\r\ntheir solution is becoming every day more urgent and necessary. If we\r\nneglect them too long, or carelessly adopt some unsuitable or unjust\r\nremedy, who knows the price we may pay for our folly in blood and\r\ntreasure?\r\n\r\nThe problem before us, then, as we see it from our present standpoint,\r\nis the problem of monopoly. What is it? Whence comes it? What are its\r\neffects? And, most important of all, what ought we to do about it?\r\nSurely questions whose correct answer is of such importance to the\r\nwelfare of each person and to the very existence of society demand the\r\ncareful consideration of every thinking man.\r\n\r\nLet us then take up this problem and give it the fairest and most candid\r\ninvestigation possible. In order to do this, let us remember that _the\r\ntruth_ is the object of our search, and that it will be necessary, if\r\nthe conclusions from our investigation are to be of value, that we\r\ndivest ourselves, so far as possible, of all preconceived opinions\r\nfounded, perhaps unconsciously, on the statements or evidence of\r\nincompetent authorities, and also of all prejudices. Let us, in\r\nsearching for facts and principles, examine with impartiality the\r\nevidence and arguments which each side presents, and judge with candor\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThe author wishes to make an earnest personal request to the reader who\r\nis minded to follow the discussion through the following pages, that he\r\nwill in good faith attempt to do this thing: that he will lay aside for\r\nthe present his opinions already formed, as the author himself has\r\nconscientiously aimed to do while pursuing this investigation, and give\r\na fair hearing to both sides of the question. A complicated machine can\r\nonly be understood when it is viewed from different standpoints. So,\r\nhere, in order to find the truth, we must examine trusts from the\r\nstandpoint of the trust maker as well as from that of the consumer; and\r\ntrade unions, from the standpoint of their members as well as from the\r\nground of employers and of the public at large. We shall indeed meet\r\nmuch error by this method of study, but is it not proverbial that there\r\nare two sides to every question? It will be our task to study these\r\nopposing views and sift from them the truths for which we seek.\r\n\r\nIn taking up now the problem before us, let us adopt the true scientific\r\nmethod for its solution. We must first find out as fully as possible the\r\nactual facts with regard to monopolies of every sort and the competition\r\nwhich monopoly replaces. Next, by discussing and comparing the evidence\r\nobtained, we may be able to discover the natural laws by which\r\ncompetition and monopoly are controlled; and finally, with our knowledge\r\nof these, we will try to discover both the source of the evils which vex\r\nus and the proper methods for ameliorating, curing, or preventing them,\r\nwhichever may be found possible.\r\n\r\nSuch is the outline of the investigation before us, which it may as well\r\nbe said here could easily be extended and amplified to fill many\r\nvolumes. The author has preferred to prepare the present volume without\r\nsuch amplification, believing that the busy men of affairs, to whom a\r\npractical knowledge of the subjects herein treated is most essential,\r\nhave, as a rule, no leisure for the extended study which the volumes\r\ninto which the present one might easily be expanded would require. He\r\ntrusts, however, that brevity will not be found wholly incompatible with\r\nthoroughness; and that the fact that much which might have properly been\r\nincluded in the book is omitted, will not be taken as a necessary\r\nindication that the conclusions arrived at are without value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn common use the word \"trust\" is at present rather loosely used to\r\ndenote any combination formed for the purpose of restricting or killing\r\ncompetition. Properly speaking, however, a trust is a combination to\r\nrestrain competition among producers, formed by placing the various\r\nproducing properties (mills, factories, etc.) in the hands of a board of\r\ntrustees, who are empowered to direct the operations of production and\r\nsale, as if the properties were all under a single ownership and\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe novel characteristic of the trust is not the fact that it is a\r\nmonopoly, but that it is a monopoly formed by combining several\r\ncompetitors according to a new plan. The process of placing property in\r\nthe hands of trustees is familiar to every business man. In the\r\nformation of a trust the different firms or companies who have been\r\ncompeting with each other in the production and sale of goods agree to\r\nplace the management of all their several properties in the hands of a\r\nboard of trustees. The powers of this board and its relation to the\r\nowners of the various properties are ingeniously devised to evade the\r\ncommon law, which declares that contracts in restraint of competition\r\nare against public policy, and illegal.\r\n\r\nThe first of the modern trusts was the Standard Oil Trust, which was a\r\ncombination formed among several of the refiners of crude petroleum in\r\nthe States of Pennsylvania and Ohio in the year 1869. The original\r\ncombination grew out of the control of certain important patents\r\nconnected with the process of refining. It pursued its course for a\r\nnumber of years without attracting much attention outside of the centre\r\nof its operations; but of late years so much has been published in\r\nregard to it that the very word \"Standard\" has come to be almost a\r\nsynonym for monopoly. It is probable that certain branches of the iron\r\nand steel trade were the next to be combined by means of a trust, but as\r\nthese were arrangements between private firms, not much information as\r\nto the time of their origin has reached the public. The second great\r\ntrust to attract general public attention was the American Cotton Oil\r\nTrust, in which some of the same men who have so successfully engineered\r\nthe Standard Oil combination are heavily interested. These two great\r\ntrusts, the Cotton Oil and the Standard, have attracted widespread\r\nattention, and, to a certain extent, the public has become familiar with\r\ntheir organization and plan of operation; but popular feeling on the\r\nsubject was not fully aroused until 1887, when the newspapers of the\r\ncountry made generally known the fact that the trust principle of\r\ncombination was being rapidly adopted by the manufacturers of a large\r\nnumber of important lines of goods. The effect which these monopolies\r\nwere believed to have upon the public welfare was pointed out by writers\r\nand speakers, and Congress and the State Legislatures were besought to\r\ninvestigate these combinations and seek to suppress them. Meanwhile it\r\nseems to be true that the popular agitation has had no effect in\r\nlessening the number of trusts, or checking their formation and growth;\r\nand they continue to increase and to gather their profits, while the\r\npublic impotently wonders what it is going to do about it. Let us be\r\ncareful, however, to make no assumption that the trust is injurious to\r\nthe public at large. That is a matter which is before us for\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to assume that the reader is somewhat familiar with the\r\ngeneral charges which have been brought against the trusts; but even if\r\nthis side of the story has not been heard, it is not unfair to look at\r\nthem first from the standpoint of the men who make and manage them. In\r\norder to do this, suppose we select some particular trust which will\r\nserve as a type, and imagine that some frank, candid manufacturer, who\r\nis a member of this trust, comes before us to give an account of its\r\nformation and operations. This man comes, we suppose, not as an\r\nunwilling informant, or as one on trial. He is frank, honest, and\r\nplain-spoken. He talks as man to man, and gives us, not the specious\r\nargument of an eloquent pleader in defence of trusts, but just that view\r\nof his trust and its work that his own conscience impels him to take.\r\nCertainly, then, he deserves an impartial hearing.\r\n\r\n     A number of years ago the principal manufacturers of linseed oil in\r\n     the United States formed an association. It was started largely for\r\n     social ends, and was very successful. Business men are generally\r\n     most interested in their own plans and operations; and those who\r\n     are familiar with the same topics and have similar interests and\r\n     purposes are apt to make agreeable companions for each other. We\r\n     discussed many points connected with the management of our business\r\n     at the meetings, and by interchanging with each other our views\r\n     and experiences with different devices, methods of management,\r\n     etc., we were able to get much valuable information, as well as\r\n     social pleasure, from meeting one another.\r\n\r\n     Now within the past few years things have been going from bad to\r\n     worse with the manufacturers of linseed oil. The long and short of\r\n     it all was that the margin between the cost of the raw seed and\r\n     running our mills, and what we could get for the oil cake and the\r\n     linseed oil in the market, has grown exceedingly narrow. It's hard\r\n     to tell just what has caused it. They say over-production; but what\r\n     has caused the over-production? One thing that may have had\r\n     something to do with it is the new mills they have been putting up\r\n     in the Northwest. Many of the Eastern mills used to get large\r\n     quantities of seed from Iowa; but they are building cities out\r\n     there now, as well as raising flax-seed, and when they were booming\r\n     some of those cities they would raise heavy bonuses in aid of new\r\n     enterprises. Among these were some great linseed oil mills, which\r\n     have loaded up the market pretty heavily of late years; so that not\r\n     only has the price sagged down, but we have all had to work to get\r\n     rid of our stocks. The firms which had the best mills and\r\n     machinery, and were in a position to get their seed reasonably and\r\n     put their goods on the market with least expense for\r\n     transportation, etc., have been making a small profit over and\r\n     above their expenses. But some of the works which had to bring\r\n     their seed a long way, and which haven't quite as good machinery as\r\n     can be had now, were in a bad way. There were some of the oldest\r\n     houses in the trade among them, too, and with fine men at their\r\n     head. It was too bad to have them go under. They tried to cut down\r\n     expenses, but strikes and trouble with their men prevented their\r\n     saving much in that way. Then there was one item of expense which\r\n     they had to increase instead of cutting down: that was the cost of\r\n     marketing. Competition was so fierce, that, in order to keep up\r\n     their trade, they had to spend more on salaries of expensive\r\n     salesmen, and in advertising and pushing their goods, than they\r\n     would dream of ordinarily.\r\n\r\n     It seemed too bad to cut each other's throats in that way, for that\r\n     was what it amounted to, and when the association met,--or what was\r\n     left of it, for the business rivalries had grown so bitter that\r\n     many of the former personal friendships between the members had\r\n     become strained and one after the other had dropped out,--the\r\n     situation was discussed by the few members who met together. It\r\n     was discussed earnestly, too, by men who felt an interest in what\r\n     they said, because unless some remedy could be devised, they had\r\n     got to sit still and watch the savings of a lifetime slip through\r\n     their fingers. One thing was very clear to all. Though competition\r\n     was as sharp as any one could possibly wish, the public was not\r\n     getting such a wonderful benefit after all. Prices were not so very\r\n     much lower for oil, nor higher for seed. It was the selling expense\r\n     which had run up to a ruinous figure; and on one point all the\r\n     members were unanimous,--that if all the firms in the trade could\r\n     only work together in harmony in marketing their goods, they could\r\n     save enough in salesmen's salaries, etc., to make a great\r\n     difference in the profit-and-loss account without affecting the\r\n     selling prices in the market one penny.\r\n\r\n     Another very important matter, which we had to handle pretty\r\n     tenderly in our discussions, was that of adulteration. I must\r\n     confess that a good many firms in the trade, who used to be above\r\n     any thing of the sort, have been marketing some goods in the past\r\n     few years which were not exactly the \"pure linseed oil\" which they\r\n     were labelled. It's a mean business--adulteration,--but not many of\r\n     our customers ever test their purchases. The one thing they are apt\r\n     to look at is price, for they are buying to sell again; and when\r\n     rivals are selling a cheaper oil that seems just as good until it\r\n     is laid on as the pure linseed that you are obliged to ask a higher\r\n     price for, the temptation to meet them at their own game, rather\r\n     than lose your old customers, is a very strong one. Certainly, when\r\n     competition took this form, it hurt the public even more than it\r\n     hurt us. When people wish to buy pure linseed oil they ought to\r\n     have some prospect of getting it, instead of getting an adulterated\r\n     mixture of various substances; but at the rate competition was\r\n     running, there seemed to be small prospect that there would be any\r\n     really pure linseed oil put on the market in a short time. We have\r\n     often discussed the possibility of stopping these adulterations,\r\n     but it was a hard matter to cure by mere mutual agreement. How do I\r\n     know what my competitor in a city a hundred miles away, does with\r\n     the vats in his cellar after working hours, even if he has solemnly\r\n     agreed not to adulterate his goods? For I must confess that there\r\n     are a few men in our trade who are as tricky as horse jockeys.\r\n\r\n     Quite a number of improvements have been patented in linseed oil\r\n     machinery in the past twenty years. Nothing wonderful, but things\r\n     that effect little economies in the manufacture. We could have done\r\n     without them; but when a few firms took them up, of course the rest\r\n     had to follow suit, or fall behind in the race of competition. We\r\n     have had to pay a heavy royalty on some of these machines, and it\r\n     has been rather galling to count out our hard-earned dollars to the\r\n     company which has bought up most of the patents, and is making 100\r\n     per cent. a year on what it paid for them, with no risk, and\r\n     without doing a stroke of work. Now if we manufacturers could work\r\n     in harmony, we could make this company come down from their high\r\n     horse, and they would have to ask a reasonable price for their\r\n     machines. But we could do more than this. It stands to reason that\r\n     a good many improvements will be made in our machinery in the\r\n     future. We don't object to paying a fair price to any inventor who\r\n     will work out these new ideas for us; but it does seem unjust for\r\n     him to go and sell them to some outside company for a song, and\r\n     have that company bleed the users of the improvement for every\r\n     ounce they will stand. Now, by working together, we can refuse to\r\n     pay royalties on any thing new which comes up; but require,\r\n     instead, that any new patent in our line be submitted to a\r\n     committee, who will examine and test it; and if they find it to be\r\n     of value, will purchase it for the use of all members of the\r\n     association.\r\n\r\n     Some of the members thought this was as far as we ought to go. They\r\n     were opposed to \"trusts\" on principle. But the great majority saw\r\n     so clearly where we could continue to better ourselves that they\r\n     became enthusiastic over it.\r\n\r\n     Some speculators, in years of short crops, have occasionally tried\r\n     to \"corner\" flax-seed in a small way. We could refuse to buy except\r\n     directly from the growers, and that branch of speculation would be\r\n     a thing of the past. We have sent out some pretty sharp men as\r\n     buyers, and sometimes they have bought flax-seed in some of the\r\n     backwoods districts at very low rates. At other times, two buyers\r\n     from rival firms have run counter to each other, and paid prices\r\n     larger than their employers could really afford. But with our\r\n     combination, we cannot only fix uniform prices for seed, but we can\r\n     send out only enough buyers to cover the territory; and the work of\r\n     buying is reduced to simply inspecting and weighing the seed.\r\n\r\n     Now another thing: Of course, not every manufacturer in the\r\n     business owns his mills. It is a fact that since the close times of\r\n     the past few years the majority of the firms are carrying mortgages\r\n     on their mills; and some of them in the West are paying as high as\r\n     eight or ten per cent. interest. But with the combined capital of\r\n     all the firms in the trade at our back, we can change all that.\r\n     Either by a guaranty, or by assuming the obligations, we can bring\r\n     the interest charges on every mill in the association down to four\r\n     or five per cent. at most.\r\n\r\n     We have been paying enormous rates to fire insurance companies.\r\n     They are not as familiar with our business as we are ourselves, and\r\n     they don't know just how much risk there really is; so they charge\r\n     us a rate which they make sure is high enough. We can combine\r\n     together and insure ourselves on the mutual plan; and by\r\n     stipulating that each firm shall establish and keep up such\r\n     precautions against fire as an expert may direct, we can not only\r\n     reduce the cost of our insurance to that of our actual losses, but\r\n     we can make these a very small amount.\r\n\r\n     It may be said that we might have done all these things without\r\n     forming any trust to control prices. But the practical fact was\r\n     that we could not. There was so much \"bad blood\" between some of\r\n     the different firms in the business, from the rivalry and the sharp\r\n     competition for trade, that as long as that was kept up it was\r\n     impossible to get them to have any thing to do with each other in a\r\n     business way. It was no small task to get these old feuds patched\r\n     up; but some of the best and squarest men in the business went\r\n     right into the work, and at meetings of the association, and\r\n     privately, exerted all their influence to forward this coming\r\n     together for mutual aid and protection. They did it\r\n     conscientiously, too, I think, believing that it was necessary to\r\n     save many of us from financial ruin; and that we were not bound,\r\n     under any circumstances, to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of the\r\n     public. The trust has been formed, as every one knows, and many of\r\n     the things we planned to do have been already accomplished. We have\r\n     stopped adulterations on all goods made by members of the trust;\r\n     and the improvement in the quality of linseed oil which has been\r\n     effected is an important benefit to the public. We are managing all\r\n     the works in the trust as if it were all a single property,\r\n     controlled by different managers; and the saving in expense, over\r\n     the old plan of cut-throat competition, when everybody was striving\r\n     to save himself and sink his rivals, is an enormous one.\r\n\r\n     One thing which has caused much hue and cry, is the fact that we\r\n     have closed half a dozen mills or so. But the matter stood in this\r\n     way: these mills were not favorably situated for doing business,\r\n     all things considered; and all the mills in the country cannot run\r\n     all the time, because there are more mills in existence than are\r\n     needed to supply the market. These mills must have been closed\r\n     soon, if the trust had not commenced operations, because they could\r\n     not be run under the old regime and pay expenses. We knew we could\r\n     make the oil at a less cost in our other mills, so we concluded to\r\n     buy out the owners of these at a fair price, and shut up the works.\r\n     Prices of linseed oil have been raised somewhat, we confess; but we\r\n     claim that they had been forced down much too low, by the excessive\r\n     competition which has prevailed for a few years past. Of course\r\n     some of the most hot-headed and grasping among us, were anxious to\r\n     force prices away up, when they once realized that we had an\r\n     absolute monopoly of the linseed oil trade of the country; but the\r\n     great majority were practically unanimous in a demand for just\r\n     prices only, and the adoption of the policy of live and let live;\r\n     for trust-makers are not entirely selfish.\r\n\r\n     We claim, moreover, that we are breaking no legal or moral law by\r\n     this action. We are, for the most part, private parties or\r\n     firms--but few corporations,--hence the attempt to abolish trusts\r\n     on the ground that the corporations composing trusts have exceeded\r\n     the power given by their charters will fail to reach our case. We\r\n     have certainly done this: we have killed competition in the linseed\r\n     oil trade; but we submit that with so many other interests and\r\n     trades organized to protect themselves from outside competition,\r\n     and control the prices at which their products are sold to the\r\n     public, we were, in self-defence and for our own preservation,\r\n     obliged to take this step.[1]\r\n\r\n       [1] It should be explained that the above is not given as a\r\n       _bona-fide_ statement of facts concerning this especial trust,\r\n       but as a vivid description of the organization and plans of a\r\n       typical trust, from the standpoint of its owners and managers.\r\n\r\n       Probably, too, few or no existing trusts have tried to benefit\r\n       themselves in so many different ways as we have supposed this\r\n       imaginary trust to have done. But to shorten our investigation,\r\n       the author has purposely extended the scope of this trust's\r\n       action, to bring out clearly the variety and importance of the\r\n       methods by which a trust reaps profits, aside from any advance in\r\n       the price of its product.\r\n\r\nIf we omit the references to the especial trade, the above view of a\r\ntrust from the trust-makers' standpoint will do for almost any of the\r\nmany combinations which have been formed by different manufacturers for\r\nthe purpose of controlling production and prices. One thing is clearly\r\nindicated in the above, and will certainly be conceded: That the men who\r\nhave formed these trusts are animated by the same motives as those that\r\ngovern humanity in general. They have, in some cases at least, known\r\nwhat it was to be crowded close to the wall by severe competition. They\r\nall at once saw a way opening by which they could be freed from the\r\nworries and losses which had been making their business one of small and\r\nuncertain profits, and would be set squarely on their feet with a sure\r\nprospect for large and steady gains. It is using a common expression to\r\nsay that they would have been more than human if they had refused to\r\nimprove this opportunity. Certainly, then, in examining further the\r\ntrusts, we shall do so with no feeling of personal prejudice toward the\r\nmen who originated them and carry them on.\r\n\r\nAs we have given a hearing to the case from the trust-makers'\r\nstandpoint, it is only fair that we should hear at equal length from the\r\npublic who oppose the trusts; but to abbreviate the investigation, let\r\nus suppose that we are already familiar with the various charges which\r\nare brought against the trust monopolies, and let us proceed at once to\r\nconsider the actual effect of the trusts upon the public.\r\n\r\nSince we have heard so much in defence of the linseed oil trust, it will\r\nbe well for us to inquire concerning the results, in which the public is\r\ninterested, which have followed its organization. During the year 1887\r\n(the trust was formed in January of that year) the price per gallon of\r\nlinseed oil rose from thirty-eight cents to fifty-two cents; and this\r\nprice was kept up or exceeded during 1888. That is to say, every\r\npurchaser of linseed oil, or every one who had occasion to have\r\npainting done, pays to the members of this trust, for every gallon of\r\noil that he uses, about fourteen cents _over and above_ the sum which he\r\nwould pay if competition were allowed to do its usual work in keeping\r\ndown prices.\r\n\r\nWhat profits are the members of this trust making? Let us suppose that\r\nthey were just able, at the old price of thirty-eight cents per gallon,\r\nto pay all their running expenses and four per cent. on the capital\r\ninvested, making nothing for profits beyond a fair salary to the\r\nmanagers of the business. Then the gain of fifteen cents a gallon in the\r\nselling price is _clear profit_ to them. Now add to this the fact, which\r\nwas plainly brought out in the foregoing supposed statement by a member\r\nof the trust, that it is possible by means of the trust to greatly\r\nreduce expenses in many directions as well as to increase receipts, and\r\nwe begin to form some conception of the profits which this trust is\r\nharvesting. If we wish to put the statement in figures, suppose we take\r\nthe annual consumption of linseed oil in the country at thirty million\r\ngallons. Then the profits of the trust from the increased prices alone\r\nwill amount to four and one half million dollars per annum.\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which trusts directly affect the public, which\r\nhas received very much less attention than it deserves. Besides the\r\npeople who use the linseed oil and pay the trust an extra fourteen cents\r\na gallon for the privilege, there are a great number of people who would\r\nhave used oil if the price had not advanced, but who cannot afford to do\r\nso at the advanced price. It is a well-known fact that every increase in\r\nthe price of any article decreases the demand, and the advance in the\r\nprice of linseed oil has undoubtedly had a great effect in decreasing\r\nthe consumption of oil. So while it is undoubtedly true that _at the\r\ntrust's prices_ there are more linseed-oil mills in the country than are\r\nneeded to supply its wants, yet if the prices were lowered to the point\r\nwhich free competition would fix, there would probably be demand enough\r\nto keep all the mills running. To the trust, then, must be ascribed the\r\nfinal responsibility for the stoppage of the mills and the loss of\r\nemployment by the workmen. Nor does the effect upon the labor market\r\nstop there. From the fact that less people can afford to paint their\r\nhouses, because of the higher price of the oil, it is certain that there\r\nwill be less employment for painters; and as less paint is used, all\r\nthose interested in and employed in the paint trade are sufferers. It is\r\nto be remembered that we are speaking of the linseed oil trust only to\r\nmake the case more vivid. The principle is general and applies equally\r\nwell to other trusts, as for instance to the loss of employment by\r\nthousands of men working in refineries controlled by the sugar trust, in\r\nthe fall of 1888. Still another effect of this trust's action is to be\r\nespecially noted: the fact that the diminished production of oil lessens\r\nthe demand for seed; and also that in the purchase of seed, as well as\r\nin the sale of oil, the trust has killed competition. The trust may, if\r\nit chooses, fix uniform prices for the seed which it purchases; and the\r\nfarmer can take the prices they offer or keep his seed. Fortunately the\r\nfarmer can raise other products instead of flax-seed, and will do so if\r\nthe price is lowered by any large amount.\r\n\r\nOne other possible mode of profit for the trusts, which, however, they\r\nare hardly likely to engage in--from their fear of public opinion, if\r\nfor no other reason--lies in the power which they possess over the labor\r\nmarket. It will probably be conceded at once that the rate of wages in\r\nany occupation depends, among other things, upon the competition of the\r\nvarious workmen who seek employment in that occupation, and also upon\r\nthe competition among those who wish to hire men to work at that\r\noccupation. It is plain that when the competition among employers to\r\nsecure men is active, wages will rise; and when this competition falls\r\noff, wages will fall. Now the trust is more than a combination for\r\nselling purposes only. It is a combination of all the properties\r\nconcerned under practically a single ownership. Clearly, then, as the\r\nvarious mills belonging to a single owner will not compete with each\r\nother in the employment of labor, the mills belonging to a trust will be\r\nno more likely to do so. Thus if it were not for the fact that the\r\nworkmen are able to take up some other employment if their wages are too\r\nlow, they would be absolutely obliged to take what wages, great or\r\nsmall, the trust chose to give, and would be as dependent for their food\r\nand clothing upon the trust as was the slave upon his master.\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked why trusts have not been formed before, and\r\nwhat the causes are which have started them up so rapidly in such varied\r\nlines of industry. There is certainly room for much honest difference of\r\nopinion in reference to these causes; but one cause concerning whose\r\ninfluence there can be no dispute is the culmination of the change from\r\nthe ancient system of manufacturing to the modern. Let us briefly trace\r\nthe manner in which this branch of civilization has grown: In the most\r\nprimitive state of existence, each man procures and prepares for himself\r\nthe few things which he requires. With the first increase in\r\nintelligence those of most skill in making weapons and preparing skins\r\nmake more than they require for themselves, which they exchange with\r\nothers for the products of the chase. The next step is to teach to\r\nothers the special skill required, and to employ them to aid the chief\r\nworkman. Conditions analogous to these existed down to the end of the\r\nlast century. The great bulk of all manufacturing was done in small\r\nshops, each employing only a few workmen; and the manufacturer or master\r\nworkman labored at the side of his journeymen and apprentices. The\r\nproducts of these little workshops were sold in the country immediately\r\nadjacent. Of course the number of these scattered shops was so great\r\nthat the possibility of uniting all the manufacturers in any one trade\r\ninto a single organization to prevent competition among them, was beyond\r\nthe thoughts of the most visionary.\r\n\r\nThe present century has seen three great economic wonders accomplished:\r\nthe invention of labor-saving machinery, greatly multiplying the\r\nefficiency of labor in every art and trade; the application of steam\r\npower to the propulsion of that machinery; and the extension over all\r\ncivilized lands of a network of railway lines, furnishing a rapid, safe,\r\nand miraculously cheap means of transportation to every part of the\r\ncivilized world. In order to realize the greatest benefit from these\r\ndevices, it has become necessary to concentrate our manufacturing\r\noperations in enormous factories; to collect under one roof a thousand\r\nworkmen, increase their efficiency tenfold by the use of modern\r\nmachinery, and distribute the products of their labor to the markets of\r\nthe civilized world. The agency which has acted to bring about this\r\nresult is competition. The large workshops were able to make goods so\r\nmuch cheaper than the small workshops that the latter disappeared. Then\r\none by one the large workshops were built up into factories, or were\r\nshut up because the factories could make goods at less cost. So the\r\ngrowth has gone on, and each advance in carrying on production on a\r\nlarger scale has resulted in lessening the cost of the finished goods.\r\nCompetition, too, which at first was merely an unseen force among the\r\nscattered workshops, is now a fierce rivalry; each great firm strives\r\nfor the lion's share of the market. Under these conditions it is quite\r\nnatural that attempts should be made to check the reduction of profits\r\nby some form of agreement to limit competition. Many plans have been\r\ntried which attempted to effect this by mere agreements and contracts,\r\nmethods which left each property to the control of its special owners;\r\nbut none have been permanently successful. By the trust plan of\r\ncombination, the properties are practically consolidated; and the\r\nfailure of the combination through withdrawal of its members is avoided.\r\nIt offers to manufacturers, close crowded by competition, a means of\r\nswelling their profits and ensuring against loss; and encouraged by the\r\nphenomenal success of the Standard Oil combination, they have not been\r\nslow to accept it.\r\n\r\nThe point to which we need to pay especial attention, in the foregoing\r\nconsideration of the causes which have produced trusts, is the fact that\r\nthe cost of production is continually being cheapened as it is carried\r\non on a larger and larger scale. And because the cheaper mode of\r\nproduction must always displace the mode which is more expensive: as\r\nProf. Richard Ely expresses it, \"Production on the largest possible\r\nscale will be the only practical mode of production in the near future.\"\r\nWe need not stop to prove the statement that the cost of production by\r\nthe modern factory system is a small fraction of that by the old\r\nworkshop system. The fact that the former has beaten the latter in the\r\nrace of competition would prove it, if it were not evident to the most\r\ncareless observer. But it is also a fact that the trust, apart from its\r\ncharacter as a monopoly, is actually a means of cheapening production\r\nover the system by independent factories, for it carries it on on a\r\nlarger scale than it has ever before been conducted. Our review of the\r\ntrust from the trust makers' standpoint showed this most forcibly; and\r\nwe shall see more of it as we study further the methods by which the\r\nmonopoly gains an advantage over the independent producer in dispensing\r\nwith what we may call the waste of competition. In the argument\r\npresented by the Standard Oil Trust before the House Committee on\r\nManufactures in the summer of 1888, occurs the following statement of\r\nthe work which that monopoly has done in cheapening production:\r\n\r\n     \"The Standard Oil Trust offers to prove by various witnesses,\r\n     including Messrs. Flagler and Rockefeller, that the disastrous\r\n     condition of the refining business and the numerous failures of\r\n     refiners prior to 1875 arose from imperfect methods of refining,\r\n     want of co-operation among refiners, the prevalence of speculative\r\n     methods in the purchase and sale of both crude and refined\r\n     petroleum, sudden and great reductions in prices of crude, and\r\n     excessive rates of freight; that these disasters led to\r\n     co-operation and association among the refiners, and that such\r\n     association and co-operation, resulting eventually in the Standard\r\n     Oil Trust, has enabled the refiners so co-operating to reduce the\r\n     price of petroleum products and thus benefit the public to a very\r\n     marked degree and that this has been accomplished:\r\n\r\n     \"1. By cheapening transportation, both local and to the seaboard,\r\n     through perfecting and extending the pipe-line system, by\r\n     constructing and supplying cars with which oil can be shipped in\r\n     bulk at less cost than in packages, and the cost of packages also\r\n     be saved; by building tanks for the storage of oil in bulk; by\r\n     purchasing and perfecting terminal facilities for receiving,\r\n     handling, and reshipping oils; by purchasing or building steam tugs\r\n     and lighters for seaboard or river service, and by building\r\n     wharves, docks, and warehouses for home and foreign shipments.\r\n\r\n     \"2. That by uniting the knowledge, experience, and skill, and by\r\n     building manufactories on a more perfect and extensive scale, with\r\n     approved machinery and appliances, they have been enabled to and do\r\n     manufacture a better quality of illuminating oil at less cost, the\r\n     actual cost of manufacturing having been thereby reduced about 66\r\n     per cent.\r\n\r\n     \"3. That by the same methods, the cost of manufacture in barrels,\r\n     tin cans, and wooden cases has been reduced from 50 to 60 per cent.\r\n\r\n     \"4. That as a result of these savings in cost, the price of refined\r\n     oils has been reduced since co-operation began, about 9 cents per\r\n     gallon, after making allowance for reduction in the price of crude\r\n     oil, amounting to a saving to the public of about $100,000,000 per\r\n     annum.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly it would seem that this is a strong defence of the trust's\r\ncharacter as a public benefactor; but it is well to note that while it\r\nhas been making these expenditures and reducing the price of oil to the\r\nconsumer, it has also been making some money for itself. The profits of\r\nthis trust in 1887, according to the report of the committee appointed\r\nto investigate the subject of trusts by the New York Legislature, were\r\n$20,000,000. The nominal capital of the trust is but $90,000,000, a\r\nlarge portion of which is confessedly water. In answer to the statement\r\nthat the price of oil has been reduced steadily by the operations of the\r\ntrust, it is charged that no thanks is due to the trust for this\r\nbenefit. The trust has always wished to put up the price, but the\r\ncontinual increase in the production of the oil fields has obliged the\r\ntrust to make low prices in order to dispose of its stock. There are\r\nalso about one hundred independent refineries competing with the trust,\r\nand their competition may have had some influence in keeping prices\r\ndown. It is undoubtedly true that the economy in the storage,\r\ntransportation, and distribution of oil by the systematic methods of the\r\nStandard Oil Trust has made it possible to deliver oil to the consumer\r\nat a small fraction of its cost a decade ago. But it is also true that a\r\ngood part of the reduction in the price of oil is due to the abundant\r\nproduction of the petroleum wells, which have furnished us so lavish a\r\nsupply. The principal charges against this trust, made by those who were\r\nconversant with its operations, have never been that it was particularly\r\noppressive to consumers of oil; but that, in the attempt to crush out\r\nits competitors, it has not hesitated to use, in ways fair and foul, its\r\nenormous strength and influence to ruin those who dared to compete with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn a later chapter we shall be able to study these more intricate\r\nquestions regarding trusts with a better understanding of our problem.\r\nLet us pay some attention now to the growth of the trusts and of\r\ncombinations in general for the purpose of limiting competition among\r\nmanufacturers, which has taken place within the past few years.\r\n\r\nAccording to the little book entitled \"Trusts,\" by Mr. Wm. W. Cook, the\r\nproduction of the following articles was, in February, 1888, more or\r\nless completely in the hands of trusts: petroleum, cotton-seed oil and\r\ncake, sugar, oatmeal, pearl barley, coal, straw-board, castor oil,\r\nlinseed oil, lard, school slates, oil cloth, gas, whiskey, rubber,\r\nsteel, steel rails, steel and iron beams, nails, wrought-iron pipe, iron\r\nnuts, stoves, lead, copper, envelopes, paper bags, paving pitch,\r\ncordage, coke, reaping and binding and mowing machines, threshing\r\nmachines, ploughs, and glass--a long and somewhat jumbled list, to\r\nwhich, however, at the present time, there should probably be added:\r\nwhite lead, jute bagging, lumber, shingles, friction matches, beef,\r\nfelt, lead pencils, cartridges and cartridge-shells, watches and watch\r\ncases, clothes-wringers, carpets, coffins and undertakers' supplies,\r\ndental tools, lager beer, wall paper, sandstone, marble, milk, salt,\r\npatent leather, flour, and bread. It should be said that, as regards\r\nmost of these combinations, the public is ignorant beyond its knowledge\r\nthat some form of combination for the purpose of restricting competition\r\nhas been formed. For the purpose of our present investigation it makes\r\nlittle difference just what this combination may be.\r\n\r\nThe salient facts for us to note are, that among the manufacturers of\r\nthis country there has arisen a widespread movement to partially or\r\nwholly avoid competition in the production and sale of their goods; that\r\nin a very great number of manufacturing industries these combinations\r\nhave progressed so far that their managers have been able to advance\r\nprices and check production; that some of these combinations have taken\r\nthe form of trusts, and by this means have every prospect of maintaining\r\ntheir stability and reaping their enormous profits with the same\r\npermanency and safety as has their predecessor, the Standard Oil Trust;\r\nand, finally, that with this prospect before them, our manufacturers, as\r\na class, would lose their reputation as shrewd business men if they did\r\nnot follow out the path marked out for them, and combine every\r\nmanufacturing industry in which combination is possible upon the plan of\r\nthe trust.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be well to examine the statement attributed to Mr.\r\nAndrew Carnegie, that, \"there is no possibility of maintaining a trust.\r\nIf successful for a time, and undue profits accrue, competition is\r\ncourted which must be bought out; and this leads to fresh competition,\r\nand so on until the bubble bursts. I have never known an attempt to\r\ndefeat the law of competition to be permanently successful. The public\r\nmay regard trusts or combinations with serene confidence.\"\r\n\r\nSurely if this statement is true, we have little need for further\r\nexamination of this subject. We have now knowledge enough of our subject\r\nto enable us to determine its truth or falsity. We have found in the\r\nactual trusts that we have examined none which have shown signs of\r\nsuccumbing to outside competition. More than this, however, we have seen\r\nthat it is possible for a trust to carry on business and deliver goods\r\nto the consumer at much less cost than an independent manufacturer can.\r\nAnd as surely as this law holds that production on the largest scale is\r\nthe cheapest production, so surely will the trust triumph over the\r\nindependent manufacturer wherever they come into competition. If the\r\ntrust were always content when its competitors were disposed of, to make\r\nonly the profits which it could secure by selling at such prices as the\r\nindependent manufacturers could afford, there would be less outcry\r\nagainst it. But with the consumers wholly dependent upon it for\r\nsupplies, the prices are in the trust's hands; and the tendency is to\r\nreap not only the profits due to its lessened cost of production, but\r\nalso all it can secure by raising the selling price without arousing too\r\nmuch the enmity of the public.\r\n\r\nClearly the trust is at once a benefit and a curse. Can we by any means\r\nsecure the benefit which it gives of reduction in cost without placing\r\nourselves at the mercy of a monopoly? This is the question which must\r\noccur to every thoughtful man. Before we can answer it, however, we must\r\nexamine the effects of competition and monopoly in other industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLIES OF MINERAL WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a well known historical fact that the extraction of metals and\r\nminerals from the earth has been more subject to monopoly than almost\r\nany other business. It was, and in a large part of the civilized world\r\nstill is, esteemed a prerogative of the sovereign. Agricultural products\r\nhave always been gathered from a wide area; manufactures were formerly\r\nthe product of mean and scattered workshops; but in the working of a\r\nrich mine, there was a constant income more princely than was to be\r\nobtained from any other single source. Again, with all due respect to\r\nthe traditions of former generations, it seems to have been thought that\r\nany thing to which no one else had a valid title belonged to the crown;\r\nand as no one was able to assert any stronger claim to the ownership of\r\nmineral wealth than that they had stumbled upon it, it was natural for\r\nthe sovereign to claim it as his. We see thus the recognition at an\r\nearly date of the inherent difference between natural wealth and that\r\ncreated by labor.\r\n\r\nBut coming down to the present time, it is evident that the business of\r\nextracting some of the rarer metals from the earth is peculiarly liable\r\nto become a monopoly. It is one of the new laws of trade, whose force\r\nand importance we are just finding out, that the ease of restricting\r\ncompetition varies with the number of competing units which must be\r\ncombined. Our most valuable metal, iron, is so widely distributed that\r\nany attempt to control the whole available supply could not long be\r\nsuccessful. But it is one of the peculiarities of modern industry that\r\nby its specialization it furnishes constant opportunities for the\r\nestablishment of new forms of monopoly, whose power is not generally\r\nunderstood. In the manufacture of Bessemer steel, which has now largely\r\ndisplaced wrought iron in the arts, it is necessary to use an iron ore\r\nof peculiar chemical composition. This ore is found most abundantly and\r\nof best quality in the mines of the Vermilion range, lying about one\r\nhundred miles north of Duluth, Minn., and in the mines of the Marquette\r\nGogebic, and Menominee regions in the north Michigan peninsula.\r\nAccording to good authorities, a combination more or less effective has\r\nbeen formed among the owners of all these mines; and the highest price\r\nis charged for the ore which can be obtained without driving the\r\ncustomer to more distant markets for his supply. Among the mines of this\r\ndistrict, competition, if not entirely stopped, is greatly checked, and\r\nis likely soon to be entirely a thing of the past. It is an interesting\r\nfact that among the members of the syndicate which owns the principal\r\nmines in the Vermilion regions are some of the trustees of the Standard\r\nOil Trust. It is stated that some of these mines have paid 90 per cent.\r\nper annum on their capital stock, which, it is to be noted, represents a\r\nmuch greater sum than the amount invested in the plant of the mine.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that the mining of the raw ore from which iron is\r\nmade, abundant and scattered though it is, is not free from monopoly.\r\nThe combinations to restrict competition among the makers of cast iron\r\nand of steel belong properly under the head of monopolies in\r\nmanufactures. We need only refer here to the fact that they are supposed\r\nto exist and have more or less control of the market.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the stability of our system of currency and of finance,\r\nthe precious metals, through the small ratio which their current\r\nproduction bears to the world's stock, and the fact that this stock is\r\nscattered among an enormous number of holders, are safe from any\r\nattempts to establish a monopoly to control their price through the\r\ncontrol of their production. Other metals, however, which are like\r\nsilver and gold in being found in workable deposits at but a few points\r\non the globe but are there found in abundance, are peculiarly adapted to\r\nfacilitate the schemes of monopolists. Of lead, copper, zinc, and tin,\r\nwe require a steady supply for use in the various arts; and the\r\nstatement has been made that the supply of each one of these is in the\r\nhands of a trust. To see the effect which these combinations have had on\r\nprices, let us examine the prices which have prevailed for two years\r\npast on these four articles, as shown in the following table:\r\n\r\nTable of wholesale prices (cents per lb.) in New York City of copper,\r\nlead, tin, and zinc during 1886, 1887, and 1888:\r\n\r\n  +--------------+-------+------+-------+------+\r\n  |              |Copper | Lead | Tin   | Zinc |\r\n  |              +-------+------+-------+------+\r\n  | 1885 Dec. 31 | 11.50 | 4.60 |  -    | 5.35 |\r\n  | 1886 Apr. 3  | 11.45 | 4.90 |  -    | 5.50 |\r\n  | 1886 July 3  | 10.00 | 4.90 |  -    | 5.60 |\r\n  | 1886 Oct. 7  | 11.00 | 4.35 |  -    | 5.60 |\r\n  | 1887 Jan. 5  | 12.25 | 4.75 | 24.50 | 6.42 |\r\n  | 1887 Apr. 6  | 11.00 | 4.75 | 24.50 | 6.50 |\r\n  | 1887 July 6  | 10.50 | 4.92 | 25.00 | 7.00 |\r\n  | 1887 Oct. 6  | 11.00 | 4.45 | 23.30 | 6.75 |\r\n  | 1887 Dec. 29 | 17.75 | 5.00 | 37.00 | 6.00 |\r\n  | 1888 Mar. 29 | 17.50 | 5.50 | 39.50 | 6.75 |\r\n  | 1888 July 3  | 17.25 | 4.25 | 22.00 | 6.50 |\r\n  | 1888 Oct. 4  | 18.50 | 5.75 | 26.00 | 6.75 |\r\n  | 1889 Jan. 3  | 17.50 | 3.85 | 22.00 | 5.50 |\r\n  | 1889 Apr. 29 | 16.50 | 4.25 | 23.00 | 6.50 |\r\n  +--------------+-------+------+-------+------+\r\n\r\nTaking the evidence of this table, we conclude that the combination\r\nwhich is said to control the zinc and lead markets is probably not a\r\ntrust, but a \"Producer's syndicate\" or corner. The prices of lead show\r\nno such firm tendency to advance as would be expected if the production\r\nwas in the hands of a single combination.\r\n\r\nThe prices of zinc, however, show a decided advance in the past two\r\nyears over the prices for the three years preceding, the average price\r\nfor 1886 being but 5.50, while for 1887-8 it is 6.58. This is a rise of\r\nno small importance, and the way it is maintained seems to give evidence\r\nof restriction of competition among producers.\r\n\r\nBut the striking fact in the above table is the evidence it presents of\r\nthe work which has been done by that most gigantic and daring\r\ncombination for the suppression of competition ever organized, the\r\nFrench Copper Syndicate or _La Société Industrielle Commerciale des\r\nMetaux_. This syndicate of French capitalists began operations in 1887,\r\nwith the intention of \"cornering\" the tin supply of the world. The rise\r\nin price which was due to their operations is shown in the above table.\r\nBut before completing their scheme they relinquished it for a grander\r\nenterprise, which would embrace the copper production of the world. They\r\nmade contracts with the copper-mining companies in every country of the\r\nglobe, by which they agreed to purchase all the copper which should be\r\nproduced by the mines for three years to come at the fixed price of 13\r\ncents per pound, and a bonus of half the profit which the syndicate was\r\nable to make from its sales to consumers. In effect this move killed the\r\ncompetition in the copper trade of the world, and placed every consumer\r\nat the mercy of this Paris syndicate. The advance in tin was of short\r\nduration, and those who suffered by it were speculators rather than\r\nconsumers; but the advance in copper, as shown by our table, is still\r\nfirmly maintained, and its effect on the industries using copper has\r\nbeen seriously felt all through 1888. In October, 1888, the _Société_\r\nextended its contracts with several mining companies to cover a period\r\nof twelve years, and advanced its price to the producers to 13½ cents\r\nper pounds. At the same time, to avoid the accumulation of stock, which\r\nthe diminished consumption consequent upon the increased price had\r\ncaused, and which it had been generally predicted would finally be the\r\ncause of the _Société's_ downfall, they arranged for the restriction of\r\nthe production of the mines. If the _Société_, which is backed by the\r\nheaviest capital, and managed by the shrewdest business skill of France,\r\ndoes what it intends to do, and its tributary producers are faithful to\r\ntheir contracts, for ten years to come, yes, for all years to come--for\r\nit is not likely that an enterprise of such golden returns will ever be\r\nabandoned if it can once profitably be carried out,--the world must pay\r\nfor its copper whatever these monopolists demand.\r\n\r\nProbably the argument against the private ownership and control of the\r\nwealth which nature has stored up for the whole world's use was never\r\nbrought home to men's minds so forcibly as it has been by the acts of\r\nthese French speculators. Copper is a necessity to the industries of\r\ncivilized society; and the mind of every unprejudiced person protests\r\nagainst the injustice of placing in the hands of any single firm or\r\ncombination the power to exact such prices as they choose for the great\r\nstaples of human consumption. This increase of price of about 7 cents\r\nper pound is a tax which affects, directly or indirectly, every person\r\nin the civilized world. Let us inquire what becomes of this tax. Perhaps\r\n2 cents per pound will go into the pockets of the Frenchmen who have\r\nengineered the combination, a sum which will give them, if we set the\r\nannual consumption of copper at 400,000,000 pounds, a comfortable net\r\nincome of about $8,000,000 per annum. The lion's share of the profits is\r\ntaken by the producers, however; who, if 10 cents is the price at which\r\ncopper would sell if free competition were in force, are receiving under\r\nthe present contract with the _Société_ about 5 cents per pound as a\r\nreward for their co-operation in its monopolistic scheme.[2]\r\n\r\n     [2] Since the above was written the collapse of the copper\r\n     syndicate has taken place. The causes which brought this about were\r\n     the failure to complete the contracts for restriction of\r\n     production, and lack of funds to meet the current liabilities. The\r\n     reason for both these must be largely ascribed to the fact that it\r\n     had come to be generally realized how great and how obnoxious the\r\n     monopoly was; and capitalists rightly feared that government\r\n     interference would be interposed to check the monopoly's\r\n     operations. If the syndicate had made its long-time contracts at\r\n     the start, or if it had been bold and shrewd enough to have\r\n     inveigled speculators on the bear side of the market into operating\r\n     against it, M. Secretan and his associates might have won as many\r\n     millions as they could have wished. It is a significant fact that\r\n     the downfall of the syndicate was not followed by the\r\n     reëstablishment of free competition. Instead there was at once talk\r\n     of another syndicate being formed to hold the copper stored up by\r\n     the _Société_, and keep the price up as long as possible. On this\r\n     side of the water the question was at once canvassed whether a\r\n     combination could be formed among the different American companies\r\n     to prevent competition and support the price. Evidently the failure\r\n     of this scheme has not discouraged the makers of monopolies.\r\n\r\nIt is appropriate here, too, to make reference to the enormous profits\r\nwhich the owners of the copper mines of the country are receiving, apart\r\nfrom the special influence of this great syndicate. The richest and most\r\nvaluable copper mines in the world lie on the southern shore of Lake\r\nSuperior. The Calumet and Hecla Company, which works one of the richest\r\ndeposits of native copper ever found, has a capital stock of $2,500,000,\r\non which it has paid, since 1870, $30,000,000 in dividends. The reports\r\nof these companies to their stockholders show that the present cost of\r\nrefined copper at the mines is as low as 4 cents per pound, and its\r\ncost, delivered in the New York market, is only 5¾ cents. Probably the\r\nofficers of these companies are right in their belief that in no other\r\nmines of the world can copper be produced so cheaply. But the question\r\nthat comes with force to every thinking man is: If the wealth of the ore\r\nin these mines is so much greater than that in any other that it can be\r\nproduced at so much less cost, does there not exist here a natural\r\nmonopoly, of which the owners of these mines are getting the sole\r\nbenefit? And, again, by what right does the chief benefit from this rich\r\ndeposit accrue to the few men who own the mines, rather than to the many\r\nmen in all parts of the world who wish to use their product?\r\n\r\nGreat and important as is the copper monopoly, of far greater importance\r\nto us than any and all the combinations in the metal industries are the\r\nmonopolies which control the price of coal. We do not often realize how\r\nintimately connected is our nineteenth-century civilization with the\r\nstore of fuel laid up for us in distant geologic ages. And in this\r\ncountry, with our severe climate, coal is all-important as a factor of\r\ndomestic economy, as well as a necessity to manufacturing and\r\nmetallurgical industries. The total cost to the consumers of the coal\r\nused in the United States every year (about 120,000,000 tons), calling\r\nthe average retail price $4.00 per ton, is nearly $500,000,000, or over\r\n$8.00 per annum for every man, woman, and child in the country. Surely,\r\nthen, the statement which we make at the outset, that the coal trade of\r\nthe United States is in the hands of monopolists; and that competition,\r\nwhere not killed, is almost impotent to keep down prices, is one which\r\nmerits earnest attention.\r\n\r\nThe United States possesses coal fields of enormous extent and richness.\r\nThe mineral is widely distributed, too, productive mines being now in\r\noperation in 27 of the States and Territories. Anthracite coal, however,\r\nwhich is by far the best adapted to domestic use, only occurs in a\r\nlimited area in the State of Pennsylvania; but here the deposit is of\r\nphenomenal richness. The total area of the Pennsylvania anthracite field\r\nis about 300,000 acres. Of this area nearly 200,000 acres is owned by\r\nseven railway corporations. These companies, either directly or through\r\nsubsidiary companies controlled in the same interest, carry on mining\r\noperations, carry the coal to market, and sell it. The following\r\nfigures[3] exhibit the receipts of each of these companies from sales of\r\ncoal from their mines during the year 1887:\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------+-----------+------------+\r\n  |              COMPANY.                   |  TONS.    |  RECEIPTS. |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------+-----------+------------+\r\n  | Philadelphia and Reading R.

E. Saward), and\r\n    \"Poor's Manual of Railroads,\" and partially estimated.\r\n\r\nThus these seven corporations alone produced from their own mines,\r\ncarried to market, and sold, over 34,000,000 tons of coal during the\r\nyear, for which they received about $90,000,000. Of the magnitude of the\r\noperations carried on by these great corporations we now have some idea.\r\nLet us next inquire to what extent competition is allowed to act between\r\nthem to keep down prices.\r\n\r\nMany years ago these seven companies formed the famous anthracite-coal\r\npool. This was an agreement by which all the companies concerned agreed\r\nto maintain a uniform selling price for coal at all important\r\ndistributing points where two or more of the companies came into\r\ncompetition. Some of the prices which were fixed by the pool were\r\nextremely arbitrary. Cities in Pennsylvania within an hour's ride of the\r\ncoal fields had to pay nearly as high a price for coal as those 500\r\nmiles or more distant. Rates of transportation on coal mined by\r\nindividual operators were made such that the latter could not afford to\r\nsell below the prices fixed by the pool, even if they had been so\r\ndisposed. At the present time the situation has been modified by the\r\nlong and short-haul clause of the Interstate Commerce law, by which the\r\nrailroad is obliged to make its transportation rates somewhat\r\nproportionate to distance, and also by the passage of a law in the State\r\nof Pennsylvania, by which the acts of the anthracite-coal pool were\r\ndeclared illegal and punishable. Nominally, therefore, the pool is a\r\nthing of the past; but the practical fact is, that by secret or tacit\r\nagreement the various companies are not competing with each other any\r\nmore now than in the days of the pool, and at points like New York or\r\nBuffalo, where two or more roads meet, the same prices are quoted by\r\neach different company.\r\n\r\nNor are the charges against the pool comprehended in its autocratic\r\ndetermination of the price of coal. To make production correspond with\r\nprice, it was necessary at times to close collieries entirely, throwing\r\nthe miners out of employment. The individual operators, too, have no\r\nlove for the combination. Their profit depends more than any thing else\r\non the rate of transportation, and thus whether they shall make or lose\r\ndepends on the railroad companies. They claim that the railways base\r\ntheir rates for carrying coal upon the principle of \"charging what the\r\ntraffic will bear.\" This is a matter, however, which we can better\r\ndiscuss in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident beyond dispute that the production of anthracite coal\r\nin this country is an industry uncontrolled by competition. To sum up:\r\nthese seven great corporations own more than two thirds of the area in\r\nwhich workable anthracite coal is found: they mine and market directly\r\nthe great bulk of the total production; the individual operators are\r\ndependent on the railways for getting their coal to a market; and the\r\nprice at which they can afford to sell it depends on the railroad\r\nrates. Finally, consider that these seven companies work in harmony,\r\nboth as to traffic rates and prices for the sale of coal, and the\r\nconclusion is irresistible that competition in anthracite-coal\r\nproduction in the United States is practically dead.\r\n\r\nLet it be noted, for the benefit of those who may conceive that the\r\nabove statement is unfair to the railway companies, that no charge is\r\nhere made that the prices fixed by the companies for the coal are at the\r\npresent time extortionate or unjust. That is a separate matter; in\r\nwhich, doubtless, there would be plenty to affirm on the one hand that\r\nthe prices charged were no more than a just compensation, while their\r\nopponents would declare that the prices adopted by the pool favor some\r\npoints to the prejudice of others, and that the statement that they were\r\non the whole exorbitant was proven by the fact that the railway lines in\r\nthe coal regions, where honestly managed, have paid great dividends on\r\nthe actual capital invested.\r\n\r\nCompared with the production of Pennsylvania anthracite, the coal\r\nproduction of any other single section seems small. But it is only so by\r\ncomparison, for the Western coals, while inferior in quality, are\r\nabundant and easily mined, and must remain the staple for general\r\nconsumption throughout the region west of the Mississippi, as well as\r\nfor large sections further east.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the people of the Western and Northwestern plains are\r\nwholly dependent upon the railroads for their supplies of every\r\ndescription, except the raw products of the soil. The railways\r\nthemselves are great consumers of coal, and have bought up large tracts\r\nof coal lands and opened mines. In the desire to develop traffic and\r\nensure a supply of coal to the settlers on their lines--we will even say\r\nof cheap coal,--the railway companies have entered the coal trade\r\nthemselves, either directly or through subsidiary companies. Thus it\r\ncomes about that hundreds of thousands of people of the West and\r\nNorthwest must pay for coal, which is an absolute necessity of life\r\nduring several months of the year, whatever price the managers of a\r\nsingle railway corporation may demand. Let it be understood that no\r\ncharges are here made of injustice or extortion on the part of the\r\nrailway companies. It is only wished to bring out the fact that\r\ncompetition is here wholly absent. It is believed that, in some cases at\r\nleast, an honest attempt has been made to mine and sell the coal at\r\nmerely a fair profit. But in days to come it will not be so directly for\r\nthe interest of the railways to deal liberally with their patrons as at\r\npresent. Other men of less breadth and principle and more ready to grasp\r\nat a chance for enormous profits may control the company's affairs; and\r\nif that happens, the opportunity to take advantage of the absence of\r\ncompetition and raise the price of coal will be utilized.\r\n\r\nA brief review of the actual status of the coal production of the West\r\nand South will help us to a clear appreciation of the case. The Missouri\r\nPacific Railway Company, through subsidiary companies, extracted from\r\nits mines in Missouri and the Indian Territory, during 1887, 1,618,605\r\ntons of coal. Through its control of transportation rates, private\r\noperators have been compelled to sell coal at the company's prices in\r\nthe market. The company has recently purchased large tracts of coal\r\nlands in Colorado, on which it is opening mines. The Atchison, Topeka,\r\nand Santa Fé, the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy, the Denver and New\r\nOrleans, the Union Pacific, and the Denver and Rio Grande Railway\r\ncompanies are also heavily interested in the Colorado coal mines. The\r\nlast company has long held a bonanza in the monopoly of the coal mining\r\nand transportation for the Colorado silver-mining and smelting\r\ndistricts. Though the other companies, to which the Rock Island should\r\nprobably be added, come in as competitors, there can be no doubt that\r\ntheir active competition will be of short duration. The Wyoming coal\r\nfields are being worked by the Union Pacific and the Chicago and\r\nNorthwestern companies, while the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy and a\r\ncompany supposed to be closely connected with the Northern Pacific are\r\npreparing to take the field at an early date. On the Pacific coast the\r\ncoal trade has long been a monopoly in the hands of the Oregon Railway\r\nand Navigation Company, who have kept the prices in San Francisco just\r\nbelow the point at which it becomes profitable to import Australian\r\ncoal. Other railways are now preparing to reach the coal fields, but can\r\nwe doubt that the competition to which the coal consumers are looking\r\nwith eager anticipation will prove evanescent? Returning to the East, we\r\nfind the coal mines of northern Illinois all held by a single company,\r\nwhich has full control of the traffic; while the mines of southern\r\nIllinois, on which the St. Louis consumers depend, are united as the\r\nConsolidated Coal Company. This latter corporation has \"wrecked\" many of\r\nits mines for the purpose of limiting the supply and raising the price;\r\nand has bought many mines of competing companies and closed them for the\r\nsame purpose. The Attorney-General of Illinois has been requested to\r\nbring suit against this \"trust\" for the forfeiture of its charter.\r\n\r\nIn the Hocking Valley coal fields in Ohio, the Columbus, Hocking Valley\r\nand Toledo Railway Company owns 10,000 acres of coal lands, and mined,\r\nin 1887, 1,870,416 tons of coal. The coal in western Virginia is coming\r\ninto the hands of the Norfolk and Western Railroad Company, while the\r\ncoal of Alabama, of which so much has been noised abroad, has been\r\nquietly gathered in by the Louisville and Nashville corporation. The\r\nTennessee Coal and Iron Company, which owns 76,000 acres of coal lands,\r\nand mined 1,145,000 tons in 1882, is owned by parties largely interested\r\nin the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad system. West\r\nVirginia has probably the most valuable untouched coal deposits of any\r\nState in the Union, but these also are rapidly being gathered up by\r\nrailway corporations.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, in the words of one of the best informed authorities, the\r\ncoal business of the country is at the mercy of the railroads.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, however, that this is simply the result of natural\r\ncauses. Railway managers, in seeking to develop and place on a sound\r\nbasis the mineral properties which could furnish a heavy and profitable\r\ntraffic to their lines, have only done what they regarded as their duty\r\nto the owners of their roads. And that this policy has effected a rapid\r\ndevelopment of our resources is beyond question.\r\n\r\nThe combinations to restrict competition among bituminous coal producers\r\nhave been of a very different sort from those in force among the\r\nanthracite producers. The soft-coal fields are so widely scattered that\r\nit has never been possible to combine all the producers so as to control\r\nprices by a single authority. Local combinations, however, controlling\r\nall the fields of a single locality, have long been an important\r\nfeature of the trade, and have been able to control prices pretty\r\nabsolutely within their respective localities. The fact that the\r\nprincipal item in the cost of coal is transportation, enables a\r\ncombination covering all the producers of a certain field to raise\r\nprices very notably before competitors can afford to ship from other\r\ncoal-producing districts.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that our fuel is especially liable to be subjected to\r\nmonopoly, for, as we have already seen in the preceding chapter, the\r\ncontrol over the petroleum trade is held by the Standard Oil Trust. How\r\nmuch of the production of crude petroleum is in the hands of the trust\r\nit is hard to say. This much is certain, that there is a \"Petroleum\r\nProducers' Association,\" which has a compact enough organization to be\r\nable to make contracts with the Standard Oil Company regarding the\r\nlimitation of production. It is even stated that the Standard Oil Trust\r\nitself controls to a considerable extent the oil-producing territory;\r\nbut this is hardly probable.\r\n\r\nOur newest and most wonderful fuel, natural gas, has already come under\r\nthe control of a few great corporations, who own the wells and the pipes\r\nfor conveying and distributing it to the consumers. A striking instance\r\nof the arbitrary nature of prices when under a monopoly's control was\r\nshown at Pittsburgh a few months ago. As is well known, upon the\r\nintroduction of natural gas to that city a great number of the\r\nmanufactories, as well as the private houses, discarded coal, and at\r\nconsiderable expense fitted up boilers, furnaces, etc., to use the new\r\nfuel. After the use of the gas had become general and its value had come\r\nto be thoroughly understood, the company furnishing the supply advanced\r\nthe rates 100 per cent., without previous notice; and despite the\r\nremonstrance of indignant consumers, the advanced rate had to be paid or\r\nthe use of the gas discontinued, the latter alternative involving the\r\nloss of the money invested in piping, burners, etc.\r\n\r\nOf the minor products of mines and quarries, marble, sandstone, borax,\r\nsalt, and asphalt are all known to be more or less thoroughly under the\r\ncontrol of monopolies, which, though less important and powerful, show\r\nthe same tendency toward the destruction of competition.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the extent to which the monopoly of the mineral wealth of\r\nthe world has gone, we can scarcely doubt that if the movement is\r\nunchecked it will go much farther. In one sense the only absolute\r\nnecessaries of life are food and clothing. But to the civilization of\r\nto-day the metals and minerals are no less indispensable; and these\r\ncannot be made anywhere, like manufactured goods; or grown on wide\r\nareas, like the products of the soil. We are absolutely at the mercy of\r\nthe men who own our deposits of coal and copper and lead, and it is only\r\nto be expected that they will take greater advantage of their legal\r\nindustrial advantage. The combinations that exist will be made stronger\r\nand more binding, and new ones will be formed. The French copper\r\n\"corner\" has taught men that under the broad protection of International\r\nlaw their schemes of industrial conquest may embrace the world; and it\r\nis not to be doubted that the temporary \"corner\" will yet result in a\r\nstrong permanent combination; and that the precedent set by this\r\nsuccessful monopoly will be eagerly followed by those who wish to secure\r\nlike profits by the control of some other form of mineral wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLIES OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the fact that the concentration of\r\nmanufacturing in large mills at great commercial centres has been made\r\npossible by the development of railway transportation, and that the\r\nrapid settlement of our Western prairies is due to the same agency; but\r\nit is worth while to note more fully the difference between ancient and\r\nmodern conditions in the business of transportation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is plain that no more than a century ago the\r\nworld had comparatively very little need for railways. Each community\r\nproduced from its farms and shops most of the things which it needed;\r\nand the interchange of goods between different sections, while\r\nconsiderable in the aggregate, was as nothing in comparison with modern\r\ndomestic commerce. The king's highways were open to every one, and\r\nthough monopolies for coach lines were sometimes granted and toll roads\r\nwere quite common, there was no possibility for any really harmful\r\nmonopoly in transportation to arise, because the necessity of\r\ntransportation was so small. Some writer has ascribed all the evils of\r\nmodern railway monopolies to the fact that in their establishment the\r\nold principle of English common law that the king's highway is open to\r\nevery man, was disregarded. But if we sift down this ancient maxim of\r\nlaw to its essential principle, we find it to be, _there must be no\r\nmonopoly in transportation_; and the problem of obtaining the advantages\r\nof modern railway transportation and keeping up, at the same time, the\r\nfree competition that exists in transportation on a highway is seen to\r\nbe as far from solution as before.\r\n\r\nThe importance of our railway traffic is proven by statistics. Of the\r\ntotal wealth annually produced in this country, it is probably a fair\r\nestimate to say that ten per cent. is paid for transportation of the raw\r\nmaterial and finished goods in their various journeys between producers,\r\ndealers, and consumers, and for transportation of passengers whose\r\njourneys directly or indirectly contribute to the nation's industry.\r\nThat is to say, the gross yearly earnings of all the railroads and\r\ntransportation lines of the country is about one tenth of the total\r\nvalue of all the year's products. The average is brought down by the\r\namount of sustenance still consumed in the locality where it is\r\nproduced, and by the amount of valuable merchandise. But of the bulky\r\nproducts like coal and grain, the greater part of the cost to the remote\r\nconsumer is due to the cost of carriage.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to a proper appreciation of the problem, that we\r\nunderstand that railway transportation is now as absolutely necessary as\r\nis the production of food and clothing. Annihilate the railway\r\ncommunications of any of our great cities, and thousands would perish by\r\nstarvation before they could scatter to agricultural regions. There was\r\ngreat suffering in many small communities in Minnesota and Dakota in\r\nthe severe winter of 1887-8, because the heavy storms blockaded the\r\nrailroads and prevented them from bringing in a supply of coal and\r\nprovisions. But it is not taking the question in its broadest sense to\r\nconsider whether we could eke out an existence without railway\r\ncommunication. The fact is that under modern conditions every man\r\nobtains all the things which he desires, not by producing them himself,\r\nbut by producing some one thing which others desire. The interchange\r\nbetween each producer and each consumer must, broadly speaking, be all\r\nmade by means of the railway; and without that, stores, factories,\r\nmills, mines, and farms, would have to cease operation.\r\n\r\nRemembering now the importance and necessity of transportation, let us\r\ninquire how the price at which it is sold to the public, the rate of\r\nfare and freight, is fixed. Is it or can it be generally fixed by\r\ncompetition?\r\n\r\nThere are now in the United States about 37,000 railway stations where\r\nfreight and passengers are received for transportation. Now, from the\r\nnature of the case, not more than ten per cent. of these are or can be\r\nat the junction of two or more lines of railway. (By actual count, on\r\nJanuary 1, 1887, eight per cent. of existing stations were junction\r\npoints.) Therefore the shippers and buyers of goods at nine-tenths of\r\nthe shipping points of the country must always be dependent on the\r\nfacilities and rates offered by a single railway. Such rates of\r\ntransportation as are fixed, be they high or low, must be paid, if\r\nbusiness is carried on at all. And when we consider the ten per cent. of\r\nrailway stations which are, or may be, junction points, we find that at\r\nleast three-fourths of them are merely the junction of two lines owned\r\nby the same company. Consolidation of railway lines has gone on very\r\nrapidly within the past few years and is undoubtedly destined to go much\r\nfurther. Of the 158,000 miles of railway in the country, about eighty\r\nper cent. is included in systems 500 miles or more in extent; and a\r\ndozen corporations control nearly half of the total mileage. The\r\nbenefits which the public receive from this consolidation are so vast\r\nand so necessary that no one who is familiar with railway affairs would\r\ndream of making the suggestion that further consolidations be stopped or\r\nthat past ones be undone.\r\n\r\nThere is a great tendency on the part of the public, however, to look\r\nwith fear and disfavor on further railway consolidation. And because\r\nthis is so, it is greatly to be desired that the beneficial effects of\r\nconsolidation should be better understood. The most important benefits\r\nare included under one head, the saving in expense and the avoidance of\r\nwaste, and this is effected in very many different ways. Suppose a great\r\nsystem like the Pennsylvania or the Chicago & Northwestern were cut up\r\ninto fifty or sixty independent roads, each with its own complete staff\r\nof officers. Each road would have to pay its president, directors, and\r\nheads of operating departments, would have to maintain its own\r\nrepair-shops, general offices, etc., and conduct in general all the\r\nbusiness necessary to the profitable operation of a railway corporation.\r\nA car of wheat or a passenger in going from Chicago to New York would\r\nhave to be transferred from one road to another at perhaps twenty\r\ndifferent points, and the freight or fare paid would be divided among\r\ntwenty different companies, with corresponding clerical labor. The\r\nmodern conveniences of through tickets, through baggage-checks, and\r\nthrough freight shipments, would be difficult, if not impossible.\r\nFurther, consolidation tends to produce vastly better service and\r\ngreater safety. The large systems can and do employ the highest grade of\r\ntalent to direct their work. Every thing is systematized and managed\r\nwith a view to producing the best results in efficiency and safety with\r\nthe least waste of material and labor. And while the improvement in\r\nsafety and convenience is all for the benefit of the public, a large\r\npart of the saving in expense effected by consolidation has likewise\r\ncome back to the patrons of the roads in the form of reduced rates of\r\nfare and freight.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, however, for any one not familiar with the technical\r\ndetails of the railway business to fully appreciate the importance and\r\nnecessity of the consolidations which have been effected, and the grave\r\nresults that would follow the realization of the mad proposition to set\r\nus back a half century by cutting up our railroad systems into short\r\nlocal lines. It must be plain to every one, however, that while the loss\r\nof all the benefits of consolidation would be certain, the gain in\r\ncompetition could affect only the few junction points; and as we shall\r\nnow see, the effect even on them would be small.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the total number of railway junction points in the United\r\nStates is 3,000, we find, on examination, that at about two-thirds only\r\ntwo lines meet, and at more than half the remainder only three lines\r\nmeet. It is plain that in the vast majority of cases where two roads\r\nintersect, and in many cases where three or four come together, the\r\nlines meet perhaps at right angles and diverge to entirely different\r\nlocalities. The shipper bringing goods to the station, then, may choose\r\nwhether he will send his goods north or east perhaps; but only in the\r\nfew cases where two lines run to the same point does he really have the\r\nchoice of two rates for getting his produce to market. Practically,\r\nthen, there are not, and never can be, more than a few hundred places in\r\nthe country where shippers will be able to choose different routes for\r\nsending their goods to market. We say there never can be, because the\r\nbuilding of a line of railway to parallel an existing line able to carry\r\nall the traffic is an absolute loss to the world of the capital spent in\r\nits construction, and a constant drain after it is built in the cost of\r\nits operation. This fact is now, fortunately, generally appreciated.\r\n\r\nBut what of the competitive traffic which exists between commercial\r\ncentres, like the trunk-line traffic between Chicago and the cities on\r\nthe seaboard, or between the former city and the collecting centres\r\nfarther west like St. Paul, Omaha, and Kansas City? Here, indeed, there\r\nis competition; and it is of great importance because of the enormous\r\nbulk of the traffic which traverses these few routes.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar feature of the railway business which we have now to\r\nconsider, and one which is not generally understood. We have already\r\nperceived the principle that competition cannot permanently exceed a\r\ncertain intensity; and the proof of this principle in the case of the\r\nrailway is remarkably plain. Suppose two roads are competing for the\r\ntraffic between Omaha and Chicago. A shipper at the former city who\r\nwishes to send a few tons of freight to Chicago may go to one company\r\nand ask their rates, then to the other and induce them to give him a\r\nlower rate, and then back to the first again, until he secures rates low\r\nenough to suit him. Now it is a fact that either company can afford to\r\ncarry this especial freight for less than the actual cost of carrying\r\nit better than it can afford to lose the shipment. This is because it\r\ncosts the company practically _no more_ to carry the goods than if they\r\nwere not shipped by its line; and hence whatever is received for the\r\nfreight is so much profit. Stated in the form of a principle, this fact\r\nis expressed thus: _Receipts from additional traffic are almost clear\r\nprofit_. Nor is this all. The practical impossibility of distinguishing\r\n_additional_ traffic from other traffic, and the enactment of State and\r\nNational laws requiring uniform rates to be charged, places all traffic\r\non a common basis; and the same cause which makes it more profitable to\r\ncarry additional traffic for a song than to lose it, makes it better for\r\na railroad to carry traffic, temporarily at least, for less than the\r\nactual running expenses of the road, rather than to lose it. The train\r\nand station service, the general office and shop expenses, must all be\r\nkept up, though the freight and passengers carried dwindle to almost\r\nnothing; and the capital invested in the road is a total loss, unless\r\nthe line is kept in operation and earns some income, even though it be\r\nsmall. This last influence, as we shall see later, is a most important\r\nand far-reaching one in its effect on industrial competition.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the intensity of competition in railway traffic is now\r\nevident. And from what we have seen, it follows that two railway lines\r\ncompeting freely with each other cannot possibly do business at a\r\nprofit. Let us see what are the actual results of this law of practical\r\nrailway management. Evidently the managers of two competing railway\r\nlines have but two possible courses open. They may, by tacit or formal\r\nagreement, unite in fixing common rates on both the roads, or they _may_\r\nattempt to do business with free competition. But we have already\r\nproven that the latter course must result in reducing the income of the\r\nroad certainly below the amount necessary to pay the operating expenses\r\nand the interest on the bonds, and probably it will be insufficient to\r\npay the running expenses alone. The inevitable result, then, is the\r\nbankruptcy of the weaker road, the appointment of a receiver, and its\r\nsale, in all probability to its stronger competitor. This is the chain\r\nof cause and effect which has wrought the consolidation of competing\r\nparallel roads in scores of cases, and which, if free competition is\r\nallowed to act, is sure to do so.\r\n\r\nWe can now appreciate the _necessity_ which managers of competing lines\r\nare under to agree upon uniform rates for traffic over their roads, and\r\nat the same time the difficulty of doing this. The strange paradox is\r\ntrue that while it is _necessary_ to the continued solvent existence of\r\nthe competing corporations that such an agreement be made, it is also\r\ngreatly to their advantage to break it secretly and secure additional\r\ntraffic. It is necessary, therefore, that the parties to the agreement\r\nbe strongly bound to maintain it inviolate; and to effect this, \"pools\"\r\nwere established. In pooling traffic, each company paid either the whole\r\nor a percentage of their traffic receipts into a common fund, which was\r\ndivided among the companies forming the pool, according to an agreed\r\nratio. Under this method it is evident that all incentive to secret\r\ncutting of rates and dishonest methods for stealing additional traffic\r\nfrom another road was taken away.\r\n\r\nHow widespread and universal is the restraint of competition by railway\r\ncorporations may be seen by the following pithy words, penned by Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, President of the Union Pacific Railway:\r\n\r\n     \"Irresponsive and secret combinations among railways always have\r\n     existed, and, so long as the railroad system continues as it now\r\n     is, they unquestionably always will exist. No law can make two\r\n     corporations, any more than two individuals, actively undersell\r\n     each other in any market, if they do not wish to do so. But they\r\n     can only cease doing so by agreeing, in public or private, on a\r\n     price below which neither will sell. If they cannot do this\r\n     publicly, they will assuredly do it secretly. This is what, with\r\n     alternations of conflict, the railroad companies have done in one\r\n     way or another; and this is what they are now doing and must always\r\n     continue to do, until complete change of conditions is brought\r\n     about. Against this practice, the moment it begins to assume any\r\n     character of responsibility or permanence, statutes innumerable\r\n     have been aimed, and clauses strictly interdicting it have of late\r\n     been incorporated into several State constitutions. The experience\r\n     of the last few years, if it has proved nothing else, has\r\n     conclusively demonstrated how utterly impotent and futile such\r\n     enactments and provisions necessarily are.\"\r\n\r\nDisregarding for the present the latter part of the above quotation,\r\nconsider the statement that during the whole history of railway\r\ncorporations, agreements to restrain competition have been the rule.\r\nThis the slightest research proves to be an historical fact, and it is\r\nin perfect accord with our preceding statement, that such agreements\r\nwere necessary to the solvent existence of railway corporations. The\r\nrecords also show that invariably when these agreements have been broken\r\nand competition has been allowed to have full play, the revenues of the\r\nroads have been rapidly reduced to a point where, unless a peace was\r\neffected, bankruptcy ensued.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams said, with truth, that no law had proven of any effect in\r\npreventing these competition-killing agreements between railways; but\r\nsince the above extract was written, the Interstate Commerce law has\r\nbeen enacted. Let us pay some attention to its working and results. It\r\nis a curious fact that the framers of railway legislation in this\r\ncountry, almost down to the present time, have concentrated all their\r\nenergies on the endeavor to keep up free competition; and the Interstate\r\nlaw is no exception to this rule. The plan of the Interstate law was\r\nabout as follows: \"Here are a few dozen great commercial centres where\r\nthe railway lines of different systems meet. We will first prohibit the\r\npooling by which they have restricted competition at these points. Then,\r\nin order that the thousands of other shipping points shall receive an\r\nequal benefit, we will enact a 'long and short haul clause,' obliging\r\nthe rates charged to be in some degree proportionate to the distance.\r\nThus competition at the great centres will bring rates down everywhere,\r\nand the public will be benefited.\"\r\n\r\nFor a year after the enactment of the law its effects were not\r\nprominent. Pooling was abolished, but the agreements to maintain rates\r\nwere still kept up and were fairly observed. But in 1888, the second\r\nyear of the law's working, it came to be realized that the pool was the\r\nvital strength of the agreement to maintain rates, and that this\r\nagreement might now be easily broken. Then ensued a remarkable season of\r\nrate cutting, which, at the present writing, has reduced many strong\r\ncompanies to the verge of bankruptcy. It is plain enough that if this is\r\nallowed to go on, the various stages of receivership, sale, and\r\nconsolidation will follow in regular order. To avoid this too sudden\r\nrevolution and the general financial disaster which all sudden\r\nrevolutions entail, the principal companies in the West are now striving\r\nto combine in an association for the maintenance of rates by a plan\r\nwhich will bind them more closely together than any other ever before\r\nadopted. Thus to quote Mr. Adams again: \"The Interstate Commerce law has\r\ngiven a new impetus to the process of gravitation and consolidation,\r\nand it is now going on much more rapidly than ever before. It is at this\r\nmoment rapidly driving us forward toward some grand railroad-trust\r\nscheme.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a fact which we shall do well to ponder over, that this\r\nlegislation intended to stimulate competition has finally had just the\r\nopposite effect from that which its makers desired. They did increase\r\nthe intensity of the competition, and have thereby nearly brought about\r\na permanent end to all competition in railway traffic.\r\n\r\nIt must now be clear that the railway is essentially a monopoly, not, be\r\nit noted, because of any especial wickedness of its managers or owners,\r\nbut because competition is _impossible_ as regards the greater part of\r\nits business, and because wherever competition is possible, its effect,\r\nas the managers well know, would be to annihilate all profits from the\r\noperation of the road.\r\n\r\nLet us consider now some of the evils with which this monopoly is\r\ncharged. The first of these is _discrimination_ between persons and\r\nbetween places. A favored shipper has been enabled to ruin his\r\ncompetitors because he could obtain special rates, while they, perhaps,\r\nwere charged an extra amount. The strong monopolies have in this way\r\nbeen able to strengthen their hands for the purpose of throttling their\r\nweak competitors. Passenger rates, too, have been low to one class and\r\nhigh to another; and the system of free passes has led to great abuses.\r\nDiscrimination between towns and cities and States has been hardly less\r\nserious; and while the railways were permitted to make high local rates\r\nand low through rates, a great stimulus was given to the city at the\r\nexpense of the country. The second class of evils is that rates in\r\nthemselves have been too high. The railways have been wastefully built\r\nand then capitalized at double their actual cost, and it has been\r\nattempted to pay dividends of 6 to 10 per cent. on these securities. In\r\nsome cases the principle of charging \"what the traffic will bear\" has\r\nbeen so applied that industries have been ruined through the absorption\r\nof their profits by unjust transportation charges. But our space will\r\nnot permit a comprehensive review of the many abuses of railway\r\nmanagement. They are already familiar to the public. We needed only to\r\nrefer to them sufficiently to carry on our argument by showing that the\r\nrailroad monopoly is not by any means a harmless monopoly if left to\r\nwork its own pleasure.\r\n\r\nThere are two evils of our present railway system, however, which are\r\nnot chargeable to monopoly, but to the _attempt to defeat monopoly_, and\r\nwhich are important to our discussion. The first is the waste of\r\ncompetition in railway traffic; the second, the waste of competition by\r\nthe construction and _threatened_ construction of competing lines where\r\npresent facilities are ample for the traffic. Of the first it need only\r\nbe said that in advertising, \"drumming,\" and soliciting patronage the\r\nrailways spend many millions of dollars every year, which comes out of\r\nthe pockets of the public. The second is most serious, for it involves a\r\nfar greater waste. It is a conservative estimate to say that 5 per cent.\r\nof the railways of the country were only built to divide the profits of\r\nolder roads, and that their owners would be delighted to-day to have\r\ntheir money back in their possession and the railroad wiped out. The\r\nmillions these roads have cost, the millions required every year to\r\nmaintain and operate them, the millions spent on proposed roads that\r\nnever reached completion, and the millions squandered in fighting\r\nproposed roads by every means short of actual bloodshed,--these are\r\nsome of the wastes which we have made in our endeavor to create\r\ncompetition in railway transportation. And with all our efforts, and\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that until within a short time the public\r\nsentiment and the railway managers have been united in the belief that\r\nfree competition was the only mode of regulating railroad rates, we are\r\nfarther removed from free competition now than ever before.\r\n\r\nAnd now consider in addition to all this the fact that every railway\r\ncompany must first of all secure from the State a right to exercise the\r\nsovereign power of Eminent Domain, and that it may and does choose and\r\ntake every advantage of the favorable locations where its road can be\r\nbuilt most cheaply; which natural highways, mountain passes, and the\r\nlike, are gifts of Nature, the right to whose use equitably belongs to\r\nthe general public, and not to private parties exclusively. Taking these\r\nfacts also into consideration, it seems needless to offer further proof\r\nof the fact that the business of railway transportation is essentially a\r\nmonopoly, and that the attempt to regulate it by competition must always\r\nprove a failure in the future, as it always has in the past.\r\n\r\nNecessarily we have limited our discussion to the most salient points,\r\nand have not touched at all many of the complicated details of the\r\nrailway problem. In a later chapter we can study farther the evils due\r\nto railway monopolies, and the proper remedies therefor. At present we\r\nhave accomplished our purpose in finding out the fact that railways are\r\nmonopolies, and that they are so by their inherent nature.\r\n\r\nOf monopolies in other forms of internal transportation, but little need\r\nbe said. Our once busy canals and great rivers seem destined, with the\r\nconstant rapid improvement and cheapening in the carriage of goods by\r\nrail, to lose all their former importance. The monopolies small and\r\ngreat that once held sway there have all vanished before their strong\r\nrival, the railway.\r\n\r\nThe use of steam in the vessels that navigate the ocean has had an\r\neffect very similar to the replacing of stage-coaches and freight wagons\r\nby the locomotive. Where hundreds of sailing vessels plied their slow\r\nand uncertain trade, steamer lines now make trips only less regular than\r\nthe railway itself. The only cause for the existence of a monopoly in\r\nocean traffic by steam is the greatly increased capital required for a\r\nrival steamship line as compared with that needed for the old sailing\r\nvessels. We find this, the requirement of a large capital, to be a\r\nfeature of more or less importance in nearly every monopoly of the\r\npresent day. In this case, however, unless there is an artificial\r\nmonopoly in the shape of government aid or authorization, the strength\r\nof its capital is the only power the monopoly has.\r\n\r\nWe may reach a clear idea of the essential nature of all the monopolies\r\nconsidered in this chapter by considering an especial class of\r\nmonopolies of communication, namely, mountain passes, bridges, and ship\r\ncanals. If a person or a railway corporation could secure sole control\r\nof the only pass through a high mountain range separating two wealthy\r\nand populous districts producing goods of different sorts, they might\r\nexact a princely yearly revenue for its use, equal to the interest on\r\nthe capital required to secure an equally favorable passage by\r\ntunnelling, or the annual cost of sending goods over some longer and\r\nmore expensive route. But under the law no private person would be\r\nallowed to do this; and if the pass were a very important and necessary\r\none, probably no one railway company would be allowed to do so. The law\r\nrecognizes to some extent, and should recognize much more than it does,\r\nthe fact that the benefit of this natural pathway is not the property of\r\nany one man or set of men, but equitably belongs equally to every person\r\nwho needs to use it directly or remotely.\r\n\r\nA very large and expensive bridge is like an important mountain pass,\r\ndiffering only in that one is the gift of Nature, while the other is\r\nwholly the work of man. But because the latter is the work of man, it\r\ndoes not follow that it is not a monopoly. The great bridge across the\r\nMississippi River at St. Louis is owned by a private company which\r\nlevies tolls for the teams and trains passing over it. These are deemed\r\nexcessive, as they are sufficient to pay an exorbitant interest on the\r\ncost of the bridge. Yet for many years no one has cared to invest money\r\nin the erection of a new bridge, for they saw that there was no more\r\ntraffic than one bridge could readily carry, and they knew that if a new\r\nbridge were erected, in the rivalry in tolls which would ensue, the\r\nold-established company would probably bankrupt its rival. It is thus\r\nplainly seen how an important bridge may become a monopoly, and a most\r\npowerful and onerous one.\r\n\r\nWe have still one important monopoly of communication to describe, the\r\ntelegraph. Viewed from a narrow standpoint it may be thought that there\r\nshould be no monopoly in the telegraph. A telegraph line is not\r\nexpensive to erect and maintain, and it gets no monopoly from taking\r\nadvantage of the most favorable route through difficult country as a\r\nrailway does. But the economy effected by combination and the effect of\r\nsharp competition in bringing about bankruptcy and then consolidation\r\nare exactly similar to the case of the railway, which we have just\r\ndescribed. In the early history of telegraph companies, many short\r\ncompeting lines struggled and fought for supremacy. In 1859 the Western\r\nUnion Telegraph Company was formed with the avowed intention of\r\ncombining these warring companies and making the telegraph business\r\nprofitable. It has exceeded the most sanguine dreams of its promoters by\r\nswallowing up its rivals until the entire system of telegraph\r\ncommunication of the country is practically in its hands. The effects of\r\nthis consolidation have been of two sorts. On the one hand we have the\r\ntelegraph service of the country performed with the least possible work;\r\nthere is nothing wasted in the maintenance of two or more rival offices\r\nin small towns where one is sufficient, nor in operating two lines of\r\nwire where a single one would serve as well. All expense of \"drumming\r\nup\" business in various ways is avoided, and also the cost of keeping\r\nthe complicated books necessary when the receipts of a single message\r\nmust be divided among several companies. On the other hand it is plain\r\nthat the public is wholly at the mercy of the monopoly in the matter of\r\nrates, and must pay for the use of the telegraph exactly what the\r\ncorporation asks. There is a weak and foolish argument which is often\r\nused in an attempt to show that this particular monopoly is not hurtful.\r\nIt is that the telegraph is a luxury which only wealthy people use, and\r\nhence whether its rates are high or low is of little account. The\r\nfallacy of this statement is easily seen. A principal use of the\r\ntelegraph is to aid the prosecution of business; hence to unduly raise\r\nrates is to cause an additional tax on business,--on the carrying on of\r\nthe processes of production. This tax will certainly have its effect,\r\neither in decreased profits, decreased wages, or an increased price for\r\nthe product. Another large class of telegrams are those which are sent\r\nwith little thought of the cost, in time of sickness, death, or sudden\r\nemergency, yet by people whose purse feels severely the tax.\r\n\r\nWhat to do with this vast monopoly is one of the questions of the day,\r\nbut we will content ourselves at present with this investigation of its\r\ncharacter, reserving its proper treatment for later consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL MONOPOLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people who live in cities are far more dependent on monopolies than\r\nthe resident of the country. The farmer can still, on necessity, return\r\nto the custom of primitive times, and supply himself with food,\r\nclothing, fuel, and shelter without aid from the outside world; but the\r\ncity dweller must supply all his wants by purchasing, and is absolutely\r\ndependent on his fellow-men for the actual necessaries, as well as the\r\nluxuries of life. From the peculiar circumstances of city life, many\r\nmonopolies arise in production and transportation which occur nowhere\r\nelse. One of these is the carriage of passengers on street and suburban\r\nrailways. There is no better instance, perhaps, of the great power which\r\nis placed in the hands of railway managers than this matter of suburban\r\npassenger traffic. One example must suffice to show this. Let us suppose\r\nthat the managers of a railway, which has hitherto not been run with a\r\nview to the development of suburban traffic, secure control of several\r\nchoice tracts of land on the line of their road near a growing city, and\r\nestablish low rates of commutation and frequent and convenient train\r\nservice. The land which they purchased is sold out in building-lots for\r\nmany times its cost, and a number of thriving villages become\r\nestablished there, inhabited chiefly by people whose business is in the\r\ncity and who are obliged to go back and forth on the trains. After a\r\nnumber of years the growth of the towns becomes more sluggish, and the\r\nmanagers find that the commutation traffic is not after all extremely\r\nprofitable; therefore they lessen their train service and increase the\r\nrates of fare. Perhaps they may abolish commutation rates altogether. It\r\nis a well known fact that the value of suburban real estate depends\r\nalmost entirely on the convenience and cheapness of access to the city.\r\nBy the removal and forced sale, which many of these people will be\r\nobliged to make, it may easily happen that they may lose their entire\r\nproperty. It is not stated that such flagrant cases of autocracy on the\r\npart of railway managers are common. Indeed, it is a high compliment to\r\nthe uprightness and probity of these men that such occurrences are so\r\ninfrequent, and that the temptation, so constantly presented, of\r\nenriching one's self at the expense of the owners of the road and the\r\npublic is yielded to so seldom. But there have been cases where railway\r\nmanagers have secured excellent train service and low rates of fare to\r\nbenefit places where they held an interest in real estate, while other\r\nand competing places were given poor service and high rates. And the\r\nentire abolition of long-established commutation rates has happened more\r\nthan once.\r\n\r\nBut turning now to the city railways proper, those carrying passengers\r\nthrough the streets, it is evident at first sight that we have another\r\ncase where competition is a factor of little account. The power of this\r\nmonopoly for harm is greatly intensified by the fact that its use is\r\nlargely a necessity. In all our great cities the business sections are\r\nfar removed from the residence sections, and the great mass of the\r\nindustrial population is _obliged_ to ride at least twice each day in\r\ngoing to and returning from work. In nine cases out of ten there is one\r\nroute so much more convenient than any other as to overbalance any\r\nslight difference of fare. Thus, even on the supposition that every\r\ndifferent line was run in competition with every other line, the amount\r\nof really competitive business would be but a trifle. But besides this,\r\nas is well known, in a great many cities consolidation has gone on as\r\nrapidly among street-railway companies as among the great trunk-line\r\nrailways. The three lines of New York elevated roads were originally\r\nprojected by rival companies; but they were not long in coming together\r\nunder one management. A Philadelphia syndicate has secured control of\r\nmost of the street railways of that city, and in addition has purchased\r\na number of the lines in Boston, Chicago, Pittsburg, and St. Louis.\r\nAlthough the benefit in economy by consolidation is much less in the\r\ncase of street railways than in the case of steam roads, yet\r\nconsiderable is gained, and the competition which is killed by the\r\nconsolidation is, as we have just seen, of no great importance to the\r\npublic. The so-called street-railway trust, then, is really of no great\r\nmoment. The monopoly in street-railway traffic arises from the nature of\r\nthe business rather than from any especial effort of capitalists to kill\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nBut the railway companies are not the only monopolies which have the use\r\nof our city streets. Water, gas, and steam pipes beneath the pavements,\r\nand wires, either in subways or strung overhead, carrying electricity\r\nfor street and domestic lighting, telegraph, telephone, and messenger\r\nservice, are all necessities to our modern civilization.\r\n\r\nThe absolute necessity of a public water supply, and the practical\r\nimpossibility in most cases that any competition in the furnishing\r\nthereof can be established and maintained, have led, in the case of most\r\nof our large cities, to the work of water supply being undertaken by the\r\nmunicipal authorities. But many of our smaller cities have entrusted to\r\nprivate companies the work of furnishing a water supply. While this is a\r\ncase of real monopoly, yet under the conditions which may be enforced,\r\nmost of the power for harm is taken away. According to the best plan in\r\nvogue, the city sells the franchise for constructing the works to the\r\ncompany who bids to furnish water at the lowest rates under definitely\r\nspecified conditions, the franchise being sometimes perpetual, but\r\noftener granting to the city at some future date an option for the\r\npurchase of the works. It is to be particularly noticed that this is a\r\ncase in which the administration of an absolute monopoly has been\r\nentrusted to private enterprise with excellent results; a fact which may\r\nbe of use to us in our later investigation.\r\n\r\nWhile the fact was early appreciated that a water supply when once\r\nintroduced became an absolute necessity, it was not recognized when\r\nilluminating gas was first brought into use how important it was to\r\nbecome. Franchises, or more properly permits, for erecting works and\r\nlaying mains for supplying consumers were given away to hastily formed\r\ncompanies; and even at the present time there are but a few cities (only\r\nfive in the United States) which own their works and mains for supplying\r\ngas. As a matter of course the gas companies saw their advantage.\r\nKnowing that gas once introduced was a necessity at almost any price,\r\nthey made no move toward lowering rates as new and cheaper methods came\r\ninto vogue and their output and profits increased. The stocks of our\r\ngas companies have been swollen by enormous amounts of water, and upon\r\nthis fictitious capital they have continually paid enormous dividends.\r\nAt one time there was a great call for competition in the gas business.\r\nThe public demanded it, and as usual the demand was supplied. Rival\r\ncompanies were organized, and the city authorities made haste to grant\r\nthem permits for laying their mains in the city streets. A war of rates\r\nof course ensued, and lasted till one company gave up the fight and sold\r\nout to its rival. The consolidated company promptly increased its stock\r\nby at least the amount which had been spent in purchasing and laying\r\nthis extra and entirely needless set of gas mains. The public has to pay\r\ninterest on this sum, and suffer besides the damage done to the\r\npavements by tearing up and re-laying.\r\n\r\nIn at least twenty cities of the United States has this farce been\r\nrepeated, and in every case with the same result. It is now generally\r\nacknowledged that the attempt to regulate the price of gas by\r\ncompetition is unwise and harmful. Prof. E. J. James, of the University\r\nof Pennsylvania, in a monograph entitled \"The Relation of the Modern\r\nMunicipality to the Gas Supply,\" has treated this subject most fully. He\r\ndescribes the experience of cities in England, France, and Germany,\r\nwhere competition has been tried and abandoned, it being found by dear\r\nexperience that the gas business is necessarily a monopoly. A\r\nCongressional Committee, who reported on the application of a rival gas\r\ncompany which proposed to lay mains in the city of Washington, declared\r\nthat \"it is bad policy to permit more than one gas company in the same\r\npart of the city.\" One of the best informed men in the gas business\r\nsays: \"The business is almost outside of the domain of rules governing\r\nother enterprises. Competition is so deadly to it that it is impossible\r\nfor rival companies to occupy the same street without ruin to both, or\r\nwithout consolidation with its attendant double investment, and cheap\r\nlight is thus rendered an impossibility.\"\r\n\r\nHon. T. M. Cooley says:\r\n\r\n     \"The supply of public conveniences to a city is usually a monopoly,\r\n     and the protection of the public against excessive charges is to be\r\n     found first in the municipal power of control. Except in the very\r\n     large cities, public policy requires that for supplying light and\r\n     water there should be but one corporation, because one can perform\r\n     the service at lower rates than two or more, and in the long run\r\n     will be sure to do so. In some kinds of business competition will\r\n     keep corporations within bounds in their charges; in others it will\r\n     not. When it will not, it may become necessary to legislate upon\r\n     profits.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering it determined, therefore, that the gas industry is a\r\nmonopoly, let us inquire something of the manner in which this monopoly\r\nregulates the prices for its service. According to recent statistics,\r\ncollected from 683 gas companies in the United States, 148 companies\r\ncharge $2 per thousand cubic feet, and 145 companies charge $2.50 per\r\nthousand. It is thus seen that rates have been fixed to make \"even\r\nfigures,\" something which does not occur when margins of profit are\r\nreduced by competition. The complete table shows this fact more fully as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    7 companies charge $1.00 per thousand cubic feet.\r\n   32    \"         \"    1.50  \"     \"      \"     \"\r\n   24    \"         \"    1.75  \"     \"      \"     \"\r\n  148    \"         \"    2.00  \"     \"      \"     \"\r\n   57    \"         \"    2.25  \"     \"      \"     \"\r\n  145    \"         \"    2.50  \"     \"      \"     \"\r\n   20 companies charge  2.75 per thousand cubic feet.\r\n   86    \"         \"    3.00  \"     \"      \"     \"\r\n   25    \"         \"    3.50  \"     \"      \"     \"\r\n   19    \"         \"    4.00  \"     \"      \"     \"\r\n  120 companies charge various other prices per thousand cubic feet.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same authority these companies in 1886 produced\r\n23,050,706,000 cubic feet of gas, for which they received $40,744,673,\r\nan average price per M. of $1.76-71/100. According to the statement of\r\ngood authorities, gas can be manufactured at a cost of 50 to 75 cents\r\nper M. in this country. Prof. James, in his work before quoted, says:\r\n\"In England at the present time gas is manufactured at a net cost of 30\r\ncents per thousand feet; some works in New England now manufacture it\r\nfor 38 cents per thousand feet to the holder.\" The President of the\r\nAmerican Gas-Light Association is quoted as stating in an address before\r\nthe Association that the cost of the gas delivered to consumers by the\r\nSouth Metropolitan Company of London in 1883 was 39.65 cents per\r\nthousand, and figuring by the relative cost of coal and labor there and\r\nhere, he stated that gas could be delivered in New York at a cost of 65\r\ncents per thousand. In Germany the price of gas to consumers varies from\r\n61 cents in Cologne to $1.02 in Berlin. Very recent improvements in\r\nprocesses have greatly cheapened the cost of manufacture. Mr. Henry\r\nWoodall, the engineer of the Leeds, England, gas-works, states that\r\ncoal-gas costs in the holder 22 cents per thousand. Of nineteen\r\ncompanies doing business in principal English cities, the average rate\r\ncharged consumers is 52½ cents, and the average cost of manufacture\r\nis 37-1/3 cents.\r\n\r\nThe history of the gas monopoly is repeating itself in the matter of\r\nelectric lighting. The smaller cities of the country, in their haste to\r\n\"boom,\" are ready to grant a liberal franchise to the first firm or\r\ncompany which offers to supply an electric-lighting system, trusting to\r\nfuture competition to regulate prices, a resource that must prove of no\r\navail. Nor are the men in power in our larger cities any wiser. The city\r\nof New York is taking every means to encourage the operation of rival\r\nelectric-light companies, and is letting yearly contracts for\r\nstreet-lighting to the lowest bidder. It is true that competition is\r\nactive just now, but it requires no far-seeing eye to discern the\r\ninevitable combination and consolidation among the companies.\r\n\r\nAgain, not only is competition of this sort sure to fail, but the\r\nattempt to establish it is very harmful. To say nothing of the expense\r\nand waste of wealth which is involved when rival companies are allowed\r\nto stretch their wires and establish their extensive central stations in\r\nthe same district, it is everywhere acknowledged that the multiplication\r\nof wires overhead is a crying evil and danger. Are we to double and\r\ntreble it, then, by permitting rival companies to place their wires\r\nwherever they please? It is evident that the temporary rivalry which we\r\nobtain in this way is bought at much too great a cost. What is true of\r\nelectric street light wires is equally true of the vastly greater\r\nmultitude of wires which belong to our rapidly growing system of\r\ndomestic lighting, and the telegraph, telephone, and messenger service.\r\nSurely no man knoweth the beginning or the end of the network which is\r\nwoven over our heads, and which, besides all the useful wires already\r\nenumerated, is full of \"dead\" wires, many of them strung by defunct or\r\nirresponsible companies, who would never have been allowed to obstruct\r\nthe streets if they had not been \"competing\" for the business. Can there\r\nbe any doubt that it is the height of folly to continue this work, and\r\nthat the only rational way of entrusting electric service to\r\nincorporated companies is to permit but a single company to operate in a\r\ndistrict and control prices by some other means than competition?\r\n\r\nWe have the beginnings of other monopolies in our city economies which\r\nare destined to become much more important, but to which we need only\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\nSteam for supplying heat and power is beginning to be distributed from\r\ngreat central stations, through mains laid underground, to all parts of\r\nthe surrounding district. The necessity for frequent repairs and\r\nstoppage of leaks renders it necessary to break the pavement and dig\r\ndown to the mains much oftener than is required for any other of our\r\nunderground furniture. Nothing would seem more evident than that the\r\nnumber of these pipes to be laid should be the fewest consistent with\r\nthe proper supply of the district, yet it is a fact that for a time two\r\ncompeting steam companies were permitted to run riot in the streets of\r\nlower New York, until the weaker one succumbed \"to over-pressure.\" Yet\r\nit is scarcely to be doubted, that if another rival company were to ask\r\nfor a permit to operate in the district now monopolized by the New York\r\nSteam Company, public opinion would tend to favor the granting of the\r\npermit \"because it would give more competition.\" It is to be hoped that\r\nbefore these great systems for the distribution from central stations of\r\nvarious necessities reach much greater proportions, the public will\r\nbecome educated enough to perceive the folly of attempting to regulate\r\nthem by competition.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for this will be more, rather than less, apparent with the\r\nuse of underground instead of overhead wires. The cost of placing wires\r\nin subways is far beyond the cost of stringing them on poles, and if we\r\nare obliged to build our subways large enough to accommodate all the\r\nrival wires which may be offered, we have a herculean task upon our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe great question of the monopoly of land can be merely touched in this\r\nconnection. While the fact that land is natural wealth must be freely\r\nacknowledged, it is only where population is most dense that any great\r\nmonopoly appears in its ownership. The principle is well established,\r\nindeed, that private ownership of land cannot stand in the way of the\r\npublic good. When a railway is to be built, any man who refuses to sell\r\nright of way to the railway company at a reasonable price may have it\r\njudicially condemned and taken from him. We have already noted in the\r\nchapter on railway monopolies the injustice of permitting a single\r\nperson or corporation to control and own any especially necessary means\r\nof communication, as a mountain pass or a long and expensive bridge, and\r\nthe same principle is apparent in connection with the railway terminals\r\nin our large cities. The enormous expense attendant upon securing right\r\nof way for an entrance to the heart of the city, makes it a very\r\ndifficult matter for any new company to obtain a terminus there, except\r\nby securing running rights over the tracks of an older company. To give\r\nto any single corporation the sole control of the entrance to a city\r\n_and permit it to charge what toll it pleases_ for trains that pass\r\nthrough it, evidently places the city at the mercy of a monopoly.\r\nPractically the case is not so bad as this, as most large cities have\r\nmeans of water communication, and the railroads are run to the heart of\r\nthe city through the public streets. But the time is fast approaching\r\nwhen these city grade crossings will be done away with, and in every\r\ncity of importance the railways will enter the city on elevated viaducts\r\nterminating in a single union depot. Evidently it is contrary to the\r\npublic welfare to sink more capital in these expensive structures than\r\nis necessary; and in general, several companies will use a single\r\nstructure for entrance and exit. It is evident that the control of these\r\nterminals, if vested in a single company, may give rise to just the\r\nabuse we have set forth; and that the city itself should retain enough\r\ncontrol over its railway terminals and freight-transfer lines to ensure\r\nthat no single carrier or combination shall monopolize them.\r\n\r\nIn the last analysis it is evident that the monopoly of entrance to a\r\ncity is really a monopoly in land, or, we might more properly say, in\r\nspace. We are fortunate in this country in having millions of acres of\r\nland still awaiting cultivation; and while it is not intended here to\r\ndefend the policy of _giving away_ the estate of the public which our\r\ngovernment has pursued, there is no danger for a long time to come that\r\nan actual monopoly will exist in agricultural lands. The price of land\r\nused for business purposes in a city, however, depends almost wholly\r\nupon its location. The price at which a single block of land near Wall\r\nStreet, in New York City, was recently sold was so great that, at the\r\nsame price, the value of a square mile would be equal to half the whole\r\nestimated wealth of every sort in the United States.\r\n\r\nNow the question must occur to every thinking man, by what right does\r\nthe owner of this property receive this enormous wealth? To make the\r\ncase of those who advocate the public control of the gifts of Nature\r\nmore clear, let us consider a special case. Suppose a man in an Eastern\r\ncity chanced to come into possession two-score years ago of a tract of\r\nland in what is now Kansas City. We may suppose that he got it by\r\ninheritance, or through some chance, and that, except to pay the taxes\r\nupon it, he has never given farther attention to it. During all the\r\nyears of the city's rapid growth he pays no attention to his land and\r\ntakes no part in furthering the growth of the city. At last, at the\r\nheight of the real-estate boom, he sells the land, and, whereas it cost\r\nhim in the first instance a merely nominal sum, perhaps $100, he sells\r\nit now for $100,000. This value it has, not because of itself, as is the\r\ncase with farming lands, but because of its situation in reference to\r\nthe community around it. In other words, practically the whole value of\r\nthis land has been given it by the people who have come and built this\r\ncity around it. It is their labor that has given this property its\r\nvalue, and, in equity, the value should be theirs. A more detailed\r\nstatement of the arguments for the public control of land incomes cannot\r\nbe given here. What we are concerned with here is the extent to which\r\nland is subject to a monopoly. It appears too evident to require further\r\ndiscussion that, as a general rule, agricultural lands in every section\r\nof the country are competing to a greater or less extent with lands in\r\nevery other section, and that the lands used for business purposes in\r\nthe cities compete likewise, each city with others neighboring and of\r\nsimilar size, while lands in the same city similarly situated compete\r\nwith each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLIES IN TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now examined the various forces which are destroying competition\r\nin the production of goods in our factories, and of raw material from\r\nour mines; in the transportation of these goods in their various\r\njourneys between the producer and the consumer, and in the supply of the\r\nespecial needs of the dwellers in our cities.\r\n\r\nIt is an old and well-worn adage that \"competition is the life of\r\ntrade\"; and if this be true, we shall certainly not expect to find the\r\nmen who are earning their living by the purchase and sale of goods\r\nendeavoring to take away the life of their business by restraining or\r\ndestroying competition. At first sight it seems as if it would be a\r\ndifficult matter in any case to destroy competition in trade. The buyer\r\nand seller of merchandise has no exclusive control over natural wealth;\r\nno mine or necessary channel of transportation is under his direction;\r\nnor does he in his trade produce any thing, as does the manufacturer. He\r\nonly serves the public by acting the part of a reservoir to equalize and\r\nfacilitate the flow between the consumers and producers; and if\r\nnecessity requires, the two can deal directly with each other and leave\r\nhim out altogether. But in dealing with the question of monopolies we\r\nmust not conclude that the absolute control of supply is at all\r\nnecessary to the existence of a monopoly. While there are monopolies, as\r\nwe have seen, which have the keys to some of the necessities of\r\ncivilized life, there are others which control merely some _easier\r\nmeans_ for their production, carriage, or distribution; and to this\r\nlatter class belong the principal monopolies in trade. To be sure that\r\nthis constitutes a monopoly, we have but to turn to the case of the\r\nmountain pass mentioned in a former chapter. The use of that particular\r\npass for transporting goods is only an _easier means_ of transportation\r\nthan the detour to some other pass or by some other route; and the\r\ndegree of power of the monopoly depends directly on the amount which is\r\nsaved by the use of its facilities. So with the monopolies in trade.\r\nBrokers and jobbers and retail merchants form a channel through which\r\ntrade is accustomed to pass, and through which it can pass more readily\r\nthan by any new one.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that under modern conditions the power of middle-men\r\nhas been greatly reduced from what it was formerly. As we have already\r\nseen, manufacturing was then carried on only in families and small\r\nworkshops, and the mines which were worked were principally in the hands\r\nof the king. The merchants were the wealthy men of olden time. They\r\ncontrolled largely the transportation facilities of that day; and while,\r\nas we have already noted, the commerce which then existed was but a\r\ntrifle compared with the present, the principal exchange being in local\r\ncommunities, yet the trade in all articles which were imported, and all\r\ndomestic commerce between points any great distance apart was in the\r\nhands of the merchants.\r\n\r\nIt is natural, therefore, that we find monopolies in trade to have been\r\namong the first which existed and to have been of importance and power\r\nwhen manufacturers' trusts were not dreamed of. The guilds which\r\nflourished near the close of the Middle Ages, while not devoted to the\r\nestablishment of a monopoly, did nevertheless aim, in some cases at\r\nleast, to hinder competition from those outside their guild.\r\n\r\nBut turning to the present, let us examine the conditions under which\r\ncompetition in trade is checked to-day. Let us take, first, the case of\r\nretail trade in any of the thousands of country villages and petty trade\r\ncentres in the land. The history of the life of the country store-keeper\r\nis a constant succession of combinations and agreements with his rivals,\r\ninterleaved with periods of \"running,\" when, in a fit of spite, he sells\r\nkerosene and sugar below cost, and, to make future prices seem\r\nconsistent, marks down new calico as \"shop-worn--for half price.\" It is\r\ntrue the sum involved in each case is a petty one, but when we consider\r\nthe enormous volume of goods which is distributed through these\r\nchannels, the total effect of the monopoly in raising the cost of goods\r\nto the consumer must approach that effected by monopolies of much wider\r\nfame. But perhaps it may not seem evident that this is a monopoly of the\r\nsame nature (not of the same degree) as a manufacturers' trust or a\r\nrailroad pool. It certainly _seems_ to be true that the merchant has a\r\nright to do as he chooses with his own property; and that if he and his\r\nneighbor over the way agree to charge uniform prices for their goods, it\r\nis no one's business but their own. And, indeed, we are not yet ready to\r\ntake up the question of right and wrong in this matter. That the act is\r\nessentially a \"combination in restriction of competition,\" however, is\r\nself-evident. The degree of this monopoly may vary widely. If the\r\nmerchants who effect this combination raise their prices far above what\r\nwill secure them a fair profit on the capital invested in their\r\nbusiness, and if it is difficult for their customers to reach any other\r\nsource of supply outside of the combination, the monopoly will have\r\nconsiderable power. On the other hand, if the stores of another village\r\nare easy of access, or if the merchants who form the combination fix\r\ntheir prices at no exorbitant point, the effect of the monopoly may be\r\nvery slight indeed.\r\n\r\nWe find this class of trade monopolies most powerful and effective on\r\nthe frontier. Wherever railroad communication is easy and cheap the\r\ntradesmen of different towns--between whom combinations are seldom\r\nformed--compete with each other. The extension of postal, express, and\r\nrailway-freight facilities to all parts of the country, too, have made\r\nit possible for country buyers to purchase in the cities, if necessary.\r\nThus the railways have been a chief instrument in _lessening_ the power\r\nof this species of monopoly in country retail trade, which was of great\r\npower and importance a half century ago.\r\n\r\nOf retail trade in the cities, it is not necessary to speak at length.\r\nCombination here has seldom been found practicable because of the great\r\nnumber of competing units. There is, however, a noticeable tendency of\r\nlate to the concentration of the trade in large establishments, which by\r\ntheir prestige and capital are able to take away business from their\r\nsmaller competitors. It does not seem likely, however, that this\r\nmovement will result in any very injurious monopoly among city\r\nretailers.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale trade is on quite a different basis from the retail. The\r\nnumber of competitors being so much less, combination is vastly easier.\r\nThe tendency toward it has been greatly fostered and strengthened by the\r\nformation of trusts among the producers. These combinations made the\r\nmanufacturer more independent in his treatment of jobbers, and disposed\r\nhim to cut their profits to the lowest point. Naturally these men\r\ncombined to resist this encroachment on their income. They refused to\r\nhandle any goods for less than a certain minimum commission. It might be\r\npossible in many cases for manufacturers to sell directly to the retail\r\ntraders, but in general the difficulty of changing old commercial\r\nchannels is such that the friction and expense is less if the goods are\r\npermitted to pass through the wholesaler's hands. It is to be noted that\r\none cause for ill-feeling between manufacturer and wholesaler is the\r\nfact that before the days of trusts the latter often reaped much greater\r\nproportionate profits than the producer himself. But in time this cause\r\nof dissension will be forgotten, and the trust and the wholesalers'\r\nassociation will work in harmony.\r\n\r\nThe point of greatest interest in this is the fact that combinations\r\namong this first class of middlemen are fostered and made possible by\r\nthe combination of producers. Nor does the series end here necessarily.\r\nThe increased price which the retail dealers are obliged to pay for the\r\ngoods, with the fact that others are making larger profits, makes them\r\neager to do the same; and by the aid and co-operation of the wholesale\r\nmerchants they may be able to do much toward checking competition among\r\nthemselves and increasing their profits. Thus by the operation of the\r\ncombination at the fountain-head among the producers, there is a\r\ntendency to check competition all along the line, and grant to each\r\nhandler of the goods between producer and consumer an abnormal profit.\r\nAn excellent example of this is found in the sugar trade. The wholesale\r\nGrocers' Guild of Canada, which includes 96 per cent. of the Dominion's\r\nwholesale traders, entered into a compact with the Canadian sugar\r\nrefiners, who agreed that dealers outside of the guild should be charged\r\n30 cents per 100 pounds more for sugar than those who were in the guild.\r\nIn November, 1887, fourteen members of the guild were expelled and were\r\ncompelled to pay the higher price. The executive committee of the guild\r\nfixed the selling price for the retail dealers. The guild was so\r\nsuccessful with sugar that it extended its operations to starch, baking\r\npowder, and tobacco, fixing prices for those goods as well. The\r\ncommittee of the Dominion Parliament, appointed to investigate the\r\nguild, reported that it was a combination obnoxious to public interest,\r\nbecause it limited competition, advanced prices, and treated with gross\r\ninjustice those in the trade who were not its members. In New York State\r\nthere are two associations of wholesale grocers which are working to\r\nprevent competition in the sugar trade. They have fixed a uniform price\r\nfor sugar, and have tried to make arrangements with the managers of the\r\nsugar trust by which that organization shall discriminate against all\r\ngrocers who are not members of the association by refusing to sell them\r\nsugar or charging them a higher price. In some other sections an attempt\r\nhas been, or is being, made by which the retail grocer sells only at\r\ncertain fixed prices determined by a committee of the wholesalers who\r\nissue each week a card of rates. It is urged in defense of the movement\r\nthat sugar has been sold at an actual loss by both the wholesale and\r\nretail trade for a very long time. The Grocers' Association, at its\r\nfirst meeting, passed a resolution declaring that it was opposed to\r\ncombinations for the purpose of extorting unreasonable profits from the\r\npublic, and that all that was sought was to prevent the evil of handling\r\ncertain staples below the cost of doing the business. But if we inquire\r\nwhy these staples have been handled at a loss, the answer is, because of\r\nthe strong competition which has prevailed. The organization, then, is a\r\ncombination to limit competition, to suppress it, in fact, and the\r\ndifference between its purpose and work and that of the Sugar Trust is a\r\ndifference of degree and not of kind. The reason for its moderate\r\ndemands may be because grocers are more liberal-hearted than refiners,\r\nor because they understand that their power over the trade is more\r\nlimited than those who control the original product, so that an attempt\r\nto exact too large profits would offer a tempting premium to competitors\r\nof the Association.\r\n\r\nAnother staple article of consumption in which combinations are known to\r\nexist is meat. It is affirmed that a combine of buyers and slaughterers\r\ncontrols the markets of Chicago and Kansas City, and both depresses the\r\nprice paid for cattle in the market, and raises the price of beef to the\r\nretail dealer. This monopoly proved so oppressive, and attracted so much\r\nattention, that in February, 1889, Gov. Humphrey of Kansas, called a\r\nconvention of delegates from the legislatures of ten different States\r\nand Territories to devise a system of legislation, to be recommended for\r\nadoption by the several States, which should destroy the power of the\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nOne of the combinations investigated by the New York State Committee\r\nappointed to investigate trusts and similar organizations, was an\r\nassociation of the retail butchers, and the brokers buying sheep, lambs,\r\ncalves, etc., from the farmers. The purpose of the association is to\r\nprevent competition among its members and keep control of prices in its\r\nown hands by charging a higher price to outsiders than to members of the\r\nassociation. The ultimate effect is to increase profits by paying less\r\nfor the animals and getting higher prices for the meat sold.\r\n\r\nWe might go on at indefinite length to examine the various monopolies of\r\nthis sort, but it does not seem necessary. The salient fact which is\r\nevident to any one at all conversant with business affairs is, that in\r\nalmost every line of trade the restriction of competition is in force to\r\na greater or less extent. Those monopolies are strongest, indeed, which\r\nhave control of production; but in so far as they can control the\r\nmarket, the men engaged in buying and selling are equally ready to\r\ncreate minor monopolies, and an acquaintance with the general markets\r\nconvinces one that these monopolies are numerous enough to have a very\r\nimportant effect in increasing the cost of goods to the consumer.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to think of competition as a force which always tends\r\nto keep prices down, and of a monopoly as always raising prices; but it\r\nshould be understood that this is true only of the competition and\r\nmonopolies among _sellers_ of goods. It must be remembered that the\r\ncompetition among _buyers_, is a force which acts in the opposite\r\ndirection and tends to raise prices; and that it is quite possible to\r\nhave combinations among buyers to restrict competition and keep prices\r\ndown. Of course, where the buyer is the final consumer, this is almost\r\nimpossible, for the great number of competitors forbids any permanent\r\ncombination. Also where the product concerned is a manufactured article\r\nor a mineral product, the mining or manufacturing company or firm will\r\ngenerally have capital enough and business ability enough to defeat any\r\nattempt of the wholesale merchants to combine to reduce the prices paid\r\nfor their output. This he can easily do by selling to retail dealers\r\ndirect. But in the case of products gathered from the farmers the case\r\nis different, and the producer can less easily protect himself against\r\ncombinations among buyers to fix the price he shall receive. The power\r\nand extent of these monopolies varies with the distance of the farmer\r\nfrom markets, and also, it must be said, with the intelligence and\r\nshrewdness of the farmer. In districts remote from railways and markets\r\nthe farmers are often dependent on the travelling buyers for a chance to\r\nsell their cattle or produce. In a thinly settled region there may be no\r\nmore than two or three times in a season when a farmer will have an\r\nopportunity to dispose of his surplus products; and, realizing his\r\nnecessity, he is apt to be beaten down to a much lower price than the\r\nbuyer would have given if other buyers had been competing with him to\r\nsecure the goods. In the chief markets, too, there is often a\r\ncombination of buyers formed to keep down prices. The combine of\r\ncattle-buyers in Kansas City and Chicago has just been noted. The New\r\nYork Legislative Committee discovered that a milk trust had control of\r\nthe supply of milk for New York City, fixing the price paid to the\r\nfarmer at three cents per quart, and the selling price at 7 or 8 cents\r\nper quart. According to the suit brought by the Attorney-General of\r\nLouisiana against the Cotton-Seed Oil Trust, that monopoly has reduced\r\nthe price paid to the planters for seed from $7 to $4 per ton. As the\r\ntotal amount of cotton seed which it purchases is about 700,000 tons a\r\nyear, it is evident that this feature of the combination alone puts into\r\nthe pockets of the owners of the Trust over two million dollars per\r\nannum, over and above the profits made through its control of the\r\ncotton-seed oil market. Evidently the combinations which lower prices by\r\nrestricting competition among purchasers are not to be overlooked\r\nbecause of unimportance.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on monopolies of mineral wealth it was stated that the\r\nFrench copper syndicate is not a \"trust,\" but a \"corner.\" It has not\r\nbeen common to consider \"corners\" as a species of monopoly, except as\r\nthey have, like the latter, acquired a bad reputation with the general\r\npublic from their effect in raising the price of the necessaries of\r\nlife. But if we look at the matter carefully, it becomes plain that the\r\naim of the maker of corners is the same exactly as that of the organizer\r\nof trusts,--to kill competition. The difference lies in the fact that\r\nthe \"corner\" is a temporary monopoly, while the trust is a permanent\r\none. The man who forms a corner in, let us say, wheat, first purchases\r\nor secures the control of the whole available supply of wheat, or as\r\nnear the whole supply as he can. In addition to this he purchases more\r\nthan is really within reach of the market, by buying \"futures,\" or\r\nmaking contracts with others who agree to deliver him wheat at some\r\nfuture time. Of course he aims to secure the greater part of his wheat\r\nquietly, at low figures; but after he deems that the supply is nearly\r\nwithin his control, he spreads the news that there is a \"corner\" in the\r\nmarket, and buys openly all the wheat he can, offering larger and larger\r\nprices, until he raises the price sufficiently high to suit him. Now the\r\nmen who have contracted to deliver wheat to him at this date are at his\r\nmercy. They must buy their wheat of him at whatever price he chooses to\r\nask, and deliver it as soon as purchased, in order to fulfil their\r\ncontracts. Meanwhile mills must be kept in operation, and the millers\r\nhave to pay an increased price for wheat; they charge the bakers a\r\nhigher price for flour, and the bakers raise the price of bread. Thus is\r\ntold by the hungry mouths in the poor man's home, the last act in the\r\ntragedy of the \"corner.\"\r\n\r\nFourier tells of an event in his early life which made a lasting\r\nimpression on him. While in the employ of a mercantile firm at\r\nMarseilles, his employers engaged in a speculation in rice. They\r\npurchased almost all the available supply and held it at high prices\r\nduring the prevalence of a famine. Some cargoes which were stored on\r\nshipboard rotted, and Fourier had to superintend the work of throwing\r\nthe wasted grain, for the want of which people had been dying like dogs,\r\ninto the sea. The \"corners\" of the present day are no less productive of\r\ndiscontent with the existing state of society than were those of\r\nFourier's time.\r\n\r\nBut, returning to our subject, it should be said that the \"corner,\"\r\ngenerally speaking, does much less injury to the public than is commonly\r\nsupposed. As we have shown, the manipulators of the corner make their\r\nchief profits from other speculators who operate on the opposing side of\r\nthe market; and it is but a small part of their gains which is taken\r\nfrom the consumers. The effect on the consumer of the abnormal rise in\r\nprice caused by the corner is sometimes quite made up for by the\r\nabnormal fall which occurs when the corner breaks. Generally, however,\r\nthe drop in prices will be slower to reach down to the final consumer,\r\npast the middlemen, than will the higher prices. The corner makers also\r\nare apt, if they are shrewd and successful, to make the total of their\r\nsales for the current supply yield them a profit. Thus suppose that the\r\nnormal price of wheat is 70 cents per bushel, and that the syndicate\r\nsecures control of five million bushels at the normal price. If while it\r\nkeeps the price up it sells two million bushels at $1.20 per bushel, it\r\ncan afford to get rid of the rest of its stock at an average price as\r\nlow even as 50 cents per bushel, and still make four hundred thousand\r\ndollars' profit.\r\n\r\nThe operations of corner makers are confined principally to goods which\r\nare dealt in upon commercial exchanges. One evident reason for this is\r\nthat the vast purchases and sales, which are necessary in the formation\r\nof a corner are impossible without the facilities afforded by an\r\nexchange. It must be said, too, that the plain truth is that our\r\nprincipal commercial exchanges, while they do serve certain useful\r\npurposes, are yet practically devoted chiefly to speculation. This,\r\nsimmered down to its essence, means that the business of the speculators\r\nis to bet on the future prices of the articles dealt in,--a game in\r\nwhich the largest players are able to influence prices to accord with\r\ntheir bets, and hence have their \"lamb\" opponents at an obvious\r\ndisadvantage. The evil of this sort of commercial gambling is recognized\r\nby practical men of every class; but its cure is yet to be effected.\r\n\r\nA sort of business allied both to trade and transportation is the\r\nbusiness of storage or warehousing, and this has recently shown some\r\ninteresting cases of monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe owners of warehouses along the Brooklyn waterfront combined their\r\nbusiness in January, 1888, and doubled their rates for storage. In the\r\ntestimony of one of the members of this trust, before the New York\r\nLegislative Committee, he said: \"We want to destroy competition all we\r\ncan. It is a bad thing.\" The owners of grain elevators at Buffalo, N.\r\nY., have long combined to exact higher prices for the transfer of grain\r\nthan would have prevailed were free competition the rule. At the session\r\nof 1887 the New York Legislature took the bull by the horns and enacted\r\na law fixing a maximum rate for elevator charges; a statute which was\r\nbased on the popular demand for its enactment, but is hard to accord\r\nwith the principles of a free government.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of lines of business auxiliary to trade in which\r\ncompetition is more or less restricted by the fact that the amount of\r\ncapital controlled and the prestige of the established firms renders it\r\na difficult and risky matter to start a new and competing firm. The\r\ninsurer of property or life, if he be wise, will demand financial\r\nstability as a first requisite for the company in which he takes a\r\npolicy. The companies engaged in the business of fire insurance have\r\nlong been trying to agree on some uniform standard of rates and the\r\navoidance of all competition with each other. These combinations,\r\nhowever, are apt to be broken, as soon as formed, by the weaker\r\ncompanies, whose financial condition operates to prevent them from\r\ngetting their share of the business under uniform rates. Even when this\r\nrate-cutting is stopped, there is still competition to be met from the\r\nvarious small mutual companies, who are necessarily outside the\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nBanks are a necessity to the carrying on of modern commerce, and they\r\nhave great power over the financial affairs of the business men of the\r\ncommunity which they serve. As a general rule, however, they are\r\nlargely owned by the merchants and others who patronize them, and the\r\ninstances of this power being abused are, therefore, not common. It is\r\nto be remembered, in discussing this, as in other monopolies, that the\r\npower of a monopoly depends entirely upon its degree. A bank, trust\r\ncompany, or real-estate guaranty company which has a great capital, an\r\nestablished reputation for safety and conservatism, sole control of many\r\nspecial facilities, and conveniences for obtaining and dispatching\r\nbusiness, has a real monopoly, whose degree varies with the tendency\r\npeople have to patronize it instead of some weaker competitor, if one\r\nexists. There is no evil effect from the monopoly upon the community,\r\nunless it takes advantage of its power to charge a sum greater than\r\ntheir real worth for the services it renders, or uses it to discriminate\r\nto the injury of special persons or places.\r\n\r\nIn closing our discussion of the monopolies in trade, there is an\r\nimportant point to be noted. In the lines of industry considered in the\r\npreceding chapter, the monopoly was easy of maintenance because it held\r\nfull control of the source of production, or of some necessary channel\r\nthrough which commerce must pass. No gift of nature assists to maintain\r\na monopoly in trade. It must be wholly artificial, and it relies for its\r\nstrength simply on the adherence of its members to their agreement to\r\nmaintain prices. Its degree of power can never be great, compared with\r\nmonopolies which control the original sources of production; for if it\r\nis attempted to put up prices inordinately, competition will start up\r\noutside of the combination, or the consumer will be led to deal directly\r\nwith the producer.\r\n\r\nBecause of this weakness, the temptation is great for these monopolies\r\nto strengthen themselves in ways quite indefensible on any score. The\r\nalliance of trade monopolies with trusts, in order to strengthen\r\nthemselves, we have already considered. But the trust which makes such\r\nan alliance must plead guilty to the charge of _discrimination_ as well\r\nas _monopoly_. It is bad enough to raise the prices of the necessaries\r\nof life, and force the whole community to pay the tax; but it is worse\r\nto add to this the crime of discrimination against certain persons in\r\nthe community, at the instance of a minor monopoly.\r\n\r\nBut the trade monopoly does not confine its sins to tempting the\r\nstronger monopoly to practise discriminations. It practises\r\ndiscrimination itself in some very ugly forms. A combination among\r\nmanufacturers of railway car-springs, which wished to ruin an\r\nindependent competitor, not only agreed with the American Steel\r\nAssociation that the independent company should be charged $10 per ton\r\nmore for steel than the members of the combine, but raised a fund to be\r\nused as follows: When the independent company made a bid on a contract\r\nfor springs, one of the members of the trust was authorized to underbid\r\nat a price which would incur a loss, which was to be paid for out of the\r\nfund. In this way the competing company was to be driven out of\r\nbusiness. It is often argued that combinations to advance prices can\r\nnever exist long, because of the premium which the advanced price puts\r\nupon the entrance to the field of new competitors; but the weapons which\r\nthis trust used to ruin an old and strong competitor are even more\r\neffectual against a new-comer; and the knowledge that they are to meet\r\nsuch a warfare is apt to deter new competitors from entering the field.\r\n\r\nThe boycott was once deemed rather a degrading weapon of warfare; but\r\nnow the term has grown to be a familiar one in trade circles. Even the\r\ngreat railway companies do not scruple to use the boycott in fighting\r\ntheir battles. One might imagine that both the thing and the name filled\r\na long felt want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLIES DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact has been already referred to that the principal monopolies\r\nwhich existed previous to the present century were those created by\r\ngovernment. In the days when governments were less strong than now, and\r\nless able to raise money by such taxes as they chose to assess, it was a\r\nvery convenient way to replenish the king's exchequer to sell the\r\nmonopoly of a certain trade to some rich merchant. Nor was the\r\nestablishment of these monopolies entirely without just reason. In those\r\ndays of scarce and timid capital, inducements had to be held out to\r\nencourage the establishment of new enterprises. An instance of this,\r\nfamiliar to every one, was the grant to the owners of the first\r\nsteamboat of the sole right to navigate the Hudson River by steam for a\r\nterm of years. In the early history of the nation and in colonial days,\r\ngovernment grants to establish local monopolies were very common. In\r\nthis, however, we only followed the example of the mother country, which\r\nhad long granted limited monopolies in trade and transportation as a\r\nmeans of encouraging new enterprises and the investment of capital.\r\n\r\nThe monopolies of the present day which are properly considered as\r\ngovernment monopolies are of two classes. The essential principle on\r\nwhich all are based is that their establishment is for the common\r\nbenefit, real or supposed; but the first class--to which belong the\r\npatents and copyrights--are also justified on the ground that the brain\r\nworker should be protected in his right to reap the just profits from\r\nhis labor.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a copyright is simply to make it possible for an author to\r\nreceive some recompense from his work. He can only do this by selling it\r\nin printed form to those who may wish to buy; but if there were no\r\ncopyright, any printer might sell duplicates of the book as soon as it\r\nwas issued, and could sell them at a much less price than the original\r\nedition, as the book would have cost him nothing to prepare. The\r\npractical result would thus be that few could afford to spend study and\r\nresearch in writing books, and the volumes which would be printed would\r\nbe apt to be only those of so cheap and worthless a sort that no one\r\nwould take the trouble to copy them. The monopoly produced by a\r\ncopyright takes nothing from the public which it previously enjoyed. The\r\nwriter of a book creates something which did not before exist; and if\r\npeople do not wish to buy that which he has created, they are at perfect\r\nliberty not to do so. The monopoly relates only to the production and\r\nsale of that particular book. Others are at liberty to write similar\r\nbooks upon the same subject, which will compete with the first; and the\r\nsame information may be given in different words without infringing the\r\ncopyright.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear enough, then, that the monopoly which occurs in the use\r\nof a copyright, is of an entirely different sort from the monopolies\r\nwhich we have previously considered. Competition is not destroyed by it,\r\nand its only effect upon the public relates to an entirely new\r\nproduction, which is not a necessity, and which the public could not\r\nhave had an opportunity to enjoy if the copyright law had not made it\r\npossible for the author to write the book with the prospect of being\r\nrepaid for his labor by the sale of the printed volume.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the granting of patents is based on the same\r\nprinciple as the granting of copyrights. A clause of the Constitution\r\nempowers the general government to grant to authors and inventors for\r\nlimited periods the exclusive right to their respective writings and\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nIf we judge the granting of patents by the aims and intentions which are\r\nheld in the theory of the law, we must conclude that it is a highly\r\nwise, just, and beneficial act. The man who invents a new machine or\r\ndevice which benefits the public by making easier or cheaper some\r\nindustrial operation, performs a valuable service to the world. But he\r\ncan receive no reward for this service, if any one is at liberty to make\r\nand sell the new machine he has invented; and unless the patent laws\r\ngave him the power to repay himself for the labor and expense of\r\nplanning and designing his new device, it is altogether probable that he\r\nwould not spend his time in inventing.\r\n\r\nThe wealth which a valuable patent promises has been a great incentive\r\nto the work of inventors, and has undoubtedly been a chief cause of the\r\ngreat mechanical advancement of the last half century. But the state of\r\nmechanical science has greatly changed from what it was when the clause\r\nof the Constitution was penned which speaks of inventions as\r\n\"discoveries.\" The trained mechanical designer now perfects a machine to\r\ndo a given work, with almost the same certainty that it will be\r\nsuccessful in its operation that he would feel if the machine were an\r\nold and familiar one. The successful inventor is no longer an alchemist\r\ngroping in the dark. His task is simply to accomplish certain results\r\nwith certain known means at his disposal and certain well-understood\r\nscientific principles to guide him in his work. But this statement, too,\r\nmust be qualified. There are still inventions made which are the result\r\nof a happy inspiration as well as of direct design. Not all the\r\nprinciples of mechanical science and the modes of reaching desired ends\r\nare yet known or appreciated by even the best mechanical engineers.\r\nThere is still room for inventors whose rights should be protected. The\r\ninterpreters of our patent laws have always held the theory that the use\r\nof a natural agent or principle could not be the subject of a patent.\r\nThis is undoubtedly wise and just. The distinction should always be\r\nsharply drawn between those existing forces of nature which are as truly\r\ncommon property as air and sunlight, and the tool or device invented to\r\naid in their use.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a notorious fact that the great multiplicity of inventions\r\nhas made the search to determine the novelty of any article submitted\r\nfor a patent for the most part a farce. No one is competent nowadays to\r\nsay surely of any ordinary mechanical device that it is absolutely new.\r\nThe bulky volumes of Patent-Office reports are for the most part a\r\nhodge-podge of crude ideas, repeated over and over again under different\r\nnames, with just enough valuable matter, in the shape of the inventions\r\nof practical mechanical designers and educated inventors, to save the\r\nvolumes from being an entire waste of paper and ink. Space, however,\r\nwill not permit us to discuss at length the faults of our patent system.\r\nThe important point for us to notice is that the patent system\r\nestablishes certain monopolies, and that these monopolies are not\r\nalways harmless. Patents are given to \"promote the useful arts,\" but the\r\ninventor whom they are supposed to encourage reaps but a small share of\r\nthe profits of his inventions. Valuable improvements soon fall into the\r\nhands of large companies, who are able to defend them in the courts, and\r\nreap all possible profits by their use.\r\n\r\nAgain, patents sometimes aid in the formation of trusts and\r\ncombinations. Two or three firms may control all the valuable patents in\r\nconnection with some important industry. If they agree to combine their\r\ninterests and work in harmony, they are far stronger than an ordinary\r\ntrust, because the patents they hold prevent outside competition. It was\r\npointed out in the opening chapter how the control of patents was\r\nsometimes a feature helping to induce the formation of trusts. The\r\nStandard Oil Trust had its origin in the superiority which one firm\r\ngained over its competitors through the control of an important patent.\r\nThe envelope trust, which, at this date, has raised the price of\r\nenvelopes about twenty per cent., owes its chief strength to its control\r\nof patents on the machines for making the envelopes. Instances\r\ninnumerable could be given where a few manufacturers, who by their\r\nownership of patents controlled the whole field, have ended a fierce\r\ncompetition by consolidating or agreeing to work together harmoniously\r\nin the matter of selling-prices. Very many of these are monopolies in\r\ntrade or monopolies in manufacturing, and as such have already been\r\nconsidered in the preceding chapters; but it is proper here to point out\r\nthe part which our patent system has taken in their formation, and the\r\nfact that it is due to their control of patents that many of the\r\nexisting combinations owe their security against outside competition.\r\n\r\nProbably the public was never so forcibly reminded of the defects of our\r\npatent system by any other means as it has been by the operation of the\r\nBell Telephone monopoly. The purpose in granting patents is to aid in\r\nthe establishment of new lines of industrial activity, secure to the\r\ninventor the right to reap a reward for his work, and encourage other\r\ninventors to persevere in their search for new improvements. All these\r\nthings are effected by the monopoly which is held by the Bell Telephone\r\nCompany; but they are effected at a cost to the users of the telephone\r\nunder which they have grown very restive. Passing by the statement that\r\nthe patents which the Bell company holds were illegally procured in the\r\nfirst place, through the inventor having had access to the secret\r\nrecords in the Patent Office of other inventions for which a patent had\r\nbeen asked at about the same time as his own, it is an undisputed fact\r\nthat the Bell company holds the monopoly of communication by electric\r\ntelephone in this country. They have managed this monopoly with great\r\nskill. While the instrument was yet in its introductory stage, and when\r\nevery smart town felt obliged to start a telephone exchange or fall\r\nbehind the times, prices were kept low; but when once the telephone\r\nbecame a business necessity and its benefits were well known, rates of\r\nrental were advanced to the point where the greatest possible profits\r\nwould accrue to the Bell company's stockholders. This was excellent\r\ngeneralship. The same principle is applied in many other lines of\r\nbusiness; and it was only because the company held a monopoly of a most\r\nvaluable industry, that it proved so immensely profitable here. But\r\nother acts of the company, it is alleged, while within the letter of\r\nthe law, are yet clearly infringements on the just rights of the public.\r\nIt is charged that the company has purposely refrained from putting into\r\npractical use any of the many improvements which have been made in the\r\ntelephone during the past few years, but at the same time has quietly\r\nsecured their control. By skilfully managing \"interferences\" of one\r\npatent against another, and by amending and altering the various\r\nspecifications, it contrives to delay as long as possible the issue of\r\nthe patents upon these inventions. By means of these improvements, which\r\nit purposes to introduce as its present patents expire, it proposes to\r\ncontinue its monopoly for many years to come. It is very likely that\r\nthis attempt will succeed.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the folly of establishing competing electric light\r\ncompanies, and the attempt to establish rival telephone exchanges is\r\njust as sure to result ultimately in a heavy additional tax on the\r\npublic. Then, too, the monopoly has grown so wealthy and powerful\r\nthrough its enormous profits that it will be very loth to release its\r\nhold, even when it is no longer protected by patents. Rival companies\r\nwhich may be established then, it will seek to crush by a fierce\r\ncompetition; and it will be quite likely to succeed. But in so far as it\r\nis not protected by patents, it is properly to be considered with other\r\nmunicipal monopolies, in which class we have already referred to it.\r\n\r\nThe course pursued by the Bell Telephone Company has at least proved\r\nthat our whole patent system demands a thorough and radical revision.\r\nThe inventor should certainly be protected, but not to the public hurt.\r\n\r\nThe second class of monopolies which the government establishes or aids\r\nin establishing because it is deemed to be for the public welfare that\r\nthey exist, are, first, those private industries which receive aid from\r\nthe government, either directly by subsidies or indirectly by the\r\ntaxation of the goods of foreign competitors; and second, those branches\r\nof industry which are carried on by the government itself.\r\n\r\nThe question concerning the granting of subsidies is principally a past\r\nissue. A century ago many new enterprises in all lines of industry\r\nlooked to the government for aid. In those days, when capital was scarce\r\nand when investors hesitated at risk, it was perhaps wise to grant the\r\nhelp of the public treasury to aid the establishment of young\r\nindustries; but nowadays, when millions of capital are ready to seize\r\nevery opportunity for profitable investment, it is recognized that\r\nsubsidies by the general government are no longer needed. The days of\r\nsubsidy granting ended none too soon. The people of the United States\r\ngave away millions of acres of their fertile lands and other millions of\r\nhard-earned dollars to aid in the building of the railroad lines of the\r\nWest; and a great part of the wealth thus lavished has been gathered\r\ninto the coffers of a few dozen men. The monopolies created by these\r\nsubsidies have been largely shorn of their power; but while they reigned\r\nsupreme, their profits were gathered with no halting hand.\r\n\r\nThere is only one direction in which we still hear the granting of\r\nsubsidies by the general government strongly advocated; that is in the\r\ndirection of establishing steamship lines to foreign ports. It would be\r\napart from the scope of our subject to discuss the wisdom or folly of\r\nsuch a proceeding farther than to note the fact that it establishes a\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nTake, let us say, the case of a steamer line between New York and Buenos\r\nAyres. It is plain in the first place that the government aid will only\r\nbe granted if there is not business enough to induce private parties to\r\ntake up the enterprise. But as we suppose that there was not business\r\nenough in the first place to support one steamer line unaided, it is\r\ncertain that none will undertake to establish a rival line to compete\r\nwith that already sure of profits by reason of the government aid. Hence\r\nthis line will have a monopoly of the trade; and unless some proper\r\nrestrictions as to rates accompany the subsidy, the monopoly may lay an\r\nextortionate tax on the public who patronize it.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the tariff to monopolies is one which deserves the\r\ncareful attention of every thinking man. Let us, in discussing this\r\nquestion, lay aside all prejudice and preconceived ideas for or against\r\nthe protective tariff system and consider candidly what are the actual\r\nfacts of the case. It is evident, in the first place, that the purpose\r\nof the tariff tax which the government levies on goods imported from\r\nabroad is to _keep out foreign competition from our markets_. The\r\nimported goods cost more by the amount of the tariff than they otherwise\r\nwould; and the American producer, if he makes equally desirable goods\r\nand does not raise his selling price above that at which imported goods\r\ncan be bought, is secure against foreign competition. But we have\r\nalready learned that monopoly is simply the absence of competition; and\r\ninasmuch as the tariff checks or shuts out foreign competition, it has a\r\n_tendency_ toward the establishment of monopoly. But this tendency may\r\nnot result in the establishment of any monopoly. There is a tariff on\r\npotatoes, but there is no monopoly in their production. Evidently the\r\ntariff cannot create a monopoly; it only makes its establishment more\r\neasy by narrowing the field of competition to the producers of this\r\nsingle country. If we turn back over the list of monopolies we have\r\nstudied, to find those which the tariff has any effect in aiding to\r\nestablish, we shall find none till we reach the first two chapters. The\r\nmonopolies in mineral products and manufactured goods, known generally\r\nby the name of trusts, it is self-evident are largely dependent upon the\r\ntariff. If they raise their price above a certain point, people will buy\r\ngoods of foreign production instead. This point--the price at which\r\nforeign goods can be profitably sold--depends on the rate of the tariff,\r\non the cost of production in foreign countries, and the cost of their\r\ncarriage here.\r\n\r\nOf the various trusts, it is evident that only those would be effected\r\nby the removal or reduction of the tariff whose products are now covered\r\nby it. Thus the Standard Oil Trust and the Cotton-Seed Oil Trust would\r\nnot be injured by any reduction in the tariff. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, nearly all of the trusts have to do with manufactured goods\r\nwhich are covered by the tariff, and the two exceptions already named\r\nare about the only ones.\r\n\r\nThe trusts in manufactured products, broadly speaking, then, are all\r\ndependent on the tariff. Here is a strange condition of affairs. In the\r\nearly history of this nation, the people of this country, represented by\r\ntheir popular government, were appealed to by the men engaged in\r\nmanufacturing after this fashion: \"We cannot make the things you need as\r\ncheaply as the manufacturers in foreign countries. They are wealthy and\r\nwe are poor. They have their mills already in operation, we have ours to\r\nbuild. The capital we borrow bears a rate of interest double that which\r\nthe foreign mill-owner has to pay. The labor we must employ is not yet\r\ntrained as is theirs, and it must receive far higher wages. Therefore we\r\nask that you aid us in establishing our industries by paying us higher\r\nprices for our goods than those for which you could purchase the same\r\ngoods of foreign manufacture. In order that every one shall be obliged\r\nto do this, and that all may contribute equally to our support, we ask\r\nyou to pass laws laying a tax on all imported goods which compete with\r\nours, whereby none shall be able to buy them at a cheaper price than we\r\ncan afford to sell our own goods.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the people replied: \"While we recognize the fact that we must pay an\r\nincreased price for your goods compared with that which is asked for\r\ngoods from foreign mills, and are thus taxing ourselves for your\r\nbenefit, yet we see how desirable it is that our industries should be\r\ndiversified and that we should not be dependent on foreign nations for\r\nthe necessaries and comforts of life. Thus _for a season_ we will grant\r\nyour petition and tax ourselves to establish you in your business.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the spirit of the movement that inaugurated the protective\r\ntariff. One other great argument for its establishment, which was\r\nbelieved by the people and was assented to by the manufacturers, was as\r\nfollows: \"Our natural advantages for engaging in manufacturing are\r\nbeyond those of any other nation. Our workmen are more skillful,\r\nintelligent, and ingenious; our capitalists are more enterprising. At\r\nthe same time there are many difficulties to be overcome in establishing\r\na manufacturing business in a new country. Some assistance is needed at\r\nthe outset to tide it past the critical period. Now, if we can give our\r\nmanufacturers a start and enable them to establish themselves, they\r\nwill improve all these natural advantages which we possess; and with the\r\nabundance of raw material in our mines and farms and forests, with our\r\ningenuity and Yankee enterprise and skill, who can doubt that our\r\nmanufacturers, once established, can produce goods more cheaply than\r\nthey could ever be brought across from foreign countries? This\r\nprotection from foreign competition will be a great incentive to the\r\nestablishment of manufacturing enterprises. Everywhere mills and\r\nfactories will spring up; a brisk home competition will be created; and\r\nthat will finally reduce prices lower than they could ever go if we\r\nremained dependent on foreign countries for our manufactured goods.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a wise and well-founded plan, and only as to its final result did\r\nit fail. The protective tariff did make manufacturing more profitable\r\nthan any other business, and mills and factories of every sort have\r\nsprung up in all parts of the country. But the expected extreme\r\ncompetition which was to reduce manufacturers' profits and the price of\r\nmanufactured goods to a basis in accordance with the profits in\r\nagricultural and other branches of industry has been long delayed. The\r\nwonderful development of the country has kept up prices and profits, and\r\nhas furnished a market for our manufacturers which has long kept in\r\nadvance of their capacity to supply it. At last, however, the result\r\nwhich was expected by the founders of the protective tariff has come to\r\npass. Our domestic mills and factories have a capacity beyond the\r\npresent demand for their products. The home competition which was\r\npredicted has come; and if it had operated to reduce prices as was\r\nexpected, there would now be employment for all our mills, for it is an\r\naxiom that every reduction in price increases the demand.\r\n\r\nBut the manufacturers who had been making enormous profits of ten,\r\ntwenty, and thirty per cent. on their capital for these many years, were\r\nfar from willing to accept calmly the situation and reduce their profits\r\nto a reasonable figure. They have tried combinations of many sorts to\r\nkeep up prices, and at last have found in the trust a strong and\r\neffective means of killing home competition and keeping up their\r\nprofits, if they choose, to the highest point which the tariff permits.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be argued that the manufacturers were especially worse than\r\nthe general run of men in taking this action. It is the most natural\r\nthing in the world that a man who has all his life been used to making\r\nenormous profits in his business should come to think that he had an\r\ninalienable right to make them; and that when competition became so\r\nsharp that he had to lower his prices, it was due to an unnatural\r\ncondition of affairs glibly designated as \"over-production,\" for which\r\nthe trust was an appropriate and wise remedy.\r\n\r\nIt is thus plain how, in a secondary way, the tariff is a cause of the\r\ntrusts. The fat profits which the former gave have made men covetous\r\nenough to engage in the latter.\r\n\r\nWe are, perhaps, not yet prepared to discuss the question of the proper\r\nremedies for trusts; but it is too obvious to call for comment that an\r\neasy and most effective remedy is to cut away the protection from\r\nforeign competition, under which they flourish, and let them sink or\r\nswim as they best can. At the least it will be wise to reduce their\r\nprotection to a point where any attempt to tax the nation of consumers\r\nand reap exorbitant profits by putting up prices so that profits of\r\ntwenty-five per cent. or more can be reaped, will be counteracted by\r\nforeign competition.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to point out at the same time that this remedy is far\r\nfrom being a panacea against all trusts and monopolies. The monopolies\r\nin the peculiar products of this country will be unaffected by it, and\r\nthe combinations which embrace the whole globe in their plan of\r\noperations are quite beyond its power. The copper syndicate and the salt\r\ntrust, and according to Mr. Carnegie a steel rail trust, are the only\r\nactual examples of international combinations which have ever been\r\nattempted, and it will probably be many years yet before the constant\r\nmovement towards Tennyson's \"Federation of the World\" permits the\r\ngeneral formation of effective industrial combinations which shall\r\nembrace all commercial nations.\r\n\r\nWe have finally to consider the monopolies carried on directly by the\r\ngovernment. The carriage of the mails is the most important monopoly\r\ncarried on by the government, and we may find some facts of interest by\r\nenquiring the reasons why it is for the public welfare that it should be\r\nso conducted rather than by private enterprise. In the first place, if\r\nit were left to private enterprise to furnish us with postal facilities,\r\nthe postal service would be much more limited than now; many places of\r\nsmall importance being left without postal facilities or charged a much\r\nhigher rate for service than now. On the other hand--and this is an\r\nimportant point--there would, perhaps, be in and between the large\r\ncities competition between different companies; in which case there\r\nwould be duplicate sets of postal facilities, including buildings,\r\nmail-boxes, furniture, and employees of every grade. It is plain that\r\nall this would be a waste. One set of facilities is better for the\r\npublic than two or three or more, and is ample to carry all the mails.\r\nTo put another set of men at the work that others are already able to\r\ndo, is to waste just so much of the working force of the world, as well\r\nas the capital necessary to furnish tools and buildings for its use. The\r\nmatter of rates, too, would vary with the competition. One could never\r\nbe sure what his postage bill for the coming year was to be. The\r\nreceipts of the companies would be uncertain, and they would be obliged\r\nto pay a high rate of interest on the capital invested in their plant,\r\nthus making it necessary for them to charge high rates for their\r\nservice. The intense competition between rival companies would lead to\r\nthe bankruptcy of the weaker, and the final result would be the\r\nestablishment of a single corporation in the control of the whole\r\nsystem. Rates would then be put up to the point where the greatest\r\nprofit would accrue to the corporation.\r\n\r\nUnder the existing system, then, we save in cost of service over\r\ncompeting systems under private direction, in that the existing\r\nfacilities are all made use of. There is no waste by setting two men to\r\ndo the work of one, or by renting two offices to do the business which\r\none could accommodate, neither is any energy wasted in soliciting\r\nbusiness. The capital invested by the government in its plant for\r\ncarrying on the postal service would bear interest, if the money were\r\nborrowed, of not more than two or three per cent. But if a private\r\ncompany borrowed money to carry a similar business, they would have to\r\npay five to seven per cent., which they would have to make up for by\r\ncharging a higher rate of postage.\r\n\r\nOther monopolies which have been carried on by the government are the\r\nbusiness of transportation, and the provision of roads, bridges, and\r\ncanals therefor; monopolies in mining; and in the case of municipal\r\ngovernments, as already noted, the supply of water, gas, and electric\r\nservice, and street railway transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLIES IN THE LABOR MARKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be said at the outset of this chapter that, in a very true\r\nsense, practically all men are laborers. That into which a man puts his\r\nenergy and by which he earns his living, is his labor, whether it be\r\nwork of the hand or the head. But the labor we are to consider in this\r\nchapter is that of the men who work for wages; and we will also make the\r\narbitrary distinction that it is that of the men who work for wages in\r\nsome branch of manufacturing, mining, trade, or transportation, the\r\ngreat divisions of modern industry which we have thus far considered.\r\n\r\nAlmost all these monopolies employ large amounts of capital in carrying\r\non their business; and in the popular speech, \"monopolist\" and\r\n\"capitalist\" are often used interchangeably. It is a very common belief\r\nthat monopolies are confined to the capitalized industries of\r\nproduction, transportation, and trade, which we have already considered;\r\nbut we are now confronted by the fact that the wage-workers in the\r\nvarious trades of the country are engaged in exactly the same\r\nmonopolistic schemes, in which they have exactly the same ends in view\r\nas have the monopolists who combine millions of dollars' worth of\r\ncapital to effect their purposes. On the one hand we have the Standard\r\nOil Trust and the Railroad pools and the hundreds of other capitalistic\r\ncombinations striving to benefit the producer at the expense of the\r\nconsumer; while among those whose only capital is their strength and\r\nskill, we find the workers in all the various trades, and even some of\r\nthe lower grades of laborers firmly banded together with the avowed\r\npurpose of raising their wages above those which they would receive if\r\ncompetition alone determined the rate. And they are successful, too.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that they deal with tens of thousands of\r\nproducing units where the combiner of capitalized interests deals with\r\ntens, the success achieved by the combinations of labor is quite\r\ncomparable with that reached by combinations of capital. It speaks\r\nvolumes for the intelligence and ability of the wage-workers of the\r\npresent day--yes, and for the growth of the spirit of fraternity; that\r\nin the advancement of what they deem a just and righteous cause, they\r\nshould voluntarily put themselves under discipline and endure patiently\r\nthe untold hardships of uncounted strikes, often brought on in the\r\nunselfish work of aiding their brother laborers against what they deem a\r\ncommon enemy.\r\n\r\nThe modes in which the combinations of skilled laborers attain their\r\ndesired ends are akin to those which obtain in a well organized\r\nmanufacturers' trust. The former allow only a certain number of\r\napprentices to learn their trade. The latter permit the establishment of\r\nonly such additional mills as shall not unduly increase the market\r\nsupply. The former fix a standard scale of wages below which no member\r\nof the union shall work; the latter fix a minimum price for the goods\r\nsold in the market. If there are more laborers in the union than can be\r\nemployed at the advanced rate of wages, some must be idle. If there are\r\nmore mills in the trust than the lessened demand for the goods will keep\r\nbusy, some must be shut down. The trade-union boycotts competing workmen\r\noutside its ranks, and stigmatizes them as \"scabs.\" The trusts endeavor\r\nto punish every outside manufacturer, sometimes by forcing upon him such\r\na competition as shall cause his ruin; sometimes by means as illegal and\r\ncriminal as are the riotous acts of a mob of hungry workmen, and far\r\nless defensible. But let us not yet bring up the question of relative\r\nblame. The main point which must impress every candid observer is that\r\nthe means employed for the monopolies of capital and the monopolies of\r\nlabor are identical in principle and motive. Nor are we confined to\r\nmanufacturers' trusts to show that the spirit of rule or ruin\r\ncharacterizes capital as well as labor. Railroad monopolies, in the\r\nwords of the president of one of the greatest corporations of the\r\ncountry, \"strive eagerly to protect themselves while entirely\r\nindifferent as to what shall befall their rivals.\" How many weak\r\ncorporations have been deliberately ruined by the cut rates of stronger\r\ncompetitors? If the laborer has \"scab\" in his vocabulary, has not the\r\nrailroad manager his \"scalper\" and \"guerilla\"?\r\n\r\nThe close relationship, viewed in many different aspects, of the\r\nmonopolies of labor and the monopolies in production generally has\r\nhardly received the notice its importance deserves. Still, it is an\r\nevidence that people are thinking of and discussing the matter when such\r\na writer as W. D. Howells, who is popularly supposed to cater to the\r\ntastes of those who have very little in common with the laboring\r\nclasses, puts into the mouth of one of his characters a defence of\r\nworkingmen for executing a boycott on a non-union workingman, on the\r\nground that they \"did only once just what the big manufacturing trusts\r\ndo every day.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was never so forcibly realized how thoroughly effective these\r\nlabor combinations have become, and how completely they hold the country\r\nat their mercy, as in the strike of the locomotive engineers on the\r\nChicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad system in March, 1888. Here\r\nwere, perhaps two thirds of the men in the country qualified for the\r\nresponsible and onerous work of running a locomotive engine, firmly\r\nbanded together to advance their own interests and secure assent to\r\ntheir demands. Granted the will, the courage, the discipline, and it was\r\npossible, yes, easy, for them to have obliged the railroads to raise the\r\nwages of every engineer in the brotherhood to $10.00 per day, for on a\r\nrefusal they could have enforced the extreme penalty of bringing down a\r\ntotal paralysis upon the business of the country. It speaks volumes for\r\nthe good sense, the honesty and moderation of the men and their leaders,\r\nthat, notwithstanding the fact that their demands were not immoderate,\r\nand that the failure which came permanently deprived of a remunerative\r\nposition a thousand members of their brotherhood, they refrained from\r\nthe extreme to which they might easily have gone, and permitted\r\nthemselves to be defeated, when they had the power to have forced a\r\ndifferent result.\r\n\r\nOrganized workers in many trades have the power to force wages much\r\nhigher than they have done. Would that the Sugar Refineries Company, and\r\nsome other monopolies of production, were as moderate in their demands\r\nupon the public as are the workingmen. But though their demands are in\r\none sense moderate, it is yet true that in so far as they exceed the\r\namount which the laborer would receive when the market for labor is\r\nopen to free competition, they are the direct result of the artificial\r\nmonopoly which the laborers have created by their combination, and, in\r\neffect, levy a tax upon the community. To illustrate: let us suppose\r\nthat if every man were permitted to follow the trade of bricklaying who\r\nwished to do so, the equilibrium between supply and demand would be\r\nfound at a rate of wages of $3.00 per day. At that rate, if the price\r\nrose, more men would wish to follow the trade and at the same time less\r\npeople could afford to build houses, thus raising the supply above the\r\ndemand. If the price fell, some of the men would prefer to work at some\r\nother trade and more people would conclude they could afford to build\r\nhouses. But when the rate, which, without prejudice, we call the natural\r\nrate, is at $3.00 per day, suppose the men belonging to the trade form a\r\nunion and resolve to charge $5.00 a day for their work. Then it is very\r\nevident that the cost of building is increased, and every one has to pay\r\nmore for construction and ask a higher rent to repay himself afterward.\r\nEvidently, then, by this action of the bricklayers every man in the\r\ntrade receives $2.00 more per day for each day's work, which must be\r\npaid, directly by their employers, but indirectly by the whole\r\ncommunity. It would be easy to prove that the tax on the community when\r\nthe wages are raised in any trade, affects the whole public as well as\r\nthose directly employing the workers in that trade; but it seems too\r\nplain to require proof. The main point we now wish to show, is that any\r\nincrease in the wages of labor over that received under ordinary\r\ncompetition must be paid by the community, just as much as any increase\r\nin the price of coal, iron, copper, wood, wheat, or any other commodity\r\nmust be paid by consumers at large. Nor does the injury to the\r\ncommunity stop here, by any means. We saw that the advance of prices by\r\nthe linseed oil trust was an injury to all those who, on that account,\r\nwere obliged to forego painting; and that it thus caused a further\r\ninjury to painters, paint-makers, and even those employed in the\r\nbuilding trade. But the increase in the price of the bricklayers' work\r\nhas results no less important. Not only is injury done to those who\r\nbuild and have to pay more for their buildings, but many are prevented\r\nfrom building on account of the increased cost. If we argue according to\r\na prevalent method, we may say that this reduced activity in the\r\nbuilding trade will cause stagnation among allied trades with\r\ncorresponding loss of employment. Again, as a less number of houses are\r\nbuilt, and those which are built are more expensive, rents are certain\r\nto rise, which means that the poor man must pay out a still greater part\r\nof his earnings for his shelter, or else must put up with poorer and\r\nmeaner quarters.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange thing to trace, in connection with this, the history of\r\nlabor, and see how recent it is that the natural right of a man to sell\r\nhis services for such a price as he could obtain has been acknowledged.\r\nHistory shows that until modern times, compulsory personal servitude has\r\nbeen in every age and country the lot of a large part of the human race.\r\nAnd when wages began to be paid for service, conditions were not much\r\nimproved. In England, in the fourteenth century, in the reign of Edward\r\nIII., a pestilence seriously depopulated the country, and reduced the\r\nsupply of laborers so much that it was not equal to the demand for\r\nlabor, and wages began to rise. Laws were therefore enacted that each\r\nable-bodied man and woman in the realm, not over three score, \"not\r\nliving in merchandise, nor exercising any craft, nor having of his own\r\nwhereof to live, nor land about whose tillage he might employ himself,\r\nnor serving any other,\" should be bound to serve at the wages accustomed\r\nto be given five years previously. No persons were allowed to pay an\r\nadvance on these wages, on pain of forfeiting to the Crown double what\r\nthey had paid. Previous to the fifteenth century, workmen in various\r\noccupations were impressed into the service of the king at wages\r\nregardless of their will as to the terms and place of employment.\r\nIndeed, all through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there were\r\ncontinual attempts to fix the rate of wages arbitrarily by law, and also\r\nthe hours of labor. These, by one old statute, were decreed to last from\r\n5 A.M. to 7 or 8 P.M.\r\n\r\nThese acts, and others of similar nature, were intended for the\r\nsubjugation of laborers and the benefit of the employers of labor. It is\r\nonly since the era of popular government that legislation for an\r\nopposite purpose has come in vogue. Gradually the right of the\r\nworkingman to have the price of his labor fixed as is the price of other\r\ncommodities, by the law of supply and demand, came to be recognized,\r\nalthough the progress was pitifully slow. The old ideas of the relation\r\nbetween \"master\" and \"servant\" were very tenacious of life, and the\r\nsubstitution of the terms \"workman\" and \"employer\" is a change which has\r\ntaken place in England during the present generation.\r\n\r\nIt was the petty tyranny and the grinding extortion which the laborers\r\nhad begun to feel, even though they were far better paid and better\r\ntreated than their fathers, that caused the formation of the original\r\ntrade unions. Laborers saw that each was helpless alone, but that\r\ncombined they were a power which their employers need not despise. The\r\nold craft guilds furnished them an example of effective combination\r\namong those engaged in the same trade; and as men everywhere in every\r\nage, when a common danger or misfortune has confronted them, have come\r\ntogether for mutual help and defence, these ignorant laborers, in\r\nviolation of stringent statutes, but following blindly their human\r\ninstincts of self-defence, came together and organized the first trade\r\nunions.\r\n\r\nThe common law has always held trade unions to be \"illegal combinations\r\nin restraint of trade.\" Between the reigns of Edward I. and George IV.,\r\nthe common law was affirmed and made more effective by the passage of\r\nover thirty acts of Parliament, all intended to abolish the trade\r\nunions. In 1800 a stringent law was passed, by which all persons\r\ncombining to advance their wages or decrease the quantity of their work,\r\nor in any way affect or control those who carried on the business in\r\nwhich they were employed, might be committed to jail by a justice for\r\nnot more than three months, or to work in the house of correction for\r\nnot more than two months. Not till 1824 was an act passed slightly\r\nameliorating this stringent law, and even then the trade unions remained\r\nfor the most part secret organizations. At last, in 1871 and 1876, laws\r\nwere passed under which no person can be prosecuted for conspiracy to\r\ncommit an act which would not be criminal if committed by him singly;\r\nand the trade unions, thus legalized, were taken in common with other\r\nbenefit societies under the protection of the law.\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out the main fact that the chief end and aim of\r\nthe trade unions is the advancement of wages by securing a monopoly of\r\nthe supply of labor in some particular trade. It is now fair to explain,\r\nas we have for other monopolies, the labor monopoly from the standpoint\r\nof the laborer himself.\r\n\r\nIt is a sound axiom of business that a forced sale is apt to be an\r\nunprofitable one to the seller; and that when a man's needs are so great\r\nthat he is absolutely obliged to sell at any price, he is quite certain\r\nnot to get the full worth of his goods. Now it is an undeniable fact\r\nthat the condition of many of the wage-workers of the country\r\napproximates to this: They must have food, shelter, and clothing for\r\nthemselves and their families, and the only thing they can offer in\r\nexchange for it is their labor. Suppose an honest and industrious man\r\nhas some misfortune, as an accident, or illness, and loses employment.\r\nWhen once more able to work, he finds his old place filled and new\r\nplaces hard to find; but at last he finds a mercenary employer who\r\nagrees to give him half wages. Disheartened at his prospects, he thinks\r\nhalf a loaf is better than no bread, especially when those dearest to\r\nhim are hungry, and so takes the place. But his employer takes care that\r\nhis constant work shall leave him no time to hunt for a better position.\r\nIndeed, by a few judicious threats from his employer, the man may be put\r\nin terror of losing the pittance he already has, and seeing those\r\ndependent on him in absolute starvation. Such cases are amply provided\r\nfor by the trade union. Ill treatment of any one of its members may be\r\navenged by the organization as a whole, on the principle, whose spirit\r\nof fraternity and self-sacrifice all must admire, that \"an injury to one\r\nis the concern of all.\" More than this, by means of the benefit feature\r\nof the fraternity, the member unfortunate, or in distress, is properly\r\ncared for. No member is obliged to feel, when seeking for employment,\r\nthat his food or shelter is at stake if his attempts fail, and he need\r\nnever be at the mercy of employers who drive sharp bargains.\r\n\r\nIt is often charged as an evil of trade-unions interfering with wages,\r\nthat they tend to bring all their members to the same level, and are\r\nopposed to the payment of wages in proportion to the varying abilities\r\nof the men working at the same employment. But with unorganized labor,\r\nand employers who were none too just in their ideas, it was not uncommon\r\nto see the necessity of the laborer, or his inability to drive a good\r\nbargain, taken advantage of. Thus the workmen whose necessities were\r\ngreatest, and who were the most docile and obedient, received lower\r\nwages than the men who were not particular whether they were busy or\r\nidle, and were inclined to pay more attention to their own rights and\r\nprerogatives than to the work for which they were hired. While the\r\ntendency toward non-recognition of the varying abilities and ambitions\r\nof workmen by the trade unions must be deprecated, it has largely grown\r\nfrom the reform of this worse abuse.\r\n\r\nThere is another benefit which the organization of labor has effected\r\nwhich may, perhaps, be thought an evil by some, but which every broad\r\nand generous man must gratefully recognize as a gain to the whole\r\ncommunity; and in a self-governed nation like our own, it is a benefit\r\nwhose importance it is difficult to over-estimate. This is the\r\nmaintenance of the laborer's dignity and self-respect. We have but to\r\nlook back to the times we have already mentioned, to see the laborer\r\nhardly better than a dog, a cringing dependent, kicked and beaten on\r\nslight pretext, and with almost every vestige of manhood worked and\r\nbullied out of him. We have come upon far happier times to-day, and\r\nthere are few corners of the civilized world where conditions so evil\r\nprevail now. But without the organization of labor, the status of\r\nworkingmen would be much farther removed from what is just and right\r\nthan it now is. Every employer who is wise and honest, and who has the\r\ntrue spirit of a gentleman, will see that his workmen are treated with\r\nthe respect that is their just due. Discipline there must be, but it is\r\na wrong view of discipline that makes it consist of oaths and brutal\r\ninsults delivered according to the prevalent good temper or ugliness of\r\nthe overseer. Unfortunately, not every man who is placed in authority is\r\nwise, honest, and a gentleman. Bodily violence is no longer permitted by\r\nlaw, but too often the curses and insults which are heaped on men with\r\nno due cause are a violence which is more severe to many a man than\r\nactual cuffs and kicks. No man can take such treatment without\r\nresentment, and maintain his dignity and self-respect. Yet in how many\r\nplaces is petty tyranny of this sort still active, and its victims are\r\ncowed into submission for fear of taking the bread from their children's\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\nBut the member of a strong labor organization need not be cowed or\r\ntamely accept insult. He has the right to resent it, and has the power\r\nof his fraternity to support him. He knows this, and his employer knows\r\nit. Overseers, big with their importance, and inclined to show it by\r\nattacking the self-respect of the men under them are no longer in\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nIt is very unfortunate that many people misconstrue this result of the\r\norganization of labor as a move toward the abolition of all social ranks\r\nand grades. It is nothing of the kind. Social gradations cannot be\r\ncreated or brushed away by any legislative enactment, or the acts of\r\nany single class. The combination of the workmen to secure their right\r\nto protect themselves from insult is indeed a movement toward making\r\nthem better and nobler men, just as the abolition of slavery in all its\r\nforms was a move in this direction. But no man is truly free if he is\r\nnot secure in his right to immunity from personal insult as well as from\r\nbodily violence. It is not strange, however, that the workman, conscious\r\nof the strength of the fraternity behind him, sometimes grows arrogant\r\nand insolent toward those who must necessarily be in authority over him.\r\nUnaccustomed for generations past to other government than fear of one\r\nsort or other, he is all unused to self-control. But it is hardly\r\npossible that this should be a great evil. The body of workmen will,\r\neventually, if not now, refuse to sanction and defend their members in\r\nany thing which their innate sense of justice must teach them is wrong.\r\nFew workingmen will causelessly ask their brotherhood to undertake the\r\nhardships and loss of prestige which accompany a strike. And even when\r\ninsolence is shown toward employers or overseers, they have at least\r\nequal power to resent it, and are not, as was the laborer of a\r\nhalf-century ago, forced to submit to insults with outward humility.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the condition of the laws in reference to the\r\nlaborer in former times: but the repeal of the laws oppressing the\r\nworkman, and making him a servant to a master instead of a workman for\r\nan employer, has been largely due to the organized efforts of the trade\r\nunions. To them, also, we owe the passage of many acts like those for\r\nthe guarding of machinery in factories, the restrictions upon the\r\nemployment of child labor, and the proper care for the health, comfort,\r\nand convenience of employés in general. It cannot be said that the\r\nlabor interests have always shown great wisdom in all their advocacy of\r\nnew legislation, and too many acts, like those in reference to the\r\nemployment of convict labor, show a lamentable retrogression. On the\r\nwhole, however, there is every reason to believe that the general course\r\nof justice has been aided by the influence of the trade\r\nunions--something which can be said of very few special interests for\r\nwhose benefit our legislatures have enacted laws.\r\n\r\nAll the above facts we must admit in defence of the organizations which\r\nhave, to a large degree, killed competition in the labor market. But in\r\ndefence of the especial action of the labor monopolists in forcing wages\r\nup to a point above that which competition alone would determine, there\r\nis also much to be said. Those who are unwilling to concede that there\r\nis any justice in the claim of the wage-workers that full justice is not\r\nyet awarded them, are accustomed to expand on the theme of the improved\r\ncondition of the laborer over that in which he was a century ago. How\r\nthis can be taken for argument is a mystery. No one thinks of disputing\r\nor diminifying the well-known fact that many workmen of to-day have more\r\ncomforts than the princes of the Middle Ages. The single point in\r\ndispute is this: Of the total wealth which is being produced in the\r\nworld to-day, is the laborer receiving his fair share? There are not\r\nwanting men of judgment and ability who answer this question with a\r\ndecided No. And the greater share of the blame for this injustice they\r\nlay upon the monopolies which we have been discussing. They charge, and\r\nthey verify their charge with ample and sound testimony, that of the\r\nwealth which the united brains, and strength, and skill of the world\r\ndaily produces, the lion's share is taken by men who render the world no\r\nproportionate service. This is partly due to existing laws, which the\r\npublic is not yet wise enough to better; partly to the inertia of public\r\nopinion, which is still prone to cling in many points to the idea of\r\npast generations that the workman was necessarily a slave; and partly to\r\nthe narrow selfishness and grasping ambition of many men in the business\r\nworld. This is not arguing for the reduction of all to a dead level, as\r\nis so often absurdly claimed. It is arguing that the inequalities which\r\nexist at the present day are not held securely in place by agreement\r\nwith the inflexible laws of justice and right. Instead they are abrupt\r\nand uneven, and contrary to these laws; and there is great danger that\r\nthe readjustment, which must inevitably take place to bring them in\r\naccord with these laws, will come, not as a gradual change, but as a\r\nseries of terrible social catastrophes, involving us in a wreck which\r\nwill require a century of civilization to repair.\r\n\r\nOnly fanatics preach absolute equality. As men differ in their ability\r\nand their power to serve the world, so is it just that the reward which\r\nthe world metes out to them should differ in like proportion. But if we\r\nstretch to the utmost the benefit which we conceive the world to derive\r\nfrom the life of many of its men who reap the richest harvest from its\r\nproduction, we cannot in any way make out that their services are so\r\nvaluable as to deserve such munificent reward. Indeed, it is not very\r\nfar from the truth to say of some of our most wealthy men that their\r\nwealth was won instead of earned; and many place a much worse term in\r\nthe place of \"won.\"\r\n\r\nThe workman sums up his case with the argument that as he is confessedly\r\nnot getting his just share of the results of his work, he is only\r\ngetting his due, or part of it, if by combination with his fellows to\r\ncrush out competition, he is able to put up the price of his labor above\r\nthe natural rate. Finally, as a last defence for the labor monopolies,\r\nhe calls attention to the trusts and pools and monopolies which are\r\ntaxing him at every hand for the necessaries of life, and declares that\r\nif he, working on the same principle as the wealthy capitalists, is able\r\nto combine his tens of thousands of fellows into an effective monopoly,\r\nsurely he should not be condemned for following the example of the men\r\nwho are, or are supposed to be, his social, moral, and intellectual\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\nSuch is the strong case which the labor organizations present in defence\r\nof the unions which they have formed to kill competition in the labor\r\nmarket. The investigation we have pursued in the preceding chapters\r\nenables us to add to this a statement of the case more comprehensive and\r\nstriking even, than the narrower views which have preceded. In the\r\nchapter on the monopolies in trade, reference was made to the fact that\r\nthe competition among purchasers tends to keep prices up, just as\r\ncompetition among sellers tends to keep them down. Now labor is a\r\ncommodity whose price in the market is governed by the same laws of\r\nsupply and demand that regulate the prices of all other things that are\r\nbought and sold. But it has this peculiar difference, that the _sellers_\r\nof labor are many, while the _purchasers_ are few, as compared with the\r\nrelative proportion of sellers and buyers of goods in general. Then,\r\nwherever there is little competition among purchasers of labor, we shall\r\nexpect to find low wages; and where competition to secure workmen is\r\nactive, high wages will be the rule. This is so obviously true, in the\r\nlight of every one's experience, that we need not stop to prove it.\r\nNow, in the days when manufacturing was carried on in small workshops,\r\nthere was a great number of purchasers of labor. The concentration of\r\nmanufacturing in great establishments where thousands of workmen are\r\nemployed has lessened the number of employers greatly; has it not also\r\nlessened competition among them? It is a well-known fact that in many\r\ngreat industries, as, for instance, the mining of coal or the\r\nmanufacture of iron, there is one rate of wages paid all through one\r\ndistrict, and the employers fix that rate through their associations.\r\nThe makers of trusts have sometimes defended them, on the ground that\r\nthey enabled the employer to pay his laborers higher wages; but it is\r\nplain that when all the firms in a trade are united in one combination,\r\nthere can be no competition between them for the employment of labor.\r\nThey will pay them only such wages as they choose; and the bulk of\r\nevidence seems to show that, notwithstanding the vast profits which the\r\nmonopolies are reaping, they have been far from showing any general\r\ndisposition to share their profits with their employés. It seems almost\r\nunquestionable that we have here the real reason for the extraordinary\r\nincrease of labor monopolies within the past quarter century. This\r\nperiod has witnessed a rapid growth of consolidation and combination in\r\nall our industries, lessening thus the number of employers of labor. The\r\nwage-worker found himself confronted with the fact that he was soon to\r\nlose entirely the benefit of competition for the purchase of his work,\r\nand felt that his only salvation from practical slavery was to prevent\r\nthe competition between himself and his comrades from forcing his wages\r\ndown to the starvation point. He met the monopoly that threatened to\r\nlower his wages by forming another monopoly that could meet the first on\r\nequal terms.\r\n\r\nWe have given little space in this chapter to the consideration of the\r\nlimit of the power of labor monopolies; but it is obvious that this is\r\nvery clearly defined. In the first place, while there are certain\r\nattempts at combination among unskilled laborers, and those not working\r\nat trades, these attempts cannot, as a general rule, be at all\r\nsuccessful. Any man out of employment may be a competitor for the work\r\nwhich they do, and it seems practically impossible that any organization\r\ncan combine, under effective discipline, even a majority of the\r\nworkingmen of the country not skilled in a trade. The only ways in which\r\nattempts to kill competition in unskilled labor can be successful, then,\r\nare by the use of force or the boycott, or similar means, and these can\r\nnever come into vogue as permanent agents in the world's industry. The\r\nlabor monopolies which exist, and which promise, if let alone, to enjoy\r\ncontinued success, are principally combinations of the workers in\r\nskilled trades, and certain of those employed in manufacturing, mining,\r\ntrade, and transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLIES AND COMPETITION IN OTHER INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we take a look back over the long list of monopolies which we have\r\ninvestigated in the preceding chapters, the natural thought is that we\r\nhave considered now the greater part of the industries of the country.\r\nCertainly these occupations of manufacturing and trade and\r\ntransportation, are generally considered as our important industries,\r\nand a pretty good share of our legislation and public agitation concerns\r\nitself with the welfare of these industries and with the men who are\r\nemployed in them. But certain questions will naturally arise in the\r\ncurious mind. Just what proportion of our total working population are\r\nemployed in these industries; and of that number how many are reaping\r\nthe profits of the monopoly? What are the remaining occupations of our\r\npeople, and are the workers in them doing any thing to destroy\r\ncompetition? To the investigation of these matters we will devote the\r\npresent chapter.\r\n\r\nThe United States Census Bureau classes the gainful occupations of the\r\npeople in four great divisions: (1) Agriculture. (2) Professional and\r\nPersonal Service. (3) Trade and Transportation. (4) Manufacturing,\r\nMining, and Mechanical Industries. The monopolies which we have studied\r\nin the preceding chapters are all included in the last two classes. The\r\ntotal number of persons engaged in trade and transportation in the\r\ncountry in 1880 is given as 1,810,256, and the total engaged in\r\nmanufacturing, mechanical, and mining operations is 3,837,112, or a\r\ntotal of 5,647,368 in all these occupations among which we have found\r\nmonopolies to exist. Of course the great proportion of the persons\r\nincluded in the above number have no direct interest in the profits of\r\nthe industries in whose operation they aid. It is, indeed, argued that\r\nthe manufacturer, miner, or merchant who is making enormous profits,\r\npays, therefore, larger and more generous wages; but it is urged on the\r\nother side that while this is true in isolated cases, the general rule\r\nholds good that the price of labor is governed by the law of supply and\r\ndemand; and that, as already pointed out, monopoly among producers means\r\na monopoly among purchasers of labor. Let us now, however, leave out\r\nthis indirect benefit which may, or may not, accrue to the workmen in\r\nthese various occupations, and find as nearly as we can the number which\r\nare, or can possibly be, directly benefited by the operation of\r\nmonopolies. Let us deduct from the total of 5,647,368, such classes of\r\npersons as it is evident cannot have a direct share in the results of a\r\nmonopoly and are not engaged as skilled workmen in a trade which has\r\nbeen organized to control competition.\r\n\r\nWe may certainly deduct the following items from the total:\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------+----------+\r\n  | Agents                                                  |   18,523 |\r\n  | Clerks, salesmen, and accountants in stores             |  445,513 |\r\n  | Commercial travellers, hucksters, and peddlers          |   81,649 |\r\n  | Draymen, hackmen, teamsters, etc.                       |  177,586 |\r\n  | Sailors, steamboat-men, canal-men, pilots, and watermen |  100,902 |\r\n  | Apprentices                                             |   44,170 |\r\n  | Blacksmiths                                             |  172,726 |\r\n  | Fishermen and oystermen                                 |   41,352 |\r\n  | Lumbermen, raftsmen, and wood-choppers                  |   43,382 |\r\n  | Photographers                                           |    9,990 |\r\n  | Saw-mill operatives                                     |   77,050 |\r\n  | Tailors, tailoresses, milliners, and dressmakers        |  419,157 |\r\n  |                                                         +----------+\r\n  |    Total                                                |1,632,000 |\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------+----------+\r\n\r\nThere are a great many other occupations in the list[4] from which these\r\nitems are taken which might properly be included in the above, as the\r\ncombination which does or can exist in them it is almost certain is of\r\nno practical importance. On the other hand, however, our total of\r\n5,647,368 takes no account of the persons interested in trade,\r\ntransportation, or manufacturing through holding the shares or bonds of\r\nincorporated companies; also the errors and omissions of the census are\r\nso great in any event that only broad and general statements can be\r\nbased upon them. Deducting, then, from the total of 5,647,368 the\r\n1,632,000, which we found to be surely not interested in monopolies, we\r\nhave about four million persons as the utmost number who are benefited\r\nby the profits of the monopolies which we have thus far considered. But\r\nlet us look into this a little farther. As we have already stated, the\r\nmonopolies of trade are generally unable to raise prices far above their\r\nnormal rate. In retail trade, especially, competition shows great\r\ntenacity of life. Also with regard to labor monopolies, it is true, as\r\nwe have already stated, that the limits of their operation are pretty\r\nclosely defined; even the men in the highest grades of skilled labor\r\ncannot secure for each workman by any combination more than two or\r\nthree dollars per day over what he would receive under the freest\r\ncompetition. Let us, therefore, deduct from the preceding four millions\r\nthe persons engaged in retail trade, and all skilled laborers in the\r\nvarious trades which we formerly included because we conceived that they\r\nmight be connected with some form of labor organization, and might also\r\nobtain some benefit through the profits of their employers. But when we\r\nmake these deductions we find that we have only a hundred thousand or so\r\nof our four millions left. Briefly summed up, therefore, the fact is,\r\nthat the strong monopolies in manufacturing, mining, trade, and\r\ntransportation are owned by a very small portion of the population. Just\r\nwhat this number is, it is impossible to say, for the stock and bonds of\r\nrailroad companies, mining companies, and manufacturing companies are\r\nchanging hands continually, and no public record is taken of their\r\ndistribution and ownership. It may possibly be true, however, that one\r\nmillion different persons own an interest in some of the various\r\nmonopolies which we have studied, excluding the monopolies in trade and\r\nlabor. But even if this estimate is correct, it is a well-known fact\r\nthat a few hundred immensely wealthy men hold a large share of the stock\r\nof these very profitable monopolies.\r\n\r\n    [4] From the \"Compendium of the Tenth Census of the United States,\"\r\n    Part II., pp. 1378 and 1384.\r\n\r\nLeaving the questions which this statement opens up, for later\r\nconsideration, let us consider the other classes of occupations in which\r\nmen engage for the purpose of gain, and see if this far-reaching\r\nmovement towards the destruction of competition has infected them, and\r\nwhether it has proved, or can prove, so successful there as it has in\r\nthe industries considered in preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nThe third great class of occupations, rendering professional or personal\r\nservice, gives employment to over four million persons (4,074,328), and\r\nincludes in its members those in widely separated ranks of society.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, true that the competition in the professions is far\r\nmore a competition of ability, real or supposed, than it is a\r\ncompetition of price; and the former is a competition which is never\r\nlikely to be done away with. Yet in all occupations, to a greater or\r\nless degree, there tends to arise more or less competition in relation\r\nto price, and the professions are not entirely exempt. Lawyers, indeed,\r\nseem never to have felt the necessity of fixing any minimum tariff of\r\nfees; and so far as is known, clergymen have never combined to advance\r\ntheir salaries. But the medical profession has its well known code of\r\nethics which debars its members from \"pushing their business,\" and has,\r\nin certain places and times at least, prescribed a minimum tariff of\r\nfees. It should be clearly understood, however, that this is not cited\r\nwith the intention of putting any aspersion upon the medical profession\r\nin any way. The services which are freely rendered to the poor, and the\r\ndisgusting indecencies and insults which are thrust upon the public by\r\nsome who choose to ignore this code of medical ethics, would make us\r\nready to forgive very much worse things than a possible tendency among\r\nmembers of the profession to refrain from \"cutting under each other\" in\r\nthe matter of fees.\r\n\r\nBut while the three older professions have evidently little need or\r\ndisposition to combine for the purpose of increasing their income from\r\nthe community, some of the newer professions occupy different ground.\r\nArchitecture is coming to be a profession of no small importance. The\r\nprincipal architects' society, the Association of American Architects,\r\nhas a regular schedule of minimum commissions below which its members\r\nare forbidden to go. Another singular case of professional combination\r\nis the Musical Protective Union, a combination of professional musicians\r\nin New York City, which fixes minimum prices that its members may charge\r\nfor their services. On the whole, however, it must be said that the\r\nlimitation of competition in the professional and intellectual\r\noccupations is in this country still in its infancy. In England the\r\nfixing of prices of professional service by usage is very much more\r\ncommon, and in many professions the check to competition thus effected\r\nis of no small importance. To the careful observer there are indications\r\nof a tendency in a similar direction in this country. Is it not more and\r\nmore common in professional circles to see a slur cast on the man who\r\nwill work cheaply? There is hardly an occupation or specialty which has\r\nnot its Associations and its periodicals; and what is more natural than\r\nthat an association for mutual benefit should come to adopt that certain\r\nmethod of securing mutual benefit at the expense of the public, the\r\nrestraint of competition?\r\n\r\nExamining the remaining occupations in this division, we find that those\r\nengaged in them form a large percentage of the whole population. There\r\nare of laborers whose occupation is not more definitely specified,\r\n1,859,223. Then there are 1,075,655 domestic servants, 121,942\r\nlaunderers, 77,413 hotel and restaurant employés, 24,000 soldiers,\r\n14,000 messengers, and enough in other occupations similar to the above,\r\nin that very many persons can engage in them without special training,\r\nto make it certain that at least three fourths of the members of this\r\ndivision, or a little over three million persons, belong to the class of\r\nunskilled workers, among whom, as we have already seen, the attempt to\r\nlimit competition and force up wages has not, and cannot possibly have,\r\nmore than a limited and doubtful success. Nevertheless, to a very great\r\nextent, the unskilled laborers of the country as well as those working\r\nat minor trades are organized for mutual help and protection; and while\r\nthey cannot increase much the rate of their wages without drawing a host\r\nof competitors, they can do much in the way of protecting themselves\r\nfrom injustice and extortion, as we have pointed out in the preceding\r\nchapter. It may be possible, indeed, that certain changes in the future,\r\nas the requirement of greater skill and efficiency in all kinds of\r\nlabor, may make combinations in this class of occupations easier and\r\nmore effective. Our domestic affairs, for instance, are constantly\r\ngrowing more complex, and require greater skill in their operation.\r\nHousekeepers are prone to think the \"servant girl\" problem serious and\r\nperplexing enough already. It remains to be seen what they would say if\r\na \"Cooks' Protective Union,\" a \"Chambermaids' Sisterhood,\" or a\r\n\"Laundresses' Amalgamated Association,\" should assume control of the\r\nwages and hours of labor of their domestics.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we find that as a whole the 4,000,000 persons engaged in\r\nrendering professional and personal services are in general not\r\nincreasing the cost to the public of their services by combining\r\ntogether to limit competition; and that so far as we can determine, it\r\nis not probable that many of them can do so in the future, even if they\r\nare so disposed.\r\n\r\nThere remains yet one important class of the community to be considered:\r\nthose engaged in agriculture. Can the farmers of the country fall into\r\nline behind the manufacturers and miners and railroad owners, and force\r\nup the price of their products by killing competition, to correspond\r\nwith the increased prices which are demanded in many other lines of\r\nindustry? They have one thing in their favor in that the principal\r\nproducts of the soil are necessaries of life, which the community cannot\r\ndo without whether the price be great or small, although an increase in\r\nprice is sure to result in a decreased consumption.\r\n\r\nWe may best determine this question by inquiring exactly how the prices\r\nare forced up by monopolies. There can be but one way. The laws of\r\nsupply and demand hold good, and it is out of the power of the producer\r\nto greatly affect the demand. It is only the supply of which he has\r\ncontrol. From the manufacturers' trust to the laborers' union, the only\r\nway in which prices can be controlled is through a reduction in the\r\nsupply of goods made or men allowed to work; and if the price were to be\r\narbitrarily raised, the result would be the same; there would be a\r\nsurplus of goods, or some unemployed workmen. In order to raise the\r\nprice of his products, then, the farmer must do one of two things, which\r\nwill bring in the end the same result. He must send less of his products\r\nto market--lessen the supply--or refuse to sell any thing at less than\r\nthe increased price which he desires. In either case, if he plants the\r\nsame acreage and gets the same yield as before, he will have a part of\r\nhis crop left on his hands.\r\n\r\nThe query then comes, can it be possible for the farmers all over the\r\ncountry to form so perfect and well-disciplined an organization that\r\nevery member shall diminish his remittances to market of grain, wool,\r\nmeat, hay, or what not, enough to raise prices; or that he shall refrain\r\nfrom selling all these articles below a certain defined price? It must\r\nbe plain to every intelligent person that it would be a practical\r\nimpossibility to effect such a thing. It would be possible to bring only\r\na small percentage of the farmers in an area 3,000 miles in length and\r\n1,500 in width into a single organization; and it would be essential to\r\nthe success of this, as of every other scheme, that no outside\r\ncompetition should be permitted to exist.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that the Knights of Labor succeeded to a degree in\r\ngathering into one organization a large proportion of the workingmen in\r\nall the various trades in the country; but their members were mostly in\r\ncities, many worked together in great factories, and as regards ease of\r\ncombination, they were far more easily handled than the widely scattered\r\nfarmers of the country could hope to be. Besides, the Knights of Labor\r\norganization appears to be too unwieldy and cumbrous to be long\r\nsuccessful, and internal dissension seems to have already brought it\r\nnear its end. It is plain that the farmers are powerless to effect a\r\nreduction of the competition among themselves. Nor is this condition at\r\nall likely to change. Farming is unlike other modern productive\r\nindustries in that the cost of production does not decrease as it is\r\nconducted on a larger scale. The most profitable farms are, and perhaps\r\nwill always be, the small ones, where the details of the tillage come\r\ndirectly under the eye of the owner.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts with respect to the prospect of making a monopoly of\r\nagriculture, and it would seem that they are so simple and so easily\r\nunderstood that no attempt would ever be made to restrict competition\r\namong farmers. It is to be recorded, however, that such attempts are\r\nbeing seriously made. Prominent farmers of the West in the spring of\r\n1888 took the preliminary steps towards the formation of a farmers'\r\ntrust. Conventions were held and resolutions adopted reciting that the\r\noperation of trusts in manufacturing industries and of monopolies in\r\ntrade and transportation laid serious burdens on the farmers of the\r\ncountry; and that in order not to be left behind in the struggle for\r\nexistence the farmers must combine for their own protection. Committees\r\nwere appointed to work out the details of a plan of organization; but\r\nthe movement seems to have lost vitality when its projectors came to\r\nstudy it in detail. The preceding argument fully explains the reason.\r\n\r\nIt should be said, however, that coöperative associations among the\r\nfarmers are growing at a rapid pace. The Grange and the Farmers'\r\nAlliance are primarily coöperative associations for the purpose of\r\nbenefiting their members in the purchase of goods and in various other\r\ndirections, and they are fast increasing in numbers and influence. The\r\nattempts made to benefit their members in the sale of their produce have\r\nbeen generally confined to protection against the \"middle men.\" The only\r\nmovement of which the author is aware for restricting production to\r\nincrease price, has been in certain sections of the South, where\r\nrecently a general attempt has been made to restrict the acreage planted\r\nin tobacco in the hope of raising the price.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter worthy of note here that the combined influence of the\r\nfarmers of the country has recently been successful in securing\r\nlegislation to defeat an important outside competitor. A few years ago\r\nsome chemists found out that from a cheap substance known as beef suet,\r\nan imitation butter could be made, which was in composition and\r\nappearance the same as butter made by the ordinary process, and was\r\nexactly as nourishing a food. There has been much talk of the halcyon\r\ndays to come when the progress of science will be so great that food\r\nwill be made in the laboratory. Well, here was an important practical\r\nstep in that direction. A cheap product worth three or four cents a\r\npound could be easily converted by a chemical treatment into a valuable\r\nfood worth three times as much, and the great profit in the business\r\nbrought this substitute for butter rapidly into use. But at once an\r\nindignant protest went up from the farmers of the land. They were being\r\nruined by the competition of the \"grease butter\" as they disrespectfully\r\ncalled it. There was something suggested about the idea that if just as\r\ngood butter could be made out of the fat of the cow as out of her milk,\r\nand at half the expense, that it would be a benefit to everybody in the\r\ncountry who had butter to buy. But the weak protest for the protection\r\nof the general interests of the whole people was not heeded, and\r\nCongress passed a bill laying a tax on the new butter sufficient to stop\r\nthe sale. Here was an evident case of killing competition for the sake\r\nof the farming interests, and the force of their unorganized sentiment\r\nalone was sufficient to secure the desired legislation. But when the\r\nfarmers attempt to form a trust, they will have to kill competition\r\namong themselves instead of outside competition; and that is a different\r\nand far harder matter.\r\n\r\nTo agricultural laborers the same rule applies which we have found to\r\ngovern other unskilled labor, viz.: that combination cannot effect much\r\nin raising wages. Added to this is the fact that they are widely\r\nscattered, and that a great proportion do not follow this as a steady\r\noccupation. In England, indeed, there is an agricultural laborers'\r\nunion, and we may possibly come to that here. But our circumstances are\r\nwidely different. The fact that in many sections the agricultural\r\nlaborer is not a \"hand,\" or an \"employé,\" or \"servant,\" but a \"hired\r\nman,\" is an important one, for the difference in terms denote a vast\r\ndifference in conditions. It is hardly likely that an organization of\r\nany sort is to be expected among those in this occupation.\r\n\r\nThis last division of occupations contains the most members of any of\r\nthe four divisions. The farmers of the country number 4,225,945 and the\r\nfarm laborers number 3,323,876. Other minor occupations of the division,\r\nas gardener, florist, etc., bring up the total engaged in agriculture to\r\n7,670,493.\r\n\r\nWe can now make some interesting comparisons. The evident effect of\r\nmonopoly is, in general, to tax the community at large for the benefit\r\nof those who own the monopoly. Let us see what proportion exists between\r\nthe two classes:\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+------------+\r\n  | Total number of persons engaged in manufacturing,   |            |\r\n  | mining, trade, and transportation (occupations more |            |\r\n  | or less monopolized)                                |  5,647,368 |\r\n  |                                                     |            |\r\n  | Total number of persons engaged in agriculture and  |            |\r\n  | in furnishing professional and personal services    |            |\r\n  | (occupations not monopolized)                       | 11,744,821 |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThus at the greatest estimate we can make of the number benefited by\r\nmonopolies, for each man who is gaining by them, two are having their\r\nincome reduced. If we take the estimate previously made, that the utmost\r\nnumber of persons who can possibly be reaping benefit by ownership of\r\nthe especially profitable monopolies, trusts, transportation lines,\r\nmines, etc., is one million, we have opposed over sixteen millions of\r\nthe community who are being taxed by their operation. Let a sharp\r\ndistinction be drawn at this point, however. The above comparison is to\r\nbe confined to the things between which it is made, and not confused\r\nwith others to which it has no reference. It is not a comparison of the\r\nsort which social agitators are fond of making between the great numbers\r\nof the working classes and the relative scarcity of the wealthy. Except\r\nso far as the operation of profitable monopolies by the few tends to\r\nbring about this unequal distribution of wealth, that is a matter with\r\nwhich we have nothing now to do.\r\n\r\nThere is one point in this connection, however, which it is well to make\r\nplain, as it concerns a class of people which is not included in either\r\nof the four divisions that we have already described--those who live on\r\nthe income of their property.\r\n\r\nWe have before alluded to the fact that in the popular speech\r\n\"capitalist\" and \"monopolist\" are often used interchangeably. If we\r\ncarefully consider the real status of the capitalist, however, we find\r\nthat of the three requisites of production--labor, capital, and natural\r\nagents--capital is the requisite which is most perfectly secured from\r\nthe control of monopoly. The rate of interest for the use of capital is\r\nregulated so perfectly by the law of supply and demand, that all the\r\nanti-usury laws which have ever been enacted have been able to\r\naccomplish but little in enabling the borrower to secure loans at a less\r\nrate than that prescribed by competition. The reason for this is plain\r\non consideration. The total supply of accumulated wealth of the whole\r\ncivilized world is engaged in this competition, and the millions of\r\nwealth which are added every day are new contestants in the market.\r\nCompetition in other products is held in local bounds by the cost of\r\nshipment over long distances; but wealth in the form of value can be\r\ntransferred quickly and easily to any part of the civilized world where\r\na market awaits it. Every person who earns money or owns property is a\r\npotential competitor, in that he can be made to lend his capital for\r\ngreat enough inducements. Under the pressure of this competition, the\r\nprice for the use of capital--the rate of interest--has steadily fallen;\r\nand the enormous production of wealth of which our industrial resources\r\nare now capable is such that the fall is certain to continue, and a very\r\nfew years will see loans at 2 per cent. as common as those at 4 per\r\ncent. are to-day. Combination to restrict competition among those who\r\nloan capital for investment is an utter impossibility. The number of\r\npeople with money to loan, or with property on which they can raise\r\nmoney for that purpose, if they wish, is too large a proportion of the\r\npopulation to be ever brought into a combination to restrict\r\ncompetition. The stringency which sometimes occurs in the money market\r\nneed not be cited as a contradiction of this statement. That is a matter\r\nwhich has only to do with the currency. The broad fact, and it is a most\r\nimportant one, is that capital, a necessary agent of production, can\r\nnever be monopolized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF UNIVERSAL COMPETITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now examined all the important occupations in which men engage\r\nfor the purpose of gain; and we have found that while certain large\r\nclasses of men still have the returns for their industry fixed by the\r\nlaws of competition, other large and important classes have been able to\r\ncheck and limit competition, so that their returns from their work are\r\nconstantly increased; while others still, are in possession of certain\r\nagents, so necessary to the community and so rare, that a price can be\r\nexacted for their use greatly in excess of the original cost to their\r\nowners. Some of the effects of this state of affairs it is easy to\r\nperceive. We have, indeed, pointed out for each monopoly described some\r\nof the especial abuses to which it gives rise; and it is plain enough\r\nthat the general tendency is, first, to greatly enrich the possessors of\r\nthe strongest monopolies at the expense of all other men; second, to\r\ngive a certain degree of advantage to the possessors of minor\r\nmonopolies,--as, for instance, monopolies in articles which are\r\nluxuries, and can easily be dispensed with; and third, to seriously\r\ninjure all those engaged in occupations in which the price of the\r\nproduct is still fixed by competition.\r\n\r\nEvery one will agree that this is an evil state of affairs. It is not\r\njust that my neighbor, who owns a mine or a railroad, should ask me\r\nwhat he pleases for coal, or for carriage of my produce to market; while\r\nI, being a farmer, must sell the products of my labor at a price\r\ndetermined by competition with the products of ten thousand other farms.\r\nNo one can deny at this day that it is contrary to the principles of\r\njustice to give to the men in any one occupation or calling an advantage\r\nover those in any other, except in just the degree that one occupation\r\nis more beneficial to the world than another. The question then arises,\r\nhow may we best remedy this state of affairs? Shall our panacea be to do\r\naway with all monopolies, and put every industry back upon the\r\ncompetitive system? If so, by what means are we to apply this remedy? Or\r\nshall we go to the other extreme and adopt the antipodal doctrine to the\r\nforegoing, that competition is an evil which ought to be done away with;\r\nand then proceed to abolish competition in every trade and occupation\r\nwhere it still exists, if we can find any possible means of\r\naccomplishing such a task.\r\n\r\nThe investigation we have already pursued gives us no answer to these\r\nquestions. We have thus far studied facts, and made little attempt to\r\ndeduce from them general truths. We are now informed as to the\r\nwidespread growth of monopoly; and we have paid some attention to the\r\ninjustice and wrong to which it gives rise, in order that we may\r\nunderstand the urgent necessity for finding the right remedies, and\r\nfinding them at once. Our study is henceforth to be devoted to this end.\r\nHow shall we go about it? In the first place, it is evident that we\r\nmight make a far wider and more detailed investigation of existing\r\nmonopolies, and still be no nearer our desired end. We might study the\r\nfacts concerning each especial railroad monopoly in the country, for\r\ninstance, without reaching any valuable conclusion with regard to the\r\nproper method of restricting railroad monopolies in general. But if we\r\nwere to take the monopoly exercised by a single railroad company, and\r\nstudy the principles on which it is founded and the laws by which it is\r\ngoverned, we might then be able to state something of value in reference\r\nto proper methods for its control. Evidently, then, principles rather\r\nthan facts are to be the chief subjects of our future discussion,\r\nalthough, of course, we can only discover these principles by\r\ninvestigating the facts already found, together with others which may\r\ncome to our notice.\r\n\r\nOur very first and most obvious generalization from the facts which we\r\nhave studied is, that in all the monopolies we have considered, the\r\ninherent principle is the same, and the effect on the community is of\r\nthe same sort. Therefore, instead of hunting for separate remedies for\r\nrailroad monopolies and trusts and labor monopolies, we will see what\r\nthe general problem of monopoly is, and what is the general nature of\r\nthe remedy that should be applied; the details applicable to each case\r\nwill, of course, be different; but the underlying principle must be the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nBut if we examine our problem a little more closely we see that the word\r\n_monopoly_ seems to be only a negative, expressing the fact that\r\n_competition_ is absent. We will therefore direct our studies to\r\ncompetition itself, and will consider first its action as the basis of\r\nour social system.\r\n\r\nIn the most primitive condition of man which we can imagine, each person\r\nprovided for his or her own need. The competition which then existed was\r\nnot competition, in the sense which we use the word in this volume, but\r\nwas a struggle for existence and a gratification of the baser desires,\r\nof the same sort as that which now prevails in the brute creation,\r\nresulting in a \"survival of the fittest.\" With the introduction of the\r\nfamily relation, the principle of the \"division of labor\" was utilized,\r\nthe female doing the hard and menial work, while the male devoted\r\nhimself to hunting and fishing, or subsisting on the results of his\r\nhelpmate's industry. As men's wants increased and they became more\r\nindustrious in supplying them, this division of labor was extended. The\r\nman most skilful in fishing neglected the use of the bow and spear, and\r\nhis surplus of fish he exchanged with his neighbor for the fruit of the\r\nchase. The very same principle applied to different tribes brought about\r\nthe first commerce. A pastoral tribe, with large flocks and herds,\r\nexchanged their surplus products with less civilized tribes who\r\ncontinued to live by the chase, or with a more civilized people who had\r\nbegun to till the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that these were first steps in civilization. Man, so long as\r\nhe supplies only such of his wants as he can supply with the labor of\r\nhis unaided hands, must remain in a half-fed, half-clothed, and untaught\r\ncondition, because his strength and skill, when diverted in the many\r\ndirections which his wants require, are not enough to enable him, even\r\nwhen he spends all his time at work, to supply himself with more than\r\nthe barest necessaries of life. It would be interesting to trace the\r\ndevelopment of this principle of action through its various stages down\r\nto the present time, when we see men everywhere working at various\r\ntrades and occupations, and always to supply some want of their\r\nfellow-men. Every person in the community is absolutely dependent upon a\r\nmultitude of others, most of whom he knows nothing of, for the supply\r\nof almost all his wants. Human society is thus growing more and more\r\ninterwoven and interdependent. The motto of the Knights of Labor is a\r\ntrue one, apart from the altruism involved in it. \"An injury to one _is_\r\nthe concern of all,\" because the mass of humanity is connected and woven\r\ntogether by such strong ties of self-interest, as well as fraternity,\r\nthat a calamity to any class or country is felt in some degree\r\nthroughout the civilized world. This is vastly more true now than it was\r\na half-century ago. Under such conditions as existed then, the doctrine\r\nof _laissez-faire_, that the government should confine itself to the\r\nprevention of violence and crime and the maintenance of national honor\r\nand integrity, letting alone the industries of the country to develop\r\nand operate according to natural laws, was not liable to do harm. But\r\nthe conditions now are wholly changed. The interdependence of the\r\ncommunity involves a moral inter-responsibility, and the time has come\r\nwhen we must recognize this by making it a legal responsibility as well.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to consider in detail this inter-relationship of\r\nsociety, and to examine the natural laws which govern it. We have\r\nalready stated the fact that, broadly speaking, each man is engaged in\r\nsupplying the wants of his fellow men, because in that way better than\r\nin any other he can supply his own wants. We shall find this an easy\r\nmatter to understand if we conceive that every man puts the products of\r\nhis labor, of whatever sort it be, into a common public stock (offers it\r\nfor sale), and takes out of this common stock (buys) the various\r\narticles which he wants. He does the first simply that he may do the\r\nsecond, not because he desires to benefit his fellow-men. The money\r\nwhich he receives (as we do not propose to consider here any questions\r\nregarding the currency) we may regard as simply a certificate that he\r\nhas done a certain amount of work for the world, the measure of which is\r\nthe number of dollars he receives; and on presentation of that\r\ncertificate, he can obtain other articles which he desires.\r\n\r\nWe have next to consider the fact that there is a great variation in the\r\namount which a man can take out from this common stock. One man is able\r\nto provide himself from the common stock with a host of luxuries, while\r\nanother may only take out a scant supply of the barest necessaries of\r\nlife. If this distribution operated with perfect equity, a man would be\r\npermitted to take out of this common stock exactly in proportion to the\r\nbenefit which the world at large received from that which he put in. No\r\nhuman judgment, however, is competent to fix, with even an approach to\r\nprecision, the relative actual benefit which each member of society\r\nrenders to his fellow-men as a whole. But our social system effects that\r\nfor us better than it could be fixed by any arbitrary human judgment.\r\nThis it does by a law known as the law of supply and demand. Instead of\r\nthe actual benefit, this law takes what people choose to consider as\r\nbenefit, which is the granting of their desires, whether they desire\r\nthings hurtful or beneficial. It is these desires for things which\r\nothers can produce which constitute demand. It is to be borne in mind\r\nthat this is a broad term, and includes not only desires for food,\r\nclothing, and actual things, but for service of every sort, in short,\r\ndemand is the desire for any thing whatever for which people are willing\r\nto pay money. But when there is this demand--this willingness to pay\r\nmoney for any article--people begin at once to supply it, because the\r\nmoney they receive allows them to take goods which they wish from the\r\ncommon stock. Evidently, if there is an unlimited supply of any thing,\r\npeople will not pay money for it. People will not pay money for fresh\r\nair to breathe when they are out-of-doors, and the supply is unlimited;\r\nbut when indoors, the supply may be limited, and they will spend money\r\nto have ventilators and air-pipes built to supply them with fresh air.\r\nOr take the contrary case: The supply of some commodity, say flour,\r\nfalls very short. Evidently less flour must be used by the world than\r\nwas used in the years of a more plentiful wheat harvest. But no one will\r\nwish to be the one to go without, and most people will pay a little more\r\nrather than do so. Therefore the price rises.\r\n\r\nThe competition which we have chiefly considered is the rivalry which\r\nexists between the men who supply the same sort of goods; but there is a\r\nrivalry among buyers as well. Speaking generally, every buyer is trying\r\nto purchase for as little as possible, and every seller is trying to\r\ndispose of his goods or services to the world for as much as possible,\r\nwhich each has a perfect right to do.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that prices vary with the relative proportion\r\nbetween supply and demand, rising as demand rises or supply fails, and\r\nfalling as supply increases or demand falls off. But to complete the\r\nwonderful perfection of the mechanism, the reciprocal relation is\r\nintroduced, so that supply and demand vary with price. If the price\r\nrises, fewer people can afford to buy and more will be anxious to sell;\r\nwhile if the price falls, more people will wish to buy and fewer people\r\nwill be willing to sell.\r\n\r\nWe can now easily see why some men are able to take out from the world's\r\ncommon stock of product so large an amount, while most men can take but\r\na meagre allowance. By the law of supply and demand the price is far\r\nhigher for the service which one man renders to the world than another.\r\nLet us take the operation of a large machine shop, for instance. Only\r\none superintendent is needed, and he should be a man who has devoted\r\nmuch time to mastering all the details of the business, and is\r\nexperienced and competent to so govern the work that a large product\r\nwill be turned out at a small expense. There is a demand in the country,\r\nlet us say, for 5,000 such men; but out of the 5,000 who are filling\r\nsuch places, there are perhaps 50 who seem almost faultless in their\r\nskill and industry, there are 500 who are with one or two exceptional\r\nfaults, almost equally efficient, there are 3,000 who are fairly good\r\nmen, and the rest may be classed as those who hold their positions\r\nbecause better men for the place cannot be had. So with the skilled\r\nmachinists, the relation of supply and demand is such that the price of\r\ntheir labor is kept up to perhaps $4.00 per day. But of common laborers\r\nthe supply is so related to demand that the price of their work is very\r\nlow. Thus the three classes take very unequal amounts from the common\r\nstock. The superintendent, perhaps, is able to take five thousand\r\ndollars' worth of goods each year. The skilled workman can spend perhaps\r\none thousand five hundred dollars, while the laborer can spend but five\r\nor six hundred dollars. Thus the men who secure the greatest amount of\r\nwealth in return for their services to the world, secure it because\r\npeople are willing to pay it rather than pay less for men of less\r\nability. This is not the same as rewarding a man according to the actual\r\nbenefit which he does to the community, but it is an approach to it; and\r\nit seems to be as close an approach as is possible by human methods.\r\n\r\nThis social system is not the creation of any man or set of men, but has\r\ngrown of itself out of the tendency among men to secure the things they\r\nwish for with the least exertion. And its theoretical working is\r\nmarvellously perfect. Any thing which men desire sufficiently to exert\r\nthemselves to secure it, can be bought with a small part of the time and\r\nlabor, measured in money, which would be required if each made it for\r\nhimself. Not only this, but the aim of every man is to do the greatest\r\nservice to the world and best meet its desires, thus securing in return\r\nthe greatest rewards for himself. Rivalry among purchasers constantly\r\ntends to increase the rewards of the producers, while competition among\r\nthe latter tends toward the furnishing of a better article at a smaller\r\nprice. These two forces hold each other in stable equilibrium, for a\r\nvariation tends always to bring things back to their normal condition.\r\n\r\nLet us look more closely at the theory of the competition among\r\nproducers. We see that, speaking broadly, all occupations are competing\r\nwith each other. If changes in the supply or demand raise the rewards in\r\nany calling, men will leave other work to engage in it. Men by the\r\npressure of competition are forced to seek out the easiest and most\r\ndirect methods, and to learn how to secure the greatest results with the\r\nleast expenditure of labor and material.\r\n\r\nIt is this principle which lies at the very root of our industrial\r\ndevelopment. Men have so striven to meet each other's competition and\r\noutstrip each other in the production of superior goods at low prices,\r\nthat the cost of the staple articles of consumption, measuring by the\r\nlabor required to produce them now and the labor required by the clumsy\r\ntools and hand work of a century ago, is from a tenth to a hundredth of\r\nthe cost in those days. It must be remembered, too, that this system of\r\ncompetition is in accordance with the sense of inalienable personal\r\nrights which is implanted in the breast of every man. The work of my\r\nhands and brain are my own. In disposing of it for a price, I have a\r\nright which none may deny to obtain such a sum as I can induce any one\r\nto pay me. If I choose to sell it for less than my neighbor, it is my\r\nright. In short, the open market is open to all; and every man has a\r\nright to sell there his labor, his skill, or his goods, of whatever sort\r\nhe can produce, at such a price as he can obtain. The same is true of\r\nthe buyer. I have a _right_ to go into the open market and secure such\r\ngoods as any one wishes to sell me at the lowest price for which he will\r\npart with them. A curious illustration of this sense of personal right\r\nis the custom duties on imported goods. It is an evidence of this\r\ninherent feeling of a natural right that both public opinion and the law\r\nhold that it is a much less serious crime to smuggle than to steal.\r\nThere are a dozen people who would smuggle, if tempted to do so, to one\r\nwho would steal. Another illustration is the opposition shown to\r\nsumptuary laws on the same grounds.\r\n\r\nIt is to be said that the fact that competition lies at the foundation\r\nof our industrial civilization, tersely expressed in the saying,\r\n\"Competition is the life of trade,\" has long been known, and, to a\r\ncertain extent, appreciated. The common law, based on the decisions of\r\nmen most eminent for wise insight and sound judgment, has always held\r\nthat combinations to restrict competition and establish a monopoly were\r\ncontrary to public policy, and the protection of the law has invariably\r\nbeen refused, whether they were combinations of labor or of capitalized\r\nindustries. The establishment of labor combinations, indeed, was long a\r\ncriminal offence, as we have pointed out more fully in the chapter\r\ndevoted to that subject. It must be said, too, that the principle has\r\ncome to be generally, though rather blindly, understood by the masses of\r\nmen. It is recognized, though perhaps not very clearly, that competition\r\nlowers the prices of goods, and that this benefits every consumer. Let a\r\nproposition to build a competing railroad line, or a competing\r\nelectric-light plant be submitted to popular approval, and, under the\r\nimpression that they are benefiting themselves, hard-working men will\r\ncheerfully assume heavy burdens of taxation to aid the new enterprise.\r\nSo blind and unreasoning indeed, is this popular abiding faith in the\r\nmerits of competition, that it has been responsible for some of the\r\ngreatest wastes of wealth in unproductive enterprises that have ever\r\nbeen known.\r\n\r\nWe have now examined the theory of universal competition as commonly\r\naccepted at the present day, and it is rightly considered a fundamental\r\nprinciple of society. It is the practice of most economic writers of the\r\northodox school to lay great stress on the importance of this\r\nfundamental principle, and enlarge upon its various manifestations. The\r\nmany attempts to limit and destroy competition, which we have studied,\r\nthey consider merely as abnormal manifestations which are opposed to\r\nlaw, and so not worth while considering very fully. But we have seen\r\nclearly to what extent the destruction of competition has gone on; and,\r\nwith this knowledge, the question almost inevitably occurs to us: Is not\r\nthis decay and death of competition, this attempt to suppress it under\r\ncertain conditions, too wide and general a movement to be treated as\r\nmerely a troublesome excrescence? Is it not likely that there are\r\ncertain fixed laws regarding competition which determine its action and\r\noperation, and sometimes its death? If this be so, it is of the highest\r\nimportance that we find and study these laws; and to that purpose we\r\nwill devote the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS OF MODERN COMPETITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far in our study, we have assumed that we knew what competition\r\nwas. Now, however, as we are to study it scientifically, we are in need\r\nof an exact definition, that we may know just what the term includes.\r\nProf. Sturtevant, in his \"Economics,\" says: \"_Competition is that law of\r\nhuman nature by which every man who makes an exchange will seek to\r\nobtain as much as he can of the wealth of another for a given amount of\r\nhis own wealth._\" Simmer this down to its essence, and we have simply:\r\n_Competition is selfishness._ To the other evident faults of the\r\ndefinition we need not allude. It is a much more satisfactory definition\r\nwhich Webster's Dictionary gives us, for it includes the idea that\r\ncompetition necessitates two or more parties to exercise it:\r\n\"_Competition is the act of seeking the same object that another is\r\nseeking._\" But this is too broad a definition for our purpose. It takes\r\nin competitions for fame, social standing, etc., with which we have\r\nnothing to do.\r\n\r\nFailing to find a satisfactory definition, let us make one, as follows:\r\n_Competition is that force of rivalry between buyers or between sellers\r\nwhich tends to make the former give a greater price for the commodity\r\nthey wish to secure, and tends to make the latter offer better\r\ncommodities for a less price._\r\n\r\nThat competition _is_ a force, even in the popular estimation, is\r\nevidenced by such common expressions as \"the pressure of competition,\"\r\n\"a strong competition,\" and indeed, \"the force of competition.\" But\r\nthese very expressions show us as well, what we have already found to be\r\ntrue in the preceding chapters, that it is not a constant force but a\r\nvariable one. What, then, are the laws of its variation?\r\n\r\nLet us see what we can learn by a study of three typical examples of the\r\nforce of competition. Let us take first the business of growing corn.\r\nThere are perhaps three million farmers in the United States engaged in\r\nproducing corn, and each one of these competes with all the others. Is\r\nthis doubted? We have defined competition as a rivalry that tends to\r\nmake the sellers offer better goods for a less price. Now at first sight\r\nit may seem that there is no rivalry at all. Neighboring farmers work\r\ntogether in all harmony; and no man thinks that because his neighbors\r\nhave raised a large crop of corn, he is in any way injured. And yet this\r\n_tendency_ to give better goods and lower prices exists and is plainly\r\nfelt. Suppose a new and superior variety of corn were introduced, which\r\nbuyers preferred. Some farmers would at once begin to raise it, so that\r\nthey might be more sure of a market and perhaps of a better price, and\r\nother farmers would be obliged to follow suit to meet the competition.\r\nAgain, consider that the supply and demand adjust themselves to each\r\nother through competition. For suppose, at the ruling price, the demand\r\nto be less than the supply; then to increase the demand, the price must\r\nfall; and the cause of the fall in price is simply that the farmers\r\ncompete with each other for the market, and lower their prices in order\r\nto secure a sale for their crops. Note, however, that the rivalry in\r\nthis case never becomes a personal one. Each farmer recognizes that an\r\nincreased supply lessens the price for his goods; but his neighbor's\r\nextra acreage is such a drop in the bucket, that he never thinks of it\r\nas being really a rival of his own crop.\r\n\r\nTake as a second example, the wholesale paper trade. Here are perhaps\r\nthree hundred men, each knowing personally many of his competitors and\r\nprobably hating some of them cordially. Each striving to secure for\r\nhimself all the trade possible, and to gain, if he can, his rivals'\r\ncustomers. He sends out his salesmen with instructions to, \"Sell goods!\r\nFor the best prices you can get, but sell them, anyhow.\" These\r\n\"drummers\" are sharp, active business men, they might well be employed\r\nin directing some productive process; but they go out and spend their\r\ntime in inducing customers by all the means in their power to buy their\r\ngoods. They spend money in various \"treats\" to secure the\r\ngood-fellowship of the man with whom it is desired to trade, and use his\r\ntime as well as their own. Another item of expense is for advertising\r\nand for keeping the firm name prominently before the purchasing public.\r\nAll these things cost money, as any wholesale merchant engaged in a\r\nbusiness where there is sharp competition can testify. It may be thought\r\nthat a firm which would have the courage to do away with all these\r\nexpenses and give the money thus saved to their patrons in reduced\r\nprices and better goods, would be able to keep its trade and even gain\r\nover its competitors. But it is hardly so; most men are more likely to\r\nbe wheedled into taking slightly inferior goods at a slightly greater\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nAnother matter to be considered in this connection is the variation in\r\nprice. In the case of the producers of corn, we saw that prices were\r\npractically uniform at any given place, being fixed by the ratio of\r\nsupply and demand in the chief markets of the world. But in making sales\r\nof paper, the sharp, close-dealing buyer is generally able to secure a\r\nbetter price than a buyer not posted in regard to the condition of the\r\npaper trade.\r\n\r\nAs competition becomes more intense, its burdens become more heavy to\r\ncarry. Perhaps two of the largest houses in the trade, who are able to\r\nforce prices lowest, come to a sort of tacit understanding that their\r\nsalesmen \"will respect each others rights a little and not force prices\r\ndown beyond all reason.\" It is plain that _here_ the foundation is laid\r\nfor the establishment of a monopoly. Yet the agreement certainly seems\r\nto be nothing more than these two firms have a right to make. Its result\r\nis seen, however, in a slight increase in the price their customers have\r\nto pay. Soon the tacit agreement becomes a formal one. Then other firms\r\nare taken in. The first seed has borne fruit. The combination grows\r\nlarger and stronger. The number of producing units is growing less.\r\nFinally it includes practically all the paper manufacturers in the\r\ncountry. Whoever wants paper must buy of the combination, there is no\r\nother source of supply. Competition is dead.\r\n\r\nIf the combination is strong enough and is managed well enough, it may\r\nbe permanent; and prices of paper will be regulated by other laws than\r\nthe law of competition. But suppose that the number of paper makers is\r\nso great and that they are so widely scattered that the combination\r\nproves difficult to maintain; local jealousies creep in, and charges are\r\nmade of partiality on the part of the managers. The combination finally\r\nbreaks up. Can we expect a perfect return to the old system of free\r\ncompetition? When men have once reaped the enormous returns that are\r\nyielded by the control of a monopoly, the ordinary profits of business\r\nseem tame and dull. There will surely be attempts to form the monopoly\r\nanew on a stronger and more permanent basis; and even if these attempts\r\ndo succeed in producing only short-lived monopolies, the effect will be\r\nto keep the whole trade and all dependent upon it in a state of disquiet\r\nand uncertainty. Prices will swing up and down very suddenly between\r\nwide limits; and it is everywhere recognized that _stability in price_\r\nis a most important element in inducing general prosperity. A perusal of\r\nthe trade journals for the years 1887 and 1888 will convince one of the\r\ntruth that when a combination is once formed, its members are loth to\r\ntry competition again. A considerable number of combinations which were\r\nformed in 1887 were soon broken up, often from the strength of old feuds\r\nand jealousies. But in almost every case they have been formed anew on a\r\nstronger basis after a short experience of competition.\r\n\r\nThis matter of the variation in price is a very important one, and it\r\nhas an important influence in checking business prosperity. Men are far\r\nless apt to engage in an enterprise, if they cannot calculate closely on\r\nprices and profits. But the main point, after all, is the waste which is\r\ndue to competition. It is for the interest of the public at large that\r\nthe papermakers should devote all the energies which they give to their\r\nbusiness to making the best quality of each grade of paper with the\r\nleast possible waste of labor and material.\r\n\r\nTake for a third example two railway lines doing business between the\r\nsame points. We have fully pointed out the practical working of this\r\nsort of competition in the chapter devoted to railways. It is plain that\r\nthe general effect is a fluctuation of rates between wide limits, an\r\nenormous waste of capital and labor, and ultimately, the permanent death\r\nof competition by the consolidation of the two lines.\r\n\r\nIn comparing now the above three cases, the most noticeable difference\r\nin the conditions is in the _number of competing units_. There were in\r\nthe first example three million competitors; in the second, three\r\nhundred; and in the last, but two.\r\n\r\nThe first difference in the competition which existed is in intensity.\r\nIn the case of the producers of corn, competition was so mild that its\r\nvery existence was doubted. In the case of the papermakers it was vastly\r\nmore intense, so that it caused those engaged in it to take steps to\r\nrestrict and finally abolish it. In the case of the railroads it was\r\nstill more intense, so that it was not able to survive any length of\r\ntime, but had to suffer either a temporary or permanent death very soon.\r\nLet us state, therefore, as the first law of competition, this: _In any\r\ngiven industry the intensity of competition tends to vary inversely as\r\nthe number of competing units._\r\n\r\nWe also saw that among the producers of corn there was virtually no\r\nwaste of energy from competition. Among the paper makers there was a\r\nlarge waste. And in the case of the railroads, the whole capital\r\ninvested in the rival railroad, as well as the expense of operating it,\r\nwas probably a total waste. Let us state, then, for a second law of\r\ncompetition: _In any given industry the waste due to competition tends\r\nto vary directly as the intensity._ As an additional example to prove\r\nthe truth of these laws, take the competition which exists between\r\nbuyers. In the case of ordinary retail trade the number of buyers is\r\nvery great, and the competition between them is so moderate that we\r\nhardly remember that it exists. It is difficult to see how there could\r\nbe any waste from this competition among buyers, at least of any amount.\r\nExpressed in the language of the laws we have found: The number of\r\ncompeting units is so great that competition is neither intense nor\r\nwasteful.\r\n\r\nFrom these two laws and a study of the examples we have given, it is\r\neasy to deduce a third. We have seen that when competition became very\r\nwasteful, monopoly arose; indeed, we have noted the working of this law\r\nall through our investigation. The principal cause assigned for the\r\nformation of the linseed-oil trust was the waste which intense\r\ncompetition had caused. The third law is, then: _In any given industry\r\nthe tendency toward the death of competition (monopoly) varies directly\r\nwith the waste due to competition._\r\n\r\nWe might now combine these three laws to deduce the fourth law, which\r\nis: _In any given industry the tendency toward the death of competition\r\n(monopoly) varies inversely with the number of competing units._ But\r\nthis law is also proved independently. Look back over all the monopolies\r\nwe have studied, and it will be seen that one of the most important\r\nconditions of their success was the small number of competitors. Fifty\r\nmen could be brought together and organized, and made to bury their\r\nfeuds and rivalries, when with a thousand the combination would have\r\nbeen impossible. We have seen, in the case of the farmers, how their\r\ngreat number alone has prevented them from forming combinations to\r\nrestrict the competition among themselves.\r\n\r\nIt should be said that these laws, like all other laws of economics,\r\nare not to be taken in a narrow mathematical sense. We cannot study\r\ncauses and effects dependent on the caprice of men's desires and wills\r\nwith the minute exactness with which we solve numerical problems. Taken\r\nin the broad sense, however, the study we have made in the preceding\r\nchapters is sufficient proof of their truth.\r\n\r\nThe common expressions of trade afford still further evidence. We often\r\nhear the expression: \"A healthy competition.\" But the very existence of\r\nthe phrase implies that there may be an unhealthy competition, and if\r\nso, what is it? Is it not that competition whose intensity is so great\r\nthat it causes a large waste of capital and labor in work other than\r\nproduction; whose intensity is so great that, like an animal or a\r\nmachine working under too great a load, it labors intermittently,--now\r\nacting with great intensity and forcing prices far below their normal\r\nplane, now pausing in a reaction, when a temporary combination is\r\nformed, and allowing prices to spring back as far above the point\r\nindicated by the relation of supply and demand; and finally reaching the\r\nnatural end for unhealthiness--death. In fact, a recent economic writer\r\ndeclares that especially intense competition should be called war, as,\r\nindeed, it frequently is called, rather than competition.\r\n\r\nLooking about us for other causes of variation in the intensity of\r\ncompetition we discover a fifth law: _The intensity of competition tends\r\nto vary directly in proportion to the amount of capital required for the\r\noperation of each competing unit, especially when the interest on the\r\ncapital invested forms a large proportion of the cost of production._\r\nTake, for example, the case of a railway line. All the capital invested\r\nin it is wasted unless the road is in operation. Hence it will be\r\nbetter to operate the road, so long as receipts are any thing more than\r\nthe expense of operation, than to abandon it. An enterprise in which no\r\ncapital is invested will cease operations when receipts do not exceed\r\nits expenditure and there is no prospect of betterment. But in the total\r\nexpense of operating a railroad, a large item is the interest on the\r\ncapital invested, which is as truly a part of the total cost of carrying\r\nthe traffic as is the daily labor expended in keeping the road in good\r\nrepair. (In railway bookkeeping only an arbitrary line can ever be drawn\r\nbetween capital account and operating expenses.) Now, in order to pay\r\noperating expenses and fixed charges, railways must secure traffic. We\r\nsuppose that they are doing this by competition, and that they have not\r\nyet combined to form a monopoly. Let us suppose that this competition\r\ncuts down receipts to a point where they are just sufficient to pay the\r\nwhole cost of carriage. In an enterprise in which no capital was\r\ninvested some of the competitors would be sure to fall out when profits\r\ndisappeared; but here there is no such chance of relief; and though the\r\ncompetition keeps on until the receipts are only enough to pay the\r\noperating expenses, still the road is not abandoned because then the\r\ncapital invested, in it would be a complete loss. Changes in productive\r\nprocesses often lessen the demand for a line of goods; but the owners of\r\nthe capital invested in factories and machines for making these goods\r\nmay often cause them to be continued in operation at a loss rather than\r\nlose all that they have invested, and because they hope for better days\r\nand a renewal of the demand.\r\n\r\nFor the sixth law of competition we have: _In any given industry the\r\ntendency toward the death of competition (monopoly) varies directly\r\nwith the amount of capital required for each competing unit._ This law\r\nis proven in part by the preceding laws; for when a large capital is\r\nrequired for each competing unit, the number of competitors will be\r\nsmall and the tendency toward monopoly will be strong; but it may also\r\nbe proven independently. Business men, before they form a combination,\r\nare certain to ask whether new competitors are likely to enter the field\r\nagainst the combination. Now, as we have seen in very many cases in the\r\npreceding chapters, when there is a great amount of capital required,\r\nnew competitors will be very unlikely to enter the field. If there is\r\nbut little capital required, they will be very apt to do so, being\r\ntempted by the prospect of large profits at the monopoly's prices. But\r\nthey know that the combination will concentrate its strength to fight\r\nthem in every way; and if they must invest a great deal of money in\r\nbuildings, plant, etc., to start operations, they will be apt to think\r\ntwice before they take the field against the combination.\r\n\r\nThe seventh law of competition is: _In any given industry in which\r\nnatural agents are necessary, the tendency toward the inequality of\r\ncompetition (monopoly) tends to vary directly with the scarcity of\r\navailable like natural agents._\r\n\r\nThe influence of limited natural agents in promoting the growth of\r\nmonopolies is a matter of the greatest importance. That the law is true,\r\nis evident upon slight investigation. For if some especial gift of\r\nNature is a necessity to any industry, and those who are engaged in that\r\nindustry can secure all the available gifts of Nature of that sort,\r\nthere is no opportunity for new competitors to enter the field.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that in this seventh law we have used in apposition\r\nwith the term monopoly, the term \"inequality of competition\" instead of\r\n\"death of competition,\" as in the preceding laws. We are now in need of\r\na definition of the term monopoly. Webster defines it as \"the sole\r\ncontrol over the sale of any line of goods\"; Prof. Newcomb says \"a\r\nmonopoly is the ownership or command by one or a limited number of\r\npersons of some requisite of production which is not solely a product of\r\nhuman labor\"; Sturtevant says \"a monopoly is such a control of the\r\nsupply of any desirable object as will enable the holder to determine\r\nits price without appeal to competition.\" To the first definition we\r\nobject that it is both narrow and indefinite. The second seems to omit\r\nsuch important classes of monopolies as the combinations to limit\r\ncompetition; and Sturtevant's definition is unscientific in this: Hardly\r\nany monopoly exists whose holders can without limit determine the price\r\nof its product. If the price continues to rise, competition in some form\r\nwill appear. Take, for example, the business of transporting goods from\r\nNew York to San Francisco; if all the railway lines combine to form a\r\nmonopoly, the competition of ocean steamers via Panama would eventually\r\nstop the rise in rates, if no other outside competition stopped it\r\nbefore. The owners of a rich mine have a real monopoly, though they\r\ncannot raise the price above a certain point without being undersold by\r\nthe owners of poorer mines or those more remote from market.\r\nConsideration of these facts lead us to construct the following\r\ndefinition: _A monopoly in any industry consists in the control of some\r\nadvantage over existing or possible competitors by which greater profits\r\ncan be secured than these competitors can make._ For the law of\r\nmonopolies we have: _The degree of a monopoly depends upon the amount of\r\nadvantage which is held over existing or possible competitors._ When the\r\nadvantage of the monopoly is so great that no other competitor will try\r\nto do business in competition with it, we may rightly say that\r\ncompetition is dead. The great share of the monopolies which are based\r\non this seventh law of competition, those due to the control of natural\r\nagents, only restrict competition by the attainment of an advantage over\r\ntheir competitors, and do not destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe principal natural agents which are necessary to production, and\r\nwhose supply may be so limited to cause an appreciable monopoly, are:\r\n(1) Land for agricultural purposes; (2) land for purposes of manufacture\r\nor commerce; (3) transportation routes, such as mountain passes, room\r\nfor railway tracks in a city street, or for gas-and water-pipes beneath\r\nits surface; (4) natural deposits of minerals and metals; (5) sources of\r\nwater supply or water power. (The latter is unimportant now compared\r\nwith a score of years ago, because of the lessened cost of its\r\ncompetitor, steam.)\r\n\r\nLet us be especially careful not to confound this seventh law of\r\ncompetition with a certain doctrine which is now receiving more and more\r\ncredence, which is, in brief, that the private ownership of the gifts of\r\nNature used in production should be abolished. The grounds in opposition\r\nto this doctrine we will discuss in a later chapter. The law we have\r\nstated says nothing of the right or wrong of the private ownership of\r\nthe gifts of Nature. What it does say is, that when any of these are\r\nlimited in amount, those who control them are given an advantage over\r\nother would-be competitors, which constitutes a monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn considering the natural agents enumerated above, we can easily see\r\nthe truth of the law. Agricultural lands, the most important of natural\r\nagents, are in this country so abundant that their rental is entirely\r\nfixed by competition. In England, where they are so much more limited in\r\narea, rent is fixed by custom. As regards land for purposes of\r\nmanufacture or commerce, we have already pointed out the cases in which\r\nmonopolies are prominent, as also for transportation routes. As regards\r\nmineral wealth, deposits of iron are so numerous and widespread that no\r\nmonopoly has ever yet succeeded in controlling competition in the\r\nmanufacture of pig-iron to any great extent. But the rarer metals, like\r\ncopper, tin, nickel, and others, are largely controlled by monopolies.\r\n\r\nNow, while this seventh law says nothing as to the right or wrong, the\r\nexpediency or inexpediency of the private ownership of natural wealth,\r\nit does follow from it that this private ownership generally constitutes\r\na monopoly, as we have defined it. For of no class of natural agents is\r\nit true that their richness and availability are absolutely equal. Those\r\ncompetitors who have the richest and best natural resources to work with\r\nhave an advantage over their competitors which is essentially a\r\nmonopoly. Thus the owners of fertile lands near a large city have an\r\nadvantage over the owners of less fertile lands far removed from\r\nmarkets, which is of a monopolistic nature. If any one doubts this, let\r\nhim say how this case is logically different from that of the ownership\r\nof a mine of native copper so near to New York City that the cost of\r\nlaying it down in the market there will be half what it is from any\r\nexisting mine; or, for a second case, take the New York Central railway,\r\nwhich has the control of such a valuable pathway between the Mississippi\r\nValley and the Atlantic seaboard that it has an advantage over all\r\ncompetitors in the business of transportation between those points.\r\n\r\nWe have now to turn our attention to other variations in competition\r\nbesides the variation in intensity. We need to distinguish the different\r\nspecies of competition. That competition which is in daily operation in\r\nmost branches of industry we may call _actual_ competition. That\r\ncompetition which would spring up in any industry in case an increase in\r\nprofits called it out, we may call _potential_ competition. The third\r\nclass is instanced in the letting to the highest bidder a franchise for\r\ncity water or gas-works, or street-car lines. Here competition acts at a\r\nsingle time to fix the price for perhaps twenty years. We may call this,\r\nfor want of a better name, _franchise_ competition. It possesses the\r\nevident advantage that it avoids both the waste of competition and the\r\nfluctuation of prices. It has the disadvantage that, unless the owners\r\nof the franchise are held strictly to their contract, quality is apt to\r\nbe sacrificed; also that if the purchase is for a term of years,\r\ncheapening in processes may result in undue profits to the franchise\r\nholders. The discussion of this matter, however, does not properly\r\nbelong to this chapter.\r\n\r\nArranging in their logical order the laws of competition which we have\r\nfound, we have the following diagram:\r\n\r\n  In any given industry the tendency toward monopoly increases:\r\n\r\n    (1.) As the waste due to competition increases.\r\n\r\n      The waste of competition increases in proportion to its intensity.\r\n\r\n        (1.) The intensity of competition increases as the number of\r\n             competing units decreases.\r\n\r\n        (2.) The intensity of competition increases with the amount of\r\n             capital required for each competing unit.\r\n\r\n    (2.) As the number of competing units decreases.\r\n\r\n    (3.) As the amount of capital required for each competing unit\r\n         increases.\r\n\r\n    (4.) As the number of available natural agents decreases.\r\n\r\nThe preceding diagram sets plainly before us the three great salient\r\ncauses from which have grown the long list of monopolies under which our\r\ncivilization labors. First, the supply of natural agents of which new\r\ncompetitors in any industry may avail themselves has been largely\r\nexhausted, or has been gathered up by existing monopolies to render\r\ntheir position more secure; the world has not the natural resources to\r\ndevelop that she had a century ago. Second, the concentration of all the\r\nproductive industries, except agriculture, into great establishments,\r\nwhile it has enormously lessened the cost of production, has so reduced\r\nthe number of competing units that a monopoly is the inevitable final\r\nresult. Last, the enormous capital required for the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of new competing units tends to fortify the monopoly in its\r\nposition and render the escape of the public from its grasp practically\r\nimpossible. These terse statements contain exactly the kernel of potent\r\ntruth for which we are seeking; MONOPOLIES OF EVERY SORT ARE AN\r\nINEVITABLE RESULT FROM CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe vital importance of this truth cannot be over-estimated. For so long\r\nas we refuse to recognize it, so long as we attempt to stop the present\r\nevils of monopoly by trying to add a feeble _one_ to the number of\r\ncompeting units, or by trying to legislate against special monopolies,\r\nwe are only building a temporary dam to shut out a flood which can only\r\nbe controlled at the fountain head.\r\n\r\nThe facts of history testify to the truth of this law. Monopolies were\r\nnever so abundant as to-day, never so powerful, never so threatening;\r\nand with unimportant exceptions they have all sprung up with our modern\r\nindustrial development. The last fifteen years have seen a greater\r\nindustrial advancement than did the thirty preceding, but they have also\r\nwitnessed a more than proportionate growth of monopolies. How worse than\r\nfoolish, then, is the short-sightedness that ascribes monopolies to the\r\npersonal wickedness of the men who form them. It is as foolish to decry\r\nthe wickedness of trust makers as it is to curse the schemes of labor\r\nmonopolists. Each is working unconsciously in obedience to a natural\r\nlaw; and the only reason that almost every man is not engaged in forming\r\nor maintaining a similar monopoly is that he is not placed in similar\r\ncircumstances. Away, then, with the pessimism which declares that the\r\nprevalence of monopolies evidences the decay of the nobler aspirations\r\nof humanity. The monopolies of to-day are a natural outgrowth of the\r\nlaws of modern competition, and they are as actually a result of the\r\napplication of steam, electricity, and machinery to the service of man,\r\nas are our factories and railways. Great evils though they may have\r\nbecome, there is naught of evil omen in them to make us fear for the\r\nultimate welfare of our liberties.\r\n\r\nTo the practical mind, however, the question at once occurs, what light\r\nhave we gained toward the proper method of counteracting this evil? Can\r\nit be true that the conditions of modern civilization necessitates our\r\nsubjection to monopolies, and that all our vaunted progress in the arts\r\nof peace only brings us nearer to an inevitable and deplorable end, in\r\nwhich a few holders of the strongest monopolies shall ride rough shod\r\nover the industrial liberties of the vast mass of humanity? Were this\r\ntrue, perhaps we had better take a step backward; relinquish the factory\r\nfor the workshop, the railway for the stage-coach. \"Better it is to be\r\nof an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide spoil with the\r\nproud.\" But the law we have found commits us to no such fate. We\r\ncannot, indeed, abolish the causes of monopolies. We cannot create new\r\ngifts of Nature, and it would be nonsense to attempt to bring about an\r\nincrease in the number of competing units and a decrease in the\r\ncapitalization of each by exchanging our factories and works of to-day\r\nfor the workshops of our grandfathers. But while monopolies are\r\ninevitable, our _subjection_ to them is not inevitable; and when the\r\npublic once comes to fully understand that _the remedy for the evils of\r\nmonopoly is not abolition, but control_, we shall have taken a great\r\nstep toward the settlement of our existing social evils. To discuss the\r\ndetails of the remedy, so far as it can be done in a volume of this\r\nsort, belongs properly to a later chapter. Before undertaking it,\r\nhowever, it seems well to devote some further attention to the evils\r\nwhich the attempt to abolish monopolies and adhere to the ideal system\r\nof universal competition has brought upon us, and to make, also, some\r\nfurther study of the general evils due to monopoly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nTHE EVILS DUE TO MONOPOLY AND INTENSE COMPETITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a strange thing when we come to analyze the various social evils\r\nwhich demand our attention, and which every true man longs to cure, to\r\nfind how great a proportion can be traced back to the one great evil of\r\nfaulty competition. As a preliminary to a survey of these evils, in\r\norder that we may understand the necessity that all good men and true\r\nshould exert themselves in applying the remedy, let us see just what\r\nconditions of our industrial society we should seek to work toward. What\r\nis the theoretical perfection of human industry?\r\n\r\nProbably all thinking men, whatever their belief and practice, will\r\nacquiesce in the proposition that the end we should aim to secure is\r\n\"the largest good to the greatest number.\" As we are discussing here\r\nonly economic questions, this means that the end to be sought is that\r\nthe largest number of people should have secured to them the greatest\r\npossible amount of the necessaries and comforts of life; or, more\r\nsimply, that the total of human happiness to be derived from the world's\r\nproduction of wealth should be the greatest possible. Now for our\r\npresent purpose we may assume that since all men desire wealth, the\r\ngreater its production, the greater will be the number of human desires\r\ngratified. From this it follows that our social organization should be\r\nsuch as to increase to the greatest possible degree the world's stock of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThere is no easier or safer way of studying questions of economics than\r\nto consider the community as a unit, and see what is for the interest of\r\nthe people as a whole; what conduces most to the \"common wealth\"; and if\r\nwe do this, whenever the question concerns production alone, the task is\r\nsimple, because the interests of the people as a whole are judged in the\r\nsame way as the interests of a single person. Whatever tends to increase\r\nthe total amount of wealth in the world, therefore, benefits the\r\ncommunity as a whole; and whatever diminishes the supply is an injury.\r\nAll work of every sort which tends to aid in the economical production\r\nof wealth and its transfer to the consumer is a benefit to the\r\ncommunity; and any thing which destroys wealth, lessens its production,\r\nor hinders men from exerting themselves to produce it, is an economic\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are we to say of the condition known as over-production? Is\r\nit not a fact that some lines of industry are so overdone that the\r\nproduction is far in excess of the demand, and is not this an evil\r\nrather than a benefit? Do not periods of business depression occur when\r\nall industries stagnate for want of a market for their goods? The true\r\nanswer to this question is: Over-production is not a fault of\r\n_production_, but of _distribution_. It is true that, in special\r\nindustries, a surplus of production sometimes occurs, due to\r\nover-stimulation, or too rapid growth; but over-production as commonly\r\nspoken of, refers to a general state of trade, in which demand for all\r\nsorts of goods seems to fall far below the market supply. But this lack\r\nof demand is not due to lack of desire. The desires of men are always\r\nin excess of their abilities to supply them; it follows, therefore, that\r\nthe condition known as over-production consists in a lack of _ability_\r\nto purchase goods rather than in a lack of _desire_ to purchase them.\r\nThis lack of ability has evidently to do with the distribution of wealth\r\nrather than its production.\r\n\r\nWhile it is easy to formulate laws to govern the theoretically perfect\r\nproduction of wealth, to whose justice all men will consent, we cannot\r\ngo far in the details of the ideal distribution of wealth without\r\nreaching points upon which the views of different parties are\r\ndiametrically opposed. Some foundation principles, however, let us\r\nstate, believing that in their truth the great majority of men will\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the theory of competition we saw that, if we conceived\r\nthe results of the labor of the whole community to be placed in a common\r\nstorehouse and gave to each man the right to draw from it an amount just\r\nequal to the benefit derived from the goods which he had placed within\r\nit, the ideal of a perfect system of distribution of wealth would be\r\nrealized. No human judgment, however, is, or ever can be, competent to\r\nmeasure the exact industrial benefits which each person confers upon the\r\ncommunity at large. We must inevitably permit men to measure the result\r\nof their own work by securing for it such an amount of the results of\r\nothers' work as they can induce them to give in exchange. But while we\r\ncannot measure exactly the benefit which each person confers, we can see\r\ncases in which the reward received is manifestly out of all proportion\r\nto the benefit conferred. Consider the fortunes which have been\r\naccumulated by some of our Midases of the present decade. It is quite\r\ncertain that the benefits which Cornelius Vanderbilt, for instance,\r\nconferred on the community by his enterprise and business sagacity, by\r\nhis work in opening new fields of industry, forming new channels for\r\ncommerce, etc., were so valuable that he honestly earned the right to\r\nenjoy a large fortune. It is equally certain that a great part of his\r\ngains had nothing whatever to do with any benefit conferred upon the\r\ncommunity, and that the fortune of $100,000,000 or so which he\r\naccumulated was an example of inequitable distribution of the products\r\nof the world's industry. Stating this in the form of a general\r\nprinciple, we should say: _The amount of wealth which any man receives\r\nshould bear some approximate relation to the benefit which he confers\r\nupon the world._\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that, by the law of supply and demand, the\r\nrewards of each worker are regulated in theory even more perfectly in\r\naccordance with our ideas of liberty than they could be on the basis of\r\nactual benefit conferred. For it is inconceivable that people would\r\nsubmit to pay for what was beneficial to them instead of what they\r\ndesired. A man who prefers to purchase wines instead of books with his\r\nsurplus money would think it a great injustice if he were prevented from\r\ndoing as he preferred with his own. But so long as every one is at\r\nliberty to use his income in buying whatever he desires most,\r\n_demand_--the willingness to pay money for the gratification of the\r\ndesire--will exist, and so long as demand exists it will be met by a\r\nsupply, furnished by those who are desirous of money and what it will\r\nbring. It is inconceivable, then, that any juster arrangement than this\r\nlaw of supply and demand can ever be practicable for regulating the\r\ncompensation of each individual. The man who can drive a locomotive will\r\nreceive larger wages than the man who shovels the earth to form its\r\npathway, because the supply of men competent to drive an engine is small\r\nin proportion to the number of men who are wanted for that work, while\r\nalmost any man can shovel dirt. Let us state, then, for our second\r\nprinciple: _The amount of wealth which any man receives should depend on\r\nthe ratio between the demand which exists for his services and the\r\nsupply of those able to render like service._ Farther than these\r\nstatements of the ideal principles governing the economical production\r\nand equitable distribution of wealth we need not go at present.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to examine the result of a violation of these principles\r\nin some of the crying evils of the present day which are wholly or in\r\npart due to the growth of monopoly and the waste of competition.\r\n\r\nEvery candid man will acknowledge that the enormous congestion of wealth\r\nin a few hands which exists to-day is a danger to be feared. We have had\r\nit constantly dinned in our ears that in this free land the ups and\r\ndowns of fortune were such that the rich man of to-day was apt to be the\r\nbeggar to-morrow; also that almost invariably a rich man's sons were\r\nreckless spendthrifts. These things, aided by the abolition of\r\nprimogeniture and entails, it was said, were to prevent the growth of a\r\nmoneyed aristocracy in this country. The propounders of this amiable\r\ntheory never explained how the community received reparation for the\r\ndestruction of wealth which the spendthrift sons were to carry on; but\r\nso long as the theory has failed to work in practice, that does not\r\nmatter so much.\r\n\r\nA few years ago it was a favorite occupation of newspaper paragraphers\r\nto estimate the Gould and Vanderbilt fortunes; but lately they seem\r\nto have given them up as beyond the limits of even their robust\r\nguessing abilities. Some idea of the latter's fortune may be gained,\r\nhowever, by realizing the fact that the Vanderbilt railway system now\r\nhas a total extent of nearly 12,000 miles, the total value of which can\r\nhardly be less than one thousand millions of dollars. Probably not less\r\nthan half of the securities of these companies are owned by the\r\nVanderbilt family, and it is well known that their investments are by no\r\nmeans confined to railways. The important fact is, that this fortune\r\ngrows so fast now that it is sure to increase; and will double itself\r\nevery fifteen or twenty years, because all that its owners can spend is\r\nbut a drop in the bucket toward using up their income. But this fortune,\r\nwhile the largest which is still under one name, is but one of many\r\nenormous ones. The names of Gould, Flagler, Astor, Rockefeller,\r\nStanford, Huntington, and a host of others follow close after the\r\nVanderbilts. In the days of our grandfathers, millionaires were no more\r\nplentiful than hundred-millionaires are to-day.\r\n\r\nWe have next to show the present and prospective evils which result from\r\nthis congestion of wealth. The first and most obvious one is its injury\r\nto the remainder of the people of the country, by the diversion from\r\nthem of wealth which they have rightfully earned and which they would\r\nreceive were it not for the tax of monopoly. It is obvious that a\r\ncertain amount of wealth is annually produced by the industry of the\r\ncountry from which the whole wants of the country must be supplied. This\r\namount may be greater, indeed, when a Gould or a Flagler or a Crocker\r\ndirects the enterprise; but for the most part it is indisputable that\r\nthe owners of these colossal fortunes have made them, not by any\r\nstimulus of the production of wealth by their owners, but by a\r\ndiversion of the produced wealth in the general distribution from\r\nothers' pockets to their own. In short, all other men are poorer that\r\nthese many times millionaires may be richer. To show how these fortunes\r\nhave in many cases been obtained, I cannot do better than to quote a\r\nwriter not at all likely to err by undue severity to our millionaires,\r\nas he is himself the president of a railway system a thousand miles in\r\nextent:\r\n\r\n     The great majority of the phenomenal fortunes of the day are the\r\n     result of what may be called lucky gambling.... Man is a gambling\r\n     animal by nature, and modern methods have enormously developed both\r\n     its facilities and its temptations and have opened large fields in\r\n     which gambling is not held to be disreputable.\r\n\r\n     Under such stimulus is it wonderful that its growth has been\r\n     phenomenal? Wall street is its head-quarters, and millions upon\r\n     millions of dollars are accumulated there to meet the wants of the\r\n     players. Railroad stocks are its favorite cards to bet upon, for\r\n     their valuation is liable to constant fluctuation on account of\r\n     weather, crops, new combinations, wars, strikes, deaths, and\r\n     legislation. They can also be easily affected by personal\r\n     manipulations.... Money makes money, and money in great masses has\r\n     its attractive power increased. The aspect of phenomenal fortunes,\r\n     therefore, is a social problem of some importance. Their manner of\r\n     growth and their manner of use are to be observed, and what\r\n     restrictions, if any, should be placed on their accumulation should\r\n     be considered.[5]\r\n\r\n      [5] \"Railway Practice.\" By E. P. Alexander, President Central\r\n      Railroad and Banking Co. of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe fact pointed out by General Alexander in the above quotation is one\r\nwhich is far too lightly appreciated. The evils of railway management by\r\nwhich the owners of the stocks and bonds of the company are victimized\r\nto enrich stock speculators are much too complex and numerous to be\r\ndescribed here. The state of affairs can be briefly summed up, however,\r\nwith the statement that our present system of conducting corporate\r\nenterprises results inevitably in the gravitation of their ownership\r\ninto the hands of the holders of large fortunes. The railways of the\r\ncountry are an instance in point. Time was when the stocks and bonds of\r\nrailways were owned by people of small means all over the country. But\r\nafter many severe lessons in the shape of stocks wiped out, and bond\r\ninterest scaled down, these small holders were taught the folly of\r\ninvesting their savings in business over which they had practically no\r\ncontrol, and thus placing them at the mercy of irresponsible corporate\r\nofficers. Broadly speaking, the railway property of the country is owned\r\nby men worth their millions; and the small holdings are being rapidly\r\nabsorbed every day. But the case is not true of railways alone.\r\nTelegraph lines, telephone, and electric light plants, our mines, and to\r\na large extent our factories, which were once held by private owners,\r\nare now controlled by corporations whose shares are quoted on the\r\nexchanges and are consequently subject to a forced variation, dictated\r\naccording as \"bull\" or \"bear\" has the ascendancy. And when the ownership\r\nof a property is once brought into this channel, it is no longer a\r\nsuitable investment for the man of small means. It is the prey of men\r\nwho practically make bets as to what its future price will be, and\r\nmanipulate the price, if possible, to win their bets. If it is ever\r\nagain held for investment simply, it is when it is locked in the safe of\r\nsome modern Croesus.\r\n\r\nWe have shown now the extent to which the congestion of wealth has gone.\r\nWe have shown that other men are poorer that these men may be richer. We\r\nhave explained that these great fortunes have been made, not by\r\nlegitimate enterprise, but largely by \"lucky gambling.\" And finally we\r\nhave seen how the transfer of each enterprise to the control of stock\r\nspeculators adds it eventually to some already overgrown fortune. The\r\nconnection with the subject of the present volume is obvious. The\r\ncotton-seed oil mills of the South, once held by private owners, are now\r\nin the hands of a trust whose certificates are quoted on the\r\nstock-exchanges, and are held only by men of large capital, or by stock\r\ngamblers. This is a typical example of the change which is everywhere\r\noccurring. Private enterprise gives way to the stock company, and that\r\nin turn gives way to the trust. The salient fact, then, we may express\r\nin similar terms to those of our first law of competition, as follows:\r\n_The congestion of wealth tends to increase inversely with the number of\r\ncompeting units._\r\n\r\nThe facts we have stated make it impossible for the greater monopolies\r\nto defend themselves, on the ground that their profits inure to the\r\nbenefit of any great number of people. But this is not an innocuous\r\nstate of affairs. It is one of serious injustice and evil. The workman\r\nwho struggles hard to save a hundred dollars a year can receive only a\r\npaltry three dollars and a half of interest or less, if he deposits it\r\nin a saving-bank. But the capitalist who is clearing a hundred thousand\r\na year may make twice or thrice that interest from his investments. In\r\nshort, the charge is: That monopoly and intense competition, with the\r\nvariation in price which they cause, have shut out the small capitalists\r\nof the country from the ownership of the most profitable sorts of\r\nproperty; and by confining them to other lines, have decreased their\r\npossible income from their investments.\r\n\r\nA further evil resulting from the congestion of wealth is what is\r\ncommonly spoken of as over-production. We are confronted of late years\r\nwith the strange spectacle of factories and mills shut down for months\r\nat a time, of markets which, at various times, are glutted with every\r\nsort of commodity. All sorts of causes are given; all sorts of remedies\r\nare suggested and tried. Where is the true one? With the exception of a\r\nfew special cases, the fault is not that there are no people who want\r\nthe goods. Probably ninety-nine families out of every hundred would buy\r\nmore if they had the money to buy with. In many cases the lack of money\r\nto buy with is due to the fact that the bread-winners are out of\r\nemployment because of the glutted markets and idle mills. In this way\r\nthe evil tends to perpetuate itself and grow worse. Now combine this\r\nfact with the fact that the holders of monopolies are in the receipt of\r\nincomes so great that, in many cases, they are quite unable to spend\r\nthem. Also, that this income is largely locked up to wait the chance of\r\nprofitable investment, or is used in speculation. Is it not obvious,\r\nnow, that the reason why people cannot afford to purchase the goods,\r\nwith which the storehouses are glutted, is that too large a proportion\r\nof profits has been diverted to swell fortunes already enormous? Have we\r\nnot in this way accounted for a large amount, at least, of the\r\nover-production which is throwing out of employment thousands of\r\nworkmen, rendering useless a vast amount of valuable capital, and\r\naffecting from time to time the business of the whole country with a\r\nveritable paralysis?\r\n\r\nThe facts bear out this theory. For, at many times when producers in\r\nevery industry are complaining of dull times because people who buy have\r\nno money to spend, there is an abundance of money to be had for\r\ninvestment. Fortunately, the evil seen from this aspect must, to a\r\ncertain extent, be but a temporary one, and will tend to work its own\r\ncure. For as the world's stock of invested wealth continues to grow,\r\nthere is less opportunity for its profitable investment in improving\r\nundeveloped natural resources. The greater portion of our wealth we save\r\nand invest, the faster will the rate of interest tend downward. But, as\r\nthis occurs, the operators of mills and mines have to pay less out of\r\ntheir receipts as interest on their borrowed capital, and can,\r\ntherefore, pay more to their workmen.\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which monopoly works to cause over-production,\r\nwith its attendant evils. Suppose a trust is formed in some\r\nmanufacturing industry, where the working capacity is just equal to\r\nsupplying the demand. The first work of the trust is to raise the prices\r\nperhaps 20, 30, or 40 per cent. Of course this causes a falling off in\r\nthe demand, and the trust has to shut down some of its mills to ward off\r\nover-production. The true cause of over-production in this case is, that\r\nthe prices are not in equilibrium with the relation between supply and\r\ndemand. Let prices come down, and the demand will increase. The working\r\nof this special case gives us an idea of the way in which general\r\nover-production is caused. For it is well known that monopolies have\r\nraised the prices and reduced the consumption not of one, but of\r\nhundreds of articles. If the men who are made idle by the\r\nover-production in these industries flock into other occupations to\r\nsecure work, they reduce wages there; so that, in any case, their\r\npurchasing power is reduced, and this tends to perpetuate and increase\r\nthe evil. Of course it is not pretended to claim that all industrial\r\ndepressions have been due to over-production, or the local congestion\r\nof the world's income. But that a large part of it may be justly laid to\r\nthis cause, seems to be beyond question.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that the congestion of wealth is very largely due to the\r\ngrowth of monopoly, and we have discussed the more immediate evils that\r\nresult from this congestion of wealth. But when we attempt to describe\r\nthe evils and abuses which follow close after, as a result of the power\r\nwhich monopoly has placed in the hands of a few, we may well pause at\r\nthe task. The whole array of perplexing social problems comes before us,\r\nand we realize more and more what a curse monopoly has become. The\r\nphilanthropist tells us that poverty, and all the distresses that follow\r\nin its wake, are largely due to the fact that our workingmen under\r\npresent conditions _must_ live from hand to mouth, _must_ rely on\r\ncharity for aid in every emergency, and _must_, therefore, decrease in\r\nmanliness and self-reliance and the ambition to better themselves, as\r\nthe practical impossibility of success is comprehended.\r\n\r\nGood men are lamenting because the Church has, to a great degree, lost\r\nits hold on the laboring classes, and are casting about on all sides for\r\na remedy. Will they ever find one as long as the wage-worker carries in\r\nhis bosom a rankling sense of injury done him? Injury which he feels\r\nthat the Church is merely seeking to drug with charity instead of\r\nwishing to cure it with justice? There is great need that the Church,\r\nnot alone by the sermons of its most enlightened thinkers, like Dr.\r\nHeber Newton, but by the daily practice of the rank and file of its\r\nmembership, should recognize, as it never yet has done, the great\r\nprinciples of human fraternity, and move intelligently and earnestly to\r\nremedy the great evils that menace us.\r\n\r\nEven the evil of intemperance can be traced back to a connection with\r\nmonopoly. Who shall blame the tired laborer, if after a week with sixty\r\nhours of unremitting toil, he takes refuge from the dreariness and\r\nlassitude of physical exhaustion, the hopelessness of ambition-quenched\r\nlife, and perhaps the discomforts and disquiet of the place he calls\r\nhome, in a long draught of that which does, for the time, create in him\r\nan image of exhilaration, strength, self-respect, and manhood? It is but\r\nan image, indeed, and to all but the victim it is a caricature; but when\r\na man cannot hope for the reality, to only imagine for a brief hour that\r\nhe is indeed a king of men, and that care and woe and degradation are no\r\nlonger his lot, is a refuge not to be despised.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a class of philanthropists who say, with some truth,\r\nthat the laboring classes as a whole have now more than they will spend\r\nfor their own good, and declare that higher wages means merely more\r\nspent on sprees and debasing sports, of different sorts but universally\r\nharmful. On the other side, the wise philanthropists who are trying to\r\nhelp their fellow-men in that best of all ways, by teaching them to rely\r\non themselves, testify that their efforts to make men independent are\r\nlargely hampered because it is so extremely difficult for a workingman\r\nto live in any other way than from hand to mouth, especially in our\r\nlarge cities. The true solution seems to be that all these reforms must\r\ngo hand in hand. We must teach men how to make nobler uses of their\r\nincomes and themselves, while we endeavor to bring about reforms that\r\nshall give them greater comforts and more leisure to use for either\r\nself-improvement or self-debasement.\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said of the indirect effects which result from the\r\ntaxation which monopolies inflict upon the community for their own\r\nprofit; but they are now so generally realized and understood that we\r\ncan devote our time more profitably to the investigation of other evils.\r\n\r\nUnder the ideal system of competition which we studied in Chapter X., we\r\nfound that all occupations were competing with each other; so that if,\r\nfrom any cause, one calling became especially profitable, men would\r\nflock to it and bring down the profits to a normal point. Monopolies\r\nhave seriously interfered with this important and beneficent law. How\r\noften do we hear the complaint of the great difficulties that beset\r\nyoung men on their first entrance to business or industrial life in\r\nsecuring a situation. The monopolized industries shut out new\r\ncompetitors by every means in their power. The trade-unions limit the\r\nnumber of apprentices which shall be allowed to learn their trade each\r\nyear. The result is, first, a most deplorable tendency to idleness on\r\nthe part of young men just at the time when they should be most active;\r\nand, second, a still larger increase of men in the professions and\r\nnon-monopolized callings, tending to still further increase the\r\ncompetition in those callings, where returns are already inferior to\r\nwhat they should be. Surely, we must begin to appreciate how vitally\r\nimportant to every person in the land is this matter of competition and\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nThe evils which we have thus far considered pertain to the distribution\r\nof wealth. Let us now turn our attention to the production of wealth.\r\nOur second law of competition stated that the waste due to competition\r\nvaried directly as its intensity. We have frequently referred to this\r\nwaste of competition; let us now inquire more fully concerning its\r\namount and effect. In the first place, however, let us settle the\r\nquestion, once for all, that waste or destruction of wealth of any sort\r\nis an economic injury to the community. We have, indeed, already\r\nexplained this in the first paragraphs of the chapter; but while all\r\nauthorities on economics agree on this point, the general public is\r\nstill seriously infected with the fallacy that waste, destruction, and\r\nunprofitable enterprises are beneficial because they furnish employment\r\nto labor. If this were merely a theory, we could afford to ignore it;\r\nbut the trouble is that it is acted upon, and works untold evil and\r\ndamage to the world. To take a typical case, people reason that damage\r\ndone by flood or fire or storm is not a total loss because employment\r\nwill be furnished to many in repairing and rebuilding after the\r\ndevastation. They do not stop to reflect that so much wealth has been\r\nwiped out of the world, and that _instead of the destruction furnishing\r\nso much additional employment, it has only changed the direction of the\r\nemployment_. For money nowadays is always spent, either directly, by its\r\nowners, or by some one to whom he lends it. And wherever money is spent\r\nit furnishes employment. Therefore, if the money which was used in\r\nrepairing and rebuilding had not been required for that work, it would\r\nhave been spent in some other direction and furnished employment to\r\nlabor there. Understanding, then, that the economic interests of the\r\ncommunity are best served when each one of its members exerts his\r\nenergies with the greatest result and with the least waste in producing\r\nwealth, let us see to what extent intense competition and monopolies\r\nhave violated this law.\r\n\r\nIn his interesting book entitled \"Questions of the Day,\" Prof. Richard\r\nP. Ely, of Johns Hopkins University, refers to the building of two great\r\nrailways with closely paralleled roads already in operation, the Nickel\r\nPlate, and the New York, West Shore and Buffalo, and says:\r\n\r\n     \"It is estimated that the money wasted by these two single attempts\r\n     at competition amounts to $200,000,000. Let the reader reflect for\r\n     a moment what this means. It will be admitted that, taking city and\r\n     country together, comfortable homes can be constructed for an\r\n     average of $1,000 each. Two hundred thousand homes could be\r\n     constructed for the sum wasted, and two hundred thousand homes\r\n     means homes for one million people. I suppose it is a very moderate\r\n     estimate to place the amount wasted in the construction of useless\r\n     railroads at $1,000,000,000, which, on the basis of our previous\r\n     calculations, would construct homes for five millions of people.\r\n     But this is probably altogether too small an estimate of even the\r\n     direct waste resulting from the application of a faulty political\r\n     economy to practical life. When the indirect losses are added, the\r\n     result is something astounding, for the expense of a needless\r\n     number of trains and of what would otherwise be an excessively\r\n     large permanent force of employés must be added. Of course, nothing\r\n     much better than guesswork is possible, but I believe that the\r\n     total loss would be sufficient to provide a greater portion of the\r\n     people of the United States with homes.\"\r\n\r\nBut it seems quite possible to make a closer estimate of the wealth\r\nwasted by the construction of unneeded railways than the general one\r\nabove. There are now, in round numbers, 158,000 miles of railway in the\r\nUnited States. The two lines named above have a total extent of nearly\r\n1,000 miles; and while they are the most flagrant examples of\r\nparalleling in the country, there is no small number of other roads in\r\nvarious parts of the country which, except for their competition with\r\nroads already constructed, would never have been built. Considering the\r\nfact that the paralleling has been done in regions where the traffic\r\nwas heaviest and where the cost of construction was greatest, it seems a\r\nconservative estimate to say that 5 per cent. of the capital invested in\r\nrailways in the United States has been spent in paralleling existing\r\nroads. But the total capital invested in the railways of the United\r\nStates is about $9,200,000,000, 5 per cent. of which is $460,000,000. It\r\nis also to be remembered that this 7,500 miles of needless road has to\r\nbe maintained and operated at an average expense per mile per annum of\r\n$4,381, or a total annual cost of nearly $33,000,000. Taking Prof. Ely's\r\nestimate of $1,000 as the cost at which an average size family can be\r\nprovided with a comfortable home, and we find that the cost of these\r\nunneeded railways would have provided 460,000 homes, sufficient to\r\naccommodate 2,300,000 people. Say that 3 per cent. of the cost of these\r\nhomes is required annually to keep them in repair, then this could be\r\nfurnished by the $33,000,000 now paid for the operating expenses of\r\nneedless railways, and an annual margin of about $19,000,000 would be\r\nleft, or enough to provide each year homes for nearly 100,000 more\r\npeople in addition. Of course, this is merely a concrete example of what\r\npossible benefits we have been deprived by wasting our money in building\r\nneedless railways.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the money we have spent on unprofitable railways,\r\nas well as those totally useless, has wrought us an amount of damage far\r\nin excess of their actual cost. It is generally agreed by financiers\r\nthat the periods of industrial depression during the past score of years\r\nhave been largely due to excessive railway building. For in a period of\r\nactive railway construction, roads are built whose only excuse for\r\nexistence is that they will encroach upon the territory of some rival.\r\nThe capital invested fails to make a return. The loss of income which\r\nensues decreases the purchasing power of the community; and this\r\ncombines with the sudden loss of business confidence caused by the\r\nfailure of the enterprise to bring about a general panic and crash which\r\naffects the whole community; and by checking enterprise and industry,\r\ndamages the country ten times the amount of the original loss.\r\n\r\nThe waste of competition is by no means confined to railways. The Sugar\r\nRefiners' trust has raised the price of sugar and thus reduced its\r\nconsumption so much that they have permanently closed several of their\r\nfactories. Yet Claus Spreckels is now building a great refinery in\r\nPhiladelphia, the output of which is to compete with the trust. All this\r\ncapital invested in that which is not needed by the community is an\r\ninjury to the public. The French Copper syndicate so raised the price of\r\ncopper that it became profitable to work old mines of poor ore, which\r\nunder ordinary circumstances could not be worked at all at a profit.\r\nCapital was expended in opening and refitting these mines, and in\r\npreparing them for working; while other mines, able to produce the metal\r\nat much less cost, were reducing their output because of their contract\r\nwith the trust.\r\n\r\nIn various cities of the country, millions have been wasted in tearing\r\nup the streets to bury the unneeded mains of competing gas companies.\r\nThe electric light competitors are stringing their wires over our heads\r\nand beneath our feet, and by covering the same district twice or three\r\ntimes, double and treble the attendant evils as well as the cost.\r\n\r\nThe waste due to intense competition in trade may be avoidable or\r\nunavoidable; but it is certainly of enormous magnitude, although the\r\nfact of its being a waste is still little appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe waste due to labor monopolies is much better understood. The strikes\r\nwhich paralyze industry and send want and distress in ever widening\r\ncircles are universally recognized to be a waste of wealth whose annual\r\namount is enormous. The cost to employers and workmen of the strikes in\r\nthe State of New York in 1886 and 1887, was $8,507,449. Reckoning from\r\nthis as a basis, it is probable that the total annual cash cost of\r\nstrikes in the United States is twenty or twenty-five million dollars.\r\nThe results of these strikes in decreasing the purchasing power of\r\nemployés and thus causing overproduction, and in discouraging enterprise\r\nand increasing the cost of capital, serve to spread their effect\r\nthroughout the whole industrial community and thus cause an actual loss\r\nand injury many times that borne by the parties directly engaged.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that the waste due to the intense competition which\r\nthe concentration of productive enterprise has brought about in modern\r\ntimes is a matter of startling proportions. We are wasting and\r\ndestroying wealth all the time sufficient to go a long way towards\r\nabolishing all the poverty in our midst; and the blame for this state of\r\naffairs we are now able to place where it belongs.\r\n\r\nSurely with a full appreciation of these evils, every honest and\r\npatriotic man must be willing to use every endeavor to strike at the\r\nroot of the evil. The public indeed is, and has long been, a unit in its\r\nopposition to monopoly; but in endeavoring to defeat monopoly it has\r\ntaken just the course which could give no permanent gain. Cities have\r\nbeggared themselves to aid competing railway lines only to see them\r\nconsolidated eventually with the monopoly which it was expected to\r\ndefeat. The multitude regard Claus Spreckels as a benefactor--and will\r\ntill he forces the Sugar Trust to divide their 25 per cent. profits with\r\nhim in return for the control of his refinery.\r\n\r\nIt is no benefit to us if in steering away from the Scylla of monopoly,\r\nwe be wrecked on the Charybdis of wasteful competition. We have been\r\ntrying for a score of years now to defeat monopolies by creating\r\ncompetition; but in spite of a universal public sentiment in favor of\r\nthe reform, and notwithstanding the millions of wealth which we have\r\npoured out like water to accomplish this object, monopolies to-day are\r\nfar more numerous and powerful than ever before. The people who are\r\ngroaning under their burden of oppression are anxious for relief. The\r\nremedy they have so long and faithfully tried to apply has but made a\r\nbad matter worse; and it is small wonder that, despairing of other\r\nrelief, they are adopting false and injurious plans for bettering\r\nthemselves which serve merely to extend the monopoly policy into all\r\nindustrial affairs.\r\n\r\nWe are threatened with a state of society in which most of the principal\r\nindustries will be wholly given over to monopoly. Those in each\r\noccupation will band together to secure the greatest returns for\r\nthemselves at the expense of all other men; while the few occupations\r\nwhich cannot thus combine in a monopoly--farming, and the different\r\nsorts of unskilled labor--will be filled to overflowing with those\r\ncrowded out of other callings. Those who follow them will do so only\r\nbecause the monopolized occupations are closed to them. Thus will our\r\nfarming population degenerate into a peasantry more miserable than that\r\nof Europe, and our laborers be ground down to a level lower than they\r\nhave yet known. Is there a probability that such a state of affairs will\r\ncome to pass? There might be if the public were not keenly alive to the\r\ncurse of monopoly. But as it is, the greater danger is that through\r\nignorance a wrong course may be adopted for the cure of our present\r\nevils, which will aggravate instead of curing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nAMELIORATING INFLUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf pure selfishness were the only motive influencing the masses of\r\nmankind, the evils which we have considered in the preceding chapter\r\nwould be wholly unbearable. All men would be waging an industrial\r\nwarfare with each other in their greed for gain, just as the barons of\r\nfeudal times fought to satisfy their thirst for power and possessions;\r\nand as motive is the great force which determines character, we would\r\nbe, as far as moral excellence is concerned, in the same category as the\r\nuncivilized savages.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the happiness of the race, there are important\r\ninfluences at work counteracting, modifying and ameliorating the social\r\nevils that threaten us. These influences are not cures for these evils,\r\nthough they are so considered by very many people. But they are very\r\nimportant palliatives. They are certainly of inestimable value in the\r\nlack of real remedies; but it is better to consider them as palliatives\r\nmerely; for necessary, as they are and always will be, to soften and\r\nrelieve the ruggedness of human laws and human administration of law, in\r\nthe present condition of humanity they cannot effect a cure of the evils\r\nwhich burden us.\r\n\r\nThe first of these palliatives has a purely selfish origin. It arises\r\nfrom the desire of the managers of every monopoly to make the greatest\r\npossible profit from its operations. Let us take, for example, a street\r\nrailway monopoly which is at liberty to charge such rates of fare as it\r\nchooses and which has no competitors. If it fixes its fare at 10 cents,\r\nvery many people will prefer to walk or take some other mode of\r\nconveyance, who, if the fare was at 5 cents, would patronize the road.\r\nThus it may very likely happen that 5-cent fares will yield it the\r\ngreatest net income. It is often said that it is competition which has\r\nbrought our rates of railroad transportation down to their present low\r\npoint. While this is largely true, it is also true that the tendency to\r\nfoster the growth of traffic by making a low tariff has been a large\r\nfactor in bringing rates down to a reasonable point. Another example of\r\nthis principle's operation is in the case of monopolies protected by the\r\npatent laws. In this case the collection of only a moderate royalty will\r\ngenerally result in greater profits to the inventor than he would secure\r\nby exacting a large fee, because of the greatly increased sales in the\r\nformer case.\r\n\r\nIt should not be understood, however, that this principle has its only\r\napplication in cases similar to the two mentioned. There is hardly an\r\nindustry, monopolized or competitive, into which it does not enter to\r\neffect important results. It is to be noted, however, that it is least\r\neffective where the demand for the monopolized article is least\r\nsensitive to a variation in price. This fact should be considered by\r\nthose who are fond of arguing that this principle alone is always\r\nsufficient to prevent monopolies from doing much harm. While it is\r\npowerful in the case of such monopolies as we have mentioned, where the\r\ndemand for the commodity furnished varies greatly with the price, in the\r\ncase of the great copper trust or of the quinine trust or of any\r\nmonopoly controlling the great staples of human consumption, it seems\r\nplain that it can have little effect. Nor do we need to base our proof\r\nthat this principle is not a sufficient remedy upon this ground alone.\r\nGrant it to be true that a certain monopoly makes the greatest net\r\nprofit when its rates or prices are at a certain point; then will it not\r\nbe apt to set them slightly above that point, where they will give\r\nnearly the same profit with a considerable decrease in the volume of\r\nbusiness transacted and in the corresponding labor and responsibility?\r\nAnd, again, the point where it makes the greatest net profit is\r\nconsiderably above the point where it is of the greatest possible\r\nbenefit to the community at large. This latter end is attained when it\r\nuses its facilities to their full capacity for the benefit of the\r\npublic. The rates should be fixed at such a point that this full\r\ncapacity will be utilized, or as much higher as may be necessary to pay\r\nthe monopoly a fair profit on its operations.\r\n\r\nThis influence just considered has its origin in the selfishness of men.\r\nThe second, and by far the most important influence tending to\r\nameliorate the evils due to monopolies and intense competition arises\r\nfrom that essentially noble trait of human character whose province it\r\nis to seek the welfare of others before that of self. It is not to be\r\nwondered at that the large benevolence of our noblest Christian thinkers\r\nrebels against the inflexible laws of competition, or rather at their\r\nstern application to modern conditions of life. Under our social system,\r\nindeed, each man is striving to do his utmost to benefit his fellow-men,\r\nbut only so far as it benefits himself. Christianity goes far beyond\r\nthis. It teaches the Fraternity of Man, the Fatherhood of God, and thus\r\nthe duty of all men to care for and love their brothers' happiness and\r\nwelfare. It is in accord with the noblest and most exalted desires of\r\nthe human soul. It teaches a man to seek to benefit others for their own\r\nsake, not for the sake of the reflex benefit on himself.\r\n\r\nThe burden of Christ's sermon on the mount was that golden rule of\r\naction, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to\r\nthem\"; and the whole of his teachings glow with the spirit of\r\nfraternity; the strong bearing the burdens of the weak; the rich cast\r\ndown and the poor exalted; brother sharing with brother, according to\r\ntheir needs. We are accustomed to make ourselves complaisant with the\r\nreflection that these were figurative expressions, and not meant as\r\nliteral commands. But if we consider candidly, we must confess that if\r\nit is the spirit of its Master's commands which the Church means to\r\nfollow, it is very far, as a body, from reaching up to their full\r\nimport. The love for one's fellow-men which Christ taught was certainly\r\nmeant to be expressed in great, noble acts of brotherly kindness.\r\nConsider the want, the suffering, the distress, the misfortune, the\r\ninequality by which a thousand families have hard work and scanty fare\r\nwhile one revels in luxury. Are these thing repugnant to the spirit of\r\nChristianity, or not? Every one knows that they are. It is because\r\nChristian men in these days are prone to follow their own ease in common\r\nwith the rest of the world, and are accustomed to make their Christian\r\ncode of morals to fit that which public opinion declares to be\r\nsufficiently advanced, that Christianity as a remedy for social evils\r\nhas fallen into disrepute with the laboring classes. But men, both in\r\nand out of the Church, who are better informed as to the grand and noble\r\nspirit that lies at its foundation, are coming to look more and more\r\ntoward Christianity as the only deliverance from the evils that threaten\r\nus.\r\n\r\nOur social system, say the devout among these men, is based on the\r\nselfish desires of men, their wish to get the most for themselves with\r\nthe least service to their fellow-men. It is inconceivable that a system\r\nfounded on any thing less than the noblest attributes of humanity can be\r\nintended as a permanent basis for society. The system founded on\r\ncompetition was adapted to the conditions of men during the formative\r\nperiod of civilization: but modern inventions, processes, and methods\r\nare revealing a strange want of elasticity in its action. It is leading\r\nus to such grave evils that men everywhere are looking for an escape\r\nfrom it. We are brought face to face with the fact that the law of\r\ncompetition, the cruelly terse \"survival of the fittest,\" was never\r\nmeant to control the wondrously intricate relations of the men of the\r\ncoming centuries. And if selfishness is not to control, it is because\r\nunselfishness is to reign in its stead. It is because there will grow up\r\nin the hearts of men a fraternal love, such as the world has not yet\r\nseen, which will make them gladly share a common inheritance with each\r\nother, as they do a common Fatherhood. Men will then labor for others'\r\nwelfare as now; but each with the thought of others' benefit, not of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nNor are these men alone in their belief. Earnest thinkers outside of the\r\nChurch, who are familiar with the evils which intense competition and\r\nextortionate monopoly are constantly pushing into our notice, discern a\r\ntendency in our social organism to pulsate with stronger and more rapid\r\nbeats in its convulsions of strike and boycott and commercial crisis.\r\nAnd in these mighty vibrations, like the swing of a gigantic pendulum,\r\nthere is danger that it may swing so hard and so far as to break its\r\ncontrolling bonds and leave humanity in chaos.\r\n\r\nAnarchy means more than the reign of individualism. It means such a ruin\r\nof the world's wealth, the storehouses and fields and factories which\r\nsupply its wants, that nine tenths of the population of the globe would\r\nbe swept off its face by actual starvation. Some social organism there\r\nmust be if our civilization is to continue. What can adjust the delicate\r\nrelations of man to man when the bond of selfishness which holds us\r\ntogether breaks? There are many men, even now, whose greatest desire and\r\nstrongest purpose is to benefit their fellow-men; and if we can extend\r\nand strengthen this noble principle so that it will govern the great\r\nmass of humanity, why may we not cease to measure and bargain and weigh\r\nwith our brother men?\r\n\r\nSuch is the argument for what we may appropriately call Christian\r\ncommunism. Who shall say what shall be possible with a new and nobler\r\ngeneration of men? When the great mass of the race has Altruism for its\r\ngoverning motive, then it may be possible to use that trait of character\r\nas the basis of industrial society. But to-day the governing motives of\r\nmankind are largely selfish. Society must govern men in their dealings\r\nwith each other, not by arbitrary force but by their inner motives of\r\naction. When men at large begin to heartily desire to benefit others\r\nmore than themselves, then the system of selfish competition will begin\r\nto disappear, and the system of fraternal devotion will arise to take\r\nits place. This will come about naturally. It will be an effect which\r\ncan only be brought about by producing the cause. When Christianity\r\nshall have so regenerated mankind that its governing motives are noble\r\nand generous, then the social problems we are discussing, as well as\r\nmany others, will be forever happily solved.\r\n\r\nEvery one will say, God speed the attempt to implant such noble motives\r\nin the breasts of men; but we recognize at the same time the vast change\r\nwhich must be wrought before mankind at large will reach this high\r\nstandard; and in the centuries which will be required to effect this, we\r\nmust have other forces to govern society. Thus, while not denying the\r\npossibility that the Christian principle of Altruism may be the final\r\nsolution of the problem of society, it seems best for us to regard it at\r\nthe present day as what it is,--an influence tending to smooth over the\r\ninequalities and soften the asperities of our social system, and to\r\ntransform the warfare of competition into a peaceable and friendly\r\nemulation.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to overestimate the valuable work which this Christian\r\nprinciple of human fraternity is thus doing at the present day. It is\r\nrecognized in many ways so common that we cease to think of them as what\r\nthey are--expressions of the common brotherhood of man. Our vast public\r\ncharities supported by law are an instance. It is recognized now by all\r\ncivilized countries that it is a duty for the State to care for those\r\nwho are so poor or unfortunate as to be unable to care for themselves.\r\nPrivate charities, too, are as much more enormous now than they were a\r\ncentury ago as private fortunes are, compared with those of that day. In\r\nfact, beneficence has come to be recognized as an important duty of the\r\nvery wealthy; and churches, schools, hospitals, and the like bear\r\nwitness everywhere to the benevolence of wealthy men. All this public\r\nand private benevolence has certainly accomplished wonderful results in\r\nrelieving the want and misfortune of men, and making their lot a\r\nbearable one.\r\n\r\nThe above beneficences require outright giving; but there are many ways\r\nin which the fraternal spirit of men works to cause men to treat each\r\nother in business affairs more liberally than they would if competition\r\nwere the only governing motive. In very many cases of the employment of\r\nlabor, the wages paid are higher than the rate which competition alone\r\nwould fix. It is true that this is largely due to a selfish motive. The\r\nmen are more contented and industrious than when their wages are lower.\r\nThere are always plenty of applicants for any vacant position. The men\r\nare not prone to find fault with their pay, knowing that plenty would be\r\nglad to fill their places. At the same time, it is certainly true that\r\nin many cases a principal motive for giving higher wages is the desire\r\nto be liberal and generous with the workers whose labor brings income\r\nand profits. Again it is very frequently the case that mills and mines\r\nare kept in operation in dull times, when goods must be sold at a loss,\r\nif sold at all, simply to keep the employees from the destitution and\r\nsuffering consequent upon idleness. Cases of especial personal\r\nbenevolence are still more common. There are tens of thousands of\r\nworking people to-day rendering service whom their employers well know\r\nto be unprofitable servants, but who are retained because their youth or\r\nage or incapacity renders them proper objects of assistance in this way,\r\na sort of charity far better than outright gift.\r\n\r\nIn business enterprises, again, the spirit of fraternity is widely\r\ndiffused. As we have seen, it has been one principal cause of the\r\nformation of trusts and combinations to limit and restrain competition.\r\nThere are also a growing number of enterprises which are purely\r\nphilanthropic, such as the provision of cheap and healthy homes for\r\nworking men and women.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of business, too, public opinion does not approve of the\r\nman who exacts the utmost farthing, and weighs and measures to the\r\nclosest fraction. The most grasping creditor, who precipitates the ruin\r\nupon the bankrupt, and the landlord or money-lender, who exacts\r\npitilessly and turns a deaf ear to the call of a brother for mercy, are\r\nalso condemned at the bar of public opinion.\r\n\r\nThese and many other considerations lead us to some knowledge of the\r\ninestimable value of the principle of fraternity to correct the harsh\r\nand inequitable working of the industrial organism. It remains only to\r\nbe said that in this sphere of action its influence is but a small\r\nfraction of what it ought to be and what it promises to become.\r\n\r\nIt is through their conscience, as well as through their innate sense of\r\njustice and right, that men are coming to see how the extortion by\r\nmonopolies and the waste of competition in which they have engaged are\r\nan injury to the common weal and an expression of might rather than of\r\nright. It is in this way that we are beginning to discern the faults and\r\nimperfections of our present industrial system and to recognize that\r\nprogress toward better things is to be found by recognizing, not\r\ncovering, these faults, and doing all in our power to remedy them. In\r\nthis work the Christian Church should be in the lead; and a large\r\nproportion of its pastors, accustomed to an earnest and sympathetic\r\nappreciation of social evils, are among the foremost to second the\r\nefforts of modern reformers. Of the rank and file of the Church,\r\nhowever, it is to be regretfully said that they are eminently\r\nconservative; and that, with very many notable exceptions, they are\r\ncertainly not in the lead in the efforts to equalize the injustices\r\nwhich have grown up under the laws of competition. It is largely because\r\nthe course of Christians is in this respect so inconsistent with their\r\nprofessed belief in that grand doctrine of man's divine origin and\r\nuniversal brotherhood, that the Church, is losing the respect of the\r\nlaboring classes. Nor will it regain that respect until it shows by\r\nunmistakable evidence to the men who toil with their hands that it is\r\nalive to the questions of the day,--alive to the injustice of society\r\nto-day; and that the love of the Church's great Master for their souls\r\nis echoed by a longing in the hearts of his followers for their temporal\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nBut it should be also said that, save as they assume it, the\r\nresponsibility of those within the Church is not greater than of those\r\nwithout. All men alike are brothers; and it is more, far more, than a\r\nselfish tie that binds us together in civilized society. Legal rights\r\nare based largely on the system of competition under which our\r\nindustries have grown up; but the moral duties of all men go far beyond\r\nthis. It is the duty of all men alike to supplement the working of the\r\nlaw of selfish competition with the acts of a fraternal love for the\r\nwelfare of all men. Too much stress cannot be laid on this. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that if it were not for the charity and beneficence and for\r\nthe strong spirit of humanity, which lives in a strange strength, even\r\nin the hearts of the debased and evil-minded, the industrial warfare\r\nwhich our modern competition has come to be would have wrought tenfold\r\nmore evil than it has, and would have already arrayed class against\r\nclass with other weapons than those of peaceable industry. May Heaven\r\ngrant that the time shall never come when the growth of the principle\r\nof human fraternity shall not far outstrip and overtop the growth of\r\nhuman selfishness, whatever forms the latter may take.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter it seems eminently proper to call attention\r\nto one practical application of this great principle of fraternity which\r\nought to go a great way towards saving us from the results of mistakes\r\nin our attempts to remedy the evils which have grown up. The fraternal\r\nprinciple should lead men to judge charitably the men who are engaged in\r\nmonopolies and in wasting the world's wealth in intense competition. The\r\nmore especially as _these evils are due, not to the malignity of any\r\nperson, but to our system of industry, which causes them to spring up_.\r\nThe investigation which we pursued in the first chapters showed very\r\nclearly that monopolists are simply striving, like all other men, to\r\nprotect and advance their own interests by what they consider legal and\r\nhonorable means. And our study of the laws of competition has shown us\r\nthat the evils of monopoly and unhealthy competition are the natural\r\noutgrowth of the great revolution in modern industries by which the\r\nnumber of competing units has been reduced from many to few.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is a great tendency to make these evils worse by\r\nrecrimination. It is very common to hear those engaged in monopolistic\r\nenterprises, whether as owners or managers, denounced as unscrupulous\r\nvillains, double-dyed rascals, scoundrelly enemies of the people, or\r\nperhaps in terms less blunt but more scathing. Now, what are the facts\r\nof the case? Speaking broadly, it is a fact that the men who own and\r\nmanage our modern monopolies are as a class far more large-hearted in\r\ntheir sympathies than the average of men. It is only because they do not\r\nrealize the consequences of their acts that they seem to those who do\r\nrealize them and those who suffer by them to be incomprehensibly brutal.\r\nThe same man who at a corporation meeting may do his part toward\r\nthrowing a thousand men out of employment or wasting a million dollars\r\nof the world's wealth to effect some monster \"deal,\" may stop as he\r\nleaves his office to help a crippled beggar regain his feet; and when he\r\nhears of the destitution that his own official act has helped create, he\r\nwill give with a lavish hand to relieve it. When we come to questions\r\nbetween labor and its employers, more than this is true. The employers\r\nof labor as a class are closely in sympathy with the honest desire of\r\ntheir men to better themselves, and the constant increase in the\r\nemployment of arbitration to settle difficulties, the experiments in\r\nco-operation and profit-sharing, and the furnishing of cheap and good\r\nhouses to the workers are all evidences of this fact.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that it is circumstances, not men, which have created\r\nmonopolies. For to tell the truth, there are but very few men who, if\r\nput in the place of the stigmatized monopolists, would not have done as\r\nmuch or more, as their abilities permitted, to achieve a fortune as have\r\nthese men. All men strive in general to make as much as possible out of\r\ntheir fellow-men, and to gain the most possible with the least labor.\r\nThe monopolist only goes further on this road than most other men can\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a still more common error exists with reference to\r\nthe monopolies of labor. The newspaper press seems strangely fond of\r\nrepeating the statement that all labor organizations are kept up by idle\r\nand turbulent labor agitators, who wish to live off the proceeds of\r\ntheir fellows' labor. A little candid thought and investigation will\r\nconvince any one that this is an out-and-out lie, and as such deserves\r\nthe condemnation of all honest men. Granted, indeed, that labor\r\nmonopolies are an evil, as we have fully shown, and that the men who\r\nhave charge of them are far from perfect, and make many mistakes, they\r\nhave far more to excuse them than have the men who form monopolies for\r\nthe purpose of adding to fortunes already plethoric. The truth is, that\r\nif the men who are so incomprehensibly unjust in their estimate of the\r\nwork of labor organizations were put in the place of the laborers at the\r\nbench or in the mill, they would be foremost in securing their own\r\nrights by organizing their fellow workmen. It would be a great thing for\r\nthe world's peace if men would try to look at their brother's failings\r\nthrough their brother's eyes. Before you criticise a man too harshly,\r\ncandidly consider whether you would do any better if you were in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWe hear much said of the folly and wickedness of stirring up and\r\nreviving the sectional animosity between the North and the South; and\r\nall patriotic men rejoice in burying past issues and inaugurating the\r\nera of a united nationalism. But those who, by personal attacks upon\r\nmonopolists, whether they are millionaire monopolists or hard-handed\r\nworkingmen, cultivate animosity and hatred between social classes\r\nalready too widely separated and too prone to hostility, are sowing seed\r\nwhose fruit may be reaped in a social strife far more destructive and\r\nfatal than any sectional strife could be. In discussing remedies for the\r\nevils we have been investigating, we should always keep the fact in mind\r\nthat our remedy should seek, not to punish, but to cure. Personal or\r\nclass enmities never yet helped the world to advance. It will be\r\nfortunate if men can be taught to see how useless such enmities are in\r\nthis case; and how little revenge and reprisal can ever do to heal a\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR THE EVILS OF MONOPOLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now investigated the nature of all the different classes of\r\nmonopolies and combinations for the suppression of competition. We have\r\nstudied their working and their effect upon the different classes of\r\nsociety. We have discussed the foundation principles of civilized\r\nsociety as seen in abstract theory and as seen in the actual practice of\r\nto-day, with the evils which intense competition on the one hand and\r\nextortionate monopoly on the other have brought upon us. Finally, we\r\nhave considered the influences which tend to lessen and ameliorate these\r\nevils, and the extent to which we may rely on them to benefit the\r\ncondition of society. We are now fully prepared to consider the remedies\r\nwhich are proposed for these evils, and to see in what direction our\r\nhope lies for the improvement of the condition of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt would be a far larger task than we propose to attempt, however, to\r\ndiscuss all the schemes which have been proposed for bettering the\r\ncondition of society. They have been numerous ever since the dawn of the\r\nidea of popular liberty, have accompanied it all through its centuries\r\nof growth, and to-day, despite the fact that the amount of the comforts\r\nof life accessible to the masses of the people is far greater than ever\r\nbefore, plans for further betterment of the condition of society, the\r\nmore economical production and equitable distribution of wealth, are\r\nbeing pressed forward and advocated more strongly than ever. Nor does\r\nthis fact furnish any ground for pessimism. We shall have far more\r\noccasion to deplore when men become so conceited over the advancement\r\nwhich the race has already made,--so numb to the evils which still\r\noppress them,--that they will no longer take part in the agitation of\r\nplans for further advancement.\r\n\r\nIn considering now the plans proposed at the present day by those who\r\nwish to remedy the evils of monopoly, we shall find it profitable to\r\nconsider first two great opposing principles, which we will designate as\r\n_individualism_ and _societism_. Upon one or the other of these\r\nprinciples almost every scheme for bettering the condition of society is\r\nbased.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of individualism has for its foundation the absolute\r\nindustrial liberty of each individual. By this is meant that every\r\nperson shall have \"the free right of contract,\"--that is, the right to\r\nsell his labor or property or purchase that of others as he chooses. It\r\nholds that in all matters where the production and distribution of\r\nwealth is concerned, the desire of each man to advance his own interests\r\nwill, alone, in the long run, result in the highest good to the greatest\r\nnumber. It asks the government to \"let alone\" the industrial affairs of\r\nthe country, and leave private enterprise to take its own course. Its\r\nadherents are fond of asserting that each man knows his own wants and\r\ncan direct his own business affairs much better than any government can\r\ndirect them for him. It declares that free competition is the best\r\npossible agent to regulate all industrial affairs, and it ascribes all\r\neconomic evils to the fact that free competition has been thwarted or\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe opposing doctrine of societism holds that the waste in the\r\nproduction of wealth and the inequities in its distribution, which\r\nafflict mankind to-day, are due to the extreme application of the\r\ndoctrine of individualism. Its adherents analyze competition and declare\r\nit to be but another expression of a law of savage nature, tersely\r\nexpressed as \"the survival of the fittest.\" A system which brutally\r\nforces the weaker to the wall, say they, is unfit to govern the\r\ninter-relations of civilized human beings. Condemning thus the\r\nprinciples and practice of their opponents, they would go to the\r\nopposite extreme and place the control of the production and\r\ndistribution of wealth in the hands of organized society or of local and\r\ncentral governments, to be by them administered for the common benefit.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious commentary upon these two opposing doctrines\r\nis that either of them is impracticable; and that if either of them were\r\ngiven the entire control of our industries, the whole people would unite\r\nin condemning it. Lest there should be any mistake as to what is meant\r\nby this, it is well to say that we now refer to neither the\r\nindividualism nor the societism which is practically advocated at the\r\npresent day, but rather to the essence of the two opposing principles.\r\n\r\nTo see most clearly the practical failure of either of these principles\r\nwhen applied without modification by the other, consider our present\r\nsocial system, which is based on both individualism and societism. If\r\nthe principle of individualism were to be fully applied and societism\r\nwere to be entirely abolished, a first step would be the relinquishment\r\nby the government of all the enterprises it now carries on; and they\r\nwould be left for private enterprise to take up or leave alone as it\r\nchose. This means, for one thing, to bring the matter plainly home, that\r\nthe whole national postal system would be wiped out, and we should\r\ndepend on some private company or companies to collect, carry, and\r\ndistribute our mails. The government would also abandon all its work in\r\nkeeping clear and safe the natural waterways of the country, as well as\r\nall the harbors, light-houses, etc. Municipal governments would give up\r\nall their systems of water supply to private companies, as well as their\r\nsewerage systems, and even paving, street cleaning, etc. Indeed, the\r\nmaintenance of our whole system of highways would be given over to\r\nprivate enterprise. Is this too much? It is only a legitimate\r\napplication of the principle that government should leave to private\r\nenterprise all matters connected with commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nLittle need be said to prove that a similar application of the principle\r\nof societism to our industrial system would result even more\r\ndisastrously. As a general thing, the necessary formality and expense of\r\nadministration when business is carried on by the government, causes the\r\nfinal cost of production to be much greater than under private\r\nmanagement, even when conducted with all honesty. But the chief reason\r\nwhy the principle of societism is impracticable and unwise for universal\r\napplication, lies in the fact that the men who administer our\r\ngovernments are neither the wisest nor the most honest of men. The\r\ncompetition among those engaged in private business tends by a process\r\nof natural selection to bring the men of greatest business ability into\r\ncontrol of affairs. But by any form of government yet tried, popularity\r\nrather than merit, and excellence in the arts of the politician, rather\r\nthan experience and capacity as a statesman and business man, are the\r\nqualities which place men in positions where they can control public\r\naffairs. Not that very many wise and good men do not now hold office,\r\nand that many unprincipled and vicious men do achieve success in private\r\nbusiness. But, as a general rule, the statements just made hold good.\r\n\r\nIt seems plainly apparent, then, that neither the principle of\r\nindividualism nor the principle of societism can be taken as an\r\ninfallible guide for determining the control of our industry. It would\r\nbe as manifestly unwise to take a step toward abolishing existing\r\nsocietism by placing our postal department under the control of a\r\nprivate company, as it would be to make a move toward abolishing\r\nindividualism by having the government assume the management of all the\r\nfarms in the country. Both of these principles are necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, a marked tendency toward an increased reliance on the\r\nprinciple of societism as civilization progresses and our life becomes\r\nnecessarily more intense and complex. A community of plain farmers,\r\nisolated from each other, can live their individual lives about as they\r\nplease, without any interference of the government becoming necessary to\r\nprotect the rights of each man from infringement by his neighbors. But\r\nthe resident in a large village must submit to certain restrictions for\r\nthe common good. He must not carry on any kind of business likely to\r\nbecome a public nuisance. His cattle may not graze in the streets. He\r\nmust give part of his earnings toward maintaining a water supply for a\r\nprotection against fire. The citizen of a great city is subject to far\r\nmore restrictions. The government assumes the control of education,\r\ncharities, the care of the public health, the drainage of the streets,\r\nthe collection of offal, and a multitude of other duties which in a less\r\nintense civilization each family performs for itself.\r\n\r\nThe advance in science and the arts, too, has brought about a revolution\r\nwhose effect we must recognize. A hundred years ago almost every\r\ncommunity, and to a large degree every family, was industrially almost\r\nindependent of every other, as we have already shown. To-day each man\r\nrelies on a million others to supply him with the commonest necessaries\r\nof life. The armored knight was proof against all foes, save the few\r\nantagonists similarly clad. To-day my life is dependent on the fidelity\r\nand vigilance of ten thousand men, and every man I meet has me in his\r\npower. Given the malignant will and fiendish cunning necessary, and one\r\nsingle man can kill a thousand human beings and destroy a million\r\ndollars at a blow. To sum up, each advance in civilization makes men\r\nmore dependent upon each other, and increases the advantage and\r\nnecessity of having industries most important to the common welfare\r\ncontrolled by society as a whole instead of by individuals.\r\n\r\nIt is contended by some that from the increased interference of\r\ngovernment with private affairs, there is danger that the liberties of\r\nthe people will be curtailed, and that their rights will be so hedged\r\nabout by restrictions that the result will be evil instead of\r\nbeneficial. To this it must be answered that the people themselves are\r\nthe source of the government's authority and power of restriction, and\r\nthat in no case will a restriction of the government be long maintained\r\nwhich does not benefit far more in conserving the rights of men than it\r\ninjures by infringing them. Apply this rule to any case of government\r\naction in industrial matters. A city government, for instance,\r\nconstructs a system of sewerage. All taxpayers must contribute something\r\ntowards its expense, and their right to spend that money in such other\r\nways as they choose is abridged; but, at the same time, the more\r\nimportant right of having healthy and safe drainage for their houses is\r\nconserved. In a similar way, the government may pass laws of various\r\nsorts to restrict and control what seems to be at first sight purely\r\nprivate business, such as the sale of explosives, spirituous liquors,\r\npoisons, drugs, and many other articles. In every instance, this is done\r\non the ground that the interference of government is necessary to\r\nprotect the rights of the community as a whole, even though the\r\nliberties of certain classes are abridged.\r\n\r\nThe study of these facts brings to our attention an important principle\r\nof governmental action, which should always be remembered when in any\r\nindustrial matter we find that the principle of individual action is\r\nproducing unsatisfactory results, and conclude, therefore, to ask the\r\ngovernment to take some part in its control. This principle is as\r\nfollows: _government, as the representative of the will of the whole\r\npeople, should in general, attempt the regulation, or control, of\r\nindustrial matters only to benefit the people as a whole_.\r\n\r\nOf course it cannot be said that all government action for the benefit\r\nof special classes of the community is wrong. The granting of pensions\r\nto those defenders and upholders of the government who deserve it, is a\r\ncase in point where special legislation is justifiable and proper; and\r\nmany other cases exist. Nevertheless, the shaping of legislation to\r\neffect the interests of special classes of the community is one which is\r\nnow working the nation serious injury; and it has obtained so firm a\r\nbold that it will take a long time for us to throw it off. It causes men\r\nof all classes to consider the government as a paternal benefactor,\r\nwhose duty it is to aid them, either in their schemes for getting rich\r\nor their struggles to earn a living; when its real office is to protect\r\nall citizens in their individual rights, undertake only such industrial\r\nenterprises as can manifestly be better and more economically conducted\r\nby it than by private enterprise, and enforce restrictions upon industry\r\nonly as they are needed to protect personal rights or the interests of\r\nthe community as a whole. Worst of all, the use of government to advance\r\nspecial interests places a premium on the efforts of those who seek to\r\ncorrupt the expression of the popular will in its every stage, from the\r\nvoters at the polls to the chief rulers in the seats of government. For\r\nby combining to accomplish their mutual purposes, they are able to turn\r\naside all departments of government from their legitimate work and\r\noccupy them with measures to advance special interests, some commendable\r\nenough, others a mere excuse for stealing from the public treasury, but\r\nall alike claiming attention and action, while the business of the\r\npeople goes all awry.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed necessary to thus briefly discuss these two opposing\r\ntheories of society, individualism and societism, in order to show the\r\nimpracticability of either when applied to the society of to-day without\r\nlimitation and modification by the other; and that in adopting or\r\nrejecting any remedies that may be proposed for the industrial evils\r\nwhich we have discussed, we should be guided by the facts as we find\r\nthem, and not by blind adherence to abstract principles.\r\n\r\nLet us now gather up the salient decisions which we have reached in all\r\nour past investigation. We have discovered that a great industrial\r\nrevolution is in progress, by which manufacturing, mining, and\r\ntransportation to a very great extent, and other industries to a\r\nconsiderable extent, have been and are being concentrated in the hands\r\nof a very few competitors. We have found that by the laws of competition\r\nthis reduction in the number of competitors greatly increases the\r\nintensity of competition and the resulting waste and instability of\r\nprice, and finally brings monopoly into existence. This monopoly we have\r\ndetermined to be a serious infringement on the rights of the people, and\r\nwe have found that the losses due to intense competition and the\r\nfruitless attempts to defeat monopoly by adding new competing units have\r\nwasted the wealth of the nation in uncounted millions. We are now to\r\nconsider the remedies proposed for these evils.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious remedy for monopoly, and the one which has been tried\r\nand persevered in with the most remarkable faith, is _the creation of\r\nnew competitors_. Does a railroad monopoly oppress us? Build a competing\r\nline. Is the gas company of our city charging us $3 per thousand for gas\r\nwhich cost but 50 cents to produce and deliver? Let us start another gas\r\ncompany and tear up all our pavements again to lay its mains. Has the\r\nsugar trust put up the price of sugar two cents per pound? Well, \"sugar\r\ncan be produced anywhere by the expenditure of labor and capital,\" the\r\nTrust's lawyers say, and so _we_ will \"trust\" that some enterprising\r\nmanufacturer will take the field against the combination. But if we do\r\nany of these things, we have added only _one_ competitor to the number\r\nin the field. And with only _two_ competitors in the field, competition\r\nis sure to be so _intense_ and _wasteful_ that the formation of a new\r\nmonopoly is a matter of but a short time.\r\n\r\nThis is the conclusion to which the theory brings us; and the more one\r\nstudies the history of actual attempts to create competition in this\r\nway, the more thoroughly convinced he must be that the inevitable result\r\nwill be the same,--the tacit or formal combination between the old\r\nmonopoly and the new competitor, resulting in the re-establishment of\r\nthe absolute reign of monopoly. The author has thoroughly studied the\r\nactual working of hundreds of schemes, in every part of the United\r\nStates, whose object was to create competition in railroad\r\ntransportation. It is a most astonishing fact to see the eagerness with\r\nwhich thousands of municipalities, all over the country, which have\r\ntaken great loads of debt upon their shoulders to secure \"competing\r\nlines,\" and have seen these lines swallowed up by their rivals, are\r\nstill anxious to repeat the folly and assume new burdens to aid in\r\nbuilding new lines, which will inevitably be absorbed like those which\r\nthey preceded. If the people as a whole learn wisdom by experience, they\r\nseem to learn with painful slowness. The first great lesson for the\r\npeople who are groaning under the burden of monopoly to learn, then, is\r\nthat when we try to defeat monopoly by creating new competing units, the\r\nremedy is worse for the community at large than the disease, and effects\r\nat best but a temporary relief.\r\n\r\nAnother class of remedies against monopoly seek to accomplish their\r\npurpose by opposing the tendency to a reduction in the number of\r\ncompeting units. There are not wanting people who, having gained a dim\r\nperception that monopolies are an inevitable result of the modern\r\nconcentration of industry, conclude that, after all, \"the former days\r\n_were_ better than these,\" and that our wisest course is a retrograde\r\none. Fortunately, however, these people are comparatively few. It is a\r\nfact so plain that even the dullest can hardly fail to perceive it, that\r\nthe consolidation and concentration of industry which have gone on\r\neverywhere have wonderfully cheapened the cost of production,--made it\r\npossible for us to make better goods with a less expenditure of labor\r\nand material. The revolution in our industries could not be undone\r\nwithout a more radical action toward vested property rights than could\r\nbe countenanced now; and as already seen, it would work to the detriment\r\nof every person in the community. We cannot go back to the stage-coach,\r\nthe workshop, and the hand-loom of our ancestors; we cannot, if we\r\nwould, undo the growth of a century in civilization; and it is well that\r\nit is so.\r\n\r\nBut while most men see the benefit which has resulted from the\r\nconsolidations already effected, there are but few who are not opposed\r\nto further consolidations. It is argued that the reduction in the number\r\nof competing units results in increasing the intensity of competition,\r\nwhich is assumed to be a desirable end; and that it has also worked\r\ngreat benefit in the reduction in cost. Having attained this, it is\r\nproposed to stop further consolidations and prevent the establishment of\r\nmonopoly. This is what most of the present plans for giving relief from\r\nmonopoly propose to accomplish. Certainly the task is no easy one; let\r\nus inquire if it be even possible.\r\n\r\nWe may safely assume, in the first place, that the competitors in any\r\nindustry will always be reduced to a very small number before the public\r\nwill be sufficiently aroused to make any movement for the prevention of\r\nconsolidation. So long as a monopoly is not imminent, usually, indeed,\r\nso long as it is not in actual operation, no one cares or notices how\r\nfar consolidation and combination goes. Now by the laws of competition,\r\nwhen the number of competing units is small, competition is intense and\r\nwasteful, and acts to so reduce the returns from industry that\r\ncombination and the establishment of a monopoly are a natural sequence.\r\n\r\nEvidently this result can only be prevented by some interference outside\r\nthe industry itself. If we allow it to take its own course, a monopoly\r\nis certain, sooner or later, to be formed. But the only agency which has\r\nthe right and power to interfere is government. The question then is,\r\ncan government successfully interfere to prevent intense competition\r\nfrom bringing about monopoly? In order to do this it must of course keep\r\ncompetition in action; but it cannot do this directly. Competition is\r\nessentially a strife. No law was ever enacted which could force two men\r\nto fight if they were really determined to be at peace. No law was ever\r\nenacted which could force two manufacturers or merchants to compete with\r\neach other in price, if they really were agreed to sell at the same\r\nprice. The common-law principle that contracts in restraint of\r\ncompetition are void, so often appealed to nowadays, has really but\r\nslight power. It merely prevents the parties who make an agreement to\r\nrestrain competition, from enforcing such agreements in court. Attempts\r\nhave also been made to apply this principle to secure an annulment of\r\nthe charter of corporations which engage in monopolistic combinations.\r\nEven if this be successful, the only result probable is that private\r\nparties instead of corporations will carry on the monopolies in a few\r\ncases, while in most cases the competition-destroying agreements will be\r\nmade so secretly that it will be impossible to prove their existence.\r\n\r\nIt is thus plain that the action of the government in declaring the\r\nrestriction of competition to be illegal is wholly ineffectual to check\r\nthe growth of monopoly. And, further, the fact is that it is hardly\r\npossible for the government to take any more extreme stand in the\r\nmatter. Let us suppose that it does declare, not only that these\r\ncombinations are against public policy, but that they shall be punished.\r\nThen would it be a punishable offence for two country grocers who had\r\nbeen selling sugar below cost to agree that henceforth they would charge\r\na uniform price and make an eighth of a cent per pound! It is to be\r\nremembered that _competition_ necessitates _action_. Can the government,\r\ntherefore, _compel_ a man to compete, to cut prices below his neighbors,\r\nor to carry on his business at all, if he does not choose to do so? Such\r\na law would establish the government's right to regulate the conduct of\r\npurely private business to a degree never before known. Such a law to\r\nprotect the theory of individualism would be a most flagrant\r\ninfringement of the rights of individuals. It is plain, then, that\r\ngovernment cannot possibly keep up competition by direct action.\r\n\r\nWhether it is possible to do so by indirect means is a much harder\r\nquestion. Monopoly results, as we have found, from the intensity of\r\ncompetition. If it is possible to modify the intensity, to keep the\r\ncandle from burning itself out too quickly, so to speak, it is possible\r\nthat competition may be kept alive by legislative enactment. So far,\r\npractically nothing has been done in this direction, and it remains yet\r\nto be seen what remedies of this sort may accomplish.\r\n\r\nA pertinent example of an attempt by the government to keep competition\r\nalive is the Interstate Commerce law. Before its passage the railway\r\ncompanies had a patched-up and nominally illegal species of combination\r\nto restrict competition, known as pooling. As described by President\r\nCharles Francis Adams of the Union Pacific Railway, \"it was merely a\r\nmethod through which the weaker corporations were kept alive.\" The\r\nInterstate law prohibited this restriction of competition, and also, by\r\nenactment of the long-and short-haul clause, made the competition more\r\nwidespread and injurious to the railways. As a result an astonishing\r\nimpetus has been given to the growth of the great systems and the\r\nconsolidation of the minor competing roads. More than that, however, the\r\ngreat increase in the intensity of competition has done so much to drain\r\nthe resources of the companies and injure their revenues, that some\r\nmeasure for uniting all the railroads of the country under one\r\nmanagement is now being seriously planned by many men in railroad\r\ncircles. Thus this result, which was probably inevitable, has doubtless\r\nbeen hastened many years by the action of the law. The means taken to\r\nintensify competition has operated, as might have been expected, to\r\nhasten the complete establishment of monopoly.\r\n\r\nWe have now found that monopoly is the inevitable result of the\r\nconcentration of competition in any industry in a few hands, if events\r\nare allowed to take their natural course; that the only agent which has\r\neither the right or the power to interfere in the case is the\r\ngovernment,--National, State, or Municipal; that government cannot\r\npunish directly those who form combinations to restrict competition,\r\nwithout exercising to an unprecedented degree its right to interference\r\nwith private affairs; while its attempt to deter men from establishing\r\nmonopolies by refusing its protection to them in their contracts to\r\nrestrict competition has proved to be but a slight hindrance to the\r\ngrowth of monopoly.\r\n\r\nThere are, then, but two ways of preventing monopoly from establishing\r\nitself and laying such a tax upon the people at large for the supply of\r\nthe commodity which it controls as it chooses. The first is, action to\r\nreduce the intensity of competition so that the weaker competitors may\r\nmaintain their independence and not be forced to consolidate with their\r\nstronger rivals. The second is, action to permit or encourage the\r\nestablishment of monopoly, and regulate by some means other than\r\ncompetition the prices which it shall charge for the products and the\r\nquality of product which it shall supply. These two general classes of\r\nremedies which we find to be feasible we will discuss here only in a\r\ngeneral way. The first, reduction in the intensity of competition, has\r\nhardly been tried in any form, and we cannot yet say what practical\r\nmeans should be taken to put it into effect. We will return to this at a\r\nlater period in our discussion.\r\n\r\nThe second remedy is the one towards whose adoption we are rapidly\r\nworking. State and Interstate Commissions have already been established\r\nto regulate railway monopolies; and in general it is true that the\r\npeople who feel the burden of monopolies are looking to the government\r\nfor relief, and expect it to take positive action for the control of\r\nother monopolies as it has for the control of railways. It will be seen\r\nthat we have now arrived by a study of the various possible remedies for\r\nmonopoly at the same irresistible conclusion to which we were brought\r\nby our study of the laws of competition. _The proper remedy for monopoly\r\nis not abolition but control._ It seemed necessary to conduct this\r\nindependent investigation in order that no blind adherence to\r\nindividualism and no thought of the possible efficacy of other remedies\r\nmight lead us to doubt this important truth.\r\n\r\nWe have next to consider the fact that the government can control\r\nmonopolies in two ways. It can either permit the monopoly to remain\r\nunder private ownership, and regulate its operations by law and by duly\r\nappointed officers; or it can itself assume the entire ownership and\r\ncontrol of the monopoly. Which of these plans is the better, is a\r\nquestion of public policy over which future political parties are likely\r\nto dispute. One party will hold that when it is necessary for the\r\ngovernment to interfere to protect those whom it represents from the\r\noppression of monopoly, it should assume at once the whole ownership and\r\nmanagement of the monopoly. Their opponents will argue that government\r\nshould interfere only to the extent needful to maintain the rights of\r\nthe public; and that it is far better that industry should be directed\r\nby the private individuals whose interests are at stake than by\r\ngovernment officials. To discuss fully the arguments for each of these\r\ntwo principles of our future practice in dealing with monopolies, would\r\nbe beyond the intended scope of this volume. It can only be briefly said\r\nthat the arguments presented will certainly indicate that the conditions\r\nsurrounding each given monopoly will have great weight in determining\r\nwhich policy is the most advantageous. It would be manifestly unwise,\r\nfor instance, to place our postal facilities under the direction of a\r\ncorporation, even though its operations were regulated by government.\r\nIt would be even more unwise to place the operations of the flouring\r\nmills of the country in the hands of a department of the government. The\r\nimportant factors to be considered in deciding any given case are,\r\nfirst, the importance and necessity to the public of the service, and,\r\nsecond, the question whether production in the given case is likely to\r\nbe carried on more economically by the government or by private\r\nenterprise. The former has an advantage in that it can secure its\r\ncapital at a lower rate of interest. The latter, an advantage in that it\r\nsecures greater efficiency from the labor it employs. Other\r\ncircumstances being equal, it would appear wisest, then, for government\r\nto take direct charge of those monopolies in which the greatest amount\r\nof capital is invested and the least labor is employed, leaving to\r\nprivate enterprise under government regulation the operation of\r\nmonopolies in which the opposite set of conditions prevails.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, however, the question is complicated by the social\r\nand industrial effects which might follow a large transfer of enterprise\r\nfrom private to governmental direction; and these effects we will not\r\nnow discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nTHE SOVEREIGN RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE AND OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVE, THE\r\nGOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now at last deduced the important facts, that the only remedy\r\nfor the evils of monopoly must come from the popular will, expressed in\r\ndirect action by the government; that the government may possibly keep\r\ncompetition alive by checking its intensity, or can certainly allow\r\nevents to take their natural course and permit monopolies to be\r\nestablished. It can then protect the public, either by assuming itself\r\nthe ownership and operation of the monopoly, or by taking the less\r\nradical step of placing the monopoly under official supervision and\r\ncontrol while permitting its private ownership to continue. This\r\nconclusion is of the utmost importance, for it marks out one single\r\ndirection as the one in which relief from the evils which vex us may be\r\nfound. If we can once make the thinking people of the country understand\r\nthe effect which monopolies have upon their welfare, and that the evil\r\nwill not cure itself and cannot be cured by attempts to create\r\ncompetition or by any remedy short of direct action by the government,\r\nwe shall have made a great advance.\r\n\r\nBut with this goal reached, new questions at once present themselves.\r\nCan the interference of the government with private industries be\r\ndefended? How shall government exercise its control, so as to protect\r\nthe people without infringing vested property rights and discouraging\r\nprivate enterprise? It may be objected, too, that, while our preceding\r\ndiscussion has fully proved the weakness of other methods of dealing\r\nwith monopoly, compared with that by the direct action of government, it\r\nhas not been shown that the latter is practicable, or that it would not\r\nbe likely to result in more harm than good to the people at large.\r\n\r\nThese questions are coming before the people in a thousand practical\r\nforms. They are being fought over in courts and legislatures and\r\ncouncils, and are destined to be fought over at the polls. How important\r\ntheir right decision is, we have already seen. Let us make some attempt\r\nto find what this right decision is.\r\n\r\nIn taking up first the question of the rights of private property\r\nholders, we touch a point over which there is likely in the future to be\r\nserious dispute. A certain faction vigorously contend that past\r\nprecedents are no ground on which to base future action, and that little\r\nattention need be paid to the rights of private owners if the public\r\ninterest is at stake. A far stronger and more influential faction are\r\njealous of every thing which seems to question their right to hold and\r\nuse their property in whatever way they see fit. But certainly, if their\r\nclaims are just, they need not fear the result of that investigation\r\nwhich every idea we have inherited from former generations has in these\r\ndays to receive. It would be beyond the scope of our investigation to\r\nmake any exhaustive study of this subject, but it is necessary to note\r\nsome of the important facts in connection with property rights as light\r\nupon the question at issue.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be conceded that the question is to be\r\ndecided upon its merits, and not by precedent. It is of little use for\r\none faction to show, as they can, that the idea of private property is\r\nlargely of modern growth; or for their opponents to prove, as they may,\r\nthat the progress of law and government has been continually toward\r\nbetter protection of the rights of property. The question must be, on\r\nwhat grounds of inherent right or public expediency is property held\r\nto-day in private ownership? Distasteful as it may be, to realize that\r\nwhat has been considered a fundamental principle of civilized society is\r\nhere challenged and put upon the defensive, the fact remains that the\r\ndefence must be made, and must be based only on what is just and wise\r\nto-day, for the opposing side may properly reject arguments based on the\r\nwholly different conditions under which past generations lived.\r\n\r\nThe question of the rights of property in the products of labor we may\r\npass briefly, as it is almost undisputed; and while certain thinkers\r\nhave asserted that there is no such thing as a natural right to the\r\nownership of property of any sort, it seems certain that this is true\r\nonly in a technical sense; and that a man's right to hold, control,\r\ndispose of, and enjoy the fruits of his own strength or skill is as\r\ncertain as his right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\"\r\nand follows from that right as a natural sequence. The most radical\r\nrevolutionist hardly ventures nowadays to argue against this fact. Thus,\r\nthough it is recognized that private property even in one's own strength\r\nand skill must, at times, be subjected to the higher law of public\r\nnecessity--as when in time of war a man may be obliged to give up his\r\ntime, strength, and even life for the public welfare--in general the\r\nright to hold the results of labor as private property is well\r\nestablished, on the grounds both of natural right and public expediency.\r\n\r\nBut when we consider the private ownership of the gifts of Nature and of\r\npublic franchises, it is apparent that we are on very different ground.\r\nThese forms of property, which constitute a great proportion of the\r\nworld's total wealth, are not created by labor. Nature's gifts were not\r\nstored up to enrich and benefit any one man, but the whole race. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that they are always, in the first instance, public\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe argument presented to prove any inherent right of the private owners\r\nto any form of natural wealth seem to be insufficient to prove the case.\r\nThe fact seems to be that the inherent right to the benefit of every one\r\nof Nature's gifts is vested, if perfect equity were established, in the\r\nwhole human race; or, as a reasonable approach to this, in that portion\r\nof the public to whom this gift is a direct benefit. The title which the\r\npublic holds may be transferred to private individuals, as a matter of\r\nexpediency; but the public must still retain a prior claim upon the\r\nproperty. Its right to have the property used for the general welfare,\r\ntranscends the right of any private owner to direct it solely to his own\r\nprofit and the public injury.\r\n\r\nIt is thus plain that the private ownership of our natural wealth and of\r\nall public franchises rests on the grounds of expediency alone. All the\r\nlands and mineral wealth, all franchises for railway lines and for the\r\nvarious public works discussed in the chapters on municipal monopolies\r\nwere the heritage of the whole people in the first instance, and they\r\nhave only transferred the title to private owners because it seemed\r\nexpedient so to do. On the grounds of expediency alone, then, is the\r\nprivate ownership of natural wealth to be considered.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that in the case of our own country, the\r\ntransfer to private owners of the title to our natural resources has\r\nbeen in the past the wisest and only proper course. It is a fact not\r\noften realized that the title to nearly all the natural wealth of the\r\ncountry, almost all the lands and mines and forests, has been held\r\ndirectly by the public within a century, and that the transfer to\r\nprivate owners of a great part of it has taken place within a\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThe question now comes: Did the public, in transferring the title to a\r\nprivate owner, relinquish all its right to the future control of these\r\nvaluable properties, as a private owner would have done? The answer must\r\nbe in the negative. Regarded simply as a matter of expediency, it is\r\nplain that to cause the act of any public official to bind all\r\nsucceeding generations, living under dissimilar conditions and\r\ncircumstances, which were then unknown and unprophesied, might result in\r\nunbearable evils. Necessary as it might be at the start to give away\r\nvaluable properties to meet present needs, one generation or its\r\nrepresentatives has no conceivable right to sell for a mess of pottage\r\nthe heritage of all succeeding ones. The fact is, then, that the natural\r\ntitle to all gifts of Nature is vested in the public at large; and while\r\nit is in duty bound to observe the contracts which it makes with private\r\nparties, it is also not to be thought that the dishonesty or\r\nincompetence of a public official, or the failure to foresee the future,\r\ncan work for too long a time an injury to the community.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that, in every case where the public has transferred to\r\nprivate owners the title to any gift of Nature, or has conferred any\r\nfranchise upon a corporation, under whatever conditions, the right of\r\nsupreme control still remains with the natural owner, the public; and\r\nwhen the need arises, this control may be exercised. The rights of the\r\nowners and the contract obligations into which the public has entered\r\nshould be regarded so far as possible; but when the public necessity\r\ndemands, control on its behalf can always be exercised.\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a formidable and revolutionary doctrine, but, in\r\nreality, it is based on every-day acts of the public representatives,\r\nwith which every one is familiar. Suppose it is conceived to be for the\r\npublic interest that a certain railway shall be built. To do this it is\r\nnecessary to cross many hundred tracts of land, the title to which was\r\nmany years ago transferred by the public to private owners who have\r\nbought and sold since then as they pleased, as if their control were\r\nabsolute. Many of the owners of these lands may be opposed to parting\r\nwith the right of way necessary for a railroad, but their private wishes\r\nmust not stop the progress of improvements necessary to the general\r\nwelfare. The State, which has the natural title, asserts its right to\r\nsupreme control; and, if necessary, will use all its power to force\r\nthese private owners to relinquish their land for the public good. This\r\nis the commonest example of the exercise of the right of eminent domain,\r\nbut other cases frequently occur. The laying out of city streets,\r\nbuilding public bridges, and, in fact, highways of every class, furnish\r\na similar example. Provision of public water supply often requires an\r\nexercise of this power even more positive than in the cases just cited.\r\nBy the construction of one great reservoir to store the flow of the\r\nCroton water-shed for the supply of New York City, it is proposed to\r\ncondemn the dwellings and lands now owned and occupied by several\r\nthousand people. It is to be noted that, in every case, the rights of\r\nthe private owners are observed, and compensation is made them for the\r\ndamage done.\r\n\r\nUnder the common law the owner of lands bordering a running stream has\r\ncertain rights to its use; and these riparian rights, as they are\r\ncalled, have been established by precedent for centuries. But, in the\r\nState of Colorado, it was found that the water in the streams was of\r\nsuch value for irrigation that the old system of permitting private\r\nownership of these riparian rights led to grave abuses. The State\r\nConstitution, therefore, declares that all water in running streams is\r\nthe inalienable property of the whole people, and the system providing\r\nfor its use by private parties is based on this principle.\r\n\r\nSo much for the power of the public to exercise its supreme control,\r\nwhen public exigency requires, over Nature's gifts in land and water. As\r\nan example of the supreme control of the public over the franchises\r\nwhich it grants, take the case of the railway again. It is well\r\nestablished that the public has the right through its legal\r\nrepresentatives to regulate the management and operation of the railway\r\nin every detail; and not only that, but the rates which the railway may\r\ncharge for its services as well. Many other examples might be given, for\r\nthe necessities of the present decade have awakened men as never before\r\nto the facts which we have just discussed. The final conclusion must\r\ninevitably be that _the public as the sole possible holder of the\r\nnatural title to the gifts of Nature, while it may find it expedient to\r\ntransfer this ownership to private owners, retains always supreme\r\ncontrol, which may be exercised as the public exigency demands_.\r\n\r\nWe have next to determine in what cases the exercise by the public of\r\nthis right of supreme control over its heritage is demanded. We are\r\ngreatly aided here, however, by the thorough study we have made of the\r\nlaws of competition. It is evident at once that competition in the case\r\nof natural agents acts according to the laws already found. Agricultural\r\nland in this country is so abundant and its ownership is so widely\r\ndiffused that any monopoly of it is now impossible. Each farmer competes\r\nwith every other farmer, and the extension of transportation facilities\r\nhas so broadened the field of competition that in no industry is the day\r\nwhen the few competing units shall replace the many, and monopoly shall\r\nensue, farther off than in this. In Great Britain and Ireland opposite\r\nconditions prevail. A limited amount of land is held by a few owners,\r\nand its rental is fixed without competition; consequently the land\r\nquestion has been almost, if not quite, the chief issue in British\r\npolitics during this decade.\r\n\r\nIf we examine Nature's gifts to the world in the shape of metals, we\r\nfind iron to be so widely distributed that competition has always acted\r\nto reduce profits, and that combinations to restrict competition in the\r\nproduction of the metal have only recently become even possible. On the\r\nother hand, the workable deposits of copper are so scarce and the number\r\nof competitors in its production is so much smaller, that it has become\r\nthe subject of the greatest monopoly the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nWith these examples--and any number of others might be cited--is it not\r\nplain enough that the laws of competition are exactly applicable to aid\r\nin solving the problem? The smaller the number of competing units, the\r\nstronger the tendency to monopoly. Certain gifts of Nature are given to\r\nus in profusion. The people transfer the title to private owners, and\r\nof these there must of necessity be so many that they will compete\r\nsteadily with each other. The consequence is that the people receive the\r\nbenefit from the country's natural resources, while the private owner\r\ngets only enough to compensate him reasonably well for the labor he\r\nemploys and the capital which he invests. Certain other gifts of Nature\r\nare, as we have found, very scarce; the number of men who can own and\r\nuse them and compete with each other in offering their advantages to the\r\npublic is necessarily small. The inevitable result of this condition is,\r\nfirst, intense competition and then monopoly.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that there is no necessity for the State to interfere\r\nwith the private ownership of those gifts of Nature which are so widely\r\ndistributed that competition can act for the protection of the public.\r\nAs regards those other gifts which are so limited in their extent that\r\ntheir control has become a matter of monopoly, the right of the public\r\nto exercise its control is already proven. Whether in any given case the\r\nexigency is so great as to call for the assertion of this power, is a\r\nquestion which must be decided in each case separately.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, with truth, that nothing short of the actual\r\nownership of all Nature's gifts by the public is in accord with\r\nabsolutely perfect justice; but as a matter of fact every human work\r\ncarried out by human hands and brains is only an approach to perfection.\r\nIt will never be possible by any human agency to distribute the wealth\r\nproduction of the world with absolute equity. A careful writer says:\r\n\"The view that the right of every human being to his share in the gifts\r\nof Nature should be recognized is not an unreasonable one.\" But by no\r\nsystem possible of putting into practical execution can these gifts be\r\nequitably divided among all men. What can be done is to cause the\r\nbenefit of these gifts to be widely distributed, and to prevent them\r\nfrom being monopolized for the benefit of a few.\r\n\r\nThe fact maybe alluded to, that even under widespread competition the\r\nholders of the most favorably situated and richest lands, mines, etc.,\r\nreceive a benefit which in absolute equity should be divided among all\r\nmen. But the vastly more important matter of the monopolies which\r\nprevent the public from obtaining the benefit of the natural resources\r\nto which it holds an inalienable title, so overshadows such trivial\r\ninjustices that they may be neglected. So much attention has been called\r\nof late, however, to the fact that land as a gift of Nature should, if\r\nabsolute justice were done, have the benefit from its use equally\r\ndivided among all men, that something further on this subject may be\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nLet us first note the fact, which no one will dispute, that the title\r\nheld by the public refers only to the \"site value.\" The value of all\r\nimprovements which are the product of labor belongs to the owner by\r\nnatural right. Now it is conceivable that of the total value of\r\n$10,197,000,000 at which the farms of the United States were valued at\r\nthe last census, $7,000,000,000 may perhaps have been the value of the\r\nland apart from the value of the buildings and improvements made since\r\nthe country was settled. In 1880 there were at least 3,500,000 farmers\r\nwho owned agricultural lands. It is a well-known fact that the holding\r\nof agricultural land in large parcels is the rare exception. We may\r\nreasonably conclude, therefore, that the \"site value\" held by each\r\nfarmer was about $2,000. This is the sum which in absolute equity is\r\nsaid to belong to the public at large. But let us reflect that each\r\nfarmer has only received a small proportion of this $2,000 through the\r\nincrease in the value of his land. The fact is that the land which at\r\nfirst was actually valueless has increased in value with each\r\ngeneration, and it is this increase alone, apart from the increase due\r\nto the betterments, after which the public has any right to inquire.\r\nRemembering the number of sales and changes in the ownership which take\r\nplace in this country, how often the benefits which have accrued to a\r\nsingle property are divided up among a number of heirs, and that each\r\nowner represents on the average a family of three individuals, it seems\r\nreasonable to suppose that this increase in the \"site value\" of each\r\nfarm may have been divided among twenty different persons. Thus, while\r\nthe statement may be made that the public has a claim upon the farms of\r\nthe country of $7,000,000,000, it must be remembered that this sum has\r\nbeen divided among about 70,000,000 different people, and that this\r\ndivision has been in progress for over two centuries. When the benefits\r\nof our natural resources are so widely distributed as this, there can be\r\nlittle occasion to alarm ourselves regarding injustice through the\r\nprivate control of farming lands.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is somewhat apart from our argument. The main point, of\r\nwhich we must not lose sight, is that the private ownership of those\r\ngifts of Nature which are widely distributed operates to the general\r\nbenefit of the community far more than any system of public ownership\r\nthat could be devised. But, on the other hand, in the case of natural\r\nagents limited in amount, it is practically certain that sooner or later\r\na monopoly will be established by their private owners, to the serious\r\ndetriment of the public at large. The sovereign right of the public in\r\nthis latter case to take such steps as are necessary for its proper\r\nprotection, is something which both _a priori_ reasoning and judicial\r\ndecisions amply prove.\r\n\r\nThe great problem of monopoly would be a far easier one to solve, both\r\ntheoretically and practically, were it as easy to regulate justly those\r\nforms of monopoly whose strength lies in combination only, as it is\r\nthose whose power depends on the possession of gifts of Nature, which we\r\nhave just considered. In dealing with trusts, monopolies in trade, and\r\nlabor monopolies, we are in danger, on the one hand, of sanctioning\r\noppressive interference with private business, and on the other of\r\npermitting a license in the conduct of private business which encourages\r\nits managers to continue to extort unjust gains from the public. In the\r\nface of this difficulty, which careful consideration shows to be very\r\nserious, and in the dread of other evils, such as the government proving\r\nincompetent to safely undertake these new and strange responsibilities,\r\nwe may well feel like trying to get along with the aid of those old\r\ndefenses against monopolies that have always, until the modern\r\nconcentration of industry was accomplished, been ample to hold them in\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nBut the one argument which prevents this is the fact that this tendency\r\nto concentration and consolidation is still actively at work. In the\r\nwords of Prof. Ely: \"Production on the largest possible scale will be\r\nthe only practical mode of production in the near future.\" It is for\r\nthis reason that we must not cease to look about for some better\r\nprotection against this new class of monopolies than are afforded by\r\nmerely placing stumbling-blocks in their way. We shall have need, for\r\nmany years yet, of such weapons in fighting monopoly as the public is\r\nalready familiar with; the creation of new competitors and their support\r\nby public opinion, judicial decisions against combinations, and the\r\nlike. But before these grow absolutely useless, we ought to be prepared\r\nto meet the new conditions of industry with something better than mere\r\nopposition; and even now be experimenting and studying upon a permanent\r\nand consistent policy.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to control monopolies which are not dependent on natural\r\nagents for their strength, we are met at once by the declaration that\r\nthe government has no power or right to interfere with property which is\r\nthe product of labor; and that the owner cannot be prevented from making\r\nsuch disposition of it as he chooses. The President and Counsel of the\r\nSugar Trust said after Judge Barrett's decision was announced: \"We do\r\nnot believe that the law prevents two persons engaged in rivalry with\r\neach other from uniting their interests.\" This seems indeed true; and\r\nyet, on reflection, it appears to be absolutely certain that power must\r\nreside in the sovereign people to protect themselves from the unjust\r\ntaxation which a monopoly may seek to enforce. Let us brush away cobwebs\r\nand set the facts clearly before us. That competition among producers is\r\nthe sole present protection of the public against extortionate prices is\r\nundoubted. When by combination this defense is abolished, has not the\r\npublic a right to adopt some other means of protection? There can be no\r\ndoubt that it has; the only question is, what form should that\r\nprotection take?\r\n\r\nIt must be plain that, as a general rule, it is unfitting that\r\ngovernment should own and operate industrial establishments. Practical\r\nexperience has indicated that this experiment is wellnigh certain to\r\nresult in failure, for reasons so evident as to require no mention here.\r\nThe only alternative remaining is government regulation with private\r\nownership and management. The essential features in the adoption of any\r\nplan should be that the returns of the private owner should be in\r\nproportion to the skill and economy which he exercises in managing his\r\nbusiness; that competition and its resulting waste be done away with;\r\nand that the industry be placed on such a safe and stable basis that the\r\ncapital invested in it shall receive the lowest possible rate of\r\ninterest, thus leaving the greatest possible amount for the payment of\r\nwages of labor and permitting sales of the product at a low price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL PLANS FOR THE CONTROL OF MONOPOLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the preceding chapters, leading up to the final\r\nconclusion that the proper and only wise remedy for the evils of\r\nmonopoly lies in direct action of the government to protect the rights\r\nof the people, finishes the chain of our argument and really\r\naccomplishes the work laid out in the opening chapter. The laws which we\r\nhave found to govern competition in modern industry are so far-reaching\r\nin their effects, and their correct apprehension by the people at large\r\nis so important to the general welfare, that economists ought to unite\r\nin recognizing and teaching their truth, while all who desire to work\r\nfor the alleviation of present crying evils of society should understand\r\nthese laws and be guided by them.\r\n\r\nIn the practical application of these truths, however, so many\r\ncomplicated details are involved that there is ample reason for the\r\nwidest differences of opinion. To decide intelligently upon these\r\npractical methods demands special knowledge, in order that all necessary\r\ndetails may be provided for, and rare practical judgment to adapt the\r\nmethod to the means at hand.\r\n\r\nThe investigations which the author has pursued in the preparation of\r\nthe preceding chapters and for certain other purposes have suggested to\r\nhim certain principles in the practical execution of plans for the\r\ncontrol of various monopolies, which seem to him necessary to success in\r\nthe work. Well understanding the fallibility of any one man's judgment,\r\nespecially in these matters of detail, he has determined to outline in a\r\nbrief way what seem to him the most feasible plans for the control of\r\neach class of monopolies. These suggestions, however, are to be regarded\r\nin an entirely different light from the general laws propounded in the\r\npreceding chapters; and they are presented with a full knowledge of the\r\nfact that slight variations in circumstances may necessitate wide\r\nchanges in plans and processes.\r\n\r\nTaking up the monopolies which by their use of natural agents or their\r\nexercise of a franchise granted by the public, are already acknowledged\r\nto be subject to the public control, let us consider first the railway\r\nsystem. The two years in which the Interstate Commerce law has been in\r\nforce have seen a great progress toward the final solution of this\r\nproblem, even though railway affairs are at present in so unsatisfactory\r\na condition. The important features of our future policy which now seem\r\nto be quite generally understood are: full State and national control\r\nover both tariff rates and facilities; the abolition of competition,\r\neither by consolidation or by legalized agreements to that end; and\r\nstrict prohibition of the construction of parallel lines not warranted\r\nby the traffic.\r\n\r\nThat we are working very rapidly in this direction, no one will deny who\r\nis familiar with the progress of legislation affecting railway interests\r\nand with the opinions of railway men. Evidently, however, government\r\ncannot justly take so prominent a part in railway management without\r\nbecoming in some degree responsible to railway stock- and bond-holders\r\nfor the protection of their interests; and it is a difficult question to\r\nsay in what manner this responsibility should be met. It has been the\r\nintention of the author in devising the following plan for the control\r\nof our railway system to make this responsibility a definite one, and\r\nnot leave it as now, a vague constitutional right. For according to the\r\nlaw at present, State and national legislators may make laws to vary the\r\nreceipts and expenditures of the railway companies as much as they\r\nplease, and the only redress of the railway owner is an appeal to the\r\ncourts, the judges of which must decide whether the company's revenue is\r\nso injured that its legal rights are infringed.\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit here a full statement of the many serious evils\r\nand abuses with which our present system of railway management is\r\nburdened. The study which the author has made of them has convinced him\r\nof their importance and magnitude. The following plan is designed to\r\npermit their remedy as well as to remedy the special evils of monopoly\r\nwith which our present investigation is concerned:\r\n\r\nLet the government acquire the title to the franchise, permanent way,\r\nand real estate of all the railway lines in the country. Let a few\r\ncorporations be organized under government auspices; and let each, by\r\nthe terms of its charter, receive a perpetual lease of all the railway\r\nlines built or to be built within a given territory. Let the territory\r\nof each of these corporations be so large and so planned with regard to\r\nits neighbors that there shall be, so far as possible, no competition\r\nbetween them. For instance, one corporation would operate all lines\r\nsouth of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi rivers; another all lines\r\neast of the Hudson and of Lake Champlain, etc. Let the terms of rental\r\nof these lines be about 3¼ per cent. on the road's actual \"present\r\ncost\" (the sum of money it would cost to rebuild it entirely at present\r\nprices of material and labor) less a due allowance for depreciation. The\r\ncorporations would be obliged to keep the property in as good condition\r\nas when received, and would own absolutely all their rolling stock,\r\nmachinery, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed, however, that the government shall own any interest\r\nin the railways save the legal title. Bonds would be issued to the full\r\namount of the appraised valuation, running twenty-five years and bearing\r\ninterest at 3 per cent., principal and interest guaranteed by the\r\ngovernment, and these would be sold to the highest bidder. Thus the real\r\nownership of the roads would be vested in the bondholders. As is well\r\nknown, there is a great and fast increasing need for investments of\r\nabsolute safety, even though they bear very low rates of interest. This\r\nis especially desirable for the continuance of our national banking\r\nsystem, in order to insure us a safe, stable, and ample currency. Such\r\nbonds would find a market at a premium as fast as offered.\r\n\r\nIt would not even be necessary that the money to pay the interest\r\ncoupons should pass through the government's hands. The operating\r\ncompany would pay it directly to the bond-holder and at the same time\r\nthe ¼ of 1 per cent. would be paid into the government treasury.\r\n\r\nThe object in making the bonds run for no longer time than twenty-five\r\nyears, when it is intended that the whole value of the road shall be\r\nperpetually held in the form of bonds, is that at proper intervals a\r\nrevaluation may be made of the improvements to the road and the\r\ninterest charges may be readjusted to correspond with the general\r\nchange in the income from capital. When the bonds fall due, a new block\r\nwould be issued and sold to the highest bidder. The interest rate should\r\nbe set at such a point that the bonds could be sold at a premium. These\r\npremiums, with the ¼ of 1 per cent. on the bonds, paid by the operating\r\ncompany to the government, (which we may regard as a legitimate fee to\r\nthe government for its guaranty) should form a government railway fund.\r\nThis should be used, first, to defray the expenses of the government\r\ndepartment of railways, and second, to pay the deficit when on any line\r\nthe net receipts after operating expenses are paid are insufficient to\r\npay the rental. The remainder should be expended in making improvements\r\nand additions to the railway system, such as building new bridges and\r\nstations, and improving the line, the cost of which, however, should be\r\nrepresented by additional bonds at the end of the twenty-five-year term.\r\nThe amount of income should be so regulated, by varying the rate of\r\ninterest on new bonds, that the sum remaining for the last purpose may\r\nbe about sufficient for usual needs. The whole administration of the\r\nreceipt and expenditure of this fund should be vested in the government\r\ndepartment of railways. In this way the danger that the whole work of\r\nthis government department might be blocked through the neglect of\r\nCongress to make necessary appropriations, would be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe readjustment of existing stocks and bonds presents difficulties\r\nwhich will be considered in very different ways by different classes of\r\npersons. The \"granger\" element, for instance, would cut off the holder\r\nof \"watered stock\" with a shilling. Fortunately, if we take time enough,\r\nwe can arrange this matter with no shadow of injustice. To illustrate:\r\nThe government can purchase the A. B. & C. road outright at its market\r\nvalue, which, owing to inflated prices and watered securities, is\r\nperhaps $3,000,000. It is desired to wipe out $1,000,000 of this to\r\nplace the road upon its proper basis. The government issues 3 per cent.\r\nguaranteed ten-year bonds upon the road and leases it at an annual\r\nrental of 6 per cent. on what it has paid. At the time the bonds are\r\ndue, the accumulation of rentals over interest is more than sufficient\r\nto pay off $1,000,000 of the bonds, while the remainder are renewed on\r\nthe permanent basis.\r\n\r\nThe author is well aware that a very strong prejudice exists against the\r\nlending by the government of its credit to private corporations. This\r\nprejudice--which has perhaps already been sufficient to condemn the\r\nplan, as thus far presented, in the mind of the reader--he believes to\r\nbe a very wise and well founded one. The assumption by the government of\r\nany risk in connection with corporate enterprise is highly undesirable.\r\nIt is now to be noted that this objection is wholly overcome; for,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the government guarantees the bonds of the\r\nrailways, it is not proposed that it shall really assume any risk, as\r\nwill be seen from the further description of the powers and obligations\r\nof the operating corporations.\r\n\r\nThese should be essentially private companies, but there should be two\r\nor three representatives of the government on the Board of Directors.\r\nThey should be required to operate the roads in a safe, efficient, and\r\neconomical manner, and to keep accurate and simple records, open to the\r\ninspection of the Government Commissioners, of the receipts and\r\nexpenditures on every separate line of road. The rates of fare and\r\nfreight should be, first of all, stable. When once fixed they should\r\nneither be raised nor lowered except by the direction of the Government\r\nRailway Commissioners. Next--and this is the cardinal feature of the\r\nwhole plan--it should be the endeavor to fix the rates of fare and\r\nfreight at such a point that the total receipts would be sufficient,\r\nfirst, to pay the whole expense of operating and maintaining the road;\r\nsecond, to pay the annual rental of 3¼ per cent. interest on the cost of\r\nthe road; and, third, an annual dividend to the stockholders of the\r\noperating company of from 4 to 8 per cent. The capital stock of the\r\noperating company should be fixed by law at about 1¼ times the actual\r\ncost of rolling stock and machinery. The operating company should be\r\nallowed to issue only one class of securities, and these should\r\nrepresent at par the actual cash capital invested by the operating\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nUnder this plan it is evident that every community would pay its\r\nequitable share of the cost of transportation, since the rates would be\r\nbased on the cost of service.[6] Instead of roads running along,\r\nbankrupt for years, as now, we would have every community paying for\r\nits transportation facilities just what it cost to furnish them. But if,\r\non any road, such a rule would raise the rates above a certain\r\nprescribed maximum point, then the rate could be lowered, if necessary,\r\nto a point where it was only great enough to pay the operating expenses;\r\nand part or all the bond interest would be paid out of the government\r\nrailway fund.\r\n\r\n    [6] It should be explained that it is only proposed to base the\r\n    _rates as a whole_ upon the cost of service. As regards the relative\r\n    rates on different commodities, the author, in common with all who\r\n    have given careful study to the question, recognizes that the only\r\n    equitable principle for proportioning rates is the much maligned one\r\n    of \"charging [in proportion to] what the traffic will bear.\" The\r\n    argument against this principle is so very plausible that, until he\r\n    had given the subject thorough study he held a diametrically\r\n    opposite opinion.\r\n\r\n    To make plain to the reader that this is really the only equitable\r\n    principle, the following illustration may serve: A coal-mine\r\n    operator and a sewing-machine manufacturer build together a railroad\r\n    to carry their respective products to a market. They will fix the\r\n    total rates of freight at such a point as to just pay the cost of\r\n    service; but it is required to find what relative rates each should\r\n    be equitably charged on the shipments from his works. Evidently, to\r\n    have the rates perfectly equitable, they must be in exact proportion\r\n    to the _benefit_ which each party derives from the use of the road.\r\n    But this benefit which each derives is _measured_ by the profits\r\n    which each makes from his business; and this profit, in turn, is the\r\n    measure of the amount each can afford to pay for the use of the\r\n    road,--that is to say, \"what the traffic will bear.\" _Q. E. D._\r\n\r\n\"But,\" the objector says, \"is it not true that when you limit the\r\nprofits of the companies and base rates on cost of service you take away\r\nall incentive to economy and careful operation? The public, and not the\r\ncompany, gain if the cost of service is reduced; so why should the\r\nmanager exert himself to economize? This very same principle has been\r\ntried. Many States have chartered railway corporations, and provided\r\nthat fares and freight rates should be reduced when dividends exceeded a\r\ncertain per cent., or else that a percentage of the surplus earnings,\r\nabove the amount necessary to earn, say 10 per cent. dividends, should\r\nbe paid into the State treasury. Of course the railway corporations who\r\nhave been able to earn surplus dividends which they were not permitted\r\nto pay, have been sharp enough to spend their surplus on their own\r\nproperty instead of turning it over to the State treasury. How is it\r\npossible, then, to base rates on cost of service and still leave the\r\nincentive to economy, frugality, and efficiency which exists, when the\r\ncorporation is permitted to make all the profits it can?\"\r\n\r\nTo discover a means of overcoming this difficulty, let us see how it is\r\novercome under competition. A man invents a new machine, for instance,\r\nwhich effects a saving in the cost of some manufacturing process of 50\r\nper cent. One manufacturer adopts it because it greatly increases his\r\nprofits, and one by one his competitors follow suit. The competition\r\nbetween them cuts the prices lower and lower, till finally the consumers\r\nof the goods get all the benefit from the saving effected by the new\r\nmachine, and the manufacturers' profits are no greater than they were\r\noriginally. But the important point to be noted is this, that the\r\nbenefit to the manufacturer continued long enough to repay him for\r\nintroducing the machine. So in our attempts to base railway rates upon\r\ncost of service, we must permit the profit from the introduction of\r\neconomies, the use of improved appliances, etc., to be gathered by the\r\nrailway company long enough to induce it to work toward that end.\r\n\r\nAll we need to do to effect this end is to _somewhat delay_ the change\r\nin rates to correspond to change in cost of service. As already stated,\r\nit is most necessary that rates should be _stable_, and it is proposed\r\nto make any change, either advance or reduction, only through the action\r\nof a Government Commission. Now, suppose that some such clause as this\r\nforms a part of our railway law: \"upon the petition of any railway\r\ncorporation, or of not less than twenty-five patrons of any single\r\n'railway district,' it shall be the duty of the Railway Commission to\r\ninvestigate regarding a readjustment of rates to correspond more closely\r\nto the cost of service. If it shall be found that in the given 'railway\r\ndistrict' the net receipts over the operating expenses and fixed\r\ncharges have been for one year not less than 9 per cent. on the capital\r\nof the operating company invested in the given railway district; and\r\nthat for two successive years they have been not less than 8 per cent.;\r\nor, if they have been for one year 8 per cent., and for two years 7 per\r\ncent., and it shall be proven to the satisfaction of the Commission,\r\nthat any due and proper measure of economy, to which the attention of\r\nthe officers was called in writing has been wilfully neglected, or that\r\nany uncalled for and manifestly extravagant expenditures have been\r\nentered into during that time, then it shall be the duty of the\r\nCommission to lower the rates. If it shall be found that for one year\r\nthe net earnings have been less than 3½ per cent., and for two years\r\nless than 4½ per cent., unless it shall be proven that this deficit has\r\nbeen fostered by neglect of due economy, or by extravagant expenditure\r\nas aforesaid, the rates shall be raised. In all cases where rates are\r\nreadjusted, it shall be the endeavor of the Commission to set them at\r\nsuch a point that the net earnings will equal 6 per cent. on the capital\r\nstock.\"\r\n\r\nThe provision requiring two years of excess or deficiency before a\r\nchange, would be necessary to avoid the fluctuations which occur in\r\nsingle seasons. Every piece of economy is so much gain to the\r\nstockholders, and its benefit is received for at least two years. It\r\nmust be remembered that in any railway corporation, as at present\r\nconducted, none but the highest of the managing officials have any\r\npersonal interest in the profit from operations. It may well be\r\nbelieved, therefore, that the measure of economy and efficiency effected\r\nwould be at least as great as now. As this plan also contemplates\r\ngovernment representation on the Board of Directors, any action by the\r\nhigher officials to evade the law would be unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of a company operating say 30,000 miles of railway and\r\ncarrying its traffic at fixed rates would vary but little from year to\r\nyear; and its stock would be so largely held by investors and would vary\r\nso little in price that there would be very little speculation in it. To\r\nbankrupt the company would be an impossibility, since its receipts would\r\nalways be regulated to preserve its revenue, although not so strictly\r\nbut that the company would still have every incentive to cultivate\r\ntraffic by offering good facilities, and to economize at the same time\r\nby the introduction of improved methods.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it can be shown where every detail of the foregoing plan leaves\r\nloop-holes for abuses to creep in. It will be much the same with any\r\nplan whatever. The questions to be asked are, would abuses, waste and\r\nstealing be any more likely to occur than under any other plan? Could\r\nthey be any more prevalent than they are now,--bearable only because we\r\nare calloused to them? Of course, the foregoing is a mere outline of the\r\ngeneral principles of the plan. Details which readily suggest themselves\r\nwould, of course, be necessary to carry out the principle successfully.\r\n\r\nThat some attempt should be made in this connection to solve the\r\nperplexing problem of strikes on railway lines is proven by the\r\nmemorable engineers' strike on the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy system.\r\nPerhaps a provision requiring every employé and officer to hold at least\r\na certain number of shares in the operating company in proportion to his\r\nsalary would help to solve the labor problem; and it might give the\r\nhigher officers a greater interest in their work than they always show.\r\n\r\nThe author has deemed it worth while to outline the foregoing plan for\r\nthe equitable control of railway monopolies with considerable fulness,\r\nbecause, to a very great extent, the principles followed in the design\r\nof this plan are applicable to a great number of other monopolies. These\r\nimportant principles are: (1) Government protection to the owners of\r\nfixed capital so that the public may obtain the use of it at the lowest\r\npossible rate of interest. (2) The operation of monopolies by\r\ncorporations rather than by the government, thus securing the increased\r\nefficiency of private over official management. (3) Securing to the\r\npeople at large the benefit of the monopoly by basing the prices for its\r\nproduct on cost of service. (4) But leaving a suitable incentive for the\r\ncompany's managers to maintain economy and efficiency in its operations.\r\n(5) Government representation in the directorate controlling the\r\nordinary affairs of the company.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the plan just outlined for railways would be\r\nespecially well adapted, with but slight changes, for the control of the\r\ntelegraph lines of the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe will next consider the monopolies discussed in Chapter III. It seems\r\ntoo plain to need proof that our mines and quarries are certain to have\r\na steady increase in value as we use up the easily worked surface\r\ndeposits and have to dig deeper shafts and develop the poorer deposits\r\nto supply the demand. In the case of any metals or minerals of which the\r\ndeposits are so abundant, easily worked, and widely scattered, that the\r\nnumber of evenly matched competitors is great enough to ensure steady\r\ncompetition, the public will get the benefit of the especial gift of\r\nNature, and its owner can receive little more than an ordinary return\r\nfor his labor and capital. But, as we have already amply shown, in the\r\nproduction of a great number of minerals and metals competition has been\r\nkilled, or is heavily handicapped by the vast advantages of a few\r\nbonanza mines, and the public is being taxed millions of dollars for\r\nthat which belongs to it by right.\r\n\r\nHow long is this condition to continue? Must all succeeding generations\r\npay for coal, copper, zinc, lead, nickel, marble, oil, gas, and various\r\nother products of our mother-earth just what those who control the chief\r\ndeposits choose to ask? Because a pioneer stumbles upon a valuable mine,\r\nshall the sole right to use the product of that mine be secured \"to him,\r\nhis heirs and assigns\" forever?\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, that each of the several States were to acquire the title\r\nto all the productive mines, quarries, and mineral wealth within its\r\nborders, and enact laws providing that future discoverers of minerals on\r\nland where they are not now known to exist should be liberally rewarded,\r\nif the discovery proved valuable, but the minerals should belong to the\r\nState and not to the owner of the land. The same principle which we\r\nfound to apply in the case of the railways would serve here in\r\nreadjusting values, viz.: the difference in the rates of interest on\r\nsafe investments and on risky ones. When acquired, the mines should be\r\nleased to private parties for operation. In the case of coal-mines and\r\nperhaps of iron, it would be well to copy largely from the scheme\r\nproposed for railway operation, viz.: place all the business in the\r\nhands of a single company, which should thus be enabled to carry on its\r\nbusiness on the largest possible scale; do away with wasteful\r\ncompetition, and aim to regulate prices to provide a certain reasonable\r\nsteady income on its capital to the mining company.\r\n\r\nFor mines of copper, zinc, lead, and similar metals, it would be best to\r\npursue a different plan, and simply provide by statute that such mines\r\nshould be leased for short terms of years to the bidder who would offer\r\nto sell his product at the lowest price per ton at the mines, all\r\nlettings and relettings to be publicly advertised, and the successful\r\nbidder to give bonds for the faithful performance of his contract. It is\r\ndifficult to see how, under these conditions, a combination to defeat\r\ncompetition could be formed. Relettings of expired leases would be\r\nfrequent; and bidding by the _selling price_, a single competitor would\r\nbe sufficient to break any combination. Of course the lease should\r\nspecify a minimum product which the mine should furnish.\r\n\r\nIt would be advisable, too, that a manifest duty of the government,\r\nwhich should be undertaken even under present conditions, should be\r\nobserved. It should be required to work the mine with due attention to\r\nsaving the greatest possible amount of ore or mineral contained in the\r\nseam or vein.\r\n\r\nThe third class of monopolies, whose legal subjection to public control\r\nis acknowledged, are those connected with our municipal public works.\r\nThere is already a widespread movement toward taking the control and\r\noperation of these out of the hands of private corporations, and placing\r\nit directly with the city government, and progress in this direction is\r\nvery rapid. The author believes, however, that the general law already\r\nstated is applicable here. If the public works of States and of the\r\nnation are more economically and efficiently managed when in the hands\r\nof private parties, it is surely unwise, as a general rule, to entrust\r\nthe operation of municipal works to the average city official. While it\r\nis in the highest degree desirable that water-works, gas, and\r\nelectric-lighting plants, street railways, and the other municipal\r\nenterprises, discussed in Chapter V., should be _owned_ by the\r\nmunicipality, their operation, in cases where the employment of\r\nconsiderable labor and the carrying on of intricate business and\r\nmechanical operations is involved, should in general be entrusted to\r\nprivate companies. In every case where the financial condition of the\r\nmunicipality obliges it to rely at first upon private corporations for\r\nthe construction and ownership of its public works, the franchise should\r\nexpire at the end of a short term of years, and the city should then\r\nhave the privilege of purchasing the works at their actual cost.\r\n\r\nAs regards works for water supply, there can be little doubt that almost\r\ninvariably the municipality should operate as well as own the works, for\r\nthe administration of the works requires but a small amount of labor,\r\nand that of such a class that the city can safely carry it on. But gas\r\nor electric-light plants, both for street and resident lighting, should\r\nbe operated by private companies.\r\n\r\nThese industries are making such rapid progress in the way of new\r\nprocesses, effecting both economy and improvement, that it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to say what steps should be taken. Many are of the opinion\r\nthat gas is destined to be entirely replaced by the electric light; but\r\nwhile this may eventually prove true, it will probably be a very long\r\ntime before the existing gas-works cease to supply consumers. Thus the\r\ntrue solution of the problem seems to be that when a growing town\r\nnowadays wishes to establish a new lighting plant of its own, it should\r\nadopt electricity. But in the case of a town having gas-works already\r\nestablished, the municipality is safe in assuming their ownership.\r\n\r\nAs regards the operation of lighting plants in small towns, it would\r\ndoubtless be best to lease the plant for short terms of years to the\r\nhighest bidder, making sure that the call for proposals is widely\r\ncirculated. Great cities, however, would find this policy\r\nunsatisfactory. If a ten-year lease of the Philadelphia gas-works, for\r\ninstance, were advertised for sale to the highest bidder, there would be\r\nbut few really close bidders upon it, and the danger of \"a combination\r\nto defeat competition\" would be great. It is at least worth considering\r\nwhether such a plan as we proposed for railways could not be made\r\nfeasible here. Let a corporation be chartered to operate the lighting\r\nplant of the city, and let the charter of the corporation provide that\r\nits rates shall be such as to pay an annual dividend upon its capital\r\nstock (fixed by law and not changeable) equal to the legal rate of\r\ninterest in the State. Provided, that in no case should the rates be\r\nlowered unless the net profits in one year were more than 2 per cent. in\r\nexcess of this rate, and that the excess for two consecutive years was\r\nmore than 1½ per cent. in excess of this rate. Provided also, that in no\r\ncase should the rates be raised unless the deficit exceeded 1½ per cent.\r\nin any year, and 1 per cent. for two consecutive years, and that it\r\nshould be proven by the company that it had exercised all reasonable\r\ndiligence, care, and economy in the management and operation of its\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nA certain proportion of the stock--less than a majority--should be held\r\nby the city; and the mayor should appoint directors to represent the\r\ncity, at least one of whom should be personally conversant with the\r\nindustry carried on by the company.\r\n\r\nAlthough not often so considered, the matter of passenger transportation\r\nis a much more important matter in our greatest cities than either\r\nlighting or water supply. The laboring man, who has to pay perhaps\r\ntwelve cents for the necessary ride back and forth to his work every\r\nday, feels this tax most severely. Suppose that under such an\r\narrangement for street railways as we have outlined for gas and electric\r\nlighting companies the fare would be reduced to three cents. His savings\r\nfrom this source would amount to at least $18 per year. Counting the\r\nextra rides and those which his wife and children have to take, the\r\nannual saving would probably reach $25, a sum which to the average\r\nlaboring man with a family dependent upon him means a great deal.\r\n\r\nOur municipal monopolies are now taxing us that they may pay swollen\r\ndividends on millions of dollars of fictitious capital. It is quite time\r\nthat the public recovered possession of the valuable franchises which\r\nare its rightful property, and managed them for its own benefit. The\r\nlegal difficulties in regaining the title to these franchises are\r\ncertainly not insuperable, and the readjustment of capitalization can be\r\nmade on the principle outlined in the case of steam railways. To\r\nillustrate: The city of \"Polis\" purchases the works which supply it with\r\nwater from the private company owning them, paying the average market\r\nvalue of the stock and bonds during five years past, which amounts,\r\nperhaps, to one and one half times the cost of the works. The revenue\r\nfrom the works has been sufficient, probably, to pay 8 per cent. on\r\nthese securities. The city issues 3 per cent. ten-year bonds to raise\r\nfunds for the purchase, and it then operates the works so as to gain a\r\nyearly revenue of 6 per cent., or 2 per cent. less than that gained by\r\nthe private company. At the end of ten years the surplus income from the\r\nworks is enough to pay more than one third the bonded indebtedness; and,\r\nif desired, the rest may be reissued as new bonds to run for a long\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe three classes of monopolies just discussed--railways, mineral\r\nwealth, and municipal works--include practically all the monopolies\r\nwhich are generally acknowledged to be subject to the public control by\r\nvirtue of their use of natural agents or the exercise of franchises\r\ngranted by the public.\r\n\r\nWe will next consider the monopolies in trade, in manufacturing, and\r\nin the purchase and sale of labor, to see what steps should be taken\r\nto protect them from encroaching on the rights of the people. In\r\nexercising the right of the people at large to take control of these\r\npurely private industries from the hands of their owners, we are\r\nassuming a power which, like a strong medicine, may be as potent for\r\nevil as for good. Only extreme necessity should sanction its use, and\r\nits abuse must be carefully guarded against. It is not saying too much\r\nto assert that the abuse of this power has already become an evil. We\r\nhave become so used to legislation for the benefit of special\r\nindustries, that legislation for their injury does not seem to be\r\nregarded as the exercise of a dangerous prerogative. Thus we are\r\nthreatened with a flood of laws to fix the prices in various industries\r\nnow subject to monopoly, or to crush them out altogether by enacting\r\nsome restrictive measure,--legislation which, by its directness, is apt\r\nto strike the average lawmaker very favorably, but which, it needs\r\nlittle wisdom to see, is the sure forerunner of abuses. The author\r\ntrusts that nothing in this book may be construed as advocating or\r\ndefending some of the crude and ill-considered attempts at anti-monopoly\r\nlegislation already made, or that may be made in the future.\r\n\r\nWe have proven in the preceding chapters that, from the character of\r\nmodern concentrated industry, a very large number of our manufactures\r\nmust either exist as monopolies or else must engage in intense and\r\nwasteful competition. If the monopoly can be so managed that it shall\r\ncarry on the industry economically, adopt improvements, keep up the\r\ncharacter of its product, and keep the prices therefor so low as to make\r\nno more than ordinary profits, it would be for the public advantage that\r\nmonopolies rather than competition should exist. Can we regulate\r\nmonopolies to secure such results? If so, our problem will be solved.\r\n\r\nThe author has proposed for the first class of monopolies--those\r\nobtaining the benefit of natural agents and public franchises--government\r\nownership of fixed capital and regulation of prices, with private\r\noperation and general management. But he is far from believing that such\r\na plan would now be wise for regulating trusts. It may indeed be that,\r\nat some time in the future, many of the great staple manufactures will\r\nbe formally established by the government as monopolies, and controlled\r\nin a similar way to that which we have outlined for the railway system;\r\nbut it is so far in the future that we need not consider it in detail\r\nnow. Under our present political organization it would be practically\r\nimpossible for the government to undertake to regulate justly and\r\nequitably such an industry, for instance, as the steel-rail manufacture.\r\nWe have set our State, national, and municipal governments a hard enough\r\ntask in the preceding pages of this chapter, in bringing under public\r\ncontrol our monopolies of transportation and communication and our\r\nproductive mines; and although it is a work possible of accomplishment,\r\nit will need good statesmanship to carry it out. By the time that task\r\nis accomplished, a similar plan, improved as experience will then\r\nsuggest, may perhaps be found available for the regulation of the\r\nimportant manufacturing industries.\r\n\r\nWe decide, then, that it is for the public advantage at present that\r\nboth the ownership and operation of manufacturing industries and of\r\ntrade must remain in private hands. The next question is, will the\r\ngreatest advantage to the public be secured by starting a crusade to\r\nre-establish competition and break up all existing monopolies in\r\nmanufacturing and trade; or by taking the opposite course, legalizing\r\nmonopolies and so regulating them by law that they shall be prevented\r\nfrom making undue profits by laying an exorbitant tax upon the public?\r\n\r\nPractically all the efforts made or proposed thus far for remedying the\r\nevils of monopolies in manufacturing and trade have had for their\r\npurpose the re-establishment of competition. The investigation to which\r\nthe first part of this book was devoted shows the wide extent of the\r\nmovement to restrict competition. Is it possible to wholly counteract\r\nthis? All our study of the laws of competition seems to show that the\r\ntendency of modern competition is to destroy itself by its own\r\nintensity. Certainly all the strenuous efforts to keep it alive by the\r\nforce of legal enactment and public opinion have thus far proved\r\nunavailing. There are now, probably, at least a million persons in the\r\nUnited States who are directly or indirectly interested in unlawful\r\ncontracts in restraint of competition; and among them are included many\r\nof the best financiers and most enterprising business men of the\r\ncountry. Certainly those who propose to drive these men into a renewal\r\nof competitive strife contrary to their will have set themselves a very\r\ndifficult task.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the opposite alternative. It cannot be a good thing to\r\nhave such a great proportion of the active business men of the country,\r\nwho bear the highest personal character, engaged in illegal contracts.\r\nLet us therefore take them within the pale of the law. They seem to be\r\ndetermined to make contracts with each other in restraint of\r\ncompetition; and believe, indeed, that they are forced to do it by\r\nmodern conditions of trade. Suppose we were to legalize these contracts\r\nand permit the establishment of monopolies. What can we then do to\r\nprotect the public from extortion in prices and adulteration in its\r\nproducts on the part of the monopoly?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, now that we have legalized monopolies there is no\r\nmore excuse for secrecy. To work in darkness and privacy befits\r\nlaw-breakers, but is needless for legitimate enterprises. Let the law\r\nprovide that every contract for the restriction of competition shall be\r\nin writing, and that a copy shall be filed, as a deed for real estate is\r\nfiled now, with the proper city or town officer where the property\r\naffected is situate, and also with the Secretary of State where the\r\ncontract is made. Certainly no honest man will object to this provision.\r\nThe contention has been made that contracts to restrict competition were\r\nnecessarily kept secret because they were \"without the pale of the law.\"\r\nVery well; we have legalized them. There can be no further defense of\r\nsecrecy. If any now refuse to make public their contracts to restrict\r\ncompetition, the refusal is evidence that the contract is for the injury\r\nof the public or some competitor and therefore properly punishable. We\r\nshall now know just what monopolies exist; just what is their strength,\r\nand for just how long a time their members are bound. Let us next see\r\nwhat measures we can adopt to prevent these legalized monopolies from\r\npractising extortion upon the public and abusing the power they have\r\ngained by the combination.\r\n\r\nThe first important means to secure this which the author would\r\nsuggest is simply an extension of the common-law principle of\r\nnon-discrimination. A man in conducting certain sorts of business is\r\npermitted to do as he chooses. He may sell to one person and refuse to\r\nsell to another; he may give to one and withhold from another. But if he\r\nenters business as the keeper of an inn or as a common carrier of\r\npassengers or freight, he can no longer exercise partiality. He has\r\n_elected to become a necessary servant of the public_, and as such he is\r\nbound to serve impartially all who apply. In the same way a manufacturer\r\nwhile he engages in business under the usual laws of competition, may\r\nsell to whom he pleases and exercise such preference as he chooses. But\r\nwhen he combines with all other manufacturers of the same sort in a\r\ncombination to restrict competition, he and his allies voluntarily\r\nchange their relation to the public. Is it not true that they do\r\nactually _elect to become necessary servants of the public_--far more\r\nnecessary, indeed, than the inn-keeper or the stage-coach driver,--and\r\nought they not therefore to be placed under similar legal restrictions?\r\n\r\nIn every case where combination or consolidation restricts competition\r\nin an industry, one effect produced is an increase in the power over\r\nthe public which the industry possesses. But this increased power over\r\nthe public, thus voluntarily assumed, must inevitably carry with it\r\nincreased responsibility to the public. It is the duty of the government\r\nto see that this responsibility is legally enforced.\r\n\r\nThis first principle, then, should be embodied in a law providing, in\r\nsubstance, that every person or firm entering into a contract to\r\nrestrict competition should, so long as that contract was in force, be\r\ndebarred from showing any preference in his or its purchases and sales,\r\nby giving more or less favorable prices to any person or firm than those\r\nquoted to any other person or firm. To enforce this requirement and\r\nprevent its evasion it is necessary to provide also that prices shall be\r\npublic and that they shall not be altered without due notice. The\r\nrequirement of publicity might be best effected by providing that the\r\ncontract restricting competition should contain a schedule of prices,\r\nwhich would usually be the case in any event.\r\n\r\nWhile this may seem like quite an assumption of authority on the part of\r\nthe State, it is exactly what trusts and trade associations are striving\r\nto effect, though with the important qualification that when occasion,\r\nin the shape of an obnoxious competitor, requires, they wish to be at\r\nliberty to put prices up or down at short notice and exercise their\r\npreferences as they choose.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what we would effect by the enforcement of this principle\r\nof non-discrimination. We have explained in the chapter on combinations\r\nin trade how one monopoly gains strength by alliance with another; as\r\nwhen the firms belonging to the car-spring combination made a contract\r\nwith the steel combination by which that monopoly agreed to sell to\r\nthem at a reduced price and to make an extra rate to their competitors.\r\nUnder this law it would be impossible to found one monopoly upon the\r\nfavors of another in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe obnoxious trade boycott, too, which is now becoming so common, would\r\nbe effectually checked. And the scheme for crushing out a rival by\r\ngiving all his customers specially favorable rates would no longer be\r\npracticable. The fact is that if we can stop the discriminations which\r\nthe monopolies have practised, we shall cure a large share of the evils\r\nthey have caused. It may be said that the courts will already punish\r\nmany conspiracies of this sort; but a monopoly which is already breaking\r\nthe law by its contracts of combination, finds in its methods of doing\r\nbusiness plenty of chances to evade the laws against conspiracy.\r\nCertainly with a properly drawn law with reference to the publicity and\r\nstability of prices, it should be possible to practically wipe out the\r\nevil of discrimination by monopolies. It is also to be noted that the\r\nrequirement of non-discrimination and of public and stable prices would\r\nbring profit in doing away with the waste of competition.\r\n\r\nWe have now to inquire what means it is possible to take to ensure that\r\nthe prices charged by the monopoly shall not only be the same to all,\r\nbut that they shall not in themselves be so exorbitant that the monopoly\r\nwill reap large profits at the public expense. How can we keep the\r\nprices charged by the monopoly from rising far above the point where\r\nthey would stand if free competition were in force? Two methods are open\r\nto us. We may keep down the monopoly's rates by what we will call\r\n_potential_ competition, or we may reduce them directly by legislative\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\nThe right of the public to take this latter course may be defended on\r\nthe ground that the monopoly has voluntarily made itself a necessary\r\npublic servant, and in that capacity offers to the public its goods.\r\nWhile it is true that the people permit the monopoly to become a\r\nnecessary public servant and protect it in the contracts by which it\r\nrestricts competition, it is also true that the monopoly cannot justly\r\nmake merchandise of the necessities of the people. The public may allow\r\na combination to obtain control of all the sugar refineries, for\r\ninstance, and protect the combination in its formation. But suppose the\r\nowners of the combination then say: \"The people are obliged to have\r\nsugar and we control the supply. We will set a high price on sugar,\r\ntherefore, because we know that they will pay it rather than go\r\nwithout.\" They are then making the necessity of the public a source of\r\ngain, and it cannot be believed that this will be permanently suffered.\r\n\r\nThe serious difficulty in fixing by direct government action the prices\r\nwhich a monopoly of this sort shall charge, is that we cannot stop at\r\nthat point. When once the government steps in to do so radical a thing\r\nas to fix the price which a monopoly shall charge, it becomes in equity\r\nresponsible to the owners of that monopoly for the maintenance of their\r\nincomes from their capital invested. If their profits have been so\r\nreduced by this action as to seriously injure the value of their\r\nproperty, they have a legal right to claim compensation from the state\r\nfor the injury it has done them. And in almost every case they would set\r\nup the claim that their property had been thus injured. To determine the\r\npoint at which reasonable prices and reasonable profits become\r\nextortionate prices and unjust profits is a task requiring expert\r\nknowledge and the most comprehensive judgment, aided by the most\r\naccurate statistics. To impose this task on our already overburdened\r\ncourts would permanently block the wheels of justice, and would give to\r\nthe judicial department of government a work which its machinery is\r\nwholly unsuited to carry on.\r\n\r\nIt seems evident, therefore, that when it becomes necessary for the\r\nstate to directly fix prices to be charged by monopolies, a more radical\r\nstep should be taken. The monopoly should be established on a permanent\r\nbasis, and the state should have some part in its direct control.\r\n\r\nDiscarding, therefore, direct action by the state to fix prices as\r\ninexpedient, for the present, at least, let us see what we can effect by\r\nmeans of \"potential\" competition, which term we will use to signify that\r\ncompetition which may be established in any monopolized industry if the\r\ninducements offered are sufficiently great. It must be remembered that\r\nnowadays men of capital and enterprise are always on the look-out for\r\nevery opportunity to invest money and expend their industry where it\r\nwill bring the greatest returns. If any monopoly seems to be making\r\nlarge returns, people are generally ready to believe that it is making\r\ntwice as great profits as it really is; and some one is quite likely to\r\nstart in as a competitor, if there is a prospect of large profits. Now\r\nwe wish to do two things. We wish to make it so easy for new competitors\r\nto enter the field against a monopoly that its managers will keep their\r\nprofits down in order not to call in any new competitors. We also wish\r\nto so modify the intensity of competition between the monopoly and the\r\nnew competitor that the latter may have a chance at least of being\r\nrepaid for its expenditure in entering the field. The simplest and best\r\nof the legal provisions which we may enforce to this end is the one\r\nalready stated of non-discrimination. The monopoly can no longer reduce\r\nits price to apply to only the limited field in which the new competitor\r\nworks, but must reduce its prices everywhere to meet those made by the\r\nrival. In the case of monopolies in trade and all monopolies in\r\nmanufacturing in which the fixed capital required is but small, this is\r\nall that would be needed to encourage the establishment of new\r\ncompetitors and discourage the monopoly from grasping after undue\r\nprofits from the public.\r\n\r\nIn the case of those manufacturing monopolies in which a large fixed\r\ncapital must be invested at the start by any new competitor, we have a\r\nmuch more difficult problem. It is true that in this case the monopoly\r\nitself has more at stake; and this may induce the starting up of new\r\ncompetitors simply to be bought out by the trust,--a sort of\r\nblackmailing operation which is certainly repugnant in its character. It\r\nmight be possible to provide that rates charged by the monopoly must be\r\nso stable that a competitor would have a chance to establish itself\r\nbefore the monopoly could bring its own rates down. It might be possible\r\nto force the monopoly to keep all its factories in operation, and thus\r\noblige it to keep down its price in order to dispose of its products;\r\nbut there are evident practical difficulties in the way of enforcing\r\nsuch laws. It seems a great pity that just now, when to find some\r\nemployment of prison convicts in some manner that will not \"compete with\r\nfree labor,\" and thus displease the labor interests, seems an\r\nimpossibility, we cannot set the convicts at work to compete with the\r\ntrusts and bring down their profits to a reasonable point. Surely the\r\nlabor party would find no fault with this use of convict competition.\r\n\r\nThere is one step, however, which we can take, and whose effect would\r\ncertainly be very great; in its desirability, apart from questions of\r\nmonopoly, all honest men are practically united. We can reform our laws\r\nregarding corporate management. It is a mild arraignment compared to\r\nwhat is deserved, to say that our present laws regarding the formation\r\nand management of corporations, taking the country as a whole, are a\r\nshame to the people and a disgrace to the men who made them. They seem\r\ndesigned to place a premium on fraud and knavery, and to assist the\r\nprofessional projector and stock manipulator in reaping gains from\r\ninnocent--generally very innocent--stockholders. Now a real reform in\r\nour corporation laws would greatly simplify our work in controlling\r\nmonopolies. Let us have no more stock-watering of any sort at any time\r\nin a corporation's life. Let us have no more \"income bonds\" which yield\r\nno income, and \"preferred stock\" in which another is preferred after\r\nall. Two classes of securities are enough for an honest corporation, and\r\nthe public interest requires the charter of no other class of companies.\r\nLet us have done, too, with the iniquitous custom of one corporation\r\nholding another's stock or bonds. With a few such simple reforms as\r\nthese effected, the holders of stock in our corporations would have some\r\nidea where they stand and what their securities represent, and would\r\ntake some interest in the control of their property.\r\n\r\nWith these reforms, in the case of every corporation making a contract\r\nto restrict competition, it would be required that the company make\r\npublic annually a full statement of its receipts, expenditures, and\r\nprofits. Every monopoly would stand before the public then in its true\r\nposition, and every one would know if it were making 50 per cent. per\r\nannum on the actual capital invested, or only 5 per cent. With these\r\nfacts made public, if any monopoly ventured to raise its price till it\r\nreaped unusual profits, some of the heaviest consumers of the\r\nmonopolized product would be very apt to start a factory of their own in\r\nopposition. It is to be remembered that under the law of\r\n_non-discrimination_ the monopolies would be prevented from currying\r\nfavor with the large consumers by giving them specially favorable\r\nprices. It is now common to do this, as it removes the danger of\r\ncombination among these important customers to compete with the\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the chief features of the plan proposed for the control of\r\nmonopolies in manufacture and trade are as follows: Make contracts to\r\nrestrict competition, legal and binding, instead of illegal and void as\r\nnow. _But_; provide that every such contract shall be filed for public\r\ninspection; that prices charged by the combination shall be public,\r\nstable, and absolutely unvarying to all; that the affairs of the\r\ncombination shall be managed according to a consistent and stringent\r\ncorporation law; and that an annual report of the operations of the\r\ncombination be made to a public commission.\r\n\r\nContrast this with the existing law upon this important subject. In\r\nJudge Barrett's decision in the Sugar Trust case he said:\r\n\r\n     \"The development of judicial thought, in regard to contracts in\r\n     restraint of trade, has been especially marked. The ancient\r\n     doctrine upon that head has been weakened and modified to such a\r\n     degree that but little if any of it is left. Indeed, excessive\r\n     competition may sometimes result in actual injury to the public;\r\n     and anti-competitive contracts, to avert personal ruin, may be\r\n     perfectly reasonable. It is only when such contracts are publicly\r\n     oppressive that they become unreasonable, and are condemned as\r\n     against public policy.\"\r\n\r\nThis is probably the best statement of the present status of the common\r\nlaw upon this subject now extant. But what a path to endless litigation\r\ndoes it open! Who shall draw the line where a contract to restrain\r\ncompetition ceases to be beneficial and lawful, and becomes an injury to\r\nthe public welfare? Must this be left to judge and jury? If so, the\r\nresponsibilities of our already overburdened Courts are vastly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with such a policy as this, the plan before presented\r\ncertainly promises definiteness in the place of uncertainty; and treats\r\nall contracts in restraint of competition with impartiality. It is\r\nbelieved that the effect of its enforcement would be a great reduction\r\nin the tax now levied on us by monopolies.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one way, however, in which all these monopolies that we\r\nhave found it so difficult to devise a plan to deal with--the\r\nmanufacturers' trusts--may be quickly and certainly reduced. Our heavy\r\ntariff on imported goods, by protecting manufacturers from foreign\r\ncompetition, and thus reducing the number of possible competitors, has\r\nundeniably been a chief reason why trusts have appeared and grown\r\nwealthy in this country before any other. The author has purposely\r\nrefrained, as far as possible, from reference to the relation of the\r\ntariff to monopolies; for the question has been so hotly fought over,\r\nand the real facts concerning it have been so garbled and distorted,\r\nthat people are not yet ready to consider it in an unprejudiced way.\r\nThis much, however, no one can gainsay. We hold in our hands the means\r\nto at any time reduce the prices and profits of practically all our\r\nmonopolies in manufacturing to a reasonable basis, by simply cutting\r\ndown the duty on the products of foreign manufactories. Now, if after\r\nour plan just described is in force, the managers of any monopoly choose\r\nto be so reckless as to raise its prices to a point where its published\r\nreports will show it to be making enormous profits, thus tempting new\r\ncompetitors to enter the field and breeding public hostility, all honest\r\nprotectionists and free-traders will be quite apt to unite in a demand\r\nthat the \"protection\" under which this monopoly is permitted to tax the\r\npublic be taken away.\r\n\r\nIf only we could find in any possible plan so excellent a solution of\r\nthe problem of labor monopolies as a reduction of the tariff offers us\r\nin the case of trusts! The question is so complex a one that it is\r\nhardly possible to consider it here, except very briefly. Certainly, if\r\nwe legalize combinations to restrict competition among capitalists, we\r\nshould among laborers as well. Indeed, the decay of the old common-law\r\nprinciple, that such contracts were against public policy, and that such\r\ncombinations were punishable, has been more marked in the case of trade\r\nunions than anywhere else. Besides this, as long as employers have the\r\nright to kill competition in the purchase of labor, workmen should\r\ncertainly have the right to avoid competition in its sale. But to\r\nprevent by force other competitors from taking the field, if they\r\nchoose, against any labor combination, is an infringement of the\r\npersonal liberty guaranteed to every man by the Constitution, and can by\r\nno means be lawfully permitted.\r\n\r\nIf workingmen only understood how much the apparent gain when they win\r\nin a strike is overbalanced by their loss in the higher prices which\r\nthey have to pay for the necessaries of life, and in the reduced demand\r\nfor labor, they would be as anxious to protect capital as they now\r\nare--some of them--to injure it. The strikes make timid the men who have\r\ncapital to invest. They will not loan their money to business men,\r\nbuilders, manufacturers, or any one who wishes to use it to employ\r\nworkmen, except at a higher rate of interest, to pay for the increased\r\nrisk. _Hence_, the cost of the capital used in production is greater,\r\nand the price the public has to pay for the product must be greater.\r\n\r\nAgain, when men have to pay higher rates of interest for the money they\r\nborrow they are slower to engage in new enterprises. Mr. A. a builder,\r\nintended to put up a block of a dozen houses this season, which would\r\nhave tended to reduce rents; but the fear of strikes, with their\r\nattendant damage and loss, has prevented him from borrowing money at\r\nless than 8 per cent. interest. He concludes that, on the whole, this\r\nwill eat up so much of his profits that he will not build. Is it not too\r\nplain to need proof that the _moral influence_ alone of the strikes has\r\nrobbed the workmen at every point? And this is one of a thousand cases\r\nin a hundred different industries.\r\n\r\nThe plans we have discussed for the treatment of monopolies have for\r\ntheir object a benefit to the people at large, by enabling them to\r\npurchase the products of industry and of natural wealth free from the\r\ntax now levied upon them by monopolies. If we can effect this, we shall\r\nnot have a millennium; there will still be injustice and suffering\r\nenough in the world; but we shall have reduced the pressure upon the men\r\nwho work with their hands for their daily bread, enough so that we shall\r\nno longer see the strange spectacle of over-production and hunger and\r\nnakedness existing side by side. Men's desires were made by an All-wise\r\nCreator to be always in advance of their ability to gratify them. And\r\nthe commercial supply of that ability--the supply of men willing to\r\nwork--ought always to be behind the demand for men.\r\n\r\nIt seems beyond dispute, then, that whatever will remove these\r\nobstructions to the wheels of production will increase the demand for\r\nlabor, as well as increase the wages of labor by lowering the prices of\r\nthe necessaries of life. This the plan we have discussed promises to do,\r\nand it also promises to benefit the whole people by lowering the cost of\r\nmonopolized articles.\r\n\r\nThe men and women who work with their hands, and those dependent on\r\nthem, form 97 per cent. of the population of the country. Instead of\r\ncombining to stop production in this shop or that factory, why not join\r\nhands to work for reforms in the interest of the whole people? Be sure\r\nthat in so doing, organized labor will have the hearty co-operation, and\r\nleadership if need be, of the best men in every class of society.\r\n\r\nBut while the reforms proposed promise great and important benefits to\r\nthe workers on whom the tax laid by monopoly falls most cruelly, the\r\nquestion, \"What shall fix the rate of wages, if competition cannot?\" is\r\nstill left undecided. The best answer the author can make to this is as\r\nfollows: The monopoly formed by the trade unions in the sale of labor is\r\nunnatural, because the number of competing units is great instead of\r\nsmall. As new competitors must continually arise, the monopoly can never\r\nbe successful without the use of unlawful means. If it raises the price\r\nof labor above what free competition would determine, it as truly lays a\r\ntax on the whole people as did the copper monopoly. On the other hand,\r\nwe must recognize the fact that competition is now often absent in the\r\n_purchase_ of labor, and this is a chief and sufficient cause for the\r\nexisting attempts to kill competition in its sale. But this is largely\r\ndue to the fact that the supply of labor is now in excess of the demand.\r\nWhen instead of signs everywhere, \"No one need apply for employment\r\nhere,\" we see placards, \"Men wanted; high prices to good workmen,\" then\r\ncompetition will assert itself in the purchase of labor.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first class of industries, those utilizing natural\r\nagents, which we proposed to place under the care of the state, it is\r\nevident that we can permit no strikes there. Our transportation lines,\r\nour mines, our gas-works, our water supplies, are to be operated for the\r\nbenefit of the whole people, and no labor monopoly can be permitted to\r\nstop them. The plan that might be adopted to prevent interruptions in\r\nthese industries has been already referred to. The author would suggest\r\na similar plan for the benefit of labor in general. Suppose that in the\r\ncharter of a manufacturing corporation, a certain portion of the stock\r\nin small-sized shares was set aside for the employés required to operate\r\nthe mill. Let each employé be _required_ to hold a certain number of\r\nshares in proportion to his wages; to purchase them when he begins to\r\nwork, and to return them when he leaves the service of the corporation;\r\nthe price in all cases to be par. In case he leaves without giving a\r\ncertain notice, he should forfeit a certain proportion of his stock. If,\r\non the other hand, he is discharged without an equal notice, he should\r\nreceive the full amount of his stock, and a sum in addition equal to the\r\npenalty which he would have incurred had he broken the contract. Who\r\nwill deny that such a move would be vastly to the interest of both\r\nparties, the employer and employed. Is not a protection needed by the\r\nworkman against the power of the employer to turn him adrift at any time\r\nwithout a penny?\r\n\r\nFinally it must be said that the labor question, more than any other\r\nconnected with monopoly, needs solution through the influence of the\r\nprinciples of Christian fraternity. In the last analysis, every man\r\nsells to his brother men his service and receives his food, clothing,\r\nand shelter in return. We may execute justice never so well, and\r\nregulate never so nicely the wages of men by the law of supply and\r\ndemand, there will still be special cases demanding and deserving to be\r\ntreated by the rules of brotherly charity. The strong were given their\r\npower that they might aid the feeble; and they who fall behind in the\r\nstruggle for position are not to be blotted out by the brute law of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest, but cared for as the noblest instincts of\r\nhumanity prompt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the indictment which conservative critics will be\r\napt to bring against the plans for the equitable control of monopolies\r\npresented in this chapter is that they are too novel, and that they\r\nrequire too much of an upheaval of existing institutions for their\r\naccomplishment. The conservative man is invariably in favor of getting\r\nalong with things as they are. The answer to be made to this is, that no\r\ncandid man who will make a thorough study of the present status of\r\nmonopoly and of the attempts to control it can be conservative. The\r\npresent status of monopolies is just neither to their owners nor to the\r\npublic. They are plundering the public as much or as little as they\r\nchoose; and the sovereign people are submitting to it and taking their\r\nrevenge by passing retaliatory laws intended to ruin the monopolies if\r\npossible. These legislative \"strikes\" are thus especially well\r\ncalculated to foster extortion on the part of the owners of monopolies,\r\nwho naturally wish to make what profits they can before some piece of\r\nlegislation is put through to destroy the industry they have built up.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this are the plans proposed in this chapter. They offer\r\nto establish a definite relation between the public and the monopolies,\r\nand a permanent and stable foundation for each industry they affect in\r\nplace of the present fickle and ever changing one.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of critics who may complain that the plan\r\nproposed leaves too much power still in the hands of the monopolists,\r\nand gives the government too small a part in their management. The\r\nanswer to this is very evident. We have found the cardinal value of the\r\nsystem of individual competition to be that it tends by a process of\r\nnatural selection to bring the men of greatest ability into the control\r\nand management of our industries; while the vital weakness in the\r\nmanagement of industry by government is the fact that the sovereign\r\npeople does not choose the wisest and most honest men to control its\r\naffairs. Men may well say that if they are to be robbed it had better be\r\nby a corporation, where innocent stockholders will receive part of the\r\nbenefit, than by dishonest officials of government.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate remedy for the evils of monopoly, therefore, lies with the\r\npeople. When they will choose to control their affairs the men of\r\ngreatest wisdom and honor; when each man will exercise the same care in\r\nchoosing men to care for the public business that he does in caring for\r\nhis own private interests, then we can safely trust far greater\r\nresponsibilities to our government than is now prudent.\r\n\r\nThere is no more important lesson to impress on the minds of the toiling\r\nmillions who are growing restless under the burdens of monopoly than\r\nthis: The only remedy for monopoly is control; the only power that can\r\ncontrol is government; and to have a government fit to assume these\r\nmomentous duties, all good men and true must join hands to put only men\r\nof wisdom and honor in places of public trust.\r\n\r\nThere is a virtue which shone in all brightness when this nation was\r\nborn, not alone in the hearts of the commander-in-chief and his brother\r\nheroes, but in the hearts of the men and women who gave themselves to\r\ntheir country's service. It glowed with all fervor when, a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago, the North fought to sustain what the fathers had created,\r\nand the rank and file of the South gave their lives and all they had for\r\nwhat they deemed a righteous and noble cause. Though the robust spirit\r\nof partisanship may seem for a time to have crowded out from men's\r\nhearts the love of their country, surely that love still remains; and in\r\nthe days of new import which dawn upon us, in the virtue of PATRIOTISM\r\nwill be found a sufficient antidote for the vice of _monopoly_.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Transcriber's Note and Errata                                |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | Some tables have been reformatted for clarity.               |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | One instance of an oe ligature has been expanded to 'oe'.    |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | The following typographical errors have been corrected:      |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | |particularly |particular  |                                 |\r\n  | |1888,        |1888.       |                                 |\r\n  | |succcessful  |successful  |                                 |\r\n  | |ascendency   |ascendancy  |                                 |\r\n  | |quenced      |quenched    |                                 |\r\n  | |accomodate   |accommodate |                                 |\r\n  | |owership     |ownership   |                                 |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | The following words were hyphenated in varying fashion in    |\r\n  |   the text:                                                  |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | |bond-holders (1)     |bondholders (1)    |                  |\r\n  | |midle-men (1)        |middlemen (2)      |                  |\r\n  | |over-estimate (1)    |overestimate (1)   |                  |\r\n  | |over-production (16) |overproduction (1) |                  |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Monopolies and the People, by Charles Whiting Baker",
