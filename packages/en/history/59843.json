BURT, PRINTER,\r\n  HOLBORN HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY AND INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE.--This Division of the Guide-Book contains the _Index to\r\n  Principal Objects_; and the _Company’s Official Announcements_; with\r\n  the _Refreshment Tariff_; an _Introduction_ to the General Guide-book;\r\n  and an _Account of the Building_.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n  The arrangement of the present edition has been made with the view of\r\n  simplifying, as much as possible, the reference to particular objects;\r\n  as well as of enabling the visitor to regularly explore with advantage\r\n  every portion of the Crystal Palace. The splendid Botanical\r\n  Collection, now thoroughly acclimatised, and very complete, is\r\n  described as fully as the nature of the book will permit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO ORIGINAL EDITION.\r\n\r\nThe following pages are presented to the public as a brief but connected\r\nand carefully prepared account of the exterior and interior of the\r\nCrystal Palace. It is believed that no important or interesting object\r\nin connexion with the Exhibition is without its record in this little\r\nvolume; although, in so vast a collection of works of architecture,\r\nsculpture, and industrial manufacture, it is clearly impossible to\r\ncompress within the limits of a General Hand-book all the information\r\nwhich is necessary to satisfy the visitor desirous of precise and\r\naccurate knowledge of the numberless objects offered to his\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nA general and comprehensive view of the Crystal Palace will\r\nunquestionably be obtained by the perusal of the present manual. The\r\nHand-books of the respective departments will supply all the detailed\r\ninformation necessary to fill in the broad and rapidly drawn outlines.\r\nIn them, Literature will faithfully serve as the handmaiden to Art, and\r\ncomplete the great auxiliary work of education which it is the first aim\r\nof the Crystal Palace to effect.\r\n\r\nThese Hand-books are published at prices varying from three-pence to\r\neighteen-pence, according to the size of the volume. The lowest possible\r\nprice has been affixed to one and all. It may be fearlessly asserted\r\nthat books containing the same amount of entertainment, information, and\r\ninstruction, it would be difficult to purchase at a more reasonable rate\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINTED BY R.

Considerable damage has frequently\r\nbeen thus done by children, and serious noise and annoyance is caused by\r\ntheir _running along the galleries_, or _playing boisterously_--a\r\npractice which it is desirable to stop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBATH CHAIRS.\r\n\r\nWheel-chairs for invalids and others, may be hired in the building on\r\nthe following terms:--\r\n\r\n  Within the Palace, with Assistants   1_s._ 6_d._ per hour.\r\n  In the Grounds            „          2_s._ 6_d._    „\r\n    Without Assistants, 6_d._ less.\r\n  Perambulators                        0_s._ 6_d._    „\r\n  Double Perambulators                 1_s._ 0_d._    „\r\n\r\n  Lifting Chairs for carrying Invalids up the stairs from the Railway\r\n  Station, or to the Galleries, 1_s._\r\n\r\nThe principal stand is near the entrance to the building, from the\r\nrailways. Visitors can also be conveyed by these chairs to any hotel or\r\nresidence in Sydenham or Norwood.\r\n\r\n  _Crystal Palace, May, 1859._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REFRESHMENT DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n  The various Saloons and Dining Rooms allotted for the Refreshment\r\n  Department are all situated at the South End of the Palace, but branch\r\n  stations for light refreshments will be found in various convenient\r\n  positions throughout the building, and on special occasions requiring\r\n  it, in the grounds.

The South Wing Dining Room is entered at the\r\n  left-hand corner of the extreme South End of the Palace, as the Saloon\r\n  is at the right-hand. It is the most spacious dining hall of the kind\r\n  in England, and is constructed entirely of glass and iron. The end and\r\n  the long façade next the gardens are fitted for the whole extent with\r\n  magnificent plate glass (which can be opened at convenience),\r\n  commanding, from the dinner tables, a perfect view of the Terraces,\r\n  Fountains, the Gardens, and the great prospect of rich landscape\r\n  beyond.

the Palace\r\nfrom the various parts of the great metropolis and its environs. The\r\nrailway communication is by the London and Brighton, and the West End\r\nRailways, which serve as the great main lines for the conveyance of\r\nvisitors by rail from London to the Palace doors.\r\n\r\nWe will presume that the visitor has taken his railway ticket, which,\r\nfor his convenience, includes admission within the Palace, and that his\r\ntwenty minutes’ journey has commenced. Before he alights, and whilst his\r\nmind is still unoccupied by the wonders that are to meet his eye, we\r\ntake the opportunity to relate, as briefly as we can, the History of the\r\nCrystal Palace, from the day upon which the Royal Commissioners\r\nassembled within its transparent walls to declare their great and\r\nsuccessful mission ended, until the 10th of June, 1854, when\r\nreconstructed, and renewed and beautified in all its proportions, it\r\nagain opened its wide doors to continue and confirm the good it had\r\nalready effected in the nation and beyond it.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the destination of the Great Exhibition\r\nbuilding occupied much public attention towards the close of 1851, and\r\nthat a universal regret prevailed at the threatened loss of a structure\r\nwhich had accomplished so much for the improvement of the national\r\ntaste, and which was evidently capable, under intelligent direction, of\r\neffecting so very much more. A special commission even had been\r\nappointed for the purpose of reporting on the different useful purposes\r\nto which the building could be applied, and upon the cost necessary to\r\ncarry them out. Further discussion on the subject, however, was rendered\r\nunnecessary by the declaration of the Home Secretary, on the 25th of\r\nMarch, 1852, that Government had determined not to interfere in any way\r\nwith the building, which accordingly remained, according to previous\r\nagreement, in the hands of Messrs. Fox and Henderson, the builders and\r\ncontractors. Notwithstanding the announcement of the Home Secretary, a\r\nlast public effort towards rescuing the Crystal Palace for its original\r\nsite in Hyde Park, was made by Mr. Heywood in the House of Commons, on\r\nthe 29th of April. But Government again declined the responsibility of\r\npurchasing the structure, and Mr. Heywood’s motion was, by a large\r\nmajority, lost.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Mr. Leech,[1] a private gentleman,\r\nconceived the idea of rescuing the edifice from destruction, and of\r\nrebuilding it on some appropriate spot, by the organisation of a private\r\ncompany. On communicating this view to his partner, Mr. Farquhar, he\r\nreceived from him a ready and cordial approval. They then submitted\r\ntheir project to Mr. Francis Fuller, who entering into their views,\r\nundertook and arranged, on their joint behalf, a conditional purchase\r\nfrom Messrs. Fox and Henderson, of the Palace as it stood. In the belief\r\nthat a building, so destined, would, if erected on a metropolitan line\r\nof railway, greatly conduce to the interests of the line, and that\r\ncommunication by railway was essential for the conveyance thither of\r\ngreat masses from London, Mr. Farquhar next suggested to Mr. Leo\r\nSchuster, a Director of the Brighton Railway, that a site for the new\r\nPalace should be selected on the Brighton line. Mr. Schuster, highly\r\napproving of the conception, obtained the hearty concurrence of Mr.\r\nLaing, the Chairman of the Brighton Board, and of his brother Directors,\r\nfor aiding as far as possible in the prosecution of the work. And,\r\naccordingly, these five gentlemen, and their immediate friends\r\ndetermined forthwith to complete the purchase of the building. On the\r\n24th of May, 1852, the purchase-money was paid, and a few English\r\ngentlemen became the owners of the Crystal Palace of 1851. Their names\r\nfollow:--\r\n\r\n_Original Purchasers of the Building._\r\n\r\n  MR. T. N. FARQUHAR,\r\n  MR. FRANCIS FULLER,\r\n  MR. ROBERT GILL,\r\n  MR. HARMAN GRISEWOOD,\r\n  MR. JOSEPH LEECH,\r\n  MR. J. C. MORICE,\r\n  MR. SCOTT RUSSELL,\r\n  MR. LEO SCHUSTER,\r\n  MR. SAMUEL LAING.\r\n\r\n  [1] Of the firm of Johnston, Farquhar, and Leech, Solicitors.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be supposed that these gentlemen had proceeded thus far\r\nwithout having distinctly considered the final destination of their\r\npurchase. They decided that the building--the first wonderful example of\r\na new style of architecture--should rise again greatly enhanced in\r\ngrandeur and beauty; that it should form a Palace for the multitude,\r\nwhere, at all times, protected from the inclement varieties of our\r\nclimate, healthful exercise and wholesome recreation should be easily\r\nattainable. To raise the enjoyments and amusements of the English\r\npeople, and especially to afford to the inhabitants of London, in\r\nwholesome country air, amidst the beauties of nature, the elevating\r\ntreasures of art, and the instructive marvels of science, an accessible\r\nand inexpensive substitute for the injurious and debasing amusements of\r\na crowded metropolis;--to blend for them instruction with pleasure, to\r\neducate them by the eye, to quicken and purify their taste by the habit\r\nof recognising the beautiful;--to place them amidst the trees, flowers,\r\nand plants of all countries and of all climates, and to attract them to\r\nthe study of the natural sciences, by displaying their most interesting\r\nexamples;--and making known all the achievements of modern industry, and\r\nthe marvels of mechanical manufactures;--such were some of the original\r\nintentions of the first promoters of this national undertaking.\r\n\r\nHaving decided upon their general design, and upon the scale on which it\r\nshould be executed, the Directors next proceeded to select the officers\r\nto whom the carrying out of the work should be entrusted. Sir JOSEPH\r\nPAXTON, the inventive architect of the great building in Hyde Park,was\r\nrequested to accept the office of Director of the Winter Garden, Park,\r\nand Conservatory, an office of which the duties became subsequently much\r\nmore onerous and extensive than the title implies. Mr. OWEN JONES and\r\nMr. DIGBY WYATT, who had distinguished themselves by their labours in\r\nthe old Crystal Palace, accepted the duties of Directors of the Fine Art\r\nDepartment, and of the decorations of the new structure. Mr. CHARLES\r\nWILD, the engineer of the old building, filled the same office in the\r\nnew one. Mr. GROVE, the secretary of the Society of Arts, the parent\r\ninstitution of the Exhibition of 1851, was appointed Secretary. Mr.\r\nSAMUEL PHILLIPS was made Director of the Literary Department. Mr.\r\nFRANCIS FULLER, a member of the Hyde Park Executive Committee, accepted\r\nthe duties of Managing Director, Mr. SAMUEL LAING, M.P., the chairman of\r\nthe Brighton Railway Company, became Chairman also of the New Crystal\r\nPalace, and Messrs. FOX and HENDERSON undertook the re-erection of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nWith these arrangements, a Company was formed, under the name of the\r\nCrystal Palace Company, and a prospectus issued, announcing the proposed\r\ncapital of £500,000, in one hundred thousand shares of £5 each. The\r\nfollowing gentlemen constituted the Board of Directors:--\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL LAING, Esq., M.P., Chairman.\r\n  ARTHUR ANDERSON, Esq.\r\n  E. S. P. CALVERT, Esq.\r\n  T. N. FARQUHAR, Esq.\r\n  CHARLES GEACH, Esq., M.P.\r\n  CHARLES LUSHINGTON, Esq.\r\n  J. SCOTT RUSSELL, Esq., F.R.S.\r\n  FRANCIS FULLER, Esq., Managing Director.\r\n\r\nThe present Board is constituted as follows:--\r\n\r\n  T. N. FARQUHAR, Esq., Chairman.\r\n  ARTHUR ANDERSON, Esq.\r\n  SAMUEL BEALE, Esq., M.P.\r\n  HENRY SANFORD BICKNELL, Esq.\r\n  GEORGE ENGLAND, Esq.\r\n  CHARLES HORSLEY, Esq.\r\n  A. C. IONIDES, Esq.\r\n  JAMES LOW, Esq.\r\n  DAVID OGILVY, Esq.\r\n  DAVID PRICE, Esq.\r\n  HENRY DANBY SEYMOUR, Esq., M.P.\r\n  CAPTAIN EDWARD WALTER.\r\n  Mr. P. K. BOWLEY is the present General Manager.\r\n\r\nIt will ever be mentioned to the credit of the English people, that\r\nwithin a fortnight after the issue of the Company’s prospectus the\r\nshares were taken up to an extent that gave the Directors ample\r\nencouragement to proceed vigorously with their novel and gigantic\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nIn the prospectus it was proposed to transfer the building to Sydenham,\r\nin Kent, and the site chosen was an irregular parallelogram of three\r\nhundred acres,[2] extending from the Brighton Railway to the road which\r\nforms the boundary of the Dulwich Wood at the top of the hill, the fall\r\nfrom which to the railway is two hundred feet. It was at once felt that\r\nthe summit of this hill was the only position, in all the ground, for\r\nthe great glass building: a position which, on the one side, commands a\r\nbeautiful view of the fine counties of Surrey and Kent, and on the other\r\na prospect of the great metropolis. This site was chosen, and we doubt\r\nwhether a finer is to be found so close to London, and so easy of access\r\nby means of railway. To facilitate the conveyance of passengers, the\r\nBrighton Railway Company--under special and mutually advantageous\r\narrangements--undertook to lay down a new line of rails between London\r\nand Sydenham, to construct a branch from the Sydenham station to the\r\nCrystal Palace garden, and to build a number of engines sufficiently\r\npowerful to draw heavy trains up the steep incline to the Palace.\r\n\r\n  [2] A portion of this land, not required for the purposes of the\r\n  Palace, has been disposed of.\r\n\r\nAnd now the plans were put into practical and working shape. The\r\nbuilding was to gain in strength and artistic effect, whilst the\r\ncontents of the mighty structure were to be most varied. Art was to be\r\nworthily represented by Architecture and Sculpture. Architectural\r\nrestorations were to be made, and Architectural specimens from the most\r\nremarkable edifices throughout the world, to be collected, in order to\r\npresent a grand architectural sequence from the earliest dawn of the art\r\ndown to the latest times. Casts of the most celebrated works of\r\nSculpture were to be procured: so that within the glass walls might be\r\nseen a vast historical gallery of this branch of art, from the time of\r\nthe ancient Egyptians to our own era. Nature, also, was to put forth her\r\nbeauty throughout the Palace and Grounds. A magnificent collection of\r\nplants of every land was to adorn the glass structure within, whilst in\r\nthe gardens the fountains of Versailles were to be outrivalled, and\r\nEnglishmen at length enabled to witness the water displays which for\r\nyears had proved a source of pleasure and recreation to foreigners in\r\ntheir own countries. Nor was this all. All those sciences, an\r\nacquaintance with which is attainable through the medium of the eye,\r\nwere allotted their specific place, and Geology, Ethnology, and Zoology\r\nwere taken as best susceptible of illustration; Professor Edward Forbes,\r\nDr. Latham, Professor Ansted, Mr. Waterhouse, Mr. Gould, and other\r\ngentlemen well known in the scientific world, undertaking to secure the\r\nmaterial basis upon which the intellectual service was to be grounded.\r\nTo prevent the monotony that attaches to a mere museum arrangement, in\r\nwhich glass cases are ordinarily the most prominent features, the whole\r\nof the collected objects, whether of science, art, or nature, were to be\r\narranged in picturesque groupings, and harmony was to reign throughout.\r\nTo give weight to their proceedings, and to secure lasting advantage to\r\nthe public, a charter was granted by Lord Derby’s Government on the 28th\r\nof January, 1853, binding the Directors and their successors to preserve\r\nthe high moral and social tone which, from the outset, they had assumed\r\nfor their National Institution.\r\n\r\nThe building paid for, the officers retained, the plans put on\r\npaper--Messrs. Fox and Henderson received instructions to convey the\r\nPalace to its destined home at Sydenham, and the work of removal now\r\ncommenced. The first column of the new structure was raised by Mr.\r\nLaing, M.P., the Chairman of the Company, on the 5th August, 1852; the\r\nworks were at once proceeded with, and the most active and strenuous\r\nefforts thenceforth made towards the completion of the undertaking.\r\nShortly after the erection of the first column, Messrs. Owen Jones and\r\nDigby Wyatt were charged with a mission to the Continent, in order to\r\nprocure examples of the principal works of art in Europe. They were\r\nfortified by Lord Malmesbury, then Secretary of State, with letters to\r\nthe several ambassadors on their route, expressing the sympathy of the\r\nGovernment in the object of their travels, and backed by the liberal\r\npurse of the Company, who required, for themselves, only that the\r\ncollection should prove worthy of the nation for which they were\r\ncaterers.\r\n\r\nThe travellers first of all visited Paris, and received the most cordial\r\nco-operation of the Government, and of the authorities at the Museum of\r\nthe Louvre, and the Ecole des Beaux Arts. The permission to obtain casts\r\nof any objects which could with safety be taken was at once accorded\r\nthem. From Paris they proceeded to Italy, and thence to Germany, in both\r\nwhich countries they experienced, generally, a ready and generous\r\ncompliance with their wishes. At Munich they received especial\r\nattention, and were most kindly assisted by the British Ambassador, and\r\nthe architect Baron von Klenze, through whose instrumentality and\r\ninfluence King Louis permitted casts of the most choice objects in the\r\nGlyptothek for the first time to be taken.\r\n\r\nThe chief exceptions to the general courtesy were at Rome, Padua, and\r\nVienna. At the first-named city every arrangement had been made for\r\nprocuring casts of the great Obelisk of the Lateran, the celebrated\r\nantique equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius on the Capitol, the\r\nbeautiful monuments by Andrea Sansovino in the Church of S. M. del\r\nPopolo, the interesting bas-reliefs from the Arch of Titus, and other\r\nworks, when an order from the Papal Government forbade the copies to be\r\ntaken: and, accordingly, for the present, our collection, as regards\r\nthese valuable subjects, is incomplete.\r\n\r\nAt Padua contracts had been made for procuring that masterpiece of\r\nRenaissance art, the candelabrum of Riccio, the entire series of bronzes\r\nby Donatello, and several other important works in the Church of St.\r\nAnthony; but, in spite of numerous appeals, aided by the influence of\r\nCardinal Wiseman, the capitular authorities refused their consent.\r\n\r\nAt Vienna agreements had been entered into for procuring a most\r\nimportant series of monuments from the Church of St Stephen, in that\r\ncity; including the celebrated stone pulpit, and the monument of\r\nFrederic III. A contract had also been made for obtaining a cast of the\r\ngrand bronze statue of Victory, at Brescia; but although the influence\r\nof Lord Malmesbury and Lord Westmoreland (our ambassador at Vienna) was\r\nmost actively exerted, permission was absolutely refused by the Austrian\r\nauthorities in Lombardy, as well as in Vienna itself. Thus much it is\r\nnecessary to state in order to justify the Directors of the Crystal\r\nPalace in the eyes of the world for omissions in their collection which\r\nhitherto they have not had power to make good. They are not without\r\nhope, however, that the mere announcement of these deficiencies will be\r\nsufficient to induce the several Governments to take a kindly view of\r\nthe requests that have been made to them, and to participate in the\r\nsatisfaction that follows every endeavour to advance human enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIn England, wherever application has been made, permission--with one\r\nexception--has been immediately granted by the authorities, whether\r\necclesiastical or civil, to take casts of any monuments required. The\r\none interesting exception deserves a special record. The churchwardens\r\nof Beverley Minster, Yorkshire, enjoy the privilege of being able to\r\nrefuse a cast of the celebrated Percy Shrine, the most complete example\r\nof purely English art in our country; and in spite of the protestations\r\nof the Archbishop of York, the Duke of Northumberland, Archdeacon\r\nWilberforce, Sir Charles Barry and others, half the churchwardens in\r\nquestion insist, to this hour, upon their right to have their enjoyment\r\nwithout molestation. The visitors to the Crystal Palace cannot\r\ntherefore, as yet, see the Percy Shrine.\r\n\r\nWhilst Messrs. Jones and Wyatt were busy abroad, the authorities were no\r\nless occupied at home. Sir Joseph Paxton commenced operations by\r\nsecuring for the Company the extensive and celebrated collection of\r\npalms and other plants, brought together with the labour of a century,\r\nby Messrs. Loddiges, of Hackney. The valuable assistance of Mr.\r\nFergusson and Mr. Layard, M.P., was obtained for the erection of a Court\r\nto illustrate the architecture of the long-buried buildings of Assyria;\r\nand a large space in the Gardens was devoted to illustrating the Geology\r\nof the antediluvian period, and exhibiting specimens of the gigantic\r\nanimals living before the flood.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the glass structure was sufficiently advanced, the valuable\r\nproductions of art which Messrs. Jones and Wyatt had acquired abroad\r\nrapidly arrived, and being received into the building, the erection of\r\nthe Fine Art Courts commenced. To carry out these works, artisans of\r\nalmost every continental nation, together with workmen of our own\r\ncountry, were employed; and it is worthy of note, that although, but a\r\nfew years before, many of the nations to which these men belonged were\r\nengaged in deadly warfare against each other, and some of them opposed\r\nto our own country, yet, in the Crystal Palace, these workmen laboured\r\nfor months, side by side, with the utmost good feeling, and without the\r\nleast display of national jealousy.\r\n\r\nTo the whole of these workmen, foreigners and English, engaged in the\r\nCrystal Palace, the Directors are anxious to express their obligations\r\nand sincere acknowledgments. They recognise the value of their labours,\r\nand are fully aware that, if to the minds of a Few the public are\r\nindebted for the conception of the grand Idea now happily realised, to\r\nthe Many we owe its practical existence. Throughout the long and arduous\r\ntoil, they exhibited--allowance being made for some slight and perhaps\r\nunavoidable differences--an amount of zeal, steadiness, and intelligence\r\nwhich does honour to them, and to the several nations which they\r\nrepresent. To all--their due! If the creations of the mind stand\r\nparamount in our estimation, let appropriate honour be rendered to the\r\nskill of hand and eye, which alone can give vitality and form to our\r\nnoblest conceptions. Of the advantages attendant on the erection of the\r\nCrystal Palace, even before the public were admitted to view its\r\ncontents, none was more striking than the education it afforded to those\r\nwho took part in its production. For the first time in England, hundreds\r\nof men received practical instruction--in a national Fine Art\r\nSchool--from which society must derive a lasting benefit. It is not too\r\nmuch to hope that each man will act as a missionary of art and\r\nornamental industry, in whatever quarter his improved faculties may\r\nhereafter be required.\r\n\r\nAt one time during the progress of the works as many as 6,400 men were\r\nengaged in carrying out the designs of the Directors. Besides the\r\nlabours already mentioned, Mr. B. Waterhouse Hawkins, in due time, took\r\npossession of a building in the grounds, and was soon busily employed,\r\nunder the eye of Professor Owen, in the reproduction of those animal\r\ncreations of a past age, our acquaintance with which has hitherto been\r\nconfined to fossil remains. Dr. Latham was engaged in designing and\r\ngiving instructions for the modelling of figures to illustrate the\r\nEthnological department, whilst Mr. Waterhouse and Mr. Gould, aided by\r\nMr. Thomson, as superintendent, and Mr. Bartlett, as taxidermist, were\r\ncollecting and grouping valuable specimens of birds and animals to\r\nrepresent the science of Zoology. Towards the exhibition of the articles\r\nof industry, six architects were commissioned to erect special courts\r\nfor the reception of the principal manufactures, and agents were\r\nemployed in various parts of England to receive the applications of\r\nintending exhibitors.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of the operations that for the first few months went\r\nforward in, and in respect of, the Crystal Palace; and, excepting by\r\nthose whose business it was to watch the progress of the works, no\r\nadequate idea can be formed of the busy activity that prevailed within\r\nthe building and without, or of the marvellous manner in which the\r\nvarious parts of the structure seemed to grow under the hands of the\r\nworkmen, until it assumed the exquisite proportions which it now\r\npossesses. It remains to state that, whereas the parent edifice in Hyde\r\nPark rose under the eye and direction of Sir Charles Fox, the present\r\nbuilding was constructed under the superintendence of Sir Charles’s\r\npartner, the late Mr. Henderson, aided throughout his long and arduous\r\nlabours by Mr. Cochrane, his intelligent and indefatigable assistant.\r\nMr. William Earee has been the Company’s Clerk of the Works from the\r\nraising of the first column, and still occupies that position.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty and his Royal Highness the Prince Consort have been, from\r\nthe first, graciously pleased to express their warmest sympathy with the\r\nundertaking, and visited the Palace several times during the progress of\r\nthe works. In honouring the inauguration of the Palace with her royal\r\npresence, her Majesty gave the best proof of the interest she takes in\r\nan institution which--like the great structure originated by her Royal\r\nConsort--has for its chief object the advancement of civilisation and\r\nthe welfare of her subjects.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] The Queen’s apartments in the Crystal Palace, destined for the\r\n  reception of her Majesty and his Royal Highness the Prince Consort,\r\n  when they honour the Exhibition with their presence, have been erected\r\n  by Messrs. J. G. Crace and Co., in the Italian style. This beautiful\r\n  suite of apartments, which are placed at the north end of the\r\n  building, consists of a large entrance vestibule with architectural\r\n  ornaments, and painted arabesque decorations. A long corridor leads\r\n  from the vestibule to the several apartments, and is formed into an\r\n  arched passage by means of circular-headed doorways, before which hang\r\n  _portières_, or curtains. To the right of the entrance are two rooms,\r\n  one appropriated to the ladies-in-waiting, and the other to the\r\n  equerries; the walls of both being divided into panels, and decorated\r\n  in the Italian style. On the left are the apartments for the use of\r\n  her Majesty and the Prince Consort, consisting of a drawing-room and\r\n  two retiring rooms. The walls of the drawing-room are divided by\r\n  pilasters, the panels covered with green silk. The cove of the ceiling\r\n  is decorated with arabesque ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE BUILDING.\r\n\r\nIn taking the structure of the Great Exhibition of 1851--that type of a\r\nclass of architecture which may fairly be called “Modern English”[4]--as\r\nthe model for the new building at Sydenham, the projectors found it\r\nnecessary to make such modifications and improvements as were suggested\r\nby the difference between a temporary receiving-house for the world’s\r\nindustrial wealth, and a permanent Palace of Art and Education, intended\r\nfor the use of mankind long after its original founders should have\r\npassed away. Not only, however, have increased strength and durability\r\nbeen considered, but beauty and artistic effect have come in for a due\r\nshare of attention. The difference of general aspect between the present\r\nPalace and its predecessor is visible at a glance. In the parent\r\nedifice, the external appearance, although grand, was monotonous; the\r\nlong flat roof was broken by only one transept, and the want of an\r\nelevation proportionate to the great length of the building was\r\ncertainly displeasing. In the Sydenham Palace, an arched roof covers the\r\nnave--raising it forty-four feet higher than the nave in Hyde Park--and\r\nthree transepts are introduced into the structure instead of one, the\r\ncentral transept towering into the air, and forming a hall to the Palace\r\nof surpassing brilliancy and lightness. A further improvement is the\r\nformation of recesses, twenty-four feet deep, in the garden fronts of\r\nall the transepts. These throw fine shadows, and take away from the\r\ncontinuous surface of plain glass walls: whilst the whole general\r\narrangement of the exterior--the roofs of the side aisles rising\r\nstep-like to the circular roof of the nave,--the interposition of low\r\nsquare towers at the junction of the nave and transepts,--the open\r\ngalleries towards the garden front, the long wings stretching forth on\r\neither side--produce a play of light and shade, and break the building\r\ninto parts, which, without in any way detracting from the grandeur and\r\nsimplicity of the whole construction, or causing the parts themselves to\r\nappear mean or small, present a variety of surface that charms and fully\r\nsatisfies the eye.\r\n\r\n  [4] We do not know any name more suitable to express the character of\r\n  this iron and glass building than that which we have chosen. In Gothic\r\n  architecture we have named one style “Early English,” and we think we\r\n  may with equal propriety confer the title of “Modern English” upon the\r\n  new order, which is essentially the creation of the nineteenth\r\n  century, and which served to house one of the greatest national\r\n  displays that England ever attempted--THE GREAT EXHIBITION OF 1851.\r\n  The erection of the building both of 1851 and of 1854, it may be well\r\n  to remark, is mainly due to the rapid advances made in this country in\r\n  the manufactures of glass and iron, substances which with only\r\n  moderate attention will defy the effects of time. The present\r\n  structure is capable of enduring longer than the oldest marble or\r\n  stone architectural monuments of antiquity. The iron, which forms its\r\n  skeleton or framework, becomes, when painted, the most indestructible\r\n  of materials, and the entire covering of glass may be renewed again\r\n  and again without in any way interfering with the construction which\r\n  it covers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPEN GALLERY TOWARDS THE GARDEN FRONT.]\r\n\r\nUnity in architecture is one of the most requisite and agreeable of its\r\nqualities: and certainly no building possesses it in a greater degree\r\nthan the Crystal Palace. Its design is most simple: one portion\r\ncorresponds with another; there is no introduction of needless ornament:\r\na simplicity of treatment reigns throughout. Nor is this unity confined\r\nto the building. It characterises the contents of the glass structure,\r\nand prevails in the grounds. All the component parts of the Exhibition\r\nblend, yet all are distinct: and the effect of the admirable and\r\nharmonious arrangement is, that all confusion in the vast establishment,\r\nwithin and without, is avoided. “The mighty maze” has not only its plan,\r\nbut a plan of the most lucid and instructive kind, and the visitor is\r\nenabled to examine every court, whether artistic or industrial; every\r\nobject, whether of nature or of art, in regular order; so that, as in a\r\nwell-arranged book, he may proceed from subject to subject at his\r\ndiscretion, and derive useful information without the trouble and\r\nvexation of working his way through a labyrinth.\r\n\r\nAll the materials employed in the Exhibition of 1851, with the exception\r\nof the glass on the whole roof, and the framing of the transept-roof,\r\nhave been used in the construction of the Crystal Palace. The general\r\nprinciple of construction, therefore, is identical in the two buildings.\r\nThe modifications that have taken place, and the reasons that have led\r\nto them, have already been stated. Two difficulties, however, which were\r\nunknown in Hyde Park, had to be provided against at Sydenham: viz., the\r\nloose nature of the soil, and the sloping character of the ground. Means\r\nwere taken to overcome these difficulties at the very outset of the\r\nwork. The disadvantage of soil was repaired by the introduction of\r\nmasses of concrete and brickwork under each column, in order to secure\r\nbreadth of base and stability of structure. The slanting ground was\r\nseized by Sir Joseph Paxton with his usual sagacity, in order to be\r\nconverted from an obstacle into a positive advantage. The ground ran\r\nrapidly down towards the garden, and Sir Joseph accordingly constructed\r\na lower or basement story towards the garden front, by means of which\r\nnot only increased space was gained, but a higher elevation secured to\r\nthe whole building, and the noblest possible view. The lower story is\r\nsufficiently large to serve as a department for the exhibition of\r\nMachinery in Motion, and a very interesting exhibition of Agricultural\r\nImplements, which important branches of science and human industry will\r\nthus be contemplated apart from other objects. Behind this space,\r\ntowards the interior of the building, is a capacious horizontal brick\r\nshaft, twenty-four feet wide, extending the whole length of the\r\nbuilding, and denominated “Sir Joseph Paxton’s Tunnel” (A). Leading out\r\nof this tunnel are the furnaces and boilers connected with the heating\r\napparatus, together with brick recesses for the stowage of coke. The\r\ntunnel itself is connected with the railway, and is used as a roadway\r\nfor bringing into, and taking from, the Palace all objects of art and of\r\nindustry; an arrangement that leaves the main floor of the building\r\nindependent of all such operations. Behind the tunnel, and towards the\r\nwest, the declivity of the ground is met by means of brick piers of the\r\nheights necessary to raise the foundation pieces of the columns to the\r\nlevel at which they rest on the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe building consists, above the basement floor, of a grand central\r\nnave, two side aisles, two main galleries, three transepts, and two\r\nwings. It will be remembered, that in Hyde Park an imposing effect was\r\nsecured by the mere repetition of a column and a girder, which, although\r\nstriking and simple, was certainly monotonous; and, moreover, in\r\nconsequence of the great length of the building, the columns and girders\r\nsucceeded one another so rapidly that the eye had no means of measuring\r\nthe actual length. At Sydenham, pairs of columns and girders are\r\nadvanced eight feet into the nave at every seventy-two feet, thus\r\nbreaking the uniform straight line, and enabling the eye to measure and\r\nappreciate the distance.\r\n\r\nThe building above the level of the floor is entirely of iron and glass,\r\nwith the exception of a portion at the west front, which is panelled\r\nwith wood. The whole length of the main building is 1,608 feet, and the\r\nwings 574 feet each, making a length of 2,756 feet, which with the 720\r\nfeet in the colonnade, leading from the railway station to the wings,\r\ngives a total length of 3,476 feet; or nearly three-quarters of a mile\r\nof ground covered with a transparent roof of glass.\r\n\r\nVisitors are fond of reverting to the old building in Hyde Park, and of\r\ncomparing it with the present structure; in order to help the\r\ncomparison, we furnish, side by side, the exact measurements of the two\r\nbuildings; from which it will be seen that either building exceeds the\r\nother, in some of its proportions.\r\n\r\n     CRYSTAL PALACE AT SYDENHAM.

These joists are carried on sleepers and props eight feet apart.\r\nThe girders which support the galleries and the roof-work, and carry the\r\nbrick arches over the basement-floor, are of cast-iron, and are 24 feet\r\nin length. The connections between the girders and columns are applied\r\nin the same manner as in the building of 1851. The principle of\r\nconnection was originally condemned by some men of standing in the\r\nscientific world; but experience has proved it to be sound and admirable\r\nin every respect. The mode of connection is not merely that of resting\r\nthe girders on the columns in order to support the roofs and galleries,\r\nbut the top and bottom of each girder are firmly secured to each of the\r\ncolumns, so that the girder preserves the perpendicularity of the\r\ncolumn, and secures lateral stiffness to the entire edifice. Throughout\r\nthe building the visitor will notice, at certain intervals, diagonally\r\nplaced, rods connected at the crossing, and uniting column with column.\r\nThese are the diagonal bracings, or the rods provided to resist the\r\naction of the wind: they are strong enough to resist any strain that can\r\nbe brought to bear against them, and are fitted with screwed connections\r\nand couplings, so that they can be adjusted with the greatest accuracy.\r\nThe roof, from end to end, is on the Paxton ridge-and-furrow system, and\r\nthe glass employed in the roof is ¹⁄₁₃ of an inch in thickness (21 oz.\r\nper foot). The discharge of the rain-water is effected by gutters, from\r\nwhich the water is conveyed down the inside of the columns, at the base\r\nof which are the necessary outlets leading to the main drains of the\r\nbuilding. The first gallery is gained from the ground-floor by means of\r\nflights of stairs about 23 feet high; eight such flights being\r\ndistributed over the building. This gallery is 24 feet wide, and devoted\r\nto the exhibition of articles of industry. The upper gallery is 8 feet\r\nwide, extending, like the other, round the building; it is gained from\r\nthe lower gallery, by spiral staircases, of which there are eight. The\r\ngreater number of these staircases are divided into two flights, each\r\nflight being 20 feet high; but in the centre transept the two staircases\r\ncontain four flights of the same altitude. Round this upper gallery, at\r\nthe very summit of the nave and transepts, as well as round the\r\nground-floor of the building, are placed louvres, or ventilators, made\r\nof galvanised iron. By the opening or closing of these louvres--a\r\nservice readily performed--the temperature of the Crystal Palace is so\r\nregulated that on the hottest day of summer, the dry parching heat\r\nmounts to the roof to be dismissed, whilst a pure and invigorating\r\nsupply is introduced at the floor in its place, giving new life to the\r\nthirsty plant and fresh vigour to man. The coolness thus obtained within\r\nthe Palace will be sought in vain on such a summer’s day outside the\r\nedifice.\r\n\r\nThe total length of columns employed in the construction of the main\r\nbuildings and wings would extend, if laid in a straight line, to a\r\ndistance of sixteen miles and a quarter. The total weight of iron used\r\nin the main building and wings amounts to 9,641 tons, 17 cwt., 1\r\nquarter. The superficial quantity of glass used is 25 acres; and weighs\r\n500 tons; if the panes were laid side by side, they would extend to a\r\ndistance of 48 miles; if end to end, to the almost incredible length of\r\n242 miles. To complete our statistics, we have further to add that the\r\nquantity of bolts and rivets distributed over the main structure and\r\nwings weighs 175 tons, 1 cwt., 1 quarter; that the nails hammered into\r\nthe Palace increase its weight by 103 tons, 6 cwt., and that the amount\r\nof brick-work in the main building and wings is 15,391 cubic yards.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the south wing to the Crystal Palace Railway station, as\r\nabove indicated, is a colonnade 720 feet long, 17 feet wide, and 18 feet\r\nhigh. It possesses a superficial area of 15,500 feet, and the quantity\r\nof iron employed in this covered passage is 60 tons; of glass 30,000\r\nsuperficial feet.\r\n\r\nBut vast as are the proportions of the Crystal Palace, novel and\r\nscientific as is the principle of construction, we are in some degree\r\nprepared for this magnificent result of intellect and industry by the\r\nGreat Exhibition of 1851. One arrangement, however, in the present\r\nstructure admits of no comparison; for, in point of extent, it leaves\r\nall former efforts in the same direction far behind, and stands by\r\nitself unrivalled. We refer to the process of warming the atmosphere in\r\nthe enormous Glass Palace to the mild and genial heat of Madeira,\r\nthroughout our cold and damp English winter.\r\n\r\nThe employment of hot water as a medium for heating apartments seems to\r\nhave been first hinted at in the year 1594, by Sir Hugh Platt, who, in a\r\nwork entitled “The Jewel House of Art and Nature,” published in that\r\nyear, suggests the use of hot water as a safe means of drying gunpowder,\r\nand likewise recommends it for heating a plant-house. In 1716, Sir\r\nMartin Triewald, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, proposed a scheme for heating a\r\ngreen-house by hot water; and a Frenchman, M. Bonnemain, a short time\r\nafterwards invented an apparatus for hatching chickens by the same\r\nmeans. In the early part of this century Sir Martin Triewald’s plan of\r\nheating was applied to conservatories, at St. Petersburgh; and a few\r\nyears later, Bonnemain’s arrangement was introduced into England, where\r\nit has undergone several improvements, and occupied the attention of\r\nscientific men. The application of hot water to the heating of churches,\r\npublic libraries, and other buildings, has been attended with\r\nconsiderable success, and it is now looked upon as the safest, as well\r\nas one of the most effectual artificial methods of heating.\r\n\r\nThe simple plan of heating by hot water is that which Sir Joseph Paxton\r\nhas adopted for the Crystal Palace. But simple as the method undoubtedly\r\nis, its adaptation to the purposes of the Palace has cost infinite\r\nlabour and anxious consideration: for hitherto it has remained an\r\nunsolved problem how far, and in what quantity, water could be made to\r\ntravel through pipes--flowing and returning by means of the propulsion\r\nof heat from the boilers. At Chatsworth, the seat of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, the principle has been carried out on a large scale, and the\r\nexperiment there tried has yielded data and proof: but in the present\r\nbuilding, a greater extent of piping has been attached to the boilers\r\nthan was ever before known, or even contemplated. In order to give the\r\nvisitor some idea of the magnitude of the operation in question, it will\r\nbe sufficient to state that the pipes for the conveyance of the hot\r\nwater, laid under the floor of the main building, and around the wings,\r\nwould, if placed in a straight line, and taken at an average\r\ncircumference of 12 inches, stretch to a distance of more than 50 miles,\r\nand that the water in flowing from and returning to the boilers, travels\r\none mile and three-quarters. But even with these extraordinary results\r\nobtained, the question as to the distance to which water can be\r\npropelled by means of heat is far from being definitely settled. Indeed,\r\nSir Joseph Paxton and Mr. Henderson invented an ingenious contrivance,\r\nby means of which, should it ever be required, a much larger heating\r\nsurface may be called forth at any time in any particular portion of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the Heating Apparatus may be described as\r\nfollows:--Nearly twenty-four feet below the surface of the flooring of\r\nthe main building, and leading out of “Sir Joseph Paxton’s Tunnel” (the\r\nname given to the roadway in the basement story, extending the whole\r\nlength of the building on the side nearest the Gardens), are placed, at\r\ncertain intervals, boiler-houses, each containing two boilers capable of\r\nholding 11,000 gallons of water. The boilers are twenty-two in number,\r\nand are set in pairs. In addition to these, a boiler is placed at the\r\nnorth end of the building, on account of the increased heat there\r\nrequired for the tropical plants. There are also two boilers set in the\r\nlower stories of each wing, and two small boilers are appropriated to\r\nthe water in the fountain basins at each end of the building, which\r\ncontain Victoria Regias and other aquatic plants of tropical climes.\r\nFour pipes are immediately connected with each boiler; two of such pipes\r\nconvey the water from the boiler, and the other two bring it back; they\r\nare called the main pipes, and are nine inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nOf the two pipes that convey the water from the boiler, one crosses the\r\nbuilding transversely--from the garden-front to the opposite side.\r\nConnected with this pipe, at certain distances, and in allotted numbers,\r\nare smaller pipes, five inches in diameter, laid horizontally, and\r\nimmediately beneath the flooring of the building. These convey the\r\nwater from the main pipe to certain required distances, and then bring\r\nit back to the _return_ main pipe, through which it flows into the\r\nboiler. The second main pipe conveys the water for heating the front of\r\nthe building next to the Garden; and connected with this, as with the\r\nother main pipe, are smaller pipes through which the water ramifies, and\r\nthen, in like manner, is returned to the boiler. Thus, then, by the mere\r\npropulsion of heat, a vast quantity of water is kept in constant motion\r\nthroughout the Palace, continually flowing and returning, and giving out\r\nwarmth that makes its way upwards, and disseminates a genial atmosphere\r\nin every part.\r\n\r\nTo ensure pure circulation throughout the winter, ventilators have been\r\nintroduced direct from the main building into each furnace, where the\r\nair, so brought, being consumed by the fire, the atmosphere in the\r\nPalace is continually renewed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REFERENCES\r\n\r\n    A Egyptian Court\r\n    B Greek Court\r\n    C Roman Court\r\n    D Alhambra Court\r\n    E Assyrian Court\r\n    F Byzantine Court\r\n    G German Mediæval Court\r\n    H English Mediæval Court\r\n    I French Mediæval Court\r\n    J Renaissance Court\r\n    K Elizabethan Court\r\n    L Italian Court\r\n    M Italian Vestibule\r\n    N Cort of Monuments of Art\r\n    O Stationery Court\r\n    P Birmingham Court\r\n    Q Sheffield Court\r\n    R Pompeian Court\r\n    S Natural History\r\n    T Natural History\r\n    U Foreign Glass Manufactures\r\n    V British Ceramic Manufactures\r\n    W Ceramic Court\r\n    X Fancy Manufactures\r\n    Y Concert Room\r\n    Z Screen of the Kings and Queens of England\r\n  A A South Transept\r\n  B B Great Central Transept\r\n  C C North Transept Tropical Division\r\n  D D Great Organ and Orchestra d d Concert Orchestra\r\n  E E Saloon for Dining\r\n  F F Dining Room\r\n  f f Kitchens and Covered Way\r\n  G G South Wing Dining Saloon\r\n  H H The Terrace Dining Room\r\n  J J Mammoth Tree\r\n  K K The Great Water Towers\r\n  L L The Library Reading Room\r\n  M M Colossal Egyptian Figures\r\n  N N Lecture Room\r\n\r\n  _N.B.

Passing\r\n  through the nearest section of the Natural History Illustrations, he\r\n  proceeds direct to the front of the _Screen of the Kings and Queens of\r\n  England_, from whence he walks up the Nave to the _Great Central\r\n  Transept_, and then commences the series of _Fine Arts Courts_ with\r\n  the _Egyptian Court_, continuing it with the _Greek Court_, the _Roman\r\n  Court_, and, through the division for the Tropical End, the _Alhambra\r\n  Court_, and the _Assyrian Court_. Then crossing this end of the\r\n  building, he continues the series of Courts on the other side with the\r\n  _Byzantine Court_, the _German Mediæval Court_, the _English Mediæval\r\n  Court_, the _French and Italian Mediæval Court_, the _Renaissance\r\n  Court_, the _Elizabethan Court_, the _Italian Court_, and the _Italian\r\n  Vestibule_. The _Court of Monuments of Art_ is next, from which the\r\n  visitor crosses the Central Transept to the west, and explores the\r\n  _Stationery Court_ and the adjacent departments, then the _Birmingham\r\n  Court_, the _Sheffield Court_, and the _Pompeian House_, from which he\r\n  crosses the South Transept, and enters the _Natural History\r\n  Department_, having inspected which, he returns up the building on the\r\n  other side, through the _Foreign Glass Manufactures Court_, the\r\n  _British Porcelain Manufactures Court_, the _Ceramic Court_, and the\r\n  _Court of Fancy Manufactures_. Returning then to the Screen of the\r\n  Kings and Queens of England, the visitor examines the collections of\r\n  the _Nave_, the _South Transept_, the _Great Central Transept_, the\r\n  _North Transept_, and the _Tropical End of the Building_. The _Botany\r\n  of the Palace_ is then described. The _Main and Upper Galleries_, in\r\n  which will be found the _Picture Gallery_, the _Naval Museum_, the\r\n  _Engineering Models_, the _Indian Court_, the _Industrial Museum and\r\n  Technological Collection_, and the _Industrial Exhibition_ (described\r\n  in the Exhibitors’ Descriptive Catalogue, page 175), should be next\r\n  visited; and, after them, the _Agricultural Machinery_, and the\r\n  _Machinery in Motion_, which are exhibited in the basement story next\r\n  the Gardens: the basement is reached by descending the stairs from\r\n  either of the Transepts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRYSTAL PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENTRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe Crystal Palace Railway from London Bridge, and the West End Railway\r\nfrom Pimlico, unite at the Station, in the grounds of the Crystal\r\nPalace. The Station is connected with the South Wing of the building by\r\na glass-covered colonnade, along which is planted a brilliant array of\r\nflowering plants, whilst luxuriant creeping plants adorn the wall. The\r\nFine Art Courts commence with the Egyptian Court, at the Central\r\nTransept, from whence the sequence is continued round the northern\r\nportion of the Nave. The Central Transept then will be the proper\r\nstarting-point. When the weather is fine, the visitor may cross the\r\ngardens from the Railway Station direct to the central entrance on the\r\nupper terrace. We assume that he proceeds by the more usual way of the\r\nColonnade, through the South Wing, until he attains the floor of the\r\nmain building. He then passes through the Natural History illustrations\r\nwhich are nearest, and which he will examine hereafter; and, keeping to\r\nthis, the south end of the Palace, proceeds towards the centre of the\r\nNave, taking his stand opposite the Screen of the Kings and Queens of\r\nEngland, which bounds the long Nave at this end. From this point an\r\nunrivalled general view is obtained of the interior of the building. In\r\nthe foreground is the Crystal Fountain, which adorned the Palace in Hyde\r\nPark, but here elevated in its proportions and improved. It is\r\nsurrounded by a sheet of water, at each end of which float the gigantic\r\nleaves of the _Victoria Regia_, the intermediate space being occupied by\r\nvarious aquatic plants,--the _Nymphæa Devoniensis_, the _Nymphæa\r\ncærulea_, the _Nymphæa dentata_, and the _Nelumbium speciosum_, or\r\nsacred bean of the Pythagoreans, being conspicuous, with many others,\r\nbeautiful, rare, or curious. The basin is also encircled with rich\r\nflowers. On either side of the Nave the plants of almost every clime\r\nwave their foliage, forming a mass of cool, pleasant colour, admirably\r\nharmonising with the surrounding tints, and also acting as a most\r\neffective background to relieve the white statues, which are\r\npicturesquely grouped along the Nave; at the back of these are the\r\nfaçades of the various Industrial and Fine Art Courts, whose bright\r\ncolouring gives additional brilliancy to the interior, whilst the aërial\r\nblue tint of the arched roof above considerably increases the effect of\r\nthe whole composition, having the effect of an opal vault. Towards\r\nevening the interior of the Palace appears like a vocal grove, the\r\nvisitor hearing with delight the beautiful note of the nightingale,\r\ntogether with that of blackbirds, thrushes, wrens, and robin-redbreasts,\r\nwhich build and make a perpetual home of this magnificent covered\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF PALACE FROM SECOND TERRACE.]\r\n\r\nLet the visitor now proceed up the building until he arrives at the\r\nCentral Transept, at which point he will be enabled to judge of the\r\nvastness of the hall in the midst of which he stands, and of the whole\r\nstructure of which the transept forms so noble and conspicuous a part.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO THE FINE ARTS COURTS.\r\n\r\nIn order the better to appreciate the arrangement of those restorations\r\nthrough which we now propose to conduct the visitor, a few words\r\nexplanatory of the object which they are intended to serve may prove of\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important objects of the Crystal Palace is to teach a\r\ngreat practical lesson in Art. Specimens of the various phases through\r\nwhich the arts of Architecture and Sculpture have passed, are here\r\ncollected, commencing from the earliest known period down to modern\r\ntimes, or from the remote ages of Egyptian civilisation to the sixteenth\r\ncentury after Christ--a period of more than three thousand years.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no subject, with the exception of the literature of departed\r\nnations, affords more interest to the mind of man, than these visible\r\nproofs of the different states of society throughout the world’s\r\nhistory; and nothing better aids us in realising the people and customs\r\nof the past, than the wonderful monuments happily preserved from the\r\ndestructive hand of Time, and now restored to something of their\r\noriginal splendour by the patient and laborious researches of modern\r\ntimes; and, we may add (not without some pride), by the enterprising\r\nliberality of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nNor is it the least extraordinary fact, in this view of progress, that\r\nthe building itself, which contains these valuable monuments of past\r\nages, is essentially different from every preceding style, uniting\r\nperfect strength with aërial lightness, and as easy of erection as it is\r\ncapable of endurance. Thus then, beneath one roof, may the visitor trace\r\nthe course of art from centuries long anterior to Christianity, down to\r\nthe very moment in which he lives, and obtain by this means an idea of\r\nthe successive states of civilisation which from time to time have\r\narisen in the world, flourishing for a greater or less period, until\r\noverturned by the aggressions of barbarians, or the no less destructive\r\nagency of a sensual and degraded luxury. Sculpture, the sister art of\r\narchitecture, has also been worthily illustrated. Vainly, in any part of\r\nthe world, will be sought a similar collection, by means of which the\r\nprogress of that beautiful art can be regularly traced.\r\n\r\nThe statues will generally be found as much as possible in or near the\r\nArchitectural Courts of the periods and countries to which they belong,\r\nso that the eye may track the intellectual stream as it flows on, now\r\nrising to the highest point of beauty, and now sinking to the lowest\r\ndepths of degradation. The visitor is invited to proceed with us on this\r\nworld-wide tour of inspection, but he must bear in mind that our present\r\ntask is to show him how to examine the Building itself, with its\r\ncontents, and not to describe them, except by briefly pointing out the\r\nmost remarkable objects that encounter him on his way. For detailed and\r\nvaluable information the visitor is referred to the excellent Handbooks\r\nof the respective Courts, all of which describe with minuteness not only\r\ntheir contents, but every needful circumstance in connection with their\r\nhistory. The point from which we start is the Central Transept.\r\nProceeding northwards, up the Nave, the visitor turns immediately to the\r\nleft and finds himself in front of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EGYPTIAN COURT.[5]\r\n\r\nThe remains of Egyptian Architecture are the most ancient yet\r\ndiscovered. They possess an absorbing interest, not only on account of\r\nthe connection of Egypt with Biblical history, but also of the perfect\r\nstate of the remains, which enables us to judge of the high state of\r\ncivilisation to which Egypt attained, and which have permitted the\r\ndecipherers of the hieroglyphics, led by Dr. Young, Champollion, and\r\nSir Gardner Wilkinson, in our own time, to give us clear insight into\r\nthe manner of life--public and private--of this early and interesting\r\nnation. Egyptian architecture is characterised by simplicity of\r\nconstruction, gigantic proportions, and massive solidity. The buildings\r\nwere almost entirely of stone, and many of them excavations and shapings\r\nof rocks. The examples of this architecture now before us are not taken\r\nfrom any one ruin, but are illustrations of various styles, commencing\r\nwith the earliest, and terminating with the latest, so that we are\r\nenabled to follow the gradual development of the art. Little change,\r\nhowever, was effected during its progress. The original solidity so\r\nadmirably suited to the requirements of the Egyptians continued to the\r\nend; and religion forbade a change in the conventional representations\r\nof those gods and kings which so extensively cover the temples and\r\ntombs. So that we find the same peculiar character continued in a great\r\nmeasure to the very last.\r\n\r\n  [5] See the “Handbook to the Egyptian Court,” by Owen Jones and Samuel\r\n  Sharpe; also, “The Egyptians in the Time of the Pharaohs, being a\r\n  Companion to the Crystal Palace Collection,” by Sir Gardner Wilkinson,\r\n  to which is added, “An Introduction to the Study of Egyptian\r\n  Hieroglyphs,” by Samuel Birch. Crown 8vo., with Illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Egyptian Court.]\r\n\r\nAdvancing up the avenue of lions, cast from a pair brought from Egypt by\r\nLord Prudhoe (the present Duke of Northumberland), we have before us the\r\nouter walls and columns of a temple, not taken from any one particular\r\nstructure, but composed from various sources, to illustrate Egyptian\r\ncolumns and capitals during the Ptolemaic period, somewhere about 300\r\nyears B.C. On the walls are coloured sunk-reliefs showing a king making\r\nofferings or receiving gifts from the gods. The capitals or heads of the\r\ncolumns are palm and lotus-leaved; some showing the papyrus in its\r\nvarious stages of development, from the simple bud to the full-blown\r\nflower. The representation of the palm and the papyrus occurs frequently\r\nin Egyptian architecture; the leaves of the latter, it will be\r\nremembered, were made into a kind of paper, and its flowers were\r\nspecially used as offerings in the temples. We shall afterwards inspect\r\nsome growing specimens of this curious plant in the fountain basin at\r\nthe north end of the Nave, as well as of the lotus, when these\r\nrestorations may be remembered with interest. On the frieze above the\r\ncolumns is a hieroglyphic inscription stating that “in the seventeenth\r\nyear of the reign of Victoria, the ruler of the waves, this Palace was\r\nerected and furnished with a thousand statues, a thousand plants, &c.,\r\nlike as a book for the use of the men of all countries.” This\r\ninscription is repeated, with some slight additions, on the frieze of\r\nthe interior of the Court. On the cornice of both the inside and outside\r\nof the Court, are the names of her Majesty and the Prince Consort,\r\nengraved in hieroglyphic characters, and also winged globes, the\r\nsymbolic protecting deity of doorways. Entering by the central doorway,\r\non the lintels and sides of which are inserted the different titles of\r\nKing Ptolemy, in hieroglyphics, we find ourselves in the exterior court\r\nof a temple in which the multitude assembled; the decorations of the\r\nwalls are similar to those we saw outside, and it must be borne in mind\r\nthat the colouring is taken from actual remains in Egypt. On the wall to\r\nthe left is a large picture copied from the great Temple of Rameses III.\r\nor Rameses Mai Amun, at Medinet Haboo, near Thebes, showing the counting\r\nof the hands of the slain--three thousand as we are informed by the\r\nhieroglyphics engraved over the heads of the scribes--before the king\r\nwho is in his chariot; on the right-hand side of the Court is a\r\nrepresentation of a battle-scene, with the Egyptians storming a\r\nfortress. Turning to the left, after examining the eight gigantic\r\nfigures of Rameses the Great, forming the façade of another temple, we\r\nenter the Court of Amunothph, a colonnade of an early period, its date\r\nbeing about 1300 B.C. The columns represent eight stems and buds of the\r\npapyrus bound together, and are cast from a black granite column bearing\r\nthe name of Amunothph, now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First order of Egyptian Column.]\r\n\r\nPassing on we find ourselves in a dark tomb copied from one at Beni\r\nHassan. It is the earliest piece of architecture in the Crystal Palace,\r\nits date being about 1660 B.C. The original tomb is cut in the solid\r\nchain of rocks that forms a boundary on the east of the Nile, separating\r\nthe sandy desert from the fertile valley of the river. Although\r\narchitectural remains exist in Egypt of a much earlier date than this\r\ntomb, it still possesses great value to us, for it may be considered as\r\nexhibiting the first _order_ of Egyptian columns, which was employed in\r\nconstructing buildings at as remote a period as two thousand years\r\nbefore Christ; this fluted column in another respect claims our\r\nattention, for there can be but little doubt that it supplied the Greeks\r\nwith the model of their early Doric. The original tomb has but one\r\ninstead of four entrances as here represented, and is accordingly more\r\ngloomy and impressive. What is lost in sombre effect, however, is made\r\nup to the visitor in convenience.\r\n\r\nPassing out, we behold, in front of us, a beautiful colonnade, or\r\nportico, from the Island of Philöe, and of the same period as the\r\nEgyptian wall which we first saw fronting the Nave. Within this we\r\ncannot fail to remark the scattered statues, especially the Egyptian\r\nAntinous, executed during the Roman rule, the life-like development of\r\nwhose limbs, representing, as it no doubt does, the Egyptian type, is\r\nsufficient to convince us that when Egyptian art was not tied down by\r\nthe hierarchical yoke, it was capable of producing works of truth and\r\nmerit. Another work of art, executed when the country was under the\r\nGreek yoke, is the remarkable bas-relief portrait of Alexander the\r\nGreat, inscribed in hieroglyphics and Greek characters. The Greek name\r\nis spelt wrongly--a sufficient proof that the work of art is from the\r\nhand of an Egyptian artist. Amidst the statues will be found two\r\ncircular-headed stones--copies of the celebrated Rosetta stone (so\r\ncalled from having been found at the little town of Rosetta, near\r\nAlexandria) from which Dr. Young and Champollion obtained a key to the\r\ndeciphering of hieroglyphics. The stone is engraved in three characters:\r\nHieroglyphic, Enchorial--the writing of the country--and Greek; the\r\ninscription is an address from the priests to the Greek King of Egypt,\r\nPtolemy V., in which the sovereign’s praises are set forth, and orders\r\nare given to set up a statue of the king, together with the address, in\r\nevery temple. The date of this interesting remnant of Egyptian manners\r\nand customs is about 200 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nFurther on to the right, as we face the west--in a recess--is the model\r\nof the Temple of Aboo Simbel, cut in the side of a rock, in Nubia. The\r\nsitting figures which, in the original, are of the size of the gigantic\r\nfigures which we shall afterwards see in the Northern Transept,\r\nrepresent Rameses the Great, and the smaller ones around, his mother,\r\nwife, and daughter. The original tomb is ten times as large as the\r\npresent model. It should be remembered that nearly all the models here\r\nintroduced are very much below the size of the architectural remains\r\nwhich they represent. For example: the majority of the columns in the\r\nTemple of Karnak are 47 feet high, and some are 62 feet. Turning from\r\nthis recess, and after looking at the beautiful lotus columns to the\r\nleft, surmounted by the cow-eared Goddess of Love of the Egyptians, and\r\nhaving examined the two large pictures on the walls of the temple--one\r\nof which represents a king slaying his enemies with the aid of the god\r\nAmmon Ra, and the other a feat of arms of the same king--we direct our\r\nattention to the columns before us, which are reduced models of a\r\nportion of the celebrated Temple of Karnak at Thebes. This temple was,\r\nperhaps, one of the largest and most interesting in Egypt; the principal\r\nportions are said to have been erected by Rameses II. about 1170 B.C. It\r\nseems to have been a fashion with the Theban kings to make additions to\r\nthis temple during their respective reigns; and, as each monarch was\r\nanxious to outvie his predecessor, the size of the fabric threatened to\r\nbecome unbounded. Temples and tombs were the grand extravagances of the\r\nEgyptian kings. The sums that modern rulers devote to palaces which add\r\nto their splendour whilst living, were given by the remote princes of\r\nwhom we speak, and who regarded life as only a fleet passage towards\r\neternity, for the construction of enduring homes when life should have\r\npassed away. Inasmuch as, if the career of an Egyptian king proved\r\nirreligious or oppressive, the priests and people could deny him\r\nsepulture in his own tomb, it is not unlikely that many Egyptian kings\r\nlavished large sums upon temples, in order to conciliate the priestly\r\nfavour, and to secure for their embalmed bodies the much-prized\r\nsanctuary. It is to be observed, however, with respect to the names and\r\ninscriptions found on Egyptian monuments, that they are by no means\r\nalways to be taken as an authentic account of the remains within. Some\r\nof the Egyptian kings have been proved guilty of erasing from tombs the\r\nnames of their predecessors, and of substituting their own; an\r\nunwarrantable and startling deception that has proved very awkward and\r\nembarrassing to Egyptian antiquaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Column from Karnak.]\r\n\r\nThe portion of Karnak here modelled is taken from the Hall of Columns,\r\ncommenced by Osirei the First, and completed by his son, Rameses the\r\nGreat, a most illustrious monarch, whose deeds are frequently recorded,\r\nand whose statue is found in many parts of Egypt, and who flourished\r\nduring the twelfth century before Christ. Before entering the temple, we\r\nstay to notice the representations of animals and birds on the frieze\r\nabove the columns, which is the dedication of the temple to the gods.\r\nEntering between the columns, on the lower part of which is the name of\r\nRameses the Great, and, in the middle, a representation of the three\r\nprincipal divinities of Thebes receiving offerings from King Osirei;\r\nand, after thoroughly examining this interesting restoration, we return\r\nagain into the outer court. The visitor who wishes to realise to himself\r\nthe actual condition of the principal Egyptian temples and\r\nwall-sculptures of Karnak and Kalabshee, can do so by inspecting the\r\nsplendid collection of French photographs of these ancient works of art\r\nin the Gallery immediately over this court, or by consulting the works\r\nof Champollion and Sir Gardner Wilkinson in the Reading Room of the\r\nLibrary. Regaining the Nave, a few steps, directed to the left, bring us\r\nto\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF BENI HASSAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK COURT.[6]\r\n\r\nArchitecture and sculpture have here made a stride. We have noted even\r\nin Egypt the advance from early rude effort to a consistent gigantic\r\nsystem of art, which grew under the shadow of a stern hierarchical\r\nreligion. We step at once from the gloom into the sunshine of Greek art.\r\nThe overwhelming grandeur of Egypt, with its austere conventionalities,\r\nis exchanged for true simplicity, great beauty, and ideality. Just\r\nproportions, truth, grace of form, and appropriate ornament,\r\ncharacterised Greek architecture. The fundamental principles of\r\nconstruction, as will readily be seen, were the same in Greece as in\r\nEgypt, but improved, added to, and perfected. The architecture of both\r\ncountries was columnar; but, compare the Greek columns before us with\r\nthose which we just now saw in Egypt, taken from the tomb of Beni\r\nHassan: the latter are simple, rude, ill-proportioned, and with slight\r\npretension to beauty, whilst, in the former, the simplicity still\r\nprevailing, the rudeness and heaviness have departed, the pillars taper\r\ngracefully, and are finely proportioned and elegant, though of great\r\nstrength. The specimen of Greek architecture before us is from the later\r\nperiod of the first order, namely, the Doric; and the court is taken, in\r\npart, from the Temple of Jupiter at Nemea, which was built about 400\r\nyears B.C., still within the verge of the highest period of Greek Art.\r\nPassing along the front, we notice on the frieze above the columns the\r\nnames of the principal Greek cities and colonies.\r\n\r\n  [6] See “Handbook to the Greek Court,” by George Scharf, jun.; also,\r\n  “An Apology for the Colouring of the Greek Court,” by Owen Jones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Greek Court.]\r\n\r\nWe enter the court through the central opening. This portion represents\r\npart of a Greek _agora_, or forum, which was used as a market, and also\r\nfor public festivals, for political and other assemblies. Around the\r\nfrieze in this central division are the names of the poets, artists, and\r\nphilosophers of Greece, and of their most celebrated patrons, the list\r\ncommencing immediately above the place of entrance with old blind Homer,\r\nand finishing with Anthemius, the architect of Saint Sophia at\r\nConstantinople. The names, it will be remarked, are inserted in the\r\nGreek characters of the period at which the various persons lived. The\r\nmonograms within the chaplets on the frieze are formed of the initial\r\nletters of the Muses, the Graces, the Good and the Wise. The colouring\r\nof this court, with its blue, red, and yellow surfaces, blazoned with\r\ngold, produces an excellent effect. It is the object of the decorators\r\nto give to the whole of the architectural specimens in the Crystal\r\nPalace those colours which there is reason to know, or to believe they\r\noriginally possessed; to restore them, in fact, as far as possible, to\r\ntheir pristine state, in order that the imagination of the spectator may\r\nbe safely conducted back in contemplation to the artistic\r\ncharacteristics of distant and distinctive ages. In this court are\r\narranged sculptures and models of temples. Amongst the former will be\r\nrecognised many of the finest statues and groups of the Greek school,\r\nthe Laocoon (16); the Farnese Juno (6); the Dione (3); the Genius of\r\nDeath (24); the well-known Discobolus (4) from the Vatican; the Ariadne,\r\nalso from the Vatican (27); the Sleeping or Barberini Faun (19); and, in\r\nthe centre, the unrivalled Venus of Milo, which affords perhaps the most\r\nperfect combination of grandeur and beauty in the female form (1). We\r\nmake our way round this court, beginning at the right hand. After\r\nexamining the collection, we pass between the columns into the small\r\nside court (next to Egypt), answering to a stoa of the Agora. Around the\r\nfrieze are found the names of the great men of the Greek colonies,\r\narranged in chronological order. The visitor has here an opportunity of\r\ncontrasting the architecture and sculpture of the Egyptians with those\r\nof the Greeks. On one side of him is an Egyptian wall inclining inwards,\r\nwith its angular pictorial decorations, and the passive colossal figures\r\nguarding the entrances. On the other side are the beautiful columns and\r\nbold cornice of the Greek Doric, surrounded by statues characterised by\r\nbeauty of form and refined idealised expression. In this division will\r\nalso be found the busts of the Greek Poets, arranged in chronological\r\norder, commencing on the right-hand side from the Nave: these form a\r\nportion and the commencement of the Portrait Gallery of the Crystal\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\nMaking our way through the opening in the back, opposite the Nave, we\r\nenter a covered atrium, commonly attached to the portion of the agora\r\nhere reproduced. The massive _antæ_, or square pillars, and the panelled\r\nceiling--the form of the latter adapted from the Temple of Apollo at\r\nBassæ in Arcadia--give the visitor another specimen of Greek\r\narchitecture. We proceed, to the right, down this atrium, occasionally\r\nstepping out to examine the sculpture arranged in the gallery, and the\r\nrestored and coloured frieze of the Parthenon of Athens, which extends\r\nits length along the wall. The coloured portion has been executed under\r\nthe direction of Mr. Owen Jones, the golden hair being founded on\r\nauthentic examples which still exist on analogous remains of ancient\r\nGreek art.[7] The tints on the different figures are put forth rather as\r\nsuggestions than restorations. We really know nothing certain of the\r\nmanner in which these celebrated relievos were coloured. Acknowledging\r\nthis fact, Mr. Jones, in thus boldly supplying pigment, has proceeded\r\nupon the known principle of the Greeks--using the tints so as to enhance\r\nthe effect of the sculpture. This frieze represents the Panathenaic\r\nprocession to the temple of Athene Polias, which formed part of the\r\ndisplay at this greatest of the Athenian festivals, and took place every\r\nfourth year. Dividing the frieze, is one of the most interesting objects\r\nin the Crystal Palace, a model of the western front of the Parthenon\r\nitself, about one-fourth the size of the original structure. This is the\r\nlargest model that has ever been constructed of this beautiful temple,\r\nand possesses the great charm of a veritable copy. The scale is\r\nsufficiently large to give a complete idea of the original. This\r\nadmirable model is due to the intelligent and successful researches\r\nprosecuted in Athens by Mr. Penrose, whose labours have thrown so much\r\nnew light upon the refinements practised by the Greeks in architecture.\r\nMr. Penrose has himself directed the construction of the model. In this\r\ngallery are ranged statues and groups, including the celebrated Niobe\r\ngroup, from Florence (187 to 187 L, inclusive). This subject of the\r\npunishment of Niobe’s family by the gods was frequently treated by Greek\r\nartists; and certainly the group before us is one of the most beautiful\r\nexamples of Greek sculptural art. It is supposed that the portion of the\r\ngroup at Florence occupied the pediment of the temple of Apollo Sosianus\r\nat Rome. The Niobe group belongs to one of the brightest periods. Casts\r\nfrom those most beautiful and wonderful remains of ancient art, the\r\ncolossal figures from the pediment of the Parthenon at Athens, are also\r\nhere (185 to 186 B). The originals, brought over to England by Lord\r\nElgin in 1801-2, are in the British Museum, and the nation is indebted\r\nfor the acquisition to the painter Haydon, who was the first British\r\nartist to recognise the value, and appreciate the beauty, of these\r\nmutilated but inimitable monuments of art at the highest period of its\r\nglory. They belong to the Phidian school, and are characterised by\r\nsimple grandeur, great repose in the attitudes, and a deep study of\r\nnature in their forms. The Theseus more particularly displays a\r\nmarvellous study and appreciation of nature, and the figures of the\r\nFates (185 B), headless though they be, are the most awfully grand\r\nimpersonations the world has ever seen. In connection with the Parthenon\r\nwill also be seen a cast from a part of one of the actual columns, also\r\nin the British Museum (150). Here also is the wonderful Belvedere Torso,\r\nfrom the Vatican (67); the far-famed Venus de’ Medici (198), from\r\nFlorence, and the exquisite Psyche (199), from the Museum at Naples. The\r\nvisitor will not fail to be astonished, no less by the number than by\r\nthe charming effect of these works which have come down to our time, and\r\nwhich will descend to the latest posterity as models of excellence.\r\nProceeding until we arrive at the junction of the Greek and Roman\r\nCourts, we turn into the right-hand division of the outer court; round\r\nthe frieze of which are the names of the statesmen and warriors of\r\nAthens, the Peloponnesus, and Attica. The busts ranged on either side\r\nare portraits of the Greek philosophers, orators, generals, and\r\nstatesmen, arranged in chronological order, commencing at the entrance\r\nfrom the Nave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [7] The remainder of the frieze is erected in the gallery above the\r\n  Courts.\r\n\r\nWe walk through this court until we reach the Nave; then turning to the\r\nleft, find ourselves facing\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN COURT[8]\r\n\r\nOn approaching this Court, the visitor will at once notice a new\r\narchitectural element--as useful as it is beautiful--namely, the ARCH, a\r\nfeature that has been found susceptible of the greatest variety of\r\ntreatment. Until within the last few years the credit of the first use\r\nof the arch as an _architectural principle_ has been given to the Greek\r\narchitect under Roman rule, but discoveries in Egypt, and more recently\r\nin Assyria by Mr. Layard and M. Botta, have shown that constructed and\r\nornamented arches were frequently employed in architecture many hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era. It is to be observed that architecture\r\nand sculpture had no original growth at Rome, and were not indigenous to\r\nthe soil. Roman structures were modifications from the Greek, adapted to\r\nsuit the requirements and tastes of the people; and thus it happened\r\nthat the simple severity, purity, and ideality of early Greek art\r\ndegenerated, under the Roman empire, into the wanton luxuriousness that\r\ncharacterised its latest period. In comparing the Greek and Roman\r\nstatues, we remark a grandeur of conception, a delicacy of sentiment, a\r\npoetical refinement of thought in the former, indicative of the highest\r\nartistic development with which we are acquainted. When Greece became\r\nmerely a Roman province, that high excellence was already on the\r\ndecline, and the dispersion of her artists, on the final subjugation of\r\nthe country by Mummius, the Roman general, B.C. 146, hastened the\r\ndescent. A large number of Grecian artists settled at Rome, where the\r\nsentiment of servitude, and the love of their masters for display,\r\nproduced works which by degrees fell further and further from their\r\nglorious models, until richness of material, manual cunning, and a more\r\nthan feminine weakness characterised their principal productions; and\r\nthe sculptor’s art became degraded into a trade, in which all feeling\r\nfor the ancient Greek excellence was for ever lost. Thus, in the\r\ntransplanted art of Greece, serving its Roman masters, a material and\r\nsensual feeling more or less prevails, appealing to the passions rather\r\nthan to the intellects and high imaginations of men. The cumbrous\r\ndresses and armour which mark the properly Roman style, hide the\r\ngraceful and powerful forms of nature under the symbols of station and\r\noffice, creating a species of political sculpture. It is very curious\r\nand instructive to notice at a glance the high intellectual expression\r\nof the great men of Greece whose busts adorn the Greek Court, and to\r\ncontrast their noble countenances with the material and sensual aspect\r\nof their conquerors, the Romans, who range peacefully close by: much of\r\nthe past can be gleaned from such a comparison.\r\n\r\n  [8] See “Handbook to the Roman Court,” by George Scharf, jun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Roman Court.]\r\n\r\nIn the wall now before us we have a model of a portion of the outer wall\r\nof the Coliseum at Rome, pierced with arches and ornamented with Tuscan\r\ncolumns. The Coliseum is one of the most wonderful structures in the\r\nworld, and the Pyramids of Egypt alone can be compared with it in point\r\nof size. It is elliptical in form, and consisted outwardly of four\r\nstories. In the centre of the interior was the _arena_ or scene of\r\naction, around which the seats for spectators rose, tier above tier. The\r\nenormous range was capable of seating 87,000 persons. Vespasian and\r\nTitus erected this amphitheatre, and the work commenced about A.D. 79.\r\nIn this vast and splendidly decorated building, the ancient Romans\r\nassembled to witness chariot-races, naval engagements, combats of wild\r\nanimals, and other exciting sports. A very beautiful and highly finished\r\nmodel of the Coliseum restored will be found in the Court, which it will\r\nbe interesting to compare with the present state of the ruin as seen in\r\nthe model of the Roman Forum close by. A model also of the Pantheon will\r\nbe found here. These were all executed at Rome under the superintendence\r\nof the late Dr. Emil Braun.\r\n\r\nEntering the Roman Court through the central archway, we come into an\r\napartment whose walls are coloured in imitation of the porphyry,\r\nmalachite, and rare marbles with which the Roman people loved to adorn\r\ntheir houses. This style of decoration appears to have been introduced a\r\nlittle before the Christian era; and so lavish were the Romans in\r\nsupplying ornament for their homes, that the Emperor Augustus, dreading\r\nthe result of the extravagance, endeavoured by his personal moderation\r\nto put a stop to the reckless expenditure: although it is recorded that\r\nthe lofty exemplar was set up for imitation in vain.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same plan as in the Greek Court, we proceed round from the\r\nright to the left, examining the sculptures and models. Amongst the\r\nformer will be noticed the statue of Drusus from Naples (222); the\r\nbeautiful Venus Aphrodite from the Capitol, Rome (226); the Venus\r\nGenitrix from the Louvre (228); the fine statue of a musician, or female\r\nperformer on the lyre, from the Louvre (230); the Genius Suppliant\r\n(232); the Marine Venus (233); the Venus Aphrodite from Florence (236);\r\nthe Venus of Arles (237); the Venus Callipygos from Naples (238); and\r\nthe Bacchus from the Louvre (241). Around the Court are placed the\r\nportrait-busts of the most celebrated kings and emperors of Rome,\r\narranged chronologically, commencing, on the right-hand side of the\r\nentrance, with Numa Pompilius (34), and terminating with Constantius\r\nChlorus (73). Having completed our survey, we enter the arched vestibule\r\nat the back adjoining the Greek Court. This vestibule, and the three\r\nothers adjacent, are founded, in respect of their decorations and\r\npaintings, on examples still extant in the ancient baths of Rome. The\r\nbath, as is well known, was indispensable to the Romans, and in the days\r\nof their “decadence,” when they had sunk from glorious conquerors and\r\nmighty generals into the mere indolent slaves of luxury, the warm bath\r\nwas used to excess. It is said that it was resorted to as often as seven\r\nor eight times a day, and even used immediately after a meal, to assist\r\nthe digestive organs, and to enable the bather to enjoy, with as little\r\ndelay as possible, another luxurious repast.\r\n\r\nWe proceed through these vestibules, as in the Greek Court, studying the\r\nobjects of art, and occasionally stepping out to notice the continuation\r\nof the Parthenon frieze on the wall at the back, and the sculptures\r\nranged around. In the centre of the first vestibule is the Venus\r\nVictorious (243); and in the third, the Diana with the deer (261),--two\r\nchefs-d’œuvre of sculpture, that give an idea of the highest state of\r\nart under Roman rule. We soon arrive at the sides of the Alhambra, when,\r\nturning to the right, we find ourselves in a Roman side court, which is\r\nsurrounded by the busts of the most renowned Roman Generals, of\r\nEmpresses and other women.\r\n\r\nPassing through this compartment, we once more make our way to the Nave,\r\nand bring ourselves face to face with the gorgeous magnificence of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALHAMBRA COURT.[9]\r\n\r\nThe architectural sequence is now interrupted. We have arrived at one of\r\nthose offshoots from a parent stem which flourished for a time, and then\r\nentirely disappeared: leaving examples of their art which either compel\r\nour wonder by the extraordinary novelty of the details, as in the case\r\nof Nineveh, or, as in the court now before us, excite our admiration to\r\nthe highest pitch, by the splendour and richness of the decorations. The\r\nSaracenic or Moresque architecture sprang from the Byzantine, the common\r\nparent of all subsequent styles, and the legitimate successor to the\r\nRoman system. We shall immediately have occasion to speak more\r\nparticularly of the parent root when we cross the Nave and enter the\r\nByzantine Court. Of the Moorish architecture which branched out from it,\r\nit will be sufficient to say here, that the solid external structure was\r\nof plain, simple masonry; whilst the inside was literally covered, from\r\nend to end, with rich arabesque work in coloured stucco, and adorned\r\nwith mosaic pavements, marble fountains, and sweet-smelling flowers.\r\n\r\n  [9] See “Handbook to the Alhambra Court,” by Owen Jones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to Alhambra Court.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan of the Alhambra Court.]\r\n\r\nThe vast fortress-palace of the Alhambra,[10] of a portion of which this\r\ncourt is a reproduction, was built about the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. It rises on a hill above the city of Granada (in the south of\r\nSpain), the capital of the Moorish kingdom of that name, which, for two\r\nhundred and fifty years, withstood the repeated attacks of the\r\nChristians, and was not finally reduced until 1492, by Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella. The Alhambra, under Moorish rule, was the scene of the\r\nluxurious pleasures of the monarch, and the stage upon which many\r\nfearful crimes were enacted. Within its brilliant courts, the king fell\r\nby the hand of the aspiring chief, who, in his turn, was cut down by an\r\nequally ambitious rival. Few spots can boast a more intimate association\r\nwith the romantic than the Alhambra, until the Christians ejected the\r\nMoors from their splendid home, and the palace of the unbeliever became\r\na Christian fortress.\r\n\r\n  [10] “The Red,” probably so called either from the colour of the soil,\r\n  or from the deep red brick of which it is built.\r\n\r\nThe part here reproduced is the far-famed Court of Lions, the Tribunal\r\nof Justice, and the Hall of the Abencerrages and the Divan. The outside\r\nof these courts is covered with diaper work, consisting of inscriptions\r\nin Arabic character, of conventional representation of flowers and of\r\nflowing decoration, over which the eye wanders, delighted with the\r\nharmony of the colouring and the variety of the ornament. Entering\r\nthrough the central archway, we see before us the fountain, supported by\r\nthe lions that give name to the court; and, through the archway\r\nopposite, the splendid fringe of the stalactite roof of the Hall of the\r\nAbencerrages, composed in the original of five thousand separate pieces,\r\nwhich key into and support each other. The Court of Lions here is 75\r\nfeet long, just two-thirds the length of the original; the columns are\r\nthe same height and size as the columns of which they are restorations,\r\nand the arches that spring from them are also of the actual size of the\r\noriginal arches. Over the columns is inscribed in Cufic characters,\r\n“_And there is no Conqueror but God._” Round the basin of the fountain\r\nis an Arabic poem, from which we take two specimens:--\r\n\r\n    “Oh thou who beholdest these Lions crouching--fear not!\r\n     Life is wanting to enable them to show their fury!”\r\n\r\nLess, we must think, a needless caution to the intruder, than the poet’s\r\nallowed flattery to his brother artist. In the verse of Greece and\r\nmodern Italy, we find the same heightened expression of admiration for\r\nthe almost animating art of sculpture. The following passage is oriental\r\nin every letter:--\r\n\r\n    “Seest thou not how the water flows on the surface,\r\n     notwithstanding the current strives to oppose its progress.\r\n     Like a lover whose eyelids are pregnant with tears, and\r\n     who suppresses them for fear of a tale-bearer.”\r\n\r\nThrough this brilliant court, the visitor will proceed or linger as his\r\nspirit directs. There are no statues to examine, for the religion of the\r\nMoors forbade the representation of living objects; in truth, the\r\nexquisitely wrought tracery on every side, upon which the Moorish mind\r\nwas thus forced to concentrate all its artistic power and skill, is in\r\nitself sufficient exclusively to arrest and to enchain the attention. A\r\ncurious infringement, however, of the Mahommedan law just now mentioned,\r\nwhich proscribes the representation of natural objects, is observable in\r\nthe lions supporting the fountain, and in three paintings, which occupy\r\na portion of the original ceilings in the Tribunal of Justice and the\r\ntwo alcoves adjoining. It is also to be remarked that, although the\r\nfollowers of Mahommed scrupulously avoid stepping upon a piece of paper,\r\nlest the name of God should be written thereon, yet that name is found\r\nrepeatedly upon the floor of the same tribunal. However, during the\r\nState visit of the Princes of Oude to the Crystal Palace in 1858, while\r\nthey were inspecting this Court it was noticed that they, and many of\r\ntheir attendants, avoided as much as possible stepping upon the\r\ninscribed pavement. From these circumstances it would seem that the\r\nMahommedans of the West were more lax in their observances than their\r\nbrethren of the East, having in all probability imbibed some of the\r\nideas and feelings of the Spanish Christians with whom they came in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nPassing through the archway opposite to that at which we entered, we\r\nfind ourselves in a vestibule which in the Alhambra itself leads from\r\nthe Court of Lions to the Tribunal of Justice. This is, however, only a\r\nportion of the original passage. The arches opening from the central to\r\nthe right and left divisions of the vestibule are of the size of the\r\noriginals, the patterns on the Avails and ceilings being taken from\r\nother portions of the Alhambra. It should also be remembered that the\r\ndifferent apartments here brought together do not stand in the same\r\nrelation to each other as in the Moorish Palace, the object of the\r\narchitect in the Crystal Palace being to give the best examples of this\r\nstyle of architecture in the smallest possible space.\r\n\r\nThe visitor may now proceed through the left-hand arch into the division\r\nnext the Roman Court. On the right of this division he will find a small\r\nroom devoted to models, and specimens of the original casts of ornaments\r\nof the Alhambra, brought by Mr. Owen Jones from Spain, from which this\r\nCourt has been constructed. Returning to the central division, he sees\r\non his left the Hall of the Abencerrages, with its beautiful stalactite\r\nroof, already spoken of. All the Courts on this side of the building, up\r\nto this point, were erected under the superintendence of Mr. Owen Jones.\r\nProceeding onward, we quit the Alhambra, and emerge into the north\r\ntransept.\r\n\r\nThe visitor passing into the Tropical division now crosses the Transept,\r\nimmediately in front of the colossal sitting figures, which he will be\r\nable to examine with more effect when he commences a tour through the\r\nnave, which we propose that he shall shortly make. Passing these figures\r\nthen for a moment, he directs his attention to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pillar from the arcade of the Court.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSYRIAN COURT,[11]\r\n\r\nwhich faces him. This Court is larger than any other appropriated to the\r\nillustration of one phase of art. It is 120 feet long, 50 feet wide, and\r\nhas an elevation of 40 feet from the floor line. Its chief interest,\r\nhowever, consists in the fact of its illustrating a style of art of\r\nwhich no specimen has hitherto been presented in Europe, and which,\r\nindeed, until the last few years, lay unknown even in the country where\r\nits remains have been unexpectedly brought to light. It is little more\r\nthan ten years ago that M. Botta, the French Consul at Mossul, first\r\ndiscovered the existence of sculptural remains of the old Assyrian\r\nempire at Khorsabad: and since that time the palace, now known to have\r\nbeen erected about the year 720 B.C. by Sargon, the successor of\r\nShalmaneser, has been mainly explored, as well as the palace of his son\r\nSennacherib at Koyunjik, and that of Esarhaddon and Sardanapalus, at\r\nNimroud, besides other older palaces in the last-named locality. In\r\naddition to the explorations that have been made on these sites,\r\nextensive excavations and examinations also within the last few years\r\nhave been made into the ruins of the palaces of Nebuchadnezzar at\r\nBabylon, and of Darius and Xerxes at Susa.\r\n\r\n  [11] See “Handbook to the Nineveh Court,” by Austen Henry Layard.\r\n\r\nIt is from the immense mass of new materials, so suddenly revealed,\r\nthat Mr. James Fergusson, assisted by Mr. Layard, has erected the court\r\nbefore which the visitor now stands--an architectural illustration\r\nwhich, without pretending to be a literal copy of any one building, most\r\ncertainly represents generally the architecture of the extinct but once\r\nmighty kingdoms of Mesopotamia, during the two centuries that elapsed\r\nbetween the reign of Sennacherib and that of Xerxes, viz., from about\r\nB.C. 700 to B.C. 500.\r\n\r\nThe oldest form of architecture in these Eastern parts was probably that\r\nwhich existed in Babylon: but the absence of stone in that country\r\nreduced the inhabitants to the necessity of using bricks only, and for\r\nthe most part bricks burnt by the sun, though sometimes fire-burnt\r\nbrickwork is also found. The face of the walls so constructed was\r\nornamented with paintings, either on plaster or enamelled on the bricks,\r\nwhilst the constructive portions and roofs were of wood. All this\r\nperishable material has of course disappeared, and nothing now remains\r\neven of the Babylon built by Nebuchadnezzar but formless mounds of\r\nbrickwork. In the more northern kingdom of Assyria, the existence of\r\nstone and marble secured a wainscoting of sculptured slabs for the\r\npalace walls, whilst great winged bulls and giant figures, also in\r\nstone, adorned the portals and façades. The pillars, however, which\r\nsupported the roofs, and the roofs themselves, were all of wood,\r\ngenerally of cedar, and these having been destroyed by fire or by the\r\nlapse of ages, nothing remains to tell of their actual size and form.\r\nYet we are not left entirely to conjecture in respect of them. Susa and\r\nPersepolis in Persia--the followers and imitators of Nineveh--arose in\r\ndistricts where stone was abundant, and we find that the structures in\r\nthese cities had not only stone pillars to support the roof, but also\r\nstone jambs in the doorways, thus affording an unmistakeable clue to the\r\nnature of such portions of building as are wanting to complete our\r\nknowledge of the architecture of the Assyrian people.\r\n\r\nAs now laid bare to us, the Assyrian style of architecture differs\r\nessentially from any other with which we have hitherto been made\r\nacquainted. Its main characteristics are enormously thick mud-brick\r\nwalls, covered with painted bas-reliefs, and roofs supported internally\r\nby slight but elegant wooden columns, ornamented with volutes (spiral\r\nmouldings), and the elegant honeysuckle ornament which was afterwards\r\nintroduced through Ionia into Greece--this Assyrian style being,\r\naccording to some, the parent of the Ionic order, as the Egyptian was of\r\nthe Doric order, of Greece. The very greatest interest attaches to these\r\narchitectural remains, and to the records cut in enduring stone, which\r\nthey have handed down to us, inasmuch as they corroborate, in a most\r\nremarkable manner, certain statements in the Bible connected with Jewish\r\nHistory. There can be little doubt that the Assyrians and Jews sprang\r\nfrom the same stock; and no one can fail to remark that the physiognomy\r\nof the Assyrians, as pourtrayed in these sculptures, bears a strong\r\nresemblance to the Israelitish visage. As far as we can judge from\r\ndescriptions, the architecture of ancient Jerusalem was almost identical\r\nwith that of Assyria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to the Nineveh Court.]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the lower portion of the exterior front and sides of this\r\nCourt is taken from the palace at Khorsabad, the great winged bulls,\r\nthe giants strangling the lions (supposed to represent the Assyrian\r\nHercules), and the other features, being casts from the objects sent\r\nfrom the site of the palace, to the Louvre, and arranged, as far as\r\ncircumstances admit, in the relative position of the original objects as\r\nthey were discovered. The dwarf columns on the walls, with the double\r\nbull capitals, are modelled from details found at Persepolis and Susa,\r\nwhilst the cornice and battlements above have been copied from\r\nrepresentations found in one of the bas-reliefs at Khorsabad. The\r\npainting of the cornice is in strict accordance with the recent\r\ndiscoveries of that place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Assyrian Court.]\r\n\r\nEntering through the opening in the side, guarded by colossal bulls, the\r\nvisitor finds himself in a large hall, in the centre of which stand four\r\ngreat columns copied literally from columns found at Susa and\r\nPersepolis. The walls of the hall are covered with sculpture, cast from\r\noriginals brought to this country by Mr. Layard from his excavations at\r\nNimroud, and deposited in the British Museum. Upon the sculptures are\r\nengraved the arrow-headed inscriptions which have been so recently, and\r\nin so remarkable a manner, deciphered by Colonel Rawlinson and Dr.\r\nHincks. Above these is a painting of animals and trees, copied from one\r\nfound at Khorsabad. The roof crowning the hall represents the form of\r\nceiling usual in that part of Asia, but is rather a vehicle for the\r\ndisplay of the various coloured patterns of Assyrian art than a direct\r\ncopy of anything found in the Assyrian palaces. In the centre of the\r\ngreat hall the visitor will notice a decorated archway at the back of\r\nthe Court. The very recent discovery of this highly ornamented arch at\r\nKhorsabad, and also of a pointed example, proves--somewhat\r\nunexpectedly--that the Assyrian people were far from ignorant of the\r\nvalue of these beautiful features of architecture. A complete detailed\r\naccount of this interesting department will be found in Mr. Layard’s\r\nvaluable Handbook to the Nineveh Court.\r\n\r\nHaving completed his survey of the interior of this Court, the visitor\r\nmay at once quit the Court by the central entrance, and turning to the\r\nleft cross the north end of the Nave, stopping for one moment on his\r\npassage to look from end to end of the magnificent structure within\r\nwhich he stands, and to glance at the exterior of the Court he has just\r\nquitted, the bright colouring of which, the bold ornaments, the gigantic\r\nbulls, and colossal features, present as novel and striking an\r\narchitectural and decorative display as the mind can imagine.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the building, past the avenue of Sphinxes, without\r\nstopping at the colossal Egyptian figures to be noticed hereafter, the\r\nvisitor will continue the architectural illustrations with\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BYZANTINE AND ROMANESQUE COURT.[12]\r\n\r\nBefore the visitor is conducted through the architectural Courts on this\r\nside of the Nave, which have all been erected by Mr. Digby Wyatt, it is\r\nnecessary he should understand that they differ considerably in\r\narrangement and treatment from those on the opposite side, which have\r\nalready been described. In the Egyptian, Greek, and other Courts through\r\nwhich he has passed, the forms or characteristics of some one\r\ndistinctive structure have, to a greater or less extent, been given; but\r\nthe Courts into which we are now about to penetrate are not\r\narchitectural restorations, but rather so many collections of ornamental\r\ndetails stamped with unmistakeable individuality, and enabling us at a\r\nglance to recognise and distinguish the several styles that have existed\r\nand succeeded each other, from the beginning of the 6th down to the 16th\r\ncentury. In each Court will be found important details, ornament, and\r\neven entire portions, taken from the most remarkable or beautiful\r\nedifices of the periods they illustrate. Thus the palaces and Christian\r\ntemples of Italy, the castles and churches of Germany, the\r\nhôtels-de-ville and châteaux of Belgium and France, and the cathedrals\r\nand mansions in our own country, have all been laid under contribution,\r\nso that here, for the first time in the history of architecture, we\r\nhave the opportunity of acquiring a perceptive and practical knowledge\r\nof the beautiful art during the period of its later progress.\r\n\r\n  [12] See “Handbook to the Byzantine Court,” by M. Digby Wyatt and J.\r\n  B. Waring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Byzantine Court (entrance from North Transept).]\r\n\r\nThe regular architectural sequence on the other side of the Nave finds\r\nits termination in the Roman Court, and we now resume the order of\r\nhistory with the “Byzantine” Court. Art, as we have already indicated,\r\ndeclined during the Roman Empire; but the general adoption of\r\nChristianity gave the blow that finally overthrew it; for the\r\nintroduction of this faith was, unfortunately, accompanied with bitter\r\nand violent enmity against all Pagan forms of beauty. An edict of\r\nTheodosius, in the early part of the 5th century, ordered that pagan art\r\nshould be utterly annihilated, and the primitive Christians demolished\r\nwith frantic zeal the temples, bronzes, paintings, and statues that\r\nadorned the Romish capital.\r\n\r\nTo complete the work of destruction, it is related that Gregory (A.D.\r\n590), one of the celebrated “Fathers” of the Roman Church, gave orders\r\nthat every vestige of Pagan Rome should be consigned to the Tiber; and\r\nthus was ancient Art smitten and overthrown, and the attempt made to\r\nefface its very foot-prints from the earth; so that, indeed, men had now\r\nto proceed as best they might, by painful and laborious efforts, towards\r\nthe formation of a new and essentially Christian style of architecture,\r\nwhich, however feeble and badly imitated from ancient models at its\r\ncommencement, was finally productive of the most original and beautiful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nConstantine the Great, in the early part of the 4th century, embraced\r\nChristianity. The new religion required structures capable of holding\r\nlarge assemblages of people at certain periods; and notwithstanding the\r\nmagnificence of some of the Roman structures, none could be found\r\nappropriate to the required use, save the Basilicas, or Halls of\r\nJustice, at Rome. The form of these structures was oblong, and the\r\ninterior consisted of a central avenue and two side aisles, divided from\r\nthe centre by a double row of columns, the central avenue terminating in\r\na semicircular recess with the roof rounded off. It will be at once\r\napparent that such buildings were admirably adapted to the purposes and\r\nobservances of the new religion; and, accordingly, in A.D. 323, when\r\nConstantine removed the seat of empire from the West to the East, from\r\nRome to Byzantium (Constantinople), the Roman Basilica probably served\r\nas a model for the Christian churches which he rapidly raised in his new\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nBut on this point we have little authentic information; time, the\r\nconvulsions of nature, and the destructive hand of man, have long since\r\nlost to us the original churches built on Constantine’s settlement at\r\nByzantium, and the oldest monument with which we are acquainted, that of\r\nSanta Sophia, built in the early part of the 6th century by Justinian,\r\nbears no relation in its plan to the long basilica of the Western\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Greek Cross.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Latin Cross.]\r\n\r\nThe great characteristic of Byzantine church architecture was a plan\r\nformed on the Greek cross, and surmounted at its points of intersection\r\nby a central dome. The direct imitation of the antique capitals was\r\neschewed, and a foliated capital was introduced in its place, varying\r\nconsiderably in pattern even in the same building: the arch was in\r\ngeneral semicircular, and the use of mosaic ornament universal, but it\r\nwas some time before the Byzantine style received its full development;\r\nfor the earlier Christians generally maintained a profound antipathy to\r\nall Art, as ostentatious, and savouring overmuch of worldly delights.\r\nIt is not, however, in the nature of man to exist for any length of time\r\nin this world, wondrously adorned as it is by its Divine Creator,\r\nwithout imbibing a love for the adornment so profusely displayed around\r\nhim. This natural feeling, which St. Augustine and the stricter\r\nChristians vainly sought to decry and repress, was strengthened and\r\naided by the more forcible notion of holding out some attraction to the\r\npagans, who, accustomed to the ceremonies and charms of their old rites,\r\nmight be repelled by the apparent gloominess of the new creed. As the\r\nnumber of converts increased, a demand for church ornament made itself\r\nfelt, and Art once more awoke, not in the excelling beauty of its former\r\nlife, but rude, unpolished, and crippled by religious necessity, which\r\nplaced, as in Egypt of old, a restriction upon the forms of nature, lest\r\nby copying them the people should relapse into the idolatrous worship of\r\ngraven images. In the Eastern or Greek Church, even the rude and\r\ngrotesque sculpture first allowed was speedily forbidden and banished\r\nfor ever. The mosaic painting, however, was continued by Greek artists,\r\nand this peculiar style of ornamentation is one of the most distinctive\r\nfeatures of Byzantine architecture. Not only were the walls and ceilings\r\ncovered with extraordinarily rich examples of glass mosaic work, formed\r\ninto pictures illustrative of Scripture subjects and saintly legends, or\r\narranged in elaborate patterns of geometrical and other ornament, but\r\ncolumns, pulpits, &c., were rendered brilliant with its glowing colours.\r\nMosaic work also is at times found on the façades of the Byzantine\r\nbuildings; whilst the pavement, if less gorgeous, was at least as richly\r\nornamented with coloured inlay of _marble_ mosaic. As we have, however,\r\njust observed, the fear of idolatry led to the comparative neglect of\r\nsculpture, and the edict forbidding the sculpture of images for\r\nreligious purposes became one cause of the separation of the Latin\r\nChurch in Rome from the Greek Church in Constantinople, and thenceforth\r\nthe two churches remain distinct. In the former, sculpture continued to\r\nexist, not as an independent art, but as a mere architectural accessory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Byzantine Court--Arches from the Nave.]\r\n\r\nByzantine architecture flourished from A.D. 328 to 1453; but the\r\nByzantine proper can be said to extend only from the 6th to the 11th\r\ncenturies. Romanesque architecture in its various developments was more\r\nor less impressed with the Byzantine character, and in its general\r\nfeatures resembles the source from which it was in a great measure\r\nderived; although the dome is generally absent in the churches of\r\nnorthern Europe, which retained the plan of the old Roman basilica in\r\npreference to that of the Greek cross, for a long time peculiar to the\r\nEastern Church.\r\n\r\nIt would not be hazarding too much to assert that Byzantine architecture\r\nwas generally adopted throughout most European countries from the 6th to\r\nthe 11th century, with such modifications as the necessities of climate,\r\nthe differences of creed, and the means of building necessitated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan of Byzantine Court.]\r\n\r\nBefore entering this court the visitor will do well to examine its\r\nexternal decoration, affording, as it does, not only an excellent notion\r\nof the splendid mosaic ornament, we have already alluded to as\r\npeculiarly Byzantine, but for its paintings of illustrious characters of\r\nthe Byzantine period, taken from valuable illuminations and mosaics\r\nstill in existence; such as the fine portraits of Justinian and his\r\nconsort Theodora, from Ravenna (by the entrance from the Nave), and\r\nthose of Charles the Bald of France, and the Emperor Nicephorus\r\nBotoniates of Constantinople, copied from valuable existing authorities;\r\nwhilst an allegorical representation of Night, on the return side, is a\r\nproof that the poetry of Art was not altogether dead in the 10th\r\ncentury, to which date it belongs.\r\n\r\nIn front of all the courts facing the Nave, are placed many very\r\ninteresting examples of Mediæval and Renaissance Art, a brief notice of\r\nwhich will be found later in this volume.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the gallery at the back of the Byzantine Court is formed\r\nby the Chancel Arch of Tuam Cathedral in Ireland, built about the\r\nbeginning or middle of the 13th century, a most interesting relic of art\r\nin the Sister Isle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arch and Column from Cloister.]\r\n\r\nEntering through the arches from the North Transept, we turn to the\r\nright into a cool cloister of the Romanesque school, a restored copy of\r\na cloister at the church of Santa Maria in Capitolo, at Cologne, an\r\nancient edifice said to have been commenced about the year 700. The\r\ncloister is, however, of the close of the 10th century. The restoration\r\ngives us an excellent notion of the arches, columns, and capitals of\r\nthis period, and shows the difference that exists between Byzantine and\r\nancient Greek or Roman art. Proceeding through the cloister, the roof of\r\nwhich is beautifully decorated with Byzantine ornament, in imitation of\r\nthe glass mosaic work, we remark various pieces of sculpture, chiefly\r\nfrom Venice: at the extreme end, to the left, having our back to the\r\nNave, is a recumbent effigy of Richard Cœur de Lion, from Rouen; at the\r\nfarthest end, to the right, is placed the Prior’s doorway from Ely, in a\r\nlate Norman style; and next to this, to the right, a representation of\r\nthe Baptism of Christ, from St. Mark’s, at Venice. We enter the court\r\nitself. The marble fountain in the centre is an exact copy of one at\r\nHeisterbach on the Rhine. We may now obtain some notion of the different\r\nfeatures which mark the Byzantine, the German Romanesque, and Norman\r\nstyles; all agreeing in general character, but all varying in treatment.\r\nThe cloister we have just quitted, with the cubical capitals of its\r\nexternal columns and its profuse mosaics, presents a strongly marked\r\nimpress of the Byzantine style, the same influence being also remarked\r\nin the external mosaic work of the small but beautiful portion of the\r\ncloisters of St. John Lateran at Rome; on each side of which are fine\r\nexamples of German Romanesque, which is frequently also called the\r\nLombard style, as indicative of its origin; and beyond these again, in\r\nthe extreme angles, are interesting specimens of the Norman style as\r\npractised in England during the 12th century. These examples will enable\r\nthe visitor to judge in some measure of the differences that\r\ncharacterise the three. To the left is a very curious Norman doorway,\r\nfrom Kilpeck Church, in Herefordshire; the zigzag moulding around it is\r\npeculiar to the Norman; and in the sculptured reliefs which surround the\r\ndoorway a symbolism is hidden, for the meaning of which we must refer\r\nour readers to the Handbook of this Court. Next to this is a doorway\r\nfrom Mayence Cathedral, the bronze doors within it, which are from\r\nAugsburg Cathedral, in Germany, being interesting examples of the art of\r\nbronze-casting in the latter half of the 11th century. The\r\nrudely-executed subjects in the panels are mostly taken from the Old\r\nTestament, but no attempt at chronological arrangement has been made.\r\nAbove the St. John Lateran cloister is an arcade from Gelnhausen in\r\nGermany, a good specimen of grotesque and symbolic sculpture quite in\r\nthe style of the early Lombard work in Northern Italy. The doorway on\r\nthe opposite side of the St. John Lateran cloister is a composition\r\nshowing the general characteristics of the Romanesque style; the doors\r\nare from Hildesheim Cathedral, and were executed in 1015, by order of\r\nBishop Bernwardus. They contain sixteen panels, arranged in proper\r\norder, eight representing scenes in the Old Testament, commencing with\r\nthe creation of man, and eight representing subjects from the New\r\nTestament, beginning with the Annunciation. Next to this, and\r\ncorresponding to the Kilpeck doorway, is a second side door from Shobdon\r\nChurch, Herefordshire. The circles ornamented with foliage over the\r\nShobdon Chancel Arch, are from Moissac. On the side wall next to the\r\nArch, is the monument, from Salisbury Cathedral, of Bishop Roger, who\r\ndied A.D. 1139; it is transitional in style, from the Norman to the\r\nEarly English.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the fountain in this court are placed the celebrated\r\neffigies of Fontevrault Abbey (the burying-place of the Plantagenets),\r\nconsisting of Henry II. and his Queen Eleonora; Richard I.; and\r\nIsabella, wife of King John. These date from the 13th century, and they\r\nare not only interesting as works of art, but valuable as portraits, and\r\nas evidences of costumes of that period. The effigy of Henry II. is the\r\nearliest-known statue of any English king. An effigy of King John from\r\nWorcester, and another of Berengaria, wife of Richard I., from the Abbey\r\nof L’Espan, near Mans, in France, are also to be found here.\r\n\r\nThe inlaid marble pavement of the Court is copied from churches in\r\nFlorence, and is of the beginning of the 13th century.\r\n\r\nHaving thoroughly examined the various contents of this Court, we pass\r\nthrough the opening in the arcade of St. John Lateran, before mentioned,\r\nand enter a vestibule, the vaulting of which is from the convent of the\r\nFranciscans, at Assisi, in Central Italy, with the paintings in the four\r\ncompartments of the vault, from their originals by Cimabue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Door from Birkin Church.]\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this compartment is a large black marble Norman font\r\nfrom Winchester Cathedral: the date of which has given rise to much\r\ncontroversy; those assigned, ranging from 630 to 1150. Next to this font\r\nis another from Eardsley Church, Herefordshire, of the 12th century.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the left, we see on the back wall, looking towards the\r\nGarden, three openings, the central one of which is a doorway from the\r\nchurch of Freshford, in Kilkenny, of about the latter end of the 11th or\r\nbeginning of the 12th century, and on either side of it are windows from\r\nthe church of Tuam, in Ireland. Above the Freshford doorway is a large\r\ncircular window from Rathain Church, remarkable for its great antiquity,\r\nand said to have been erected as early as the middle of the 8th century.\r\nIn this compartment are also placed Irish crosses, affording examples of\r\nthe sculptural antiquities of the Sister Isle; and some interesting\r\ncrosses from the Isle of Man. On the shaft of the Kilcrispeen Cross,\r\nwhich stands in the centre of the gallery, amongst other ornamental\r\npieces of enlacement, will be seen four human figures platted together.\r\nThe influence of Byzantine Art in these Irish antiquities is clearly\r\nmarked. Having examined this compartment, we proceed for a short\r\ndistance southwards, down the corridor or gallery, and pass, on the back\r\nwall of the Byzantine Court, first, a doorway composed principally from\r\nan existing example at Romsey Abbey, the bas-relief in the door-head\r\nbeing from Shobdon: and on the other side of the St. John Lateran\r\narcade, a beautiful Norman doorway from Birkin Church, Yorkshire: after\r\nwhich we reach the smaller division of the Mediæval Court, dedicated to\r\nworks of German Mediæval Art, the entrance to which is beneath the\r\nPointed arcade on our right. Before passing from this Court, the visitor\r\nshould step into the large chamber on the left of the vestibule which\r\ncontains the Irish antiquities of Byzantine art, where he will find an\r\nunique collection of modern ecclesiastical sculpture, consisting of the\r\noriginal models from the study of the late Charles Geerts, the famous\r\nsculptor of Louvain, the originals of which are mostly existing in the\r\nchurches of Belgium, but some are in England. These beautiful and\r\nmasterly productions will repay the careful student of art, as well as\r\nall lovers of the beautiful, for a special inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN MEDIÆVAL COURT.[13]\r\n\r\nThis small Court is devoted exclusively to examples of Gothic art and\r\narchitecture in Germany, and, taken with the English and French Mediæval\r\nCourts,--which we shall presently reach,--gives an excellent idea of the\r\nstyle and character of architecture in these three countries during the\r\nMiddle Ages. Such remarks as are required to explain the transition from\r\nthe Romanesque and Byzantine to the Pointed style of architecture, we\r\nshall defer until we find ourselves in the Mediæval Court of our own\r\ncountry. We, therefore, without preface, conduct the visitor from the\r\ngallery of the Byzantine Court, through the side arches, directly into\r\nthe German Mediæval Court. The large doorway in the centre at once\r\nattracts attention. This is cast from a celebrated church doorway at\r\nNuremberg, and is especially worthy of notice. On the wall to the right\r\nis a doorway leading into the Byzantine Court. This is not copied from\r\nany one particular example, but is a composition displaying the elements\r\nof the German style. The equestrian statue of St. George is from the\r\nCathedral square at Prague, a work of the 14th century. The seven round\r\nbas-reliefs at the top of the doorway, representing scenes from the life\r\nof Christ, are fac-simile copies of the originals by Veit Stoss, at the\r\nChurch of St. Lawrence, in Nuremberg. On either side of this doorway are\r\ntwo monuments, of Bishops Siegfrid von Epstein and Peter Von Aspelt,\r\nopposite to which are the fine monuments of Albert of Saxony, and of\r\nBishop Von Gemmingen; all of these are cast from the originals, in\r\nMayence Cathedral. Above the arches, and all round the Court, is a small\r\narcade, the capitals, brackets, and other monuments of which are taken\r\nfrom various German churches, but more especially from the Cathedral of\r\nCologne. Immediately over the arches through which we have entered, and\r\nbetween the columns of the arcade, are four bosses with the symbols of\r\nthe Evangelists, also from Cologne Cathedral.\r\n\r\n  [13] See “Handbook to the Mediæval Court,” by M. Digby Wyatt and J. B.\r\n  Waring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the German Mediæval Vestibule.]\r\n\r\nPassing through the Nuremberg doorway, in the centre, we see immediately\r\nbefore us, and over the arches leading to the nave, eight dancing\r\nmummers, from the Town-hall at Munich; they are represented as\r\nexhibiting before an audience, probably at some civic festival, and are\r\nfull of grotesque drollery. Beneath the mummers are placed consoles or\r\nbrackets, from the hall of Gurzenich, at Cologne, remarkable for the\r\nhumour displayed in their conception. On the wall to the right are three\r\nlarge reliefs, from the church of St. Sebald, at Nuremberg. They are the\r\nwork of Adam Krafft, and represent:--1. The Betrayal of our Saviour; 2.\r\nThe Mount of Olives; 3. The Last Supper;--and in their execution show\r\ngreat power and much less stiffness than is generally found in Mediæval\r\nworks. Adam Krafft was an excellent sculptor, who flourished at the\r\nclose of the 15th century. His works, which are chiefly to be found at\r\nNuremberg, possess great merit both in their search after truth and the\r\nunusual manual ability they display. Immediately beneath these reliefs\r\nis another by the same artist, taken from the Frauen-Kirche, or Church\r\nof our Lady, at Nuremberg. It represents an Adoration of the Virgin, and\r\nshows even more vigorous handling than the other three. On the other\r\nside of the adjoining doorway, from the Monastery of Denkendorf, in\r\nWurtemburgh, is another piece, representing the “Coronation of the\r\nVirgin,” also by Krafft. The monument beneath is from Munich, and is of\r\nthe 16th century. On the left-hand wall, next to the Nuremberg door, is\r\na bas-relief of “Justice with the Rich and Poor,” by Veit Stoss, from\r\nthe Town-hall at Nuremberg. Above and below this are others by Krafft.\r\nThe upper, the “Meeting of Christ and St. Veronica,” from the Via\r\nCrucis, Nuremberg; the lower, another “Coronation of the Virgin,” from\r\nthe Frauen-Kirche, Nuremberg. Under this last are two ascribed to Albert\r\nDurer--a “Circumcision,” and “Christ teaching in the Temple;” and on the\r\nother side of the doorway, leading into the English Mediæval Court, is\r\nthe celebrated garland representing the triumph of the Church, by Veit\r\nStoss, from the church of St. Lawrence, at Nuremberg, which deserves\r\nespecial examination as one of the master-pieces of that sculptor, and\r\non account of its very peculiar arrangement. Other subjects in this\r\nCourt present excellent examples of German Mediæval Art down to the time\r\nof Peter Vischer, whose works evince an evident influence derived from\r\nthe Renaissance School of Italy, at the close of the 15th and at the\r\ncommencement of the 16th centuries.\r\n\r\nWe now emerge into the Nave, and turning to the left, find ourselves in\r\nfront of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH MEDIÆVAL COURT.[14]\r\n\r\nIt will have been remarked in the German Mediæval Court, that\r\narchitecture has undergone another change. No sooner had the Lombard or\r\nRomanesque style become systematised, than features arose which\r\ncontained the germs of yet more important changes.\r\n\r\n  [14] See “Handbook to the Mediæval Court,” by M. Digby Wyatt and J. B.\r\n  Waring.\r\n\r\nThe Horizontal line principle of antique Art was gradually given up, and\r\na marked inclination towards the Vertical line principle took its\r\nplace. The full change was not yet by any means complete, and it\r\nremained for the introduction of the Pointed arch, under Norman\r\ninfluence in England and France, in the 12th century, to effect a\r\ngradual revolution in the whole system of construction and\r\nornamentation, until nearly every trace of the preceding style was lost,\r\nand another essentially distinct in all its characteristics arose in its\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to English Mediæval Court.]\r\n\r\nAs we are now standing before the ecclesiastical architecture of our own\r\ncountry, it may be interesting to notice briefly, and in chronological\r\norder, the progress of Pointed architecture in England, and to specify a\r\nfew of those leading features which serve to distinguish the style of\r\none period from that of another.\r\n\r\nPrior to our doing this, it will be well briefly to notice the Norman\r\nstyle which preceded the Pointed, and which was extensively practised by\r\nthe Normans and English in this country, after the successful invasion\r\nby William in 1066. Its leading features are extreme solidity, absence\r\nof ornament (at its earliest period), semicircular or horse-shoe arches,\r\nand the peculiar zigzag mouldings before noted. The buttresses or\r\nsupports placed against walls to give them strength are broad, but\r\nproject very little. The pillars are short, massive, and frequently\r\ncircular, whilst the capitals are usually cubical and channeled in a\r\npeculiar manner, sometimes being quite plain, and at others carved with\r\ngrotesque and symbolic figures and foliage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side niche of Tintern door.]\r\n\r\nThe Norman lasted until the 13th century, when it made way for the first\r\npointed style, which is known as _Early English_. The arches in this\r\nstyle are lancet-shaped; the pillars consist frequently of small shafts\r\nclustering round a circular pier, and are much slighter and taller than\r\nthe Norman: the capitals are frequently without ornament, being simply\r\nplain mouldings. When the capital is carved with foliage, the work is\r\nboldly executed. Spires, too, although originating in the later Norman,\r\nrose in the Early English high into the air, like landmarks to the\r\npeople, to point out where they might congregate to worship their Divine\r\nCreator. The buttresses are bold, generally rising in diminishing\r\nstages, and either terminating in a triangular head or sloping off into\r\nthe wall. Windows, two or three in number, were often grouped together\r\nunder a moulded arch, between the point of which and the tops of the\r\nwindows an intervening space was formed. This space, pierced with one or\r\nmore openings, gave rise to that most distinctive and beautiful element\r\nof the Gothic style--TRACERY.\r\n\r\nThe _Decorated_ style, which succeeded to the Early English, flourished\r\nduring the 14th century, and the Court we are now about to enter\r\npossesses numerous examples of this, the best and brightest period of\r\nEnglish Gothic; for in the Early English the style had not yet reached\r\nits highest point of beauty, and in the later _Perpendicular_ it already\r\nsuffered decline. Tracery, as we have stated, was the chief\r\ncharacteristic of the Decorated style; and it consists either of\r\ngeometrical forms or of flowing lines. As an example of the former, the\r\nvisitor may examine the arches of the cloister, containing the two\r\nfigures now before us, on the side niche of the Tintern door. The\r\nfoliated details and carvings, which also give character to this style,\r\nmay, in like manner, be studied with advantage in this Court. The\r\npillars are either clustered or single, and generally of octangular or\r\ncircular form; the capitals are sometimes carved with foliage, at other\r\ntimes they are plain. The buttress is in stages and terminated\r\noccasionally with Decorated pinnacles. The execution of the details of\r\nthis style was admirable, and the variety and beauty of the ornaments,\r\nfounded chiefly on natural subjects, gives to the _Decorated_ style an\r\neffect which has seldom, if ever, been surpassed.\r\n\r\nFrom the latter part of the 14th to the beginning of the 16th century\r\nthe _Perpendicular_ style was in vogue. It derives its name from the\r\ntracery, which, instead of taking flowing forms, consists chiefly of\r\nvertical lines. The arches became depressed in form, the Tudor arch\r\nbeing distinctive of its later phase, whilst the ornaments were crowded,\r\nand departed more from natural models. The more important buildings were\r\ncovered throughout with shallow panelled work and profuse ornament, over\r\nwhich the eye wanders in vain for much-needed repose, and the effect of\r\nbreadth and grandeur of parts is lost and frittered away.\r\n\r\nThese few observations, imperfect as they are, may perhaps assist the\r\nvisitor’s appreciation of the Court we are about to examine. Without\r\nfurther preface, then, we proceed through the archway, as usual, from\r\nthe Nave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arcade from Guisborough.]\r\n\r\nWe are in a cloister of the _Decorated_ period, founded in its arches\r\nand columns on the Abbey of Guisborough, Yorkshire. Looking through the\r\ncloister to the left, we see before us a doorway from the Chapel of\r\nPrince Arthur, son of Henry VII., in Worcester Cathedral, which will\r\nenable us to test in a measure the truth of our summary of the\r\nPerpendicular style. On the extreme right we see the door of Bishop\r\nWest’s Chapel, from Ely, a capital example of the Later Perpendicular\r\nstyle as it began to feel the influence of the coming Renaissance\r\nperiod. Crossing the cloister we enter the Mediæval Court, which\r\ncontains architectural specimens taken from our ancient churches and\r\nmagnificent cathedrals.\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the Court is formed of arches, containing, in the\r\nspandrels, figures of angels illustrative of the gradual unfolding of\r\nDivine revelation, taken from the “Angels’ Choir,” in Lincoln Cathedral.\r\nThe sculptures in the tympanum are mostly from Tewkesbury, and the\r\nfigures under the canopies are from Wells Cathedral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan of English Mediæval Court.]\r\n\r\nEntering the Court from the Nave, we find, immediately facing us, the\r\nmagnificent doorway from Rochester Cathedral, coloured so as to give an\r\nidea of its appearance when first erected. The different faces, “making\r\nmouths,” introduced amongst the tracery of this door, afford a good\r\nexample of the grotesque spirit which forms so strong an element of\r\nGothic architecture. We may remark here that the practice of colouring\r\nand gilding was carried to an almost extravagant extent in the Gothic\r\nstyle, although the effacing hand of Time has left comparatively few\r\nexamples in a perfect state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Doorway from Rochester Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nOn the left of the door is a portion of the arcading from the Chapter\r\nHouse of Wells Cathedral, and next is the richly-decorated Easter\r\nsepulchre, from Hawton Church, Nottinghamshire, representing the\r\nResurrection and Ascension of Christ,--a very remarkable monument of the\r\n14th century. At the foot are the soldiers on guard at the Sepulchre,\r\nsleeping, and in the centre (the altar-table) the Resurrection of our\r\nLord, bearing his cross; the three Marys in adoration at his feet. Above\r\nis the Ascension, the Apostles standing around. This last subject is\r\ntreated in an original and ingenious manner, to come within the lines of\r\nthe architecture. This monument was used as an altar; various rites\r\nbeing performed before it, between Good-Friday and Easter-day. A seated\r\nfigure, from the front of Lincoln Cathedral, is the next subject; and\r\nfurther on, in the angle, is a Virgin and Child, in a niche,--a\r\nbeautiful piece of early 14th century work from York Minster; and next\r\nis a portion of Bishop Alcock’s chantry chapel, from Ely Cathedral; on\r\nthe other side of the adjoining doorway, which is a composition chiefly\r\nfrom the triforium of Lincoln Cathedral, we remark the very beautiful\r\noriel window of John o’Gaunt, at Lincoln, and next to it a portion of\r\nthe elaborate altar-screen of Winchester Cathedral.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the Rochester door is the finely designed monument of\r\nHumphrey de Bohun, from Hereford Cathedral, with the effigy of the\r\nknight in complete armour. Next to this, in the angle, we see the\r\nrecumbent figure of the “Boy Bishop” from Salisbury Cathedral. It used\r\nto be the custom in the Catholic Church, annually to elect a bishop from\r\nthe children of the choir, who, throughout the year, kept all the state\r\nof a regular bishop; and, in the event of his dying within the period of\r\nhis office, had his effigy erected as here we see. For further\r\nparticulars of this singular custom, see the “Handbook of the Mediæval\r\nCourt.” The door beyond corresponds to the one opposite; and further on,\r\nnear the cloister, is one of the doors of Lichfield Cathedral, with its\r\nbeautiful ironwork, the painting of which, to represent oak, is\r\nremarkably clever; and a portion of Bishop Bubwith’s monument from\r\nWells. The exquisite niches and canopies round the walls of the court\r\nare from Southwell Minster, Ely Cathedral, Beverley Minster, &c. The\r\nstatues on a line with, and corresponding to those on the monument of\r\nBishop Bubwith, are excellent examples of late Gothic work, from Armagh\r\nCathedral. The upper tier, consisting principally of sculpture, presents\r\nvaluable examples of that art. The large statues beneath the canopies\r\nare from the façade of Wells; they are all of the highest interest with\r\nreference to the history of sculpture in England. The floor presents a\r\nremarkable and interesting series of the best sepulchral monuments of\r\nthe Gothic period which England possesses, viz., those of Queen Eleanor,\r\nfrom Westminster; Edward II., from Gloucester; the celebrated monument\r\nof William of Wykeham, from Winchester; and that of Edward the Black\r\nPrince, in gilt armour and emblazoned surcoat, from Canterbury\r\nCathedral. The individuality observable in most of the faces indicates\r\nthat they are portraits. The very lovely face of the good Queen Eleanor\r\nshould not escape the notice of the visitor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elevation of English Mediæval Court towards the\r\ncloister.]\r\n\r\nIndeed all the subjects in this Court are full of value and interest,\r\nand the numerous examples of Gothic art here collected, which we have\r\nnot space to describe in detail, form a museum in which the visitor may\r\nobtain no inadequate idea of the rich treasures in this wise of our\r\ncountry. Passing beneath the Rochester doorway, we enter a vaulted and\r\ngroined vestibule, the window of which is a beautiful example of the\r\nDecorated style, from Holbeach, in Lincolnshire, filled in with rich\r\nstained glass. Beneath the window is the painted monument of John of\r\nEltham, son of Edward II., from Westminster Abbey, on either side\r\nstatues from Wells Cathedral. In the centre is the very richly-decorated\r\nfont, from Walsingham, in Norfolk, an excellent example of the\r\nPerpendicular style. The walls of the gallery are lined with statues and\r\nmonuments; those on the Garden side are all English, principally from\r\nthe façade of Wells Cathedral; those on the side of the Court are\r\nchiefly from Germany and France. Amongst the latter, we draw particular\r\nattention to the bas-reliefs on the walls, from Notre-Dame, Paris, as\r\nexcellent examples of early French Gothic. Amongst the central monuments\r\nshould be particularly remarked, behind the German Mediæval Court, the\r\nArderne tomb, from Elford church, Staffordshire; the monument of Henry\r\nIV., and Joan of Navarre (his queen), from Canterbury Cathedral; the\r\ntombs of Sir Giles Daubeny, Richard II., and Anne of Bohemia (his\r\nqueen), from Westminster Abbey, of about the year 1507; and behind the\r\nFrench and Italian Mediæval Court, the splendid monument of Richard\r\nBeauchamp, Earl of Warwick, from Warwick, one of the finest Gothic\r\nsepulchral monuments remaining in England. Passing beneath the arcade,\r\nnear the Beauchamp monument, we enter the next architectural\r\nillustration of the series.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH AND ITALIAN MEDIÆVAL COURT,[15]\r\n\r\nOn the walls of which, on the ground row, are ranged a series of arches\r\nfrom the choir of Notre-Dame, at Paris, the greater number of the\r\ncanopies which surmount them being taken from the Cathedral of Chartres,\r\nboth fine examples of early French Gothic art. The very excellent\r\nstatues, bosses, &c., are from various French churches. The statue on\r\nthe floor is by the great Italian sculptor, Giovanni Pisano (13th\r\ncentury), and serves as a lectern, or reading-stand. The subject towards\r\nthe nave is composed of portions of the celebrated altar-piece of Or San\r\nMichele, at Florence, by Andrea Orgagna (14th century). One of the two\r\nstatues nearest the gallery is by Nino Pisano, son of Giovanni. The very\r\nelaborate example of iron-work near the nave entrance is from one of the\r\ngreat west doors of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Paris, and evinces such\r\nconsummate skill in workmanship as to have obtained for its artist, when\r\nfirst made public, the unenviable credit of being in close league with\r\nthe Evil One. The exact date of this iron-work is not ascertained, but\r\nit is of the best period of the French Pointed style.\r\n\r\n  [15] See “Handbook to the Mediæval Court,” by M. Digby Wyatt and J. B.\r\n  Waring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the French and Italian Mediæval Vestibule.]\r\n\r\nOnce more regaining the Nave, we proceed on our journey southward, until\r\na few steps bring us to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RENAISSANCE COURT.[16]\r\n\r\nMan had wrought for centuries patiently and laboriously at Gothic\r\narchitecture, and had advanced, by regular stages, to the perfection of\r\nthat style, which, after reaching its zenith in the 14th century, as\r\nregularly and decidedly declined in excellence, until the indispensable\r\nprinciples of true art--simplicity and good taste--were, towards the\r\nclose of the 15th century, overwhelmed by excess of ornament. Whilst\r\nthis downward road was followed by most European artists, various causes\r\nled to the revival of the Antique in Italy, and at the commencement of\r\nthe 15th century, the celebrated Brunelleschi produced a work founded on\r\nthe Antique Roman style, of the highest merit, viz., the Dome of\r\nFlorence Cathedral. In the year 1420, Ghiberti executed his wonderful\r\nbronze doors; and from thenceforward the new style of the revived art,\r\nor the Renaissance, as it is now usually called, advanced rapidly, first\r\nthroughout Italy, and, in the succeeding century, throughout Europe.\r\nAmongst the causes which led to this revival may be included the decline\r\nof the feudal system, the growing freedom of thought, the recent\r\ndiscoveries of the New World, and of the art of Printing. With the rise\r\nof the spirit of personal independence was created a thirst for ancient\r\nliterature and art; and a search for the hidden fountains of antiquity\r\nwas enthusiastically persevered in, until in the end it proved eminently\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n  [16] See “Handbook to the Renaissance Court,” by M. Digby Wyatt and J.\r\n  B. Waring.\r\n\r\nMonastic libraries, in obedience to the demands of the public voice,\r\nyielded up their treasures of ancient literature, whilst the soil of\r\nItaly was made to disgorge its mutilated fragments of antique art. The\r\neffects of these sudden, unexpected, and precious acquisitions may\r\nreadily be imagined; they created a complete revolution in literature\r\nand art throughout Italy, which spread thence into other countries. The\r\ntwo beautiful arts of Painting and Sculpture saw with emulative shame\r\ntheir present inferiority in the ranks of Art; and in their noble\r\naspirations towards the perfection newly placed before them, they\r\nassumed their position as distinct and legitimate creations. But if the\r\nGothic system was now dying out, it had left at least one valuable\r\nlegacy to the future, in its appreciation and adoption of natural\r\nmodels. The Italian artists of the 15th century received the gift\r\njoyfully, and, combining it with what treasures antiquity afforded\r\nthem, produced a style which, in sculpture especially, has all the\r\nfreshness of nature and the refinement of the antique, as both were\r\ncapable of being united by the gifted men whose names have come down in\r\nglory to our own day, and will command the admiration of the latest\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to Renaissance Court.]\r\n\r\nOn no branch of art did the revival of the antique more strongly act\r\nthan on the art of architecture; the Gothic style, which had never taken\r\ndeep root in the soil of classic Italy, speedily fell altogether in\r\nthat country before the recent discovery and imitation of the Roman\r\nantiquities. No powerful body of Freemasons was there, as in England,\r\nFrance, and Germany, to oppose the progress of the new style; and the\r\nindividual energy of such men as Brunelleschi, Bramante, and the great\r\narchitects of the northern states, soon established it on an\r\nindestructible basis. And, however much a partisan spirit may decry this\r\nor that particular style, the productions influenced by the revival of\r\nthe antique, throughout the 15th century, especially in architecture and\r\nsculpture, will never fail to excite our astonishment and emulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arcade of Hôtel Bourgtheroulde at Rouen.]\r\n\r\nThe façade before us is a restored copy of a portion of the Hôtel\r\nBourgtheroulde, at Rouen. It was built at the end of the 15th and the\r\nbeginning of the 16th centuries. The bas-relief before us represents the\r\nField of the Cloth of Gold, and the memorable meeting (in 1520) of\r\nFrancis I. of France and our own Henry VIII. The frieze above, by\r\nmembers of the “della Robbia” family, is from the Hospital of the Poor,\r\nat Pistoia, in Tuscany, and shows monks or priests relieving the poor;\r\nthe original is in coloured porcelain. Entering the court, we find in\r\nthe lunettes under the ceiling of the small loggia, or gallery,\r\nportraits of twelve of the most celebrated patrons of art in the\r\nRenaissance period of Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, containing in\r\nthe central compartment Francis I. of France and Catherine de’ Medici,\r\nin the compartment to the right, Lorenzo de’ Medici and Lucrezia Borgia,\r\nand in that to the left, Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian of Germany. In\r\nthe centre of the court we find a fountain of the Renaissance period,\r\nfrom the Château de Gaillon, in France; and on either side of the\r\nfountain are two bronze wells, from the Ducal Palace at Venice, the one\r\nto the right surmounted by a statue from the goose-market, Nuremberg,\r\nthat to the left by the figure of a Cupid, with a dolphin, from\r\nFlorence. Both these wells have been arranged as fountain basins.\r\nDirecting our steps to the right, we may first examine the decorations\r\non the lower part of the interior of the façade, the bas-relief of which\r\nis taken from the high altar at Granada Cathedral, in Spain. The statue\r\nin the centre is that of the wife of Louis de Poncher, the original of\r\nwhich is now in the Louvre; its date may be assigned to the early\r\nportion of the 16th century. The altar on which the statue is placed is\r\nfrom the Certosa, near Pavia, in Northern Italy. The first object on the\r\nside wall is a door, by Jean Goujon (a French sculptor who executed many\r\nworks at the Louvre), from the Church of Saint Maclou, at Rouen; then a\r\ndoorway from the Doria Palace at Genoa, a fine specimen of the\r\ncinque-cento; above this are five bas-reliefs from the museum at\r\nFlorence, representing Faith, Prayer, Wisdom, Justice, and Charity; and\r\nbeyond it, one of the most beautiful objects in the Palace, a copy of\r\nthe far-famed gates from the Baptistery at Florence, executed by Lorenzo\r\nGhiberti, who was occupied upon his work for the space of twenty-one\r\nyears. One glance is sufficient to assure the spectator that sculpture\r\nhad indeed advanced to an extraordinary degree of excellence at the\r\nperiod which we have now reached. The visitor having sufficiently\r\nadmired these “Gates of Paradise,” as Michael Angelo termed them, will\r\nproceed on his way, passing another doorway, which, like that on the\r\nother side, already seen, is from Genoa. Close to it is a door by\r\nGoujon, corresponding to the door in the opposite corner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Renaissance Court.]\r\n\r\nOn the back wall we first notice a composition made up from various\r\nexamples of cinque-cento work from the Certosa at Pavia. Adjoining it is\r\na portion of an altar also from the same Certosa--a beautiful specimen\r\nof sculptural art of the time. Next to this is another piece of\r\ncinque-cento composition, from specimens obtained from this prolific\r\nsource, Milan, &c. The sculptured figures of angels, and other figures\r\nin high and low relief in this composition, are worthy of a careful\r\nstudy. In the centre, two colossal figures (Caryatides), from the\r\nLouvre, by Jean Goujon, support a large cast of the Nymph of\r\nFontainebleau, executed for Francis I., by the celebrated Benvenuto\r\nCellini. Next to the Caryatides we see an exquisite specimen of a\r\nportion of the interior of the principal entrance to the Certosa most\r\nelaborately carved, and the panels filled in with bas-reliefs; the\r\ndoorway by its side is from the Hôtel de Ville, of Oudenarde, in\r\nBelgium. Above is a composition of French Renaissance art. It stands out\r\nfrom the wall, and looks very like an antique cabinet or screen. Another\r\narchitectural example from the Certosa follows, being a sort of military\r\nmonument erected to the memory of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan;\r\nthe date of its execution is the end of the 15th century. Within it are\r\nbas-reliefs by Luca della Robbia and Donatello. On the side next the\r\nFrench Mediæval Court is first another oak door from Saint Maclou, by\r\nJean Goujon, and then a doorway from Genoa; and, above it, the frieze of\r\n“The Singers,” by Luca della Robbia, the original of which is at\r\nFlorence, a most charming work, fall of life and animation. In the\r\ncentre of this--the northern--side of the court, is a cast from one of\r\nthe windows of the façade of the Certosa, a remarkably fine example of\r\ncinque-cento; next to it, another doorway, from the Doria Palace at\r\nGenoa; and in the corner a fourth door from Saint Maclou, by Goujon, the\r\ncentral bas-relief of which represents the Baptism of Christ. The lower\r\npart of the interior of the façade is devoted to examples of Italian\r\nsculpture of the 15th century, including a head of St. John by\r\nDonatello.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan of Elizabethan Court.]\r\n\r\nThe monument placed against the wall is that of Ilaria di Caretto, from\r\nLucca Cathedral, executed by Jacopo della Quercia, of Sienna, early in\r\nthe 15th century: it is a very fine example of the cinque-cento style.\r\n\r\nTwo statues by Donatello cannot fail to be noticed--his Saint John in\r\nmarble, and David in bronze, both of which display great power and study\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nWe now pass out through the doorway under the Nymph of Fontainebleau,\r\nand enter a vestibule in the Renaissance style. Here, on the ceiling, is\r\na copy of a painting from the Sala del Cambio (Exchange) at Perugia, in\r\nItaly, by Perugino, the master of Raffaelle, who assisted Perugino in\r\nthe work. The painting represents the Seven Planets, with Apollo in the\r\ncentre, as the personification of the Sun. The wall of the Renaissance\r\nCourt to the left of the entrance is decorated with arches, and a frieze\r\nfrom the terra-cotta originals in the Certosa; the singing boys in the\r\nfrieze are of great merit. The bronze monument in the centre of this\r\nwall is that of Lewis of Bavaria, a very interesting example of late\r\nGerman Gothic, remarkable for the finish of its details. In the centre\r\nof the gallery are placed Germain Pilon’s “Graces,” a charming example\r\nof the French school of sculpture. The four angles under the Perugia\r\nceiling are occupied by four statues, also by Pilon; these statues are\r\nall now in the Louvre, and the very remarkable bronze monumental effigy\r\nin the centre, against the garden, is from the Museum at Florence; it is\r\nascribed to Vecchietta of Sienna. On either side of the doorway are\r\nparts of Goujon’s doors from St. Maclou, at Rouen.\r\n\r\nOn the back wall, to the right of the doorway, are richly ornamented\r\narches, from the large cloisters in terra-cotta of the Certosa, and also\r\nbas-reliefs and specimens of the Renaissance style from various parts of\r\nItaly. The central monument of Bernard von Gablenz is an exceedingly\r\nfine example of the style as practised in Germany, at the close of the\r\n16th century. After examining these objects, we turn into the narrow\r\ncourt adjoining the Renaissance Court, and find ourselves in\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELIZABETHAN COURT.\r\n\r\nThe architectural details in this Court are taken from Holland House, at\r\nKensington, a fine old mansion made interesting to us by many\r\nassociations. Elizabethan architecture, which was in its flower during\r\nthe latter half of the 16th century--more than a hundred years after the\r\nrevival of classical architecture in Italy--shows the first symptoms of\r\nthe adoption of the new style in England. The Elizabethan style--the\r\nname reaches back over the century--is characterised by much-pierced\r\nstonework, rectangular ornamentation, and a rough imitation of antique\r\ndetail applied to masses of building, in which many Gothic features were\r\nstill retained as regards general form, but altered as to ornament. The\r\nstyle being in its very nature transitory, it gradually gave way,\r\nalthough characterised by a certain palatial grandeur and striking\r\npicturesqueness, before the increasing knowledge which England obtained\r\nof Italian architecture, until we find it entirely displaced in the\r\nfirst half of the 17th century by the excellent style of building\r\nintroduced by Inigo Jones. We must add, that, although it has no\r\npretensions to the character of a regular or complete system, yet few\r\nwho have visited the great Elizabethan mansions scattered over England\r\ncan have failed to admire their picturesque and solid appearance, their\r\nstately halls, corridors, staircases, and chimney-pieces, and the\r\nbeautiful garden terraces, which form so important a feature in their\r\ngeneral design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Façade from Elizabethan Court.]\r\n\r\nThe kneeling effigies in the gallery at the back of this court are from\r\nthe Hertford monument in Salisbury Cathedral, and represent the sons of\r\nthe Countess of Norfolk, who lay on either side of her. The Court\r\ncontains several tombs of the period. The first is that of Sir John\r\nCheney, from Salisbury Cathedral: a soldier who distinguished himself in\r\nthe wars of the Roses, and was attached to the party of Henry VII. The\r\noriginal effigy is in alabaster, a material much used during the early\r\npart of the 16th century. The next monument is that of Mary Queen of\r\nScots from Westminster Abbey, executed in the beginning of the 17th\r\ncentury, and displaying in its treatment all the characteristics of the\r\nElizabethan style. Under the arch in the centre is the bust of\r\nShakspeare, from his monument in Stratford-on-Avon Church. The\r\nsucceeding monument is that of Queen Elizabeth, also from Westminster,\r\nconstructed at about the same period as that of Queen Mary; the original\r\neffigy is of white marble. The last monument is that of Margaret,\r\nCountess of Richmond and Derby (the mother of Henry VII.), at\r\nWestminster. It is the work of the Florentine sculptor Torrigiano; the\r\noriginal is in copper, and its date the early part of the 16th century;\r\nit is of unusual merit. Advancing a few paces, the visitor again reaches\r\nthe Nave, and turning still southward, finds himself before\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN COURT,[17]\r\n\r\nWhich, as will be at once remarked, closely resembles the style of\r\nantique Roman art, on which, indeed, the modern is professedly founded.\r\nAlthough Brunelleschi, as we have before observed, revived the practice\r\nof antique architecture as early as the year 1420, yet various causes\r\ncombined to delay a thorough investigation of the antique remains until\r\nthe close of the century; and it even is not until the commencement of\r\nthe 16th century that we find the Italian style, or modernised Roman,\r\nregularly systematised and generally received throughout Italy; from\r\nwhence it gradually extended, first to Spain and to France, and at a\r\nsomewhat later period into England and Germany. The power and excellence\r\nof the style are nobly exhibited in a large number of buildings, amongst\r\nwhich may be noted the ancient Library at Venice; St. Peter’s, at Rome;\r\nthe Pitti Palace, Florence; the Basilica of Vicenza, the great Colonnade\r\nof the Louvre, Paris; St. Paul’s Cathedral, London; and the Escurial\r\nPalace, near Madrid.\r\n\r\n  [17] See “Handbook to the Italian Court,” by M. Digby Wyatt and J. B.\r\n  Waring.\r\n\r\nIn this style, architecture rests chiefly on its own intrinsic\r\nexcellence, or on proportion, symmetry, and good taste. The arts of\r\nsculpture and painting, in a great measure, become independent of\r\narchitecture; and their absence in buildings of a later period (the 17th\r\nand 18th centuries, for instance) led to a coldness of character, which\r\nhappily promises at the present day to find its remedy.\r\n\r\nThe Court before which we stand is founded on a portion of the finest\r\npalatial edifice in Rome,--the Farnese Palace, commenced by the\r\narchitect Antonio Sangallo, for Cardinal Farnese, and finished under the\r\ndirection of Michael Angelo. A curious fact in connexion with the\r\noriginal building is, that the stones which compose it were taken from\r\nthe ancient Coliseum, within whose mighty walls the early Christians\r\nsuffered martyrdom; so that, in truth, the same stones which bore\r\nwitness to the faith and courage of the early devotees, served\r\nafterwards to build for the faith triumphant a palace in which luxury,\r\nworldliness, and pride found a genial home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan of Italian Court.]\r\n\r\nPrior to entering the Court, we may remark, in the niches, the bronze\r\nstatues by Sansovino, from the Campanile Loggia at Venice, amongst which\r\nApollo is conceived quite in the old Roman spirit. Passing beneath, the\r\ncolumns in the centre of the court, we see the fountain of the\r\nTartarughe, or “of the Tortoises,” at Rome, designed by Giacomo della\r\nPorta: the copies of the bronze statues by Taddeo Landini belonging to\r\nit are, for the present, placed in front of the Vestibule of the Italian\r\nCourt. Turning to the right, the first object that attracts our\r\nattention is a statue of the Virgin and Child, by Michael Angelo, the\r\noriginal of which is in the Church of Lorenzo, Florence. Advancing to\r\nthe south side, we enter a loggia or arcade, the interior of which is\r\nrichly ornamented with copies of Raffaelle’s celebrated frescoes in the\r\nLoggie of the Vatican palace at Rome. They consist of a most fanciful,\r\nyet tasteful, combination of landscape figures, architecture and\r\nfoliage, founded on antique models, and bearing a close resemblance to\r\nthe ornamental work discovered in various Roman ruins, having been\r\nimitated by Raffaelle from the baths of Titus, discovered about this\r\ntime. The towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which have so much enlarged\r\nour knowledge of ancient arabesque ornament, were at that time unknown.\r\nIn the centre of the arcade, towards the Court, is the monument of\r\nGiuliano de’ Medici, from San Lorenzo, Florence. On each side of his\r\nstatue are the reclining figures Night and Day (part of the same\r\nmonument). The face of the right-hand figure is left rough-hewn by the\r\npoet-sculptor to indicate the indistinct aspect of Night. The face of\r\nTwilight, on the opposite monument, though still in the rough, is more\r\nclearly expressed, as it should be. This is one of Michael Angelo’s\r\nmasterpieces, and is remarkably characteristic of the sculptor’s style.\r\nAt the back of it, in the Loggia, is a fine specimen of bronze casting,\r\nfrom the gates of the enclosure at the foot of the Campanile, Venice. On\r\neach side of the entrance to the gallery are two groups of a Virgin with\r\nthe dead Christ, that to the right being by Bernini, the other to the\r\nleft by Michael Angelo, both especially interesting as serving to\r\nindicate the state of art in the 16th and 17th centuries respectively.\r\nThe remaining statues, viz.,--the Slave, now in the Louvre, the Christ\r\nin the Church of S. Maria Minerva, Rome, and the Pietà in St. Peter’s,\r\nRome, are by Michael Angelo. The visitor may now enter the loggia,\r\nwhich, like its companion on the other side of the Court, is ornamented\r\nwith copies of Raffaelle’s frescoes from the Vatican; in the centre of\r\nthis side of the Court is placed Michael Angelo’s celebrated monument of\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, from the church of San Lorenzo at Florence; the\r\nreclining figures on each side of the statue of Lorenzo represent Dawn\r\nand Twilight. At the back of this monument within the arcade is the fine\r\nbronze door by Sansovino from St. Mark’s, Venice, on which he is said to\r\nhave laboured from twenty to thirty years. The projecting heads are\r\nsupposed to be portraits; amongst them are those of Titian, Aretino, and\r\nof the sculptor himself. Proceeding onwards, the beautiful composition\r\nof Jonah and the Whale, by Raffaelle, is from the Chigi Chapel at Rome.\r\nPassing into the gallery on the Garden side, we remark in the four\r\nangles portions of the pedestals of the Venetian standards, from the\r\nPiazza of St. Mark, Venice. The painted ceilings of this gallery deserve\r\nspecial attention. The first on entering the gallery is from an existing\r\nexample at the “Old Library,” Venice; the last is from the “Camera della\r\nSegnatura,” by Raffaelle, at the Vatican; beneath which is the wonderful\r\nstatue of Moses, by Michael Angelo,--a production the grandeur of which\r\namounts to sublimity, expressing in every line, with, the noblest\r\nconception, the inspired lawgiver and appointed leader of a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESTIBULE TO THE ITALIAN COURT.[18]\r\n\r\nThe decoration of the vestibule is founded on the very elegant Casa\r\nTaverna at Milan, by Bernardino Luini, a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci, and\r\naffords an excellent idea of the peculiar painted mural ornament\r\nprevailing in Italy at the commencement of the 16th century. The doors\r\nare from the Palace of the Cancellaria at Rome, by Bramante, the famous\r\ndesigner of St. Peter’s in that city, and the immediate predecessor of\r\nthe great architects of the 16th century. The vestibule itself is rich\r\nin very beautiful water-colour drawings after the old masters, by Mr.\r\nWest. These drawings are well worthy of study, since they afford\r\nadmirable specimens of the manner of many old masters, who are but\r\npoorly represented in the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n  [18] See “Handbook to the Italian Court,” by M. Digby Wyatt and J. B.\r\n  Waring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monument of Lancino Curzio.\r\n\r\nMadonna della Scarpa.\r\n\r\nSacrarium of the Maddelena from Certosa.\r\n\r\nGround Plan of Italian Vestibule.]\r\n\r\nWe now pass out of the gallery into the Vestibule, by turning through\r\nthe pillars to the right. The monuments on the external wall of the\r\nvestibule afford excellent examples of the later Renaissance style.\r\nAmongst them may be particularly noted the monument of Lancino Curzio\r\n(nearest the gallery), from Milan, by Agostino Busti, evincing that\r\ndelicate execution for which the sculptor was famous; underneath is the\r\ntomb of St. Pelagius Martyr, from Genoa; and, in the centre of the wall,\r\nthe central altar of La Madonna della Scarpa, from the Leno Chapel in\r\nthe Cathedral of St. Mark, Venice--an elaborate specimen of bronze\r\ncasting, completed early in the 16th century by Pietro Lombardo and\r\nothers. The upper part of the monument nearest the Nave is an excellent\r\nexample of the Renaissance style, being the Sacrarium of the Chapel of\r\nthe Maddelena at the Certosa, Pavia; the bas-relief in the centre is by\r\nDonatello, and the remaining portions of the composition are from\r\nSansovino.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Façade of Italian Vestibule.]\r\n\r\nWe have now completed our survey of one of the most interesting features\r\nof the Crystal Palace. We have performed our promise to guide the\r\nvisitor through the various Fine Art Courts, bringing before his notice\r\nsome of the principal objects that have adorned his road, and\r\nendeavouring, by our brief remarks, to heighten the pleasure he must\r\nnecessarily have experienced from the sight of so noble an assemblage of\r\narchitectural and sculptural examples. Much however requires patient\r\nexamination and study--examination that will yield fresh beauty, and\r\nstudy that will be rewarded by permanent and useful knowledge. For\r\nguidance and help we refer the visitor to the handbooks of the several\r\nCourts. The mission of this little work, as far as the Fine Art Courts\r\nare concerned, is accomplished: and “THE GUIDE BOOK” now only waits\r\nuntil the visitor has sufficiently recovered from his fatigue, in order\r\nto resume, in other parts of the building, the part of cicerone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT OF MONUMENTS OF ART.\r\n\r\nWe enter this Court (which is formed in one angle of the Great Transept\r\nwith the Nave), as with the other Courts, from the Nave. The first\r\nobjects that attract our notice are some beautiful statues of the\r\nItalian school, amongst which will be found many of Canova’s, several\r\nbeautiful works by Richard Wyatt, and some from the chisel of Gibson.\r\nThe statues at the garden end of the Court are mostly French. Some of\r\nthe most conspicuous objects however in the Court are the very\r\ninteresting crosses of the early Irish Church, and the richly sculptured\r\nbronze column from Hildesheim Cathedral in Germany, a fine example of\r\nthe Byzantine period. Also a very interesting cross, from Pocklington,\r\nin Yorkshire,--a fine example of the monumental art of the latter part\r\nof the 15th century. This specimen has been liberally presented by\r\nSamuel Leigh Sotheby, Esq.\r\n\r\nBeyond these are monuments of the Gothic period, amongst which are\r\nconspicuous the Cantilupe shrine from Hereford Cathedral, and the effigy\r\nof Edward III., from Westminster; the central tombs, of Bishop Wakeman,\r\nfrom Tewkesbury, and of Bishop Bridport, from Salisbury (the last-named\r\nbeing that to the left).\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Henry VII., an interesting example of the Italian\r\nRenaissance style in England, at an early period of its introduction,\r\nand the fine bronze monument of Cardinal Zeno from Venice, occupy the\r\nfurther end; and the equestrian statue of Gattamelata, by Donatello,\r\nforms a conspicuous feature in this portion of the Court, where also is\r\na fine bust of Cosmo de’ Medici, by Benvenuto Cellini. Under the gallery\r\nat the further end are two fine equestrian groups in bronze of Castor\r\nand Pollux, by San Giorgio of Milan. The originals stand in that\r\nbeautiful city. Here also, in a corresponding position to the statue of\r\nGattamelata, but nearer towards the nave, is the superb statue of\r\nColleone. In the glass cases on the side next the Transept may be seen a\r\nmost interesting collection of casts from ivory carvings, from the 2nd\r\nto the 15th century. These have been published by the Arundel\r\nSociety.[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] The Arundel Society has been formed by a number of gentlemen,\r\n  lovers of the Fine Arts, for the laudable purpose of publishing such\r\n  works as, however valuable in themselves, are not likely by an\r\n  extensive sale to repay a publisher; its means for this purpose being\r\n  provided by such annual subscriptions as it may secure.\r\n\r\nFor minute and interesting information respecting the monuments, and all\r\nthe statues on this side of the Palace, the visitor is referred to the\r\nHandbooks of the Mediæval and Italian Courts (by Messrs. M. D. Wyatt and\r\nJ. B. Waring), where they are fully described.\r\n\r\nCrossing the great transept to the west, we proceed towards the south\r\nend of the building, and, keeping to the right-hand, commence our\r\npilgrimage through the Industrial Courts. The first that we arrive at is\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONERY COURT.[20]\r\n\r\nIn the formation of this and of the other Industrial Courts, the several\r\narchitects have been solicitous to express, both in the construction and\r\nthe decoration, as far as possible, the specific destination; with the\r\nview of maintaining some harmony between the objects exhibited and the\r\nbuilding in which they are contained. The Stationery Court was designed\r\nand erected by Mr. J. G. Crace. The style of this Court is composite,\r\nand may be regarded as the application of cinque-cento ornamental\r\ndecoration to a wooden structure. Externally the aim has been to furnish\r\ncertain coloured surfaces, which shall harmonise with the plants around\r\nand with the general aspect of the Palace. In the interior of the Court,\r\nthe colour on the lower level will be seen to serve as an admirable\r\nbackground to the objects exhibited; whilst the panels covered with\r\ncinque-cento decoration, combined with the elegant imitation of\r\nmarquetrie work, produce an effect which deserves the highest praise.\r\nOver the opening through which we enter this Court, and between the\r\nstained glass windows let into the wall, have been introduced\r\nallegorical figures of the arts and sciences applied in the manufacture\r\nof the articles exhibited in the Court, and over the opening at the\r\nback the artist has depicted the _Genii_ of Manufacture, Commerce, &c.\r\nIn the centre of the panels throughout the Court representations are\r\npainted of the processes which the objects exhibited undergo during\r\ntheir manufacture.\r\n\r\n  [20] See “Exhibitors’ Descriptive Catalogue,” Part IV. of this book.\r\n\r\nAs the visitor passes round this Court, let him step out at one of the\r\nentrances on the north side, close to which he will find erected “THE\r\nCRYSTAL PALACE MEDAL PRESS.” This machine, which is official, and worked\r\non behalf of the Company by Messrs. T. R. Pinches & Co., is employed\r\nfrom time to time in striking commemorative medals, designed by Mr.\r\nPinches or other artists connected with the Palace. The machine is\r\nworked by four men, one of whom adjusts the metal to be stamped between\r\nthe sunk dies: as soon as the metal is fixed, the other workmen swing\r\nthe lever rapidly round, and the great pressure produces impressions of\r\nthe dies on the metal, which is turned out sharp and distinct, and then\r\nput into a lathe and completed. In the glass cases placed near, the\r\nvisitor will have an opportunity of inspecting numerous specimens of the\r\nmedals produced by the machine, amongst which those in frosted silver\r\ndeserve especial notice for the beauty of their appearance.\r\n\r\nThe visitor, proceeding round the Stationery Court, from right to left,\r\nwill find amongst the works of industry exhibited, specimens of\r\nBank-note Engraving and Medallion Line-engraving, book-binding, and\r\nprinting, including the new art of Nature-printing, paper manufacture,\r\nand Artists’ colours, also stereoscopic views and other articles of the\r\nkind. Outside this Court, between it and the Birmingham Court, are some\r\nbeautiful and interesting specimens of artistic printing in colours. At\r\nthe back of this and of the Birmingham Court, or towards the west front\r\nof the building, is situated “THE HARDWARE COURT,” in which are placed\r\nhousehold utensils, iron and zinc bronzes, gas-fittings, refrigerators,\r\nand numerous articles in metals.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the Hardware and Stationery Courts, is a Court\r\ndedicated to New Inventions. This very interesting department is filled\r\nwith ingenious contrivances of all kinds, and is well worthy of a visit.\r\n\r\nBeyond this Court again, and flanking the Hardware Court, is a large\r\nspace extending in a southerly direction to the Pompeian Court (at which\r\nthe visitor will presently arrive), divided into several large chambers\r\nwhich are devoted to the exhibition of furniture. Here will be found not\r\nonly useful articles of household furniture, but specimens of tapestry\r\nwork, wood carving, picture frames, and other ornamental articles which\r\ngive grace to our rooms, and which, by means of our great mechanical\r\nexcellence, are daily becoming more and more within the reach of the\r\ngreat body of the people. The visitor will do well, in examining these\r\nCourts, to view them in sections, so as not to miss those Industrial\r\nCourts which face the Nave.\r\n\r\nNext in order of the Industrial establishments, comes\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRMINGHAM COURT.[21]\r\n\r\nThis Court has been designed by Mr. Tite, and the architect has\r\nconsidered that the purpose to which the Court is applied might best be\r\nexpressed by showing some of the principal ornamental uses of iron in\r\narchitecture. With this intention, he has designed for the façade of the\r\ncourt a restoration, in modern work, of the English ornamental iron\r\nenclosures of the 17th century, which differed but slightly from those\r\nprevailing at the same time in France in the style of Louis XIV. The\r\nEnglish, however, are generally richer in foliage, while the latter are\r\nmore fanciful in scroll-work. At the period referred to, the whole of\r\nthose enclosures were of wrought and hammered iron, cast-iron being at\r\nthat time little known; but in the enclosure before us, although it has\r\nbeen executed on much the same principle as the old work, the ornaments\r\nare cast, in order to secure greater durability, cast-iron not being so\r\neasily destroyed as wrought iron, by the oxidation which proceeds with\r\nsuch enormous rapidity in this country. The castings have been most\r\nadmirably executed, and so sharp and distinct were the outlines of the\r\npatterns, that they required but little after-finishing. The pilasters\r\nare of enamelled slate, excellent for their imitation of marble,\r\nsurmounted by iron capitals. Entering through the gates in the centre,\r\nthe visitor finds the interior of the court panelled in the style of the\r\nsame period, and decorated by Mr. Sang with emblematical paintings and\r\nother appropriate ornamentation in encaustic.\r\n\r\n  [21] See “Exhibitors’ Descriptive Catalogue,” Part IV. of this book.\r\n\r\nIn this Court will be found specimens of plate, articles in nickel\r\nsilver, seal-presses, gilt toys, curious locks, and similar manufactured\r\ngoods of universal use, from the multifarious productions of the busy\r\ntown which gives its name to the Court. On leaving the court, we notice\r\nsome splendid specimens of bronze casting, and other works of artistic\r\nmetal manufacture, belonging to Messrs. Elkington & Co. Quitting this\r\ndepartment, we approach next in succession,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHEFFIELD COURT.[22]\r\n\r\nThe architect of this Court is Mr. G. H. Stokes, whose structure compels\r\nattention by the novelty of its design, and by its generally striking\r\neffect. Although there is a considerable admixture of styles in the\r\nCourt, the parts have been so well selected, and their blending is so\r\nexcellently contrived, that they yield a harmonious result in every way\r\npleasing to the eye. The materials used in the construction are\r\nplate-glass and iron, an appropriate and happy selection for a court\r\nintended to receive the productions of Sheffield. The panels on the\r\nouter walls are of plate-glass, inclosed within gilt-mouldings; the\r\npilasters and the frieze over the large panels are likewise of\r\nplate-glass. The iron columns above, forming an arcade, are in a\r\ncomposite Moresque-Gothic style, and elaborately ornamental in design.\r\nEntering the Court from the Nave, we find the interior decorations\r\nidentical with those of the exterior--with two differences, viz., the\r\nlarge lower panels, instead of being of plate-glass, are of red cloth,\r\nwhich serves as a background to throw up and display the articles\r\nexhibited. The frieze or space above the columns is covered with painted\r\ndecorations. The articles exhibited in this Court present an excellent\r\nrepresentation of the important manufactures for which Sheffield is so\r\ncelebrated, and which are sought by all the world. It is impossible not\r\nto extol the beauty and curiosity, as well as the completeness, of these\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\n  [22] See “Exhibitors’ Descriptive Catalogue,” Part IV. of this book.\r\n\r\nHaving made our way to the Nave, a step brings us at once before the\r\nexquisite restoration of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POMPEIAN COURT.[23]\r\n\r\nSeventeen hundred and seventy-five years ago, the cities of Herculaneum\r\nand Pompeii, beautifully situated on the shores of the Bay of Naples,\r\nwere buried beneath the lava and ashes vomited forth by Vesuvius. The\r\nhorrors of this calamity are recorded in the writings of Pliny, and of\r\nother Roman historians of the period. So sudden was the outbreak and\r\ngeneral convulsion that, as we learn, many of the inhabitants of those\r\ncities were caught in their terrible doom before the thought of escape\r\noccurred to them. The dread event completed, nature resumed her former\r\naspect. The mountain flames ceased, the intense blue sky again looked\r\ndown upon the dancing waters, and there was nothing to tell of the\r\ngeneral havoc, but a vast desolate tract covered with white ashes, under\r\nwhich man and his works lay entombed.\r\n\r\n  [23] See “Handbook to the Pompeian Court,” by George Scharf, jun.\r\n\r\nFor upwards of sixteen hundred years these cities remained buried. But\r\nabout the middle of the last century, curiosity with respect to them was\r\nstirred, inquiry commenced, and excavations were attempted. As in the\r\nmore recent case of Nineveh, but with still more satisfactory results,\r\nsuccess at once crowned investigation. The material that had destroyed\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii had also preserved them. That which had robbed\r\nthem of life had also perpetuated their story in death. The cities were\r\nredelivered to man so far undecayed, that he obtained actual visible\r\nknowledge of the manner of life of one of the most remarkable people\r\nthat ever governed the world. To the insight thus obtained, the visitor\r\nis indebted for the reproduction of the Pompeian house before which he\r\nnow stands--a habitation of the time, complete in every respect. It is\r\nnot asserted that the visitor beholds the actual ground-plan of any one\r\nspecific house, but he sees the type of a Pompeian villa, made up of\r\nmany fragments that have been found. The paintings and decorations are\r\ncopies of originals found in the destroyed cities.\r\n\r\nThe doorway of this house stands fronting the Nave. Entering it, we pass\r\nthrough the narrow prothyrum or passage, on either side of which is a\r\nroom devoted to the door-keeper and slaves, and on its pavement the\r\nrepresentation in mosaic of a savage dog, and the words “_cave\r\ncanem_”--beware of the dog--meet the eye. It is the usual notice found\r\non the threshold of these Roman houses. Emerging from the passage, we\r\nare at once in the “_atrium_,” or outer court of the edifice. The eye is\r\nnot attracted here, as in other restorations of the palace, by the\r\narchitectural design alone; the attention is also secured and charmed by\r\nthe decorations. The bright coloured walls, the light fanciful character\r\nof the ornaments, the variety of patterns, and the excellent method of\r\ncolouring,--which at the lower part is dark, and graduates upwards,\r\nuntil it becomes white on the ceiling,--constitute some of the\r\nbeautiful features that give individuality to Pompeian houses, and cause\r\nthem to differ most essentially from every other style.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan of Pompeian Court.]\r\n\r\nThis entire court, or “_atrium_,” was the part of the building common to\r\nall visitors. The opening above is the “_compluvium_,” and the marble\r\nbasin beneath, the “_impluvium_,” which received the rain that fell from\r\nthe roof. In the actual houses at Pompeii, the size of the “_impluvium_”\r\ncorresponds, of course, with the dimensions of the opening above. Here\r\nthe “_compluvium_” has been widened in order to admit more light into\r\nthe court. The flooring consists of tesselated pavement, and near the\r\ntwo other doorways leading into the “_atrium_” is inscribed the\r\nwell-known word “Salve”--“welcome”--announcing the profuse hospitality\r\nof the owner. Two out of the three entrances mentioned are formed here\r\nfor convenience of egress and ingress, and are not copied from actual\r\nbuildings, in which there are sometimes to be found, however, a _porta\r\npostica_, or back door.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we have entered the Court, we turn to the right, and proceed\r\nround it, stepping into the “_cubicula_,” or bed-chambers, to admire the\r\nfigures that seem to be suspended in the intensely fine atmosphere,\r\nand--with our English experiences--to wonder how, whether by day or by\r\nnight, comfort could be attained in such close dormitories. We reach the\r\nside entrance, next to which is an open recess corresponding with a\r\nsecond recess on the other side of the “_atrium_.” These recesses were\r\ncalled “_alæ_” or wings, and were used for the transaction of business\r\nwith visitors. On the central panel of the first recess is painted a\r\nscene from the story of “Perseus and Andromeda,” and on the side panel\r\nare again exquisite figures, painted not in the centre of the panel,\r\nproducing a stiff formality, but nearer to the top than to the bottom,\r\nso that the forms still seem to float before us. Continuing our way, we\r\nturn into the large apartment opposite the door at which we entered.\r\nThis is the “_tablinum_,” and was used for the reception of the family\r\narchives, pictures, and objects of art. Across the “_tablinum_” a\r\ncurtain was sometimes drawn, to separate the private dwelling-house from\r\nthe more public “_atrium_,” although it is a remarkable fact that no\r\nremains of hooks or rings, or of anything else, has been discovered to\r\nconvey an idea of the means by which such a curtain could be attached.\r\nIn order to enter within the “_tablinum_” a special invitation was\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POMPEIAN COURT.]\r\n\r\nFrom this point, the “Peristyle” is also visible, with its columns\r\ncoloured red some way up, a Xystus or flower-garden, and a back wall,\r\nupon which are curious specimens of perspective decoration, in which the\r\nRomans seem to have delighted. This court was always open to the sky in\r\nthe middle. Passing through the “_tablinum_,” and turning to the right,\r\nwe come to a small doorway which admits us into the “_triclinium_,” or\r\nwinter dining-room. The Roman dining-room generally contained three\r\ncouches, each large enough to hold three persons. In feeding, the Roman\r\nwas accustomed to lie on his left side and to stretch out his hand\r\ntowards the table in order to serve himself. Re-entering the\r\n“Peristyle,” we proceed on our way, still to the right, and pass a\r\nsummer triclinium used in warm weather, on the walls of which fruits are\r\npainted, some hanging in golden clusters on a wreath of foliage,\r\nsupported by Cupids. Next to this is the “_porta postica_,” or back\r\ndoor, and adjoining it a small recess, which served as kitchen. Crossing\r\nthe “Peristyle,” near one end of which is the domestic altar, we turn to\r\nthe left, and after passing a small chamber, the “_vestiarium_,” or\r\ndressing-room, reach the “_balneum_,” or bath-room--that chamber so\r\nessential to the luxurious Roman. Close to this is the _æcus_, or\r\nsaloon, and beyond this again, and corresponding with the\r\n“_triclinium_,” is the “_thalamus_” or bed-chamber of the master of the\r\nhouse. Quitting this, we once more gain the “_atrium_” by means of\r\nnarrow _fauces_, or passages, and return to the Nave, through the door\r\nof the house at which we originally entered. The visitor has seen the\r\nextremes of decorative art, when, after sating his eyes with the profuse\r\nand dazzling embellishment of the Alhambra, he has also dwelt upon the\r\ndelicate work of colours gracing the walls of Pompeii. From the gallery\r\nabove the visitor may see the form of the ancient tiled roof made of the\r\npeculiar tiles still occasionally used in Italy. This court was erected\r\nby Mr. Digby Wyatt. The paintings were executed under the\r\nsuperintendence of Sig. Giuseppe Abbate, of the Museum, at Naples. The\r\nmosaic floor was manufactured by Minton from drawings after antique\r\nMosaic by Mr. Wyatt; and the bronze groups in the _tablinum_, and the\r\nVenus in the _lararium_, were electrotyped and presented by Messrs.\r\nElkington and Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nUpon quitting the Pompeian Court the visitor, still walking southwards,\r\ncrosses the south transept and enters that division of the building\r\nwhich is devoted to geographical groupings of men, animals, and plants.\r\nThe illustrations of the animal and vegetable kingdoms in the Crystal\r\nPalace have been arranged upon a specific principle and plan. Although\r\nthe British Museum contains nearly all the examples of animals and birds\r\nknown in the world, and Kew Gardens exhibit specimens of the majority of\r\ntrees and plants known to botanists, still neither of these collections\r\naffords the visitor any accurate idea of the manner in which these\r\nnumerous objects are scattered over the earth. Nor do they assist his\r\nconjectures as to the nature or the general aspect of their native\r\ncountries. Here an attempt has been made to remove the confusion; and it\r\nis believed that the associations of those two branches of Natural\r\nScience, in groupings arranged in such a manner as the nature of the\r\nbuilding will permit, coupled with illustrations of the human variety\r\nbelonging to the same soil (a collection which has never before been\r\nattempted in any country), will prove both instructive and amusing, and\r\nafford a clearer conception than can be obtained elsewhere of the manner\r\nin which the varieties of man, animals, and plants, are distributed over\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nZoology (from _Zoön_, an animal) is, strictly speaking, that science\r\nwhich investigates the whole animal kingdom, comprehending man as well\r\nas the inferior animals. Zoology, therefore, in a wide sense, includes\r\nEthnology, or so much of that science as considers the different\r\nvarieties or races of men in a physical point of view, instituting\r\ncomparisons between them, and carefully pointing out the differences or\r\naffinities which characterise the physical structure of various branches\r\nof the great human family. In more confined use, the term zoology\r\nrelates only to the consideration and study of the mammalia, or suckling\r\nanimals; the requirements of scientific research having occasioned a new\r\nnomenclature in order to distinguish the different branches of the same\r\nstudy. Hence the natural history of birds is particularised as\r\nOrnithology, and that of fish as Ichthyology, whilst the investigation\r\nof those characters in man which serve to distinguish one race from\r\nanother is, as previously remarked, called Ethnology (from the Greek\r\n_Ethnos_, “nation”). This last-named science is subdivided again into\r\ndifferent branches, but, in a limited and inferior sense, and as\r\nillustrated by the various groups in the Palace, it may be described as\r\nthat science which distinguishes the differences in skin, hair, bone,\r\nand stature that exist between the various races of men. This zoological\r\nbranch of Ethnology relates to the physical history of man as opposed to\r\nhis mental history, and, following up the course of his wanderings,\r\nendeavours by the above-mentioned physical peculiarities to ascend to\r\nthe source from which the several migrating races have proceeded.\r\n\r\nWithin the Palace itself, we have been enabled to remark the works of\r\nman, and the gradual development of his ideas, especially in Art,\r\nleading to a variety of so-called “styles,” which answer in a measure to\r\nthe varied _species_ of Divinely created life. We have now an\r\nopportunity of attentively considering the more marvellous and infinite\r\ncreations of the Deity in the organisation and development of that\r\ngreatest of all mysteries--life itself; and of obtaining a vivid idea of\r\nthose peculiar varieties of mankind, that have hitherto not fallen under\r\nour personal observation. If the visitor should feel astonishment in\r\nthe presence of some of the phases of human existence here presented to\r\nhim, he may do well to bear in mind, that they are representations of\r\nhuman beings endowed with immortal souls; to whose capabilities we may\r\nnot place a limit, and that it is not yet two thousand years since the\r\nforefathers of the present European family tattooed their skins, and\r\nlived in so savage a state, that late archæological researches induce us\r\nto suspect they were not wholly free from one of the worst charges that\r\nis laid to savage existence; viz. the practice of cannibalism.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] Archæol. Journ., p. 207. Sept. 1853.\r\n\r\nEntering upon the path immediately before him, the visitor will commence\r\nthe examination of the groups arranged on the western side of the nave.\r\nTurning up the right-hand path, we find on the right a general\r\nillustration of Australia. The men here represented are copied from\r\nliving natives of Cape York, North Australia, and strike us at once, by\r\ntheir half-starved, lanky, and ill-proportioned bodies, curiously\r\ntattooed; they may be looked upon as savages, hunters, and inhabitants\r\nof the forest; they possess that excessive projection of the jaw, which\r\nethnologists make one of the distinguishing traits in the most degraded\r\nforms of man. These figures were modelled from some living natives who\r\nwere brought to England in 1853, and who were kept for some weeks by the\r\nCompany on purpose that these portraits should be accurately rendered.\r\n\r\nAmongst the animals will be noticed that most characteristic form, the\r\nKangaroo, of which there are several species, and the Opossum, or Fox\r\nPhalangister, with a young one in its pouch. There are likewise\r\nspecimens of the Duck-billed Platypus, Cook’s Phalangister, a Flying\r\nOpossum, an Emu, and a large rat called Hydromys. Some fine cases of\r\nAustralian birds stand in the Transept close by. Here the visitor will\r\nfind numerous plants, with which he is acquainted in conservatories; the\r\n_Banksia_, the _Acacias_, and the different kinds of _Epacris_ and\r\n_Eriostemon_, are amongst the most conspicuous. He will see also\r\nspecimens of three other kinds of _Araucaria_, the most elegant of which\r\nis the Norfolk Island Pine.\r\n\r\nNearer to the staircase, and adjoining the Australians, is a group of\r\nPapuans from the Louisiade Archipelago, remarkable by their curious\r\nfrizzled hair; they are neither Malays nor Negroes, but a mixed race\r\nbetween these two, retaining the characteristics of the tribes from\r\nwhich they have sprung; hence they may be called Malay-Negroes. Behind\r\nthem is a fine Cassowary, a curious bird, indigenous to the Indian\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand of the visitor, as he stands opposite the Australian\r\nfigures, is arranged a group of Botocudos, inhabitants of that district\r\nin South America watered by the rivers Doce and Pardo. They have been\r\nregarded as the fiercest of American savages; they are yellow in colour,\r\ntheir hair is long and lank, their eyes are small, their cheek-bones\r\nprominent, the expression of their countenance excessively savage; and\r\nthey give themselves a still wilder appearance by the insertion of\r\npieces of hard wood in the under lip and in the ears, distending the\r\nflesh in a peculiar and strange manner. From this barbarous practice\r\nthey derived their appellation of Botocudos, from the Portuguese. The\r\noperation of thus distending the lip is not, of course, carried out at\r\nonce, but from infancy by the gradual increase in size of the piece of\r\nwood inserted. This may be noticed in the model of the child as compared\r\nwith the adult natives. Missionary efforts, it is consolatory to think,\r\nhave done something towards civilising these savages, who have been\r\ninduced to become industrious, and to turn their attention to the\r\ncultivation of the soil. On the summit of the rockwork, over where three\r\nof the natives appear to be in council, are two fine specimens of the\r\nBlack Jaguar and the Ocelot.\r\n\r\nWe now pass a case of birds belonging to North America, and at this\r\npoint the illustrations of that country commence. In the centre of this\r\ncase will be remarked a fine specimen of the Wild Turkey, from which our\r\ndomestic breed is derived. On the left of this path is a group of North\r\nAmerican Red Indians engaged in a war-dance, and surrounded by trees and\r\nshrubs indigenous to North America. The Indians of the valley of the\r\nMississippi, and of the _drainage_ of the Great Lakes, supply us with\r\nour current ideas of the so-called Red Man, or the Indian of the New\r\nWorld. In stature they are above the middle height, and exhibit great\r\nmuscular force, their powers of endurance being very great; in temper\r\nthey are harsh, stoical, and unsociable, whilst in warfare they are\r\nsavage and cruel. The general physiognomy of the Red Indians is the same\r\nfrom the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic. Between the Alleghanies and\r\nthe Atlantic, the first-known country of these tribes, the variety is\r\nnow nearly extinct. The most conspicuous plants are the American\r\nRhododendrons, the Kalmias, the Andromedas, and the American Arbor Vitæ.\r\nAmongst the foliage we see the Black Bear, the Otter, the Beaver, the\r\nGrey Squirrel, and other animals indigenous to the country.\r\n\r\nPassing now round the right-hand path, we find on our right the men,\r\nplants, and animals of Central America; amongst the latter, on the top\r\nof the rock-work, a fine male Puma grey with age. The Puma may be\r\nregarded as the American representative of the Lion of the old world,\r\nthe distribution of both these animals throughout their respective\r\nhemispheres having originally been very general. Like most of the cat\r\ntribe, the Puma is a good climber, and usually chooses trees, rocks, and\r\nother elevated positions from which it can dart upon its prey. Before\r\nreaching this, the visitor will note a large specimen of _Agave\r\nAmericana_, one of the most striking plants of Central America; he will\r\nalso note that this is the land of the justly-admired Verbenas and\r\nFuchsias, amongst which he will find a specimen of the large\r\nprehensile-tailed Porcupine. The men are representatives of the Indians\r\nof Mexico generally, rather than of any particular tribes.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the visitor are two groups of men; the two reclining\r\nfigures are characteristic of Guiana, and beyond them is the Amazonian\r\ngroup. At the back, to the left of these two groups, is a large group of\r\nCaribs, some using blowpipes, others shooting fish with bows and arrows.\r\nThese three are intended to serve as types of the northern varieties of\r\nSouth American Indians. And if we institute a comparison between the\r\nvarious races of North and South America, it will be found that the\r\nlatter possess more delicate features, rounder forms, and are of smaller\r\nstature. Their habits and pursuits also differ. The Red Indian of North\r\nAmerica gives himself up entirely to hunting, whilst the South American\r\ndevotes his life to fishing, guiding his light canoe down the\r\nrapid-rolling rivers of his country, in search of the means of\r\nsubsistence. In front of the Carib group are two Agoutis, and one\r\nunfortunate Marmoset Monkey in the clutches of a Skunk, while another is\r\nmaking his escape; also a small Fox, and a Tayra; and beyond the Amazon\r\ngroup is a little prehensile-tailed Porcupine.\r\n\r\nThe two cases of Birds which we now pass are especially brilliant, as\r\nthey contain the Humming Birds and others of the splendid species of\r\nTropical America. The specimens are not only remarkable for their\r\nmagnificent plumage, but in many instances (as with the Toucan) for\r\ntheir peculiar conformation as fitted to their habits of subsistence.\r\nThe long and slender bills of the Humming Birds, who probe the flowers\r\nin search of food, contrast with the apparent unwieldiness of the\r\nToucan’s bill, adapted to tear from the branches the fruit upon which it\r\nfeeds. Passing round, we notice a Jaguar about to devour a Brocket\r\nDeer. As the Leopard is found only in the Old World, so is the Jaguar\r\npeculiar to the New World, and each may be regarded as a representative\r\nof the other, on opposite sides of the Atlantic ocean; the Jaguar having\r\ngreatly the advantage in size and muscular strength.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Arctic illustrations, commencing with a case of\r\nBirds, many of which were collected by Captain Inglefield during one of\r\nthe recent Arctic expeditions, and presented by him to the Crystal\r\nPalace. The specimens are arranged to represent some of the changes of\r\nplumage which, at various seasons of the year, are incident to the birds\r\nin these remote and extreme climates. The Snowy Owls, the Eider Duck,\r\nthe Gannet, and various birds frequenting the sea-coast, are beautiful\r\nand prominent specimens in the collection.\r\n\r\nIt has been attempted in this illustration to present the visitor with\r\nsome idea of the peculiar features of this region. It was necessary\r\nhere, in the absence of all botanical specimens so attractive in the\r\nother departments, to attempt the representation of icebergs, and the\r\nsnowy aspect of the country. The Ethnological group in the further\r\nrecess is formed of two Samoiedes, or natives of Arctic Russia in their\r\nwinter dresses of fur. The male native holds in his hand a pair of the\r\nvery peculiar snow-shoes which are used by these people. The group\r\nnearest to the spectator consists of two males, a female, and child of\r\nthe Lapland race, in their curious national dress. The scarlet costume\r\nof one of the male figures is, however, the summer dress, but is placed\r\nhere for contrast with the other example, which is the kind of clothing\r\nadopted in the rigorous winter. On the right appears a Greenlander in\r\nhis skin canoe, and armed with the implements of chase, by which he\r\ncaptures Whales, Seals, Birds, and other animals. The largest Polar or\r\nWhite Bear was killed by Captain Inglefield with a single pistol shot,\r\nwhen he was closely and dangerously attacked by the monster. The other\r\nanimals consist chiefly of the Reindeer, Arctic Foxes, Esquimaux Dogs,\r\nSeals, &c. This illustration has been arranged and designed by Mr. A. D.\r\nBartlett, under whose superintendence the Natural History Department is\r\nnow placed.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this side of the Palace to proceed in the examination of\r\nthe Natural History Department on the other side of the Nave, we must\r\nnot omit to particularly notice the interesting illustrations of aquatic\r\nnatural history, which will be found in the various positions which are\r\nindicated. Most of these differ from the other objects in the\r\ndepartment, inasmuch as they are living specimens; but they will all\r\ntend to give us some idea of how vast and how wonderful are the works of\r\nNature, how various and how marvellously fitted each to its own function\r\nin the great universe. On the right-hand side of the path by which we\r\nentered the department from the Transept, is a case filled with West\r\nIndian sponges, arranged to represent, as far as may be, the aspect of\r\nthe bottom of the sea in that region, and the form of growth of these\r\ncurious marine productions. This rare collection of sponges is the\r\nproperty of J. S. Bowerbank, Esq., who has kindly lent them to the\r\nCrystal Palace Company, and arranged them himself.\r\n\r\nWe should now return to the staircase, near where the Botocudos and\r\nAustralian illustrations are. Here two large tanks are fitted up as\r\nmarine aquaria. The specimens are arranged in real sea-water. In the\r\ntank under the staircase, and nearest to the Botocudos, are placed\r\nspecimens of the swimming fish most generally found on the coasts of\r\nGreat Britain. It is not necessary here to particularise any of the\r\nvarious kinds, as a system has been adopted of affixing the specific\r\nnames to the tank itself, for the readier and more effective\r\nidentification of these interesting objects.\r\n\r\nIn the other tank, on the left-hand, those species of Crustaceæ which\r\nmay be most properly designated _active Crustaceæ_ are exhibited. A\r\nsimilar plan for the identification of the specimens is adopted as with\r\nthe other tanks. Amongst these interesting specimens, the curious\r\nmovements of the Soldier Crab, or, as called by some, the Hermit Crab,\r\nare very noticeable. This peculiar animal is not himself gifted with a\r\nshell upon his body, although his legs and claws are covered with the\r\nusual protection. To remedy this want, his habit is to attack some\r\nunivalve, most generally the common Whelk, and having devoured the\r\ninmate, to adopt the shell as his own, moving about with it from place\r\nto place with great apparent convenience. He is not, however, always\r\nleft in undisturbed possession of his stolen tenement, for the _Actinea\r\nparasitica_ frequently attaches himself, with apparent purpose, to the\r\nshell, and thus, as it were, enslaves the inmate. The crab can, however,\r\neasily adapt himself to a new habitation, and may be frequently induced\r\nto the operation, if tempted by the introduction of a better shell. The\r\ntanks containing the Madrepores, Actineæ, and those species of\r\nMolluscous animals, which from their habits may be termed _inactive_,\r\nwill be described in the proper positions on the other side of the\r\nNave.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Nave in front of the screen of Kings and Queens, we\r\ncontinue our examination of the various Natural History illustrations on\r\nthe garden side of the Palace. Keeping then to the extreme right of this\r\ndivision, the first group we come to illustrates generally the Bushmen\r\nof South Africa. These have been variously designated by travellers as\r\nBosjesmen and Earthmen, but are of one race. The group represents an\r\nentire family. This singular race of beings are persecuted and despised\r\nnot only by Europeans but by the other tribes. They are migratory, and\r\nfix their abodes on unappropriated tracts of land, which frequently\r\nseparate hostile tribes. The race is fast disappearing. The animals of\r\nthis division (South Africa) are the Hippopotamus, the Bubaline\r\nAntelope, a large Crocodile, and on the rocks opposite to the\r\nHippopotamus is the Cape Hyrax, or Rock Rabbit, a curious animal, much\r\nmore nearly related to the Rhinoceros than to the Rabbit.\r\n\r\nFurther on we come to Eastern Africa, which is here represented by a\r\ngroup of Danakils, who inhabit the country between Abyssinia and the\r\nsea, leading a camel to water. The Danakils are a nomade or wandering\r\ntribe; they are of a chocolate-coloured complexion, and have long,\r\ncoarse, wavy hair, which they often dress in a fantastic manner; they\r\nare of slender make, tall, and differ widely in appearance from the\r\nNegro. The Danakils are transitional between the Negro and the Arab,\r\npossess a Jewish physiognomy, and have acquired the Negro element from\r\ntheir intercourse with the neighbouring members of that race. The Negro\r\nform and physiognomy are much more strongly developed in the man on the\r\nright of the Dromedary, who belongs to the Msegurra tribe. In this\r\ndistrict will also be found a fine natural historical group,\r\nrepresenting a Leopard attacking a Duyker-bok.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the path in which we now are is a group of Zulu\r\nKaffres. This fine people are far advanced before the rest of the South\r\nAfrican races; they are in a measure civilised; some of them build\r\nhouses and towns, and pay considerable attention to arts and\r\nmanufactures. Thousands of them have lately entered the service of\r\nEuropeans as farm-servants and labourers; in these capacities they are\r\nmost honest and trustworthy. In general they are tall, strong, and\r\nwell-proportioned; their skin is usually of a brown colour, but this\r\nvaries in intensity; their hair is woolly; their foreheads high, and\r\ncheek-bones prominent. They are an active and warlike race, and of a\r\npredatory disposition. Having inspected this group, we should return and\r\nproceed down the path, then to our left. We shall pass, on our left,\r\namongst other animals, three specimens of the Chimpanzee, the animal\r\nwhose form most nearly resembles that of man (excepting the Gorilla).\r\nThese are found on the western coast of Africa, though they may probably\r\nalso exist in the far interior where no European as yet has penetrated.\r\nThough somewhat similar to the Ourang Outang of Sumatra in general form,\r\nthe Chimpanzee is a smaller animal. It lives in woods, builds huts, or\r\nrather a protection from the sun and rain; uses clubs for attack as well\r\nas for defence; and in many ways exhibits an intelligence that presses\r\nwith rather uncomfortable nearness upon the pride of the sole rational\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Chimpanzees.]\r\n\r\nTurning then to the left, the first group we come to is one which\r\nillustrates an episode in the wild life of the savage. Two native\r\nMexicans appear to have come suddenly upon a Jaguar, who has struck down\r\na small deer for his prey, and to have attacked him with the bow and\r\narrow; the wounded and infuriated animal is about to spring from the\r\nrock upon his adversary, whose footing has slipped, when the other\r\nnative advances boldly with a spear to receive the attack and to rescue\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\nBeyond this is represented a battle between two Leopards, forcibly\r\nreminding us of a quarrel between two cats, which, in fact, it is. Any\r\none who has seen one cat advancing towards another, must have observed\r\nthat there is always a desire to receive the assault lying on the back,\r\nwith the four legs upwards. The motive is to be in a position to have\r\nfree use of the claws of all the legs; and in the group before us,\r\nthough the smaller animal appears to have the advantage both by position\r\nand by the grip he has taken on the throat of the other, yet the\r\nlaceration he is receiving underneath from the hind legs of the larger\r\nanimal will soon oblige him to release his hold. Close by are two\r\nGazelles, as well as some Mediterranean animals, such as the Barbary\r\nApe, the Corsican Goat, and two specimens of the Mouflon Sheep. The\r\nvegetation includes Orange and Lemon trees, the Date Palm, the Oleander,\r\nthe Sweet Bay tree, and the Laurustinus. If the visitor here turns round\r\nto his right, a little further on, he will find a beautiful case,\r\ncontaining some superb specimens of the Game birds which are found in\r\nthe Himalayan districts.\r\n\r\nIn this path he will pass, on his left, some illustrations of the most\r\neastern part of temperate Asia. Two Tibetans represent the general\r\nphysiognomy of the inhabitants. The animals are all rare: amongst them\r\nis the Chiru, a curious sheep-like Antelope; the Siberian Marmot; the\r\nYaks, or grunting oxen, which are used by the Tartars for riding or\r\ndriving, as well as for food or clothing; the tail being very much in\r\nrequest in India for brushing away flies, no less than as an emblem of\r\nauthority; of these Yaks there are two specimens here, the largest being\r\nthe animal in its wild state, the smaller one as it is domesticated by\r\nthe Tartars; and the Ounce, a species of Leopard peculiar to the\r\nHimalayan Mountains, an animal which three hundred years ago was\r\ncomparatively well known, but whose skin has since become so rare that\r\nthe very existence of the animal has been questioned. European\r\ntravellers have lately visited its haunts in Central Asia, and\r\nsatisfactorily proved that it still lives. In the glass case further on,\r\nare two specimens of the great horned sheep of Chinese Tartary. The\r\nBotany here is from various sources: China, Siberia, Japan, and Nepaul\r\nhave each contributed a few plants, amongst the most conspicuous of\r\nwhich are the Camellias and the Oriental Arbor Vitæ, which is the\r\nAsiatic representative of the similar plant in the new world. Amongst\r\nthis botanical group will be found also specimens of the black and green\r\nTea-plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Yak.]\r\n\r\nFacing the visitor at this point under the staircase, and in\r\ncorresponding positions to those described on the other side of the\r\nbuilding, are two more large sea-water tanks. Those classes of\r\nMolluscous animals, which, we have termed, for the sake of distinction,\r\n_inactive_, are located here. Several of these are beautiful Actineæ,\r\nmore commonly called _Sea Anemones_, from their similitude both in form\r\nand colour to flowers. There are numerous species of these animals, and\r\nan endless variety of beautiful colouring may be noticed on them. They\r\nare found in every sea, but those in warm latitudes usually surpass in\r\nbeauty the denizens of more temperate or colder waters. Here also are\r\nsome Madrepores, which, however, must be spoken of more as an assemblage\r\nof multitudes of minute animals than as one. The curious little\r\nlong-shaped shell, from which the inmate emerges like a scarlet blossom,\r\nand into which he darts when disturbed, must also be noticed.[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] A very large fresh-water aquarium, on a comprehensive plan, is in\r\n  course of preparation, and will shortly be added to this department.\r\n\r\nNear the carriages is a Case containing a Sun Fish, presented by Edmund\r\nCalvert, Esq., and the rest of the specimens (which are all British)\r\nare, like those in the two Australian Cases which stand outside the\r\nglass doors leading to the staircase, the property of J. S. Bowerbank,\r\nEsq., by whom they have been personally arranged to represent the\r\nappearance of the sea-bottom. The Birds in the two Cases at the foot of\r\nthe stairs belong to Africa.\r\n\r\nWith these we complete our rapid survey of the Natural History\r\ndepartment of the Crystal Palace. It remains to mention that the\r\nEthnological section was formed under the direction of Dr. Latham; that\r\nthe Zoological Collection was formed by Mr. G. R. Waterhouse; that Mr.\r\nGould formed the Ornithological Collection, and that Sir Joseph Paxton\r\nsupplied the plants to illustrate the Botany. The whole of the natural\r\nhistory arrangements were effected under the general direction of\r\nProfessor Edward Forbes, and the personal superintendence of Mr. Wm.\r\nThomson.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the left, a few paces bring us to the first Industrial\r\nCourt on this side.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN GLASS MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\nThis Court has been allotted for the exhibition and sale of Bohemian and\r\nBavarian glass manufactures. The magnificent specimens which are ranged\r\naround worthily exemplify the rich taste and fancy which have long been\r\nconsidered a characteristic of these productions, and form a most\r\ninteresting comparison with the contents of the two succeeding Courts in\r\nthis series, where are displayed the similar productions of the English\r\nmanufactories, and, in the Ceramic Court, the richest specimens of all\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH PORCELAIN MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this Court somewhat differ in character from the works\r\nwe have just quitted, inasmuch as the English Ceramic Art-manufactures\r\nof the highest class, and Porcelain from the best English potteries,\r\nwill be found, as well as glass. The Parian statuettes, a branch of\r\nArt-manufacture of comparatively recent introduction, and in which the\r\nEnglish excel, form a very beautiful and interesting feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERAMIC COURT.\r\n\r\nThe next Court is appropriated to a most valuable collection of Ceramic\r\nproductions, illustrating the art of Pottery, from the earliest to the\r\nlatest time. This art has always been esteemed as curious and\r\ninstructive, as it is an enduring record of a nation. From the earliest\r\ntimes, specimens have come down to us, and they doubtless speak with\r\nsingular accuracy of the phase of civilisation in which they were\r\nfashioned, and of the manners which required them. Thus a survey of the\r\nCeramic Court will, it is thought, bear with it more than the mere\r\ninspection of curious, beautiful, or splendid objects affords. The\r\nspecimens are mostly arranged in the glass cases round the walls. In\r\nthese will be found some curious Mexican examples, early Greek and\r\nEtruscan, and early stone pottery, as well as articles in terra cotta.\r\nMany very fine pieces of Lustrous and Italian-painted Majolica ware are\r\narranged in the cases on the garden side of the Court. Of Sèvres china\r\nthere are several splendid pieces of the renowned jewelled ware, as well\r\nas modern productions. The Dresden, Berlin, Viennese, Chinese, and\r\nOriental manufactures are worthily illustrated, while amongst the\r\nproductions of our own country may be pointed out the specimens of early\r\nWorcester and Chelsea ware, as well as the splendid works of the most\r\nmodern manufacturers. Several of the magnificent pieces of continental\r\nmanufacture have been graciously lent for exhibition by Her Majesty the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFANCY MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\nThis is the last Industrial Court of the series on this side. It will be\r\nfound to contain a most varied and rich collection of all those\r\nessentials of use and ornament for which both the Continent and this\r\ncountry are famous, comprising articles of bijouterie, vertù, papier\r\nmaché, and an endless variety of things for presents or mementos; all\r\nthe articles being for sale on the spot.\r\n\r\nQuitting this Court, and turning to the right towards the garden, we\r\nreach the Photographic Department, entrusted to Messrs. Negretti and\r\nZambra, the photographers to the Crystal Palace Company. Photographic\r\nportraits are also taken here in a room fitted for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the series of Courts on this side, and along the whole of\r\nthis part of the garden front, is arranged an exhibition of Carriages by\r\nmost of the best makers, as well as harness, and many new inventions in\r\nconnection with these things.\r\n\r\nThe visitor, having explored all the Fine Art Courts as well as the\r\nseveral Courts of Manufacture, may now give his exclusive attention to\r\nthe _chefs-d’œuvre_ and valuable examples of ancient and modern\r\nsculpture, which he has not found in the Fine Art Courts; but which will\r\narrest his eye from point to point, as he accompanies us in a walk\r\nthrough\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAVE AND TRANSEPTS.\r\n\r\nOur starting-point shall be the screen of the kings and queens of\r\nEngland, at the south end of the building, containing casts of the regal\r\nstatues at the new Houses of Parliament, Westminster, executed by Mr.\r\nJohn Thomas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCREEN OF THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe screen itself is from the design of Mr. M. D. Wyatt, and is\r\ncharacterised by much originality and appropriateness of treatment. The\r\nseries of monarchs is placed in chronological order, commencing, on the\r\nreturn side to the left (as we face the screen), with the kings of the\r\nSaxon heptarchy; and beneath them the Saxon kings, the first on the left\r\nbeing Egbert, by whom the greater number of the petty kingdoms were\r\nfirst consolidated. The Norman series commences, on the principal front,\r\nwith William I. and his queen, above whom are the statues of St.\r\nGeorge and St. Andrew. Amongst the various rulers of the state may be\r\nnoticed as of great excellence, in that style of sculpture which has\r\nbeen termed the “Romantic,” Henry II., Berengaria, Henry V., Henry VI.,\r\nRichard III., Edward VI., Charles I., Queen Henrietta, and Cromwell;\r\nthis last was rejected by the Committee of the Houses of Parliament, but\r\nis clearly necessary for completing the historical series, which is\r\nconcluded on the return side, to the right, with the royal personages of\r\nthe reigning Guelph family, and a lower row of Saxon kings. An\r\nequestrian statue of her Majesty, by Baron Marochetti, stands here in\r\nthe centre.\r\n\r\nQuitting the screen, we are first attracted on our road by the Crystal\r\nFountain, which occupied so conspicuous a place in the Great Exhibition\r\nin Hyde Park. We will now, however, proceed on our tour, entering first\r\nthe western end of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH TRANSEPT.\r\n\r\nIt is preferable, in order not to overlook any of the important objects\r\nwhich are stored in the several Transepts, to examine each Transept\r\ncompletely, as we enter it on our interesting tour, and after passing\r\nround both ends to resume our walk in the Nave, advancing up toward the\r\nnorth end of the Palace on the left-hand side, and returning down the\r\nright-hand or garden side. Turning then to the left, we proceed round\r\nthis Transept, from left to right, noticing on our course the statues\r\nand other objects which are placed in the open space at each end. The\r\nfirst conspicuous one of these which we find is, a cast of the\r\nwell-known equestrian statue of Charles I., from the original at Charing\r\nCross. It was designed and executed, in 1633, by Hubert Le Sueur, a\r\nFrench sculptor, pupil of the celebrated John of Bologna, but was not at\r\nthe time raised on its intended site. During the civil wars, the\r\nParliament, wanting men more than statues, sold it to John Rivet, a\r\nbrazier, living in Holborn; by whom it was kept concealed until the\r\nrestoration of Charles II., when it returned again into the hands of the\r\ngovernment, and was finally erected at Charing Cross in 1674. The\r\npedestal is a work of the celebrated sculptor, Grinling Gibbons.\r\n\r\nBeyond the statue of Charles I. in the central line, is placed that of\r\nJames II. by Grinling Gibbons, cast from the original now in the court\r\nat the back of Whitehall. It is an excellent example of a\r\nportrait-statue treated in the classical style; and affords us a proof\r\nof the higher reach of Gibbons’s genius; whose well-earned reputation in\r\nthe seventeenth century, we may remark, rested more especially on his\r\nworks in ornamental carving, of which the exquisitely cut fruits,\r\nflowers, wreaths, and other ornaments on the façade of St. Paul’s,\r\nLondon, are examples.\r\n\r\nBetween these two Royal Statues is a Mosaic picture of the Ruins of\r\nPæstum, executed in modern Roman Mosaic, every shade and tint being\r\ncomposed of separate pieces of vitreous material; and in front of the\r\nstatue of James, a model of a Chinese Junk carved in ivory, which is\r\nlent to the Crystal Palace Company by Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nA selection from the best productions of various English sculptors\r\nsurrounds this portion of the Transept. At the angle is a colossal\r\nstatue of Peel by Marochetti, and between this and the Screen of Kings\r\nand Queens in the nave is the statue of the great Earl of Chatham (449),\r\nforming a portion of his monument in Westminster Abbey. It was executed\r\nby J. Bacon, R.A., a contemporary sculptor, who was celebrated for the\r\ntruth and vigour of his portraits. Bacon should also be mentioned with\r\nhonour, as one of the first native artists who founded the English\r\nschool of sculpture in the last half of the 18th century. Amongst the\r\nstatues in the Transept itself, we would notice Macdonald’s excellent\r\ncompositions of Ulysses recognised by his Dog (48), and Andromeda (47);\r\nthe very gracefully designed figure of a Bather (36), by Lawlor; and a\r\ngroup of Boys Contending for a Prize, with some other statues by the\r\nsame artist.\r\n\r\nThe statues on the north side of this end of the Transept are by Spence\r\nand Theed; amongst them will be remarked the Highland Mary (58), and the\r\nstatue of Flora (59), both by Spence; Narcissus at the Fountain (60),\r\nand Psyche (61), by Theed.\r\n\r\nAt the junction of the Transept and the Nave is placed the colossal\r\nstatue of Dr. Johnson, from his monument at St. Paul’s, the first that\r\nwas erected in that Cathedral. This portrait-statue, as well as that of\r\nChatham, is by Bacon; but composed, as will be remarked, on a\r\ndiametrically opposite principle; the great writer being half clad in a\r\nclassic toga, whilst the great statesman is brought more vividly to our\r\nminds by being represented in the costume of his period and his order.\r\n\r\nWe now cross over to that junction of the Transept and Nave, which is\r\nmarked by a colossal statue of Lessing, the great German writer; a noble\r\nand dignified portrait-statue by Rietschel of Dresden.\r\n\r\nIn this portion of the Transept are several works of the English School\r\nof Sculpture, amongst which may be particularly remarked a statue of\r\nShakspeare (407), by John Bell; the Maid of Saragossa (6b), a very\r\npicturesque and vigorous ideal figure of a heroine who has also inspired\r\nthe pencil of Wilkie; the Dorothea (5a), so well known to the public by\r\nsmall copies in Parian marble; a graceful statue of Andromeda (7), and\r\nJane Shore (6a). All these specimens of Bell’s talents are on the north\r\nside of this part of the Transept. Opposite to them, or close by, will\r\nbe found the Mercury (55), a Dancing Girl (50), by Calder Marshall,\r\nR.A.; the First Whisper of Love (49), Zephyr and Aurora (52), and an\r\nexcellent portrait-statue of Geoffrey Chaucer (53), the father of the\r\nschool of English Poetry, also by Marshall. Nearer the Nave is an ideal\r\nstatue of Shakspeare by Roubilliac, cast from the original, still\r\npreserved in the vestibule of the British Museum. The colossal statue at\r\nthe angle is that of William Huskisson (462), the first statesman to\r\npioneer the way to free trade. It is a noble work in the classic style,\r\nby Gibson. Along the centre of the Transept are placed the Eagle Slayer\r\n(6), by Bell, a work remarkable for its vigorous treatment; the\r\nwell-known and graceful composition, also by Bell, of Una and the Lion;\r\nand the fine monument erected by the good citizens of Frankfort to the\r\nmemory of the first printers, Gutenberg, Faust, and Schœffer. The\r\ncentral statue represents Gutenberg, who rests with an arm on the\r\nshoulder of each of his fellow-workmen. The original is by Baron Launitz\r\nof Frankfort, and is a creditable instance of the public spirit, which\r\ndoes not, after the lapse of centuries, forget the originators of The\r\nPress--that mighty power, which performs at this day so grand a part in\r\nthe governance and for the benefit of the civilised world, and by means\r\nof which the reader studies this record. On the right of the Gutenberg\r\nmonument is a stately equestrian statue of Francis I. by Clesinger of\r\nParis. The countenance is strikingly like the authentic portraits of the\r\nking, and well exemplifies the character of the man. In a corresponding\r\nposition on the other side is Marochetti’s statue of Richard Cœur de\r\nLion, calling to mind a curious contrast in the chivalry of the two\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nHaving now regained the Nave, we proceed along in front of the Pompeian\r\nCourt, where will be found various works mostly illustrative of modern\r\nGerman sculpture; amongst which we notice a group of Minerva protecting\r\na Warrior (162), by Blaeser, of Berlin; also a charming little\r\ncomposition, by Brugger, of a Centaur instructing the young Achilles\r\n(164). The original model of a Nymph, with an Urn (167), by Dannecker,\r\nexecuted as a fountain at Stuttgard. An allegorical figure of Medicine\r\n(171), by Hahnel of Dresden. A Violin Player, by Steinhauser (201*). Two\r\nseated statues, in the Greek style, of Thucydides and Homer (176), by\r\nMayer. A statue of a Magdalen (261), by Wagner. A very spirited group of\r\na Hunter defending his family against a Panther (264), by Widnmann of\r\nMunich. A statue of Hector (166), by Dannecker. Next to this is a pretty\r\nstatue of Diana (270), by G. G. Wolff, and near it Telephus suckled by a\r\nHind (266), with several other beautiful examples. The statue of a\r\nHunter (263) is a _chef-d’œuvre_ by Wittich. Opposite the Stationery\r\nCourt are excellent life-size statues of stags (193*), by Professor\r\nRauch, of Berlin, excellent examples of that difficult branch of the\r\nsculptor’s art--the study of animal nature; and near these, Debay’s\r\nexquisite group of the First Cradle (96), and a magnificent vase by\r\nDrake (169), with Thorwaldsen’s beautiful Venus (217) and Aurora (18),\r\nby John Gibson, R.A. The fine statues of Victory (184 to 188), by\r\nProfessor Rauch, are characteristic examples of that great sculptor’s\r\nstyle, and of the successful variety of treatment in five designs for\r\none and the same subject. And the statue of a Nymph holding a Basket of\r\nFruits and Flowers (160), by Professor Drake, is a picturesque example\r\nof the “Romantic” school of sculpture. We now approach the Great\r\nTransept, before entering which we will turn to the left and explore the\r\nopen Court which is formed at this point by the angle of the Transept\r\nwith the Nave.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANADIAN COURT.\r\n\r\nThis position has been appropriated for the display of a most\r\ninteresting collection of the staple and manufacturing products of\r\nCanada. The colonial government have undertaken to form and maintain\r\nsuch a collection as shall completely represent the commercial resources\r\nof that important colony, and have voted a sum of money for its\r\npermanent maintenance. Such an exhibition presents invaluable\r\ninformation to the intending emigrant, and to all an interesting sign of\r\nthe progress, polish, and prosperity of our brethren in the Atlantic\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nA prominent object at the further end of this Court is the noble\r\ncolossal head of Bavaria, by Ludwig Schwanthaler, of Munich, who enjoyed\r\nan European celebrity. The original bronze statue to which it belongs,\r\nerected outside the city of Munich, is fifty feet in height, the\r\npedestal on which it stands being thirty feet high. For ten years did\r\nthe great artist, weak and broken in health, still devote himself with a\r\ntrue artist’s love to the progress of his task: but he was not destined\r\nto witness its perfect completion; and when the statue of the Genius of\r\nBavaria was cast in bronze, its author had passed from amongst us. The\r\nstatue was first publicly exhibited in 1850.\r\n\r\nCorresponding in position on the side next the Nave, is another example\r\nof those embodiments of towns and nations, which are so frequently to be\r\nfound on the Continent. The present colossal statue allegorises\r\nFranconia, a province of Germany; it is characterised by much nobility\r\nof conception, and worthily sustains the reputation of the modern German\r\nsculptors. The original, by Professor Halbig, is erected at Kilheim, in\r\nBavaria.\r\n\r\nThe south wall of the Court, and the passage from it through which we\r\npass to the front of the Reading Room, will be found to be decorated by\r\nsome beautiful bas-reliefs, amongst which may be particularised,\r\nWestmacott’s Paolo and Francesca (72); Lough’s Apotheosis of Shakspeare;\r\nsome very interesting bas-reliefs by Rauch, from the tomb of Marshal\r\nBulow; they will be found on the base of the colossal head of Bavaria;\r\nand the Triumph of Alexander (226), executed by Thorwaldsen to decorate\r\nthe Pope’s palace for the reception of Napoleon I. in 1812,--one of the\r\nmost celebrated works of the great sculptor. Chantrey’s beautiful group\r\nof Sleeping Children stands in the passage, and claims special\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY READING ROOM.\r\n\r\nWithin the quadrangular area between the Canadian Court and the Central\r\nTransept, is to be found the Reading Room of the Library, which contains\r\nworks of reference for those studies and Fine Arts which are exemplified\r\nin the Crystal Palace, as well as works of high class and general\r\nliterature. The books are obtained for use in the Reading Room, by means\r\nof a small slip to be filled up from the catalogue. Round the room fit\r\nspace is allotted to publishers, on which are exhibited the title-pages\r\nand announcements of new books, the new volumes themselves being\r\nexhibited during the season for immediate reference in an open book-case\r\nin the room. The publishers’ catalogues lie upon the table. The\r\noperation of the plan also extends to Continental literature, and the\r\nannouncements of new books by Foreign publishers, as well as their\r\ncatalogues, with the books themselves, will be noticed as an interesting\r\nfeature not to be found elsewhere. A valuable Library has been already\r\nformed by the purchases of the Company, the free gifts of individuals,\r\nand by the addition of the new works which, having been exhibited by the\r\npublishers in the Room during the season, are then added to the\r\ncatalogue. Amongst several very splendid works, the magnificent gifts of\r\nboth Continental and British publishers, which enrich the Library, one\r\ndeserves special notice on account of its very great rarity and value,\r\nas well as of its beauty. This is a copy of “Das Neue Testament” which\r\nwas printed in 1851 for His Majesty the King of Prussia. As a specimen\r\nof Gothic typography the work is perhaps without a peer, while as a work\r\nof art, and a record of what can be achieved by the printing press in\r\nthese days, it is to be highly valued. Five exquisite designs from the\r\nrich and original pencil of Kaulbach illustrate the volume; they\r\nrepresent the Deity, and the four Evangelists, severally, being single\r\nallegorical figures. There is also one illustration to the Revelations,\r\nby Peter Cornelius. These are printed from wood blocks. Twenty-five\r\ncopies only of the book were printed when the type was broken up. Of\r\nthese, five exist in England. One in the possession of Her Majesty the\r\nQueen, to whom the work is dedicated, one in the Bodleian Library at\r\nOxford, one in the Syndicate Library at Cambridge, one presented to the\r\nBishop of London, by Prince Frederick William, on the occasion of the\r\nrecent Royal Marriage, and the present copy. This magnificent volume is\r\nthe production of Herr Rudolf Decker of Berlin, Printer to the King of\r\nPrussia, by whom it was presented to the Company’s Library. In that\r\nportion of the room devoted to news, more than 100 _newspapers_ can be\r\nfound, upwards of fifty of which are London papers; the British country\r\npress is very completely represented, constituting a feature of the\r\nRoom, and several leading Foreign Journals are supplied; there are 18\r\nMagazines, and 7 Reviews (as well Foreign as English), besides\r\nPeriodicals and Pamphlets, Directories, Gazetteers, Maps, &c. &c. The\r\nvery latest news, by special telegraph, is exhibited immediately on its\r\nreceipt, and a regular Daily Telegram is received from Paris, with the\r\nstate of the French Funds, and Money Market. A Register for\r\nAppointments and Messages is kept, and a glass case in which unclaimed\r\nletters, and letters for visitors, are exhibited. There is a postage-box\r\nupon the reading-table, and one outside, from which letters are\r\ncollected several times in the course of the day; and paper, envelopes,\r\nand postage-stamps can always be obtained from the attendants at a\r\nmoderate charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT CENTRAL TRANSEPT.\r\n\r\nPassing along in front of the Reading Room, we return to the Nave, and\r\nenter the Transept, the arch of which rises nearly 175 feet high in a\r\nlight and graceful span. From the first terrace, however, to the summit\r\nof the Transept is 197 feet 10 inches. There are five galleries here,\r\none above the other, the topmost of which runs entirely round the\r\nTransept, and the third of which extends round the whole length of the\r\nbuilding on each side. In the second of these galleries, on the garden\r\nside, is the Industrial Museum and Technological Collection, of which we\r\nshall treat presently.\r\n\r\nNot far from the angle of the Transept and Nave, towards the Stationery\r\nCourt, stands a cast from the colossal statue of Rubens, by Geefs, of\r\nBrussels, erected in the cathedral square at Antwerp, of which city\r\nRubens was a native: the original is in bronze, and a fine example of\r\nthe modern Romantic school of sculpture. Opposite the statue of Rubens,\r\non the other side of the Nave, is placed a cast of the fine bronze\r\nstatue, by Dantan, which has been erected at Dieppe, in honour of the\r\ngreat French Admiral Duquesne. It is remarkable for its noble\r\nexpression, and the spirited romance of its treatment. The celebrated\r\nFarnese Hercules and the Farnese Flora, both colossal antique statues\r\nfrom the Museum at Naples, occupy the corresponding positions across the\r\nTransept. The Hercules is a fine and artistic example, characterised by\r\na massive and somewhat exaggerated muscular development, not, however,\r\naltogether inappropriate to the hero of physical force. The whole of\r\nthis the western end of the Great Transept is occupied by the great\r\norchestra, capable of accommodating 4,000 performers, which has been\r\nerected for the Great Handel Festival. In the centre of the orchestra is\r\nthe great organ which has been built by Messrs. Gray and Davison\r\nexpressly for the position.[26] The eastern end of the Transept is\r\noccupied by a handsome orchestra for musical and choral performances. On\r\nthe northern side of this end of the Great Transept are ranged some\r\nchoice statues of the modern schools; the graceful Amalthæa by Julien\r\n(113); Psyche (103*); Veritas (150), a veiled figure by Monti; and\r\nEndymion (129), the Graces (125), and Paris (129), by the late famous\r\nsculptor Canova.\r\n\r\n  [26] The organ contains 66 stops, viz., 20 on the great organ, 12 on\r\n  the choir, 5 on the solo, 17 on the swell, and 12 on the pedals. It\r\n  has four separate rows of keys, with couplers, combination pedals, and\r\n  complete pedal board. The instrument contains 4568 sounding-pipes.\r\n\r\nWe must now cross over the Nave and enter the open court, which is close\r\nto the colossal Farnese Hercules, and which corresponds in position to\r\nthe Canadian Court, which we examined before entering the Transept. This\r\nCourt is filled with specimens of antique sculpture of the Greek and\r\nRoman schools. Among these we would draw attention to the colossal\r\nVelletri Pallas (351), so called from having been discovered at\r\nVelletri, near Rome, and now preserved in the Louvre, at Paris; the\r\nDying Gladiator (309); a Boy with a Dolphin; a colossal head of Pallas\r\n(328). A Boy extracting a Thorn from his Foot, from the Capitoline\r\nMuseum at Rome; and the fine head of Antoninus Pius (381).\r\n\r\nA collection of Greek ideal and portrait-busts will also be noticed in\r\nthis Court; amongst which the colossal heads of Vespasian (332), Trajan\r\n(354), Pertinax (379), Lucius Verus (361), and Titus (333), are\r\nparticularly deserving of notice. The visitor should not quit this\r\ncompartment without noticing the collection of antique vases which it\r\ncontains, amongst which the Medicean Vase (343) is a peculiarly elegant\r\nexample of antique art. The elegant tripod (211), and the antique\r\nfountain (357), are also worthy of attention. Here also we find the\r\ncelebrated group known as the Toro Farnese, or Farnese Bull. The\r\noriginal of this beautiful group, which is now preserved in the Museum\r\nat Naples, was discovered in the Baths of Caracalla at Rome, and derives\r\nits name from having been placed in the Farnese Palace in that city. The\r\nsubject is the revenge of Queen Antiope and her two sons, Zethus and\r\nAmphion, on Dirce, for seducing the affections of her husband, Syeres,\r\nKing of Thebes. The sons, enraged at the insult offered to their mother,\r\nare represented as about to revenge themselves by tying the unfortunate\r\nDirce to the horns of a bull, when their mother, moved with womanly\r\npity, intercedes for her rival, and induces them to forego the intended\r\npunishment. According to Pliny, the Toro Farnese was the work of the\r\nRhodian artists, Apollonius and Tauriseus.\r\n\r\nConspicuous also in this compartment, from its high position and great\r\nbeauty, is the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. This beautiful example\r\nof ancient Greek architecture is usually styled the Lantern of\r\nDemosthenes, on account of a tradition which ascribes its erection to\r\nthat celebrated orator. No weight, however, can be attached to this\r\nsupposition, although it may be, and in all probability is, due to the\r\ntime of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nAn inscription on the architrave informs us that this monument was\r\nerected by Lysicrates of Kikyna, at his own expense, in order to\r\ncommemorate a musical triumph obtained by various members of his tribe\r\nor clan, the Akamantis. The ancient Greeks were in the habit of holding\r\na species of musical tournament, in which the most celebrated masters of\r\nthe art vied with each other; in this particular case, the palm was\r\nawarded to Theon, the flute-player, and the chorus of boys led by\r\nLysiades; the magistrate for the year being Evanectus. It was to\r\ncelebrate this triumph that the monument was erected. On the monument\r\nwas sculptured the story of Bacchus transforming the Tyrrhenian pirates\r\ninto dolphins, which was the subject of the music. A tripod was the\r\nusual prize granted in these contests, and the victor either placed it\r\nin one of the temples, or, as in the present instance, consecrated a\r\nmonument specially for its reception. It was placed on the summit.\r\n\r\nRetracing our steps, we once more regain the Nave, and as we advance,\r\nstill keeping on the left side, past the front of the Egyptian Court, we\r\nremark several antique statues, including the Antinous as Mercury, from\r\nthe Capitol at Rome (316), the Antinous as a Good Genius (314), and the\r\nAdonis, from Capua (213).\r\n\r\nFrom this point, extending throughout the façade of the Greek Court, are\r\nranged excellent examples of Greek sculpture, which the visitor may\r\ncompare with the subsequent works of the Roman sculptors, or of Greeks\r\nsettled at Rome, placed before the walls of the Roman Court. Amongst the\r\nGreek statues we select the group of Silenus and a youthful Bacchus\r\n(306), excellently treated and full of life; seated statues of\r\nDemosthenes the Philosopher (308), and of Posidonius (307), on each side\r\nof the first entrance to the Court; the Borghese Silenus (306); a\r\nBacchus and Faun (305); the fine group of the Wrestlers, from Florence\r\n(304), the well-known Drunken Faun (295), from the Museum at Naples; and\r\nthe Apollo Sauroctonos (298), from the Vatican. Nor must we omit the\r\nexcellent seated statues (290, 291). On either side of the principal\r\nentrance to the Greek Court will be found the beautiful Ceres (130), a\r\nVestal (142), the Amazon (302), and Polymnia (297).\r\n\r\nIn front of the Roman Court will be first noticed Meleager and his Dog\r\n(289); the celebrated Antinous (288); the fine Mercury, from the Vatican\r\n(287), and the same subject (288), from Naples. Before the first\r\nentrance to the Court are placed the seated statues of Trajan (286), and\r\nAgrippina (281).\r\n\r\nThe Mercury disguised as a Shepherd (285), and the Adonis (282), are\r\ncharacteristic specimens of the ordinary Roman style.\r\n\r\nPassing the façade of the Alhambra Court, we arrive at the Fountains,\r\nwhich at this end of the Nave correspond to those of the south end in\r\nposition, and generally with respect to the aquatic plants which live in\r\nthe water of the long basin. The two fountains here are designed and\r\nexecuted by Monti the sculptor. The figures of Syrens, supporting the\r\nlarge shells, typify by their colour four races of men: the Caucasian,\r\nwhite; the Nubian, black; the North American Indian, red; and the\r\nAustralian, olive. The smaller figures above these bear fruit indigenous\r\nto various soils. The design of the Fountains is most appropriate, and\r\nthe entire composition very artistic. The bronze colour of these\r\nstatues, and of many others in the building, is produced by means of the\r\nelectrotype process, with signal success. In the water which surrounds\r\nthis fountain many interesting plants will be found, in addition to the\r\nlilies and other varieties which adorn the basin of the Crystal Fountain\r\nat the south end of the Nave. The Papyrus plant will be recognised by\r\nits tall green stems topped with fibrous leaves. The manuscripts of the\r\nEgyptians and many ancient nations were inscribed upon sheets made from\r\nthe stalks of this plant. Many of the Egyptian architectural ornaments\r\nare derived from the form of the Papyrus, which grows in large\r\nquantities along the banks of the Nile. Rice, sugar-canes, and other\r\ninteresting plants, grow along the margin of the water; the most curious\r\nof which, as indeed it is one of the rarest in the whole collection, is\r\nthe Lattice Plant. This specimen was but lately brought from Madagascar\r\nby the Rev. Mr. Ellis. The remarkable form of the plant, from which it\r\nis named, will ensure its easy recognition. The gold fish, of which\r\nthere are many thousands in the fountain basins of the Nave, have all\r\nbeen bred there from a few fish which have now grown to a great size,\r\nand may often be noticed steadily sailing amongst their multitudinous\r\nprogeny. The temperature of the water, which is heated by water pipes\r\nbeneath the surface, is peculiarly favourable to the growth of these\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH TRANSEPT, AND TROPICAL END OF THE BUILDING.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that the valuable collection of Palms and other\r\nspecimens of Eastern vegetation, which have been collected in this\r\nTransept and beyond, could only be kept healthy by isolating the\r\ndepartment devoted to them, and raising its temperature to a degree\r\nwhich would not be pleasant in all parts of the building, or favourable\r\nto the equable growth and seasonable cultivation of the other various\r\nbotanical specimens. During the greater part of the season, a curtain\r\ndivides this portion of the Palace from the more temperate regions. The\r\ntemperature suits so well the plants that some, which on their arrival\r\nappeared not to grow well, have become quite acclimated, wearing a rich\r\nand luxuriant growth of verdure.\r\n\r\nHaving entered the North Transept, we find the whole of the western end\r\noccupied by the colossal Egyptian Figures from Aboo Simbel. We shall\r\nview these to the best advantage from the further end of the Transept,\r\nin front of the Mammoth Tree; we will, therefore, first make the circuit\r\nof the fountain, examining the surrounding objects, and inspect them\r\nfrom that point, and thence commence our return journey down the Nave.\r\n\r\nThe two semicircular extensions at this the upper end of the fountain\r\nbasin have been separated from the main body of the water by a\r\nperforated partition, and contain some curious and interesting animals.\r\nIn that to the right, or immediately in front of the Assyrian Court,\r\nsports one of the most remarkable of the animal creation--the\r\n_Lepidosiren_. It is remarkable as being an animal organised with both\r\n_lungs_ and _gills_, which are generally assumed to be distinctive\r\norganizations in the reptile and the fish; but this, it will be seen,\r\nlike most of such wonders in natural history, is a conformation of the\r\nanimal to its habits of subsistence, place of residence, and the\r\nexigencies of its life. It is found in the river Gambia, in Western\r\nAfrica. During a great portion of the year this river is dried up, and\r\nthe mud in its bed is baked under an ardent tropical sun till it is of\r\nimmense hardness, and shines when cut with a knife. When the river\r\nsubsides, and parches up, the Lepidosiren burrows into the mud, where it\r\nremains during the dry period, till when the rains come, and the river\r\nswells, it issues from the softened mud and sports in the water again.\r\nIt is considered by the most able naturalists to belong to the reptilia\r\nrather than the fish. The exact nature of its food is not accurately\r\nknown, but it is a voracious feeder on animal substances; this specimen\r\nregales himself upon raw beef, frogs, and snails, with the occasional\r\ndelicacy of a gold fish. He is himself eaten as a delicacy by people in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nIn the corresponding compartment on the other side of the basin are two\r\nspecies of fresh-water tortoises, _Emys Caspia_ and _Emys Gambiensis_,\r\none an European and one an African species, which may be identified by\r\nits larger size and lighter colour. The _Emys Caspia_ is found commonly\r\nin the rivers of most of the warmer countries in Europe. When, after the\r\nCrimean war, the troops garrisoning the Ionian Islands returned to\r\nEngland, one of the officers brought with him two eggs of this variety;\r\nfor safety he put them into his pistol-case. On his arrival in England\r\nthe eggs were found to be hatched, and the two small animals were\r\npresented to the Crystal Palace Company, and placed in this basin. One\r\nhas since died, after living some months; the other is still here.\r\n\r\nThe Visitor should not omit to inspect the Aviaries, of which there are\r\nseveral, in this end of the building. These contain Weaver Birds,\r\nGrenadiers, Grosbeaks, Mocking Birds, and Paroquets, most of them\r\ninhabitants of warm climates. There are also some Nightingales, whose\r\nrich song is frequently heard, even when the people crowd round them.\r\nThe Weaver Birds, in the spring, may be seen constructing their\r\ncuriously woven nests of grass, which hang from the branches like so\r\nmany stockings; others of the feathered tribe build their habitations\r\nfearlessly in the presence of the visitor, with all the art of the\r\nbasket-maker; here, indeed, bird-architecture of the most unique kind\r\nmay be studied by the naturalist with delight and advantage. The\r\nAustralian Paroquets have this spring again reared their young in these\r\nAviaries with great success. It has been generally supposed that it was\r\nnot possible to induce these birds to rear their young in this climate;\r\nbut in 1856, the experiment was most successfully carried out in this\r\nAviary. It has been repeated here since, each year; and in the present\r\nspring (1859), there are two healthy young birds which have been hatched\r\nin one nest, and there is promise of others. These observations more\r\nespecially apply to the large species of Ground-paroquet (Platycercus\r\nhermalonotus), the smaller Shell-paroquet (Melopsittacus undulatus)\r\nhaving repeatedly bred in this country.\r\n\r\nBesides the birds mentioned, there are several of the British varieties,\r\nas well as some others of greater rarity or interest which may be\r\nspecially mentioned. There are several Canaries which should be noticed,\r\nas they have been trapped in the Islands and forwarded direct, in their\r\nwild state. These must not, however, be confounded with those of the\r\ntame varieties in the same Aviary; they may be distinguished readily\r\nnot only by the general carriage of the bird, but by their green\r\nplumage. The collection of Sparrows is also interesting: there are the\r\ncommon house and tree Sparrows of England (this last, however, is not to\r\nbe confounded with the Hedge-sparrow), the Rice-sparrow of Java, and the\r\nDiamond-sparrow of Australia. The Diamond and Java Sparrows have\r\nsuccessfully constructed nests; which is an additional evidence of how\r\nsuitable the Tropical end of the Crystal Palace is for the Tropical\r\nbirds. Here also are two or three specimens of the Californian Quail\r\n(Ortyx Californicus). These birds were brought from the Zoological\r\nGardens at Antwerp. They breed freely, and are well adapted to thrive in\r\na wild state in this climate, rearing from fifteen to twenty young ones\r\nin a brood; they are a great table delicacy, and it is probable at no\r\ndistant period may enrich the list of British Game birds.\r\n\r\nIn a glass case, on the right hand as we approach the Aviaries, are some\r\nbeautiful and interesting Lizards (Lacerta agilis). These perfectly\r\nharmless little reptiles are found in all the warm parts of Europe,\r\nfrequenting dry, stony places, and old ruined buildings. Their food is\r\nflies, beetles, moths, and other like insects. The present specimens are\r\nfrom Guernsey, in which island they greatly abound.\r\n\r\nNear to these, in the centre of the Transept, are some of the most\r\ncurious of the reptiles, and which are perhaps better known by repute\r\nthan even the most common species daily under our feet. These are the\r\nChameleons. The changes of colour in this animal, so often spoken of,\r\nare not generally so rapid as is supposed, nor do they possess so great\r\ndistinctions as are popularly ascribed to them. In all their habits they\r\nare so slow as to be generally almost immovable, save in respect of\r\ntheir restless eyes, and the tongue, which is very long and adapted\r\npeculiarly to its purpose, which is to secure their food; they can dart\r\nit with almost invisible rapidity upon a passing fly or insect, which is\r\nimmediately thus drawn into the mouth. They appear most generally to\r\nassimilate their colour to the objects on which they rest, or which\r\nsurround them. This may be a means of protection to them, but it is most\r\nprobably only a method of concealment for the more effectual capture of\r\ntheir prey. It, however, answers the double purpose.\r\n\r\nIf we now proceed by the extreme end of the building toward the eastern\r\nend of the North Transept, we shall find both on our right and left hand\r\na complete set of casts from the Ægina Marbles.\r\n\r\nThese most interesting monuments of ancient Greek art are now in the\r\nGlyptothek at Munich.\r\n\r\nThey were discovered in the Island of Ægina, and are supposed to have\r\nornamented the tympana of the east and west fronts of the temple of\r\nMinerva in that island. The group, representing the Contest over the\r\nBody of Patroclus, belonged to the western, and the five figures\r\ndescriptive of the Battle of Hercules and Telamon against the Trojan\r\nking Laomedon, were in the eastern tympanum. They are most remarkable\r\nexamples of Greek sculpture during its second period, or from the close\r\nof the 6th to the middle of the 5th century B.C.\r\n\r\nThe conception, the anatomy, and beauty of form found in these statues\r\ndenote a highly cultivated artistic taste and power, to which the\r\npeculiar faces, the invariable smile on the mouth, and a certain stiff\r\nangularity of treatment, form a marked contrast. We observe in them that\r\nturning-point in the history of Greek sculpture, when the\r\nconventionalities of an earlier system were receding before that love of\r\nnature and extraordinary perception of the Beautiful, which subsequently\r\nrendered the Greeks so pre-eminent in art.\r\n\r\nThe originals, which had, as may be supposed, suffered considerably from\r\nthe effects of time, were restored by Thorwaldsen, the Dane, whose\r\nconscientious spirit and thorough appreciation of the antique give\r\nassurance of the correctness of the interesting examples now before us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LECTURE ROOM.\r\n\r\nThrough the doorway which is in the corner to the right of the first set\r\nof Ægina marbles, is fitted up a spacious Lecture Room, with every\r\naccommodation for Dissolving Views and other illustrations. It comprises\r\nthe whole of the “Queen’s Corridor,” so called from the private\r\napartments of Her Majesty, which are to the left.\r\n\r\nContinuing onwards, we obtain a fine view of the North Transept, with\r\nits noble avenue of sphinxes and palm-trees, terminating with\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLOSSAL EGYPTIAN FIGURES,\r\n\r\nwhich are from the temple of Rameses the Great at Aboo Simbel, in Nubia.\r\nThese immense seated statues towering to the roof of the Transept afford\r\nus some adequate idea of the stupendous magnitude and passive grandeur\r\nwhich characterise the monuments of ancient Egyptian art. Their height\r\nis sixty-five feet.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that in the Egyptian Court we directed the\r\nattention of the visitor to a model of the temple at Aboo Simbel; on the\r\nfaçade of which were four statues of Rameses the Great. Two of these\r\nstatues are here reproduced on the scale of the originals, the smaller\r\nfigures around them representing the mother, wife, and daughter of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Aboo Simbel, in Nubia, is excavated from the rock, and was\r\nfirst discovered by Burckhardt, the traveller; the accumulated sand of\r\ncenturies, which then covered it, was removed by order of Belzoni, the\r\nfirst, with Captains Irby and Mangles, to pass its long-closed entrance.\r\nThe interior was covered with paintings and hieroglyphics relating to\r\nRameses the Great, and the date of the temple has been consequently\r\nplaced at about 1560 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe sphinxes which formed the avenue are cast from one preserved in the\r\nLouvre, the writing engraved on which presents us with a curious but not\r\nuncommon instance of a custom that prevailed amongst the Egyptian\r\nmonarchs, and to which we referred when describing the Egyptian Court.\r\nOn one side of the shoulder the name “Pthalomen Miotph” is written in\r\nhieroglyphics, and on the other shoulder is the name of Shishak I. The\r\nlast-named lived about 1000 B.C., and the first nearly two hundred years\r\nbefore him. Other instances occur where the name of the original founder\r\nhas been erased altogether, in order to make way for the name of some\r\ncomparatively modern king.\r\n\r\nWe are now standing at the foot of what represents one of the\r\nlargest-known trees in the world. This tree grew, one of a group of such\r\nmonsters, on the Sierra Nevada in California. When flourishing, it rose\r\nto the astounding height of nearly 400 feet. Several in the same\r\ndistrict which are now standing are 300 feet in height. The bark of this\r\ntree has been arranged and fitted up as it grew, to give us some idea of\r\nits gigantic proportions by the view of a part. The wood is a\r\nparticularly light cedar; and has been considered as of the same kind as\r\nthat cedar of Lebanon employed by Solomon in the building of the Jewish\r\ntemple. Dr. Lindley has named it the _Wellingtonia gigantea_, and has\r\nfixed its age at 4000 years. This then must have been a great tree\r\nbefore the ancient rock tombs of Aboo Simbel were hewn for the great\r\nRameses.\r\n\r\nLeaving the fountain on our right, we arrive almost immediately in front\r\nof the Byzantine Court, where, resting beneath the foliage, are eight\r\neffigies of knights from the Temple Church, London. They are clad, with\r\none exception, in ring-mail, and afford us perfect representations of\r\nmilitary costume in the early part of the 13th century. They are usually\r\ncalled the Knights Templar; but without evidence: the cross-legged\r\nstatues are probably crusaders. The entire series has been carefully\r\nrestored by Mr. Richardson. The first two statues in front of the German\r\nMediæval Court, as we face the entrance, are fine examples of German\r\nGothic sculpture, from Cologne and Nuremberg: the three subjects beyond\r\nthem are from Langen Church, Germany. The two first statues on our right\r\nare from the façade of Wells Cathedral, and next to them are various\r\nexamples of German sculpture. Facing the English Mediæval Court, will be\r\nnoticed, on each side of the entrance, the effigies of Bishop Kilkenny\r\nfrom Ely Cathedral, Henry III. from Westminster, and of Longespée from\r\nSalisbury Cathedral: the two last being especially interesting monuments\r\nof the 13th century.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the entrance, and nearest to the Nave, are two statues\r\nfrom Wells Cathedral, noticeable as fine examples of Early English\r\nsculpture, and the effigy of Bishop Northwold from Ely. Nearer the\r\nfaçade is placed the remarkable effigy of Queen Philippa, the wife of\r\nEdward III., from Westminster Abbey, belonging to the last half of the\r\n14th century. Beyond this again, will be noticed the effigy from\r\nSalisbury Cathedral, of Bishop Poer, who died in 1228, one of the\r\nearliest monumental statues in England. In front of the façade of the\r\nFrench Mediæval Court, will be found several pieces of Gothic sculpture\r\nof the early period of the Pointed style, from Chartres Cathedral; on\r\nthe right of the entrance from the Nave are placed the busts of Henry\r\nII. and Diana of Poictiers, Henry III., Bayard and Louis XII., and\r\nnearer to the Nave will be seen the Virgin “de Trumeau,” from Notre\r\nDame, at Paris; and a fine picturesque bronze statue of a knight from\r\nthe monument of Maximilian, of Innspruck, in the Austrian Tyrol, a\r\nremarkable work of art, executed by native artists in the early part of\r\nthe 16th century. Close to this is placed the fine bronze statue of\r\nAlbert of Bavaria, from the tomb of Lewis of Bavaria, at Munich,\r\nremarkable as serving to illustrate the very rich and characteristic\r\ncostume of the close of the 16th century. Opposite to it is the very\r\nfine St. George, by Donatello, from Florence, one of the master-pieces\r\nof that celebrated sculptor, whilst another Innspruck statue occupies a\r\nposition nearer the Nave. Advancing onwards, still in front of the\r\nRenaissance Court, we recognise amongst the busts, those of Francis I.,\r\nSully, and Henry IV. of France, Shakspeare, Machiavelli, Ben Jonson,\r\nCosmo de’ Medici, and Lord Bacon. The bronze statues on each side of the\r\npath are from the Tartarughe fountain, at Rome, the extreme figure being\r\nthe celebrated Bacchus, by Michael Angelo. Amongst the works of Italian\r\nart placed in front of the Italian Court, we remark the Bacchus by\r\nSansovino, from Florence, the Triton from the gardens of the Doria\r\npalace, Genoa, the Tartarughe statues from Rome, and at the angle, in\r\nfront of the Italian vestibule, the beautiful statue of Mercury, by John\r\nof Bologna, a _chef-d’œuvre_ of the 16th century school. Among the busts\r\nwill be remarked those of Raffaelle and Michael Angelo, Inigo Jones,\r\nMazarin, Richelieu, Charles I., and other celebrities of the Renaissance\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nA little further on in front of the Court of Monuments of Art, we remark\r\ntwo statues of Perseus; one by Cellini, and the other by Canova. That by\r\nCellini is characterised by a grandeur of conception and power of\r\nexecution, which place his name among those of the greatest sculptors of\r\nhis day. Cellini’s description of the casting of this statue is, in the\r\nhighest degree, interesting. Not having sufficient metal to complete it,\r\nhe threw into the furnace his metal dishes and porringers, amounting to\r\nupwards of two hundred; after offering up a prayer to heaven in company\r\nwith his workmen, he uncovered his statue and found it thoroughly cast,\r\nwith the exception of one foot. The plaster cast in the Crystal Palace\r\nis, we believe, the only one in the world, and was obtained through the\r\nliberality of the Duke of Sutherland, the owner of the only bronze cast\r\nof the original, which stands in the grand square at Florence.\r\n\r\nWe now cross the Central Transept, still keeping to the left hand or\r\ngarden side of the Nave. At the angle of the Transept will be found the\r\nConcert Room, for the special performance of vocal, chamber, and\r\nclassical music. The room is quadrangular, but open towards the Nave,\r\nand on three sides is surrounded by galleries. The space appropriated to\r\nvisitors on the ground floor, and which is fitted with seats, is 96 feet\r\nsquare, and with the galleries is capable of accommodating about 3000\r\npeople. The Orchestra, built on the garden side of the room, will easily\r\naccommodate 60 performers.\r\n\r\nAround the outside of the Concert Room will be found many most\r\ninteresting busts belonging to the Portrait Gallery, mostly of the\r\nillustrious men and women of France. Amongst them we remark Jean Goujon\r\n(196), Félibien (203), Rachel (216), Corneille (218), Lafontaine (220\r\na), Molière (221), Racine (225), Voltaire (233), Le Sage (230), Buffon\r\n(245), Cuvier (256), Bayard (257), Gaston (258), Coligny (260), Turenne\r\n(266), Massena (279), Ney (283); busts of nearly all the generals and\r\nstatesmen of the Consulate and Empire, and of the leading men of the\r\nRepublic of 1848; three busts of Napoleon Buonaparte, which may be\r\nadvantageously compared together, and the present Emperor Louis Napoleon\r\n(312). Close to this compartment is one of Mr. Rimmel’s fountains,\r\nexecuted from a design by Mr. John Thomas. The crystal basin, Parian\r\nmarble figures, ebony pedestal, and natural flowers, harmonise\r\nexcellently. Similar scent fountains, designed with great taste by the\r\nsame artist, and supplied by Mr. Rimmel, will be found in the North and\r\nSouth Transepts.\r\n\r\nQuitting the Concert Room, we continue our examination of the statues,\r\nwhich extend along this side of the Nave. The most notable of the\r\nsucceeding subjects are the Prodigal Son (145), by San Giorgio; David\r\n(147), by Magni, an artist whose studies of every-day life are\r\nremarkable for their truth to nature; Cain (99), by Etex; Geefs’s\r\nMalibran (108); a colossal group of the Murder of the Innocents (142);\r\nan Italian Mower; the Horse and Dead Knight (46), by Lough; Sampson, by\r\nLegrew; and also the charming statues of Eve, and Eve Listening, by\r\nBailey. On our way towards the Queen’s screen we pass several works of\r\nstatuary art, amongst which may be noticed, A Faun with Cymbals (66), by\r\nR. Westmacott, R.A., and a David (67*), by the same sculptor; an Ancient\r\nBriton as a Scout, and the Massacre of the Innocents, by J. E. Adams,\r\nand a fine statue of Erato (174), by Launitz.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOTANY OF THE PALACE.\r\n\r\nHowever beautiful and perfect may be the works of art by which we are\r\nsurrounded, there is a Hand whose meanest work outvies them all, yet\r\nwhose silent and beneficent wonders are going on around us. To the\r\nunobservant man nature is silent. He knows not the rich treasure he\r\nneglects, and the eloquent teachings, the more loved the more they are\r\nknown, which he never listens to. Of all nature’s developments, perhaps\r\nnot one is so universal or so important as that of which we are now\r\ngoing to treat. The character, the habits, the civilisation, almost the\r\nvery existence of men is determined by the vegetation of the countries\r\nthey inhabit, and where no vegetation is, the land is desert indeed. Our\r\nkindliest memories of foreign lands, and of our own country’s beautiful\r\nspots, are inseparably linked with the foliage and verdure which adorns\r\nthe rugged earth, and is, as it were, the handwriting of the Almighty’s\r\nblessing and distinction. It is not the burning sun alone that makes the\r\ntropical island appear so different to our own: there seems a wider\r\ndifference still, between the rank and tangled luxuriance of the\r\ntropical forest, and the stately glades of England--or between the\r\nprodigal wealth of almost wild fertility, and the field surrounded by\r\nhedgerows, whose riches are the reward of patient and necessary\r\ncultivation. There is indeed beautiful instruction in all nature’s\r\nphases and mysteries, but none more beautiful than that conveyed by\r\nplants and flowers. The greatest minds have turned their strength to the\r\nculture of the field or garden, and the gentlest and best hearts seem to\r\nbe the most fitting home for the love of beauty so pure and true.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in the pages of this book to do more than point out\r\nsome of the most interesting and beautiful of the specimens which\r\nconstitute the rich botanical collection of the Crystal Palace. Amongst\r\nsuch a multitude of examples many of the greatest interest necessarily\r\nfind no mention here, but they are not the less to be observed. The\r\nsmallest and most unobtrusive plant may be the most worthy of notice,\r\nand in its relations with human life the most deadly, the most\r\nmedicinal, or the most grateful. The history and attributes of almost\r\nevery one will lead us on a course fraught with knowledge, and a\r\npleasure which study unveils more and more.\r\n\r\nThe Borders, which range along each side of the Nave fronting the\r\nfaçades of the various Courts, are all numbered, as will be seen by a\r\nreference to the plan. The South and North Transepts are filled with\r\ntrees and flowers. The divisions of the Natural History Illustrations\r\nare also filled with examples to represent, as much as possible, the\r\nflora of the various countries. We propose to accompany the visitor from\r\nBorder No. 1, close to the Screen of Kings and Queens, and following the\r\narrangement of the Borders up this, the South-Western side of the\r\nPalace, to return on the opposite or garden side.\r\n\r\nIn Border No. 1, we first notice an example of one of the finest and\r\nlargest timber trees of New Zealand, the native name of which is the\r\nKakaterre (_Dacrydium taxifolium_). This is a tree of giant growth. Just\r\nbeyond the statue of Chatham are two specimens of the _Melaleuca_, some\r\nof the species of which furnish the Australian aborigines with a kind of\r\ntea; this beautiful species of tree is almost exclusively peculiar to\r\nAustralia, and contributes much to form the character of Australian\r\nvegetation. Against the Column, and adjacent in this Border, are also\r\nseveral fine plants, some of which are 30 feet high, of the Australian\r\nAcacia (_Acacia foliosa_). The early foliage of this tree, it is\r\ninteresting to observe, is characterised by a larger development than it\r\nassumes with more advanced growth; these differences can easily be\r\ndistinguished in the plants before us, which may be identified by their\r\nlight-coloured and elegant leaves. Another large Acacia (_Melanoxylon_)\r\nis near the angle of the South Transept, and on the left of it perhaps\r\none of the finest specimens of the _Rhododendron arboreum_ from Nepaul.\r\nThis magnificent tree was one of the first of this species sent out\r\nafter its introduction into this country, and when only five inches high\r\nwas purchased for five guineas. It bears rich scarlet flowers.\r\n\r\nTurning now into the South Transept, one of the first specimens we\r\nnotice, in Border No. 3, is a noble tree of the _Camellia reticulata_,\r\nperhaps the finest kind ever introduced of this magnificent flower; it\r\nis indigenous to China and Japan. Beyond this, as we pass from left to\r\nright down the Transept, is a tree of the New Zealand Spruce (_Dacrydium\r\ncupressimum_), whose delicate form and drooping foliage claim\r\nadmiration; and almost behind this is a most interesting specimen of the\r\nParaguay Tea Tree (_Ilex Paraguayensis_). The Maté, a curious Brazilian\r\ntea, is obtained from the prepared leaves of this plant. Immediately\r\nsucceeding this in our course is the Camphor-tree (Cinnamomum camphora),\r\nfrom which the valuable drug of commerce is procured. This specimen is\r\nfrom China, but it also grows in Japan. Passing on a few steps, we find\r\nthe _Ceratonia Siliqua_. This plant is eminently curious, as being that\r\nwhich bears the “locusts” on which it is presumed St. John fed, as\r\nmentioned in the Gospel; it has thus obtained the name of “St. John’s\r\nBread.” The last great tree in this border is a magnificent Norfolk\r\nIsland Pine (_Araucaria excelsa_), 40 feet high. This stately and\r\nbeautiful tree grows in its own country to the height of 200 feet. On\r\nthe other side of the Transept, in Border No. 5, which we now proceed to\r\ninspect, will be found a corresponding specimen, and many of the same\r\nkinds of plants as those we have just examined; but we may notice here,\r\nalmost in the centre, a noble specimen of a beautiful new Fuchsia,\r\ncalled _Dominiana_; behind which may be seen the largest tree in this\r\ncountry of that species of Camellia known as “Lady Hume’s Blush.” In the\r\ncentre of the Transept is placed a gigantic specimen of the American\r\nAloe, which, for its magnificence of growth, is perhaps unequalled in\r\nthis country. This specimen was brought in 1828, a small plant, from the\r\nruins of the palace of the Cæsars at Rome, where it grew wild.\r\n\r\nWe now resume our tour up the Nave with Border No. 7. At this corner\r\nstands a most elegant and beautiful tree, the _Acacia dealbata_, a\r\nnative of New Holand. This tree is perhaps the finest of its kind to be\r\nfound in the kingdom. In the centre of this border rises a rare specimen\r\nof the _Yucca stricta_; its beautifully variegated and lance-shaped\r\nleaves constitute it a prominent object easy of recognition. Close to\r\nthe column, a little further on, is the _Aralia trifoliata_, from New\r\nZealand; a plant which possesses the peculiarity of shortening its\r\ncuriously-formed leaf as its age advances.\r\n\r\nSurrounding the Pompeian Court at the back of these borders, are\r\nspecimens of the Azalea. On either side of the entrance to this Court\r\nare luxuriant Orange-trees, and near to them some Citron-trees.\r\n\r\nIn Border 7 _a_, at which we have now arrived, is a beautiful tree,\r\ncalled the _Araucaria Bidwillii_, the rigid foliage of which much\r\nresembles the imbricated Pine of Chili. The aborigines of Australia make\r\na favourite article of food of the seeds from the large cones of this\r\ntree, which attain the size of a child’s head. But one of the most\r\nprominent of the trees in this compartment stands a little nearer the\r\ncolumn. This is the Bottle-Brush plant of Australia, and when in bloom\r\nwith its red bosses of flowers, from which it has been named, it bears a\r\nvery curious appearance. The Japan Cedar (_Cryptomeria japonica_) is\r\nalso here. This tree was brought from China by Mr. Fortune. The Borders\r\nopposite the Sheffield Court are filled with many rare and beautiful\r\nspecimens; but those Borders which are close to the glass façade contain\r\nsome plants of the highest curiosity and beauty. In the centre of the\r\nleft-hand Border will be found the _Socotrine Aloe_, from which is\r\nprocured the medicine which bears its name. On either side of the\r\nentrance to the Court are two magnificent specimens of the Tree Ferns of\r\nTasmania and Australia, whose luxuriant crowns make them objects of the\r\nhighest beauty. These plants are without doubt the finest specimens of\r\nthis luxuriant Fern in this country. At either extremity of the Borders\r\nare most interesting specimens of Bromeliaceous plants, with which,\r\ntill lately, the pine-apple was classed. The Fuchsias here are upwards\r\nof 40 feet high.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the Nave, we find in Border No. 9 _a_, a beautiful\r\nsilver-leaved Acacia, grouped with other plants of the greatest\r\ninterest, amongst which may be pointed out a New Zealand Palm (_Areca\r\nsapida_), and an _Agnostis sinuatis_, recognisable by its peculiar leaf.\r\nAt the end of this Border will also be found the Botany Bay Fig-tree,\r\nand the _Olea Europea_, from which the olive-oil of Commerce is\r\nprocured. The succeeding Borders Nos. 11 and 11 _a_, opposite the\r\nBirmingham Court, contain selections of most valuable and interesting\r\nplants, similar in many respects to those we have described; amongst\r\nthem may be noticed the _Freycinetia Baueriani_ from Norfolk Island.\r\nClose to the entrance of the Birmingham Court, in Border 11 _b_, is the\r\nnew and beautiful _Mitraria Coccinea_ from South America.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at Border No. 13, opposite the Stationery Court, the\r\nlargest and most prominent tree in which is the _Eucalyptus globulosus_,\r\nor Blue Gum-tree of Australia. This plant has already attained the\r\nheight of 80 feet, and is but five years’ growth. In its natural state\r\nthis is a Mammoth tree. Mr. Backhouse, the traveller, has described one\r\nof this kind, which was nearly as high as the great Water Towers at the\r\nCrystal Palace, being 250 feet, with a circumference at the base of 70\r\nfeet. But this was most probably an exceptional specimen. They are most\r\nfrequently not more than half that size. The common Myrtle is the type\r\nof the class to which this tree belongs; but it is the largest of the\r\nmyrtaceous plants. The _Eucalypti_ constitute four-fifths of the forests\r\nof New Holland. Gum is procured from this tree in large quantities.\r\n\r\nRound the column, in the corner of Border No. 13 _a_, is a fine plant of\r\nthe Cape Gooseberry, which bears a beautifully acid fruit, much esteemed\r\nby some. The fruit is curiously inclosed in an inflated capsule.\r\nAlthough called the Cape Gooseberry, this plant is originally from\r\nAustralia. In this Border are various specimens of New Zealand and\r\nAustralian plants. The remaining Border, before we enter the Central\r\nTransept, is filled mostly with a collection of large _Acacia_. Having\r\ncrossed the Central Transept, as we proceed toward Border No. 19, which\r\nis in front of the Egyptian Court, we pass Border No. 17, which is\r\nfilled with _Eucalypti_, as that in a corresponding position on the\r\nother side of the Transept is with _Acaciæ_.\r\n\r\nIn Borders Nos. 19 and 19 _a_, will be found large specimens of the\r\n_Sparmannia Africana_, an old conservatory favourite, indigenous to the\r\nCape. It was named in honour of Dr. Sparman, the Swedish physician and\r\nbotanist, who accompanied Captain Cook in his second voyage round the\r\nworld. These fine trees were presented by Her Majesty the Queen. Close\r\nto the _Sparmannia_ is a large India-Rubber-tree, the sap of which\r\nconstitutes the article now so extensively known and used. It will\r\neasily be recognised by its broad, handsome, and glossy leaves. This\r\ntree belongs to the Fig tribe, all kinds of which bear sap with more or\r\nless the same properties. A plant close to this is the _Loquat_, or\r\nJapan Medlar, which is curious from its peculiarity of shedding its\r\nbark. A little nearer to the Court will be found a most elegant plant of\r\nthe Grass tribe, the Himalayan Bamboo, a small and delicate cane, which\r\nis found high up the Himalayas, and consequently flourishes in a lower\r\ndegree of temperature than the common tropical Bamboo. The remaining\r\nexamples to be noticed in these Borders are amongst the most curious in\r\nthe collection. The first is the _Rhipidodendron plicatile_, so named\r\nfrom the fan-like growth of the leaves. The common lily is the type of\r\nthe order to which this plant belongs. The next are the curious African\r\nplants, like rough blocks of wood, which are called “Elephant’s Foot.”\r\nThese remarkable plants are calculated as being 3000 years old: they\r\nwere imported from the Cape of Good Hope. The _Casuarina stricta_, of\r\nAustralia, is also here, with its curiously jointed foliage. The wood of\r\nthis plant, from its peculiar conformation and colour, has gained for\r\nthe tree the name of Beef-wood. In its native state it attains a great\r\nsize. Several kinds of the temperate Palms, Ferns, and Aloes are also\r\narranged in this position.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable tree in Border No. 21, is a luxuriant specimen of\r\nthe Moreton Bay Pine (_Araucaria Cunninghamii_). In the succeeding\r\nBorder, No. 21 _a_, is another of the _Eucalypti_, the leaves of which,\r\nit is curious to remark, change from round to lance-shaped as the tree\r\nadvances in growth; and in the further corner is the _Geitonoplesium_, a\r\ntrailing plant of the same order as the common Asparagus. In Border No.\r\n23 _a_, just opposite the column, is the Peppermint tree, of Australia\r\n(_Epyclautus piperata_).\r\n\r\nWe now pass through the division into the Tropical end of the building,\r\nwhere necessarily many of the most interesting and beautiful of trees\r\nand plants are congregated. Most of the examples we have hitherto\r\nexamined have borne, more or less, some resemblance, if not in detail\r\nyet in character, to the vegetation which we everywhere see around us in\r\nEngland. But here we notice a new form, reputed to surpass them all, and\r\nat least very rich in those glories which have won its repute,--we mean\r\nthe Palms. This form of vegetation gives more distinctive character to\r\ntropical and eastern scenery, than any other natural feature. The stem\r\noften rising to the altitude of 100 feet, in a stately column, crowned\r\nwith a capital of beautiful leaves, radiating from its summit, or\r\ngracefully drooping; sometimes of a feathery form, sometimes fan-shaped\r\nof broader growth; some of dark, shining verdure, and others of a\r\ndelicate silvery aspect: they constitute one of the most beautiful\r\nfamilies of the vegetable kingdom. The leaves of some kinds are\r\ngigantic; those of the _Manicaria saccifera_, of Brazil, are 20 feet in\r\nlength, and six feet in breadth. Humboldt has described the Wax Palm of\r\nthe Cordilleras growing to the majestic height of 180 feet. Nearly all\r\nvarieties are most prolific in fruit, and with most, scarcely a portion\r\nbut what is applied to some use by the natives of the countries they\r\ninhabit. Their great importance, then, to many of the human family\r\nentitles them to particular study and attention, beyond the brief\r\nmention we can give them here; and the pleasant task will be well\r\nrepaid.\r\n\r\nThe Borders in the Tropical Division are numbered distinctively from the\r\nother part of the building, commencing with Border No. 1, in which is a\r\nplant of the India-Rubber-tree, which is probably the largest of its\r\nkind in the building, and nearer to the corner is a specimen of the Wine\r\nPalm (_Caryota Urens_). On the side opposite the Court will be found the\r\nsilk Cotton-tree of India (_Bombax Ceiba_), and, further round, the\r\nSandbox-tree of India (_Hernandia Sonora_). In Border No. 3, which\r\ncorresponds in position on the other side of the Alhambra Court, is an\r\nEgyptian Date Palm, and also a Wax Palm from South America. In Border\r\nNo. 5 we notice a group of _Musæ_, amongst which beautiful class of\r\nplants are the Banana and Plantain, perhaps the commonest and most\r\nnutritious of tropical fruits. Hemp and flax are obtained from the\r\nfibrous leaves, which are also used for thatching and basket-making. A\r\nsort of wine is made from the juice of the trunk. The fruit is eaten\r\nboth raw and cooked, while the young shoots are consumed as vegetables.\r\nIn the centre of this Border, which runs along parallel with the\r\nAlhambra Court, is one of the species of Sago (_Saguerus sacchifera_);\r\nanother kind (_Cycas revoluta_) is near the column. The Indians as well\r\nas Chinese procure Sago from this tree. The Sago is prepared from the\r\npith of the trunk, selected however at a proper season; it is made into\r\nbread by the natives who prepare it, and from this it has received its\r\nname, which in the language of the Papuas means bread. It is more\r\nprolific in nutritious matter than perhaps any agricultural plant, a\r\nsingle trunk sometimes yielding as much as 600lbs. of Sago. Round these\r\nSago Palms is arranged a collection of various specimens of the Fig\r\ntribe (_Ficus_) from South America. Between the centre columns is a\r\nplant of the _Jatropha Manihot_, whose root is one of the most important\r\narticles of food in the tropics; it is made into bread called Cazavi or\r\nCassava, which is very nutritious; and Tapioca is also obtained from it.\r\nA very poisonous juice has first to be extracted by pressure, or\r\neliminated by heat, before the root can be prepared for food. In the\r\ncorner of the Border we are now inspecting is another tree, from which\r\nalso bread is made; this is the Caffre Bread-tree (_Encephalortus_.) The\r\nnatives remove the bark and make flour from the trunk.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn into the Avenue of Sphinxes, between which is arranged a\r\nrich collection of beautiful Palms--Cocos, Date-Palms, Wine-Palms,\r\nCabbage-Palms, and many other varieties. At the corner as we turn again\r\ninto the Nave stands the _Cocos plumosa_, a peculiarly beautiful\r\nspecimen, which may be remembered as having adorned the Great Exhibition\r\nin 1851.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at Borders No. 7 and 9, opposite the Assyrian Court. In\r\nthis position is arranged a selection of tropical fruit plants, and of\r\nthose bearing articles of food. It will not be necessary to do much more\r\nthan enumerate most of these, as their produce is so well known, and\r\nforms the daily or occasional food of most. At this end of the Border\r\nwill be found the Tamarind-tree, the Pepper-plant, the Sea-side Grape,\r\nfrom the West Indies, the Coffee-tree, the Chili-Capsicum, the fruit of\r\nwhich makes a delicious pickle, the Jujube, the Assam Tea-plant, so\r\nextensively cultivated by the East India Company, the Cow-tree of the\r\nCaraccas, and, advancing up the front of the Border, two kinds of\r\nGinger, the common and a spurious kind, the Rose-apple of the East\r\nIndies, the Avocado Pear, and the Peruvian Custard-apple, at the back of\r\nwhich is the Castor-oil plant, the Jack-tree, and the Malabar Nut. We\r\ncontinue the collection with the Star-apple of the West Indies, the\r\nMadagascar Nutmeg, the Allspice, and the Cassia Bark. We here meet a\r\nfine group of fruiting Bananas, beyond which we shall notice with\r\ninterest the Indian Mimusops, and the plant from which our common Black\r\nPepper is derived (_Piper nigrum_). The _Dimocarpus Longan_, and the\r\nChinese Litchi-Fruit tree, are near, as well as a most interesting plant\r\ncalled the Ordeal-tree, from Madagascar. The fruit is a sort of bean,\r\nand deadly poisonous. When the priests in Madagascar wish to rid\r\nthemselves of a state enemy, or to remove a rich man for the sake of his\r\ngoods, recourse is had to some pretence, and an ordeal is instituted\r\nwhich consists in eating the fruit of this tree, harmless of course to\r\nthe innocent, but to the guilty, poisonous. The crafty priests carry out\r\ntheir views by substituting an innocuous berry similar in appearance,\r\nexcepting where they wish the pretended guilt to manifest itself with\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the corresponding Border, No. 9, is very similar to\r\nthat which we now quit, but we shall find here in addition, the\r\nCinnamon-tree, the Peruvian Bark, the Bohea Tea-tree, the leaves of\r\nwhich we daily consume as plain black tea, another kind of Allspice\r\n(_Myrtus pimenta longifolia_), the Guava of West India, a most delicious\r\nand well-known fruit, the Sapodilla Plum, and the Chinese Paper Plant.\r\nIn the small Border near the aviary, which terminates the series on this\r\nside, is an interesting specimen called the Looking Glass Plant, from\r\nthe silvery appearance of the underside of the leaf. Here also is a\r\nmagnificent example of the Black Bamboo, the canes of which are used for\r\na great variety of useful purposes, and for ornament as well. The rapid\r\ngrowth of this plant is astounding, the shoots of the present specimen\r\nhaving often increased in height at the rate of more than 12 inches\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this, the northern extremity of the Nave, rises one of\r\nthe finest specimens to be met with in this country of the noble _Sabal\r\nPalmetto_. This tree represents the extensive group of Palms, having\r\npalmate or fan-shaped leaves. A curious fibre hangs in graceful ringlets\r\nfrom the foliage. On the right hand of this splendid tree, we commence\r\nour return down the garden side of the Nave with Border No. 10. In the\r\ncorner stands a large group of Bamboos. This species attains a much\r\ngreater size than its cogener on the other side: in its native wilds the\r\nstems often exceed the height of 100 feet, the growth of a single\r\nseason. The stems seldom grow higher after the first year, but become\r\ndensely clothed with delicate leafy branches. This may almost be called\r\nthe domestic Bamboo, as it furnishes material for an almost infinite\r\nvariety of domestic articles. In this Border are two other large\r\nvarieties of Palm. The first _Corypha sylvestris_, from New Holland, is,\r\nlike the _Sabal Palmetto_, a Fan-Palm. The _Coryphæ_ are so called from\r\n_Koryphe_, the summit, as the leaves branch only from the top of the\r\ntrunk, making a very stately and beautiful form. This tree surmounts a\r\ngroup of root-work, upon which are planted rare Orchids, Ferns, and a\r\nvariety of other beautiful exotics. The large Borders on this side of\r\nthe Tropical Department are mostly made in this picturesque manner. If\r\nwe now pass on we find close to the column a large Coffee-tree, from\r\nYemen, which in the autumn bears its interesting berries. Close to this\r\nis a lofty Screw Pine (_Pandanus odoratissimus_) from the East Indies.\r\nThe flowers of this tree are so deliciously fragrant that in Egypt and\r\nArabia it is often cultivated for their sake; the fruit somewhat\r\nresembles the pine-apple, but is not so good. In the South Sea Islands,\r\nwhere this species grows in great plenty, the natives convert its leaves\r\nand products into a variety of uses and ornaments. It has received its\r\nname from the screw-like arrangement of its foliage, and not from the\r\nappearance of the trunk. It will be noticed that the roots are partially\r\nabove ground, and constitute a kind of support which strengthens\r\naccording to the peculiarities of position in which the tree grows. The\r\nroots from some of the _Pandani_ descend thus, like tightly strained\r\ncords, from a height of 12 or 15 feet. The great Palm-tree in the centre\r\nof this bed is upwards of 40 feet high. It is from the Isle of Bourbon\r\n(_Latania Borbonica_), and once formed part of the renowned collection\r\nat Fontainebleau of the Empress Josephine. We are now standing under the\r\nluxuriant branches of the _Ficus Roxburgii_, a curious Fig-tree which\r\nbears its fine fruit on the stem close to the ground. Further back, on\r\nthe left of the great Palm, is a Mahogany-tree from Honduras, and a fine\r\nfruit-bearing specimen, 14 feet high, of the delicious Guava. But it is\r\nimpossible here to particularise the rich contents of these Borders; as\r\nin our progress through the whole collection we are forced almost\r\ncasually to choose from so many objects of interest; but it is hoped\r\nthat the mention only of these may awake an interest which investigation\r\nwill increase.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the Border just mentioned, is arranged a large collection\r\nof exotic plants in pots, amongst which will be found the Gamboge tree,\r\nand the Bread Fruit tree, from the South Sea Islands. Also the\r\nStrychnine plant (_Strychnos Nux vomica_), the nuts of which contain the\r\ndeadly poison of that name.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the succeeding Border, No. 8, next the garden, is one\r\nof the most valuable and rare specimens in the kingdom, of the beautiful\r\n_Araucaria Cookii_ from New Caledonia. The soft and luxuriant foliage of\r\nthis tree, and the surpassing beauty of its form, every branch, with\r\nits rich pendulous load falling most symmetrically in a regular\r\ngradation of graceful positions, constitute it one of the most beautiful\r\nof its kind in the whole vegetable kingdom. Numerous specimens of Palms\r\nand of the beautiful flowering plants and shrubs of the Tropics adorn\r\nthis division. A splendid example of the Gum Dragon tree of Teneriffe\r\n(_Dracæna Draco_), the same kind as the famous tree of Oratova; also a\r\nNew Holland Palm (_Seaforthia robusta_), are found here. Here also is\r\nthe Traveller’s tree from Madagascar, the grateful shade it affords\r\nhaving gained it its name. The Palm bearing the highest position in this\r\nbed is the _Sabal Blackburnianum_, the leaves of which are amongst the\r\nlargest of their kind. Against the column at the south-west corner of\r\nthe bed, in the Nave, hangs the curious Elk’s Horn Fern (_Platycerum\r\ngrande_), from Australia. This parasite abounds on the rocks and the\r\nbark of the large trees in the forests of Moreton Bay.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the Tropical Department we will now continue our\r\ninspection of the Borders on the east side of the Nave. It is\r\nunnecessary to particularise the plants in these Borders, as they have\r\nbeen purposely arranged in as much uniformity as possible with the\r\ncorresponding collection on the other side. Opposite the Byzantine Court\r\nmay however be noticed four funereal Cypresses from the Vale of Tombs,\r\nin North China, and in Border No. 4 a graceful plant of the Fig tribe\r\n(_Ficus Pumila_) from China, and the handsome New Zealand Laurel\r\n(_Carynocarpus lævigatus_). On the northern side of the South Transept,\r\nin Border No. 6, is the Nepaul Berbery (_Berberis Nepaulensis_). This\r\nspecimen is remarkable for its height and beauty of foliage. It is a\r\nnewly introduced species. At the back of this tree will also be found a\r\nfine example of the New Zealand Flax (_Phormium tenax_). In Border No.\r\n6, at the end of the Transept, is the Brazilian Pine (_Araucaria\r\nBraziliensis_). A remarkable specimen of the Australian Fig tree (_Ficus\r\nmacrophylla_), is in Border No. 2.\r\n\r\nIn the Natural History Department the most noticeable plants have been\r\nselected to represent as far as it was possible the flora of the\r\nrespective countries. Thus, in the Australian division the _Araucaria_,\r\n_Tree Ferns_, and _Eucalypti_, or Gum Trees, are most conspicuous. The\r\nother divisions contain many most interesting plants, such as the Tea\r\ntrees, which are all arranged geographically in their respective\r\npositions, and can be readily identified. In the division on the western\r\nside of the Nave, many of the beautiful plants are very well known,\r\nthough indigenous to South, Central, or North America. The Fuchsias,\r\nCacti, Yuccas, Aloes, and some _Araucariæ_, are amongst these.\r\n\r\nIt remains now to speak of the splendid collection of Orange and\r\nPomegranate trees which form the noble vista of the Nave, and are\r\nprincipal features amongst the beauties of the Crystal Palace. Some of\r\nthese are four hundred years old. They once belonged to the Orleans\r\nfamily, and in the latter times of the late dynasty in France were\r\ncollected by Louis Philippe to decorate his favourite château at\r\nNeuilly. Shortly after the accession of the Emperor Napoleon, the\r\nproperty of the Orleans family was sold by public auction, and these\r\nmatchless natural productions were then purchased by Sir Joseph Paxton\r\nfor the Crystal Palace Company; there are 110 of these trees in all.\r\n\r\nThe hanging baskets, which form so delightful an array high up on either\r\nside of the Nave, and around each Transept, cannot fail to attract the\r\nnotice of the visitor. The creeping plants, which cover the columns and\r\ncross-ties on each side of the walks, are of great luxuriance and\r\nbeauty, while at the corner of the South Transept will be noticed a\r\ngigantic specimen of the lovely _Westeria_ which is rapidly covering the\r\nwide span of the Nave at this part. This was one of the first trees of\r\nthe kind which was introduced into this country, and it thrives here\r\nexceedingly well.\r\n\r\nIt must have been apparent to the reader how very cursory has been the\r\nnotice given to the most interesting plants and trees in these pages,\r\nand how few of the many specimens have been referred to. Such was a\r\nnecessity. Yet it is hoped that as the Crystal Palace calls all the aids\r\nof Art to the teachings which it conveys, so Nature (a greater teacher\r\nstill) may side by side yield her lesson too. To the lover of the\r\nbeautiful it needs small prompting to explore her mysteries, and the\r\nrich expression she bears of that he seeks.\r\n\r\nMr. George Eyles is the chief superintendent of the whole Interior\r\nGarden.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GALLERIES.\r\n\r\nTHEIR FINE ART, AND OTHER COLLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe main Galleries around the Central Transept, and to the south with\r\nthe exception of that on the western side toward the road, are devoted\r\nto the exhibition and sale of articles of industry. The Picture Gallery\r\nis in the gallery which runs over the Stationery Court and the series on\r\nthat side. The galleries on the eastern side next the garden, with the\r\nSouth Gallery at the end of the building, are devoted to the exhibition\r\nof those articles which are for sale on the spot. Amongst these will be\r\nfound precious metals and jewellery, miscellaneous ornaments, perfumery,\r\ntoys, and other articles both of use and luxury. The gallery presents a\r\npleasing and animated appearance, the stalls are fitted up on an elegant\r\nand uniform plan, and the traffic at them is very considerable. At the\r\nwestern end of the Great Transept the gallery is allotted for the\r\nexhibition of manufactured articles, which are not for sale on the spot.\r\nThe collection is of a miscellaneous, though most interesting character.\r\nOn the first gallery above this will be found a most interesting\r\ncollection of drawings and models for the fountains in the Crystal\r\nPalace, which have been furnished by Mr. M. D. Wyatt, Mr. Owen Jones\r\n(the figures on whose designs were modelled by Signor Monti), Mr. John\r\nThomas, Mr. John Bell, Baron Marochetti, Baron Launitz, and Mr. Hector\r\nHorreau. The models display much artistic treatment and inventive fancy.\r\n\r\nIf we now descend the spiral staircase to the main gallery, and proceed\r\nthrough the industrial exhibition to the right-hand we shall enter the\r\nmain gallery, on this side, running toward the south end. Here is formed\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PICTURE GALLERY.\r\n\r\nThe first portion which we enter, before reaching that part of the\r\ngallery immediately over the Stationery Court, is appropriated to the\r\nexhibition of photographic pictures both British and foreign, several\r\nimportant water-colour pictures by the most eminent members of the two\r\nSocieties, and a selection of remarkable pastel pictures.\r\n\r\nThe long gallery which stretches from this point to the south end of the\r\nbuilding has been properly fitted for the exhibition of pictures. The\r\nglass wall toward the road has been covered, and a partition wall\r\nerected on the opposite side over the courts, excepting over the passage\r\nways between the courts. The light comes from the roof with duly\r\nmodified intensity, and the effect on the pictures is singularly\r\nbeneficial and clear. Thus a magnificent gallery of pictures is formed,\r\nsweeping in one uninterrupted line, from the centre to the end of the\r\nbuilding, or for a distance of 700 feet. The effect is very grand and at\r\nthe same time beautiful, while the convenience and ample space will be\r\nnoticed as a contrast to many picture galleries. There are upwards of\r\n900 pictures of the British, French, Dutch, Belgian, and German Schools,\r\nbeing all by living artists, and for sale; the titles, prices, and\r\nPainters’ names are affixed to each picture.\r\n\r\nAs we near the south end we shall notice some very fine examples of the\r\nancient masters, several of them being from the galleries of Marshal\r\nSoult, and the Lucca, Orleans and other celebrated collections. The\r\nspecimens of the Gothic art of Flanders and Germany are very remarkable,\r\nand many of the early Italian pictures most worthy of particular notice.\r\nThe early Gothic collection is one of the finest ever seen in England,\r\nand is only surpassed by the Boisserée and Ertborn galleries of Munich\r\nand Antwerp. These curious works keep the full lustre of their original\r\ncolouring, and in this respect form a great distinction to many modern\r\nworks. Mr. C. W. Wass is intrusted with the management of this\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed through the South Gallery and the Industrial Bazaar\r\non the other side to the garden end of the Great Transept, where, in the\r\ngallery above, which we may reach by the spiral staircase, we shall find\r\none of the most interesting departments in the Palace, as it is one of\r\nthe most instructive--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL MUSEUM AND TECHNOLOGICAL COLLECTION.\r\n\r\nThe object of this collection is to convey by means of actual\r\nillustration that instruction in the modes and various stages of\r\nindustrial manufactures, and of the arts, which cannot be so accurately\r\ngained from books or descriptions; as well as, by the same plan, to\r\ntrace the original plants, ores, or annuals, from which the material\r\nmanufactured is derived, and to illustrate by products the several\r\nstages of its manufacture. This plan of arrangement therefore escapes\r\nthe monotony which is usual in ordinary museum collections, and will be\r\nfound equally interesting as instructive. It is not possible in this\r\nbook to particularise by any long description any of the series\r\ncomprised in so extensive a collection; it is not therefore attempted,\r\nbut the leading features and positions of the gallery are indicated to\r\ndirect the investigation of the visitor himself, who will find very\r\naccurate, and in many cases detailed notices appended for his\r\ninstruction, to the objects themselves.\r\n\r\nWe enter the gallery by the spiral staircase in the Central Transept\r\nGallery on the garden side of the building, and shall find that division\r\ndevoted to the minerals, which we will explore first, at the left-hand\r\nextremity of the gallery. The vegetable division is naturally the\r\nlargest, and occupies all the central cases and some portion of the\r\nright hand or northern extremity, where the third and last--the animal\r\ndivision--is situated. A plan detailing plainly this arrangement will be\r\nfound suspended against the first case on the left as we enter. The\r\nfirst cases of the mineral division, which are those in front of the\r\ngallery on the left-hand, are devoted to what are commonly termed the\r\n_non-metallic_ elements and their most important compounds, that is to\r\nsay, those compounds in which the non-metallic element is the one\r\ntechnically important, arranged in the order in which they are generally\r\ntreated in works on Chemistry. It may be necessary here to observe, that\r\nin order to avoid needless repetition in the classification of the\r\nchemical compounds, this plan has been adopted throughout. Thus, for\r\ninstance, Bleaching Powder, which might be arranged under the heads of\r\nboth its constituents, Chlorine and Lime, as it is used only on account\r\nof the Chlorine, is classified under that element. In these cases we\r\nfind varieties of Carbon, Products of the Distillation of Coal, Peat,\r\n&c. (Naphtha, Ammoniacal Salts, Paraffin, Dyes, &c.), and a beautiful\r\nseries illustrating the manufacture of Sulphur. Succeeding these are\r\nshown the varieties of Silica, under which head a rich case of English\r\nAgates from the Sussex coasts must be particularly noticed. The\r\nSilicates embrace the different manufactures of glass, amongst which are\r\nsome beautiful artificial gems. Etching upon glass is also illustrated\r\nhere. We now come to the Alkaline Metals,--Potassium, Sodium, and their\r\nsalts. The next are the minerals of the Alkaline earths, Barium,\r\nStrontium, Calcium (Lime), and Magnesium, and their sundry preparations.\r\nThe cements come under this division. The next cases are devoted to\r\nAluminous products, and in this class will be found complete\r\nillustrations of one of the most important and interesting of British\r\nmanufactures--the Ceramic. The series commences with a collection of the\r\nclays from different formations, and the process by which the Devon,\r\nDorset, and Cornish clays, which are those used in earthenware and\r\nporcelain manufactures, are fashioned, decorated, and finished, is shown\r\ntogether with the materials used for glazes. The preparations of Alum by\r\ndifferent processes, Emery, &c. are also in this division.\r\n\r\nWe now come to one of the most important series in the collection, and\r\none in which the greatness and importance of this country is most\r\nemphatically illustrated. These are the Metals, properly so called. The\r\narrangement adopted with these is first to show the ores from each\r\ndistrict, next the mode of smelting those ores, the metal procured, and\r\ngenerally the manufacture of the metal. The Iron, of course, assumes the\r\nfirst importance. The Pig Iron is the first state in which the metal is\r\nobtained; it is then submitted to the refining and “puddling” processes;\r\nthen rolled into bars, nails, and plates, or drawn into wire; we then\r\nsee it converted into steel, by various processes including Bessemer’s,\r\nand this leads us to the manufactures of Sheffield. The series, of\r\ncourse, includes Copper, Zinc, Tin, Antimony, Gold, Silver, &c.\r\n\r\nThe central stands at this end of the gallery are occupied with a\r\ncollection of the coals and building stones of England and Scotland,\r\nwith a set of maps indicating the geological formation from which each\r\nis obtained.\r\n\r\nThe cases down the centre of the gallery are devoted to the Vegetable\r\nKingdom. These are arranged as follows:--Products used as food, in the\r\narts, and in manufactures, and in medicine. In the first class is a\r\ncollection of British agricultural produce, made by Messrs. Peter Lawson\r\n& Son, of Edinburgh. The Cereals and Grasses will be found arranged in\r\nthe upright cases, facing the garden and on the octagonal tables. In the\r\ncases beneath are the Roots and Fruits modelled in wax. The various\r\ngrowths and manufactures of Tobacco, of Hops, Spices, and aromatic\r\nSeeds, as well as Cocoa, Teas, Coffee, and their substitutes, and the\r\narticles used as food, should be specially noticed, being most\r\ncompletely illustrated. It will be noticed here, and also with most of\r\nthe vegetable specimens in this collection, that reference is made upon\r\nthe explanatory cards, which are in all cases affixed to specimens, to\r\nthe fact that growing trees and plants of the various kinds may be found\r\nin the beds downstairs; and this will be found specially alluded to\r\nwhere the Botanical collection is described; it should be carefully\r\nborne in mind, and will, on being followed by inspection, yield an ample\r\nrepayment of interest. We should now return down the side of the cases\r\nand commence our inspection of the other side, proceeding from the south\r\nend. We shall find the first set of cases illustrating the materia\r\nmedica. The upper parts contain the plants, while in the lower divisions\r\nthe drugs, seeds, and applied parts are shown. Next come the cork and\r\nother manufactures, including paper and paper-staining, those of Fats\r\nand Oils, India Rubber and Gutta Percha, with their various\r\napplications, Resins, Dyes and Dye-woods, these being further\r\nillustrated as with the materia medica by the plants from which they are\r\nprocured. The illustrations of the Cotton, Flax, Hemp, the Pine Apple,\r\nChina Grass and other fibres which are manufactured, will, with some\r\nother interesting articles in the cases opposite, conclude our rapid\r\nsurvey of the vegetable division, although we must not omit to notice a\r\nrich collection of the various woods, British, foreign, and Colonial,\r\nespecially the large polished sections from Tasmania, collected and\r\npresented by the Royal Society of the Colony, arranged on stands at the\r\nNorth End.\r\n\r\nThe northern extremity of the gallery is occupied with the last division\r\nof the Museum--the Animal. Here will be found Furs of all kinds. Wools\r\nof British and imported varieties, Woollen and Worsted manufactures,\r\nSilk, illustrations of the preparation of different kinds of Leather,\r\nFeathers, Horn, Bone, and Tortoiseshell manufactures, &c., &c. Specimens\r\nof most of the animals from which these articles are derived are\r\narranged in the middle of the division.\r\n\r\nThe whole Museum has been arranged by Dr. David S. Price, who has care\r\nof this department. The collection is constantly increasing, and may be\r\nexpected before long to assume one of the most important positions\r\namongst the settled features of the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nIn the Main Gallery on the North Eastern side of the Mediæval Court are\r\nplaced four hundred French and Italian photographs, illustrative of the\r\narchitectural and sculptural arts of the periods represented by the\r\nseveral Fine Art Courts on this side of the Nave; the photographs being\r\narranged in the order of the courts beneath, and as nearly as possible\r\nover those which they serve to illustrate. Here also will be found the\r\nmain portion of the busts constituting the\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT GALLERY,\r\n\r\nOne of the most ennobling and instructive as well as interesting of the\r\ncollections in the Crystal Palace. These busts give us the speechless,\r\nyet how eloquent, countenances of the great ones who have moved the\r\ncurrent of the world’s life, from early times till the present moment.\r\nEach one of these busts is inscribed with the name and dates of whomever\r\nit represents; but for a notice of the lives and general information as\r\nto the claims to renown of the several notabilities, we refer the\r\nvisitor to the Handbook of the Portrait Gallery. A fine collection of\r\nsmall works of art, consisting of statuettes, mediæval pottery and\r\nwood-work, church vessels, old English seals, medals, and architectural\r\nornaments, exemplifying the various styles from the Byzantine down to\r\nthe Italian, is also arranged here.\r\n\r\nIn the North-east Galleries, on the garden side of the North Transept,\r\nis a Naval Museum, which is intended to illustrate the naval\r\narchitecture of all countries. Here will be seen models of boats and\r\nships, from the first rude canoe to the patent collapsing boats; and\r\nfrom the huge high-pooped ship of war of the time of Henry the Eighth,\r\nand Philip of Spain, to the long screw steamer of the present day; or\r\nthe gigantic paddle and screw “Leviathan,” lately launched at Millwall,\r\ntogether with various inventions for marine purposes. In the first\r\ngallery, at the extreme north end of the Nave, a collection is exhibited\r\nof engineering and architectural models, including those of bridges,\r\ndocks, viaducts, churches, and other structures.\r\n\r\nEntering the gallery by the stairs from the garden end of the North\r\nTransept, one of the first models we meet is in illustration of Mr.\r\nFergusson’s System of Fortification. The great principle of this system\r\nis the power of placing in position on a fortified place a greater\r\nnumber of guns than the enemy can bring to bear upon any point of it.\r\nFor this purpose, Mr. Fergusson proposes to erect simple mounds of\r\nearth, bearing two or three tiers of guns, where the place is large and\r\nthe curve flat, and four or even five tiers, where the space is\r\nconfined. The model represents a small confined space surrounded by five\r\ntiers; ensuring in his opinion, a superiority of fire over anything that\r\ncan be brought against it. Mr. Fergusson proposes to employ wet ditches\r\nwherever water is available; but on dry or uneven ground, a ditch of\r\nfifty or sixty feet, with a loop-holed wall at the bottom, not less than\r\nthirty feet high, thoroughly flanked in every part by musketry and\r\nartillery from the small bastions placed at intervals along its fronts.\r\nThe model represents upon its different faces, suggestions for various\r\nmethods of arming the ramparts and of flanking defences.\r\n\r\nAmongst the various ingenious and beautiful objects in this part of the\r\ngallery will be remarked models of the Kieff Suspension Bridge, the\r\noriginal of which is nearly half-a-mile long, over the river Dneiper;\r\nthe Britannia Tubular Bridge; the Wrought Iron Bridge over the Wye, at\r\nChepstow; and one of a similar construction over the river Tamar, at\r\nSaltash. Most of these, as also the fine Viaducts, of which many are\r\nrepresented, are due to the giant enterprise which steam traffic raised\r\nin our country. There are two crystal models here of the Great\r\nExhibition Palace in Hyde Park; one, the largest, by Mr. Dighton, of\r\nLondon, on the scale of half an inch to the foot, is especially\r\nbeautiful and complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN COURT.\r\n\r\nPassing on in this gallery, at the back of the Assyrian Court, we enter\r\na department appropriated as an Indian Court. The first object which we\r\nnotice is a stand covered on both sides with a fine collection of Indian\r\narms and armour arranged with other objects of interest. On the wall\r\nnear is ranged a collection of most interesting paintings, lent to the\r\nCrystal Palace by the Hon. East India Company. They are copies of some\r\nfrescoes found on the walls of a series of caverns at Adjunta, in\r\nWestern India, and were made at the instance of the Indian Government by\r\nCaptain Gill, of the Madras army. The subjects are scenes in the life of\r\nBuddha and of Buddhist saints, and various historical events connected\r\nwith the rise and progress of the Buddhist religion in India. The date\r\nof their execution extends from about the Christian era to the tenth or\r\ntwelfth century; and in style they closely resemble the contemporary\r\nworks of painters in Europe, possessing nearly the same amount of\r\nartistic merit, and displaying the like absence of _chiar’-oscuro_, and\r\nthe same attempt to copy with literal exactness the object represented,\r\nexcepting where certain conventionalities are apparent. The collection\r\nis valuable as affording the means of comparing the state of art in the\r\nEast with that in the West during the same period.\r\n\r\nOn the next stand are several Burmese idols and other curious objects,\r\nmostly belonging to the religious ceremonial of this people; among these\r\nwill be noticed some very curious wood-carving; and we must not omit to\r\nnotice in connection with these things, a very peculiar pagoda, or idol\r\nshrine, which stands close by. Placed along the floor are some very\r\ncurious musical instruments, drums or tom-toms of various sizes, some\r\ninstruments formed of pieces of hard wood, which on being struck sound\r\nthe notes, and some having metal vessels, which produce a peculiar tone.\r\nFurther on is a case filled with magnificently embroidered garments,\r\nsaddle-cloths, &c., which display that craving after splendour which\r\nappears to be part of Oriental nature. In this case are also some other\r\nchoice articles of very great beauty and value, amongst which may be\r\npointed out a small Japanese cabinet; a hookah, a dagger and sheath\r\nwrought with silver, a pair of slippers embroidered with pearls, and\r\nother rare objects from Persia. Here also are some specimens of Chinese\r\nwork. On the right of this case is a chamber devoted to Chinese\r\ncuriosities. The walls are hung with paintings, representing the\r\nmanufacturing and other industrial occupations of this truly curious\r\npeople. In the centre is the figure of a Mandarin in his richly\r\nembroidered dress. Quitting this chamber the visitor will remark on\r\neither side of him some fine models of Indian Mosques, carved in wood,\r\nwhich will amply repay a careful inspection. They belong to the close of\r\nthe 15th century. After examining the curious model of the encampment of\r\nan Indian prince, which now faces him, the visitor will notice a case\r\ncontaining a splendid collection of Javanese arms, some highly wrought\r\nwith great beauty in gold and silver. This case also contains some\r\nwonderful carvings in ivory and pith, as well as other objects of great\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nImmediately beyond the case which we have just examined will be found a\r\nmodel of the celebrated so-called gates of Somnauth. History and\r\ntradition have invested these gates with much interest. Nine centuries\r\nsince, the temple of Somnauth was perhaps the richest shrine of rich\r\nIndia, and the splendid stronghold of its idolatry. There are many\r\nrecords of its unequalled riches--the revenues of 2000 villages are said\r\nto have been allotted for the maintenance of its establishment. In 1025,\r\nthe sultan Mahmoud crossed the Indus from Ghuznee, and after many\r\nbattles advanced to the temple and sacked it. In the adulations of the\r\nconqueror Hindoo paganism was said to have then irrecoverably bowed\r\nbefore the sword and faith of Mahomet. The avarice, however, of Mahmoud\r\nprobably received greater gratification than his religious fervour. He\r\nis traditionally said to have carried the carved sandal-wood gates of\r\nthe temple with him to Ghuznee, and to have made them the doors of the\r\nsplendid mausoleum which he built for himself. When Ghuznee was taken by\r\nthe British under the presidency of Lord Ellenborough, the doors (of\r\nwhich the present models are copies) were taken from the tomb, and\r\ninvested with high interest on account of their traditional origin, but\r\nthe style of art and inscriptions upon the gates themselves prove that\r\nin all probability they formed part of the tomb from which they were\r\ntaken and were built with it. Near to this model will also be found some\r\nvery finely carved furniture, and a case filled with a magnificent\r\ncollection of Indian works, amongst which may be specially pointed out\r\nthe beautiful and rich specimens of jewellery from Delhi and other\r\nprovinces, some elaborate carvings in pearl, ivory, and tortoiseshell,\r\nand the gold-worked muslins for which, through many ages, India has been\r\nrenowned.\r\n\r\nThe gallery over the Egyptian, Greek, and Roman Courts contains an\r\ninteresting collection of Photographs, &c., illustrative of Oriental\r\nArchitecture, and the various styles exemplified below, amongst which\r\nthe Egyptian remains are particularly to be remarked. The full-sized\r\ncasts from the original wall sculptures, which, are copied in the\r\nEgyptian Court below, will be found along this Gallery, as also various\r\narchitectural and sculptural remains of classic times.\r\n\r\nWe should now descend the staircase to the left, and, crossing over to\r\nthe eastern end of the Great Transept, we can reach the basement story\r\nof the building, which is on a level with the first Terrace. The\r\nBasement has been divided into two departments: that to the north is\r\nallotted to the exhibition of Agricultural Implements, &c.; in that to\r\nthe south is arranged the important exhibition of Machinery in Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe application of science to farming, and the great necessity that\r\nthere is at the present day of availing ourselves of every mechanical\r\nimprovement for the sake of economy, and for the better carrying out of\r\nthe various agricultural operations, render the use of improved\r\nmachinery an absolute necessity. And when we compare the flail of a few\r\nyears ago with our present threshing-machines, and note how mechanical\r\npower has, in a very few years, almost entirely taken the place of\r\nhand-labour in this, as in every other art, we shall see that the\r\nimprovement in agricultural machinery has been making most rapid\r\nstrides, and that the manufacture of agricultural implements has grown\r\nto a most important industry.\r\n\r\nThe collection of these implements at the Crystal Palace supplies a\r\ndesideratum that has been felt and acknowledged both by the public and\r\nby the manufacturers themselves--an emporium where the various machines\r\nof every maker may be brought together, so as to be seen at one glance\r\nand their respective merits examined; thus facilitating the selection\r\nby purchasers, and in some measure preventing the possibility of\r\ninferior implements being sent out. This has been partially effected by\r\nthe exhibitions of the Smithfield Club, and by the periodical gathering\r\nof the Royal Agricultural Society; but it is only with the present\r\nattempt that the same thing on a permanent footing has been offered to\r\nthe public. In the Crystal Palace are now exhibited and _sold_ the\r\nprincipal machines made by nearly all the first manufacturers; indeed,\r\neach firm has sent those machines for which it is chiefly noted, so that\r\neverything exhibited in this department must be of the very best; such,\r\nin short, as the manufacturers are most proud of. All the machines, &c.,\r\nare sold by the Superintendent on the spot, at the same prices as at the\r\nmakers.\r\n\r\nThese machines comprise a large collection of prize, portable, and fixed\r\nsteam-engines; a large assortment of drill machines, both for drilling\r\nseed and manure; several reaping machines are also exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe threshing-machines are numerous, and are of very excellent\r\nconstruction. The improvements that have been made in them are very\r\nstriking. It is really a curious sight to see the sheaves of wheat\r\nplaced in at one end, and the winnowed grain passing out ready sorted\r\ninto bags at the other; while the straw is carried by a mechanical\r\ncontrivance to carts to be taken away. Here also we see digging\r\nmachines, to perform wholesale the ancient duty of the plough, which was\r\nat all times an imperfect implement. The ploughs, however, that are\r\nshown are of the very best description, with many useful improvements.\r\nPortable houses for emigrants and others, and an immense assortment of\r\nentrance gates, and of poultry, sheep, and cattle fencing are also here\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nHaymaking machines for scattering the hay, and horse-rakes, are\r\nimportant substitutions for hand-labour. Draining-ploughs, for preparing\r\na pathway for the pipes, and for laying the tiles, and draining levels\r\nare also exhibited. A large collection of chaff-cutters, bruising and\r\ngrinding mills, oilcake breakers, steaming apparatus and pulping\r\nmachines (the pulping machines are for preparing food, such as turnips\r\nor carrots, for cattle), grass-mowing machines, both for hand and\r\nhorse-power, carts of every description, liquid manure carts, field\r\nrollers, and several descriptions of clodcrushers, brick and the\r\nmachines, mortising and boring machines very well suited for making\r\ngates and hurdles, makes up the sum of this interesting exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MACHINERY IN MOTION.\r\n\r\nMachinery is the most important feature in the modern history of our\r\ncountry. How it has enriched and extended our commerce, and built up the\r\ngreatness of the nation, is an interesting and instructive reflection.\r\nIt thus justly claims the important position which it here occupies. The\r\nlong array of busy engines, which stretches almost as far as the eye can\r\nreach, forcibly reminds the visitor of this department in the old\r\nCrystal Palace of Hyde Park. Indeed, the most interesting set of\r\nmachinery, that employed in cotton spinning, which instructed so many\r\nthousands in Hyde Park as to the manner in which the huge bale of cotton\r\nwas transformed into the perfect woven fabric, is now to be seen here in\r\nfull work. The set includes Beating Frames, Carding Engines, Drawing,\r\nSlubbing, and Roving Frames, Throstle Spinning Frames and self-acting\r\nMules. Near at hand to this most perfect and beautiful collection of\r\nmachinery, which was manufactured by Walker and Hacking, and Harrison &\r\nCo., are placed the rude wooden engines invented and used by Arkwright\r\nfor the same purpose; thus we are enabled to measure at a glance the\r\nimmense progress we have made in the course of less than a century.\r\nProceeding lower down the gallery, the visitor is struck with\r\nastonishment at the massive machinery by which iron is hammered,\r\ndrilled, punched, and planed as easily as so much deal. Messrs.\r\nWhitworth, Muir, and Harrison & Co., are the principal exhibitors of\r\nthese ponderous engines. Advancing still further, the visitor witnesses\r\na sugar-cane crusher in motion. Centrifugal pumps, Drying Machines,\r\ntogether with Steam Engines of all descriptions in full work form the\r\nnext most important features, whilst innumerable other inventions and\r\nmachines of a smaller character make this part of the palace one of the\r\nmost interesting. The visitor can, if he choose, reach the South Wing\r\nthrough this department, and pass from thence down the Colonnade to the\r\nRailway Station; but he will most probably pass from the door under the\r\nCentral Transept on to the first Terrace, and proceed to the inspection\r\nof the Gardens and Park, of which we treat in the next division.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE EXTERIOR.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.--The arrangement of the following Division assumes the visitor\r\n  to enter the Garden from the Central Transept, whence he proceeds to\r\n  inspect the _Terraces_ and the _Italian Garden_. Passing down the\r\n  central steps from the second Terrace, and round the _Great Circular\r\n  Fountain_, he proceeds to the left, and continuing the path, explores\r\n  the _English Landscape Garden_, and the _Archery Ground_, beyond which\r\n  is the _Park_, the _Cricketing Ground_, from which, proceeding half\r\n  round the basin of one of the _Great Fountains_, he reaches the _Grand\r\n  Plateau_, and examines the _Geological Restorations and the Extinct\r\n  Animals on the Islands in the Lake_. Leaving the _Plateau_, he skirts\r\n  the basin of the second _Great Fountain_, and proceeding by the\r\n  _Rosary_, completes the circuit of the grounds. An account of the\r\n  _Great Water Towers_, in connection with the system of _Fountains_,\r\n  and of the _Artesian Well_ and the _Water Supply_ is then added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE GARDENS AND PARK\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY R.K. BURT, HOLBORN HILL, CITY.\r\n\r\nA. GREAT CIRCULAR FOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nB. B. WATER TEMPLES AND CASCADES\r\n\r\nC. THE ENGLISH LANDSCAPE GARDEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Park and Gardens.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SITE.\r\n\r\nThe Crystal Palace stands in the county of Surrey, immediately on the\r\nconfines of Kent, bordered on one side by Sydenham, and on the other by\r\nNorwood and Anerley, whilst Penge lies at the foot of the hill, and\r\nDulwich Wood at the top. No particular topographical or historical facts\r\nare associated with these places. Sydenham, however, is invested with\r\nsome literary interest as having been the residence of the poet\r\nCampbell, the author of the “Pleasures of Hope,” who passed, as he says\r\nin one of his letters, the happiest years of his life in this suburban\r\nvillage, and who wrote here the whole of “Gertrude of Wyoming.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARK AND GARDENS.\r\n\r\nThe Crystal Palace and its grounds occupy two hundred acres, and it is\r\nof importance to note that, in the formation of the gardens, the same\r\nuniformity of parts is adhered to as in the building itself; that is to\r\nsay, the width of the walks, the width and length of the basins of the\r\nfountains, the length of the terraces, the breadth of the steps, are all\r\nmultiples and sub-multiples of the one primary number of eight. By this\r\nsymmetrical arrangement perfect harmony prevails, unconsciously to the\r\nlooker-on, in the structure and in the grounds.\r\n\r\nAs the visitor quits the building from the Central Transept, let him\r\npause at the top of the broad flight of steps leading to the first\r\nterrace, and notice the prospect before him. At his feet are the upper\r\nand lower terraces, bordered by stone balustrades, the long lines of\r\nwhich are broken by steps and projecting bastions. Along these\r\nbalustrades, at intervals, the eye is attracted by the statues that\r\nsurmount them. Straight before him runs the broad central walk, and, on\r\neither side of it, on the second terrace, the ground is covered with\r\ngreen turf, now relieved by beds filled with gay-coloured flowers, and\r\nfurther heightened in effect by fountains which throw water high up into\r\nthe air. As a side boundary to the foreground of this picture, the wings\r\nof the building stretch out in their blue colouring, their cheerful,\r\nlight aspect, harmonising with the rest of the scene. Looking straight\r\nforward, below the level of the second terrace, we see the large\r\ncircular fountain, surrounded by white marble statues, which stand out\r\nsharp and clear against the dark landscape beyond. On either side, on a\r\nyet lower level, a glimpse is caught of the glistening waters in the two\r\nlargest fountains, backed by embankments of turf; and beyond these\r\nagain, if we could only lift our vision over the plateau, we should see\r\nthe waters of the large lake, whose islands are peopled by monsters that\r\ninhabited the earth when the world was young. To the right, and to the\r\nleft, in the grounds, are pleasant sloping lawns, dotted here and there\r\nwith trees, and thickly planted shrubs; and then, beyond the Palace\r\nprecincts, stretching away into the far distance, is visible the great\r\ngarden of Nature herself, a picture of rural loveliness, almost\r\nunmatched by any scene so close as this to the great London city.\r\nUndulating scenery prevails: here it is rich with bright verdure, there\r\ndark with thick wood: here, the grass field; there, the grey soil,\r\nwhich, in the spring time, is covered with the delicate green of young\r\nwheat; and, in the autumn, waves thick with golden corn. Across the\r\nfields run long lines of hedgerows, telling plainly of the country in\r\nwhich they are found; and in the very heart of all, the village church\r\nspire shoots through the trees, surrounded by clusters of cottages,\r\nwhose modest forms are almost hidden by the dark foliage in which they\r\nare nestled. The exquisite scene is completed by a long line of blue\r\nhills that ranges at the back of all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF GREAT TRANSEPT.]\r\n\r\nGardening, as an art, has flourished in all countries; and has possessed\r\nin each such distinctive features as the climate, the nature of the\r\nsoil, and its physical formation, as well as the character of the\r\npeople, have created. In the Gardens before us two styles are seen, THE\r\nITALIAN and THE ENGLISH LANDSCAPE. A few words may be sufficient to\r\ndescribe the leading characteristics of both.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, during the middle ages, internal warfare confined men to their\r\nfortresses, and no gardens existed save those “pleasaunces” cultivated\r\nwithin the castle’s quadrangle. When times grew more peaceful, men\r\nbecame more trustful, ventured forth, enjoyed the pleasures of a country\r\nlife, and gardening prospered. In monasteries especially, the art\r\nreceived attention; but it was not until the beginning of the 16th\r\ncentury that a decided advance was manifest, and then we have to note a\r\nreturn to the style of gardening that flourished in ancient Rome itself.\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici possessed a garden laid out in the revived classical\r\nmanner, and this style, which is recognised as the Italian, has existed\r\nin Italy with certain modifications ever since. Its chief features are\r\nthe profuse use of architectural ornaments--the grounds being subdivided\r\ninto terraces, and adorned with temples, statuary, urns, and vases, beds\r\ncut with mathematical precision, formal alleys of trees, straight walks,\r\nhedges cut into fantastic devices, jets of water, elaborate rock-work,\r\nand fish-ponds dug into squares or other geometrical forms. Everything\r\nin these gardens is artificial in the extreme, and in set opposition to\r\nthe wild luxuriance of nature; and although the trees and shrubs are\r\nplanted with a great regard to precision, they are too frequently devoid\r\nof all artistic effect. During the last century, the Italian style\r\nbecame blended with English landscape-gardening, but without much\r\nsuccess; for the formality of the original style clings to all Italian\r\ngardening at the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from the Terrace.]\r\n\r\nEnglish gardening does not seem to have been regularly cultivated until\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII.; although previously to his time, parks and\r\ngardens had been laid out. Bluff King Hal formed the gardens of Nonsuch\r\nPalace in Surrey on a most magnificent scale, decking them out with many\r\nwonderful and curious contrivances, including a pyramid of marble with\r\nconcealed holes, which spirted water upon all who came within reach,--a\r\npractical joke which our forefathers seem to have relished highly, for\r\nthe ingenious engine was imitated in other gardens after that period. In\r\nthis reign also were first laid out by Cardinal Wolsey the Hampton Court\r\nGardens, containing the labyrinth, at that period an indispensable\r\ndevice of a large garden. The artificial style in James I.’s time called\r\nforth the indignation of the great Lord Bacon, who, although content to\r\nretain well-trimmed hedges and trees, pleaded strongly in the interest\r\nof nature. He insisted that beyond the highly dressed and embellished\r\nparts of the garden, should ever lie a portion sacred from the hand of\r\nman--a fragment of wild nature! He calls it “the heath, or desert.”\r\nDuring Charles II.’s reign, landscape-gardening received an impulse. It\r\nwas in his time that Chatsworth was laid out, and that buildings were\r\nintroduced into gardens. During his reign, too, lived Evelyn--a spirit\r\ndevoted to the service of the rural genius. In his Diary, Evelyn makes\r\nmention of several noblemen’s and gentlemen’s gardens which he visited,\r\nand some of which indeed he himself devised. His remarks convey an idea\r\nof the state of gardening during the reign of the merry monarch.\r\n“Hampton Park, Middlesex,” he says, “was formerly a flat, naked piece of\r\nground, now planted with sweet rows of lime trees, and the canal for\r\nwater now near perfected; also the hare park. In the garden is a rich\r\nand noble fountain, with syrens, statues, &c., cast in copper by\r\nFanelli, but no plenty of water. There is a parterre which they call\r\nParadise, in which is a pretty banqueting-house set over a cave or\r\ncellar.” It was under Charles too that St. James’s Park was formed, a\r\nlabour upon which the king employed Le Nôtre, the celebrated gardener of\r\nVersailles,--an artist of singular good taste, and with an admirable eye\r\nfor the picturesque.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of William and Mary, Hampton Court was considerably\r\nimproved. Some Dutch features were introduced into gardening, and\r\nvegetable sculpture, and parterres in lace, came into vogue.\r\n\r\nTo the Dutch must be conceded the earliest manifestation of a love for\r\ngardening, in Northern Europe--a feeling possessed by them even before\r\nthe thirteenth century. The taste owed its origin, no doubt, partly to\r\nthe general monotony of their country, partly to the wealth of their\r\nmerchants, and partly to an extended commerce, which enabled the Dutch\r\nto import from the East those bulbous roots which have long been\r\ncultivated in Holland, and were once valued at fabulous prices. Dutch\r\ngardening soon acquired a peculiar character of its own. The gardens of\r\nLoo, laid out in the time of William III., were excellent examples of\r\nthe symmetrical Dutch style; a canal divided the upper from the lower\r\ngarden; the beds were cut in squares, and filled at various seasons of\r\nthe year with tulips, hyacinths, poppies, sun-flowers, &c.; straight\r\nwalks intersected the grounds, which were adorned with numerous statues,\r\ngrotto-work, and fountains, some exceedingly whimsical and curious; the\r\ntrees and shrubs were cut into devices, principally in pyramidal forms,\r\nwhilst hedges separated the different parts of the garden, and were not\r\nallowed to grow above a certain height. Straight rows and double rows of\r\ntrees constitute another characteristic of the Dutch style, and\r\nelaborate lace-like patterns for parterres were much in vogue during the\r\nlatter part of the seventeenth century. The influence of this style upon\r\nEnglish gardens may still be perceived in the clipped hedgerows and\r\ntrees, green terraces, and now only prim, now magnificent avenues, so\r\nfrequent in our country.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that from William down to George II., gardening in\r\nEngland suffered sad deterioration as an art. Formality prevailed to\r\nthe most deadening and oppressive extent. The shapes of men and animals\r\nwere cut in trees, and the land was threatened with a vast and hideous\r\ncollection of verdant sculpture. Pope and Addison came to the rescue of\r\nnature, and ridiculed the monstrous fashion. Pope, in one of his papers\r\nin “The Guardian,” details an imaginary set of plants for sale,\r\nincluding a “St. George, in box, his arm scarce long enough, but will be\r\nin condition to stick the dragon next April;” and a “quickset hog shot\r\nup into a porcupine by being forgot a week in rainy weather.” Addison,\r\nin “The Spectator,” says, “Our British gardeners, instead of humouring\r\nnature, love to deviate from it as much as possible. Our trees rise in\r\ncones, globes, and pyramids. We see the marks of the scissors upon every\r\nplant and bush.” Pope himself laid out his grounds in his villa at\r\nTwickenham; and his gardens there, which still bear the impress of his\r\ntaste, attest to his practical skill as a gardener.\r\n\r\nThe satire of these great writers contributed not a little to a\r\nrevolution in English gardening. Bridgeman seems to have been the first\r\nto commence the wholesome work of destruction, and to introduce\r\nlandscape gardening; and it is said that he was instigated to his labour\r\nby the very paper of Pope’s, in “The Guardian,” to which we have\r\nalluded. But Kent, at a later period, banished the old grotesque and\r\nridiculous style, and established the new picturesque treatment. He laid\r\nout Kensington Gardens, and probably Claremont. Wright and Brown were\r\nalso early artists in the new style, and deserve honourable mention for\r\ntheir exertions in the right direction. The former displayed his skill\r\nat Fonthill Abbey, the seat of Mr. Beckford; Brown was consulted at\r\nBlenheim, where he constructed the earliest artificial lake in the\r\nkingdom,--the work of a week. Nor must Shenstone, the poet, be\r\nforgotten. His attempt, towards 1750, to establish the rights of nature\r\nin his own ornamental farm at the Leasowes, places him fairly in the\r\nfront rank of our rural reformers. Mathematical precision and the yoke\r\nof excessive art were thus cast off, and nature was allowed a larger\r\nextent of liberty and life. She was no longer tasked to imitate forms\r\nthat detracted from her own beauty without giving grace to the\r\nimitation; but she was questioned as to the garb which it chiefly\r\ndelighted her to wear, and answer being given, active steps were taken\r\nto comply with her will. Then came Knight and Price to carry out the\r\ngoodly work of recovery and restoration. To them followed Mr. Humphrey\r\nRepton, the accomplished scholar under whose eye the gardens of Cobham\r\nHall were planned, and under whose influence all the celebrated\r\nlandscape-gardens of his time were fashioned. And as the result of the\r\nunited labours of one and all, we have the irregularly-bounded pieces of\r\nwater which delight the English eye, the shrubberies, the noble groups\r\nof trees, the winding walks, the gentle undulations, and pleasant\r\nslopes,--all which combined give a peculiar charm to our island\r\nlandscapes, that is looked for in vain in fairer climates and on a more\r\nextended soil.\r\n\r\nIn the Crystal Palace Gardens, the Italian style has not been servilely\r\ncopied, but rather adapted and appropriated. It has been taken, in fact,\r\nas the basis of a portion of our garden, and modified so as to suit\r\nEnglish climate and English taste. Thus, we have the terraces and the\r\narchitectural display, the long walks, the carefully cut beds, and the\r\nornamental fountains: but the undulations of greensward, that bespeak\r\nthe English soil, give a character to the borrowed elements which they\r\ndo not find elsewhere. The violent juxtaposition of the two styles of\r\ngardening--the Italian and the English--it may readily be conceived,\r\nwould produce a harsh and disagreeable effect. To avoid the collision,\r\nSir Joseph Paxton has introduced, in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nterraces and the broad central walk, a mixed or transitional style,\r\ncombining the formality of the one school with the freedom and natural\r\ngrace of the other; and the former character is gradually diminished\r\nuntil, at the north side of the ground, it entirely disappears, and\r\nEnglish landscape-gardening is looked upon in all its beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERRACES.\r\n\r\nDescending the steps we reach the first terrace, on the parapet of which\r\nare placed twenty-six allegorical statues of the most important\r\ncommercial and manufacturing countries in the world, and of the chief\r\nindustrial cities of England and France. The length of the upper terrace\r\nis 1576 feet, and its width 48 feet; the terrace wall is of Bath-stone.\r\nThe granite pedestals on each side of the steps, leading from the Great\r\nTransept, are 16 feet by 24 feet. The width of the central flight of\r\nsteps is 96 feet; and this is also the width of the grand central walk.\r\nThe lower terrace, along which are ranged the first six fountains of the\r\nupper series, is 1664 feet long between the wings of the building, or\r\nnearly one-third of a mile, and 512 feet wide, the basins for the\r\nfountains on this terrace being, in their measurements, as before\r\nstated, all multiples of eight. The total length of the garden front of\r\nthe wall of this terrace, which is formed into alcoves, is 1896 feet.\r\nThe length of the broad central gravel walk from the building to the end\r\nof the garden in a direct line is 2660 feet. Such are a few of the\r\nprincipal measurements connected with the Palace Gardens, as these are\r\nseen on the surface. But although the work that is above ground may be\r\nrecognised and calculated with little trouble by the visitor, there is\r\nbeneath the surface an amount of labour and capital expended, of which\r\nhe can with difficulty form an accurate idea. Drain pipes spread under\r\nhis feet like a net-work, and amount in length to several miles; he\r\ntreads on thousands of bundles of faggots which have formed his path; he\r\nwalks over ten miles of iron piping which supply the fountains for his\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the great central staircase are statues representing\r\nMulhouse, Glasgow, and Liverpool (to the right as we face the gardens),\r\nthe two first by Calder Marshall, the third by Spence. On the left side\r\nare personifications of Paris, Lyons, and an allegorical statue of\r\nFrench art, the first by Etex.\r\n\r\nThe next bastion, on the Sydenham side, is surmounted by statues of\r\nSpain and Italy, admirably executed by Monti; the succeeding bastion\r\nforms a pedestal for the very characteristic figures of California and\r\nAustralia, by Bell. The staircase at this end of the terrace is\r\nornamented at the first angle with representations of South America, by\r\nMonti, and of Turkey and Greece by Baron Marochetti; the second group\r\nconsists of India and Egypt, also by Marochetti, and of China, by Monti.\r\n\r\nThe first bastion, on the Norwood side of the central staircase,\r\nsupports allegorical statues of Manchester, by Theed, and Belfast, by\r\nLegrew. On the succeeding one are placed those of Sheffield and\r\nBirmingham, by Bell.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the staircase, at this point, are very excellent\r\nrepresentations of the Zollverein and Holland, by Monti, and of Belgium,\r\nby Geefs.\r\n\r\nThe last group consists of a fine allegorical statue of the United\r\nStates, by Powers, and of Canada and Russia, by Launitz.\r\n\r\nAll these figurative subjects are more or less composed in the style of\r\nthe modern Romantic school of sculpture, and afford excellent\r\nillustrations of the character, nature, and chief occupations of the\r\ncountries and cities they represent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Arcade and Rosary.]\r\n\r\nProceeding in a northerly direction, we pass on until we reach a flight\r\nof steps, by which we gain the lower terrace, or Italian flower-garden.\r\nAt the bottom of these steps are stone recesses, built under the terrace\r\nabove, in which streams of water fall from dolphins’ mouths into bronze\r\nbasins. Crossing the terrace by the path facing the steps, the visitor\r\nturns to the right, examining the flowers and the fountains, until he\r\narrives at the central steps leading to the circular basin, from which\r\npoint a most admirable view of the whole crystal structure is obtained.\r\nThe deep recesses in the transepts, the open galleries, the circular\r\nroof to the nave, the height of the Central Transept, the great length\r\nof the building, and the general aërial appearance of the whole crystal\r\nfabric, produce an effect which, for novelty and lightness, surpasses\r\nevery other architectural elevation in the world. Turning his back upon\r\nthe building, the visitor beholds on either side of him green undulating\r\nlawns, beds planted with rhododendrons and other flowers, and winding\r\ngravel walks. He now surveys the mixed garden, before mentioned, which\r\nextends throughout the south side. To the right is a mound, surrounded\r\nby an arcade of arabesque iron-work, around which innumerable roses are\r\ntwined; and, to the left, two spreading cedar trees--of a kind familiar\r\nto this neighbourhood--attract attention by their thick, spreading,\r\nsombre foliage. Descending the steps, and walking down the broad gravel\r\npath, the visitor reaches the large Circular Fountain. Round the basin\r\nof the fountain are white marble statues, copies from the antique, and\r\nof works by Thorwaldsen and Canova. Amongst them will be found the\r\ncelebrated Farnese Hercules, the free and graceful Mercury by\r\nThorwaldsen, the Venus of Milo, and the Paris by Canova. On either hand,\r\nand a little below the Central Fountain, will be remarked two temples of\r\nbeautiful iron-work, called the Temples of the Cascades, which, with the\r\nfountains, will be more fully described hereafter. Having made one half\r\nof the circle, the visitor, instead of proceeding down the central\r\navenue, turns to the left, round the other side of the Central Fountain,\r\nand passing the first outlet, finds his way through the second, and\r\ndescends the steps into a gently rising walk, which leads him to a\r\nsmaller fountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cedar Trees.]\r\n\r\nKeeping to the left-hand side, we make half the circle of this smaller\r\nfountain, and then enter upon a pleasant path, on the right side of\r\nwhich stands one of the noble cedar-trees before mentioned. We are now\r\nquitting the mixed Italian and English gardens for the pure English\r\nlandscape. Trees wave their long branches over our heads, the paths\r\nwind, and art recedes before nature. Travelling for a short distance, we\r\ncome to a junction of two roads. Selecting the left, we journey on\r\nthrough a path, still gently rising, bordered on one side by trees, and\r\non the other by a lawn, until we approach a valley at the bottom of\r\nwhich is a small piece of water, lying close to a thicket forming a\r\npleasant summer shade. Leading out of this small piece of water is seen\r\na large lake, which forms the second or intermediate reservoir for the\r\nsupply of the fountains. Under the hand of Sir Joseph Paxton the lake is\r\nmade to serve for ornament as well as use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View in Grounds.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHERY GROUND.\r\n\r\nOn the slope, which is here picturesquely bordered with trees, is the\r\nArchery Ground. The targets are fixed at various distances on the lawn,\r\nand in a marquee, pitched in a proper position, are kept bows and arrows\r\nand all needful appliances of the noble pastime of archery--once the\r\nmilitary stay and boast of the English nation, now, in these days of\r\ngunpowder, the pleasing and vigorous recreation of ladies and civilians.\r\n\r\nPursuing our way along the path, and which is now open on both sides, we\r\ndescend towards the east, and on either side of us are beds filled with\r\nAmerican rhododendrons. Our road takes us along the edge of the lake.\r\nBearing to the right, we presently reach the junction of two paths. If\r\nthe visitor turns to the left, he enters the Park, which occupies this\r\nside of the ground, and forms not one of the least agreeable features of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STONE ARCADE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRICKET GROUND.\r\n\r\nIn the Park, a little to the right of the Sydenham entrance, and between\r\nthat and the Great Central Walk, is a spacious level of green turf,\r\nwhich is specially laid out as a cricketing ground, and which is one of\r\nthe best and largest in England. Every necessary arrangement is made,\r\nduring the season, for the interesting matches and practice of this\r\nessentially English game. Close by is a ground for Rifle practice.\r\n\r\nQuitting the Cricket Ground, the visitor returns on the same path by\r\nwhich he has approached, to the Great Fountain Basin, proceeding round\r\nthe left-hand margin of which he will arrive where the broad Central\r\nWalk divides the two basins, from which point he obtains an excellent\r\nview of the stone Arcades, over which the water from the Temples and\r\nCascades rushes in a glittering span of many feet, and forms splendid\r\nfalls into the basins below. The pathway passes under the stone Arcades,\r\nand, when the water is pouring over, a curious and beautiful effect is\r\nnoticeable from the open balustrade, in front of which the water passes.\r\nHaving inspected the Arcades, the visitor continues his walk, partly\r\nround the next fountain basin, till he reaches a flight of steps on the\r\nleft hand, passing up which he gains the Grand Plateau, which is 47 feet\r\nabove the level of the Lake, which lies below.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATIONS AND THE EXTINCT ANIMALS.[27]\r\n\r\nFrom our stand on the Grand Plateau, which is fifty feet in width, we\r\nobtain a general view of a tract of several acres of ground occupied by\r\nGeological illustrations, and including a number of islands partly\r\ncovered by strange figures, the restored forms of various animals which\r\nfor many ages have ceased to exist as living tribes.\r\n\r\n  [27] See “Handbook to the Extinct Animals and Geological Illustrations\r\n  described,” by Professor Owen.\r\n\r\nThe wonders of geology are not confined to grand mountain chains\r\npiercing the clouds, burning mountains vomiting steam and hot ashes, and\r\nvast accumulations of animal and vegetable remains found imbedded\r\neverywhere around us. They extend to facts connected with the structure\r\nof the earth’s crust, the existence of stores of mineral wealth, and\r\nstrange results derived from the comparison of existing races with the\r\nfragments of other races formerly occupying the surface. The form of the\r\nsurface depends on the internal structure; the scenery is due to the\r\ncircumstances of the prevailing rock and soil; and the sea-cliff and\r\nnaked mountain side are the places where nature teaches her first great\r\nlesson of the natural history of the Mineral Kingdom. To illustrate\r\ngeology, it was necessary to perform the same kind of task as that which\r\nhas been so successfully performed in the Architectural Courts, and the\r\nresult is now before the visitor, as he looks down from this plateau and\r\nprepares to enter on the new course of investigation open to him. The\r\nground forming the cliffs, shores, banks, and islands in this part of\r\nthe Park are so constructed as to give, in a series of views, a number\r\nof practical lessons in geology, tending to make the essential facts of\r\nthe science easily understood, while, at the same time, they add to the\r\npicturesque beauty of the scenery. The plan may be recognised in the\r\nfine expanse of cliff now at our feet; to do justice to which we must\r\ndescend and place ourselves on the tongue of land below, or on the\r\nrustic bridge a little to the left. From hence may be seen the full\r\nlength of the present cliff, and a few words of explanation will be\r\nsufficient to indicate the succession of rocks and the geological\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nOn this cliff, the part immediately facing the bridge represents a\r\nsection nearly vertical of part of a coal-field, all the beds _dipping_\r\n(or inclining) at a moderate angle to the right-hand, so that those to\r\nthe left are lower in geological position, though they gradually become\r\nhigher in point of actual elevation, and at a little distance further to\r\nthe left overtop the coal itself. Besides this illustration, we also see\r\nin the same equal part of the cliff instances of _faults_ or _troubles_,\r\nthrowing a part of the coal-measures into a different position from the\r\nrest, and lifting up portions of a series of deposits. In the case\r\nbefore us, the older rocks are also thrown up on the left side of the\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nThe coal-cliff consists of two beds or seams of coal, two of ironstone,\r\nand some sandstone. The part not consisting of projecting stone is\r\nsupposed to represent softer rocks, clays, or shales. There are placed\r\nhere about twenty-five tons of coal, twenty tons of grit or sandstone,\r\nand five tons of ironstone, all from the neighbourhood of Clay Cross.\r\n\r\nIn order to produce a marked contrast, the carboniferous limestone is\r\nplaced next in order, and as if brought up to its position by a\r\nconsiderable fault. The millstone grit, appearing on the top of the\r\nplateau above the limestone, would have occupied naturally and without\r\ndisturbance, a position below the lowest part of the coal measures. The\r\nfault is therefore called, technically, an upthrow or upcast to the\r\nsouth. The millstone grit consists of about 30 tons of rock from Crick,\r\nnear Matlock, and from Bramley Fall quarries, in Yorkshire. The\r\ncarboniferous limestone (of which there is 100 tons) is from the\r\nneighbourhood of Matlock, and is placed nearly in its natural position.\r\n\r\nIn this cliff of carboniferous limestone the bedding may be very\r\ndistinctly traced, and systems of fissures, or _joints_, may also be\r\nobserved. One of these fissures, wider than the rest and communicating\r\nwith several smaller ones, is partly filled with spar, and has an\r\nopening into a cavern constructed behind the cliff. The main fissure\r\nrepresents a _mineral vein_ or _lode_, and the smaller ones are\r\n_strings_ or _feeders_. Within the cavern the spectator sees some of the\r\npeculiar and interesting appearances of natural limestone grottoes.\r\n\r\nComing out below the limestone, hard beds of the _old red sandstone_ are\r\nseen. These have the same dip as the limestones, and are seen at\r\nintervals further to the left towards the railway. It is intended to\r\ncontinue the series of older and altered rocks in this direction. The\r\nold red sandstone on the ground consists of about twenty tons from near\r\nBristol.\r\n\r\nOverlying this whole series of old (or palæozoic) rocks, which are\r\ninclined to the north, is a horizontal, and therefore unconformable\r\ncapping of _new red sandstone_. This also is from near Bristol, and the\r\nquantity provided was fifty tons.\r\n\r\nThe new red sandstone, thus capping the old rock on the high ground of\r\nthe plateau, re-appears at the extremity of the nearest of the adjacent\r\nislands at a much lower level, and having a different mechanical\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIt is right to mention that these geological sketches are the result of\r\ncareful consideration, and have not been effected without much\r\nconstructive ingenuity. The original plan of the whole was suggested by\r\nProfessor Ansted, and arranged with Sir Joseph Paxton at an early period\r\nof the laying out of the grounds; and as soon as the state of affairs\r\npermitted and the actual earthworks of the Plateau were in progress, a\r\nmodel of the intended structure was completed and coloured geologically\r\nby Professor Ansted. The works have been ably constructed from this\r\nmodel by Mr. James Campbell, who also procured the stone and other\r\nminerals from different parts of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Labyrinthodons.]\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the Plateau, from whence we can obtain the best\r\nview of the islands and their singular tenants. Before describing them,\r\nhowever, we will remind the visitor that the lowest or oldest rocks,\r\nwhich we have shown him, were the old red sandstone; next above them\r\nwere the carboniferous limestone, the millstone grit, the coal-measures,\r\nand then the new red sandstone. It is with this last formation that the\r\nrestorations of the extinct animals commence. Before that period fossil\r\nremains indicate that fish inhabited the waters of the earth, but there\r\nare no traces of the existence of any reptiles or higher animals.\r\nReptiles first appear in the new red sandstone, and as the extreme right\r\nof the islands is arranged to represent this formation, it is there that\r\nwe shall find the Labyrinthodon and the Dicynodon, of each of which\r\nthere are two species. The strata which overlie the new red sandstone\r\nwill be now mentioned in the order of their super-position, each\r\nsuccessive formation bringing us nearer to the forms of animal life\r\nwhich are at present living upon the earth.\r\n\r\nNext above the new red sandstone comes the lias, the general direction\r\nof the inclination of the beds being the same as in the coal-cliff, and\r\nthe newer beds covering up the old ones as we advance in the direction\r\nof the larger islands. The lias animals are here represented by three\r\nvery dissimilar forms; there are three species of _Ichthyosaurus_, or\r\nFish Lizard; three species of _Plesiosaurus_, or Serpent Lizard, and a\r\ncrocodilian beast called _Teleosaurus_, which much resembles the\r\nfish-eating Gavial of the river Ganges. This crocodile and the fish\r\nlizards formerly inhabited the neighbourhood of Whitby in Yorkshire,\r\nwhere their remains are found in good condition. Dr. Buckland describes\r\nthe _Plesiosaurus_ as the most singular and monstrous of the relics of\r\nthe former world, having the head of a lizard, the teeth of a crocodile,\r\na neck like the body of a serpent, the trunk and tail of an ordinary\r\nquadruped, the ribs of a chameleon, and the paddles of a whale.\r\n\r\nThe next formation in ascending order is the oolite. To this stratum, as\r\nwell as to the succeeding one, belongs the _Megalosaurus_, or Gigantic\r\nLizard, which measures 39 feet from snout to top of tail, and 22 feet 6\r\ninches round the body, and the smaller Pterodactyles.\r\n\r\nStill proceeding to the left, we pass next to the Wealden formation so\r\nwell known in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. Here we see the gigantic\r\n_Iguanodons_, and the _Hylæosaurus_, or Great Spiny Lizard of the\r\nWealden. It is with these creatures that the name of the late\r\ndistinguished palæontologist, Dr. Mantell, will ever be connected, since\r\nto his labours in Tilgate Forest and other parts we are indebted for our\r\nknowledge of these animals.\r\n\r\nAbove the Wealden formation come those of the lower greensand and the\r\nchalk. Both of these also contain fragments of singular reptiles of\r\nlarge size, the _Mosasaurus_ and great Pterodactyles (most probably the\r\nfabled dragon of old) restored from Mr. Bowerbank’s specimens.\r\n\r\nWith these we quit the Secondary Island, and may next turn our attention\r\nto the island beyond, which contains the principal forms characterising\r\nthe strata belonging to the tertiary period. Hitherto we have shown the\r\nvisitor nothing but reptiles--now, upon the Tertiary Island, he will\r\nfind a higher order of animal life, and meet with forms more nearly\r\nresembling our living animals. Next in procession are the animals\r\nrestored by Baron Cuvier from fragments found in the Gypsum beds of the\r\nParis basin: the _Palæotherium_, or Ancient Beast, might be justly\r\ncalled the first triumph of comparative anatomy, as from a few detached\r\npieces of bone Cuvier was enabled to construct the entire animal, which,\r\nby his drawings, appears to have resembled the Tapir of the present day.\r\nAfter these come the more elegant pachydermatous animal called the\r\n_Anoplotherium commune_ and the _Anoplotherium gracilis_, and not far\r\noff we see the _Megatherium_, or Gigantic Sloth, in the act of pulling\r\ndown a tree to obtain the leaves, upon which it was accustomed to feed,\r\nas its smaller analogies do at the present day. These, with the Irish\r\nElks, first found in the Isle of Man, are grouped upon this island, and\r\npresent a scene equally remarkable and instructive to all those who are\r\ninterested in the natural history of the earlier periods of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Great Pterodactyles.]\r\n\r\nNo one can look upon all these singular and bulky productions, so unlike\r\nthe comparatively familiar forms of even the rarer living animals, and\r\nyet with so much appearance of reality, without at once becoming\r\nsensible that a series of illustrations is before him, of a nature\r\naltogether different from any he has been accustomed to.\r\n\r\nThe footmarks, the bones, the very skin in some cases, of animals long\r\nsince extinct, have been preserved by being buried in mud which has\r\nafterwards been converted into solid rock. From these obscure guides,\r\nthe comparative anatomist has ventured to describe the general form, the\r\nhabits, and the peculiarities of the race. From such descriptions,\r\npenned chiefly by Cuvier, Mantell, and Owen, has Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins\r\nrestored and by degrees built up the animals. Possessing a great\r\nknowledge of the peculiarities of many living species; and being strong\r\nin his own feeling of what was probable and natural in the numerous\r\ndetails that required consideration, he has skilfully and cautiously\r\nconstructed these restorations, and his embodiments of the opinions of\r\nthe greatest palæontologists are indeed equally bold and conscientious.\r\nProfessor Owen, the most eminent living authority upon these subjects,\r\nhas kindly rendered Mr. Hawkins every assistance in his undertaking.\r\n\r\nRe-descending from the Plateau once more to the large fountain, the\r\nvisitor turns to the left, and proceeds round its margin until he\r\narrives at the further end of the basin, where he will notice an\r\nornamental cataract is contrived. On the left-hand of the path which\r\nwinds from this point, is a high bank constructed of roots of the trees\r\nwhich grew in the woods once covering a great part of the Crystal Palace\r\ngardens. The effect is very striking and picturesque, being greatly\r\naided by the wild flowers which grow so luxuriantly on all parts. It\r\nwill have been noticed that round the confines of the lake we have just\r\nquitted, where the geological restorations are, the flowers are\r\npurposely nearly all wild ones, and they give a singularly natural and\r\nfit appearance to this interesting district. It must be mentioned that\r\nthe whole of the Crystal Palace Exterior Gardens are under the personal\r\nsuperintendence of Mr. Edward Milner, and it will be confessed their\r\nbeautiful condition answers to his assiduous care. A few steps further,\r\nand the visitor arrives at the junction of two roads. Selecting that to\r\nthe left, he will speedily gain the foot of the Rosary, and the mound,\r\nat the top of which is an ornamental arabesque arcade designed by Mr.\r\nOwen Jones. He will here find roses of every variety, besides other\r\nplants which climb the sides and around the roof of the arcade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Secondary Island.\r\n\r\n   1.

Labyrinthodon Pachygnathus.]\r\n\r\nProceeding round the Rosary to the right, we quit the mound at the\r\nsecond outlet, and journey along a path, on either side of which are\r\nflower-beds and groups of Rhododendrons and Azaleas. Bearing to the\r\nright we reach the basin of a fountain. Choosing the left-hand side of\r\nthis basin, we turn into the broad walk which leads us by means of a\r\nflight of steps to the second terrace, crossing which we make our way by\r\nthe steps to the upper terrace.\r\n\r\nAt this point the visitor can either re-enter the Palace under the\r\nCentral Transept, or by proceeding to the left-hand down the terrace,\r\nenter the south wing and pass down the colonnade to the Railway Station.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRYSTAL TOWERS.\r\n\r\nThe high towers, of which there are two, one at each end of the\r\nbuilding, have been erected for the purpose of raising the tanks from\r\nwhich the high jets of the great fountains in the lower basins are\r\nplayed, and are, with the exception of the tank and stays, constructed\r\nof cast iron.\r\n\r\nThe foundation upon which this enormous mass of material rests, is\r\nnecessarily very strong, and consists, in the first place, of a ring of\r\nconcrete, sixty feet in external diameter, and three feet deep; upon\r\nthis is built a circular wall of brick-work, laid in cement, fifty-six\r\nfeet in diameter, and eighteen feet deep. This forms the bed on which\r\nrests the base pieces of the columns.\r\n\r\nThe columns, 1 foot in diameter, and 24 in number, are placed in pairs,\r\n4 feet apart, and are connected together by solid vertical girders or\r\nfilling-in frames, each pair thus forming one continuous broad column,\r\nextending from the base to the bottom of the tank by which the tower is\r\nsurmounted; the whole rising to a height of 202 feet. The space between\r\neach pair of columns (8 feet) is filled in with glazed sashes and\r\nface-work, corresponding with those in the building, and completing the\r\nshell of the tower. Behind these sashes, and spanning these spaces,\r\nextending from floor to floor, are series of round wrought-iron diagonal\r\nbracing, continued from the bottom to the top of the tower; and, under\r\neach of the ten landing-floors, is a strong horizontal bracing-plate,\r\ntermed a diaphragm, forming, with the diagonal bracing above referred\r\nto, a system of vertical and horizontal trussing.\r\n\r\nUp the centre of each tower is carried a perpendicular brick shaft (the\r\ninternal diameter of which is 7 ft. 9 in.), resting upon a separate\r\nfoundation, and serving the double purpose of carrying off the smoke\r\nfrom the heating apparatus, from the boilers connected with the\r\nMachinery Department, the upper engine-house, and kitchen, and forming\r\nthe core or spiral staircase by which the various floors, and gallery at\r\nthe top of the tower, are reached. These floors arise at intervals of\r\ntwenty feet from the level of the floor of the main building. The tank\r\nnoticed above is of boiler-plate, and is formed of an inner and outer\r\nwall, the former of which encircles the chimney-shaft; the bottom, which\r\nis dome-shaped, is carried upon wrought-iron girders radiating from the\r\nchimney, and is secured to the tops of the external columns. This\r\ndescription will be more readily understood when the depths of the tank\r\nat its outer and inner walls are given. The former, or that resting upon\r\nthe external columns, being 38 feet, while the latter, next the\r\nchimney-shaft, is about 26 feet. These tanks are calculated to hold,\r\nwhen filled, a body of water of the enormous weight of 1,576 tons, or a\r\nbulk of 57,228 cubic feet, equal to 357,675 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe supply is forced from the upper reservoir by the same engines that\r\nraise the water to the lower water-tanks and the building; and the same\r\npipes form also the means of conveying the water to the fountains. They\r\nare arranged within the outer columns, forming an interior circle,\r\napparently of columns, but rendering in reality no assistance towards\r\nthe stability of the structure.\r\n\r\nOn a level with the base of the tank, projecting from the exterior of\r\nthe tower, and carried on strong and elegant cast-iron brackets, is the\r\ngallery six feet in width, from the outer edge of which, on light iron\r\ncolumns, is carried the many-gabled conical Paxton roof which covers the\r\ntower. The total height of these stupendous edifices, from the ground\r\nline to the top ornaments on the roof, is 284 feet. From the same ground\r\nline to the floor of the projecting gallery is 214 feet, involving to\r\nthe persevering visitor an ascent of no fewer than 400 steps, with only\r\nten landings or rests on the floors previously mentioned. The reward in\r\nthe prospect afforded will, however, amply repay the toil incurred,\r\nembracing as it does an horizon including part of six counties--viz.,\r\nMiddlesex, Kent, Essex, Bedfordshire, and Bucks--and including a\r\npanorama possessing, amongst other objects of interest, the Towers of\r\nLondon and Windsor, the woodlands of Essex, and the Downs of Epsom. The\r\nvision of the visitor from this height is also lifted over the grand\r\nplateau, or ridge, which separates the great lake with its antediluvian\r\nanimals from the rest of the garden.\r\n\r\nThese magnificent towers, each of which contains 800 tons of iron, were\r\ndesigned by Mr. Brunel.\r\n\r\nFrom the above simple statement it will be seen, that the arrangements\r\nfor supplying the fountains with water are at once simple, complete, and\r\nbased upon the most economical principles. The engine power employed is\r\nthat of three hundred and twenty horses; the water itself is conveyed to\r\nand from the reservoirs in pipes varying from three feet to one inch in\r\ndiameter; and the total weight of piping may be set down at 4000 tons,\r\nits length, roughly estimated, at ten miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTESIAN WELL, AND THE WATER SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1852, the supply of water for the fountains and other great\r\nworks in connexion with the Crystal Palace, first seriously engaged the\r\nattention of the Directors. Various proposals were made, and suggestions\r\noffered: some were at once rejected; others, although not free from\r\ndifficulties, were taken into consideration. The most feasible of these\r\nwas that which involved the extension to Sydenham of the pipes of one of\r\nthe nearest London water-work companies,--a measure that would at once\r\nsecure a sufficient supply of tolerably good water. Against the\r\nproposition for sinking a well on the grounds, it was urged that the\r\nneighbourhood is almost destitute of water; that wells already excavated\r\nto the depth of two hundred feet had yielded but a small supply; and\r\nthat even if a sufficient supply could be secured by digging, the water\r\nobtained could never be raised to the top of the hill.\r\n\r\nActing, however, upon sound advice, and after due consideration, the\r\ncompany commenced the sinking of an artesian well at the foot of the\r\nhill on which the Palace stands, and after proceeding to a depth of 250\r\nfeet, their efforts were rewarded.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the water which appears in the well comes from a\r\nreservoir lying between the London clay and the greensand as its upper\r\nand lower envelopes. This reservoir is supplied by rain-water, which,\r\npercolating the London clay, sand, and chalk, and finding an impediment\r\nto its downward progress on reaching the greensand, flows into the space\r\nbetween the hard clay and greensand, as into a cistern. The process by\r\nwhich the reservoir is supplied is continuous, the water finding its way\r\ndown to it as if by a series of small tubes, and pressing against the\r\nlower surface of the clay with a force which, if unresisted, would raise\r\nit to the level from which it descended. When the clay is pierced by the\r\naugur it is evident that this force is free to act, the resistance of\r\nthe clay at the point where it is pierced being removed, and accordingly\r\nthe water rises in the bore to the level from which it is supplied, and\r\nwill continue to do so as long as the percolation lasts. The chief\r\ndifficulty to be overcome was the great thickness of the substratum of\r\nchalk, which extends, probably, to a depth of about 1000 feet. The well,\r\nnow completed, is a brick shaft 8¹⁄₂ feet in diameter, 247 feet deep,\r\nfrom whence an Artesian bore descends 328 feet, making the entire depth\r\n575 feet. It is situated at the bottom of the Garden, near the Cricket\r\nGround.\r\n\r\nAn abundant supply of water having been brought to the foot of the hill\r\nfrom the well, and the supplies of a neighbouring water-company, it was\r\nnecessary not only to raise it to the top, on a level with the building,\r\nbut also to elevate it to a sufficient height for obtaining the\r\nrequisite pressure for fountains to throw up water to heights varying\r\nfrom 5 to 280 feet. The following is a brief outline of the arrangements\r\nby which these objects are effected:--\r\n\r\nThree reservoirs have been formed at different levels in the grounds,\r\nthe lowest one being on the same level as the largest basins placed\r\nnearly at the base of the hill; the second or intermediate reservoir is\r\nhigher up, and in a line with the basin in the central walk; whilst the\r\nthird or upper reservoir stands on the top of the hill immediately\r\nadjoining the north end of the building. Next to the Artesian Well, an\r\nengine is placed which raises the water required to be permanently\r\nmaintained in the reservoirs and in the basins of the fountains, and\r\nwhich supply or keep up the water that is lost by waste and evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe reservoir on the summit of the hill contains the water required for\r\nthe use of the building, and for the fountains throughout the grounds.\r\nClose to this reservoir is an engine-house, containing the steam-engines\r\nthat raise part of the water into two large tanks erected on columns at\r\nthe north end of the building close to the junction of the Sydenham and\r\nDulwich roads. The columns, twenty-four in number, are of hollowed\r\ncast-iron, one foot in diameter. The central column, which is two feet\r\nin diameter, supporting a portion of the superincumbent weight, and\r\nmaking up the number, twenty-five, is the water-pipe, by which the tank\r\nis fed, and which forms also the conduit to the fountains in the\r\nbuilding, and on the terraces. These two distinct actions of filling the\r\ntank and working the fountains proceed simultaneously through the same\r\npipe. On the top of these columns are massive girders which support the\r\nplates, forming the bottom of the tank. The height from the stone curb\r\nof the reservoir to the bottom of the tank is 65 feet; the tanks are\r\neach 47 feet square by 15 feet deep, and capable of containing 207,000\r\ngallons or about 900 tons of water. They supply also the water required\r\nin the building for the plants and kitchens, and charge the pipes\r\nprovided against casualties from fire. The vast residue of the water in\r\nthe great upper reservoir, in consequence of the sloping character of\r\nthe ground, does not need any help from the engines, but flows direct to\r\nfountains on a lower level, and plays smaller jets. Through the same\r\nconvenience, the waste water from the upper fountains is used a second\r\ntime in the lower fountains.\r\n\r\nThe central or intermediate reservoir collects the waste water from the\r\ndisplays which take place on ordinary days, and which include all the\r\nfountains, save the two largest, and the cascades. Attached to this\r\nreservoir are also engines which pump the water back to the upper\r\nreservoir. The lowest reservoir collects similarly the waste water from\r\nthe displays which take place in the two largest fountains on the days\r\nof great exhibition, and its engines return the water at once to the top\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nThe great system of fountains in the grounds of the Crystal Palace,\r\nthough the most stupendous that the world has ever seen, is designed\r\nwith an unity which greatly enhances, or rather fully displays, its\r\nunrivalled magnificence. The whole system is divided into two series,\r\nthe upper and the lower. The upper series, which consists of the six\r\nbasins adorning the long extent of the second terrace, with the great\r\ncircular fountain in the centre, and the smaller ones on either side of\r\nit, in all, nine fountains, constitutes the display on ordinary\r\noccasions. Beyond these, as we advance down the central path, are the\r\niron Water Temples, from which the water rushes down a series of twelve\r\ncascades, extending for a distance of 600 feet, till it falls over the\r\nstone arcade in the great fountain basins, forming a glittering cataract\r\n120 feet broad, with a fall of thirty feet. The Water Temples with their\r\ncascades and falls, and the two great fountains into the basins of which\r\nthey discharge, constitute the lower series, which is played only on\r\ngrand occasions; but all are part of one design, and each one ministers\r\nto its completeness.\r\n\r\nUnlike most similar works, sculpture has not been used to enhance or\r\nobtain the effect desired. Under any circumstances, water, when thrown\r\nhigh into the air, assumes a graceful and beautiful appearance; no\r\nungentle curves or distortions of form mar its expression of a natural\r\nbeauty, which, though it may be the roaring grandeur of a mighty stream,\r\nor the gentle grace of the smallest jet, bears with it an unspeakable\r\ncharm. In the Crystal Palace Fountains the designs are carried out by\r\nthe water alone, and the sculptural ornamentation is confined to the\r\nmargins of the basins, and, down the sides of the cascades, to some\r\nsmall ornamental bronze fountains of secondary importance.\r\n\r\nThe first six fountains of the upper series which ornament the Italian\r\nGarden on the second terrace throw their highest jets to the height of\r\n90 feet, the lower jets form graceful designs round the bases of these\r\ncolumns of water, and in other parts of the basins. It is so arranged\r\nthat the waste water from these basins is again used for the lowest jets\r\nof the fountains which lie between these and the Water Temples, a rapid\r\ndescent in the ground giving sufficient pressure for this purpose; the\r\nsame is the case with the water flowing from these again, as it is once\r\nmore used for the lower water designs in the great basins.\r\n\r\nThe great circular fountain, which occupies the central position below\r\nthe terraces, is the principal one of the upper series. Its highest\r\ncolumns, which rise in an imposing mass from a gigantic cradle formed by\r\nthe water, attain the altitude of 150 feet. Rising from the surface\r\naround this, are single upright streams which beautifully fill in the\r\ndesign, throwing their spray to almost an equal height. The whole is\r\nsurrounded by a delicate trellis of water, in which the jets appear to\r\ninterlace with one another. On the right and left of this, but in lower\r\npositions, are two smaller circular fountains of great beauty, which,\r\nwith those already described, complete the upper series. The largest\r\ncircular basin is 196 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nWe now approach the two Water Temples which head the cascades on either\r\nside of the broad central walk. These Temples are octagonal in shape,\r\nwith dome-shaped roofs, and are constructed of ornamental ironwork,\r\ngaily coloured and gilded. On the apex of each is a bronze figure, from\r\nbeneath which the water, which is forced up the hollow columns, bursts\r\nin a glittering film till it falls over the roof and down the sides. The\r\nTemples are about 60 feet in height. The head or basin which surrounds\r\neach one, and from which the water flows down the cascades, is a\r\nparallelogram of 72 feet, with semicircular extensions in the two sides\r\nof 18 feet radius. Bronze fountains ornament each side of the cascades.\r\n\r\nThe great fountains are the crowning effect of the whole system, and are\r\nthe largest in the world. The basins, which are designed with a\r\ngraceful and diversified outline, are 784 feet each in length, having a\r\ndiameter in the semicircular centre portion of 468 feet. A great central\r\ncolumn rises in each, streaming upward to the height of 280 feet when\r\nundisturbed by wind. These columns are each composed of 50 two-inch\r\njets, which burst forth under a pressure on the mouth of the pipes of\r\n262 lb. to the square inch. The design is carried out by an infinite\r\nvariety of water display. The effect is gained by the water alone, which\r\nassumes many forms, from the giant and stately column, to the most\r\ndelicate crystal tracery. When the whole system of fountains is\r\ndisplayed, no less than 11,788 jets are in operation, throwing 120,000\r\ngallons per minute. A grand display usually consumes 6,000,000 gallons\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nThese stupendous and magnificent works were designed by Sir Joseph\r\nPaxton, the engineering operations being executed by Mr. W. Shields, the\r\nresident engineer of the Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nEXHIBITORS’ DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF SPACE FOR EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n  A}\r\n  B} Non-Selling Division.\r\n  C}\r\n\r\n⁂ The Selling Division comprehending the South Gallery and the Galleries\r\non the South-Eastern side are devoted to Miscellaneous Articles.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO ADVERTISEMENTS.\r\n\r\n  GROUND FLOOR:--SOUTH-WEST SIDE:                                   Page\r\n    STATIONERY COURT.--COURT OF INVENTIONS                           179\r\n    HARDWARE COURT                                                   180\r\n    BIRMINGHAM COURT                                                 181\r\n    SHEFFIELD COURT.--MINERAL MANUFACTURES COURT.--HEATH’S BATH\r\n    WHEEL CHAIR DEPARTMENT                                           182\r\n\r\n  GROUND FLOOR:--SOUTH-EAST SIDE:\r\n    FOREIGN GLASS MANUFACTURES COURT                                 182\r\n\r\n  FRENCH COURT:--CARRIAGE DEPARTMENT                                 183\r\n\r\n  EAST GALLERY:--CENTRAL TRANSEPT                                    184\r\n\r\n  SOUTH-EAST GALLERY                                                 185\r\n\r\n  SOUTH GALLERY:--PICTURE GALLERY                                    186\r\n\r\n  WEST GALLERY:--CENTRAL TRANSEPT                                    187\r\n\r\n  NORTH TRANSEPT:--TROPICAL DEPARTMENT                               189\r\n\r\n  BASEMENT:\r\n    MACHINERY                                                        189\r\n    AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS                                          190\r\n\r\n\r\nEXHIBITORS’ DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nStationery Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SPECIMENS of ORNAMENTAL DESIGN for BOOK-BINDING, &c.

Specimens of Chromo-Lithography.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NATURE PRINTING.--The specimens exhibited of this new process for\r\n  obtaining life-like or physiotypic impressions of plants are mostly of\r\n  FERNS and MOSSES, but the process is still further peculiarly\r\n  applicable to the representation of the GRASSES, the LICHENS, and the\r\n  SEA-WEEDS. These results are obtained by placing the specimen to be\r\n  copied upon a plate of soft lead, with a highly-polished surface, and\r\n  passing it, at a high pressure, between hard steel rollers. The\r\n  specimen leaves its impression upon the lead, and gives not only its\r\n  outline, but also the most delicate elevations and depressions of its\r\n  surface with that sharpness and fidelity as to present a _perfect\r\n  fac-simile_ of the original specimen in its natural size. The lead\r\n  plate thus impressed--not being practically available for printing\r\n  purposes--is copied by the electrotype process, by which a copper\r\n  plate (the image on which is perfectly identical with the original\r\n  impressed lead plate) is obtained, which can be printed from at an\r\n  ordinary copper-plate press.\r\n\r\n  NATURE PRINTING was introduced into England by Mr. HENRY BRADBURY, in\r\n  1853; the first application of the process has been most successfully\r\n  exemplified by him in the magnificent folio Edition of “THE FERNS OF\r\n  GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND,” NATURE PRINTED.

Man looks at\r\nhis own image with a more feeling curiosity than he regards the\r\narchitectural remains of a city, however ancient, or of any structure,\r\nhowever beautiful. The broad brow of the poet whose works we have read,\r\nor the martial air of the soldier whose deeds we have heard, excite an\r\ninstant desire for more intimate acquaintance with the men; and such\r\nacquaintance can never be formed without lasting advantage to all who\r\nare susceptible of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the present small volume have prevented my doing more than\r\nrecord, as briefly as I might, the salient points in the characters of\r\nthe various personages whose statues and busts constitute the Portrait\r\nGallery of the Crystal Palace; but I trust sufficient has been done to\r\nthrow a little light upon the various features which the visitor will\r\ncontemplate on his pleasant journey, and to indicate, however\r\nindistinctly, the universal path which, in life itself, leads to all\r\ntrue greatness. A portrait gallery exhibits the men who have worked\r\ntheir way to eminence. Biography teaches how they travelled the\r\ndifficult and thorny road.\r\n\r\nThe collection of Statues and Busts in the Crystal Palace is necessarily\r\nimperfect; but it begins with a goodly array. It is the intention of the\r\nDirectors to extend and, as far as the nature of the subject allows,\r\ncomplete it; and there can be no doubt that we have already the elements\r\nof one of the finest portrait galleries in Europe.\r\n\r\nI desire in this place to express my thanks to my friend M. Regnier, the\r\neminent French comedian, to whose kindness I am indebted for much\r\ninformation in connexion with the French busts. I am also anxious to\r\nacknowledge the services of my assistant, Mr. Shenton, who, under severe\r\npressure, has rendered me great help in the collecting and verifying of\r\nour interesting materials.\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\n  CRYSTAL PALACE,\r\n  _June, 1854_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n  ANTIQUE PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n  GREEK COURT.\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n  SOUTH SIDE COURT--\r\n    GREEK POETS AND DRAMATISTS                                        13\r\n\r\n  NORTH SIDE COURT--\r\n    GREEK PHILOSOPHERS, STATESMEN, AND GENERALS                       19\r\n\r\n  ROMAN COURT.\r\n    ROMAN EMPERORS                                                    29\r\n\r\n  AVENUE IN FRONT OF ROMAN COURT                                      41\r\n\r\n  COURT OF THE ROMAN LADIES                                           43\r\n\r\n  COURT OF ROMAN GENERALS AND POETS                                   46\r\n\r\n  THE ITALIAN PORTRAITS--\r\n    INTRODUCTION                                                      54\r\n    ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS                                             56\r\n    POETS AND DRAMATISTS                                              69\r\n    SOLDIERS AND STATESMEN                                            76\r\n    PRELATES AND THEOLOGIANS                                          78\r\n    KINGS AND QUEENS                                                  79\r\n\r\n  THE FRENCH PORTRAITS--\r\n    INTRODUCTION                                                      80\r\n    ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS                                             83\r\n    POETS AND DRAMATISTS                                              91\r\n    SCIENTIFIC MEN AND WRITERS                                        98\r\n    SOLDIERS AND STATESMEN                                           109\r\n    PRELATES AND THEOLOGIANS                                         121\r\n    KINGS AND QUEENS                                                 124\r\n\r\n  THE GERMAN PORTRAITS--\r\n    INTRODUCTION                                                     134\r\n    ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS                                            136\r\n    POETS AND DRAMATISTS                                             145\r\n    SCIENTIFIC MEN AND WRITERS                                       149\r\n    SOLDIERS AND STATESMEN                                           157\r\n    PRELATES AND THEOLOGIANS                                         162\r\n    KINGS AND QUEENS                                                 163\r\n\r\n  THE ENGLISH PORTRAITS--\r\n    INTRODUCTION                                                     168\r\n    ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS                                            169\r\n    POETS AND DRAMATISTS                                             179\r\n    SCIENTIFIC MEN AND WRITERS                                       188\r\n    SOLDIERS AND STATESMEN                                           202\r\n    PRELATES AND THEOLOGIANS                                         218\r\n    KINGS AND QUEENS                                                 220\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nPortraiture is associated with the earliest attempts at representing\r\nliving objects, both in sculpture and in painting. Even amongst savages\r\nwe find resemblances, carved or painted, or both, of the human form,\r\ngenerally grotesque, but always presenting an idea of Art. With the\r\nadvance of civilization, the demand for portraits increased, as the\r\nknowledge of the means available for painting and sculpture improved.\r\nMen in authority, or possessed of great wealth, or renowned by deeds of\r\narms and feats of strength, became the first subjects for the art.\r\n\r\nThat the Egyptians early practised portrait-painting, is evident from\r\nthe discovery of mural sculpture, at a date anterior to the time of\r\nRameses, representing painters delineating men and animals, and\r\nsculptors carving out of granite the very figures reproduced in another\r\nmaterial, in the Egyptian Court of the Crystal Palace. Herodotus records\r\nthe fact that Amasis sent his portrait painted on wood to Cyrene as a\r\npresent; and some portraits of this kind were found in the tombs at\r\nThebes. On comparing the heads of Rameses and Amenoph, several of which\r\nare to be seen in the Egyptian court, the individuality of each is at\r\nonce perceived. Rameses has an aquiline nose and thin lips, while\r\nAmenoph has the turned-up nose and thick lips of the African.\r\n\r\nIn Clarac’s “Musée de Sculpture,” are collected many accurate engravings\r\nof the portraits of the Egyptians contained in the Louvre, which,\r\naccording to this authority, are all verified, as many as eighty-six of\r\nthem having their names attached. In the Imperial Library, at Paris,\r\nthere is a collection of a hundred Chinese portraits of great antiquity.\r\nThey were brought from China by the well-known Jesuit missionary, Père\r\nAmeot. Pauthier, author of a History of China, refers to these\r\nportraits, and considers them to be those of celebrated men and women\r\nliving at a period long anterior to Confucius.\r\n\r\nCroesus, King of Lydia, had the image of his baking woman set up in\r\ngold: and Herodotus has preserved the names of two Argive youths, Biton\r\nand Cleobis, who for their piety in drawing their mother, the priestess\r\nof Juno, to the temple, when the oxen for her car in a great solemnity\r\ndid not arrive, had their statues placed by their countrymen at Delphi.\r\n\r\nTo the Greeks, indeed, we owe the finest examples of portraits in\r\nSculpture. Their temples, forums, and other public places, as well as\r\ntheir private dwellings, were ornamented with the busts and statues of\r\nheroes, kings, poets, orators, and others distinguished by their\r\nachievements. Many of these examples have fortunately been rescued from\r\ndestruction, and preserved to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, although not themselves, either by the gift of Heaven, or by\r\ntheir own tastes, artists, were great patrons of art. Many a rich Roman\r\ncitizen had the court of his house converted into a kind of forum, which\r\nhe adorned with his favourite portrait statues. From the precious ruins\r\nof Ancient Rome--from her temples, palaces, villas--countless statues\r\nand busts have been dug out. Her tombs also were furnished with\r\nportraits, busts, and statues, recumbent, or in other postures.\r\n\r\nIn all times, and in all countries, we note a desire to perpetuate the\r\nmemory of the dead; and the pious as well as humane intention was\r\ncarried out in various ways. The Egyptians enclosed their mummies in\r\nwooden and stone cases, carved and painted in order to resemble, more or\r\nless, the inhabitant within. The tombs of Etruria are usually surmounted\r\nby a half recumbent statue, which although but rudely representing the\r\nfeatures and attitude of life, clearly reveal the intention to produce a\r\nportrait of the deceased person, but never--which became the custom in\r\nafter ages--as though he were dead.\r\n\r\nFrom the employment of sculptured portraits upon the monuments of the\r\ndead, and from the use of other images in the funeral rites, such\r\nrepresentations came to be called “busts,” from the Latin word\r\n_Bustum_, signifying a tomb, or rather place where the burning of the\r\nbody took place. Since the majority of persons could not afford a\r\nstatue, the less expensive memorial, consisting of the head and\r\nshoulders, was the more generally adopted; and hence the name now\r\ncurrent amongst us.\r\n\r\nPortraits played a still more important part in the economy of the\r\nancient Romans. Images, or rather masks, made in wax and representing\r\ntheir ancestors, were kept by the Romans in the vestibules of their\r\nhouses, placed in cases formed like temples, and there constantly\r\nexposed to the notice of the family and of visitors. When a member of\r\nthe family died, these masks were worn by the friends who assisted at\r\nthe funeral, as were the dresses and robes of office belonging to the\r\nancestors whom they personated. After the ceremony, the images were\r\nfaithfully restored to their sanctuaries in the vestibule.\r\n\r\nAnother use of portraiture was originally peculiar to the Greeks, but it\r\nbecame subsequently adopted by other nations. We refer to the practice\r\nof painting upon a metal shield the portraits of a family--often with\r\nthe father in the centre--and of hanging it up as sacred to the gods.\r\nThere are similar portraits extant, in _terracotta_, of Demosthenes in\r\nexile at Calauria, and of Thales. The ancients also painted portraits on\r\nwood in encaustic, and some portraits formed in mosaic still exist.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the growth of luxury, and to the development of the\r\narts, do we find the increased employment of portraiture. Every kind of\r\nwork was decorated with a portrait. This was especially the usage of the\r\nGreeks under the successors of Alexander, at Alexandria, Antioch, and\r\nPergamus; and with the Romans, towards the close of the Republic, and\r\nunder the Emperors.\r\n\r\nEngraved stones of seals and rings are exceedingly valuable in enabling\r\nus to identify antique busts and statues; their hardness having\r\npreserved them from injury. Very frequently they give the impression of\r\nbeing most accurate portraits. In the Greek Court is a large collection\r\nof casts of these extremely interesting works, which merit careful\r\nexamination. Many of the heads are wonderfully beautiful--far surpassing\r\nin execution any similar work of the present time.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the portraits upon coins, being connected with writing,\r\nhave been most useful in contributing to the knowledge and naming of\r\nantique busts and statues. Of these illustrations also, the visitor is\r\nenabled to study a very complete series from very early times.\r\n\r\nThe universal taste for portraiture exhibited by the ancients, and the\r\nencouragement to art which the vast wealth of many enabled them to\r\nafford, soon led to the formation of a gallery of portraits in every\r\nhouse of importance. Such a gallery contained portraits, both sculptured\r\nand painted, of great men in art, science, letters, and arms, and was\r\ncalled “The _Pinacotheca_.” The desire to render such a collection as\r\ncomplete as possible, led to the production of an infinite number of\r\ncopies from those originally taken from the life: just as with us,\r\nhouses are adorned with plaster-casts of the busts of Wellington,\r\nShakspeare, and Milton.\r\n\r\nIt will now be understood how it has happened that so large a number of\r\nportrait-busts have remained to us from antiquity. Unless they had been\r\nmultiplied in the manner described, the acts of ignorance and the\r\naccidents of time would have effaced all record of the features and\r\naspect of the good and great in ancient story. Most of the works,\r\nexecuted in metal, were melted down and converted into money. One\r\nvaluable mine, however, was happily discovered in the ruins of\r\nHerculaneum, completely preserved, and was removed to the Museum at\r\nNaples, where it still exists. Of several, so recovered, we possess fine\r\ncopies in the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Hadrian in Rome (A.D. 120), art enjoyed a revival--a\r\nMedicean period. A multitude of works of every kind were produced, and\r\nportraiture was carried to its height through the very zealous loyalty\r\nto which sculptors gave way, in their desire to flatter their imperial\r\nand magnificent patron, by representing the members of his family as so\r\nmany gods and goddesses. The like encouragement was afforded under the\r\ndominion of Antoninus Pius (A.D. 140), and his adopted son, Marcus\r\nAurelius; followed, unfortunately, by the destructive propensities of\r\nthe odious Commodus, who would have limited portraiture to the\r\nrepresentation of his own face.\r\n\r\nWe see the first efforts of portraiture in Christian art, in the\r\nrepresentations--sculptured and painted--of saints in the early ages of\r\nthe faith. Some examples of these will be found in the Byzantine and\r\nMediæval Courts. A certain conventional form was adhered to in all these\r\nworks, in which we remark especially a general elongation of the face\r\nand features, as if the aim had been to impress upon them the natural\r\neffects of emaciation from penance and fasting, the body and limbs being\r\nalso subjected to the same treatment. The eyes are always almond-shaped,\r\nhalf closed, and sloping upwards from the nose. The portraits of\r\nJustinian, Theodora, Nicephorus, and Charles the Bald, on the façade of\r\nthe Byzantine Court, bear evidence of their authenticity.\r\n\r\nIn forming our idea of an individual portrait painted in the early\r\nChristian period, we must never forget to allow for the formalities by\r\nwhich an artist of that time was inexorably directed. Statues and\r\npictures were then produced (as indeed they are to this day by the monks\r\nof Mount Athos,) in accordance with rule and system--a sort of holy\r\nheraldry. At the time of which we now speak, we trace no general and\r\npopular use of portraits, such as we observed amongst the ancients,\r\nalthough they were still to be found in the hands of the most wealthy\r\nand cultivated. These were of an expensive kind, in mosaic and in\r\nminiature painting, the latter style being frequently employed when a\r\nvaluable manuscript or missal was copied for presentation, and a\r\nportrait of the author or donor was usually painted upon it.\r\n\r\nMediæval portraiture shows a considerable advance upon the Byzantine,\r\nbut is still inferior to the antique and to the portraiture of our own\r\ntime. It was confined, almost exclusively, to monumental effigies, in\r\nwhich the artist was constrained to present the lifeless form, in the\r\nstiffness of very death--whether sleeping the sleep of eternal peace, or\r\nkneeling in the attitude of prayer. Some of the finest examples are to\r\nbe seen in the Mediæval Court: of these more than one are doubtless\r\nportrait-statues of the time. The same may be said of some of the\r\neffigies of the Knights Templar, which exhibit great individuality,\r\nhaving been executed in a very hard kind of marble, that has well\r\nretained the features originally carved out of it. Busts of this period\r\nare exceedingly rare; inasmuch as portraiture of the kind was not in\r\naccordance with the religious feeling of the age. We must be content to\r\ntake the effigies of mediæval art as portraits of the time; treated, of\r\ncourse, after certain conventionalities, but nevertheless truthful and\r\nmost interesting.\r\n\r\nThe art of portraiture revived under the creative genius of Giotto and\r\nOrcagna, and of the great men of the _Renaissance_--Domenico Ghirlandaio\r\nand Giovanni Bellini--until it reached the highest dignity and beauty in\r\nthe superb works of the mightiest of the mighty Italians--Michael\r\nAngelo, Raffaelle, and Titian. The most remarkable portraits of this\r\nperiod are paintings, and are therefore not to be found in large numbers\r\nin the Crystal Palace. In the beautiful gallery, however, of copies from\r\nthe old masters, will be found several fine examples. In the Renaissance\r\nand Mediæval Courts, will be seen some of the statues from the tombs of\r\nMaximilian and Albert of Saxony--the finest portrait-statues of their\r\nkind. In the Italian Court, too, there are the immortal monumental\r\nstatues of the Medici, and a superb bust of Cosmo de’ Medici by the\r\ninimitable Cellini.\r\n\r\nThe antique statues and busts described in the following pages are from\r\n\r\n  THE VATICAN, AT ROME,\r\n  THE CAPITOLINE MUSEUM,\r\n  THE NAPLES MUSEUM,\r\n  THE FLORENCE GALLERY,\r\n  THE LOUVRE,\r\n  THE BERLIN MUSEUM,\r\n  THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ΗΡΟΔΟΤΟΣ.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRAIT GALLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUE PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK COURT.--SOUTH SIDE-COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETS AND DRAMATISTS.\r\n\r\n[28]1. HOMER. _Great Epic Poet of Greece._\r\n\r\n  [Born, probably B.C. 850. Place of birth unknown.]\r\n\r\nA majestic antique Bust. The kingly and venerated Patriarch of all\r\nPoets, for the western civilization--or, the sound of a Name! The two\r\nwonderful poems which bear down this name--whatever signifying--through\r\nthe lapse and revolutions of time, preserve, as it were, the image of an\r\nextinct world: although of a world, perhaps less than half real, and\r\nmore than half ideal:--for the manners _were_: the persons and events\r\nmay, or may not have been: and the gods and goddesses of the “Iliad” and\r\nthe “Odyssey” were, we know, only a believed-in, waking dream. But, by\r\nthe potency of the song, the picture lives! The war, imaginary or no,\r\nraging between the Hellespont and the foot of Mount Ida, remains, to\r\nthe educated memory of the nations, like the beginning--if not of the\r\nworld’s, yet of its western half’s--history. And those heroes and\r\nheroines, with their high actions and their deep passions--the\r\nunrolling, embroidered web of their fortunes and fates:--the king of\r\nmen, Agamemnon,--the swift-footed son of the sea-goddess,\r\nAchilles,---the sage, long-lived Nestor,--the shrewd, enduring\r\nUlysses,--Ajax, a tower in the fight,--Diomed, favoured of Minerva\r\npresent beside him in the storm of spears;--and that grey-headed,\r\nimperial sire of Troy, with all his falling sons, Priam,--the gallant\r\nand good Hector,--the loving and faithful Andromache,--the aged, too\r\nfruitful mother, Hecuba;--even the fatal and criminal, but divinely\r\nbeautiful Helen--Is it not a strange magic that dwells in the creative\r\nthought of the poet, and in his modulated words, and that thus, in a\r\nlanguage, and with manners, a faith, an age--all so long since dead and\r\ngone--can, as if reviving all, render those Shadows, to us--now,\r\nhere--the earliest objects of a wondering and aspiring enthusiasm:--the\r\nfirst enkindlers in our bosoms of that glowing, intense, comprehensive,\r\nand intelligent sympathy, which transports us out of the central self,\r\nand beyond the close-drawn horizon of our own particular life, to feel\r\nthe conditions and to understand the spirits of all our fellow men? Let\r\nthe theory be true, which denies to these incomparable works an\r\nindividual author--which supposes them woven together of many songs,\r\nfirst sung in many places, by many singers; let the benignly august,\r\nfillet-bound head before us, be--that which only at last it can be--a\r\nconjecture of the Grecian chisel;--we see at least here how the\r\nconsummated art of sculpture has chosen to express, in corporeal form,\r\nthe one soul of power which animates those immortal twins of poesy. We\r\nsee in what shape of a human head, crowned with its own irradiations,\r\nthe fountains of all song might have sprang. We see what the living and\r\nwandering minstrel of Greece, beloved and honoured wheresoever, in hall\r\nor on green, he and his harp came,--what the individual Homer, for whose\r\nbirth seven cities contended, and whom in the after-day the land\r\nnumbered amongst her half-divine and worshipped heroes--WOULD HAVE\r\nBEEN:--or, WAS!\r\n\r\n  [Although modern antiquaries agree with Pliny that busts of Homer are\r\n  apocryphal, yet there can be no doubt this is the true Greek\r\n  conventional portrait of that poet. A headless marble was dug up\r\n  inscribed with his name and shortly afterwards the head itself was\r\n  found in the same hole, and it fitted precisely to the marble\r\n  previously discovered. The bust, so found, is now in the Naples\r\n  Museum. The same head is constantly found in other representations of\r\n  the ancient poet. The head is bound with the “strophium,” an ornament\r\n  given by the Greek artists to their gods and heroes. The attitude of\r\n  the head would seem to express the blindness with which Homer,\r\n  according to tradition, was afflicted. This bust is from the marble in\r\n  the Stanza dei Filosofi of the Capitoline Museum, Rome.]\r\n\r\n  [28] The objects forming the Portrait Gallery in the Crystal Palace,\r\n  are numbered in red figures throughout.\r\n\r\n2. ARCHILOCHUS. _Greek Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Paros, about B.C. 700. Killed in battle, about B.C. 635]\r\n\r\nA satirical poet of great renown, whose acrid pen spared neither friend\r\nnor foe. A writer also of licentious verse. Fragments only of his\r\ncompositions have come down to us. To him is attributed the invention of\r\nthe Iambic measure, and he shares with Thaletas and Terpander the honour\r\nof establishing lyric poetry in Greece. The victors in the Olympic games\r\nwere accustomed to sing one of his hymns in their triumphal procession.\r\nThe countenance of his statue denotes impudent boldness.\r\n\r\n  [The two early poets united: a mode of portraiture adopted by the\r\n  Greek artists when two celebrated men were of the same country, and\r\n  of kindred pursuits, as Herodotus and Thucydides, parallel historians;\r\n  Metrodorus and Epicurus, philosophers of the same sect (see No. 20).\r\n  This double terminal or Janus was found at Rome on the Celian Hill: it\r\n  is now in the Vatican. The ends of the noses are modern, as are some\r\n  other parts in the Homer. That portraits of Archilochus existed so\r\n  long after his death is proved by the existence of an inscription in\r\n  the Analecta of Thucydides written for his portrait.]\r\n\r\n2A. HOMER. _Great Epic Poet of Greece._\r\n\r\n  [For life see No. 1.]\r\n\r\n3. ÆSOP. _Writer of Fables._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Phrygia, about B.C. 620. Died about B.C. 560.]\r\n\r\nThe reputed author of the fables to which his name has been for\r\ncenturies attached. According to the general account, he was originally\r\na slave, and gained much notice for his wit, and especially for his\r\ntalent of communicating useful maxims in the form of apologues. His\r\ntalent procured him favour at the court of Crœsus. He is said to have\r\nbeen thrown from the top of a rock and killed, by the priests of Delphi.\r\nHis fables, at first preserved by tradition, were at a later period\r\nconverted into Greek and Latin verse by Babrias and Phædrus. We have\r\nthem in Greek prose, told naturally and in the utmost simplicity. In\r\nstature Æsop is described as small and hump-backed, with a prominent\r\nstomach and pointed head, yet the intellectual expression of his\r\ncountenance is not that usually given to dwarfs.\r\n\r\n  [From the very remarkable half-figure in marble in the Villa Albani,\r\n  at Rome; the whole of which is of great antiquity. It has been\r\n  maintained that Æsop was not deformed, inasmuch as the circumstance is\r\n  not mentioned by writers, before the time of the Greek monk, Planudes\r\n  Maximus. There are, however, traditions affirming his deformity, and\r\n  Plutarch, in his Feast of the Sages, makes him sit upon a low stool at\r\n  the feet of Solon. The countenance has a thoughtful and elevated\r\n  expression. Lysippus sculptured the portrait of Æsop to be placed\r\n  amongst the sages of Greece at Athens. Phædrus refers to this work,\r\n  and the celebrity of the man is fixed by the fact that the court\r\n  sculptor of Alexander employed himself upon his statue.]\r\n\r\n4. HOMER. _Great Epic Poet of Greece._\r\n\r\n  [From the marble. Once in the Capitoline Museum; now in the Louvre.]\r\n\r\n5. EPIMENIDIES. _Poet and Prophet of Crete._\r\n\r\n  [Flourished about B.C. 596]\r\n\r\nSt. Paul in his Epistle to Titus (i. 12) is supposed to allude to\r\nEpimenides. But little more than his name and existence are known, apart\r\nfrom tradition. About B.C. 596, he was invited to Athens, in order to\r\nstay the plague brought upon the city by an impious outrage committed by\r\nCylon, one of the Athenian rulers, on the altars of the Acropolis.\r\nSucceeding in arresting the pestilence, he augmented his already great\r\nfame--but he refused any other reward beyond the goodwill of the\r\nAthenians in favour of the inhabitants of Gnossus, where he dwelt. He\r\nwas a native of Crete.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Vatican. One of the conventional portraits of\r\n  the ancient Greek poets. The closed eyes are to represent the sleep\r\n  which tradition says he fell into for fifty-seven years.]\r\n\r\n6. ÆSCHYLUS. _Tragic Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Eleusis, in Greece, B.C. 525. Died at Gela, in Sicily, B.C.\r\n  456. Aged 69.]\r\n\r\nThe founder of Greek tragedy as it existed in its greatness. He\r\nintroduced a second actor upon the scene, and gave dramatic interest to\r\nhis act, by rendering dialogue the most important element in the play.\r\nHe improved the masks and dresses of the actors, and raised the\r\ncharacter of the choral dances. The scenes painted under his direction\r\nwere, it is said, the first in which the idea of perspective was\r\nmaintained. Sublimity and magnificence characterize the style of his\r\ntragedies, in which the action and plot, with an unparalleled simplicity\r\nof structure, move on, in commanding and stern strength, to their\r\ncatastrophe; supported by grand imagery, with diction wrested to the\r\nheight of energy and solemn passion. The characters drawn by Æschylus\r\nare as lofty as the language which they speak. We almost yearn for the\r\nsimple voice of Nature as we listen to the sustained thunder-tone of\r\nthis great master. His mind seems ever attuned for discourse with the\r\nGods; yet in the “Prometheus,” though dealing with a demigod, he\r\ndescribes with awful power, human suffering and human passion in its\r\nsaddest and most thrilling aspect. The family of Æschylus were\r\nremarkable for their valour, and he himself fought bravely at Marathon\r\nand Salamis. He was an actor in his own plays.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in Stanza dei Filosofi, of the Capitoline Museum, at\r\n  Rome.]\r\n\r\n7. SOPHOCLES. _Tragic Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Colonus, in Attica, about B.C. 495. Died probably at Athens,\r\n  B.C. 405. Aged 90.]\r\n\r\nIn Sophocles, Æschylus found a rival and a conqueror. When Cimon (B.C.\r\n468) returned from the Isle of Scyros, with the ashes of Theseus, the\r\nfirst play of Sophocles (“Triptolemus”) was preferred to the composition\r\nof Æschylus, who in chagrin retired to Sicily. From this time Sophocles\r\nstood alone, until he, in his turn, met a successful rival in Euripides.\r\nIn 440, he produced “Antigone,” for its calm beauty, and the pure\r\npicture of heroic, feminine self-devotion, one of the finest antique\r\ntragedies extant, and the occasion of his promotion through the favour\r\nof Pericles. In the person of Sophocles was represented the ideal of\r\nGreek perfection. He was very beautiful; he excelled in gymnastics,\r\nmusic, and dancing; in temperament he was calm and contented; in\r\ndisposition kind and cheerful; he had a ready wit, a serene piety, and\r\nintellectual grandeur. His tragedies have an advantage over those of\r\nÆschylus, in being essentially human; they appeal to the feelings of an\r\nauditory, and are written in a less magniloquent style than that of the\r\nsublime father of Greek tragedy,--to whom, however, Sophocles lay under\r\nthe obligations of a pupil to his instructor. Both are profound masters\r\nof their art.\r\n\r\n  [This bust is from the Capitoline Museum, and is identified by another\r\n  in the Vatican--found in 1778--on which all the letters of the name\r\n  remained, except the SO. It was for a long time called PINDAR,*\r\n  because of the inscription; Bottari has proved it to be Sophocles,\r\n  whom it completely resembles. Compare the Lateran statue, No. 325,\r\n  standing in the great Transept, near the monument of Lysicrates.]\r\n\r\n*. PINDAR. _Greek Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born probably at Thebes, about B.C. 522. Died there, about B.C. 442.\r\n  Aged about 80 years.]\r\n\r\nThe most famous lyric poet of Greece. Sent at an early age to Athens, he\r\nbecame the pupil of Lasus. He sung the victors in the Olympic, Nemæan,\r\nPythian, and Isthmian games,--the great festivals of assembled Greece.\r\nForty-five of these odes of triumph are all that have descended to us;\r\nthey are characterized by great boldness of style, spirit, and\r\ntrumpet-toned enthusiasm, but the brilliant diction does not escape\r\nobscurity; and the modern student often follows with difficulty the\r\nexcursive wing of “The Theban Eagle,” through the wide regions of\r\nHellenic mythology. Pindar’s earliest extant work was written in his\r\ntwentieth year. He is described as a man of strong religious feelings,\r\nand a devout worshipper of the gods.\r\n\r\n8. ÆSCHINES. _Greek Orator._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Attica, about B.C. 389. Died in the Isle of Samos, B.C. 314.\r\n  Aged about 75.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest Greek orators. Was at the battle of Mantineia (B.C.\r\n362), and distinguished himself at the battle of Tamynæ in Eubœa (B.C.\r\n358). Afterwards entered into political life, and became a partizan of\r\nPhilip of Macedonia. Accompanied Demosthenes on two embassies to Philip,\r\nand was accused by Demosthenes of betraying the interests of the state\r\nto that monarch. The speech of his accuser and his own admirable defence\r\nare extant. His last great public act was the prosecution of Gtesiphon\r\nfor illegally proposing to present Demosthenes with a golden crown for\r\nhis services to the state. Demosthenes defended the accused, and the\r\nspeeches of the two orators delivered on this occasion are also\r\npreserved. The prosecution failing, Æschines at once went into exile\r\n(B.C. 330). As a popular leader and orator worthy to be called the rival\r\nof Demosthenes. He lacked the vehement passion and powerful invective of\r\nthat consummate master, but his lucid arrangement, his facility and\r\nperspicuity, have never been surpassed.\r\n\r\n  [For an account of this statue, so long called Aristides,* see\r\n  Handbook to Roman Court and Nave, No. 326.]\r\n\r\n*. ARISTIDES. _Athenian Patriot._\r\n\r\n  [Born (uncertain). Died about B.C. 468.]\r\n\r\nHis unbending integrity procured him the title of “The Just.” Was at the\r\nbattle of Marathon (B.C. 480), where he fought bravely. Opposed to the\r\nextreme democratical party in Athens, headed by Themistocles, by whose\r\ninfluence he was banished (about B.C. 483). He was still in exile at the\r\ntime of the sea-fight of Salamis (B.C. 482), but he raised a band, and\r\nfought for his country in this battle. Recalled by the Athenians from\r\nbanishment, and commanded their army at the battle of Platæa (B.C. 479).\r\nHis sense of justice spotless: his self-denial unimpeachable. At his\r\ndeath he was very poor, although he had borne the highest offices of the\r\nState. The Athenians became more virtuous from the contemplation of this\r\nbright example. It is related that in the representation of one of the\r\ntragedies of Æschylus, a sentence was uttered in favour of moral\r\ngoodness. The eyes of the audience turned involuntarily and at once from\r\nthe actor to Aristides.\r\n\r\n9. EURIPIDES. _Greek Poet._\r\n\r\n  Born at Salamis, B.C. 480. Died in Macedonia, B.C. 406. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nThe father of Euripides, putting his own interpretation upon the oracle\r\nwhich promised that his son should be crowned with “sacred garlands,”\r\nhad him carefully trained in gymnastic exercises, and whilst yet a boy\r\nEuripides won the prize at the Eleusinian and Thesean games. But the lad\r\nwas soon allured from physical sports, by the fascinations of philosophy\r\nand literature. He became the ardent pupil and friend of the philosopher\r\nAnaxagoras, and the instruction thus derived is visible in many of his\r\nproductions. At the age of 18, Euripides wrote his first tragedy. He\r\ngained the first prize B.C. 441, and continued to exhibit his plays\r\nuntil within two years of his death. He died in Macedonia, and is said\r\nto have been torn in pieces by the dogs of the Macedonian king. Twenty\r\nof his plays are extant. Like Anaxagoras, Euripides was of a serious\r\ntemper, and averse to mirth. He was intimate with Socrates, and the\r\ncontemporary of Herodotus, Xenophon, Thucydides, Pindar, Aristophanes,\r\nÆschylus, and Sophocles. To assign him his poetical rank we must look\r\nback. In the three great Attic tragedians we trace a natural progress of\r\ntheir theatre. In Æschylus, the stage appears attracted with predominant\r\nforce to the high mythological ideas which it arose to embody: the muse\r\nstalks sublimely above the heads of men. In Sophocles, the art tempers\r\nand adjusts, with admirable equipoise, the superhuman and the human\r\nelement; the spirits and hearts of men are more closely approached by\r\nthe poet, still overshadowed by the heroic and the divine. In Euripides,\r\nalthough the story which he represents is still drawn from the same\r\nsource of divine and heroic fable, the sympathy with passions, events,\r\ninterests, and sufferings, incident to humanity, prevails in excess.\r\nWith him, amidst strewings of beautiful poetry, and whilst penetrated\r\nwith strokes of singular pathos, we too much feel that we step on our\r\nown daily and common earth. We miss the elevation of an art which\r\nshould, in reflecting ourselves, lift us above ourselves: as we have\r\nexperience in our own Shakspeare. Sophocles said that “he himself\r\nrepresented men as they ought to be, but Euripides as they are.”\r\n\r\n  [This bust is verified by another in the Louvre, and one in the Naples\r\n  Museum, which has the name of Euripides engraved on the breast. There\r\n  is also a cameo of exceeding beauty in the Louvre, on which we find\r\n  the same head. Portraits of Euripides were common at Athens, and even\r\n  as late as the 5th century his statues were to be seen at\r\n  Constantinople. A small seated statue of Euripides will be found in\r\n  the Bas-relief Gallery, No. 215. It is inscribed with his name, and\r\n  has a list of his plays, upon the slab which supports the statue. See\r\n  Handbook to Greek Court, No. 215.]\r\n\r\n10. ARATUS. _Astronomer._\r\n\r\n  [Flourished about B.C. 270.]\r\n\r\nA fellow-countryman of St. Paul, who quotes one of his works in his\r\naddress to the Athenians. Called to the Court of Antigonus Gonatas, King\r\nof Macedonia. He there pursued physics, grammar, and philosophy. He also\r\nversified two astronomical treatises by Eudoxus. There are many errors\r\nwith much want of precision in the descriptive portions of these works,\r\nproving the poet to have been neither a mathematician nor an acute\r\nobserver. As a poet, Aratus was hardly more eminent. He is wanting in\r\noriginality and poetic feeling; yet his verses obtained popularity both\r\nin Greece and Rome.\r\n\r\n  [The well known head, representing, as it is supposed, the Poet of the\r\n  Stars, in the attitude of viewing the heavens. The same head is found\r\n  on medals, of which the best is preserved in the Hunterian Museum of\r\n  the College of Surgeons, London.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK COURT.--NORTH SIDE-COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK PHILOSOPHERS, STATESMEN, AND GENERALS.\r\n\r\n11. BIAS. _Greek Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Priene, in Ionia. Flourished, it is believed, about the\r\n  middle of the Sixth Century B.C.]\r\n\r\nOne of the Seven Sages; and of the four to whom alone the title was\r\nuniversally conceded: the remaining three being Thales, Pittacus, and\r\nSolon. His profession was that of an advocate; his philosophy was\r\npractical--the fruit of experience. Many of his sayings and doings have\r\nbeen recorded. He died at a very advanced age.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Vatican, which bears his name and the motto:--\r\n\r\n  ΟΙ ΠΛΕΙΣΤΟΙ\r\n  ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΙ\r\n  ΚΑΚΟΙ.\r\n\r\n  “The majority of men are bad.”\r\n\r\n  A curious mistake of the engraver is observable in the word ΠΡΗΝΕΥΣ,\r\n  in which the I is omitted; it should have been ΠΡΙΗΝΕΥΣ, the name of\r\n  his birth-place. This bust was found at Tivoli, with that of\r\n  Periander, No. 29.]\r\n\r\n12. THUCYDIDES. _Greek Historian._\r\n\r\n  Born at Athens, B.C. 471. Died (place uncertain) B.C. 395. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nThis great historian, holding military command in Thrace, suffered\r\nAmphipolis to be surprised and taken by the Spartan general, Brasidas;\r\nand for this misfortune was banished by his countrymen during the space\r\nof twenty years. It would have been a greater misfortune for the world\r\nhad Thucydides proved a warier soldier; for it was during his exile,\r\nthat he collected with infinite care the materials of his immortal\r\nhistory. That history chronicles, in eight books, the events of twenty\r\nout of the twenty-seven years of the Peloponnesian War:--a record of\r\nmost interesting facts. Where political and moral observations occur,\r\nthey reveal great knowledge of human character and motives. The style is\r\npregnant, precise, and severely simple. Demosthenes is said to have\r\ncopied the entire history many times with his own hand as a lesson of\r\ncomposition. The principal actors in the war were the historian’s books\r\nof reference. As an historical monument the work is matchless. It has\r\nbeen always believed that Thucydides came to a violent end, but it is\r\nnot known whether he died at Athens, or in Thrace.\r\n\r\n13. SOCRATES. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  Born near Athens, B.C. 468. Died at Athens, B.C. 399. Aged 69.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest names in ethics, philosophy, and religion before the\r\nChristian era. It was the belief of Socrates that he was specially\r\ncharged by the Deity to awaken moral consciousness in men. He had no\r\nschool, neither did he, like the sophists of his time, deliver public\r\nlectures. But he stood in the market-places, or entered the work-shops,\r\nor visited the schools, in order to teach the people his ideas\r\nrespecting the scope and value of human speculation and action.\r\nAristophanes, the comic poet, ridiculed and misrepresented the\r\nphilosopher, who proceeded, nevertheless, with undaunted perseverance.\r\nAfter the banishment from Athens of the “Thirty Tyrants,” Socrates was\r\nimpeached for corrupting the youth, and despising the tutelary deities\r\nof the state. He was condemned, and, preferring death to acknowledging,\r\nby a supplication for pardon, that he deserved punishment, he swallowed\r\npoison. Whilst the cruel draught was performing its work, he developed\r\nthe grounds of his immovable conviction of the immortality of the soul,\r\nand with his very last breath pointed to a future state, as the true\r\nrecovery from impurity and disease. He left no writings behind him. We\r\nderive our knowledge of his doctrines and character, mainly from his\r\nillustrious disciples, Xenophon and Plato. He effected a grand\r\nrevolution in philosophy, for he first connected with Supreme\r\nintelligence, the attributes of goodness, justice and wisdom, and the\r\nidea of direct interposition in human affairs, and recalled Reason from\r\nvain disquisitions, to the questions which come home to the business and\r\nbosoms of men. In person, Socrates was said to resemble the god Silenus.\r\nHis looks were as repulsive as his life was irreproachable and perfect.\r\nHis peculiar method of teaching, since called the Socratic, was, by a\r\nseries of artfully contrived questions, to draw out from the mind of his\r\ncolloquist the truths which lay unconsciously embosomed there, or to\r\nentangle proud and false reasoning in self-confutation.\r\n\r\n  [A countenance so little expressive of wisdom and goodness, that it\r\n  might be mistaken for that of a Silenus, whom he also equalled in the\r\n  almost deformed rotundity of his figure. But this bust, which is from\r\n  that in the Louvre, and an exceedingly fine work, has been proved to\r\n  be a portrait of him by its close resemblance to the other busts of\r\n  the same subject, and to that in particular in the Farnese Collection\r\n  which bears his name, and the motto which Plato gives him (_Criton_).\r\n  Busts and cameos of Socrates are numerous. No. 13A is from the Stanza\r\n  dei Filosofi of the Capitoline Museum; it is inferior to the first\r\n  described.]\r\n\r\n13A. SOCRATES. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n14. HIPPOCRATES. _Physician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cos, in the Ægean Sea, about B.C. 460. Died about 357. Aged\r\n  104.]\r\n\r\nThe great fame acquired by Hippocrates, would seem to have been won by a\r\nsteadfast adherence to the sagacity of common sense. He had no chemical\r\nknowledge, and his acquaintance with anatomy appears to have been scanty\r\nand uncertain; yet, knowing how to turn a rare experience to account,\r\nand confining his operations mainly to the watching and assisting of\r\nNature, he succeeded in obtaining credit for superhuman skill. His\r\nnephew, who is reputed to have possessed almost equal merit with his\r\nuncle, was murdered in a fit of jealousy, by Hippocrates, who shortly\r\nafterwards fell a sacrifice to the torments of remorse. A great number\r\nof works are extant under his name, but most of them were written by his\r\ndisciples.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, which has been verified by a medal\r\n  bearing the name of Hippocrates, and showing a perfect resemblance to\r\n  the head. There are several busts of Hippocrates in existence--one in\r\n  the Capitoline Museum, another at Florence, and two in the Louvre.]\r\n\r\n15. ISOCRATES. _Rhetorician._\r\n\r\n  Born at Athens, B.C. 436. Died B.C. 338. Aged 98.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Isocrates was the first man to describe the true value\r\nand objects of oratory. His language is the purest Attic; his style,\r\nwhich he elaborated with great pains, elegant and polished. As teacher\r\nof rhetoric, he became the instructor of the chief youths of his time.\r\nHe composed several discourses on great political occasions, and\r\namassed considerable wealth. He had throughout life a constitutional\r\ntimidity, and a weakness of voice that prevented him from speaking in\r\nthe assemblies of the people. Socrates had been one of his masters. His\r\ncharacter appears to have been spotless.\r\n\r\n  [From the bust in the Villa Albani at Rome, bearing the name of\r\n  Isocrates. A statue of him was sculptured by Leochares for the temple\r\n  of Eleusis, and another is described by Pausanias as in the temple of\r\n  Jupiter Olympius, which statue is spoken of by Christodorus, as being\r\n  at Constantinople in his time.]\r\n\r\n16. PLATO. _Greek Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Athens, B.C. 430. Died B.C. 347. Aged 83.]\r\n\r\nThe most illustrious amongst the disciples of Socrates. The doctrines of\r\nthe great teacher have descended to us chiefly through the writings of\r\nthis eloquent hearer. Whence, a singular and inextricable conflict. The\r\nsturdy, keen, practical plain sense of the master, and the soaring,\r\nbrilliant imagination, and subtly-dividing wit of the pupil, have come\r\ndown to us mingled ever in the same composition. In these extraordinary\r\ndialogues, which display the spoken Greek of Athens in its utmost\r\npurity, beauty, and melody, how much is Plato’s?--how much is of\r\nSocrates? The two busts may go as far as any other authorities, in\r\naffording the almost discretionary reply. The lip on which, whilst in\r\nthe cradle, tradition says that the bee settled--signifying the\r\nsweetness of the speech which should flow from it--is before us, in part\r\nof the answer. Plato was, in his earlier life, a poet, but gave his\r\npoetical compositions, amongst which are mentioned an epic poem and a\r\ntragedy, to the flames. He excelled in bodily exercises, being\r\ndistinguished as a wrestler. He travelled much in the quest of\r\nknowledge. Like his illustrious preceptor, he taught that wisdom, under\r\nwhich we must comprise goodness, is the attribute of the Godhead,--that\r\nphilosophy is an intellectual necessity, and, as the fountain of virtue,\r\nwhich it thus includes, the most estimable of all the goods within the\r\nreach of man. Abstruse and sublime, seeking to rest science and morals\r\non an immutable basis, Plato trains the intellect more than he teaches.\r\nIn reading his writings, we enter the Socratic school as hearers, as\r\ndisputants. The Socrates, who constantly leads the discussion, is rather\r\nthe presiding Spirit, than the Man. We come out, whatsoever else,\r\nworshipping students of the True, of the Fair, of the Good.\r\n\r\n  [From the very beautiful little bust in the Florence Gallery. He wears\r\n  the “strophium” as a mark of his great honours. This bust possesses a\r\n  great claim to authenticity, on account of the name being deeply cut\r\n  upon it in Greek letters of the antique form. There is a similar bust\r\n  in the Naples Museum, of the same size, and inscribed with the name of\r\n  Plato.]\r\n\r\n17. ANTISTHENES. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died at Athens. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nHe is the founder of the Cynic philosophy and flourished about B.C. 375.\r\nHe taught the love of poverty and labour, the renunciation of all the\r\npleasures and conveniences of life, and contempt for everything but\r\nvirtue, in which only he allowed true happiness to consist. It is said\r\nthat Antisthenes left more books than scholars. But Socrates was his\r\nfriend and Diogenes his pupil. His countenance did credit to his creed:\r\nit was severe, and looked the more terrible from his dishevelled hair\r\nand hanging beard. He taught in the Gymnasium at Athens, called\r\nCynosarges; and hence the name of his school--the Cynic.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Vatican. It was found in the ruins of\r\n  Hadrian’s Villa, and is of great beauty. It resembles another bust in\r\n  the Vatican, which was found in the villa of Cassius at Tivoli, but\r\n  which is of less merit, except that it bears his name. The portrait\r\n  agrees precisely with the descriptions given of Antisthenes by the\r\n  ancients.]\r\n\r\n18. DIOGENES. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Sinope, in Asia Minor, about B.C. 412. Died at Corinth, B.C.\r\n  323 or 324. Aged 90.]\r\n\r\nHaving been detected with his father, a banker, in some dishonest\r\ntransaction, Diogenes went to Athens, where he became the pupil of\r\nAntisthenes, and adopted the Cynic philosophy. He carried his contempt\r\nfor riches and the usages of society to an extravagant excess. He\r\nsubsisted on charity, and slept where he could. Some doubt is thrown\r\nupon the story of his living in a tub. He said that all the vicissitudes\r\nof fortune which constitute tragedy, had been realized in him, but that\r\npatience had raised him above them all. When advanced in years he was\r\ntaken by pirates to Crete, and there sold as a slave. Regaining his\r\nfreedom, he revisited Athens and Corinth, and in the last-named city had\r\nhis memorable interview with Alexander the Great. He inculcated\r\nmorality, but despised intellectual pursuits. His disposition was kind\r\nand humorous, though his statue has an acute and caustic countenance.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Sala delle Muse of the Vatican. It is verified\r\n  by its close resemblance to the head of a little statue in the Villa\r\n  Albani at Rome, representing the Cynic perfectly nude, and accompanied\r\n  by his dog. It is said that he sometimes appeared in the streets in\r\n  this state, after having anointed his body, a piece of eccentricity\r\n  that gave rise to the joke of Juvenal, that the Stoics differed from\r\n  the Cynics only in the shirt, “_tunicâ tantum_.” There is in the Villa\r\n  Albani an antique bas-relief representing Alexander the Great standing\r\n  before the Cynic in his tub.]\r\n\r\n19. DEMOSTHENES. _Greek Orator._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Athens, B.C. 381. Died in the isle of Calauria, opposite\r\n  Argolis, B.C. 322. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nA chief, if not the chief of--\r\n\r\n    “Those ancients, whose resistless eloquence\r\n     Wielded at will that fierce Democracie,\r\n     Shook th’ Arsenal, and fulmin’d over Greece,\r\n     To Macedon and Artaxerxes’ throne.”[29]\r\n\r\nThis eloquence in Demosthenes--to the modern mind, the one unrivalled\r\nexemplar of the ancient Greek oratory---was like a trained athlete,\r\nliving nerve and bone. When Athens lay daunted under the successes of\r\nPhilip of Macedon, Demosthenes, by the sole power of speech, roused the\r\npeople to energetic warfare. His style was fit for sustaining argument\r\non the destinies of great nations. It was simple, severe, lofty,\r\nvehement, and of irresistible power. He acquired this consummate\r\nmastery, having, by an invincible perseverance, vanquished seemingly\r\ninvincible natural obstacles. At one period of his life Demosthenes was\r\naccused of receiving a bribe from Harpalus, a Macedonian General, who\r\nfled to Athens, to escape the vengeance of Alexander. He quitted Athens.\r\nUpon the death of Alexander he returned to the city; but the Athenian\r\narms proving unsuccessful against Antipater, the ruler of Macedonia, the\r\nlife of the orator was demanded by the conqueror. Demosthenes fled\r\nagain--this time to the isle of Calauria--where he took poison to save\r\nhimself from the swords of the soldiery. Looking upon the deep,\r\ncontemplative, sad brow, figured in stone, we might well fancy that we\r\nsee, gleaming there, a too real consciousness of the requital awaiting\r\neven the greatest Athenian, for services which no reward could measure.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre. Several busts in various collections\r\n  had been called Terence, Pythagoras, Plato, and other names, when\r\n  there were dug up in Herculaneum two bronze heads, on one of which was\r\n  the name of Demosthenes; it was at once perceived that the busts above\r\n  referred to had been wrongly named; for they one and all represented\r\n  the great orator. A very beautiful carved medallion in amethyst exists\r\n  also at Rome, which is an undoubted likeness of him. For an account of\r\n  the statues of Demosthenes see Nos. 308 and 321 in the Handbook to the\r\n  Roman Court and Nave.]\r\n\r\n  [29] _Paradise Regained._\r\n\r\n20. EPICURUS. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born probably at Samos, in Greece, B.C. 342. Died at Athens, B.C.\r\n  270. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nThe system of Epicurus has been much misrepresented. He did not teach\r\nmere refined animal enjoyment. He considered indeed human happiness as\r\nthe end of philosophy, and he defined happiness as pleasure,--pleasure\r\nitself being defined as perfect independence, self-reliance, and\r\ncontentment. The great aim of his ethics was to point out the way to the\r\nattainment of such happiness. The habits of Epicurus were temperate and\r\nfrugal. During the later years of his life, he was afflicted with much\r\nphysical suffering, and he bore it with fortitude and patience. He held\r\nhis celebrated school, which founded the sect bearing his name, in a\r\ngarden purchased by him at Athens.\r\n\r\n20A. METRODORUS. _Greek Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born either at Lampsacus or Athens, B.C. 329. Died B.C. 277. Aged\r\n  52.]\r\n\r\nA devoted follower of Epicurus, between whom and his disciple the\r\nclosest friendship subsisted. Upon the death of Metrodorus, Epicurus\r\nprovided for his children. But Metrodorus failed to do justice to the\r\nphilosophy of his master; and was the first to attach to the Epicurean\r\nidea the sensual notions that have ever since, more or less, been\r\nidentified with it.\r\n\r\n  [The master and his intimate friend and disciple united. Busts of\r\n  Epicurus are common. Such was the enthusiasm of his followers, that\r\n  his portrait was multiplied in every way, and even the furniture of\r\n  rooms engraved with his name. This double terminal is from the\r\n  Capitoline Museum, at Rome, and bears the names of the two\r\n  philosophers. It was dug up at Rome in 1742, when the foundations were\r\n  making for Sta. Maria Maggiore. Epicurus is identified also by a\r\n  beautiful and perfect little bronze found at Herculaneum amongst the\r\n  remains of a library of a disciple of Epicurus; which bronze is now in\r\n  the Naples Museum.]\r\n\r\n21. ZENO. _Founder of the Stoic Philosophy._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Citium, in the Isle of Cyprus, about B.C. 362. Year of death\r\n  uncertain.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a merchant, and himself a trader. Whilst pursuing his\r\nvocation, he obtained some works on the Socratic philosophy; read them\r\nwith eagerness, and resolved to abandon trade for philosophy. Became a\r\ndisciple of the Cynics; then a pupil of Stilpo of Megara; then lent an\r\near to the expositors of Plato. After twenty years’ study and inquiry,\r\nhe turned aside from all existing schools, and created one for himself.\r\nThe place chosen by him for his instructions was a portico, adorned on\r\nthe wall with paintings by Polygnotus, hence called “The Variegated\r\nPorch” (_Stoa Poicilē_). Thus he and his pupils were called Stoics.\r\nThey placed happiness in virtue. Virtue is--to live, by the rule of\r\nright reason, a life consistent with itself and with universal nature:\r\nand lifts above _all_ consideration of pleasures and pains. The absolute\r\nmoral rectitude of volition and action is the steering star. But that\r\nsecured--the humanities, courtesies, and customs of life are not, after\r\nthe fashion of the Cynics, to be slighted and trampled upon. Zeno\r\ncommands our respect by the purity of his life. He lived to a great age,\r\nthough of weakly constitution, by dint of regularity and moderation. He\r\nhad a serious and thoughtful countenance, corresponding to the severity\r\nof the doctrines he taught. In his 98th year, quitting his school, he\r\nfell to the ground and broke his finger. “Why am I thus importuned?” he\r\nexclaimed. “Earth, I obey thy summons.” He went home, and strangled\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Sala delle Muse of the Vatican. It was\r\n  identified by the stooping attitude of the neck, a slight deformity\r\n  which is referred to by the contemporaries of Zeno. For an account of\r\n  the statue of this philosopher, see No. 327, Handbook to Roman Court\r\n  and Nave.]\r\n\r\n22. ALEXANDER THE THIRD, surnamed THE GREAT. _King of Macedonia_, B.C.\r\n336-323.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Pella, in Macedonia, B.C. 356. Died at Babylon, B.C. 323.\r\n  Aged 32.]\r\n\r\nThe pupil of Aristotle, and the conqueror of the world. He ascended the\r\nthrone of Macedon in the twentieth year of his age. Shortly afterwards\r\nhe reduced the chief cities of Greece, and rased Thebes sparing only the\r\nhouse of the poet Pindar. In his twenty-second year, he crossed the\r\nHellespont, and turned his arms against the Persian king, Darius, whom\r\nhe defeated. He conquered Phœnicia, Damascus, and Tyre. Taking Gaza, he\r\npassed into Egypt, subdued it, and founded the city of Alexandria. Here,\r\nin the madness of his ambition, he claimed divine honours. In 331, B.C.,\r\nhe again attacked Darius, and destroyed the Persian monarchy. Babylon,\r\nSusa, and Persepolis, next paid homage to his arms. A change now came\r\nover the victor, hitherto temperate and forgiving. He gave rein to his\r\npassions, and committed acts of cruelty and excess. But his activity was\r\nstill incessant. He advanced victoriously to the Indus, and marched back\r\nin triumphal procession to Babylon, where, still full of mighty plans of\r\nconquest, he fell a victim to intemperance, took fever and died in the\r\nthirteenth year of his reign. There was no mediocrity in the character\r\nof Alexander. His vices were great, and his virtues magnificent. His\r\nheart and mind led him to the extremes of good and evil. His lust of\r\ndominion amounted to insane passion. In accordance with his wish, his\r\nbody, enclosed in a golden coffin, was conveyed to Alexandria, and there\r\ndeposited in a richly adorned sarcophagus,--now supposed to be in the\r\nBritish Museum. The military skill of Alexander was of a high order. His\r\nmovements were rapid, decided, and well-directed:--he made great use of\r\nhis cavalry. His conquests rendered eastern Asia accessible to European\r\nenterprise. He retained his affection for his early instructor,\r\nAristotle, to the last, sending, from the scenes of his Eastern\r\nconquest, strange animals for the study of the great naturalist. In\r\nAsia, to this hour, the exploits of “Iskander,” are told by the people\r\nto their children.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, inscribed with his name. It was dug up\r\n  near Tivoli in 1779, and afterwards presented to Napoleon by the\r\n  discoverer, the Chevalier d’Azara. It was by this bust, aided by the\r\n  evidence of the coins, that all the portraits of Alexander were\r\n  verified. Notwithstanding the numerous statues, busts, and pictures\r\n  of this renowned conqueror which are mentioned by ancient writers,\r\n  only few now remain. One of the characteristics of the head is the\r\n  curling up of the hair at the back, as though a circlet had given the\r\n  hair that form, and it is said he was the first to wear a diadem. The\r\n  peculiar rising up of the hair in front is also a characteristic of\r\n  Alexander. A very beautiful little equestrian bronze was found at\r\n  Herculaneum in 1751, conjectured at the time to be a copy of the\r\n  statue of Alexander, by Lysippus. No. 22A, the inscription on which is\r\n  evidently modern, is from the Berlin Museum.]\r\n\r\n22A. ALEXANDER THE THIRD, surnamed THE GREAT.\r\n\r\n23. PHOCION. _Athenian Statesman and General._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Attica, B.C. 402. Died at Athens, B.C. 317. Aged 85.]\r\n\r\nHe rose from the ranks of the people, and soon obtained military\r\ndistinction; exhibiting, whenever tried, great bravery and foresight. He\r\nwas forty-five times named general. He was opposed to the Macedonians,\r\nover whom, by his moderation, valour, and prudence, he obtained signal\r\nadvantages. When, in his age, Athens--placed through the rejection of\r\nhis sagacious counsels at the mercy of the Macedonians--was occupied by\r\na foreign garrison, Phocion, whose integrity was invulnerable, was\r\nsuspected by his countrymen of treachery, and forced to swallow hemlock.\r\nHis body was denied burial, and cast beyond the confines of Attica; yet,\r\naccording to the spirit of those singular times, in which the wildest\r\nbarbarity co-existed with the purest heroism, and towering ingratitude\r\nseemed to be enacted only to make way for splendid remorse, his ashes\r\nwere subsequently brought back to Athens, his accusers put to death, and\r\na statue was raised to his honour. Phocion was surnamed “the Good.”\r\nAlexander, surnamed “the Great,” endeavouring to win him from his\r\nloyalty, offered him riches and the choice of four cities in Asia. The\r\nanswer of Phocion bespoke the spotless character of the man. “If\r\nAlexander really esteems me,” he said, “let him leave me my honesty.”\r\n\r\n  [From the statue, No. 324, for account of which see Handbook of Roman\r\n  Court and Nave.]\r\n\r\n24. ALCIBIADES. _Athenian General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Athens, B.C. 450. Died in Phrygia, B.C. 404. Aged 45.]\r\n\r\nThe nephew of Pericles, in whose house he was brought up. He was\r\nbeautiful in his youth, and he maintained his beauty throughout life,--a\r\npersonal advantage of which he was not a little conscious. He was the\r\npupil of Socrates, towards whom he entertained a sincere regard and\r\nfriendship to the last. He entered early into the service of the\r\nRepublic, and soon distinguished himself by his eloquence and feats of\r\narms. Accused of irreligion, he quitted Athens and took refuge in\r\nSparta, where he betrayed the designs of his country, and also abused\r\nthe hospitality of the Spartan king. Returning to Athens he gained\r\nseveral victories at the head of her armies, and recovered his position,\r\nbut only to lose it again in consequence of his ill-success in an\r\nexpedition against Andros. By order of the “Thirty Tyrants,” established\r\nby Lysander in Athens, he was at length assassinated. Alcibiades was\r\nremarkable for activity, eloquence, and address. He was very plausible,\r\nvery versatile, very unscrupulous, and a great dissembler. His unabashed\r\naudacity was matchless, but it was relieved, as well as heightened, by\r\ngood nature, and good humour. He was also selfish, and ambitious, and\r\ninordinately vain. He had a slight defect in his speech, and could not\r\npronounce the letter R.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Sala delle Muse of the Vatican. It has upon it\r\n  the first four letters of Alcibiades’ name. By an inferior artist, and\r\n  probably of a late date. It conveys no idea of the beauty of this\r\n  fiery-hearted soldier. No. 24A is a much finer head, but is not\r\n  entitled to the same confidence as a portrait. Alcibiades is said to\r\n  have been the model for Cupids and Mercuries in his youth. He received\r\n  all the honours of portraiture from the Athenians, who made several\r\n  statues of him in bronze, and the Romans placed his statue in the\r\n  Forum by the side of one of Pythagoras.]\r\n\r\n24A. ALCIBIADES. _Athenian General._\r\n\r\n25. MILTIADES. _Athenian General._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died B.C. 489.]\r\n\r\nAn Athenian. Succeeded his father Cimon as “Tyrant” of the Thracian\r\nChersonesus. He accompanied Darius on his expedition into Scythia. He\r\nwas subsequently driven out of the Chersonesus by the Persians, and fled\r\nto Athens, where he resumed his rights as an Athenian citizen. He was\r\none of the ten generals chosen by the Athenians to resist the Persian\r\ninvasion, but by the consent of his colleagues he was invested with sole\r\ncommand. He defeated the Persians under Datis and Artaphernes, at\r\nMarathon (B. C. 490), and saved Greece. The victory, as well for the\r\nimport of its consequences as for the disproportion between the numbers\r\nengaged, is one of the most memorable recorded in history. Afterwards\r\nintrusted with the command of a fleet, with which he attacked the Island\r\nof Paros, to gratify a private enmity. This expedition proving\r\nunsuccessful, Miltiades was impeached, condemned to a fine, and thrown\r\ninto prison, where he died of his wounds.\r\n\r\n  [The hero of Marathon received all portrait honours from the\r\n  Athenians. Pliny relates that Panænus, the brother of Phidias, painted\r\n  a picture of the battle with portraits of the generals; and the great\r\n  sculptor himself made a statue of the conqueror, the cost of which was\r\n  appropriately paid out of the spoils of the Persians. It was placed in\r\n  the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The bust, No. 25A, is in the Louvre;\r\n  it was found on the Celian Hill at Rome. The back part of the helmet\r\n  has sculptured upon it the furious bull of Marathon which Theseus\r\n  killed, and which Miltiades wears as a trophy of valour. This portrait\r\n  has been identified by a bust engraved with the name, described by\r\n  Fulvius Ursinus, but which is unfortunately lost.]\r\n\r\n25A. MILTIADES. _Athenian General._\r\n\r\n26. ASPASIA.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Miletus, in Asia Minor. Date of birth and death unknown; but\r\n  in the fifth century B.C.]\r\n\r\nA woman of great beauty and intellectual power, and the contemporary of\r\nPericles, who was her lover, and over whom she gained unbounded sway.\r\nHer house was the resort of the greatest and most learned men in Athens,\r\nand Socrates, Plato, and Alcibiades were her frequent guests. She is the\r\nfirst of her sex whose portrait has been handed down from hoary\r\nantiquity unto the present time. It is related that Pericles learnt\r\npolitical wisdom from her instruction, and took eloquence from her lips.\r\nPericles rewarded his instructress by saving her life through his\r\neloquence and tears, when, like Socrates, Aspasia was arraigned on the\r\ncharge of impiety. After the death of Pericles, Aspasia attached herself\r\nto an obscure man of the name of Lysicles, whom she advanced by her\r\ninstructions to high office in the Athenian republic.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Vatican, which is inscribed with her name.\r\n  This form of bust is rare for women; but it is thought to have been\r\n  chosen purposely, to show the superiority of one who gave counsel to\r\n  Pericles and taught, they say, Socrates eloquence. Her great celebrity\r\n  is guaranteed by this monument, which is the earliest antique Greek\r\n  portrait of a lady.]\r\n\r\n27. PERICLES. _Athenian Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Athens, B.C. 494. Died B.C. 429. Aged 65.]\r\n\r\nFor forty years at the head of the administration in Athens; twenty-five\r\nyears in conjunction with others, and fifteen years alone. He was the\r\npupil of Anaxagoras, from whom he derived philosophic equanimity and\r\nlofty principle. The eloquence of Pericles was a grand characteristic of\r\nthe man, but not the grandest. When dying, he affirmed that his greatest\r\nhonour had been, “that no Athenian, through his means, had ever put on\r\nmourning.” He promised the Athenians immortality; he secured it by means\r\nof the memorials of beauty which he left on the Athenian soil, now\r\nupwards of two thousand years ago. His oratory was rapid, penetrating,\r\ncondensed, energetic, persuasive, graceful, and fertile in resources.\r\nHis boundless influence was never degraded to unworthy purposes.\r\nArchitecture, sculpture, and literature, reached their highest point\r\nunder his protecting hand. Phidias was his director of public works;\r\nSophocles and Euripides were his favoured friends. He governed with\r\nmoderation and justice, and eschewing all aggression for the mere sake\r\nof conquest, endeavoured by every means to consolidate the dominion and\r\nto confirm the maritime power of Athens. His eloquence was the golden\r\nsceptre of his rule. He died in the great plague of Athens.\r\n\r\n  [Pliny mentions a painted portrait of him by Aristolaus, and\r\n  Christodorus states that his statue in bronze existed at\r\n  Constantinople. Phidias, it is said, sculptured the portrait of his\r\n  illustrious patron on the shield of the great Minerva, and the busts\r\n  of him are taken from this figure. This bust is from the British\r\n  Museum. There is also a bust of Pericles in the Vatican, which has the\r\n  name on the breast. He wears the Corinthian helmet.]\r\n\r\n28. PISISTRATUS. _“Tyrant” of Athens._[30]\r\n\r\n  [Born about B.C. 612. Died at Athens, B.C. 527.]\r\n\r\nA prince who made his way to power by questionable means, but who made\r\nof power a noble and an exemplary use. When Solon established his\r\nconstitution, and quitted Athens, Pisistratus headed one of the rival\r\nfactions that instantly rose up. He seized the citadel of Athens (B.C.\r\n560), but was subsequently driven from the city by the united efforts of\r\nhis foes. After six years’ absence he regained Athens by a stratagem,\r\nbut, again expelled, suffered another exile for the space of ten years.\r\nHe returned for a second time, and vanquished those who opposed him,\r\nassumed power, and maintained his position until his death. His rule was\r\nmoderate, just, and productive of great benefit to the Athenian people.\r\nHe encouraged literature and the drama, protected religion, and regarded\r\nthe interests of the poor. To him we owe the first written text of the\r\nwhole of the poems of Homer. He is also said to have been the first in\r\nGreece to collect a library for public use. He gave Athens repose,\r\nduring which she nourished the elements of her future strength and\r\npower.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble, which has hitherto been called a Pericles, in the\r\n  Rospigliosi Palace at Rome.]\r\n\r\n  [30] The title “Tyrant” in the old republics, meant only “absolute\r\n  monarch.”\r\n\r\n29. PERIANDER. _“Tyrant” of Corinth._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Corinth, about B.C. 670. Died about B.C. 585.]\r\n\r\nOne of the “Seven Wise Men of Greece,” and the son of Cypselus, “Tyrant”\r\nof Corinth, whom he succeeded B.C. 625. The first years of his\r\ngovernment were distinguished by moderation and wisdom, but afterwards\r\nhe exercised great cruelty towards his family and people. He reigned\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Vatican, which is remarkably well preserved.\r\n  It bears his name in Greek letters. It was found in 1780, near Tivoli,\r\n  in the house of Cassius, with the heads of Bias, Solon, Thales,\r\n  Pittacus, and Cleobulus, and probably formed part of the Gallery of\r\n  Cassius, the letters being of the Roman time. In the British Museum\r\n  there is another original marble of this philosopher, which formerly\r\n  was in the Palace of Sixtus V. at Rome.]\r\n\r\n30. LYCURGUS. _Lawgiver._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth and death unknown.]\r\n\r\nLycurgus holds an ambiguous place between tradition and history. Nothing\r\nauthentic is known of him, and a touch of the fabulous pervades his\r\nstory. He is said to have been of the line of Spartan kings, and, after\r\nhaving travelled in nearly all countries of the world, to have brought\r\nback his laws to Sparta, whose constitution he remodelled. Quitting\r\nSparta, he exacted a promise from the Spartans that they would not alter\r\nhis laws until his return. He never returned. He was honoured with a\r\ntemple and a yearly sacrifice. He inculcated, according to the\r\ntradition, rigid discipline, unquestioning obedience, and military\r\nardour.\r\n\r\n  [From the head of the statue in the Sala delle Muse of the Vatican,\r\n  Rome. It is another example of conventional or traditional\r\n  portraiture, but possesses one very remarkable confirmation of an\r\n  accident related in his life. In one of the disturbances of the\r\n  populace, he was struck in the eye; and it will be observed that one\r\n  eye of the bust has the peculiar appearance of being useless.\r\n  Visconti, who noticed this peculiarity, first named the statue\r\n  Lycurgus. There is a head in the Naples Museum which corresponds with\r\n  this, and both are confirmed by the medals which bear his name. The\r\n  drill holes about the beard are interesting, as they prove that the\r\n  ancient sculptors worked on the same plan as the moderns.]\r\n\r\n31. POSIDIPPUS. _Comic Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cassandreia, in Macedonia. Date of birth and death unknown.]\r\n\r\nNothing is known of his life or death. He was an Athenian comic poet, of\r\n“The New Comedy,” and his first dramas appeared B.C. 289. He was the\r\nlast, in order of time, of the six who are mentioned by the anonymous\r\nwriter on comedy, as the most celebrated poets of the New Comedy. He is\r\nsaid to have written forty plays, of which little more than the titles\r\nof eighteen are preserved. No accurate judgment can be formed of his\r\nstyle; some of his subjects, judging from the titles, must have been\r\nlicentious.\r\n\r\n  [For account of this statue, see Handbook to Roman Court and Nave, No.\r\n  291.]\r\n\r\n32. MENANDER. _Comic Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cephissia, near Athens, B.C. 342. Died probably at Athens,\r\n  B.C. 290. Aged 52.]\r\n\r\nThe model writer of “The New Comedy,” which substituted for the\r\npersonalities of the “Ancient Comedy,” a more faithful portraiture of\r\nthe vices and follies of men. A few fragments only remain of his\r\nnumerous works. His plays are said to have presented a most true and\r\nlively reflexion of the manners and morals of his age. He had many\r\nimitators amongst the Greeks and Romans, and Plautus and Terence\r\nprofited by his writings. Only eight of his plays were crowned. He was\r\nprobably in advance of his time and audience.\r\n\r\n  [For account of this statue, see Handbook to Greek Court, No. 290.]\r\n\r\n33. POSIDONIUS. _Greek Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Apameia in Syria, about 135 years B.C. Died, probably at\r\n  Rome, about 51 B.C.]\r\n\r\nA writer on History, Astronomy, Astrology, Cosmography, and Grammar, but\r\nnone of his works remain; a great scholar and traveller. A Stoic in\r\nphilosophy, yet desirous of bringing all systems of philosophy into\r\nharmony. He suffered much from illness. Pompey visited him during a\r\nsharp attack of gout, but during his agony he sustained an argument with\r\nthe orator Hermagoras to prove that pain is no evil. “Torment me if you\r\nwill, oh Pain!” he exclaimed, “I shall not admit pain to be an evil, a\r\nbit the more for that.”\r\n\r\n  [For account of this statue, see Handbook to Roman Court and Nave, No.\r\n  307.]\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN COURT.\r\n\r\nENTERING BY THE CENTRE ARCH FROM THE NAVE.\r\n\r\n(_Numbers commencing on the right._)\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN EMPERORS.\r\n\r\n34. NUMA POMPILIUS. _Second King of Rome._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cures, in the country of the Sabines.]\r\n\r\nThe life of Numa Pompilius belongs to the realm of fable. “His name,”\r\nsays Dr. Smith, “represents the rule of law and order, and to him are\r\nascribed all those ecclesiastical institutions which formed the basis of\r\nthe ceremonial religion of the Romans.” The legend attached to Numa\r\ndescribes him as the mildest, wisest, and most virtuous of men. After\r\nhis election to the throne, vacated by Romulus, his first care was to\r\nameliorate the condition of his people, and to legislate on behalf of\r\nreligion. He reigned thirty-nine years in uninterrupted peace. It is\r\nsuggested that as Numa was reputed chosen from amongst the Sabines, the\r\nRomans, in all probability, drew their religious institutions from that\r\nnation, rather than from the Etruscans.\r\n\r\n  [From the bust in the Vatican at Rome.]\r\n\r\n35. AUGUSTUS. _Roman Emperor_, B.C. 30-A.D. 14.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, B.C. 63. Died at Nola, in Campania, A.D. 14. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nThe first Roman Emperor. Trained for his public career by his\r\ngreat-uncle, Julius Cæsar. After the death of Cæsar (B.C. 44), he formed\r\nwith Antony and Lepidus the league known as the triumvirate. But\r\nsubsequently quarrelling with Antony, and overcoming him, he annexed\r\nEgypt to Rome, and became sole master of the State. His reign was\r\ntranquil, and he conciliated the people. His disposition appears to\r\nhave been cold; he lived simply, and despised pomp and pageantry.\r\n\r\n  [Suetonius mentions the handsome features of Augustus as well\r\n  preserved in his old age. He is described with eyebrows meeting and\r\n  thick, the ears small and well formed, the nose finely chiselled.\r\n  There are several busts of him taken at different periods. This Bust\r\n  is from the Statue Gallery of the Vatican. It represents him in old\r\n  age wearing a fillet and a medal bearing the effigy of his wife Livia.\r\n  No. 35A is a portrait at a younger period: it is from the Museo\r\n  Chiaramonti of the Vatican. There is a noble statue of him in the\r\n  “toga” in the Bas-relief gallery, see No. 80, Handbook of Greek\r\n  Court.]\r\n\r\n35A. AUGUSTUS. _Roman Emperor._\r\n\r\n36. NERO--CLAUDIUS CÆSAR DRUSUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 54-68.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Antium, in Latium, A.D. 37. Died near Rome, 68. Aged 31.]\r\n\r\nWhen we desire to express in a word the height of sanguinary cruelty and\r\natrocious tyranny, the name of Nero at once occurs to us. He was the son\r\nof Domitius Ahenobarbus, and of the infamous Agrippina, through whose\r\nintrigues he was adopted by Claudius, to the exclusion of his own son,\r\nas successor to the throne. Nero’s government, at first moderate and\r\nprudent, soon degenerated into fearful licentiousness. He poisoned\r\nBritannicus, the son of Claudius; he assassinated his mother; he\r\ndivorced and murdered his wife Octavia, the daughter of Claudius, in\r\norder to marry the beautiful and depraved Poppæa; he set fire to Rome,\r\nand put many Christians to death, on the pretence that they had caused\r\nthe conflagration; he killed Poppæa by a brutal kick, and he ordered\r\nexecutions and perpetrated wrongs of all kinds, and without number. The\r\nRoman world was at length tired of this monster; an insurrection broke\r\nout in Gaul; and Galba, the governor of Spain, was proclaimed Emperor.\r\nRome followed the example of the provinces, and rose in insurrection.\r\nNero took to flight, and gave himself a mortal wound, when he heard the\r\ntrampling of the horses on which his pursuers were mounted. It is said\r\nthat in his youth he was instructed in many branches of knowledge--that\r\nhe wrote poetry, and had some skill in music. His criminal career may\r\npossibly have been the result of furious insanity--we think, at least of\r\na lunatic, when we read that Nero appeared on the Roman stage as an\r\nactor, and played the fiddle whilst the city was burning.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre. The circlet round his head was worn by\r\n  him to imitate the rays of the sun; the holes for the rays are\r\n  observable.

TIBERIUS--CLAUDIUS NERO CÆSAR. _Roman Emperor_, A.D.\r\n14-37.\r\n\r\n  [Born, B.C. 42. Died at Misenum, A.D. 37. Aged 79.]\r\n\r\nSon of Titus Claudius Nero, and of Livia, whose second husband was\r\nAugustus. The successor of his stepfather and the husband of Julia the\r\ndaughter of Augustus. During his earlier years of rule he governed with\r\nmoderation and justice; but, growing suspicious of those around him, he\r\npatronized a detestable class of men who acquired infamy in the state\r\nunder the title of “Delatores,” or “Informers,” and by establishing in\r\nits utmost extent the law of _læsa majestas_ (high treason) obtained\r\nopportunity to the shedding of some base, and of much honourable blood.\r\nHe also became a religious persecutor, unfilial, hateful of the rising\r\nglory of other men, and sensual. He quitted Rome, A.D. 26, and never\r\nreturned to the city. He took up his residence in the delicious island\r\nof Capreæ, lying off the Campanian coast. Mean, timid, irresolute,\r\ninsincere: yet wise in his generation, with some penetration and\r\npolitical skill. He wrote a brief commentary of his life. His youthful\r\nname has been immortalized by Horace. In the reign of Tiberius and in\r\nthe year 33, Jesus Christ suffered crucifixion in Judea, under the\r\ncondemnation of Pontius Pilate.\r\n\r\n38 (_outside_). CLAUDIUS I.--TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS DRUSUS NERO GERMANICUS.\r\n_Roman Emperor_, A.D. 41-54.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Lyons, in Gaul, B.C. 10. Died A.D. 54. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nFourth in the series of Roman Emperors. Called to the throne in his\r\nfiftieth year, upon the murder of his nephew Caligula. Branded as a\r\ntyrant, but ought rather to be pitied for his weakness, timidity,\r\nvacillation, and utter helplessness. He was the sport of the wicked, and\r\nthe victim of his own wretched feebleness. Unfortunate in every relation\r\nof life. His third wife was the notorious Valeria Messalina; his fourth,\r\nhis own niece, the shameless Agrippina, who prevailed upon the\r\nhalf-witted Emperor to disinherit his offspring in favour of her son\r\nNero, and who afterwards caused the unhappy Claudius to be poisoned. The\r\nrule of this Emperor, when left to himself, is described as mild and\r\npopular; but he had seldom the advantage of independent action, and in\r\nthe hands of others he was robbed of moral will. Fond of building,\r\nClaudius raised the Claudian aqueduct. He wrote Greek as well as Latin,\r\nand composed some works on history, besides memoirs of his own life.\r\n\r\n39. GALBA--SERVIUS SULPICIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 68-69.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Terracina, in Italy, B.C. 3. Died at Rome, A.D. 69. Aged 73.]\r\n\r\nThe successor of Nero; and governor of Spain when he was raised to the\r\nsupreme dignity. A strict military disciplinarian, and remarkable for\r\ncare and prudence. But when Emperor, his prudence became avarice, and he\r\npractised sordid measures, under the plea of imitating the frugality of\r\nthe ancients. His niggardliness gave offence to the military and to the\r\ncitizens, who had been used to festivals under Nero; and in his old age,\r\nGalba was cut down in the streets of Rome. He reigned 7 months.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n39*. VESPASIAN--TITUS FLAVIUS SABINUS VESPASIANUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D.\r\n69-70.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Nursia, in the country of the Sabines, A.D. 9. Died at\r\n  Cutiliæ, in the country of the Sabines, A.D. 79. Aged 69.]\r\n\r\nOf low origin. Went to Britain and subdued the Isle of Wight. Afterwards\r\nsent to the East by Nero against the Jews, and was proclaimed Emperor by\r\nhis troops at Alexandria. On the death of Vitellius proceeded to Rome,\r\nwhere, as Emperor, he restored order, reformed abuses, and improved the\r\ncondition of the empire. He commenced the Coliseum. A great Emperor,\r\npopular with his army, upright, conscientious, simple in his living, and\r\naffable in his manners.\r\n\r\n  [For account of the colossal Bust of Vespasian, see Handbook to Roman\r\n  Court and Nave, No. 338.]\r\n\r\n40. CALIGULA. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 37-41.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Antium, in Latium, A.D. 12. Died at Rome, A.D. 41. Aged 29.]\r\n\r\nSon of Germanicus and Agrippina. His real name was Caius Cæsar, but\r\ncalled Caligula by the soldiers, from his wearing in his boyhood small\r\ncaligæ or soldier’s boots. Passed his boyhood in his father’s camp in\r\nGermany. On the death of Tiberius he became Emperor, and for a time\r\nruled wisely. On recovering, however, from a severe illness, he\r\nperpetrated acts of horror characteristic of a madman. He murdered the\r\ninnocent for his amusement, and married and dissolved his marriages in\r\nthe most shameless manner. His favourite horse he raised to the\r\nConsulship, and he deified himself. After passing three years in raving\r\ncrime and folly, he was struck down by the conspirator’s sword.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Gallery of the Emperors, of the Capitoline\r\n  Museum. Busts of Caligula are very rare, because, like those of\r\n  Commodus, they were as far as possible destroyed, on account of his\r\n  atrocities. He is said to have had a complexion of repulsive paleness.\r\n  Suetonius alludes to his thin lips and expression of confirmed\r\n  dissimulation.]\r\n\r\n41. VITELLIUS--AULUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 69.\r\n\r\n  [Born on the Island of Capreæ, A.D. 15. Died at Rome, A.D. 69. Aged\r\n  54.]\r\n\r\nA royal glutton. He commanded in Lower Germany, where his popularity\r\nwith the troops led to his being proclaimed Emperor by the soldiers at\r\nCologne. Vitellius succeeded Otho, and reigned eight months after the\r\ndeath of the latter, when he was murdered. Avaricious of money for the\r\nsake of what it would purchase for the stomach. The life of Vitellius is\r\ntold when we state that it was devoted to eating, drinking, and acts of\r\ncruelty. It was his boast that the infamous Nero was his chosen model.\r\n\r\n  [From the Louvre. Full of the character of the man--bloated and\r\n  debased. He is said to have spent nine millions of sesterces in\r\n  suppers.]\r\n\r\n42. NERVA--MARCUS COCCEIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 96-98.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Narnia, in Umbria, A.D. 32. Died at Rome, A.D. 98. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nPliny says that the commencement of the reign of Nerva was the era of\r\nreturning freedom; and Tacitus praises the same Emperor, for reconciling\r\nsupreme authority with the liberty of the citizen. He succeeded the\r\nEmperor Domitian, who was murdered, and his first care was to restore\r\ntranquillity, and to repair the effects of his predecessor’s tyranny. He\r\nput an end to the persecution of the Christians, attended to the wants\r\nof the poor, and exercised a rigid economy. Gentleness and goodness were\r\nmarked features in his character.\r\n\r\n  [From the gallery of the Emperors in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n43. TITUS--FLAVIUS SABINUS VESPASIANUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 79-81.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, A.D. 40. Died at Cutiliæ, in the country of the\r\n  Sabines, A.D. 81. Aged 41.]\r\n\r\nElder son of the Emperor Vespasian, and one of the best of the Roman\r\nemperors. It was he who besieged and destroyed Jerusalem (A.D. 70); he\r\nalso completed the Coliseum at Rome, and during his reign Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum were buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius (A.D. 79). As\r\na soldier and general, his conduct marked by great humanity and bravery.\r\nAs Emperor, administered the laws justly and improved the condition of\r\nhis people by whom he was beloved. “The being beloved,” to use the\r\nwords of Voltaire, constituted his greatest glory. Possessed great\r\nintellectual refinement and delicacy of feeling. It is said that he was\r\npoisoned by his brother Domitian, who was impatient to succeed to the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome. Busts of Titus are\r\n  not common: yet his statues were in every house, on account of his\r\n  popularity. For an engraving of one, see Handbook of Roman Court and\r\n  Nave.]\r\n\r\n44. DOMITIAN--TITUS FLAVIUS SABINUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 81-96.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, A.D. 51. Died there, A.D. 96. Aged 45.]\r\n\r\nSon of the Emperor Vespasian, and brother of Titus. He was bloody and\r\ncowardly throughout his career. Suetonius says his very virtues were\r\nturned into vices. Before the death of his brother Titus he made many\r\nattempts upon his life, and, during his own reign, he frequently\r\ncompelled individuals to undergo the terrors of death, sparing their\r\nlives, in order to enjoy the sight of their sufferings. His government\r\nwas disastrous for Rome, though he boasted annually of great victories,\r\nand assumed the title of God. Pliny used to say that the triumphs of\r\nDomitian were certain “proofs that the enemy had gained an advantage.”\r\nNeither talent nor virtue was safe from his persecutions, yet, although\r\nthe last three years of his life form one of the most frightful epochs\r\nin history, Domitian had talent and a cultivated mind. He promoted\r\narchitecture and beautified Rome; he rebuilt the libraries which had\r\nbeen burnt in the preceding reign, and sent literary men to the famous\r\nAlexandrine library to make copies of books there. He was the victim of\r\na conspiracy, and the last of the twelve Cæsars.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n45. TRAJAN--M. ULPIUS TRAJANUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 98-117.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Italica, in Spain, A.D. 52. Died at Selinus, in Cilicia, 117.\r\n  Aged 65.]\r\n\r\nTrajan endeavoured to emulate the glory of Alexander by extending the\r\nRoman Empire in the East, but with imperfect success. He improved the\r\nsocial and physical condition of his subjects, was easy of access,\r\npossessed good sense, a profound judgment and knowledge of the world.\r\nNot a man of letters himself, he was the friend of Pliny the younger,\r\nTacitus, Plutarch, and Epictetus. He was tall, majestic, robust, and his\r\nhair perfectly white.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum. Busts of Trajan are not\r\n  uncommon. The seated statue of Trajan is described under No. 343, in\r\n  Handbook to Roman Court and Nave.]\r\n\r\n46. HADRIAN--PUBLIUS ÆLIUS HADRIANUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 117-138.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, A.D. 76. Died there, A.D. 138. Aged 63.]\r\n\r\nIn his youth wedded to literature, especially that of Greece. He was the\r\nadopted son of Trajan, whom he succeeded as Emperor, in A.D. 117.\r\nTravelling was with him a passion. In A.D. 119, he set forth on a\r\njourney which lasted for the space of 17 years. He visited Gaul, Britain\r\n(where he erected the famous wall between the Solway and the Tyne),\r\nSpain, Africa, and part of Asia. On a second visit to the East he lost\r\nhis favourite page Antinous, and his grief for this youth has since\r\nresounded through the world. Shortly after his return to Rome in 132,\r\nthe Jewish war broke out. It ended in the subjugation and slavery of the\r\nchosen people. He was a wise Emperor, a cultivator of the arts, and a\r\nlover of peace, though stained with vices of his age.\r\n\r\n  [Busts of Hadrian are common. This is from the Rotunda of the Vatican.\r\n  No. 123 is from a very perfect one in the Naples Museum. For engraving\r\n  of the fine statue in the British Museum, see Handbook of Roman Court\r\n  and Nave, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n47. ANTONINUS PIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 138-161.\r\n\r\n  [Born near Lanuvium, A.D. 86. Died at Lorium, A.D. 161. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nThe successor of Hadrian, and one of the most distinguished of the Roman\r\nEmperors. Improved the condition of his people, and consolidated the\r\npower of the empire by enlightened and conciliatory measures. He was\r\nrespected and beloved. Of commanding aspect and dignified demeanour. A\r\ndeep-toned melodious voice heightened his native eloquence. One of the\r\nmost virtuous princes that ever sat upon a throne.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Berlin Museum. There is in the Louvre a bust\r\n  of Antoninus Pius, having the head covered with a fold of the toga,\r\n  and crowned with ears of wheat, a copy of which is described under No.\r\n  381, Handbook of Roman Court and Nave.]\r\n\r\n48. MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 161-180.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, A.D. 121. Died at Sirmium, in Pannonia, A.D. 180. Aged\r\n  59.]\r\n\r\nSurnamed “The Philosopher.” One of the best and greatest princes of\r\nantiquity. He succeeded his adoptive father Antoninus Pius in A.D. 161,\r\nand from that time until his death, his public and private acts conduced\r\nto the welfare of his people and to the true glory of the empire. His\r\nsole misfortune was to be father of the brutal Commodus, who succeeded\r\nhim on the Imperial throne. He was clement, charitable, generous, and\r\nforgiving. His bodily health, always weakly, gave way beneath excessive\r\nlabour of mind and body, and his death created universal sorrow. After\r\nthe lapse of a hundred years his memory was still held in veneration by\r\nthe people. He was of a thoughtful nature. At an early period he admired\r\nthe precepts and adopted the costume of the Stoic philosophers. Later in\r\nlife he was wont to repeat with great satisfaction the saying of\r\nPlato--“How happy would the people be, if philosophers were kings, and\r\nkings philosophers.” His “Meditations”--a work in the Greek language--is\r\none of the noblest productions of Pagan philosophy.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Berlin Museum. No. 48A is called the young M.\r\n  Aurelius. The colossal head from the Louvre is described under No.\r\n  344, Handbook to Roman Court and Nave. The Senate decreed that a bust\r\n  of M. Aurelius should be in every house.]\r\n\r\n48A. MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS. _Roman Emperor._\r\n\r\n49. PERTINAX--PUBLIUS HELVIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 193.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Villa Martis, in Liguria, A.D. 126. Assassinated at Rome,\r\n  A.D. 193. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a charcoal-burner. First a schoolmaster in Liguria, then a\r\nsoldier. Rising to important command, he served in Great Britain and\r\nAfrica. Upon the murder of Commodus, the Prætorians prevailed upon him\r\nto assume the purple. He accepted the honour in difficult times, when\r\nvirtue met with as little mercy as vice. He stipulated that the dignity\r\nshould not extend beyond himself, to his wife or son; he proclaimed that\r\nno man should be prosecuted for treason; he at once set about useful\r\nreforms in the state; but in less than three months after his\r\naccession, he was murdered by the same Prætorians, simply because he was\r\ntoo upright and too good a man. He had a venerable aspect, and was mild\r\nand winning in his address.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Rotunda of the Vatican.]\r\n\r\n50. VERUS---LUCIUS AURELIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 161-169.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, A.D. 130. Died at Altinum, in the country of the\r\n  Veneti, A.D. 169. Aged 39.]\r\n\r\nLicentious and dissolute; the colleague of Marcus Aurelius in the\r\nempire, and the husband of Lucilla, daughter of the latter. During a\r\nfour years’ war against the Parthians, Lucius held command of the Roman\r\narmy: but, a drunkard and a gamester, his sole part in the war was to\r\nreap the glory of the victories won by his generals. In his youth, he is\r\ndescribed as well made in person; frank, simple, and gentle of\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\n  [A colossal Bust of him will be found described under Nos. 331 and\r\n  333, in the Handbook to the Roman Court and Nave. It was found in the\r\n  same place as the colossal Marcus Aurelius.]\r\n\r\n51. ÆLIUS VERUS. _Adopted Emperor._\r\n\r\n  [Born (uncertain). Died at Rome, A.D. 138.]\r\n\r\nOf a noble Etrurian family. His beauty and literary accomplishments drew\r\nthe favour of the Emperor Hadrian, who changing his name, adopted him\r\nfor his successor. Twice Consul. Governor, for a short time, of\r\nPannonia. Died suddenly. Of a luxurious character.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the gallery of the Emperors of the Capitoline\r\n  Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n52. ANNIUS VERUS. _Roman Prince._\r\n\r\n  [Born A.D. 162. Died at Præneste A.D. 170. Aged 7.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina, and the brother of Commodus,\r\nwith whom he was raised to the rank of Cæsar, A.D. 166.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre. Taken when young. A graceful little\r\n  Bust, remarkable for having the pupil of the eye so firmly indicated.]\r\n\r\n53. MARCUS GALERIUS ANTONINUS. _Roman Prince._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Flourished A.D. 140.]\r\n\r\nSon of Antoninus Pius and Annia Galeria Faustina. Nothing is known of\r\nhis life or death. His effigy is extant with that of his mother upon a\r\nrare Greek coin; but he is not styled Cæsar in the inscription. Marcus\r\nGalerius, no doubt, died before his father became Emperor.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Gallery of the Emperors of the Capitoline\r\n  Museum.]\r\n\r\n54. SEVERUS--LUCIUS SEPTIMIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 193-211.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Leptis, in Africa, A.D. 146. Died at Eboracum (York), A.D.\r\n  211. Aged 65.]\r\n\r\nHis family was of equestrian rank, and originally came from Gaul. In\r\nA.D. 185, he was commander-in-chief of the army in Pannonia and\r\nIllyricum; and on the murder of Pertinax was elected Emperor. He\r\ndisbanded and banished the Prætorian guards, re-constituted the army,\r\nwhose fidelity he secured, and marched against his two rivals,\r\nPescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus, the first of whom had been\r\ndeclared Emperor in the East, and the last, in Gaul. Defeating them\r\nboth, he passed three years in the East, warring against the Parthians,\r\nwhom he subdued. In A.D. 208, he went to Britain, in order to punish the\r\nCaledonians. But before his design could be carried out, he fell himself\r\na victim--it is said to grief, to the dissensions of his sons--in the\r\ncity of York. He had many kingly qualities, but was without clemency. A\r\nrigid disciplinarian, simple and sober in his tastes.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n55. GORDIANUS--MARCUS ANTONIUS, surnamed AFRICANUS. _Roman Emperor_,\r\nA.D. 238.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, A.D. 157. Died at Carthage, in Africa, A.D. 238. Aged\r\n  80.]\r\n\r\nBorn of an honourable family, claiming high descent, and possessing\r\ngreat wealth. When Ædile, his public spectacles were pre-eminently\r\nmagnificent. At one of them 1000 gladiators fought at once. When\r\nappointed Pro-Consul in Africa, he was called “The New Scipio,” on\r\naccount of his popular manners. When eighty years of age he was forced\r\nto become Emperor by the people of Carthage, who would not submit to the\r\nferocious Maximinus. After a few months’ reign, however, he was attacked\r\nby Capellianus, the Procurator of Numidia, and hearing of the fall of\r\nhis son, strangled himself with his own belt. A man of extraordinary\r\nself-command and sobriety, and very studious. In his youth he composed a\r\npoem in thirty books; and, to his latest hour, he passed some portion of\r\nthe day in the study of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Virgil. In temper\r\ngentle and affectionate.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n56. COMMODUS--LUCIUS AURELIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 180-192.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Lanuvium, in Italy, A.D. 161. Died at Rome, A.D. 192. Aged\r\n  31.]\r\n\r\nSon of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina Junior. It is said that he was\r\nhandsome in form and feature. If history can be believed, he was a\r\nmonster in human form. He was cruel in hot and cold blood, vain,\r\ncowardly, impious. He appeared many times in the Circus as gladiator,\r\nand condescended to become a buffoon for the amusement of the lowest of\r\nhis people; but he is chiefly famous for his human butcheries. He was\r\npoisoned at last by his mistress, Marcia, who was only just in time to\r\nsave her own life, which had been already doomed by her sanguinary\r\nparamour. His death gave occasion to almost frantic joy in Rome.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n57. MACRINUS--MARCUS OPILIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 217-218.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cæsarea, in Numidia, A.D. 164. Died near Archelaïs, in\r\n  Cappadocia, A.D. 218. Aged 54.]\r\n\r\nAn Emperor of obscure birth. He is said to have been, in his youth, a\r\ngladiator. When Præfect of the Prætorian guards, he contrived the murder\r\nof Caracalla, then at Antioch, in order to fulfil the prophecy of a\r\nsoothsayer, who had predicted his accession to the throne. Elected\r\nEmperor by the soldiers, he was himself dethroned and assassinated in\r\nCappadocia, after a brief reign of fourteen months. He is represented as\r\nhaughty, bloodthirsty, cruel, and cowardly.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n58. PUPIENUS--MARCUS CLAUDIUS PUPIENUS MAXIMUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D.\r\n238.\r\n\r\n  [Born A.D. 164. Died at Rome, A.D. 238. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nCalled “the Sad” from the melancholy expression of his countenance. He\r\nwas of an obscure family, but a distinguished soldier. After the death\r\nof the two Gordiani, he was elected with Balbinus, by the senate, to the\r\nempire, in order to oppose Maximinus; but that tyrant was soon after\r\nmurdered by his own soldiers. The Prætorians, however, regretting\r\nMaximinus, assassinated the two Emperors when they were preparing to\r\ndepart on separate expeditions.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n59. MAXIMINUS--CAIUS JULIUS VERUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 235-238.\r\n\r\n  [Born on the confines of Thrace, A.D. 173. Died before Aquileia, A.D.\r\n  238. Aged 65.]\r\n\r\nAn Emperor of Gothic origin, who was originally a shepherd, and owed his\r\nelevation entirely to his physical power and stature. He stood eight\r\nfeet high, and was muscular in proportion. Serving with Alexander\r\nSeverus on the Rhine, he excited a mutiny in the troops, in which\r\nAlexander and his mother were assassinated, and he himself declared\r\nEmperor by the soldiers. His reign was marked by mad severity, cruelty,\r\nand rapacity, and was fiercely closed by a band of Prætorians, who broke\r\ninto his tent and slew him, having first put an end to his son before\r\nhis eyes. He was a rare monster. It is related that his thumb was of the\r\ngirth of a woman’s wrist; he could wear his wife’s bracelet as a ring:\r\nhis eyes were inordinately large; with a kick, he could break the leg of\r\na horse; and his appetite corresponded with his muscular development.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n60. CARACALLA. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 211-217.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Lyons in France, A.D. 188. Died in Mesopotamia, A.D. 217.\r\n  Aged 29.]\r\n\r\nIn early life remarkable for gentle and pleasing address; but on the\r\ndeath of his father, Septimius Severus, he assassinated his brother\r\nGeta, who was left, with himself, joint heir to the throne. Other crimes\r\nwere added, and, conscience-stricken, he soon gave rein to the passions\r\nof a madman. He oppressed his citizens by extortionate taxation, and\r\nplundered the world for the means of paying for his soldiers and his\r\namusements. He, however, erected some great monuments in Rome. He was\r\nassassinated in Mesopotamia by order of Macrinus, his chief officer.\r\n\r\n  [All busts of him show the peculiar deformed turn of the neck with\r\n  which he was afflicted.]\r\n\r\n61. GETA--PUBLIUS SEPTIMIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 211-212.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Milan, A.D. 189. Died A.D. 212. Aged 23.]\r\n\r\nThe second son of Septimius Severus. During his second Consulship\r\nproceeded to Britain (208) and obtained the surname of Britannicus. Upon\r\nthe death of his father, he and his brother Caracalla were declared\r\njoint successors to the Imperial crown; but Geta, at the instigation of\r\nCaracalla, was assassinated in the very arms of his mother, to whom he\r\nhad fled for refuge. Caracalla caused his brother’s statues to be\r\ndestroyed, and his inscriptions to be obliterated. Geta was depraved in\r\nhis habits, and unpolished, but not without some good qualities.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n62. GORDIANUS II.--MARCUS ANTONIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 238.\r\n\r\n  [Born, A.D. 192. Died at Carthage, in Africa, A.D. 238. Aged 46.]\r\n\r\nEldest son of Gordianus Africanus, with whom he was proclaimed Emperor,\r\nin Africa, in opposition to Maximinus. He was defeated and slain by\r\nCapellianus, the Procurator of Numidia, who remained faithful to\r\nMaximinus. His instructor, Serenus Sammonicus, left him heir to a large\r\nlibrary. Gordianus II. had a good knowledge of law, and cultivated\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n63. DECIUS--CAIUS MESSIUS QUINTUS TRAJANUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D.\r\n249-251.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bubalia, in Lower Pannonia, A.D. 201. Died near Abricium,\r\n  A.D. 251. Aged 50.]\r\n\r\nThe first of a long line of monarchs who traced an Illyrian ancestry. In\r\nA.D. 245, he was entrusted with an important command on the Danube.\r\nShortly afterwards he was ordered by the Emperor Philippus to calm the\r\nrebellious soldiery of Mœsia; but, on attempting to pacify them, he was\r\noffered, with a sword to his breast, the alternative of instant death or\r\nthe purple. Choosing the purple, he was opposed in the field by\r\nPhilippus, who fell. After reigning thirty months, he met his death in\r\nbattle against the Goths. During his short rule, the Christians were\r\nbitterly persecuted. It is difficult to form a just estimate of this\r\nEmperor’s character. He has been described as “most amiable, highly\r\naccomplished, mild, affable, and brave.” He has also been stigmatized as\r\na monster of iniquity.\r\n\r\n  [From the gallery of the Emperors in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n64. ALEXANDER SEVERUS--MARCUS AURELIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 222-235.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Arce, in Phœnicia, A.D. 205-208. Died in Gaul, A.D. 235.]\r\n\r\nElected Emperor on the death of Elagabalus, in A.D. 222. His reign was\r\nmarked by a gradual improvement in religion, morality, and politics. In\r\nA.D. 232, he drove the Persians under Artaxerxes, in defeat across the\r\nTigris. He was about to advance against the Germans, then ravaging Gaul,\r\nwhen he was murdered, together with his mother Julia Mamæa, by a band of\r\nmutinous soldiers, instigated by the ferocious Maximinus, who seized the\r\ncrown. His life was simple and pure; his government considerate and\r\njust. His death caused general regret.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n65. HELIOGABALUS or ELAGABALUS--VARIUS AVITUS BASSIANUS. _Roman\r\nEmperor_, A.D. 218-222.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Antioch, A.D. 204. Assassinated A.D. 222. Aged 18.]\r\n\r\nFrom his earliest years a priest of the Sun in the Temple of Emesa, in\r\nSyria: but by the intrigues of his grandmother, Julia Mæsa, declared\r\nEmperor of Rome, in place of Macrinus, whom he defeated in battle, and\r\nput to death. Elagabalus--so called from his sun-worship--the priest\r\ntaking the name of the God--introduced into Rome the superstitions in\r\nwhich he had been nurtured. By way of strengthening his power, his\r\ngrandmother induced him to associate with himself, in the government,\r\nhis cousin Alexander Severus. Repenting of this act, he was about to\r\nundo it, when a revolt of the Prætorians decided the question of rule by\r\nassassinating him and throwing his body into the Tiber. A more worthless\r\ncarcase had never floated down the polluted river. His vices were as\r\ngross as his superstitions. He left behind him a smirched and hated\r\nname.\r\n\r\n  [All Busts of him were ordered to be destroyed by the Senate: they are\r\n  consequently rare. This is from the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n66. GALLIENUS--PUBLIUS LICINIUS VALERIANUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D.\r\n253-268.\r\n\r\n  [Born A.D. 218. Died before Milan, A.D. 268. Aged 50.]\r\n\r\nSon of Valerian. When associated with his father in the empire, he\r\ncommanded with success against the barbarians on the Rhine and Danube.\r\nIn 260, Valerian was made captive by the Persians, and during the eight\r\nyears of his imprisonment, his son made no effort to release him. Rome,\r\nwhilst Gallienus reigned, was a prey to pestilence, internal rebellion,\r\nand the ravages of foreign nations. In A.D. 268, he laid siege to Milan,\r\nwhither Aureolus, an invader of his empire, had fled for refuge. During\r\nthe siege Gallienus fell--it is said by the hands of his own soldiers.\r\nHis character was very bad. He was cruel, treacherous, and indolent,\r\napathetic to public disaster, self-indulgent, frivolous, and a glutton.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n67. GORDIANUS III. or PIUS--MARCUS ANTONIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D.\r\n238-244.\r\n\r\n  [Born A.D. 224. Died near Castrum Circesium, in Mesopotamia, A.D. 244.\r\n  Aged 20.]\r\n\r\nAn emperor, endowed with many good qualities. He was son of the Consul\r\nJunius Balbus and Metia Faustina, daughter of Gordianus Africanus. When\r\nsixteen years old he married the beautiful and virtuous daughter of\r\nMisitheus, a wise and eloquent man, whom he appointed Prefect of the\r\nPrætorians, and by whose prudent advice he was successfully guided. Upon\r\nthe death of this able minister, Philip the Arabian contrived to\r\nassociate himself in the government with Gordianus, who shortly\r\nafterwards fell a victim, it is supposed, to the conspiracies of his\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n68. CAIUS JULIUS VERUS MAXIMUS. _Roman Prince._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died at Aquileia, A.D. 238. Aged 18\r\n  or 21.]\r\n\r\nSon of the Emperor Maximinus, who, on his accession to the purple in\r\n235, raised him to the rank of Cæsar. Well educated, vain of his\r\npersonal beauty, and haughty of demeanour, but not evil disposed. He was\r\nmassacred with his father at Aquileia by the rebel Prætorians.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n69. PHILIP THE YOUNGER.--MARCUS JULIUS PHILIPPUS II. _Roman Prince._\r\n\r\n  [Born (place unknown), A.D. 237. Died A.D. 249. Aged 12.]\r\n\r\nSon of Philip I., Emperor of Rome. When seven years old dignified with\r\nthe title of Cæsar. When ten years old chosen Consul, and shared the\r\nempire under the title of Augustus. A child of singularly serious\r\ntemperament. He could never be induced to laugh, and would turn away his\r\nhead when his father indulged in merriment.\r\n\r\n  [From the Statue Gallery of the Vatican.]\r\n\r\n70. CARINUS--MARCUS AURELIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 283-285.\r\n\r\n  [Born probably at Rome, A.D. 249. Died in Moesia, A.D. 285. Aged 36.]\r\n\r\nEldest son of the Emperor Carus. Was appointed to the command of the\r\nWestern Provinces, A.D. 282. In A.D. 283, on the death of his father,\r\nwas associated in the government with his brother Numerianus, who was\r\nassassinated when Diocletian was proclaimed Emperor by the army in\r\nAsia. Carinus marched against Diocletian, but in the moment of triumph\r\nhe was slain by one of his own officers, whose domestic happiness he had\r\ndestroyed. Carinus was a brave and skilful general, but a profligate and\r\nvicious man. He was sensual and ferocious.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n71. JULIAN THE APOSTATE--FLAVIUS CLAUDIUS JULIANUS. _Roman Emperor_,\r\nA.D. 361-363.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Constantinople, A.D. 331. Died in Persia, A.D. 363. Aged 32.]\r\n\r\nUnquestionably a ruler of extraordinary capacity and power. He was the\r\nnephew of Constantine the Great, and was brought up in strict seclusion\r\nby the Christians, in order to save him from Constantius II., who, upon\r\nhis accession, had murdered the male members of Julian’s family. He\r\nwithdrew for a time to Athens; was thence recalled by the relenting\r\nConstantius, and invested with command in Gaul. He resided chiefly in\r\nParis, and it is worthy of note that at a time of scarcity in that city,\r\nJulian drew his supplies of corn from England. During his stay in Gaul,\r\nthe soldiers proclaimed him Emperor. He marched against Constantinople,\r\nbut before he reached the city Constantius had died. Julian, created\r\nEmperor, renounced Christianity for the Paganism of Greece; hence the\r\nname which he has carried as a brand ever since. The Heathens extol this\r\nprince, the Christians blame him. His life at least was pure, and his\r\nrule sagacious; and, although he naturally hated his former\r\nco-religionists, he was no religious persecutor. After his accession to\r\nthe throne he carried war into Persia, where he was slain in battle. He\r\nwas a prince of profound knowledge, of great eloquence, and remarkable\r\nfor philosophic calm. He professed Stoicism. He was also a writer, and\r\nmany of his works, displaying reflexion and inquiring thought, have come\r\ndown to us.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome. A very interesting\r\n  statue of Julian will be found described under No. 92, Handbook of\r\n  Greek Court.]\r\n\r\n72. DIOCLETIAN--CAIUS VALERIUS AURELIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 284-305.\r\n\r\n  [Born in Dalmatia, A.D. 245. Died A.D. 313. Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nAt first a simple soldier, he rose by his own merit to the rank of\r\nCaptain of the Palace Guard, an office which he held until the death of\r\nNumerianus, when he was declared his successor. He associated Maximianus\r\nwith him in the empire, and appointed Constantius Chlorus and Galerius,\r\nCæsars. At the instigation of Galerius he barbarously persecuted the\r\nChristians. In A.D. 305, he resigned the empire in consequence of\r\ngrowing infirmities, and withdrew to Salona, where he cultivated his own\r\ngarden and lived in philosophical retirement. Whilst he held power, he\r\nthought less of the freedom and dignity of Rome, than of maintaining the\r\npower of the sovereign, and of securing a regular succession. His\r\ncruelty to the Christians has caused his reign to be described as “The\r\nAge of Martyrs.”\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum.]\r\n\r\n73. CONSTANTIUS CHLORUS--FLAVIUS VALERIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D.\r\n305-306.\r\n\r\n  [Born A.D. 250. Died at York, in England, A.D. 306. Aged 55.]\r\n\r\nThe father of Constantine, surnamed “the Great,” who was founder of\r\nConstantinople. Constantius governed, as colleague of Diocletian,\r\nbeyond the Alps, and his dominion extended over Gaul, Britain, and\r\nSpain. He died in England whilst preparing for an expedition against the\r\nScots. He was the best of the later Roman Emperors, having a regard to\r\nthe welfare of his people, and exhibiting no rapacity in his\r\nadministration. In religious matters he was mild and tolerant, showing\r\ngreat humanity towards the Christians. He had excellent talents, and was\r\nsurnamed “Chlorus,” or “the pale,” from the pallor of his countenance.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n74. HOSTILIANUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 251 or 252.\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died A.D. 251 or 252.]\r\n\r\nGenerally regarded as the second son of the Emperor Decius, whom he\r\nsurvived. Declared Cæsar in A.D. 249, and was afterwards adopted by\r\nTrebonianus Gallus as his colleague in the empire. Died either of poison\r\nor the plague.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n75. VOLUSIANUS--CAIUS VIBIUS. _Roman Emperor_, A.D. 252-254.\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died at Interamna, in Italy, A.D.\r\n  253 or 254.]\r\n\r\nSon of the Emperor Gallus, with whom he reigned, being elected Augustus\r\nin A.D. 252. Little is known of his life or character. When Æmilianus\r\nwas chosen Emperor, he went with Gallus to oppose him; but, before a\r\nbattle could be fought, father and son were slain by their own troops.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n76*. MAGNUS DECENTIUS. _Roman Prince._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died at Sens, in Gaul, A.D. 353.]\r\n\r\nA brother or cousin of the Emperor Flavius Magnentius. Nominated Cæsar,\r\nA.D. 351, he went into Gaul, and suffered defeat in defending that\r\ncountry against the Germans. He strangled himself upon hearing of the\r\ndefeat and deposition of his brother by Constantius, who succeeded to\r\nthe throne of Magnentius.\r\n\r\n  [For an account of a curious head of this Prince, placed in the\r\n  Bas-relief gallery, see Handbook to Greek Court, No. 217.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAVENUE IN FRONT OF ROMAN COURT.\r\n\r\n(_Numbers continuing at the end next to the Greek Court._)\r\n\r\n77.

ANTINOUS. _Bithynian youth._\r\n\r\n  [Died in Egypt, A.D. 132.]\r\n\r\nCelebrated for his beauty. He was the page and companion of the Roman\r\nEmperor Hadrian, whom he accompanied to Egypt. He was drowned in the\r\nNile, and the Emperor was inconsolable for his loss. On the spot where\r\nhe died, the city of Antinœa was raised; temples and statues in Egypt\r\nand Greece were erected to his memory; and in Greece, coins were struck\r\nin his honour. The numerous representations of his beauty gave a fresh\r\nimpulse to the Fine Arts, and may be compared with the works of the best\r\nperiods of Grecian Sculpture.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre; the head bound with a fillet of vine.\r\n  For account of the many beautiful statues of Antinous see Handbook to\r\n  Roman Court and Nave.]\r\n\r\n  81.}\r\n     }\r\n  82.}\r\n     } _Four duplicate busts removed._\r\n  83.}\r\n     }\r\n  84.}\r\n\r\n85.

In 249,\r\nhe was declared Cæsar, and in 251, Augustus, as the colleague of his\r\nfather Decius. In a battle fought near Abricium, between the Emperor\r\nDecius and the Goths, both he and his father were slain.\r\n\r\n  [From the Capitoline Museum.]\r\n\r\n90.

Died, probably at Rome, A.D.\r\n  223.]\r\n\r\nDaughter to a Priest of the Sun. When her sister, Julia Domna, as wife\r\nof Septimius Severus, became Empress, Julia Mæsa resided at the Imperial\r\nCourt. Her bold political intrigues placed her grandson Elagabalus on\r\nthe throne. Against law, she was made a member of the Senate. She bore\r\nthe title of Augusta to her death, and was afterwards deified. A woman\r\nof powerful mind, unscrupulously ambitious, but using power well.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Gallery of the Emperors, in the Capitol, at\r\n  Rome.]\r\n\r\n92. SABINA.\r\n\r\n  [Died probably A.D. 137.]\r\n\r\nWife of the Emperor Hadrian, and grandniece of Trajan. Ill treated by\r\nher husband, by whom, it is said, she was poisoned. Others assert that\r\nin despair she put an end to her life. She was deified after her\r\ndecease.\r\n\r\n  [From the original in alabaster in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT OF THE ROMAN LADIES.\r\n\r\n(_Numbers commencing on the right._)\r\n\r\n93. LIVIA DRUSILLA. _Roman Empress._\r\n\r\n  [Born B.C. 56-54. Died A.D. 29.]\r\n\r\nMarried to Tiberius Claudius Nero, a Roman general; but her beauty\r\ncaptivating the Triumvir Octavian, afterwards Augustus, her divorce was\r\neffected, and she became the Triumvir’s wife. A consummate actress, full\r\nof craft and dissimulation, possessing great knowledge of the world,\r\nand, by an affected purity of life, maintaining to the last her\r\ninfluence over the mind of Augustus. She successfully intrigued for the\r\nsuccession in favour of Tiberius, her son by her first marriage, and, it\r\nis said, removed by poison the grandsons of Augustus, who stood in the\r\nway of her own offspring. Tiberius became Emperor, and repaid the\r\nservice by base ingratitude. He removed his mother from all share in the\r\ngovernment, declined all intercourse with her, refused to see her when\r\nshe was dying, and rejoiced, in open show, at her death.\r\n\r\n94*. DOMNA--JULIA (PIA FELIX AUGUSTA). _Roman Empress._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Emesa, in Syria, about A.D. 170. Died A.D. 217.]\r\n\r\nA woman of humble origin, but beautiful, ambitious and crafty. She\r\nbecame the wife of Septimius Severus, then of the rank of general, and\r\nacquired boundless influence over his mind, persuading him that a\r\nprophecy had destined her to become the wife of an Emperor, and inciting\r\nhim to labour to that end. After the death of her husband, her son Geta\r\nwas murdered in her arms by his brother Caracalla; and after the\r\nsuccessful revolt of Macrinus, being suspected of treason, she, possibly\r\nto avoid punishment, starved herself to death.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Rotunda of the Vatican. This colossal head\r\n  will be found No. 334, Roman Court.]\r\n\r\n95*. JULIA, daughter of AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, B.C. 39. Died at Rhegium, A.D. 14. Aged 53.]\r\n\r\nThe daughter of the Roman Emperor by his third wife Scribonia. Strictly\r\nbrought up, she was married at fourteen to Marcellus. Left a widow at\r\nsixteen, she was forced by her father to marry the veteran Agrippa, by\r\nwhom she had three sons and two daughters. Her conduct dissolute and\r\nunrestrained. Agrippa dying, she married again Tiberius Nero (afterwards\r\nemperor) who left her in disgust. She was banished by her father until\r\nthe accession of Tiberius, when she suffered still harsher exile.\r\nConsumption killed her. In spite of her vices, the people of Rome loved\r\nher for her frank and lively manner, and frequently solicited Augustus\r\nto recall her.\r\n\r\n  [For further account of this graceful Statue of Julia, see No. 229, of\r\n  Handbook to Roman Court, and Nave.]\r\n\r\n96. AGRIPPINA--THE ELDER.\r\n\r\n  [Born B.C. 15. Died A.D. 33. Aged 48.]\r\n\r\nDaughter of Vipsanius Agrippa, and wife of Cæsar Germanicus, to whom she\r\nbore nine children. Accompanied her husband in all his campaigns, and\r\naided him by her cool foresight and energetic will: once, on the Rhine,\r\nin his absence, by her heroic resistance to the timid counsels of those\r\nabout her, saving the relics of an army. On his death in Asia, she\r\nreturned to Rome, whence she was banished by Tiberius, jealous of her\r\npopularity. After three years’ persecution and suffering, she\r\ndied--possibly by her own hand. She had all the lofty qualities of a\r\nRoman matron--nobility of soul, purity, and a devoted love for her\r\nhusband and children. Tacitus says of her, that “the cares which belong\r\nto men supplanted, in her mind, the vices common to her sex.”\r\n\r\n  [From the seated Statue, for account of which, see No. 281, of\r\n  Hand-book to Roman Court, and Nave.]\r\n\r\n97. AGRIPPINA THE YOUNGER. _Roman Empress._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Oppidum Ubiorum (Cologne), A.D. 14-17. Died at Rome, A.D.\r\n  60.]\r\n\r\nThe ruthless and dissolute daughter of noble parents--of Germanicus and\r\nAgrippina the elder. The unenviable mother of the madman, Nero. Upon the\r\ndeath of her second husband, whom she was accused of poisoning, she\r\nmarried her uncle Claudius, whom she induced to nominate Nero for his\r\nsuccessor, excluding his own son. She poisoned her uncle-husband, and\r\nreceived her reward from her son, the matricide,--dying by hands\r\ncommissioned by him to the murder. Tacitus speaks of some interesting\r\nmemoirs of her time, written by Agrippina, to which he had access in\r\nwriting his history. She was beautiful, but ambitious, and as wicked as\r\nshe proved unfortunate.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n98. VALERIA MESSALINA. _Roman Empress._\r\n\r\n  [Born, uncertain. Died at Rome, A.D. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe third wife of the Emperor Claudius I. Her name has become a bye-word\r\nfor profligacy. A murderess. Herself pierced through the breast by the\r\nsword of a tribune entrusted with the execution of one of her victims.\r\nThe slave of lust, avarice, and ambition. Difficult to find in history a\r\nwoman more blackened by crime than Valeria Messalina.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n99. PLOTINA--POMPEIA. _Roman Empress._\r\n\r\n  [Date, and place of birth and death unknown.]\r\n\r\nThe wife of the Emperor Trajan. A woman of clear, strong mind, and an\r\nexemplary purity of life and consistency of character. Childless\r\nherself, she prevailed upon her husband to adopt Hadrian, in whose reign\r\nshe died. Hadrian built a temple in her honour, and composed hymns in\r\nher praise.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Rotunda of the Vatican.]\r\n\r\n100. MATIDIA.\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown.]\r\n\r\nThe niece of Trajan. Declared Augusta, A.D. 113, and after death,\r\ndeified.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n101. CRISPINA.\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died at Capreæ, A.D. 183.]\r\n\r\nWas married to the Roman Emperor Commodus, A.D. 177, but divorced for\r\ninfidelity, banished, and put to death in her exile. She was very\r\nbeautiful and ambitious.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n102. MAMÆA--JULIA. _Roman Empress._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Emesa, in Syria (date unknown). Died in Gaul, A.D. 235.]\r\n\r\nThe mother of Alexander Severus, for whom she governed wisely during his\r\nminority. With many virtues, she possessed what, in the eyes of the\r\nRoman soldiers, was invariably considered as a great vice--she was an\r\neconomist in her expenditure; and, disgusting the army by recommending\r\nretrenchments, she gave occasion to a mutiny, to which she and her son\r\nAlexander both fell victims. It is said that, whilst at Antioch, she\r\nreceived instruction from Origen in the Christian faith.\r\n\r\n  [From the very beautiful Bust in the Florence Gallery.]\r\n\r\n102A. MAMÆA--JULIA. _Roman Empress._\r\n\r\n  [The same as preceding, in advanced age.]\r\n\r\n103. SALONINA--CORNELIA. _Roman Empress._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died before Milan, A.D. 268.]\r\n\r\nSupposed to have been of Greek origin. Was the wife of the Emperor\r\nGallienus, and dignified with the title of Augusta upon his ascending\r\nthe throne. She cultivated literature and philosophy, and was the\r\nprotector of Plotinus the philosopher. She is described as a woman of\r\ngreat good sense, and exceeding benevolence. She roused him to repel the\r\nbarbarians, and accompanied his army that she might attend to the wants\r\nof the soldiers. She was massacred with her husband and youngest son\r\nbefore Milan.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitol at Rome.]\r\n\r\n104. MARINIANA.\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth and death unknown.]\r\n\r\nLittle is known respecting this Princess, who was either wife, sister,\r\nor daughter of the Emperor Valerian, and died at least four years before\r\nhis Persian expedition. Some coins, having on the obverse her name and a\r\nveiled head, were struck, A.D. 254.\r\n\r\n105. FAUSTINA JUNIOR--ANNIA FAUSTINA.\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died A.D. 175.]\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Antoninus Pius, and wife of Marcus Aurelius, whom she\r\naccompanied into Asia, and there died suddenly. One of the most\r\nabandoned and dissolute of the Roman Empresses, yet her virtuous husband\r\npreserved his first affection for her to the last; and, on the spot\r\nwhere she died, erected to her honour the city of Faustinopolis.\r\n\r\n  [From the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.

Died A.D. 65.]\r\n\r\n“She possessed,” says Tacitus, “everything but a virtuous mind.” She\r\nbecame the wife of the Emperor Nero, after having been his mistress; at\r\nher instigation Nero’s mother was killed by him, and his former wife,\r\nOctavia, divorced and put to death. She was herself destroyed by a\r\nbrutal blow from Nero, who pronounced her eulogium at the tomb. “As he\r\ncould not,” says Tacitus, “speak of her virtues, he enlarged upon her\r\nbeauty.” She was deified, and honoured with a temple. Her luxurious\r\ntastes were extravagant. It is related that her mules were shod with\r\ngold; and that when she travelled, she was followed by five hundred\r\nasses, whose milk furnished a bath to preserve her complexion.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT OF ROMAN GENERALS AND POETS.\r\n\r\nADJOINING THE COURT OF ROMAN LADIES.\r\n\r\n(_Numbers commencing on the right._)\r\n\r\n107. LUCIUS JUNIUS BRUTUS. _Roman Consul._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown.]\r\n\r\nThe first Consul, and one of the Founders, of the Roman Republic. Before\r\nhe was elected to the Consulate in B.C. 509, he had been the main cause\r\nof the expulsion of royalty from Rome in the persons of Tarquin and his\r\nsons. He fell in battle whilst defending, as Consul, the infant Republic\r\nagainst the royal exiles fighting for their restoration. These are\r\nadmitted facts in the life of Lucius Junius Brutus. His assumption of\r\nidiotcy during the reign of the Tarquins, in order to carry on with\r\ngreater safety his patriotic designs, and his connexion with the\r\naffecting history of the devoted Lucretia, are events which in recent\r\nyears have passed from the grave volume of history to the more\r\nfascinating pages of poetry. Philosophical historians permit us to sing,\r\nbut no longer to believe in, the once cherished narratives of earliest\r\nRome. The act, whether historical or merely traditionary, which the most\r\nmemorably distinguishes his name, is that of ordering the execution of\r\nhis two sons, convicted of conspiring for the restoration of the\r\nTarquins.\r\n\r\n  [From the bronze in the Palazzo dei Conservatori of the Capitol at\r\n  Rome.]\r\n\r\n108. MARCELLUS--M. CLAUDIUS. _Roman General._\r\n\r\n  [Born about B.C. 268. Died in Apulia, B.C. 208. Aged about 60.]\r\n\r\nA Roman of high fame. At his hands Hannibal received the first check\r\nthat he experienced in Italy. He subsequently besieged Syracuse, but was\r\nforced to convert the siege into a blockade in consequence of the genius\r\ndisplayed in the defence of the city by the great Archimedes, who\r\nrendered of no avail every engine brought against Syracuse, and inspired\r\ndread by his own instruments of war. At length Marcellus triumphed, the\r\ncity was given over to pillage, and its defender perished, whilst\r\npondering over a geometrical problem, by the hand of a common soldier.\r\nHe again turned his victorious arms against Hannibal, winning fresh\r\nlaurels and new honours from the state. It was whilst fighting against\r\nthe Carthaginian hero that he fell, slain by a spear of the enemy.\r\nHannibal sympathized with his fall, and paid honour to his remains. A\r\nplain, stern, unlettered soldier, brave to recklessness, rude and\r\nunpolished in manners, unyielding in temper.\r\n\r\n  [This Bust bears the name of Marcellus in the Capitoline Museum. It\r\n  may be the nephew of Augustus when a child.]\r\n\r\n109. SCIPIO--PUBLIUS CORNELIUS AFRICANUS MAJOR. _Roman General._\r\n\r\n  [Born probably at Rome, B.C. 234. Died at Liternum, in Campania, B.C.\r\n  183. Aged 51.]\r\n\r\nSon of Publius Cornelius Scipio, whose life he saved in the battle of\r\nthe Ticinus. One of the few Roman generals who survived the fatal battle\r\nof Cannæ, and chosen with Appius Claudius to command the remains of the\r\narmy. Went as Prætor or Pro-Consul to Spain at the age of 24, where he\r\ntook Carthagena, gained the battle of Bœcula, and recovered the whole\r\ncountry. Forcing Hannibal, the victorious Carthaginian general, to carry\r\nthe theatre of war to Africa, he gained the celebrated victory of Zama,\r\nwhich decided the long conflict between Rome and Carthage for dominion.\r\nReceived the surname of Africanus in consequence, but, vexed with the\r\ningratitude of his countrymen he withdrew to Liternum, where he died.\r\nLike Mahomet and Cromwell, he believed himself the special instrument of\r\nHeaven. He was undoubtedly the greatest man of his age, and one of the\r\nfirst of the Roman worthies. The affectionate friend of the poet Ennius,\r\nand the patron of literature. The Spaniards, for his virtues, would have\r\nmade him king.\r\n\r\n  [From the Capitol at Rome. Many busts of this great general are in\r\n  existence.

Died at Utica, in Africa, B.C. 46. Aged 49.]\r\n\r\nOne of the classical undying forms reared in antiquity to symbolize high\r\nmoral purity, unquenchable love of liberty, and the sternest virtue.\r\nCato answers to the idea of Roman patriotism, as Julius Cæsar to that of\r\nRoman conquest. Before this one we stand, wondering at human power;\r\nbefore that, subdued by the might of the highest moral excellence. Cato\r\nas a child was grave, pains-taking, resolute, tenacious; as he grew, he\r\nbecame strong in the love of virtue, and in his hatred of oppression.\r\nAttached to the philosophy of the Stoics, he aimed at happiness through\r\nits teaching. He had served with honour many offices in Rome when\r\nPompey, Cæsar, and Crassus found it necessary to remove him to Cyprus,\r\nin order that his patriotism might offer no obstacle to their ambitious\r\nschemes. Returning to Rome, he was made Prætor, the highest office he\r\never held. At the breaking out of the civil war he was entrusted by the\r\nsenate with the defence of Sicily: he afterwards joined Pompey.\r\nSubsequently to the battle of Pharsalia, at which he was not present, he\r\nsailed to Africa in search of Pompey. Suffering defeat at Thapsus, he\r\ncommitted self-destruction. Before the fatal act he read Plato’s Phædon\r\nseveral times through. His death caused great grief. It was mourned by\r\ngreat Cæsar himself, who grudged Cato his death, since Cato grudged him\r\nthe glory of sparing his life.\r\n\r\n  [Double bust representing Cato and his daughter Porcia; it is from the\r\n  Capitoline Museum, but possesses no especial authenticity.]\r\n\r\n111. JULIUS CÆSAR. _Roman Dictator._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, B.C. 100. Died there, B.C. 44. Aged 56.]\r\n\r\nThe mightiest amongst the mighty of men. At the outset of his career he\r\nserved in Asia, where he won a civic wreath. Subsequently made Consul in\r\nRome (B.C. 59); and, at the close of his term of office, appointed to\r\nthe government of Gaul--which country in nine years he wholly subjugated\r\nto Roman rule. His invasion of Britain is amongst the earliest\r\nrecollections of the English schoolboy. The renowned Commentaries of\r\nJulius Cæsar graphically narrate these deeds. Rousing the jealousy of\r\nPompey, in Rome, by his splendid achievements, he marched into\r\nItaly--afterwards into Spain, in order to crush the adherents of Pompey,\r\nand then returned to Rome in triumph, to be created Dictator. As\r\nDictator he overcame his rival in the battle of Pharsalia, in Thessaly.\r\nHe performed fresh service to the state in Egypt, and going back to Rome\r\nin order to advance the social and material prosperity of his country,\r\nhe fell a victim to a conspiracy, of which Brutus and Cassius were at\r\nthe head. Twice had the crown been offered to him, and twice had he\r\nrefused it. No Roman before his time had ever won such honour as was\r\nheaped upon his head. He suffered from epilepsy, and was very\r\nabstemious. He was tall, fair and slight--very careful of his person,\r\nconcealing his baldness by a laurel crown. His was indeed a head\r\ninwreathed with palms. He was a great captain, a great statesman, a\r\ngreat orator--a great writer. He had innate personal intrepidity,\r\ninstantaneous decision, answering celerity of action, resources to meet\r\nevery emergency, consummate military skill, an unshaken presence of\r\nmind, a trust--whether in his fortune, as he said, or in himself--which\r\nstill augured and still conquered success. He had also the most implicit\r\nconfidence in his troops, whom he treated ever as companions and\r\nbrothers in arms. Intellectual action in him was without labour. It was\r\nsubtle, comprehensive, rapid, luminous, self-possessed. He dictated to\r\nfive secretaries at once, on different subjects: his strokes of\r\neloquence in the Senate, as his strokes of action in the field, were\r\nquick and irresistible. In the terrible civil war of the dissolving\r\nRepublic--a war wasteful of Roman blood in the field,--thirstier for the\r\nflow of the same drear beverage by the axe and the dagger,--there, where\r\nthe sole sad policy of the victor hitherto was revenge, Cæsar tried the\r\nnovel art of forgiveness: although in his Gaulish conquests--when the\r\nbarbarian stands before him--he looks to us, by his own reporting,\r\nsanguinary and merciless. By toil and spare diet, he hardened a feeble\r\nhealth for any work. A civilian, with but a taste, in youth, of war,\r\nhe, at forty, stepped into command, at once a supreme commander.\r\nRecklessly licentious, yet no intellect could be keener, healthier, and\r\nmore vigorous. His writings, with the simplicity of a soldier, have the\r\nclearness and precision of a grammarian. And why not, since we know that\r\nin the versatility of his genius, he wrote two books on grammar. In the\r\nhistory of the world, Julius Cæsar was a power. In the records of\r\npsychology a wonder.\r\n\r\n  [From the bronze in the Florence Gallery. He wore the front of his\r\n  head shaven. It resembles the bronze medals of Cæsar, but is suspected\r\n  to be modern. He is said to have been sensitive on account of his\r\n  baldness, and this bust shows the hair combed forward to hide it.

MARCUS JUNIUS BRUTUS. _Roman General._\r\n\r\n  [Born B.C. 85. Died B.C. 42. Aged 43.]\r\n\r\nThe friend of Cicero--the fellow conspirator of Cassius--one of those\r\nwho shared in the deed memorable to all time--questionable in its\r\nown--of killing Julius Cæsar. From his earliest youth, and through life,\r\nabsorbed in study and self-contemplation, to the detriment of his powers\r\nas a man of action. He was much attached to Cato, whom he accompanied to\r\nCyprus, when it was found necessary to remove the republican leaders\r\nfrom Rome. We are accustomed to think of Brutus--Shakspeare being\r\ngreatly answerable for the thought--as standing aloof from the vulgar\r\nambition and desires of his fellow-men; yet we find him in Cilicia (B.C.\r\n53), growing rich by letting out money at usurious interest. In the\r\ncivil war of Pompey and Cæsar he took part with Pompey; Cæsar, however,\r\ngave orders that at the battle of Pharsalia his person should be sacred.\r\nGrateful for the consideration, Brutus, upon the defeat of Pompey, asked\r\npardon from Cæsar, which was generously accorded. In B.C. 48, appointed\r\nby Cæsar governor of Cisalpine Gaul: the inhabitants of which, delighted\r\nwith his mild treatment of them, and his justice, honoured him with\r\npublic monuments. Four years later he joined the conspiracy against his\r\npatron, and burdened his hand with the death of that great soldier. Then\r\ntook up arms against Antony; but suffering defeat at Philippi, fell by\r\nhis own sword. His reading and varied knowledge were immense: he was\r\nspeculative, superstitious, and highly imaginative. His aspirations pure\r\nand noble, but his practical ability small, and his judgment imperfect\r\nand too easily led. He wrote much, his chief productions being his\r\norations.\r\n\r\n  [From the Capitol at Rome, where it stands in the same gallery as the\r\n  Dying Gladiator (No. 309) in the Nave.]\r\n\r\n113. M. VIPSANIUS AGRIPPA. _Roman General._\r\n\r\n  [Born B.C. 63. Died in Campania, B.C. 12. Aged 51.]\r\n\r\nHis victories mainly contributed to make the Emperor Augustus, whose\r\ndaughter he married, master of the Roman Empire: and he was the chief\r\nsupport of the rising monarchical institution in Rome. He spent much\r\nmoney on public works, erected several public buildings, including the\r\nPantheon and the Julian aqueduct; was a patron of the fine Arts, and\r\ndying, bequeathed his goods and his gardens to the people of Rome.\r\n\r\n  [From a Bust in the Louvre.]\r\n\r\n114. NERO CLAUDIUS DRUSUS. _Roman General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, B.C. 38. Died B.C. 9. Aged 29.]\r\n\r\nA son of Livia who married the Emperor Augustus, and brother of\r\nTiberius. Victorious in Gaul and Germany. Unflinchingly firm and severe\r\ntowards all who resisted him, but generous to those who trusted and\r\nsubmitted to him. He married Antonia, the daughter of Marc Antony. His\r\nknown desire to see the commonwealth restored endeared him to the Roman\r\npeople. Died in Germany, from an injury sustained in a fall from his\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome. See also a statue\r\n  of him, No. 222, Roman Court.]\r\n\r\n115. GERMANICUS CÆSAR. _Roman General._\r\n\r\n  [Born B.C. 15. Died at Antioch, in Syria, A.D. 19. Aged 34.]\r\n\r\nSon of Nero Claudius Drusus, and his wife Antonia; was adopted by\r\nTiberius, at the request of Augustus. Occupied for a time in an\r\nexterminating war against the eastern Germans. Afterwards appointed by\r\nTiberius supreme ruler of the eastern provinces. Died at Antioch, where,\r\nit is supposed, he was poisoned by the governor of the place. A man of\r\nsensitive feeling, temperate, and virtuous. Remarkable for the dignity\r\nof his person, for captivating eloquence, munificence, and unaffected\r\ncourtesy; but credulous, nervous, and a believer in magic. Idolized by\r\nhis soldiers, and popular with the multitude.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitol, at Rome.

CORBULO--CNEIUS DOMITIUS. _Roman General._\r\n\r\n  [Date and place of birth unknown. Died at Cenchreæ, in Greece, A.D.\r\n  67.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated generals of his age, and brother-in-law of\r\nCaligula. He composed some military memoirs after the manner of Cæsar’s\r\nCommentaries, but they have not been preserved. He was a good\r\ndisciplinarian, and cautious as well as brave. He commanded against the\r\nParthians, and was victorious in every engagement. After Nero’s\r\naccession, he continued faithful to his new master, who summoned him to\r\nGreece, and for his fidelity greeted him with an order for execution on\r\nhis landing at Cenchreæ. He stabbed himself with his own sword. His\r\ndaughter Domitia Longina, celebrated for her beauty and vices, was the\r\nwife of the Emperor Domitian.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Gallery of Philosophers, of the Capitoline\r\n  Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n117. DECIMUS CLODIUS CEIONIUS SEPTIMIUS ALBINUS. _Roman General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Adrumetum, in Africa. Date not known. Died at Lugdunum\r\n  (Lyons), in Gaul, A.D. 197.]\r\n\r\nEntered the army at an early age, and served with distinction under\r\nMarcus Aurelius. Held a command in Gaul, and afterwards in Britain,\r\nunder Commodus. After the murder of Pertinax, the successor of Commodus,\r\nClodius was proclaimed Emperor in Britain by the British legions, and\r\nshared the purple with Septimius Severus. Subsequently discarded by\r\nSeverus, he put himself at the head of his legions, and met his\r\ncolleague in battle at Lugdunum, in Gaul, where he fell. He was of great\r\nbeauty and strength, and was called by his father “Albinus,” on account\r\nof the great whiteness of his skin. A skilful general, but severe:\r\nstyled by some, the “Catiline” of his time.\r\n\r\n  [From the gallery of the Emperors, in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n118. TERENCE--PUBLIUS TERENTIUS. _Latin Comic Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Carthage, B.C. 195. Died (place uncertain), B.C. 159. Aged\r\n  36.]\r\n\r\nThe second and last of the Latin comic poets--Plautus being the\r\nfirst--whose plays have descended to our time. He was the slave of a\r\nRoman senator, who, having regard to his talents and handsome person,\r\ngave him his liberty: on which occasion the freedman assumed his\r\npatron’s name--Terentius. In person, he was thin and of the middle\r\nheight, with an olive complexion. Terence is the one Latin writer in\r\nwhom the stateliness and the lofty strength, seemingly inherent in the\r\nlanguage of Rome, at once ceases: and the tongue which we had deemed fit\r\nonly to be spoken by the Kings of the world,---by the Fathers convened\r\nin the temple of Capitoline Jove,--gently condescends to the hearts and\r\nthe hearths of men. In the six preserved comedies of his--both by the\r\ndelineation of the characters, and by the strain of their speaking--we\r\nfeel ourselves in the familiar presence of known humanity. Not but that\r\nthe manner implies delicate choice and thoughtful art; but its easy,\r\nnatural air deceives the belief in the actual study. The words rise up\r\nfrom the heart, to drop from the lip. In the dialogue of Terence, the\r\nbarrier that hitherto has stood inflexibly between the modern and the\r\nantique world has fallen. We are at home in the Roman theatre. To great\r\npurity, grace, tenderness, the style adds, even in description, or\r\nnarrative, or continuous argument, that utter simplicity and obviousness\r\nof the sense, which is found in the most trivial uses of speech.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Stanza dei Filosofi of the Capitol, at Rome.\r\n  On the right shoulder is sculptured the histrionic mask, a curious\r\n  fancy of the artist, which may have been suggested by the custom in\r\n  Egyptian portraiture, of carving the name in a small “cartouche” on\r\n  the shoulder, a practice alluded to in the scriptures.]\r\n\r\n119. QUINTUS HORTENSIUS. _Roman Orator._\r\n\r\n  [Born B.C. 113. Died B.C. 49. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nHe employed his great oratorical powers in the defence of Sylla, and of\r\nthe aristocratic party to which he had attached himself. Cicero styled\r\nhim “rex judiciorum.” He defended Verres against Cicero: and the triumph\r\nof Cicero on that occasion threw Hortensius ever after into the second\r\nrank. He acquired great wealth, and lived luxuriously. His oratory was\r\nof the florid kind, and greatly aided by gesticulation; he had a\r\nretentive memory, and a sweetly sonorous voice.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Villa Albani, Rome. The Bust is inscribed with\r\n  his name. It was found together with the bust of Isocrates (No. 15).]\r\n\r\n120. CICERO--MARCUS TULLIUS. _Roman Orator._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Arpinum, B.C. 106. Died at Formiae, B.C. 43. Aged 63.]\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged greatest name in Roman eloquence. A man diligent in\r\naccomplishing himself by various study, and wonderfully gifted with the\r\npower of clothing thought in copious and musical words. He is less\r\ndistinguished as an original thinker. He frequented the schools of the\r\nphilosophers, but seemed in heart more dedicated to the worldly ambition\r\nof power and fame than to the studious zeal of truth. He courted\r\npopularity, and lived in anticipated immortality. He was an ambiguous\r\npartisan, waiting to be directed by victory to the side which he should\r\nembrace. He loved to throw an air of philosophical reflexion over\r\nquestions of human affairs; and his expression of these reflexions is\r\nfelt even to this day as singularly felicitous. We quote his words,\r\nbecause we can find no apter expression yet for the permanent thoughts.\r\nHis writings show him undisguisedly vain. After the assassination of the\r\ngreat Julius (B.C. 44), he became the leader of the republican party,\r\nand in his celebrated “Philippics” denounced Antony as the foe of his\r\ncountry. This was his ruin. On the formation of the Triumvirate of\r\nAntony, Octavius, and Lepidus, he was included in the proscriptions; his\r\nhead was cut off, and fixed upon the Rostra which had so frequently\r\nresounded with his eloquence. His greatest political achievement was the\r\ndetection and sudden overthrow of the revolutionary conspiracy headed by\r\nCatiline (B.C. 63), his brilliant denunciations of whom we listen to in\r\nour boyhood. Kind and pure in his life, but without true greatness of\r\ncharacter, and with many moral weaknesses.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Vatican. Considered to be the most faithful\r\n  portrait of this renowned orator. No. 120A is from the Gallery of\r\n  Philosophers of the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n120A. CICERO--MARCUS TULLIUS. _Roman Orator._\r\n\r\n121. VIRGIL--PUBLIUS VIRGILIUS MARO. _Latin Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Andes, near Mantua, in Cisalpine Gaul, B.C. 70. Died at\r\n  Brundusium, in Italy, B.C. 19. Aged 51.]\r\n\r\nThe district in which Virgil was born not being then included in Italy,\r\nhe did not enjoy the native rights of a Roman citizen; and when Augustus\r\ndivided the lands in Cisalpine Gaul amongst his victorious veteran\r\nsoldiers, Virgil was ejected from his small patrimonial farm. Upon his\r\npetitioning the emperor, however, the farm was restored to him. He was\r\nthe friend of Horace, whom he introduced to Mæcenas. Besides poetry, he\r\ncultivated medicine and agriculture. He was tall, dark, rustic in\r\nappearance, and feeble in body. He was drawn by the power of genius from\r\nthe obscure shade of a peasant’s life, to be the favoured poet and\r\nfriend of an emperor. In his verse the native majesty of the language\r\nappears more perfectly tempered, than in any other, with grace and\r\nsweetness. Virgil is the most pathetic of the Roman poets: the heart\r\nspeaks in his verse. He has the soul of the beautiful, like an earlier\r\nRaffaelle in song. His poem on Husbandry--the most finished work of his\r\nmuse--is written with a cleaving of soul to the native theme. The\r\npurport of the poem was to recall the luxurious Romans to the simple and\r\nvigorous way of life of their ancestors, who lived cultivating the\r\nearth. If the rural earth and free nature could have been endeared to\r\nthe voluptuous masters of the world by the charm of musical words, the\r\nGeorgics might have done this. We ourselves feel the pouring of a purer\r\natmosphere into the corrupted city. The epic poem of Virgil, “The\r\nÆneid,” relating the transplantation of a Trojan colony from the flames\r\nof falling Troy, to found (in Italy) future Rome, derives a high\r\npoetical cast from the prophetic spirit that overshadows it. Both “The\r\nGeorgics” and the “Æneid” express love in the soul of the poet--love for\r\nthe scenes and vocation, in which he was born--love of Rome, which he\r\nwill purify or will glorify.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Stanza dei Filosofi of the Capitol, at Rome.\r\n  The portraits of Virgil have been verified by Bellori. The tomb of\r\n  Virgil is a well-known object of interest near Naples. It is now an\r\n  ivy-grown, but venerated ruin, although so late as 1326 it was nearly\r\n  perfect.]\r\n\r\n122. SENECA--LUCIUS ANNÆUS. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Corduba (Cordova), in Spain, about A.D. 2. Died at Rome, A.D.\r\n  68. Aged 66.]\r\n\r\nThe tutor of young Domitius, afterwards the Emperor Nero, by whom he was\r\ncondemned and sentenced to self-destruction---probably that Nero might\r\nsecure his great possessions. Seneca underwent his punishment with great\r\nfirmness and philosophic calm. He was a writer of many works, and\r\nQuintilian says that he corrupted the taste of his age by an affected\r\nthough elegant style. Many of his epistles and moral and physical\r\ntreatises are extant. His philosophy was Stoical, with modifications;\r\nhis manner of writing is antithetical, and apparently laboured. He\r\nrejected the superstitions of his country, and was a monotheist.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Berlin Museum. In the Florence collection\r\n  there are three Busts of him. The portrait of Seneca was identified as\r\n  early as the sixteenth century by a medallion engraved with his name,\r\n  possessed by Cardinal Mattei. A Bust in bronze was found at\r\n  Herculaneum.]\r\n\r\n122*. LIVY--TITUS LIVIUS. _Roman Historian._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Petavium (Padua), B.C. 59. Died A.D. 17. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the life of this famous historian, save that he\r\nenjoyed the patronage and friendship of Augustus, and established a wide\r\nand instantaneous fame in his own time. The great and only extant work\r\nof Livy is his History of Rome. It originally consisted of 142 books: 35\r\nonly have come down to us--of the remainder we have merely short\r\nsummaries. Livy is an admirable weaver together, without sifting\r\ncriticism, of received records and traditions. His reader glides on the\r\nstream of his flowing narration. His style is lucid, animated,\r\npicturesque. But in the annals of the warlike republic--that setter up\r\nand putter down of kings--that mistress of the nations--we look for and\r\ndesire, more stern and majestic strength;--a profounder disclosure of\r\nthe heroic political wisdom, which steadily advanced in building up the\r\nmost memorable empire in the world.\r\n\r\n  [Bust yet to come.]\r\n\r\n(_Leaving the Court of Roman Generals, we proceed to the Nave.

DECIMUS CŒLIUS BALBINUS. _Roman Statesman and Emperor_, A.D. 238.\r\n\r\n  [Date, and place of birth unknown.]\r\n\r\nA man of Consular dignity, who had governed in nearly all the peaceful\r\nprovinces of the Empire, and was esteemed and beloved by all ranks;\r\nwhen, upon the death of the Gordiani in Africa, he was selected as one\r\nof the Emperors to oppose the ferocious Maximinus--Pupienus being the\r\nother. Soon after the death of Maximinus, both Balbinus and Pupienus\r\nwere murdered by the Prætorians, who remembered to their disadvantage\r\nthe prodigal liberality of their lately-slain tyrant. They reigned only\r\nfour months. Balbinus was celebrated for his oratory and poetry.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Capitoline Museum, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nOur Italian collection is formed, chiefly, from the busts of the\r\nCapitoline Museum, at Rome, where Pius VII., in 1820, founded a portrait\r\ngallery of celebrated Italians, to which he gave the name of the\r\nProtomoteca. This gallery contains about 70 busts, and though dedicated\r\nespecially to the honour of Italians, still finds room for some of the\r\ndistinguished foreigners who derived much of their eminence from\r\nstudying at Rome. These are Nicolas Poussin of France, Raffaelle Mengs\r\nthe Bohemian, Winckelmann the German antiquary, Angelica Kauffman, the\r\nmost accomplished painter of her sex, and Giuseppe Suée, a French\r\npainter. The busts of living men are not admitted, and the honour of\r\njoining the famous company is awarded by the Academy of Rome, assisted\r\nby men learned or skilled in any special science or art.\r\n\r\nThe series is a very complete one, and begins as early as the XIIIth\r\ncentury. It is to be regretted that so few of these busts have been done\r\nfrom the life; although it must be understood that none is the work of\r\nmere imagination, some authenticated portrait having in every case\r\nfurnished a model. Most of these busts are the work of sculptors of the\r\ntime of Canova, and many of them were executed at his expense, and\r\npresented to the collection. In general, it will be remarked that a\r\ncertain grandeur prevails in the treatment of the heads, an element that\r\nseems to belong, naturally, to the works of the best Italian artists,\r\nwhether in painting or sculpture. Even where existing casts from the\r\nface prove to us that in these busts there has been a certain departure\r\nfrom the real features, we see it has been done only to afford a more\r\nexalted idea of the person, and to give the stamp of that nobleness and\r\ndignity which characterize the finest efforts of portraiture. A\r\ncomparison of the busts of Galileo, Nos. 185 and 185A, and of Michael\r\nAngelo, Nos. 143 and 143A, will illustrate this point.\r\n\r\nThere is also in the Capitoline Museum, a large collection of antique\r\nportrait busts, embracing many of the ancient philosophers, poets, and\r\nRoman Emperors, a selection from which, as we have already stated, is\r\nfound in the Greek and Roman Courts.\r\n\r\nIn the Vatican (the palace of the Pope, at Rome), a splendid edifice,\r\nwhich has, from time to time, been constructed and enlarged by various\r\neminent architects, and decorated by the greatest painters of the world,\r\nare preserved many _chefs d’œuvre_ of art that are to be seen in no\r\nother place. The collection of the Vatican includes many portraits of\r\nevery kind; but one portion of the vast structure is exclusively devoted\r\nto portrait-statues and busts. This is a spacious and magnificent\r\napartment called the Rotonda, paved with antique mosaics, and surrounded\r\nwith antique statues and busts on pedestals of the rarest marbles.\r\nAdjoining this saloon is another noble gallery, built by Pius VII. which\r\ncontains many statues of the Greek sages, and of other illustrious men.\r\n\r\nIn the Florence gallery there is a most interesting series of portraits\r\nof painters by their own hands--a unique and unrivalled collection,\r\nbegun by the Cardinal Leopold, the brother of Ferdinand II., and\r\nincreased by the addition of the portraits from the collection of the\r\nAbbé Pazzi, purchased by the Grand Duke Leopold in 1765. Besides these\r\npaintings, there is a collection of more than 4,000 engraved gems and\r\ncameos, amongst which are many antique portraits. There are also about\r\n100 antique portrait busts, of which the rarest and best preserved are\r\nCicero, Marc Antony, Julius Cæsar, Augustus, Caligula, Galba, and Otho.\r\nAs the visitor will observe, several of these are in our portrait\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nThe Naples collection, besides many fine works of antiquity of every\r\nkind, has contributed in the most important manner to the subject of\r\nantique portraiture. It contains the invaluable relics found at\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii: and amongst these have, from time to time,\r\nappeared portrait busts, statues, and even pictures with names upon\r\nthem, by which busts elsewhere have been recognised. There are in this\r\nMuseum, about 200 portraits in marble and bronze, from which our\r\ncollection has been enriched.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(_The portraits of Italians begin immediately behind the Statue of\r\nRubens, in the great Transept, on the east side of the Nave._)\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISTS AND MUSICIANS.\r\n\r\n129. NICCOLA PISANO. _Sculptor and Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Pisa, in Italy, 1205-7. Died at Sienna, in Italy, about\r\n  1290.]\r\n\r\nThe early reviver of Sculpture in Italy; memorable for being the first\r\nItalian artist who quitted the dry, stiff, traditional forms which had\r\nlong prevailed, and founded a school based upon Truth and Nature. His\r\nfinest productions preceded those of Cimabue; and it was said of him\r\nthat “he was the first to see the light and to follow it.” His great\r\nwork is the marble pulpit, with bas-reliefs from Scripture, in the\r\nBaptistery at Pisa.\r\n\r\n  [By Alessandro d’Este. Vasari mentions a Bust of him by his son\r\n  Giovanni, from which this may have been taken.]\r\n\r\n130. ANDREA DI CIONE, better known by his surname ORCAGNA or ORGAGNA.\r\n_Painter, Sculptor, Architect._\r\n\r\n  [14th century.]\r\n\r\nPrecise time of his birth unknown; it appears that he died about 1370.\r\nExecuted several works in his three vocations. The dignified grandeur\r\nand admirable grouping of the figures in his paintings were at a later\r\nperiod copied or adopted, even by Michael Angelo and Raffaelle. Orcagna\r\nwas a good as well as a great man. His chief works still exist, though\r\nin a half-ruined state, in the Campo Santo at Pisa, and in the Strozzi\r\nChapel, and the Or-San-Michele at Florence.\r\n\r\n  [This Bust is by the Cav. Massimiliano Laboureur. There is, however, a\r\n  mezzo-relievo, by his own hand, behind the altar in Or-San-Michele, at\r\n  Florence, which contains his portrait. He is there represented as an\r\n  Apostle, shaven, and wearing a hood.]\r\n\r\n131. FILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI. _Sculptor and Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Florence, 1377. Died there, 1446. Aged 69.]\r\n\r\nThe self-taught constructor of the Cupola of Santa Maria del Fiore, at\r\nFlorence, which, though smaller than that of St. Peter’s at Rome,\r\nsurpasses it in elegance and lightness. A builder of churches, palaces,\r\nand fortifications. Michael Angelo declared that it was difficult to\r\nimitate and impossible to excel him. Small and insignificant in person,\r\nbut of commanding genius. With many competitors, his goodness and\r\nprudence preserved him from enmity.\r\n\r\n  [His tomb is next to that of Giotto, in the Cathedral at Florence, and\r\n  bears an epitaph by Aretino. This bust was done by Alessandro d’Este.\r\n  It is no doubt taken from that in the Church of Sta. Maria del Fiore,\r\n  at Florence, which was done from the life, in marble, by his pupil, Il\r\n  Buggiano. In 1830, statues of him and Arnolfo, his fellow architect,\r\n  were placed in the new chapter-house: they are by Luigi Pompaloni, a\r\n  Florentine.]\r\n\r\n132. LORENZO GHIBERTI, or LORENZO DI CIONE. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Florence, 1378. Died, 1455. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most memorable of the great Italian artists of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. At the age of 23, he competed with Brunelleschi and Donatello\r\nfor the execution of the side doors of San Giovanni at Florence. His two\r\nrivals confessed themselves vanquished and retired in his favour. These\r\ngates were twenty-one years in course of completion, and are divided\r\ninto 20 panels, each containing a bas-relief cast in bronze, from a\r\nsubject in the New Testament. Another twenty years were spent in\r\nproducing the central doors of the same Baptistery, representing in ten\r\ncompartments the principal events of the Old Testament. Of these,\r\nMichael Angelo said they were beautiful enough to stand at the entrance\r\nof Paradise. A reproduction of these gates occupies the centre of the\r\nsouth end of the Renaissance Court. Ghiberti modelled and cast statues,\r\nworked in gold, painted on glass, and wrote a MS. history of Ancient and\r\nModern Artists.\r\n\r\n  [Buried in Sta. Croce, Florence; his tomb is now lost. This Bust is by\r\n  Carlo Finelli. There is an interesting portrait of him by his own\r\n  hand, amongst the heads on his celebrated gates in the Renaissance\r\n  Court. The two heads in the centre, between the upper corners of the\r\n  second panels from the ground, are portraits of Ghiberti and\r\n  Bartoluccio, the caster; the right-hand one, with the bald head, being\r\n  Ghiberti. In the original gates his name is inscribed near the head,\r\n  with the words,--\r\n\r\n    “Laurentii Cionis de Ghibertis mirâ arte fabricatum.”]\r\n\r\n133. DONATO DI NICCOLO DI BETTO BARDI; called by his contemporaries\r\nDONATELLO. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Florence, 1386. Died there, 1468. Aged 83.]\r\n\r\nHe was the generous competitor and friend of Lorenzo Ghiberti. Employed\r\nand patronized by Cosmo de’ Medici. Was one of the first Italian\r\nsculptors who gave to their figures freedom of movement and force of\r\nexpression. A very fine work of this artist is the equestrian statue of\r\nGattamelata, in the city of Padua. A cast from it will be found in the\r\nGothic and Renaissance Sculpture Court. The character of Donatello was\r\nremarkable for simplicity and generosity; he took no thought for\r\nhimself, and was devoted wholly to his art.\r\n\r\n  [This Bust is by Giovanni Ceccarini.]\r\n\r\n134. FRA ANGELICO DA FIESOLE; called also FRA GIOVANNI DA FIESOLE, and\r\nIL BEATO. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Vicchio, in Tuscany, 1387. Died at Rome, 1455. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nThis charming painter of the early Florentine school became, when a\r\nyouth, a friar of the Dominican order. Began by illuminating missals;\r\nafterwards enlarged his style, and executed frescos. The finest of these\r\nare in the church of San. Marco, and in the chapel of Nicholas V. at\r\nRome. His works are distinguished by simple grace, tenderness of colour,\r\nand the most profound religious feeling. He excelled particularly in\r\npainting angels.\r\n\r\n  [This Bust is by Leandro Biglioschi; but there is a life-size bust of\r\n  him upon his tomb, in Minerva di Roma.]\r\n\r\n135. TOMMASO GUIDI, also called MASSACCIO. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at San-Giovanni, in the Val d’ Arno, 1402. Died at Florence,\r\n  1443. Aged 41.]\r\n\r\nMassaccio-Tomasaccio (big or heavy Tom) was a nickname given to him when\r\na boy. A devoted student of the works of Brunelleschi and Donatello. He\r\nlived for the most part in Rome and Florence, and died in the last-named\r\ncity. Time has destroyed the greater number of his works. His frescos,\r\nwhich still remain in the Brancacci chapel of the Carmelite church in\r\nFlorence, representing the history of St. Peter, are remarkable for\r\ntheir freedom, and for the absence of the conventionalities of the early\r\nmediæval painters. Some of his noble figures became models for the later\r\nFlorentines, and were imitated by Raffaelle himself. He excelled his\r\ncontemporaries in the nude form, and gave to his draperies a style\r\nunknown before, adapting them naturally and gracefully to the human\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n  [By Carlo Finelli.]\r\n\r\n136. ANDREA MANTEGNA. _Painter and Engraver._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Padua, in Italy, 1430. Died at Mantua, in Italy, 1506. Aged\r\n  76.]\r\n\r\nThis painter is celebrated among the early artists of Italy, and belongs\r\nto the Paduan school of art. His _chef-d’œuvre_, the _Madonna della\r\nVittoria_, in the Louvre, is grandly treated, and remarkable for its\r\nadmirable finish. His cartoons of the triumphs of Cæsar are at Hampton\r\nCourt; the composition is grand and spirited, and knowledge of the\r\nantique is blended with a feeling for nature. To Mantegna is attributed\r\nthe art of engraving with the burin, and also the invention of the art\r\nof foreshortening figures, especially on ceilings. Distinguished for his\r\ngood and amiable qualities.\r\n\r\n  [He was buried in the Church of S. Agnese, in Mantua. His tomb is in\r\n  one of the chapels, and bears his statue, in bronze. This bust is by\r\n  Rainaldo Rinaldi.]\r\n\r\n137. LUCA SIGNORELLI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cortona, in Tuscany, 1440. Died 1521. Aged 81.]\r\n\r\nAn ancestor of Vasari, the author of “Lives of the Painters,” and a\r\ndistinguished painter of the early Tuscan school. Assisted in the works\r\nof the Sistine Chapel at Rome; and his pictures there, according to\r\nVasari, are superior to those of his contemporaries. His great frescos\r\nin the Cathedral of Orvieto, representing the Day of Judgment and the\r\nHistory of Antichrist, are his principal works. His productions show too\r\ngreat anxiety to mark the form with anatomical correctness. In this he\r\nwas the precursor of Michael Angelo; and Fuseli has frequently imitated\r\nhim. As a man he was upright, sincere, and kind-hearted. He lived and\r\ndecorated himself with great splendour.\r\n\r\n  [By Pietro Pierantoni.]\r\n\r\n138. FRANCESCO LAZZARI BRAMANTE. _Architect, Painter, Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Castel Durante, in Italy, 1444. Died at Rome, 1514. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nMemorable as the architect employed by Julius II. and Leo X. to rebuild\r\nthe church of St. Peter’s, at Rome, and to construct the famous Loggie\r\nof the Vatican, afterwards completed and adorned by Raffaelle. Bramante\r\nwas a bold and original genius, but vain, impetuous, and impatient. As a\r\nconsequence of his recklessness, most of his works have speedily\r\ndecayed.\r\n\r\n  [By Alessandro d’Este. Bramante was buried in the crypt of S. Peter’s,\r\n  at Rome, called the “Grotte Vaticane.”]\r\n\r\n139. PIETRO PERUGINO, or PIETRO VANUCCI DELLA PIEVE. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Pieve, in Italy, 1446. Died there or at Perugia, 1524. Aged\r\n  78.]\r\n\r\nImmortal as the instructor of Raffaelle, and himself a celebrated\r\npainter of the Umbrian school. He was opposed to the more modern style\r\nof which Michael Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and his own great pupil\r\nRaffaelle, are the renowned masters. His pictures are religious,\r\nearnest, and graceful, but wanting in variety of character. In his best\r\npictures, his colouring is excellent, and the expression of his heads\r\nvery beautiful, but his numerous works are of very unequal value and\r\nmerit. Vasari has branded this painter as avaricious, eccentric, sordid,\r\nand irreligious. Modern writers have attempted to rescue him from the\r\nharsh verdict pronounced by his early biographer.\r\n\r\n  [By Raimondo Trentanove.]\r\n\r\n140. DOMENICO GHIRLANDAIO. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Florence, 1449--51. Died sometime between 1490 and 1498.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a goldsmith who adopted the name Ghirlandaio (the\r\ngarland-maker) on account of his skill in making the gold and silver\r\nornaments worn by Florentine girls. The first work of Domenico was a\r\nportrait of Amerigo Vespucci who had the honour of giving his name to\r\nAmerica. Devoted to his art, preferring honour and glory to riches.\r\nPainted in fresco, in tempera, and in mosaic, but excelled in the first.\r\nIn his sacred historical pictures, he introduced portraits of remarkable\r\npersons as spectators, which gives them a peculiar value. He was the\r\nearly instructor of Michael Angelo, and his finest works are in the\r\nchurches of Florence.\r\n\r\n  [By Massimiliano Laboureur. His portrait, by his own hand, is in one\r\n  of the pictures of the Choir of S. Maria Novella, at Florence.]\r\n\r\n141. LEONARDO DA VINCI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Vinci, in Tuscany, 1452. Died at Amboise, in France, 1519.\r\n  Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest names of the fifteenth century. His genius was all\r\nbut universal, and his faculty of acquiring knowledge of all kinds,\r\nprodigious. He is most generally known and appreciated as a painter; but\r\nhe was also a distinguished writer, a man of general science, an\r\narchitect, an engineer, an accomplished musician, and a discoverer in\r\nNatural Philosophy. As painter he was the pupil of Andrea Verrochio, and\r\nthe founder of the Milan school. It was at Milan that he painted his\r\ngreat and universally known picture, of the “Last Supper.” From 1504 to\r\n1515, he travelled through Italy as architect and engineer to Cæsar\r\nBorgia, Duke of Valentino. He is the undoubted head of the highest\r\ndevelopment of art, in which the most elevated subjects were represented\r\nin the noblest Form. Every branch and attribute of Fine Art was\r\nintimately known to him. In the expression of the passions, his eye and\r\nmind were quick and eager; and he investigated every phase of life to\r\nits minutest modifications. He was familiar with the spirit of the\r\nhumblest ranks, and could stamp divine subjects with a beauty and\r\nsentiment which only the very highest genius is competent to attain.\r\nThere was great rivalry between Leonardo and Michael Angelo.--A Titanic\r\nemulation! The faculties of both were mighty and analogous; their grasp\r\nsimilarly broad and powerful. Leonardo passed his last years in France,\r\nprotected by Francis I., who showered favours upon this gifted man. A\r\nstory is current that the painter died in the arms of the monarch, but\r\nthere appears no good foundation for the statement.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble, by Filippo Albaccini. The bust resembles the painted\r\n  portraits, of which there are several of undoubted accuracy and truth,\r\n  painted by himself, at Florence, Venice, Paris, and Milan. The works\r\n  of Leonardo on Anatomy and Painting are still invaluable to students\r\n  in art. His treatise on Painting was first printed at Paris in 1651.\r\n  The MS. was in a curious hand-writing, and written backwards with the\r\n  left hand.]\r\n\r\n142. FRA BARTOLOMEO, or BACCIO DELLA PORTA. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Savignano, in Italy, 1469. Died 1517. Aged 49.]\r\n\r\nAt an early age he carefully studied the works of Leonardo da Vinci, and\r\nthe effect of the study is visible in his own productions. Whilst his\r\nfame was growing, he became deeply influenced by the preaching of\r\nSavonarola, at whose instigation he publicly burnt some of his finest\r\nstudies of the undraped figure. In 1500, Bartolomeo assumed the habit of\r\na Dominican friar, and forsook painting. But after the lapse of four\r\nyears he resumed his art, made the acquaintance of Raffaelle at\r\nFlorence, and the influence of these two eminent painters on each other\r\nwas mutually advantageous. Among the finest works of Fra Bartolomeo are,\r\nthe large picture of St. Mark, esteemed in painting equal to the “Moses”\r\nof Michael Angelo in sculpture, and the “Madonna della Misericordia.” He\r\nwas the inventor of the lay figure, which he was the first to employ.\r\nHis style is characterized by calm seriousness, unaffected dignity, and\r\ngrace. The religious expression of his holy figures reveals conscious\r\nelevation, not mere sentimentality; and in his Madonnas holiness is\r\nalways exquisitely blended with beauty. But Bartolomeo lacked inward\r\npower. Sometimes he is cold and formal; at others, impetuous and wanting\r\nin repose. The colouring of flesh is peculiarly soft in his pictures,\r\nand his draperies are excellent.\r\n\r\n  [By Domenico Manera. In the last work of Bartolomeo, which is now in\r\n  the Uffizzi, at Florence, representing the patron saints of Florence,\r\n  and others, he has introduced his own portrait.]\r\n\r\n143. MICHAEL ANGELO BUONAROTTI. _Sculptor, Painter, Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Caprese, in Tuscany, 1474. Died at Rome, 1563. Aged 89.]\r\n\r\nA demigod in art. All learning and all knowledge came to Michael Angelo,\r\nperhaps even more than to Leonardo da Vinci, his mighty contemporary, as\r\na rightful inheritance, to be magnificently accepted and sumptuously\r\nenjoyed. Poet, musician, sculptor, architect, engineer, painter,\r\nanatomist, man of science--his titles to renown are inexhaustible. His\r\ngenius was universal, his grasp boundless. All his works, of whatever\r\nkind, bear the broad, deep stamp of his haughty, masculine spirit, and\r\nconstitute the immortal expression of strength, energy, and sublimest\r\npassion. The feeling of Michael Angelo was strong, intense, grand,\r\npenetrating; his thought as clear as it was profound. His life is a\r\nseries of conquests in the world of intellect. Domenico Ghirlandaio has\r\nthe honour of claiming Buonarotti for his pupil. By Ghirlandaio the\r\nstripling was introduced to Lorenzo de’ Medici, who, as well as his\r\nsuccessor, became the steady friend of the great artist. Upon the\r\nexpulsion of the Medici, he went to Bologna, thence to Florence, and\r\nthence again, upon the invitation of the Pope, to Rome. In 1503,\r\ncommissioned to paint one end of the great Hall of Council, Leonardo da\r\nVinci being intrusted with the other. Never before had two such spirits\r\nmet to contend for glory. His statue of Moses, and the ceiling of the\r\nSistine Chapel, were produced under Pope Julius II. Under Leo X., and\r\nAdrian, works of equal power issued from his inspired brain. In 1546, he\r\nwas commanded by the Pope to undertake the direction of the works at St.\r\nPeter’s. He consented only upon condition that he received no salary,\r\nand laboured “for the love of God alone.” For seventeen years he\r\nprosecuted the pious service, and raised the sacred edifice as far as\r\nthe base of the cupola. The undying memorials of his chisel and pencil\r\nspeak the intellectual supremacy of the man beyond all words of praise.\r\nThey will command wonder, delight, admiration, respect, and awe, whilst\r\nthe world lasts. There is nothing factitious, no studied allurement, no\r\nimposture in his work. It is all true, simple, sublime. Michael Angelo,\r\nin 1530, directed in person the defence of Florence, and erected its\r\nfortifications--which yet exist--when that city was besieged, and, after\r\na year of heroic defence, taken by the army of Charles V. The fall of\r\nFlorence, at this time, witnessed the last breath of Italian\r\nindependence. Look on his face! You see many furrowed lines there, and a\r\npotent brow. The features and expression betray irascibility of temper,\r\njealous self-consciousness, towering sense of power. Michael Angelo had\r\nall these. He was a lion aware of his strength. What if he used it as a\r\nlion, at times vehemently, and regardless of the pain inflicted upon\r\nothers! He was also a staunch friend, disinterested, liberal, temperate,\r\nupright, conscientious. The ancients had their Titans. Michael Angelo\r\ntoo is the son of Heaven and Earth.\r\n\r\n  [This Bust is from the marble by Alessandro d’Este, and one of those\r\n  contributed to the Capitoline Museum, at the expense of Canova, when\r\n  he was President of the Academy of Saint Luke, at Rome. It conveys an\r\n  idea of coarseness which would hardly seem to belong to Michael\r\n  Angelo’s natural expression, marked as it is with power and energy. It\r\n  will be remembered how his nose was broken by a blow from his\r\n  fellow-student, Torrigiano. He was buried in Sta. Croce, at Florence,\r\n  his noble monument there being designed and executed under the\r\n  superintendence of Vasari, the historian of the painters. It consists\r\n  of a sarcophagus, supported by three figures, representing Painting,\r\n  Sculpture, and Architecture, and surmounted by his bust (of which No.\r\n  143A is a cast) and three crowns, with the motto “tergeminis tollit\r\n  honoribus.” This tomb and the bust were executed by three sculptors,\r\n  Domenico Lorenzi, a pupil of Bandinelli, Valerio Cioli, and Giovanni\r\n  dell’ Opera. There is, in the Capitoline Museum a bust of Michael\r\n  Angelo, said to be by his own hand; the head is of bronze, and the\r\n  rest of marble; and in the same place a painted portrait of him, by\r\n  Andrea del Sarto. Vasari mentions an alto-relievo of him in bronze, by\r\n  Danielo Ricciarelli, and a medal (“a very close resemblance”) by Cav.\r\n  Lioni, which was abundantly copied and distributed in his honour.]\r\n\r\n143A. MICHAEL ANGELO BUONAROTTI. _Sculptor, Painter, Architect._\r\n\r\n144. TITIAN, or, TIZIANO VECELLIO. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Pieve di Cadore, in Lombardy, 1477. Died at Venice, 1576.\r\n  Aged 99.]\r\n\r\nIn the works of Titian, Venetian art reached its culminating point. He\r\nwas the pupil of Bellini; but the disciple soon surpassed his master.\r\nTitian first instituted the custom of painting full-length portraits,\r\nand his pictures of this kind, of which he painted many, have never been\r\nsurpassed. In the representation of undraped female forms he also\r\ndisplayed the hand of a master. In softness, transparency, and delicacy\r\nof colouring, he stands alone. All his figures seem to express a high\r\nconsciousness and enjoyment of existence. He was followed, throughout\r\nhis career, with great honours. Charles V., whose portrait he painted,\r\nmade him Count Palatine, and he received invitations from other crowned\r\nheads. He died of the plague in Venice, and was buried with great\r\nceremony, at a time when raging pestilence had suspended the ordinary\r\nrites of burial. Towards the close of his life his subjects were chiefly\r\nreligious.\r\n\r\n  [He was buried at the Chiesa delle Frazi, at Venice. This Bust is by\r\n  Alessandro d’Este. There is in the Church of St. John and St. Paul, at\r\n  Venice, a fine bust of Titian, which stands by the side of that of\r\n  Palma Vecchio; it was placed there forty-five years after his death,\r\n  by Palma il Giovine. There is little doubt that this and its companion\r\n  of Palma were the work of Jacops Albarelli, the intimate friend of\r\n  Palma Giovine, whose bust he also executed. Ridolfi mentions a Bust\r\n  of the great painter, by his friend Jacopo Sansovino. There is, in the\r\n  Vienna Gallery, a superb portrait of him, by his own hand.]\r\n\r\n145. BENVENUTO TISIO, commonly called GAROFALO. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Garofalo, 1481. Died at Ferrara, in Italy, 1559. Aged 78.]\r\n\r\nA distinguished painter of the Ferrarese school. The sight of\r\nRaffaelle’s works, in the Sistine Chapel, determined him to follow art,\r\nand he became a friend of the great artist himself, though in style most\r\nunlike him--brilliant but mannered. On festival days it was his custom\r\nto work without payment at a convent in Ferrara, “for the love of God.”\r\nBlind for the last few years of his life--cheerful in disposition, and\r\nresigned under affliction.\r\n\r\n  [By Massimiliano Laboureur. In the Louvre are two portraits said to be\r\n  of Garofalo, but they are of doubtful authenticity. This bust is\r\n  probably done from a picture.]\r\n\r\n146. RAFFAELLE SANZIO, commonly called RAFFAELLE. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Urbino, in Italy, 1483. Died at Rome, 1520. Aged 37.]\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Roman school of painting. He was the son of a\r\npainter, and the pupil of Perugino, whom his first style resembles, and\r\nwhom he quickly surpassed. He was already eminent in his art at the age\r\nof seventeen. In 1506, he first saw Michael Angelo’s great and\r\ncelebrated “Cartoon of Pisa,” and a closer study of anatomy and form is\r\nmanifest in his works after this time. In 1508, in the pontificate of\r\nJulius II., he was invited to Rome, where he continued until his death,\r\npainting his exquisite frescos in the Vatican. Whilst executing these\r\nworks, Michael Angelo was completing the Sistine chapel, and a rivalry\r\narose between these two consummate artists, which was never\r\nextinguished. Raffaelle was a sculptor and architect as well as painter.\r\nIn 1514, he directed the works at St. Peter’s, and was subsequently very\r\nzealous in superintending the exhumation of the remains of antique art,\r\nand in designing a restoration of ancient Rome. In the midst of his fine\r\nlabours, he contracted a fever and died. In his works, beauty of Form is\r\nthe expression of the utmost elevation of mind and perfect purity of\r\nsoul. Some of Raffaelle’s cartoons on scriptural subjects are at Hampton\r\nCourt Palace. Several of his pictures are in France, obtained by Francis\r\nI., who tried in vain to allure Raffaelle to his capital. His\r\n“Transfiguration,” in the Vatican, left unfinished at his death, and\r\ncarried in his own funeral procession, is considered by some the finest\r\npicture in the world. It was finished by his pupil, Giulio Romano.\r\nLittle or nothing is known of his private life, save that his nature was\r\nsweet and gracious, and that all men loved him. He was of a slender\r\nframe, and five feet seven inches high. His skull was beautifully\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n  [Raffaelle was buried in the Pantheon at Rome, now called Sta. Maria\r\n  Ritonda. His tomb was ordered by himself, and executed by Lorenzo\r\n  Lotti, who, it is said, restored one of the ancient tabernacles there\r\n  at Raffaelle’s request, and added an altar, with a figure of the\r\n  Virgin. Upon this monument there is a bust of him by Paolo Naldini, a\r\n  sculptor who lived in the early part of the 17th century. The tomb was\r\n  opened in 1833, and the remains were found entire, so that the skull\r\n  long exhibited in the Academy of S. Luke as that of Raffaelle was\r\n  proved to be a fabulous relic. Portraits of Raffaelle are to be found\r\n  in several celebrated pictures; in the Duomo and Sacristy of Siena, in\r\n  the Borghese Gallery at Rome, and one by his own hand in the picture\r\n  of St. Luke; but the most authentic one, and that which alone\r\n  possesses the beautiful expression of his remarkable countenance, is\r\n  the picture by himself in the Gallery of Portraits of Painters by\r\n  their own hands at Florence. This bust is from one probably by Carlo\r\n  Maratta, a great admirer and copier of Raffaelle’s works, and who\r\n  presented it to the Capitoline Museum. There was in 1791, in the Spada\r\n  Palace at Rome, a portrait of Raffaelle when 12 years old, by himself.\r\n  (See “Martyn’s Tour in Italy,” p. 242.)]\r\n\r\n147. MICHELE SANMICHELI. _Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Verona, in Italy, 1484. Died there, 1559. Aged 75.]\r\n\r\nHis works were chiefly fortifications. At the age of seventeen, he went\r\nto Rome to study the remains of its ancient architecture, and there\r\ngained the friendship of Buonarotti, Bramante, Sansovino, and Sangallo.\r\nFor Pope Clement VII. he fortified, with Sangallo, the cities of Parma\r\nand Placentia. In 1527, entered the service of the Venetians, and for\r\nthem, at Verona, first employed angular bastions, which he invented. The\r\nprinciple being generally adopted, Sanmicheli was employed to fortify\r\nmany of the Italian cities, as well as the islands of Candia and Corfu.\r\nHe then strengthened his native city with fortifications, and adorned it\r\nwith palaces and other works. One of these, the Capella di Guareschi, is\r\na masterpiece of architecture.\r\n\r\n  [Bust by Domenico Manera.]\r\n\r\n148. FRA SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO, sometimes called SEBASTIANO VENEZIANO.\r\n_Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Venice, 1485. Died at Rome, 1547. Aged 62.]\r\n\r\nThe pupil of Bellini and Giorgione. At Rome he competed with Raffaelle,\r\nand gained the friendship and approval of Michael Angelo, some of whose\r\ndesigns he executed,--amongst others that of the “Raising of Lazarus”--a\r\npicture now in our National Gallery. Besides painting in oils and\r\nfresco, he invented a method of painting on stone, which was much\r\nadmired. His portraits are celebrated, and he excelled in beauty of\r\ncolouring. It is said that he was slow of execution, and not a lover of\r\nhis art, which he deserted for other pleasures when he attained\r\ncompetency. His principal works are in Venice and Rome. He was called\r\n_Fra del Piombo_ (Monk of the Signet), from the office of sealer of\r\nbriefs, which he held in the Pope’s Chancery.\r\n\r\n  [By Massimiliano Laboureur.]\r\n\r\n149. GIOVANNI DA UDINE, or GIOVANNI DI NANI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Udine, in Italy, 1487. Died at Rome, 1564. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nA pupil of Raffaelle, whose style he so thoroughly imitated that it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish his work from that of his master, whenever he\r\nacted as his assistant. In this capacity he was the chief painter of the\r\nLoggie of the Vatican. Some ancient grottos having been discovered near\r\nRome, he detected the composition of their stucco ornaments; and so\r\nsuccessfully imitated the material, that he may be called the inventor\r\nof modern stucco work. Excelled in painting birds, fruits, and animals.\r\n\r\n  [By Massimiliano Laboureur.]\r\n\r\n150. ANDREA DEL SARTO, or ANDREA VANNUCHI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Florence, 1488. Died there, 1530. Aged 42.]\r\n\r\nCalled Del Sarto, from the trade of his father, who was a tailor. Long\r\ntrouble followed his early and unfortunate marriage. Visited France,\r\nwhere he painted pictures for Francis I., who loaded him with gifts, and\r\ncommissioned him to buy works of art in Florence. Spent the money\r\nentrusted to him, and bought neither pictures nor statues for his\r\nillustrious patron. Disgraced, neglected, and poor, he died deserted by\r\nhis wife. This painter--whose works are admirable in design and colour,\r\nand remarkable for the elegance and majesty of the figures, is deficient\r\nin elevation and refinement of expression. His own character was morally\r\nweak and degraded.\r\n\r\n  [By Antonio D’Este. A monument was erected to him by Raffaelle da\r\n  Monti Lupo at the expense of Domenico Conti, the heir of Andrea, in\r\n  the Church of the Servites. It was removed by the authorities, but in\r\n  1606 a Prior had another tomb erected in the cloister, between the\r\n  Madonna del Sacco and another of his frescos. A life-size bust in\r\n  marble, by Giovanni Caccini, surmounts this tomb.]\r\n\r\n151. MARCANTONIO RAIMONDI. _Engraver._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bologna, in Italy, about 1489. Died there, about 1537.]\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of all the early engravers. The first impression\r\nfrom any engraved metal plate is dated 1454. Within sixty years,\r\nMarcantonio had carried the art to perfection. At Rome he was patronized\r\nfor some years by Raffaelle, who employed him to engrave some of his\r\nmost exquisite designs. The finest works of Marcantonio now bear a very\r\nhigh value for their beauty and rarity. Unhappily he was a bad man. He\r\nbegan his career as an artist by using his skill to pirate some of the\r\nworks of Albert Durer. After Raffaelle’s death, he was banished from\r\nRome by Clement VII. for gross immorality, fled to Bologna, fell into\r\npoverty, and is supposed to have died assassinated.\r\n\r\n  [By Massimiliano Laboureur. The best specimens of Marcantonio’s\r\n  engraving are in the Imperial collection at Vienna.]\r\n\r\n152. CORREGGIO, or ANTONIO ALLEGRI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Correggio, in Italy, 1493 or 1494. Died there, 1534. Aged 40\r\n  or 41.]\r\n\r\nOf his private life and character little is known, but his works are\r\njustly admired throughout the civilized world, while his frescos in the\r\ncupola of the Cathedral at Parma have earned for him undying fame. He\r\npainted in oil and fresco. In our National Gallery we have several of\r\nhis admirable productions. As an artist, remarkable for exquisite\r\nsensibility. “In his compositions,” says Kugler, “all is life and\r\nmotion. All his pictures express the overflowing consciousness of life;\r\nthe impulse of love and pleasure.” Delicate in perception, with great\r\nquickness, subtlety, and depth of feeling. His forms not always\r\nbeautiful, but his treatment of light and shade masterly, and almost\r\nunique.\r\n\r\n  [There is no bust of Correggio from the life; this is by Philippo\r\n  Albacini, and no doubt from some authentic painted portrait.]\r\n\r\n153. POLIDORO CALDARE DA CARAVAGGIO. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Caravaggio, in Lombardy, 1495. Died at Messina, 1543. Aged\r\n  48.]\r\n\r\nWas employed by Raffaelle to assist him in the Vatican, having been\r\noriginally a mason. Afterwards became distinguished as an ornamental\r\npainter. He was assassinated by his servant for the sake of his money.\r\n\r\n  [He was buried in the Cathedral at Messina. The Bust is by\r\n  Massimiliano Laboureur.]\r\n\r\n\r\n154. GIULIO ROMANO, or GIULIO PIPPI DE’ GIANNUZZI. _Architect and\r\nPainter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, 1499. Died at Mantua, 1546. Aged 47.]\r\n\r\nA pupil of Raffaelle, by whom he was employed on works at the Vatican.\r\nInvited by the Marquis of Mantua to the city of that name, where he was\r\nraised to the rank of nobility, provided with a house, a salary of 500\r\ngold ducats, board for himself and his pupils, a horse, and some yards\r\nof silk velvet and cloth for clothing. Built many palaces in Mantua, and\r\npainted much in fresco. His later works are wanting in grace and purity,\r\nand display wildness and even coarseness. Yet he has a memorable name as\r\none of the Roman school of art.\r\n\r\n  [This bust is by Alessandro d’Este.]\r\n\r\n155. ANDREA PALLADIO. _Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Vicenza, in Italy, 1518. Died there, 1580. Aged 62.]\r\n\r\nHe largely and accurately studied and described the Roman style of\r\narchitecture, and adapted it to modern purposes with admirable success.\r\nInigo Jones may be called his disciple; and the Banquetting House at\r\nWhitehall is a good example of the style called _Palladian_. He was\r\nsmall in stature, and agreeable in countenance. His most celebrated\r\nbuildings are at Venice, Verona, and Vicenza.\r\n\r\n  [This bust is by Leandro Biglioschi.]\r\n\r\n156. PAOLO CAGLIARI, called VERONESE. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Verona, 1528. Died at Venice, 1588. Aged 60.]\r\n\r\nOne of the great masters of the Venetian school of painting, whose\r\nprinciple was the study and imitation of nature, but whose peculiar\r\nexcellence was colour, which the leaders of the school carried to the\r\nhighest point of perfection. The works of Veronese are remarkable for\r\nsplendour of colour, for the clear and transparent treatment of shadows,\r\nand for comprehensive keeping and harmony. He represented festivals and\r\nbanquets suggested by Sacred History. The “Marriage at Cana,” now in the\r\nLouvre at Paris, is a magnificent example of his style. He was a man of\r\ncourteous manners and generous disposition, and left a family of sons\r\nand brothers, who pursued the same calling.\r\n\r\n  [By Domenico Manera.]\r\n\r\n157. GIOVANNI PIERLUIGI, surnamed DI PALESTRINA. _Musical Composer._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1524. Died 1594. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nPalestrina is justly described in his epitaph as “Musicæ Princeps.” He\r\nwas the greatest musician of his time, and the creator of Church music.\r\nBefore his day the music of profane, and even immoral songs, had been\r\nallied with church masses. He reformed the custom by the production of a\r\nsacred composition that ravished every hearer. In 1555, he was Musical\r\nDirector to the Church of St. John Lateran. Ten years afterwards, he was\r\nnamed Composer to the Pontifical Chapel. But he was in straitened\r\ncircumstances throughout his career. His music continues a model at this\r\nhour. He had a singular capacity for apprehending the poetic character\r\nof his subject.\r\n\r\n158. ANNIBALE CARRACCI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bologna, 1560. Died at Rome, 1609. Aged 49.]\r\n\r\nOne of the three Carracci who founded a new school of painting (the\r\nBolognese school), the fundamental principles of which were the study of\r\nnature, and a close imitation of the great masters. At Rome, painted the\r\ngallery of the Farnese palace with mythological frescos, which display\r\nmasterly drawing, excellent arrangement of draperies, and an agreeable,\r\nclear colouring. Produced landscapes as well as historical works. His\r\nfacility in drawing marvellous. Amongst the pupils of the Carracci\r\nschool were Domenichino, Guercino, and Guido Reni.\r\n\r\n  [The author of this bust is not known. It was executed at the expense\r\n  of Carlo Maratta.]\r\n\r\n159. DOMENICHINO, also called DOMENICO ZAMPIERI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bologna, 1581. Died at Naples, 1641. Aged 60.]\r\n\r\nA famous painter of the Bolognese school. A pupil of the Carracci. At\r\nRome, painted some frescos, and other pictures, but was poorly paid. His\r\nlife one series of misfortunes. His fame and skill excited the jealousy\r\nof the Roman and Neapolitan artists, who destroyed his paintings, mixed\r\ndeleterious compounds with his colours, and--it is believed--at last\r\npoisoned him. His works occasionally reveal artlessness, and a clear\r\nconception of nature, but he never escapes from the trammels of the\r\nimitative school of the Carracci. His great work, the “Communion of St.\r\nJerome,” pronounced by Poussin only inferior to the Transfiguration of\r\nRaffaelle. Yet for this picture, Domenichino received fifty scudi--about\r\nten guineas. In person, stout and short--hence his name, Domenichino\r\n(little Dominic). Passionately fond of music, and devoted to study and\r\ntranquillity. Whilst he painted, he would have his house as quiet and as\r\nnoiseless as a monastery.\r\n\r\n  [By Alessandro d’Este. There is another bust of him in the Louvre by\r\n  Mlle. Charpentier.]\r\n\r\n160. PIETRO DI CORTONA, or PIETRO BERETTINI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cortona, 1596 or 1609. Died at Rome, probably about 1669.]\r\n\r\nA painter of the modern and degenerate school of art, who lived and\r\nworked at Florence and Rome. So stupid in his youth, that he was called\r\n“Ass’s Head.” Was employed to paint a ceiling in the Barberini\r\npalace--perhaps the largest picture ever undertaken by a single artist.\r\nAt Florence he executed the ceilings of the Pitti palace.\r\n\r\n  [This bust is by Pietro Pierantoni.]\r\n\r\n161. ARCANGELO CORELLI. _Violinist and Composer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Fusignano, near Bologna, 1653. Died at Rome, 1713. Aged 60.]\r\n\r\nCorelli’s playing was distinguished by the most perfect sweetness and\r\nsmoothness. Of execution, as now understood, he had none. But he\r\npossessed grace, finish, and an exquisite power of expression. His works\r\nstill keep their ground as an indispensable study for all who would\r\nacquire a broad and artist-like style of playing. He was a modest and\r\nunaffected man, and enjoyed an equable temper, which not even the rough\r\noutbursts of Handel could disconcert. He had also humour. He would lay\r\ndown his violin if folks talked whilst he was playing, and apologize for\r\ninterrupting the conversation.\r\n\r\n  [Corelli was buried in the Pantheon at Rome. The author of this bust\r\n  is not mentioned; it was executed at the cost of Cardinal Ottoboni,\r\n  Corelli’s constant friend and patron.]\r\n\r\n162. LUDOVICO ANTONIO MURATORI. _Antiquary._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Vignola, in Italy, 1672. Died at Modena, in Italy, 1750. Aged\r\n  78.]\r\n\r\nContributed much valuable material towards the History of Italy in the\r\nMiddle Ages. Librarian to the Duke of Modena for the space of fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n  [By Adamo Tadolino.]\r\n\r\n163. BENEDETTO MARCELLO. _Writer and Musician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Venice, 1686. Died at Brescia, in Italy, 1739. Aged 53.]\r\n\r\nA lawyer and public officer; he was also a distinguished poet, and a\r\nmusical composer of a high order. His most celebrated work is a\r\nParaphrase of the first fifty Psalms, arranged for one, two, three, or\r\nfour voices; it is remarkable for great tenderness, united with the\r\nreligious feeling, and vehemence of style, which have obtained for the\r\nauthor from his fond countrymen the appellation of the Pindar and\r\nMichael Angelo of musicians. He also composed sonnets, madrigals, and\r\ndramatic pieces.\r\n\r\n  [By Domenico Manera.]\r\n\r\n164. GIAMBATISTA PIRANESI. _Engraver._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, 1707. Died there, 1778. Aged 71.]\r\n\r\nAn excellent and laborious artist. Has produced a great work in sixteen\r\nvolumes upon the antiquities and curiosities of Rome. Has never been\r\nsurpassed for his skill in representing architectural ruins and\r\nrestorations. He also displays singular powers of invention, and his\r\nfancy subjects show consummate execution. He acquired great and widely\r\nextended fame during his life.\r\n\r\n  [By Antonio d’Este.]\r\n\r\n165. GIOVANNI PAISIELLO. _Musical Composer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Tarento, in Italy, 1741. Died at Naples, 1816. Aged 75.]\r\n\r\nA dramatic composer of extraordinary fertility. His works remarkable for\r\ntheir number, rather than for their eminence. He was the son of a\r\nveterinary surgeon. In 1777, he came to St. Petersburgh, upon the\r\ninvitation of Queen Catharine, and remained there, in great honour,\r\nduring eight years. In 1802, he answered Napoleon’s summons to Paris,\r\nand composed the mass and other music for the coronation, in 1804.\r\nShortly after this event, he retired to Naples, where, in consequence of\r\nhis many political tergiversations, he fell into disgrace, and closed a\r\nbrilliant career in neglect and chagrin. His character as a man is not\r\npleasing. He was jealous, unscrupulous, mean, and cringing.\r\n\r\n  [By Pietro Pierantoni.]\r\n\r\n166. NICCOLO ZINGARELLI. _Musician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Naples, 1752. Died 1837. Aged 85.]\r\n\r\nThe author of several operas no longer performed. One, his most\r\ncelebrated work, “Romeo and Juliet,” still represented in France and\r\nGermany, and rendered popular in England by Pasta’s personation of\r\nRomeo. The last of the Italian composers for the church. His oratorio of\r\n“The Destruction of Jerusalem,” a noble composition, written in the\r\nclassical style of the old ecclesiastical school. During his later years\r\nhe led the life of a recluse.\r\n\r\n167. DOMENICO CIMAROSA. _Musical Composer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Aversa, near Naples, 1755. Died at Venice, 1801. Aged 47.]\r\n\r\nA cobbler’s son and a baker’s apprentice. It was the duty of the lad to\r\nfetch daily a batch of dough from the house of Aprili, the great singing\r\nmaster of his time: and the musical sounds always ringing through the\r\nhouse touched his spirit and elicited his genius. Aprili caught him\r\nlistening at the keyholes, and considerately sent him to a free musical\r\nschool in Naples. At the age of 19, Cimarosa quitted the Conservatorio,\r\nand immediately afterwards wrote his first work--the music to a farce\r\ncalled “Baroness Stramba.” From this time forward his compositions for\r\nthe theatre were incessant, and invariably successful. In 1787,\r\nCatharine of Russia invited him to St. Petersburgh, whither he went; but\r\nhis health failing, he betook him, in 1792, to Vienna, and there entered\r\nthe service of the Emperor Leopold. In his 38th year, after he had\r\nwritten 70 operas and dramatic works, he composed his masterpiece, “Il\r\nMatrimonio Segreto.” The Emperor of Austria was so delighted with the\r\nperformance, that after supping the composer and the singers, he took\r\nthe whole of them back to the theatre, and made them sing the opera\r\nthrough again. The operas of Mozart, then dying a few miles off, had\r\nfallen at the same theatre upon cold and unfeeling ears. Few\r\ncompositions of Cimarosa are known at the present day, though his\r\ninnumerable productions were highly popular whilst he lived. His music\r\nexhibits some originality and a prodigal flow and variety of ideas. His\r\nscoring is peculiarly brilliant, and his comic powers were great.\r\n\r\n  [By Canova.]\r\n\r\n168. ANTONIO CANOVA. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Passagno, in Upper Italy, 1757. Died at Venice, 1822. Aged\r\n  65.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated of modern sculptors. When five years old,\r\nevinced a taste for his art, and at fourteen was a pupil of Tonetto, a\r\nsculptor at Venice. From Venice went to Rome, where he executed many\r\nworks. A favourite of Buonaparte, whose portrait, for the colossal\r\nstatue of the Emperor (in the possession of the Duke of Wellington) he\r\nmodelled at Paris, and from which was taken the bust No.      . He had\r\nno pupils; for he used to say that “the master’s compositions were the\r\nbest instructors.” His works are very numerous; casts from some of the\r\nmost celebrated are to be found in the court of modern Italian\r\nSculpture. His imaginative pieces more successful than his portraits,\r\nalthough many of these are master-pieces of art. In execution he was\r\nunrivalled; but his taste is not always pure. In person Canova was below\r\nthe middle height, his eyes full of expression, and the general\r\ncharacter of his face indicative of good-nature. He was much beloved at\r\nRome as the generous friend of his brother artists.\r\n\r\n  [From the colossal marble bust by his own hand, in the Protomoteca of\r\n  the Capitol at Rome.]\r\n\r\n169. GASPARO SPONTINI. _Musician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Majolatti, in the Roman States, 1778. Died there, 1851. Aged\r\n  73.]\r\n\r\nEducated at Naples, and at the early age of seventeen commenced his\r\nmusical career as the composer of an opera, which was rapidly followed\r\nby sixteen more. In 1803, he went to Paris, and continued composing\r\noperas. In 1807, appointed musical Director to the Empress Josephine;\r\nand in 1808, produced with great success his best work, “La Vestale.”\r\nFrom 1810 to 1820, Director of the Italian Opera in Paris. Then invited\r\nto Berlin, where he wrote some more operas, and remained until the death\r\nof the late king in 1840. The greater part of the music composed by\r\nSpontini is forgotten. He was eclipsed by the genius of Rossini, but he\r\nhad remarkable ability as a dramatic composer. His instrumentation was\r\noriginal, and his music abounds in melody.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch, 1827.

Aged 56.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest of modern fiddlers, who performed in the principal cities\r\nof Europe, and acquired more fame and money by playing on one string,\r\nthan any of the brotherhood ever gained on all four.

Died at Manchester, 1836. Aged 28.]\r\n\r\nA wonderfully gifted dramatic genius, too soon cut off by death. In\r\nFrance, England, Germany and Italy, she created enthusiastic admiration,\r\nas much by her histrionic powers, as by her efforts as a songstress. She\r\nwas a child of nature, and as benevolent as she was richly endowed with\r\nintellectual gifts. She made the noblest uses of the earnings of her\r\nindustry, and was beloved by her fellow artists for the unaffected\r\ngoodness of her heart. No actress of her time equalled her for truth and\r\npassion. Whatever art was in her, lay concealed. It never came to view.\r\nHer acting assailed the feelings of men, and took them prisoner. Escape\r\nwas its own punishment.\r\n\r\n  [By Flosi.]\r\n\r\n171A.

From that time until her retirement from the English\r\nstage in 1854, not absent for a single season. Her voice a soprano of\r\ngreat power and of exquisite purity. Her histrionic talents, of the\r\nhighest order, displayed equally in the artless peasant girl, and in the\r\npassionate and revengeful Semiramis. During twenty years she reigned\r\nsupreme as queen of the lyric drama, finding many rivals, but no equal.\r\n\r\n  [By Flosi.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETS AND DRAMATISTS.\r\n\r\n173. DANTE ALIGHIERI. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Florence, 1265. Died at Ravenna, 1321. Aged 56.]\r\n\r\nThe eldest and greatest poet of modern Italy. He was of a noble\r\nFlorentine family. He came into stormy times, and his life was\r\ntempestuous. His native city was then split between the fierce hostile\r\nfactions of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the two great parties that\r\ndistracted Germany and Italy in the middle ages. An _urban_ faction in\r\nFlorence was that of the Blacks and Whites. Dante was a Ghibelline, and\r\na White: a keen partisan, and a distinguished citizen, he shared the\r\npassions and the vicissitudes of his party. Two battles are mentioned in\r\nwhich he gained honour as a soldier. At thirty-five, he was in the\r\nsupreme magistrature of the city. When Charles of Anjou, in passing\r\nthrough Florence, took the part of the Blacks, Dante was amongst the\r\nsufferers. He was condemned to exile, and confiscation of his property:\r\nbut, on a revision of the sentence, to be burned alive. He wandered\r\nlong, in France and in Italy, and rested at last, under the shelter of\r\nGuido Novelli, at Ravenna. He died there. He was once married, but not\r\nhappily. A boyish love for Beatrice Portinari lives, as a sort of\r\nethereal idea, throughout his poetry and life. He wandered and sang. His\r\nmarvellous poem, “The Divine Comedy,” was composed during his long\r\nexile. It at once raised the modern Italian to the rank of a classical\r\ntongue, and the poetry of modern Italy to a height to which it has never\r\nagain soared. The poet relates his journey, as a living man, through the\r\nthree invisible worlds, which receive, as his church teaches, the souls\r\nof other men when released from the body: Hell, Purgatory, Heaven.\r\nThrough Hell and Purgatory he is led by the shade of the poet\r\nVirgil--indeed his beloved leader in their common art. Through Paradise,\r\nhis Beatrice herself, in whom he impersonates Theology, guides him. The\r\nghosts he sees, those under punishment especially, are chiefly his\r\ndeceased contemporaries, and Italians: so that the other shadowy world\r\nis with him almost a reflexion of his own world here. From the first\r\nstep of his pilgrimage to the last, he sees sights of his own imagining,\r\ntranscending all experience, almost all conception, yet delineated with\r\nsuch vivid precision, in language so simply real, that a feeling only\r\nshort of belief accompanies the reader, and remains with him. Italian\r\npeasants meeting the poet, pointed out, as they looked with awe on “his\r\npale and visionary brow,” the man who had been down to Hell. Prominent\r\ncharacteristics of his poetry are strength, daring, intensity, grace,\r\nabsolute self-reliance, and boundless invention: above all, the\r\ncontinual self-presence of the poet as the centre to his own thoughts,\r\nand to the worlds which he traverses and describes. He began to write\r\nhis poem in Latin verse; but Dante was too essentially a poet to write\r\nout of his mother-tongue;--a poet expresses _himself_ in his verse, and\r\nonly the mother-tongue is near enough to him for that.\r\n\r\n  [This Bust is by Alessandro d’Este, and was placed in the Protomoteca\r\n  at the expense of Canova. It corresponds in the chief characteristics\r\n  of the face with the portraits taken from the life, of which there are\r\n  several. In Florence Cathedral, near the tomb of Giotto, is an\r\n  authentic portrait. The one lately discovered on a wall in the palace\r\n  of the Podestà at Florence, is extremely interesting, as being a\r\n  youthful likeness by the hand of his friend Giotto. The monument to\r\n  Dante in S. Croce is the work of Stefano Ricci. It was erected in\r\n  1829, at the public expense.]\r\n\r\n174. FRANCESCO PETRARCA. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Tuscany, 1304. Died at Argua, near Padua, 1374. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nThe crown around the brow of Petrarch has many gems. He is poet,\r\ndiplomatist, scholar, and restorer of ancient letters. To the world, he\r\nis the great Italian sonnetteer. This extremely artificial metrical\r\nscheme, which seems, however, singularly congenial to his native speech,\r\nafforded him the temptation, in the means, to write incessant effusions\r\non one love, really or ideally entertained. He was an ecclesiastic under\r\na law of celibacy. Thus separated from the object of his presumed\r\naffections, he allied his soul to hers in verse. His love-strains are\r\nstudies, without number, of the passion, in its endlessly varying moods\r\nand moments--half of them wreaths laid at the feet of the living\r\nLaura--half, strewings on her untimely tomb. The flowers, disclosed by\r\nthe rapidly advancing Spring of the language, breathe the freshness,\r\nsweetness, and innocent grace of the season. Ever since, every son of\r\nsong in Italy strikes this lute of a few chords, but Petrarch remains\r\nits Apollo.\r\n\r\n  [By Carlo Finelli.]\r\n\r\n175. GIACOMO SANAZZARO. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Naples, 1458. Died there, 1530. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nA devoted adherent of the House of Arragon, whom he followed in their\r\ndisastrous campaign in defence of the Church. During his travels he\r\npublished his poem of “Arcadia,” which gave a new phase to Italian\r\npoetry. A great admirer of Virgil and Propertius.\r\n\r\n  [From his tomb in Santa Maria del Parto at Naples, by Girolamo Santa\r\n  Croce, a Neapolitan sculptor of the 15th century. His tomb is one of\r\n  the most beautiful monuments of the time; designed by Santa Croce, and\r\n  sculptured by Montorsoli. Two weeping angels lean over the bust which\r\n  bears the name ACTIUS SINCERUS, under which he published many of his\r\n  works. At the sides of the tomb are statues of Apollo and Minerva,\r\n  said to be antique, but now called David and Judith.]\r\n\r\n176. LUIGI ARIOSTO. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Reggio, in Italy, 1474. Died at Ferrara, 1533. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nA poet from the cradle: constrained by his father to bestow five years\r\non the study of the law: then released to literature. He was Gentleman\r\nof the Court to two princes: from both he received scanty pay: from the\r\none 75 crowns (or about £15 a year), from the other 84 crowns. He lived\r\nand died poor, having enjoyed great independence of spirit, and the\r\nbarren respect of Italian princes. His talents for business were\r\nremarkable. His great poem the “Orlando Furioso” is of a species which\r\nthen deluged Italian literature. It is a web of adventures of knight\r\nerrantry. These turn round the person of Charlemagne, and the invasion\r\nof France by the Moors--poetically misdated to his reign. The copious\r\nflow and untiring spirit of the narrative is without comparison. The\r\nskill with which Ariosto carries on a labyrinth of separate adventures,\r\nand brings them to meet, is peculiar to himself. The variety in the\r\ninvention of the characters, and the flexibility of the pure and musical\r\nstyle to the humorous or the pathetic, the warlike or the tender, the\r\nnatural and the marvellous, are singularly characteristic of the power\r\nof this poet; who grasps his subject meanwhile like a man of business\r\nand of the world, and whose tone is, on the whole, rather that of\r\nintellectual superiority to his subject than of passionate absorption by\r\nit. A vein even of irony breaks through; and the enthusiastic lover of\r\nromance suffers a pang of scepticism from the suggested incredulity of\r\nhis priest. They tell, how, when governor of a wild Appenine province,\r\nhe fell, on a solitary walk, into the hands of banditti. The captain, on\r\nrecognising the poet of the Orlando Furioso, apologized for the rudeness\r\nof his men, and set his captive at liberty.\r\n\r\n  [By Carlo Finelli. There is a life-size bust upon his monument in the\r\n  Benedictine Monastery at Ferrara, where he is buried.]\r\n\r\n177. TORQUATO TASSO. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Sorrento, near Naples, 1544. Died at Rome, 1595. Aged 51.]\r\n\r\nOne of the small cluster of spirits whose uttered thoughts have fastened\r\nupon the world’s ear for all time. One of the still smaller group whose\r\npersonal history, growing out of the poetical temperament, weighs in\r\ninterest against their consummate work. We discover too little of the\r\nlife of Shakspeare. We know too much of the story of Torquato Tasso. The\r\nSwan of Avon sings, and not a milk-white feather is ruffled in the song.\r\nPersonal anguish quivers through the high heroic strain of him who, in\r\nItalian, with unequalled art, told the inspiriting story of the\r\nrecovered Holy City. How shall Torquato’s touching and saddening tale be\r\nconcentrated in a sentence? He was already a scholar when a\r\nchild--delicately organized in the flesh--wondrously endowed in soul. At\r\neighteen he had given forth a poem--worthy sign of his coming strength.\r\nHe was at the Court of Alphonso II., Duke of Ferrara, when he commenced\r\nhis great epic, and dared--he was a poet’s son--to fix his strong\r\naffection upon the Princess Leonora, sister of the Duke. In 1575, the\r\n“Jerusalem Delivered” was completed. Its beauty was too evident, for it\r\nraised a pitiless storm of envy, enmity, and persecution. His passion\r\nfor the princess was detected, and he was imprisoned as a madman.\r\nBreaking loose, he wandered footsore from place to place, but found his\r\nway too speedily back to Ferrara. Caught again, he was again confined,\r\nsuffering new imprisonment for seven long years. He came forth at last,\r\na melancholy man. It availed him little that at Rome, in 1595, he was\r\nsolemnly crowned with laurel by the pope, and every honour showered upon\r\nhis illustrious head. He died, worn out with troubles of heart and mind,\r\nonly a few days after his sublime coronation. The “Jerusalem Delivered”\r\nis built upon the essential basis of epic poetry--the profound and\r\nassociated sympathy of innumerable hearers. In the poem, as out of it,\r\nthe universal heart of Christendom is arrayed against the misbelieving\r\nworld. Tasso wrote in an age when the religious passion, which was the\r\nsoul of the Crusades, survived sufficiently for a hope in the poet that\r\nhis strain would reanimate the Red-cross warfare. As man, and as poet,\r\nenthusiasm was predominant in him. The salient characters of the poem\r\nare well-defined, each complete in itself, and all standing well apart\r\nfrom, and relieving one another, although hardly, perhaps, flung forth\r\nin desirable plenitude of dramatic life and effect. The subject, as we\r\nall know, was the successful first Crusade--which took Jerusalem--under\r\nthe pious, magnanimous, and truly heroic Godfrey of Bouillon. The\r\nstructure of the plot is well balanced: the art of the writing\r\nexquisite: possibly too much so. It is generally self-conscious and\r\nelaborate, rather than inspired and impetuous.\r\n\r\n  [By Alessandro d’Este, and presented to the Capitoline Museum by\r\n  Canova. Tasso’s tomb in St. Onuphrius was not erected until some time\r\n  after his death. There is a portrait in mosaic over it.]\r\n\r\n178. PIETRO BONAVENTURA METASTASIO. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, 1698. Died at Vienna, 1782. Aged 84.]\r\n\r\nBorn of poor parents. When ten years old, improvised in the streets of\r\nRome; then adopted and educated by Gravina, a rich juris-consult, who\r\nleft the poet all his fortune. Forty editions of Metastasio’s works were\r\npublished before his death. He wrote many tragic operas, besides\r\nnumerous smaller compositions. Invited by Charles VI. of Austria, he\r\nsettled in Vienna, and received the title of Imperial Poet. His style is\r\nsingularly chaste, harmonious, and elegant. Attracted to, and attracting\r\nby, the delineation of characters, morally pure and elevated. Pathetic,\r\nbut his passion lacks individuality. When we have read a few of his\r\nworks, we have read all. In person tall and commanding.\r\n\r\n  [By Ceracchi. There is a fine bust of him by Vinnazar of Vienna.\r\n  Metastasio was buried in St. Michael’s Church, at Vienna, but the\r\n  place is not known.]\r\n\r\n179. CARLO GOLDONI. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Venice, 1707. Died at Paris, 1793. Aged 86.]\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated Italian comic poet of the eighteenth century, and\r\nthe renovator of the comic stage in his country. When eight years old,\r\nsketched out a play. After some reverses of fortune, settled in Paris,\r\nwhere he wrote his last work, “Materials for a History of his Life and\r\nTheatre.” He wrote 150 pieces for the stage, introducing all classes of\r\nmen, whom he described with surprising truth. He reformed the Italian\r\ndrama by extinguishing the fashion of playing in masks, and by doing\r\naway with certain conventional characters before introduced into every\r\nplay. His works are not without the defects of an over-abundant and\r\nextraordinarily rapid composition; but he has the great merit of\r\nfaithfully portraying men in their affections, their habits, follies,\r\nand vices.\r\n\r\n  [By Leandro Biglioschi.]\r\n\r\n180. VITTORIO ALFIERI. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Asti, in Piedmont, 1749. Died at Florence, 1803. Aged 54.]\r\n\r\nHe was of noble origin, and acceded, at the age of 14, to large\r\nhereditary estates. His passions were strong, ardent, and irregular: his\r\neducation was neglected. He travelled much,--rapidly and impatiently,\r\nlike a man fleeing from himself, or seeking, without finding, objects to\r\nsatisfy the capacity of a mind, large but unstored. He was first drawn\r\nwith passion to literature by Plutarch’s Lives; and his first tragedy,\r\n“Cleopatra,” was acted at Turin in 1775, when he was 26 years old.\r\nThenceforward he was devoted to the study of his art. The subjects of\r\nhis tragedies, which follow the simplicity of the Greek model, are\r\nchiefly from ancient mythology, or history. They are distinguished by\r\nintense absorption of the poet in his dramatic action and persons, by\r\nthe austere exclusion from the plot of everything accidental or\r\ninoperative to the main purpose and catastrophe, and by the rejection of\r\nall accessory ornament from his sedulously laboured style. In his hands\r\nthe flowing and languishing Italian speech becomes abrupt, concentrated,\r\ndarted, fiery; harsh, often, until it is dilated into harmony by the\r\nswelling and emphatic intonations of the actual theatre. He raised at\r\nonce the prostrate Italian tragedy to the rank of an art, and to a\r\ncompetition with the nations. He was a passionate lover of horses,\r\nlicentious in his attachments, and an ardent partisan of liberty.\r\n\r\n  [Alfieri was buried in Santa Croce. Canova, commissioned by the\r\n  Countess of Albany, sculptured his tomb and the medallion of him which\r\n  is upon it. This bust is by Domenica Manera, and no doubt is a good\r\n  likeness, having been executed under Canova’s eye.]\r\n\r\n181. ALESSANDRO GAVAZZI. _Monk and Orator._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bologna, in Italy, 1809. Still living.]\r\n\r\nAt the age of 16, entered the religious order of St. Barnabas.\r\nSubsequently appointed Professor of Rhetoric at Naples. Upon the\r\naccession of Pope Pius IX. to the pontifical chair, Gavazzi warmly\r\nupheld the liberal policy then announced by the head of the Catholic\r\nChurch. He was the “Peter the Hermit” of the crusade in Lombardy against\r\nAustria in 1848: and shared the dangers of the troops, whom he animated\r\nby his eloquence. Upon the entry of the French under Oudinot into Rome,\r\nGavazzi quitted Italy with the patriots. He has since lived in London,\r\nwhere his extraordinary political discourses have created a marked\r\nimpression upon his listeners. His oratory is adapted to large masses,\r\nhis memoir is extraordinary, and his manner exceedingly picturesque and\r\nstriking. He is not a scholar, and his patriotism is not of the kind\r\nthat suffers by defeat. Gavazzi makes a good income as a popular\r\npreacher. Mazzini lives upon a crust.\r\n\r\n  [This bust is by Piericcini.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC MEN AND WRITERS.\r\n\r\n182. CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. _The Discoverer of the New World._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Genoa, 1436. Died at Valladolid, in Spain, 1506. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nLord Bacon says, that he, who unites the faculties of speculation and of\r\naction, is like one born, according to the faith of the astrologers,\r\nunder Saturn and Jupiter in conjunction, and may command the world.\r\nColumbus--profound in thought, intense in action--did even more. To one\r\nworld he gave another. He was essentially an intellectual hero; for he\r\ndared to believe, on grounds sufficing to reason, that which the world\r\ndisbelieves, and scoffs, and scorns. He was essentially a practical\r\nhero: witness his persevering urgency of kings and states to undertake\r\nthe first visiting of a world which his instructed spirit already\r\ndiscerned in the far off seas. Witness also his conduct of his fleet,\r\nwearied with vain expectation on the silent main, and rising to mutiny\r\non the apparently confirmed disappointment of its hopes. His services to\r\nman no human gratitude could repay, yet he died overwhelmed with\r\naffliction, great vexation and bodily infirmity. In 1492, he discovered\r\nSan Salvador, Cuba, and St. Domingo. In 1493, his eager foot first trod\r\nthe Antilles. In 1498, America opened to his importunate gaze. His\r\nfourth voyage of discovery was delayed by an event that merits record in\r\nevery history of the world’s progress. He was thrown into prison.\r\nObtaining liberty, his eager and mysteriously informed spirit was\r\nbrooding again on the wide ocean. He reached the Gulf of Darien. We\r\nwitness to-day, in the prosperity, might, and civilization of the\r\nAmerican people, the latest glorious results of the restless intrepidity\r\nand bright intelligence of Christopher Columbus. Before the dazzling\r\nspectacle we may yet learn humility, if we will only remember the sorrow\r\nof those upon whom the unveiling of America instantly let in the sword\r\nand the fire. Columbus was the first observer of the variation and the\r\ndip of the needle.\r\n\r\n  [By Raimondo Trentanove.]\r\n\r\n183. NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI. _Political Writer and Historian._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Florence, 1469. Died there, 1527. Aged 58.]\r\n\r\nFor fourteen years, Machiavelli, born of a noble family, acted as\r\nSecretary of the Florentine Republic, and was charged with several\r\nimportant missions. Upon the return of the Medici to Florence in 1512,\r\nhe was implicated in a conspiracy formed against them, was imprisoned\r\nand put to the torture. Subsequently released by Pope Leo X., he was\r\nreinstated in his office. It was after his liberation that he wrote his\r\nDiscourses upon Livy, his books on the Art of War, and his celebrated\r\nessay, called “The Prince.” Machiavelli, to our imagination, embodies in\r\nhis individual person the Idea of Italian political subtlety. His chief\r\nwork, already mentioned, “The Prince,” expounds the art of Reigning: _i.\r\ne._ of acquiring and preserving Power;--of which art perfidy and murder\r\nare, in this exposition, two accepted instruments. The prevalent\r\nassumption has been that Machiavelli recommends the practice of the art,\r\nsuch as he expounds it. Later vindicators have said that he describes,\r\nwithout approving, the Art of Reigning as exercised by the Italian\r\nprinces of his day, and that his book is to be regarded as containing a\r\nsatire, and not a doctrine. The bust before the visitor may furnish\r\nmaterials for the study of this curious question.\r\n\r\n  [From the bust in the Florence Gallery. A most interesting work of the\r\n  time, bearing the date 1495. An undoubted likeness of this celebrated\r\n  man. Full of character, with every indication of having been done from\r\n  the life, although the author is now unknown. Machiavelli’s tomb is in\r\n  St^{a}. Croce at Florence. Two centuries after his death, Lord Cowper,\r\n  in 1787, placed over it a bas-relief portrait which was paid for by\r\n  public subscription set on foot by Lord Cowper, and was executed by\r\n  Innocenzo Spinazzi.]\r\n\r\n184. ANNIBALE CARO. _Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Città-Nuova, in Illyria, 1507. Died, 1566. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nHis chief work was a free translation of the Æneid in blank verse: the\r\nstyle is pure, and the sense faithful. Also wrote humorous pieces in the\r\npurest Tuscan.\r\n\r\n  [The work of Antonio d’Este, at the expense of Elizabeth, Duchess of\r\n  Devonshire, the second wife of the late Duke, a lady to whom we are\r\n  indebted for originating the excavations in the Forum at Rome.]\r\n\r\n185. GALILEO GALILEI. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Pisa, 1564. Died 1642. Aged 78.]\r\n\r\nOne of the self-dedicated inquiring spirits, to whom to behold Truth\r\nis--to live:--a hierophant of Nature! Whilst Bacon in England was laying\r\ndown, in form, and theoretically, the laws of experimental philosophy,\r\nGalileo in Italy, led by instinct or intuition, was putting them in\r\nforce. If Bacon stands out as the legislator of our great modern\r\nstudents in physical science, Galileo is assuredly their most\r\nillustrious and animating exemplar. We think of the stern and strenuous\r\nobserver as we do of the prophets, who stand up in the might of\r\ninvincible truth, solitary against a world. In the very first sentence\r\nof the “Novum Organum” it is written that, “Man, the servant and\r\ninterpreter of Nature, knoweth, and can, so much as, in the fact or in\r\nthought, he may have observed, of the order of Nature.” Of all men\r\nGalileo was essentially the one who allowed Nature to speak for\r\nherself,--and waited patiently, piously, and thoughtfully for her\r\nutterances, never imposing upon her his own wilful and imperfect\r\nconceptions. His spirit was self-sustaining. Hundreds, or thousands,\r\nhave in the later time risen, who from the cradle to the grave have\r\nwatched Nature. But they are the officers of an organized army. He\r\nwalked like Hercules, with his club and lion’s skin cloak, alone.\r\nBecause his worship was pure, his punishment was great. Suffering for\r\ntruth’s sake, he was imprisoned for years; yet his only crime had been,\r\nthat he had faithfully recorded the revelations that came down to him\r\ndirectly from the skies. To Galileo we owe, amongst other obligations,\r\nthe discovery of the laws of gravity, the invention of the pendulum, of\r\nthe hydrostatic balance, of the thermometer. He constructed a telescope,\r\nand with it discovered the satellites and rings of Jupiter, the phases\r\nof Venus, and the spots on the sun. Noting down what he saw, he changed\r\nthe whole system of astronomy, and led men on the right track of\r\nobservation for all ages to come. Italy, with her many titles to our\r\nadmiration, gratitude and respect, has no prouder claim than this:--She\r\ngave us Galileo. The face before us does not belie the soul. Upon it are\r\nstamped the rigid signs of robust and intrepid intellect.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble, by Domenico Manera, which was placed in the\r\n  Capitoline Museum at the cost of Canova. About a century after\r\n  Galileo’s death, in the year 1737, leave was at last granted to erect\r\n  a monument to his memory in Santa Croce, at Florence; it was placed\r\n  opposite to that of Michelangelo, and the bones of the great\r\n  philosopher were removed into it. In the Museum of the Florence\r\n  Gallery is preserved the small telescope which he used. The bust, No.\r\n  185A, is a cast from that on his tomb.]\r\n\r\n185A.

Upon his death, the grateful Florentine\r\npeople inscribed on his tomb the title of “Father of his Country.” A\r\nmember of the Signory, which legislated for the Florentine Republic, he\r\nstrove to curb the oligarchy in the State. Accordingly, many of the\r\nchief families combined against him, and it was only by the most\r\nadmirable judgment and consummate prudence that he was enabled to elude\r\ntheir toils, and to advance the popular cause. Possessed of immense\r\nwealth, he parted freely with his riches for the glory of his country,\r\nand for the promotion of all those arts that add dignity to human nature\r\nand beautify the world.\r\n\r\n  [From the bust in the Florence Gallery, a most characteristic head.]\r\n\r\n188.

Fighting against and nearly destroying the army of\r\nthe ambitious Duke of Milan, he went over to the enemy with 500\r\nsoldiers. He now fought against the Venetians; but in 1446, was thrown\r\ninto prison on a charge of treason. Released by the Milanese, he\r\ndeserted to the Venetians, whom he again led on against his latest\r\nemployers. Instead of fighting Sforza, the Milanese general, he deserted\r\nto his side, and assisted him to gain the sovereignty of Milan.\r\nImmediately afterwards he returned to the Venetians, and, strange to\r\nsay, continued their generalissimo for twenty-one years. The Senate,\r\nupon his death, employed the celebrated Andrea Verrocchio to raise an\r\nequestrian statue in bronze to his memory, of which the one before the\r\nvisitor is a cast. Shortly before his death, Coleoni, not without\r\nreason, warned the Venetian Senate not to trust another man with such\r\npower as they had confided to him.\r\n\r\n  [For account of this fine equestrian statue, see Handbook to the\r\n  Renaissance Court.]\r\n\r\n189. STEFANO GATTAMELATA. _Warrior._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Narni, in Italy. Died at Venice, 1443.]\r\n\r\nFirst served in the army of the Church: but in 1434 passed over to the\r\nVenetians, and was made Captain-General of their army. A zealous servant\r\nof the State. He was raised to the rank of Venetian noble in 1438; rich\r\npensions were conferred upon him, and a palace was given him in the\r\ncity. The equestrian statue of which the one in the Crystal Palace is a\r\ncast, is by Donatello, and is at Padua.\r\n\r\n  [For account of this equestrian statue, see Handbook to the\r\n  Renaissance Court.]\r\n\r\n190. GIOVANNI MEDICI, surnamed BANDINERI. _Italian Soldier._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1498. Died near Borgo-Forte, in Italy, 1526. Aged 28.]\r\n\r\nA descendant of Cosmo, “the father of his country,” and the son of the\r\ncelebrated Catharine Sforza. Passionately fond of arms, he was employed,\r\nin 1521, by the Florentines against the Duke of Urbino. In 1524, he\r\nentered the service of France, and a year or two afterwards died of a\r\nwound. He was ferocious, and mercilessly cruel. After his death his\r\nsoldiers, who had profited by his instruction and example, styled\r\nthemselves “The Black Bands”--“Bandineri.” The chief of the butchers is\r\ndistinguished in history by the unenviable title.\r\n\r\n  [A very finely-formed head, from the figure in the Piazza San Lorenzo,\r\n  Florence.]\r\n\r\n191. FRANCESCO PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA.\r\n\r\n  [Died, 1321.]\r\n\r\nA gentleman of Modena, at the head of the Ghibelline faction, in\r\nfighting whose battles with the Guelphs he passed his life. In 1312, he\r\nfilled the office of Podestà of Modena, but was expelled from the city\r\nthe very same year by the Guelph party. Returning, he sold his authority\r\nfor 50,000 florins to Bonacossi, Lord of Mantua, and retired to his\r\nestates at Mirandola, whither Bonacossi followed him, assassinated him\r\nand his two sons, and made off with the purchase money.\r\n\r\n  [From a terracotta in the Berlin Museum.

Aged 73.]\r\n\r\nOne of the world’s great and successful generals. The great-grandson of\r\nEmanuel, Duke of Savoy, his mother being niece of Cardinal Mazarin.\r\nRefused a regiment by Louis XIV., he offered his services to the flag of\r\nAustria, and fought as a volunteer for the Emperor against the Turks.\r\nThe deeds of the young soldier caused Louis XIV. to repent of his former\r\nrefusal, but the most tempting offers came in vain to Eugene. He took\r\npart with Marlborough in all his great victories in the Low Countries,\r\nexpelled the French from Italy, and overthrew the Turks, from whom he\r\ntook the city of Belgrade. His renown at the peace of 1718, when he\r\nretired from active service, stood as high as any soldier’s of the age.\r\nIn retirement Prince Eugene cultivated literature and the arts. His\r\nservices had extended through the reigns of three Emperors, and he\r\nfought with almost unvarying success. He was ambitious of glory, and of\r\nnothing else. He was never married. He invented no system of military\r\ntactics, and he followed none. He had the faculty of discerning the\r\nright thing to do at the right time, and of arranging his plans quickly\r\nand ably in conformity with the circumstances by which he was\r\nsurrounded. His mind once made up, his intrepidity was boundless. He was\r\nrigid in disposition; his figure was well made, though not tall; his eye\r\nwas black and piercing, and his complexion dark.\r\n\r\n  [A fine portrait statue by Canigia, a Piedmontese sculptor lately\r\n  dead.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELATES AND THEOLOGIANS.\r\n\r\n193. FRANCISCO XIMENEZ DE CISNEROS. _Cardinal and Regent of Spain._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Castile, 1437. Died, 1517. Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nA learned priest who had withdrawn to a convent, and was in his\r\nfifty-sixth year, when Queen Isabella of Spain brought him from his\r\nretirement, and appointed him Archbishop of Toledo, and her own\r\nConfessor. His power over the queen was used, according to the ideas of\r\nhis time, in the interests of his country, for the benefit of the\r\nSpanish people, and for the advancement of learning and religion. After\r\nthe death of Isabella, in 1504, he was made Governor of Spain, in the\r\nabsence of the King, and he managed to steer his political course with\r\nconsummate skill and prudence. In 1516, he became Governor of Castille\r\nfor the young Emperor, Charles V. He possessed in an eminent degree the\r\ngenius of government, and his rule paved the way for the greatness of\r\nCharles V.’s reign. He was unbending in authority, and organized with a\r\nrigid sense of justice, that amounted to cruelty. As Inquisitor-General,\r\nhe had suffered, during eleven years of office, 50,000 condemnations to\r\nbe passed, and 2500 human beings to be consigned to the flames. Shortly\r\nbefore his own death he fell into disgrace, and he closed his eyes in\r\ngrief. He was a fanatic without passion. Pious with sword in hand;\r\naustere in his way of life, sagacious, imperious, and a profound\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\n194. CARLO REZZONICO, afterwards POPE CLEMENT XIII. _Pope._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Venice, 1693. Died at Rome, 1769. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nCommenced his pontifical reign by an endeavour to improve the morals of\r\nhis clergy and his people; but, later, he created displeasure in Europe\r\nby protecting the Jesuits, who had been expelled from France and\r\nPortugal. He consented at last to the suppression of the Order, and\r\nexpired almost as soon as the consent was given. It is rather surprising\r\nthat he did not die shortly before. A man of sincere piety, pure\r\nintentions, and great charity.\r\n\r\n  [From the celebrated monument by Canova. Although the bust is of\r\n  colossal proportions, the features preserve their natural, harmonious\r\n  expression.]\r\n\r\n194*. PADRE VENTURA. _Italian Priest._\r\n\r\n  [Still living.]\r\n\r\nBorn at Palermo, towards the close of the last century. At an early age,\r\nentered the order of the Teatini: subsequently appointed Professor of\r\nthe University of Rome. When, in 1821, Naples, Piedmont, and Spain rose\r\nfor the recovery of freedom, and the hopes of the liberal party were\r\nraised to the highest pitch in Italy, Ventura sympathized with the\r\npopular voice. He was instantly dismissed from his office, and his\r\nwritings were denounced. When, in 1831, the Italian liberals were\r\ncrushed by Austria, the Padre took counsel of his judgment, craved to be\r\nreconciled with the clerical party, and was made supreme head of his\r\nOrder. Deceived by the early policy and promises of Pius IX., Ventura,\r\nin 1846, again gave rein to his liberal ideas, and returned to his\r\noriginal sympathies. His oration on the death of O’Connell, delivered at\r\nRome, was bold and pathetic, and so far won for him the regard of his\r\nancient allies, that on the success of the Sicilians, who threw off the\r\nNeapolitan yoke, he was named their representative at the court of Rome.\r\nAnother change came over the spirit of Ventura’s life. The Pope--his\r\nfriend--was chased from Rome; and he himself prudently awaited, in\r\nCività Vecchia, the result of the French invasion undertaken on the\r\nPope’s behalf. Upon the fall of Rome he repaired to France, and there\r\nspeedily wrote a formal recantation of all his “errors.” At this hour he\r\npreaches in Paris in favour of Ultra-montane doctrines, and is\r\nsurrounded by admirers. He is learned, polished, courtier-like, and very\r\neloquent: not a popular preacher like Gavazzi, but with a style and\r\nmanner adapted to a cultivated audience.\r\n\r\n  [By Rinaldo Rinaldi, of Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGS AND QUEENS.\r\n\r\n195. CHARLES ALBERT. _King of Sardinia._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1798. Died at Oporto, 1849. Aged 51.]\r\n\r\nA man of unstable principles. Inclined to liberal views, but unequal to\r\nthe effort of steadily maintaining them. At the time of his birth, seven\r\nmale heirs stood between him and the Sardinian throne, but in his\r\nthirty-third year he found himself king. Received his education in\r\nParis. In 1821, headed a conspiracy in order to force more liberal\r\nmeasures upon his sovereign; but betrayed the design before it was ripe\r\nfor execution. In 1823, entered the French service under the Duc\r\nd’Angoulême, and attached himself to the cause of despotism in France.\r\nFrom the date of his ascending the throne, 1831, until his death, he\r\ncontinually vacillated between the extremes of absolutism, and downright\r\nradicalism. In 1848--the year of revolution--he gave his subjects a\r\nconstitution, and the eyes of Italy were turned anxiously towards him as\r\nto a deliverer and friend. Discontent rose against Austria, and he\r\nbecame the champion of Italy against the foreign intruder. Success at\r\nfirst crowned his arms; but weakness and indecision again visited him at\r\nthe crisis of his career, and he suffered defeat at Novara, at the hands\r\nof the Austrian general, Radetzky. Abdicating in favour of his eldest\r\nson, Charles Albert quitted Italy, crossed Spain, and reached Oporto,\r\nwhere he soon died, a disappointed, vexed, and broken-hearted man.\r\n\r\n  [By Canigia, a Piedmontese sculptor of the time.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nFrance surpasses all modern nations in awarding monumental honours to\r\nher illustrious sons. The feeling which prompts the grateful act is more\r\nakin to noble patriotism than to the littleness of personal display. The\r\nmagnificent illustration of the national disposition at Versailles\r\ncommands our respect by the important historical interest which it\r\ncreates, and by the instruction and benefit which it confers upon the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe buildings of all the great institutions of France are adorned with\r\nportrait statues and busts of the men who have earned distinction in\r\nconnexion with them. “The Institute,” which corresponds to our Royal\r\nSociety, has its statues of philosophers and scientific men. The Mazarin\r\nLibrary possesses a collection of those most distinguished in\r\nliterature, generally. The Théâtre Français has an exceedingly\r\ninteresting gallery of dramatists and theatrical celebrities, which is\r\nonly feebly reflected in the collection--valuable in some respects--of\r\ntheatrical portraits at the Garrick Club in London, which we owe chiefly\r\nto the late Mr. Charles Mathews, the comedian.\r\n\r\nThe collection of the Théâtre Français is composed of statues and busts\r\nrepresenting the greatest dramatic writers and the most celebrated\r\ncomedians of the French stage, of pictures of actors or of paintings\r\nhaving reference to the dramatic art. The library is rich in autograph\r\nmanuscripts, and in the letters of nearly all the authors who have\r\nillustrated the French stage. It contains also the registers and account\r\nbooks of the several theatrical administrations, without a single\r\ninterruption, from the 24th of October, 1658--the date of Molière’s\r\nfirst representation in Paris--down to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe collection of statues and busts dates from only the last century,\r\nwhen the sculptor Caffieri laid its foundation. He proposed to the\r\nactors, in 1773, to present to their green-room the bust of his friend\r\nAlexis Piron, the poet (see No. 231 in our collection)--who had died a\r\nfew months before--on the condition that he should be allowed free\r\nentrance to the theatre for the rest of his life. It appears, from the\r\nletter of Caffieri, preserved in the library of the theatre, that the\r\nusual price of his marble busts was £120, and that the right of entrance\r\nto the theatre for life was fixed by the comedians at the same sum. The\r\nproposition was accepted, and Caffieri continued for some time to\r\npresent busts to the theatre upon the same terms--that is to say, for\r\nevery bust the right of an entreé for one of his relatives or friends.\r\nOther sculptors followed the example of Caffieri. The practice still\r\ncontinues, and the collection is yearly augmented, not only by this\r\nmeans, but also by the frequent gifts of the Minister of the Interior,\r\nand by the still larger donations of private individuals.\r\n\r\nThe collection of paintings dates as far back as the death of the\r\ntragedian Lekain. His comrades, to honour his memory, decided that his\r\nlikeness should be hung in their green-room. Later came the portrait of\r\nBaron, and afterwards that of Mademoiselle Duclos by Largillière, a\r\ncelebrated portrait painter of the time of Louis XIV. This portrait of\r\nMdlle. Duclos is a masterpiece. At the present moment, in consequence of\r\nthe frequent additions to this triple collection, there is not space\r\nenough in the interior of the theatre properly to display it; and it is\r\nproposed to transport it to a more commodious receptacle, and to give to\r\nthe _réunion_ of all these treasures of the drama the name of the\r\nMolière Museum. The busts, which we are enabled to exhibit in the\r\nCrystal Palace, form only a small selection from the gallery of the\r\nThéâtre Français.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre, which in Paris corresponds to our British Museum, National\r\nGallery, and Hampton Court combined, has long been one of the world’s\r\ngreat treasuries of history and art. Resting upon ancient walls, founded\r\ncertainly as far back as the 9th century--when it was a strong fortress\r\nin the midst of a forest--the Louvre has been gradually changing its\r\nform and appearance since the time of Philippe Auguste. In 1527, Francis\r\nI., with the aid of the architect Pierre Lescot, entirely remodelled it,\r\nand gave to it the character of splendour and vastness which has ever\r\nsince attached to this great national structure. All succeeding\r\nkings--Charles, Henri, Louis, whatever the name--have done something to\r\nuphold its magnificence. In addition to the other numberless works of\r\nart contained in the Louvre there are some 300 antique portrait busts\r\nand statues, and an immense collection of rare cameos and medals,\r\namongst which are many valuable portraits of antiquity, and about 200\r\nstatues and busts of great men of modern time, half of these being\r\nrepresentations of military men, with some admirals, and about 50\r\nportraits of sculptors and painters.\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Versailles is entirely devoted to the illustration of the\r\nglory of France. Here, in addition to many pictures, representing the\r\ngreat military achievements of the French, there are saloons filled with\r\nstatues and busts of the kings, princes, marshals, and admirals, and\r\nportraits of nearly every great man of the country from the time of\r\nClovis the First and Clotilde, a king and queen of the 5th century, down\r\nto Louis Philippe of our own time. There are more than 600 statues,\r\nbusts and medallions, many of them fine works of art, and all possessing\r\nthe very highest interest. A considerable portion being duplicates of\r\nworks at the Louvre or Tuileries. In such an extensive series there are,\r\nas may be supposed, many arbitrary portraits executed to complete a\r\nseries, but though not taken from the life, they have for the most part\r\nbeen derived from trustworthy authority. There are also upwards of 600\r\nmemorial tablets in bronze, placed in the Gallery of Battles, inscribed\r\nwith the names of all officers killed or wounded in the service of the\r\ncountry, beginning with Prince Robert le Fort, Comte d’Outre-Maine,\r\nkilled at the combat of Brissarthe, in 866, and ending with the heroes\r\nof Waterloo.\r\n\r\nThe Historical Gallery at Versailles contains portrait busts and statues\r\nby 146 different sculptors of France, commencing with Germain Pilon and\r\nJean Goujon, who flourished in the middle of the 16th century.\r\n\r\nFrom all these great collections our Portrait Gallery has been enriched,\r\nas the Catalogue will show.\r\n\r\nAs works of art the French portraits cannot be placed in the highest\r\nrank. The style, as in French works of ideal sculpture, is rather\r\npicturesque, than antique and severe; and few of the portraits are free\r\nfrom a certain affectation of attitude or assumed expression of\r\ncountenance, for which it may readily be conceived, the artist, rather\r\nthan the subject, is to blame. It is rare to find a French bust treated\r\nwith the seriousness and intensity of the antique, or with the\r\nunaffected naturalness of the best busts of the English school: too many\r\nindeed verge upon the common and fatal error of portraiture--caricature.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, take these portraits as the characteristic works of\r\nthe country to which they belong; all of them bear the stamp of\r\ntruthfulness, if some should be found tainted with exaggeration. Many\r\nare models in the art of marble portraiture. Those of Madame Dubarry\r\n(No. 235), and Marie Antoinette (No. 310), are especially beautiful;\r\nthat of Gaston de Foix (No. 258) is also a very noble portrait; and the\r\nbust of Thomas Corneille (No. 222), is one of the finest productions of\r\nthe school. The heads are generally rather larger than life: and the\r\nvisitor cannot fail to remark the exceeding care bestowed upon the wigs\r\nand elaborate embroidery of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_The French Portraits commence immediately behind the Statue of Admiral\r\nDuquesne, in the Great Transept._)\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISTS AND MUSICIANS.\r\n\r\n196. JEAN GOUJON. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris. Died there, 1572.]\r\n\r\nMany of his works were destroyed in the French Revolution, but the\r\nTribune of the “Salle des Cent Suisses,” in the Louvre, the “Diana of\r\nPoictiers,” and the “Fountain of the Innocents,” in Paris, are left to\r\nattest the artist’s superiority. At Malmaison, in France, is another\r\nstatue by him of Diana, remarkable for the beauty of the pose, the\r\nsuppleness of the limbs, and the extraordinary lightness of the drapery.\r\nThe two caryatides in the Renaissance Court are examples of his style.\r\nKilled by a shot from an arquebuse during the massacre of Saint\r\nBartholomew, and whilst he was at work on the decoration of the Louvre.\r\n\r\n  [This is considered to be a bust of the time, and perhaps by his own\r\n  hand.]\r\n\r\n197. SIMON VOUET. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1582. Died there, 1641. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nIs generally regarded as the founder of the French school of painting.\r\nHe received his first instruction from his father, who was also an\r\nartist. When a mere youth, he acquired great fame as a portrait painter.\r\nHe visited Constantinople, where he painted Achmet I. At Rome he worked\r\nfor Pope Urban VIII. at St. Peter’s. Recalled to France by Louis XIII.\r\nin 1637, he was appointed chief painter to the king. His colouring is\r\nfine, and he possesses great boldness of touch; but his drawing is\r\nmarked by mannerism, and he is not happy in perspective, or in his\r\neffects of light and shade. He accomplished, however, for French\r\npainting, what Corneille effected for the drama. He created and raised\r\nthe national taste.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre.]\r\n\r\n198. NICOLAS POUSSIN. PAINTER.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Andelys, in France, 1594. Died in Rome, 1665. Aged 71.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest master of the French school of painting. His taste for art\r\nwas revealed at a very early period. As a child, he drew upon his lesson\r\nbooks and the walls of the school-room. At eighteen, he went to Paris,\r\nwhere he frequented schools from which he learned but little. Genius and\r\nself-tuition did more for him. At thirty he painted the “Death of the\r\nVirgin” for a chapel at Nôtre-Dame, and so well, that the poet Marino\r\ntook the painter to Rome, and recommended him to Cardinal Barberini with\r\nthe energetic words, “You will see a youth who has the spirit of one\r\npossessed.”[31] The Italian syllables are yet stronger. In Rome he fell\r\ninto poverty, and sold his pictures for a mere trifle. He worked against\r\nthe spirit and taste of the age in both France and Italy: throwing\r\nhimself, with his faithful comrade in art, the sculptor Fiamingo,\r\nentirely into the study of the ancient Greek sculpture. He was recalled\r\nto his own country by Richelieu, in 1640, and was created Court Painter.\r\nIn 1643, he returned to Rome, whence no solicitations could again draw\r\nhim. He lived twenty-five years in great calm and happiness, married to\r\nthe sister of Caspar Poussin, without children, without a pupil, without\r\na man-servant--esteeming quiet in the house above everything. He was\r\ndevoted to his art, a great student in it, and of all science bearing\r\nupon it. His genius was altogether antique. He transported himself into\r\nan elder world, and lived there. Thus in religious subjects he seems to\r\nlean towards the Old Testament; and he revels in the wealth of Greek\r\nmythology. His classical spirit ennobled landscape both in its own forms\r\nand by the poetical significance and treatment of the figures. His art,\r\nlike poetry, seemed to open to him an escape from the world about him. A\r\nstyle of severe simplicity, truth, high beauty, harmony.\r\n\r\n  [31] Vederete un giovane che ha la furia del diavolo.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Blaise.]\r\n\r\n199. PIERRE MIGNARD. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Troyes, in France, 1610. Died in Paris, 1695. Aged 85.]\r\n\r\nCalled “The Roman Mignard,” in contradistinction to his brother Nicolas,\r\nalso a painter, and styled “Mignard of Avignon.” The works of Pierre are\r\nnot remarkable for originality of invention or peculiar facility of\r\nexecution; but they exhibit correct design, beauty of form, and\r\nexcellence of colouring. The French regard him as the best colourist of\r\nthe age of Louis XIV. The “Grand Monarque” sat ten times to this\r\npainter, who also painted the portraits of the Popes Urban VIII. and\r\nAlexander VII. Mignard was first intended for the profession of\r\nmedicine, but his taste for drawing led him to the arts. He passed\r\ntwenty-two years in Italy, where he acquired fame. He was recalled to\r\nFrance by his own sovereign, and by him also appointed chief painter to\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by Antoine Coysevox.]\r\n\r\n200. ANDRÉ LE NÔTRE. _Architect and Gardener._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1613. Died there, 1700. Aged 87.]\r\n\r\nThe designer of the magnificent gardens at Versailles; the projector of\r\nits grand fountains, grottos, porticos, and bowers. He also laid out the\r\ngardens of St. Cloud, the Tuileries, Meudon, and several others. Louis\r\nXIV. heaped favours upon this great gardener, but Le Nôtre could not be\r\nspoiled by royal indulgence. He travelled into Italy and was received by\r\nPope Innocent XI. “I care not how soon I die now,” said Le Nôtre to the\r\nPope, “since I have seen the two greatest potentates in the world--your\r\nHoliness and the King, my master.” Le Nôtre was simple, honest, and\r\ndisinterested: possessed a fertile genius and lively imagination; in\r\nmany respects the prototype of our own Paxton.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Gourdel, which was taken from the\r\n  one in the Church of St. Roch.]\r\n\r\n201. EUSTACHE LE SUEUR. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1617. Died 1655. Aged 38.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest French painters. First taught by his father, a\r\nsculptor; then a pupil in the studio of Vouet. His fame established by\r\nthe pictures, twenty-two in number, which he painted for the Chartreuse\r\nin Paris, and which represent the chief events in the life of St.\r\nBruno, the founder of the Order. He took delight in sacred subjects, and\r\nin simple religious affection he left Lebrun and Poussin far behind him.\r\nHe scarcely ever quitted Paris, never France; and his sole studies were\r\nthe few exemplars from the antique which he could find in his native\r\ncity. Raffaelle he could worship only through the engravings of\r\nMarcantonio. But the love of his art was boundless, his study intense,\r\nhis industry inexhaustible. He excelled in purity of form, and his\r\npictures reveal a tenderness of feeling and a spiritual grace, wholly\r\nwanting in the productions of the majority of his contemporaries. He was\r\nhimself a man of mild and blameless nature. He died very early, worn out\r\nby his labours and by the active jealousy of his brother artists.\r\n\r\n  [The costume is that of the time of Louis XIII. From a marble by P. L.\r\n  Laurent, done in 1806. Laurent was a pupil of Pajou, and died in\r\n  1816.]\r\n\r\n202. CHARLES LEBRUN. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1619. Died 1690. Aged 71.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated painters of the French school. The\r\nChancellor, Séguier, struck by his talent when a boy, placed him in the\r\nstudio of Vouet, and subsequently sent him to Rome, where he maintained\r\nhim during six years. In 1648, Lebrun was recalled to France, and\r\nadmitted into the Academy. Mazarin, charmed by his works, presented him\r\nto the king, by whom he was favourably received and largely patronized.\r\nIt is said that Louis XIV. would spend two hours at a time in Lebrun’s\r\nstudio, whilst the artist was painting his “Battles of Alexander,”\r\nAlexander being Louis by allusion. For fourteen years, engaged in\r\npainting the great gallery of Versailles. Received many distinguished\r\nappointments in connexion with the Fine Arts, and at his instigation\r\nLouis XIV. instituted the French Academy at Rome. For many years Lebrun\r\nwas as absolute in the republic of Art, as his master in the kingdom\r\nover which he ruled. He was styled “Dictator,” and his influence is\r\nperceptible in the works of his time. He was one of the vainest of men,\r\nand the most pompous, artificial, and theatrical of painters; his works,\r\nthough they might swell the pride of a Court, would hardly flatter the\r\npride of a country. His best picture is “The Stoning of Stephen,” in the\r\nLouvre.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by A. Coysevox. Extremely interesting,\r\n  both on account of its being taken from the life, and having once\r\n  surmounted the tomb of the great painter which was erected by order of\r\n  his widow in the Church of St. Nicholas, in Paris, the tomb being also\r\n  the work of Coysevox. The monument was removed at the time of the\r\n  Revolution. The bust at Versailles, by Bosio (1837), takes its\r\n  authority from this.]\r\n\r\n203. ANDRÉ FÉLIBIEN, SIEUR DES AVAUX ET DE JAVERCY. _Writer on Art._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Chartres, in France, 1619. Died in Paris, 1695. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nHeld various appointments in connexion with art. Amongst others, those\r\nof Historiographer to the King, and Secretary to the Academy of\r\nArchitecture. His best known work is “Lives of Ancient and Modern\r\nPainters,” which is translated into English. Grave and serious in\r\ncharacter, but, right-minded and good-hearted, he preferred virtue to\r\nthe favours of fortune.\r\n\r\n204. JEAN MABILLON. _Antiquary._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Pierre-Mont, in France, 1632. Died in Paris, 1707. Aged 75.]\r\n\r\nA Benedictine monk, who employed his life in collecting materials and\r\nwriting on monastic history and antiquities. Entitled to high rank for\r\nhis extensive learning and great virtues; his style clear, masculine,\r\nand methodical; his mind free from bigotry.\r\n\r\n205. JEAN BAPTISTE DE LULLY. _Violinist and Musical Composer._\r\n\r\n  [Born near Florence, 1633. Died 1687. Aged 54.]\r\n\r\nA musical genius; who began life as a scullery-boy, and, in soul,\r\ncontinued a scullery-boy to the last. It was whilst playing the fiddle\r\nin the kitchen of Mademoiselle de Montpensier that his musical faculty\r\nwas detected and rescued. Subsequently playing some airs of his own\r\ncomposition to Louis XIV. he was made, at the age of 19, “Inspecteur\r\nGénéral des Violons.” In 1672, letters-patent were granted him to\r\nestablish a Royal Academy of Music: that academy was the Opera. He\r\nperformed marvels at his theatre. He was at once composer, director,\r\nballet-master, leader of the band, and even machinist. Nothing came\r\namiss to him; and his activity, his popularity, his success were\r\nenormous. In less than fifteen years he had composed nineteen operas,\r\nwhich continued in high favour until put out of fashion by Gluck a\r\ncentury afterwards. To appreciate the merits of Lully as a composer, we\r\nmust look at him from the point of view of his own time. So regarded, he\r\nis an artist of great spirit and dramatic power. He found France without\r\nany dramatic music whatever. He left works which formed the style of\r\nlater masters, and became the foundation of a national opera. He had\r\nwit, energy, versatility, and was a great favourite with the Court. His\r\nmoral character was detestable. To the great he was grovelling; to his\r\nearliest benefactress he was ungrateful; towards his dependants he was\r\noverbearing, insolent and brutal.\r\n\r\n  [From the bust in the Church of Petits Pères.]\r\n\r\n206. ANTOINE COYSEVOX. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Lyons, in France, 1640. Died in Paris, 1720. Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nOf Spanish origin. Employed for four years on the decoration of Cardinal\r\nde Furstenburg’s palace, at Saverne, in Alsace. Executed also for Paris,\r\na statue of Louis XIV., and the bronze winged horse placed in the\r\nTuileries gardens. The Revolution destroyed most of his works; but\r\namongst those left is one of the finest--the monument of Colbert. A\r\npersevering and painstaking artist.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by himself. The original bears the\r\n  following inscription:--“Ch: Ant: Coysevox Sculpteur du Roi,\r\n  Chancelier de l’Académie; par lui-même. Donné à l’Académie par Ch.\r\n  Pierre Couston architecte du Roi, son petit neveu.”]\r\n\r\n207. JULES HARDOUIN MANSART. _Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1645. Died at Marly, in France, 1708. Aged 63.]\r\n\r\nThe builder of the Palace of Versailles, and of the Hôtel des Invalides\r\nin Paris: indebted for his celebrity more to the good-will of his\r\nsovereign, Louis XIV., than to his own genius. His works noble and\r\nstriking, but his style not chaste, and apt to fall into extravagance. A\r\nvain man, proud of the favours of the king and jealous of retaining\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by T. L. Lemoyne, a pupil of Coysevox,\r\n  who died in 1755; and doubtless from the life. He wears a damask dress\r\n  with the cordon of St. Michel.]\r\n\r\n207*. CLAUDE JOSEPH VERNET. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Avignon in France, 1714. Died 1789. Aged 75.]\r\n\r\nHe received his first instruction from his father, who was an historical\r\npainter. He set out for Italy in his eighteenth year, and continued\r\nthere for many years, studying and painting for small remuneration. He\r\nreturned to France in 1753, on the invitation of Louis XV., was elected\r\na member of the French Academy, and commissioned by the government to\r\npaint the principal ports of France. He excelled in marine subjects. It\r\nis related of him that during a terrible storm at sea, when all on board\r\nhis ship were trembling for their lives, he caused himself to be lashed\r\nto the mast of the vessel, that he might watch the boiling ocean. The\r\nLouvre contains several of his pictures, which display a consummate\r\nmanagement of light and shade. He had no rival in France whilst he\r\nlived, and he died pencil in hand. He was a modest man, and never so\r\nhappy as when at work.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n208. JACQUES GERMAIN SOUFFLOT. _Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Irancy, in France, 1714. Died in Paris, 1781. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Carthusians rebuilt their church at Lyons, Soufflot’s design\r\nfor the dome was accepted, and he achieved celebrity in consequence.\r\nThen settling in Lyons, built several edifices there, including the\r\ntheatre (one of the finest in France), and the _Hôtel-Dieu_ (the\r\nhospital). Invited to Paris, he became architect to the king. His\r\ndesigns for the Church of Sainte Généviève were adopted; but the cupola\r\nexciting much adverse criticism, the architect fell into despondency,\r\nlanguished and died. Blunt in his manners, but of a generous and noble\r\nmind. He was called the “benevolent cross-patch.”\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Prévot.]\r\n\r\n208*. MARIE-ANNE-BOTOL DANGEVILLE. _French Comic Actress._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1714. Died 1796. Aged 82.]\r\n\r\nActress at the Théâtre Français, and perhaps one of the most perfect\r\nmistresses of her division of the art that have trodden the French\r\nstage. The original of this bust, in the Théâtre Français, has not the\r\nname of the sculptor, but is a work of singular delicacy of expression,\r\nand evidently from the hand of a master.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n208**. MADEMOISELLE CLAIRON. _French Tragic Actress._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1723. Died 1803. Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nThe most accomplished French tragic actress of her time. Born of poor\r\nand illiterate parents. Made her first appearance on the stage in her\r\nthirteenth year. At first unsuccessful, she proved eventually a sublime\r\ntragedian, and during twenty-two years held possession of the public.\r\nDisraeli the elder has a curious story from her life. He relates that as\r\na child she was cruelly treated by a violent mother, and driven all day\r\nto manual labour. One day when locked in a room for punishment, she\r\nclimbed upon a chair to look about her. In the house opposite she saw a\r\ncelebrated actress amidst her family; one daughter performing her\r\ndancing lesson. Clairon noticed with excitement every motion: not one\r\nwas lost upon her. The lesson over, the rest of the children applauded,\r\nand the mother embraced her clever dancer. The scene melted the heart of\r\nClairon, reflecting on her own bitter lot, and she burst into tears. She\r\nascended the chair again, but the vision had vanished. Henceforth she\r\nwas a new child, and never so happy as when locked in that room: from\r\nher chair she watched again and again the happy dancer--imitated her\r\ngestures--reflected her grace. She worshipped a divinity. She had never\r\nbeen to a theatre; yet, without knowing what an actress meant, she had\r\nherself become an actress. Her ardent studies were soon manifest. Her\r\nfirst victory was over her barbarous mother, whom she softened. Her\r\nlater conquest was the subjection of all Paris, and in Paris, of all\r\npolite France and Europe. The anecdote lives, how Voltaire, when his\r\ntragedy of “Oreste” was to be brought out, insisted that his Electra,\r\ncompelled in the palace of her fathers to the discharge of menial\r\noffices, should appear habited as a slave. Mademoiselle Clairon, to whom\r\nthe character fell, resisted. She shrank from flying in the face of the\r\nartificial French taste, and of the traditional stage decorum--both\r\nexpecting a princess arrayed in proper theatrical splendour. The poet\r\npersisted. The piece over, she came to him and said, “Ah! M. de\r\nVoltaire, you have ruined me. All my gorgeous wardrobe is no longer\r\nworth a sou.” She had been released for once to act up to the truth,\r\nnature, and simple reality of her part; and had astonished audience,\r\nactors, herself--all save the poet--by her self-excelling success.\r\n\r\n  [This bust, which is to come, is from a marble by Lemoyne, dated\r\n  1761.]\r\n\r\n209. JACQUES LOUIS DAVID. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1748. Died at Brussels, 1825. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nThe founder of the modern or classical school of French painters. Pupil\r\nof Vien, with whom he passed several years in Italy. Returning to France\r\nin 1780, opened a school, which attracted many pupils. In 1784, paid a\r\nsecond visit to Italy, and on his return was hailed with the title of\r\nRegenerator of Art. Was now admitted into the Academy and lodged in the\r\nLouvre, with the appointment of “Painter to the King.” His pictures\r\nproved eminently successful. His drawing was perfect, and the\r\ncorrectness of his design revealed the pure antique fount from which he\r\nhad quaffed his inspiration. For a time David forsook the easel, to take\r\npart in the fury of Revolutionary politics. He forgot his apartments in\r\nthe Louvre, joined hands with Robespierre, to whom he was personally\r\nattached, and became one of the loudest clamourers for the blood of\r\nLouis XVI. The painter was present at the mock trial of the monarch,\r\nwhom he grossly insulted as the wretched king passed in front of him.\r\nAfter the fall of Robespierre, David owed the preservation of his own\r\nneck solely to his great reputation as an artist. He ceased to be a\r\npolitician to become a dictator in art. During the Consulate his\r\ninfluence was supreme. He not only immortalized some of its heroic\r\npassages, but he designed its official costumes. Buonaparte heaped\r\nfavours upon his artistic panegyrist, and the painter added grace and\r\ndignity to the deeds of the First Consul. The last work of David in\r\nParis was “Leonidas,” painted in 1814. In that year, it is written that\r\nWellington, accompanied by some English officers, visited the artist’s\r\nstudio, and expressed a wish to be painted. The story adds, that David\r\nreplied coldly that “he did not paint Englishmen,” and turned his back\r\nupon his visitor. Upon the return of Napoleon from Elba, David was made\r\nCommander of the Legion of Honour. The next year he was banished as a\r\nregicide, and took up his residence in Brussels. “Napoleon crossing St.\r\nBernard” and “The Coronation of Napoleon” are amongst his offerings to\r\nthe triumphs of the Emperor. Classical and correct in design, David\r\nfails in colour, and in picturesque expression. His figures, too, have a\r\nhard and marble-like appearance. A large swelling at the side of his\r\nface was caused by a blow he received, when young. It has been justly\r\nsaid that opinions of David will vary, accordingly as they are expressed\r\nby Frenchmen or by foreigners.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Rude, 1831.]\r\n\r\n210. CHARLES PERCIER. _Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1764. Died, 1838. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nKnown by his works in conjunction with Fontaine. The influence of the\r\nlabours of both is matter of history in art. To them is due the\r\ncompletion of the Louvre and the erection of the arch in the _Place du\r\nCarrousel_ at Paris. Percier wrote several works on art. In his youth\r\nsent to Rome to study, where he gained the friendship of Flaxman and\r\nCanova. Modest and retiring; and in the pursuit of his art most\r\npersevering.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by Pradier.]\r\n\r\n211. GIRODET-TRIOSON. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Montargis, in France, 1767. Died in Paris, 1824. Aged 57.]\r\n\r\nThe real name of this artist was Anne-Louis Girodet de Coussy; but he\r\ntook the name of Trioson from his adopted father and benefactor, a\r\nphysician, to whom he was indebted for his education. He was the son of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans’ steward, and intended for the army, but evincing a\r\ngreat taste for painting, was placed in the studio of David. Afterwards\r\nproceeding to Rome, he received the first prize for a work of art in\r\nthat city. At the end of five years returned to Paris, where an\r\napartment was assigned him in the Louvre. In 1806, he gained a prize by\r\nhis picture of “The Deluge,” competing with his old master, David.\r\nGirodet did not produce many works, habitual ill-health disabling his\r\npencil; but he left enough behind him to maintain his reputation. His\r\nchief pictures are “Endymion,” “Hippocrates,” “The Revolt in Cairo,” and\r\n“Napoleon Receiving the Keys of Vienna.” The colouring of Girodet is\r\ncold and earthy; and his figures, whilst revealing the classic form and\r\ncorrect drawing that characterize the labours of all David’s pupils,\r\nlose the expression of inward life. In spite of obvious deficiencies in\r\ntruthful representation, his paintings produce a deep, and occasionally\r\na powerful impression.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre--the author unknown. One by M. Roman was\r\n  in the French Exhibition of 1827.]\r\n\r\n212. FRANÇOIS GÉRARD. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, 1770. Died in Paris, 1837. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nStudied under Pajou the sculptor, then with Brenet, and finally with\r\nDavid, whom he assisted in several works, until 1794, when he exhibited\r\nhis own picture of “The Tenth of August” (the day of the storming of the\r\nTuileries in 1792). Under the influence of David, Gérard became one of\r\nthe jury of the Revolutionary Tribunal--an office from which he\r\nsubsequently shrunk. He received great honour and distinction at the\r\nhands of Napoleon; and the Emperor Alexander, and the Duke of\r\nWellington, became his friends. A man of extensive knowledge, and, as a\r\npainter, to be recommended for taste and refinement, rather than for\r\ninvention or sublimity. His colouring, though harmonious, is not always\r\ntrue. His subjects were chiefly historical, and in these the arrangement\r\nof the figures and the selection of costume are always pleasing. He was\r\nalso successful as a portrait painter.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by Pradier, 1838.]\r\n\r\n213. ANTOINE JEAN GROS. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1771. Died there, 1835. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished of David’s pupils. Appalled by the horrors\r\nof the first Revolution, he quitted France, and withdrew to Geneva;\r\nthence to Milan, where he became known to Buonaparte, by whom he was\r\ncountenanced and employed. He followed the army for six years, and\r\nreturned to France in 1801. Then painted several pictures commemorative\r\nof Napoleon’s military achievements. He enjoyed ample patronage under\r\nboth the Emperor, and the Restoration; but in his later years he fell\r\ninto melancholy; and one morning his body was found in the Seine. His\r\ncompositions are remarkable for boldness and facility of invention; but\r\nhis colouring is frequently exaggerated. His subjects, too, though\r\ninvariably treated with power, degenerate occasionally into vulgarity\r\nand theatrical display. His best picture is “The Plague at Jaffa.” He\r\nwas a man of cultivated mind, and passionately fond of music.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Debay Sen., 1827.]\r\n\r\n214. PIERRE NARCISSE GUÉRIN. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1774. Died at Rome, 1833. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nThe son of an humble shopkeeper, and in early years self-instructed. As\r\na painter he was the pupil of Regnault, under whom he soon became\r\ndistinguished for facility of execution and refined composition. He\r\nsubsequently studied several years in Rome. In 1822, appointed Director\r\nof the French Academy. He was not distinguished either for design or\r\ncolour; but his figures are full of expression. His subjects chiefly\r\nmythological and classical.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Auguste Dumont, 1831, author of the\r\n  statue of Louis Philippe, at Versailles, and lately deceased.]\r\n\r\n215. COMTE D’ORSAY.\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1798. Died there, 1852. Aged 54.]\r\n\r\nA man of fashion, endowed with exquisite taste and with great talent for\r\nthe cultivation of art. He resided many years in England, where he\r\ninfluenced the taste of a portion of society, and practised sculpture\r\nand painting as an amateur. Towards the close of his life he withdrew to\r\nParis, and there received an appointment in connexion with the fine\r\narts, from his former friend the Emperor of France. He had engaging\r\nmanners, a kind heart, and an open hand. Possessed of great personal\r\nbeauty, he was not wanting in manly attributes, being athletic, and\r\nskilled in arms and horsemanship.\r\n\r\n  [This excellent work and admirable likeness is by W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n216. MADEMOISELLE FELIX RACHEL. _Tragic Actress._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Munf, in Switzerland, 1821. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe daughter of poor Hebrew parents. In 1831, this famous actress made\r\nher debût at the Theâtre Molière, in Paris, as Hermione in “Andromaque;”\r\nbut without giving indication of the genius she has subsequently\r\ndisplayed. In 1841, she first appeared in England, and from that time\r\nhas won unbounded admiration, and maintained an undivided supremacy both\r\nhere and in France. French dramatic poetry, which ordinarily finds no\r\nwelcome in English ears, is reconciled to our taste as it falls from her\r\nlips. Her excellence consists in the emphatic expression of deep feeling\r\nand passion, in the thrilling effects which she is able to produce, even\r\nby a whisper, and in her independent superiority over the traditions and\r\nconventionalities of the stage. She is the least unnatural of French\r\ntragedians; yet is not so natural as to be able altogether to conceal\r\nher art. The spectator never forgets that an actress is before him; is\r\nnever carried away by an irresistible impulse. Rachel, great as she is,\r\nis always the same, even to the motion of a garment, and the raising of\r\nher hand. Hence, the impression made by a first representation is far\r\nmore potent than any that may follow. She lacks ideality and refinement.\r\nHer temperament stands between her and her ability to inspire the\r\nspectator with a perfect belief in her earnestness, and in her love of\r\nthe beautiful and good.\r\n\r\n  [Bust by Ludwig Wichmann. Plaster. 1844. The original in possession of\r\n  the artist.]\r\n\r\n217. DIANE DE POITIERS.\r\n\r\n  [Born 1499. Died at Arret, in France, 1566. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nAt 13, married Louis de Brézé, Grand Sénéchal of Normandy, who died in\r\n1531. At the age of 48 she became the favourite mistress of Henry II. of\r\nFrance. Her influence was used, except where she was herself biassed by\r\nreligious prejudices, invariably for good and commendable objects. Her\r\ntalents were commanding, and her beauty continued unimpaired by age. She\r\nwas created Duchess of Valentinois, and her power was well appreciated\r\nabroad. One of her daughters by De Brézé married the son of the Duc de\r\nGuise, afterwards Duc d’Aumâle.\r\n\r\n  [A portrait of the time.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETS AND DRAMATISTS.\r\n\r\n218. PIERRE CORNEILLE. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rouen, in France, 1606. Died in Paris, 1684. Aged 79.]\r\n\r\nThe father of French tragedy. Educated by the Jesuits. During the early\r\npart of his career, monastic exhibitions were the only dramatic\r\nperformances in vogue in France. When the French began to draw their\r\ndramatic inspirations from Spain, Corneille was the first to take real\r\nadvantage of the movement. He dramatized the first youthful achievement\r\nof the Cid with extraordinary success. It soon became the custom to say\r\nof anything deserving applause, that “it was as good as the Cid.” Then\r\nfollowed his drama of “Les Horaces,” considered a masterpiece of French\r\ntragedy, a species of composition which is not to be criticized by the\r\nrules that we apply to the great productions of our own stage. “Cinna”\r\nand “Polyeucte” followed, both efforts of undoubted genius. In 1642,\r\nelected member of the French Academy. The claims of Corneille upon our\r\nregard not to be over estimated. The French drama was yet in the block\r\nwhen he took up his artist tools. Grandeur of thought, elevation of\r\nsentiment, and heroism of character are wrought out in all his\r\nproductions, which have exercised a momentous influence upon succeeding\r\ntimes in France. Corneille was simple and almost rustic in his manners\r\nand appearance. Very proud, but very shy. Ambitious of glory, yet\r\ndisdaining the society of the great, even up to the greatest. He had a\r\ncommanding person, and expressive features. When he died he was poor,\r\nalmost to want. Napoleon had a lofty idea of Corneille’s knowledge of\r\ngovernment. “Had he lived in my time,” said the Emperor, “I should have\r\ntaken him into my council.”\r\n\r\n  [This is from the original marble, by Caffieri, in the Comédie\r\n  Française. There is a statue of him at Versailles done in 1836, by M.\r\n  Laitie. Both are taken from painted portraits.]\r\n\r\n219. JEAN DE ROTROU. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Dreux, in France, 1609. Died there, 1650, Aged 41.]\r\n\r\nOne of the creators of French tragedy. To him Corneille is indebted for\r\nthe idea of founding a tragedy upon the subject of the Cid--for it was\r\nat his instigation that the great master first looked to the Spanish\r\nstage for inspiration and guidance. Rotrou gloried in the success of\r\nCorneille, and generously maintained his superiority over all dramatic\r\nwriters in France--including himself. He left thirty-seven dramatic\r\npieces, and many of them exhibit power and great felicity of language.\r\nHe enjoyed a civil office in his native town, where he was much\r\nrespected. He was cut off by an epidemic.\r\n\r\n  [The original is in marble, by Caffieri. The costume is of the time of\r\n  Louis XIII.; but the bust must have been done from some painted\r\n  portrait, as it bears the date of 1783, and Caffieri was not born\r\n  until 1723.]\r\n\r\n220. JEAN DE LA FONTAINE. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Château Thierry, in France, 1621. Died in Paris, 1695. Aged\r\n  74.]\r\n\r\nA great French poet! His fables in verse, published when he was forty\r\nyears of age, placed him at once amongst the first writers in verse that\r\nFrance had produced, and created an epoch in French literature. As a\r\nwriter of fables he is probably not surpassed by any writer of any\r\ncountry. His life was full of vicissitudes. He succeeded his father, as\r\nKeeper of the Royal Domains at Château Thierry, but deserting both his\r\nwife and his occupation, he went to Paris, where he formed a lasting\r\nfriendship with Molière, Racine, and Boileau. A pension saved him from\r\nstarvation; and losing this with the fall of the Minister, Fouquet, who\r\ngave it, he was again rescued by the charity of Henrietta of England,\r\ndaughter of Charles I., and wife to the Duke of Orleans. Upon the death\r\nof this princess, he was again fortunately provided for by Madame de\r\nSablière, in whose house the poet lived for twenty years. In society, La\r\nFontaine was dull, silent, and subject to absence of mind. In his youth\r\nhe was remarkable for his aversion to poetry. He lies buried by the side\r\nof Molière, who ever regarded him with affection, and who discovered his\r\ngenius years before it was acknowledged by the world. His style is\r\neasy, sprightly, graceful, witty, pointed, and inimitably naïve.\r\n\r\n  [This is from the bust in terra cotta in the Théâtre Français, by\r\n  Caffieri. It has served as the authority for that by Dessine, at\r\n  Versailles, and the statue in the Vestibule of the Admirals, by M.\r\n  Seurre, done in 1837. Unfortunately, none of these could have been\r\n  modelled from the life.]\r\n\r\n220A. JEAN DE LA FONTAINE. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [By Auguste Dumont.]\r\n\r\n221. MOLIÈRE. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1622. Died there, 1673. Aged 51.]\r\n\r\nThe real name of Molière was Jean Baptiste Poquelin. That which is\r\nassociated with his renown was assumed when he became an actor, and\r\n“disgraced” his family, who cut Jean Baptiste away from the genealogical\r\ntree,--the father of Molière being _valet de chambre_ to Louis XIII.\r\nLike our own Shakspeare, Molière was an actor as well as a writer of\r\nplays. He forsook the study of the law for the stage, and at the age of\r\n24 was making his way in the provinces, where he produced comedies, in\r\nwhich he himself acted. In 1658, he returned to Paris, and by the favour\r\nof Louis XIV. opened the theatre of the Palais Royal. His new comedies\r\nproduced there attracted crowds. His latest work was “The Imaginary\r\nInvalid,” brought out in 1673. He played the principal part himself, and\r\nduring the fourth representation, was carried a dying man from the\r\nstage. The rites of Christian sepulture, denied, as a matter of course,\r\nto the player, were not conceded to the author who had satirized\r\nhypocrisy in his well-known comedy of “The Hypocrite.” Molière was\r\nbeloved by his contemporaries: he was generous and warm-hearted--the\r\nfriend of Condé, Boileau, and Racine. He is by far the first writer of\r\nComedy in modern times. His place is close to the side of Shakspeare,\r\nfor, like the English writer, he successfully addresses all countries\r\nand all ages, appealing to no limited, local, and accidental condition\r\nof the human mind, but striking home to the universal and unchangeable\r\nheart of man, as it everywhere throbs. Beyond the humorous faculty, he\r\npossessed earnestness of feeling, and a deep tone of passion. He was a\r\nman of tender heart; and of all French writers, he is the least French.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre.]\r\n\r\n222. THOMAS CORNEILLE. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rouen, 1625. Died at Andelys, 1709. Aged 84.]\r\n\r\nYounger brother of the great Corneille, with whom he lived until his\r\ndeath in brotherly affection. Inspired by his brother’s success, he\r\nearly devoted himself to dramatic composition, and, like his illustrious\r\nbrother borrowed from Spain the materials for his earliest attempts. The\r\nlabours of Thomas Corneille found even more approbation with\r\ncontemporary audiences than those of Pierre; but the majority of the\r\nyounger brother’s many comedies are now forgotten. The services rendered\r\nby Thomas to philology are perhaps more useful and lasting than his\r\ncontributions to the drama. He published a supplementary Dictionary to\r\nthat of the French Academy, and wrote other works. In his old age he\r\nlost his sight. He died honoured and beloved.\r\n\r\n  [By J. J. Caffieri, 1785. There is a copy of it at Versailles, in\r\n  marble, by M. Chenillion, dated 1836. The original was taken from an\r\n  authentic picture by Jouvenet, which belonged to the Countess of\r\n  Bouville, daughter of Corneille, a copy of which picture was given to\r\n  the Comédie Française by Caffieri.]\r\n\r\n223. PHILIPPE QUINAULT. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Felletin, in France, 1635. Died in Paris, 1688. Aged 53.]\r\n\r\nA lyrical poet of great reputation, and the most famous writer of French\r\noperas. His earliest works were tragedies and comedies, but in 1670,\r\nafter his election to the Royal Academy, he allied his verse to music,\r\nand did not sever the union until he altogether eschewed dramatic\r\ncomposition. He furnished to Lully, the musician, the words for his\r\nfirst opera, and continued to aid that composer until Lully’s death.\r\nTowards the close of his days, Quinault, influenced by religious\r\nscruples, ceased to write for the stage. His lyrical productions have\r\ngreat tenderness, and melodious sweetness, and are happily and eminently\r\nadapted to their alliance with the sister art.\r\n\r\n  [From a bust in terra cotta, by Caffieri, which was the model for that\r\n  in marble placed in the public room of the Opera, at Paris, and for\r\n  another in the Bibliothèque Généviève, at Paris.]\r\n\r\n224. NICOLAS BOILEAU. _Poet and Satirist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Crosne, in France, 1636. Died at Paris, 1711. Aged 75.]\r\n\r\nOne of the illustrious writers of his time. His labours went far to fix\r\nthe character and purity of the French language, and his sharp\r\ncriticisms have exercised ever since his day a salutary influence upon\r\nthe literature of his country. He ridiculed with singular acuteness the\r\nfalse taste of his generation, and endeavoured to point out the true\r\nprinciples of composition. His “Art Poétique” is considered by many, as\r\nrivalling the “Ars Poëtica” of Horace. His humorous and heroic poem of\r\n“Le Lutrin,” written to illustrate his theory that an epic ought to have\r\na slender groundwork, abounds in fanciful and sportive wit. He was the\r\nfriend of Molière, Racine, and Lafontaine, and the great Condé was his\r\npatron. A generous and charitable man, an upholder of religion, but a\r\nsworn hater of hypocrisy. Constant in his friendships, and always ready\r\nto forgive injuries.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble, by François Girardon, in the Louvre, a sculptor born\r\n  at Troyes, in Champagne, 1630, and died 1715.]\r\n\r\n225. JEAN RACINE. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at La Ferté Milon, in France, 1639. Died there, 1699. Aged 60.]\r\n\r\nRacine was the Euripides of France, as Corneille was her Æschylus. The\r\nfirst excelled in impassioned tenderness, the last in power and\r\nsublimity. Corneille borrowed from the Spanish stage; Racine took his\r\ninspiration from the ancients, whom he studied with ardour and effect.\r\nHe published “Phèdre,” one of his best tragedies, when he was\r\nthirty-eight years old, but, disgusted with the envy which he raised, he\r\nresolved to renounce the theatre ever afterwards. He did not keep his\r\nword; for some years later, at the request of Madame de Maintenon, he\r\nwrote his beautiful drama of “Athalie,” which, it would seem, was not\r\nappreciated at the time. His versification is sweet, expressive, and\r\nharmonious; and his plays are remarkable for grace and feeling. He was\r\nhimself beloved for his simplicity, modesty, and genuine character. He\r\nwas too sensitive to adverse criticism.\r\n\r\n226. JEAN FRANÇOIS REGNARD. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1655. Died at Dourdan, in France, 1709. Aged 54.]\r\n\r\nA celebrated comic writer of France, and a man of many adventures.\r\nReturning from an Italian journey, he was taken by pirates, and sold to\r\nslavery in Algiers. Whilst there he was sentenced to become a Mussulman,\r\nor to be burnt alive. Ransomed by the French Consul in 1681, he resumed\r\nhis travels northwards. In 1683, he took up his abode in Paris, and\r\nwrote comedies, which became very popular,--the most successful being\r\n“The Gamester,” produced in 1696. Regnard had an inexhaustible fund of\r\nhumour. Voltaire has said that “he who is not pleased with Regnard, is\r\nnot entitled to admire Molière.”\r\n\r\n  [In marble, by J. J. Foucon, signed and dated 1779. There is a copy of\r\n  this bust at Versailles.]\r\n\r\n227. CHARLES RIVIÈRE DUFRESNY. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1648. Died 1724. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nA versatile genius! A musician, a poet, a draughtsman, a gardener, and\r\nan architect. And most improvident withal! Was in the service of Louis\r\nXIV. first as valet-de-chambre, then as Inspector of the Royal Gardens.\r\nIn the latter capacity, he was the first to introduce the English style\r\nof gardening into France. He enjoyed a pension; but for an\r\ninconsiderable sum he sold both place and pension, and soon became\r\npenniless. Then took to writing for the theatre as a last resource for\r\nbread. Few of his plays met with, or deserved, success; but one or two\r\nhave recognised merit. He received fresh favours from the King, and the\r\nDuke of Orleans conferred upon him a handsome gift of money. But nothing\r\ncould save Dufresny from himself. He fell in his age into deep poverty,\r\nand so died.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by Augustin Pajou, signed and dated 1781. A sculptor\r\n  and professor in the Academy of Paris, and one of the best of his\r\n  time. He died in 1809.]\r\n\r\n228. PROSPER JOLYOT DE CRÉBILLON. _Dramatic Author._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Dijon, in France, 1674. Died in Paris, 1762. Aged 88.]\r\n\r\nStyled the _Æschylus_ of France. Educated by the Jesuits, and intended\r\nfor the law, he produced, in 1705, his first play, “Idomeneus.” A\r\nsubsequent effort, the tragedy of “Rhadamistus,” placed him at once in\r\nadvance of all the tragic poets who lingered on the stage after\r\nCorneille and Racine had quitted it. Disgusted, at a later period, with\r\nCourt neglect, and the decline of popularity, he withdrew from the\r\nworld, and passed a life of abstinence amidst a large number of cats and\r\ndogs, whose attachment, he said, consoled him for man’s ingratitude. In\r\n1731, elected a member of the French Academy. Towards the close of his\r\ndays the sun once more smiled upon his fortunes. He received a pension\r\nthrough Madame Pompadour of 2,400 French livres; and the King of France\r\ncaused his works to be printed at the Louvre press. As a tragic author\r\nhe takes high rank. Too fond of dealing in horrors, but all his works\r\nhave warmth, energy, and varied action. He was proud, independent, and\r\nalive to his own defects.\r\n\r\n  [The marble bust from which this was taken was executed after a model\r\n  from the life, by the celebrated sculptor, J. B. Lemoyne, in 1760. The\r\n  marble was carved by J. B. Huez, in 1778, as the inscription tells us.\r\n  The only notice of Huez, who has often been considered the author of\r\n  the bust, is in “Les Salons” of Diderot, where he is mentioned amongst\r\n  the contributors to the exhibitions of the day, and not in\r\n  complimentary terms. Lemoyne was a Parisian, and died in 1778. He did\r\n  many busts.]\r\n\r\n229. PHILIPPE NÉRICAULT DESTOUCHES. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Tours, in France, 1680. Died 1754. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nIn his youth served as a volunteer in the French army. Then adjoined to\r\nthe embassy in Switzerland, where his leisure enabled him to follow the\r\nbent of his fancy, and to write for the stage. His plays were as popular\r\nas his diplomatic skill proved useful. He found favour with the Duke of\r\nOrleans, who attached him to the mission of Dubois, when that minister,\r\nin 1717, went to London. His diplomacy still pleased the Regent, who,\r\nunfortunately, died too soon for Destouches. But the dramatist had been\r\nprudent; and upon the death of his patron, he retired with a sufficient\r\nfortune to his estate, and sought consolation in the pursuits of\r\nagriculture and philosophy. His plays won applause rather by the\r\ninteresting situations of which they were full, than by subtle\r\ndevelopment of character.\r\n\r\n  [From the only bust of him, by P. F. Berruer, done in 1781 and signed.\r\n  Berruer was a member of the Paris Academy, and died in 1797.]\r\n\r\n230. ALAIN RÉNÉ LE SAGE. _Novelist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Sarzeau, in France, 1683. Died at Boulogne-sur-Mer, 1741.\r\n  Aged 58.]\r\n\r\nThe author of “Gil Blas” and the “Devil on Two Sticks.” A poor man,\r\nnotwithstanding the success of his novels. Becoming deaf, he used a\r\nspeaking-trumpet in the presence of intelligent visitors; when other\r\nvisitors came to him he gravely put the instrument into his pocket. An\r\ninimitable painter of human nature, ranking with the few immortals whose\r\ncreations appeal to all times. Proud and independent, though amiable of\r\ndisposition. Devoted to the pursuits and joys of a literary life.\r\n\r\n231. ALEXIS PIRON. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Dijon, 1689. Died 1773. Aged 84.]\r\n\r\nA wild and dissolute spirit. The author of one admirable comedy, “La\r\nMétromanie,” which may take rank with the dramatic productions of the\r\nbest period in France, and of seven volumes of compositions which have\r\nlong ceased to float on the broad river of fame. Piron was the son of an\r\napothecary at Dijon, and after almost breaking his father’s heart by his\r\nfollies, he was obliged to flee his native town in consequence of the\r\npublication of an indecorous effusion written amidst the fumes of an\r\norgie. He went to Paris, and there for nine years lived in great\r\nindigence, supporting himself as a copyist. Then he took to writing for\r\nthe minor theatres, with more or less success, until 1738, when he\r\nproduced his masterpiece, already mentioned. It secured him a place at\r\nonce amongst the best dramatists of his country. In 1753, he applied for\r\na vacant seat in the Academy, and was refused. He revenged himself by\r\ncomposing a satire and the following epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    “Ci-git Piron, qui ne fut rien,\r\n     Pas même Académicien.”\r\n\r\n    “Here lies Piron--a nullity--\r\n     Not even an Academician.”\r\n\r\n  [This is an admirable bust, by Caffieri, dated 1775. Copied at\r\n  Versailles by M. Pigalle.]\r\n\r\n232. PIERRE CLAUDE NIVELLE DE LA CHAUSSÉE. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1692. Died there, 1754. Aged 62.]\r\n\r\nHe is regarded as the inventor of sentimental comedy in France\r\n(_Comédie larmoyante_.) Hugh Kelly’s “False Delicacy” made the\r\ninvention known in England, and Foote’s “Piety in Pattens” ridiculed it.\r\nPierre de la Chaussée was a French Academician. His writings gained for\r\nhim considerable fame during his life, and La Harpe ranks him amongst\r\nthe authors who have conferred honour upon the French theatre.\r\n\r\n  [In marble, by Caffieri. 1785.]\r\n\r\n233. FRANÇOIS MARIE AROUET DE VOLTAIRE. _Historian, Poet, and Wit._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Chatenay, in France, 1694. Died in Paris, 1778. Aged 84.]\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary Intellect was not, as is generally supposed, an\r\natheist. Voltaire was not destitute of the sense of moral\r\nresponsibility; and he hardly believed in the immortality of the soul;\r\nbut it was from his pen that fell the startling confession that, “if God\r\ndid not exist, it would be necessary to invent his being.” Voltaire was\r\nrichly endowed. He wrote the best epic poem in the French language; his\r\ntragedies, full of strength and passion, take high rank; his satire is\r\ncutting and inimitable, and his historical writings are full of life and\r\nmovement. Wrapt up, however, in the philosophical spirit of the\r\neighteenth century, he was ever incapable of judging justly of the\r\ngreatness of minds who had received the prejudices of less enlightened\r\ntimes. For forty years, he led a life of incessant literary action: part\r\nof that time he was forced, in consequence of his satirical writings, to\r\nlive in England, where he became the intimate of Bolingbroke, Toland,\r\nand other deists. In 1749, he visited Berlin, on the invitation of\r\nFrederic the Great. Always a persevering and acrimonious enemy of\r\nChristianity, he laughed at Revelation; and, a sneerer at hereditary\r\norders, he helped largely to the overthrow of the monarchy in France. He\r\ndid not live to witness the Revolution; but it is said that he lived\r\nlong enough to be horrified at his infidelity. It must be noted to his\r\nhonour, that whilst he ridiculed all things in which he had no faith, he\r\nwas sincere in his maintenance of the rights of humanity, and in his\r\ndenunciations of injustice. He was the idol of all who read and talked\r\nin France in his time.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble, by Houdon, done in 1778, and signed by him in the\r\n  Théâtre Français. There is a fine seated statue of Voltaire in the\r\n  Théâtre Français by Houdon considered to be his _chef-d’œuvre_ as a\r\n  portrait statue, and remarkable for the noble style in which the\r\n  subject is treated. Copies of the same bust and statue exist at\r\n  Versailles.]\r\n\r\n233A. FRANÇOIS MARIE AROUET DE VOLTAIRE. _Historian, Poet, and Wit._\r\n\r\n  [By Pajou.]\r\n\r\n234. MICHEL JEAN SEDAINE. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1719. Died there, 1797. Aged 78.]\r\n\r\nThe son of an architect. At the age of 13 relinquished, through poverty,\r\nthe study of architecture and became a journeyman mason. Later in life\r\nhe set up as master mason, but he forsook his calling for literature and\r\nthe drama. His plays are well written for stage effect, but are not\r\nremarkable for their poetic character, or correctness of style. The\r\nsuccess of his play, “Richard Cœur de Lion,” procured him admission into\r\nthe French Academy.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble, by Jaques Edouard Gatteaux, signed and dated 1843.

CHARLES PALISSOT DE MONTENOY. _Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Nancy, in France, 1730. Died, 1814.

In 1760, he produced\r\nhis comedy of “Les Philosophes;” in 1764, the “Dunciade.” His works are\r\nnot distinguished by richness of invention or copiousness of ideas; but\r\nhis style is natural, easy and correct.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n235. MARIE JEANNE VAUBERNIER, COMTESSE DU BARRY.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Vaucouleurs, in France, 1746. Guillotined, 1793. Aged 47.]\r\n\r\nOf humble parentage. Quitting a convent in Paris into which she had\r\nentered at an early age, she worked as a milliner when fifteen years\r\nold. Shortly afterwards she became the mistress of the Count du Barry, a\r\ndissolute man of fashion, and by him was introduced to Louis XV., who\r\ncaptivated by her beauty and unrestrained manners, induced the brother\r\nof the Count to make Mademoiselle Vaubernier his lawful wife. La\r\nComtesse du Barry, received at Versailles, soon acquired an ascendancy\r\nover the licentious monarch and his court. She exercised supreme sway,\r\nand held in her hands the power of life and death--promotion and\r\ndisgrace. Her extravagance was boundless. At the death of Louis in 1774,\r\nshe was shut up in a convent, where she became religious. Released from\r\nher imprisonment by Louis XVI., she conducted herself with decorum, but\r\ntoo late for any earthly happiness she might derive from repentance. In\r\n1793, the revolutionists took her life because she had devoted it to the\r\nservice of the Royal family, for whom, it would appear, she had sold her\r\ndiamonds. She was much pitied at the scaffold, where she betrayed great\r\nwant of courage.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Pajou. A very beautiful work\r\n  delicately chiselled, and full of life and softness. It is signed and\r\n  dated 1772.

MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE. _Essayist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at the Castle of Montaigne, in Perigord, France, 1533. Died at\r\n  Perigord, 1592. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nAn original and most engaging writer. His essays consist chiefly either\r\nof personal narrative, or of disquisitions upon his individual nature.\r\nHis reasoning acute and philosophical, his manner, if one may so call\r\nit, grotesque, and naïve. His descriptions of persons, events, and\r\nplaces full of life and exquisite drawing. A favourite author with all\r\nlovers of sterling thought, lucid style, and quaint reflection. He lived\r\nduring a time of religious conflict, but walked quietly and unscathed\r\nthrough the fire, blessed with philosophic calm. He travelled in 1580,\r\nvisited Switzerland and Venice “which he had a hunger to see,” and\r\nsettled for a time in Rome. He said “he could not go out of his way, for\r\nhe had no way to go.” On his return, elected Mayor of Bordeaux, though\r\nhe told the electors he had “neither party-spirit, memory, diligence,\r\nnor experience.” Elected for a second time to the office, nevertheless.\r\nA man of great moral courage, and warm in his friendships.\r\n\r\n237. JACQUES AUGUSTE DE THOU. _Minister of State and Historian._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris 1553. Died 1617. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nUnder Henry III. of France, De Thou discharged the duties of several\r\noffices with eminent ability and credit; and in 1581, was appointed one\r\nof the commissioners, sent to quiet the disturbances in Guyenne. In\r\n1588, he was nominated Councillor of State, and in the following years\r\nproceeded to Germany and Italy on a diplomatic mission. On the death of\r\nHenry III. he received the confidence of Henry IV., and was employed,\r\nwith others, to digest the articles set forth in the celebrated Edict of\r\nNantes in 1598. In 1591, he commenced his great history of his own\r\ntimes; and, in 1604, published the first eighteen books. After the death\r\nof Henry IV., he served for a time as one of the Directors of Finance in\r\nSully’s place, but soon retired, disappointed and vexed; and closed his\r\ndays in the completion of his magnificent historical labours, and in the\r\npractice of piety. De Thou was deeply read in men, and learned in human\r\ndealings; grave and severely simple. His mighty work was written in 138\r\nbooks, in the purest Latin, and is one of the world’s monuments of\r\nindustry, intelligence, and knowledge. He also wrote Latin verses.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Barthélemi Prieur. The head is in\r\n  white marble, and the body in porphyry to imitate his robe.]\r\n\r\n238. RÉNÉ DESCARTES. _Mathematician and Metaphysician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Touraine, in France, 1596. Died at Stockholm, in Sweden,\r\n  1650. Aged 54.]\r\n\r\nShares with Bacon the title of Father of Modern Philosophy. All the\r\nmetaphysical writers follow him, as the men of the physical sciences\r\nfollow Bacon. He was only three and twenty when, whilst with his\r\nregiment on the Danube, he determined to reform philosophy. To do so, he\r\nresolved to efface from his mind all that he had learnt, and to admit\r\nnothing that could not be demonstrated by reason and experience. With\r\nhim, consciousness was the sole _basis_, mathematics the sole _method_,\r\nof certainty. He substituted the philosophy of reason for that of\r\nauthority. His genius for the great sciences, and his superiority over\r\nthe majority of his contemporaries in scientific acquirements, were\r\nremarkable. He first applied algebra to geometry; he likewise made\r\nobservations on the decline of the magnetic needle, put forward the true\r\ntheory of the rainbow, and brought the science of optics within the\r\ndomain of mathematics. His influence over his age was great, though his\r\nwritings involved him in controversies. But he was timid as a man. He\r\nwrote a book on astronomy, but destroyed it on learning the fate of\r\nGalileo. He was the first great master of French prose. It is said of\r\nhim, that he began by doubting everything, and ended by believing that\r\nhe had left nothing unexplained.\r\n\r\n239. ANTOINE ARNAULD. _Theologian and Controversialist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1612. Died at Brussels, 1694. Aged 82.]\r\n\r\nA learned and fierce polemic, whose consistency was as perfect as his\r\nspirit was bitter, and whose defiance of conflict and danger was as\r\ninsolent as his private life was blameless. His happiness consisted in\r\nspiritual warfare. He established himself spokesman of the Jansenists.\r\nWhen he was ten years old he was heard to say to Cardinal Perron, “With\r\nthis pen I, like you, will write against the Huguenots.” He commenced\r\nthe labours of his life by an attack upon the Jesuits. Taking active\r\npart in all the angry discussion respecting grace, he published two\r\n“Apologies” in favour of Jansenius, which drew upon him the censure of\r\nthe Sorbonne, and compelled him to retire to Port Royal, where he\r\nremained for the space of twelve years. Returning to Paris in 1668, he\r\nplunged immediately into the seething waters of controversy, and was\r\nagain forced into exile. Fifteen years afterwards, we find him, as\r\nfurious as ever, attacking the doctrine of Malebranche respecting the\r\ngrace and vision of God. At his own request, his much-agitated heart,\r\nafter it had ceased to beat, was sent to be deposited in the Port Royal.\r\nForty-eight volumes remain to attest the intensity of his religious\r\nprejudices, the depth and extent of his learning, his violent love of\r\nwrangling, and his restless and unwearied industry. We sigh over the\r\nwaste of power and the misuse of fine material.\r\n\r\n240. SÉBASTIEN LE PRESTRE DE VAUBAN. _Engineer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at St.-Léger de Foucheret, in Burgundy, 1633. Died 1707. Aged\r\n  74.]\r\n\r\nOf poor parents, but well descended. At the age of seventeen, entered\r\nthe army of Condé, in Spain, then fighting against France. Taken\r\nprisoner in 1653, he went over to the French army, and received his\r\ncommission as lieutenant of engineers. His rise was as rapid as his\r\nservices were great. At the age of twenty-five, he conducted the sieges\r\nof Gravelines, Ypres, and Oudenarde. He gave the most valuable help in\r\nall the campaigns of Holland and Flanders, from 1667 to 1703; and in\r\n1703 was created Marshal of France. His contributions to the science of\r\nfortification have celebrated his name. He was not only a great builder,\r\nbut a shrewd observer, and knew better than any of his contemporaries\r\nhow to avail himself, whether in defence, or in attack, of the\r\ncircumstances by which he was surrounded, and of the opportunities and\r\nconditions of his time. To him we owe the system of parallel lines,\r\nwhich he introduced before the city of Maestricht. At the siege of\r\nPhilisbourg, he invented the “tir à ricochet,” in which the ball, making\r\na series of bounds, strikes several times along works against which it\r\nis directed. He also invented the musket, in which the match served in\r\nlieu of the cover to the pan. He afterwards armed the musket with the\r\nbayonet. He vastly improved the system of inundations, that most useful\r\nelement of self-defence. His engineering appliances during his long and\r\nindefatigable service were inexhaustible. It is affirmed on authority,\r\nthat he repaired three hundred old fortresses, constructed thirty-three\r\nnew works, conducted fifty-three sieges, and was present at a hundred\r\nand forty severe engagements. He also left behind him twelve folio\r\nvolumes on Strategetics, entitled “Idle Hours.” Vauban was beloved by\r\nthe soldiery, for whose safety he was always careful. His humanity is\r\notherwise known by his endeavour to procure from the king, his master,\r\nthe restoration of the Edict of Nantes. To that king he was deeply\r\nattached; although to him, as well as to every other man, he was blunt\r\nin the expression of what he believed to be truth,--straightforward and\r\nmanly. He has been called the prince of engineers, and the best of\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n241. JOSEPH PITTON DE TOURNEFORT. _Botanist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Aix, in Provence, 1656. Died 1708. Aged 52.]\r\n\r\nEducated by the Jesuits, and intended originally for the Church; but\r\nupon the death of his father he made several botanical excursions, and\r\nfinally devoted his days to the prosecution of his darling pursuit. He\r\nvisited England, Spain, and Holland. Tournefort did much towards the\r\nfoundation of a scientific botany. His special service was in\r\ndistinguishing plants from one another, and in preparing them by\r\nclassification for the handling of the more philosophic student. Like\r\nthe other botanists of his time, he had his own system of\r\nclassification. He was one of the first thinkers upon the geographical\r\ndistribution of plants. In 1700, he pursued his inquiries in the Levant,\r\nwhence he brought home, after protracted and perilous wandering, no\r\nfewer than 1356 new plants. He published his “Travels in the Levant”\r\nupon his return to France.\r\n\r\n242. CHARLES ROLLIN. _Historian._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1661. Died 1741. Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a cutler, and himself intended for that trade; but rescued to\r\nlearning and literature by a Benedictine monk who placed him at the\r\nCollege of Plessis. His studies were eminently successful. After holding\r\nmany high scholastic appointments in France, he was obliged to resign,\r\nin 1720, the Rectorship of the College of Plessis, where he had been\r\nbrought up, in consequence of the religious troubles of the time, he\r\nbeing suspected of favouring the Jansenists. From 1720 until his death,\r\noccupied in literary labours. His “Ancient History” appeared at\r\nintervals, from 1730 to 1738. Its simple style and moral tendency are\r\nmore to be admired than the exactness of its narrative and the\r\ndiscernment of its author. The other writings of Rollin improved the\r\ntaste of his age, and certainly strengthened its moral tone. As Rector\r\nof the University he revived the study of Greek, and gave prominence to\r\nthe cultivation of French. He corresponded with Frederic the Great,\r\nRousseau, and Voltaire, without deriving injury from their acquaintance:\r\nfor all his contemporaries describe him as singularly virtuous and\r\npious.\r\n\r\n243. JEAN BAPTISTE ROUSSEAU. _Lyric Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1669. Died at Brussels, 1741. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nA lyric poet of great celebrity in France, but many of his compositions\r\ndefaced by scurrility and indecency. He was the son of a shoemaker, but\r\nhe received a good education, and at an early age, gave sign of his\r\npoetic genius. In his nineteenth year, appointed page to the French\r\nambassador at the court of Denmark; and subsequently attached as\r\nSecretary to the Embassy in England. In 1712, he fell into disfavour,\r\nand was banished from France for writing libellous verses, which, to the\r\nlast moment of his life, he declared were the production of some enemy,\r\nwho had designed his ruin. Retiring to Vienna, he found favour with\r\nPrince Eugene. The odes of Jean Baptiste Rousseau are not surpassed, if\r\nthey are equalled, in the French language; his lyrics are elegant and\r\nharmonious, and his epigrammatic skill is perfect. His later\r\nproductions, however, exhibit a lamentable falling off from the early\r\nexcellence by which he won his fame.\r\n\r\n  [In marble, by Caffieri. No date.]\r\n\r\n244. RÉNÉ ANTOINE FERCHAULT DE RÉAUMUR. _Chemist and Naturalist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rochelle, in France, 1683. Died at Maine, in France, 1757.\r\n  Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nThe discoverer, in his own country, of the art of making steel, till\r\nthen imported into France. The thermometer which he adjusted, and which\r\nis named after him, is chiefly used on the continent. His life spent in\r\nthe service of science, and in the close pursuit of truth. Entomology\r\nwas, however, his favourite study; and he contributed a most interesting\r\nmemoir towards the history of insects. He died from the effects of a\r\nfall from his horse.\r\n\r\n245. GEORGES LOUIS LE CLERC, COMTE DE BUFFON. _Naturalist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Montbard, in France, 1707. Died in Paris, 1788. Aged 81.]\r\n\r\nThis great naturalist commenced his scientific career at the age of 25,\r\nand his study at Montbard was called by Prince Henry of Prussia “the\r\ncradle of Natural History.” Shortly afterwards appointed Intendant to\r\nthe _Jardin des Plantes_ at Paris, where he projected his theory of the\r\nclassification of animals, and assisted by Daubenton and Lacépède, wrote\r\nthe great work which has immortalized his name. He was more or less\r\ndissimilar to Linnæus in the spirit and in the detail of his\r\nundertaking. Buffon’s object is to write a natural history of each\r\nanimal; that of Linnæus to express its peculiar and distinctive\r\ncharacter in the fewest possible words. Linnæus gives classical names to\r\nthe objects he describes. Buffon names his animals in French. Buffon’s\r\nstyle is luminous and elevated, and at times approaches the character of\r\nblank verse. He is one of the founders of ethnological science, and as a\r\nwriter on ethnology gave great prominence to the history of man as an\r\nAnimal. He was sensual, vain, and in religious matters hypocritical.\r\n\r\n  [The original bust, which is in the Louvre, is inscribed--“By Pajou,\r\n  sculpteur du Roy, professeur de son Académie de peinture et de\r\n  sculpture, 1773.” Pajou died in 1809.]\r\n\r\n245A. GEORGES LOUIS LE CLERC, COMTE DE BUFFON. _Naturalist._\r\n\r\n  [By J. Debay.]\r\n\r\n246. CHARLES LINNÉ, known by his Latin name LINNÆUS. _Botanist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rœshult, in Sweden, 1707. Died at Upsal, in Sweden, 1778.\r\n  Aged 71.]\r\n\r\nA botanist, even at school, where he neglected his books in order to\r\ncollect plants in the fields. His father, in despair, apprenticed him to\r\na shoemaker. With eight pounds in his pocket, he went to Upsal, to study\r\nfor the medical profession. Here he was appointed botanical lecturer in\r\nthe University. Thence he was despatched to Lapland on a botanical\r\nexpedition, and it is said he travelled 3,500 miles with no more than\r\nten pounds. Finally became Professor of Medicine at Upsal, and\r\nSuperintendent of the Botanical Gardens. Published, besides his great\r\n_Systema Naturæ_, many works on natural history, and a book on _Materia\r\nMedica_ and nosology. He invented a new system of classification,\r\nfounded upon the sexes of plants, which reigned in the science till\r\nsuperseded by the natural system of Jussieu. In person below the middle\r\nheight, strong, and muscular. His head large; his look ardent and\r\npiercing; his features agreeable and animated. Vanity his greatest\r\nfoible; yet few men have shown greater boldness, zeal, and activity, in\r\nthe pursuit of science. His love of nature seemed a religious devotion\r\nof the heart. His library and _herbarium_ were purchased for 1000_l._ by\r\nSir James Edward Smith, and are now in the possession of the Linnæan\r\nSociety of London.\r\n\r\n247. JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU. _Philosopher and Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Geneva, 1712. Died at Ermenonville, in France, 1778. Aged\r\n  66.]\r\n\r\nThis singular and morally-distempered man, was endowed by nature with a\r\nwarm imagination, a teeming fancy, and ardent feeling; but his whole\r\nnature was unhinged, by the absence of conscientiousness and directing\r\nprinciple. He was not only self-loving and vain, but self-engrossed. His\r\nearly life was passed in reading romances, and in the loose indulgence\r\nof his weaknesses and passions. Yet his pen was a potent one, and, even\r\nmore than that of Voltaire, helped to bring about the Revolution in\r\nFrance, and all its social blasphemies. Whilst Voltaire, with his bright\r\nand sharpened wit, cut away the cable that held religion to its\r\nmoorings, Rousseau penetrated to the households of men, invaded their\r\nfiresides, and poisoned their hearts. His writings were new,\r\nfascinating, and eloquent; abounding in highly-wrought descriptions of\r\nnature, and in what seemed genuine bursts of passion. His philosophy\r\nattributed all vices to civilization, to the existence of property, and\r\nto the tyranny of governments. His career was as disgraceful to himself,\r\nas his works proved detrimental to the happiness of others. He committed\r\nfrequent thefts in his youth, and behaved with infamous ingratitude\r\ntowards his benefactress, Madame de Warens, who saved him from\r\nthreatened starvation; yet was left by him to starve in later days, when\r\nthe condition in life of both had changed. With all his profound\r\nsentiment, Rousseau was a cold-blooded and cruel man. He was a subtle,\r\nindependent, and original inquirer.\r\n\r\n  [From the bronze in the Louvre which bears the name of Houdon, 1778.\r\n  The treatment is in the antique manner. The drapery is a mantle, and\r\n  the head is bound with a fillet. This bust has an especial interest,\r\n  from its having been executed from a cast taken after death by Houdon,\r\n  who was sent for to Ermenonville immediately after the decease of\r\n  Rousseau, by M. de Girardin, with whom he lived. The original cast\r\n  still exists, and shows its genuineness by the scar on the forehead,\r\n  caused by Rousseau’s falling from his chair; an accident which gave\r\n  rise to the report that he had shot himself.]\r\n\r\n247*. JEAN DARCET. _Chemist and Physician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Douazit, in France, 1725. Died in Paris, 1801. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nDisinherited by his father for preferring the study of natural\r\nphilosophy to that of jurisprudence; but befriended by Montesquieu, who\r\nappointed him tutor to his sons. His great discovery was the composition\r\nof porcelain. He artificially formed from minerals, found in France, the\r\nearth of which porcelain is made, and which exists in a natural state in\r\nSaxony, where the law forbade its exportation. The first to extract\r\ngelatine from bones, and soda from the sea water. Director of the\r\nGobelins and of the Sèvres manufactories.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n248. JEAN PIERRE DUHAMEL. _Man of Science._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Nicorps, in France, 1730. Died 1816. Aged 86.]\r\n\r\nIn 1752, Duhamel visited the mines of the Pyrenees, and of various parts\r\nof Germany, in order to collect information, his object being to\r\nestablish a School of Mines in his own country. But he had to wait\r\ntwenty years for the realization of his idea. As soon as it was carried\r\nout, he received the appointment of Professor of Agriculture and\r\nMetallurgy. He was a true practical philosopher, and his inventions and\r\ndiscoveries were all of the highest use in the branch of science to the\r\ndevelopment of which his life-long exertions had been directed.\r\n\r\n249. JOSEPH LOUIS LAGRANGE. _Astronomer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Turin, in Italy, 1736. Died in Paris, 1813. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nAt the age of 19, was Professor of Mathematics at the College of Turin.\r\nAppointed successor to Euler when the latter was removed from Berlin.\r\nSubsequently settled in Paris, where he became one of the Directors of\r\nthe Mint, and Professor in the Polytechnic school. In 1793, when all\r\nforeigners were ordered to leave France, he was permitted to remain. His\r\nimportant labours contributed largely to the advancement of mathematics\r\nand astronomy, agitating most of the problems which Laplace subsequently\r\ntreated with such success. Delicate in health, he led a temperate life;\r\nand in society he was reserved and contemplative. Neither great fame nor\r\nhigh honour impaired his modesty. One of the Encyclopedists.\r\n\r\n250. JEAN FRANÇOIS GALAUP DE LA PÉROUSE. _Navigator._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Albi, in France, 1741. Died about 1788.]\r\n\r\nAt an early age entered the naval service of his country, and in 1782\r\ncommanded the successful attempt to destroy the English settlement at\r\nHudson’s Bay: an attack in which he displayed great humanity towards the\r\nfoe. In 1785, he quitted France with two small frigates on a voyage of\r\ndiscovery. He visited the coasts of Tartary, Japan, and New Holland; in\r\n1787, he sent home one of his officers with an account of his\r\nexpedition; and in 1788, he quitted Botany Bay. No further intelligence\r\nwas ever received of him or of any of his crew. He probably perished on\r\none of the Vanikors islands.\r\n\r\n250*. MARIE-JEAN-ANTOINE NICOLAS CARÉTAT, MARQUIS DE CONDORCET.\r\n_Mathematician and Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Picardy, France, 1743. Died at Clamart, in France, 1794. Aged\r\n  51.]\r\n\r\nOne of the original thinkers of the eighteenth century, and the\r\nbiographer of Voltaire. Cold and reserved in his manner, but his\r\nfeelings warm and enthusiastic. D’Alembert called him “a volcano covered\r\nwith snow.” Another writer has said that goodness was so sweetly\r\nexpressed in his eyes, that had he proved dishonest, he would have been\r\nmore to blame than any other man. He earned and still retains the name\r\nof the “virtuous Condorcet.” His scientific attainments caused him to be\r\nelected Secretary to the Academy of Sciences at an early age. His works,\r\nwhich are in 21 vols., were collected by Cabanis and Garat. The work on\r\nwhich his fame will rest is the _Esquisse d’un tableau Historique des\r\nprogrès de l’esprit Humain_, where, for the first time, the idea of\r\nProgress as a law of Humanity was scientifically expounded. Condorcet\r\nbelieved in the indefinite perfectibility of man as the result of this\r\nlaw of progress. In 1791, inflamed with the zeal which he had helped to\r\nkindle for liberty, and the overthrow of inveterate abuses, he became a\r\nmember of the National Assembly, but not proving violent enough for his\r\ncolleagues, was forced to secrete himself in the house of a friend.\r\nDeath being pronounced against all who should harbour proscribed\r\npersons, Condorcet voluntarily quitted his sanctuary in disguise; but\r\nwas detected in the village of Clermont, and thrown into prison. He\r\nswallowed poison, and was found dead on the following morning. In\r\naction, Condorcet wanted moral courage.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n251. JACQUES ÉTIENNE MONTGOLFIER. _Aëronaut, and Inventor of Balloons._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Vidalon-lès-Annonai, in France, 1745. Died at Serrières, in\r\n  France, 1799. Aged 54.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a paper-maker. Was led by reading the philosophical writings\r\nof Priestley to conceive the idea of employing gas, lighter than the\r\natmosphere, as a means of ascending through the air. His first\r\nexperiment was made at Annonai in 1783, and with such success that he\r\nrepeated it the same year in Paris, and again at Versailles before the\r\nCourt. Montgolfier was rewarded for his invention by admission to the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, the cordon of St. Michel, and a pension of 2000\r\nlivres.\r\n\r\n251*. GASPAR MONGE. _Geometrician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Beaunée, in France, 1746. Died in Paris, 1818. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nInventor of descriptive geometry, and one of the founders of the\r\nPolytechnic School at Paris. During the Revolution elected Minister of\r\nMarine but soon resigning, took a personally active part in the\r\nequipment of the army for war. Under Napoleon, visited Egypt, where his\r\ninvestigations of architectural remains were incessant. His whole life\r\ndevoted to science; and his work on the history of Mathematics testifies\r\nto his deep spirit of research. An impartial writer, but a praiser of\r\nfew.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n252. DOMINIQUE DENON. _Egyptian Traveller._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Chalons-sur-Saone, in France, 1747. Died in Paris, 1825. Aged\r\n  78.]\r\n\r\nBrought up to the law, he neglected his profession for the fine arts.\r\nFound favour with Louis XV. and his successor. Fulfilled several\r\ndiplomatic appointments with great success. In 1787, became a member of\r\nthe Academy of Painters. Employed by Robespierre to design the new\r\nrepublican official costumes. Accompanied the French expedition to\r\nEgypt; of which one result was his interesting and magnificent work,\r\npublished at the public expense, “Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt,\r\nduring the campaigns of General Buonaparte.” This work first brought the\r\nwonderful remains of ancient Egyptian art distinctly before our eyes.\r\nSubsequently appointed, by Napoleon, Director-General of Museums, and\r\nmainly organized in Paris the admirable collection which for a time\r\nconstituted the richest treasury of art ever known in Europe. At the\r\nRestoration, Denon lost his office, and devoted his leisure to the\r\narrangement of his own museum. He was an ardent lover of the fine arts,\r\npossessed an elegant taste and liberal mind.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by M. Marin. 1827.]\r\n\r\n252*. CLAUDE LOUIS BERTHOLLET. _Chemist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Talloire, in Savoy, 1748. Died at Arcueil, in France, 1822.\r\n  Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nAfter studying at Turin, went to Paris. There elected a member of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, and Professor of Chemistry to the Normal and\r\nPolytechnic Schools. During the first wars of the Revolution employed in\r\nmaking gunpowder, and converting iron into steel. With Monge, the\r\ngeometrician, accompanied the French army to Italy and Egypt in order to\r\ndirect the removal of the plundered works of art. The friendship of\r\nthese two philosophers, their calmness in pursuing science amidst\r\ndanger, their courage and kindness to the soldiers, won for them the\r\nadmiration of the whole army. Berthollet discovered the bleaching\r\nproperties of chlorine, and the art of fixing the colour of dyes. Also\r\nassisted in the establishment of a new chemical nomenclature. Generous,\r\ndisinterested, heroic; and his modesty equal to his merit.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n253. ANTOINE LAURENT DE JUSSIEU. _Botanist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Lyons, 1748. Died in Paris, 1836. Aged 88.]\r\n\r\nOne of a celebrated family of botanists; his uncle Bernard, who died in\r\n1777, having been one of the foremost botanists of his age. His most\r\nfamous work, founded upon his uncle’s great labours, was “The Varieties\r\nof Plants, arranged according to their Natural Order.” His whole\r\nscientific life was spent in an endeavour to ascertain the natural\r\nrelations of plants, and, by the aid of fresh discoveries, to justify\r\nand complete the system he upheld.\r\n\r\n253*. PIERRE SIMON LAPLACE. _Astronomer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Beaumont, in France, 1749. Died in Paris, 1827. Aged 78.]\r\n\r\nA great geometrician and physical astronomer. To him we owe the Theory\r\nof Probabilities, and the _Nebular Hypothesis_. He also prepared the way\r\nfor the Theory of Tides. He discovered the existence of an invariable\r\nplane in the solar system. Invented a thermometer. His great work,\r\n_Mécanique céleste_, introduced to the English by Mrs. Somerville in her\r\n“Mechanism of the Heavens,” is so complete that no alterations of\r\nimportance have been made by subsequent discovery.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n254. JEAN ANTOINE CHAPTAL. _Chemist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Nogaret, in France, 1756. Died in Paris, 1832. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nAs a chemist eminent for making the science subservient to the uses of\r\nmanufacture. In 1800, elected Minister of State. In 1802, presented to\r\nthe State a scheme for education which embodied Napoleon’s educational\r\nmeasures. Curious to say, the scheme betrayed a distrust of general\r\neducation altogether, and an anxiety to train up youth in the interest\r\nof the government. An able statesman, but in science a practical\r\nphilosopher, rather than a brilliant discoverer.\r\n\r\n255. BERNARD GERMAIN ÉTIENNE LACÉPÈDE, COMTE DE LA VILLE SUR ILLON.\r\n_Naturalist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Agen, in France, 1756. Died at Epinay, in France, 1825. Aged\r\n  69.]\r\n\r\nWhen young, in the army; but quitted it for the study of Natural\r\nHistory. The favorite pupil of Buffon, who obtained for him the\r\nappointment of Curator to the king, and selected him to continue his\r\nNatural History. His works display profound research, and are elegantly\r\nwritten. A courteous and kind-hearted man.\r\n\r\n255*. ANTOINE ISAAC SILVESTRE, BARON DE SACY. _Orientalist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1758. Died there, 1838. Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of modern linguists, he made himself master, not\r\nonly of all the classical and modern languages of Europe, but of many of\r\nthe languages of the East. His industry was remarkable. In 1806, he was\r\nappointed Professor of Persian. In 1810, he published an Arabic\r\ngrammar. In 1832, he was raised to the peerage, and made keeper of the\r\nOriental MSS. in the king’s library. De Sacy was the chief founder and\r\nfirst President of the Asiatic Society in Paris, and besides extending\r\nin his country the knowledge of every branch of Oriental literature, he\r\ncaused professorships of Chinese, Sanskrit, and Hindostani to be\r\nestablished in Paris. He left behind him a magnificent library.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n256. GEORGES LÉOPOLD CHRÊTIEN FRÉDÉRIC DAGOBERT CUVIER. _Naturalist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Montbeliard, in France, 1769. Died in Paris, 1832. Aged 63.]\r\n\r\nAt an early age displayed a taste for drawing and natural history, and\r\nan extraordinarily retentive memory. After the Reign of Terror, invited\r\nto Paris, where he prepared his “Tabular Arrangement of the Natural\r\nHistory of Animals,” which has served as the basis for all subsequent\r\nworks on zoological classification. Shortly afterwards commenced the\r\nformation of his celebrated collection for the study of comparative\r\nanatomy. His greatest work, “The Animal Kingdom distributed according to\r\nits Organization,” has been the foundation of all zoological studies\r\nsince his time. Possessed of great administrative capacity. Famous for\r\nhis discoveries among fossil animals, and by these rendered invaluable\r\nservices to geology. Was made Councillor of State, by Napoleon. In 1881,\r\nraised to the peerage. His writings very attractive. His mind active and\r\nenterprising, yet sound and methodical. Unlike Buffon, he considered\r\n_system_ indispensable in the investigations of physiology. Solicitous\r\nfor the diffusion of knowledge. A good as well as great man.\r\nUnimpeachable in all the relations of social life.\r\n\r\n256*. JEAN LE ROND D’ALEMBERT. _Mathematician and Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1717. Died there, 1783. Aged 66.]\r\n\r\nWhen an infant exposed in the church of Le Rond, from which he is named.\r\nNursed in obscurity by the wife of a glazier; educated at the College of\r\nMazarin. Evinced astounding precocity and a decided inclination for\r\nmathematical studies. At the age of twenty-four gave proof of his great\r\nmathematical knowledge, and gained admission into the Academy of\r\nSciences. Memorable for his connexion with the great French work\r\n“L’Encyclopédie,” to which he contributed many articles, and its\r\nexcellent preliminary discourse. In 1772, appointed Secretary to the\r\nFrench Academy. The author of many celebrated works on his favourite\r\nscience, in which he was an undoubted discoverer. He was the friend of\r\nthe Empress Catharine of Russia, and of Frederic the Great of Prussia.\r\nIn the war which in his time was carried on against the church, he took\r\nhis place by the side of his friends Diderot, Voltaire, Grimm, and\r\nD’Holbach.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n256**. ALEXANDRE LOUIS JOSEPH, MARQUIS DE LABORDE. _Soldier, Traveller,\r\nand Educator._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1774. Died there, 1842. Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nAt the breaking out of the French Revolution, entered the Austrian\r\nservice, in which he remained nine years. After the treaty of Campo\r\nFormio, revisited his native city, prosecuted the study of literature\r\nand the arts, and attached himself to Napoleon and the Imperial family.\r\nThen travelled through. England, Holland, and Spain; accompanied\r\nNapoleon to the last-named country, and went with the Emperor also to\r\nAustria in 1810. He held many important offices during Buonaparte’s\r\nlife, and formed one of the Embassy appointed to demand the hand of\r\nMaria Louisa. After the Restoration the influence of Laborde ceased; his\r\nusefulness, however, continued, for he took great pains to introduce\r\ninto France the Lancasterian system of education for poor children. In\r\n1822, he was elected Deputy for Paris; and in 1830, signed, with 220\r\nother Deputies, the protest against the ordinances of Charles X. He was\r\nagain deputy under Louis Philippe. Laborde was a traveller in the East\r\nas well as in the West: an accomplished man, and an eloquent speaker. He\r\nwrote many works having reference to his travels and to his educational\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n256***. GAY LUSSAC. _French Chemist._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1778. Died 1850. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nA leading discoverer in Chemistry whilst the science was advancing with\r\nthe most rapid steps and surprising disclosures. Of a spirit exact and\r\nlarge to reason out abstruse principles, subtly curious to hunt on the\r\ntrack of new marvels, and patient and inventive to repeat, vary, and\r\nheap experiments, his long life of labour might well leave a name\r\nmemorable to his own science, and to the arts which it enlightens and\r\naids. In 1816, he was appointed Professor of Chemistry in the\r\nPolytechnic School. He was one of those who do not shrink from personal\r\nperil in enlarging the domain of science. In. 1804, at the desire of the\r\nFrench government, he ascended in a balloon in order to ascertain by\r\nexperiment, whether the magnetic force suffers perceptible diminution at\r\ngreat elevations, and found no appreciable diminution up to the\r\nelevation of 13,124 feet. Simple, modest, gentle, firm, open and\r\nupright, an unchangeable friend, and a sound patriot:--he carried into\r\nall the relations of life the ardour of truth which animated his\r\nscientific researches.\r\n\r\n256****. CHARLES NODIER. _Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Besançon, in France, 1780. Died, 1844. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nOne of the contributors to the “Biographie Universelle,” and an able\r\nwriter on many subjects. He published a dictionary of words which\r\nnaturally represent by their sound the action signified: and this work\r\nbecame at once, by order of the government, a class-book in all the\r\npublic schools. He also wrote instructive works on flowers and insects.\r\nIn 1800, there appeared from his pen a poem called “Napoleone,” for\r\nwhich he suffered imprisonment. A writer for the _Journal des Débats_\r\nnewspaper; subsequently conducted the _Quotidienne_. In 1834, a member\r\nof the French Academy. He had great rapidity in composition, and\r\npublished many writings; amongst them several novels. As a writer his\r\nstyle is pure; he was hostile to innovations in language. He has been\r\naccused of political tergiversation: and of being, little scrupulous in\r\nthe way of pushing his interests, and forcing a reputation.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS AND STATESMEN.\r\n\r\n257. PIERRE DE TERRAIL, SEIGNEUR DE BAYARD. _Warrior._\r\n\r\n  [Born near Grenoble, in France, 1476. Died, 1524. Aged 48.]\r\n\r\nThe “_Chevalier sans peur et sans reproche_.” A true knight and\r\ngentleman. His earliest renown won at the tourney. At the age of\r\neighteen, entered active service, which he did not quit until his death\r\nin Italy, where he fell, as he desired, by the weapon of the foe on the\r\nfield of battle. Spotless in character, intrepid, generous,\r\nself-denying, and the very soul of honour. He enjoyed the respect and\r\nadmiration of his country’s enemies, and by his own countrymen he was\r\nidolized. After the battle of Marignan, his King, Francis I., one of the\r\nbravest men of his age, desired to receive the order of knighthood from\r\nthe hands of Bayard. The ceremony over, Bayard addressed his sword,\r\nvowing to regard it thenceforward as a sacred relic, never to be drawn\r\nexcept against Turks, Saracens, and Moors. The body of Bayard was\r\nembalmed by the foe and restored to the French for honourable burial, at\r\nGrenoble.\r\n\r\n258. GASTON DE FOIX. _Warrior._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1489. Died at Ravenna, in Italy, 1512. Aged 23.]\r\n\r\nThe nephew of Louis XII. of France. Succeeded the Duke of Longueville in\r\nthe command of the army in Italy, where his prodigies of valour and\r\ndaring exploits gained him the name of the “Thunderbolt of Italy.” He\r\nraised the siege of Ravenna, and in his hot pursuit of the foe, was cut\r\ndown;--slaughtered in the hour of victory.\r\n\r\n  [This is one of the finest French busts. There is also a portrait of\r\n  him in the Gallery of Vienna, by Palma Vecchio.]\r\n\r\n259. MICHEL DE L’HÔPITAL. _Chancellor of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Aigueperse, in France, 1505. Died at Vignay, in France, 1573.\r\n  Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest magistrates of France. Educated by his father, a\r\nsurgeon, for the profession of law, at Toulouse and Padua. Entering\r\nParliament, he became distinguished for his judgment, learning, modesty,\r\nand legal attainments. On the death of Francis I. nominated Ambassador\r\nto the Council of Trent. Upon his return to France, appointed by\r\nMarguerite de Valois, Duchesse de Berri, Private Chancellor of her\r\nHousehold; and after the accession of Henry II., raised to the dignity\r\nof Chancellor of France. Religious dissensions were now rife and bitter,\r\nand L’Hôpital took the side of moderation and justice. It was his hand\r\nthat in 1562 drew up the edict called the “edict of January,” which gave\r\nfreedom of worship to Protestants in France. Hopeless, however, of\r\nseeing an end to the fierce quarrels of Roman Catholics and Calvinists,\r\nhe resigned the seals of office in 1567, and retired into privacy. He\r\nwas still in obscurity when the butchery of St. Bartholomew took place.\r\nDuring the massacre, Catherine de Medicis sent a body-guard to protect\r\nthe Ex-Chancellor. Being told that he was pardoned, L’Hôpital calmly\r\nreplied “that he was not aware that he had done anything demanding\r\neither death or pardon.” The grief and horror which he experienced at\r\nthis dreadful event broke the heart of the mild and conscientious man.\r\nHis character looks all the brighter from the darkness by which he is\r\nsurrounded. His industry was equal to his great learning, and his high\r\nsense of honour and justice corresponded to his humanity. When, in 1554,\r\nhe was made Superintendent of the Royal Finances, he restored an\r\nexhausted treasury by his stern and resolute honesty.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Gois, Sen.]\r\n\r\n260. GASPARD DE COLIGNY. _Marshal and Admiral._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Chatillon-sur-Loin, in France, 1517. Died in Paris, 1572.\r\n  Aged 55.]\r\n\r\nGreatly distinguished for his valour. The head of the Protestant party\r\nin France, and the first victim of the horrible massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew.\r\n\r\n261. PIERRE LAURENT BUIRETTE DE BELLOY. _Dramatist._[32]\r\n\r\n  [Born at St. Flour, in Auvergne, 1727. Died 1775. Aged 48.]\r\n\r\nA writer who acquired immense popularity in his own day, but whose\r\ndeath, it is said, was hastened by grief at the total failure of his\r\nlast dramatic work. His best production is “The Siege of Calais,” which,\r\nas the third great success achieved by his pen, secured for him the gold\r\nmedal accorded by the king to authors who should have been thrice\r\nsuccessful on the stage. The style of Belloy is somewhat laboured and\r\nsententious, and he indulges largely in hyperbole; but he had a happy\r\nknowledge of stage effect. He possessed an astonishing memory; and was\r\nthe first introducer of national subjects, for representation upon the\r\nFrench stage. At an early period of his life he had himself been an\r\nactor in Russia.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by Caffieri. On the pedestal of the bust is\r\n  inscribed--“The work of his friend, Caffieri. 1771.”]\r\n\r\n  [32] This biographical notice belongs properly to “French Poets and\r\n  Dramatists,” and has been unavoidably misplaced.\r\n\r\n262. FRANÇOIS DE BONNE, DUC DE LESDIGUIÈRES. _Constable of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1543. Died 1626. Aged 83.]\r\n\r\nWhen nineteen years of age, a simple archer; but, by dint of great\r\nbravery, activity, and success, he shortly became chief of the\r\nProtestant party in France. In 1575, appointed commander of the\r\nProtestant army in the place of Montbrun; performed great feats of arms\r\nin Dauphiny and Provence, and helped, more than any other soldier of his\r\ntime, to place Henry IV. upon the throne. After the death of Henry, the\r\nreligious convictions of Lesdiguières underwent a remarkable change. He\r\nwas converted to Romanism,--some say, by the persuasive powers of a\r\nmissionary; others, by the dazzling office of Lord High Constable of\r\nFrance, offered on condition that he abjured his faith. It is certain\r\nthat he had a lust of power and wealth, and was unscrupulous in the\r\nmeans of getting them. Yet he had great qualities. He was generous and\r\nforgiving. He was conqueror in every battle he fought. Our own Elizabeth\r\nwas heard to say that “had there been two Lesdiguières in France, she\r\nwould have begged one from the king.” He was indeed a man after her own\r\ngreat heart; for he was brave, handsome, active, full of resources, and\r\nalways successful.\r\n\r\n263. MAXIMILIEN DE BÉTHUNE, DUC DE SULLY. _Minister of State._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rosny, in France, 1560. Died at Villebon, in France, 1641.\r\n  Aged 82.]\r\n\r\nThe early friend and Minister of Henry IV. of France. Educated, like his\r\nroyal master, in the reformed faith, he ran in his youth great risk of\r\nfalling a victim to the terrible massacre of St. Bartholomew. Escaping\r\nfrom that danger, he joined the standard of the young King of Navarre,\r\nshared his dangers, and distinguished himself by the most daring\r\ncourage. His abilities, however, as diplomatist and financier outweighed\r\nhis bravery and impetuosity on the field. When Henry IV. ascended the\r\nthrone of France, Sully became Minister of Finance, and by dint of\r\nskilful management and great labour he so far repaired the monetary\r\ncredit of the nation as to be able to pay off, in the course of ten\r\nyears, a heavy debt, and to leave a considerable surplus in the\r\ntreasury. Upon the accession of James II. of England, he came to this\r\ncountry as ambassador, and concluded a treaty advantageous to the\r\ninterests of both nations. After the assassination of Henry IV., Sully\r\nquietly retired to his estates, where he was frequently consulted\r\nby Louis XIII., and where he composed his interesting “Memoirs.”\r\nHe was amazingly rich, and laden with honours. He held many\r\nappointments--amongst others, those of Governor of Poitou, and Grand\r\nSurveyor of France. Sully was parsimonious, although he had ever been\r\nliberal in supplying the necessities of his royal master, when the King\r\nof Navarre stood in need of help. He had many fine qualities: not the\r\nleast of these was his plain, blunt sincerity in all his dealings with\r\nthe king. He was a most diligent worker, rising invariably at four\r\no’clock in the morning to commence his daily work. He is described as\r\nviolent in temper, avaricious, and greedy of honour as well as money. He\r\nhad largely earned both by his life-long fidelity to his sovereign, and\r\nby the lasting services rendered in the time of peace to the bankrupt\r\nexchequer of his country. He died as he had lived--a Protestant.\r\n\r\n  [From the statue in the Institute of France, by Mouchy.]\r\n\r\n264. CLAUDE FABRI DE PEIRESC. _Patron of Science._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Beaugensier, in France, 1580. Died 1637. Aged 57.]\r\n\r\nA benefactor of his kind, being one of the most notable promoters and\r\npatrons of science and literature. For a long time resident on his\r\nnative soil, then in Italy, England, and Holland, in all which countries\r\nhe collected with the greatest avidity, and at infinite pains, rare\r\nmemorials of antiquity. He encouraged and assisted men of genius\r\nwherever he met them, and corresponded with the learned of his time in\r\nEurope. We are indebted to him for the preservation of several ancient\r\nmanuscripts, and for our acquaintance with fragments of learning, until\r\nhis time unrecovered. He was himself an antiquary, a philologist, and an\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, copied by Claude Francin from a bust by\r\n  Caffieri. Francin died in 1773.

It has not been very\r\n  skilfully restored.]\r\n\r\n265. ABRAHAM DUQUESNE. _Vice Admiral of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Dieppe, in France, 1610. Died in Paris, 1688. Aged 78.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous sea-captains of France. At the age of seventeen,\r\nhe already gained great distinction by his deeds against the Spaniard.\r\nDuring the minority of Louis XIV. entered the navy of Sweden, and\r\ndestroyed the fleet of Christian IV. of Denmark. Returning to France,\r\nperformed illustrious service against Spain and Holland combined;\r\nopposed Ruyter and Van Tromp, and gained important victories over both.\r\nRuyter he completely defeated near Messina, winning that city for the\r\nFrench. In 1683, bombarded Algiers, and in 1684, humbled Genoa.\r\nDuquesne, being a Protestant, did not receive from his royal master the\r\nhighest rank in the French navy, but he was created a Marquis, and upon\r\nthe revocation of the Edict of Nantes, his was the sole name not\r\nincluded in the general proscription. Louis XIV. expressed to this great\r\nsailor his regret that he could not recompense his services as they\r\nmerited, because of his religious faith. When Duquesne repeated this to\r\nhis wife, she said, “You ought to have replied:--‘Sire, if I am a\r\nProtestant, my services are Catholic.’” Like Nelson, Duquesne was in\r\nprivate life admired for his gentleness and sterling worth.\r\n\r\n  [For an account of this statue, see Handbook of Modern Sculpture, No.\r\n  92.]\r\n\r\n266. HENRI DE LA TOUR D’AUVERGNE, VICOMTE DE TURENNE. _Marshal of\r\nFrance._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Sedan, in France, 1611. Died at Baden, 1675. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nThe most skilful commander in Europe, at a time when the art of war was\r\nstudied with greater assiduity than at any previous period. The public\r\nand private acts of Turenne proclaim the inherent grandeur of his mind.\r\nHe was born a Protestant, and becoming a Roman Catholic in after life,\r\nhe exhibited moderation and comprehensive liberality, not always\r\ncharacteristic of the convert. He was sagacious, truthful, and virtuous.\r\nIn war energetic, brave, and full of resources; in private life pure,\r\nkind, and disinterested. He entered upon military duty in Holland in his\r\n13th year. After the death of Louis XIII., Mazarin and the Queen Mother\r\nenlisted the successful soldier in their service, and conferred upon him\r\nthe Marshal’s baton. They had no cause to repent the act. He performed\r\ngreat deeds in Germany, took part in the wars of the Fronde, and covered\r\nhimself with glory in every campaign. He fell whilst leading his men\r\ninto action, and his marshalled troops, paralysed by the blow, retired\r\nwithout hazarding a battle. Montecucculi, the opposed commander, on\r\nseeing the movement, exclaimed, “Turenne is dead.” Turenne was\r\nunprepossessing in appearance: he had a fierce expression, was of the\r\nmiddle height, with very broad shoulders and thick eyebrows. He was\r\nmourned, by order of the King, as a prince of the blood royal, and\r\nburied with kings in the Church of St. Denis. Napoleon said, at St.\r\nHelena, that he had studied the life of Turenne, deeming his renown\r\nexaggerated, but that he had risen from the study confirmed in his\r\nopinion of the commander’s greatness. “The boldness of Turenne,” he\r\nadded, “increased with his experience; for he was more daring at the\r\nclose than at the outset of his career. It was the reverse with Condé,\r\nwho made so great display at starting.”\r\n\r\n267. EDOUARD COLBERT. _Minister of State._\r\n\r\n  [Died, 1693.]\r\n\r\nBrother of the great Jean Baptiste Colbert, who was Finance Minister of\r\nLouis XIV. Edouard was a lieutenant-general in the army, and a member of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by Desjardins, a Dutch sculptor, born at\r\n  Breda, 1640, who died at Paris, in 1694. Desjardins attained to\r\n  eminence and became principal of the Académie in Paris. The original\r\n  is inscribed--“E. C. Marquis de Colbert, Surintendant des batimens du\r\n  Roy, agé de LXIIII. ans.”]\r\n\r\n267*. JEAN BAPTISTE COLBERT. _Statesman and Financier._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Reims, in France, 1619. Died in Paris, 1683. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Louis XIV. would never have been so great a King\r\nhad not Colbert been so great a financier. And there is warrant for the\r\nremark. His soul was absorbed in the work of glorifying France, and he\r\ncarried out his patriotic object by re-establishing order in the\r\nfinances of the country, from which he contended all material prosperity\r\nflows--by a reconstruction of the whole commercial system--by adorning\r\nthe capital with great public works, and by a general encouragement of\r\nart and literature. Some authors assert that Colbert was the son of a\r\ndraper. His mind was that of the most enlightened statesman. In early\r\nlife, Mazarin had been his patron, and when the Cardinal died, he\r\nbequeathed his friend to the King as the best legacy he could leave him,\r\nand he appointed him his own executor. France prospered under his hand,\r\nwhich suffered no fatigue from inordinate exertion, and which\r\nruled,---if occasionally with a rod of iron,--with a success that has\r\nleft some of its effects visible even at the present day. He died spent\r\nwith service, having lived through intrigues and rivalries.\r\n\r\n  [This bust, which is to come, is from a marble in the Louvre, by\r\n  Michel Anguier, who died in 1686. He was the artist who executed the\r\n  sculptures of the Triumphal Arch at Paris, called the Porte St. Denis.\r\n  The costume is the court dress, with a mantle over, which is the Order\r\n  of the Holy Spirit, and the Cordon. At Versailles there is a bust also\r\n  from the life, by Coysevox, who did the kneeling statue on his tomb in\r\n  the church of St. Eustace, a copy of which is there also.]\r\n\r\n268. LOUIS II. DE BOURBON, PRINCE DE CONDÉ, surnamed THE GREAT CONDÉ.\r\n_Warrior._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1621. Died at Fontainbleau, in France, 1686. Aged 65.]\r\n\r\nA great soldier, daring, impetuous, valiant, brilliant in his\r\nachievements, and, in the pursuit of victory, utterly regardless of\r\nhuman life, whether in respect of himself or of others. When he first\r\nentered the army, he served under the great Turenne, but in 1643, five\r\ndays after the accession of Louis XIV., being invested with the chief\r\ncommand of the armies of Flanders and Picardy, he won the famous battle\r\nof Rocroi, in which, with a most inadequate force, he annihilated the\r\nveteran Spanish troops. From 1643 to 1649, he accumulated glory and\r\nhonour upon his brow. In 1650, Mazarin, alarmed by the position assumed\r\nby the laurelled warrior during the troubles of the “Fronde,” arrested\r\nhim, and imprisoned him in the Bastille. Released after thirteen months’\r\nconfinement, Condé in revenge threw himself into the arms of Spain, and\r\nmarched against Paris; where, however, his bravery and hot indignation\r\ncould make little way against Turenne. Peace having been concluded in\r\n1659, Condé returned to France, resumed his old allegiance, and took\r\npart in the triumphant victories of the time. When Turenne was killed at\r\nSalzbach, in 1675, Condé assumed the place of the deceased commander,\r\nbut only to make his last campaign; for ill-health soon compelled him to\r\nlay down his arms for ever. He retired to his estate at Chantilly, and\r\npassed the remainder of his days in the society and patronage of the\r\nchief literary men of the time. He was the friend of Racine and Molière,\r\nand an enthusiastic admirer of Corneille. Condé was a hero on the field\r\nof battle, but there only:--as a man, proud, fierce, eager, passionate,\r\nand ambitious. He had an eagle glance, and a spirit easily roused. After\r\nthe wont of the great world in France in those days, he became religious\r\nin his decline.\r\n\r\n269. HENRI FRANÇOIS D’AGUESSEAU. _Chancellor of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Limoges, in France, 1668. Died at Fresnes, in France, 1751.\r\n  Aged 83.]\r\n\r\nA distinguished orator and judge, a fine scholar, a loyal citizen, and a\r\nworthy, if in some respects, a weak man. He improved the administration\r\nof justice in France, defended the monarchy against papal aggression,\r\nand the people from the aggressions of the monarch. He became Chancellor\r\nin 1717, but resolutely opposing the dangerous system of finance known\r\nas “Law’s system,” he was deprived of the seals and banished. In 1720,\r\nhe was recalled, to counteract the disastrous effects of Law’s schemes;\r\nbut in 1722, making another stand against corruption, he was again\r\ndismissed, by the influence of Court intrigue. Once more invited back to\r\noffice, he served his country until 1750, when he finally resigned the\r\nChancellorship. He was distinguished for gentleness of manner and\r\nsweetness of disposition, as much as for love of honesty and truth. It\r\nwas said of him, that his thoughts were those of a philosopher; his\r\nspeech, that of an orator. He was conversant with many ancient and\r\nmodern languages, and he wrote Latin and other verses. His works,\r\nchiefly legal, formed thirteen quarto volumes.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre.]\r\n\r\n270. MAURICE, COMTE DE SAXE. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Dresden, in Saxony, 1696. Died at Chambord, in France, 1750.\r\n  Aged 54.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most illustrious warriors of the eighteenth century. The\r\nnatural son of Frederic Augustus II., King of Poland, and Aurora, the\r\ncelebrated Countess of Königsmarck. In 1711, he followed the King of\r\nPoland to Stralsund; he also served in Hungary against the Turks, and\r\nwas at the siege of Belgrade. In 1720, he entered the service of France,\r\nin which, after famous deeds of heroism, and many brilliant triumphs, he\r\nrose to the highest rank. In 1745, he gained the battle of Fontenoy, and\r\nby the capture of Mäestricht in 1747, he secured the peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle. Marshal Saxe was large in size, and of extraordinary\r\nstrength. He was a Lutheran.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by J. B. Pigalle, a celebrated French\r\n  sculptor of the last century, who died at Paris in 1785.

The statue at Versailles is the work of M.\r\n  Rude, in 1836. Another bust, by Cartellier, treated in the Antique\r\n  style, is in the Tuileries.]\r\n\r\n271. FRANÇOIS CHRISTOPHE KELLERMANN. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Strasbourg, in France, 1735. Died in Paris, 1820. Aged 85.]\r\n\r\nOne of Napoleon’s generals. Commanded at the battle of Valmy, 1792,\r\nagainst the Duke of Brunswick, and his victory probably determined the\r\nfate of Europe until 1815. Years afterwards it was his good fortune to\r\ndecide the issue of one of Napoleon’s greatest battles by the brilliancy\r\nof his charge. Napoleon said “the charge was opportune.” “Opportune!”\r\nreplied Kellermann, “it has put the crown upon your head.” The Emperor\r\nnever forgave the remark. Kellermann excelled in statesman-like tact and\r\nfinesse.\r\n\r\n272. CHARLES FRANÇOIS DUMOURIEZ. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cambrai, in France, 1739. Died, 1823. Aged 84.]\r\n\r\nPlayed a conspicuous part in the first French Revolution, changing from\r\none party to another. His antipathy to the extreme Republicans induced\r\nhim at last to treat with Austria for the invasion of France, but,\r\ndeserted by his army, he retired to Hamburgh and thence to England. A\r\nfriend of Lord Castlereagh and the late Duke of Kent. Enterprising,\r\nambitious, and capable, but inconsiderate and hasty. He wrote several\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n273. THÉOPHILE MALO DE LA TOUR D’AUVERGNE-CORRET. _Warrior._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cartraix, in Lower Britanny, 1743. Died at Neuburg, in\r\n  Bavaria, 1800. Aged 57.]\r\n\r\nStyled by Napoleon “the first grenadier of France.” Entered the Spanish\r\narmy as a volunteer, and conducted himself with great bravery and\r\nhumanity at the siege of Mahon. Throughout his military life exhibited\r\nunflinching valour and singular judgment. After the close of his\r\nservice, re-entered the army as the substitute for the son of a friend,\r\nwho had been drawn as conscript. Killed at the battle of Neuburg, he was\r\nburied on the field, but his heart was embalmed and confided to the care\r\nof his regiment. A hero in war, and in private life. An excellent\r\nscholar, well versed in history, eminent as a linguist, and known as the\r\nauthor of a Franco-Celtic Dictionary. As a signal distinction, the name\r\nof La Tour D’Auvergne, after his death, was still called, in its turn,\r\nin the muster-roll of his regiment.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries. The author not known, but supposed\r\n  to be Chas. Louis Corbet.]\r\n\r\n274. PIERRE ALEXANDRE BERTHIER. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Versailles, in France, 1753. Died at Hamburg, in Germany,\r\n  1815. Aged 62.]\r\n\r\nThe bosom friend of Napoleon, and his constant companion in his\r\ncampaigns. He received in person the Emperor’s instructions, and\r\nforwarded them to the different generals. Performed his duties with\r\ndocility, readiness, and perfect silence, and never betrayed his\r\nmaster’s secrets. As a subordinate unsurpassed, but had none of the\r\nqualities of a commander. He proved ungrateful. On the fall of Napoleon,\r\nhe went over to the Bourbons; on Napoleon’s return from Elba he changed\r\nagain, but to be repulsed by his former chief. After Waterloo the\r\nBourbons refused to countenance him, whereupon he fell into melancholy\r\nand died by his own hand.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries.]\r\n\r\n275. JEAN BAPTISTE KLEBER. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Strasbourg, in France, 1754. Assassinated at Cairo, in Egypt,\r\n  1800. Aged 46.]\r\n\r\nAt first in the Bavarian army. At the breaking out of the French\r\nRevolution, served France in the ranks. His lofty stature, martial air,\r\nand fearless demeanour soon insured his promotion. With Napoleon in the\r\nEgyptian expedition. Left in command of the army in Egypt, he captured\r\nCairo, but was himself assassinated in that city by a native of Aleppo.\r\nIn him cool judgment and romantic bravery were combined; and his\r\nhumanity and integrity equalled his courage and coolness. Napoleon\r\npronounced him one of the greatest of his generals,\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries, by Masson.

FRANÇOIS JOSEPH LEFEBVRE, DUC DE DANTZIC. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Alsace, 1755. Died in Paris, 1820. Aged 65.]\r\n\r\nOne of the many who at the breaking out of the French Revolution found\r\nthemselves on the lowest step of the social ladder, and in time, by\r\nforce of ability and valour, mounted to the very highest. Lefebvre was\r\nthe son of a miller, and being an orphan, was brought up in charity by a\r\nrelative. He enlisted in the Guard, and, at the time of the Revolution,\r\nhad become a sergeant. Before forty, he was General of brigade. In 1804,\r\nMarshal of the Empire. In 1807, besieged and took Dantzic, and for the\r\nexploit received his title. In the expedition to Russia (1812) he had\r\nthe command of the Imperial Guard. Upon the restoration of Louis XVIII,\r\nmade peer of France, but deprived of his dignity at the second\r\nrestoration, in consequence of his equivocal conduct during the hundred\r\ndays. He died in 1820, having followed twelve sons to the grave. He was\r\nnot a brilliant soldier, nor had he striking qualities of mind; but he\r\nwas intelligent, well-informed, modest, and discreet--qualities not\r\nwithout their value in an officer of Napoleon’s army.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries.]\r\n\r\n277. MARIE PAUL GILBERT MOTIER, MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Chavagnac, in France, 1757. Died in Paris, 1834. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nOf noble family, but a republican and an enthusiast from his earliest\r\nyouth. He was only twenty-three years of age when he embarked secretly\r\nfor America, in order to take part in the War of Independence. Raising\r\nand equipping a body of men at his own expense, he fought at the battles\r\nof Brandywine and Monmouth. He was again in France in 1779, for the\r\npurpose of concluding a treaty between that country and America;\r\nreturned ta America after accomplishing his object, and commanded\r\nWashington’s vanguard when Lord Cornwallis surrendered in 1782. His\r\nzeal, on behalf of America and the republican cause, knew no bounds, and\r\nhis restlessness was excessive. Many of his proposed schemes were wild\r\nand impossible. During the French Revolution, this arch-republican was\r\nhimself obliged to fly from France, in order to save his head, and being\r\ntaken by the Austrians, was imprisoned for five years at Olmütz.\r\nBuonaparte stipulated for his deliverance, in the treaty of Campo Formio\r\n(1796), and obtained it, but Lafayette took no part in politics under\r\nNapoleon, and at the Restoration publicly evinced his dislike for the\r\nBourbons. In 1824, he revisited America, where he was received with an\r\naffectionate welcome, and acknowledged as one of the joint founders,\r\nwith Washington and Franklin, of American Freedom. The Revolution of\r\n1830 saw Lafayette, for a day, Dictator of France, but he resigned that\r\nsupremacy to hand over the vacant throne to Louis Philippe. Lafayette,\r\nwith purity of intention, and elevation of principle, was the victim of\r\nvanity, puerile simplicity, and an overweening-love of popularity. His\r\nheart was stronger than his head: his capacity for public business not\r\nequal to the virtues which adorned his heart. Brave and chivalrous to a\r\nfault, he was without solid judgment. One error ran through his life: he\r\nbelieved that the constitution of America might be transplanted to his\r\nown soil; and that a throne, surrounded by republican institutions,\r\nwould be the very perfection of human government, even in France.\r\n\r\n278. PIERRE FRANÇOIS CHARLES AUGEREAU. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1757. Died at La Houssaye, in France, 1816. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nOne of Napoleon’s generals, and remarkable for his recklessness and\r\ncourage. At the age of 35, in the ranks, he rose to become a General of\r\nDivision. On the fall of Napoleon, he took his army over to the\r\nBourbons. When Napoleon returned from Elba he shouted “_Vive\r\nl’Empereur!_” After Waterloo, he again joined the legitimate monarch.\r\nHis avarice was unbounded: he robbed churches and private houses, and\r\nhis coarse manners contrasted strongly with the pomp of his dress and\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries, by Masson.]\r\n\r\n279. ANDRÉ MASSENA. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Nice, in Italy, 1758. Died in Paris, 1817. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nThe French General whom Napoleon styled “The Child of Victory.” Entered\r\nthe French army as a private soldier, and in 1793 was General of\r\nDivision. Sharing in the brilliant campaigns of Napoleon, he was\r\ndistinguished by his irresistible impetuosity, clear penetration, and\r\nmilitary skill. In comprehensiveness of view, and in the formation of\r\nthose combinations on which the fate of battles depends, he was superior\r\nto all his brother Marshals. He opposed Wellington in Portugal, and\r\nconducted the admirable retreat of the French army. Personally, he was\r\navaricious, rapacious, cruel, and mean.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries.]\r\n\r\n279*. PIERRE CLAUDE FRANÇOIS DANNON. _Statesman and Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Boulogne-sur-Mer, 1761. Died in Paris, 1840. Aged 79.]\r\n\r\nTook an active part in the first French Revolution; but not proving\r\nviolent enough for the Jacobins, was sentenced to death. Regaining his\r\nliberty, was appointed one of the Commissioners for drawing up the new\r\nConstitution. Afterwards sent with others to Italy, to organize the\r\nRoman Republic. On his return opposed the ascendancy of Napoleon, but\r\nwas subsequently made Archivist of the Empire. In 1830, restored to\r\noffices, which he lost on the downfall of Buonaparte, and afterwards\r\ncreated peer of France. Wrote much in the “Biographie Universelle,” and\r\nin the “Histoire Littéraire.” Simple in manners, of unaffected modesty,\r\ndisinterested and benevolent.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n279**. PIERRE PAUL ROGER COLLARD. _Statesman and Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Sourmepuis, in France, 1763. Died in Paris, 1845. Aged 82.]\r\n\r\nAt twenty called to the bar. Embraced the revolutionary principles, but\r\ndisgusted with the anarchy to which they led, withdrew to the more\r\npeaceful pursuits of literature. Devoted himself to philosophy, and\r\nsought to counteract the infidel tendencies of his age by a religious\r\nspiritualism. Appointed by Napoleon Professor to the Normal School. At\r\nthe Restoration, re-entered the field of politics and made President of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies. Retired again in 1830. Introduced into France a\r\nsystem of philosophy analogous to that of Reid, the Scotch philosopher,\r\nof whose works he recommended the study. As a politician, one of the\r\nfounders of the popular school known by the name of _Doctrinaires_,\r\nwhich recognised certain principles as essential to all society, and\r\ndesired to render the actions of men conformable to them. A man of\r\nperfect integrity. His interests never interfered with his duty, and he\r\nleft an honoured and unspotted name.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n280. LAZARE HOCHE. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Montreuil, in France, 1768. Died at Witzlar, in Prussia,\r\n  1797. Aged 29.]\r\n\r\nSon of an ostler in the Royal stables at Versailles. First a stable boy,\r\nthen a private soldier, he commanded, at the age of 25, the army of the\r\nMoselle! Set sail to invade Ireland with 25,000 men, but a storm\r\ndispersed his vessels. Afterwards commanded the armies of the Sambre and\r\nMeuse, and forced a passage across the Rhine. His brilliant career cut\r\nshort by death. In his early youth fiery and vehement; but he soon\r\nobtained a mastery over his temper, and became grave, silent, and\r\nthoughtful beyond his years.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries by Delaistre.]\r\n\r\n281. BESSIÈRES, JEAN BAPTISTE. _Duke of Istria. Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Guienne, France, 1768. Died 1813. Aged 45.]\r\n\r\nOne of the bravest, worthiest, and most faithful of Napoleon’s\r\nlieutenants. Served in the first campaign of Italy, in the expedition to\r\nEgypt, in the second campaign of Italy, and was created Marshal in 1804.\r\nIn the subsequent wars in Germany he displayed the highest valour,\r\nskill, and judgment. According to the Emperor, “he was full of fire, but\r\nnever otherwise than prudent and circumspect.” In 1808, achieved victory\r\nin Spain; afterwards greatly contributed to the success of the battle\r\nfought at Essling; and having visited Spain a second time in 1811, he\r\nproceeded in 1812 to Russia, at the head of the Imperial cavalry guard.\r\nOn the morning of the battle of Lützen, in 1813, he betook himself to a\r\nnarrow pass at Rippach, in order to drive out the enemy there vigorously\r\ndefending himself. He was on foot and at the head of his men. The foe\r\nhad already given way, when a shot struck him in the breast and he fell\r\ndead. Napoleon received the news with grief, but it was kept a secret\r\nfrom the army for the rest of the day. The Emperor had lost a friend,\r\nthe soldiers a companion in arms, whose character had never belied his\r\nmilitary deeds. He died very poor, leaving to his family nothing but his\r\ngood name. At St. Helena, Napoleon left 100,000 francs to his son. He\r\nhad not forgotten the fidelity of the father.\r\n\r\n282. BARTHÉLÉMI CATHARINE JOUBERT. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Pont-de-Vaux, in France, 1769. Killed at Novi, in Italy,\r\n  1799. Aged 30.]\r\n\r\nA brave soldier who, had he lived, would undoubtedly have proved not the\r\nleast eminent of the famous Marshals of the Empire. He was intended for\r\nthe bar: but at the breaking out of the Revolution, moved by his\r\nRepublican sympathies, he entered the National Guard. Subsequently\r\nenlisted in the regular army as a common soldier, and rapidly\r\ndistinguished himself. For his admirable conduct under Kellerman, at the\r\nBattle of Loano (1795), he was made General of Brigade upon the field.\r\nTwo years afterwards he was General of Division. In 1798, he succeeded\r\nGeneral Brune in the command of the army in Italy. He fell at Novi,\r\nwhilst impetuously leading on his men. He was prompt, energetic, and\r\nfearless to a fault; he enjoyed the unbounded confidence of the\r\nsoldiers, and his private life was stainless. His countenance had a\r\nmelancholy cast--his manner was grave and silent. When he spoke it was\r\nwith blunt and soldier-like brevity. An ardent Republican. One great aim\r\nof his life was said to be the dethronement of all the petty sovereigns\r\nof Italy, and the substitution of one great Italian Republic.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries by Boizot.]\r\n\r\n283. LOUIS CHARLES ANTOINE DESAIX. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at St. Hilaire D’Argat, in France, 1768. Killed at Marengo, in\r\n  Piedmont, 1800. Aged 32.]\r\n\r\nA celebrated General of the French Republic. Brave, discreet, prompt,\r\nintelligent, and energetic. Mainly contributed to Napoleon’s triumphs in\r\nEgypt; and at Marengo, where he fell, his charge against the Austrians\r\ncontributed largely to the fate of the day. Napoleon considered Desaix\r\nonly second to himself, and said of him that “he thought only of glory;\r\nand luxury, and even comfort he despised.” Mild yet decided in\r\ncharacter; and so just in his conduct as to have gained in Egypt the\r\nname of “the Just Sultan.”\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries by Dejoux.]\r\n\r\n284. JEAN LANNES, DUC DE MONTEBELLO. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Guienne, 1769. Killed at Essling, in Austria, 1809. Aged 40.]\r\n\r\nIn the first rank of Napoleon’s renowned Marshals. Of poor and humble\r\nparents, was in early life apprenticed to a dyer. In 1792, entered the\r\narmy as a volunteer. By signal intelligence, activity, and matchless\r\ncourage, soon fought his way upward, and secured the notice of Napoleon.\r\nDistinguished himself greatly in the first Italian campaign; accompanied\r\nBuonaparte to Egypt; followed him again into Italy in 1800, and covered\r\nhimself with glory at Montebello in 1804, when he was created Duke. At\r\nAusterlitz, Jena, Eylau, and Friedland; and at one and all justified the\r\nfame his skill and intrepidity had gained. At the battle of Essling,\r\n1809, he had the command of the centre. On the 22nd, on passing through\r\nthe lines to cheer on his men, he was struck by a cannon shot, which\r\ntook off both legs. He was borne to the Emperor, who was deeply affected\r\nat the sight of his brave and mutilated soldier. When speaking of\r\nLannes, at a later period, Napoleon said that “at first his courage\r\ncarried away his mind; but by degrees his mind came more and more\r\nabreast of his courage, and he was great when he perished. I took him,”\r\nhe added, “a pigmy: I lost him a giant.”\r\n\r\n285. MICHEL NEY. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at St. Louis, in France, 1769. Was judicially shot, in Paris,\r\n  1815. Aged 46.]\r\n\r\nKnown as “The Bravest of the Brave.” The son of poor parents. Enlisted\r\nat the age of thirteen, and speedily fought his way up to the command of\r\na division. His name intimately connected with Buonaparte’s military\r\ncareer. He secured the retreat of the small remnant of the grand army\r\nafter the disastrous Russian invasion, and at Waterloo he had five\r\nhorses shot under him. After the final overthrow of Napoleon in 1815,\r\nNey was tried and shot for his treachery to the Bourbons in joining the\r\nEmperor on his return from Elba. A monument recently erected on the spot\r\nwhere he fell has translated the act of treachery into a triumph of\r\npatriotism. Ney was sincere, honest, blunt, and almost austere in his\r\nmanners, yet merciful to the vanquished. It is recorded to his honour\r\nthat he lived and died poor.\r\n\r\n286. FRANÇOIS SÉVÉRIN DESGRAVIERS MARCEAU. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Chartres, in France, 1769. Killed at Hochsteinbach, in\r\n  Germany, 1796. Aged 27.]\r\n\r\nBrave, generous, and heroic, gifted for great military achievements.\r\nTwice narrowly escaped the guillotine; once for gallantly protecting a\r\nbeautiful woman from the brutality of the soldiers. He fell mortally\r\nwounded in the forest of Hochsteinbach; and the armies of France and\r\nAustria both showed honour to his memory by firing volleys of artillery\r\nover his grave.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries by Ed. Dumont.]\r\n\r\n287. PIERRE JACQUES CAMBRONNE. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at St. Sebastian, near Nantes, 1770. Died 1842. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nA brave, humane, and faithful soldier, who rose in virtue of his own\r\ngood deeds from the ranks, and made for himself an honoured name in the\r\nFrench army. He entered that army in his twentieth year, and knew no\r\nrepose until the peace of 1815. He made one in Hoche’s unsuccessful\r\nexpedition against Ireland, fought in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, and was\r\npresent at the battles of Lützen, Bautzen, Dresden, and Leipzig. Devoted\r\nto the Emperor, he accompanied him to Elba; returned with him in 1815;\r\nand at Waterloo was found ready as ever at his post, commanding a\r\ndivision of the Old Guard. At Waterloo, as befitted this brave and\r\nsimple-minded soldier, he performed his best service. His men were\r\nslaughtered around him, and, threatened with death himself, he was\r\ncalled upon to surrender. His answer has been treasured up in the annals\r\nof the French army: “The Guard dies, but does not surrender.” He was\r\ntaken prisoner, covered with wounds. In 1816, he was tried by a council\r\nof war; but he had broken no oath to the Bourbons, and was acquitted.\r\nOther generals of Napoleon have a wider fame; none can show a better\r\ntitle to their renown.\r\n\r\n  [By Debay, 1816.]\r\n\r\n288. LOUIS NICOLAS DAVOUST, PRINCE D’ECKMUHL. _Marshal of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Annoux, in Burgundy, 1770. Died in Paris, 1823. Aged 53.]\r\n\r\nOne of the bravest and ablest of Buonaparte’s lieutenants. Cool and\r\ncollected in danger, energetic and methodic in his plans. His troops\r\nwere always in better order than those of any other general. Served at\r\nUlm, Austerlitz, Jena, and Auerstadt, and successfully defended Hamburgh\r\nagainst the allies. Cruel, rapacious and coarse. His extortions,\r\noppressions, and murders gained for him the title of the Hamburgh\r\nRobespierre. Upon the fall of Napoleon, he retired from active life.\r\n\r\n289. MAXIMILIEN SEBASTIEN FOY. _French General._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Ham, in Picardy, 1775. Died in Paris, 1825. Aged 50.]\r\n\r\nBegan his military career at 15. Served in the Peninsular war, and at\r\nWaterloo received his fifteenth wound. Entered the Chamber of Deputies\r\nafter the peace, became an orator, an opponent of the reactionary\r\ngovernment, and one of the most popular men of his time. He died poor,\r\nand a subscription of 40,000_l._ was raised for the relief of his\r\ndestitute family. Skilful and courageous in the field. Left an\r\nunfinished history of the Peninsular war, which is honest, candid and\r\neloquent.\r\n\r\n290. ANTOINE CHARLES LOUIS COLLINET DE LASALLE. _General of Cavalry._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Metz, in France, 1775. Killed at Wagram, in Austria, 1809.\r\n  Aged 34.]\r\n\r\nA famous officer in the wars of Napoleon. Served with the revolutionary\r\narmy in 1793, on the Rhone and Moselle. Accompanied Kellermann as\r\nAide-de-Camp into Italy, and there was made prisoner. When taken before\r\nthe veteran and war-tried field-marshal Wurmser, and asked the age of\r\nBuonaparte, he replied, “Of the age of Scipio when he conquered\r\nHannibal.” At a later period with Napoleon in Egypt. In 1801, in Italy,\r\nwhere at the battle of Caldiero he had three horses killed under him.\r\nHis later services were unremitting, and always brilliant. He fell\r\nmortally wounded at the battle of Wagram, July 6, 1809. On the eve of\r\nthe battle he had a singular presentiment of his coming death. He rose\r\nin the night for the express purpose of inditing a letter to the\r\nEmperor, praying his consideration on behalf of his wife and children.\r\nThe letter was placed the next morning in the hands of the Emperor at\r\nthe very moment when news also came of the hero’s death. A dauntless\r\nsoldier, and of spotless fidelity to his chief.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Tuileries by Delaistre.]\r\n\r\n291. CASIMIR PÉRIER. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Grenoble, in France, 1777. Died in Paris, 1832. Aged 55.]\r\n\r\nFirst served in the army. Then entered into business, established a\r\nbanking-house, and embarked in commercial speculations, which proved\r\nsuccessful. Elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies. Until 1830, the\r\nfierce opponent of government, and the chief advocate of the popular\r\ncause. In 1831, until his death, Prime Minister of Louis Philippe; his\r\npolicy the preservation of peace, the repression of the military spirit,\r\nand the encouragement of commerce.

GEORGES D’AMBOISE. _Cardinal and Minister of State._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Chaumont sur Loire, in France, 1460. Died at Lyons, 1510.\r\n  Aged 50.]\r\n\r\nAs Prime Minister of Louis XII. of France, acquired popularity by\r\nreforming abuses and relieving the burdens of the subject. Acquired the\r\ntitle of “Father of the People.” Also Archbishop of Rouen. When created\r\nCardinal, effected great reforms in some of the religious Orders.\r\nBenevolent and charitable. Never in possession of more than one\r\nbenefice, two-thirds of which he gave to the church and to the poor.\r\n\r\n  [From the statue in the Cathedral at Rouen.]\r\n\r\n292. CARDINAL RICHELIEU. _Minister of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1585. Died there, 1642. Aged 57.]\r\n\r\nThe great Minister of Louis XIII., and the actual ruler of France during\r\nthat monarch’s reign. He was the third son of François du Plessis,\r\nSeigneur de Richelieu, and at first destined for the army, but renounced\r\nthis career for the Church, when his elder brother gave up his\r\necclesiastical dignities for a monastic life. His political career\r\ncommenced when he was appointed Secretary of State for the War and\r\nForeign Departments; and it was sustained on the highest eminence, by\r\nthe force of superior intelligence, unequalled craftiness, and an utter\r\ncontempt for conscientious scruples. He was now the grateful protégé of\r\nthe King, now his exacting master; now he was insidiously sowing the\r\nseeds of distrust and dissension amongst all the members of the Royal\r\nFamily, now openly and magnanimously effecting their reconciliation.\r\nBut, subtle and unscrupulous as were the means he employed, his views\r\nwere vast, his political ideas profound, and he laboured strenuously to\r\ngive stability to the French monarchy. He was a heartless man, but a\r\nfaithful minister; jealous of interference with his control, but using\r\nhis boundless influence for the welfare of the nation. He was a right\r\nhypocrite, affecting piety, which he never felt; he was perfidious, and\r\neven cruel; but we look back upon his career with an enforced respect\r\nfor his skill, his strong will, and his undoubted successes. He\r\npersecuted Protestants in France, and abated the power of the French\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Coysevox.

CARDINAL MAZARIN. _Minister of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Rome, 1602. Died at Vincennes, in France, 1661. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nThe pupil, protégé, and successor of Cardinal Richelieu, by whom he was\r\nrecommended to Louis XIII. on his death-bed, and whom he surpassed in\r\ncunning, finesse, intrigue, and in the skill with which he turned all\r\nhis public acts to his own private advantage. His avarice was excessive,\r\nand his coffers groaned with the wealth of the country which he ruled\r\nand impoverished. France was indebted to him for the treaties of\r\nWestphalia and of the Pyrenees, and these constitute his best claim to\r\nthe consideration and gratitude of the French people. Another service\r\nmust not be forgotten. He beggared the French nation, but he endeavoured\r\nto make amends by bequeathing to Louis XIV. the sagacious Colbert, under\r\nwhose strong hand the finances of France rapidly recovered. The\r\ncharacter of Mazarin has been variously described. By some he is\r\nregarded as a great Minister of State, equal to Richelieu; by others as\r\na man of indifferent abilities, with an inordinate share of craftiness\r\nand diplomatic trickery. It is certain that he was deeply versed in the\r\nknowledge of man. Louis XIV. was in leading-strings whilst Mazarin\r\nlived, but sole and absolute monarch from the day of his Minister’s\r\ndeath until the hour of his own. Mazarin founded the first public\r\nlibrary established in France, but he kept the young monarch who was\r\nentrusted to his hands, in shameful ignorance of all that it concerned\r\nthe youthful prince to know.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre by Coysevox.]\r\n\r\n294. BLAISE PASCAL. _Theologian and Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Clermont-Ferrand, in France, 1623. Died in Paris, 1662. Aged\r\n  39.]\r\n\r\nOf a genius so rare as to seem supernatural. In tender years the boy,\r\ndebarred from mathematical books, with charcoal, on the wall of a\r\ngarret, worked out for himself problems answering to nearly the first\r\nbook of Euclid--without definitions or terms,--calling a circle a round,\r\nand a right line a score. Whilst still young, he was a discoverer in\r\nphysics. The rise of water in pumps, and of quicksilver in the\r\nbarometer, had, till his time, been ascribed by the philosophers to the\r\n“horror of Nature for a vacuum.” He guessed that the cause was the\r\npressure of the atmosphere, and verified his conjecture by carrying the\r\nbarometer up a mountain. He saw, agreeably to his expectation, that as\r\nby the ascent the pressure gradually diminished, the quicksilver as\r\ngradually fell. He had a subtle and profound metaphysical intellect,\r\nwith great power to express abstruse thoughts clearly and precisely. His\r\ntemperament was melancholy. A singular hallucination hung by\r\nhim--without otherwise disturbing the sound use of his faculties--that\r\nat his side a visible gulph was ever yawning. The melancholy took a\r\ndeeper hue as he advanced towards the close of his brief life. He became\r\nreligiously austere, and subjected himself to personal mortification and\r\ntrials, under which elasticity and health gave way. Yet the pious\r\nphilosopher was not without the lighter qualities of the mind. His\r\ncelebrated “Provincial Letters,” written in defence of the doctrines of\r\nthe Abbey of Port Royal, against the Jesuits, are bright with the\r\nkeenest satire. Pascal was a great mathematician, a true philosopher,\r\nand one of the purest of men.\r\n\r\n295. JACQUES BENIGNE BOSSUET. _Prelate of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Dijon, 1627. Died in Paris, 1704. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Voltaire, the eloquence of Bossuet stands unrivalled. His\r\n_Universal History_, published for his pupil, the son of Louis XIV.,\r\nwritten to point out the influence of God animating all the changes of\r\nhistoric events--an idea expressed in the noble aphorism “_l’homme\r\ns’agite: Dieu le mène_;” (man struggles and strives: but it is God who\r\nleads him). His sermons, funeral orations, and controversial\r\npublications, place him in the very highest rank as a writer. According\r\nto Eustace, who wrote the “Classical Tour,” it is the especial glory of\r\nBossuet to have compelled the French language “to become the vehicle of\r\nsublimity.” In the second part of the _Universal History_, the truths of\r\nChristianity are vindicated with a lofty eloquence that is without equal\r\nin France. One of Bossuet’s controversial works against Protestantism,\r\nconverted Gibbon, in his younger years, to the Roman faith. On one\r\noccasion, he was the opponent in argument of the mild Fénélon. Nothing\r\ncan be more striking than the contrast between the styles of the fiery\r\nBossuet and the gentler, but equally pious and learned author of\r\n“Telemachus.” The illustrious Bossuet was buried in the Cathedral of\r\nMeaux, of which city, his friend, Louis XIV., had appointed him Bishop.\r\nHence he is still popularly styled “The Eagle of Meaux.”\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by A. Coysevox.]\r\n\r\n296. FRANÇOIS DE SALIGNAC DE LAMOTTE FÉNÉLON. _Archbishop and Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Perigord, 1651. Died 1715. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nThe author of “Telemachus.” A meek, pious, wise, and gentle-hearted man\r\nwho passed through life loving all, and doing good to all. The tutor of\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy, the King’s grandson, in whose self-willed and\r\nungovernable temper, his influence and skilful management effected a\r\nmoral conversion. Having engaged in a religious controversy with the\r\ncelebrated Bossuet, who procured his writings to be condemned at Rome,\r\nand subsequently incurring the displeasure of Louis XIV., was banished\r\nby that monarch. The resignation of the archbishop caused the king to\r\nrepent of his injustice, and Fénélon was recalled. Though possessed of\r\nhigh station, great talents, and sound learning, a perfect example of\r\nhumility. The style of Fénélon is melodious, translucent.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by Coysevox, and taken from the life.\r\n  The costume is that of a bishop of the time, with the Order of the\r\n  Holy Spirit round the neck; this Order was broken at the first\r\n  Revolution: the form of the cross is still apparent.

CHARLEMAGNE or CHARLES THE GREAT. _King of the Franks and\r\n  Emperor of the West._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Saltzburg, in Bavaria, A.D. 742. Died A.D. 814. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Pepin, who was the first King of France of the Carlovingian\r\ndynasty. On the death of his father, in A.D. 768, crowned with his\r\nbrother Carloman, joint King of France. On the death of Carloman in A.D.\r\n771, became sole ruler. In 772, commenced the subjugation of the Saxons,\r\nwhom he finally overthrew. Marched into Lombardy to the aid of the Pope,\r\noverran the country, and caused himself to be crowned King of Lombardy\r\nin A.D. 774. Then passed into Spain to assail the Saracen power\r\nestablished there, but suffered defeat at the battle of Roncesval. In\r\nA.D. 800, crowned at Rome “Emperor of the West,” by Pope Leo III.\r\nEngaged in ceaseless warfare throughout his reign; yet a great promoter\r\nof learning, and the founder of several universities. Collecting\r\nenlightened and learned men about him, he completed many national works,\r\nadvanced agriculture and the arts, and rendered himself immortal by the\r\nwisdom of his laws, and by the influence which his magnificent labours\r\nproduced upon the destinies of mankind. He was said to be the tallest\r\nand strongest man of his time. His habits were of the simplest, and his\r\nfrugality a pattern to the world. A steadfast friend and a devoted\r\nfather. He was buried with great pomp at Aix-la-Chapelle, and was\r\nsincerely mourned by his subjects, who had loved him in life. Few kings\r\nhave so legitimately and nobly earned the title of “Great,” as Charles\r\nI., King of the Franks.\r\n\r\n  [A head from the Rotonda of the Vatican. In the Louvre is a very\r\n  remarkable portrait of him in stucco; a similar one is in the Vatican\r\n  library. There is also in the Vatican a large picture of the\r\n  coronation of Charlemagne, which contains a vast number of portraits.]\r\n\r\n296**. PHILIP III. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1245. Died 1285. Aged 40.]\r\n\r\nThis king was surnamed “The Bold” for a reason which historians have\r\nnever been able to discover. He was a mere tool in the hands of his\r\nChamberlain, whom he raised to the dignity of Prime Minister, but who\r\neventually suffered as a common culprit on a gibbet. The king was\r\nwholly given up to superstitious practices, and his rule was disastrous\r\nfor France. During this reign a plain gentleman, Rodolph, count of\r\nHapsburg, was elected Emperor of Germany, and became the founder of a\r\nline of kings in Austria. We are reminded also that one of the most\r\nremarkable events of this period was the momentary reunion of the Greek\r\nand Latin Churches, in 1274, effected by Gregory X. at the second\r\nœcumenic council of Lyons.\r\n\r\n297. LOUIS XI. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bourges, in France, 1423. Died at Duplessis les Tours, 1483.\r\n  Aged 60.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Charles VII. and Mary of Anjou. The mother was one of the\r\nmost virtuous women of her age; the son proved a bad child, a bad\r\nfather, a bad husband, a bad brother, a bad friend, a bad subject, and\r\nin all qualities of the heart, a bad king. He was a tyrant, a cheat, a\r\nbigot; cruel, implacable in his hatred, unscrupulous in revenge, a\r\nmiser, until he had an end to accomplish, when he could prove a\r\nprodigal; crafty, sanguinary, suspicious, and despicably mean. He\r\navailed himself of the humbler orders to crush the power of the\r\nnobility, and loved to surround himself at all times with the lowest\r\ninstruments for the accomplishment of his designs. Four thousand persons\r\nare said to have fallen victims to his cruelty, and history records that\r\nhis father died of privations, self-imposed, through fear of being\r\npoisoned by his son. Yet this concentration of vice was personally\r\nbrave, and a great promoter of letters. He introduced printing into\r\nFrance, and he wrote a book of counsels for his son, which he called\r\n“The Rose Tree of Wars.” He moreover left the royal authority\r\nestablished, and France powerful. His last few years were passed in\r\nseclusion, in suspicious alarm, and constant terror of death.\r\n\r\n  [A characteristic bust; evidently a true portrait, pourtraying the\r\n  well-known bigotry and cruelty of the man.]\r\n\r\n298. LOUIS XII. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Blois,in France, 1462. Died in Paris, 1515. Aged 53.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Charles, Duke of Orleans, and heir presumptive to the throne,\r\nduring the minority of Charles VIII. Disputing the Regency with the\r\nmother of Charles VIII, he was defeated, and suffered severe\r\nimprisonment for the space of three years. Liberated by King Charles in\r\nperson, he conceived a warm friendship for the young monarch, which was\r\nnever broken. In 1498, when Charles died without issue, Louis succeeded\r\nto the French throne. His reign was fruitful of good to his country. He\r\nforgave his enemies, re-established discipline and order in his army,\r\neconomized the resources of the state, and made the army of France\r\nvictorious abroad. He appointed the judges of the land for life, in\r\norder to secure their integrity, encouraged literature and science, and\r\nliberally rewarded men of talent. He was three times married, his last\r\nwife being Mary, sister of Henry VIII. of England. During his reign,\r\nGaston de Foix fell at Ravenna, and the authority of the Pope was\r\nsuspended in France. Louis was of a frank and generous nature, and was\r\ncalled “the Father of his People.”\r\n\r\n  [From the bronze half-figure in the Louvre.]\r\n\r\n299. FRANCIS I. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cognac, in France, 1494. Died at Rambouillet, 1547. Aged 53.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Charles of Angoulême, and cousin-german of Louis XII. of\r\nFrance, whose daughter he married, and whom he succeeded on the French\r\nthrone. A libidinous king, with many knightly qualities, and with all\r\nthe bigotry and self-absorption that characterized too many of the\r\ndespotic rulers of his time. He was a great encourager and patronizer of\r\nletters and the fine arts: but he had no mercy towards the heretic, and,\r\nin 1535, he forbade printing in France under pain of death. Not a\r\nsuccessful warrior; he was taken prisoner at Pavia, during a war with\r\nSpain, and detained at Madrid for the space of a twelvemonth. His\r\nmeeting with our own Henry VIII. on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, in\r\n1520, is known to every reader of history. A lustre is shed upon the\r\nreign of this monarch in consequence of his magnificent patronage of\r\nart, but his life otherwise presents as little for admiration as the\r\nsatyr-looking bust which no doubt faithfully records the lineaments of\r\nthe man. His passions were violent and gross: and though he received the\r\ndignity of knighthood from the hands of a subject, yet even the sword of\r\na Bayard could not endow him with virtue enough to protect him from\r\nwilful prodigality, selfish follies, and open debaucheries.\r\n\r\n  [From the bronze in the Louvre by Jean Cousin, representing the king\r\n  in complete armour, interesting as a work of the time, but far less\r\n  real as a portrait than the head 299A, which is from the celebrated\r\n  monument at St. Denis, by P. Bontemps, where the king is sculptured\r\n  lying dead, and perfectly naked.]\r\n\r\n299A. FRANCIS I. _King of France._\r\n\r\n300. CHARLES V. _Emperor of Germany and King of Spain._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Ghent, in Belgium, 1500. Died in Estremadura, in Spain, 1558.\r\n  Aged 58.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of this undoubtedly great monarch is chiefly remarkable for\r\nthe rivalry which, during twenty-eight years, subsisted between him and\r\nFrancis I., of France, leading to European war, and to battles of varied\r\nfortune, Charles inherited Germany from his father, Spain from his\r\nmother; but the Empire was boldly disputed by Francis I., and thus war\r\ncommenced. After alternate success and defeat, Charles overcame his\r\nrival at Pavia, in 1525, and took him prisoner. Gaining his freedom the\r\nfollowing year, Francis allied himself with Henry VIII. of England, but\r\nCharles V. still contrived to obtain good terms by the treaty of\r\nCambrai, in 1529. The wily Emperor now caused himself to be crowned\r\nEmperor of Rome, and then engaged in a crusade against the Turks. War\r\nagain broke out with France; but this time fortune turned against\r\nCharles, and never pronounced in his favour again. Suffering reverse\r\nupon reverse, his army beaten by disease as much as by the enemy--he\r\nhimself forced to flee, almost alone, for safety--he was thrown into a\r\ndepth of calamity as profound, as his previous condition had been\r\nbrilliant and lofty. Resigning his crown in favour of his son Philip, he\r\nretired to a monastery in Spain, where he closed his career. Charles was\r\nsagacious, cool, crafty, and obstinate, with great grasp of intellect;\r\ncruel and hypocritical, yet not without some knightly qualities. He\r\naffected great piety, especially in his later years, but there was more\r\nof policy than of spiritual conviction in his religious movements. One\r\nof his first acts as king, was to convene the Diet of Worms, to which he\r\ngave Luther a safe conduct. He treated the Protestants with cruel\r\nharshness. No two characters could have been more opposite than those of\r\nthe Royal and Imperial rivals. Their points of difference are admirably\r\ndescribed by Robertson.\r\n\r\n  [From a medallion in bronze in the Louvre. Compare with Titian’s\r\n  portrait, often engraved.]\r\n\r\n301. CHARLOTTE, or CARLOTA D’AVESNE, DUCHESS OF VALENTINO.\r\n\r\n  [Died, 1514.]\r\n\r\nA princess less illustrious for her great beauty and mental endowments,\r\nthan for her virtue and piety. First married to Charles, Prince de\r\nChimey; afterwards forced by Louis XII., to marry the infamous Cæsar\r\nBorgia, whose misfortunes she shared without participating in his vices.\r\n\r\n302. HENRY II. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at St. Germain-en-Laye, in France, 1518. Died in Paris, 1559.\r\n  Aged 41.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Francis I. He pursued the policy of his sire, carried war\r\ninto Italy, and strenuously opposed the House of Austria under Charles\r\nV. and Philip II. He also took arms against England, and was bitter in\r\nhis persecution of Protestants. In his reign France recovered from\r\nEngland the towns of Boulogne and Calais, the latter of which England\r\nhad held for the space of 210 years. Henry II. was an average king of\r\nthe time. He was the slave of his mistress, the celebrated Diana of\r\nPoitiers, upon whom, and upon his favourites, he lavished his wealth; he\r\ncultivated libertinism at Court, he robbed the people, he overstepped\r\nhis legitimate rights, and he left his country largely in debt.\r\nHistorians thank Providence that it was no worse. This monarch died of\r\nan accidental wound, in a tournament, from the hand of Montgomery, the\r\nchief of his Scotch guards.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, by Jean Goujon.

HENRY II. _King of France._\r\n\r\n303. CHARLES IX. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at St. Germain, 1550. Died there, 1574. Aged 24.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Henry II. and Catherine de Medici. He was brought up under\r\nthe tutelage of his mother; and at an early age, gave promise of a good\r\ncareer, exhibiting a taste for literature, princely courage, and a love\r\nof glory. But under the influence of his pernicious mother, he became\r\nprofligate and cruel. His unenviable reign is notorious for the horrible\r\nMassacre of St. Bartholomew, when thousands of Protestants were\r\ndeliberately murdered. Remorse for this tremendous crime followed\r\nCharles IX. to his grave, into which he was prematurely cast by\r\ndiseases, the result of his debaucheries.\r\n\r\n  [From a marble in the Louvre, attributed to Germain Pilon. It\r\n  represents the king in his youth. The pedestal is inscribed, Carolus\r\n  IX. 1568.]\r\n\r\n304. HENRY III. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Fontainebleau, 1552. Died at St. Cloud, 1589. Aged 37.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Henry II. and Catherine de Medici. He acquired military fame\r\nas Duke of Anjou, by the victories of Jarnac and Moncontoni, gained over\r\nthe Huguenots. In 1573, he was elected King of Poland; but on the death\r\nof his brother, Charles IX. of France, he relinquished the sovereignty\r\nof Poland for that of France. As King, his early energy and manly\r\ncourage, gave place to shameless vice and debauchery. He was surrounded\r\nby the most unworthy favourites, who caused his reign to be designated\r\nas “The reign of the minions.” He had had a hand in the Massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew; but at a later period, driven out of his own capital by a\r\nfaction, he formed an alliance with Henry of Navarre, the chief of the\r\nProtestants, and with that prince he laid siege to Paris. He was thus\r\nemployed at the camp of St. Cloud, when he was assassinated by a monk,\r\nnamed Jacques Clement. Henry III. has been described, by some\r\nhistorians, as a pupil of Machiavelli, concealing a profoundly devised\r\nplan beneath his gross immoralities, obscenities, and blasphemies. His\r\nacts were frequently those of a madman, yet he was not without good\r\nqualities. He was the last king of the house of Valois. It had reigned\r\n261 years, and given 13 monarchs to France.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre, by Germain Pilon. Like its fellow, No.\r\n  302A, very much eaten away, as though at some time exposed to the\r\n  weather.]\r\n\r\n305. HENRY IV. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Pau, in France, 1553. Assassinated in Paris, 1610. Aged 57.]\r\n\r\nEducated in the reformed religion by his mother, Jeanne d’Albret, he\r\nbecame head of the Huguenot party: as such he took part in the civil\r\nwars, which arose in the reign of Henry III., and was in consequence\r\nexcommunicated by Pope Sixtus V. Acknowledged King of France by a\r\nportion of the French army after the death of Henry III., he took arms\r\nagainst the League, vanquished its followers in several engagements, and\r\nfinally entered Paris, after professing his adherence to the Roman\r\nCatholic faith. In the reign of Henry IV. the humane Edict of Nantes,\r\nwhich gave toleration to Protestantism, was promulgated, and the\r\nsagacious reforms of the Minister Sully, a Protestant, helped largely to\r\nthe restoration of order, and to the development of the public\r\nresources. The arsenals were replenished, roads and canals were made,\r\ntaxation was reduced, and the industry of the people fostered. Whilst\r\nthis salutary work was going on, and Henry IV. and his. Minister were\r\nnegociating the most important treaties with the various powers of\r\nEurope, in order to establish a general confederacy and a lasting peace,\r\nthe monarch fell by the knife of Ravaillac, a fanatic. Henry IV. was an\r\nunfaithful husband, and unstable in his religion. He had many\r\nmistresses, and he twice abjured his faith: but he was the author of the\r\nedict of Nantes.\r\n\r\n305A. HENRY IV. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [A very elegant statuette of the time. The head beautifully\r\n  sculptured, and evidently a good portrait.]\r\n\r\n306. MARIE DE’ MEDICI. _Queen of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Florence, 1573. Died at Cologne, 1642. Aged 69.]\r\n\r\nDaughter of Francis II., Grand Duke of Tuscany; wife of Henry IV. of\r\nFrance; and mother of Henrietta-Maria, the queen of Charles I. of\r\nEngland. She wedded Henry IV. after he had divorced his first wife,\r\nMargaret of Valois, and the alliance was not a happy one. Crowned the\r\nday before the assassination of her husband, at which some of her\r\ncontemporaries more than suspected that she herself connived. But no\r\nproof of her guilt has been forthcoming. Regent during the minority of\r\nher son Louis XIII., she threw France into confusion by her\r\nmisgovernment, prodigality, intrigues and wilfulness. The confusion\r\nended in civil war. Resigning the regency when Louis XIII. attained his\r\nmajority, she took up arms against her son; but reconciliation being\r\nmade through the intervention of Richelieu, then Superintendent of her\r\nhousehold, she introduced that great and wily man into the counsels of\r\nthe king. Richelieu, appointed Prime-Minister, arrested his former\r\nmistress at Compeigne, and threw her friends into the Bastile. The sun\r\nof Mary had finally set; she became an outcast and a wanderer in Europe.\r\nOur own Charles I. found his mother-in-law an asylum; but he himself was\r\nsoon in need of human charity, and the abased queen must needs creep to\r\nCologne, where she lived in obscurity and died--as travellers are still\r\nshown--in a garret. A weak woman, with strong passions. Ambitious,\r\njealous, irascible. In her character, as with all men and women--even\r\nthe worst---there is one brighter spot for contemplation. She introduced\r\ninto France an enlightened and a pure taste for art. There still exist\r\nsome specimens of engraving by her hand. To her, Paris owes the Palace\r\nof the Luxembourg, and, for her, Rubens painted a gallery still\r\npossessed by France.\r\n\r\n  [The companion statuette to 305A.]\r\n\r\n307. LOUIS XIII. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Fontainebleau, 1601. Died at St. Germain, 1643. Aged 42.]\r\n\r\nHe succeeded his father Henry IV. when nine years old. In 1614, his\r\nmajority was declared: in the following year he married Anne of Austria.\r\nHis reign is chiefly remarkable for the ascendancy acquired over the\r\nKing and his government, by Cardinal Richelieu, whose policy, although\r\ndirected by personal ambition, elevated the power of France and prepared\r\nit for the glory of the succeeding reign. Louis XIII. was surnamed “The\r\nJust:” but the good, which he desired, he had neither firmness nor\r\nenlightenment enough to secure. He was timid and diffident, though\r\nscrupulous, sincere, and pious. He had a melancholy nature. Grandeur had\r\nno seductions for him, and it could not be said that he enjoyed the\r\nsweets of private life. His mother Richelieu caused to be banished, and\r\nLouis suffered her to die in misery at Cologne; an unfilial act to be\r\nattributed rather to weakness of character, and the influence of the\r\nCardinal, than to deliberate unkindness. He was the father of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n  [From a fine portrait statue in bronze, by Simon Guillain of Paris,\r\n  who died in 1658. The original is in the Louvre, and a copy of it is\r\n  at Versailles: it has lost a spur and the fleur-de-lys which was at\r\n  the top of the sceptre. The King wears the royal fleur-de-lys mantle\r\n  over his armour, and the grand collar of the Order of the St. Esprit.\r\n  He holds the sceptre in one hand, and stretches out the other, as if\r\n  giving a command. There is an interesting bust at Versailles of the\r\n  same King when a boy, and no doubt from the life.]\r\n\r\n307A. LOUIS XIII. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [From the marble statue in the Louvre, by Guillaume Couston, a pupil\r\n  of Coysevox, who died at Paris in 1746. The King wears the royal\r\n  fleur-de-lys mantle, and on his knees offers his crown and sceptre to\r\n  the Virgin. The 15th of August, 1638, the day on which Louis XIV. was\r\n  born, was ordered to be celebrated by a solemn procession in\r\n  Nôtre-Dame; and throughout France, to this day it is kept in the\r\n  Cathedral, and called the ceremony of the Vow of Louis XIII. The\r\n  attitude chosen by the sculptor is thus explained. There are several\r\n  other examples of the same kind at Versailles; the statue of Louis\r\n  XIV. (No. 308) is one. At Versailles there is a similar statue by\r\n  Coysevox, and a bust by Warin.]\r\n\r\n307.* ANNE OF AUSTRIA. _Queen of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Spain, 1602. Died in France, 1666. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Philip II. of Spain, and wife of Louis XIII. of France.\r\nShe was neglected by the King, her husband, and had no influence in\r\nFrance during his lifetime. But upon his decease, the parliament\r\nannulled his will, which had restricted the Queen’s power, and gave her\r\nthe unlimited Regency of the kingdom, and sole guardianship of her son,\r\nLouis XIV. She appointed Cardinal Mazarin her Prime Minister, and the\r\nalliance thus formed between a Spanish princess and an Italian priest,\r\ngave rise in France to the civil wars of “La Fronde.” In spite of the\r\nopposition which she encountered, she made over the sovereignty of\r\nFrance unimpaired to her son when he reached his majority. Of a mild and\r\ndocile temper, religious and charitable. As a mother she was devoted to\r\nher children, and sought to imbue them with high moral and religious\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n  [Mask from the statue referred to in note No. 308.]\r\n\r\n308. LOUIS XIV. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at St. Germain, 1638. Died 1715. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Louis XIII. and Anne of Austria. He ascended the throne at\r\nfive years old--his mother being Regent during his minority--and reigned\r\n72 years, longer than any other King of France. Until the death of\r\nMazarin in 1661, Louis XIV. suffered the adroit Cardinal to rule. From\r\nthat hour until his own death, no man governed but himself. This\r\nrenowned monarch survived nearly the whole of his family, and when he\r\ndied, the crown, as in his own case, came to the charge of a child--his\r\ngreat grandson--then in his fifth year. The reign of Louis Quatorze was\r\nsingularly eventful within and without the realm. It embraced wars,\r\nmarked now with splendid successes, and now with formidable reverses. He\r\naimed at universal monarchy, and endangered his own. He sustained, in\r\nthe War of the Succession, the defence of Spain and France against\r\nunited Europe--a war in which the allies hoped to dismember France, that\r\ndid not lose a province. Under this king, the soil of France was stained\r\nwith the blood of her children in religious civil conflict; the most\r\nindustrious and the best, slaughtered for their faith, or exiled. A\r\nmagnificent Court surrounded his person--the centre to the politeness of\r\nEurope, its stately decorum veiling great moral corruption. Jealous of\r\nhis prerogatives and of his supremacy amongst kings, Louis XIV. was\r\nstill more jealous to be thought the best bred gentleman of his time. In\r\nthis reign, the marine, the commerce, and the manufactures of France\r\nmade a vast stride. Arts, letters, and science were royally encouraged.\r\nIt is looked back upon as the Augustan age of French literature, when\r\nthe writings of Corneille, Racine, Molière, and Boileau--of Masillon,\r\nBossuet, Fénélon, seemed to have fixed the language. The age of Louis\r\nXIV. was the age of glory to the French monarchy; and splendidly\r\ndissolute, and, in many respects, hollow, as it may have been, we still\r\nrevert to its records with a fascination that never palls, and an\r\ninterest that becomes more acute the more it is gratified.\r\n\r\n  [This statue, representing Louis as a child, is from a bronze by\r\n  Guillain, which formed, with a statue of Anne of Austria, and one of\r\n  Louis XIII., a group of three, as a monument to commemorate the\r\n  building of the Pont-au-Change, begun by Louis XIII. in 1639, and\r\n  finished under Louis XIV., 1647, while Anne was Regent. The monument\r\n  was destroyed in 1787; but the statues are in the Louvre, as well as\r\n  the great bas-relief. The bust of Anne of Austria (No. 307*) is taken\r\n  from the statue.]\r\n\r\n308A.

LOUIS XV. _King of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Versailles, 1710. Died there, 1774. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nHe succeeded his great grandfather, Louis XIV., in the fifth year of his\r\nage. He was styled “the well beloved.” In his 34th year, on the field of\r\nFontenoy, he gave proof of courage. Up to the prime of manhood, he gave\r\nequally satisfactory evidence of many good qualities of heart and head.\r\nBut indolence and vicious habits, subsequently contracted, rendered the\r\nlatter half of Louis’s reign one of the most disgraceful and profligate\r\nthat France had witnessed. The shameless proceedings which had stained\r\nthe career of his guardian, the Regent Orleans, were re-enacted in his\r\nown vicious Court. The disasters of France abroad during this degraded\r\ntime, the destruction of her navy, the financial crisis that followed\r\nthat catastrophe, the corruptions that were eating into the very heart\r\nof the State, and the immorality that characterized the higher classes,\r\nwere the natural forerunners of the frightful storm that burst over\r\nFrance in the following reign. Louis XV., once “the well beloved,” died\r\nexecrated by his subjects, who insulted his wretched remains, as they\r\nwere passing to their last home.\r\n\r\n309A.

Aged 38.]\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate daughter of Francis I., Emperor of Germany, and the\r\nillustrious Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1770, before she was sixteen,\r\nmarried to Louis the Dauphin, who in 1774 became King of France, under\r\nthe title of Louis XVI. At the breaking out of the French Revolution,\r\nevery public disaster was laid to her charge by the maddened people, and\r\nafter the execution of her husband, she was herself condemned to death.\r\nOn her way to the scaffold, she was for two hours reviled by a ferocious\r\nmob; but resignation and sweetness of demeanour only could be traced on\r\nher countenance. Her hair had been turned silvery white by her many\r\ntroubles, and a settled melancholy was stamped on her beautiful\r\nfeatures. After her execution, her body was immediately consumed with\r\nquick lime. The murder of this unhappy lady was the most crimson spot in\r\nall the bloody time of the French Revolution. She was of a playful,\r\nhappy, cheerful disposition, devoted to her family, benevolent to all.\r\nHer purity is beyond question, her heroism perfect. In mixing in public\r\nconcerns, which she did not understand, she betrayed imprudence. In\r\ndespising etiquette she laid herself open to the worst criticisms of her\r\nungenerous foes; but her character shines unsullied after cruel\r\npersecution, horrible imprisonment, and ignominious death.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre by Lecomte.]\r\n\r\n311. NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE. _Emperor of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, 1768. Died at St. Helena, 1821. Aged\r\n  53.]\r\n\r\nA soldier of fortune at the outset of his career. Lieutenant of\r\nArtillery, 1785. First Consul of France, 1799. Emperor of France in\r\n1804, when he was but 36 years of age. Discrowned exile, and prisoner,\r\n1815. The military prodigy of his age. His story reads like a romance of\r\neastern enchantment; for he made and unmade kings at his will, and\r\nconfounding all the established conceptions and expectations of men,\r\nasserted and won his right to fix for a time the destinies of nations.\r\nHis extreme hour of greatness was in 1813, after the fearful retreat\r\nfrom Russia, when in a few months he summoned a new army to his side\r\nfrom the fields of exhausted France, and alone defied, and almost\r\novercame, the united strength of the rest of civilized Europe. The most\r\nignoble period of his life is found on the barren rock of St. Helena,\r\nwhen, treacherous to his former grandeur, he was afflicted and absorbed\r\nby the worthless and passing annoyances of the moment. His career was\r\nthat of a dazzling meteor, astonishing all men in its fiery passage, but\r\ncreating little else than amazement, and admiration mingled with fear.\r\nNot naturally cruel, he enacted cruelties. Brave in the field, he lacked\r\nthe true heroic element. He used all men for his own advancement, and\r\ncounted human life valueless, when its sacrifice might add to his\r\nimagined glory. Superstitious, but not religious. Framed for intensest\r\nexertion, indefatigable, impatient, irritable, untruthful, theatrical,\r\npetty. Yet a grand lawgiver; cognisant of the wants of men, and capable\r\nof meeting them, had his lust of ambition suffered him to provide for\r\nthe interests of his people as sedulously as for his own. His character,\r\na singular conflict of great virtues with small vices, and of great\r\nvices with small virtues. The most splendid soldier since the days of\r\nJulius Cæsar, and the idol of his army. The uncle of Napoleon III., the\r\npresent Emperor of France.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble in the Louvre by Houdon.]\r\n\r\n311A.

NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE. _Emperor of France._\r\n\r\n312. LOUIS PHILIPPE. _King of the French._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Paris, 1773. Died at Claremont, in England, 1850. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nA monarch who ascended the throne of France on the neck of one\r\nRevolution, and was hurled from it by the heel of another. A king who\r\nhad borne adversity bravely in his youth, yet was unequal to sustain\r\nprosperity in his age. The most remarkable example of the proverb that\r\n“a Bourbon learns nothing, and forgets nothing.” If any Bourbon could\r\nprove an exception to the rule, Louis Philippe must have been the man.\r\nHe had great sagacity; he had mixed for many years with all ranks and\r\nconditions of men. He had acutely felt the want of the means of living.\r\nHe had been forced to earn his own bread by humble day labour. He had\r\ntravelled in America, resided in England, had read much, observed more.\r\nYet in 1848, after a reign of 18 years, he conducted himself towards the\r\nFrench nation with a blind obstinacy and wilful disregard of\r\nconsequences, worthy of a sovereign who had been suckled in the lap of\r\ndespotism, and fed for ever afterwards upon obsequious flattery, and all\r\nthe other dainty diet of a Court. Louis Philippe had many good qualities\r\nof heart. He was beloved by his wife and children, and was a true hero\r\nat the domestic hearth. He had also a shrewd, active, well-informed\r\nmind. Nor did he act without a principle in his dealing with his\r\nsubjects. But unfortunately his love for his family led him into foolish\r\nschemes for their advancement, his shrewdness overreached itself, and\r\nhis principle of action was based upon a fallacy. He imagined that he\r\ncould satisfy his people with the very husk and rind of constitutional\r\ngovernment, and flatter them with the conviction that they were chewing\r\nand enjoying the kernel. Corruption was hardly greater in the days of\r\nthe Regency, than towards the untimely close of the reign of Louis\r\nPhilippe, but the rottenness under the later Orleans was veiled beneath\r\nforms demanded by the spirit of the age, and conceded by the King in a\r\nspirit of mock complaisance and quiet irony. Few men have had greater\r\nopportunity than the King of the Barricades. None have so desperately\r\ndisappointed hope and baffled expectation. The history of the House of\r\nOrleans is full of instruction for all who bear the name: but no chapter\r\nis so fraught with momentous interest to the living chief of the House\r\nas that which tells the extraordinary and calamitous history of Louis\r\nPhilippe.\r\n\r\n  [From the Marble, by J. E. Jones, 1845.]\r\n\r\n312*. LOUIS NAPOLEON. _Emperor of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1808. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe third Emperor of the name, and not the least remarkable of his\r\nextraordinary race. The opinions formed of the present Emperor of France\r\nfrom his earlier history, have all been belied by his subsequent career.\r\nHe has been an exile, a prisoner, a wanderer, an outcast. When he has\r\nceased to be an object of suspicion, it was only to become a subject for\r\nridicule. Of all pretenders to thrones in Europe, he has been held the\r\nleast likely to obtain, by any change of circumstances or overthrow of\r\ndynasties, supreme dominion. When kings, in their fear, have reckoned\r\nover the names of those from whom danger might be expected, and have\r\nexhausted the entire list by including all possible representatives of\r\nperil, Louis Napoleon has not been in the number. He lived for years in\r\nLondon, and on the 10th of April, 1848, when special constables were\r\nenrolled for the preservation of menaced order, he sallied forth with\r\nhis neighbours, and performed street duty with the humblest. He was so\r\npoor in England, that his goods were sold to pay his debts. Yet at this\r\nhour the diadem binds his brow, and his foot is firmly planted upon the\r\nsummit of power in tranquillized France, and we all pray Heaven in the\r\ninterests of humanity, civilization, and peace, to maintain it there.\r\nSince the accession of Napoleon III., all his exertions have been\r\ndirected to the development of the material resources of his country,\r\nand to the upholding of that good understanding amongst nations which is\r\nessential to the continuance of social prosperity. Europe lies under\r\ngreat obligations to his sagacity, and England has cause to rejoice in\r\nhis friendship. When he married, he called himself a “_parvenu_.” His\r\nwisdom, moderation, and good faith have attached him to the heart of\r\npublic opinion more closely than though, upon an insincere brow, he had\r\nbrought to his imperial throne the stamp of a hundred kings.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by Barre, 1853.]\r\n\r\n312A. LOUIS NAPOLEON. _Emperor of France._\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by J. E. Jones.]\r\n\r\n312**. EUGÉNIE MARIE GUZMAN. _Empress of France._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1826. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe wife of Napoleon III., before her marriage with whom she was\r\nCountess Montijo of Teba.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nLudwig, King of Bavaria, first conceived the idea of raising a monument\r\nto the national glory of Germany. In the year 1807, he planned the\r\nWALHALLA, a grand hall for the reception of the statues and\r\nportrait-busts of celebrated Germans, borrowing the title of the\r\nstructure from the old Norse language, the name being that of the palace\r\ninto which Odin, the Scandinavian Jupiter, received the souls of the\r\nslain heroes. The idea, however, remained undeveloped until the\r\nimportant part played by the soldiers of Germany in the final overthrow\r\nof Napoleon gave a new impulse to the great scheme of the king. In 1821,\r\nhe entrusted his architect, Leo von Klenze, with the execution of his\r\nplan. But it was not until 1830 that the design was sufficiently matured\r\nfor building; and, after the laying of the first stone, twelve years\r\nwere occupied in consummating the work. The Walhalla was inaugurated\r\nOctober 18th, 1842.\r\n\r\nThe Walhalla stands in a commanding position on the banks of the Danube,\r\nclose to the little town of Donaustauf, and not far from Regensburg. It\r\nis a noble building of the Doric order, resembling the Parthenon of\r\nancient Greece, 230 feet long, 108 feet broad, and 64 feet high, having\r\na colonnade on every side. It is based upon a massive structure of\r\nCyclopean stone work formed into three terraces, and is approached by a\r\ngrand flight of steps.\r\n\r\nThe pediments at each end are filled with marble statues by Ludwig\r\nSchwanthaler. The south, pediment, looking over the river, contains an\r\nallegorical subject designed by Rauch, and sculptured by Schwanthaler.\r\nGermany is here as a female figure surrounded by young warriors, who\r\nrepresent the different States of Germany, presenting to her the chief\r\nfortresses under the form of young women. The north pediment is entirely\r\nby Schwanthaler. It represents the battle between Hermann and Varus.\r\n\r\nThe interior forms a noble highly-decorated hall in the Ionic style,\r\nwith polished marble walls and painted mouldings, the floor being also\r\nrichly inlaid with marbles. The hall is 168 feet long, 48 feet broad,\r\nand 53 feet high. The entablature is supported by 14 Caryatides, treated\r\nas Walkyren, the Chusers of Slaughter in the old Germanic mythology,\r\neach being 10 feet 9 inches high. They are modelled by Schwanthaler, and\r\nexecuted in marble by his pupils; the figures being painted in the\r\nmanner supposed to have been practised by the Greeks: the hair is brown,\r\nthe flesh ivory colour, the tunics are of violet colour, the upper\r\ndrapery white with red and gilt edges, and the bearskins gilt. A frieze\r\nruns round the hall, on which is sculptured the history of the Germans,\r\nfrom their origin in the mountains of the Caucasus to their baptism by\r\nBonifazio. This frieze is the work of Martin Wagner, a Bavarian\r\nsculptor, living at Rome, assisted by Schopf and Pettrich. It is in\r\nmarble, and measures 3 feet 4 inches in height, by 292 feet long.\r\n\r\nSix statues of Victory, larger than life, and sculptured by Rauch, are\r\narrayed round the hall. Between these are placed the busts of the great\r\nmen of Germany, in six groups, numbering, in all, 96. They begin,\r\nchronologically, with Arminius, who repelled the Romans, and King Harry\r\nI. (A.D. 876-936), and come down to Blucher and Schwarzenberg. The Poets\r\nare represented from the medieval Minne and Meister-singers, down to\r\nGoethe and Schiller. All these busts are however modern works of art,\r\nthe earliest dating from 1794.\r\n\r\nThe “Ruhmeshalle” (or “Hall of Fame”), at Munich, contains another\r\ncollection of portrait-busts of celebrated Germans. This, like the\r\nWalhalla, was established by Ludwig, King of Bavaria, and built by the\r\narchitect Klenze. It was commenced in 1843, and completed in 1853. It is\r\nwell situated upon a hill which rises from a flat of some extent near\r\nMunich, called after the Queen of Louis, “die Theresen-Wiese.” It is in\r\nthe Doric style of Greek architecture, 230 feet long, by 150 feet broad,\r\nand 60 feet high, and is surrounded by 48 columns, 24 feet in height.\r\nWithin the 92 metopes are 44 figures of Victory, and 48 representations\r\nof the principal events in the progress of Bavaria, designed and\r\nexecuted by Schwanthaler. The pediments also are ornamented with statues\r\nin marble by the same artist, personifying the provinces of the present\r\nkingdom of Bavaria. The statue of Bavaria, a cast from the head of which\r\nis in the Crystal Palace (See No. 205 of the Handbook of Modern\r\nSculpture), stands in front of the building.\r\n\r\nSome of the German portraits enumerated in the following pages are\r\ncopies from portraits in both collections above referred to. There are\r\nalso some portrait-busts of which the originals exist in the “Royal\r\nMuseum,” and in the “Lager-Haus” at Berlin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(_The German Portraits begin immediately behind the Statue of Sir Robert\r\nPeel at the south-west angle of the Great Transept and Nave._)\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISTS AND MUSICIANS.\r\n\r\n313. PETER PAUL RUBENS. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cologne, in Germany, 1577. Died at Antwerp, in Flanders,\r\n  1640. Aged 63.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most prolific and famous painters; not of the Flemish school\r\nonly, but of the world. His life as untroubled as his genius was grand.\r\nCrowned heads courted him, wealth followed him, and until immediately\r\nbefore his death he knew not the sorrow of sickness. He passed happily\r\nthrough life, multiplying with astonishing rapidity those marvellous\r\npictures which have associated his name for ever with the idea of\r\nglorious colour. He left paintings in France and in Spain, and both\r\ncountries vied with each other in loading the great artist with well\r\nmerited honours. He came to England in the reign of Charles I. as Envoy\r\nfrom the Spanish court, and in England fresh dignities awaited him. As a\r\npainter, he is memorable for the harmony, beauty, and mellow richness of\r\nhis colouring, which flings a surpassing charm over every one of his\r\nproductions. His men are always powerfully drawn and characterized with\r\nwonderful variety; but for the graceful and ideal representation of the\r\nmore delicate sex, we have only the coarse type of his countrywomen. His\r\nportraits are fresh, vigorous, and carefully executed. His most\r\ncelebrated work, _The Descent from the Cross_, at Antwerp, is a\r\nwonderful creation, both for expression and feeling. In landscapes,\r\nRubens was also most happy. In all his works there is a luxuriance of\r\nlife and vigour and passionate expression. In person he was tall,\r\nmajestic, and extremely handsome; in temperament energetic and\r\nenthusiastic; in his manner of living plain and moderate; in his\r\ndealings with his brother artists, gentle and munificent as a prince.\r\nAmongst his pupils he reckoned Vandyke, Teniers the younger, Jordaens,\r\nand Sneyders.\r\n\r\n  [For a description of this noble statue, see No. 107, Handbook of\r\n  Modern Sculpture.]\r\n\r\n314. GEORG FRIEDRICH HANDEL. _Musical Composer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Halle, in Saxony, 1684. Died 1759. Aged 75.]\r\n\r\nThis magnificent musician, the dominant characteristics of whose genius\r\nare grandeur, spirituality, and solemnity, was the son of a surgeon.\r\nHaving in his youth displayed a passionate love for music, and having\r\ntravelled much with the view of gaining instruction in Germany and\r\nItaly, he went to London, at the age of twenty-six, and there composed,\r\nby order of Queen Anne, the “Te Deum” and “Jubilate,” which, in 1714,\r\nwere performed at St. Paul’s. Subsequently became Director of the Opera,\r\nin the Haymarket, for the production of his own works: a large\r\nsubscription, headed by George I., enabling him to open the theatre. The\r\nscheme falling to the ground, in consequence of the quarrels of the\r\nsingers, Handel abandoned the stage, and devoted his powers to the\r\nproduction of those sublime oratorios that have immortalized his name.\r\nIn 1740, he composed “Saul;” in 1741, “The Messiah;” the last a three\r\nweeks’ work. Other great oratorios followed. In 1750, he lost his sight,\r\nand from that time until his death he gradually declined. He was buried\r\nwith great pomp in Westminster Abbey. This mighty musician was infirm of\r\ntemper, and imperfectly educated. When roused, he was violent and\r\nungovernable. A singer once refused to sing one of his airs. Handel,\r\nseizing the man in his arms, and pale with rage, threatened to throw him\r\nout of the window if he persisted in the refusal. His countenance wore a\r\nrough expression, though he was good-natured when not agitated. He\r\nstands at the head of the greatest masters of music; and, as a performer\r\non the organ, he was without a rival.\r\n\r\n  [In the Musical Collection of the Royal Library at Berlin. The artist\r\n  is not known, but it bears many evidences of being a truthful\r\n  portrait, and is altogether a more characteristic head than the\r\n  conventional portrait by Roubiliac No. 314A.]\r\n\r\n314A.

Died at Trieste, in Austria,\r\n  1768. Aged 51.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a shoemaker, and self-educated. At thirty became a Roman\r\nCatholic, and journeyed to Rome, where he studied the antique, and\r\npublished his celebrated. “History of Art.” At Trieste he was murdered\r\nby a felon, for the sake of the medals conferred upon him by the Courts\r\nof Austria and Bavaria. His investigations into the true principles and\r\nsignificance of high art, more especially of antique sculpture, led the\r\nway to the enlightened criticism of Lessing and Goethe.\r\n\r\n  [By Doel. It was placed in the Capitoline Museum at Rome, by Geo. F.\r\n  Reiffenstein.]\r\n\r\n315*. ANTHONY RAPHAEL MENGS. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Aussig, in Bohemia, 1728. Died at Rome, 1771. Aged 43.]\r\n\r\nSurnamed, but without much reason, the Rafaelle of Germany. He studied\r\nassiduously at the Vatican. Upon his return to Germany he was appointed\r\nat Dresden painter to the King. Revisiting Rome he fell in love with a\r\nbeautiful peasant girl, and became a Roman Catholic in order to marry\r\nher. In 1757, he commenced painting in fresco, and his works of this\r\nkind will bear comparison with some of the best of the Italian masters.\r\nIn 1761, he was invited by Charles III. to Spain, where he painted for\r\nthe palace at Madrid, the “Apotheosis of Trajan.” This is his _chef\r\nd’œuvre_. He died leaving scarcely sufficient to pay his funeral\r\nexpenses, and the King of Spain provided for his seven children. The\r\nworks of Mengs display correctness of drawing, vigour of colouring,\r\nfinished execution, and studied grace: but the loftier qualities of\r\nmind, demanded by historical painting, are wanting. He was a writer on\r\nart as well as an artist: and a generous, warm-hearted man.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n316. FRANZ JOSEPH HAYDN. _Musical Composer._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Rohrau, on the frontiers of Austria and Hungary, 1732. Died\r\n  at Vienna, 1809. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nThe son of very poor and humble parents, who cheered their poverty and\r\nsupported their labour by home music. The family concerts constituted\r\nHaydn’s initiation into Art. He was a passionate neophyte. At the age of\r\nthirteen, he had composed a mass, which he was unable to write\r\ncorrectly. Taken into the service of the great master Porpora, he\r\nsubmitted to menial drudgery in order to have the advantage of his\r\ninstruction. In 1760, he entered the better service of Prince Esterhazy,\r\nwith whom, as Court Musician, he continued for the space of twenty-five\r\nyears. During that period, some of his finest symphonies were produced.\r\nIn 1791, he went, on invitation, to London, and continued there for\r\nthirteen years, sending forth his inimitable works, and receiving honour\r\non every side. In 1794, he returned to Germany, established himself in\r\nthe suburbs of Vienna, and composed the oratorio of “The Creation.” He\r\ndied in 1809, from agitation, it is said, induced by the advance upon\r\nVienna of the French army. Haydn is one of the greatest of modern\r\nmusicians. He set free the spirit of instrumental music, and purified\r\nhis art by the purity, simplicity, and beauty of his works. He is\r\nremarkable for lucid melody and for his power of effective painting. His\r\nlabours were enormous and his compositions countless. He could himself\r\nreckon up to 800 works, large and small, and there he stopped.\r\n\r\n317. JOHANN WOLFGANG MOZART. _Musical Composer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Salzburg in Austria, 1756. Died at Vienna, 1791. Aged 35.]\r\n\r\nThe most renowned of German musical composers. His father was a\r\nmusician, and he himself the greatest musical prodigy that ever lived.\r\nIt is alleged upon authority that at four years old, he could already\r\nplay and even compose. It is certain, that before he was eight a harvest\r\nwas in reaping by his family, who travelled over Germany to exhibit his\r\nastounding performances. In 1764, he was in England playing before the\r\nKing and Court. In 1769, he produced an opera, being then 13 years of\r\nage. At 15, he was in Italy, creating wonder by works which rivalled\r\nthose of the great Italian masters. Medals were struck in honour of\r\nyoung Orpheus in the land of art and song. He was not 17 years old when\r\nhe could count as his productions four operas, an oratorio, two masses,\r\nand many other compositions. Mozart grew in years, and did not suffer\r\nthe ordinary penalty of precocity. In him “the child was father to the\r\nman.” The blossom became ripe fruit. In 1781, he produced his opera of\r\n“Idomeneo.” Then followed the “Marriage of Figaro,” and in 1787, his\r\nmasterpiece “Don Giovanni”--a work composed in an incredibly short space\r\nof time. Now came sickness--and the threatening of a complaint allied\r\ntoo frequently to unnatural intellectual development. Symptoms of\r\nconsumption gave rise to melancholy--melancholy to inordinate\r\nlabour--inordinate labour to speedy death. Mozart had the grave already\r\nin sight when he composed his exquisite “Requiem.” This illustrious man\r\nwas the founder of the school in which Beethoven was a faithful\r\ndisciple. His fertility of creation, the rich luxurious beauty of his\r\nmusic, his purity and melody, can hardly be excelled. In all the\r\nrelations of life Mozart was blameless. He had a generous soul, and we\r\nare pained to think so rare and so richly endowed a genius should at any\r\nperiod of his career have suffered anguish from poverty and distress.\r\n\r\n318. KARL FRIEDRICH ZELTER. _Musician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Berlin, 1758. Died 1832. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a master mason, whose trade he followed. Forsaking masonry\r\nfor music, he became the pupil of Fasch, at whose death he was appointed\r\nDirector of the Royal Institute of Music, and Professor of music in the\r\nAcademy of Fine Arts at Berlin. Zelter’s works are chiefly songs and\r\ncompositions for men’s voices, without accompaniment. He also wrote on\r\nthe theory of music. He will be chiefly remembered as the friend and\r\ncorrespondent of Goethe, and the early instructor of Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch, March, 1825.

JOHANN GOTTFRIED SCHADOW. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Berlin, 1764. Died there, 1850. Aged 86.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a poor tailor. He evinced, at an early age, a great love for\r\nthe fine arts, but he was one of many children, and there was small hope\r\nof gratifying fine-art tastes in the needy household. Fortune brought\r\nthe youngster in contact with a sculptor, who taught him drawing, and\r\nfrom that moment his destiny was fixed. Whilst receiving instruction, he\r\nran off with a girl to whom he was attached, married her at Vienna, and\r\nwith the consent and at the expense of his stepfather, proceeded to\r\nRome. There for two years he laboured hard as a sculptor, in the Vatican\r\nand in the Capitol. In 1788, he had already advanced far enough to be\r\nappointed Court Sculptor at Berlin. In 1822, he was made Director of the\r\nAcademy of Fine Arts in the same city. His works, numerous and of a high\r\norder, are found in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany. He was one of the\r\nfirst who opposed to the insipid and conventional idealism of the\r\neighteenth century, a vigorous and truthful representation of nature,\r\nheightened by noble intellectuality. This is especially visible in his\r\nportrait statues. He was a worthy precursor of Rauch, who is one of his\r\nmost famous followers. To his eldest son, Rudolph Schadow, also a\r\ndistinguished sculptor, belong the specimens of modern sculpture which\r\nappear under the name of Schadow in this collection. The second son,\r\nWilhelm Schadow, is one of the most celebrated painters in Germany, and\r\nPresident of the Academy at Düsseldorf. Both have a greater name as\r\nartists than the father.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch, 1811. Plaster. The original is in the studio of Rauch.]\r\n\r\n320. ALBERT BARTHOLOMÄUS THORWALDSEN. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1770. Died 1844. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nHe was born, as he said, at Copenhagen: some say in Iceland: some at\r\nsea, between. His father, an Icelander, was employed in carving heads\r\nfor ships in the Royal Dockyard, on which the great sculptor practised\r\nhis young hand: his mother was a priest’s daughter. He was educated, as\r\nall the children of workmen, in the _Holm_, or dockyard, at the King’s\r\nexpense. At 11, Thorwaldsen was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in\r\nCopenhagen. At 17, he first secured attention, and gained the small\r\nsilver medal; at 19, the large. At 21, he won the small, at 23, the\r\nlarge gold medal. His birthday he did not know, but he called it March\r\n8th, the day of his arriving at Rome in 1796. In the Eternal City he\r\naddicted himself to the antique. He brought introductions to Zoega the\r\nDane, then living at Rome, a learned and antiquarian connoisseur. Zoega\r\ndealt kindly and hardly with the young sculptor, severely criticizing\r\nhis labours; and Thorwaldsen, under his critic’s censure, and from his\r\nown dissatisfaction, destroyed numerous attempts. His first “Jason with\r\nthe Golden Fleece,” of the natural size, made no impression, and he\r\nbroke it in pieces. He made it again, 8¹⁄₂ feet high. It secured general\r\nadmiration, and this time he did not destroy his work. He had, however,\r\nmade up his mind to go home; his small preparation was completed; Jason\r\nwas to be sent after him; but a mistake in a passport created a day’s\r\ndelay. During the short interval, Thomas Hope, a well-known name in\r\nEngland, entered the artist’s studio, and saw the “Jason.” The price was\r\nasked. “Six hundred zecchini.” “I will give eight hundred,” answered\r\nThomas Hope. Thorwaldsen stopped in Rome, and now began and went on, his\r\nmightier career. His chief works are classical subjects--some Christian,\r\nto which he drew late in life. The most popular of all his productions\r\nis the bas-relief of “Priam and Achilles.” In 1819, he returned to\r\nCopenhagen, but not permanently until 1838. In Rome he was the friend of\r\nCanova, who acknowledged his merit. His health was often very weak, and\r\nhe died suddenly at a theatre. He was simple in his manners, and\r\nbeloved. In fire and grandeur he resembled Michael Angelo. The old\r\nScandinavian energetic blood rolled in his veins. The family tradition\r\nmade him descended from one of those early warrior-kings: a more\r\nglorious, innocent conqueror.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Plaster. 1816. Done at Rome. A fine artist-like head.

Aged\r\n  57.]\r\n\r\nThis great composer was taught music from his childhood; but it was not\r\nuntil his twelfth year that he at all developed his genius. Sent to\r\nVienna, he was placed there under the care of the Chapel-Master,\r\nAlbrechtsberger, in spite of whose cold and conventional instruction he\r\nadvanced in knowledge and strength, and excited general attention by his\r\nextraordinary gift of improvisation, and marvellous execution. In 1805,\r\nhe composed “Fidelio;” then followed his oratorio of “Christ on the\r\nMount of Olives,” the “Heroic” and “Pastoral” symphonies, and his\r\npianoforte Concertos. At this time Beethoven had scarcely the means of\r\nsubsistence, and to save him from want, a pension of four thousand\r\nflorins was settled upon him by the Austrian government. He fixed his\r\nabode at the village of Baden, near Vienna, and his life became one of\r\nretirement and self-nurture. He composed his music in his solitary\r\nrambles. The wildest scenery to him was the choicest, for he shrank from\r\nintercourse with men. His habits were known and respected. He died\r\nunmarried. From his twenty-sixth year he had been deaf; but he was\r\notherwise robust. He was passionately fond of Scott’s romances, and\r\nthese works, with the “Odyssey” of Homer, were his consolations during\r\nthe illness of which he died. His fertility and variety of production\r\nare marvellous. The passionate soul of melody possessed him. His works\r\nare rich in harmony, tinctured it may be with the delicate mysticism\r\nthat ruled his genius in its silent haunts.\r\n\r\n  [By Ernst Hähnel, of Dresden. Plaster. 1847.

Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nAt sixteen, Paer began to write for the stage. Before he was twenty-six\r\nhe had already produced twenty-two operas, all in the conventional style\r\nof the old Italian operas, and after the manner of Cimarosa and\r\nPaisiello. After 1797, a laudable change is remarked in his style--more\r\nforce in the harmonies, more variety in the modulations, with richer and\r\nmore effective instrumentation. In 1801, appointed by the Elector of\r\nSaxony Chapel-Master in Dresden, and, favoured by the repose afforded\r\nhere, Paer still improved his style. In 1806, Dresden was taken by the\r\nFrench. The musician transferred his services to Napoleon, and\r\naccompanied his new master to Paris. In 1810, revisited his native city,\r\nand there composed his master-piece, the opera of Agnèse. His subsequent\r\ncareer is remarkable for little more than for petty intrigues against\r\nrival composers, and--after his appointment as Director of the Italian\r\nOpera in Paris in 1812--for miserable squabbles with actors and\r\nmusicians. He ceased to be an artist, and condescended to become a mere\r\ncourtier and “homme de salon.” His death was accelerated by\r\nlong-continued habits of intemperance. Paer was gifted with great\r\nfluency, and his works have brilliancy and spirit; but he is without\r\noriginality, force, and dramatic power.\r\n\r\n  [Bust to come.]\r\n\r\n322.

Brother to the celebrated poet and critic, and\r\nthe friend of Rauch, with whom he was engaged in illustrating in\r\nsculpture the glories of the late war. His productions are in various\r\nparts of Germany, and are held in high estimation. He is the sculptor of\r\nthe statue of Frederic William at Ruppen, and of the front gate of the\r\ncathedral at Berlin.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Marble. 1825.

Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe leading German sculptor of his day--endowed with great imaginative\r\npowers, and excelling in portraits, which, under his treatment, exhibit\r\ntruth and nature, intimately associated with poetic elevation. In 1804,\r\nhe took his way from Berlin to Rome, and presently secured the\r\nfriendship of Thorwaldsen, whose love for the antique greatly influenced\r\nand directed his taste. Whilst at Rome he executed “Mars and Venus\r\nwounded by Diomedes,” a colossal bust of the King of Prussia, and other\r\ncelebrated works. In 1811, invited by the King of Prussia to Berlin, he\r\nproduced many colossal statues and countless busts. His colossal\r\n“Victories,” for the Walhalla, and the equestrian monument of Frederic\r\nthe Great, are well known efforts of his genius. A great\r\nartist--competent to express vigorously, truthfully, and naturally,\r\nhistorical rather than ideal conception.\r\n\r\n  [By F. Tieck. Plaster. 1825.

Employed by the\r\nKing of Prussia to erect those structures in his capital which have\r\nstamped a new character on Berlin, and endowed it with high\r\narchitectural claims. He gave a new impulse to his art, both by his\r\ninfluence and his example, and was besides a generous and amiable man.\r\n\r\n  [By F. Tieck, 1819. The marble bust is in the Berlin Museum. A copy in\r\n  bronze is on the staircase of the Royal Theatre, Berlin.]\r\n\r\n325. LEO VON KLENZE. _Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Hildesheim, in Hanover, 1784. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe architect, in Munich, of “The Glyptothek,” and the constructor of\r\nmany works, Royal and otherwise, in the same city. Also the designer of\r\nthe plans for the “Walhalla.” Author of some literary productions\r\nbearing upon his art. In 1844, accompanied Ludwig I. to Greece to\r\nexamine the plans already made for the improvement of Athens, and to\r\nsuggest original designs. Klenze possesses great decorative skill, and a\r\ncomprehensive knowledge of the history of architecture; but the true\r\ngenius and high faculty of composition appears on few of his\r\nproductions. He does not take what is universal in the various styles\r\nwith which his mind is familiar, in order to form a style expressive of\r\nhis own spirit, and suitable to the country and climate in which it is\r\nhis business to exhibit it, but he borrows his structures from Greece\r\nand Italy, and deposits them in Munich, loading the city with specimens\r\nof foreign styles of architecture. His effects are undoubtedly\r\npicturesque, and the decorations of his buildings always beautiful, but\r\nfault is found with the internal arrangements of his edifices, with the\r\nlowness of the apartments, and with the bases of his façades, which are\r\noccasionally mean and even vulgar.\r\n\r\n  [By J. Halbig. Plaster. 1846. Executed for King Ludwig.]\r\n\r\n326. PETER CORNELIUS. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Düsseldorf, in Prussia, 1787. Still living.]\r\n\r\nA renowned painter of the later German school. He studied under Langer,\r\na disciple of the old school, who made enormous efforts to suppress the\r\nromantic tendencies of his pupil, to check his imagination, and to\r\nrestrain his boldness. By a visit to Italy, however, Cornelius confirmed\r\nthe bent of his genius, and rendered the good intentions of Herr Langer\r\nof no avail. His indomitable perseverance, hard study, and rare gifts,\r\nsoon enabled him to outstrip all rivalry. Whilst still young he was\r\ninvited to direct at Düsseldorf the School of Painting, which has proved\r\nitself one of the most careful and successful nursing-mothers of Art in\r\nGermany. In 1819, engaged by the King of Bavaria to decorate the Museum\r\nof Sculpture then constructing at Munich. The subjects painted by\r\nCornelius in fresco for this Museum from the heroic myths of Homer and\r\nHesiod, are conceived with a rich imagination, and executed with\r\nsuperior power. His cartoons illustrating the old “Nibelungen-Lied,”\r\nand the “Faust” of Goethe, are equally remarkable. In 1825, appointed\r\nDirector of the Academy of Painting at Munich. In 1841, summoned to\r\nBerlin by the King of Prussia, for whom Cornelius designed the “Shield\r\nof Faith,” presented by his Majesty to his godson, the Prince of Wales.\r\nCornelius paints with the passionate sensibility and delicate perception\r\nof a true poet. His copious imagination is never at fault, and his\r\nability to produce is as striking as his faculty of conception. Yet he\r\nnever oversteps the modesty of nature, or the confines of true art. He\r\nis the worthy leader of a daily increasing school in Germany, which\r\nattempts, and not unsuccessfully, to unite in art earnestness of\r\nthought, activity, boldness, and freedom.\r\n\r\n  [By E. Hähnel. Plaster. 1852. In the possession of the artist.

CHRISTOPH GLUCK. _Musician._\r\n\r\n  [Born in the early part of the 18th century. Died at Vienna, 1787.]\r\n\r\nThe great merit of Gluck is that he emancipated music from the trammels\r\nof conventionalism and false taste, and made it the exponent and\r\nminister of poetry and the drama. Gluck, invited to London in 1745 to\r\ncelebrate in music the butcheries of the Duke of Cumberland, found that\r\nthe operas represented there were mere concerts, for which the drama was\r\na pretext. Sound was everything, meaning nothing. His own music was set\r\nto words with which it had no connexion, and, torn from its original\r\ncontext, lost all its effect. This fact led him to the discovery of the\r\ngreat principle which is the key to the rest of his life: viz., that\r\nmusic is not merely a pleasant arrangement of sounds intended to gratify\r\nthe ear, but a subsidiary language, able to exalt and strengthen the\r\nemotions, raised by the measure and force of the spoken language to\r\nwhich it is allied. In 1761, he composed his opera of “Alceste,” as an\r\nillustration of his idea. It was followed in 1762 and 1763 by “Paris and\r\nHelena” and “Orpheus.” In 1779, he composed the “Iphigenia in Tauride,”\r\nthe greatest of his works. Wieland has happily expressed Gluck’s claim\r\nupon our respect in a sentence. “He preferred,” he says, “the Muses to\r\nthe Syrens.” His works are not so much operas, in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe term, as poems, in which music is employed for producing and\r\nsustaining emotion. Off the stage Gluck was nothing, but upon it the\r\nmusician was himself a poet. The manners of Gluck, like those of\r\nBeethoven and Handel, were rough and blunt. He was large in person; and\r\nhis habits were indolent and somewhat sensual. The bust discloses the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n  [From the Terracotta, by Houdon.

Aged 55.]\r\n\r\nThe chief architect in Munich since the withdrawal of Klenze. His most\r\nimportant work is the new Library in that city, which is remarkable for\r\nthe simple magnificence of its façade. He designed the Palace of King\r\nOtho at Athens, and he re-opened the quarries of Pentelicus, which had\r\nnot been employed since the days of Hadrian. Upon the departure of\r\nCornelius from Munich, Gärtner received the appointment of Director of\r\nthe Royal Academy of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\n  [By Johann Halbig.]\r\n\r\n329. JULIUS SCHNORR. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Leipzig, in Saxony, 1794. Still living.]\r\n\r\nFirst studied under his father, who was Director of the Academy at\r\nLeipzig. In 1811, went to Vienna to get instruction there; but found\r\nlittle to gratify his taste, or to encourage his genius. In 1817,\r\ntravelled into Italy, and there made the acquaintance of Ludwig, then\r\nCrown Prince of Bavaria. At Rome worked at the Villa Massimi, where\r\nCornelius was also employed, and where he produced in the space of five\r\nyears his eleven frescos from the Orlando Furioso of Ariosto. Called to\r\nMunich in 1827, he received there the appointment of Professor of\r\nHistorical Painting in the Academy, and painted for the King of Bavaria\r\nhis admirable frescos illustrating “The Nibelungen-Lied.” In 1846,\r\naccepted an invitation to Dresden. Schnorr is chiefly known to us by his\r\nbeautiful illustrations of the Bible. Amongst all the fresco painters of\r\nMunich he stands unrivalled for combining individual life with ideal\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n  [From the plaster model by Ernst Rietschel, dated 1848.

Aged 46.]\r\n\r\nMost of his numerous and admirable works adorn his native city. His\r\nmasterpiece is the colossal statue of Bavaria, cast in bronze, 54 feet\r\nhigh. The noble head of this figure forms a remarkable object in our\r\nCourt of German and English Sculpture. Before its inauguration the\r\nartist had died, having been an invalid for the last fifteen years of\r\nhis life. Many casts from the works of Schwanthaler may be found in the\r\nCourt of Modern German Sculpture. He had the advantage of being an\r\nexcellent classical scholar, and was besides a warm-hearted, unassuming\r\nman, simple in his manners, full of wit and humour, and a true friend.\r\nAs an artist he had a fine classic feeling, great spirit and fire, a\r\nstrong imagination, a vigorous and creative genius.\r\n\r\n  [By Xavier Schwanthaler.

FELIX MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY. _Musician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Berlin 1809. Died at Leipzig 1847. Aged 38.]\r\n\r\nThe grandson of the Jewish philosopher, Moses Mendelssohn, and the son\r\nof an eminent banker. Like Mozart he exhibited an astonishing precocity.\r\nIn his twentieth year he was already a musical composer of great\r\noriginality. Then setting out on his travels, he visited London, Paris,\r\nand various parts of Italy. In 1834, appointed Chapel-Master at\r\nDüsseldorf. In that city he produced, when 27 years old, his oratorio of\r\n“St. Paul.” It won the success it merited. In 1839, he composed his\r\n“Lobgesang,” or “Hymn of Praise,” by many regarded as his masterpiece.\r\nIn 1846, his marvellous oratorio of “Elijah” was produced at Birmingham.\r\nFrom this period his mental activity was prodigious, and his production\r\nceaseless. He died, literally consumed by the fire within him. He was a\r\ngreat man. His faculties, of the highest order, were engaged in the\r\nadvancement of the purest art. His manner was unaffected, his heart warm\r\nand affectionate. He loved England. His earliest works indicate his\r\ngenius; his latest compositions are tinged with a deeper, and more\r\nsolemn hue--but all he did was beautiful--like his mind.\r\n\r\n  [By E. Rietschel.

Died at Hamburgh,\r\n  1803. Aged 79.]\r\n\r\nGoethe said well of Klopstock, that to him German literature owed a debt\r\nof gratitude, for he was in advance of his time, although he lived long\r\nenough for his time to be in advance of him. He is the classical epic\r\npoet of Germany, as Milton of England, but with a difference. Milton\r\nwas nurtured on the overflowing bosom of English poesy. Klopstock had\r\nimbibed no such strength at a native fount. The sublime utterance of the\r\none still reverberates through a world that is still the wiser and the\r\nbetter for the heavenly strain. The sonorous rhapsodies of the other\r\nalready weary the ear of the land on which they originally fell with\r\nweight and power. Few were the admirers of England’s blind poet when he\r\nsang “of Man’s first disobedience.” To-day they are countless. When\r\nKlopstock published the first part of “The Messiah,” Germany was\r\nenthusiastic. The learned were at his feet, kings craved his\r\ncompanionship, and the people worshipped a prophet. To-day, a young\r\nGerman critic has the hardihood to say--without being stoned for his\r\nheresy--that Klopstock’s poems are like nothing so much as translations\r\nfrom some unknown author, by an erudite but somewhat unpoetical\r\nphilologist. With the early admiration for the poet, was mingled awe for\r\nthe sanctity with which his subject had enveloped his person. He became\r\nin a nation, what Pollock, the author of “The Course of Time,” has been\r\namongst a class. If he is now taken down from his undue eminence, his\r\njust claims to respect must not be disregarded. If Luther constituted an\r\nepoch in the moral and intellectual emancipation of his country,\r\nKlopstock marked an era in the progress of her poesy. Both names are\r\nlandmarks, in the history of the language, as cultivated in the service\r\nof letters. The latter was, also, a pioneer and a reformer. His odes are\r\nstriking and lofty; his learning extensive; his piety fervent; and his\r\npoetic sensibility profound. The thirst of communing with the soul of\r\nhis native Germany--since, a widely-possessing enthusiasm--announced\r\nitself as a literary virtue, first in Klopstock’s writings. It spoke in\r\nthe selection of some of his themes: but was chiefly operative in his\r\nprofound and enamoured study of the language which begins, in his verse,\r\nto discover and lavish exuberant wealth.\r\n\r\n  [By Dannecker.]\r\n\r\n335. GOTTHOLD EPHRAIM LESSING. _Man of Letters._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Camentz, in Saxony, 1729. Died at Brunswick, 1781. Aged 52.]\r\n\r\nA philosopher and a poet, but more of an investigator than of a creator.\r\nNevertheless, a strong renovator. He is named by Germany of to-day with\r\ngratitude, amongst those who loosened the old chains of imitation from\r\nher literature, and summoned her to think and to write, self-conscious,\r\nfrom her own deep and powerful spirit. Powerlessly enough, her drama,\r\ntill his time, was borrowed from that of a people, geographically\r\ndivided from her by a river--intellectually, her antipodes. Lessing\r\nshowed her, in place of Corneille and Racine, a foreigner, in whose\r\nkindred veins her own blood ran; and called her to Nature and to\r\nherself, in calling her to SHAKSPEARE. Lessing was a critic in plastic\r\nart; witness his “Laocoon.” He was a fabulist of great invention, fancy,\r\nand humour: witness his “Fables,” which may take rank with those of\r\nÆsop. He was a dramatist of skill, power, and pathos: witness his\r\n“Nathan the Wise,” and his “Emilia Galotti.” Above all, he was an\r\nindependent thinker; and a style clear, precise, and masterly, runs\r\nthrough all his writings. He is one of those now elder classics through\r\nwhom the language of the country has risen into literary rank and\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n  [By Ernst Rietschel. Bronze. 1849.

Died 1813. Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nAn exquisite artist in words, herein resembling though more enchanting\r\nthan, Lessing, whose contemporary he was. He might seem to be a\r\ntransitionist; softening the passage from the imitative French school in\r\nGermany, to the pure German. Or you may suspect that the foreign element\r\nis not French, but Italian, if modern,--or Attic, if ancient. For he was\r\na student of classic antiquity, and a lightness of grace, and a mobile\r\nsensibility to the beautiful, which are not German, reign over his\r\nnumerous writings in prose and verse. Some of his works are direct\r\nimitations from the Greek--as his Dialogues after Lucian. His elaborate\r\nphilosophical romance, “Agathon,” lays the scene in old Greece. But his\r\ngift is an unrivalled ease in the flow of his narrative verse--lively or\r\nserious--made alluring by perpetual representation to the eye; and\r\nroving with predilection amidst romantic scenes and adventures. His poem\r\nof “Oberon” is a masterpiece in this kind. He seems to have prepared for\r\nit in studying Ariosto, but engrafting upon the Italian style the more\r\npicturesque of his own northern and later poetry. The qualities missed\r\nin this rich, enticing, and luxurious word-painter, are profound\r\npassion, intellectual might, and the more solemn contemplation of the\r\nuniverse, natural and spiritual. Wieland was a scholar: you feel the\r\ninfluence of his reading at every step; but the springs in his own bosom\r\nwell freely.\r\n\r\n  [The original marble, by Schadow, is the property of Henry Crabbe\r\n  Robinson, Esq. of London.

One\r\n  cast has been allowed to be taken for the Crystal Palace; and the\r\n  mould has been destroyed.]\r\n\r\n337. JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in Germany, 1749. Died at Weimar, in\r\n  Germany, 1832. Aged 83.]\r\n\r\nFor comprehensiveness and grasp of thought, for profound knowledge of\r\nhuman life and dealings, for intellectual prowess, for intimate\r\nacquaintance with various and opposing arts and sciences, Goethe stands\r\nalone in Europe throughout the period which he elevated by his presence\r\nand swayed by his achievements. He was a great poet, an excellent\r\ndramatist, a fine novelist, a skilled naturalist; with chemistry,\r\nbotany, and anatomy he was familiar. In truth, it is not easy to limit\r\nthe immense domain through which his giant mind ranged at its will,\r\nconquering and acquiring wherever it touched. His productions are\r\nvoluminous, corresponding to the wealth of his overflowing brain. His\r\n“Faust” predominates far above his other works in popular impression. It\r\nis the one in which he seems the most resolutely to have committed\r\nhimself to his subject. Wild, audacious, lying as this does desperately\r\nout of the Real and the Possible, he throws himself into his enterprise,\r\ndoing it justice, with all his gathered might. We have a feeling\r\npersuasion of this having been his own favorite work, to which he most\r\nconfided, with love, the intimacies of his genius. The recognition of\r\nFaust, as a high work of art, must, however, be restrained to the first\r\npart. In the second the poet seems as though self-bewitched. Certainly,\r\nGermany never has possessed so consummate a master, in art, of her\r\nwords. His lyrics are gems of music. They have the _felt_ charm of\r\ngrace, rather than demonstrable worth. In the verse of Schiller it is\r\nthe other way. Ask of his Germany what constitutes the all-extolled\r\nmerit of Goethe, and you will hear for answer:--“He is the great\r\nworld-sage.” But some of the elements of true wisdom he unquestionably\r\nlacked. Admit all his strength, his knowledge, his skill, his intuition,\r\nand you still miss the heart lodged by Mother Nature in the bosoms of\r\nHomer, of Shakspeare, of the compatriot and contemporary Schiller;\r\nwhich, warm and large, embraced with loving and devout sympathy all that\r\nis great and high in the souls of men. You desire, in many of his\r\npersonages, the beating pulses of simple, natural, human affection; the\r\nexuberance of genial and generous passion;--in himself, the possessing\r\nand tyrannizing enthusiasm, proper to the vowed follower of the Muse.\r\nHis _judgments_ of the world show distinguished capacity, but his\r\n_pictures_ are not generic representations of Man, either as reality\r\ngives him in experience to every one of us, or as poesy would select\r\nhim. Goethe promulgated speculations on plants and colours that have\r\nbeen received into science. He made other speculations during his mighty\r\nand protracted career, which passed into the spirit of more than one\r\ngeneration, to influence, guide, advance, fashion, and direct it.\r\n\r\n  [By Alexander Frippel, 1789.

FRIEDRICH CHRISTOPH VON SCHILLER. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Marbach, in Germany, 1759. Died at Weimar, 1805. Aged 46.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Germans, Schiller stands second in the list of their\r\ngreat poets, Goethe being the first; but in the esteem of the rest of\r\nthe world, Schiller is pre-eminently the greatest of German poets. In\r\nuniversality, breadth and power, his genius yields to that of his\r\nillustrious rival; but in delicacy of perception, refinement of feeling,\r\nintense sympathy with the passions he represents, exquisite purity of\r\nthought and diction, and in the treatment of ideal beauty, he is without\r\na competitor in his own country. His manifest delight in the delineation\r\nof pure and generous characters is not the least grateful of his\r\nexcellences. His poetry is the bright intellectual reflexion of his own\r\nchastened spirit, as the writings of Goethe constitute the masculine and\r\nmighty expression of his essentially sensual nature. The German stage\r\nwas formed by Schiller, whose later tragedies gave to the drama of his\r\ncountry a rank that it had never held before. At the outset of his\r\ncareer Schiller studied law, then medicine; and whilst his own tastes\r\nwould have led him to the pastoral office, he found himself, at the age\r\nof 30, appointed to the Chair of History at Jena. His acknowledged\r\ngreatest work is the tragedy of “Wallenstein.” He died of consumption,\r\nand was buried with public honours. He conferred dignity upon the\r\nliterature of his country, and helped, more than any other man of his\r\ntime, to bring it abreast of the poetry of other nations; but the\r\noriginality, beauty, and force of his productions are not more worthy of\r\ncontemplation, than the aspiring grandeur and nobility of his moral\r\ncharacter. He was the friend and pupil of Goethe. The teacher was the\r\nmore consummate artist, the disciple was the purer man. Schiller exalts\r\nour idea of humanity, Goethe lowers it.\r\n\r\n  [By Dannecker. Marble. 1805.

LUDWIG TIECK. _Author._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Berlin, 1773. Recently deceased.]\r\n\r\nA writer in literature and art, who has exercised a sensible influence\r\nupon the minds of contemporary authors. His narratives reveal a powerful\r\nimagination and a profound sense of the beautiful. In his “Zerbino” he\r\nexhibited his ideas on general æsthetics. A visit to England in 1818\r\ninspired him with the idea of translating the plays of Shakspeare, and\r\nhe undertook this labour in conjunction with W. Schlegel. The\r\ntranslation is perhaps the best that has ever been made in any language\r\nof our great poet. At the early period of his literary career, Tieck\r\ndelighted in the marvellous and fantastic. In 1820, his genius took a\r\nnew direction, and built upon an historical foundation, and upon\r\nobservation of actual life. The present King of Prussia charged Tieck\r\nwith the direction of the theatre at Berlin, and conferred upon him a\r\npension. Many of his works have been translated into English--two by\r\nBishop Thirlwall.\r\n\r\n  [By F. Tieck. Plaster. 1836. In the Lager-Haus. The original model was\r\n  done at Dresden.]\r\n\r\n340. BERTHOLD AUERBACH. _Poet and Novelist._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1812. Still living.]\r\n\r\nOf Jewish parents, and originally intended for theological pursuits.\r\nCompleting his education in 1832, he abandoned Rabbinical lore for the\r\nstudy of history, philosophy, and general literature. In 1841, he\r\npublished a life of Spinosa, to whose doctrines he was deeply attached,\r\nand a translation of that philosopher’s complete writings. In 1843, he\r\nproduced a much more popular and generally interesting work, “Village\r\nHistories of the Black Forest,” which has been translated into English,\r\nDutch, and Swedish. Since 1845, Auerbach has resided either at Weimar or\r\nLeipzig. He is zealous in the cause of popular education, and, during\r\nthe commotions of 1848, took part with the moderate democrats.\r\n\r\n  [By Ernst Rietschel. Medallion. 1847.

Died there,\r\n  1468.]\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the early history of Gutenberg, save that he was\r\nborn of a patrician family. In 1427, he resided at Strasburgh. When and\r\nwhere his first attempt at printing was made, it is impossible to say,\r\nfor he never affixed his name, nor the date of printing to any of his\r\nproductions. About 1438 he first employed moveable types made of wood.\r\nIn 1443, he quitted Strasburgh, and returned to his native place. There\r\nhe met with one John Faust, a rich goldsmith, and engaged with him to\r\nestablish a printing-press, Faust finding the money for the undertaking.\r\nThe press was established, and then, for the first time, the Bible was\r\nprinted in Latin. Business went on prosperously for a time. But, four\r\nhundred years ago, it fared with great discoverers and great\r\nspeculations as at the present hour. Faust had made large advances, and\r\nGutenberg could not meet the claim. The pair went to law; and, as it\r\nfalls out in these cases, the goldsmith got the verdict. He retained the\r\nbusiness. Gutenberg was thrown upon the world. There he found a friend,\r\nwas set upon his feet, and established another press. In 1837, a\r\nsplendid monument, by Thorwaldsen, was erected to the memory of\r\nGutenberg in his native town, where the members of the Gutenberg\r\nSociety--to which many of the writers of the Rhenish provinces\r\nbelong--meet to celebrate his mighty discovery, and to do honour to his\r\nname. Who shall fix the merit or assess the claims, or tell the\r\ninfluence exercised in the world by the portentous labours, of “The\r\nInventor of Printing?”\r\n\r\n  [By E. Von Launitz. Plaster. 1840.

Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nThe founder of a new philosophy in Germany. After twelve years’\r\nmeditation, he produced, in the space of five months, his celebrated\r\n“Criticism of Pure Reason.” His main theory is, that there is only one\r\nsource of knowledge, viz., the union of subject and object; that is to\r\nsay, our knowledge is partly _mental_, partly _physical_,--one half of\r\nit coming from the mind, or _subject_, the other half from the _object_.\r\nThe mind has its own forms which it gives to objects. Time and space are\r\nforms of the mind, not things existing out of it. By thus restoring to\r\nmind its independent activity he was able to oppose Locke, proving that\r\nwe have ideas independently of experience, and to oppose Hume, by\r\nproving that these ideas have a character of universality, necessity,\r\nand irresistibility. Hume insisted that the understanding is\r\ntreacherous. Kant declared it is only limited. For a time, Kant’s\r\nphilosophy superseded every other system in the Protestant Universities\r\nof Germany. A man of high intellectual endowment; his life rigorously\r\nphilosophical. He lived and died a type of the German Professor. The\r\ncathedral clock of Königsberg, which town he never once quitted during\r\nhis long life, was not more punctual, it was said, than Immanuel Kant.\r\n\r\n  [By Fried. Hagemann.

Aged 82.]\r\n\r\nIn a year of great dearth and distress to a Swiss Canton, he found\r\nhimself in charge of half a hundred ragged and wretched children--in an\r\nempty barn for a school--with hardly bread for them and him, and wholly\r\nwithout books, or any other usual implements of that industry; but with\r\na heart yearning and overflowing in love towards his little helpless\r\nones, and with an intellect singularly given to resolve the complex\r\nforms of knowledge into the primitive elements fitted, by their evidence\r\nand their simplicity, for the tender and opening mind to receive. So\r\ndriven and so gifted “he made every child its own book.” These emphatic\r\nwords of the narrative tell the secret of that genius with which he\r\nafterwards renovated instruction for the schools of Europe. To draw\r\nforth power--to invite the native energies into spontaneous action--to\r\nlead on the pupil, step after step, in creating thought, in\r\ninvestigating and constructing, how slowly soever, knowledge for\r\nhimself--to foster intelligence under the kindliest influences, like a\r\nplant that wins growth in dews and sunshine, in soft airs and\r\nshowers--was the new and living scholastic art which Pestalozzi opposed\r\nto the old tyranny of inflexible rote, rule, and routine. But\r\nintellectual training alone, he held for vain and pernicious. The roots\r\nmust strike and feed in the soil of the religious, rightly-governed\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n  [Marble. 1809.

Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest practical physicians that Germany has produced. In\r\n1779, he published the first volume of his most famous work, the “System\r\nof Medical Police,” which he states to have cost him ten years intense\r\nstudy. Was Professor of medicine at Göttingen. In 1795, invited to\r\nVienna by the Emperor with commission to reform the medical department\r\nof the army. In 1804, charged by the Emperor Alexander with the\r\nformation of a chemical school at Wilna; and subsequently received many\r\ntempting offers from Napoleon to establish himself in France. Has\r\nwritten many interesting works in connexion with his profession; but his\r\nfame as a writer rests upon the publication already mentioned.\r\n\r\n  [The bust, which is to come, is by Rauch, in bronze. 1841.

FRIEDEICH HEINRICH JACOBI. _Philosopher and Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Düsseldorf, 1743. Died at Munich, 1819. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a merchant whose business he followed in spite of his great\r\nfondness for literature, until an official appointment in his native\r\ncity enabled him to devote his whole time to study. In 1777, he\r\npublished “Friendship and Love,” a philosophical poem, and in the same\r\nyear was invited to Munich, where he was made Privy Councillor. In 1781,\r\nhe had a sharp controversy with Mendelssohn, respecting the doctrines of\r\nSpinosa. In 1804, he assisted in the formation of the Academy of\r\nSciences at Munich, of which institution he became President in 1807.\r\nHis work published in 1811, upon “Divine Things and Revelation,”\r\ninvolved him in bitter discussion with Schelling. Jacobi was a\r\nphilosophical critic, rather than the founder of a distinct\r\nphilosophical system, and his polemical works did good service to\r\nphilosophy by weeding false theories from systems already in existence.\r\nHe was an honest, diligent, and penetrating inquirer after truth, and\r\ncarried a reverent mind and a sincerity of purpose into all his\r\ninvestigations. He affirmed that all our knowledge of the divine world\r\ncomes by spiritual intuition, and that all demonstrative systems tend to\r\nfatalism.\r\n\r\n  [By Tieck, 1809. In plaster.

Died at Mœglin, near Frankfort,\r\n  1828. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nEducated for the medical profession at Göttingen, where in 1774, he took\r\nhis doctor’s degree. From his youth upwards of a serious and reflective\r\nturn, engaged in philosophical studies, and in brooding over plans for\r\nthe amelioration of his kind. He passed some time in England, at the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, and there attracted the notice of George III., to\r\nwhom he was appointed Physician in Ordinary. After making a pedestrian\r\ntour through England, he visited Scotland, and closely investigated the\r\nsystem of agriculture there pursued. Henceforth he belonged to\r\nagricultural science. In 1794, he published his introduction to English\r\nagriculture. Retiring to Celle upon the death of his father, he founded\r\nin his native place an institution for the education of young\r\nagriculturists. Implements instantly improved, and a rational system of\r\ncultivation spread throughout the Communes bordering on that of Celle.\r\nInvited to Berlin, he quitted Hanover in 1804. Obtaining a property at\r\nMœglin on the Oder, through the generosity of the King of Prussia, he\r\nbegan a course of oral instruction in agriculture to classes of youth\r\ncollected from all parts of Germany. His Institution rapidly rose to the\r\nrank of an Academy, and all its Professors were paid by the Prussian\r\ngovernment. As an agricultural writer, the name of Thaer is worthy of\r\nbeing placed beside that of our own Arthur Young, and of the meritorious\r\nFrenchman, Olivier de Serres. He is the reformer of husbandry in his own\r\ncountry, and an enlightened expounder of the great principles upon which\r\nagricultural prosperity in modern times rests.\r\n\r\n  [By Carl Wichmann.

Aged 88.]\r\n\r\nHe began life under good auspices. His father, a porcelain painter, an\r\nupright and instructed man, in straitened circumstances, is said to have\r\nbeen assiduous in inculcating upon him his own principles of integrity.\r\nWhen, unable to support further the expenses of his education, he was\r\nabout putting him to a trade, the Meissen professors, struck by the\r\nlad’s talents, resolved to continue his education gratuitously, and\r\nafterwards obtained for him the same favour at Leipzig. He embarked in\r\nhis profession, and gained such distinction, that for a whole\r\ntwelvemonth, during the illness of the celebrated Wagner, all the\r\nhospitals of Dresden were placed under his direction. His eminence\r\noffered the fairest prospects, when he was visited by a growing distrust\r\nof the science which he practised. He found in it no settled and\r\ncommanding principles. He saw the ablest men, groping their way between\r\nexperience and conjecture. One law, as he thought, dawned on him; that\r\nthe cure of the disease is to be effected by the same agent which, in\r\nthe healthy body, would have produced it. On this basis he\r\nre-constructed medicine, giving to his new system the name of\r\n“Homœopathy,” or “The Science of Like Affections.” His disciples devoted\r\nthemselves to the creation of a suitable Materia Medica, by\r\nexperimenting upon their own healthy bodies; and it is a second\r\ndiscovery of Hahnemann, if a discovery, that infinitesimal doses may be\r\neffectual in the cure of disease. The system of Hahnemann waged war to\r\nthe knife, and it met with war to the knife. As an historical point it\r\nis worthy of remark, that Homœopathy has spread, and is spreading, its\r\nconquests. The honesty of the founder may stand on the single plain\r\nfact, that by denouncing and renouncing established doctrines, he\r\nstepped down from the safe height of his profession, into hazard of the\r\npoverty which he had tasted, and from which he had laboriously risen.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch.

HEINRICH WILHELM MATHIAS OLBERS. _Astronomer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Abergen, in Germany, 1758. Died at Bremen, in Germany, 1840.\r\n  Aged 82.]\r\n\r\nIn 1779, whilst studying medicine at Göttingen, he became known as an\r\nastronomer by his observations on the comet of that year. He then\r\ndiscovered a new method of calculating the orbits of comets. In 1802, he\r\ndiscovered the planet Pallas; and in 1807, after an arduous search of\r\nthree years, the planet Vesta. Olbers was by profession a physician, and\r\nhe divided his time between the practice of medicine, and the pursuit of\r\nhis darling study. His observatory was the most complete known in\r\nGermany at his time. He wrote but little, and his works are on abstruse\r\nsubjects. His valuable library was purchased at his death by the Emperor\r\nof Russia, and deposited in the University of Pultowa.\r\n\r\n  [For description of this statue, see Handbook to Modern Sculpture.]\r\n\r\n348. FRIEDRICH AUGUSTUS WOLF. _Philologist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Hainrode, in Germany, 1759. Died at Marseilles, 1824. Aged\r\n  65.]\r\n\r\nSon of the organist of Hainrode. In 1777, he entered the University of\r\nGöttingen, where he gave private lessons to his fellow-students in\r\nEnglish and Greek, and published an edition of Shakspeare’s Macbeth. In\r\n1807, he went to Berlin, and took an active part in the foundation of\r\nthe University shortly afterwards created there. Is honourably known to\r\nliterature, for his erudite and admirable editions of the classical\r\nauthors, and for his bold elucidation of many obscure points in ancient\r\nlearning. His most celebrated work, the “Prolegomena ad Homerum,”\r\npublished in 1795, was directed to overthrowing the opinion, previously\r\nuniversal, which saw in the “Iliad,” the entire creation of a single\r\nmind. He argues that it is the contexture of distinct traditionary\r\nsongs, the productions, probably, of many distinct singers: thus\r\ndissolving at once the unity of the poem and of the poet, and making out\r\nof one many Homers. An earlier suspicion had already separated the\r\nauthorship of the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey.” Both questions are still in\r\nfull debate amongst the learned. He may be regarded as the founder of\r\nthe modern philological school of Germany; and his “Prolegomena”\r\nundoubtedly exercised a greater influence upon modern scholarship than\r\nany work that has yet appeared.\r\n\r\n  [By F.

Aged 52.]\r\n\r\nHe was an humble private teacher in Leipzig when he first made\r\nacquaintance with the writings of Kant, whose views he eagerly adopted\r\nand cherished. He subsequently (1792) introduced himself to Kant by a\r\nwork which he wrote in eight days, “A Critique upon every possible\r\nRevelation.” This publication procured for its author the Chair of\r\nPhilosophy at Jena, in 1793, which he was obliged to resign in\r\nconsequence of his heterodox religious principles. Finding an asylum in\r\nPrussia, he was appointed to the Philosophical Chair first at Erlangen,\r\nthen at Berlin. In 1813, he joined a corps of volunteers, and took part\r\nin the memorable campaign of that year, his wife accompanying him, and\r\nperforming many heroic and womanly services to the wounded. Husband and\r\nwife both took fever in the discharge of their duties, and died. It has\r\nbeen said of Fichte that he erected the temple which Kant declined to\r\nbuild. His great aim was to construct a science out of Consciousness,\r\nand to found upon it a system of morals. He endeavoured to establish the\r\nidentity of Being and Thought, and is therefore the great advocate of\r\nIdealism, which, however, he understood in a different sense from that\r\ntaught by Berkeley. According to his theory, the realization of the\r\nworld is the complete development of ourselves--which should tend to the\r\nbeautiful, the useful, and the good. His life and death were both\r\nhonourable to his nature. Before he died, he was doomed to see his\r\nsystem in a great measure superseded by that of Schelling.\r\n\r\n  [Bust by Ludwig Wichmann.

Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe mighty traveller of our own day. Filled with literature and science,\r\nas if he had spent one life in the library, the laboratory, and the\r\nobservatory, he performed the work of another in treading visited and\r\nunvisited plain, valley and mountain of the eastern and western\r\nhemisphere; uniting an ardour of spirit and a vigour of intellect rarely\r\nmated, and not often, singly matched. An author of books that have\r\nadvanced existing science, and the creator of new sciences. His\r\nwritings, conveying an account of his world-wide journeys and scientific\r\nexploits, and treating profoundly and originally of general physics,\r\nzoology, comparative anatomy, astronomy, mineralogy, magnetism, and\r\nbotany, are without parallel for richness of materials, and in respect\r\nof their value as manuals for all enlightened explorers of the marvels\r\nof nature. After a life of almost superhuman labour, and inconceivable\r\nresults, the grey-headed sage sums up the diligence of his lengthened\r\nyears, in a survey which registers, along every line of human inquiry,\r\nthe point of progress attained in the contemplation of the\r\nUniverse,--the first half of the teeming nineteenth century having\r\nelapsed. Who else could have achieved--who but he could have\r\nattempted--the Atlantean service? Who but the philosopher, to whom the\r\nwhole cycle of the physical sciences is familiar--who walks hand in\r\nhand, a friend and fellow-labourer, with their most distinguished\r\ninquirers? Who but the scholar, before whose eyes the lore of old time\r\nlies unrolled? Who but the workman whose strength toil cannot quell, and\r\nwhose fire age does not quench?--Spread his “Kosmos” before a young and\r\nardent intelligence, which has just then accomplished its regular\r\nliberal nurture, and say “Read and comprehend.” The comprehension\r\nexacted will, when acquitted, have added an education.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch.

GOTTFRIED HERMANN. _Philologist and Critic._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Leipzig, 1772. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThis distinguished scholar evinced, at a very early age, a taste for\r\nclassical literature, but was compelled by his father to study law at\r\nJena. Returning to his native city, he resolved to abandon the career of\r\njurisprudence for that of literature. In 1798, he became Professor of\r\nphilosophy. The foundation of his reputation was his fine work on Greek\r\nmetres, well known to English students. He translated “The Clouds” of\r\nAristophanes, and some tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles. His\r\nacademic dissertations are numerous, and his Latin poems are admirable\r\nspecimens of antique composition. Hermann has rendered invaluable\r\nservice to the cause of letters. Goethe said of him, that he was “a true\r\nSçavant, for he knew how to renew the old and to revive the dead.” Dr.\r\nParr placed him at the head of the great contemporary critics.\r\n\r\n  [By Ernst Rietschel.

FRIEDRICH WILHELM JOSEPH VON SCHELLING. _Metaphysician._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Leonberg, in Germany, 1775. Still living.]\r\n\r\nAt Leipzig, where he studied medicine and philosophy, became the pupil\r\nof Fichte. Afterwards filled Fichte’s vacant Chair at Jena, where he\r\nlectured with great success. Continued in Bavaria until 1842, when he\r\nwas invited by the King of Prussia to Berlin. Is still there, occupying\r\nas lecturer the philosophical Chair once held by Hegel. Is often styled\r\nthe German Plato. It has been suggested that he should rather be called\r\nthe German Plotinus. Schelling proclaims the incapacity of reason to\r\nsolve the problems of philosophy, and calls in the aid of a higher\r\nfaculty--“intellectual intuition.” He is the founder of a new school of\r\nscientific thinkers, called the _Nature Philosophers_, of whom Oken is\r\nthe most illustrious example. He treats Newton’s speculations upon light\r\nwith disdain, although they have led to many practical discoveries.\r\nSchelling’s views on light and philosophy, generally, will probably lead\r\nto little more than endless disputation. His works, nevertheless,\r\nindicate a vivid imagination conjoined with, subtle dialectics.\r\nColeridge, in his philosophical writings, has often adopted and adapted\r\nthe ideas of Schelling. In many respects, Schelling’s head and face\r\nresemble those of Socrates.\r\n\r\n  [By J. Halbig. Marble. 1852. The original is in the Royal Palace at\r\n  Munich.

Aged\r\n  69.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a village schoolmaster, and educated for the medical\r\nprofession. Cultivated with ardour the science of chemistry, which then\r\nscarcely drew the attention of the medical student. Appointed Professor\r\nof Chemical Pharmacy in the University of Stockholm, and retained the\r\nChair for the space of forty-two years. At home and abroad he attained\r\nto great honour and distinction. In Sweden he was made a noble, and he\r\ncould boast of connexion with eighty-eight scientific societies of\r\nEurope and America. His patient investigations helped largely to lay the\r\nfoundations of organic chemistry; and to him pre-eminently belongs the\r\nhonour of applying the great principles of inorganic chemistry. He\r\ninvented the use of symbols for chemical formulæ, an invaluable method\r\nof representing chemical changes; and was as distinguished for his\r\nresearches in analytical chemistry, as for his philosophical views of\r\nthe science. His personal appearance was that of a strong, healthy man,\r\nand gave no indication of his intellectual power. An early riser,\r\ndevoting all his mornings to his scientific labours, and his evenings to\r\nsocial relaxation. He was beloved in Stockholm.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Marble. 1822.]\r\n\r\n355. SULPITZ VON BOISSERÉE. _Architect and Archæologist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cologne, 1775. Still living.]\r\n\r\nA man to whom, as to his brother, Germany is indebted for one of its\r\nmost interesting and valued picture galleries. The two brothers, and a\r\nfriend named Bertram, in 1803, formed a resolution to collect the\r\nartistic antiquities of Germany, and for years all three pursued their\r\nobject with the utmost vigour, intelligence, and zeal. In 1814 “The\r\nBoisserée Collection” already reckoned 200 works of art, and was\r\narranged at Cologne. It was ultimately transferred to Stuttgart, on the\r\ninvitation of the King of Wurtemburg. Many valuable masterpieces of old\r\nmasters were thus brought to light. In 1827, the collection was ceded to\r\nLouis, King of Bavaria, for 120,000 dollars, and in 1836 conveyed to\r\nMunich, in which city Sulpitz and his brother established themselves. A\r\nwriter upon the “Architectural Monuments of the Lower Rhine,” and an\r\nindefatigable, as well as a successful, day labourer in the field of his\r\nearly and later discoveries.\r\n\r\n  [Bust.

Died 1853. Aged 71.]\r\n\r\nDirector in Berlin of the Government department of trade, commerce, and\r\nbuildings, and head of the Great Industrial Society of Prussia. In his\r\npublic service he endeavoured to advance the principles of Free-trade,\r\nand always acted upon the idea that the regulative intervention of\r\ngovernment in matters of commerce should be restricted to cases of\r\ngeneral danger. He established many useful institutions in connexion\r\nwith his department, and caused the issue of several works of\r\ninstruction for industrial schools and for artisans. He also introduced\r\ninto Prussia valuable improvements in manufactures, brought home by\r\nhimself from the United States, England, and France, into which\r\ncountries he had travelled. An active promoter of enlightened industry.\r\n\r\n  [By F. Tieck. 1847.

KARL GUSTAV CARUS. _Physician and Anatomist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Leipzig, 1790. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a painter. Intended for a dyer,--he devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of chemistry; but, widening his sphere, applied himself to\r\nmedicine, and, subsequently, to anatomy. In 1811, appointed to the Chair\r\nof Comparative Anatomy in Leipzig; and, in 1815, to the Directorship of\r\nClinical Midwifery, at the Medico-Surgical Academy of Dresden. Has\r\nacquired great reputation by his lectures on Psychology. Also a painter\r\nof considerable talent, and the author of numerous works on Medicine,\r\nand upon Art. His Letters on Landscape-painting are valuable to artists;\r\ntheir merit was recognised by Goethe. No less important is his book on\r\nthe “Proportions of the Human Body,”--just published. In him severe\r\nscience and beautiful art--a rare union--are happily combined.\r\n\r\n  [By Ernst Rietschel. Plaster. 1846. In the possession of the\r\n  sculptor.]\r\n\r\n358. KARL GUTZKOW. _Journalist and Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Berlin, 1811.

The dramas of Gutzkow have\r\nfared better than his polemical writings, some of his plays being very\r\npopular. He is a prolific author, and has cleverness and wit, which he\r\nbrings to the illustration of every topic of the day; but his vanity and\r\nconceit surpass his abilities, and perpetually mislead him.\r\n\r\n  [By Ernst Rietschel.

Served\r\nwith great honour in the campaign of Silesia, 1742; secured the victory\r\nof Hennesdorf by the eminent skill displayed in the retreat from\r\nBohemia. As lieutenant-general, made the campaign in Saxony, 1756, and\r\nwon further distinction in 1760 at Torgau. When 80 years old still eager\r\nfor action, and kept out of battle only by the kind interdict of the\r\nking. He died honoured by his sovereign, beloved by his inferiors, and\r\nworshipped with enthusiastic admiration by the great mass of the people.\r\nFrederic the Great was fond of proposing military problems to his\r\nofficers, asking them, in such or such an imaginary situation,--“What\r\nwould you do?” to which the other officers replied, as they best might.\r\nAll that he could ever get from old Ziethen was: “Sire, only let me see\r\nthe enemy coming, and I shall know well enough what to do with him.”--So\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\n360.

Taken prisoner by the Prussians, whom he\r\njoined, but expelled from this service for duelling and dissipation.\r\nRetired to the country, married, and, after fourteen years’ quiet,\r\nreturned to the army as Major of the very regiment which he had quitted\r\nas Captain. Then commenced a glorious military career, proudly\r\nterminating with his opportune appearance on the field of Waterloo. In\r\n1814, visited England with the allied sovereigns, and was\r\nenthusiastically received. A rough and fearless soldier, brave, honest,\r\nfree, beloved by his comrades, devoted to his country, and a bitter\r\nhater of his country’s foes. As a general, daring, reckless, and\r\nimpetuous, to the detriment of otherwise high military qualifications.\r\nIn temper he was vehement and irascible, and an ardent lover of\r\npleasure. His soldiers gave him the nickname of “Marshal Forwards.”\r\n\r\n  [Bust, by Rauch. 1816. Marble.

He fought under Blucher in the\r\nbattles of Eylau, Friedland, and Tilsit. In 1813, he three times saved\r\nBerlin from the advancing French army. He was in the great battle of\r\nLeipzig; and in 1815, he repulsed Vandamme and Grouchy on the heights of\r\nWavre. The marvellous rapidity with which he brought up his division to\r\nthe field of Waterloo won high commendation from the Duke of\r\nWellington. He had great taste in the Fine Arts, and a cultivated mind.\r\nHe composed some pieces of sacred music, which have been much admired.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Bronze. 1824.

Though rough and uncouth in his\r\nmanners, his honour was unimpeachable, his integrity without a flaw, and\r\nhis devotion to the interests of Prussia patriotic and enlightened. He\r\nwas Prussian Minister of Finance in 1804: but resigning in consequence\r\nof some differences with the King, he retired to his patrimony in\r\nNassau. Thence recalled after the peace of Tilsit, he resumed his\r\nfunctions, and commenced a series of great social, economical, and\r\nmaterial reforms, which led directly to the resuscitation of the\r\nPrussian monarchy, and to her present eminence. Napoleon, jealous of the\r\nuseful activity of this Minister, demanded and obtained his exile. In\r\n1813, the banished man proceeded to St. Petersburg, where his counsels\r\ndirected the Emperor Alexander through the crisis of that dreadful year.\r\nNor did Prussian interests suffer, in consequence of the sagacious\r\nadvice that came from time to time to Berlin from the exile’s retreat in\r\nCourland.\r\n\r\n363.

He served first in the\r\nHanoverian service, then in the army of the King of England, and finally\r\nin that of Prussia. In the war with France, in 1806, he contributed\r\ngreatly to the brilliant retreat on Lübeck, effected by Blucher. After\r\nthe peace of Tilsit, he was named President of the Commission for the\r\nre-organization of the Prussian army, and his energy and wisdom enabled\r\nPrussia to bring a finely appointed army of 200,000 men into the field,\r\nafter Napoleon’s Russian reverses. He was wounded at Lutzen, and died at\r\nPrague shortly afterwards. In 1804, he had been appointed by the King of\r\nPrussia, conjointly with Baron Knesebeck, instructor to the Prince\r\nRoyal: and at one time of his life he wrote several works on military\r\nsubjects, which gained him great repute.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch.

He fought\r\nunder the British flag in the American revolution. When commanding\r\nsubsequently in the Prussian service, he concluded in 1812, on his own\r\nresponsibility, the celebrated Convention which separated the Prussian\r\ntroops from the French, and proved one of the main causes of Napoleon’s\r\noverthrow. He gained many victories at various times, and was honoured\r\nwith the title of Wartenburg for the battle fought at that place. In\r\n1821, he was created Field-Marshal. A brave man, endowed with great\r\nmilitary talent; a shrewd observer of men, ambitions, violent, yet\r\ndevoted to his country.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Bronze. 1818.

Commanded a brigade in the Prussian\r\ncontingent to Napoleon’s disastrous expedition to Russia, and bore an\r\nhonourable part in the wars subsequently undertaken against Napoleon.\r\nAccompanied Frederic William of Prussia on his visit to England. He died\r\non the same day as Buonaparte. All the sovereigns of the coalition had\r\nconferred honours upon him, and Napoleon himself decorated him with the\r\ncross of the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Bronze. 1819.

On\r\nthe return of Napoleon from Elba, he was placed at the head of Blucher’s\r\nstaff, and was mainly instrumental in bringing up the Prussian troops at\r\nWaterloo, where he ably conducted the pursuit. In 1831, took the command\r\nof the Prussian army on the breaking out of the Polish insurrection, and\r\ndied of cholera the same year. A great master of strategy.\r\n\r\n  [By F. Tieck.

Died near Berlin, 1835. Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nIn William Von Humboldt the highest qualities of a scholar were united\r\nto the talents of a statesman and man of the world. He discharged the\r\nfunctions of Ambassador at Vienna and in London, and served his country\r\non more than one grave and diplomatic mission. He was extensively\r\nlearned in languages dead and living; but that is common in Germany. His\r\n_originality_, as a philologist, lies in a delicacy of abstruse\r\nthought--a philosophical vein, as fine as profound, which he brings to\r\nbear on all questions of the literary field, from the rigid\r\ninvestigation of grammatical forms and laws, to the most feeling and\r\ncomprehensive criticisms of taste. A rare power of sifting analysis, a\r\nstrong impulse to tread, alone and self-guided, unfrequented grounds,\r\nand an eye to seek out new truth on ground the most trodden, may be read\r\nin his various masterly writings. He was a poet also.\r\n\r\n  [Modelled by Thorwaldsen, at Rome, in 1807.

HERMANN VON BOYEN. _Prussian Minister of War._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Kreutzburg, in Prussia, 1771.]\r\n\r\nCommenced his military career as corporal in an infantry regiment, 1784,\r\nand gradually rose until, in 1799, appointed Staff-Captain. In his youth\r\na great student of the works of Frederic the Great; and from 1794 to\r\n1796, during the war with Poland, the adjutant and friend of the\r\ncelebrated General Von Günther, whose military disciple he became, and\r\nwhose memoirs he subsequently composed. In his twenty-eighth year he\r\nwrote a treatise upon military law, which eminently conduced to the more\r\nhumane treatment and greater comfort of the common soldier. Served in\r\nall the later wars against Napoleon. Major-general at the Peace of\r\nParis, when he became Minister of War. In that capacity, established in\r\nconnexion with the service a number of organic laws, which display great\r\npractical wisdom, and a manly consideration for the well-being of the\r\narmy. Retired from office in 1819, and occupied himself in literary\r\npursuits. Reinstated by the present King of Prussia in 1841, he at once\r\npursued his former energetic course of improvement on behalf of his\r\ncountry and of its loyal defenders, to the great joy of the soldiers,\r\nand with the honour, good-will, and affection of the people.\r\n\r\n  [By Hopfgarten.

In 1841, appointed Chief Counsellor\r\nof State and Director of the Home Department in the government of\r\nKönigsberg. When, in 1847, the first united Prussian Chamber met,\r\nManteuffel powerfully defended the existing system against the liberal\r\nattempts of the day; and in April, 1848, protested and voted against\r\nuniversal suffrage. In November, 1848, appointed chief Administrator for\r\nBrandenburg, since which time his ministerial activity has become matter\r\nof Prussian history. Manteuffel took an active part in framing the\r\nconstitution of December 5, 1848. After the death of Count Brandenburg,\r\nhe was entrusted provisionally with the direction of foreign affairs;\r\nand in 1850 was elected President of State.

In 1809,\r\ndistinguished himself at Agram, and in the battles of 1813, 1814, and\r\n1815, won fresh laurels. In 1822, appointed Commander-General of the\r\nLombardo-Venetian kingdom. His last great service for Austria was after\r\nthe Revolution of 1848, when he opposed and defeated the vacillating\r\nattempts made by Charles Albert of Sardinia, on behalf of Italian\r\nliberty. When it is said that Radetzky is a brave soldier, an able\r\ngeneral, a loyal subject, and, as many aver, a courteous gentleman, his\r\nclaims to respect are enumerated. He is rigid and severe, if not cruel,\r\nas he is certainly regardless of all human considerations that presume\r\nto interpose between him and the duty which he owes as a soldier to his\r\nking.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch.

Aged 63.]\r\n\r\nThe Lion of the Reformation. One of the men who, by coming to their\r\ntime, have made an epoch in the world’s history. Assuredly the abuses of\r\nRome,--in her second supremacy, as the spiritual mistress of the\r\nworld,--must have aroused their effectual remedy; for partial\r\nresistances, before Luther rose, showed how deeply the mind of mankind\r\nresented and resisted the oppression and the spiritual malversation, and\r\nhow fast the time was ripening for general revolt. Europe, since the\r\noverthrow of the Roman Empire, had been gradually rising with the inward\r\nvigour of her renewed life. The restored study of classical letters came\r\nas a powerful external impulse. Rome had but slowly established her\r\ndomination, and only then securely given herself up to licence. Thus the\r\nstrengthening of the evil on the one hand, and of the resisting life on\r\nthe other, met: and then Luther came. He was fit for his Herculean\r\nlabour. He had stepped from the very heart of the people, and his strong\r\nnature bespoke his hardy origin. He was fearless as one who could not\r\nfeel fear in the midst of the most terrible danger; he was zealous as\r\none who labours under the sense of Divine appointment, who knows that to\r\ndie may be to live, to live may be to suffer worse than death: and who\r\nrejoices equally at every turn of fortune. He was threatened with the\r\nstake: he persisted in his crusade all the more for the menace. The Pope\r\nexcommunicated him in the face of all the world. He denounced the Pope\r\nbefore as large an audience. The Pope publicly burned all his writings:\r\nhe publicly burned the Bull of excommunication, the Canon Law, and the\r\nPope’s Decretals. Before Luther died,--and he fell asleep tranquilly,\r\nworn out with labour, not with age,--his doctrines had already taken\r\ndeep root in the wide world.

PHILIP MELANCTHON. _German Divine and Reformer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bretten, in the Palatinate of the Rhine, 1497. Died at Wurms,\r\n  in Germany, 1560. Aged 63.]\r\n\r\nThe wise and gentle sharer with Martin Luther in the glory of the\r\nReformation. Melancthon was Professor of Greek in the University of\r\nWittemberg in 1518, when Luther was there teaching Theology. They united\r\ntheir great gifts and powers to do the perilous labour of their lives,\r\nand each proceeded to his mission in the spirit created within him for\r\nthe accomplishment of a seemingly superhuman task. Luther raged\r\nfuriously against the error he encountered on his path. Melancthon\r\nstrove to entice it into the right road by gentle words and mild\r\nremonstrance. The one exhibited the resolute bearing of a soldier\r\nfighting for the church militant; upon the face of the other beamed the\r\nquiet heroism of the Christian saint. Luther upbraided his\r\ncompanion-in-arms for his lukewarmness. Melancthon met the rebuke by\r\ncontinuing his steadfast course of conciliation, caution, and thoughtful\r\nzeal. Luther found no friend in the camp of the enemy. The most\r\nintolerant of his foes respected the mild virtues of Melancthon. Both\r\nwere fit instruments for the hour in which they were summoned to action,\r\nand for the sacred cause they arose to defend: and, as was fitting, both\r\nwere buried side by side in death, as they had laboured side by side,\r\nand hand to hand, in life. Melancthon compiled the celebrated Augsburg\r\nConfession. He was a great scholar, attached to the study of\r\nmathematics, and to scientific studies generally. He had no desire for\r\nworldly honours and distinctions. He was a true hero.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by G. Schadow. Placed in the Walhalla by order of\r\n  King Louis.]\r\n\r\n373. FRIEDRICH ERNEST DANIEL SCHLEIERMACHER. _Theologian._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Breslau, in Prussia, 1768. Died at Berlin, 1834. Aged 66.]\r\n\r\nHis parents were of the Moravian brotherhood, which he quitted at the\r\nage of 18, and began to study philology and divinity at the University\r\nof Halle. In 1802, he taught the same subjects in the same University of\r\nHalle. In 1833, he visited England, and opened the German chapel of the\r\nSavoy. The author of several works distinguished for profound thought,\r\nconveyed perspicuously to those he is addressing. He was an excellent\r\ntheologian, a distinguished philologist, a profound critic, and an\r\nadmirable translator. His translation of Plato, unfortunately not\r\ncompleted, is the best extant. He had a pure and pious mind.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Marble. 1822.

FREDERIC WILLIAM. _Elector of Brandenburg._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cologne, 1620. Died 1688. Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nSurnamed the Great Elector, and father of the first King of Prussia. He\r\nsucceeded to the government in 1640, and found his dominions exhausted\r\nby war and mismanagement. He restored the public finances, and corrected\r\nabuses. In 1655, he joined the Swedes in the invasion of Poland. In\r\n1678, he completed the conquest of Pomerania. He then fought against the\r\nSwedes, and involved himself in war with France, because, after the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes, he had befriended 20,000 French\r\nProtestants who sought protection at his door. In 1686, he helped the\r\nEmperor against the Turks, and two years afterwards assisted William of\r\nOrange in his invasion of England. He left his territory as rich,\r\nfruitful, and well-governed, as he had found it poor and distracted. He\r\nhas been censured for his frequent change of party, but he deserves his\r\nname of “Great,” no less for the victories he won abroad, than for the\r\ngood services performed at home. He is described as a generous,\r\nkind-hearted man.\r\n\r\n  [By Ludwig Wichmann. Bronze. At Treptow.]\r\n\r\n375. FREDERIC WILLIAM I. _King of Prussia._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Berlin, 1688. Died there, 1740. Aged 52.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Frederic I. and the father of Frederic the Great. The best\r\nthat can be said of him is, that he left behind him a full treasury and\r\nan efficient army of 66,000 men. He was rough and rude in his manners, a\r\nhater of luxury, and parsimonious in all things but his expenditure for\r\nthe increase of his military resources. He had a childish desire to fill\r\nall his regiments with very tall men, and was unscrupulous in his\r\nmethods of gratifying the whim. An amusing story is told in connexion\r\nwith this passion. Meeting with a fine, tall, and strong young peasant\r\nwoman, who was on errand to the quarters of a regiment, he gave her a\r\nletter to deliver to the commanding officer, ordering him to marry the\r\nbearer to his tallest grenadier. The girl, hindered on her way, and not\r\nknowing the purport of her mission, entrusted it to a little old woman,\r\nand the marriage was effected accordingly. His contempt for science and\r\nliterature was supreme, and he made no secret of his want of all respect\r\nfor their professors. He was feared, not loved, in his country, and his\r\ndeath caused no regret.\r\n\r\n  [By Hopfgarten. Bronze. At Treptow. Done within the last ten years.]\r\n\r\n376. FREDERIC II., SURNAMED THE GREAT. _King of Prussia._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Berlin, 1712. Died 1786. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest soldier of his time, and the most famous king that Prussia\r\nhas given to her throne. At the commencement of his reign, in 1740, his\r\ndominions contained two and a quarter millions of inhabitants. At the\r\nend of its 46 years, Prussia counted six millions of subjects. He held\r\nthe field singly against Russia, Saxony, Sweden, France, and Austria;\r\nand came with honour and rich booty out of the conflict. A great worker,\r\nwhether in the field or in the cabinet. His custom was to rise at five\r\nin the morning to read “papers.” These he dispatched with a word or two,\r\nwritten on the margin: the rest of the day was marked out with exact\r\nprecision, a part of it being invariably devoted to literary pursuits,\r\nand to the cultivation of music, of which he was fond. No man ever gave\r\nless of his time to frivolity or inaction. His dress was plain, and\r\nnever other than military; his toilet, when he rose, occupied him only a\r\nfew minutes; he always wore high jack boots, and he never changed his\r\ndress during the day. An able administrator, a liberal encourager of\r\nart, science, and industry, and the personal friend of D’Alembert,\r\nCondorcet, and Voltaire, with all of whom he personally corresponded.\r\nHis conversation was lively and brilliant, not unfrequently sarcastic:\r\nbut, in action, he was not cruel. A free thinker, rejoicing in his\r\nintellectual independence. Besides his other acquisitions, he was one of\r\nthe guilty sharers in the dismemberment of Poland. Nevertheless, dying,\r\nhe left an illustrious name to his country, and a throne to his\r\nsuccessor worthy the acceptance of a European monarch.\r\n\r\n  [For an account of the admirable and unique monument, by Rauch, of\r\n  which this is the life-size model, see No. 195 in Handbook to Modern\r\n  Sculpture.]\r\n\r\n377. FREDERIC LOUIS HENRY. _Prince of Prussia._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Berlin, 1726. Died at Rheinsberg, in Prussia, 1802. Aged 76.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Frederic William I., of Prussia, and brother of Frederic the\r\nGreat. A student in his youth, and a distinguished soldier in his\r\nmanhood. He held important command during the Seven Years’ War. In later\r\nlife, when he withdrew into retirement, he erected in his garden a\r\nmonument on a huge mound of earth. It was raised in memory of his\r\ncompanions in arms, and underneath, it, in a vault, he directed that\r\nhis own remains should be interred.\r\n\r\n  [By Emil Wolff. Marble. 1847. It was modelled at Rome. The original is\r\n  in the Palace at Berlin.]\r\n\r\n378. MAXIMILIAN JOSEPH I. _King of Bavaria._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1756. Died 1825. Aged 69.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1799, Elector, and from 1806, King of Bavaria. The year that he saw\r\nhis Duchy raised to the dignity of a kingdom, Maximilian, who for some\r\nyears was the faithful ally of Napoleon, gave his daughter in marriage\r\nto Eugène Beauharnois. In 1813, the Bavarian king, acting in the true\r\ninterests of his country and of humanity, joined the allies against\r\nFrance, and helped with them to rescue Germany from the fangs of the\r\nFrench invader. In public as well as private life, Maximilian was\r\ncourteous, benevolent, simple-minded, and true-hearted.\r\n\r\n  [By Stiglmayer. In marble. It is in the Palace at Munich. Stiglmayer\r\n  was for a long time at the head of the Royal Foundry for bronze\r\n  casting.]\r\n\r\n379. FREDERIC WILLIAM III. _King of Prussia._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1770. Died 1840, aged 70.]\r\n\r\nThe grand nephew of Frederic the Great. He succeeded to the throne in\r\n1797, and, in 1806, was involved in a war with France, which, before its\r\nclose, almost extinguished his kingdom. The peace of Tilsit, in 1807,\r\nleft him little more than a nominal sovereignty. In 1810, he founded the\r\nUniversity of Berlin; in 1812, took part with France against Russia; and\r\nin 1813, again declared war against France. His army shared in the\r\ntriumphal entry into Paris in 1814; and in 1815, his soldiers under\r\nBlucher partook of the glory of Waterloo at the crisis of the battle. A\r\nman of domestic virtues, but of small capacity. Napoleon’s judgment of\r\nthis King was somewhat harsh. “He is,” said Buonaparte, “the greatest\r\nidiot on the face of the earth--without intelligence, and incapable of\r\nsustaining a conversation for the space of five minutes--a true Don\r\nQuixote.” The present King of Prussia is the son of Frederic William\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Marble. 1826. In the Royal Palace at Berlin.]\r\n\r\n380. LOUIS FERDINAND. _Prince of Prussia._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1772. Died at Saalfeld, in Germany, 1806. Aged 34.]\r\n\r\nA soldier of great distinction, and beloved by the Prussian army. In the\r\nwar of 1806, he commanded the advanced guard of Prince Hohenlohe, and\r\nwas killed in that year, whilst covering the evacuation of Saalfeld, in\r\nCentral Germany. He died bravely. He was of a generous and vehement\r\nnature, a great advocate of the war, and frequently a violent opponent\r\nof the government. He was impatient of the fact, that the accident of\r\nhis birth prevented the full exercise of energy and activity, which\r\nmeaner men were permitted.\r\n\r\n  [By L. Wichmann. Bronze. 1822. At Potsdam.]\r\n\r\n381. LOUISA AUGUSTA WILHELMINA AMELIA. _Queen of Prussia._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Hanover, 1776. Died at Hohenzieritz, 1810. Aged 34.]\r\n\r\nThe honoured wife of Frederic William III. of Prussia. Napoleon admired\r\nher for her wit, tact, and singular address, and Europe applauded her\r\nfor her heroic character, and true nobility of soul. On the breaking out\r\nof the war with France, in 1806, she was inspired with enthusiasm, and\r\nwas frequently seen in the streets of Berlin at the head of her\r\nHussars, whose uniform she wore. On the defeat of her husband at\r\nAuerstadt, she shared his perilous retreat, and evinced great firmness\r\nand resignation. She was also with her husband at the Conference of\r\nTilsit, and was earnest in her entreaties to Napoleon for easier\r\nconditions on behalf of her unfortunate country. She was beautiful in\r\nperson, calm and constant in reverses, with great dignity and grace of\r\nmanner. She was beloved by her people.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Marble. 1824.]\r\n\r\n382. LUDWIG I. _Ex-King of Bavaria._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1786. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe eldest son and successor of King Maximilian Joseph. As Crown Prince\r\nhe took little interest in public affairs, but confined himself to the\r\nzealous patronage of the fine arts. Frugal in his personal expenditure,\r\nhe was extravagant in his purchases of works of art, and in the\r\nconstruction of his celebrated Glyptothek, a building devoted to the\r\nreception of the finest works of sculpture. Ascending the throne in\r\n1825, he commenced many economical reforms, but still drew around him,\r\nby his munificent patronage, the most celebrated artists of Germany, for\r\nthe adornment and elevation of his capital. More than one stately\r\nedifice and exquisite collection in Munich bear testimony to his love\r\nfor art and zeal in its promotion. He would have done still more for his\r\ncity had he been permitted. He lodged the munificent sum of £30,000 in\r\nthe hands of an English banker to purchase the Elgin marbles, in the\r\nevent of their rejection by the English government. The sum actually\r\npaid for the marbles by England was £35,000. A grandeur is reflected\r\nupon this--the finest side of Ludwig’s character. On the other hand, he\r\nhas lived to become a bigot, to forget his early political reforms, to\r\ndeal with a rough hand in matters of religion and state, and to shock\r\npublic opinion by illicit alliances, at the very moment he is expressing\r\na pious anxiety for the restoration of monasteries. In 1848, Ludwig I.\r\nabdicated in favour of his son Maximilian, the reigning king. The\r\nex-king is a ruler fit for the middle ages, when the love of art was\r\nintense and passionate, when manners were rude and unformed, and the\r\npeople in fetters, spiritual and bodily.\r\n\r\n  [By Halbig, 1848.]\r\n\r\n382A.

LEOPOLD I. _King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1790. Still living.]\r\n\r\nHead of the House of Coburg. He was educated in Germany, and in 1816,\r\nmarried Charlotte, the daughter of George IV. of England. She died the\r\nfollowing year. In 1832, he married a daughter of Louis Philippe of\r\nFrance; and in 1850, she also died. He was called to the sovereignty of\r\nBelgium in 1832. Although a foreign prince, and a Protestant ruling over\r\na Catholic country, he has succeeded in winning the respect of all\r\npolitical parties, and the sympathies of all religious sects. He is the\r\ntype of a constitutional king on the continent of Europe, and his\r\npersonal influence, in European politics, is considered to be weightier\r\nthan in proportion to the size of his dominions. He is the uncle of\r\nQueen Victoria.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by G. Geefs, in Windsor Castle.]\r\n\r\n383.* LOUISE MARIE. _Queen of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n  [Died 1850.]\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of Louis Philippe, King of the French, and second\r\nwife of King Leopold I. of Belgium.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by G. Geefs, in Windsor Castle.]\r\n\r\n384. FREDERIC WILLIAM IV. _Reigning King of Prussia._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1795. Still living.]\r\n\r\nA king whose good intentions and fair-sounding promises seem invariably\r\nto overbalance his powers of performance. Anxious for popularity, yet\r\nalways vacillating on the path that leads to it. Manifestly ambitious,\r\nbut kept aloof from the great prizes of ambition by want of moral\r\ncourage, of earnestness, and vigorous action. He commenced his reign\r\nwith many advantages, and might have rendered himself the most powerful\r\nsovereign of Germany, and the most popular of its rulers. He has missed\r\nthe power, and parted with the popularity. He promised his people a\r\nconstitution: they have never received it. In the Revolution of 1848 he\r\nsided with the extreme liberals, but only to bound back again--further\r\nthan ever--into the arms of absolutism. In his conduct towards Russia\r\nand England in the momentous dispute of 1854, Frederic William IV. is\r\nfaithful to his character and his antecedents.\r\n\r\n  [By Rauch. Marble. 1845. In the Royal Palace at Berlin.]\r\n\r\n385. NICHOLAS PAULOVITCH. _Reigning Emperor of all the Russias._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1896. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe third son of Paul I. and of Maria Feodorowna, and the eighth\r\nsovereign of the Holstein-Gottorp dynasty, which is of German origin.\r\nSucceeded to the throne in 1825, upon the death of Alexander--his elder\r\nbrother Constantine renouncing the throne in his favour. In 1826,\r\ndeclared war against Persia; in 1828, the war closed in his favour. In\r\nthe same year found occasion for a quarrel with the Turks, crossed the\r\nBalkan mountains, which Russian troops had never before passed, and\r\nimposed hard conditions upon the Sultan--amongst others, the so-called\r\nProtectorate of the Danubian Principalities. The insurrection in Poland,\r\nafter the French Revolution of 1830, the commencement of the war in the\r\nCaucasus, are familiar events. Still more recent is the interference of\r\nNicholas in the war between Hungary and Austria--an interference that\r\nrestored Hungary to Austrian rule--and, later still, the invasion of the\r\nDanubian principalities, on the plea of securing the rights of the Greek\r\nChurch in the Turkish dominions. A fanatic in his adherence to Russian\r\ncustoms, language, and religion, and glorying in his title of Spiritual\r\nChief of the Orthodox Church. The incarnation of despotism, and the\r\nstern hater of all liberal ideas. His rule military and absolute. Like\r\nFrederic the Great, he never shows himself but in military costume. Is\r\nof great height, and said to be very proud of his size. His life one of\r\nfeverish activity. He gets through more work in a day than other\r\nmonarchs can manage in a month. He rides, walks, holds a review,\r\nsuperintends a sham fight, goes on the water, exercises the navy, gives\r\na fête, takes his meals, and enjoys his rest, all within the twenty-four\r\nhours. He is a wondrous traveller--travelling faster and getting over\r\nmore ground than everybody else--and has an absolute passion for\r\nmilitary evolutions. Since the days of the Empress Catharine,\r\nConstantinople--called in Russia Czarapol (city of the Czars)--has been\r\nregarded as the future capital of the Russian empire. Nicholas, after\r\nmuch diplomacy, cozening, double-dealing, menace, and display of anger,\r\nhas put forth his massive hand to seize it. The world waits to see\r\nwhether that greedy hand shall grasp its prize, or recoil smitten and\r\nmaimed for its unauthorized rapacity.\r\n\r\n  [By C. Rauch. Marble. 1820.

At the time of his accession, Vienna had just been\r\nrecovered from the insurgents, but Hungary was in arms against Austria.\r\nIn 1849, a new constitution, of a more liberal character, was\r\npromulgated by the Emperor, and, in the same year, Hungary was reduced\r\nto submission by the assistance of Russia. In 1850, the young Emperor\r\nreturned to the old system of absolute government. In 1852, his life was\r\nattempted by a Hungarian whilst walking on the ramparts of Vienna.\r\nFrancis Joseph is personally popular. He is bold and soldier-like,\r\npossessed of strong will and independent judgment. His experience is\r\nbeyond his years.\r\n\r\n  [By Halbig. Marble. 1850.

The British\r\nMuseum contains 20 antique portrait busts; those of Homer, Pericles,\r\nDiogenes, and Julius Cæsar have a good claim to authenticity. There are,\r\nalso, in the Museum, some valuable antique Portrait Statues. The English\r\nportraits, in Sculpture, in the Crystal Palace have been collected, as\r\ntime permitted, from old busts and statues, and from the studios of\r\nliving and deceased sculptors. Attached to the lives of our English\r\nworthies given in the following pages, will be found, wherever\r\npracticable, the names of the respective artists.\r\n\r\nWith the English Contingent, the muster of our illustrious army for the\r\npresent closes. Five hundred busts and statues constitute the vigorous\r\ngerm of a collection which it is hoped eventually to render by its\r\nextent worthy of the magnificent structure in which it is housed, and of\r\nthe subject which it is intended to vivify, viz.:--The history of the\r\ngreat men of all nations who have, by thought and deed, advanced human\r\ncivilization, and stamped their impress, whether for good or evil, upon\r\nthe world through which they have passed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  (_The English Portraits commence immediately behind the Farnese\r\n  Hercules at the north-west angle of the Great Transept and Nave._)\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISTS AND MUSICIANS.\r\n\r\n388. INIGO JONES. _Architect._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1572. Died 1651. Aged 79.]\r\n\r\nInigo Jones served his apprenticeship to a joiner: but his talent for\r\nlandscape-drawing obtained for him the favour of the Earl of Pembroke,\r\nin whose company he visited France, Flanders, Germany, and Italy. At\r\nVenice he was inspired with a taste for architecture, and following the\r\nart with ardour and success obtained the office of first architect to\r\nthe King of Denmark. The king took Jones to England in 1606, and\r\nintroduced him to James I. His employment at the English Court as scenic\r\ndecorator is well known. The attachment of Inigo Jones, who was a Roman\r\nCatholic, to the cause of Charles I., caused him great loss and\r\nsuffering during the civil wars, and he died, shortly after the\r\nsacrifice of his master, worn out with grief and trouble. The style of\r\narchitecture introduced into England by this famous master, was founded\r\non the Venetian school, and more particularly on that branch of it\r\nexercised by Andrea Palladio. It is distinguished by excellent\r\nproportions, and by a masculine and noble character, which, whilst it\r\ndoes not condescend to borrow too much from ornament, yet makes just use\r\nof its charm. The Banquetting House at Whitehall, the only completed\r\nportion of the magnificent palace designed by Jones, is his\r\n_chef-d’œuvre_, and bears comparison with any work of the Italian style\r\nin Europe. He practised the best and purest style of Italian\r\narchitecture ever known in England.\r\n\r\n389. SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN. _Architect and Mathematician._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Wiltshire, 1632. Died at Hampton Court, 1723. Aged 91.]\r\n\r\nWe think of Wren as the first of British architects; but he was\r\nsomething more. As a mathematician, he was in his day second only to\r\nNewton; and in general scientific knowledge, he had no superior.\r\nEducated at Westminster. At thirteen, had already invented a new\r\nastronomical instrument. At fourteen, entered Wadham College,\r\nOxford;--and, young as he was, formed one of the original members of a\r\nclub established for philosophical discussions and experiments; a club\r\nout of which sprang the Royal Society. When twenty-five, Professor of\r\nAstronomy at Gresham College, London. At the Restoration, Savilian\r\nProfessor of Astronomy at Oxford; his skill as an architect having been\r\nmeanwhile shown in the Sheldon Theatre at Oxford. The popular fame of\r\nWren rests on St. Paul’s Cathedral, which he began to rebuild nine years\r\nafter the great fire, taking thirty-five years to complete his\r\nmagnificent labour. Before, and during this lengthened period, he built\r\nother edifices, and applied his vigorous and subtle mind to the most\r\nabstruse branches of science. His mechanical discoveries are numerous.\r\nHe invented an instrument for ascertaining the amount of rain falling in\r\neach year; he rendered the taking of astronomical observations more easy\r\nand exact; he was the originator of the attempt to introduce fluids into\r\nthe veins of animals; and there is every reason to believe that to him,\r\nand not to Prince Rupert, we owe the art of mezzotint engraving. Amongst\r\nhis architectural buildings are Trinity College Library, Cambridge, the\r\nnew part of Hampton Court Palace, Chelsea Hospital, a wing of Greenwich\r\nHospital, and the palace at Winchester. St. Paul’s, probably suggested\r\nby St. Peter’s at Rome, although not of equal dimensions with its\r\nsupposed prototype, is a far nobler work of art, excelling it in plan,\r\nin composition externally, in variety of effect internally, and in\r\nscientific construction. Bow Church, Cheapside, St. Stephen’s, Walbrook,\r\nand most of the other churches, in the City of London--where he chiefly\r\nworked--with their exquisite and varied steeples, are the work of Wren,\r\nwhose ecclesiastical edifices greatly surpass in beauty all his other\r\nbuildings. In his time the Greek style had not been made known, and\r\nthough with the Roman acquainted only through books, and the Renaissance\r\nbuildings of Paris, his work in it is critically correct. His native\r\ngenius is stamped upon his buildings, and he is ever to be admired, if\r\nnot always imitated. Supplanted by Court intrigue in 1718, he spent his\r\nold age as quietly as intrigue would let him at Hampton Court, absorbed,\r\nand finding compensation, in his scientific studies, and visiting London\r\noccasionally to see how the repairs at Westminster Abbey were going on.\r\n\r\n390. DAVID GARRICK. _Player and Dramatist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Hereford, 1716. Died at Hampton, 1779.

He adopted the stage, and after playing for some\r\ntime at Ipswich under the assumed name of Lyddel, made his first\r\nappearance in London, in 1741, in the theatre of Goodman’s-fields. He\r\nwas twenty-five years old--the part was Richard III.--the success\r\ntriumphant. According to tradition, the sole imperfect reporter to\r\nposterity of the triumphs achieved on the scenic boards, Garrick was a\r\nrare master of his art; equally impressive in tragedy and comedy. Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds painted him smiling at Comedy, looking sadly at\r\nTragedy,--and claimed by both. He raised immeasurably the character of\r\nthe actor’s profession in this country, and purified the stage. His\r\nacting was founded upon a delicate and thorough perception of Truth and\r\nNature. To him is due the great merit of restoring Shakspeare to the\r\nboards, and of annihilating the false taste created by the dramatists of\r\na later period. His last appearance on the stage was in 1776. He was\r\nsmall in stature, but well built; his eyes were dark, and full of fire.\r\nHe had marvellous power of transfusing the workings of the soul into the\r\nface, and all the passions were at his bidding. He was very vain, and\r\nnot without other weaknesses; but else a generous and worthy man. His\r\nprivate life reflected additional lustre on his genius, and as citizen\r\nand artist he earned the honourable grave which he found in Westminster\r\nAbbey. Garrick was also a writer for the stage. His comedies and farces\r\nare lively and agreeable, and some of his epigrams have wit and fancy.\r\nJohnson and he maintained their friendship to the last. The great\r\nlexicographer affected contempt for the profession of his pupil; but he\r\nhugged “Davy,” nevertheless, in the folds of his capacious heart, and\r\nwas justly proud of his achievements and renown.\r\n\r\n391. HENRY FUSELI or FUESSLI. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1745. Died 1825. Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nAn artist of undoubted genius and originality, but very eccentric both\r\nas painter and as man. Born at Zurich, where he cultivated learning with\r\ngreat ardour, especially the literature of England; at the same time\r\ntook delight in copying the works of Michael Angelo and Raffaelle. Came\r\nto England in 1763, and showed his paintings to Sir Joshua Reynolds, who\r\npraised the work and recommended to the young aspirant the usual\r\npilgrimage to Rome. Obeying the command he remained for eight years in\r\nthe city of Art, and then came back to England where he worked his way\r\nto honour. In 1790, he was Royal Academician; in 1799, Professor of\r\nPainting; in 1804, Keeper of the Royal Academy. Fuseli was a good\r\nscholar, endowed with a potent and wild imagination, and an excellent\r\nanatomist; but he suffered his imagination to lead him into\r\nextravagance, and his anatomy protruded itself in his pictures. He\r\npainted, in 1798, a series of forty-seven pictures illustrative of\r\nMilton. They reveal grand conception and daring power, but tremble\r\noccasionally on the verge of the grotesque. No later artist has ventured\r\nto follow him in his flights, but his profound interpretations of the\r\ntrue spirit of poetry may be contemplated by all men with advantage.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble, by E. H. Baily, R.A. Executed for Sir Thomas\r\n  Lawrence, 1824.]\r\n\r\n392. JAMES NORTHCOTE. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Plymouth, 1746. Died 1831. Aged 85.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a watchmaker, and intended for his father’s business; but, at\r\nan early age, he transferred his affections from the parental shop to\r\nthe more genial region of art. In 1771, he attracted the notice of\r\nReynolds, under whose eye he studied for a time, and in 1777, set out\r\nfor Italy. In 1783, first exhibited at the Royal Academy. In 1787,\r\nelected Royal Academician. The subjects of Northcote are chiefly\r\nhistorical, but he is not remarkable for power, or originality of\r\nconception. Although he displayed considerable skill in composition and\r\ncolouring, as well as some vigour of expression, his ability in art was\r\nby no means equal to his enthusiasm and his application. Northcote was\r\nalso a writer on art, and the author of a Life of Reynolds. At the age\r\nof eighty-four he published a Life of Titian. He was penurious and\r\neccentric, and not a favourite with his brother Academicians.\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A., 1821.]\r\n\r\n392A. JAMES NORTHCOTE. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Modelled from the life, and executed in marble, by Joseph Bonomi.\r\n  Presented by J. S. Scoles, Esq.]\r\n\r\n393. JOHN RAPHAEL SMITH. _Engraver._\r\n\r\n  [Born about 1750. Died in 1811.]\r\n\r\nA distinguished draughtsman in crayons, and a mezzotint engraver. The\r\nfriend of Chantrey the sculptor, when that admired artist was serving\r\nhis time at Sheffield, in the shop of Mr. Ramsay, carver and gilder. It\r\nis related that the sight of Mr. Smith’s drawings, together with his\r\nconversation, first rendered Chantrey impatient of his servitude in the\r\ncarver’s workshop, and induced him to purchase his release, which he\r\nobtained two years before his indentures had expired, for the sum of\r\nfifty pounds. This bust of John Raphael Smith, by Chantrey, was the\r\nfirst that brought the young sculptor into note. It was exhibited in the\r\nRoyal Academy when Chantrey was 24 years old, and, during the\r\ndisposition of the works for exhibition, attracted the attention of\r\nNollekens, who exclaimed, “This is a splendid work. Let the man be\r\nknown. Remove one of my busts and put this in its place.”\r\n\r\n  [The subject of this bust was afflicted with deafness, and the\r\n  expression of the infirmity is cleverly given in the face.]\r\n\r\n394. JOHN FLAXMAN. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at York, 1755. Died 1826. Aged 71.]\r\n\r\nBeyond all compare the greatest artist England has produced, and in all\r\nrespects one of her worthiest sons. His life constitutes one of the\r\nlandmarks set up in a nation for the guidance of the ambitious, and the\r\nencouragement of the desponding. His father was a moulder of plaster\r\ncasts: in whose humble shop the boy received his earliest inspiration.\r\nFeeble, and crippled, and thrown upon himself, he read such books as he\r\ncould obtain, and made drawings from the classic models that surrounded\r\nhim. This was his education, for there was no money at home to purchase\r\na better. At ten, the self-taught boy could read Latin, and had picked\r\nup much varied information. A shop filled with plaster casts will be\r\nvisited occasionally by men of taste and feeling. One such man saw, and\r\nwas struck by the genius of John Flaxman. His name was Mathew, and by\r\nhim the child, who could read Latin, was made acquainted with the\r\nbeauties of the Iliad and Odyssey. At fifteen, admitted a student of the\r\nRoyal Academy, and competed successfully for the silver medal. What was\r\nto be done next?--the father without means, and the youth old enough to\r\nearn his own bread! The young sculptor entered the service of the\r\nMessrs. Wedgwood, and devoted some dozen years of his life to the\r\nimprovement of their porcelain manufacture. His genius stamped upon the\r\nproducts of the potteries a character of beauty and classic elegance\r\nrivalling the productions of any country. The forms were admired in his\r\nown day; they are now more highly esteemed than ever. At the age of\r\ntwenty-seven Flaxman married Anne Denman. His marriage, his friends\r\ndeclared, would ruin him as an artist. Friends are apt to look upon the\r\nshadowy side of one’s happiness. In this case they were mistaken. Anne\r\nDenman had the finest qualities of heart; she possessed also exquisite\r\ntaste, and a cultivated mind. She appreciated the genius of her husband,\r\nand was an enthusiast for his works. She accompanied him to Italy, where\r\nhe nourished his talents by the study of the masterpieces of antiquity.\r\nAt Rome he executed his illustrations of Homer, Hesiod, Æschylus, and\r\nDante. For the first-named he received fifteen shillings for each\r\ndrawing, and was satisfied. He was elected member of the Academies of\r\nFlorence and Carrara, and after seven years’ absence came back to\r\nEngland. His reputation bad preceded him, and he soon justified his fame\r\nby his noble monument of Lord Mansfield, in Westminster Abbey. The works\r\nof Flaxman, whether of the pencil or the chisel, may take rank with the\r\nproductions of any age or country. They are distinguished by simplicity,\r\ndignity, sublimity, grace, and true poetic feeling. If any modern\r\nsculptor may take rank with the ancients, Flaxman’s place will be second\r\nto none. His productions are scattered over the globe; we meet them in\r\nIndia, the two Americas, and in Italy, as well as nearer home. He is\r\nbetter appreciated everywhere than in England. But we are beginning to\r\nknow his value. His worth as a man was equal to his greatness as an\r\nartist. All who knew him speak of his modesty, his gentleness, his\r\nsingle-heartedness. After the death of his wife in 1820, whom he\r\ntenderly loved, he lived in comparative retirement.\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A. From the marble executed for Sir Thomas\r\n  Lawrence, 1824.]\r\n\r\n395. THOMAS STOTHARD. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1755. Died 1834. Aged 79.]\r\n\r\nApprenticed at an early age to a pattern draughtsman. Subsequently, and\r\nfor many years, he furnished the illustrations to “The Novelist’s\r\nMagazine.” Became the reigning prince of illustrators, and for fifty\r\nyears continued to adorn the pages, not only of contemporary literature,\r\nbut of our poets from Chaucer all down to Rogers. His most famous\r\nproductions are the illustrations to “The Pilgrim’s Progress,” to\r\n“Robinson Crusoe,” to “Rogers’s Italy,” the Procession of the Flitch of\r\nBacon, the Pilgrimage to Canterbury, and the Wellington Shield. He made\r\nmany designs for sculptors; amongst others, that for Chantrey’s\r\n“Sleeping Children,” in Lichfield cathedral. At one time or another he\r\nattempted every branch of the limner’s art. He had great powers of\r\nimagination, moulded and directed by unflagging industry and the\r\nseverest application. His genius is peculiarly English. He studied\r\ndeeply the works of Raffaelle and Durer, but was no slavish imitator of\r\nthese, or of any other men. The grace that clings to his works is\r\nessentially the expression of his own mind. Let us see his productions\r\nhow, or when, or where we may, his spirit is detected at once, and we\r\nsay, “This is Stothard.” His female figures, not always strictly correct\r\nin drawing, are exquisitely graceful. His life passed evenly in the\r\nperformance of labour in which he delighted. He was a good man, and his\r\nworks are his annals.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble executed by E. H. Baily, R.A., in. 1825, for Sir\r\n  Thomas Lawrence.]\r\n\r\n396. SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bristol, 1769. Died 1830. Aged 61.]\r\n\r\nOf humble origin; the father of Sir Thomas being the landlord of the\r\n“Black Bear,” at Devizes, in Wiltshire. At an early age evinced great\r\ndelight in drawing, and a talent for the recitation of poetry. Received\r\nhis first instruction at Bath from Mr. Hoare, the painter in crayons;\r\nand when thirteen years old, gained from the Society of Arts the great\r\nsilver palette and five guineas, for a copy, in crayons, of the\r\n“Transfiguration.” When eighteen, he exhibited seven female portraits at\r\nSomerset House. In 1791, chosen Associate of the Royal Academy. In 1815,\r\nknighted; and in 1820, upon the death of West, elected President of the\r\nRoyal Academy. The first portrait painter of his time, and in other\r\nrespects an accomplished man. His numerous works are representations of\r\nthe most notable and wealthiest people of his day, by whom he was\r\ncourted, honoured, and richly rewarded. His colouring was clear and\r\nbrilliant, and his design most graceful; but vigour and truthfulness of\r\ncharacter are not always remarked in his productions. Lawrence had\r\nlittle or no education,--he was removed from school when only eight\r\nyears old,--but he must have picked up much on his road. One of our\r\ngreat actors has acknowledged his large debt of gratitude to Lawrence\r\nfor instruction, advice, and intellectual training.\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A. Taken the year after Sir Thomas Lawrence’s\r\n  death.]\r\n\r\n397. CHARLES KEMBLE. _Player._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Brecknock, 1775. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe living chief of a family remarkable for dramatic genius. Since the\r\ntime of Garrick, until very recently, the English stage has not been\r\nwithout its Kemble, as one of its brightest ornaments. Mrs. Siddons and\r\nJohn Kemble, were the sister and brother of Charles. As the\r\nrepresentative of Falconbridge, Mercutio, Benedick, Cassio, and similar\r\ncharacters, Charles Kemble has been without an equal in our time. He\r\nfirst appeared at Sheffield, as Orlando, in “As You Like it,” in 1792.\r\nHis first appearance in London was at Drury Lane Theatre (1794), in the\r\ncharacter of Malcolm, in “Macbeth.” He retired from the stage in 1836,\r\nbut subsequently returned to the boards for a short time, in 1840, in\r\norder to play a few of his best parts before her present Majesty. He\r\nplayed for the last time, April 10, 1840, in the character of Hamlet.\r\n\r\n  [By Dantan, 1842.]\r\n\r\n398. FRANCIS CHANTREY. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Norton, near Sheffield, 1781. Died in London, 1841. Aged 60.]\r\n\r\nThe first portrait sculptor of his day, but not equally famous for works\r\nof imagination, the very few compositions of this kind that proceeded\r\nfrom his chisel having been suggested to him by other more poetic minds.\r\nChantrey did not command astonishment, but compelled admiration by the\r\nsimplicity, beauty, and truth, that were stamped on all his productions.\r\nHis portraits are faithful, characteristic, and most artistic\r\nrepresentations; idealizing the individual; and in this branch of his\r\nart he undoubtedly outstripped all rivals. His success was very great.\r\nHe began life as a carver’s apprentice, and was a journeyman carver in\r\nLondon, where he helped with his own hand to furnish the dining-room of\r\nMr. Rogers, the poet--a room in which many times, in after life, he sat,\r\none of the most welcome and sociable of the guests there assembled.\r\nWealth and honour came to him earned by labour and perseverance; and the\r\nfruits of his industry, amounting to £90,000, he bequeathed to the Royal\r\nAcademy, for the purchase of “works of fine art of the highest merit in\r\npainting and sculpture,” such works “being executed within the shores of\r\nGreat Britain.” The bequest was worthy of a man whose mind, whose works,\r\nwhose habits, all bore the strong impress of the nation in which he was\r\nborn, and of the people from whose heart he had sprung.\r\n\r\n  [By his pupil, F. W. Smith.]\r\n\r\n398A. FRANCIS CHANTREY. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Medallion by Heffernan.]\r\n\r\n399. WILLIAM MULREADY. _Painter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Ennis, in Ireland, 1786. Still living.]\r\n\r\nAn honoured name in British art, and undoubtedly the head of the\r\ncharming and peculiar style which he adopted, after having employed his\r\ngenius on larger and more striking subjects. He has risen from obscurity\r\nby the force of genius, and given to the world works which will not\r\nreadily perish. When fourteen years old admitted a student at the Royal\r\nAcademy. Elected Royal Academician in 1816. His works reveal great\r\ndelicacy and purity of mind. He is a consummate draughtsman and\r\ncolourist; and in the refined beauty and finish of his pictures, is not\r\nsurpassed by any of his contemporaries. Amongst his best works may be\r\nreckoned those in the Vernon Gallery and in the collection of Mr.\r\nSheepshanks.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore. 1830.]\r\n\r\n400. JOHN GIBSON. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Conway, N. Wales, 1790. Still living.]\r\n\r\nLike Chantrey, apprenticed to a wood-carver, and, like him also, a\r\ncabinet-maker at this starting-point of his career. At the age of\r\neighteen, he exhibited a wax model of “Time,” which procured him\r\nemployment with a sculptor in Liverpool. Making the acquaintance of Lord\r\nCastlereagh, he was furnished by that nobleman with an introduction to\r\nCanova, and he accordingly set out for Rome in 1820. In Rome he still\r\nresides. He has wrought with his chisel for the noble and wealthy of his\r\nown country, and for the patrons of art in the land which he has chosen\r\nfor his residence. Ludwig of Bavaria--the eager and munificent patron of\r\nart--has been amongst the serviceable friends of the gifted Welshman.\r\nFor grace, beauty, and finished execution, John Gibson has never been\r\nsurpassed in this country. Flaxman is the first of British artists; but\r\nas a sculptor, chisel in hand, Gibson is hardly second even to him.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by Theed.]\r\n\r\n400A. JOHN GIBSON. _Sculptor._\r\n\r\n  [This bust is by Macdonald of Rome.]\r\n\r\n401. WILLIAM CHARLES MACREADY. _Player._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1793. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe son of William Macready, who was author, actor, and manager.\r\nEducated at Rugby. Made his first appearance on the stage as Romeo, at\r\nBirmingham, and his debût in London, in 1816, as Orestes, in the\r\n“Distressed Mother.” He continued in London a leading tragic actor,\r\nuntil he finally retired from the stage in 1851. Mr. Macready’s style of\r\nacting was of the romantic, rather than of the classic order; his\r\n“Virginius” a more masterly performance than “Hamlet,” his “Rob Roy” far\r\nmore picturesque and striking than “Richard III.” In the representation\r\nof Shakspeare’s characters this popular actor was not, generally\r\nspeaking, equal to the most celebrated of his contemporaries. His\r\nconceptions were not the conceptions formed by the intellectual portion\r\nof his auditory in the tranquillity of the study. It was, however,\r\nimpossible to witness a more admirable execution of a wrong conception,\r\nthan that which Mr. Macready was able to render. In private life he has\r\ndone honour to his profession; and he has left no actor behind him.\r\nsuperior to himself.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n402. GEORGE CRUIKSHANK. _Caricaturist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1794. Still living.]\r\n\r\nLike Tom Hood, George Cruikshank is something more than a humourist: or,\r\nto speak more correctly, like all great humourists, both he and Hood\r\npossess and reveal a deep perception and appreciation of the serious and\r\nthe pathetic in Nature and Art. The labours of Cruikshank, which\r\ncommenced at a very early period of his life, have been incessant and\r\nremarkable. His admirable illustrations have adorned books of all kinds,\r\nfrom the political “House that Jack built,” to the moral “Bottle.” At no\r\nperiod has he drawn a line which--however cutting may have been the\r\nsatire employed--has not had for its object the benefit, as well as the\r\namusement of his fellow-men. His latest works--attacking the most\r\ndegrading of our national vices,--command our gratitude and respect.\r\nGeorge is popular amongst his associates. His face is an index to his\r\nmind. There is nothing anomalous about him and his doings. His\r\nappearance, his illustrations, his speeches are all alike,--all\r\npicturesque, artistic, full of fun, feeling, geniality, and quaintness.\r\nHis seriousness is grotesque, and his drollery is profound. He is the\r\nprince of living caricaturists, and one of the best of men.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n403. ROBERT VERNON. _Patron of Art._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1774. Died in London, 1849. Aged 75.]\r\n\r\nA benefactor to his country, who amassed a fortune in business, and\r\nexpended his wealth in the formation of a gallery of pictures by British\r\nartists. Whilst living, he proved himself the benefactor of struggling\r\ngenius. Dying, he bequeathed his works of art to the nation. His\r\npictures are now collected at Marlborough House, where they form “The\r\nVernon Gallery.”\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n404. FANNY BUTLER. _Actress._\r\n\r\n  [Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Charles Kemble: and a popular actress of her day. She\r\nmade her first appearance at Covent Garden Theatre, October 5, 1829, in\r\nthe character of Juliet; and the sensation she then created rescued the\r\ntheatre from the difficulties into which it had fallen. She married Mr.\r\nButler, an American, and is the authoress of one or two well-written\r\ntragedies and other works.\r\n\r\n  [By Dantan, of Paris.]\r\n\r\n405. ADELAIDE SARTORIS. _Vocalist._\r\n\r\n  [Still living.]\r\n\r\nSecond daughter of Charles Kemble: highly distinguished as a vocalist of\r\nthe Italian school; she made her first appearance at Covent Garden\r\nTheatre, in Norma, Nov. 2, 1841, and sang and acted with great success\r\nat the same theatre in 1841 and 1842; but at the end of 1842 she retired\r\nfrom her profession into private life.\r\n\r\n  [By Dantan, of Paris.]\r\n\r\n405*. GRACE DARLING. _Lighthouse-keeper’s Daughter._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bamborough, Northumberland, 1815. Died 1842. Aged 27.]\r\n\r\n          “ONE whose very name bespeaks\r\n    Favour divine, exalting human love;\r\n    Whom, since her birth on bleak Northumbria’s coast,\r\n    Known unto few, but prized as far as known,\r\n    A single act endears to high and low,\r\n    Through the whole land.”--WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\nGrace was the seventh child of a humble man who had charge of a\r\nlighthouse on one of the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland.\r\nIn the month of September, 1888, the “Forfarshire” steamer, of 300 tons,\r\nhaving on board sixty-three souls, during a terrible storm and dense\r\nfog, struck on a rock within a mile of the light-house. It was deep\r\nnight. The ship snapped in half. Nearly all the creatures on board were\r\nswallowed by the chafing sea; and when morning broke, all that remained\r\nof the “Forfarshire” and its people, were nine of the passengers\r\nclinging to the windlass in the forepart of the vessel. It was a fearful\r\nmorning, the fog still prevailing--the sea hardly less boisterous.\r\nThrough the mist, however, the sad spectacle could be witnessed from the\r\nmainland, and a reward was offered to any boat’s crew that would venture\r\nto the rescue. It was offered in vain. But the despairing castaways were\r\nvisible also from the lighthouse, where none was rich enough to offer\r\nreward of any kind, for the sole inhabitants were husband, wife, and\r\ndaughter. It was the last watch before extinguishing the light at\r\nsunrise, and Grace was keeping it. She intreated her father to go to\r\nsea, and he consenting, the girl shared his boat, and the pair in dread\r\nand awe put off. Why speak of danger? Why detail the miracle? The risk\r\nwas incalculable. The chances of recovery, nay, of self-preservation,\r\nwere infinitesimal. But God strengthened the woman’s arm, as he had\r\nvisited her heart, and, after painful labour, the rescue was effected.\r\nThe delivered nine were taken to the lighthouse, and there kindly\r\ntreated by the heroic girl and her aged parents. The spirit of the\r\nnation was stirred by the act. Money enough to provide for her as long\r\nas she should live, and gifts innumerable, were brought to her sea-girt\r\nrock; but she would not leave the light-house. Why should she? What\r\nplace so fitting to hold this queen? She held her modest Court there\r\nuntil her early death. One who visited her speaks of her genuine\r\nsimplicity, her quiet manner, her perfect goodness. In 1841, symptoms of\r\nconsumption--the poisonous seed sown, it may be, on that drear\r\nmorning--revealed themselves. In a few months she died, quietly,\r\nhappily, religiously. Shortly before her death, she received a farewell\r\nvisit from one of her own sex, who came in humble attire, to bid her God\r\nspeed on her last illimitable journey. The good sister was the Duchess\r\nof Northumberland, and her coronet will shine the brighter for all time,\r\nbecause of that affectionate and womanly leave-taking. Joan of Arc has\r\nher monument. Let Grace of Northumbria have none. Her deed is\r\nregistered--\r\n\r\n        “in the rolls of Heaven, where it will live\r\n    A theme for angels when they celebrate\r\n    The high-souled virtues which forgetful earth\r\n    Has witnessed.”\r\n\r\n  [Medallion by David Dunbar. Modelled from the marble bust in the\r\n  possession of the Bishop of Durham. The original model was taken. from\r\n  the life at the Longstone lighthouse, soon after the incident above\r\n  recorded, and three years before the death of Grace.]\r\n\r\n405.** WILLIAM DARLING. _Lighthouse-Keeper._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1783. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe father of Grace Darling. He succeeded his own father as keeper of\r\nthe Coal-light on the Brownsman, the outermost of the Farne islands, on\r\nthe coast of Northumberland. In 1826, he was transferred to the\r\nlighthouse on the Longstone, another of the same group of islands.\r\nSolitary, cut off for weeks from communication with the mainland, this\r\nhumble man has passed his days in self-improvement. He is intelligent,\r\nquiet, and well-conducted. His children have received a good education\r\nfor their position in life, the father being the sole instructor--and\r\none daughter at least has not thrown discredit upon her bringing up.\r\n\r\n  [By David Dunbar.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETS AND DRAMATISTS.\r\n\r\n406. GEOFFREY CHAUCER. _The Father of English Poetry._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1328. Died there, 1400. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the gulf of years, the poetical sire of Shakspeare. He\r\nto whom, in an age which we call dark, the full sun of poetry shone. He\r\nwhose lineaments and gesture, transmitted by a contemporary pencil, are\r\nhere before us. He whose eye, though downcast, reads the world around\r\nhim, as it sounds the interior of Man: whose grave look of thought hides\r\nthe soul of mirth. What phase of our various life seems strange to him?\r\nTo this he is at home in experience; to that in imagination. With what\r\nHomeric power has he not described the tournament where kings fight in\r\nthe lists at Athens! What mediæval romance in the loves of Palamon and\r\nArcite! What an oriental colour and grace in the Squier’s half-told tale\r\nof the Tartar Cambuscan! You read tale after tale, and wonder which of\r\nthe diversified strains was indeed the most native to the heart of the\r\npoet. One critic will tell you--the broad coarse mirth--Never believe\r\nit! See with what lingering and tender fondness he brings out the\r\nsorrowful story of the pure, innocent, and falsely accused Custance,\r\nabandoned to the wild, drifting sea. How patiently he tells the trials\r\nof the patient Griseldis--how sternly the self-doom of those two impious\r\nchallengers of death. To Chaucer was given an insight of which nothing\r\neludes the scrutiny, a sympathy of which nothing lies beyond the\r\nembrace. And in what spring-like vigour and bloom of life that vanished\r\nworld rises again before us! What truth! and what spirit! Under his\r\nquill the speech of England first rose into the full form and force of a\r\nlanguage. Look up at him! He seems to be scanning thought and word,\r\nboth. Mine host of the Tabard singling him out amongst the pilgrims, for\r\nthe teller of the next tale, says of him: “He seemeth elvish by his\r\ncountenance.”--Does he?\r\n\r\n  [For an account of this statue by Marshall, see No. 53, Handbook of\r\n  Modern Sculpture. There is an interesting contemporary portrait of\r\n  Chaucer in the British Museum, bearing date 1400, from which the idea\r\n  of this statue is borrowed.]\r\n\r\n407. WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Stratford-on-Avon, 1564. Died there, 1616. Aged 52.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakspeare stands at the head of those whose intellectual\r\ndomain is the spirit of man. This is the master character of his mind,\r\nto which poetry is in him an accidental direction. His insight into man\r\nis his title to universal interest. He is the chief painter of humanity\r\nthat the world has seen, combining, at once, perfect intimate knowledge\r\nof human nature, and perfect creative power of representation. The drama\r\nhad suddenly awakened in his country, and he obeyed the instinct of his\r\ntime, the poetic bent of which was created for him, as he for it. There\r\nwere with him, before him, and immediately after him, great poets, with\r\nwhom the dramatic elements existed in high native strength and beauty;\r\nbut in him alone are those elements mastered, so as to produce entire\r\nworks of art, complete in power, and in consistent, though not regular,\r\nform. Sharing the intuition of Aristotle, which makes the action in the\r\nplay the root out of which the characters and all else grow, he directs\r\nthe stream of events as connectedly as it flows in the human world; and,\r\nas in the world, so in his inspired writing--agents appear born for\r\ntheir work, as the work to do seems to offer itself to the agents. All\r\nbeauties of language, all flights of poetry, all particular scenes and\r\nspeeches, powerful and impressive as they may be, are merely\r\nsubordinate. No character, how exquisitely or elaborately soever\r\nconceived and finished, is drawn for itself; but one and all are\r\nrelative to the scope of the play and to one another. He seems to have\r\nundertaken a great task, and to be seriously and solely intent upon\r\nadvancing to its fulfilment. No form of human life is foreign to him;\r\nthe most heroic and the humblest, the most illustrious and the most\r\nobscure, of all times, in all places, are in presence before him. He\r\nseizes the spirit of time, place, and theme. Natural, preternatural,\r\nlight, weighty, laughter, tears, terror, are all alike to him---all\r\nunder his mastery, and flung forth with free power. Grace and gigantic\r\nstrength, are spirits equally at his bidding. The learned and the\r\nunlearned are both attracted by his spell. The ignorant feel the\r\nfascination, the erudite have never exhausted the study. His country,\r\nwith her innumerable titles to renown, ranks amongst the highest his\r\ngreat name. With school instruction of the most ordinary kind, by\r\nuniversal and unerring observation, by profound and intense meditation\r\nof men, with the creative power of the highest imagination, he gave out,\r\nspontaneously, works of that kind whose study makes men learned: and\r\nthey are so viewed and studied by all civilized nations, every day more\r\nand more, at home and abroad. In him England competes for the crown of\r\npoetical glory with all other nations of old or modern fame. She has had\r\nother great poets, but they all, besides their own natural offerings,\r\nhave brought poetry from other lands and languages, into their own. In\r\nhim alone she feels, that what she displays SHE has produced. Little is\r\nknown of the life of William Shakspeare.\r\n\r\n  [From the well-known monumental bust in the church at\r\n  Stratford-on-Avon, where Shakspeare lies buried. It was executed by an\r\n  artist named Gerard Johnson, very soon after the death of Shakspeare,\r\n  and erected between 1616 and 1620. The original is in common\r\n  limestone, and was painted to resemble life. The eyes were a light\r\n  hazel, the hair and beard auburn: the doublet was scarlet, and the\r\n  loose gown black. It was repainted precisely in the same manner in\r\n  1749. But in 1793, Malone officiously had it whitewashed, as it now\r\n  exists. There is a great resemblance between this face from the\r\n  Stratford monument and the portrait published in the first folio of\r\n  Shakspeare’s works, by the actors, in 1623. No. 407A is from a very\r\n  remarkable terracotta bust, in the possession of Professor Owen, of\r\n  the College of Surgeons. It was discovered in pulling down the old\r\n  Duke’s Theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where it was placed over one\r\n  of the stage-doors, the bust of Ben Jonson (accidentally destroyed by\r\n  the workmen) occupying a corresponding place over the other door.\r\n  Shakspeare having been rescued by the timely interposition of Mr.\r\n  Clift, Professor Owen’s father-in-law, the bust became that\r\n  gentleman’s property, and by him it was given to its present owner.\r\n  There are two types of the Shakspeare portrait: the “round-faced,” as\r\n  seen in the monument of Stratford-on-Avon, and the “oval-faced” of\r\n  Cornelius Jansen. Roubilliac’s bust, and that in the possession of\r\n  Professor Owen, are after Jansen. No. 407B is the bust by Roubilliac.\r\n  The statues by Roubilliac and John Bell (see Handbook of Modern\r\n  Sculpture, Nos. 56 and 9) are conventional, and represent the two\r\n  types.]\r\n\r\n  407A.}\r\n       } WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE. _Poet._\r\n  407B.}\r\n\r\n408. JOHN MILTON. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1608. Died there, 1674. Aged 66.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a scrivener. In his earliest years he became enamoured of the\r\nMuses, wrote exquisite poetry, travelled in Italy, returned hastily on\r\nthe outbreak of the Civil war, and identified himself with the\r\nRepublican party. Later in life, and as blindness was deepening upon\r\nhim, he was appointed by Cromwell Latin Secretary to the Council of\r\nState. Retiring from politics on the death of the Protector, he would,\r\nunder the Restoration, have suffered as a regicide, had not Sir William\r\nDavenant, to his great honour, interposed his own favour with the Court.\r\nSo rescued, Milton withdrew into obscurity and poverty, unnoticed and\r\nforgotten. In his solitude and blindness he composed “Paradise Lost,”\r\nwhich he dictated chiefly to his eldest daughter. The poem was sold to a\r\nbookseller for ten pounds, and was not very popular during the lifetime\r\nof the poet. At one time he took pupils. He was three times married, was\r\ndevoutly religious, austere in his morals, and simple in his ways of\r\nlife. He is the great epic poet of England, distinguished by the\r\nstrength and sublimity of his genius, and hardly less for sensibility to\r\nthe graceful and beautiful. Laboriously learned, with an admiration as\r\nintelligent as devoted, of the great writings preserved from Greek and\r\nRoman antiquity, he, more than any other of our poets, has modelled his\r\nworks on the type of his illustrious predecessors. He has, of all\r\nEnglish poets, carried art in his writings to the highest pitch, but\r\nneither art nor imitation has tamed the wing of his muse, or impaired\r\nhis praise of originality. He knew the greatness of his powers, viewing\r\nthem as a gift to be used to the honour of the Giver; and his one\r\nparamount work, the “Paradise Lost,” having for its “great argument,” as\r\nhe himself says, “to justify the ways of God to men,” must be regarded\r\nas his oblation, brought and laid on the Altar. He founded and formed\r\nEnglish heroic blank verse,--a measure which, under his hand, rivals in\r\nrichness and variety the music of his classical masters; and which alone\r\ncould, by its majestic flow and inexhaustible powers of expression, have\r\nsustained the weight and amplitude of his subject. He loved and honoured\r\nShakspeare.\r\n\r\n409. ALEXANDER POPE. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1688. Died at Twickenham, 1744. Aged 56.]\r\n\r\nAlexander Pope, the son of a linendraper, and a Roman Catholic, was his\r\nown instructor. He was sent home from school in his twelfth year for\r\nlampooning his tutor, and from that time he gave his teachers no further\r\ntrouble. Already, as a boy, a happy versifier--twice happy, for an\r\nindulgent father smiled on his dawning skill--he was, in his maturer\r\nday, and for the remainder of his own century, the leading star in the\r\nsky of our English poetry. He received at the hands of his master,\r\nDryden, the rhymed ten-syllable couplet. This couplet was not first by\r\nDryden used harmoniously, forcibly, eloquently--for Hall in his Satires\r\nhad done this--but by Dryden it was first raised into the reigning\r\nmeasure of English song. He sustained in it a free flow and bold sweep,\r\nsuitable to his genius. Pope rather chained the movement, stamping even\r\non his verse the peculiarity of his fine intellectual powers. When we\r\nsearch for Pope’s characteristic amongst poets, we find that he had\r\nreasoning--which is the earnest,--and wit--which is the sporting--of the\r\nlogical faculty, both intimately blending themselves with the poetic\r\nvein. It was, accordingly, to a bright and sharp intellectual action\r\nthat he fitted the couplet, apt by its nature for the service. Uniting\r\nto a lively, quick and keen intellect, so much of poetic passion as, in\r\nfact, secured the dedication of a life, he produced works which, by\r\ntheir mastery, must command admiration whilst the language is read,\r\nalthough in them, the deliberate skill predominates over the passionate\r\nexpression. Viewed from the highest point, he was imitative, not\r\noriginal. His spirit active and perceptive in the study of his greater\r\nand less predecessors, not self-infused into the contemplation of Man\r\nand Nature. What is most felt as a fire in his verse is the ardency of\r\nwriting, the zeal of an artist enamoured of his task: or he accepts and\r\ntranslates the passion of others, which, not having its home in its own\r\nbosom, does not receive justice there. Our grandfathers and our\r\ngrandmothers knew by heart the “Essay on Man,” the “Essay on Criticism,”\r\nthe “Moral Essays,” the “Characters of Women” (sparkling with wit and\r\nmalice, but adding nothing to the observation and true ideal delineation\r\nof woman), and the “Rape of the Lock,” in which the playfulness, lying\r\nin the verse, exquisitely comes out, and a graceful half-ironical fancy\r\namuses and captivates, but no steeping imagination subdues or transforms\r\nto its likeness. He introduces us again to Ariel, whom we have known\r\nbefore, but how different his Ariel and Shakspeare’s. Pope brought\r\nintellective precision into poetry, which should feed on the indefinite\r\nand the vague, and should flower out into the softened and the flowing.\r\nHence, often when he is the most admirable, he is the most artificial.\r\n\r\n410. OLIVER GOLDSMITH. _Poet and Man of Letters._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Ireland, 1728. Died in London, 1774. Aged 45.]\r\n\r\nPoor dear Oliver! What shall we say of him, with his kindly benevolence,\r\nhis manly independence, his honest feeling, his childish vanity, his\r\nnaughty extravagance, his irregularities, his blunders, his idleness,\r\nhis industry, his zeal for the improvement and advancement of the whole\r\nworld, and his improvident neglect of himself. Goldsmith had fits of\r\ngenius:--moments of an inspiration, or a possession, that appeared to\r\nproduce in him powers, not ordinarily there. In the conduct of life he\r\nseemed born to be the world’s victim: he lay under the world. His gifted\r\npen in his hand, he rose above it. The tender sensibility that indites\r\nhis verse agrees too well to his story. The playful humour, and the\r\nsharp, never rough, never malignant, satire, take by surprise. He then\r\nhad the laughers on his side--too often, unfortunately, against him. His\r\npoems of “The Traveller” and “The Deserted Village” are a species by\r\nthemselves, or each a species. The vein of reflexion, of personal\r\nfeeling, and of poetical viewing, with native simplicity of expression\r\nand musical sweetness, is common to the two. The dirge of the deserted\r\nhamlet sowed the seed of “The Pleasures of Memory;” and the wandering\r\npoet, feeding his verse from his travels, was repeated in “Childe\r\nHarold.” Goldsmith’s “Retaliation,” written upon his friends of the St.\r\nJames’s Coffee House, in requital of the epitaphs they had provided for\r\nhimself, is the most brilliant and masterly summing up of characters in\r\npointed words and streaming verse that the language possesses. The\r\n“Vicar of Wakefield” is the smiled-at, honoured, and loved inmate of\r\nevery English home.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n410*. ROBERT BURNS. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Alloway, Ayrshire, 1759. Died at Dumfries, 1796. Aged 37.]\r\n\r\nThe ploughman-poet of Scotland; in whom the labour of the limbs appeared\r\nto invigorate the intelligence, and the bleak air of poverty to cherish\r\nthe blossoms of genius. Shakspeare rose from the bosom of the people to\r\ndelineate kings and queens. Burns, born some steps lower, dwelt, even in\r\nhis verse, to the last, amongst his own order. That is his dignity and\r\nhis glory. The life of the Scottish peasant as it remains represented by\r\nhis pencil, and in his person, seizes the imagination and the sympathies\r\nof the educated world. He has drawn the heart of the high towards the\r\nlow. He has raised the low to their just esteem in the opinion of the\r\nhigh. But besides this moral aspect, he has gained, as a poet,\r\nimmeasurably, by rooting his foot to the fields which he furrowed. The\r\nconflict, so maintained in our thoughts between his social position and\r\nhis endowments and aspirations, sheds a continual illumination of wonder\r\nupon his writings. But more! His happiest subjects and strains draw life\r\nand meaning from the soil of which they are the self-sown flowers. Not\r\nmerely that solitary agricultural Idyl, with its homely-pathetic and\r\nhomely-picturesque--“The Cotter’s Saturday Night,”--but the fanciful\r\ntenderness of his lament over the Daisy and the Mouse;--but the wild and\r\nreckless daring of imagination in that cordial rencounter with the dread\r\nfoe Death--that blending of the humorous, the supernaturally grotesque\r\nand the terrific in Tam O’Shanter--of the rustic, the gracious, the\r\nsolemn, even the sublime--in the Vision of Coila--these most\r\ncharacteristic feats of poetical skill and genius--which stand apart,\r\ndefying competition and claiming rank for the name of Burns, amongst the\r\nillustrious on Parnassus--all are made possible by originating from and\r\nby reflecting his native condition. His songs are tender, passionate,\r\nmusical; chaunting his own or imaginary rustic loves. The torrent of his\r\nspirit, that, pouring along the channels of thought and song, became an\r\nelate and exalting enthusiasm, hurried him on the paths of common life\r\ninto excesses, dilapidating the humble home and the proud householder.\r\nHe first published his poems--now in every peasant’s cottage throughout\r\nScotland--in his 27th year, and his fame was instantaneous. Later in\r\nlife, the favour and patronage of the Scottish nobility and gentry were\r\nable to confer upon him a place in the Excise, of no less than £70\r\na-year: in the discharge of which distinguished public function, and in\r\nthe enjoyment of which splendid public remuneration--then his only\r\ncertain support--the one-laurelled modern singer of the time-honoured\r\nScottish tongue sank, from his darkening noon, into the grave.\r\n\r\n  [This Bust is by David Dunbar.]\r\n\r\n411. SAMUEL ROGERS. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Newington Green, near London, 1762. Still living.]\r\n\r\nA classic inheritance from the entombed past. The living poet who\r\ncarried his first production with a trembling hand to Dr. Johnson’s\r\nhouse in Bolt Court, Fleet Street, and could not find heart to wait for\r\nan answer to his summons when he had knocked at the door; who listened\r\nwith delight and instruction to the lectures of Sir Joshua Reynolds; and\r\nwho still remembers and relates how, when his father took him to see\r\nGarrick act, he himself punished his boyish impatience by closing his\r\neyes for a moment, as the great actor was coming on to the stage. It is\r\nnearly seventy years since Samuel Rogers published his first poem, and\r\nhe was then a man. He is the Addison of verse. Grace, elegance,\r\ndelicacy, softness, are the characteristics of his poetry. He does not\r\nastonish by power, nor thrill by burning passion; but he soothes,\r\ngratifies, and charms all who are susceptible of consolation and\r\npleasure from polished and complete works of art. His taste is refined\r\nand classical, and all his works have the finish which such taste will\r\nrequire of the artist possessing it. The rhythm of his poetry partakes\r\nof the character of the sentiment: all is chaste, smooth, refined, and\r\nclear. The descriptions in “Italy” of Italian life and scenery are very\r\nbeautiful, and his reflections are at all times pure and elevating. For\r\nso long a life, Mr. Rogers has written very little; but his works are\r\ngems, and have been heightened and improved by labour until scrupulous\r\nthought can do for them nothing more. All poets since the century began\r\nhave acknowledged Rogers for a master; and his conscientiousness,\r\npurity, and refinement, fit him for a teacher. He has outlived not only\r\nhis illustrious contemporaries, but the great poets who were unborn when\r\nhe had reached his prime. The patriarch, in his long protracted\r\nnightfall, still gladdens his memory with the visions of the past,\r\nlooking with placid hope towards his all but present future.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n412. WILLIAM WORDSWORTH. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cockermouth, 1770. Died at Rydal Mount, 1850. Aged 80.]\r\n\r\nThe most original of the poetical thinkers whom his day gave to his\r\ncountry. Her verse, notwithstanding one or two better voices uplifted,\r\nhad too long and too patiently worn the character of an imitative\r\nliterature. He undertook the championship of a conflict, which was to\r\nreseat legitimate powers on the throne. Born and bred in the northern,\r\nmountain region of England, his first study of men was amongst the\r\nsimple-minded, vigorous, independent, and intelligent peasantry of the\r\ndales. The earth, which his young feet explored, lay embosoming its\r\nlakes, rearing crag and steep, as though yet freshly robed in\r\nloveliness, or charged with power, by the Creator’s hand. His instinct\r\nalready drew him, even unconsciously, to gather, in _that_ contemplation\r\nof Man and of Nature, and not in books, the materials of his appointed\r\nArt. Solitary, self-communing, self-sufficing, he soon stood in presence\r\nwith an educated world, the prophet of a new poetical revelation. He\r\nfound, at the first encounter, a prophet’s reward--belief in the few:\r\nfrom the multitude, mockery and persecution. He lived long enough to be\r\nunderstood; to see health and strength of his infusing reanimate the too\r\nlanguid veins of our English poesy. An extreme trust in the worth\r\ninhering in every phase of humanity may have sometimes descended too\r\nlow, in the choice of the theme; an excessive zeal of simplicity may\r\noccasionally have stripped the style a little too bare. But his writings\r\nremain distinguished, amongst the lays of his own just elapsed age, as\r\nthe most soothing and instructive to the heart of the reader; and for\r\nthe generations of poets, rising and to rise, the most warning and\r\noracular. His strains have been remarkably various in length and weight,\r\nin manner and style. As a portrayer of human nature, he ranks amongst\r\nthose who have the most deeply and critically explored the workings of\r\nour mysterious heart and intellectual being. His especial vocation\r\namongst poets was, in his own view, the disclosure of the affinities\r\nwhich attract, by feeling, the human soul to the natural world: It\r\nsupplying intellectual forms, and We, passion--an intercourse, blending,\r\nif it may be so said, two lives into one. He entered upon his work of\r\nreforming our poetical spirit, in two volumes of Lyrical Ballads and\r\nOther Poems, in the years 1798 and 1807. His life was one long day of\r\nbrooding calm--his sunset, lucid and serene.\r\n\r\n  [Presented to the Crystal Palace by the sculptor, F. Thrupp, and\r\n  modelled by him from a cast after death by Chantrey.]\r\n\r\n413. SIR WALTER SCOTT. _Poet and Novelist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Edinburgh, 1771. Died at Abbotsford, 1832. Aged 61.]\r\n\r\nThe great magician of the north, under whose fascinating spell millions\r\nin all lands have been entranced and strengthened. His boyish eye fed on\r\nthe wild scenes of his native land, and on the mouldering wrecks--here\r\nand there sadly gracing those scenes--of her former sterner, yet greater\r\nday. His boyish heart was cradled in the music of her old wild songs,\r\nthen living, and in the rough and bold traditions of her strange and\r\nromantic Past. The joy and the passion which were life to the boy,\r\nbecame power to the man. With a wondrous dominion suddenly begun, yet\r\nprolonged whilst he lived, he swayed and swept back the spirits of his\r\ngeneration on a torrent of delight and desire, into forgotten times,\r\nalien to our manner of thinking and of being. But the poet finds one\r\nheart of Man under all the shapes of human existence: one universal\r\nspirit of human life. Transported by the poet, we find ourselves\r\neverywhere with our kind. Reanimated by him, the worn-out and the\r\nantiquated rise new-born and of our time. And Scott, in verse or in\r\nprose, was a poet. The electric telegraph of the press carried his\r\nwritings, as they left his desk, over the globe. The excellent French\r\nhistorian, Augustin Thierry, says that the romances of Scott, by their\r\nvivid and vital representations of the past, have reformed the style and\r\nstudy of history on the continent, urging and guiding the historian,\r\ninstead of chronicling dry facts, to throw himself with a thirsty\r\ninspiration into the bosom of the mighty departed time. A Scottish\r\ntraveller in Spanish California told, that a Spanish monk had there\r\nshown him his copy of “Ivanhoe,” and said “Next after my Bible.” We\r\nremember with pain that Scott, to whom the world stands so largely\r\nindebted for some of its purest delights, fell into trouble and\r\ndifficulty, and snapped his brain in his noble and manly struggle for\r\nescape. The spot of Scotland which the toil of his genius had won him,\r\nfor rooting his family on, when torn from both him and them by a blast\r\nof ill-fortune, was redeemed to them by the reverent affection of his\r\ncountry---made theirs by a public act which tied even every “book of his\r\ncurious learning” to its place on his shelves, in perpetuity. There his\r\nfavourite daughter’s daughter and her children now prolong, if not his\r\nillustrious name, his honoured line.\r\n\r\n  [By F. Chantrey.]\r\n\r\n414. ROBERT SOUTHEY. _Poet Laureate._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Bristol, 1774. Died at Keswick, in Cumberland, 1843. Aged\r\n  69.]\r\n\r\nAn author who has earned imperishable renown in his own country, for the\r\ndignity with which he upheld the literary character, for his virtuous\r\nmind, for his patient, honest industry, and for his masculine prose\r\nwritings. His poetical compositions--with the exception of the minor\r\npoems--are too laboured and too long, are too deliberately planned, and\r\nnot sufficiently impassioned to be immortal; but they contain,\r\nnevertheless, many fine descriptive passages, abounding in strength and\r\nbeauty: the subjects are chosen, and treated, with bold and free\r\nimagination. Southey read too much, and reflected too little; he was an\r\ninsatiable devourer of books, and almost a prisoner to his study; hence\r\nhe imbibed prejudices, and narrowed his intellectual sympathies: but his\r\nheart was of the soundest, and his feelings of the freshest. In the\r\ndistribution of his hours he was most methodical. He had a surprising\r\nmemory, a yearning towards the romantic in his literary pursuits, and an\r\ninsuppressible vein of humour. He lived and died, comparatively poor,\r\nand he was always a day labourer. Yet he had ever a ready ear for the\r\ntale of distress, and an open hand for all who needed its grasp in the\r\ndifficult journey of life. He never murmured at his own inevitable yoke,\r\nand he had self-command enough to refuse a baronetcy, when, towards the\r\nclose of his career, he was offered the honour by the Minister of the\r\nday. It is sad to think that the mind of Southey gave way in the decline\r\nof life. When he could read no longer, he walked to his bookshelves with\r\na vacant soul, and opened the volumes only to look at them, without\r\nbeing able to derive the least consolation from their pages. He died\r\nhonoured, and literary men in England are proud to acknowledge, in him,\r\none of the worthiest of their order.\r\n\r\n  [This is a posthumous Bust, by E. H. Baily, R.A., from the marble\r\n  which forms a portion of the monument erected to the poet’s memory in\r\n  Bristol. It was carved in 1847.]\r\n\r\n415. THOMAS CAMPBELL. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Glasgow, 1777. Died at Boulogne, 1844. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nThe poetical career of Thomas Campbell began when he was twenty years\r\nold, and was completed before he was thirty-three. He wrote nothing\r\nsubsequently to this age worthy of his fame. His earliest work, the\r\n“Pleasures of Hope,” composed in youth, at once established his claim to\r\nbe ranked amongst the foremost poets of his time. It brimmed with\r\npromise; and not the least singular circumstance in connexion with\r\nThomas Campbell’s life is, that the excessive expectation raised by his\r\nfirst appeal was never satisfactorily fulfilled. The poetic faculty\r\nburned in the “Pleasures of Hope,” which was full of melody, pathos,\r\nanimated description, and impassioned sentiment. All needful ardour was\r\nthere. There were also to be noted the faults of a youthful\r\npen--redundancy of diction and incorrectness. Ten years after the\r\n“Pleasures of Hope” he published “Gertrude of Wyoming.” The impulsive\r\nquality was already subdued by elaborate art; and although extreme\r\nbeauty and tenderness were here and there in the poem, correctness was\r\nstill wanting. Your spirit was entranced with verses, than which, in the\r\nEnglish language, you could find none better, simpler, and sweeter. Yet\r\nfor one such verse that was borne away from “Gertrude of Wyoming” a\r\nhundred were forgotten which were not its peers. Campbell had momentary,\r\ntrue, intense conceptions, and fineness of fancy; he exhibited\r\nfelicities of thought and expression that fastened instantly on every\r\nmemory; his, too, was an ear of poetical sensibility to the music of\r\nlanguage; but woe to the verse if his poetic utterance came not of an\r\ninspiration--by a seizing theme. “Ye Mariners of England,” “The\r\nSoldier’s Dream,” “The Battle of Hohenlinden,” constituted such themes,\r\nand these small poems of Campbell are consequently abiding treasures in\r\nthe literature of the nation.\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A. Executed in 1827.]\r\n\r\n416. THOMAS MOORE. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Dublin, 1780. Died in Wiltshire, 1852. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nA poet of exuberant fancy, revelling in lavish ornament and gorgeous\r\npainting, and giving utterance to the most ingenious creations, in\r\nlanguage of ineffable, and, occasionally, overpowering sweetness. A\r\nwriter of inimitable Irish ballads, which are now plaintive, now joyous,\r\nnow pathetic, now fervid, now tender, now fierce, now melting, now\r\nheroic; but always matchless by the graceful flow of the verse, and the\r\nprompt springing of the happiest illustration. Also the author of\r\nsatires, brilliant and cutting, but rather the outpourings of a generous\r\nfancy, delighting in its own exquisite self-conscious faculty of\r\nmischief, than the malicious and bitter expression of a vexed and\r\ndisappointed mind. Melody and joyance are careering in almost every\r\nsyllable that he wrote. He was a passionate lover of music, and when he\r\nsang his own ballads, the effect upon his listeners was electrical. His\r\nmost celebrated poetical composition is “Lalla Rookh,” an Eastern\r\nromance, which he wrote “amidst the snows of two or three Derbyshire\r\nwinters.” His best prose work, “The Epicurean,” is a masterly\r\nperformance, redolent of the perfume which breathes through his verse,\r\nand elevated by a high moral aim. When Thomas Moore died, the impression\r\nleft of the man upon the public mind was stamped there by his jocund\r\nmuse--a feeling of tenderness and love was associated with the pleasant\r\nmemory of “Little Tommy Moore.” Since his death his memoirs and his\r\ndiary have been published, and the impression has grown dimmer and\r\ndimmer in consequence. As a man, Thomas Moore, the poet, appears to have\r\nbeen hardly more heroic than the most prosaic of his kind.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore. Executed in 1838, for the late Edward Moore, of\r\n  Mayfair.]\r\n\r\n417. JOHN WILSON. _Poet and Professor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Paisley, 1785. Died in Edinburgh, 1854. Aged 69.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a Paisley manufacturer. Educated at Glasgow and Oxford. Like\r\nthe youth of ancient Greece, he delighted equally in the spoils of the\r\narena, and in the wisdom of the porch. At Oxford, the first wrestler of\r\nhis time, and the gainer of the Newdegate prize for the best poem. His\r\ngenius as passionate as his frame was overflowing with the sap of animal\r\nlife. Endowed with a lofty and glowing imagination, and with great\r\ncritical powers, improved by knowledge. A lover of learning for the joy\r\nit brings, and a hearty sympathizer with the glorious labours of the\r\ngreat makers of prose and verse, whether in ancient or modern time. He\r\nhimself excelled as a worker in more than one of the paths of\r\nliterature. His poetry is remarkable for the beauty of its imagery, for\r\nits rich fancy, and for the flow of the verse; his criticisms exhibit a\r\nprofound knowledge of the true principles of taste, are eloquent, and\r\nfull of generous sentiment; his prose tales of fiction have deep pathos,\r\nand reveal intimate acquaintance with the human heart. As an orator,\r\nJohn Wilson might have vied with the most eloquent of his contemporaries\r\nhad he chosen to compete with them in their own peculiar field; as a\r\nwriter upon the manly sports which he so ardently loved, he is\r\nunequalled. His very corporeal substance seems heaving with joy and\r\nphysical happiness, as we follow his vigorous, picturesque, and elated\r\npen, amongst the lochs of Scotland, or the lakes of Cumberland. Wilson\r\nwrote with the zeal of a strong partizan in politics. He would be one,\r\nand could not. His large and universal heart never entertained what are\r\ncalled political antipathies. His Toryism was his strong and hearty\r\nnature bubbling up and venting itself in loyalty, chivalry, and\r\naffectionate duty. To say that he was opposed to Liberty and Right, is\r\nto assert a monstrous paradox. He was the very incarnation of liberty,\r\nand his giant soul shrunk from wrong, by natural action. In 1818, Wilson\r\nwas appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of\r\nEdinburgh. The bust bespeaks the man. It looks like Jupiter. We cannot\r\ngaze upon a more magnificent head.\r\n\r\n  [This striking and characteristic work is by the late James Fillous of\r\n  Glasgow, a fellow townsman of Professor Wilson. It was executed in\r\n  marble for the Public Reading Room at Paisley.]\r\n\r\n418. GEORGE NOEL GORDON, LORD BYRON. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1788. Died at Missolonghi, in Greece, 1824. Aged 36.]\r\n\r\nAssuredly, the most popular, if not the greatest poet of our times. But,\r\nthe popularity by no means proof of the greatness. He was an object of\r\ninterest on account of his birth, his youth, his misfortunes, his\r\nconstant practice of associating with poetry his personal and daily\r\nhistory, his strongly imagined injuries, his feverish complaints. A\r\nvigorous painter of portraits--that is to say, of two, for he took\r\ndelight only in the hero of gloomy passion, and in the heroine of soft\r\nvoluptuous beauty--all his pictures more or less reflecting his own\r\nnature, and the nature of woman as it appeared to his refined\r\nsensuality. Byron has described with ineffable grandeur natural scenery,\r\nand has kindled the spirits of men with enthusiasm for the ancient\r\nglory; but we find no solace in his companionship, although he takes us\r\nto streams and mountains visited by the gods. His own distempered image\r\nis too visibly stamped on every scene. Byron affected to be a\r\nmisanthrope; yet he cherished the good opinion of men, and shrunk from\r\ntheir adverse criticism. He pretended that he was isolated from the\r\nworld; yet his name and fame were upon every lip. What will last in the\r\npoetry of Byron are the verses uttered in moments of self-oblivion.\r\nKeats complained that Byron made solemn things gay, and gay things\r\nsolemn. This was a great wrong, and is hardly repaired by the\r\ntenderness, pathos, sentiment, and passion, that start from his poetry\r\nto go straight to the heart. It was the misfortune of Byron to be sent\r\ninto the world without discipline or training of any kind. Had he been\r\nfairly dealt with in his childhood and youth, his life might have been\r\nhappier--its course more equable. As it was, his genius was enslaved and\r\nwronged, his career was violent and erratic, his whole nature warped,\r\nand his poetry, instead of being a well-trimmed garden of beauty, had\r\nits choicest flowers entangled and half hidden in unwholesome, gaudy\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\n  [By Thorwaldsen, but not from the life.]\r\n\r\n418A.

Still living.]\r\n\r\nBefore he was eleven years old, he went as midshipman to sea. Returned\r\nto London after two years’ service, and in his boyhood took to writing\r\ndramas for minor theatres. In later life he has produced dramatic works\r\nof a higher kind--his comedies being remarkable for epigrammatic wit,\r\nand sparkling dialogue. His prose writings, generally, are characterized\r\nby trenchant sarcasm, by a vigorous Saxon style, by earnestness of will,\r\nand by an unflinching advocacy of liberal principles. Douglas Jerrold\r\nhas been charged with bitterness of spirit, and a malicious desire to\r\nset the poor against the rich. The charge rests upon no good foundation.\r\nHe revolts from injustice and oppression; he feels acutely their effects\r\nupon all who come within their operation; and his views are invariably\r\nexpressed with all the intensity of his genuine convictions. His pen has\r\nbeen always at the service of humanity; and his heart is as sound as his\r\nlanguage is plain, direct, and unequivocal.\r\n\r\n  [Executed in marble, 1852, by E. H. Baily, R.A.]\r\n\r\n419*. HENRY TAYLOR. _Poet._\r\n\r\n  [Still living.]\r\n\r\nKnown to literature as the author of “Philip Van Artevelde,” a drama for\r\nthe study, not for the stage. This dramatic poem is admirably finished,\r\nand contains many beautiful images, and passages of undoubted vigour.\r\nBut the polish is too evident, the labour expended too much on the\r\nsurface. There is nothing in the work to offend; nothing to take by\r\nsurprise; nothing that stirs the human heart to its depths. The author\r\nshall defy you to point out the blemishes of genius on his pages. You\r\nmay equally challenge him to produce evidence of the power of genius. In\r\n“Philip Van Artevelde” we are ever within sight of the domain in which\r\nthe great dramatists reign supreme, but never in the domain itself. It\r\nis all but a great work. It seems as if only fire were wanting at the\r\npoet’s heart to convey us at once from the region of great talent to the\r\nhigher sphere of undoubted inspiration. But the needed warmth comes not.\r\n\r\n  [By Macdonald, of Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC MEN AND WRITERS.\r\n\r\n420. FRANCIS BACON. _Chancellor of England, and Founder of the Inductive\r\nPhilosophy._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1561. Died 1626. Aged 65.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal under Queen\r\nElizabeth. Francis was yet a boy when he evinced so keen and lively an\r\nintellect, that Elizabeth was wont to call him her young Lord Keeper. He\r\nrose to the highest distinction in the state, becoming Lord Chancellor\r\nof England. He was removed from his eminence, because he had sullied it\r\nby accepting bribes. He lived ostentatiously, and died leaving many\r\ndebts. His name is one of the greatest this country boasts. He is the\r\nfather of the modern Philosophy. Standing between two intellectual eras,\r\nhe surveyed the past, and predicted the future, of human inquiry.\r\nReverting his eye, he saw that the most acute and powerful intellects\r\nhad, age after age, wasted their strength in investigating physical\r\nphenomena, without fruit either of great ascertained truths, or of\r\nservice won from their speculations to human uses. Neither zeal nor\r\nability had been wanting. He inferred that the method of those elder\r\nphilosophers was in fault. Impatient and arrogant, they presumed, upon\r\nthe first strong impressions caught from the contemplation of Nature,\r\noracularly to divine her universal laws. From these laws, affirmed not\r\nestablished, they proceeded to solve, as best they could, all further\r\nphenomena: for, within these false and hasty conclusions once\r\nrecognised, Reason lay thenceforward imprisoned. Lord Bacon said: “Have\r\npatience. Wait upon Nature. Observe indefatigably. Accumulate, without\r\nceasing, records of the appearances. Verify experiment by experiment.\r\nSet instance beside instance, without sparing, but not without choosing.\r\nUltimately the law will stand revealed.” What has happened? Immense and\r\never-advancing discovery--science created upon science--observers,\r\nwithout number, conspiring in the most disjoined parts of the civilized\r\nworld to solve the same philosophical problems--Nature every day more\r\nand more yielding to man the service of her powers--and the wisdom of\r\nher Author every day more and more discerned in His works--these are the\r\nresults which honour the school of Bacon.\r\n\r\n  [From the monument at St. Albans.]\r\n\r\n421. HUMPHREY CHETHAM. “_Dealer in Manchester Commodities._”\r\n\r\n  [Born 1580. Died 1653. Aged 73.]\r\n\r\nAn early and generous benefactor to the city of Manchester. One of\r\nFuller’s “Worthies of England.” He made a large fortune by sending\r\nManchester commodities up to London; and during his life-time he\r\ninvested his gains in the education of twenty-two poor boys. At his\r\ndeath he left money enough to provide for the suitable education of\r\nforty boys; and he also bequeathed £1000 for the purchase of books for a\r\ngeneral library, as well as £100 for the erection of a building to\r\nreceive them. At the present hour 100 boys are educated, maintained, and\r\nclothed, by the munificence of Humphrey Chetham, and more than 23,000\r\nvolumes are open to all who desire to improve themselves by reading. The\r\nstatue of which the one in the Crystal Palace is a cast, has been\r\nrecently raised to the memory of this pious and benevolent man, by one\r\nwho, in early life, partook of Humphrey Chetham’s bounty. The name of\r\nthe grateful recipient is unknown; but he need not blush to make it\r\npublic. The statue may be seen in Manchester Cathedral--a monument of\r\naffectionate reverence and gratitude, as well as of Christian\r\nwell-doing.\r\n\r\n  [For an account of this statue, see Handbook to Modern Sculpture, No.\r\n  62.]\r\n\r\n422. JOHN LOCKE. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Somersetshire, 1632. Died at Oates, in Essex, 1704. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nA stern intellect with a pious and gentle heart. Of a good family. He\r\nstudied for medicine; but his delicate health prevented his engaging in\r\nthe profession. The study was apparently turned to higher account in\r\nsettling his contemplation on the real and the useful. He ranks amongst\r\nEnglish philosophers as the one who first, by his writings, impressed\r\nthe fact that the Mind of Man lies before us, if we can attend, as much\r\na subject for observation and for the investigation of laws, as the\r\noutwardly sensible world. The impulse given by his teaching to the\r\neducated mind of the country was strong and lasting. His successors have\r\nintroduced, as might be expected, more method and precision into this\r\nregion of speculation. They have confirmed, enriched, and extended the\r\nscience, although yet far from having attained that luminous certainty,\r\nand that wealth of profitable results, which wonderfully reward the\r\ninquirers into the physical order of Nature. Besides his “Essay on the\r\nHuman Understanding”--for which Locke is called the founder, in England,\r\nof modern metaphysical inquiry--he stood up in other works also, as the\r\nchampion of intellectual liberty, vindicating the rights of Reason in\r\npolitics and in religion. In the study of the Mind, “he broke the\r\nfetters of the schools,” as Bacon had done for physical science. Locke\r\nwas the friend of Newton.\r\n\r\n  [By Riesback.]\r\n\r\n423. SIR ISAAC NEWTON. ASTRONOMER AND PHILOSOPHER.\r\n\r\n  [Born at Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, 1642. Died in London, 1727. Aged\r\n  85.]\r\n\r\nThis illustrious man was educated at Grantham, and entered Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, in the year 1660. Before he had reached his\r\ntwenty-third year, he had already made various important discoveries in\r\npure mathematics; amongst others, the celebrated “Binomial Theorem,”\r\nfamiliar to every tyro, and that most refined and powerful instrument of\r\nscientific investigation, the “Method of Fluxions,” which, a few years\r\nlater, was independently discovered by the famous Leibnitz, and given to\r\nthe world in the form now universally known as the “Differential\r\nCalculus.” Newton was still young when the fall of an apple gave birth\r\nin his mind to the first germ of “the Law of Gravitation,” which, some\r\nyears later, he so beautifully and wonderfully developed. In 1666--his\r\nage twenty-four--he began those experiments with the prism which quickly\r\nled him to “The Decomposition of Light,” and to other optical\r\ndiscoveries, unfolded in the lectures delivered by him at Cambridge, as\r\nthe successor of Barrow, from the year 1669. In his thirtieth year, he\r\nwas elected a fellow of the Royal Society; in 1703, its President; and\r\nhe was re-elected to this distinguished post year after year, for\r\ntwenty-five years. His great work, “Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia\r\nMathematica,” appeared complete in 1687. It has excited the astonishment\r\nand profound admiration of the greatest philosophers in all nations,\r\nfrom that time to the present; and no wonder, since, in some respects,\r\nthis grand production might almost seem to have resulted from actual\r\ninspiration, and not from the mere day labour of an unassisted human\r\nintellect. The mighty teacher was the originator of views and theories,\r\nupon which the ablest philosophical minds of the last century and of the\r\npresent have built their most renowned achievements, yet we are most\r\nadmonished by his humility, his religion, and his calm. Newton was\r\nmember of Parliament for Cambridge. He was also master of the Mint.\r\nHonour was shown to him living and dead. George I. ordered that his body\r\nshould, after lying in state, be buried in Westminster Abbey. What\r\nluminary is without its dark spot? Leibnitz and Newton were the two\r\ngreatest men of their age, yet a bitter and lasting quarrel between them\r\nis recorded, for our solemn instruction. It remains to state that the\r\nyear in which Galileo died, Newton was born. No interval was suffered\r\nbetween the extinction of the one essential light and the kindling of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n  [By Roubilliac.]\r\n\r\n424. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. _Statesman and Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Boston, in America, 1706. Died at Philadelphia, in America,\r\n  1790. Aged 84.]\r\n\r\n“Franklin” is another word for usefulness, self-denial, frugality,\r\nperseverance, and independence. A poor printer’s boy, who, by his own\r\nunaided powers raised himself from the lowest place of society to the\r\nhighest, and contributed alike to the advancement of science, and to the\r\nindependence of one of the finest countries of the earth. His discovery\r\nof the identity of lightning and electricity, and the invention of the\r\nlightning-rod; the explanation of the _aurora borealis_ and\r\nthunder-gusts upon electrical principles, are triumphs of the\r\nphilosopher. His ardent support of the new Republic, his activity,\r\njudgment, and resources, speak for the statesman and the lover of\r\nliberty. His language unadorned, but ever pure and expressive; his\r\nreasoning manly and cogent, and so concise that he never exceeded a\r\nquarter of an hour in any public address. His correspondence a model of\r\nclearness and compendious brevity. Scrupulously punctual in all his\r\ndealings. An exemplar of economy, and regularity. His life, one of the\r\nmost instructive and encouraging studies for youth, since it exhibits\r\nthe sufferings, the trials, the power, and the victory of self-command,\r\ntemperance and industry, and the reward of genius overcoming all the\r\ndifficulties of fortune.\r\n\r\n  [By Houdon.]\r\n\r\n424A. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. _Statesman and Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [By Hiram Powers.]\r\n\r\n425. SAMUEL JOHNSON. _Writer and Moralist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Lichfield, 1709. Died in London, 1784. Aged 75.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a bookseller in Lichfield. Educated at Oxford, but compelled\r\nto leave the University without a degree, in consequence of the\r\nmisfortunes of his father. Then an usher,--and then, marrying,--the\r\nproprietor of a private academy in his native city. He had only three\r\npupils, but one of them was David Garrick. Master and pupil went up\r\ntogether to London in search of fortune. Both found what they\r\nsought--the pupil suddenly and brilliantly; the master, after trial,\r\nprivation, and suffering. In 1738, Johnson published his first poem,\r\n“London.” Twelve years later, he came forth as an essayist in the\r\n“Rambler.” In 1755, appeared his “Dictionary of the English Language,” a\r\nseven years’ labour; and in 1781, “The Lives of the Poets.” In 1762, a\r\npension of £300 a-year was settled upon him by King George III. The\r\ntradition of Johnson in society is of a literary and moral dictator--a\r\ncharacter which, as far as he was concerned, implied much rather the\r\ndepth of conviction with which he championed great interests, than the\r\npride of self-conscious intellect, the taste for conflict, or the thirst\r\nof rule; and which the listeners conceded yet more in reverence for the\r\npersonal worth of the man, than in submission to his intellectual\r\nsuperiority. He is one of the manliest and most robust minds in our\r\nletters. From moral sense and religion, from deep natural concern, his\r\ngiant will was devoted to the great interests of mankind. He felt in\r\nhimself a vocation to sustain these interests, and he was the sturdiest\r\nof combatants in the prosecution of his moral crusade. His style is\r\nstately, nervous, Latin, original, singularly suited to his mind, which\r\ngave a direction to contemporary minds, and largely fashioned the\r\nliterature of his time. The prime characteristic of his writings is\r\nunquestionably strong, solid sense, mixed it may be with onesidedness,\r\nbut bright with acute reflection. Johnson’s exterior was unwieldy, his\r\nmanners were not polished, but a tenderer heart never beat than his own.\r\nHe could utter a withering epigram. He never committed a deliberately\r\nunkind act. His house was a hospital for the sick and distressed; he\r\ncould not walk the streets without emptying his pockets into the hands\r\nof beggars, and his great heart melted under a tale of sorrow and\r\ninjustice. He had strong prejudices, and although sincerely pious, was\r\nsuperstitious. He loved to speak in aphorisms, and we still quote his\r\nsayings, as attributing to him something of the dignity and weight of an\r\noracle. His life influenced his age. After his death he still exercises\r\nhis influence, for he has given occasion to the most perfect and amusing\r\nbiography in the language.\r\n\r\n425A. SAMUEL JOHNSON. _Writer and Moralist._\r\n\r\n  [This statue, by J. Bacon, R.A., is at the South End of the Nave, on\r\n  the East Side; for account of which, see Handbook to Modern\r\n  Sculpture.]\r\n\r\n426. ADAM SMITH. _Philosopher and Political Economist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Kirkaldy, in Scotland, 1723. Died, in Edinburgh, 1790. Aged\r\n  67.]\r\n\r\nThis great master in the science of political economy was the son of an\r\nOfficer of Customs, and studied first in Glasgow, afterwards at Oxford.\r\nHe had feeble health, and was of studious habits. In 1748, a lecturer,\r\nin Edinburgh, upon Rhetoric and the Belles-Lettres; and in 1751,\r\nappointed Professor, first of Logic, and then of Moral Philosophy, in\r\nthe University of Glasgow. At this period of his life he published his\r\n“Theory of the Moral Sentiments,” a work in which he regards Sympathy as\r\nthe foundation of all morals. In 1763, resigning his Professorship, he\r\nbecame tutor to the young Duke of Buccleuch, with whom he travelled on\r\nthe continent for several years. He subsequently retired to his native\r\nvillage, where he passed ten years of his life in close obscurity,\r\nstudy, and fruitful meditation. In 1776, he issued from his cell to pour\r\nlight for ever into the busy world. In that year was published his\r\nmemorable “Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.”\r\nThis monument of industry, observation, sagacity, learning, and\r\nacuteness, continues the one great hand-book of political economists.\r\nThe leading points which Adam Smith laboured to urge in his “Inquiry”\r\nare--That labour is the only source of the wealth of nations; that\r\nwealth does not consist in the abundance of gold and silver, but in the\r\nabundance of the necessities, conveniences, and enjoyments of life; that\r\nit is sound policy to leave individuals to pursue their own interest in\r\ntheir own way, and that every regulation intended to force industry into\r\nparticular channels, is impolitic and pernicious. The justice of these\r\naxioms has, after years of argument, denial, and resistance, received\r\ngeneral acknowledgment in England; and Adam Smith is the author of one\r\nrevolution in the world’s progress, and a benefactor of his kind. His\r\nreasoning is not always sound; but the base of his fabric is\r\nunassailable, and the illustration which constitutes its ornament, is\r\namongst the happiest ever employed to give life and light to a solid\r\nstructure. Adam Smith is the great practical philosopher of an age and a\r\npeople, craving for his philosophy more than for any other, yet wanting,\r\nmost of all, the philosophy which shows the soul of a man as the most\r\nprecious of all his estates, and teaches him the husbandry of it. He\r\ndied, having won a competence, and fulfilling a government appointment.\r\n\r\n  [This plaster cast was formerly in the collection of Sir Thomas\r\n  Lawrence.]\r\n\r\n427. JOHN HUNTER. _Surgeon and Comparative Anatomist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Scotland, 1728. Died in London, 1793. Aged 65.]\r\n\r\nWhen John Hunter was twenty years old, he could scarcely read or write;\r\nbut he could make chairs and tables. At the time of his death,\r\nforty-five years afterwards, he was the first anatomist in the country;\r\nand he left behind him a museum--the work of his own rare intelligence\r\nand industry--which the government purchased for the sum of £15,000, and\r\nconferred upon the Royal College of Surgeons. Hunter came to London,\r\nfrom his carpenter’s shop in Scotland, in order to serve as anatomical\r\nassistant to his brother William, who had already established a\r\nreputation as an anatomist, and was doing well. In a few months John had\r\nmade sufficient advance to be able to give instruction in the\r\ndissecting-room. He then studied on his own account, went to Oxford, and\r\nbecame a surgeon. Intense application, profound observation, ceaseless\r\nexperiments, and masterly skill and judgment, enabled him in time\r\nconsiderably to enlarge the knowledge of surgery, and to make valuable\r\ndiscoveries in connexion with his favourite science of comparative\r\nanatomy. He was, for England, the first great leader in the Science of\r\nanimal life. He was a bold and clever operator; he wrote several\r\nprofessional treatises; and, besides being Surgeon Extraordinary to the\r\nKing, he held the offices of Inspector-General of Hospitals, and\r\nSurgeon-General. His name is honoured in the profession to which he\r\nbelongs, and he is justly regarded as the great and worthy guide and\r\npioneer of all the seekers and successful discoverers, who since his\r\ntime have explored the same paths.\r\n\r\n  [By Flaxman.]\r\n\r\n428. JAMES WATT. _Improver of the Steam-Engine._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Greenock, 1736. Died 1819. Aged 83.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the genius of Watt, as displayed in his mechanical\r\ninventions, has contributed more to show the practical utility of the\r\nsciences, to extend the power of man over the material world, to\r\nmultiply and expand the conveniences of life, than the works of any\r\nother individual in modern times. His was a rare mechanical genius. It\r\nhad been nurtured from his infancy at home; where he lived, as a boy, in\r\nsolitary retirement, cultivating observation and reflexion, and kept\r\napart from other boys by weak bodily health. It may be affirmed that his\r\nwhole life was one long day’s labour, for his enlightened industry never\r\nceased. When a mere child, he would take to pieces and reconstruct every\r\ntoy that came in his way. At nineteen he went to London, and placed\r\nhimself with a maker of mathematical instruments there, making delicate\r\ninstruments for his employer with his own hands. “With those same\r\nhands,” says M. Arago, a little fancifully, since the head now took the\r\nplace of the hands, “he afterwards constructed those colossal machines\r\nwhich in Cornwall, and on the ocean, perform the service of millions of\r\nhorses.” But the improvement of the steam-engine, until it attained its\r\nhighest point of perfection, is not Watt’s sole claim to the title of a\r\ndiscoverer. Without knowing a note of music, he constructed an organ,\r\nand in a great measure solved the problem of _temperament_. He invented\r\nthe press for copying letters; he introduced the process of bleaching by\r\nthe aid of chlorine; he explained the composition of water, and the art\r\nof warming by steam. The extent, variety, and accuracy of Watt’s\r\nknowledge were amazing. No subject seemed foreign to him, and upon every\r\nsubject he spoke as if that alone had all his life engaged his\r\nattention. Sir Humphrey Davy declared that Watt stood upon a higher\r\nelevation than Archimedes. Great as were his powers, he was a man of\r\nchild-like candour, and of the greatest simplicity.\r\n\r\n  [By Flaxman.]\r\n\r\n429.

Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nA strong and shrewd intellect: determined by native impulse and aptness\r\nto the metaphysical speculations, which, in the country where he was\r\nborn, make regularly an important part of a liberal education. He sought\r\nand maintained the character of a dispassionate inquirer, reading\r\nextensively and carefully weighing conflicting opinions. More a student\r\nthan a man of action; yet, even in study, his energies clogged by a\r\nnatural indolence. Mackintosh, though descended from Jacobites, was a\r\nWhig. In 1791, he wrote a defence of the French Revolution, in answer to\r\nBurke; but, in less than four years, confessed that bitter experience\r\nhad overthrown his generous argument. Adopting the law as a profession,\r\nhe received promotion in India at the hands of his political allies.\r\nAfter seven years’ service, entered Parliament. He wrote an admirable\r\n“Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy” for the\r\n“Encyclopædia Britannica,” and he was engaged on a “History of the\r\nRevolution of 1688,” when he died. A man of great learning,\r\nphilosophical clearness, and fine perception. Yet his works lack method\r\nand elegance, and fail, from the absence of these qualities, to do\r\njustice to the intellect that fashioned them.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore. Executed in 1829 for Lord Nugent.]\r\n\r\n430. FRANCIS JEFFREY. _Critic and Essayist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Edinburgh, 1773. Died, 1850. Aged 77.]\r\n\r\nOne of the founders, and for many years the editor, of the “Edinburgh\r\nReview,”--a publication which he enriched by his essays on poetry and\r\ngeneral literature. He had an acute, ingenious, and spirited intellect,\r\na sensibility of taste, and a constant flow and vivacity of style; but\r\nhis apprehensions in literature and the arts, were rather trained and\r\nauthorized than free and original. He had a leaning, scarcely a special\r\ngift, to speculate on the questions of the Mind--questions early and\r\nfamiliarly brought before him, as rife in the Scottish school in which\r\nhe was educated. The influence of Jeffrey upon literature and public\r\nopinion, during his life-time, was very great--partly from the character\r\nof the Review which he governed, partly from the independence,\r\nbrilliancy, and ability with which he maintained his principles of\r\ntaste. Many of his criticisms contain the soundest views, and are\r\neloquently written: others have been signally refuted by time and the\r\npublic verdict; and their style is defaced by wanton and unjustifiable\r\nflippancy of language. Jeffrey studied for the law, and, being always a\r\nliberal in politics, was promoted by his Whig friends to the Scottish\r\nbench. With the reputation of a brilliant and ingeniously argumentative\r\nspeaker, he disappointed, in the House of Commons, the general\r\nexpectation. He was esteemed a very kind and friendly feeling man.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore. Executed in 1846.]\r\n\r\n431. FRANCIS BAILY. _Astronomer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Newbury, 1774. Died 1844. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nOriginally a stockbroker. One of the founders of the Astronomical\r\nSociety, and for many years its President. Also Fellow and\r\nVice-President of the Royal Society. Author of many astronomical works;\r\namongst others, of a volume detailing the repetition of the Cavendish\r\nexperiment for the determination of the earth’s density.\r\n\r\n  [Executed in marble, by E. H. Daily, R.A. Posthumous. 1848.]\r\n\r\n432. WILLIAM YARRELL. _Naturalist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1784. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe author of “A History of British Birds,” and of various papers on\r\nsubjects connected with natural history. Is treasurer to the Linnæan\r\nSociety of London.\r\n\r\n  [By Henry Weigall.]\r\n\r\n433. GEORGE STEPHENSON. _Engineer._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1781. Died 1848. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nA sturdy plant of English growth. A working mind born ripe for its time.\r\nAn uncultivated power endowed with immeasurable capability. The story of\r\nGeorge Stephenson reads well for his country, well for himself, well for\r\nthe high faculties which Providence has given to man, irrespectively of\r\nbirth, station, education, or any accidental condition. His parentage\r\nwas of the poorest. He could not have begun his race at a more distant\r\npoint from the goal of fortune. He did not even start with his fellows\r\nin open day, under the bright sun, on the earth’s surface. He was a\r\npit-engine boy, and his pay was twopence a day. It was a great rise for\r\nhim when he was made stoker, and he was on the high road to prosperity\r\nwhen he found himself breaksman. Promoted to the office of engineman, he\r\ndeclared that he was “now a man for life.” He first made known his\r\nmechanical genius in the service of Lord Ravensworth, when he repaired\r\nand improved, as an amateur, a condensing pump-engine, which had baffled\r\nthe skill of some professional engineers. Having been, for a time,\r\noccupied in laying down some unimportant lines of rail, he went to\r\nLiverpool to plan a line of railway between that city and Manchester. He\r\nheld out great inducements to enterprize, and made unheard-of prophecies\r\nof success. He even undertook that a locomotive should accomplish ten\r\nmiles of distance in every hour. We must not be surprised that the\r\npeople called him “mad” for proffering the assurance. Similar madmen had\r\npreceded him,--Columbus, Galileo,--the inventor of gas, the discoverer\r\nof vaccination and others. The line, as we know, was made,--the\r\nexperiment tried. Stephenson was right, a locomotive can travel at the\r\nrate of ten miles an hour. The rise of Stephenson was now rapid as the\r\nstrides of his own locomotives. He took the lead at once in railway\r\nengineering; became a great locomotive manufacturer, an extensive\r\nrailway contractor, a large owner of collieries and iron-works, and a\r\nman of mark in the nation. Our railway system is the result of the\r\nmultiform operations of his strong practical mind. Stephenson disputed\r\nwith Sir Humphry Davy the invention of the safety lamp. Other claimants\r\nare in the field. We shall never know the discoverer, any more than we\r\nshall learn the birth-place of Homer; and George Stephenson may spare\r\nthe extra laurel from his iron crown.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore, 1831. Executed for Robert Stephenson, Esq.]\r\n\r\n434. WILLIAM FAIRBAIRN. _Millwright and Engineer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Kelso, on the Tweed, 1789. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThis eminent engineer settled as a millwright in Manchester, in 1815,\r\nand distinguished himself at once by his practical improvements in the\r\nconstruction of mills and workshops. To his early efforts, in the\r\nscience of mill architecture, may be traced much of the improved taste\r\nnow displayed by mill-owners in the manufacturing districts. His latest\r\nachievement in this direction is the magnificent structure at Saltaire,\r\nnear Bradford, Yorkshire. He was an early builder of iron ships in\r\nManchester, Hull, and London. His experiments, designs, and\r\nsuperintendence, were available in the construction of the Conway and\r\nBritannia Tubular Bridges. Mr. Fairbairn, besides his title to respect\r\nas a mechanical engineer, and a great improver in the specific sciences\r\nto which he has devoted his life, is a contributor of much valuable\r\nknowledge through the medium of the press. He is the architect of his\r\nown fortunes, and is remarkable, in an age of remarkable engineers, for\r\nhis great energy, skill, taste, and discrimination.\r\n\r\n  [By J. E. Jones.]\r\n\r\n435. SIR JOHN HERSCHELL. _Astronomer._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1790. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe worthy son of a celebrated sire. Educated at Cambridge, where he\r\neasily distanced all who competed with him for the honours of that seat\r\nof learning. Like his father, Sir John has devoted himself mainly to\r\nastronomical pursuits; but he has penetrated with ardour into every\r\nfield of science, and illuminated by his genius all the ground he has\r\ntrodden. He is a consummate mathematician, an accomplished chemist, a\r\nprofound philosopher, a master of his native language, and of style. In\r\n1834, he proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope, for the purpose of making\r\nobservations in the southern celestial hemisphere, and continued there\r\nfor the space of four years. His “Preliminary Discourse on the Study of\r\nNatural Philosophy,” is amongst the most beautiful, eloquent, and useful\r\nof modern publications. His treatises on Sound and Light show a profound\r\napplication of the highest order of mathematics to physical subjects of\r\nthe most subtle, delicate and ethereal character. Herschell, more than\r\nany other man of this day, has contributed to uphold and increase\r\nEngland’s scientific renown; his learning and accomplishments are\r\nuniversal, and his constant zeal in the diffusion of knowledge amongst\r\nall classes,--amongst the very humblest as well as the very\r\nhighest,--constitutes a right to our gratitude and respect equal to that\r\nestablished by his philosophic labours and infinite acquirements. Sir\r\nJohn Herschell is Master of the Mint. Sir Isaac Newton held the post\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by E. H. Baily, R.A. 1848.]\r\n\r\n436. MICHAEL FARADAY. _Natural Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1794. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThis illustrious scientific man is the son of a poor blacksmith, and was\r\nin early life apprenticed to a bookbinder, at which craft he worked\r\nuntil his twenty-second year. His great delight in electrical researches\r\nbrought him into acquaintance with Sir Humphrey Davy, whose assistant he\r\nbecame in the laboratory of the Royal Institution, where Faraday himself\r\nin time rose to the dignity of Fullerian Professor. The discoveries of\r\nFaraday in several branches of science have placed him in the very\r\nhighest rank amongst European philosophers. The most difficult and\r\nabstruse points in connexion with light, heat, electricity, magnetism,\r\nand the laws of matter, have been simplified to an extraordinary degree\r\nby the force of his sagacity and singular acuteness. As remarkable as\r\nhis genius for discovery, and for the detection of the hidden operations\r\nof nature, is his admirable faculty of exposition. No living man\r\napproaches Faraday in the easy power of communicating the results of the\r\nmost subtle investigation to a miscellaneous audience. Passing through\r\nhis lucid understanding, every subject, however abstruse or abstract,\r\nbecomes simple, clear, and attractive.\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A. Executed in 1823.]\r\n\r\n436*. MARY SOMERVILLE. _Mathematician and Astronomer._\r\n\r\n  [Still living.]\r\n\r\nOne of the few women who step out from the limits which seem naturally\r\nassigned to their intellectual avocations, to compete with men in\r\ntheirs. One of the fewer who do so, deserting none of their proper\r\ntasks, forfeiting nothing of their proper character. A profound\r\nmathematician and astronomer; a delicate inquirer into natural\r\nphenomena. Her work on “The Connexion of the Physical Sciences” spreads\r\nout, in a form designed for the uninitiated reader, but not for the\r\ninattentive, a large variety of impressive knowledge, on some of the\r\nmost interesting laws of the natural world. Her manner of writing is\r\nremarkably simple, descriptive, clear and exact.\r\n\r\n  [By Macdonald. Executed in Rome, 1848.]\r\n\r\n437. WILLIAM WHEWELL. _Philosopher._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Lancaster, 1795. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and at this moment the\r\ngreatest ornament of that celebrated university. He has been tutor in\r\nthe college of which he is the Head, and Professor of Mineralogy.\r\nSubsequently appointed to the Chair of Moral Philosophy, which he still\r\noccupies. A great promoter of the study of this branch of human\r\nlearning, both by his writings and his oral lectures. Has contributed\r\nvaluable essays on the subject of education, with especial reference to\r\nthe studies of his own university. Has enriched mathematical and\r\nphysical science with many original investigations; is the author of a\r\ngreat work on the History and Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, and\r\nof many scientific treatises exhibiting the application of the higher\r\nmathematics to natural philosophy. The vigour, activity, vivacity, and\r\nquickness of his intellect is extraordinary: his memory, in relation to\r\nalmost every branch of literature and science, is rich to overflowing,\r\nand his faculty of conversation brilliant. The mind of William Whewell,\r\nby natural, impetuous action, invades all territories of knowledge, and\r\ngrasps at a dominion forbidden by the term allotted to human life: but\r\nthat mind, clearly and beyond all doubt, has power to grapple and to\r\ndeal effectually with all that it has time to apprehend and seize. It is\r\nnot to be wondered, that the temper of so ardent a spirit should be\r\nhasty: that its nature is frank, generous, and noble.\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A. 1850.]\r\n\r\n438. SIR HENRY THOMAS DE LA BECHE. _Geologist._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1796. Still living.]\r\n\r\nDistinguished himself early by his geological researches in England,\r\nFrance, Italy, and the West Indies. In 1835, the government instituted,\r\nat his suggestion, a Geological Survey of Great Britain, in conjunction\r\nwith, the Ordnance Survey, and subsequently extended it to the United\r\nKingdom, with Sir Henry as Director General. This post he now holds, in\r\nconjunction with the direction of the Museum of Practical Geology, and\r\nof the Government School of Mines. The author of many highly esteemed\r\nworks and memoirs on geology; and has rendered good service to the\r\nstate, by directing his knowledge to practical and educational purposes,\r\nand by inducing politicians, seldom ready to advance in a scientific\r\ndirection, to found institutions of a high intellectual type.\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A. 1845. From the bronze deposited in the Museum of\r\n  Economic Geology, London.]\r\n\r\n439. THOMAS CARLYLE. _Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, 1796. Still living.]\r\n\r\nCritic, Philosopher, Essayist, Censor: the criticism acute,\r\npenetrating,, severe; the philosophy idol-worship; the essay-writing\r\npicturesque, striking, animated, and strongly coloured; the censorship\r\nfurious, testy, useless, if not unmeaning. Saturated with German\r\nmetaphysics, full of German literature, and delighting in the German\r\nform of expression. If Thomas Carlyle would throw off his foreign\r\naffectations, and forget _himself_ in his labours, he would be one of\r\nour most instructive, useful, convincing, and admirable writers; for his\r\nheart is large, his intellect strong, and both heart and intellect have\r\nlong striven to inculcate human love amongst men, and to build, upon\r\nmutual affection, high deeds, and benevolent aspirations. But Thomas\r\nCarlyle, pen in hand, never did forget himself at any one instant of his\r\nlife, and never will. To use one of his own Germanisms, he is the very\r\nincarnation of “Ich.” An instructed author will hold the balance fairly\r\nbetween his subject and his reader, dealing with each with intelligent\r\nreference to the other. Carlyle usually cares nothing either for his\r\nreader or his subject, but swallows up both. Whatever he shows us, we\r\nchiefly see Thomas Carlyle. “The French Revolution” is the best of his\r\nworks! His pictures, there are startling, wonderful, and highly painted;\r\nhis eloquence is inspiriting, and his imagery grand. As a social and\r\nmoral Reformer, he beats the air, belonging to that humblest order of\r\narchitects who are clever enough at destroying houses, but have no power\r\nto set up others in their place. Yet the influence of Carlyle has been\r\ngreat, both in England and America. He has forced men to think--he has\r\nappealed with irresistible power to their better natures--given vigour\r\nand direction to their impulses, and torn the veil from quackery as\r\noften as the evil thing has crossed his manly and indignant path. Sad\r\nthought that so serviceable an arm should be clogged with fetters of its\r\nown forging--that an almost boundless capacity for good should be\r\nrestricted by a tether of its own fashioning.\r\n\r\n  [By H. Weigall.]\r\n\r\n440. FREDERICK CARPENTER SKEY. _Surgeon._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Upton-on-Severn, 1798. Still living.]\r\n\r\nProfessor of Surgery to the Royal College of Surgeons of England:\r\nSurgeon to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and other institutions. The author\r\nof a work on “Operative Surgery,” in which a strong and humane plea is\r\nput forward against the use of the knife until the last extremity; and\r\nof the Hunterian Oration for 1850.\r\n\r\n441. RICHARD OWEN. _Naturalist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Lancaster, 1804. Still living.]\r\n\r\nOwen, Faraday, and Herschell are England’s living representatives of\r\nscience, and are so esteemed throughout Europe. Comparative anatomy,\r\nfounded by Cuvier, has been perfected by Owen, and to him is due the\r\ngreat merit of raising that science in England to a position that\r\ncommands the gratitude and admiration of the whole scientific world.\r\nThis illustrious philosopher commenced life as a midshipman, but his\r\ncareer was quickly arrested by the close of the American war in 1813. In\r\norder to re-enter the profession, he adopted the medical profession, and\r\nbecame the pupil of Mr. Baxendale, a surgeon in Lancaster. In 1824, he\r\nmatriculated in Edinburgh. In 1825, he came to London, and passed the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons in 1826. Under the advice of his friend,\r\nAbernethy, Owen gave up all thoughts of the navy, and accepted an\r\nappointment at the College of Surgeons, where for ten years he laboured\r\nat completing the catalogue of John Hunter’s magnificent museum. The\r\nenormous labour was achieved in 1840. Since that time every form of\r\nanimal life, from the Sponge to the Man, has been submitted to his\r\nsagacious mind, and upon every subject he has thrown illumination. The\r\nmere enumeration of his contributions to the literature of natural\r\nhistory would in itself be a task. His “Treatise on the Homologies of\r\nthe Vertebral Skeleton” has been received with great favour by\r\nanatomists and physiologists. His histories of “British Fossil Mammals\r\nand Birds,” and of “Fossil Reptiles,” the treatise “On the Nature of\r\nLimbs,” on “Parthenogenesis, or the successive production of procreative\r\nindividuals from a single ovum,” have each brought fresh laurels to his\r\nbrow. Cuvier asked, “Why should not natural history one day have its\r\nNewton?” We answer, “It has found Richard Owen.”\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A. 1840.]\r\n\r\n442. BENJAMIN DISRAELI. _Writer and Politician._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1805. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe author, at an early age, of “Vivian Grey,” a novel. Has since\r\npublished many interesting works of the same kind, the most popular\r\nbeing “Coningsby,” a book in which the political views of the writer are\r\ninterwoven in the tale of fiction. Mr. Disraeli has acquired greater\r\nfame as a politician than as an author. By his own efforts, and by the\r\nforce of his great genius, he has risen to one of the highest offices of\r\nstate, having for a few months served his country as Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. Mr. Disraeli is unequalled in the House of Commons for\r\nsarcasm and invective; but he has other, better, more useful, and more\r\nlasting qualities of a statesman. If the moral weight of Mr. Disraeli in\r\nthe country, is less than his talents would seem to claim, public\r\nopinion is not so much to blame as Mr. Disraeli, for the discrepancy\r\nbetween his acknowledged ability, and his place in the world’s\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n443. THOMAS BRASSEY. _Railway Contractor._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Buerton, near Chester, 1805. Still living.]\r\n\r\nOne of the chiefs of the aristocracy that has risen in these latest\r\ntimes upon the foundations of commercial enterprise. A prince of the\r\nnew dynasty, whose dominion extends wherever civilization is fostered by\r\nthe Rail, and whose coronet is of iron. He commenced life as a surveyor\r\nat Birkenhead, and his first connexion with a railway was a contract to\r\nsupply the stone for a viaduct of the “Manchester and Liverpool.” Since\r\nthat time his labours have been incessant and extraordinary, both in his\r\nown country and out of it. Since 1846, he has, upon his own\r\nresponsibility and credit, constructed upwards of 500 miles of railway,\r\nrepresenting an aggregate of £9,250,000 of contract money. In France and\r\nSpain, his joint contracts with Mr. Mackenzie were for 189 English miles\r\nof road, and for nearly £3,000,000 sterling. His engagements, in\r\nScotland and England, with Mr. Mackenzie and Mr. John Stephenson, from\r\n1844 to 1851, comprised 511 miles of railway, and an aggregate of\r\n£7,200,000. His hands are still full, and his men are carrying out his\r\nbehests in all parts of the world. In more senses than one the career of\r\nThomas Brassey may be described as princely. The “Barentin” viaduct, of\r\n27 arches, on the “Rouen and Havre” line tumbled down when all but\r\ncompleted; and the casualty involved a loss of £30,000. Mr. Brassey the\r\ncontractor was neither morally nor legally responsible. He had\r\nrepeatedly protested against the material used in the structure, and the\r\nFrench lawyers maintained that his protest freed him from liability. The\r\ncontractor was of a different opinion. He had contracted, he said, to\r\nmake and maintain the road, and no law should prevent him from being as\r\ngood as his word. The viaduct was rebuilt at Mr. Brassey’s cost. For the\r\nconstruction of this stupendous work (accomplished in seven months)\r\n16,000,000 bricks were required, of which 14,000,000 were new, and made\r\non the spot. Thomas Brassey is beloved by his countless retainers.\r\nRiches, power, influence, and dominion, have not touched his sound and\r\nfeeling heart. We dare to speak truth of this living worthy, for his\r\nlife is in all respects one of the highest examples we can offer to our\r\ngeneration, absorbed as we are in the production of great industrial\r\nundertakings, and, above all things, intent upon the pursuit of wealth.\r\n\r\n  [By J. E. Jones.]\r\n\r\n443*. WILLIAM DARGAN. _Railway Contractor._\r\n\r\n  [Still living.]\r\n\r\nBorn at the beginning of the present century, of humble parents, in the\r\ncounty of Carlow, Ireland. After leaving school, was placed in a\r\nsurveyor’s office. Then served with Telford the engineer, on the\r\nHolyhead-road; afterwards engaged, on his own account, in forming the\r\nHowth Road, and some canal works in other parts of Ireland. Since the\r\nintroduction of railways he has been the chief maker of the iron paths\r\nthat traverse the sister kingdom. When all the works shall be completed,\r\nwhich owe their construction to his skill, ingenuity, and industry,\r\nnearly a thousand miles of railway will be due to his enterprise.\r\nWilliam Dargan is not only a railway contractor, but a railway owner, a\r\nsteam-packet proprietor, a flax grower, and a farmer. Whilst too many of\r\nhis fellow-countrymen have been engaged in destroying--as far as in them\r\nlay--the elements of industry in Ireland, he has laboured to develop her\r\nresources, and to rouse the physical energy and the self-respect of all\r\nclasses. He is a patriot, not a partizan--not an Orangeman, nor a\r\nRibbandman, nor a Repealer, nor a Protestant-ascendancy-man, but a\r\ntrue-hearted Irishman, a useful citizen, a loyal subject. If Sir Robert\r\nPeel could have counted a dozen Dargans amongst his coadjutors in\r\nIreland, he would never have had cause to reckon the government of that\r\nportion of the United Kingdom, amongst his insuperable “difficulties.”\r\nThe greatest work of the patriotic Dargan remains to be mentioned. He\r\nplaced £20,000 at the disposal of the Committee formed in Dublin, for\r\nthe construction of a Crystal Palace in that city. Before the Palace was\r\nready to receive the contributions of all nations, William Dargan had\r\ncontributed a much larger sum. He has his reward in the affectionate\r\ngratitude of the Irish people--in the approving smiles of his\r\nsovereign--in the lasting good wrought by his act in the land of his\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\n  [This statue, by J. E. Jones, is at the south end of the nave.]\r\n\r\n444. SAMUEL WARREN. _Lawyer and Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Denbighshire, 1807. Still living.]\r\n\r\nIs the author of “The Diary of a Physician,” and “Ten Thousand a-Year,”\r\nin the department of fiction, and of a work on the Study of the Law. Mr.\r\nWarren was originally educated for medicine. He has risen to the rank of\r\nQueen’s Counsel in the profession which he subsequently adopted; and his\r\nwritings have acquired a wide popularity. The genius of Mr. Warren lies\r\nespecially in the detection and dissection of character, in which he\r\nexhibits great skill and power.\r\n\r\n  [By Henry Weigall.]\r\n\r\n445. EDWARD SHEPHERD CREASY. _Historical Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Kent, 1812.

JUDGE HALIBURTON. _Lawyer and Writer._\r\n\r\n  [Still living.]\r\n\r\nOff the bench, better known under his assumed name of “Sam Slick.” He is\r\na judge of Nova Scotia. In 1835, first appeared in a Canada paper as the\r\nauthor of a series of letters, illustrating the Yankee character. In\r\n1842, was Attaché in England to the American Legation; one result of\r\nthis appointment was the publication of “Sam Slick in England.” Sam’s\r\npen continues from time to time to enliven and amuse the world, and to\r\nset it broadly grinning. He has infinite humour, a rollicking, racy,\r\nuncontrolled style, an exuberance of animal spirits, great acuteness,\r\nmuch worldly sagacity, and marvellous good sense under all his fun. A\r\ngenial satirist, and one of those who have the best succeeded in making\r\nthe low, corrupted, half-provincial, and half-slang language of an\r\ninferior social class serve literary use.\r\n\r\n  [By J. E. Jones.]\r\n\r\n447. EDWARD FORBES. _Naturalist._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Douglas, Isle of Man, 1815. Still living.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most eminent of our scientific men, remarkable for his\r\noriginality, sagacity, lucid research, and general scientific\r\nattainments. Studied at Edinburgh, and afterwards lectured there on\r\nNatural History. Joined, in 1841, the Hydrographical Survey of the\r\nÆgean, under Captain Graves, R.N., and made important discoveries\r\nrespecting the laws of bathymetrical distribution of marine animals and\r\nplants. In 1842, explored the antiquities, geology, and natural history\r\nof Lycia. During this expedition the sites of eighteen ancient cities\r\nwere brought to light. In 1845, appointed Naturalist to the Geological\r\nSurvey of the United Kingdom, and in 1851, a Professor of the Government\r\nSchool of Mines. President of the Geological Society, one of the Royal\r\nCommissioners of the Great Exhibition, and author of numerous works and\r\nmemoirs on geological, zoological, and botanical subjects. In 1854, upon\r\nthe decease of Professor Jameson, raised to the Chair of Natural History\r\nin the University of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  [By E. H. Baily, R.A.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS AND STATESMEN.\r\n\r\n448. WILLIAM MURRAY, EARL OF MANSFIELD. _Lord Chief Justice._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Perth, in Scotland, 1704. Died in 1793. Aged 88.]\r\n\r\nThis great lawyer and upright man was the fourth son of David, Lord\r\nStormont. In 1718, being thirteen years old, he travelled to London on\r\nthe back of a pony, and went to Westminster school. In 1723, he\r\nproceeded to Oxford. At both places of learning he was distinguished for\r\nhis industry and classical attainments. Afterwards entered at Lincoln’s\r\nInn, and in 1730 was called to the bar. He gradually made his way\r\nupward. In 1742, Solicitor General; 1744, Chief Justice of the King’s\r\nBench; 1776, advanced to the dignity of an Earl. Other events are worthy\r\nof record. During the Gordon Riots of 1780, the Protestant mob, thinking\r\nhim favourable to the Catholics, burned his house to the ground, and\r\ncruelly destroyed a valuable collection of books and manuscripts. He was\r\nthe principal victim of the merciless assaults of Junius; and he is\r\nremembered in the law books, as the chief justice who, in the celebrated\r\ncase of “Rex _v._ Almon,” arising out of one of Junius’s Philippics,\r\nattempted in vain to withdraw the cognisance of the question of libel\r\nfrom the jury, to vest it in the court. In politics Lord Mansfield was a\r\nTory; as a judge he recognised nothing but his duty to his sovereign and\r\nhis country; and he must always be regarded as one of the greatest men\r\nthat have adorned the judgment-seat in England. He possessed an amazing\r\nclearness of apprehension, vast learning, and marvellous perspicuity of\r\nexposition. His love of justice was the sole passion that absorbed his\r\notherwise calm nature, and his integrity was spotless. In law, as in\r\nreligion, the mind of Mansfield was essentially liberal. It was a saying\r\nof Burke’s that Murray--superior to the technicalities of his\r\nprofession--still made the liberality of law keep pace with the demands\r\nof justice and the actual concerns of the world, conforming our\r\njurisprudence to the growth of our commerce and of our empire. He was\r\nthus the founder of the commercial law of England, which before his time\r\nhad no existence. Brave as a lion on the bench, Mansfield exhibited\r\nunaccountable timidity as a statesman. He quailed before Lord Chatham,\r\nwhose schoolfellow he had been, and who mercilessly opposed him from the\r\nschool to the grave. The illustrious rivals now lie quietly side by side\r\nin Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n  [From the statue in Westminster Abbey. Executed in 1801 by Flaxman.]\r\n\r\n449. WILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1708. Died at Hayes, in Kent, 1778. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nA grand Minister, an idol in the memory of the nation, but failing in\r\nsome of the elements of true greatness, for he was haughty, overbearing,\r\ninconsistent, insolent, obstinate, and petty. The statesman who would\r\nnever be seen on business, except in a full dress coat and tie wig--who\r\nnever allowed the highest considerations to interfere with his constant\r\nstudy of effect--who, in opposition, anathematized men for attempting\r\nthat which he himself, in power, was the very first to carry out--who\r\nnever suffered his under secretaries to sit in his presence--who never\r\nblushed at the most barefaced and vehement self-contradiction, can\r\nhardly be ranked with the very highest characters that adorn the pages\r\nof History. Yet he was superb withal, and potent in his influence upon\r\nthe age in which he lived. He had tremendous earnestness; his thoughts\r\nblazed in his mind, and were communicated in burning words to his\r\nlisteners. He had the faculty of uttering great truths, in language that\r\ncarried not only conviction to every understanding, but enthusiasm to\r\nevery soul. He had a noble person--an eye like an eagle’s--a voice of\r\nthunder. His oratory was splendid, and his speeches maintained some of\r\ntheir power when transferred to paper. He was always terrific. He began\r\nhis career as a Cornet in the Blues, and entering Parliament as member\r\nfor Old Sarum, in 1735, he so astonished Sir Robert Walpole by the\r\nviolence of his assault, that the astute Minister was fain to intreat\r\nsome one “to muzzle that terrible Cornet of horse.” The great glory of\r\nChatham, as Minister, consists in the war policy which he advocated and\r\nupheld to the great advantage and pre-eminence of his country. In spite\r\nof all his errors he was adored by the people. He could feel and act\r\nwith true nobility, and the multitude were touched by the lofty\r\nsentiments by which he was himself animated. Almost his whole fortune\r\nconsisted of private benefactions. The Duchess of Marlborough left him\r\n£10,000, and Sir William Pynsent bequeathed him £3000 a year, and\r\n£30,000 in ready money. He opposed the war with America, but with his\r\nlatest breath denied the right of the colony to independence. Whatever\r\nhe did, he was still the most popular man in England. Proud and\r\ndomineering as he was in public, his private character, as Lord\r\nChesterfield declared, “was stained by no vices, and sullied by no\r\nmeannesses.” In his own household, by his children and dependents, he\r\nwas beloved for his gentle kindness. The statue before the visitor is\r\nhighly characteristic of the man. “Graven by a cunning hand,” says\r\nMacaulay, “it seems still with eager face and outstretched arm, to bid\r\nEngland be of good cheer, and to hurl defiance at her foes.”\r\n\r\n  [The original model of the statue by J. Bacon, R.A., in Westminster\r\n  Abbey. It will be found at the South end of the Nave.]\r\n\r\n450. EDMUND BURKE. _Orator, Writer, Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Dublin, 1730. Died 1797. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nColeridge, speaking of Edmund Burke, has said that “he referred\r\nhabitually to principles--he was a scientific statesman.” He is by far\r\nthe most philosophic politician that ever dealt with public affairs in\r\nEngland. He takes rank with those who have applied their genius to the\r\ntransactions of their own fleeting day, in order to extract from them\r\ntruth, wisdom, and instruction for all ages. Gifted with gorgeous\r\neloquence, he spake like a prophet. We read his words, which we are told\r\nfell as he uttered them upon dull insensate ears, and are astounded to\r\nfind how nearly, under altered circumstances, they concern ourselves.\r\nOur descendants shall peruse the same syllables with the same living\r\ninterest, desire, and benefit. Châteaubriand has asserted that when Fox\r\nspoke in the House of Commons, he and all strangers could not keep back\r\ntheir tears. When Burke rose, the act was a signal for general flight.\r\nWe can understand the difference. Burke walked sublimely in advance of\r\nhis contemporaries; Fox was abreast of them, sharing in their\r\nprejudices, and, it may be, inflaming their passions. Burke had great\r\nknowledge of men and books, an imagination rich to overflowing, and\r\nalthough a philosopher and a theorist, business-like habits. His genius\r\nwas unmatched in the House of Commons, and his industry did not fall\r\nshort of that of the most plodding member of that assembly. He was the\r\nson of a Dublin attorney, and in early life found favour with Lord\r\nRockingham, who, bringing him into Parliament, allied him to the Whig\r\ninterest. The connexion was subsequently broken off, when. Burke, in\r\nalarm at the frightful results and portents of the French Revolution,\r\nstrove to preserve Liberty by holding her back from the too ardent\r\nembrace of her professed friends. His “Reflections on the French\r\nRevolution” was the most memorable treatise of the time; and it was\r\nfollowed by others as remarkable for splendid diction, as for the\r\nprofoundest philosophical thought. When starting into life, Burke wrote\r\nhis celebrated essay on “the Sublime and Beautiful,” and set on foot the\r\n“Annual Register,” the historical portion of which he wrote for many\r\nyears. He would have been raised to the peerage but for the premature\r\ndeath of his only son, of whom he was very fond. His character has been\r\nvariously estimated. There is no reason to doubt that he was as\r\nconscientious, as honest, and as sincere, as he was mighty in his high\r\nmental endowments.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore, 1850.]\r\n\r\n451. GEORGE WASHINGTON. _First President of the United States._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Virginia, United States, 1732. Died, 1799. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nIf we were asked to single out from ancient or modern story one bright\r\nunsullied example of true greatness, of perfect patriotism,\r\ndisinterestedness, consistency, and self-devotion, it would be difficult\r\nnot to select George Washington. England, that suffered by his acts, has\r\nreason to be proud of his surpassing glory; for he came from the common\r\nstock, and he wrought the liberty of his country by the exercise of\r\nvirtues dear to all Englishmen, and--let us dare to say--characteristic\r\nof their race. He received the most ordinary education, for he lost his\r\nfather when ten years old; and he had to make his way in life by his own\r\nbest efforts. At the age of eighteen he was appointed surveyor, in\r\nVirginia, to Lord Fairfax. At twenty he was Major in the colonial\r\nmilitia. In 1775, he took the command of the army in America against\r\nEngland. How he acted from that hour until 1783, when the treaty of\r\npeace was signed,--what intrepidity he exhibited,--what wisdom, what\r\ncoolness, what courage, what moderation, what rare self-command under\r\ndefeat, for, fighting at great disadvantage, he lost more battles than\r\nhe gained,--is known to all. In 1789, he was elected President of the\r\nUnited States. As chief of the government, he declined all remuneration,\r\nsave the bare payment of his official service: he had shown the same\r\nabstinence when in command of the army. In 1796, worn out by the labours\r\nand anxieties of his momentous life, he laid down his power and withdrew\r\ninto privacy; but not until he had delivered to the American people, as\r\nhis last public work, his solemn advice for their future\r\nself-government and conduct. His words of weight may be read to-day with\r\nsingular advantage by the millions who enjoy the inappreciable blessings\r\nof freedom and prosperity, which his good right hand, sound heart, and\r\nsagacious judgment, chiefly secured to them. If hero-worship may be\r\npardoned, he shall be forgiven--for his offence shall induce in him only\r\nhumility--who kneels before the quiet, unpretending shrine of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n  [By Canova.]\r\n\r\n451*. WARREN HASTINGS. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1732. Died 1818. Aged 86.]\r\n\r\nDescended of an ancient and honoured line, seated at Daylesford, in\r\nWorcestershire, but ruined by taking the King’s side in the civil war.\r\nThe boy, motherless, from his birth, and left in the hands of his\r\ngrandfather, the impoverished incumbent of the parish, was sent early to\r\nthe village school, and taught his letters with the peasantry. At seven\r\nyears old, as he basked on the bank of the little stream that ran\r\nthrough the domain of his fathers, the thought of repossessing the lost\r\ninheritance broke on his imagination. The vision of the child was the\r\nsingle personal aim of the man’s life. What a life, ere the vision took\r\nreality! At 10 he was placed at Westminster school, at 17 he sailed with\r\na writership for Bengal. His courage and intelligence, when the English\r\nauthorities had fled from Calcutta, with his services in Clive’s army,\r\nraised him rapidly to distinction, and in ten years after setting foot\r\non Indian ground, he was member of Council. At 32, he returned, with a\r\nmoderate fortune, to England: and--that given and spent--at 36, back to\r\nIndia. At 40, Governor of Bengal. At 41, Governor-General. Ere the five\r\nyears of his appointment had elapsed, he was more! He had overthrown his\r\nmortal foes in the Council: and was Lord Paramount of British India. In\r\nhis 53rd year, his reign ceased. What had it been? With a resolution\r\nwhich no dangers and no difficulties could daunt, with a genius for\r\nresource, fertile in proportion to the demand, with a sagacity that\r\ndisabled opposition and commanded success, with a self-possession calm\r\nin every tempest, he had taken in hand a set of provinces imperilled by\r\ntheir disorganization and by terrible enemies: and he left a constructed\r\nand fortified empire. What had been his means? Good and ill. He had\r\nstood between the rapacious rulers and the feeble ruled, and was alike\r\nbeloved by both. A civilian, he held the heart and allegiance of the\r\narmy. But in India he had used Indian powers. He had not amassed money\r\ncorruptly, but he had corrupted with it. He had extorted treasure, he\r\nhad broken faith, he had authorized and instigated cruelty, he had\r\nviolated justice to shed guilty blood, he had held the ordinary moral\r\nlaws suspended, for the safety and the aggrandizement of the dominion\r\ncommitted to his sway. Called to answer before the highest tribunal in\r\nthe land, by all the intellect, eloquence, and power of a great party in\r\nParliament, he was acquitted after a process of unheard-of duration,\r\nreaching through many years: but ruined by the costs. Partially\r\ncompensated by the India House he retired to the ancestral home which,\r\naccording to his early resolve, he had taken care to secure. Here for\r\nyears he lived a tranquil, happy life in the midst of books, which he\r\nloved, and of endeavours to improve English cultivation from his\r\nexperience in India.\r\n\r\n  [By J. Bacon, R.A.]\r\n\r\n452. CHARLES JAMES FOX. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1748. Died 1806. Aged 58.]\r\n\r\nThis great orator and popular statesman, like his rival William Pitt,\r\nwas trained from his youth for political life. He was the son of Henry,\r\nfirst Lord Holland, and received his education at Westminster, Eton, and\r\nOxford. His acquaintance with ancient and modern literature was\r\nextensive, his taste highly cultivated, and his literary ability great.\r\nHad he not been a politician, he might have won high distinction as a\r\nscholar; or, had he not been constitutionally indolent, have reflected\r\nlustre upon his public deeds by labours in more classic fields. There\r\nwas a difference of ten years in the ages of Pitt and Fox; Pitt being\r\nthe younger man. Both were second sons: both had been sedulously\r\nprepared for the great arena by their ambitious fathers. Pitt began his\r\nwork as a Reformer, but quickly turned aside into the ranks of the\r\nTories. Fox, starting into life under the wing of his Tory parent, spoke\r\nand voted against Wilkes; but quickly repenting of his act, threw\r\nhimself into the arms of the Whigs. And then the battle between the two\r\nrare combatants was well fought out unto the end--Pitt dying in harness\r\nin 1806, Fox following him the very same year. Fox was a Liberal, as the\r\nname was in his time understood by the great Whig families--an\r\naristocrat with popular ideas, sympathizing with progress, but holding\r\nfast to the pillar of the constitution, every stone of which he\r\njealously upheld. On every great subject he stood opposed to Pitt; he\r\ninveighed bitterly against the war with France, as he had formerly\r\nsteadily opposed the rupture with the American Colonies. He was a\r\nspeaker of extraordinary power; his oratory being bold, argumentative,\r\nimpassioned, and unpremeditated. His followers were attached to his\r\nperson, and in private life he was beloved, for he had an affectionate\r\nand noble nature, clouded by sad weaknesses. He was a desperate\r\ngamester, and a lover of pleasure to excess. At St. Ann’s Hill,\r\nwithdrawn from the heat of conflict and dissipation, to his quiet and\r\nbeloved garden--to his friends and his books, he was more faithful to\r\nhimself, and to the good gifts of Providence within him.\r\n\r\n  [By I. Nollekens, R.A.]\r\n\r\n453. JOHN PHILPOT CURRAN. _Lawyer._\r\n\r\n  [Born near Cork, 1750. Died in London, 1817. Aged 67.]\r\n\r\nOf very humble parentage. Obtaining a sizarship, he received his\r\neducation at Trinity College, Dublin, free of expense. He went to\r\nLondon, and entered himself as student at one of the Inns of Court.\r\nCalled to the bar in 1775. His brilliant qualities soon brought him into\r\nnotice. He was employed to defend various persons charged with political\r\noffences, and his eloquence, his wit, his withering sarcasm, and\r\ntouching pathos, carried all before them. In 1784, he obtained a silk\r\ngown, and took his seat in the Irish House of Commons as member for\r\nDoneraile. When the Whigs came into office in 1806, he was made Master\r\nof the Rolls in Ireland. This office he held until 1814, when he\r\nresigned it and secured a pension of 3000_l._ a-year. He then visited\r\nEngland, and took up his residence in London, where he died. He was a\r\npopular advocate, and a most successful debater. His personal appearance\r\nwas as deficient in grace as his intellectual powers were splendid. His\r\ncountry, which loved him when living, lamented him when dead, and\r\nperpetuated her love and her grief by the erection of a public monument\r\nto his memory.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore. 1841. Executed for his monument in St.\r\n  Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin.]\r\n\r\n454. LORD ELDON. _High Chancellor of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1751. Died 1838. Aged 87.]\r\n\r\nA great lawyer. His legal learning, it is said, has never been\r\nsurpassed, If it has been equalled. For many years of his long life he\r\nsat on the judgment seat, and in the councils of his Sovereign. But the\r\nfame of Eldon as a politician has not survived him. He was narrow-minded\r\nand narrow-hearted. Lord Brougham has summed up his political faith when\r\nhe says, “he was alike the determined enemy of all who would either\r\ninvade the institution, or extirpate the abuse.” He worshipped things as\r\nthey were. Whatever existed--whether a rotten borough, a sanguinary\r\nenactment, or an unjust civil disability--to the mind of Lord Eldon it\r\nformed part of the “British Constitution,” and that Constitution had in\r\nhis eye a sanctity, like religion. No argument was admitted against this\r\niron and immovable belief. Hence, though all men respected his\r\nsincerity, all enlightened men pitied his bigotry, and felt it as a\r\npublic relief when he departed in his ripe old age. He was the last\r\ngreat man of the remorselessly obstructive school to which he belonged.\r\nAs Lord Chancellor, his decisions have obtained great respect, but he\r\nwas generally so long in arriving at them, and hesitation and doubt\r\nformed so marked a characteristic of his judicial character, that the\r\npecuniary losses and human misery for which he became responsible were\r\nconsiderable. Lord Eldon was of humble origin, and his chances of\r\npromotion seemed in early life so remote, that he was actually at the\r\nminute of quitting London in despair when he received the brief that\r\ntook him on to fortune.\r\n\r\n  [By Chantrey.]\r\n\r\n455. HORATIO NELSON. _Lord High Admiral._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Burnham-Thorpe, in Norfolk, 1758. Died at Trafalgar, 1805.\r\n  Aged 47.]\r\n\r\nThe most famous of sea-captains, and the darling of his country. He\r\nfought the sea-half of the world’s greatest war. England has a just\r\npride in her Wellington, whose memory she honours. Towards Nelson she\r\nlooks with a tenderer recollection, and her heart moves when she thinks\r\nof his services and renown. As Captain in 1794, he conducted a siege at\r\nCalvi, and lost an eye. In 1797, crying to his men “Westminster Abbey or\r\nglorious victory,” he captured the San Jose and San Nicolas, at the\r\nbattle of St. Vincent. In the same year he lost his right arm at\r\nTeneriffe, and twelve months afterwards he received a wound in his head\r\nat the glorious victory of the Nile. There was in truth very little left\r\nof the man--yet all of the hero--when, in 1805, a cruel shot at the\r\nbattle of Trafalgar, killed him in the very hour of triumph to his\r\nfleet, of delivery to his country. His death was felt in England as a\r\npersonal, as well as national calamity, and was mourned by the whole\r\npeople as by one man. Gentle as a woman; brave as a lion; devoted to his\r\ncountry; fighting her battles with a passionate ardour that consumed and\r\nobliterated all personal considerations; loyal; pious;--these are some\r\nof the qualities that combined to form the character of Horatio Nelson.\r\nHe was always insignificant in person; and after his slender frame had\r\nbeen battered about by the enemy, his appearance in the honoured uniform\r\nwhich, his services had won, was most singular and striking; for he\r\nlooked like a skeleton clothed in cumbrous magnificence. Yet the\r\ninfluence of this reduced, war-beaten figure was electrical. All who\r\ncame within its atmosphere partook of its own nature. The followers of\r\nNelson could and did achieve miracles, because they had unbounded faith\r\nin the power of their chief--in his heroism, resolution, and\r\ndetermination at all times to win. Nelson was beloved by his sailors. He\r\nlies buried in St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n456. WILLIAM PITT. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Hayes, in Kent, 1759. Died 1806. Aged 47.]\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that the life of William Pitt, the second and\r\nfavourite son of the magnificent Earl of Chatham, had neither springtime\r\nnor autumn. It knew neither the fresh delights of boyhood, nor the\r\ntranquil happiness of age. His father had trained him from his very\r\nchildhood, like an athlete, for the feverish arena of politics. Before\r\nhe was twenty-one, he stood a gladiator armed; and from that age until\r\nhis comparatively early death he knew no rest. He was twenty-four--a\r\nperiod at which our English youth are quitting college, and looking\r\naround them for a profession--when he became Prime Minister of England.\r\nFor seventeen years, in the midst of broil and battle, of discontent at\r\nhome and warfare abroad, this great man held the place which his eagle\r\nambition had chosen for its eyrie on the rock, defying opposition by his\r\ncommanding eloquence, by the fertility and grandeur of his resources, by\r\nhis singular financial ability, and by his unquenchable energy. In 1801,\r\nhe descended from his lofty seat in order to make way for a Minister of\r\npeace; but in 1804, all hope of peace being blasted, he was again\r\nsummoned to direct the councils of the nation, and again he exercised\r\nall his varied powers for the development and consummation of the\r\npolicy, which, right or wrong, he deemed essential to the safety of\r\nEngland, and to the tranquillity and freedom of the world. Two years\r\nafter his return to office, he fell a victim to his life-long labours\r\nand to an hereditary gout, nourished by intemperate habits. It is\r\nsomewhat curious that Pitt, the cherished head of the aristocratic and\r\nTory party, had expressed himself in favour of nearly all the principles\r\nwhich the liberals of subsequent times have struggled, not fruitlessly,\r\nto uphold. He was friendly to Church Reform, to Financial Reform, to\r\nParliamentary Reform, and to the removal of disabilities on account of\r\nreligious belief. He died at the same age as Lord Nelson; and as to Lord\r\nNelson, so to him, a public funeral was decreed. The sum of forty\r\nthousand pounds also was voted to pay his debts. Whatever had been the\r\nfaults of Pitt, he was not avaricious. He had made no money by the\r\nState, for he had ever been the most unostentatious of men. The\r\ncharacter of his eloquence was unlike that of his father. It was\r\nlogical, dignified, equable: now rising into indignant invective, and\r\nnow taking the shape of the keenest and most cutting sarcasm; but always\r\nself-possessed. It did not burst in torrent from an overflowing fount of\r\nwrath and passion like the submerging oratory of Chatham. The form of\r\nPitt was gaunt, his countenance harsh, and his action ungraceful. He\r\nwas, in many respects, one of the greatest Ministers our country has\r\never seen. His rapid comprehension was well described by his tutor, who\r\nsaid that he seemed to him to justify the doctrine of Plato, that the\r\nact of learning is reminiscence only, and not acquisition. He was the\r\nfavourite of the nation: Fox of a party.\r\n\r\n  [By J. Nollekens, R.A.]\r\n\r\n457. GENERAL JACKSON. _President of the United States._\r\n\r\n  [Born in South Carolina, U.S., 1767. Died at Nashville, in Tennessee,\r\n  1845. Aged 78.]\r\n\r\nThe son of an Irish emigrant. He was originally destined for the Church:\r\nbut he quitted school to take part in the War of Independence. The war\r\nover, he adopted the law as a profession, and became judge in Tennessee,\r\nas well as Major-General of the Forces of the same state. In 1815, as\r\nMajor-General of the United States, he gained a decisive victory over\r\nthe English at New Orleans. In 1821, appointed Governor of Florida, and\r\nthe next year elected member of the Senate for the state of Tennessee.\r\nElected President of the United States in 1828 and again 1832; so that\r\nhe was at the head of the American government for the space of eight\r\nyears. An ardent democratic chief throughout life. His presidency was\r\ndistinguished by the development of democratic tendencies, of the spirit\r\nof territorial extension, and by the marked encouragement of the\r\nslave-holding interest. He successfully opposed Congress in the matter\r\nof the United States Bank, regarding it as a monopoly in the State\r\ninjurious to the general interests of the people. Jackson was a man of\r\nRoman virtues, a true patriot, and of uncompromising integrity, simple,\r\nand austere. Straightforward and blunt as a soldier.\r\n\r\n  [By Hiram Powers.]\r\n\r\n458. HENRY WILLIAM PAGET, MARQUIS OF ANGLESEY. _English Field Marshal._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1768. Died 1854. Aged 86.]\r\n\r\nA distinguished, brave, and gallant military commander. In 1793, served\r\nin Flanders. Later, won honour in Spain, especially by the skill with\r\nwhich he covered General Moore’s retreat. At Waterloo, where he\r\ncommanded the whole British cavalry, he lost a leg. He was\r\nmember of the government under Canning, and in 1828--a memorable\r\nepoch--Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Again held this appointment under\r\nLord Grey, in 1831.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore. 1840. Executed for W. H. Curran, Esq.]\r\n\r\n459. ARTHUR, DUKE OF WELLINGTON. _Soldier and Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Ireland, 1769. Died at Walmer Castle, 1852. Aged 83.]\r\n\r\nThe third son of the Earl of Mornington, and of Anna, daughter of\r\nViscount Dungannon. Received his early education at Eton--then studied\r\nat the military school of Angers, in France; and in 1787, entered an\r\ninfantry regiment as Ensign. Later became by purchase Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nof the 33rd, and in that regiment took part in Holland in the campaign\r\nof 1794. His first great military exploit was at the beginning of the\r\ncentury, in India, where his brother was Governor-General, and where,\r\nfighting in the war against the Mahrattas, he annihilated at Assaye an\r\narmy of 60,000 men, with only 12,000 troops. From this period until his\r\ndefeat of the French army, and the overthrow of Napoleon on the field of\r\nWaterloo (1815), his career was a series of triumphs. Many comparisons\r\nhave been made between Napoleon and Wellington; all are unnecessary, and\r\nfrom the purpose. There is no resemblance whatever in the two\r\ncharacters. If it is contended that Napoleon was the greatest military\r\nhero of his time, it is sufficient for the admirers of Wellington to\r\nstate, that after the English captain had beaten, one upon another, the\r\ngreat Marshals of Napoleon, he conquered Buonaparte himself, and put an\r\nend for ever to his splendid authority and terrible misrule. Madame de\r\nStaël has said, speaking of Wellington, that “Never was so great a man\r\nmade out of such small materials.” Another writer has remarked, that in\r\nhim “common sense amounted to genius.” A third tells us that he\r\naccomplished everything by that system of self-subjugation which made\r\nevery wish, desire, aim, and object of life subordinate to a paramount\r\nand an ever-present sense of duty. We may gather a notion of the true\r\ncharacter of Wellington from such criticism. There was nothing brilliant\r\nand overpowering in his genius; but he commanded respect, and won\r\ngreatness by the wisdom of his combinations, the steadiness of his will,\r\nthe simplicity of his aim, and the pertinacity of his course--his mind\r\nbeing once made up as to the direction to be taken. Wellington had\r\nboundless influence over his men, because he had irresistible power over\r\nhimself. He knew better than any other great captain what not to do: and\r\nhaving resolved upon the propriety of inaction, no consideration, no\r\namount of obloquy, blame, or reproach, could incite him into action.\r\nWhen he undertook command in Portugal, it was his conviction that the\r\nenemy were to be finally defeated by a passive policy on his part at\r\nstarting. For months, against general opinion, he persisted in that\r\npolicy; and after it had succeeded beyond all expectation, once a-foot,\r\nhe advanced resolutely with his troops, scoured Portugal and Spain,\r\ndrove the French before him, followed them into France, and never\r\nslackened until he had caught Napoleon, and chained him to the rock of\r\nSt. Helena. Into the field of politics Wellington brought the same\r\npolicy to play. He knew when to act on the defensive, how long he might\r\ndefend with safety, when it was prudent to retreat or capitulate upon\r\nhonourable conditions. The life of Wellington, from his boyhood until\r\nhis death, is an instructive lesson for his countrymen. His daily\r\nhabits, as we all know, were of the simplest; and his business-like\r\nactivity was the most remarkable characteristic of his old age. In\r\nmanners Wellington was soldierly and rough, but he was fond of children.\r\nHe had few intimate male friends, but he has left behind him a\r\ncorrespondence that shows the delight he took in opening his mind\r\nfreely, on the most delicate questions of State policy, to more than one\r\nof the gentler sex. A great contemporary poet, a friend and warm admirer\r\nof Wellington, has said that this illustrious, and in many respects\r\nperfect man, had one infirmity that brought him down to the level of us\r\nall--“he could be angry.”\r\n\r\n  [By Henry Weigall.

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. _President of the United States._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Boston, U.S., 1769, Died 1848. Aged 79.]\r\n\r\nEducated in Europe. At a tender age, private secretary to the American\r\nMinister at St. Petersburgh. In 1794, appointed by Washington,\r\nAmbassador to the Hague. In 1809, Ambassador to the Court of Russia.\r\nSubsequently Ambassador in London. In 1825, President of the United\r\nStates. His administration worthy of his life, which was pure,\r\ndisinterested, and strictly honest. Upon his death in 1848, he left a\r\nreputation for integrity, independence, and manly straightforwardness,\r\nsecond only to that of Washington. His habits to the last simple and\r\nunostentatious, and his industry remarkable. His exterior was cold, but\r\nfire glowed within, for his nature was as earnest as his oratory was\r\nfierce. He had a tenacious memory, great knowledge, and the faculty of\r\nspeaking forcibly, clearly, and to the purpose. One of the worthies of\r\nthe Great Republic.\r\n\r\n  [By Hiram Powers.]\r\n\r\n461. LORD MONTEAGLE. _English Peer._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1790.

WILLIAM HUSKISSON. _Statesman and Financier._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Worcestershire, 1770. Accidentally killed, 1830. Aged 60.]\r\n\r\nA distinguished statesman, whose commercial views, early in the present\r\ncentury, were considerably in advance of those of the political party to\r\nwhich he was attached, and who strongly advocated the principle of the\r\nmeasures carried at a later period by Sir Robert Peel. He served under\r\nPitt, and afterwards was President of the Board of Trade. He was\r\naccidentally killed by a train, at the opening of the Manchester and\r\nLiverpool Railway.\r\n\r\n  [For account of this statue, the original of which is at Liverpool,\r\n  see Handbook of Modern Sculpture, No. 29.]\r\n\r\n463. JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY, BARON LYNDHURST. _Ex-Chancellor of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Boston, U. S., 1772. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe son of a celebrated painter. After having studied at Cambridge,\r\nwhere he took high mathematical honours, he was called to the bar, in\r\n1804. In 1826, Master of the Rolls; in 1827, Lord Chancellor. Has held\r\nthis last high office at three distinct periods of his life. Lord\r\nLyndhurst is remarked for the extraordinary lucidity and quickness of\r\nhis understanding. His mind has the utmost facility in grasping the most\r\nintricate and involved points of any case submitted to it; and his\r\nfacility of exposition is as perfect as his perception is acute. Hence,\r\nthough not the greatest of the lawyers who have dignified the woolsack,\r\nhe has always been the most agreeable and popular of Lord Chancellors.\r\nHe is eloquent without labour, and convincing without vehemence--in many\r\nrespects a master of oratory. In his eighty-third year, his polished\r\nintellect has lost none of its lustre. It has all the vigour, in debate,\r\nwhich it possessed half a century ago. Lord Lyndhurst at first took side\r\nwith the Liberal party in politics, but he soon became a follower of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, and with that Minister he remained to the last.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n464. LORD ASHBURTON. _English Peer._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1774. Died 1848. Aged 74.]\r\n\r\nThe head of the great mercantile house of Baring. As Ambassador to\r\nAmerica during the government of Sir Robert Peel, Lord Ashburton\r\nconcluded the treaty between England and the United States which settled\r\nthe much-vexed “Oregon question.” His marriage with an American lady\r\nattached an interest to his person in America, and his high character\r\ngave him weight and authority at home.\r\n\r\n  [By Macdonald, of Rome.]\r\n\r\n465. DANIEL O’CONNELL. _Orator and Lawyer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Cahir, in Ireland, 1775. Died at Genoa, 1847. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nThe great Irish agitator. A man of extraordinarily powerful talents and\r\ninfluence. His oratory, especially adapted to sway the hearts of an\r\nIrish multitude, obtained for him a rule throughout Ireland that has\r\nnever been equalled. Thousands upon thousands of his fellow-countrymen\r\nwere content to be governed by his will for good or for evil. The\r\nunprecedented opportunity was used by Daniel O’Connell, less for the\r\nadvantage and happiness of his afflicted country, than for his own\r\nselfish ends. When the wrongs of Ireland clamoured loudly for redress,\r\nO’Connell was an agitator with a righteous cause sustaining his great\r\neloquence. When those wrongs were in course of remedy--were remedied--he\r\nwas still an agitator, but unsustained by any cause save that of his own\r\npecuniary necessities. It is lamentable to think how much good might\r\nhave been effected by the energies of O’Connell, and to what deplorable\r\nstraits his policy had reduced Ireland before death took him from it.\r\nHad it been as much to his personal and pecuniary interest to render his\r\ncountry contented, peaceful, prosperous, as to keep her in a ferment of\r\ndiscontent, discord, and semi-rebellion, O’Connell would have proved one\r\nof the greatest benefactors of his kind. As it was, he left behind him a\r\nname, which is not uttered with opprobrium--simply because it is already\r\nnearly forgotten. The associations connected with his memory have\r\nnothing in common with the new epoch of tranquillity, order, and steady\r\nindustry, upon which Ireland has entered. O’Connell was not so eloquent\r\nin the House of Commons as out of it. He was born for the multitude. His\r\npower of invective, his faculty of humour, his facility of illustration,\r\nhis familiar tones, his burly form, his winning voice, were all elements\r\nthat go to make up the successful demagogue.\r\n\r\n  [By J. E. Jones.]\r\n\r\n466. JOSEPH HUME. _Political Reformer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Montrose, 1777. Still living.]\r\n\r\nHas sat in the House of Commons for upwards of forty years. Was educated\r\nfor the medical profession, and is member of the Colleges of Surgeons of\r\nEdinburgh and London. Acted in India as Persian interpreter to the army,\r\nduring the Mahratta war, from 1802 to 1807. Joseph Hume is a consistent\r\nReformer, and by his steadiness, earnestness, and faithful adherence to\r\nthe principles of his life, has secured the respect and good-will of all\r\npolitical parties. When he entered parliament, his views were considered\r\nextreme and theoretical. Many of these views have been gradually adopted\r\nby the leading statesmen of the time, and there is every probability\r\nthat Mr. Hume will outlive all his grievances. He is a rigid economist,\r\nand a thoroughly honest politician.\r\n\r\n467. HENRY, LORD BROUGHAM. _Lawyer, Statesman, Educator._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1779. Still living.]\r\n\r\nA name that will be identified for ever with the advances in\r\ncivilisation made in this country, during the first half of the present\r\ncentury. For the great reforms effected in our criminal law, for the\r\nimpetus which has been given to education among all classes, we are\r\nchiefly indebted to the influence of Lord Brougham, and to the\r\nindomitable exertion of his strong, practical, energetic, and versatile\r\nmind. He has been Lord High Chancellor of England; but his legal\r\nattainments constitute his very smallest title to respect. He is a great\r\norator, a man of science worthy of taking rank with scientific men, a\r\nmetaphysician, an historian, an essayist. He has addressed himself to\r\nevery branch of knowledge, and is distinguished in all. Before he was\r\nelevated to the peerage he was one of the foremost men in England,\r\nhonoured for his resolute and fiery opposition to abuses of every kind,\r\nand beloved for his eager anxiety to remove the shackles from the negro,\r\nand every disability from the limbs of his fellow-creatures nearer home.\r\nSocial elevation has not added to the popularity of Lord Brougham, for\r\nthe ermine has in part withdrawn the idol from the people. All his\r\nmagnificent qualities are depressed and dwarfed beneath his coronet. His\r\neloquence is not so overpowering nor so thrilling, his sympathies for\r\nthe classes below him are apparently deadened, his respect for his\r\n“order” proportionately increased. He has ceased to be “the first man”\r\nout of doors, without becoming the first lord within. If he has not\r\nsurvived his reputation he has manifestly damaged it. Yet for his former\r\npermanent and vital services to his country, his name shall be held by\r\nEnglishmen in lasting, grateful, and affectionate remembrance.\r\n\r\n  [By Deer.]\r\n\r\n467A. HENRY, LORD BROUGHAM. _Lawyer, Statesman, Educator._\r\n\r\n  [An admirable seated portrait statue, by E. G. Papworth, Sen., which\r\n  will be found at the South end of the Nave, Presented by the\r\n  sculptor.]\r\n\r\n468. MARTIN VAN BUREN. _Ex-President of the United States._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1782. Still living.]\r\n\r\nA lawyer, and an active politician in the democratic interest. From 1812\r\nuntil 1820, a member of the United States Senate, during which time a\r\nkeen supporter of the war with England, and, for a short period,\r\nAttorney-General. In 1828, Governor of the State of New York--then\r\nSecretary of State in the cabinet of General Jackson. Vice President in\r\n1832, and during General Jackson’s second term of office. In 1836,\r\nelected President by a large majority. The principal measure of his\r\nadministration was the re-establishment of the independent treasury. In\r\n1840, again nominated for the Presidency, but defeated by General\r\nHarrison, the Whig candidate. Since the close of his presidential term\r\nin 1841, Mr. Van Buren has lived in retirement. His popularity was not\r\nso great at the close as at the beginning of his political life.\r\n\r\n  [By Hiram Powers.]\r\n\r\n469. JOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN. _American Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Abbeville, in South Carolina, U.S. 1782. Died at Washington,\r\n  1850. Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nOf Irish descent. Educated at Yale College, and studied law at\r\nLichfield, in Connecticut. In 1807, admitted to the Bar. In 1811,\r\nelected to Congress. Secretary of War in 1817; and from 1825 to 1832,\r\nVice-President of the United States. He asserted that the American\r\nconstitution was a mere federal treaty, from the conditions of which an\r\nindividual State might at any time withdraw itself, if the inhabitants\r\nof the State so desired. This dangerous principle was combated by\r\nWebster, and--luckily for the Union--with success. Calhoun had great\r\neloquence, and rapid powers of generalisation. He was inflexible in\r\nintegrity, firm of purpose, energetic, laborious, and endowed with a\r\nhigh sense of honour; devoted to his country, with an inextinguishable\r\nlove of liberty. A moderate democrat, nevertheless, and a free-trader.\r\nIn person he was tall and lank; his face indicated great firmness of\r\ncharacter and determination. His manner of speaking and of gesticulation\r\nwas remarkable. He would walk constantly up and down during his\r\ndiscourse, his right arm moving all the while regularly backwards and\r\nforwards, like the pendulum of a clock.\r\n\r\n  [By Hiram Powers.]\r\n\r\n469.* DANIEL WEBSTER. _American Statesman and Orator._\r\n\r\n  [Born, in New Hampshire, U.S., 1782. Died 1852. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nDescended from one of those pilgrim-fathers of New England, who\r\nemigrated, in 1636. A lawyer. In 1813, took his seat in Congress for New\r\nHampshire, war then raging with England. He advocated the war with\r\nfervid eloquence. In politics a “Whig,” a term corresponding to our\r\n“Conservative.” An avowed opponent of the Democratic party, but a still\r\nstronger friend to the true interests of his country, and, like our own\r\nSir Robert Peel, preferring these to a dogged and an injurious\r\npersistance in his own preconceived political views. Hence, though no\r\nfriend to slavery, Webster carried on no bitter crusade against it; and\r\nhence his conciliatory policy which, in dealing with the unhappy\r\ninstitution, maintained, through difficulty and danger, the political\r\nUnion that contributes so largely to the strength and greatness of the\r\nAmerican people. The oratory of Webster was of a high order: the most\r\nclassical that America has yet displayed. It was powerful,\r\nargumentative, and as remarkable for passion, as for logical acumen. He\r\nwas also a scholar, with a refined taste, and deeply attached to the\r\nliterature of the old country. In person he was thick-set and burly. The\r\ncountenance indicated force, without delicacy of taste and perception:\r\nbut in this respect the countenance of Daniel Webster belied his mind.\r\nHis death, at the close of a vehement career, was serene and happy.\r\n\r\n  [By Hiram Powers.]\r\n\r\n470. SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK. _Chief Baron of the Exchequer._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1783. Still living.]\r\n\r\nEducated at Cambridge, where he obtained high mathematical distinction.\r\nHas been Attorney General.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n470.* SIR HENRY POTTINGER. _Diplomatist._\r\n\r\n  [Still living.]\r\n\r\nWent to India as Cadet in 1804, and became Major-General in the East\r\nIndia Company’s service. During his long sojourn in India he fulfilled\r\nmany appointments. In 1841, selected by the Government to proceed to\r\nChina as Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary for the adjustment of\r\nthe differences then existing between the two empires. Amongst his other\r\nrewards for his success in this mission, he received from the House of\r\nCommons a pension of 1500_l._ a-year. Afterwards Governor of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope: now Governor of Madras.\r\n\r\n  [By J. E. Jones.]\r\n\r\n471. HENRY JOHN TEMPLE, VISCOUNT PALMERSTON. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1784. Still living.]\r\n\r\nA Minister under many governments. Secretary-at-War from 1809 until\r\n1828. Foreign Secretary, with a slight interval of repose, from 1830\r\nuntil 1841. Again Foreign Secretary in 1846. At the present moment, Home\r\nSecretary in the administration of Lord Aberdeen. A statesman of vast\r\nknowledge and acquirements; of sterling business habits; quick and\r\ndecided in action. An admirable debater, with a facile, ready, but not\r\nlofty eloquence. The upholder of constitutional government wherever his\r\nname and position have acquired influence in the world. Friendly to\r\nefforts made abroad for the recovery of liberty, he has been held in\r\nterror by those who would still keep liberty in chains. Of all living\r\nMinisters, Lord Palmerston is the most personally popular. He has served\r\nwith many parties, and yet is no party man. The Whigs do not love him;\r\nthe Conservatives cannot claim him; the Radicals own him not. Yet the\r\neye of England glances involuntarily towards him as one with qualities\r\nto be exercised on great occasions, in the interests of his country. We\r\ncannot enumerate his followers; but his admirers are countless. He has\r\nmany practical virtues that constitute a bond, uniting him to\r\nEnglishmen, and make him an object of interest in the national mind. He\r\nis bold, outspoken, courageous, patriotic; genial in temper, and\r\nunaffected in intercourse. He has infinite “pluck.” When he strikes, he\r\nhits straight and effectually. In self-defence his “parry” is\r\ninimitable, and always successful.\r\n\r\n  [Executed in 1846 by Christopher Moore.]\r\n\r\n472. SIR ROBERT PEEL. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born near Bury, in Lancashire, 1788. Died in London, 1850. Aged 62.]\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons was to Peel--what it had been to Pitt, his\r\nillustrious predecessor--his world of thought and action. Pitt was 20\r\nwhen he took his seat in Parliament by the influence of Sir James\r\nLowther. Sir Robert was 21 when he was returned for Cashel, by the\r\ninfluence of his father. Both lived, and, so to speak, died on that\r\ngrand stage. If Pitt is to be recognised as the boldest and bravest\r\nMinister that ever conducted a country through the perils and disasters\r\nof a protracted war, Peel must be regarded as the most courageous\r\nstatesman that ever dared to guide a busy nation through the peculiar\r\ndangers that environ a period of long peace. Pitt set up a principle of\r\naction as his guiding star, and steered his course by its light, against\r\nthe bitterest opposition and the most vehement remonstrance, and died,\r\nstill proclaiming the safety of his chosen path. Peel, in a later age,\r\nand under different circumstances, sacrificed, year after year, his\r\nstrong convictions, in order to direct within safe channels the popular\r\ncurrent which in spite of all his efforts to resist it, flowed on until\r\nit threatened to destroy and drown all obstacles--good or evil--that\r\nopposed its progress. Had Pitt lived in the days of Peel, his sagacity\r\nwould have compelled the same policy. The proof of Peel’s sound wisdom\r\nwas emphatically witnessed when he ceased to be Minister in 1846, but\r\ncontinued, until his cruel and untimely end, to exercise the greatest\r\ninfluence of all living men, over the destinies of his country. More\r\npotent than even the Prime Minister who had unseated him, was Sir Robert\r\nPeel, from 1846 until 1850. Many are the claims of Peel upon our\r\ngratitude. He reformed our criminal code; he advanced the cause of\r\nreligious freedom; he repealed the corn laws. His attainments as a\r\nscholar were great, and he was a warm encourager of literature and art.\r\nHis secret charities to men of genius--revealed since his death--declare\r\nthe goodness of his heart. It is said that he had few friends in public\r\nlife. It may be difficult for a politician to enjoy this luxury. In the\r\nbosom of his own family he was beloved.\r\n\r\n  [This fine colossal statue, which will be found at the south-west\r\n  angle of the great Transept and Nave, is by Baron Marochetti. It is\r\n  executed in bronze.]\r\n\r\n473. SIR MICHAEL O’LOCHLEN. _Lawyer._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1789. Died 1842. Aged 53.]\r\n\r\nA judge in Ireland, of high legal attainments, great practical\r\nknowledge, and unwearied industry. The first Roman Catholic created law\r\nofficer of the Crown, and raised to the bench, since the Revolution of\r\n1688. A member of the Church of Rome, he owed his promotion to the\r\nLiberal party. Appointed Attorney-General 1835, Baron of the Exchequer\r\n1836, and Master of the Rolls 1837. He was earnest in his endeavours to\r\npromote the ends of justice, courteous in manners, and kind in\r\ndisposition. All parties esteemed and admired him for his judicial\r\nconduct, and, after his decease, Lord Lyndhurst, a political opponent,\r\npaid a just and feeling tribute to his memory.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore, for the Incorporated Law Society of Dublin.]\r\n\r\n474. LORD JOHN RUSSELL. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1792. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe third son of the sixth Duke of Bedford. Has served many offices of\r\nstate, amongst others that of Prime Minister of England. The recognised\r\nleader of the Whig party, and the representative of the school of\r\nCharles James Fox. The author of a work on the Constitution of England,\r\nof a tragedy, and of other books. The editor, also, of the Memoirs of\r\nThomas Moore, the poet. Lord John Russell is considered one of our first\r\nconstitutional statesmen. His course is not always so distinctly marked\r\nas to be obvious and intelligible to every looker-on. Now he is too\r\nliberal for Conservatives, now too conservative for Liberals; to-day he\r\noffends the lovers of religious toleration by his legislation against\r\nspiritual freedom; to-morrow he will distress bigotry by his zeal for\r\nreligious independence. Yet Lord John is a man of mark and influence:\r\nand when he suffers his soul to be kindled into warmth, the sympathies\r\nof men rally involuntarily around him. The prominent feature in the\r\ncharacter of this distinguished statesman, is the supreme absence of\r\nself-mistrust, be the matter in hand what it may.\r\n\r\n475. DAVID SALOMONS. _Alderman._\r\n\r\n  [Born in London, 1797. Still living.]\r\n\r\nThe first Hebrew gentleman who has held civic appointment, and sat as\r\nmember of parliament, though but for a day, in the House of Commons. Was\r\nelected sheriff of London in 1835, and alderman of Aldgate-ward in\r\n1836; but could not take his seat in consequence of the existing state\r\nof the law, which practically excluded Jews. In the year 1844, elected\r\nalderman of the ward of Portsoken, but the election again annulled. The\r\nlaw having been altered by Sir Robert Peel’s government in 1847, elected\r\nwithout opposition, in that year, alderman of Cordwainers’ ward. In\r\n1851, returned to parliament for the borough of Greenwich. Taking his\r\nseat, he maintained his right to remain there; but he was ordered to\r\nwithdraw, the law of the land forbidding his presence until he could\r\ntake the necessary oaths. The claims of the Jews to equal rights with\r\ntheir fellow citizens are identified with the name of David Salomons, as\r\nthey have been maintained chiefly by his untiring exertions.\r\n\r\n  [From the marble by Edward Davis.]\r\n\r\n476. SIR WILLIAM FOLLETT. _Lawyer._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Devonshire, 1798. Died in London, 1845. Aged 46.]\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated advocate of his time. Remarkable for the lucidity of\r\nhis intellect, for his extensive and accurate legal knowledge, for his\r\nacute discrimination, his intuitive sagacity, and for his power of\r\nrapidly transferring his whole attention to anything that might be\r\nbrought before it. His reasoning faculties were of the highest order,\r\nand his memory was singularly quick and retentive. His manner calm,\r\ndignified, and graceful, and his temper serene and unruffled. His\r\nlabours at the bar were excessive, and prosecuted in the midst of pain\r\nand sickness. He died comparatively early, worn out by disease and work.\r\nHe had served Her Majesty as Solicitor-General, and, had he lived, would\r\ninevitably have taken the highest position open to his profession.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n477. THE EARL OF DERBY. _Statesman._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1799. Still living.]\r\n\r\nHas been Chief Secretary for Ireland, Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies, and Prime Minister. Has served with the Whigs under Lord Grey,\r\nand with the Conservatives under Sir Robert Peel. Since the death of Sir\r\nRobert, has headed the extreme Tory party. Lord Derby is one of the\r\nreadiest, most eloquent, clever, and fluent speakers in the House of\r\nLords. When in the House of Commons, he was styled by Mr. Disraeli “The\r\nPrince Rupert of Debate.” As a lieutenant, he was brilliant, fierce, and\r\nirresistible in assault. As a leader, he did not discover the\r\ncomprehensive grasp, the knowledge, and administrative skill of his\r\nillustrious predecessor and chief, Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore. 1839.

Lieutenant Hooper commanded the second cutter in the\r\nremarkable voyage of the boats of Her Majesty’s ship “Plover” from Icy\r\nCape to Cape Bathurst. Lost for three days and nights in an Arctic snow\r\nstorm, quartered two long and lonely winters away from his ship in\r\nlog-huts with a few of his men, under every privation, he brought home\r\nthe fastened malady of the lungs which so early cut short his ardent\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n  [This bust is by David Dunbar.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELATES AND THEOLOGIANS.\r\n\r\n481. CARDINAL WOLSEY. _Minister of State._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Ipswich, 1471. Died at Leicester, 1530. Aged 59.]\r\n\r\nA butcher’s son, with an inordinate appetence for place, power, and\r\nmoney. A magnificent pluralist, whose insatiable desire for wealth was\r\nredeemed only by the noble uses to which he applied a portion of his\r\nworldly goods. His revenues almost equalled those of the crown, and many\r\nof his acts were princely, as became the rival of a king. Wolsey founded\r\nseveral lectures at Oxford, built Christ Church in that University, and\r\nerected Hampton Court, which, in his splendid generosity, he presented\r\nto Henry VIII. He owed his first advancement to Henry VII., who sent him\r\non an embassy to the Emperor of Germany, and afterwards made him Dean of\r\nLincoln. His rise was, thenceforwards rapid. He became, under Henry\r\nVIII., Cardinal, Lord Chancellor, and Pope’s Legate. His fall was\r\nheadlong. Offending the king by refusing to sanction his divorce, he was\r\ndisgraced in an hour, and compelled to disgorge his enormous\r\nacquisitions. He was arrested at York, but, falling sick on his way to\r\nLondon, died at Leicester. Much of Wolsey’s wealth was, no doubt,\r\nill-gotten; his ambition knew no bounds; his insolence was\r\nintolerable;--but he had in many respects a grand and royal mind, and\r\nthe benefits conferred by him upon learning are never to be omitted in a\r\nhistory of his remarkable life.\r\n\r\n  [Presented by Mr. John Archbutt, London.]\r\n\r\n482.

Distinguished for his classical\r\nattainments, and before his elevation to the bench, known as the\r\naccomplished editor of the tragedies of Æschylus. As a churchman,\r\nCharles James Blomfield has endeavoured to take a middle and\r\nconciliatory course, notwithstanding his decided bent towards the high\r\nchurch party. It is no reproach to the Bishop of London to say that he\r\nhas occasionally stumbled, upon a difficult and slippery path.\r\n\r\n  [By W. Behnes.]\r\n\r\n482A. CHARLES JAMES BLOMFIELD. _Bishop of London._\r\n\r\n  [By Henry Weigall.]\r\n\r\n483. FATHER THEOBALD MATHEW. _Temperance Reformer._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Thomastown, in Ireland, 1790. Still living.]\r\n\r\nA modern crusader, who has drawn his spiritual sword against one of the\r\ndeadliest foes to religion, civilisation, and human happiness. An\r\napostle who carries glad tidings to every hearth, irrespectively of the\r\naltar raised there for divine worship. A proselytiser who converts\r\nRomanist and Protestant, with equal advantage and safety to both. He was\r\neducated at Maynooth; is a Romish priest; and his whole life has been\r\nspent in an anxious and a humane endeavour to release mankind from the\r\nself-imposed yoke of Drunkenness. He is the founder of the “total\r\nabstinence” principle, in virtue of which self-denying ordinance\r\n“pledged” men abstain from any use whatever of intoxicating liquors. The\r\nsuccess of the good and courageous man has been equal to his deserts:\r\nboth are inestimable. Under his teaching the most hardened drunkards\r\nhave become abstemious, and the most reckless and improvident have been\r\nwon to self-respect and virtuous conduct. No preacher in the olden or\r\nthe modern time has surpassed his earnestness or his labour. Hundreds of\r\nthousands have taken the pledge from his hands in Ireland, in this\r\ncountry, and in the United States. If some of the number have been\r\nunfaithful to their plighted word, the weakness of humanity will explain\r\nthe defection. That thousands are the better, the wiser, the happier,\r\nand the purer for his labours, is beyond all doubt. A few patriots like\r\nFather Mathew, would have changed the face of nature in Ireland years\r\nago. His work, now, is productive of hourly good. The man who only\r\nchecks the growth of Drunkenness is a benefactor of his kind. He who\r\nextinguishes the vice in a hundred thousand beasts, is one of the\r\nmightiest of human conquerors.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore, 1845.]\r\n\r\n484. CARDINAL WISEMAN. _Chief of the Romish Church in England._\r\n\r\n  [Born at Seville, in Spain, 1802. Still living.]\r\n\r\nCame to England in 1808. Educated at the English college in Rome, where\r\nhe took his degree of D.D. in 1824. Consecrated Bishop of Melipotamus in\r\n1840, and made Vicar Apostolic of the London district in 1849. Created\r\nCardinal, 1850. Cardinal Wiseman is a man of vast learning and eminent\r\nability. His lectures on the Connexion between Science and Revealed\r\nReligion constitute a noble and masterly vindication of the cause which\r\nthe lectures are intended to maintain, and are full of the happiest\r\nillustration. The style of Cardinal Wiseman is forcible, logical, and\r\neloquent; and it is said that he writes with equal ease the language of\r\nnearly all the European nations. He is the seventh English Cardinal\r\nsince the Reformation.\r\n\r\n  [By Christopher Moore. 1850.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGS AND QUEENS.\r\n\r\n485. EDWARD III. _King of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1313. Died 1377. Aged 64.]\r\n\r\nAn accomplished monarch, brave, and for his time enlightened. In his\r\nday, and by his act, the power of the Commons rose, and the pretensions\r\nof the Barons were reduced; several constitutional acts found their way\r\nto the statute book, and greater security was given by law to property\r\nand person. Glorious battles were fought in France; the field of Cressy\r\nwas won, and Calais surrendered in 1346. Edward, Prince of Wales,\r\nsurnamed the Black Prince, was the worthy son of this redoubtable sire.\r\nFollowing in the steps of his father, he won, in 1355, the battle of\r\nPoitiers, took the French king and his son prisoners, and brought them\r\nto London. In this reign, Queen’s College, Oxford, and Clare Hall,\r\nPembroke Hall, Trinity Hall, and Caius, all colleges at Cambridge, were\r\nfounded. Windsor Castle also was built by Edward III., William of\r\nWykeham, afterwards Bishop of Winchester, and Chancellor of England, and\r\nthe founder of Winchester College, being “Clerk of the works.” Under\r\nEdward III., the first toll was levied for mending the highways; the\r\nhighway concerned being the road between St. Giles’s and Temple Bar.\r\nUpon the whole, a grand time for England.\r\n\r\n  [From the Effigy.]\r\n\r\n486. ELEANORA OF CASTILE. _Surnamed The Faithful. First Queen of Edward\r\nI., of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born in Castile, 1243. Died at Grantham, 1290. Aged 47.]\r\n\r\nA queen who has been described as “a loving mother to our nation, the\r\ncolumn and pillar of the whole realm,”--godly, modest, merciful. The\r\nunited influence of loveliness, virtue, and sweet temper, inspired in\r\nthe heart of her renowned lord an attachment as deep as it was true. She\r\nwas the mother of the first Prince of Wales. When, in 1269, her husband\r\ntook up the Cross, Eleanora resolved to share the dangers of his Syrian\r\ncampaign. Her ladies of the Court endeavouring to dissuade her from the\r\njourney, she replied, “Nothing ought to part those whom God has joined;\r\nand the way to heaven is as near, if not nearer, from Syria, as from\r\nEngland or my native Spain.” She was a patroness of literature and art,\r\nand civilisation advanced under the auspices of her well-regulated\r\nCourt. Taken ill at Grantham, whilst her husband was in Scotland, she\r\nexpired there. Edward followed her body thence to Westminster in the\r\nbitterest grief, and on the spot marked by the close of every stage,\r\nvowed to erect a cross in memory of his _chère reine_. The crosses of\r\nNorthampton and Waltham still remain, models of architectural beauty.\r\nCharing Cross was the last resting-place before the body was carried\r\ninto Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n  [From the Effigy.]\r\n\r\n487. HENRY VII. _King of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1456. Died 1509. Aged 53.]\r\n\r\nA monarch whose greatest vice was avarice. He was inordinately fond of\r\nmoney. He had 14,000_l._ a-year allowed him by his first Parliament for\r\nhis Household expenses, and 2000_l._ a-year for his wardrobe; yet he\r\nleft behind him a sum equivalent to 16,000,000_l._ at the present day.\r\nWith no worse quality than avarice, he had no quality that can be called\r\ngreat. He was brave, politic, attentive to business, reserved,\r\nsuspicious. His chief merit consisted in closing the civil wars, and\r\nsecuring peace and order in the country. He died at Richmond, and was\r\nburied in the magnificent chapel at Westminster, erected by himself. He\r\nalso built “The Great Harry,” the first ship in the English Navy, ships\r\nbefore this time having been hired or pressed from merchants. It cost\r\n14,000_l._ The King seems to have had remorse for his rapacity on his\r\ndeath-bed. He issued a general pardon for all offences, released all\r\ndebtors, himself paying the debts of many; converted the Palace of the\r\nSavoy into an hospital; built several religious houses; and ordered\r\nrestitution to be made to all men whom he had wronged by his extortions.\r\nIt is unnecessary to state that his successor being his son, Henry\r\nVIII., not the slightest effect followed from the “restitution” clause.\r\n\r\n488. ELIZABETH. _Queen of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1533. Died 1603. Aged 70.]\r\n\r\nA mighty sovereign, and the last of our absolute monarchs. Her rule,\r\ndespotic, but grand, and wholly in the interests of her country. A true\r\nEnglishwoman, ambitious of England’s glory, and capable of inspiring her\r\nservants by her example, with unbounded zeal, patriotism, and heroism.\r\nAs a woman, the picture less fascinating. Too selfish to be amiable, she\r\nwas vain, imperious, violent. She had favourites, but none whom she\r\nwould raise to the throne, for she hugged power with a passionate\r\nembrace, which no generous sentiment could unfasten, and no tender\r\nconsideration induce her to divide. She stood above law, and she knew\r\nit. A man sharing her throne might have been less fortunate. Her\r\nsuccessor proved so; and the son of that successor, trying the perilous\r\nascent, lost his head in the attempt. Wondrous was the reign of\r\nElizabeth in its effects upon the civilisation of the world. It produced\r\nBacon in philosophy, Shakspeare and Spenser in poetry, Gresham in\r\ncommerce. Drake and Raleigh also belong to this time. It was the era of\r\nthe re-establishment of Protestantism, and of the rescue, on the sea, of\r\nspiritual liberty from the threatened onslaught of Spain. Undoubtedly\r\nElizabeth was surrounded by great men, but her masculine spirit sat at\r\nthe helm, and directed, for nearly fifty years, the course of the State\r\nvessel. Her vigilance was sleepless, her ability unbounded, her sagacity\r\npenetrating and quick; yet she had a love of finery that was frivolous,\r\nand to the last laboured under the impression that she was beautiful.\r\nThe spirit of maritime discovery was now alive in England, and commerce\r\nflourished. When dying, Elizabeth was asked by Cecil who should succeed\r\nher. She answered, “No rascal. My seat has been the seat of kings. Who\r\nshould succeed me but a king?”\r\n\r\n  [From the Effigy.]\r\n\r\n489. EDWARD VI. _King of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1537. Died 1553. Aged 16.]\r\n\r\nThe son of Henry VIII. by Jane Seymour, who died two days after the\r\nbirth of her child. Edward was ten years old at the time of his\r\naccession to the throne. Before his character could be permanently\r\nformed he died, yet his form stands out in English history illuminated\r\nwith intelligence, gentleness, and wisdom. He was fond of books,\r\ndiligent in business, a lover of justice. He kept a diary, which still\r\nexists. Therein he noted down the characters of the good men by whom he\r\nwas surrounded, how they lived, and what example they offered for his\r\npious imitation. Well acquainted with foreign matters, and with the\r\nhistory and geography of his own country; zealous for knowledge, and\r\nambitious of governing well. In this reign the first journal of the\r\nproceedings of the House of Commons was kept; the Common Prayer Book was\r\nestablished by Act of Parliament; Sternhold translated the psalms into\r\nEnglish metre; and the king gave his palace at Bridewell for the lodging\r\nof poor travellers, and for the correction of vagabonds. Christ’s\r\nhospital, for the education of youth, and the hospitals of St.\r\nBartholomew and St. Thomas, for the reception of the sick, were also\r\nfounded by him. His concern, Alfred-like--and so young!--for exalting\r\nthe character, by the instruction, of his people, was shown in the\r\nfoundation of numerous free schools throughout the kingdom, which still\r\nbear and endear his name. Edward was very handsome. He died of\r\nconsumption, brought on by an attack of small-pox and measles.\r\n\r\n  [Presented by Mr. John Archbutt, London.]\r\n\r\n490. MARY STUART. _Queen of Scots._\r\n\r\n  [Born, 1542. Died, 1587. Aged 45.]\r\n\r\nA queen whose calamities fill our eyes with tears, so that we can hardly\r\nsee the frailties of the woman. Her loveliness, her learning, her\r\nmisfortunes, her wit, and fascinating manners, have attached to her\r\nmemory an interest and affection which even the deeply-founded suspicion\r\nof her crimes cannot efface. Various judgments have been pronounced upon\r\nher conduct. But one report has come down to us of her perfect beauty of\r\ncountenance, her winning manners, and her elegance of form. Grave\r\nhistorians speak with admiration of her jet black hair, her exquisite\r\ncomplexion, her delicate white arm and hand, her stature that rose to a\r\nmajestic height. Her treatment of Darnley, brutal though he was, and her\r\nmarriage with Bothwell after Darnley’s assassination, are blots that\r\nstill cling to her character. But even these offences would seem more\r\nthan expiated by her eighteen years’ imprisonment, and her unwarranted\r\nexecution, that foulest stain upon the reign of our own Elizabeth. Mary\r\nStuart was violent in her attachments, vivacious, indiscreet, fond of\r\nflattery, and conscious of the power of her charms. It is said that her\r\nheart was warm and unsuspicious. It may be questioned whether she was\r\nalways sincere. One of her recent biographers in France has styled her\r\nthe “eternal enigma of history,” “the most problematical of all\r\nhistorical personages.” Disastrous as was her own story, the fate of her\r\nimmediate descendants was even worse. A curse was upon the line. Yet her\r\nlineage flourishes now. It is found in England, Prussia, Denmark, and\r\nHanover; in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Naples, Sardinia, and Modena.\r\n\r\n  [From the Effigy.]\r\n\r\n490.* CHARLES THE FIRST. _King of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1600. Beheaded 30th January, 1649. Aged 49.]\r\n\r\nGrandson of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, whose misfortunes and drear\r\nfate he inherited, if he did not invite. A monarch whose exaggerated\r\nnotions of prerogative, whose obstinacy, wilfulness, untruthfulness, and\r\ndouble-dealing, justified the resistance of a people awakened to a sense\r\nof their rights, and roused to the vindication of their liberties; yet a\r\nman whose sorrows, whose dignified bearing in misfortune, whose private\r\nvirtues, love of literature and art, and gentle demeanour, render him an\r\nobject of the deepest commiseration, and the most plaintive interest.\r\nHis death was deliberate murder; and there is too much reason to fear\r\nthat they who thought least of defending liberty, were the most thirsty\r\nof his blood. Yet some palliation for the guilt is found in the\r\ncircumstance that in the public dealings of Charles with his Parliament\r\nhis plighted word was not worth the paper upon which it was given.\r\nIrresolute and double-minded, he had never kept faith with his people.\r\nIt was the misfortune of Charles to be born at a period when the\r\nconflicting elements of Royalty and Democracy were seething into tumult.\r\nHad he lived a little earlier, or a little later he would not have lost\r\nhis head upon the block. A little earlier, the “divinity that doth hedge\r\na king” would have shielded him in England from the sacrilege. A little\r\nlater, he would have been hunted from English soil, as his son was. The\r\ncatastrophe of his unhappy reign can never be re-enacted. His blood\r\npurchased that security. Never had the character of Englishmen, in many\r\nrespects, looked so fair to the world as during the civil wars of\r\nCharles the First. The true-hearted loyal gentlemen who, knowing by\r\nexperience the character of their master, yet clung to his cause and to\r\nhis person until the last extremity, counting all sacrifice as\r\ndelightful service, were not surpassed by the professed knights of\r\nchivalry. The devoted Republicans, who for the sake of man’s rights and\r\nGod’s blessing seized arms for the first time in their lives, and became\r\ngreat Generals and Admirals--the glory of their country, and the terror\r\nof the world--take rank in the estimation of history, side by side with\r\nher most splendid heroes. We receive from them our cherished charters,\r\nand the liberty which finds no harm even when Europe is in\r\nconflagration. Terrible indeed must have been the state of the\r\natmosphere in 1649, when the thunderbolt fell that struck down Charles,\r\nbut purified the air for ever afterwards.\r\n\r\n  [The statue of Charles the First, which is in the South Transept, is\r\n  from the bronze equestrian statue by Hubert le Sueur, which was\r\n  erected at Charing Cross in the year 1674. It had been cast in 1633,\r\n  near the church in Covent Garden, but never placed: and during the\r\n  wars it was sold by Parliament to a brazier “living at the Dial, near\r\n  Holborn Conduit,” with strict orders that he should break it up. The\r\n  brazier concealed the statue and horse underground until after the\r\n  Restoration. Le Sueur was a Frenchman, and pupil of John of Bologna.\r\n  He arrived in England about 1630, and died here. The pedestal is by\r\n  Grinling Gibbons, who was born about the middle of the 17th century.]\r\n\r\n491. JAMES II. _King of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born in England, 1633. Died in France, 1701. Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nThe second son of Charles I., whose fate he challenged by his obstinacy,\r\nwilfulness, and double dealing. He was a Roman Catholic, and in the\r\nblind defence and advocacy of his faith against the Constitution and\r\nlaws of the country he governed, he perilled his crown which he lost,\r\nand his life which he ignominiously saved. He was not without good\r\nqualities. He was personally brave--not unmindful of the services of\r\nfriends, and he exhibited devotion in the maintenance of the religious\r\ncause which he believed it his paramount duty to uphold. But he was\r\nbigotted, cruel, and wrongheaded. He could not be trusted whenever he\r\nwas acting in the interests of the Pope. Louis XIV. in vain remonstrated\r\nwith his royal cousin of England. James II. was too sincere a zealot to\r\nlisten to reason. Louis Quatorze was too fine a gentleman, and too\r\npractised a courtier, to be betrayed into fanaticism. When James went a\r\nfugitive and an exile to France, Louis received him with a magnificence\r\nworthy of a triumphal progress.\r\n\r\n  [From the well-known statue by Grinling Gibbons in Privy Gardens,\r\n  Whitehall. Represented in the costume of a Roman Emperor, according to\r\n  the taste of the day.]\r\n\r\n492. GEORGE III. _King of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1738. Died 1820. Aged 82.]\r\n\r\nThe grandfather of her Majesty Queen Victoria. He reigned during sixty\r\nyears, although during the last ten, he could take no part in public\r\naffairs. A king with many good qualities of heart and head, but\r\nobstinate, self-willed and not always sincere in his dealings with his\r\nMinisters. He is styled “The father of his people;” and his honest\r\ndesire to secure their well-being and happiness, according to his own\r\nideas of government, entitled him to the enviable distinction. In\r\nprivate life, George III. offered an admirable example for imitation to\r\nhis subjects. But his wilful persistence in the maintenance of what he\r\nconceived his Royal prerogative, plunged England into war with America,\r\nand caused the premature loss to the country of that magnificent British\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\n  [By John Bacon, R.A., when the King was 30 years old.]\r\n\r\n493. GEORGE IV. _King of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1762. Died 1830. Aged 68.]\r\n\r\nIn 1811, during the lifetime of his father, this prince was appointed\r\nRegent: and in 1820, upon the death of George III., he succeeded to the\r\nthrone. The reign of this monarch is rendered memorable, by the\r\nscandalous proceedings instituted against Queen Caroline, and by the\r\npassing of the Act in 1829, which tolerated the Roman Catholic religion\r\nin the United Kingdom. George IV. was considered the first gentleman in\r\nEurope whilst he lived. Since his departure, history has pronounced him\r\nheartless, sensual, self-absorbed, and negligent of the true interests\r\nof his subjects, though not without some kingly qualities.\r\n\r\n494. WILLIAM IV. _King of England._\r\n\r\n  [Born 1765. Died 1837. Aged 72.]\r\n\r\nThe third son of George III., and uncle of Queen Victoria. He succeeded\r\nhis brother George IV. in 1830. His reign is remarkable as that in which\r\nthe Reform Bill passed, changing the constitution of England by widening\r\nits basis. This King was before his marriage the father of several\r\nchildren, since ennobled, the mother being Mrs. Jordan, one of the most\r\nfascinating actresses and kind-hearted women of her time.\r\n\r\n494A.

The general reader, too, is perhaps equally familiar with\r\nthem. We have them in such words as Geo-_logy_. Astro-_logy_,\r\nPhysio-_logy_, and a long list besides. The Greek form of these would be\r\nGeo-_logia_, Astro-_logia_, &c. The basis of the term is the substantive\r\n_logos_, meaning a _word_. In its modified form, however, and in its\r\napplication as the element of a compound word, it means the\r\n_principles_, or _science_, of the department (whatever it may be) that\r\nis denoted by the root which precedes it. In the word before us it means\r\nthe _principles_ of that department of human knowledge which is denoted\r\nby the form _Ethno_.\r\n\r\n_Ethnology_ means the science, not exactly of the different _nations of\r\nthe world_, but of the different _varieties of the human species_.\r\n\r\nIt is not thought necessary to enlarge upon this further, since, it is\r\nhoped, that the groups to which the visitor is directed will\r\nsufficiently tell their own tale. The extent to which they differ from\r\neach other is manifest. Still more do they differ from such groups of\r\nEnglishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, and other Europeans as may collect\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the varieties that are especially illustrated are\r\nforeign to Europe; it being supposed that the character of most\r\nEuropean populations is sufficiently understood. Hence, the Ethnology is\r\nthat of Asia, Africa, and the New World. Of these, the most remarkable\r\nvarieties are found under the extremes of heat and cold; under the\r\ntropics, and within the arctic circle. The intermediate and more\r\ntemperate parts of the different continents, though by no means\r\ndeficient in interesting and important varieties, supply fewer.\r\n\r\nOf the populations within the arctic circle, it is only those of America\r\nthat are illustrated (viz., in the Greenland group). The character,\r\nhowever, of the tribes thus far north, is pretty similar in all three\r\ncontinents--in Asia and Europe for the new, in America for the old,\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe science of ethnology is, to a great extent, a new one, and this has\r\nbeen our excuse for enlarging upon the meaning, and entering into the\r\norigin of the word. Even ethnological museums are rare. The plan,\r\nhowever, of the groups under notice, is different from that of ordinary\r\nmuseums, and, at the same time, one which is, now, for the first time\r\nattempted. The trees, plants, animals, and human occupants of the\r\ndifferent portions of the earth’s surface are grouped together--so that\r\nthe allied sciences of botany, zoology, and ethnology illustrate each\r\nother. Hence, the arrangement is _geographical_.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement is so far geographical that, to a certain extent, the\r\nvisitor is enabled to place himself in respect to the objects before him\r\nin the same relation as he would be to a map of the world. Here, the\r\nNorth lies in front of him, the East to his right, the West to his left.\r\nIn like manner, the groups on his right belong to Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica; those on his left to America. In other words--the Old World is\r\non one side, the New on the other. The relations of North and South,\r\nhowever, are given with less nicety. As a general rule, however, the\r\nSouthern parts of the two worlds (the old and new), are the parts\r\nnearest the entrance--and the Northern parts lie beyond them.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Islands the plan of giving the exact botany of the country\r\nunder notice has been departed from--owing to the difficulties of detail\r\nin the case of an inter-tropical vegetation, of which but few specimens\r\nare found in European collections.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP I.\r\n\r\nTIBETANS. (FOR ZOOLOGY, &C. _See_ p. 82.)\r\n\r\nThe figures here are Tibetans. The variety to which both belong is\r\nusually called the _Mongolian_; by which it is meant that the most\r\nremarkable examples of it are to be found in the Chinese province of\r\nMongolia--to the west of the Great Wall. Here it is where the\r\ncheek-bones attain a greater breadth than is the case with even the\r\nfigures before us, where the nose is more flattened, and where the\r\ndistance between the eyes is greater. Here it is where one of the great\r\nconquerors of the world arose, Jinjiz-Khan, in the thirteenth century;\r\nunder whom, and under whose successors, nearly half the world trembled\r\nat the terrible name of _Mongol_. However, at present, their character\r\nis a very different one. The Mongolians of the nineteenth century are\r\nquiet, peaceable men, subject to China and Russia--chiefly, however, to\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nThus much has been said concerning the Mongolians, in order to explain\r\nthe meaning of the term. It has two powers. It is used in a general and\r\nin a limited sense. When _limited_, it means the inhabitant of\r\n_Mongolia_; when _general_, it denotes any one of the numerous allied\r\npopulations--allied in respect to their physical organisation.\r\n\r\nOf all the Mongol populations, the Chinese are the most civilised;\r\nunless we make an exception in favour of the equally Mongolian Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans are subject to the Chinese, similar to a great extent in\r\nform, similar to a great extent in creed, but dissimilar in habits.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans are a _pastoral_, the Chinese an eminently _agricultural_\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nAs the southern frontier of the Tibetan family comes in contact with the\r\nnorthern provinces of India--as some portion of the Tibetan area is\r\nabsolutely under either the British or some other Indian government--we\r\nmay expect to find the Mongolians on _both_ sides of the Himalayan\r\nMountains--in India, as well as in Chinese Tartary.\r\n\r\nThis prepares us for--\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP II.\r\n\r\nEAST INDIANS. (_See_ p. 82.)\r\n\r\nThe Tibetan (the figure on the left) we have seen before. He differs\r\nfrom those of Group I. only in belonging to the southern side of the\r\nHimalayas;--to the parts drained by the Sutlej; to the water-system of\r\nthe Indus.\r\n\r\nIn India Proper the languages fall into two divisions: those akin to the\r\nTamul, spoken in the Dekhan, or Southern India, and those akin to the\r\nHindúi, spoken along the northern bank of the Ganges; in Oude, &c.\r\n\r\nThere are also in India Proper two types of physical form; in one the\r\ncolour is dark, or even black, the skin coarse, the face flattened, the\r\nlips thick; in the other the colour is brunette, the nose aquiline, the\r\neyebrows arched, regular, and delicate, the lips of moderate thickness,\r\nthe face oval, the features intelligent. Each is represented in the\r\npresent group, though neither in the extreme form.\r\n\r\nAs a general, but by no means as an invariable, rule, the darker\r\ncomplexions preponderate over the lighter ones as we go southwards,\r\nexcept in the mountains, where the skin becomes fairer.\r\n\r\nIt is not considered necessary to enlarge upon what is called the system\r\nof _caste_ in India. It means that the son follows the business of the\r\nfather, so that the descendants of (say) a blacksmith will be\r\nblacksmiths, and so on. It also means that between individuals of\r\ndifferent _castes_ there are certain prejudices; certain points whereon\r\nthere is a reluctance to intermix. Hence, individuals of a higher,\r\nrefuse to intermarry with those of a lower _caste_. They refuse also to\r\ntake their meals with them.\r\n\r\nNow, as a general, but by no means as an invariable, rule, the higher\r\nthe _caste_ the greater the predominance of the second type of form,\r\n_i.e._, the finer the features, the clearer the complexion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIndia and China, we must remember, are countries that have long been\r\ncivilised--civilised after their own peculiar fashion. More than this,\r\nthey are countries from which a civilisation has been diffused over\r\ndistricts more or less barbarous. On the other hand, the Mahometan creed\r\nhas diffused, and is diffusing itself, over India, at the expense of\r\nthe original (so-called) Braminical and Buddhist religions.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which Indian civilisation has (after first spreading\r\nitself abroad) been modified by a subsequent diffusion of Mahometanism,\r\nwill be seen when we move from India to the Islands of the Indian\r\nArchipelago--Sumatra, Java, Borneo, &c.\r\n\r\nHere the division of the human species to which the populations belong\r\nis the _Malay_---just as that to which the Chinese and Tibetans were\r\nreferred was the Mongolian.\r\n\r\nJust, too, as the word _Mongolian_ had a _wider_ and a _narrower_\r\nsignification, so has the term _Malay_. A true and proper Malay is a\r\nMahometan, from either certain parts of Sumatra, or certain parts of the\r\nMalayan Peninsula--from Sincapore, from Malacca, from Penang, from\r\nBencoolen, &c. On the other hand, a member of the Malay family, in the\r\nwider sense of the word, may be a Pagan in religion, an Indian in\r\ndoctrine, or a native of Java or Borneo, in respect to his locality.\r\n\r\nThe Malays, in the wider sense of the word, whatever may be the minor\r\ndifferences between them, have the same general physiognomy; being short\r\nrather than tall, darker than the generality of Mongolians, though\r\nlighter than the southern Indians, and broadfaced, though less so than\r\nthe more extreme Mongolians. When in contact with the sea, they exhibit\r\ndecided maritime habits. Many other of their customs in detail deserve\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n_Bodily disfigurations under the idea of ornament._--The Malay dress is\r\nbecoming; but the habit of permanently disfiguring parts of the body\r\nunder the idea of ornament, is of sufficient prominence to take place\r\namongst the characteristics of the branch.\r\n\r\n_a._ _Tattooing._--This is sometimes limited, sometimes general:\r\nsometimes over the whole body, sometimes confined to the arms only. In\r\nAfrica the patterns vary with the tribe. In certain Malay districts, an\r\napproach to the distinction may be found; for instance, we hear in\r\nBorneo of some tribes that always tattoo, of others that partially\r\ntattoo, of others that do not tattoo at all. Nay more; the habit of\r\ntattooing seems in some cases to go along with certain other habits--by\r\nno means naturally connected with it. Thus certain of the Borneo\r\nnon-tattooed tribes never use the _Sumpitan_, or blow-pipe; whilst\r\nothers are tattooed, and use it.\r\n\r\nSo at least Sir J. Brooke was informed; although I think the careful\r\nperuser of his journal will find that the coincidence is not always\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n_b._ _Depilation._--Depilation is effected either by quick-lime or\r\ntweezers. Generally, I believe, the parts of the body which are meant to\r\nbe kept smooth are rubbed with quick-lime; and the isolated hairs that\r\nafterwards appear, are plucked out carefully by tweezers in detail.\r\n\r\n_c._ _Filing the teeth, dyeing the teeth._ This is a Malay habit, and\r\nthere are not less than three varieties of this operation.\r\n\r\n1. Sometimes the enamel, and no more, is filed off. This enables the\r\ntooth to receive and retain its appropriate dye.\r\n\r\n2. Sometimes the teeth are merely pointed.\r\n\r\n3. Sometimes they are filed down to the gums.\r\n\r\nDyeing may follow filing, or not, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra, where a jetty blackness is aimed at, the empyreumatic oil of\r\nthe cocoa-nut is used. Even, however, if no dyeing follow, the teeth\r\nwill become black from the simple filing, if the chewing of the\r\nbetel-nut be habitual.\r\n\r\n_d._ _Distension of the ears._--Many of the tribes that file their\r\nteeth, also distend their ears. Both are Malay habits. In some parts of\r\nSumatra, when the child is young, the ear is bored, and rings are put\r\nin. In other parts, however, the rings are weighted, so as to pull down\r\nthe lobe; or ornaments, gradually increased in diameter, are inserted;\r\nso that the perforation becomes enlarged.\r\n\r\nSimple perforation may extend to a mere multiplication of the holes of\r\nthe ear. In Borneo, the Sakarran tribes wear more earrings than one, and\r\nare distinguished accordingly; “when you meet a man with many rings\r\ndistrust him” being one of their cautions. Mr. Brooke met a Sakarran\r\nwith twelve rings in his ear.\r\n\r\n_e._ _Growth of the nails._--In parts of Borneo, the right thumbnail is\r\nencouraged to grow to a great length. So it is in parts of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n_Running-a-muck._--A Malay is capable of so far working himself into\r\nfury, of so far yielding to some spontaneous impulse, or of so far\r\nexciting himself by stimulants, as to become totally regardless of what\r\ndanger he exposes himself to. Hence, he rushes forth as an infuriated\r\nanimal, and attacks all who fall in his way, until having expended his\r\nmorbid fury he falls down exhausted. This is called _running-a-muck_.\r\n\r\n_Gambling._--This habit, or rather passion, is shared by the Malays, the\r\nIndians, the Chinese, and the Indo-Chinese; quail-fighting and\r\ncock-fighting being the forms in which it shows itself. A Malay will\r\nlose all his property on a favourite bird; and, having lost that, stake\r\nhis family; and after the loss of wife and children, his own personal\r\nliberty: being prepared to serve as a slave in case of losing.\r\n\r\n_Narcotic stimulants and masticatories._--Chewing the betel-nut is\r\nalmost universal in some of the Malay countries; the use of opiates and\r\ntobacco being also common.\r\n\r\nThe nut of the _Areca catechu_, is wrapped in the leaf of the _piper\r\nbetel_, the first being astringent, the second pungent. The addition of\r\nlime completes the preparation. This stimulates the salivary glands,\r\ntinges the saliva red, and discolours the teeth.\r\n\r\nOf the chief islands occupied by the Malay family, the first two under\r\nnotice are\r\n\r\nSUMATRA--and\r\n\r\nJAVA.--These being taken together, give us\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP III. (p. 91.)\r\n\r\nA. SUMATRANS. B. JAVANESE (OPIUM SMOKERS).\r\n\r\nA. The populations of Sumatra exhibit different degrees of civilisation\r\nto an extent found in few areas of equal size: the difference in their\r\nreligious creeds being proportionately broad. There are the extreme\r\nforms of rude paganism; there are traces of the Indian forms of\r\nreligion; and there is Mahometanism. The least clothed of the figures\r\nbefore us is a _Lubu_, one of the wildest, rudest, and weakest of all\r\nthe populations. The position of the Lubus in Sumatra is that of the\r\nBushmen of South Africa, for they are a fragmentary population, driven\r\ninto the more inaccessible districts by tribes stronger than themselves;\r\nwithout arts, and without settled habitations.\r\n\r\nThe next are _Battas_, whose civilisation is some degrees above that of\r\nthe Lubus. A great part of their present area belonged to this last\r\nnamed population, who are, probably, Battas in the very lowest stage of\r\ndevelopment. These require further notice. They belong to the northern\r\nhalf of Sumatra, though without reaching the northern extremity of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAt the very northern end we have the kingdom of Atshin, Achin, or\r\nAcheen, where the religion is Mahometan, and where the alphabet is the\r\nArabic; Atshin being the part of Sumatra where the influence of the\r\nArabian trade, Arabian religion, and Arabian language, have been the\r\ngreatest.\r\n\r\nSouth of Atshin is the Batta country. Here there is only an imperfect\r\nMahometanism, with no use of the Arabic alphabet, and but little\r\ntincture of Arab cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe rivers in the Batta country are inconsiderable, so are the forests;\r\nfor the country is an elevated platform--dry, exposed, and parched. The\r\nluxuriant vegetation of so many regions in this part of the world, finds\r\nno place here; and instead of it, we have sand, hardened clay, bare\r\nrocks swept by strong currents of wind and exposed to an equatorial sun.\r\n\r\nThe Battas are cannibals; they are also a lettered population. It is\r\nbelieved that this combination of rudeness and civilisation occurs\r\nnowhere else, a combination which, however, is beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the Batta alphabet we have books, almanacks, &c.\r\n\r\nOn the Batta cannibalism, hear so competent an authority as Marsden.\r\n“They,” the Battas, “do not eat human flesh as the means of satisfying\r\nthe cravings of nature, for there can be no want of sustenance to the\r\ninhabitants of such a country and climate, who reject no animal food of\r\nany kind; nor is it sought after as a gluttonous delicacy.\r\n\r\n“The _Battas_ eat it as a species of ceremony, as a mode of showing\r\ntheir detestation of certain crimes by an ignominious punishment, and as\r\na savage display of revenge and insult to their unfortunate enemies. The\r\nobjects of this barbarous repast are prisoners taken in war, especially\r\nif badly wounded, the bodies of the slain, and offenders condemned for\r\ncertain capital crimes, especially for adultery. Prisoners unwounded\r\n(but they are not much disposed to give quarter) may be ransomed or sold\r\nas slaves, where the quarrel is not too inveterate; and the convicts,\r\nthere is reason to believe, rarely suffer when their friends are in\r\ncircumstances to redeem them by the customary equivalent of twenty\r\n_binchangs_, or eighty dollars. These are tried by the people of the\r\ntribe where the offence was committed, but cannot be executed until\r\ntheir own particular _raja_ has been made acquainted with the sentence,\r\nwho, when he acknowledges the justice of the intended punishment, sends\r\na cloth to cover the head of the delinquent, together with a large dish\r\nof salt and lemons. The unhappy victim is then delivered into the hands\r\nof the injured party (if it be a private wrong, or, in the case of a\r\nprisoner to the warriors) by whom he is tied to a stake; lances are\r\nthrown at him from a certain distance by this person, his relatives, and\r\nfriends; and when mortally wounded, they run up to him, as if in a\r\ntransport of passion, cut pieces from the body with their knives, dip\r\nthem in the dish of salt, lemon-juice, and red pepper, slightly broil\r\nthem over a fire prepared for the purpose, and swallow the morsels with\r\na degree of savage enthusiasm. Sometimes (I presume according to the\r\ndegree of their animosity and resentment) the whole is devoured by the\r\nbystanders; and instances have been known where, with barbarity still\r\nmore aggravated, they tear the flesh from the carcase with their teeth.\r\nTo such a depth of depravity may man be plunged, when neither religion\r\nnor philosophy enlighten his steps! All that can be said in extenuation\r\nof the horror of this diabolical ceremony is, that no view appears to be\r\nentertained of torturing the sufferers, of increasing or lengthening out\r\nthe pangs of death; the whole fury is directed against the corpse, warm,\r\nindeed, with the remains of life, but past the sensation of pain. A\r\ndifference of opinion has existed with respect to the practice of eating\r\nthe bodies of their enemies actually slain in war; but subsequent\r\nenquiry has satisfied me of its being done, especially in the case of\r\ndistinguished persons, or those who have been accessories to the\r\nquarrel. It should be observed that their campaigns (which may be aptly\r\ncompared to the predatory excursions of our Borderers) often terminate\r\nwith the loss of not more than half-a-dozen men on both sides. The\r\nskulls of the victims are hung up as trophies in the open buildings in\r\nfront of their houses, and are occasionally ransomed by their surviving\r\nrelations for a sum of money.”--_Marsden’s Sumatra_, pp. 391-2.\r\n\r\nThe Battas have, probably, been more civilised than they are now--India\r\nbeing the source of their civilisation. This is shown in the following\r\nimperfect sketch of their creed--which is Indian, corrupted and\r\ndegenerate.\r\n\r\n“The inhabitants of this country have many fabulous stories, which shall\r\nbe briefly mentioned. They acknowledge three deities as riders of the\r\nworld, who are respectively named, _Batara-guru_, _Sori-pada_, and\r\n_Mangallah-bulang_. The first, say they, bears rule in heaven, is the\r\nfather of all mankind, and partly, under the following circumstances,\r\ncreator of the earth; which from the beginning of time had been\r\nsupported on the head of _Naga-padoha_; but growing weary at length, he\r\nshook his head, which occasioned the earth to sink, and nothing remained\r\nin the world excepting water. They do not pretend to a knowledge of the\r\ncreation of this original earth and water; but say that at the period\r\nwhen the latter covered every thing, the chief deity, _Batara-guru_, had\r\na daughter named _Puti-orla-bulan_, who requested permission to descend\r\nto these lower regions, and accordingly came down on a white owl,\r\naccompanied by a dog; but not being able, by reason of the waters, to\r\ncontinue there, her father let fall from heaven a lofty mountain, named\r\n_Bakarra_, now situated in the _Batta_ country, as a dwelling for his\r\nchild; and from this mountain all other land gradually proceeded. The\r\nearth was once more supported on the three horns of _Naga-padoha_; and\r\nthat he might never again suffer it to fall off, _Batara-guhu_ sent his\r\nson, named, _Layang-layang-mandi_ (literally ‘the dipping swallow’), to\r\nbind him hand and foot. But to his occasionally shaking his head they\r\nascribe the effect of earthquakes. _Puti-orla-bulan_ had afterwards,\r\nduring her residence on earth, three sons and three daughters, from whom\r\nsprang the whole human race.\r\n\r\n“The second of their deities has the rule of the air, betwixt earth and\r\nheaven; and the third that of the earth; but these two are considered as\r\nsubordinate to the first. Besides these, they have as many inferior\r\ndeities as there are sensible objects on earth, or circumstances in\r\nhuman society; of which some preside over the sea, others over rivers,\r\nover woods, over war, and the like. They believe, likewise, in four evil\r\nspirits, dwelling in four separate mountains; and whatever ill befalls\r\nthem they attribute to the agency of one of these demons. On such\r\noccasions they apply to one of their cunning men, who has recourse to\r\nhis art; and by cutting a lemon ascertains which of these has been the\r\nauthor of the mischief, and by what means the evil spirit may be\r\npropitiated; which always proves to be the sacrificing a buffalo, hog,\r\ngoat, or whatever animal the wizard happens on that day to be most\r\ninclined to eat. When the address is made to any of the superior and\r\nbeneficent deities for assistance, and the priest directs an offering of\r\na horse, cow, dog, hog, or fowl, care must be taken that the animal to\r\nbe sacrificed is entirely white.\r\n\r\n“They have also a vague and confused idea of the immortality of the\r\nhuman soul, and of a future state of happiness or misery. They say that\r\nthe soul of a dying person makes its escape through the nostrils, and is\r\nborne away by the wind; to heaven, if of a person who has led a good\r\nlife; but if of an evil-doer, to a great cauldron, where it shall be\r\nexposed to fire until such time as _Batara-guru_ shall judge it to have\r\nsuffered punishment proportioned to its sins; and feeling compassion\r\nshall take it to himself in heaven: that finally the time shall come\r\nwhen the chains and bands of _Naga-padoha_ shall be worn away, and he\r\nshall once more allow the earth to sink; that the sun will be then no\r\nmore than a cubit’s distance from it, and that the souls of those who,\r\nhaving lived well, shall remain alive at the last day, shall in like\r\nmanner go to heaven, and those of the wicked be consigned to the\r\nbefore-mentioned cauldron, intensely heated by the near approach of the\r\nsun’s rays, to be there tormented by a minister of _Batara-guru_, named\r\n_Suraya-guru_, until, having expiated their offences, they shall be\r\nthought worthy of reception into the heavenly regions.”\r\n\r\nThe remaining male figures represent two warriors from Pulo Nias, a\r\nsmall island on the Western coast of Sumatra; the cap and coat of one\r\nbeing made of the fibres from the leaf-stalk of the _gumuti_ palm.\r\n\r\n“The Nias people are remarkable for their docility and expertness in\r\nhandy-craft work, and become excellent house-carpenters and joiners;\r\nand, as an instance of their skill in the arts, they practise that of\r\nletting blood by cupping, in a mode nearly similar to ours. They are\r\nindustrious and frugal, temperate and regular in their habits, but, at\r\nthe same time, avaricious, sullen, obstinate, vindictive, and\r\nsanguinary. Although much employed as domestic slaves (particularly by\r\nthe Dutch) they are always esteemed dangerous in that capacity; a defect\r\nin their character which philosophers will not hesitate to excuse in an\r\nindependent people torn by violence from their country and connexions.\r\nThey frequently kill themselves when disgusted with their situation, or\r\nunhappy in their families, and often their wives at the same time, who\r\nappeared, from the circumstances under which they were found, to have\r\nbeen consenting to the desperate act. They were both dressed in their\r\nbed apparel (the remainder being previously destroyed), and the female,\r\nin more than one instance, that came under notice, had struggled so\r\nlittle, as not to discompose her hair, or remove her head from the\r\npillow. It is said that in their own country they expose their children,\r\nby suspending them in a bag from a tree, when they despair of being able\r\nto bring them up. The mode seems to be adopted with the view of\r\npreserving them from animals of prey, and giving them a chance of being\r\nsaved by persons in more easy circumstances.”--_Marsden’s Sumatra_, p.\r\n476.\r\n\r\nB. The three opium-smokers are Javanese of the lower orders.\r\n\r\nJava differs from Sumatra in its higher standard of civilisation, and in\r\nthe greater extent to which it has been acted upon by Indian influences.\r\nAt one time, these were generally diffused over the island; not,\r\nperhaps, to the utter and absolute extinction of the original Paganism,\r\nbut, still, largely and generally. At present, however, the prevailing\r\ninfluences are Arab, _i.e._, Mahometan; and Mahometanism has superseded\r\nHindúism in all parts of the island, except one interesting\r\nlocality--the range of the Tenggher Mountains.\r\n\r\n“To the eastward of _Surabáya_, and on the range of hills connected with\r\n_Gúnung Dasar_, and lying partly in the district of _Pasúruan_, and\r\npartly in that of _Probolingo_, known by the name of the _Teng’ger_\r\nmountain, we find the remnant of a people still following the Hindu\r\nworship, who merit attention, not only on account of their being the\r\nsole depositaries of the rites and doctrines of that religion existing\r\nat this day on Java, but as exhibiting an interesting singularity and\r\nsimplicity of character.\r\n\r\n“These people occupy about forty villages, scattered along this range of\r\nhills, in the neighbourhood of what is termed the Sandy Sea. The site of\r\ntheir villages, as well as the construction of their houses, is\r\npeculiar, and differ entirely from what is elsewhere observed on Java.\r\nThey are not shaded by trees but built on spacious open terraces, rising\r\none above the other, each house occupying a terrace, and being in length\r\nfrom thirty to seventy, and even eighty feet. The door is invariably in\r\none corner, at the end of the building opposite to that in which the\r\nfire-place is built. The building appears to be constructed with the\r\nordinary roof, having along the front an enclosed veranda or gallery,\r\nabout eight feet broad. The fire-place is built of brick, and is so\r\nhighly venerated that it is considered a sacrilege for any stranger to\r\ntouch it. Across the upper part of the building rafters are run, so as\r\nto form a kind of attic story, in which are deposited the most valuable\r\nproperty and implements of husbandry.\r\n\r\n“The head of the village takes the title of _Peting’ gi_, as in the\r\nlow-lands, and is generally assisted by a _Kabâyan_, both elected by the\r\npeople from their own village. There are four priests who are here\r\ntermed _Dùkuns_ (a term elsewhere only applied to doctors and midwives),\r\nhaving charge of the state records and the sacred books.\r\n\r\n“These _Dùkuns_, who are in general intelligent men, can give no account\r\nof the era when they were first established on these hills; they can\r\nproduce no traditional history of their origin, whence they came, or who\r\nentrusted them with the sacred books, to the faith contained in which\r\nthey still adhere. These, they concur in stating, were handed down to\r\nthem by their fathers, to whose hereditary office of preserving them\r\nthey have succeeded. The sole duty required of them is again to hand\r\nthem down in safety to their children, and to perform the _púja_\r\n(praisegiving), according to the directions they contain. These records\r\nconsist of three compositions, written on the _lontar_-leaf, detailing\r\nthe origin of the world, disclosing the attributes of the Deity, and\r\nprescribing the forms of worship to be observed on different occasions.\r\nWhen a woman is delivered of her first child, the _Dúkun_ takes a leaf\r\nof the _alang_ grass, and scraping the skin of the hands of the mother\r\nand her infant, as well as the ground, pronounces a short benediction.\r\n\r\n“When a marriage is agreed upon, the bride and bridegroom being brought\r\nbefore the _Dúkun_ within the house, in the first place bow with respect\r\ntowards the south, then to the fire-place, then to the earth, and\r\nlastly, on looking up, to the upper story of the house where the\r\nimplements of husbandry are placed. The parties then, submissively\r\nbowing to the _Dúkun_, he repeats a prayer, while the bride washes the\r\nfeet of the bridegroom. At the conclusion of this ceremony, the friends\r\nand family of the parties make presents to each of krises, buffaloes,\r\nimplements of husbandry, &c.; in return for which the bride and\r\nbridegroom respectfully present them with betel-leaf.\r\n\r\n“At the marriage-feast which ensues, the _Dúkun_ repeats two _púja_. The\r\nmarriage is not, however, consummated till the fifth day after the above\r\nceremony. This interval between the solemnities and consummation of\r\nmarriage is termed by them _úndang mántu_; and is in some cases still\r\nobserved by the Javans in other parts of the island, under the name,\r\n_únduh mántu_.\r\n\r\n“At the interment of an inhabitant of _Teng’ger_, the corpse is lowered\r\ninto the grave with the head placed towards the south (contrary to the\r\ndirection observed by the Mahometans), and is guarded from the immediate\r\ncontact of the earth by a covering of bambus and planks. When the grave\r\nis closed, two posts are planted over the body: one erected\r\nperpendicularly on the breast, the other on the lower part of the belly;\r\nand between them is placed a hollowed bambu in an inverted position,\r\ninto which, during successive days, they daily pour a vessel of pure\r\nwater, laying beside the bambu two dishes, also daily replenished with\r\neatables. At the expiration of the seventh day, the feast of the dead is\r\nannounced, and the relations and friends of the deceased assemble to be\r\npresent at the ceremony, and to partake of entertainments conducted in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\n“A figure of about half a cubit high, representing the human form, made\r\nof leaves and ornamented with variegated flowers, is prepared and placed\r\nin a conspicuous situation, supported round the body by the clothes of\r\nthe deceased. The _Dúkun_ then places in front of the garland an\r\nincense-pot with burning ashes, together with a vessel containing water,\r\nand repeats the two _púja_ to fire and water.\r\n\r\n“The clothes of the deceased are then divided among the relatives and\r\nfriends; the garland is burned; another _púja_ is repeated; while the\r\nremains of the sacred water are sprinkled over the feast. The parties\r\nnow sit down to the enjoyment of it, invoking a blessing from the\r\nAlmighty on themselves, their houses, and their lands. No more\r\nsolemnities are observed till the expiration of a thousand days; when,\r\nif the memory of the deceased is beloved and cherished, the ceremony and\r\nfeast are repeated; if otherwise, no further notice is taken of him: and\r\nhaving thus obtained what the Romans call his _justa_, he is allowed to\r\nbe forgotten.\r\n\r\n“Being questioned regarding the tenets of their religion, they replied\r\nthat they believed in a _Déwa_, who was all-powerful; that the name by\r\nwhich the _Déwa_ was designated was _Búmi Trúka Sáng’yáng Dewáta Bátur_,\r\nand that the particulars of their worship were contained in a book\r\ncalled _Pángláwu_, which they presented to me.\r\n\r\n“On being questioned regarding the _ádat_ against adultery, theft, and\r\nother crimes, their reply was unanimous and ready--that crimes of this\r\nkind were unknown to them, and that consequently no punishment was\r\nfixed, either by law or custom; that if a man did wrong, the head of the\r\nvillage chid him for it, the reproach of which was always sufficient\r\npunishment for a man of _Teng’ger_. This account of their moral\r\ncharacter is fully confirmed by the Regents of the districts, under\r\nwhose authority they are placed, and also by the residents. They, in\r\nfact, seem to be almost without crime, and are universally peaceable,\r\norderly, honest, industrious, and happy. They are unacquainted with the\r\nvice of gambling and the use of opium.\r\n\r\n“The aggregate population is about twelve hundred souls; and they\r\noccupy, without exception, the most beautifully rich and romantic spots\r\non Java; a region in which the thermometer is frequently as low as\r\nforty-two. The summits and slopes of the hills are covered with Alpine\r\nfirs, and plants common to an European climate flourish in luxuriance.\r\n\r\n“Their language does not differ much from the Javan of the present\r\nday, though more gutturally pronounced. Upon a comparison of about\r\na hundred words with the Javan vernacular, two only were found to\r\ndiffer. They do not marry or intermix with the people of the\r\nlowlands, priding themselves on their independence and purity\r\nin this respect.”--_Raffles’s History of Java._\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP IV.\r\n\r\nDYAKS OF BORNEO, A. MALES; B. FEMALES.\r\n\r\nThe native, and aboriginal tribes of Borneo, have no general name by\r\nwhich they designate themselves, neither have they a general name for\r\ntheir island; and this is a fact which occurs pretty generally\r\nthroughout the Indian Archipelago. A mere islet, a piece of land visibly\r\nand palpably surrounded by water--takes the name of _pulo_ (_island_);\r\nbut the _larger_ masses like Celebes, Borneo, Sumatra, and (as Mr.\r\nCraufurd writes) each and all of the islands with the single exception\r\nof Borneo, are treated as continents,--so narrow is the knowledge of the\r\ninhabitants and so limited their powers of comprehension and\r\ngeneralisation. Hence, _Borneo_ is an European rather than a native\r\nterm; taken from the name of a particular portion of the island and\r\nextended to the whole. It was first used by Pigafetta, a companion of\r\nMagalhan, during his voyage round the world in 1521. This gave it a\r\ncurrency in Europe which it has maintained ever since.\r\n\r\nAs to the different divisions of the population, they generally take\r\ntheir designation from the name of the stream on which they reside; so\r\nthat when we hear of such tribes as the Sarebas, the Lundu, the\r\nSakarran, &c., we may safely conclude that rivers so called form their\r\nseveral occupancies.\r\n\r\nThe natives, then, have no general name by which they designate\r\nthemselves collectively. But _we_ have. _We_--_i.e._, the\r\nEuropeans--call them _Dyaks_. _Dyak_ is a Malay word--much such\r\na word as _Savage_, or _Barbarian_--so that expressions like _Dyak_,\r\n_Sarebas_ (the _savages of the Sarebas_), &c., are only partially\r\nnative--partially native and partially Malay.\r\n\r\nThe Malay origin of the word indicates the existence of a Malay\r\npopulation in, or in the neighbourhood of, the island; a Malay\r\npopulation as well as a native. And such is the case. Over and above the\r\nproper aborigines, we find in Borneo, Chinese from China, Bugis from the\r\nIsland of Celebes, and (as aforesaid) Malays from the Malayan Peninsula\r\nand Sumatra.\r\n\r\nIt is the aborigines, however, who alone are represented in the group\r\nbefore us--the Dyaks as opposed to the Malays. And the particular Dyak\r\ndivision is _not_ the one with which an Englishman is the most\r\nfamiliar. The Sarebas Dyaks, the Lundu Dyaks, the Sakarran Dyaks, &c.,\r\nare the best known to us, inasmuch as it is those who come in contact\r\nwith the Rajahship of Sarawak, and the parts under the influence of Sir\r\nJames Brooke. But the Dyaks before us come from the south and the\r\nsouth-east, rather than from the north-west and west, and from the Dutch\r\nparts of the island rather than from the English.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of Borneo belong to the great Malay family, so that they\r\nare essentially the same as the aborigines of Sumatra and Java, &c. But\r\nthey have this important characteristic; they have been the least\r\ntouched by either Indian or Arabic influences. They are the least Hindu,\r\nthe least Mahometan, the most Pagan. Neither have they any alphabet; at\r\nthe same time, some vestiges of Indian culture undoubtedly exist.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak of Borneo is the Malay in his most unmodified and primitive\r\ncondition, and it is amongst the Dyaks of Borneo that the characteristic\r\ncustoms are to be found. They are divided into, probably, 100 different\r\ntribes, with, probably, 100 dialects; so far are they from the\r\norganisation of a concentrated political power. As some tribes, however,\r\nare more powerful than others, and as such tribes encroach and conquer,\r\nthe tendency towards consolidation exists.\r\n\r\nOf such tribes, the most important are the Kayans, occupants of the\r\ncentral part of the island, cultivators of the soil, domesticators of\r\nanimals, forgers of iron. They are a dominant and encroaching\r\npopulation; the Kanawit, and the other tribes more immediately allied,\r\nbeing their tributaries. The names which they give to both the other\r\nDyaks and the Malays, are derisive and insulting; and other\r\ncircumstances besides this show the extent to which they are a proud,\r\nself-respecting population. Their dignity of manner and deportment is\r\nfavourably contrasted with the comparative servility of the Malays. As\r\nto their morals, the accounts are conflicting. The utter absence of\r\nfemale chastity, affirmed by Mr. Law, is denied by Mr. Burns, whose\r\nopportunities for acquiring knowledge seem to have been the better, but\r\nwho writes somewhat in the spirit of an advocate and admirer. The same\r\nauthor considers that their taste for head-hunting has been exaggerated;\r\nat any rate, the custom of handing down heads from generation to\r\ngeneration, as honourable heirlooms, wants confirmation, and besides\r\nthis, has certain positive facts against it. When two of their chiefs\r\nchanged their residence, an accumulation of 400 skulls was thrown away,\r\ninstead of being removed with care and honour. Human sacrifices, on the\r\nother hand, are admitted by Mr. Burns to exist; with the reservation\r\nthat the practice decreases, and that the victim is a member of some\r\nother tribe.\r\n\r\nIt was from the parts about the Kayan river that they began their\r\nconquests. Successful in holding their own, they suffer from disease\r\nrather than war. At intervals of twelve or fifteen years, the small-pox\r\nrages as an epidemic; whilst fever, ague, dysentery, and rheumatism, are\r\nendemic. To tattoo the body, to bore and stretch the ears, to wear\r\npendant ear-rings of twenty ounces, so that the ears and breasts meet,\r\nare the more characteristic elements of the Kayan cosmesis. In the first\r\nof these operations the performer pricks the pattern with a needle, and\r\nthen engrains the smoke of a dammer torch; so that the process is\r\npartially that of the simple tattoo, and partially that of inustion.\r\nMutual friendships or brotherhoods, are ratified by the not unusual\r\nceremony of mixing blood. This Mr. Burns considers as peculiar to the\r\nKayan amongst the populations of Borneo. That of drawing omens from the\r\nflight of birds is common to them and the other tribes.\r\n\r\nAfter death, the body is kept in the house from four to eight days.\r\nTorches are kept burning beside the coffin which contains it; and if one\r\nof them go out, bad luck is augured from its extinction. For four or\r\nfive days, too, after the removal of the corpse, they are still kept\r\nalight. Previous, however, to the removal, a feast is prepared; some of\r\nthe food being placed beside the coffin, whilst the remainder regales\r\nthe relatives of the deceased. The mourning of the women is loud,\r\npassionate, and full of gesticulation. They hug the decomposing body;\r\nthey inhale its odours, and finally, they attend it to the place of its\r\nultimate disposal, which is the loft of a small wooden house, built on\r\npillars, about twelve feet high.\r\n\r\nThe burial ceremonies are more elaborate than those which accompany the\r\nbirth or naming of children; those of marriage are the simplest. To\r\nswim, to wrestle, to blow the sumpitan, to use the sword, and to throw\r\nthe spear, are the chief elements in the training of the Kayan\r\nyouth.[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] Burns, in “Journal of the Indian Archipelago.”\r\n\r\nThis notice has contained some remarkable suggestions. What means the\r\nallusion to the head-hunting? No trophy is more honourable among the\r\nDyaks of Borneo, than a human head; the head of a conquered enemy. These\r\nare preserved in the houses as tokens; so that the number of skulls is a\r\nmeasure of the prowess of the possessor. In tribes, where this feeling\r\nbecomes morbid, no young man can marry before he has presented his\r\nfuture bride with a human head, cut off by himself. Hence, for a\r\nmarriage to take place, an enemy must be either found or made.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that this engenders a chronic state of warfare\r\nbetween tribe and tribe; to which, we may add, as another of the\r\nscourges of the Dyak population, the piracy that is practised along the\r\nwhole of the sea-coasts, and on the lower courses of the numerous\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nCannibalism in Sumatra; head-hunting in Borneo--such are the\r\ncharacteristics of two of the more important branches of the Malay\r\nfamily, and they are practices which are manifestly condemnatory to the\r\nmoral character of the nations in which they occur. We must, however,\r\ntake the evidence to their existence as we find it. On the other hand,\r\nit is a good rule to receive with caution all accounts that violate the\r\ncommon feelings of human nature, and to allow ourselves to believe that\r\ncauses, as yet imperfectly understood, modify and diminish practices so\r\nhorrible. That it should be so general as the theory demands is\r\nincompatible with the proportions between the male and female\r\npopulations, which are much the same in Borneo as elsewhere. So it is,\r\nalso, with the express statement of Sir J. Brooke, who says, that the\r\npassion for heads has much diminished amongst certain of the Sarawak\r\ntribes. In one case, an offer of some was refused; the reason alleged\r\nbeing that it would revive fresh sorrows. The parties who thus declined,\r\ngave a favourable account of some of the customs by which the horrors of\r\na Dyak war were abated:--\r\n\r\n“If one tribe claimed a debt of another, it was always demanded, and the\r\nclaim discussed. If payment was refused, the claimants departed, telling\r\nthe others to listen to their birds, as they might expect an attack.\r\nEven after this, it was often the case, that a tribe friendly to each\r\nmediated between them, and endeavoured to make a settlement of their\r\ncontending claims. If they failed, the tribes were then at war.\r\nRecently, however, more places than one have been attacked without due\r\nnotice, and often by treachery. The old custom likewise was, that no\r\nhouse should be set on fire, no paddy destroyed, and that _a naked\r\nwoman_ could not be killed, nor a woman with child. These laudable and\r\npraiseworthy customs have fallen into disuse, yet they give a pleasing\r\npicture of Dyak character, and relieve, by a touch of humanity, the\r\notherwise barbarous nature of their warfare. Then there is what is\r\ncalled the _Babukid, bubukkid, or mode of defiance_, which is appealed\r\nto as a final judgment in disputes about property, and usually occurs in\r\nfamilies when the right to land and fruit-trees comes to be discussed.\r\nEach party then sallies forth in search of a _head_; if only one\r\nsucceed, his claim is acknowledged; if both succeed, the property\r\ncontinues common to both. It is on these occasions that the Dyaks are\r\ndangerous; and perhaps an European, whose inheritance depended on the\r\nissue, would not be very scrupulous as to the means of success. It must\r\nbe understood, however, that the individuals do not go alone, but a\r\nparty accompanies each, or they may send a party without being present.\r\nThe loss of life is not heavy from this cause, and it is chiefly\r\nresorted to by the Singé and Sows, and is about as rational as our\r\ntrials by combat. This babukid must be a check of a permanent sort.\r\n\r\n_Houses._--“With certain of the Dyak tribes the houses are not huts, nor\r\nyet mere dwelling-houses of ordinary dimensions. They hold from one\r\nhundred to two hundred persons each; and are raised above the ground on\r\npiles.\r\n\r\n_Religion._--“The notions of the Dyaks respecting the spiritual world\r\nare in general much confused, and at variance with each other. They\r\nagree, however, in the belief in good and evil spirits. The good spirits\r\nare divided into two classes, viz., spirits of the world above, or of\r\nthe higher regions, who come under the collective denomination of\r\n‘Sengiang;’ and spirits of the lower regions, or more properly, such as\r\nhave their dominion in the waters, in great rivers, and these are called\r\n‘Jata.’ The collective name of the evil spirits is ‘Talopapa’ which word\r\nsignifies, in general, all bad things.\r\n\r\n“It is to be observed here that the Dyaks describe the aspect of the\r\nregions above as similar to the terrestrial world. Mountains, valleys,\r\nstreams, lakes, &c. &c., are found there, as well as here beneath; and\r\nthe dominions of various spirits are bounded by the different streams\r\nand branches of the rivers.”--_From the Rev. T. F. Barker’s “Mythology\r\nof the Dyaks,” Journ. Ind. Archip._, vol. iii. p. 162.\r\n\r\n“In the interior, men are still occasionally sacrificed, principally on\r\nthe death of chiefs, and other considerable persons. In Sirat, the\r\nfurthest inhabited point of the Kapus River, where I some years ago made\r\na journey of investigation, they had a short time before our arrival,\r\nsacrificed two women. An acquaintance who had been present, gave me the\r\nfollowing account of the horrible event:--One morning at Sirat, there\r\ngathered a great number of people, who streamed in on all sides to\r\ncelebrate a great feast. There was firing of guns--the open plain before\r\nthe Kotta (fort) was prepared for the occasion, and adorned with\r\nbranches, flowers, and cloths; a number of hogs were killed; and when,\r\nfinally, by midday, everything had been arranged according to use and\r\nwont, the real objects of the festival were brought forward--two women,\r\nstill young, who had been purchased for the purpose from another race.\r\nThey had to seat themselves on the side of the ready-dug graves, and\r\ncontemplate for some time the noisy rejoicings of the feasters. A lance\r\nof about thirty feet in length was then brought and laid on one of the\r\nvictims. All now hurried to take a part in the impending detestable\r\ndeed. A hundred hands seized the long lance, and the instant the\r\ncustomary sign was given, they threw themselves, amidst the loud\r\nacclamations of the multitude, on the unfortunate wretch, and pierced\r\nher through and through, even transfixing her to the ground. They then\r\ncut off the head of the fallen victim, and carried it during the rest of\r\nthe day, dancing and singing round it. The same fate also befel her\r\nunfortunate companion. Those who are thus offered become, in their\r\nbelief, in the other world, slaves of the deceased friend to whose\r\nmemory they are offered.”--_From “Some Remarks on the Dyaks of\r\nBanjarmassing,” in the Journ. of the Ind. Archip._, vol. i., p. 30.\r\n\r\nThe blow-pipe, with which so many of the figures before us are\r\nfurnished, is called, in the native language, _sumpitan_. It is made of\r\nthe wood of the palm, bored with the greatest possible nicety. The\r\narrows, which are from four to six inches long, fit the bore, and are\r\npoisoned--at least with some of the tribes. At twenty yards the\r\n_sumpitan_ is sure to hit; at one hundred it attains its longest range.\r\nSince the ones before us have been in England, more than one _amateur_\r\nhas tried them--both with the Dyak arrows, and with little pellets of\r\nclay. They have succeeded in bringing down sparrows from the house-tops\r\nwith the latter. The aim is sure, and a little practice accomplishes it.\r\n\r\nThe male in the sailor’s dress is a Philippine Islander, who spoke the\r\nIloco language. The female is a half-blood Spanish and Manilla-Indian.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP V.\r\n\r\nA.--ISLANDERS OF THE LOUISIADE ARCHIPELAGO--PAPUANS. (_p._ 91)\r\n\r\nA. THE PAPUANS. B. AUSTRALIANS.\r\n\r\nWhen we move eastwards from the more eastern of the Moluccas we reach\r\nNew Guinea, of which the very name suggests the likelihood of a change\r\nin the character of the population. How did it arise? Much in the same\r\nway that such a term as _West Indies_ did. There was something in the\r\nnew country which reminded the discoverers of an old one. Now the large\r\nisland under notice reminded the early voyagers of the coast of _Guinea_\r\non the western side of Africa. Why? Because they found there a\r\npopulation of _Blacks_; a population that reminded them of the negro; a\r\npopulation unlike the Malay tribes of islands westward.\r\n\r\nA. _New Guinea._ This is anything but a native name; indeed, it is a\r\nname that no New Guinea men know anything about.\r\n\r\nJust what occurred in Borneo, occurs here. There is no _general_ name at\r\nall; neither one for the island itself, nor one for the population of\r\nit--no _native_ name at least.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a Malay one. The word _Papua_ means _frizzly-haired_.\r\nOriginally and, more properly, applied to occupants of the north-west\r\ncoast, it has since been extended--for the purposes of Ethnology at\r\nleast--to a whole family. Hence, the Papuan stock contains, not only the\r\ninhabitants of New Guinea, but those of the islands to the east, and\r\nsouth thereof--the Louisiade Archipelago, New Britain, New Ireland, New\r\nHanover, Solomon’s Isles, New Hebrides, Loyalty Isles, and New\r\nCaledonia.\r\n\r\nNo part of the world is less known than these Papuan islands--the\r\ninterior of New Guinea being as much a mystery as the interior of\r\nAfrica. There are certain points, however, on which attention has been\r\nconcentrated. Thus--\r\n\r\n_a._ The western coast of New Guinea itself has been described, more or\r\nless incompletely, by the Dutch.\r\n\r\n_b._ The south-eastern part, along with the islands of Torres Straits,\r\nhas been surveyed by H.M.S. the Fly.\r\n\r\n_c._ The Louisiade Archipelago, &c., by H.M.S. Rattlesnake.\r\n\r\n_d._ The parts about Tanna, Mallicollo, and New Caledonia, by Captain\r\nErskine.\r\n\r\nThe figures before us are from drawings made on the spot by Mr. Huxley,\r\nnaturalist to the Rattlesnake, and as they were from the pencil of an\r\nanatomist as well as an artist they may be relied on as characteristic.\r\nThe chief notices are from Mr. M‛Gillivray’s “Voyage of the\r\nRattlesnake.”\r\n\r\nThe Louisiade houses (or huts) in their simplest form consist of a roof\r\nof palm-leaves on four wooden uprights, each of which pierces a round\r\npiece of wood. This prevents rats and vermin from finding their way\r\nupwards and into the dwelling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe larger and more elaborate contain several families--the following\r\nbeing a section of the part occupied. In parts subject to inundation\r\nthey stand upon high props--upon _piles_ as it were. This mode of\r\nbuilding is common in New Guinea, on certain islands of the Indian\r\nArchipelago, the more swampy parts of inter-tropical America; like\r\nadaptations occurring in like localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNext to the domestic architecture that of their canoes deserves\r\nattention. These, always, or almost always, are built without\r\nriggers--sometimes with a sort of stage or platform projecting from the\r\nsides, the structure of a raft being superadded to that of a boat. The\r\nsailing vessels take the following form. Less nautical than the\r\nMalays--the Papuan family is more so than the Australian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith some varieties the hair is far more elaborately dressed than with\r\nthose of the present group; being twisted into long curls, likened to\r\nthe thrums of a mop, stiffened with oil, and washed in alkaline leys,\r\nwhich give a red tinge. When this kind of ornamentation attains its\r\nfullest development, the frizzled mass of strong and stiffened hair\r\nmakes the owner unable to lie down without disarranging his head-dress.\r\nIn this case a neck-pillow becomes necessary; just as it does with\r\ncertain tribes of Africa, with whom the care of these head-gear is one\r\nof the primary employments of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe chief weapons are the bow and arrow, their political organisation of\r\nthe lowest and simplest kind; that of small tribes living in a state of\r\nchronic hostility with each other. Woven cloth they have none. On the\r\nother hand they show some skill in the art of pottery. In New Guinea, at\r\nleast, they defend their soil with tenacity and resolution, eschewing\r\nEuropean intercourse. In the more southern and smaller islands, however,\r\nthis is less the case than in the more northern and larger ones. They\r\ncontrast more favourably with the Australians than with the Malays.\r\n\r\nBut little is known of their languages.\r\n\r\nThe islands of Torres Strait, even when they lie nearest to the coast of\r\nAustralia, are not Australian, but Papuan, so that the following\r\nextracts from the “Voyage of the Fly” apply to a population allied to\r\none under notice--allied, but not identical.\r\n\r\nIn _Darnley Island_ the natives “were fine, active, well-made fellows,\r\nrather above the middle height, of a dark brown or chocolate colour.\r\nThey had frequently almost handsome faces, aquiline noses, rather broad\r\nabout the nostril, well-shaped heads, and many had a singularly Jewish\r\ncast of features. The hair was frizzled, and dressed into long pipe-like\r\nringlets, smeared sometimes with ochre, sometimes left of its natural\r\nblack colour; others had wigs not to be distinguished from the natural\r\nhair, till closely examined. The septum narium was bored, but there was\r\nseldom anything worn in it. Most of their ears were pierced all round\r\nwith small holes, in which pieces of grass were stuck, and in many the\r\nlobe was torn and hanging down to the shoulder. Their only scars were\r\nthe faint oval marks on the shoulder. The hair of their bodies and limbs\r\ngrew in small tufts, giving the skin a slightly woolly appearance. They\r\nwere entirely naked, but frequently wore ornaments made of\r\nmother-of-pearl shells, either circular or crescent-shaped, hanging\r\nround their necks. Occasionally, also, we saw a part of a large shell,\r\napparently a cassis, cut into a projecting shield-shape, worn in front\r\nof the groin. The women wore a petticoat round the waist, reaching\r\nnearly to the knees, formed of strips of leaves sewn on to a girdle.\r\nThese formed a very efficient covering, as one or two were worn over\r\neach other. The grown-up woman’s petticoat, or nessoor, was formed, we\r\nafterwards found, of the inside part of the large leaves of a\r\nbulbous-rooted plant, called by them teggaer, of which, each strip was\r\nan inch broad. The girl’s nessoor was made of much narrower strips from\r\nthe inside of the leaf of the plantain, which they called cabbow.\r\n\r\n“The younger women were often gracefully formed, with pleasing\r\nexpressions of countenance, though not what we should consider handsome\r\nfeatures. The girls had their hair rather long, but the women had almost\r\nall their hair cut short, with a bushy ridge over the top, to which\r\nthey, singularly enough, gave the same name as to pieces of\r\ntortoise-shells, namely, kaisu. Many of the elder women had their heads\r\nshaved quite smoothly, and we never saw a woman wearing a wig, or with\r\nthe long ringlets of the men. At our first landing, all the younger\r\nwomen and girls kept in the back-ground, or hid themselves in the bush.\r\nOn strolling to the back of the huts, we found a small native path,\r\nalong which we went a short distance till we came to a rude fence in\r\nfront of a plantain-ground, where the men objected to our going further,\r\nand we heard the voices of the women among the trees beyond.\r\n\r\n“There were four huts at this spot, all bee-hive shaped, sixteen feet in\r\ndiameter, and as much in height. They stood in small court-yards,\r\npartially surrounded by fences formed of poles of bamboo, stuck upright\r\nin the ground, close together, and connected by horizontal rails, to\r\nwhich they were tied by withies. Inside the huts were small platforms\r\ncovered with mats, apparently bed-places; and over head were hung up\r\nbows and arrows, clubs, calabashes, rolls of matting, and bundles\r\napparently containing bones, which they did not like our examining.\r\nOutside the huts were one or two small open sheds, consisting merely of\r\na raised flat roof, to sit under in the shade, and a grove of very fine\r\ncocoa-nut trees surrounded the houses.”\r\n\r\nThe arms of the natives were the bow and arrow, and in holding the\r\nformer, especial care was taken that the part of the wood which was\r\nuppermost as the tree grew, should be uppermost when used as a weapon.\r\nRough imitations of the human figure were common; but whether they\r\nserved as idols or not was uncertain. The use of tobacco was general.\r\nOn the part of the females, the reserve and decorum of manner formed a\r\nstriking contrast with the very different habits of the Polynesians.\r\n\r\nB. _The Australians._--These are taken from life; two natives of the\r\nparts about Cape York having been taken up in an English vessel and\r\nbrought with it to England. They passed a fortnight under the same\r\nroof with Mr. Thomson, and were well observed by both the artists\r\nengaged on the figures, and the present writer. The thinness of the\r\nlegs is by no means exaggerated. It is just what the plates of Dr.\r\nPrichard’s “Varieties of Man” make it. On the other hand, the chest\r\nwas well developed, and the arms comparatively--though only\r\ncomparatively--strong. They told the story of their being on board the\r\nship that brought them over, in dumb show, but they told it in a way\r\nthat the most consummate professional actor might admire. But this was\r\nabout all the talent they showed.\r\n\r\nThey ran neither faster nor slower than the Englishman they came in\r\ncontact with; but swam as adepts. By no means insensible to such\r\nkindnesses as they received, they evinced quite as much kindness to\r\ntheir English house-mates as they did to one another. So silent, indeed,\r\nwere they, that until we took a vocabulary of their language, we thought\r\nthat they belonged to two different tribes who had carried their\r\nhostility with them across the Pacific, and nourished it in Sydenham.\r\nSmoking, or rather swallowing smoke, was their chief delight.\r\n\r\nTom, the livelier and less saturnine of the two, has a throwing-stick in\r\nhis hand, which he is about to project.\r\n\r\nIn the group of two he re-appears. When Dick, the gloomier, had a\r\nheadache, Tom could scarcely be withheld from scarifying his temples\r\nwith such pieces of glass or flint as he could pick up.\r\n\r\nDick and Tom are Northern Australians--Northern Australians from the\r\nparts about Cape York.\r\n\r\nObserve the points of difference and likeness between them and the\r\nLouisiade Papuans. As both are dark-skinned, they have been dealt with\r\nas branches of one and the same family; for which a name (or rather a\r\npair of names) derived from the Greek has been applied--_Melanesian_ and\r\n_Kelnonesian_. _Nesos_ means _island_; _kelnos, dark_; _melas\r\n(melan-os), black_. The latter compound is the better. They are\r\ncertainly dark coloured; and it is equally certain that both New Guinea\r\nand Australia are islands. The exact relationship, however, is less\r\ncertain. Nevertheless, the name _Kelnonesian_ is adopted.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Papuan contrasts favourably with the\r\nAustralian; the latter being the better known of the two.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the different Australian languages have long\r\nbeen known and definitely insisted upon.\r\n\r\nLess marked differences in frame and physiognomy between the different\r\nAustralian tribes, have also been long known and definitely insisted\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nDifferences of customs and manners have been similarly noticed and\r\nconsidered. Notwithstanding all this, however, there is no opinion more\r\ngenerally admitted than the fundamental unity of the Australian\r\npopulation from Swan River to Botany Bay, from the Gulf of Carpentaria\r\nto Bass’s Straits. Captain Grey, Schurman, Teichelman, and all who have\r\ndevoted average attention to the language, have given their evidence to\r\nthis; and they have supplied facts of various kinds, of their own\r\ncollection, towards the proof of it. No man is less inclined to disturb\r\nthis view than the present writer.\r\n\r\nAs to the physical conformation of the Australians, I believe that it is\r\nso uniform throughout the island, that it has never been made the basis\r\nof a division;--indeed I am inclined to believe that the _similarity_ of\r\nexternal appearance has been over-rated; nevertheless, it is certain\r\nthat there are deviations from the general slim and underfed condition\r\nof the body; and (which is of more importance), from the usual straight\r\ncharacter of the hair. Such is the case, according to Mr. Earl, with the\r\ntrepang fishers of Arnhem Bay. Then as to the hair--with the Jaako, or\r\nCroker Island tribe, it is coarse and bushy (the whiskers being thick,\r\nand curly) and so short, crisp, and abundant about the breast and\r\nshoulders as to conceal the skin; whereas, on the other hand, the Oitbo,\r\nor Bidjenelumbo, have straight silky hair, arched eyebrows, fair\r\ncomplexion, and occasionally the oblique eye.\r\n\r\nThe lowest form of humanity has been sought for in Australia, whilst the\r\nphysical condition of the country and the absence of those animals and\r\nherbs that supply human food, have made it a likely quarter to exhibit\r\nit. Whether, however, so low a rank in the scale of human development\r\nbe, upon the whole, a fact or exaggeration, it is certain that, upon\r\nseveral points, there has been considerable over-statement. One sample\r\nof this sort is the accredited opinion as to the absolute incapacity of\r\nthe Australian of forming even the rudest elements of a mythology--an\r\nopinion which engenders the notion that their intellects are too\r\nsluggish for even the evolution of a superstition.\r\n\r\nThat this was not the case was indicated some years back by Captain\r\nGrey, and that there is _some_ exponent of the religious feeling in the\r\nshape of a rude form of shamanism, has been shown in the account of the\r\nAmerican Exploring Expedition; where the first published details of the\r\nAustralian mythology, if so it may be called, are to be found:--“It is\r\nnot true, however, as has been frequently asserted, that the natives\r\nhave no idea of a Supreme Being, although they do not allow this idea to\r\ninfluence their actions. The Wellington tribes, at least, believe in the\r\nexistence of a Deity called _Baiamai_, who lives on an island beyond the\r\ngreat sea to the East. His food is fish, which come up to him from the\r\nwater when he calls them. Some of the natives consider him the maker of\r\nall things, while others attribute the creation of the world to his son\r\n_Burambin_. They say of him, that _Baiamai_ spoke, and _Burambin_ came\r\ninto existence. When the missionaries first came to Wellington, the\r\nnatives used to assemble once a year, in the month of February, to dance\r\nand sing a song in honour of _Baiamai_. This song was brought there from\r\na distance by strange natives, who went about teaching it. Those who\r\nrefused to join in the ceremony were supposed to incur the displeasure\r\nof the god. For the last three years the custom has been discontinued.\r\nIn the tribe on Hunter’s River, there was a native famous for the\r\ncomposition of these songs or hymns; which, according to Mr. Threlkeld,\r\nwere passed from tribe to tribe, to a great distance, till many of the\r\nwords became at last unintelligible to those who sang them.\r\n\r\n“_Dararwirgal_, a brother of _Baiamai_, lives in the far west. It was he\r\nwho lately sent the small-pox among the natives, for no better reason\r\nthan that he was vexed for want of a tomahawk. But now he is supposed to\r\nhave obtained one, and the disease will come no more. The _Bálumbal_ are\r\na sort of angels, who are said to be of a white colour, and to live on a\r\nmountain at a great distance to the south-east: their food is honey, and\r\ntheir employment is to do good ‘like the Missionaries.’\r\n\r\n“It is possible that some of these stories owe their origin to\r\nintercourse with the whites, though the great unwillingness which the\r\nnatives always evince to adopt any customs or opinions from them,\r\nmilitates against such a supposition. But a being who is, beyond\r\nquestion, entirely the creation of Australian imagination, is one who is\r\ncalled in the Wellington dialect, _Wandong_; though the natives have\r\nlearned from the whites to apply to him the name of devil. He is an\r\nobject not of worship, but merely of superstitious dread. They describe\r\nhim as going about under the form of a black man of superhuman stature\r\nand strength. He prowls at night through the woods around the\r\nencampments of the natives, seeking to entrap some unwary wanderer, whom\r\nhe will seize upon; and, having dragged him to his fire, will there\r\nroast and devour him. They attribute all their afflictions to his\r\nmalevolence. If they are ill, they say _Wandong_ has bitten them. No one\r\ncan see this being but the _nújargir_, or conjurors, who assert that\r\nthey can kill him, but that he always returns to life. He may, however,\r\nbe frightened away by throwing fire at him (though this statement seems\r\ninconsistent with that respecting his invisibility), and no native will\r\ngo out at night without a firebrand to protect him from the demon.\r\n\r\n“There is some difference in the accounts given of this character. By\r\nthe tribe of Hunter’s River he is called _Koin_ or _Koen_. Sometimes,\r\nwhen the Blacks are asleep, he makes his appearance, seizes upon one of\r\nthem and carries him off. The person seized endeavours in vain to cry\r\nout, being almost strangled. At daylight, however, _Koin_ disappears,\r\nand the man finds himself conveyed safely to his own fireside. From this\r\nit would appear that the demon is here a sort of personification of the\r\nnightmare,--a visitation to which the natives, from their habits of\r\ngorging themselves to the utmost when they obtain a supply of food, must\r\nbe very subject.\r\n\r\n“At the _Muruya_ River the devil is called _Túlugal_. He was described\r\nto us, by a native, as a black man of great stature, grizzled with age,\r\nwho has very long legs, so that he soon overtakes a man; but very short\r\narms, which brings the contest nearer an equality. This goblin has a\r\nwife who is much like himself; but still more feared, being of a cruel\r\ndisposition, with a cannibal appetite, especially for young children. It\r\nwould hardly be worth while to dwell upon these superstitions, but they\r\nseem to characterise so distinctly the people, at once timid, ferocious,\r\nand stupid, who have invented them.\r\n\r\n“Their opinions with regard to the soul vary: some assert that the whole\r\nman dies at once, and nothing is left of him; others are of opinion that\r\nhis spirit still survives, but upon this earth, either as a wandering\r\nghost, or in a state of _metempsychosis_, animating a bird or other\r\ninferior creature. But the most singular belief is one which is found at\r\nboth Port Stephens and Swan River, places separated by the whole breadth\r\nof the Australian continent. This is, that white people are merely\r\nblacks who have died, passed to a distant country, and having there\r\nundergone a transformation, have returned to their original homes. When\r\nthe natives see a white man who strongly resembles one of their deceased\r\nfriends, they give him the name of the dead person, and consider him to\r\nbe actually the same being.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to take an exact measure of the extent to which one\r\nsuperstition is grosser than another;--hence, all that can be said\r\nrespecting the Pantheon, of which _Baiamai_ and _Wandong_ are portions,\r\nis that it is as low in the scale of mythologies as any that has fallen\r\nunder the notice of the writer.\r\n\r\n_Incomplete Numeration of the Australians._--The import of an Australian\r\nhaving no more than the three, four, or five first numerals, and being\r\nthereby as unable to count the number of the fingers of his hands, as\r\nthat of the hair of his head, is less equivocal. It speaks, at once, to\r\na _minimum_ amount of intellectual power. Nevertheless, the same\r\ninability occurs elsewhere; especially in certain languages of South\r\nAmerica. The only vocabulary of Australia where the numerals run beyond\r\nfive, is that of King George’s Sound, as given in Mitchell’s Australia.\r\n\r\nThe political constitution (if so it may be called) of the Australians\r\nis preeminently simple, exhibiting a society of families rather than of\r\ntribes; and of the facts connected with the evidence in favour of the\r\nunity of the Australian division of mankind is the remarkable\r\ndistribution of families bearing the same name. The principal of these\r\nare the Ballaroke, the Tdondarup, the Ngotok, the Nagarnook, the\r\nNogonyuk, the Mongalung, and the Narrangar. Now, persons bearing one or\r\nother of these names, may be found in parts of the country five hundred\r\nmiles apart. Nor does this appear to be the effect of migration, since\r\neach tribe is limited by the jealousy of its neighbours to its own\r\nhunting-ground, beyond which it seldom passes.\r\n\r\nPolygamy in Australia is what we find, and expect to find. The practice\r\nof circumcision is what we find, perhaps, without expecting it. The\r\nhabit of the children taking the name of the mother, will occur again in\r\nthe south of India. The rule that a man cannot marry a woman of his own\r\nfamily-name will also re-appear, and that amongst the Indians of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n_The Kobong._--“Each family among the Australians adopts some animal or\r\nplant, as a kind of badge or armorial emblem, or, as they call it, its\r\n_kobong_. A certain mysterious connection exists between a family and\r\nits kobong, so that a member of the family will not kill an animal, or\r\npluck any plant of the species to which his kobong belongs, except\r\nunder particular circumstances. This institution again, which in some\r\nrespects resembles the Polynesian _tabú_, though founded on a different\r\nprinciple, has its counterpart in the customs of the native Americans.\r\nCaptain Gray observes, citing Mr. Gallatin, that among the Hurons, the\r\nfirst tribe is that of the bear; the two others, those of the wolf and\r\nturtle. The Iroquois have the same divisions, and the turtle family is\r\ndivided into the great and little turtle. The Sioux are named on a\r\nsimilar principle. According to Major Long, one part of the\r\nsuperstitions of these savages consists in each man having some totem,\r\nor favourite spirit, which he believes to watch over him. The totem\r\nassumes the shape of some beast, and therefore they never kill or eat\r\nthe animal whose form they suppose their totem to bear.”\r\n\r\n_The ceremony of initiation._--“When the boys arrive at the age of\r\npuberty (or about fourteen), the elders of a tribe prepare to initiate\r\nthem into the duties and privileges of manhood. Suddenly, at night, a\r\ndismal cry is heard in the woods, which the boys are told is the _Bubu_\r\ncalling for them. Thereupon all the men of the tribe (or rather of the\r\nneighbourhood) set off for some secluded spot previously fixed upon,\r\ntaking with them the youths who are to undergo the ceremony. The exact\r\nnature of this is not known, except that it consists of superstitious\r\nrites, of dances representing the various pursuits in which men are\r\nengaged, of sham fights, and trials designed to prove the\r\nself-possession, courage, and endurance of the neophytes. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that there is some variation in the details of the ceremony, in\r\ndifferent places; for among the coast tribes, one of these is the\r\nknocking out of an upper front tooth, which is not done at Wellington,\r\nand farther in the interior. But the nature and object of the\r\ninstitution appear to be everywhere the same. Its design unquestionably\r\nis, to imprint upon the mind of the young man the rules by which his\r\nfuture life is to be regulated; and some of these are so striking, and,\r\nunder the circumstances, so admirable, that one is inclined to ascribe\r\nthem to some higher state of mental cultivation than now prevails among\r\nthe natives. Thus, the young men, from the time they are initiated, till\r\nthey are married, are forbidden to approach or speak to a female. They\r\nmust encamp at a distance from them at night, and if they see one in the\r\nway, must make a long detour to avoid her. Mr. Watson told me that he\r\nhad often been put to great inconvenience in travelling through the\r\nwoods, with a young man for his guide, as such a one could never be\r\ninduced to approach an encampment where there were any women. The moral\r\nintent of this regulation is evident.\r\n\r\n“Another rule requires the young men to pay implicit obedience to their\r\nelders. As there is no distinction of rank among them, it is evident\r\nthat some authority of this kind is required, to preserve the order and\r\nharmony of social intercourse.\r\n\r\n“A third regulation restricts the youth to certain articles of diet.\r\nThey are not allowed to eat fish, or eggs, or the _emu_, or any of the\r\nfiner kinds of opossum and kangaroo. In short, their fare is required to\r\nbe of the coarsest and most meagre description. As they grow older, the\r\nrestrictions are removed, one after another; but it is not till they\r\nhave passed the period of middle age that they are entirely unrestrained\r\nin the choice of food. Whether one purpose of this law be to accustom\r\nthe young men to a hardy and simple style of living may be doubted; but\r\nits prime objects and its result certainly are to prevent the young men\r\nfrom possessing themselves, by their superior strength and agility, of\r\nall the more desirable articles of food, and leaving only the refuse to\r\nthe elders.\r\n\r\n“The ceremony of marriage, which, amongst most nations, is considered so\r\nimportant and interesting, is with this people one of the least\r\nregarded. The woman is looked upon as an article of property, and is\r\nsold or given away by her relatives without the slightest consideration\r\nof her own pleasure. In some cases she is betrothed, or rather promised,\r\nto her future husband in the childhood of both; and in this case, as\r\nsoon as they arrive at a proper age, the young man claims and receives\r\nher. Some of them have four or five wives, and in such a case, they will\r\ngive one to a friend who may happen to be destitute. Notwithstanding\r\nthis apparent laxity, they are very jealous, and resent any freedom\r\ntaken with their wives. Most of their quarrels relate to women. In some\r\ncases, the husband who suspects another native of seducing his wife\r\neither kills or severely injures one or both of them. Sometimes the\r\naffair is taken up by the tribe, who inflict punishment after their own\r\nfashion. The manner of this is another of the singularities of their\r\nsocial system.\r\n\r\n“When a native, for any transgression, incurs the displeasure of his\r\ntribe, their custom obliges him to ‘stand punishment,’ as it is called;\r\nthat is, he stands with a shield, at a fair distance, while the whole\r\ntribe, either simultaneously or in rapid succession, cast their spears\r\nat him. Their expertness generally enables those who are exposed to this\r\ntrial to escape without serious injury, though instances occasionally\r\nhappen of a fatal result. There is a certain propriety even in this\r\nextraordinary punishment, as it is very evident that the accuracy and\r\nforce with which the weapons are thrown will depend very much upon the\r\nopinion entertained of the enormity of the offence.\r\n\r\n“When the quarrel is between two persons only, and the tribe declines to\r\ninterfere, it is sometimes settled by a singular kind of _duello_. The\r\nparties meet in presence of their kindred and friends, who form a circle\r\nround them as witnesses and umpires. They stand up opposite one another,\r\narmed each with a club about two feet long. The injured person has the\r\nright of striking the first blow, to receive which the other is obliged\r\nto extend his head forward, with the side turned partially upwards. The\r\nblow is inflicted with a force commensurate with the vindictive feeling\r\nof the avenger. A white man, with an ordinary cranium, would be killed\r\noutright, but, owing to the great thickness of their skulls, this seldom\r\nhappens with the natives. The challenged party now takes his turn to\r\nstrike, and the other is obliged to place himself in the same posture of\r\nconvenience. In this way the combat is continued; with alternate\r\nbuffets, until one of them is stunned, or the expiation is considered\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n“What are called wars among them may more properly be considered duels\r\n(if this word may be so applied) between two parties of men. One or more\r\nnatives of a certain part of the country, considering themselves\r\naggrieved by the acts of others in another part, assemble their\r\nneighbours to consult with them concerning the proper course to be\r\npursued. The general opinion having been declared for war, a messenger\r\nor ambassador is sent to announce their intention to the opposite party.\r\nThese immediately assemble their friends and neighbours, and all prepare\r\nfor the approaching contest. In some cases, the day is fixed by the\r\nmessenger, in others not; but, at all events, the time is well\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n“The two armies (usually from fifty to two hundred each) meet, and after\r\na great deal of mutual vituperation, the combat commences. From their\r\nsingular dexterity in avoiding or parrying the missiles of their\r\nadversaries, the engagement usually continues a long time without any\r\nfatal result. When a man is killed (and sometimes before), a cessation\r\ntakes place; another scene of recrimination, abuse, and explanation\r\nensues, and the affair commonly terminates. All hostility is at an end,\r\nand the two parties mix amicably together, bury the dead, and join in a\r\ngeneral dance.\r\n\r\n“One cause of hostility among them, both public and private, is the\r\nabsurd idea which they entertain, that no person dies a natural death.\r\nIf a man perishes of disease, at a distance from his friends, his death\r\nis supposed to have been caused by some sorcerer of another tribe, whose\r\nlife must be taken for satisfaction. If, on the other hand, he dies\r\namong his kindred, the nearest relative is held responsible. A native of\r\nthe tribe at Hunter’s River, who served me as a guide, had not long\r\nbefore beaten his own mother nearly to death, in revenge for the loss of\r\nhis brother, who died while under her care. This was not because he had\r\nany suspicions of her conduct, but merely in obedience to the\r\nrequirements of a senseless custom.”\r\n\r\nAnother fact connected with the decease of an Australian deserves\r\nnotice. When one of them dies, those words which are identical with his\r\nname, or, in the case of compounds, with any part of it, cease to be\r\nused; and some synonym is adopted instead; just as if, in England,\r\nwhenever a Mr. _Smith_ departed this life, the parish to which he\r\nbelonged should cease to talk of _blacksmiths_, and say _forgemen_,\r\n_forgers_, or something equally respectful to the deceased, instead.\r\nThis custom reappears in Polynesia, and in South America; Dobrizhoffer’s\r\naccount of the Apibonian custom being as follows:--“The Abiponian\r\nlanguage is involved in new difficulties by a ridiculous custom which\r\nthe savages have of continually abolishing words common to the whole\r\nnation, and substituting new ones in their stead. Funeral rites are the\r\norigin of this custom. The Abipones do not like that anything should\r\nremain to remind them of the dead. Hence appellative words bearing any\r\naffinity with the names of the deceased are presently abolished. During\r\nthe first years that I spent among the Abipones, it was usual to say\r\n_Hegmalkam kahamátek_, when will there be a slaughtering of oxen? On\r\naccount of the death of some Abipon, the word _Kahamátek_ was\r\ninterdicted, and, in its stead, they were all commanded by the voice of\r\na crier to say, _Hemalkam négerkatà_? The word _Nihirenak_, a tiger, was\r\nexchanged for _Apanigehak_; _Peú_, a crocodile, for _Kaeprhak_, and\r\n_Kaáma_, Spaniards, for _Rikil_, because these words bore some\r\nresemblance to the names of Abipones lately deceased. Hence it is that\r\nour vocabularies are so full of blots occasioned by our having such\r\nfrequent occasions to obliterate interdicted words, and insert new\r\nones.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP VI.\r\n\r\n  DANAKIL AND NEGRO OF THE EASTERN COAST OF AFRICA (THE DANAKIL\r\n  LIGHT-COLOURED); FROM THE PARTS BETWEEN THE ENTRANCE TO THE RED SEA\r\n  AND THE HIGHLANDS OF SOUTHERN ABYSSINIA.\r\n\r\nAttention is directed to the Danakil figures. They are African; but they\r\nare not negro. They are Africans from one of the very hottest parts.\r\nThey are other than negro, nevertheless. Their hair is longer than the\r\nnegro’s; their lips thinner; their colour lighter; their nose more\r\naquiline. Travellers who have been struck by their appearance have\r\ncalled them _Caucasians_, by which they mean that they approach the\r\nEuropean type. Others have compared them with the Arabs--others with the\r\nJews; and this has led them further. The coasts of Arabia are not far\r\noff; so why should there not be Arab blood amongst them? This has more\r\nthan once been assumed. The assumption, however, is unnecessary--nay, it\r\nis incorrect. The negro of the next group--the negro from the Delta of\r\nthe Niger, the negro in his most extreme form--is not more truly\r\nindigenous and aboriginal to the soil of Africa than are these Danakil;\r\nwho are not only Africans, in the strictest sense of the term, but also\r\nmembers of a large family, falling into divisions and subdivisions. So\r\nfar are they from being exceptional, or in any respect peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this family are (_a_) the Somauli, on the coast of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, about Cape Guardafui and (_b_) the Gallas, or\r\nIlmorma, a pastoral people spread over a vast area to the south of\r\nAbyssinia, and who so encroach upon that country that they are in a fair\r\nway of reducing it altogether.\r\n\r\nThe Gallas, like the Danakil, and the Danakil, like the Somauli and\r\nGallas, are a pastoral people--pastoral, locomotive, wild, and\r\nintractable--with manners that remind us of the Arab of Asia, the Kaffre\r\nof Southern Africa, or of the Berber of the Desert of Sahara; and it is\r\nthese whom they resemble, more or less closely, in their forms--more or\r\nless closely in their social constitution. Like all such populations,\r\nthey fall into numerous tribes, each under the influence of their chief;\r\nwith the spirit of blood, or pedigree, running strong amongst them.\r\nEvery man belongs to his tribe, or class, and is proud of being attached\r\nto it. Of the Danakil alone, more than fifty of these tribual divisions\r\nare known by name.\r\n\r\nIn respect to creed the Danakil are what the neighbourhood of Arabia\r\nleads us to expect, Mahometans, more or less incompletely converted; and\r\nthis is the general rule for the eastern coast of Africa--the _coast_,\r\nbut not the interior. In the interior we get amongst pagans. On the\r\nother hand, Abyssinia and some of the parts about it are Christian. Dr.\r\nBeke considered that he found traces of a corrupt and displaced\r\nChristianity among the Gallas.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the neighbourhood of Arabia having determined a large\r\nportion of the eastern coast of Africa to Mahometanism explains the\r\nmeaning of the words _Kaffre_, and _Caffraria_, or _Kafferland_.\r\n_Kaffre_, in the mouth of an Arab, means _Infidel_. It means\r\n_Infidel_ not only in the mouth of an Arab, but in that of any\r\nMahometan. In different languages it takes different forms, and is\r\napplied to different populations. In Persia it expressed the old\r\n_Fire-worshippers_, since _Guebre_ is but another form of it. In Cabul\r\nit denotes the occupants of a district to the north of Peshawur, wherein\r\nthe natives still reject Mahometanism, and, so doing, are _Kafirs_,\r\ntheir country being _Kaferistan_. In Turkey it generally means a\r\nChristian--since _Giaour_ is neither more nor less than _Kafir_ in the\r\nmouth of a Turk.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Eastern Africa. Where the Arab influence ceases, the\r\nland of the _Kaffres_ begins.\r\n\r\nOf these Kaffres more may be seen in group VII.\r\n\r\nThe black figure (modelled from life) is evidently more negro than aught\r\nelse. The hair is crisp, to say the least of it, and the skin black; the\r\nopen and patulous character of the nostrils, and their lateral position,\r\nclaim attention. They are by no means exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe youth from whom the figure was taken belonged to the Msegurra tribe;\r\nof which I can only state that it is an occupant of some part of the\r\nback of the coast of Zanzibar, or Mozambique.\r\n\r\nThe present group prepares us for a Kaffre; let it also prepare us for a\r\nnegro one. That all Africans are not negroes may be seen from the\r\nfigures before us. The negro form is by no means universal--not even in\r\nthe hottest parts of Africa--not even between the tropics: it is only in\r\nthe lower levels that the true negro is to be found. Look for him\r\namongst the high pastures of the mountains, look for him even on the hot\r\nbut arid plateaus of the desert, and you search in vain. Tribes with\r\ndark skins you may find, tribes with hair more or less wavy, or\r\nfrizzly, tribes with features heavy, massive, and coarse--but the true\r\nand typical negro, with his short woolly hair, and his thick projecting\r\nlips you will not find. Wherever he is the occupant, the soil is\r\nalluvial, and the heat of the atmosphere is combined with moisture.\r\nWherever the land gets high and dry, the inhabitant is brown rather than\r\nblack, and long-haired rather than frizzly headed. His features, too,\r\nbecome more prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP VII.\r\n\r\nNEGROES,--2. LIGHT-COLOURED. FROM THE LOWER NIGER.\r\n\r\nIn the Delta of the Niger we find the best opportunity for contrasting\r\nthe negro with the European, the black man with the white; inasmuch as\r\nit is in the Delta of the Niger where the points wherein the African\r\ndiffers from the rest of the world are found in the most marked form.\r\nThe climate is tropical (well nigh equatorial), the soil swampy and\r\nalluvial, the atmosphere surcharged with damp warm vapours. Under these\r\nconditions the negro is found in his most extreme form. Let us ask what\r\nit is. In the true and typical negro (the negro from whom the current\r\nnotions of the black man are derived), over and above the colour of the\r\nskin, there is a woolly, cottony, or frizzy head of hair, there is a\r\nyellow tinge over the white of the eye (the sclerotica), and there are\r\nthick lips, with a projecting mouth--a muzzle rather than a mouth, in\r\nits more exaggerated form. This is because the teeth are set obliquely,\r\n_i. e._ they slant somewhat forward. Then there is the forehead, which\r\nis described as being narrow, and retiring, and receding, or sloping\r\nbackwards. There is some exaggeration in this, though upon the whole the\r\nnegro character is well marked; the hair, the skin, and the lips, being\r\nthe chief points. To the notice of these it should be added that the\r\nnose is generally flat and depressed, with the nostrils _thrown out_, so\r\nto say, sideways. Rarely, very rarely indeed, is the bridge sufficiently\r\ncurved to give what is called the _Roman_ or _aquiline_ nose; whilst it\r\nis almost as rare to find a Grecian one, _i. e._ one where the nasal\r\nbones are raised but straight. Then there is the proportion which the\r\ndifferent parts of the face bear to each other. A [34]German writer of\r\neminence as a naturalist, has lately been taking measurements from\r\namongst the negroes of Brazil, and states that instead of the parts\r\nbetween the chin and nose (the nasal portion of the face), and the\r\nforehead forming a third, each, of the whole physiognomy, the forehead\r\nforms _less_ than a third, the nasal part more than the forehead, and\r\nthe chin, &c. more than the nasal; in other words, the lower we go the\r\ngreater the mass of the several parts of the face, and the nearer we\r\napproach the brain, the smaller. I can neither verify nor deny this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n  [34] Burmeister--_The Black Man_, a pamphlet.\r\n\r\nOther points, more or less characteristic, real or supposed, are to be\r\nfound in the relations of the limbs to the trunk--the former being\r\nlonger in proportion to the latter than is usual with Europeans.\r\n\r\nIt is more important, however, to investigate the amount of difference\r\nindicated by the difference of colour, and to do this we must look to\r\nthe structure of the skin. The structure of the negro’s skin differs\r\nfrom that of the white man in degree only, the one containing much, the\r\nother but little colouring matter; this colouring matter being deposited\r\nin a particular layer, called the _mucous layer_, the _stratum\r\nMalpighii_, or the _rete mucosum_. The character of this _mucous layer_,\r\nor _rete mucosum_, is well given in the forthcoming plates, which, along\r\nwith the description, is taken from [35]Kölliker’s Manual. It differs in\r\nsome degree from the one which occurs in the ordinary works on\r\nEthnology.\r\n\r\n  [35] Translated by Messrs. Busk and Huxley for the Sydenham Society.\r\n\r\nThe external integument of all men alike consists of the _cutis_ or true\r\nskin, and the _epidermis_, or scarf-skin, the latter consisting of cells\r\nonly, the former of cells, vessels and nerves.\r\n\r\nAs far as the _cutis_ is concerned, the blackest and whitest of mankind\r\nare alike; so that it is in the scarf-skin or _epidermis_ that the\r\ndifference lies. This consists of two layers, an external and an\r\ninternal.\r\n\r\nThe internal layer is the _rete mucosum_. It lies immediately upon the\r\ntrue skin, and consists solely and wholly of cells, being equally\r\ndestitute of vessels and nerves. Here begin the first discrepancies in\r\nthe opinion of writers. Some deny that it belongs to the epidermis,\r\nlooking upon it as a separate substantive tissue, neither skin nor\r\nscarf-skin, but intermediate to the two. Others find it only in the\r\ncoloured families of mankind. It occurs, however, universally; being of\r\na yellowish-white colour in Europeans, and dark brown or black in\r\nnegroes, Indians, and the so-called dark races. Hence, the real\r\ndifference is not in the existence of an additional tissue, but in a\r\ngreater amount of colouring matter. Similar in respect to the two\r\nlayers of their cutis, similar in respect to the two layers of their\r\nepidermis, the black man and the white differ in the extent to which the\r\nsecond layer of the scarf-skin is charged with a black deposit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figure represents a section through the skin and\r\nscarf-skin of the ball of the thumb; wherein _a_ is the outer layer of\r\nthe epidermis; _b_, the inner, or _rete mucosum_; _c_, and _d_, the\r\ncutis; _e_, glands, ducts, &c.\r\n\r\nThe next gives us the epidermis only--_a_, being the outer; _b_, the\r\ninner layer (_rete mucosum_;) _c_, the cutis, to the outline of which\r\nthe _rete mucosum_ adapts itself.\r\n\r\nIt is in the deepest parts of the inner layer, in the parts more\r\nimmediately in contact with the true skin, that the most colouring\r\nmatter is accumulated. Hence, the horny, or outer part of the epidermis\r\nis white or yellowish, all the world over. A blister, in popular\r\nlanguage, _raises the skin_; in reality, it only raises the outer layer\r\nof the epidermis. Now blisters rise equally _white_ with the African and\r\nwith the European.\r\n\r\nIt is not until after birth that the colouring matter of the second\r\nlayer of the scarf-skin becomes deposited. A negro child is born of\r\nsomewhat deeper red colour than an European, but he is not born black.\r\nThe edges of the nails and the nipple of the breast darken first; the\r\nbody having darkened by the third day, there or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nAs the hue of the skin attains its deepest tinge with the groupe before\r\nus, the structure that exhibits it has been enlarged upon.\r\n\r\nWhat is the moral and social state of these negroes of the Delta of the\r\nNiger? what their habits, customs, and creeds?\r\n\r\nWe cannot follow the account of any observer for these parts, without\r\ndiscovering that, overpowering as is the heat, and swampy as is the\r\nground, unfavourable, in one word, as are the conditions of soil and\r\nclimate, the whole of the low country represented by the groupe before\r\nus teems with human life; neither is there the absence of human\r\nindustry. We first hear of villages of from twenty to thirty, from\r\nthirty to forty, from fifty to seventy huts; to each of which we may\r\ngive, upon an average, some six occupants. Then there are large towns\r\nlike Iboh and Iddah, wherein the inhabitants are counted by the\r\nthousand; where there are regular market-days, and where there is a\r\nking with his court, such as it is. It is with these kings that the\r\ntreaties have to be made against the slave-trade, these kings who, as in\r\nthe late case at Lagos, have disputes as to the “succession”; these\r\nkings who give licenses to trade, and who make the access to the\r\ninterior part of the country practicable or the contrary. There are\r\nkings and viceroys--viceroys with kings over them, so that there is a\r\nsort of feudal chain of vassalage and sovereignty. King Emmery, for\r\ninstance, was, at the time of the Niger Expedition, the chief of a\r\nvillage on the river Nun, himself being a subject to King Boy of Brass\r\nTown. Then there is the kingdom of Iddah, with its subordinate\r\nkingships, whilst Kakanda and Egga are the dependencies of a really\r\nconsolidated monarchy at Sakkatu.\r\n\r\nAt best, however, the African monarch, except in the Mahometan kingdoms,\r\nis but a sorry potentate; a drunken, sensual, slave-dealing polygamist.\r\nWhen Drs. McWilliam and Stanger visited this same King Emmery, his dress\r\nwas a uniform coatee that had belonged to a drummer[36] in some English\r\nregiment, a plain black hat, and a blue cotton handkerchief for the\r\nlower man--a blue cotton handkerchief for drawers, trowsers and\r\nstockings, collectively; the dress of the ordinary natives being limited\r\nto a simple shirt, with a cloth round the middle. In this we get one of\r\nthe measures of the amount of English influence and trade.\r\n\r\n  [36] A drummer’s uniform is a favourite dress elsewhere. In the\r\n  Ethnological Museum at Copenhagen, Professor Thompson can show no\r\n  marriage-garment for a _male_ Esquimaux, although of female\r\n  wedding-gear, and that a truly native and characteristic kind, he has\r\n  abundance. But there are no male equivalents. The reason of this lies\r\n  in the fact of a Danish Drummer’s dress having been left as a sort of\r\n  general property to the community, to be lent or hired, as the case\r\n  may be whenever a marriage ceremony takes place, to the utter\r\n  obliteration of the old costume, and with a great disregard to fit.\r\n\r\nThe huts are of clay, arranged in squares rather than in rows, and when\r\nthe soil is low and liable to be flooded, they are raised some feet from\r\nthe ground on a foundation of wooden pillars, in which case a ladder\r\nleads to the principal opening. The King’s palace is an assemblage of\r\nsuch huts; a miniature town; one side of the square which they form\r\nbeing the “women’s quarters.” Here reside the numerous wives,\r\nhalf-wives, and ex-wives of the sovereign, the number of which is always\r\nconsiderable, since the rank of the man regulates it. The following\r\ntable gives us, in the first column, the names of the different members\r\nof the Court of King Obi of Iboh in 1840; in the others, their age, and\r\nthe numbers of their wives and families--\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------+----+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |                                  |    |   WIVES.  | CHILDREN. |\r\n  |                                  |    +-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |                                  |    | Liv-|     | Liv-|     |\r\n  |                                  |Age.| ing.|Dead.| ing.|Dead.|\r\n  |                                  +----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |1.

Obi’s\r\nestablishment was seen to advantage; for his wives were amused at the\r\nfaces and dresses of the Europeans who visited their lord and master,\r\nand they flocked in swarms to laugh at them. Their mirth then\r\n“brought[37] out about twenty damsels of more mature age, who were\r\nsuperannuated wives, permitted to live within the precincts of the\r\npalace.” What will be the ultimate fate of these old and young, active\r\nand superannuate? Even this--that when the king dies, they will be\r\nsacrificed to his manes.\r\n\r\n  [37] Dr. McWilliam--Medical History of the Niger Expedition.\r\n\r\nThis practice is common throughout the districts under notice. At Old\r\nCalabar, the south-eastern angle of the Delta, the death of a\r\nwell-known chief or caboceer,[38] named Ephraim, caused the death of\r\nsome hundreds of men, women, and children who were immolated at his\r\nburial--decapitation, burning alive, and the administration of the\r\npoison-nut, being the methods resorted to for terminating their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n  [38] From the Portuguese _Cabocero--Captain_.\r\n\r\nAgain, when King Eyeo, father of the present Chief of Creek Town, died,\r\nan eyewitness, who had only arrived just after the completion of the\r\nfuneral rites, informed me that a large pit had been dug, in which\r\nseveral of the deceased’s wives were bound and thrown in, until a\r\ncertain number had been procured; the earth was then thrown over them,\r\nand so great was the agony of these victims, that the ground for several\r\nminutes was agitated with their convulsive throes. So fearful, in former\r\ntimes, was the observance of this barbarous custom, that many towns\r\nnarrowly escaped depopulation.[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] Dr. Daniell on the Natives of Old Calabar, “Transactions of the\r\n  Ethnological Society.”\r\n\r\nThe savage character of the negro warfare is on a level with such\r\npractices as these--the slave trade being the chief incentive to them.\r\nWhen these take place, and when the burial-place of a king is known to\r\nthe enemy, they rifle his grave for his remains; and having obtained his\r\nscull, keep it as a trophy. For this reason the tombs of royalty are\r\nkept concealed.\r\n\r\nBut there is another peculiarity. In more than one part of the western\r\ncoast, the woman serves as a soldier, or even as a captain. In Akkim, on\r\nthe Gold Coast, the notice of a female _colonel_, when first made,\r\nexcited as much incredulity as surprise. The fact, nevertheless, has\r\nbeen confirmed by respectable testimony, by Mr. Duncan, and Captain\r\nForbes, more especially; inasmuch as in the kingdom of Dahomey, there is\r\na whole regiment consisting exclusively of females--a large proportion\r\nbeing the ex-wives of the king. The following song, given on the\r\nauthority of the last-named author, shows the temper and spirit of the\r\nunsexed Amazons:--\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n    “When Yoribah[40] said she could conquer Dahomey;\r\n    When we meet we’ll change their night into day;\r\n            Let the rain fall:\r\n    The season past, the river dries.\r\n          Yoribah and Dahomey!\r\n    Can two rams drink from one calabash?\r\n    The Yoribahs must have been drunk to say\r\n          Dahomey feared them,\r\n          They could conquer Dahomey.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n    “There’s a difference between Gezo and a poor man;\r\n    There’s a difference between Gezo and a rich man.\r\n        If a rich man owned all,\r\n        Gezo would still be king.\r\n    All guns are not alike;\r\n    Some are long, some short, some thick, some thin.\r\n      The Yoribahs must be a drunken nation,\r\n      And thus we will dance before them.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n    “Gezo is king of kings!\r\n    While Gezo lives we have nothing to fear.\r\n      Under him we are lions, not men.\r\n        Power emanates from the king.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n    “Let all eyes behold the king!\r\n    There are not two but one--\r\n              One only, Gezo!\r\n    All nations have their customs,\r\n    But none so brilliant or enlightened,\r\n        As those of Dahomey.\r\n    People from far countries are here:\r\n    Behold all nations, white and black,\r\n        Send their ambassadors.\r\n\r\nAMAZONS’ CHORUS.\r\n\r\n    “With these guns in our hands,\r\n    And powder in our cartouch-boxes,\r\n        What has the king to fear?\r\n    When we go to war, let the king dance,\r\n    While we bring him prisoners and heads.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHORUS.\r\n\r\n    “Let the king grant war speedily!\r\n    Do not let our energies be damped.\r\n    Fire cannot pass through water.\r\n        The king feeds us;\r\n        When we go to war.\r\n          Remember this!\r\n    “We are clothed and fed by Gezo;\r\n    In consequence, our hearts are glad.””\r\n\r\n  [40] A neighbouring kingdom on the East.\r\n\r\nWar and slavery engender each other; war leading to slavery, and slavery\r\nstimulating to war. And slavery takes three forms, all bad--bad, but one\r\nworse than the other two. This is the slavery of the _traders_. An\r\nexpedition is undertaken against some neighbouring tribe, weak enough,\r\nor unprepared enough, to divest the attack of half its danger. Captives\r\nare taken, driven to the coast in groups, shut up in barracoons, and\r\nthen sold for transportation to the new world. It is this form of\r\nslavery that engenders the miseries and atrocities of the middle\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nThe second form is that of simple domestic servitude, wherein the slave,\r\nalthough under constant compulsion, forms a part of his master’s family,\r\nand is ensured against removal from his native soil.\r\n\r\nThe third is like that of the _Nexi_ of ancient Rome, and occurs when a\r\nnegro, in order to raise a particular sum of money, sells himself as a\r\nlabourer for a certain period--pawns his body, so to say, or borrows\r\nmoney on himself.\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice is on the same low level as the other\r\ninstitutions; the punishments being cruel, and the rules of evidence\r\nbarbarous.[41] Two methods, as may be expected, predominate, the ordeal\r\nand the torture. The commonest form of the latter is “what is called\r\ntying Guinea-fashion. In this the arms are closely drawn together behind\r\nthe back, by means of a cord tied tightly round them, about midway\r\nbetween the elbows and shoulders. A piece of wood to act as a rack\r\nhaving been previously introduced, is then used so as to tighten the\r\ncord, and so intense is the agony, that one application is generally\r\nsufficient to occasion the wretch so tortured to confess to anything\r\nthat is required of him.”\r\n\r\n  [41] From the United Service Journal, November, 1850.\r\n\r\nAnother form consists in “tying the head and hands, in such a way that\r\nby turning the body backwards, they may be drawn together by the cords\r\nemployed. Another is securing the wrist or ankle to a block of wood by\r\nan iron staple. By means of a hammer any degree of pressure may thus be\r\napplied.”\r\n\r\nThe chief form of ordeal is, what is called on the Gold Coast, the\r\n_dhoom_ test, but which appears and reappears all along the\r\nintertropical parts of Western Africa. The _dhoom_ is a kind of wood\r\nwith poisonous and emetic properties. The innocent man drinks and ejects\r\nit: the guilty one drinks and dies. In Old Calabar the seeds of an\r\naquatic legume replace the _dhoom_ wood. Unless emetic, they are\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nPartaking of the nature of the ordeal, as a means of investigation in\r\ncriminal matters, is the application to priest, sorcerer, medicine-man,\r\nor _Fetish_-man; but as the principles of belief that this practice\r\ninvolves one illustrated in the Zulu group, we only make a passing\r\nallusion to it. The notice, too, of the festivals as connected with\r\nreligion, will similarly stand over.\r\n\r\nWhat applies to one of the negro populations of the western coast,\r\napplies, more or less, to all. There are, of course, differences,\r\nnevertheless the general character of the social and political\r\ninstitutions, of their habits and superstitions, is alike; so that the\r\ndescription of one tribe is the description of several others besides;\r\nthe chief distinctions consist in the creeds. I do not mean by this that\r\nthe particular form of the native and indigenous superstition is of much\r\nimportance. They are all low and debasing, and even when an African form\r\nof faith aspires to the character of a mythology, it is a mythology of\r\nan unpoetical, unimaginative, and poverty-stricken character, never\r\nindicating much play of feeling, never any vigour or activity of\r\nimagination, never inspiring either art or poetry. Of such things we\r\nmust not think here.\r\n\r\nThe difference I allude to, and which is one of practical and of ever\r\nincreasing importance, is that between the Pagan and the Mahometan\r\npopulation, between those which hold to their original Fetishism, to\r\ntheir snake-worship and the like, and those who, having adopted the\r\ncreed of Islam, are (whatever else they may be) at least, Monotheists.\r\n\r\nThe Mahometans of the African states must always be separated from the\r\nPagans.\r\n\r\nThe negro districts of the western coast begin with the country of the\r\n_Wolofs_ or _Jolofs_, as far north as the southern border of the Desert,\r\nand the lower course of the river Senegal. There are no better-shaped\r\nnegroes than these same _Wolofs_, for they are tall, well-made, active,\r\nand intelligent men; Pagans, however, according to their original creed,\r\nrather than Mahometans.\r\n\r\nThe _Sereres_ of Cape Verde, and the _Scrawoolli_ in the interior, are\r\nin the same predicament.\r\n\r\nThe _Mandingoes_, like the Wolofs, are negroes but not Pagans. They are\r\namongst the first and foremost of the Mahometan negroes: but this\r\napplies only to the Mandingoes in the limited sense of the term--the\r\nMandingoes of the Gambia. In the wider sense of the word, the great\r\nMandingo class comprises more than twenty different populations, some of\r\nwhich are as Pagan as the most grovelling snake-worshippers of Dahomey.\r\n\r\nThen come the tribes of the islands between the Gambia and Sierra Leone;\r\nas also of the lower part of the rivers Grande, Nuñez, Casamanca, &c.\r\nUnder the names of _Felups_, _Papels_, _Nalus_, _Sapis_, _&c._, and we\r\nhave some of the rudest, but at the same time, the least known of the\r\nwestern negroes.\r\n\r\nBetween Sierra Leone and Cape Palmas, along with several populations\r\nmore or less akin to the Mandingo, lie the _Krumen_, whom a writer\r\nalready quoted, calls the Scotchmen of Africa. The Kruman leaves without\r\nhesitation or reluctance his own country to push his fortune wherever\r\nhe can find a wider field. He is ready for any employment which may\r\nenable him to increase his means, and ensure a return home in a state of\r\nimproved prosperity. There the Kruman’s ambition is to purchase one or\r\ntwo head of cattle, and one or two head of wives, and to enjoy the\r\nluxuries of rum and tobacco. Half the Africans that we see in Liverpool\r\nand London are Krumen, who have left their own country when young, and\r\ntaken employment on board a ship, where they exhibit a natural aptitude\r\nfor the sea. Without being nice as to the destination of the vessel in\r\nwhich they engage, they return home as soon as they can; and rarely or\r\nnever contract matrimony before their return. In Cape Coast Town, as\r\nwell as in Sierra Leone, they form a bachelor community quiet and\r\norderly; and in that respect stand in strong contrast to the other\r\ntribes, around them. Besides which, with all their blackness, and all\r\ntheir typical negro character, they are distinguishable from most other\r\nwestern Africans; having the advantage of them in make, features, and\r\nindustry. Hence, a Kruman is preëminently the _free labourer_ of Africa;\r\nquick of perception and amenable to instruction. His language is the\r\n_Grebo_ tongue, and it has been reduced to writing by the American\r\nmissionaries of Cape Palmas.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Coast gives as the chief populations the _Fantis_, and the\r\n_Ashantis_, pagan and negro; the latter remarkable for the consolidation\r\nof one of the more powerful kingdoms of Africa.\r\n\r\nIn _Dahomey_ we reach the _nadir_ of Negro rudeness; in Dahomey, where\r\nthe wars are the cruelest, the slave trade the most rife, and the\r\nheathenism, at one and the same time eminently debasing in itself, and\r\neminently unmodified by Mahometanism.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbouring kingdom of _Yoruba_, this is not so much the case,\r\nwhere the influence of the Fellatas has made itself felt.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the Delta of the Niger, the chief population of which\r\nis the _Ibo_.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Delta come the negroes of the Gaboon, and south of these\r\nthose of Loango, Angola, and Benguela. Between this last-named country\r\nand Walvisch Bay, the type changes to that of the browner-coloured\r\nCaffres, and the Hottentots. The _language_ changed long before--in the\r\nparts between the Gaboon and the old Calabar rivers.\r\n\r\nI do not profess that scientific imperturbability which enables me to\r\nwrite about such abominations as human sacrifice, and such follies as\r\nsnake-worship, without branding them and the nations that adopt them as\r\nbarbarous. They belong, however, to the darker side of the picture. The\r\nbrighter gives us something better; warmth of domestic feeling, aptitude\r\nfor such commercial dealings as their circumstances develop, adaptation\r\nto the habits of the European, susceptibility to the ameliorating\r\ninfluences both of Mahometanism and Christianity, are all negro\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed the character of the Kruman, we will now notice a negro\r\ntribe wherein an _alphabet_ has been evolved. A man of the _Vey_\r\ncountry, to the back of Liberia, a truly negro locality, named Doala\r\nBakara, having seen both Arabic and English books, conceived the idea of\r\nproducing an alphabet for his own tongue. This idea, as he tells the\r\nstory himself, haunted him in a dream, wherein he was shown a series of\r\nsigns of letters. These he forgot in the morning; but remembered the\r\nimpression. So he consulted his friends; and they and he, laying their\r\nheads together, coined new ones. The king of the country made its\r\nintroduction a matter of state, and built a large house as a day-school.\r\nThe effect of this has been, that a book in the Vey tongue has been\r\ndeciphered by an English scholar, and that several Vey natives, of both\r\nsexes can read and write. The alphabet itself is a _syllabarium_; _i.e._\r\nthere is a separate sign or letter, for the different _syllables_ of\r\nwhich a word consists--not for the different elementary sounds.\r\n\r\nThe darker individuals of the group before us have furnished a text upon\r\nwhich a general sketch of the negro population of Western Africa has\r\nbeen the commentary. Let us now turn to the men of the lighter\r\ncomplexion, and the less prominent lips. They are _Fellatas_,\r\n_Fellatahs_, or _Falatiya_. Sometimes they are called _Fellatiya Arabs_;\r\nbut they have nothing to do with the Arab of Arabia except so far as\r\nthey are Mahometans in creed, and somewhat light-complexioned in respect\r\nto their colour.\r\n\r\nThe metropolis of the Fellatas is Sakkatu, visited by Clapperton, from\r\nwhom the following remarkable history is taken:--Towards the end of the\r\nlast century a vast number of wandering pastoral tribes spread over that\r\npart of Central Africa, which is called _Sudania_--underwent a change in\r\nrespect to the social and political organisation, which Prichard\r\ncompares with that of the Arabs at the time of Mahomet. Many--but not\r\nall--of them embraced Mahometanism, and that with more than ordinary\r\nzeal and devotion. They visited the more civilised parts of Barbary,\r\nthey performed pilgrimages to Mecca, they recognised in one of their\r\nsheiks, called Danfodio, a prophet with a mission, to preach, to\r\nconvert, to conquer. Under his inspiration they attacked the pagan\r\npopulation of the countries around--Guber to the north, and Kubbi to the\r\nsouth, Zamfra, Kashna, and parts of the Houssa country to the east.\r\nTheir war-cry was _Allah Akbar_; their robes and flags white, emblematic\r\nof their purity. Kano was conquered without a blow, so was Yaouri, so\r\nwas the town of Eyo or Katunga on the Niger, so was part of the Nufi or\r\nTapua country--even the frontier of Bornou was violated.\r\n\r\nDanfodio’s death, which took place in 1818, was preceded by fits of\r\nreligious madness; not, however, before he had consolidated a great\r\nFellatah kingdom, and become the terror to the states around. It was in\r\nvain that a portion of his conquests revolted. The present Sultan of\r\nSakkatu, Mohammed Bello, is the most powerful prince of Africa, whether\r\npagan or Mahometan.\r\n\r\nMost of these Fellatas are Mahometans, some retaining their original\r\npaganism; but whether pagan or Mahometan, they are still the same\r\npeople. Their features are the same, their pastoral habits the same,\r\ntheir language the same. This is one of the most isolated tongues of\r\nAfrica; with plenty of miscellaneous, but no very definite or special\r\naffinities.\r\n\r\nIn _Borgho_, _i. e._ in the parts about Boussa, and Wawa, visited by\r\nLander, there are two populations, one speaking a language akin to the\r\n_Yoruba_, one akin to the Fellatah; so that there Fellata offsets in\r\nBorgho. But here, according to Lander, they have been in the country\r\nfrom time immemorial. Here, too, they hold themselves as a separate\r\npeople from the Fellatas of Sakkatu, dominant and powerful as that\r\nbranch is, and respectable as would be the connexion. Such, at least, is\r\nLander’s statement. Their name, too, undergoes a slight modification,\r\nand is _Filani_. They have neither idea nor tradition as to the\r\norigin--not at least the _Filani_ of Borgho.\r\n\r\nAll this looks as if Borgho were the original country of the Fellata\r\nstock, the starting-point from which they spread themselves abroad, If\r\nso, their movement must have been from south to north.\r\n\r\nBut we have yet to hear the whole of their history. Under the names of\r\n_Fula_, _Fulahs_, _Foule_ or _Peule_, they appear elsewhere. Where?--As\r\nfar north as the Wolof (or Jolof) country--as far north as the parts\r\nbetween the Senegal and the desert--as far north as 17 N. L. Here\r\nbetween Galam and Kayor is a vast Fula district--the district of the\r\nFulas of the Siratik. There on the south bank of the river lie the\r\nFulas of Foutatorro, an elevated tract of land forming the watershed to\r\nthe Senegal and the Gambia.\r\n\r\nThirdly, far in the interior, on the high ground over which Park passed\r\nfrom the drainage of the Senegal to that of the Niger, is a Fula-_du_,\r\nor country of the Fulas, between Bambuk and Bambarra.\r\n\r\nFourthly, there are the Fulas to the south of Bammakoo, in the parts\r\ncalled Wasselah, on the Niger itself.\r\n\r\nFifthly, in 11 N. L., on the head-water of the Rio Grande, is the large\r\nkingdom of the Fouta-jallo Fulahs, of which Timbu is the metropolis,\r\nsurrounded by dry and rocky deserts, and exposed mountain pastures,\r\nprolific with sheep, oxen, goats, and horses. Here, although the use of\r\nthe plough is unknown, the occupants cultivate the soil, and exercise\r\nmore than one of the mechanical arts. They forge iron and silver, weave,\r\nand tan, and support schools and mosques. To the south lies the Sulimana\r\ntribe, more or less akin to the Mandingoes. From these, Laing learnt,\r\nthat the acquisition of the country about Tembu by the Fulas of\r\nFuta-jallo was an event of no great antiquity, having taken place about\r\nA.D. 1700.\r\n\r\nThere are other Fula, Fellata, and Filani localities, but an enumeration\r\nof the foregoing has been sufficient. It shows the vast space of ground\r\ncovered by the population so-called. It shows, too, the difficulty of\r\nascertaining the original mother country. Indeed, upon the whole, this\r\nis a point upon which good writers are satisfied to suspend their\r\njudgment--no one having committed himself very decidedly to a preference\r\nfor one district over another.\r\n\r\nThe main facts lie in the superiority of their organisation over the\r\nordinary negro, and their higher civilisation--this being chiefly due to\r\ntheir Mahometanism. There is no doubt as to either. Although, the\r\nparticular shade of the particular colour which best suits the Fula is\r\nnot a matter upon which authors write with unanimity; the testimony of\r\nall observers goes to the fact that, whether Filani or Fellata, Fellata\r\nor Fula, whether pagan or Mahometan, whether Sudanian or Senegambian,\r\nwhether mountaineer or desert-born, the Fula is something different from\r\nthe typical Negro. Sometimes his complexion is intermediate to that of\r\nthe African and the Moor; sometimes he is described as being tawny, with\r\nsoft hair, and lips by no means prominent: sometimes the skin is of a\r\nreddish-black, the countenances being regular. “The tribe of Fulas,”\r\nwrites Golberry, “which under the name of Foules or Peuls, have peopled\r\nthe borders of the Senegal between Podhon and Galam, are black with a\r\ntinge of red or copper colour; they are in general handsome and\r\nwell-made; the women are handsome, but proud and indolent.”\r\n\r\nTo the Fula-jallo Fulas the very definite and suggestive term “Red\r\nPeuls” has been applied; to which the name “Black Peuls” stands in\r\nopposition, this meaning the Fulas of the north bank of the lower\r\nSenegal.\r\n\r\nWhat is our inference from these discrepancies of description--what our\r\ninference from the points of agreement? Even this[42]--that the Fula\r\ncomplexion varies with the physical conditions of the Fula locality. In\r\nthe high and exposed tracts of Fula-jallo it is the least, in the lower\r\nlevels of the parts about lake Kayor, it is most like that of the negro.\r\n\r\n  [42] For further details, see Prichard, _Researches, &c._, vol. ii.\r\n  pp. 66-73, and 121-125.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP VIII.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN AFRICA.--NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE CAPE.--PORT NATAL.\r\n\r\nA. ZULUS. (THE TALLER AND DARKER.) B. BUSHMEN. (THE SHORTER AND\r\nBROWNER.)\r\n\r\nA. The Zulu group is taken from life--from the men lately exhibited at\r\nSt. George’s Hall. The story told is the search for some lost article.\r\nWhen this is the case, a _Fetish-man_, _medium-man_, _mystery-man_, or\r\n_conjuror_ (we may choose our name), is called in, and set upon the\r\nsuspected parties, who sit round in a circle. The conjuror then works\r\nhimself, like the Pythoness of the old oracles, into a state of rabid\r\nexcitement, and keeps it up until he fixes upon the culprit.\r\n\r\nNothing is less peculiar than this practice throughout\r\nAfrica--throughout, indeed, most savage countries; nor is it without its\r\nvalue. Writing about the same practice on the Gold Coast, an author\r\nalready quoted, after stating the “superstitious rites employed by the\r\nFetish-men for the detection of crime,” adds, “and whether it is that\r\nthese people really possess such powerful influence over their wretched\r\ndupes, as to frighten into confession of his guilt the perpetrator of\r\ncrime, or whether it is that they manage by their numerous spies to\r\nobtain a clue sufficient in most cases to lead to the detection of the\r\nperson, is more than I can venture to assert; but, be the means\r\nemployed what they may, a Fetish-man will assuredly very often bring a\r\ncrime home to the right person, even after the most patient\r\ninvestigation in the ordinary way has failed to elicit the slightest\r\nclue.”\r\n\r\nThe Zulus come from the part about Port Natal. They are closely allied,\r\nin language, at least, to the Kaffres--the Kaffres of the Amakosa,\r\nAmaponda, Amatembu, and other tribes, but too well known to the Cape\r\nColonist and the English tax-payer.\r\n\r\nThey are similarly allied to the Bechuana tribes of the interior. The\r\nBechuanas, however, are browner in colour, as is expected from their\r\nlocality, which is high and dry.\r\n\r\nThe Fingoes are also an allied population.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the Proper Kaffres, the Bechuanas, the Fingoes,\r\nand the Zulus, lie within a small compass, so that the general likeness\r\nis pretty clear. But neither the differences nor the likenesses between\r\nthe populations akin to the Kaffres end here.\r\n\r\nThe word (the derivation of which has been given elsewhere) has two\r\nmeanings. It means, in its more limited sense, the Kaffres of Caffraria,\r\nchiefly of the Amakosa tribe, the men who have given so much trouble to\r\nthe colonists. But it also has a wider or more general signification,\r\nand in this case it serves as the designation of a large family of\r\nallied populations--and a very large family--one of the largest in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe connecting link between its numerous branches is the language, of\r\nwhich the structure has (amongst others) the following characteristic\r\npeculiarities. Suppose that in English, instead of saying\r\n\r\n  _M_an’s _d_og, we said _d_an _d_og,\r\n  _S_un’s _b_eam--_b_un _b_eam,\r\n  _F_ather’s _d_aughter--_d_ather _d_aughter,\r\n  _D_aughter’s father--_f_aughter _f_ather;\r\n\r\nin such a case we should accommodate the sound of the word in the\r\npossessive case to that with which the word in the nominative case\r\nbegan. And if we did this, we should assuredly do something very\r\nremarkable in the way of speech. Now the Kaffre tongues _all_ do this.\r\nIt is done by the Amakosa, the Zulu, the Fingo, the Bechuana. It is done\r\nby the languages on the _western_ coast as far as the Cameroons, _i.e._,\r\nto the north of the equator--by the languages of Benguela, Angola,\r\nCongo, Loango, and the Gaboon, &c. It is done by the languages on the\r\n_eastern_ coast as well; indeed, it was very probably done by the\r\nlanguage of the Moegurras. It is done, so far as we know, by all the\r\nlanguages of the interior south of the equator--save and except those of\r\nthe Hottentot class. It is certainly done by the languages of the Great\r\nLake Ngami.\r\n\r\nThe Kaffre division, then, is a large one; and it is based, chiefly, on\r\nsimilarity of language. In physical form, the range of difference is\r\ngreat. Some of the Kaffres are truly negro, others brown in colour, and\r\nwith lips of moderate thickness. The Zulus before us certainly approach\r\nthe negro.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, more than one good writer has enlarged upon the\r\npoints of contrast; and such there certainly are, if we take the more\r\nextreme forms--the typical Kaffre and typical Negro. In the latter, for\r\ninstance, the skin (as aforesaid) may be brown rather than black. Then\r\nthe cheek-bones may project outwards; and where the cheek-bones so\r\nproject beyond a certain limit, the chin appears to taper downwards, and\r\nthe vertex upwards. When this becomes exaggerated, we hear of\r\n_lozenge-shaped_ skulls. Be this as it may, the breadth in the malar\r\nportion of the face is often a remarkable feature in the Kaffre\r\nphysiognomy. This he has in common with the Hottentot. Sometimes, too,\r\nthe eye is oblique; the opening generally narrow.\r\n\r\nAn opinion often gives a better picture than a description. Kaffres,\r\nthat have receded in the greatest degree from the negro type, have been\r\nso likened to the more southern Arabs, as to have engendered the\r\nhypothesis of an infusion of Arab blood.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the Kaffres of the Cape are those of pastoral tribes\r\nunder chieftains; tribes which, from their habits and social relations,\r\nare naturally active, locomotive, warlike, and jealous of encroachment.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange indeed if the Kaffre life and Kaffre physiognomy had\r\nno peculiarities. However little in the way of physical influence we may\r\nattribute to the geography of a country, no man ignores them altogether.\r\nNow Kaffreland has very nearly a latitude of its own; inhabited lands\r\nsimilarly related to the southern tropic being found in South America\r\nand Australia only. And it has a soil still more exclusively\r\nSouth-African. We connect the idea of the _desert_ with that of sand;\r\nwhilst _steppe_ is a term which is limited to the vast tracts of central\r\nAsia. Now the Kaffre, and still more the Hottentot, area, dry like the\r\ndesert, and elevated like the steppe, is called a _karro_. Its soil is\r\noften a hard, cracked, and parched clay rather than a waste of sand, and\r\nit constitutes an argillaceous table-land.\r\n\r\nTheir polity and manners, too, are peculiar. The head-man of the village\r\nsettles disputes, his tribunal being in the open air. From him an appeal\r\nlies to a chief of higher power; and from him to some superior, higher\r\nstill. In this way there is a long chain of feudal or semi-feudal\r\ndependency.\r\n\r\nThe wife is the slave to the husband; and he _buys_ her in order that\r\nshe should be so. The purchase implies a seller. This is always a member\r\nof another tribe. Hence the wish of a Kaffre is to see his wife the\r\nmother of many children, girls being more valuable than boys.\r\n\r\nWhy a man should not sell his offspring to the members of his own tribe\r\nis uncertain. It is clear, however, that the practice of doing so makes\r\nmarriage between even distant relations next to impossible. To guard\r\nagainst the chances of this, a rigid and suspicious system of restraint\r\nhas been developed in cases of consanguinity; and relations must do all\r\nthey can to avoid meeting. To sit in the same room, to meet on the same\r\nroad, is undesirable. To converse is but just allowable, and then all\r\nwho choose must hear what is said. So thorough, however, has been the\r\nisolation in many cases, that persons of different sexes have lived as\r\nnear neighbours for many years without having conversed with each other;\r\nand such communication as there has been, has taken place through the\r\nmedium of a third person. No gift will induce a Kaffre female to violate\r\nthis law.\r\n\r\nB. The Bushmen, too, are taken from life, the two children being in\r\nEngland at the present time.\r\n\r\nJust as the Zulu belongs to the Kaffre, the Bushman belongs to the\r\nHottentot family--the latter family being a large one; not so large,\r\nhowever, as the former. The present Hottentot districts, wholly\r\nsurrounded by the Kaffre, lie on the _western_ rather than _eastern_\r\nside of South Africa, and extend from the parts about Valvisch Bay to\r\nthe Cape; the original population of the last-named locality having\r\nbecome well-nigh extinct.\r\n\r\nHow has this extinction been effected? In two ways. By the European\r\nsettlers of the colony---Dutch and English, English and Dutch; by the\r\nKaffres, who have ever spread southwards. Before these encroachments had\r\ntaken effect, there were Hottentot tribes on the eastern as well as the\r\n_western_ coast, on _both_ sides of South Africa. Now there are none,\r\neither on the side of the Pacific, or in the parts about the Cape\r\nitself--except (of course) so far as they are mixed up with the colonial\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe names (all or some) of the extinct branches of the Hottentot family\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\n 1. Gunyeman, nearest the Cape.\r\n\r\n 2. Kokha_qua_, north of the Gunyeman.\r\n\r\n 3. Sussa_qua_, Saldanha Bay.\r\n\r\n 4. Odi_qua_.\r\n\r\n 5. Khirigri_quas_, on Elephants’ River.\r\n\r\n 6. Koopmans.\r\n\r\n 7. Hessa_quas_.\r\n\r\n 8. Son_quas_, east of the Cape.\r\n\r\n 9. Dun_quas_.\r\n\r\n10. Dama_quas_.\r\n\r\n11. Guari_quas_.\r\n\r\n12. Honteni_quas_.\r\n\r\n13. Khantouers.\r\n\r\n14. Heykoms, as far on the north-east as Natal. Now replaced by Amakosah\r\nKaffres.\r\n\r\nThe chief divisions still existing are the _Gonaquas_, the _Koranas_,\r\nthe _Namaquas_ (between Valvisch Bay and the Orange River), the _Soun\r\nDarmup_, of the Dammara Country (to the back of Valvisch Bay), and the\r\n_Saabs_, or Bushmen.\r\n\r\nThe Koranas are the best-shaped and best-looking of the Hottentots; the\r\nBushmen the worst. The latter, indeed, are the starvelings of the\r\nfamily. They belong to the most miserable part of the _Karroo_, and they\r\nhave neither flocks nor herds.\r\n\r\nThe Laplander of Lapland is not more strongly contrasted with his strong\r\nand sturdy neighbour of the Duchy of Finland than are the Korana and the\r\nSaab. The former are well-grown men, though of the Hottentot family. The\r\nSaabs are described as having constitutions “so much enfeebled by the\r\ndissolute life they lead, and the constant smoking of _dacha_, that\r\nnearly all, including the young people, look old and wrinkled;\r\nnevertheless, they are remarkable for vanity, and decorate their ears,\r\nlegs, and arms with beads, and iron, copper, or brass rings. The women\r\nlikewise stain their faces red, or paint them, either wholly or in part.\r\nTheir clothing consists of a few sheepskins, which hang about their\r\nbodies, and thus form the mantle or covering, commonly called a\r\n_kaross_. This is their only clothing by day or night. The men wear old\r\nhats, which they obtain from the farmers, or else caps of their own\r\nmanufacture. The women wear caps of skins, which they stiffen and finish\r\nwith a high peak, and adorn with beads and metal rings. The dwelling of\r\nthe Bushman is either a low wretched hut, or a circular cavity, on the\r\nopen plain, into which, at night, he creeps with his wife and children,\r\nand which, though it shelters him from the wind, leaves him exposed to\r\nthe rain. In this neighbourhood, in which rocks abound, they had\r\nformerly their habitations in them, as is proved by the many rude\r\nfigures of oxen, horses, serpents, &c. still existing. It is not a\r\nlittle interesting to see these poor degraded people, who formerly were\r\nconsidered and treated as little better than wild beasts in their rocky\r\nretreats. Many of those who have forsaken us live in such cavities not\r\nfar from our settlement, and we have thus an opportunity of observing\r\nthem in their natural condition. Several who, when they came to us from\r\nthe farmers, were decently clothed and possessed a flock of sheep, which\r\nthey had earned, in a short time returned to their fastnesses in a state\r\nof nakedness and indigence, rejoicing that they had got free from the\r\nfarmers, and could live as they pleased in the indulgence of their\r\nsensual appetites. Such fugitives from civilised life, I have never seen\r\notherwise occupied than with their bows and arrows. The bows are small,\r\nbut made of good elastic wood; the arrows are formed of small reeds, the\r\npoints furnished with a well-wrought piece of bone, and a double barb,\r\nwhich is steeped in a potent poison of a resiny appearance. This poison\r\nis distilled from the leaves of an indigenous tree. Many prefer these\r\narrows to fire-arms, under the idea that they can kill more game by\r\nmeans of a weapon that makes no report. On their return from the chase,\r\nthey feast till they are tired and drowsy, and hunger alone rouses them\r\nto renewed exertion. In seasons of scarcity they devour all kinds of\r\nwild roots, ants, ants’ eggs, locusts, snakes, and even roasted skins.\r\nThree women of this singular tribe were not long since met with, several\r\ndays’ journey from this place, who had forsaken their husbands, and\r\nlived very contentedly on wild honey and locusts. As enemies, the\r\nBushmen are not to be despised. They are adepts in stealing cattle and\r\nsheep; and the wounds they inflict when pursued, are ordinarily fatal if\r\nthe wounded part is not immediately cut out. The animals they are unable\r\nto carry off, they kill or mutilate.\r\n\r\n“To our great comfort, even some of these poor outcasts have shown\r\neagerness to become acquainted with the way of salvation. The children\r\nof such as are inhabitants of the settlement, attend the school\r\ndiligently, and of them we have the best hopes.\r\n\r\n“The language of the Bushman has not one pleasing feature; it seems to\r\nconsist of a collection of snapping, hissing, grunting, sounds, all more\r\nor less nasal. It is this language that shows that the Saab and\r\nHottentot belong to the same family.”\r\n\r\nWe now move to the parts on the _left_ of the entrance, and begin with\r\nthe parts opposite the Zulus and Bushmen. These give us the southern\r\nparts of South America--not, however, the extreme south.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP IX.\r\n\r\nBOTOCUDOS AND PAMPA GIRL.\r\n\r\nThe word _Botocudo_ means _plugged_; and it belongs to the Portuguese\r\nlanguage. It is applied by the Brazilians to the populations of this\r\ngroup, from the fact of their perforating their lips and ears, and\r\ninserting pieces of wood in the openings. In their quarrels, these are\r\ntorn out, and shreds of the lip or ear to which they belong left\r\nhanging. One of these quarrels described and sketched in the Travels of\r\nPrince Maximilian of Neuwied, is here represented, the faces being taken\r\nfrom casts in the possession of Professor Retzius, and the drawings in\r\nthe Travels of Spix and Von Martius. The native name--the name by which\r\nthe Botocudos designate themselves--is _Engraecknung_.\r\n\r\nTheir country lies to the north of Rio Janiero--between eighteen and\r\ntwenty degrees N.L. It never touches the sea-coast now, whatever it may\r\nhave once done. On the contrary, it lies inland, and is limited to the\r\nmountain-range called _Tierra dos Aymores_; wherein lie the sources of\r\nthe rivers Doce and Pardo.\r\n\r\nOn each of these we find Botocudos; those of the latter having been\r\ninduced to abandon, along with some of their more barbarous habits,\r\ntheir inveterate hostility to the Portuguese. The other still retain\r\ntheir original and notorious barbarism. They have ceased, however, to be\r\nformidable; though, in the sixteenth century, they carried on a\r\ndestructive warfare against the settlers in the Government of Porto\r\nSeguro. They have the credit of being cannibals.\r\n\r\nThe language is peculiar, and different from the other Indians of the\r\nsame range. Of these the Machacaris, the Patachos, the Camacans, the\r\nMalali, are the chief.\r\n\r\nThe girl in the bullock’s hide is one of the Pampa Indians; the face\r\nbeing taken from a cast of Professor Retzius.\r\n\r\nThe Pampas are vast plains to the south of the Rio Plata, destitute of\r\ntrees, free from hills, and without rivers. They are traversed by\r\ninnumerable herds of oxen and horses, in every stage of domestication or\r\nof wildness. The Indians, whose habits are determined by these physical\r\nconditions of the soil, are rude, ferocious, and independent; hardy\r\neven for Indians; and very Centaurs for their skill in horsemanship.\r\nThey range over the whole district between the frontier of Buenos Ayres\r\nand the western foot of the Andes of Chili.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP X.\r\n\r\nINDIANS OF THE AMAZONS.\r\n\r\nThe tribes of so vast a river as the Amazons are numerous, even if we go\r\nno further than the main stream--much more so if we look to those on its\r\nfeeders.\r\n\r\nAt the same time they are fragmentary, and most imperfectly known.\r\nNeither are they free from intermixture--Spanish intermixture on the\r\nwestern, and Portuguese on the eastern.\r\n\r\nAll the tribes, however, illustrated by the figures before us, belong to\r\nBrazil, _i.e._, to _Portuguese_ America.\r\n\r\nTheir history is that of aborigines in general; there is their period of\r\nindependence, their period of oppression, their period of mitigated\r\npersecution--of reaction.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the history of the parts about the rivers Negro and\r\nMadeira--the one joining the Amazons from the north, the others from the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1671, a company of soldiers was stationed to protect the Portuguese\r\ntrade, and the foundation of the Villa da Barra de Rio Negro was laid by\r\nAntonio de Albuquerque Coelho. This was the area of the Juripixunas, or\r\nJuruuna--Indians--the _Blackfaces_, so called because they tattooed\r\nthemselves black. These also were numerous, and not intractable; handy\r\nwith their canoes, and active on the water. As many as 1000 at a time\r\nfound their way to the slave-market at Pera. Sometimes they were stolen\r\nwithout the disguise of a quarrel--stolen, because the man-stealer was\r\nthe stronger. But, at times, there was a clever piece of villany put in\r\npractice. The slave-hunter would get a cross, the symbol of his\r\nreligion, lay it somewhere in the track of the Indians, look for it some\r\ndays afterwards, miss it, and then make a charge of sacrilege against\r\nthe Indians of the locality. Out of practices like these rose regular\r\nslave-hunting settlements, with barracoons, after the fashion of the\r\nnegro slave-trade. There was the usual practice, with the usual\r\nincentives, the usual organisation, the usual wars to follow, violence,\r\nunscrupulousness, cruelty, blood. The enemy to the Indian was the\r\ntrader; his best friend the priest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weapons, &c., from the Amazons.]\r\n\r\nWhen King John IV., in 1652, wished to enact a favourable code for the\r\naborigines, the governors of Maranham and Para instigated the population\r\nof their respective governments to uproarious manifestations.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1661, the Jesuits were expelled; in A.D. 1679 reinstated. The\r\ninterval was a time of sorrow to the Indians; the restoration a time of\r\njoy. The establishment of missions now began.\r\n\r\nA settlement or village, _Aldea_, was founded in some favourable\r\nsituation, and the Indians of the neighbourhood induced to put\r\nthemselves under the tutelage of the resident and directorial father.\r\nThey were then taught to cultivate the soil or to weave--taught as\r\nchildren, and, when the temper was not that of the wilder and more\r\nindependent tribes, this training answered. They were also instructed in\r\nthe Christian creed, the medium being the Tupi language. Their own\r\ndialects were numerous--too numerous to make the cultivation of them in\r\ndetail practicable; and in each _aldea_ the variety of such dialects was\r\nconsiderable, each being spoken by but a few individuals. To learn a\r\ndifficult language for the sake of so few, was an unnecessary\r\nexpenditure of time for the Jesuits; whilst Portuguese was a difficult\r\nlanguage for the Indians. The surer plan, then, of taking the most\r\nprevalent Indian tongue and making it into a kind of common medium, a\r\nlingua franca, was devised. This prevalent tongue was the Tupi, and the\r\nname it took was the Portuguese one of _Lingoa Geral_--_general\r\nlanguage_. Until A.D. 1757, the _Lingoa Geral_ was used in the\r\nlaw-courts of Gram Parà. This state of things lasted till A.D. 1759,\r\nwhen the Jesuits were expelled; from Parà and Maranham as many as 112.\r\n\r\nIn 1718, the number of _aldeas_ was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Jesuits        19\r\n  Capuchins      15\r\n  Carmelites      5\r\n\r\nOfficers called Directors took the places of the Jesuits. In many\r\nrespects their orders were those of their predecessors. They were to\r\nteach and convert; but they were also to get some work out of the\r\nIndians in the way of public service, _e. g._, in the arsenals as\r\npilots, as a kind of police in the case of Indian warfare and\r\nbush-ranging. And beside these points of difference, the Tupi, or\r\n_Lingoa Geral_, was to be replaced by the Portuguese. In the localities\r\nwhere the intercourse with the whites was important, judges were\r\nappointed to settle disputes. Kidnapping however continued, and things\r\nwent ill with the Indians until the separation of Brazil from Portugal;\r\nand they have gone ill since. The Indians and the negroes form the\r\nlowest part of the not elevated population of Parà, the half-blood\r\nbetween them (the Indians) and the whites being called Cafusos. Both the\r\nCafusos and the full-blooded Indians are free, but they are not\r\nflourishing. They drink and live lives of idleness. They live, in short,\r\nmuch as all the coloured races when the whites are in contact with them.\r\n\r\nThis prepares us for the necessity of seeking the Indian in his\r\nunmodified state on the feeders of the Amazons, rather than the main\r\nstream. Mr. Wallace has described those of the Uaupés--which falls into\r\nthe Rio Negro from the west, and lie just under the equator.\r\n\r\nHe remarks upon the extent to which they are a truly unsophisticated\r\npopulation, and also upon the extent to which they differ from the\r\nIndians lower down, _i.e._, between Barra and Para, the junction of the\r\nRio Negro and Amazons, and the mouth of that latter river. His\r\ndescription (founded on personal observation) is one of the best we\r\nhave. I quote it freely:--“All the tribes of the Uaupés,” he writes,\r\n“construct their dwellings after one plan, which is peculiar to them.\r\nTheir houses are the abode of numerous families, sometimes of a whole\r\ntribe. The plan is a parallelogram, with a semicircle at one end. The\r\ndimensions of one at Jauarité were one hundred and fifteen feet in\r\nlength, by seventy-five broad, and about thirty high. This house would\r\nhold about a dozen families, consisting of near a hundred individuals.\r\nIn times of feasts and dances, three or four hundred are accommodated in\r\nthem. The roof is supported on fine cylindrical columns, formed of the\r\ntrunks of trees, and beautifully straight and smooth. In the centre a\r\nclear opening is left, twenty feet wide, and on the sides are little\r\npartitions of palm-leaf thatch, dividing off rooms for the separate\r\nfamilies: here are kept the private household utensils, weapons, and\r\nornaments; while the rest of the space contains, on each side, the large\r\novens and gigantic pans for making caxirí, and, in the centre, a place\r\nfor the children to play, and for their dances to take place. These\r\nhouses are built with much labour and skill; the main supporters, beams,\r\nrafters, and other parts, are straight, well proportioned to the\r\nstrength required, and bound together with split creepers, in a manner\r\nthat a sailor would admire. The thatch is of the leaf of some one of the\r\nnumerous palms so well adapted to the purpose, and is laid on with great\r\ncompactness and regularity. The walls, which are very low, are formed\r\nalso of palm thatch, but so thick and so well bound together, that\r\nneither arrow nor bullet will penetrate it. At the gable-end is a large\r\ndoorway, about six feet wide and eight or ten high: the door is a large\r\npalm-mat, hung from the top, supported by a pole during the day, and let\r\ndown at night. At the semicircular end is a smaller door, which is the\r\nprivate entrance of the Tushaúa, or chief, to whom this part of the\r\nhouse exclusively belongs. The lower part of the gable-end, on each side\r\nof the entrance, is covered with the thick bark of a tree unrolled, and\r\nstanding vertically. Above this is a loose hanging of palm-leaves,\r\nbetween the fissures of which the smoke from the numerous fires within\r\nfinds an exit. In some cases this gable-end is much ornamented with\r\nsymmetrical figures painted in colours.\r\n\r\n“The furniture consists principally of maqueiras, or hammocks, made of\r\nstring, twisted from the fibres of the leaves of the _Mauritia\r\nflexuosa_: they are merely an open network of parallel threads, crossed\r\nby others at intervals of a foot; the loops at each end have a cord\r\npassed through them, by which they are hung up. The Uaupés make great\r\nquantities of string of this and other fibres, twisting it on their\r\nbreasts or thighs, with great rapidity.\r\n\r\n“They have always in their houses a large supply of earthen pots, pans,\r\npitchers, and cooking utensils, of various sizes, which they make of\r\nclay from the river and brooks, mixed with the ashes of the caripé bark,\r\nand baked in a temporary furnace. They have also great quantities of\r\nsmall saucer-shaped baskets, called ‘Balaios,’ which are much esteemed\r\ndown the river, and are the subject of a considerable trade.\r\n\r\n“Two tribes in the lower part of the river, the Tariános and Tucános,\r\nmake a curious little stool, cut out of a solid block of wood, and\r\nneatly painted and varnished; these, which take many days to finish, are\r\nsold for about a pennyworth of fish-hooks.\r\n\r\n“Their canoes are all made out of a single tree, hollowed and forced\r\nopen by the cross-benches; they are very thick in the middle, to resist\r\nthe wear and tear they are exposed to among the rocks and rapids; they\r\nare often forty feet long, but smaller ones are generally preferred. The\r\npaddles are about three feet long, with an oval blade, and are each cut\r\nout of one piece of wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weapons, &c., from the Amazons.]\r\n\r\n“These people are as free from the encumbrances of dress as it is\r\npossible to conceive. The men wear only a small piece of tururf passed\r\nbetween the legs, and twisted on to a string round the loins. Even such\r\na costume as this is dispensed with by the women: they have no dress or\r\ncovering whatever, but are entirely naked. This is the universal custom\r\namong the Uaupés Indians, from which, in a state of nature, they never\r\ndepart. Paint, with these people, seems to be looked upon as a\r\nsufficient clothing; they are never without it on some parts of their\r\nbodies, but it is at their festivals that they exhibit all their art in\r\nthus decorating their persons: the colours they use are red, yellow, and\r\nblack, and they dispose them generally in regular patterns, similar to\r\nthose with which they ornament their stools, their canoes, and other\r\narticles of furniture.\r\n\r\n“They pour the juice of a tree, which stains a deep blue-black, on their\r\nheads, and let it run in streams all down their backs; and the red and\r\nyellow are often disposed in large round spots upon the cheeks and\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n“The use of ornaments and trinkets of various kinds is almost confined\r\nto the men. The women wear a bracelet on the wrists, but none on the\r\nneck, and no comb in the hair; they have a garter below the knee, worn\r\ntight from infancy, for the purpose of swelling out the calf, which they\r\nconsider a great beauty. While dancing in their festivals, the women\r\nwear a small tanga, or apron, made of beads, prettily arranged: it is\r\nonly about six inches square, but is never worn at any other time, and\r\nimmediately the dance is over, it is taken off.\r\n\r\n“The men, on the other hand, have the hair carefully parted and combed\r\non each side, and tied in a queue behind. In the young men, it hangs in\r\nlong locks down their necks, and, with the comb, which is invariably\r\ncarried stuck in the top of the head, gives to them a most feminine\r\nappearance: this is increased by the large necklaces and bracelets of\r\nbeads, and the careful extirpation of every symptom of beard. Taking\r\nthese circumstances into consideration, I am strongly of opinion that\r\nthe story of the Amazons has arisen from these feminine-looking warriors\r\nencountered by the early voyager. I am inclined to this opinion, from\r\nthe effect they first produced on myself, when it was only by close\r\nexamination I saw that they were men; and, were the front parts of their\r\nbodies and their breasts covered with shields, such as they always use,\r\nI am convinced any person seeing them for the first time would conclude\r\nthey were women. We have only therefore to suppose that tribes having\r\nsimilar customs to those now existing on the river Uaupés, inhabited the\r\nregions where the Amazons were reported to have been seen, and we have a\r\nrational explanation of what has so much puzzled all geographers. The\r\nonly objection to this explanation is, that traditions are said to exist\r\namong the natives, of a nation of ‘women without husbands.’ Of this\r\ntradition, however, I was myself unable to obtain any trace, and I can\r\neasily imagine it entirely to have arisen from the suggestions and\r\ninquiries of Europeans themselves. When the story of the Amazons was\r\nfirst made known, it became of course a point with all future travellers\r\nto verify it, or if possible get a glimpse of these warlike ladies. The\r\nIndians must no doubt have been overwhelmed with questions and\r\nsuggestions about them, and they, thinking that the white men must know\r\nbest, would transmit to their descendants and families the idea that\r\nsuch a nation did exist in some distant part of the country. Succeeding\r\ntravellers, finding traces of this idea among the Indians, would take it\r\nas a proof of the existence of the Amazons; instead of being merely the\r\neffect of a mistake at the first, which had been unknowingly spread\r\namong them by preceding travellers, seeking to obtain some evidence on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n“Tattooing is very little practised by these Indians; they all, however,\r\nhave a row of circular punctures along the arm, and one tribe, the\r\nTucános, are distinguished from the rest by three vertical blue lines on\r\nthe chin; and they also pierce the lower lip, through which they hang\r\nthree little threads of white beads. All the tribes bore their ears, and\r\nwear in them little pieces of grass, ornamented with feathers. The\r\nCobeus alone expand the hole to so large a size, that a bottle-cork\r\ncould be inserted; they ordinarily wear a plug of wood in it, but, on\r\nfestas, insert a little bunch of arrows.\r\n\r\n“The men generally have but one wife, but there is no special limit, and\r\nmany have two or three, and some of the chiefs more; the elder one is\r\nnever turned away, but remains the mistress of the house. They have no\r\nparticular ceremony at their marriages, except that of always carrying\r\naway the girl by force, or making a show of doing so, even when she and\r\nher parents are quite willing. They do not often marry with relations,\r\nor even neighbours,--preferring those from a distance, or even from\r\nother tribes. When a young man wishes to have the daughter of another\r\nIndian, his father sends a message to say he will come with his son and\r\nrelations to visit him. The girl’s father guesses what it is for, and,\r\nif he is agreeable, makes preparations for a grand festival: it lasts\r\nperhaps two or three days, when the bridegroom’s party suddenly seize\r\nthe bride, and hurry her off to their canoes; no attempt is made to\r\nprevent them, and she is then considered as married.\r\n\r\n“Some tribes, as the Uacarrás, have a trial of skill at shooting with\r\nthe bow and arrow, and if the young man does not show himself a good\r\nmarksman, the girl refuses him, on the ground that he will not be able\r\nto shoot fish and game enough for the family.\r\n\r\n“The dead are almost always buried in the houses, with their bracelets,\r\ntobacco-bag, and other trinkets upon them; they are buried the same day\r\nthey die, the parents and relations keeping up a continual mourning and\r\nlamentation over the body, from the death to the time of interment; a\r\nfew days afterwards, a great quantity of caxirí is made, and all friends\r\nand relatives invited to attend, to mourn for the dead, and to dance,\r\nsing, and cry to his memory. Some of the large houses have more than a\r\nhundred graves in them, but when the houses are small, and very full,\r\nthe graves are made outside,\r\n\r\n“The Tariánas and Tucános, and some other tribes, about a month after\r\nthe funeral, disinter the corpse, which is then much decomposed, and put\r\nit in a great pan, or oven, over the fire, till all the volatile parts\r\nare driven off with a most horrible odour, leaving only a black\r\ncarbonaceous mass, which is pounded into a fine powder, and mixed in\r\nseveral large couchés (vats made of hollowed trees) of caxirí: this is\r\ndrunk by the assembled company till all is finished; they believe that\r\nthus the virtues of the deceased will be transmitted to the drinkers.\r\n\r\n“The Cobeus alone, in the Uaupés, are real cannibals: they eat those of\r\nother tribes, whom they kill in battle, and even make war for the\r\nexpress purpose of procuring human flesh for food. When they have more\r\nthan they can consume at once, they smoke-dry the flesh over the fire,\r\nand preserve it for food a long time. They burn their dead, and drink\r\nthe ashes in caxirí, in the same manner as described above.\r\n\r\n“Every tribe and every ‘malocca’ (as their houses are called) has its\r\nchief, or ‘Tushaúa,’ who has a limited authority over them, principally\r\nin war, in making festivals, and in repairing the malocca and keeping\r\nthe village clean, and in planting the mandiocca-fields; he also treats\r\nwith the traders, and supplies them with men to pursue their journeys.\r\nThe succession of these chiefs is strictly hereditary in the male line,\r\nor through the female to her husband, who may be a stranger: their\r\nregular hereditary chief is never superseded, however stupid, dull, or\r\ncowardly he may be. They have very little law of any kind; but what they\r\nhave is of strict retaliation,--an eye for an eye and a tooth for a\r\ntooth; and a murder is punished or revenged in the same manner and by\r\nthe same weapon with which it was committed.\r\n\r\n“They have numerous ‘Pagés,’ a kind of priests, answering to the\r\n‘medicine-men’ of the North American Indians. These are believed to have\r\ngreat power: they cure all diseases by charms, applied by strong blowing\r\nand breathing upon the party to be cured, and by the singing of certain\r\nsongs and incantations. They are also believed to have power to kill\r\nenemies, to bring or send away rain, to destroy dogs or game, to make\r\nthe fish leave a river, and to afflict with various diseases. They are\r\nmuch consulted and believed in, and are well paid for their services. An\r\nIndian will give almost all his wealth to a pagé, when he is threatened\r\nwith any real or imaginary danger.\r\n\r\n“They scarcely seem to think that death can occur naturally, always\r\nimputing it either to direct poisoning or the charms of some enemy, and,\r\non this supposition, will proceed to revenge it. This they generally do\r\nby poisons, of which they have many which are most deadly in their\r\neffects: they are given at some festival in a bowl of caxirí, which it\r\nis good manners always to empty, so that the whole dose is sure to be\r\ntaken. One of the poisons often used is most terrible in its effects,\r\ncausing the tongue and throat, as well as the intestines, to putrefy and\r\nrot away, so that the sufferer lingers some days in the greatest agony:\r\nthis is of course again retaliated, on perhaps the wrong party, and thus\r\na long succession of murders may result from a mere groundless suspicion\r\nin the first instance.\r\n\r\n“I cannot make out that they have any belief that can be called a\r\nreligion. They appear to have no definite idea of a God; if asked who\r\nthey think made the rivers, and the forests, and the sky, they will\r\nreply that they do not know, or sometimes that they suppose it was\r\n‘Tupánau,’ a word that appears to answer to God, but of which they\r\nunderstand nothing. They have much more definite ideas of a bad spirit,\r\n‘Juruparí,’ or Devil, whom they fear, and endeavour through their pagés\r\nto propitiate. When it thunders, they say the ‘Juruparí’ is angry, and\r\ntheir idea of natural death is that the Juruparí kills them. At an\r\neclipse they believe that this bad spirit is killing the moon, and they\r\nmake all the noise they can to frighten him away.\r\n\r\n“One of their most singular superstitions is about the musical\r\ninstruments they use at their festivals, which they call the Juruparí\r\nmusic. They consist of eight or sometimes twelve pipes or trumpets, made\r\nof bamboos or palm-stems hollowed out, some with trumpet-shaped mouths\r\nof bark and with mouth-holes of clay and leaf. Each pair of instruments\r\ngives a distinct note, and they produce a rather agreeable concert,\r\nsomething resembling clarionets and bassoons. These instruments however\r\nare with them such a mystery, that no woman must ever see them on pain\r\nof death. They are always kept in some igaripé, at a certain distance\r\nfrom the malocca, whence they are brought on particular occasions: when\r\nthe sound of them is heard approaching, every woman retires into the\r\nwoods, or into some adjoining shed, which they generally have near, and\r\nremains invisible till after the ceremony is over, when the instruments\r\nare taken away to their hiding-place, and the women come out of their\r\nconcealment. Should any female be supposed to have seen them, either by\r\naccident or design, she is invariably executed, generally by poison, and\r\na father will not hesitate to sacrifice his daughter, or a husband his\r\nwife, on such an occasion.\r\n\r\n“They have many other prejudices with regard to women. They believe that\r\nif a woman, during her pregnancy, eats of any meat, any other animal\r\npartaking of it will suffer: if a domestic animal or tame bird, it will\r\ndie; if a dog, it will be for the future incapable of hunting; and even\r\na man will be unable to shoot that particular kind of game for the\r\nfuture. An Indian, who was one of my hunters, caught a fine cock of the\r\nrock, and gave it to his wife to feed, but the poor woman was obliged to\r\nlive herself on cassava-bread and fruits, and abstain entirely from all\r\nanimal food, peppers, and salt, which it was believed would cause the\r\nbird to die; notwithstanding all precautions however the bird did die,\r\nand the woman got a beating from her husband, because he thought she had\r\nnot been sufficiently rigid in her abstinence from the prohibited\r\narticles.”\r\n\r\nFew ethnological phenomena deserve more attention than the re-appearance\r\nof similar customs in the distant parts of the world, where, however,\r\nthe physical conditions are alike.\r\n\r\nBorneo and the Uaupés country, both are under the equator; and the same\r\nmode of building large houses for joint occupation prevails in both.\r\n\r\nObserve, too, the use of the blow-pipe; it appears equally on the\r\nAmazons and in Borneo.\r\n\r\nThe details of the group before us are as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe tattoed and painted individual with the skull of a slain enemy on a\r\npole, is a Mundrucu, of the River Tapajos, the most formidable,\r\nnumerous, and independent of the Brazilian Indians.\r\n\r\nWhen a Mundrucu has slain an enemy, he cuts off his head, extracts the\r\nbrain through the occipital _foramen_, washes the blood away, fills the\r\nskull with cotton, and then converts the whole into a kind of mummy, by\r\ndrying it before the fire. The eyes he gouges out, and he fills up the\r\norbits with colouring matter. Thus prepared, the head is placed outside\r\nhis hut. On festive occasions it is placed at the top of a spear. Such\r\nis the history of the head of an enemy. Those, however, of friends and\r\nrelations are preserved, and kept--though with certain differences of\r\ndetail. Thus, on certain days dedicated to the obsequies and memory of\r\nthe dead, the widow of the deceased takes his skull, seats herself\r\nbefore the cabin, and indulges either in melancholy lamentation, or in\r\nfierce encomium--the assembled friends meanwhile dancing round her.\r\n\r\nThe one behind is a Mura; the Muras being a numerous tribe, and from the\r\nvast extent of country over which they are spread, or rather scattered,\r\na tribe whose number seems greater than it is. Settled habitations they\r\nhave none; but, just as necessity or inclination takes them, they wander\r\nfrom wood to wood, from stream to stream. Taking the different divisions\r\nof them altogether, their number may amount to between 6000 and 7000\r\n“bows,” (this “bow” meaning “fighting-man;”) the rest of the population\r\nbeing in proportion. This gives us from 20,000 to 30,000 persons. The\r\nlower Madeira was their original area, but the lower Madeira was vexed\r\nand harassed by tribes of the powerful and hostile Mundrucus; and the\r\nMundrucus and Muras are ever at war with each other. At present the\r\nMundrucus are the superior population. They are bigger in body, and they\r\nare more closely allied to the Portuguese. Indeed the Portuguese used\r\nthem as a sort of military police against the Muras; who fear them so\r\nmuch that the presence of a single Mundrucu on board Von Martius’ canoe\r\nterrified a whole family of Muras.\r\n\r\nThe incursions, then, of the Mundrucus dispersed the Muras of the lower\r\nMadeira over vast districts on the Solimoes, and on the Rio Negro. Here\r\nthey are formidable as pirates. The Muras, with their associates, the\r\nToras (or Torayes), harass the navigation of the Amazons, where the\r\nsettlers and traders know them as the _Indios de Corso_, and attempt\r\ntheir extermination accordingly. When the stream gets narrow, and the\r\ncurrent strong, and the canoe has to labour slowly against the stream of\r\na mighty river, the Mura places himself on the banks, and lies in wait,\r\n_turé_ in hand. The _turé_ is an instrument, half wood and half reed,\r\nmade out of the bamboo, the transverse septum of which is pierced in its\r\ncentre. Here is inserted a second piece of cane, split. The _turé_ is\r\nheard at a considerable distance, and the watchman that blows it has a\r\ntree for a watch-tower. The _turé_, too, is the instrument to which they\r\ndance, and sing, and drink, at their festivals.\r\n\r\nLess formidable than they once were, the Mura is still shy, indocile,\r\nintractable, and impracticable as a labourer. Nothing but liquor will\r\ntempt him; and liquor tempts him but little in the way of work. He hunts\r\nskilfully, and he fishes skilfully; but he is rarely provident enough to\r\neconomise the results of any successful exertions for the future. He\r\ngorges himself when he is in luck, and starves when out of it; he thinks\r\nof the passing time only.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the Indians of the Amazons neither respect the female\r\nsex, nor vex themselves with jealousy on account of them. The Muras are\r\nsaid to be exceptions. The number of wives is two or three, and of these\r\nthe youngest is the favoured one. The other is little more than a\r\ndomestic drudge. To win them, the Mura must have fought at fisticuffs;\r\nfor a battle of this kind always takes place whenever a young lady\r\nbecomes marriageable. Those who enter into the list for possession,\r\nfight, and the winner carries her off.\r\n\r\nTheir language is harsh and guttural, and their speech is accompanied\r\nwith gesticulation. It is peculiar, at least it is different from the\r\n_Lingoa Geral_, which but few Muras understand. It has been stated that\r\nthe Mundrucus are their chief enemies. Besides these there are the\r\nMauhes, and the Catauxis--hostile also.\r\n\r\nThe use of the _paricá_ is one of the characteristic customs of the\r\nMuras. The _paricá_ is a powder. It is made from the dried seeds of a\r\nkind of Inga. It is a narcotic stimulating in the first instance,\r\nsedative or depressing afterwards. Once a year there is a _paricá_\r\nfeast, where the “snuff” is indulged in to excess, and where the\r\nadditional stimulants of dance, and song, and fermented liquors are\r\nsuperadded.\r\n\r\nThe other Indians are from the northern bank, on the frontier of Brazil\r\nand Bolivia. They cannot be said to represent any particular tribe. If\r\nthey give an idea of the general character of a South American Indian of\r\nthe parts in question it is sufficient. All the current descriptions are\r\nof this general character. The figures before us approach, however, the\r\n_Ticunas_ Indians of Osculati, the nearest. Ticunas, however, is a term\r\nof a somewhat lax import; inasmuch as it means any of the Indians who\r\nuse the Ticunas poison, or come from the country which produces it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weapons, &c., from the Amazons.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP XI.\r\n\r\nINDIANS FROM BRITISH GUIANA.\r\n\r\nThese are from casts taken from life during Sir R. Schomburgk’s\r\nexpedition. All belong to the great Carib stock, and speak dialects of\r\nthe widely-spread Carib language.\r\n\r\nThis is a point of importance. In _Brazil_ the predominant language is\r\nthe one alluded to under the name of _Tupi_--the basis of the _Lingoa\r\nGeral_ (_General Language_) or _Lingua Franca_.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, the leading characteristics are the same, or similar;\r\nthe details being more or less different. Some tribes, for instance,\r\nflatten the head, or tattoo the body; which the others do not. Some\r\nburn, others bury the dead. With the Carabisi, for instance, in ordinary\r\ncases the hammock in which the death took place, serves as a coffin, the\r\nbody is buried, and the funeral procession made once or twice round the\r\ngrave; but the bodies of persons of importance are watched and washed by\r\nthe nearest female relations, and when nothing but the skeleton remains,\r\nthe bones are cleaned, painted, packed in a basket and preserved. When,\r\nhowever, there is a change of habitation they are _burned_; after which\r\nthe ashes are collected, and kept.\r\n\r\nThe _Macusi_, on the other hand, buries his dead in a sitting posture\r\nwithout coffins, and with but few ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe Arawak custom is peculiar. When a man of note dies, his relations\r\nplant a field of cassava. They lament loudly. But when twelve moons are\r\nover, and the cassava is ripe, they reassemble, feast, dance, lash each\r\nother cruelly, and severely with whips. The whips are then _hung up_ on\r\nthe spot where the person died. Six moons later a second meeting takes\r\nplace; and this time the whips are _buried_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP XII.\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICANS DANCING.\r\n\r\nThis group gives us the general character of the more typical North\r\nAmerican Indians, rather than the details of any particular division;\r\nthe chief sources being the portraits in McKennedy’s Gallery, and some\r\nwell-executed daguerreotypes taken at St. Louis, and kindly placed at\r\nthe disposal of the Crystal Palace Company by Mr. Fitzherbert of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe prominence of the features, along with the red or copper tinge of\r\nthe skin, characterises the Americans before us. This contrasts them\r\nwith the Eskimo. Their size, on the other hand, distinguishes them from\r\nthe majority of the South American tribes. Nevertheless, the size\r\ndecreases as we go southward; and the Eskimo configuration (along with\r\nthe Eskimo habits) is approached as we move westward of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nNine-tenths, and perhaps a larger proportion of the Indians of the\r\nnorthern half of the United States are referable to one of three great\r\ngroups--the _Algonkin_, the _Iroquois_, the _Sioux_; each of which falls\r\ninto divisions and subdivisions.\r\n\r\nI. The _Algonkin_ is the greatest; greatest in respect to the number of\r\nits divisions and subdivisions, greatest in respect to the ground it\r\ncovers, and greatest in respect to the range of difference which it\r\nembraces.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Canadas, with one small exception, the whole of New\r\nBrunswick, Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and Prince Edward’s Isle, was\r\noriginally Algonkin, as were Labrador and Newfoundland to a great\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nTo the Algonkin stock belonged and belong the extinct and extant Indians\r\nof New England, part of New York, part of Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, part of the Carolinas, and part of even Kentucky and\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nThe Pequods, the Mohicans, the Narragansetts, the Massachuset, the\r\nMontaug, the Delaware, the Menomini, the Sauks, the Ottogamis, the\r\nKikkapùs, the Potawhotamis, the Illinois, the Miami, the Piankeshaws,\r\nthe Shawnos, &c. belong to this stock--all within the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Algonkins of British America are as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The _Crees_; of which the _Skofi_ and _Sheshatapúsh_ of Labrador are\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n2. The _Ojibways_; falling into--\r\n\r\n_a._ The _Ojibways Proper_, of which the _Sauteurs_ are a section.\r\n\r\n_b._ The _Ottawas_ of the River Ottawa.\r\n\r\n_c._ The original Indians of Lake _Nipissing_; important because it is\r\nbelieved that the form of speech called _Algonkin_, a term since\r\nextended to the whole class, was their particular dialect. They are now\r\neither extinct or amalgamated with other tribes.\r\n\r\n_d._ The _Messisaugis_, to the north of Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\n3. The _Micmacs_ of New Brunswick, Gaspé, Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and\r\npart of Newfoundland; closely allied to the--\r\n\r\n4. _Abnaki_ of Mayne, and the British frontier; represented at present\r\nby the _St. John’s Indians_.\r\n\r\n5. The _Bethuck_--the aborigines of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n6. The _Blackfoots_, consisting of the--\r\n\r\n_a._ _Satsikaa_, or _Blackfoots Proper_.\r\n\r\n_b._ The _Kena_, or _Blood Indians_.\r\n\r\n_c._ The _Piegan_.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added numerous extinct tribes.\r\n\r\nII. The _Iroquois_ class has been larger than it is now, many of its\r\nmembers being extinct. It still, however, contains the _Wiandots_, or\r\n_Hurons_, of the parts between Lakes Simcoe, Huron, and Erie; the once\r\nfamous and formidable _Mohawks_, the _Senekas_, the _Onondagos_, the\r\n_Cayugas_, the _Oneidas_, and the _Tuskaroras_.\r\n\r\nIII. To the _Sioux_ class belong the Assiniboins of the Red River, and\r\nthe Osages of Arkansas; tribes widely distant. It is the great Sioux to\r\nwhich nine-tenths of the Valley of Missouri originally belonged--Sioux,\r\nwhose original hunting-grounds included the vast prairie-country from\r\nthe Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi, and who again appear as an\r\nisolated detachment of Lake Michigan; Sioux, known under the names of\r\nWinebagoes, Dahcotas, Yanktons, Tetons, Upsarokas, Mandans, Minetaris,\r\nMissouris, Osages, Konzas, Ottos, Omahaws, Puncas, Ioways, and Quappas.\r\n\r\nNone of the Sioux tribes came in contact with the sea. None of them\r\nbelonged to the great _forest_ districts of America. Most of them hunt\r\nover the country of the buffalo. This makes them warlike migratory\r\nhunters; with fewer approaches to agricultural or industrial\r\ncivilisation than any Indians equally favoured by soil and climate.\r\n\r\nIt is the Iroquois, the Sioux, and certain members of the Algonkin\r\nstock, upon which the current and popular notions of the American\r\nIndian, the _Red Man_, as he is called, have been formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP XIII.\r\n\r\nGREENLANDERS.\r\n\r\nGreenland is occupied by the same family that occupies the coast of\r\nLabrador. It does more. It extends all along the northern coast of North\r\nAmerica; all along the shores of the Arctic Sea, both east and west. It\r\nextends to Russian America, and beyond it to the other side of Behring’s\r\nStraits, and to the Aleutian Islands. Hence, there are certain members\r\nof the family to which the Greenlanders belong in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe general name for this is _Eskimo_, a word, which, like _Malay_ and\r\n_Mongol_, is used in a general, as well as a particular sense. It\r\ndenotes a large family, and it means the special occupants of the coast\r\nof Labrador, and the coast of the Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo is the only family common to the Old and the New World.\r\n\r\nThe large Greenland tent, with its furniture, and a canoe, is from one\r\nof the few ethnological museums in existence,--that of Copenhagen; from\r\nwhich it has been liberally and courteously supplied to the Crystal\r\nPalace. The details are due to the skill and care of Professor Thomsen\r\nof that capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n1.

The\r\nanimals and plants of the British Isles, for example, are wholly\r\ndistinct from those of the West Indies, and these again from the East\r\nIndian kinds. Naturalists, after a long study of the distribution of\r\norganised beings, have been enabled to divide the earth’s surface into\r\nprovinces, each characterised by its peculiar set of inhabitants. The\r\nassemblage of organised beings in each province exhibits, when viewed\r\n_en masse_, a general aspect, or _facies_, independent of its being\r\ncomposed, in part, of kinds of creatures different from those found in\r\nany other province. This facies depends on combinations of colour,\r\nsculpture, texture, and often minute and insignificant characters, when\r\nregarded separately, but when presented in coordination, becoming of\r\nimportance through their constancy and their influence in determining\r\nthe leading features of a fauna or flora, or both combined. Even when\r\ncomparatively few of the characteristic animal and vegetable types of a\r\nprovince are brought together, within a limited space, some notion may\r\nthus be conveyed to the spectator of the _facies_, or aspect of life in\r\nthat region. This has been attempted in the arrangement of the\r\nGeographical Garden in the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nOrganised beings are distributed over the earth and in the sea\r\n_horizontally_ and _vertically_. On their horizontal distribution depend\r\ntheir geographical life-provinces; on their vertical distribution, their\r\narrangement in altitudinal and bathymetrical zones or belts. If we\r\nascend any high mountain, we rise through successive belts of\r\nvegetation, each frequented by its favourite form of animal life. We are\r\nreminded during our ascent of the successive faunas and floras that we\r\nshould pass amongst, were we proceeding from the mountain’s base to the\r\npole. If the mountain be sufficiently high, we at length reach a region\r\nwhere all life ceases. So likewise in the sea--if we explore the depths\r\nof ocean, and commence our examination on the borders of the shore, we\r\nshall find that the animal and vegetable population of the waters are\r\nnot dispersed indifferently through their depths, but occupy successive\r\nlevels, or zones. If we go deep enough, vegetable life first disappears,\r\nand animal species become so few, comparatively, that we cannot but\r\nconclude that we are approaching a point beyond, or rather below which\r\nall is desert.\r\n\r\nAs yet, no attempt has been made in the Crystal Palace to display the\r\nzones of altitude, though it is quite possible to do so, by means of a\r\nminiature mountain encircled by belts of alpine vegetation, amid which\r\nthe characteristic animals of the zones might be placed in relative\r\norder of elevated dwelling-places. This may be looked forward to, as a\r\nworthy object for carrying out hereafter. A slight and partial\r\nindication of the phenomena of distribution of marine animals in depth,\r\nis exhibited in cases representing the sea-population of a few regions;\r\nespecially the British, the West Indian, and Australian seas. In these\r\nthe spectator will observe that the law of distribution in provinces\r\nholds good among marine animals as among terrestrial. And if we regard\r\nthe peculiar features of the contents of the West Indian case,\r\ncontrasting it with that filled with British sea-animals, a striking\r\nexample of the difference of _facies_, or general aspect, in a temperate\r\nprovince as contrasted with a tropical one, is too evident not to\r\nattract our notice. Differences of the same kind are displayed in the\r\ncontrasts of form and colour presented by the birds of different\r\nregions, inclosed in the cases placed at intervals among the plants, and\r\nalways in connection with the other illustrations of the portions of the\r\nglobe to which they belong.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTERN OR OLD WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe Boar-hunt, one of the relics of the Great Exhibition of 1851, placed\r\nbeyond this Court, must be accepted as a type of Europe--a region so\r\nfamiliar to all, that no space has been spared for its fuller\r\nillustration. The OLD WORLD Court is consequently devoted to African and\r\nAsiatic illustrations. The several provinces of Africa are fairly\r\ntypified, but those of Asia, great and important though they be, have,\r\nfor the present, an inadequate share of space assigned.\r\n\r\nThe southernmost portion of this Court is occupied by the south\r\nextremity of Africa; to this we pass southwards through the northern\r\nAfrican provinces of Egypt and Barbary, brought into unavoidable\r\nproximity with the tropical countries of Asia. Central and Eastern\r\nAfrica follow, the latter having affinities with Asia through Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe visitor when beside the North African section of the Court must\r\nsuppose the proximity of Southern Europe, and by doing so, bear in mind\r\nthe close affinity that exists between the mass of vegetation that he\r\nthen sees around him, and the floras of Italy and Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL ASIA.\r\n\r\nThe yak and Ovis Ammon stand as representatives of the central regions\r\nof Asia. The former is a characteristic animal of Tibet, and does not\r\nthrive except at high elevations. Here, too, is placed the Bactrian\r\ncamel. The vegetation among which these animals are grouped is mainly\r\nHimalayan, and may be regarded as representing the flora of the verge of\r\nthis great province.\r\n\r\nBeyond the northern bounds of the Central Asiatic region, we pass\r\nrapidly amid European types, mingling, as we proceed eastwards, with\r\nBoreal American forms. The vegetation, like the animal life, puts on a\r\nmixed aspect, and one of a transatlantic character. In the main, the\r\nSiberian fauna and flora are linked with those of eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe arctic portion of Asia presents the characteristic assemblage of\r\npolar animals, white bears, seals, walruses, narwhals, dolphins, gulls,\r\nand cormorants, whilst along the shores range reindeer, arctic foxes,\r\nlemmings, ptarmigans, and snowy owls; more inland, wolves and otters,\r\nwith fur-bearing animals abound. This is the linking region of the Old\r\nand New Worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\nThe group of the Tiger-hunt indicates some of the zoological features of\r\nthe low country and jungles of India and the warm regions of Asia. The\r\ntiger is indeed one of the most characteristic animals of the Tropical\r\nAsiatic provinces, as is also the Indian elephant. The one-horned\r\nrhinoceros, the Indian hyæna, humped oxen of various kinds, a few\r\npeculiar deer, the scaly ant-eater, the bonnet-monkey, the Hoonuman\r\n(_Semnopithecus entellus_), and the wanderoo, are all well-marked and\r\nconspicuous Indian mammals. Some of the larger quadrupeds are common to\r\nEurope and Africa. The birds of India are numerous, and often very\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nBy bamboos and orange-trees, and a few forms of vegetation capable of\r\ncultivation under the conditions and within the space of our Garden, a\r\nvery slight indication indeed is afforded of the general Indian flora.\r\nBut in the back-ground of the Indian group, the rich assemblage of\r\nIndian rhododendrons and azaleas, the _Juniperus recurva_ and the _Ficus\r\nelastica_, serve to represent one of the most beautiful floras in the\r\nworld, that of the mountain ranges of India, whilst on its eastern-side,\r\ncamellias, tea-plants, Carphon laurels, and magnolias exemplify the\r\nchange in Asiatic vegetation with the great Chinese province.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\nThe portion of this continent, north of Sahara, west of the Libyan\r\ndesert, and including the chains of the Atlas, is clothed with a very\r\ndifferent vegetation, and peopled by a distinct set of land animals from\r\nthose occupying the greater and more characteristic African regions. In\r\nmany respects, it has more affinity in its natural history and features\r\nwith the southern countries of Europe, especially Spain and Sicily, than\r\nwith Africa. Even its most characteristic mammal, the Barbary ape, has\r\napparently an indigenous stronghold in Gibraltar. The wild boar, genet,\r\nporcupine, and fallow deer, the last alone of its tribe in Africa,\r\nindicate European affinities, whilst southern relations are marked by a\r\nfew forms of antelope and by the lion. Some small rodents are peculiar.\r\nThe traveller passing from temperate Europe to Barbary, sees in the\r\ndomesticated camel and many plants--the date-palm, the opuntia, and the\r\nagave--distinguishing and peculiar features of its landscape; yet none\r\nof these is an original native of the region. Even the date-palm belongs\r\nproperly to the countries south of the Atlas. The truly characteristic\r\nplants--such as the carob, fig, and palmetto, are all of Mediterranean\r\ntypes and South European forms. The sea that separates Europe and Africa\r\nhas an uniform population nearly throughout; and, in the main, is not\r\nmore than a colony of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH-EASTERN AND EASTERN AFRICA.\r\n\r\nEgypt is a truly African province, and is linked by many of its\r\nproductions with Nubia, Abyssinia, and the countries that border on the\r\nIndian Ocean. The crocodile and the hippopotamus, now confined to the\r\nhigher portions of the Nile, are essentially African types. The fishes\r\nof the Nile have close affinities with those of the rivers of the\r\nSenegal streams. Among them the polypterus is remarkable for its\r\napproach to the ancient and extinct forms of ganoids. From Sennaar,\r\nsouthwards, we find the elephant and one-horned rhinoceros. Monkeys,\r\nspecies of _Cercopithecus_, occur in the same region.\r\n\r\nIn the highlands of Shoa, the undulating surfaces of the table-lands are\r\ncovered with green bushes of euphorbia; lions and hyænas are common. In\r\nthe lower country of the Danakils, palms abound, with acacias and aloes;\r\nand the wart-hog, small antelopes and guinea-fowls, are among the\r\nanimals. Crocodiles and hippopotami haunt the streams and marshes. On\r\nthe plains are the Koodoo antelope and zebra; ostriches are hunted below\r\nthe Galla country, and leopards and buffaloes abound.\r\n\r\nTaking the vegetation from the north southwards, not a few conspicuous\r\nplants are distinctive of successive districts; thus, the date-palm, the\r\npapyrus, and the bean of Pythygoras may be cited for Egypt Proper; the\r\ndoom, the coffee, and acacias to the more southern provinces. Some\r\ncurious affinities with South African vegetation are indicated by\r\nAbyssinian species of pelargonium and protea.\r\n\r\nThere is a close relationship between the natural history of the Eastern\r\nAfrican region and that of Arabia; so near, indeed, that in many\r\nrespects we may regard these provinces as subdivisions of one great\r\nregion. Many of the most striking plants are common to both, and the\r\nsame may be said of not a few characteristic animals. The Red Sea, that\r\nseparates them, proves, when its animal and vegetable inhabitants are\r\nexplored, to be only a colony of the great Indian Ocean marine province,\r\nthe most extensive of all the natural-history regions of the ocean, and\r\nthe most varied in its contents. These are remarkable for brilliancy of\r\ncolouring and beauty or singularity of shape and sculpture, as well as\r\nfor the richness of the fauna in the number of generic and specific\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN AFRICA.\r\n\r\nWestern Africa within the tropics constitutes in many respects one vast\r\nnatural-history province, extending far into the interior and towards\r\nthe eastern coasts. This wide-spreading region is capable of being\r\nsubdivided, and the steaming districts along the coast from Senegal to\r\nCongo present numerous peculiarities that are not seen in the inland\r\nportions. These latter again vary considerably in features of surface,\r\nand the animal and vegetable population must change more or less\r\naccordingly. But throughout this portion of the African continent there\r\nrange not a few of the large quadrupeds, and doubtless of the smaller\r\nones and other tribes along with them. The African elephant, the\r\nhippopotamus, the two-horned rhinoceros, the phascochœrus, or wart-hog,\r\nthe lion and the jackal, are examples; although the Great Desert cuts\r\noff the range northwards of several of them. Among birds, the ostrich\r\nand the _Vultur kolbii_ are instances.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous zoological peculiarities of this region are\r\nmanifested by quadrumanous and edentate quadrupeds. This is a country of\r\nmonkeys, and of very remarkable ones. The thumbless apes (_Colobus_) are\r\nconcentrated here. The various herds of _Cercopithecus_ are chiefly\r\nmembers of this region: the mandrills are all belonging to it, and the\r\nbaboons abound. The African orang-outang is a native of Guinea; and\r\nthree species of chimpanzee are found on the same line of coast.\r\n\r\nThe edentata of this region are confined to the countries in the\r\nneighbourhood of the coast, and though few are highly peculiar. There\r\nare species of the genus _Manis_, the scaly ant-eater, or pangolin. In\r\nthe presence of these extraordinary quadrupeds along the western shores\r\nof Africa we seem to have a relation with the New World shadowed out;\r\none that is also indicated by a few analogies among the plants. At the\r\nsame time, by similar indications, a relationship of analogy with the\r\nIndian region may be traced. Thus, there are curious resemblances\r\nbetween the flora of Congo, that of India, and of the islands of the\r\nIndian Ocean. These similitudes are the more remarkable since the\r\nphysical features of the country between the western and eastern coasts\r\nare such as scarcely to admit of any continuity of like vegetation or\r\nanimal population. With the flora of South Africa that of the west has\r\nbut very slight connection.\r\n\r\nA number of antelopes, though as we go northwards the species are less\r\nnumerous, manifest the distinguishing feature of the group of African\r\nruminants. In our group the harnessed and Isabella antelopes typify this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of intertropical Africa varies considerably in different\r\ndistricts, on account of the striking difference in the mineral\r\nconstitution of the soil, and the elemental peculiarities of the seaward\r\nand inland districts. Palms of several kinds are abundant along the\r\ncoast countries, and among them the most prominent is the _Elais\r\nguiniensis_, a palm-oil species. As a group, however, although playing\r\nso prominent a part in the West African landscape, the number of kinds\r\nof palm is small, when compared with the vast number of individuals. The\r\n_Pandanus candelabrum_, one of the screw-palms, is a conspicuous tree.\r\nMangroves clothe the sides of swamps and the deltas of rivers. Towards\r\nthe inner country the great _Adansonia digitata_ or _Baobab_, the\r\nlargest tree in the world, becomes frequent, and ranges westwards to the\r\nboundaries of Abyssinia. The great tree-cotton, or _Bombax_, is also\r\ncharacteristic. Among the herbaceous plants that range along the western\r\ncoasts of Africa, one of the best known and prettiest is the _Gloriosa\r\nsuperba_. _Cinchoniaceæ_ and _Malvaceæ_ are among the tribes of plants\r\nthat attain a considerable development.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\nThere are few tracts of land on the earth’s surface so distinctly marked\r\nby zoological and botanical peculiarities, and by a striking aspect of\r\nfauna and flora as South Africa. Its mountains--and they attain\r\nconsiderable elevation, as much as 10,000 feet in some instances--its\r\nlow grounds, sandy plains, and deserts called Karoos, if not everywhere\r\nadorned with a luxuriant vegetation, are singularly prolific in\r\nremarkable and interesting plants, and are the resorts of numerous\r\nquadrupeds, many of them of considerable dimensions. In its mammalia and\r\nits flowering plants we recognise the prominent and distinctive\r\nnatural-history characteristics of the region.\r\n\r\nOne baboon, _Cynocephalus porcarius_, and a _Cercopithecus_, are the\r\nonly monkeys of the Cape region, and though peculiar as species, are\r\nrather to be regarded as links of the fauna of the South African with\r\nthe general fauna of Africa. In this light, too, must the carnivora be\r\nregarded, although numerous and prominent; for the most conspicuous, the\r\nlion for example, are common to a vast extent of the African continent.\r\nThe hyæna genus, however, may be regarded as having its metropolis in\r\nthis province. Some of the conspicuous pachyderms also appertain to the\r\ngeneral African group, such as the elephant, the hippopotamus, the\r\ntwo-horned rhinoceros, the Ethiopic hog, and the zebra. Here is the\r\ncountry of the gnoos and other antelopes, of quaggas, lions following in\r\nthe track; some of the antelopes may be seen in herds of hundreds.\r\n\r\nHere we are out of the region of palms; nor are large trees of any kind\r\nvery distinctive of the South African flora. There are no vast forests,\r\narborescent plants are scarce, but instead, there are great tracts of\r\nbush, composed, in the Caffrarian districts, for the most part of\r\nsucculent and thorny shrubs; leafless columnar euphorbias, some of them\r\nshaped like great candelabra and occasionally towering to thirty or\r\nforty feet, and fleshy aloes with threatening weapon-like leaves and\r\ntall standards of handsome flowers, give a strange and bizarre aspect to\r\nthe Bush-country vegetation, and cover with prickly thickets the steep\r\nsides of the ravines that furrow and separate the long flat ridges of\r\nhills. Here grow the _Zamia horrida_, the crane-like Strelitzia,\r\nprickly kinds of acacia, everlasting-flowers in great variety, and\r\nice-plants. One of the latter, the _Mesembryanthemum edule_, or\r\nHottentot fig, is the only native fruit, and a bad one at best.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Cape plants at once suggests to the lover of flowers a\r\nnumber of beautiful natives of the South African region: Cape lilies,\r\nvarious sorts of corn-flags, ixias, lobelias, oxalidiæ, peculiar\r\norchids, pelargoniums, diosmeas, polygalas, and heaths, of the last in\r\nwondrous variety. The curious little pachydermatous quadruped, _Hyrax\r\ncapensis_, is a specific peculiarity; so also is the quagga. It is the\r\ngroup of the hollow-formed ruminants that give the grand distinguishing\r\nfeature to the South African fauna. The beautiful family of antelopes\r\nattains its maximum here, nearly one half of the total number of species\r\nbeing South African. The gnoo, the eland, the harte-beest and\r\nspring-bok, are some of those most familiar on account of their\r\ndimensions or beauty: the abundance of antelopes compensates for the\r\nabsence of deer. The Cape buffalo (_Bos caffer_) is another distinctive\r\nruminant; and the giraffe, though ranging far to the north, is a\r\nconspicuous member of the southern fauna. The sand-flats around the Cape\r\nare bored by peculiar moles of the genus Bathyergus, and one of the most\r\ncurious of African animals, the Cape ant-eater, _Orycteropus capensis_,\r\none of the few members of its order existing in the Old World, is\r\nconfined to the province from which it derives its specific appellation.\r\nThe ornithological peculiarities of the Cape are not so striking.\r\n\r\nMany of the animals mentioned are now becoming scarce, or to be seen\r\nonly far in the interior. The elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus are\r\nrapidly disappearing through the persecution of the hunter. On the high\r\nopen table-lands of the interior immense multitudes of quadrupeds\r\ncongregate especially; and the proteaceæ, equally distinctive of this\r\nflora, abound most in the western districts of the colony, and are\r\nespecially numerous on the sandy plains. One of the most beautiful of\r\norchids, the famous _Disa grandiflora_, is a plant of Table Mountain.\r\nAmong remarkable plants may be mentioned, the waxberry, _Myrsia\r\ncordifolia_, a shrub, the berries of which are thickly coated with wax;\r\nand the well-known monstrous-looking _Testudinaria elephantipes_. The\r\nmuch-cultivated and familiar great White Arum, _Calla Æthiopica_, is\r\ncommon in wet places.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note, that whilst the animals, both quadrupeds and\r\nbirds, of South Africa have many relations with those of Western Africa\r\nwithin the tropics, the plants belong to completely a different series,\r\nand are connected with the flora of the rest of Africa only by eastern\r\nrelations. In some features of the flora there is a curious analogy\r\nmanifested with the Australian types.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of the Cape have a marine population as peculiar and striking\r\nin their way as the terrestrial, and constitute a well-marked\r\nsea-province, the eastern limits of which are to the south of Natal,\r\nwhere the great Indo-Pacific region meets that of the Cape. Among\r\nshell-fish, the limpet tribe has its chief congregation of species here.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN OR NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTARCTIC AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWe enter the NEW WORLD by the cold regions of the extreme south--the\r\nhome of penguins. Here we find forms of animal and vegetable life\r\nrepresentative of those that inhabit the Arctic regions and their\r\nborders. The most southerly arborescent vegetation is seen in Hermit\r\nIsland near Cape Horn, where stunted forests of antarctic and evergreen\r\nbeeches grow. The same phenomenon is exhibited of multiplication of\r\nindividuals and paucity of species to which attention will be called in\r\nthe notice of the extreme north. The southernmost of all flowering\r\nplants is a grass, the _Aira antarctica_, a native of the South Shetland\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERNMOST REGIONS.\r\n\r\nBy the Chilian auraucarias, the fuchsias, calceolarias, and petunias,\r\nsome of the peculiar features of the vegetation of the southernmost\r\nregions of South America are indicated. Many of our most beautiful and\r\nfamiliar garden plants come from these provinces. In the high regions of\r\nthe Andes of Chili, as well as further towards the equator, lives the\r\nchinchilla, famous for its fur, at an elevation of between 12,000 and\r\n14,000 feet--guinea-pigs are found of peculiar kinds, and the llama,\r\nwhich ranges to a height of 1800 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROPICAL SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe rich regions of Brazil and Tropical America are typified by some of\r\ntheir most characteristic vegetable forms, and by not a few of the most\r\nstriking members of their mammalian fauna, as well as birds of exquisite\r\nhues and strange shapes. Among the latter, the toucans and humming birds\r\nare singularly striking. This is the great central home of the New World\r\nmonkeys, contrasting with and representative of those of the Old World,\r\nbut constituting an entirely distinct group. Their nostrils placed far\r\napart and flattened, the number of their teeth, and the prehensile\r\ntail,--a fifth hand,--with which so many of them are endowed, give them\r\nan aspect very different from their relatives over the Atlantic. In the\r\nvast forests of Brazil they revel among the palms, Barringtonias and\r\nmonkey pots, whilst, on the ground below, the giant ant-eater, and many\r\nanother creature equally strange, prowls around the shade. The jaguar,\r\npuma, and ocelot, which take the place of the great cats of the Old\r\nWorld, the agouti and capabara, the sloth and coati-mundi, all present\r\nthemselves in this compartment. The American tapir is here, and in the\r\nmore western portions of the ground, are placed crochet-deer, and the\r\n_Rhea americana_, the ostrich of the west. The llama marks the region of\r\nthe Andes, and in the New World represents the camel of the Old.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\nBirds of beautiful plumage, and vegetation of singular and fantastic\r\nforms, mark the separating region of Central America. The cactus tribe\r\nof plants, the yuccas, and the great aloe or rather agave give a\r\npeculiar and striking aspect to this region. Yet of the larger forms of\r\nanimal life there is little to display. Before long we may show the\r\nstrange sea-cow, or manatee, as coming within the bounds of this\r\nprovince, and a glance at the West Indian marine case will serve at once\r\nto indicate the richness and beauty of the fauna of seas and shores. The\r\nnumber and curious variety of its sponges, the elegance and rich\r\npainting of its shell-fish, the odd shapes of its fishes, and the\r\npresence of striking forms of reef-building corals, all, however,\r\ndifferent from those of the Indian seas, cannot fail to impress its\r\npeculiarities on the thoughtful visitor.\r\n\r\nAlong the southern verge of this province is the country of that most\r\nexquisite of water-lilies, the great _Victoria_: on secluded lakes,\r\namong luxuriant forests, and in the reaches of the mighty rivers that\r\nflow tranquilly among them, this beautiful plant flourishes indigenous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATE NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nBetween the Central and the Arctic Provinces are the wooded regions of\r\nNORTH AMERICA, where the vegetation of Canada passes into that of the\r\nUnited States, and is bounded on the western side by Oregonian fauna. A\r\nwide range has to be illustrated in a small space, and we are obliged to\r\nbring together in close proximity the countries of the pines and the\r\npalmettos. The Canadian porcupine, Wapiti deer, elk, beaver, raccoon,\r\nVirginian opossum, and Virginian deer stand here as representatives for\r\nthe States and neighbouring countries. Shrew moles (Scalops aquaticus),\r\nstarnoses (Condylura cristata), musk-rats, bony pikes and limuli would\r\nbe effective additions, and highly characteristic. The fauna and flora\r\nof the United States, though in great part peculiar, are in many of\r\ntheir members curiously representative of the vegetable and animal life\r\nin the corresponding portion of the Old World; in not a few instances\r\nform replaces form. At the same time, the differences are not to be\r\noverlooked, and in the presence of the opossum, of some of the fishes\r\nand certain invertebrate animals, we seem to have indications of claims\r\nto a superior antiquity on the part of the so-called New, over the\r\nboasted Old World.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARREN GROUNDS.\r\n\r\nThe _Barren grounds_ that skirt the polar regions of North America, and\r\nwhich include the country to the east of the Rocky Mountains, and north\r\nof the great lakes, constitute a region of low hills with rounded\r\nsummits, and more or less precipitous sides, separated by narrow\r\nvalleys. They are bare of trees, except near the margins of larger\r\nrivers; a few stunted willows, dwarf birches and larches, are\r\noccasionally met with, but the greater part of the surface is covered\r\nwith lichens only. The brown bear, the glutton, the ermine, the Canadian\r\notter, the wolf, the zibet, the arctic hare, the reindeer, and the\r\nmusk-ox, are characteristic quadrupeds. Between this district and the\r\nnorthern shores of Lake Superior is a belt of wooded land, where the\r\nelk, squirrel, beaver, &c., occur. On the prairie lands that belong to\r\nthe next section are the great bison or American buffalo, peculiar deer,\r\nand the grisly bear. Towards the west, and along the Rocky Mountains are\r\nfound the American goat (only on the highest ridges), and the pretty\r\nprong-horned antelope. The distribution of most of these large animals\r\nis determined by the vegetation, and that in a great measure by the\r\ndisposition of the water-sheds.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCTIC REGIONS.\r\n\r\nTo realise our conceptions, we ought, before quitting the Geographical\r\nGarden from the north, to find ourselves surrounded by masses of ice and\r\nsnow. Let us picture in our minds long lines of hoary coasts, the dark\r\nrock occasionally breaking through its frosty covering, the deep green\r\nwaves tossing masses of ice, and bearing up towering and fantastic\r\nicebergs, whose cleft and cavernous sides are beautiful with intense\r\nblue shadows. Great whales sport among the waters, their black masses,\r\nhere and there, breaking the monotony of colours. Myriads of glancing\r\njellyfishes, iridescent beroes, and pearly molluscs, give animation to\r\nthe transparent waters. Flocks of sea-birds fly in every direction,\r\nwatching the fishes that supply them with abundant food; seals rest on\r\nthe icy platform, and nearer the land the great white bear, beautiful as\r\nstrong, prowls along the verge of the shore. A scene such as this cannot\r\nbe realised ever at Sydenham, but we can indicate some few of its\r\ncharacteristic elements. The imagination of intelligent visitors must\r\nsupply the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Province is represented only in one geographical Court, that\r\nof the Western or New World. The one indication must serve for all the\r\nregions that border the icy seas. Indeed there is no forcing in this\r\narrangement, for the entire Arctic fauna is characterised by prevailing\r\nmonotony. Myriads of individuals of the prevailing species, mostly dull\r\nin hue, or at least deficient in brilliant colouring, whether they\r\nbelong to the earth, the air, or the sea, compensate for the paucity of\r\ndifferent kinds. White and grey, in the air; dull browns in the sea, are\r\nthe prevailing tints. Some bright flowers during the summer season,\r\nbreak the modest rule by their gaiety. Throughout the icy seas, from\r\nGreenland round by Spitzbergen to Behring’s Straits, and along the\r\nlabyrinthine coast of Asiatic America to Greenland again, the same\r\nmarine animals are diffused. This is the region of the salmon genus, all\r\nthe species of which radiate, as it were, around the Arctic province.\r\n\r\nBy the polar bears and a group of Arctic birds an indication of this\r\nnorthernmost of faunas is afforded. The various foxes of the Arctic\r\nshores, the dogs of the Esquimaux, the walrus with its human head,\r\nwhalebone and finner whales, were their bulk admissible, would fill up\r\nthe group with more completeness. The reindeer serves to indicate the\r\nboundary of the province, and stands as a representative of the verge of\r\nthese realms of ice and snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA AND INDIAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation and much of the animal population of the Indian islands,\r\nboth on the land and in the sea, constitute a passage between the\r\nfloras and faunas of Asia, and those so exceedingly peculiar, when\r\nregarded apart, of Australia. The group of islands connected with New\r\nGuinea--mountainous, forest-clothed, hot and moist in their\r\nclimate--especially exhibit this passage. Spice-trees and numerous forms\r\nof palms mark differences; the presence of casuarinæ, gum-trees, and\r\nmelaleucas, resemblances. A few species of Australian types are highly\r\nsuggestive of the same relation.\r\n\r\nThe ourang, the Malay tapir, and bears, and the flying-squirrels, with a\r\nrich array of birds, illustrate the zoology of the Indian Archipelago;\r\nwhile that of Australia and Tasmania are indicated by the kangaroos,\r\nduck-billed platypus, Tasmanian wolf, and echidnas, with many of the\r\nsingular and strangely peculiar birds of this most remarkable zoological\r\nprovince, where we seem to have the lowest conditions of the vertebrate\r\ntype, assembled as if to indicate a rudimentary stage in the world’s\r\nhistory. The vegetation--typified here by Banksias and other proteaceous\r\nshrubs, epacridiæ, gum-trees, and many more forms as striking and\r\npeculiar--indicates a corner of the earth set apart.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADBURY AND EVANS, PRINTERS, WHITEFRIARS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOLOGY AND INHABITANTS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD\r\n\r\nTHE EXTINCT ANIMALS RESTORED BY B.

To accurate\r\ndrawings of these skeletons an outline of the form of the entire animal\r\nwas added, according to the proportions and relations of the skin and\r\nadjacent soft parts to the superficial parts of the skeleton, as yielded\r\nby those parts in the nearest allied living animals. From such an\r\noutline of the exterior, Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins prepared at once a\r\nminiature model form in clay.\r\n\r\nThis model was rigorously tested in regard to all its proportions with\r\nthose exhibited by the bones and joints of the skeleton of the fossil\r\nanimal, and the required alterations and modifications were successively\r\nmade, after repeated examinations and comparisons, until the result\r\nproved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to make a copy in clay of the proof model, of the\r\nnatural size of the extinct animal: the largest known fossil bone, or\r\npart, of such animal being taken as the standard according to which the\r\nproportions of the rest of the body were calculated agreeably with those\r\nof the best preserved and most perfect skeleton. The model of the full\r\nsize of the extinct animal having been thus prepared, and corrected by\r\nrenewed comparisons with the original fossil remains, a mould of it was\r\nprepared, and a cast taken from this mould, in the material of which the\r\nrestorations, now exposed to view, are composed.\r\n\r\nThere are some very rare and remarkable extinct animals of which only\r\nthe fossil skull and a few detached bones of the skeleton have been\r\ndiscovered: in most of these the restoration has been limited to the\r\nhead, as, for example, in the case of the Mosasaurus; and only in two\r\ninstances--those, viz., of the Labyrinthodon and Dicynodon--has Mr.\r\nHawkins taken upon himself the responsibility of adding the trunk to the\r\nknown characters of the head, such addition having been made to\r\nillustrate the general affinities and nature of the fossil, and the kind\r\nof limbs required to produce the impressions of the footprints, where\r\nthese have been detected and preserved in the petrified sands of the\r\nancient sea-shores trodden by these strange forms of the Reptilian\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the hair, the scales, the scutes, and other modifications\r\nof the skin, in some instances the analogy of the nearest allied living\r\nforms of animals has been the only guide; in a few instances, as in that\r\nof the Ichthyosaurus, portions of the petrified integument have been\r\nfortunately preserved, and have guided the artist most satisfactorily in\r\nthe restoration of the skin and soft parts of the fins; in the case of\r\nother reptiles, the bony plates, spines, and scutes have been discovered\r\nin a fossil state, and have been, scrupulously copied in the attempt to\r\nrestore the peculiar tegumentary features of the extinct reptiles, as\r\n_e.g._ in the Hylæosaurus.\r\n\r\nIn every stage of this difficult, and by some it may be thought,\r\nperhaps, too bold, attempt to reproduce and present to human gaze and\r\ncontemplation the forms of animal life that have successively flourished\r\nduring former geological phases of time, and have passed away long ages\r\nprior to the creation of man, the writer of the following brief notice\r\nof the nature and affinities of the animals so restored feels it a duty,\r\nas it is a high gratification to him, to testify to the intelligence,\r\nzeal, and peculiar artistic skill by which his ideas and suggestions\r\nhave been realised and carried out by the talented director of the\r\nfossil department, Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins. Without the combination of\r\nscience, art, and manual skill, happily combined in that gentleman, the\r\npresent department of the Instructive Illustrations at the Crystal\r\nPalace could not have been realised.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECONDARY ISLAND.\r\n\r\nThe most cursory observation of the surface of the earth shows that it\r\nis composed of distinct substances, such as clay, chalk, lias,\r\nlimestone, coal, slate, sandstone, &c.; and a study of such substances,\r\ntheir relative position and contents, has led to the conviction that\r\nthese external parts of the earth have acquired their present condition\r\ngradually, under a variety of circumstances, and at successive periods,\r\nduring which many races of animated beings, distinct both from those of\r\nother periods and from those now living, have successively peopled the\r\nland and the waters; the remains of these creatures being found buried\r\nin many of the layers or masses of mineral substances, forming the crust\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Islands in the Geological Lake is to demonstrate the\r\norder of succession, or superposition, of these layers or strata, and to\r\nexhibit, restored in form and bulk, as when they lived, the most\r\nremarkable and characteristic of the extinct animals and plants of each\r\nstratum.\r\n\r\nThe series of mineral substances and strata represented in the smaller\r\nisland have been called by geologists “secondary formations,” because\r\nthey lie between an older series termed “primary,” and a newer series\r\ntermed “tertiary:” the term “formation” meaning any assemblage of rocks\r\nor layers which have some character in common, whether of origin, age,\r\nor composition.[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] Lyell, “Manual of Elementary Geology.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the secondary formations as they descend in the earth, or\r\nsucceed each other from above downwards, and as they are shown,\r\nobliquely tilted up out of their original level position from left to\r\nright, in the Secondary Island, they consist: 1st, of the Chalk or\r\nCretaceous group; 2nd, the Wealden; 3rd, the Oolite; 4th, the Lias; and\r\n5th, the New Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHALK.\r\n\r\nThe chalk formations or “cretaceous group of beds” include strata of\r\nvarious mineral substances; but the white chalk which forms the cliffs\r\nof Dover and the adjoining coasts, and the downs and chalk quarries of\r\nthe South of England, is the chief and most characteristic formation.\r\nChalk, immense as are the masses in which it has been deposited, owes\r\nits origin to living actions; every particle of it once circulated in\r\nthe blood or vital juices of certain species of animals, or of a few\r\nplants, that lived in the seas of the secondary period of geological\r\ntime. White chalk consists of carbonate of lime, and is the result of\r\nthe decomposition chiefly of coral-animals (_Madrepores_, _Millepores_,\r\n_Flustra_, _Cellepora_, &c.), of sea-urchins (_Echini_), and of\r\nshell-fishes (_Testacea_), and of the mechanical reduction, pounding,\r\nand grinding of their shells. Such chalk-forming beings still exist, and\r\ncontinue their operations in various parts of the ocean, especially in\r\nthe construction of coral reefs and islands.\r\n\r\nEvery river that traverses a limestone district carries into the sea a\r\ncertain proportion of caustic lime in solution: the ill effects of the\r\naccumulation of this mineral are neutralised by the power allotted to\r\nthe above-cited sea-animals to absorb the lime, combine it with\r\ncarbonic-acid, and precipitate or deposit it in the condition of\r\ninsoluble chalk, or carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nThe entire cretaceous series includes from above downwards:\r\n\r\n  Maestricht beds of yellowish chalk.\r\n\r\n  Upper white chalk with flints.\r\n\r\n  Lower white chalk without flints.\r\n\r\n  Upper green-sand.\r\n\r\n  Gault.\r\n\r\n  Lower green-sand and Kentish rag.\r\n\r\nThe best known and most characteristic large extinct animal of the chalk\r\nformations is chiefly found in the uppermost and most recent division,\r\nand is called\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1.--THE MOSASAURUS.\r\n\r\n(_Mosasaurus Hoffmanni_, Hoffmann’s Mosasaur.)\r\n\r\nOf this animal almost the entire skull has been discovered, but not\r\nsufficient of the rest of the skeleton to guide to a complete\r\nrestoration of the animal. The head only, therefore, is shown, of the\r\nnatural size, at the left extremity of the Secondary Island.\r\n\r\nThe first or generic name of this animal is derived from the locality,\r\nMaestricht, on the river Meuse (Lat. _Mosa_), in Germany, where its\r\nremains have been chiefly discovered, and from the Greek, word _sauros_,\r\na lizard, to which tribe of animals it belongs. Its second name refers\r\nto its discoverer, Dr. Hoffmann, of Maestricht, surgeon to the forces\r\nquartered in that town in 1780. This gentleman had occupied his leisure\r\nby the collection of the fossils from the quarries which were then\r\nworked to a great extent at Maestricht for a kind of yellowish stone of\r\na chalky nature, and belonging to the most recent of the secondary class\r\nof formations in geology. In one of the great subterraneous quarries or\r\ngalleries, about five hundred paces from the entrance, and ninety feet\r\nbelow the surface, the quarrymen exposed part of the skull of the\r\nMosasaurus, in a block of stone which they were engaged in detaching. On\r\nthis discovery they suspended their work, and went to inform Dr.\r\nHoffmann, who, on arriving at the spot, directed the operations of the\r\nmen, so that they worked out the block without injury to the fossil; and\r\nthe doctor then, with his own hands, cleared away the matrix and exposed\r\nthe jaws and teeth, casts of which are shown in the cretaceous rock of\r\nthe Island.\r\n\r\nThis fine specimen, which Hoffmann had added with so much pains and care\r\nto his collection, soon, however, became a source of chagrin to him. One\r\nof the canons of the cathedral at Maestricht, who owned the surface of\r\nthe soil beneath which was the quarry whence the fossil had been\r\nobtained, when the fame of the specimen reached him, pleaded certain\r\nfeudal rights to it. Hoffmann resisted, and the canon went to law. The\r\nChapter supported the canon, and the decree ultimately went against the\r\npoor surgeon, who lost both his specimen and his money--being made to\r\npay the costs of the action. The canon did not, however, long enjoy\r\npossession of the unique specimen. When the French army bombarded\r\nMaestricht in 1795, directions were given to spare the suburb in which\r\nthe famous fossil was known to be preserved; and after the capitulation\r\nof the town it was seized and borne off in triumph. The specimen has\r\nsince remained in the museum of the Garden of Plants at Paris.\r\n\r\nThis skull of the Mosasaurus measures four and a half feet long and two\r\nand a half feet wide. The large pointed teeth on the jaws are very\r\nconspicuous; but, in addition to these, the gigantic reptile had teeth\r\non a bone of the roof of the mouth (the pterygoid), like some of the\r\nmodern lizards. The entire length of the animal has been estimated at\r\nabout thirty feet. It is conjectured to have been able to swim well, and\r\nto have frequented the sea in quest of prey: its dentition shows its\r\npredatory and carnivorous character, and its remains have hitherto been\r\nmet with exclusively in the chalk formations. Besides the specimens from\r\nSt. Peter’s Mount, Maestricht, of which the above-described skull is the\r\nmost remarkable, fossil bones and teeth of the Mosasaurus have been\r\nfound in the chalk of Kent, and in the green-sand--a member of the\r\ncretaceous series--in New Jersey, United States of America. No animal\r\nlike the Mosasaurus is now known to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nNos. 2 & 3.--THE PTERODACTYLE.\r\n\r\nNos. 2 and 3 are restorations of a flying reptile or dragon, called\r\nPterodactyle, from the Greek words _pteron_, a wing, and _dactylos_, a\r\nfinger; because the wings are mainly supported by the outer finger,\r\nenormously lengthened and of proportionate strength, which,\r\nnevertheless, answers to the little finger of the human hand. The wings\r\nconsisted of folds of skin, like the leather wings of the bat; and the\r\nPterodactyles were covered with scales, not with feathers: the head,\r\nthough somewhat resembling in shape that of a bird, and supported on a\r\nlong and slender neck, was provided with long jaws, armed with teeth;\r\nand altogether the structure of these extinct members of the reptilian\r\nclass is such as to rank them amongst the most extraordinary of all the\r\ncreatures yet discovered in the ruins of the ancient earth.\r\n\r\nRemains of the Pterodactyle were first discovered, in 1784, by Prof.\r\nCollini, in the lithographic slate of Aichstadt, in Germany, which slate\r\nis a member of the oolitic formations: the species so discovered was at\r\nfirst mistaken for a bird, and afterwards supposed to be a large kind of\r\nbat, but had its true reptilian nature demonstrated by Baron Cuvier, by\r\nwhom it was called the _Pterodactylus longirostris_, or Long-beaked\r\nPterodactyle: it was about the size of a curlew.\r\n\r\nA somewhat larger species--the _Pterodactylus macronyx_, or Long-clawed\r\nPterodactyle--was subsequently discovered by the Rev. Dr. Buckland, in\r\nthe lias formation of Lyme Regis: its wings, when expanded, must have\r\nbeen about four feet from tip to tip. The smallest known species--the\r\n_Pterodactylus brevirostris_, or Short-beaked Pterodactyle--was\r\ndiscovered in the lithographic slate at Solenhofen, Germany, and has\r\nbeen described by Professor Soemmering.\r\n\r\nRemains of the largest known kinds of Pterodactyle have been discovered\r\nmore recently in chalk-pits, at Burham, in Kent. The skull of one of\r\nthese species--the _Pterodactylus Cuvieri_--was about twenty inches in\r\nlength, and the animal was upborne on an expanse of wing of probably not\r\nless than eighteen feet from tip to tip. The restored specimen of this\r\nspecies is numbered 3.\r\n\r\nA second very large kind of Pterodactyle--the _Pterodactylus\r\ncompressirostris_, or Thin-beaked Pterodactyle--had a head from fourteen\r\nto sixteen inches in length, and an expanse of wing, from tip to tip, of\r\nfifteen feet. The remains of this species have also been found in the\r\nchalk of Kent. From the same formation and locality a third large kind\r\nof Pterodactyle, although inferior in size to the two foregoing, has\r\nbeen discovered, called the _Pterodactylus conirostris_, and also--until\r\nthe foregoing larger kinds were discovered--_Pterodactylus giganteus_.\r\nThe long, sharp, conical teeth in the jaws of the Pterodactyles indicate\r\nthem to have preyed upon other living animals; their eyes were large, as\r\nif to enable them to fly by night. From their wings projected fingers,\r\nterminated by long curved claws, and forming a powerful paw, wherewith\r\nthe animal was enabled to creep and climb, or suspend itself from trees.\r\nIt is probable, also, that the Pterodactyles had the power of swimming;\r\nsome kinds, _e.g._, the _Pterodactylus Gemmingi_, had a long and stiff\r\ntail. “Thus,” writes Dr. Buckland, “like Milton’s Fiend, all qualified\r\nfor all services and all elements, the creature was a fit companion for\r\nthe kindred reptiles that swarmed in the seas, or crawled on the shores\r\nof a turbulent planet.\r\n\r\n                                      ‘The Fiend,\r\n    O’er bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\r\n    With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,\r\n    And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.’\r\n\r\n  _Paradise Lost_, Book II.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEALDEN.\r\n\r\nThe Wealden is a mass of petrified clay, sand, and sandstone, deposited\r\nfrom the fresh or brackish water of probably some great estuary, and\r\nextending over parts of the counties of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. This\r\nfresh-water formation derives its name from the “Weald” or “Wold” of\r\nKent, where it was first geologically studied, and where it is exposed\r\nby the removal of the chalk, which covers or overlies it, in other parts\r\nof the South of England.\r\n\r\nThe Wealden is divided into three groups of strata, which succeed each\r\nother in the following descending order:--\r\n\r\n1st. Weald Clay, sometimes including thin beds of sand and shelly\r\nlimestone, forming beds of from 140 to 280 feet in depth or vertical\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n2nd. Hastings Sand, in which occur some clays and calcareous grits,\r\nforming beds of from 400 to 500 feet in depth.\r\n\r\n3rd. Purbeck Beds, so called from being exposed chiefly in the Isle of\r\nPurbeck, off the coast of Dorsetshire, where it forms the quarries of\r\nthe limestone for which Purbeck is famous: the beds of limestones and\r\nmarls are from 150 to 200 feet in depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNos. 4 & 5.--THE IGUANODON.\r\n\r\n(_Iguanodon Mantelli_, Conybeare.)\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, in the spring of 1822, an accomplished lady, the wife of\r\na medical practitioner, at Lewes, in Sussex, walking along the\r\npicturesque paths of Tilgate Forest, discovered some objects in the\r\ncoarse conglomerate rock of the quarries of that locality, which, from\r\ntheir peculiar form and substance, she thought would be interesting to\r\nher husband, whose attention had been directed, during his professional\r\ndrives, to the geology and fossils of his neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe lady was Mrs. Mantell: her husband, the subsequently distinguished\r\ngeologist, Dr. Mantell,[44] perceived that the fossils discovered by his\r\nwife were teeth, and teeth of a large and unknown animal.\r\n\r\n  [44] “The first specimens of the teeth were found by Mrs. Mantell in\r\n  the coarse conglomerate of the Forest, in the spring of\r\n  1822.”--Mantell, “Geology of the South-East of England,” 8vo, 1833, p.\r\n  268.\r\n\r\n“As these teeth,” writes the doctor, “were distinct from any that had\r\npreviously come under my notice, I felt anxious to submit them to the\r\nexamination of persons whose knowledge and means of observation were\r\nmore extensive than my own. I therefore transmitted specimens to some of\r\nthe most eminent naturalists in this country and on the continent. But\r\nalthough my communications were acknowledged with that candour and\r\nliberality which constantly characterise the intercourse of scientific\r\nmen, yet no light was thrown upon the subject, except by the illustrious\r\nBaron Cuvier, whose opinions will best appear by the following extract\r\nfrom the correspondence with which he honoured me:--\r\n\r\n“‘These teeth are certainly unknown to me; they are not from a\r\ncarnivorous animal, and yet I believe that they belong, from their\r\nslight degree of complexity, the notching of their margins, and the thin\r\ncoat of enamel that covers them, to the order of reptiles.\r\n\r\n“‘May we not here have a new animal!--a herbivorous reptile? And, just\r\nas at the present time with regard to mammals (land-quadrupeds with warm\r\nblood), it is amongst the herbivorous that we find the largest species,\r\nso also with the reptiles at the remote period when they were the sole\r\nterrestrial animals, might not the largest amongst them have been\r\nnourished by vegetables?\r\n\r\n“‘Some of the great bones which you possess may belong to this animal,\r\nwhich, up to the present time, is unique in its kind. Time will confirm\r\nor confute this idea, since it is impossible but that one day a part of\r\nthe skeleton, united to portions of jaws with the teeth, will be\r\ndiscovered.’”\r\n\r\n“These remarks,” Dr. Mantell proceeds to say, “induced me to pursue my\r\ninvestigations with increased assiduity, but hitherto they have not been\r\nattended with the desired success, no connected portion of the skeleton\r\nhaving been discovered. Among the specimens lately connected, some,\r\nhowever, were so perfect, that I resolved to avail myself of the\r\nobliging offer of Mr. Clift (to whose kindness and liberality I hold\r\nmyself particularly indebted), to assist me in comparing the fossil\r\nteeth with those of the recent Lacertæ in the Museum of the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons. The result of this examination proved highly\r\nsatisfactory, for in an Iguana which Mr. Stutchbury had prepared to\r\npresent to the College, we discovered teeth possessing the form and\r\nstructure of the fossil specimens.” (Phil. Trans., 1825, p. 180.) And he\r\nafterwards adds:--“The name Iguanodon, derived from the form of the\r\nteeth, (and which I have adopted at the suggestion of the Rev. W.\r\nConybeare,) will not, it is presumed, be deemed objectionable.” (Ib. p.\r\n184.)\r\n\r\nThe further discovery which Baron Cuvier’s prophetic glance saw buried\r\nin the womb of time, and the birth of which verified his conjecture that\r\nsome of the great bones collected by Dr. Mantell belonged to the same\r\nanimal as the teeth, was made by Mr. W. H. Bensted, of Maidstone, the\r\nproprietor of a stone-quarry of the Shanklin-sand formation, in the\r\nclose vicinity of that town. This gentleman had his attention one day,\r\nin May, 1834, called by his workmen to what they supposed to be\r\npetrified wood in some pieces of stone which they had been blasting. He\r\nperceived that what they supposed to be wood was fossil bone, and with a\r\nzeal and care which have always characterised his endeavours to secure\r\nfor science any evidence of fossil remains in his quarry, he immediately\r\nresorted to the spot. He found that the bore or blast by which these\r\nremains were brought to light, had been inserted into the centre of the\r\nspecimen, so that the mass of stone containing it had been shattered\r\ninto many pieces, some of which were blown into the adjoining fields.\r\nAll these pieces he had carefully collected, and proceeding with equal\r\nardour and success to the removal of the matrix from the fossils, he\r\nsucceeded after a month’s labour in exposing them to view, and in\r\nfitting the fragments to their proper places.\r\n\r\nThis specimen is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nMany other specimens of detached bones, including vertebræ or parts of\r\nthe back-bone, especially that part resting on the hind limbs, and\r\ncalled the “pelvis,” bones of the limbs, down to those that supported\r\nthe claws, together with jaws and teeth, which have since been\r\nsuccessively discovered, have enabled anatomists to reconstruct the\r\nextinct Iguanodon, and have proved it to have been a herbivorous\r\nreptile, of colossal dimensions, analogous to the diminutive Iguana in\r\nthe form of its teeth, but belonging to a distinct and higher order of\r\nreptiles, more akin to the crocodiles. The same rich materials,\r\nselecting the largest of the bones as a standard, have served for the\r\npresent restorations (Nos. 4 and 5) of the animal, as when alive: all\r\nthe parts being kept in just proportion to the standard bones, and the\r\nwhole being thus brought to the following dimensions:--\r\n\r\n  Total length, from the nose or muzzle to the end of\r\n  the tail                                             34 feet 9 inches.\r\n  Greatest girth of the trunk                          20   „  5    „\r\n  Length of the head                                    3   „  6    „\r\n  Length of the tail                                   15   „  6    „\r\n\r\nThe character of the scales is conjectural, and the horn more than\r\ndoubtful, though attributed to the Iguanodon by Dr. Mantell and most\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nThis animal probably lived near estuaries and rivers, and may have\r\nderived its food from the _Clathrariæ_, _Zamiæ_, _Cycades_, and other\r\nextinct trees, of which the fossil remains abound in the same formations\r\nas those yielding the bones and teeth of the Iguanodon.\r\n\r\nThese formations are the Wealden and the Neocomian or green-sand: the\r\nlocalities in which the remains of the Iguanodon have been principally\r\nfound, are the Weald of Kent and Sussex: Horsham, in Sussex; Maidstone,\r\nin Kent; and the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nRestorations of the _Cycas_ and _Zamia_ are placed, with the Iguanodon,\r\non the Wealden division of the Secondary Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 6.--THE HYLÆOSAURUS. (_Hylæosaurus Owenii._)\r\n\r\nThe animal, so called by its discoverer, Dr. Mantell, belongs to the\r\nsame highly organised order of the class of reptiles as the Iguanodon,\r\nthat, viz., which was characterised by a longer and stronger sacrum and\r\npelvis, and by larger limbs than the reptiles of the present day\r\npossess; they were accordingly better fitted for progression on dry\r\nland, and probably carried their body higher and more freely above the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\nVisiting, in the summer of 1832, a quarry in Tilgate Forest, Dr. Mantell\r\nhad his attention attracted to some fragments of a large mass of stone,\r\nwhich had recently been broken up, and which exhibited traces of\r\nnumerous pieces of bone. The portions of the rock, which admitted of\r\nbeing restored together, were cemented, and then the rock was chiselled\r\nfrom the fossil bones, which consisted of part of the back-bone or\r\nvertebral column, some ribs, the shoulder bones called scapula and\r\ncoracoid, and numerous long angular bones or spines which seemed to have\r\nsupported a lofty serrated or jagged crest, extended along the middle of\r\nthe back, as in some of the small existing lizards, _e.g._, the Iguana:\r\ncut No. 6. Many small dermal bones were also found, which indicate the\r\nHylæosaurus to have been covered by hard tuberculate scales, like those\r\nof some of the Australian lizards, called _Cyclodus_.\r\n\r\nThis character of the skin, and the serrated crest, are accurately given\r\nin the restoration, the major part of which, however, is necessarily at\r\npresent conjectural, and carried out according to the general analogies\r\nof the saurian form. The size is indicated with more certainty according\r\nto the proportions of the known vertebræ and other bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 6. Diagram of the Slab containing the Bones of\r\nHylæosaurus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OOLITE.\r\n\r\nThe division of the secondary formations, called “Oolite,” takes its\r\nname from the most characteristic of its constituents, which is a\r\nvariety of limestone composed of numerous small grains, resembling the\r\n“roe” or eggs of a fish, whence the term, (from the Greek _oon_, an egg,\r\n_lithos_, a stone). The oolite, however, includes a great series of beds\r\nof marine origin, which, with an average breadth of thirty miles, extend\r\nacross England, from Yorkshire in the north-east to Dorsetshire in the\r\nsouth-west.\r\n\r\nThe oolite series lies below the Wealden, and where this is wanting,\r\nbelow the chalk, and consists of the following subdivisions, succeeding\r\neach other in the descending order:--\r\n\r\nOOLITE.\r\n\r\n  Upper.  {Portland stone and sand.\r\n          {Kimmeridge clay.\r\n\r\n  Middle. {Coral rag.\r\n          {Oxford clay.\r\n\r\n          {Cornbrash and forest marble.\r\n  Lower.  {Great oolite and Stonesfield slate.\r\n          {Fuller’s earth.\r\n          {Inferior oolite.\r\n\r\nUpon the portion of the island representing the oolite series, the most\r\nconspicuous of the restored animals of that period is--\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 7.--THE MEGALOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThe Megalosaurus, as its name implies (compounded by its discoverer, Dr.\r\nBuckland, from the Greek _megas_, great, and _sauros_, lizard), was a\r\nlizard-like reptile of great size, “of which,” writes Dr. Buckland,\r\n“although no skeleton has yet been found entire, so many perfect bones\r\nand teeth have been discovered in the same quarries, that we are nearly\r\nas well acquainted with the form and dimensions of the limbs as if they\r\nhad been found together in a single block of stone.”\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the animal has been accordingly effected, agreeably\r\nwith the proportions of the known parts of the skeleton, and in harmony\r\nwith the general characters of the order of reptiles to which the\r\nMegalosaurus belonged. This order--the Dinosauria (Gr. _deinos_,\r\nterribly great _sauros_, a lizard)--is that to which the two foregoing\r\nhuge reptiles of the Wealden series belong, viz., the Iguanodon and\r\nHylæosaurus, and is characterised by the modifications already\r\nmentioned, that fitted them for more efficient progression upon dry\r\nland. The Iguanodon represented the herbivorous section of the order,\r\nthe Hylæosaurus appears, from its teeth, to have been a mixed feeder,\r\nbut the Megalosaurus was decidedly carnivorous, and, probably, waged a\r\ndeadly war against its less destructively endowed congeners and\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 7. Megalosaurus.]\r\n\r\nBaron Cuvier estimated the Megalosaurus to have been about fifty feet in\r\nlength; my own calculations, founded on more complete evidence than had\r\nbeen at the Baron’s command, reduce its size to about thirty-five\r\nfeet:[45] but with the superior proportional height and capacity of\r\ntrunk, as contrasted with the largest existing crocodiles, even that\r\nlength gives a most formidable character to this extinct predatory\r\nreptile.\r\n\r\n  [45] “Report of British Fossil Reptiles,” 1841, p. 110.\r\n\r\nAs the thigh-bone (_femur_) and leg-bone (_tibia_) measure each nearly\r\nthree feet, the entire hind-leg, allowing for the cartilages of the\r\njoints, must have attained a length of two yards: a bone of the foot\r\n(metatarsal) thirteen inches long, indicates that part, with the toes\r\nand claws entire, to have been at least three feet in length. The form\r\nof the teeth shows the Megalosaurus to have been strictly carnivorous,\r\nand viewed as instruments for providing food for so enormous a reptile,\r\nthe teeth were fearfully fitted to the destructive office for which they\r\nwere designed. They have compressed conical sharp-pointed crowns, with\r\ncutting and finely serrated anterior and posterior edges; they appear\r\nstraight, as seen when they had just protruded from the socket, but\r\nbecome bent slightly backwards in the progress of growth, and the fore\r\npart of the crown, below the summit, becomes thick and convex.\r\n\r\nA minute and interesting description of these teeth will be found in Dr.\r\nBuckland’s admirable “Bridgewater Treatise” (vol. i. p. 238), from which\r\nhe concludes that the teeth of the Megalosaurus present “a combination\r\nof contrivances analogous to those which human ingenuity has adopted in\r\nthe construction of the knife, the sabre, and the saw.” The fossils\r\nwhich brought to light the former existence of this most formidable\r\nreptile, were discovered in 1823, in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield,\r\nnear Oxford, and were described by Dr. Buckland, in the volume of the\r\n“Geological Transactions” for the year 1824.\r\n\r\nRemains of the Megalosaurus have since been discovered in the “Bath\r\noolite,” which is immediately below the Stonesfield slate, and in the\r\n“Cornbrash,” which lies above it. Vertebræ, teeth, and some bones of the\r\nextremities have been discovered in the Wealden of Tilgate Forest, Kent,\r\nand in the ferruginous sand, of the same age, near Cuckfield, in Sussex.\r\nRemains of the Megalosaurus also occur in the Purbeck limestone at\r\nSwanage Bay, and in the oolite in the neighbourhood of Malton, in\r\nYorkshire.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterhouse Hawkins’s restoration, according to the proportions\r\ncalculated from the largest portions of fossil bones of the Megalosaurus\r\nhitherto obtained, yields a total length of the animal, from the muzzle\r\nto the end of the tail, of thirty-seven feet; the length of the head\r\nbeing five feet, the length of the tail fifteen feet; and the greatest\r\ngirth of the body twenty-two feet six inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nNos. 8 & 9.--PTERODACTYLES OF THE OOLITE.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the Hylæosaurus, on the rock representing the greater\r\noolite formation, are restorations of species of Pterodactyle\r\n(_Pterodactylus Bucklandi_, No. 9), smaller than and distinct from those\r\nof the chalk formations. The remains of Buckland’s Pterodactyle are\r\nfound pretty abundantly in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield, near\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n\r\nNos. 10 & 11.--TELEOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nOn the shore beneath the overhanging cliff of oolitic rock are two\r\nrestorations, Nos. 10 and 11, of a large extinct kind of crocodile, to\r\nwhich the long and slender-jawed crocodile of the Ganges, called\r\n“Gaviàl” or “Gharriàl” by the Hindoos, offers the nearest resemblance at\r\nthe present day. Remains of the ancient extinct British gavials have\r\nbeen found in most of the localities where the oolitic formations occur,\r\nand very abundantly in the lias cliffs near Whitby, in Yorkshire. The\r\nname Teleosaurus (_telos_, the end, _sauros_, a lizard), was compounded\r\nfrom the Greek by Professor Geoffroy St. Hilaire, for a species of these\r\nfossil gavials, found by him in the oolite stone at Caen, in Normandy,\r\nand has reference to his belief that they formed one--the\r\nearliest--extreme of the crocodilian series, as this series has been\r\nsuccessively developed, in the course of time on our planet.\r\n\r\nThe jaws are armed with numerous long, slender, sharp-pointed, slightly\r\ncurved teeth, indicating that they preyed on fishes, and the young or\r\nweaker individuals of co-existing reptiles. The nostril is situated more\r\nat the end of the upper jaw than in the modern gavial: the fore-limbs\r\nare shorter, and the hind ones longer and stronger than in the gavial,\r\nwhich indicates that the Teleosaur was a better swimmer; the vertebræ or\r\nbones of the back are united by slightly concave surfaces, not\r\ninterlocked by cup and ball joints as in the modern crocodiles, whence\r\nit would seem that the Teleosaur lived more habitually in the water, and\r\nless seldom moved on dry land; and, as its fossil remains have been\r\nhitherto found only in the sedimentary deposits from the sea, it may be\r\ninferred that it was more strictly marine than the crocodile of the\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\nThe first specimen of a Teleosaur that was brought to light was from the\r\n“alum-schale” which forms one layer of the lofty lias cliffs of the\r\nYorkshire coast, near Whitby. A brief description, and figures, of this\r\nincomplete fossil skeleton were published by Messrs. Wooller and\r\nChapman, in separate communications, in the 50th volume of the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions,” in 1758. Captain Chapman observes, “it\r\nseems to have been an alligator;” and Mr. Wooller thought “it resembled\r\nin every respect the Gangetic gavial.” Thus, nearly a century ago, the\r\ntrue nature of the fossil was almost rightly understood, and various\r\nwere the theories then broached to account for the occurrence of a\r\nsupposed Gangetic reptile in a petrified state in the cliffs of\r\nYorkshire. It has required the subsequent progress of comparative\r\nanatomy to determine, as by the characters above defined, the essential\r\ndistinction of the Teleosaur from all known existing forms of\r\ncrocodilian reptiles.\r\n\r\nVery abundant remains, and several species, of the extinct genus have\r\nbeen subsequently discovered: but always in the oolitic and liassic\r\nformations of the secondary series of rocks.\r\n\r\nThe oolitic group of rocks are very rich in remains of both plants and\r\nanimals: many reptiles of genera and species distinct from those here\r\nrestored have been recognised and determined by portions of the\r\nskeleton. Extremely numerous are the remains of fishes, chiefly of an\r\nalmost extinct order (_Ganoidei_), characterised by hard, shining,\r\nenamelled scales. But the most remarkable fossils are those which\r\nindisputably prove the existence, during the period of the “Great” or\r\n“Lower Oolite,” of insectivorous and marsupial mammalia--_i.e._, of\r\nwarm-blood quadrupeds, which, like the shrew or hedgehog, fed on\r\ninsects, and, like the opossum, had a pouch for the transport of the\r\nyoung. The lower jaw of one of these earliest known examples of the\r\nmammalian class, found in the Stonesfield slate, near Oxford, may be\r\nseen at the British Museum, to which it was presented by J. W. Broderip,\r\nEsq., F.R.S., by whom it was described in the “Zoological Journal,” vol.\r\niii., p. 408.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that the marsupial genera, to which the\r\nabove fossil quadruped, called _Phascolotherium_, was most nearly\r\nallied, are now confined to New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land;\r\nsince it is in the Australian seas that is found the _Cestracion_, a\r\ncartilaginous fish which has teeth that are most like those fossil teeth\r\ncalled _Acrodus_ and _Psammodus_, so common in the oolite. In the same\r\nAustralian seas, also, near the shore, the beautiful shell-fish called\r\n_Trigonia_ is found living, of which genus many fossil species occur in\r\nthe Stonesfield slate. Moreover, the Araucarian pines are now abundant,\r\ntogether with ferns, in Australia, as they were in Europe in the oolitic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIAS.\r\n\r\n“Lias” is an English provincial name adopted in geology, and applied to\r\na formation of limestone, marl, and petrified clay, which forms the base\r\nof the oolite, or immediately underlies that division of secondary\r\nrocks. The lias has been traced throughout a great part of Europe,\r\nforming beds of a thickness varying from 500 to 1000 feet of the\r\nabove-mentioned substances, which have been gradually deposited from a\r\nsea of corresponding extent and direction. The lias abounds with marine\r\nshells of extinct species, and with remains of fishes that were clad\r\nwith large and hard shining scales. Of the higher or air-breathing\r\nanimals of that period, the most characteristic were the\r\n\r\n\r\nENALIOSAURIA.\r\n\r\nThe creatures called Enaliosauria or Sea-lizards (from the Greek\r\n_enalios_, of the sea, and _sauros_, lizard), were vertebrate animals,\r\nor had back bones, breathed the air like land quadrupeds, but were\r\ncold-blooded, or of a low temperature, like crocodiles and other\r\nreptiles. The proof that the Enaliosaurs respired atmospheric air\r\nimmediately, and did not breathe water by means of gills like fishes, is\r\nafforded by the absence of the bony framework of the gill apparatus, and\r\nby the presence, position, and structure of the air passages leading\r\nfrom the nostrils, and also by the bony mechanism of the capacious chest\r\nor thoracic-abdominal cavity: all of which characters have been\r\ndemonstrated by their fossil skeletons. With these characters the\r\nSea-lizards combined the presence of two pairs of limbs shaped like\r\nfins, and adapted for swimming.\r\n\r\nThe Enaliosauria offer two principal modifications of their anatomical,\r\nand especially their bony, structure, of which the two kinds grouped\r\ntogether under the respective names of Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus\r\nare the examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ICHTHYOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThe genus Ichthyosaurus includes many species: of which three of the\r\nbest known and most remarkable have been selected for restoration to\r\nillustrate this most singular of the extinct forms of animal life.\r\n\r\nThe name (from the Greek _ichthys_, a fish, and _sauros_, a lizard)\r\nindicates the closer affinity of the Ichthyosaur, as compared with the\r\nPlesiosaur, to the class of fishes. The Ichthyosaurs are remarkable for\r\nthe shortness of the neck and the equality of the width of the back of\r\nthe head with the front of the chest, impressing the observer of the\r\nfossil skeleton with a conviction that the ancient animal must have\r\nresembled the whale tribe and the fishes in the absence of any\r\nintervening constriction or “neck.”\r\n\r\nThis close approximation in the Ichthyosaurs to the form of the most\r\nstrictly aquatic back-boned (vertebrate) animals of the existing\r\ncreation is accompanied by an important modification of the surfaces\r\nforming the joints of the back-bone, each of which surfaces is hollow,\r\nleading to the inference that they were originally connected together by\r\nan elastic bag, or “capsule,” filled with fluid--a structure which\r\nprevails in the class of fishes, but not in any of the whale or porpoise\r\ntribe, nor in any, save a few of the very lowest and most fish-like, of\r\nthe existing reptiles.\r\n\r\nWith the above modifications of the head, trunk, and limbs, in relation\r\nto swimming, there co-exist corresponding modifications of the tail. The\r\nbones of this part are much more numerous than in the Plesiosaurs, and\r\nthe entire tail is consequently longer; but it does not show any of\r\nthose modifications that characterise the bony support of the tail in\r\nfishes. The numerous “caudal vertebræ” of the Ichthyosaurus gradually\r\ndecrease in size to the end of the tail, where they assume a compressed\r\nform, or are flattened from side to side, and thus the tail instead of\r\nbeing short and broad, as in fishes, is lengthened out as in crocodiles.\r\n\r\nThe very frequent occurrence of a fracture of the tail, about one fourth\r\nof the way from its extremity, in well-preserved and entire fossil\r\nskeletons, is owing to that proportion of the end of the tail having\r\nsupported a tail-fin. The only evidence which the fossil skeleton of a\r\nwhale would yield of the powerful horizontal tail-fin characteristic of\r\nthe living animal, is the depressed or horizontally flattened form of\r\nthe bones supporting such fin. It is inferred, therefore, from the\r\ncorresponding bones of the Ichthyosaurus being flattened from side to\r\nside, that it possessed a tegumentary tail-fin expanded in the vertical\r\ndirection. The shape of a fin composed of such perishable material is of\r\ncourse conjectural, but from analogies, not necessary here to further\r\nenlarge upon, it was probably like, or nearly like, that which the able\r\nartist engaged in the restoration of the entire form of the animal has\r\ngiven to it. Thus, in the construction of the principal swimming-organ\r\nof the Ichthyosaurus we may trace, as in other parts of its structure, a\r\ncombination of mammalian (beast-like), saurian (lizard-like), and\r\npiscine (fish-like) peculiarities. In its great length and gradual\r\ndiminution we perceive its saurian character; the tegumentary nature of\r\nthe fin, unsustained by bony fin-rays, bespeaks its affinity to the same\r\npart in the mammalian whales and porpoises; whilst its vertical position\r\nmakes it closely resemble the tail-fin of the fish.\r\n\r\nThe horizontality of the tail-fin of the whale tribe is essentially\r\nconnected with their necessities as warm-blooded animals breathing\r\natmospheric air; without this means of displacing a mass of water in the\r\nvertical direction, the head of the whale could not be brought with the\r\nrequired rapidity to the surface to respire; but the Ichthyosaurs, not\r\nbeing warm-blooded, or quick breathers, would not need to bring their\r\nhead to the surface so frequently, or so rapidly, as the whale; and,\r\nmoreover, a compensation for the want of horizontality of their tail-fin\r\nwas provided by the addition of a pair of hind-paddles, which are not\r\npresent in the whale tribe. The vertical fin was a more efficient organ\r\nin the rapid cleaving of the liquid element, when the Ichthyosaurs were\r\nin pursuit of their prey, or escaping from an enemy.\r\n\r\nThat the Ichthyosaurs occasionally sought the shores, crawled on the\r\nstrand, and basked in the sunshine, may be inferred from the bony\r\nstructure connected with their fore-fins, which does not exist in any\r\nporpoise, dolphin, grampus, or whale; and for want of which, chiefly,\r\nthose warm-blooded, air-breathing, marine animals are so helpless when\r\nleft high and dry on the sands: the structure in question in the\r\nIchthyosaur is a strong osseous arch, inverted and spanning across\r\nbeneath the chest from one shoulder-joint to the other; and what is most\r\nremarkable in the structure of this “scapular” arch, as it is called,\r\nis, that it closely resembles, in the number, shape, and disposition of\r\nits bones, the same part in the singular aquatic mammalian quadruped of\r\nAustralia, called _Ornithorhynchus_, _Platypus_, and Duck-mole. The\r\nIchthyosaurs, when so visiting the shore, either for sleep, or\r\nprocreation, would lie, or crawl prostrate, or with the belly resting or\r\ndragging on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary feature of the head was the enormous magnitude of\r\nthe eye; and from the quantity of light admitted by the expanded pupil\r\nit must have possessed great powers of vision, especially in the dusk.\r\nIt is not uncommon to find in front of the orbit (cavity for the eye),\r\nin fossil skulls, a circular series of petrified thin bony plates,\r\nranged round a central aperture, where the pupil of the eye was placed.\r\nThe eyes of many fishes are defended by a bony covering consisting of\r\ntwo pieces; but a compound circle of overlapping plates is now found\r\nonly in the eyes of turtles, tortoises, lizards, and birds. This curious\r\napparatus of bony plates would aid in protecting the eyeball from the\r\nwaves of the sea when the Ichthyosaurus rose to the surface, and from\r\nthe pressure of the dense element when it dived to great depths; and\r\nthey show, writes Dr. Buckland,[46] “that the enormous eye, of which\r\nthey formed the front, was an optical instrument of varied and\r\nprodigious power, enabling the Ichthyosaurus to descry its prey at great\r\nor little distances, in the obscurity of night, and in the depths of the\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\n  [46] Op. cit., p. 174.\r\n\r\nOf no extinct reptile are the materials for a complete and exact\r\nrestoration more abundant and satisfactory than of the Ichthyosaurus\r\nthey plainly show that its general external figure must have been that\r\nof a huge predatory abdominal fish, with a longer tail, and a smaller\r\ntail-fin: scale-less, moreover, and covered by a smooth, or finely\r\nwrinkled skin analogous to that of the whale tribe.\r\n\r\nThe mouth was wide, and the jaws long, and armed with numerous pointed\r\nteeth, indicative of a predatory and carnivorous nature in all the\r\nspecies; but these differed from one another in regard to the relative\r\nstrength of the jaws, and the relative size and length of the teeth.\r\n\r\nMasses of masticated bones and scales of extinct fishes, that lived in\r\nthe same seas and at the same period as the Ichthyosaurus, have been\r\nfound under the ribs of fossil specimens, in the situation where the\r\nstomach of the animal was placed; smaller, harder, and more digested\r\nmasses, containing also fish-bones and scales have been found, bearing\r\nthe impression of the structure of the internal surface of the intestine\r\nof the great predatory sea-lizard. These digested masses are called\r\n“coprolites.”\r\n\r\nIn tracing the evidences of creative power from the earlier to the later\r\nformations of the earth’s crust, remains of the Ichthyosaurus are first\r\nfound in the lower lias, and occur, more or less abundantly, through all\r\nthe superincumbent secondary strata up to, and inclusive of, the chalk\r\nformations. They are most numerous in the lias and oolite, and the\r\nlargest and most characteristic species have been found in these\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 12.--ICHTHYOSAURUS PLATYODON.\r\n\r\nThis most gigantic species, so called on account of the crown of the\r\ntooth being more flattened than in other species, and having sharp\r\nedges, as well as a sharp point, was first discovered in the has of Lyme\r\nRegis, in Dorsetshire. Fossil remains now in the British Museum, and in\r\nthe museum of the Geological Society, fully bear out the dimensions\r\nexhibited by the restoration of the animal as seen basking on the shore\r\nbetween the two specimens of Long-necked Plesiosaurs. The head of this\r\nspecies is relatively larger in proportion to the trunk, than in the\r\n_Ichthyosaurus communis_ or _Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris_: the lower jaw\r\nis remarkably massive and powerful, and projects backwards beyond the\r\njoint, as far as it does in the crocodile. In the skull of an individual\r\nof this species, preserved in the apartments of the Geological Society\r\nof London, the cavity for the eye, or orbit, measures, in its long\r\ndiameter, fourteen inches. The fore and hind paddles are large and of\r\nequal size.\r\n\r\nThe lias of the valley of Lyme Regis, Dorsetshire, is the chief\r\ngrave-yard of the _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_; but its remains are pretty\r\nwidely distributed. They have been found in the lias of Glastonbury, of\r\nBristol, of Scarborough and Whitby, and of Bitton, in Gloucestershire;\r\nsome vertebræ, apparently of this species, have likewise been found in\r\nthe lias at Ohmden, in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 13.--ICHTHYOSAURUS TENUIROSTRIS.\r\n\r\nBehind the _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_, is placed the restoration of the\r\n_Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris_, or Slender-snouted Fish-lizard. The most\r\nstriking peculiarity of this species is the great length and slenderness\r\nof the jaw-bones, which, in combination with the large eye-sockets and\r\nflattened cranium, give to the entire skull a form which resembles that\r\nof a gigantic snipe or woodcock, with the bill armed with teeth. These\r\nweapons, in the present species, are relatively more numerous, smaller,\r\nand more sharply pointed than in the foregoing, and indicate that the\r\n_Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris_ preyed on a smaller kind of fish. The\r\nfore-paddles are larger than the hind ones. In the museum of the\r\nPhilosophical Institution, at Bristol, there is an almost entire\r\nskeleton of the present species which measures thirteen feet in length.\r\nIt was discovered in the lias of Lyme Regis. Portions of jaws and other\r\nparts of the skeletons of larger individuals have been found fossil in\r\nthe lias near Bristol, at Barrow-on-Soar, in Leicestershire, and at\r\nStratford-on-Avon. The _Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris_ has also left its\r\nremains in the lias formation at Boll and Amburg, in Wirtemberg,\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 14.--ICHTHYOSAURUS COMMUNIS.\r\n\r\nOf this species, which was the most “common,” when first discovered in\r\n1824, but which has since been surpassed by other species in regard to\r\nthe known number of individuals, the head is restored, as protruded from\r\nthe water, to the right of the foregoing species.\r\n\r\nThe _Ichthyosaurus communis_ is characterised by its relatively large\r\nteeth, with expanded, deeply-grooved bases, and round conical furrowed\r\ncrowns; the upper jaw contains, on each side, from forty to fifty of\r\nsuch teeth. The fore-paddles are three times larger than the hind ones.\r\nWith respect to the size which it attained, the _Ichthyosaurus communis_\r\nseems only to be second to the _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_. In the museum\r\nof the Earl of Enniskillen, there is a fossil skull of the\r\n_Ichthyosaurus communis_ which, measures, in length, two feet nine\r\ninches, indicating an animal of at least twenty feet in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLESIOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this genus forms one of the most important additions\r\nthat geology has made to comparative anatomy. Baron Cuvier deemed “its\r\nstructure to have been the most singular, and its characters the most\r\nmonstrous, that had been yet discovered amid the ruins of a former\r\nworld.” To the head of a lizard it united the teeth of a crocodile, a\r\nneck of enormous length, resembling the body of a serpent, a trunk and\r\ntail having the proportions of an ordinary quadruped, the ribs of a\r\nchameleon, and the paddles of a whale. “Such,” writes Dr. Buckland, “are\r\nthe strange combinations of form and structure in the Plesiosaurus, a\r\ngenus, the remains of which, after interment for thousands of years\r\namidst the wreck of millions of extinct inhabitants of the ancient\r\nearth, are at length recalled to light by the researches of the\r\ngeologist, and submitted to our examination, in nearly as perfect a\r\nstate as the bones of species that are now existing upon the earth.”\r\n(Op. cit., vol. v. p. 203).\r\n\r\nThe first remains of this animal were discovered in the lias of Lyme\r\nRegis, about the year 1823, and formed the subject of the paper by the\r\nRev. Mr. Conybeare (now Dean of Llandaff), and Mr. (now Sir Henry) De la\r\nBeche, in which the genus was established and named Plesiosaurus (from\r\nthe Greek words, _plesios_ and _sauros_, signifying “near” or “allied\r\nto,” and “lizard”), because the authors saw that it was more nearly\r\nallied to the lizard than was the Ichthyosaurus from the same formation.\r\n\r\nThe entire and undisturbed skeletons of several individuals, of\r\ndifferent species, have since been discovered, fully confirming the\r\nsagacious restorations by the original discoverers of the\r\n_Plesiosaurus_. Of these species three have been selected as the\r\nsubjects of Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins’s reconstructions and representations\r\nof the living form of the strange reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 15.--PLESIOSAURUS MACROCEPHALUS.\r\n\r\nThe first of these has been called, from the relatively larger size of\r\nthe head, the _Plesiosaurus macrocephalus_ (No. 15), (Gr. _macros_,\r\nlong, _cephale_, head). The entire length of the animal, as indicated by\r\nthe largest remains, and as given in the restoration, is eighteen feet,\r\nthe length of the head being two feet, that of the neck six feet; the\r\ngreatest girth of the body yields seven feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 15. Plesiosaurus macrocephalus.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Baron Cuvier and Dr. Buckland both rightly allude to the\r\nresemblance of the fins or paddles of the Plesiosaur to those of the\r\nwhale, yet this most remarkable difference must be borne in mind, that,\r\nwhereas the whale tribe have never more than one pair of fins, the\r\nPlesiosaurs have always two pairs, answering to the fore and hind limbs\r\nof land quadrupeds; and the fore-pair of fins, corresponding to those in\r\nthe whale, differed by being more firmly articulated, through the medium\r\nof collar-bones (clavicles), and of two other very broad and strong\r\nbones (called coracoids), to the trunk (thorax), whereby they were the\r\nbetter enabled to move the animal upon dry land.\r\n\r\nRemains of the _Plesiosaurus macrocephalus_ have been discovered in the\r\nlias of Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, and of Weston, in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 16.--PLESIOSAURUS DOLICHODEIRUS.\r\n\r\nFurther to the left, on the shore of the Secondary Island, is a\r\nrestoration of the _Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus_, or Long-necked\r\nPlesiosaurus (No. 16). The head in this remarkable species is smaller,\r\nand the neck proportionally longer than in the _Plesiosaurus\r\nmacrocephalus_. The remains of the Long-necked Plesiosaur have been\r\nfound chiefly at Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire. The well known specimen of\r\nan almost entire skeleton, formerly in the possession of His Grace the\r\nDuke of Buckingham, is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 17.--PLESIOSAURUS HAWKINSII.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect skeletons of the Plesiosaurus are those that have been\r\nwrought out of the lias at Street, near Glastonbury, by Mr. Thomas\r\nHawkins, F.G.S., and which have been purchased by the trustees of the\r\nBritish Museum. A restoration is given by Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins, at No.\r\n17, of a species with characters somewhat intermediate between the\r\nLarge-headed and Long-necked Plesiosaurs, and which has been called,\r\nafter its discoverer, _Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii_.\r\n\r\nThe Plesiosaurs breathed air like the existing crocodiles and the whale\r\ntribe, and appear to have lived in shallow seas and estuaries. That the\r\nLong-necked Sea-lizard was aquatic is evident from the form of its\r\npaddles; and that it was marine is almost equally so, from the remains\r\nwith which its fossils are universally associated; that it may have\r\noccasionally visited the shore, the resemblance of its extremities to\r\nthose of a turtle leads us to conjecture; its motion, however, must have\r\nbeen very awkward on land; its long neck must have impeded its progress\r\nthrough the water, presenting a striking contrast to the organisation\r\nwhich so admirably adapted the Ichthyosaurus to cut its swift course\r\nthrough the waves. “May it not, therefore, be concluded that it swam\r\nupon, or near the surface,” asks its accomplished discoverer, “arching\r\nback its long neck like a swan, and occasionally darting it down at the\r\nfish that happened to float within its reach? It may perhaps have lurked\r\nin shoal-water along the coast, concealed among the sea-weed, and,\r\nraising its nostrils to a level with the surface from a considerable\r\ndepth, may have found a secure retreat from the assaults of dangerous\r\nenemies; while the length and flexibility of its neck may have\r\ncompensated for the want of strength in its jaws, and its incapacity for\r\nswift motion through the water, by the suddenness and agility of the\r\nattack which it enabled it to make on every animal fitted for its prey\r\nwhich came within its reach.”[47]\r\n\r\n  [47] “Transactions of the Geological Society,” Second Series, vi. 503.\r\n  1841.\r\n\r\nFor the Secondary Island three species of the Plesiosaurus have been\r\nrestored, the _Plesiosaurus macrocephalus_, the _Plesiosaurus\r\ndolichodeirus_ (Gr. _dolichos_, long, _deire_, neck), and the\r\n_Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii_. The name “long-necked” was given to the second\r\nof these species before it was known that many other species with long\r\nand slender necks had existed in the seas of the same ancient period:\r\nthe third species is named after Mr. Thomas Hawkins, F.G.S., the\r\ngentleman by whose patience, zeal, and skill, the British Museum has\r\nbeen enriched with so many entire skeletons of these most extraordinary\r\nextinct sea-lizards.\r\n\r\nThe remains of all these species occur in the lias at Lyme Regis, and at\r\nStreet, near Glastonbury; but the _Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii_ is the most\r\nabundant in the latter locality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW RED SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\n“Trias” is an arbitrary term applied in geology to the upper division of\r\na vast series of red loams, shales, and sandstones, interposed between\r\nthe lias and the coal, in the midland and western counties of England.\r\nThis series is collectively called the “New Red Sandstone formation,” to\r\ndistinguish it from the “Old Red Sandstone formation,” of similar or\r\nidentical mineral character, which lies immediately beneath the coal.\r\n\r\nThe animals which have been restored and placed on the lowest formation\r\nof the Secondary Island, are peculiar to the “triassic,” or upper\r\ndivision of the “New Red Sandstone” series, which division consists, in\r\nEngland, of saliferous (salt-including) shales and sandstones, from 1000\r\nto 1500 feet thick in Lancashire and Cheshire, answering to the\r\nformation called “Keuper-sandstone” by the German geologists; and of\r\nsandstone and quartzose conglomerate of 600 feet in thickness, answering\r\nto the German “Bunter-sandstone.”\r\n\r\nThe largest and most characteristic animals of the trias are reptiles of\r\nthe order\r\n\r\n\r\nBATRACHIA.\r\n\r\nThe name of this order is from the Greek word _batrachos_, signifying a\r\nfrog: and the order is represented in the present animal-population of\r\nEngland by a few diminutive species of frogs, toads, and newts, or\r\nwater-salamanders. But, at the period of the deposition of the new red\r\nsandstone, in the present counties of Warwick and Cheshire, the shores\r\nof the ancient sea, which were then formed by that sandy deposit, were\r\ntrodden by reptiles, having the essential bony characters of the\r\nBatrachia, but combining these with other bony characters of crocodiles\r\nand lizards; and exhibiting both under a bulk which is made manifest by\r\nthe restoration of the largest known species, (No. 16), occupying the\r\nextreme promontory of the Island, illustrative of the lowest and oldest\r\ndeposits of the secondary series of rocks. The species in question is\r\ncalled the--\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 18.--LABYRINTHODON SALAMANDROIDES,\r\n\r\nor the Salamander-like Labyrinthodon; the latter term being from the\r\nGreek, signifying the peculiar structure of the teeth, which differ from\r\nall other reptiles in the huge Batrachia in question, by reason of the\r\ncomplex labyrinthic interblending of the different substances composing\r\nthe teeth. The skull of the Labyrinthodon is attached to the neck-bones\r\nby two joints or condyles, and the teeth are situated both on the proper\r\njaw-bones, and on the bone of the roof of the mouth called “vomer:” both\r\nthese characters are only found at the present day in the frogs and\r\nsalamanders. The hind-foot of the Labyrinthodon was also, as in the toad\r\nand frog, much larger than the fore-foot; and the innermost digit in\r\nboth was short and turned in, like a thumb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 18. Labyrinthodon Salamandroides.]\r\n\r\nConsecutive impressions of the prints of these feet have been traced for\r\nmany steps in succession (as is accurately represented in the new red\r\nsandstone part of the Secondary Island) in quarries of that formation in\r\nWarwickshire, Cheshire, and also in Lancashire, more especially at a\r\nquarry of a whitish quartzose sandstone at Storton Hill, a few miles\r\nfrom Liverpool. The foot-marks are partly concave and partly in relief;\r\nthe former are seen upon the upper surface of the sandstone slabs, but\r\nthose in relief are only upon the lower surfaces, being, in fact,\r\nnatural casts, formed on the subjacent foot-prints as in moulds. The\r\nimpressions of the hind-foot are generally eight inches in length and\r\nfive inches in width: near each large footstep, and at a regular\r\ndistance--about an inch and a half--before it, a smaller print of the\r\nfore-foot, four inches long and three inches wide, occurs. The footsteps\r\nfollow each other in pairs, each pair in the same line, at intervals of\r\nabout fourteen inches from pair to pair. The large as well as the small\r\nsteps show the thumb-like toe alternately on the right and left side,\r\neach step making a print of five toes.\r\n\r\nFoot-prints of corresponding form but of smaller size have been\r\ndiscovered in the quarry at Storton Hill, imprinted on five thin beds of\r\nclay, lying one upon another in the same quarry, and separated by beds\r\nof sandstone. From the lower surface of the sandstone layers, the solid\r\ncasts of each impression project in high relief, and afford models of\r\nthe feet, toes, and claws of the animals which trod on the clay.\r\n\r\nSimilar foot-prints were first observed in Saxony, at the village of\r\nHessberg, near Hillburghausen, in several quarries of a gray quartzose\r\nsandstone, alternating with beds of red sandstone, and of the same\r\ngeological age as the sandstones of England that had been trodden by the\r\nsame strange animal. The German geologist, who first described them,\r\nproposed the name of _Cheirotherium_ (Gr. _cheir_, the hand, _therion_,\r\nbeast), for the great unknown animal that had left the foot-prints, in\r\nconsequence of the resemblance, both of the fore and hind feet, to the\r\nimpression of a human hand, and Dr. Kaup conjectured that the animal\r\nmight be a large species of the opossum-kind. The discovery, however, of\r\nfossil skulls, jaws, teeth, and a few other bones in the sandstones\r\nexhibiting the footprints in question, has rendered it more probable\r\nthat both the footprints and the fossils are evidences of the same kind\r\nof huge extinct Batrachian reptiles.\r\n\r\nAn entire skull of the largest species discovered in the new red\r\nsandstones of Wurtemberg; a lower jaw of the same species found in the\r\nsame formation in Warwickshire; some vertebræ, and a few fragments of\r\nbones of the limbs, have served, with the indications of size and shape\r\nof the trunk of the animal yielded by the series of consecutive\r\nfoot-prints, as the basis of the restoration of the _Labyrinthodon\r\nsalamandroides_, in the Secondary Island. It is to be understood,\r\nhowever, that, with the exception of the head, the form of the animal is\r\nnecessarily more or less conjectural.\r\n\r\n\r\nNos. 19 & 20.--LABYBINTHODON PACHYGNATHUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nos. 19 & 20. Section of Tooth of Labyrinthodon.\r\n\r\n_a_ Pulp-cavity: _b b_ inflected folds of ossified capsule of tooth.]\r\n\r\nThis name, signifying the Thick-jawed Labyrinthodon, was given by its\r\ndiscoverer to a species of these singular Batrachia, found in the new\r\nred sandstone of Warwickshire, and which bears to the largest species\r\nthe proportion exhibited by the head and fore-part of the body, as\r\nemerging from the water, for which parts alone the fossils hitherto\r\ndiscovered justify the restoration.[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] Conybeare, Geol. Trans., i. 388.\r\n\r\n\r\nNos. 21 & 22.--DICYNODON.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Mr. Andrew G. Bain, who had been employed in the construction of\r\nmilitary roads in the colony of the Cape of Good Hope, discovered, in\r\nthe tract of country extending northwards from the county of Albany,\r\nabout 450 miles east of Cape Town, several nodules or lumps of a kind of\r\nsandstone, which, when broken, displayed, in most instances, evidences\r\nof fossil bones, and usually of a skull with two large projecting teeth.\r\nAccordingly, these evidences of ancient animal life in South Africa were\r\nfirst notified to English geologists by Mr. Bain under the name of\r\n“Bidentals;” and the specimens transmitted by him were submitted at his\r\nrequest to Professor Owen for examination. The results of the\r\ncomparisons thereupon instituted went to show that there had formerly\r\nexisted in South Africa, and from geological evidence, probably, in a\r\ngreat salt-water lake or inland sea, since converted into dry land, a\r\nrace of reptilian animals presenting in the construction of their skull\r\ncharacters of the crocodile, the tortoise, and the lizard, coupled with\r\nthe presence of a pair of huge sharp-pointed tusks, growing downwards,\r\none from each side of the upper jaw, like the tusks of the mammalian\r\nmorse or walrus. No other kind of teeth were developed in these singular\r\nanimals: the lower jaw was armed, as in the tortoise, by a trenchant\r\nsheath of horn. Some bones of the back, or vertebræ, by the hollowness\r\nof the co-adapted articular surfaces, indicate these reptiles to have\r\nbeen good swimmers, and probably to have habitually existed in water;\r\nbut the construction of the bony passages of the nostrils proves that\r\nthey must have come to the surface to breathe air.\r\n\r\nSome extinct plants allied to the Lepidodendron, with other fossils,\r\nrender it probable that the sandstones containing the Dicynodont\r\nreptiles were of the same geological age as those that have revealed the\r\nremains of the Labyrinthodonts in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe generic name Dicynodon is from the Greek words signifying “two tusks\r\nor canine teeth.” Three species of this genus have been demonstrated\r\nfrom the fossils transmitted by Mr. Bain.\r\n\r\nThe _Dicynodon lacerticeps_, or Lizard-headed Dicynodon, attained the\r\nbulk of a walrus; the form of the head and tusks is correctly given in\r\nthe restoration (No. 21); the trunk has been added conjecturally, to\r\nillustrate the strange combination of characters manifested in the head.\r\n\r\nA second species, with a head so formed as to have given the animal\r\nsomewhat of the physiognomy of an owl, has been partially restored at\r\nNo. 22.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 8.

With much\r\ngratification I avail myself of the privilege granted to an author, in\r\nhis preface, of returning my best thanks to those friends who have lent\r\nme their aid in this arduous undertaking. Mr. Digby Wyatt is entitled to\r\nthe gratitude of all engaged in the works of art at the Crystal Palace\r\nfor the opportunities he has afforded to each artist for the display of\r\nhis particular talents, and I sincerely thank him for his kindness in\r\naccompanying me through the building and affording minute information to\r\nmy numerous enquiries when he could with difficulty spare the time. I\r\nbeg also cordially to thank Mr. Samuel Phillips for important\r\nsuggestions respecting the conduct of my work, and for his interest and\r\nencouragement in its progress. Mr. Edward Falkener is entitled to my\r\nbest acknowledgments, not only for the valuable assistance rendered in\r\nhis published account of a Pompeian house, but for his kindness in\r\nlooking over the proofs of these pages before they were committed to\r\npress. It is to be hoped that many of his observations may appear at\r\ngreater length in the next edition of this Handbook, without prejudice\r\nto the magnificent work he is contemplating on the “Domestic\r\nArchitecture of Pompeii.” I sincerely thank my friend, Mr. James Morant\r\nLockyer for the benefit of his long architectural sojourn in Pompeii;\r\nregretting, at the same time, that the public has not had the advantage\r\nof his extensive knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nThe excellent paintings produced here in the Pompeian Court, under the\r\ndirection of Signor Abbate require no commendation from me; but I feel\r\nthat I shall be only expressing the sentiment of others in wishing that\r\nwe may at some future period see an extension of this ancient palace, or\r\nanother series of apartments in which the same abilities shall afford us\r\naccurate copies of still more of the pictorial celebrities--such as the\r\nTheseus and the Minotaur, and Hercules and Telephus, found at\r\nHerculaneum; the Sacrifice of Iphigenia and the Anger of Achilles, from\r\nthe House of the Tragic Poet; also the Zephyrus and Flora, and some of\r\nthe picture mosaics, the Choragus one, for instance, and the far-famed\r\nAlexander and Darius at the battle of Issus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POMPEIAN COURT.\r\n\r\nDESCRIBED BY GEORGE SCHARF, JUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII.\r\n\r\n“Many a calamity has befallen the world ere now, yet none like this\r\nreplete with instruction and delight for remote generations.”--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Naples and Mount Vesuvius.]\r\n\r\nNear the modern city of Naples, at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, once\r\nstood the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Whilst the former\r\nwas considerably removed from the volcano, the latter was seated\r\nimmediately at the base of the mountain, on a promontory projecting into\r\nthe bay.\r\n\r\nVesuvius was not considered dangerous by the ancient occupants of the\r\nsoil, as no eruption had ever been known to take place. Strabo noticed\r\nthe igneous character of its rocks, but the whole district being covered\r\nwith vines and plantations, undisturbed since the memory of man, he\r\nthence assumed the fires to be extinct for want of fuel. Even the sides\r\nof the mountain were overgrown with trees, and the summit alone\r\ncontinued barren and rough. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood were\r\nprobably less inclined to consider the possibility of danger to\r\nthemselves from the existence of two active volcanoes not far from them\r\nwhich seemed to serve as a vent for all subterranean commotions--the\r\none, Mount Ætna; the other, Mount Epopeus in the island now called\r\nIschia. Ætna, the majestic snowy mountain of Sicily, more than three\r\ntimes the height of Vesuvius, has been known, from the earliest times,\r\nas an active volcano; and many passages in Æschylus, Pindar, Thucydides,\r\nand Diodorus Siculus might be adduced, commemorating particular\r\neruptions, &c. Pausanias mentions an instance of the piety of two youths\r\nwho saved their parents at Catana (Book 10., ch. xxviii.) during the\r\ndescent of the lava which threatened to surround them. In the year 73\r\nB.C., Spartacus, a fugitive slave, at the head of a troop of gladiators\r\nand revolters, encamped on the summit of Vesuvius, where they were\r\nblockaded. The natural ruggedness of the place, and the density of the\r\nvines, favoured their subsequent escape. This is the earliest mention of\r\nthe actual appearance of the volcano. The natural beauties of the\r\ndistrict, then called Campania, are glorified by most writers; it was\r\nmore particularly celebrated for its fertility and the luxuriant\r\nmagnificence of its scenery.\r\n\r\nThe convulsions of nature have indeed changed the outline of the\r\nmountain, but the varied charms of the beautiful coast remain in\r\nundiminished attraction. Deep shades and crystal streamlets, sunny banks\r\nand refreshing groves, display the natural loveliness of a locality,\r\nfavoured with the most luxuriant vegetation, and the finest climate in\r\nthe world. These enable us fully to comprehend the pains and trouble\r\nbestowed by the ancient Romans in building villas and marine residences\r\nin so charming a situation. Thus, in the earliest times of the empire,\r\nthe more wealthy and luxurious Romans established what we moderns should\r\ndenominate watering places, for fashionable resort, on the coast, Baiæ,\r\nDicæarchia, afterwards Puteoli, Cumæ, Neapolis, and Herculaneum, but the\r\nwarm springs of the first two rendered them the most favourite resorts,\r\nand they became the Bath and Brighton of that era.\r\n\r\nLucullus, Pompey and Cæsar, had villas at Baiæ, Nero spent much time\r\nthere, and Caligula contributed to the celebrity of the scene by his\r\nextraordinary bridge of boats. Hadrian died at Baiæ; and, at a later\r\nperiod, Alexander Severus erected many villas in the same neighbourhood.\r\nSome of the most splendid palaces were raised upon artificial\r\nfoundations in the sea itself, and nothing could exceed the luxury and\r\nindolence indulged in by the visitors to these regions as depicted by\r\nsome of the later poets. Horace himself speaks of the pleasant Baiæ as\r\nthe most delicious place in the world.[49] And so it may have been, and\r\nall the neighbouring cities of the bay must have partaken more or less\r\nof the same glories. Pompeii was somewhat removed from these enchanting\r\nscenes, being on the other side of the bay of Naples, and the situation\r\nwas not so pleasant as that of its fellow-sufferer Herculaneum. This\r\ncity stood on a promontory, open, as Strabo says, to the south wind,\r\nwhich made it especially healthy. In fact, the art and style of\r\neverything found at Herculaneum show it to have been the resort of a\r\nsuperior class of people. Pompeii is supposed to have stood on the banks\r\nof the river Sarnus. The town itself was raised upon a considerable\r\neminence so as to be protected in a great measure from the floods that\r\nat certain times of the year devastated the surrounding plain.\r\n\r\n  [49] “Nullus in orbe sinus Baiis prælucet amœnis.”--Ep. bk. i. 1, line\r\n  83.\r\n\r\nThe peace and tranquillity of these beautiful regions were first\r\ndisturbed by natural convulsions in the year 63 A.D. A violent\r\nearthquake on the 16th February, threw down many parts of Pompeii, and\r\nseriously injured Herculaneum; six hundred sheep were swallowed up at\r\nonce, statues were split, and many persons became insane. From this\r\nperiod, the Pompeians were disturbed by frequent shocks of earthquake;\r\nbetween the first symptoms in 63 and the dreadful catastrophe which\r\ninvolved their destruction, evidences still exist of the persevering\r\nendeavours of the inhabitants at restoration and repair. Many mosaics\r\nhave been found, which display traces of a very different order of\r\nworkmanship, in, the repair of damage caused by the earthquake, from\r\nthat employed in their original construction.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the emperor Titus, A.D. 79, the celebrated eruption of\r\nVesuvius broke out, suddenly ejecting dense clouds of ashes and\r\npumice-stones, beneath which Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Stabiæ were\r\ncompletely buried. Awful as such a phenomenon must at all times appear,\r\nthe event was still more appalling to the inhabitants as they were\r\nunable, in the confusion of the moment, to comprehend the source whence\r\nthese horrors proceeded. An eye witness has fortunately left a detailed\r\naccount of the event in two letters which are still preserved. We insert\r\nthe greater part of them as best exhibiting the realities of the scene\r\nand the excitement of the unfortunate sufferers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLINY’S LETTER TO TACITUS.\r\n\r\n“Your request that I would send you an account of my uncle’s death, in\r\norder to transmit a more exact relation of it to posterity, deserves my\r\nacknowledgments; for if this action shall be celebrated by your pen, the\r\nglory of it, I am well assured, will be rendered for ever illustrious.\r\nAnd notwithstanding he perished by a misfortune, which, as it involved\r\nat the same time a most beautiful country in ruins, and destroyed so\r\nmany populous cities, seems to promise him an everlasting remembrance;\r\nnotwithstanding he has himself composed many and lasting works, yet I am\r\npersuaded the mentioning of him in your immortal writings will greatly\r\ncontribute to eternise his name. Happy I esteem those to be whom\r\nProvidence has distinguished with the abilities either of doing such\r\nactions as are worthy of being related, or of relating them in a manner\r\nworthy of being read; but doubly happy are they who are blessed with\r\nboth these uncommon talents. In the number of which my uncle, as his own\r\nwritings and your history will evidently prove, may justly be ranked. It\r\nis with extreme willingness, therefore, I execute your commands; and\r\nshould indeed have claimed the task if you had not enjoined it.\r\n\r\n“He was at that time with the fleet under his command at Misenum. On the\r\n24th of August, about one in the afternoon, my mother desired him to\r\nobserve a cloud which appeared of a very unusual size and shape. He had\r\njust returned from taking the benefit of the sun, and after bathing\r\nhimself in cold water, and taking a slight repast, was retired to his\r\nstudy. He immediately arose and went out up on an eminence from whence\r\nhe might more distinctly view this uncommon appearance. It was not at\r\nthat distance discernible from what mountain this cloud issued, but it\r\nwas found afterwards to ascend from Mount Vesuvius. I cannot give you a\r\nmore exact description of its figure, than by resembling it to that of a\r\npine tree, for it shot up a great height in the form of a trunk, which\r\nextended itself at the top into sort of branches, occasioned, I imagine,\r\neither by a sudden gust of air that impelled it, the force of which\r\ndecreased as it advanced upwards, or the cloud itself being pressed back\r\nagain by its own weight, expanded in this manner:--it appeared sometimes\r\nbright and sometimes dark and spotted, as it was either more or less\r\nimpregnated with earth and cinder. This extraordinary phenomenon excited\r\nmy uncle’s philosophical curiosity to take a nearer view of it. He\r\nordered a light vessel to be got ready, and gave me the liberty, if I\r\nthought it proper, to attend him; I rather chose to continue my studies;\r\nfor, as it happened, he had given me an employment of that kind. As he\r\nwas coming out of the house he received a note from Rectina, the wife of\r\nBassus, who was in the utmost alarm at the imminent danger which\r\nthreatened her; for her villa being situated at the foot of Mount\r\nVesuvius, there was no way to escape but by sea; she earnestly entreated\r\nhim, therefore, to come to her assistance. He accordingly changed his\r\nfirst design, and what he began with a philosophical, he pursued with an\r\nheroical turn of mind. He ordered the galleys to put to sea, and went\r\nhimself on board with an intention of assisting, not only Rectina, but\r\nseveral others; for the villas stand extremely thick upon that beautiful\r\ncoast. When hastening to the place from whence others fled with the\r\nutmost terror, he steered his direct course to the point of danger, and\r\nwith so much calmness and presence of mind, as to be able to make and\r\ndictate his observations upon the motion and figure of that dreadful\r\nscene. He was now so nigh the mountain, that the cinders, which grew\r\nthicker and hotter the nearer he approached, fell into the ships,\r\ntogether with pumice stones, and black pieces of burning rock. They were\r\nlikewise in danger not only of being aground by the sudden retreat of\r\nthe sea, but also from the vast fragments which rolled down from the\r\nmountain, and obstructed all the shore. Here he stopped to consider\r\nwhether he should return back again; to which the pilot advising him,\r\n‘Fortune,’ said he, ‘befriends the brave; carry me to Pomponianus.’\r\nPomponianus was then at Stabiæ, separated by a gulf, which the sea,\r\nafter several insensible windings, forms upon the shore. He had already\r\nsent his baggage on board; for though he was not at that time in actual\r\ndanger, yet being within the view of it, and indeed extremely near, if\r\nit should in the least increase, he was determined to put to sea as soon\r\nas the wind should change. It was favourable, however, for carrying my\r\nuncle to Pomponianus, whom he found in the greatest consternation. He\r\nembraced him with tenderness, encouraged and exhorted him to keep up his\r\nspirits, and the more to dissipate his fears, he ordered, with an air of\r\nunconcern, the bath to be got ready; when, after having bathed, he sat\r\ndown to supper with great cheerfulness, or at least, what is equally\r\nheroic, with all the appearance of it. In the meanwhile, the eruption\r\nfrom Mount Vesuvius flamed out in several places with much violence,\r\nwhich the darkness of the night contributed to render still more visible\r\nand dreadful. But my uncle, in order to soothe the apprehensions of his\r\nfriend, assured him it was only the burning of the villages, which the\r\ncountry people had abandoned to the flames; after this he retired to\r\nrest, and it is most certain he was so little discomposed as to fall\r\ninto a deep sleep, for being pretty fat, and breathing hard, those who\r\nattended without, actually heard him snore. The court which led to his\r\napartment being now almost filled with stones and ashes, if he had\r\ncontinued there any time longer, it would have been impossible for him\r\nto have made his way out; it was thought proper therefore to awaken him.\r\nHe got up and went to Pomponianus and the rest of his company, who were\r\nunconcerned enough to think of going to bed. They consulted together\r\nwhether it would be most prudent to trust to the houses, which now shook\r\nfrom side to side with frequent and violent concussions, or fly to the\r\nopen fields, where the calcined stones and cinders, though light indeed,\r\nyet fell in large showers, and threatened destruction. In this distress\r\nthey resolved for the fields, as the less dangerous situation of the\r\ntwo. A resolution which, while the rest of the company were hurried into\r\nby their fears, my uncle embraced upon cool and deliberate\r\nconsideration. They went out then having pillows tied upon their heads\r\nwith napkins, and this was their whole defence against the storm of\r\nstones that fell round them. It was now day everywhere else, but there a\r\ndeeper darkness prevailed than in the most obscure night; which,\r\nhowever, was in some degree dissipated by torches and other lights of\r\nvarious kinds. They thought proper to go down farther upon the shore, to\r\nobserve if they might safely put out to sea, but they found the waves\r\nstill run extremely high and boisterous. There my uncle having drank a\r\ndraught or two of cold water, threw himself down upon a cloth which was\r\nspread for him, when immediately the flames, and a strong smell of\r\nsulphur, which was the forerunner of them, dispersed the rest of the\r\ncompany, and obliged him to arise. He raised himself up with the\r\nassistance of two of his servants, and instantly fell down, dead,\r\nsuffocated, as I conjecture, by some gross and noxious vapour, having\r\nalways had weak lungs, and frequently subject to a difficulty of\r\nbreathing. As soon as it was light again, which was not till the third\r\nday after this melancholy accident, his body was found entire, and\r\nwithout any marks of violence upon it, exactly in the same posture that\r\nhe fell, and looking more like a man asleep than dead.\r\n\r\n“During all this time my mother and I, who were at Misenum--but as this\r\nhas no connection with your history, so your inquiry went no farther\r\nthan concerning my uncle’s death; with that therefore I will put an end\r\nto my letter. Suffer me only to add, that I have faithfully related to\r\nyou what I was either an eyewitness of myself, or received immediately\r\nafter the accident happened, and before there was time to vary the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n“You will choose out of this narrative such circumstances as shall be\r\nmost suitable to your purpose; for there is a great difference between\r\nwhat is proper for a letter and a history--between writing to a friend\r\nand writing to the public. Farewell.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CORNELIUS TACITUS.\r\n\r\n“The letter which, in compliance with your request, I wrote concerning\r\nthe death of my uncle, has raised, it seems, your curiosity to know what\r\nterrors and dangers attended me, while I continued at Misenum; for\r\nthere, I think, the account in my former broke off. Though my shocked\r\nsoul recoils, my tongue shall tell. My uncle having left us, I pursued\r\nthe studies which prevented my going with him, till it was time to\r\nbathe. After which I went to supper, and from thence to bed, where my\r\nsleep was greatly broken and disturbed. There had been for many days\r\nbefore some shocks of an earthquake, which the less surprised us as they\r\nare extremely frequent in Campania; but they were so particularly\r\nviolent that night, that they not only shook every thing about us, but\r\nseemed indeed to threaten total destruction. My mother flew to my\r\nchamber, where she found me rising, in order to awaken her. We went out\r\ninto a small court belonging to the house, which separated the sea from\r\nthe buildings. As I was at that time but eighteen years of age, I know\r\nnot whether I should call my behaviour in this dangerous juncture\r\ncourage or rashness; but I took up Livy and amused myself with turning\r\nover that author, and even making extracts from him, as if all about me\r\nhad been in full security. While we were in this posture, a friend of\r\nmy uncle’s who was just come from Spain to pay a visit, joined us, and\r\nobserving me sitting by my mother with a book in my hand, greatly\r\ncondemned her calmness, at the same time that he reproved me for my\r\ncareless security; nevertheless I still went on with my author. Though\r\nit was now morning, the light was exceedingly faint and languid; the\r\nbuildings all around us tottered, and though we stood upon open ground,\r\nyet as the place was narrow and confined, there was no remaining there\r\nwithout certain and great danger; we therefore resolved to quit the\r\ntown. The people followed us in the utmost consternation, and (as to the\r\nmind distracted with terror, every suggestion seems more prudent than\r\nits own) pressed in great crowds about us in our way out. Being got at a\r\nconvenient distance from the houses, we stood still, in the midst of a\r\nmost dangerous and dreadful scene. The chariots which we had ordered to\r\nbe drawn out, were so agitated backwards and forwards, though upon the\r\nmost level ground, that we could not keep them steady, even by\r\nsupporting them with large stones. The sea seemed to roll back upon\r\nitself, and to be driven from its banks by the convulsive motion of the\r\nearth; it is certain, at least, the shore was considerably enlarged, and\r\nseveral sea animals were left upon it. On the other side a black and\r\ndreadful cloud, bursting with an igneous serpentine vapour, darted out a\r\nlong train of fire resembling flashes of lightning, but much larger.\r\nUpon this our Spanish friend, whom I mentioned above, addressing himself\r\nto my mother and me with greater warmth and earnestness, ‘If your\r\nbrother and your uncle,’ said he, ‘is safe, he certainly wishes you may\r\nbe so too; but if he perished, it was his desire, no doubt, that you\r\nmight both survive him. Why, therefore, do you delay your escape a\r\nmoment?’ ‘We could never think of our own safety,’ we said, ‘while we\r\nwere uncertain of his.’ Hereupon our friend left us, and withdrew from\r\nthe danger with the utmost precipitation. Soon afterwards the cloud\r\nseemed to descend and cover the whole ocean; as indeed it entirely hid\r\nthe island of Caprea and the promontory of Misenum. My mother strongly\r\nconjured me to make my escape at any rate, which, as I was young, I\r\nmight easily do; as for herself, she said, her age and corpulency\r\nrendered all attempts of that sort impossible; however, she should\r\nwillingly meet death, if she could have the satisfaction of seeing that\r\nshe was not the occasion of mine. But I absolutely refused to leave her,\r\nand taking her by the hand, I led her on: she complied with great\r\nreluctance, and not without many reproaches to herself for retarding my\r\nflight. The ashes now begun to fall upon us, though in no great\r\nquantity; I turned my head, and observed behind us a thick smoke, which\r\ncame rolling after us like a torrent. I proposed, while we had yet any\r\nlight, to turn out of the high road, lest we should be pressed to death\r\nin the dark, by the crowd that followed us. We had scarce stepped out of\r\nthe path, when a darkness overspread us, not like that of a cloudy\r\nnight, or when there is no moon, but of a room when it is shut up, and\r\nall the lights extinct. Nothing then was to be heard but the shrieks of\r\nwomen, the screams of children, and the cries of men; some calling for\r\ntheir children, others for their parents, others for their husbands, and\r\nonly distinguishing each other by their voices; one lamenting his own\r\nfate, another that of his family; some wishing to die, from the very\r\nfear of dying; some lifting up their hands to the gods; but the greater\r\npart imagining that the last and eternal night was come, which was to\r\ndestroy both the gods and the world together. Among these there are some\r\nwho augmented the real terrors by imaginary ones, and made the frighted\r\nmultitude falsely believe that Misenum was actually in flames. At length\r\na glimmering light appeared, which we imagined to be rather the\r\nforerunner of an approaching burst of flames (as in truth it was), than\r\nthe return of day; however, the fire fell at a distance from us: then\r\nagain we were immersed in thick darkness, and a heavy shower of ashes\r\nrained upon us, which we were obliged every now and then to shake off,\r\notherwise we should have been crushed and buried in the heap; I might\r\nboast that, during all this scene of horror, not a sigh or expression of\r\nfear escaped from me; had not my support been founded in that miserable,\r\nthough strong consolation, that all mankind were involved in the same\r\ncalamity, and that I imagined I was perishing with the world itself. At\r\nlast this dreadful darkness was dissipated by degrees, like a cloud of\r\nsmoke; the real day returned, and even the sun appeared, though very\r\nfaintly, and as when an eclipse is coming on. Every object that\r\npresented itself to our eyes (which were extremely weakened) seemed\r\nchanged, being covered over with white ashes as with a deep snow. We\r\nreturned to Misenum, where we refreshed ourselves as well as we could,\r\nand passed an anxious night between hope and fear, though, indeed, with\r\na much larger share of the latter; for the earthquake still continued,\r\nwhile several enthusiastic people ran up and down, heightening their own\r\nand their friend’s calamities, by terrible predictions. However, my\r\nmother and I, notwithstanding the danger we had passed, and that which\r\nstill threatened us, had no thoughts of leaving the place till we\r\nshould receive some account of my uncle.\r\n\r\n“And now you will read this narrative without any view of inserting it\r\nin your history, of which it is by no means worthy; and indeed you must\r\nimpute it to your own request, if it shall appear scarce to deserve even\r\nthe trouble of a letter. Farewell.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after the catastrophe all memorials of the devoted cities were\r\nlost; discussions on the places they had once occupied were excited only\r\nby some obscure passages in classical authors. Five successive eruptions\r\ncontributed to bury them still deeper under the surface, and the sixth,\r\nwhich occurred in the year 1036, is the first instance of an emission of\r\nlava. Before that time the only agents of desolation were showers of\r\nsand, cinders, and scoriæ, together with loose fragments of rock.\r\nVolcanic ashes poured out in a current have been known to darken the air\r\nfor hours, and even for days. Such must have been the nature of the\r\nphenomenon which the younger Pliny saw and compared to a lofty pine.\r\nDion Cassius states that the ashes of this eruption were carried as far\r\nas Africa, and that the dust was so abundant as even to darken the air\r\nin the neighbourhood of Rome. Steam poured out in vast quantities, and\r\nuniting with the ashes that fell upon Herculaneum, formed a torrent of\r\nmud, imbedding all in solid tufa, whilst the ashes of Pompeii were not\r\nimpregnated, and all lay in this city loose and unconsolidated. Stones\r\nof eight pounds weight fell on Pompeii, whilst Stabiæ was overwhelmed\r\nwith fragments of about an ounce in weight, which must have drifted in\r\nimmense quantities. During a later eruption fine ashes were borne by the\r\nwind as far as Constantinople. Whilst the ancient cities thus lay buried\r\nand forgotten, Neapolis, the residence and burial-place of Virgil,[50]\r\ngrew into the great modern city of Naples, extending its suburban\r\nvillages along the shore, and connecting itself by a chain of houses to\r\nthe very roots of Vesuvius. The next town to Naples is Portici. It\r\ncontains 6000 inhabitants. Immediately adjoining Portici is the still\r\nlarger town of Resina, with a population of 11,000 souls. These bustling\r\nand much frequented places are built upon the lava which covers\r\nHerculaneum.\r\n\r\n  [50] See Portrait Gallery, No. 121.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE ANCIENT CITIES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of the Bay of Naples, showing the relative positions\r\nof Naples, Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Stabiæ to Mount Vesuvius.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1689, during some excavations in the plain at the foot of\r\nVesuvius, where it was subsequently proved that Pompeii had flourished,\r\na workman observed the regularity with which successive layers of earth\r\nand volcanic matter had been deposited. He compared them to pavements\r\none upon the other; with remains of burnt vegetation, charcoal, and\r\ncommon earth beneath each volcanic deposit. Under one of these dense\r\nmasses of scoria, dust, and pumice stone, he found large quantities of\r\ncarbonised timber, locks, and iron work, evidently the remains of\r\nhabitations, which, together with some old keys, and inscriptions giving\r\nthe name of the locality, satisfied the learned of the day that they\r\nbelonged to the ancient city of Pompeii. (Venuti, p. 37. Mém. de\r\nl’Académie Fran.; Mém. de Littérature, tom. xv. Des Embrasemens du Mont\r\nVésuve, and also Bianchini, Istoria Universale, Roma, 1699, p. 246.\r\nCochin, p. 31). The discovery created little excitement at the time; the\r\ngovernment was indisposed to prosecute the research, and no farther\r\nexcavation was carried on till the year 1749.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the accidental sinking of a well in another place brought to\r\nlight such treasures of art as to induce a systematic exploration in a\r\nmore profitable locality. This was in the neighbourhood of Naples, where\r\nafter seventeen centuries the city of Herculaneum was once more rescued\r\nfrom oblivion. The circumstances which led to the discovery are briefly\r\nthese. The prince D’Elbœuf, of the house of Lorraine, came to Naples in\r\n1706 (Cochin, p. 35), and ordered the construction of a marine villa for\r\nhimself at Portici, in 1711. (Venuti, p. 38. Gori, Admiranda, p. 39.) He\r\nhad a Frenchman in his service, who possessed the art of making a\r\ndurable stucco from pulverised marble, and as many fragments of antique\r\nmarbles as possible were collected for the manufacture of his\r\ncomposition. One day a countryman presented himself, asserting that in\r\nsinking a well at Resina (Venuti, p. 39), he had discovered a variety of\r\nprecious marbles, some of which he had brought with him as specimens.\r\nThese marbles were so beautiful and rare, that the prince was induced to\r\npurchase of the man the right of further excavation, and he immediately\r\ncommenced a systematic course of exploration upon that spot. The stucco\r\nprepared by the Frenchman was not only an imitation of precious marbles,\r\nbut also a cement similar to that employed by the ancients. Most of the\r\nantique buildings were so plastered internally, as it was harder and\r\nmore durable than marble in its natural state. The excavators,\r\ntherefore, were more delighted when they found large plain slabs and\r\nshafts of columns than elaborately carved foliage and statues, because\r\nthe latter afforded them a smaller quantity of actual material.\r\nStendardo was appointed to direct the works which were carried on\r\nbranching sideways from the well, just above the level of the water;\r\n(Gori, p. 40. Venuti, p. 39. Cochin, p. 37;) at the expiration of two\r\ndays, they found a statue of Hercules, evidently from a Grecian chisel,\r\nand they remarked with astonishment that it had formerly been restored\r\n(Gori, p. 40). Some days after this they came upon a female statue,\r\nwhich was at once pronounced to be a Cleopatra (Gori, p. 40). They next\r\nextricated a large square mass of marble, and upon removing a crust of\r\nbituminous matter it was found to be the architrave of a gateway, with\r\nletters of bronze inlaid into the surface. The inscription was\r\n\r\n  APPIVS. PVLCHER. CAII. FILIVS.\r\n              VIR. EPVLONVM.     (Venuti, p. 39.)\r\n\r\nMany columns of variegated alabaster were next discovered, and this led\r\nto the excavation of a circular temple, with twenty-four columns, and\r\nstatues of Greek marble between them (Gori, p. 41). The pavement of this\r\nbuilding was constructed of that rich yellow marble, called _Giallo\r\nantico_, and many columns of the same material lay in the vicinity.\r\nSeven of the twelve figures belonging to the temple were female,\r\nexecuted in a superior Grecian style. Prince Elbœuf dispatched them to\r\nVienna as a present to Prince Eugene of Savoy (Venuti, p. 39). The best\r\nof these statues were afterwards sold to the King of Poland for 60,000\r\nscudi; they are now at Dresden, and engraved in plates 19 to 26 of\r\nBecker’s “Augusteum” (Winckelmann, Werke, vol. ii. p. 135). The prince\r\nevidently knew very little of the real value of his discoveries, and\r\nduring the next five years continued disinterring pieces of mosaic\r\nalabaster slabs, and a few statues, some of which decorated his villa,\r\nand the rest were sent over to France. Upon the discovery of a beautiful\r\nstatue of one of the daughters of Balbus, the state interfered, and the\r\nNeapolitan government prohibited any further excavations. For thirty\r\nyears the site was almost forgotten. In 1736, the King Carlo III.\r\n(Borbone) resolved to build a palace at Portici, and the ancient well\r\nwas once more resorted to. The excavations were resumed, and very\r\nimportant results followed.\r\n\r\nAnimated discussions were still maintained respecting the name of the\r\nancient city, for a city the excavations had already proved it to be. A\r\ncommunication to the Royal Society by a Mr. Sloane, in 1740, exhibits\r\nthe matter as still in a state of uncertainty. The Marquis Venuti,\r\nkeeper of the Farnese library which Carlo Borbone had inherited from\r\nRome, was appointed superintendent of the excavations at Resina. He has\r\nleft minute records of his proceedings both in the “Admiranda Notizia,”\r\n2 et. seq., of Gori, and in his own work published at Venice and London,\r\n1750. He commenced 12th November, 1738, by carrying on a kind of tunnel\r\nlaterally from the old well. In a short time (Venuti, p. 40. Gori, p.\r\n42) two bronze equestrian statues were found, and soon after three full\r\nlength marble figures, larger than life, of Roman dignitaries, dressed\r\nin the toga, with massive piers of brick between, plastered with stucco,\r\nand painted with arabesques in various colours. The excavators had now\r\nreached the interior of the theatre, which the numerous seats and steps\r\nclearly indicated. An inscription, moreover, on the architrave contained\r\npart of the word Theatre, the name of the person at whose cost the\r\nbuilding was erected, and that of the architect. A second inscription on\r\nthe corresponding architrave of the opposite side is almost a\r\nrepetition:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  L. ANNIVS. L. F. MAMMIANVS. RVFVS. IIVIR. QVINQ. [TH]EA[T]R... O....\r\n  P. NVMISIVS. ARC... TEC...]\r\n\r\n  (Gori, p. 42. Venuti, p. 42.)\r\n\r\nThese architraves covered the side entrances to the orchestra, and both\r\nof them supported a colossal group in bronze of a chariot and two\r\nhorses. The central group of the building was a quadriga, and probably\r\nrepresented the emperor in his chariot with four horses. All these\r\nbronze statues had been gilt. Some fine columns of rosso antico were\r\ntransported to the cathedral of Naples, and others to the Royal Palace;\r\nthey appear to have adorned the proscenium (Venuti, p. 71). The theatre\r\nwas one of the most perfect specimens of ancient architecture. It had,\r\nfrom the floor, upwards of eighteen rows of seats (Gori, 44), and above\r\nthese three other rows which seem to have been intended for the female\r\npart of the audience, and were covered with a portico to screen them\r\nfrom the rays of the sun. Statues of Drusus and Antonia, and of the nine\r\nMuses, were found in other parts of the building. A bronze colossal\r\nstatue of Titus filled with lead (Gori, p. 45) was so heavy that twelve\r\nmen were unable to move it. Many other bronze statues of municipal\r\nauthorities and benefactors were found with their respective\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe theatre was capable of containing 8000 persons. Nearly the whole of\r\nits surface, as well as the arched walks leading to the seats, was cased\r\nwith marble. The area or pit was floored with thick squares of _giallo\r\nantico_, the beautiful marble of a yellowish hue. The pedestal, of white\r\nmarble, which supported a chariot and four bronze horses, is still to be\r\nseen in its place; but the group itself had been crushed and broken in\r\npieces by the immense weight of lava which fell on it. The fragments\r\nhaving been collected, might have been easily reunited, but they were\r\ncarelessly thrown into a corner, like old iron, and part of them were\r\nstolen. The body of one horse and part of the charioteer, being deemed\r\nuseless, were accordingly fused, to be converted into two large framed\r\nmedallions of their Neapolitan Majesties. The remaining fragments were\r\ncast into the vaults of the royal palace; and, at last, it was resolved\r\nto make the best use of what was left; which was, to convert the four\r\nhorses into one, by taking a fore leg of one of them, a hinder leg of\r\nanother, the head of a third, and where the breach was irremediable, to\r\ncast a new piece. To this contrivance, the famous bronze horse now in\r\nthe Museum owes its existence; and, considering its patchwork origin,\r\nstill conveys a high idea of the skill of the ancient artist. A pompous\r\ninscription upon its pedestal records the circumstances of its\r\nconstruction (Bronzi di Ercolano, vol. ii., page 255).\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the theatre, stood a basilica or public building\r\nwhich contained the celebrated equestrian statues of the Balbi--of one\r\nblock of marble (Gori, p. 59),--These fine statues possess the\r\nadditional value of having finally set at rest the question respecting\r\nthe proper name of the city. On the front of the pedestals is\r\ninscribed--\r\n\r\n  M. NONIO. M. F.\r\n  BALBO. PR. PRO. COS.\r\n  HERCVLANENSES.\r\n\r\n  (Gerhard, Neapel. p. 22. Gori, p. 167. Venuti, p. 59.)\r\n\r\nThe certainty of this city having been the ancient Herculaneum is said\r\nto have materially increased the energy of the excavators. In the same\r\nbasilica were found the famous pictures of Hercules and Telephus,\r\nTheseus and the Minotaur, and many others, together with bronze statues\r\nof Nero and Germanicus, and a Vespasian, with two sitting figures of\r\nmarble, nine feet high. The streets of the city were paved with blocks\r\nof lava, they were flanked with causeways, and lined with porticos. The\r\nprivate buildings, which resembled those of Pompeii, were very difficult\r\nof access, from the nature of the material that overwhelmed them, and\r\ncould only be examined in small portions at a time. No maps of\r\nsufficient accuracy have been laid down of the earliest excavations, and\r\nit will be better to reserve all accounts of domestic arrangements till\r\nwe can illustrate them by the Pompeian remains. One large villa,\r\nhowever, seems to have been a very important structure. It was\r\nsurrounded by a garden enclosed within a square wall and ditch. The\r\nfloors were ornamented with beautiful mosaics and the halls contained a\r\nrich variety of busts and statues. One of the chambers served the\r\npurpose of a bath; another, supposed to have been a sacrarium, was\r\npainted with serpents, and within it was found a brazen tripod,\r\ncontaining cinders and ashes; but the most curious discovery of all, was\r\nan apartment in this villa used as a library, and fitted up with wooden\r\npresses around the walls, about six feet in height; a double row of\r\npresses stood in the middle of the room, so as to admit of a free\r\npassage on every side. The wood of which the presses had been made was\r\nburned to a cinder, and gave way at the first touch; but the volumes,\r\ncomposed of a much more perishable substance, the Egyptian or Syracusan\r\npapyrus, were, although completely carbonised, through the effect of the\r\nheat, still so far preserved as to admit of their removal. A number of\r\nthese supposed pieces of charcoal were at first carried off, which by\r\naccidental fracture exposed the remains of letters and proved to be so\r\nmany ancient manuscripts. The Greek manuscripts consisted of rolls\r\nscarcely a foot in length, and but two or three inches in thickness.\r\nSome had a label in front, at one end of the roll, with the name of the\r\nwork or the author, which was visible from its place in the library.[51]\r\n\r\n  [51] See a Pompeian painting described at p. 50, Cubiculum 3.\r\n\r\nThe sixteen centuries during which the substances had been crushed\r\ntogether, rendered it almost hopeless to unroll, and still less to\r\ndecipher them; but Camillo Paderni devoted twelve days to the occupation\r\nunderground, and succeeded in carrying away 337 manuscripts. Almost all\r\nare in Greek, very few in Latin, and some of the rolls are forty or\r\nfifty feet in length. The lines are arranged in columns across the\r\nshortest surface, as in our newspapers, each line extending only about\r\ntwo or three inches in length. The greater part of the works in this\r\ncollection relate to Epicurean philosophy. Their decipherment has\r\nnaturally occupied much of the attention of the learned, and many of the\r\nmanuscripts have been published at Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Herculaneum was at the period of its discovery more\r\ninteresting and much more worthy the notice of the traveller than it is\r\nat present. The object of its excavation having unfortunately been\r\nconfined to the discovery of statues, paintings, and other curiosities,\r\nand not carried on with a view to lay open the city, and thus to\r\nascertain the features of its buildings and streets, most of the latter\r\nwere again filled up with rubbish as soon as they were divested of\r\neverything moveable. Even the marble was torn from the temples.\r\n\r\nHerculaneum may therefore be said to have been overwhelmed a second time\r\nby its modern discoverers; and the appearance it previously presented\r\ncan now only be ascertained from the accounts of those who beheld it in\r\na more perfect state. The existence of the large towns of Portici and\r\nResina overhead render it impossible for many parts of the excavations\r\nto remain open to the sky; one portion, however, was allowed to be so\r\nuntil the sinking of the main road, subject to incessant traffic,\r\ncompelled the government to have the undercuttings filled in, and the\r\napertures blocked up. A part of the city nearer to the mountain has been\r\nthrown open and the sun is again permitted to shine upon gardens and\r\nhabitations now desolate and mouldering.\r\n\r\nFrom the hard nature of the rock at Herculaneum, the city was for a long\r\ntime supposed to have been buried in lava, and the darkness and\r\nobscurity of the passages prevented the discovery of the truth. But now,\r\nsince daylight has been admitted, the whole mass is found to be nothing\r\nmore than hard tufa, rendered, at the lower parts, still more compact by\r\nthe percolation of water, which in all cases leaves the finest possible\r\nsediment. Lava is stone that has been actually melted, and flows over\r\nthe surface in the same way as molten iron issues from a furnace. The\r\nbeds of real lava may be easily distinguished in the upper levels of the\r\nearth laid open in these excavations. All the timber of the houses has\r\nbeen completely reduced to charcoal, but every beam was found perfect as\r\nto shape and in its proper position; many of the bronzes, however, were\r\nmelted. These effects seem to be the result of an intense heat diffused\r\nthrough the entire mass at a subsequent period; for, at the time of the\r\nfirst eruption, great quantities of boiling water appear to have been\r\nmixed with the fine dust and scoria, the same materials that fell dry\r\nand loose upon Pompeii.\r\n\r\nAn entrance from the road at Resina to the excavations was formed in\r\n1750. It is still the only means of access to the most important\r\nbuildings, and consists of a narrow passage cut through the solid lava.\r\nThe ancient city lies at a depth of seventy feet below the modern level.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty of excavating Herculaneum, on account of the soil\r\nabove being occupied by crowded habitations, induced the government to\r\nturn their attention more particularly to Pompeii.\r\n\r\n“Nearly seventeen centuries had rolled away when the City of Pompeii was\r\ndisinterred from its silent tomb, all vivid with undimmed hues; its\r\nwalls fresh as if painted yesterday, not a hue faded on the rich mosaic\r\nof its floors; in its forum the half-finished columns as left by the\r\nworkman’s hands; in its gardens the sacrificial tripod; in its halls the\r\nchest of treasure; in its baths the strigil; in its theatres the counter\r\nof admission; in its saloons the furniture and the lamp; in its\r\ntriclinia the fragments of the last feast; in its cubicula the perfumes\r\nand the rouge of faded beauty; and everywhere the bones and skeletons of\r\nthose who once moved the springs of that minute, yet gorgeous machine of\r\nluxury and of life.\r\n\r\n“In the house of Diomed, in the subterranean vaults, twenty skeletons\r\n(one of a babe) were discovered in one spot by the door, covered by a\r\nfine ashen dust, that had evidently been wafted slowly through the\r\napertures, until it had filled the whole space. There were jewels and\r\ncoins, candelabra for unavailing light, and wine hardened in the amphoræ\r\nfor a prolongation of agonised life. The sand, consolidated by damps,\r\nhad taken the forms of the skeletons as in a cast; and the traveller may\r\nyet see the impression of a female neck and bosom of young and round\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n“It seems to the inquirer as if the air had been gradually changed into\r\na sulphurous vapour; the inmates of the vaults had rushed to the door to\r\nfind it closed and blocked up by the scoria without, and, in their\r\nattempts to force it, had been suffocated with the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n“In the garden was found a skeleton with a key by its bony hand, and\r\nnear it a bag of coins. This is believed to have been the master of the\r\nhouse, who had probably sought to escape by the garden, and been\r\ndestroyed either by the vapours or some fragment of stone. Beside some\r\nsilver vases lay another skeleton, probably of a slave.\r\n\r\n“The houses of Sallust and of Pansa, the temple of Isis, with the\r\njuggling concealments behind the statues--the lurking place of its holy\r\noracles--are now bared to the gaze of the curious. In one of the\r\nchambers of that temple was found a huge skeleton with an axe by the\r\nside of it: two walls had been pierced by the axe--the victim could\r\npenetrate no farther. In the midst of the city was found another\r\nskeleton, by the side of which was a heap of coins and many of the\r\nmystic ornaments of the fane of Isis.”[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] Bulwer’s “Last Days of Pompeii.”\r\n\r\nLinen and fishing nets; loaves of bread with the impress of the baker’s\r\nname; even fruits, as walnuts, almonds, peach-stones, and chestnuts,\r\nwere distinctly recognisable. Eggs have been found whole and empty, and\r\na jar of oil had olives still floating in it; the oil burnt upon\r\napplication of flame, but the fruit was flavourless. Very few jewels\r\nwere discovered, which shows that the inhabitants had time to escape; a\r\nwooden comb was found with teeth on both sides, closer on one side than\r\nthe other. Lace fabricated of pure gold, a folding parasol similar to\r\nthose now in use, a case of surgeon’s instruments, balances, sculptors’\r\ntools, chisels and compasses, writing materials, vessels of white cut\r\nand coloured glass, coals collected for fuel, and wine still remaining\r\nin jars, may all be found in the curious catalogue of articles that had\r\nbraved the lapse of time. Other circumstances there are which claim our\r\nbetter feelings. At the city gate, the sentinel, faithful to his trust,\r\nwas found in his sentry box, a skeleton, clothed in\r\n\r\n    “The very armour he had on,”\r\n\r\nwhen his dreadful doom overtook him; in the barracks, near the\r\ntriangular forum, malefactors were found in the public stocks; the\r\ncrumbling remains of prisoners were discovered in the dungeons near the\r\ntemple of Jupiter, no one in that hour of general horror and confusion\r\nhaving thought of them or of their wretchedness, in being thus immured\r\nalive. The bones of the ass, that worked the baker’s mill, were found\r\nthere; the skeletons of horses remained in the cribs in which they had\r\nbeen stabled for the last time.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries that had been made long before the arrival of Prince\r\nElbœuf, and which were communicated to the French Academy of Science,\r\n1689, were remembered by the Neapolitan Government, and in the beginning\r\nof the year 1749 we have the first authentic reference to the ancient\r\ncity of Pompeii. “On the 18th of January, at a place called Civita,” so\r\nruns the official announcement, “not far from Torre dell’ Annunciata,\r\nwhere the ancient Pompeii may have been, was found an apartment\r\ndecorated with sixteen charming little dancing females brightly\r\ncoloured, two centaurs and figures, bands of arabesques forming panels\r\nwith Cupids in the midst, and twelve fauns dancing on a rope, all upon a\r\nblack ground.” (Pitture d’Ercolano, vol. i., p. 93, tavole 17 to 28, and\r\nvol. iii., tavole 28 to 35 inclusive.) They are very small figures, and\r\nhave since been removed to the Museo Borbonico. About the same time a\r\nlabourer, whilst ploughing in the neighbouring fields, found a statue of\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest buildings excavated at Pompeii was the Amphitheatre;\r\nit was cleared in 1755, and seems to have been capable of holding ten\r\nthousand people (Pompeiana, p. 259). In the amphitheatre, games were\r\nheld, gladiators fought for their lives with wild beasts, or with one\r\nanother, and these savage spectacles were under the particular\r\nsuperintendence of an edile. We are informed by Dion Cassius, that the\r\neruption came on whilst the populace were assembled in the theatre, but\r\nwhich of the theatres is meant, as there were several, remains doubtful.\r\nThus far is certain, that sufficient time was left for escape, as no\r\nskeletons were found in either of them. From the seats of this\r\namphitheatre may certainly be obtained the grandest view of the\r\nmountain, and if, as Bulwer’s admirable romance “the Last Days of\r\nPompeii” depicts it, the assembly was held on this spot, the first signs\r\nof the coming destruction would have been seen by all the multitude. An\r\nannouncement connected with these performances has since been discovered\r\nupon the walls of the Basilica. A placard--the playbill of those\r\ntimes--announced that the troops of gladiators belonging to Ampliatus\r\nwould contend in the amphitheatre on the 17th of May, and that another\r\nexhibition would take place on the 31st, exactly three months before the\r\ndestruction of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Isis was accidentally discovered in 1765, by some workmen\r\nemployed in making a subterraneous aqueduct to Torre dell’ Annunciata.\r\nThese discoveries induced Charles III. to transfer his attention\r\nexclusively to Pompeii (Pompeiana, p. 5). The Triangular Forum, the\r\nTemple of Æsculapius, and the two great theatres were all laid open in\r\nthe course of two or three successive years. These buildings are all in\r\nthe same quarter of the town, but quite remote from the great forum and\r\npublic buildings which were not discovered until 1816.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that Fontana, the great architect, carried a\r\nsubterraneous canal in 1592 directly under the court of the Temple of\r\nIsis. He was employed to convey the waters of the river Sarno to the\r\ntown of Torre dell’ Annunziata; and it seems wonderful that the\r\nexistence of this interesting city was not made known at the time.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Pompeii, as it originally stood upon an elevation\r\nsurrounded by a fertile plain, is well shown in the accompanying view.\r\nThe eminence marked in the woodcut by the long pale light mounds on the\r\nright between the tower of a farm-house and the base of the volcano, is\r\nthe site of the city. Pompeii was never buried beneath the surface of\r\nthe ground; on the contrary, many of its walls were always\r\n_conspicuous_, as, for instance, that at the back of the tragic theatre.\r\nThe locality seems to have been known to the peasants of the vicinity by\r\nthe name of _civita_ (city). The rains of successive seasons may\r\nprobably have carried away most of the stones and ashes that fell around\r\nthe city, whilst the walls of the houses themselves would serve to\r\nretain all that had fallen upon them.\r\n\r\nOther villas also were excavated at Gragnano, the ancient Stabiæ, and\r\nmost of their decorations were removed to the Museo Borbonico. The baths\r\ndiscovered at Stabiæ, in 1827, were very interesting. They are described\r\nin “Gell’s Pompeiana,” 2nd series, vol. i. pp. 131 and 140.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBay of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe river Sarnus.\r\n\r\nMounds marking the extent of Pompeii.\r\n\r\nVIEW OF VESUVIUS, FROM BETWEEN CASTELLAMARE AND GRAGNANO.]\r\n\r\nFor our present purpose, the public buildings and temples of Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum require a less detailed account; a slight enumeration of\r\nthem, however, is necessary to show the extent and importance of the\r\ncommunity, whose taste and refinement required such dwellings for their\r\nprivate enjoyment, and also to prove that the buildings, from which many\r\nof the designs on the walls of the Pompeian Court have been taken, do\r\nnot owe their origin to the slight and flimsy taste prevailing among\r\nthe frequenters of a seaside town in the modern sense of the word, but\r\nto the higher refinement and habits of those who, leaving Rome in the\r\nheat of a summer sun, sought the ease and indulgence of a life such as\r\nCampania alone afforded, and yet could not tolerate the contrast of an\r\ninferior art around them. This is proved by a comparison of the Pompeian\r\ndecorations with those of the same period in the baths of Titus, at\r\nRome. The same style and the same peculiarities of taste are evident,\r\nand they perfectly illustrate the remarks of Vitruvius, which will be\r\nconsidered in a future place.\r\n\r\nWhen the French occupied Naples, the walls surrounding the city were\r\nentirely cleared; this was in October, 1812, and in the March following\r\nthe street of tombs. Murat defrayed most of the expenses of excavation,\r\nand in a short time the Forum and Basilica, with the adjacent buildings,\r\nwere laid open. At one time 3000 men were employed in the work of\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nThe Forum (1816) is the largest and by far the grandest spot in Pompeii.\r\nIt is surrounded by a Grecian Doric colonnade, the Temple of Jupiter,\r\ntwo triumphal arches, forming the north end, and the Temple of Venus and\r\nBasilica on the west. Facing the Temple of Jupiter were large buildings,\r\nprofusely decorated with statues, called the Curiæ and Ærarium, and the\r\nremaining side of the forum was occupied by various buildings, among\r\nthem the Pantheon and the Chalcidicum of Eumachia; these were excavated\r\nbetween 1817 and 1821. The discovery of the public baths did not take\r\nplace till 1824. These contributed materially to a better comprehension\r\nof many passages in ancient authors, being more perfect examples than\r\nthe vast ranges for similar purposes still existing at Rome.\r\n\r\nTlie general result of the Pompeian excavations up to the present time\r\nmay be thus summed up; three forums, nine temples, a basilica, a\r\nchalcidicum, three piazze, an amphitheatre, two theatres, a prison,\r\ndouble baths, nearly one hundred houses and shops, several villas, town\r\nwalls, six gates, and twelve tombs.\r\n\r\nThe impression likely to be produced on the mind of a spectator from the\r\nscene in its present condition, may be gathered from the following\r\npassages extracted from my own journal, recording my first visit to\r\nPompeii, September 16th, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“By half-past ten we were at the railway station, just outside the gates\r\nof Naples, and immediately started for Pompeii. The line of rail\r\ncontinues along the shore of the bay; nothing can exceed the bustle,\r\nconfusion, and want of system on this amusing road. There exists neither\r\ndistinction of classes nor limitation of luggage, so that fruit-stalls\r\nand puppet-shows--Polichinello, by the way, is here in his native\r\nland--are heaped together in the carriages. The first station we reached\r\nwas Portici, the next Resina, accompanied by the classic cry of\r\nErcolano--signore, Porta d’Ercolano--then Torre del Greco, where heaps\r\nof lava piled one upon the other, attest the awful eruption of the last\r\ncentury. Torre dell’ Annunciata being the nearest station to Pompeii we\r\nalighted here, and proceeded along a dusty road, lined with cactus,\r\npoplar, stone pine, and the castor-oil tree. Festoons of the richest\r\nvines hung from tree to tree, and the black clusters peeped out beneath\r\nthe broad-spread leaves, already beginning to change into the gold of\r\nthe approaching Autumn. The fields were teeming with corn, hemp, and\r\ncotton. No beggars, the pest of Naples, crowded round our carratella,\r\nand the dust which rolled in dense clouds was our only annoyance. We now\r\nturned our thoughts to Pompeii. A small guard house of soldiers marked\r\nthe entrance to these classic precincts, and for some distance further\r\nthe road was planted with willows, producing a rich and solemn effect,\r\nand well preparing us for the street of tombs which soon broke upon our\r\nview. The road was lined with tombs for a considerable distance before\r\nwe approached the city gate, called Porta d’Ercolano, on the Herculaneum\r\nside; but previously to examining the tombs, we diverged to the right to\r\nexplore the villa of Diomed, where we found everything in exact\r\naccordance with the description of Sir William Gell and Mr. Malkin’s\r\nwork, ‘Pompeii,’ by the Society of Entertaining Knowledge.\r\n\r\n“The tombs are all small but minutely ornamented, the upper parts still\r\nremain, and they appear altogether much more complete than I had\r\nexpected. The gate of Herculaneum, with its grooves, sentry box, and\r\nroad-pavements, corresponds exactly with prints and descriptions given\r\nby numerous travellers.\r\n\r\n“At this point of view, little is really wanting. The eye pursues a long\r\nline of ascending road, with tombs and thick trees on each side, broken\r\nonly by the gate of the city, through the arch of which a long\r\ncontinuation of houses is clearly visible. We entered the city;\r\neverything is on a small scale, but the walls at this entrance to the\r\ncity seem high in proportion; the footway and carriage-road remain\r\nundisturbed, and still retain the track of chariot wheels. The motion\r\nand noise of inhabitants alone seem wanting--no decay is visible, and\r\nthe impression produced by the scene was that of a populous city during\r\nchurch time. We wandered on through streets and lanes, prying into\r\nbuildings both public and private, after the manner of that wonderful\r\nprince mentioned in the ‘Arabian Nights Entertainments,’ who explored a\r\ncity, the inhabitants of which had been turned into stone.\r\n\r\n“In the shops, many of the walls remain perfect, roofs alone have\r\ndisappeared, but counters, doorways, and depositaries are just such as\r\nwe see daily at Naples, and scarcely inferior in point of freshness.\r\n\r\n“The mosaic strewn floors are wonderfully perfect--a little patching and\r\ninequality of level caused by the previous earthquake are here and there\r\nperceptible; the chief difficulty at first is to know the floor from the\r\npavement, that is, to distinguish the inside of a house from the\r\ncourtyard. All external walls were plastered and coloured, so that a\r\nmistake might easily arise.\r\n\r\n“The Houses of the Quæstor, Sallust, and the Faun, are exquisite\r\nspecimens of proportion and arrangement in domestic building. The\r\nbeautifully painted walls, columns, and inlaid marble or mosaic floor,\r\ncombine with the deep blue sky, forming so glorious a whole that the\r\nrooflessness is forgotten, and the eye reposes with delight on the\r\nassembled harmonies.\r\n\r\n“The whole city is encompassed by enormous mounds of debris, under which\r\nit was formerly buried. These lumps are now caked together, and in their\r\nsloping sides trees have already sprung up, so that all appearance of\r\n_rubbish_ is fortunately concealed.\r\n\r\n“I was greatly disappointed with the scale of many objects, especially\r\nthe Baths. Sir William Gell’s views are very correct, but the living\r\nfigures introduced are on an utterly false scale. The Telamons, a series\r\nof terra-cotta figures, tinted red, with yellow hair and drapery,\r\nsupporting the frieze, seem, in his pictures, the size of life, whereas\r\nthey are only two feet high, one-third in fact of the size they are made\r\nto appear in his drawings.\r\n\r\n“Modern roofs are extended over all parts retaining ornament, stucco, or\r\npaintings; some of the finest mosaics are carefully boarded over--the\r\nfamous lion, for instance--whilst others are protected by coarse glass\r\nframes with slides such as we use for cucumber-beds in kitchen gardens.\r\nA beautiful marble pavement attracted our attention, in the house of\r\nActæon or Sallust, but the great mosaic of Darius is not visible, being\r\nplastered over preparatory to its removal to Naples. The borders alone\r\nremain uncovered. The Forum, with its Basilica, temples of Jupiter,\r\nVesta, and Venus, are only realisations of my previous conception,\r\nallowing, as before, for the reduction of size. The best mosaics,\r\npaintings, statues and bronzes have been removed to Naples, but their\r\nplace is frequently supplied by copies, which serve equally well to\r\nillustrate their effect.\r\n\r\n“The tragic theatre is complete in form; the stone seats, however, have\r\nnearly all disappeared. The amphitheatre is considerably distant from\r\nthe rest of the excavations; it is remarkably perfect, and the view of\r\nVesuvius from the summit of this building is surprisingly grand. It\r\ncontrasts strangely with the beautiful limestone range of mountains on\r\nthe other side of the bay. Vesuvius appears more rugged and frowning in\r\nthis aspect--beheld from the remains of its victim--than from the\r\nmore-frequently painted scene, the Chiaja of Naples. The deep blue and\r\ngray-brown of the volcano is studded with white dots, each of which is a\r\nvilla or hermitage, creeping up to the mouth of the crater, regardless\r\nof the warnings of the buried cities, and the devastation at its roots\r\nin Torre del Greco, and in Nola of the plain beyond. They seem like\r\nflies settled on the head of a sleeping monster, or, to speak in better\r\nphrase, like white sails on the calm and azure sea, which, at the moment\r\nI am writing, seems incapable of harbouring the terrors and destruction\r\nwhich mankind so frequently experience, and which two days ago we saw in\r\nall their sublimity.\r\n\r\n“In the baths of Pompeii a slight refreshment was offered us, and at a\r\nlittle farm-house in the neighbourhood of the amphitheatre, we enjoyed a\r\nmore substantial meal. The comic theatre is small, but much more perfect\r\nthan the one previously visited. In all the public buildings a\r\ncommencement of restoration after the earthquake was clearly visible,\r\nespecially in the forum.\r\n\r\n“Vegetation takes root, at every opportunity, between cracks of stones,\r\nor wherever mould is collected; grass there is none. The wild fig and\r\nthe luxuriant fern are the most frequent intruders, but they do not\r\nspread sufficiently to afford shelter, and the walls themselves are not\r\nhigh enough to serve as protection against the scorching sun. As the sun\r\nneared the horizon, we were warned to depart, and, mounting our car in\r\npreference to the railway, we rattled off along the high road, well\r\npleased with a journey that, after defraying all expenses, did not\r\nexceed the cost of 3_s._ 4_d._ So ended my first day at Pompeii, 1843.\r\n\r\n“I could not help contrasting all this with our first visit to\r\nHerculaneum, which is entirely underground, imbedded in hard tufa, and\r\nexposed only in small portions protruding here and there, where we\r\nthreaded long caverns and galleries cut in the wet, cold, and dripping\r\nmaterial, the bad vapours of which are very dangerous. I would compare\r\nHerculaneum to a geological fossil half worked out of the compact\r\nmaterial which surrounds it. There is an important difference in the\r\noverwhelming of the two cities. Pompeii was covered solely with fine\r\ndust and powdered scoria, all _dry_ but rendered compact by the great\r\npressure of the fallen mass. Herculaneum was filled up by a dense\r\nrolling liquid, or rather paste of fine powder mixed with boiling\r\n_water_ strongly impregnated with sulphur, and forming what has now\r\nbecome a perfectly hard compact stone, and only to be removed with the\r\naxe. In Pompeii all excavations are carried on with the shovel, as the\r\ndry powder easily gives way.”\r\n\r\nThe private houses of Pompeii have been variously named, sometimes from\r\nan inscription on the door post, or from the subject of some principal\r\npainting, at other times from the supposed occupation or condition of\r\nthe owner, or from a peculiar object found in the dwelling; and not\r\nunfrequently the presence of some distinguished person at the time of\r\nexcavation has conferred a lasting title on some particular remains. The\r\napplication of these names will be seen in the houses of Pansa, of\r\nMeleager, the Quæstor, the Surgeon, the Fountain, and that of Queen\r\nCaroline. Some of the houses have had the names changed, as that of the\r\nTragic Poet is now called the House with Homeric Paintings. All the\r\nhouses seem to have been buried somewhat higher than the top of the\r\nground floor. Upon this bed of ashes is found a layer of ashes mixed\r\nwith mould, and remains of buildings to the depth of seven feet. The\r\nmoisture retained in the vegetable mould had destroyed the surface of\r\nthe paintings, and not unfrequently the pattern was seen on the mould to\r\nwhich the stucco still adhered. In this manner has the decoration of the\r\nupper apartments been destroyed, and the pressure of superincumbent\r\nmasses has crumbled the woodwork. That the houses had upper ranges of\r\nchambers is evident from the remains of staircases leading to them both\r\nwithin and without. The first floors were nobly paved, mosaics having\r\nbeen found at various levels one above the other. Ceilings also were\r\nvariously decorated with paintings like the walls, and sometimes\r\ncomposed of stucco. Mr. Falkener (pp. 66 and 67) observed a gorgeously\r\nornamented ceiling to a tablinum. It consisted of a large circle in a\r\nsquare panel boldly moulded, and enriched with stucco ornament, with\r\nultramarine, vermilion, and purple colouring, together with a profusion\r\nof gilding. Fragments of equally elaborate ceilings were found in such a\r\nposition as to lead to the conviction that they belonged to apartments\r\nof different stories, one above the other.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Pompeii is generally struck with the intensity and\r\ncrudeness of the colours on the walls. This is easily accounted for in\r\nthe necessity for the exclusion of light in hot countries; for with\r\nlight heat comes also, and all who have visited Italy will remember the\r\ncare with which the modern sitting rooms are darkened during daytime.\r\nThe strength of these colours would thus be always _toned down_ by\r\nshade.[53] With all the variegation of colour in these Pompeian walls,\r\none pervading principle may be observed, viz., that the strongest and\r\ndarkest colours are confined to the bottom of the room. Thus if the\r\ndado, or lower part of the wall, be black, the rest will be red or\r\nyellow, and the ceiling white; and if the dado be red, the rest of the\r\nwall yellow or blue. If the dado be yellow, all the rest of the room\r\nwill be white.\r\n\r\n  [53] See page 65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARRANGEMENT OF A POMPEIAN HOUSE.\r\n\r\nPainted Garden. Peristyle. Fauces. Ala. Cubiculum. Tablinum. Impluvium.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF THE ATRIUM OF THE HOUSE OF THE TRAGIC POET, ACCORDING TO THE\r\nRESTORATION OF SIR WILLIAM GELL.]\r\n\r\nThe principal divisions of a Roman house consist of three square\r\nchambers, leading one into the other; the first and last of these are\r\nlighted by a square opening in the middle of the ceiling, but the\r\ncentral apartment is destitute of any means for the entrance of the\r\ndaylight; in fact, it receives only such light as can be communicated\r\nfrom the rooms on either side; still as there was no actual partition\r\nbetween these chambers, beyond that made by curtains,[54] sufficient\r\nlight must have obtained entrance, which could be modulated at pleasure.\r\nThe name of this central room was the _Tablinum_. The first room, which\r\nis generally the largest, is called the _Atrium_, and has a square tank\r\nor basin in the middle of the floor to collect the water dropping from\r\nthe roof, and to receive the falling rain, as the apartment is directly\r\nopen to the sky. The aperture in the roof is not very large, and this\r\narrangement for the free descent of rain affords two essential luxuries\r\nto the inhabitant of a southern climate--shade and moisture. In a\r\ncountry like our own it is scarcely possible to estimate their value.\r\n\r\n  [54] Sir William Gell (vol. i. p. 160 of Pompeiana, Second Series)\r\n  states that the iron rods on which curtains or draperies were\r\n  suspended from column to column were discovered perfect in an\r\n  excavation at Herculaneum in 1828.\r\n\r\nThe further room had a larger aperture above, and the open space below\r\nwas laid out with plants like a garden, bordered with columns, so that\r\nthe narrow covered space left on each side formed a miniature cloister.\r\nIt was called _Peristyle_, from the Greek words, meaning surrounded by\r\ncolumns. In the map of ancient Rome, made in the time of Septimius\r\nSeverus, this arrangement in the private houses is distinctly visible.\r\nAs in our modern houses, the proportions varied both according to the\r\ncaprice of the owner, or the limitations of space. Some had a greater\r\nnumber of apartments, and others a double set. Not a few added an\r\nextensive series of domestic offices, dining-rooms, and bed chambers,\r\nsome of them up stairs. Many houses had a second and third story of\r\nbed-rooms above the common level, but in all well constructed houses,\r\nwhatever the rank of the owner, these three apartments, _Atrium_,\r\n_Tablinum_, and _Peristyle_, remain the _essential_ portions. Here, as\r\nmuch of the life of a leading citizen was public, he received his\r\nclients and allowed the slaves to wait upon him. It was only in the\r\ninner apartment, such as the œci and triclinia, that he could indulge in\r\nprivacy.\r\n\r\nIn the better class of houses, the _Atrium_ was generally surrounded by\r\nsmaller rooms, called _cubicula_, and the square of the Atrium was\r\nbroken by the further part being widened on each side =[T]= fashion,\r\ninto _alæ_, or wings, which correspond to the transepts of our\r\ncathedrals. The _tablinum_, again, was narrowed by a partition which\r\ntook off a side passage, called _fauces_, through which the servants\r\npassed from one end of the house to the other without disturbing those\r\noccupied in the middle chamber. The floor of this _tablinum_ was\r\nfrequently ornamented with elegant pictures, in mosaic, as that of the\r\nTragic Poet’s House, by the choragus teaching his actors, and\r\ndistributing his masks (Gell, vol. i. pl. 45). The famous large mosaic,\r\nthe Battle of Issus, in the House of the Faun, has already been\r\nmentioned. In some houses, but very rarely, there was a passage on both\r\nsides of the tablinum; as in the reproduction described in these pages,\r\nthe House of the Coloured Capitals, and a few others, but the majority\r\nhave one only.\r\n\r\nThe reader may derive a clearer and certainly a more poetical idea of an\r\nancient house from the following extracts from Sir Bulwer Lytton’s “Last\r\nDays of Pompeii.” The house which he describes is taken from a personal\r\nexamination and the assistance of his antiquarian friend, Sir William\r\nGell:--\r\n\r\n“You enter then usually by a small entrance passage, called vestibulum,\r\ninto a hall sometimes with--but more frequently without--the ornament of\r\ncolumns; around three sides of this hall are doors communicating with\r\nseveral bedchambers--among which is the porter’s--the best of these\r\nbeing usually appropriated to country visitors. At the extremity of the\r\nhall on either side to the right and left, if the house is large, there\r\nare two small recesses, rather than chambers, generally devoted to the\r\nladies of the mansion; and in the centre of the tessellated pavement of\r\nthe hall is invariably a square shallow reservoir for rain\r\nwater--classically termed impluvium--which was admitted by an aperture\r\nin the roof above, the said aperture being covered at will by an awning.\r\nNear this impluvium, which had a peculiar sanctity in the eyes of the\r\nancients, were sometimes--but at Pompeii more rarely than at\r\nRome--placed images of the household gods. The hospitable hearth often\r\nmentioned by the Roman poets, and consecrated to the Lares, was at\r\nPompeii almost invariably formed by a moveable brazier; while in some\r\ncorner, often the most ostentatious place, was deposited a huge wooden\r\nchest, ornamented and strengthened by bands of bronze or iron, and\r\nsecured by strong hooks upon a stone pedestal, so firmly as to defy the\r\nattempts of any robber to detach it from its position. It is supposed\r\nthat this chest was the moneybox, or coffer, of the master of the house;\r\nthough as no money has been found in any of the chests discovered at\r\nPompeii, it is probable that it was sometimes rather designed for\r\nornament than use. In this hall--or atrium, to speak classically--the\r\nclients and visitors of inferior rank were usually received. In the\r\nhouses of the more ‘respectable,’ an atriensis, or slave peculiarly\r\ndevoted to the service of the hall, was invariably retained, and his\r\nrank among his fellow-slaves was high and important. The reservoir in\r\nthe centre must have been rather a dangerous ornament; but the centre of\r\nthe hall was like the grass plot of a college, and interdicted to the\r\npassers to and fro, who found ample space in the margin. Right opposite\r\nthe entrance at the other side of the hall, was an apartment (tablinum),\r\nin which the pavement was usually adorned with rich mosaics, and the\r\nwall covered with elaborate paintings. Here were usually kept the\r\nrecords of the family or those of any public office that had been filled\r\nby the owner; on one side of this saloon, if we may so call it, was\r\noften a dining-room or triclinium; on the other side, perhaps, what we\r\nshould now term a cabinet of gems, containing whatever curiosities were\r\ndeemed most rare and costly; and invariably a small passage for the\r\nslaves to cross to the further parts of the house without passing the\r\napartments thus mentioned. These rooms all opened on a square or oblong\r\ncolonnade, technically termed peristyle. If the house was small its\r\nboundary ceased with this colonnade, and in that case its centre,\r\nhowever diminutive, was ordinarily appropriated to the purpose of a\r\ngarden, and adorned with vases of flowers placed upon pedestals; while\r\nunder the colonnade, to the right and left, were doors admitting to\r\nbedrooms, to a second triclinium, or eating-room--for the ancients\r\ngenerally appropriated two rooms at least to that purpose, one for\r\nsummer and one for winter, or perhaps one for ordinary, the other for\r\nfestive occasions--and if the owner affected letters, a cabinet\r\ndignified by the name of library--for a very small room was sufficient\r\nto contain the few rolls of papyrus which the ancients deemed a notable\r\ncollection of books.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the peristyle was generally the kitchen. Supposing the\r\nhouse was large, it did not end with the peristyle, and the centre\r\nthereof was not, in that case, a garden, but might be perhaps adorned\r\nwith a fountain or basin for fish; and at its end, exactly opposite to\r\nthe tablinum, was generally another eating room, on either side of which\r\nwere bed rooms, and perhaps a picture saloon or pinacotheca. These\r\napartments communicated again with a square or oblong space, usually\r\nadorned on three sides with a colonnade like the peristyle, and very\r\nmuch resembling the peristyle, only usually longer. This was the proper\r\nviridarium or garden, being commonly adorned with a fountain or statues,\r\nand a profusion of gay flowers; at its extreme end was the\r\ngardener’s-house; on either side beneath the colonnade were sometimes,\r\nif the size of the family required it, additional rooms.\r\n\r\n“At Pompeii, a second or third story was rarely of importance, being\r\nbuilt only above a small part of the house and containing rooms for the\r\nslaves; differing in this respect from the more magnificent edifices of\r\nRome, which generally contained the principal eating-room (or cœnaculum)\r\non the second floor. The apartments themselves were ordinarily of small\r\nsize; for in those delightful climes they received any extraordinary\r\nnumber of visitors in the peristyle (or portico), the hall, or in the\r\ngarden; and even their banquet rooms, however elaborately adorned and\r\ncarefully selected in point of aspect, were of diminutive proportions;\r\nfor the intellectual ancients being fond of society, not of crowds,\r\nrarely feasted more than nine at a time, so that large dinner rooms were\r\nnot so necessary with them as with us. But the suite of rooms seen at\r\nonce from the entrance, must have had a very imposing effect: you beheld\r\nat once the hall richly paved and painted--the tablinum--the graceful\r\nperistyle, and if the house extended further, the opposite banquet-room,\r\nand the garden which closed the view with some gushing fount or marble\r\nstatue.\r\n\r\n“The reader will now have a tolerable notion of the Pompeian houses,\r\nwhich resembled in some respects the Grecian, but mostly the Roman\r\nfashion of domestic architecture. In almost every house there is some\r\ndifference in detail from the rest, but the principal outline is the\r\nsame in all. In all, you find the hall, the tablinum, and the peristyle,\r\ncommunicating with each other; in all you find the walls richly painted;\r\nand in all the evidence of a people fond of the refining elegances of\r\nlife. The purity of the taste of the Pompeians in decoration is,\r\nhowever, questionable; they were fond of the gaudiest colours, of\r\nfantastic designs; they often painted the lower half of their columns a\r\nbright red, leaving the rest uncoloured: and where the garden was small,\r\nits wall was frequently tinted to deceive the eye as to its extent,\r\nimitating trees, birds, temples, &c., in perspective; a meretricious\r\ndelusion which the graceful pedantry of Pliny himself adopted with a\r\ncomplacent pride in its ingenuity.”\r\n\r\nThe novelist then proceeds to describe the house known by the name of\r\nthe Tragic Poet. (See plan No. 2 on page 38.)\r\n\r\n“You enter by a long and narrow vestibule, on the floor of which is the\r\nimage of a dog in mosaic, with the well-known ‘Cave canem,’ or ‘Beware\r\nthe dog.’ On either side is a chamber of some size: for the interior\r\npart of the house not being large enough to contain the two great\r\ndivisions of private and public departments, these two rooms were set\r\napart for the reception of visitors who, neither by rank nor\r\nfamiliarity, were entitled to admission in the penetralia of the\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\n“Advancing up the vestibule, you enter an atrium that, when first\r\ndiscovered, was rich in paintings, which in point of expression would\r\nscarcely disgrace a Raphael. You may see them now transplanted to the\r\nNeapolitan Museum; they are still the admiration of connoisseurs--they\r\ndepict the parting of Achilles and Briseis.\r\n\r\n“Who does not acknowledge the force, the vigour, the beauty, employed in\r\ndelineating the forms and faces of Achilles and the immortal slave?\r\n\r\n“On one side of the atrium, a small staircase admitted to the apartments\r\nfor the slaves on the second floor; there also were two or three small\r\nbedrooms, the walls of which portrayed the Rape of Europa, the battle of\r\nthe Amazons, &c.\r\n\r\n“You now enter the tablinum, across which, at either end, hung rich\r\ndraperies of Tyrian purple, half withdrawn. On the walls was depicted a\r\npoet reading his verses to his friends; and in the pavement was inserted\r\na small and most exquisite mosaic, typical of the instructions given by\r\nthe director of the stage to his comedians.\r\n\r\n“You passed through the saloon, and entered the peristyle; and here, as\r\nI have said before was usually the case with smaller houses of Pompeii,\r\nthe mansion ended. From each of the seven columns that adorned this\r\ncourt hung festoons of garlands; the centre, supplying the place of a\r\ngarden, bloomed with the rarest flowers, placed in vases of white\r\nmarble, that were supported on pedestals. At the left hand of this small\r\ngarden was a diminutive fane, resembling one of those small chapels\r\nplaced at the sides of roads in Catholic countries, and dedicated to the\r\nPenates; before it stood a bronze tripod; to the left of the colonnade\r\nwere two small cubicula or bedrooms; to the right was the triclinium, in\r\nwhich the guests were now assembled.\r\n\r\n“This room is usually termed by the antiquaries of Naples, ‘The Chamber\r\nof Leda;’ and in the beautiful work of Sir William Gell, the reader will\r\nfind an engraving from that most delicate and graceful painting of Leda\r\npresenting her new-born to her husband, from which the room derives its\r\nname. This charming apartment opened upon the fragrant garden. Round the\r\ntable of citrean wood, highly polished and delicately wrought with\r\nsilver arabesques, were placed the three couches, which were yet more\r\ncommon at Pompeii than the semicircular seat that had grown lately into\r\nfashion at Rome; and on these couches of bronze, studded with richer\r\nmetals, were laid thick quiltings, covered with elaborate broidery, and\r\nyielding luxuriously to the pressure.”\r\n\r\nThe following plans, pp. 38 and 39, are collected into one group to\r\nafford a more easy view of the differences in their general\r\nconstruction. They are not drawn to scale, and have no pretensions to\r\ndetail. The principal apartments only are named upon them, and the\r\nfollowing is a list of their chief peculiarities, together with the\r\ndates when they were excavated, and the various names by which they have\r\nbeen known. The first numbers correspond with those on the plans.\r\n\r\n1. HOUSE OF THE EMPEROR JOSEPH II. (1767-69), was a mansion of great\r\nmagnificence, of three stories. It was beautifully situated on the side\r\ntowards the sea. This house had a suite of baths; and in the\r\nfurnace-room the skeleton of a female was discovered. The regularity of\r\nplan is very remarkable; but, unfortunately, the excavations were filled\r\nin again, so that nothing now remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n2. HOUSE OF THE TRAGIC POET (1824-26) is called in the Museo Borbonico,\r\n“_Casa Omerica_,” the Homeric House: the same which Bulwer describes as\r\nthe house of Glaucus. Remarkable for the beauty and dignified character\r\nof its paintings, most of them illustrating Homeric subjects.\r\n\r\nA list of a few of the principal paintings and mosaics in this house\r\nwill suffice to show the taste of its occupant.\r\n\r\n_Cave Canem._ Mosaic at entrance.\r\n\r\nIn atrium, on right wall, next to entrance, _The Marriage of Peleus and\r\nThetis_. On side wall, right hand, _The Parting of Achilles and\r\nBriseis_. On same wall, separated only by a door, _The Departure of\r\nChryseis_. Opposite to the parting of Achilles and Briseis was\r\nrepresented _The Fall of Icarus_. In a cubiculum on this side was the\r\nsmall frieze of _Battle of Amazons_ (copied in the Atrium of Pompeian\r\nCourt, page 47). The tablinum was adorned with a picture of _A Poet\r\nreading_, and the mosaic pavement representing _The Choragus and\r\nActors_. In a little chamber to the left of tablinum was a small picture\r\nof _Venus fishing_. At the end of ambulatory of peristyle near\r\ntriclinium was the famous picture of _The Sacrifice of Iphigenia_,\r\npainted on the wall adjoining the oven of the Fullonica. _The Deserted\r\nAriadne_ (page 57) adorned a small chamber to the left of the peristyle.\r\nThe opposite side of the peristyle was occupied by the kitchen, latrina,\r\nand triclinium, which latter contained the exquisite picture of _Leda\r\npresenting her Infant Progeny to Tyndareus_; hence this apartment is\r\nsometimes called the Chamber of Leda. Other pictures in the same room\r\nare _Venus_, _Cupid_, and _Adonis_, and an elaborate composition of\r\n_Theseus deserting Ariadne_. He is in the act of stepping on board a\r\nship, where sailors are making ready for departure. Ariadne lies asleep\r\non the shore; her head is surrounded with a blue circular glory, which\r\nis not uncommon in Pompeian paintings. Many of these pictures are on a\r\ncomparatively large scale, and only equalled in artistic excellence by\r\nthose which have been discovered in the houses of the Dioscuri and of\r\nCeres, one of the smallest houses in Pompeii. It has only one _ala_\r\n(plan given in Mus. Bor., vol. ii., tav. 55, and in Gell, vol. i., pl.\r\n35, p. 143).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. House of Joseph II.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. House of the Meleager or Apollo, and House of Nereids,\r\nor of Isis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. House of the Tragic Poet, or, House of the Homeric\r\nPaintings.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5.

HOUSE OF QUEEN CAROLINE (1813), now called that of Adonis, remarkable\r\nfor the width of Atrium when viewed from vestibule. The kitchen has\r\nwindows opening to the street. In an open court is a permanent\r\nsemicircular couch of stone, the _sigma_ of Martial, and so called from\r\nthe shape that the Greek letter had at this period acquired. (See notice\r\non the changes in the Greek alphabet, in the Catalogue of Greek Court,\r\np. 22). In the Atrium, plants were painted on the wall, as if sprung up\r\nout of the ground. A celebrated caricature painting of the studio of a\r\nportrait painter was discovered by Mazois in this house.\r\n\r\n4. HOUSE OF THE MELEAGER OR APOLLO (1830-31), called also the House of\r\nIsis, or of the Nereids. The house is very extensive, and the various\r\napartments are arranged in a different manner from what is generally\r\nseen at Pompeii. The block plan, No. 4, will sufficiently explain the\r\ndistribution of the various parts. The vestibulum is very long and\r\nnarrow.\r\n\r\n5. HOUSE OF SALLUST (1809). Known also as the House of Actæon. The\r\n_venereum_ is the peculiar feature of this house. The skeleton of a\r\nyoung female, with four rings on one of her fingers, was discovered as\r\nif just in the act of escaping; five gold bracelets, two ear-rings, and\r\nthirty-two pieces of money were lying near her. The skeletons of three\r\nother females, probably slaves, were found near her. The doorway of the\r\n_Prothyrum_ was very broad, and was closed with a _quadrivalve_ door,\r\nfolding back like our shutters.\r\n\r\n6. Two houses side by side, called from the features of their\r\nperistyles, the Greater and the Smaller Fountain (1826). The small\r\nfountain itself made of shells, the greater one encrusted with mosaics.\r\nIn the former house a remarkable painting of a sea-port, supposed to\r\nrepresent Dicæarchia, or Puteoli, was discovered. Two staircases\r\nindicate the former existence of upper rooms. Here they found oil, in\r\nvases, with olives still swimming in it.\r\n\r\n7. HOUSE OF THE COLOURED CAPITALS (1833-34). A very large house near the\r\nso-called Pantheon.\r\n\r\nIt is a magnificent specimen of arrangement and decoration. The long\r\nrange of colonnade, forming a second peristyle or decorated garden, is\r\npeculiar to this habitation. (Plan given in Mus. Bor., vol. x., tav. A &\r\nB.)\r\n\r\n8. HOUSE OF THE DIOSCURI (1828-29). This beautiful mansion has been\r\nknown by a great variety of names--_The Quaestor_, _the Centaur_,\r\n_Castor and Pollux_. The latter name (Dioscuri also) is derived from the\r\nspirited figures of the sons of _Leda_, painted reining in their horses\r\non the side walls of the left-hand vestibulum. A running _Mercury_, with\r\npurse in hand, was painted on one of the posts of the same entrance. The\r\nexterior of this house is much more carefully decorated than was usual\r\namong the Pompeians. Many of the stucco ornaments have been picked out\r\nwith colour. Highly-decorated wooden chests, lined and bound externally\r\nwith iron, were found in the atrium, at the entrance of the left-hand\r\nala, which still contained a few gold and silver coins that had escaped\r\nthe grasp of some one who had returned to the spot after the destruction\r\nof the city, and made excavation, evidently directed to that particular\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThis house is one of the finest for the grandeur and taste displayed in\r\nevery part of it. The celebrated paintings, _Perseus and Andromeda_,\r\n_Medea and her Children_, were found on the piers at the lower angles of\r\nthe great central Peristyle. The great Exedra, or Triclinium, at its\r\nextremity, was closed with folding doors, the sockets of which still\r\nremain, and the floor was decorated with the famous circular mosaic of\r\n_The Lion crowned with Garlands by young Cupids_. (Engraved in Mus.\r\nBor., vol. vii., tav. 61.) (Plan given in Gell’s Pompeiana, vol. ii.,\r\npl. 63.)\r\n\r\n9. HOUSE OF THE FEMALE MUSICIAN (1847). Known by the Italian name _Della\r\nSonatrice_, called likewise _House of the Triumphant Bacchus_. It is a\r\nvery interesting excavation, displaying much magnificence and elegance\r\nof decoration. It may be regarded as a double house of three stories.\r\nSeveral of the paintings of the Sydenham Court have been copied from the\r\nwalls of this mansion. The name of the house is derived from a painting\r\nin one of the chambers representing a young actress in a mask playing\r\nthe double flute. A picture was found near the foot of the stairs\r\ndisplaying writing materials, such as tablets, _stylus_, _atramentum_,\r\nor ink-bottle, and a sealed letter, which preserves the direction on it,\r\n“To the Decurion Marcus Lucretius.” Hence, the house is not unfrequently\r\ncalled by his name, in the supposition that he must have been the owner.\r\nMr. Falkener was present during the excavation of this house, and has\r\npublished a very interesting account of his observations in the Museum\r\nof Classical Antiquities. The arrangement of the portion beyond the\r\ntablinum is very singular, consisting of a fountain and basin surrounded\r\nby a variety of small figures arranged in front of it. The house seems,\r\nat the period of its destruction, to have been undergoing alteration.\r\nMany of the central pictures had been taken out from the walls,\r\npreparatory to the insertion of fresh ones. The artists appear to have\r\nsometimes painted on wood for that purpose. Many years ago, the workmen\r\ncame to an apartment at Stabiæ, where the pictures had been separated\r\nfrom a wall preparatory to removal, which the ruin of the city\r\nprevented: the paintings therefore were found leaning against the wall\r\nof the apartment. (The plan of this house is given in Mus. Bor., vol.\r\nxiv., tav. A and B.)\r\n\r\n10. PLAN of some private dwellings copied from the celebrated fragments\r\nof a map of Rome, engraved on marble about the time of Septimius\r\nSeverus. (Bellorius Ichnographia, Tab. 7, page 35.)\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF PANSA. (1811-14.) One of the largest of the superior class\r\nof mansions hitherto discovered. It has an extensive garden, and the\r\nrooms were distributed with great regularity. This house is more\r\ngenerally referred to in illustration of a Pompeian house, and for that\r\nreason has been made the subject of a larger and more elaborate plan\r\nthan the rest. In one of the bed-rooms, five female skeletons were\r\nfound, some of them with gold ear-rings. The name of the house is\r\nderived from the red letters PANSAM. ÆD. PARATVS. ROG. daubed upon the\r\ndoor-post. (The plan of this house is given large at the end of this\r\nbook.)\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF CERES (1827). Called also the House of Zephyrus and Flora,\r\nfrom an interesting painting of the _Marriage of Zephyrus and Flora_; it\r\nis also known as the House of the _Ship_ (Naviglio), which latter name\r\nis derived from a painting in one of the shops. Another name, also, is\r\nof the _Bacchantes_. The beautiful seated divinities, _Bacchus_ and\r\n_Ceres_, between the Tablinum and Alæ of this court, were copied from\r\nthis House of Ceres. A third sitting deity, _Jupiter_, with a round\r\nplate behind his head, like the _nimbus_ of saints in old pictures,\r\nbelonged to this series. It is remarkably dignified. (See Mus. Bor.,\r\nvol. vi., tav. 52.)\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF THE FAUN (1829-31). So called from the discovery of the\r\nbeautiful little Faun introduced in this court, copied in the original\r\nmaterial, bronze. This house is celebrated for its great mosaic,\r\nrepresenting _Alexander and Darius at the Battle of Issus_. The\r\napartments were very numerous and on a grand scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE POMPEIAN HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe original intention in constructing the Pompeian Court in the Crystal\r\nPalace was to appropriate it for purposes of refreshment. In furtherance\r\nof this plan, more especial attention would have been devoted to the\r\nmural decorations and the arrangements for public accommodation and\r\nconvenience. The nature and extent of the gigantic structure within\r\nwhich this court was to be erected, determined, in a great measure, the\r\nbreadth of space to be left open. A glance upwards will show the\r\nspectator how the supports of the galleries are arranged, and also the\r\nnecessity that exists for incorporating these within the walls of the\r\nsmaller erection. The refreshment chambers must necessarily have been\r\nmuch larger in extent than any of the rooms in the houses at Pompeii;\r\nthe general disposition of their chambers, however well suited they\r\nmight have been for the purposes of ancient life, were totally\r\ninadequate to the requirements of modern visitors; consequently this\r\nplan was abandoned, and the present Pompeian Court instituted in its\r\nstead.\r\n\r\nThe original design for this house was made by Mr. Digby Wyatt, at\r\nNaples; and, in conjunction with Mr. Owen Jones, his companion in the\r\ntour for the collection of works of art for the decoration of the\r\nCrystal Palace generally, he entered into arrangements on the spot with\r\nSignor Abbate, the official draughtsman to the King for the Pompeian\r\nexcavations, to come over to England the following spring, with cartoons\r\nand tracings, from Pompeii, in order to decorate the building, then to\r\nbe prepared for him, at Sydenham, with facsimiles of the different\r\npaintings at Pompeii selected by Mr. Wyatt for the decoration of the\r\nrespective rooms. The King of Naples granted permission to Signor Abbate\r\nfor the visit, and, accordingly, this distinguished artist arrived in\r\nEngland fully prepared to perform his task. Although the plan of\r\ndevoting the Pompeian Court to refreshment was meanwhile given up, the\r\nmeasurement of the walls that had been given to Signor Abbate for the\r\npreparation of his cartoons prevented any general change of design, and\r\nthe shortness of the period originally fixed for his stay in this\r\ncountry prevented any important alterations being undertaken. The\r\ndecorative painting of the Pompeian house was entirely under the\r\nmanagement of Signor Abbate, Mr. Parris. Jun. acting as his deputy. They\r\nhad thirty assistants, ten of whom were English. The principal figure\r\npainters were Mundici and Gow, and the names of the chief ornamentalists\r\nare Leslie, Luetyens, Wassner, Yahn, Munsch, Mœvius, and Meyer. The\r\nentire arrangement and building are due to Mr. Digby Wyatt, furthered by\r\nthe zeal and energy of Mr. Thomas Hayes, his deputy.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in the following description of the Court, that each\r\npart has been copied from some existing authority; and the few\r\nexceptions that do occur, in which originality was necessary, have been\r\ncarefully noted.\r\n\r\nSome of the leading works which contain illustrations of Pompeii, will\r\nbe found enumerated in the list of books at the end of the description\r\nof the Roman Court, and others of more immediate importance have been\r\nreferred to in the text when requisite.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE POMPEIAN HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe outer walls are supposed to be surrounded by the street, and the\r\nentire house forms what the Romans called an _insula_; that is, a\r\ndetached building. The tiling, more conspicuous from the gallery, has\r\nbeen faithfully copied from an ancient example, from the House of the\r\nFemale Musician. The roof of a house was found complete in April, 1853,\r\nwith the upper part of the ridge carefully guarded by cement. The\r\nprincipal entrance faces the nave; it is flanked by two pilasters, the\r\ncapitals of which are copied from the back entrance of a house excavated\r\nin 1834 (Mus. Bor., vol. x., tav. A, B), and from sketches taken on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe general proportions of the doorway are taken from the house of Pansa\r\n(Gell, Pompeiana, series i., pl. 34.); the grating, or lattice-work[55]\r\nover the door, is introduced upon the authority of Mr. Donaldson in his\r\nwork upon doorways. The external windows are devised to throw more light\r\ninto the chambers, and to afford a more ready means of looking into the\r\ninner recesses. This apparent innovation is authorised by the windows of\r\nthe Tragic Poet’s house which open upon the street, although much higher\r\nup, being raised more than six feet above the level of the\r\nfoot-pavement. They seem to have been closed by sliding shutters and\r\nwere sometimes glazed. Glass was much used at Pompeii both for drinking\r\nvessels and windows; sheets of glass have been found there, and a convex\r\nglass for a lamp remained in the wall, dividing two apartments in the\r\npublic baths near the forum. The front part of the entrance was called\r\n_Vestibulum_; the remaining part of the passage, _Prothyrum_, which\r\nlatter was bounded by a second door which closed in the _Atrium_. The\r\ndoor is quadrivalve, and the panelling is taken from the false door\r\npainted on the wall of the Chalcidicum near the statue of Eumachia\r\n(Gell, Pompeiana, 2nd series, page 21, plate 9).\r\n\r\n  [55] Called by Vitruvius _Hypaetrum_. Smith, s. v. Janua. p. 626.\r\n  Compare a latticed window in vol. i., p. 229 of “Pitture d’Ercolano.”\r\n\r\nThe inlaid marble on the threshhold, representing a dog, is found at the\r\nentrance to the House of the Tragic Poet (Mus. Bor., vol. ii., tav. 56).\r\nA similar device was painted at the entrance of Trimalchio’s house,\r\ndescribed by Petronius, who was alarmed at the first sight of the\r\nfurious animal at the full stretch of his chain so skilfully represented\r\nin the original mosaic (Petronius, Satyricon, ch. 29). The inscription\r\non both is the same, CAVE CANEM, which means “Beware of the dog.”\r\n\r\nThe _Prothyrum_[56] or _Ostium_, was the passage between the street door\r\n(_janua_), and the house door (_ostium_), and corresponds to our\r\nentrance hall; a small square room on one side was sometimes devoted to\r\nthe door-keeper or porter (_janitor_ or _ostiarius_). They were called\r\n_Cellæ Ostiariæ_.\r\n\r\n  [56] Rich, s. v.\r\n\r\nThe walls and ceilings of these side apartments are white, with a red\r\n_dado_, that is, the lower part of the wall, answering to our surbase.\r\nThe decoration of these rooms is imitated from the House of the Second\r\nFountain. The walls of the _Prothyrum_ itself are red, with a winged\r\nCupid in a panel on each side. They are from the House of the Dioscuri.\r\nThe _dado_ is black, the ceilings of these three apartments are white\r\nand slightly arched.\r\n\r\nMost of the ceilings in Pompeii were of this description, and composed\r\nof segmental vaults painted in fresco, like the walls beneath, only in\r\nlighter colours or more delicate and thinner patterns on a white ground.\r\nA small stucco cornice highly enriched with colour follows the lines of\r\nthe archivolt. In the Villa of Diomed are some flat ceilings, and other\r\nexamples have been published in the Pitture d’Ercolano.\r\n\r\n\r\nATRIUM.\r\n\r\nThe view of this spacious apartment at the moment of entrance is very\r\nimposing; the only difference between this and a real Pompeian house\r\nconsists in the greater diffusion of light, and the increased scale of\r\nthe apartment better suited to a palace in the capital of the Empire.\r\nFor the purpose of fully displaying the beauties of the mural\r\ndecorations, much more light has been admitted into this apartment than\r\nis usually found in the same division of the Pompeian houses. To this\r\nend, the central aperture, which ought to have been of the same size as\r\nthe reservoir below, has been considerably widened. Windows also have\r\nbeen introduced in order to give the spectator a better view of the\r\ndecorations within the side chambers. At a glance the eye recognises the\r\nvarious parts of the building previously described. In the centre below\r\nis the square basin to collect the water, called the _impluvium_, and\r\nthe corresponding aperture above would be the _compluvium_. At the\r\nfurther end, facing the entrance, a graceful female figure is seen\r\nplaying the lyre--these paintings will be described hereafter. In many\r\nhouses this extremity is painted sky blue, with shrubs and trees to\r\nimitate a distant garden--this was the case in the peristyle of the\r\nTragic Poet’s House (Gell, vol. i., p. 159), also in the Houses of the\r\nQuæstor and Actæon (Gell, pl. 20, page 175). The dark square central\r\npart forming as it were a frame to our view of the peristyle, is the\r\n_tablinum_, the side-passages are the _fauces_, and the smaller\r\napertures round the sides of the _Atrium_ will be recognised as\r\nconducting to the _cubicula_. Each of these apartments we propose to\r\nexamine minutely, after having taken a general view of the _Atrium_.\r\nThis important space in a Roman house was called also the _Cavum Ædium_,\r\nor _Cavædium_, as Pliny writes it. There were various kinds of _Atria_;\r\nthe simplest with no support in the centre--as this--called the _Atrium\r\nTuscanicum_. Where the roof was supported by four columns in the centre\r\nit was called _Tetrastylum_. If the columns surrounding the _impluvium_\r\nwere numerous, it was called _Corinthium_, and when, as rarely has been\r\nfound, no opening was left in the centre, the apartment was said to be\r\n_Testudinatum_. Sometimes a roof was so arranged as to throw off the\r\nwater outside, and then the term _displuviatum_ was employed.\r\n\r\nThe _Atrium_, as viewed from the door, is oblong, in a position reversed\r\nfrom that in which it is generally found in Pompeian houses: although an\r\nauthority for this arrangement exists in the House of Queen Caroline.\r\nThe _impluvium_ in the centre is of marble, and the exquisite small\r\nmarble statue of a faun, serving at the same time as a fountain, is\r\ncopied from the house called after the grand Duke of Tuscany. The floor\r\nis an excellent imitation of ancient mosaic work, executed by Messrs.\r\nMinton; the various patterns are taken from different Pompeian houses.\r\nMany of the floors at Pompeii exhibit some of the finest examples of\r\nmosaic work in which elaborate paintings with every variety of colour\r\nhave been produced. They are composed solely of small pieces of coloured\r\nstone or glass fitted closely together and highly polished. It is the\r\nmost durable of all methods of painting, and is generally set in a\r\nstrong bed of cement. The modern Romans practise this art with such\r\nsuccess, that a mosaic can scarcely be distinguished from a picture\r\ncarefully painted with the brush. Every altar-piece but one, now in St.\r\nPeters’, has been made by this process. The celebrated mosaic of the\r\nDoves drinking, described by Pliny, is now in the capitol at Rome, and\r\nmany descriptions of pictures executed in this mode are to be found in\r\nancient authors. This process must be carefully distinguished from\r\n_inlaying_, which the ancients also practised, and may be seen here in\r\nthe vestibules and some of the side chambers leading out of the\r\nperistyle.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing colour of the atrium is white. All round the doors and\r\nthe windows of the Cubicula the wall is painted bright blue with red\r\ndado. The pilasters are white with the lower part yellow; their capitals\r\nwhite heightened by blue and red; they are from the House of the\r\nCentaur. In square compartments, on a white ground, between the capitals\r\nof pilasters, are elegant groups of female figures on marine animals,\r\nand Cupids in chariots; some of the small enriched mouldings are from\r\nthe cornice of the tomb of Calventius Quietus, and the atrium frieze\r\n_above tablinum_ is copied from a side apartment in the Tragic Poet’s\r\nHouse (Mus. Bor. vol. ii., tav. A). It is composed of white figures of\r\ncombatants in armour on foot and in chariots; shields and dead bodies\r\nlie prostrate. The ground of this frieze is purple, but the ground of\r\nthe original is described as white, and the figures are said to be\r\nclothed in blue, green, and purple draperies. The females are Amazons,\r\ndistinguished by the pelta or lunated shield (see Statue No. 194 of the\r\nGreek Court.) The rest of the frieze is white, with patterns of\r\nbright-coloured lines in simple forms. Over each pilaster the frieze is\r\nbroken by double figures of Victory, yellow and gold, which serve to\r\nsupport the beams which project to the edge of the compluvium. They were\r\nmodelled by Mr. Monti, under the superintendence of Signor Abbate, from\r\na drawing by Mr. Wyatt.\r\n\r\nThe compluvium is bordered with red standing tiles called antifixa, and\r\nthe arrangement of Mazois in his restoration of the House of Diomed has\r\nbeen followed. The antifixa may be seen also on the model of the\r\nParthenon in the bas-relief gallery adjoining the Greek Court. The angle\r\ntiles, with a spout to discharge the rain water, merit attention. The\r\nsloping roof of the atrium, composed of light beams with panelling\r\nbetween them, has been chiefly restored from existing paintings; but few\r\ntraces of woodwork remain in any part of these ancient cities without\r\nhaving been seriously disturbed; the atrium ceilings being of wood, were\r\nconsequently destroyed; pictorial records are therefore our only\r\nauthorities. Fortunately for us, the ancients seem to have delighted in\r\ndepicting themselves and their ways of living, so that it is not\r\nimprobable that the architectural specimens that we see on their walls\r\nare only the transcripts of the slender constructions which were in fact\r\nconfined to the upper stories. This is the more probable as the\r\nbackground of these architectural scenes is generally sky, and where\r\nvegetation does appear among them it consists commonly of plants growing\r\nin pots, or else the tops of trees as they would appear from the upper\r\npart of a house.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBICULA.\r\n\r\nWe must now go into the detail of the house and pass into each room as\r\nconsecutively numbered in the plan, beginning in this instance on the\r\nleft hand of the principal entrance, keeping the wall of Atrium always\r\nto the left.\r\n\r\n1. CUBICULUM. This small chamber has the walls totally black with a\r\nwhite ceiling. It is an exact copy both in size and decoration, of a\r\nroom in the House of the Bronzes at Pompeii, called _la stanza nera_.\r\nFacing the door is a square picture representing a “Sacrifice to\r\nMinerva” (engraved in Mus. Bor., vol. xiii., tav. 8). In the centre a\r\nround shield--the Argolic buckler--with serpent painted on it, mounted\r\non a square pedestal; above this appears a helmet placed on the top of a\r\nsquare pillar; a winged Cupid seems to be adjusting the shield; in front\r\nof the pedestal is a smaller circular altar, and Psyche with butterfly\r\nwings, clothed in yellow and pink, stands on the left, as if about to\r\ncast incense upon the altar. On the other side a Cupid, with blue wings\r\nof the same peculiar curve observable in the Marlborough gem,\r\nrepresenting the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche, brings a white lamb to\r\nthe altar for sacrifice. Among the arabesques to the right and left of\r\nthis picture are graceful vases. Half doors of a light wooden\r\nconstruction may be observed, and a curious method of displaying\r\npictures is shown here; they are represented upon the wall very much\r\nsloped forward and with folding shutters to them. (See Malkin’s Pompeii,\r\nvol. ii., p. 123.) The arabesques at each end of this cubiculum are\r\nespecially beautiful. They have been wonderfully copied in Gruner’s\r\nspecimens of Ornamental Art, the size of the originals. The effect of\r\ntheir rich colours upon a perfectly black ground is remarkable,\r\ncontributing to increase the apparent size of the room very\r\nconsiderably. Few at first sight would imagine this little apartment to\r\nmeasure only 22 feet 9 inches by 6 feet 9 inches. The window openings to\r\nthe atrium have been explained at page 44.\r\n\r\n2. CUBICULUM. The next chamber, forming one corner of the quadrangle,\r\nand lighted by a window in the outer wall, has also a white coved\r\nceiling. The upper part of the walls is white, the dado black, and the\r\nremaining interval blue. Three graceful female figures floating in\r\nseparate panels are Bacchantes; they have no wings. The picture\r\nsurrounded by blue opposite the door, represents a sitting Endymion; he\r\nholds a branch in his right hand, and a staff leaning on his left\r\nshoulder; the drapery is pink; at his feet a stag,[57] with horns and\r\nblue collar, may be regarded as the emblem of Diana, whose favourite he\r\nwas. (See Greek Court, No. 33). The background is composed of rocks with\r\na square tower in the centre. The subject of Endymion was a very\r\nfavourite one among the Pompeians. He was sometimes represented, as\r\nhere, entranced awaiting the arrival of the goddess, at other times\r\nsleeping, and the goddess gazing upon him, with his dog starting in\r\nsurprise at the visitor. Not unfrequently a Cupid is introduced leading\r\nDiana by the hand, holding a whip, as if she had just descended from her\r\nchariot of night. Whenever the goddess is present Endymion is always\r\nrepresented asleep. On the wall next the door facing the other picture\r\nis a square painting of Venus fishing. She sits on a rock on the right\r\nhand side, her yellow hair bound with a myrtle wreath, the lower part of\r\nher figure enveloped in green drapery; a fish has attached itself to the\r\nline of the rod which she holds in her right hand, and Cupid with blue\r\nwings, sitting on a rock across the water, expresses great joy at his\r\nmother’s success, which is evinced by his lively action. A piece of red\r\ndrapery upon which he kneels adds greatly to the harmony of the picture.\r\nThis subject of Venus angling is also frequently repeated; sometimes\r\nCupid holds the fish basket, and in other cases he angles also. (See\r\ncubiculum 15.)\r\n\r\n  [57] On a closer examination I perceive that the animal is wounded,\r\n  and the picture therefore represents Cyparissus, who killed a\r\n  favourite stag by accident, and was transformed into the cypress. The\r\n  picture is mentioned by Mr. Falkener (page 51).\r\n\r\n3. CUBICULUM. The next room in order flanks a side entrance. It is white\r\nwith a yellow dado. The wall facing the atrium has a square picture of a\r\npoet or bookseller, and a comedian. On each side of this picture are\r\npainted tall, thin, yellow columns, with yellow shields suspended\r\nbetween them. Medusa and Lion heads are in the centre of these shields,\r\nas they were found in the house described by Mr. Falkener (p. 46). The\r\npoet, in the picture opposite the door, sits on the left, with his legs\r\ncrossed. His head is crowned with ivy, and the lower part of his figure\r\nwrapt in blue and red drapery. He holds an open scroll in his left hand,\r\nand with his right seems to be giving instructions to the player, who\r\nstands before him with his mask raised over his head, as may also be\r\nseen in the mosaic from the tablinum of the Tragic Poet’s house. (Gell,\r\nPompeiana, pl. 45, vol. i. p. 174). The comedian is dressed in a purple\r\ntunic with sleeves, and a full yellow mantle like a pallium thrown over\r\nit. In his left hand he holds a _lituus_ or curved stick much used by\r\nthe players. It resembles the crooked staff borne by the augurs, and so\r\noften seen upon gems, Roman coins, and Etruscan paintings. It was\r\ngenerally carried by actors. (Wieseler, Theatergebaüde, &c. Pl. 11, No.\r\n3, Pl. 12, Nos. 23 to 28; and Pitture d’Ercolano, vol. ii. tav. 3. p.\r\n19). The lituus was curved more than the pedum or shepherd’s crook,\r\nwhich is simply a stick with a hook at the end of it.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the sitting figure is a round box called _capsa_ or\r\n_scrinium_, it has rings and cords on the outside. This box is, in fact,\r\na library, it contains the volumes or rolls such as have been discovered\r\nin the villa at Herculaneum (see _ante_, p. 20), one of which the poet\r\nmay be supposed to have taken out and to be holding in his hand. Many\r\ninstances of these _scrinia_ occur among the Pompeian paintings, with\r\ntickets or titles of the books hanging out at the top. (See also a\r\nstatue of Sophocles, No. 322, where the _scrinium_ is open and the rolls\r\nclearly displayed.)\r\n\r\nAbove this composition, is a landscape in an oblong frame. It contains a\r\nlong villa and trees with awnings extended for shade, a yellow isolated\r\ncolumn and a separate ædiculum. This is one of the examples of landscape\r\npainting prevalent during the time between Nero and Titus. Landscape\r\npainting did not at first become a separate branch of art but Ludius\r\nappears to have introduced the style. The ancients rarely indulged in\r\nthe modern taste for representing wild and romantic scenery; all their\r\ncompositions are made of long lines of building, basilicas, villas,\r\ntrees pleasantly disposed, bird’s-eye views of sea ports and\r\nartificially arranged gardens. Places in fact _to go to_ and not in\r\naccordance with the feeling of our own times, which leads us to enjoy a\r\ngrand scene, a combination of earth and sky without any desire to move\r\nfrom the spot upon which we have been placed. A description of the Vale\r\nof Tempe in Ælian has always been referred to as implying that the\r\nancients had _some_ feeling for the picturesque, and surely the back\r\ngrounds to many of their figures show considerable invention and\r\nromantic appreciation, although deficient in the modern arts of aërial\r\nperspective and chiaroscuro. Above this landscape, is a female figure,\r\nthe lower part draped, with an elephant’s trunk on the head, and a lion\r\nat her right side. In this manner Africa is personified on coins both of\r\nHadrian and Septimius Severus, (Millin, Gal. Myth., Nos. 371 and\r\n372).[58] The left foot of this figure is placed on an elephant’s head,\r\nof which the trunk and tusks only appear (compare Falkener, page 52,\r\nnote). The yellow dado is ormented with white swans, holding purple\r\nribands. On the left wall, opposite the side vestibule, is a pretty\r\nlittle group of a winged Cupid leading an ibex or chamois, painted on a\r\nvery dark purple ground.\r\n\r\n  [58] The skin with trunk and tusks of an elephant’s head may be seen\r\n  applied in a similar manner upon the coins of the Bactrian Demetrius.\r\n  Compare also a small double Hermes in the Roman Gallery, No. 385.\r\n\r\n4. VESTIBULUM. The side entrance, light and narrow. The ceiling consists\r\nof one flat sunk panel, white, with blue and red stars. The lower part\r\nof wall red, the dado black. The SALVE inlaid in the pavement is taken\r\nfrom the house of the Vestals.\r\n\r\n5. The ALA: here, of necessity, very shallow, but in many Pompeian\r\nhouses of much greater depth, has a white curved ceiling, with broad\r\nblue, red, and green lines on it. The upper part of walls white, a\r\nfrieze of black below it, yellow panels with white borders, black dado.\r\n\r\nThe paintings of the Ala have been taken from a house near the Basilica.\r\nThe great picture is called Cupid Condemned to Labour. The height of the\r\nmountain in the background is very remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe picture is surrounded with red, and flanked with white columns,\r\nhaving bright patterns spirally arranged upon them. On either side of\r\nthe chief picture are two floating figures upon a yellow ground,\r\nsurrounded by a chaste white patterned border, that has been published\r\nby Zahn. To the left are two Cupids bearing a square pharetra or quiver.\r\nTo the right a lovely Cupid with crimson drapery, carrying a lyre such\r\nas Apollo sometimes plays; he is assisted in the operation by a Psyche\r\nwith purple butterfly wings, a purple undervest and green over it,\r\nwearing pale blue boots. These little figures are copied from a house\r\nnear the forum. In the spandril is an architectural scroll-work in gay\r\ncolours, with two lions leaping through it, a peculiarity to be seen in\r\nthe Temple of Isis, at Pompeii, and in the Theatre of Myra, in Lycia.\r\n\r\n6. The wall adjoining the Ala, and forming part of the Atrium, has been\r\nvery gracefully decorated. It is occupied by a highly finished picture\r\nof Bacchus enthroned. The god of wine in the bloom of youth and beauty\r\nis crowned with the vine; a fawn’s skin--the nebris--is tied across his\r\nchest; in his right hand he holds the cantharus--a two-handled cup\r\nsacred to Bacchus--and with the other he grasps the thyrsus. His\r\nsandalled feet rest on a square foot-stool, and a leopard sits on the\r\nground to the right of the throne; a drum or tympanum is placed at the\r\nopposite side. The main ground of this composition is blue, the\r\narchitecture of the shrine or canopy around the figure green,\r\nyellowish-brown and red. The central group is engraved in the Mus. Bor.,\r\nvol. vi., tav. 53. The dado coloured rich deep red. From the House of\r\nCeres.\r\n\r\n7. Next to this is the left-hand FAUCES or passage to the interior, and\r\nmore private parts of the house. The white ceiling is delicately covered\r\nand spangled with blue and red stars. The right side of the fauces is\r\nwhite at the top, with alternate divisions below of red and blue having\r\narabesques upon them. The dado black, with green and yellow patterns\r\nupon them, published by Zahn.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE TABLINUM.\r\n\r\nThis broad central space, both as regards its dimensions and\r\ndecorations, is wholly copied from the Tablinum of the house of Apollo.\r\nThe entire upper part is white, with delicate lines of blight colours\r\nforming elegant patterns upon it. In the centre of the ceiling, which is\r\ngently curved, is a naked Venus upon a green hippocamp or sea monster. A\r\nflying Cupid holds reins, and another flying Cupid holds a mirror with a\r\nlong handle. Mus. Bor., vol. viii., tav. 10. Pitture d’Ercalano, vol.\r\nii., p. 247. The ground of the original group, found at Herculaneum, is\r\nblack. The Museo Borbonico text describes the second Cupid as holding\r\nan umbrella, but the form is peculiarly that of a mirror, and\r\nAppuleius, Met. 4, in his account of the train attending Venus as she\r\nproceeded to the palace of Oceanus, makes especial mention of one\r\nholding a mirror. The passage is so illustrative of the ideas of the age\r\nthat produced these paintings, that some part of it may be transcribed\r\nwith advantage.\r\n\r\n“The daughters of Nereus, too, were present singing in tuneful harmony;\r\nPortunus, too, rough with his azure-coloured beard; and Salacia, weighed\r\ndown with her lapful of fish; with little Palaemon, their charioteer,\r\nupon a dolphin, and then troops of Tritons furrowing the main in all\r\ndirections. One softly sounded his melodious shell; another with a\r\nsilken canopy protected her from the sun; a third held a mirror, while\r\nothers, again, swam yoked to her car.”\r\n\r\nThe spandrils formed by the architrave of the peristyle and atrium are\r\nfilled with green marine animals on white ground.\r\n\r\n9. _Left Wall._--The chief central picture is Perseus showing the head\r\nof Medusa to Andromeda, reflected in the water at their feet; as the\r\ndirect sight of the Gorgon’s visage turned all to stone, the conceit\r\nhere adopted is very pretty. It was popular in Pompeii, and frequently\r\nrepeated. When Perseus was about to encounter Medusa, Minerva gave him a\r\npolished shield, by the assistance of which he cut off her head without\r\nthe peril that had attended so many others, being guided through his\r\nenterprise by the reflection in the shield. The composition of this\r\npicture is very elegant. It is surrounded by bright red. On both sides\r\nof the centre are rich architectural ranges of columns in two tiers. The\r\ncoffered ceilings represented are worthy of observation. Before the\r\ncolumns, at the lower part, are bright blue doorways, in which lie comic\r\nmasks. To the right and left of these central compartments are large\r\nyellow panels, each containing a floating female figure without wings.\r\nThe one to the left holds a pedum in her right hand and a vintage basket\r\nwith fruit in the left. The drapery is blue lined with purple. The\r\nfemale to the right, dressed in white and crimson edged with blue, has\r\nbare feet and holds a lyre and plectrum; both these females have\r\nbracelets. Between the masks, under the principal picture, is a black\r\nfrieze with admirably-painted greenish marine monsters. The dado of\r\nthese walls is black. The picture and Bacchantes are copied from the\r\nHouse with the Coloured Capitals.\r\n\r\n10. _Right Wall._--The opposite side has exactly the same decorations,\r\nwith the exception of the central picture and the two side figures. The\r\nmiddle picture represents Venus (Aphroditê), Euploia, borne on the back\r\nof a Triton, playing a lyre. She is attended by the Cupids Pothos,\r\nHimeros, and Eros. A female figure behind carries a jar, and the heads\r\nof Boreas and Zephyros blowing are visible through the dark blue sky.\r\nThis picture is taken from the house with the coloured capitals. It has\r\nbeen carefully engraved in the Museo Borbonico, vol. xii., tav. 32. See\r\nalso Panofka Autikenschau, Berlin, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe floating female to the left of central picture holds the _tympanum_\r\nor drum in the right and _thyrsus_ in the left; her dress is pale purple\r\nwith white drapery floating behind. This shows well on the yellow panel.\r\nHer left breast is covered with a nebris or fawn-skin. The female to the\r\nright holds a ewer in her right hand and a patera in her left. A thin\r\ngauze drapery is next her skin, having a crimson drapery lined with blue\r\nover it. Both these Bacchantes have bracelets and anklets. The four\r\nfloating Bacchantes of tablinum have been taken from the House with the\r\nColoured Capitals.\r\n\r\n11. The second FAUCES is precisely like the other. The broad black line\r\nin the pavement edging the floor is characteristic of a Pompeian house.\r\nIn the one described by Mr. Falkener the black margin, about nine inches\r\nbroad (page 39), joined the walls. In some instances the colour was red.\r\n\r\n12. Wall corresponding in position and decoration to No. 6. The central\r\nfigure here enthroned is Ceres, the Demeter of the Greeks. The Goddess\r\nof Corn, of Earth, and Agriculture, is crowned with corn. A torch in her\r\nright hand, bearded corn on her left arm, and a basket of corn also at\r\nher feet. The spiked corn is always seen represented in ancient art both\r\nin paintings and on coins. It forms a conspicuous symbol on the coins of\r\nMetapontum, a city in the same part of Italy as Pompeii. This painting\r\nis engraved in the Mus. Bor., vol. vi., tav. 54. Also by Zahn, taf. 25.\r\nThe figure of Ceres is dressed in thin gauze undergarment, with pale\r\nslate-coloured drapery covering a purple dress, which appears only above\r\nthe feet. A muslin-like drapery is gathered behind her head and\r\nshoulders. The throne, torch, and flame are all of one uniform yellow\r\ncolour. The basket of corn is in natural colours. From the House of\r\nCeres.\r\n\r\n13. ALA. The general decoration of Ala corresponds with the opposite\r\none. The main central picture of this Ala represents the rescue of\r\nAndromeda. This painting affords an interesting comparison with the\r\nbas-relief in the Greek Court, No. 35, where the same subject is\r\nrepresented. The treatment of the principal figures in the painting is\r\nmuch more sculpturesque than in the bas-relief. In the former the\r\nrescued lady stands attitudinizing on a rock, like a statue on a\r\npedestal; her drapery is unruffled, and there is no sign of emotion in\r\nthe figure prompted either by love, or the recollection of her recent\r\nperilous situation. In the latter there is a wild flutter about the\r\ndrapery of Andromeda. She is descending from the rock with an evident\r\nconfidence and dependence on her deliverer; and his firm manly pose in\r\nthe sculpture is characteristic of the hero. The freedom, however, in\r\nthe lines, is more pictorial in the bas-relief. The group as exhibited\r\nin our Pompeian picture, is excellently adapted for modelling in\r\nisolated statues. Compare Mus. Bor., vol. vi., tav. 50.\r\n\r\nIn this picture Perseus has yellow sandals and blue talaria. The action\r\nof the hand to conceal the Gorgon’s head is not so successful as in the\r\nsculpture; it is offensive to the spectator to see that openly which is\r\nsupposed to carry so much horror with it. On the ground, at the feet of\r\nAndromeda, is a yellow casket, a white fan with red handle, and several\r\nwhite cockle shells, scattered on the ground, which give an appearance\r\nof petty detail. Two females are sitting on the rocks to the left, and\r\nseem to be gazing upon the vanquished monster rolling at the feet of\r\nAndromeda. The sword which Perseus bears is worth notice. It is the\r\n_falx_, and has a peculiar hook to it used for pruning. The falx and\r\ntalaria or heel wings, are characteristic of Perseus. The graceful\r\nfigures on each side of this central picture are from a house near the\r\nforum. To the left, a Cupid, with purple drapery, is supporting a\r\npale-blue vase. Psyche, with purple butterfly wings and blue and green\r\ndrapery, soars above, and seems helping to lift the vase by the handles.\r\nIt forms a charming group. To the right of the chief picture are two\r\nCupids carrying a basket with double arched handle. Both these groups\r\nare on a yellow ground.\r\n\r\n14. VESTIBULUM, exactly the same as the one opposite.\r\n\r\n15. CUBICULUM or _cella familiaris_ as next the vestibule. This chamber\r\nhas white walls with yellow dado. The central picture facing Atrium\r\nrepresents Venus fishing; she holds the rod in the right hand, and, as\r\nusual, leans with the other hand on the seat, having the arm quite\r\nstraight. A similar subject has already been described in cubiculum 2.\r\nHere the figures are larger and close together. Instead of Cupid, is a\r\nGenius,[59] with broad-spreading green wings. He holds a green branch\r\nin his right hand; his drapery purple. Venus is crowned with a diadem,\r\nwhite drapery hangs behind her left arm, and the lower part of her\r\nfigure is covered by crimson folds with blue lining. The arrangement of\r\nsloping shields on each side is the same as in chamber 3. Above the\r\nchief painting is a landscape, with buildings, water and a boat. Over\r\nthis little picture again is a Victory in a _biga_ or chariot, with the\r\nhorses painted entirely in yellow. The figure of Victory holds the palm\r\nbranch in her left, and extends the right arm, grasping a wreath. Her\r\nwings are wide spread, but very much distorted. When Cupid was banished\r\nfrom Olympus for his impertinence, it is said that his wings were taken\r\nfrom him and transferred to Victory. In early art many of the divinities\r\nwere winged. Diana on the chest of Cypselus (Pausanias, book v., ch.\r\n19,) and so also is she represented upon the celebrated Clitias vase, at\r\nFlorence. Many of the large figures of the Assyrian palaces, evidently\r\nacting as priests or attendants, are provided with wings, but they are\r\nnever seen using them. Hebe is represented winged upon the famous cup of\r\nSosias at Berlin, but these all belong to the undeveloped period of art.\r\nAmong the Athenians Victory was represented unwinged--_Apteros_. After\r\nthe battle of Marathon, Minerva is fabled to have confined Victory to\r\nher favourite spot, the Acropolis, by depriving her of her wings. A\r\ncelebrated wooden statue of Wingless Victory, _Niké Apteros_, was at\r\nAthens, and a copy of it made by Calamis was sent to Olympia by the\r\nMantineans. At Athens was the celebrated little temple of Wingless\r\nVictory, some of the sculptures from which are described in No. 57 of\r\nGreek Court catalogue. The right hand of the great ivory statue by\r\nPhidias, in the Parthenon, held a figure of Victory, Greek Court\r\ncatalogue, pp. 29 and 30. To return to the painted Victory in this\r\napartment. The highly decorated bar which seems attached to the collars\r\nof the horses is very peculiar. The gathering of the mane into a knot on\r\nthe heads of the horses, and their breast collars are exactly like those\r\non the carved lid of the Chimæra tomb from Xanthus, now in the British\r\nMuseum. The top knot of the horses may be seen in several antique\r\nsculptures from Naples and Florence, Nos. 69 and 71 of Greek Catalogue,\r\nand seems to have been originally an eastern custom. The body of the\r\nchariot is quite plain. The horses viewed in front are very clumsily\r\nforeshortened. This group has been engraved in Mus. Bor., vol. xiv.,\r\ntav. 45. On the light hand wall is a little compartment of a winged\r\nCupid, with pedum and basket, running from a sitting lion. These\r\npaintings are all from the House of the Girl playing the Double-flute,\r\ncalled della Sonatrice, discovered in 1847 (H.B. p. 353).\r\n\r\n  [59] Called in Mr. Falkener’s book, p. 49, Victory.\r\n\r\n16. CUBICULUM, occupying the corresponding angle to No. 2, also lighted\r\nwith a window, is blue with black dado; copied from the House of the\r\nSecond Fountain. The chief picture on the wall opposite the door is the\r\ndeserted Ariadne, a subject many times repeated at Pompeii, and with a\r\ngreat variety of treatment. Ariadne is represented sitting on the shore\r\nof Naxos just awaking, and beginning to be aware of her forlorn\r\nsituation; Cupid, at her side, points to a ship far away, with\r\nfull-spread sail and many oars, which is bearing off Theseus, her\r\nfaithless lover. A crimson cord, for necklace, is crossed also over her\r\nnaked body, a purple drapery covers her lower limbs. The scene is\r\nindicated by wild crags, and the horizon is placed remarkably high up in\r\nthe picture. The wings of Cupid are green, the ship yellow with a white\r\nsail. This picture is copied from one in the House of the Tragic Poet;\r\nit has been engraved in the Mus. Bor., vol. ii., tav. 62., and Zahn,\r\nvol. i., pl. 33. Gell’s Pompeiana, vol. i., pl. 43, page 169.\r\n\r\nOn each side is a graceful floating female figure, the one to the left\r\nholding a patera in one hand, and a garland in the other; the female on\r\nthe other side, has a similar action, her drapery is yellow: both\r\nfigures are remarkably elegant. On the opposite wall, next the door, is\r\na picture of a very playful character; it is a Cupid seller. On the\r\nground is a square strongly constructed cage, such as is used for birds,\r\nwith an opening at the top, through which an old man is in the act of\r\nlifting out a Cupid; other Cupids are within the bars, and show by their\r\ngestures the irksomeness of their confinement. The old man dressed in\r\nthe _exomis_, a garment peculiar to the working classes, lifts the\r\nstruggling Cupid by one wing; he holds the square trap door in his left\r\nhand; a handsome lady who has come as a purchaser stands on the other\r\nside and looks up to a Cupid flying above, holding two bright stars; her\r\nright hand seems to point to the cage from which the object of her\r\nattention may have escaped. Another Cupid has eluded the vigilance of\r\nhis keeper and hides himself behind the lady’s dress. The scene takes\r\nplace in a handsome portico with two Ionic columns. This has been\r\nengraved in Zahn, 2nd series, taf. 18. Another picture, found at Stabiæ,\r\nof a female Love merchant is much more pleasingly and better composed.\r\nThere the woman holds up the victim by both wings, and offers it like a\r\nlive chicken to a lady who is seated on the other side. Another Cupid\r\nremains within the cage, which is elegantly made and circular. This\r\nwell-known picture is engraved in the Pitt. Erc., vol. iii., tav. 7.,\r\nand Mus. Bor., vol. i., tav. 3. To the left of the picture on this wall\r\nis a beautiful floating female figure, holding a _tympanum_ or drum in\r\nthe right hand, with the other raised holding a _thyrsus_. A _nebris_,\r\nor fawn-skin, passes over her right shoulder, her drapery is red lined\r\nwith white, feet bare. The effect of colour upon the blue ground is very\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\n17. CUBICULUM. A black chamber, corresponding to the one we first\r\nentered. This room has been copied, both in style and decoration, from\r\nthe _stanza nera_ of the House of the Bronzes. Opposite the window is a\r\npleasing group of Cupid and Psyche, her drapery is purple and blue, and\r\nthe wings purple. The picture opposite door represents three Cupids and\r\nPsyche surrounding a peacock. In this bird we recognise the favourite of\r\nJuno, and the Cupids appear to be feeding it, but the meaning of the\r\nsubject is very vague. It has been engraved in the Mus. Bor., vol. xi.,\r\ntav. 15. Thus we have completed the circuit of the atrium and its\r\nsmaller chambers; we propose to pass into the less public parts of the\r\nhouse by the left hand fauces, No. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERISTYLE.\r\n\r\n18. _Ambulatory, Ambulatio_, also called _Porticus_ by the Romans, and\r\n_Stoa_ by the Greeks, is a colonnade on four sides, very like the\r\ncloisters of our cathedrals. The view looking through the fauces is\r\nbounded by a small shrine or chapel, called the _Lararium_. It is a\r\nniche raised on a pedestal, flanked by pilasters, and surmounted by a\r\npediment. Within this were kept the Lares, the sacred household gods,\r\nthat accompanied the inhabitants in their flight. No figures of this\r\nsort have ever been found in such places at Pompeii, although many\r\nrepresentations of them remain depicted on the walls. They were\r\ngenerally represented as young men in short girt tunics, crowned and\r\nholding the drinking horn in one hand. (See Milman’s Horace, p. 168.)\r\nTheir appearance was first ascertained by an inscription over the\r\nsculpture of an altar formerly in the Villa Medici, and now at Florence;\r\na similar altar is in the Vatican, both inscribed LARIBVS AVGVSTIS. (See\r\nGalleria di Firenze, pl. 144 of statue, &c.; Mus. Pio. Clem., vol. iv.,\r\ntav. 45; and Guattani Mon. Ined, vol. ii.; Maggio, 1785). The Lares\r\npresided especially over the domestic hearth. The cornice and\r\nentablature of Lararium are taken from the funeral Triclinium at\r\nPompeii. The wall behind is a rich Pompeian red, with a yellow ornament,\r\nforming a panel on it, beautifully painted.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the ambulatory is panelled and decorated according to the\r\nprevailing style of the lighter coloured ceilings at Pompeii. The\r\ndevices are formed of very thin lines of the brightest colours upon\r\nwhite. The Ionic capitals of the columns are from the Basilica. The\r\nshafts of the columns are not fluted at the lower part, the remaining\r\nunfluted surface, together with the mouldings upon the base, are painted\r\nbright red. This is a Pompeian peculiarity. Red is a prevailing colour\r\nat Pompeii, but in the House of the Surgical Instruments, the lower part\r\nof the columns was blue, a dwarf wall between them being painted red.\r\n(Gell, Pompeiana, first series, pl. 25, p. 170.)\r\n\r\n19. THALAMUS, an apartment next to the fauces, and entered by a door\r\nimmediately to the left on entering the ambulatory.\r\n\r\nIt is a strictly private apartment, and the bedchamber of the master of\r\nthe house. The name is taken from the Greek.\r\n\r\nWhite walls and dark red dado. A charming little Cupid occupies the\r\ncentre of each of the three panels, which have a peculiar border to\r\nthem. The upper part of the wall dividing the Thalamus from the fauces\r\nhas been thrown open for the better admission of light and air. The\r\ndecorations of this room are copied from the House of the Dioscuri. On\r\nthe right hand wall are two pictures of great interest and\r\nsprightliness. They are taken from the triclinium or exhedra of the\r\nhouse described by Mr. Falkener, and in his work (p. 64) may be seen\r\nrough outlines done from memory.[60] In the original apartment these\r\npictures form side panels to still larger compositions. Cupids and\r\nPsyches are the only actors in these scenes; and, in the left-hand\r\npicture, a Cupid dances holding an _amphora_ or _diota_ on his left arm.\r\nA Cupid seated on the left of the picture plays a lyre, and other Cupids\r\nare reclining upon couches, beneath an awning. A statue of a bearded\r\nBacchus appears behind, raised on a round pedestal; holding a _thyrsus_\r\nin his left hand. The corresponding picture has a Psyche dancing in\r\nsimilar company, who recline on a couch beneath a broad-spread awning\r\nsupported by branches of trees. The statue at the back is a Psyche\r\nholding a bow in the left hand. A Cupid playing the flute sits on the\r\nleft; a reclining figure near him holds a _scyphus_ or drinking cup. The\r\ndancing Psyche has four butterfly wings and plays the _crotala_ or\r\ncastanets; her feet are bare, but she wears bracelets. This picture is\r\nengraved in the Mus. Bor., vol. xv., tav. 18. Falkener, p. 65.\r\n\r\n  [60] The excessive illiberality of the Neapolitan government can\r\n  hardly be conceived by those who live in a country where leave to copy\r\n  and publish is so freely accorded. No one is allowed to draw a\r\n  monument that has not already been published until after the\r\n  expiration of three years, at the end of which time the paintings are\r\n  so often changed by the fading of colours and the obliteration of the\r\n  details as to render any attempt at copying them hopeless. Falkener,\r\n  pp. 62 and 65.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling has a circular aperture, necessary for the admission of\r\nlight and air, which is authorised by the example in the _caldarium_ of\r\nthe baths at Pompeii (Gell, Pompeiana, vol. i. pl. 31. Zahn, vol. ii.\r\npl. 94.) The doorway breaking irregularly through the panel is not in\r\naccordance with modern notions of order and symmetry.\r\n\r\n20. ŒCUS, so called from the Greek word signifying a house, was\r\nsometimes a very spacious chamber to accommodate guests at a more\r\nextensive banquet than could be held in the triclinium. Here it is\r\nbroad but not deep. The upper part of the walls white, the dado black,\r\nand the intervening spaces red and black surmounted by a rich\r\narchitecturally-painted entablature. It consists of architrave, frieze,\r\nand cornice. The architrave, or lower portion, green with white\r\ngarlands; the frieze above this is purple having red panels bordered\r\nwith yellow, and producing a capital effect; and yellow figures of\r\nSirens, or winged female monsters, which uphold a bold projecting\r\ncornice. The perspective delineation of this cornice, with its supports,\r\nis very remarkable, especially that of the central projection; a similar\r\nboldness of perspective drawing may be seen in Pitt. Erc., vol. iii., p.\r\n109, where the fullest knowledge is evinced of the distribution of light\r\nand shade.\r\n\r\nThe black and red divisions of these walls have large broad devices in\r\ngreen and red upon them. The central picture is a collection of silver\r\nvessels lined with gold, the variety of forms are well worthy of\r\nattention. The pavement of this apartment is inlaid from patterns well\r\nknown at Pompeii. Zahn, vol. ii., pl. 87.\r\n\r\n21. BATH, _Balneum_ or _Balineum_, a small chamber appropriately fitted\r\nup. Light patterns on wall above, and middle spaces green, red, and blue\r\nin broad masses.\r\n\r\n22. A small simply-decorated room, white with red dado.\r\n\r\n23. _The end wall of the peristyle._ Its paintings are conspicuously\r\nseen from the principal entrance of the house. The general colour is\r\nwhite. Dado red and yellow. The three central compartments are copied\r\nfrom the House of the Augustals, or banqueting house commonly known by\r\nthe name of the _Pantheon_. Beneath, a high canopy, supported by thin\r\nand gracefully ornamented columns, stands a lovely female with one foot\r\nupon the step of a door. She is in the act of playing the lyre, holding\r\nthe plectrum with her right hand, and by her song seems to invite\r\nstrangers to enter the portal. Upon the architrave of this porch is a\r\nyellow group of a Winged Victory in a biga driving at full speed,\r\nengraved in Zahn, vol. i., pl. 24. The left-hand figure is a priestess\r\nwith a _prefericulum_, or small pitcher used for sacrifices, in her\r\nright hand, and a bunch of corn and poppies in the other. Her hair is\r\nbound by a yellow circlet, and the upper garment or mantle is remarkably\r\nsimilar to that in the dress of the celebrated Flora of the Capitol.\r\n(See Catalogue of Greek Court, No. 41.) The lower dress is blue and\r\npartly covering her yellow shoes. The architecture, seen through the\r\nportal of the hall which the priestess seems to be leaving, is admirably\r\npainted. The companion picture on the opposite side, is a young man in\r\npurple drapery, turned towards the fair lyrist, and seeming to offer a\r\ngreen wreath. The first two of these figures are engraved in the Museo\r\nBor., vol. iii., tavole 5 and 6. The second one also in Malkin’s\r\nPompeii, vol. ii., p. 315.\r\n\r\nIn the dado, beneath the figures just described, are large square stalls\r\nor recesses. In the centre one is an elegant figure of a girl holding a\r\nlyre, she seems to be sitting on the sill or edge of the opening. This\r\nfigure is engraved in the Mus. Bor., vol. ii., tav. 12., and in Raoul\r\nRochette, Choix de Peintures, pl. 4; Zahn, vol. ii., pl. 77. Gell gives\r\nit in his second series of Pompeiana, vol. i., pl. 14, but surrounded by\r\ndifferent groups to the original, although all are to be found within\r\nthe same building. The group beyond forms a graceful heading to the view\r\nfrom the atrium looking through the right hand fauces, No. 11. It\r\nconsists of two figures, a Victory with expanded wings holding an\r\nincense-burner in her right hand, and a patera in the left. She is\r\ncrowned with laurel, the leaves of which stand like rays about the head.\r\nBehind and above her appears a goddess with a sceptre and tiara, either\r\nVenus or Juno, more probably the former; she is in the act of putting\r\nsome incense into the burner held by the other figure. The patera with\r\nofferings like purple fruit on it, has been converted by Gell and Zahn\r\ninto a painter’s palette and brushes; in the Mus. Bor. the Victory wears\r\nsandals; but in Zahn and Gell more correctly only ankle rings. The play\r\nof line in this group is very pleasing. This group is taken from the\r\nportico of the same building as the other figures, viz., the House of\r\nthe Augustals, commonly called the Pantheon. The ground of the original\r\nis black, here it is rich red. Engraved in Mus. Bor., vol. ii., tav. 19;\r\nGell, vol. i., vignette heading to preface; Zahn, vol. i., pl. 2.\r\n\r\n24. CULINA. The apartment forming an angle of the peristyle was the\r\nkitchen, which is copied from the House of Sallust, excepting that the\r\nstove in this has only one arch instead of two. The painting of an\r\naltar, with eggs between two serpents, is of frequent occurrence.\r\nSerpents were cherished in ancient dwellings as creatures of good omen,\r\nand became domesticated, as quadrupeds are with us. A similar painting\r\nof serpents engraved in Pittore Ercolano, vol. iv., p. 65.\r\n\r\n25. Side entrance into the street, immediately facing the bath.\r\n\r\n26. TRICLINIUM, opposite the Œcus. Large panels, blue, black, and\r\nyellow. Black dado, ceiling white, corresponding to that of the œcus\r\nopposite. The walls are also decorated in the same manner, with the\r\nexception of a frieze of boys carrying large garlands composed of fruits\r\nand flowers entwined with a pink and green ribband. The small central\r\npicture on a blue ground, represents a dish of fruit--grapes,\r\npomegranates, green fig, dates, apricots, apple, and fircone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe triclinium was the dining-room of an ancient Roman house. The guests\r\ndid not sit at table, they reclined on couches arranged round three\r\nsides of a space for the table, leaving the rest open for the servants\r\nto arrange the dishes and move the trays. The word _triclinium_ is\r\nderived from the _three_ couches occupying the apartment which\r\nsurrounded the _mensa_ or table in the manner just described. Much\r\nimportance was attached, in ancient times, to the disposal of the\r\nguests. The right hand couch was the most honourable; the person\r\nreclining upon it, with his left elbow nearest the railing, was the\r\nchief person in the assembly. The Romans were accustomed to rest with\r\nthe left arm upon cushions during their meals, and after dinner to lie\r\nupon their backs and take their repose. In some Pompeian houses, the\r\nthree couches forming the triclinium, were permanently fixed. The\r\naccompanying woodcut shows the arrangement of the places for a party of\r\nnine, the favourite number for a dinner among the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe guests, preparatory to reclining on the couches, took off their\r\nshoes, and were then provided with napkins, generally fringed, and often\r\nrichly embroidered. Water was poured over their hands into basins of\r\nprecious metal, a process repeated many times during an entertainment,\r\nand doubtless very necessary, as the fingers were much used in the\r\ncourse of eating. They had knives and spoons, but forks are entirely a\r\nmodern invention and their mode of eating was very similar to that\r\npractised in oriental countries, where the right hand alone is made use\r\nof. Women, when admitted to the entertainment, always sat upon the\r\ncouches. The same custom may be observed on the painted vases and\r\nbas-reliefs of the Greeks down to a late time.\r\n\r\nThe dinner consisted of three courses; first, the _promulsis_, or\r\n_gustatio_, chiefly stimulants to the appetite; the second contained an\r\nimmense variety of dishes; the principal dish was called _cœnæ caput_ or\r\n_pompa_. Among them chief delicacies were the pheasant, thrush, liver of\r\na capon steeped in milk, and fig-eaters dressed with pepper. Hortensius\r\nthe orator first introduced the peacock. The favourite fish were the\r\nturbot and mullet: eels, also, stewed with prawns. Pork, boar’s-flesh,\r\nand venison, were the most highly esteemed meats. The carving was\r\nperformed to the sound of music, by an especial servant called the\r\n_scissor_, or _carptor_. The third course was the _bellaria_, or\r\ndessert, which consisted of uncooked fruits, such as occupy the centre\r\nof the wall before us. In addition to the fruits of the dessert great\r\nvarieties of pastry were introduced, modelled in imitation of other\r\narticles of food; showers of perfume and occasional jets d’eau\r\ncontributed to the luxury of the scene, but these were extravagancies,\r\nprobably confined to the most wealthy citizens of Rome. The pages of\r\nHorace, Juvenal, Petronius, Martial, Athenæus, Suetonius, Aulus Gellius,\r\nand Macrobius, afford curious detail of these entertainments, from which\r\nwe may easily comprehend the enormous sums they are said to have cost.\r\nAn extraordinary feast is represented, in a painting, at Pompeii,\r\ndescribed by Mr. Donaldson. The table is set out with every requisite\r\nfor a grand dinner. In the centre is a large dish containing four\r\npeacocks, their tails forming a magnificent dome. Around are lobsters,\r\none of which holds in his claws a blue egg, a second an oyster, and\r\nanother a little basket full of grasshoppers. Four dishes of fish\r\ndecorate the bottom, above which are several partridges, hares, and\r\nsquirrels, each holding its head between its paws. These are surrounded\r\nby something resembling a German sausage, then a row of yolks of eggs,\r\nthen a row of peaches, small melons and cherries; lastly, a row of\r\ndifferent vegetables, and the whole seems to be covered by a green\r\ncoloured sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mulsum_, wine made into a syrup by the addition of honey, was handed\r\nround to the guests at the commencement of the feast. Wine was kept in\r\nlarge earthenware jars, called Amphoræ, stopped with a cork or wooden\r\nplug, covered with resin, or gypsum. These amphoræ were sometimes made\r\nof glass. On the outside, the jars were marked with the names of the\r\nconsuls in office at the time of the vintage from which the wine was\r\nmade, to indicate its age. Sometimes little tickets to this effect were\r\nsuspended from the necks. They generally had two ears, and were stored\r\nup in repositories such as were found in the suburban villa (p. 19). It\r\nwas customary at great feasts according to Petronius (chap. xxxiv.) for\r\nthe amphoræ to be shown to the guests for them to read the labels before\r\nthey were opened. Many of these vessels are represented in the paintings\r\nof Pompeii, and several originals from Rome and Alexandria are to be\r\nseen in the British Museum. Some of the glass cups and bowls filled with\r\nwater are admirably represented. In one picture a decanter with the\r\nglass for drinking turned down over it, is in exact accordance with our\r\nmodern custom. Elegant glass vases filled with fruit occur also among\r\nthe paintings of the House of the Augustals, together with small earthen\r\njars, having labels affixed.\r\n\r\nIn great houses it was not unusual for the guests after dinner to enjoy\r\ntheir wine in another room. After-dinner drinking, _comissatio_, or\r\n_convivium_, was equivalent to the _symposium_ of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n27. The WINTER TRICLINIUM. A large square room, corresponding to the\r\nThalamus. The walls are white, with deep red dado. Ceiling coved, and\r\nwith a round aperture similar to the one in Thalamus. On the wall\r\nopposite the door are two beautiful floating Bacchantes, one with\r\nthyrsus and tympanum, the other dressed in pink and blue, holding a\r\nthyrsus in her left hand, and a floating scarf with the other. They are\r\nengraved in Mus. Bor., vol. ii., tav. 4, and in Zahn. vol. ii., pl. 13.\r\nThe Bacchante next the door is the same as in cubiculum 16; her dress\r\nhere is pale blue; she holds the tympanum and thyrsus; a nebris crosses\r\nher breast.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand wall may be seen a most charming group, exquisitely\r\ncoloured, of a Faun supporting a Bacchante. The faun holds a bunch of\r\ngrapes in his right hand, and with the other encircles her waist; his\r\ndrapery is red, and her delicate form is surrounded by a transparent\r\nveil, apparently of gauze. The drapery enveloping the lower part of her\r\nfigure is purple, heightened with white, shoes blue. The effect of the\r\npainting of this group is perfectly fascinating, and entirely realises\r\nthe treatment required for cheerful subjects. The group is engraved in\r\nMus. Bor., vol. xiii., tav. 16, where the background is described as\r\nyellow. The paintings in this room are copied from the House of the\r\nFemale Flute-player and the House of the Bacchantes. The group last\r\ndescribed is in the original of unusually large proportions for such\r\nsubjects, being three-fourths of life size.\r\n\r\nThus, then, we have completed the _gíro_ of the Pompeian house. The\r\nancients, although they have provided the graceful salutation for comers\r\non their threshold in the word SALVE, do not afford the corresponding\r\nword VALE to “speed the parting guest.” Their manes, probably gratified\r\nby the interest now manifested in these monuments of their habits,\r\nrequirements, and enjoyments, desire us to linger within these fairy\r\nwalls, and to indulge in the thoughts of those who would, ages ago, have\r\nfound nothing strange and nothing amiss here, excepting the appearance\r\nof the thronging visitors, whose costume and manners could never have\r\nbeen anticipated. The house, as we see it, is really a house such as the\r\nexcavations might reveal. We have already shown that every part has its\r\nprototype at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nThe style of decorative painting during the earliest times of the empire\r\nmerits attention. It is here exhibited on a larger scale and in a much\r\nmore extensive series than ever before attempted in England; affording,\r\nin fact, the sole method by which such decorations can be fully\r\nunderstood. The subjects of the small central wall panels, and a few of\r\nthe grotesque devices, have been often published, and are familiar to us\r\nthrough the medium both of prints and coloured copies; isolated\r\nportions, however, cannot suffice to give an idea of the harmonious\r\neffect that may be produced in mural decoration, by masses of even crude\r\ncolour, when conjoined in proper proportion with others equally\r\ncrude.[61] The eye at Pompeii is never offended by a want of balance in\r\narrangement; and the system of confining the heaviest colours to the\r\nlower part of the room has been already noticed. Even copies of the same\r\npicture that come to England, on comparison, exhibit variations which\r\ndestroy all feeling of confidence in their accuracy. They are for the\r\nmost part so small as to conceal many important peculiarities of style,\r\nand can only serve as souvenirs. Here we see nothing on a reduced scale\r\n(except in Thalamus, No. 27), the paintings are not only of the same\r\nsize as at Pompeii, but even the exactitude of the outlines is\r\nguaranteed to us by the fact of their having been _traced_ from the\r\noriginals.\r\n\r\n  [61] These colours could not appear equally crude to the ancients on\r\n  account of the necessary darkness that pervaded their apartments. See\r\n  _ante_, p. 31.\r\n\r\nThe scale and finish of the patterns have to a great extent been\r\nregulated by the size of the rooms which they adorn; and it will be seen\r\nthat in the smaller rooms patterns must necessarily be more minute, and\r\nthe form of the wall itself less regarded than in a larger apartment\r\nwhere they are viewed at a greater distance. The lightness of the\r\narchitectural representations and their connection has been already\r\nmentioned. The painters seem to have delighted in representing every\r\nvariety of pavilion, colonnade, balcony steps, rooms and corners, in\r\nshort, all the _ins and outs_ and _ups_ and _downs_ peculiar to\r\nbuildings erected to form upper floors. They are, in fact, at variance\r\nwith the ground stories actually remaining at Pompeii, where all columns\r\nand piers of brick and stone are comparatively massive, without any\r\ntraces whatever of intermediate supports of wood or metal, such as are\r\nrepresented in the paintings. The _arabesque_ devices which occupy so\r\nmuch of the wall space of Pompeii are replete with imagination and\r\ningenious variety. There is, notwithstanding the censures of Vitruvius,\r\nwhich are inserted in page 69, such a playfulness and elegance in the\r\ncombination of objects so unexpectedly brought together, that we\r\ntolerate incongruities, and regard the whole as a dreamlike succession\r\nof images, passing easily from one to the other, without any\r\nconsideration of that which has gone before. The children rising out of\r\nflowers are charming; and the living lions, rushing through _scroll\r\nwork_ of the brightest hues, such as no living lions ever saw, are\r\npurely ornamental conceits. Again, the reeds for columns, with all the\r\nbotanical details, of _nodes_ and _internodes_, are extremely graceful;\r\nand with their rich colour and firm appearance, notwithstanding an\r\nextreme slenderness, they should be very suggestive to our metal workers\r\nas means of support. The monsters sometimes perched upon them, in\r\nperfect illustration of the words of Vitruvius, excite our surprise, and\r\nbeing frequently ugly in themselves, incline us to agree with the\r\nillustrious architect in wishing them away; but at the same time,\r\nwithout such paintings before us, how impossible it would be to\r\ncomprehend the passages in his book relating to such matters, and\r\ndepending for their effect upon the eye alone. The beautiful devices of\r\nthe _stanza nera_, cubiculum No. 1, are sufficient illustrations of the\r\ngrace with which incongruities may be combined, and how in a very small\r\napartment, where minute decorations are appropriately introduced, each\r\nportion is to be read, as it were, by itself, or, if regarded generally,\r\nto seem merely a playful arrangement of colours relieving the monotony\r\nof the wall.\r\n\r\nLandscapes as seen in cubicula 3 and 15 are said to be peculiarly the\r\ninvention of Ludius, who lived in the early period of the empire. His\r\nconceits, as described by Pliny, have something almost Chinese about\r\nthem, and his chief desire seems to have been to amuse and occupy the\r\nspectators. Extensive landscape views were found in the House of the\r\nDioscuri in the four cubicula on the extreme right, seen in plan (No. 8,\r\non page 39). An extensive painting of a sea-port was discovered in the\r\nHouse of the Small Fountain (plan No. 6). Some very quaint coast scenes,\r\nwith enormous gallies, are engraved as vignettes in Pitture d’Ercolano,\r\nvol. iii., pp. 7 and 13. An extensive scene of a crowded mole, adorned\r\nwith statues and arches, with a distant town and crowded boats on the\r\nwater, is engraved at page 47 of the same vol. At page 279 of the same,\r\nis a curious representation of various figures on a wet, slippery\r\nground, as described by Pliny in the paintings of Ludius. An extensive\r\nscene of a port, with shipping, numerous statues raised on columns,\r\nhouses, gardens, people in boats and angling on the shore, was found at\r\nStabiæ; it is engraved in vol. ii., page 295, of Pitture d’Ercolano.\r\nEight small circular views of land and sea, animated by numerous\r\nfigures, were also found at Stabiæ. They are engraved in the same volume\r\nat pp. 277, 281, 285, and 289, and form very important illustrations of\r\nancient life and scenery. Curious buildings may be seen in vignettes on\r\npage 105 of same volume. A remarkable painting of a creek with four\r\nlarge ships filled with armed soldiers, with three rows of oars, is\r\nengraved in vol i., page 243. The gallies filled with armed troops are\r\nseen also in page 239. A curious latticed window in a landscape in page\r\n229. These landscape views are all admirably engraved, in a faithful\r\nimitation of the masses of light and shade, and with careful attention\r\nto the smallest detail. In the Museo Borbonico, on the contrary, the\r\nstyle of engraving fails to render any one of the peculiarities of\r\ntheir execution. Many vignette landscapes are characteristically copied\r\nin vol. ii. of Gell’s Pompeiana, but they have not the completeness or\r\nrichness of the Pitture d’Ercolano. Some curious illustrations of the\r\nsocial life of the Pompeians may be found in a series of pictures\r\nrepresenting the ancient Forum of that city, thronged with the same\r\nvariety of people that may be seen in the market places of Naples and\r\nother Italian cities, all occupied in similarly varied occupations of\r\nbuying and selling, talking and idling; they supplied Bulwer with\r\nseveral incidents for his description, and have been engraved in vol.\r\niii., page 213 to 231 of Pitture d’Ercolano.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the frequent occurrence elsewhere of ancient paintings\r\ninscribed with the names of persons they are intended to represent,\r\nscarcely any instances have been met with in the cities overwhelmed by\r\nVesuvius. The word DIDV is written in one picture in white characters\r\nnear the head of a figure. The fragment was found at Stabiæ; it is\r\nengraved in vol. iii., page 231, of Pitture d’Ercolano. On the\r\ncelebrated marble slab, monochrome drawings by Alexander of Athens; the\r\nartist has not only inscribed his own name, but those of the five\r\nfemales in his composition. It represents the visit of Niobe and her\r\ndaughters to Latona. This picture was found at Herculaneum, May 24,\r\n1746. A very beautiful little mosaic was inscribed with the name of\r\nDioscorides, of Samos, as the artist; thus:\r\n\r\n  ΔΙΟΣΚΟΥΡΙΔΗΣ ΣΑΜΙΟΣ ΕΠΟΙΗΣΕ.\r\n\r\nThere is great diversity of opinion amongst antiquarians as to the\r\nmeaning of some of the most important pictures discovered at Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum, which might have been obviated had the names of the\r\ncharacters been written upon them, as we see upon the ancient Greek\r\nvases, and upon the paintings of Polygnotus, and the chest of Cypselus,\r\ndescribed by Pausanias, and, to descend to later and very different\r\ntimes, the well-known Bayeux tapestry, illustrating the history of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. In default of inscription, the Pompeian pictures\r\ncan only be interpreted by their similarity to the descriptions of other\r\nancient paintings left us by Pausanias, Lucian, Ælian, and Philostratus.\r\nThe following extract from Vitruvius, book vii., chap. 5, affords a most\r\nimportant view of what innovations took place in his time, showing also,\r\nthat even before the time of Augustus, mural decorations were composed\r\nof extensive architectural fancies, as well as harbours, landscapes, and\r\nsea-pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM VITRUVIUS.\r\n\r\nBook vii., Chap. 5.\r\n\r\n“In other apartments--that is, in those of Spring, Autumn, and Summer,\r\nas also in the atrium and peristylium--the ancients have established\r\ncertain methods of painting. A picture is the representation of things\r\nthat are, or may be, as men, buildings, ships, and other things; of\r\nwhich the copy, by having the exact form and outlines of the real body,\r\nassumes the likeness. The ancients, who originally instituted this\r\nmanner of decoration, at first imitated the varieties and marks of\r\nmarble incrustation, then cornices, disposing between them divers\r\nsilacious and miniaceous coloured ornaments. They proceeded afterwards\r\nto represent edifices with columns and pediments projecting; but in\r\nspacious places, such as exedræ, on account of the amplitude of the\r\nwalls, they represented the fronts of scenes in the tragic, comic, or\r\nsatyric manner; and ambulatories, being of a great length, they\r\nornamented with landscapes, expressing the appearance of particular\r\nplaces, painting harbours, promontories, sea coasts, rivers, fountains,\r\ncanals, temples, groves, mountains, cattle, and shepherds; in some\r\nplaces, also, large paintings of figures, representing the gods, or\r\nfabulous histories, the Trojan war, or the wanderings of Ulysses, and\r\nother subjects of a similar kind, which are conformable to the nature of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“But these subjects, which our forefathers copied from nature, are now,\r\nby our depraved manners, disapproved; for monsters, rather than the\r\nresemblances of natural objects, are painted on the stucco, reeds are\r\nsubstituted for columns, and for the pediments, fluted harpaginetuli,\r\nwith curling foliage and volutes; also candelabra supporting the forms\r\nof little buildings, their pediments rising out of roots, with numerous\r\nvolutes and tender stalks, having, contrary to reason, images sitting on\r\nthem; so also the flowers from stalks have half figures springing\r\ntherefrom, with heads, some like those of men, some like those of\r\nbeasts, which things neither are nor can be, nor ever were: and this new\r\nmode so prevails that those who are not judges disregard the arts--for\r\nhow is it possible for reeds to support a roof--or candelabra buildings\r\nand the ornaments of pediments--or stalks, which are so slender and\r\nsoft, sitting figures--or the flowers of stalks produce half images? Yet\r\nmen, being accustomed to the sight of these absurdities, do not censure,\r\nbut are pleased with them, without considering whether they be proper or\r\nnot; the judgment, depraved by habit, examines not whether they be\r\naccording to propriety and the rules of decor; for pictures should not\r\nbe approved unless they be conformable to truth, even although they be\r\nwell executed, they ought, therefore, to be immediately condemned unless\r\nthey can bear the trial of rational examination without being\r\ndisapproved.\r\n\r\n“Thus at Tralles, when Apaturius of Alabanda had excellently well\r\npainted a scene in the little theatre, which with them is called the\r\nEcclesiasterion, and instead of columns had placed statues and centaurs,\r\nsupporting the epistylium, the circular roof of the dome, and projecting\r\ncorners of the pediments, and ornamented the cornice with lions’ heads,\r\nall which have reference to the roofing and eaves of edifices; above\r\nthese, nevertheless, in the episcene, domes, porticos, semipediments,\r\nand all the various parts of buildings were again painted; wherefore\r\nupon the appearance of this scene, when by reason of its enrichment it\r\nwas found pleasing to all, and they were ready to applaud the work,\r\nLicinius, the mathematician, then advanced and said, ‘the Alabandines\r\nare sufficiently intelligent in all civil affairs, but for a trifling\r\nimpropriety are deemed injudicious; for the statues in their gymnasium\r\nare all in the attitude of pleading causes, while those in the forum are\r\nholding the discus, or in the attitude of running or playing with balls;\r\nso that the unsuitableness of the attitudes of the figures to the\r\npurposes of the places, throws a public disgrace upon the city. Let us\r\nthen take care that by the scene of Apaturius we are not deemed\r\nAlabandines, or even Abderites; for who among you places upon the tiles\r\nof the roofs of your houses columns or pediments? These things are\r\nplaced upon the floors, not upon the tiles. If then we approve in\r\npainting what cannot be in fact, we of this city shall be like those\r\nwho, on account of the same error, are deemed illiterate.’ Apaturius\r\ndared not to reply, but took down the scene and altered it so as to be\r\nconsistent to truth; after which it was approved. I, with the immortal\r\ngods, would restore Licinius to life, that he might correct this folly\r\nand fashionable disfigurement of our stucco work; but why a false\r\novercomes a just mode it will not be foreign to the purpose to explain.\r\n\r\n“The ancients, with labour and application, endeavoured to make their\r\nworks be approved by the excellences of art; this is now supplied by the\r\nbeauty of colours, and the use of those of the most costly kind; and\r\nthat value which was formerly given to works by the skill of the artist,\r\nis not desired since the expense of the proprietor supplies its place.\r\nWho among the ancients is known to have used minium otherwise than\r\nsparingly and as a medicine? But now it is everywhere laid over the\r\nwhole wall; it is the same with crysocolla, ostrum, and armenium, which,\r\nwhen laid, although without any art, appear very brilliant to the sight,\r\nand they are so costly, that it is usually specified in the articles of\r\nagreement that they shall be purchased by the proprietor, and not by the\r\ncontractor.”\r\n\r\nPliny, also, who perished, it must be remembered, dining the\r\nconflagration of the cities (see page 8), affords some curious testimony\r\nto the popularity of this mode of decoration, and of one particular\r\npainter, Ludius. He says, book xxxv., chapter 10--\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM PLINY’S NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n“Ludius was he who first devised to beautify the walls of a house with\r\nthe pleasantest painting that is in all variety; to wit, with the\r\nresemblance of manors, farms, and houses of pleasure in the country;\r\nhavens, vinets, flower-work in knots; groves, woods, forests, hills,\r\nfish-pools, conduits and drains, rivers, riverets, with their banks, and\r\npeople, some walking and going to and fro on foot, others sailing and\r\nrowing up and down the stream upon the water, or else riding by land to\r\ntheir farms, either mounted upon then mules and asses, or else in\r\nwaggons and coaches; there a man should see folk, in this place fishing\r\nand angling, in that place hawking and fowling; some hunting here, the\r\nhare, the fox, or deer, both red and sallow; others busy there, in\r\nharvest or vintage. In this manner of painting, a man should behold of\r\nhis workmanship, fair houses, standing among marshes, into which all the\r\nways that lead be ticklish and full of bogs; where you should see the\r\npaths so slippery, that women as they go are afraid to let one foot\r\nafore another; some at every step ready to slide, others bending forward\r\nwith their heads, as though they carried some burdens upon their neck\r\nand shoulders, and all for fear lest, their feet sliding under them,\r\nthey should catch a fall; and a thousand more devices and pretty\r\nconceits as these, full of pleasure and delight. The same Ludius devised\r\nwalls without doors, and abroad in the open air, to paint cities\r\nstanding by the sea-shore: all which kind of painting pleaseth the eye\r\nexceedingly well, and is besides of little or no cost. Howbeit, neither\r\nhe nor any artificers of this kind--howsoever otherwise respected--grew\r\never to be famous and of great name; that felicity attained they only\r\nunto who used to paint in tables, and therefore in this regard,\r\nvenerable antiquity we have in greater admiration; for painters in old\r\ntime loved not to garnish walls for to pleasure the master only of the\r\nhouse, nor yet to bedeck in houses that manner that cannot stir out of\r\nthe place nor shift and save themselves when fire cometh, as painted\r\ntables may that are to be removed with ease.”\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of an ancient house from the descriptions of ancient\r\nauthors has been several times attempted.\r\n\r\nPirro Ligorio, a Neapolitan architect, erected the villa Pia, 1570, for\r\nPope Pius V. It was built in imitation of the houses of the ancients,\r\nwhose architecture he had particularly studied. Mazois, whose large work\r\non Pompeii has formed, as it were, the basis of almost all Pompeian\r\nstudies, wrote an elaborate essay on the palaces of the ancient Romans,\r\nunder the title “Le Palais de Scaurus.” In this all the descriptions of\r\nancient authors were supposed to be comprised. His work, however, was\r\nconfined to the pen; and it is to be regretted that Mazois did not\r\nundertake an architectural reproduction, as an actual copy of one of the\r\nhouses he explored whilst they were comparatively perfect, and for which\r\nhe was so thoroughly qualified. Only _one_ undertaking of this kind has\r\npreceded the Pompeian Court at Sydenham. It was prompted by the taste of\r\na monarch, remarkable for his interest in the fine arts of all nations\r\nand all ages. The ex-king of Bavaria had a villa built at Aschaffenburg,\r\nwhich was the complete restoration of an ancient Roman house found at\r\nPompeii. It was erected by the celebrated architect, Gärtner, and is an\r\nexact copy of the House of the Dioscuri.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Pompeii is but too frequently disappointed at the\r\ncrumbling condition of the disentombed city; and the majority take\r\nlittle trouble to trace the origin of this first and unfavourable\r\nimpression. They do not reflect upon the relation between different\r\nportions of the ruins, the use or particular object originally served,\r\nthe custom that produced it, or the former appearance of the details in\r\nthe harmony of their original arrangement, with the groups of gaily\r\nattired inhabitants giving animation to the scene. Like the greater\r\nportion of the curious who throng the Elgin Saloon of the British\r\nMuseum, for the purpose of taking a peep at the mutilated fragments of\r\nthe marbles contained within its walls, such visitors to Pompeii look\r\nfor excellencies that do not exist, and a harmony incompatible with the\r\nactual condition of the remains; and, discontented at finding things in\r\nopposition to their own conceptions, they depart with imperfect and even\r\nprejudiced ideas of what they really have beheld. Few arrive at Pompeii\r\nwith even a general idea of the appearance of an ancient Roman house,\r\nand are thus incapable of judging of the actual importance of the\r\ncrumbling remains of the buried cities.\r\n\r\nRepeated visits, and careful and laborious investigation, are necessary\r\nfor perfect comprehension of the value of the ruins, in guiding the\r\nobserver towards an accurate idea of the state of the city in its prime.\r\nTo the careless and the uninitiated these few scattered fragments,\r\nsnatched from the very jaws of desolation, will afford but a faint\r\nreflection of the glory and the triumphs that have for ever passed away.\r\n\r\nSuch were the persevering studies of Cockerell, Digby Wyatt, Donaldson,\r\nFalkener, Gell, Hayes, Mazois, and Zahn; and to their investigations we\r\nare indebted for all the conclusions displayed in this interesting\r\nbuilding. We behold at a glance the result of the experience of many\r\nyears, and the combined exertions of our most distinguished architects,\r\nand may safely assert that no more agreeable method than that afforded\r\nby this reconstruction could be devised for making the public acquainted\r\nwith the details of a Pompeian house.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n  In the Atrium are placed two handsome marble benches, such as the\r\n  clients might have sat upon whilst waiting for audience with their\r\n  patron. The ends, which are elaborately carved, have been copied from\r\n  an original model in the Vatican Museum, and the whole has been\r\n  presented to the Crystal Palace Company by the London Marble Working\r\n  Company, through their secretary, Mr. Clare.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADBURY AND EVANS, PRINTERS, WHITEFRIARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF PANSA.
