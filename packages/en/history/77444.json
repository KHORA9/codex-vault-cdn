S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLED TOWNS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stone-flagged path on the top of the high walls winds along within\r\nthe battlemented parapet, broken here and there by round turrets,\r\nsteeple-crowned barriers of big timbers and, at wider intervals, great\r\ntowers, round or square or many-sided, where bright banners blow in\r\nthe unsullied air. From one side you may look down on and into the\r\ndim city jostling the ramparts with crowding walls and dizzy roofs,\r\nfrom the other the granite scarp drops sheer to the green fields and\r\nvari-coloured gardens and shadowy orchards full forty feet below.\r\n\r\nWithin, the city opens up in kaleidoscopic vistas as you walk slowly\r\naround the walls: here are the steep roofs of tall houses with delicate\r\ndormers, fantastic chimney stacks, turret cupolas with swinging weather\r\nvanes; here the closed gardens of rich burgesses, full of arbours,\r\nflowers, pleached alleys of roses, _espaliers_ of pear and nectarine;\r\nhere a convent or guild chapel, newly worked of yellow stone and all\r\nembroidered with the garniture of niches, balustrades, pinnacles.\r\nHere, under one of the city gates, opens a main street, narrow and\r\nwinding but walled with high-gabled houses, each story jutting beyond\r\nthe lower, carved from pavement to ridge like an Indian jewel casket,\r\nand all bedecked with flaming colour and burnished gold-leaf. Below\r\nis the stream and eddy of human life; craftsmen in the red and blue\r\nand yellow of their guild liveries, slow-pacing merchants and burghers\r\nin furred gowns of cramoisy and Flemish wool and gold-woven Eastern\r\nsilks; scholars in tippet and gown, youths in slashed doublets and gay\r\nhose, grey friars and black and brown, with a tonsured monk or two,\r\nand perhaps a purple prelate, attended, and made way for with deep\r\nreverence. Threading the narrow road rides a great lady on a gaily\r\ncaparisoned palfrey, with an officious squire in attendance, or perhaps\r\na knight in silver armour, crested wonderfully, his emblazoned shield\r\nhanging at his saddle-bow,--living colour mixing and changing between\r\nleaning walls of still colour and red gold.\r\n\r\nHere a stream or canal cuts the houses in halves, a quay with gay\r\nbooths and markets of vari-coloured vegetables along one side, walls of\r\npink brick or silvery stone on the other, jutting oriels hanging over\r\nthe stream, and high, curved bridges, each with its painted shrine,\r\ncrossing here and there, with gaudy boats shoving along underneath.\r\nHere a square opens out, ringed with carved houses,--a huge guild hall\r\non one side, with its dizzy watch-tower where hang the great alarum\r\nbells; long rows of Gothic arches, tall mullioned windows, and tiers\r\nand ranges of niched statues all gold and gules and azure, painted\r\nperhaps by Messer Jan Van Eyck or Messer Hans Memling. In the centre\r\nis a spurting fountain with its gilt figures and chiselled parapet,\r\nand all around are market booths with bright awnings where you may buy\r\nstrange things from far lands, chaffering with dark men from Syria and\r\nSaracen Spain and Poland and Venice and Muscovy.\r\n\r\nAnd everywhere, tall in the midst of tall towers and spires, vast,\r\nsilvery, light as air yet solemn and dominating, the great shape of\r\nthe Cathedral, buttressed, pinnacled, beautiful with rose windows and\r\ninnumerable figures of saints and angels and prophets.\r\n\r\nThere is no smoke and no noxious gas; the wind that sweeps over the\r\nroofs and around the delicate spires is as clean and clear as it is\r\nin the mountains; the painted banners flap and strain, and the trees\r\nin the gardens rustle beneath. There is no sound except human sound;\r\nthe stir and murmur of passing feet, the pleasant clamour of voices,\r\nthe muffled chanting of cloistered nuns in some veiled chapel, the\r\nshrill cry of street venders and children, and the multitudinous bells\r\nsounding for worship in monastery or church and, at dawn and noon and\r\nevening, the answering clangour of each to all for the Angelus.\r\n\r\nAnd from the farther side of the walls a wide country of green and\r\ngold and the far, thin blue of level horizon or distant mountains.\r\nThere are no slums and no suburbs and no mills and no railway yards;\r\nthe green fields and the yellow grain, the orchards and gardens and\r\nthickets of trees sweep up to the very walls, slashed by winding white\r\nroads. Alongside the river, limpid and unstained, are mills with slow\r\nwheels dripping quietly, there where the great bridge with its seven\r\nGothic arches and its guarding towers curves in a long arc from shore\r\nto shore. Far away is perhaps a grey monastery with its tall towers,\r\nand on the hill a greyer castle looming out of the woods. Along the\r\nroad blue-clad peasants come and go with swaying flocks of sheep and\r\nfowl and cattle. Here are dusty pilgrims with staff and wallet and\r\nbroad hats, pursy merchants on heavy horses with harness of red velvet\r\nand gold embroidery; a squadron of mounted soldiers with lances and\r\nbanners, and perhaps my Lord Bishop on his white mule, surrounded by\r\nhis retainers, and on progress to his see city from some episcopal\r\nvisitation; perhaps even a plumed and visored knight riding on quest or\r\nto join a new Crusade to the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nColour everywhere, in the fresh country, in the carven houses, in\r\ngilded shrines and flapping banners, in the clothes of the people like\r\na covey of vari-coloured tropical birds. No din of noise, no pall of\r\nsmoke, but fresh air blowing within the city and without, even through\r\nthe narrow streets, none too clean at best, but cleaner far than they\r\nwere to be thereafter and for many long centuries to come.\r\n\r\nSuch was any walled town in the fifteenth century, let us say in\r\nFrance or England or Italy, in Flanders or Spain or the Rhineland.\r\nCarcassonne, Rothenbourg, San Gimignano, Oxford, ghosts of the past,\r\narouse hauntings of memory today, but they tell us little, for the\r\ncolour is gone, and the stillness and the clean air. Ghosts they are\r\nand not living things; and life, colour, clarity, these were the\r\noutward marks of the Walled Towns of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“It was not a pretty station where McCann found himself, and he glared\r\nill-naturedly around with restless, aggressive eyes. The brick walls,\r\nthe cheaply grained doors bearing their tarnished legends, “Gents,”\r\n“Ladies,” “Refreshment Saloon,” the rough raftered roof over the\r\ntracks,--everything was black and grimy with years of smoke, belching\r\neven now from the big locomotive, and gathering like an ill-conditioned\r\nthunder-cloud over the mob of scurrying, pushing men and women, a mob\r\nthat swelled and scattered constantly in fretful confusion. A hustling\r\nbusiness-man with a fat, pink face and long sandy whiskers, his silk\r\nhat cocked on one side in grotesque assumption of jauntiness, tripped\r\nover the clay-covered pick of a surly labourer, red of face and sweaty,\r\nblue of overalls and mud-coloured of shirt, and as he stumbled over the\r\nannoying implement scowled coarsely, and swore, with his cigar between\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\n“Ragged and grimy children, hardly old enough to walk, sprawled\r\nand scrambled on the dirty platform, and as McCann hurried by, a\r\nfive-year-old cursed shrilly a still more youthful little tough,\r\nwho answered in kind. Vulgar theatre-bills in rank reds and yellows\r\nflaunted on the cindery walls; discarded newspapers, banana skins,\r\ncigar butts, and saliva were ground together vilely under foot by the\r\nscuffling mob. Dirt, meanness, ugliness everywhere--in the unhappy\r\npeople no less than in their surroundings....\r\n\r\n“The prospect was not much better outside than in. The air was thick\r\nwith fine white dust, and dazzling with fierce sunlight. On one side\r\nwas a wall of brick tenements, with liquor saloons, cheap groceries,\r\nand a fish-market below, all adding their mite to the virulence of\r\nthe dead, stifling air. Above, men in dirty shirt-sleeves lolled out\r\nof the grimy windows, where long festoons of half-washed clothes\r\ndrooped sordidly. On the other side, gangs of workmen were hurriedly\r\nrepairing the ravages of a fire that evidently had swept clear a large\r\nspace in its well-meant but ineffectual attempts at purgation. Gaunt\r\nblack chimneys wound with writhing gas-pipes, tottering fragments of\r\nwall blistered white on one side, piles of crumbling bricks where men\r\nworked sullenly loading blue carts, mingled with new work, where the\r\nwalls, girdled with yellow scaffolding, were rising higher, uglier than\r\nbefore; the plain factory walls with their rows of square windows less\r\nhideous by far than those buildings where some ignorant contractor was\r\ntrying by the aid of galvanized iron to produce an effect of tawdry,\r\nlying magnificence. Dump-carts, market-waggons, shabby hacks, crawled\r\nor scurried along in the hot dust. A huge dray loaded with iron bars\r\njolted over the granite pavement with a clanging, clattering din that\r\nwas maddening. In fact, none of the adjuncts of a thriving, progressive\r\ntown were absent, so far as one could see....\r\n\r\n“The carriage threaded its way through the roaring crowd of vehicles,\r\npassing the business part of the city, and entering a tract given over\r\nto factories, hideous blocks of barren brick and shabby clapboards,\r\nthrough the open windows of which came the brain-killing whir of heavy\r\nmachinery, and hot puffs of oily air. Here and there would be small\r\nareas between the buildings where foul streams of waste from some\r\nfactory of cheap calico would mingle dirtily with pools of green,\r\nstagnant water, the edges barred with stripes of horrible pinks and\r\npurples where the water had dried under the fierce sun. All around\r\nlay piles of refuse,--iron hoops, broken bottles, barrels, cans,\r\nold leather stewing and fuming in the dead heat, and everywhere\r\nescape-pipes vomiting steam in spurts. Over it all was the roar of\r\nindustrial civilization. McCann cast a pitying look at the pale,\r\ndispirited figures passing languidly to and fro in the midst of the din\r\nand the foul air, and set his teeth closely.\r\n\r\n“Presently they entered that part of the city where live the poor, they\r\nwho work in the mills, when they are not on strike, or the mills are\r\nnot shut down,--as barren of trees or grass as the centre of the city,\r\nthe baked grey earth trodden hard between the crowded tenements painted\r\nlifeless greys, as dead in colour as the clay about them. Children and\r\ngoats crawled starvedly around or huddled in the hot shadow of the\r\nsides of the houses. This passed, and then came the circle of “suburban\r\nresidences,” as crowded almost as the tottering tenements, but with\r\ngreen grass around them. Frightful spectacles these,--“Queen Anne” and\r\n“Colonial” vagaries painted lurid colours, and frantic in their cheap\r\nelaboration. Between two affected little cottages painted orange and\r\ngreen and with round towers on their corners, stood a new six-story\r\napartment-house with vulgar front of brown stone, “Romanesque” in\r\nstyle, but with long flat sides of cheap brick. McCann caught the\r\nname on the big white board that announced “Suites to let.” “Hotel\r\nPlantagenet,” and grinned savagely.\r\n\r\n“Then, at last, even this region of speculative horrors came to an end,\r\ngiving place to a wide country road that grew more and more beautiful\r\nas they left the town far behind. McCann’s eyebrows were knotted in a\r\nscowl. The ghastly nonsense, like a horrible practical joke, that the\r\ncity had been to him, excited, as it always did, all the antagonism\r\nwithin his rebellious nature. Slowly and grimly he said to himself,\r\nyet half aloud, in a tone of deliberation, as though he were cursing\r\nsolemnly the town he had left: ‘I hope from my soul that I may live to\r\nsee the day when that damned city will be a desolate wilderness; when\r\nthose chimneys shall rise smokeless; when those streets shall be stony\r\nvalleys between grisly ridges of fallen brick; when Nature itself shall\r\nshrink from repairing the evil that man has wrought; when the wild\r\nbirds shall sweep widely around that desolation that they may not pass\r\nabove; when only rats and small snakes shall crawl though the ruin of\r\nthat “thriving commercial and manufacturing metropolis”; when the very\r\nname it bore in the days of its dirty glory shall have become a synonym\r\nfor horror and despair!’ Having thus relieved himself he laughed\r\nsoftly, and felt better.”[A]\r\n\r\n[A] “The Decadent,” 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the way out? The question that was universal during the war,\r\n“How has this thing come?” gives place to the other that is no less\r\npoignant and no less universal, “What is the way out?” There must be\r\na way; this coil of uttermost confusion must be solvable, must be\r\nsolved--_if only we knew the way!_ There can be no going back, of that\r\nwe are sure, and the industry of the serious-minded men, busy with set\r\nfaces and a brave optimism, in their cheerful efforts to restore the\r\nold course of events after an accidental interlude, fills us with a\r\nkind of shame that people who have lived through the war should have\r\nlearned so little both of the war and from it. Four years have ended\r\nthe work of four centuries and--there is no going back. “Finis” has\r\nbeen written at the end of a long episode and there is no way by which\r\nwe can knit together again the strands that are severed forever. There\r\nis even less desire than ability. It does not show very well in the\r\nred light of war, that act in the great world-drama that opened with\r\nthe dissolution of Mediævalism and the coming of the Renaissance; that\r\ndeveloped through the Reformation, the revolutions of the eighteenth\r\ncentury and the sequent industrialism, to its climax and catastrophe\r\nin war. There is little in it we would have back if we could, but the\r\nunstable equilibrium in which we hang for the moment, poised between\r\nreactionism and universal anarchy, cannot last; already the balance\r\nis inclining towards chaos, and in the six months that will intervene\r\nbetween the writing of this and its publication it may very well be\r\nthat the decision of inertia will be made and the plunge effected that\r\nwill bring us down into that unintelligent repetition of history now so\r\nclearly indicated in Russia, Austria, Germany. We can neither return\r\nnor remain but--would we go on, at least along the lines that are at\r\npresent indicated? Are we tempted by the savage and stone-age ravings\r\nand ravenings of Bolshevism? Have we any inclination towards that\r\nsuper-imperialism of the pacifist-internationalist-Israelitish “League\r\nof Free Nations” that comes in such questionable shape? Does State\r\nSocialism with all its materialistic mechanisms appeal to us? Other\r\nalleviation is not offered and in these we can see no encouragement.\r\n\r\nIt is the eternal dilemma of the Two Alternatives, which is\r\nnevertheless no more than a vicious sophism: “Either you will take this\r\nor you must have that,” the starling-cry of partizan politics by which\r\n“democracies” have lived. In all human affairs there are never only\r\ntwo alternatives, there is always a third and sometimes more; but this\r\nunrecognized alternative never commands that popular leadership which\r\n“carries the election,” and it does not appeal to a public that prefers\r\nthe raw obviousness of the extremes. Yet it is the third alternative\r\nthat is always the right one, except when the God-made leaders, the\r\ntime having come for a new upward rush of the vital force in society,\r\nput themselves in the vanguard of the new advance and lift the world\r\nwith them, as it were by main force. Reactionism or Bolshevism: “Under\r\nwhich king, Bezonian? Speak or die!” We are told that the old world\r\nof before-the-war must be restored in its integrity or we must fall\r\na victim to the insane anarchy of a proletariat in revolt, and for\r\nmany of us there is little to choose between the two. We have seen how\r\nfragile, artificial and insecure is civilization, how instantly and\r\nhopelessly it can crumble into a sort of putrid dissolution the moment\r\nits conventions are challenged and the ultimate principles of democracy\r\nare put in practice, and we do not like it. We have seen Russia,\r\nGermany, Hungary, and sporadic but disquieting examples in every State,\r\nno matter how conservative it may be or how successful in a first\r\nstamping out of the flame. On the other hand, we saw the triumph of\r\n“Modern Civilization” in the twenty-five years preceding the Great\r\nWar, and as we realize now what it was, through the revelations it has\r\nmade of itself during the last five years, we like it quite as little\r\nas the other. We see it now as an impossible farrago of false values,\r\nof loud-mouthed sentimentality and crude, cold-blooded practices; of\r\ngross, all-pervading injustice sicklied o’er with the pale cast of\r\nsmug humanitarianism; a democracy of form that was without ideal or\r\nreality in practice; imperialism, materialism and the quantitative\r\nstandard. Is there no alternative other than this, restored in its\r\nunvarying ugliness of fact and of manifestation, or the imitative era\r\nof a new Dark Ages which will be brought to pass by the new hordes of\r\nHuns and Vandals that again, after fifteen centuries, menace a greater\r\nImperialism than Rome with an identical fate? There _is_ a third\r\nalternative; there may be more, but the one which makes its argument\r\nfor acceptance on the basis of history and experience is here put\r\nforward for consideration.\r\n\r\nIn three books already published in this series which has been issued\r\nfrom time to time during the Great War--“The Nemesis of Mediocrity,”\r\n“The Great Thousand Years” and “The Sins of the Fathers”--I have tried\r\nto determine certain of the causes which led to the tragical _débâcle_\r\nof modern civilization at the very moment of its highest supremacy;\r\nand now while mediocrity pitifully struggles to meet and solve an\r\navalanche of problems it cannot cope withal, and anarchy, like Alaric\r\nand Attila and Genseric at the head of their united hosts, beat against\r\nthe dissolving barriers of a forlorn and impotent and discredited\r\nculture, I would try to find some hints of the saving alternative, and\r\nif possible discover some way out of the deadly _impasse_ in which the\r\nworld finds itself.\r\n\r\nFrom “The Nemesis of Mediocrity” it should be sufficiently clear\r\nthat I do not believe that any mechanical devices whatever will\r\nserve the purpose: neither the buoyant plan to “make the world safe\r\nfor democracy,” nor any extension and amplification of “democratic”\r\nmethods onward to woman’s suffrage or direct legislation or proletarian\r\nabsolutism through Russian soviets, nor socialistic panaceas varying\r\nfrom a mild collectivism to Marxism and the _Internationale_, nor a\r\nleague of nations and an imposing but impotent “Covenant,” nor even\r\na world-wide “League to Enforce Peace.” We have heard something too\r\nmuch of late of peace, and not enough of justice; peace is not an end\r\nin itself, it is rather a by-product of justice. Through justice the\r\nworld can attain peace, but through peace there is no guaranty that\r\njustice may be achieved. There must always be the material enginery\r\nthrough the operation of which the ideal is put into practice, but in\r\nthe ideal lies the determining force, whether for good or evil, and by\r\njust so far as this is right in its nature will the mechanism operate\r\nfor good ends. The best agent in the world, even the Catholic Church or\r\nthe American Republic, may be employed towards evil and vicious ends\r\nwhenever the energizing force is of a nature that operates towards\r\ndarkness and away from the light.\r\n\r\nI have tried in “The Sins of the Fathers,” to prove that the marks of\r\ndegeneracy and constructive evil in the modernism that went to its\r\nruin during the Great War, and is now accomplishing its destiny in\r\nthe even more tragical epoch of after-the-war, are its imperialism,\r\nits materialism and its quantitative standard--that is to say, its\r\nacceptance of the gross aggregate in place of the unit of human scale,\r\nits standard of values which rejected the passion for perfection in\r\nfavour of the numerical equivalent, and its denial of spirit as a\r\nreality rather than a mere mode of material action--while the only\r\nsalvation for society is to be found in the restoration, in all things,\r\nof small human units, the testing of all things by value not bulk, and\r\nthe acceptance once more of the philosophy of sacramentalism.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible, I suppose, to develop a detailed scheme for the\r\nreconstruction of the world along certain definite lines that would\r\nbe in accordance with these principles, but the question would at\r\nonce arise, How could it be made to work? Frankly, the question is\r\nunanswerable except by a categorical negative. The nineteenth-century\r\nsuperstition that life proceeds after an inevitable system of\r\nprogressive evolution, so defiant of history, so responsible in great\r\ndegree for the many delusions that made the war not only possible but\r\ninevitable, finds few now to do it honour. The soul is not forever\r\nengaged in the graceful industry of building for itself ever more\r\nstately mansions; it is quite as frequently employed in defiling and\r\ndestroying those already built, and in substituting the hovel for\r\nthe palace. It is not even, except at infrequent intervals, desirous\r\nof improving its condition. As a whole, man is not an animal that\r\nis eager for enlightenment that it may follow after the right. At\r\ncertain crescent periods in the long process of history, when great\r\nprophets and leaders are raised up, it is forced, even against its\r\nwill, to follow after the leaders when once the prophets have been\r\nconscientiously stoned, and great and wonderful things result--Athens,\r\nRome, Byzantium, Venice, Sicily, the cities of the Middle Ages,\r\nFlanders, Elizabethan England--but the untoward exertion is its own\r\nexecutioner, and always society sinks back into some form of barbarism\r\nfrom whence all is to be begun again.\r\n\r\nNor is education--free, universal, secular and “efficient”--an\r\nuniversal panacea for this persistent disease of backsliding; it is not\r\neven a palliative or a prophylactic. The most intensive educational\r\nperiod ever known had issue in the most preposterous war in history,\r\ninitiated by the most highly and generally educated of all peoples, by\r\nthem given a new content of disgrace and savagery, and issuing at last\r\ninto Bolshevism and an obscene anarchy that would be ridiculous but\r\nfor the omnipresent horror. And the same is true both of industrialism\r\nand democracy, for both have belied the promises of their instigators\r\nand have brought in, not peace and plenty and liberty, but universal\r\nwarfare, outrageous poverty, and the tyranny of the ignorant and the\r\nunfit.\r\n\r\nBefore the revelations of war, while the curious superstitions of\r\nthe nineteenth century were still in vogue, it was widely held that\r\nevolution, education and democracy were irresistible, and that progress\r\nfrom then on must be continuous and by arithmetical if not geometrical\r\nprogression. When the war came and the revelations began to unfold\r\nthemselves, it was held with equal comprehensiveness that even if our\r\ncivilization had been an illusion, our trinity of mechanistic saviours\r\nbut a bundle of broken reeds, the war itself would prove a great\r\nregenerative agency, and that out of its fiery purgation would issue\r\nforth a new spirit that would redeem the world. It is a fair question\r\nto ask whether those that once saw this bow of promise in the red skies\r\nhave found the gold at the rainbow’s end or are now even sure the\r\nradiance itself has not faded into nothingness.\r\n\r\nEvery great war exhibits at least two phenomena following on from\r\nits end: the falling back into an abyss of meanness, materialism and\r\nself-seeking, with the swift disappearance of the spiritual exaltation\r\ndeveloped during the fight, and the emergence sooner or later of\r\nisolated personalities who have retained the ardour of spiritual\r\nregeneration, who seem indeed to epitomize it within themselves,\r\nand who struggle, sometimes with success, sometimes with failure, to\r\nbring the mass of people back to their lost ideals and embody these\r\nin a better type of society. Apparently success or failure depends on\r\nwhether the particular war in question came on the rise or the fall of\r\nthe rhythmical curve that conditions all history.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment the first of these two phenomena has shown\r\nitself. Whether it is in Russia or in the fragments of the despoiled\r\nCentral Empires where the ominous horror of Bolshevism riots in a\r\ncarnival of obscene destruction, or in the governments and “interests”\r\nand amongst the peoples of the Allies, there is now, corporately, no\r\nevidence of anything but a general break-down of ideals, and either an\r\naccelerating plunge into something a few degrees worse than barbarism,\r\nwith the Dark Ages as its inevitable issue, or an equally fatal return\r\nto the altogether hopeless, indeed the pestilential, standards and\r\nmethods of the fruition of modernism in the world-before-the-war. The\r\nnew warfare is between these, the malignant old Two Alternatives; fear\r\nof one encompasses the other, and in each case all that is done is\r\nwith the terror of Bolshevism conditioning all on the one hand, terror\r\nof reactionism on the other. Expediency, desperate self-preservation,\r\nis the controlling passion, and the principles of justice, right and\r\nreason are no longer operative.\r\n\r\nAs this is written there is no sure indication as to which of these\r\nalternatives is to prevail, but it is for the moment quite clearly\r\nindicated that it will be the one or the other,--either the tyranny\r\nof the degraded, Bolshevism, universal anarchy, with the modernist\r\nreversal of all values succeeded by the post-modernist destruction\r\nof all values, or the triumph of reaction, with a return to the\r\nworld-before-the-war for a brief period of profligate excess along\r\nall materialistic, intellectual and scientific lines not unlike the\r\nRestoration period of Charles II, with the same ruin achieved in the\r\nend though after a certain interlude. And yet the third alternative\r\nis theoretically possible: escape from the Scylla and Charybdis of\r\nerror through the opportune development of the second phenomenon, the\r\nreasonable certainty of which is indicated by history--the appearance\r\nof those leaders of vision and power who had been generated through\r\nthe alchemy of war.\r\n\r\nThat in the end they will come we need not doubt, but in the meantime\r\nan errant world, leaderless and ungoverned, is urged swiftly on towards\r\ncatastrophe of either one sort or another, nor will it wait the coming\r\nof the indispensable leaders. It is not from the men whose potential\r\ngreatness was perfected and revealed by war, Cardinal Mercier, for\r\nexample, or Marshal Foch, great leaders absolutely of the first\r\nclass, that solution is to be sought, for in their age is sufficient\r\ninhibition. It is rather from those whose character has actually\r\nbeen made by war, youths perhaps, who have fought and found, either\r\nin the armies or the navies or in the air, or even in some of the\r\nnon-combatant branches of the Service. Boys they are now, perhaps, in\r\nyears, but into them has been poured the energizing power that leads to\r\nmastership; to them is given the first fire of progressive revelation.\r\nSomewhere, in the still active units, on the way back to their homes\r\nand to civil life, or already mingled in the activities from which they\r\nwere called for their great testing, are those who sooner or later\r\nwill find themselves the leaders of the quest for a new life for the\r\nworld. The Divine finger-touch has been granted them, the spark of\r\ninspiration has lightened in their souls, but seldom is the generation\r\nswift; it may be years before it is effected, and meanwhile only the\r\nTwo Alternatives remain.\r\n\r\nFor my own purpose in this book, perhaps indeed so far as society\r\nitself is concerned, it is a matter of indifference which is the\r\nvictor in the fight for supremacy; the ultimate issue will be the\r\nsame though the roads are various. Universal beastliness issuant of\r\nRussia, or universal materialism _redivivus_, the conditions of life\r\nwill be intolerable, and in the end a new thing will be built up as\r\ndifferent on the one hand to anarchy as on the other it is different\r\nto the industrial-democratic-materialist _régime_ of the immediate\r\npast. With the former we are assured some five hundred years not unlike\r\nthose that followed the fall of Rome; with the latter we at least are\r\ngiven the respite of a brief Restoration, during which the war-bred\r\npotencies may mature, and at the end of the few gross years which would\r\nbe allotted to this _status quo ante_-civilization, become operative\r\nto avert the horror of a recrudescent Bolshevism. At least so we\r\nmay hope; on the other hand it may be doubted whether, after all, a\r\nrevived and intensified materialism such as that which the reactionary\r\nelement is attempting, would not afford an even less favourable and\r\nstimulating soil for fostering the possible war-potentialities than\r\nwould red anarchy, for the suffocating qualities of gross luxuriance\r\nare sometimes more fatal than the desperate sensations of danger,\r\nadversity and shame. In any case, the immediate future is not one to\r\nbe anticipated with enthusiasm or confidence and we shall do well\r\nto consider the course to be followed by those who reject the Two\r\nAlternatives and refuse to have any part in either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to write another in the long list of Utopias\r\nwith which man has amused himself, from Plato to H. G. Wells. Where the\r\npreceding volumes in this series have been frankly destructive, I would\r\nmake this volume constructive, if only by suggestion. It is in no sense\r\na programme, it is still less an effort at establishing an ideal. Let\r\nus call it “a way out,” for it is no more than this; not “the” way,\r\nnor yet a way to anything approaching a perfect State, still less a\r\nperfect condition of life, but rather a possible issue out of a present\r\n_impasse_ for some of those who, as I have said, peremptorily reject\r\nboth of the intolerable alternatives now offered them.\r\n\r\nWhat I have to propose is based on acceptance, at least substantially,\r\nof the criticisms of modernism that appear in “The Nemesis of\r\nMediocrity” and in “The Sins of the Fathers”; it also assumes the\r\ngeneral accuracy of the interpretation of history attempted in\r\n“The Great Thousand Years,” and the estimate of certain historic\r\nreligio-social forces therein described. To those who dissent from\r\nthese opinions this volume will contain nothing and they will be well\r\nadvised if they pursue it no further. Since it is written for those\r\nwho have done me the honour to read these previous books, I shall not\r\ntry to epitomize them here, assuming as I do a certain familiarity\r\nwith their general argument. All that it is necessary to say is that\r\nthe assumption is made that “modern civilization” was essentially\r\nan inferior product; that it could have had no other issue than\r\nprecisely such a war as occurred; that its fundamental weaknesses\r\nwere its imperialism, its materialism and its quantitative standard;\r\nthat the particular type of “democracy” for which the world was to\r\nbe made safe was and is a menace to righteous society, since it had\r\nlowered and reversed all standards, established the reign of the\r\nvenal, the incapable and the unfit, and had destroyed all competent\r\nleadership while preventing its generation, and that the only visible\r\nhope of recovery lay in a restoration of the unit of human scale, the\r\npassion for perfection, and a certain form of philosophy known as\r\nsacramentalism, with the precedents of the monastic method used as a\r\nbasis of operation, and the whole put in process through the leadership\r\nof great captains of men such as always in the past have accomplished\r\nthe building up of society after cataclysms similar to that which\r\nduring five years has brought modernism to an end.\r\n\r\nSociety is no longer to be dealt with as an unit, nor even as a\r\ncongeries of units; it is a chaos, both as a whole and in each\r\nmoiety thereof. The evolutionary process, if it ever existed, is now\r\ninoperative, and something more nearly approaching devolution has\r\ntaken its place. As under the earlier assault of the everlasting\r\nbarbarian the great, imperial unity of Rome broke up into minute\r\nfamily fragments, and as the pseudo-unity of the Holy Roman Empire\r\nbroke up into a myriad of heterogeneous states, so our own world,\r\nboth political and social, is deliquescing into its elements, and no\r\ningenious mechanism, however cleverly devised, can arrest the process\r\nfor more than the briefest of periods. When the mechanism breaks down,\r\nwhether it is a year or ten years hence, the interrupted process of\r\ndisintegration will continue to its appointed end.\r\n\r\nMan has always nursed the dream of corporate regeneration, of the\r\nfinding or devising of some method or mechanism whereby society as\r\na whole could be redeemed _en bloc_. The dream has engendered many\r\nrevolutions but the results have been other than those anticipated,\r\nand even these unexpected happenings have proved evanescent, with a\r\nconstant return to the old evils and abuses. Persistently the world\r\nas a whole refuses regeneration. Latterly the ingenious device has\r\nsomewhat superseded the violent changing of things, and democracy with\r\nits miscellaneous spawn of doctrinaire inventions, industrialism with\r\nits facile subterfuges of political economy; evolution, education,\r\nsocialism, each in turn has offered itself as the sovereign elixir.\r\nThe war has quashed the major part, the following “peace” is dealing\r\nwith the remainder. The last device of all, socialism, whether of the\r\nMarxian variety or of the Fabian sort, is now the most discredited\r\nof all, for Bolshevism on the one hand, state ownership, control,\r\nor management of industry on the other, have both proved, the one\r\nintolerable, the other a bloody synonym for social extinction.\r\n\r\nYet the way out must be found by those for whom the present scheme of\r\nexistence is not good enough; for those who refuse to go back to the\r\npre-war _régime_ or on to the predicted era of anarchy. The way may\r\nbe found, but it will reveal itself not through wide and democratic\r\nsocial processes but through group action in which the units are few in\r\nnumber. The process will be one of withdrawal, of segregation, at first\r\neven of isolation; but if this really proves to be the right way, the\r\nend may be, as so often in the past, a centrifugal action developing\r\nfrom one originally centripetal, with an ultimate leavening of the\r\nwhole lump.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that in “The Great Thousand Years” I endeavoured\r\nto demonstrate the vibratory theory of history, whereby the life of\r\nsociety is conditioned by a rhythmical wave motion; curves rising and\r\ndescending, inflexibly though with varying trajectories, the falling\r\ncurve meeting at some point the rising curve of a future coming\r\ninto being, the crossing points forming the nodes of history, and\r\nspacing themselves at five-century intervals either side the birth\r\nof Christ, or the year 1 A.D. In the same place I called attention to\r\nthe correspondence in time (since the Christian era) between certain\r\nperiodic manifestations of spiritual force, identical in nature though\r\nsomewhat varied in fashion, and these nodal points; that is to say,\r\nthe monastic idea as this showed itself in the first, sixth, eleventh\r\nand sixteenth centuries. This synchronism may be graphically explained\r\nthus, the thin line indicating the approximate curve of social\r\ndevelopment, the shaded line the monastic manifestation:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A THE CURVE OF CIVILIZATION B THE CURVE OF MONASTICISM]\r\n\r\nIt would appear from this that now, while the next nodal point is\r\npossibly seventy-five years in the future, the next manifestations of\r\nmonasticism should already be showing itself. The curve of modernism\r\nis now descending as precipitously as did that of Roman Imperialism,\r\nbut already, to those who are willing to see, there are indisputable\r\nevidences of the rising of the following curve. Whether this is to\r\nemulate in lift and continuance the curves of Mediævalism and of\r\nmodernism, or whether it is to be but a poor copy of the sag and the\r\nlow, heavy lift of the Dark Ages, is the question that man is to\r\ndetermine for himself during the next two generations.\r\n\r\nNow as a matter of fact the last thirty years have shown an altogether\r\nastonishing recrudescence of the monastic spirit, while already the war\r\nhas added enormously to its force and expansion. Thus far it has been\r\nwholly along old-established lines, which was to be expected; but as we\r\napproach nearer and nearer to the next nodal point of the year 2000,\r\nwe are bound to see a variant, a new expression of the indestructible\r\nidea. This has always been the case. At the beginning of the Christian\r\nera the impulse was personal, the individual was the unit, and the\r\nresult was the anchorites and hermits, each isolating himself in a\r\nhidden mountain cave, a hut in the desert or, if his fancy took this\r\neccentric, on the top of a lonely column, like St. Simon Stylites.\r\nWith St. Benedict the group became the unit, a sort of artificial\r\nfamily either of men or of women, as the case might be. He himself\r\nbegan as a hermit in the cleft of a far mountain, but within his own\r\nlifetime his original impulse was overridden and the new communal\r\nor group life came into being, though each monastery or convent was\r\nquite autonomous and self-contained. Five centuries later (or four,\r\nto speak more exactly) began the Cluniac reform, which was followed\r\nby the Cistercian movement, and here, though the old Benedictine mode\r\nwas followed at first, in a brief time came the differentiation, for\r\nnow all the houses of one order were united under a centralizing and\r\ncoördinating force. Here we have the State as the parallel of the new\r\nscheme. Latest of all, in another five centuries, came still a new model,\r\nthe army, with the Society of Jesus as its perfect exponent. So we have\r\nat almost exact five-century intervals four models of monasticism: the\r\nindividual, the family, the State and the army. A fifth is now due; what\r\nwill be its form?\r\n\r\nIt will, I think, be one in which the human family is made the unit. It\r\nwill not supersede the older modes but supplement them, for the monks,\r\ncanons-regular and friars, of the old tradition and the old line, will\r\nbe as necessary then as ever; instead it will be an amplification\r\nof the indestructible idea, fitted to, and developing from, the new\r\nconditions which confront society. In addition to the groups of either\r\nmen or women, living in a community life apart, and vowed to poverty,\r\ncelibacy and obedience, there will be groups of natural families,\r\nfather, mother and children, entering into a communal but not by any\r\nmeans “communistic” life, within those Walled Towns they will create\r\nfor themselves, in the midst of the world but not of it, where the\r\nconditions of life will be determined after such sort as will make\r\npossible that real and wholesome and joyful and simple and reasonable\r\nliving that has long been forbidden by the conditions of modern\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nLet me explain at once that I have nothing in mind resembling in the\r\nleast the communistic schemes of Fourier, Owen, George; of the Shakers,\r\nthe Concord enthusiasts or their ilk. In these cases it was always\r\nthe unnatural element of communism that was their undoing, and in\r\nthe Walled Towns of the new era the preservation of individuality,\r\nof private property, of family integrity, would be of necessity a\r\nfundamental principle. Many evils and abuses have grown up around all\r\nthese, but I cannot claim that I am one of those (in spite of its wide\r\npopularity and almost universal acceptance) who hold tenaciously to\r\nthe belief that the only way to get rid of the dust is to burn down\r\nthe house, or that the only way to correct a child’s faults is to kill\r\nit. Rather I incline to the somewhat outworn method of reform without\r\ndestruction, and I lean to the opinion that there are enough others\r\nof like convictions to make possible the creation of a certain number\r\nof Walled Towns that the experiment may be put into effect, since\r\nmanifestly it is no longer possible in society as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe method would be simple, the process carried out quietly, and\r\npreferably in several places at once. A certain community of interest\r\nmust be presupposed, but this would hardly extend beyond substantial\r\nunity in religion, in philosophy and in a revolt against the\r\nindustrial-democratic-imperialist scheme of society which has dominated\r\nEurope and America since the beginning of the nineteenth-century.\r\nThere can be no sane and wholesome society in the future where there\r\nis not an universally accepted religion of perfectly definite form, a\r\nclear, logical and convincing philosophy of life, and a social system\r\ndiametrically opposed to that which was current before the war and is\r\nnow striving desperately for a restoration. As the unity of religion\r\nhas been shattered since the sixteenth century, the creators of the\r\nWalled Towns may very well be divided into individual groups, so far\r\nas religion is concerned. I can imagine Roman Catholics forming the\r\nnucleus of one, Episcopalians another, and it may be there are among\r\nthe Protestant denominations those who would be led along the same\r\nlines. The essential point is the fundamental necessity for a vital and\r\ncommon religion among those who go forward to the building of the new\r\nsocial units. The same is true of philosophy, for this and religion can\r\nnever be separated except under pain of the results that have followed\r\nthe severance in the fifteenth century, and the workings of a world\r\nvoid of any real philosophy ever since. If there is any philosophy\r\nexcept sacramentalism which is at the same time intellectually\r\nsatisfying in a perfectly complete degree, consonant with the proved\r\nresults of scientific investigation and thought, and sufficiently\r\ndynamic as a controlling force in life, I am not acquainted with it. If\r\nsuch a thing exists, it might serve its turn, but false philosophies\r\nsuch as materialism, evolutionism, Christian Science and pragmatism\r\nare not working substitutes for a real philosophy such as that of\r\nHugh of St. Victor, Duns Scotus or St. Thomas Aquinas. As for the\r\nsocial vision, there must be not only the negative quality of revolt\r\nbut the positive quality of construction. It is not sufficient to\r\nhate the tawdry and iniquitous fabrications of the camp-followers of\r\ndemocracy; the gross industrial-financial system of “big business”\r\nand competition, with the capital _versus_ labour antithesis it has\r\nbred. It is not enough to curse imperialism and materialism and the\r\nquantitative standard. There must be some vision of the plausible\r\nsubstitute, and while this must determine itself slowly, through many\r\nfailures, and will in the end appear as a by-product of the spiritual\r\nregeneration that must follow once the real religion and a right\r\nphilosophy are achieved, there must be a starting somewhere.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I should say that for this starting point we might fix on\r\nJustice (whichever way the sword cuts) as the first consideration;\r\nCharity (or rather _Caritas_--the Latin is more exact) follows close\r\nafter, or even goes side by side. So do the other Cardinal Virtues; but\r\nwho has not invoked them in support of every reform, whether it was of\r\nGod or the devil? They fall as lightly from the lips of Marat or Lenine\r\nas from those of Plato, Dante or Sir Thomas More; they may be assumed.\r\nThere are, however, certain less abstract propositions which it seems\r\nto me must serve at least as a trial basis; these, for example:\r\n\r\nPower is Divine in its origin, since it is an attribute of Divinity,\r\nand its exercise is by Divine permission. It follows, therefore, that,\r\nas was held during the Middle Ages, no man or group of men, neither\r\nking nor boss nor parliament nor soviet, has any authority to exercise\r\npower after a wrong fashion or to govern ill.\r\n\r\nSociety exists through coöperation, not through competition; the latter\r\nmust therefore be abolished, though this does not imply the destruction\r\nof emulation, which is quite a different thing.\r\n\r\nAll men are equal before God and the Law but not otherwise.\r\nPrivilege, in the sense of immunity or of special opportunity without\r\ncorresponding obligations is abhorrent, but justice, self-interest and\r\nthe common good demand that those who _can_ do a thing well should do\r\nit, those who cannot should be debarred. This applies to government or\r\nlegislation or the exercise of the electoral franchise, as well as to\r\neducation, medicine or the arts.\r\n\r\nIn industry of all kinds, production should be for use, not profit. The\r\npaying of money for the use of money is questionable, both from the\r\nstandpoint of morals and of expediency. It may prove that the Church\r\nwas right during the Middle Ages in calling it all _usury_, and that\r\nJohn Calvin, when he declared in its favour, was guilty of a crime.\r\nIn any case, the return on capital should be the fixed charge and\r\nsmall in amount; the margin of profit belongs to those who produce,\r\nwhether they work with their brains or their hands. The holding of\r\nland for dwelling and cultivation is essential for every family in any\r\nwholesome society; this land should be sufficient to support the family\r\nat necessity. Land belongs to the community, but tenure thereof on\r\nthe part of families or individuals is perpetual, and the land may be\r\nbequeathed or transferred so long as the rent or taxes are duly paid.\r\n\r\nEvery community is in duty bound to guard its own integrity by\r\ndetermining its own membership, but none once admitted can be expelled\r\nexcept by process of law.\r\n\r\nNo society can endure when a false standard of comparative values\r\nexists. At the present time about half the working male population in\r\nEurope and America is engaged in producing or marketing things which\r\nadd nothing to the virtue, the real welfare, or the joy in life of man,\r\nand for the most part he would be better off without them. There are as\r\nmany directly or indirectly engaged in getting rid of these essentially\r\nuseless products as there are in their manufacture. None of these men\r\nproduces anything, and they must be fed, housed and clothed by those\r\nwho do. It costs as much to market the surplus product as it does to\r\nbring it into existence, and the consumer pays. The result is that\r\n“labour-saving” machines have vastly increased the burden of labour;\r\nthe surplus product demands markets, and exploitation both of labour\r\nand of markets becomes the foundation of industrial civilization. The\r\nmodern world has become a perfectly artificial fabric of complicated\r\nindebtedness, the magnitude and ramifications of which are so enormous\r\nthat nothing preserves it but public confidence. Were this removed, or\r\neven shaken seriously, the whole fabric would collapse in universal\r\nbankruptcy, a situation even now indicated for all Europe, as may be\r\nseen in Mr. Vanderlip’s remarkable book “What has Happened to Europe.”\r\nIt is to correct this silly artifice, to obliterate this preposterous,\r\nwrong-headed and insecure way of life, that sooner or later men, women\r\nand children will seek refuge in the Walled Towns they will build, as\r\nthey have gone, time out of mind, into the monasteries and convents of\r\nreligion which they built for their earlier refuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the vision that I see of the coming Walled Towns, they may rise\r\nanywhere, given only that there is sufficient arable land near by, a\r\nriver that will afford power, and a site with some elements of natural\r\nbeauty. They will grow from small beginnings,--a few families and\r\nindividuals at first, though the number must be sufficient to establish\r\nthe identity and the autonomy of the group. The members will be those\r\nfor whom the present type of social life is not good enough, either in\r\nfact or in promise; men and women who think alike on a few essential\r\nmatters, who still maintain the standard of comparative values of the\r\nworld before modernism, and who wish to live simply, as happily as\r\npossible, and to restore the lost ideals of justice, honour, chivalry\r\nand brotherly coöperation. While fulfilling all their obligations to\r\ngovernment as it is now established--paying taxes, rendering military\r\nservice and jury duty, and voting in those occasional cases when there\r\nis a remote chance of its doing any good--they will yet set up for\r\nthemselves a community, self-supporting in so far as this is possible,\r\nwith its own government, its educational system, its social organism\r\nand its regulations controlling the mode of life of its members to the\r\nextent that is necessary to carry out the fundamental principles of the\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nThe phrase “Walled Towns” is symbolical only; it does not imply the\r\ngreat ramparts of masonry with machicolated towers, moats, drawbridges\r\nand great city gates such as once guarded the beautiful cities of the\r\nMiddle Ages. It might, of course; there is no reason why a city should\r\nnot so protect itself from the world without, if its fancy led in this\r\npictorial direction; and after all, anyone who has been so fortunate\r\nas to live for a time in an ancient walled town, even under modernism,\r\nknows how potent is the psychological force of grey, guarding walls,\r\nwith the little city within, and beyond the gates not only the fields\r\nand orchards and vineyards as they were in the old days, but also,\r\nand kept aloof by the ancient walls, the railways and factories of\r\nan inclement modernism. No, the adjective is symbolical merely, and\r\nindicates the fact that around these communities there is drawn a\r\ndefinite inhibition that absolutely cuts off from the town itself and\r\n“all they that dwell therein” those things from the assault of which\r\nrefuge has been sought. I could easily imagine that these inhibitions\r\nmight vary more or less as between one Walled Town and another,\r\nalthough certain general principles would be preserved everywhere,\r\nsince these would be implied in the very movement itself.\r\n\r\nHere are certain examples of what I mean. The antithesis between\r\ncapital and labour would be impossible. Some form of a restored guild\r\nsystem would be the only workable basis. Production would be normally\r\nfor use, not profit; and advertising or exploitation of any kind, or\r\nany other form of “creating markets,” would be rigidly tabooed. Every\r\nfamily would hold land sufficient for its own maintenance so far\r\nas possible farm and garden products are concerned. Certain large,\r\nexpensive machines, by their nature not always in use, would be owned\r\nby the community, while the transportation of surplus produce to\r\noutside markets, the maintenance of a dairy and a canning plant,\r\npossibly also a mill and bakery, would be communally undertaken.\r\nAs joyful living through that simplicity which follows from the\r\nelimination of unwholesome desires is a fundamental principle, it\r\nfollows that in every case there would be a revival of the old\r\nprinciple of sumptuary laws, certain things being excluded as vicious\r\nin themselves, others as poisoning in their influence. Of course\r\nthere is great danger here, since there is the constant menace of a\r\npernicious infringement on that personal liberty which is an essential\r\nof all right living. The fact is incontestable, however, that our\r\npresent intolerable social condition which seems to focus at one\r\npoint in the “high cost of living” is due to two things: first, the\r\nmultiplication during the last forty years of an incalculable number\r\nof foolish luxuries and “amenities of life” we were far happier\r\nwithout, but which now through familiarity we look on as indispensable;\r\nsecond, the fact I already have referred to that more than half the\r\nlabour expended today goes to produce utterly useless, grossly ugly,\r\nor vitiatingly luxurious commodities, while half the cost of this\r\nridiculous mass of superfluities goes to the tout, the drummer, the\r\ntradesman and the advertiser. In some way the balance must be restored,\r\nand this can be accomplished partly by regulations formally set forth,\r\npartly by the moral force of a better type of life actually put in\r\nprocess and exerting its silent influence over the people themselves.\r\nTo a great extent it would be a case of “local option” extended to\r\nmore than the question of drink. It would be neither useful nor wise\r\n(indeed it might be actionable) for me to attempt a list of the things\r\nwe should be better off without. Each one can make his list to suit\r\nhimself, and he will be surprised, if he deals with the question\r\nfrankly, at the length of the schedule.\r\n\r\nThere is no way in which life can be brought back to a sane\r\nand wholesome and noble basis except through the recovery of a\r\nright religion and a right philosophy, the establishing of a new\r\nindustrial and commercial system as radically opposed to the\r\ninsanities of Bolshevism as it is to the sinister efficiency of the\r\ncapitalist-proletarian _régime_, and by the elimination of the\r\nuseless and crushing impedimenta that have been heaped upon us by\r\n“labour-saving” machines, the craft and ingenuity of misguided\r\ninventors, and the monumental ability of the system of advertising.\r\nWithin the deadly coil of life as it is now irrevocably fixed by the\r\nsociety of today, there is no possibility of escape (barring the\r\nthreatened success of Marxian socialism as this has taken shape in\r\ninternationalism and Bolshevism), for the individual is helpless,\r\nbound hand and foot by the forces of custom, public opinion, lethargy\r\nand luxury, and by what Dr. Jacks so well calls “the tyranny of mere\r\nthings.” So the real men felt in the time of St. Benedict, and of St.\r\nOdo of Cluny and St. Robert of Molesmes, of St. Norbert and St. Francis\r\nand St. Dominic and St. Bruno. They left the world in order that they\r\nmight regain it, even though their eyes were fixed on a heavenly\r\ncountry. For themselves and their followers they gained a better type\r\nof life than the world could then offer, and their deeds lived after\r\nthem in centuries of a regenerated life.\r\n\r\nIt is our habit of mind to think of the period of decline and\r\ncatastrophe that intervenes between one era and the next as something\r\nawful and ominous, when the whole world realizes the horror of change\r\nand is sunk in black despair. In this we are undoubtedly as wrong as\r\nwe are in the case of our interpretation of history. St. Augustine\r\nand St. Jerome saw the significance of the fall of the Roman Empire,\r\nbut such other documentary evidence as exists would indicate that the\r\nRomans as a whole took it much as a matter of course, with little\r\nsense of the vastness of the catastrophe and the plenitude of the\r\nhumiliation. In the ninth century men were so steeped in the universal\r\nsin and corruption they ceased to retain any perspective whatever.\r\nVery likely while Marozia and her clan were turning Rome and the\r\nChurch into a monstrous offence against decency, the general public,\r\nas well as the world-wide corrupting influences themselves, thought\r\nthat their “civilization” was really not so bad after all. The same is\r\ntrue of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when the beginnings\r\nof the Renaissance dazzled man’s eyes to the tragedy of the ending\r\nof Mediævalism and the fast growing profligacy in act and thought.\r\nWe ourselves are in similar case. We are so near the events that\r\nare bringing modernism to an end that we can estimate them not at\r\nall in their true nature. Read any newspaper of today, talk with any\r\n“practical business man,” or indeed almost any clergyman, educator or\r\nprofessed “philosopher,” and you will find the attitude of mind that\r\nlooks on the war and the current beginnings of social revolution as\r\nuntoward episodes, the insane creations of froward men, that only need\r\ntime and patience for the crushing, to permit the world to go on again\r\njust as before, only faster and more gloriously, towards the iridescent\r\napotheosis of democratic politics, imperial business, scientific\r\nacquisition, and the reign of reason. The incubus of the thing-that-is\r\ncannot be shifted and, as so many times before, it is only ruthless\r\ncatastrophe that can bring it to an end.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we do not realize how new a thing is this tyranny of the\r\nmaterial product, this obsession of the machine and the things it\r\nproduces, the ideas and habits and superstitions it generates. I am\r\nnot so old a man, as lives run, but I can still remember the old\r\npatriarchal life of the New England countryside before the juggernaut\r\nthat crushed wholesome society and sane living had begun its fatal\r\ncourse. In the year 1880, when I first knew a great city, there were\r\nonly three forces then in operation which differentiated its growth\r\nthat had not existed in the time of Cæsar--steam as power, the electric\r\ntelegraph and the elevator, the last a novelty of less than ten years’\r\nexistence. The great forces that were to transform society had been in\r\nexistence for varying periods: some from the Renaissance, some from the\r\nReformation, some from the Civil Wars in England, some from the French\r\nRevolution, some from the mechanical discoveries between 1767 and 1830,\r\nsome from our own Civil War. It is not until the latter date, however,\r\nthat they became fully operative; and the incubus we would now remove,\r\nif we could, and if we fully realized its nature, is actually the\r\ncreation of the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nI have said above that I clearly remember the old _régime_ as it stood\r\nat the opening of this fifty-year period of monstrous aggregation,\r\nexaggeration and acceleration, and this memory, together with some\r\nthirty years of study of Mediæval civilization, has much to do with\r\nthe conviction that man cannot be free or sane or reasonably happy\r\nuntil he forcibly tears himself (or forcibly is torn) from the deadly\r\nevil of modernism in which he is enmeshed. The positive memory may help\r\nto show something of that to which I conceive we must return.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1870 my grandfather’s place was to all intents and purposes\r\nwhat it had been since the first portion of the old house was built\r\nduring the reign of William and Mary. He was “The Squire” in his\r\nfamily and over the community, as his fathers had been before him for\r\ntwo centuries. If wills were to be drawn, land surveyed, property\r\ntransferred, family quarrels adjusted, the duty fell upon him. From\r\na material point of view the house and the farm and the way of life\r\nwere as they had been. There was, I think, a mechanical corn-sheller,\r\nbut I remember no other new-fangled mechanical device. The wheat for\r\nflour was grown on the place and ground at a near-by mill. Until but\r\na few years before, the wool and flax for clothing and linen were\r\nalso of home production, while the great loom was still in its place\r\nin the dim attic with its odour of thyme and beeswax. In addition\r\nto all the necessary fruits and vegetables, all the butter, cheese,\r\nbacon, hams came from the estate. So of course did the honey and the\r\nmetheglyn, or honey-wine as you read of it in Chaucer, which, I verily\r\nbelieve, was made there last of all places in the world. To a great\r\nextent the life was still communal. For mowing, planting, harvesting,\r\nshearing, husking, the farmers came together to work in common, while\r\nthe disability of one brought the others together to do his work.\r\nCommunal also in a sense was the household. Many a time have I awakened\r\nas a boy, between lavender-scented homespun sheets, and beneath a\r\nwonderful woven coverlet, to dress in the early dawn and go down to the\r\nlong kitchen with its eight-foot fireplace, to find all the feminine\r\nportion of the household preparing such a breakfast as the present\r\nday cannot afford; and later I have watched the neighbors gathered in\r\nthe “east room” ingeniously “drawing in” rugs and mats of marvellous\r\n(if not strictly artistic) design and colour. As was the custom in\r\nthat country, the house was double, the eldest son occupying the new\r\nwing until in time he removed to the old part and his son in turn\r\ntook the new. It was a place of tradition, of immemorial custom, of\r\nself-respecting because arduous life, and every inch of ancient house,\r\nof vast and rambling barns, even of the fields and pastures, gardens\r\nand orchards and woodland, was redolent of old history, of permanence,\r\nof stability, of dignity and of a vivid liberty.\r\n\r\nHere was no telephone, no automobile, no elaborate collection of\r\ncomplicated and costly machines, no flood of cheap newspapers,\r\nmagazines or other “literature,” no weekly expedition to the “movies,”\r\nno ready-made clothes that must be constantly replaced or that annually\r\nwent out of fashion, no pianola or graphophone, no “art-furniture,” no\r\ncandy and cheap drinks and fruit out-of-season. Neither was there any\r\nlabour problem, or strikes or poverty or high-cost-of-living.\r\n\r\n“A hard life”? Yes, in a way, but its hardness was more than balanced\r\nby what it gave: self-respect, liberty, freedom from the tyranny and\r\noppression of outside forces; above all, _character_, and of a strength\r\nand simplicity and fineness it would be hard to match today. I do not\r\ndoubt that country and village life as it was then in the North, and\r\nhad been in the South until ten years before (not as it had become in\r\nanother twenty years when the new forces had begun to seep in), was\r\nmore productive of real happiness and of sterling character than has\r\nbeen any form of life that has developed since.\r\n\r\nOf course there was the other side to the case. Life then, good as\r\nit was, lacked some of the qualities that existed in the Middle\r\nAges, the loss of which was a serious handicap. There was a hard and\r\nunlovely religion, the arts had wholly disappeared, and the exquisite\r\nenvironment man had always made for himself had vanished from life. The\r\nstimulus and the vital communal sense of the old guilds, the games,\r\nthe merrymaking, the living religious practices, had faded into a\r\ncolder and more austere neighbourliness. The comradeship of pilgrimage\r\nand common adventure and “church ales” had vanished utterly, and in\r\nevery way life was becoming more drab and colourless. Much remained,\r\nhowever, though in a vanishing estate, of the clean and simple and\r\nwholesome life of a dead past, and in comparison with the common life\r\nof today, on the farm, in the factory, in village or great city, it\r\nmust commend itself in such degree that many sacrifices are worth while\r\nif we can win it back. Win it back, but not as it stood then. Out of\r\na farther past must come many things to enrich its content and make\r\nmore beautiful its condition. Out of the present must come much also.\r\nAn archæological or artificial restoration would be as undesirable as\r\nit is impossible. What modernism has given--or sold--that is in itself\r\ngood, must be retained, and this is much. The trouble is the good is\r\nso intricately mixed with the bad that the untangling seems almost\r\nhopeless. Since our standard of comparative values is so distorted we\r\nhave no sound basis from which we can set to work. Only through the\r\nprocess of what is really a new spiritual enlightenment, manifesting\r\nitself through both religion and philosophy, can the task be\r\naccomplished, for no ingenious engine, no clever device, no political\r\npanacea will prove even of temporary value. Probably the control of\r\nthis spiritual stimulus is out of our hands; it usually is, being\r\ngranted to men at times, at other times withheld. While we await the\r\nissue we can at least try humbly, and perhaps doubtfully, if we cannot\r\ntake the first steps towards earning the indispensable boon, and it may\r\nbe the first step will be into Walled Towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBeaulieu is a Walled Town and it lies about forty miles from one of the\r\nlargest cities of New England. The forty-mile road is in all things\r\nabout what such a road is today; the same industrial suburbs, with\r\nthe further fringe of slate-grey tenements in their dreary and dirty\r\nyards, then the subsidiary towns of dull or flamboyant cottages, barren\r\nrailway stations, third-rate shops, harsh factories, each separated\r\nfrom the next by marshes or barrens where refuse is dumped, and\r\nspeculative roads and house-lots cry their unsavoury wares. Little by\r\nlittle decent residences crop up and so the ring of reasonable opulence\r\nis reached,--now as then good so far as nature is let alone, bad where\r\nthe architect and landscapist and gardener exercise their ingenuity.\r\nFarms follow, and pasture and woodland, unkempt but inoffensive,\r\nsometimes even beautiful when the hand of man has been withheld.\r\nThree or four ambitious and growing towns break the good country,\r\neach contributing of its own in the shape of mills, slums, wastes,\r\ncommercial architecture, gaudy signs, hurry, noise, dust and bad\r\nsmells. After the last there is an interval of comparative quiet and\r\ndecency while the road runs through a respectable forest, rising as it\r\nenters among low hills, with a glimpse of water here and there, a small\r\nlake, a brook, and at last a fairly wide view.\r\n\r\nOn the bridge the view changes. There is something different in the\r\nlands beyond, though the difference is at first intangible. It is\r\nfarming land for some two or three miles in front and reaching in a\r\nwide sweep right and left, while beyond the land rises swiftly with a\r\nrather thick growth of large trees above which lift two or three grey\r\nstone towers, and a silvery spire, very delicate and lofty; a view that\r\nmight be in any English county or in France or the Rhineland. The farms\r\nare evidently under high cultivation, divided into rather small fields\r\nby hedgerows marked by an unusual number of well-kept trees. There\r\nare few farmhouses but many large barns of stone somewhat suggesting\r\nthose of western Pennsylvania. Such houses as there are, are also\r\nof stone in great part, with brick here and there and considerable\r\nwhite plaster. The well-built road is, as before, crowded with motor\r\nvehicles, but two things have wholly ceased at the river--advertising\r\nsigns and smoking factory chimney; as far as the eye can see neither is\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThe zone of farms is quickly passed and then comes a space of orchards\r\nand vineyards; the highway divides, one branch to the right, another\r\nto the left, and at the fork stands a stone shrine with the figure of\r\nSt. Christopher; practically all the motors go to the right, but we\r\ntake the road to the left, which curves sharply after a few hundred\r\nyards, crosses a stone bridge of a single arch over a narrow but swift\r\nriver, and is intercepted by a long, irregular mass of stone buildings\r\nwith many mullioned windows, and a lofty tower something like that of\r\nSt. John’s College in Cambridge, with a broad, high, pointed arch, and\r\na chain reaching from side to side, blocking the way to all wheeled\r\ntraffic. This is the Bar Gate of the Walled Town of Beaulieu, and here\r\nall automobiles must stop, for they are not permitted within the town.\r\nThere is a good garage on one side; a sort of inn and a livery stable\r\non the other, where one may hire a carriage or saddle horses, which\r\nalone are allowed inside the gates.\r\n\r\nThe rambling grey-stone building, which in parts rises sheer from the\r\nriver’s edge and is not unlike Warwick Castle, serves many purposes.\r\nThe octroi is strict and all goods brought into the town for sale\r\nmust pay a varying _ad valorem_ tax, while the “liberty of the town”\r\nis granted to outsiders only on payment of a small fee. No one can\r\nsell in the town without a license, while some things are wholly\r\nprohibited, such, for example, as those things that would compete with\r\nnative products, whether of food-stuffs, manufacture or artisanship,\r\nand those articles which the town has prohibited as deleterious or as\r\n“useless luxuries.” A bailiff and council of three sit here in a fine\r\nstone-vaulted room opening off the great gate, for three hours each\r\nmorning, to issue their licenses or prohibitions. Here also are the\r\ntown telephones and telegraphs, for while these as well as motor cars\r\nare recognized as necessities on emergency occasions, they are held to\r\nbe “useless luxuries” as private possessions and are forbidden within\r\nthe walls. There is nothing to prevent a townsman owning and using\r\na motor car or private telephone beyond the town walls, if he likes,\r\nthough this is looked on with disfavour, and as a matter of fact is\r\nunusual. In the early days of this, as of all Walled Towns, and to some\r\nextent thereafter, those who became townsmen continued their business\r\nor professions “in the world outside the walls,” that is to say in\r\nsome neighboring city, and the jurisdiction of the Walled Town did not\r\nextend beyond its own precincts and lands. Usually in a few years’\r\ntime these men adapted themselves to the town life and law, giving up\r\ntheir outside interests and becoming “Burgesses of the Free City” with\r\ntheir interests and material activities concentrated within its limits.\r\nConduct of government is wholly within the hands of these burgesses.\r\nAs for the town telephones and motor cars, their use is free to all\r\ntownsmen in cases of illness or other recognized emergency.\r\n\r\nOver the gate-tower floats the big banner of the town, above the arch\r\nis its coat of arms emblazoned in colour and gold, and within the\r\ngate are always two halberdiers on guard. This is not affectation\r\nor a wilful mediævalism, but because all the Walled Towns know the\r\nvalue of symbolism and use it universally and intelligently. All civic\r\nceremonials, indeed all the common acts of the town officials, are\r\ncarried out with much show and dignity and magnificence. There are\r\nfine robes of office, precise etiquette, elaborate functions; nothing\r\nis done casually or haphazard, but with dignity, beauty and a real\r\npride in the nobility of the communal life. Long before the founding\r\nof the first Walled Town it was generally known that the depravity,\r\nor at least the incompetence, that had become chronic in civic life,\r\nwas partially due to the false “democracy” which had shorn it of every\r\nvestige of dignity, of ceremonial, of difference from the common\r\naffairs of business life, and the potency of symbolism was one of the\r\noriginal elements in the great revolution which brought the Walled\r\nTowns into existence.\r\n\r\nPassing now under the great echoing vault of the Bar Gate, we come at\r\nonce into the town itself. There is first of all a small square or\r\nmarket-place with rather thickly set, stone-built and gabled house,\r\nwith glimpses between, and through occasional archways, into gardens\r\nbehind. On one side is the Exchange, a considerable building with an\r\nopen arcade along its front; it is here that the surplus products\r\nof the town are sold--grain and farm produce, cloth, or whatever it\r\nmay be that is paid through the tax in kind or placed in the hands\r\nof the Exchange officials for sale outside the community. The main\r\nstreet leads from the square and curves up a slight grade. Here the\r\nhouses are well separated, with garden walls between, sometimes\r\npierced by grated openings that give more glimpses of gardens around\r\nand behind. As in the old days, these houses are mostly workshops\r\nand salesrooms as well as residences, for this is the street of\r\ncraftsmen of all sorts--workers in metals, wood, leather; potters,\r\nembroiderers, tailors; carvers in stone, painters, makers of musical\r\ninstruments. Every craft and art that is needed by the townspeople\r\nis found here, for one of the foundation stones of the Walled Towns\r\nis self-sufficiency; that is to say, everything ordinarily needful\r\nis produced by the town for the town, the necessities that cannot be\r\nfurnished because of physical and climatic difficulties being reduced\r\nto the smallest number. Coffee and tea, a few spices, tropical fruits,\r\nrice, tobacco, cotton, silk and certain wines are beyond the contriving\r\nof a Walled Town in the north temperate zone and must be imported; but\r\nthis is done by town officials, who are paid salaries, and the goods\r\nare resold at a standard advance on the wholesale cost. Everything\r\nthat is possible is produced within the town itself, and either by\r\nindividual craftsmen or, where bulk products are necessary, in the\r\nworkshops maintained by the community under the charge of a special and\r\nsalaried group of officials.\r\n\r\nThe specialization and localizing of industries and the division of\r\nlabour were two of the causes of industrial civilization--and still\r\nare in “the world without.” That one town or district should be given\r\nover to the weaving of cotton or the spinning of wool; that shoes\r\nshould chiefly be produced in Lynn, furniture in Grand Rapids, glass in\r\nPittsburgh, beer in Milwaukee, hams in Chicago; that from all over a\r\nvast district the raw material of manufacture should be transported for\r\nhundreds, perhaps thousands of miles, to various howling wildernesses\r\nof highly specialized factories, only to be shipped back again after\r\nfabrication to be used or consumed by many of the original producers,\r\nwas and is one of the preposterous absurdities of an industrial system\r\nsupported on some of the most appalling sophistry that ever issued out\r\nof the Adullamite caves of political economy.\r\n\r\nIn the Walled Towns all this is changed. In the first place no man is a\r\nfree burgess unless he is a land-holder, and the minimum is garden land\r\nsufficient to supply all the needs of his family that can be satisfied\r\nfrom this source; the maximum is that amount of farm land that he\r\ncan maintain at a minimum standard of productivity. So far as I know\r\nevery family also keeps as many cows and poultry as will furnish the\r\nnormal requirements in the shape of dairy products, eggs, and fowl for\r\neating. The farms, which lie outside the walls and quite surround the\r\ntown, do more than this, and much produce finds its way to the communal\r\ndairy, which is used for the production of butter and cheese for the\r\ntownspeople, and also for sale outside the walls. As each town has its\r\nown special products, maintained always at the highest standard, the\r\nmarket never fails.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of cloth and clothing, wool and flax are grown both by\r\nindividuals and by the community, and the spinning and weaving are\r\ndone in the town mills. These are built and equipped at the common\r\ncharge and managed by officials who serve for fixed salaries. A certain\r\npercentage on the value of all raw material brought in for working\r\nup into the finished product is assessed on the owner, and this may\r\nbe paid in cash or in kind. No raw material is ever acquired from\r\noutside the community; all internal surplus is purchased and made up\r\ninto cloth, which is sold first to any townspeople who wish to buy, or\r\nsecond to outside purchasers, the profits going to defray the running\r\nexpenses. As a matter of fact, there is always a large surplus of wool\r\nand flax over and above the normal needs of each producer, and the\r\nmills not only run at a profit but pay well on the original investment.\r\nIn these mills highly perfected machinery is used, for while the Walled\r\nTowns were formed partly for the elimination, so far as possible, of\r\nmachines in the affairs of life, it is realized that they may be used\r\nas actual labour-savers, and without serious injury to the workman,\r\nwhere they are employed on bulk-production such as cloth, and where\r\nthe element of competition is eliminated. Since in manufacture of this\r\nkind division of labour is unavoidable and the work is mechanical\r\nand akin to drudgery, the wages paid are high, while the hours of\r\nemployment never exceed thirty a week. Practically all the employees\r\nare able to take care of their own gardens and many have small farms as\r\nwell. During the seed-time and harvest periods the mills are shut down.\r\nWhen it happens (as it often does) that a mill shows a profit, all in\r\nexcess of three per cent on the value of the plant is divided between\r\nthe employees and the clerical force, for one of the established laws\r\nof all Walled Towns is that capital is entitled only to a fixed return,\r\nthe surplus belonging to the labour, both mental and physical, that\r\nproduces the results. Stock companies as such are strictly prohibited\r\nand it is unlawful to pay money for the use of money furnished by\r\ninactive investors. The mills are of course not large; they are\r\npleasantly situated, not without architectural quality, and they are\r\nalways run either by water-power or by electricity hydraulically\r\ngenerated. Steam is not used in any case.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of real crafts has resulted in reducing the use of\r\nmachinery to the lowest terms. Handicraft has been restored, in wood,\r\nmetals, all fancy weaving, glass making, pottery, leather-work, and\r\nto a certain extent in printing, not only because the results are in\r\nevery way finer and more durable, but because labour so employed is\r\nintelligent, mentally stimulating and physically satisfying, while\r\nby so much the production of coal, the mining, smelting and forging\r\nof iron ore, and the fabricating of articles of iron and steel are\r\nreduced. The Walled Towns hold that such labour is mentally stultifying\r\nif not actually degrading, and it is with them a point of morals that\r\nthey should make it necessary to the smallest degree possible.\r\n\r\nThe main street leads into the central square of the town, a spacious\r\nopen place of great dignity and beauty, surrounded by admirable\r\nbuildings of public character, where the simplicity of the houses\r\nand shops gives place to considerable richness both in design and in\r\ncolour. On one side is the parish church, in this particular case\r\nnot unlike St. Cuthbert’s, Wells, only half hidden by fine trees and\r\nsurrounded by a green and shady churchyard. On another side is the\r\nTown Hall, also with a lofty tower flying the great flag of the city,\r\nwhile the other sides of the square are filled with the rich façades\r\nof the Guild Halls. Opening out of this central square is the Market\r\nPlace, entered through a noble archway between two of the Guild Halls,\r\nand in this square is the Market House and several more Guild Halls.\r\nOpposite, a street connects after some few hundred feet with a third\r\nopen place, in this case a pleasure garden, and here are the theatre,\r\nthe concert hall, the public baths, the principal inn and several cafés\r\nand shops, the latter being more especially devoted to those things\r\nwhich are associated with the lighter side of life.\r\n\r\nBeyond the immediate vicinity of these squares come the\r\ndwelling-places, each a separate house with a garden never less than an\r\nacre in extent. No multiple houses of any sort are permitted and each\r\nfamily must maintain a separate house and garden. The roads here wind\r\npleasantly and are well shaded by trees; niched statues, both secular\r\nand religious, and shrines, are quite common. Here also are the several\r\nconventual establishments belonging to various orders, and varying\r\nmuch as between one town and another, but there is always a house for\r\nmen and one for women. In the particular town we are considering, the\r\nchief monastic institution is Benedictine, and it stands on higher land\r\nthan the rest of the town and is a true abbey both in size and in its\r\nofficial status. There is also a house of Dominican Sisters and one of\r\nCanons Regular of St. Augustine. Where the land begins to drop down\r\nagain towards the river as it curves around on the side of the town\r\nopposite that at which we entered, is the college, with very spacious\r\ngrounds, groves and gardens, the whole commanding a wide view out\r\nacross the zone of farms and so to the low hills on the horizon to the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nLet us now retrace our steps to the group of squares and see something\r\nof the significance of the various buildings and the part they play in\r\nthe life of the Walled Town. We will interrogate some citizen in each\r\ncase who can best explain that portion of the polity with which he is\r\nassociated. The first shall be the parish priest, and he shall talk\r\nto us as we sit in the lych-gate with the silvery grey church behind,\r\nand in front the square where people are constantly passing back and\r\nforth,--not the dull, drab throng of men in ugly “sack-suits” and\r\n“derby” hats of the cities of the outer world, and women in fantastic\r\nfinery or sordid, sad-coloured gowns, but a self-respecting people with\r\nsome sense of beauty and a manifest delight in colour.\r\n\r\n“There is,” says the parson, “as you will see, only one parish church,\r\nthough as the town has grown other chapels have been added in other\r\nquarters, each of which is under a vicar who is one of the general body\r\nof parish clergy. The whole town forms one parish and the whole body\r\nof parochial clergy sit together to deal with the spiritual affairs\r\nof the town, while all the free burgesses meet in common to deal with\r\nthe temporal interests of the parish. No, there are no denominational\r\ndivisions. Each town as it is founded is made up only of those of the\r\nsame religious convictions, and thereafter none is added who is not\r\nof the same belief. Denominationalism is inconsistent with unity of\r\naction, coöperation and true democracy, and however much the laws and\r\ncustoms of the Walled Towns may vary (and there is no little diversity)\r\nin this there is complete unanimity. No one is of course constrained\r\nto go to church or accept the ministrations of the clergy, although\r\nrefusal is practically unheard of. There have been cases of those who\r\nhave lost their faith, but sooner or later this means their withdrawal\r\nfrom the town itself. The parish church is actually the centre of\r\nspiritual life of the community. Its services are very numerous,\r\nparticularly on Sundays and holy days, and it is, as you have seen,\r\na sort of synthesis of all the arts raised to the highest attainable\r\nlevel. Each guild has either its own chapel or altar, and once a year\r\nit holds a great service at which its members are bound to be present.”\r\n\r\n“The relationship between the Church and civic life is, I suppose,\r\nabout what it was before the Reformation. Religion enters into all\r\nthe affairs of life as it did then, and the visible manifestations\r\nare pretty much the same. You will have noticed the many shrines and\r\nstatues in all parts of the town, and you can also see within a few\r\ndays’ time one of the many festival processions through the streets. In\r\nthe Walled Towns religion is not a hidden thing, nor is it segregated\r\nin a few places and confined to one day in the week. In the world\r\noutside the walls, where the old sectarian divisions still continue,\r\nthis realization of religion would be impossible; but within the walls,\r\nbecause of the unanimity of conviction on the part of those that are\r\ndrawn to any particular town, it is not only possible but inevitable.”\r\n\r\nWe cross the square and enter the Town Hall with its shady arcades\r\nand its painted and gilded statues like those on the Hôtel de Ville\r\nof Bourges. We go up a broad stone stairway and enter the anteroom\r\nof the Provost, who is the head of the government. The room has fine\r\ntapestries on the walls, with much well-carved furniture, and the\r\nguards and ushers suggest neither by their costumes nor their manners\r\nthe familiar police officers on duty in the ordinary city hall. The\r\nbuilding and the officials and the grave and rather stately ceremonial\r\nall convey the impression that a Walled Town is both a City State and\r\na Free State, and that its formal and personal expression is a matter\r\nof dignity, reverence and self-respect. Once, not long ago, being in\r\na large city of the North-West, I was invited to address the Mayor\r\nand Aldermen on certain matters pertaining to that department of my\r\nown city government of which I happened to be the head. The corridors\r\nwere crowded with dirty or sinister loafers interspersed with burly\r\npolicemen. There were spitoons everywhere which served only a part of\r\ntheir purpose. The Mayor’s reception room was not unhandsome, but it\r\nwas full of knots of whispering and sly-eyed political hangers-on,\r\nreporters, and more loafers, while the air was rank with tobacco-smoke.\r\nPresently the Mayor and Aldermen strolled in, hailing various\r\nindividuals by nicknames and slang phrases, and disposed themselves\r\nat ease around a long table; some were in their shirt-sleeves, for it\r\nwas a hot midsummer day. I was listened to politely enough, and the\r\nquestions asked were not unintelligent; it was the attitude, the form,\r\nthat was at fault. The whole thing was more like a social meeting of\r\ncommercial travellers in the office of a country hotel than a session\r\nof the governing body of a great city.\r\n\r\nAfter this digression let us return to our Walled Town. From the\r\nanteroom we are conducted to the state reception room, and here we are\r\nreceived by the Provost in his long, furred gown and his gold chain\r\nof office. He is an old man, grey-bearded, and his courtly manners\r\nindicate at once his breeding, his self-respect and his sense of the\r\ndignity and significance of his position. From him we learn that only\r\nland-holders are burgesses of the town and that no others possess a\r\nvote or may hold office; the distinction is less invidious than it\r\nmight appear, for land-holding is so fundamental a principle in the\r\nWalled Towns that there are almost none who cannot qualify. Government\r\nis in the hands of the Provost and Council, with a small group of\r\ndepartment heads who with the Provost form the executive. Any hundred\r\nburgesses may unite for the purpose of choosing one of their number to\r\nthe Council, and as this particular town contains about three thousand\r\nburgesses the Council consists of thirty men who are chosen annually,\r\nwhile the Provost, who is elected by the Council, holds office for\r\nten years. There would appear to be very little legislation; each\r\nyear the Provost presents, with the financial budget, a programme of\r\nlegislation, and until this is disposed of, private legislative bills\r\nmay not be considered. A further guard against the universal curse of\r\ndemocracy, reckless and ill-digested legislation initiated by single\r\nindividuals, is the provision that any private bill must be indorsed by\r\none fifth of all the Councillors before it can be introduced.\r\n\r\nTaxation is almost wholly in the form of rent of land, and here the\r\nscale is fixed from the moment the land is taken over, while it\r\nvaries as between arable land, forest, orchard, pasture, garden and\r\n“tenement,” _i. e._ land on which is a dwelling. If through his own\r\nindustry a land-holder improves any portion of his holding, he receives\r\na rebate on his taxes; if he allows any land to degenerate, his tax\r\nis increased. The tax revenue is supplemented by various fees, small\r\nin amount and not numerous, and by the “gate tax” imposed on those\r\nfrom outside who are admitted to buy or sell within the walls. Public\r\nindebtedness is prohibited by law, the revenue must always meet the\r\nannual expenditure, and no bonds secured by public credit may be issued.\r\n\r\nThe Walled Towns have definitely abandoned the nineteenth century\r\ntheory that the vote is a “natural right.” As said before, this\r\nprivilege is exercised only by land-holders (the great majority of\r\ncitizens) but it may be withdrawn for long or short periods and for\r\nreasons specified in the charter. Any man found guilty of a crime or\r\nmisdemeanour forfeits the franchise, and for periods varying from one\r\nyear to life, dependent on the gravity of the offence. The burgesses\r\nvote only through their “hundreds” and solely for the choosing of\r\nCouncillors, but the election of a Provost must be confirmed by a\r\nmass-meeting of all burgesses, and any change in the charter must be\r\nsubmitted for the same approval.\r\n\r\nThe Law Courts of a Walled Town offer many points of difference to\r\nthose of “the world without.” In the first place, it is a fundamental\r\nprinciple that the object of a Court of Law is the administering of\r\njustice, the defence of right, and the punishment of wrong. An appeal\r\nto technicalities is therefore prohibited, and any advocate who makes\r\nsuch an appeal is promptly disbarred. Normally all cases are tried and\r\ndetermined by a bench of judges, though in certain cases the plaintiff\r\nor defendant may demand a jury trial. Of course all Judges are\r\nappointed by the Provost for life. In addition to the regular municipal\r\ncourts there is a Court of Conciliation. Under the oath of each citizen\r\nto obey and support the charter, every case must be taken to the Court\r\nof Conciliation before recourse is had to the regular courts of law,\r\nthe result being that very few cases fail of adjustment without formal\r\nlegal process. The Law Courts themselves are housed in a building of\r\na degree of beauty unusual even in a Walled Town where ugliness is\r\nunknown, while the form and ceremony reach the final height of grave\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\nLet us now visit one of the guild halls, for it is in the guild that\r\nwe may find the root of the entire economic system which so sharply\r\ndifferentiates society within the walls from that without. We may\r\ntake any one of the half-dozen or more, for all are practically the\r\nsame except in the design of their buildings and the decoration, the\r\nliveries of the members and officials, and the guild banner.\r\n\r\nAll society is organized under the guild system, and every man must\r\nbe a registered member of one guild or another. The guild of the\r\nfarmers is the largest, and usually it is to this that those citizens\r\nbelong who are officials or professional men. Then there are guilds of\r\nmetal-workers of all kinds, cloth-makers, builders, artists, etc. When\r\na Walled Town is founded with small numbers the list of guilds is very\r\nsmall, but as the town increases so do the guilds, and the different\r\nindustries organize their own groups. A guild is an artificial family\r\nmade up of all those of a common interest. Its objects are: human\r\nfellowship, coöperation, mutual aid in illness or misfortune, the\r\nmaintaining of the highest standard in the product of all its members,\r\nprevention of inordinate profits, regulation of the relationship\r\nbetween masters, journeymen and apprentices, the standardizing of wages\r\nand profits, craft training and education, the maintenance of and\r\ncommon participation in religious services, and finally the purchase\r\nof raw materials and the ownership and maintenance of large and costly\r\nmachinery in the few cases where that is employed.\r\n\r\nIn the Walled Town the division between capital and labour does not\r\nand can not exist. Since production is for use, not profit, since\r\ncompetition is impossible under the guild system, and since no\r\nadvertising is permitted beyond a sign-board (and they are sometimes\r\nmost notable works of art, these painted and gilded and carven signs),\r\nexploitation, whether of labour or markets, is unknown. One of the\r\nfundamental points in the town charters is the definite prohibition\r\nof the “unearned increment.” Money may not be taken or paid for the\r\nuse of money, except within each guild, and here only under what are\r\npractically emergency conditions, the rate of interest never exceeding\r\nthree per cent. Every guild has its own fund, made up from dues,\r\nbequests, and a percentage of profits on the sale by the guild of such\r\nsurplus products as may be handed over to its officers for disposal;\r\nbut this fund cannot be invested at interest outside the walls nor is\r\nany portion available for other than guild members, except that the\r\ntown may use it for current expenses in anticipation of the regular\r\nland-taxes (or rent), paying three per cent therefor, and returning it\r\nwithin the space of a year. The system is practically a restoration of\r\nthe guild system of the Middle Ages, and any one may find for himself\r\nfurther details by referring to the many books on the subject; _e. g._\r\nthose of William Morris, Arthur Penty and Prince Kropotkin. It is the\r\nprecise antithesis of collectivism, socialism and trades-unionism of\r\nwhatever form.\r\n\r\nWithin the Walled Towns the educational system shows few points of\r\nresemblance to the standards and methods still pursued outside. It is\r\nuniversally recognized that the prime object of all education is the\r\ndevelopment of inherent character, and for this reason it is never\r\ndivorced from religion; the idea of a rigidly secularized education is\r\nabhorrent, and the dwellers in the Walled Towns rightly attribute to\r\nits prevalence in the nineteenth century much of the retrogression in\r\ncharacter, the loss of sound standards of value, and the disappearance\r\nof leadership which synchronized with the twentieth century break-down\r\nof civilization even if it were not indeed its primary cause. Neither\r\nis there any false estimate of the possibilities of education; it is\r\nheld that while it can measurably develop qualities latent in the\r\nchild by reason of its racial impulse, it cannot put in what is not\r\nthere already. The old superstition that education and environment\r\nwere omnipotent, and that they were the safeguards as well as the\r\njustification of democracy, since given an identical environment\r\nand equal educational opportunities an hundred children of as many\r\nclasses, races and antecedents would turn out equal as potential\r\nmembers of a free society, has long since been abandoned. It is\r\nimpossible to enter into this question at length, but the chief points\r\nare these.\r\n\r\nEducation is not compulsory, but parents are bound to see that their\r\nchildren can “read, write and cipher.” Primary schools are maintained\r\nby the town and are conducted largely along the lines first developed\r\nby Dr. Thomas Edward Shields in the early twentieth century. Beyond\r\nprimary grades the schools are maintained by various units such as the\r\nguilds, the parish and the monasteries and convents. While considerable\r\nvariation exists as between one school and another, they are all under\r\nthe supervision of the Director of Education in order that certain\r\nstandards may be maintained. Variety both in subjects taught and in\r\nmethods followed is held to be most desirable, and complete freedom of\r\nchoice exists between the schools, though a parent wishing to send a\r\nchild to some school other than those maintained by his own guild pays\r\nan annual fee for the privilege. Beyond reading, writing, arithmetic\r\nand music, which are common to all, the curriculum varies widely,\r\nthough history, literature and Latin are practically universal. In some\r\nschools mathematics will be carried further than in others, in some\r\nnatural science, while elsewhere literature, history, modern languages\r\nwill be emphasized. There is no effort to subject all children to the\r\nsame methods and to force them to follow the same courses,--quite the\r\nreverse; neither is the object the carrying of all children through the\r\nsame schools to the same point. It is held that beyond a certain stage\r\nmost children profit little or nothing by continued intensive study.\r\nOn the other hand, there are always those whose desires and capacities\r\nwould carry them to the limit. These are watched for with the most\r\njealous care, and if a boy or girl shows special aptitude along any\r\nparticular line he becomes an honour student, and thereafter he is\r\nin a sense a ward of the community, being sent without charge to the\r\nhigher schools, the college, and even on occasion to some university\r\nbeyond the limits of the Walled Town if he can gain there something not\r\navailable within the walls. Of course any student may continue as far\r\nas he likes, or is able, but this is not encouraged except in the case\r\nof the honour student, and he must himself meet his own expenses. The\r\nauthorities are particularly careful to discover any special ability in\r\nany of the arts, literature and philosophy, and it is the boast of the\r\nWalled Towns that no one who gives promise along any one of these lines\r\nneed fail of achievement through lack of opportunity. In the case of\r\nthe various crafts also the same care is exercised, and a boy showing\r\nparticular aptitude is at once given the opportunity of entrance into\r\nthe proper guild as an apprentice, after he has been prepared for this\r\nby a modified course of instruction adapted to his particular ability.\r\n\r\nThe college has something the effect of a blending of New College,\r\nOxford, and St. John’s, Cambridge. It is perhaps the most beautiful\r\nelement in the Walled Town, and here every intellectual, spiritual and\r\nartistic quality is fostered to the fullest degree. The college is a\r\ncorporation under control of the alumni and the faculty, not in the\r\nhands of trustees, as was the unfortunate fashion amongst American\r\nuniversities in the nineteenth century. There are many fellowships\r\ngranted for notable achievements along many lines, and a Fellow may\r\nclaim free food and lodgings for life, if he choose, the return being\r\ncertain service of a limited nature in the line of instruction, either\r\nas lecturer or preceptor. A few students are received from without\r\nthe walls, but the number may not exceed five per cent of the student\r\nbody, and high fees are charged for the privilege. There are no regular\r\ncourses divided into four years. An honour student must take his\r\nBachelor’s Degree within six years, his Master’s Degree in not less\r\nthan two years thereafter, and his Doctorate in another four years,\r\notherwise his privilege lapses and he must pay as other students,\r\nin which case there are no limits whatever and a man may spend a\r\nlifetime in study if he desires--and can pay the price. All the regular\r\nmembers of the Faculty must be burgesses, but many lecture courses are\r\ngiven by visiting professors from all parts of the world. Latin is a\r\nprerequisite for the Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees, and Greek for a\r\nDoctorate, whatever the line that may be followed.\r\n\r\nAs has been said above, the recreation quarter of the town is around a\r\nsquare or garden a short distance from the central square. Here are\r\nto be found the public baths and gymnasium, together with a number of\r\ngay and attractive cafés and restaurants, the theatres, concert halls,\r\netc. To a very great extent all the music and drama are the product of\r\nthe people themselves. As has been said, music is almost the foundation\r\nof the educational system, therefore trained as they are from earliest\r\nchildhood, good music, vocal, instrumental, orchestral, even operatic,\r\nis a natural and even inevitable result. The same is true of the drama,\r\nand nightly plays, operas, concerts are given by the townspeople\r\nthemselves which reach a standard comparable with that of professionals\r\nelsewhere. Now and then, as a mark of special commendation, actors,\r\nsingers and musicians are invited by the Provost and Council to visit\r\nthe town, but as a general thing all is done by the people themselves.\r\nThe moving picture show is prohibited.\r\n\r\nWith all the rich pageantry of life in a Walled Town, the magnificent\r\nchurch services, where all the arts assemble in the greatest æsthetic\r\nsynthesis man has ever devised, the religious and secular festivals\r\nwith their processions and merrymaking and dancing, the form and\r\nceremony of ecclesiastical and civic life, and the unbroken environment\r\nof beauty, the craving for “shows” which holds without the walls and\r\nmust be satisfied by tawdry and sensational dramatic performances,\r\nprofessional entertainers and the “movies,” is largely absent here\r\nwhere all life is couched in terms of true drama and living beauty.\r\nHere is no hard line of demarcation between a drab and sordid and\r\nhustling daily life on the one hand, and “amusement” on the other.\r\nAll the arts are in constant use, and music and drama are merely\r\nextensions of this common use into slightly different fields. The\r\nsame holds good of the other arts. An “art museum” is unknown, for it\r\nis a contradiction in terms. The Walled Town is full of pictures and\r\nsculpture and all the products of the art-crafts; but the latter are\r\nin every household, while the pictures and sculptures are in all the\r\nchurches and public buildings, where they belong, and are constantly\r\nand universally visible. If an old picture is obtained, or a Mediæval\r\nstatue or a tapestry, it is at once placed in a position similar to\r\nthat for which it was originally intended. It would be perfectly\r\nimpossible for the authorities to put a Bellini altar-piece in a\r\nyawning museum, jostled by crowded others and visible on week-days on\r\npayment of an admission fee, “Saturday afternoon and Sunday free.”\r\nInstead it is placed over an altar in the parish church or in some\r\nchapel. There are museums of sorts, but they are connected with the\r\nguild halls and contain only models for instruction and emulation.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the social organism as it has developed under these\r\ndefinite modes of action? In the first place there are certain explicit\r\ninhibitions, as has already been indicated, the elimination of many\r\ndetails of luxury and artificial desires which tend to turn much human\r\nenergy to futile ends, to raise the cost of living to abnormal heights,\r\nto establish false levels between those that have and those that have\r\nnot, and that defeat every sane effort towards a simplification of life\r\nand its maintenance in accordance with right standards of comparative\r\nvalue. Desires have not been reduced in force, but they have been\r\nvastly cut down in number and turned towards real values. Owing to\r\nthe ban on usury and the unearned increment, and the restoration of\r\nproduction for use in place of production for profit, wide variations\r\nin wealth no longer exist, although there are still differences due\r\nto thrift, more intelligent or prolonged work, and above all to\r\nsuperiority in the thing produced. Variations in social status still\r\nexist; indeed they are fostered, as a matter of fact, but they are\r\nno longer based either on money or on power. A Walled Town is at the\r\nsame time individualist, coöperative and aristocratic, so far more\r\nclosely resembling Mediæval society than any other that has existed,\r\nand therefore sharply differentiated both from society as it had become\r\nin the nineteenth century, and as it was aimed at by the socialists,\r\nthe anarchists and the democrats of the same period. As all society\r\nis organized in guilds, and as in each there are the three classes of\r\napprentices, journeymen and masters, so while each class has its own\r\nrecognized status, there is an equally recognized difference between\r\nthem. An apprentice may not hold land, therefore he cannot be a burgess\r\nof the free city, while a journeyman or master may not become a burgess\r\nunless he does hold land, and only burgesses participate in the civic\r\nduties and privileges of the town. There are certain offices which only\r\na master may hold, and there are others which are open only to those\r\nmasters who have become members of one of the Academies, or who belong\r\nto the Order of Knighthood. The Provost, for example, may be chosen\r\nonly from amongst the knights. These highest ranks of dignity are\r\nconstituted as follows:\r\n\r\nIn each Walled Town there are several Academies, each made up of\r\nthose masters in the several guilds who have achieved the highest\r\neminence. There is one Academy of Science and Craft, an Academy of\r\nArts and Letters, an Academy of Philosophy, etc. Entrance into this\r\ncircle of supreme achievement is effected either by direct choice of\r\nthe members of the Academy, in which case the guild from which the\r\ncandidate is chosen must ratify the choice, or by nomination on the\r\npart of the guild, when the recommendation so made must be sanctioned\r\nby the members of the Academy. Only high proficiency in some specified\r\ndirection is ground for election to these Academies, and membership\r\nis an honour of the greatest distinction. The Order of Knighthood,\r\nhowever, is conferred rather for high qualities of character and for\r\npublic service; any man, apprentice, minor official, servant, may\r\nbe made a Knight if he demonstrates some high quality of honour or\r\nservice. Here the power to nominate lies in the hands both of the\r\nProvost and of the knights themselves, but the latter have the right\r\nto confirm or reject the nominee of the Provost, while he has the same\r\npower if the nomination comes from the knights. Both the Academies and\r\nthe knights have the right to degrade and expel a member of their own\r\norder; but when this is done it must be as the result of an open trial,\r\nif the accused so demands. Conviction of certain crimes and offences\r\nworks degradation automatically.\r\n\r\nThe object of these higher circles of specially chosen individuals\r\nis the official recognition of character and achievement and the\r\nconstituting of certain groups of distinguished men whose duty it is to\r\nguard the highest ideals, not only of their own crafts, but of society\r\nitself through the free city which embodies their communal life. The\r\nWalled Towns know well that, while all men are equal in the sight of\r\nGod and before the Law, there is otherwise no such thing as equality,\r\nthat it would be fatal were it ever achieved, and that the efforts at\r\nits accomplishment have undermined such society as we once had until it\r\nhas crumbled and crashed into the unhandsome _débris_ of its own ruin.\r\nThe determination of inequalities by false standards of comparative\r\nvalue is almost as ill-favoured a thing as a doctrinaire equality;\r\nbetween the cash values of the bourgeois nineteenth century and the\r\ncrazy overturnings and levellings and topsy-turvydom of twentieth\r\ncentury “democracy,” or Bolshevism, there is little to choose. High\r\nvalues, few, cherished, recognized and honoured, are one great end\r\nof society, of life itself, and it is in these crowning marks of\r\ndistinction and achievement that humanity finds its best expression\r\nas well as its safe guides and sure leaders. In the Walled Towns is\r\nalways the ardent quest for something to honour, whether it is some\r\nconcrete product of art, science, letters, craftsmanship, or whether it\r\nis a citizen, an ideal, a memory of the past, a figure in history, a\r\nsaint--or God Himself. Honour, service, loyalty, worship,--these things\r\nhave wholly taken the place of an insolent assurance of equality, a\r\nbawling about rights, a denial of superiority, a proclaiming of the\r\nomnipotence of men “by virtue of their manhood alone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be evident at once that the Walled Towns are founded in\r\ndeliberate opposition to nineteenth century democracy as well as to its\r\nbastard issue, its Mordred and its Nemesis, anarchy and Bolshevism,\r\nand to its inevitable but blood-kin enemy, socialism. Through state\r\nsocialism, communism or internationalism a fool-hardy and illiterate\r\ndemocracy, surrendering at discretion to the materialism of industrial\r\ncivilization, has striven to maintain the thing itself in all its\r\nintegrity and its wealth-producing potency while turning its products\r\ninto the hands of the many rather than the few. Even now, with the\r\nmyrrh of war still bitter on the lips, the dim visions of greater\r\nthings are fading away, and only one cry goes up for ever greater\r\nproduction, for more intensive effort, in order that the material\r\nlosses may be retrieved.\r\n\r\nNeither by state-socialism nor by soviets nor by any other ingenious\r\ndevice can wholesome social conditions be brought out of a thing\r\nunwholesome in itself; neither can a new control, a new basis of\r\nproduction and distribution, or new laws, compacts and covenants,\r\ntake the place of a new spiritual energy, a new vision of ultimate\r\nvalues and their relationships. That communism, collectivism and\r\nsocial democracy have all gone bankrupt during and following the war\r\nis one truth at least we have learned. The methods were foolish enough\r\nbut the object aimed at, the preservation and redemption of modern\r\nindustrialism, was worse.\r\n\r\nThe impulse and incentive towards Walled Towns, whenever it comes, will\r\nbe primarily social, the revolt of man against the imperial scale,\r\nagainst a life of false values impregnably intrenched behind custom,\r\nsuperstition and self-interest, against the quantitative standard,\r\nthe tyranny of bulk, the gross oppression of majorities. It will\r\necho a demand for beauty in life and of life, for the reasonable and\r\nwholesome unit of human scale, for high values in ideal and in action,\r\nfor simplicity and distinction and a realization of true aristocracy.\r\nEngendered of a new spiritual outlook, it may be fostered by the\r\ncompulsion of circumstance, for in spite of the brave front assumed\r\nby those who even now are looking towards a future, it becomes daily\r\nmore apparent that the war has destroyed modern society and that in\r\nspite of all the best intentions in the world it can never be restored.\r\nThe whole fabric of industrial civilization, already rotten at heart,\r\nhas collapsed; it could not save the world from universal war and it\r\npossesses no power to enforce its own recuperation. In five years the\r\npotential in men has been cut down by millions, an enormous amount\r\nof machinery for production and transportation has been destroyed,\r\ntogether with much arable land and many mines. The birth-rate steadily\r\ndecreases all over the world and with no evident prospect of a reversal\r\nof the process. The debts of all the warring nations have reached\r\na point where in some cases the interest charges alone will almost\r\namount to the whole pre-war budget. The entire system of credit and\r\nof international finance has become hopelessly disorganized and no\r\none has yet suggested any way in which it may adequately be restored.\r\nNeither armistice nor peace has brought about even the beginnings of\r\nindustrial recovery; the demand is fabulous and acute, but the problems\r\nof raw materials, transportation, credits, and of markets that will not\r\nonly take but also pay, are apparently unsolvable; meanwhile national\r\ndebts are still increasing through the payment of enormous amounts to\r\nthe unemployed.\r\n\r\nTo meet the crisis there is an unanimous cry for a resumption of\r\nproduction, and for a vastly augmented output through increased\r\nefficiency and more intensive methods, but the crying is in vain, for\r\nmeanwhile the working element has entered on a course of restriction\r\nthat will inevitably nullify every effort at increasing the output.\r\nPartly through its pre-war victories in the contest with capital,\r\npartly through the abnormal wage returns brought into being through\r\nthe desperation of the managers of the war, labour is now successfully\r\nengaged in the work of cutting down production far below what it was\r\neven ten years ago, both by reducing the hours of work and by vastly\r\naugmenting the wage. The actual productivity of a “labour unit” today\r\nis less than at any time since industrialism became the controlling\r\nelement in life, and in many categories it is less and less productive\r\nof satisfactory results. Under these conditions it is hard to see just\r\nhow the reconstructionists expect to obtain that greatly increased\r\noutput they admit is the only visible hope of saving the world from\r\nbankruptcy, chaos and barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe contest is an unfair one, for the entrance of Bolshevism has added\r\na new factor hitherto unknown. Enraged by the failure of strikes and\r\nother war measures to improve their condition, labour is increasingly\r\nturning to the small minority of avowed revolutionists who proclaim\r\nthe rather obvious fact that so long as industry is engineered by the\r\ntwo antagonistic forces of capitalism and proletarianism, no permanent\r\nimprovement in the state of the latter is possible. Every increase in\r\nwages is followed automatically by a greater increase in the cost of\r\nliving, and the ratio today between a wage of eighty cents an hour\r\nand the cost of food, clothing and shelter, is less advantageous than\r\nwas the case when this sum represented not a wage per hour, but per\r\nday. The reason for this state of things is not thought out with any\r\nparticular degree of exactness, and the leap is made in the dark to\r\nrevolution, confiscation and, of late, to Bolshevism. The ease with\r\nwhich an insignificant, alien and unscrupulous minority has succeeded\r\nin destroying society in Russia and Hungary, and the apparent ease with\r\nwhich the same theory has almost been carried out in Germany, and may\r\nbe carried out in France and Italy--not to speak of North Dakota--has\r\naroused all the latent savagery and the impulse to revolt in large\r\nsections of the working classes, but it has also completely terrorized\r\nthe politicians if not the capitalists themselves, and the menace of\r\nanarchy is met cringingly and half-heartedly. It has even acquired a\r\nstrong if somewhat veiled defence among contemporary directors of human\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the results of Bolshevism wherever it is being tried,\r\nthe situation might appear hopeless, for it begins to look very much\r\nas though the attitude of labour, now apparently fixed, would make\r\nimpossible the industrial restoration on which statesmen, captains of\r\nindustry and high financiers count for the saving of the situation. If\r\nthis fails then there appears no escape from international bankruptcy\r\nand a complete breakdown of the modern social system, with all this\r\nimplies of poverty, unemployment and even starvation. This is the\r\nbreeding-ground of Bolshevism, but the hope lies in the fact which is\r\nbecoming more apparent every day, that the thing is even worse for\r\nthe proletarian than for the capitalist or the man of culture and\r\neducation, the criminal being the only one that derives any profit\r\nfrom the adventure. A few months more of Lenine, Trotsky and Bela Kun,\r\nand the danger of Bolshevism will have passed, so far certainly as the\r\nUnited States, Great Britain, France and Italy are concerned.\r\n\r\nYet with the removal of this peril the possibility of a social and\r\nindustrial breakdown still remains, and whether in anticipation\r\nthereof, or as a forced expedient under sudden catastrophe, the Walled\r\nTown offers itself as a means of solution, since it does not depend for\r\nits existence on the maintenance or recovery of the pre-war industrial\r\nsystem--rather on its rejection and reversal--while equally it is the\r\nprophylactic against Bolshevism and its entire reversal.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Walled Towns go back to an earlier age before modernism\r\nbegan; back to the dim cities, the proud cities, the free cities of\r\ncenturies ago. They wall themselves against the world without, and\r\nbuild up within their grey ramparts, and guard with their tall towers,\r\na life that is simpler and more beautiful and more joyful and more just\r\nthan that they had known and rejected because of its folly and its sin.\r\nAs, long ago, when the world became too gross or the terror of its\r\ndownfall too ominous, cell and hermitage, convent and monastery grew up\r\nnow here, now there, in secluded valleys, on inaccessible mountains,\r\nin the barren and forgotten wilderness; as the solitary drew around\r\nhim first a handful, then a horde; as the damp cave or the wattled\r\nhut gave way to multitudinous buildings and spacious cloisters and\r\nthe tall towers of enormous churches, so now, when time has come full\r\ncircle again, is all to be done over once more though after a different\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nMen have despaired of redeeming a crumbling or recalcitrant world and\r\nhave gone out into the desert for the saving of their own souls, and\r\nlo, the world followed and by them was saved. From each centre of\r\nrighteousness and beauty and salvation radiated circle after circle\r\nof ever widening influence; the desert and the waste became orchard\r\nand garden, the ribald and the lawless and the insolent came knocking\r\nat the gates; soldier and bravo and king humbled their heads before\r\ntonsured monk and mitred abbot. Ever wider waxed the increasing circles\r\nuntil they touched, merged,--and the wonder was accomplished; ill had\r\ncome to an end and good had come into being.\r\n\r\nSo the Walled Towns, now when the need is clamorous again. Evil\r\nimperial in scale cannot be blotted out by reform imperial in method.\r\nThe old way was the good way, the way of withdrawal and of temporary\r\nisolation. “To your tents, O Israel!” Gather together the faithful and\r\nthem of like heart, building in the wilderness sanctuaries and Cities\r\nof Refuge. The old ideals are indestructible; they survive through the\r\nscorching of suns and the beating of tempests and as ever they are\r\nomnipotent when they are rightly used. Not for long would the Walled\r\nTowns stand aloof, and rampired against an alien and unkindly world,\r\nfor more and more would men be drawn within their magical circuits,\r\ngreater and ever greater would become their number, and at last the new\r\nwonder would be accomplished and society once more redeemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nObvious typos corrected, where they are supported by the same word in\r\nthe rest of the book.
