For example, when a school-book is illustrated, how much more\r\neasily we understand the subject we are studying through the help we get\r\nfrom pictures of objects or places that we have not seen, and yet wish to\r\nknow about. Pictures of natural scenery bring all countries before our\r\neyes in such a way that by looking at them, while reading books of travel,\r\nwe may know a great deal more about lands we have never seen, and may\r\nnever be able to visit.\r\n\r\nWho does not love pictures? and what a pleasure it is to open a magazine\r\nor book filled with fine illustrations. St. Augustine, who wrote in the\r\nfourth century after Christ, said that \"pictures are the books of the\r\nsimple or unlearned;\" this is just as true now as then, and we should\r\nregard pictures as one of the most agreeable means of education. Thus one\r\nof the uses of pictures is that they give us a clear idea of what we have\r\nnot seen; a second use is that they excite our imaginations, and often\r\nhelp us to forget disagreeable circumstances and unpleasant surroundings.\r\nThe cultivation of the imagination is very important, because in this way\r\nwe can add much to our individual happiness. Through this power, if we are\r\nin a dark, narrow street, in a house which is not to our liking, or in the\r\nmidst of any unpleasant happenings, we are able to fix our thoughts upon a\r\nphotograph or picture that may be there, and by studying it we are able to\r\nimagine ourselves far, far away, in some spot where nature makes\r\neverything pleasant and soothes us into forgetfulness of all that can\r\ndisturb our happiness. Many an invalid--many an unfortunate one is thus\r\nmade content by pictures during hours that would otherwise be wretched.\r\nThis is the result of cultivating the perceptive and imaginative\r\nfaculties, and when once this is done, we have a source of pleasure within\r\nourselves and not dependent on others which can never be taken from us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--HARP-PLAYER. _From an Egyptian painting._]\r\n\r\nIt often happens that we see two persons who do the same work and are\r\nsituated in the same way in the world who are very different in their\r\nmanner; one is light-hearted and happy, the other heavy and sad. If you\r\ncan find out the truth, it will result that the sad one is matter-of-fact,\r\nand has no imagination--he can only think of his work and what concerns\r\nhim personally; but the merry one would surprise you if you could read his\r\nthoughts--if you could know the distances they have passed over, and what\r\na vast difference there is between his thought and his work. So while it\r\nis natural for almost every one to exclaim joyfully at the beauty of\r\npictures, and to enjoy looking at them simply, I wish my readers to think\r\nof their uses also, and understand the benefits that may be derived from\r\nthem. I have only hinted at a few of these uses, but many others will\r\noccur to you.\r\n\r\nWhen pictures are composed of beautiful colors, such as we usually think\r\nof when we speak of the art of painting, the greatest charm of pictures is\r\nreached, and all civilized people have admired and encouraged this art. It\r\nis true that the remains of ancient art now existing are principally those\r\nof architecture or sculpture, yet there are a sufficient number of\r\npictures in color to prove how old the art of painting is.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPT.\r\n\r\nEgyptian painting is principally found on the walls of temples and tombs,\r\nupon columns and cornices, and on small articles found in burial places.\r\nThere is no doubt that it was used as a decoration; but it was also\r\nintended to be useful, and was so employed as to tell the history of the\r\ncountry;--its wars, with their conquests and triumphs, and the lives of\r\nthe kings, and many other stories, are just as distinctly told by pictures\r\nas by the hieroglyphics or Egyptian writings. We can scarcely say that\r\nEgyptian painting is beautiful; but it certainly is very interesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--KING RAMESSES II. AND HIS SONS STORMING A FORTRESS.\r\n_From Abousimbel._]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians had three kinds of painting: one on flat surfaces, a second\r\non bas-reliefs, or designs a little raised and then colored, and a third\r\non designs in _intaglio_, or hollowed out from the flat surface and the\r\ncolors applied to the figures thus cut out. They had no knowledge of what\r\nwe call perspective, that is, the art of representing a variety of objects\r\non one flat surface, and making them appear to be at different distances\r\nfrom us--and you will see from the illustrations given here that their\r\ndrawing and their manner of expressing the meaning of what they painted\r\nwere very crude. As far as the pictorial effect is concerned, there is\r\nvery little difference between the three modes of Egyptian painting; their\r\ngeneral appearance is very nearly the same.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian artist sacrificed everything to the one consideration of\r\ntelling his story clearly; the way in which he did this was sometimes very\r\namusing, such as the making one man twice as tall as another in order to\r\nsignify that he was of high position, such as a king or an officer of high\r\nrank. When figures are represented as following each other, those that are\r\nbehind are frequently taller than those in front, and sometimes those that\r\nare farthest back are ranged in rows, with the feet of one row entirely\r\nabove the heads of the others. This illustration of the storming of a fort\r\nby a king and his sons will show you what I mean. The sons are intended to\r\nbe represented as following the father, and are in a row, one above the\r\nother (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nFor the representation of water, a strip of blue filled in with\r\nperpendicular zigzag black lines was used. From these few facts you can\r\nunderstand how unformed and awkward Egyptian pictures seem if we compare\r\nthem with the existing idea of what is beautiful. There appear to have\r\nbeen certain fixed rules for the use of colors, and certain objects were\r\nalways painted in the colors prescribed for them. The background of a\r\npicture was always of a single, solid color; Egyptian men were painted in\r\na reddish brown, and horses were of the same shade; women were generally\r\nyellow, sometimes a lighter brown than the men; negroes were black, the\r\nAsiatic races yellow, and but one instance is known of a white skin, blue\r\neyes, and yellow hair. The draperies about the figures were painted in\r\npleasing colors, and were sometimes transparent, so that the figures could\r\nbe seen through them.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Egyptian paintings was very mechanical. One set of\r\nworkmen prepared the plaster on the wall for the reception of the colors;\r\nanother set drew all the outlines in red; then, if chiselling was to be\r\ndone, another class performed this labor; and, finally, still others put\r\non the colors. Of course nothing could be more matter-of-fact than such\r\npainting as this, and under such rules an artist of the most lofty genius\r\nand imagination would find it impossible to express his conceptions in his\r\nwork. We know all this because some of these pictures exist in an\r\nunfinished condition, and are left in the various stages of execution;\r\nthen, too, there are other pictures of the painters at their work, and all\r\nthese different processes are shown in them. The outline drawing is the\r\nbest part of Egyptian painting, and this is frequently very cleverly done.\r\n\r\nAs I have intimated, the greatest value of Egyptian painting is that it\r\ngives us a clear record of the habits and customs of a very ancient\r\npeople--of a civilization which has long since passed away, and of which\r\nwe should have a comparatively vague and unsatisfactory notion but for\r\nthis picture-history of it. The religion, the political history, and the\r\ndomestic life of the ancient Egyptians are all placed before us in these\r\npaintings. Through a study of them we know just how they hunted and\r\nfished, gathered their fruits, tilled the soil, and cooked the food,\r\nplayed games, danced, and practised gymnastics, conducted their scenes of\r\nfestivity and mourning--in short, how they lived under all circumstances.\r\nThus you see that Egyptian painting is a very important example of the way\r\nin which pictures can teach us; you will also notice that it is not even\r\nnecessary that they should be pretty in order that we may learn from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnother use made of Egyptian painting was the illustration of the papyrus\r\nrolls upon which historical and other documents were written. These rolls,\r\nfound in the tombs, are now placed in museums and collections of curious\r\nthings; the paintings upon them may be called the oldest book\r\nillustrations in the world. Sometimes a single color is used, such as red\r\nor black; but others are in a variety of colors which have been put on\r\nwith a brush. Indeed, some rolls exist which have pictures only, and are\r\nentirely without hieroglyphics or writing characters; one such is more\r\nthan twenty yards long, and contains nothing but pictures of funeral\r\nceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians were so serious a people that it is a pleasant\r\nsurprise to find that some of these pictures are intended for jokes and\r\nsatires, somewhat like those of the comic papers of to-day; for example,\r\nthere is one in the British Museum, London, representing cats and rats\r\nfighting, which is intended to ridicule the soldiers and heroes of the\r\nEgyptian army.\r\n\r\nOne cannot study Egyptian painting without feeling sorry for the painters;\r\nfor in all the enormous amount of work done by them no one man was\r\nrecognized--no one is now remembered. We know some of the names of great\r\nEgyptian architects which are written in the historical rolls; but no\r\npainter's name has been thus preserved. The fact that no greater progress\r\nwas made is a proof of the discouraging influences that must have been\r\naround these artists, for it is not possible that none of them had\r\nimagination or originality: there must have been some whose souls were\r\nfilled with poetic visions, for some of the Egyptian writings show that\r\npoetry existed in ancient Egypt. But of what use could imagination be to\r\nartists who were governed by the laws of a narrow priesthood, and hedged\r\nabout by a superstitious religion which even laid down rules for art?\r\n\r\nFor these reasons we know something of Egyptian art and nothing of\r\nEgyptian artists, and from all these influences it follows that Egyptian\r\npainting is little more than an illuminated alphabet or a child's\r\npicture-history. In the hieroglyphics, or writing characters of Egypt, it\r\noften occurs that small pictures of certain animals or other objects stand\r\nfor whole words, and it appears that this idea was carried into Egyptian\r\npainting, which by this means became simply a picture chronicle, and never\r\nreached a point where it could be called truly artistic or a high art.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSYRIA.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Assyrian painting are so few that they scarcely serve any\r\nother purpose than to prove that the Assyrians were accustomed to decorate\r\ntheir walls with pictures. Sometimes the walls were prepared with plaster,\r\nand the designs were painted on that; in other cases the painting was done\r\nupon the brick itself. The paintings on plaster were usually on the inner\r\nwalls, and many of these which have been discovered during the excavations\r\nhave disappeared when exposed to the air after their long burial from the\r\nsight and knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of these pictures, the writer on art, J. Oppert, says that some\r\npaintings were found in the Palace of Sargon; they represented gods,\r\nlions, rosettes, and various other designs; but when he reached Nineveh,\r\none year after these discoveries, the pictures had all disappeared--the\r\ncolors which had been buried twenty-five hundred years lasted but a few\r\ndays after they were uncovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--FRAGMENT OF AN ASSYRIAN TILE-PAINTING.]\r\n\r\nAssyrian tile-painting was more durable than the wall-painting; but in\r\nall the excavations that have been made these have been found only in\r\nfragments, and from these fragments no complete picture has been put\r\ntogether. The largest one was found at Nimrud, and our illustration is\r\ntaken from it. It represents a king, as we know by the tiara he wears, and\r\ntwo servants who follow him. The pictures to which the existing fragments\r\nbelong could not have been large: the figures in our picture are but nine\r\ninches high. A few pieces have been found which must have belonged to\r\nlarger pictures, and there is one which shows a part of a face belonging\r\nto a figure at least three feet high; but this is very unusual.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian paintings have a broad outline which is of a lighter color\r\nthan the rest of the picture; it is generally white or yellow. There are\r\nvery few colors used in them. This does not accord with our notions of the\r\ndresses and stuffs of the Assyrians, for we suppose that they were rich\r\nand varied in color--probably they had so few pigments that they could not\r\nrepresent in their paintings all the colors they knew.\r\n\r\nNo one can give a very satisfactory account of Assyrian painting; but,\r\njudging from the little of it which remains, and from the immense number\r\nof Assyrian sculptures which exist, we may conclude that the chief aim of\r\nAssyrian artists was to represent each object they saw with absolute\r\nrealism. The Dutch painters were remarkable for this trait and for the\r\npatient attention which they gave to the details of their work, and for\r\nthis reason Oppert has called the Assyrians the Dutchmen of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBABYLON.\r\n\r\nIn Babylon, in the sixth century B.C., under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nthe art of tile-painting reached a high state of perfection. The\r\nBabylonians had no such splendid alabaster as had the Assyrians, neither\r\nhad they lime-stone; so they could not make fine sculptured slabs, such as\r\nare found at Nineveh and in other Assyrian ruins. But the Babylonians had\r\na fine clay, and they learned how to use it to the best advantage. The\r\ncity of Babylon shone with richly colored tiles, and one traveller writes:\r\n\"By the side of Assyria, her colder and severer sister of the North,\r\nBabylon showed herself a true child of the South,--rich, glowing, careless\r\nof the rules of taste, only desiring to awaken admiration by the dazzling\r\nbrilliance of her appearance.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the Babylonish tiles are in regular, set patterns in rich tints;\r\nsome are simply in solid colors. These last are found in the famous\r\nterrace-temple of Borsippê, near Babylon. We know from ancient writings\r\nthat there were decorative paintings in Babylon which represented hunting\r\nscenes and like subjects, and, according to the prophet Ezekiel, chap.\r\nxxiii., verse 14, there were \"men portrayed upon the wall, the images of\r\nthe Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, girded with girdles upon their\r\nloins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to\r\nlook to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their\r\nnativity.\" Some writers assume that this must have been a description of\r\ntapestries; but most authorities believe them to have been glazed\r\ntile-paintings.\r\n\r\nA whole cargo of fragments of Babylonish tile-paintings was once collected\r\nfor the gallery of the Louvre at Paris, and, when on board a ship and\r\nready to be sent away, by some accident the whole was sunk. From the\r\ndescriptions of them which were written, we find that there were portions\r\nof pictures of human faces and other parts of the body, of animals,\r\nmountains, and forests, of water, walls, and trees.\r\n\r\nJudging from what still remains, the art of painting was far less\r\nimportant and much less advanced among the Eastern or Oriental nations\r\nthan were those of architecture and sculpture. It is very strange that\r\nthese peoples, who seem to have observed nature closely, and to have\r\nmastered the mathematical sciences, made no steps toward the discovery of\r\nthe laws of perspective; neither did they know how to give any expression\r\nof thought or feeling to the human face. In truth, their pictures were\r\na mere repetition of set figures, and were only valuable as pieces of\r\ncolored decorations for walls, adding a pleasing richness and variety by\r\ntheir different tints, but almost worthless as works of art.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT GREECE AND ITALY.\r\n\r\nThe painting of Greece and that of ancient Italy are so much the same that\r\nit is almost impossible to speak of them separately; the art of painting\r\nwas carried from Greece to Italy by the Etruscans, and the art of ancient\r\nRome was simply that of Greece transplanted. If Greek artists were\r\nemployed by Romans, certainly their works were Greek; and if Romans\r\npainted they aimed to imitate the Greeks exactly, so that Italian painting\r\nbefore the time of the Christian era must be considered together with that\r\nof Greece.\r\n\r\nIn architecture and sculpture the ancient Greeks accepted what had been\r\ndone by the Egyptians and Assyrians as a foundation, and went on to\r\nperfect the work of the older nations through the aid of poetic and\r\nartistic imaginations. But in painting the Greeks followed nothing that\r\nhad preceded them. They were the first to make pictures which were a\r\nlife-like reproduction of what they saw about them: they were the first to\r\nseparate painting from sculpture, and to give it such importance as would\r\npermit it to have its own place, quite free from the influence of any\r\nother art, and in its own way as grand and as beautiful as its sister\r\narts.\r\n\r\nThere are writers who trace the origin and progress of Greek painting from\r\nthe very earliest times; but I shall begin with Apollodorus, who is spoken\r\nof as the first Greek painter worthy of fame, because he was the first\r\none who knew how to make his pictures appear to be real, and to follow the\r\nrules of perspective so as to have a background from which his figures\r\nstood out, and to shade his colors and soften his outlines. He was very\r\nfamous, and was called _skiagraphos_, which means shadow painter.\r\n\r\nApollodorus was an Athenian, and lived at about the close of the fifth\r\ncentury B.C. Although he was a remarkable artist then, we must not fancy\r\nthat his pictures would have satisfied our idea of the beautiful--in fact,\r\nPliny, the historian, who saw his pictures six hundred years later, at\r\nPergamos, says that Apollodorus was but the gatekeeper who threw open the\r\ngates of painting to the famous artists who lived after him.\r\n\r\nZeuxis was a pupil of Apollodorus, and a great artist also. He was born at\r\nHeraclea, probably in Lower Italy. When young he led a wandering life; he\r\nstudied at Athens under Apollodorus, and settled in Ephesus. He was in the\r\nhabit of putting his pictures on exhibition, and charging an admittance\r\nfee, just as artists do now: he called himself \"the unsurpassable,\" and\r\nsaid and did many vain and foolish things. Near the end of his life he\r\nconsidered his pictures as beyond any price, and so gave them away. Upon\r\none of his works he wrote, \"Easier to carp at than to copy.\" It is said\r\nthat he actually laughed himself to death from amusement at one of his own\r\npictures, which represented an old woman.\r\n\r\nZeuxis had a rival in the painter Parrhasius, and their names are often\r\nassociated. On one occasion they made trial of their artistic skill.\r\nZeuxis painted a bunch of grapes so naturally that the birds came to peck\r\nat them. Then Parrhasius painted a hanging curtain, and when his picture\r\nwas exposed to the public Zeuxis asked him to draw aside his curtain,\r\nfully believing it to be of cloth and concealing a picture behind it. Thus\r\nit was judged that Parrhasius was the best artist, for he had deceived\r\nZeuxis, while the latter had only deceived the birds.\r\n\r\nFrom these stories it appears that these artists tried to imitate objects\r\nwith great exactness. Parrhasius, too, was a vain man, and went about in\r\na purple robe with a gold wreath about his head and gold clasps on his\r\nsandals; he painted his own portrait, and called it the god Hermes, or\r\nMercury; he wrote praises of himself in which he called himself by many\r\nhigh-sounding names, for all of which he was much ridiculed by others.\r\n\r\nHowever, both these artists were surpassed by Timanthes, according to the\r\nancient writers, who relate that he engaged in a trial of skill with\r\nParrhasius, and came off the victor in it. The fame of his picture of the\r\n\"Sacrifice of Iphigenia\" was very great, and its one excellence seems to\r\nhave been in the varied expression of its faces. The descriptions of this\r\ngreat work lead to the belief that this Pompeian wall-painting, from which\r\nwe give a cut, closely resembles that of Timanthes, which no longer\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nThe story of Iphigenia says that when her father, King Agamemnon, killed\r\na hart which was sacred to Diana, or Artemis, that goddess becalmed his\r\nfleet so that he could not sail to Troy. Then the seer, Calchas, advised\r\nthe king to sacrifice his daughter in order to appease the wrath of Diana.\r\nAgamemnon consented; but it is said that the goddess was so sorry for the\r\nmaiden that she bore her away to Tauris, and made her a priestess, and\r\nleft a hart to be sacrificed instead of Iphigenia. In our cut you see\r\nCalchas on the right; two men are bearing the maiden to her doom, while\r\nher father stands on the left with his head veiled from sight (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--SACRIFICE OF IPHIGENIA. _From a Pompeian\r\nwall-painting._]\r\n\r\nZeuxis, Parrhasius, and Timanthes belonged to the Ionian school of\r\npainting, which flourished during the Peloponnesian war. This school was\r\nexcelled by that of Sikyon, which reached its highest prosperity between\r\nthe end of the Peloponnesian war and the death of Alexander the Great.\r\nThe chief reason why this Dorian school at Sikyon was so fine was that\r\nhere, for the first time, the pupils followed a regular course of study,\r\nand were trained in drawing and mathematics, and taught to observe nature\r\nwith the strictest attention. The most famous master of this school was\r\nPausias; some of his works were carried to Rome, where they were much\r\nadmired. His picture of the garland-weaver, Glykera, gained him a great\r\nname, and by it he earned the earliest reputation as a flower-painter that\r\nis known in the history of art.\r\n\r\nNikomachos, who lived at Thebes about 360 B.C., was famous for\r\nthe rapidity with which he painted pictures that were excellent in their\r\ncompleteness and beauty. Aristides, the son or brother of Nikomachos, was\r\nso good an artist that Attalus, king of Pergamos, offered more than twenty\r\nthousand pounds, or about one hundred thousand dollars, for his picture of\r\nDionysus, or Bacchus. This wonderful picture was carried to Rome, and\r\npreserved in the temple of Ceres; but it no longer exists. Euphranor was\r\nanother great painter, and was distinguished for his power to give great\r\nexpression to the faces and a manly force to the figures which he painted.\r\n\r\nNikias, the Athenian, is said to have been so devoted to his art that he\r\ncould think of nothing else: he would ask his servants if he had bathed or\r\neaten, not being able to remember for himself. He was very rich, and when\r\nKing Ptolemy of Egypt offered him more than sixty thousand dollars for his\r\npicture of Ulysses in the under-world, he refused this great sum, and gave\r\nthe painting to his native city. Nikias seems to have greatly exalted and\r\nrespected his art, for he contended that painters should not fritter away\r\ntime and talent on insignificant subjects, but ought rather to choose some\r\ngrand event, such as a battle or a sea-fight. His figures of women and his\r\npictures of animals, especially those of dogs, were much praised. Some of\r\nhis paintings were encaustic, that is to say, the colors were burned in;\r\nthus they must have been made on plaster or pottery of some sort. Nikias\r\noutlived Alexander the Great, and saw the beginning of the school of\r\npainters to which the great Apelles belonged--that which is called the\r\nHellenic school, in which Greek art reached its highest point.\r\n\r\nApelles was the greatest of all Greek painters. He was born at Kolophon;\r\nbut as he made his first studies at Ephesus he has been called an\r\nEphesian: later he studied in the school of Sikyon, but even when a pupil\r\nthere he was said to be the equal of all his instructors. Philip of\r\nMacedon heard of his fame, and persuaded Apelles to remove to his capital\r\ncity, which was called Pella. While there Apelles became the friend of the\r\nyoung Alexander, and when the latter came to the throne he made Apelles\r\nhis court-painter, and is said to have issued an edict forbidding all\r\nother artists from painting his portrait. Later on Apelles removed to\r\nEphesus.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of his artistic life Apelles did little else than\r\npaint such pictures as exalted the fame of Philip, and afterward that of\r\nAlexander. He painted many portraits of both these great men; for one of\r\nAlexander he received nearly twenty-five thousand dollars; in it the\r\nmonarch was represented as grasping the thunderbolt, as Jupiter might have\r\ndone, and the hand appeared to be stretched out from the picture. This\r\nportrait was in the splendid temple of Diana, or Artemis, at Ephesus.\r\nAlexander was accustomed to say of it, \"There are two Alexanders, one\r\ninvincible, the living son of Philip--the other immutable, the picture of\r\nApelles.\"\r\n\r\nLater in his life Apelles painted many pictures of mythological subjects.\r\nHe visited Alexandria, in Egypt; he did not win the favor of King Ptolemy,\r\nand his enemies in the Egyptian court played cruel practical jokes upon\r\nhim. On one occasion he received an invitation to a feast at which the\r\nking had not desired his presence. The monarch was angry; but Apelles told\r\nhim the truth, and appeased his wrath by sketching on the wall the exact\r\nlikeness of the servant who had carried the invitation to him. However,\r\nPtolemy remained unfavorable to him, and Apelles painted a great picture,\r\ncalled Calumny, in which he represented those who had been his enemies,\r\nand thus held them up to the scorn of the world. Apelles visited Rhodes\r\nand Athens, but is thought to have died in the island of Kos, where he had\r\npainted two very beautiful pictures of the goddess Venus. One of these is\r\ncalled the Venus Anadyomene, or Venus rising from the sea. The emperor\r\nAugustus carried this picture to Rome, and placed so high a value on it\r\nthat he lessened the tribute-money of the people of Kos a hundred talents\r\non account of it. This sum was about equal to one hundred thousand dollars\r\nof our money.\r\n\r\nThe art of Apelles was full of grace and sweetness, and the finish of his\r\npictures was exquisite. The saying, \"leave off in time,\" originated in his\r\ncriticism of Protogenes, of whom he said that he was his superior except\r\nthat he did not know when to leave off, and by too much finishing lessened\r\nthe effect of his work. Apelles was modest and generous: he was the first\r\nto praise Protogenes, and conferred a great benefit upon the latter by\r\nbuying up his pictures, and giving out word that he was going to sell them\r\nas his own. Apelles was never afraid to correct those who were ignorant,\r\nand was equally ready to learn from any one who could teach him anything.\r\nIt is said that on one occasion, when Alexander was in his studio, and\r\ntalked of art, Apelles advised him to be silent lest his color-grinder\r\nshould laugh at him. Again, when he had painted a picture, and exposed it\r\nto public view, a cobbler pointed out a defect in the shoe-latchet;\r\nApelles changed it, but when the man next proceeded to criticise the leg\r\nof the figure, Apelles replied, \"Cobbler, stick to your last.\" These\r\nsayings have descended to our own day, and have become classical. All\r\nthese anecdotes from so remote a time are in a sense doubtful; but they\r\nare very interesting--young people ought to be familiar with them, but it\r\nis also right to say that they are not known to be positively true.\r\n\r\nProtogenes of Rhodes, to whom Apelles was so friendly, came to be thought\r\na great painter. It is said that when Demetrius made war against Rhodes\r\nthe artist did not trouble himself to leave his house, which was in the\r\nvery midst of the enemy's camp. When questioned as to his fearlessness he\r\nreplied, \"Demetrius makes war against the Rhodians, and not against the\r\nArts.\" It is also said that after hearing of this reply Demetrius\r\nrefrained from burning the town, in order to preserve the pictures of\r\nProtogenes.\r\n\r\nThe ancient writers mention many other Greek painters, but none as\r\nimportant as those of whom we have spoken. Greek painting never reached a\r\nhigher point than it had gained at the beginning of the Hellenistic age.\r\nEvery kind of painting except landscape-painting had been practised by\r\nGreek artists; but that received no attention until figure-painting had\r\ndeclined. Vitruvius mentions that the ancients had some very important\r\nwall-paintings consisting of simple landscapes, and that others had\r\nlandscape backgrounds with figures illustrating scenes from the poems of\r\nHomer. But we have no reason to believe that Greek landscape-painting was\r\never more than scenic or decorative work, and thus fell far short of what\r\nis now the standard for such painting.\r\n\r\nThe painting of the early Romans was principally derived from or through\r\nthe early Etruscans, and the Etruscans are believed to have first learned\r\ntheir art from Greek artists, who introduced plastic art into Italy as\r\nearly as B.C. 655, when Demaratus was expelled from Corinth--and later,\r\nEtruscan art was influenced by the Greek colonies of Magna Græcia. So it\r\nis fair to say that Etruscan art and early Roman art were essentially\r\nGreek art. The earliest artists who are known to have painted in Rome had\r\nGreek names, such as Ekphantos, Damophilos, and Gargasos. Later on in\r\nhistory there are painters mentioned with Latin names, but there is little\r\nof interest related concerning them; in truth, Ludius (who is also called\r\nby various authors Tadius and Studius) is the only really interesting\r\nancient Roman painter of whom we know. He lived in the time of Augustus,\r\nand Pliny said of him: \"Ludius, too, who lived in the age of the divine\r\nAugustus, must not be cheated of his fame. He was the first to bring in a\r\nsingularly delightful fashion of wall-painting--villas, colonnades,\r\nexamples of landscape-gardening, woods and sacred groves, reservoirs,\r\nstraits, rivers, coasts, all according to the heart's desire--and amidst\r\nthem passengers of all kinds on foot, in boats, driving in carriages, or\r\nriding on asses to visit their country properties; furthermore fishermen,\r\nbird-catchers, hunters, vintagers; or, again, he exhibits stately villas,\r\nto which the approach is through a swamp, with men staggering under the\r\nweight of the frightened women whom they have bargained to carry on their\r\nshoulders; and many another excellent and entertaining device of the same\r\nkind. The same artist also set the fashion of painting views--and that\r\nwonderfully cheap--of seaside towns in broad daylight.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot think that Ludius was the first painter, though he may have been\r\nthe first Roman painter, who made this sort of pictures, and he probably\r\nis the only one of whose work any part remains. Brunn and other good\r\nauthorities believe that the wall-painting of Prima Porta, in Rome, was\r\nexecuted by Ludius. It represents a garden, and covers the four walls of a\r\nroom. It is of the decorative order of painting, as Pliny well understood,\r\nfor he speaks of the difference between the work of Ludius and that of\r\nthe true artists who painted panel pictures and not wall-paintings. After\r\nthe time of Ludius we can give no trustworthy account of any fine, Roman\r\npainter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--ETRUSCAN WALL-PAINTING.]\r\n\r\nThe works of the ancient painters which still remain in various countries\r\nare wall-paintings, paintings on vases, mosaics, paintings on stone, and\r\ncertain so-called miniatures; and besides these principal works there are\r\nmany small articles, such as mirrors, toilet-cases, and other useful\r\nobjects, which are decorated in colors.\r\n\r\nWe will first speak of the mural, or wall-paintings, as they are the most\r\nimportant and interesting remains of ancient painting. We shall only\r\nconsider such as have been found in Italy, as those of other countries are\r\nfew and unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe Etruscan tombs which have been opened contain many beautiful objects\r\nof various kinds, and were frequently decorated with mural pictures. They\r\noften consist of several rooms, and have the appearance of being prepared\r\nas a home for the living rather than for the dead. I shall give you no\r\nlong or wordy description of them; because if what I tell you leads you to\r\nwish to know more about them, there are many excellent books describing\r\nthem which you can read. So I will simply give you two cuts from these\r\nEtruscan paintings, and tell you about them.\r\n\r\nFig. 5 is in a tomb known as the _Grotta della Querciola_. The upper part\r\nrepresents a feast, and the lower portion a boar-hunt in a wood, which is\r\nindicated by the few trees and the little twigs which are intended to\r\nrepresent the underbrush of the forest. If we compare these pictures with\r\nthe works of the best Italian masters, they seem very crude and almost\r\nchildish in their simplicity; but, if we contrast them with the paintings\r\nof the Egyptians and Assyrians, we see that a great advance has been made\r\nsince the earliest paintings of which we know were done. The pose and\r\naction of the figures and their grace of movement, as well as the folding\r\nof the draperies, are far better than anything earlier than the Greek\r\npainting of which there is any knowledge; for, as we have said, these\r\nEtruscan works are essentially Greek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--HUMAN SACRIFICE OFFERED BY ACHILLES TO THE SHADE\r\nOF PATROKLOS. _From an Etruscan wall-painting._]\r\n\r\nFig. 6 belongs to a later period than the other, and is taken from a tomb\r\nat Vulci which was opened in 1857 by François. This tomb has seven\r\ndifferent chambers, several of which are decorated with wall-paintings of\r\nmythological subjects. A square chamber at the end of the tomb has the\r\nmost important pictures. On one side the human sacrifices which were\r\ncustomary at Etruscan funerals are represented: the pictures are very\r\npainful, and the terror and agony of the poor victims who are being put to\r\ndeath make them really repulsive to see. On an opposite wall is the\r\npainting from which our cut is taken. This represents the sacrifices made\r\nbefore Troy by Achilles, on account of the death of his dear friend\r\nPatroklos. The figure with the hammer is Charon, who stands ready to\r\nreceive the sacrifice which is intended to win his favor. Your mythology\r\nwill tell you the story, which is too long to be given here. The realism\r\nof this picture is shocking in its effect, and yet there is something\r\nabout the manner of the drawing and the arrangement of the whole design\r\nthat fixes our attention even while it makes us shudder.\r\n\r\nThe ancient wall-paintings which have been found in Rome are far more\r\nvaried than are those of Etruria; for, while some of the Roman pictures\r\nare found in tombs, others are taken from baths, palaces, and villas. They\r\ngenerally belong to one period, and that is about the close of the\r\nRepublic and the beginning of the Empire. Modern excavations have revealed\r\nmany of these ancient paintings; but so many of them crumble and fade away\r\nso soon after they are exposed to the air, that few remain in a condition\r\nto afford any satisfaction in seeing them. But fortunately drawings have\r\nbeen made of nearly all these pictures before they fell into decay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--THE ALDOBRANDINI MARRIAGE. _From a wall-painting\r\nin the Vatican._]\r\n\r\nSome of the ancient paintings have been carefully removed from the walls\r\nwhere they were found, and placed in museums and other collections. One of\r\nthe finest of these is in the Vatican, and is called the Aldobrandini\r\nMarriage. It received this name from the fact that Cardinal Aldobrandini\r\nwas its first possessor after its discovery, near the Arch of Gallienus,\r\nin 1606.\r\n\r\nAs you will see from Fig. 7, from it, there are three distinct groups\r\nrepresented. In the centre the bride veiled, with her head modestly bowed\r\ndown, is seated on a couch with a woman beside her who seems to be\r\narranging some part of her toilet, while another stands near holding\r\nointment and a bowl. At the head of the couch the bridegroom is seated on\r\na threshold. The upper part of his figure is bare, and he has a garland\r\nupon his head. On the right of the picture an ante-room is represented in\r\nwhich are three women with musical instruments, singing sacrificial songs.\r\nTo the left, in another apartment, three other women are preparing a bath.\r\nThis is charming on account of the sweet, serious way in which the whole\r\nstory is placed before us; but as a painting it is an inferior work of\r\nart--not in the least above the style which we should call house\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\nAlthough ancient writers had spoken of landscape paintings, it was not\r\nuntil 1848-1850, when a series of them was discovered on the Esquiline in\r\nRome, that any very satisfactory specimens could be shown. These pictures\r\nnumber eight: six are complete, of the seventh but half remains, and the\r\neighth is in a very imperfect state. They may be called historical\r\nlandscapes, because each one has a complete landscape as well as figures\r\nwhich tell a story. They illustrate certain passages from the Odyssey of\r\nHomer. The one from which our cut is taken shows the visit of Ulysses to\r\nthe lower world. When on the wall the pictures were divided by\r\npilasters, and finished at the top by a border or frieze. The pilasters\r\nare bright red, and the chief colors in the picture are a yellowish brown\r\nand a greenish blue. In this scene the way in which the light streams\r\nthrough the entrance to the lower world is very striking, and shows the\r\nmany figures there with the best possible effect. Even those in the far\r\ndistance on the right are distinctly seen. This collection of Esquiline\r\nwall-paintings is now in the Vatican Library.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--LANDSCAPE ILLUSTRATION TO THE ODYSSEY. _From a\r\nwall-painting discovered on the Esquiline at Rome._]\r\n\r\nBesides the ancient mural paintings which have been placed in the museums\r\nof Rome, there are others which still remain where they were painted, in\r\npalaces, villas, and tombs. Perhaps those in the house of Livia are the\r\nmost interesting; they represent mythological stories, and one frieze has\r\ndifferent scenes of street life in an ancient town. Though these\r\ndecorations are done in a mechanical sort of painting, such as is\r\npractised by the ordinary fresco painters of our own time, yet there was\r\nsufficient artistic feeling in their authors to prevent their repeating\r\nany one design.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance proves that this class of picture was not thought very\r\nimportant when it was made, which is that the name of the artist is rarely\r\nfound upon his work: in but one instance either in Rome or Pompeii has\r\nthis occurred, namely, in a chamber which was excavated in the gardens of\r\nthe Farnesina Palace at Rome, and the name is Seleucus.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to speak of all the Italian cities in which these\r\nremains are discovered, and, as Pompeii is the one most frequently visited\r\nand that in which a very large proportion of the ancient pictures have\r\nbeen found, I will give a few illustrations from them, and leave the\r\nsubject of ancient, mural paintings there. Many of the Pompeian pictures\r\nhave been removed to the Museum of Naples, though many still remain where\r\nthey were first painted.\r\n\r\nThe variety of subjects at Pompeii is large: there are landscapes, hunting\r\nscenes, mythological subjects, numerous kinds of single figures, such as\r\ndancing girls, the hours, or seasons, graces, satyrs, and many others;\r\ndevotional pictures, such as representations of the ancient divinities,\r\nlares, penates, and genii; pictures of tavern scenes, of mechanics at\r\ntheir work; rope-dancers and representations of various games,\r\ngladiatorial contests, _genre_ scenes from the lives of children, youths,\r\nand women, festival ceremonies, actors, poets, and stage scenes, and last,\r\nbut not least, many caricatures, of which I here give you an example (Fig.\r\n9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE FLIGHT OF ÆNEAS. _From a wall-painting._]\r\n\r\nThe largest dog is Æneas, who leads the little Ascanius by the hand and\r\ncarries his father, Anchises, on his shoulder. Frequently in the ancient\r\ncaricatures monkeys are made to take the part of historical and imaginary\r\nheroes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--DEMETER ENTHRONED. _From a Pompeian\r\nwall-painting._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--POMPEIAN WALL-PAINTING.]\r\n\r\nFig. 11 shows you how these painted walls were sometimes divided; the\r\nprincipal subjects were surrounded by ornamental borders, and the spaces\r\nbetween filled in with all sorts of little compartments. The small spaces\r\nin this picture are quite regular in form; but frequently they are of\r\nvaried shapes, and give a very decorative effect to the whole work. The\r\ncolors used upon these different panels, as they may be called, were\r\nusually red, yellow, black, and white--more rarely blue and green.\r\nSometimes the entire decoration consisted of these small, variously\r\ncolored spaces, divided by some graceful little border, with a very small\r\nfigure, plant, or other object in the centre of each space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--NEST OF CUPIDS. _From a Pompeian\r\nwall-painting._]\r\n\r\nFig. 10, of Demeter, or Ceres, enthroned is an example of such devotional\r\npaintings as were placed above the altars and shrines for private worship\r\nin the houses of Pompeii, or at the street corners, just as we now see\r\npictures and sacred figures in street shrines in Roman Catholic countries.\r\nIn ancient days, as now, these pictures were often done in a coarse and\r\ncareless manner, as if religious use, and not art, was the object in the\r\nmind of the artist.\r\n\r\nFig. 12, of a Nest of Cupids is a very interesting example of Pompeian\r\npainting, and to my mind it more nearly resembles pictures of later times\r\nthan does any other ancient painting of which I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSAICS.\r\n\r\nThe pictures known as mosaics are made by fitting together bits of marble,\r\nstone, or glass of different colors and so arranging them as to represent\r\nfigures and objects of various kinds, so that at a distance they have much\r\nthe same effect as that of pictures painted with brush and colors. The art\r\nof making mosaics is very ancient, and was probably invented in the East,\r\nwhere it was used for borders and other decorations in regular set\r\npatterns. It was not until after the time of Alexander the Great that the\r\nGreeks used this process for making pictures. At first, too, mosaics were\r\nused for floors or pavements only, and the designs in them were somewhat\r\nlike those of the tile pavements of our own time.\r\n\r\nThis picture of doves will give you a good idea of a mosaic; this subject\r\nis a very interesting one, because it is said to have been first made by\r\nSosos in Pergamos. It was often repeated in later days, and that from\r\nwhich our cut is taken was found in the ruins of Hadrian's villa at\r\nTivoli, near Rome; it is known as the Capitoline Doves, from the fact that\r\nit is now in the Capitoline Museum in Rome. Few works of ancient art are\r\nmore admired and as frequently copied as this mosaic: it is not unusual to\r\nsee ladies wear brooches with this design in fine mosaic work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--DOVES SEATED ON A BOWL. _From a mosaic picture in\r\nthe Capitol, Rome._]\r\n\r\nA few examples of ancient mosaics which were used for wall decorations\r\nhave been found; they may almost be said not to exceed a dozen; but\r\npavement mosaics are very numerous, and are still seen in the places for\r\nwhich they were designed and where they have been during many centuries,\r\nas well as in museums to which they have been removed. They are so hard in\r\noutline and so mechanical in every way that they are not very attractive\r\nif we think of them as pictures, and their chief interest is in the skill\r\nand patience with which mosaic workers combine the numberless particles\r\nof one substance and another which go to make up the whole.\r\n\r\nMosaic pictures, as a rule, are not large; but one found at Palestrina,\r\nwhich is called the Nile mosaic, is six by five metres inside. Its subject\r\nis the inundation of a village on the river Nile. There are an immense\r\nnumber of figures and a variety of scenes in it; there are Egyptians\r\nhunting the Nile horse, a party of revellers in a bower draped with vines,\r\nbands of warriors and other groups of men occupied in different pursuits,\r\nand all represented at the season when the Nile overflows its banks. This\r\nis a very remarkable work, and it has been proved that a portion of the\r\noriginal is in the Berlin Museum, and has been replaced by a copy at\r\nPalestrina.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTINGS ON STONE.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that much of the decoration of Greek edifices was in\r\ncolors. Of course these paintings were put upon the marble and stone of\r\nwhich the structures were made. The Greeks also made small pictures and\r\npainted them on stone, just as canvas and panels of wood are now used.\r\nSuch painted slabs have been found in Herculaneum, in Corneto, and in\r\ndifferent Etruscan tombs; but the most important and satisfactory one was\r\nfound at Pompeii in 1872. Since then the colors have almost vanished; but\r\nFig. 14, from it, will show you how it appeared when found. It represents\r\nthe mythological story of the punishment of Niobe, and is very beautiful\r\nin its design.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASE-PAINTING.\r\n\r\nVase-painting was another art very much practised by the ancients. So much\r\ncan be said of it that it would require more space than we can give for\r\nits history even in outline. So I shall only say that it fills an\r\nimportant place in historic art, because from the thousands of ancient\r\nvases that have been found in one country and another, much has been\r\nlearned concerning the history of these lands and the manners and customs\r\nof their people; occasionally inscriptions are found upon decorated vases\r\nwhich are of great value to scholars who study the history of the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--NIOBE. _From a picture on a slab of granite at\r\nPompeii._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--THE DODWELL VASE. _At Munich._]\r\n\r\nThe Dodwell vase shows you the more simple style of decoration which was\r\nused in the earlier times. Gradually the designs came to be more and more\r\nelaborate, until whole stories were as distinctly told by the pictures on\r\nvases as if they had been written out in books. The next cut, which is\r\nmade from a vase-painting, will show what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Fig. 16 is connected with the service of the dead, and\r\nshows a scene in the under world, such as accorded with ancient religious\r\nnotions. In the upper portion the friends of the deceased are grouped\r\naround a little temple. Scholars trace the manufacture of these vases back\r\nto very ancient days, and down to its decline, about two centuries before\r\nChrist. I do not mean that vase-painting ceased then, for its latest\r\ntraces come down to 65 B.C.; but like all other ancient arts, it was then\r\nin a state of decadence. Though vase-painting was one of the lesser\r\narts, its importance can scarcely be overestimated, and it fully merits\r\nthe devoted study and admiration which it receives from those who are\r\nlearned in its history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--SCENE IN THE LOWER WORLD. _From a vase of the\r\nstyle of Lower Italy._]\r\n\r\nFrom what we know of ancient Greek painting we may believe that this art\r\nfirst reached perfection in Greece. If we could see the best works of\r\nApelles, who reached the highest excellence of any Greek painter, we might\r\nfind some lack of the truest science of the art when judged by more modern\r\nstandards; but the Greeks must still be credited with having been the\r\nfirst to create a true art of painting. After the decline of Greek art\r\nfifteen centuries elapsed before painting was again raised to the rank\r\nwhich the Greeks had given it, and if, according to our ideas, the later\r\nItalian painting is in any sense superior to the Greek, we must at least\r\nadmit that the study of the works of antiquity which still remained in\r\nItaly, excited the great masters of the Renaissance to the splendid\r\nachievements which they attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMEDIÆVAL PAINTING, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA TO THE\r\nRENAISSANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages extend from the latter part of the fifth century to the\r\ntime of the Renaissance, or about the fifteenth century. The painting of\r\nthis period has little to attract attention if regarded only from an\r\nartistic stand-point, for we may truly say that, comparing it with the\r\nGreek art which had preceded it, or with the Italian art which followed\r\nit, that of the Middle Ages had no claim to the beautiful. On the other\r\nhand, it is full of interest to students, because it has its part in the\r\nhistory of art; therefore I shall give a mere outline of it, so that this\r\nlink in the chain which unites ancient and modern painting may not be\r\nentirely wanting in our book.\r\n\r\nEarly mediæval painting, down to about A.D. 950, consists principally of\r\npaintings in burial-places, mosaics (usually in churches), and of\r\nminiatures, or the illustration and illumination of _MSS._, which were the\r\nbooks of that time, and were almost without exception religious writings.\r\nThis period is called the Early Period of the Middle Ages, and the\r\npictures are often called the works of Early Christian Art.\r\n\r\nAbout 1050 a revival of intellectual pursuits began in some parts of\r\nEurope, and from that time it may be said that the Renaissance, or new\r\nbirth of art and letters, was in its A B Cs, or very smallest beginnings.\r\nThe period between 950 and 1250 is often called the Central or Romanesque\r\nPeriod of the Middle Ages, and it was during this time that glass-painting\r\noriginated; it is one of the most interesting features of art in mediæval\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nFrom 1250 to 1400 comes the Final or Gothic Period of the Middle Ages, and\r\nthis has some very interesting features which foretell the coming glory of\r\nthe great Renaissance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe paintings of the catacombs date from the third and fourth centuries\r\nafter Christ. The catacombs, or burial-places of the early Christians,\r\nconsist of long, narrow, subterranean passages, cut with regularity, and\r\ncrossing each other like streets in a city. The graves are in the sides of\r\nthese passages, and there are some larger rooms or chambers into which the\r\nnarrow passages run. There are about sixty of the catacombs in and near\r\nRome; they are generally called by the name of some saint who is buried in\r\nthem. The paintings are in the chambers, of which there are sometimes\r\nseveral quite near each other. The reason for their being in these\r\nunderground places was that Christians were so persecuted under the\r\nRomans, that they were obliged to do secretly all that they did as\r\nChristians, so that no attention should be attracted to them.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristics of these pictures are a simple majesty and\r\nearnestness of effect; perhaps spirituality is the word to use, for by\r\nthese paintings the early Christians desired to express their belief in\r\nthe religion of Christ, and especially in the immortality of the soul,\r\nwhich was a very precious doctrine to them. The catacombs of Rome were\r\nmore numerous and important than those of any other city.\r\n\r\nMany of the paintings in the catacombs had a symbolic meaning, beyond the\r\nplainer intention which appeared at the first sight of them: you will know\r\nwhat I mean when I say that not only was this picture of Moses striking\r\nthe rock intended to represent an historical fact in the life of Moses,\r\nbut the flowing water was also regarded as a type of the blessing of\r\nChristian baptism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--MOSES. _From a painting in the Catacomb of S.\r\nAgnes._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--DECORATION OF A ROOF. _Catacomb of S.\r\nDomitilla._]\r\n\r\nThe walls of the chambers of the catacombs are laid out in such a manner\r\nas to have the effect of decorated apartments, just as was done in the\r\npagan tombs, and sometimes the pictures were a strange union of pagan and\r\nChristian devices.\r\n\r\nThe above cut, from the Catacomb of S. Domitilla, has in the centre the\r\npagan god Orpheus playing his lyre, while in the alternate compartments of\r\nthe border are the following Christian subjects: 1, David with the Sling;\r\n2, Moses Striking the Rock; 3, Daniel in the Lion's Den; 4, The Raising of\r\nLazarus. The other small divisions have pictures of sacrificial animals.\r\nThese two cuts will give you an idea of the catacomb wall-paintings.\r\n\r\nThe mosaics of the Middle Ages were of a purely ornamental character down\r\nto the time of Constantine. Then, when the protection of a Christian\r\nemperor enabled the Christians to express themselves without fear, the\r\ndoctrines of the church and the stories of the life of Christ and the\r\nhistories of the saints, as well as many other instructive religious\r\nsubjects, were made in mosaics, and placed in prominent places in churches\r\nand basilicas. Mosaics are very durable, and many belonging to the early\r\nChristian era still remain.\r\n\r\nThe mosaics at Ravenna form the most connected series, and are the best\r\npreserved of those that still exist. While it is true in a certain sense\r\nthat Rome was always the art centre of Italy, it is also true that at\r\nRavenna the works of art have not suffered from devastation and\r\nrestoration as have those of Rome. After the invasion of the Visigoths in\r\nA.D. 404, Honorius transferred the imperial court to Ravenna, and that\r\ncity then became distinguished for its learning and art. The Ravenna\r\nmosaics are so numerous that I shall only speak of one series, from which\r\nI give an illustration (Fig. 19).\r\n\r\nThis mosaic is in the church of S. Vitalis, which was built between A.D.\r\n526 and 547. In the dome of the church there is a grand representation of\r\nChrist enthroned; below Him are the sacred rivers of Paradise; near Him\r\nare two angels and S. Vitalis, to whom the Saviour is presenting a crown;\r\nBishop Ecclesius, the founder of the church, is also represented near by\r\nwith a model of the church in his hand.\r\n\r\nOn a lower wall there are two pictures in which the Emperor Justinian and\r\nthe Empress Theodosia are represented: our cut is from one of these, and\r\nshows the emperor and empress in magnificent costumes, each followed by a\r\ntrain of attendants. This emperor never visited Ravenna; but he sent such\r\nrich gifts to this church that he and his wife are represented as its\r\ndonors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--JUSTINIAN, THEODORA, AND ATTENDANTS. _From a\r\nmosaic picture at S. Vitalis, Ravenna._]\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Justinian (A.D. 527-565) mosaics began to be less\r\nartistic, and those of the later time degenerated, as did everything else\r\nduring the Middle or Dark Ages, and at last all works of art show less and\r\nless of the Greek or Classic influence.\r\n\r\nWhen we use the word miniature as an art term, it does not mean simply a\r\nsmall picture as it does in ordinary conversation; it means the pictures\r\nexecuted by the hand of an illuminator or _miniator_ of manuscripts, and\r\nhe is so called from the _minium_ or cinnabar which he used in making\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nIn the days of antiquity, as I have told you in speaking of Egypt, it was\r\ncustomary to illustrate manuscripts, and during the Middle Ages this art\r\nwas very extensively practised. Many monks spent their whole lives in\r\nilluminating religious books, and in Constantinople and other eastern\r\ncities this art reached a high degree of perfection. Some manuscripts have\r\nsimple borders and colored initial letters only; sometimes but a single\r\ncolor is used, and is generally red, from which comes our word rubric,\r\nwhich means any writing or printing in red ink, and is derived from the\r\nLatin _rubrum_, or red. This was the origin of illumination or\r\nminiature-painting, which went on from one step to another until, at its\r\nhighest state, most beautiful pictures were painted in manuscripts in\r\nwhich rich colors were used on gold or silver backgrounds, and the effect\r\nof the whole was as rich and ornamental as it is possible to imagine.\r\n\r\nMany of these old manuscripts are seen in museums, libraries, and various\r\ncollections; they are very precious and costly, as well as interesting;\r\ntheir study is fascinating, for almost every one of the numberless designs\r\nthat are used in them has its own symbolic meaning. The most ancient,\r\nartistic miniatures of which we know are those on a manuscript of a part\r\nof the book of Genesis; it is in the Imperial Library at Vienna, and was\r\nmade at the end of the fifth century. In the same collection there is a\r\nvery extraordinary manuscript, from which I give an illustration.\r\n\r\nThis manuscript is a treatise on botany, and was written by Dioskorides\r\nfor his pupil, the Princess Juliana Anicia, a granddaughter of the Emperor\r\nValentine III. As this princess died at Constantinople A.D. 527, this\r\nmanuscript dates from the beginning of the sixth century. This picture\r\nfrom it represents Dioskorides dressed in white robes and seated in a\r\nchair of gold; before him stands a woman in a gold tunic and scarlet\r\nmantle, who represents the genius of discovery; she presents the legendary\r\nmandrake root, or mandragora, to the learned man, while between them is\r\nthe dog that has pulled the root, and falls dead, according to the\r\nfabulous story. This manuscript was painted by a masterly hand, and is\r\ncurious and interesting; the plants, snakes, birds, and insects must have\r\nbeen painted from nature, and the whole is most skilfully done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--THE DISCOVERY OF THE HERB MANDRAGORA. _From a MS.\r\nof Dioskorides, at Vienna._]\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages the arts as practised in Rome were carried into all\r\nthe different countries in which the Romans made conquests or sent their\r\nmonks and missionaries to establish churches, convents, and schools. Thus\r\nthe mediæval arts were practised in Gaul, Spain, Germany, and Great\r\nBritain. No wall-paintings or mosaics remain from the early German or\r\nCeltic peoples; but their illuminated manuscripts are very numerous:\r\nminiature-painting was extensively done in Ireland, and many Irish\r\nmanuscripts remain in the collections of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWhen Charlemagne became the king of the Franks in 768, there was little\r\nknowledge of any art among his northern subjects; in 800 he made himself\r\nemperor of the Romans, also, and when the Franks saw all the splendor of\r\nRome and other parts of Italy, it was not difficult for the great emperor\r\nto introduce the arts into the Frankish portion of his empire. All sorts\r\nof beautiful objects were carried from Italy by the Franks, and great\r\nworkshops were established at Aix-la-Chapelle, the capital, and were\r\nplaced under the care of Eginhard, who was skilled in bronze-casting,\r\nmodelling, and other arts; he was called Bezaleel, after the builder of\r\nthe Tabernacle. We have many accounts of the wall-paintings and mosaics of\r\nthe Franks; but there are no remains of them that can be identified with\r\npositive accuracy.\r\n\r\nMiniature-painting flourished under the rule of Charlemagne and his\r\nfamily, and reached a point of great magnificence in effect, though it was\r\nnever as artistic as the work of the Italian miniators; and, indeed,\r\ngradually everything connected with art was declining in all parts of the\r\nworld; and as we study its history, we can understand why the terms Dark\r\nAges and Middle Ages are used to denote the same epoch, remarkable as it\r\nis for the decay and extinction of so many beautiful things.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL, OR ROMANESQUE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nDuring the Romanesque Period (950-1250) architecture was pursued according\r\nto laws which had grown out of the achievements and experiences of earlier\r\nages, and had reached such a perfection as entitled it to the rank of a\r\nnoble art. But this was not true of painting, which was then but little\r\nmore than the painting of the Egyptians had been, that is, a sort of\r\npicture-writing, which was principally used to illustrate the doctrines of\r\nreligion, and by this means to teach them to peoples who had no books, and\r\ncould not have read them had they existed.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the art of painting was largely under the control of\r\nthe priests. Some artists were priests themselves, and those who were not\r\nwere under the direction of some church dignitary. Popes, bishops, abbots,\r\nand so on, were the principal patrons of art, and they suggested to the\r\nartists the subjects to be painted, and then the pictures were used for\r\nthe decoration of churches and other buildings used by the religious\r\norders. The monks were largely occupied in miniature-painting; artists\r\nfrequented the monasteries, and, indeed, when they were engaged upon\r\nreligious subjects, they were frequently under the same discipline as that\r\nof the monks themselves.\r\n\r\nNext to the influence of the church came that of the court; but in a way\r\nit was much the same, for the clergy had great influence at court, and,\r\nalthough painting was used to serve the luxury of sovereigns and nobles,\r\nit was also true that these high personages often employed artists to\r\ndecorate chapels and to paint altar-pieces for churches at their expense,\r\nfor during the Romanesque period there was some painting on panels. At\r\nfirst these panel-pictures were placed on the front of the altar where\r\ndraperies had formerly been used: later they were raised above the altar,\r\nand also put in various parts of the church. The painting of the\r\nRomanesque period was merely a decline, and there can be little more said\r\nof it than is told by that one word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--KING DAVID. _From a window in Augsburg\r\nCathedral._]\r\n\r\nGlass-painting dates from this time. The very earliest specimens of which\r\nwe know are from the eleventh century. Before that time there had been\r\ntransparent mosaics made by putting together bits of colored glass, and\r\narranging them in simple, set and ornamental patterns. Such mosaics date\r\nfrom the earliest days of Christianity, and were in use as soon as glass\r\nwas used for windows. From ancient writings we know that some windows were\r\nmade with pictures upon them as long ago as A.D. 989; but nothing now\r\nremains from that remote date.\r\n\r\nThere is a doubt as to whether glass-painting originated in France or\r\nGermany. Some French authors ascribe its invention to Germany, while some\r\nGerman writers accord the same honor to France. Remains of glass-painting\r\nof the eleventh century have been found in both these countries; but it is\r\nprobable that five windows in the Cathedral of Augsburg date from 1065,\r\nand are a little older than any others of which we know. This picture of\r\nDavid is from one of them, and is probably as old as any painted window in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--WINDOW. _From the Cathedral of St. Denis._]\r\n\r\nThe oldest glass-painting in France is probably a single fragment in the\r\nCathedral of Le Mans. This cathedral was completed in 1093, but was badly\r\nburned in 1136, so that but a single piece of its windows remains; this\r\nhas been inserted in a new window in the choir, and is thus preserved.\r\nWith the beginning of the twelfth century, glass-painting became more\r\nfrequent in Europe, and near the end of this century it was introduced\r\ninto England, together with the Gothic style of architecture. Very soon a\r\nhighly decorative effect was given to glass-painting, and the designs upon\r\nmany windows were very much like those used in the miniatures of the same\r\ntime. The stained glass in the Cathedral of St. Denis, near Paris, is very\r\nimportant. It dates from about 1140-1151, and was executed under the care\r\nof the famous Abbot Suger. He employed both French and German workmen, and\r\ndecorated the entire length of the walls with painted windows. St. Denis\r\nwas the first French cathedral in the full Gothic style of architecture.\r\nThe present windows in St. Denis can scarcely be said to be the original\r\nones, as the cathedral has suffered much from revolutions; but some of\r\nthem have been restored as nearly as possible, and our illustration (Fig.\r\n22) will give you a good idea of what its windows were.\r\n\r\nThe stripes which run across the ground in this window are red and blue,\r\nand the leaf border is in a light tone of color. There are nine\r\nmedallions; the three upper ones have simply ornamental designs upon them,\r\nand the six lower ones have pictures of sacred subjects. The one given\r\nhere is an Annunciation, in which the Abbot Suger kneels at the feet of\r\nthe Virgin Mary. His figure interferes with the border of the medallion in\r\na very unusual manner.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important ancient glass-painting remaining in France is\r\nthat of the west front of the Cathedral of Chartres. It dates from about\r\n1125, when this front was begun; there are three windows, and their color\r\nis far superior to the glass of a later period, which is in the same\r\ncathedral. The earliest painted glass in England dates from about 1180.\r\nSome of the windows in Canterbury Cathedral correspond to those in the\r\nCathedral of St. Denis.\r\n\r\nIn the Strasbourg Cathedral there are some splendid remains of painted\r\nglass of the Romanesque period, although they were much injured by the\r\nbombardment of 1870. Fig. 23 is from one of the west windows, and\r\nrepresents King Henry I.\r\n\r\nThis is an unusually fine example of the style of the period before the\r\nmore elaborate Gothic manner had arisen; the quiet regularity of the\r\ndrapery and the dignified air of the whole figure is very impressive.\r\n\r\nAn entirely different sort of colored windows was used in the churches and\r\nedifices which belonged to the Cistercian order of monks. The rule of this\r\norder was severe, and while they wished to soften the light within their\r\nchurches, they believed it to be wrong to use anything which denoted pomp\r\nor splendor in the decoration of the house of God. For these reasons they\r\ninvented what is called the _grisaille_ glass: it is painted in regular\r\npatterns in gray tones of color. Sometimes these windows are varied by a\r\nleaf pattern in shades of green and brown, with occasional touches of\r\nbright color; but this is used very sparingly. Some of these _grisaille_\r\nwindows are seen in France; but the finest are in Germany in the Cathedral\r\nof Heiligenkreuz: they date from the first half of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL, OR GOTHIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic order of architecture, which was perfected during this period,\r\nhad a decided influence upon the painting and sculpture of the time; but\r\nthis influence was not felt until Gothic architecture had reached a high\r\npoint in its development. France was now the leading country of the world,\r\nand Paris came to be the most important of all cities: it was the centre\r\nfrom which went forth edicts as to the customs of society, the laws of\r\ndress and conduct, and even of the art of love. From France came the codes\r\nof chivalry, and the crusades, which spread to other lands, originated\r\nthere. Thus, for the time, Paris overshadowed Rome and the older centres\r\nof art, industry, and science, with a world-wide influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--FIGURE OF HENRY I. IN WEST WINDOW OF STRASBOURG\r\nCATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the painting of this period had largely the same characteristics\r\nas that of the Romanesque period, it had a different spirit, and it was no\r\nlonger under the control of the clergy. Before this time, too, painters\r\nhad frequently been skilled in other arts; now it became the custom for\r\nthem to be painters only, and besides this they were divided into certain\r\nclasses of painters, and were then associated with other craftsmen who\r\nwere engaged in the trade which was connected with their art. That is, the\r\nglass-painters painted glass only, and were associated with the\r\nglass-blowers; those who decorated shields, with the shield or scutcheon\r\nmakers, and so on; while the painters, pure and simple, worked at\r\nwall-painting, and a little later at panel-painting also. From this\r\nassociation of artists and tradesmen there grew up brotherhoods which\r\nsupported their members in all difficulties, and stood by each other like\r\nfriends. Each brotherhood had its altar in some church; they had their\r\nfunerals and festivals in common, and from these brotherhoods grew up the\r\nmore powerful societies which were called guilds. These guilds became\r\npowerful organizations; they had definite rights and duties, and even\r\njudicial authority as to such matters as belonged to their special trades.\r\n\r\nAll this led to much greater individuality among artists than had ever\r\nexisted before: it came to be understood that a painter could, and had a\r\nright to, paint a picture as he wished, and was not governed by any\r\npriestly law. Religious subjects were still painted more frequently than\r\nothers, and the decoration of religious edifices was the chief employment\r\nof the artists; but they worked with more independence of thought and\r\nspirit. The painters studied more from nature, and though the change was\r\nvery slow, it is still true that a certain softness of effect, an easy\r\nflow of drapery, and a new grace of pose did appear, and about A.D. 1350 a\r\nnew idea of the uses and aims of painting influenced artists everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--BIRTH OF THE VIRGIN. _From the Grandes Heures of\r\nthe Duc de Berri._]\r\n\r\nAbout that time they attempted to represent distances, and to create\r\ndifferent planes in their works; to reproduce such things as they\r\nrepresented far more exactly than they had done before, and to put them in\r\njust relations to surrounding places and objects; in a word, they seemed\r\nto awake to an appreciation of the true office of painting and to its\r\ninfinite possibilities.\r\n\r\nDuring this Gothic period some of the most exquisite manuscripts were made\r\nin France and Germany, and they are now the choicest treasures of their\r\nkind in various European collections.\r\n\r\nFig. 24, of the birth of the Virgin Mary, is from one of the most splendid\r\nbooks of the time which was painted for the Duke de Berry and called the\r\nGreat Book of the Hours. The wealth of ornament in the border is a\r\ncharacteristic of the French miniatures of the time. The Germans used a\r\nsimpler style, as you will see by Fig. 25, of the Annunciation.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Gothic order of architecture upon glass-painting was\r\nvery pronounced. Under this order the windows became much more important\r\nthan they had been, and it was not unusual to see a series of windows\r\npainted in such pictures as illustrated the whole teaching of the\r\ndoctrines of the church. It was at this time that the custom arose of\r\ndonating memorial windows to religious edifices. Sometimes they were the\r\ngift of a person or a family, and the portraits of the donors were painted\r\nin the lower part of the window, and usually in a kneeling posture; at\r\nother times windows were given by guilds, and it is very odd to see\r\ncraftsmen of various sorts at work in a cathedral window: such pictures\r\nexist at Chartres, Bourges, Amiens, and other places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--THE ANNUNCIATION. _From the Mariale of Archbishop\r\nArnestus of Prague._]\r\n\r\nAbout A.D. 1300 it began to be the custom to represent architectural\r\neffects upon colored windows. Our cut is from a window at Konigsfelden,\r\nand will show exactly what I mean (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\nThis style of decoration was not as effective as the earlier ones had\r\nbeen, and, indeed, from about this time glass-painting became less\r\nsatisfactory than before, from the fact that it had more resemblance to\r\npanel-painting, and so lost a part of the individuality which had belonged\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--PAINTED WINDOW AT KONIGSFELDEN.]\r\n\r\nWall-paintings were rare in the Gothic period, for its architecture left\r\nno good spaces where the pictures could be placed, and so the interior\r\npainting of the churches was almost entirely confined to borders and\r\ndecorative patterns scattered here and there and used with great effect.\r\nIn Germany and England wall-painting was more used for the decoration of\r\ncastles, halls, chambers, and chapels; but as a whole mural painting was\r\nof little importance at this time in comparison with its earlier days.\r\n\r\nAbout A.D. 1350 panel pictures began to be more numerous, and from this\r\ntime there are vague accounts of schools of painting at Prague and\r\nCologne, and a few remnants exist which prove that such works were\r\nexecuted in France and Flanders; but I shall pass over what is often\r\ncalled the Transitional Period, by which we mean the time in which new\r\ninfluences were beginning to act, and hereafter I will tell our story by\r\ngiving accounts of the lives of separate painters; for from about the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century it is possible to trace the history of\r\npainting through the study of individual artists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--PORTRAIT OF CIMABUE.]\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI CIMABUE, the first painter of whom I shall tell you, was born in\r\nFlorence in 1240. He is sometimes called the \"Father of Modern Painting,\"\r\nbecause he was the first who restored that art to any degree of the\r\nbeauty to which it had attained before the Dark Ages. The Cimabui were a\r\nnoble family, and Giovanni was allowed to follow his own taste, and became\r\na painter; he was also skilled in mosaic work, and during the last years\r\nof his life held the office of master of the mosaic workers in the\r\nCathedral of Pisa, where some of his own mosaics still remain.\r\n\r\nOf his wall-paintings I shall say nothing except to tell you that the\r\nfinest are in the Upper Church at Assisi, where one sees the first step in\r\nthe development of the art of Tuscany. But I wish to tell the story of one\r\nof his panel pictures, which is very interesting. It is now in the\r\nRucellai Chapel of the Church of Santa Maria Novella, in Florence, and it\r\nis only just in me to say that if one of my readers walked through that\r\nchurch and did not know about this picture, it is doubtful if he would\r\nstop to look at it--certainly he would not admire it. The story is that\r\nwhen Cimabue was about thirty years old he was busy in painting this\r\npicture of the Madonna Enthroned, and he would not allow any one to see\r\nwhat he was doing.\r\n\r\nIt happened, however, that Charles of Anjou, being on his way to Naples,\r\nstopped in Florence, where the nobles did everything in their power for\r\nhis entertainment. Among other places they took him to the studio of\r\nCimabue, who uncovered his picture for the first time. Many persons then\r\nflocked to see it, and were so loud in their joyful expressions of\r\nadmiration for it that the part of the city in which the studio was has\r\nsince been called the _Borgo Allegri_, or the \"joyous quarter.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the picture was completed the day was celebrated as a festival; a\r\nprocession was formed; bands of music played joyful airs; the magistrates\r\nof Florence honored the occasion with their presence; and the picture was\r\nborne in triumph to the church. Cimabue must have been very happy at this\r\ngreat appreciation of his art, and from that time he was famous in all\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--THE MADONNA OF THE CHURCH OF SANTA MARIA\r\nNOVELLA.]\r\n\r\nAnother madonna by this master is in the Academy of Florence, and one\r\nattributed to him is in the Louvre, in Paris.\r\n\r\nCimabue died about 1302, and was buried in the Church of Santa Maria del\r\nFiore, or the Cathedral of Florence. Above his tomb these words were\r\ninscribed: \"Cimabue thought himself master of the field of painting. While\r\nliving, he was so. Now he holds his place among the stars of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nOther artists who were important in this early time of the revival of\r\npainting were ANDREA TAFI, a mosaist of Florence, MARGARITONE OF AREZZO,\r\nGUIDO OF SIENA, and of the same city DUCCIO, the son of Buoninsegna. This\r\nlast painter flourished from 1282 to 1320; his altar-piece for the\r\nCathedral of Siena was also carried to its place in solemn procession,\r\nwith the sound of trumpet, drum, and bell.\r\n\r\nGIOTTO DI BONDONE was the next artist in whom we have an unusual interest.\r\nHe was born at Del Colle, in the commune of Vespignano, probably about\r\n1266, though the date is usually given ten years later. One of the best\r\nreasons for calling Cimabue the \"Father of Painting\" is that he acted the\r\npart of a father to Giotto, who proved to be so great an artist that from\r\nhis time painting made a rapid advance. The story is that one day when\r\nCimabue rode in the valley of Vespignano he saw a shepherd-boy who was\r\ndrawing a portrait of one of his sheep on a flat rock, by means of a\r\npointed bit of slate for a pencil. The sketch was so good that Cimabue\r\noffered to take the boy to Florence, and teach him to paint. The boy's\r\nfather consented, and henceforth the little Giotto lived with Cimabue, who\r\ninstructed him in painting, and put him to study letters under Brunetto\r\nLatini, who was also the teacher of the great poet, Dante.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--PORTRAIT OF DANTE, PAINTED BY GIOTTO.]\r\n\r\nThe picture which we give here is from the earliest work by Giotto of\r\nwhich we have any knowledge. In it were the portraits of Dante, Latini,\r\nand several others. This picture was painted on a wall of the Podestà at\r\nFlorence, and when Dante was exiled from that city his portrait was\r\ncovered with whitewash; in 1841 it was restored to the light, having been\r\nhidden for centuries. It is a precious memento of the friendship between\r\nthe great artist and the divine poet, who expressed his admiration of\r\nGiotto in these lines:--\r\n\r\n      \"In painting Cimabue fain had thought\r\n         To lord the field; now Giotto has the cry,\r\n       So that the other's fame in shade is brought.\"\r\n\r\nGiotto did much work in Florence; he also, about 1300, executed frescoes\r\nin the Lower Church at Assisi; from 1303-1306 he painted his beautiful\r\npictures in the Cappella dell' Arena, at Padua, by which the genius of\r\nGiotto is now most fully shown. He worked at Rimini also, and about 1330\r\nwas employed by King Robert of Naples, who conferred many honors upon him,\r\nand made him a member of his own household. In 1334 Giotto was made the\r\nchief master of the cathedral works in Florence, as well as of the city\r\nfortifications and all architectural undertakings by the city authorities.\r\nHe held this high position but three years, as he died on January 8, 1337.\r\n\r\nGiotto was also a great architect, as is well known from his tower in\r\nFlorence, for which he made all the designs and a part of the working\r\nmodels, while some of the sculptures and reliefs upon it prove that he was\r\nskilled in modelling and carving. He worked in mosaics also, and the\r\nfamous \"Navicella,\" in the vestibule of St. Peter's at Rome, was\r\noriginally made by him, but has now been so much restored that it is\r\ndoubtful if any part of what remains was done by Giotto's hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--GIOTTO'S CAMPANILE AND THE DUOMO. _Florence._]\r\n\r\nThe works of Giotto are too numerous to be mentioned here, and his\r\nmerits as an artist too important to be discussed in our limits; but his\r\nadvance in painting was so great that he deserved the great compliment of\r\nCennino, who said that Giotto \"had done or translated the art of painting\r\nfrom Greek into Latin.\"\r\n\r\nI shall, however, tell you of one excellent thing that he did, which was\r\nto make the representation of the crucifix far more refined and\r\nChrist-like than it had ever been. Before his time every effort had been\r\nmade to picture physical agony alone. Giotto gave a gentle face, full of\r\nsuffering, it is true, but also expressive of tenderness and resignation,\r\nand it would not be easy to paint a better crucifix than those of this\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nIn person Giotto was so ugly that his admirers made jokes about it; but he\r\nwas witty and attractive in conversation, and so modest that his friends\r\nwere always glad to praise him while he lived, and since his death his\r\nfame has been cherished by all who have written of him. There are many\r\nanecdotes told of Giotto. One is that on a very hot day in Naples, King\r\nRobert said to the painter, \"Giotto, if I were you, I would leave work,\r\nand rest.\" Giotto quickly replied, \"So would I, sire, _if I were you_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the same king asked him to paint a picture which would represent his\r\nkingdom, Giotto drew an ass bearing a saddle on which were a crown and\r\nsceptre, while at the feet of the ass there was a new saddle with a\r\nshining new crown and sceptre, at which the ass was eagerly smelling. By\r\nthis he intended to show that the Neapolitans were so fickle that they\r\nwere always looking for a new king.\r\n\r\nThere is a story which has been often repeated which says, that in order\r\nto paint his crucifixes so well, he persuaded a man to be bound to a cross\r\nfor an hour as a model; and when he had him there he stabbed him, in order\r\nto see such agony as he wished to paint. When the Pope saw the picture he\r\nwas so pleased with it that he wished to have it for his own chapel; then\r\nGiotto confessed what he had done, and showed the body of the dead man.\r\nThe Pope was so angry that he threatened the painter with the same death,\r\nupon which Giotto brushed the picture over so that it seemed to be\r\ndestroyed. Then the Pope so regretted the loss of the crucifix that he\r\npromised to pardon Giotto if he would paint him another as good. Giotto\r\nexacted the promise in writing, and then, with a wet sponge, removed the\r\nwash he had used, and the picture was as good as before. According to\r\ntradition all famous crucifixes were drawn from this picture ever after.\r\n\r\nWhen Boniface VIII. sent a messenger to invite Giotto to Rome, the\r\nmessenger asked Giotto to show him something of the art which had made him\r\nso famous. Giotto, with a pencil, by a single motion drew so perfect a\r\ncircle that it was thought to be a miracle, and this gave rise to a\r\nproverb still much used in Italy:--_Piu tondo che l'O di Giotto_, or,\r\n\"Rounder than the O of Giotto.\"\r\n\r\nGiotto had a wife and eight children, of whom nothing is known but that\r\nhis son Francesco became a painter. Giotto died in 1337, and was buried\r\nwith great honors in the Church of Santa Maria del Fiore. Lorenzo de\r\nMedici erected a monument to his memory. The pupils and followers of\r\nGiotto were very numerous, and were called Giotteschi; among these TADDEO\r\nGADDI, and his son AGNOLO, are most famous: others were MASO and BERNARDO\r\nDI DADDO; but I shall not speak in detail of these artists.\r\n\r\nWhile Giotto was making the art of Florence famous, there was an artist in\r\nSiena who raised the school of that city to a place of great honor. This\r\nwas SIMONE MARTINI, who lived from 1283 to 1344, and is often called\r\nSIMONE MEMMI because he married a sister of another painter, LIPPO MEMMI.\r\nThe most important works of Simone which remain are at Siena in the\r\nPalazzo Pubblico and in the Lower Church at Assisi. There is one\r\nbeautiful work of his in the Royal Institution, at Liverpool, which\r\nillustrates the text, \"Behold, thy father and I have sought Thee,\r\nsorrowing.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Papal court was at Avignon, in 1338, Simone removed to that\r\ncity. Here he became the friend of Petrarch and of Laura, and has been\r\npraised by this poet as Giotto was by Dante.\r\n\r\nAnother eminent Florentine artist was ANDREA ORCAGNA, as he is called,\r\nthough his real name was ANDREA ARCAGNUOLO DI CIONE. He was born about\r\n1329, and died about 1368. It has long been the custom to attribute to\r\nOrcagna some of the most important frescoes in the Campo Santo at Pisa;\r\nbut it is so doubtful whether he worked there that I shall not speak of\r\nthem. His father was a goldsmith, and Orcagna first studied his father's\r\ncraft; he was also an architect, sculptor, mosaist, and poet, as well as a\r\npainter. He made an advance in color and in the painting of atmosphere\r\nthat gives him high rank as a painter; as a sculptor, his tabernacle in\r\nthe Church of Or San Michele speaks his praise. Mr. C. C. Perkins thus\r\ndescribes it: \"Built of white marble in the Gothic style, enriched with\r\nevery kind of ornament, and storied with bas-reliefs illustrative of the\r\nMadonna's history from her birth to her death, it rises in stately beauty\r\ntoward the roof of the church, and, whether considered from an\r\narchitectural, sculptural, or symbolic point of view, must excite the\r\nwarmest admiration in all who can appreciate the perfect unity of\r\nconception through which its bas-reliefs, statuettes, busts, intaglios,\r\nmosaics, and incrustations of _pietre dure_, gilded glass, and enamels are\r\nwelded into a unique whole.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it is as an architect that Orcagna is most interesting to us,\r\nfor he it was who made the designs for the Loggia de Lanzi in Florence.\r\nThis was built as a place for public assembly, and the discussion of the\r\ntopics of the day in rainy weather; it received its name on account of\r\nits nearness to the German guard-house which was called that of the\r\nLandsknechts (in German), or Lanzi, as it was given in Italian. Orcagna\r\nprobably died before the Loggia was completed, and his brother Bernardo\r\nsucceeded him as architect of the commune. This Loggia is one of the most\r\ninteresting places in Florence, fully in sight of the Palazzo Signoria,\r\nnear the gallery of the Uffizi, and itself the storehouse of precious\r\nworks of sculpture.\r\n\r\nThere were also in these early days of the fourteenth century schools of\r\nart at Bologna and Modena; but we know so little of them in detail that I\r\nshall not attempt to give any account of them here, but will pass to the\r\nearly artists who may be said to belong to the true Renaissance in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN ITALY, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE RENAISSANCE\r\nTO THE PRESENT CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reawakening of Art in Italy which followed the darkness of the Middle\r\nAges, dates from about the beginning of the fifteenth century and is\r\ncalled the Renaissance. The Italians have a method of reckoning the\r\ncenturies which differs from ours. Thus we call 1800 the first year of the\r\nnineteenth century, but they call it the first of the eighteenth; so the\r\npainters of what was to us the fifteenth century are called by Italians\r\nthe \"_quattrocentisti_,\" or men of the fourteenth century, and while to us\r\nthe term \"_cinquecento_\" means the style of the sixteenth century, to the\r\nItalians the same century, which begins with 1500, is the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nI shall use our own method of reckoning in my writing; but this fact\r\nshould be known to all who read or study art.\r\n\r\nThe first painter of whom I shall now speak is known to us as FRA\r\nANGELICO. His name was Guido, the son of Pietro, and he was born at\r\nVicchio in the province of Mugello, in the year 1387. We know that his\r\nfamily was in such circumstances that the young Guido could have led a\r\nlife of ease; but he early determined to become a preaching friar.\r\nMeantime, even as a boy, he showed his taste for art, and there are six\r\nyears in his life, from the age of fourteen to twenty, of which no one can\r\ntell the story. However, from what followed it is plain that during this\r\ntime he must somewhere have devoted himself to the study of painting and\r\nto preparation for his life as a monk.\r\n\r\nBefore he was fully twenty years old, he entered the convent at Fiesole,\r\nand took the name of Fra, or Brother Giovanni; soon after, his elder\r\nbrother joined him there, and became Fra Benedetto. Later on our artist\r\nwas called Fra Angelico, and again _Il Beato Angelico_, and then,\r\naccording to Italian custom, the name of the town from which he came was\r\nadded, so that he was at last called _Il Beato Giovanni, detto Angelico,\r\nda Fiesole_, which means, \"The Blessed John, called the Angelic, of\r\nFiesole.\" The title _Il Beato_ is usually conferred by the church, but it\r\nwas given to Fra Angelico by the people, because of his saintly character\r\nand works.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1407 that Fra Angelico was admitted to the convent in Fiesole,\r\nand after seven years of peaceful life there he was obliged to flee with\r\nhis companions to Foligno. It was at the time when three different popes\r\nclaimed the authority over the Church of Rome, and the city of Florence\r\ndeclared itself in favor of Alexander V.; but the monks of Fiesole adhered\r\nto Gregory XII., and for this reason were driven from their convent. Six\r\nyears they dwelt at Foligno; then the plague broke out in the country\r\nabout them, and again they fled to Cortona. Pictures painted by Fra\r\nAngelico at this time still remain in the churches of Cortona.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of ten years the monks returned to Fiesole, where our\r\nartist passed the next eighteen years. This was the richest period of his\r\nlife: his energy was untiring, and his zeal both as an artist and as a\r\npriest burned with a steady fire. His works were sought for far and wide,\r\nand most of his easel-pictures were painted during this time. Fra Angelico\r\nwould never accept the money which was paid for his work; it was given\r\ninto the treasury of his convent; neither did he accept any commission\r\nwithout the consent of the prior. Naturally, the monk-artist executed\r\nworks for the adornment of his own convent. Some of these have been sold\r\nand carried to other cities and countries, and those which remain have\r\nbeen too much injured and too much restored to be considered important\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--FRA ANGELICO. _From the representation of him in\r\nthe fresco of the \"Last Judgment,\" by Fra Bartolommeo, in Santa Maria\r\nNuova, Florence._]\r\n\r\nHe painted so many pictures during this second residence at Fiesole, not\r\nonly for public places, but for private citizens, that Vasari wrote: \"This\r\nFather painted so many pictures, which are dispersed through the houses of\r\nthe Florentines, that sometimes I am lost in wonder when I think how works\r\nso good and so many could, though in the course of many years, have been\r\nbrought to perfection by one man alone.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1436 the great Cosimo de Medici insisted that the monks of Fiesole\r\nshould again leave their convent, and remove to that of San Marco, in\r\nFlorence. Most unwillingly the brethren submitted, and immediately Cosimo\r\nset architects and builders to work to erect a new convent, for the old\r\none was in a ruinous state. The new cloisters offered a noble field to the\r\ngenius of Fra Angelico, and he labored for their decoration with his whole\r\nsoul; though the rule of the order was so strict that the pictures in the\r\ncells could be seen only by the monks, he put all his skill into them, and\r\nlabored as devotedly as if the whole world could see and praise them, as\r\nindeed has since been done. His pictures in this convent are so numerous\r\nthat we must not describe them, but will say that the Crucifixion in the\r\nchapter-room is usually called his masterpiece. It is nearly twenty-five\r\nfeet square, and, besides the usual figures in this subject, the Saviour\r\nand the thieves, with the executioners, there are holy women, the founders\r\nof various orders, the patrons of the convent, and companies of saints. In\r\nthe frame there are medallions with several saints and a Sibyl, each\r\nbearing an inscription from the prophecies relating to Christ's death;\r\nwhile below all, St. Dominic, the founder of the artist's order, bears a\r\ngenealogical tree with many portraits of those who had been eminent among\r\nhis followers. For this reason this picture has great historic value.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1445, Pope Eugenius IV., who had dedicated the new convent of\r\nSan Marco and seen the works of Angelico, summoned him to Rome. It is said\r\nthat the Pope not only wished for some of his paintings, but he also\r\ndesired to honor Angelico by giving him the archbishopric of Florence; but\r\nwhen this high position was offered him, Fra Angelico would not accept of\r\nit: he declared himself unequal to its duties, and begged the Pope to\r\nappoint Fra Antonino in his stead. This request was granted, and Angelico\r\nwent on with his work as before, in all humility fulfilling his\r\nheaven-born mission to lead men to better lives through the sweet\r\ninfluence of his divine art.\r\n\r\nThe honor which had been tendered him was great--one which the noblest men\r\nwere striving for--but if he realized this he did not regret his decision,\r\nneither was he made bold or vain by the royal tribute which the Pope had\r\npaid him.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the most important works of Fra Angelico were done in the\r\nchapel of Pope Nicholas V., in the Vatican, and in the chapel which he\r\ndecorated in the Cathedral of Orvieto. He worked there one summer, and the\r\nwork was continued by Luca Signorelli. The remainder of his life was\r\npassed so quietly that little can be told of it. It is not even known with\r\ncertainty whether he ever returned to Florence, and by some strange fate\r\nthe key to the chapel which he painted in the Vatican was lost during two\r\ncenturies, and the pictures could only be seen by entering through a\r\nwindow. Thus it would seem that his last years were passed in the quiet\r\nwork which he best loved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--AN ANGEL. _In the Uffizi, Florence. By Fra\r\nAngelico._]\r\n\r\nWhen his final illness was upon him, the brethren of Santa Maria Sopra\r\nMinerva, where he resided, gathered about him, and chanted the _Salve\r\nRegina_. He died on the 18th of February, 1455, when sixty-seven years\r\nold. His tombstone is in the church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, in Rome;\r\non it lies the figure of a Dominican monk in marble. Pope Nicholas V.\r\nwrote his epitaph in Latin. The following translation is by Professor\r\nNorton:\r\n\r\n      \"Not mine be the praise that I was a second Apelles,\r\n       But that I gave all my gains to thine, O Christ!\r\n       One work is for the earth, another for heaven.\r\n       The city, the Flower of Tuscany, bore me--John.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Convent of San Marco in Florence there are twenty-five pictures by\r\nthis master; in the Academy of Florence there are about sixty; there are\r\neleven in the chapel of Nicholas V., and still others in the Vatican\r\ngallery. The Church of Santa Maria Novella, Florence, the Cathedral of\r\nOrvieto, the Church of St. Domenico in Perugia, and that of Cortona, are\r\nall rich in his works. Besides these a few exist in some of the principal\r\nEuropean galleries; but I love best to see them in San Marco, where he\r\npainted them for his brethren, and where they seem most at home.\r\n\r\nThe chief merit of the pictures of Fra Angelico is the sweet and tender\r\nexpression of the faces of his angels and saints, or any beings who are\r\nholy and good; he never succeeded in painting evil and sin in such a way\r\nas to terrify one; his gentle nature did not permit him to represent that\r\nwhich it could not comprehend, and the very spirit of purity seems to\r\nbreathe through every picture.\r\n\r\nTwo other Florentine artists of the same era with Fra Angelico were\r\nMASOLINO, whose real name was PANICALE, and TOMMASO GUIDI, called MASACCIO\r\non account of his want of neatness. The style of these two masters was\r\nmuch the same, but Masaccio became so much the greater that little is\r\nsaid of Masolino. The principal works of Masaccio are a series of frescoes\r\nin the Brancacci Chapel in Florence. They represent \"The Expulsion from\r\nParadise,\" \"The Tribute Money,\" \"Peter Baptizing,\" \"Peter Curing the Blind\r\nand Lame,\" \"The Death of Ananias,\" \"Simon Magus,\" and the \"Resuscitation\r\nof the King's Son.\" There is a fresco by Masolino in the same chapel; it\r\nis \"The Preaching of Peter.\" Masaccio was in fact a remarkable painter.\r\nSome one has said that he seemed to hold Giotto by one hand, and reach\r\nforward to Raphael with the other; and considering the pictures which were\r\npainted before his time, his works are as wonderful as Raphael's are\r\nbeautiful. He died in 1429.\r\n\r\nPAOLO UCCELLO (1396-1479) and FILIPPO LIPPI (1412-1469) were also good\r\npainters, and SANDRO BOTTICELLI (1447-1515), a pupil of Filippo, was\r\ncalled the best Florentine painter of his time. FILLIPINO LIPPI\r\n(1460-1505) was a pupil of Botticelli and a very important artist. ANDREA\r\nVERROCCHIO, LORENZO DI CREDI, and ANTONIO POLLAJUOLO were all good\r\npainters of the Florentine school of the last half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nOf the same period was DOMENICO GHIRLANDAJO (1449-1494), who ranks very\r\nhigh on account of his skill in the composition of his works and as a\r\ncolorist. He made his pictures very interesting also to those of his own\r\ntime, and to those of later days, by introducing portraits of certain\r\ncitizens of Florence into pictures which he painted in the Church of Santa\r\nMaria Novella and other public places in the city. He did not usually make\r\nthem actors in the scene he represented, but placed them in detached\r\ngroups as if they were looking at the picture themselves. While his scenes\r\nwere laid in the streets known to us, and his architecture was familiar,\r\nhe did not run into the fantastic or lose the picturesque effect which is\r\nalways pleasing. Without being one of the greatest of the Italian masters\r\nGhirlandajo was a very important painter. He was also a teacher of the\r\ngreat Michael Angelo.\r\n\r\nOther prominent Florentine painters of the close of the fifteenth century\r\nwere FRANCISCO GRANACCI (1477-1543), LUCA SIGNORELLI (1441-1521), BENOZZO\r\nGOZZOLI (1424-1485), and COSIMO ROSSELLI (1439-1506).\r\n\r\nSome good painters worked in Venice from the last half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury; but I shall begin to speak of the Venetian school with some\r\naccount of the Bellini. The father of this family was JACOPO BELLINI\r\n(1395-1470), and his sons were GENTILE BELLINI (1421-1507) and GIOVANNI\r\nBELLINI (1426-1516).\r\n\r\nThe sketch-book of the father is one of the treasures of the British\r\nMuseum. It has 99 pages, 17 by 13 inches in size, and contains sketches of\r\nalmost everything--still and animal life, nature, ancient sculpture,\r\nbuildings and human figures, stories of the Scriptures, of mythology, and\r\nof the lives of the saints are all illustrated in its sketches, as well as\r\nhawking parties, village scenes, apes, eagles, dogs, and cats. In this\r\nbook the excellence of his drawing is seen; but so few of his works remain\r\nthat we cannot judge of him as a colorist. It is certain that he laid the\r\nfoundation of the excellence of the Venetian school, which his son\r\nGiovanni and the great Titian carried to perfection.\r\n\r\nThe elder son, Gentile, was a good artist, and gained such a reputation by\r\nhis pictures in the great council-chamber of Venice, that when, in 1479,\r\nSultan Mehemet, the conqueror of Constantinople, sent to Venice for a good\r\npainter, the Doge sent to him Gentile Bellini. With him he sent two\r\nassistants, and gave him honorable conduct in galleys belonging to the\r\nState. In Constantinople Gentile was much honored, and he painted the\r\nportraits of many remarkable people. At length it happened that when he\r\nhad finished a picture of the head of John the Baptist in a charger, and\r\nshowed it to the Sultan, that ruler said that the neck was not well\r\npainted, and when he saw that Gentile did not agree with him he called a\r\nslave and had his head instantly struck off, to prove to the artist what\r\nwould be the true action of the muscles under such circumstances. This act\r\nmade Gentile unwilling to remain near the Sultan, and after a year in his\r\nservice he returned home. Mehemet, at parting, gave him many gifts, and\r\nbegged him to ask for whatever would best please him. Gentile asked but\r\nfor a letter of praise to the Doge and Signoria of Venice. After his\r\nreturn to Venice he worked much in company with his brother. It is said\r\nthat Titian studied with Gentile: it is certain that he was always\r\noccupied with important commissions, and worked until the day of his\r\ndeath, when he was more than eighty years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--CHRIST. _By Gio. Bellini._]\r\n\r\nBut Giovanni Bellini was the greatest of his family, and must stand as the\r\nfounder of true Venetian painting. His works may be divided into two\r\nperiods, those that were done before, and those after he learned the use\r\nof oil colors. His masterpieces, which can still be seen in the Academy\r\nand the churches of Venice, were painted after he was sixty-five years\r\nold. The works of Giovanni Bellini are numerous in Venice, and are also\r\nseen in the principal galleries of Europe. He did not paint a great\r\nvariety of subjects, neither was his imagination very poetical, but there\r\nwas a moral beauty in his figures; he seems to have made humanity as\r\nelevated as it can be, and to have stopped just on the line which\r\nseparates earthly excellence from the heavenly. He often painted the\r\nsingle figure of Christ, of which Lübke says: \"By grand nobleness of\r\nexpression, solemn bearing, and an excellent arrangement of the drapery,\r\nhe reached a dignity which has rarely been surpassed.\" Near the close of\r\nhis life he painted a few subjects which represent gay and festive scenes,\r\nand are more youthful in spirit than the works of his earlier years. The\r\ntwo brothers were buried side by side, in the Church of SS. Giovanni e\r\nPaolo, in Venice.\r\n\r\nThere were also good painters in Padua, Ferrara, and Verona in the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nANDREA MANTEGNA, of Padua (1430-1506), was a very important artist. He\r\nspent the best part of his life in the service of the Duke of Mantua; but\r\nhis influence was felt in all Italy, for his marriage with the daughter of\r\nJacopo Bellini brought him into relations with many artists. His services\r\nwere sought by various sovereigns, whose offers he refused until Pope\r\nInnocent VIII. summoned him to Rome to paint a chapel in the Vatican.\r\nAfter two years there he returned to Mantua, where he died. His pictures\r\nare in all large collections; his finest works are madonnas at the Louvre,\r\nParis, and in the Church of St. Zeno at Verona. Mantegna was a fine\r\nengraver also, and his plates are now very valuable.\r\n\r\nIn the Umbrian school Pietro Perugino (1446-1524) was a notable painter;\r\nhe was important on account of his own work, and because he was the master\r\nof the great Raphael. His pictures were simple and devout in their spirit,\r\nand brilliant in color; in fact, he is considered as the founder of the\r\nstyle which Raphael perfected. His works are in the principal galleries of\r\nEurope, and he had many followers of whom we have not space to speak.\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO FRANCIA (1450-1518) was the founder of the school of Bologna.\r\nHis true name was Francisco di Marco Raibolini, and he was a goldsmith of\r\nrepute before he was a painter. He was also master of the mint to the\r\nBentivoglio and to Pope Julius II. at Bologna. It is not possible to say\r\nwhen he began to paint; but his earliest known work is dated 1490 or 1494,\r\nand is in the Gallery of Bologna. His pictures resemble those of Perugino\r\nand Raphael, and it is said that he died of sorrow because he felt himself\r\nso inferior to the great painter of Urbino. Raphael sent his St. Cecilia\r\nto Francia, and asked him to care for it and see it hung in its place; he\r\ndid so, but did not live long after this. It is well known that these two\r\nmasters were good friends and corresponded, but it is not certain that\r\nthey ever met. Francia's pictures are numerous; his portraits are\r\nexcellent. Many of his works are still in Bologna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--MADONNA. _By Perugino. In the Pitti Gallery,\r\nFlorence._]\r\n\r\nWe come now to one of the most celebrated masters of Italy, LEONARDO DA\r\nVINCI (1452-1519), the head of the Lombard or Milanese school. He was not\r\nthe equal of the great masters, Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Titian; but\r\nhe stands between them and the painters who preceded him or those of his\r\nown day.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, however, he was the most extraordinary man of his time.\r\nHis talents were many-sided; for he was not only a great artist, but also\r\na fine scholar in mathematics and mechanics; he wrote poetry and composed\r\nmusic, and was with all this so attractive personally, and so brilliant in\r\nhis manner, that he was a favorite wherever he went. It is probable that\r\nthis versatility prevented his being very great in any one thing, while he\r\nwas remarkable in many things.\r\n\r\nWhen still very young Leonardo showed his artistic talent. The paper upon\r\nwhich he worked out his sums was frequently bordered with little pictures\r\nwhich he drew while thinking on his lessons, and these sketches at last\r\nattracted his father's attention, and he showed them to his friend Andrea\r\nVerrocchio, an artist of Florence, who advised that the boy should become\r\na painter. Accordingly, in 1470, when eighteen years old, Leonardo was\r\nplaced under the care of Verrocchio, who was like a kind father to his\r\npupils: he was not only a painter, but also an architect and sculptor, a\r\nmusician and a geometer, and he especially excelled in making exquisite\r\ncups of gold and silver, crucifixes and statuettes such as were in great\r\ndemand for the use of the priesthood in those days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--LEONARDO DA VINCI. _From a drawing in red chalk\r\nby himself. In the Royal Library, Turin._]\r\n\r\nPietro Perugino was a fellow-pupil with Leonardo, and they two soon\r\nsurpassed their master in painting, and at last, when Verrocchio was\r\npainting a picture for the monks of Vallambrosa, and desired Leonardo to\r\nexecute an angel in it, the work of his pupil was so much better than his\r\nown that the old painter desired to throw his brush aside forever. The\r\npicture is now in the Academy of Florence, and represents \"The Baptism\r\nof Christ.\" With all his refinement and sweetness, Leonardo had a liking\r\nfor the horrible. It once happened that a countryman brought to his father\r\na circular piece of wood cut from a fig-tree, and desired to have it\r\npainted for a shield; it was handed over to Leonardo, who collected in his\r\nroom a number of lizards, snakes, bats, hedgehogs, and other frightful\r\ncreatures, and from these painted an unknown monster having certain\r\ncharacteristics of the horrid things he had about him. The hideous\r\ncreature was surrounded by fire, and was breathing out flames. When his\r\nfather saw it he ran away in a fright, and Leonardo was greatly pleased at\r\nthis. The countryman received an ordinary shield, and this _Rotello del\r\nFico_ (or shield of fig-tree wood) was sold to a merchant for one hundred\r\nducats, and again to the Duke of Milan for three times that sum. This\r\nshield has now been lost for more than three centuries; but another\r\nhorror, the \"Medusa's Head,\" is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and is\r\na head surrounded by interlacing serpents, the eyes being glassy and\r\ndeathlike and the mouth most revolting in expression.\r\n\r\nWhile in Florence Leonardo accomplished much, but was at times diverted\r\nfrom his painting by his love of science, sometimes making studies in\r\nastronomy and again in natural history and botany; he also went much into\r\nsociety, and lived extravagantly. He had the power to remember faces that\r\nhe had seen accidentally, and could make fine portraits from memory; he\r\nwas also accustomed to invite to his house people from the lower classes;\r\nhe would amuse them while he sketched their faces, making good portraits\r\nat times, and again ridiculous caricatures. He even went so far, for the\r\nsake of his art, as to accompany criminals to the place of execution, in\r\norder to study their expressions.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Leonardo wished to secure some fixed income, and wrote to the\r\nDuke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, called Il Moro, offering his services to\r\nthat prince. This resulted in his going to Milan, where he received a\r\ngenerous salary, and became very popular with the Duke and all the court,\r\nboth as a painter and as a gentleman. The Duke governed as the regent for\r\nhis young nephew, and gathered about him talented men for the benefit of\r\nthe young prince. He also led a gay life, and his court was the scene of\r\nconstant festivities. Leonardo's varied talents were very useful to the\r\nDuke; he could assist him in everything--by advice at his council, by\r\nplans for adorning his city, by music and poetry in his leisure hours, and\r\nby painting the portraits of his favorites. Some of these last are now\r\nfamous pictures--that of Lucrezia Crevelli is believed to be in the Louvre\r\nat Paris, where it is called \"La Belle Ferronière.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke conferred a great honor on Leonardo by choosing him to be the\r\nfounder and director of an academy which he had long wished to establish.\r\nIt was called the \"Academia Leonardi Vinci,\" and had for its purpose the\r\nbringing together of distinguished artists and men of letters. Leonardo\r\nwas appointed superintendent of all the fêtes and entertainments given by\r\nthe court, and in this department he did some marvellous things. He also\r\nsuperintended a great work in engineering which he brought to perfection,\r\nto the wonder of all Italy: it was no less an undertaking than bringing\r\nthe waters of the Adda from Mortisana to Milan, a distance of nearly two\r\nhundred miles. In spite of all these occupations the artist found time to\r\nstudy anatomy and to write some valuable works. At length Il Moro became\r\nthe established duke, and at his brilliant court Leonardo led a most\r\nagreeable life; but he was so occupied with many things that he painted\r\ncomparatively few pictures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--THE LAST SUPPER. _By Leonardo da Vinci._]\r\n\r\nAt length the Duke desired him to paint a picture of the Last Supper on\r\nthe wall of the refectory in the Convent of the Madonna delle Grazie. This\r\nwas his greatest work in Milan and a wonderful masterpiece. It was\r\ncommenced about 1496, and was finished in a very short time. We must now\r\njudge of it from copies and engravings, for it has been so injured as to\r\ngive no satisfaction to one who sees it. Some good copies were made before\r\nit was thus ruined, and numerous engravings make it familiar to all the\r\nworld. A copy in the Royal Academy, London, was made by one of Leonardo's\r\npupils, and is the size of the original. It is said that the prior of the\r\nconvent complained to the Duke of the length of time the artist was\r\nspending upon this picture; when the Duke questioned the painter he said\r\nthat he was greatly troubled to find a face which pleased him for that of\r\nJudas Iscariot; he added that he was willing to allow the prior to sit for\r\nthis figure and thus hasten the work; this answer pleased the Duke and\r\nsilenced the prior.\r\n\r\nAfter a time misfortunes overtook the Duke, and Leonardo was reduced to\r\npoverty; finally Il Moro was imprisoned; and in 1500 Leonardo returned to\r\nFlorence, where he was honorably received. He was not happy here, however,\r\nfor he was not the one important artist. He had been absent nineteen\r\nyears, and great changes had taken place; Michael Angelo and Raphael were\r\njust becoming famous, and they with other artists welcomed Leonardo, for\r\nhis fame had reached them from Milan. However, he painted some fine\r\npictures at this time; among them were the \"Adoration of the Kings,\" now\r\nin the Uffizi Gallery, and a portrait of Ginevra Benci, also in the same\r\ngallery. This lady must have been very beautiful; Ghirlandajo introduced\r\nher portrait into two of his frescoes.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable portrait was that known as Mona Lisa del Giocondo,\r\nwhich is in the Louvre, and is called by some critics the finest work of\r\nthis master. The lady was the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, a lovely\r\nwoman, and some suppose that she was very dear to Leonardo. He worked upon\r\nit for four years, and still thought it unfinished: the face has a deep,\r\nthoughtful expression--the eyelids are a little weary, perhaps, and\r\nthrough it all there is a suggestion of something not quite understood--a\r\nmystery: the hands are graceful and of perfect form, and the rocky\r\nbackground gives an unusual fascination to the whole picture. Leonardo\r\nmust have loved the picture himself, and it is not strange that he\r\nlavished more time upon it than he gave to the great picture of the Last\r\nSupper (Fig. 37).\r\n\r\nLeonardo sold this picture to Francis I. for nine thousand dollars, which\r\nwas then an enormous sum, though now one could scarcely fix a price upon\r\nit. In 1860 the Emperor of Russia paid twelve thousand dollars for a St.\r\nSebastian by Leonardo, and in 1865 a madonna by him was sold in Paris for\r\nabout sixteen thousand dollars. Of course his pictures are rarely sold;\r\nbut, when they are, great sums are given for them.\r\n\r\nIn 1502 Cæsar Borgia appointed Leonardo his engineer and sent him to\r\ntravel through Central Italy to inspect his fortresses; but this usurper\r\nsoon fled to Spain, and in 1503 our painter was again in Florence. In 1504\r\nhis father died. From 1507 to 1512 Leonardo was at the summit of his\r\ngreatness. Louis XII. appointed him his painter, and he labored for this\r\nmonarch also to improve the water-works of Milan. For seven years he dwelt\r\nat Milan, making frequent journeys to Florence. But the political troubles\r\nof the time made Lombardy an uncongenial home for any artist, and\r\nLeonardo, with a few pupils, went to Florence and then on to Rome. Pope\r\nLeo X. received him cordially enough, and told him to \"work for the glory\r\nof God, Italy, Leo X., and Leonardo da Vinci.\" But Leonardo was not happy\r\nin Rome, where Michael Angelo and Raphael were in great favor, and when\r\nFrancis I. made his successes in Italy in 1515, Leonardo hastened to\r\nLombardy to meet him. The new king of France restored him to the office to\r\nwhich Louis XII. had appointed him, and gave him an annual pension of\r\nseven hundred gold crowns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--MONA LISA.--\"LA BELLE JOCONDE.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen Francis returned to France he desired to cut out the wall on which\r\nthe Last Supper was painted, and carry it to his own country: this proved\r\nto be impossible, and it is much to be regretted, as it is probable that\r\nif it could have been thus removed it would have been better preserved.\r\nHowever, not being able to take the artist's great work, the king took\r\nLeonardo himself, together with his favorite pupils and friends and his\r\ndevoted servant. In France, Leonardo was treated with consideration. He\r\nresided near Amboise, where he could mingle with the court. It is said\r\nthat, old though he was, he was so much admired that the courtiers\r\nimitated his dress and the cut of his beard and hair. He was given the\r\ncharge of all artistic matters in France, and doubtless Francis hoped that\r\nhe would found an Academy as he had done at Milan. But he seems to have\r\nleft all his energy, all desire for work, on the Italian side of the Alps.\r\nHe made a few plans; but he brought no great thing to pass, and soon his\r\nhealth failed, and he fell into a decline. He gave great attention to\r\nreligious matters, received the sacrament, and then made his will, and put\r\nhis worldly affairs in order.\r\n\r\nThe king was accustomed to visit him frequently, and on the last day of\r\nhis life, when the sovereign entered the room, Leonardo desired to be\r\nraised up as a matter of respect to the king: sitting, he conversed of his\r\nsufferings, and lamented that he had done so little for God and man. Just\r\nthen he was seized with an attack of pain--the king rose to support him,\r\nand thus, in the arms of Francis, the great master breathed his last. This\r\nhas sometimes been doubted; but the modern French critics agree with the\r\nancient writers who give this account of his end.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in the Church of St. Florentin at Amboise, and it is not\r\nknown that any monument was erected over him. In 1808 the church was\r\ndestroyed; in 1863 Arsine Houssaye, with others, made a search for the\r\ngrave of Leonardo, and it is believed that his remains were found. In\r\n1873 a noble monument was erected in Milan to the memory of Da Vinci. It\r\nis near the entrance to the Arcade of Victor Emmanuel: the statue of the\r\nmaster stands on a high pedestal in a thoughtful attitude, the head bowed\r\ndown and the arms crossed on the breast. Below are other statues and rich\r\nbas-reliefs, and one inscription speaks of him as the \"Renewer of the Arts\r\nand Sciences.\"\r\n\r\nMany of his writings are in the libraries of Europe in manuscript form:\r\nhis best known work is the \"Trattato della Pittura,\" and has been\r\ntranslated into English. As an engineer his canal of Mortesana was enough\r\nto give him fame; as an artist he may be called the \"Poet of Painters,\"\r\nand, if those who followed him surpassed him, it should be remembered that\r\nit is easier to advance in a path once opened than to discover a new path.\r\nPersonally he was much beloved, and, though he lived when morals were at a\r\nlow estimate, he led a proper and reputable life. His pictures were pure\r\nin their spirit, and he seemed only to desire the progress of art and\r\nscience, and it is a pleasure to read and learn of him, as it is to see\r\nhis works.\r\n\r\nOther good artists of the Lombard school in the fifteenth century were\r\nBERNARDINO LUINI (about 1460-1530), who was the best pupil of Leonardo,\r\nGIOVANNI ANTONIO BELTRAFFIO (1467-1516), GAUDENZIO FARRARI (1484-1549),\r\nAMBROGIO BORGOGNONE (works dated about 1500), and ANDREA SOLARIO, whose\r\nage is not known.\r\n\r\nWe return now to the Florentine school at a time when the most remarkable\r\nperiod of its existence was about to begin. We shall speak first of FRA\r\nBARTOLOMMEO or BACCIO DELLA PORTA, also called IL FRATE (1469-1517). He\r\nwas born at Savignano, and studied at Florence under Cosimo Rosselli, but\r\nwas much influenced by the works of Leonardo da Vinci. This painter became\r\nfamous for the beauty of his pictures of the Madonna, and at the time\r\nwhen the great Savonarola went to Florence Bartolommeo was employed in the\r\nConvent of San Marco, where the preacher lived. The artist became the\r\ndevoted friend of the preacher, and, when the latter was seized, tortured,\r\nand burned, Bartolommeo became a friar, and left his pictures to be\r\nfinished by his pupil Albertinelli. For four years he lived the most\r\naustere life, and did not touch his brush: then his superior commanded him\r\nto resume his art; but the painter had no interest in it. About this time\r\nRaphael sought him out, and became his friend; he also instructed the monk\r\nin perspective, and in turn Raphael learned from him, for Fra Bartolommeo\r\nwas the first artist who used lay figures in arranging his draperies; he\r\nalso told Raphael some secrets of colors.\r\n\r\nAbout 1513 Bartolommeo went to Rome, and after his return to his convent\r\nhe began what promised to be a wonderful artistic career; but he only\r\nlived four years more, and the amount of his work was so small that his\r\npictures are now rare. His madonnas, saints, and angels are holy in their\r\neffect; his representations of architecture are grand, and while his works\r\nare not strong or powerful, they give much pleasure to those who see them.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL ANGELO BUONARROTI was born at the Castle of Caprese in 1475. His\r\nfather, who was of a noble family of Florence, was then governor of\r\nCaprese and Chiusi, and, when the Buonarroti household returned to\r\nFlorence, the little Angelo was left with his nurse on one of his father's\r\nestates at Settignano. The father and husband of his nurse were\r\nstone-masons, and thus in infancy the future artist was in the midst of\r\nblocks of stone and marble and the implements which he later used with so\r\nmuch skill. For many years rude sketches were shown upon the walls of the\r\nnurse's house made by her baby charge, and he afterward said that he\r\nimbibed a love for marble with his earliest food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--PORTRAIT OF MICHAEL ANGELO BUONARROTI.]\r\n\r\nAt the proper age Angelo was taken to Florence and placed in school; but\r\nhe spent his time mostly in drawing, and having made the acquaintance of\r\nFrancesco Granacci, at that time a pupil with Ghirlandajo, he borrowed\r\nfrom him designs and materials by which to carry on his beloved pursuits.\r\nMichael Angelo's desire to become an artist was violently opposed by his\r\nfather and his uncles, for they desired him to be a silk and woollen\r\nmerchant, and sustain the commercial reputation of the family. But so\r\ndetermined was he that finally his father yielded, and in 1488 placed him\r\nin the studio of Ghirlandajo. Here the boy of thirteen worked with great\r\ndiligence; he learned how to prepare colors and to lay the groundwork of\r\nfrescoes, and he was set to copy drawings. Very soon he wearied of this,\r\nand began to make original designs after his own ideas. At one time he\r\ncorrected a drawing of his master's: when he saw this, sixty years later,\r\nhe said, \"I almost think that I knew more of art in my youth than I do in\r\nmy old age.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Michael Angelo went to Ghirlandajo, that master was employed on the\r\nrestoration of the choir of Santa Maria Novella, so that the boy came at\r\nonce into the midst of important work. One day he drew a picture of the\r\nscaffolding and all that belonged to it, with the painters at work\r\nthereon: when his master saw it he exclaimed, \"He already understands more\r\nthan I do myself.\" This excellence in the scholar roused the jealousy of\r\nthe master, as well as of his other pupils, and it was a relief to Michael\r\nAngelo when, in answer to a request from Lorenzo de Medici, he and\r\nFrancesco Granacci were named by Ghirlandajo as his two most promising\r\nscholars, and were then sent to the Academy which the duke had\r\nestablished. The art treasures which Lorenzo gave for the use of the\r\nstudents were arranged in the gardens of San Marco, and here, under the\r\ninstruction of the old Bertoldo, Angelo forgot painting in his enthusiasm\r\nfor sculpture. He first copied the face of a faun; but he changed it\r\nsomewhat, and opened the mouth so that the teeth could be seen. When\r\nLorenzo visited the garden he praised the work, but said, \"You have made\r\nyour faun so old, and yet you have left him all his teeth; you should have\r\nknown that at such an advanced age there are generally some wanting.\" The\r\nnext time he came there was a gap in the teeth, and so well done that he\r\nwas delighted. This work is now in the Uffizi Gallery.\r\n\r\nLorenzo now sent for the father of Angelo, and asked that the son might\r\nlive in the Medici palace under his own care. Somewhat reluctantly the\r\nfather consented, and the duke gave him an office in the custom-house.\r\nFrom this time for three years, Angelo sat daily at the duke's table, and\r\nwas treated as one of his own family; he was properly clothed, and had an\r\nallowance of five ducats a month for pocket-money. It was the custom with\r\nLorenzo to give an entertainment every day; he took the head of the table,\r\nand whoever came first had a seat next him. It often happened that Michael\r\nAngelo had this place. Lorenzo was the head of Florence, and Florence was\r\nthe head of art, poetry, and all scholarly thought. Thus, in the home of\r\nthe Medici, the young artist heard learned talk upon all subjects of\r\ninterest; he saw there all the celebrated men who lived in the city or\r\nvisited it, and his life so near Lorenzo, for a thoughtful youth, as he\r\nwas, amounted to an education.\r\n\r\nThe society of Florence at this time was not of a high moral tone, and in\r\nthe year in which Michael Angelo entered the palace, a monk called\r\nSavonarola came to Florence to preach against the customs and the crimes\r\nof the city. Michael Angelo was much affected by this, and throughout his\r\nlong life remembered Savonarola with true respect and affection, and his\r\nbrother, Leonardo Buonarroti, was so far influenced that he withdrew from\r\nthe world and became a Dominican monk.\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo's diligence was great; he not only studied sculpture, but\r\nhe found time to copy some of the fine old frescoes in the Church of the\r\nCarmine. He gave great attention to the study of anatomy, and he was known\r\nthroughout the city for his talents, and for his pride and bad temper. He\r\nheld himself aloof from his fellow-pupils, and one day, in a quarrel with\r\nPiètro Torrigiano, the latter gave Angelo a blow and crushed his nose so\r\nbadly that he was disfigured for life. Torrigiano was banished for this\r\noffence and went to England; he ended his life in a Spanish prison.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1492 Lorenzo de Medici died. Michael Angelo was deeply\r\ngrieved at the loss of his best friend; he left the Medici palace, and\r\nopened a studio in his father's house, where he worked diligently for two\r\nyears, making a statue of Hercules and two madonnas. After two years there\r\ncame a great snow-storm, and Piero de Medici sent for the artist to make a\r\nsnow statue in his court-yard. He also invited Michael Angelo to live\r\nagain in the palace, and the invitation was accepted; but all was so\r\nchanged there that he embraced the first opportunity to leave, and during\r\na political disturbance fled from the city with two friends, and made his\r\nway to Venice. There he met the noble Aldovrandi of Bologna, who invited\r\nthe sculptor to his home, where he remained about a year, and then\r\nreturned to his studio in Florence.\r\n\r\nSoon after this he made a beautiful, sleeping Cupid, and when the young\r\nLorenzo de Medici saw it he advised Michael Angelo to bury it in the\r\nground for a season, and thus make it look like an antique marble; after\r\nthis was done, Lorenzo sent it to Rome and sold it to the Cardinal Riario,\r\nand gave the sculptor thirty ducats. In some way the truth of the matter\r\nreached the ears of the Cardinal, who sent his agent to Florence to find\r\nthe artist. When Michael Angelo heard that two hundred ducats had been\r\npaid for his Cupid, he knew that he had been deceived. The Cardinal's\r\nagent invited him to go to Rome, and he gladly went. The oldest existing\r\nwriting from the hand of Michael Angelo is the letter which he wrote to\r\nLorenzo to inform him of his arrival in Rome. He was then twenty-one years\r\nold, and spoke with joy of all the beautiful things he had seen.\r\n\r\nNot long after he reached Rome he made the statue of the \"Drunken\r\nBacchus,\" now in the Uffizi Gallery, and then the Virgin Mary sitting near\r\nthe place of the cross and holding the body of the dead Christ. The\r\nart-term for this subject is \"La Pietà.\" From the time that Michael Angelo\r\nmade this beautiful work he was the first sculptor of the world, though he\r\nwas but twenty-four years old. The Pietà was placed in St. Peter's Church,\r\nwhere it still remains. The next year he returned to Florence. He was\r\noccupied with both painting and sculpture, and was soon employed on his\r\n\"David,\" one of his greatest works. This statue weighed eighteen thousand\r\npounds, and its removal from the studio in which it was made to the place\r\nwhere it was to stand, next the gate of the Palazzo Vecchio, was a\r\ndifficult undertaking. It was at last put in place on May 18, 1504; there\r\nit remained until a few years ago, when, on account of its crumbling from\r\nthe effect of the weather, it was removed to the Academy of Fine Arts by\r\nmeans of a railroad built for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a rivalry sprang up between Michael Angelo and Leonardo da\r\nVinci. They were very unlike in their characters and mode of life. Michael\r\nAngelo was bitter, ironical, and liked to be alone; Leonardo loved to be\r\ngay and to see the world; Michael Angelo lived so that when he was old he\r\nsaid, \"Rich as I am, I have always lived like a poor man;\" Leonardo\r\nenjoyed luxury, and kept a fine house, with horses and servants. They had\r\nentered into a competition which was likely to result in serious trouble,\r\nwhen Pope Julius II. summoned Michael Angelo to Rome. The Pope gave him an\r\norder to build him a splendid tomb; but the enemies of the sculptor made\r\ntrouble for him, and one morning he was refused admission to the Pope's\r\npalace. He then left Rome, sending this letter to the Pope: \"Most Holy\r\nFather, I was this morning driven from the palace by the order of your\r\nHoliness. If you require me in future you can seek me elsewhere than at\r\nRome.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went to Florence, and the Pope sent for him again and again; but\r\nhe did not go. Meantime he finished his design, and received the\r\ncommission that he and Leonardo had striven for, which was to decorate the\r\nhall of the Grand Council with pictures. At last, in 1506, the Pope was in\r\nBologna, and again sent for Michael Angelo. He went, and was forgiven for\r\nhis offence, and received an order for a colossal statue of the Pope in\r\nbronze. When this was finished in 1508, and put before the Church of St.\r\nPetronio, Michael Angelo returned to Florence. He had not made friends in\r\nBologna; his forbidding manner did not encourage others to associate with\r\nhim; but we now know from his letters that he had great trials. His family\r\nwas poor, and all relied on him; indeed, his life was full of care and\r\nsadness.\r\n\r\nIn 1508 he was again summoned to Rome by the Pope, who insisted that he\r\nshould paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, in the Vatican. Michael\r\nAngelo did not wish to do this, as he had done no great painting. It\r\nproved to be one of his most famous works; but he had a great deal of\r\ntrouble in it. On one occasion the Pope threatened to throw the artist\r\nfrom the scaffolding. The Pope complained also that the pictures looked\r\npoor; to this the artist replied: \"They are only poor people whom I have\r\npainted there, and did not wear gold on their garments.\" His subjects were\r\nfrom the Bible. When the artist would have a leave of absence to go to\r\nFlorence, the Pope got so angry that he struck him; but, in spite of all,\r\nthis great painting was finished in 1512. Grimm, in his life of Michael\r\nAngelo, says: \"It needed the meeting of these two men; in the one such\r\nperseverance in requiring, and in the other such power of fulfilling, to\r\nproduce this monument of human art.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--THE PROPHET JEREMIAH. _By M. Angelo. From the\r\nSistine Chapel._]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to follow, step by step, the life and works of this\r\nmaster. Among the other great things which he did are the tomb of Julius\r\nII. in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, of which the famous\r\nstatue of Moses makes a part (Fig. 40).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--STATUE OF MOSES. _By M. Angelo._]\r\n\r\nHe made the statues in the Medici Chapel in the Church of San Lorenzo, in\r\nFlorence, the painting of the Last Judgment on a wall of the Sistine\r\nChapel, and many works as an architect; for he was called upon to attend\r\nto fortifications both in Florence and Rome, and at last, as his\r\ngreatest work of this sort, he was the architect of St. Peter's at Rome.\r\nMany different artists had had a share in this work; but as it now is\r\nMichael Angelo may be counted as its real architect. His works are\r\nnumerous and only a small part of them is here mentioned; but I have\r\nspoken of those by which he is most remembered. His life, too, was a\r\nstormy one for many reasons that we have not space to tell. While he lived\r\nthere were wars and great changes in Italy; he served also under nine\r\npopes, and during his life thirteen men occupied the papal chair. Besides\r\nbeing great as a painter, an architect, and a sculptor, he was a poet, and\r\nwrote sonnets well worthy of such a genius as his. His whole life was so\r\nserious and sad that it gives one joy to know that in his old age he\r\nformed an intimate friendship with Vittoria Colonna, a wonderful woman,\r\nwho made a sweet return to him for all the tender devotion which he\r\nlavished upon her.\r\n\r\nItalians associate the name of Michael Angelo with those of the divine\r\npoet Dante and the painter Raphael, and these three are spoken of as the\r\nthree greatest men of their country in what are called the modern days.\r\nMichael Angelo died at Rome in 1564, when eighty-nine years old. He\r\ndesired to be buried in Florence; but his friends feared to let this be\r\nknown lest the Pope should forbid his removal. He was therefore buried in\r\nthe Church of the Holy Apostles; but his nephew, Leonardo Buonarroti,\r\nconveyed his remains to Florence secretly, disguised as a bale of\r\nmerchandise. At Florence, on a Sunday night, his body was borne to Santa\r\nCroce, in a torchlight procession, and followed by many thousands of\r\ncitizens. There his friends once more gazed upon the face which had not\r\nbeen seen in Florence for thirty years; he looked as if quietly sleeping.\r\nSome days later a splendid memorial service was held in San Lorenzo,\r\nattended by all the court, the artists, scholars, and eminent men of the\r\ncity. An oration was pronounced; rare statues and paintings were\r\ncollected in the church; all the shops of the city were closed; and the\r\nsquares were filled with people.\r\n\r\nAbove his grave in Santa Croce, where he lies near Dante, Machiavelli,\r\nGalileo, and many other great men, the Duke and Leonardo Buonarroti\r\nerected a monument. It has statues of Painting, Sculpture, and\r\nArchitecture, and a bust of the great man who sleeps beneath.\r\n\r\nIn the court of the Uffizi his statue stands together with those of other\r\ngreat Florentines. His house in the Ghibelline Street now belongs to the\r\ncity of Florence, and contains many treasured mementoes of his life and\r\nworks; it is open to all who wish to visit it. In 1875 a grand festival\r\nwas held in Florence to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of his\r\nbirth. The ceremonies were very impressive, and at that time some\r\ndocuments which related to his life, and had never been opened, were, by\r\ncommand of Victor Emmanuel, given to proper persons to be examined.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the great deeds of great men live on and on, through all\r\ntime, and it is a joy to know that though the fourscore and nine years of\r\nthe life of this artist had much of care and sorrow in them, his name and\r\nmemory are still cherished, and must continue to be, while from his life\r\nmany lessons may be drawn to benefit and encourage others--lessons which\r\nwe cannot here write out; but they teach patience, industry, and\r\nfaithfulness to duty, while they also warn us to avoid the bitterness and\r\nroughness which are blemishes on the memory of this great, good man.\r\n\r\nDANIELE DE VOLTERRA (1509-1566) was the best scholar of Michael Angelo.\r\nHis principal pictures are the \"Descent from the Cross,\" in the Church of\r\nTrinità di Monti, in Rome, and the \"Massacre of the Innocents,\" in the\r\nUffizi Gallery; both are celebrated works.\r\n\r\nThe next important Florentine painter was ANDREA DEL SARTO (1488-1530).\r\nHis family name was Vannucchi; but because his father was a tailor, the\r\nItalian term for one of his trade, _un sarto_, came to be used for the\r\nson. Early in life Andrea was a goldsmith, as were so many artists; but,\r\nwhen he was able to study painting under Pietro di Cosimo, he became\r\ndevoted to it, and soon developed his own style, which was very soft and\r\npleasing. His pictures cannot be called great works of art, but they are\r\nfavorites with a large number of people. He succeeded in fresco-painting,\r\nand decorated several buildings in Florence, among them the Scalzo, which\r\nwas a place where the Barefooted Friars held their meetings, and was named\r\nfrom them, as they are called _Scalzi_. These frescoes are now much\r\ninjured; but they are thought his best works of this kind.\r\n\r\nProbably Andrea del Sarto would have come to be a better painter if he had\r\nbeen a happier man. His wife, of whom he was very fond, was a mean,\r\nselfish woman who wished only to make a great show, and did not value her\r\nhusband's talents except for the money which they brought him. She even\r\ninfluenced him to desert his parents, to whom he had ever been a dutiful\r\nson. About 1518 Francis I., king of France, invited Andrea to Paris to\r\nexecute some works for him. The painter went, and was well established\r\nthere and very popular, when his wife insisted that he should return to\r\nFlorence. Francis I. was very unwilling to spare him, but Andrea dared not\r\nrefuse to go to his wife; so he solemnly took an oath to return to Paris\r\nand bring his wife, so that he could remain as long as pleased the king,\r\nand then that sovereign consented. Francis also gave the artist a large\r\nsum of money to buy for him all sorts of beautiful objects.\r\n\r\nWhen Andrea reached Florence his wife refused to go to France, and\r\npersuaded him to give her the king's money. She soon spent it, and Andrea,\r\nwho lived ten years more, was very unhappy, while the king never forgave\r\nhim, and to this day this wretched story must be told, and continues the\r\nremembrance of his dishonesty. After all he had sacrificed for his wife,\r\nwhen he became very ill, in 1530, of some contagious disease, she deserted\r\nhim. He died alone, and with no prayer or funeral was buried in the\r\nConvent of the Nunziata, where he had painted some of his frescoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--THE MADONNA DEL SACCO. _By Andrea del Sarto._]\r\n\r\nHis pictures are very numerous; they are correct in drawing, very softly\r\nfinished, and have a peculiar gray tone of color. He painted a great\r\nnumber of Holy Families, one of which is called the \"Madonna del Sacco,\"\r\nbecause St. Joseph is leaning on a sack (Fig. 41). This is in the convent\r\nwhere he is buried. His best work is called the \"Madonna di San Francesco\"\r\nand hangs in the tribune of the Uffizi Gallery. This is a most honorable\r\nplace, for near it are pictures by Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, and\r\nother great painters, as well as some very celebrated statues, such as the\r\n\"Venus de Medici\" and the \"Dancing Faun.\" Andrea del Sarto's pictures of\r\nthe Madonna and Child are almost numberless; they are sweet, attractive\r\nworks, as are also his St. Barbara, St. Agnes, and others of his single\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nWe will now leave the Florentine school of the sixteenth century, and\r\nspeak of the great master of the Roman school, RAPHAEL SANZIO, or SANTI\r\n(1483-1520), who was born at Urbino on Good Friday. His father was a\r\npainter, and Raphael showed his taste for art very early in life. Both his\r\nparents died while he was still a child, and though he must have learned\r\nsomething from seeing his father and other painters at their work, we say\r\nthat Perugino was his first master, for he was but twelve years old when\r\nhe entered the studio of that painter in Perugia.\r\n\r\nHere he remained more than eight years, and about the time of leaving\r\npainted the very celebrated picture called \"Lo Sposalizio,\" or the\r\nMarriage of the Virgin, now in the Brera at Milan. This picture is famous\r\nthe world over, and is very important in the life of the painter, because\r\nit shows the highest point he reached under Perugino, or during what is\r\ncalled his first manner in painting. Before this he had executed a large\r\nnumber of beautiful pictures, among which was the so-called \"Staffa\r\nMadonna.\" This is a circular picture and represents the Virgin walking in\r\na springtime landscape. It remained in the Staffa Palace in Perugia three\r\nhundred and sixty-eight years, and in 1871 was sold to the Emperor of\r\nRussia for seventy thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIn 1504 Raphael returned to Urbino, where he became the favorite of the\r\ncourt, and was much employed by the ducal family. To this time belong the\r\n\"St. George Slaying the Dragon\" and the \"St. Michael Attacking Satan,\" now\r\nin the gallery of the Louvre. But the young artist soon grew weary of the\r\nnarrowness of his life, and went to Florence, where, amid the treasures of\r\nart with which that city was crowded, he felt as if he was in an enchanted\r\nland. It is worth while to recount the wonderful things he saw; they were\r\nthe cathedral with the dome of Brunelleschi, the tower of Giotto, the\r\nmarbles and bronzes of Donatello, the baptistery gates of Ghiberti, the\r\npictures of Masaccio, Ghirlandajo, Fra Angelico, and many other older\r\nmasters, while Michael Angelo and Leonardo were surprising themselves and\r\nall others with their beautiful works.\r\n\r\nAt this time the second manner of Raphael begun. During his first winter\r\nhere he painted the so-called \"Madonna della Gran Duca,\" now in the Pitti\r\nGallery, and thus named because the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand III.,\r\ncarried it with him on all his journeys, and said his prayers before it at\r\nmorning and evening. He made a visit to Urbino in 1505, and wherever he\r\nwas he worked continually, and finished a great number of pictures, which\r\nas yet were of religious subjects with few and unimportant exceptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--PORTRAIT OF RAPHAEL. _Painted by Himself._]\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Florence in 1506, the cartoon of Leonardo da Vinci's\r\n\"Battle of the Standard\" and Michael Angelo's \"Bathing Soldiers\" revealed\r\na new world of art to Raphael. He saw that heroic, exciting scenes could\r\nbe represented by painting, and that vigor and passion could speak from\r\nthe canvas as powerfully as Christian love and resignation. Still he did\r\nnot attempt any new thing immediately. In Florence he moved in the best\r\ncircles. He received orders for some portraits of nobles and wealthy men,\r\nas well as for madonnas and Holy Families. Before long he visited Bologna,\r\nand went again to Urbino, which had become a very important city under the\r\nreign of Duke Guidobaldo. The king of England, Henry VIII., had sent to\r\nthis duke the decoration of the Order of the Garter. In return for this\r\nhonor, the duke sent the king rich gifts, among which was a picture of St.\r\nGeorge and the Dragon by Raphael.\r\n\r\nWhile at Urbino, at this time, he painted his first classic subject, the\r\n\"Three Graces.\" Soon after, he returned the third time to Florence, and\r\nnow held much intercourse with Fra Bartolommeo, who gave the younger\r\nartist valuable instruction as to his color and drapery. In 1508, among a\r\ngreat number of pictures he painted the madonna which is called \"La Belle\r\nJardinière,\" and is now one of the treasures of the Louvre. The Virgin is\r\npictured in the midst of a flowery landscape, and it has been said that a\r\nbeautiful flower-girl to whom Raphael was attached was his model for the\r\npicture. This picture is also a landmark in the history of Raphael, for it\r\nshows the perfection of his second manner, and the change that had come\r\nover him from his Florentine experience and associations. His earlier\r\npictures had been full of a sweet, unearthly feeling, and a color which\r\ncould be called spiritual was spread over them; now his madonnas were like\r\nbeautiful, earthly mothers, his colors were deep and rich, and his\r\nlandscapes were often replaced by architectural backgrounds which gave a\r\nstately air where all before had been simplicity. His skill in grouping,\r\nin color, and in drapery was now marvellous, and when in 1508 the Pope,\r\nwho had seen some of his works, summoned him to Rome, he went, fully\r\nprepared for the great future which was before him, and now began his\r\nthird, or Roman manner of painting.\r\n\r\nThis pope was Julius II., who held a magnificent court and was ambitious\r\nfor glory in every department of life--as a temporal as well as a\r\nspiritual ruler, and as a patron of art and letters as well as in his\r\noffice of the Protector of the Holy Church. He had vast designs for the\r\nadornment of Rome, and immediately employed Raphael in the decoration of\r\nthe first of the Stanze, or halls of the Vatican, four of which he\r\nornamented with magnificent frescoes before his death. He also executed\r\nwall-paintings in the Chigi Palace, and in a chapel of the Church of Santa\r\nMaria della Pace.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a short visit to Florence, Raphael passed the\r\nremainder of his life in Rome. The amount of work which he did as an\r\narchitect, sculptor, and painter was marvellous, and would require the\r\nspace of a volume to follow it, and name all his achievements, step by\r\nstep, so I shall only tell you of some of his best-known works and those\r\nwhich are most often mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhile he was working upon the halls of the Vatican Julius II. died. He was\r\nsucceeded by Leo X., who also was a generous patron to Raphael, who thus\r\nsuffered no loss of occupation from the change of popes. The artist became\r\nvery popular and rich; he had many pupils, and was assisted by them in his\r\ngreat frescoes, not only in the Vatican, but also in the Farnesina Villa\r\nor Chigi Palace. Raphael had the power to attach men to him with devoted\r\naffection, and his pupils gave him personal service gladly; he was often\r\nseen in the street with numbers of them in attendance, just as the nobles\r\nwere followed by their squires and pages. He built himself a house in a\r\nquarter of the city called the Borgo, not far from the Church of St.\r\nPeter's, and during the remainder of his life was attended by prosperity\r\nand success.\r\n\r\nOne of the important works which he did for Leo X. was the making of\r\ncartoons, or designs to be executed in tapestry for the decoration of the\r\nSistine Chapel, where Michael Angelo had painted his great frescoes. The\r\nPope ordered these tapestries to be woven in the looms of Flanders, from\r\nthe richest materials, and a quantity of gold thread was used in them.\r\nThey were completed and sent to Rome in 1519, and were exhibited to the\r\npeople the day after Christmas, when all the city flocked to see them. In\r\n1527, when the Constable de Bourbon allowed the French soldiers to sack\r\nRome, these tapestries were carried away. In 1553 they were restored; but\r\none was missing, and it is believed that it had been destroyed for the\r\nsake of the gold thread which was in it. Again, in 1798, the French\r\ncarried them away and sold them to a Jew in Leghorn, who burned one of the\r\npieces; but his gain in gold was so little that he preserved the others,\r\nand Pius VII. bought them and restored them to the Vatican. The cartoons,\r\nhowever, are far more important than the tapestries, because they are the\r\nwork of Raphael himself. The weavers at Arras tossed them aside after\r\nusing them, and some were torn; but a century later the artist Rubens\r\nlearned that they existed, and advised King Charles I. of England to buy\r\nthem. This he did, and thus the cartoons met with as many ups and downs as\r\nthe tapestries had had. When they reached England they were in strips; the\r\nworkmen had cut them for their convenience. After the king was executed\r\nCromwell bought the cartoons for three hundred pounds. When Charles II.\r\nwas king and in great need of money he was sorely tempted to sell them to\r\nLouis XIV., who coveted them, and wished to add them to the treasures of\r\nFrance; but Lord Danby persuaded Charles to keep them. In 1698 they were\r\nbarely saved from fire at Whitehall, and finally, by command of William\r\nIII., they were properly repaired and a room was built at Hampton Court to\r\nreceive them, by the architect, Sir Christopher Wren. At present they are\r\nin the South Kensington Museum, London. Of the original eleven only seven\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--THE SISTINE MADONNA.]\r\n\r\nBoth Henry VIII. and Francis I. had received presents of pictures by\r\nRaphael: we have told of the occasion when the St. George was sent to\r\nEngland. The \"Archangel Michael\" and the \"Large Holy Family of the Louvre\"\r\nwere given to Francis I. by Lorenzo de Medici, who sent them overland on\r\nmules to the Palace of Fontainebleau. Francis was so charmed with these\r\nworks that he presented Raphael so large a sum that he was unwilling to\r\naccept it without sending the king still other pictures; so he sent the\r\nsovereign another painting, and to the king's sister, Queen Margaret of\r\nNavarre, he gave a picture of St. Margaret overcoming the dragon. Then\r\nFrancis gave Raphael many thanks and another rich gift of money. Besides\r\nthis he invited Raphael to come to his court, as did also the king of\r\nEngland; but the artist preferred to remain where he was already so\r\nprosperous and happy.\r\n\r\nAbout 1520 Raphael painted the famous Sistine Madonna, now the pride of\r\nthe Dresden Gallery. It is named from St. Sixtus, for whose convent, at\r\nPiacenza, it was painted: the picture of this saint, too, is in the lower\r\npart of the picture, with that of St. Barbara. No sketch or drawing of\r\nthis work was ever found, and it is believed that the great artist,\r\nworking as if inspired, sketched it and finished it on the canvas where it\r\nis. It was originally intended for a _drappellone_, or procession\r\nstandard, but the monks used it for an altar-piece (Fig. 43).\r\n\r\nWhile Raphael accomplished so much as a painter, he by no means gave all\r\nhis time or thought to a single art. He was made superintendent of the\r\nbuilding of St. Peter's in 1514, and made many architectural drawings for\r\nthat church; he was also much interested in the excavations of ancient\r\nRome, and made immense numbers of drawings of various sorts. As a sculptor\r\nhe made models and designs, and there is in the Church of Santa Maria del\r\nPopolo, in Rome, a statue of Jonah sitting on a whale, said to have been\r\nmodelled by Raphael and put into marble by Lorenzetto Latti.\r\n\r\nRaphael was also interested in what was happening outside the world of\r\nart; he corresponded with scholars of different countries, and sent men to\r\nmake drawings of places and objects which he could not go to see. He was\r\nalso generous to those less fortunate than himself, and gave encouragement\r\nand occupation to many needy men.\r\n\r\nAt one time he expected to marry Maria de Bibiena, a niece of Cardinal\r\nBibiena; but she died before the time for the marriage came.\r\n\r\nWhile Raphael was making his great successes in Rome, other famous artists\r\nalso were there, and there came to be much discussion as to their merits,\r\nand especially as to the comparative worth of Michael Angelo and Raphael.\r\nAt last, when this feeling of rivalry was at its height, the Cardinal\r\nGiulio de Medici, afterward Pope Clement VII., gave orders to Raphael and\r\nSebastian del Piombo to paint two large pictures for the Cathedral of\r\nNarbonne. The subject of Sebastian's picture was the \"Raising of Lazarus,\"\r\nand it has always been said that Michael Angelo made the drawing for it.\r\n\r\nRaphael's picture was the \"Transfiguration,\" and proved to be his last\r\nwork, for before it was finished he was attacked by fever, and died on\r\nGood Friday, 1620, which was the thirty-seventh anniversary of his birth.\r\nAll Rome mourned for him; his body was laid in state, and the\r\nTransfiguration was placed near it. Those who had known him went to weep\r\nwhile they gazed upon his face for the last time.\r\n\r\nHe had chosen his grave in the Pantheon, near to that of Maria Bibiena,\r\nhis betrothed bride. The ceremonies of his burial were magnificent, and\r\nhis body was followed by an immense throng dressed in mourning. Above his\r\ntomb was placed an inscription in Latin, written by Pietro Bembo, which\r\nhas for its last sentence these words: \"This is that Raphael by whom\r\nNature feared to be conquered while he lived, and to die when he died.\"\r\nRaphael had also requested Lorenzo Lorenzetti to make a statue of the\r\nVirgin to be placed above his resting-place. He left a large estate, and\r\ngave his works of art to his pupils Giulio Romano and Francesco Penni; his\r\nhouse to Cardinal Bibiena; a sum to buy another house, the rent of which\r\nshould pay for twelve masses to be said monthly, for the repose of his\r\nsoul, from the altar near his grave; this was observed until 1705, when\r\nthe income from the house was not enough to support these services.\r\n\r\nFor many years there was a skull at the Academy of St. Luke, in Rome,\r\nwhich was called that of Raphael; but there was no proof of this, and in\r\n1833 some antiquarians received the consent of the Pope to their searching\r\nfor the bones of Raphael in his grave in the Pantheon. After five days of\r\ncareful work, and removing the pavement in several places, the skeleton of\r\nthe great master was found, and with it such proofs of its being his as\r\nleft no room for doubt. Then a second great funeral service was held; the\r\nPope, Gregory XVI., gave a marble sarcophagus in which the bones were\r\nplaced, and reverently restored to their first resting-place. More than\r\nthree thousand persons were present at the service, including artists of\r\nall nations, as well as Romans of the highest rank. They moved in\r\nprocession about the church, bearing torches in their hands, and keeping\r\ntime to beautiful chants from an invisible choir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--SAINT CECILIA LISTENING TO THE SINGING OF ANGELS.\r\n_By Raphael._]\r\n\r\nRaphael left two hundred and eighty-seven pictures and five hundred and\r\nseventy-six studies and drawings, and all done in so short a life. In\r\nconsidering him and the story of his life, we find that it was not any one\r\ntrait or talent that made his greatness; but it was the rare union of\r\ngifts of genius with a personal charm that won all hearts to him. His\r\nfamous picture of \"St. Cecilia,\" with its sweetness of expression and\r\nlovely color--its union of earthly beauty with spiritual feeling, is a\r\nsymbol of the harmonious and varied qualities of this prince of painters\r\n(Fig. 44).\r\n\r\nGIULIO ROMANO (1492-1556) was the favorite pupil of Raphael, and the heir\r\nof a part of his estate; but his remaining works would not repay us for a\r\nstudy of them.\r\n\r\nOf course, the influence of so great a master as Raphael was felt outside\r\nof his own school, and, in a sense, all Italian art of his time was\r\nmodified by him. His effect was very noticeable upon a Sienese painter,\r\nBAZZI, or RAZZI, called IL SODOMA (1477-1549), who went to Rome and was\r\nunder the immediate influence of Raphael's works. He was almost unrivalled\r\nin his power to represent beautiful female heads.\r\n\r\nHis important works were frescoes, many of which are in the churches of\r\nSiena. Doubtless Bazzi was lost in the shadow of the great Raphael, and\r\nhad he existed at a time a little more distant from that great man, he\r\nwould have been more famous in his life.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century the Venetian school reached its highest\r\nexcellence. The great difference between it and the school of Florence\r\nwas, that the latter made beauty of form the one object of its art, while\r\nthe Venetian painters combined with grace and ease the added charm of\r\nrich, brilliant color.\r\n\r\nGIORGIO BARBARELLI, called GIORGIONE (1477-1511), was the first great\r\nartist of Venice who cast off the rigid manner of the Bellini school, and\r\nused his brush and colors freely, guided only by his own ideas, and\r\ninspired by his own genius.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Castelfranco, and was early distinguished for his personal\r\nbeauty. Giorgione means George the Great, and this title was given him on\r\naccount of his noble figure. He was fond of music, played the lute well,\r\nand composed many of the songs he sang; he had also an intense love of\r\nbeauty--in short, his whole nature was full of sentiment and harmony, and\r\nwith all these gifts he was a man of pure life. Mrs. Jameson says of him:\r\n\"If Raphael be the Shakspeare, then Giorgione may be styled the Byron of\r\npainting.\"\r\n\r\nThere is little that can be told of his life. He was devoted to his art,\r\nand passionately in love with a young girl, of whom he told one of his\r\nartist friends, Morto da Feltri. This last proved a traitor to Giorgione,\r\nfor he too admired the same girl, and induced her to forsake Giorgione,\r\nand go away with him. The double treachery of his beloved and his friend\r\ncaused the painter such grief that he could not overcome his sadness, and\r\nwhen the plague visited Venice in 1511, he fell a victim to it in the very\r\nflower of his age.\r\n\r\nMuch of the work of Giorgione has disappeared, for he executed frescoes\r\nwhich the damp atmosphere of Venice has destroyed or so injured that they\r\nare of no value. His smaller pictures were not numerous, and there is much\r\ndispute as to the genuineness of those that are called by his name. He\r\npainted very few historical subjects; his works are principally portraits,\r\nsibyls, and religious pictures. Among the last, the altar-piece at\r\nCastelfranco holds the first place; it represents the Virgin and Child\r\nbetween Sts. Francis and Liberale, and was painted before 1504.\r\n\r\nGiorgione gave an elevated tone to his heads and figures; it seemed as if\r\nhe painted only the beings of a superior race, and as if they must all be\r\nfitted to do great deeds. His fancy was very fruitful, and in some of his\r\nworks he pictured demons, sea-monsters, dogs, apes, and such creatures\r\nwith great effect. In clearness and warmth of color Giorgione is at the\r\nhead of the Venetian painters; in truth, it seems as if the color was\r\nwithin them and showed itself without in a deep, luminous glow.\r\n\r\nThe most important of Giorgione's scholars was called FRA SEBASTIANO DEL\r\nPIOMBO; his real name was _Luciani_, and he was a native of Venice\r\n(1485-1547). This artist excelled in his coloring and in the effect he\r\ngave to the atmosphere of his work, making it a broad _chiaro-scuro_, or\r\nclear-obscure, as it really means. This is an art term which is frequently\r\nused, and denotes a sort of mistiness which has some light in it, and is\r\ngradually shaded off, either into a full light or a deep shadow. But from\r\nthe earliest efforts of this artist, it was plain that he had no gift of\r\ncomposition, neither could he give his pictures an elevated tone or\r\neffect. For this reason his portraits were his best works, and these were\r\nvery fine.\r\n\r\nA portrait of his in the National Gallery, London, and another in the\r\nStädel Gallery at Frankfort, are both said to be of Giulia Gonzaga, the\r\nmost beautiful woman of her day in Italy. In 1553, Ippolito de Medici, who\r\nwas madly in love with her, sent Sebastian with an armed force to Fondi to\r\npaint her portrait; it was finished in a month, and was said to be the\r\nbest ever painted by Sebastian. It was sent to France as a gift to Francis\r\nI., and its present abiding-place is not known.\r\n\r\nWhile Raphael was at the height of his fame in Rome, the banker Chigi\r\ninvited Sebastian to that city, and in the Farnesina he painted works\r\nwhich were very inferior beside Raphael's. Then Sebastian tried to improve\r\nby study under Michael Angelo. This last great master would not compete\r\nwith Raphael himself, but he was very jealous of the fame of the younger\r\nman, and it is said that he aided Sebastian, and even made his designs for\r\nhim, in the hopes that thus he might eclipse Raphael. We have spoken of\r\none large picture of the \"Raising of Lazarus\" said to have been made from\r\nMichael Angelo's design, which Sebastian colored; it was painted in\r\ncompetition with Raphael's Transfiguration, and even beside that most\r\nsplendid work the Lazarus was much admired. This is now in the National\r\nGallery, London.\r\n\r\nAfter Raphael's death Sebastian was called the first painter in Rome, and\r\nwas made a _piombatore_. It was necessary to be an ecclesiastic to hold\r\nthis office, and it is on account of this that he gave up his real name,\r\nand became a friar. He wrote to Michael Angelo: \"If you were to see me as\r\nan honorable lord, you would laugh at me. I am the finest ecclesiastic in\r\nall Rome. Such a thing had never come into my mind. But God be praised in\r\neternity! He seemed especially to have thus decreed it. And, therefore, so\r\nbe it.\" It is not strange that he should have been so resigned to a high\r\noffice and a salary of eight hundred scudi a year!\r\n\r\nAnother Venetian, of the same time with Giorgione, was JACOPO PALMA,\r\ncalled IL VECCHIO, or the elder (about 1480-1528). He was born near\r\nBergamo, but as an artist he was a Venetian. We do not know with whom he\r\nstudied, and he was not a very great man, nor was he employed by the\r\nstate--but he dwelt much in the palaces of noble families and did much\r\nwork for them. When he died he left forty-four unfinished paintings.\r\n\r\nHis female figures are his best works, and one of his fine pictures at\r\nDresden, called the \"Three Graces,\" is said to represent his daughters.\r\nThe work which is usually called his masterpiece is an altar-piece in the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria Formosa, in Venice; the St. Barbara in the centre is\r\nvery beautiful, and is said to have been painted from his daughter\r\nViolante.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--PORTRAIT OF TITIAN. _From the etching by Agostino\r\nCaracci._]\r\n\r\nThe greatest master of the Venetian school is called TITIAN, though his\r\nreal name was TIZIANO VECELLI, and sometimes Cadore is added to this,\r\nbecause of his having been born in that village (1477-1576). His family\r\nwas noble and their castle was called Lodore, and was in the midst of a\r\nlarge estate surrounded by small houses; in one of these last, which is\r\nstill preserved, the painter was born.\r\n\r\nAs a child he was fond of drawing, and so anxious to color his pictures\r\nthat he squeezed the juices from certain flowers, and used them as paints.\r\nWhen but nine years old he was taken to Venice to study, and from this\r\ntime was called a Venetian; he is said by some writers to be the first\r\nportrait-painter of the world.\r\n\r\nHe first studied under Sebastian Zuccato, and then under the Bellini,\r\nwhere he was a fellow-pupil with Giorgione, and the two became devoted\r\nfriends, at the time when they were just coming to be men and were filled\r\nwith glad hopes of future greatness. After a time, when Titian was about\r\nthirty years old, the two were employed on the \"Fondaco dei Tedeschi,\" or\r\nthe exchange for German merchants in Venice. Here the frescoes of Titian\r\nwere more admired than those of Giorgione, and the latter became so\r\njealous that they ceased to live together, as they had done, and there is\r\ncause for believing that they were never good friends again. But after the\r\nearly death of Giorgione, Titian completed the works he had left\r\nunfinished, and, no doubt, sincerely mourned for him.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated pictures by Titian is the Presentation in the\r\nTemple, which was painted for the Church of the Brotherhood of Charity,\r\ncalled in Italian \"La Scuola della Carità;\" this church is now the Academy\r\nof Fine Arts in Venice, where the picture still remains. It represents the\r\nVirgin Mary when three years old entering the temple and the high priest\r\nreceiving her at the entrance. All around below the steps is a company of\r\nfriends who have been invited by her father and mother to attend them on\r\nthis important occasion. The picture is full of life and action, and is\r\ngorgeous in its coloring. Several of the figures are said to be\r\nportraits, one being that of Titian himself.\r\n\r\nAmong his female portraits, that of Caterina Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus, is\r\ncelebrated; also one called \"Flora;\" both of these are in the Uffizi\r\nGallery, in Florence, while near by, in the Pitti, is \"La Bella,\" or the\r\nbeautiful lady of Titian. He also made many portraits of his daughter\r\nLavinia, who was very beautiful; sometimes he represented her as a fruit\r\nor flower-girl, again as Herodias and in various characters (Fig. 46). One\r\nof the finest of these is at Berlin, where she is in a very rich dress,\r\nand holds up a plate of fruit; it is one of his best works.\r\n\r\nTitian's fame extended throughout Italy, and even all over Europe, and the\r\nDuke of Ferrara invited him to his court. The artist went, and there\r\npainted two very famous mythological pictures, besides portraits and other\r\nworks. One of these important subjects was \"Bacchus and Ariadne,\" and it\r\nis now in the National Gallery, London; the second was a Venus, surrounded\r\nby more than sixty children and cupids; some are climbing trees, others\r\nshoot arrows in the air, while still others twine their arms around each\r\nother; this is now in Madrid.\r\n\r\nWhile at Ferrara the Pope, Leo X., asked Titian to go to Rome; but he\r\nlonged for his home--he wished for his yearly visit to Cadore, and he\r\ndeclined the honorable invitation, and returned to Venice. In 1530\r\nTitian's wife died, leaving him with two sons, Pomponio and Orazio, and\r\nhis daughter, Lavinia. In this same sad year the Emperor Charles V. and\r\nPope Clement VII. met at Bologna. All the most brilliant men of Germany\r\nand Italy were also there, and Titian was summoned to paint portraits of\r\nthe two great heads of Church and State, and of many of the notable men\r\namong their followers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--PORTRAIT OF LAVINIA. _By Titian._]\r\n\r\nWhen the painter returned to Venice he was loaded with honors and riches.\r\nHe bought a new house at Berigrande, opposite the island of Murano; it\r\ncommanded fine views and its garden was beautiful. The landscapes of his\r\npictures soon grew better than they had been, and no wonder, when he could\r\nalways see the Friuli Alps in the distance with their snow-capped peaks\r\nrising to the clouds; nearer him was the Murano, like another city with\r\nits towers and domes, and then the canals, which at night were gay with\r\nlighted gondolas bearing fair ladies hither and thither. Here Titian\r\nentertained many people, and some of them were exalted in station. The\r\nhouse was called \"Casa Grande,\" and on one occasion, when a cardinal and\r\nothers invited themselves to dine with him, Titian flung a purse to his\r\nsteward, saying, \"Now prepare a feast, since all the world dines with me.\"\r\n\r\nWhile living at \"Casa Grande,\" the artist saw the most glorious years of\r\nhis life. It seemed that every person of note in all Europe, both men and\r\nwomen, desired their portraits at his hand. One only, Cosmo I., Grand Duke\r\nof Florence, refused to sit to him. If these pictures could be collected\r\ntogether, most of the famous persons of his time would be represented in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter he was sixty years old Titian made a second journey to Ferrara,\r\nUrbino, and Bologna. This time he painted a portrait of Charles V., with a\r\nfavorite dog by his side. After this, in 1545, at an invitation from Pope\r\nPaul III., the great master went to Rome; while there he painted many\r\nwonderful pictures--among them, one of the pope with his two grandsons was\r\nvery remarkable; it is now in the Museum of Naples. He left Rome when he\r\nwas sixty-nine years old.\r\n\r\nIn 1548 Charles V. summoned Titian to Augsburg, and while there made him a\r\ncount, and gave him a yearly pension of two hundred gold ducats. The\r\nemperor was very fond of Titian, and spent a good deal of time with him.\r\nOn one occasion the painter dropped his brush; the emperor picked it up,\r\nand returned it to him. The etiquette of courts forbade any one to receive\r\nsuch a service from the sovereign, and Titian was much embarrassed, when\r\nCharles said, \"Titian is worthy to be served by Cæsar,\" this being one of\r\nthe great ruler's titles. Charles continued his favors to Titian through\r\nlife, and when he resigned his crown, and retired to the monastery of\r\nYuste, he took nine pictures by this master into his solitude. One of\r\nthese, a portrait of the Empress Isabella, was so hung that the emperor\r\ngazed upon it when dying; this is now in the museum at Madrid, where are\r\nalso many fine works by Titian, for Philip II. was his patron as his\r\nfather had been.\r\n\r\nWhen eighty-five years old he finished his wonderful picture of the\r\n\"Martyrdom of St. Lawrence\" for the Church of the Jesuits in Venice, and\r\nhis old age was one of strength and mental clearness. Though he had seen\r\ngreat prosperity and received many honors, he had not escaped sorrow.\r\nAfter the death of his wife, his sister Orsa, who was very dear to him,\r\nhad kept his house; she too sickened and died; his son Pomponio was a\r\nworthless fellow, and caused him much grief; Lavinia had married, and the\r\nold man was left with Orazio alone, who was a dutiful son. He also was an\r\nartist, but painted so frequently on the same canvas with his father that\r\nhis works cannot be spoken of separately.\r\n\r\nAt length Titian's work began to show his years, and some one told him\r\nthat his \"Annunciation\" did not resemble his usual pictures. He was very\r\nangry, and, seizing a pencil, wrote upon it, \"_Tizianus fecit\r\nfecit_\"--meaning to say by this, \"Truly, Titian did this!\" When he was\r\nninety-six years old he was visited by Henry III. of France, attended by a\r\ntrain of princes and nobles. The aged painter appeared with such grace and\r\ndignity as to excite the admiration of all, and when the king asked the\r\nprice of some pictures, Titian presented them to him as one sovereign\r\nmight make a gift to another who was his equal, and no more.\r\n\r\nIn 1576 the plague broke out in Venice, and both Titian and Orazio fell\r\nvictims to it. Naturally the man of ninety-eight years could not recover,\r\nand, though Orazio was borne off to the hospital and cared for as well as\r\npossible, he also died. After Titian was left alone robbers entered his\r\nhouse while he still lived, and carried away jewels, money, and pictures.\r\nHe died August 27th, and all Venice mourned for him.\r\n\r\nThere was a law that no person who died of the plague in Venice should be\r\nburied within the city; but Titian was so much honored and beloved that\r\nexception was made, and he was buried in the Church of Santa Maria\r\nGloriosa de Frari; or as it is usually called, \"the Frari.\" He had painted\r\na great picture of the Assumption for this church, which has since been\r\nremoved to the Academy of Venice; but another work of his, called the\r\nPesaro altar-piece, still remains near his grave. His burial-place is\r\nmarked by a simple tablet, inscribed thus: \"Here lies the great Tiziano di\r\nVecelli, rival of Zeuxis and Apelles.\"\r\n\r\nA little more than two centuries after his death the citizens of Venice\r\ndetermined to erect a monument to Titian, and Canova made a design for it;\r\nbut political troubles interfered, and prevented the execution of the\r\nplan. In 1852 the Emperor of Austria, Ferdinand I., placed a costly\r\nmonument near his grave; it consists of a Corinthian canopy beneath which\r\nis a sitting statue of the painter, while several other allegorical\r\nfigures are added to increase its magnificence. This monument was\r\ndedicated with imposing ceremonies, and it is curious to note that not far\r\naway from it the sculptor Canova is buried, and his own monument is made\r\nfrom the design which he made for that of Titian.\r\n\r\nSome writers consider the \"Entombment of Christ,\" in the Manfrini Palace,\r\nas the greatest work of Titian. At all events, it is the best existing\r\nrepresentation of this subject, and is a picture which has had a great\r\neffect upon art; its chief feature is the general expression of sorrow\r\nwhich pervades the whole work.\r\n\r\nTitian gave a new importance to landscape-painting by making backgrounds\r\nto his pictures from natural scenery, and that not as if it was merely for\r\nthe sake of a background, but in a manner which showed his love for\r\nNature, and, in fact, he often rendered it with poetical significance.\r\n\r\nThe works of Titian are very seldom sold. One subject which he oftentimes\r\nrepeated was that of \"Danäe\" with the shower of gold falling about her;\r\none of these was purchased by the Emperor of Russia for six hundred\r\nthousand francs. One of the most important of his religious pictures was\r\nthat of \"St. Peter Martyr;\" this was burned in the Church of SS. Giovanni\r\ne Paolo in Venice in 1868. An excellent copy of it had been for a long\r\ntime in the Museum of Florence, and this was presented to the Venetians in\r\norder to repair their loss as far as possible. Victor Amadeus of Sardinia\r\npresented nine pictures by Titian to the Duke of Marlborough, and these\r\nwere all destroyed in 1861 when the château of Blenheim was burned. Kugler\r\nsays: \"In the multifariousness of his powers Titian takes precedence of\r\nall other painters of his school; indeed, there is scarcely a line of art\r\nwhich in his long and very active life he did not enrich.\" His last work\r\nwas not quite completed by himself, and is now in the Academy of Venice.\r\nIt is a Pietà, and although the hand of ninety-eight years guided the\r\nbrush uncertainly, yet it has the wonderful light this master threw around\r\nhis figures, and the whole is conceived with his accustomed animation.\r\n\r\nThe pupils and followers of Titian were too numerous to be spoken of one\r\nby one, and none of them were so great as to require their mention in\r\ndetail here; yet they were so good that, while the other schools of Italy\r\nwere decreasing in importance during the sixteenth century, that of\r\nVenice was flourishing, and some great masters still existed there. Among\r\nthese was JACOPO ROBUSTI (1512-1594), who was called, and is best known as\r\nTintoretto, which name was given him because his father was a dyer. He\r\nstudied under Titian for a time, and then he attempted to follow Michael\r\nAngelo, and it is said that his motto was, \"The coloring of Titian, the\r\ndrawing of Michael Angelo.\" His best pictures are slightly treated, and\r\nothers are coarse and unfinished in the manner of painting. His portraits\r\nseem to be his best works, probably because they are more carefully\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nSeveral works of his are simply enormous; one is seventy-four by thirty\r\nfeet; the school of St. Roch has fifty-seven large pictures by him, in\r\nmany of which the figures are of life size. His two most famous works are\r\nthe \"Miracle of St. Mark,\" in the Academy of Venice, and the\r\n\"Crucifixion,\" in the school of St. Roch. The last is, for every reason,\r\nhis best work; there are crowds of people in it, on foot and on horseback,\r\nwhile their faces show every possible kind of expression, and their\r\nmovements are infinitely varied. The immense painting mentioned above is\r\nin the Doge's Palace, and is called \"Paradise.\" His daughter, MARIETTA\r\nROBUSTI (1560-1590), was a pupil of her father's, and became so good a\r\nportrait-painter that she was invited to the Court of Spain by Philip II.,\r\nbut her father could not consent to a separation from her. Some excellent\r\npictures of hers still exist, and her portraits of Marco dei Vescovi and\r\nthe antiquarian Strada were celebrated pictures. When the Emperor\r\nMaximilian and the Archduke Ferdinand, each in turn, desired her presence\r\nat their courts, her father hastened to marry her to Mario Augusti, a\r\nwealthy German jeweller, upon the condition that she should remain in her\r\nfather's house. She was celebrated for her beauty, had fine musical\r\ntalents, and was sprightly and enthusiastic; her father was so fond of\r\nhaving her with him that he sometimes allowed her to dress as a boy, and\r\ngo with him to study where young girls were not admitted.\r\n\r\nWhen but thirty years old Marietta Robusti died; she was buried in the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria dell Orto, where are several works by her father.\r\nBoth he and her husband mourned for her all their remaining days. Many\r\npictures of Tintoretto painting his daughter's portrait after her death\r\nhave been made by later artists.\r\n\r\nPAOLI CAGLIARI, or CALIARI, called PAUL VERONESE (1528-1588), was born at\r\nVerona, but as he lived mostly at Venice, he belongs to the school of that\r\ncity. He was an imitator of Titian, whom he did not equal; still he was a\r\nfine painter. His excellences were in his harmonious color, his good\r\narrangement of his figures in the foreground, and his fine architectural\r\nbackgrounds. He tried to make his works magnificent, and to do this he\r\npainted festive scenes, with many figures in splendid costumes. He is\r\nburied in the Church of St. Sebastian, where there are many of his works.\r\n\r\nIn the gallery of the Louvre is his \"Marriage at Cana.\" It is thirty by\r\ntwenty feet in size, and many of its figures are portraits. His pictures\r\nare numerous and are seen in the European galleries. The \"Family of\r\nDarius,\" in the National Gallery, London, cost that institution the\r\nenormous sum of thirteen thousand six hundred and fifty pounds; it was\r\nformerly in the Pisani Palace, Venice, and was said to have been left\r\nthere by Veronese as payment for his entertainment during a visit he had\r\nmade in the palace. In 1868, at the Demidoff sale, a portrait of his\r\ndaughter sold for two thousand five hundred and twenty-four pounds.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the sixteenth century a family of a father and four sons\r\nwere busy painting what may rightfully be termed the earliest _genre_\r\npictures of Italy. This term is used to denote pictures that stand\r\nbetween historical and utterly imaginary subjects; that is to say, the\r\nrepresentation of something that seems real to us because it is so\r\nfamiliar to our imagination, or because it is something that we know might\r\nhave happened, that it has all the naturalness of an actual reproduction\r\nof a fact. There may be interior or landscape _genre_ pictures. The first\r\nrepresent familiar in-door scenes--the latter are landscapes with animals\r\nor figures to give a life element and to tell a story.\r\n\r\nThe name of the family of which I speak was Da Ponte, but it was called\r\nBassano, from the birth-place of JACOPO DA PONTE BASSANO (1510-1592), the\r\nfather, who was the most important of the family. He studied in Venice,\r\nbut returned to his native town. His portraits are fine; among them are\r\nthose of the Doge of Venice, Ariosto, and Tasso. His works are very\r\nnumerous and are seen in all galleries. He introduced landscapes and\r\nanimals into most of his pictures, sometimes with great impropriety.\r\n\r\nWe come now to ANTONIO ALLEGRI, called CORREGGIO (1493-1534), who was born\r\nat the end of the fifteenth, but did his work in the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century. His name of Correggio is that of his birth-place, and\r\nas he was not born at any of the great art centres, and did not adopt the\r\nprecise manner of any school, he, with his followers, stand by themselves,\r\nand yet, because his principal works were done at Parma, he is sometimes\r\nsaid to be of the school of Parma.\r\n\r\nWhen Correggio was thirteen years old he had learned to draw well. He\r\nstudied under Andrea Mantegna and his son Francesco Mantegna. From these\r\nmasters he learned to be very skilful in drawing, especially in\r\nforeshortening, or in representing objects seen aslant. But though he\r\nlearned much of the science of art from his teachers, his grace and\r\nmovement and his exquisite light and shade are all his own, for they did\r\nnot possess these qualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--PORTRAIT OF CORREGGIO.]\r\n\r\nForeshortening is so important that I must try to explain it; and, as\r\nCorreggio is said to be the greatest master in this art since the days of\r\nthe Greeks, it is quite proper for me to speak of it in connection with\r\nhim. The art of foreshortening is that which makes different objects\r\npainted on a plane or flat surface appear as if they were at different\r\ndistances from the eye of the person who is looking at the picture, or as\r\nscenes in nature appear, where one part is much farther off than another.\r\nTo produce this effect it is often necessary to make an object--let us\r\nsay, for example, an arm or a leg, look as if it was stretched forward,\r\nout of the canvas, directly toward the person who is looking at it. Now,\r\nthe truth is that in order to produce this effect the object is often\r\nthrown backward in the drawing; sometimes also it is doubled up in an\r\nunnatural manner, and occupies a small space on the canvas, while it\r\nappears to be of life size when one looks at it. A \"Christ in Glory\"\r\npainted by Correggio in the cupola of the Church of San Giovanni\r\nEvangelista, in Parma, is a fine piece of foreshortening. The head is so\r\nthrown back, and the knees are so thrown forward, that the whole figure\r\nseems to be of life size; yet if the space from the top of the head to the\r\nsoles of the feet were measured, it would be found to be much less than\r\nthe height of the same figure would be if it were drawn in an erect\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nI have already explained the meaning of chiaro-scuro, and this delicate\r\nmanner of passing from light to shade was another quality in the works of\r\nCorreggio. It is even seen in his early works, as, for instance, in the\r\nbeautiful Madonna di San Francesco, now at Dresden, which he painted when\r\nhe was but eighteen years old.\r\n\r\nWhen this master was twenty-six years old he married Girolama Nurlini, and\r\nabout the same time he was summoned to Mantua by the Duke Federigo\r\nGonzaga. During eleven years after his marriage he was occupied with works\r\nin Mantua, and with his great frescoes at Parma. In 1530 he returned to\r\nCorreggio, and there passed the remainder of his life. That he held a high\r\nposition is proved by certain records of his life, among which is the fact\r\nthat in 1533 he was invited to be one of the witnesses of the marriage of\r\nthe Lord of Correggio.\r\n\r\nIt is said that when this painter saw one of the great works of Raphael,\r\nhe exclaimed, enthusiastically and thankfully, \"I, too, am a painter!\" and\r\nno doubt he then felt himself moved to attempt such works as should make\r\nhis name known to all the world through future centuries. When Titian saw\r\nCorreggio's frescoes at Parma, he said: \"Were I not Titian, I should wish\r\nto be Correggio.\" Annibale Caracci, also a great artist, said of\r\nCorreggio, more than a hundred years after his death, \"He was the only\r\npainter!\" and declared that the children he painted seemed to breathe and\r\nsmile with such grace that one was forced to smile and be happy with them.\r\n\r\nIn 1534 Correggio died of a fever, and was buried in his family tomb in\r\nthe Franciscan Convent of his native city. His grave is simply marked with\r\nhis name and the date of his death.\r\n\r\nSome of his oil-paintings are very famous. One at Dresden, representing\r\nthe \"Nativity of the Saviour,\" is called the \"Notte,\" or night, because\r\nthe only light on the picture comes from the halo of glory around the head\r\nof the Holy Child. Correggio's \"Reading Magdalen\" is in the same gallery;\r\nprobably no one picture exists which has been more universally admired\r\nthan this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--UPPER PART OF A FRESCO BY CORREGGIO.]\r\n\r\nThere was a large work of his representing \"The Shepherds Adoring the\r\nInfant Saviour,\" at Seville, in Spain. During the Peninsular War (1808-14)\r\nthe people of that city sent many valuable things to Cadiz for safety, and\r\nthis picture, on account of its size, was cut in two. By some accident\r\nthe two parts were separated; but both were sold, and the purchaser of\r\neach was promised that the other portion should be given him. From this\r\nmuch trouble arose, because both purchasers determined to keep what they\r\nhad, and each claimed that the whole belonged to him, and as they were\r\nequally obstinate, the two parts of the same work have never been\r\nreunited. Fortunately, each half makes a picture by itself.\r\n\r\nThe frescoes at Parma are the greatest works of this master, and it is\r\nvery interesting to visit that quaint old city; his works are in the\r\nCathedral, the Church of St. John the Evangelist, and in the parlor of the\r\nConvent of the Benedictine Nuns. This last is a wonderful room. The\r\nceiling is arched and high, and painted to represent an arbor of vines\r\nwith sixteen oval openings, out of which frolicsome children are peeping,\r\nas if, in passing around behind the vines, they had stopped to look down\r\ninto the room. The pictures here will make you understand the effect\r\n(Figs. 48 and 49). Beneath each of these openings or lunettes is a\r\nhalf-circular picture of some mythological story or personage. Upon the\r\nwall of the parlor, above the mantel, there is a picture of Diana, the\r\ngoddess of the moon and the protector of young animals, which is a\r\nbeautiful picture.\r\n\r\nWhen Correggio worked on the frescoes at the Church of St. John, he lived\r\nmuch in the monastery connected with it. The monks became very fond of\r\nhim, and made him a member of the Congregation Cassinensi; the poet Tasso\r\nalso was a member of this fraternity. This membership gave him the right\r\nto share in the masses, prayers, and alms of the community, and after his\r\ndeath the same offices for the repose of his soul would be performed as if\r\nhe had been a true monk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--LOWER PART OF A FRESCO BY CORREGGIO.]\r\n\r\nThe works of Correggio are very rarely sold. The madonna in the National\r\nGallery, London, known as \"_La Vierge au Panier_,\" was formerly in the\r\nRoyal Gallery at Madrid. During the French invasion of Spain, Mr. Wallace,\r\nan English artist, obtained it. It is painted on a panel, and is 13½\r\ninches high by 10 inches wide. In 1813 it was offered for sale in London\r\nat twelve hundred pounds. In 1825 it was sold in Paris for eighty thousand\r\nfrancs, and soon after sold to the National Gallery for thirty-eight\r\nhundred pounds, or nearly nineteen thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nA copy of the \"Reading Magdalen\" was sold to Earl Dudley for sixteen\r\nhundred pounds, or more than seven thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nCorreggio had but few pupils, but he had many imitators. The one most\r\nworthy of mention was FRANCESCO MAZZUOLI (1503-1540), called IL\r\nPARMIGIANO, or PARMIGIANINO. He was not a great painter. The \"Vision of\r\nSt. Jerome,\" in the National Gallery, London, is one of his best works. It\r\nis said that during the sack of Rome, in 1527, he was painting the figures\r\nof the Virgin and Child in this picture, and was so engrossed by his work\r\nthat the invaders entered his studio, and surrounded him before he was\r\naware of their approach. And they, for their part, were so moved by what\r\nthey saw that they went away, and left him undisturbed.\r\n\r\nArt writers often use the term \"early masters.\" This denotes Michael\r\nAngelo, Raphael, and other men so great that they were very prominent in\r\nthe history of art, and were imitated by so many followers that they had\r\nan unusual effect upon the world. Titian may be called the last of these\r\ngreat masters of the early school, and his life was so long that he lived\r\nto see a great decline in art.\r\n\r\nThe painters of the close of the sixteenth century are called\r\n\"Mannerists,\" which means that they adopted or imitated the manner or\r\nstyle of some great master who had preceded them--and this was done in so\r\ncold and spiritless a way that it may be said that true artistic\r\ninspiration was dead in Italy. No one lived who, out of his own\r\nimagination, could fix upon the wall or the canvas such scenes as would\r\nbefit a poet's dream or serve to arouse the enthusiasm of those who saw\r\nthe painted story born in the artist's brain.\r\n\r\nAbout 1600, the beginning of the seventeenth century, there arose a new\r\nmovement in Italian art, which resulted in forming two schools between\r\nwhich there came to be much bitterness of feeling, and even deadly hatred.\r\nOn one side there were those who wished to continue the study and\r\nimitation of the works of the old masters, but with this they united a\r\nstudy of nature. These men were called \"Eclectics,\" because they elected\r\nor chose certain parts of different systems of painting, and from these\r\nformed a new manner of their own.\r\n\r\nOpposed to the Eclectics were the \"Naturalists,\" who insisted that nature\r\nonly should be studied, and that everything should be represented in the\r\nmost realistic way, and made to appear in the picture exactly as it did in\r\nreality, not being beautified or adorned by any play of fancy or\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nThe chief school of the Eclectics, of whom I will first speak, was at\r\nBologna, and is known also as the \"school of the Caracci,\" because\r\nLUDOVICO CARACCI (1555-1619) was at the head of a large academy there, and\r\nwas assisted by his nephews, AGOSTINO CARACCI (1558-1601) and ANNIBALE\r\nCARACCI (1560-1609), the latter being the greatest artist of the three.\r\nThe lives of the Caracci are not of such interest as to require an account\r\nof them here, neither are their works so interesting that we may not leave\r\nthese artists by saying that they have great consideration as the heads of\r\nthe Eclectic Academy, and for the work they did in it at an important era\r\nin the history of Italian art; but the fruits of their work are shown in\r\nthat of their scholars rather than in their own paintings, and in this\r\nview their influence can scarcely be overvalued.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of their scholars was DOMENICO ZAMPIERI (1581-1641), called\r\nDOMENICHINO, who was born at Bologna, and was instructed by Denis Calvert,\r\nwho forbade his drawing after the works of Annibale Caracci. Domenico\r\ndisobeyed this command, and was so severely treated by Calvert that he\r\npersuaded his father to take him from that master, and place him in the\r\nschool of the Caracci. When he entered the Academy he was so dull that his\r\nfellow-pupils nicknamed him \"The Ox;\" but Annibale Caracci said: \"Take\r\ncare: this ox will surpass you all by and by, and will be an honor to his\r\nart.\" Domenichino soon began to win many prizes in the school, and left it\r\nwell trained and prepared for a brilliant career.\r\n\r\nHe gave much thought to his art, shunned private society, and if he went\r\nout at all he frequented public places where large numbers of people were\r\ngathered, thus affording him an opportunity to study their varying\r\nexpressions. He also tried to feel in himself the emotions of the person\r\nhe was painting. For instance, it is said that when he was painting the\r\n\"Scourging of St. Andrew,\" he threw himself into a passion, and used\r\nthreatening gestures and high words. In the midst of this his master,\r\nAnnibale Caracci, surprised him, and was so impressed with his method that\r\nhe threw his arms about his pupil's neck, exclaiming, \"To-day, my\r\nDomenichino, thou art teaching me!\"\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated work by Domenichino is the \"Communion of St. Jerome,\"\r\nin the Vatican. It is universally considered the second picture in Rome,\r\nthe \"Transfiguration,\" by Raphael, being the only one that is placed\r\nbefore it. The scene it represents is just before the death of the saint,\r\nwhen he was borne into the chapel to receive the sacrament of the\r\ncommunion for the last time (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--COMMUNION OF ST. JEROME.]\r\n\r\nDomenichino was made very unhappy in Rome, on account of the jealousy of\r\nother artists, and he returned to Bologna. However, his fame had reached\r\nthe court at Naples, and the viceroy of that city invited the artist to\r\ndecorate the Chapel of St. Januarius. There was in Naples at that time an\r\nassociation of artists who had determined that no strange artist should be\r\nallowed to do work of any account in their city. As soon as Domenichino\r\nbegan his work, therefore, he received letters threatening his life. His\r\ncolors were spoiled by having ruinous chemicals mixed with them, his\r\nsketches were stolen from his studio, and all sorts of insults and\r\nindignities were heaped upon him.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, the painter was so disheartened that he fled to Rome; but\r\nthe viceroy sent for him and took every precaution possible to protect him\r\nand enable him to work in peace. But just as all seemed to be going well\r\nhe sickened and died, and it has always been said that he was poisoned. Be\r\nthis as it may, there is no doubt that the fear, vexation, and anxiety of\r\nhis life caused his death, and on this account his tormentors were his\r\nmurderers.\r\n\r\nThe works of Domenichino are not numerous, and are not seen in as many\r\ngalleries as are those of some Italian painters; but there are a\r\nconsiderable number scattered over Europe and very beautiful ones in\r\nseveral galleries in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe next painter of importance in the Eclectic school was GUIDO RENI\r\n(1575-1642), born at Bologna, and the son of a professor of music. His\r\nfather intended that Guido also should be a musician, and the poor boy was\r\nmuch persecuted on account of his love for drawing. But after many\r\nstruggles the boy came into the Caracci school, and was soon a favorite\r\npupil there.\r\n\r\nWhen still young he listened with great attention to a lecture from\r\nAnnibale, in which he laid down the rules which should govern a true\r\npainter. Guido resolved to follow these rules closely, and soon he painted\r\nso well that he was accused of trying to establish a new system of\r\npainting. At last Ludovico Caracci turned against him and dismissed him\r\nfrom his school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--AURORA. _By Guido Reni._]\r\n\r\nThe young artist went to Rome; but his persecutions did not cease, and it\r\nseemed to be his fate to excite the jealousy of other painters. Now, when\r\nso much time has elapsed, we know that Guido was not a very great master,\r\nand had he painted in the days of Michael Angelo he would not have been\r\nthought so. But art had lowered its standard, and Guido's works were\r\nsuited to the taste of his time; he had a high conception of beauty, and\r\nhe tried to reach it in his pictures.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his career Guido really painted in three styles. His\r\nearliest pictures are the strongest; those of his middle period are\r\nweaker, because he seemed only to strive to represent grace and sweetness;\r\nhis latest pictures are careless and unequal in execution, for he grew\r\nindifferent to fame, and became so fond of gaming that he only painted in\r\norder to get money to spend in this sinful folly.\r\n\r\nHis masterpiece in Rome was the \"Aurora,\" on a ceiling of the Rospigliosi\r\nPalace; it represents the goddess of the dawn as floating before the\r\nchariot of Apollo, or Phoebus, the god of the sun. She scatters flowers\r\nupon the earth, he holds the reins over four piebald and white horses,\r\nwhile Cupid, with his lighted torch, floats just above them. Around the\r\nchariot dance seven graceful female figures which represent the Hours, or\r\nHoræ. I have been asked why seven was the number; the ancients had no\r\nfixed number for the Hours; sometimes they were spoken of as two, again\r\nthree, and even in some cases as ten. It has always seemed to me that ten\r\nwas the number chosen by Guido, for in that case there would naturally be\r\nthree out of sight, on the side of the chariot which is not seen (Fig.\r\n51).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--BEATRICE CENCI.]\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Beatrice Cenci is another very celebrated picture by\r\nGuido; it is in the gallery of the Barberini Palace, in Rome (Fig. 52).\r\nThe interest in the portrait of this unhappy girl is world-wide. She was\r\nthe daughter of a wealthy Roman noble, who after the death of her mother\r\nmarried a second time, and treated the children of his first marriage in a\r\nbrutal way. It is even said that he hired assassins to murder two of his\r\nsons on their return from a journey to Spain. The story also relates that\r\nhis cruelty to Beatrice was such that, with the aid of her step-mother and\r\nher brother, she killed him. At all events, these three were accused of\r\nthis crime and were executed for it in 1599. Other accounts say that he\r\nwas murdered by robbers, and his wife and children were made to appear as\r\nif guilty. Clement VII. was the pope at that time, and in spite of his\r\nknowledge of the cruelty of the father he would not pardon them, though\r\nmercy was implored of him for this lovely girl. The reason given for this\r\naction of the pope's is that he wished to confiscate the Cenci estates,\r\nwhich he could do if the family suffered the death penalty. So many\r\nreproductions of this sad face have been made that it is very familiar to\r\nus, and almost seems to have been the face of some one whom we have known.\r\n\r\nGuido did not paint his St. Michael for the Cappucini in Rome until after\r\nhe returned to his native city. When he sent the picture to the monks, he\r\nwrote: \"I wish I had the wings of an angel to have ascended into Paradise,\r\nand there to have beholden the forms of those beautified spirits from\r\nwhich I might have copied my archangel; but not being able to mount so\r\nhigh, it was in vain for me to search for his resemblance here below, so\r\nthat I was forced to make an introspection into my own mind, and into that\r\nidea of beauty which I have formed in my own imagination.\"\r\n\r\nWe are told that he always tried to paint his ideal of beauty rather than\r\nto reproduce any human beauty that he had seen. He would pose his\r\ncolor-grinder, and draw his outlines from him, and then fill in with his\r\nown conceptions of what the head he was painting should be; this accounts\r\nfor the sameness in his heads and faces.\r\n\r\nHis passion for gaming degraded the close of his life. It led him into\r\ngreat distresses, and for the sake of money he painted many pictures which\r\nare not worthy of his name. He had always received generous prices for his\r\npictures, but he left many debts as a blot upon his memory. His works are\r\nseen in the galleries of Europe, and are always admired for their feeling,\r\nbeauty, and grace.\r\n\r\nFRANCESCO ALBANI (1578-1660), born at Bologna, was another scholar of the\r\nCaracci school, and a friend of Guido Reni. There are many works of his in\r\nRome. His pictures of landscapes with figures were his best works, and\r\nbeauty was his characteristic. His own home had all the advantages for\r\npainting such works as he best succeeded in, such as Venus and the Loves,\r\nmaids and boys, children and Cupids in unending variety.\r\n\r\nHis villa was surrounded by charming views. His wife was very handsome,\r\nand they had twelve lovely children, so lovely that it is said that other\r\nartists besides himself made use of them for models.\r\n\r\nThere were several other Eclectics of some importance of whom we shall not\r\nspeak, but shall leave them with an account of ELISABETTA SIRANI\r\n(1640-1665), who also was born at Bologna, and is worthy of attention on\r\naccount of her talents, while the story of her life adds another interest\r\nthan that which she has as an artist.\r\n\r\nShe was an imitator of the attractive manner of Guido Reni. The heads of\r\nher madonnas and magdalens are charming, and, indeed, all her work speaks\r\nof the innate refinement of her nature. Her industry was marvellous, since\r\nshe made one hundred and fifty pictures and etchings in a period of about\r\nten years. Much has been said of the rapidity with which she worked, and\r\none story relates that on a certain day the Duchess of Brunswick, the\r\nDuchess of Mirandola, and the Duke Cosimo de Medici, with other persons,\r\nmet in her studio, and she sketched and shaded drawings of subjects which\r\nthey named to her, with a skill and celerity which astonished and\r\ndelighted her guests.\r\n\r\nHer masterpiece is a picture of \"St. Anthony Adoring the Virgin and\r\nChild,\" which is in the Pinacoteca of Bologna. There are pictures by her\r\nin the Belvedere and Lichtenstein Galleries at Vienna, in the Hermitage at\r\nSt. Petersburg, and in the Sciarra Palace, Rome.\r\n\r\nIn person Elisabetta Sirani was beautiful, and her character commanded the\r\naffection of all who knew her. She was a sweet singer, and her biographers\r\nincrease her virtues by praising her taste in dress, and even her\r\nmoderation in eating! She was skilful in domestic affairs, and was in the\r\nhabit of rising early to perform her share in the household duties, never\r\nallowing her art to displace any occupation which properly made a part of\r\nher life. Her name has come down through more than two centuries as one\r\nwhose \"devoted filial affection, feminine grace, and artless benignity of\r\nmanner added a lustre to her great talents, and completed a personality\r\nwhich her friends regarded as an ideal of perfection.\"\r\n\r\nShe died very suddenly, and the cause of her death has never been known;\r\nbut the theory that she was poisoned has been generally accepted. Several\r\nreasons for the crime have been given; one is that she was the victim of\r\njealous artists, as Domenichino had been; another, that a princely lover\r\nwhom she had scorned thus revenged himself. A servant-girl in her family\r\nwas suspected of the crime, tried, and banished; but after a time she was\r\nrecalled to Bologna at the request of the father of Elisabetta, for he saw\r\nno proof of the girl's guilt. Thus the mystery was never solved, but the\r\nwhole city of Bologna was saddened by her death. The day of her burial was\r\none of public mourning; her funeral was attended with great pomp, and she\r\nwas buried beside Guido Reni in the splendid church of the Dominicans.\r\nPoems and orations in her praise were numerous, and a book was published,\r\ncalled \"Il Penello Lagrimate,\" which contained these, with odes, anagrams,\r\nand epitaphs, in both Latin and Italian, all setting forth her charms and\r\nvirtues. Her portrait in the Ercolani Gallery at Bologna represents her\r\nwhen occupied in painting her father's portrait; according to this picture\r\nshe had a tall, elegant figure, and a very pretty face. She had two\r\nsisters, Barbara and Anna Maria, who also were artists, but her fame was\r\nso much greater than theirs that she quite overshadowed them.\r\n\r\nThe earliest master of the Naturalists was MICHAEL ANGELO AMERIGI, called\r\nCARAVAGGIO, from the name of his birth-place (1569-1609). His life and\r\ncharacter was not such as to make him an attractive study. His subjects\r\nand his manner of representing them combined in producing what has been\r\ncalled \"the poetry of the repulsive.\" He was wild in his nature and lived\r\na wild life. His religious subjects, even, were coarse, though his color\r\nwas vivid and his figures arranged with good effect. His \"False Players\"\r\nis one of his best works; it represents two men playing cards, while a\r\nthird looks over the shoulder of one as if advising him what to play.\r\n\r\nNaturally, his manner of painting was best suited to scenes from common\r\nlife, though he made those coarse and sometimes painful; but when he\r\nattempted subjects of a higher order his works are positively offensive.\r\nSome of his sacred pictures were removed from the altars for which they\r\nwere painted on account of their coarseness. His most celebrated work is\r\nthe \"Entombment of Christ,\" at the Vatican; in the Gallery of the Capitol\r\nin Rome there is a \"Fortune Teller,\" which is also a fine work.\r\n\r\nNext to Caravaggio came GIUSEPPE RIBERA, called IL SPAGNOLETTO\r\n(1588-1656). He was a native of Valencia, and when very young made his way\r\nto Rome, so that, although his education as an artist was wholly Italian,\r\nhis familiar name arose from his Spanish origin. While living in\r\nmiserable poverty in Rome, and industriously copying such frescoes as he\r\ncould gain access to, he attracted the attention of a cardinal, who took\r\nhim to his home, and made him comfortable. But the young painter soon ran\r\naway, and returned to his street life. The cardinal sought him out, and\r\ncalled him an \"ungrateful little Spaniard;\" but Ribera excused his conduct\r\nby saying that as soon as he was made comfortable and was well fed he lost\r\nall ambition to work, adding that it would require the spur of poverty to\r\nmake him a good painter. The cardinal respected his courage, and the story\r\nbeing repeated to other artists, much interest was attracted to him.\r\n\r\nLater he went to Naples, and joined the cabal there which had agreed to\r\npersecute the strange artists who should come to work in that city. If\r\nRibera did not actually commit many of the crimes which were done there,\r\nhe was responsible for them through his influence. His works are\r\nfrequently so brutal in their subjects and treatment that one feels that\r\nhe who painted them must have lost all the kindliness of his nature.\r\n\r\nHe married the daughter of a rich picture dealer, and became very rich\r\nhimself. In 1630 he was made a member of the Academy of St. Luke, at Rome,\r\nand in 1648 Pope Innocent X. sent him the cross of the Order of Christ.\r\nFew Italian artists were better known in their own country, and many of\r\nhis pictures were sent to Spain. His greatest excellence was in his\r\nknowledge of anatomy, and he painted subjects that enabled him to show\r\nthis. Among his famous works are a \"Descent from the Cross;\" \"The Flaying\r\nof St. Bartholomew;\" \"Ixion on the Wheel;\" and \"Cato of Utica.\" His works\r\nare in all the famous galleries of the world.\r\n\r\nRibera's greatest pupil was SALVATOR ROSA (1615-1673), the landscape\r\npainter, who was a very gifted man, being a poet and musician as well as\r\nan artist. His father was an educated man, and with his other relatives\r\nencouraged his son in his taste for art. When twenty years old he went to\r\nRome, and with the exception of some intervals remained there during his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt is said that as a youth he associated much with bandits, and, when one\r\nconsiders the wildness of many of his scenes and the character of the\r\nfigures in their midst, it is not difficult to believe that this may have\r\nbeen true. It is certain that he painted the portrait of the famous\r\nMasaniello more than once, and he is believed to have joined the\r\n_Compagnia della Morte_, of which Falcone, one of his masters, was the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nSalvator made many enemies by his independence and his inclination to\r\nsatire. He wrote satires on various subjects which were not published\r\nuntil after his death, but it was known that he had written them. He\r\nmarried a Florentine woman, who was the mother of his two sons. When he\r\ndied he was buried in the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, where a\r\nmonument is erected to his memory.\r\n\r\nHe painted some historical subjects and portraits in which he followed the\r\nNaturalists, but his principal works were landscapes. Jagged rocks and\r\nmountains, wild dells and lonely defiles, with here and there robbers,\r\nhermits, or soldiers, make his most effective pictures. There is a deep\r\nsense of desolation, almost of fear, in them which is very impressive.\r\nSometimes he painted serene landscapes and poetic figures; but his best\r\nworks are not of this sort. His pictures are in the principal public and\r\nin some private galleries. He also left about ninety etchings which are\r\nmasterly in execution and full of expression in the heads, while the\r\natmosphere is soft. When his works are sold they bring great prices. A\r\nlarge landscape with Apollo and the Sibyl in the foreground brought eight\r\nthousand five hundred dollars in England years ago, and is now worth much\r\nmore than that.\r\n\r\nEarly in the eighteenth century an artist named ANTONIO CANALE\r\n(1697-1768), called CANALETTO, began to make views of the city of Venice\r\nand scenes on the canals. He had two followers, BERNARDO BELLOTTI\r\n(1720-1780), who was his nephew, and FRANCESCO GUARDI (1712-1793), and\r\nthese three painters executed a large number of these pictures, which are\r\nfound in many European galleries, and it is not always easy to distinguish\r\ntheir authorship. There is no doubt that many which were once attributed\r\nto the first master were really painted by his pupils.\r\n\r\nBefore the commencement of the eighteenth century the decline of the\r\nRenaissance school in Italy had begun; in fact, the painting of the\r\nseventeenth century came to be mere mechanical realism. For this reason\r\nthe portraits were the best pictures of the time, as in them it was\r\nrequisite to be true to the object represented.\r\n\r\nLate in the eighteenth century a new impulse was given to Italian\r\npainting, chiefly through the influence of foreign artists such as Raphael\r\nMengs, and the French painter David. In the beginning of our own century\r\nLORENZO BENVENUTI (1769-1844) executed some excellent frescoes in\r\nFlorence, Siena, and Arezzo, which was his native city. He decorated the\r\nceiling of the Medici Chapel in the Church of San Lorenzo in Florence, and\r\nLeopold II., Grand Duke of Tuscany, erected a tomb to this painter in the\r\nsame church where he had spent so much time and talent. His portrait,\r\npainted by himself, is in the gallery of the Uffizi, at Florence.\r\nVINCENZIO CAMMUCCINI (1775-1844), too, was a celebrated master of his\r\ntime. He was a Roman by birth, and became President of the Academy of St.\r\nLuke; he was also a member of the Institute of France, and received\r\ndecorations from sovereigns of various countries. He made many copies from\r\nthe works of the great masters. His portraits were so much admired as to\r\nbe compared to those of Rubens and Tintoretto, and his ceiling frescoes\r\nin the Torlonia Palace, Rome, were among his important works, as was a\r\n\"Presentation of Christ in the Temple,\" painted for the Church of San\r\nGiovanni in Piacenza.\r\n\r\nBut there has been no true restoration of Italian art. The painting of\r\nItaly in our time has been largely a commercial enterprise rather than an\r\noutcome from artistic genius or impulse, and the few works which are\r\nexceptions to this rule are not sufficient to encourage the hope that this\r\nnation can again attain to her former rank or regain the fame of her past\r\nin the history of modern art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN FLANDERS, HOLLAND, AND GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlanders formerly embraced a larger part of Belgium than is contained in\r\nthe present Belgian provinces of East and West Flanders. It also covered a\r\nportion of Holland and some territory in the northwest of France. The\r\nprincipal Flemish towns connected with the story of Flemish art were\r\nBruges, Tournai, Louvain, Ghent, Antwerp, Brussels, Mechlin, Liege, and\r\nUtrecht.\r\n\r\nThere are some records of Flemish painting much earlier than the fifteenth\r\ncentury, but they are so vague and uncertain that I shall pass them over,\r\nand begin with the family of Van Eyck, in which there were four\r\npainters--three brothers and a sister. The eldest, HUBERT VAN EYCK\r\n(1366-1426), effected a great change in the art of his time and country.\r\nVery little is known of him as a young man, or indeed of his personal\r\nhistory at all, except that he passed his middle life at Bruges and his\r\nlater years at Ghent. The subjects of his pictures were mostly scriptural.\r\nI do not suppose that the pictures of this master would seem very\r\nbeautiful to you if you saw them, but they are of great value. His\r\ngreatest work was an altar-piece for Judocus Vyts and his wife Lisabetta;\r\nit was for the decoration of their funeral chapel in the Church of St.\r\nBavon in Ghent. It was an immense work, with a centre-piece and wings that\r\ncould be closed; the inside was divided into twelve different pictures,\r\nand the outside also was painted. We do not know how much of this was\r\ncompleted when Hubert died and left it to be finished by his brother John.\r\nPhilip I. of Spain wished to buy this altar-piece, and when he could not\r\ndo so, he employed Michael Coxie to copy it; this artist spent two years\r\non the work, and was paid four thousand florins. Of the original work, a\r\nlarge portion remains in the Church of St. Bavon; the wings, consisting of\r\nsix beautiful, tall panels, are in the Berlin Museum, and two outer\r\ncompartments are in the Brussels Museum. The picture of holy men who have\r\nserved God is on one of the wings of this altar-piece (Fig. 53).\r\n\r\nBut the principal interest attached to Hubert van Eyck comes from the fact\r\nthat he made such discoveries in the use of colors as led to what we call\r\nthe \"Invention of Oil-Painting,\" and this invention is always attributed\r\nto the Van Eycks, for it is probable that the discoveries of Hubert were\r\nperfected by JAN VAN EYCK (1390-1440), who became a celebrated painter.\r\nOil-painting had been known, it is true, a long time, but the manner of\r\npreparing the colors and the varnish used before the time of the Van Eycks\r\nwas very unsatisfactory, and the improvement of these substances was the\r\nwork of these masters.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of Hubert van Eyck are stronger than those of Jan, who was\r\nreally the founder of a school remarkable for delicacy and fine finish\r\nrather than for power. It was after the death of Hubert that the fame of\r\nthe new colors spread abroad, and thus it happened that it was to Jan that\r\nother artists went to learn his secrets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--THE ANCHORITES. _In S. Bavon at Ghent._]\r\n\r\nJan van Eyck was something of a diplomat as well as a painter, for when he\r\nwas in the service of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, he was sent on\r\nseveral secret missions, and in 1428 he accompanied the ambassadors of the\r\nduke to Portugal in order to paint the portrait of Isabella of Portugal,\r\nwho was betrothed to the duke. There is a goodly number of works by Jan\r\nvan Eyck in various galleries. The portrait of himself and wife in the\r\nNational Gallery, London, is very interesting; they stand hand in hand,\r\nwith a terrier dog at their feet; their dress and all the details of their\r\nsurroundings are painted with great care. It is said that the Princess\r\nMary, sister of Charles V., gave a barber who owned it a position with a\r\nhandsome salary in exchange for the picture. Jan van Eyck, being twenty\r\nyears younger than his brother Hubert, naturally learned all that the\r\nelder knew, and the story of his life gives him the appearance of being\r\nthe more important artist, though in point of highest merit he was not the\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\nOf LAMBERT VAN EYCK very little is known. It is believed that he made the\r\ncopy of Hubert's great work which is in the Antwerp Museum; another work\r\ncalled by his name is in Louvain. MARGARETHA VAN EYCK is said to have been\r\na skilful artist, but no one picture can be ascribed to her; she was\r\nburied beside her brother Hubert in the Cathedral of Ghent.\r\n\r\nOf course the Van Eycks had many followers. Among them were PETRUS\r\nCHRISTUS (records 1444-1471), GERARD VAN DER MEIRE (records 1447-1474),\r\nHUGO VON DER GOES (1405?-1482), and JUSTUS OF GHENT (1468-?), all of whom\r\nwere good artists, but I shall pass to a more important one, ROGIER VAN\r\nDER WEYDEN (1400-1464), who was himself the head of a school of as great\r\nimportance as was that of the Van Eycks. His realism was his chief\r\ncharacteristic, and this was so great as to make some of his works\r\nrepulsive, especially his martyrdoms, in which he detailed horrors with\r\ngreat exactness. He also loved to paint pictures which illustrated the\r\nmyths of the Middle Ages. Our illustration is from one of these works\r\n(Fig. 54).\r\n\r\nThis picture is from the story that when the Roman Senate decreed divine\r\nhonors to the Emperor Augustus, he consulted the Tiburtine Sibyl as to\r\nwhether he ought to receive them or no. She replied to him that it was\r\nmore becoming for him to go away silently, and told him that a Hebrew\r\nchild should be born who should reign over the gods themselves, or that a\r\nking should come from heaven whose power should never end. Another\r\nversion, which is the one this picture represents, says that the heavens\r\nopened, and a vision of the Virgin with the Saviour in her arms, standing\r\non an altar, was shown the emperor. He worshipped it, and heard a voice\r\nsaying, \"Haec ara filii Dei\" (This is the altar of the Son of God).\r\nAugustus reported this to the Senate, and erected an altar upon the spot\r\nin Rome where the Church of Santa Maria in Capitolio, or the \"Ara\r\nCoeli,\" now stands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--THE SIBYL AND THE EMPEROR AUGUSTUS. _By Rogier\r\nvan der Weyden. In the Berlin Museum._]\r\n\r\nMany pictures by Van der Weyden are seen in European galleries. He was\r\nalso a fine miniaturist. He was official painter to the city of Brussels,\r\nand was buried in its cathedral.\r\n\r\nHis son, ROGIER VAN DER WEYDEN the younger, became very rich and\r\nbenevolent. He died at Brussels in 1529. His works are not numerous in\r\npublic galleries.\r\n\r\nThe elder Van der Weyden had a pupil, HANS MEMLING (records 1450-1499),\r\nwho became the greatest master in Belgium. I shall not give you a long\r\naccount of him; but shall tell you of his greatest work, which was the\r\nShrine of St. Ursula, at the Hospital of Bruges, and is the best example\r\nof this type of early Flemish art which still exists. It is divided into\r\nsix compartments, with two ends, and other panels on top, all of which are\r\nfinished with the greatest care, and give the whole story of St. Ursula\r\nand her eleven thousand virgins, which is that Ursula was a daughter of a\r\nking of Brittany who was a Christian. The young girl was educated with the\r\ngreatest care, and the fame of her beauty and wisdom spread all over\r\nEurope. At length the king of England asked for her to be the wife of his\r\nson. The princess replied that she would wed him on three conditions:\r\nfirst, that he should give her ten virgins of noble blood for her\r\ncompanions, then to each of these virgins and to herself he should give a\r\nthousand maidens as attendants; second, he should allow her three years\r\nwith these companions, with whom she should visit the shrines where the\r\nbodies of the saints repose; and third, the English king and his court\r\nshould receive baptism.\r\n\r\nI cannot give space for all the details of this story, which is of great\r\ninterest; but the result was that Ursula received all that she asked, and\r\nstarted on her journey to Rome, in the course of which she and the eleven\r\nthousand maidens met with many adventures. At last, having reached Cologne\r\non their return, they encountered an army of barbarians which was\r\nbesieging the city, and all were slain.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the pictures as they were painted by Memling were: 1, the\r\nfirst landing at Cologne in the beginning of the journey; 2, the landing\r\nat Basle; 3, the arrival in Rome; 4, the second arrival at Basle on her\r\nreturn toward home; 5, commencement of the martyrdom, when Ursula and her\r\ntrain are first seen by the barbarians; 6, death of Ursula.\r\n\r\nThe works of Memling which still remain are numerous, and are seen in many\r\npublic galleries. After the death of this master the purity of Flemish\r\npainting declined. Many artists visited Italy, and the manner of Flemish\r\npainters was influenced by association with Italian art and artists. I\r\nshall, therefore, pass over a period when no very important masters\r\nappeared, and speak next of a great man, QUINTIN MATSYS (1466-1529), who\r\nbegan life as a blacksmith. He was born at Antwerp, and there are\r\nspecimens of iron work there said to have been executed by him. It is said\r\nthat he fell in love with the daughter of an artist who refused to allow\r\nhim to marry her because he was not a painter; for this reason Matsys\r\ndevoted himself to the study of art, and became the best Belgian master of\r\nhis time. His pictures of religious subjects are full of tender\r\nearnestness and deep feeling, and his most important work was an\r\naltar-piece which is now in the Museum of Antwerp. His scenes from common\r\nlife, his misers and lovers are spirited and truthful.\r\n\r\nHis portrait and that of his second wife, both painted by himself, are in\r\nthe gallery of the Uffizi in Florence. His works are not very numerous,\r\nbut they are seen in the principal galleries. He was buried in the\r\nCathedral of Antwerp, and a slab is inserted in the wall which tells his\r\nstory; one sentence is, \"_Connubialis amor de mulcibre fecit Apellene_\"\r\n(True love changed the smith to an Apelles).\r\n\r\nRubens is the next great master of whom I shall speak, but I wish to say\r\nthat during the last part of the sixteenth century there were many Flemish\r\npainters of considerable note whose pictures are seen in galleries, and\r\nare well worth consideration, but whose lives had no circumstances of\r\nespecial interest. Among the best of these artists were ANTONIO MORO,\r\nPETER POURBUS (1510-1583), and his son and grandson, both named Frans,\r\nPIETER BREUGHEL (1530-1569), and his sons Jan and Pieter the younger, and\r\nPAUL BRIL, an early Flemish landscape painter.\r\n\r\nAll the early Flemish pictures are very interesting, but in the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century a new manner of painting was introduced through\r\nthe genius of PETER PAUL RUBENS (1577-1640). This master was descended\r\nfrom two good families: his mother was of the distinguished family\r\nPypeling, and his father, John Rubens, was one of the two principal\r\nmagistrates of Antwerp. This city was the home of Rubens, although he was\r\nborn at Siegen, in the county of Nassau, during a time when his father was\r\nin exile on account of a civil war which was then raging. He was born June\r\n29th, the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul, and hence was named for those\r\napostles.\r\n\r\nHe was a bright, scholarly boy, and soon showed his love for drawing. When\r\nhe began to study art under Adam van Noort he had already a good\r\neducation. During the four years he passed with this teacher he learned\r\nthoroughly all the technical part of painting; then, in another four years\r\nunder Otto Vænius, he cultivated his taste and the more poetical elements\r\nof his nature, for Vænius was a very learned and elegant man. In 1598,\r\nwhen twenty-one years old, Rubens was admitted to the guild of painters in\r\nAntwerp. Two years later he went to Venice, and, after studying the works\r\nof Titian and Paul Veronese there, he entered the service of the Duke of\r\nMantua, to whom he had been recommended by the governor of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nWhile in Mantua he painted some fine pictures, and the duke sent him to\r\nRome to copy celebrated works there. Rubens also executed some other\r\norders in Rome, from which place he was recalled by the duke, who wished\r\nto send an envoy to Spain, and had chosen the young artist for that duty.\r\nHe showed great political ability in the way he conducted his embassy,\r\nand through his personal charms made many friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--RUBENS AND HIS SECOND WIFE.]\r\n\r\nAfter his return from Spain he went again to Rome and then to Genoa, and\r\nfinally, on account of the illness of his mother, he returned to Antwerp,\r\nhaving been absent seven years. His mother died before he reached her. He\r\nthen decided to remain in Antwerp, and built himself a fine house with a\r\ncharming studio. He soon married his first wife, Isabella Brant, and\r\nduring the next fifteen years led a very regular and industrious life, and\r\nexecuted many important works. He also received a large number of pupils\r\ninto his studio, and he has been accused of allowing them to paint\r\npictures which he called by his own name; but it is true that Rubens, with\r\nhis own hand, completed pictures of almost every kind, and so proved his\r\npower as an artist.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of study, and could read and speak seven languages. He was in\r\nthe habit of having some one read aloud to him while he painted, and\r\npreferred books of history and poetry. In 1620 he was invited to France by\r\nMarie de Medicis, for whom he executed many works. Among them the most\r\nimportant were scenes illustrating the life of this queen which decorate\r\nsome apartments in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nIn 1628 the Infanta Isabella sent him on a second mission to Spain, and\r\nwhile there he painted many grand and important pictures, which are fine\r\nexamples of his gorgeous coloring. He proved himself so good a diplomatist\r\nthat he was sent to England to try to make peace between that country and\r\nFlanders, in which he was successful. He was knighted by King Charles in\r\n1630, and received the same honor from the king of Spain.\r\n\r\nIn 1630 he married Helena Forment, a niece of his first wife, who was but\r\nsixteen years old. She became the mother of five children; he had two sons\r\nby his first marriage, to whom Gevartius was tutor. Rubens made so many\r\nportraits of both his wives and so often used them as models in painting\r\nhis large pictures, that their faces are familiar to all the world (Fig.\r\n55).\r\n\r\nRubens made a valuable collection of all sorts of beautiful objects, and\r\nlived luxuriously. After his death a portion of his collection was sold at\r\nprivate sale for more than seventy-five thousand dollars. His death\r\noccurred in 1640, and he was buried in a private chapel in the Church of\r\nSt. James in Antwerp; he had decorated this chapel with some works of his\r\nown. His family erected a monument to him, upon which an epitaph written\r\nby Gevartius was inscribed.\r\n\r\nIn painting Rubens was almost a universal genius, for he left a great\r\nvariety of works as well as a great number. About one thousand eight\r\nhundred are ascribed to him: doubtless his pupils did much work on these;\r\nbut there is something of himself in all. They include historical,\r\nscriptural, and mythological subjects, portraits, animals, _genre_\r\npictures, and landscapes. His style is a strange mingling of northern and\r\nsouthern elements. His handling and his arrangement of his subjects was\r\nlike that of the Italians; but his figures, even when he represented\r\nChrist and the holiest men, were like Spanish kings or German peasants, or\r\nsomebody whom he had seen.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to speak in detail of the works of Rubens. Some critics\r\ninsist that one class of his pictures is best, and some another. Of course\r\nthis depends largely upon the taste of those who make the judgment. It is\r\ncertain that he was a wonderful painter, and many of his pictures give\r\ngreat pleasure to those who visit the galleries where they are seen.\r\n\r\nHis pictures of children were so painted that they seem to have been done\r\nfrom pure love of the work. His portraits are splendid, his _genre_ scenes\r\ndelightful, and his landscapes fine; in short, the amount and variety of\r\nhis work is a proof of his great genius and industry, such as can\r\nscarcely be equalled in the history of painting. Yet it cannot be denied\r\nthat there is much incorrect drawing, unnatural coloring, and coarse, bad\r\ntaste in some of his works. On the other hand, the fertility of his\r\nimagination, his bold design and effective execution, as well as his\r\nbrilliant color, are all to be admired, and the name of Rubens stands high\r\non the list of Flemish artists who are famous the world over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--THE RETURN FROM EGYPT. _By Rubens._]\r\n\r\nFRANS SNYDERS (1579-1657) was born at Antwerp and lived in the time of\r\nRubens. He was a famous painter of animals, and it sometimes happened that\r\nthey worked together, Rubens painting the landscapes and figures and\r\nSnyders the animals in the same pictures. Snyders, like Rubens, excelled\r\nin representing animals in the most exciting moment of the combat or the\r\nchase, and his pictures are full of life. They are seen in all large\r\nEuropean galleries, and are much prized.\r\n\r\nJAN FYT (1609-1661), also born at Antwerp, is the greatest Flemish animal\r\npainter after Snyders. His greyhounds cannot be equalled, while his live\r\ndogs are wonderful; but his best pictures represent dead game. The fur and\r\nfeathers in his paintings are marvellously done, and his pictures are\r\namong the best in the world in which such subjects are treated.\r\n\r\nJACOB JORDAENS (1593-1678), another native of Antwerp, studied under Adam\r\nvan Noort at the same time with Rubens, but later in life he became a\r\nfollower and a sort of assistant of his former fellow-pupil. He married a\r\ndaughter of their old master and never visited Italy. His color was fine;\r\nin truth, he sometimes excelled Rubens himself in the \"golden glow\" which\r\nis much admired in his works. Many sacred pictures by Jordaens are seen in\r\nthe churches of Flanders. A fine historical work of his represents scenes\r\nfrom the life of Prince Frederick Henry of Orange, and is in the House of\r\nthe Wood, near the Hague; but the larger part of his pictures represent\r\nthe manners and customs of the common people, and are seen in public\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nThe greatest artist among the pupils of Rubens, as well as one of the\r\ngreatest of Flanders, was ANTHONY VANDYCK (1599-1641). He was born in\r\nAntwerp, and was the son of a silk merchant, this having been the\r\noccupation of the Vandycks for several generations. The mother of the\r\npainter was extremely skilled in various kinds of embroidery, and had such\r\nartistic tastes as enabled her to make many original designs, which she\r\nworked out with her needle in delicate and elaborate tapestry work.\r\n\r\nSome people believe that to this taste and talent of his mother's Vandyck\r\nowed the instinct for drawing which he early showed; at all events, she\r\ndid all she could to develop his taste, and when he was still a boy she\r\npersuaded her husband to place him under the teaching of Henry van Balen.\r\n\r\nHe was still quite young when he entered the studio of Rubens, and was\r\nsoon so much trusted by the master as to be allowed to make drawings from\r\nhis works for the use of the engravers. This sort of drawing must be done\r\nwith great care and exactness, and Vandyck must have had much skill to be\r\nfitted for it. His fellow-pupils also had great faith in him, as is shown\r\nby the story that one day, when Rubens had gone out, the young student\r\nbribed his old servant to show them the painting with which the master was\r\nthen occupied. While jostling each other it happened that one of them hit\r\nthe fresh picture, and injured it. They were much alarmed, and begged\r\nVandyck to repair it. After some hesitation he did so, and was so\r\nsuccessful that at first Rubens did not detect the fact that another had\r\nworked on the picture. When he did discover it, and learned the truth\r\nabout it he forgave the offence heartily.\r\n\r\nWhen Vandyck was nineteen years old he was admitted to the Society of\r\nArtists in Antwerp, an unusual honor to one of his age. In 1620 Vandyck\r\nwent to England, having been invited there through the Earl of Arundel.\r\nLittle is known of this visit, and two years later he was invited to the\r\nHague, where he spent several months.\r\n\r\nWhen Vandyck was passing through Haarlem he went to the studio of Franz\r\nHals, who was at a tavern just then. A message was sent him saying that a\r\nstranger desired to have his portrait made, and had but two hours to spare\r\nfor it. Hals hastened home and dashed off the portrait within the time\r\nstated. Vandyck then said, \"Portrait-painting seems to be a simple thing;\r\ntake my place, and give me the brush for awhile.\" Hals complied with the\r\nrequest and Vandyck made his portrait with great celerity. Seeing this,\r\nHals cried out, \"You are Vandyck; he alone can do such work.\"\r\n\r\nThe young artist was suddenly called to the death-bed of his father, who\r\ncommanded him to paint a picture for the Dominican Sisters who had cared\r\nfor his father in his illness. Seven years later Vandyck presented the\r\nSisters with a Crucifixion. At the foot of the cross was a rock upon which\r\nwas inscribed, in Latin, \"Lest the earth should be heavy upon the remains\r\nof his father, Anthony Vandyck moved this rock to the foot of the cross,\r\nand gave it to this place.\" When the monasteries were broken up, this\r\npicture was purchased for two thousand seven hundred dollars for the\r\nAntwerp Academy, where it now is.\r\n\r\nAt length Vandyck prepared to set out for Italy. When he paid his farewell\r\nvisit to Rubens he presented the master with three of his pictures, and in\r\nreturn Rubens gave him one of his finest horses. As Vandyck was on his way\r\nfrom Antwerp to Brussels he halted at the village of Saventhem, where he\r\nfell in love with Anna van Ophem, and so stayed on in the lovely valley of\r\nFlanders, week after week, as if he had forgotten that Italy existed. Anna\r\npersuaded him to paint a picture for the village church, and he executed\r\na Holy Family in which the Virgin was a portrait of Anna, and St. Joachim\r\nand St. Anna were drawn from her father and mother. This picture pleased\r\nthe church authorities so much that they gave the young painter an order\r\nfor another, which represented St. Martin dividing his cloak with beggars.\r\nIn this work the saint was a portrait of Vandyck, and the horse on which\r\nhe rode was like that which Rubens had given him.\r\n\r\nThis picture has quite a history. In 1758 the priest agreed to sell it to\r\na collector from the Hague for one thousand eight hundred dollars; but\r\nwhen the villagers knew of it they surrounded the church with clubs and\r\npitchforks, and drove the purchaser away. In 1806, when the French\r\ninvaders tried to carry it away, the people again prevented it, and they\r\nwere forced to call more soldiers from Brussels before they succeeded in\r\ntaking it. The St. Martin was placed in the Gallery of the Louvre, at\r\nParis, but was restored to Saventhem in 1815. About 1850 a rich American\r\noffered twenty thousand dollars for the picture, no matter who brought it\r\nto him. Upon this a set of rogues tried to steal it at night; but the dogs\r\nof the village gave such an alarm that the town was roused, and the\r\nrobbers escaped with difficulty. Since then a guardian sleeps in the\r\nchurch, and the St. Martin is still there.\r\n\r\nThe news that Vandyck was thus lingering on his way to Italy reached the\r\nears of Rubens, and he sent such urgent messages to his pupil as induced\r\nhim to continue his journey, and he also sent him letters of introduction\r\nto artists and to nobles whom the master had known when he made his\r\nstudies beyond the Alps.\r\n\r\nVandyck went first to Venice, where he worked hard to copy and learn to\r\nimitate the rich color and refined manner of Titian and other Venetian\r\nmasters. He also painted some original pictures in Venice, and made many\r\nportraits which gave him fame in that and other cities. He was asked to\r\ngo to other places for the painting of portraits; but he remained in\r\nVenice until his money was spent, and then went to Genoa, where he was\r\nwell received and generously employed by the old friends of Rubens. His\r\nworks are still to be seen in some of the palaces of that city, while some\r\nhave been sold and carried to other countries--they were so fine that they\r\nstill maintain the name which they gained for him when they were executed.\r\nThe principal work done in Genoa was a picture of the Lomellini family\r\nwhich is now in Edinburgh; it is about nine feet square. His different\r\nvisits to Genoa during his absence in Italy make up a period of about\r\nthree years, and he did a vast amount of work there.\r\n\r\nWhen he first went to Rome Vandyck was invited to the house of Cardinal\r\nBentivoglio, who had been papal nuncio to Flanders, and for whom our\r\nartist made a picture of the Crucifixion. The full-length portrait which\r\nVandyck painted of the cardinal is now in Florence; a copy of it is in one\r\nof the halls of Harvard College. It is one of the finest among the many\r\nsplendid portraits by this great master.\r\n\r\nVandyck was fascinated with Rome, but he was so unpopular with the other\r\nFlemish painters there that he shortened his stay in the Eternal City in\r\norder to escape the vexations he there received. The artists disliked him\r\nfor his ostentation, and he was called _Il pittore cavalieresco_--and he\r\noffended them by declining to associate with them at taverns or to join\r\ntheir coarse festivities. After leaving Rome he visited Palermo, from\r\nwhich place he was driven away by the appearance of the plague. He\r\nreturned to Genoa, visited Florence and other cities in the north of\r\nItaly, and finally returned to Antwerp after an absence of four years.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years after his return he met with small success--Rubens\r\nwas so great that he filled all the space about him--but at last, in 1628,\r\nVandyck began to receive important commissions, and from this time was\r\nconstantly busy with works for the churches of the Low Countries. He also\r\npainted portraits of many notable persons, and made great numbers of them\r\nin brown and white for the use of engravers. While Vandyck was thus\r\nexecuting great numbers of fine pictures for the embellishment of\r\nFlanders, he became so unpopular and his rivals said such hard things of\r\nhim that he determined to go away. One of his unfortunate experiences was\r\nin the house of the bishop, who had sent for him to paint his portrait.\r\nVandyck had first sent his implements to the care of the porter of the\r\npalace. When he went himself he was taken into the presence of the bishop,\r\nwho was reclining on a sofa, and gave little attention to the artist. At\r\nlast the bishop asked if he had not come to paint his portrait. Vandyck\r\ndeclared himself to be quite at the service of his lordship. \"Why, then,\"\r\nsaid the bishop, \"do you not go for your implements? Do you expect me to\r\nfetch them for you?\" Vandyck calmly replied, \"Since you have not ordered\r\nyour servants to bring them I supposed that you wished to do it yourself.\"\r\nThen the bishop leaped up in anger and cried out, \"Anthony, Anthony, you\r\nare a little asp, but you have a great deal of venom!\" Vandyck thought it\r\nsafe to make his escape, and after he crossed the threshold he called\r\nback, \"My lord Van der Burch, you are a voluminous personage, but you are\r\nlike the cinnamon tree. The bark is the best part of you.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1629 Vandyck went to England with the hope of being employed by King\r\nCharles I.; but he was not able even to get an introduction to the\r\nsovereign, and went to the continent filled with mortification. At length,\r\nhowever, Charles called him to London, whither he went in 1632, and soon\r\nbecame the friend of the king as well as his favorite artist. He was\r\nassigned a city and a country residence, and within three months of the\r\ntime of his arrival at court the king knighted him, and gave him a gold\r\nchain with a portrait of himself set in brilliants suspended from it.\r\nCharles was in the habit of passing much time with Vandyck, and the studio\r\nof the court-painter became one of the most fashionable resorts in London\r\nfor the courtiers and other distinguished people.\r\n\r\nVandyck kept up a fine establishment, and lived luxuriously. He had a\r\nhabit of asking his sitters to dinner; thus he could study their faces and\r\nretouch their portraits with the more natural expressions of their\r\nconversational hours, for it is rare that one is natural when posing\r\nbefore an artist who is painting one's portrait. But in the midst of his\r\nbusy life as an artist and his gay life as a man of the world, Sir Anthony\r\ndid not forget the needs of his brother painters. There was at that time\r\nno club or place where artists met socially to consult and aid each other\r\nin their profession. Vandyck founded the Club of St. Luke; it met at the\r\nRose Tavern, and all painters of talent living in London joined it. One of\r\nthe more personal acts of kindness which are related of him is that having\r\nseen by chance a picture which was painted by William Dobson, Vandyck\r\nsought him out, found him in a poor garret, instructed him with great\r\ncare, introduced him to the king, and, in short, by his kind offices so\r\nprepared the way that Dobson was made sergeant-painter to the king after\r\nVandyck's death, and won the title of \"the English Tintoretto.\"\r\n\r\nThe portraits which Vandyck executed in England are numbered by hundreds\r\nand are magnificent pictures. Those of the royal family are very numerous\r\nand important, and there is scarcely a man or woman belonging to this\r\nperiod whose name has come down to us in history or literature, whose\r\nportrait he did not paint. He also made thirteen portraits of himself\r\nwhich are still preserved. He was very skilful in painting horses and\r\ndogs, and frequently introduced these animals into his portrait groups.\r\n\r\nThere is a large collection of the pictures of Vandyck at Windsor Castle;\r\nthere are many also in the private galleries of Great Britain and other\r\ncountries, besides a goodly number in the public galleries of Europe. He\r\nexecuted at least thirty-six portraits of Charles I., as many as\r\ntwenty-five of Queen Henrietta Maria, and he also painted several groups\r\nof the children of the royal pair. Prince Rupert of the Rhine and Thomas\r\nWentworth, Earl of Strafford, were also frequently portrayed by him, and\r\none of his most important large works was a family picture of the Earl of\r\nPembroke and his household. It is called the Wilton Family, as it is in a\r\nsalon at Wilton House; it contains eleven figures, and has been called\r\n\"the first and most magnificent historic portraiture in the world.\" Again,\r\nit is said to be stiff, wanting in harmony, bad in color, and so on, but\r\nafter all it still remains a splendid monument to the skill and genius of\r\nVandyck. The picture is twenty feet long by twelve feet high.\r\n\r\nVandyck painted no portraits of the Puritans nor popular leaders of his\r\nday; neither did he of the literary men who flourished at that time, with\r\nthe exception of the court poets, Sir John Suckling and Thomas Carew.\r\n\r\nI shall not give a list of Vandyck's historical and religious pictures,\r\nthough they are quite numerous. They are not as interesting as his\r\nportraits, and we have not space to give them. His ambition, however, was\r\nnever satisfied, for he wished to do some great historical work. At one\r\ntime his opportunity seemed to have come, for the great banqueting-room of\r\nWhitehall Palace, the ceiling of which Rubens had painted, still remained\r\nwith plain walls. Vandyck desired to paint on them the history of the\r\nOrder of the Garter. The project was laid before the king, and he desired\r\nsketches to be made for the work, and one of them, the \"Procession of the\r\nKnights of the Garter,\" was sold after the execution of the king for five\r\npounds. It was owned by Sir Peter Lely and Sir Joshua Reynolds, and is\r\nnow at Belvoir in the collection of the Duke of Rutland. We cannot help\r\nbeing sorry for Vandyck's great disappointment when he knew that his work\r\ncould not be done. He was weak in health and much in debt, for the king\r\ncould not pay him his pension nor what he owed him for pictures. The\r\nartist grew sad and discouraged. He sought relief in the study of alchemy,\r\nand indulged the vain hope of discovering some chemical means of making\r\ngold from base metals. All this wasted his time and means, and it is to be\r\nregretted that he was less wise than his master, for when an alchemist\r\ntried to interest Rubens in the same subject, that great artist replied:\r\n\"You come too late, my good fellow; I have long since discovered the\r\nphilosopher's stone. My palette and brushes are worth far more than any\r\nother secret.\"\r\n\r\nThe king and all Vandyck's friends were troubled by his state of health\r\nand mind, and a marriage was brought about for him with the hope that he\r\nwould be a happier man. His wife was Maria Ruthven, a lovely Scotch girl\r\nwho held a high position among the attendants of the queen. Not long after\r\nhis marriage Vandyck took her to Flanders, where he enjoyed much the\r\nhonorable reception which he met with in revisiting the scenes of his\r\nchildhood and youth. But having learned that Louis XIII. was about to\r\nadorn a large gallery in the Louvre, Vandyck hastened to Paris hoping to\r\nobtain the commission. He was too late--the work had been given to\r\nPoussin, and Vandyck returned to London greatly disheartened.\r\n\r\nWhile at Antwerp he had received much attention, as, indeed, had been the\r\ncase before, for in 1634 he had been elected Dean of the Confraternity of\r\nSt. Luke and a great feast was held in his honor. When he came now to\r\nLondon the social atmosphere was full of sadness. The political troubles,\r\nwhich were finally so terrible in England, had already become alarming.\r\nIn a few months the Earl of Strafford was executed, and Vandyck saw the\r\nroyal family, to whom he was so much attached, surrounded with danger and\r\nat last separated.\r\n\r\nHis physical health was already delicate, and his sorrows brought on a\r\ndisease from which he soon died. He continued to work until the very last\r\ndays of his life. Eight days before his death his daughter was born; she\r\nwas named Justiniana, and when she grew up married an English baronet, Sir\r\nJohn Stepney.\r\n\r\nA short time before Vandyck died the king came from the North to London,\r\nand though he was overburdened with his own cares and griefs he found time\r\nto sorrow for the condition of his friend and artist. He offered his\r\nphysician three hundred pounds if he would save the life of Sir Anthony;\r\nbut nothing availed to baffle his disease, and he died December 9, 1641.\r\nTwo days later he was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. It is said that many\r\nnobles and artists attended his funeral, which was conducted with\r\nimpressive ceremony. The fire which destroyed St. Paul's made it\r\nimpossible to say exactly where Vandyck was laid, but his coffin-plate was\r\nfound at the time of the burial of Benjamin West.\r\n\r\nThere were no artists of importance after the time of Rubens and his\r\nfollowers whom we call Flemish artists. There were good painters,\r\ncertainly, belonging to the schools of Flanders; but these schools had\r\nreached their highest excellence and were on the decline, and so we pass\r\nto the Dutch school, or the painters of Holland.\r\n\r\nThere was doubtless a very early school of Dutch painters, dating back to\r\nthe fourteenth century even; but the records of it are so imperfect, and\r\nso few pictures remain from its early days, that for our purpose it is\r\nbest to pass over the fifteenth century and say that during the sixteenth\r\ncentury the painters of Holland gave up the painting of sacred subjects\r\nvery largely, and began to take on the characteristics of what is\r\ngenerally known now as the Dutch School. This school is distinguished for\r\nits portraits, which form a large and important part of its painting; next\r\nfor its domestic scenes, which are realistic and true to life in an\r\nastonishing degree.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century Holland had obtained a\r\nposition as a nation that freed its artists from the influence of the\r\nRomish Church and the fear of the Inquisition, and they soon used their\r\nfreedom to establish a national art, and one which became very important\r\nto the world. FRANZ HALS (1584-1666) was the most noteworthy of the\r\nportrait-painters. He was born at Mechlin, but passed most of his life at\r\nHaarlem. There was a custom in Holland of painting portraits of the\r\nmembers of guilds and societies in groups, and some such works of his at\r\nHaarlem are very fine. I have told a story of his rapid manner in the\r\nsketch of Vandyck. He was the first master to introduce that free, bold,\r\nsleight-of-hand manner which was afterward used by the Dutch masters, and\r\nis so strong in its effect. This painter led a merry, careless life. His\r\nportraits of single heads or figures are rare, and his small _genre_\r\nsubjects still more so. In the Hôtel de Ville at Haarlem there are as many\r\nas eight of his large works, most of them having ten or a dozen portraits.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch painters of still-life--flowers, dead game and poultry, and\r\nmetals, glass, and other beautiful objects--were very skilful, and have\r\nnever been surpassed. The names of these masters would make a long list.\r\nThere is little to be told of the circumstances of their lives, though\r\ntheir works are seen in most European galleries, and well repay one for\r\ncareful examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--PORTRAIT OF AN OFFICER. _By Franz Hals._]\r\n\r\nAnother form of Dutch art is the representation of scenes from peasant\r\nlife, and there were some very eminent painters who devoted themselves to\r\nthese subjects entirely. The interiors of inns with men smoking and\r\ndrinking, playing cards or making jokes, were subjects many times\r\nrepeated; dancing villagers, fêtes, and fairs were often pictured, and in\r\nall these scenes everything was given exactly to the life. It follows that\r\nthese pictures of coarse, vulgar people engaged in rude amusements cannot\r\nbe beautiful; but they are oftentimes wonderful. Among the most noted\r\nnames in this kind of painting are those of Adrian Brauwer, the Van\r\nOstades, the Teniers, and Jan Steen. Most of these artists executed small\r\npictures only. I shall speak particularly of but one of these Dutch\r\n_genre_ painters--DAVID TENIERS the younger (1610-1694), who became the\r\ngreatest painter of his time of scenes from common life. This is very\r\ngreat praise, because there were many Dutch and several Flemish painters\r\nwho were noted for such pictures. This Teniers studied with his father,\r\nbut his works show that he was much influenced by Rubens. He excelled in\r\nguard-house scenes and peasant life in every aspect. In representations of\r\nthe alchemist also he was unequalled, as well as in fairs and festivals of\r\nevery sort. He sometimes painted sacred subjects, but they are the least\r\npraiseworthy of all his works.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of Teniers are very numerous. One author describes nine\r\nhundred of his works which are known to be genuine, and it is believed\r\nthat there may be one hundred more. He often represented a great number of\r\nfigures on one canvas. At Schleissheim there was a large picture, thirteen\r\nand a half feet by ten feet in size, which contained one thousand one\r\nhundred and thirty-eight figures. It was not unusual for him to paint from\r\none hundred and fifty to three hundred figures in a single picture of\r\nmoderate size. He had a light, brilliant touch, his color was exquisite,\r\nand his arrangement of his subjects was very picturesque. His chief fault\r\nwas a resemblance in his heads, and for this reason those pictures with\r\nthe fewest figures are his best works.\r\n\r\nTeniers had several royal patrons, and earned sufficient money to live in\r\nhandsome style in his home in Perck, not far from Mechlin. He chose this\r\nplace in order to be near the peasant classes, whose life was his chief\r\nstudy. He also excelled in his ability to imitate the styles of other\r\nmasters. In the Vienna Gallery there is a curious work of his which\r\nrepresents the walls of a room hung with fifty pictures, imitating those\r\nof various Italian masters; in the foreground are portraits of Teniers and\r\nthe Archduke Leopold William, who are represented as conversing with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nTeniers reached his excellence early in life, and was but twenty-two years\r\nold when he was admitted to the Guild of Painters at Antwerp. That Rubens\r\nwas his friend is proved by the fact that when Teniers married the\r\ndaughter of Jan Breughel, in 1637, that great master was one of the\r\nwitnesses to the ceremony. In 1656 he married his second wife, the\r\ndaughter of the Secretary of State for Brabant. By his artistic and\r\npersonal merits Teniers gained a higher place in society than was ever\r\nheld by any other _genre_ painter of the Flemish or Dutch schools. He was\r\neighty-four years old when he died, and was active and industrious up to\r\nthe close of his life.\r\n\r\nAlthough Teniers had such good fortune during his life, I fancy he would\r\nhave been surprised if he could have known what his fame would be now, or\r\nwhat prices would be paid for his pictures about two centuries after his\r\ndeath. The \"Flemish Kermes\" was bought for the Brussels Museum in 1867 for\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars, and at the San Donato sale, in 1880, the\r\n\"Prodigal Son\" sold for sixteen thousand two hundred dollars, and the\r\n\"Five Senses\" for fifteen thousand dollars. It is difficult to distinguish\r\nthe etchings of the son from those of the father, David Teniers the elder,\r\nthough it is well known that the son executed such works.\r\n\r\nGERARD HONTHORST (1592-1660) was also a painter of _genre_ scenes, and\r\nmany of his works had figures of life size. His chief distinction,\r\nhowever, was that of painting the effects of artificial lights. He was\r\nfamous in England and Italy as well as in his own country, and the\r\nItalians called him \"_Gherardo della Notte_,\" or Gerard of the Night,\r\nbecause he painted so many night-scenes lighted by candles, lamps, and\r\ntorches.\r\n\r\nThen there was a class of Dutch artists who represented the interiors of\r\nfine houses--rooms with all sorts of beautiful furniture and ornaments,\r\nwith ladies and gentlemen in splendid costumes. They tried to show the\r\neffects of light upon satins, glass, metals, and other shining objects.\r\nThey painted with great care, and finished their pictures in the most\r\nperfect manner. GERHARD TERBURG (1608-1681), GERHARD DOW (1613-1675), and\r\nGABRIEL METSU (1615-after 1667) were all remarkable for works of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nPIETER DE HOOGE, who worked from 1628 to 1671, and of whose life little is\r\nknown, painted similar pictures of court-yards as well as of rooms in\r\nhouses. The list of the names of all these Dutch masters cannot be given\r\nhere, and I hasten to tell you of one whose name and fame is so great that\r\nwhen we hear of Dutch art we always think first of him, because he stands\r\nout as its head.\r\n\r\nREMBRANDT VAN RYN (1607-1669) was born at Leyden, and was educated by his\r\nparents with the hope that he would be a scholar and a prominent man in\r\nLeyden. But his taste for drawing and painting would not be put aside, and\r\nin 1620 he entered the studio of J. J. van Swanenburg, where he learned\r\nthe first lessons in his art, and was then placed under the teaching of\r\nPieter Lastman in Amsterdam, where he remained only six months, after\r\nwhich he returned to his father's house, and there lived for seven years.\r\nHe was not far from seventeen years old when he thus left the usual course\r\nof study. From this time he gave himself up to close observation of nature\r\nin every form.\r\n\r\nHe studied broad landscapes--farms, groves, gardens, rivers, canals,\r\nsunshine, clouds, and shadows, and with and above all these, the human\r\nfaces that he saw, as well as the varying forms, movements, and\r\npeculiarities of the men and women about him. That nothing escaped his\r\nobservation is proved by the works he did in later life.\r\n\r\nIn 1630 Rembrandt settled in Amsterdam, which was called the \"Venice of\r\nthe North,\" and was the centre of northern commerce, civilization, and the\r\nactivity of political and intellectual life. Rembrandt was no sooner\r\nestablished in his studio on one of the western quays than he was pressed\r\nwith orders for pictures and applications from young men who desired his\r\ninstructions. The years following were crowded with work--with painting\r\nand engraving. Rembrandt is called the \"Prince of Etchers,\" and he used\r\nthe etching needle most skilfully, but he also employed the dry-point and\r\neven the graver in finishing. Thus he may be said to have established a\r\nnew school of engraving of great excellence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--ONE OF REMBRANDT'S PORTRAITS OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that in these early years one of his amusements was to make\r\netchings of himself. In one year, 1630-31, he made nineteen of these\r\nportraits in different costumes and positions, with as many kinds of\r\nexpression on his face. He often repeated the portrait of his mother also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--THE LECTURE ON ANATOMY. _By Rembrandt._]\r\n\r\nIn 1632 he painted the \"School of Anatomy,\" now one of the gems of the\r\nfine gallery at the Hague. It represents a lecture by Professor Tulp, who\r\nis dissecting the arm of a dead body and explaining its structure to seven\r\nother surgeons. It is a wonderful picture and one of the most famous works\r\nof this great master. In 1828 it was sold for the benefit of the fund for\r\nsurgeons' widows, and the Dutch Government paid thirty-two thousand\r\nflorins for it. This picture is in a certain way a portrait picture, and\r\ncomes within the class of Dutch pictures of which I have spoken as\r\nportraits of guilds and societies; for Tulp was very famous, and Rembrandt\r\nprobably attended his lectures, and was chosen by him to be the painter of\r\nthis celebrated portrait of himself surrounded by members of his guild.\r\n\r\nRembrandt's influence upon the art of his time was very great almost from\r\nthe beginning of his career. About 1634 he introduced his manner of\r\nportrait-painting, with dark backgrounds and deep shadows on the face,\r\nwith a bright light on the cheek and nose passing down to the shoulder,\r\nand immediately other artists adopted this manner. They considered it a\r\nnecessity to imitate him, so much was he admired.\r\n\r\nIn 1634 Rembrandt married Saskia van Ulenburg, who was very beautiful and\r\nof an aristocratic and wealthy family. She was only twenty-one years of\r\nage when she married, and Rembrandt painted many portraits of her besides\r\nmaking her his model for beautiful figures in his mythological and sacred\r\nsubjects. She lived but eight years after her marriage, which were the\r\nhappiest of the artist's life. She left but one child, a son named Titus,\r\nand showed her confidence in her husband by leaving all her fortune to\r\nhim, with the single stipulation that their son should be properly\r\neducated.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Saskia it seems that the only thought of the master was\r\nto work without rest, and in this way to drown the remembrance of his\r\nsorrow. There is little material for a story of his life--it is told in\r\nhis pictures. The house in which Saskia lived was very fine, and Rembrandt\r\nwas so fond of collecting all sorts of curious and beautiful objects that\r\nhe finally made himself poor, and his collection was sold. He never\r\ntravelled, and some writers have said that he was ignorant of classic art;\r\nbut the list of his collections proves that he had busts of Homer and\r\nSocrates and copies of ancient sculptures, such as the \"Laöcoon,\" a\r\n\"Cupid,\" and so on. He also had pictures of some of the best Italian\r\nmasters. After the sale of his home and all his rare objects he hired a\r\nhouse on the Rosengracht near the West Church. This house still stands,\r\nand has a shield dated 1652, though the artist did not live there until\r\n1658.\r\n\r\nHis life here was not lonely or desolate. He had many friends in Amsterdam\r\nwho did not forget him. He was near the bastions of the city, and had not\r\nfar to go to sketch, as he loved to do, and he was busy with his brush\r\nuntil 1662, when he did nothing of which we know. In 1666 he executed four\r\npictures. Among his works of 1667 there is a portrait of himself which is\r\nof great interest. In October, 1668, Rembrandt died after a short illness.\r\nHe was buried in the West Church, and his funeral was so simple that its\r\ncost was registered as only fifteen florins.\r\n\r\nRembrandt's pictures are so numerous and so varied in their subjects that\r\nno adequate list or account of them can be given here. And his numerous\r\nengravings are as interesting as his pictures, so that a volume would\r\nscarcely suffice to do him justice; but I will try to tell something of\r\nhis style. His management of light was his most striking characteristic.\r\nHe generally threw a strong, vivid light upon the central or important\r\nobject, whether it was a single figure or a group, and the rest of the\r\npicture was in shadow. This is true of all his works, almost without\r\nexception--portraits, pictures both large and small, and etchings.\r\n\r\nRembrandt loved to paint unusual things. We are apt to think that an\r\nunusual thing is not natural; but if we closely observe nature, especially\r\nthe effect of light and shade, we shall find that no imagination could\r\nmake pictures more wonderful than the reality we see. Rembrandt had that\r\nkeen observation that helped him to seize upon the sharp features--the\r\nstrong points in a scene or a person--and then he had the skill to\r\nreproduce these things on his canvas with great truth.\r\n\r\nHis etchings are much prized. One of the most famous represents Christ\r\nhealing the sick, and is called the \"Hundred Guilders Print,\" because that\r\nsum was the price he fixed for it; now a good impression of it is worth\r\nten times as much. At his death he left about six hundred pictures and\r\nfour hundred engravings. His landscapes are his rarest subjects. Most of\r\nthese are in private collections, but I have seen one in the Cassel\r\nGallery; the color of it is bright and glowing--the sky magnificent. In\r\nthe foreground there is a bridge, and on an eminence are the ruins of a\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nSome fine works by Rembrandt are in England, and very large prices have\r\nbeen paid for them. In 1867 \"Christ Blessing Little Children\" was sold for\r\nseven thousand pounds. At the San Donato sale in Florence, in 1880,\r\n\"Lucretia\" brought twenty-nine thousand two hundred dollars, and a\r\n\"Portrait of a Young Woman\" nearly as much.\r\n\r\nAmong Rembrandt's pupils Gerbrandt van der Eeckhout holds a high rank, and\r\nhis pictures are seen in many galleries.\r\n\r\nAmong the landscape painters of Holland ALBERT CUYP (1605-1691) is very\r\nfamous. He sometimes introduced figures and animals into his pictures, but\r\nthey were of secondary importance; the scenery was his chief thought. His\r\nworks are in many galleries, and the increase in their value is\r\nmarvellous. Sir Robert Peel bought a landscape, twelve by twenty inches\r\nin size, for which he paid three hundred and fifty guineas: it was\r\noriginally sold in Holland for about one English shilling! During the\r\nfirst century after his death no picture by Cuyp brought more than thirty\r\nflorins; now they cost almost their weight in gold.\r\n\r\nOther fine landscape painters were Jan and Andries Both, Jan van Goyen,\r\nJan Wynants, Adrian van de Velde, and, finally, PHILIP WOUVERMAN\r\n(1619-1668), who introduced much life into his works. He painted battles,\r\nhunting parties, and such subjects as allowed him to introduce white\r\nhorses, for which he became noted. His works, as well as those of the\r\nother painters last mentioned, are valuable. There are so many in\r\ngalleries which are attributed to Wouverman that it is doubtful if they\r\nare all genuine. He had animation and fine feeling for the picturesque.\r\nHis execution was light and delicate, and there is much tenderness shown\r\nin his works. There were many excellent Dutch landscape painters whom we\r\nhave not mentioned.\r\n\r\nPAUL POTTER (1625-1654) was born at Enkhuysen, and though he died young he\r\nmade himself a great and enduring reputation by his pictures of animals.\r\n\"Paul Potter's Bull,\" which is in the gallery at the Hague, is as well\r\nknown as any one picture the world over. He left one hundred and eight\r\npictures and eighteen etchings. He was most successful in representing\r\ncattle and sheep; his horses are not as fine. He never crowded his\r\npictures; they have an open landscape, but few animals, and perhaps a\r\nshepherd, and that is all. Some of his pictures have been valued as high\r\nas fifty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nJACOB RUYSDAEL (1625-1681) was born in the same year with Paul Potter. His\r\nbirth-place was Haarlem. He came to be the very best of all Dutch\r\nlandscape painters, and though most of his pictures represent the dull,\r\nuninteresting scenery of Holland, they are so skilfully drawn and painted\r\nthat they are really most attractive, if not cheerful. His works number\r\nabout four hundred and forty-eight pictures and seven fine, spirited\r\netchings. He was fond of giving a broad, expansive effect to his pictures,\r\nand frequently placed church spires in the distance. He painted a few\r\nmarine views with rough seas and cloudy skies. Though many of his works\r\nare gloomy, he sometimes painted sunshine with much effect. Some of his\r\nfinest works are in the Dresden Gallery.\r\n\r\nMINDERT HOBBEMA was a pupil of Jacob Ruysdael, and this is almost all that\r\nis known of him personally; but his pictures show that he was a great\r\nlandscape painter. They sell for enormous sums, and many of the best are\r\nin England. Most of those seen in the continental galleries are not those\r\nhe should be judged by. At the San Donato sale in Florence, his picture of\r\nthe \"Wind-Mills\" sold for forty-two thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe number of reputable Dutch painters is very large, but I shall mention\r\nno more names. After the great men whom we have spoken of there comes an\r\narmy of those who are called \"little Dutch masters,\" and their principal\r\nwork was making copies from the pictures of the greater artists.\r\n\r\nIn the history of what we know as German art we find a very early school\r\nat Cologne, but the records of it are so scarce and imperfect that I shall\r\ngive no account of it here. At Augsburg there was an important school of\r\nart which commenced with the Holbeins. The first Hans Holbein is known as\r\n\"Old Holbein,\" and so little is known of him that I shall merely give his\r\nname. The second HANS HOLBEIN, called the elder (1460-1523), painted a\r\ngreat number of religious pictures, which are seen in various churches and\r\ngalleries in Germany. Some of the best are in the Cathedral of Augsburg.\r\nIn one salon of the Munich Pinakothek there are sixteen panels painted by\r\nhim. But it was HANS HOLBEIN the third, known as \"the younger,\" who\r\nreached the perfection of his school (1495-1543). This painter was\r\ninstructed by his father and by Hans Burgkmair. He was but fifteen years\r\nof age when he began to receive commissions for pictures. When he was\r\nabout twenty-one years old he removed to Basle, and there he painted many\r\npictures, though not nearly as many as have been called by his name.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after Holbein went to Basle he was called to Lucerne to\r\ndecorate a house, and he executed other works there and at Altorf. In\r\n1519, when he had been three years in Basle, he became a citizen of that\r\ntown and a member of its guild of painters. His works at Basle were mostly\r\ndecorative, and he painted few easel pictures there.\r\n\r\nHolbein married a widow with one son; her name was Elizabeth Schmid. She\r\nhad a very bad temper. It is said that she made Holbein's life so\r\nmiserable that he left Basle for that reason. He visited her sometimes,\r\nand always gave her money, but lived away from her. In 1526 Holbein went\r\nto England, and his friend Erasmus said that he went because he had so\r\nlittle to do in Basle. He carried a letter to Sir Thomas More, who\r\nreceived him with great kindness, and the artist made many portraits of\r\nSir Thomas and his family. There is a story about one of these portraits\r\nof that nobleman. He had refused to be present at the marriage of Anne\r\nBoleyn to King Henry VIII., and she never forgave him. On the day that\r\nMore was executed she looked at one of Holbein's portraits of the\r\nex-chancellor and exclaimed, \"Ah, me! the man seems to be still alive;\"\r\nand seizing the picture she threw it into the street.\r\n\r\nIn 1530 Holbein returned to Basle to complete some unfinished frescoes,\r\nand this being done he went again to London. About this time he began to\r\nbe employed by the king, and did many pictures for him from time to time.\r\nIn 1538 Henry sent Holbein to Brussels to make a portrait of the Duchess\r\nof Milan, of whom the king was thinking for his fourth wife. No citizen of\r\nBasle was allowed to enter the service of a foreign sovereign without the\r\nconsent of the council, so in 1538 the artist went home to ask permission\r\nto serve the King of England. Great efforts were made to keep him in\r\nBasle, but at last he received permission to remain two years in England:\r\nthe artist never went again to Basle. Henry VIII. became fond of Holbein,\r\nand was generous to him, even giving him a painting-room in the palace of\r\nWhitehall.\r\n\r\nIn 1539 the artist was sent to paint a portrait of Anne of Cleves, whom\r\nthe king married the next year. It has been said that the picture was so\r\nflattering that when the king saw the lady he was disappointed; we know\r\nthat he was soon divorced from her.\r\n\r\nIn 1543 the plague raged in London, and on the 7th of October Holbein\r\nprepared his will. He died before the 29th of November, but the facts\r\nconcerning his death and burial are not known.\r\n\r\nThere are several interesting anecdotes of Holbein. One relates that when\r\npassing through Strasburg he visited the studio of an artist, and finding\r\nhim out, painted a fly on a picture which was on an easel. When the\r\npainter saw the fly he tried to brush it away, and when he found who had\r\npainted it he searched the city for Holbein; but he had already left for\r\nEngland. Another story shows the regard which Henry VIII. had for him. One\r\nday a nobleman went to Holbein's studio, and insisted upon entering,\r\nthough the artist told him that he was painting the portrait of a lady by\r\nhis Majesty's orders. The nobleman persisting, Holbein threw him down the\r\nstairs with great violence, and then rushed to the king, and told him what\r\nhe had done. Soon after the nobleman was borne to the presence of the\r\nking; he was unable to walk, and was loud in his complaints. The king\r\nridiculed him, and the nobleman was angry, and threatened to punish the\r\nartist legally. Then Henry got angry, and said: \"Now you have no longer to\r\ndeal with Holbein, but with me, your king. Do you think that this man is\r\nof so little consideration with us? I tell you, my lord, that out of seven\r\npeasants I can make seven earls in a day; but out of seven earls I could\r\nnot make one such artist as Hans Holbein.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--BURGOMASTER MEIER MADONNA. _By Holbein. Dresden\r\nGallery._]\r\n\r\nAt Basle one may see some of the most important of the early portraits of\r\nHolbein; these are in the gallery where are also his ten well-known scenes\r\nfrom the Passion of Christ. While at Basle he probably made the designs\r\nfor the \"Dance of Death.\" For a long time it was believed that he painted\r\nthis subject both at Basle and at Bonn, but we now know that he only made\r\ndesigns for it. He also decorated the Town Hall at Basle; of this work,\r\nhowever, but little remains.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated work by Holbein is the \"Meyer Madonna\" in the royal\r\npalace of Darmstadt, of which there is a copy in the Dresden Gallery. It\r\ntakes its name from that of the Burgomaster Meyer, for whom it was\r\npainted. The Madonna, with the infant Jesus in her arms, stands in a niche\r\nin the centre of the picture; the burgomaster and his family kneel before\r\nher. This is what is called a votive picture, which means a picture made\r\nin the fulfilment of a vow, in gratitude for some signal blessing or to\r\nturn away some danger. Many of these works commemorate an escape from\r\naccident or a recovery from sickness.\r\n\r\nThe picture is very beautiful, and it seems as if the Virgin wished to\r\nshare her peace with the kneeling family, so sweet is the expression of\r\nher face, while the child seems to bestow a blessing with his lifted hand.\r\nThe original was probably painted for a \"Chapel of Our Lady.\"\r\n\r\nHis \"Dance of Death\" was very curious, the idea being that Death is always\r\nnear us and trying to strike down his prey. The pictures represent a\r\nskeleton clutching at his victims, who are of all ages and occupations,\r\nfrom the lovely young bride at the altar to the hard-working pedlar in the\r\ncut we give here, and all of them are hurried away by this frightful\r\nfigure which stands for Death itself.\r\n\r\nHolbein made many wood engravings, but none so important as these. When\r\nthe set is complete there are fifty-three cuts, but it is rare to find\r\nmore than forty-six.\r\n\r\nHolbein was one of the foremost of German masters. All his pictures are\r\nrealistic, and many of them are fantastic; he gave graceful movement and\r\nbeauty of form to many of his subjects; his drapery was well arranged; his\r\ncolor and manner of painting were good. He painted in fresco and oil\r\ncolors, executed miniatures and engravings. His portraits were his best\r\nworks, and in them he equalled the greatest masters. The most reliable\r\nportrait of this artist is in the Basle Museum. It is done in red and\r\nblack chalk, and represents him as a man with regular, well-shaped\r\nfeatures, with a cheerful expression which also shows decision of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--FROM HOLBEIN'S DANCE OF DEATH.]\r\n\r\nThere were other good artists in the Augsburg school after the time of the\r\nHolbeins; but I shall pass immediately to the Franconian school, or that\r\nof Nuremburg, and to its great master, ALBERT DÜRER (1471-1528), whose\r\nlife was very interesting, and who stands, as an artist, among the\r\ngreatest painters of the world. The city of Nuremburg was a grand, rich\r\nold place even in Dürer's time, and as a boy he was familiar with its\r\nscenery and architecture, which helped him to cultivate his artist tastes,\r\nand to make him the great man that he became. He was an author of books as\r\nwell as an architect, sculptor, painter, and engraver.\r\n\r\nHis father was a goldsmith, and Albert was apprenticed to the same trade;\r\nbut he was so anxious to study painting that at length his father placed\r\nhim as apprentice to the painter Michael Wohlgemuth. At this time Albert\r\nwas fifteen years old, and the two years he had spent with the goldsmith\r\nhad doubtless been of great advantage to him; for in that time he had been\r\ntrained in the modelling of small, delicate objects, and in the accurate\r\ndesign necessary in making the small articles in precious metals which are\r\nthe principal work of that trade.\r\n\r\nAlbert Dürer had a very strong nature, and Michael Wohlgemuth was not a\r\nman who could gain much influence over such a youth. During the three\r\nyears which Dürer passed under his teaching he learned all the modes of\r\npreparing and using colors, and acquired much skill in handling the brush;\r\nhe also learned the first lessons in wood-engraving, in which he afterward\r\nreached so high a perfection that a large part of his present fame rests\r\nupon his skill in that art.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest portraits painted by Dürer is in the Albertina at\r\nVienna, and bears this inscription: \"This I have drawn from myself from\r\nthe looking-glass, in the year 1484, when I was still a child. ALBERT\r\nDÜRER.\" Six years later he painted the beautiful portrait of his father\r\nwhich is now in the gallery at Florence; and it is a question whether this\r\nis not as finely executed as any portrait of his later years.\r\n\r\nWhen Dürer left Wohlgemuth he started upon the student journey which was\r\nthen the custom with all German youths, and is still practised in a\r\nmodified degree. These youths, after serving their apprenticeship in the\r\noccupation they were to follow, travelled, and worked at their trade or\r\nprofession in the cities of other countries. Dürer was absent four years,\r\nbut we know little of what he did or saw, for in his own account of his\r\nlife he says only this: \"And when the three years were out my father sent\r\nme away. I remained abroad four years, when he recalled me; and, as I had\r\nleft just after Easter in 1490, I returned home in 1494, just after\r\nWhitsuntide.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year, in July, Dürer was married to Agnes Frey. He was also\r\nadmitted to the guild of painters, and we may say that he was now settled\r\nfor life. It is a singular fact that, although Dürer painted several\r\nportraits of his father and himself, he is not known to have made any of\r\nhis wife. Some of his sketches are called by her name, but there is no\r\ngood reason for this.\r\n\r\nDürer was so industrious, and executed so many pictures, copper-plates,\r\nand wood engravings within the six years next after his return to\r\nNuremburg, that it is not possible to give an exact account of them here.\r\nIn 1500 an event occurred which added much to his happiness and to his\r\nopportunities for enlarging his influence. It was the return to Nuremburg\r\nof Willibald Pirkheimer, one of the friends of Dürer's childhood, between\r\nwhom and himself there had always existed a strong affection. Pirkheimer\r\nwas rich and influential, and at his house Dürer saw many eminent men,\r\nartists, scholars, reformers, and theologians, and in their society he\r\ngained much broader knowledge of the world, while he received the respect\r\nwhich was due to his genius and character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--A SCENE FROM DÜRER'S WOOD ENGRAVINGS OF THE LIFE\r\nOF THE VIRGIN MARY.]\r\n\r\nDürer's health was not good, and his continual work proved more than he\r\ncould bear. His father died in 1502, and this loss was a deep grief to the\r\nartist. So little money was left for his mother and younger brother that\r\ntheir support came upon him. At length, in 1505, he made a journey to\r\nVenice, partly for his health, and in order to study Venetian painting. He\r\nwas well received by the painters of Venice. Giovanni Bellini and\r\nCarpaccio were the leading painters of that time. They were both quite\r\nold, but Giorgione and Titian were already coming into notice and\r\npreparing to fill the places of the older men. Bellini was especially\r\ndelighted with the exquisite manner in which Dürer painted hair, and asked\r\nthe German to give him the brush he used for that purpose. Dürer gave him\r\nall his brushes, but Bellini insisted upon having _the one_ for painting\r\nhair. Dürer took a common brush, and painted a long tress of fine hair:\r\nBellini declared that had he not seen this done he could not have believed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhile in Venice Dürer received an order to paint a picture for the Fondaco\r\nde' Tedeschi, or German Exchange. It is believed that this work was the\r\nfamous \"Feast of Rose Garlands,\" now in the Monastery at Strahow, in\r\nBohemia. The Emperor Rudolph II. bought it, and had it carried from Venice\r\nto Prague on men's shoulders. In 1782 it was purchased for the Abbey of\r\nStrahow, and was almost lost to the world for many years. It is a\r\nbeautiful picture, and the praise it received was a great pleasure to\r\nDürer, because heretofore many painters had said that he was a good\r\nengraver, but could not use colors. Dürer wrote to Pirkheimer: \"There is\r\nno better picture of the Virgin Mary in the land, because all the artists\r\npraise it, as well as the nobility. They say they have never seen a more\r\nsublime, a more charming painting.\"\r\n\r\nThe Venetian Government offered Dürer a handsome pension if he would\r\nremain in Venice, and he declined many orders for the sake of returning to\r\nGermany, which he believed to be his duty. From the time of his return, in\r\n1507, to 1520, there is very little to tell of the personal history of\r\nthis artist. Almost all that can be said is that he labored with great\r\nindustry; it was the golden period of his art; he had many young men in\r\nhis studio, which was the centre of art to Nuremburg. At this time he\r\nprobably executed the best carvings which he ever did. During seven years\r\nhe made forty-eight engravings and etchings and more than a hundred\r\nwood-cuts. The large demand for these works was a source of good income to\r\nDürer, and gave him a position of comfort. The Reformation was at hand,\r\nand Dürer's Virgins and Saints and his pictures of the sufferings of\r\nChrist were very well suited to the religious excitement of that period.\r\n\r\nThe house in which Dürer lived and worked for many years is still\r\npreserved in Nuremburg as public property, and is used as an art gallery.\r\nThe street on which it stands is now called the Albrecht-Dürer Strasse. On\r\nthe square before the house stands a bronze statue of the master which was\r\nerected by the Nuremburgers on the three hundredth anniversary of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAbout 1509 Dürer occupied himself considerably in writing poetry; but,\r\nalthough there was much earnest feeling in his verse, it was not such as\r\nto give him great fame as a poet. It was at the same period that he carved\r\nthe wonderful bas-relief of the \"Birth of John the Baptist,\" now in the\r\nBritish Museum. It is cut out of stone, is seven and one-half by five and\r\none-half inches in size, and is a marvellous piece of work. Two thousand\r\nfive hundred dollars were paid for it nearly a century ago. He made many\r\nexquisite little carvings in stone, ivory, and boxwood, and in these\r\narticles the result of his work as a goldsmith is best seen.\r\n\r\nIn 1512 Dürer was first employed by the Emperor Maximilian, and for the\r\nnext seven years there was a close relation between the sovereign and the\r\nartist; but there are few records concerning it. It is said that one day\r\nwhen the painter was making a sketch of the emperor the latter took a\r\ncharcoal crayon, and tried to draw a picture himself: he constantly broke\r\nthe crayon, and made no progress toward his end. After watching him for a\r\ntime Dürer took the charcoal from Maximilian, saying, \"This is my sceptre,\r\nyour Majesty;\" and he then taught the emperor how to use it.\r\n\r\nDürer executed some very remarkable drawings and engravings. Among them\r\nwas the \"Triumphal Arch of Maximilian,\" composed of ninety-two blocks. The\r\nwhole cut is ten and one-half feet high by nine feet wide. It shows all\r\nthe remarkable events in the emperor's life, just as such subjects were\r\ncarved upon the triumphal arches of the Romans and other nations.\r\nHieronymus Rösch did the engraving of this great work from Dürer's blocks,\r\nand while it was in progress the emperor went often to see it. During one\r\nof these visits several cats ran into the room, from which happening arose\r\nthe proverb, \"A cat may look at a king.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor granted Dürer a pension; but it was never regularly paid, and\r\nafter the emperor's death the Council of Nuremburg refused to pay it\r\nunless it was confirmed by the new sovereign, Charles V. For the purpose\r\nof obtaining this confirmation Dürer made a journey to the Netherlands in\r\nthe year 1520. His wife and her maid Susanna went with him. His diary\r\ngives a quaint account of the places they visited, the people whom they\r\nmet, and of the honors which were paid him. In Antwerp he was received\r\nwith great kindness, and the government of the city offered him a house\r\nand a liberal pension if he would remain there; but his love for his\r\nnative town would not allow him to leave it.\r\n\r\nAfter several months Dürer received the confirmation of his pension and\r\nalso the appointment of court-painter. This last office was of very little\r\naccount to him. The emperor spent little time at Nuremburg, and it was\r\nnot until he was older that he was seized with the passion of having his\r\nportrait painted, and then Dürer had died, and Titian was painter to the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--THE FOUR APOSTLES. _By Dürer._]\r\n\r\nWhen Dürer returned to his home there was quite an excitement over the\r\ncollection of curious and rare objects which he had made while absent.\r\nSome of these he had bought, and many others were gifts to him, and he\r\ngave much pleasure to his friends by displaying them. There had been a\r\ngreat change in Nuremburg, for the doctrines of the Reformation were\r\naccepted by many of its people, and it was the first free city that\r\ndeclared itself Protestant. The change, too, was quietly made; its\r\nconvents and churches were saved from violence, and the art treasures of\r\nthe city were not destroyed. Among the most important Lutherans was\r\nPirkheimer, Dürer's friend. We do not know that Dürer became a Lutheran,\r\nbut he wrote of his admiration for the great reformer in his diary, and it\r\nis a meaning fact that during the last six years of his life Dürer made no\r\nmore pictures of the Madonna.\r\n\r\nThese last years were not as full of work as the earlier ones had been. A\r\nfew portraits and engravings and the pictures of the Four Apostles were\r\nabout all the works of this time. He gave much attention to the\r\narrangement and publication of his writings upon various subjects\r\nconnected with the arts. These books gave him much fame as a scholar, and\r\nsome of them were translated into several languages.\r\n\r\nAs an architect Dürer executed but little work; but his writings upon\r\narchitectural subjects prove that he was learned in its theories.\r\n\r\nDuring several years his health was feeble, and he exerted himself to make\r\nprovision for his old age if he should live, or for his wife after his\r\ndeath. He was saddened by the thought that he had never been rewarded as\r\nhe should have been for his hard, faithful labors, and his latest letters\r\nwere sad and touching. He died in April, 1528, after a brief illness, and\r\nwas buried in the cemetery of St. John, beyond the walls, where a simple\r\nepitaph was inscribed upon his monument. This cemetery is an interesting\r\nplace, and contains the graves of many men noted in the chronicles of\r\nNuremburg.\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday in 1828, three hundred years after his death, a Dürer\r\ncelebration was held in Nuremburg. Artists came from all parts of Germany.\r\nA solemn procession proceeded to his grave, where hymns were sung, and the\r\nstatue by Rauch, near Dürer's house, was dedicated.\r\n\r\nI can give you no description of Dürer's many works, and although it is\r\ntrue that he was a very great master, yet it is also true that his\r\npictures and engravings are not noted for their beauty so much as for\r\ntheir strength and power. His subjects were often ugly and repulsive\r\nrather than beautiful, and his imagination was full of weird, strange\r\nfancies that can scarcely be understood. Indeed, some of them never have\r\nbeen explained, and one of his most famous engravings, called \"The Knight,\r\nDeath, and the Devil,\" has never yet been satisfactorily interpreted, and\r\nmany different theories have been made about it.\r\n\r\nMany of the principal galleries of Europe have Dürer's paintings, though\r\nthey are not as numerous as his engravings, and, indeed, his fame rests\r\nmore upon the latter than the former, and very large sums are paid by\r\ncollectors for good impressions of his more important plates.\r\n\r\nDürer had several followers. His most gifted scholar was LUCAS SUNDER\r\n(1472-1553), who is called Lucas Cranach, from the place of his birth. He\r\nestablished a school of painting in Saxony, and was appointed\r\ncourt-painter. Although there were a goodly number of German painters late\r\nin the sixteenth century, there were none of great eminence, and, in\r\ntruth, there have been few since that time whose lives were of sufficient\r\ninterest to be recounted here, so I shall tell you of but one more before\r\npassing to the artists of Spain.\r\n\r\nANGELICA KAUFFMAN (1742-1808) was a very interesting woman who gained a\r\ngood reputation as an artist; but there is such a difference of opinion\r\namong judges as to her merits as a painter that it is difficult to decide\r\nwhat to say of her. As a person, she excited an interest in her lifetime\r\nwhich has never died out, and Miss Thackeray's novel, \"Miss Angel,\" tells\r\nwhat is claimed to be her story, as nearly as such stories are told in\r\nnovels.\r\n\r\nShe was born at Coire, in the Grisons. Her father was an artist, a native\r\nof Schwarzenburg, and when Angelica was born he was occupied in executing\r\nsome frescoes at Coire. When the child was a year old he settled at\r\nMorbegno, in Lombardy, and ten years later, when she had shown a taste for\r\nmusic, her parents again removed to Como, where there were better\r\nopportunities for her instruction. Her progress in music was remarkable,\r\nand for a time she was unable to say whether she loved this art or that of\r\npainting the better. Later in life she painted a picture in which she\r\nrepresented herself, as a child, standing between allegorical figures of\r\nMusic and Painting.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful scenery about Como, the stately palaces and charming villas,\r\nthe lake with its pleasure boats, and all the poetry of the life there,\r\ntended to develop her talents rapidly, and, though she remained but two\r\nyears, the recollection of this time was a pleasure to her through all her\r\nlife. She was next taken to Milan, where a world of art was opened to her,\r\nand she saw pictures which excelled all her imaginations. The works of\r\nLeonardo and other great Lombard masters stirred her soul to its very\r\ndepths. She soon attracted attention by her pictures, and Robert d'Este\r\nbecame her patron, and placed her under the care of the Duchess of\r\nCarrara. She was now daily associated with people of culture and elegance,\r\nand thus early in her life acquired the modest dignity and\r\nself-possession which enabled her in her future life to accept becomingly\r\nthe honors and attentions which were paid her.\r\n\r\nHer mother's death occurred at Milan, and her father returned to\r\nSchwarzenburg. The people about her were so coarse and disagreeable to\r\nAngelica that she passed much of her time in the grand forests. At this\r\ntime she painted frescoes of the Twelve Apostles, copied from the\r\nengravings after Piazetta. Her father was not content to remain away from\r\nItaly, and they went again to Milan, then to Florence, and at last to\r\nRome. She was now eighteen years old, and found much profit in the\r\nfriendship of the great scholar Winckelmann, who allowed her to paint his\r\nportrait. Angelica visited Naples and Bologna also, and finally Venice,\r\nwhere she met Lady Wentworth, who became her friend, and afterward took\r\nher to England.\r\n\r\nShe had a most brilliant career in London, where her friends were in the\r\nhighest rank of society. De Rossi described her appearance at this time,\r\nand said that she was not very tall, but had a slight, elegant figure. Her\r\ncomplexion was dark and clear, her mouth well formed, her teeth white and\r\neven, and all her features good. He speaks of her azure eyes, so placid\r\nand bright that their expression had a charm which could not be described.\r\nNo one felt like criticising her. Other artists paid her many honors, and\r\nshe was made a member of the Academy of Arts. It has been said that\r\nFuseli, the learned art critic, and Sir Joshua Reynolds, the great artist,\r\nboth asked her hand in marriage. Some members of the royal family became\r\nher friends, and she was at the height of honorable success and of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to turn from this bright picture of her life to all the\r\nsorrow and darkness which followed it. She made an unhappy marriage, her\r\nhusband proving to be an adventurer who had assumed a distinguished name.\r\nFor a time she was crushed by this sorrow; but her friends remained true\r\nto her, and she found relief in absolute devotion to her art. For twelve\r\nyears she supported herself and her father; then his health failed, and it\r\nwas thought best for him to go to Italy. Angelica was now forty years old,\r\nand before leaving England she married Antonio Zucchi, an artist who had\r\nlong been her friend. He devoted himself to her and to her father with\r\nuntiring affection, and when the old man died he was happy in the thought\r\nthat his beloved daughter had so true a friend as Zucchi.\r\n\r\nFrom this time their home was in Rome, where Angelica was the centre of an\r\nartistic and literary society of a high order. Among her visitors were\r\nsuch men as Herder and Goethe. The latter wrote of her: \"The light and\r\npleasing in form and color, in design and execution, distinguish the\r\nnumerous works of our artist. No living painter excels her in dignity or\r\nin the delicate taste with which she handles the pencil.\" She was very\r\nindustrious, and her life seems to have been divided between two\r\npleasures, her work and the society of her friends, until the death of her\r\nhusband, which occurred in 1795. She lived twelve years longer, but they\r\nwere years of great sadness. She made journeys in order to regain her\r\nspirits. She visited the scenes of her childhood, and remained some time\r\nin Venice with the family of Signor Zucchi.\r\n\r\nEven after her last return to Rome she worked as much as her strength\r\nwould permit, but her life was not long. She was mourned sincerely in\r\nRome; her funeral was attended by the members of the Academy of St. Luke;\r\nand her latest works were borne in the procession. She was buried beside\r\nher husband in the Church of St. Andrea dei Frati. Her bust was placed in\r\nthe Pantheon.\r\n\r\nVarious critics have praised her works in the most liberal manner; others\r\ncan say nothing good of them. For myself, I cannot find the extreme of\r\npraise or blame a just estimate of her. No one can deny the grace of her\r\ndesign, which was also creditably correct. Her portraits were good; her\r\npoetical subjects are very pleasing; her historical pictures are not\r\nstrong; her color was as harmonious and mellow as that of the best\r\nItalians, excepting a few of the greatest masters, and in all her pictures\r\nthere is something which wins for her a certain fondness and praise, even\r\nwhile her faults are plainly seen. Her pictures are to be found in\r\ngalleries in Rome, Florence, Vienna, Munich, and England; many are also in\r\nprivate collections. She painted several portraits of herself; one in the\r\nUffizi, at Florence, is very pleasing. She represents herself seated in a\r\nsolitary landscape, with a portfolio in one hand and a pencil in the\r\nother. She has an air of perfect unconsciousness, as if she thought of her\r\nwork only. Her etchings are much valued, and sell for large prices. Many\r\nof her pictures were engraved by Bartolozzi, and good prints of them are\r\nrare. On one of her pictures she wrote: \"I will not attempt to express\r\nsupernatural things by human inspiration, but wait for that till I reach\r\nheaven, if there is painting done there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN SPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanish painting had its birth during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,\r\nand may be said to have been derived from Italy, through the influence of\r\nthe Italian painters who went to Spain, and the Spanish artists who made\r\ntheir studies in Italy. But in spite of this strong Italian influence\r\nSpanish painting has its own characteristics which separate it from all\r\nother schools, and give it a high position on its own merits. ANTONIO DEL\r\nRINCON (1446-1500) was the first Spanish painter of whom we know. If any\r\nworks of his remain they are portraits of his august sovereigns now in the\r\nCathedral of Granada; but it is probable that these pictures are copies of\r\nthe originals by Rincon.\r\n\r\nDating the beginning of the Spanish school from the last half of the\r\nfifteenth century, it is the third school in Europe as to age, it being\r\nabout two centuries later than the Italian, and one century later than the\r\nFlemish school. Its importance is only exceeded by that of Italy. The\r\ndistinguishing feature of Spanish art is its gravity, or we may almost say\r\nits strictly religious character, for, excepting portraits, there were few\r\npictures of consequence that had not a religious meaning. Some artists\r\nwere also priests, and, as the officers of the Inquisition appointed\r\ninspectors whose duty it was to report for punishment any artist who did\r\nnot follow the rules of the Inquisition, it is easy to understand that the\r\npainters were careful to keep within the rules fixed for them. Whatever\r\nflights of imagination one might have in secret, he would scarcely run the\r\nrisk of being excommunicated from the church, sent into exile for a year,\r\nand fined one thousand five hundred ducats for the pleasure of putting his\r\nfancies on canvas.\r\n\r\nPacheco, who was an inspector at Seville, published minute rules for the\r\nrepresentation of sacred subjects and persons, and other writers did the\r\nsame. There was a long and grave discussion over the propriety of painting\r\nthe devil with horns and a tail. It was decided that he should have horns\r\nbecause, according to the legend of St. Theresa, he had horns when he\r\nappeared to that saint; and he was allowed to have a tail because it was\r\nthought to be a suitable appendage to a fallen angel who had lost his\r\nwings. One very strict rule was that the feet of the Virgin Mary should be\r\ncovered, and nude figures or portions of the figure were strictly\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nAnother important influence upon the Spanish artists was their belief that\r\nthe Virgin Mary and other holy spirits appeared to inspire them and aid\r\nthem in painting their pictures. In fact, the church was the chief patron\r\nof art, and the artist was one of her most valuable teachers. A learned\r\nSpanish writer said: \"For the ignorant, what master is like painting? They\r\nmay read their duty in a picture though they may not search for it in\r\nbooks.\"\r\n\r\nThe painters of Spain were divided between the schools of Castile,\r\nSeville, and Valencia. That of Castile was founded at Toledo early in the\r\nfifteenth century, and was maintained about two hundred years. Claudio\r\nCoello was of this school; he died in 1693, and has well been called \"the\r\nlast of the old masters of Spain.\"\r\n\r\nALONZO BERREGUETTE (1480-1561), born at Parades de Nava, in Castile, was\r\nthe most eminent Spanish artist of his time. He is called the Michael\r\nAngelo of Spain, because he was painter, sculptor, and architect. He was\r\npainter to Philip I. Later he went to Italy, and journeyed from Florence\r\nto Rome with Michael Angelo in 1505. He studied in Italy many years. He\r\nwas appointed painter and sculptor to the Emperor Charles V. Berreguette\r\nreceived four thousand four hundred ducats for the altar in the Church of\r\nSt. Benito el Real in Valladolid, where he settled. When he was almost\r\neighty years old he went to Toledo to erect a monument in the Hospital of\r\nSt. John Baptist. He was lodged in the hospital, and died there. He left a\r\nlarge fortune, and was buried with splendid ceremonies at the expense of\r\nthe emperor.\r\n\r\nLUIS DE MORALES (1510-1586) was called \"the divine.\" He belonged to the\r\nschool of Castile, and very little is known of his early life. When he was\r\nfifty-five years old Philip II. invited him to court. When Morales\r\nappeared he was so splendidly dressed that the king was angry, and gave\r\norders that he should be paid a certain sum and dismissed. But the poor\r\npainter explained that he had spent all that he had in order to come\r\nbefore the king in a dress befitting Philip's dignity. Then Philip\r\npardoned him, and allowed him to paint one picture; but as this was not\r\nhung in the Escorial, Morales was overcome by mortification, and almost\r\nforsook his painting, and fell into great poverty. In 1581 the king saw\r\nMorales at Badajoz, in a very different dress from that he had worn at\r\ncourt. The king said: \"Morales, you are very old.\" \"Yes, sire, and very\r\npoor,\" replied the painter. The king then commanded that he should have\r\ntwo hundred ducats a year from the crown rents with which to buy his\r\ndinners. Morales hearing this, exclaimed, \"And for supper, sire?\" This\r\npleased Philip, and he added one hundred ducats to the pension. The street\r\nin Badajoz on which Morales lived bears his name.\r\n\r\nNearly all his pictures were of religious subjects, and on this account he\r\nwas called \"the divine.\" He avoided ghastly, painful pictures, and was one\r\nof the most spiritual of the artists of Spain. Very few of his pictures\r\nare seen out of Spain, and they are rare even there. His masterpiece is\r\n\"Christ Crowned with Thorns,\" in the Queen of Spain's Gallery at Madrid.\r\nIn the Louvre is his \"Christ Bearing the Cross.\" At the sale of the Soult\r\ncollection his \"Way to Calvary\" sold for nine hundred and eighty pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nALONSO SANCHEZ COELLO (about 1515-1590) was the first great portrait\r\npainter of Spain. He was painter-in-ordinary to Philip II., and that\r\nmonarch was so fond of him that in his letters he called him \"my beloved\r\nson.\" At Madrid the king had a key to a private entrance to the apartments\r\nof Coello, so that he could surprise the painter in his studio, and at\r\ntimes even entered the family rooms of the artist. Coello never abused the\r\nconfidence of Philip, and was a favorite of the court as well as of the\r\nmonarch. Among his friends were the Popes Gregory XIII. and Sixtus V., the\r\nCardinal Alexander Farnese, and the Dukes of Florence and Savoy. Many\r\nnoble and even royal persons were accustomed to visit him and accept his\r\nhospitality. He was obliged to live in style becoming his position, and\r\nyet when he died he left a fortune of fifty-five thousand ducats. He had\r\nlived in Lisbon, and Philip sometimes called him his \"Portuguese Titian.\"\r\n\r\nVery few of his portraits remain; they are graceful in pose and fine in\r\ncolor. He knew how to represent the repose and refinement of \"gentle blood\r\nand delicate nurture.\" Many of his works were burned in the Prado. His\r\n\"Marriage of St. Catherine\" is in the Gallery of Madrid. A \"St. Sebastian\"\r\npainted for the Church of St. Jerome, at Madrid, is considered his\r\nmasterpiece. Lope de Vega wrote Coello's epitaph, and called his pictures\r\n\r\n      \"Eternal scenes of history divine,\r\n       Wherein for aye his memory shall shine.\"\r\n\r\nJUAN FERNANDEZ NAVARRETE (1526-1579), called El Mudo, because deaf and\r\ndumb, is a very interesting painter. He was not born a mute, but became\r\ndeaf at three years of age, and could not learn to speak. He studied some\r\nyears in Italy, and was in the school of Titian. In 1568 he was appointed\r\npainter to Philip II. His principal works were eight pictures for the\r\nEscorial, three of which were burned. His picture of the \"Nativity\" is\r\ncelebrated for its lights, of which there are three; one is from the\r\nDivine Babe, a second from the glory above, and a third from a torch in\r\nthe hand of St. Joseph. The group of shepherds is the best part of the\r\npicture, and when Tibaldi saw the picture he exclaimed, \"O! gli belli\r\npastori!\" and it has since been known as the \"Beautiful Shepherds.\"\r\n\r\nHis picture of \"Abraham and the Three Angels\" was placed near the door\r\nwhere the monks of the Escorial received strangers. The pictures of\r\nNavarrete are rare. After his death Lope de Vega wrote a lament for him,\r\nin which he said,\r\n\r\n      \"No countenance he painted that was dumb.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Last Supper\" painted by Titian reached the Escorial, it was\r\nfound to be too large for the space it was to occupy in the refectory. The\r\nking ordered it to be cut, which so distressed El Mudo that he offered to\r\ncopy it in six months, in reduced size, and to forfeit his head if he did\r\nnot fulfil his promise. He also added that he should hope to be knighted\r\nif he copied in six months what Titian had taken seven years to paint. But\r\nPhilip was resolute, and the picture was cut, to the intense grief of the\r\ndumb Navarrete. While the painter lived Philip did not fully appreciate\r\nhim; but after his death the king often declared that his Italian artists\r\ncould not equal his mute Spaniard.\r\n\r\nJUAN CARREÑO DE MIRANDA (1614-1685) is commonly called Carreño. He was of\r\nan ancient noble family. His earliest works were for the churches and\r\nconvents of Madrid, and he acquired so good a name that before the death\r\nof Philip IV. he was appointed one of his court-painters. In 1671 the\r\nyoung king Charles gave Carreño the cross of Santiago, and to his office\r\nof court-painter added that of Deputy Aposentador. He would allow no other\r\nartist to paint his likeness unless Carreño consented to it. The pictures\r\nof Carreño were most excellent, and his character was such as to merit all\r\nhis good fortune. His death was sincerely mourned by all who knew him.\r\n\r\nIt is said that on one occasion he was in a house where a copy of Titian's\r\n\"St. Margaret\" hung upon the wall, and those present united in saying that\r\nit was abominably done. Carreño said: \"It has at least one merit; it shows\r\nthat no one need despair of improving in art, for I painted it myself when\r\nI was a beginner.\"\r\n\r\nGregorio Utande, a poor artist, had painted a \"Martyrdom of St. Andrew\"\r\nfor the nuns of Alcalà, and demanded one hundred ducats for it. The nuns\r\nthought the price too much, and wished to have Carreño value the work.\r\nUtande took the picture to Carreño, and first presenting the great master\r\nwith a jar of honey, asked him to touch up his St. Andrew for him. Carreño\r\nconsented, and, in fact, almost repainted Utande's picture. A short time\r\nafter Carreño was asked to value the St. Andrew, but declined. Then\r\nHerrera valued it at two hundred ducats, which price the nuns paid. After\r\nUtande received his money he told the whole story, and the picture was\r\nthen known as \"La Cantarilla de Miel,\" or \"the pot of honey.\"\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO COELLO (1635-1693), who, as we have said, has been called the last\r\nof the old Spanish masters, was intended by his father for his own\r\nprofession, that of bronze-casting. But Claudio persuaded his father to\r\nallow him to study painting, and before the close of his life he became\r\nthe most famous painter in Madrid. He was not only the court-painter, but\r\nalso the painter to the Cathedral of Toledo and keeper of the royal\r\ngalleries. It was not strange that he should feel that he merited the\r\nhonor of painting the walls of the Escorial, and when this was refused him\r\nand Luca Giordano was selected for the work, Coello threw aside his\r\nbrushes and paints, grew sad, then ill, and died a year later. His\r\nmasterpiece is now in the Escorial; it represents the \"Collocation of the\r\nHost.\" His own portrait painted by himself is in the gallery of the\r\nHermitage at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe school of Seville was the most important school of Spain. It is also\r\nknown as the school of Andalusia. It dates from the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century, and its latest master, Alonso Miguel de Tobar, died in\r\n1758.\r\n\r\nLUIS DE VARGAS (1502-1568), one of the earliest of the painters of the\r\nschool of Seville, was a devout and holy man. He was accustomed to do\r\npenance, and in his room after his death scourges were found with which he\r\nhad beaten himself, and a coffin in which he had been accustomed to lie\r\nand meditate upon death and a future life. It is said that Vargas studied\r\ntwenty-eight years in Italy. His pictures were fine. His female heads were\r\ngraceful and pure, his color good, and the whole effect that of grand\r\nsimplicity. His picture of the \"Temporal Generation of Our Lord\" is his\r\nbest work in Seville. Adam is kneeling in the foreground, and his leg is\r\nso well painted that the picture has been called \"La Gamba.\" In spite of\r\nhis seriousness Vargas was a witty man. On one occasion he was asked to\r\ngive his opinion of a very poor picture of \"Christ on the Cross.\" Vargas\r\nreplied: \"He looks as if he were saying, 'Forgive them, Lord, for they\r\nknow not what they do!'\"\r\n\r\nPABLO DE CESPEDES (1538-1608) was born at Cordova, and is an important\r\nperson in the history of his time, for he was a divine, a poet, and a\r\nscholar, as well as an architect, sculptor, and painter. He was a graduate\r\nof the University of Alcalà, and excelled in Oriental languages. He\r\nstudied art in Rome, and while there made a head of Seneca in marble, and\r\nfitted it to an antique trunk; on account of this work he was called\r\n\"Victor il Spagnuolo.\" Zuccaro was asked to paint a picture for the\r\nsplendid Cathedral of Cordova; he declined, and said that while Cespedes\r\nwas in Spain they had no need of Italian artists. The pictures of Cespedes\r\nwhich now remain are so faded and injured that a good judgment can\r\nscarcely be formed of them; but they do not seem to be as fine as they\r\nwere thought to be in his day. His \"Last Supper\" is in the Cathedral of\r\nCordova. In the foreground there are some jars and vases so well painted\r\nthat visitors praised them. Cespedes was so mortified at this that he\r\ncommanded his servant to rub them out, and only the most judicious\r\nadmiration for the rest of the picture and earnest entreaty for the\r\npreservation of the jars saved them from destruction. He left many\r\nwritings upon artistic subjects and an essay upon the antiquity of the\r\nCathedral of Cordova. He was as modest as he was learned, and was much\r\nbeloved. He was made a canon in the Cathedral of Cordova, and was received\r\nwith \"full approbation of the Cordovese bishop and chapter.\"\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO PACHECO (1571-1654) was born at Seville. He was a writer on art,\r\nand is more famous as the master of Velasquez and on account of his books\r\nthan for his pictures. He established a school where younger men than\r\nhimself could have a thorough art education. Pacheco was the first in\r\nSpain to properly gild and paint statues and bas-reliefs. Some specimens\r\nof his work in this specialty still exist in Seville.\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO DE HERRERA, the elder (1576-1656), was a very original painter.\r\nHe was born at Seville, and never studied out of Andalusia. He had so bad\r\na temper that he drove his children and his pupils away from him. He knew\r\nhow to engrave on bronze, and made false coins; when his forgery was\r\ndiscovered, he took refuge with the Jesuits. While in their convent\r\nHerrera painted the history of St. Hermengild, one of the patron saints of\r\nSeville. When Philip IV. saw his picture he forgave him his crime, and set\r\nhim at liberty.\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO ZURBARAN (1598-1662) was one of the first among Spanish\r\npainters. He was skilful in the use of colors, and knew how to use sober\r\ntints and give them a brilliant effect. He did not often paint the\r\nMadonna. His female saints are like portraits of the ladies of his day. He\r\nwas very successful in painting animals, and his pictures of drapery and\r\nstill-life were exact in their representation of the objects he used for\r\nmodels. He painted historical and religious pictures, portraits and\r\nanimals; but his best pictures were of monks. Stirling says: \"He studied\r\nthe Spanish friar, and painted him with as high a relish as Titian painted\r\nthe Venetian noble, and Vandyck the gentleman of England.\"\r\n\r\nZurbaran was appointed painter to Philip IV. before he was thirty-five\r\nyears old. He was a great favorite with Philip, who once called Zurbaran\r\n\"the painter of the king, and king of painters.\" Zurbaran's finest works\r\nare in the Museum of Seville. He left many pictures, and the Louvre claims\r\nto have ninety-two of them in its gallery.\r\n\r\nDIEGO RODRIGUEZ DE SILVA Y VELASQUEZ (1599-1660) was born at Seville, and\r\ndied at Madrid. His parents were of noble families; his father was Juan\r\nRodriguez de Silva, and his mother Geronima Velasquez, by whose name,\r\naccording to the custom of Andalusia, he was called. His paternal\r\ngrandfather was a Portuguese, but so poor that he was compelled to leave\r\nhis own country, and seek his fortune at Seville, and to this circumstance\r\nSpain owes her greatest painter. Velasquez's father became a lawyer, and\r\nlived in comfort, and his mother devoted herself to his education. The\r\nchild's great love of drawing induced his father to place young Velasquez\r\nin the school of Herrera, where the pupil acquired something of his free,\r\nbold style. But Velasquez soon became weary, and entered the school of\r\nFrancisco Pacheco, an inferior painter, but a learned and polished\r\ngentleman. Here Velasquez soon learned that untiring industry and the\r\nstudy of nature were the surest guides to perfection for an artist. Until\r\n1622 he painted pictures from careful studies of common life, and always\r\nwith the model or subject before him--adhering strictly to form, color,\r\nand outline. He is said to have kept a peasant lad for a study, and from\r\nhim executed a variety of heads in every posture and with every possible\r\nexpression. This gave him wonderful skill in taking likenesses. To this\r\nperiod belong the \"Water Carrier of Seville,\" now at Apsley House, several\r\npictures of beggars, and the \"Adoration of the Shepherds,\" now in the\r\nLouvre, where is also a \"Beggar Boy munching a piece of Pastry.\" At Vienna\r\nis a \"Laughing Peasant\" holding a flower (Fig. 64), and in Munich another\r\n\"Beggar Boy.\" In 1622 his strong desire to see the paintings in the Royal\r\nGalleries led him to Madrid. Letters which he carried gave him admission\r\nto the works of art; but excepting securing the friendship of Fonesca, a\r\nnoted patron of art, and an order to paint a portrait of the poet Gongora,\r\nhe was unnoticed, and so he returned in a few months to Seville.\r\nSubsequently Fonesca interested the minister Olivarez in his behalf. This\r\nresulted in a letter summoning Velasquez to court, with an enclosure of\r\nfifty ducats for the journey. He was attended by his slave, Juan Pareja, a\r\nmulatto lad, who was his faithful attendant for many years, and who became\r\nan excellent painter. His former instructor, Pacheco, now his\r\nfather-in-law, also accompanied him. His first work at the capital,\r\nnaturally, was a portrait of his friend Fonesca, which so pleased the\r\nking, Philip IV., that he appointed Velasquez to his service, in which\r\nhe remained during his life. This gave him full opportunity to perfect\r\nhimself, for the king was never weary of multiplying pictures of himself.\r\nVelasquez also painted many portraits of the other members of the royal\r\nfamily, in groups and singly. His life was even and prosperous, and he\r\nmade steady advances toward perfection. He was sent to Italy to study and\r\nto visit the galleries and works in all the cities. A second time the king\r\nsent him to Italy to purchase works of art, with orders to buy anything he\r\nthought worth having. He was everywhere received with consideration and\r\nkindness. The pope sat to him for his portrait; the cardinals Barberini\r\nand Rospigliosi; the sculptors Bernini and Algardi; the painters Nicolas\r\nPoussin, Pietro da Cortona, Claude and Matteo Prete were his friends and\r\nassociates. Upon his return to Madrid, Velasquez was appointed\r\naposentador-major, with a yearly salary of three thousand ducats, and a\r\nkey at his girdle to unlock every door in the palace. He superintended the\r\nceremonies and festivals of the royal household; he arranged in the halls\r\nof the Alcazar the bronzes and marbles purchased in Italy; he also cast in\r\nbronze the models he brought from abroad, and he yet found time to paint\r\nhis last great picture, \"Las Meniñas,\" or the \"Maids of Honor,\" which\r\nrepresents the royal family, with the artist, maids of honor, the dwarfs,\r\nand a sleeping hound. It is said that when the king saw the picture he\r\ndeclared but one thing was wanting, and with his own hand significantly\r\npainted the cross of Santiago upon the breast of the artist. When the\r\ncourts of France and Spain met on the Isle of Pheasants for the betrothal\r\nof the Infanta Maria Teresa to Louis XIV., Velasquez superintended all the\r\nceremonies and all the festivities. These were of surpassing splendor, for\r\nthese two courts were at this time the most luxurious in Europe. Stirling\r\nsays the fatigues of the life of Velasquez shortened his days. He arrived\r\nat Madrid on his return, on June 26th, and from that time was gradually\r\nsinking. He died August 6th. He was buried with magnificent ceremonies in\r\nthe Church of San Juan. His wife survived him but eight days; she was\r\nburied in the same grave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--LAUGHING PEASANT. _Velasquez._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--THE TOPERS. _By Velasquez._]\r\n\r\nThe character of Velasquez was a rare combination of freedom from\r\njealousy, power to conciliate, sweetness of temper, strength of will and\r\nintellect, and steadfastness of purpose. He was the friend of Rubens and\r\nof Ribera, the protector of Cano and Murillo, who succeeded and were, next\r\nto him, the greatest painters of Spain. As the favorite of Philip IV., in\r\nfact, his minister for artistic affairs, he filled his office with purity\r\nand disinterestedness.\r\n\r\nJUAN DE PAREJA (1610-1670) was born in Spanish South America. He was never\r\na great artist; but the circumstances of his life make him interesting. He\r\nwas the slave of Velasquez, and was employed as color-grinder. He studied\r\npainting secretly, and at last, on an occasion when the king visited the\r\nstudio of his master, Pareja showed him a picture of his own painting, and\r\nthrowing himself at Philip's feet begged pardon for his audacity. Both\r\nPhilip and Velasquez treated him very kindly. Velasquez gave Pareja his\r\nfreedom; but it is said that he continued to serve his old master\r\nfaithfully as long as he lived. Pareja succeeded best as a portrait\r\npainter. His works are not numerous, and are seen in few collections out\r\nof Spain.\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMÉ ESTÉBAN MURILLO (1618-1682) was born at Seville. His parents\r\nwere Gaspar Estéban and Maria Perez, and the name of his maternal\r\ngrandmother, Elvira Murillo, was added to his own, according to Andalusian\r\ncustom. From childhood he showed his inclination for art, and although\r\nthis at first suggested to his parents that he should be educated as a\r\npriest, the idea was soon abandoned, as it was found that his interest in\r\nthe paintings which adorned the churches was artistic rather than\r\nreligious. He was therefore, at an early age, placed in the studio of his\r\nmaternal uncle, Juan de Castillo, one of the leaders of the school of art\r\nof Seville. Castillo was then about fifty years old, and had as a student\r\nwith Louis Fernandez acquired the Florentine style of the sixteenth\r\ncentury--combining chaste designing with cold and hard coloring. Murillo\r\nwas thus early instructed not only in grinding colors and in indispensable\r\nmechanical details, but was thoroughly grounded in the important elements\r\nof purity of conception and dignity of treatment and arrangement. Seville\r\nat this time was the richest city in the Spanish empire. Its commerce with\r\nall Europe, and especially with Spanish America, was at its height. The\r\nGuadalquivir was alive with its shipping. Its palaces of semi-Moorish\r\norigin were occupied by a wealthy and luxurious nobility. The vast\r\ncathedral had been finished a century before. The tower \"La Giralda,\"\r\nthree hundred and forty feet in height, is to this day one of the greatest\r\nmarvels in Christendom, and with its Saracenic ornament and its \"lace work\r\nin stone\" is beyond all compare. The royal palace of the Alcazar, designed\r\nby Moorish architects, rivalled the Alhambra, and was filled with the\r\nfinest workmanship of Grenada. There were one hundred and forty churches,\r\nof which many had been mosques, and were laden with the exquisite\r\nornaments of their original builders. Such a city was sure to stimulate\r\nartists and be their home. The poorer ones were in the habit of exposing\r\ntheir works on balconies, on the steps of churches or the cathedral, or in\r\nany place where they would attract attention. Thus it often happened on\r\nfestival days that a good work would command fame for an artist, and gain\r\nfor him the patronage of some cathedral chapter or generous nobleman.\r\nCastillo removed to Cadiz in 1640, and Murillo, who was very poor, could\r\nonly bring himself before the public, and earn sufficient for the bare\r\nnecessities of life by thus exposing his pictures in the market of the\r\nFeria, as it was called, in front of the Church of All Saints. He\r\nstruggled along in this way for two years. Early in 1640, Murillo met with\r\nan old fellow-pupil, Moya, who had been campaigning in Flanders in the\r\nSpanish army, and had there become impressed with the worth of the clear\r\nand strong style of the Flemish masters. Especially was he pleased with\r\nVandyck, so that he followed him to England, and there studied as his\r\npupil during the last six months of Vandyck's life. Moved by Moya's\r\nromancing stories of travel, adventure, and study, Murillo resolved to see\r\nbetter pictures than were to be found at Seville, and, if possible, to\r\nvisit Italy. As a first step he painted a quantity of banners, madonnas,\r\nflower-pieces--anything and everything--and sold them to a ship owner, who\r\nsent them to Spanish America; and it is said that this and similar trades\r\noriginated the story that Murillo once visited Mexico and other\r\nSpanish-American countries. Thus equipped with funds, and without\r\ninforming his friends (his parents were dead), he started on foot across\r\nthe mountains and the equally dreaded plains for Madrid, which he entered\r\nat the age of twenty-five, friendless and poor. He sought out Velasquez,\r\nand asked him for letters to his friends in Rome. But Velasquez, then at\r\nthe height of his fame and influence, was so much interested in the young\r\nenthusiast that he offered him lodgings and an opportunity to study and\r\ncopy in the galleries of Madrid. The Royal Galleries contained carefully\r\nselected pictures from the Italian and Flemish schools, so that Murillo\r\nwas at once placed in the very best possible conditions for success.\r\nMurillo thus spent more than two years, mostly under the direction of\r\nVelasquez, and worked early and late. He copied from the Italian and\r\nFlemish masters, and drew from casts and from life. This for a time so\r\ninfluenced his style that even now connoisseurs are said to discern\r\nreminiscences of Vandyck and Velasquez in the pictures painted by him on\r\nhis first return to Seville. At the end of two years Velasquez advised\r\nMurillo to go to Rome, and offered to assist him. But Murillo decided\r\nfirst to return to Seville, and perhaps had come to the resolution not to\r\ngo to Italy; but this may be doubted. He knew the progress he had made; he\r\nwas reasonably certain that, if not the superior, he was the equal of any\r\nof the artists he had left behind in Seville. He was sure of the wealth,\r\nand taste, and love for art in his native city. His only sister was living\r\nthere. The rich and noble lady he afterward married resided near there.\r\nAnd so we can hardly wonder that the artist gave up a cherished journey to\r\nItaly, and returned to the scene of his early struggles with poverty.\r\n\r\nThe first works which Murillo painted after his return were for the\r\nFranciscan Convent. They brought him little money but much fame. They were\r\neleven in number, but even the names of some are lost. One represents St.\r\nFrancis resting on his iron bed, listening in ecstacy to the notes of a\r\nviolin which an angel is playing to him; another portrays St. Diego of\r\nAlcalá, asking a blessing on a kettle of broth he is about to give to a\r\ngroup of beggars clustered before him; another represents the death of St.\r\nClara of Assisi, in the rapturous trance in which her soul passed away,\r\nsurrounded by pale nuns and emaciated monks looking upward to a\r\ncontrasting group of Christ and the Madonna, with a train of celestial\r\nvirgins bearing her shining robe of immortality. The companion picture is\r\na Franciscan monk who passes into a celestial ecstacy while cooking in the\r\nconvent kitchen, and who is kneeling in the air, while angels perform his\r\nculinary tasks. These pictures brought Murillo into speedy notice. Artists\r\nand nobles flocked to see them. Orders for portraits and altar-pieces\r\nfollowed in rapid succession, and he was full of work. Notwithstanding the\r\nfact that he was acknowledged to be at the head of his profession in\r\nSeville, his style at this time was cold and hard. It is called _frio_\r\n(cold), to distinguish it from his later styles. The Franciscan Convent\r\npictures were carried off by Marshal Soult, and fortunately; for the\r\nconvent was burned in 1810. His second style, called _calido_, or warm,\r\ndated from about the time of his marriage, in 1648, to a lady of\r\ndistinguished family, named Doña Beatriz de Cabrera y Sotomayor. She was\r\npossessed of considerable property, and had lived in the village of Pilas,\r\na few leagues southwest of Seville. Her portrait is not known to exist;\r\nbut several of Murillo's madonnas which resemble each other are so\r\nevidently portraits, that the belief is these idealized faces were drawn\r\nfrom the countenance of the wife of the master.\r\n\r\nHis home now became famous for its hospitable reunions, and his social\r\nposition, added to his artistic merits, procured for him orders beyond his\r\nutmost ability to fill. One after another in quick succession, large,\r\ngrand works were sent out from his studio to be the pride of churches and\r\nconvents. At this time his pictures were noted for a portrait-like\r\nnaturalness in their faces, perhaps lacking in idealism, but withal pure\r\nand pleasing; the drapery graceful and well arranged, the lights skilfully\r\ndisposed, the tints harmonious, and the contours soft. His flesh tints\r\nwere heightened by dark gray backgrounds, so amazingly true that an\r\nadmirer has said they were painted in blood and milk. The _calido_, or\r\nwarm manner, was preserved for eight or ten years. In this style were\r\npainted an \"Immaculate Conception,\" for the Franciscan Convent; \"The\r\nNativity of the Virgin,\" for the high altar of the Seville Cathedral; a\r\n\"St. Anthony of Padua\" for the same church, and very many others equally\r\nfamous. In 1874 the St. Anthony was stolen from the cathedral, and for\r\nsome time was unheard of, until two men offered to sell it for two hundred\r\nand fifty dollars to Mr. Schaus, the picture dealer in New York. He\r\npurchased the work and turned it over to the Spanish Consul, who\r\nimmediately returned it to the Seville Cathedral, to the great joy of the\r\nSevillians. In 1658 Murillo turned his attention to the founding of an\r\nAcademy of Art, and, though he met with many obstacles, the institution\r\nwas finally opened for instruction in 1660, and Murillo was its first\r\npresident. At this time he was taking on his latest manner, called the\r\n_vaporoso_, or vapory, which was first used in some of his pictures\r\nexecuted for the Church of Sta. Maria la Blanca. In this manner the rigid\r\noutlines of his first style is gone; there is a feathery lightness of\r\ntouch as if the brush had swept the canvas smoothly and with unbroken\r\nevenness: this softness is enhanced by frequent contrasts with harder and\r\nheavier groups in the same picture.\r\n\r\nBut the highest point in the art was reached by Murillo in the eleven\r\npictures which he painted in the Hospital de la Caridad. Six of these are\r\nnow in their original places; five were stolen by Soult and carried to\r\nFrance; some were returned to Spain, but not to the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe convent of the Capuchins at Seville at one time possessed twenty\r\npictures by this master. The larger part of them are now in the Museum of\r\nSeville, and form the finest existing collection of his works. This museum\r\nwas once a church, and the statue of Murillo is placed in front of it.\r\nAlthough the lighting of this museum is far inferior to that of Madrid and\r\nmany others, yet here one must go to realize fully the glory of this\r\nmaster. Among the pictures is the \"Virgen de la Sevilletá,\" or Virgin of\r\nthe Napkin. It is said that the cook of the convent had become the friend\r\nof the painter, and begged of him some memento of his good feeling; the\r\nartist had no canvas, and the cook gave him a napkin upon which this great\r\nwork was done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. _By Murillo. In the\r\nLouvre._]\r\n\r\nMurillo's representation of that extremely spiritual and mystical subject\r\ncalled the Immaculate Conception, has so far excelled that of any other\r\nartist that he has sometimes been called \"the painter of the Conception.\"\r\nHis attention was especially called to this subject by the fact that the\r\ndoctrine it sets forth was a pet with the clergy of Seville, who, when\r\nPope Paul V., in 1617, published a bill making this doctrine obligatory,\r\ncelebrated the occasion with all possible pomp in the churches; the nobles\r\nalso gave entertainments, and the whole city was alive with a fervor of\r\nreligious zeal and a desire to manifest its love for this dogma. The\r\ndirections given by the Inspector of the Holy Office for the\r\nrepresentation of this subject were extremely precise; but Murillo\r\ncomplied with them in general effect only, and disregarded details when it\r\npleased him: for example, the rules prescribed the age of the Virgin to be\r\nfrom twelve to thirteen, and the hair to be of golden hue. Murillo\r\nsometimes pictured her as a dark-haired woman. It is said that when he\r\npainted the Virgin as very young his daughter Francesca was his model;\r\nlater the daughter became a nun in the convent of the Madre de Dios.\r\n\r\nThe few portraits painted by Murillo are above all praise; his pictures of\r\nhumble life, too, would of themselves have sufficed to make him famous. No\r\nSpanish artist, except Velasquez, has painted better landscapes than he.\r\nBut so grand and vast were his religious works that his fame rests\r\nprincipally on them. It is true, however, that in England and in other\r\ncountries out of Spain he was first made famous by his beggar boys and\r\nkindred subjects.\r\n\r\nMurillo and Velasquez may be said to hold equivalent positions in the\r\nannals of Spanish Art--Murillo as the painter for the church, and\r\nVelasquez as that of the court. As a delineator of religious subjects\r\nMurillo ranked only a very little below the greatest Italian masters, and\r\neven beside them he excels in one direction; for he is able more generally\r\nand fully to arouse religious emotions and sympathies. This stamps his\r\ngenius as that of the first order, and it should also be placed to his\r\ncredit, in estimating his native talent, that he never saw anything of all\r\nthe Classic Art which was such a source of inspiration to the artists of\r\nItaly. Stirling says: \"All his ideas were of home growth: his mode of\r\nexpression was purely national and Spanish; his model--nature, as it\r\nexisted in and around Seville.\"\r\n\r\nWhile painting a marriage of St. Catherine for the Capuchin Church of\r\nCadiz, Murillo fell from the scaffold, and soon died from his injuries: he\r\nwas buried in the Church of Sta. Cruz, and it is a sad coincidence that\r\nthis church and that of San Juan, at Madrid, in which Velasquez was\r\ninterred, were both destroyed by the French under the command of Soult.\r\n\r\nThe character of Murillo was such as to command the greatest respect, and\r\nthough he was not associated with as many royal personages as Velasquez,\r\nhe was invited to court, and received many flattering acknowledgments of\r\nhis genius. His fame was not confined to his own country, and his portrait\r\nwas engraved in Flanders during the last year of his life. He had many\r\nstrong personal friends, and his interest in the academy and his\r\ngenerosity to other artists prove him to have been above all mean\r\njealousies: he loved Art because it was Art, and did all in his power for\r\nits elevation in his own country. It is probable that since his death more\r\nmoney has been paid for a single picture by him than he received for the\r\nentire work of his life. The Immaculate Conception, now in the Louvre, was\r\nsold from the Soult collection for six hundred and fifteen thousand three\r\nhundred francs, or more than one hundred and twenty-three thousand\r\ndollars. At the time of its sale it was believed to be the largest price\r\never paid for a picture.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN GOMEZ (about 1620) was a mulatto slave of Murillo's, and like\r\nPareja he secretly learned to paint. At last one day when Murillo left a\r\nsketch of a head of the Virgin on his easel Gomez dared to finish it.\r\nMurillo was glad to find that he had made a painter of his slave, and\r\nthough the pictures of Gomez were full of faults his color was much like\r\nthat of his master. Two of his pictures are in the Museum of Seville. He\r\ndid not live long after Murillo's death in 1682.\r\n\r\nDON ALONSO MIGUEL DE TOBAR (1678-1758) never attained to greatness. His\r\nbest original pictures were portraits. He made a great number of copies of\r\nthe works of Murillo, and was chiefly famous for these pictures. There is\r\nlittle doubt that many pictures attributed to Murillo are _replicas_, or\r\ncopies by the hand of Tobar.\r\n\r\nThe school of Valencia flourished from 1506 to 1680. VICENTE DE JOANES\r\n(about 1506-1579) was a painter of religious pictures who is scarcely\r\nknown out of Spain, and in that country his pictures are, almost without\r\nexception, in churches and convents. He was very devout, and began his\r\nworks with fasting and prayer. It is related that on one occasion a Jesuit\r\nof Valencia had a vision in which the Virgin Mary appeared to him, and\r\ncommanded him to have a picture painted of her in a dress like that she\r\nthen wore, which was a white robe with a blue mantle. She was to be\r\nrepresented standing on a crescent with the mystic dove floating above\r\nher; her Son was to crown her, while the Father was to lean from the\r\nclouds above all.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit selected Joanes to be the painter of this work, and though he\r\nfasted and prayed much he could not paint it so as to please himself or\r\nthe Jesuit. At last his pious zeal overcame all obstacles, and his picture\r\nwas hung above the altar of the Immaculate in the convent of the Jesuits.\r\nIt was very beautiful--the artists praised it, the monks believed that it\r\nhad a miraculous power, and it was known as \"La Purisima,\" or the\r\nperfectly pure one.\r\n\r\nJoanes excelled in his pictures of Christ. He seemed to have conceived the\r\nvery Christ of the Scriptures, the realization of the visions of St. John,\r\nor of the poetry of Solomon. In these pictures he combined majesty with\r\ngrace and love with strength. Joanes frequently represented the Last\r\nSupper, and introduced a cup which is known as the Holy Chalice of\r\nValencia. It is made of agate and adorned with gold and gems, and was\r\nbelieved to have been used by Christ at his Last Supper with his\r\ndisciples. Some of the portraits painted by Joanes are very fine. In\r\nmanner and general effect his works are strangely like those of the great\r\nRaphael.\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO DE RIBALTA (1550-1628) was really the head of the school of\r\nValencia, and one of the best historical painters of Spain. He studied his\r\nart first in Valencia, and there fell in love with the daughter of his\r\nmaster. The father refused him his suit, and the young couple parted in\r\ndeep sorrow. Ribalta went to Italy, where he made such progress, and\r\ngained such fame that when he returned to Valencia he had no trouble in\r\nmarrying his old master's daughter. Valencia has more pictures by Ribalta\r\nthan are found elsewhere. Out of Spain they are very rare. One of his\r\nworks is at Magdalene College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the Spanish painters was that they painted the extremes\r\nof emotion. Their subjects represented the ecstacy of bliss or the most\r\nexcruciating agony. They did not seem to have as much middle ground or to\r\nknow as much of moderate emotions as the painters of other nations.\r\nRibalta was no exception to this rule, and some of his pictures are\r\npainful to look at. His portraits are fine, and represent the most\r\npowerful men of Valencia of the time in which he lived.\r\n\r\nJOSEF DE RIBERA was a native of Valencia, but lived and studied in Italy,\r\nand so became more of an Italian than a Spanish master. I have spoken of\r\nhim in connection with the Naturalists and their school at Naples.\r\n\r\nALONSO CANO (1601-1667) was a very important artist, and cannot be said to\r\nbelong to any school. He was born at Granada, and studied under masters of\r\nSeville, both in painting and sculpture. He became the best Spanish\r\nartist who studied in Spain only. He was something of an architect also,\r\nand his various talents acquired a high place for him among artists; but\r\nhis temper was such as to cause him much trouble, and it so interfered\r\nwith his life that he did not attain to the position to which his artistic\r\ngifts entitled him.\r\n\r\nIn 1637 he fought a duel, and was obliged to flee from Madrid, and in 1644\r\nhis wife was found murdered in her bed. Cano was suspected of the crime,\r\nand although he fled he was found, and brought back, and put to the\r\ntorture. He made no confession, and was set at liberty; but many people\r\nbelieved in his guilt. He still held his office as painter to the king,\r\nand was sometimes employed on important works; but he determined to remove\r\nto his native Granada and become a priest. Philip IV. appointed him canon,\r\nand after he held this office he was still employed as a painter and\r\nsculptor by private persons, as well as by religious bodies, and was even\r\nsent to Malaga to superintend improvements in the cathedral there. But his\r\ntemper led him into so many broils that at length, in 1659, the chapter of\r\nGranada deprived him of his office. He went to the king with his\r\ncomplaints, and was again made a canon; but he was so angry that he never\r\nwould use his brush or his chisel in the service of the Cathedral of\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nHis life was now devoted to charity and good works. He gave away all his\r\nmoney as soon as he received it. When his purse was empty he would go into\r\na shop, and beg a pencil and paper, and sketching a head or other design\r\nwould mark the price on it, and give it to a beggar with directions for\r\nfinding a purchaser for it. After his death large numbers of these charity\r\nworks were collected.\r\n\r\nOne of his strong characteristics was hatred of the Jews. He would cross\r\nthe street, in order not to meet one of them, and would throw away a\r\ngarment that had brushed against one of the race. One day he went home,\r\nand found his housekeeper bargaining with a Jew; he chased him away with\r\ngreat fury, sent the woman off to be purified, repaved the spot where the\r\nJew had stood, and gave the shoes in which he had chased him to a servant.\r\nWhen about to die Cano would not receive the sacrament from the priest who\r\nwas present, because he had communicated with Jews, and when a rude\r\ncrucifix was held before him he pushed it away. When he was reproved for\r\nthis he said: \"Vex me not with this thing; but give me a simple cross that\r\nI may adore it, both as it is, and as I can figure it in my mind.\" When\r\nthis was done, it is said that he died in a most edifying manner.\r\n\r\nVery few of Cano's architectural works remain; a few drawings of this sort\r\nare in the Louvre which are simple and elegant in style. The finest\r\ncarving by him is a small figure of the Virgin, now in the Cathedral of\r\nGranada. Eight of his pictures are in the Queen of Spain's gallery at\r\nMadrid, and the Church of Getafe, the Cathedral of Granada and that of\r\nMalaga have his works. A beautiful madonna, which was one of his latest\r\nworks, is in the chapel of the Cathedral of Valencia, and is lighted by\r\nvotive tapers only. His pictures are rare out of Spain. One of his\r\nportraits is in the Louvre. Other works are in Berlin, Dresden, Munich,\r\nand the Hermitage, St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe last Spanish painter of whom I shall speak belongs to a much later\r\nperiod. FRANCISCO GOYA Y LUCIENTES (1746-1828) was a student in Rome, and\r\nafter his return to Spain lived in fine style in a villa near Madrid. He\r\nwas painter to Charles IV., and was always employed on orders from the\r\nnobility. He painted portraits and religious pictures, but his chief\r\nexcellence was in painting caricatures. He was never weary of painting the\r\npriests and monks in all sorts of ridiculous ways. He made them in the\r\nform of apes and asses, and may be called the Hogarth of Spain, so well\r\ndid he hold up the people about him to ridicule. He painted with great\r\nboldness and could use a sponge or stick in place of a brush. Sometimes he\r\nmade a picture with his palette-knife, and put in the fine touches with\r\nhis thumb. He executed engravings also, and published eighty prints which\r\nhe called \"Caprices.\" These were very famous; they were satires upon all\r\nSpanish laws and customs. He also made a series of plates about the French\r\ninvasion, thirty-three prints of scenes in the bull-ring, and etchings of\r\nsome of the works of Velasquez. Portraits of Charles IV. and his queen by\r\nGoya are in the museum at Madrid. Works of his are in the Louvre and in\r\nthe National Gallery in London. His pictures sell for large prices. In\r\n1870 his picture of Charlotte Corday sold for five hundred and eighty-four\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French school of painting does not date earlier than the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and the painters of that time were few in number, and little is\r\nknown of them. Before the time when a French school could be said to exist\r\nthe kings of France employed foreign artists to decorate their palaces and\r\nchurches, and they naturally turned to the Italians for all that they\r\nneeded. Hence it happened that in its earliest days the French school was\r\nalmost entirely under Italian influence, and I shall first speak of French\r\nmasters who studied in Italy.\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS POUSSIN (1594-1665) may be said to belong to the seventeenth\r\ncentury, since he was born so late in the preceding one. Poussin was born\r\nin Normandy, and early began to draw and paint. He studied somewhat in\r\nFrance, and when thirty years old went to Rome, where, in reality, his\r\nartistic career began. He was a pupil of Andrea Sacchi, and received some\r\ninstruction from Domenichino also; but he formed his style principally by\r\nstudying the works of the ancients and those of the great Raphael. He was\r\nso devoted to the study of the habits and customs of the Greeks that he\r\nalmost became one of them in his modes of thought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--ARCADIAN SHEPHERDS. _Poussin._]\r\n\r\nHe was very poor when he first went to Rome; but he worked hard, and began\r\nto be known and to receive orders for pictures. Louis XIII. heard of\r\nPoussin, and invited him to Paris, where he gave him apartments in the\r\nTuileries. But the artist longed to return to Rome, and made a plea of\r\ngoing for his wife. Soon after he left, Louis died, and Poussin never\r\nreturned to France. Poussin was always busy; but he asked such moderate\r\nprices that he was never rich, and, when a great man pitied the artist\r\nbecause he had so few servants, Poussin pitied him in return for having so\r\nmany. His portrait painted by himself is in the Louvre, where are many of\r\nhis mythological pictures. His love for the classic manner makes these\r\nsubjects his best works. His paintings are seen in many European\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nCLAUDE LORRAINE (1600-1682), whose real name was Claude Gelée, was born in\r\nChampagne in Lorraine. His parents were very poor, and died when he was\r\nstill young: he was apprenticed to a pastry-cook, and so travelled to Rome\r\nas servant to some young gentlemen. Not long after his arrival he engaged\r\nhimself to the painter Agostino Tassi, for whom he cooked, and mixed\r\ncolors. After a time he himself began to paint. Nature was his teacher; he\r\nstudied her with unchanging devotion; he knew all her changes, and was in\r\nthe habit of sitting for a whole day watching one scene, so that he could\r\npaint from memory its different aspects at the various hours of the day.\r\nHis works brought him into notice when he was still young. He received\r\nmany orders, and when about twenty-seven years old some pictures he\r\npainted for Pope Urban VIII. established his fame as an artist of high\r\nrank. His character was above reproach, and his feelings were as tender as\r\nmany of his pictures. He was attractive in person, though his face was\r\ngrave in its expression. It would seem that he should have left a large\r\nfortune, but he did not. This was partly because he suffered much from\r\ngout, and was often unable to paint; but a better reason probably is that\r\nhe gave so much to his needy relations that he could not save large sums.\r\n\r\nClaude Lorraine has been called the prince and poet of landscape painters.\r\nLübke, the German art writer, praises him very much, and his praise is\r\nmore valuable than it would be if it came from one of Claude's own\r\ncountrymen. He says: \"Far more profoundly than all other masters did\r\nClaude Gelée penetrate into the secrets of nature, and by the enchanting\r\nplay of sunlight, the freshness of his dewy foregrounds, and the charm of\r\nhis atmospheric distances, he obtained a tone of feeling which influences\r\nthe mind like an eternal Sabbath rest. In his works there is all the\r\nsplendor, light, untroubled brightness, and harmony of the first morning\r\nof creation in Paradise. His masses of foliage have a glorious richness\r\nand freshness, and even in the deepest shadows are interwoven with a\r\ngolden glimmer of light. But they serve only as a mighty framework, for,\r\nmore freely than with other masters, the eye wanders through a rich\r\nforeground into the far distance, the utmost limits of which fade away in\r\ngolden mist.\"\r\n\r\nHis two great charms are the immense space which he represents in his\r\npictures and his beautiful color. The latter appears as if he had first\r\nused a silvery gray, and then put his other colors over that, which gives\r\nhis works a soft, lovely atmospheric effect, such as no other artist has\r\nsurpassed. When he introduced buildings into his pictures they were well\r\ndone; but his figures and animals were so imperfect that he was accustomed\r\nto say that he sold the landscape, and gave away the figures.\r\n\r\nBefore his death his pictures were so much valued that other artists tried\r\nto imitate them, and he was accustomed to keep a book of sketches by which\r\nhis works could be proved. He called this book \"Liber Veritatis,\" and\r\nbefore his death it reached six volumes; one of these containing two\r\nhundred drawings is at Chatsworth. A catalogue of his works describes more\r\nthan four hundred landscapes. All the principal galleries of Europe have\r\nhis pictures, and there are a great number of them in England, both in\r\npublic and private collections.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN BOURDON (1616-1671), who was born at Montpelier, made his\r\nstudies in Rome. He brought himself into notice by a picture of the\r\nCrucifixion of St Peter, which is now in the Louvre. He was one of the\r\nearliest members of the French Academy. Bourdon resided in Sweden for some\r\nyears; but was in Paris, and held the position of Rector of the Academy\r\nwhen he died. He painted a few _genre_ subjects, and two of his portraits\r\nby himself are in the Louvre; but his best works were landscapes, and in\r\nthese his style was like that of Salvator Rosa. It has been said that\r\nRigaud assisted him in his portraits of himself. Bourdon made some\r\nengravings, and collectors prize his plates very much.\r\n\r\nThere were other French painters who studied in Italy, but those that I\r\nhave mentioned are the important ones. Of those who studied in their own\r\ncountry only, EUSTACHE LE SUEUR (1617-1655) was the first of any\r\nimportance; but his life was short and uneventful, and he was not\r\nappreciated. His most important works are in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nCHARLES LE BRUN (1619-1690) was very prominent in his day. His father was\r\na sculptor, and was employed by the Chancellor Segnier. This nobleman's\r\nattention was attracted to the son, and he at length sent the young Le\r\nBrun to Italy to study. He remained there six years, and after his return\r\nto Paris he was made painter to the king, and became the favorite of the\r\ncourt. He used his opportunities to persuade Louis XIV. to found the Royal\r\nAcademy at Paris, which was done in 1648. All his principal pictures are\r\nin the Louvre.\r\n\r\nPIERRE MIGNARD (1612-1695) has been called \"the Roman,\" because he lived\r\nin Rome twenty-two years, and while there was patronized by three\r\nsuccessive popes. In 1664 he was made President of the Academy of St. Luke\r\nin Rome. At length Louis XIV. invited him to return to France. In 1690 he\r\nsucceeded Le Brun as court painter, and was made Chancellor of the\r\nAcademy. His portraits are his best works, and these are seen in the\r\ngalleries of various European countries.\r\n\r\nHYACINTHE RIGAUD (1659-1743) became the most distinguished French portrait\r\npainter of his time; but his pictures are not very attractive or\r\ninteresting in our day. He finished them too much, and so gave them an\r\nartificial appearance. Then, too, the costume of his day was such that his\r\nportraits seem to be the portraits of wigs and not of people. They are\r\nvery numerous. He often painted the portrait of Louis XIV., and had\r\nillustrious people from all parts of Europe among his sitters.\r\n\r\nANTOINE WATTEAU (1684-1721) was the first to practise a new style of\r\npainting. The habit of the French court was to pass much time in elegant\r\nout-door amusements. Watteau represented the scenes of the _fêtes\r\ngalantes_ and reunions then so much in fashion. His pictures are crowded\r\nwith figures in beautiful costumes. There are groups of ladies and\r\ngentlemen promenading, dancing, love-making, and lounging in pleasant\r\ngrounds with temples and fountains and everything beautiful about them.\r\nThe pictures of Watteau are fine, and are seen in many galleries. His\r\ncolor is brilliant, and to their worth as pictures is added the historical\r\ninterest which belongs to them, because they give us the best idea of\r\ncourt life, dress, and manners of the reign of Louis XIV. which can be had\r\nfrom any paintings.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Watteau were numerous, but are not of great importance.\r\nThere were a few painters of animals and flowers in the French school; but\r\nwe shall pass to the _genre_ painters, among whom JEAN-BAPTISTE GREUZE\r\n(1725-1805) was important. He painted very beautiful pictures of young\r\ngirls and children. His color is very agreeable, and some of his works are\r\nfinished as finely as if they were done on ivory. Most of his pictures\r\nare in private galleries, but they are seen in some public collections.\r\nProbably the \"Broken Jug,\" in the Louvre, is his best known work. His\r\npictures sell for very large prices. At the Forster sale in 1876, \"A\r\nLittle Girl with a Lap Dog in her Arms\" brought six thousand seven hundred\r\nand twenty pounds; in 1772 the same picture was sold for three hundred\r\npounds, and in 1832 it was again sold for seven hundred and three pounds.\r\nThus we see that in fifty-four years its value had increased to more than\r\nnine times its price, and in one hundred and four years it brought\r\ntwenty-two times as much as it was first sold for.\r\n\r\nCLAUDE JOSEPH VERNET (1714-1789) was the best marine painter of the French\r\nschool. Louis XV. commissioned him to paint the seaports of France.\r\nFifteen of these pictures are in the Louvre. There have been many\r\nengravings after his works. His pictures of Italian seaports and views\r\nnear Rome and Tivoli are among his best paintings. His color has little\r\nvariety; but his drawing is correct, and his finish is very careful and\r\nfine. Vernet also made a few etchings.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the eighteenth century JOSEPH MARIE VIEN (1716-1809)\r\nreturned to the classic style of painting, and created a feeling against\r\nthe pretty manner which had been the chief feature of French pictures for\r\nsome time. His pictures are very numerous in the churches and galleries of\r\nParis. He was not a great painter, but he marks a change in the spirit of\r\nFrench painting. Vien was the teacher of JACQUES LOUIS DAVID (1748-1825),\r\nwho was considered the first painter in modern art at the close of the\r\neighteenth century. He was so devoted to the classic style that he took\r\nthe remains of ancient art as models for the figures in his pictures. His\r\ngroups are like groups of statues, and his flesh looks like marble, it is\r\nso hard and lifeless. During the time of the first Napoleon this style\r\nwas carried to excess in everything connected with the arts. David was\r\nsuch a favorite with the emperor that after the return of the Bourbons he\r\nwas banished, and his family were not allowed to bury him in France. He\r\nlived in Brussels, and executed many of his best pictures there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--THE SABINE WOMEN. _David._]\r\n\r\nANTOINE JEAN GROS (1771-1835) was a great admirer of David, and first\r\nattracted attention in 1801 by a picture of \"Bonaparte on the Bridge of\r\nArcola.\" After this Gros painted many such works, and principally\r\nrepresented military events. Many of his pictures are very coarse. The\r\n\"Plague at Jaffa\" and the \"Field of Eylau\" are of this type, and the first\r\nis disgusting. Among his best works is \"Francis I. and Charles V. visiting\r\nthe Tombs at St. Denis.\" But although he received many honors, and was\r\nmade a baron by Charles X., he could not bear the criticism which was made\r\nupon his pictures, and finally drowned himself in the Seine near Meudon.\r\n\r\nPAUL DELAROCHE (1797-1856) was born at Paris, and studied under Baron\r\nGros. He became a celebrated artist and was made a member of the Institute\r\nof France, a Professor in l'École des Beaux-Arts, and an officer of the\r\nLegion of Honor. His principal works represent scenes of important\r\nhistorical interest, and he so arranged them that they appeal to one's\r\nsympathies with great power. Among these pictures are the \"Condemnation of\r\nMarie Antoinette,\" the \"Death of the Duke of Guise,\" \"Cromwell\r\nContemplating the Remains of Charles I.,\" and other similar historical\r\nincidents. His design was according to academical rules; but he was not\r\nentirely conventional, and in some of his religious pictures there was\r\nmuch expression and deep feeling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--DEATH OF THE DUKE OF GUISE. _Delaroche._]\r\n\r\nHis largest and most famous work is the \"Hemicycle,\" in l'École des\r\nBeaux-Arts, Paris. He was occupied with this painting during three years;\r\nit contains seventy-five figures of life size. The arts of different\r\ncountries and ages are represented in it by portraits of the artists of\r\nthe times and nations typified. Thus it is very interesting when\r\nconsidered merely as a great collection of portraits. Delaroche married\r\nthe daughter of Horace Vernet, and it is said that the figure which stands\r\nfor Gothic Architecture is a portrait of her. The Hemicycle is richly\r\ncolored, and has a great deal of fine painting in it; but from its very\r\nnature it has no dramatic power, and does not arouse any deep sentiment in\r\none who studies it. Delaroche was paid only about fifteen thousand dollars\r\nfor this great labor, and refused to have any further reward.\r\n\r\nPerhaps none of his works are more powerful than the \"Death of the Duke of\r\nGuise.\" You will easily recall the circumstances of his assassination: the\r\npainter has so represented it that one really forgets that it is a\r\npicture, and can only remember the horror of the crime. The corpse of the\r\nduke is on one side of the immense chamber, near the bed; the assassins\r\nare in a terrified group on the other side, and with them the cowardly\r\nking, who was absolutely afraid of the dead body of his victim. The\r\npicture is a remarkable instance of the power that may be given to what is\r\nsometimes called historical-genre art. This picture was sold in 1853 for\r\nten thousand five hundred dollars (Fig. 69).\r\n\r\nJEAN LOUIS GÉRICAULT (1791-1824). He was born at Rouen, and studied first\r\nunder Guérin and then in Rome. He was the first master of any power who\r\nentirely dismissed the influence of the art of David with its marble flesh\r\nand statuesque effect. The one great work by which he is known is the\r\n\"Wreck of the Medusa,\" which is in the Louvre, and which may be said to\r\nmark the advent of the modern French school.\r\n\r\nEUGENE DELACROIX (1799-1863) was the son of a Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nand was born to position and wealth. But through misfortunes all this was\r\nchanged, and he was forced to work hard for his living. At last he\r\nmanaged to study under Guérin, and in the studio of the master became the\r\nfriend of Géricault. The first work which brought Delacroix fame was a\r\npicture of a scene from Dante's \"Inferno,\" in which Dante sees some of his\r\nold acquaintances who were condemned to float upon the lake which\r\nsurrounds the infernal city. This work was exhibited in 1822, and was\r\nbought for the Gallery of the Luxembourg. Baron Gros tried to be his\r\nfriend; but Delacroix wished to follow his own course, and for some time\r\nhad but small success.\r\n\r\nHe travelled in Spain, Algiers, and Morocco, and at length was\r\ncommissioned by Thiers to do some decorative work in the throne-room of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies. He was much criticised, but at length was\r\naccepted as a great artist, and was made a member of the Institute in\r\n1857. He received another important order for the Chamber of Peers. Some\r\nof his works are at Versailles, and others are seen in various churches of\r\nParis. When they are considered as a whole they are effective, but they do\r\nnot bear examination; his design was free and spirited and his color good,\r\nand he painted a variety of subjects, and was able to vary the expression\r\nof his work to suit the impression he wished to produce.\r\n\r\nÉMILE JEAN HORACE VERNET (1789-1863) was born in the Louvre. He studied\r\nunder his father, Carle Vernet, who was the son of Claude Joseph Vernet.\r\nCarle was a witty man, and it is said that when he was dying he exclaimed,\r\n\"How much I resemble the Grand Dauphin--son of a king, father of a king,\r\nand never a king myself!\" In spite of his being less than his father or\r\nhis son, he was a good painter of horses. When Horace Vernet was but\r\nfifteen years old he supported himself by drawing; he studied with\r\nVincent, and drew from living models. In 1814 he showed such bravery at\r\nthe Barriere of Clichy that he was decorated with the Cross of the Legion\r\nof Honor: before he died he was a grand officer of the order on account\r\nof his artistic merits. He was also a member of the Institute and Director\r\nof the Academy of Rome.\r\n\r\nHis best works were executed in Rome, where he spent seven years; he\r\ntravelled in Algiers, Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Russia, and England, and\r\nwas everywhere received with the honors which his genius merited. His\r\nworks embraced a great variety of subjects, and it is said that he often\r\nfinished his picture the first time he went over it, and did not retouch\r\nit. There is no doubt that in certain ways the excellence of Vernet has\r\nbeen overestimated, and he has been too much praised; but his remarkable\r\nmemory, which enabled him truthfully to paint scenes he had witnessed, and\r\nhis facility of execution, are worthy of honorable mention.\r\n\r\nWhen twenty years old Vernet was married, and from this time he kept an\r\nexpense account in which all the prices he received for his works are set\r\ndown. The smallest is twenty-four sous for a tulip; the largest is fifty\r\nthousand francs for the portrait of the Empress of Russia.\r\n\r\nAbout 1817 Vernet became the favorite of the Duke of Orleans, and was\r\ntherefore unpopular with the royal party. In 1820 he had made himself so\r\ndispleasing to the king by some lithographs which were scattered among the\r\npeople, that it was thought best for him to leave Paris. However, he\r\novercame all this, and four years later Charles X. sat to him for his\r\nportrait. From this time orders and money flowed in from all sides.\r\n\r\nThe Vernets had originated in Avignon, and in 1826, when the museum there\r\nwas opened, Horace and his father were invited to be present. Every honor\r\nwas shown them; poems were read in their praise; they were conducted to\r\nthe home of their ancestors, which they piously saluted, and inscribed\r\ntheir names upon the door-posts. After they returned to Paris they\r\nreceived rich gifts in return for the pictures they had given to Avignon.\r\nThe Gallery Vernet, which contains works by Antoine, François, Joseph,\r\nCarle, and Horace Vernet, is regarded as a sacred place by the people of\r\nthat region.\r\n\r\nWhen Horace Vernet was Director of the Academy in Rome he held _salons_\r\nweekly; they were very gay, and all people of distinction who lived in\r\nRome or visited that city were seen at these receptions, dancing and\r\namusing themselves in the lively French manner. But after 1830 he felt\r\nthat the Villa Medici was a prison. He wished to follow the French army in\r\nthe East, and three years later did go to Algiers. In the same year the\r\nking decided to convert the palace at Versailles into an historical\r\nmuseum, and from this time Vernet had but two ideas, the East and\r\nVersailles. Almost every work he did was connected with these two\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe now desired him to paint four battle-pieces; but Vernet\r\nobjected that no room was large enough to please him: for this reason a\r\nfloor was removed, two stories turned into one, and the grand Gallery of\r\nBattles made. At length he had a difficulty with the king and went to\r\nRussia; but hearing that his father was dying he returned to Paris, and\r\nwas made welcome back to Versailles, where he was really necessary.\r\n\r\nWe cannot stay to recount the honors which were showered upon him, and\r\nwhich he always received with great modesty of demeanor. He went from one\r\ntriumph to another until 1848, when the Revolution almost broke his heart;\r\nhe worked on, but his happiness was over. In the great Exposition of 1855\r\nhe had a whole _salon_ devoted to his works, and men from all the world\r\ncame to see and to praise. He lived still eight years; he made pictures of\r\nincidents in the Crimean War; he painted a portrait of Napoleon III., but\r\nhe wrote of himself: \"When time has worn out a portion of our faculties we\r\nare not entirely destroyed; but it is necessary to know how to leave the\r\nfirst rank and content one's self with the fourth.\"\r\n\r\nHis industry and the amount of work he did are simply marvellous. He loved\r\nexcitement and adventure, and the works which have these elements were his\r\nbest--and he liked best to do them. His color cannot be praised; he had no\r\nlofty intellectual aims; he was clever to a high degree, but he was not\r\ngreat; he was one to whom the happy medium of praise should be given, for\r\nhe neither merits severity of criticism nor immoderate praise; he was\r\nsimply a gifted painter and \"the greatest and last of the Vernets.\"\r\n\r\nHe is also the last French painter of whom we shall speak, as we do not\r\npropose to take up the excellent artists of our own day, who would require\r\na volume devoted strictly to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early days in England there were miniature-painters, and in the last\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century there were some very important English\r\npainters of this kind. Before the days of Charles I. the English kings\r\nwere much in the habit of inviting foreign artists to England, and\r\ncommissions were given to them. The painters who were most prominent in\r\nEngland were of the Flemish school, and even under Charles I., as we have\r\nseen, Rubens and Vandyck were the principal painters in England. But in\r\nthe reign of this king some native artists made names for themselves, and\r\nwhat we call the English school of painting may really be dated from this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of painters I must mention one miniaturist whose works\r\nwere in demand in other countries, as well as in England. SAMUEL COOPER\r\n(1609-1672) has been called \"the Vandyck in little,\" and there is far more\r\nbreadth in his works than is usual in miniature. He painted likenesses of\r\nmany eminent persons, and his works now have an honorable place in many\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DOBSON (1610-1646) has been mentioned in our account of Vandyck as\r\na painter whom the great master befriended and recommended to Charles I.\r\nHe became a good portrait-painter, and after Vandyck's death was appointed\r\nsergeant-painter to the king. His portraits are full of dignity; the face\r\nshadows are dark, and his color excellent. He did not excel in painting\r\nhistorical subjects. Vandyck was succeeded at court by two foreign artists\r\nwho are so closely associated with England that they are always spoken of\r\nas English artists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.]\r\n\r\nPETER VAN DER FAES (1618-1680), who was born in Westphalia, is known to us\r\nas Sir PETER LELY. He became the most celebrated portrait-painter after\r\nVandyck, and his \"Beauties at Hampton Court\" are pictures which are known\r\nthe world over. He has been accused of not painting eyes as he ought; but\r\nthe ladies of his day had an affectation in the use of their eyes. They\r\ntried to have \"the sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul,\" so Sir Peter\r\nLely was not to blame for painting them as these ladies wished them to be.\r\nHe was knighted by Charles II., and became very rich. His portraits of men\r\nwere not equal to those of women. When Cromwell gave him a commission to\r\npaint his portrait, he said: \"Mr. Lely, I desire you will use all your\r\nskill to paint my picture truly like me, and not flatter me at all; but\r\nremark all these roughnesses, pimples, warts, and everything as you see\r\nme, otherwise I will never pay you a farthing for it.\" Sir Peter Lely was\r\nburied in Covent Garden, where there is a monument to his memory with a\r\nbust by Gibbon.\r\n\r\nSir GODFREY KNELLER (1646-1723), born at Lübeck, was a rival to Sir Peter\r\nLely, and had the honor of painting the portraits of eight crowned heads\r\nand a very great number of other people of importance. He had studied both\r\nthe Dutch and Italian manner; for he was the pupil of Rembrandt and Bol,\r\nof Carlo Maratti and Bernini. Some critics praise his pictures very much,\r\nwhile others point out many defects in them. He painted very rapidly, and\r\nhe sometimes hurried his pictures off for the sake of money; but his\r\nfinished works are worthy of remark. He especially excelled in painting\r\nhair; his drawing was correct; some of his groups of children are fine\r\npictures; and some madonnas that he painted, using his sitters as models,\r\nare works of merit. His monument was made by Rysbrach, and was placed in\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nBoth Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey Kneller had pupils and followers; but\r\nthere was no original English artist before the time of WILLIAM HOGARTH\r\n(1697-1764), and he may really be named as the first master of a purely\r\nEnglish school of painting. When Hogarth was fifteen years old he was\r\napprenticed to a silversmith, and the grotesque designs which he copied\r\nfor armorial bearings helped to increase his natural love for all that was\r\nridiculous and strange. After 1718 he was much occupied in engraving for\r\nbooksellers, and at length he began to paint small _genre_ pictures and\r\nsome portraits, in which he made good success, but he felt that he was\r\nfitted for other work. In 1730 he married the daughter of the artist, Sir\r\nJames Thornhill, without the consent of her father.\r\n\r\nSoon after this he began his series of pictures called the \"Harlot's\r\nProgress,\" and when Sir James saw them he was so satisfied with the talent\r\nof Hogarth that he declared that such an artist could support a wife who\r\nhad no dower, and the two painters were soon reconciled to each other.\r\nBefore 1744 Hogarth had also painted the series of the \"Rake's Progress\"\r\nand \"Marriage à la Mode\" (Fig. 71).\r\n\r\nThese are all pictures which hold up the customs of the time to ridicule\r\nand satire, and his works of this kind are almost numberless. He explains\r\nas follows the cause of his painting in this way: \"The reasons which\r\ninduced me to adopt this mode of designing were that I thought both\r\ncritics and painters had, in the historical style, quite overlooked that\r\nintermediate species of subjects which may be placed between the sublime\r\nand the grotesque. I therefore wished to compose pictures on canvas\r\nsimilar to representations on the stage; and further hope that they will\r\nbe tried by the same test and criticised by the same criticism.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT. _No. 1 of The Marriage à\r\nla Mode. By Hogarth. In the National Gallery._]\r\n\r\nIt was in this sort of picture that Hogarth made himself great, though he\r\nsupported himself for several years by portrait-painting, in which art he\r\nholds a reputable place. Most of his important pictures are in public\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nHogarth was a fine engraver, and left many plates after his own works,\r\nwhich are far better and more spirited than another artist could have made\r\nthem. The pictures of Hogarth have good qualities aside from their\r\npeculiar features. He made his interiors spacious, and the furniture and\r\nall the details were well arranged; his costumes were exact, as was also\r\nthe expression of his faces; his painting was good, and his color\r\nexcellent. In 1753 he published a book called the \"Analysis of Beauty.\"\r\n\r\nEver after his first success his career was a prosperous one. He rode in\r\nhis carriage, and was the associate and friend of men in good positions.\r\nHogarth was buried in Chiswick Churchyard, and on his tombstone are these\r\nlines, written by David Garrick:\r\n\r\n      \"Farewell, great painter of mankind!\r\n       Who reach'd the noblest point of Art,\r\n       Whose pictur'd morals charm the mind,\r\n       And through the eye, correct the heart.\r\n       If Genius fire thee, reader, stay;\r\n       If Nature touch thee, drop a tear;\r\n       If neither move thee, turn away,\r\n       For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies here.\"\r\n\r\nThe next important English painter was RICHARD WILSON (1713-1782), and he\r\nwas important not so much for what he painted as for the fact that he was\r\none of the earliest landscape-painters among English artists. He never\r\nattained wealth or great reputation, although after his return from\r\nstudying in Italy he was made a member of the Royal Academy.\r\n\r\nWe come now to Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS (1723-1792), born at Plympton, in\r\nDevonshire. His father was a clergyman and the master of the grammar\r\nschool at Plympton. Joshua was destined for the medical profession by his\r\nparents; but his love of drawing was so marked that, as the opportunity\r\noffered for him to go to London and study under Hudson, his father allowed\r\nhim to do so. After various changes, in 1749 he was able to go to Rome,\r\nand remained in Italy three years (Fig. 70).\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to England he soon attracted attention to his pictures,\r\nand it was not long before both fame and fortune were secured to him. His\r\nlife was a very quiet one, with little of incident that can be related\r\nhere. His sister kept his house for him, and he lived generously, having\r\ncompany to dinner almost daily. His friends were among the best people of\r\nthe time, including such persons as Dr. Johnson, Percy, Goldsmith,\r\nGarrick, the Burkes, and many others. The day before Johnson died he told\r\nReynolds that he had three requests to make of him: that he would forgive\r\nhim thirty pounds which he had lent him, would read the Scriptures daily,\r\nand would not paint on Sunday. Sir Joshua promised to do these things, and\r\nremembered his promise.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua was skilful in compliments. When he painted his famous picture\r\nof Mrs. Siddons as the \"Tragic Muse\" he put his name on the border of her\r\ngarment. The actress went near the picture to examine it, and when she saw\r\nthe name she smiled. The artist said: \"I could not lose the opportunity of\r\nsending my name to posterity on the hem of your garment.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--\"MUSCIPULA.\" _By Reynolds._]\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds' fame rests upon his portraits, and in these he is\r\nalmost unrivalled. His pictures of children are especially fine. It was\r\nhis custom to receive six sitters daily. He kept a list of those who were\r\nsitting and of others who waited for an opportunity to have their\r\nportraits made by him. He also had sketches of the different portraits\r\nhe had painted, and when new-comers had looked them over and chosen the\r\nposition they wished, he sketched it on canvas and then made the likeness\r\nto correspond. In this way, when at his best, he was able to paint a\r\nportrait in about four hours. His sitters' chairs moved on casters, and\r\nwere placed on a platform a foot and a half above the floor. He worked\r\nstanding, and used brushes with handles eighteen inches long, moving them\r\nwith great rapidity.\r\n\r\nIn 1768 Sir Joshua was made the first President of the Royal Academy, and\r\nit was then that he was knighted by the king. He read lectures at the\r\nAcademy until 1790, when he took his leave. During these years he sent two\r\nhundred and forty-four pictures to the various exhibitions. In 1782 he had\r\na slight shock of paralysis, but was quite well until 1789, when he feared\r\nthat he should be blind, and from this time he did not paint. He was ill\r\nabout three months before his death, which occurred in February, 1792. His\r\nremains were laid in state at the Royal Academy, and then buried in St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral, near the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the colors used by Sir Joshua Reynolds are now\r\nmuch faded in many of his pictures. Those in the National Gallery, in\r\nLondon, are, however, in good preservation. Naturally, since so many of\r\nhis pictures were portraits they are in the collections of private\r\nfamilies in England, and but few of them are seen in European galleries.\r\nThere is an excellent opportunity to study his manner in the pictures at\r\nthe South Kensington Museum, where there are several portraits, some\r\npictures of children, and the \"Graces Decorating a Statue of Hymen.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very satisfactory to think of a great artist as a genial, happy man,\r\nwho is dear to his friends, and has a full, rich life outside of his\r\nprofession. Such a life had Sir Joshua Reynolds, and one writer says of\r\nhim: \"They made him a knight--this famous painter; they buried him 'with\r\nan empire's lamentation;' but nothing honors him more than the 'folio\r\nEnglish dictionary of the last revision' which Johnson left to him in his\r\nwill, the dedication that poor, loving Goldsmith placed in the 'Deserted\r\nVillage,' and the tears which five years after his death even Burke could\r\nnot forbear to shed over his memory.\"\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GAINSBOROUGH (1727-1788) was born in Sudbury, in Suffolk, and when\r\nstill quite young went to London, and studied under Francis Hayman, who\r\nwas not an eminent painter. Gainsborough became one of the most important\r\nmasters of the English school, especially in landscape painting and the\r\nrepresentation of rustic figures. His portraits were not as good in color\r\nas those of Sir Joshua Reynolds; they have a bluish-gray hue in the flesh\r\ntints; but they are always graceful and charming. His landscapes are not\r\nlike those of any other master. They are not exact in the detail of leaves\r\nand flowers--a botanist could find many faults in them--but they are like\r\nnature in spirit: they seem to have the air blowing through them, they are\r\nfresh and dewy when it is morning in them, and quiet and peaceful when\r\nevening comes under his brush. In many of his pictures he put a cart and a\r\nwhite animal.\r\n\r\nHis rustic figures have the true country life in them: they seem to have\r\nfed upon the air, and warmed themselves in the sun until they are plump\r\nand rosy as country lads and lasses should be. His best _genre_ pictures\r\nare the \"Cottage Girl,\" the \"Woodman and Dog in a Storm,\" the \"Cottage\r\nDoor,\" and the \"Shepherd Boy in a Shower.\" He painted a picture of a \"Girl\r\nand Pigs,\" for which Sir Joshua Reynolds paid him one hundred guineas.\r\n\r\nIn character Gainsborough was very attractive, though somewhat\r\ncontradictory in his moods. He was generous and genial, lovable and\r\naffectionate; he was also contradictory and impulsive, not to say\r\ncapricious. His wife and he had little quarrels which they settled in this\r\nwise: When Gainsborough had spoken to her unkindly, he would quickly\r\nrepent, and write a note to say so, and address it to his wife's spaniel,\r\ncalled \"Tristram,\" and sign it with the name of his pet dog, \"Fox.\" Then\r\nMargaret Gainsborough would answer: \"My own, dear Fox, you are always\r\nloving and good, and I am a naughty little female ever to worry you as I\r\ntoo often do, so we will kiss, and say no more about it; your own\r\naffectionate Tris.\" Like Reynolds, Gainsborough had many warm friends, and\r\nwhen he died Sir Joshua himself watched by his bedside, and bent to catch\r\nhis last word, which was the name of Vandyck.\r\n\r\nJOHN SINGLETON COPLEY (1737-1815) was born in Boston, Mass., U. S., to\r\nwhich place his parents are said to have immigrated from Limerick,\r\nIreland. The father was descended from the Copleys of Yorkshire, England,\r\nand the mother from the Singletons of County Clare, both families of note.\r\nWhen young Copley was eleven years old his mother was married to Peter\r\nPelham, a widower with three sons--Peter, Charles, and William--and who\r\nsubsequently became the father of another son, Henry, by this second\r\nmarriage. Mr. Pelham was a portrait painter and a mezzotint engraver of\r\nunusual merit. One authority calls him \"the founder of those arts in New\r\nEngland.\" Mr. Pelham was also a man of education, a land surveyor, and a\r\nmathematician. He was thus well qualified to educate, assist, and\r\nstimulate young Copley in the pursuit of studies so natural and congenial\r\nto him. He is said to have been studious and quiet, and to have made rapid\r\nadvances. When he was fifteen years old he painted a portrait of his\r\nstep-brother, Charles Pelham, now in the family of a great-grandson, Mr.\r\nCharles Pelham Curtis, of Boston. At sixteen he published an engraving of\r\nRev. William Welsteed, from a portrait painted by himself. The same year\r\nhe painted the portrait of a child--afterward Dr. de Mountfort--now owned\r\nin Detroit. In 1754 he painted an allegorical picture of Mars, Venus, and\r\nVulcan, thirty inches long by twenty-five wide, now owned in Bridgewater,\r\nMass. The next year he painted a miniature of George Washington, who was\r\non a visit to Governor Shirley at the time. This picture now belongs to\r\nthe family of the late George P. Putnam, of New York City. In 1756 he\r\npainted a three-quarters length portrait of General William Brattle, life\r\nsize, signed and dated, and now owned by Mr. William S. Appleton. He now\r\nimproved rapidly. A crayon portrait of Miss Rebecca Gardiner, afterward\r\nMrs. Philip Dumaresq, an oil painting of Mrs. Edmund Perkins, a portrait\r\nof Rebecca Boylston, afterward wife of Governor Gill, portraits of Colonel\r\nand Mrs. Lee, grandparents of General William Raymond Lee, all exist and\r\nattest the continued growth of his powers. These date between 1763 and\r\n1769. During this time he had access to and was a visitor in houses where\r\nwere portraits by Saribest, Blackburn, Liopoldt, and even by Vandyck and\r\nSir Godfrey Kneller. Mr. Augustus Thorndike Perkins, in his carefully\r\nwritten monograph on Copley, says that our artist must have seen all these\r\npictures, since, as Dr. Gardiner says, \"his genial disposition and his\r\ncourtly manners make him a welcome guest everywhere.\" Mr. Perkins remarks\r\nthat Copley must have studied with Blackburn; that he imitated, but in\r\nsome respects surpassed him. \"Both frequently used, either as the lining\r\nof a dress or as drapery, a certain shade of mauve pink; Blackburn uses\r\nthis shade feebly, while Copley dashes it on with the hand of a master.\"\r\nOn November 16, 1769, Copley married Susan (or Susannah, as it is\r\nsometimes written), the daughter of Mr. Richard Clarke, a distinguished\r\nmerchant of Boston, to whom, as agent of the East India Company of London,\r\nwas consigned the tea thrown overboard in Boston harbor. From all accounts\r\nhe soon began to live in good style; and as, in 1771, Colonel Trumbull\r\nfound him living opposite the Common, it is probable that he purchased at\r\nabout that time the property which afterward became so valuable, although\r\nlong after Copley had ceased to be the owner. In 1773, says the late\r\neminent conveyancer, Nathaniel Ingersoll Bowditch, \"Copley owned all the\r\nland bounded on the west by Charles River, thence by Beacon Street to\r\nWalnut Street, thence by Walnut Street to Mt. Vernon Street, thence by Mt.\r\nVernon Street to Louisburg Square, thence by Louisburg Square to Pinckney\r\nStreet, thence by Pinckney Street to the water, containing about eleven\r\nacres of land.\" This land is now covered with handsome residences, and is\r\nof great value. An agent of Copley's sold his property after he went\r\nabroad without being authorized to do so, and, although his son came over\r\nin 1795 to look into the matter, he was only able to secure a compromise\r\nby which a further sum of three thousand guineas was paid in final\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nSoon after his marriage Copley painted his picture of a \"Boy with a\r\nSquirrel,\" which he sent anonymously to Benjamin West, in London, for\r\nexhibition. West judged from the wood on which the picture was stretched\r\nand from the kind of squirrel that the work was American, and so excellent\r\nwas the painting that a rule of the institution was set aside, and the\r\npicture exhibited. This picture is now in the possession of Mrs. James S.\r\nAmory, of Boston, a granddaughter of the artist. The boy in the picture\r\nwas his half-brother Henry. The picture was so favorably received that\r\nCopley was advised to go to England. He sailed in 1774, and never\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nMr. Copley, soon after his arrival in London, passed over to the\r\nContinent, and through Italy, studying in Parma and in Rome. He visited\r\nNaples and Pæstum also. It is said that he studied so diligently that he\r\nwas with difficulty persuaded to paint two portraits in Rome. In 1775 he\r\ntravelled and studied in Germany, in Holland, and in France. This same\r\nyear his wife and family joined him in England. These consisted of his\r\nwife, his son, John Singleton, who afterward became the famous Lord\r\nChancellor Lyndhurst; his daughter Elizabeth, afterward married to a\r\ndistinguished merchant in Boston, and who survived to a great age; Mary\r\nCopley, who lived unmarried to the great age of ninety-four; and another\r\nson who died young. In 1777 he was made an Associate of the Royal Academy,\r\nand six years later an Academician. He was now in the full tide of\r\nsuccess. He was offered five hundred guineas to paint a family group of\r\nsix persons. The well-known group of Copley's family, called the \"Family\r\nPicture,\" the \"Death of Lord Chatham,\" and \"Watson and the Shark,\" were on\r\nhis easel in 1780. The picture of Lord Chatham falling senseless in the\r\nHouse of Lords was commenced soon after his death in 1778. It was engraved\r\nby Bartolozzi, and twenty-five hundred copies were sold in a few weeks.\r\nCopley exhibited the picture, to his own profit as well as fame.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 occurred the death of Major Pierson, shot in the moment of victory\r\nover the French troops who had invaded the island of Jersey. His death was\r\ninstantly avenged by his black servant, and of this scene Copley made one\r\nof his finest pictures. He took pains, with his usual honesty, to go to\r\nSt. Helier's, and make a drawing of the locality. The picture is\r\nthoroughly realistic, although painful. His large picture of the \"Repulse\r\nand Defeat of the Spanish Floating Batteries at Gibraltar\" was painted on\r\ncommission from the city of London. It is twenty-five feet long by\r\ntwenty-two and a half feet high; but there are so many figures and so much\r\ndistance to be shown in the painting that the artist really needed more\r\nroom. Of the commander, Lord Heathfield, Sir Robert Royd, Sir William\r\nGreen, and some twelve or fifteen others, the artist made careful\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\nThe story told by Elkanah Watson shows Copley's strong sympathy for\r\nAmerica. In 1782 Watson was in London, and Copley made a full-length\r\nportrait of him, and in his journal Watson says: \"The painting was\r\nfinished in most exquisite style in every part, except the background,\r\nwhich Copley and I designed to represent a ship bearing to America the\r\nacknowledgments of our independence. The sun was just rising upon the\r\nstripes of the Union streaming from her gaff. All was complete save the\r\nflag, which Copley did not deem proper to hoist under the present\r\ncircumstances, as his gallery was the constant resort of the royal family\r\nand the nobility. I dined with the artist on the glorious 5th of December,\r\n1782. After listening with him to the speech of the king formally\r\nrecognizing the United States of America as in the rank of nations,\r\nprevious to dinner, and immediately after our return from the House of\r\nLords, he invited me into his studio, and there, with a bold hand, a\r\nmaster's touch, and, I believe, an American heart, he attached to the ship\r\nthe stars and stripes. This was, I imagine, the first American flag\r\nhoisted in Old England.\"\r\n\r\nCopley purchased, for a London residence, the mansion-house in George\r\nStreet belonging to Lord Fauconburg. It afterward became more widely known\r\nas the residence of his son, Lord Lyndhurst. Lord Mansfield's residence\r\nwas near by, and among the many commissions from public men was one to\r\npaint his lordship's portrait. Perhaps one of the most interesting of all\r\nhis commissions was one to paint the picture of Charles I. demanding the\r\nfive obnoxious members from the Long Parliament, for which a number of\r\ngentlemen in Boston paid one thousand five hundred pounds. It is said that\r\nevery face in this great picture was taken from a portrait at that time\r\nextant; and Mrs. Gardiner Greene narrates that she and her father were\r\ndriven in a post-chaise over a considerable part of England, visiting\r\nevery house in which there was a picture of a member of the famous\r\nParliament, and were always received as honored guests. Copley's painting\r\nof the death of Lord Chatham was much admired. So numerous were the\r\nsubscriptions for the engraving that it is said Copley must have received\r\nnearly, or quite, eleven thousand pounds for the picture and the engraved\r\ncopies. It was quite natural for Copley to be popular with New Englanders;\r\nindeed, almost every Bostonian, at one time, on visiting London, made a\r\npoint to bring home his portrait by Copley, if possible. There are known\r\nto exist in this country two hundred and sixty-nine oil-paintings,\r\nthirty-five crayons, and fourteen miniatures by him. These pictures are\r\ncarefully cherished, as are indeed all memorials of this generous and\r\nkindly gentleman. Although his life was mostly passed in England, where he\r\nobtained wealth and renown, yet in a strong sense he could be claimed for\r\nBoston, as it was there he was born; it was there he received his artistic\r\nbias and education; it was there he was married, and had three children\r\nborn to him; and, finally, it was there that he acquired a fair amount of\r\nfame and property solely by his brush. It will be worth while for the\r\nreaders of this volume to take pains to see some of the more noteworthy\r\nCopleys.\r\n\r\nA portrait of John Adams, full length, painted in London in 1783, is now\r\nin possession of Harvard College. A portrait of Samuel Adams,\r\nthree-quarters length, spirited and beautiful, standing by a table, and\r\nholding a paper, hangs in Faneuil Hall. Another picture of Samuel Adams is\r\nin Harvard College, which also owns several other Copleys. A portrait of\r\nJames Allen, a man of fortune, a patriot, and a scholar, is now owned by\r\nthe Massachusetts Historical Society. The \"Copley Family,\" one of the\r\nartist's very best pictures, is now owned in Boston by Mr. Amory, and, in\r\nfact, Mrs. James S. Amory owns a number of his best works.\r\n\r\nCopley was a man of elegance and dignity, fond of the beautiful,\r\nparticular in his dress, hospitable, and a lover of poetry and the arts.\r\nHis favorite book was said to be \"Paradise Lost.\" His last picture was on\r\nthe subject of the Resurrection.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN WEST (1738-1820) was born at Springfield, Pennsylvania, of Quaker\r\nparentage. In the various narratives of his successful life many stories\r\nare told which appear somewhat fabulous, and most of which have nothing to\r\ndo with his subsequent career. He is said to have made a pen-and-ink\r\nportrait of his little niece at the age of seven years; to have shaved the\r\ncat's tail for paint brushes; to have received instruction in painting and\r\narchery from the Indians; to have so far conquered the prejudices of his\r\nrelatives and their co-religionists to his adoption of an artist's life\r\nthat he was solemnly consecrated to it by the laying on of hands by the\r\nmen, and the simultaneous kissing of the women. His love for art must have\r\nbeen very strong, and he was finally indulged, and assisted in it by his\r\nrelatives, so that at the age of eighteen he was established as a\r\nportrait-painter in Philadelphia. By the kindness of friends in that city\r\nand in New York he was enabled to go to Italy, where he remained three\r\nyears, making friends and reputation everywhere. Parma, Florence, and\r\nBologna elected him a member of their Academies. He was only twenty-five\r\nyears old when he went to England, on his way back to America. But he was\r\nso well received that he finally determined to remain in England, and a\r\nyoung lady named Elizabeth Shewell, to whom he had become engaged before\r\ngoing abroad, was kind and judicious enough to join him in London, where\r\nshe became his wife, and was his faithful helpmate for fifty years. In\r\n1766 he exhibited his \"Orestes and Pylades,\" which on account of its\r\nnovelty and merit produced a sensation. He painted \"Agrippina weeping over\r\nthe Urn of Germanicus,\" and by the Archbishop of York was introduced to\r\nGeorge III. as its author. He immediately gained favor with the king, and\r\nwas installed at Windsor as the court-painter with a salary of one\r\nthousand pounds per annum. This salary and position was continued for\r\nthirty-three years. He painted a series of subjects on a grand scale from\r\nthe life of Edward III. for St. George's Hall, and twenty-eight scriptural\r\nsubjects, besides nine portrait pictures of the royal family. In 1792, on\r\nthe death of Reynolds, he was elected President of the Royal Academy, a\r\nposition which, except a brief interregnum, he held until his death in\r\nMarch, 1820. He was greatly praised in his day, and doubtless thought\r\nhimself a great artist. He painted a vast number of portraits and quite a\r\nnumber of pictures of classical and historical subjects. His \"Lear\" is in\r\nthe Boston Athenæum; his \"Hamlet and Ophelia\" is in the Longworth\r\ncollection in Cincinnati; \"Christ Healing the Sick\" is in the Pennsylvania\r\nHospital; and the \"Rejected Christ\" is or was owned by Mr. Harrison, of\r\nPhiladelphia. There are two portraits of West, one by Allston and one by\r\nLeslie, in the Boston Athenæum, and a full-length, by Sir Thomas Lawrence,\r\nin the Wadsworth Gallery in Hartford, Conn. One of West's pictures did a\r\ngreat deal for his reputation, although it was quite a departure from the\r\ntreatment and ideas then in vogue; this was the \"Death of General Wolfe\"\r\non the Plains of Abraham. When it was known to artists and amateurs that\r\nhis purpose was to depict the scene as it really might have happened he\r\nwas greatly ridiculed. Even Sir Joshua Reynolds expressed an opinion\r\nagainst it; but when he saw the picture he owned that West was right.\r\nHitherto no one had painted a scene from contemporary history with figures\r\ndressed in the costume of the day. But West depicted each officer and\r\nsoldier in his uniform, and gave every man his pig-tail who wore one. The\r\npicture is spirited and well grouped. West was just such a practical,\r\nthoughtful, and kindly man as we might expect from his ancestry and\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nGEORGE ROMNEY (1734-1802), born in Beckside, near Dalton, in Cumberland.\r\nHe married when he was twenty-two, and in his twenty-seventh year went to\r\nLondon with only thirty pounds in his pocket, leaving his wife with\r\nseventy pounds and two young children. He returned home to die in 1799,\r\nand in the meantime saw his wife but twice. The year after his arrival in\r\nLondon he carried off the fifty-guinea prize on the subject of the \"Death\r\nof Wolfe\" from the Society of Arts. Through the influence of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds this was reconsidered, and the fifty-guinea prize was awarded to\r\nMortimer for his \"Edward the Confessor,\" while Romney was put off with a\r\ngratuity of twenty-five guineas. This produced a feud between the two\r\nartists. Romney showed his resentment by exhibiting in a house in Spring\r\nGardens, and never sending a picture to the Academy, while Reynolds would\r\nnot so much as mention his name, but spoke of him as \"the man in Cavendish\r\nSquare.\" This was after his return from the Continent; but before going to\r\nItaly he was distinctly the rival of Sir Joshua, so much so that there\r\nwere two factions, and Romney's studio, in Great Newport Street, was\r\ncrowded with sitters, among whom was the famous Lord Chancellor Thurlow,\r\nwhose full-length portrait is the pride of its possessor. At this time he\r\nwas making about twelve hundred pounds a year, a very good income for\r\nthose days. In 1773 he went to Rome with a letter to the Pope from the\r\nDuke of Richmond. His diary, which he kept for a friend, shows how\r\nconscientious and close was his observation and how great his zeal. He\r\nmade a copy of the \"Transfiguration,\" for which he refused one hundred\r\nguineas, and which finally sold for six guineas after his death. On his\r\nreturn to London in 1775 he took the house in Cavendish Square, where he\r\nhad great success. He painted a series of portraits of the Gower family,\r\nthe largest being a group of children dancing, which Allan Cunningham\r\ncommended as being \"masterly and graceful.\" Some of his portraits have a\r\ncharm beyond his rivals. He painted portraits of Lady Hamilton, the friend\r\nof Lord Nelson--\"the maid of all work, model, mistress, ambassadress, and\r\npauper\"--scores of times, and in different attitudes and a variety of\r\ncharacters, as Hebe, a Bacchante, a Sibyl, as Joan of Arc, as\r\n\"Sensibility,\" as a St. Cecilia, as Cassandra, as Iphigenia, as Constance,\r\nas Calypso, as Circe, and as Mary Magdalen, and in some of these\r\ncharacters many times. He often worked thirteen hours a day, and did his\r\nfancy sketches when sitters disappointed him. He would paint a portrait of\r\na gentleman in four sittings. He was extremely fond of portraying\r\nShakespeare's characters, and contributed to the Shakespeare Gallery\r\nformed by Alderman Boydell. He went to Paris in 1790, where Lord and Lady\r\nGower introduced him to Louis Philippe, and through him to all the art\r\ntreasures of the French capital. On his return to London he formed a plan\r\nof an art museum, to be furnished with casts of the finest statues in\r\nRome, and spent a good deal of money in the erection of a large building\r\nfor the purpose. His powers as an artist gradually waned. He left his\r\nCavendish Square residence in 1797, and in 1799 returned to his family and\r\nhome at Kendall. From this time to the close of his life in 1802 he was a\r\nmere wreck, and his artist life was over.\r\n\r\nGEORGE MORLAND (1763-1804) was born in London, and the son of an artist.\r\nHis father was unsuccessful, and poor George was articled to his father,\r\nafter the English fashion, and was kept close at home and at work. It is\r\nsaid that his father stimulated him with rich food and drink to coax him\r\nto work. He was very precocious, and really had unusual talents. His\r\nsubjects were those of rustic life, and his pictures contain animals\r\nwonderfully well painted, but his pigs surpass all. His character was\r\npitiful; he was simply, at his best, a mere machine to make pictures. As\r\nfor goodness, truth, or nobleness of any sort, there is not a syllable\r\nrecorded in his favor. Strange to say, the pictures of his best time are\r\nmasterpieces in their way, and have been sold at large prices.\r\n\r\nSir THOMAS LAWRENCE (1769-1830), born at Bristol, England, in the White\r\nHart Inn, of which his father was landlord. He was wonderfully precocious,\r\nand as a child of five years would recite odes, and declaim passages from\r\nMilton and Shakespeare. Even at this early period he made chalk or pencil\r\nportraits, and at nine he finally decided to become a painter from having\r\nseen a picture by Rubens. At this period he made a colored chalk portrait\r\nof the beautiful Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, which still hangs in\r\nChiswick House, in the room in which Charles Fox died. His father was the\r\nson of a clergyman, and was bred a lawyer, but had never prospered; still\r\nhis culture and education gave a certain zest and tone to the mind of\r\nyoung Lawrence, and made him, with his elegant figure and handsome face,\r\nthe successful courtier that he afterward became. He worked hard, with\r\nconsiderable success, and with but little instruction until, at the age of\r\neighteen, he went to London for the first time. At that period he was\r\ndescribed as being extremely handsome in person, with fine, regular\r\nfeatures, brilliant eyes, and long, chestnut-colored hair falling to his\r\nshoulders. He lodged close by Sir Joshua Reynolds--then near the end of\r\nhis career, and from him received much valuable advice. During Lawrence's\r\nfirst years in London he attempted pictures illustrating classic art, but\r\nwithout much success. Indeed he was never successful in large, imaginative\r\npictures, and during most of his career of more than forty years, confined\r\nhimself to portraits. The time was propitious for him: Gainsborough was\r\ndead; Reynolds was almost blind, and had given up painting; and Romney had\r\nno hold on the court and the leaders of fashion. Lawrence raised his\r\nprices, and had all he could do. He adopted a more expensive style of\r\ndress, and in fact lived so extravagantly that he never arrived at what\r\nmay be called easy circumstances--his open-handed generosity contributed\r\nto this result. He early received commissions from the royal family. In\r\n1791 he was elected an Associate, and in 1794 an Academician. The next\r\nyear George III. appointed him painter in ordinary to his Majesty. He was\r\nthus fairly launched on a career that promised the highest success. In a\r\ncertain sense he had it, but largely in a limited sense. He painted the\r\nportraits of people as he saw them; but he never looked behind the costume\r\nand the artificial society manner. He reproduced the pyramidically shaped\r\ncoats and collars, the overlapping waistcoats of different colors, the\r\nHessian boots, and the velvet coats, adorned with furs and frogs, of the\r\nfine gentlemen; and the turbans with birds-of-Paradise feathers, the gowns\r\nwithout waists, the bare arms and long gloves, the short leg-of-mutton\r\nsleeves, and other monstrosities of the ladies. And for thirty years his\r\nsitters were attired in red, or green, or blue, or purple. He absolutely\r\nrevelled in the ugliness of fashion. Occasionally Lawrence did some very\r\ngood things, as when he painted the Irish orator and patriot, Curran, in\r\none sitting, in which, according to Williams, \"he finished the most\r\nextraordinary likeness of the most extraordinary face within the memory of\r\nman.\" He always painted standing, and often kept his sitters for three\r\nhours at a stretch, and sometimes required as many as nine sittings. On\r\none occasion he is said to have worked all through one day, through that\r\nnight, the next day, and through all the night following! By command of\r\nthe prince regent he painted the allied sovereigns, their statesmen,\r\nprinces, and generals--all the leading personages, in fact, in alliance\r\nagainst Napoleon. His pictures in the exhibition of 1815 were Mrs. Wolfe,\r\nthe Prince Regent, Metternich, the Duke of Wellington, Blucher, the Hetman\r\nPlatoff, and Mr. Hart Davis. During the Congress that met at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle in 1818, Lawrence was commissioned by the Prince Regent to\r\npaint its principal heads for an especial gallery. He thus had for sitters\r\nnearly all the leading statesmen of Europe. From Aix-la-Chapelle he went\r\nto Vienna, and thence to Rome in 1819, where among others he painted\r\nlikenesses of the Pope, of Cardinal Gonsalvi, and of Canova. Of the\r\nlatter, Canova cried out, \"Per Baccho, che nomo e questo!\" It was\r\nconsidered a marvellous likeness; and without violating good taste he\r\nworked into the picture crimson velvet and damask, gold, precious marble,\r\nand fur, with a most brilliant effect. Before reaching home in London he\r\nwas elected President of the Royal Academy. At this time he had been\r\nelected a member of the Roman Academy of St. Luke's, of the Academy of\r\nFine Arts in Florence, and of the Fine Arts in New York. He continued to\r\nimprove as a painter, and between 1825 and the year of his death, painted\r\nand exhibited some of his finest works. He usually exhibited eight\r\npictures each year, and although without a rival, gave evidence of anxious\r\ncare to sustain his reputation. He was especially successful with\r\nchildren, and many of these pictures--as well as of celebrities--were\r\nengraved, and have thus become known all over the world. Of his eight\r\npictures exhibited in 1829--the last he ever contributed--Williams says:\r\n\"It is difficult to imagine a more undeviating excellence, an infallible\r\naccuracy of likeness, with an elevation of art below which it seemed\r\nimpossible for him to descend.\" Lawrence died on the morning of the 7th of\r\nJanuary, 1830, with but little warning, from ossification of the heart; he\r\nwas buried with much pomp and honor in St. Paul's Cathedral, by the side\r\nof Sir Joshua Reynolds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--PORTRAIT OF TURNER.]\r\n\r\nJOSEPH M. W. TURNER, R.A. (1775-1851).--It is believed, by those who have\r\ninvestigated the question most carefully, that this eminent artist and\r\nmost remarkable man was born in Maiden Lane, London, April 3, 1775,\r\nalthough the artist himself has stated that he was born in Devonshire,\r\nApril 23, 1769. Turner's father, William Turner, was a native of\r\nDevonshire, but came to London while young, and did a fair business in the\r\nCovent Garden district as a hair-dresser, wig-maker, and in shaving\r\npeople. The father was garrulous, like the traditional hair-dresser, with\r\na pleasant laugh, and a fresh, smiling face. He had a parrot nose and a\r\nprojecting chin. Turner's mother was a Miss Mallord (or Marshall), of good\r\nfamily, but a violent-tempered woman, with a hawk nose and a fierce\r\nvisage. Her life ended in a lunatic asylum. The artist, who was always\r\nimpatient of inquiry into his domestic matters, resented any allusion to\r\nhis mother, and never spoke of her. The manifest peculiarities of his\r\nparents had an impression upon Turner, and would have made him eccentric\r\nhad there been no other influences of a kindred nature. The parents were\r\nunder-sized, and of limited mental range; they were of very little\r\npersonal assistance to their gifted son, although the father in later\r\nyears busied himself in mixing colors, adjusting pictures to frames, and\r\nsometimes he was entrusted with certain rough work at filling in\r\nbackgrounds. When Turner was but five years old he is said to have made,\r\nfrom memory, a fair copy of a lion rampant engraved on a silver salver,\r\nwhich he had seen while accompanying his father to the house of a\r\ncustomer. Presently the boy began to copy pictures in water-colors, and\r\nthen to make sketches from nature of scenes along the river Thames. In his\r\nninth year he drew a picture of Margate Church. When he was ten years old\r\nhe was sent to school at Brentford-Butts, where he remained two years,\r\nboarding with his uncle, the local butcher. His leisure hours were spent\r\nin dreamy wanderings and in making countless sketches of birds, trees,\r\nflowers, and domestic fowls. He acquired a smattering of the classics and\r\nsome knowledge of legends and ancient history. On his return to London he\r\nreceived instruction from Palice in painting flowers, and, after a year or\r\ntwo, was sent to Margate, in Kent, to Coleman's school. Here he had more\r\nscope and a wider range, and made pictures of the sea, the chalk cliffs,\r\nthe undulations of the coast, and the glorious effects of cloud scenery.\r\nOn his return from Margate he began to earn money by coloring engravings\r\nand by painting skies in amateurs' drawings and in architects' plans at\r\nhalf a crown an evening. He always deemed this good practice, as he thus\r\nacquired facility and skill in gradations. His father at one time thought\r\nto make an architect of him, and sent him to Tom Malton to study\r\nperspective. But he failed in the exact branch of the profession, and\r\nneither with Malton nor with the architect Hardwick did he give\r\nsatisfaction. While with Hardwick he drew careful sketches of old houses\r\nand churches, and this practice must have been of much use to him in\r\nafter-life. His father finally sent him to the Royal Academy, where he\r\nstudied hard, drawing from Greek models and the formal classic\r\narchitecture. About this time he was employed, at half a crown an evening,\r\nwith supper thrown in, to make copies of pictures by Dr. Munro, of Adelphi\r\nTerrace. Munro was one of the physicians employed in the care of George\r\nIII. when he had a crazy spell, and owned many valuable pictures by\r\nSalvator-Rosa, Rembrandt, Snyder, Gainsborough, Hearne, Cozens, and\r\nothers. He had also portfolios full of drawings of castles and cathedrals,\r\nand of Swiss and Italian scenery, and of sketches by Claude and Titian.\r\nTurner was also employed to sketch from nature in all directions about\r\nLondon. In these tasks he had for a constant companion \"Honest Tom\r\nGirtin,\" a young fellow of Turner's own age, who afterward married a\r\nwealthy lady, had rich patrons, and died before he was thirty. Had he\r\nlived to mature years, Girtin would have been a powerful rival to Turner.\r\nThey were most excellent friends, and when Girtin died in Rome, Turner was\r\none of his most sincere mourners. Toward the close of Sir Joshua Reynolds'\r\nlife, Turner frequented his studio, copied pictures, and acquired some art\r\nsecrets. He began to teach water-color drawing in schools, while still a\r\nboy, at from a crown to a guinea a lesson. He made hundreds of sketches in\r\na part of London now built over compactly with houses in streets and\r\nsquares, but then picturesque in hills and dells, in wooded fields and\r\ngreen lanes. With all his baggage tied in a handkerchief on the end of his\r\nwalking-stick, he made a sketching tour through the towns of Rochester,\r\nCanterbury, Margate, and others, in Kent, in 1793, and about this time\r\nbegan to paint in oil. His first contribution to the Royal Academy was a\r\nwater-color sketch in 1790. Within the next ten years he exhibited over\r\nsixty pictures of castles, cathedrals, and landscapes. All through his\r\nlife he made sketches. Wherever he was, if he saw a fine or an unusual\r\neffect, he treasured it up for use. He sketched on any bit of paper, or\r\neven on his thumb-nail, if he had nothing better. Nothing escaped his\r\nattention, whether of earth, or sea, or sky. Probably no artist that ever\r\nlived gave nature such careful and profound study. His studies of cloud\r\nscenery were almost a revelation to mankind. In all this Turner drew his\r\ninstruction as well as his inspiration from nature. The critics did\r\nnothing for him; he rather opened the eyes of even such men as Ruskin to\r\nthe wonders of the natural world. But these results all came later, and\r\nwere the fruit of and resulted from his constant and incessant studies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--NANTES. _By Turner._]\r\n\r\nIn 1794 and 1795 he made elaborate drawings of Rochester, Chepstow,\r\nBirmingham, Worcester, Guildford, Cambridge, and other towns, for\r\nmagazines. In 1796 he did the same for Chester, Bristol, Leith,\r\nPeterborough, and Windsor. Within the next four years he completed the\r\ncircuit of twenty-six counties in England and Wales, and he also exhibited\r\ntwenty-three highly finished drawings of cathedrals and churches. He was\r\nslow to undertake oil-painting, preferring the more rapid touch and the\r\nlight-and-shade effect of the crayon, or the delicate and beautiful\r\neffects of water-colors. He was always greater as a painter in\r\nwater-colors than in oils, and it is claimed by Redgrave that \"the art all\r\nbut began with him,\" and that his water-color paintings \"epitomize the\r\nwhole mystery of landscape art.\" Some of his paintings in this line have\r\nbeen sold at enormous prices, and even in his own day his water-color\r\npicture of Tivoli sold for eighteen hundred guineas. Turner became as fond\r\nof Northern Yorkshire--which he first visited in 1797--as he was of\r\nSouthern Kent. He found there a great variety of scenery, from the sweet\r\nand peaceful to the ennobling and grand. He visited and made studies from\r\nall the old cathedrals, castles, and abbeys, and in 1798 he exhibited\r\npictures of Fountain and Kirkstall Abbeys, Holy Island Cathedral,\r\nButtermere Lake, Dunstanborough Castle, as well as \"Morning Among the\r\nCorriston Fells.\" He found in Yorkshire also some of his warmest friends\r\nand most munificent patrons, notably Mr. Hawkesworth Fawkes, of Farnley\r\nHall, whose house was adorned with fifty thousand dollars' worth of\r\nTurner's pictures. Some additions to Farnley Hall were designed by Turner,\r\nand he was always a welcome visitor. Here he sketched, and at intervals\r\nenjoyed himself greatly in hunting and fishing. It is said that the\r\nFarnley portfolios still contain sketches not only of the hall and its\r\nprecincts, but of coast scenes, Swiss views, drawings of birds,\r\nillustrations of the Civil War, and, more especially, of fifty-three\r\nremarkable drawings of the Rhineland regions, done at the rate of three a\r\nday; these last were offered by Turner to Mr. Fawkes on his return from\r\nthe Continent for the sum of five hundred pounds, and the bargain was\r\nclosed at once. When Mr. Fawkes visited London he spent hours in Turner's\r\nprivate gallery, but was never shown into the painting-room. Indeed, very\r\nfew persons were ever allowed there. Once, when Turner dined at a hotel\r\nwith Mr. Fawkes, the artist took too much wine, and reeled about,\r\nexclaiming, \"Hawkey, I am the real lion--I am the great lion of the day,\r\nHawkey.\" When Mr. Fawkes died, ended Turner's visits to Farnley. He never\r\nwent there again, but when the younger Fawkes brought the Rhine drawings\r\nup to London for him to see again, he passed his hand over the \"Lorelei\r\nTwilight,\" saying, with tears in his eyes, \"But Hawkey! but Hawkey!\" When\r\nMr. Wells, an artist of Addiscomb, died he mourned his loss bitterly, and\r\nexclaimed to his daughter: \"Oh, Clara, Clara, these are iron tears! I have\r\nlost the best friend I ever had in my life!\" In this family all the\r\nchildren loved him. He would lie on the floor, and play with them, and the\r\noldest daughter afterward said: \"Of all the light-hearted, merry creatures\r\nI ever knew, Turner was the most so.\" But in 1797 Turner had a bitter\r\ndisappointment which warped and distorted all his after-life. A young lady\r\nto whom he had become attached while a schoolboy at Margate, was engaged\r\nto be married to him. He had been absent for two years on sketching tours,\r\nand the step-mother of the young lady had intercepted and destroyed his\r\nletters, so that at last she believed the representations made that Turner\r\nhad deserted her. She became engaged to another, and was about to be\r\nmarried, when Turner appeared, and pleaded passionately that she would\r\nreturn to him. She thought that she had been trifled with, and held by her\r\nrefusal, and did not find out the wrongs done by the step-mother until it\r\nwas too late. This disappointment led to greater self-concentration and\r\nstingy money-getting until it became the absorbing passion of his life, so\r\nthat the artist passion was dominated by it.\r\n\r\nIt would take up too large a portion of this book to describe even briefly\r\nTurner's travels and works. Only a bare outline can be given. In 1800 he\r\nbecame an Associate of the Royal Academy. He moved into a more commodious\r\nhouse at 64 Harley Street. During this year he exhibited pictures of\r\nCaernarvon Castle and the \"Fifth Plague of Egypt;\" also fine views of\r\nFonthill Abbey, the new palace of Beckford, with whom he spent much time.\r\nThe only portrait for which Turner ever sat was painted in 1800 by George\r\nDance. It shows a handsome young man, with a full but receding forehead,\r\narched eyebrows, a prominent nose, a massive chin, and a sensual mouth.\r\nHis thick and wiry hair is tied behind, and he wears a coat with an\r\nimmense cape. By this time full-bottomed wigs had gone out of fashion, and\r\nthe old barber abandoned his business to go and live with his artist son.\r\nIn 1801 Turner exhibited pictures of St. Donat's Castle and Pembroke\r\nCastle in Wales, the Salisbury Chapter-house, an autumn morning in London,\r\nthe destruction of the Median army, and Dutch fishing-boats in a gale. He\r\nhad begun his contest with Claude by painting pictures of classical\r\nsubjects in Claude's manner. Turner was elected Royal Academician in 1802,\r\nand exhibited several notable oil-paintings, signed with all his initials,\r\nwhich he thenceforth used. The Academy had been quick to recognize\r\nTurner's genius, and he was always its faithful, conservative, and zealous\r\nfriend. As an auditor, councillor, or a visitor he was scrupulous, and he\r\nattended general meetings and formal dinners with the same promptitude and\r\ncertainty with which for forty-five years he sent his pictures to the\r\nannual exhibitions. He was a peacemaker in debates, but in business he was\r\nirresolute. In 1802 he visited the Continent for the first time,\r\ntravelling in France, Switzerland, and Italy, and everywhere making\r\nsketches. At this time he carried sketch-books in which he jotted\r\neverything--all manner of drawings and outlines of nature and\r\narchitecture, notes of local gossip, chemical memoranda, notes of\r\nexpenses, tavern bills, views of coasts and cities, ruins, castles,\r\nmanufacturing works, and detached figures. One book gives views about the\r\nSimplon Pass, another the sea-coast from Nice to Genoa, another contains\r\ncountless jottings from the pictures in the Vatican, another is taken up\r\nwith views in Paris and Rouen, and several are devoted to Scottish\r\nscenery.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 Turner began his _Liber Studiorum_, in rivalship of Claude's\r\n_Liber Veritatis_; it was issued in parts in dark blue covers, each part\r\ncontaining five plates. It was discontinued in 1814, after seventy plates\r\nhad been issued. Although not remunerative at the time, in later days as\r\nhigh as three thousand pounds has been paid for a single copy of the\r\n_Liber_, while the subscription price was only seventeen pounds ten\r\nshillings; even before Turner died a copy of it was worth over thirty\r\nguineas. Charles Turner, the engraver, used the proofs for kindling-paper;\r\nbut some years later Colnaghi, the print dealer, paid him fifteen hundred\r\npounds for his remaining \"rubbish,\" as he considered it. \"Good God!\" cried\r\nthe old engraver; \"I have been burning bank-notes all my life!\" In 1878\r\nProfessor Norton, of Harvard University, published a set of thirty-three\r\nof the best of the _Liber_ studies, reproduced in Boston by the heliotype\r\nprocess. The _Liber Studiorum_ was intended to manifest Turner's command\r\nof the whole compass of the landscape art, and was divided into six heads:\r\nhistorical, pastoral, elegant pastoral, mountain, marine, and\r\narchitectural.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Turner was appointed Professor of Perspective in the Royal\r\nAcademy. During two or three years only, out of the thirty in which he\r\nheld the professorship, did he deliver lectures. He spoke in a deep and\r\nmumbling voice, was confused and tedious in manner, and frequently became\r\nhopelessly entangled in blind mazes of obscure words. Sometimes when he\r\nhad written out his lectures he was unable to read them. Once, after\r\nfumbling in his pockets, he exclaimed: \"Gentlemen, I've been and left my\r\nlecture in the hackney-coach.\" Still he was interested in this work, and\r\nRuskin says: \"The zealous care with which Turner endeavored to do his duty\r\nis proved by a large existing series of drawings, exquisitely tinted, and\r\noften completely colored, all by his own hand, of the most difficult\r\nperspective subjects--illustrating not only directions of light, but\r\neffects of light, with a care and completion which would put the work of\r\nany ordinary teacher to utter shame.\" During this year he took a house at\r\nHammersmith, Upper Mall, the garden of which ran down to the Thames, but\r\nstill retained his residence in Harley Street. In 1812 he first occupied\r\nthe house No. 47 Queen Anne Street, and this house he retained for forty\r\nyears. It was dull, dingy, unpainted, weather-beaten, sooty, with unwashed\r\nwindows and shaky doors, and seemed the very abode of poverty, and yet\r\nwhen Turner died his estate was sworn as under one hundred and forty\r\nthousand pounds--seven hundred thousand dollars. When Turner's father died\r\nin 1830 he was succeeded by a withered and sluttish old woman named Danby.\r\nThe whole house was dreary, dirty, damp, and full of litter. The master\r\nhad a fancy for tailless--Manx--cats, and these made their beds everywhere\r\nwithout disturbance. In the gallery were thirty thousand fine proofs of\r\nengravings piled up and rotting. His studio had a fair north light from\r\ntwo windows, and was surrounded by water-color drawings. His sherry-bottle\r\nwas kept in an old second-hand buffet.\r\n\r\nAbout 1813 or 1814 Turner purchased a place at Twickenham; he rebuilt the\r\nhouse, and called it Solus Lodge. The rooms were small, and contained\r\nmodels of rigged ships which he used in his marine views; in his\r\njungle-like garden he grew aquatic plants which he often copied in\r\nforegrounds. He kept a boat for fishing and marine sketching; also a gig\r\nand an old cropped-eared horse, with which he made sketching excursions.\r\nHe made at this time the acquaintance of Rev. Mr. Trimmer, the rector of\r\nthe church at Heston, who was a lover of art, and often took journeys with\r\nTurner. While visiting at the rectory Turner regularly attended church in\r\nproper form; and finally he wrote a note to Mr. Trimmer, alluding to his\r\naffection for one of the rector's kinswomen, and suggesting: \"If\r\nMiss ---- would but waive bashfulness, or in other words make\r\nan offer instead of expecting one, the same [Lodge] might change\r\noccupiers.\" But Turner was doomed to disappointment, and never made\r\nanother attempt at matrimony. In 1814 Turner commenced his contributions\r\nof drawings to illustrate \"Cook's Southern Coast,\" and continued this\r\ncongenial work for twelve years, making forty drawings at the rate of\r\nabout twenty guineas each; the drawings were returned to the artist after\r\nbeing engraved. In 1815 he exhibited the \"Dido Building Carthage,\" and in\r\n1817 a companion picture, the \"Decline of the Carthaginian Empire,\" and\r\nfor these two pictures the artist refused five thousand pounds, having\r\nsecretly willed them to the National Gallery.\r\n\r\nRuskin divides Turner's art life into three periods: that of study, from\r\n1800 to 1820; that of working out art theories toward an ideal, from 1820\r\nto 1835; and that of recording his own impressions of nature, from 1835 to\r\n1845, preceded by a period of development, and followed by a period of\r\ndecline, from 1845 to 1850. Besides his pictures painted on private\r\ncommission, Turner exhibited two hundred and seventy-five pictures at the\r\nAcademy. The \"Rivers of England\" was published in 1824, with sixteen\r\nengravings after Turner; another series contained six illustrations of the\r\n\"Ports of England\"--second-class cities. In 1826 the \"Provincial\r\nAntiquities of Scotland\" was published, with thirteen illustrations by\r\nTurner. The same year he sold his house at Twickenham, because, he said,\r\n\"Dad\" was always working in the garden, and catching abominable colds. In\r\n1827 Turner commenced the \"England and Wales\" on his own account, and\r\ncontinued it for eleven years. It consisted of a hundred plates,\r\nillustrating ports, castles, abbeys, cathedrals, palaces, coast views, and\r\nlakes. In 1828 Turner went to Rome by way of Nismes, Avignon, Marseilles,\r\nNice, and Genoa; and this year painted his \"Ulysses Dividing Polyphemus,\"\r\nof which Thornbury says: \"For color, for life and shade, for composition,\r\nthis seems to me to be the most wonderful and admirable of Turner's\r\nrealisms.\" Ruskin calls it his central picture, illustrating his perfect\r\npower.\r\n\r\nOf Turner's wonderful versatility, Ruskin says: \"There is architecture,\r\nincluding a large number of formal 'gentlemen's seats;' then lowland\r\npastoral scenery of every kind, including nearly all farming operations,\r\nplowing, harrowing, hedging and ditching, felling trees, sheep-washing,\r\nand I know not what else; there are all kinds of town life, court-yards of\r\ninns, starting of mail coaches, interiors of shops, house-buildings,\r\nfairs, and elections; then all kinds of inner domestic life, interiors of\r\nrooms, studies of costumes, of still-life and heraldry, including\r\nmultitudes of symbolical vignettes; then marine scenery of every kind,\r\nfull of local incident--every kind of boat, and the methods of fishing for\r\nparticular fish being specifically drawn--round the whole coast of\r\nEngland; pilchard-fishing at St. Ives, whiting-fishing at Margate, herring\r\nat Loch Fyne, and all kinds of shipping, including studies of every\r\nseparate part of the vessels, and many marine battle-pieces; then all\r\nkinds of mountain scenery, some idealized into compositions, others of\r\ndefinite localities, together with classical compositions; Romes and\r\nCarthages, and such others by the myriad, with mythological, historical,\r\nor allegorical figures; nymphs, monsters, and spectres, heroes and\r\ndivinities.... Throughout the whole period with which we are at present\r\nconcerned, Turner appears as a man of sympathy absolutely infinite--a\r\nsympathy so all-embracing that I know nothing but that of Shakespeare\r\ncomparable with it. A soldier's wife resting by the roadside is not\r\nbeneath it; Rizpah watching the dead bodies of her sons, not above it.\r\nNothing can possibly be so mean as that it will not interest his whole\r\nmind and carry his whole heart; nothing so great or solemn but that he\r\ncan raise himself into harmony with it; and it is impossible to prophesy\r\nof him at any moment whether the next he will be in laughter or tears.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1832 Turner made a will in which he bequeathed the bulk of his estate\r\nfor the founding of an institution \"for the Maintenance and Support of\r\nPoor and Decayed Male Artists being born in England and of English parents\r\nonly, and of lawful issue.\" It was to be called \"Turner's Gift,\" and for\r\nthe next twenty years the artist pinched, and economized to increase the\r\nfund for his noble purpose. At this time he was entering upon his third\r\nmanner--that of his highest excellence, when he \"went to the cataract for\r\nits iris, and the conflagration for its flames; asked of the sky its\r\nintensest azure, of the sun its clearest gold.\" It is remarked by Ruskin,\r\nwho has made most profound study of Turner's works, that he had an\r\nunderlying meaning or moral in his groups of foreign pictures; in\r\nCarthage, he illustrated the danger of the pursuit of wealth; in Rome, the\r\nfate of unbridled ambition; and in Venice, the vanity of pleasure and\r\nluxury. The Venetian pictures began in 1833, with a painting of the Doge's\r\nPalace, Dogana, Campanile, and Bridge of Sighs; and with these were\r\nexhibited \"Van Tromp Returning from Battle,\" the \"Rotterdam Ferry-boat,\"\r\nand the \"Mouth of the Seine.\" In 1830 or 1831 he made, on commission from\r\nthe publisher Cadell, twenty-four sketches to illustrate Walter Scott's\r\npoems--published in 1834--and while doing this he was entertained royally\r\nat Abbotsford, and made excursions with Scott and Lockhart to Dryburgh\r\nAbbey and other points of interest. He went as far north as the Isle of\r\nSkye, where he drew Loch Corriskin, and nearly lost his life by a fall.\r\nAbout this time he made a series of illustrations for Scott's \"Life of\r\nNapoleon.\" Turner spent some time in Edinburgh, frequently sketching with\r\nThomson, a clergyman and local artist, who was preferred by some of the\r\nScotch amateurs to Turner. He one day called at Thomson's house to examine\r\nhis paintings, but instead of expected praises he merely remarked, \"You\r\nbeat me in frames.\" Turner made thirty-three illustrations for Rogers's\r\n\"Poems\" (Fig. 75), and seventeen for an extended edition of Byron. He was\r\nin the habit at this time of frequently walking to Cowley Hall, the\r\nresidence of a Mr. Rose, where he was kindly welcomed. He was there called\r\n\"Old Pogey.\" One day Mrs. Rose asked him to paint her favorite spaniel; in\r\namazement he cried, \"My dear madam, you do not know what you ask;\" and\r\nalways after this the lady went by the title of \"My dear madam.\" Mr. Rose\r\ntells how he and Turner sat up one night until two o'clock drinking cognac\r\nand water, and talking of their travels. When Mrs. Rose and a lady, a\r\nfriend, visited Turner in a house in Harley Street, in mid-winter, they\r\nwere entertained with wine and biscuits in a cold room, without a fire,\r\nwhere they saw seven tailless cats, which Turner said were brought from\r\nthe Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--ILLUSTRATION FROM ROGERS'S POEMS.]\r\n\r\nFor three years Turner travelled in France, and made studies and sketches\r\nup and down its rivers. These were first published as \"Turner's Annual\r\nTour,\" but were afterward brought out by Bohn as \"Liber Fluviorum.\" These\r\nsketches have been highly praised by Ruskin; but Hammerton, who certainly\r\nknows French scenery far more accurately than Ruskin, while praising the\r\nexquisite beauty of Turner's work, challenges its accuracy, and especially\r\nas to color, saying that \"Turner, as a colorist, was splendid and\r\npowerful, but utterly unfaithful.\" Leitch Ritchie, who was associated with\r\nTurner in this work, could not travel with him, their tastes were so\r\nunlike; and he says that Turner's drawings were marvellously exaggerated,\r\nthat he would make a splendid picture of a place without a single correct\r\ndetail, trebling the height of spires and throwing in imaginary\r\naccessories. Turner always claimed the right to change the groupings of\r\nhis landscapes and architecture at will, preferring to give a general and\r\nidealized view of the landscape rather than a precise copy thereof.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 he exhibited \"Heidelberg Castle in the Olden Time,\"\r\n\"Ehrenbreitstein,\" \"Venice from the Salute Church,\" and \"Line-fishing off\r\nHastings.\" In 1836 he exhibited a \"View of Rome from the Aventine Hill,\"\r\nand the \"Burning of the House of Lords and Commons,\" which last was almost\r\nentirely painted on the walls of the exhibition. At this time it was the\r\ncustom to have what were called \"varnishing days\" at the exhibition,\r\nduring which time artists retouched, and finished up their pictures. They\r\nwere periods of fun and practical jokes, and Turner always enjoyed, and\r\nmade the most of them. He frequently sent his canvas to the Academy merely\r\nsketched out and grounded, and then coming in as early as four in the\r\nmorning on varnishing days, he would put his nose to the sketch and work\r\nsteadily with thousands of imperceptible touches until nightfall, while\r\nhis picture would begin to glow as by magic. About this time he exhibited\r\nmany pictures founded on classical subjects, or with the scenes laid in\r\nItaly or Greece, as \"Apollo and Daphne in the Vale of Tempe,\" \"Regulus\r\nLeaving Rome to Return to Carthage,\" the \"Parting of Hero and Leander,\"\r\n\"Phryne Going to the Public Baths as Venus,\" the \"Banishment of Ovid from\r\nRome, with Views of the Bridge and Castle of St. Angelo.\" A year later he\r\nexhibited pictures of \"Ancient Rome,\" a vast dreamy pile of palaces, and\r\n\"Modern Rome,\" with a view of the \"Forum in Ruins.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated of Turner's pictures was that of the \"Old\r\nTéméraire,\" an old and famous line-of-battle ship, which in the battle of\r\nTrafalgar ran in between and captured the French frigates Redoubtable and\r\nFougueux. Turner saw the Téméraire in the Thames after she had become\r\nold, and was condemned to be dismantled. The scene is laid at sunset, when\r\nthe smouldering, red light is vividly reflected on the river, and\r\ncontrasts with the quiet, gray and pearly tints about the low-hung moon.\r\nThe majestic old ship looms up through these changing lights, bathed in\r\nsplendor. The artist refused a large price for this picture by Mr. Lennox,\r\nof New York, and finally bequeathed it to the nation. In 1840 Turner\r\nexhibited the \"Bacchus and Ariadne,\" two marine scenes, and two views in\r\nVenice; also the well-known \"Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and\r\nDying, a Typhoon Coming On\" (Fig. 76), which is now in the Museum of Fine\r\nArts of Boston. Of this picture Thackeray says: \"I don't know whether it\r\nis sublime or ridiculous.\" But Ruskin, in \"Modern Painters,\" says: \"I\r\nbelieve if I were reduced to test Turner's immortality upon any single\r\nwork, I should choose the 'Slave Ship.' Its daring conception, ideal in\r\nthe highest sense of the word, is based on the purest truth, and wrought\r\nout with the concentrated knowledge of a life. Its color is absolutely\r\nperfect, not one false or morbid hue in any part or line, and so modulated\r\nthat every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition; its drawing as\r\naccurate as fearless; the ship buoyant, bending, and full of motion; its\r\ntones as true as they are wonderful; and the whole picture dedicated to\r\nthe most sublime of subjects and impressions (completing thus the perfect\r\nsystem of all truth which we have shown to be formed by Turner's works),\r\nthe power, majesty, and deathfulness of the open, deep, illimitable sea.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--THE SLAVE SHIP. _By Turner._]\r\n\r\nNo painter of modern times, or perhaps of any time, has ever provoked the\r\ndiscussion of his merits which Turner did. When he was at his best his\r\ngreat merits and his originality procured for him the strongest defenders,\r\nand finally brought his pictures into favor with the wealthy middle class\r\nof England, so that he obtained high prices, and since his death these\r\nprices have doubled, and even quadrupled. At a sale of Mr. Bicknell's\r\ncollection in 1836, ten of Turner's pictures, which had been bought for\r\nthree thousand seven hundred and forty-nine pounds, were sold for\r\nseventeen thousand and ninety-four pounds. As Turner grew older and his\r\nmanner deteriorated he was assailed by the wits, the art critics, and the\r\namateurs with cruel badinage, and to these censures Turner was morbidly\r\nsensitive. But even Ruskin admits that the pictures of his last five years\r\nare of \"wholly inferior value,\" with unsatisfactory foliage, chalky faces,\r\nand general indications of feebleness of hand.\r\n\r\nWornum, in his _Epochs of Painting_, said: \"In the last ten years of his\r\ncareer, and occasionally before, Turner was extravagant to an extreme\r\ndegree; he played equally with nature and with his colors. Light, with all\r\nits prismatic varieties, seems to have been the chief object of his\r\nstudies; individuality of form or color he was wholly indifferent to. The\r\nlooseness of execution in his latest works has not even the apology of\r\nhaving been attempted on scientific principles; he did not work upon a\r\nparticular point of a picture as a focus and leave the rest obscure, as a\r\nfoil to enhance it, on a principle of unity; on the contrary, all is\r\nequally obscure and wild alike. These last productions are a calamity to\r\nhis reputation; yet we may, perhaps, safely assert that since Rembrandt\r\nthere has been no painter of such originality and power as Turner.\" Dr.\r\nWaagen says in his _Treasury of Art in Great Britain_: \"No landscape\r\npainter has yet appeared with such versatility of talent. His historical\r\nlandscapes exhibit the most exquisite feeling for beauty of hues and\r\neffect of lighting, at the same time that he has the power of making them\r\nexpress the most varied moods of nature.\"\r\n\r\nToward the last part of his life Turner's peculiarities increased; he\r\nbecame more morose, more jealous. He was always unwilling to have even his\r\nmost intimate friends visit his studio, but he finally withdrew from his\r\nown house and home. Of late years he had frequently left his house for\r\nmonths at a time, and secreted himself in some distant quarter, taking\r\ncare that he should not be followed or known. When the great Exhibition of\r\n1851 opened, Turner left orders with his housekeeper that no one should be\r\nadmitted to see his pictures. For twenty years the rain had been streaming\r\nin upon them through the leaky roof, and many were hopelessly ruined. He\r\nsent no pictures to the exhibition of that year, and he was hardly to be\r\nrecognized when he appeared in the gallery. Finally his prolonged absence\r\nfrom the Academy meetings alarmed his friends; but no one dared seek him\r\nout. His housekeeper alone, of all that had known him, had the interest to\r\nhunt up the old artist. Taking a hint from a letter in one of his coats,\r\nshe went to Chelsea, and, after careful search, found his hiding-place,\r\nwith but one more day of life in him. It is said that, feeling the need of\r\npurer air than that of Queen Anne Street, he went out to Chelsea and found\r\nan eligible, little cottage by the side of the river, with a railed-in\r\nroof whence he could observe the sky. The landlady demanded references\r\nfrom the shabby, old man, when he testily replied, \"My good woman, I'll\r\nbuy the house outright.\" She then demanded his name--\"in case, sir, any\r\ngentleman should call, you know.\" \"Name?\" said he, \"what's your name?\" \"My\r\nname is Mrs. Booth.\" \"Then I am Mr. Booth.\" And so he was known, the boys\r\nalong the river-side calling him \"Puggy Booth,\" and the tradesmen \"Admiral\r\nBooth,\" the theory being that he was an old admiral in reduced\r\ncircumstances. In a low studded, attic room, poorly furnished, with a\r\nsingle roof window, the great artist was found in his mortal sickness. He\r\nsent for his favorite doctor from Margate, who frankly told him that death\r\nwas at hand. \"Go down stairs,\" exclaimed Turner, \"take a glass of sherry,\r\nand then look at me again.\" But no stimulant could change the verdict of\r\nthe physician. An hour before he died he was wheeled to the window for a\r\nlast look at the Thames, bathed in sunshine and dotted with sails. Up to\r\nthe last sickness the lonely, old man rose at daybreak to watch, from the\r\nroof of the cottage, the sun rise and the purple flush of the coming day.\r\nThe funeral, from the house in Queen Anne Street, was imposing, with a\r\nlong line of carriages, and conducted with the ritual of the English\r\nChurch in St. Paul's Cathedral. Dean Milman read the service, and at its\r\nconclusion the coffin was borne to the catacombs, and placed between the\r\ntombs of James Barry and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Turner's will, with its\r\ncodicils, was so confused and vague that the lawyers fought it in the\r\ncourts for four years, and it was finally settled by compromise. The real\r\nestate went to the heir-at-law, the pictures and drawings to the National\r\nGallery, one thousand pounds for a monument in St. Paul's Cathedral, and\r\ntwenty thousand pounds to the Royal Academy for annuities to poor artists.\r\nTurner's gift to the British nation included ninety-eight finished\r\npaintings and two hundred and seventy pictures in various stages of\r\nprogress. Ruskin, while arranging and classifying Turner's drawings, found\r\nmore than nineteen thousand sketches and fragments by the master's hand,\r\nsome covered with the dust of thirty years.\r\n\r\nSir DAVID WILKIE (1785-1841) has been called the \"prince of British\r\n_genre_ painters.\" His father was a minister, and David was placed in the\r\nTrustees' Academy in Edinburgh in 1799. In 1805 he entered the Royal\r\nAcademy in London, and was much noticed on account of his \"Village\r\nPoliticians,\" exhibited the next year. From this time his fame and\r\npopularity were established, and each new work was simply a new triumph\r\nfor him. The \"Card Players,\" \"Rent Day,\" the \"Village Festival,\" and\r\nothers were rapidly painted and exhibited.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Wilkie went to the Continent, and remained three years. He visited\r\nFrance, Germany, Italy, and Spain, and after his return he painted a new\r\nclass of subjects in a new manner. He made many portraits, and his other\r\nworks were historical subjects. His most celebrated works in this second\r\nmanner were \"John Knox Preaching,\" \"Napoleon and the Pope at\r\nFontainebleau,\" and \"Peep-o'-Day Boy's Cabin.\" The portrait of the\r\nlandscape painter William Daniell is a good picture.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Wilkie succeeded Sir Thomas Lawrence as painter to the king, as he\r\nhad been limner to the King of Scotland since 1822. He was not knighted\r\nuntil 1836. In 1840 he visited Constantinople, and made a portrait of the\r\nsultan; he went then to the Holy Land and Egypt. While at Alexandria, on\r\nhis way home, Wilkie complained of illness, and on shipboard, off\r\nGibraltar, he died, and was buried at sea. This burial is the subject of\r\none of Turner's pictures, and is now in the National Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe name of Landseer is an important one in British art. JOHN LANDSEER\r\n(1761-1852) was an eminent engraver; his son THOMAS (1795-1880) followed\r\nthe profession of his father and arrived at great celebrity in it.\r\nCHARLES, born in 1799, another son of John Landseer, became a painter and\r\ndevoted himself to a sort of historical genre line of subjects, such as\r\n\"Cromwell at the House of Sir Walter Stewart in 1651,\" \"Surrender of\r\nArundel Castle in 1643,\" and various others of a like nature. Charles\r\nLandseer travelled in Portugal and Brazil when a young man; he was made a\r\nmember of the Royal Academy in 1845; from 1851 to 1871 he was keeper of\r\nthe Academy, and has been an industrious and respected artist. But the\r\ngreat genius of the family was:\r\n\r\nSir EDWIN LANDSEER (1802-1873), the youngest son of John Landseer, the\r\nengraver. He received his first drawing lessons from his father, and from\r\na very early age showed a great talent for sketching and that love for the\r\nbrute creation which have been his chief characteristics as an artist. He\r\nhad the power to understand his dumb subjects as well as if they spoke\r\nsome language together, and then he had the ability to fix the meaning of\r\nall they had told him upon his canvas, by means of the sketching lines\r\nwhich gave the precise form of it all and by his finishing shades which\r\nput in the expression. If his animals were prosperous and gladsome, he\r\nrepresented their good fortune with hearty pleasure; if they were\r\nsuffering, sad, or bereaved, he painted their woes with a sympathy such as\r\nnone but a true friend can give.\r\n\r\nWhen Edwin and Thomas were old enough that their father thought other\r\ninstruction than his own should be given them, he placed them with Haydon,\r\nand in these early days the master predicted that Edwin Landseer would be\r\nthe Snyders of England. Edwin sent his first picture to the Royal Academy\r\nwhen he was but thirteen years old, and during the following fifty-eight\r\nyears there were but six exhibitions to which he did not contribute. When\r\nhe began his studies at the Royal Academy he was fourteen years old, and\r\nalready famous as an animal painter. He was a bright, curly-headed, manly\r\nlad, and the aged Fuseli, then keeper of the Academy, grew to be very fond\r\nof him; he would often ask, \"Where is my little dog-boy?\"\r\n\r\nEdwin Landseer now worked on diligently and quietly; his works were\r\nconstantly praised, and he received all the patronage that he desired.\r\nThrough the advice of his master, Haydon, he had the habit of dissecting\r\nanimals, and learning their anatomy with all the exactness with which\r\nother artists study that of human beings. About 1820 a lion died in the\r\nExeter Change Menagerie, and Edwin Landseer secured the body for\r\ndissection. He then painted three large pictures of lions, and during the\r\nyear in which he became eighteen years old, he exhibited these pictures\r\nand others of horses, dogs, donkeys, deer, goats, wolves, and vultures.\r\n\r\nWhen nineteen, in 1821, he painted \"Pointers, To-ho!\" a hunting scene,\r\nwhich was sold in 1872, the year before his death, for two thousand and\r\nsixteen pounds. In 1822 Landseer gained the prize of the British\r\nInstitution, one hundred and fifty pounds, by his picture of \"The Larder\r\nInvaded.\" He made the first sketch for this on a child's slate, which is\r\nstill preserved as a treasure. But the most famous of this master's early\r\nworks is the \"Cat's Paw,\" in which a monkey uses a cat's paw to draw\r\nchestnuts from a hot stove. Landseer was paid one hundred pounds; its\r\npresent value is three thousand pounds, and it is kept at the seat of the\r\nEarl of Essex, Cashiobury.\r\n\r\nThis picture of the \"Cat's Paw\" had an important result for the young\r\nartist, as it happened that it was exhibited when Sir Walter Scott was in\r\nLondon, and he was so much pleased with it that he made Landseer's\r\nacquaintance, and invited him to visit Abbotsford. Accordingly, in 1824,\r\nLandseer visited Sir Walter in company with Leslie, who then painted a\r\nportrait of the great novelist, which now belongs to the Ticknor family of\r\nBoston. It was at this time that Sir Walter wrote in his journal:\r\n\"Landseer's dogs were the most magnificent things I ever saw, leaping, and\r\nbounding, and grinning all over the canvas.\" Out of this visit came a\r\npicture called \"A Scene at Abbotsford,\" in which the dog Maida, so loved\r\nby Scott, was the prominent figure; six weeks after it was finished the\r\ndog died.\r\n\r\nAt this time Sir Walter was not known as the author of the \"Waverley\r\nNovels,\" but in later years Landseer painted a picture which he called\r\n\"Extract from a Journal whilst at Abbotsford,\" to which the following was\r\nattached: \"Found the great poet in his study, laughing at a collie dog\r\nplaying with Maida, his favorite old greyhound, given him by Glengarry,\r\nand quoting Shakespeare--'Crabbed old age and youth cannot agree.' On the\r\nfloor was the cover of a proof-sheet, sent for correction by Constable,\r\nof the novel then in progress. N. B.--This took place before he was the\r\nacknowledged author of the 'Waverley Novels.'\" Landseer early suspected\r\nScott of the authorship of the novels, and without doubt he came to this\r\nconclusion from what he saw at Abbotsford.\r\n\r\nLandseer repeated his visits to Scotland for many years, and saw all parts\r\nof that country at various seasons. From the time of his first visit there\r\nwas a new feeling in his works--a breadth and power was in them which he\r\ngained from nature, and a refinement and elevation which he undoubtedly\r\nreceived from his friendship with Sir Walter and the impetus it gave him.\r\nHe also became so interested in the Gaelic people that he painted good\r\npictures of them. At first these men did not know what to make of a\r\nhuntsman who would throw away his gun when fine game appeared, and draw\r\nout pencils and paper to make pictures of what others were so eager to\r\nshoot. This tendency made him a poor hunter; but he was intensely\r\ninterested in the chase, and especially in deer-stalking. He insisted that\r\ndeer had intelligence, and the question was whether the game or the hunter\r\nhappened to have the superior mind. When in London the artist was a quiet,\r\nsociety gentleman; but each year he broke away from all city habits, and\r\nwent to the Highlands, where he divided his days between the chase and\r\npainting portraits of his friends there with their children and pets, or\r\nputting frescoes on the walls of their houses.\r\n\r\nLandseer continued to live in his father's house long after he was a\r\nfamous man. The senior artist conducted all business matters--sold\r\npictures, and took the money for them as if his son was still a boy. At\r\nlength, through the advice of a friend, Edwin Landseer removed to No. 1\r\nSt. John's Wood Road, to which he gave the name of Maida Vale; he\r\nenlarged, and improved this home from time to time, and had no other for\r\nnearly fifty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--THE EAGLE AND DEAD STAG. _By Landseer._]\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Landseer painted \"Chevy Chase;\" it was the only historical\r\npainting he ever did, and still remains at Woburn Abbey, where it\r\noriginally went. The animals in the picture are excellent of course, but\r\nthis sort of painting was not that in which Landseer showed his best. This\r\nyear of 1826 was an important one to this master. He was twenty-four years\r\nold, and was immediately admitted an Associate of the Royal Academy. No\r\none can be a candidate for this honor at a younger age, and very few\r\nothers have attained it so early. Before he was thirty Landseer was a full\r\nmember, and his diploma picture, \"The Dead Warrior\" is in the Royal\r\nAcademy. But this year saw a great change in his pictures, as may be seen\r\nin that of \"The Chief's Return from Deer-stalking,\" which he sent to the\r\nnext exhibition. It was free, broad, and effective beyond any previous\r\nwork, and this manner was his best. Many judges fix the year 1834 as the\r\nvery prime in the art of Landseer, and one of the works of that year,\r\ncalled \"Bolton Abbey in the Olden Time,\" is very famous. It represents the\r\nvassals of the abbey bringing in their tributes of game, fish, and fruits,\r\nwhich the jolly, old monks gladly receive.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that Landseer's best pictures are of dogs, and we\r\ncan but echo the words of Hamerton when he says: \"The best commentators on\r\nLandseer, the best defenders of his genius, are the dogs themselves; and\r\nso long as there exist terriers, deer-hounds, blood-hounds, his fame will\r\nneed little assistance from writers on art.\"\r\n\r\nLandseer had a long and happy intimacy with Queen Victoria and the royal\r\nfamily. He painted portraits of the various members of the queen's\r\nhousehold in all possible ways, with dogs and on horseback, in fancy dress\r\nand hunting costume--in short, these portraits are far too numerous to be\r\nmentioned in detail. Ever after 1835 Landseer was called upon to paint\r\npictures of the pets of the royal family, and these works became very\r\nnumerous. While he was thus favored as an artist he was also a friend of\r\nthe queen and her immediate family; he was often summoned to play\r\nbilliards with Prince Albert. The queen's Journal of Life in the Highlands\r\nfrequently mentions him, and we are sure that if we could read Landseer's\r\ndiary it would tell us many interesting things of the queen and her\r\nfamily. Naturally it followed that an artist thus favored by the queen\r\nwould be patronized by the nobility, and it is true that much of\r\nLandseer's time, both as an artist and as a gentleman of society, was\r\npassed in the company of people of the highest positions in Great Britain;\r\nand with the one exception of Sir Joshua Reynolds, no artist in England\r\nwas ever visited by so many people of rank. His house was really a social\r\ncentre, and no one felt above accepting his hasty invitations to his\r\nparties, which were almost always gotten up on an impulse and the guests\r\ninvited at the last possible moment.\r\n\r\nAmong Landseer's friends were Dickens and Thackeray, and Sydney Smith was\r\nvery fond of the artist; and it is said that when the great wit was asked\r\nto sit to Landseer for his portrait, he replied in the words of the\r\nhaughty Syrian: \"Is thy servant a _dog_ that he should do this thing?\"\r\n\r\nWhen at his best Landseer had a facility in drawing and painting that was\r\nmarvellous. He could draw two entirely different objects at the same\r\nmoment, his left hand being equally skilful with the right. He was seen to\r\ndraw a horse's head with one hand and a stag's head with antlers at\r\nexactly the same time--and this at an evening party to prove that it could\r\nbe done. He once sent to an exhibition a picture of rabbits under which he\r\nwrote, \"Painted in three-quarters of an hour.\" He painted a life-size\r\npicture of a fallow-deer in three hours, and it required no retouching.\r\nOne of his comrades said: \"Sir Edwin has a fine hand, a correct eye,\r\nrefined perceptions, and can do almost anything but dance on the slack\r\nwire. He is a fine billiard player, plays at chess, sings when with his\r\nintimate friends, and has considerable humor.\"\r\n\r\nWe have passed over the best and most pleasant part of the life of this\r\ngreat painter, for in 1840 he had an attack of illness from which he never\r\nrecovered. He travelled, and endeavored in every way to go on with his\r\nwork; but he was always subject to attacks of depression which were\r\nsometimes so serious that his friends feared loss of reason. Of course\r\nthere was a different tone in his works--a seriousness and pathos, and at\r\ntimes a religious element, which was very acceptable to some persons, and\r\nhe gained admirers where he had not found them before. But it can scarcely\r\nbe said that his last days were his best days, though he executed some\r\nfamous pictures.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 he exhibited a model of a stag at bay which was afterward cast in\r\nbronze. The lions at the base of the Nelson monument in Trafalgar Square\r\nmay be called the work of Sir Edwin, for he modelled one of the colossal\r\nbeasts from which the others were formed with but slight changes, and the\r\nwhole were cast under the care of Baron Marochetti.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 he painted \"The Font,\" which is a religious subject. It represents\r\nthe sheep and lambs of the Gospel gathering round a font, upon the edge of\r\nwhich are doves. A rainbow spans the sky; on the sides of the font are a\r\nmask of the face of Christ and the symbols of the Atonement. This is a\r\npainful picture, for while it is exquisite in conception its execution\r\nshows the weakness of the painter, who so soon after he made it was\r\nreleased from all his darkness and suffering.\r\n\r\nSir Edwin Landseer was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral with all the honors\r\nwhich his genius and character merited. His works are known to almost\r\nevery child in America by means of the engravings which have been made\r\nfrom them. His brother Thomas engraved hundreds of the designs of Edwin\r\nand made them popular all over the world, and a large part of this success\r\nwas due to the skill and sympathy which Thomas devoted to what was largely\r\na work of love. Of course many other engravers have worked after Landseer,\r\nand almost all his pictures have been reproduced in one style of engraving\r\nor another.\r\n\r\nThere are nine portraits of Sir Edwin Landseer in existence--one by J.\r\nHayter when Landseer was thirteen years old and is represented as a\r\ncricketer; one painted a year later by Leslie, in which Edwin Landseer is\r\nthe Rutland in the work called \"Henry VI.\" It is owned by the Philadelphia\r\nAcademy. The next were not made until 1843, when Count d'Orsay painted two\r\nportraits of him; in 1830 Dupper had made a drawing, and in 1835 a\r\nphotograph was taken; Baron Marochetti made a bust portrait of Landseer\r\nwhich is in the Royal Academy, and in his picture called the\r\n\"Connoisseurs\" Sir Edwin painted his own portrait, with dogs on each side\r\nwho stand as critics of his work. This was painted in 1865.\r\n\r\nSir Edwin Landseer left an estate of two hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds, and the works unsold at his death brought about seventy thousand\r\npounds. His will made but a few bequests, and the remainder of this large\r\nsum was divided between his brother and three sisters. With the account of\r\nSir Edwin I shall close the account of painters given in this volume.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how few actual remains of the painting of ancient nations are\r\nnow in existence. Almost nothing is left even from the times of the\r\nGreeks; in truth, there is more upon the tombs of Egypt than in the land\r\nof Hellas. We read accounts of classic painting which arouse our deepest\r\ninterest one moment, only to remember in the next that we can see but the\r\nmerest scraps of all this wealth of beauty which moved the cultured Greeks\r\nto write of it with such enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAfter the days of classic art we have endeavored to trace painting through\r\na period when it could scarcely be termed an art, so little of it was\r\ndone, and that little was so far below our ideal. Again, this decline was\r\nfollowed by a Renaissance--an awakening--and from that day in the\r\nfourteenth century when the Madonna of Cimabue was carried in triumph\r\nthrough the streets of Florence, this art moved on with progressive steps\r\nuntil Michael Angelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian, and others highly gifted,\r\nhad set up the standards which have remained as beacons and guides to all\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIn tracing this progress we have seen that Italy, the German nations,\r\nSpain, France, and England have all striven to dream dreams of beauty and\r\ngrandeur, of tenderness and love, and to fix them in fitting colors where\r\nall the world could see them.\r\n\r\nThe past is always fascinating. No stories are so pleasantly begun as\r\nthose that say, \"A long time ago there lived,\" etc. One can have the most\r\ncomplete satisfaction in the study of what has happened so far in the past\r\nthat we can see all its effects and judge of it by the tests which time is\r\nsure to bring to everything. It is such a study that has been made in\r\nthese pages, and I would suggest that it has a second use scarcely less\r\nimportant than the study of history--that is, the preparation it affords\r\nfor judging of what is done in the present. A knowledge of what has been\r\nachieved enables us by comparison to decide upon the merits of new works.\r\n\r\nThe painting of to-day offers an immense field for investigation. When we\r\nremember that five centuries ago the painters of the world could be\r\ncounted by tens, and are told that now there is an average of twenty-five\r\nhundred painters in some foreign cities, we see that a lifetime is\r\nscarcely sufficient in which to study the painting of our own era.\r\n\r\nHave we not reason to hope that works are now being produced which shall\r\nbe studied and admired in the future as we study and admire those of the\r\npast? Is it not true that the artistic works of any period show forth the\r\nspirit of the time? If, then, the close of the Dark Ages and the dawn of a\r\nbetter life could bring forth the treasures which remain from those days,\r\nwhat ought to be the result of the more universal learning and the\r\nadvancing civilization of the nineteenth century? And so, in leaving this\r\nbook, I hope that it may be useful to all who read it for one purpose that\r\nI have suggested or the other; either to present an outline of what has\r\nbeen done in the past, or aid in the understanding of the painting of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nBY L.
