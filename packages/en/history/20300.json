(p. v)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a matter rather for regret than for surprise that so few\r\nattempts have been made to describe, as a whole, the life and\r\ncharacter of Henry VIII. No ruler has left a deeper impress on the\r\nhistory of his country, or done work which has been the subject of\r\nmore keen and lasting contention. Courts of law are still debating the\r\nintention of statutes, the tenor of which he dictated; and the moral,\r\npolitical, and religious, are as much in dispute as the legal, results\r\nof his reign. He is still the Great Erastian, the protagonist of laity\r\nagainst clergy. His policy is inextricably interwoven with the high\r\nand eternal dilemma of Church and State; and it is well-nigh\r\nimpossible for one who feels keenly on these questions to treat the\r\nreign of Henry VIII. in a reasonably judicial spirit. No period\r\nillustrates more vividly the contradiction between morals and\r\npolitics. In our desire to reprobate the immorality of Henry's\r\nmethods, we are led to deny their success; or, in our appreciation of\r\nthe greatness of the ends he achieved, we seek to excuse the means he\r\ntook to achieve them. As with his policy, so with his character.    (p. vi)\r\nThere was nothing commonplace about him; his good and his bad\r\nqualities alike were exceptional. It is easy, by suppressing the one\r\nor the other, to paint him a hero or a villain. He lends himself\r\nreadily to polemic; but to depict his character in all its varied\r\naspects, extenuating nothing nor setting down aught in malice, is a\r\ntask of no little difficulty. It is two centuries and a half since\r\nLord Herbert produced his _Life and Reign of Henry VIII_.[1] The late\r\nMr. Brewer, in his prefaces to the first four volumes of the _Letters\r\nand Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII._, published under the direction\r\nof the Master of the Rolls, dealt adequately with the earlier portion\r\nof Henry's career. But Mr. Brewer died when his work reached the year\r\n1530; his successor, Dr. James Gairdner, was directed to confine his\r\nprefaces to the later volumes within the narrowest possible limits;\r\nand students of history were deprived of the prospect of a\r\nsatisfactory account of Henry's later years from a writer of\r\nunrivalled learning.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1: The edition cited in the text is that\r\n                   of 1672.]\r\n\r\nHenry's reign, from 1530 onwards, has been described by the late Mr.\r\nFroude in one of the most brilliant and fascinating masterpieces of\r\nhistorical literature, a work which still holds the field in popular,\r\nif not in scholarly, estimation. But Mr. Froude does not begin until\r\nHenry's reign was half over, until his character had been determined\r\nby influences and events which lie outside the scope of Mr.        (p. vii)\r\nFroude's inquiry. Moreover, since Mr. Froude wrote, a flood of light\r\nhas been thrown on the period by the publication of the above-mentioned\r\n_Letters and Papers_;[2] they already comprise a summary of between\r\nthirty and forty thousand documents in twenty thousand closely printed\r\npages, and, when completed, will constitute the most magnificent body\r\nof materials for the history of any reign, ancient or modern, English\r\nor foreign. Simultaneously there have appeared a dozen volumes\r\ncontaining the State papers preserved at Simancas,[3] Vienna and\r\nBrussels and similar series comprising the correspondence relating to\r\nVenice,[4] Scotland[5] and Ireland;[6] while the despatches of French\r\nambassadors have been published under the auspices of the Ministry for\r\nForeign Affairs at Paris.[7] Still further information has been   (p. viii)\r\nprovided by the labours of the Historical Manuscripts Commission,[8]\r\nthe Camden,[9] the Royal Historical,[10] and other learned Societies.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2: This series, unlike the _Calendars of\r\n                   State Papers_, includes documents not preserved at\r\n                   the Record Office; it is often inaccurately cited\r\n                   as _Calendar of State Papers_, but the word\r\n                   \"Calendar\" does not appear in the title and it\r\n                   includes much besides State papers; such a\r\n                   description also tends to confuse it with the\r\n                   eleven volumes of Henry VIII.'s State papers\r\n                   published _in extenso_ in 1830-51. The series now\r\n                   extends to Dec., 1544, and is cited in the text as\r\n                   _L. and P._.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3: Cited as _Spanish Calendar_; the\r\n                   volume completing Henry's reign was published in\r\n                   1904.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4: Cited as _Ven. Cal._; this\r\n                   correspondence diminishes in importance as the\r\n                   reign proceeds, and also, after 1530, the documents\r\n                   are epitomised afresh in _L. and P._.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5: Three series, _viz._, that edited by\r\n                   Thorp (2 vols., 1858), a second edited by Bain (2\r\n                   vols., 1898) and the _Hamilton Papers_ (2 vols.,\r\n                   1890-92).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6: Vol. i. of the _Irish Calendar_, and\r\n                   also of the _Carew MSS._; see also the _Calendar of\r\n                   Fiants_ published by the Deputy-Keeper of Records\r\n                   for Ireland.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7: _Correspondance de MM. Castillon et\r\n                   Marillac_, edited by Kaulek, and of _Odet de\r\n                   Selve_, 1888.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8: The most important of these is vol. i.\r\n                   of Lord Salisbury's MSS.; other papers of Henry\r\n                   VIII.'s reign are scattered up and down the\r\n                   Appendices to a score and more of reports.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9: _E.g._, Wriothesley's _Chronicle_,\r\n                   _Chron. of Calais_, and _Greyfriars Chron_.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10: _E.g._, Leadam, _Domesday of\r\n                   Inclosures_, and _Transactions_, _passim_.]\r\n\r\nThese sources probably contain at least a million definite facts\r\nrelating to the reign of Henry VIII.; and it is obvious that the task\r\nof selection has become heavy as well as invidious. Mr. Froude has\r\nexpressed his concurrence in the dictum that the facts of history are\r\nlike the letters of the alphabet; by selection and arrangement they\r\ncan be made to spell anything, and nothing can be arranged so easily\r\nas facts. _Experto crede_. Yet selection is inevitable, and\r\narrangement essential. The historian has no option if he wishes to be\r\nintelligible. He will naturally arrange his facts so that they spell\r\nwhat he believes to be the truth; and he must of necessity suppress\r\nthose facts which he judges to be immaterial or inconsistent with the\r\nscale on which he is writing. But if the superabundance of facts\r\ncompels both selection and suppression, it counsels no less a\r\nrestraint of judgment. A case in a court of law is not simplified by a\r\ncloud of witnesses; and the new wealth of contemporary evidence     (p. ix)\r\ndoes not solve the problems of Henry's reign. It elucidates some\r\npoints hitherto obscure, but it raises a host of others never before\r\nsuggested. In ancient history we often accept statements written\r\nhundreds of years after the event, simply because we know no better;\r\nin modern history we frequently have half a dozen witnesses giving\r\ninconsistent accounts of what they have seen with their own eyes.\r\nDogmatism is merely the result of ignorance; and no honest historian\r\nwill pretend to have mastered all the facts, accurately weighed all\r\nthe evidence, or pronounced a final judgment.\r\n\r\nThe present volume does not profess to do more than roughly sketch\r\nHenry VIII.'s more prominent characteristics, outline the chief\r\nfeatures of his policy, and suggest some reasons for the measure of\r\nsuccess he attained. Episodes such as the divorce of Catherine of\r\nAragon, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the determination of\r\nthe relations between Church and State, would severally demand for\r\nadequate treatment works of much greater bulk than the present. On the\r\ndivorce valuable light has recently been thrown by Dr. Stephan Ehses\r\nin his _Roemische Dokumente_.[11] The dissolution of the monasteries\r\nhas been exhaustively treated from one point of view by Dr. Gasquet;[12]\r\nbut an adequate and impartial history of what is called the Reformation\r\nstill remains to be written. Here it is possible to deal with        (p. x)\r\nthese questions only in the briefest outline, and in so far as they\r\nwere affected by Henry's personal action. For my facts I have relied\r\nentirely on contemporary records, and my deductions from these facts\r\nare my own. I have depended as little as possible even on contemporary\r\nhistorians,[13] and scarcely at all on later writers.[14] I have,\r\nhowever, made frequent use of Dr. Gairdner's articles in the _Dictionary\r\nof National Biography_, particularly of that on Henry VIII., the best\r\nsummary extant of his career; and I owe not a little to Bishop\r\nStubbs's two lectures on Henry VIII., which contain some fruitful\r\nsuggestions as to his character.[15]\r\n                                                  A.F.

(p. 001)\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY TUDORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the whole range of English history there is no monarch whose\r\ncharacter has been more variously depicted by contemporaries or more\r\nstrenuously debated by posterity than the \"majestic lord who broke the\r\nbonds of Rome\". To one historian an inhuman embodiment of cruelty and\r\nvice, to another a superhuman incarnation of courage, wisdom and\r\nstrength of will, Henry VIII. has, by an almost universal consent,\r\nbeen placed above or below the grade of humanity. So unique was his\r\npersonality, so singular his achievements, that he appears in the\r\nlight of a special dispensation sent like another Attila to be the\r\nscourge of mankind, or like a second Hercules to cleanse, or at least\r\nto demolish, Augean stables. The dictates of his will seemed as\r\ninexorable as the decrees of fate, and the history of his reign is\r\nstrewn with records of the ruin of those who failed to placate his\r\nwrath. Of the six queens he married, two he divorced, and two he\r\nbeheaded. Four English cardinals[16] lived in his reign; one perished\r\nby the executioner's axe, one escaped it by absence, and a third   (p. 002)\r\nby a timely but natural death. Of a similar number of dukes[17] half\r\nwere condemned by attainder; and the same method of speedy despatch\r\naccounted for six or seven earls and viscounts and for scores of\r\nlesser degree. He began his reign by executing the ministers of his\r\nfather,[18] he continued it by sending his own to the scaffold. The\r\nTower of London was both palace and prison, and statesmen passed\r\nswiftly from one to the other; in silent obscurity alone lay\r\nsalvation. Religion and politics, rank and profession made little\r\ndifference; priest and layman, cardinal-archbishop and \"hammer of the\r\nmonks,\" men whom Henry had raised from the mire, and peers, over whose\r\nheads they were placed, were joined in a common fate. Wolsey and More,\r\nCromwell and Norfolk, trod the same dizzy path to the same fatal end;\r\nand the English people looked on powerless or unmoved. They sent their\r\nburgesses and knights of the shire to Westminster without let or\r\nhindrance, and Parliament met with a regularity that grew with the\r\nrigour of Henry's rule; but it seemed to assemble only to register the\r\nroyal edicts and clothe with a legal cloak the naked violence of\r\nHenry's acts. It remembered its privileges only to lay them at Henry's\r\nfeet, it cancelled his debts, endowed his proclamations with the force\r\nof laws, and authorised him to repeal acts of attainder and dispose of\r\nhis crown at will. Secure of its support Henry turned and rent the\r\nspiritual unity of Western Christendom, and settled at a blow that\r\nperennial struggle between Church and State, in which kings and    (p. 003)\r\nemperors had bitten the dust. With every epithet of contumely and\r\nscorn he trampled under foot the jurisdiction of him who was believed\r\nto hold the keys of heaven and hell. Borrowing in practice the old\r\nmaxim of Roman law, _cujus regio, ejus religio_,[19] he placed himself\r\nin the seat of authority in religion and presumed to define the faith\r\nof which Leo had styled him defender. Others have made themselves\r\ndespots by their mastery of many legions, through the agency of a\r\nsecret police, or by means of an organised bureaucracy. Yet Henry's\r\nstanding army consisted of a few gentlemen pensioners and yeomen of\r\nthe guard; he had neither secret police nor organised bureaucracy.\r\nEven then Englishmen boasted that they were not slaves like the\r\nFrench,[20] and foreigners pointed a finger of scorn at their turbulence.\r\nHad they not permanently or temporarily deprived of power nearly half\r\ntheir kings who had reigned since William the Conqueror? Yet Henry\r\nVIII. not only left them their arms, but repeatedly urged them to keep\r\nthose arms ready for use.[21] He eschewed that air of mystery with\r\nwhich tyrants have usually sought to impose on the mind of the people.\r\nAll his life he moved familiarly and almost unguarded in the midst of\r\nhis subjects, and he died in his bed, full of years, with the spell of\r\nhis power unbroken and the terror of his name unimpaired.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16: Bainbridge, Wolsey, Fisher, Pole.\r\n                   Bainbridge was a cardinal after Julius II's own\r\n                   heart, and he received the red hat for military\r\n                   services rendered to that warlike Pope (_Ven.\r\n                   Cal._, ii., 104).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17: There were two Dukes of Norfolk, the\r\n                   second of whom was attainted, as was the Duke of\r\n                   Buckingham; the fourth Duke was Henry's\r\n                   brother-in-law, Suffolk.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18: Empson and Dudley.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19: \"Sua cuique civitati religio est,\r\n                   nostra nobis.\" Cicero, _Pro Flacco_, 28; _cf._ E.\r\n                   Bourre, _Des Inequalites de condition resultant de\r\n                   la religion en droit Romain_, Paris, 1895.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20: _Cf._ Bishop Scory to Edward VI. in\r\n                   Strype, _Eccl.

Is recourse necessary to a theory of supernatural agency, or\r\nis there another and adequate solution? Was Henry's individual will of\r\nsuch miraculous force that he could ride roughshod in insolent pride\r\nover public opinion at home and abroad? Or did his personal ends,\r\ndictated perhaps by selfish motives and ignoble passions, so far\r\ncoincide with the interests and prejudices of the politically\r\neffective portion of his people, that they were willing to condone a\r\nviolence and tyranny, the brunt of which fell after all on the few?\r\nSuch is the riddle which propounds itself to every student of Tudor\r\nhistory. It cannot be answered by paeans in honour of Henry's intensity\r\nof will and force of character, nor by invectives against his vices\r\nand lamentations over the woes of his victims. The miraculous\r\ninterpretation of history is as obsolete as the catastrophic theory of\r\ngeology, and the explanation of Henry's career must be sought not so\r\nmuch in the study of his character as in the study of his environment,\r\nof the conditions which made things possible to him that were not\r\npossible before or since and are not likely to be so again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a singular circumstance that the king who raised the personal\r\npower of English monarchy to a height to which it had never before\r\nattained, should have come of humble race and belonged to an upstart\r\ndynasty. For three centuries and a half before the battle of Bosworth\r\none family had occupied the English throne. Even the usurpers, Henry\r\nof Bolingbroke and Richard of York, were directly descended in unbroken\r\nmale line from Henry II., and from 1154 to 1485 all the sovereigns of\r\nEngland were Plantagenets. But who were the Tudors? They were a    (p. 005)\r\nWelsh family of modest means and doubtful antecedents.[22] They\r\nclaimed, it is true, descent from Cadwallader, and their pedigree was\r\nas long and quite as veracious as most Welsh genealogies; but Henry\r\nVII.'s great-grandfather was steward or butler to the Bishop of\r\nBangor. His son, Owen Tudor, came as a young man to seek his fortune\r\nat the Court of Henry V., and obtained a clerkship of the wardrobe to\r\nHenry's Queen, Catherine of France. So skilfully did he use or abuse\r\nthis position of trust, that he won the heart of his mistress; and\r\nwithin a few years of Henry's death his widowed Queen and her clerk of\r\nthe wardrobe were secretly, and possibly without legal sanction,\r\nliving together as man and wife. The discovery of their relations\r\nresulted in Catherine's retirement to Bermondsey Abbey, and Owen's to\r\nNewgate prison. The Queen died in the following year, but Owen\r\nsurvived many romantic adventures. Twice he escaped from prison, twice\r\nhe was recaptured. Once he took sanctuary in the precincts of\r\nWestminster Abbey, and various attempts to entrap him were made by\r\nenticing him to revels in a neighbouring tavern. Finally, on the\r\noutbreak of the Wars of the Roses, he espoused the Lancastrian cause,\r\nand was beheaded by order of Edward IV. after the battle of Mortimer's\r\nCross. Two sons, Edmund and Jasper, were born of this singular match\r\nbetween Queen and clerk of her wardrobe. Both enjoyed the favour of\r\ntheir royal half-brother, Henry VI. Edmund, the elder, was first\r\nknighted and then created Earl of Richmond. In the Parliament of 1453,\r\nhe was formally declared legitimate; he was enriched by the grant of\r\nbroad estates and enrolled among the members of Henry's council.   (p. 006)\r\nBut the climax of his fortunes was reached when, in 1455, he married\r\nthe Lady Margaret Beaufort. Owen Tudor had taken the first step which\r\nled to his family's greatness; Edmund took the second. The blood-royal\r\nof France flowed in his veins, the blood-royal of England was to flow\r\nin his children's; and the union between Edmund Tudor and Margaret\r\nBeaufort gave Henry VII. such claim as he had by descent to the\r\nEnglish throne.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22: _Archaeologia Cambrensis_, 1st ser.,\r\n                   iv., 267; 3rd ser., xv., 278, 379.]\r\n\r\nThe Beauforts were descended from Edward III., but a bar sinister\r\nmarred their royal pedigree. John of Gaunt had three sons by Catherine\r\nSwynford before she became his wife. That marriage would, by canon\r\nlaw, have made legitimate the children, but the barons had, on a\r\nfamous occasion, refused to assimilate in this respect the laws of\r\nEngland to the canons of the Church; and it required a special Act of\r\nParliament to confer on the Beauforts the status of legitimacy. When\r\nHenry IV. confirmed this Act, he introduced a clause specifically\r\nbarring their contingent claim to the English throne. This limitation\r\ncould not legally abate the force of a statute; but it sufficed to\r\ncast a doubt upon the Beaufort title, and has been considered a\r\nsufficient explanation of Henry VII.'s reluctance to base his claim\r\nupon hereditary right. However that may be, the Beauforts played no\r\nlittle part in the English history of the fifteenth century; their\r\ninfluence was potent for peace or war in the councils of their royal\r\nhalf-brother, Henry IV., and of the later sovereigns of the House of\r\nLancaster. One was Cardinal-Bishop of Winchester, another was Duke of\r\nExeter, and a third was Earl of Somerset. Two of the sons of the Earl\r\nbecame Dukes of Somerset; the younger fell at St. Albans, the      (p. 007)\r\nearliest victim of the Wars of the Roses, which proved so fatal to\r\nhis House; and the male line of the Beauforts failed in the third\r\ngeneration. The sole heir to their claims was the daughter of the\r\nfirst Duke of Somerset, Margaret, now widow of Edmund Tudor; for,\r\nafter a year of wedded life, Edmund had died in November, 1456. Two\r\nmonths later his widow gave birth to a boy, the future Henry VII.;\r\nand, incredible as the fact may seem, the youthful mother was not\r\nquite fourteen years old. When fifteen more years had passed, the\r\nmurder of Henry VI. and his son left Margaret Beaufort and Henry Tudor\r\nin undisputed possession of the Lancastrian title. A barren honour it\r\nseemed. Edward IV. was firmly seated on the English throne. His right\r\nto it, by every test, was immeasurably superior to the Tudor claim,\r\nand Henry showed no inclination and possessed not the means to dispute\r\nit. The usurpation by Richard III., and the crimes which polluted his\r\nreign, put a different aspect on the situation, and set men seeking\r\nfor an alternative to the blood-stained tyrant. The battle of Bosworth\r\nfollowed, and the last of the Plantagenets gave way to the first of\r\nthe Tudors.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, since the Norman Conquest, a king of decisively\r\nBritish blood sat on the English throne. His lineage was, indeed,\r\nEnglish in only a minor degree; but England might seem to have lost at\r\nthe battle of Hastings her right to native kings; and Norman were\r\nsucceeded by Angevin, Angevin by Welsh, Welsh by Scots, and Scots by\r\nHanoverian sovereigns. The Tudors were probably more at home on the\r\nEnglish throne than most of England's kings; and their humble and\r\nBritish origin may have contributed to their unique capacity for   (p. 008)\r\nunderstanding the needs, and expressing the mind, of the English\r\nnation. It was well for them that they established their throne in the\r\nhearts of their people, for no dynasty grasped the sceptre with less\r\nof hereditary right. Judged by that criterion, there were many\r\nclaimants whose titles must have been preferred to Henry's. There were\r\nthe daughters of Edward IV. and the children of George, Duke of\r\nClarence; and their existence may account for Henry's neglect to press\r\nhis hereditary claim. But there was a still better reason. Supposing\r\nthe Lancastrian case to be valid and the Beauforts to be the true\r\nLancastrian heirs, even so the rightful occupant of the throne was not\r\nHenry VII., but his mother, Margaret Beaufort. England had never\r\nrecognised a Salic law at home; on occasion she had disputed its\r\nvalidity abroad. But Henry VII. was not disposed to let his mother\r\nrule; she could not unite the Yorkist and Lancastrian claims by\r\nmarriage, and, in addition to other disabilities, she had a second\r\nhusband in Lord Stanley, who might demand the crown matrimonial. So\r\nHenry VII.'s hereditary title was judiciously veiled in vague\r\nobscurity. Parliament wisely admitted the accomplished fact and\r\nrecognised that the crown was vested in him, without rashly venturing\r\nupon the why or the wherefore. He had in truth been raised to the\r\nthrone because men were weary of Richard. He was chosen to vindicate\r\nno theory of hereditary or other abstract right, but to govern with a\r\nfirm hand, to establish peace within his gates and give prosperity to\r\nhis people. That was the true Tudor title, and, as a rule, they\r\nremembered the fact; they were _de facto_ kings, and they left the _de\r\njure_ arguments to the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nPeace, however, could not be obtained at once, nor the embers of   (p. 009)\r\nthirty years' strife stamped out in a moment. For fifteen years\r\nopen revolt and whispered sedition troubled the rest of the realm and\r\nthreatened the stability of Henry's throne. Ireland remained a hot-bed\r\nof Yorkist sympathies, and Ireland was zealously aided by Edward IV.'s\r\nsister, Margaret of Burgundy; she pursued, like a vendetta, the family\r\nquarrel with Henry VII., and earned the title of Henry's Juno by\r\nharassing him as vindictively as the Queen of Heaven vexed the pious\r\nAEneas. Other rulers, with no Yorkist bias, were slow to recognise the\r\n_parvenu_ king and quick to profit by his difficulties. Pretenders to\r\ntheir rivals' thrones were useful pawns on the royal chess-board; and\r\nthough the princes of Europe had no reason to desire a Yorkist\r\nrestoration, they thought that a little judicious backing of Yorkist\r\nclaimants would be amply repaid by the restriction of Henry's energies\r\nto domestic affairs. Seven months after the battle of Bosworth there\r\nwas a rising in the West under the Staffords, and in the North under\r\nLovell; and Henry himself was nearly captured while celebrating at\r\nYork the feast of St. George. A year later a youth of obscure origin,\r\nLambert Simnel,[23] claimed to be first the Duke of York and then the\r\nEarl of Warwick. The former was son, and the latter was nephew, of\r\nEdward IV. Lambert was crowned king at Dublin amid the acclamations of\r\nthe Irish people. Not a voice was raised in Henry's favour; Kildare,\r\nthe practical ruler of Ireland, earls and archbishops, bishops and\r\nbarons, and great officers of State, from Lord Chancellor downwards,\r\nswore fealty to the reputed son of an Oxford tradesman. Ireland was\r\nonly the volcano which gave vent to the subterranean flood;        (p. 010)\r\ntreason in England and intrigue abroad were working in secret concert\r\nwith open rebellion across St. George's Channel. The Queen Dowager was\r\nsecluded in Bermondsey Abbey and deprived of her jointure lands. John\r\nde la Pole, who, as eldest son of Edward IV.'s sister, had been named\r\nhis successor by Richard III., fled to Burgundy; thence his aunt\r\nMargaret sent Martin Schwartz and two thousand mercenaries to co-operate\r\nwith the Irish invasion. But, at East Stoke, De la Pole and Lovell,\r\nMartin Schwartz and his merry men were slain; and the most serious of\r\nthe revolts against Henry ended in the consignment of Simnel to the\r\nroyal scullery and of his tutor to the Tower.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23: See the present writer in _D.N.B._,\r\n                   lii., 261.]\r\n\r\nLambert, however, was barely initiated in his new duties when the son\r\nof a boatman of Tournay started on a similar errand with a less\r\ncongenial end. An unwilling puppet at first, Perkin Warbeck was on a\r\ntrading visit to Ireland, when the Irish, who saw a Yorkist prince in\r\nevery likely face, insisted that Perkin was Earl of Warwick. This he\r\ndenied on oath before the Mayor of Cork. Nothing deterred, they\r\nsuggested that he was Richard III.'s bastard; but the bastard was safe\r\nin Henry's keeping, and the imaginative Irish finally took refuge in\r\nthe theory that Perkin was Duke of York. Lambert's old friends rallied\r\nround Perkin; the re-animated Duke was promptly summoned to the Court\r\nof France and treated with princely honours. When Charles VIII. had\r\nused him to beat down Henry's terms, Perkin found a home with\r\nMargaret, aunt to all the pretenders. As usual, there were traitors in\r\nhigh places in England. Sir William Stanley, whose brother had married\r\nHenry's mother, and to whom Henry himself owed his victory at      (p. 011)\r\nBosworth, was implicated. His sudden arrest disconcerted the plot,\r\nand when Perkin's fleet appeared off the coast of Kent, the rustics\r\nmade short work of the few who were rash enough to land. Perkin sailed\r\naway to the Yorkist refuge in Ireland, but Kildare was no longer\r\ndeputy. Waterford, to which he laid siege, was relieved, and the\r\npretender sought in Scotland a third basis of operations. An abortive\r\nraid on the Borders and a high-born Scottish wife[24] were all that he\r\nobtained of James IV., and in 1497, after a second attempt in Ireland,\r\nhe landed in Cornwall. The Cornishmen had just risen against Henry's\r\nextortions, marched on London and been defeated at Blackheath; but\r\nHenry's lenience encouraged a fresh revolt, and three thousand men\r\nflocked to Perkin's standard. They failed to take Exeter; Perkin was\r\nseized at Beaulieu and sent up to London to be paraded through the\r\nstreets amid the jeers and taunts of the people. Two years later a\r\nfoolish attempt at escape and a fresh personation of the Earl of\r\nWarwick by one Ralf Wulford[25] led to the execution of all three,\r\nPerkin, Wulford, and the real Earl of Warwick, who had been a prisoner\r\nand probably the innocent centre of so many plots since the accession\r\nof Henry VII. Warwick's death may have been due to the instigation of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella of Spain, who were negotiating for the marriage\r\nof Catherine of Aragon with Prince Arthur. They were naturally anxious\r\nfor the security of the throne their daughter was to share with    (p. 012)\r\nHenry's son; and now their ambassador wrote triumphantly that there\r\nremained in England not a doubtful drop of royal blood.[26] There were\r\nno more pretenders, and for the rest of Henry's reign England enjoyed\r\nsuch peace as it had not known for nearly a century. The end which\r\nHenry had sought by fair means and foul was attained, and there was no\r\npractical alternative to his children in the succession to the English\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24: Perkin was the first of Lady\r\n                   Catherine Gordon's four husbands; her second was\r\n                   James Strangways, gentleman-usher to Henry VIII.,\r\n                   her third Sir Matthew Cradock (d. 1531), and her\r\n                   fourth Christopher Ashton, also gentleman-usher;\r\n                   she died in 1537 and was buried in Fyfield Church\r\n                   (_L. and P._, ii., 3512).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 25: See the present writer in _Dict. Nat.\r\n                   Biog._, lxiii., 172.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 26: _Sp. Cal._, i., No. 249; see below,\r\n                   p. 179.]\r\n\r\nBut all his statecraft, his patience and labour would have been writ\r\nin water without children to succeed him and carry on the work which\r\nhe had begun; and at times it seemed probable that this necessary\r\ncondition would remain unfulfilled. For the Tudors were singularly\r\nluckless in the matter of children. They were scarcely a sterile race,\r\nbut their offspring had an unfortunate habit of dying in childhood. It\r\nwas the desire for a male heir that involved Henry VIII. in his breach\r\nwith Rome, and led Mary into a marriage which raised a revolt; the\r\nlast of the Tudors perceived that heirs might be purchased at too\r\ngreat a cost, and solved the difficulty by admitting its insolubility.\r\nHenry VIII. had six wives, but only three children who survived\r\ninfancy; of these, Edward VI. withered away at the age of fifteen, and\r\nMary died childless at forty-two. By his two[27] mistresses he seems\r\nto have had only one son, who died at the age of eleven, and as far as\r\nwe know, he had not a single grandchild, legitimate or other. His\r\nsisters were hardly more fortunate. Margaret's eldest son by James IV.\r\ndied a year after his birth; her eldest daughter died at birth; her\r\nsecond son lived only nine months; her second daughter died at     (p. 013)\r\nbirth; her third son lived to be James V., but her fourth found an\r\nearly grave. Mary, the other sister of Henry VIII., lost her only son\r\nin his teens. The appalling death-rate among Tudor infants cannot be\r\nattributed solely to medical ignorance, for Yorkist babies clung to\r\nlife with a tenacity which was quite as inconvenient as the readiness\r\nwith which Tudor infants relinquished it; and Richard III., Henry VII.\r\nand Henry VIII. all found it necessary to accelerate, by artificial\r\nmeans, the exit from the world of the superfluous children of other\r\npretenders. This drastic process smoothed their path, but could not\r\ncompletely solve the problem; and the characteristic Tudor infirmity\r\nwas already apparent in the reign of Henry VII. He had three sons; two\r\npredeceased him, one at the age of fifteen years, the other at fifteen\r\nmonths. Of his four daughters, two died in infancy, and the youngest\r\ncost the mother her life.[28] The fruit of that union between the Red\r\nRose and the White, upon which so much store had been set,[29] seemed\r\ndoomed to fail.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 27: There is no definite evidence that he\r\n                   had more.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 28: _Ven. Cal._, i., 833.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 29: _Cf._ Skelton, _Works_, ed. Dyce.\r\n                   vol. i., pp. ix-xi.]\r\n\r\nThe hopes built upon it had largely contributed to the success of\r\nHenry's raid upon the English throne, and before he started on his\r\nquest he had solemnly promised to marry Elizabeth, eldest daughter of\r\nEdward IV., and heiress of the House of York. But he was resolute to\r\navoid all appearance of ruling in her right; his title had been\r\nrecognised by Parliament, and he had been five months _de facto_ king\r\nbefore he wedded his Yorkist wife (18th January, 1486). Eight months\r\nand two days later, the Queen gave birth, in the priory of St. Swithin's,\r\nat Winchester, to her first-born son. Four days later, on Sunday,  (p. 014)\r\n24th September, the child was christened in the minster of the old\r\nWest Saxon capital, and given in baptism the name of Arthur, the old\r\nBritish king. It was neither Yorkist nor Lancastrian, it evoked no\r\nbitter memories of civil strife, and it recalled the fact that the\r\nTudors claimed a pedigree and boasted a title to British sovereignty,\r\nbeside the antiquity of which Yorkist pretentions were a mushroom\r\ngrowth. Duke of Cornwall from his birth, Prince Arthur was, when three\r\nyears old, created Prince of Wales. Already negotiations had been\r\nbegun for his marriage with Catherine, the daughter of Ferdinand of\r\nAragon and Isabella of Castile. Both were cautious sovereigns, and\r\nmany a rebellion had to be put down and many a pretender put away,\r\nbefore they would consent to entrust their daughter to the care of an\r\nEnglish king. It was not till 2nd October, 1501, that Catherine landed\r\nat Plymouth. At her formal reception into England, and at her\r\nmarriage, six weeks later, in St. Paul's, she was led by the hand of\r\nher little brother-in-law, Prince Henry, then ten years old.[30]\r\nAgainst the advice of his council, Henry VII. sent the youthful bride\r\nand bridegroom to live as man and wife at Ludlow Castle, and there,\r\nfive and a half months later, their married life came to a sudden end.\r\nPrince Arthur died on 2nd April, 1502, and was buried in princely\r\nstate in Worcester Cathedral.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 30: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, i.,\r\n                   413-415; _L. and P._, _Henry VIII._, iv., 5791.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.                                                        (p. 015)\r\n\r\nPRINCE HENRY AND HIS ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince, who now succeeded to the position of heir-apparent, was\r\nnearly five years younger than his brother. The third child and second\r\nson of his parents, he was born on 28th June, 1491, at Greenwich, a\r\npalace henceforth intimately associated with the history of Tudor\r\nsovereigns. The manor of Greenwich had belonged to the alien priory of\r\nLewisham, and, on the dissolution of those houses, had passed into the\r\nhands of Henry IV. Then it was granted to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,\r\nwho began to enclose the palace grounds; on his death it reverted to\r\nthe Crown; and Edward IV., many of whose tastes and characteristics\r\nwere inherited by his grandson, Henry VIII., took great delight in\r\nbeautifying and extending the palace. He gave it to his Queen,\r\nElizabeth, and in her possession it remained until her sympathy with\r\nYorkist plots was punished by the forfeiture of her lands. Henry VII.\r\nthen bestowed it on his wife, the dowager's daughter, and thus it\r\nbecame the birthplace of her younger children. Here was the scene of\r\nmany a joust and tournament, of many a masque and revel; here the\r\nyoung Henry, as soon as he came to the throne, was wedded to Catherine\r\nof Aragon; here Henry's sister was married to the Duke of Suffolk; and\r\nhere were born all future Tudor sovereigns, Edward VI., Mary,      (p. 016)\r\nand Elizabeth. At Greenwich, then, through the forfeit of his\r\ngrandmother, Henry was born; he was baptised in the Church of the\r\nObservant Friars, an Order, the object first of his special favour,[31]\r\nand then of an equally marked dislike; the ceremony was performed by\r\nRichard Fox,[32] then Bishop of Exeter, and afterwards one of the\r\nchild's chief advisers. His nurse was named Ann Luke, and years\r\nafterwards, when Henry was King, he allowed her the annual pension of\r\ntwenty pounds, equivalent to about three hundred in modern currency.\r\nThe details of his early life are few and far between. Lord Herbert,\r\nwho wrote his _Life and Reign_ a century later, records that the young\r\nPrince was destined by his father for the see of Canterbury,[33] and\r\nprovided with an education more suited to a clerical than to a lay\r\ncareer. The motive ascribed to Henry VII. is typical of his character;\r\nit was more economical to provide for younger sons out of ecclesiastical,\r\nthan royal, revenues. But the story is probably a mere inference from\r\nthe excellence of the boy's education, and from his father's thrift.\r\nIf the idea of an ecclesiastical career for young Henry was ever\r\nentertained, it was soon abandoned for secular preferment. On 5th\r\nApril, 1492, before the child was ten months old, he was appointed to\r\nthe ancient and important posts of Warden of the Cinque Ports and\r\nConstable of Dover Castle.[34] A little later he received the still\r\nmore honourable office of Earl Marshal; the duties were performed by\r\ndeputy, but a goodly portion of the fees was doubtless             (p. 017)\r\nappropriated for the expenses of the boy's establishment, or found its\r\nway into the royal coffers. Further promotion awaited him at the\r\nmature age of three. On 12th September, 1494, he became Lord-Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland;[35] six weeks later he was created Duke of York, and\r\ndubbed, with the usual quaint and formal ceremonies,[36] a Knight of\r\nthe Bath. In December, he was made Warden of the Scottish Marches, and\r\nhe was invested with the Garter in the following May.[37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 31: _L. and P._, i., 4871.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 32: Fox's own statement, _L. and P._,\r\n                   iv., 5791.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 33: Herbert gives Paolo Sarpi as his\r\n                   authority.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 34: G.E.C [okayne], _Complete Peerage_,\r\n                   _s.v._ Cornwall.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 35: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, Rolls\r\n                   Ser., ii., 374.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 36: _Ib._, i., 388-404; _Paston Letters_,\r\n                   iii., 384-85.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 37: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, ii., 57.]\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of these great offices of State, any one of which\r\nmight have taxed the powers of a tried administrator, in the feeble\r\nhands of a child appears at first sight a trifle irrational; but there\r\nwas always method in Henry's madness. In bestowing these administrative\r\nposts upon his children he was really concentrating them in his own\r\nperson and bringing them directly under his own supervision. It was\r\nthe policy whereby the early Roman Emperors imposed upon Republican\r\nRome the substance, without the form, of despotism. It limited the\r\npowers of mischief which Henry's nobles might otherwise have enjoyed,\r\nand provided incomes for his children without increasing taxation or\r\ndiminishing the privy purse. The work of administration could be done\r\nat least as effectively, much more economically, and with far less\r\ndanger to internal peace by deputies of lower rank than the dukes and\r\nearls and barons who had been wont to abuse these high positions for\r\nthe furtherance of private ends, and often for the levying of      (p. 018)\r\nprivate war. Nowhere were the advantages of Henry's policy more\r\nconspicuous than in his arrangements for the government of Ireland.\r\nEver since Richard, Duke of York, and George, Duke of Clarence, had\r\nruled as Irish viceroys, Ireland had been a Yorkist stronghold. There\r\nSimnel had been crowned king, and there peers and peasants had fought\r\nfor Perkin Warbeck. Something must be done to heal the running sore.\r\nPossibly Henry thought that some of Ireland's loyalty might be\r\ndiverted from Yorkist channels by the selection of a Tudor prince as\r\nits viceroy; but he put his trust in more solid measures. As deputy to\r\nhis infant son he nominated one who, though but a knight, was perhaps\r\nthe ablest man among his privy council. It was in this capacity that\r\nSir Edward Poynings[38] crossed to Ireland about the close of 1494,\r\nand called the Parliament of Drogheda. Judged by the durability of its\r\nlegislation, it was one of the most memorable of parliaments; and for\r\nnearly three hundred years Poynings' laws remained the foundation upon\r\nwhich rested the constitutional relations between the sister kingdoms.\r\nEven more lasting was the precedent set by Prince Henry's creation as\r\nDuke of York; from that day to this, from Henry VIII. to the present\r\nPrince of Wales, the second son of the sovereign or of the heir-apparent\r\nhas almost invariably been invested with that dukedom.[39] The original\r\nselection of the title was due to substantial reasons. Henry's name\r\nwas distinctively Lancastrian, his title was no less distinctively\r\nYorkist; it was adopted as a concession to Yorkist prejudice.      (p. 019)\r\nIt was a practical reminder of the fact which the Tudor laureate,\r\nSkelton, celebrated in song: \"The rose both red and white, in one rose\r\nnow doth grow\". It was also a tacit assertion of the death of the last\r\nDuke of York in the Tower and of the imposture of Perkin Warbeck, now\r\npretending to the title.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 38: See the present writer in _D.N.B._,\r\n                   xlvi., 271.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 39: An exception was made in the case of\r\n                   the late Duke of Edinburgh. It was designed if\r\n                   Henry VIII. had a second son, to make him Duke of\r\n                   York (_L. and P._, vii., 1364).]\r\n\r\nBut thoughts of the coercion of Ireland and conciliation of Yorkists\r\nwere as yet far from the mind of the child, round whose person these\r\nmeasures were made to centre. Precocious he must have been, if the\r\nphenomenal development of brow and the curiously mature expression\r\nattributed to him in his portrait[40] are any indication of his\r\nintellectual powers at the age at which he is represented. Without the\r\nchildish lips and nose, the face might well be that of a man of fifty;\r\nand with the addition of a beard, the portrait would be an unmistakable\r\nlikeness of Henry himself in his later years. When the Prince was no\r\nmore than a child, says Erasmus, he was set to study.[41] He had, we\r\nare told, a vivid and active mind, above measure able to execute\r\nwhatever tasks he undertook; and he never attempted anything in which\r\nhe did not succeed.[42] The Tudors had no modern dread of educational\r\nover-pressure when applied to their children, and the young Henry was\r\nprobably as forward a pupil as his son, Edward VI., his daughter,\r\nElizabeth, or his grand-niece, Lady Jane Grey. But, fortunately for\r\nHenry, a physical exuberance corrected his mental precocity; and,  (p. 020)\r\nas he grew older, any excessive devotion to the Muses was checked by\r\nan unwearied pursuit of bodily culture. He was the first of English\r\nsovereigns to be educated under the new influence of the Renaissance.\r\nScholars, divines and poets thronged the Court of Henry VII. Margaret\r\nBeaufort, who ruled in Henry's household, was a signal benefactor to\r\nthe cause of English learning. Lady Margaret professors commemorate\r\nher name in both our ancient universities, and in their bidding prayers\r\nshe is to this day remembered. Two colleges at Cambridge revere her as\r\ntheir foundress; Caxton, the greatest of English printers, owed much\r\nto her munificence, and she herself translated into English books from\r\nboth Latin and French. Henry VII., though less accomplished that the\r\nlater Tudors, evinced an intelligent interest in art and letters, and\r\nprovided for his children efficient instructors; while his Queen,\r\nElizabeth of York, is described by Erasmus as possessing the soundest\r\njudgment and as being remarkable for her prudence as well as for her\r\npiety. Bernard Andre,[43] historian and poet, who had been tutor to\r\nPrince Arthur, probably took no small part in the education of his\r\nyounger brother; to him he dedicated, after Arthur's death, two of the\r\nannual summaries of events which he was in the habit of compiling.\r\nGiles D'Ewes,[44] apparently a Frenchman and the author of a notable\r\nFrench grammar, taught that language to Prince Henry, as many      (p. 021)\r\nyears later he did to his daughter, Queen Mary; probably either D'Ewes\r\nor Andre trained his handwriting, which is a curious compromise\r\nbetween the clear and bold Italian style, soon to be adopted by\r\nwell-instructed Englishmen, and the old English hieroglyphics in which\r\nmore humbly educated individuals, including Shakespeare, concealed the\r\nmeaning of their words. But the most famous of Henry's teachers was\r\nthe poet Skelton, the greatest name in English verse from Lydgate down\r\nto Surrey. Skelton was poet laureate to Henry VII. Court, and refers\r\nin his poems to his wearing of the white and green of Tudor\r\nliveries.[45] He celebrated in verse Arthur's creation as Prince of\r\nWales and Henry's as Duke of York;[46] and before the younger prince\r\nwas nine years old, this \"incomparable light and ornament of British\r\nLetters,\" as Erasmus styles him, was directing Henry's studies.\r\nSkelton himself writes.--\r\n\r\n  The honor of England I learned to spell,\r\n  I gave him drink of the sugred well\r\n  Of Helicon's waters crystalline,\r\n  Acquainting him with the Muses nine.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 40: This is an anonymous portrait of\r\n                   Henry at the age of eighteen months or two years\r\n                   belonging to Sir Edmund and Lady Verney.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 41: Erasmus, _Epist._, p. 1182; _L. and\r\n                   P._, iv., 5412.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 42: This testimonial was written in 1528\r\n                   before Henry VIII. had given the most striking\r\n                   demonstrations of its truth.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 43: See _D.N.B._, i., 398. Erasmus,\r\n                   however, described Andre as being \"of mean\r\n                   abilities\" (_L. and P._, iv., 626).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 44: _D.N.B._, xiv., 449; _cf._ _L. and\r\n                   P._, i., 513. On Henry VIII's accession D'Ewes was\r\n                   appointed keeper of the King's library at Richmond\r\n                   with a salary of L10 per year.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 45: Skelton, _Works_, ed. Dyce, vol. i.,\r\n                   p. xiii.; the white and green still survive as the\r\n                   colours of Jesus College, Oxford, founded by Queen\r\n                   Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 46: _Ib._, p. xxi.; a copy of the latter,\r\n                   which Dyce could not find, is in _Brit. Mus. Addit.\r\n                   MS. 26787_.]\r\n\r\nThe coarseness of Skelton's satires and his open disregard of the\r\nclerical vows of chastity may justify some doubt of the value of the\r\npoet's influence on Henry's character; but he so far observed the\r\nconventional duties of his post as to dedicate to his royal pupil, in\r\n1501, a moral treatise in Latin of no particular worth.[47] More\r\ndeserving of Henry's study were two books inscribed to him a       (p. 022)\r\nlittle later by young Boerio, son of the King's Genoese physician and\r\na pupil of Erasmus, who, according to his own account, suffered untold\r\nafflictions from the father's temper. One was a translation of\r\nIsocrates' _De Regno_, the other of Lucian's tract against believing\r\ncalumnies.[48] The latter was, to judge from the tale of Henry's\r\nvictims, a precept which he scarcely laid to heart in youth. In other\r\nrespects he was apt enough to learn. He showed \"remarkable docility\r\nfor mathematics,\" became proficient in Latin, spoke French with ease,\r\nunderstood Italian, and, later on, possibly from Catherine of Aragon,\r\nacquired a knowledge of Spanish. In 1499 Erasmus himself, the greatest\r\nof the humanists, visited his friend, Lord Mountjoy, near Greenwich,\r\nand made young Henry's acquaintance. \"I was staying,\" he writes,[49]\r\n\"at Lord Mountjoy's country house when Thomas More came to see me, and\r\ntook me out with him for a walk as far as the next village, where all\r\nthe King's children, except Prince Arthur, who was then the eldest\r\nson, were being educated. When we came into the hall, the attendants\r\nnot only of the palace, but also of Mountjoy's household, were all\r\nassembled. In the midst stood Prince Henry, now nine years old, and\r\nhaving already something of royalty in his demeanour in which there\r\nwas a certain dignity combined with singular courtesy. On his right\r\nwas Margaret, about eleven years of age, afterwards married to James,\r\nKing of Scots; and on his left played Mary, a child of four. Edmund\r\nwas an infant in arms. More, with his companion Arnold, after      (p. 023)\r\npaying his respects to the boy Henry, the same that is now King of\r\nEngland, presented him with some writing. For my part, not having\r\nexpected anything of the sort, I had nothing to offer, but promised\r\nthat, on another occasion, I would in some way declare my duty towards\r\nhim. Meantime, I was angry with More for not having warned me, especially\r\nas the boy sent me a little note, while we were at dinner, to challenge\r\nsomething from my pen. I went home, and in the Muses' spite, from whom\r\nI had been so long divorced, finished the poem within three days.\" The\r\npoem,[50] in which Britain speaks her own praise and that of her\r\nprinces, Henry VII. and his children, was dedicated to the Duke of\r\nYork and accompanied by a letter in which Erasmus commended Henry's\r\ndevotion to learning. Seven years later Erasmus again wrote to Henry,\r\nnow Prince of Wales, condoling with him upon the death of his\r\nbrother-in-law, Philip of Burgundy, King of Castile. Henry replied in\r\ncordial manner, inviting the great scholar to continue the correspondence.\r\nThe style of his letter so impressed Erasmus that he suspected, as he\r\nsays,[51] \"some help from others in the ideas and expressions. In a\r\nconversation I afterwards had with William, Lord Mountjoy, he tried by\r\nvarious arguments to dispel that suspicion, and when he found he could\r\nnot do so he gave up the point and let it pass until he was\r\nsufficiently instructed in the case. On another occasion, when we were\r\ntalking alone together, he brought out a number of the Prince's\r\nletters, some to other people and some to himself, and among them one\r\nwhich answered to mine: in these letters were manifest signs of    (p. 024)\r\ncomment, addition, suppression, correction and alteration--You might\r\nrecognise the first drafting of a letter, and you might make out the\r\nsecond and third, and sometimes even the fourth correction; but\r\nwhatever was revised or added was in the same handwriting. I had then\r\nno further grounds for hesitation, and, overcome by the facts, I laid\r\naside all suspicion.\" Neither, he adds, would his correspondent doubt\r\nHenry VIII's authorship of the book against Luther if he knew that\r\nking's \"happy genius\". That famous book is sufficient proof that\r\ntheological studies held no small place in Henry's education. They\r\nwere cast in the traditional mould, for the Lancastrians were very\r\northodox, and the early Tudors followed in their steps. Margaret\r\nBeaufort left her husband to devote herself to good works and a\r\nsemi-monastic life; Henry VII. converted a heretic at the stake and\r\nleft him to burn;[52] and the theological conservatism, which Henry\r\nVIII. imbibed in youth, clung to him to the end of his days.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 47: _Brit.

Even as Duke of York he had\r\na band of minstrels apart from those of the King and Prince Arthur;[53]\r\nand when he was king his minstrels formed an indispensable part of his\r\nretinue, whether he went on progress through his kingdom, or crossed\r\nthe seas on errands of peace or war.[54] He became an expert performer\r\non the lute, the organ and the harpsichord, and all the cares of State\r\ncould not divert him from practising on those instruments both day (p. 025)\r\nand night. He sent all over England in search of singing men and boys\r\nfor the chapel royal, and sometimes appropriated choristers from\r\nWolsey's chapel, which he thought better provided than his own.[55]\r\nFrom Venice he enticed to England the organist of St. Mark's, Dionysius\r\nMemo, and on occasion Henry and his Court listened four hours at a\r\nstretch to Memo's organ recitals.[56] Not only did he take delight in\r\nthe practice of music by himself and others; he also studied its\r\ntheory and wrote with the skill of an expert. Vocal and instrumental\r\npieces of his own composition, preserved among the manuscripts at the\r\nBritish Museum,[57] rank among the best productions of the time; and\r\none of his anthems, \"O Lorde, the Maker of all thyng,\" is of the\r\nhighest order of merit, and still remains a favourite in English\r\ncathedrals.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 53: _Hist. MSS. Comm._, 5th Rep., App.,\r\n                   p. 549.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 54: _L. and P._, i., 4314.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 55: _L. and P._, ii., 410, 4024.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 56: _Ven.

MS. 31922_.]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1502, at the age of ten, Henry became the heir-apparent to\r\nthe English throne. He succeeded at once to the dukedom of Cornwall,\r\nbut again a precedent was set which was followed but yesterday; and\r\nten months were allowed to elapse before he was, on 18th February,\r\n1503, created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, the dukedom of York\r\nbecoming void until a king or an heir apparent should again have a\r\nsecond son.[58] The first sign of his increased importance was his\r\nimplication in the maze of matrimonial intrigues which formed so large\r\na part of sixteenth-century diplomacy. The last thing kings        (p. 026)\r\nconsidered was the domestic felicity of their children; their marriages\r\nwere pieces in the diplomatic game and sometimes the means by which\r\nStates were built up. While Duke of York, Henry had been proposed as a\r\nhusband for Eleanor,[59] daughter of the Archduke Philip; and his\r\nsister Mary as the bride of Philip's son Charles, who, as the heir of\r\nthe houses of Castile and of Aragon, of Burgundy and of Austria, was\r\nfrom the cradle destined to wield the imperial sceptre of Caesar. No\r\nfurther steps were taken at the time, and Prince Arthur's death\r\nbrought other projects to the front.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 58: The next prince to hold the title was\r\n                   Charles, afterwards Charles I., who was created\r\n                   Duke of York on 6th Jan., 1605.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 59: Afterwards Queen of Portugal and then\r\n                   of France. _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, i., 285,\r\n                   425.]\r\n\r\nImmediately on receiving the news, and two days before they dated\r\ntheir letter of condolence to Henry VII., Ferdinand and Isabella\r\ncommissioned the Duke of Estrada to negotiate a marriage between the\r\nwidowed Catherine and her youthful brother-in-law.[60] No doubt was\r\nentertained but that the Pope would grant the necessary dispensation,\r\nfor the spiritual head of Christendom was apt to look tenderly on the\r\npetitions of the powerful princes of this world. A more serious\r\ndifficulty was the question of the widow's dower. Part only had been\r\npaid, and Ferdinand not merely refused to hand over the rest, but\r\ndemanded the return of his previous instalments. Henry, on the other\r\nhand, considered himself entitled to the whole, refused to refund a\r\npenny, and gave a cold reception to the proposed marriage between\r\nCatherine and his sole surviving son. He was, however, by no means\r\nblind to the advantages of the Spanish matrimonial and political\r\nalliance, and still less to the attractions of Catherine's dower;  (p. 027)\r\nhe declined to send back the Princess, when Isabella, shocked at Henry\r\nVII.'s proposal to marry his daughter-in-law himself, demanded her\r\nreturn; and eventually, when Ferdinand reduced his terms, he suffered\r\nthe marriage treaty to be signed. On 25th June, 1503, Prince Henry and\r\nCatherine were solemnly betrothed in the Bishop of Salisbury's house,\r\nin Fleet Street.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 60: _Sp. Cal._, i., 267.]\r\n\r\nThe papal dispensation arrived in time to solace Isabella on her\r\ndeath-bed in November, 1504; but that event once more involved in\r\ndoubt the prospects of the marriage. The crown of Castile passed from\r\nIsabella to her daughter Juana; the government of the kingdom was\r\nclaimed by Ferdinand and by Juana's husband, Philip of Burgundy. On\r\ntheir way from the Netherlands to claim their inheritance, Philip and\r\nJuana were driven on English shores. Henry VII. treated them with all\r\npossible courtesy, and made Philip a Knight of the Garter, while\r\nPhilip repaid the compliment by investing Prince Henry with the Order\r\nof the Golden Fleece.[61] But advantage was taken of Philip's plight\r\nto extort from him the surrender of the Earl of Suffolk, styled the\r\nWhite Rose, and a commercial treaty with the Netherlands, which the\r\nFlemings named the Malus Intercursus. Three months after his arrival\r\nin Castile, Philip died, and Henry began to fish in the troubled\r\nwaters for a share in his dominions. Two marriage schemes occurred to\r\nhim; he might win the hand of Philip's sister Margaret, now Regent of\r\nthe Netherlands, and with her hand the control of those provinces; or\r\nhe might marry Juana and claim in her right to administer Castile. On\r\nthe acquisition of Castile he set his mind. If he could not gain   (p. 028)\r\nit by marriage with Juana, he thought he could do so by marrying\r\nher son and heir, the infant Charles, to his daughter Mary. Whichever\r\nmeans he took to further his design, it would naturally irritate\r\nFerdinand and make him less anxious for the completion of the marriage\r\nbetween Catherine and Prince Henry. Henry VII. was equally averse from\r\nthe consummation of the match. Now that he was scheming with Charles's\r\nother grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian, to wrest the government of\r\nCastile from Ferdinand's grasp, the alliance of the King of Aragon had\r\nlost its attraction, and it was possible that the Prince of Wales\r\nmight find elsewhere a more desirable bride. Henry's marriage with\r\nCatherine was to have been accomplished when he completed the age of\r\nfourteen; but on the eve of his fifteenth birthday he made a solemn\r\nprotestation that the contract was null and void, and that he would\r\nnot carry out his engagements.[62] This protest left him free to\r\nconsider other proposals, and enhanced his value as a negotiable\r\nasset. More than once negotiations were started for marrying him to\r\nMarguerite de Valois, sister of the Duke of Angouleme, afterwards\r\nfamous as Francis I.;[63] and in the last months of his father's\r\nreign, the Prince of Wales was giving audience to ambassadors from\r\nMaximilian, who came to suggest matrimonial alliances between the\r\nprince and a daughter of Duke Albert of Bavaria, and between Henry\r\nVII. and the Lady Margaret of Savoy, Regent of the Netherlands.[64]\r\nMeanwhile, Ferdinand, threatened on all sides, first came to terms (p. 029)\r\nwith France; he married a French princess, Germaine de Foix, abandoned\r\nhis claim to Navarre, and bought the security of Naples by giving\r\nLouis XII. a free hand in the north of Italy. He then diverted\r\nMaximilian from his designs on Castile by humouring his hostility to\r\nVenice. By that bait he succeeded in drawing off his enemies, and the\r\nleague of Cambrai united them all, Ferdinand and Louis, Emperor and\r\nPope, in an iniquitous attack on the Italian Republic. Henry VII.,\r\nfortunately for his reputation, was left out of the compact. He was\r\nstill cherishing his design on Castile, and in December, 1508, the\r\ntreaty of marriage between Mary and Charles was formally signed. It\r\nwas the last of his worldly triumphs; the days of his life were\r\nnumbered, and in the early months of 1509 he was engaged in making a\r\npeace with his conscience.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 61: _L. and P._, _Henry VII._, ii., 158;\r\n                   _Ven.

Cal._, Suppl., p. 23.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four years during which Henry VII. had guided the destinies\r\nof England were a momentous epoch in the development of Western\r\ncivilisation. It was the dawn of modern history, of the history of\r\nEurope in the form in which we know it to-day. The old order was in a\r\nstate of liquidation. The mediaeval ideal, described by Dante, of a\r\nuniversal monarchy with two aspects, spiritual and temporal, and two\r\nheads, emperor and pope, was passing away. Its place was taken by the\r\nmodern but narrower ideal of separate polities, each pursuing its own\r\ncourse, independent of, and often in conflict with, other societies.\r\nUnity gave way to diversity of tongues, of churches, of states; and\r\nthe cosmopolitan became nationalist, patriot, separatist. Imperial\r\nmonarchy shrank to a shadow; and kings divided the emperor's power (p. 030)\r\nat the same time that they consolidated their own. They extended their\r\nauthority on both sides, at the expense of their superior, the\r\nemperor, and at the expense of their subordinate feudal lords. The\r\nstruggle between the disruptive forces of feudalism and the central\r\npower of monarchy ended at last in monarchical triumph; and internal\r\nunity prepared the way for external expansion. France under Louis XI.\r\nwas first in the field. She had surmounted her civil troubles half a\r\ncentury earlier than England. She then expelled her foreign foes,\r\ncrushed the remnants of feudal independence, and began to expand at\r\nthe cost of weaker States. Parts of Burgundy, Provence, and Brittany\r\nbecame merged in France; the exuberant strength of the new-formed\r\nnation burst the barriers of the Alps and overflowed into the plains\r\nof Italy. The time of universal monarchy was past, but the dread of it\r\nremained; and from Charles VIII.'s invasion of Italy in 1494 to\r\nFrancis I.'s defeat at Pavia in 1525, French dreams of world-wide\r\nsovereignty were the nightmare of other kings. Those dreams might, as\r\nEurope feared, have been realised, had not other States followed\r\nFrance in the path of internal consolidation. Ferdinand of Aragon\r\nmarried Isabella of Castile, drove out the Moors, and founded the\r\nmodern Spanish kingdom. Maximilian married Mary, the daughter of\r\nCharles the Bold, and joined the Netherlands to Austria. United France\r\nfound herself face to face with other united States, and the political\r\nsystem of modern Europe was roughly sketched out. The boundaries of\r\nthe various kingdoms were fluctuating. There still remained minor\r\nprincipalities and powers, chiefly in Italy and Germany, which offered\r\nan easy prey to their ambitious neighbours; for both nations had   (p. 031)\r\nsacrificed internal unity to the shadow of universal dominion, Germany\r\nin temporal, and Italy in spiritual, things. Mutual jealousy of each\r\nother's growth at the expense of these States gave rise to the theory\r\nof the balance of power; mutual adjustment of each other's disputes\r\nproduced international law; and the necessity of watching each other's\r\ndesigns begat modern diplomacy.[65]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 65: _Cf._ A.O. Meyer, _Die Englische\r\n                   Diplomatie_, Breslau, 1901.]\r\n\r\nParallel with these developments in the relations between one State\r\nand another marched a no less momentous revolution in the domestic\r\nposition of their sovereigns. National expansion abroad was marked by\r\na corresponding growth in royal authority at home. The process was not\r\nnew in England; every step in the path of the tribal chief of Saxon\r\npirates to the throne of a united England denoted an advance in the\r\nnature of kingly power. Each extension of his sway intensified his\r\nauthority, and his power grew in degree as it increased in area. So\r\nwith fifteenth-century sovereigns. Local liberties and feudal rights\r\nwhich had checked a Duke of Brittany or a King of Aragon were\r\npowerless to restrain the King of France or of Spain. The sphere of\r\nroyal authority encroached upon all others; all functions and all\r\npowers tended to concentrate in royal hands. The king was the emblem\r\nof national unity, the centre of national aspirations, and the object\r\nof national reverence. The Renaissance gave fresh impetus to the\r\nmovement. Men turned not only to the theology, literature, and art of\r\nthe early Christian era; they began to study anew its political\r\norganisation and its system of law and jurisprudence. The code of\r\nJustinian was as much a revelation as the original Greek of the    (p. 032)\r\nNew Testament. Roman imperial law seemed as superior to the barbarities\r\nof common law as classical was to mediaeval Latin; and Roman law\r\nsupplanted indigenous systems in France and in Germany, in Spain and\r\nin Scotland. Both the Roman imperial law and the Roman imperial\r\nconstitution were useful models for kings of the New Monarchy; the\r\nRoman Empire was a despotism; _quod principi placuit legis habet\r\nvigorem_ ran the fundamental principle of Roman Empire.[66] Nor was\r\nthis all; Roman emperors were habitually deified, and men in the\r\nsixteenth century seemed to pay to their kings while alive the Divine\r\nhonours which Romans paid to their emperors when dead. \"Le nouveau\r\nMessie,\" says Michelet, \"est le roi.\"[67]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 66: The conclusion of the maxim _utpote\r\n                   cum lege regia quae de imperio ejus lata est,\r\n                   populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et\r\n                   potestatem conferat_ (Ulpian, _Digest_, I., iv.,\r\n                   1), was conveniently forgotten by apologists for\r\n                   absolutism, though the Tudors respected it in\r\n                   practice.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 67: _Hist. de France_, ed. 1879, ix.,\r\n                   301.]\r\n\r\nNowhere was the king more emphatically the saviour of society than in\r\nEngland. The sixty years of Lancastrian rule were in the seventeenth\r\ncentury represented as the golden age of parliamentary government, a\r\nsort of time before the fall to which popular orators appealed when\r\nthey wished to paint in vivid colours the evils of Stuart tyranny. But\r\nto keen observers of the time the pre-eminent characteristic of\r\nLancastrian rule appeared to be its \"lack of governance\" or, in modern\r\nphrase, administrative anarchy.[68] There was no subordination in the\r\nState. The weakness of the Lancastrian title left the king at the\r\nmercy of Parliament, and the limitations of Parliament were never  (p. 033)\r\nmore apparent than when its powers stood highest. Even in the realm of\r\nlegislation, the statute book has seldom been so barren. Its principal\r\nacts were to narrow the county electorate to an oligarchy, to restrict\r\nthe choice of constituencies to resident knights and burgesses, and to\r\nimpair its own influence as a focus of public opinion. It was not\r\ncontent with legislative authority; it interfered with an executive\r\nwhich it could hamper but could not control. It was possessed by the\r\ninveterate fallacy that freedom and strong government are things\r\nincompatible; that the executive is the natural enemy of the Legislature;\r\nthat if one is strong, the other must be weak; and of the two\r\nalternatives it vastly preferred a weak executive. So, to limit the\r\nking's power, it sought to make him \"live of his own,\" when \"his own\"\r\nwas absolutely inadequate to meet the barest necessities of government.\r\nParliament was in fact irresponsible; the connecting link between it\r\nand the executive had yet to be found. Hence the Lancastrian \"lack of\r\ngovernance\"; it ended in a generation of civil war, and the memory of\r\nthat anarchy explains much in Tudor history.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 68: Fortescue, _Governance of England_,\r\n                   ed. Plummer, 1885.]\r\n\r\nThe problems of Henry VIII.'s reign can indeed only be solved by\r\nrealising the misrule of the preceding century, the failure of\r\nparliamentary government, and the strength of the popular demand for a\r\nfirm and masterful hand. It is a modern myth that Englishmen have\r\nalways been consumed with enthusiasm for parliamentary government and\r\nwith a thirst for a parliamentary vote. The interpretation of history,\r\nlike that of the Scriptures, varies from age to age; and present\r\npolitical theories colour our views of the past. The political\r\ndevelopment of the nineteenth century created a parliamentary legend;\r\nand civil and religious liberty became the inseparable stage       (p. 034)\r\nproperties of the Englishman. Whenever he appeared on the boards, he\r\nwas made to declaim about the rights of the subject and the privileges\r\nof Parliament. It was assumed that the desire for a voice in the\r\nmanagement of his own affairs had at all times and all seasons been\r\nthe mainspring of his actions; and so the story of Henry's rule was\r\nmade into a political mystery. In reality, love of freedom has not\r\nalways been, nor will it always remain, the predominant note in the\r\nEnglish mind. At times the English people have pursued it through\r\nbattle and murder with grim determination, but other times have seen\r\nother ideals. On occasion the demand has been for strong government\r\nirrespective of its methods, and good government has been preferred to\r\nself-government. Wars of expansion and wars of defence have often\r\ncooled the love of liberty and impaired the faith in parliaments; and\r\ngenerally English ideals have been strictly subordinated to a passion\r\nfor material prosperity.\r\n\r\nNever was this more apparent than under the Tudors. The parliamentary\r\nexperiment of the Lancastrians was premature and had failed.\r\nParliamentary institutions were discredited and people were\r\nindifferent to parliamentary rights and privileges: \"A plague on both\r\nyour Houses,\" was the popular feeling, \"give us peace, above all peace\r\nat home to pursue new avenues of wealth, new phases of commercial\r\ndevelopment, peace to study new problems of literature, religion, and\r\nart\"; and both Houses passed out of the range of popular imagination,\r\nand almost out of the sphere of independent political action.\r\nParliament played during the sixteenth century a modester part than it\r\nhad played since its creation. Towards the close of the period     (p. 035)\r\nShakespeare wrote his play of _King John_, and in that play there is\r\nnot the faintest allusion to Magna Carta.[69] Such an omission would\r\nbe inconceivable now or at any time since the death of Elizabeth; for\r\nthe Great Charter is enshrined in popular imagination as the palladium\r\nof the British constitution. It was the fetish to which Parliament\r\nappealed against the Stuarts. But no such appeal would have touched a\r\nTudor audience. It needed and desired no weapon against a sovereign\r\nwho embodied national desires, and ruled in accord with the national\r\nwill. References to the charter are as rare in parliamentary debates\r\nas they are in the pages of Shakespeare. The best hated instruments of\r\nStuart tyranny were popular institutions under the Tudors; and the\r\nStar Chamber itself found its main difficulty in the number of suitors\r\nwhich flocked to a court where the king was judge, the law's delays\r\nminimised, counsel's fees moderate, and justice rarely denied merely\r\nbecause it might happen to be illegal. England in the sixteenth\r\ncentury put its trust in its princes far more than it did in its\r\nparliaments; it invested them with attributes almost Divine. By Tudor\r\nmajesty the poet was inspired with thoughts of the divinity that doth\r\nhedge a king. \"Love for the King,\" wrote a Venetian of Henry VIII. in\r\nthe early years of his reign, \"is universal with all who see him, for\r\nhis Highness does not seem a person of this world, but one         (p. 036)\r\ndescended from heaven.\"[70] _Le nouveau Messie est le Roi._\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 69: Magna Carta may almost be said to\r\n                   have been \"discovered\" by the parliamentary\r\n                   opponents of the Stuarts; and in discovering it,\r\n                   they misinterpreted several of its clauses such as\r\n                   the _judicium parium_. Allusion was, however, made\r\n                   to Magna Carta in the proceedings against Wolsey\r\n                   for _Praemunire_ (Fox, vi., 43).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 70: _Ven Cal._, ii., 336.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the tendencies which Henry VII. and Henry VIII. crystallised\r\ninto practical weapons of absolute government. Few kings have attained\r\na greater measure of permanent success than the first of the Tudors;\r\nit was he who laid the unseen foundations upon which Henry VIII.\r\nerected the imposing edifice of his personal authority. An orphan from\r\nbirth and an exile from childhood, he stood near enough to the throne\r\nto invite Yorkist proscription, but too far off to unite in his favour\r\nLancastrian support. He owed his elevation to the mistakes of his\r\nenemies and to the cool, calculating craft which enabled him to use\r\nthose mistakes without making mistakes of his own. He ran the great\r\nrisk of his life in his invasion of England, but henceforth he left\r\nnothing to chance. He was never betrayed by passion or enthusiasm into\r\nrash adventures, and he loved the substance, rather than the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of power. Untrammelled by scruples, unimpeded by principles,\r\nhe pursued with constant fidelity the task of his life, to secure the\r\nthrone for himself and his children, to pacify his country, and to\r\nrepair the waste of the civil wars. Folly easily glides into war, but\r\nto establish a permanent peace required all Henry's patience, clear\r\nsight and far sight, caution and tenacity. A full exchequer, not empty\r\nglory, was his first requisite, and he found in his foreign wars a\r\nmine of money. Treason at home was turned to like profit, and the\r\nforfeited estates of rebellious lords accumulated in the hands of the\r\nroyal family and filled the national coffers. Attainder, the\r\ncharacteristic instrument of Tudor policy, was employed to         (p. 037)\r\ncomplete the ruin of the old English peerage which the Wars of the\r\nRoses began: and by 1509 there was only one duke and one marquis left\r\nin the whole of England.[71] Attainder not only removed the particular\r\ntraitor, but disqualified his family for place and power; and the process\r\nof eliminating feudalism from the region of government, started by\r\nEdward I., was finished by Henry VII. Feudal society has been described\r\nas a pyramid; the upper slopes were now washed away leaving an\r\nimpassable precipice, with the Tudor monarch alone in his glory at its\r\nsummit. Royalty had become a caste apart. Marriages between royal\r\nchildren and English peers had hitherto been no uncommon thing; since\r\nHenry VII.'s accession there have been but four, two of them in our\r\nown day. Only one took place in the sixteenth century, and the Duke of\r\nSuffolk was by some thought worthy of death for his presumption in\r\nmarrying the sister of Henry VIII. The peerage was weakened not only\r\nby diminishing numbers, but by the systematic depression of those who\r\nremained. Henry VII., like Ferdinand of Aragon,[72] preferred to\r\ngovern by means of lawyers and churchmen; they could be rewarded by\r\njudgeships and bishoprics, and required no grants from the royal\r\nestates. Their occupancy of office kept out territorial magnates who\r\nabused it for private ends. Of the sixteen regents nominated by Henry\r\nVIII. in his will, not one could boast a peerage of twelve years'\r\nstanding;[73] and all the great Tudor ministers, Wolsey and        (p. 038)\r\nCromwell, Cecil and Walsingham, were men of comparatively humble birth.\r\nWith similar objects Henry VII. passed laws limiting the number of\r\nretainers and forbidding the practice of maintenance. The courts of\r\nStar Chamber and Requests were developed to keep in order his powerful\r\nsubjects and give poor men protection against them. Their civil law\r\nprocedure, influenced by Roman imperial maxims, served to enhance the\r\nroyal power and dignity, and helped to build up the Tudor autocracy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 71: The Duke was Buckingham, and the\r\n                   Marquis was Dorset.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 72: See a description of Ferdinand's\r\n                   court by John Stile, the English envoy, in _L. and\r\n                   P._, i., 490.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 73: See the present writer's _England\r\n                   under Protector Somerset_, p. 38.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the office of king thus developed and magnified, the young Prince\r\nwho stood upon the steps of the throne brought personal qualities of\r\nthe highest order, and advantages to which his father was completely a\r\nstranger. His title was secure, his treasury overflowed, and he\r\nenjoyed the undivided affections of his people. There was no alternative\r\nclaimant. The White Rose, indeed, had languished in the Tower since\r\nhis surrender by Philip, and the Duke of Buckingham had some years\r\nbefore been mentioned as a possible successor to the throne;[74] but\r\ntheir claims only served to remind men that nothing but Henry's life\r\nstood between them and anarchy, for his young brother Edmund, Duke of\r\nSomerset, had preceded Arthur to an early grave. Upon the single\r\nthread of Henry's life hung the peace of the realm; no other could\r\nhave secured the throne without a second civil war. It was small\r\nwonder if England regarded Henry with a somewhat extravagant loyalty.\r\nNever had king ascended the throne more richly endowed with mental and\r\nphysical gifts. He was ten weeks short of his eighteenth year.     (p. 039)\r\nFrom both his parents he inherited grace of mind and of person. His\r\nfather in later years was broken in health and soured in spirit, but\r\nin the early days of his reign he had charmed the citizens of York\r\nwith his winning smile. His mother is described by the Venetian\r\nambassador as a woman of great beauty and ability. She transmitted to\r\nHenry many of the popular characteristics of her father, Edward IV.,\r\nthough little of the military genius of that consummate commander who\r\nfought thirteen pitched battles and lost not one. Unless eye-witnesses\r\nsadly belied themselves, Henry VIII. must have been the desire of all\r\neyes. \"His Majesty,\" wrote one a year or two later,[75] \"is the\r\nhandsomest potentate I ever set eyes on; above the usual height, with\r\nan extremely fine calf to his leg; his complexion fair and bright,\r\nwith auburn hair combed straight and short in the French fashion, and\r\na round face so very beautiful that it would become a pretty woman,\r\nhis throat being rather long and thick.... He speaks French, English,\r\nLatin, and a little Italian; plays well on the lute and harpsichord,\r\nsings from the book at sight, draws the bow with greater strength than\r\nany man in England, and jousts marvellously.\" Another foreign resident\r\nin 1519[76] described him as \"extremely handsome. Nature could not\r\nhave done more for him. He is much handsomer than any other sovereign\r\nin Christendom; a great deal handsomer than the King of France; very\r\nfair and his whole frame admirably proportioned. On hearing that\r\nFrancis I. wore a beard, he allowed his own to grow, and as it is  (p. 040)\r\nreddish, he has now got a beard that looks like gold. He is very\r\naccomplished, a good musician, composes well, is a capital horseman, a\r\nfine jouster, speaks French, Latin, and Spanish.... He is very fond of\r\nhunting, and never takes his diversion without tiring eight or ten\r\nhorses which he causes to be stationed beforehand along the line of\r\ncountry he means to take, and when one is tired he mounts another, and\r\nbefore he gets home they are all exhausted. He is extremely fond of\r\ntennis, at which game it is the prettiest thing in the world to see\r\nhim play, his fair skin glowing through a shirt of the finest\r\ntexture.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 74: _L. and P., Henry VII._, i., 180,\r\n                   233, 319.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 75:_L. and P._, ii., 395.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 76: Giustinian, _Despatches_, ii., 312;\r\n                   _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1287; _L. and P._, iii., 402.]\r\n\r\nThe change from the cold suspicious Henry VII. to such a king as this\r\nwas inevitably greeted with a burst of rapturous enthusiasm. \"I have\r\nno fear,\" wrote Mountjoy to Erasmus,[77] \"but when you heard that our\r\nPrince, now Henry the Eighth, whom we may well call our Octavius, had\r\nsucceeded to his father's throne, all your melancholy left you at\r\nonce. For what may you not promise yourself from a Prince, with whose\r\nextraordinary and almost Divine character you are well acquainted....\r\nBut when you know what a hero he now shows himself, how wisely he\r\nbehaves, what a lover he is of justice and goodness, what affection he\r\nbears to the learned, I will venture to swear that you will need no\r\nwings to make you fly to behold this new and auspicious star. If you\r\ncould see how all the world here is rejoicing in the possession of so\r\ngreat a Prince, how his life is all their desire, you could not\r\ncontain your tears for joy. The heavens laugh, the earth exults, all\r\nthings are full of milk, of honey, of nectar! Avarice is expelled the\r\ncountry. Liberality scatters wealth with a bounteous hand. Our     (p. 041)\r\nKing does not desire gold or gems or precious metals, but virtue,\r\nglory, immortality.\" The picture is overdrawn for modern taste, but\r\nmaking due allowance for Mountjoy's turgid efforts to emulate his\r\nmaster's eloquence, enough remains to indicate the impression made by\r\nHenry on a peer of liberal education. His unrivalled skill in national\r\nsports and martial exercises appealed at least as powerfully to the\r\nmass of his people. In archery, in wrestling, in joust and in tourney,\r\nas well as in the tennis court or on the hunting field, Henry was a\r\nmatch for the best in his kingdom. None could draw a bow, tame a\r\nsteed, or shiver a lance more deftly than he, and his single-handed\r\ntournaments on horse and foot with his brother-in-law, the Duke of\r\nSuffolk, are likened by one who watched them to the combats of\r\nAchilles and Hector. These are no mere trifles below the dignity of\r\nhistory; they help to explain the extraordinary hold Henry obtained\r\nover popular imagination. Suppose there ascended the throne to-day a\r\nyoung prince, the hero of the athletic world, the finest oar, the best\r\nbat, the crack marksman of his day, it is easy to imagine the\r\nenthusiastic support he would receive from thousands of his people who\r\ncare much for sport, and nothing at all for politics. Suppose also\r\nthat that prince were endowed with the iron will, the instinctive\r\ninsight into the hearts of his people, the profound aptitude for\r\ngovernment that Henry VIII. displayed, he would be a rash man who\r\nwould guarantee even now the integrity of parliamentary power or the\r\ncontinuance of cabinet rule. In those days, with thirty years of civil\r\nwar and fifteen more of conspiracy fresh in men's minds, with no\r\nalternative to anarchy save Henry VIII., with a peerage fallen     (p. 042)\r\nfrom its high estate, and a Parliament almost lost to respect, royal\r\nautocracy was not a thing to dread or distrust. \"If a lion knew his\r\nstrength,\" said Sir Thomas More of his master to Cromwell, \"it were\r\nhard for any man to rule him.\" Henry VIII. had the strength of a lion;\r\nit remains to be seen how soon he learnt it, and what use he made of\r\nthat strength when he discovered the secret.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 77: F.M. Nichols, _Epistles of Erasmus_,\r\n                   i., 457.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.                                                       (p. 043)\r\n\r\nTHE APPRENTICESHIP OF HENRY VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuietly and peacefully, without a threat from abroad or a murmur at\r\nhome, the crown, which his father had won amid the storm and stress of\r\nthe field of battle, devolved upon Henry VIII. With an eager profusion\r\nof zeal Ferdinand of Aragon placed at Henry's disposal his army, his\r\nfleet, his personal services.[78] There was no call for this sacrifice.\r\nFor generations there had been no such tranquil demise of the crown.\r\nNot a ripple disturbed the surface of affairs as the old King lay sick\r\nin April, 1509, in Richmond Palace at Sheen. By his bedside stood his\r\nonly surviving son; and to him the dying monarch addressed his last\r\nwords of advice. He desired him to complete his marriage with Catherine,\r\nhe exhorted him to defend the Church, and to make war on the infidel;\r\nhe commended to him his faithful councillors, and is believed to have\r\nurged upon him the execution of De la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, the White\r\nRose of England. On the 22nd he was dead. A fortnight later the funeral\r\nprocession wended its way from Sheen to St. Paul's, where the illustrious\r\nJohn Fisher, cardinal and martyr, preached the _eloge_. Thence it  (p. 044)\r\npassed down the Strand, between hedges and willows clad in the fresh\r\ngreen of spring, to\r\n\r\n      That acre sown indeed\r\n  With the richest, royallest seed\r\n  That the earth did e'er drink in.\r\n\r\nThere, in the vault beneath the chapel in Westminster Abbey, which\r\nbears his name and testifies to his magnificence in building, Henry\r\nVII. was laid to rest beside his Queen; dwelling, says Bacon, \"more\r\nrichly dead in the monument of his tomb than he did alive in Richmond\r\nor any of his palaces\". For years before and after, Torrigiano, the\r\nrival of Buonarotti, wrought at its \"matchless altar,\" not a stone of\r\nwhich survived the Puritan fury of the civil war.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 78: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 4.]\r\n\r\nOn the day of his father's death, or the next, the new King removed\r\nfrom Richmond Palace to the Tower, whence, on 23rd April, was dated\r\nthe first official act of his reign. He confirmed in ampler form the\r\ngeneral pardon granted a few days before by Henry VII.; but the ampler\r\nform was no bar to the exemption of fourscore offenders from the act\r\nof grace.[79] Foremost among them were the three brothers De la Pole,\r\nSir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley. The exclusion of Empson and\r\nDudley from the pardon was more popular than the pardon itself. If\r\nanything could have enhanced Henry's favour with his subjects, it was\r\nthe condign punishment of the tools of his father's extortion. Their\r\ndeath was none the less welcome for being unjust. They were not merely\r\nrefused pardon and brought to the block; a more costly concession was\r\nmade when their bonds for the payment of loans were cancelled.[80]\r\nTheir victims, so runs the official record, had been \"without      (p. 045)\r\nany ground or matter of truth, by the undue means of certain of the\r\ncouncil of our said late father, thereunto driven contrary to law,\r\nreason and good conscience, to the manifest charge and peril of the\r\nsoul of our said late father\".\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 79: _L. and P._, i., 2, 12.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 80: _Cf. L. and P._, i., 1004.]\r\n\r\nIf filial piety demanded the delivery of his father's soul from peril,\r\nit counselled no less the fulfilment of his dying requests, and the\r\narrangements for Catherine's marriage were hurried on with an almost\r\nindecent haste. The instant he heard rumours of Henry VII.'s death,\r\nFerdinand sent warning to his envoy in England that Louis of France\r\nand others would seek by all possible means to break off the match.[81]\r\nTo further it, he would withdraw his objections to the union of Charles\r\nand Mary; and a few days later he wrote again to remove any scruples\r\nHenry might entertain about marrying his deceased brother's wife;\r\nwhile to Catherine herself he declared with brutal frankness that she\r\nwould get no other husband than Henry.[82] All his paternal anxiety\r\nmight have been spared. Long before Ferdinand's persuasions could\r\nreach Henry's ears, he had made up his mind to consummate the marriage.\r\nHe would not, he wrote to Margaret of Savoy,[83] disobey his father's\r\ncommands, reinforced as they were by the dispensation of the Pope and\r\nby the friendship between the two families contracted by his sister\r\nMary's betrothal to Catherine's nephew Charles. There were other\r\nreasons besides those he alleged. A council trained by Henry VII. was\r\nloth to lose the gold of Catherine's dower; it was of the utmost\r\nimportance to strengthen at once the royal line; and a full-blooded\r\nyouth of Henry's temperament was not likely to repel a comely      (p. 046)\r\nwife ready to his hand, when the dictates of his father's policy no\r\nlonger stood between them. So on 11th June, barely a month after Henry\r\nVII.'s obsequies, the marriage, big with destinies, of Henry VIII. and\r\nCatherine of Aragon was privately solemnised by Archbishop Warham \"in\r\nthe Queen's closet\" at Greenwich.[84] On the same day the commission\r\nof claims was appointed for the King's and Queen's coronation. A week\r\nthen sufficed for its business, and on Sunday, 24th June, the Abbey\r\nwas the scene of a second State function within three months. Its\r\nsplendour and display were emblematic of the coming reign. Warham\r\nplaced the crown on the King's head; the people cried, \"Yea, yea!\" in\r\na loud voice when asked if they would have Henry as King; Sir Robert\r\nDymock performed the office of champion; and a banquet, jousts and\r\ntourneys concluded the ceremonies.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 81: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 3.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 82: _Ibid._, ii., 8, 15.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 83: _L. and P._, i., 224.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 84: _L. and P._, iv., 5774.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough he had wedded a wife and been crowned a king, Henry was as yet\r\nlittle more than a boy. A powerful mind ripens slowly in a vigorous\r\nframe, and Henry's childish precocity had given way before a youthful\r\ndevotion to physical sports. He was no prodigy of early development.\r\nHis intellect, will and character were of a gradual, healthier growth;\r\nthey were not matured for many years after he came to the throne. He\r\nwas still in his eighteenth year; and like most young Englishmen of\r\nmeans and muscle, his interests centred rather in the field than in\r\nthe study. Youth sat on the prow and pleasure at the helm. \"Continual\r\nfeasting\" was the phrase in which Catherine described their early married\r\nlife. In the winter evenings there were masks and comedies, romps  (p. 047)\r\nand revels, in which Henry himself, Bessie Blount and other young\r\nladies of his Court played parts.[85] In the spring and summer there\r\nwere archery and tennis. Music, we are told, was practised day and\r\nnight. Two months after his accession Henry wrote to Ferdinand that he\r\ndiverted himself with jousts, birding, hunting, and other innocent and\r\nhonest pastimes, in visiting various parts of his kingdom, but that he\r\ndid not therefore neglect affairs of State.[86] Possibly he was as\r\nassiduous in his duties as modern university athletes in their studies;\r\nthe neglect was merely comparative. But Ferdinand's ambassador remarked\r\non Henry's aversion to business, and his councillors complained that\r\nhe cared only for the pleasures of his age. Two days a week, said the\r\nSpaniard, were devoted to single combats on foot, initiated in imitation\r\nof the heroes of romance, Amadis and Lancelot;[87] and if Henry's\r\nother innocent and honest pastimes were equally exacting, his view of\r\nthe requirements of State may well have been modest. From the earliest\r\ndays of his reign the general outline of policy was framed in accord\r\nwith his sentiments, and he was probably consulted on most questions\r\nof importance. But it was not always so; in August, 1509, Louis XII.\r\nacknowledged a letter purporting to come from the English King with a\r\nrequest for friendship and peace. \"Who wrote this letter?\" burst out\r\nHenry. \"I ask peace of the King of France, who dare not look me in the\r\nface, still less make war on me!\"[88] His pride at the age of eighteen\r\nwas not less than his ignorance of what passed in his name. He had (p. 048)\r\nyet to learn the secret that painful and laborious mastery of detail\r\nis essential to him who aspires not merely to reign but to rule; and\r\nmatters of detail in administration and diplomacy were still left in\r\nhis ministers' hands.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 85: _L. and P._, vol. ii., p. 1461.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 86: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 19.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 87: _Ibid._, ii., 44, 45.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 88: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 11.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Empson and Dudley, Henry made little or no change\r\nin the council his father bequeathed him. Official precedence appertained\r\nto his Chancellor, Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury. Like most of\r\nHenry VII.'s prelates, he received his preferment in the Church as a\r\nreward for services to the State. Much of the diplomatic work of the\r\nprevious reign had passed through his hands; he helped to arrange the\r\nmarriage of Arthur and Catherine, and was employed in the vain attempt\r\nto obtain Margaret of Savoy as a bride for Henry VII. As Archbishop he\r\ncrowned and married Henry VIII., and as Chancellor he delivered\r\norations at the opening of the young King's first three Parliaments.[89]\r\nThey are said to have given general satisfaction, but apart from them,\r\nWarham, for some unknown reason, took little part in political\r\nbusiness. So far as Henry can be said at this time to have had a Prime\r\nMinister, that title belongs to Fox, his Lord Privy Seal and Bishop of\r\nWinchester. Fox had been even more active than Warham in politics, and\r\nmore closely linked with the personal fortunes of the two Tudor kings.\r\nHe had shared the exile of Henry of Richmond; the treaty of Etaples,\r\nthe Intercursus Magnus, the marriage of Henry's elder daughter to\r\nJames IV., and the betrothal of his younger to Charles, were largely\r\nthe work of his hands. Malicious gossip described him as willing to\r\nconsent to his own father's death to serve the turn of his king,   (p. 049)\r\nand a better founded belief ascribed to his wit the invention of\r\n\"Morton's fork\".[90] He was Chancellor of Cambridge in 1500, as Warham\r\nwas of Oxford, but won more enduring fame by founding the college of\r\nCorpus Christi in the university over which the Archbishop presided.\r\nHe had baptised Henry VIII. and advocated his marriage to Catherine;\r\nand to him the King extended the largest share in his confidence.\r\nBadoer, the Venetian ambassador, called him \"alter rex,\"[91] and\r\nCarroz, the Spaniard, said Henry trusted him most; but Henry was not\r\nblind to the failings of his most intimate councillors, and he warned\r\nCarroz that the Bishop of Winchester was, as his name implied, a fox\r\nindeed.[92] A third prelate, Ruthal of Durham, divided with Fox the\r\nchief business of State; and these clerical advisers were supposed to\r\nbe eager to guide Henry's footsteps in the paths of peace, and\r\ncounteract the more adventurous tendencies of their lay colleagues.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 89: _L. and P._, i., 811, 2082; ii.,\r\n                   114.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 90: _D.N.B._, xx., 152.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 91: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 63.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 92: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 44.]\r\n\r\nAt the head of the latter stood Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, soon to\r\nbe rewarded for his victory at Flodden by his restoration to the\r\ndukedom of Norfolk. He and his son, the third duke, were Lord High\r\nTreasurers throughout Henry's reign; but jealousy of their past, Tudor\r\ndistrust of their rank, or personal limitations, impaired the\r\nauthority that would otherwise have attached to their official\r\nposition; and Henry never trusted them as he did ministers whom he\r\nhimself had raised from the dust. Surrey had served under Edward IV.\r\nand Richard III.; he had fought against Henry at Bosworth, been\r\nattainted and sent to the Tower. Reflecting that it was better to  (p. 050)\r\nbe a Tudor official at Court than a baronial magnate in prison, he\r\nsubmitted to the King and was set up as a beacon to draw his peers\r\nfrom their feudal ways. The rest of the council were men of little\r\ndistinction. Shrewsbury, the Lord High Steward, was a pale reflex of\r\nSurrey, and illustrious in nought but descent. Charles Somerset, Lord\r\nHerbert, who was Chamberlain and afterwards Earl of Worcester, was a\r\nBeaufort bastard,[93] and may have derived some little influence from\r\nhis harmless kinship with Henry VIII. Lovell, the Treasurer, Poynings\r\nthe Controller of the Household, and Harry Marney, Chancellor of the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster, were tried and trusty officials. Bishop Fisher was\r\ngreat as a Churchman, a scholar, a patron of learning, but not as a\r\nman of affairs; while Buckingham, the only duke in England, and his\r\nbrother, the Earl of Wiltshire, were rigidly excluded by dynastic\r\njealousy from all share in political authority.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 93: He is a link in the hereditary chain\r\n                   which began with Beauforts, Dukes of Somerset and\r\n                   ended in Somersets, Dukes of Beaufort.]\r\n\r\nThe most persistent of Henry's advisers was none of his council. He\r\nwas Ferdinand the Catholic, King of Aragon; and to his inspiration has\r\nbeen ascribed[94] the course of foreign policy during the first five\r\nyears of his son-in-law's reign. He worked through his daughter; the\r\nonly thing she valued in life, wrote Catherine a month after her\r\nmarriage, was her father's confidence. When Membrilla was recalled\r\nbecause he failed to satisfy Catherine's somewhat exacting temper, she\r\nwas herself formally commissioned to act in his place as           (p. 051)\r\nFerdinand's ambassador at Henry's Court; Henry was begged to give her\r\nimplicit credence and communicate with Spain through her mediation!\r\n\"These kingdoms of _your_ highness,\" she wrote to her father, \"are in\r\ngreat tranquillity.\"[95] Well might Ferdinand congratulate himself on\r\nthe result of her marriage, and the addition of fresh, to his already\r\nextensive, domains. He needed them all to ensure the success of his\r\nfar-reaching schemes. His eldest grandson, Charles, was heir not only\r\nto Castile and Aragon, Naples and the Indies, which were to come to\r\nhim from his mother, Ferdinand's imbecile daughter, Juana, but to\r\nBurgundy and Austria, the lands of his father, Philip, and of Philip's\r\nfather, the Emperor Maximilian. This did not satisfy Ferdinand's\r\ngrasping ambition; he sought to carve out for his second grandson,\r\nnamed after himself, a kingdom in Northern Italy.[96] On the Duchy of\r\nMilan, the republics of Venice, Genoa and Florence, his greedy eyes\r\nwere fixed. Once conquered, they would bar the path of France to\r\nNaples; compensated by these possessions, the younger Ferdinand might\r\nresign his share in the Austrian inheritance to Charles; while Charles\r\nhimself was to marry the only daughter of the King of Hungary, add\r\nthat to his other dominions, and revive the empire of Charlemagne. (p. 052)\r\nPartly with these objects in view, partly to draw off the scent from\r\nhis own track, Ferdinand had, in 1508, raised the hue and cry after\r\nVenice. Pope and Emperor, France and Spain, joined in the chase, but\r\nof all the parties to the league of Cambrai, Louis XII. was in a position\r\nto profit the most. His victory over Venice at Agnadello (14th May,\r\n1509), secured him Milan and Venetian territory as far as the Mincio;\r\nit also dimmed the prospects of Ferdinand's Italian scheme and threatened\r\nhis hold on Naples; but the Spanish King was restrained from open\r\nopposition to France by the fact that Louis was still mediating\r\nbetween him and Maximilian on their claims to the administration of\r\nCastile, the realm of their daughter and daughter-in-law, Juana.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 94: By Bergenroth in his prefaces to the\r\n                   _Calendar of Spanish State Papers_.

The young King entered the arena of Europe, a child\r\nof generous impulse in a throng of hoary intriguers--Ferdinand,\r\nMaximilian, Louis XII., Julius II.--each of whom was nearly three\r\ntimes his age. He was shocked to see them leagued to spoil a petty\r\nrepublic, a republic, too, which had been for ages the bulwark of\r\nChristendom against the Turk and from time immemorial the ally of\r\nEngland. Venice had played no small part in the revival of letters\r\nwhich appealed so strongly to Henry's intellectual sympathies. Scholars\r\nand physicians from Venice, or from equally threatened Italian\r\nrepublics, frequented his Court and Cabinet. Venetian merchants\r\ndeveloped the commerce of London; Venetian galleys called twice a year\r\nat Southampton on their way to and from Flanders, and their trade  (p. 053)\r\nwas a source of profit to both nations. Inevitably Henry's sympathies\r\nwent out to the sore-pressed republic. They were none the less strong\r\nbecause the chief of the spoilers was France, for Henry and his people\r\nwere imbued with an inborn antipathy to everything French.[97] Before\r\nhe came to the throne he was reported to be France's enemy; and\r\nspeculations were rife as to the chances of his invading it and\r\nimitating the exploits of his ancestor Henry V. It needed no\r\npersuasion from Ferdinand to induce him to intervene in favour of\r\nVenice. Within a few weeks of his accession he refused to publish the\r\npapal bull which cast the halo of crusaders over the bandits of\r\nCambrai. The day after his coronation he deplored to Badoer Louis'\r\nvictory at Agnadello, and a week later he wrote to the sovereigns of\r\nEurope urging the injustice of their Venetian crusade. In September he\r\nsent Bainbridge, Cardinal-Archbishop of York, to reside at the Papal\r\nCourt, and watch over the interests of Venice as well as of England.\r\n\"Italy,\" wrote Badoer, \"was entirely rescued from the barbarians by\r\nthe movements of the English King; and, but for that, Ferdinand would\r\nhave done nothing.\"[98] Henry vainly endeavoured to persuade\r\nMaximilian, the Venetian's lifelong foe, to accept arbitration; but he\r\nsucceeded in inducing the Doge to make his peace with the Pope, and\r\nJulius to remove his ecclesiastical censures. To Ferdinand he declared\r\nthat Venice must be preserved as a wall against the Turk, and he\r\nhinted that Ferdinand's own dominions in Italy would, if Venice were\r\ndestroyed, \"be unable to resist the ambitious designs of certain   (p. 054)\r\nChristian princes\".[99] The danger was as patent to Julius and\r\nFerdinand as it was to Henry; and as soon as Ferdinand had induced\r\nLouis to give a favourable verdict in his suit with the Emperor, the\r\nCatholic King was ready to join Henry and the Pope in a league of\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 97: _Ven. Cal._, i., 941, 942, 945; ii.,\r\n                   1.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 98: _L. and P._, i., 922, 932, 3333;\r\n                   _Ven. Cal._, ii., 5, 7, 9, 19-22, 28, 33, 39, 40,\r\n                   45, 51.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 99: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 23.]\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of Venetian, Spanish and papal instigations to \"recover\r\nhis noble inheritance in France,\" in spite of his own indignation at\r\nthe treatment of Venice, and the orders issued in the first year of\r\nhis reign to his subjects to furnish themselves with weapons of war,\r\nfor which the long peace had left them unprepared,[100] Henry, or the\r\npeace party in his council, was unwilling to resort to the arbitrament\r\nof arms. He renewed his father's treaties not only with other powers,\r\nbut, much to the disgust of Ferdinand, Venice and the Pope, with Louis\r\nhimself. His first martial exploit, apart from 1,500 archers whom he\r\nwas bound by treaty to send to aid the Netherlands against the Duke of\r\nGuelders,[101] was an expedition for the destruction of the enemies of\r\nthe faith.[102] Such an expedition, he once said, he owed to God for\r\nhis peaceful accession; at another time he declared[103] that he\r\ncherished, like an heirloom, the ardour against the infidel which he\r\ninherited from his father. He repressed that ardour, it must be added,\r\nwith as much success as Henry VII.; and apart from this one youthful\r\nindiscretion, he did not suffer his ancestral zeal to escape into\r\naction. His generous illusions soon vanished before the sordid\r\nrealities of European statecraft; and the defence of Christendom   (p. 055)\r\nbecame with him, as with others, a hollow pretence, a diplomatic\r\nfiction, the infinite varieties of which age could not wither nor\r\ncustom stale. Did a monarch wish for peace? Peace at once was\r\nimperative to enable Christian princes to combine against the Turk.\r\nDid he desire war? War became a disagreeable necessity to restrain the\r\nambition of Christian princes who, \"worse than the infidel,\" disturbed\r\nthe peace of Christendom and opened a door for the enemies of the\r\nChurch. Nor did the success of Henry's first crusade encourage him to\r\npersist in similar efforts. It sailed from Plymouth in May, 1511, to\r\njoin in Ferdinand's attack on the Moors, but it had scarcely landed\r\nwhen bickerings broke out between the Christian allies, and Ferdinand\r\ninformed the English commanders that he had made peace with the\r\nInfidel, to gird his loins for war with the Most Christian King.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 100: _L. and P._, i., 679.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 101: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 16; _L. and P._,\r\n                   i., 1740.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 102: _L. and P._, i., 1531.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 103: _Ibid._, ii., 4688; _Ven. Cal._,\r\n                   ii., 178.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their preparation against infidels, so runs the\r\npreamble to the treaty in which Henry and Ferdinand signified their\r\nadhesion to the Holy League, they heard that Louis was besieging the\r\nPope in Bologna.[104] The thought of violent hands being laid on the\r\nVicar of Christ stirred Henry to a depth of indignation which no\r\ninjuries practised against a temporal power could rouse. His ingenuous\r\ndeference to the Papacy was in singular contrast to the contempt with\r\nwhich it was treated by more experienced sovereigns, and they traded\r\non the weight which Henry always attached to the words of the Pope. He\r\nhad read Maximilian grave lectures on his conduct in countenancing the\r\nschismatic _conciliabulum_ assembled by Louis at Pisa.[105] He wrote\r\nto Bainbridge at the Papal Court that he was ready to sacrifice goods,\r\nlife and kingdom for the Pope and the Church;[106] and to the      (p. 056)\r\nEmperor that at the beginning of his reign he thought of nothing else\r\nthan an expedition against the Infidel. But now he was called by the\r\nPope and the danger of the Church in another direction; and he\r\nproceeded to denounce the impiety and schism of the French and their\r\natrocious deeds in Italy. He joined Ferdinand in requiring Louis to\r\ndesist from his impious work. Louis turned a deaf ear to their\r\ndemands; and in November, 1511, they bound themselves to defend the\r\nChurch against all aggression and make war upon the aggressor.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 104: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 59.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 105: _L. and P._, i., 1828.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 106: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 177.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis reversal of the pacific policy which had marked the first two and\r\na half years of Henry's reign was not exclusively due to the King's\r\nzeal for the Church. The clerical party of peace in his council was\r\nnow divided by the appearance of an ecclesiastic who was far more\r\nremarkable than any of his colleagues, and to whose turbulence and\r\nenergy the boldness of English policy must, henceforth, for many years\r\nbe mainly ascribed. Thomas Wolsey had been appointed Henry's almoner\r\nat the beginning of his reign, but he exercised no apparent influence\r\nin public affairs. It was not till 1511 that he joined the council,\r\nthough during the interval he must have been gradually building up his\r\nascendancy over the King's mind. To Wolsey, restlessly ambitious for\r\nhimself, for Henry, and England, was attributed the responsibility for\r\nthe sudden adoption of a spirited foreign policy; and it was in the\r\npreparations for the war of 1512 that his marvellous industry and\r\ngrasp of detail first found full scope.\r\n\r\nThe main attack of the English and Spanish monarchs was to be on   (p. 057)\r\nGuienne,[107] and in May, 1512, Henry went down to Southampton to\r\nspeed the departing fleet.[108] It sailed from Cowes under Dorset's\r\ncommand on 3rd June, and a week later the army disembarked on the\r\ncoast of Guipuscoa.[109] There it remained throughout the torrid\r\nsummer, awaiting the Spanish King's forces to co-operate in the\r\ninvasion of France. But Ferdinand was otherwise occupied. Navarre was\r\nnot mentioned in the treaty with Henry, but Navarre was what Ferdinand\r\nhad in his mind. It was then an independent kingdom, surrounded on\r\nthree sides by Spanish territory, and an easy prey which would serve\r\nto unite all Spain beyond the Pyrenees under Ferdinand's rule. Under\r\npretence of restoring Guienne to the English crown, Dorset's army had\r\nbeen enticed to Passages, and there it was used as a screen against\r\nthe French, behind which Ferdinand calmly proceeded to conquer\r\nNavarre. It was, he said, impossible to march into France with Navarre\r\nunsubdued in his rear. Navarre was at peace, but it might join the\r\nFrench, and he invited Dorset to help in securing the prey. Dorset\r\nrefused to exceed his commission, but the presence of his army at\r\nPassages was admitted by the Spaniards to be \"quite providential,\"[110]\r\nas it prevented the French from assisting Navarre. English indignation\r\nwas loud and deep; men and officers vowed that, but for Henry's\r\ndispleasure, they would have called to account the perfidious King.\r\nCondemned to inactivity, the troops almost mutinied; they found it\r\nimpossible to live on their wages of sixpence a day (equivalent now to\r\nat least six shillings), drank Spanish wine as if it were English  (p. 058)\r\nbeer, and died of dysentery like flies in the autumn. Discipline\r\nrelaxed; drill was neglected. Still Ferdinand tarried, and in October,\r\nseeing no hope of an attempt on Guienne that year, the army took\r\nmatters into its own hands and embarked for England.[111]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 107: _L. and P._, i., 1980; _Sp.

The financial accounts for\r\n                   the expedition are in _L. and P._, i., 3762.]\r\n\r\nHenry's first military enterprise had ended in disgrace and disaster.\r\nThe repute of English soldiers, dimmed by long peace, was now further\r\ntarnished. Henry's own envoys complained of the army's insubordination,\r\nits impatience of the toils, and inexperience of the feats, of war;\r\nand its ignominious return exposed him to the taunts of both friends\r\nand foes. He had been on the point of ordering it home, when it came\r\nof its own accord; but the blow to his authority was not, on that\r\naccount, less severe. His irritation was not likely to be soothed when\r\nhe realised the extent to which he had been duped by his father-in-law.\r\nFerdinand was loud in complaints and excuses.[112] September and\r\nOctober were, he said, the proper months for a campaign in Guienne,\r\nand he was marching to join the English army at the moment of its\r\ndesertion. In reality, it had served his purpose to perfection. Its\r\npresence had diverted French levies from Italy, and enabled him,\r\nunmolested, to conquer Navarre. With that he was content. Why should\r\nhe wish to see Henry in Guienne? He was too shrewd to involve his own\r\nforces in that hopeless adventure, and the departure of the English\r\nfurnished him with an excuse for entering into secret negotiations\r\nwith Louis. His methods were eloquent of sixteenth-century         (p. 059)\r\ndiplomacy. He was, he ordered Carroz to tell Henry many months\r\nlater,[113] when concealment was no longer possible or necessary,\r\nsending a holy friar to his daughter in England; the friar's health\r\ndid not permit of his going by sea; so he went through France, and was\r\ntaken prisoner. Hearing of his fame for piety, the French Queen desired\r\nhis ghostly advice, and took the opportunity of the interview to\r\npersuade the friar to return to Spain with proposals of peace.\r\nFerdinand was suddenly convinced that death was at hand; his confessor\r\nexhorted him to forgive and make peace with his enemies. This work of\r\npiety he could not in conscience neglect. So he agreed to a twelvemonth's\r\ntruce, which secured Navarre. In spite of his conscience he would\r\nnever have consented, had he not felt that the truce was really in\r\nHenry's interests. But what weighed with him most was, he said, the\r\nreformation of the Church. That should be Henry's first and noblest\r\nwork; he could render no greater service to God. No reformation was\r\npossible without peace, and so long as the Church was unreformed, wars\r\namong princes would never cease.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 112: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 68, 70, 72; _cf._\r\n                   _L. and P._, i., 3350, 3356.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 113: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 89, 118; _L. and\r\n                   P._, i., 3839.]\r\n\r\nSuch reasoning, he thought, would appeal to the pious and unsophisticated\r\nHenry. To other sovereigns he used arguments more suited to their\r\nexperience of his diplomacy. He told Maximilian[114] that his main\r\ndesire was to serve the Emperor's interests, to put a curb on the\r\nItalians, and to frustrate their design of driving himself, Louis and\r\nMaximilian across the Alps. But the most monumental falsehood he\r\nreserved for the Pope; his ambassador at the Papal Court was to    (p. 060)\r\nassure Julius that he had failed in his efforts to concert with Henry\r\na joint invasion of France, that Henry was not in earnest over the war\r\nand that he had actually made a truce[115] with France. This had\r\nenabled Louis to pour fresh troops into Italy, and compelled him,\r\nFerdinand, to consult his own interests and make peace! Two days later\r\nhe was complaining to Louis that Henry refused to join in the\r\ntruce.[116] To punish Henry for his refusal he was willing to aid\r\nLouis against him, but he would prefer to settle the differences\r\nbetween the French and the English kings by a still more treacherous\r\nexpedient. Julius was to be induced to give a written promise that, if\r\nthe points at issue were submitted to his arbitration, he would\r\npronounce no verdict till it had been secretly sanctioned by Ferdinand\r\nand Louis. This promise obtained, Louis was publicly to appeal to the\r\nPope; Henry's devotion to the Church would prevent his refusing the\r\nSupreme Pontiff's mediation; if he did, ecclesiastical censures could\r\nbe invoked against him.[117] Such was the plot Ferdinand was hatching\r\nfor the benefit of his daughter's husband. The Catholic King had ever\r\ndeceit in his heart and the name of God on his lips. He was accused by\r\na rival of having cheated him twice; the charge was repeated to\r\nFerdinand. \"He lies,\" he broke out, \"I cheated him three times.\" He\r\nwas faithful to one principle only, self-aggrandisement by fair means\r\nor foul. His favourite scheme was a kingdom in Northern Italy; but in\r\nthe way of its realisation his own overreaching ambition placed an\r\ninsuperable bar. Italy had been excluded from his truce with France to\r\nleave him free to pursue that design;[118] but in July, 1512, the  (p. 061)\r\nItalians already suspected his motives, and a papal legate declared\r\nthat they no more wished to see Milan Spanish than French.[119] In the\r\nfollowing November, Spanish troops in the pay and alliance of Venice\r\ndrove the French out of Brescia. By the terms of the Holy League, it\r\nshould have been restored to its owner, the Venetian Republic.\r\nFerdinand kept it himself; it was to form the nucleus of his North\r\nItalian dominion. Venice at once took alarm and made a compact with\r\nFrance which kept the Spaniards at bay until after Ferdinand's\r\ndeath.[120] The friendship between Venice and France severed that\r\nbetween France and the Emperor; and, in 1513, the war went on with a\r\nrearrangement of partners, Henry and Maximilian on one side,[121]\r\nagainst France and Venice on the other, with Ferdinand secretly trying\r\nto trick them all.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 114: _Ibid._, ii., 96, 101.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 115: _Sp.

The\r\n                   league between Henry and Maximilian was concluded\r\n                   5th April, 1513; Carroz ratified it on Ferdinand's\r\n                   behalf on 25th April, though Ferdinand had already\r\n                   signed a truce with France. A good instance of\r\n                   Ferdinand's duplicity may be found in _Sp. Cal._,\r\n                   ii., 104, 207; in the former he is asking for the\r\n                   hand of Renee for his grandson Ferdinand, in the\r\n                   latter he tells the Pope that the report that he\r\n                   had made this request was pure invention.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor many months Henry knew not, or refused to credit, his father-in-law's\r\nperfidy. To outward appearance, the Spanish King was as eager as ever\r\nfor the war in Guienne. He was urging Henry to levy 6,000 Germans  (p. 062)\r\nto serve for that purpose in conjunction with Spanish forces; and, in\r\nApril, Carroz, in ignorance of his master's real intentions, signed on\r\nhis behalf a treaty for the joint invasion of France.[122] This forced\r\nthe Catholic King to reveal his hand. He refused his ratification;[123]\r\nnow he declared the conquest of Guienne to be a task of such magnitude\r\nthat preparations must be complete before April, a date already past;\r\nand he recommended Henry to come into the truce with Louis, the\r\nexistence of which he had now to confess. Henry had not yet fathomed\r\nthe depths; he even appealed to Ferdinand's feelings and pathetically\r\nbesought him, as a good father, not to forsake him entirely.[124] But\r\nin vain; his father-in-law deserted him at his sorest hour of need. To\r\nmake peace was out of the question. England's honour had suffered a\r\nstain that must at all costs be removed. No king with an atom of\r\nspirit would let the dawn of his reign be clouded by such an admission\r\nof failure. Wolsey was there to stiffen his temper in case of need;\r\nwith him it was almost a matter of life and death to retrieve the\r\ndisaster. His credit was pledged in the war. In their moments of anger\r\nunder the Spanish sun, the English commanders had loudly imputed to\r\nWolsey the origin of the war and the cause of all the mischief.[125]\r\nSurrey, for whose banishment from Court the new favourite had\r\nexpressed to Fox a wish, and other \"great men\" at home, repeated the\r\ncharge.[126] Had Wolsey failed to bring honour with peace, his name\r\nwould not have been numbered among the greatest of England's\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 122: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 101.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 123: _Ib._, ii., 118, 122.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 124: _Ib._, ii., 125.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 125: _L. and P._, i., 3356, 3451.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 126: _Ib._, i., 3443.]\r\n\r\nHenry's temper required no spur. Tudors never flinched in the face (p. 063)\r\nof danger, and nothing could have made Henry so resolved to go on as\r\nFerdinand's desertion and advice to desist. He was prepared to avenge\r\nhis army in person. There were to be no expeditions to distant shores;\r\nthere was to be war in the Channel, where Englishmen were at home on\r\nthe sea; and Calais was to be the base of an invasion of France over\r\nsoil worn by the tramp of English troops. In March, 1513, Henry, to\r\nwhom the navy was a weapon, a plaything, a passion, watched his fleet\r\nsail down the Thames; its further progress was told him in letters\r\nfrom its gallant admiral, Sir Edmund Howard, who had been strictly\r\ncharged to inform the King of the minutest details in the behaviour of\r\nevery one of the ships.[127] Never had such a display of naval force\r\nleft the English shores; twenty-four ships ranging downwards from the\r\n1,600 tons of the _Henry Imperial_, bore nearly 5,000 marines and\r\n3,000 mariners.[128] The French dared not venture out, while Howard\r\nswept the Channel, and sought them in their ports. Brest was\r\nblockaded. A squadron of Mediterranean galleys coming to its relief\r\nanchored in the shallow water off Conquet. Howard determined to cut\r\nthem out; he grappled and boarded their admiral's galley. The\r\ngrappling was cut away, his boat swept out in the tide, and Howard,\r\nleft unsupported, was thrust overboard by the Frenchmen's pikes.[129]\r\nHis death was regarded as a national disaster, but he had retrieved\r\nEngland's reputation for foolhardy valour.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 127: _L. and P._, i., 3809, 3820.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 128: _Ib._, i., 3977.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 129: _Ib._, i., 4005; see also _The War\r\n                   of 1512-13_ (Navy Records Society) where the\r\n                   documents are printed in full.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Henry's army was gathering at Calais.[130] On 30th      (p. 064)\r\nJune, at 7 P.M., the King himself landed. Before his departure, the\r\nunfortunate Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, was brought to the\r\nblock for an alleged correspondence with his brother in Louis'\r\nservice, but really because rumours were rife of Louis' intention to\r\nproclaim the White Rose as King of England.[131] On 21st July, Henry\r\nleft Calais to join his army, which had already advanced into French\r\nterritory. Heavy rains impeded its march and added to its discomfort.\r\nHenry, we are told, did not put off his clothes, but rode round the\r\ncamp at three in the morning, cheering his men with the remark, \"Well,\r\ncomrades, now that we have suffered in the beginning, fortune promises\r\nus better things, God willing\".[132] Near Ardres some German\r\nmercenaries, of whom there were 8,000 with Henry's forces, pillaged\r\nthe church; Henry promptly had three of them hanged. On 1st August the\r\narmy sat down before Therouanne; on the 10th, the Emperor arrived to\r\nserve as a private at a hundred crowns a day under the English\r\nbanners. Three days later a large French force arrived at Guinegate to\r\nraise the siege; a panic seized it, and the bloodless rout that\r\nfollowed was named the Battle of Spurs. Louis d'Orleans, Duc de\r\nLongueville, the famous Chevalier Bayard, and others of the noblest\r\nblood in France, were among the captives.[133] Ten days after this\r\ndefeat Therouanne surrendered; and on the 24th Henry made his      (p. 065)\r\ntriumphal entry into the first town captured by English arms since\r\nthe days of Jeanne Darc. On the 26th he removed to Guinegate, where he\r\nremained a week, \"according,\" says a curious document, \"to the laws of\r\narms, for in case any man would bid battle for the besieging and\r\ngetting of any city or town, then the winner (has) to give battle, and\r\nto abide the same certain days\".[134] No challenge was forthcoming,\r\nand on 15th September Henry besieged Tournay, then said to be the\r\nrichest city north of Paris. During the progress of the siege the Lady\r\nMargaret of Savoy, the Regent of the Netherlands, joined her father,\r\nthe Emperor, and Henry, at Lille. They discussed plans for renewing\r\nthe war next year and for the marriage of Charles and Mary. To please\r\nthe Lady Margaret and to exhibit his skill Henry played the gitteron,\r\nthe lute and the cornet, and danced and jousted before her.[135] He\r\n\"excelled every one as much in agility in breaking spears as in\r\nnobleness of stature\". Within a week Tournay fell; on 13th October\r\nHenry commenced his return, and on the 21st he re-embarked at Calais.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 130: _L. and P._, i., 3885, 3915.

Cal_., ii., 328.]\r\n\r\nTherouanne, the Battle of Spurs, and Tournay were not the only, or the\r\nmost striking, successes in this year of war. In July, Catherine, whom\r\nHenry had left as Regent in England, wrote that she was \"horribly busy\r\nwith making standards, banners, and badges\"[136] for the army in the\r\nNorth; for war with France had brought, as usual, the Scots upon the\r\nEnglish backs. James IV., though Henry's brother-in-law, preferred to\r\nbe the cat's paw of the King of France; and in August the Scots\r\nforces poured over the Border under the command of James himself.  (p. 066)\r\nEngland was prepared; and on 9th September, \"at Flodden hills,\" sang\r\nSkelton, \"our bows and bills slew all the flower of their honour\".\r\nJames IV. was left a mutilated corpse upon the field of battle.[137]\r\n\"He has paid,\" wrote Henry, \"a heavier penalty for his perfidy than we\r\nwould have wished.\" There was some justice in the charge. James was\r\nbound by treaty not to go to war with England; he had not even waited\r\nfor the Pope's answer to his request for absolution from his oath; and\r\nhis challenge to Henry, when he was in France and could not meet it,\r\nwas not a knightly deed. Henry wrote to Leo for permission to bury the\r\nexcommunicated Scottish King with royal honours in St. Paul's.[138]\r\nThe permission was granted, but the interment did not take place. In\r\nItaly, Louis fared no better; at Novara, on 6th June, the Swiss\r\ninfantry broke in pieces the grand army of France, drove the fragments\r\nacross the Alps, and restored the Duchy of Milan to the native house\r\nof Sforza.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 136: _L. and P._, i., 4398; Ellis,\r\n                   _Original Letters_, 1st ser., i., 83.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 137: _L. and P._, i., 4439, 4441, 4461;\r\n                   _cf._ popular ballads in Weber's _Flodden Field_,\r\n                   and _La Rotta de Scocese_ (Bannatyne Club).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 138: _Ven.

He styled him \"our great King\".[139] Peter Martyr, a resident\r\nat Ferdinand's Court, declared that the Spanish King was \"afraid   (p. 067)\r\nof the over-growing power of England\".[140] Another Venetian in London\r\nreported that \"were Henry ambitious of dominion like others, he would\r\nsoon give law to the world\". But, he added, \"he is good and has a good\r\ncouncil. His quarrel was a just one, he marched to free the Church, to\r\nobtain his own, and to liberate Italy from the French.\"[141] The pomp\r\nand parade of Henry's wars have, indeed, somewhat obscured the\r\nfundamentally pacific character of his reign. The correspondence of\r\nthe time bears constant witness to the peaceful tendencies of Henry\r\nand his council. \"I content myself,\" he once said to Giustinian, \"with\r\nmy own, I only wish to command my own subjects; but, on the other\r\nhand, I do not choose that any one shall have it in his power to\r\ncommand me.\"[142] On another occasion he said: \"We want all potentates\r\nto content themselves with their own territories; we are content with\r\nthis island of ours\"; and Giustinian, after four years' residence at\r\nHenry's Court, gave it as his deliberate opinion to his Government,\r\nthat Henry did not covet his neighbours' goods, was satisfied with his\r\nown dominions, and \"extremely desirous of peace\".[143] Ferdinand said,\r\nin 1513, that his pensions from France and a free hand in Scotland\r\nwere all that Henry really desired;[144] and Carroz, his ambassador,\r\nreported that Henry's councillors did not like to be at war with any\r\none.[145] Peace, they told Badoer, suited England better than\r\nwar.[146]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 139: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 340.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 140: _L. and P._, i., 4864.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 141: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 362.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 142: _L. and P._, ii., 1991.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 143: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1287; Giustinian,\r\n                   _Desp._, App., ii., 309.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 144: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 142.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 145: _Ib._, ii., 201.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 146: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 298; _cf. L. and\r\n                   P._, i., 3081.]\r\n\r\nBut Henry's actions proclaimed louder than the words of himself    (p. 068)\r\nor of others that he believed peace to be the first of English interests.\r\nHe waged no wars on the continent except against France; and though he\r\nreigned thirty-eight years, his hostilities with France were compressed\r\ninto as many months. The campaigns of 1512-13, Surrey's and Suffolk's\r\ninroads of 1522 and 1523, and Henry's invasion of 1544, represent the\r\nsum of his military operations outside Great Britain and Ireland. He\r\nacquired Tournay in 1513 and Boulogne in 1544, but the one was\r\nrestored in five years for an indemnity, and the other was to be given\r\nback in eight for a similar consideration. These facts are in curious\r\ncontrast with the high-sounding schemes of recovering the crown of\r\nFrance, which others were always suggesting to Henry, and which he,\r\nfor merely conventional reasons, was in the habit of enunciating\r\nbefore going to war; and in view of the tenacity which Henry exhibited\r\nin other respects, and the readiness with which he relinquished his\r\nregal pretensions to France, it is difficult to believe that they were\r\nany real expression of settled policy. They were, indeed, impossible\r\nof achievement, and Henry saw the fact clearly enough.[147] Modern\r\nphenomena such as huge armies sweeping over Europe, and capitals from\r\nBerlin to Moscow, Paris to Madrid, falling before them, were quite\r\nbeyond military science of the sixteenth century. Armies fought, as a\r\nrule, only in the five summer months; it was difficult enough to\r\nvictual them for even that time; and lack of commissariat or transport\r\ncrippled all the invasions of Scotland. Hertford sacked Edinburgh, (p. 069)\r\nbut he went by sea. No other capital except Rome saw an invading army.\r\nNeither Henry nor Maximilian, Ferdinand nor Charles, ever penetrated\r\nmore than a few miles into France, and French armies got no further\r\ninto Spain, the Netherlands, or Germany. Machiavelli points out that\r\nthe chief safeguard of France against the Spaniards was that the latter\r\ncould not victual their army sufficiently to pass the Pyrenees.[148]\r\nIf in Italy it was different, it was because Italy herself invited the\r\ninvaders, and was mainly under foreign dominion. Henry knew that with\r\nthe means at his disposal he could never conquer France; his claims to\r\nthe crown were transparent conventions, and he was always ready for\r\npeace in return for the _status quo_ and a money indemnity, with a\r\ntown or so for security.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 147: In 1520 he described his title \"King\r\n                   of France\" as a title given him by others which was\r\n                   \"good for nothing\" (_Ven. Cal._, iii., 45). Its\r\n                   value consisted in the pensions he received as a\r\n                   sort of commutation.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 148: Machiavelli, _Opera_, iv., 139.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that he had only achieved a small part of the conquest he\r\nprofessed to set out to accomplish was, therefore, no bar to\r\nnegotiations for peace. There were many reasons for ending the war;\r\nthe rapid diminution of his father's treasures; the accession to the\r\npapal throne of the pacific Leo in place of the warlike Julius; the\r\nabsolution of Louis as a reward for renouncing the council of Pisa;\r\nthe interruption of the trade with Venice; the attention required by\r\nScotland now that her king was Henry's infant nephew; and lastly, his\r\nbetrayal first by Ferdinand and now by the Emperor. In October, 1513,\r\nat Lille, a treaty had been drawn up binding Henry, Maximilian and\r\nFerdinand to a combined invasion of France before the following\r\nJune.[149] On 6th December, Ferdinand wrote to Henry to say he     (p. 070)\r\nhad signed the treaty. He pointed out the sacrifices he was making\r\nin so doing; he was induced to make them by considering that the war\r\nwas to be waged in the interests of the Holy Church, of Maximilian,\r\nHenry, and Catherine, and by his wish and hope to live and die in\r\nfriendship with the Emperor and the King of England. He thought,\r\nhowever, that to make sure of the assistance of God, the allies ought\r\nto bind themselves, if He gave them the victory, to undertake a\r\ngeneral war on the infidel.[150] Ferdinand seems to have imagined that\r\nhe could dupe the Almighty as easily as he hoped to cheat his allies,\r\nby a pledge which he never meant to fulfil. A fortnight after this\r\ndespatch he ordered Carroz not to ratify the treaty he himself had\r\nalready signed.[151] The reason was not far to seek. He was deluding\r\nhimself with the hope, which Louis shrewdly encouraged, that the\r\nFrench King would, after his recent reverses, fall in with the\r\nSpaniard's Italian plans.[152] Louis might even, he thought, of his\r\nown accord cede Milan and Genoa, which would annihilate the French\r\nKing's influence in Italy, and greatly facilitate the attack on\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 149: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 138, 143; _L. and\r\n                   P._, i., 4511, 4560.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 150: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 132.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 151: _Ibid._, ii., 159.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 152: _Ibid._, ii., 158, 163.]\r\n\r\nThat design had occupied him throughout the summer, before Louis had\r\nbecome so amenable; then he was urging Maximilian that the Pope must\r\nbe kept on their side and persuaded \"not to forgive the great sins\r\ncommitted by the King of France\"; for if he removed his ecclesiastical\r\ncensures, Ferdinand and Maximilian \"would be deprived of a plausible\r\nexcuse for confiscating the territories they intended to conquer\".[153]\r\nProvidence was, as usual, to be bribed into assisting in the       (p. 071)\r\nrobbery of Venice by a promise to make war on the Turk. But now that\r\nLouis was prepared to give his daughter Renee in marriage to young\r\nFerdinand and to endow the couple with Milan and Genoa and his claims\r\non Naples, his sins might be forgiven. The two monarchs would not be\r\njustified in making war upon France in face of these offers. Venice\r\nremained a difficulty, for Louis was not likely to help to despoil his\r\nfaithful ally; but Ferdinand had a suggestion. They could all make\r\npeace publicly guaranteeing the Republic's possessions, but Maximilian\r\nand he could make a \"mental reservation\" enabling them to partition\r\nVenice, when France could no longer prevent it.[154]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 153: _Ibid._, ii., 131.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 154: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 153.]\r\n\r\nSo on 13th March, 1514, Ferdinand renewed his truce with France, and\r\nMaximilian joined it soon after.[155] The old excuses about the\r\nreformation of the Church, his death-bed desire to make peace with his\r\nenemies, could scarcely be used again; so Ferdinand instructed his\r\nagent to say, if Henry asked for an explanation, that there was a\r\nsecret conspiracy in Italy.[156] If he had said no more, it would have\r\nbeen literally true, for the conspiracy was his own; but he went on to\r\nrelate that the conspiracy was being hatched by the Italians to drive\r\nhim and the Emperor out of the peninsula. The two were alike in their\r\ntreachery; both secretly entered the truce with France and broke their\r\npromise to Henry. Another engagement of longer standing was ruptured.\r\nSince 1508, Henry's sister Mary had been betrothed to Maximilian's\r\ngrandson Charles. The marriage was to take place when Charles was  (p. 072)\r\nfourteen; the pledge had been renewed at Lille, and the nuptials fixed\r\nnot later than 15th May, 1514.[157] Charles wrote to Mary signing\r\nhimself _votre mari_, while Mary was styled Princess of Castile,\r\ncarried about a bad portrait of Charles,[158] and diplomatically\r\nsighed for his presence ten times a day. But winter wore on and turned\r\nto spring; no sign was forthcoming of Maximilian's intention to keep\r\nhis grandson's engagement, and Charles was reported as having said\r\nthat he wanted a wife and not a mother.[159] All Henry's inquiries\r\nwere met by excuses; the Ides of May came and went, but they brought\r\nno wedding between Mary and Charles.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 155: _Ibid._, ii., 164; _Ven. Cal._, ii.,\r\n                   389, 391, 401, 405.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 156: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 167.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 157: _L. and P._, i., 4560.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 158: _Ibid._, i., 5203.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 159: _Ven. Cal_., ii., 295. Charles was\r\n                   fourteen, Mary eighteen years of age.]\r\n\r\nHenry was learning by bitter experience. Not only was he left to face\r\nsingle-handed the might of Louis; but Ferdinand and Maximilian had\r\nsecretly bound themselves to make war on him, if he carried out the\r\ntreaty to which they had all three publicly agreed. The man whom he\r\nsaid he loved as a natural father, and the titular sovereign of\r\nChristendom, had combined to cheat the boy-king who had come to the\r\nthrone with youthful enthusiasms and natural, generous instincts. \"Nor\r\ndo I see,\" said Henry to Giustinian, \"any faith in the world save in\r\nme, and therefore God Almighty, who knows this, prospers my affairs.\"[160]\r\nThis absorbing belief in himself and his righteousness led to strange\r\naberrations in later years, but in 1514 it had some justification. \"Je\r\nvous assure,\" wrote Margaret of Savoy to her father, the Emperor,  (p. 073)\r\n\"qu'en lui n'a nulle faintise.\" \"At any rate,\" said Pasqualigo, \"King\r\nHenry has done himself great honour, and kept faith single-handed.\"[161]\r\nA more striking testimony was forthcoming a year or two later. When\r\nCharles succeeded Ferdinand, the Bishop of Badajos drew up for\r\nCardinal Ximenes a report on the state of the Prince's affairs. In it\r\nhe says: \"The King of England has been truer to his engagements\r\ntowards the House of Austria than any other prince. The marriage of\r\nthe Prince with the Princess Mary, it must be confessed, did not take\r\nplace, but it may be questioned whether it was the fault of the King\r\nof England or of the Prince and his advisers. However that may be,\r\nwith the exception of the marriage, the King of England has generally\r\nfulfilled his obligations towards the Prince, and has behaved as a\r\ntrusty friend. An alliance with the English can be trusted most of\r\nall.\"[162]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 160: _L. and P._, ii., 3163.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 161: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 406.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 162: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 246.]\r\n\r\nBut the meekest and saintliest monarch could scarce pass unscathed\r\nthrough the baptism of fraud practised on Henry; and Henry was at no\r\ntime saintly or meek. Ferdinand, he complained, induced him to enter\r\nupon the war, and urged the Pope to use his influence with him for\r\nthat purpose; he had been at great expense, had assisted Maximilian,\r\ntaken Tournay, and reduced France to extremities; and now, when his\r\nenemy was at his feet, Ferdinand talked of truce: he would never trust\r\nany one again.[163] \"Had the King of Spain,\" wrote a Venetian attache,\r\n\"kept his promise to the King of England, the latter would never have\r\nmade peace with France; and the promises of the Emperor were equally\r\nfalse, for he had received many thousands of pounds from King      (p. 074)\r\nHenry, on condition that he was to be in person at Calais in the month\r\nof May, with a considerable force in the King's pay; but the Emperor\r\npocketed the money and never came. His failure was the cause of all\r\nthat took place, for, as King Henry was deceived in every direction,\r\nhe thought fit to take this other course.\"[164] He discovered that he,\r\ntoo, could play at the game of making peace behind the backs of his\r\nnominal friends; and when once he had made up his mind, he played the\r\ngame with vastly more effect than Maximilian or Ferdinand. It was he\r\nwho had been really formidable to Louis, and Louis was therefore\r\nprepared to pay him a higher price than to either of the others. In\r\nFebruary Henry had got wind of his allies' practices with France. In\r\nthe same month a nuncio started from Rome to mediate peace between\r\nHenry and Louis;[165] but, before his arrival, informal advances had\r\nprobably been made through the Duc de Longueville, a prisoner in\r\nEngland since the Battle of Spurs.[166] In January Louis' wife, Anne\r\nof Brittany, had died. Louis was fifty-two years old, worn out and\r\ndecrepit; but at least half a dozen brides were proposed for his hand.\r\nIn March it was rumoured in Rome that he would choose Henry's sister\r\nMary, the rejected of Charles.[167] But Henry waited till May had\r\npassed, and Maximilian had proclaimed to the world his breach of\r\npromise. Negotiations for the alliance and marriage with Louis then\r\nproceeded apace. Treaties for both were signed in August. Tournay\r\nremained in Henry's hands, Louis increased the pensions paid by\r\nFrance to England since the Treaty of Etaples, and both kings      (p. 075)\r\nbound themselves to render mutual aid against their common\r\nfoes.[168]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 163: _L. and P._, i., 4864.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 164: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 505.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 165: _Ibid._, ii., 372.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 166: _Ibid._, ii., 505; _L. and P._, i.,\r\n                   5173, 5278.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 167: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 383.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 168: _L. and P._, i., 5305; _Ven. Cal._,\r\n                   ii., 482, 483.]\r\n\r\nMaximilian and Ferdinand were left out in the cold. Louis not only\r\nbroke off his negotiations with them, but prepared to regain Milan and\r\ndiscussed with Henry the revival of his father's schemes for the\r\nconquest of Castile. Henry was to claim part of that kingdom in right\r\nof his wife, the late Queen's daughter; later on a still more shadowy\r\ntitle by descent was suggested. As early as 5th October, the Venetian\r\nGovernment wrote to its ambassador in France, \"commending extremely\r\nthe most sage proceeding of Louis in exhorting the King of England to\r\nattack Castile\".[169] Towards the end of the year it declared that\r\nLouis had wished to attack Spain, and sought to arrange details in an\r\ninterview with Henry; but the English King would not consent, delayed\r\nthe interview, and refused the six thousand infantry required for the\r\npurpose.[170] But Henry had certainly urged Louis to reconquer\r\nNavarre,[171] and from the tenor of Louis' reply to Henry, late in\r\nNovember, it would be inferred that the proposed conquest of Castile\r\nalso emanated from the English King or his ministers. Louis professed\r\nnot to know the laws of succession in Spain, but he was willing to\r\njoin the attack, apart from the merits of the case on which it was\r\nbased. Whether the suggestion originated in France or in England,\r\nwhether Henry eventually refused it or not, its serious discussion\r\nshows how far Henry had travelled in his resentment at the double\r\ndealing of Ferdinand. Carroz complained that he was treated by     (p. 076)\r\nthe English \"like a bull at whom every one throws darts,\"[172] and\r\nthat Henry himself behaved in a most offensive manner whenever\r\nFerdinand's name was mentioned. \"If,\" he added, \"Ferdinand did not put\r\na bridle on this young colt,\" it would afterwards become impossible to\r\ncontrol him. The young colt was, indeed, already meditating a project,\r\nto attain which he, in later years, took the bit in his teeth and\r\nbroke loose from control. He was not only betrayed into casting in\r\nCatherine's teeth her father's ill faith, but threatening her with\r\ndivorce.[173]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 169: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 495.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 170: _Ibid._, ii., 532, 542.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 171: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 192; _L. and P._,\r\n                   i., 5637.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 172: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 201. A Venetian\r\n                   reports that the English were so enraged that they\r\n                   would have killed Carroz had it not been for Henry\r\n                   (_Ven. Cal._, ii., 248), and Carroz was actually\r\n                   placed in confinement.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 173: _L. and P._, i., 5718; _Ven. Cal._,\r\n                   ii., 464.]\r\n\r\nHenry had struck back with a vengeance. His blow shivered to fragments\r\nthe airy castles which Maximilian and Ferdinand were busy constructing.\r\nTheir plans for reviving the empire of Charlemagne, creating a new\r\nkingdom in Italy, inducing Louis to cede Milan and Genoa and assist in\r\nthe conquest of Venice, disappeared like empty dreams. The younger\r\nFerdinand found no provision in Italy; he was compelled to retain his\r\nAustrian inheritance, and thus to impair the power of the future\r\nCharles V.; while the children's grandparents were left sadly\r\nreflecting on means of defence against the Kings of England and\r\nFrance. The blot on the triumph was Henry's desertion of Sforza,[174]\r\nwho, having gratefully acknowledged that to Henry he owed his\r\nrestoration of Milan,[175] was now left to the uncovenanted mercies\r\nof Louis. But neither the credit nor discredit is due mainly to    (p. 077)\r\nHenry. He had learnt much, but his powers were not yet developed\r\nenough to make him a match for the craft and guile of his rivals. The\r\nconsciousness of the fact made him rely more and more upon Wolsey, who\r\ncould easily beat both Maximilian and Ferdinand at their own game. He\r\nwas not more deceitful than they, but in grasp of detail, in boldness\r\nand assiduity, he was vastly superior. While Ferdinand hawked, and\r\nMaximilian hunted the chamois, Wolsey worked often for twelve hours\r\ntogether at the cares of the State. Possibly, too, his clerical\r\nprofession and the cardinalate which he was soon to hold gave him an\r\nadvantage which they did not possess; for, whenever he wanted to obtain\r\ncredence for a more than usually monstrous perversion of truth, he\r\nswore \"as became a cardinal and on the honour of the cardinalate\".[176]\r\nHis services were richly rewarded; besides livings, prebends,\r\ndeaneries and the Chancellorship of Cambridge University, he received\r\nthe Bishoprics of Lincoln and of Tournay, the Archbishopric of York,\r\nand finally, in 1515, Cardinalate. This dignity he had already, in May\r\nof the previous year, sent Polydore Vergil to claim from the Pope;\r\nVergil's mission was unknown to Henry, to whom the grant of the\r\nCardinal's hat was to be represented as Leo's own idea.[177]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 174: _L. and P._, i., 5319.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 175: _Ibid._, i., 4499, 4921.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 176: _Cf._ _Ven.

Giustinian complains that Wolsey\r\n                   \"never said what he meant but the reverse of what\r\n                   he intended to do\" (_Ibid._, ii., 3081). This\r\n                   perhaps is no great crime in a diplomatist.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 177: _L. and P._, i., 5110, 5121.

(p. 078)\r\n\r\nTHE THREE RIVALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe edifice which Wolsey had so laboriously built up was, however,\r\nbased on no surer foundation than the feeble life of a sickly monarch\r\nalready tottering to his grave. In the midst of his preparations for\r\nthe conquest of Milan and his negotiations for an attack upon Spain,\r\nLouis XII. died on 1st January, 1515; and the stone which Wolsey had\r\nbarely rolled up the hill came down with a rush. The bourgeois Louis\r\nwas succeeded by the brilliant, ambitious and warlike Francis I., a\r\nmonarch who concealed under the mask of chivalry and the culture of\r\narts and letters a libertinism beside which the peccadilloes of Henry\r\nor Charles seem virtue itself; whose person was tall and whose\r\nfeatures were described as handsome; but of whom an observer wrote\r\nwith unwonted candour that he \"looked like the Devil\".[178] The first\r\nresult of the change was an episode of genuine romance. The old King's\r\nwidow, \"la reine blanche,\" was one of the most fascinating women of\r\nthe Tudor epoch. \"I think,\" said a Fleming, \"never man saw a more\r\nbeautiful creature, nor one having so much grace and sweetness.\"[179]\r\n\"He had never seen so beautiful a lady,\" repeated Maximilian's\r\nambassador, \"her deportment is exquisite, both in conversation     (p. 079)\r\nand in dancing, and she is very lovely.\"[180] \"She is very beautiful,\"\r\nechoed the staid old Venetian, Pasqualigo, \"and has not her match in\r\nEngland; she is tall, fair, of a light complexion with a colour, and\r\nmost affable and graceful\"; he was warranted, he said, in describing\r\nher as \"a nymph from heaven\".[181] A more critical observer of\r\nfeminine beauty thought her eyes and eyebrows too light,[182] but, as\r\nan Italian, he may have been biassed in favour of brunettes, and even\r\nhe wound up by calling Mary \"a Paradise\". She was eighteen at the\r\ntime; her marriage with a dotard like Louis had shocked public\r\nopinion;[183] and if, as was hinted, the gaieties in which his\r\nyouthful bride involved him, hastened the French King's end, there was\r\nsome poetic justice in the retribution. She had, as she reminded Henry\r\nherself, only consented to marry the \"very aged and sickly\" monarch on\r\ncondition that, if she survived him, she should be allowed to choose\r\nher second husband herself. And she went on to declare, that\r\n\"remembering the great virtue\" in him, she had, as Henry himself was\r\naware, \"always been of good mind to my Lord of Suffolk\".[184]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 178: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 582.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 179: _L. and P._, i., 4953.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 180: _L. and P._, i., 5203.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 181: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 499, 500.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 182: _Ibid._, ii., 511.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 183: _L. and P._, i., 5470.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 184: _Ibid._, ii., 227.]\r\n\r\nShe was probably fascinated less by Suffolk's virtue than by his bold\r\nand handsome bearing. A bluff Englishman after the King's own heart,\r\nhe shared, as none else did, in Henry's love of the joust and tourney,\r\nin his skill with the lance and the sword; he was the Hector of\r\ncombat, on foot and on horse, to Henry's Achilles. His father, plain\r\nWilliam Brandon, was Henry of Richmond's standard-bearer on Bosworth\r\nfield; and as such he had been singled out and killed in personal  (p. 080)\r\nencounter by Richard III. His death gave his son a claim on the\r\ngratitude of Henry VII. and Henry VIII.; and similarity of tastes\r\nsecured him rapid promotion at the young King's Court. Created Viscount\r\nLisle, he served in 1513 as marshal of Henry's army throughout his\r\ncampaign in France. With the King there were said to be \"two obstinate\r\nmen who governed everything\";[185] one was Wolsey, the other was Brandon.\r\nIn July he was offering his hand to Margaret of Savoy, who was\r\ninformed that Brandon was \"a second king,\" and that it would be well\r\nto write him \"a kind letter, for it is he who does and undoes\".[186]\r\nAt Lille, in October, he continued his assault on Margaret as a relief\r\nfrom the siege of Tournay; Henry favoured his suit, and when Margaret\r\ncalled Brandon a _larron_ for stealing a ring from her finger, the\r\nKing was called in to help Brandon out with his French. Possibly it\r\nwas to smooth the course of his wooing that Brandon, early in 1514,\r\nreceived an extraordinary advancement in rank. There was as yet only\r\none duke in England, but now Brandon was made Duke of Suffolk, at the\r\nsame time that the dukedom of Norfolk was restored to Surrey for his\r\nvictory at Flodden. Even a dukedom could barely make the son of a\r\nsimple esquire a match for an emperor's daughter, and the suit did not\r\nprosper. Political reasons may have interfered. Suffolk, too, is\r\naccused by the Venetian ambassador of having already had three\r\nwives.[187] This seems to be an exaggeration, but the intricacy    (p. 081)\r\nof the Duke's marital relationships, and the facility with which he\r\nrenounced them might well have served as a precedent to his master in\r\nlater years.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 185: _L. and P._, i., 4386.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 186: _Ibid._, i., 4405.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 187: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 464. He had made\r\n                   contracts with three different ladies, but had not\r\n                   actually married them all. See below, p. 199 and\r\n                   _D.N.B._, _s.v._ \"Brandon\".]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1515, the Duke was sent to Paris to condole with Francis\r\non Louis' death, to congratulate him on his own accession, and renew\r\nthe league with England. Before he set out, Henry made him promise\r\nthat he would not marry Mary until their return. But Suffolk was not\r\nthe man to resist the tears of a beautiful woman in trouble, and he\r\nfound Mary in sore distress. No sooner was Louis dead than his\r\nlascivious successor became, as Mary said, \"importunate with her in\r\ndivers matters not to her honour,\" in suits \"the which,\" wrote Suffolk,\r\n\"I and the Queen had rather be out of the world than abide\".[188]\r\nEvery evening Francis forced his attentions upon the beautiful\r\nwidow.[189] Nor was this the only trouble which threatened the lovers.\r\nThere were reports that the French would not let Mary go, but marry\r\nher somewhere to serve their own political purposes.[190] Henry, too,\r\nmight want to betroth her again to Charles; Maximilian was urging this\r\ncourse, and telling Margaret that Mary must be recovered for Charles,\r\neven at the point of the sword.[191] Early in January, Wolsey had\r\nwritten to her, warning her not to make any fresh promise of marriage.\r\nTwo friars from England, sent apparently by Suffolk's secret enemies,\r\ntold Mary the same tale, that if she returned to England she would\r\nnever be suffered to marry the Duke, but made to take Charles for her\r\nhusband, \"than which,\" she declared, \"I would rather be torn in    (p. 082)\r\npieces\".[192] Suffolk tried in vain to soothe her fears. She refused\r\nto listen, and brought him to his knees with the announcement that\r\nunless he would wed her there and then, she would continue to believe\r\nthat he had come only to entice her back to England and force her into\r\nmarriage with Charles. What was the poor Duke to do, between his\r\npromise to Henry and the pleading of Mary? He did what every other man\r\nwith a heart in his breast and warm blood in his veins would have\r\ndone, he cast prudence to the winds and secretly married the woman he\r\nloved.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 188: _L. and P._, ii., 134, 138, 163.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 189: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 574.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 190: _L. and P._, ii., 70, 85, 114.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 191: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 594; _L. and P._,\r\n                   ii., 124.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 192: _L. and P._, ii., 80, Suffolk to\r\n                   Henry VIII. This letter is placed under January in\r\n                   the _Calendar_, but it was obviously written about\r\n                   6th March, 1514-15.]\r\n\r\nThe news could not be long concealed, but unfortunately we have only\r\nWolsey's account of how it was received by Henry. He took it, wrote\r\nthe cardinal to Suffolk, \"grievously and displeasantly,\" not only on\r\naccount of the Duke's presumption, but of the breach of his promise to\r\nHenry.[193] \"You are,\" he added, \"in the greatest danger man was ever\r\nin;\" the council were calling for his ruin. To appease Henry and\r\nenable the King to satisfy his council, Suffolk must induce Francis to\r\nintervene in his favour, to pay Henry two hundred thousand crowns as\r\nMary's dowry, and to restore the plate and jewels she had received;\r\nthe Duke himself was to return the fortune with which Henry had endowed\r\nhis sister and pay twenty-four thousand pounds in yearly instalments\r\nfor the expenses of her marriage. Francis proved unexpectedly willing;\r\nperhaps his better nature was touched by the lovers' distress. He also\r\nsaw that Mary's marriage with Suffolk prevented her being used as  (p. 083)\r\na link to bind Charles to Henry; and he may have thought that a\r\nservice to Suffolk would secure him a powerful friend at the English\r\nCourt, a calculation that was partly justified by the suspicion under\r\nwhich Suffolk henceforth laboured, of being too partial to Francis.\r\nYet it was with heavy hearts that the couple left Paris in April and\r\nwended their way towards Calais. Henry had given no sign; from Calais,\r\nMary wrote to him saying she would go to a nunnery rather than marry\r\nagainst her desire.[194] Suffolk threw himself on the King's mercy;\r\nall the council, he said, except Wolsey, were determined to put him to\r\ndeath.[195] Secretly, against his promise, and without Henry's\r\nconsent, he had married the King's sister, an act the temerity of\r\nwhich no one has since ventured to rival. He saw the executioner's axe\r\ngleam before his eyes, and he trembled.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 193: _L. and P._, ii., 224.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 194: _L. and P._, ii., 228.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 195: _Ibid._, ii., 367.]\r\n\r\nAt Calais, Mary said she would stay until she heard from the King.[196]\r\nHis message has not been preserved, but fears were never more strangely\r\nbelied than when the pair crossed their Rubicon. So far from any attempt\r\nbeing made to separate them, their marriage was publicly solemnised\r\nbefore Henry and all his Court on 13th May, at Greenwich.[197] In\r\nspite of all that happened, wrote the Venetian ambassador, Henry\r\nretained his friendship for Suffolk;[198] and a few months later he\r\nasserted, with some exaggeration, that the Duke's authority was\r\nscarcely less than the King's.[199] He and Mary were indeed        (p. 084)\r\nrequired to return all the endowment, whether in money, plate, jewels\r\nor furniture, that she received on her marriage. But both she and the\r\nDuke had agreed to these terms before their offence.[200] They were\r\nnot unreasonable. Henry's money had been laid out for political\r\npurposes which could no longer be served; and Mary did not expect the\r\nsplendour, as Duchess of Suffolk, which she had enjoyed as Queen of\r\nFrance. The only stipulation that looks like a punishment was the bond\r\nto repay the cost of her journey to France; though not only was this\r\nmodified later on, but the Duke received numerous grants of land to\r\nhelp to defray the charge. They were indeed required to live in the\r\ncountry; but the Duke still came up to joust as of old with Henry on\r\ngreat occasions, and Mary remained his favourite sister, to whose\r\nissue, in preference to that of Margaret, he left the crown by will.\r\nThe vindictive suspicions which afterwards grew to rank luxuriance in\r\nHenry's mind were scarcely budding as yet; his favour to Suffolk and\r\naffection for Mary were proof against the intrigues in his Court. The\r\ncontrast was marked between the event and the terrors which Wolsey had\r\npainted; and it is hard to believe that the Cardinal played an\r\nentirely disinterested part in the matter.[201] It was obviously his\r\ncue to exaggerate the King's anger, and to represent to the Duke that\r\nits mitigation was due to the Cardinal's influence; and it is more\r\nthan possible that Wolsey found in Suffolk's indiscretion the means of\r\nremoving a dangerous rival. The \"two obstinate men\" who had ruled  (p. 085)\r\nin Henry's camp were not likely to remain long united; Wolsey could\r\nhardly approve of any \"second king\" but himself, especially a \"second\r\nking\" who had acquired a family bond with the first. The Venetian\r\nambassador plainly hints that it was through Wolsey that Suffolk lost\r\nfavour.[202] In the occasional notices of him during the next few\r\nyears it is Wolsey, and not Henry, whom Suffolk is trying to appease;\r\nand we even find the Cardinal secretly warning the King against some\r\ndesigns of the Duke that probably existed only in his own\r\nimagination.[203]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 196: _Ibid._, ii., 367, 226. The letters\r\n                   relating to this episode in _L. and P._ are often\r\n                   undated and sometimes misplaced; _e.g._, this last\r\n                   is placed under March, although from Nos. 295, 296,\r\n                   319, 327, 331, we find that Mary did not leave\r\n                   Paris till 16th April.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 197: _L. and P._, ii., 468.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 198: _Ven.

It was to renew the treaty concluded the year\r\nbefore, and apparently also the discussions for war upon Spain.\r\nFrancis was ready enough to confirm the treaty, particularly as it\r\nleft him free to pursue his designs on Milan. With a similar object he\r\nmade terms with the Archduke Charles, who this year assumed the\r\ngovernment of the Netherlands, but was completely under the control of\r\nChievres, a Frenchman by birth and sympathy, who signed his letters to\r\nFrancis \"your humble servant and vassal\".[204] Charles bound himself\r\nto marry Louis XII.'s daughter Renee, and to give his grandfather\r\nFerdinand no aid unless he restored Navarre to Jean d'Albret. Thus\r\nsafeguarded from attack on his rear, Francis set out for Milan. The\r\nSwiss had locked all the passes they thought practicable; but the\r\nFrench generals, guided by chamois hunters and overcoming almost\r\ninsuperable obstacles, transported their artillery over the Alps   (p. 086)\r\nnear Embrun; and on 13th September, at Marignano, the great \"Battle of\r\nthe Giants\" laid the whole of Northern Italy at the French King's\r\nfeet. At Bologna he met Leo X., whose lifelong endeavour was to be\r\nfound on both sides at once, or at least on the side of the bigger\r\nbattalions; the Pope recognised Francis's claim to Milan, while\r\nFrancis undertook to support the Medici in Florence, and to\r\ncountenance Leo's project for securing the Duchy of Urbino to his\r\nnephew Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 204: _Sp. Cal_., ii., 246.]\r\n\r\nHenry watched with ill-concealed jealousy his rival's victorious\r\nprogress; his envy was personal, as well as political. \"Francis,\"\r\nwrote the Bishop of Worcester in describing the interview between the\r\nFrench King and the Pope at Bologna, \"is tall in stature,\r\nbroad-shouldered, oval and handsome in face, very slender in the legs\r\nand much inclined to corpulence.\"[205] His appearance was the subject\r\nof critical inquiry by Henry himself. On May Day, 1515, Pasqualigo[206]\r\nwas summoned to Greenwich by the King, whom he found dressed in green,\r\n\"shoes and all,\" and mounted on a bay Frieslander sent him by the\r\nMarquis of Mantua; his guard were also dressed in green and armed with\r\nbows and arrows for the usual May Day sports. They breakfasted in\r\ngreen bowers some distance from the palace. \"His Majesty,\" continues\r\nPasqualigo, \"came into our arbor, and addressing me in French, said:\r\n'Talk with me awhile. The King of France, is he as tall as I am?' I\r\ntold him there was but little difference. He continued, 'Is he as\r\nstout?' I said he was not; and he then inquired, 'What sort of legs\r\nhas he?' I replied 'Spare'. Whereupon he opened the front of his   (p. 087)\r\ndoublet, and placing his hand on his thigh, said: 'Look here; and\r\nI also have a good calf to my leg'. He then told me he was very fond\r\nof this King of France, and that on more than three occasions he was\r\nvery near him with his army, but that he would never allow himself to\r\nbe seen, and always retreated, which His Majesty attributed to\r\ndeference for King Louis, who did not choose an engagement to take\r\nplace.\" After dinner, by way of showing his prowess, Henry \"armed\r\nhimself _cap-a-pie_ and ran thirty courses, capsizing his opponent,\r\nhorse and all\". Two months later, he said to Giustinian: \"I am aware\r\nthat King Louis, although my brother-in-law, was a bad man. I know not\r\nwhat this youth may be; he is, however, a Frenchman, nor can I say how\r\nfar you should trust him;\"[207] and Giustinian says he at once\r\nperceived the great rivalry for glory between the two young kings.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 205: _L. and P._, ii., 1281.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 206: _Ibid._, ii., 411; Giustinian,\r\n                   _Desp._, i., 90; _Ven. Cal._, ii., 624.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 207: _Ven. Cal_., ii., 652]\r\n\r\nHenry now complained that Francis had concealed his Italian enterprise\r\nfrom him, that he was ill-treating English subjects, and interfering\r\nwith matters in Scotland. The last was his real and chief ground for\r\nresentment. Francis had no great belief that Henry would keep the\r\npeace, and resist the temptation to attack him, if a suitable\r\nopportunity were to arise. So he had sent the Duke of Albany to\r\nprovide Henry with an absorbing disturbance in Scotland. Since the\r\ndeath of James IV. at Flodden, English influence had, in Margaret's\r\nhands, been largely increased. Henry took upon himself to demand a\r\nvoice in Scotland's internal affairs. He claimed the title of\r\n\"Protector of Scotland\"; and wrote to the Pope asking him to       (p. 088)\r\nappoint no Scottish bishops without his consent, and to reduce the\r\nArchbishopric of St. Andrews to its ancient dependence on York.[208]\r\nMany urged him to complete the conquest of Scotland, but this\r\napparently he refused on the ground that his own sister was really its\r\nruler and his own infant nephew its king. Margaret, however, as an\r\nEnglishwoman, was hated in Scotland, and she destroyed much of her\r\ninfluence by marrying the Earl of Angus. So the Scots clamoured for\r\nAlbany, who had long been resident at the French Court and was heir to\r\nthe Scottish throne, should James IV.'s issue fail. His appearance was\r\nthe utter discomfiture of the party of England; Margaret was besieged\r\nin Stirling and ultimately forced to give up her children to Albany's\r\nkeeping, and seek safety in flight to her brother's dominions.[209]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 208: _L. and P._, i., 4483, 4502; ii.,\r\n                   654.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 209: It was said by the Scots Estates\r\n                   that she had forfeited her claim to their custody\r\n                   by her marriage with Angus (_ibid._, ii., 1011).]\r\n\r\nTechnically, Francis had not broken his treaty with England, but he\r\nhad scarcely acted the part of a friend; and if Henry could retaliate\r\nwithout breaking the peace, he would eagerly seize any opportunity\r\nthat offered. The alliance with Ferdinand and Maximilian was renewed,\r\nand a new Holy League formed under Leo's auspices. But Leo soon\r\nafterwards made his peace at Bologna with France. Charles was under\r\nFrench influence, and Henry's council and people were not prepared for\r\nwar. So he refused, says Giustinian, Ferdinand's invitations to join\r\nin an invasion of France. He did so from no love of Francis, and it\r\nwas probably Wolsey's ingenuity which suggested the not very scrupulous\r\nmeans of gratifying Henry's wish for revenge. Maximilian was       (p. 089)\r\nstill pursuing his endless quarrel with Venice; and the seizure of\r\nMilan by the French and Venetian allies was a severe blow to\r\nMaximilian himself, to the Swiss, and to their protege, Sforza. Wolsey\r\nnow sought to animate them all for an attempt to recover the duchy,\r\nand Sforza promised him 10,000 ducats a year from the date of his\r\nrestoration. There was nothing but the spirit of his treaty with\r\nFrance to prevent Henry spending his money as he thought fit; and it\r\nwas determined to hire 20,000 Swiss mercenaries to serve under the\r\nEmperor in order to conquer Milan and revenge Marignano.[210] The\r\nnegotiation was one of great delicacy; not only was secrecy absolutely\r\nessential, but the money must be carefully kept out of Maximilian's\r\nreach. \"Whenever,\" wrote Pace, \"the King's money passed where the\r\nEmperor was, he would always get some portion of it by force or false\r\npromises of restitution.\"[211] The accusation was justified by\r\nMaximilian's order to Margaret, his daughter, to seize Henry's\r\ntreasure as soon as he heard it was on the way to the Swiss.[212] \"The\r\nEmperor,\" said Julius II., \"is light and inconstant, always begging\r\nfor other men's money, which he wastes in hunting the chamois.\"[213]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 210: _L. and P._, ii., 1065.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 211: _Ibid._, ii., 1817.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 212: _Ibid._, ii., 1231.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 213: _Ibid._, ii., 1877.]\r\n\r\nThe envoy selected for this difficult mission was Richard Pace,\r\nscholar and author, and friend of Erasmus and More. He had been in\r\nBainbridge's service at Rome, was then transferred to that of Wolsey\r\nand Henry, and as the King's secretary, was afterwards thought to be\r\ntreading too close on the Cardinal's heels. He set out in October, and\r\narrived in Zurich just in time to prevent the Swiss from coming    (p. 090)\r\nto terms with Francis. Before winter had ended the plans for invasion\r\nwere settled. Maximilian came down with the snows from the mountains\r\nin March; on the 23rd he crossed the Adda;[214] on the 25th he was\r\nwithin nine miles of Milan, and almost in sight of the army of France.\r\nOn the 26th he turned and fled without striking a blow. Back he went\r\nover the Adda, over the Oglio, up into Tyrol, leaving the French and\r\nVenetians in secure possession of Northern Italy. A year later they\r\nhad recovered for Venice the last of the places of which it had been\r\nrobbed by the League of Cambrai.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 214: _L. and P._, ii., 1697, 1699, 1721,\r\n                   1729, 1736, 1754, 1831, 2011, 2034, 2114.]\r\n\r\nMaximilian retreated, said Pace, voluntarily and shamefully, and was\r\nnow so degraded that it signified little whether he was a friend or an\r\nenemy.[215] The cause of his ignominious flight still remains a\r\nmystery; countless excuses were made by Maximilian and his friends. He\r\nhad heard that France and England had come to terms; 6,000 of the\r\nSwiss infantry deserted to the French on the eve of the battle.\r\nLadislaus of Hungary had died, leaving him guardian of his son, and he\r\nmust go to arrange matters there. He had no money to pay his troops.\r\nThe last has an appearance of verisimilitude. Money was at the bottom\r\nof all his difficulties, and drove him to the most ignominious shifts.\r\nHe had served as a private in Henry's army for 100 crowns a day. His\r\ncouncillors robbed him; on one occasion he had not money to pay for\r\nhis dinner;[216] on another he sent down to Pace, who was ill in bed,\r\nand extorted a loan by force. He had apparently seized 30,000      (p. 091)\r\ncrowns of Henry's pay for the Swiss;[217] the Fuggers, Welzers and\r\nFrescobaldi, were also accused of failing to keep their engagements,\r\nand only the first month's pay had been received by the Swiss when\r\nthey reached Milan. On the Emperor's retreat the wretched Pace was\r\nseized by the Swiss and kept in prison as security for the remainder.[218]\r\nHis task had been rendered all the more difficult by the folly of\r\nWingfield, ambassador at Maximilian's Court, who, said Pace, \"took the\r\nEmperor for a god and believed that all his deeds and thoughts\r\nproceeded _ex Spiritu Sancto_\".[219] There was no love lost between\r\nthem; the lively Pace nicknamed his colleague \"Summer shall be green,\"\r\nin illusion perhaps to Wingfield's unending platitudes, or to his\r\nlimitless belief in the Emperor's integrity and wisdom.[220] Wingfield\r\nopened Pace's letters and discovered the gibe, which he parried by\r\navowing that he had never known the time when summer was not\r\ngreen.[221] On another occasion he forged Pace's signature, with a\r\nview of obtaining funds for Maximilian;[222] and he had the hardihood\r\nto protest against Pace's appointment as Henry's secretary. At last\r\nhis conduct brought down a stinging rebuke from Henry;[223] but the\r\nKing's long-suffering was not yet exhausted, and Wingfield continued\r\nas ambassador to the Emperors Court.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 215: _Ibid._, ii., 1877.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 216: _Ibid._, ii., 2152, 1892, 1896,\r\n                   2034, 2035.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 217: _L. and P._, ii., 1231, 1792, 1854.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 218: _Ibid._, ii., 1877.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 219: _Ibid._, ii., 1817.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 220: _Ibid._, ii., 1566, 1567.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 221: _Ibid._, ii., 1775.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 222: _Ibid._, ii., 1813.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 223: _Ibid._, ii., 2177.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Milan expedition taught Wolsey and Henry a bitter\r\nbut salutary lesson. It was their first attempt to intervene in a\r\nsphere of action so distant from English shores and so remote      (p. 092)\r\nfrom English interests as the affairs of Italian States. Complaints in\r\nEngland were loud against the waste of money; the sagacious Tunstall\r\nwrote that he did not see why Henry should bind himself to maintain\r\nother men's causes.[224] All the grandees, wrote Giustinian, were\r\nopposed to Wolsey's policy, and its adoption was followed by what\r\nGiustinian called a change of ministry in England.[225] Warham\r\nrelinquished the burdens of the Chancellorship which he had long\r\nunwillingly borne; Fox sought to atone for twenty-eight years' neglect\r\nof his diocese by spending in it the rest of his days.[226] Wolsey\r\nsucceeded Warham as Chancellor, and Ruthal, who \"sang treble to\r\nWolsey's bass,\"[227] became Lord Privy Seal in place of Fox. Suffolk\r\nwas out of favour, and the neglect of his and Fox's advice was,\r\naccording to the Venetian, resented by the people, who murmured\r\nagainst the taxes which Wolsey's intervention in foreign affairs\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 224: _L. and P._, ii., 2270.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 225: _Ibid._, ii., 1814, 2487, 2500.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 226: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 750, 798, 801; _L.\r\n                   and P._, ii., 2183.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 227: _L. and P._, ii., 2205.]\r\n\r\nBut Wolsey still hoped that bribes would keep Maximilian faithful to\r\nEngland and induce him to counteract the French influences with which\r\nhis grandson Charles was surrounded. Ferdinand had died in January,\r\n1516,[228] having, said the English envoy at his Court, wilfully\r\nshortened his life by hunting and hawking in all weathers, and following\r\nthe advice of his falconers rather than that of his physicians.\r\nCharles thus succeeded to Castile, Aragon and Naples;[229] but     (p. 093)\r\nNaples was seriously threatened by the failure of Maximilian's\r\nexpedition and the omnipotence of Francis in Italy. \"The Pope is\r\nFrench,\" wrote an English diplomatist, \"and everything from Rome to\r\nCalais.\"[230] To save Naples, Charles, in July, 1516, entered into the\r\nhumiliating Treaty of Noyon with France.[231] He bound himself to\r\nmarry Francis's infant daughter, Charlotte, to do justice to Jean\r\nd'Albret in the matter of Navarre, and to surrender Naples, Navarre,\r\nand Artois, if he failed to keep his engagement. Such a treaty was not\r\nlikely to stand; but, for the time, it was a great feather in\r\nFrancis's cap, and a further step towards the isolation of England. It\r\nwas the work of Charles's Gallicised ministry, and Maximilian\r\nprofessed the utmost disgust at their doings. He was eager to come\r\ndown to the Netherlands with a view to breaking the Treaty of Noyon\r\nand removing his grandson's advisers, but of course he must have money\r\nfrom England to pay his expenses. The money accordingly came from the\r\napparently bottomless English purse;[232] and in January, 1517, the\r\nEmperor marched down to the Netherlands, breathing, in his despatches\r\nto Henry, threatenings and slaughter against Charles's misleaders. His\r\ndescent on Flanders eclipsed his march on Milan. \"Mon fils,\" he said\r\nto Charles, \"vous allez tromper les Francais, et moi, je vais tromper\r\nles Anglais.\"[233] So far from breaking the Treaty of Noyon, he    (p. 094)\r\njoined it himself, and at Brussels solemnly swore to observe its\r\nprovisions. He probably thought he had touched the bottom of Henry's\r\npurse, and that it was time to dip into Francis's. Seventy-five\r\nthousand crowns was his price for betraying Henry.[234]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 228: On 23rd Jan. (_L. and P._, ii.,\r\n                   1541, 1610).

Charles would not wait to marry Francis's daughter, and\r\nthen the breach would come.[237] Henry and Wolsey had the good sense\r\nto act on this sound advice. Maximilian, Francis and Charles formed at\r\nCambrai a fresh league for the partition of Italy,[238] but they were\r\nsoon at enmity and too much involved with their own affairs to think\r\nof the conquest of others. Disaffection was rife in Spain, where a\r\nparty wished Ferdinand, Charles's brother, to be King.[239] If Charles\r\nwas to retain his Spanish kingdoms, he must visit them at once. He\r\ncould not go unless England provided the means. His request for    (p. 095)\r\na loan was graciously accorded and his ambassadors were treated with\r\nmagnificent courtesy.[240] \"One day,\" says Chieregati,[241] the papal\r\nenvoy in England, \"the King sent for these ambassadors, and kept them\r\nto dine with him privately in his chamber with the Queen, a very\r\nunusual proceeding. After dinner he took to singing and playing on\r\nevery musical instrument, and exhibited a part of his very excellent\r\nendowments. At length he commenced dancing,\" and, continues another\r\nnarrator, \"doing marvellous things, both in dancing and jumping,\r\nproving himself, as he is in truth, indefatigable.\" On another day\r\nthere was \"a most stately joust.\" Henry was magnificently attired in\r\n\"cloth of silver with a raised pile, and wrought throughout with\r\nemblematic letters\". When he had made the usual display in the lists,\r\nthe Duke of Suffolk entered from the other end, with well-nigh equal\r\narray and pomp. He was accompanied by fourteen other jousters. \"The\r\nKing wanted to joust with all of them; but this was forbidden by the\r\ncouncil, which, moreover, decided that each jouster was to run six\r\ncourses and no more, so that the entertainment might be ended on that\r\nday.... The competitor assigned to the King was the Duke of Suffolk;\r\nand they bore themselves so bravely that the spectators fancied\r\nthemselves witnessing a joust between Hector and Achilles.\" \"They\r\ntilted,\" says Sagudino, \"eight courses, both shivering their lances at\r\nevery time, to the great applause of the spectators.\" Chieregati\r\ncontinues: \"On arriving in the lists the King presented himself before\r\nthe Queen and the ladies, making a thousand jumps in the air, and  (p. 096)\r\nafter tiring one horse, he entered the tent and mounted another...\r\ndoing this constantly, and reappearing in the lists until the end of\r\nthe jousts\". Dinner was then served, amid a scene of unparalleled\r\nsplendour, and Chieregati avers that the \"guests remained at table for\r\nseven hours by the clock\". The display of costume on the King's part\r\nwas equally varied and gorgeous. On one occasion he wore \"stiff\r\nbrocade in the Hungarian fashion,\" on another, he \"was dressed in\r\nwhite damask in the Turkish fashion, the above-mentioned robe all\r\nembroidered with roses, made of rubies and diamonds\"; on a third, he\r\n\"wore royal robes down to the ground, of gold brocade lined with\r\nermine\"; while \"all the rest of the Court glittered with jewels and\r\ngold and silver, the pomp being unprecedented\".\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 235: _Ibid._, ii., 2923, 2940.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 236: _Ibid._, ii., 2910.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 237: _Ibid._, ii., 2930.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 238: _Ibid._, ii., 2632, 3008; _Monumenta\r\n                   Habsburgica_, ii., 37.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 239: _L. and P._, ii., 3076, 3077, 3081.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 240: _L. and P._, ii., 3402, 3439-41.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 241: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 918; _L. and P._,\r\n                   ii., 3455, 3462.]\r\n\r\nAll this riot of wealth would no doubt impress the impecunious\r\nCharles. In September he landed in Spain, so destitute that he was\r\nglad to accept the offer of a hobby from the English ambassador.[242]\r\nAt the first meeting of his Cortes, they demanded that he should marry\r\nat once, and not wait for Francis's daughter; the bride his subjects\r\ndesired was the daughter of the King of Portugal.[243] They were no\r\nmore willing to part with Navarre; and Charles was forced to make to\r\nFrancis the feeble excuse that he was not aware, when he was in the\r\nNetherlands, of his true title to Navarre, but had learnt it since his\r\narrival in Spain; he also declined the personal interview to which\r\nFrancis invited him.[244] A rupture between Francis and Charles was\r\nonly a question of time; and, to prepare for it, both were anxious (p. 097)\r\nfor England's alliance. Throughout the autumn of 1517 and spring of\r\n1518, France and England were feeling their way towards friendship.\r\nAlbany had left Scotland, so that source of irritation was gone. Henry\r\nhad now a daughter, Mary, and Francis a son. \"I will unite them,\" said\r\nWolsey;[245] and in October, 1518, not only was a treaty of marriage\r\nand alliance signed between England and France, but a general peace\r\nfor Europe. Leo X. sent Campeggio with blessings of peace from the\r\nVicar of Christ, though he was kept chafing at Calais for three\r\nmonths, till he could bring with him Leo's appointment of Wolsey as\r\nlegate and the deposition of Wolsey's enemy, Hadrian, from the\r\nBishopric of Bath and Wells.[246] The ceremonies exceeded in splendour\r\neven those of the year before. They included, says Giustinian, a \"most\r\nsumptuous supper\" at Wolsey's house, \"the like of which, I fancy, was\r\nnever given by Cleopatra or Caligula; the whole banqueting hall being\r\nso decorated with huge vases of gold and silver, that I fancied myself\r\nin the tower of Chosroes,[247] when that monarch caused Divine honours\r\nto be paid him. After supper... twelve male and twelve female dancers\r\nmade their appearance in the richest and most sumptuous array possible,\r\nbeing all dressed alike.... They were disguised in one suit of fine\r\ngreen satin, all over covered with cloth of gold, undertied together\r\nwith laces of gold, and had masking hoods on their heads; the ladies\r\nhad tires made of braids of damask gold, with long hairs of white\r\ngold. All these maskers danced at one time, and after they had danced\r\nthey put off their visors, and then they were all known.... The    (p. 098)\r\ntwo leaders were the King and the Queen Dowager of France, and all the\r\nothers were lords and ladies.\"[248] These festivities were followed by\r\nthe formal ratification of peace.[249] Approval of it was general, and\r\nthe old councillors who had been alienated by Wolsey's Milan expedition,\r\nhastened to applaud. \"It was the best deed,\" wrote Fox to Wolsey,\r\n\"that ever was done for England, and, next to the King, the praise of\r\nit is due to you.\"[250] Once more the wheel had come round, and the\r\nstone of Sisyphus was lodged more secure than before some way up the\r\nside of the hill.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 242: _L. and P._, ii., 3705.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 243: _Ibid._, ii., 4022.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 244: _Ibid._, ii., 4164, 4188.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 245: _L. and P._, ii., 4047.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 246: _Ibid._, ii., 4348.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 247: Chosroes I.

He was writing to Charles that it was useless to\r\nexpect the Empire unless he would spend at least as much as the\r\nFrench.[251] \"It would be lamentable,\" he said, \"if we should now lose\r\nall through some pitiful omission or penurious neglect;\" and Francis\r\nwas \"going about covertly and laying many baits,\"[252] to attain   (p. 099)\r\nthe imperial crown. To Henry himself Maximilian had more than once\r\noffered the prize, and Pace had declared that the offer was only\r\nanother design for extracting Henry's gold \"for the electors would\r\nnever allow the crown to go out of their nation\".[253] The Emperor had\r\nfirst proposed it while serving under Henry's banners in France.[254]\r\nHe renewed the suggestion in 1516, inviting Henry to meet him at\r\nCoire. The brothers in arms were thence to cross the Alps to Milan,\r\nwhere the Emperor would invest the English King with the duchy; he\r\nwould then take him on to Rome, resign the Empire himself, and have\r\nHenry crowned. Not that Maximilian desired to forsake all earthly\r\nauthority; he sought to combine a spiritual with a temporal glory; he\r\nwas to lay down the imperial crown and place on his brows the papal\r\ntiara.[255] Nothing was too fantastic for the Emperor Maximilian; the\r\nman who could not wrest a few towns from Venice was always deluding\r\nhimself with the hope of leading victorious hosts to the seat of the\r\nTurkish Empire and the Holy City of Christendom; the sovereign whose\r\nmain incentive in life was gold, informed his daughter that he\r\nintended to get himself canonised, and that after his death she would\r\nhave to adore him. He died at Welz on 12th January, 1519, neither Pope\r\nnor saint, with Jerusalem still in the hands of the Turk, and the\r\nsuccession to the Empire still undecided.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 251: _Ibid._, ii., 4172.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 252: _L. and P._, ii., 4159.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 253: _Ibid._, ii., 1923.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 254: _Ibid._, ii., 1398, 1878, 1902,\r\n                   2218, 2911, 4257.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 255: _Cf._ W. Boehm, _Hat Kaiser\r\n                   Maximilian I. im Jahre 1511 Papst werden wollen?_\r\n                   1873.]\r\n\r\nThe contest now broke out in earnest, and the electors prepared    (p. 100)\r\nto garner their harvest of gold. The price of a vote was a hundredfold\r\nmore than the most corrupt parliamentary elector could conceive in his\r\nwildest dreams of avarice. There were only seven electors and the prize\r\nwas the greatest on earth. Francis I. said he was ready to spend\r\n3,000,000 crowns, and Charles could not afford to lag far behind.[256]\r\nThe Margrave of Brandenburg, \"the father of all greediness,\" as the\r\nAustrians called him, was particularly influential because his brother,\r\nthe Archbishop of Mainz, was also an elector and he required an\r\nespecially exorbitant bribe. He was ambitious as well as covetous, and\r\nthe rivals endeavoured to satisfy his ambitions with matrimonial\r\nprizes. He was promised Ferdinand's widow, Germaine de Foix; Francis\r\nsought to parry this blow by offering to the Margrave's son the French\r\nPrincess Renee; Charles bid higher by offering his sister Catherine.[257]\r\nFrancis relied much on his personal graces, the military renown he had\r\nwon by the conquest of Northern Italy, and the assistance of Leo. With\r\nthe Pope he concluded a fresh treaty that year for the conquest of\r\nFerrara, the extension of the papal States, and the settlement of\r\nNaples on Francis's second son, on condition that it was meanwhile to\r\nbe administered by papal legates,[258] and that its king was to\r\nabstain from all interference in spiritual matters. Charles, on the\r\nother hand, owed his advantages to his position and not to his person.\r\nCold, reserved and formal, he possessed none of the physical or\r\nintellectual graces of Francis I. and Henry VIII. He excelled in   (p. 101)\r\nno sport, was unpleasant in features and repellent in manners. No\r\ngleam of magnanimity or chivalry lightened his character, no deeds in\r\nwar or statecraft yet sounded his fame. He was none the less heir of\r\nthe Austrian House, which for generations had worn the imperial crown;\r\nas such, too, he was a German prince, and the Germanic constitution\r\nforbade any other the sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire. Against\r\nthis was the fact that his enormous dominions, including Naples and\r\nSpain, would preclude his continued residence in Germany and might\r\nthreaten the liberties of the German people.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 256: For details of the sums promised to\r\n                   the various German princes see _L. and P._, iii.,\r\n                   36, etc.; it has been said that there was really\r\n                   little or no bribery at this election.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 257: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1165, 1187; _L.\r\n                   and P._, ii., 4159; iii., 130.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 258: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 267.]\r\n\r\nBut was there no third candidate? Leo at heart regarded the election\r\nof either as an absolute evil.[259] He had always dreaded Maximilian's\r\nclaims to the temporal power of the Church, though Maximilian held not\r\na foot of Italian soil. How much more would he dread those claims in\r\nthe hands of Francis or Charles! One threatened the papal States from\r\nMilan, and the other from Naples. Of the two, he feared Francis the\r\nless;[260] for the union of Naples with the Empire had been such a\r\nterror to the Popes, that before granting the investiture of that\r\nkingdom, they bound its king by oath not to compete for the Empire.[261]\r\nBut a third candidate would offer an escape from between the upper and\r\nthe nether mill-stone; and Leo suggested at one time Charles's brother\r\nFerdinand,[262] at another a German elector. Precisely the same\r\nrecommendations had been secretly made by Henry VIII. In public he\r\nfollowed the course he commended to Leo; he advocated the claims   (p. 102)\r\nof both Charles and Francis, when asked so to do, but sent trusty\r\nenvoys with his testimonials to explain that no credence was to be\r\ngiven them.[263] He told the French King that he favoured the election\r\nof Francis, and the Spanish King the election of Charles, but like Leo\r\nhe desired in truth the election of neither. Why should he not come\r\nforward himself? His dominions were not so extensive that, when\r\ncombined with the imperial dignity, they would threaten to dominate\r\nEurope; and his election might seem to provide a useful check in the\r\nbalance of power. In March he had already told Francis that his claims\r\nwere favoured by some of the electors, though he professed a wish to\r\npromote the French King's pretensions. In May, Pace was sent to\r\nGermany with secret instructions to endeavour to balance the parties\r\nand force the electors into a deadlock, from which the only escape\r\nwould be the election of a third candidate, either Henry himself or\r\nsome German prince. It is difficult to believe that Henry really\r\nthought his election possible or was seriously pushing his claim. He\r\nhad repeatedly declined Maximilian's offers; he had been as often\r\nwarned by trusty advisers that no non-German prince stood a chance of\r\nelection; he had expressed his content with his own islands, which,\r\nTunstall told him with truth, were an Empire worth more than the\r\nbarren imperial crown.[264] Pace went far too late to secure a party\r\nfor Henry, and, what was even more fatal, he went without the\r\npersuasive of money. Norfolk told Giustinian, after Pace's departure,\r\nthat the election would fall on a German prince, and such, said the\r\nVenetian, was the universal belief and desire in England.[265]     (p. 103)\r\nAfter the election, Leo expressed his \"regret that Henry gave no\r\nattention to a project which would have made him a near, instead of a\r\ndistant, neighbour of the papal States\". Under the circumstances, it\r\nseems more probable that the first alternative in Pace's instructions\r\nno more represented a settled design in Henry's mind than his\r\noften-professed intention of conquering France, and that the real\r\npurport of his mission was to promote the election of the Duke of\r\nSaxony or another German prince.[266]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 259: _L. and P._, iii., 149.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 260: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1227.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 261: _Ibid._, ii., 1246.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 262: _Ibid._, ii., 1163.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 263: _L. and P._, iii., 137.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 264: _Ibid._, ii., 2911.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 265: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1220.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 266: _L. and P._, ii., 241.]\r\n\r\nWhether that was its object or not the mission was foredoomed to\r\nfailure. The conclusion was never really in doubt. Electors might\r\ntrouble the waters in order to fish with more success. They might\r\npretend to Francis that if he was free with his money he might be\r\nelected, and to Charles that unless he was free with his money he\r\nwould not, but no sufficient reason had been shown why they should\r\nviolate national prejudices, the laws of the Empire, and prescriptive\r\nhereditary right, in order to place Henry or Francis instead of a\r\nGerman upon the imperial throne. Neither people nor princes nor\r\nbarons, wrote Leo's envoys, would permit the election of the Most\r\nChristian King;[267] and even if the electors wished to elect him, it\r\nwas not in their power to do so. The whole of the nation, said Pace,\r\nwas in arms and furious for Charles; and had Henry been elected, they\r\nwould in their indignation have killed Pace and all his servants.[268]\r\nThe voice of the German people spoke in no uncertain tones; they would\r\nhave Charles and no other to be their ruler. Leo himself saw the   (p. 104)\r\nfutility of resistance, and making a virtue of necessity, he sent\r\nCharles an absolution from his oath as King of Naples. As soon as it\r\narrived, the electors unanimously declared Charles their Emperor on\r\n28th June.[269]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 267: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1227.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 268: _L. and P._, iii., 326.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 269: _L. and P._, iii., 339.]\r\n\r\nThus was completed the shuffling of the cards for the struggle which\r\nlasted till Henry's death. Francis had now succeeded to Louis, Charles\r\nto both his grandfathers, and Henry at twenty-eight was the _doyen_ of\r\nthe princes of Europe. He was two years older than Francis and eight\r\nyears older than Charles. Europe had passed under the rule of youthful\r\ntriumvirs whose rivalry troubled its peace and guided its destinies\r\nfor nearly thirty years. The youngest of all was the greatest in\r\npower. His dominions, it is true, were disjointed, and funds were\r\noften to seek, but these defects have been overrated. It was neither\r\nof these which proved his greatest embarrassment. It was a cloud in\r\nGermany, as yet no bigger than a man's hand, but soon to darken the\r\nface of Europe. Ferdinand and Maximilian had at times been dangerous;\r\nCharles wielded the power of both. He ruled over Castile and Aragon,\r\nthe Netherlands and Naples, Burgundy and Austria; he could command the\r\nfinest military forces in Europe; the infantry of Spain, the science\r\nof Italy, the lance-knights of Germany, for which Ferdinand sighed,\r\nwere at his disposal; and the wealth of the Indies was poured out at\r\nhis feet. He bestrode the narrow world like a Colossus, and the only\r\nhope of lesser men lay in the maintenance of Francis's power. Were\r\nthat to fail, Charles would become arbiter of Christendom, Italy a\r\nSpanish kingdom, and the Pope little more than the Emperor's       (p. 105)\r\nchaplain. \"Great masters,\" said Tunstall, with reference to a papal\r\nbrief urged by Charles in excuse for his action in 1517, \"could get\r\ngreat clerks to say what they liked.\"[270] The mastery of Charles in\r\n1517 was but the shadow of what it became ten years later; and if\r\nunder its dominance \"the great clerk\" were called upon to decide\r\nbetween \"the great master\" and Henry, it was obvious already that all\r\nHenry's services to the Papacy would count for nothing.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 270: _L. and P._, ii., 3054.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the present, those services were to be remembered. They were not,\r\nindeed, inconsiderable. It would be absurd to maintain that, since his\r\naccession, Henry had been actuated by respect for the Papacy more than\r\nby another motive; but it is indisputable that that motive had entered\r\nmore largely into his conduct than into that of any other monarch.\r\nJames IV. and Louis had been excommunicated, Maximilian had obstinately\r\ncountenanced a schismatic council and wished to arrogate to himself\r\nthe Pope's temporal power. Ferdinand's zeal for his house had eaten\r\nhim up and left little room for less selfish impulses; his anxiety for\r\nwar with the Moor or the Turk was but a cloak; and the value of his\r\nfrequent demands for a Reformation may be gauged by his opinion that\r\nnever was there more need for the Inquisition, and by his anger with\r\nLeo for refusing the Inquisitors the preferments he asked.[271] From\r\nhypocrisy like Ferdinand's Henry was, in his early years, singularly\r\nfree, and the devotion to the Holy See, which he inherited, was of a\r\nmore than conventional type. \"He is very religious,\" wrote         (p. 106)\r\nGiustinian, \"and hears three masses daily when he hunts, and sometimes\r\nfive on other days. He hears the office every day in the Queen's chamber,\r\nthat is to say, vesper and compline.\"[272] The best theologians and\r\ndoctors in his kingdom were regularly required to preach at his Court,\r\nwhen their fee for each sermon was equivalent to ten or twelve pounds.\r\nHe was generous in his almsgiving, and his usual offering on Sundays\r\nand saints' days was six shillings and eightpence or, in modern\r\ncurrency, nearly four pounds; often it was double that amount, and\r\nthere were special offerings besides, such as the twenty shillings he\r\nsent every year to the shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury. In January,\r\n1511, the gentlemen of the King's chapel were paid what would now be\r\nseventy-five pounds for praying for the Queen's safe delivery, and\r\nsimilar sums were no doubt paid on other occasions.[273] In 1513,\r\nCatherine thought Henry's success was all due to his zeal for\r\nreligion,[274] and a year or two later Erasmus wrote that Henry's\r\nCourt was an example to all Christendom for learning and piety.[275]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 271: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 80, 89, 167, 175.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 272: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1287; Giustinian,\r\n                   _Desp._, ii., App., 309; _L. and P._, iii., 402.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 273: These details are from the King's\r\n                   \"Book of Payments\" calendared at the end of _L. and\r\n                   P._, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 274: _L. and P._, i., 4417.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 275: _Ibid._, ii., 4115.]\r\n\r\nPiety went hand in hand with a filial respect for the head of the\r\nChurch. Not once in the ten years is there to be found any expression\r\nfrom Henry of contempt for the Pope, whether he was Julius II. or Leo\r\nX. There had been no occasion on which Pope and King had been brought\r\ninto conflict, and almost throughout they had acted in perfect harmony.\r\nIt was the siege of Julius by Louis that drew Henry from his peaceful\r\npolicy to intervene as the champion of the Papal See, and it was   (p. 107)\r\nas the executor of papal censures that he made war on France.[276] If\r\nhe had ulterior views on that kingdom, he could plead the justification\r\nof a brief, drawn up if not published, by Julius II., investing him\r\nwith the French crown.[277] A papal envoy came to urge peace in 1514,\r\nand a Pope claimed first to have suggested the marriage between Mary\r\nand Louis.[278] The Milan expedition of 1516 was made under cover of a\r\nnew Holy League concluded in the spring of the previous year, and the\r\npeace of 1518 was made with the full approval and blessings of Leo.\r\nHenry's devotion had been often acknowledged in words, and twice by\r\ntangible tokens of gratitude, in the gift of the golden rose in 1510\r\nand of the sword and cap in 1513.[279] But did not his services merit\r\nsome more signal mark of favour? If Ferdinand was \"Catholic,\" and\r\nLouis \"Most Christian,\" might not some title be found for a genuine\r\nfriend? And, as early as 1515, Henry was pressing the Pope for \"some\r\ntitle as protector of the Holy See\".[280] Various names were suggested,\r\n\"King Apostolic,\" \"King Orthodox,\" and others; and in January, 1516,\r\nwe find the first mention of \"Fidei Defensor\".[281] But the prize was\r\nto be won by services more appropriate to the title than even ten\r\nyears' maintenance of the Pope's temporal interests. His championship\r\nof the Holy See had been the most unselfish part of Henry's policy\r\nsince he came to the throne; and his whole conduct had been an\r\nexample, which others were slow to follow, and which Henry himself was\r\nsoon to neglect.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 276: _L. and P._, i., 3876, 4283.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 277: _Arch.

(p. 108)\r\n\r\nKING AND CARDINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" wrote Giustinian of Wolsey in 1519, \"pleases him more than\r\nto be called the arbiter of Christendom.\"[282] Continental statesmen\r\nwere inclined to ridicule and resent the Cardinal's claim. But the\r\ntitle hardly exaggerates the part which the English minister was\r\nenabled to play during the next few years by the rivalry of Charles\r\nand Francis, and by the apparently even balance of their powers. The\r\nposition which England held in the councils of Europe in 1519 was a\r\nmarvellous advance upon that which it had occupied in 1509. The first\r\nten years of Henry's reign had been a period of fluctuating, but\r\ncontinual, progress. The campaign of 1513 had vindicated England's\r\nmilitary prowess, and had made it possible for Wolsey, at the peace of\r\nthe following year, to place his country on a level with France and\r\nSpain and the Empire. Francis's conquest of Milan, and the haste with\r\nwhich Maximilian, Leo and Charles sought to make terms with the\r\nvictor, caused a temporary isolation of England and a consequent\r\ndecline in her influence. But the arrangements made between Charles\r\nand Francis contained, in themselves, as acute English diplomatists\r\nsaw, the seeds of future disruption; and, in 1518, Wolsey was able (p. 109)\r\nso to play off these mutual jealousies as to reassert England's\r\nposition. He imposed a general peace, or rather a truce, which raised\r\nEngland even higher than the treaties of 1514 had done, and made her\r\nappear as the conservator of the peace of Europe. England had almost\r\nusurped the place of the Pope as mediator between rival Christian\r\nprinces.[283]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 282: _L. and P._, iii., 125; Giustinian,\r\n                   _Desp._, ii., 256.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 283: _L. and P._, iii., 125. Men were\r\n                   shocked when the Pope was styled \"comes\" instead of\r\n                   \"princeps confederationis\" of 1518. \"The chief\r\n                   author of these proceedings,\" says Giustinian, \"is\r\n                   Wolsey, whose sole aim is to procure incense for\r\n                   his king and himself\" (_Desp._ ii., 256).]\r\n\r\nThese brilliant results were achieved with the aid of very moderate\r\nmilitary forces and an only respectable navy. They were due partly to\r\nthe lavish expenditure of Henry's treasures, partly to the extravagant\r\nfaith of other princes in the extent of England's wealth, but mainly\r\nto the genius for diplomacy displayed by the great English Cardinal.\r\nWolsey had now reached the zenith of his power; and the growth of his\r\nsense of his own importance is graphically described by the Venetian\r\nambassador. When Giustinian first arrived in England, Wolsey used to\r\nsay, \"His Majesty will do so and so\". Subsequently, by degrees,\r\nforgetting himself, he commenced saying, \"We shall do so and so\". In\r\n1519 he had reached such a pitch that he used to say, \"I shall do so\r\nand so\".[284] Fox had been called by Badoer \"a second King,\" but\r\nWolsey was now \"the King himself\".[285] \"We have to deal,\" said Fox,\r\n\"with the Cardinal, who is not Cardinal, but King; and no one in the\r\nrealm dares attempt aught in opposition to his interests.\"[286] On\r\nanother occasion Giustinian remarks: \"This Cardinal is King, nor does\r\nHis Majesty depart in the least from the opinion and counsel of    (p. 110)\r\nhis lordship\".[287] Sir Thomas More, in describing the negotiations\r\nfor the peace of 1518, reports that only after Wolsey had concluded a\r\npoint did he tell the council, \"so that even the King hardly knows in\r\nwhat state matters are\".[288] A month or two later there was a curious\r\ndispute between the Earl of Worcester and West, Bishop of Ely, who\r\nwere sent to convey the Treaty of London to Francis. Worcester, as a\r\nlayman, was a partisan of the King, West of the Cardinal. Worcester\r\ninsisted that their detailed letters should be addressed to Henry, and\r\nonly general ones to Wolsey. West refused; the important letters, he\r\nthought, should go to the Cardinal, the formal ones to the King; and,\r\neventually, identical despatches were sent to both.[289] In\r\nnegotiations with England, Giustinian told his Government, \"if it were\r\nnecessary to neglect either King or Cardinal, it would be better to\r\npass over the King; he would therefore make the proposal to both, but\r\nto the Cardinal first, _lest he should resent the precedence conceded\r\nto the King_\".[290] The popular charge against Wolsey, repeated by\r\nShakespeare, of having written _Ego et rex meus_, though true in\r\nfact,[291] is false in intention, because no Latin scholar could put\r\nthe words in any other order; but the Cardinal's mental attitude is\r\nfaithfully represented in the meaning which the familiar phrase was\r\nsupposed to convey.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 284: _Ven._ Cal., ii. 1287.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 285: _L. and P._, ii., 1380.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 286: _Ibid._, ii., 3558.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 287: _Cf.

On other\r\n                   occasions Wolsey took it upon himself to open\r\n                   letters addressed to the King (_Ibid._, iii.,\r\n                   2126).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 290: _Ven.

He did not dismount from his mule,\r\nbut merely doffed his cap, and embraced as a brother the temporal head\r\nof Christendom.[295] When, after a dispute with the Venetian ambassador,\r\nhe wished to be friendly, he allowed Giustinian, with royal condescension,\r\nand as a special mark of favour, to kiss his hand.[296] He never\r\ngranted audience either to English peers or foreign ambassadors until\r\nthe third or fourth time of asking.[297] In 1515 it was the custom of\r\nambassadors to dine with Wolsey before presentation at Court, but four\r\nyears later they were never served until the viands had been removed\r\nfrom the Cardinal's table.[298] A Venetian, describing Wolsey's    (p. 112)\r\nembassy to France in 1527, relates that his \"attendants served cap in\r\nhand, and, when bringing the dishes, knelt before him in the act of\r\npresenting them. Those who waited on the Most Christian King, kept\r\ntheir caps on their heads, dispensing with such exaggerated\r\nceremonies.\"[299]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 292: _Ven. Cal._, iii., 56.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 293: _Ibid._, iii., 50.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 294: _Ibid._, vol. iii., p. 29.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 295: _Ibid._, iii., 298.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 296: _L. and P._, ii., 3733.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 297: Giustinian, _Desp._, App. ii., 309.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 298: Giustinian, _Desp._, App. ii., 309.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 299: _Ven. Cal._, iii., p. 84.]\r\n\r\nPretenders to royal honours seldom acquire the grace of genuine\r\nroyalty, and the Cardinal pursued with vindictive ferocity those who\r\noffended his sensitive dignity. In 1515, Polydore Vergil said, in\r\nwriting to his friend, Cardinal Hadrian, that Wolsey was so tyrannical\r\ntowards all men that his influence could not last, and that all\r\nEngland abused him.[300] The letter was copied by Wolsey's secretary,\r\nVergil was sent to the Tower,[301] and only released after many months\r\nat the repeated intercession of Leo X. His correspondent, Cardinal\r\nHadrian, was visited with Wolsey's undying hatred. A pretext for his\r\nruin was found in his alleged complicity in a plot to poison the Pope;\r\nthe charge was trivial, and Leo forgave him.[302] Not so Wolsey, who\r\nprocured Hadrian's deprivation of the Bishopric of Bath and Wells,\r\nappropriated the see for himself, and in 1518 kept Campeggio, the\r\nPope's legate, chafing at Calais until he could bring with him the\r\npapal confirmation of these measures.[303] Venice had the temerity to\r\nintercede with Leo on Hadrian's behalf; Wolsey thereupon overwhelmed\r\nGiustinian with \"rabid and insolent language\"; ordered him not to  (p. 113)\r\nput anything in his despatches without his consent; and revoked the\r\nprivileges of Venetian merchants in England.[304] In these outbursts\r\nof fury, he paid little respect to the sacrosanct character of\r\nambassadors. He heard that the papal nuncio, Chieregati, was sending\r\nto France unfavourable reports of his conduct. The nuncio \"was sent\r\nfor by Wolsey, who took him into a private chamber, laid rude hands\r\nupon him, fiercely demanding what he had written to the King of\r\nFrance, and what intercourse he had held with Giustinian and his son,\r\nadding that he should not quit the spot until he had confessed\r\neverything, and, if fair means were not sufficient, he should be put\r\nupon the rack\".[305] Nine years later, Wolsey nearly precipitated war\r\nbetween England and the Emperor by a similar outburst against\r\nCharles's ambassador, De Praet. He intercepted De Praet's\r\ncorrespondence, and confined him to his house. It was a flagrant\r\nbreach of international law. Tampering with diplomatic correspondence\r\nwas usually considered a sufficient cause for war; on this occasion\r\nwar did not suit Charles's purpose, but it was no fault of Wolsey's\r\nthat his fury at an alleged personal slight did not provoke\r\nhostilities with the most powerful prince in Christendom.[306]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 300: _L. and P._, ii., 215.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 301: _Ibid._, ii., 491, 865, 1229.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 302: _Ibid._, ii., 3581, 3584; _Ven.\r\n                   Cal._, ii., 902, 951.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 303: _L. and P._, ii., 4348.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 304: _Ven.

Cal._, iii., pp. 50, 76, 78,\r\n                   92.]\r\n\r\nEnglishmen fared no better than others at Wolsey's hands. He used the\r\ncoercive power of the State to revenge his private wrongs as well as\r\nto secure the peace of the realm. In July, 1517, Sir Robert Sheffield,[307]\r\nwho had been Speaker in two Parliaments, was sent to the Tower for\r\ncomplaining of Wolsey, and to point the moral of Fox's assertion,  (p. 114)\r\nthat none durst do ought in opposition to the Cardinal's interests.[308]\r\nAgain, the idea reflected by Shakespeare, that Wolsey was jealous of\r\nPace, has been described as absurd; but it is difficult to draw any\r\nother inference from the relations between them after 1521. While\r\nWolsey was absent at Calais, he accused Pace, without ground, of\r\nmisrepresenting his letters to Henry, and of obtaining Henry's favour\r\non behalf of a canon of York;[309] he complained that foreign powers\r\nwere trusting to another influence than his over the King; and, when\r\nhe returned, he took care that Pace should henceforth be employed, not\r\nas secretary to Henry, but on almost continuous missions to Italy. In\r\n1525, when the Venetian ambassador was to thank Henry for making a\r\ntreaty with Venice, which Pace had concluded, he was instructed not to\r\npraise him so highly, if the Cardinal were present, as if the oration\r\nwere made to Henry alone;[310] and, four years later, Wolsey found an\r\noccasion for sending Pace to the Tower--treatment which eventually\r\ncaused Pace's mind to become unhinged.[311]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 307: _L. and P._, ii., 3487.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 308: _L. and P._, ii., 3558.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 309: _Ibid._, iii., 1713.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 310: _Ven.

It\r\n                   is rather an instance of the lengths to which\r\n                   Brewer's zeal for Wolsey carried him. He had not\r\n                   seen the despatch from Mendoza recording Pace's\r\n                   committal to the Tower on 25th Oct., 1527, \"for\r\n                   speaking to the King in opposition to Wolsey and\r\n                   the divorce\" (_Sp. Cal._, 1527-29, p. 440). It is\r\n                   true that Pace was in the charge of the Bishop of\r\n                   Bangor, but he was not transferred thither until\r\n                   1528 (Ellis, _Orig. Letters_, 3rd ser., ii., 151);\r\n                   he was released immediately upon Wolsey's fall.\r\n                   Erasmus, thereupon, congratulating him on the fact,\r\n                   remarked that he was consoled by Pace's experience\r\n                   for his own persecution and that God rescued the\r\n                   innocent and cast down the proud (_ibid._, iv.,\r\n                   6283). The _D.N.B._ (xliii., 24), has been misled\r\n                   by Brewer. Wolsey had long had a grudge against\r\n                   Pace, and in 1514 was anxious to make \"a fearful\r\n                   example\" of him (_L. and P._, i., 5465); and his\r\n                   treatment of Pace was one of the charges brought\r\n                   against him in 1529 (_ibid._, iv., p. 2552).]\r\n\r\nWolsey's pride in himself, and his jealousy of others, were not    (p. 115)\r\nmore conspicuous than his thirst after riches. His fees as Chancellor\r\nwere reckoned by Giustinian at five thousand ducats a year. He made\r\nthrice that sum by New Year's presents, \"which he receives like the\r\nKing\".[312] His demand for the Bishopric of Bath and Wells, coupled\r\nwith the fact that it was he who petitioned for Hadrian's deprivation,\r\namazed even the Court at Rome, and, \"to avoid murmurs,\"[313] compliance\r\nwas deferred for a time. But these scruples were allowed no more than\r\necclesiastical law to stand in the way of Wolsey's preferment. One of\r\nthe small reforms decreed by the Lateran Council was that no bishoprics\r\nshould be held _in commendam_; the ink was scarcely dry when Wolsey\r\nasked _in commendam_ for the see of the recently conquered Tournay.[314]\r\nTournay was restored to France in 1518, but the Cardinal took care\r\nthat he should not be the loser. A _sine qua non_ of the peace was\r\nthat Francis should pay him an annual pension of twelve thousand\r\nlivres as compensation for the loss of a bishopric of which he had\r\nnever obtained possession.[315] He drew other pensions for political\r\nservices, from both Francis and Charles; and, from the Duke of Milan,\r\nhe obtained the promise of ten thousand ducats a year before Pace  (p. 116)\r\nset out to recover the duchy.[316] It is scarcely a matter for wonder\r\nthat foreign diplomatists, and Englishmen, too, should have accused\r\nWolsey of spending the King's money for his own profit, and have\r\nthought that the surest way of winning his favour was by means of a\r\nbribe.[317] When England, in 1521, sided with Charles against Francis,\r\nthe Emperor bound himself to make good to Wolsey all the sums he would\r\nlose by a breach with France; and from that year onwards Charles\r\npaid--or owed--Wolsey eighteen thousand livres a year.[318] It was\r\nnine times the pensions considered sufficient for the Dukes of Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk; and even so it does not include the revenue Wolsey\r\nderived from two Spanish bishoprics. These were not bribes in the\r\nsense that they affected Wolsey's policy; they were well enough known\r\nto the King; to spoil the Egyptians was considered fair game, and\r\nHenry was generous enough not to keep all the perquisites of peace or\r\nwar for himself.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 312: Giustinian, _Desp._, App. ii., 309.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 313: _Ven.

Cal._, ii., 273, 600. In 1527 Charles\r\n                   instructed his ambassador to offer Wolsey in\r\n                   addition to his pension of nine thousand ducats\r\n                   with arrears a further pension of six thousand\r\n                   ducats and a marquisate in Milan worth another\r\n                   twelve or fifteen thousand ducats a year (_L. and\r\n                   P._, iv., 3464).]\r\n\r\nTwo years after the agreement with Charles, Ruthal, Bishop of Durham,\r\ndied, and Wolsey exchanged Bath and Wells for the richer see formerly\r\nheld by his political ally and friend. But Winchester was richer   (p. 117)\r\neven than Durham; so when Fox followed Ruthal to the grave, in 1528,\r\nWolsey exchanged the northern for the southern see, and begged that\r\nDurham might go to his natural son, a youth of eighteen.[319] All\r\nthese were held _in commendam_ with the Archbishopric of York, but\r\nthey did not satisfy Wolsey; and, in 1521, he obtained the grant of\r\nSt. Albans, the greatest abbey in England. His palaces outshone in\r\nsplendour those of Henry himself, and few monarchs have been able to\r\ndisplay such wealth of plate as loaded the Cardinal's table. Wolsey is\r\nsupposed to have conceived vast schemes of ecclesiastical reform,\r\nwhich time and opportunity failed him to effect.[320] If he had ever\r\nseriously set about the work, the first thing to be reformed would\r\nhave been his own ecclesiastical practice. He personified in himself\r\nmost of the clerical abuses of his age. Not merely an \"unpreaching\r\nprelate,\" he rarely said mass; his _commendams_ and absenteeism were\r\nalike violations of canon law. Three of the bishoprics he held he\r\nnever visited at all; York, which he had obtained fifteen years\r\nbefore, he did not visit till the year of his death, and then through\r\nno wish of his own. He was equally negligent of the vow of chastity;\r\nhe cohabited with the daughter of \"one Lark,\" a relative of the Lark\r\nwho is mentioned in the correspondence of the time as \"omnipotent\"\r\nwith the Cardinal, and as resident in his household.[321] By her   (p. 118)\r\nhe left two children, a son,[322] for whom he obtained a deanery, four\r\narchdeaconries, five prebends, and a chancellorship, and sought the\r\nBishopric of Durham, and a daughter who became a nun. The accusation\r\nbrought against him by the Duke of Buckingham and others, of procuring\r\nobjects for Henry's sensual appetite, is a scandal, to which no\r\ncredence would have been attached but for Wolsey's own moral laxity,\r\nand the fact that the governor of Charles V. performed a similar\r\noffice.[323]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 319: _L. and P._, iv., 4824.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 320: There is no doubt about his\r\n                   eagerness for the power which would have enabled\r\n                   him to carry out a reformation. As legate he\r\n                   demanded from the Pope authority to visit and\r\n                   reform the secular clergy as well as the\r\n                   monasteries; this was refused on the ground that it\r\n                   would have superseded the proper functions of the\r\n                   episcopate (_L. and P._, ii., 4399; iii., 149).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 321: _L. and P._, ii., 629, 2637, 4068.\r\n                   Lark became prebendary of St. Stephen's (_Ibid._,\r\n                   iv., _Introd._, p. xlvi.).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 322: Called Thomas Wynter, see the\r\n                   present writer's _Life of Cranmer_, p. 324 _n._\r\n                   Some writers have affected to doubt Wolsey's\r\n                   parentage of Wynter, but this son is often referred\r\n                   to in the correspondence of the time, _e.g._, _L. and\r\n                   P._, iv., p. 1407, Nos. 4824, 5581, 6026, 6075.\r\n                   Art. 27.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 323: _Ibid._, iii., 1284; iv., p. 2558;\r\n                   ii., 2930.]\r\n\r\nRepellent as was Wolsey's character in many respects, he was yet the\r\ngreatest, as he was the last, of the ecclesiastical statesmen who have\r\ngoverned England. As a diplomatist, pure and simple, he has never been\r\nsurpassed, and as an administrator he has had few equals. \"He is,\"\r\nsays Giustinian, \"very handsome, learned, extremely eloquent, of vast\r\nability and indefatigable. He alone transacts the same business as\r\nthat which occupies all the magistracies, offices, and councils of\r\nVenice, both civil and criminal; and all State affairs are managed by\r\nhim, let their nature be what it may. He is thoughtful, and has the\r\nreputation of being extremely just; he favours the people exceedingly,\r\nand especially the poor, hearing their suits and seeking to despatch\r\nthem instantly. He also makes the lawyers plead gratis for all poor\r\nsuitors. He is in very great repute, seven times more so than if   (p. 119)\r\nhe were Pope.\"[324] His sympathy with the poor was no idle sentiment,\r\nand his commission of 1517, and decree against enclosures in the\r\nfollowing year, were the only steps taken in Henry's reign to mitigate\r\nthat curse of the agricultural population.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 324: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1287; Giustinian,\r\n                   _D sp._, App. ii., 309; _L. and P._, iii., 402.]\r\n\r\nThe Evil May Day riots of 1517 alone disturbed the peace of Wolsey's\r\ninternal administration; and they were due merely to anti-foreign\r\nprejudice, and to the idea that strangers within the gates monopolised\r\nthe commerce of England and diverted its profits to their own advantage.\r\n\"Never,\" wrote Wolsey to a bishop at Rome in 1518, \"was the kingdom in\r\ngreater harmony and repose than now; such is the effect of my\r\nadministration of justice and equity.\"[325] To Henry his strain was\r\nless arrogant. \"And for your realm,\" he says, \"our Lord be thanked, it\r\nwas never in such peace nor tranquillity; for all this summer I have\r\nhad neither of riot, felony, nor forcible entry, but that your laws be\r\nin every place indifferently ministered without leaning of any manner.\r\nAlbeit, there hath lately been a fray betwixt Pygot, your Serjeant,\r\nand Sir Andrew Windsor's servants for the seisin of a ward, whereto\r\nthey both pretend titles; in the which one man was slain.

From the beginning there were frequent\r\nrumours of plots to depose him, and his enemies abroad often talked of\r\nthe universal hatred which he inspired in England. The classes which\r\nbenefited by his justice complained bitterly of the impositions\r\nrequired to support his spirited foreign policy. Clerics who regarded\r\nhim as a bulwark on the one hand against heresy, and, on the other,\r\nagainst the extreme view which Henry held from the first of his\r\nauthority over the Church, were alienated by the despotism Wolsey\r\nwielded by means of his legatine powers. Even the mild and aged Warham\r\nfelt his lash, and was threatened with _Praemunire_ for having wounded\r\nWolsey's legatine authority by calling a council at Lambeth.[328]\r\nPeers, spiritual no less than temporal, regarded him as \"the great\r\ntyrant\". Parliament he feared and distrusted; he had urged the speedy\r\ndissolution of that of 1515; only one sat during the fourteen years of\r\nhis supremacy, and with that the Cardinal quarrelled. He possessed no\r\nhold over the nation, but only over the King, in whom alone he put his\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 327: _L. and P._, App. No. 53; _cf._\r\n                   Leadam, _Domesday of Enclosures_ (Royal Hist.\r\n                   Soc.).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 328: _Ibid._, iii., 77, 98; _cf._ ii.,\r\n                   3973; iii. 1142.]\r\n\r\nFor the time he seemed secure enough. No one could touch a hair    (p. 121)\r\nof his head so long as he was shielded by Henry's power, and Henry\r\nseemed to have given over his royal authority to Wolsey's hands with a\r\nblind and undoubting confidence. \"The King,\" said one, in 1515, \"is a\r\nyoungling, cares for nothing but girls and hunting, and wastes his\r\nfather's patrimony.\"[329] \"He gambled,\" reported Giustinian in 1519,\r\n\"with the French hostages, occasionally, it was said, to the amount of\r\nsix or eight thousand ducats a day.\"[330] In the following summer\r\nHenry rose daily at four or five in the morning and hunted till nine\r\nor ten at night; \"he spares,\" said Pace, \"no pains to convert the\r\nsport of hunting into a martyrdom\".[331] \"He devotes himself,\" wrote\r\nChieregati, \"to accomplishments and amusements day and night, is\r\nintent on nothing else, and leaves business to Wolsey, who rules\r\neverything.\"[332] Wolsey, it was remarked by Leo X., made Henry go\r\nhither and thither, just as he liked,[333] and the King signed State\r\npapers without knowing their contents. \"Writing,\" admitted Henry, \"is\r\nto me somewhat tedious and painful.\"[334] When Wolsey thought it\r\nessential that autograph letters in Henry's hand should be sent to\r\nother crowned heads, he composed the letters and sent them to Henry to\r\ncopy out.[335] Could the most constitutional monarch have been more\r\ndutiful? But constitutional monarchy was not then invented, and it is\r\nnot surprising that Giustinian, in 1519, found it impossible to    (p. 122)\r\nsay much for Henry as a statesman. _Agere cum rege_, he said, _est\r\nnihil agere_;[336] anything told to the King was either useless or was\r\ncommunicated to Wolsey. Bishop West was sure that Henry would not take\r\nthe pains to look at his and Worcester's despatches; and there was a\r\nwidespread impression abroad and at home that the English King was a\r\nnegligible quantity in the domestic and foreign affairs of his own\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 329: _L. and P._, ii., 1105; _cf. ibid._,\r\n                   ii., 215.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 330: Giustinian, _Desp._, App. ii., 309.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 331: _L. and P._, iii., 950; _cf._ iii.,\r\n                   1160, where Fitzwilliam describes Henry as a\r\n                   \"master\" in deer-hunting.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 332: _Ven.

Cal._, ii., 1110.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor ten years Henry had reigned while first his council, and then\r\nWolsey, governed. Before another decade had passed, Henry was King and\r\nGovernment in one; and nobody in the kingdom counted for much but the\r\nKing. He stepped at once into Wolsey's place, became his own prime\r\nminister, and ruled with a vigour which was assuredly not less than\r\nthe Cardinal's. Such transformations are not the work of a moment, and\r\nHenry's would have been impossible, had he in previous years been so\r\ncompletely the slave of Vanity Fair, as most people thought. In\r\nreality, there are indications that beneath the superficial gaiety of\r\nhis life, Henry was beginning to use his own judgment, form his own\r\nconclusions, and take an interest in serious matters. He was only\r\ntwenty-eight in 1519, and his character was following a normal course\r\nof development.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest years of his reign Henry had at least two serious\r\npreoccupations, the New Learning and his navy. We learn from Erasmus\r\nthat Henry's Court was an example to Christendom for learning and\r\npiety;[337] that the King sought to promote learning among the clergy;\r\nand on one occasion defended \"mental and _ex tempore_ prayer\" against\r\nthose who apparently thought laymen should, in their private       (p. 123)\r\ndevotions, confine themselves to formularies prescribed by the\r\nclergy.[338] In 1519 there were more men of learning at the English\r\nCourt than at any university;[339] it was more like a museum, says the\r\ngreat humanist, than a Court;[340] and in the same year the King\r\nendeavoured to stop the outcry against Greek, raised by the reactionary\r\n\"Trojans\" at Oxford. \"You would say,\" continues Erasmus, \"that Henry\r\nwas a universal genius. He has never neglected his studies; and\r\nwhenever he has leisure from his political occupations, he reads, or\r\ndisputes--of which he is very fond--with remarkable courtesy and\r\nunruffled temper. He is more of a companion than a king. For these\r\nlittle trials of wit, he prepares himself by reading schoolmen,\r\nThomas, Scotus or Gabriel.\"[341] His theological studies were\r\nencouraged by Wolsey, possibly to divert the King's mind from an\r\nunwelcome interference in politics, and it was at the Cardinal's\r\ninstigation that Henry set to work on his famous book against\r\nLuther.[342] He seems to have begun it, or some similar treatise,\r\nwhich may afterwards have been adapted to Luther's particular case,\r\nbefore the end of the year in which the German reformer published his\r\noriginal theses. In September, 1517, Erasmus heard that Henry had\r\nreturned to his studies,[343] and, in the following June, Pace writes\r\nto Wolsey that, with respect to the commendations given by the\r\nCardinal to the King's book, though Henry does not think it worthy\r\nsuch great praise as it has had from him and from all other \"great\r\nlearned\" men, yet he says he is very glad to have \"noted in your   (p. 124)\r\ngrace's letters that his reasons be called inevitable, considering\r\nthat your grace was sometime his adversary herein and of contrary\r\nopinion\".[344] It is obvious that this \"book,\" whatever it may have\r\nbeen, was the fruit of Henry's own mind, and that he adopted a line of\r\nargument not entirely relished by Wolsey. But, if it was the book\r\nagainst Luther, it was laid aside and rewritten before it was given to\r\nthe world in its final form. Nothing more is heard of it for three\r\nyears. In April, 1521, Pace explains to Wolsey the delay in sending\r\nhim on some news-letters from Germany \"which his grace had not read\r\ntill this day after his dinner; and thus he commanded me to write unto\r\nyour grace, declaring he was otherwise occupied; _i.e., in scribendo\r\ncontra Lutherum,_ as I do conjecture\".[345] Nine days later Pace found\r\nthe King reading a new book of Luther's, \"which he dispraised\"; and he\r\ntook the opportunity to show Henry Leo's bull against the Reformer.\r\n\"His grace showed himself well contented with the coming of the same;\r\nhowbeit, as touching the publication thereof, he said he would have it\r\nwell examined and diligently looked to afore it were published.\"[346]\r\nEven in the height of his fervour against heresy, Henry was in no mood\r\nto abate one jot or one tittle of his royal authority in\r\necclesiastical matters.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 337: _L. and P._, ii., 4115.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 338: _L. and P._, iii., 226.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 339: _Ibid._, iii., 251.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 340: _Ibid._, ii., 4340.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 341: _Ibid._, iv., 5412; for the freedom\r\n                   with which Cranmer in later days debated with Henry\r\n                   see the present writer's _Cranmer_, p. 169.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 342: _Ibid._, iii., 1659, 1772.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 343: _Ibid._, ii., 3673.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 344: _L. and P._, ii., 4257.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 345: _Ibid._, iii., 1220.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 346: _Ibid._, 1233.]\r\n\r\nHis book was finished before 21st May, 1521, when the King wrote to\r\nLeo, saying that \"ever since he knew Luther's heresy in Germany, he\r\nhad made it his study how to extirpate it. He had called the learned\r\nof his kingdom to consider these errors and denounce them, and     (p. 125)\r\nexhort others to do the same. He had urged the Emperor and Electors,\r\nsince this pestilent fellow would not return to God, to extirpate him\r\nand his heretical books. He thought it right still further to testify\r\nhis zeal for the faith by his writings, that all might see he was\r\nready to defend the Church, not only with his arms, but with the\r\nresources of his mind. He dedicated therefore, to the Pope, the first\r\nofferings of his intellect and his little erudition.\"[347] The letter\r\nhad been preceded, on 12th May, by a holocaust of Luther's books in\r\nSt. Paul's Churchyard. Wolsey sat in state on a scaffold at St. Paul's\r\nCross, with the papal nuncio and the Archbishop of Canterbury at his\r\nfeet on the right, and the imperial ambassador and Tunstall, Bishop of\r\nLondon, at his feet on the left; and while the books were being\r\ndevoured by the flames, Fisher preached a sermon denouncing the errors\r\ncontained therein.[348] But it was July before the fair copy of\r\nHenry's book was ready for presentation to Leo; possibly the interval\r\nwas employed by learned men in polishing Henry's style, but the\r\nsubstance of the work was undoubtedly of Henry's authorship. Such is\r\nthe direct testimony of Erasmus, and there is no evidence to indicate\r\nthe collaboration of others.[349] Pace was then the most intimate of\r\nHenry's counsellors, and Pace, by his own confession, was not in the\r\nsecret. Nor is the book so remarkable as to preclude the possibility\r\nof Henry's authorship. Its arguments are respectable and give evidence\r\nof an intelligent and fairly extensive acquaintance with the writings\r\nof the fathers and schoolmen; but they reveal no profound depth of\r\ntheological learning nor genius for abstract speculation. It does  (p. 126)\r\nnot rank so high in the realm of theology, as do some of Henry's\r\ncompositions in that of music. In August it was sent to Leo, with\r\nverses composed by Wolsey and copied out in the royal hand.[350] In\r\nSeptember the English ambassador at Rome presented Leo his copy, bound\r\nin cloth of gold. The Pope read five leaves without interruption, and\r\nremarked that \"he would not have thought such a book should have come\r\nfrom the King's grace, who hath been occupied, necessarily, in other\r\nfeats, seeing that other men which hath occupied themselves in study\r\nall their lives cannot bring forth the like\".[351] On 2nd October it\r\nwas formally presented in a consistory of cardinals; and, on the 11th,\r\nLeo promulgated his bull conferring on Henry his coveted title, \"Fidei\r\nDefensor\".\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 347: _L. and P._, iii., 1297.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 348: _Ibid._, iii., 1273.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 349: F.M. Nichols, _Epistles of Erasmus_,\r\n                   p. 424; _L. and P._, iv., 5412.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 350: _L. and P._, iii., 1450.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 351: _Ibid._, iii., 1574, 1654, 1655,\r\n                   1659.]\r\n\r\nProud as he was of his scholastic achievement and its reward at the\r\nhands of the Pope, Henry was doing more for the future of England by\r\nhis attention to naval affairs than by his pursuit of high-sounding\r\ntitles. His intuitive perception of England's coming needs in this\r\nrespect is, perhaps, the most striking illustration of his political\r\nforesight. He has been described as the father of the British navy;\r\nand, had he not laid the foundations of England's naval power, his\r\ndaughter's victory over Spain and entrance on the path that led to\r\nempire would have been impossible. Under Henry, the navy was first\r\norganised as a permanent force; he founded the royal dockyards at\r\nWoolwich and Deptford, and the corporation of Trinity House;[352] he\r\nencouraged the planting of timber for shipbuilding, enacted laws   (p. 127)\r\nfacilitating inland navigation, dotted the coast with fortifications,\r\nand settled the constitution of the naval service upon a plan from\r\nwhich it has ever since steadily developed. He owed his inspiration to\r\nnone of his councillors, least of all to Wolsey, who had not the\r\nfaintest glimmering of the importance of securing England's naval\r\nsupremacy, and who, during the war of 1522-23, preferred futile\r\ninvasions on land to Henry's \"secret designs\" for destroying the navy\r\nof France.[353] The King's interest in ships and shipbuilding was\r\nstrong, even amid the alluring diversions of the first years of his\r\nreign. He watched his fleet sail for Guienne in 1512, and for France\r\nin 1513; he knew the speed, the tonnage and the armament of every ship\r\nin his navy; he supervised the minutest details of their construction.\r\nIn 1520 his ambassador at Paris tells him that Francis is building a\r\nship, \"and reasoneth in this mystery of shipman's craft as one which\r\nhad understanding in the same. But, sir, he approacheth not your\r\nhighness in that science.\"[354] A French envoy records how, in 1515,\r\nthe whole English Court went down to see the launch of the _Princess\r\nMary_. Henry himself \"acted as pilot and wore a sailor's coat and\r\ntrousers, made of cloth of gold, and a gold chain with the inscription,\r\n'Dieu _est_ mon droit,' to which was suspended a whistle, which he\r\nblew nearly as loud as a trumpet\".[355] The launch of a ship was then\r\nalmost a religious ceremony, and the place of the modern bottle of\r\nchampagne was taken by a mass, which was said by the Bishop of Durham.\r\nIn 1518 Giustinian tells how Henry went to Southampton to see the\r\nVenetian galleys, and caused some new guns to be \"fired again and  (p. 128)\r\nagain, marking their range, as he is very curious about matters of\r\nthis kind\".[356]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 352: _Ibid._, i., 3807. In 1513 an\r\n                   English consul was appointed at Scio (_ibid._, i.,\r\n                   3854).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 353: _L. and P._, iii., 1440; _cf.\r\n                   ibid._, 2421.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 354: _Ibid._, iii., 748.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 355: _Ibid._, ii., 1113.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 356: _L. and P._, ii., 4232.]\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Henry developed an active participation in\r\nserious matters other than theological disputes and naval affairs. It\r\nis not possible to trace its growth with any clearness because no\r\nrecord remains of the verbal communications which were sufficient to\r\nindicate his will during the constant attendance of Wolsey upon him.\r\nBut, as soon as monarch and minister were for some cause or another\r\napart, evidence of Henry's activity in political matters becomes more\r\navailable. Thus, in 1515, we find Wolsey sending the King, at his own\r\nrequest, the Act of Apparel, just passed by Parliament, for Henry's\r\n\"examination and correction\".[357] He also desires Henry's determination\r\nabout the visit of the Queen of Scotland, that he may make the\r\nnecessary arrangements. In 1518 Henry made a prolonged stay at\r\nAbingdon, partly from fear of the plague, and partly, as he told Pace,\r\nbecause at Abingdon people were not continually coming to tell him of\r\ndeaths, as they did daily in London. During this absence from London,\r\nHenry insisted upon the attendance of sufficient councillors to enable\r\nhim to transact business; he established a relay of posts every seven\r\nhours between himself and Wolsey; and we hear of his reading \"every\r\nword of all the letters\" sent by his minister.[358] Every week Wolsey\r\ndespatched an account of such State business as he had transacted; and\r\non one occasion, \"considering the importance of Wolsey's letters,\"\r\nHenry paid a secret and flying visit to London.[359] In 1519 there\r\nwas a sort of revolution at Court, obscure enough now, but then a  (p. 129)\r\nsubject of some comment at home and abroad. Half a dozen of Henry's\r\ncourtiers were removed from his person and sent into honourable exile,\r\nreceiving posts at Calais, at Guisnes, and elsewhere.[360] Giustinian\r\nthought that Henry had been gambling too much and wished to turn over\r\na new leaf. There were also rumours that these courtiers governed\r\nHenry after their own appetite, to the King's dishonour; and Henry,\r\nannoyed at the report and jealous as ever of royal prestige, promptly\r\ncashiered them, and filled their places with grave and reverend\r\nseniors.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 357: _Ibid._, ii., 1223.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 358: _Ibid._, ii., 4060, 4061, 4089.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 359: _L. and P._, ii., 4276.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 360: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1220, 1230; _L.\r\n                   and P._, iii., 246, 247, 249, 250. Francis I.\r\n                   thought they were dismissed as being too favourable\r\n                   to him, and as a rule the younger courtiers\r\n                   favoured France and the older Spain.]\r\n\r\nTwo years later Wolsey was abroad at the conference of Calais, and\r\nagain Henry's hand in State affairs becomes apparent. Pace, defending\r\nhimself from the Cardinal's complaints, tells him that he had done\r\neverything \"by the King's express commandment, who readeth all your\r\nletters with great diligence\". One of the letters which angered Wolsey\r\nwas the King's, for Pace \"had devised it very different\"; but the King\r\nwould not approve of it; \"and commanded me to bring your said letters\r\ninto his privy chamber with pen and ink, and there he would declare\r\nunto me what I should write. And when his grace had your said letters,\r\nhe read the same three times, and marked such places as it pleased him\r\nto make answer unto, and commanded me to write and rehearse as liked\r\nhim, and not further to meddle with that answer; so that I herein\r\nnothing did but obeyed the King's commandment, and especially at   (p. 130)\r\nsuch time _as he would upon good grounds be obeyed, whosoever spake to\r\nthe contrary_.\"[361] Wolsey might say in his pride \"I shall do so and\r\nso,\" and foreign envoys might think that the Cardinal made the King\r\n\"go hither and thither, just as he liked\"; but Wolsey knew perfectly\r\nwell that when he thought fit, Henry \"would be obeyed, whosoever spake\r\nto the contrary\". He might delegate much of his authority, but men\r\nwere under no misapprehension that he could and would revoke it\r\nwhenever he chose. For the time being, King and Cardinal worked\r\ntogether in general harmony, but it was a partnership in which Henry\r\ncould always have the last word, though Wolsey did most of the work.\r\nAs early as 1518 he had nominated Standish to the bishopric of St.\r\nAsaph, disregarding Wolsey's candidate and the opposition of the\r\nclerical party at Court, who detested Standish for his advocacy of\r\nHenry's authority in ecclesiastical matters, and dreaded his promotion\r\nas an evil omen for the independence of the Church.[362]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 361: _L. and P._, iii., 1713.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 362: _Ibid._, ii., 4074, 4083, 4089.]\r\n\r\nEven in the details of administration, the King was becoming\r\nincreasingly vigilant. In 1519 he drew up a \"remembrance of such\r\nthings\" as he required the Cardinal to \"put in effectual\r\nexecution\".[363] They were twenty-one in number and ranged over every\r\nvariety of subject. The household was to be arranged; \"views to be\r\nmade and books kept\"; the ordnance seen to; treasurers were to make\r\nmonthly reports of their receipts and payments, and send counterparts\r\nto the King; the surveyor of lands was to make a yearly declaration;\r\nand Wolsey himself and the judges were to make quarterly reports   (p. 131)\r\nto Henry in person. There were five points \"which the King will debate\r\nwith his council,\" the administration of justice, reform of the\r\nexchequer, Ireland, employment of idle people, and maintenance of the\r\nfrontiers. The general plan of Wolsey's negotiations at Calais in 1521\r\nwas determined by King and Cardinal in consultation, and every\r\nimportant detail in them and in the subsequent preparations for war\r\nwas submitted to Henry. Not infrequently they differed. Wolsey wanted\r\nSir William Sandys to command the English contingent; Henry declared\r\nit would be inconsistent with his dignity to send a force out of the\r\nrealm under the command of any one of lower rank than an earl. Wolsey\r\nreplied that Sandys would be cheaper than an earl,[364] but the\r\ncommand was entrusted to the Earl of Surrey. Henry thought it unsafe,\r\nconsidering the imminence of a breach with France, for English wine\r\nships to resort to Bordeaux; Wolsey thought otherwise, and they\r\ndisputed the point for a month. Honours were divided; the question was\r\nsettled for the time by twenty ships sailing while the dispute was in\r\nprogress.[365] Apparently they returned in safety, but the seizure of\r\nEnglish ships at Bordeaux in the following March justified Henry's\r\ncaution.[366] The King was already an adept in statecraft, and there\r\nwas at least an element of truth in the praise which Wolsey bestowed\r\non his pupil. \"No man,\" he wrote, \"can more groundly consider the\r\npolitic governance of your said realm, nor more assuredly look to the\r\npreservation thereof, than ye yourself.\" And again, \"surely, if all\r\n_your_ whole council had been assembled together, they could not   (p. 132)\r\nhave more deeply perceived or spoken therein\".[367]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 363: _Ibid._, iii., 576.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 364: _L. and P._, iii., 1454, 1473,\r\n                   1474.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 365: _Ibid._, iii., 1629, 1630.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 366: _Ibid._, iii., 2224.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 367: _L. and P._, iii., 1544, 1762.]\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal \"could not express the joy and comfort with which he\r\nnoted the King's prudence\"; but he can scarcely have viewed Henry's\r\ngrowing interference without some secret misgivings. For he was\r\ndeveloping not only Wolsey's skill and lack of scruple in politics,\r\nbut also a choleric and impatient temper akin to the Cardinal's own.\r\nIn 1514 Carroz had complained of Henry's offensive behaviour, and had\r\nurged that it would become impossible to control him, if the \"young\r\ncolt\" were not bridled. In the following year Henry treated a French\r\nenvoy with scant civility, and flatly contradicted him twice as he\r\ndescribed the battle of Marignano. Giustinian also records how Henry\r\nwent \"pale with anger\" at unpleasant news.[368] A few years later his\r\nsuccessor describes Henry's \"very great rage\" when detailing Francis's\r\ninjuries; Charles made the same complaints against the French King,\r\n\"but not so angrily, in accordance with his gentler nature\".[369] On\r\nanother occasion Henry turned his back upon a diplomatist and walked\r\naway in the middle of his speech, an incident, we are told, on which\r\nmuch comment was made in Rome.[370]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 368: _Ibid._, ii., 1113, 1653.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 369: _Ven.

Cal._, ii., 314.]\r\n\r\nBut these outbursts were rare and they grew rarer; in 1527 Mendoza,\r\nthe Spanish ambassador, remarks that it was \"quite the reverse of the\r\nKing's ordinary manner\" to be more violent than Wolsey;[371] and\r\nthroughout the period of strained relations with the Emperor, Chapuys\r\nconstantly refers to the unfailing courtesy and graciousness with  (p. 133)\r\nwhich Henry received him. He never forgot himself so far as to lay\r\nrude hands on an ambassador, as Wolsey did; and no provocation betrayed\r\nhim in his later years, passionate though he was, into a neglect of\r\nthe outward amenities of diplomatic and official intercourse. Outbursts\r\nof anger, of course, there were; but they were often like the explosions\r\nof counsel in law courts, and were \"to a great extent diplomatically\r\ncontrolled\".[372] Nor can we deny the consideration with which Henry\r\nhabitually treated his councillors, the wide discretion he allowed\r\nthem in the exercise of their duties, and the toleration he extended\r\nto contrary opinions. He was never impatient of advice even when it\r\nconflicted with his own views. His long arguments with Wolsey, and the\r\nfreedom with which the Cardinal justified his recommendations, even\r\nafter Henry had made up his mind to an opposite course, are a\r\nsufficient proof of the fact. In 1517, angered by Maximilian's\r\nperfidy, Henry wrote him some very \"displeasant\" letters. Tunstall\r\nthought they would do harm, kept them back, and received no censure\r\nfor his conduct. In 1522-23 Wolsey advised first the siege of Boulogne\r\nand then its abandonment. \"The King,\" wrote More, \"is by no means\r\ndispleased that you have changed your opinion, as his highness\r\nesteemeth nothing in counsel more perilous than one to persevere in\r\nthe maintenance of his advice because he hath once given it. He\r\ntherefore commendeth and most affectuously thanketh your faithful\r\ndiligence and high wisdom in advertising him of the reasons which have\r\nmoved you to change your opinion.\"[373] No king knew better than Henry\r\nhow to get good work from his ministers, and his warning against   (p. 134)\r\npersevering in advice, merely because it has once been given, is a\r\npolitical maxim for all time.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 371: _Ibid._, iii., 109.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 372: _L. and P._, xiii., p. xli.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 373: _Ibid._, iii., 2421, 3346.]\r\n\r\nA lesson might also be learnt from a story of Henry and Colet told by\r\nErasmus on Colet's own authority.[374] In 1513 war fever raged in\r\nEngland. Colet's bishop summoned him \"into the King's Court for\r\nasserting, when England was preparing for war against France, that an\r\nunjust peace was preferable to the most just war; but the King threatened\r\nhis persecutor with vengeance. After Easter, when the expedition was\r\nready against France, Colet preached on Whitsunday before the King and\r\nthe Court, exhorting men rather to follow the example of Christ their\r\nprince than that of Caesar and Alexander. The King was afraid that this\r\nsermon would have an ill effect upon the soldiers and sent for the\r\nDean. Colet happened to be dining at the Franciscan monastery near\r\nGreenwich. When the King heard of it, he entered the garden of the\r\nmonastery, and on Colet's appearance dismissed his attendants; then\r\ndiscussed the matter with him, desiring him to explain himself, lest\r\nhis audience should suppose that no war was justifiable. After the\r\nconversation was over he dismissed him before them all, drinking to\r\nColet's health and saying 'Let every man have his own doctor, this is\r\nmine'.\" The picture is pleasing evidence of Henry's superiority to\r\nsome vulgar passions. Another instance of freedom from popular prejudice,\r\nwhich he shared with his father, was his encouragement of foreign\r\nscholars, diplomatists and merchants; not a few of the ablest of Tudor\r\nagents were of alien birth. He was therefore intensely annoyed at the\r\nrabid fury against them that broke out in the riots of Evil May Day;\r\nyet he pardoned all the ringleaders but one. Tolerance and         (p. 135)\r\nclemency were no small part of his character in early manhood;[375]\r\nand together with his other mental and physical graces, his love of\r\nlearning and of the society of learned men, his magnificence and\r\ndisplay, his supremacy in all the sports that were then considered the\r\npeculiar adornment of royalty, they contributed scarcely less than\r\nWolsey's genius for diplomacy and administration to England's renown.\r\n\"In short,\" wrote Chieregati to Isabella d'Este in 1517, \"the wealth\r\nand civilisation of the world are here; and those who call the English\r\nbarbarians appear to me to render themselves such. I here perceive\r\nvery elegant manners, extreme decorum, and very great politeness. And\r\namongst other things there is this most invincible King, whose\r\naccomplishments and qualities are so many and excellent that I\r\nconsider him to surpass all who ever wore a crown; and blessed and\r\nhappy may this country call itself in having as its lord so worthy and\r\neminent a sovereign; whose sway is more bland and gentle than the\r\ngreatest liberty under any other.\"[376]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 374: _L. and P._, iii., 303.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 375: For the extraordinary freedom of\r\n                   speech which Henry permitted, see _L. and P._,\r\n                   xii., ii., 952, where Sir George Throckmorton\r\n                   relates how he accused Henry to his face of immoral\r\n                   relations with Mary Boleyn and her mother.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 376: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 918.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.                                                        (p. 136)\r\n\r\nFROM CALAIS TO ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wonderful success that had attended Wolsey's policy during his\r\nseven years' tenure of power, and the influential position to which he\r\nhad raised England in the councils of Christendom, might well have\r\ndisturbed the mental balance of a more modest and diffident man than\r\nthe Cardinal; and it is scarcely surprising that he fancied himself,\r\nand sought to become, arbiter of the destinies of Europe. The condition\r\nof continental politics made his ambition seem less than extravagant.\r\nPower was almost monopolised by two young princes whose rivalry was\r\nkeen, whose resources were not altogether unevenly matched, and whose\r\ndisputes were so many and serious that war could only be averted by a\r\npacific determination on both sides which neither possessed. Francis\r\nhad claims on Naples, and his dependant, D'Albret, on Navarre. Charles\r\nhad suzerain rights over Milan and a title to Burgundy, of which his\r\ngreat-grandfather Charles the Bold had been despoiled by Louis XI. Yet\r\nthe Emperor had not the slightest intention of compromising his\r\npossession of Naples or Navarre, and Francis was quite as resolute to\r\nsurrender neither Burgundy nor Milan. They both became eager competitors\r\nfor the friendship of England, which, if its resources were inadequate\r\nto support the position of arbiter, was at least a most useful     (p. 137)\r\nmakeweight. England's choice of policy was, however, strictly limited.\r\nShe could not make war upon Charles. It was not merely that Charles\r\nhad a staunch ally in his aunt Catherine of Aragon, who is said to\r\nhave \"made such representations and shown such reasons against\" the\r\nalliance with Francis \"as one would not have supposed she would have\r\ndared to do, or even to imagine\".[377] It was not merely that in this\r\nmatter Catherine was backed by the whole council except Wolsey, and by\r\nthe real inclinations of the King. It was that the English people were\r\nfirmly imperialist in sympathy. The reason was obvious. Charles\r\ncontrolled the wool-market of the Netherlands, and among English\r\nexports wool was all-important. War with Charles meant the ruin of\r\nEngland's export trade, the starvation or impoverishment of thousands\r\nof Englishmen; and when war was declared against Charles eight years\r\nlater, it more nearly cost Henry his throne than all the fulminations\r\nof the Pope or religious discontents, and after three months it was\r\nbrought to a summary end. England remained at peace with Spain so long\r\nas Spain controlled its market for wool; when that market passed into\r\nthe hands of the revolted Netherlands, the same motive dictated an\r\nalliance with the Dutch against Philip II. War with Charles in 1520\r\nwas out of the question; and for the next two years Wolsey and Henry\r\nwere endeavouring to make Francis and the Emperor bid against each\r\nother, in order that England might obtain the maximum of concession\r\nfrom Charles when it should declare in his favour, as all along    (p. 138)\r\nwas intended.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 377: _L. and P._, iii., 728. Wolsey's\r\n                   opposition is attributed by the imperial ambassador\r\n                   to Francis I.'s promise to make him Pope, \"which we\r\n                   might have done much better\".]\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of London Henry was bound to assist the aggrieved\r\nagainst the aggressor. But that treaty had been concluded between\r\nEngland and France in the first instance; Henry's only daughter was\r\nbetrothed to the Dauphin; and Francis was anxious to cement his\r\nalliance with Henry by a personal interview.[378] It was Henry's\r\npolicy to play the friend for the time; and, as a proof of his desire\r\nfor the meeting with Francis, he announced, in August, 1519, his\r\nresolve to wear his beard until the meeting took place.[379] He\r\nreckoned without his wife. On 8th November Louise of Savoy, the\r\nqueen-mother of France, taxed Boleyn, the English ambassador, with a\r\nreport that Henry had put off his beard. \"I said,\" writes Boleyn,\r\n\"that, as I suppose, it hath been by the Queen's desire; for I told my\r\nlady that I have hereafore time known when the King's grace hath worn\r\nlong his beard, that the Queen hath daily made him great instance, and\r\ndesired him to put it off for her sake.\"[380] Henry's inconstancy in\r\nthe matter of his beard not only caused diplomatic inconvenience, but,\r\nit may be parenthetically remarked, adds to the difficulty of dating\r\nhis portraits. Francis, however, considered the Queen's interference a\r\nsufficient excuse, or was not inclined to stick at such trifles; and\r\non 10th January, 1520, he nominated Wolsey his proctor to make\r\narrangements for the interview.[381] As Wolsey was also agent for\r\nHenry, the French King saw no further cause for delay.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 378: The interview had been agreed upon\r\n                   as early as October, 1518, when it was proposed\r\n                   that it should take place before the end of July,\r\n                   1519 (_L. and P._, ii., 4483).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 379: _Ibid._, iii., 416.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 380: _Ibid._, iii., 514.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 381: _Ibid._, iii., 592.]\r\n\r\nThe delay came from England; the meeting with Francis would be a   (p. 139)\r\none-sided pronouncement without some corresponding favour to Charles.\r\nSome time before Henry had sent Charles a pressing invitation to visit\r\nEngland on his way from Spain to Germany; and the Emperor, suspicious\r\nof the meeting between Henry and Francis, was only too anxious to come\r\nand forestall it. The experienced Margaret of Savoy admitted that\r\nHenry's friendship was essential to Charles;[382] but Spaniards were\r\nnot to be hurried, and it would be May before the Emperor's convoy was\r\nready. So Henry endeavoured to postpone his engagement with Francis.\r\nThe French King replied that by the end of May his Queen would be in\r\nthe eighth month of her pregnancy, and that if the meeting were\r\nfurther prorogued she must perforce be absent.[383] Henry was nothing\r\nif not gallant, at least on the surface. Francis's argument clinched\r\nthe matter. The interview, ungraced by the presence of France's Queen,\r\nwould, said Henry, be robbed of most of its charm;[384] and he gave\r\nCharles to understand that, unless he reached England by the middle of\r\nMay, his visit would have to be cancelled. This intimation produced an\r\nunwonted despatch in the Emperor's movements; but fate was against\r\nhim, and contrary winds rendered his arrival in time a matter of doubt\r\ntill the last possible moment. Henry must cross to Calais on the 31st\r\nof May, whether Charles came or not; and it was the 26th before the\r\nEmperor's ships appeared off the cliffs of Dover. Wolsey put out in a\r\nsmall boat to meet him, and conducted Charles to the castle where he\r\nlodged. During the night Henry arrived. Early next day, which was  (p. 140)\r\nWhitsunday, the two sovereigns proceeded to Canterbury, where the\r\nQueen and Court had come on the way to France to spend their Pentecost.\r\nFive days the Emperor remained with his aunt, whom he now saw for the\r\nfirst time; but the days were devoted to business rather than to\r\nelaborate ceremonial and show, for which there had been little time to\r\nprepare.[385]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 382: _L. and P._, iii., 672; _cf._ iii.,\r\n                   742.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 383: _Ibid._, iii., 681, 725.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 384: _Ibid._, iii., 697.]\r\n\r\nOn the last day of May Charles took ship at Sandwich for Flanders.\r\nHenry embarked at Dover for France. The painting at Hampton Court\r\ndepicting the scene has, like almost every other picture of Henry's\r\nreign, been ascribed to Holbein; but six years were to pass before the\r\ngreat artist visited England. The King himself is represented as being\r\non board the four-masted _Henry Grace a Dieu_, commonly called the\r\n_Great Harry_, the finest ship afloat; though the vessel originally\r\nfitted out for his passage was the _Katherine Pleasaunce_.[386] At\r\neleven o'clock he landed at Calais. On Monday, the 4th of June, Henry\r\nand all his Court proceeded to Guisnes. There a temporary palace of\r\nart had been erected, the splendour of which is inadequately set forth\r\nin pages upon pages of contemporary descriptions. One Italian likened\r\nit to the palaces described in Boiardo's _Orlando Innamorato_ and\r\nAriosto's _Orlando Furioso_; another declared that it could not have\r\nbeen better designed by Leonardo da Vinci himself.[387] Everything\r\nwas in harmony with this architectural pomp. Wolsey was            (p. 141)\r\naccompanied, it was said in Paris, by two hundred gentlemen clad in\r\ncrimson velvet, and had a body-guard of two hundred archers. He was\r\nhimself clothed in crimson satin from head to foot, his mule was\r\ncovered with crimson velvet, and her trappings were all of gold.\r\nHenry, \"the most goodliest prince that ever reigned over the realm of\r\nEngland,\" appeared even to Frenchmen as a very handsome prince,\r\n\"honnete, hault et droit,\"[388] in manner gentle and gracious, rather\r\nfat, and--in spite of his Queen--with a red beard, large enough and\r\nvery becoming. Another eye-witness adds the curious remark that, while\r\nFrancis was the taller of the two, Henry had the handsomer and more\r\n_feminine_ face![389] On the 7th of June the two Kings started\r\nsimultaneously from Guisnes and Ardres for their personal meeting in\r\nthe valley mid-way between the two towns, already known as the Val\r\nDore. The obscure but familiar phrase, Field of Cloth of Gold,[390] is\r\na mistranslation of the French Camp du Drap d'Or. As they came in\r\nsight a temporary suspicion of French designs seized the English, but\r\nit was overcome. Henry and Francis rode forward alone, embraced each\r\nother first on horseback and then again on foot, and made show of\r\nbeing the closest friends in Christendom. On Sunday the 10th Henry\r\ndined with the French Queen, and Francis with Catherine of Aragon. The\r\nfollowing week was devoted to tourneys, which the two Kings opened by\r\nholding the field against all comers. The official accounts are\r\nnaturally silent on the royal wrestling match, recorded in French  (p. 142)\r\nmemoirs and histories.[391] On the 17th Francis, as a final effort to\r\nwin Henry's alliance, paid a surprise visit to him at breakfast with\r\nonly four attendants. The jousts were concluded with a solemn mass\r\nsaid by Wolsey in a chapel built on the field. The Cardinal of Bourbon\r\npresented the Gospel to Francis to kiss; he refused, offering it to\r\nHenry who was too polite to accept the honour. The same respect for\r\neach other's dignity was observed with the _Pax_, and the two Queens\r\nbehaved with a similarly courteous punctilio. After a friendly dispute\r\nas to who should kiss the _Pax_ first, they kissed each other\r\ninstead.[392] On the 24th Henry and Francis met to interchange gifts,\r\nto make their final professions of friendship, and to bid each other\r\nadieu. Francis set out for Abbeville, and Henry returned to Calais.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 385: _Ven. Cal._, iii., 50; _Sp.

They adapt themselves to circumstances, but they\r\nhate each other very cordially.\"[393] Beneath the profusion of friendly\r\npretences lay rooted suspicions and even deliberate hostile intentions.\r\nBefore Henry left England the rumour of ships fitting out in French\r\nports had stopped preparations for the interview; and they were not\r\nresumed till a promise under the broad seal of France was given that\r\nno French ship should sail before Henry's return.[394] On the eve of\r\nthe meeting Henry is said to have discovered that three or four thousand\r\nFrench troops were concealed in the neighbouring country;[395]     (p. 143)\r\nhe insisted on their removal, and Francis's unguarded visit to Henry\r\nwas probably designed to disarm the English distrust.[396] No sooner\r\nwas Henry's back turned than the French began the fortification of\r\nArdres,[397] while Henry on his part went to Calais to negotiate a\r\nless showy but genuine friendship with Charles. No such magnificence\r\nadorned their meeting as had been displayed at the Field of Cloth of\r\nGold, but its solid results were far more lasting. On 10th July Henry\r\nrode to Gravelines where the Emperor was waiting. On the 11th they\r\nreturned together to Calais, where during a three days' visit the\r\nnegotiations begun at Canterbury were completed. The ostensible\r\npurport of the treaty signed on the 14th was to bind Henry to proceed\r\nno further in the marriage between the Princess Mary and the Dauphin,\r\nand Charles no further in that between himself and Francis's daughter,\r\nCharlotte.[398] But more topics were discussed than appeared on the\r\nsurface; and among them was a proposal to marry Mary to the Emperor\r\nhimself.[399] The design proves that Henry and Wolsey had already made\r\nup their minds to side with Charles, whenever his disputes with\r\nFrancis should develop into open hostilities.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 393: _Ven. Cal._, iii., 119.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 394: _L. and P._, iii., 836, 842, 843.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 395: _Ven. Cal._, iii., 80.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 396: _Ibid._, iii., 90.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 397: _Ibid._, iii., 121.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 398: _L. and P._, iii., 914.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 399: _Ibid._, iii., 1149, 1150.]\r\n\r\nThat consummation could not be far off. Charles had scarcely turned\r\nhis back upon Spain when murmurs of disaffection were heard through\r\nthe length and breadth of the land; and while he was discussing with\r\nHenry at Calais the prospects of a war with France, his commons in\r\nSpain broke out into open revolt.[400] The rising had attained     (p. 144)\r\nsuch dimensions by February, 1521, that Henry thought Charles was\r\nlikely to lose his Spanish dominions. The temptation was too great for\r\nFrance to resist; and in the early spring of 1521 French forces\r\noverran Navarre, and restored to his kingdom the exile D'Albret.\r\nFrancis had many plausible excuses, and sought to prove that he was\r\nnot really the aggressor. There had been confused fighting between the\r\nimperialist Nassau and Francis's allies, the Duke of Guelders and\r\nRobert de la Marck, which the imperialists may have begun. But Francis\r\nrevealed his true motive, when he told Fitzwilliam that he had many\r\ngrievances against Charles and could not afford to neglect this\r\nopportunity for taking his revenge.[401]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 400: _Ibid._, iii., 883, 891, 964, 976,\r\n                   988, 994.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 401: _L. and P._, iii., 1303, 1310,\r\n                   1315.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWar between Emperor and King soon spread from Navarre to the borders\r\nof Flanders and to the plains of Northern Italy. Both sovereigns\r\nclaimed the assistance of England in virtue of the Treaty of London.\r\nBut Henry would not be prepared for war till the following year at\r\nleast; and he proposed that Wolsey should go to Calais to mediate\r\nbetween the two parties and decide which had been the aggressor.\r\nCharles, either because he was unprepared or was sure of Wolsey's\r\nsupport, readily agreed; but Francis was more reluctant, and only the\r\nknowledge that, if he refused, Henry would at once side with Charles,\r\ninduced him to consent to the conference. So on 2nd August, 1521, the\r\nCardinal again crossed the Channel.[402] His first interview was with\r\nthe imperial envoys.[403] They announced that Charles had given them\r\nno power to treat for a truce. Wolsey refused to proceed without this\r\nauthority; and he obtained the consent of the French chancellor,   (p. 145)\r\nDu Prat, to his proposal to visit the Emperor at Bruges, and secure\r\nthe requisite powers. He was absent more than a fortnight, and not\r\nlong after his return fell ill. This served to pass time in September,\r\nand the extravagant demands of both parties still further prolonged\r\nthe proceedings. Wolsey was constrained to tell them the story of a\r\ncourtier who asked his King for the grant of a forest; when his\r\nrelatives denounced his presumption, he replied that he only wanted in\r\nreality eight or nine trees.[404] The French and imperial chancellors\r\nnot merely demanded their respective forests, but made the reduction\r\nof each single tree a matter of lengthy dispute; and as soon as a\r\nfresh success in the varying fortune of war was reported, they\r\nreturned to their early pretensions. Wolsey was playing his game with\r\nconsummate skill; delay was his only desire; his illness had been\r\ndiplomatic; his objects were to postpone for a few months the breach\r\nand to secure the pensions from France due at the end of October.[405]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 402: See his various and ample\r\n                   commissions, _ibid._, iii., 1443.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 403: _Ibid._, iii., 1462.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 404: _L. and P._, iii., 1622.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 405: _Ibid._, iii., 1507. \"The Cardinal\r\n                   apologised for not having met them so long on\r\n                   account of his illness, but said he could not\r\n                   otherwise have gained so much time without causing\r\n                   suspicion to the French\" (Gattinara to Charles V.,\r\n                   24th September, 1521, _ibid._, iii., 1605).]\r\n\r\nThe conference at Calais was in fact a monument of perfidy worthy of\r\nFerdinand the Catholic. The plan was Wolsey's, but Henry had expressed\r\nfull approval. As early as July the King was full of his secret design\r\nfor destroying the navy of France, though he did not propose to proceed\r\nwith the enterprise till Wolsey had completed the arrangements with\r\nCharles.[406] The subterfuge about Charles refusing his powers     (p. 146)\r\nand the Cardinal's journey to Bruges had been arranged between Henry,\r\nWolsey and Charles before Wolsey left England. The object of that\r\nvisit, so far from being to facilitate an agreement, was to conclude\r\nan offensive and defensive alliance against one of the two parties\r\nbetween whom Wolsey was pretending to mediate. \"Henry agrees,\" wrote\r\nCharles's ambassador on 6th July, \"with Wolsey's plan that he should\r\nbe sent to Calais under colour of hearing the grievances of both\r\nparties: and when he cannot arrange them, he should withdraw to the\r\nEmperor to treat of the matters aforesaid\".[407] The treaty was\r\nconcluded at Bruges on 25th August[408] before he returned to Calais;\r\nthe Emperor promised Wolsey the Papacy;[409] the details of a joint\r\ninvasion were settled. Charles was to marry Mary; and the Pope was to\r\ndispense the two from the disability of their kinship, and from\r\nengagements with others which both had contracted. The Cardinal might\r\nbe profuse in his protestations of friendship for France, of devotion\r\nto peace, and of his determination to do justice to the parties before\r\nhim. But all his painted words could not long conceal the fact that\r\nbehind the mask of the judge were hidden the features of a conspirator.\r\nIt was an unpleasant time for Fitzwilliam, the English ambassador at\r\nthe French Court. The King's sister, Marguerite de Valois, taxed\r\nFitzwilliam with Wolsey's proceedings, hinting that deceit was being\r\npractised on Francis. The ambassador grew hot, vowed Henry was     (p. 147)\r\nnot a dissembler, and that he would prove it on any gentleman who\r\ndared to maintain that he was.[410] But he knew nothing of Wolsey's\r\nintrigues; nor was the Cardinal, to whom Fitzwilliam denounced the\r\ninsinuation, likely to blush, though he knew that the charge was true.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 406: _Ibid._, iii., 1440.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 407: _L. and P._, iii., 1395, 1433; _cf._\r\n                   iii., 1574, where Henry VIII.'s envoy tells Leo X.\r\n                   that the real object of the conference was to gain\r\n                   time for English preparations.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 408: _Ibid._, iii., 1508; _Cotton MS_.,\r\n                   Galba, B, vii., 102; see also an account of the\r\n                   conference in _L. and P._, iii., 1816, 1817.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 409: _Ibid._, iii., 1868, 1876.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 410: _L. and P._, iii., 1581.]\r\n\r\nWolsey returned from Calais at the end of November, having failed to\r\nestablish the truce to which the negotiations had latterly been in\r\nappearance directed. But the French half-yearly pensions were paid,\r\nand England had the winter in which to prepare for war. No attempt had\r\nbeen made to examine impartially the mutual charges of aggression\r\nurged by the litigants, though a determination of that point could\r\nalone justify England's intervention. The dispute was complicated\r\nenough. If, as Charles contended, the Treaty of London guaranteed the\r\n_status quo_, Francis, by invading Navarre, was undoubtedly the\r\noffender. But the French King pleaded the Treaty of Noyon, by which\r\nCharles had bound himself to do justice to the exiled King of Navarre,\r\nto marry the French King's daughter, and to pay tribute for Naples.\r\nThat treaty was not abrogated by the one concluded in London, yet\r\nCharles had fulfilled none of his promises. Moreover, the Emperor\r\nhimself had, long before the invasion of Navarre, been planning a war\r\nwith France, and negotiating with Leo to expel the French from Milan,\r\nand to destroy the predominant French faction in Genoa.[411] His   (p. 148)\r\nministers were making little secret of Charles's warlike intentions,\r\nwhen the Spanish revolt placed irresistible temptation in Francis's\r\nway, and provoked that attack on Navarre, which enabled Charles to\r\nplead, with some colour, that he was not the aggressor. This was the\r\nground alleged by Henry for siding with Charles, but it was not his\r\nreal reason for going to war. Nearly a year before Navarre was\r\ninvaded, he had discussed the rupture of Mary's engagement with the\r\nDauphin and the transference of her hand to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 411: In July, 1521, Gattinara drew out\r\n                   seven reasons for peace and ten for war; the former\r\n                   he playfully termed the seven deadly sins, and the\r\n                   latter the ten commandments (_L. and P._, iii.,\r\n                   1446; _Sp. Cal._, ii., 337).]\r\n\r\nThe real motives of England's policy do not appear on the surface.\r\n\"The aim of the King of England,\" said Clement VII. in 1524,[412] \"is\r\nas incomprehensible as the causes by which he is moved are futile. He\r\nmay, perhaps, wish to revenge himself for the slights he has received\r\nfrom the King of France and from the Scots, or to punish the King of\r\nFrance for his disparaging language; or, seduced by the flattery of\r\nthe Emperor, he may have nothing else in view than to help the\r\nEmperor; or he may, perhaps, really wish to preserve peace in Italy,\r\nand therefore declares himself an enemy of any one who disturbs it. It\r\nis even not impossible that the King of England expects to be rewarded\r\nby the Emperor after the victory, and hopes, perhaps, to get Normandy.\"\r\nClement three years before, when Cardinal de Medici, had admitted that\r\nhe knew little of English politics;[413] and his ignorance may explain\r\nhis inability to give a more satisfactory reason for Henry's conduct\r\nthan these tentative and far-fetched suggestions. But after the\r\npublication of Henry's State papers, it is not easy to arrive at any\r\nmore definite conclusion. The only motive Wolsey alleges, besides  (p. 149)\r\nthe _ex post facto_ excuses of Francis's conduct, is the recovery of\r\nHenry's rights to the crown of France; and if this were the real\r\nobject, it reduces both King and Cardinal to the level of political\r\ncharlatans. To conquer France was a madcap scheme, when Henry himself\r\nwas admitting the impossibility of raising 30,000 foot or 10,000\r\nhorse, without hired contingents from Charles's domains;[414] when,\r\naccording to Giustinian, it would have been hard to levy 100\r\nmen-at-arms or 1000 light cavalry in the whole island;[415] when the\r\nonly respectable military force was the archers, already an obsolete\r\narm. Invading hosts could never be victualled for more than three\r\nmonths, or stand a winter campaign; English troops were ploughmen by\r\nprofession and soldiers only by chance; Henry VII.'s treasure was\r\nexhausted, and efforts to raise money for fitful and futile inroads\r\nnearly produced a revolt. Henry VIII. himself was writing that to\r\nprovide for these inroads would prevent him keeping an army in\r\nIreland; and Wolsey was declaring that for the same reason English\r\ninterests in Scotland must take care of themselves, that border\r\nwarfare must be confined to the strictest defensive, and that a\r\n\"cheap\" deputy must be found for Ireland, who would rule it, like\r\nKildare, without English aid.[416] It is usual to lay the folly of the\r\npretence to the crown of France at Henry's door. But it is a curious\r\nfact that when Wolsey was gone, and Henry was his own prime minister,\r\nthis spirited foreign policy took a very subordinate place, and Henry\r\nturned his attention to the cultivation of his own garden instead of\r\nseeking to annex his neighbour's. It is possible that he was       (p. 150)\r\nbetter employed in wasting his people's blood and treasure in the\r\nfutile devastation of France, than in placing his heel on the Church\r\nand sending Fisher and More to the scaffold; but his attempts to\r\nreduce Ireland to order, and to unite England and Scotland, violent\r\nthough his methods may have been, were at least more sane than the\r\nquest for the crown of France, or even for the possession of\r\nNormandy.[417]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 412: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 626.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 413: _L. and P._, iii., 853.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 414: _L. and P._, iii., 2333, iv.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 415: _Desp._, App. ii., 309.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 416: _L. and P._, iii., 1252, 1646,\r\n                   1675.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 417: The policy of abstention was often\r\n                   urged at the council-table and opposed by Wolsey,\r\n                   who, according to More, used to repeat the fable of\r\n                   the men who hid in caves to keep out of the rain\r\n                   which was to make all whom it wetted fools, hoping\r\n                   thereby to have the rule over the fools (_L. and\r\n                   P._, vii., 1114; More, _English Works_, p. 1434).\r\n                   It had cost England, says More, many a fair penny.]\r\n\r\nYet if these were not Wolsey's aims, what were his motives? The\r\nessential thing for England was the maintenance of a fairly even\r\nbalance between Francis and Charles; and if Wolsey thought that would\r\nbest be secured by throwing the whole of England's weight into the\r\nEmperor's scale, he must have strangely misread the political\r\nsituation. He could not foresee, it may be said, the French debacle.\r\nIf so, it was from no lack of omens. Even supposing he was ignorant,\r\nor unable to estimate the effects, of the moral corruption of Francis,\r\nthe peculations of his mother Louise of Savoy, the hatred of the war,\r\nuniversal among the French lower classes, there were definite warnings\r\nfrom more careful observers.[418] As early as 1517 there were bitter\r\ncomplaints in France of the _gabelle_ and other taxes, and a Cordelier\r\ndenounced the French King as worse than Nero.[419] In 1519 an      (p. 151)\r\nanonymous Frenchman wrote that Francis had destroyed his own people,\r\nemptied his kingdom of money, and that the Emperor or some other would\r\nsoon have a cheap bargain of the kingdom, for he was more unsteady on\r\nhis throne than people thought.[420] Even the treason of Bourbon,\r\nwhich contributed so much to the French King's fall, was rumoured\r\nthree years before it occurred, and in 1520 he was known to be\r\n\"playing the malcontent\".[421] At the Field of Cloth of Gold Henry is\r\nsaid to have told Francis that, had he a subject like Bourbon, he\r\nwould not long leave his head on his shoulders.[422] All these details\r\nwere reported to the English Government and placed among English\r\narchives; and, indeed, at the English Court the general anticipation,\r\njustified by the event, was that Charles would carry the day.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 418: \"To hear how rich and poor lament\r\n                   the war would grieve any man's heart\" (Fitzwilliam\r\n                   to Wolsey, 18th Jan., 1521-22, _L. and P._, iii.,\r\n                   1971).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 419: _L. and P._, ii., 3702-3.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 420: _Ibid._, iii., 378.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 421: _Ibid._, iii., 404; _cf._ iii., 2446\r\n                   _ad fin._]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 422: Michelet, x., 131.]\r\n\r\nNo possible advantage could accrue to England from such a destruction\r\nof the balance of power; her position as mediator was only tenable so\r\nlong as neither Francis nor Charles had the complete mastery. War on\r\nthe Emperor was, no doubt, out of the question, but that was no reason\r\nfor war on France. Prudence counselled England to make herself strong,\r\nto develop her resources, and to hold her strength in reserve, while\r\nthe two rivals weakened each other by war. She would then be in a far\r\nbetter position to make her voice heard in the settlement, and would\r\nprobably have been able to extract from it all the benefits she could\r\nwith reason or justice demand. So obvious was the advantage of this\r\npolicy that for some time acute French statesmen refused to credit\r\nWolsey with any other. They said, reported an English envoy to     (p. 152)\r\nthe Cardinal, \"that your grace would make your profit with them and\r\nthe Emperor both, and proceed between them so that they might continue\r\nin war, and that the one destroy the other, and the King's highness\r\nmay remain and be their arbiter and superior\".[423] If it is urged\r\nthat Henry was bent on the war, and that Wolsey must satisfy the King\r\nor forfeit his power, even the latter would have been the better\r\nalternative. His fall would have been less complete and more\r\nhonourable than it actually was. Wolsey's failure to follow this\r\ncourse suggests that, by involving Henry in dazzling schemes of a\r\nforeign conquest, he was seeking to divert his attention from urgent\r\nmatters at home; that he had seen a vision of impending ruin; and that\r\nhis actions were the frantic efforts of a man to turn a steed, over\r\nwhich he has imperfect control, from the gulf he sees yawning ahead.\r\nThe only other explanation is that Wolsey sacrificed England's\r\ninterests in the hope of securing from Charles the gift of the papal\r\ntiara.[424]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 423: _L. and P._, iii, 2026.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 424: For another view see Busch,\r\n                   _Cardinal Wolsey und die Englisch-Kaiserliche\r\n                   Allianz_, 1522-25. Bonn, 1886.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, it was not for Clement VII. to deride England's\r\nconduct. The keen-sighted Pace had remarked in 1521 that, in the event\r\nof Charles's victory, the Pope would have to look to his affairs in\r\ntime.[425] The Emperor's triumph was, indeed, as fatal to the Papacy\r\nas it was to Wolsey. Yet Clement VII., on whom the full force of the\r\nblow was to fall, had, as Cardinal de Medici, been one of the chief\r\npromoters of the war. In August, 1521, the Venetian, Contarini,    (p. 153)\r\nreports Charles as saying that Leo rejected both the peace and the truce\r\nspeciously urged by Wolsey, and adds, on his own account, that he\r\nbelieves it the truth.[426] In 1522 Francis asserted that Cardinal de\r\nMedici \"was the cause of all this war\";[427] and in 1527 Clement VII.\r\nsought to curry favour with Charles by declaring that as Cardinal de\r\nMedici he had in 1521 caused Leo X. to side against France.[428] In\r\n1525 Charles declared that he had been mainly induced to enter on the\r\nwar by the persuasions of Leo,[429] over whom his cousin, the\r\nCardinal, then wielded supreme influence. So complete was his sway\r\nover Leo, that, on Leo's death, a cardinal in the conclave remarked\r\nthat they wanted a new Pope, not one who had already been Pope for\r\nyears; and the gibe turned the scale against the future Clement VII.\r\nMedici both, Leo and the Cardinal regarded the Papacy mainly as a\r\nmeans for family aggrandisement. In 1518 Leo had fulminated against\r\nFrancis Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, as \"the son of iniquity\r\nand child of perdition,\"[430] because he desired to bestow the duchy\r\non his nephew Lorenzo. In the family interest he was withholding\r\nModena and Reggio from Alfonso d'Este, and casting envious eyes on\r\nFerrara. In March, 1521, the French marched to seize some Milanese\r\nexiles, who were harboured at Reggio.[431] Leo took the opportunity to\r\nform an alliance with Charles for the expulsion of Francis from Italy.\r\nIt was signed at Worms on the 8th of May, the day on which Luther was\r\noutlawed;[432] and a war broke out in Italy, the effects of which  (p. 154)\r\nwere little foreseen by its principal authors. A veritable Nemesis\r\nattended this policy conceived in perfidy and greed. The battle of\r\nPavia made Charles more nearly dictator of Europe than any ruler has\r\nsince been, except Napoleon Bonaparte. It led to the sack of Rome and\r\nthe imprisonment of Clement VII. by Charles's troops. The dependence\r\nof the Pope on the Emperor made it impossible for Clement to grant\r\nHenry's petition for divorce, and his failure to obtain the divorce\r\nprecipitated Wolsey's fall.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 425: _L. and P._, iii., 1370.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 426: _Ven.

The edict was not issued till 25th May, but\r\n                   there was an intimate connection between the two\r\n                   events. It was in the same month that Luther's\r\n                   books were solemnly burnt in England, the ally of\r\n                   Pope and Emperor, and the extirpation of heresy was\r\n                   the first motive alleged for the alliance.]\r\n\r\nLeo, meanwhile, had gone to his account on the night of 1st-2nd\r\nDecember, 1521, singing \"Nunc dimittis\" for the expulsion of the\r\nFrench from Milan;[433] and amid the clangour of war the cardinals met\r\nto choose his successor. Their spirit belied their holy profession.\r\n\"All here,\" wrote Manuel, Charles's representative, \"is founded on\r\navarice and lies;\"[434] and again \"there cannot be so much hatred and\r\nso many devils in hell as among these cardinals\". \"The Papacy is in\r\ngreat decay\" echoed the English envoy Clerk, \"the cardinals brawl and\r\nscold; their malicious, unfaithful and uncharitable demeanour against\r\neach other increases every day.\"[435] Feeling between the French and\r\nimperial factions ran high, and the only question was whether an\r\nadherent of Francis or Charles would secure election. Francis had\r\npromised Wolsey fourteen French votes; but after the conference of\r\nCalais he would have been forgiving indeed had he wielded his influence\r\non behalf of the English candidate. Wolsey built more upon the     (p. 155)\r\npromise of Charles at Bruges;[436] but, if he really hoped for Charles's\r\nassistance, his sagacity was greatly to seek. The Emperor at no time\r\nmade any effort on Wolsey's behalf; he did him the justice to think\r\nthat, were Wolsey elected, he would be devoted more to English than to\r\nimperial interests; and he preferred a Pope who would be undividedly\r\nimperialist at heart. Pace was sent to join Clerk at Rome in urging\r\nWolsey's suit, and they did their best; but English influence at the\r\nCourt of Rome was infinitesimal. In spite of Campeggio's flattering\r\nassurance that Wolsey's name appeared in every scrutiny, and that\r\nsometimes he had eight or nine votes, and Clerk's statement that he\r\nhad nine at one time, twelve at another, and nineteen at a third,[437]\r\nWolsey's name only appears in one of the eleven scrutinies, and then\r\nhe received but seven out of eighty-one votes.[438] The election was\r\nlong and keenly contested. The conclave commenced on the 28th of\r\nDecember, and it was not till the 9th of January, 1522, that the\r\ncardinals, conscious of each other's defects, agreed to elect an\r\nabsentee, about whom they knew little. Their choice fell on Adrian,\r\nCardinal of Tortosa; and it is significant of the extent of Charles's\r\ninfluence, that the new Pope had been his tutor, and was proposed as a\r\ncandidate by the imperial ambassador on the day that the conclave\r\nopened.[439]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 433: _Sp.

In March Henry announced that he had taken upon\r\nhimself the protection of the Netherlands during Charles's impending\r\nvisit to Spain. Francis asserted that this was a plain declaration of\r\nwar, and seized the English wine-ships at Bordeaux. But he was\r\ndetermined not to take the formal offensive, and, in May, Clarencieux\r\nherald proceeded to France to bid him defiance.[441] In the following\r\nmonth Charles passed through England on his way to the south, and\r\nfresh treaties were signed for the invasion of France, for the\r\nmarriage of Mary and for the extirpation of heresy. At Windsor[442]\r\nWolsey constituted his legatine court to bind the contracting parties\r\nby oaths enforced by ecclesiastical censures. He arrogated to himself\r\na function usually reserved for the Pope, and undertook to arbitrate\r\nbetween Charles and Henry if disputes arose about the observance   (p. 157)\r\nof their engagements. But he obviously found difficulty in raising\r\neither money or men; and one of the suggestions at Windsor was that a\r\n\"dissembled peace\" or a two years' truce should be made with France,\r\nto give England time for more preparations for war.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 440: Francis \"begged Henry to consider\r\n                   what would happen now that a Pope had been elected\r\n                   entirely at Charles's devotion\" (_L. and P._, iii.,\r\n                   1994); but Adrian's attitude was at first\r\n                   independent (_Sp. Cal._, ii., 494, 504, 533). In\r\n                   July, 1522, however, he joined the league against\r\n                   Francis (_ibid._, ii., 574).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 441: _L. and P._, iii., 2140, 2224,\r\n                   2290.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 442: _Ibid._, iii., 2322, 2333; _Sp.\r\n                   Cal._, ii., 430, 435, 561.]\r\n\r\nNothing came of this last nefarious suggestion. In July Surrey captured\r\nand burnt Morlaix;[443] but, as he wrote from on board the _Mary\r\nRose_, Fitzwilliam's ships were without flesh or fish, and Surrey\r\nhimself had only beer for twelve days. Want of victuals prevented\r\nfurther naval successes, and, in September, Surrey was sent into\r\nArtois, where the same lack of organisation was equally fatal. It did\r\nnot, however, prevent him from burning farms and towns wherever he\r\nwent; and his conduct evoked from the French commander a just rebuke\r\nof his \"foul warfare\".[444] Henry himself was responsible; for Wolsey\r\nwrote on his behalf urging the destruction of Dourlens and the\r\nadjacent towns.[445] If Henry really sought to make these territories\r\nhis own, it was an odd method of winning the affections and developing\r\nthe wealth of the subjects he hoped to acquire. Nothing was really\r\naccomplished except devastation in France. Even this useless warfare\r\nexhausted English energies, and left the Borders defenceless against\r\none of the largest armies ever collected in Scotland. Wolsey and Henry\r\nwere only saved, from what might have been a most serious invasion, by\r\nDacre's dexterity and Albany's cowardice. Dacre, the warden of the\r\nmarches, signed a truce without waiting for instructions, and before\r\nit expired the Scots army disbanded. Henry and Wolsey might reprimand\r\nDacre for acting on his own responsibility, but they knew well     (p. 158)\r\nenough that Dacre had done them magnificent service.[446]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 443: _L. and P._, iii., 2362.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 444: _Ibid._, iii., 2541.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 445: _Ibid._, iii., 2551.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 446: _L. and P._, iii., 2537.]\r\n\r\nThe results of the war from the English point of view had as yet been\r\ncontemptible, but great things were hoped for the following year.\r\nBourbon, Constable of France, and the most powerful peer in the kingdom,\r\nintent on the betrayal of Francis, was negotiating with Henry and\r\nCharles the price of his treason.[447] The commons in France, worn to\r\nmisery by the taxes of Francis and the ravages of his enemies, were\r\neager for anything that might promise some alleviation of their lot.\r\nThey would even, it appears, welcome a change of dynasty; everywhere,\r\nHenry was told, they cried \"Vive le roi d'Angleterre!\"[448] Never,\r\nsaid Wolsey, would there be a better opportunity for recovering the\r\nKing's right to the French crown; and Henry exclaimed that he trusted\r\nto treat Francis as his father did Richard III. \"I pray God,\" wrote\r\nSir Thomas More to Wolsey, \"if it be good for his grace and for this\r\nrealm, that then it may prove so, and else in the stead thereof, I\r\npray God send his grace an honourable and profitable peace.\"[449] He\r\ncould scarcely go further in hinting his preference for peace to the\r\nfantastic design which now occupied the minds of his masters. Probably\r\nhis opinion of the war was not far from that of old Bishop Fox, who\r\ndeclared: \"I have determined, and, betwixt God and me, utterly\r\nrenounced the meddling with worldly matters, specially concerning war\r\nor anything to it appertaining (whereof, for the many intolerable\r\nenormities that I have seen ensue by the said war in time past, I  (p. 159)\r\nhave no little remorse in my conscience), thinking that if I did\r\ncontinual penance for it all the days of my life, though I should live\r\ntwenty years longer than I may do, I could not yet make sufficient\r\nrecompense therefor. And now, my good lord, to be called to fortifications\r\nof towns and places of war, or to any matter concerning the war, being\r\nof the age of seventy years and above, and looking daily to die, the\r\nwhich if I did, being in any such meddling of the war, I think I\r\nshould die in despair.\"[450] Protests like this and hints like More's\r\nwere little likely to move the militant Cardinal, who hoped to see the\r\nfinal ruin of France in 1523. Bourbon was to raise the standard of\r\nrevolt, Charles was to invade from Spain and Suffolk from Calais. In\r\nItaly French influence seemed irretrievably ruined. The Genoese\r\nrevolution, planned before the war, was effected; and the persuasions\r\nof Pace and the threats of Charles at last detached Venice and Ferrara\r\nfrom the alliance of France.[451]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 447: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 584; _L. and P._,\r\n                   iii., 2450, 2567, 2770, 2772, 2879, 3154.

Cal._, ii., 576, 594.]\r\n\r\nThe usual delays postponed Suffolk's invasion till late in the year.\r\nThey were increased by the emptiness of Henry's treasury. His father's\r\nhoard had melted away, and it was absolutely necessary to obtain\r\nlavish supplies from Parliament. But Parliament proved ominously\r\nintractable. Thomas Cromwell, now rising to notice, in a temperate\r\nspeech urged the folly of indulging in impracticable schemes of\r\nforeign conquest, while Scotland remained a thorn in England's\r\nside.[452] It was three months from the meeting of Parliament before\r\nthe subsidies were granted, and nearly the end of August before    (p. 160)\r\nSuffolk crossed to Calais with an army, \"the largest which has passed\r\nout of this realm for a hundred years\".[453] Henry and Suffolk wanted\r\nit to besiege Boulogne, which might have been some tangible result in\r\nEnglish hands.[454] But the King was persuaded by Wolsey and his\r\nimperial allies to forgo this scheme, and to order Suffolk to march\r\ninto the heart of France. Suffolk was not a great general, but he\r\nconducted the invasion with no little skill, and desired to conduct it\r\nwith unwonted humanity. He wished to win the French by abstaining from\r\npillage and proclaiming liberty, but Henry thought only the hope of\r\nplunder would keep the army together.[455] Waiting for the imperial\r\ncontingent under De Buren, Suffolk did not leave Calais till 19th\r\nSeptember. He advanced by Bray, Roye and Montdidier, capturing all the\r\ntowns that offered resistance. Early in November, he reached the Oise\r\nat a point less than forty miles from the French capital.[456] But\r\nBourbon's treason had been discovered; instead of joining Suffolk with\r\na large force, he was a fugitive from his country. Charles contented\r\nhimself with taking Fuentarabia,[457] and made no effort at invasion.\r\nThe imperial contingent with Suffolk's army went home; winter set in\r\nwith unexampled severity, and Vendome advanced.[458] The English were\r\ncompelled to retire; their retreat was effected without loss, and by\r\nthe middle of December the army was back at Calais. Suffolk is\r\nrepresented as being in disgrace for this retreat, and Wolsey as\r\nsaving him from the effects of his failure.[459] But even Wolsey   (p. 161)\r\ncan hardly have thought that an army of twenty-five thousand men could\r\nmaintain itself in the heart of France, throughout the winter, without\r\nsupport and with unguarded communications. The Duke's had been the\r\nmost successful invasion of France since the days of Henry V. from a\r\nmilitary point of view. That its results were negative is due to the\r\npolicy by which it was directed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 452: Merriman, _Cromwell's Letters_, i.,\r\n                   30-44; _L. and P._, iii., 2958, 3024; Hall,\r\n                   _Chronicle_, pp. 656, 657.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 453: _L. and P._, iii., 3281.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 454: _Ibid._, iii., 2360, 3319.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 455: _Ibid._, iii., 3346.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 456: _Ibid._, iii., 3452, 3485, 3505,\r\n                   3516.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 457: _Ibid._, iii., 2798, 2869.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 458: _Ibid._, iii., 3559, 3580, 3601.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 459: Brewer's Introd. to _L. and P._,\r\n                   vol. iv., p. ii., etc.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was another papal election. Adrian, one of the most\r\nhonest and unpopular of Popes, died on 14th September, 1523, and by\r\norder of the cardinals there was inscribed on his tomb: _Hic jacet\r\nAdrianus Sextus cui nihil in vita infelicius contigit quam quod\r\nimperaret._ With equal malice and keener wit the Romans erected to his\r\nphysician, Macerata, a statue with the title _Liberatori Patriae_.[460]\r\nWolsey was again a candidate. He told Henry he would rather continue\r\nin his service than be ten Popes.[461] That did not prevent him\r\ninstructing Pace and Clerk to further his claims. They were to\r\nrepresent to the cardinals Wolsey's \"great experience in the causes of\r\nChristendom, his favour with the Emperor, the King, and other princes,\r\nhis anxiety for Christendom, his liberality, the great promotions to\r\nbe vacated by his election, his frank, pleasant and courteous\r\ninclinations, his freedom from all ties of family or party, and the\r\nhopes of a great expedition against the infidel\".[462] Charles was, as\r\nusual, profuse in his promise of aid. He actually wrote a letter in\r\nWolsey's favour; but he took the precaution to detain the bearer   (p. 162)\r\nin Spain till the election was over.[463] He had already instructed\r\nhis minister at Rome to procure the election of Cardinal de Medici.\r\nThat ambassador mocked at Wolsey's hopes; \"as if God,\" he wrote,\r\n\"would perform a miracle every day\".[464] The Holy Spirit, by which\r\nthe cardinals always professed to be moved, was not likely to inspire\r\nthe election of another absentee after their experience of Adrian.\r\nWolsey had not the remotest chance, and his name does not occur in a\r\nsingle scrutiny. After the longest conclave on record, the imperial\r\ninfluence prevailed; on 18th November De Medici was proclaimed Pope,\r\nand he chose as his title Clement VII.[465]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 460: _Ibid._, iii., 3464.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 461: _Ibid._, iii., 3372.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 462: _Ibid._, 3389.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 463: _Sp.

He thought of retaining his name\r\n                   Julius, but was told that Popes who followed that\r\n                   practice always had short pontificates.]\r\n\r\nSuffolk's invasion was the last of England's active participation in\r\nthe war. Exhausted by her efforts, discontented with the Emperor's\r\nfailure to render assistance in the joint enterprise, or perceiving at\r\nlast that she had little to gain, and much to lose, from the overgrown\r\npower of Charles, England, in 1524, abstained from action, and even\r\nbegan to make overtures to Francis. Wolsey repaid Charles's inactivity\r\nof the previous year by standing idly by, while the imperial forces\r\nwith Bourbon's contingent invaded Provence and laid siege to\r\nMarseilles. But Francis still held command of the sea; the spirit of\r\nhis people rose with the danger; Marseilles made a stubborn and\r\nsuccessful defence; and, by October, the invading army was in headlong\r\nretreat towards Italy.[466] Had Francis been content with defending\r\nhis kingdom, all might have been well; but ambition lured him on   (p. 163)\r\nto destruction. He thought he had passed the worst of the trouble, and\r\nthat the prize of Milan might yet be his. So, before the imperialists\r\nwere well out of France, he crossed the Alps and sat down to besiege\r\nPavia. It was brilliantly defended by Antonio de Leyva. In November\r\nFrancis's ruin was thought to be certain; astrologers predicted his\r\ndeath or imprisonment.[467] Slowly and surely Pescara, the most\r\nconsummate general of his age, was pressing north with imperial troops\r\nto succour Pavia. Francis would not raise the siege. On 24th February,\r\n1525, he was attacked in front by Pescara and in the rear by De Leyva.\r\n\"The victory is complete,\" wrote the Abbot of Najera to Charles from\r\nthe field of battle, \"the King of France is made prisoner.... The\r\nwhole French army is annihilated.... To-day is feast of the Apostle\r\nSt. Mathias, on which, five and twenty years ago, your Majesty is said\r\nto have been born. Five and twenty thousand times thanks and praise to\r\nGod for His mercy! Your Majesty is, from this day, in a position to\r\nprescribe laws to Christians and Turks, according to your\r\npleasure.\"[468]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 466: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 686; _L. and P._,\r\n                   iv., 751, 753, 773, 774, 776.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 467: _Sp.

But what claim had he? By the most\r\nextraordinary misfortune or fatuity, England had not merely helped\r\nCharles to a threatening supremacy, but had retired from the       (p. 164)\r\nstruggle just in time to deprive herself of all claim to benefit by\r\nher mistaken policy. She had looked on while Bourbon invaded France,\r\nfearing to aid lest Charles would reap all the fruits of success. She\r\nhad sent no force across the channel to threaten Francis's rear. Not a\r\nsingle French soldier had been diverted from attacking Charles in\r\nItaly through England's interference. One hundred thousand crowns had\r\nbeen promised the imperial troops, but the money was not paid; and\r\nsecret negotiations had been going on with France. In spite of all,\r\nCharles had won, and he was naturally not disposed to divide the\r\nspoils. England's policy since 1521 had been disastrous to herself, to\r\nWolsey, to the Papacy, and even to Christendom. For the falling out of\r\nChristian princes seemed to the Turk to afford an excellent opportunity\r\nfor the faithful to come by his own. After an heroic defence by the\r\nknights of St. John, Rhodes, the bulwark of Christendom, had\r\nsurrendered to Selim. Belgrade, the strongest citadel in Eastern\r\nEurope, followed. In August, 1526, the King and the flower of\r\nHungarian nobility perished at the battle of Mohacz; and the\r\ninternecine strife of Christians seemed doomed to be sated only by\r\ntheir common subjugation to the Turk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHenry and Wolsey began to pay the price of their policy at home as\r\nwell as abroad. War was no less costly for being ineffective, and it\r\nnecessitated demands on the purses of Englishmen, to which they had\r\nlong been unused. In the autumn of 1522 Wolsey was compelled to have\r\nrecourse to a loan from both spiritualty and temporalty.[469] It seems\r\nto have met with a response which, compared with later receptions, (p. 165)\r\nmay be described as almost cheerful. But the loan did not go far, and\r\nbefore another six months had elapsed it was found necessary to summon\r\nParliament to make further provision.[470] The Speaker was Sir Thomas\r\nMore, who did all he could to secure a favourable reception of\r\nWolsey's demands. An unwonted spirit of independence animated the\r\nmembers; the debates were long and stormy; and the Cardinal felt\r\ncalled upon to go down to the House of Commons, and hector it in such\r\nfashion that even More was compelled to plead its privileges.\r\nEventually, some money was reluctantly granted; but it too was soon\r\nswallowed up, and in 1525 Wolsey devised fresh expedients. He was\r\nafraid to summon Parliament again, so he proposed what he called an\r\nAmicable Grant. It was necessary, he said, for Henry to invade France\r\nin person; if he went, he must go as a prince; and he could not go as\r\na prince without lavish supplies. So he required what was practically\r\na graduated income-tax. The Londoners resisted till they were told\r\nthat resistance might cost them their heads. In Suffolk and elsewhere\r\nopen insurrection broke out. It was then proposed to withdraw the\r\nfixed ratio, and allow each individual to pay what he chose as a\r\nbenevolence. A common councillor of London promptly retorted that\r\nbenevolences were illegal by statute of Richard III. Wolsey cared\r\nlittle for the constitution, and was astonished that any one should\r\nquote the laws of a wicked usurper; but the common councillor was a\r\nsound constitutionalist, if Wolsey was not. \"An it please your grace,\"\r\nhe replied, \"although King Richard did evil, yet in his time were  (p. 166)\r\nmany good acts made, not by him only, but by the consent of the body\r\nof the whole realm, which is Parliament.\"[471] There was no answer;\r\nthe demand was withdrawn. Never had Henry suffered such a rebuff, and\r\nhe never suffered the like again. Nor was this all; the whole of\r\nLondon, Wolsey is reported to have said, were traitors to Henry.[472]\r\nInformations of \"treasonable words\"--that ominous phrase--became\r\nfrequent.[473] Here, indeed, was a contrast to the exuberant loyalty\r\nof the early years of Henry's reign. The change may not have been\r\nentirely due to Wolsey, but he had been minister, with a power which\r\nfew have equalled, during the whole period in which it was effected,\r\nand Henry may well have begun to think that it was time for his\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 469: _L. and P._, iii., 2483.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 470: _L. and P._, iii., 2956, 2958,\r\n                   3249.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 471: Hall, _Chronicle_, ed. 1809, p.\r\n                   698.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 472: _L. and P._, iii., 3076.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 473: _Ibid._, iii., 3082.]\r\n\r\nWhether Wolsey was now anxious to repair his blunder by siding with\r\nFrancis against Charles, or to snatch some profit from the Emperor's\r\nvictory by completing the ruin of France, the refusal of Englishmen to\r\nfind more money for the war left him no option but peace. In April,\r\n1525, Tunstall and Sir Richard Wingfield were sent to Spain with\r\nproposals for the exclusion of Francis and his children from the\r\nFrench throne and the dismemberment of his kingdom.[474] It is\r\ndoubtful if Wolsey himself desired the fulfilment of so preposterous\r\nand iniquitous a scheme. It is certain that Charles was in no mood to\r\nabet it. He had no wish to extract profit for England out of the\r\nabasement of Francis, to see Henry King of France, or lord of any\r\nFrench provinces. He had no intention of even performing his part  (p. 167)\r\nof the Treaty of Windsor. He had pledged himself to marry the Princess\r\nMary, and the splendour of that match may have contributed to Henry's\r\ndesire for an alliance with Charles. But another matrimonial project\r\noffered the Emperor more substantial advantages. Ever since 1517 his\r\nSpanish subjects had been pressing him to marry the daughter of\r\nEmmanuel, King of Portugal. The Portuguese royal family had claims to\r\nthe throne of Castile which would be quieted by Charles's marriage\r\nwith a Portuguese princess. Her dowry of a million crowns was, also,\r\nan argument not to be lightly disregarded in Charles's financial\r\nembarrassments; and in March, 1526, the Emperor's wedding with\r\nIsabella of Portugal was solemnised.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 474: _Ibid._, iv., 1212, 1249, 1255,\r\n                   1264, 1296; _Stowe MS._, 147, ff. 67, 86 (Brit.\r\n                   Mus.).]\r\n\r\nWolsey, on his part, was secretly negotiating with Louise of Savoy\r\nduring her son's imprisonment in Spain. In August, 1525, a treaty of\r\namity was signed, by which England gave up all its claims to French\r\nterritory in return for the promise of large sums of money to Henry\r\nand his minister.[475] The impracticability of enforcing Henry's\r\npretensions to the French crown or to French provinces, which had been\r\nurged as excuses for squandering English blood and treasure, was\r\nadmitted, even when the French King was in prison and his kingdom\r\ndefenceless. But what good could the treaty do Henry or Francis?\r\nCharles had complete control over his captive, and could dictate his\r\nown terms. Neither the English nor the French King was in a position\r\nto continue the war; and the English alliance with France could abate\r\nno iota of the concessions which Charles extorted from Francis     (p. 168)\r\nin January, 1526, by the Treaty of Madrid.[476] Francis surrendered\r\nBurgundy; gave up his claims to Milan, Genoa and Naples; abandoned his\r\nallies, the King of Navarre, the Duke of Guelders and Robert de la\r\nMarck; engaged to marry Charles's sister Eleanor, the widowed Queen of\r\nPortugal; and handed over his two sons to the Emperor as hostages for\r\nthe fulfilment of the treaty. But he had no intention of keeping his\r\npromises. No sooner was he free than he protested that the treaty had\r\nbeen extracted by force, and that his oath to keep it was not binding.\r\nThe Estates of France readily refused their assent, and the Pope was,\r\nas usual, willing, for political reasons, to absolve Francis from his\r\noath. For the time being, consideration for the safety of his sons and\r\nthe hope of obtaining their release prevented him from openly breaking\r\nwith Charles, or listening to the proposals for a marriage with the\r\nPrincess Mary, held out as a bait by Wolsey.[477] The Cardinal's\r\nobject was merely to injure the Emperor as much as he could without\r\ninvolving England in war; and by negotiations for Mary's marriage,\r\nfirst with Francis, and then with his second son, the Duke of Orleans,\r\nhe was endeavouring to draw England and France into a closer alliance.\r\nFor similar reasons he was extending his patronage to the Holy League,\r\nformed by Clement VII. between the princes of Italy to liberate that\r\ndistressful country from the grip of the Spanish forces.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 475: _L. and P._, iv., 1525, 1531, 1600,\r\n                   1633.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 476: _L. and P._, iv., 1891.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 477: _Ibid._, iv., 2039, 2148, 2320,\r\n                   2325.]\r\n\r\nThe policy of Clement, of Venice, and of other Italian States had been\r\ncharacterised by as much blindness as that of England. Almost without\r\nexception they had united, in 1523, to expel the French from Italy.\r\nThe result was to destroy the balance of power south of the Alps,  (p. 169)\r\nand to deliver themselves over to a bondage more galling than that\r\nfrom which they sought to escape. Clement himself had been elected Pope\r\nby imperial influence, and the Duke of Sessa, Charles's representative\r\nin Rome, described him as entirely the Emperor's creature.[478] He\r\nwas, wrote Sessa, \"very reserved, irresolute, and decides few things\r\nhimself. He loves money and prefers persons who know where to find it\r\nto any other kind of men. He likes to give himself the appearance of\r\nbeing independent, but the result shows that he is generally governed\r\nby others.\"[479] Clement, however, after his election, tried to assume\r\nan attitude more becoming the head of Christendom than slavish dependence\r\non Charles. His love for the Emperor, he told Charles, had not\r\ndiminished, but his hatred for others had disappeared;[480] and\r\nthroughout 1524 he was seeking to promote concord between Christian\r\nprinces. His methods were unfortunate; the failure of the imperial\r\ninvasion of Provence and Francis's passage of the Alps, convinced the\r\nPope that Charles's star was waning, and that of France was in the\r\nascendant. \"The Pope,\" wrote Sessa to Charles V., \"is at the disposal\r\nof the conqueror.\"[481] So, on 19th January, 1525, a Holy League\r\nbetween Clement and Francis was publicly proclaimed at Rome, and\r\njoined by most of the Italian States.[482] It was almost the eve of\r\nPavia.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 478: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 610.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 479: _Ibid._, ii., 619.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 480: _Ibid._, ii., 707.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 481: _Ibid._, ii., 699, 30th Nov., 1524.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 482: _Ibid._, ii., 702-11.]\r\n\r\nCharles received the news of that victory with astonishing humility.\r\nBut he was not likely to forget that at the critical moment he had\r\nbeen deserted by most of his Italian allies; and it was with fear and\r\ntrembling that the Venetian ambassador besought him to use his     (p. 170)\r\nvictory with moderation.[483] Their conduct could hardly lead them\r\nto expect much from the Emperor's clemency. Distrust of his intentions\r\ninduced the Holy League to carry on desultory war with the imperial\r\ntroops; but mutual jealousies, the absence of effective aid from\r\nEngland or France, and vacillation caused by the feeling that after\r\nall it might be safer to accept the best terms they could obtain,\r\nprevented the war from being waged with any effect. In September,\r\n1526, Hugo de Moncada, the imperial commander, concerted with\r\nClement's bitter foes, the Colonnas, a means of overawing the Pope. A\r\ntruce was concluded, wrote Moncada, \"that the Pope, having laid down\r\nhis arms, may be taken unawares\".[484] On the 19th he marched on Rome.\r\nClement, taken unawares, fled to the castle of St. Angelo; his palace\r\nwas sacked, St. Peter's rifled, and the host profaned. \"Never,\" says\r\nCasale, \"was so much cruelty and sacrilege.\"[485]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 483: _Ven. Cal._, iii, 413.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 484: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 898.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 485: _L. and P._, iv., 2510.]\r\n\r\nIt was soon thrown into the shade by an outrage at which the whole\r\nworld stood aghast. Charles's object was merely to render the Pope his\r\nobedient slave; neither God nor man, said Moncada, could resist with\r\nimpunity the Emperor's victorious arms.[486] But he had little control\r\nover his own irresistible forces. With no enemy to check them, with no\r\npay to content them, the imperial troops were ravaging, pillaging,\r\nsacking cities and churches throughout Northern Italy without let or\r\nhindrance. At length a sudden frenzy seized them to march upon     (p. 171)\r\nRome. Moncada had shown them the way, and on 6th May, 1527, the\r\nHoly City was taken by storm. Bourbon was killed at the first assault;\r\nand the richest city in Christendom was given over to a motley,\r\nleaderless horde of German, Spanish and Italian soldiery. The Pope\r\nagain fled to the castle of St. Angelo; and for weeks Rome endured an\r\norgy of sacrilege, blasphemy, robbery, murder and lust, the horrors of\r\nwhich no brush could depict nor tongue recite. \"All the churches and\r\nthe monasteries,\" says a cardinal who was present, \"both of friars and\r\nnuns, were sacked. Many friars were beheaded, even priests at the\r\naltar; many old nuns beaten with sticks; many young ones violated,\r\nrobbed and made prisoners; all the vestments, chalices, silver, were\r\ntaken from the churches.... Cardinals, bishops, friars, priests, old\r\nnuns, infants, pages and servants--the very poorest--were tormented\r\nwith unheard-of cruelties--the son in the presence of his father, the\r\nbabe in the sight of its mother. All the registers and documents of\r\nthe Camera Apostolica were sacked, torn in pieces, and partly\r\nburnt.\"[487] \"Having entered,\" writes an imperialist to Charles, \"our\r\nmen sacked the whole Borgo and killed almost every one they found...\r\nAll the monasteries were rifled, and the ladies who had taken refuge\r\nin them carried off. Every person was compelled by torture to pay a\r\nransom.... The ornaments of all the churches were pillaged and the\r\nrelics and other things thrown into the sinks and cesspools. Even the\r\nholy places were sacked. The Church of St. Peter and the papal palace,\r\nfrom the basement to the top, were turned into stables for horses....\r\nEvery one considers that it has taken place by the just judgment   (p. 172)\r\nof God, because the Court of Rome was so ill-ruled.... We are\r\nexpecting to hear from your Majesty how the city is to be governed and\r\nwhether the Holy See is to be retained or not. Some are of opinion it\r\nshould not continue in Rome, _lest the French King should make a\r\npatriarch in his kingdom, and deny obedience to the said See, and the\r\nKing of England find all other Christian princes do the same_.\"[488]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 486: Buonaparte's _Narrative_, ed.\r\n                   Buchon, p. 190, ed.

Babylon the great was fallen, and become the\r\nhabitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit; her ruler was\r\nweighed in the balances and found wanting; his kingdom was divided and\r\ngiven to kings and peoples who came, like the Medes and the Persians,\r\nfrom the hardier realms of the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.

Its origin has\r\nbeen traced to various circumstances. On one hand, it is attributed to\r\nHenry's passion for Anne Boleyn, on the other, to doubts of the\r\nvalidity of Henry's marriage, raised by the Bishop of Tarbes in 1527,\r\nwhile negotiating a matrimonial alliance between the Princess Mary and\r\nFrancis I. These are the two most popular theories, and both are\r\ndemonstrably false.[490] Doubts of the legality of Henry's marriage\r\nhad existed long before the Bishop of Tarbes paid his visit to\r\nEngland, and even before Anne Boleyn was born. They were urged, not\r\nonly on the eve of the completion of the marriage, but when it was\r\nfirst suggested. In 1503, when Henry VII. applied to Julius II. for a\r\ndispensation to enable his second son to marry his brother's       (p. 174)\r\nwidow, the Pope replied that \"the dispensation was a great matter; nor\r\ndid he well know, _prima facie_, if it were competent for the Pope to\r\ndispense in such a case\".[491] He granted the dispensation, but the\r\ndoubts were not entirely removed. Catherine's confessor instilled them\r\ninto her mind, and was recalled by Ferdinand on that account. The\r\nSpanish King himself felt it necessary to dispel certain \"scruples of\r\nconscience\" Henry might entertain as to the \"sin\" of marrying his\r\nbrother's widow.[492] Warham and Fox debated the matter, and Warham\r\napparently opposed the marriage.[493] A general council had pronounced\r\nagainst the Pope's dispensing power;[494] and, though the Popes had,\r\nin effect, established their superiority over general councils, those\r\nwho still maintained the contrary view can hardly have failed to doubt\r\nthe legality of Henry's marriage.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 490: See, besides the original\r\n                   authorities cited in this chapter, Busch, _Der\r\n                   Ursprung der Ehescheidung Koenig Heinrichs VIII._\r\n                   (Hist.

On the 31st of January, 1510, seven months after his\r\nmarriage with Catherine, she gave birth to her first child; it was a\r\ndaughter, and was still-born.[495] On the 27th of May following    (p. 175)\r\nshe told her father that the event was considered in England to be of\r\nevil omen, but that Henry took it cheerfully, and she thanked God for\r\nhaving given her such a husband. \"The King,\" wrote Catherine's\r\nconfessor, \"adores her, and her highness him.\" Less than eight months\r\nlater, on the 1st of January, 1511, she was delivered of her first-born\r\nson.[496] A tourney was held to celebrate the joyous event, and the\r\nheralds received a handsome largess at the christening. The child was\r\nnamed Henry, styled Prince of Wales, and given a serjeant-at-arms on\r\nthe 14th, and a clerk of the signet on the 19th of February. Three\r\ndays later he was dead; he was buried at the cost of some ten thousand\r\npounds in Westminster Abbey. The rejoicings were turned to grief,\r\nwhich, aggravated by successive disappointments, bore with cumulative\r\nforce on the mind of the King and his people. In September, 1513, the\r\nVenetian ambassador announced the birth of another son,[497] who was\r\neither still-born, or died immediately afterwards. In June, 1514,\r\nthere is again a reference to the christening of the \"King's new\r\nson,\"[498] but he, too, was no sooner christened than dead.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 495: _D.N.B._, ix., 292, gives this date.\r\n                   Catherine herself, writing on 27th May, 1510, says\r\n                   that \"some _days_ before she had been delivered of\r\n                   a still-born daughter\" (_Sp. Cal._, ii., 43). On\r\n                   1st November, 1509, Henry informed Ferdinand that\r\n                   Catherine was pregnant, and the child had quickened\r\n                   (_ibid._, ii., 23).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 496: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 95-96; _L. and\r\n                   P._, vol. i., 1491, 1495, 1513, Pref., p. lxxiii.;\r\n                   ii., 4692.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 497: _Ven.

Ferdinand\r\nvalued his daughter mainly as a political emissary; he had formally\r\naccredited her as his ambassador at Henry's Court, and she naturally\r\nused her influence to maintain the political union between her father\r\nand her husband. The arrangement had serious drawbacks; when relations\r\nbetween sovereigns grew strained, their ambassadors could be       (p. 176)\r\nrecalled, but Catherine had to stay. In 1514 Henry was boiling over\r\nwith indignation at his double betrayal by the Catholic king; and it\r\nis not surprising that he vented some of his rage on the wife who was\r\nFerdinand's representative. He reproached her, writes Peter Martyr\r\nfrom Ferdinand's Court, with her father's ill-faith, and taunted her\r\nwith his own conquests. To this brutality Martyr attributes the\r\npremature birth of Catherine's fourth son towards the end of 1514.[499]\r\nHenry, in fact, was preparing to cast off, not merely the Spanish\r\nalliance, but his Spanish wife. He was negotiating for a joint attack\r\non Castile with Louis XII. and threatening the divorce of Catherine.[500]\r\n\"It is said,\" writes a Venetian from Rome in August, 1514, \"that the\r\nKing of England means to repudiate his present wife, the daughter of\r\nthe King of Spain and his brother's widow, because he is unable to\r\nhave children by her, and intends to marry a daughter of the French\r\nDuke of Bourbon.... He intends to annul his own marriage, and will\r\nobtain what he wants from the Pope as France did from Pope Julius\r\nII.\"[501]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 499: _L. and P._, i., 5718.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 500: See above p. 76.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 501: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 479. The Pope was\r\n                   really Alexander VI.]\r\n\r\nBut the death of Louis XII. (January, 1515) and the consequent\r\nloosening of the Anglo-French alliance made Henry and Ferdinand again\r\npolitical allies; while, as the year wore on, Catherine was known to\r\nbe once more pregnant, and Henry's hopes of issue revived. This time\r\nthey were not disappointed; the Princess Mary was born on the 18th of\r\nFebruary, 1516.[502] Ferdinand had died on the 23rd of January, but\r\nthe news was kept from Catherine, lest it might add to the risks   (p. 177)\r\nof her confinement.[503] The young princess seemed likely to live, and\r\nHenry was delighted. When Giustinian, amid his congratulations, said\r\nhe would have been better pleased had it been a son, the King replied:\r\n\"We are both young; if it was a daughter this time, by the grace of\r\nGod the sons will follow\".[504] All thoughts of a divorce passed away\r\nfor the time, but the desired sons did not arrive. In August, 1517,\r\nCatherine was reported to be again expecting issue, but nothing more\r\nis heard of the matter, and it is probable that about this time the\r\nQueen had various miscarriages. In July, 1518, Henry wrote to Wolsey\r\nfrom Woodstock that Catherine was once more pregnant, and that he\r\ncould not move the Court to London, as it was one of the Queen's\r\n\"dangerous times\".[505] His precautions were unavailing, and, on the\r\n10th of November, his child arrived still-born. Giustinian notes the\r\ngreat vexation with which the people heard the news, and expresses the\r\nopinion that, had it occurred a month or two earlier, the Princess\r\nMary would not have been betrothed to the French dauphin, \"as the one\r\nfear of England was lest it should pass into subjection to France\r\nthrough that marriage\".[506]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 502: _L. and P._, ii., 1505, 1573.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 503: _L. and P._, ii., 1563, 1610.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 504: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 691.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 505: _Cotton MS._, Vespasian, F, iii.,\r\n                   fol. 34, _b_; _cf. L. and P._, ii., 4074, 4288.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 506: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1103.]\r\n\r\nThe child was the last born of Catherine. For some years Henry went on\r\nhoping against every probability that he might still have male issue\r\nby his Queen; and in 1519 he undertook to lead a crusade against the\r\nTurk in person if he should have an heir.[507] But physicians summoned\r\nfrom Spain were no more successful than their English colleagues.  (p. 178)\r\nBy 1525 the last ray of hope had flickered out. Catherine was then\r\nforty years old; and Henry at the age of thirty-four, in the full\r\nvigour of youthful manhood, seemed doomed by the irony of fate and by\r\nhis union with Catherine to leave a disputed inheritance. Never did\r\nEngland's interests more imperatively demand a secure and peaceful\r\nsuccession. Never before had there been such mortality among the\r\nchildren of an English king; never before had an English king married\r\nhis brother's widow. So striking a coincidence could be only explained\r\nby the relation of cause and effect. Men who saw the judgment of God\r\nin the sack of Rome, might surely discern in the fatality that\r\nattended the children of Henry VIII. a fulfilment of the doom of\r\nchildlessness pronounced in the Book of the Law against him who should\r\nmarry his brother's wife. \"God,\" wrote the French ambassador in 1528,\r\n\"has long ago Himself passed sentence on it;\"[508] and there is no\r\nreason to doubt Henry's assertion, that he had come to regard the\r\ndeath of his children as a Divine judgment, and that he was impelled\r\nto question his marriage by the dictates of conscience. The \"scruples\r\nof conscience,\" which Henry VII. had urged as an excuse for delaying\r\nthe marriage, were merely a cloak for political reasons; but scruples\r\nof conscience are dangerous playthings, and the pretence of Henry VII.\r\nbecame, through the death of his children, a terrible reality to Henry\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 507: _L. and P._, iii., 432.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 508: Du Bellay to Montmorenci, 1st Nov.,\r\n                   1528, _L. and P._, iv., 4899.]\r\n\r\nQueen Catherine, too, had scruples of conscience about the marriage,\r\nthough of a different sort. When she first heard of Henry's intention\r\nto seek a divorce, she is reported to have said that \"she had      (p. 179)\r\nnot offended, but it was a judgment of God, for that her former marriage\r\nwas made in blood\"; the price of it had been the head of the innocent\r\nEarl of Warwick, demanded by Ferdinand of Aragon.[509] Nor was she\r\nalone in this feeling. \"He had heard,\" witnessed Buckingham's chancellor\r\nin 1521, \"the Duke grudge that the Earl of Warwick was put to death,\r\nand say that God would punish it, by not suffering the King's issue to\r\nprosper, as appeared by the death of his sons; and that his daughters\r\nprosper not, and that he had no issue male.\"[510]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 509: _Sp. Cal._, i., 249; _L. and P. of\r\n                   Richard III. and Henry VII._, vol. i., pp. xxxiii.,\r\n                   113; Hall, _Chron_., p. 491; Bacon, _Henry VII._,\r\n                   ed. 1870, p. 376; _Transactions of the Royal Hist.\r\n                   Soc._, N.S., xviii., 187.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 510: _L. and P._, iii., 1284.]\r\n\r\nConscience, however, often moves men in directions indicated by other\r\nthan conscientious motives, and, of the other motives which influenced\r\nHenry's mind, some were respectable and some the reverse. The most\r\nlegitimate was his desire to provide for the succession to the throne.\r\nIt was obvious to him and his council that, if he died with no\r\nchildren but Mary, England ran the risk of being plunged into an\r\nanarchy worse than that of the civil wars. \"By English law,\" wrote\r\nFalier, the Venetian ambassador, in 1531, \"females are excluded from\r\nthe throne;\"[511] that was not true, but it was undoubtedly a\r\nwidespread impression, based upon the past history of England. No\r\nQueen-Regnant had asserted a right to the English throne but one, and\r\nthat one precedent provided the most effective argument for avoiding a\r\nrepetition of the experiment. Matilda was never crowned, though she\r\nhad the same claim to the throne as Mary, and her attempt to       (p. 180)\r\nenforce her title involved England in nineteen years of anarchy and\r\ncivil war. Stephen stood to Matilda in precisely the same relation as\r\nJames V. of Scotland stood to the Princess Mary; and in 1532, as soon\r\nas he came of age, James was urged to style himself \"Prince of England\"\r\nand Duke of York, in manifest derogation of Mary's title.[512] At that\r\ntime Charles V. was discussing alternative plans for deposing Henry\r\nVIII. One was to set up James V., the other to marry Mary to some\r\ngreat English noble and proclaim them King and Queen;[513] Mary by\r\nherself was thought to have no chance of success. John of Gaunt had\r\nmaintained in Parliament that the succession descended only through\r\nmales;[514] the Lancastrian case was that Henry IV., the son of Edward\r\nIII.'s fourth son, had a better title to the throne than Philippa, the\r\ndaughter of the third; an Act limiting the succession to the male line\r\nwas passed in 1406;[515] and Henry VII. himself only reigned through a\r\ntacit denial of the right of women to sit on the English throne.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 511: _Ven. Cal._, iv., 300.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 512: _L. and P._, v., 609, 817.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 513: _Ibid._, vi., 446.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 514: _Chronicon Angliae_, Rolls Ser., p.\r\n                   92, _s.a._, 1376; _D.N.B._, xxix., 421. This became\r\n                   the orthodox Lancastrian theory (_cf._ Fortescue,\r\n                   _Governance of England_, ed. Plummer, pp. 352-55).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 515: Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, iii., 58.\r\n                   This Act was, however, repealed before the end of\r\n                   the same year.]\r\n\r\nThe objection to female sovereigns was grounded not so much on male\r\ndisbelief in their personal qualifications, as upon the inevitable\r\nconsequence of matrimonial and dynastic problems.[516] If the Princess\r\nMary succeeded, was she to marry? If not, her death would leave    (p. 181)\r\nthe kingdom no better provided with heirs than before; and in her weak\r\nstate of health, her death seemed no distant prospect. If, on the\r\nother hand, she married, her husband must be either a subject or a\r\nforeign prince. To marry a subject would at once create discords like\r\nthose from which the Wars of the Roses had sprung; to marry a foreign\r\nprince was to threaten Englishmen, then more jealous than ever of\r\nforeign influence, with the fear of alien domination. They had before\r\ntheir eyes numerous instances in which matrimonial alliances had\r\ninvolved the union of states so heterogeneous as Spain and the\r\nNetherlands; and they had no mind to see England absorbed in some\r\ncontinental empire. In the matrimonial schemes arranged for the\r\nprincess, it was generally stipulated that she should, in default of\r\nmale heirs, succeed to the throne of England; her succession was\r\nobviously a matter of doubt, and it is quite certain that her marriage\r\nin France or in Spain would have proved a bar in the way of her\r\nsuccession to the English throne, or at least have given rise to\r\nconflicting claims.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 516: Professor Maitland has spoken of the\r\n                   \"Byzantinism\" of Henry's reign, and possibly the\r\n                   objection to female sovereigns was strengthened by\r\n                   the prevalent respect for Roman imperial and\r\n                   Byzantine custom (_cf._ Hodgkin, _Charles the\r\n                   Great_, p. 180).]\r\n\r\nThese rival pretensions began to be heard as soon as it became evident\r\nthat Henry VIII. would have no male heirs by Catherine of Aragon. In\r\n1519, a year after the birth of the Queen's last child, Giustinian\r\nreported to the Venetian signiory on the various nobles who had hopes\r\nof the crown. The Duke of Norfolk had expectations in right of his\r\nwife, a daughter of Edward IV., and the Duke of Suffolk in right of\r\nhis Duchess, the sister of Henry VIII. But the Duke of Buckingham was\r\nthe most formidable: \"It was thought that, were the King to die\r\nwithout male heirs, that Duke might easily obtain the crown\".[517] (p. 182)\r\nHis claims had been canvassed in 1503, when the issue of Henry VII.\r\nseemed likely to fail,[518] and now that the issue of Henry VIII. was\r\nin even worse plight, Buckingham's claims to the crown became again a\r\nmatter of comment. His hopes of the crown cost him his head; he had\r\nalways been discontented with Tudor rule, especially under Wolsey; he\r\nallowed himself to be encouraged with hopes of succeeding the King,\r\nand possibly spoke of asserting his claim in case of Henry's death.\r\nThis was to touch Henry on his tenderest spot, and, in 1521, the Duke\r\nwas tried by his peers, found guilty of high treason, and sent to the\r\nblock.[519] In this, as in all the great trials of Henry's reign, and\r\nindeed in most state trials of all ages, considerations of justice\r\nwere subordinated to the real or supposed dictates of political\r\nexpediency. Buckingham was executed, not because he was a criminal,\r\nbut because he was, or might become, dangerous; his crime was not\r\ntreason, but descent from Edward III. Henry VIII., like Henry VII.,\r\nshowed his grasp of the truth that nothing makes a government so\r\nsecure as the absence of all alternatives.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 517: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1287. Buckingham's\r\n                   end was undoubtedly hastened by Wolsey's jealousy;\r\n                   before the end of 1518 the Cardinal had been\r\n                   instilling into Henry's ear suspicions of\r\n                   Buckingham (_L. and P._, iii., 1; _cf. ibid._, ii.,\r\n                   3973, 4057). Brewer regards the hostility of Wolsey\r\n                   to Buckingham as one of Polydore Vergil's\r\n                   \"calumnies\" (_ibid._, vol. iii., Introd., p.\r\n                   lxvi.).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 518: _L. and P. of Richard III. and Henry\r\n                   VII._, i., 233.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 519: See detailed accounts in _L. and\r\n                   P._, iii., 1284, 1356. Shakespeare's account in\r\n                   \"Henry VIII.\" is remarkably accurate, except in\r\n                   matters of date.]\r\n\r\nBuckingham's execution is one of the symptoms that, as early as 1521,\r\nthe failure of his issue had made Henry nervous and susceptible about\r\nthe succession. Even in 1519, when Charles V.'s minister,          (p. 183)\r\nChievres, was proposing to marry his niece to the Earl of Devonshire,\r\na grandson of Edward IV., Henry was suspicious, and Wolsey inquired\r\nwhether Chievres was \"looking to any chance of the Earl's succession\r\nto the throne of England.\"[520] If further proof were needed that\r\nHenry's anxiety about the succession was not, as has been represented,\r\na mere afterthought intended to justify his divorce from Catherine, it\r\nmight be found in the extraordinary measures taken with regard to his\r\none and only illegitimate son. The boy was born in 1519. His mother\r\nwas Elizabeth Blount, sister of Erasmus's friend, Lord Mountjoy; and\r\nshe is noticed as taking part in the Court revels during the early\r\nyears of Henry's reign.[521] Outwardly, at any rate, Henry's Court was\r\nlong a model of decorum; there was no parade of vice as in the days of\r\nCharles II., and the existence of this royal bastard was so effectually\r\nconcealed that no reference to him occurs in the correspondence of the\r\ntime until 1525, when it was thought expedient to give him a position\r\nof public importance. The necessity of providing some male successor\r\nto Henry was considered so urgent that, two years before the divorce\r\nis said to have occurred to him, he and his council were meditating a\r\nscheme for entailing the succession on the King's illegitimate son. In\r\n1525 the child was created Duke of Richmond and Somerset. These titles\r\nwere significant; Earl of Richmond had been Henry VII.'s title before\r\nhe came to the throne; Duke of Somerset had been that of his grandfather\r\nand of his youngest son. Shortly afterwards the boy was made Lord  (p. 184)\r\nHigh Admiral of England, Lord Warden of the Marches, and Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland,[522] the two latter being offices which Henry\r\nVIII. himself had held in his early youth. In January, 1527, the\r\nSpanish ambassador reported that there was a scheme on foot to make\r\nthe Duke King of Ireland;[523] it was obviously a design to prepare\r\nthe way for his succession to the kingdom of England. The English\r\nenvoys in Spain were directed to tell the Emperor that Henry proposed\r\nto demand some noble princess of near blood to the Emperor as a wife\r\nfor the Duke of Richmond. The Duke, they were to say, \"is near of the\r\nKing's blood and of excellent qualities, and is already furnished to\r\nkeep the state of a great prince, and yet may be easily, by the King's\r\nmeans, exalted to higher things\".[524] The lady suggested was Charles's\r\nniece, a daughter of the Queen of Portugal; she was already promised\r\nto the Dauphin of France, but the envoys remarked that, if that match\r\nwere broken off, she might find \"another dauphin\" in the Duke of\r\nRichmond. Another plan for settling the succession was that the Duke\r\nshould, by papal dispensation, marry his half-sister Mary! Cardinal\r\nCampeggio saw no moral objection to this. \"At first I myself,\" he\r\nwrites on his arrival in England in October, 1528, \"had thought of\r\nthis as a means of establishing the succession, but I do not believe\r\nthat this design would suffice to satisfy the King's desires.\"[525]\r\nThe Pope was equally willing to facilitate the scheme, on          (p. 185)\r\ncondition that Henry abandoned his divorce from Catherine.[526] Possibly\r\nHenry saw more objections than Pope or Cardinal to a marriage between\r\nbrother and sister. At all events Mary was soon betrothed to the\r\nFrench prince, and the Emperor recorded his impression that the French\r\nmarriage was designed to remove the Princess from the Duke of\r\nRichmond's path to the throne.[527]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 520: _L. and P._, iii., 386.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 521: _Ibid._, ii., p. 1461.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 522: See G.E.

In _ibid._,\r\n                   iv., 3135, Richmond is styled \"The Prince\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 525: Laemmer, _Monumenta Vaticana_, p.\r\n                   29; _L. and P._, iv., 4881. It was claimed that the\r\n                   Pope's dispensing power was unlimited, extending\r\n                   even to marriages between brothers and sisters\r\n                   (_ibid._, v., 468). Campeggio told Du Bellay in\r\n                   1528 that the Pope's power was \"infinite\" (_ibid._,\r\n                   iv., 4942).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 526: _L. and P._, iv., 5072.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 527: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 482.]\r\n\r\nThe conception of this violent expedient is mainly of interest as\r\nillustrating the supreme importance attached to the question of\r\nproviding for a male successor to Henry. He wanted an heir to the\r\nthrone, and he wanted a fresh wife for that reason. A mistress would\r\nnot satisfy him, because his children by a mistress would hardly\r\nsucceed without dispute to the throne, not because he laboured under\r\nany moral scruples on the point. He had already had two mistresses,\r\nElizabeth Blount, the mother of the Duke of Richmond, and Anne's\r\nsister, Mary Boleyn. Possibly, even probably, there were other lapses\r\nfrom conjugal fidelity, for, in 1533, the Duke of Norfolk told Chapuys\r\nthat Henry was always inclined to amours;[528] but none are capable of\r\ndefinite proof, and if Henry had other illegitimate children besides\r\nthe Duke of Richmond it is difficult to understand why their existence\r\nshould have been so effectually concealed when such publicity was\r\ngiven their brother. The King is said to have had ten mistresses in\r\n1528, but the statement is based on a misrepresentation of the only\r\ndocument adduced in its support.[529] It is a list of New Year's   (p. 186)\r\npresents,[530] which runs \"To thirty-three noble ladies\" such and such\r\ngifts, then \"to ten mistresses\" other gifts; it is doubtful if the\r\nword then bore its modern sinister signification; in this particular\r\ninstance it merely means \"gentlewomen,\" and differentiates them from\r\nthe noble ladies. Henry's morals, indeed, compare not unfavourably\r\nwith those of other sovereigns. His standard was neither higher nor\r\nlower than that of Charles V., who was at this time negotiating a\r\nmarriage between his natural daughter and the Pope's nephew; it was\r\nnot lower than those of James II., of William III., or of the first\r\ntwo Georges; it was infinitely higher than the standard of Francis I.,\r\nof Charles II., or even of Henry of Navarre and Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 528: _L. and P._, vi., 241.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 529: E.L. Taunton, _Wolsey_, 1902, p.\r\n                   173, where the words are erroneously given as \"To\r\n                   the King's ten mistresses\"; \"the King's\" is an\r\n                   interpolation.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 530: _L. and P._, iv., 3748.]\r\n\r\nThe gross immorality so freely imputed to Henry seems to have as\r\nlittle foundation as the theory that his sole object in seeking the\r\ndivorce from Catherine and separation from Rome was the gratification\r\nof his passion for Anne Boleyn. If that had been the case, there would\r\nbe no adequate explanation of the persistence with which he pursued\r\nthe divorce. He was \"studying the matter so diligently,\" Campeggio\r\nsays, \"that I believe in this case he knows more than a great\r\ntheologian and jurist\"; he was so convinced of the justice of his\r\ncause \"that an angel descending from heaven would be unable to\r\npersuade him otherwise\".[531] He sent embassy after embassy to Rome;\r\nhe risked the enmity of Catholic Europe; he defied the authority of\r\nthe vicar of Christ; and lavished vast sums to obtain verdicts in his\r\nfavour from most of the universities in Christendom. It is not     (p. 187)\r\ncredible that all this energy was expended merely to satisfy a sensual\r\npassion, which could be satisfied without a murmur from Pope or Emperor,\r\nif he was content with Anne Boleyn as a mistress, and is believed to\r\nhave been already satisfied in 1529, four years before the divorce was\r\nobtained.[532] So, too, the actual sentence of divorce in 1533 was\r\nprecipitated not by Henry's passion for Anne, but by the desire that\r\nher child should be legitimate. She was pregnant before Henry was\r\nmarried to her or divorced from Catherine. But, though the representation\r\nof Henry's passion for Anne Boleyn as the sole _fons et origo_ of the\r\ndivorce is far from convincing, that passion introduced various\r\ncomplications into the question; it was not merely an additional\r\nincentive to Henry's desires; it also brought Wolsey and Henry into\r\nconflict; and the unpopularity of the divorce was increased by the\r\nfeeling that Henry was losing caste by seeking to marry a lady of the\r\nrank and character of Anne Boleyn.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 531: _Ibid._, iv., 4858.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 532: No conclusive evidence on this point\r\n                   is possible; the French ambassador, Clement VII.\r\n                   and others believed that Henry VIII. and Anne\r\n                   Boleyn had been cohabiting since 1529. On the other\r\n                   hand, if such was the case, it is singular that no\r\n                   child should have been born before 1533; for after\r\n                   that date Anne seems to have had a miscarriage\r\n                   nearly every year. Ortiz, indeed, reports from Rome\r\n                   that she had a miscarriage in 1531 (_L. and P._,\r\n                   v., 594), but the evidence is not good.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Boleyns were wealthy merchants of London, of which one of them had\r\nbeen Lord-Mayor, but Anne's mother was of noble blood, being daughter\r\nand co-heir of the Earl of Ormonde,[533] and it is a curious fact that\r\nall of Henry's wives could trace their descent from Edward I.[534]\r\nAnne's age is uncertain, but she is generally believed to have     (p. 188)\r\nbeen born in 1507.[535] Attempts have been made to date her influence\r\nover the King by the royal favours bestowed on her father, Sir Thomas,\r\nafterwards Viscount Rochford and Earl of Wiltshire, but, as these\r\nfavours flowed in a fairly regular stream from the beginning of the\r\nreign, as Sir Thomas's services were at least a colourable excuse for\r\nthem, and as his other daughter Mary was Henry's mistress before he\r\nfell in love with Anne, these grants are not a very substantial ground\r\nupon which to build. Of Anne herself little is known except that,\r\nabout 1519, she was sent as maid of honour to the French Queen,\r\nClaude; five years before, her sister Mary had accompanied Mary Tudor\r\nin a similar capacity on her marriage with Louis XII.[536] In 1522,\r\nwhen war with France was on the eve of breaking out, Anne was recalled\r\nto the English Court,[537] where she took part in revels and\r\nlove-intrigues. Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet, although a married man,\r\nsued for her favours;[538] Henry, Lord Percy made her more honest\r\nproposals, but was compelled to desist by the King himself, who    (p. 189)\r\nhad arranged for her marriage with Piers Butler, son of the Earl\r\nof Ormond, as a means to end the feud between the Butler and the\r\nBoleyn families.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 533: See Friedmann's _Anne Boleyn_, 2\r\n                   vols., 1884, and articles on the Boleyn family in\r\n                   _D.N.B._, vol. v.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 534: See George Fisher, _Key to the\r\n                   History of England_, Table xvii.; _Gentleman's\r\n                   Magazine_, May, 1829.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 535: Henry would then be fifteen, yet a\r\n                   fable was invented and often repeated that Henry\r\n                   VIII. was Anne Boleyn's father.

As Wyatt complained in a sonnet,[539]\r\n\r\n  There is written her fair neck round about\r\n  _Noli me tangere_; for Caesar's I am\r\n  And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.\r\n\r\nBut, for any definite documentary evidence to the contrary, it might\r\nbe urged that Henry's passion for Anne was subsequent to the\r\ncommencement of his proceedings for a divorce from Catherine. Those\r\nproceedings began at least as early as March, 1527, while the first\r\nallusion to the connection between the King and Anne Boleyn occurs in\r\nthe instructions to Dr. William Knight, sent in the following autumn\r\nto procure a dispensation for her marriage with Henry.[540] The King's\r\nfamous love-letters, the earliest of which are conjecturally assigned\r\nto July, 1527,[541] are without date and with but slight internal\r\nindications of the time at which they were written; they may be earlier\r\nthan 1527, they may be as late as the following winter. It is unlikely\r\nthat Henry would have sought for the Pope's dispensation to marry  (p. 190)\r\nAnne until he was assured of her consent, of which in some of the\r\nletters he appears to be doubtful; on the other hand, it is difficult\r\nto see how a lady of the Court could refuse an offer of marriage made\r\nby her sovereign. Her reluctance was to fill a less honourable\r\nposition, into which Henry was not so wicked as to think of forcing\r\nher. \"I trust,\" he writes in one of his letters, \"your absence is not\r\nwilful on your part; for if so, I can but lament my ill-fortune, and\r\nby degrees abate my great folly.\"[542] His love for Anne Boleyn was\r\ncertainly his \"great folly,\" the one overmastering passion of his\r\nlife. There is, however, nothing very extraordinary in the letters\r\nthemselves; in one he says he has for more than a year been \"wounded\r\nwith the dart of love,\" and is uncertain whether Anne returns his\r\naffection. In others he bewails her briefest absence as though it were\r\nan eternity; desires her father to hasten his return to Court; is torn\r\nwith anxiety lest Anne should take the plague, comforts her with the\r\nassurance that few women have had it, and sends her a hart killed by\r\nhis own hand, making the inevitable play on the word. Later on, he\r\nalludes to the progress of the divorce case; excuses the shortness of\r\na letter on the ground that he has spent four hours over the book he\r\nwas writing in his own defence[543] and has a pain in his head. The\r\nseries ends with an announcement that he has been fitting up apartments\r\nfor her, and with congratulations to himself and to her that the\r\n\"well-wishing\" Legate, Campeggio, who has been sent from Rome to   (p. 191)\r\ntry the case, has told him he was not so \"imperial\" in his sympathies\r\nas had been alleged.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 539: Wyatt, _Works_, ed.

She is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long\r\nneck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised, and in fact has nothing but\r\nthe King's great appetite, and her eyes, which are black and\r\nbeautiful\".[544] She had probably learnt in France the art of using\r\nher beautiful eyes to the best advantage; her hair, which was long and\r\nblack, she wore loose, and on her way to her coronation Cranmer\r\ndescribes her as \"sitting _in_ her hair\".[545] Possibly this was one\r\nof the French customs, which somewhat scandalised the staider ladies\r\nof the English Court. She is said to have had a slight defect on one\r\nof her nails, which she endeavoured to conceal behind her other\r\nfingers.[546] Of her mental accomplishments there is not much evidence;\r\nshe naturally, after some years' residence at the Court of France,\r\nspoke French, though she wrote it in an orthography that was quite her\r\nown. Her devotion to the Gospel is the one great virtue with which\r\nFoxe and other Elizabethans strove to invest the mother of the Good\r\nQueen Bess. But it had no nobler foundation than the facts that Anne's\r\nposition drove her into hostility to the Roman jurisdiction, and that\r\nher family shared the envy of church goods, common to the nobility and\r\nthe gentry of the time.[547] Her place in English history is due   (p. 192)\r\nsolely to the circumstance that she appealed to the less refined part\r\nof Henry's nature; she was pre-eminent neither in beauty nor in\r\nintellect, and her virtue was not of a character to command or deserve\r\nthe respect of her own or subsequent ages.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 544: _Ven. Cal._, iv., 365.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 545: Cranmer, _Works_ (Parker Soc.), ii.,\r\n                   245; _cf. Ven.

In 1531 Chapuys described Anne and her\r\n                   father as being \"more Lutheran than Luther himself\"\r\n                   (_L. and P._, v., 148), in 1532 as \"true apostles\r\n                   of the new sect\" (_ibid._, v., 850), and in 1533 as\r\n                   \"perfect Lutherans\" (_ibid._, vi., 142).]\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with her rival, Queen Catherine, the third of the\r\nprincipal characters involved in the divorce. If Henry's motives were\r\nnot so entirely bad as they have often been represented, neither they\r\nnor Anne Boleyn's can stand a moment's comparison with the unsullied\r\npurity of Catherine's life or the lofty courage with which she defended\r\nthe cause she believed to be right. There is no more pathetic figure\r\nin English history, nor one condemned to a crueller fate. No breath of\r\nscandal touched her fair name, or impugned her devotion to Henry. If\r\nshe had the misfortune to be identified with a particular policy, the\r\nalliance with the House of Burgundy, the fault was not hers; she had\r\nbeen married to Henry in consideration of the advantages which that\r\nalliance was supposed to confer; and, if she used her influence to\r\nfurther Spanish interest, it was a natural feeling as near akin to\r\nvirtue as to vice, and Carroz at least complained, in 1514, that she\r\nhad completely identified herself with her husband and her husband's\r\nsubjects.[548] If her miscarriages and the death of her children   (p. 193)\r\nwere a grief to Henry, the pain and the sorrow were hers in far\r\ngreater measure; if they had made her old and deformed, as Francis\r\nbrutally described her in 1519,[549] the fact must have been far more\r\nbitter to her than it was unpleasant to Henry. There may have been\r\nsome hardship to Henry in the circumstance that, for political\r\nmotives, he had been induced by his council to marry a wife who was\r\nsix years his senior; but to Catherine herself a divorce was the\r\nheight of injustice. The question was in fact one of justice against a\r\nreal or supposed political necessity, and in such cases justice\r\ncommonly goes to the wall. In politics, men seek to colour with\r\njustice actions based upon considerations of expediency. They first\r\nconvince themselves, and then they endeavour with less success to\r\npersuade mankind.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 548: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 201.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 549: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1230.]\r\n\r\nSo Henry VIII. convinced himself that the dispensation granted by\r\nJulius II. was null and void, that he had never been married to\r\nCatherine, and that to continue to live with his brother's wife was\r\nsin. \"The King,\" he instructed his ambassador to tell Charles V. in\r\n1533, \"taketh himself to be in the right, not because so many say it,\r\nbut because he, being learned, knoweth the matter to be right.... The\r\njustice of our cause is so rooted in our breast that nothing can\r\nremove it, and even the canons say that a man should rather endure all\r\nthe censures of the Church than offend his conscience.\"[550] No man\r\nwas less tolerant of heresy than Henry, but no man set greater     (p. 194)\r\nstore on his own private judgment. To that extent he was a Protestant;\r\n\"though,\" he instructed Paget in 1534 to tell the Lutheran princes,\r\n\"the law of every man's conscience be but a private court, yet it is\r\nthe highest and supreme court for judgment or justice\". God and his\r\nconscience, he told Chapuys in 1533, were on very good terms.[551] On\r\nanother occasion he wrote to Charles _Ubi Spiritus Domini, ibi\r\nlibertas_,[552] with the obvious implication that he possessed the\r\nspirit of the Lord, and therefore he might do as he liked. To him, as\r\nto St. Paul, all things were lawful; and Henry's appeals to the Pope,\r\nto learned divines, to universities at home and abroad, were not for\r\nhis own satisfaction, but were merely concessions to the profane herd,\r\nunskilled in royal learning and unblessed with a kingly conscience.\r\nAgainst that conviction, so firmly rooted in the royal breast, appeals\r\nto pity were vain, and attempts to shake it were perilous. It was his\r\nconscience that made Henry so dangerous. Men are tolerant of\r\ndifferences about things indifferent, but conscience makes bigots of\r\nus all; theological hatreds are proverbially bitter, and religious\r\nwars are cruel. Conscience made Sir Thomas More persecute, and glory\r\nin the persecution of heretics,[553] and conscience earned Mary her\r\nepithet \"Bloody\". They were moved by conscientious belief in the\r\nCatholic faith, Henry by conscientious belief in himself; and\r\nconscientious scruples are none the less exigent for being reached by\r\ncrooked paths.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 550: _L. and P._, vi., 775. _Hoc volo,\r\n                   sic jubeo; stet pro ratione voluntas._ Luther\r\n                   quoted this line _a propos_ of Henry; see his\r\n                   preface to Robert Barnes' _Bekenntniss des\r\n                   Glaubens_, Wittemberg, 1540.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 551: _L. and P._, vi., 351; vii., 148.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 552: _Ibid._, iv., 6111.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 553: It has been denied that More either\r\n                   persecuted or gloried in the persecution of\r\n                   heretics; but he admits himself that he recommended\r\n                   corporal punishment in two cases and \"it is clear\r\n                   that he underestimated his activity\" (_D.N.B._,\r\n                   xxxviii., 436, and instances and authorities there\r\n                   cited).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.                                                      (p. 195)\r\n\r\nTHE POPE'S DILEMMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1527, in pursuance of the alliance with France, which\r\nWolsey, recognising too late the fatal effects of the union with\r\nCharles, was seeking to make the basis of English policy, a French\r\nembassy arrived in England to conclude a marriage between Francis I.\r\nand the Princess Mary. At its head was Gabriel de Grammont, Bishop of\r\nTarbes; and in the course of his negotiations he is alleged to have\r\nfirst suggested those doubts of the validity of Henry's marriage,\r\nwhich ended in the divorce. The allegation was made by Wolsey three\r\nmonths later, and from that time down to our own day it has done duty\r\nwith Henry's apologists as a sufficient vindication of his conduct. It\r\nis now denounced as an impudent fiction, mainly on the ground that no\r\nhint of these doubts occurs in the extant records of the negotiations.\r\nBut unfortunately we have only one or two letters relating to this\r\ndiplomatic mission.[554] There exists, indeed, a detailed          (p. 196)\r\nnarrative, drawn up some time afterwards by Claude Dodieu, the French\r\nsecretary; but the silence, on so confidential a matter, of a third\r\nparty who was not present when the doubts were presumably suggested,\r\nproves little or nothing. Du Bellay, in 1528, reported to the French\r\nGovernment Henry's public assertion that Tarbes had mentioned these\r\ndoubts;[555] the statement was not repudiated; Tarbes himself believed\r\nin the validity of Henry's case and was frequently employed in efforts\r\nto win from the Pope an assent to Henry's divorce. It is rather a\r\nstrong assumption to suppose in the entire absence of positive\r\nevidence that Henry and Wolsey were deliberately lying. There is\r\nnothing impossible in the supposition that some such doubts were\r\nexpressed; indeed, Francis I. had every reason to encourage doubts of\r\nHenry's marriage as a means of creating a breach between him and\r\nCharles V. In return for Mary's hand, Henry was endeavouring to obtain\r\nvarious advantages from Francis in the way of pensions, tribute and\r\nterritory. Tarbes represented that the French King was so good a match\r\nfor the English princess, that there was little need for further\r\nconcession; to which Henry replied that Francis was no doubt an\r\nexcellent match for his daughter, but was he free to marry? His\r\nprecontract with Charles V.'s sister, Eleanor, was a complication\r\nwhich seriously diminished the value of Francis's offer; and the papal\r\ndispensation, which he hoped to obtain, might not be forthcoming   (p. 197)\r\nor valid.[556] As a counter to this stroke, Tarbes may well have\r\nhinted that the Princess Mary was not such a prize as Henry made out.\r\nWas the dispensation for Henry's own marriage beyond cavil? Was Mary's\r\nlegitimacy beyond question? Was her succession to the English throne,\r\na prospect Henry dangled before the Frenchman's eyes, so secure? These\r\nquestions were not very new, even at the time of Tarbes's mission. The\r\ndivorce had been talked about in 1514, and now, in 1527, the position\r\nof importance given to the Duke of Richmond was a matter of public\r\ncomment, and inevitably suggested doubts of Mary's succession. There\r\nis no documentary evidence that this argument was ever employed,\r\nbeyond the fact that, within three months of Tarbes's mission, both\r\nHenry and Wolsey asserted that the Bishop had suggested doubts of the\r\nvalidity of Henry's marriage.[557] Henry, however, does not say that\r\nTarbes _first_ suggested the doubts, nor does Wolsey. The Cardinal\r\ndeclares that the Bishop objected to the marriage with the Princess\r\nMary on the ground of these doubts; and some time later, when Henry\r\nexplained his position to the Lord-Mayor and aldermen of London, he\r\nsaid, according to Du Bellay, that the scruple of conscience, which he\r\nhad _long_ entertained, had terribly increased upon him since Tarbes\r\nhad spoken of it.[558]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 554: Dr. Gairdner (_Engl. Hist.

Shakespeare,\r\n                   following Cavendish (p. 221), makes Henry reveal\r\n                   his doubts first to his confessor, Bishop Longland\r\n                   of Lincoln: \"First I began in private with you, my\r\n                   Lord of Lincoln\" (\"Henry VIII.,\" Act II., sc. iv.);\r\n                   and there is contemporary authority for this\r\n                   belief. In 1532 Longland was said to have suggested\r\n                   a divorce to Henry ten years previously (_L. and\r\n                   P._, v., 1114), and Chapuys termed him \"the\r\n                   principal promoter of these practices\" (_ibid._,\r\n                   v., 1046); and in 1536 the northern rebels thought\r\n                   that he was the beginning of all the trouble\r\n                   (_ibid._, xi., 705); the same assertion is made in\r\n                   the anonymous \"Life and Death of Cranmer\" (_Narr.\r\n                   of the Reformation_, Camden Soc., p. 219). Other\r\n                   persons to whom the doubtful honour was ascribed\r\n                   are Wolsey and Stafileo, Dean of the Rota at Rome\r\n                   (_L. and P._, iv., 3400; _Sp. Cal._, iv., 159).]\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, before the Bishop's negotiations were         (p. 198)\r\ncompleted the first steps had been taken towards the divorce, or, as\r\nWolsey and Henry pretended, towards satisfying the King's scruples as\r\nto the validity of his marriage. Early in April, 1527, Dr. Richard\r\nWolman was sent down to Winchester to examine old Bishop Fox on the\r\nsubject.[559] The greatest secrecy was observed and none of the\r\nBishop's councillors were allowed to be present. Other evidence was\r\ndoubtless collected from various sources, and, on 17th May, a week\r\nafter Tarbes's departure, Wolsey summoned Henry to appear before him\r\nto explain his conduct in living with his brother's widow.[560] Wolman\r\nwas appointed promoter of the suit; Henry put in a justification,  (p. 199)\r\nand, on 31st May, Wolman replied. With that the proceedings terminated.\r\nIn instituting them Henry was following a precedent set by his\r\nbrother-in-law, the Duke of Suffolk.[561] In very early days that\r\nnobleman had contracted to marry Sir Anthony Browne's daughter, but\r\nfor some reason the match was broken off, and he sought the hand of\r\none Margaret Mortimer, to whom he was related in the second and third\r\ndegrees of consanguinity; he obtained a dispensation, completed the\r\nmarriage, and cohabited with Margaret Mortimer. But, like Henry VIII.,\r\nhis conscience or other considerations moved him to regard his\r\nmarriage as sin, and the dispensation as invalid. He caused a\r\ndeclaration to that effect to be made by \"the official of the\r\nArchdeacon of London, to whom the cognisance of such causes of old\r\nbelongs,\" married Ann Browne, and, after her death, Henry's sister\r\nMary. A marriage, the validity of which depended, like Henry's, upon a\r\npapal dispensation, and which, like Henry's, had been consummated, was\r\ndeclared null and void on exactly the same grounds as those upon which\r\nHenry himself sought a divorce, namely, the invalidity of the previous\r\ndispensation. On 12th May, 1528, Clement VII. issued a bull confirming\r\nSuffolk's divorce and pronouncing ecclesiastical censures on all who\r\ncalled in question the Duke's subsequent marriages. That is precisely\r\nthe course Henry wished to be followed. Wolsey was to declare the\r\nmarriage invalid on the ground of the insufficiency of the papal\r\ndispensation; Henry might then marry whom he pleased; the Pope was to\r\nconfirm the sentence, and censure all who should dispute the second\r\nmarriage or the legitimacy of its possible issue.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 559: _L. and P._, iv., 5291. This\r\n                   examination took place on 5th and 6th April.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 560: _Ibid._, iv., 3140.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 561: _L. and P._, iv., 5859; _cf._ iv.,\r\n                   737.]\r\n\r\nAnother precedent was also forced on Henry's mind. On 11th March,  (p. 200)\r\n1527, two months before Wolsey opened his court, a divorce was granted\r\nat Rome to Henry's sister Margaret, Queen of Scotland.[562] Her\r\npretexts were infinitely more flimsy than Henry's own. She alleged a\r\nprecontract on the part of her husband, Angus, which was never proved.\r\nShe professed to believe that James IV. had survived Flodden three\r\nyears, and was alive when she married Angus. Angus had been\r\nunfaithful, but that was no ground for divorce by canon law; and she\r\nherself was living in shameless adultery with Henry Stewart, who had\r\nalso procured a divorce to be free to marry his Queen. No objection\r\nwas found at Rome to either of these divorces; but neither Angus nor\r\nMargaret Mortimer had an Emperor for a nephew; no imperial armies\r\nwould march on Rome to vindicate the validity of their marriages, and\r\nClement could issue his bulls without any fear that their justice\r\nwould be challenged by the arms of powerful princes. Not so with\r\nHenry; while the secret proceedings before Wolsey were in progress,\r\nthe world was shocked by the sack of Rome, and Clement was a prisoner\r\nin the hands of the Emperor's troops. There was no hope that a Pope in\r\nsuch a plight would confirm a sentence to the detriment of his\r\nmaster's aunt. \"If the Pope,\" wrote Wolsey to Henry on receipt of the\r\nnews, \"be slain or taken, it will hinder the King's affairs not a\r\nlittle, which have hitherto been going on so well.\"[563] A little\r\nlater he declared that, if Catherine repudiated his authority, it\r\nwould be necessary to have the assent of the Pope or of the cardinals\r\nto the divorce. To obtain the former the Pope must be liberated; to\r\nsecure the latter the cardinals must be assembled in France.[564]  (p. 201)\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 562: _L. and P._, iv., 4130.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 563: _Ibid._, iv., 3147.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 564: _L. and P._, iv., 3311.]\r\n\r\nTo effect the Pope's liberation, or rather to call an assembly of\r\ncardinals in France during Clement's captivity, was the real object of\r\nthe mission to France, on which Wolsey started in July. Such a body,\r\nacting under Wolsey's presidency and in the territories of the French\r\nKing, was as likely to favour an attack upon the Emperor's aunt as the\r\nPope in the hands of Charles's armies was certain to oppose it. Wolsey\r\nwent in unparalleled splendour, not as Henry's ambassador but as his\r\nlieutenant; and projects for his own advancement were, as usual, part\r\nof the programme. Louise of Savoy, the queen-mother of France,\r\nsuggested to him that all Christian princes should repudiate the\r\nPope's authority so long as he remained in captivity, and the Cardinal\r\nreplied that, had the overture not been made by her, it would have\r\nbeen started by himself and by Henry.[565] It was rumoured in Spain\r\nthat Wolsey \"had gone into France to separate the Church of England\r\nand of France from the Roman, not merely during the captivity of the\r\nPope and to effect his liberation, but for a perpetual division,\"[566]\r\nand that Francis was offering Wolsey the patriarchate of the two\r\nschismatic churches. To win over the Cardinal to the interest of\r\nSpain, it was even suggested that Charles should depose Clement and\r\noffer the Papacy to Wolsey.[567] The project of a schism was not found\r\nfeasible; the cardinals at Rome were too numerous, and Wolsey only\r\nsucceeded in gaining four, three French and one Italian, to join him\r\nin signing a protest repudiating Clement's authority so long as    (p. 202)\r\nhe remained in the Emperor's power. It was necessary to fall back\r\nafter all on the Pope for assent to Henry's divorce, and the news that\r\nCharles had already got wind of the proceedings against Catherine made\r\nit advisable that no time should be lost. The Emperor, indeed, had\r\nlong been aware of Henry's intentions; every care had been taken to\r\nprevent communication between Catherine and her nephew, and a plot had\r\nbeen laid to kidnap a messenger she was sending in August to convey\r\nher appeal for protection. All was in vain, for the very day after\r\nWolsey's court had opened in May, Mendoza wrote to Charles that Wolsey\r\n\"as the finishing stroke to all his iniquities, had been scheming to\r\nbring about the Queen's divorce\"; and on the 29th of July, some days\r\nbefore Wolsey had any suspicion that a hint was abroad, Charles\r\ninformed Mendoza that he had despatched Cardinal Quignon to Rome, to\r\nact on the Queen's behalf and to persuade Clement to revoke Wolsey's\r\nlegatine powers.[568]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 565: _Ibid._, iv., 3247, 3263.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 566: _Ibid._, iv., 3291.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 567: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 273.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 568: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 193, 276, 300; _L.\r\n                   and P._, iv., 3312.]\r\n\r\nIn ignorance of all this, Wolsey urged Henry to send Ghinucci, the\r\nBishop of Worcester, and others to Rome with certain demands, among\r\nwhich was a request for Clement's assent to the abortive proposal for\r\na council in France.[569] But now a divergence became apparent between\r\nthe policy of Wolsey and that of his king. Both were working for a\r\ndivorce, but Wolsey wanted Henry to marry as his second wife Renee,\r\nthe daughter of Louis XII., and thus bind more closely the two kings,\r\nupon whose union the Cardinal's personal and political schemes were\r\nnow exclusively based. Henry, however, had determined that his     (p. 203)\r\nsecond wife was to be Anne Boleyn, and of this determination Wolsey\r\nwas as yet uninformed. The Cardinal had good reason to dread that\r\nlady's ascendancy over Henry's mind; for she was the hope and the tool\r\nof the anti-clerical party, which had hitherto been kept in check by\r\nWolsey's supremacy. The Duke of Norfolk was her uncle, and he was\r\nhostile to Wolsey for both private and public reasons; her father,\r\nViscount Rochford, her cousins, Sir William Fitzwilliam and Sir\r\nFrancis Brian, and many more distant connections, were anxious at the\r\nfirst opportunity to lead an attack on the Church and Cardinal. Before\r\nthe divorce case began Wolsey's position had grown precarious; taxes\r\nat home and failure abroad had turned the loyalty of the people to\r\nsullen discontent, and Wolsey was mainly responsible. \"Disaffection to\r\nthe King,\" wrote Mendoza in March, 1527, \"and hatred of the Legate are\r\nvisible everywhere.... The King would soon be obliged to change his\r\ncouncillors, were only a leader to present himself and head the\r\nmalcontents;\" and in May he reported a general rumour to the effect\r\nthat Henry intended to relieve the Legate of his share in the\r\nadministration.[570] The Cardinal had incurred the dislike of nearly\r\nevery section of the community; the King was his sole support and the\r\nKing was beginning to waver. In May there were high words between\r\nWolsey and Norfolk in Henry's presence;[571] in July King and Cardinal\r\nwere quarrelling over ecclesiastical patronage at Calais,[572] and,\r\nlong before the failure of the divorce suit, there were other      (p. 204)\r\nindications that Henry and his minister had ceased to work together in\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 569: _Ibid._, iv., 3400.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 570: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 109, 190, 192,\r\n                   193; _cf._ iv., 3951, Du Bellay to Montmorenci,\r\n                   \"those who desire to catch him tripping are very\r\n                   glad the people cry out 'Murder'\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 571: _L. and P._, iv., 1411.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 572: _Ibid._, iv., 3304.]\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, quite a mistake to represent Wolsey's failure to obtain\r\na sentence in Henry's favour as the sole or main cause of his fall.\r\nHad he succeeded, he might have deferred for a time his otherwise\r\nunavoidable ruin, but it was his last and only chance. He was driven\r\nto playing a desperate game, in which the dice were loaded against\r\nhim. If his plan failed, he told Clement over and over again, it would\r\nmean for him irretrievable ruin, and in his fall he would drag down\r\nthe Church. If it succeeded, he would be hardly more secure, for\r\nsuccess meant the predominance of Anne Boleyn and of her\r\nanti-ecclesiastical kin. Under the circumstances, it is possible to\r\nattach too much weight to the opinion of the French and Spanish\r\nambassadors, and of Charles V. himself, that Wolsey suggested the\r\ndivorce as the means of breaking for ever the alliance between England\r\nand the House of Burgundy, and substituting for it a union with\r\nFrance.[573] The divorce fitted in so well with Wolsey's French\r\npolicy, that the suspicion was natural; but the same observers also\r\nrecorded the impression that Wolsey was secretly opposing the divorce\r\nfrom fear of the ascendancy of Anne Boleyn.[574] That suspicion had\r\nbeen brought to Henry's mind as early as June, 1527. It was probably\r\ndue to the facts that Wolsey was not blinded by passion, as Henry was,\r\nto the difficulties in the way, and that it was he who persuaded Henry\r\nto have recourse to the Pope in the first instance,[575] when the\r\nKing desired to follow Suffolk's precedent, obtain a sentence      (p. 205)\r\nin England, marry again, and trust to the Pope to confirm his\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 573: _L. and P._, iv., 4112, 4865, 5512.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 574: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 432, 790; _Ven.\r\n                   Cal._, 1529, 212.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 575: \"He showed me,\" writes Campeggio,\r\n                   \"that in order to maintain and increase here the\r\n                   authority of the Holy See and the Pope he had done\r\n                   his utmost to persuade the King to apply for a\r\n                   legate... although many of these prelates declared\r\n                   it was possible to do without one\" (iv., 4857;\r\n                   _cf._ iv., 5072, 5177).]\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, impossible to trace Wolsey's real designs behind\r\nthese conflicting reports. He knew that Henry was determined to have a\r\ndivorce and that this was one of those occasions upon which \"he would\r\nbe obeyed, whosoever spoke to the contrary\". As minister he must\r\ntherefore either resign--a difficult thing in the sixteenth\r\ncentury--or carry out the King's policy. For his own part he had no\r\nobjection to the divorce in itself; he was no more touched by the\r\npathos of Catherine's fate than was her nephew Charles V., he wished\r\nto see the succession strengthened, he thought that he might restore\r\nhis tottering influence by obtaining gratification for the King, and\r\nhe was straining every nerve to weaken Charles V., either because the\r\nEmperor's power was really too great, or out of revenge for his\r\nbetrayal over the papal election. But he was strenuously hostile to\r\nHenry's marriage with Anne Boleyn for two excellent reasons: firstly\r\nshe and her kin belonged to the anti-ecclesiastical party which Wolsey\r\nhad dreaded since 1515, and secondly he desired Henry to marry the\r\nFrench Princess Renee in order to strengthen his anti-imperial policy.\r\nFurther, he was anxious that the divorce problem should be solved by\r\nmeans of the Papacy, because its solution by merely national action\r\nwould create a breach between England and Rome, would ruin Wolsey's\r\nchances of election as Pope, would threaten his ecclesiastical\r\nsupremacy in England, which was merely a legatine authority        (p. 206)\r\ndependent on the Pope,[576] and would throw Clement into the arms of\r\nCharles V., whereas Wolsey desired him to be an effective member of\r\nthe anti-imperial alliance. Thus Wolsey was prepared to go part of the\r\nway with Henry VIII., but he clearly saw the point at which their\r\npaths would diverge; and his efforts on Henry's behalf were hampered\r\nby his endeavours to keep the King on the track which he had marked\r\nout.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 576: Wolsey \"certainly proves himself\r\n                   very zealous for the preservation of the authority\r\n                   of the See Apostolic in this kingdom _because all\r\n                   his grandeur is connected with it_\" (Campeggio to\r\n                   Sanga, 28th Oct., 1528, _L. and P._, iv., 4881).]\r\n\r\nHenry's suspicions, and his knowledge that Wolsey would be hostile to\r\nhis marriage with Anne Boleyn, induced him to act for the time\r\nindependently of the Cardinal; and, while Wolsey was in France hinting\r\nat a marriage between Henry and Renee, the King himself was secretly\r\nendeavouring to remove the obstacles to his union with Anne Boleyn.\r\nInstead of adopting Wolsey's suggestion that Ghinucci should be sent\r\nto Rome as an Italian versed in the ways of the Papal Curia, he\r\ndespatched his secretary, Dr. William Knight, with two extraordinary\r\ncommissions, the second of which he thought would not be revealed \"for\r\nany craft the Cardinal or any other can find\".[577] The first was to\r\nobtain from the Pope a dispensation to marry a second wife, without\r\nbeing divorced from Catherine, the issue from both marriages to be\r\nlegitimate. This \"licence to commit bigamy\" has naturally been the\r\nsubject of much righteous indignation. But marriage-laws were lax  (p. 207)\r\nin those days, when Popes could play fast and loose with them for\r\npolitical purposes; and, besides the \"great reasons and precedents,\r\nespecially in the Old Testament,\" to which Henry referred,[578] he\r\nmight have produced a precedent more pertinent, more recent, and\r\nbetter calculated to appeal to Clement VII. In 1521 Charles V.'s\r\nSpanish council drew up a memorial on the subject of his marriage, in\r\nwhich they pointed out that his ancestor, Henry IV. of Castile, had,\r\nin 1437, married Dona Blanca, by whom he had no children; and that the\r\nPope thereupon granted him a dispensation to marry a second wife on\r\ncondition that, if within a fixed time he had no issue by her, he\r\nshould return to his first.[579] A licence for bigamy, modelled after\r\nthis precedent, would have suited Henry admirably, but apparently he\r\nwas unaware of this useful example, and was induced to countermand\r\nKnight's commission before it had been communicated to Clement. The\r\ndemand would not, however, have shocked the Pope so much as his modern\r\ndefenders, for on 18th September, 1530, Casale writes to Henry: \"A few\r\ndays since the Pope secretly proposed to me that your Majesty might be\r\nallowed two wives. I told him I could not undertake to make any such\r\nproposition, because I did not know whether it would satisfy your\r\nMajesty's conscience. I made this answer because I know that the\r\nImperialists have this in view, and are urging it; but why, I know\r\nnot.\"[580] Ghinucci and Benet were equally cautious, and thought the\r\nPope's suggestion was only a ruse; whether a ruse or not, it is    (p. 208)\r\na curious illustration of the moral influence Popes were then likely\r\nto exert on their flock.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 577: Henry VIII. to Knight in Corpus\r\n                   Christi College, Oxford, MS., 318, f. 3, printed in\r\n                   the _Academy_, xv., 239, and _Engl. Hist. Rev._,\r\n                   xi., 685.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 578: _L. and P._, iv., 4977.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 579: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 379.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 580: _L. and P._, iv., 6627, 6705, App.\r\n                   261.]\r\n\r\nThe second commission, with which Knight was entrusted, was hardly\r\nless strange than the first. By his illicit relations with Mary\r\nBoleyn, Henry had already contracted affinity in the first degree with\r\nher sister Anne, in fact precisely the same affinity (except that it\r\nwas illicit) as that which Catherine was alleged to have contracted\r\nwith him before their marriage. The inconsistency of Henry's conduct,\r\nin seeking to remove by the same method from his second marriage the\r\ndisability which was held to invalidate his first, helps us to define\r\nthe precise position which Henry took up and the nature of his\r\npeculiar conscience. Obviously he did not at this stage deny the\r\nPope's dispensing power; for he was invoking its aid to enable him to\r\nmarry Anne Boleyn. He asserted, and he denied, no principle whatever,\r\nthough it must be remembered that his own dispensation was an almost,\r\nif not quite, unprecedented stretch of papal power. To dispense with\r\nthe \"divine\" law against marrying the brother's wife, and to dispense\r\nwith the merely canonical obstacle to his marriage with Anne arising\r\nout of his relations with Mary Boleyn, were very different matters;\r\nand in this light the breach between England and Rome might be\r\nrepresented as caused by a novel extension of papal claims. Henry,\r\nhowever, was a casuist concerned exclusively with his own case. He\r\nmaintained merely that the particular dispensation, granted for his\r\nmarriage with Catherine, was null and void. As a concession to others,\r\nhe condescended to give a number of reasons, none of them affecting\r\nany principle, but only the legal technicalities of the case--the\r\ncauses for which the dispensation was granted, such as his own     (p. 209)\r\ndesire, and the political necessity for the marriage were fictitious;\r\nhe had himself protested against the marriage, and so forth. For\r\nhimself, his own conviction was ample sanction; he knew he was living\r\nin sin with Catherine because his children had all died but one, and\r\nthat was a manifest token of the wrath of Providence. The capacity for\r\nconvincing himself of his own righteousness is the most effective\r\nweapon in the egotist's armoury, and Henry's egotism touched the\r\nsublime. His conscience was clear, whatever other people might think\r\nof the maze of apparent inconsistencies in which he was involved. In\r\n1528 he was in some fear of death from the plague; fear of death is\r\nfatal to the peace of a guilty conscience, and it might well have made\r\nHenry pause in his pursuit after the divorce and Anne Boleyn. But\r\nHenry never wavered; he went on in serene assurance, writing his love\r\nletters to Anne, as a conscientiously unmarried man might do, making\r\nhis will,[581] \"confessing every day and receiving his Maker at every\r\nfeast,\"[582] paying great attention to the morals of monasteries, and\r\nto charges of malversation against Wolsey, and severely lecturing his\r\nsister Margaret on the sinfulness of her life.[583] He hopes she will\r\nturn \"to God's word, the vively doctrine of Jesu Christ, the only\r\nground of salvation--1 COR. 3, etc.\"; he reminds her of \"the divine\r\nordinance of inseparable matrimony first instituted in Paradise,\" and\r\nurges her to avoid \"the inevitable damnation threatened against    (p. 210)\r\nadvoutrers\". Henry's conscience was convenient and skilful. He\r\nbelieved in the \"ordinance of inseparable matrimony,\" so, when he\r\nwished to divorce a wife, his conscience warned him that he had never\r\nreally been married to her. Hence his nullity suits with Catherine of\r\nAragon, with Anne Boleyn and with Anne of Cleves. Moreover, if he had\r\nnever been married to Catherine, his relations with Mary Boleyn and\r\nElizabeth Blount were obviously not adultery, and he was free to\r\ndenounce that sin in Margaret with a clear conscience.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 581: _L. and P._, iv., 4404.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 582: _Ibid._, iv., 4542.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 583: _Ibid._, iv., 4131.

So Knight returned to the Papal\r\nCourt; and then began that struggle between English and Spanish    (p. 211)\r\ninfluence at Rome which ended in the victory of Charles V. and the\r\nrepudiation by England of the Roman jurisdiction. Never did two\r\nparties enter upon a contest with a clearer perception of the issues\r\ninvolved, or carry it on with their eyes more open to the magnitude of\r\nthe results. Wolsey himself, Gardiner, Foxe, Casale, and every English\r\nenvoy employed in the case, warned and threatened Clement that, if he\r\nrefused Henry's demands, he would involve Wolsey and the Papal cause\r\nin England in a common ruin. \"He alleged,\" says Campeggio of Wolsey,\r\n\"that if the King's desire were not complied with... there would\r\nfollow the speedy and total ruin of the kingdom, of his Lordship and\r\nof the Church's influence in this kingdom.\"[585] \"I cannot reflect\r\nupon it,\" wrote Wolsey himself, \"and close my eyes, for I see ruin,\r\ninfamy and subversion of the whole dignity and estimation of the See\r\nApostolic if this course is persisted in. You see in what dangerous\r\ntimes we are. If the Pope will consider the gravity of this cause, and\r\nhow much the safety of the nation depends upon it, he will see that\r\nthe course he now pursues will drive the King to adopt remedies which\r\nare injurious to the Pope, and are frequently instilled into the\r\nKing's mind.\"[586] On one occasion Clement confessed that, though the\r\nPope was supposed to carry the papal laws locked up in his breast,\r\nProvidence had not vouchsafed him the key wherewith to unlock them;\r\nand Gardiner roughly asked in retort whether in that case the papal\r\nlaws should not be committed to the flames.[587] He told how the\r\nLutherans were instigating Henry to do away with the temporal      (p. 212)\r\npossessions of the Church.[588] But Clement could only bewail his\r\nmisfortune, and protest that, if heresies and schisms arose, it was\r\nnot his fault. He could not afford to offend the all-powerful Emperor;\r\nthe sack of Rome and Charles's intimation conveyed in plain and set\r\nterms that it was the judgment of God[589] had cowed Clement for the\r\nrest of his life, and made him resolve never again to incur the\r\nEmperor's enmity.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 584: For these intricate negotiations see\r\n                   Stephan Ehses, _Roemische Dokumente zur Geschichte\r\n                   der Ehescheidung Heinrichs VIII. von England_,\r\n                   1893; these documents had all, I think, been\r\n                   previously printed by Laemmer or Theiner, but only\r\n                   from imperfect copies often incorrectly deciphered.\r\n                   Ehses has printed the originals with the utmost\r\n                   care, and thrown much new light on the subject.

Cal._, iii., 309.]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of justice, the Pope had an excellent case;\r\neven the Lutherans, who denied his dispensing power, denounced the\r\ndivorce. _Quod non fieri debuit_, was their just and common-sense\r\npoint, _factum valet_. But the Pope's case had been hopelessly\r\nweakened by the evil practice of his predecessors and of himself.\r\nAlexander VI. had divorced Louis XII. from his Queen for no other\r\nreasons than that Louis XII. wanted to unite Brittany with France by\r\nmarrying its duchess, and that Alexander, the Borgia Pope, required\r\nLouis' assistance in promoting the interests of the iniquitous Borgia\r\nfamily.[590] The injustice to Catherine was no greater than that to\r\nLouis' Queen. Henry's sister Margaret, and both the husbands of his\r\nother sister, Mary, had procured divorces from Popes, and why not\r\nHenry himself? Clement was ready enough to grant Margaret's\r\ndivorce;[591] he was willing to give a dispensation for a marriage\r\nbetween the Princess Mary and her half-brother, the Duke of        (p. 213)\r\nRichmond; the more insuperable the obstacle, the more its removal\r\nenhanced his power. It was all very well to dispense with canons and\r\ndivine laws, but to annul papal dispensations--was that not to cheapen\r\nhis own wares? Why, wrote Henry to Clement, could he not dispense with\r\nhuman laws, if he was able to dispense with divine at pleasure?[592]\r\nObviously because divine authority could take care of itself, but papal\r\nprerogatives needed a careful shepherd. Even this principle, such as\r\nit was, was not consistently followed, for he had annulled a dispensation\r\nin Suffolk's case. Clement's real anxiety was to avoid responsibility.\r\nMore than once he urged Henry to settle the matter himself,[593] as\r\nSuffolk had done, obtain a sentence from the courts in England, and\r\nmarry his second wife. The case could then only come before him as a\r\nsuit against the validity of the second marriage, and the accomplished\r\nfact was always a powerful argument. Moreover, all this would take\r\ntime, and delay was as dear to Clement as irresponsibility. But Henry\r\nwas determined to have such a sentence as would preclude all doubts of\r\nthe legitimacy of his children by the second marriage, and was as\r\nanxious to shift the responsibility to Clement's shoulders as the Pope\r\nwas to avoid it. Clement next urged Catherine to go into a nunnery,\r\nfor that would only entail injustice on herself, and would involve the\r\nChurch and its head in no temporal perils.[594] When Catherine     (p. 214)\r\nrefused, he wished her in the grave, and lamented that he seemed\r\ndoomed through her to lose the spiritualties of his Church, as he had\r\nlost its temporalties through her nephew, Charles V.[595]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 590: _L. and P._, iv., 5152, where\r\n                   Henry's ambassadors quote this precedent to the\r\n                   Pope. _Cf. ibid._, v., 45, for other precedents.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 591: The sentence was actually pronounced\r\n                   by the Cardinal of Ancona, and the date was 11th\r\n                   March, 1527, just before Henry commenced\r\n                   proceedings against Catherine. Henry called it a\r\n                   \"shameless sentence\"; but it may nevertheless have\r\n                   suggested to his mind the possibility of obtaining\r\n                   one like it.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 592: _L. and P._, iv., 5966.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 593: _Ibid._, iv., 3802, 6290.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 594: _Ibid._, iv., 5072. \"It would\r\n                   greatly please the Pope,\" writes his secretary\r\n                   Sanga, \"if the Queen could be induced to enter some\r\n                   religion, because, although this course would be\r\n                   portentous and unusual, he could more readily\r\n                   entertain the idea, _as it would involve the injury\r\n                   of only one person_.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 595: _L. and P._, iv., 5518.]\r\n\r\nIt was thus with the utmost reluctance that he granted the commission\r\nbrought by Knight. It was a draft, drawn up by Wolsey, apparently\r\ndeclaring the law on the matter and empowering Wolsey, if the facts\r\nwere found to be such as were alleged, to pronounce the nullity of\r\nCatherine's marriage.[596] Wolsey desired that it should be granted in\r\nthe form in which he had drawn it up. But the Pope's advisers declared\r\nthat such a commission would disgrace Henry, Wolsey and Clement\r\nhimself. The draft was therefore amended so as to be unobjectionable,\r\nor, in other words, useless for practical purposes; and, with this\r\ncommission, Knight returned to England, rejoicing in the confidence of\r\ncomplete success. But, as soon as Wolsey had seen it, he pronounced\r\nthe commission \"as good as none at all\".[597] The discovery did not\r\nimprove his or Henry's opinion of the Pope's good faith; but, dissembling\r\ntheir resentment, they despatched, in February, 1528, Stephen Gardiner\r\nand Edward Foxe to obtain fresh and more effective powers. Eventually,\r\non 8th June a commission was issued to Wolsey and Campeggio to try the\r\ncase and pronounce sentence;[598] even if one was unwilling, the other\r\nmight act by himself; and all appeals from their jurisdiction      (p. 215)\r\nwere forbidden. This was not a decretal commission; it did not bind\r\nthe Pope or prevent him from revoking the case. Such a commission was,\r\nhowever, granted on condition that it should be shown to no one but\r\nthe King and Wolsey, and that it should not be used in the procedure.\r\nThe Pope also gave a written promise, in spite of a protest lodged on\r\nCatherine's behalf by the Spanish ambassador, Muxetula,[599] that he\r\nwould not revoke, or do anything to invalidate, the commission, but\r\nwould confirm the cardinals' decision.[600] If, Clement had said in\r\nthe previous December, Lautrec, the French commander in Italy, came\r\nnearer Rome, he might excuse himself to the Emperor as having acted\r\nunder pressure.[601] He would send the commission as soon as Lautrec\r\narrived. Lautrec had now arrived; he had marched down through Italy;\r\nhe had captured Melfi; the Spanish commander, Moncada, had been\r\nkilled; Naples was thought to be on the eve of surrender.[602] The\r\nSpanish dominion in Italy was waning, the Emperor's thunderbolts were\r\nless terrifying, and the justice of the cause of his aunt less\r\napparent.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 596: It was called a \"decretal\r\n                   commission,\" and it was a legislative as well as an\r\n                   administrative act; the Pope being an absolute\r\n                   monarch, his decrees were the laws of the Church;\r\n                   the difficulties of Clement VII. and indeed the\r\n                   whole divorce question could never have arisen had\r\n                   the Church been a constitutional monarchy.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 597: _L. and P._, iv., 3913.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 598: _Ibid._, iv., 4345.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 599: _Engl.

Henry congratulated himself\r\nthat his hopes were on the eve of fulfilment. But, unfortunately for\r\nhim, the basis, on which they were built, was as unstable as water.\r\nThe decision of his case still depended upon Clement, and Clement\r\nwavered with every fluctuation in the success or the failure of    (p. 216)\r\nthe Spanish arms in Italy. Campeggio had scarcely set out, when\r\nDoria, the famous Genoese admiral, deserted Francis for Charles;[604]\r\non the 17th of August Lautrec died before Naples;[605] and, on 10th\r\nSeptember, an English agent sent Wolsey news of a French disaster,\r\nwhich he thought more serious than the battle of Pavia or the sack of\r\nRome.[606] On the following day Sanga, the Pope's secretary, wrote to\r\nCampeggio that, \"as the Emperor is victorious, the Pope must not give\r\nhim any pretext for a fresh rupture, lest the Church should be utterly\r\nannihilated.... Proceed on your journey to England, and there do your\r\nutmost to restore mutual affection between the King and Queen. You are\r\nnot to pronounce any opinion without a new and express commission\r\nhence.\"[607] Sanga repeated the injunction a few days later. \"Every\r\nday,\" he wrote, \"stronger reasons are discovered;\" to satisfy Henry\r\n\"involves the certain ruin of the Apostolic See and the Church, owing\r\nto recent events.... If so great an injury be done to the Emperor...\r\nthe Church cannot escape utter ruin, as it is entirely in the power of\r\nthe Emperor's servants. You will not, therefore, be surprised at my\r\nrepeating that you are not to proceed to sentence, under any pretext,\r\nwithout express commission; but to protract the matter as long as\r\npossible.\"[608] Clement himself wrote to Charles that nothing would be\r\ndone to Catherine's detriment, that Campeggio had gone merely to urge\r\nHenry to do his duty, and that the whole case would eventually be\r\nreferred to Rome.[609] Such were the secret instructions with which\r\nCampeggio arrived in England in October.[610] He readily promised  (p. 217)\r\nnot to proceed to sentence, but protested against the interpretation\r\nwhich he put upon the Pope's command, namely, that he was not to begin\r\nthe trial. The English, he said, \"would think that I had come to\r\nhoodwink them, and might resent it. You know how much that would\r\ninvolve.\"[611] He did not seem to realise that the refusal to pass\r\nsentence was equally hoodwinking the English, and that the trial would\r\nonly defer the moment of their penetrating the deception; a trial was\r\nof no use without sentence.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 603: _Ibid._, iv., 4605.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 604: _L. and P._, iv., 4626.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 605: _Ibid._, iv., 4663.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 606: _Ibid._, iv., 4713.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 607: _Ibid._, iv., 4721.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 608: _Ibid._, iv., 4736-37.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 609: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 779.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 610: _L. and P._, iv., 4857.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 611: _Ibid._, iv., 4736.]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his instructions, Campeggio first sought to dissuade\r\nHenry from persisting in his suit for the divorce. Finding the King\r\nimmovable, he endeavoured to induce Catherine to go into a nunnery, as\r\nthe divorced wife of Louis XII. had done, \"who still lived in the\r\ngreatest honour and reputation with God and all that kingdom\".[612] He\r\nrepresented to her that she had nothing to lose by such a step; she\r\ncould never regain Henry's affections or obtain restitution of her\r\nconjugal rights. Her consent might have deferred the separation of the\r\nEnglish Church from Rome; it would certainly have relieved the Supreme\r\nPontiff from a humiliating and intolerable position. But these\r\nconsiderations of expediency weighed nothing with Catherine. She was\r\nas immovable as Henry, and deaf to all Campeggio's solicitations. Her\r\nconscience was, perhaps, of a rigid, Spanish type, but it was as clear\r\nas Henry's and a great deal more comprehensible. She was convinced\r\nthat her marriage was valid; to admit a doubt of it would imply that\r\nshe had been living in sin and imperil her immortal soul. Henry    (p. 218)\r\ndid not in the least mind admitting that he had lived for twenty years\r\nwith a woman who was not his wife; the sin, to his mind, was continuing\r\nto live with her after he had become convinced that she was really not\r\nhis wife. Catherine appears, however, to have been willing to take the\r\nmonastic vows, if Henry would do the same. Henry was equally willing,\r\nif Clement would immediately dispense with the vows in his case, but\r\nnot in Catherine's.[613] But there were objections to this course, and\r\ndoubts of Clement's power to authorise Henry's re-marriage, even if\r\nCatherine did go into a nunnery.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 612: _Ibid._, iv., 4858.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 613: _L. and P._, iv., 4977.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Campeggio found help from an unexpected quarter in his\r\nefforts to waste the time. Quite unknown to Henry, Wolsey, or Clement,\r\nthere existed in Spain a brief of Julius II. fuller than the original\r\nbull of dispensation which he had granted for the marriage of Henry\r\nand Catherine, and supplying any defects that might be found in it.\r\nIndeed, so conveniently did the brief meet the criticisms urged\r\nagainst the bull, that Henry and Wolsey at once pronounced it an\r\nobvious forgery, concocted after the doubts about the bull had been\r\nraised. No copy of the brief could be found in the English archives,\r\nnor could any trace be discovered of its having been registered at\r\nRome; while Ghinucci and Lee, who examined the original in Spain,\r\nprofessed to see in it such flagrant inaccuracies as to deprive it of\r\nall claim to be genuine.[614] Still, if it were genuine, it shattered\r\nthe whole of Henry's case. That had been built up, not on the      (p. 219)\r\ndenial of the Pope's power to dispense, but on the technical defects\r\nof a particular dispensation. Now it appeared that the validity of the\r\nmarriage did not depend upon this dispensation at all. Nor did it\r\ndepend upon the brief, for Catherine was prepared to deny on oath that\r\nthe marriage with Arthur had been anything more than a form;[615] in\r\nthat case the affinity with Henry had not been contracted, and there\r\nwas no need of either dispensation or brief. This assertion seems to\r\nhave shaken Henry; certainly he began to shift his position, and,\r\nearly in 1529, he was wishing for some noted divine, friar or other,\r\nwho would maintain that the Pope could not dispense at all.[616] This\r\nwas his first doubt as to the plenitude of papal power; his marriage\r\nwith Catherine must be invalid, because his conscience told him so; if\r\nit was not invalid through defects in the dispensation, it must be\r\ninvalid because the Pope could not dispense. Wolsey met the objection\r\nwith a legal point, perfectly good in itself, but trivial. There were\r\ntwo canonical disabilities which the dispensation must meet for\r\nHenry's marriage to be valid; first, the consummation of Catherine's\r\nmarriage with Arthur; secondly, the marriage, even though it was not\r\nconsummated, was yet celebrated _in facie ecclesiae_, and generally\r\nreputed complete. There was thus an _impedimentum publicae honestatis_\r\nto the marriage of Henry and Catherine, and this impediment was not\r\nmentioned in, and therefore not removed by, the dispensation.[617]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 614: _Ibid._, iv., 5376-77, 5470-71,\r\n                   5486-87. For the arguments as to its validity see\r\n                   Busch, _England under the Tudors_, Eng. trs., i.,\r\n                   376-8; Friedmann, _Anne Boleyn_, ii., 329; and Lord\r\n                   Acton in the _Quarterly Rev._, cxliii., 1-51.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 615: She made this statement to Campeggio\r\n                   in the confessional (_L. and P._, iv., 4875).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 616: _Ibid._, iv., 5377, 5438; _Sp.\r\n                   Cal._, iii., 276, 327.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 617: _L. and P._, iv., 3217. See this\r\n                   point discussed in Taunton's _Cardinal Wolsey_,\r\n                   chap. x.]\r\n\r\nBut all this legal argument might be invalidated by the brief.     (p. 220)\r\nIt was useless to proceed with the trial until the promoters of the\r\nsuit knew what the brief contained. According to Mendoza, Catherine's\r\n\"whole right\" depended upon the brief, a statement indicating a\r\ngeneral suspicion that the bull was really insufficient.[618] So the\r\nwinter of 1528-29 and the following spring were spent in efforts to\r\nget hold of the original brief, or to induce Clement to declare it a\r\nforgery. The Queen was made to write to Charles that it was absolutely\r\nessential to her case that the brief should be produced before the\r\nlegatine Court in England.[619] The Emperor was not likely to be\r\ncaught by so transparent an artifice. Moreover, the emissary, sent\r\nwith Catherine's letter, wrote, as soon as he got to France, warning\r\nCharles that his aunt's letter was written under compulsion and\r\nexpressed the reverse of her real desires.[620] In the spring of 1529\r\nseveral English envoys, ending with Gardiner, were sent to Rome to\r\nobtain a papal declaration of the falsity of the brief. Clement,\r\nhowever, naturally refused to declare the brief a forgery, without\r\nhearing the arguments on the other side,[621] and more important\r\ndevelopments soon supervened. Gardiner wrote from Rome, early in May,\r\nthat there was imminent danger of the Pope revoking the case, and  (p. 221)\r\nthe news determined Henry and Wolsey to relinquish their suit about\r\nthe brief, and push on the proceedings of the legatine Court, so as to\r\nget some decision before the case was called to Rome. Once the legates\r\nhad pronounced in favour of the divorce, Clement was informed, the\r\nEnglish cared little what further fortunes befel it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 618: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 882.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 619: _L. and P._, iv., 4841.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 620: _Ibid._, iv., 5154, 5177, 5211\r\n                   (ii.); _Sp.

Yet there is\r\n                   a letter from Clement to Campeggio (_Cotton MS._,\r\n                   Vitellius, B, xii., 164; _L. and P._, iv., 5181)\r\n                   authorising him \"to reject whatever evidence is\r\n                   tendered in behalf of this brief as an evident\r\n                   forgery\". Clement was no believer in the maxim _qui\r\n                   facit per alium facit per se_; he did not mind what\r\n                   his legates did, so long as he was free to\r\n                   repudiate their action when convenient.]\r\n\r\nSo, on the 31st of May, 1529, in the great hall of the Black Friars,\r\nin London, the famous Court was formally opened, and the King and\r\nQueen were cited to appear before it on the 18th of June.[622] Henry\r\nwas then represented by two proxies, but Catherine came in person to\r\nprotest against the competence of the tribunal.[623] Three days later\r\nboth the King and the Queen attended in person to hear the Court's\r\ndecision on this point. Catherine threw herself on her knees before\r\nHenry; she begged him to consider her honour, her daughter's and his.\r\nTwice Henry raised her up; he protested that he desired nothing so\r\nmuch as that their marriage should be found valid, in spite of the\r\n\"perpetual scruple\" he had felt about it, and declared that only his\r\nlove for her had kept him silent so long; her request for the removal\r\nof the cause to Rome was unreasonable, considering the Emperor's power\r\nthere. Again protesting against the jurisdiction of the Court and\r\nappealing to Rome, Catherine withdrew. Touched by her appeal, Henry\r\nburst out in her praise. \"She is, my Lords,\" he said, \"as true, as\r\nobedient, and as conformable a wife, as I could, in my phantasy, wish\r\nor desire. She hath all the virtuous qualities that ought to be in a\r\nwoman of her dignity, or in any other of baser estate.\"[624]       (p. 222)\r\nBut these qualities had nothing to do with the pitiless forms of law.\r\nThe legate, overruled her protest, refused her appeal, and summoned\r\nher back. She took no notice, and was declared contumacious.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 622: _L. and P._, iv., 5611, 5612.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 623: _Ibid._, iv., 5685, 5694, 5695,\r\n                   5702.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 624: _L. and P._, iv., Introd., p.\r\n                   cccclxxv.]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings then went on without her; Fisher Bishop of Rochester,\r\nmade a courageous defence of the validity of the marriage, to which\r\nHenry drew up a bitter reply in the form of a speech addressed to the\r\nlegates.[625] The speed with which the procedure was hurried on was\r\nlittle to Campeggio's taste. He had not prejudged the case; he was\r\nstill in doubt as to which way the sentence would go; and he entered a\r\ndignified protest against the orders he received from Rome to give\r\nsentence, if it came to that point, against Henry.[626] He would\r\npronounce what judgment seemed to him just, but he shrank from the\r\nordeal, and he did his best to follow out Clement's injunctions to\r\nprocrastinate.[627] In this he succeeded completely. It seemed that\r\njudgment could no longer be deferred; it was to be delivered on the\r\n23rd of July.[628] On that day the King himself, and the chief men of\r\nhis Court, were present; his proctor demanded sentence. Campeggio\r\nstood up, and instead of giving sentence, adjourned the Court till\r\nOctober.[629] \"By the mass!\" burst out Suffolk, giving the table   (p. 223)\r\na great blow with his hand, \"now I see that the old-said saw is true,\r\nthat there was never a legate nor cardinal that did good in England.\"\r\nThe Court never met again; and except during the transient reaction,\r\nunder Mary, it was the last legatine Court ever held in England. They\r\nmight assure the Pope, Wolsey had written to the English envoys at\r\nRome a month before, that if he granted the revocation he would lose\r\nthe devotion of the King and of England to the See Apostolic, and\r\nutterly destroy Wolsey for ever.[630]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 625: _Ibid._, iv., Introd., p. cccclxxix.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 626: _Ibid._, iv., 5732, 5734.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 627: _Ibid._, iv., 3604.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 628: _Ibid._, iv., 5789.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 629: It was alleged that this adjournment\r\n                   was only the usual practice of the curia; but it is\r\n                   worth noting that in 1530 Charles V. asserted that\r\n                   it was usual to carry on matters so important as\r\n                   the divorce during vacation (_ibid._, iv., 6452),\r\n                   and that Clement had repeatedly ordered Campeggio\r\n                   to prolong the suit as much as possible and above\r\n                   all to pronounce no sentence.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 630: _L. and P._, iv., 5703, 5715, 5780.]\r\n\r\nLong before the vacation was ended, news reached Henry that the case\r\nhad been called to Rome; the revocation was, indeed, decreed a week\r\nbefore Campeggio adjourned his court. Charles's star, once more in the\r\nascendant, had cast its baleful influence over Henry's fortunes. The\r\nclose alliance between England and France had led to a joint\r\ndeclaration of war on the Emperor in January, 1528, into which the\r\nEnglish ambassadors in Spain had been inveigled by their French\r\ncolleagues, against Henry's wishes.[631] It was received with a storm\r\nof opposition in England, and Wolsey had some difficulty in justifying\r\nhimself to the King. \"You may be sure,\" wrote Du Bellay, \"that he is\r\nplaying a terrible game, for I believe he is the only Englishman who\r\nwishes a war with Flanders.\"[632] If that was his wish, he was doomed\r\nto disappointment. Popular hatred of the war was too strong; a project\r\nwas mooted by the clothiers in Kent for seizing the Cardinal and\r\nturning him adrift in a boat, with holes bored in it.[633] The     (p. 224)\r\nclothiers in Wiltshire were reported to be rising; in Norfolk\r\nemployers dismissed their workmen.[634] War with Flanders meant ruin\r\nto the most prosperous industry in both countries, and the attempt to\r\ndivert the Flanders trade to Calais had failed.[635] So Henry and\r\nCharles were soon discussing peace; no hostilities took place; an\r\nagreement, that trade should go on as usual with Flanders,[636] was\r\nfollowed by a truce in June,[637] and the truce by the Peace of\r\nCambrai in the following year. That peace affords the measure of\r\nEngland's decline since 1521. Wolsey was carefully excluded from all\r\nshare in the negotiations. England was, indeed, admitted as a\r\nparticipator, but only after Louise and Margaret of Savoy had\r\npractically settled the terms, and after Du Bellay had told Francis\r\nthat, if England were not admitted, it would mean Wolsey's immediate\r\nruin.[638]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 631: _Ibid._, iv., 4564; _Sp.

His\r\naffairs beyond the Alps had been going from bad to worse since the\r\ndeath of Lautrec; and the suggested guard of French and English\r\nsoldiers which was to relieve the Pope from fear of Charles was never\r\nformed.[639] That failure was not the only circumstance which made\r\nClement imperialist. Venice, the ally of England and France, seized\r\nRavenna and Cervia, two papal towns.[640] \"The conduct of the\r\nVenetians,\" wrote John Casale from Rome, \"moves the Pope more than\r\nanything else, and he would use the assistance of any one, except  (p. 225)\r\nthe Devil, to avenge their injury.\"[641] \"The King and the Cardinal,\"\r\nrepeated Sanga to Campeggio, \"must not expect him to execute his\r\nintentions, until they have used their utmost efforts to compel the\r\nVenetians to restore the Pope's territories.\"[642] Henry did his best,\r\nbut he was not sincerely helped by Francis; his efforts proved vain,\r\nand Clement thought he could get more effective assistance from\r\nCharles. \"Every one is persuaded,\" said one of the Emperor's agents in\r\nItaly on 10th January, 1529, \"that the Pope is now sincerely attached\r\nto his Imperial Majesty.\"[643] \"I suspect,\" wrote Du Bellay from\r\nLondon, in the same month, \"that the Pope has commanded Campeggio to\r\nmeddle no further, seeing things are taking quite a different turn\r\nfrom what he had been assured, and that the Emperor's affairs in\r\nNaples are in such a state that Clement dare not displease him.\"[644]\r\nThe Pope had already informed Charles that his aunt's petition for the\r\nrevocation of the suit would be granted.[645] The Italian League was\r\npractically dissolved. \"I have quite made up my mind,\" said Clement to\r\nthe Archbishop of Capua on 7th June, \"to become an Imperialist, and to\r\nlive and die as such... I am only waiting for the return of my\r\nnuncio.\"[646]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 639: _Ibid._, iv., 5179.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 640: _Ibid._, iv., 4680-84.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 641: _L. and P._, iv., 4900.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 642: _Ibid._, iv., 5447.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 643: _Sp.

The revocation was only delayed, thought\r\nCharles's representative at Rome, to secure better terms for the\r\nPope.[647] On 21st June, the French commander, St. Pol, was utterly\r\ndefeated at Landriano; \"not a vestige of the army is left,\"        (p. 226)\r\nreported Casale.[648] A few days later the Treaty of Barcelona between\r\nClement and Charles was signed.[649] Clement's nephew was to marry the\r\nEmperor's natural daughter; the Medici tyranny was to be re-established\r\nin Florence; Ravenna, Cervia and other towns were to be restored to\r\nthe Pope; His Holiness was to crown Charles with the imperial crown,\r\nand to absolve from ecclesiastical censures all those who were present\r\nat, or consented to, the sack of Rome. It was, in effect, a family\r\ncompact; and part of it was the quashing of the legates' proceedings\r\nagainst the Emperor's aunt, with whom the Pope was now to be allied by\r\nfamily ties. \"We found out secretly,\" write the English envoys at\r\nRome, on the 16th of July, \"that the Pope signed the revocation\r\nyesterday morning, as it would have been dishonourable to have signed\r\nit after the publication of the new treaty with the Emperor, which\r\nwill be published here on Sunday.\"[650] Clement knew that his motives\r\nwould not bear scrutiny, and he tried to avoid public odium by a\r\ncharacteristic subterfuge. Catherine could hope for no justice in\r\nEngland, Henry could expect no justice at Rome. Political expediency\r\nwould dictate a verdict in Henry's favour in England; political\r\nexpediency would dictate a verdict for Catherine at Rome. Henry's\r\nambassadors were instructed to appeal from Clement to the \"true Vicar\r\nof Christ,\" but where was the true Vicar of Christ to be found on  (p. 227)\r\nearth?[651] There was no higher tribunal. It was intolerable that\r\nEnglish suits should be decided by the chances and changes of French\r\nor Habsburg influence in Italy, by the hopes and the fears of an\r\nItalian prince for the safety of his temporal power. The natural and\r\ninevitable result was the separation of England from Rome.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 647: _Ibid._, iv., 154.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 648: _L. and P._, iv., 5705, 5767; _cf.\r\n                   Sp.

Another detail was the excommunication of\r\n                   Zapolya, the rival of the Habsburgs in Hungary--a\r\n                   step which Henry VIII. denounced as \"letting the\r\n                   Turk into Hungary\" (_L. and P._, v., 274).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 651: _L. and P._, iv., 5650, 5715.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.                                                        (p. 228)\r\n\r\nTHE CARDINAL'S FALL.[652]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 652: See, besides the documents cited,\r\n                   Busch, _Der Sturz des Cardinals Wolsey_ (Hist.\r\n                   Taschenbuch, VI., ix., 39-114).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loss of their spiritual jurisdiction in England was part of the\r\nprice paid by the Popes for their temporal possessions in Italy. The\r\npapal domains were either too great or too small. If the Pope was to\r\nrely on his temporal power, it should have been extensive enough to\r\nprotect him from the dictation and resentment of secular princes; and\r\nfrom this point of view there was no little justification for the aims\r\nof Julius II. Had he succeeded in driving the barbarians across the\r\nAlps or into the sea, he and his successors might in safety have\r\njudged the world, and the breach with Henry might never have taken\r\nplace. If the Pope was to rely on his spiritual weapons, there was no\r\nneed of temporal states at all. In their existing extent and position,\r\nthey were simply the heel of Achilles, the vulnerable spot, through\r\nwhich secular foes might wound the Vicar of Christ. France threatened\r\nhim from the north and Spain from the south; he was ever between the\r\nupper and the nether mill-stone. Italy was the cockpit of Europe in\r\nthe sixteenth century, and the eyes of the Popes were perpetually bent\r\non the worldly fray, seeking to save or extend their dominions.\r\nThrough the Pope's temporal power, France and Spain exerted their  (p. 229)\r\npressure. He could only defend himself by playing off one against the\r\nother, and in this game his spiritual powers were his only effective\r\npieces. More and more the spiritual authority, with which he was\r\nentrusted, was made to serve political ends. Temporal princes were\r\nbranded as \"sons of iniquity and children of perdition,\" not because\r\ntheir beliefs or their morals were worse than other men's, but because\r\nthey stood in the way of the family ambitions of various popes. Their\r\nfrequent use and abuse brought ecclesiastical censures into public\r\ncontempt, and princes soon ceased to be frightened with false fires.\r\nJames IV., when excommunicated, said he would appeal to Prester John,\r\nand that he would side with any council against the Pope, even if it\r\ncontained only three bishops.[653] The Vicar of Christ was lost in the\r\npetty Italian prince. _Corruptio optimi pessima_. The lower dragged\r\nthe higher nature down. If the Papal Court was distinguished from the\r\ncourts of other Italian sovereigns, it was not by exceptional purity.\r\n\"In this Court as in others,\" wrote Silvester de Giglis from Rome,\r\n\"nothing can be effected without gifts.\"[654] The election of Leo X.\r\nwas said to be free from bribery; a cardinal himself was amazed, and\r\ndescribed the event as _Phoenix et rara avis_.[655] If poison was not\r\na frequent weapon at Rome, popes and cardinals at least believed it to\r\nbe. Alexander VI. was said to have been poisoned; one cardinal was\r\naccused of poisoning his fellow-cardinal, Bainbridge; and others were\r\ncharged with an attempt on the life of Leo X.[656] In 1517, Pace   (p. 230)\r\ndescribed the state of affairs at Rome as _plane monstra, omni\r\ndedecore et infamia plena; omnis fides, omnis honestas, una cum\r\nreligione, a mundo abvolasse videntur_.[657] Ten years later, the\r\nEmperor himself declared that the sack of Rome was the just judgment\r\nof God, and one of his ambassadors said that the Pope ought to be\r\ndeprived of his temporal states, as they had been at the bottom of all\r\nthe dissensions.[658] Clement himself claimed to have been the\r\noriginator of that war which brought upon him so terrible and so just\r\na punishment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 653: _L. and P._, i., 3838, 3876.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 654: _Ibid._, ii., 3781; _cf._, i., 4283,\r\n                   \"all here have regard only to their own honour and\r\n                   profit\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 655: _Ibid._, ii., 2362.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 656: _L. and P._, ii., 3277, 3352.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 657: _Ibid._, ii., 3523.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 658: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 209, 210, 309;\r\n                   _cf._, _L. and P._, iv., 3051, 3352. Clement had\r\n                   given away Sicily and Naples to one of Charles's\r\n                   vassals \"which dealing may make me not take him as\r\n                   Pope, no, not for all the excommunications that he\r\n                   can make; for I stand under appellation to the next\r\n                   general council\". Every one--Charles V., Henry\r\n                   VIII., Cranmer--played an appeal to the next\r\n                   general council against the Pope's\r\n                   excommunication.]\r\n\r\nAnother result of the merging of the Pope in the Italian prince was\r\nthe practical exclusion of the English and other Northern nations from\r\nthe supreme council of Christendom. There was no apparent reason why\r\nan Englishman should not be the head of the Christian Church just as\r\nwell as an Italian; but there was some incongruity in the idea of an\r\nEnglishman ruling over Italian States, and no Englishman had attained\r\nthe Papacy for nearly four centuries. The double failure of Wolsey\r\nmade it clear that the door of the Papacy was sealed to Englishmen,\r\nwhatever their claims might be. The roll of cardinals tells a similar\r\ntale; the Roman curia graciously conceded that there should generally\r\nbe one English cardinal in the sacred college, but one in a body   (p. 231)\r\nof forty or fifty was thought as much as England could fairly demand.\r\nIt is not so very surprising that England repudiated the authority of\r\na tribunal in which its influence was measured on such a contemptible\r\nscale. The other nations of Europe thought much the same, and it is\r\nonly necessary to add up the number of cardinals belonging to each\r\nnationality to arrive at a fairly accurate indication of the peoples\r\nwho rejected papal pretensions. The nations most inadequately represented\r\nin the college of cardinals broke away from Rome; those which remained\r\nfaithful were the nations which controlled in the present, or might\r\nhope to control in the future, the supreme ecclesiastical power. Spain\r\nand France had little temptation to abolish an authority which they\r\nthemselves wielded in turn; for if the Pope was a Spaniard to-day, he\r\nmight well be a Frenchman to-morrow. There was no absurdity in\r\nFrenchmen or Spaniards ruling over the papal States; for France and\r\nSpain already held under their sway more Italian territory than\r\nItalian natives themselves. It was the subjection of the Pope to\r\nFrench and Spanish domination that prejudiced his claims in English\r\neyes. His authority was tolerable so long as the old ideal of the\r\nunity of Christendom under a single monarch retained its force, or\r\neven so long as the Pope was Italian pure and simple. But when Italy\r\nwas either Spanish or French, and the Pope the chaplain of one or the\r\nother monarch, the growing spirit of nationality could bear it no\r\nlonger; it responded at once to Henry's appeals against the claims of\r\na foreign jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt was a mere accident that the breach with Rome grew out of Spanish\r\ncontrol of the Pope. The separation was nearly effected more than  (p. 232)\r\na century earlier, as a result of the Pope's Babylonish captivity in\r\nFrance; and the wonder is, not that the breach took place when it did,\r\nbut that it was deferred for so long. At the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury all the elements were present but one for the ecclesiastical\r\nrevolution which was reserved for Henry VIII. to effect. The Papacy\r\nhad been discredited in English eyes by subservience to France, just\r\nas it had in 1529 by subservience to Charles. Lollardy was more\r\npowerful in England in the reign of Henry IV. than heresy was in the\r\nmiddle of that of Henry VIII. There was as strong a demand for the\r\nsecularisation of Church property on the part of the lay peers and\r\ngentry; and Wycliffe himself had anticipated the cardinal point of the\r\nlater movement by appealing to the State to reform the Church. But\r\ngreat revolutions depend on a number of causes working together, and\r\noften fail for the lack of one. The element lacking in the reign of\r\nHenry IV. was the King himself. The Lancastrians were orthodox from\r\nconviction and from the necessities of their position; they needed the\r\nsupport of the Church to bolster up a weak title to the crown. The\r\ncivil wars followed; and Henry VII. was too much absorbed in securing\r\nhis throne to pursue any quarrels with Rome. But when his son began to\r\nrule as well as to reign, it was inevitable that not merely questions\r\nof Church property and of the relations with the Papacy should come up\r\nfor revision, but also those issues between Church and State which had\r\nremained in abeyance during the fifteenth century. The divorce was the\r\nspark which ignited the flame, but the combustible materials had been\r\nlong existent. If the divorce had been all, there would have been no\r\nReformation in England. After the death of Anne Boleyn, Henry      (p. 233)\r\nmight have done some trifling penance at his subjects' expense, made\r\nthe Pope a present, or waged war on one of Clement's orthodox foes,\r\nand that would have been the end. Much had happened since the days of\r\nHildebrand, and Popes were no longer able to exact heroic repentance.\r\nThe divorce, in fact, was the occasion, and not the cause, of the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat movement, so far as Henry VIII. was concerned, was not in essence\r\ndoctrinal; neither was it primarily a schism between the English and\r\nRoman communions. It was rather an episode in the eternal dispute\r\nbetween Church and State. Throughout the quarrel, Henry and Elizabeth\r\nmaintained that they were merely reasserting their ancient royal\r\nprerogative over the Church, which the Pope of Rome had usurped.\r\nEnglish revolutions have always been based on specious conservative\r\npleas, and the only method of inducing Englishmen to change has been\r\nby persuasions that the change is not a change at all, or is a change\r\nto an older and better order. The Parliaments of the seventeenth\r\ncentury regarded the Stuart pretensions, as Henry and Elizabeth did\r\nthose of the Pope, in the light of usurpations upon their own\r\nimprescriptible rights; and more recently, movements to make the\r\nChurch Catholic have been based on the ground that it has never been\r\nanything else. The Tudor contention that the State was always supreme\r\nover the Church has been transformed into a theory that the Church was\r\nalways at least semi-independent of Rome. But it is not so clear that\r\nthe Church has always been anti-papal, as that the English laity have\r\nalways been anti-clerical.\r\n\r\nThe English people were certainly very anti-sacerdotal from the    (p. 234)\r\nthe very beginning of Henry VIII.'s reign. In 1512 James IV. complained\r\nto Henry that Englishmen seized Scots merchants, ill-treated them, and\r\nabused them as \"the Pope's men\".[659] At the end of the same year\r\nParliament deprived of their benefit of clergy all clerks under the\r\nrank of sub-deacon who committed murder or felony.[660] This measure\r\nat once provoked a cry of \"the Church in danger\". The Abbot of\r\nWinchcombe preached that the act was contrary to the law of God and to\r\nthe liberties of the Church, and that the lords, who consented\r\nthereto, had incurred a liability to spiritual censures. Standish,\r\nwarden of the Mendicant Friars of London, defended the action of\r\nParliament, while the temporal peers requested the bishops to make the\r\nAbbot of Winchcombe recant.[661] They refused, and, at the Convocation\r\nof 1515, Standish was summoned before it to explain his conduct. He\r\nappealed to the King; the judges pronounced that all who had taken\r\npart in the proceedings against Standish had incurred the penalties of\r\n_praemunire_. They also declared that the King could hold a Parliament\r\nwithout the spiritual lords, who only sat in virtue of their\r\ntemporalties. This opinion seems to have nothing to do with        (p. 235)\r\nthe dispute, but it is remarkable that, in one list of the peers\r\nattending the Parliament of 1515, there is not a single abbot.[662]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 659: _L. and P._, i., 3320. In 1516 one\r\n                   Humphrey Bonner preached a sermon ridiculing the\r\n                   Holy See (_ibid._, ii., 2692).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 660: In this, as in many other reforms,\r\n                   the English Parliament only anticipated the action\r\n                   of the Church; for on 12th February, 1516, Leo X.\r\n                   issued a bull prohibiting any one from being\r\n                   admitted, for the next five years, into minor\r\n                   orders unless he were simultaneously promoted to be\r\n                   sub-deacon; as many persons, to avoid appearing\r\n                   before the civil courts and to enjoy immunity,\r\n                   received the tonsure and minor orders without\r\n                   proceeding to the superior (_L. and P._, ii.,\r\n                   1532).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 661: _L. and P._, ii., 1313. Brewer\r\n                   impugns the authority of Keilway's report of this\r\n                   incident on the ground that he lived in Elizabeth's\r\n                   reign; that is true, but according to the _D.N.B._\r\n                   he was born in 1497, which makes him a strictly\r\n                   contemporary authority.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 662: _L. and P._, ii., 1131.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Abbot of Winchcombe and Friar Standish, the\r\nprelates claimed the same liberty of speech for Convocation as was\r\nenjoyed by Parliament; so that they could, without offence, have\r\nmaintained certain acts of Parliament to be against the laws of the\r\nChurch.[663] Wolsey interceded on their behalf, and begged that the\r\nmatter might be left to the Pope's decision, while Henry contented\r\nhimself with a declaration that he would maintain intact his royal\r\njurisdiction. This was not all that passed during that session of\r\nParliament and Convocation. At the end of his summary of the\r\nproceedings, Dr. John Taylor, who was both clerk of Parliament and\r\nprolocutor of Convocation, remarks: \"In this Parliament and\r\nConvocation the most dangerous quarrels broke out between the clergy\r\nand the secular power, respecting the Church's liberties\";[664] and\r\nthere exists a remarkable petition presented to this Parliament\r\nagainst clerical exactions; it complained that the clergy refused\r\nburial until after the gift of the deceased's best jewel, best garment\r\nor the like, and demanded that every curate should administer the\r\nsacrament when required to do so.[665] It was no wonder that Wolsey\r\nadvised \"the more speedy dissolution\" of this Parliament,[666] and\r\nthat, except in 1523, when financial straits compelled him, he did not\r\ncall another while he remained in power. His fall was the sign     (p. 236)\r\nfor the revival of Parliament, and it immediately took up the work\r\nwhere it was left in 1515.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 663: _Ibid._, ii., 1314.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 664: _Ibid._, ii., 1312.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 665: _Ibid._, ii., 1315; _cf._ another\r\n                   petition to the same effect from the inhabitants of\r\n                   London (_ibid._, i., 5725 (i.)).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 666: _Ibid._, ii., 1223.]\r\n\r\nThese significant proceedings did not stand alone. In 1515 the Bishop\r\nof London's chancellor was indicted for the murder of a citizen who\r\nhad been found dead in the Bishop's prison.[667] The Bishop interceded\r\nwith Wolsey to prevent the trial; any London jury would, he said,\r\nconvict any clerk, \"be he innocent as Abel; they be so maliciously set\r\n_in favorem haereticae pravitatis_\".[668] The heresy was no matter of\r\nbelief, but hatred of clerical immunities. The _Epistolae Obscurorum\r\nVirorum_, wrote More to Erasmus in 1516, was \"popular everywhere\";[669]\r\nand no more bitter a satire had yet been penned on the clergy. In this\r\nmatter Henry and his lay subjects were at one. Standish, whom Taylor\r\ndescribes as the promoter and instigator of all these evils, was a\r\nfavourite preacher at Henry's Court. The King, said Pace, had \"often\r\npraised his doctrine\".[670] But what was it? It was no advocacy of\r\nHenry's loved \"new learning,\" for Standish denounced the Greek\r\nTestament of Erasmus, and is held up to ridicule by the great Dutch\r\nhumanist;[671] Standish, too, was afterwards a stout defender of the\r\nPope's dispensing power, and followed Fisher in his protest against\r\nthe divorce before the legatine Court. The doctrine, which pleased the\r\nKing so much, was Standish's denial of clerical immunity from State\r\ncontrol, and his assertion of royal prerogatives over the Church.  (p. 237)\r\nIn 1518 the Bishopric of St. Asaph's fell vacant. Wolsey, who was then\r\nat the height of his power, recommended Bolton,[672] prior of St.\r\nBartholomew's, a learned man; but Henry was resolved to reward his\r\nfavourite divine, and Standish obtained the see. Pace, a good churchman,\r\nexpressed himself to Wolsey as \"mortified\" at the result, but said it\r\nwas inevitable, as besides the King's good graces, Standish enjoyed\r\n\"the favour of all the courtiers for the singular assistance he has\r\nrendered towards subverting the Church of England\".[673]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 667: See Dr. Gairdner, _History of\r\n                   English Church in Sixteenth Century_, ch. iii.,\r\n                   where the story of Richard Hunne is critically\r\n                   examined in detail. Its importance consists,\r\n                   however, not in the question whether Hunne was or\r\n                   was not murdered by the Bishop's chancellor Horsey,\r\n                   but in the popular hostility to the clergy revealed\r\n                   by the incident.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 668: _L. and P._, ii., 2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 669: _Ibid._, ii., 2492.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 670: _Ibid._, ii., 4074.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 671: _Ibid._, iii., 929.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 672: _L. and P._, ii., 4082.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 673: _Ibid._, ii., 4074.]\r\n\r\nEleven more years were to roll before the Church was subverted. They\r\nwere years of Wolsey's supremacy; he alone stood between the Church\r\nand its subjection. It was owing, wrote Campeggio, in 1528, to Wolsey's\r\nvigilance and solicitude that the Holy See retained its rank and\r\ndignity.[674] His ruin would drag down the Church, and the fact was\r\nknown to Anne Boleyn and her faction, to Campeggio and Clement VII.,\r\nas well as to Henry VIII.[675] \"These Lords intend,\" wrote Du Bellay,\r\non the eve of Wolsey's fall, \"after he is dead or ruined, to impeach\r\nthe State of the Church, and take all its goods; which it is hardly\r\nneedful for me to write in cipher, for they proclaim it openly. I\r\nexpect they will do fine miracles.\"[676] A few days later he says, \"I\r\nexpect the priests will never have the great seal again; and that in\r\nthis Parliament they will have terrible alarms. I think Dr. Stephen\r\n(Gardiner) will have a good deal to do with the management of affairs,\r\n_especially if he will abandon his order_.\"[677] At Easter, 1529,\r\nLutheran books were circulating in Henry's Court, advocating the   (p. 238)\r\nconfiscation of ecclesiastical property and the restoration of his\r\nChurch to its primitive simplicity. Campeggio warned the King against them\r\nand maintained that it had been determined by councils and theologians\r\nthat the Church justly held her temporalties. Henry retorted that\r\naccording to the Lutherans \"those decisions were arrived at by\r\necclesiastics and now it was necessary for the laity to interpose\".[678]\r\nIn his last interview with Henry, Campeggio \"alluded to this Parliament,\r\nwhich is about to be holden, and I earnestly pressed upon him the\r\nliberty of the Church. He certainly seemed to me very well disposed to\r\nexert his power to the utmost.\"[679] \"Down with the Church\" was going\r\nto be the Parliament cry. Whether Henry would really \"exert his power\"\r\nto maintain her liberties remained to be seen, but there never was a\r\nflimsier theory than that the divorce of Catherine was the sole cause\r\nof the break with Rome. The centrifugal forces were quite independent\r\nof the divorce; its historical importance lies in the fact that it\r\nalienated from Rome the only power in England which might have kept\r\nthem in check. So long as Wolsey and the clerical statesmen, with whom\r\nhe surrounded the King, remained supreme, the Church was comparatively\r\nsafe. But Wolsey depended entirely on Henry's support; when that was\r\nwithdrawn, Church and Cardinal fell together.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 674: _Ibid._, iv., 4898.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 675: _Ibid._, iv., 5210, 5255, 5581,\r\n                   5582.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 676: _Ibid._, iv., 6011.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 677: _Ibid._, 6019.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 678: _L. and P._, iv., 5416.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 679: _Ibid._, iv., 5995. Henry VIII. no\r\n                   doubt also had his eye on Gustavus in Sweden where\r\n                   the Vesteraes Recess of 1527 had provided that all\r\n                   episcopal, capitular and monastic property which\r\n                   was not absolutely required should be handed over\r\n                   to the King, and conferred upon him an\r\n                   ecclesiastical jurisdiction as extensive as that\r\n                   afterwards conferred upon Henry VIII. (_Cambridge\r\n                   Modern Hist._, ii., 626).]\r\n\r\nWolsey's ruin was, however, due to more causes than his failure    (p. 239)\r\nto get a divorce for the King. It was at bottom the result of the\r\nnatural development of Henry's character. Egotism was from the first\r\nhis most prominent trait; it was inevitably fostered by the\r\nextravagant adulation paid to Tudor sovereigns, and was further\r\nencouraged by his realisation, first of his own mental powers, and\r\nthen of the extent to which he could force his will upon others. He\r\ncould never brook a rival in whatever sphere he wished to excel. In\r\nthe days of his youth he was absorbed in physical sports, in gorgeous\r\npageantry and ceremonial; he was content with such exhibitions as\r\nprancing before the ladies between every course in a tourney, or\r\nacting as pilot on board ship, blowing a whistle as loud as a trumpet,\r\nand arrayed in trousers of cloth of gold. Gradually, as time wore on,\r\nthe athletic mania wore off, and pursuits, such as architecture, took\r\nthe place of physical sports. A generation later, a writer describes\r\nHenry as \"the only Phoenix of his time for fine and curious masonry\".[680]\r\nFrom his own original designs York House was transformed into\r\nWhitehall Palace, Nonsuch Palace was built, and extensive alterations\r\nwere made at Greenwich and Hampton Court.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 680: Harrison, _Description of England_,\r\n                   in Holinshed, ed. 1577, bk. ii., chap. ix.]\r\n\r\nBut architecture was only a trifle; Henry's uncontrollable activity\r\nalso broke out in political spheres, and the eruption was fatal to\r\nWolsey's predominance. The King was still in the full vigour of\r\nmanhood; he had not reached his fortieth year, and his physical graces\r\nwere the marvel of those who saw him for the first time. Falier, the\r\nnew Venetian ambassador, who arrived in England in 1529, is as     (p. 240)\r\nrapturous over the King's personal attractions as Giustinian or\r\nPasqualigo had been. \"In this Eighth Henry,\" he writes, \"God has\r\ncombined such corporeal and intellectual beauty as not merely to\r\nsurprise but astound all men.... His face is angelic (nine years\r\nbefore a Frenchman had called it \"feminine\"), rather than handsome;\r\nhis head imperial and bold; and he wears a beard, contrary to the\r\nEnglish custom. Who would not be amazed, when contemplating such\r\nsingular beauty of person, coupled with such bold address, adapting\r\nitself with the greatest ease to every manly exercise?\"[681] But\r\nHenry's physique was no longer proof against every ailment; frequent\r\nmention is made about this time of headaches[682] which incapacitated\r\nhim from business, and it was not long before there appeared on his\r\nleg the fistula which racked him with pain till the end of his life,\r\nand eventually caused his death.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 681: _Ven. Cal._, iv., 184, 185, 293.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 682: _L. and P._, iv., 4546. Henry had\r\n                   had small-pox in February, 1514 (_ibid._, i.,\r\n                   4831), without any serious consequences, but apart\r\n                   from that he had had no great illness.]\r\n\r\nThe divorce and the insuperable obstacles, which he discovered in\r\nattaining the end he thought easy at first, did more to harden Henry's\r\ntemper than any bodily ills. He became a really serious man, and\r\ndeveloped that extraordinary power of self-control which stood him in\r\ngood stead in his later years. Naturally a man of violent passions, he\r\ncould never have steered clear of the dangers that beset him without\r\nunusual capacity for curbing his temper, concealing his intentions,\r\nand keeping his own counsel. Ministers might flatter themselves that\r\nthey could read his mind and calculate his actions, but it is quite\r\ncertain that henceforth no minister read so clearly his master's   (p. 241)\r\nmind as the master did his minister's. \"Three may keep counsel,\" said\r\nthe King in 1530,[683] \"if two be away; and if I thought that my cap\r\nknew my counsel, I would cast it into the fire and burn it.\" \"Never,\"\r\ncomments a modern writer,[684] \"had the King spoken a truer word, or\r\ndescribed himself more accurately. Few would have thought that, under\r\nso careless and splendid an exterior--the very ideal of bluff,\r\nopen-hearted good-humour and frankness--there lay a watchful and\r\nsecret eye, that marked what was going on, without appearing to mark\r\nit; kept its own counsel until it was time to strike, and then struck,\r\nas suddenly and remorselessly as a beast of prey. It was strange to\r\nwitness so much subtlety, combined with so much strength.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 683: Cavendish, _Life of Wolsey_, p.\r\n                   397.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 684: Brewer, Introd. to _L. and P._, iv.,\r\n                   p. dcxxi.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of his remorseless blows and arbitrary temper, Henry was too\r\nshrewd and too great a man to despise the counsel of others, or think\r\nany worse of an adviser because his advice differed from his own. He\r\nloved to meet argument with argument, even when he might command. To\r\nthe end of his days he valued a councillor who would honestly maintain\r\nthe opposite of what the King desired. These councillors to whom he\r\ngave his confidence were never minions or servile flatterers. Henry\r\nhad his Court favourites with whom he hunted and shot and diced; with\r\nwhom he played--always for money--tennis, primero and bowls, and the\r\nmore mysterious games of Pope July, Imperial and Shovelboard;[685] and\r\nto whom he threw many an acre of choice monastic land. But they never\r\ninfluenced his policy. No man was ever advanced to political       (p. 242)\r\npower in Henry's reign, merely because he pandered to the King's\r\nvanity or to his vices. No one was a better judge of conduct in the\r\ncase of others, or a sterner champion of moral probity, when it did\r\nnot conflict with his own desires or conscience. In 1528 Anne Boleyn\r\nand her friends were anxious to make a relative abbess of Wilton.[686]\r\nBut she had been notoriously unchaste. \"Wherefore,\" wrote Henry to\r\nAnne herself, \"I would not, for all the gold in the world, cloak your\r\nconscience nor mine to make her ruler of a house which is of so\r\nungodly demeanour; nor I trust you would not that neither for brother\r\nnor sister I should so distain mine honour or conscience.\" He\r\nobjected, on similar grounds, to the prioress whom Wolsey wished to\r\nnominate; the Cardinal neglected Henry's wishes, and thereby called\r\ndown upon himself a rebuke remarkable for dignity and delicacy. \"The\r\ngreat affection and love I bear you,\" wrote the King, \"causeth me,\r\nusing the doctrine of my Master, saying _Quem diligo, castigo_, thus\r\nplainly, as ensueth, to break to you my mind.... Methink it is not the\r\nright train of a trusty loving friend and servant, when the matter is\r\nput by the master's consent into his arbitre and judgment (specially\r\nin a matter wherein his master hath both royalty and interest), to\r\nelect and choose a person which was by him defended (forbidden). And\r\nyet another thing, which much displeaseth me more,--that is, to cloak\r\nyour offence made by ignorance of my pleasure, saying that you\r\nexpressly knew not my determinate mind in that behalf.\" Then, after\r\nshowing how empty were Wolsey's excuses, he continues: \"Ah! my Lord,\r\nit is a double offence, both to do ill and colour it too; but with (p. 243)\r\nmen that have wit it cannot be accepted so. Wherefore, good my Lord,\r\nuse no more that way with me, for there is no man living that more\r\nhateth it.\" He then proceeds to warn the Cardinal against sinister\r\nreports with regard to his methods of raising money for his college at\r\nOxford. \"They say the college is a cloak for all mischief. I perceive\r\nby your letter that you have received money of the exempts for having\r\ntheir old visitors. If your legacy (legatine authority) is a cloak\r\n_apud homines_, it is not _apud Deum_. I doubt not, therefore, you\r\nwill desist.\" Wolsey had used his legatine authority to extort money\r\nfrom monasteries as the price of their immunity from his visitatorial\r\npowers. The monasteries, too, had strenuously opposed the late\r\nAmicable Loan to the King; by Wolsey's means they had been released\r\nfrom that obligation; and Henry strongly suspected that they had\r\npurchased their exemption from relieving his necessities by lavish\r\ncontributions to the Cardinal's colleges. \"I pray you, my Lord,\" he\r\nconcludes, \"think not that it is upon any displeasure that I write\r\nthis unto you. For surely it is for my discharge afore God, being in\r\nthe room that I am in; and secondly for the great zeal I bear unto\r\nyou.\" Henry possessed in the highest degree not a few of the best of\r\nkingly attributes. His words are not the words of a hypocrite without\r\nconscience, devoid of the fear of God and man. For all the strange and\r\nviolent things that he did, he obtained the sanction of his\r\nconscience, but his imperious egotism made conscience his humble\r\nslave, and blinded to his own sins a judgment so keen to detect and\r\nchastise the failings of others.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 685: See various entries in Privy Purse\r\n                   Expenses, _L. and P._, v., 747-62.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 686: _L. and P._, iv., 4477, 4488, 4507,\r\n                   4509.]\r\n\r\nThese incidents, of more than a year before the Cardinal's fall,   (p. 244)\r\nillustrate the change in the respective positions of monarch and\r\nminister. There was no doubt now which was the master; there was no\r\nking but one. Henry was already taking, as Du Bellay said, \"the\r\nmanagement of everything\".[687] Wolsey himself knew that he had lost\r\nthe King's confidence. He began to talk of retirement. He told Du\r\nBellay, in or before August, 1528, that when he had established a firm\r\namity between France and England, extinguished the hatred between the\r\ntwo nations, reformed the laws and customs of England, and settled the\r\nsuccession, he would retire and serve God to the end of his days.[688]\r\nThe Frenchman thought this was merely to represent as voluntary a loss\r\nof power which he saw would soon be inevitable; but the conversation\r\nis a striking illustration of the difference between Henry and Wolsey,\r\nand helps to explain why Wolsey accomplished so little that lasted,\r\nwhile Henry accomplished so much. The Cardinal seems to have been\r\nentirely devoid of that keen perception of the distinction between\r\nwhat was, and what was not, practicable, which was Henry's saving\r\ncharacteristic. In the evening of his days, after sixteen years of\r\nalmost unlimited power, he was speaking of plans, which might have\r\ntaxed the energies of a life-time, as preliminaries to a speedy\r\nwithdrawal from the cares of State. He had enjoyed an unequalled\r\nopportunity of effecting these reforms, but what were the results of\r\nhis administration? The real greatness and splendour of Henry's reign\r\nare said to have departed with Wolsey's fall.[689] The gilt and the\r\ntinsel were indeed stripped off, but the permanent results of      (p. 245)\r\nHenry's reign were due to its later course. Had he died when Wolsey\r\nfell, what would have been his place in history? A brilliant figure,\r\nno doubt, who might have been thought capable of much, had he not\r\nfailed to achieve anything. He had made wars from which England\r\nderived no visible profit; not an acre of territory had been acquired;\r\nthe wealth, amassed by Henry VII., had been squandered, and Henry\r\nVIII., in 1529, was reduced to searching for gold mines in\r\nEngland.[690] The loss of his subjects' blood and treasure had been\r\nfollowed by the loss of their affections. The exuberant loyalty of\r\n1509 had been turned into the wintry discontent of 1527. England had\r\nbeen raised to a high place in the councils of Europe by 1521, but her\r\nfall was quite as rapid, and in 1525 she counted for less than she had\r\ndone in 1513. At home the results were equally barren; the English\r\nhold on Ireland was said, in 1528, to be weaker than it had been since\r\nthe conquest;[691] and the English statute-book between 1509 and 1529\r\nmay be searched in vain for an act of importance, while the\r\nstatute-book between 1529 and 1547 contains a list of acts which have\r\nnever been equalled for their supreme importance in the subsequent\r\nhistory of England.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 687: _L. and P._, iv., 5983; _cf._ iv.,\r\n                   3992, where Henry has an interview (March, 1528)\r\n                   with a Scots ambassador and tells no one about it.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 688: _Ibid._, iv., 4649.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 689: Brewer, _Ibid._, iv., Introd., p.\r\n                   dcxxii.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 690: _L. and P._, iv., 5209.

Its position in 1521 was artificial; it had\r\nnot the means to support a grandeur which was only built on the wealth\r\nleft by Henry VII. and on Wolsey's skill. England owed her advance (p. 246)\r\nin repute to the fact that Wolsey made her the paymaster of Europe.\r\n\"The reputation of England for wealth,\" said an English diplomatist in\r\n1522, \"is a great cause of the esteem in which it is held.\"[692] But,\r\nby 1523, that wealth had failed; Parliament refused to levy more\r\ntaxes, and Wolsey's pretensions collapsed like a pack of cards. He\r\nplayed no part in the peace of Cambrai, which settled for the time the\r\nconditions of Europe. When rumours of the clandestine negotiations\r\nbetween France and Spain reached England, Wolsey staked his head to\r\nthe King that they were pure invention.[693] He could not believe that\r\npeace was possible, unless it were made by him. But the rumours were\r\ntrue, and Henry exacted the penalty. The positive results of the\r\nCardinal's policy were nil; the chief negative result was that he had\r\nstaved off for many years the ruin of the Church, but he only did it\r\nby plunging England in the maelstrom of foreign intrigue and of futile\r\nwars.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 692: _L. and P._, iii., 1978.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 693: _Ibid._, iv., 5231.]\r\n\r\nThe end was not long delayed. \"I see clearly,\" writes Du Bellay on 4th\r\nOctober, 1529, \"that by this Parliament Wolsey will completely lose\r\nhis influence; I see no chance to the contrary.\"[694] Henry anticipated\r\nthe temper of Parliament. A bill of indictment was preferred against\r\nhim in the Court of King's Bench, and on the 22nd of October he\r\nacknowledged his liability to the penalties of _praemunire_.[695] The\r\nGreat Seal was taken from him by the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk. In\r\nNovember the House of Lords passed a bill of attainder against him,\r\nbut the Commons were persuaded by Cromwell, acting with Henry's    (p. 247)\r\nconnivance, to throw it out. \"The King,\" wrote Chapuys, \"is thought to\r\nbear the Cardinal no ill-will;\" and Campeggio thought that he would\r\n\"not go to extremes, but act considerately in this matter, as he is\r\naccustomed to do in all his actions.\"[696] Wolsey was allowed to\r\nretain the Archbishopric of York, a sum in money and goods equivalent\r\nto at least L70,000, and a pension of 1,000 marks from the See of\r\nWinchester.[697] In the following spring he set out to spend his last\r\ndays in his northern see; six months he devoted to his archiepiscopal\r\nduties, confirming thousands of children, arranging disputes among\r\nneighbours, and winning such hold on the hearts of the people as he\r\nhad never known in the days of his pride. Crowds in London had flocked\r\nto gloat over the sight of the broken man; now crowds in Yorkshire\r\ncame to implore his blessing.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 694: _Ibid._, iv., 5983.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 695: _Ibid._, iv., 6017.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 696: _L. and P._, iv., 6199, 6050; _cf._\r\n                   iv., 6295, where Henry orders Dacre to treat Wolsey\r\n                   as became his rank; _Ven. Cal._, 1529, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 697: _Ibid._, iv., 6220.]\r\n\r\nHe prepared for his installation at York on 7th November, 1530; on the\r\n4th he was arrested for treason. His Italian physician, Agostini, had\r\nbetrayed him; he was accused of having asked Francis I. to intercede\r\nwith Henry on his behalf, which was true;[698] and he seems also to\r\nhave sought the mediation of Charles V. But Agostini further declared\r\nthat Wolsey had written to Clement, urging him to excommunicate Henry\r\nand raise an insurrection, by which the Cardinal might recover his\r\npower.[699] By Pontefract, Doncaster, Nottingham, with feeble      (p. 248)\r\nsteps and slow, the once-proud prelate, broken in spirit and shattered\r\nin health, returned to meet his doom. His gaol was to be the cell in\r\nthe Tower, which had served for the Duke of Buckingham.[700] But a\r\nkindlier fate than a traitor's death was in store. \"I am come,\" he\r\nsaid to the monks of Leicester Abbey, \"I am come to leave my bones\r\namong you.\" He died there at eight o'clock on St. Andrew's morning,\r\nand there, on the following day, he was simply and quietly buried.\r\n\"If,\" he exclaimed in his last hour, \"I had served God as diligently\r\nas I have done the King, He would not have given me over in my grey\r\nhairs.\" That cry, wrung from Wolsey, echoed throughout the Tudor\r\ntimes.[701] Men paid _le nouveau Messie_ a devotion they owed to the\r\nold; they rendered unto Caesar the things that were God's. They reaped\r\ntheir reward in riches and pomp and power, but they won no peace of\r\nmind. The favour of princes is fickle, and \"the wrath of the King is\r\ndeath\". So thought Wolsey and Warham and Norfolk. \"Is that all?\" said\r\nMore, with prophetic soul, to Norfolk; \"then in good faith between\r\nyour grace and me is but this, that I shall die to-day and you shall\r\ndie to-morrow.\"[702]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 698: _Ibid._, iv., 6018, 6199, 6273,\r\n                   6738.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 699: De Vaux writes on 8th November,\r\n                   1530, to Montmorenci, that the King had told him\r\n                   \"where and how\" Wolsey had intrigued against him,\r\n                   but he does not repeat the information (_ibid._,\r\n                   iv., 6720), though Bryan's remark (_ibid._, iv.,\r\n                   6733) that \"De Vaux has done well in disclosing the\r\n                   misdemeanour of the Cardinal\" suggests that De Vaux\r\n                   knew more than he says.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 700: So Chapuys reports (iv., 6738); that\r\n                   Wolsey had used Agostini to sound Chapuys is\r\n                   obvious from the latter's remark, \"were the\r\n                   physician to say all that passed between us, he\r\n                   could not do anything to impugn me\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 701: _Cf._ Buckingham's remark in _L. and\r\n                   P._, iii., 1356: \"An he had not offended no more\r\n                   unto God than he had done to the Crown, he should\r\n                   die as true a man as ever was in the world\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 702: _D.N.B._, xxxviii., 437.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.                                                         (p. 249)\r\n\r\nTHE KING AND HIS PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of July, 1529, a courier came posting from Rome\r\nwith despatches announcing the alliance of Clement and Charles, and\r\nthe revocation to the Papal Court of the suit between Henry VIII. and\r\nthe Emperor's aunt. Henry replied with no idle threats or empty\r\nreproaches, but his retort was none the less effective. On the 9th of\r\nAugust[703] writs were issued from Chancery summoning that Parliament\r\nwhich met on the 3rd of November and did not separate till the last\r\nlink in the chain which bound England to Rome was sundered, and the\r\ncountry was fairly launched on that sixty years' struggle which the\r\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada concluded.[704] The step might well seem\r\na desperate hazard. The last Parliament had broken up in           (p. 250)\r\ndiscontent; it had been followed by open revolt in various shires;\r\nwhile from others there had since then come demands for the repayment\r\nof the loan, which Henry was in no position to grant. Francis and\r\nCharles, on whose mutual enmity England's safety largely depended, had\r\nmade their peace at Cambrai; and the Emperor was free to foment\r\ndisaffection in Ireland and to instigate Scotland to war. His chancellor\r\nwas boasting that the imperialists could, if they would, drive Henry\r\nfrom his kingdom within three months,[705] and he based his hopes on\r\nrevolt among Henry's own subjects. The divorce had been from the\r\nbeginning, and remained to the end, a stumbling-block to the people.\r\nCatherine received ovations wherever she went, while the utmost\r\nefforts of the King could scarcely protect Anne Boleyn from popular\r\ninsult. The people were moved, not only by a creditable feeling that\r\nHenry's first wife was an injured woman, but by the fear lest a breach\r\nwith Charles should destroy their trade in wool, on which, said the\r\nimperial ambassador, half the realm depended for sustenance.[706]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 703: Rymer, _Foedera_, xiv., 302.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 704: It has been alleged that the\r\n                   immediate object of this Parliament was to relieve\r\n                   the King from the necessity of repaying the loan\r\n                   (_D.N.B._, xxvi., 83); and much scorn has been\r\n                   poured on the notion that it had any important\r\n                   purpose (_L. and P._, iv., Introd., p. dcxlvii.).\r\n                   Brewer even denies its hostility to the Church on\r\n                   the ground that it was composed largely of lawyers,\r\n                   and \"lawyers are not in general enemies to things\r\n                   established; they are not inimical to the clergy\".\r\n                   Yet the law element was certainly stronger in the\r\n                   Parliaments of Charles I. than in that of 1529;\r\n                   were they not hostile to \"things established\" and\r\n                   \"inimical to the clergy\"? Contemporaries had a\r\n                   different opinion of the purpose of the Parliament\r\n                   of 1529. \"It is intended,\" wrote Du Bellay on the\r\n                   23rd of August, three months before Parliament met,\r\n                   \"to hold a Parliament here this winter and act by\r\n                   their own absolute power, in default of justice\r\n                   being administered by the Pope in this divorce\"\r\n                   (_ibid._, iv., 5862; _cf._ iv., 6011, 6019, 6307);\r\n                   \"nothing else,\" wrote a Florentine in December,\r\n                   1530, \"is thought of in that island every day\r\n                   except of arranging affairs in such a way that they\r\n                   do no longer be in want of the Pope, neither for\r\n                   filling vacancies in the Church, nor for any other\r\n                   purpose\" (_ibid._, iv., 6774).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 705: _L. and P._, iv., 4909, 4911; _cf._\r\n                   5177, 5501.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 706: _Ibid._, vi., 1528.]\r\n\r\nTo summon a Parliament at such a conjuncture seemed to be courting\r\ncertain ruin. In reality, it was the first and most striking instance\r\nof the audacity and insight which were to enable Henry to guide the\r\nwhirlwind and direct the storm of the last eighteen years of his   (p. 251)\r\nreign. Clement had put in his hands the weapon with which he secured\r\nhis divorce and broke the bonds of Rome. \"If,\" wrote Wolsey a day or\r\ntwo before the news of the revocation arrived, \"the King be cited to\r\nappear at Rome in person or by proxy, and his prerogative be interfered\r\nwith, none of his subjects will tolerate it. If he appears in Italy,\r\nit will be at the head of a formidable army.\"[707] A sympathiser with\r\nCatherine expressed his resentment at his King being summoned to plead\r\nas a party in his own realm before the legatine Court;[708] and it has\r\neven been suggested that those proceedings were designed to irritate\r\npopular feeling against the Roman jurisdiction. Far more offensive was\r\nit to national prejudice, that England's king should be cited to\r\nappear before a court in a distant land, dominated by the arms of a\r\nforeign prince. Nothing did more to alienate men's minds from the\r\nPapacy. Henry would never have been able to obtain his divorce on its\r\nmerits as they appeared to his people. But now the divorce became\r\nclosely interwoven with another and a wider question, the papal\r\njurisdiction in England; and on that question Henry carried with him\r\nthe good wishes of the vast bulk of the laity. There were few Englishmen\r\nwho would not resent the petition presented to the Pope in 1529 by\r\nCharles V. and Ferdinand that the English Parliament should be forbidden\r\nto discuss the question of divorce.[709] By summoning Parliament,\r\nHenry opened the floodgates of anti-papal and anti-sacerdotal feelings\r\nwhich Wolsey had long kept shut; and the unpopular divorce became  (p. 252)\r\nmerely a cross-current in the main stream which flowed in Henry's favour.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 707: _L. and P._, iv., 5797.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 708: Cavendish, p. 210; _L. and P._, iv.,\r\n                   Introd., p. dv.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 709: _Sp. Cal._, iii., 979.]\r\n\r\nIt was thus with some confidence that Henry appealed from the Pope to\r\nhis people. He could do so all the more surely, if, as is alleged,\r\nthere was no freedom of election, and if the House of Commons was\r\npacked with royal nominees.[710] But these assertions may be dismissed\r\nas gross exaggerations. The election of county members was marked by\r\nunmistakable signs of genuine popular liberty. There was often a riot,\r\nand sometimes a secret canvass among freeholders to promote or defeat\r\na particular candidate.[711] In 1547 the council ventured to recommend\r\na minister to the freeholders of Kent. The electors objected; the\r\ncouncil reprimanded the sheriff for representing its recommendation as\r\na command; it protested that it never dreamt of depriving the shire of\r\nits \"liberty of election,\" but \"would take it thankfully\" if the\r\nelectors would give their voices to the ministerial candidate. The\r\nelectors were not to be soothed by soft words, and that Government\r\ncandidate had to find another seat.[712] In the boroughs there was\r\nevery variety of franchise. In some it was almost democratic; in\r\nothers elections were in the hands of one or two voters. In the city\r\nof London the election for the Parliament of 1529 was held on      (p. 253)\r\n5th October, _immensa communitate tunc presente_, in the Guildhall;\r\nthere is no hint of royal interference, the election being conducted\r\nin the customary way, namely, two candidates were nominated by the\r\nmayor and aldermen, and two by the citizens.[713] The general tendency\r\nhad for more than a century, however, been towards close corporations\r\nin whose hands the parliamentary franchise was generally vested, and\r\nconsequently towards restricting the basis of popular representation.\r\nThe narrower that basis became, the greater the facilities it afforded\r\nfor external influence. In many boroughs elections were largely\r\ndetermined by recommendations from neighbouring magnates, territorial\r\nor official.[714] At Gatton the lords of the manor nominated the\r\nmembers for Parliament, and the formal election was merely a matter of\r\ndrawing up an indenture between Sir Roger Copley and the sheriff,[715]\r\nand the Bishop of Winchester was wont to select representatives for\r\nmore than one borough within the bounds of his diocese.[716] The Duke\r\nof Norfolk claimed to be able to return ten members in Sussex and\r\nSurrey alone.[717]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 710: \"The choice of the electors,\" says\r\n                   Brewer (_L. and P._, iv., Introd., p. dcxlv.), \"was\r\n                   still determined by the King or his powerful\r\n                   ministers with as much certainty and assurance as\r\n                   that of the sheriffs.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 711: _L. and P._, i., 792, vii., 1178,\r\n                   where mention is made of \"secret labour\" among the\r\n                   freeholders of Warwickshire for the bye-election on\r\n                   Sir E.

Their views depended on those of their patrons,\r\nwho might be opposed to the Court; and, in 1539, Cromwell's agents\r\nwere considering the advisability of setting up Crown candidates\r\nagainst those of Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester.[718] The curious\r\nletter to Cromwell in 1529,[719] upon which is based the theory that\r\nthe House of Commons consisted of royal nominees, is singularly\r\ninconclusive. Cromwell sought Henry's permission to serve in\r\nParliament for two reasons; firstly, he was still a servant of the\r\nobnoxious and fallen Cardinal; secondly, he was seeking to transfer\r\nhimself to Henry's service, and thought he might be useful to the King\r\nin the House of Commons. If Henry accepted his offer, Cromwell was to\r\nbe nominated for Oxford; if he were not elected there, he was to be\r\nput up for one of the boroughs in the diocese of Winchester, then\r\nvacant through Wolsey's resignation. Even with the King's assent, his\r\nelection at Oxford was not regarded as certain; and, as a matter of\r\nfact, Cromwell sat neither for Oxford, nor for any constituency    (p. 255)\r\nin the diocese of Winchester, but for the borough of Taunton.[720]\r\nCrown influence could only make itself effectively felt in the limited\r\nnumber of royal boroughs; and the attempts to increase that influence\r\nby the creation of constituencies susceptible to royal influence were\r\nall subsequent in date to 1529. The returns of members of Parliament\r\nare not extant from 1477 to 1529, but a comparison of the respective\r\nnumber of constituencies in those two years reveals only six in 1529\r\nwhich had not sent members to a previous Parliament; and almost if not\r\nall of these six owed their representation to their increasing\r\npopulation and importance, and not to any desire to pack the House of\r\nCommons. Indeed, as a method of enforcing the royal will upon\r\nParliament, the creation of half a dozen boroughs was both futile and\r\nunnecessary. So small a number of votes was useless, except in the\r\ncase of a close division of well-drilled parties, of which there is no\r\ntrace in the Parliaments of Henry VIII.[721] The House of Commons\r\nacted as a whole, and not in two sections. \"The sense of the House\"\r\nwas more apparent in its decisions then than it is to-day. Actual\r\ndivisions were rare; either a proposal commended itself to the House,\r\nor it did not; and in both cases the question was usually determined\r\nwithout a vote.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 718: This seems to have been the object\r\n                   of Southampton's tour through the constituencies of\r\n                   Surrey and Hampshire in March, 1539; with one of\r\n                   Gardiner's pocket-boroughs he did not meddle,\r\n                   because the lord chamberlain was the Bishop's\r\n                   steward there (_L. and P._, xiv., i., 520). There\r\n                   were some royal nominees in the House of Commons.\r\n                   In 1523 the members for Cumberland were nominated\r\n                   by the Crown (_ibid._, iii., 2931); at Calais the\r\n                   lord-deputy and council elected one of the two\r\n                   burgesses and the mayor and burgesses the other\r\n                   (_ibid._, x., 736). Calais and the Scottish Borders\r\n                   were of course exceptionally under Crown influence,\r\n                   but this curious practice may have been observed in\r\n                   some other cities and boroughs; in 1534, for\r\n                   instance, the King was to nominate to one of the\r\n                   two vacancies at Worcester (_ibid._, vii., 56).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 719: _Ibid._, iv., App. 238.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 720: _Official Return of Members of\r\n                   Parliament_, i., 370.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 721: Occasionally there were divisions,\r\n                   _e.g._, in 1523 when the court party voted a\r\n                   subsidy of 2_s._ in the pound; but this was only\r\n                   half the sum demanded by Wolsey (Hall, pp. 656,\r\n                   657, Ellis, _Orig. Letters_, I., i., 220, 221).]\r\n\r\nThe creation of boroughs was also unnecessary. Parliaments packed\r\nthemselves quite well enough to suit Henry's purpose, without      (p. 256)\r\nany interference on his part. The limiting of the county franchise to\r\nforty-shilling (_i.e._, thirty pounds in modern currency) freeholders,\r\nand the dying away of democratic feeling in the towns, left\r\nparliamentary representation mainly in the hands of the landed gentry\r\nand of the prosperous commercial classes; and from them the Tudors\r\nderived their most effective support. There was discontent in\r\nabundance during Tudor times, but it was social and economic, and not\r\nas a rule political. It was directed against the enclosers of common\r\nlands; against the agricultural capitalists, who bought up farms,\r\nevicted the tenants, and converted their holdings to pasture; against\r\nthe large traders in towns who monopolised commerce at the expense of\r\ntheir poorer competitors. It was concerned, not with the one tyrant on\r\nthe throne, but with the thousand petty tyrants of the villages and\r\ntowns, against whom the poorer commons looked to their King for\r\nprotection. Of this discontent Parliament could not be the focus, for\r\nmembers of Parliament were themselves the offenders. \"It is hard,\"\r\nwrote a contemporary radical, \"to have these ills redressed by\r\nParliament, because it pricketh them chiefly which be chosen to be\r\nburgesses.... Would to God they would leave their old accustomed\r\nchoosing of burgesses! For whom do they choose but such as be rich or\r\nbear some office in the country, many times such as be boasters and\r\nbraggers? Such have they ever hitherto chosen; be he never so very a\r\nfool, drunkard, extortioner, adulterer, never so covetous and crafty a\r\nperson, yet, if he be rich, bear any office, if he be a jolly cracker\r\nand bragger in the country, he must be a burgess of Parliament. Alas,\r\nhow can any such study, or give any godly counsel for the          (p. 257)\r\ncommonwealth?\"[722] This passage gives no support to the theory that\r\nmembers of Parliament were nothing but royal nominees. If the\r\nconstituencies themselves were bent on electing \"such as bare office\r\nin the country,\" there was no call for the King's intervention; and\r\nthe rich merchants and others, of whom complaint is made, were almost\r\nas much to the royal taste as were the officials themselves.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 722: Brinkelow, _Complaynt of Roderik\r\n                   Mors_ (Early English Text Society), pp. 12, 13; for\r\n                   other evidence of the attitude of Parliament\r\n                   towards social grievances, see John Hales's letter\r\n                   to Somerset in _Lansdowne MS._, 238; Crowley's\r\n                   _Works_ (Early English Text Society), _passim_;\r\n                   Latimer, _Sermons_, p. 247.]\r\n\r\nFor the time being, in fact, the interests of the King and of the lay\r\nmiddle classes coincided, both in secular and ecclesiastical affairs.\r\nCommercial classes are generally averse from war, at least from war\r\nwaged within their own borders, from which they can extract no profit.\r\nThey had every inducement to support Henry's Government against the\r\nonly alternative, anarchy. In ecclesiastical politics they, as well as\r\nthe King, had their grievances against the Church. Both thought the\r\nclergy too rich, and that ecclesiastical revenues could be put to\r\nbetter uses in secular hands. Community of interests produced harmony\r\nof action; and a century and a half was to pass before Parliament\r\nagain met so often, or sat so long, as it did during the latter half\r\nof Henry's reign. From 1509 to 1515 there had been on an average a\r\nparliamentary session once a year,[723] and in February, 1512, Warham,\r\nas Lord Chancellor, had in opening the session discoursed on the   (p. 258)\r\nnecessity of frequent Parliaments.[724] Then there supervened the\r\necclesiastical despotism of Wolsey, who tried, like Charles I., to\r\nrule without Parliament, and with the same fatal result to himself;\r\nbut, from Wolsey's fall till Henry's death, there was seldom a year\r\nwithout a parliamentary session. Tyrants have often gone about to\r\nbreak Parliaments, and in the end Parliaments have generally broken\r\nthem. Henry was not of the number; he never went about to break\r\nParliament. He found it far too useful, and he used it. He would have\r\nbeen as reluctant to break Parliament as Ulysses the bow which he\r\nalone could bend.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 723: The first Parliament of the reign\r\n                   met in January, 1510, the second in February, 1512.\r\n                   It had a second session, November-December of the\r\n                   same year (_L. and P._, i., 3502). A third\r\n                   Parliament met for its first session on 23rd\r\n                   January, 1514, for its second on 5th February,\r\n                   1515, and for its third on 12th November, 1515\r\n                   (_ibid._, i., 5616, 5725, ii., 1130). It was this\r\n                   last of which Wolsey urged \"the more speedy\r\n                   dissolution\"; then for fourteen years there was\r\n                   only one Parliament, that of 1523. These dates\r\n                   illustrate the antagonism between Wolsey and\r\n                   Parliament and show how natural it was that Wolsey\r\n                   should fall in 1529, and that his fall should\r\n                   coincide with the revival of Parliament.]\r\n\r\nNo monarch, in fact, was ever a more zealous champion of parliamentary\r\nprivileges, a more scrupulous observer of parliamentary forms, or a\r\nmore original pioneer of sound constitutional doctrine. In 1543 he\r\nfirst enunciated the constitutional principle that sovereignty is\r\nvested in the \"King in Parliament\". \"We,\" he declared to the Commons,\r\n\"at no time stand so highly in our estate royal as in the time of\r\nParliament, wherein we as head and you as members are conjoined and\r\nknit together in one body politic, so as whatsoever offence or injury\r\nduring that time is offered to the meanest member of the House, is to\r\nbe judged as done against our person and the whole Court of\r\nParliament.\"[725] He was careful to observe himself the deference to\r\nparliamentary privilege which he exacted from others. It is no     (p. 259)\r\nstrange aberration from the general tenor of his rule that in 1512\r\nby Strode's case[726] the freedom of speech of members of Parliament\r\nwas established, and their freedom from arrest by Ferrers' case in\r\n1543. In 1515 Convocation had enviously petitioned for the same\r\nliberty of speech as was enjoyed in Parliament, where members might\r\neven attack the law of the land and not be called in question\r\ntherefor.[727] \"I am,\" writes Bishop Gardiner, in 1547, apologising\r\nfor the length of a letter, \"like one of the Commons' house, that,\r\nwhen I am in my tale, think I should have liberty to make an\r\nend;\"[728] and again he refers to a speech he made during Henry's\r\nreign \"in the Parliament house, _where was free speech without\r\ndanger_\".[729] Wolsey had raised a storm in 1523 by trying to browbeat\r\nthe House of Commons. Henry never erred in that respect. In 1532 a\r\nmember moved that Henry should take back Catherine to wife.[730]\r\nNothing could have touched the King on a tenderer spot. Charles I.,\r\nfor a less offence, would have gone to the House to arrest the     (p. 260)\r\noffender. All Henry did was to argue the point of his marriage with\r\nthe Speaker and a deputation from the Commons; no proceedings whatever\r\nwere taken against the member himself. In 1529 John Petit, one of the\r\nmembers for London, opposed the bill releasing Henry from his\r\nobligation to repay the loan; the only result apparently was to\r\nincrease Petit's repute in the eyes of the King, who \"would ask in\r\nParliament time if Petit were on his side\".[731] There is, in fact,\r\nnothing to show that Henry VIII. intimidated his Commons at any time,\r\nor that he packed the Parliament of 1529. Systematic interference in\r\nelections was a later expedient devised by Thomas Cromwell. It was\r\napparently tried during the bye-elections of 1534, and at the general\r\nelections of 1536[732] and 1539. Cromwell then endeavoured to secure\r\na majority in favour of himself and his own particular policy      (p. 261)\r\nagainst the reactionary party in the council. His schemes had created\r\na division among the laity, and rendered necessary recourse to\r\npolitical methods of which there was no need, so long as the laity\r\nremained united against the Church. Nor is it without significance\r\nthat its adoption was shortly followed by Cromwell's fall. Henry did\r\nnot approve of ministers who sought to make a party for themselves.\r\nThe packing of Parliaments has in fact been generally the death-bed\r\nexpedient of a moribund Government. The Stuarts had their \"Undertakers,\"\r\nand the only Parliament of Tudor times which consisted mainly of\r\nGovernment nominees was that gathered by Northumberland on the eve of\r\nhis fall in March, 1553; and that that body was exceptionally\r\nconstituted is obvious from Renard's inquiry in August, 1553, as to\r\nwhether Charles V. would advise his cousin, Queen Mary, to summon a\r\ngeneral Parliament or merely an assembly of \"notables\" after the\r\nmanner introduced by Northumberland.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 724: _L. and P._, i., 2082.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 725: Holinshed, _Chronicles_, iii., 956.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 726: Hallam, _Const.

These very letters show that electors did\r\n                   exercise a vote, and the fact that from 1534 to\r\n                   1539 we find traces of pressure being put upon\r\n                   them, affords some presumption that before the rise\r\n                   of Cromwell, when we find no such traces no such\r\n                   pressure was exerted. The most striking exception\r\n                   must not be taken as the rule. See p. 317 _n._]\r\n\r\nBut, while Parliament was neither packed nor terrorised to any great\r\nextent, the harmony which prevailed between it and the King has\r\nnaturally led to the charge of servility. Insomuch as it was servile\r\nat all, Parliament faithfully represented its constituents; but the\r\nmere coincidence between the wishes of Henry and those of Parliament\r\nis no proof of servility.[733] That accusation can only be         (p. 262)\r\nsubstantiated by showing that Parliament did, not what it wanted, but\r\nwhat it did not want, out of deference to Henry. And that has never\r\nbeen proved. It has never been shown that the nation resented the\r\nstatutes giving Henry's proclamations the force of laws, enabling him\r\nto settle the succession by will, or any of the other acts usually\r\nadduced to prove the subservience of Parliament. When Henry was dead,\r\nProtector Somerset secured the repeal of most of these laws, but he\r\nlost his head for his pains. There is, indeed, no escape from the\r\nconclusion that the English people then approved of a dictatorship,\r\nand that Parliament was acting deliberately and voluntarily when it\r\nmade Henry dictator. It made him dictator because it felt that he\r\nwould do what it wanted, and better with, than without, extraordinary\r\npowers. The fact that Parliament rejected some of Henry's measures is\r\nstrong presumption that it could have rejected more, had it been so\r\nminded. No projects were more dear to Henry's heart than the statutes\r\nof Wills and of Uses, yet both were rejected twice at least in the\r\nParliament of 1529-36.[734]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 733: \"Parliament,\" says Brewer,\r\n                   \"faithfully reflected the King's wishes.\" It is\r\n                   equally true to say that the King reflected the\r\n                   wishes of Parliament; and the accusation of\r\n                   servility is based on the assumption that\r\n                   Parliament must either be in chronic opposition to\r\n                   the Crown or servile. One of Brewer's reasons for\r\n                   Henry's power is that he \"required no grants of\r\n                   money\"! (_L. and P._, iv., Introd., p. dcxlv.).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 734: \"Henry,\" writes Chapuys in 1532,\r\n                   \"has been trying to obtain from Parliament the\r\n                   grant of a third of the feudal property of deceased\r\n                   lords, but as yet has got nothing\" (_L. and P._,\r\n                   v., 805). Various other instances are mentioned in\r\n                   the following pages, and they could doubtless be\r\n                   multiplied if the Journals of the House of Commons\r\n                   were extant for this period.]\r\n\r\nThe general harmony between King and Parliament was based on a\r\nfundamental similarity of interests; the harmony in detail was worked\r\nout, not by the forcible exertion of Henry's will, but by his careful\r\nand skilful manipulation of both Houses. No one was ever a greater\r\nadept in the management of the House of Commons, which is easy     (p. 263)\r\nto humour but hard to drive. Parliaments are jealous bodies, but\r\nthey are generally pleased with attentions; and Henry VIII. was very\r\nassiduous in the attentions he paid to his lay Lords and Commons. From\r\n1529 he suffered no intermediary to come between Parliament and\r\nhimself. Cromwell was more and more employed by the King,[735] but\r\nonly in subordinate matters, and when important questions were at\r\nissue Henry managed the business himself. He constantly visited both\r\nHouses and remained within their precincts for hours at a time,[736]\r\nwatching every move in the game and taking note of every symptom of\r\nparliamentary feeling. He sent no royal commands to his faithful\r\nCommons; in this respect he was less arbitrary than his daughter,\r\nQueen Elizabeth. He submitted points for their consideration, argued\r\nwith them, and frankly gave his reasons. It was always done, of course,\r\nwith a magnificent air of royal condescension, but with such grace (p. 264)\r\nas to carry the conviction that he was really pleased to condescend\r\nand to take counsel with his subjects, and that he did so because he\r\ntrusted his Parliament, and expected his Parliament to place an equal\r\nconfidence in him. Henry VIII. acted more as the leader of both Houses\r\nthan as a King; and, like modern parliamentary leaders, he demanded\r\nthe bulk of their time for measures which he himself proposed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 735: Cromwell used to report to the King\r\n                   on the feeling of Parliament; thus in 1534 (_L. and\r\n                   P._, vii., 51) he tells Henry how far members were\r\n                   willing to go in the creation of fresh treasons,\r\n                   \"they be contented that deed and writing shall be\r\n                   treason,\" but words were to be only misprision;\r\n                   they refused to include an heir's rebellion or\r\n                   disobedience in the bill, \"as rebellion is already\r\n                   treason and disobedience is no cause of forfeiture\r\n                   of inheritance,\" and they thought \"that the King of\r\n                   Scots should in no wise be named\" (there is in the\r\n                   Record Office a draft of the Treasons Bill of 1534\r\n                   materially differing from the Act as passed.\r\n                   Therefore either the bill did not originate with\r\n                   the Government and was modified under Government\r\n                   pressure, or it did originate with the Government\r\n                   and was modified under parliamentary pressure).\r\n                   This is how Henry's legislation was evolved; there\r\n                   is no foundation for the assertion that Parliament\r\n                   merely registered the King's edicts.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 736: _E.g._, _L. and P._, v., 120. At other\r\n                   times Parliament visited him. \"On Thursday last,\"\r\n                   writes one on 8th March, 1534, \"the whole\r\n                   Parliament were with the King at York Place for\r\n                   three hours\" (_ibid._, vii., 304).]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the legislation of Henry's reign was initiated almost\r\nentirely by Government is not, however, a conclusive proof of the\r\nservility of Parliament. For, though it may have been the theory that\r\nParliament existed to pass laws of its own conception, such has never\r\nbeen the practice, except when there has been chronic opposition\r\nbetween the executive and the legislature. Parliament has generally\r\nbeen the instrument of Government, a condition essential to strong and\r\nsuccessful administration; and it is still summoned mainly to discuss\r\nsuch measures as the executive thinks fit to lay before it. Certainly\r\nthe proportion of Government bills to other measures passed in Henry's\r\nreign was less than it is to-day. A private member's bill then stood\r\nmore chance of becoming law, and a Government bill ran greater risks\r\nof being rejected. That, of course, is not the whole truth. One of the\r\nreasons why Henry's House of Commons felt at liberty to reject bills\r\nproposed by the King, was that such rejection did not involve the fall\r\nof a Government which on other grounds the House wished to support. It\r\ndid not even entail a dissolution. Not that general elections possessed\r\nany terrors for sixteenth-century Parliaments. A seat in the House of\r\nCommons was not considered a very great prize. The classes, from   (p. 265)\r\nwhich its members were drawn, were much more bent on the pursuit of\r\ntheir own private fortunes than on participation in public affairs.\r\nTheir membership was not seldom a burden,[737] and the long sessions\r\nof the Reformation Parliament constituted an especial grievance. One\r\nmember complained that those sessions cost him equivalent to about\r\nfive hundred pounds over and above the wages paid him by his\r\nconstituents.[738] Leave to go home was often requested, and the\r\nimperial ambassador records that Henry, with characteristic craft,\r\ngranted such licences to hostile members, but refused them to his own\r\nsupporters.[739] That was a legitimate parliamentary stratagem. It was\r\nnot Henry's fault if members preferred their private concerns to the\r\ninterests of Catherine of Aragon or to the liberties of the Catholic\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 737: Some at least of the royal\r\n                   nominations to Parliament were due to the fact that\r\n                   nothing less than a royal command could produce a\r\n                   representative at all.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 738: _L. and P._, vii., 302.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 739: _Ibid._, v., 120.]\r\n\r\nHenry's greatest advantage lay, however, in a circumstance which\r\nconstitutes the chief real difference between the Parliaments of the\r\nsixteenth century and those of to-day. His members of Parliament were\r\nrepresentatives rather than delegates. They were elected as fit and\r\nproper persons to decide upon such questions as should be submitted to\r\nthem in the Parliament House, and not merely as fit and proper persons\r\nto register decisions already reached by their constituents. Although\r\nthey were in the habit of rendering to their constituents an account\r\nof their proceedings at the close of each session,[740] and although\r\nthe fact that they depended upon their constituencies for their wages\r\nprevented their acting in opposition to their constituents'        (p. 266)\r\nwishes, they received no precise instructions. They went to Parliament\r\nunfettered by definite pledges. They were thus more susceptible, not\r\nonly to pressure, but also to argument; and it is possible that in\r\nthose days votes were sometimes affected by speeches. The action of\r\nmembers was determined, not by previous engagements or party discipline,\r\nbut by their view of the merits and necessities of the case before\r\nthem. Into that view extraneous circumstances, such as fear of the\r\nKing, might to a certain extent intrude; but such evidence as is\r\navailable points decisively to the conclusion that co-operation\r\nbetween the King and Parliament was secured, partly by Parliament\r\ndoing what Henry wanted, and partly by Henry doing what Parliament\r\nwanted. Parliament did not always do as the King desired, nor did the\r\nKing's actions always commend themselves to Parliament. Most of the\r\nmeasures of the Reformation Parliament were matters of give and take.\r\nIt was due to Henry's skill, and to the circumstances of the time that\r\nthe King's taking was always to his own profit, and his giving at the\r\nexpense of the clergy. He secured the support of the Commons for his\r\nown particular ends by promising the redress of their grievances\r\nagainst the bishops and priests. It is said that he instituted the\r\nfamous petitions urged against the clergy in 1532, and it is hinted\r\nthat the abuses, of which those petitions complained, had no real\r\nexistence. No doubt Henry encouraged the Commons' complaints; he had\r\nevery reason to do so, but he did not invent the abuses. If the\r\nCommons did not feel the grievances, the King's promise to redress\r\nthem would be no inducement to Parliament to comply with the royal\r\ndemands. The hostility of the laity to the clergy, arising out     (p. 267)\r\nof these grievances, was in fact the lever with which Henry overthrew\r\nthe papal authority, and the basis upon which he built his own\r\nsupremacy over the Church.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 740: _Cf. ibid._, iv., App. 1.]\r\n\r\nThis anti-ecclesiastical bias on the part of the laity was the\r\ndominant factor in the Reformation under Henry VIII. But the word in\r\nits modern sense is scarcely applicable to the ecclesiastical policy\r\nof that King. Its common acceptation implies a purification of\r\ndoctrine, but it is doubtful whether any idea of interfering with\r\ndogma ever crossed the minds of the monarchs, who, for more than a\r\ngeneration, had been proclaiming the need for a reformation. Their\r\nproposal was to reform the practice of the clergy; and the method they\r\nfavoured most was the abolition of clerical privileges and the\r\nappropriation of ecclesiastical property. The Reformation in England,\r\nso far as it was carried by Henry VIII., was, indeed, neither more nor\r\nless than a violent self-assertion of the laity against the immunities\r\nwhich the Church had herself enjoyed, and the restraints which she\r\nimposed upon others. It was not primarily a breach between the Church\r\nof England and the Roman communion, a repudiation on the part of\r\nEnglish ecclesiastics of a harassing papal yoke; for it is fairly\r\nobvious that under Henry VIII. the Church took no measures against\r\nRome that were not forced on it by the State. It was not till the\r\nreigns of Edward VI. and Elizabeth that the Church accorded a consent,\r\nbased on conviction, to a settlement originally extorted by force. The\r\nReformation was rather a final assertion by the State of its authority\r\nover the Church in England. The breach with the Roman Church, the\r\nrepudiation of papal influence in English ecclesiastical affairs, was\r\nnot a spontaneous clerical movement; it was the effect of the      (p. 268)\r\nsubjection of the Church to the national temporal power. The Church in\r\nEngland had hitherto been a semi-independent part of the political\r\ncommunity. It was semi-national, semi-universal; it owed one sort of\r\nfealty to the universal Pope, and another to the national King. The\r\nrising spirit of nationality could brook no divided allegiance; and\r\nthe universal gave way to the national idea. There was to be no\r\n_imperium in imperio_, but \"one body politic,\"[741] with one Supreme\r\nHead. Henry VIII. is reported by Chapuys as saying that he was King,\r\nEmperor and Pope, all in one, so far as England was concerned.[742]\r\nThe Church was to be nationalised; it was to compromise its universal\r\ncharacter, and to become the Church _of_ England, rather than a branch\r\nof the Church universal _in_ England.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 741: The phrase occurs in Cromwell's\r\n                   draft bill for the submission of Convocation (_L.\r\n                   and P._, v., 721).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 742: _Ibid._, v., 361. This was in\r\n                   reference to Henry's refusal to allow a visitation\r\n                   of the Cistercian monasteries, of which Chapuys\r\n                   thought they stood in great need (31st July,\r\n                   1531).]\r\n\r\nThe revolution was inevitably effected through the action of the State\r\nrather than that of the Church. The Church, which, like religion\r\nitself, is in essence universal and not national, regarded with\r\nabhorrence the prospect of being narrowed and debased to serve\r\npolitical ends. The Church in England had moreover no means and no\r\nweapons wherewith to effect an internal reformation independent of the\r\nPapacy; as well might the Court of King's Bench endeavour to reform\r\nitself without the authority of King and Parliament. The whole\r\njurisdiction of the Church was derived in theory from the Pope; when\r\nWolsey wished to reform the monasteries he had to seek authority from\r\nLeo X.; the Archbishop of Canterbury held a court at Lambeth and   (p. 269)\r\nexercised juridical powers, but he did so as _legatus natus_ of\r\nthe Apostolic See, and not as archbishop, and this authority could at\r\nany time be superseded by that of a legate _a latere_, as Warham's was\r\nby Wolsey's. It was not his own but the delegated jurisdiction of\r\nanother.[743] Bishops and archbishops were only the channels of a\r\njurisdiction flowing from a papal fountain. Henry charged Warham in\r\n1532 with _praemunire_ because he had consecrated the Bishop of St.\r\nAsaph before the Bishop's temporalties had been restored.[744] The\r\nArchbishop in reply stated that he merely acted as commissary of the\r\nPope, \"the act was the Pope's act,\" and he had no discretion of his\r\nown. He was bound to consecrate as soon as the Bishop had been\r\ndeclared such in consistory at Rome. Chapters might elect, the\r\nArchbishop might consecrate, and the King might restore the\r\ntemporalties; but none of these things gave a bishop jurisdiction.\r\nThere were in fact two and only two sources of power and jurisdiction,\r\nthe temporal sovereign and the Pope; reformation must be effected by\r\nthe one or the other. Wolsey had ideas of a national ecclesiastical\r\nreformation, but he could have gone no farther than the Pope, who gave\r\nhim his authority, permitted. Had the Church in England transgressed\r\nthat limit, it would have become dead in schism, and Wolsey's\r\njurisdiction would have _ipso facto_ ceased. Hence the fundamental (p. 270)\r\nimpossibility of Wolsey's scheme; hence the ultimate resort to the\r\nonly alternative, a reformation by the temporal sovereign, which\r\nWycliffe had advocated and which the Anglicans of the sixteenth\r\ncentury justified by deriving the royal supremacy from the authority\r\nconceded by the early Fathers to the Roman Emperor--an authority prior\r\nto the Pope's.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 743: _Cf._ Maitland, _Roman Canon Law_;\r\n                   Pollock and Maitland, _History of English Law_, i.,\r\n                   90 (Bracton regards the Pope as the Englishman's\r\n                   \"Ordinary\"); and Leadam, _Select Cases from the\r\n                   Star Chamber_, Introd., pp. lxxxvi.-viii.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 744: _L. and P._, v., 1247. A curious\r\n                   point about this document, unnoticed by the editor,\r\n                   is that the Bishop of St. Asaph had been\r\n                   consecrated as far back as 1518, and that he was\r\n                   the Standish who had played so conspicuous a part\r\n                   in the early Church and State disputes of Henry's\r\n                   reign. This is an echo of the \"Investiture\"\r\n                   controversy (Luchaire, _Manuel_, pp. 509, 510).]\r\n\r\nHence, too, the agency employed was Parliament and not\r\nConvocation.[745] The representatives of the clergy met of course as\r\nfrequently as those of the laity, but their activity was purely\r\ndefensive. They suggested no changes themselves, and endeavoured\r\nwithout much success to resist the innovations forced upon them by\r\nKing and by Parliament. They had every reason to fear both Henry and\r\nthe Commons. They were conscious that the Church had lost its hold\r\nupon the nation. Its impotence was due in part to its own corruption,\r\nin part to the fact that thriving commercial and industrial classes,\r\nlike those which elected Tudor Parliaments, are as a rule impatient of\r\nreligious or at least sacerdotal dictation. God and Mammon, in spite\r\nof all efforts at compromise, do not really agree. In 1529, before the\r\nmeeting of Parliament, Campeggio had appealed to Henry to prevent the\r\nruin of the Church; he felt that without State protection the Church\r\ncould hardly stand. In 1531 Warham, the successor of Becket and\r\nLangton, excused his compliance with Henry's demands by pleading   (p. 271)\r\n_Ira principis mors est_.[746] In the draft of a speech he drew up\r\njust before his death,[747] the Archbishop referred to the case of St.\r\nThomas, hinted that Henry VIII. was going the way of Henry II., and\r\ncompared his policy with the constitutions of Clarendon. The comparison\r\nwas extraordinarily apt; Henry VIII. was doing what Henry II. had\r\nfailed to do, and the fate that attended the Angevin king might have\r\nbefallen the Tudor had Warham been Becket and the Church of the\r\nsixteenth been the same as the Church of the twelfth century. But they\r\nwere not, and Warham appealed in vain to the liberties of the Church\r\ngranted by Magna Carta, and to the \"ill end\" of \"several kings who\r\nviolated them\". Laymen, he complained, now \"advanced\" their own laws\r\nrather than those of the Church. The people, admitted so staunch a\r\nchurchman as Pole, were beginning to hate the priests.[748] \"There\r\nwere,\" wrote Norfolk, \"infinite clamours of the temporalty here in\r\nParliament against the misuse of the spiritual jurisdiction.... This\r\nrealm did never grudge the tenth part against the abuses of the Church\r\nat no Parliament in my days, as they do now.\"[749]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 745: \"It was not from Parliament,\" says\r\n                   Brewer (_L. and P._, iv., Introd., p. dcxlvii.),\r\n                   \"but from Convocation that the King had to\r\n                   anticipate any show of independence or opposition.\"\r\n                   True, to some extent; but the fact does not prove,\r\n                   as Brewer alleges, that Convocation was more\r\n                   independent than Parliament, but that Henry was\r\n                   doing what Parliament liked and Convocation\r\n                   disliked.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 746: \"The Queen replied that they were\r\n                   all fine councillors, for when she asked advice of\r\n                   the Archbishop of Canterbury, he replied that he\r\n                   would not meddle in these affairs, saying\r\n                   frequently, _Ira principis mors est_\" (Chapuys to\r\n                   Charles V., 6th June, 1531).

The likeness between\r\n                   Henry VIII. and Henry II. extended beyond their\r\n                   policy to their personal characteristics, and the\r\n                   great Angevin was much in the Tudor's mind at this\r\n                   period.

(_ibid._, vii., 94).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 748: _L. and P._, v., App. 10.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 749: _Ibid._, v., 831; _cf._ v., 898,\r\n                   989, App. 28.]\r\n\r\nThese infinite clamours and grudging were not the result of the    (p. 272)\r\nconscientious rejection of any Catholic or papal doctrine. Englishmen\r\nare singularly free from the bondage of abstract ideas, and they began\r\ntheir Reformation not with the enunciation of some new truth, but with\r\nan attack on clerical fees. Reform was stimulated by a practical\r\ngrievance, closely connected with money, and not by a sense of wrong\r\ndone to the conscience. No dogma plays such a part in the English\r\nReformation as Justification by Faith did in Germany, or Predestination\r\nin Switzerland. Parliament in 1530 had not been appreciably affected\r\nby Tyndale's translation of the Bible or by any of Luther's works.\r\nTyndale was still an exile in the Netherlands, pleading in vain for\r\nthe same toleration in England as Charles V. permitted across the sea.\r\nFrith was in the Tower--a man, wrote the lieutenant, Walsingham, whom\r\nit would be a great pity to lose, if only he could be reconciled[750]--and\r\nBilney was martyred in 1531. A parliamentary inquiry was threatened in\r\nthe latter case, not because Parliament sympathised with Bilney's\r\ndoctrine, but because it was said that the clergy had procured his\r\nburning before obtaining the State's consent.[751] Parliament was as\r\nzealous as Convocation against heresy, but wanted the punishment of\r\nheretics left in secular hands.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 750: _L. and P._, v., 1458.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 751: _Ibid._, v., 522; vii., 171.]\r\n\r\nIn this, as in other respects, the King and his Parliament were in the\r\nfullest agreement. Henry had already given proof of his anti-clerical\r\nbias by substituting laymen for churchmen in those great offices of\r\nState which churchmen had usually held. From time immemorial the Lord\r\nChancellor had been a Bishop,[752] but in 1529 Wolsey was succeeded\r\nby More, and, later on, More by Audley. Similarly, the privy seal  (p. 273)\r\nhad been held in Henry's reign by three bishops successively, Fox,\r\nRuthal and Tunstall: now it was entrusted to the hands of Anne\r\nBoleyn's father, the Earl of Wiltshire. Gardiner remained secretary\r\nfor the time, but Du Bellay thought his power would have increased had\r\nhe abandoned his clerical vows,[753] and he, too, was soon superseded\r\nby Cromwell. Even the clerkship of Parliament was now given up to a\r\nlayman. During the first half of Henry's reign clerical influence had\r\nbeen supreme in Henry's councils; during the second it was almost\r\nentirely excluded. Like his Parliament, he was now impugning the\r\njurisdiction of the clergy in the matter of heresy; they were doctors,\r\nhe said, of the soul, and had nothing to do with the body.[754] He was\r\neven inclining to the very modern theory that marriage is a civil\r\ncontract, and that matrimonial suits should therefore be removed from\r\nclerical cognisance.[755] As early as 1529 he ordered Wolsey to\r\nrelease the Prior of Reading, who had been imprisoned for Lutheranism,\r\n\"unless the matter is very heinous\".[756] In 1530 he was praising\r\nLatimer's sermons;[757] and in the same year the Bishop of Norwich\r\ncomplained of a general report in his diocese that Henry favoured\r\nheretical books.[758] \"They say that, wherever they go, they hear that\r\nthe King's pleasure is that the New Testament in English shall     (p. 274)\r\ngo forth.\" There seems little reason to doubt Hall's statement that\r\nHenry now commanded the bishops, who, however, did nothing, to prepare\r\nan English translation of the Bible to counteract the errors of\r\nTyndale's version.[759] He wrote to the German princes extolling their\r\nefforts towards the reformation of the Church;[760] and many advisers\r\nwere urging him to begin a similar movement in England. Anne Boleyn\r\nand her father were, said Chapuys, more Lutheran than Luther himself;\r\nthey were the true apostles of the new sect in England.[761]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 752: Thomas Beaufort, afterwards Duke of\r\n                   Exeter, who was Chancellor in 1410-12, and Richard,\r\n                   Earl of Salisbury, who was Chancellor in 1454-5,\r\n                   are exceptions.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 753: _L. and P._, iv., 6019.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 754: _Ibid._, v., 1013.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 755: _Ibid._, v., 805; vii., 232. Chapuys\r\n                   had told him that \"all the Parliament could not\r\n                   make the Princess Mary a bastard, for the\r\n                   cognisance of cases concerning legitimacy belonged\r\n                   to ecclesiastical judges\"; to which Henry replied\r\n                   that \"he did not care for all the canons which\r\n                   might be alleged, as he preferred his laws\r\n                   according to which he should have illegitimacy\r\n                   judged by lay judges who could also take cognisance\r\n                   of matrimonial causes\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 756: _L. and P._, iv., 5925.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 757: _Ibid._, iv., 6325.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 758: _Ibid._, iv., 6385.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 759: The net result at the time was a\r\n                   royal proclamation promising an authorised version\r\n                   of the Scriptures in English \"if the people would\r\n                   come to a better mind\" (_L. and P._, iv., 6487).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 760: _L. and P._, v., App. 7.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 761: _Ibid._, v., 148, 850.]\r\n\r\nBut, however Lutheran Anne Boleyn may have been, Henry was still true\r\nto the orthodox faith. If he dallied with German princes, and held out\r\nhopes to his heretic subjects, it was not because he believed in the\r\ndoctrines of either, but because both might be made to serve his own\r\nends. He rescued Crome from the flames, not because he doubted or\r\nfavoured Crome's heresy, but because Crome appealed from the Church to\r\nthe King, and denied the papal supremacy; that, said Henry, is not\r\nheresy, but truth.[762] When he sent to Oxford for the articles on\r\nwhich Wycliffe had been condemned,[763] it was not to study the great\r\nReformer's doctrine of the mass, but to discover Wycliffe's reasons\r\nfor calling upon the State to purify a corrupt Church, and to digest\r\nhis arguments against the temporal wealth of the clergy. When he\r\nlauded the reforms effected by the German princes he was thinking of\r\ntheir secularisation of ecclesiastical revenues. The spoliation    (p. 275)\r\nof the Church was consistent with the most fervent devotion to its\r\ntenets. In 1531 Henry warned the Pope that the Emperor would probably\r\nallow the laity \"to appropriate the possessions of the Church, which\r\nis a matter which does not touch the foundations of the faith; and\r\nwhat an example this will afford to others, it is easy to see\".[764]\r\nHenry managed to improve upon Charles's example in this respect. \"He\r\nmeant,\" he told Chapuys in 1533, \"to repair the errors of Henry II.\r\nand John, who, being in difficulties, had made England and Ireland\r\ntributary to the Pope; he was determined also to reunite to the Crown\r\nthe goods which churchmen held of it, which his predecessors could not\r\nalienate to his prejudice; and he was bound to do this by the oath he\r\nhad taken at his coronation.\"[765] Probably it was about this time, or\r\na little later, that he drew up his suggestions for altering the\r\ncoronation oath, and making the royal obligations binding only so far\r\nas the royal conscience thought fit. The German princes had a further\r\nclaim to his consideration beyond the example they set him in dealing\r\nwith the temporalties of the Church. They might be very useful if his\r\ndifference with Charles over Catherine of Aragon came to an open\r\nbreach; and the English envoys, who congratulated them on their zeal\r\nfor reform, also endeavoured to persuade them that Henry's friendship\r\nmight be no little safeguard against a despotic Emperor.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 762: _Ibid._, v., 129, 148.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 763: _Ibid._, iv., 6546.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 764: _L. and P._, v., 326.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 765: _Ibid._, vi., 235.]\r\n\r\nAll these phenomena, the Reformation in Germany, heresy at home, and\r\nthe anti-sacerdotal prejudices of his subjects, were regarded by Henry\r\nmerely as circumstances which might be made subservient to his own\r\nparticular purpose; and the skill with which he used them is a     (p. 276)\r\nmonument of farsighted statecraft.[766] He did not act on the impulse\r\nof rash caprice. His passions were strong, but his self-control was\r\nstronger; and the breach with Rome was effected with a cold and\r\ncalculated cunning, which the most adept disciple of Machiavelli could\r\nnot have excelled. He did not create the factors he used; hostility to\r\nthe Church had a real objective existence. Henry was a great man; but\r\nthe burdens his people felt were not the product of Henry's hypnotic\r\nsuggestion. He could only divert those grievances to his own use. He\r\nhad no personal dislike to probate dues or annates; he did not pay\r\nthem, but the threat of their abolition might compel the Pope to grant\r\nhis divorce. Heresy in itself was abominable, but if heretics would\r\nmaintain the royal against the papal supremacy, might not their sins\r\nbe forgiven? The strength of Henry's position lay in the fact that he\r\nstood between two evenly balanced parties. It is obvious that by\r\nfavouring the anti-clericals he could destroy the power of the Church.\r\nIt is not so certain, but it is probable that, by supporting the\r\nChurch, he could have staved off its ruin so long as he lived.\r\nParliament might have been urgent, but there was no necessity to call\r\nit together. The Reformation Parliament, which sat for seven years,\r\nwould probably have been dissolved after a few weeks had Clement\r\ngranted the divorce. It met session after session, to pass one measure\r\nafter another, each of which was designed to put fresh pressure on the\r\nPope. It began with the outworks of the papal fortress; as soon    (p. 277)\r\nas one was dismantled, Henry cried \"Halt,\" to see if the citadel\r\nwould surrender. When it refused, the attack recommenced. First one,\r\nthen another of the Church's privileges and the Pope's prerogatives\r\ndisappeared, till there remained not one stone upon another of the\r\nimposing edifice of ecclesiastical liberty and papal authority in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 766: _Cf._ A. Zimmermann, \"Zur\r\n                   kirchlichen Politik Heinrichs VIII., nach den\r\n                   Trennung vom Rom,\" in _Roemische Quartalschrift_,\r\n                   xiii., 263-283.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.                                                        (p. 278)\r\n\r\n\"DOWN WITH THE CHURCH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reformation Parliament met for its first session on the 3rd of\r\nNovember, 1529, at the Black Friars' Hall in London.[767] No careful\r\nobserver was in any doubt as to what its temper would be with regard\r\nto the Church. It was opened by the King in person, and the new Lord\r\nChancellor, Sir Thomas More, delivered an address in which he\r\ndenounced his predecessor, Wolsey, in scathing terms.[768] Parliament\r\nhad been summoned, he said, to reform such things as had been used or\r\npermitted in England by inadvertence. On the following day both Houses\r\nadjourned to Westminster on account of the plague, and the Commons\r\nchose, as their Speaker, Sir Thomas Audley, the future Lord Chancellor.\r\nOne of their first duties was to consider a bill of attainder against\r\nWolsey,[769] and the fate of that measure seems to be destructive of\r\none or the other of two favourite theories respecting Henry VIII.'s\r\nParliaments. The bill was opposed in the Commons by Cromwell and\r\nthrown out; either it was not a mere expression of the royal will, or\r\nParliament was something more than the tool of the Court. For it is\r\nhardly credible that Henry first caused the bill to be introduced,\r\nand then ordered its rejection. The next business was Henry's      (p. 279)\r\nrequest for release from the obligation to repay the loan which Wolsey\r\nhad raised; that, too, the Commons refused, except on conditions.[770]\r\nBut no such opposition greeted the measures for reforming the\r\nclergy.[771] Bills were passed in the Commons putting a limit on the\r\nfees exacted by bishops for probate, and for the performance of other\r\nduties then regarded as spiritual functions. The clergy were\r\nprohibited from holding pluralities, except in certain cases, but the\r\nact was drawn with astonishing moderation; it did not apply to\r\nbenefices acquired before 1530, unless they exceeded the number of\r\nfour. Penalties against non-residents were enacted, and an attempt was\r\nmade to check the addiction of spiritual persons to commercial\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 767: _L. and P._, iv., 6043-44.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 768: Hall, _Chronicle_, p. 764.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 769: _L. and P._, iv., 6075.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 770: That it passed at all is often\r\n                   considered proof of parliamentary servility; it is\r\n                   rather an illustration of the typical Tudor policy\r\n                   of burdening the wealthy few in order to spare the\r\n                   general public. If repayment of the loan were\r\n                   exacted, fresh taxation would be necessary, which\r\n                   would fall on many more than had lent the King\r\n                   money. It was very irregular, but the burden was\r\n                   thus placed on the shoulders of those individuals\r\n                   who benefited most by Henry's ecclesiastical and\r\n                   general policy and were rapidly accumulating\r\n                   wealth. Taxation on the whole was remarkably light\r\n                   during Tudor times; the tenths, fifteenths and\r\n                   subsidies had become fixed sums which did not\r\n                   increase with the national wealth, and indeed\r\n                   brought in less and less to the royal exchequer\r\n                   (see _L. and P._, vii., 344, \"considerations why\r\n                   subsidies in diverse shires were not so good in\r\n                   Henry's seventh year as in his fifth\"; _cf._ vii.,\r\n                   1490, and xix., ii., 689, where Paget says that\r\n                   benevolences did not \"grieve the common people\").]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 771: _L. and P._, iv., 6083.]\r\n\r\nThese reforms seem reasonable enough, but the idea of placing a bound\r\nto the spiritual exaction of probate seemed sacrilege to Bishop\r\nFisher. \"My lords,\" he cried, \"you see daily what bills come hither\r\nfrom the Common House, and all is to the destruction of the        (p. 280)\r\nChurch. For God's sake, see what a realm the kingdom of Bohemia was;\r\nand when the Church went down, then fell the glory of the kingdom. Now\r\nwith the Commons is nothing but 'Down with the Church!' And all this,\r\nmeseemeth, is for lack of faith only.\"[772] The Commons thought a\r\nlimitation of fees an insufficient ground for a charge of heresy, and\r\ncomplained of Fisher to the King through the mouth of their Speaker.\r\nThe Bishop explained away the offensive phrase, but the spiritual\r\npeers succeeded in rejecting the Commons' bills. The way out of the\r\ndeadlock was suggested by the King; he proposed a conference between\r\neight members of either House. The Lords' delegates were half\r\nspiritual, half temporal, peers.[773] Henry knew well enough that the\r\nCommons would vote solidly for the measures, and that the temporal\r\npeers would support them. They did so; the bills were passed; and, on\r\n17th December, Parliament was prorogued. We may call it a trick or\r\nskilful parliamentary strategy; the same trick, played by the _Tiers\r\nEtat_ in 1789, ensured the success of the French Revolution, and it\r\nwas equally effective in England in 1529.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 772: Hall, _Chronicle_, p. 766.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 773: _Cf._ Stubbs, _Lectures_, 1887, p.\r\n                   317.]\r\n\r\nThese mutterings of the storm fell on deaf ears at Rome. Clement was\r\ndeaf, not because he had not ears to hear, but because the clash of\r\nimperial arms drowned more distant sounds. \"If any one,\" wrote the\r\nBishop of Auxerre in 1531, \"was ever in prison or in the power of his\r\nenemies, the Pope is now.\"[774] He was as anxious as ever to escape\r\nresponsibility. \"He has told me,\" writes the Bishop of Tarbes to\r\nFrancis I. on the 27th of March, 1530, \"more than three times in   (p. 281)\r\nsecret that he would be glad if the marriage (with Anne Boleyn) was\r\nalready made, either by a dispensation of the English legate or\r\notherwise, provided it was not by his authority, or in diminution of\r\nhis power as to dispensation and limitation of Divine law.\"[775] Later\r\nin the year he made his suggestion that Henry should have two wives\r\nwithout prejudice to the legitimacy of the children of either. Henry,\r\nhowever, would listen to neither suggestion.[776] He would be\r\nsatisfied with nothing less than the sanction of the highest authority\r\nrecognised in England. When it became imperative that his marriage\r\nwith Anne should be legally sanctioned, and evident that no such\r\nsanction would be forthcoming from Rome, he arranged that the highest\r\necclesiastical authority recognised by law in England should be that\r\nof the Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 774: _L. and P._, v., 562.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 775: _L. and P._, iv., 6290.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 776: See above p. 207.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the exigencies of the struggle drove Clement into\r\nassertions of papal prerogative which would at any time have provoked\r\nan outburst of national anger. On 7th March, 1530, he promulgated a\r\nbull to be affixed to the church doors at Bruges, Tournay and Dunkirk,\r\ninhibiting Henry, under pain of the greater excommunication, from\r\nproceeding to that second marriage, which he was telling the Bishop of\r\nTarbes he wished Henry would complete.[777] A fortnight later he\r\nissued a second bull forbidding all ecclesiastical judges, doctors,\r\nadvocates and others to speak or write against the validity of Henry's\r\nmarriage with Catherine.[778] If he had merely desired to prohibit\r\ndiscussion of a matter under judicial consideration, he should have\r\nimposed silence also on the advocates of the marriage, and not     (p. 282)\r\nleft Fisher free to write books against the King and secretly send\r\nthem to Spain to be printed.[779] On the 23rd of December following it\r\nwas decreed in Consistory at Rome that briefs should be granted\r\nprohibiting the Archbishop of Canterbury from taking cognisance of the\r\nsuit, and forbidding Henry to cohabit with any other woman than\r\nCatherine, and \"all women in general to contract marriage with the\r\nKing of England\".[780] On the 5th of January, 1531, the Pope inhibited\r\nlaity as well as clergy, universities, parliaments and courts of law\r\nfrom coming to any decision in the case.[781]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 777: _L. and P._, iv., 6256.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 778: _Ibid._, iv., 6279.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 779: _L. and P._, iv., 6199, 6596, 6738;\r\n                   v., 460.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 780: _Ibid._, iv., 6772.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 781: _Ibid._, v., 27.]\r\n\r\nTo these fulminations the ancient laws of England provided Henry with\r\nsufficient means of reply. \"Let not the Pope suppose,\" wrote Henry to\r\nClement, \"that either the King or his nobles will allow the fixed laws\r\nof his kingdom to be set aside.\"[782] A proclamation, based on the\r\nStatutes of Provisors, was issued on 12th September, 1530, forbidding\r\nthe purchasing from the Court of Rome or the publishing of any thing\r\nprejudicial to the realm, or to the King's intended purposes;[783] and\r\nNorfolk was sent to remind the papal nuncio of the penalties attaching\r\nto the importation of bulls into England without the King's consent.\r\nBut the most notorious expedient of Henry's was the appeal to the\r\nuniversities of Europe, first suggested by Cranmer.[784] Throughout\r\n1530 English agents were busy abroad obtaining decisions from      (p. 283)\r\nthe universities on the question of the Pope's power to dispense with\r\nthe law against marrying a deceased brother's wife. Their success was\r\nconsiderable. Paris and Orleans, Bourges and Toulouse, Bologna and\r\nFerrara, Pavia and Padua, all decided against the Pope.[785] Similar\r\nverdicts, given by Oxford and Cambridge, may be as naturally ascribed\r\nto intimidation by Henry, as may the decisions of Spanish universities\r\nin the Pope's favour to pressure from Charles; but the theory that all\r\nthe French and Italian universities were bribed is not very credible.\r\nThe cajolery, the threats and the bribes were not all on one side; and\r\nin Italy at least the imperial agents would seem to have enjoyed\r\ngreater facilities than Henry's. In some individual cases there was,\r\nno doubt, resort to improper inducements; but, if the majority in the\r\nmost famous seats of learning in Europe could be induced by filthy\r\nlucre to vote against their conscience, it implies a greater need for\r\ndrastic reformation than the believers in the theory of corruption are\r\nusually disposed to admit. Their decisions were, however, given on\r\ngeneral grounds; the question of the consummation of Catherine's\r\nmarriage with Arthur seems to have been carefully excluded. How far\r\nthat consideration would have affected the votes of the universities\r\ncan only be assumed; but it does not appear to have materially\r\ninfluenced the view taken by Catherine's advocates. They allowed that\r\nCatherine's oath would not be considered sufficient evidence in a\r\ncourt of law; they admitted the necessity of proving that urgent\r\nreasons existed for the grant of the dispensation, and the only    (p. 284)\r\nurgent reason they put forward was an entirely imaginary imminence of\r\nwar between Henry VII. and Ferdinand in 1503. Cardinal Du Bellay, in\r\n1534, asserted that no one would be so bold as to maintain in Consistory\r\nthat the dispensation ever was valid;[786] and the papalists were\r\ndriven to the extreme contention, which was certainly not then\r\nadmitted by Catholic Europe, that, whether the marriage with Arthur\r\nwas merely a form or not, whether it was or was not against Divine\r\nlaw, the Pope could, of his absolute power, dispense.[787]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 782: _Ibid._, iv., 6759.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 783: _Ibid._, iv., 6615; v., 45.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 784: See the present writer's _Cranmer_,\r\n                   pp. 39-41. Cranmer's suggestion was made early in\r\n                   August, 1529, and on the 23rd Du Bellay writes that\r\n                   Wolsey and the King \"appeared to desire very much\r\n                   that I should go over to France to get the opinions\r\n                   of the learned men there about the divorce\" (_L.\r\n                   and P._, iv., 5862). In October Stokesley was sent\r\n                   to France and Croke to Italy (_ibid._, p. 2684);\r\n                   Cranmer did not start till 1530.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 785: _L. and P._, iv., 6332, 6448, 6491,\r\n                   6632, 6636.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 786: _L. and P._, vii., App. 12.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 787: _Ibid._, v., 468.]\r\n\r\nPending the result of Henry's appeal to the universities, little was\r\ndone in the matter in England. The lords spiritual and temporal signed\r\nin June, 1530, a letter to the Pope urging him to comply with their\r\nKing's request for a divorce.[788] Parliament did not meet until 16th\r\nJanuary, 1531, and even then Chapuys reports that it was employed on\r\nnothing more important than cross-bows and hand-guns, the act against\r\nwhich was not, however, passed till 1534. The previous session had\r\nshown that, although the Commons might demur to fiscal exactions, they\r\nwere willing enough to join Henry in any attack on the Church, and the\r\nquestion was how to bring the clergy to a similar state of\r\nacquiescence. It was naturally a more difficult task, but Henry's\r\ningenuity provided a sufficient inducement. His use of the statutes of\r\n_praemunire_ was very characteristic. It was conservative, it was\r\nlegal, and it was unjust. Those statutes were no innovation designed\r\nto meet his particular case; they had been for centuries the law of\r\nthe land; and there was no denying the fact that the clergy had broken\r\nthe law by recognising Wolsey as legate. Henry, of course, had     (p. 285)\r\nlicensed Wolsey to act as legate, and to punish the clergy for an\r\noffence, at which he had connived, was scarcely consistent with\r\njustice; but no King ever showed so clearly how the soundest\r\nconstitutional maxims could be used to defeat the pleas of equity; it\r\nwas frequently laid down during his reign that no licence from the\r\nKing could be pleaded against penalties imposed by statute, and not a\r\nfew parliamentary privileges were first asserted by Henry VIII.[789]\r\nSo the clergy were cunningly caught in the meshes of the law. Chapuys\r\ndeclares that no one could understand the mysteries of _praemunire_;\r\n\"its interpretation lies solely in the King's head, who amplifies it\r\nand declares it at his pleasure, making it apply to any case he\r\npleases\". He at least saw how _praemunire_ could be made to serve his\r\npurposes.[790]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 788: _Ibid._, iv., 6513.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 789: _Cf. L. and P._, iv., 6199. Chapuys\r\n                   writes on 6th February, 1530, \"I am told the King\r\n                   did not wish the Cardinal's case to be tried by\r\n                   Parliament, as, if it had been decided against him,\r\n                   the King could not have pardoned him\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 790: _Ibid._, iv., 6488, 6699.]\r\n\r\nThese, at the moment, were two. He wanted to extract from the clergy a\r\nrecognition of his supremacy over the Church, and he wanted money. He\r\nwas always in need of supplies, but especially now, in case war should\r\narise from the Pope's refusal to grant his divorce; and Henry made it\r\na matter of principle that the Church should pay for wars due to the\r\nPope.[791] The penalty for _praemunire_ was forfeiture of goods and\r\nimprisonment, and the King probably thought he was unduly lenient in\r\ngranting a pardon for a hundred thousand pounds, when he might     (p. 286)\r\nhave taken the whole of the clergy's goods and put them in gaol as\r\nwell. The clergy objected strongly; in the old days of the Church's\r\ninfluence they would all have preferred to go to prison, and a\r\nunanimous refusal of the King's demands would even now have baulked\r\nhis purpose. But the spirit was gone out of them. Chapuys instigated\r\nthe papal nuncio to go down to Convocation and stiffen the backs of\r\nthe clergy.[792] They were horrified at his appearance, and besought\r\nhim to depart in haste, fearing lest this fresh constitutional breach\r\nshould be visited on their heads. Warham frightened them with the\r\nterrors of royal displeasure; and the clerics had to content their\r\nconscience with an Irish bull and a subterfuge. \"Silence gives\r\nconsent,\" said the Archbishop when putting the question; \"Then are we\r\nall silent,\" cried the clergy. To their recognition of Henry as\r\nSupreme Head of the Church, they added the salvo \"so far as the law of\r\nChrist allows\". It was an empty phrase, thought Chapuys, for no one\r\nwould venture to dispute with the King the point where his supremacy\r\nended and that of Christ began;[793] there was in fact \"a new Papacy\r\nmade here\".[794] The clergy repented of the concession as soon as it\r\nwas granted; they were \"more conscious every day,\" wrote Chapuys,  (p. 287)\r\n\"of the great error they committed in acknowledging the King as\r\nsovereign of the Church\"; and they made a vain, and not very creditable,\r\neffort to get rejected by spiritual votes in the House of Lords the\r\nmeasures to which they had given their assent in Convocation.[795] The\r\nChurch had surrendered with scarcely a show of fight; henceforth Henry\r\nmight feel sure that, whatever opposition he might encounter in other\r\nquarters, the Church in England would offer no real resistance.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 791: _Cf. ibid._, vi., 1381 [3], \"that if\r\n                   the Pope attempts war, the King shall have a moiety\r\n                   of the temporal lands of the Church for his\r\n                   defence\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 792: _L. and P._, v., 62. Dr. Stubbs\r\n                   (_Lectures_, 1887, p. 318) represents the nuncio as\r\n                   being pressed into the King's service, and the\r\n                   clergy as resisting him as the Commons had done\r\n                   Wolsey in 1523. But this independence is imaginary;\r\n                   \"it was agreed,\" writes Chapuys, \"between the\r\n                   nuncio and me that he should go to the said\r\n                   ecclesiastics in their congregation and recommend\r\n                   them to support the immunity of the Church.... They\r\n                   were all utterly astonished and scandalised, and\r\n                   without allowing him to open his mouth they begged\r\n                   him to leave them in peace, for they had not the\r\n                   King's leave to speak with him.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 793: _L. and P._, v., 105.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 794: _Ibid._, v., 112.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 795: _L. and P._, v., 124.]\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, notwithstanding Chapuys' remark on the triviality of\r\nits business, more than a score of acts were passed, some limiting\r\nsuch abuses as the right of sanctuary, some dealing in the familiar\r\nway with social evils like the increase of beggars and vagabonds. The\r\nact depriving sanctuary-men, who committed felony, of any further\r\nprotection from their sanctuary was recommended to Parliament by the\r\nKing in person. So was a curious act making poisoning treason.[796]\r\nThere had recently been an attempt to poison Fisher, which the King\r\nbrought before the House of Lords. However familiar poisoning might be\r\nat Rome, it was a novel method in England, and was considered so\r\nheinous a crime that the ordinary penalties for murder were thought to\r\nbe insufficient. Then the King's pardon to the clergy was embodied in\r\na parliamentary bill. The Commons perceived that they were not\r\nincluded, took alarm, and refused to pass the bill. Henry at first\r\nassumed a superior tone; he pointed out that the Commons could not\r\nprevent his pardoning the clergy; he could do it as well under the\r\nGreat Seal as by statute. The Commons, however, were not satisfied.\r\n\"There was great murmuring among them,\" says Chapuys, \"in the      (p. 288)\r\nHouse of Commons, where it was publicly said in the presence of\r\nsome of the Privy Council that the King had burdened and oppressed his\r\nkingdom with more imposts and exactions than any three or four of his\r\npredecessors, and that he ought to consider that the strength of the\r\nKing lay in the affections of his people. And many instances were\r\nalleged of the inconveniences which had happened to princes through\r\nthe ill-treatment of their subjects.\"[797] Henry was too shrewd to\r\nattempt to punish this very plain speaking. He knew that his faithful\r\nCommons were his one support, and he yielded at once. \"On learning\r\nthis,\" continues Chapuys, \"the King granted the exemption which was\r\npublished in Parliament on Wednesday last without any reservation.\"\r\nThe two acts for the pardon of the spiritualty and temporalty were\r\npassed concurrently. But, whereas the clergy had paid for their pardon\r\nwith a heavy fine and the loss of their independence, the laity paid\r\nnothing at all. The last business of the session was the reading of\r\nthe sentences in Henry's favour obtained from the universities.[798]\r\nParliament was then prorogued, and its members were enjoined to relate\r\nto their constituents that which they had seen and heard.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 796: _Ibid._, v., 120.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 797: _L. and P._, v., 171. This and other\r\n                   incidents (see p. 289) form a singular comment on\r\n                   Brewer's assertion (_ibid._, iv., Introd., p.\r\n                   dcxlvii.) that \"there is scarcely an instance on\r\n                   record, in this or any succeeding Parliament\r\n                   throughout the reign, of a parliamentary patriot\r\n                   protesting against a single act of the Crown,\r\n                   however unjust and tyrannical it might be\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 798: _L. and P._, v., 171.]\r\n\r\nPrimed by communion with their neighbours, members of Parliament\r\nassembled once more on 15th January, 1532, for more important      (p. 289)\r\nbusiness than they had yet transacted. Every effort was made to secure\r\na full attendance of Peers and Commons; almost all the lords would be\r\npresent, thought Chapuys, except Tunstall, who had not been summoned;\r\nFisher came without a summons, and apparently no effort was made to\r\nexclude him.[799] The readiness of the Commons to pass measures\r\nagainst the Church, and their reluctance to consent to taxation, were\r\neven more marked than before. Their critical spirit was shown by their\r\nrepeated rejection of the Statutes of Wills and Uses designed by Henry\r\nto protect from evasion his feudal rights, such as reliefs and primer\r\nseisins.[800] This demand, writes Chapuys,[801] \"has been the occasion\r\nof strange words against the King and the Council, and in spite of all\r\nthe efforts of the King's friends, it was rejected\".[802] In the\r\nmatter of supplies they were equally outspoken; they would only grant\r\none-tenth and one-fifteenth, a trifling sum which Henry refused to\r\naccept.[803] It was during this debate on the question of supplies\r\nthat two members moved that the King be asked to take back Catherine\r\nas his wife.[804] They would then, they urged, need no fresh armaments\r\nand their words are reported to have been well received by the House.\r\nThe Commons were not more enthusiastic about the bill restraining the\r\npayment of annates to the Court at Rome.[805] They did not pay     (p. 290)\r\nthem; their grievance was against bishops in England, and they saw\r\nno particular reason for relieving those prelates of their financial\r\nburdens. Cromwell wrote to Gardiner that he did not know how the\r\nannates bill would succeed;[806] and the King had apparently to use\r\nall his persuasion to get the bill through the Lords and the Commons.\r\nOnly temporal lords voted for it in the Upper House, and, in the\r\nLower, recourse was had to the rare expedient of a division.[807] In\r\nboth Houses the votes were taken in the King's presence. But it is\r\nalmost certain that his influence was brought to bear, not so much in\r\nfavour of the principle of the bill, as of the extremely ingenious\r\nclause which left the execution of the Act in Henry's discretion, and\r\nprovided him with a powerful means of putting pressure on the Pope.\r\nThat was Henry's statement of the matter. He told Chapuys, before the\r\nbill was passed, that the attack on annates was being made without his\r\nconsent;[808] and after it had been passed he instructed his\r\nrepresentatives at Rome to say that he had taken care to stop the\r\nmouth of Parliament and to have the question of annates referred to\r\nhis decision.[809] \"The King,\" writes the French envoy in England at\r\nthe end of March, \"has been very cunning, for he has caused the nobles\r\nand people to remit all to his will, so that the Pope may know that,\r\nif he does nothing for him, the King has the means of punishing\r\nhim.\"[810] The execution of the clauses providing for the          (p. 291)\r\nconfirmation and consecration of bishops without recourse to Rome was\r\nalso left at Henry's option.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 799: _L. and P._, v., 737.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 800: Henry had ordered Cromwell to have a\r\n                   bill with this object ready for the 1531 session\r\n                   (_L. and P._, v., 394), and another for the\r\n                   \"augmentation of treasons\"; apparently neither then\r\n                   proved acceptable to Parliament.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 801: _L. and P._, v., 805.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 802: _Ibid._, v., 989.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 803: _Ibid._, v., 1046.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 804: _Ibid._, v., 989.

Early in the session they were\r\ndiscussing the famous petition against the clergy, and, on 28th\r\nFebruary, Norfolk referred to the \"infinite clamours\" in Parliament\r\nagainst the Church.[811] The fact that four corrected drafts of this\r\npetition are extant in the Record Office, is taken as conclusive proof\r\nthat it really emanated from the Court.[812] But the drafts do not\r\nappear to be in the known hand of any of the Government clerks. The\r\ncorrections in Cromwell's hand doubtless represent the wishes of the\r\nKing; but, even were the whole in Cromwell's hand, it would be no bar\r\nto the hypothesis that Cromwell reduced to writing, for the King's\r\nconsideration, complaints which he heard from independent members in\r\nhis place in Parliament. The fact that nine-tenths of our modern\r\nlegislation is drawn up by Government draughtsmen, cannot be accepted\r\nas proof that that legislation represents no popular feeling. On the\r\nface of them, these petitions bear little evidence of Court dictation;\r\nthe grievances are not such as were felt by Henry, whose own demands\r\nof the clergy were laid directly before Convocation, without any   (p. 292)\r\npretence that they really came from the Commons. Some are similar\r\nto those presented to the Parliament of 1515; others are directed\r\nagainst abuses which recent statutes had sought, but failed, to\r\nremedy. Such were the citation of laymen out of their dioceses, the\r\nexcessive fees taken in spiritual courts, the delay and trouble in\r\nobtaining probates. Others complained that the clergy in Convocation\r\nmade laws inconsistent with the laws of the realm; that the ordinaries\r\ndelayed instituting parsons to their benefices; that benefices were\r\ngiven to minors; that the number of holy-days, especially in\r\nharvest-time, was excessive; and that spiritual men occupied temporal\r\noffices. The chief grievance seems to have been that the ordinaries\r\ncited poor men before the spiritual courts without any accuser being\r\nproduced, and then condemned them to abjure or be burnt. Henry,\r\nreported Chapuys, was \"in a most gracious manner\" promising to support\r\nthe Commons against the Church \"and to mitigate the rigours of the\r\ninquisition which they have here, and which is said to be more severe\r\nthan in Spain\".[813]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 811: _Ibid._, v., 831.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 812: _Ibid._, v., 1017-23. If the Court\r\n                   was responsible for all the documents complaining\r\n                   of the clergy drawn up at this time, it must have\r\n                   been very active. See others in _L. and P._, v.,\r\n                   49, App. 28, vi., 122.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 813: _L. and P._, v., 989.]\r\n\r\nAfter debating these points in Parliament, the Commons agreed that\r\n\"all the griefs, which the temporal men should be grieved with, should\r\nbe put in writing and delivered to the King\"; hence the drafts in the\r\nRecord Office. The deputation, with the Speaker at its head, presented\r\nthe complaints to Henry on 18th March. Its reception is quite\r\nunintelligible on the theory that the grievances existed only in the\r\nKing's imagination. Henry was willing, he said, to consider the\r\nCommons' petition. But, if they expected him to comply with their\r\nwishes, they must make some concession to his; and he recommended  (p. 293)\r\nthem to forgo their opposition to the bills of Uses and Wills, to\r\nwhich the Lords had already agreed. After Easter he sent the Commons'\r\npetition to Convocation; the clergy appealed to the King for\r\nprotection. Henry had thus manoeuvred himself into the position of\r\nmediator, in which he hoped, but in vain, to extract profit for\r\nhimself from both sides.[814] From Convocation he demanded submission\r\nto three important claims; the clergy were to consent to a reform of\r\necclesiastical law, to abdicate their right of independent legislation,\r\nand to recognise the necessity of the King's approval for existing\r\ncanons. These demands were granted. As usual, Henry was able to get\r\nwhat he wanted from the clergy; but from the Commons he could get no\r\nmore than they were willing to give. They again rejected the bills of\r\nUses and Wills, and would only concede the most paltry supplies. But\r\nthey passed with alacrity the bills embodying the submission of the\r\nclergy. These were the Church's concessions to Henry, but it must bend\r\nthe knee to the Commons as well, and other measures were passed\r\nreforming some of the points in their petition. Ordinaries were\r\nprohibited from citing men out of their proper dioceses, and benefit\r\nof clergy was denied to clerks under the order of sub-deacon who\r\ncommitted murder, felony, or petty treason; the latter was a slight\r\nextension of a statute passed in 1512. The bishops, however, led by\r\nGardiner and aided by More,[815] secured in the House of Lords     (p. 294)\r\nthe rejection of the concessions made by the Church to the King,\r\nthough they passed those made to the Commons. Parliament, which had\r\nsat for the unusual space of four months, was prorogued on the 14th of\r\nMay; two days later, More resigned the chancellorship and Gardiner\r\nretired in disfavour to Winchester.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 814: Stubbs, _Lectures_, 1887, pp.\r\n                   320-24; Hall, pp. 784, 785; see also _Lords'\r\n                   Journals_, 1532.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 815: _L. and P._, v., 1013. More had, as\r\n                   Henry knew, been all along opposed to the divorce,\r\n                   but as More gratefully acknowledged, the King only\r\n                   employed those whose consciences approved of the\r\n                   divorce on business connected with it (vii., 289).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the divorce case at Rome made little progress. In the\r\nhighest court in Christendom the facilities afforded for the law's\r\ndelays were naturally more extended than before inferior tribunals;\r\nand two years had been spent in discussing whether Henry's\r\n\"excusator,\" sent merely to maintain that the King of England could\r\nnot be cited to plead before the Papal Court, should be heard or not.\r\nClement was in suspense between two political forces. In December,\r\n1532, Charles was again to interview the Pope, and imperialists in\r\nItaly predicted that his presence would be as decisive in Catherine's\r\nfavour as it had been three years before. But Henry and Francis had,\r\nin October, exhibited to the world the closeness of their friendship\r\nby a personal interview at Boulogne.[816] No pomp or ceremony, like\r\nthat of the Field of Cloth of Gold, dazzled men's eyes; but the union\r\nbetween the two Kings was never more real. Neither Queen was present;\r\nHenry would not take Catherine, and he objected so strongly to Spanish\r\ndress that he could not endure the sight of Francis's Spanish\r\nQueen.[817] Anne Boleyn, recently created Marquis (so she was styled,\r\nto indicate the possession of the peerage in her own right) of     (p. 295)\r\nPembroke,[818] took Catherine's place; and plans for the promotion of\r\nthe divorce formed the staple of the royal discussions. Respect for\r\nthe power of the two Kings robbed the subsequent interview between\r\nEmperor and Pope of much of its effect; and before Charles and Clement\r\nparted, the Pope had secretly agreed to accord a similar favour to\r\nFrancis; he was to meet him at Nice in the following summer. Long\r\nbefore then the divorce had been brought to a crisis. By the end of\r\nJanuary Henry knew that Anne Boleyn was pregnant. Her issue must at\r\nany cost be made legitimate. That could only be done by Henry's\r\ndivorce from Catherine, and by his marriage with Anne Boleyn.[819]\r\nThere was little hope of obtaining these favours from Rome. Therefore\r\nit must be done by means of the Archbishop of Canterbury; and to\r\nremove all chance of disputing his sentence, the Court of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury must, before his decision was given, be\r\nrecognised as the supreme tribunal for English ecclesiastical cases.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 816: See P.A. Hamy, _Entrevue de Francois\r\n                   I. avec Henri VIII., a Boulogne en 1532_. Paris,\r\n                   1898.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 817: _L. and P._, v., 1187.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 818: _L. and P._, v., 1274.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 819: In 1529 Du Bellay had written _si le\r\n                   ventre croist, tout sera gaste_ (_L. and P._, iv.,\r\n                   5679).]\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, of which not a hint was suffered to transpire in\r\npublic, dictated Henry's policy during the early months of 1533. Never\r\nwas his skill more clearly displayed; he was, wrote Chapuys in\r\nDecember, 1532, practising more than ever with his Parliament,[820]\r\nthough he received the Spanish ambassador \"as courteously as\r\never\".[821] The difficulties with which he was surrounded might have\r\ntried the nerve of any man, but they only seemed to render Henry's\r\ncourse more daring and steady. The date of his marriage with Anne\r\nBoleyn is even now a matter of conjecture.[822] Cranmer repudiated (p. 296)\r\nthe report that he performed the ceremony.[823] He declares he did not\r\nknow of it until a fortnight after the event, and says it took place\r\nabout St. Paul's Day (25th January). A more important question was the\r\nindividuality of the archbishop who was to pronounce the nullity of\r\nHenry's marriage with Catherine of Aragon. He must obviously be one on\r\nwhom the King could rely. Fortunately for Henry, Archbishop Warham had\r\ndied in August, 1532. His successor was to be Thomas Cranmer, who had\r\nfirst suggested to Henry the plan of seeking the opinions of the\r\nuniversities on the divorce, and was now on an embassy at the\r\nEmperor's Court. No time was to be lost. Henry usually gathered a rich\r\nharvest during the vacancy of great bishoprics, but now Canterbury was\r\nto be filled up without any delay, and the King even lent Cranmer\r\n1,000 marks to meet his expenses.[824] But would the Pope be so\r\naccommodating as to expedite the bulls, suspecting, as he must have\r\ndone, the object for which they were wanted?\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 820: _L. and P._, v., 1633.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 821: _Ibid._, v., 1579.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 822: Cranmer, _Works_, ii., 246.

An appearance of\r\nfriendship with Clement was the weapon he now employed with the\r\ngreatest effect. The Pope was discussing with the French ambassadors a\r\nproposal to remit the divorce case to some neutral spot, such as\r\nCambrai, and delaying that definite sentence in Catherine's favour\r\nwhich imperialists had hoped that his interview with Charles would (p. 297)\r\nprecipitate;[825] the papal nuncio was being feasted in England,\r\nand was having suspiciously amicable conferences with members of\r\nHenry's council. Henry himself was writing to Clement in the most\r\ncordial terms; he had instructed his ambassadors in 1531 to \"use all\r\ngentleness towards him,\"[826] and Clement was saying that Henry was of\r\na better nature and more wise than Francis I.[827] Henry was now\r\nwilling to suspend his consent to the general council, where the Pope\r\nfeared that a scheme would be mooted for restoring the papal States to\r\nthe Emperor;[828] and he told the papal nuncio in England that, though\r\nhe had studied the question of the Pope's authority and retracted his\r\ndefence of the Holy See,[829] yet possibly Clement might give him\r\noccasion to probe the matter further still, and to reconfirm what he\r\nhad originally written.[830] Was he not, moreover, withholding his\r\nassent from the Act of Annates, which would deprive the Pope of large\r\nrevenues? Backed by this gentle hint, Henry's request not merely for\r\nCranmer's bulls, but for their expedition without the payment of the\r\nusual 10,000 marks, reached Rome. The cardinals were loth to forgo\r\ntheir perquisites for the bulls, but the annates of all England were\r\nmore precious still, and, on 22nd February, Consistory decided to do\r\nwhat Henry desired.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 825: _L. and P._, vi., 26. The interview\r\n                   took place at Bologna in December, 1532.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 826: _Ibid._, v., 326.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 827: _Ibid._, v., 555.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 828: _Ibid._, vi., 89, 212.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 829: _E.g._, _ibid._, v., 820, where Henry\r\n                   tells Tunstall that to follow the Pope is to\r\n                   forsake Christ, that it was no schism to separate\r\n                   from Rome, and that \"God willing, we shall never\r\n                   separate from the universal body of Christian men,\"\r\n                   and admits that he was misled in his youth to make\r\n                   war upon Louis XII. by those who sought only their\r\n                   own pomp, wealth and glory.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 830: _Ibid._, vi., 296.]\r\n\r\nThe same deceptive appearance of concord between King and Pope     (p. 298)\r\nwas employed to lull both Parliament and Convocation. The delays\r\nin the divorce suit disheartened Catherine's adherents. The Pope,\r\nwrote Chapuys, would lose his authority little by little, unless the\r\ncase were decided at once;[831] every one, he said, cried out \"au\r\nmurdre\" on Clement for his procrastination on the divorce, and for the\r\nspeed with which he granted Cranmer's bulls.[832] There was a general\r\nimpression that \"he would betray the Emperor,\" and \"many think that\r\nthere is a secret agreement between Henry and the Pope\".[833] That\r\nidea was sedulously fostered by Henry. Twice he took the Pope's nuncio\r\ndown in state to Parliament to advertise the excellent terms upon\r\nwhich he stood with the Holy See.[834] In the face of such evidence,\r\nwhat motive was there for prelates and others to reject the demands\r\nwhich Henry was pressing upon them? The Convocations of Canterbury and\r\nYork repeated the submission of 1532, and approved, by overwhelming\r\nmajorities, of two propositions: firstly, that, as a matter of law,\r\nthe Pope was not competent to dispense with the obstacle to a marriage\r\nbetween a man and his deceased brother's wife, when the previous\r\nmarriage had been consummated; and secondly, that, as a matter of\r\nfact, the marriage between Catherine and Prince Arthur had been so\r\nconsummated.[835] In Parliament, the Act forbidding Appeals to\r\nRome,[836] and providing for the confirmation and consecration of  (p. 299)\r\nbishops without recourse to the Papal Court, was discussed. It was,\r\nlike the rest of Henry's measures, based on a specious conservative\r\nplea. General councils had, the King said, decreed that suits should\r\nbe determined in the place in which they originated;[837] so there was\r\nno need for appeals to go out of England. Such opposition as it\r\nencountered was based on no religious principle. Commercial interests\r\nwere the most powerful impulse of the age, and the Commons were afraid\r\nthat the Act of Appeals might be followed by a papal interdict. They\r\ndid not mind the interdict as depriving them of religious consolations,\r\nbut they dreaded lest it might ruin their trade with the Netherlands.[838]\r\nHenry, however, persuaded them that the wool trade was as necessary to\r\nFlemings as it was to Englishmen, and that an interdict would prove no\r\nmore than an empty threat. He was careful to make no other demands\r\nupon the Commons. No subsidies were required; no extension of royal\r\nprerogative was sought; and eventually the Act of Appeals was passed\r\nwith a facility that seems to have created general surprise.[839]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 831: _L. and P._, vi., 142.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 832: _Ibid._, vi., 296.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 833: _Ibid._, vi., 89.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 834: _Ibid._, vi., 142, 160.

Cranmer was archbishop and _legatus natus_\r\nwith a title which none could dispute. By Act of Parliament his court\r\nwas the final resort for all ecclesiastical cases. No appeals from his\r\ndecision could be lawfully made. So, on 11th April, before he was yet\r\nconsecrated, he besought the King's gracious permission to determine\r\nhis \"great cause of matrimony, because much bruit exists among the\r\ncommon people on the subject\".[840] No doubt there did; but that   (p. 300)\r\nwas not the cause for the haste. Henry was pleased to accede to this\r\nrequest of the \"principal minister of our spiritual jurisdiction\";\r\nand, on the 10th of May, the Archbishop opened his Court at Dunstable.\r\nCatherine, of course, could recognise no authority in Cranmer to try a\r\ncause that was before the papal curia. She was declared contumacious,\r\nand, on the 23rd, the Archbishop gave his sentence. Following the line\r\nof Convocation, he pronounced that the Pope had no power to license\r\nmarriages such as Henry's, and that the King and Catherine had never\r\nbeen husband and wife.[841] Five days later, after a secret investigation,\r\nhe declared that Henry and Anne Boleyn were lawfully married, and on\r\nWhitsunday, the 1st of June, he crowned Anne as Queen in Westminster\r\nAbbey.[842] Three months later, on Sunday, the 7th of September,\r\nbetween three and four in the afternoon, Queen Anne gave birth to a\r\ndaughter at Greenwich.[843] The child was christened on the following\r\nWednesday by Stokesley, Bishop of London, and Cranmer stood godfather.\r\nChapuys scarcely considered the matter worth mention. The King's\r\n_amie_ had given birth to a bastard, a detail of little importance to\r\nany one, and least of all to a monarch like Charles V.[844]        (p. 301)\r\nYet the \"bastard\" was Queen Elizabeth, and the child, thus ushered\r\ninto a contemptuous world, lived to humble the pride of Spain, and to\r\nbear to a final triumph the banner which Henry had raised.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 840: Cranmer, _Works_, ii., 237.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 841: _Ibid._, ii., 241, 244; _L. and P._,\r\n                   vi., 332, 469, 470, 525. This sentence did not\r\n                   bastardise the Princess Mary according to Chapuys,\r\n                   for \"even if the marriage were null, the Princess\r\n                   was legitimate owing to the lawful ignorance of her\r\n                   parents. The Archbishop of Canterbury had foreseen\r\n                   this and had not dared to be so shameless as to\r\n                   declare her a bastard\" (_ibid._, vii., 94).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 842: See _Tudor Tracts_ edited by the\r\n                   present writer, 1903, pp. 10-28, and _L. and P._,\r\n                   vi., 561, 563, 584, 601.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 843: _L. and P._, vi., 1089, 1111.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 844: _L. and P._, vi., 1112.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.

Then the Tudor monarch seemed rushing headlong\r\nto irretrievable ruin. Sure of himself and his people, and feeling no\r\nlonger the need of Clement's favour, Henry threw off the mask of\r\nfriendship, and, on the 9th of July, confirmed, by letters patent, the\r\nAct of Annates.[845] Cranmer's proceedings at Dunstable, Henry's\r\nmarriage, and Anne's coronation, constituted a still more flagrant\r\ndefiance of Catholic Europe. The Pope's authority was challenged with\r\nevery parade of contempt. He could do no less than gather round him\r\nthe relics of his dignity and prepare to launch against Henry the\r\nfinal ban of the Church.[846] So, on the 11th of July, the sentence of\r\nthe greater excommunication was drawn up. Clement did not yet,     (p. 303)\r\nnor did he ever, venture to assert his claims to temporal supremacy in\r\nChristendom, by depriving the English King of his kingdom; he thought\r\nit prudent to rely on his own undisputed prerogative. His spiritual\r\npowers seemed ample; and he applied to himself the words addressed to\r\nthe Prophet Jeremiah, \"Behold, I have set thee above nations and\r\nkingdoms that thou mayest root up and destroy, build and plant, a lord\r\nover all kings of the whole earth and over all peoples bearing\r\nrule\".[847] In virtue of this prerogative Henry was cut off from the\r\nChurch while he lived, removed from the pale of Christian society, and\r\ndeprived of the solace of the rites of religion; when he died, he must\r\nlie without burial, and in hell suffer torment for ever.[848]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 845: _L. and P._, vi., 793.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 846: _Ibid._, vi., 807, App. 3; vii.,\r\n                   185. The declaration of it was at the same time\r\n                   suspended until September, and the delicate\r\n                   question of entrusting the _executoriales_ to\r\n                   princes who repudiated the honour caused further\r\n                   delays. The bull of excommunication was eventually\r\n                   dated 30th August, 1535 (ix., 207); and a bull\r\n                   depriving Henry of his kingdom was sanctioned,\r\n                   printed and prepared for publication (x., Introd.,\r\n                   p. xv., Nos. 82, 107), but first Francis and then\r\n                   Charles put difficulties in the way. In December,\r\n                   1538, Paul III., now that he, Charles and Francis\r\n                   were united in the bond of friendship, published\r\n                   with additions the bull of August, 1535 (XIII.,\r\n                   ii., 1087, Introd., p. xli.). Even then no bull of\r\n                   deprivation was published. Apparently that was an\r\n                   honour reserved for Henry's daughter.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 847: Jeremiah i. 10. The Vulgate text\r\n                   adopted in Papal bulls differs materially from that\r\n                   in the English Authorised Version.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 848: See the text in Burnet, ed. Pocock,\r\n                   iv., 318-31.]\r\n\r\nWhat would be the effect of this terrific anathema? The omens looked\r\nill for the English King. If he had flouted the Holy See, he had also\r\noffended the temporal head of Christendom. The Emperor's aunt had been\r\ndivorced, his cousin's legitimacy had been impugned, and the\r\ndespatches of his envoy, Chapuys, were filled with indignant\r\nlamentations over the treatment meted out to Catherine and to her\r\ndaughter. Both proud and stubborn women, they resolutely refused to\r\nadmit in any way the validity of Henry's acts and recent legislation.\r\nCatherine would rather starve as Queen, than be sumptuously clothed\r\nand fed as Princess Dowager. Henry would give her anything she asked,\r\nif she would acknowledge that she was not the Queen, nor her daughter\r\nthe Princess; but her bold resistance to his commands and wishes   (p. 304)\r\nbrought out all the worst features of his character.[849] His anger\r\nwas not the worst the Queen and her daughter had to fear; he still\r\npreserved a feeling of respect for Catherine and of affection for\r\nMary. \"The King himself,\" writes Chapuys, \"is not ill-natured; it is\r\nthis Anne who has put him in this perverse and wicked temper, and\r\nalienates him from his former humanity.\"[850] The new Queen's jealous\r\nmalignity passed all bounds. She caused her aunt to be made governess\r\nto Mary, and urged her to box her charge's ears; and she used every\r\neffort to force the Princess to serve as a maid upon her little\r\nhalf-sister, Elizabeth.[851]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 849: _L. and P._, vi., 805, 1186.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 850: _Ibid._, vi., 351; vii., 171, 871;\r\n                   _cf._ v., 216, where Chapuys says Anne hated the\r\n                   Princess Mary more than she did Queen Catherine\r\n                   because she saw that Henry had some affection for\r\n                   Mary, and praised her in Anne's presence. At the\r\n                   worst Henry's manners were generally polite; on one\r\n                   occasion, writes Chapuys, \"when the King was going\r\n                   to mount his horse, the Princess went on to a\r\n                   terrace at the top of the house to see him. The\r\n                   King, either being told of it or by chance, turned\r\n                   round, and seeing her on her knees with her hands\r\n                   joined, bowed to her and put his hand to his hat.\r\n                   Then all those present who had not dared to raise\r\n                   their heads to look at her [surely they may not\r\n                   have seen her] rejoiced at what the King had done,\r\n                   and saluted her reverently with signs of good-will\r\n                   and compassion\" (_ibid._, vii., 83).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 851: _Ibid._, vii., 171.]\r\n\r\nThis humiliation was deeply resented by the people, who, says Chapuys,\r\nthough forbidden, on pain of their lives, to call Catherine Queen,\r\nshouted it at the top of their voices.[852] \"You cannot imagine,\" he\r\nwrites a few weeks later to Charles, \"the great desire of all this\r\npeople that your Majesty should send men. Every day I have been\r\napplied to about it by Englishmen of rank, wit and learning,       (p. 305)\r\nwho give me to understand that the last King Richard was never so much\r\nhated by his people as this King.\"[853] The Emperor, he went on, had a\r\nbetter chance of success than Henry VII., and Ortiz at Rome was\r\ncherishing the belief that England would rise against the King for his\r\ncontumacy and schismatic disobedience.[854] Fisher was urgent that\r\nCharles should prepare an invasion of England; the young Marquis of\r\nExeter, a possible claimant to the throne, was giving the same\r\nadvice.[855] Abergavenny, Darcy and other peers brooded in sullen\r\ndiscontent. They were all listening to the hysterical ravings of\r\nElizabeth Barton,[856] the Nun of Kent, who prophesied that Henry had\r\nnot a year to live. Charles's emissaries were busy in Ireland, where\r\nKildare was about to revolt. James V. of Scotland was hinting at his\r\nclaims to the English crown, should Henry be deprived by the\r\nPope;[857] and Chapuys was divided in mind whether it would be better\r\nto make James the executor of the papal sentence, or marry Mary to\r\nsome great English noble, and raise an internal rebellion.[858] At\r\nCatherine's suggestion he recommended to the Emperor Reginald Pole, a\r\ngrandson of George, Duke of Clarence, as a suitor for Mary's hand; and\r\nhe urged, on his own account, Pole's claims to the English\r\nthrone.[859] Catherine's scruples, not about deposing her husband, or\r\npassing over the claims of Henry's sisters, but on the score of Edward\r\nIV.'s grandson, the Marquis of Exeter, might, thought Chapuys,     (p. 306)\r\nbe removed by appealing to the notorious sentence of Bishop Stillington,\r\nwho, on the demand of Richard III., had pronounced Edward IV.'s\r\nmarriage void and his children illegitimate.[860] Those who had been\r\nthe King's firm supporters when the divorce first came up were some of\r\nthem wavering, and others turning back.[861] Archbishop Lee, Bishops\r\nTunstall and Gardiner, and Bennet,[862] were now all in secret or open\r\nopposition, and even Longland was expressing to Chapuys regrets that\r\nhe had ever been Henry's confessor;[863] like other half-hearted\r\nrevolutionists, they would never have started at all, had they known\r\nhow far they would have to go, and now they were setting their sails\r\nfor an adverse breeze. It was the King, and the King alone, who kept\r\nEngland on the course which he had mapped out. Pope and Emperor were\r\ndefied; Europe was shocked; Francis himself disapproved of the breach\r\nwith the Church; Ireland was in revolt; Scotland, as ever, was\r\nhostile; legislation had been thrust down the throats of a\r\nrecalcitrant Church, and, we are asked to believe, of a no less\r\nunwilling House of Commons, while the people at large were seething\r\nwith indignation at the insults heaped upon the injured Queen and her\r\ndaughter. By all the laws of nature, of morals, and of politics, it\r\nwould seem, Henry was doomed to the fate of the monarch in the Book of\r\nDaniel the Prophet,[864] who did according to his will and exalted and\r\nmagnified himself above every god; who divided the land for gain, and\r\nhad power over the treasures of gold and silver; who was troubled by\r\ntidings from the east and from the north; who went forth with      (p. 307)\r\ngreat fury to destroy and utterly make away many, and yet came to\r\nhis end, and none helped him.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 852: _Ibid._, vi., 918.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 853: _L. and P._, vi., 508; vii., 121.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 854: _Ibid._, v., 1324.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 855: _Ibid._, v., 416.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 856: See _Transactions of the Royal Hist.\r\n                   Soc._, N.S., xviii.; _L. and P._, vi., 1419, 1445,\r\n                   1464, 1467, 1468.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 857: _L. and P._, v., 609, 807; vi., 815,\r\n                   821.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 858: _Ibid._, vi., 446, 541; vii., 114.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 859: _Ibid._, vi., 1164.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 860: _L. and P._, vii., 1368.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 861: Even Norfolk, and Suffolk and his\r\n                   wife wanted to dissuade Henry in 1531 from\r\n                   persisting in the divorce (_ibid._, v., 287).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 862: _Ibid._, v., 696.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 863: _Ibid._, vii., 14.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 864: Daniel xi., 36-45.]\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances, real and alleged, would be quite convincing\r\nas reasons for Henry's failure; but they are singularly inconclusive\r\nas explanations of his success, of the facts that his people did not\r\nrise and depose him, that no Spanish Armada disgorged its host on\r\nEnglish shores, and that, for all the papal thunderbolts, Henry died\r\nquietly in his bed fourteen years later, and was buried with a pomp\r\nand respect to which Popes themselves were little accustomed. He may\r\nhave stood alone in his confidence of success, and in his penetration\r\nthrough these appearances into the real truth of the situation behind.\r\nThat, from a purely political or non-moral point of view, is his chief\r\ntitle to greatness. He knew from the beginning what he could do; he\r\nhad counted the cost and calculated the risks; and, writes Russell in\r\nAugust, 1533, \"I never saw the King merrier than he is now\".[865] As\r\nearly as March, 1531, he told Chapuys that if the Pope issued 10,000\r\nexcommunications he would not care a straw for them.[866] When the\r\npapal nuncio first hinted at excommunication and a papal appeal to the\r\nsecular arm, Henry declared that he cared nothing for either.[867] He\r\nwould open the eyes of princes, he said, and show them how small was\r\nreally the power of the Pope;[868] and \"when the Pope had done what he\r\nliked on his side, Henry would do what he liked here\".[869] That\r\nthreat, at least, he fulfilled with a vengeance. He did not fear the\r\nSpaniards; they might come, he said (as they did in 1588), but     (p. 308)\r\nperhaps they might not return.[870] England, he told his subjects,\r\nwas not conquerable, so long as she remained united;[871] and the\r\npatriotic outburst with which Shakespeare closes \"King John\" is but an\r\necho and an expansion of the words of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n  This England never did, nor never shall,\r\n  Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,\r\n  But when it first did help to wound itself....\r\n  Come the three corners of the world in arms,\r\n  And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,\r\n  If England to itself do rest but true.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 865: _L. and P._, vi., 948.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 866: _Ibid._, v., 148.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 867: _Ibid._, v., 738.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 868: _Ibid._, v., 1292.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 869: _Ibid._, v., 287.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 870: _L. and P._, vi., 1479.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 871: _Ibid._, vi., 324.]\r\n\r\nThe great fear of Englishmen was lest Charles should ruin them by\r\nprohibiting the trade with Flanders. \"Their only comfort,\" wrote\r\nChapuys, \"is that the King persuades the people that it is not in your\r\nMajesty's power to do so.\"[872] Henry had put the matter to a\r\npractical test, in the autumn of 1533, by closing the Staple at\r\nCalais.[873] It is possible that the dispute between him and the\r\nmerchants, alleged as the cause for this step, was real; but the King\r\ncould have provided his subjects with no more forcible object-lesson.\r\nDistress was felt at once in Flanders; complaints grew so clamorous\r\nthat the Regent sent an embassy post-haste to Henry to remonstrate,\r\nand to represent the closing of the Staple as an infraction of\r\ncommercial treaties. Henry coldly replied that he had broken no\r\ntreaties at all; it was merely a private dispute between his merchants\r\nand himself, in which foreign powers had no ground for intervention.\r\nThe envoys had to return, convinced against their will. The Staple at\r\nCalais was soon reopened, but the English King was able to         (p. 309)\r\ndemonstrate to his people that the Flemings \"could not do without\r\nEngland's trade, considering the outcry they made when the Staple of\r\nCalais was closed for only three months\".\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 872: _Ibid._, vi., 1460.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 873: _Ibid._, vi., 1510, 1523, 1571.]\r\n\r\nHenry, indeed, might almost be credited with second-sight into the\r\nEmperor's mind. On 31st May, 1533, Charles's council discussed the\r\nsituation.[874] After considering Henry's enormities, the councillors\r\nproceeded to deliberate on the possible remedies. There were three:\r\njustice, force and a combination of both. The objections to relying on\r\nmethods of justice, that is, on the papal sentence, were, firstly,\r\nthat Henry would not obey, and secondly, that the Pope was not to be\r\ntrusted. The objections to the employment of force were, that war\r\nwould imperil the whole of Europe, and especially the Emperor's\r\ndominions, and that Henry had neither used violence towards Catherine\r\nnor given Charles any excuse for breaking the Treaty of Cambrai.\r\nEventually, it was decided to leave the matter to Clement. He was to\r\nbe urged to give sentence against Henry, but on no account to lay\r\nEngland under an interdict, as that \"would disturb her intercourse\r\nwith Spain and Flanders. If, therefore, an interdict be resorted to,\r\nit should be limited to one diocese, or to the place where Henry\r\ndwells.\"[875] Such an interdict might put a premium on assassination,\r\nbut otherwise neither Henry nor his people were likely to care much\r\nabout it. The Pope should, however, be exhorted to depose the English\r\nKing; that might pave the way for Mary's accession and for the\r\npredominance in England of the Emperor's influence; but the execution\r\nof the sentence must not be entrusted to Charles.[876] It would    (p. 310)\r\nbe excellent if James V. or the Irish would undertake to beard the\r\nlion in his den, but the Emperor did not see his way clear to\r\naccepting the risk himself.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 874: _L. and P._, vi., 568.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 875: _Ibid._, vi., 570.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 876: In January, 1534, Charles's\r\n                   ambassador at Rome repudiated the Pope's statement\r\n                   that the Emperor had ever offered to assist in the\r\n                   execution of the Pope's sentence (_L. and P._,\r\n                   vii., 96).]\r\n\r\nCharles was, indeed, afraid, not merely of Henry, but of Francis, who\r\nwas meditating fresh Italian schemes; and various expedients were\r\nsuggested to divert his attention in other directions. He might be\r\nassisted in an attack upon Calais. \"Calais,\" was Charles's cautious\r\ncomment, \"is better as it is, for the security of Flanders.\"[877] The\r\nPope hinted that the grant of Milan would win over Francis. It\r\nprobably would; but Charles would have abandoned half a dozen aunts\r\nrather than see Milan in French possession. His real concern in the\r\nmatter was not the injustice to Catherine, but the destruction of the\r\nprospect of Mary's succession. That was a tangible political interest,\r\nand Charles was much less anxious to have Henry censured than to have\r\nMary's legitimate claim to the throne established.[878] He was a great\r\npolitician, absolutely impervious to personal wrong when its remedy\r\nconflicted with political interests. \"Though the Emperor,\" he said,\r\n\"is bound to the Queen, this is a private matter, and public\r\nconsiderations must be taken into account.\" And public considerations,\r\nas he admitted a year later, \"compelled him to conciliate          (p. 311)\r\nHenry\".[879] So he refused Chapuys' request to be recalled lest his\r\npresence in England should lead people to believe that Charles had\r\ncondoned Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn,[880] and dissuaded\r\nCatherine from leaving England.[881] The least hint to Francis of any\r\nhostile intent towards Henry would, thought Charles, be at once\r\nrevealed to the English King, and the two would join in making war on\r\nhimself. War he was determined to avoid, for, apart from the ruin of\r\nFlanders, which it would involve, Henry and Francis had long been\r\nintriguing with the Lutherans in Germany. A breach might easily\r\nprecipitate civil strife in the Empire; and, indeed, in June, 1534,\r\nWuertemberg was wrested from the Habsburgs by Philip of Hesse with the\r\nconnivance of France. Francis, too, was always believed to have a\r\nworking agreement with the Turk; Barbarossa was giving no little cause\r\nfor alarm in the Mediterranean; while Henry on his part had established\r\nclose relations with Luebeck and Hamburg, and was fomenting dissensions\r\nin Denmark, the crown of which he was offered but cautiously       (p. 312)\r\ndeclined.[882]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 877: _Ibid._, vi., 774.

The English King was\r\ncareful to impress upon the French ambassador that he could, in the\r\nlast resort, make his peace with Charles by taking back Catherine and\r\nby restoring Mary to her place in the line of succession.[883] Francis\r\nhad too poignant a recollection of the results of the union between\r\nHenry and Charles from 1521 to 1525 ever to risk its renewal. The age\r\nof the crusades and chivalry was gone; commercial and national rivalries\r\nwere as potent in the sixteenth century as they are to-day. Then, as\r\nin subsequent times, mutual suspicions made impossible an effective\r\nconcert of Europe against the Turk. The fall of Rhodes and the death\r\nof one of Charles's brothers-in-law at Mohacz and the expulsion of\r\nanother from the throne of Denmark had never been avenged, and, in\r\n1534, the Emperor was compelled to evacuate Coron.[884] If Europe\r\ncould not combine against the common enemy of the Faith, was it likely\r\nto combine against one who, in spite of all his enormities, was still\r\nan orthodox Christian? And, without a combination of princes to\r\nexecute them, papal censures, excommunications, interdicts, and all\r\nthe spiritual paraphernalia, served only to probe the hollowness of\r\npapal pretensions, and to demonstrate the deafness of Europe to the\r\ncalls of religious enthusiasm. In Spain, at least, it might have been\r\nthought that every sword would leap from its scabbard at a summons (p. 313)\r\nfrom Charles on behalf of the Spanish Queen. \"Henry,\" wrote Chapuys,\r\n\"has always fortified himself by the consent of Parliament.\"[885] It\r\nwould be well, he thought, if Charles would follow suit, and induce\r\nthe Cortes of Aragon and Castile, \"or at least the grandees,\" to offer\r\ntheir persons and goods in Catherine's cause. Such an offer, if\r\npublished in England, \"will be of inestimable service\". But here comes\r\nthe proof of Charles's pitiful impotence; in order to obtain this\r\npublic offer, the Emperor was \"to give them privately an exemption\r\nfrom such offer and promise of persons and goods\". It was to be one\r\nmore pretence like the others, and unfortunately for the Pope and for\r\nthe Emperor, Henry had an inconvenient habit of piercing disguises.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 883: _L. and P._, vi., 1572.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 884: _Ibid._, vii., 670.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 885: _L. and P._, vi., 720.]\r\n\r\nThe strength of Henry's position at home was due to a similar lack of\r\nunity among his domestic enemies. If the English people had wished to\r\ndepose him, they could have effected their object without much\r\ndifficulty. In estimating the chances of a possible invasion, it was\r\npointed out how entirely dependent Henry was upon his people: he had\r\nonly one castle in London, and only a hundred yeomen of the guard to\r\ndefend him.[886] He would, in fact, have been powerless against a\r\nunited people or even against a partial revolt, if well organised and\r\nreally popular. There was chronic discontent throughout the Tudor\r\nperiod, but it was sectional. The remnants of the old nobility always\r\nhated Tudor methods of government, and the poorer commons were sullen\r\nat their ill-treatment by the lords of the land; but there was no\r\nconcerted basis of action between the two. The dominant class      (p. 314)\r\nwas commercial, and it had no grievance against Henry, while it feared\r\nalike the lords and the lower orders. In the spoliation of the Church\r\ntemporal lords and commercial men, both of whom could profit thereby,\r\nwere agreed; and nowhere was there much sympathy with the Church as an\r\ninstitution apart from its doctrine. Chapuys himself admits that the\r\nact, depriving the clergy of their profits from leases, was passed \"to\r\nplease the people\";[887] and another conservative declared that, if\r\nthe Church were deprived of all its temporal goods, many would be glad\r\nand few would bemoan.[888] Sympathy with Catherine and hatred of Anne\r\nwere general, but people thought, like Charles, that these were\r\nprivate griefs, and that public considerations must be taken into\r\naccount. Englishmen are at all times reluctant to turn out one\r\nGovernment until they see at least the possibility of another to take\r\nits place, and the only alternative to Henry VIII. was anarchy. The\r\nopposition could not agree on a policy, and they could not agree on a\r\nleader. There were various grandchildren of Edward IV. and of\r\nClarence, who might put forward distant claims to the throne; and\r\nthere were other candidates in whose multitude lay Henry's safety. It\r\nwas quite certain that the pushing of any one of these claimants would\r\nthrow the rest on Henry's side. James V., whom at one time Chapuys\r\nfavoured, knew that a Scots invasion would unite the whole of England\r\nagainst him; and Charles was probably wise in rebuking his\r\nambassador's zeal, and in thinking that any attempt on his own part\r\nwould be more disastrous to himself than to Henry.[889] For all    (p. 315)\r\nthis, the English King was, as Chapuys remarks, keeping a very\r\nwatchful eye on the countenance of his people,[890] seeing how far he\r\ncould go and where he must stop, and neglecting no precaution for the\r\npeace and security of himself and his kingdom. Acts were passed to\r\nstrengthen the navy, improvements in arms and armament were being\r\ncontinually tested, and the fortifications at Calais, on the Scots\r\nBorders and elsewhere were strengthened. Wales was reduced to law and\r\norder, and, through the intermediation of Francis, a satisfactory\r\npeace was made with Scotland.[891]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 886: _Ibid._, vi., App. 7.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 887: _L. and P._, vii., 114.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 888: _Ibid._, vii., 24.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 889: Chapuys is quite plaintive when he\r\n                   hints at the advantages which might follow if only\r\n                   \"your Majesty were ever so little angry\" with Henry\r\n                   VIII. (_L. and P._, vii., 114). A few days later he\r\n                   \"apologises for his previous letters advocating\r\n                   severity\" (_ibid._, vii., 171).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 890: _Ibid._, vi., 351.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 891: _Ibid._, vi., 729, 1161. One of\r\n                   Henry's baits to James V. was a suggestion that he\r\n                   would get Parliament to entail the succession on\r\n                   James if his issue by Anne Boleyn failed (_ibid._,\r\n                   vii., 114).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConvinced of his security from attack at home and abroad, Henry\r\nproceeded to accomplish what remained for the subjugation of the\r\nChurch in England and the final breach with Rome. Clement had no\r\nsooner excommunicated Henry than he began to repent; he was much more\r\nalarmed than the English King at the probable effects of his sentence.\r\nHenry at once recalled his ambassadors from Rome, and drew up an\r\nappeal to a General Council.[892] The Pope feared he would lose\r\nEngland for ever. Even the Imperialists proved but Job's comforters,\r\nand told him that, after all, it was only \"an unprofitable         (p. 316)\r\nisland,\"[893] the loss of which was not to be compared with the\r\nrenewed devotion of Spain and the Emperor's other dominions; possibly\r\nthey assured him that there would never again be a sack of Rome.\r\nClement delayed for a time the publication of the sentence against\r\nHenry, and in November he went to his interview with Francis I. at\r\nMarseilles.[894] While he was there, Bonner intimated to him Henry's\r\nappeal to a General Council. Clement angrily rejected the appeal as\r\nfrivolous, and Francis regarded this defiance of the Pope as an\r\naffront to himself in the person of his guest, and as the ruin of his\r\nattempts to reconcile the two parties. \"Ye have clearly marred all,\"\r\nhe said to Gardiner; \"as fast as I study to win the Pope, you study to\r\nlose him,\"[895] and he declared that, had he known of the intimation\r\nbeforehand, it should never have been made. Henry, however, had no\r\ndesire that the Pope should be won.[896] He was, he told the French\r\nambassador, determined to separate from Rome; \"he will not, in\r\nconsequence of this, be less Christian, but more so, for in everything\r\nand in every place he desires to cause Jesus Christ to be recognised,\r\nwho alone is the patron of Christians; and he will cause the Word to\r\nbe preached, and not the canons and decrees of the Pope.\"[897]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 892: _Ibid._, vi., 721, 979, 980, 998.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 893: _L. and P._, vi., 997.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 894: He is said, while there, to have\r\n                   privately admitted to Francis that the dispensation\r\n                   of Julius II. was invalid (_ibid._, vii., 1348,\r\n                   App. 8).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 895: _Ibid._, vi., 1425, 1426, 1427.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 896: On his side he was angry with\r\n                   Francis for telling the Pope that Henry would side\r\n                   against the Lutherans; he was afraid it might spoil\r\n                   his practices with them (_ibid._, vi., 614, 707);\r\n                   the Luebeckers had already suggested to Henry VIII.\r\n                   that he should seize the disputed throne of Denmark\r\n                   (_ibid._, vi., 428; _cf._ the present writer in\r\n                   _Cambridge Modern History_, ii., 229).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 897: _L. and P._, vi., 1435, 1479.]\r\n\r\nParliament was to meet to effect this purpose in January, 1534,    (p. 317)\r\nand during the previous autumn there are the first indications,\r\ntraceable to Cromwell's hand, of an attempt to pack it. He drew up a\r\nmemorandum of such seats as were vacant from death or from other\r\ncauses; most of the new members appear to have been freely elected,\r\nbut four vacancies were filled by \"the King's pleasure.\"[898] More\r\nextensive and less doubtful was the royal interference in the election\r\nof abbots. Many abbeys fell vacant in 1533, and in every case\r\ncommissioners were sent down to secure the election of the King's\r\nnominee; in many others, abbots were induced to resign, and fresh  (p. 318)\r\nones put in their place.[899] It is not clear that the main object was\r\nto pack the clerical representation in the House of Lords, because\r\nonly a few of these abbots had seats there, the abbots gave much less\r\ntrouble than the bishops in Parliament, and Convocation, where they\r\nlargely outnumbered the bishops, was much more amenable than the House\r\nof Peers, where the bishops' votes preponderated. It is more probable\r\nthat the end in view was already the dissolution of the monasteries by\r\nmeans of surrender. Cromwell, who was now said to \"rule everything,\"[900]\r\nwas boasting that he would make his King the richest monarch in\r\nChristendom, and his methods may be guessed from his praise of the\r\nSultan as a model to other princes for the authority he wielded over\r\nhis subjects.[901] Henry, however, was fortunate in 1533, even in the\r\nmatter of episcopal representation. He had, since the fall of Wolsey,\r\nhad occasion to fill up the Sees of York, Winchester, London, Durham\r\nand Canterbury; and in this year five more became vacant: Bangor, Ely,\r\nCoventry and Lichfield by death, and Salisbury and Worcester through\r\nthe deprivation by Act of Parliament of their foreign and absentee\r\npastors, Campeggio and Ghinucci.[902] Of the other bishops, Clerk of\r\nBath and Wells, and Longland of Lincoln, had been active in the\r\ndivorce, which, indeed, Longland, the King's confessor, was said to\r\nhave originally suggested about the year 1523; the Bishops of Norwich\r\nand of Chichester were both over ninety years of age.[903]         (p. 319)\r\nLlandaff was Catherine's confessor, a Spaniard who could not speak a\r\nword of English. On the whole bench there was no one but Fisher of\r\nRochester who had the will or the courage to make any effective stand\r\non behalf of the Church's liberty.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 898: _L. and P._, vi., 1382; vii., 56. A\r\n                   whole essay might be written on this latter brief\r\n                   document; it is not, what it purports to be, a list\r\n                   of knights of the shires who had died since the\r\n                   beginning of Parliament, for the names are those of\r\n                   living men. Against most of the constituencies two\r\n                   or three names are placed; Dr. Gairdner suggests\r\n                   that these are the possible candidates suggested by\r\n                   Cromwell and to be nominated by the King. But why\r\n                   is \"the King's pleasure\" placed opposite only three\r\n                   vacancies, if the whole twenty-eight were to be\r\n                   filled on his nomination? The names are probably\r\n                   those of influential magnates in the neighbourhood\r\n                   who would naturally have the chief voice in the\r\n                   election; and thus they would correspond with the\r\n                   vacancies, _e.g._, Hastings, opposite which is\r\n                   placed \"Not for the Warden of the Cinque Ports,\"\r\n                   and Southwark, for which there is a similar note\r\n                   for the Duke of Suffolk. It is obvious that the\r\n                   King could not fill up all the vacancies by\r\n                   nomination; for opposite Worcester town, where\r\n                   _both_ members, Dee and Brenning, had died, is\r\n                   noted, \"the King to name _one_\". It is curious to\r\n                   find \"the King's pleasure\" after Winchester city,\r\n                   as that was one of the constituencies for which\r\n                   Gardiner as bishop afterwards said he was wont to\r\n                   nominate burgesses (Foxe, ed. Townsend, vi., 54).\r\n                   It must also be remembered that these were\r\n                   bye-elections and possibly a novelty. In 1536 the\r\n                   rebels demand that \"if a knight or burgess died\r\n                   during Parliament his room should continue void to\r\n                   the end of the same\" (_L. and P._, xi., 1182\r\n                   [17]). In the seventeenth century\r\n                   supplementary members were chosen for the Long\r\n                   Parliament to fill possible vacancies; there were\r\n                   no bye-elections.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 899: _L. and P._, vi., 716, 816, 847,\r\n                   1007, 1056, 1057, 1109 (where by the Bishopric of\r\n                   \"Chester\" is meant Coventry and Lichfield, and not\r\n                   Chichester, as suggested by the editor; the See of\r\n                   Coventry and Lichfield was often called Chester\r\n                   before the creation of the latter see), 1239, 1304,\r\n                   1376, 1408, 1513; vii., 108, 257, 297, 344, 376.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 900: _Ibid._, vi., 1445.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 901: _Ibid._, vii., 1554.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 902: _Ibid._, vii., 48, 54, 634.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 903: _L. and P._, vii., 171.]\r\n\r\nBefore Parliament met Francis sent Du Bellay, Bishop of Paris, to\r\nLondon to make one last effort to keep the peace between England and\r\nRome. Du Bellay could get no concessions of any value from Henry. All\r\nthe King would promise was that, if Clement would before Easter\r\ndeclare his marriage with Catherine null and that with Anne valid, he\r\nwould not complete the extirpation of the papal authority.[904] Little\r\nenough of that remained, and Henry himself had probably no expectation\r\nand no wish that his terms should be accepted. Long before Du Bellay\r\nhad reached Rome, Parliament was discussing measures designed to\r\neffect the final severance. Opposition was of the feeblest character\r\nalike in Convocation and in both Houses of Parliament. Chapuys himself\r\ngloomily prophesied that there would be no difficulty in getting the\r\nprincipal measures, abolishing the Pope's authority and arranging for\r\nthe election of bishops, through the House of Lords.[905] The second\r\nAct of Appeals embodied the concessions made by Convocation in 1532\r\nand rejected that year in the House of Lords. Convocation was neither\r\nto meet nor to legislate without the King's assent; Henry might\r\nappoint a royal commission to reform the canon law;[906] appeals were\r\nto be permitted to Chancery from the Archbishop's Court;[907]      (p. 320)\r\nabbeys and other religious houses, which had been exempt from\r\nepiscopal authority, were placed immediately under the jurisdiction of\r\nChancery. A fresh Act of Annates defined more precisely the new method\r\nof electing bishops, and provided that, if the Chapter did not elect\r\nthe royal nominee within twelve days, the King might appoint him by\r\nletters patent. A third act forbade the payment of Peter-pence and\r\nother impositions to the Court of Rome, and handed over the business\r\nof dispensations and licences to the Archbishop of Canterbury; at the\r\nsame time it declared that neither King nor realm meant to vary from\r\nthe articles of the Catholic Faith of Christendom.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 904: _Ibid._, vii., App. 13.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 905: _Ibid._, vii., 171; _cf._ XII., ii.,\r\n                   952.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 906: This commission was not appointed\r\n                   till 1551: see the present writer's _Cranmer_, pp.\r\n                   280-4.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 907: 25 Henry VIII., c. 19. The first\r\n                   suggestion appears to have been \"to give the\r\n                   Archbishop of Canterbury the seal of Chancery, and\r\n                   pass bulls, dispensations and other provisions\r\n                   under it\" (_L. and P._, vii., 14; _cf._ vii., 57);\r\n                   his title was changed from _Apostolicae Sedis\r\n                   legatus_ to _Metropolitanus_ (_ibid._, vii.,\r\n                   1555).]\r\n\r\nAnother act provided that charges of heresy must be supported by two\r\nlay witnesses, and that indictments for that offence could only be made\r\nby lay authorities. This, like the rest of Henry's anti-ecclesiastical\r\nlegislation, was based on popular clamour. On the 5th of March the\r\nwhole House of Commons, with the Speaker at their head, had waited on\r\nthe King at York Place and expatiated for three hours on the\r\noppressiveness of clerical jurisdiction. At length it was agreed that\r\neight temporal peers, eight representatives of the Lower House and\r\nsixteen bishops \"should discuss the matter and the King be umpire\"[908]--a\r\nrepetition of the plan of 1529 and a very exact reflection of Henry's\r\nmethods and of the Church-and-State situation during the Reformation\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 908: _L. and P._, vii., 304, 393, 399;\r\n                   the provision about two witnesses was in 1547\r\n                   extended to treason.]\r\n\r\nThe final act of the session, which ended on 30th March, was a     (p. 321)\r\nconstitutional innovation of the utmost importance. From the earliest\r\nages the succession to the crown had in theory been determined, first\r\nby election, and then by hereditary right. In practice it had often\r\nbeen decided by the barbarous arbitrament of war. For right is vague,\r\nit may be disputed, and there was endless variety of opinion as to the\r\nproper claimant to the throne if Henry should die. So vague right was\r\nto be replaced by definite law, which could not be disputed, but\r\nwhich, unlike right, could easily be changed. The succession was no\r\nlonger to be regulated by an unalterable principle, but by the popular\r\n(or royal) will expressed in Acts of Parliament.[909] The first of a\r\nlong series of Acts of Succession was now passed to vest the succession\r\nto the crown in the heirs of the King by Anne Boleyn; clauses were\r\nadded declaring that persons who impugned that marriage by writing,\r\nprinting, or other deed were guilty of treason, and those who impugned\r\nit by words, of misprision. The Government proposal that both classes\r\nof offenders should be held guilty of treason was modified by the\r\nHouse of Commons.[910]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 909: The succession to the crown was one\r\n                   of the last matters affected by the process of\r\n                   substituting written law for unwritten right which\r\n                   began with the laws of Ethelbert of Kent. There had\r\n                   of course been _ex post facto_ acts recognising\r\n                   that the crown was vested in the successful\r\n                   competitor.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 910: _L. and P._, vii., 51.]\r\n\r\nOn 23rd March, a week before the prorogation of Parliament, and seven\r\nyears after the divorce case had first begun, Clement gave sentence at\r\nRome pronouncing valid the marriage between Catherine and Henry.[911]\r\nThe decision produced not a ripple on the surface of English affairs;\r\nHenry, writes Chapuys, took no account of it and was making as     (p. 322)\r\ngood cheer as ever.[912] There was no reason why he should not.\r\nWhile the imperialist mob at Rome after its kind paraded the streets\r\nin crowds, shouting \"Imperio et Espagne,\" and firing _feux-de-joie_\r\nover the news, the imperialist agent was writing to Charles that the\r\njudgment would not be of much profit, except for the Emperor's honour\r\nand the Queen's justification, and was congratulating his master that\r\nhe was not bound to execute the sentence.[913] Flemings were tearing\r\ndown the papal censures from the doors of their churches,[914] and\r\nCharles was as convinced as ever of the necessity of Henry's\r\nfriendship. He proposed to the Pope that some one should be sent from\r\nRome to join Chapuys in \"trying to move the King from his error\"; and\r\nClement could only reply that \"he thought the embassy would have no\r\neffect on the King, but that nothing would be lost by it, and it would\r\nbe a good compliment!\"[915] Henry, however was less likely to be\r\ninfluenced by compliments, good or bad, than by the circumstance that\r\nneither Pope nor Emperor was in a position to employ any ruder\r\npersuasive. There was none so poor as to reverence a Pope, and, when\r\nClement died six months later, the Roman populace broke into the\r\nchamber where he lay and stabbed his corpse; they were with difficulty\r\nprevented from dragging it in degradation through the streets.[916]\r\nSuch was the respect paid to the Supreme Pontiff in the Holy City, and\r\ndeference to his sentence was not to be expected in more distant\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 911: _Ibid._, vii., 362.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 912: _L. and P._, vii., 469.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 913: _Ibid._, vii., 368.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 914: _Ibid._, vii., 184.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 915: _Ibid._, vii., 804.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 916: _Ibid._, vii., 1262.]\r\n\r\nHenry's political education was now complete; the events of the last\r\nfive years had proved to him the truth of the assertion, with      (p. 323)\r\nwhich he had started, that the Pope might do what he liked at Rome,\r\nbut that he also could do what he liked in England, so long as he\r\navoided the active hostility of the majority of his lay subjects. The\r\nChurch had, by its actions, shown him that it was powerless; the Pope\r\nhad proved the impotence of his spiritual weapons; and the Emperor had\r\nadmitted that he was both unable and unwilling to interfere. Henry had\r\nrealised the extent of his power, and the opening of his eyes had an\r\nevil effect upon his character. Nothing makes men or Governments so\r\ncareless or so arbitrary as the knowledge that there will be no\r\neffective opposition to their desires. Henry, at least, never grew\r\ncareless; his watchful eye was always wide open. His ear was always\r\nstrained to catch the faintest rumbling of a coming storm, and his\r\nsubtle intellect was ever on the alert to take advantage of every turn\r\nin the diplomatic game. He was always efficient, and he took good care\r\nthat his ministers should be so as well. But he grew very arbitrary;\r\nthe knowledge that he could do so much became with him an irresistible\r\nreason for doing it. Despotic power is twice cursed; it debases the\r\nruler and degrades the subject; and Henry's progress to despotism may\r\nbe connected with the rise of Thomas Cromwell, who looked to the Great\r\nTurk as a model for Christian princes.[917] Cromwell became secretary\r\nin May, 1534; in that month Henry's security was enhanced by the   (p. 324)\r\ndefinitive peace with Scotland,[918] and he set to work to enforce\r\nhis authority with the weapons which Parliament had placed in his\r\nhands. Elizabeth Barton, and her accomplices, two Friars Observants,\r\ntwo monks, and one secular priest, all attainted of treason by Act of\r\nParliament, were sent to the block.[919] Commissioners were sent\r\nround, as Parliament had ordained, to enforce the oath of succession\r\nthroughout the land.[920] A general refusal would have stopped Henry's\r\ncareer, but the general consent left Henry free to deal as he liked\r\nwith the exceptions. Fisher and More were sent to the Tower. They were\r\nwilling to swear to the succession, regarding that as a matter within\r\nthe competence of Parliament, but they refused to take the oath\r\nrequired by the commissioners;[921] it contained, they alleged, a\r\nrepudiation of the Pope not justified by the terms of the statute. Two\r\ncartloads of friars followed them to the Tower in June, and the Order\r\nof Observants, in whose church at Greenwich Henry had been baptised\r\nand married, and of whom in his earlier years he had written in terms\r\nof warm admiration, was suppressed altogether.[922]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 917: \"The Lord Cromwell,\" says Bishop\r\n                   Gardiner, \"had once put in the King our late\r\n                   sovereign lord's head, to take upon him to have his\r\n                   will and pleasure regarded for a law; for that, he\r\n                   said, was to be a very King,\" and he quoted the\r\n                   _quod principi placuit_ of Roman civil law.\r\n                   Gardiner replied to the King that \"to make the laws\r\n                   his will was more sure and quiet\" and \"agreeable\r\n                   with the nature of your people\". Henry preferred\r\n                   Gardiner's advice (Foxe, ed. Townsend, vi., 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 918: _L. and P._, vii., 483, 647.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 919: _Ibid._, vii., 522.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 920: _Ibid._, vii., 665.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 921: _Ibid._, vii., 499.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 922: _Ibid._, vii., 841, 856. The order\r\n                   had been particularly active in opposition to the\r\n                   divorce (_ibid._, iv., 6156; v., 266.)]\r\n\r\nIn November Parliament[923] reinforced the Act of Succession by laying\r\ndown the precise terms of the oath, and providing that a certificate\r\nof refusal signed by two commissioners was as effective as the\r\nindictment of twelve jurors. Other acts empowered the King to repeal\r\nby royal proclamation certain statutes regulating imports and exports.\r\nThe first-fruits and tenths, of which the Pope had been already    (p. 325)\r\ndeprived, were now conferred on the King as a fitting ecclesiastical\r\nendowment for the Supreme Head of the Church. That title, granted him\r\nfour years before by both Convocations, was confirmed by Act of\r\nParliament; its object was to enable the King as Supreme Head to\r\neffect the \"increase of virtue in Christ's Religion within this Realm\r\nof England, and to repress and extirp all Errors, Heresies and other\r\nEnormities, and Abuses heretofore used in the same\". The Defender of\r\nthe Faith was to be armed with more than a delegate power; he was to\r\nbe supreme in himself, the champion not of the Faith of any one else,\r\nbut of his own; and the qualifying clause, \"as far as the law of\r\nChrist allows,\" was omitted. His orthodoxy must be above suspicion, or\r\nat least beyond the reach of open cavil in England. So new treasons\r\nwere enacted, and any one who called the King a heretic, schismatic,\r\ntyrant, infidel, or usurper, was rendered liable to the heaviest\r\npenalty which the law could inflict. As an earnest of the royal and\r\nparliamentary desire for an increase of virtue in religion, an act was\r\nconcurrently passed providing for the creation of a number of\r\nsuffragan bishops.[924]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 923: _Ibid._, vii., 1377.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 924: These were not actually created till\r\n                   1540; the way in which Henry VIII. sought statutory\r\n                   authority for every conceivable thing is very\r\n                   extraordinary. There seems no reason why he could\r\n                   not have created these bishoprics without\r\n                   parliamentary authority.]\r\n\r\nHenry was now Pope in England with powers no Pope had possessed.[925]\r\nThe Reformation is variously regarded as the liberation of the     (p. 326)\r\nEnglish Church from the Roman yoke it had long impatiently borne,\r\nas its subjection to an Erastian yoke which it was henceforth, with\r\nmore or less patience, long to bear, or as a comparatively unimportant\r\nassertion of a supremacy which Kings of England had always enjoyed.\r\nThe Church is the same Church, we are told, before and after the\r\nchange; if anything, it was Protestant before the Reformation, and\r\nCatholic after. It is, of course, the same Church. A man may be\r\ndescribed as the same man before and after death, and the business of\r\na coroner's jury is to establish the identity; but it does not ignore\r\nthe vital difference. Even Saul and Paul were the same man. And the\r\nidentity of the Church before and after the legislation of Henry VIII.\r\ncovers a considerable number of not unimportant changes. It does not,\r\nhowever, seem strictly accurate to say that Henry either liberated or\r\nenslaved the Church. Rather, he substituted one form of despotism for\r\nanother, a sole for a dual control; the change, complained a reformer,\r\nwas merely a _translatio imperii_.[926] The democratic movement within\r\nthe Church had died away, like the democratic movements in national\r\nand municipal politics, before the end of the fifteenth century. It\r\nwas never merry with the Church,[927] complained a Catholic in 1533,\r\nsince the time when bishops were wont to be chosen by the Holy Ghost\r\nand by their Chapters.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 925: With limitations, of course. Henry's\r\n                   was only a _potestas jurisdictionis_ not a\r\n                   _potestas ordinis_ (see Makower, _Const. Hist. of\r\n                   the Church of England_, and the present writer's\r\n                   _Cranmer_, pp. 83, 84, 95, 232, 233). Cranmer\r\n                   acknowledged in the King also a _potestatem\r\n                   ordinis_, just as Cromwell would have made him the\r\n                   sole legislator in temporal affairs; Henry's\r\n                   unrivalled capacity for judging what he could and\r\n                   could not do saved him from adopting either\r\n                   suggestion.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 926: _L. and P._, XIV., ii., p. 141.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 927: _Ibid._, vi., 797 [2];\r\n                   a Venetian declared that Huguenotism was\r\n                   \"due to the abolition of the election of the\r\n                   clergy\" (Armstrong, _Wars of Religion_, p. 11).]\r\n\r\nSince then the Church had been governed by a partnership between King\r\nand Pope, without much regard for the votes of the shareholders. It\r\nwas not Henry who first deprived them of influence; neither did    (p. 327)\r\nhe restore it. What he did was to eject his foreign partner,\r\nappropriate his share of the profits, and put his part of the business\r\ninto the hands of a manager. First-fruits and tenths were described as\r\nan intolerable burden; but they were not abolished; they were merely\r\ntransferred from the Pope to the King. Bishops became royal nominees,\r\npure and simple, instead of the joint nominees of King and Pope. The\r\nsupreme appellate jurisdiction in ecclesiastical causes was taken away\r\nfrom Rome, but it was not granted the English Church to which in truth\r\nit had never belonged.[928] Chancery, and not the Archbishop's Court,\r\nwas made the final resort for ecclesiastical appeals. The authority,\r\ndivided erstwhile between two, was concentrated in the hands of one;\r\nand that one was thus placed in a far different position from that\r\nwhich either had held before.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 928: For one year, indeed, Cranmer\r\n                   remained _legatus natus_, and by a strange anomaly\r\n                   exercised a jurisdiction the source of which had\r\n                   been cut off. Stokesley objected to Cranmer's use\r\n                   of that style in order to escape a visitation of\r\n                   his see, and Gardiner thought it an infringement of\r\n                   the royal prerogative. It was abolished in the\r\n                   following year.]\r\n\r\nThe change was analogous to that in Republican Rome from two consuls\r\nto one dictator. In both cases the dictatorship was due to exceptional\r\ncircumstances. There had long been a demand for reform in the Church\r\nin England as well as elsewhere, but the Church was powerless to\r\nreform itself. The dual control was in effect, as dual controls often\r\nare, a practical anarchy. The condition of the Church before the\r\nReformation may be compared with that of France before the Revolution.\r\nIn purely spiritual matters the Pope was supreme: the conciliar\r\nmovement of the fifteenth century had failed. The Pope had         (p. 328)\r\ngathered all powers to himself, in much the same way as the French\r\nmonarch in the eighteenth century had done; and the result was the\r\nsame, a formal despotism and a real anarchy. Pope and Monarch were\r\ncrushed by the weight of their own authority; they could not reform,\r\neven when they wanted to. From 1500 to 1530 almost every scheme,\r\npeaceful or bellicose, started in Europe was based on the plea that\r\nits ultimate aim was the reform of the Church; and so it would have\r\ncontinued, _vox et praeterea nihil_, had not the Church been galvanised\r\ninto action by the loss of half its inheritance.\r\n\r\nIn England the change from a dual to a sole control at once made that\r\ncontrol effective, and reform became possible. But it was a reform\r\nimposed on the Church from without and by means of the exceptional\r\npowers bestowed on the Supreme Head. Hence the burden of modern\r\nclerical criticism of the Reformation. Objection is raised not so much\r\nto the things that were done, as to the means by which they were\r\nbrought to pass, to the fact that the Church was forcibly reformed by\r\nthe State, and not freed from the trammels of Rome, and then left to\r\nwork out its own salvation. But such a solution occurred to few at\r\nthat time; the best and the worst of Henry's opponents opposed him on\r\nthe ground that he was divorcing the Church in England from the Church\r\nuniversal. Their objection was to what was done more than to the way\r\nin which it was done; and Sir Thomas More would have fought the\r\nReformation quite as strenuously had it been effected by the\r\nConvocations of Canterbury and York. On the other side there was\r\nequally little thought of a Reformation by clerical hands. Henry   (p. 329)\r\nand Cromwell carried on and developed the tradition of the Emperor\r\nFrederick II. and Peter de Vinea,[929] of Philippe le Bel and\r\nPierre Dubois, of Lewis the Bavarian and Marsiglio of Padua[930] who\r\nmaintained the supremacy of the temporal over the spiritual power and\r\nasserted that the clergy wielded no jurisdiction and only bore the\r\nkeys of heaven in the capacity of turnkeys.[931] It was a question of\r\nthe national State against the universal Church. The idea of a\r\nNational Church was a later development, the result and not the cause\r\nof the Reformation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 929: The comparison has been drawn by\r\n                   Huillard-Breholles in his _Vie et Correspondence de\r\n                   Pierre de la Vigne_, Paris, 1865.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 930: Marsiglio's _Defensor Pacis_ was a\r\n                   favourite book with Cromwell who lent a printer L20\r\n                   to bring out an English edition of it in 1535 (see\r\n                   the present writer in _D.N.B., s.v._ Marshall,\r\n                   William). Marshall distributed twenty-four copies\r\n                   among the monks of Charterhouse to show them how\r\n                   the Christian commonwealth had been \"unjustly\r\n                   molested, vexed and troubled by the spiritual and\r\n                   ecclesiastical tyrant\". See also Maitland, _English\r\n                   Law and the Renaissance_, pp. 14, 60, 61.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 931: _Defensor Pacis_, ii., 6.]\r\n\r\nHenry's dictatorship was also temporary in character. His supremacy\r\nover the Church was royal, and not parliamentary. It was he, and not\r\nParliament, who had been invested with a semi-ecclesiastical nature.\r\nIn one capacity he was head of the State, in another, head of the\r\nChurch. Parliament and Convocation were co-ordinate one with another,\r\nand subordinate both to the King. The Tudors, and especially Elizabeth,\r\nvehemently denied to their Parliaments any share in their ecclesiastical\r\npowers. Their supremacy over the Church was their own, and, as a\r\nreally effective control, it died with them. As the authority of the\r\nCrown declined, its secular powers were seized by Parliament;      (p. 330)\r\nits ecclesiastical powers fell into abeyance between Parliament and\r\nConvocation. Neither has been able to vindicate an exclusive claim to\r\nthe inheritance; and the result of this dual claim to control has been\r\na state of helplessness, similar in some respects to that from which\r\nthe Church was rescued by the violent methods of Henry VIII.[932]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 932: A much neglected but very important\r\n                   constitutional question is whether the King _qua_\r\n                   Supreme Head of the Church was limited by the same\r\n                   statute and common law restrictions as he was _qua_\r\n                   temporal sovereign. Gardiner raised the question in\r\n                   a most interesting letter to Protector Somerset in\r\n                   1547 (Foxe, vi., 42). It had been provided, as Lord\r\n                   Chancellor Audley told Gardiner, that no spiritual\r\n                   law and no exercise of the royal supremacy should\r\n                   abate the common law or Acts of Parliament; but\r\n                   within the ecclesiastical sphere there were no\r\n                   limits on the King's authority. The Popes had not\r\n                   been fettered, _habent omnia jura in suo scrinio_;\r\n                   and their jurisdiction in England had been\r\n                   transferred whole and entire to the King. Henry was\r\n                   in fact an absolute monarch in the Church, a\r\n                   constitutional monarch in the State; he could\r\n                   reform the Church by injunction when he could not\r\n                   reform the State by proclamation. There was\r\n                   naturally a tendency to confuse the two capacities\r\n                   not merely in the King's mind but in his\r\n                   opponents'; and some of the objections to the\r\n                   Stuarts' dispensing practice, which was exercised\r\n                   chiefly in the ecclesiastical sphere, seem due to\r\n                   this confusion. Parliament in fact, as soon as the\r\n                   Tudors were gone, began to apply common law and\r\n                   statute law limitations to the Crown's\r\n                   ecclesiastical prerogative.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.                                                      (p. 331)\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry's title as Supreme Head of the Church was incorporated in the\r\nroyal style by letters patent of 15th January, 1535,[933] and that\r\nyear was mainly employed in compelling its recognition by all sorts\r\nand conditions of men. In April, Houghton, the Prior of the Charterhouse,\r\na monk of Sion, and the Vicar of Isleworth, were the first victims\r\noffered to the Supreme Head. But the machinery supplied by Parliament\r\nwas barely sufficient to bring the penalties of the statute to bear on\r\nthe two most illustrious of Henry's opponents, Fisher and More. Both\r\nhad been attainted of misprision of treason by Acts of Parliament in\r\nthe previous autumn; but those penalties extended no further than to\r\nlifelong imprisonment and forfeiture of goods. Their lives could only\r\nbe exacted by proving that they had maliciously attempted to deprive\r\nHenry of his title of Supreme Head;[934] their opportunities in the\r\nTower for compassing that end were limited; and it is possible     (p. 332)\r\nthat they would not have been further molested, but for the\r\nthoughtlessness of Clement's successor, Paul III. Impotent to effect\r\nanything against the King, the Pope did his best to sting Henry to\r\nfury by creating Fisher a cardinal on 20th May. He afterwards\r\nexplained that he meant no harm, but the harm was done, and it\r\ninvolved Fisher's friend and ally, Sir Thomas More. Henry declared\r\nthat he would send the new cardinal's head to Rome for the hat; and he\r\nimmediately despatched commissioners to the Tower to inform Fisher and\r\nMore that, unless they acknowledged the royal supremacy, they would be\r\nput to death as traitors.[935] Fisher apparently denied the King's\r\nsupremacy, More refused to answer; he was, however, entrapped during a\r\nconversation with the Solicitor-General, Rich, into an admission that\r\nEnglishmen could not be bound to acknowledge a supremacy over the\r\nChurch in which other countries did not concur. In neither case was it\r\nclear that they came within the clutches of the law. Fisher, indeed,\r\nhad really been guilty of treason. More than once he had urged Chapuys\r\nto press upon Charles the invasion of England, a fact unknown,\r\nperhaps, to the English Government.[936] The evidence it had       (p. 333)\r\ncollected was, however, considered sufficient by the juries which\r\ntried the prisoners; Fisher went to the scaffold on 22nd June, and\r\nMore on 6th July. Condemned justly or not by the law, both sought\r\ntheir death in a quarrel which is as old as the hills and will last\r\ntill the crack of doom. Where shall we place the limits of conscience,\r\nand where those of the national will? Is conscience a luxury which\r\nonly a king may enjoy in peace? Fisher and More refused to accommodate\r\ntheirs to Acts of Parliament, but neither believed conscience to be\r\nthe supreme tribunal.[937] More admitted that in temporal matters his\r\nconscience was bound by the laws of England; in spiritual matters the\r\nconscience of all was bound by the will of Christendom; and on that\r\nground both Fisher and he rejected the plea of conscience when urged\r\nby heretics condemned to the flames. The dispute, indeed, passes the\r\nwit of man to decide. If conscience must reign supreme, all government\r\nis a _pis aller_, and in anarchy the true millennium must be found. If\r\nconscience is deposed, man sinks to the level of the lower creation.\r\nHuman society can only be based on compromise, and compromise itself\r\nis a matter of conscience. Fisher and More protested by their death\r\nagainst a principle which they had practised in life; both they and\r\nthe heretics whom they persecuted proclaimed, as Antigone had done\r\nthousands of years before,[938] that they could not obey laws      (p. 334)\r\nwhich they could not believe God had made.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 933: _L. and P._, viii., 52; Rymer, xiv.,\r\n                   549.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 934: The general idea that Fisher and\r\n                   More were executed for refusing to take an oath\r\n                   prescribed in the Act of Supremacy is technically\r\n                   inaccurate.

For the first\r\nand last time in English history a cardinal's head had rolled from an\r\nEnglish scaffold; and Paul III. made an effort to bring into play the\r\nartillery of his temporal powers. As supreme lord over all the princes\r\nof the earth, he arrogated to himself the right to deprive Henry VIII.\r\nof his kingdom; and he sent couriers to the various courts to seek\r\ntheir co-operation in executing his judgment. But the weapons of\r\nInnocent III. were rusty with age. Francis denounced the Pope's claim\r\nas a most impudent attack on monarchical dignity; and Charles was\r\nengaged in the conquest of Tunis. Thus Henry was able to take a high\r\ntone in reply to the remonstrances addressed to him, and to proceed\r\nundisturbed with the work of enforcing his royal supremacy. The autumn\r\nwas occupied mainly by a visitation of the monasteries and of the\r\nuniversities of Oxford and Cambridge; the schoolmen, Thomas Aquinas,\r\nDuns Scotus and others were deposed from the seat of authority they\r\nhad held for so many centuries, and efforts were made to substitute\r\nstudies like that of the civil law, more in harmony with the King's\r\ndoctrine and with his views of royal authority.\r\n\r\nThe more boldly Henry defied the Fates, the more he was favoured by\r\nFortune. \"Besides his trust in his subjects,\" wrote Chapuys in     (p. 335)\r\n1534, \"he has great hope in the Queen's death;\"[939] and the year\r\n1536 was but eight days old when the unhappy Catherine was released\r\nfrom her trials, resolutely refusing to the last to acknowledge in any\r\nway the invalidity of her marriage with Henry. She had derived some\r\ncomfort from the papal sentence in her favour, but that was not\r\ncalculated to soften the harshness with which she was treated. Her\r\npious soul, too, was troubled with the thought that she had been the\r\noccasion, innocent though she was, of the heresies that had arisen in\r\nEngland, and of the enormities which had been practised against the\r\nChurch. Her last days were cheered by a visit from Chapuys,[940] who\r\nwent down to Kimbolton on New Year's Day and stayed until the 5th of\r\nJanuary, when the Queen seemed well on the road to recovery. Three\r\ndays later she passed away, and on the 29th she was buried with the\r\nstate of a princess dowager in the church of the Benedictine abbey at\r\nPeterborough. Her physician told Chapuys that he suspected poison, but\r\nthe symptoms are now declared, on high medical authority, to have been\r\nthose of cancer of the heart.[941] The suspicion was the natural\r\nresult of the circumstance that her death relieved the King of a\r\npressing anxiety. \"God be praised!\" he exclaimed, \"we are free from\r\nall suspicion of war;\"[942] and on the following day he proclaimed his\r\njoy by appearing at a ball, clad in yellow from head to foot.[943] Every\r\ninch a King, Henry VIII. never attained to the stature of a gentleman,\r\nbut even Bishop Gardiner wrote that by Queen Catherine's death     (p. 336)\r\n\"God had given sentence\" in the divorce suit between her and the King.[944]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 939: _L. and P._, vii., 83.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 940: _Ibid._, x., 28, 59, 60, 141.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 941: Dr. Norman Moore in _Athenaeum_,\r\n                   1885, i., 152, 215, 281.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 942: _L. and P._, x., 51.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 943: _Ibid._ Hall only tells his readers\r\n                   that Anne Boleyn wore yellow for the mourning\r\n                   (_Chronicle_, p. 818).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 944: _L. and P._, x., 256.]\r\n\r\nA week later, the Reformation Parliament met for its seventh and last\r\nsession. It sat from 4th February to 14th April, and in those ten\r\nweeks succeeded in passing no fewer than sixty-two Acts. Some were\r\nlocal and some were private, but the residue contained not a few of\r\npublic importance. The fact that the King obtained at last his Statute\r\nof Uses[945] may indicate that Henry's skill and success had so\r\nimpressed Parliament, that it was more willing to acquiesce in his\r\ndemands than it had been in its earlier sessions. But, if the drafts\r\nin the Record Office are to be taken as indicating the proposals of\r\nGovernment, and the Acts themselves are those proposals as modified in\r\none or other House, Parliament must have been able to enforce views of\r\nits own to a certain extent; for those drafts differ materially from\r\nthe Acts as finally passed.[946] Not a few of the bills were welcome,\r\nif unusual, concessions to the clergy. They were relieved from paying\r\ntenths in the year they paid their first-fruits. The payment of\r\ntithes, possibly rendered doubtful in the wreck of canon law, was\r\nenjoined by Act of Parliament. An attempt was made to deal with the\r\npoor, and another, if not to check enclosures, at least to extract\r\nsome profit for the King from the process. It was made high treason to\r\ncounterfeit the King's sign-manual, privy signet, or privy seal; and\r\nHenry was empowered by Parliament, as he had before been by        (p. 337)\r\nConvocation, to appoint a commission to reform the canon law. But the\r\nchief acts of the session were for the dissolution of the lesser\r\nmonasteries and for the erection of a Court of Augmentations in order\r\nto deal with the revenues which were thus to accrue to the King.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 945: This Act has generally been\r\n                   considered a failure, but recent research does not\r\n                   confirm this view (see Joshua Williams, _Principles\r\n                   of the Law of Real Property_, 18th ed., 1896).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 946: _L. and P._, x., 246.]\r\n\r\nThe way for this great revolution had been carefully prepared during\r\nthe previous autumn and winter. In virtue of his new and effective\r\nsupremacy, Henry had ordered a general visitation of the monasteries\r\nthroughout the greater part of the kingdom; and the reports of these\r\nvisitors were made the basis of parliamentary action. On the face of\r\nthem they represent a condition of human depravity which has rarely\r\nbeen equalled;[947] and the extent to which those reports are worthy\r\nof credit will always remain a point of contention. The visitors\r\nthemselves were men of doubtful character; indeed, respectable men\r\ncould hardly have been persuaded to do the work. Their methods were\r\ncertainly harsh; the object of their mission was to get up a case for\r\nthe Crown, and they probably used every means in their power to induce\r\nthe monks and the nuns to incriminate themselves. Perhaps, too, an\r\nentirely false impression may be created by the fact that in most\r\ncases only the guilty are mentioned; the innocent are often passed\r\nover in silence, and the proportion between the two is not recorded.\r\nSome of the terms employed in the reports are also open to dispute; it\r\nis possible that in many instances the stigma of unchastity        (p. 338)\r\nattached to a nun merely meant that she had been unchaste before\r\nentering religion,[948] and it is known that nunneries were considered\r\nthe proper resort for ladies who had not been careful enough of their\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 947: See the documents in _L. and P._,\r\n                   vols. ix., x. The most elaborate criticism of the\r\n                   Dissolution is contained in Gasquet's _Henry VIII.\r\n                   and the Monasteries_, 2 vols., 4th ed. 1893; some\r\n                   additional details and an excellent monastic map\r\n                   will be found in Gairdner's _Church History_,\r\n                   1902.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 948: \"Religion\" of course in the middle\r\n                   ages and sixteenth century was a term almost\r\n                   exclusively applied to the monastic system, and the\r\n                   most ludicrous mistakes are often made from\r\n                   ignorance of this fact; \"religiosi\" are sharply\r\n                   distinguished from \"clerici\".]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the lax state of monastic morality does not depend\r\nonly upon the visitors' reports; apart from satires like those of\r\nSkelton, from ballads and from other mirrors of popular opinion or\r\nprejudice, the correspondence of Henry VIII.'s reign is, from its\r\ncommencement, full of references, by bishops and other unimpeachable\r\nwitnesses, to the necessity of drastic reform. In 1516, for instance,\r\nBishop West of Ely visited that house, and found such disorder that he\r\ndeclared its continuance would have been impossible but for his\r\nvisitation.[949] In 1518 the Italian Bishop of Worcester writes from\r\nRome that he had often been struck by the necessity of reforming the\r\nmonasteries.[950] In 1521 Henry VIII., then at the height of his zeal\r\nfor the Church, thanks the Bishop of Salisbury for dissolving the\r\nnunnery of Bromehall because of the \"enormities\" practised there.[951]\r\nWolsey felt that the time for reform had passed, and began the process\r\nof suppression, with a view to increasing the number of cathedrals and\r\ndevoting other proceeds to educational endowments. Friar Peto,\r\nafterwards a cardinal, who had fled abroad to escape Henry's anger for\r\nhis bold denunciation of the divorce, and who had no possible      (p. 339)\r\nmotive for cloaking his conscientious opinion, admitted that there\r\nwere grave abuses, and approved of the dissolution of monasteries, if\r\ntheir endowments were used for proper ends.[952] There is no need to\r\nmultiply instances, because a commission of cardinals, appointed by\r\nPaul III. himself, reported in 1537 that scandals were frequent in\r\nreligious houses.[953] The reports of the visitors, too, can hardly be\r\nentirely false, though they may not be entirely true. The charges they\r\nmake are not vague, but very precise. They specify names of the\r\noffenders, and the nature of their offences; and an air of verisimilitude,\r\nif nothing more, is imparted to the condemnations they pronounce\r\nagainst the many, by the commendations they bestow on the few.[954]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 949: _L. and P._, ii., 1733.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 950: _Ibid._, ii., 4399.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 951: _Ibid._, iii., 1863; see also iii.,\r\n                   77, 533, 567, 569, 600, 693, 1690; iv. 4900.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 952: _D.N.B._, xlv., 89.

So, too, the charges are not\r\n                   naturally incredible, because the kind of vice\r\n                   alleged against the monks has unfortunately been\r\n                   far from unknown wherever and whenever numbers of\r\n                   men, young or middle-aged, have lived together in\r\n                   enforced celibacy.]\r\n\r\nProbably the staunchest champion of monasticism would acknowledge that\r\nin the reign of Henry VIII. there was at least a plausible case for\r\nmending monastic morals. But that was not then the desire of the\r\nGovernment of Henry VIII.; and the case for mending their morals was\r\ntacitly assumed to be the same as a case for ending the monasteries.\r\nIt would be unjust to Henry to deny that he had always shown himself\r\ncareful of the appearance, at least, of morality in the Church; but\r\nit requires a robust faith in the King's disinterestedness to      (p. 340)\r\nbelieve that dissolution was not the real object of the visitation,\r\nand that it was merely forced upon him by the reports of the visitors.\r\nThe moral question afforded a good excuse, but the monasteries fell,\r\nnot so much because their morals were lax, as because their position\r\nwas weak. Moral laxity contributed no doubt to the general result, but\r\nthere were other causes at work. The monasteries themselves had long\r\nbeen conscious that their possession of wealth was not, in the eyes of\r\nthe middle-class laity, justified by the use to which it was put; and,\r\nfor some generations at least, they had been seeking to make friends\r\nwith Mammon by giving up part of their revenues, in the form of\r\npensions and corrodies to courtiers, in the hope of being allowed to\r\nretain the remainder.[955] It had also become the custom to entrust\r\nthe stewardship of their possessions to secular hands; and, possibly\r\nas a result, the monasteries were soon so deeply in debt to the\r\nneighbouring gentry that their lay creditors saw no hope of recovering\r\ntheir claims except by extensive foreclosures.[956] There had certainly\r\nbeen a good deal of private spoliation before the King gave the practice\r\na national character. The very privileges of the monasteries were now\r\nturned to their ruin. Their immunity from episcopal jurisdiction\r\ndeprived them of episcopal aid; their exemption from all authority,\r\nsave that of the Pope, left them without support when the papal\r\njurisdiction was abolished. Monastic orders knew no distinction    (p. 341)\r\nof nationality. The national character claimed for the mediaeval Church\r\nin England could scarcely cover the monasteries, and no place was\r\nfound for them in the Church when it was given a really national garb.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 955: See Fortescue, _Governance of\r\n                   England_, ed. Plummer, cap. xviii., and notes, pp.\r\n                   337-40.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 956: _E.g._, Christ Church, London, which\r\n                   surrendered to Henry in 1532, was deeply in debt to\r\n                   him (_L. and P._, v., 823).]\r\n\r\nTheir dissolution is probably to be connected with Cromwell's boast\r\nthat he would make his king the richest prince in Christendom. That\r\nwas not its effect, because Henry was compelled to distribute the greater\r\npart of the spoils among his nobles and gentry. One rash reformer\r\nsuggested that monastic lands should be devoted to educational\r\npurposes;[957] had that plan been followed, education in England would\r\nhave been more magnificently endowed than in any other country of the\r\nworld, and England might have become a democracy in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. From this point of view Henry spoilt one of the greatest\r\nopportunities in English history; from another, he saved England from\r\na most serious danger. Had the Crown retained the wealth of the\r\nmonasteries, the Stuarts might have made themselves independent of\r\nParliament. But this service to liberty was not voluntary on Henry's\r\npart. The dissolution of the monasteries was in effect, and probably\r\nin intention, a gigantic bribe to the laity to induce them to\r\nacquiesce in the revolution effected by Henry VIII. When he was gone,\r\nhis successors might desire, or fail to prevent, a reaction; something\r\nmore permanent than Henry's iron hand was required to support the  (p. 342)\r\nfabric he had raised. That support was sought in the wealth of the\r\nChurch. The prospect had, from the very opening of the Reformation\r\nParliament, been dangled before the eyes of the new nobles, the\r\nmembers of Parliament, the justices of the peace, the rich merchants\r\nwho thirsted for lands wherewith to make themselves gentlemen. Chapuys\r\nagain and again mentions a scheme for distributing the lands of the\r\nChurch among the laity as a project for the ensuing session; but their\r\ntime was not yet; not until their work was done were the labourers to\r\nreap their reward.[958] The dissolution of the monasteries harmonised\r\nwell with the secular principles of these predominant classes. The\r\nmonastic ideal of going out of the world to seek something, which\r\ncannot be valued in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, is abhorrent\r\nto a busy, industrial age; and every principle is hated most at the\r\ntime when it most is needed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 957: _The Complaynt of Roderick Mors_\r\n                   (Early Eng.

Some of the political literature of the later\r\n                   part of Henry's reign is curiously modern in its\r\n                   ideas.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIntimately associated as they were in their lives, Catherine of Aragon\r\nand Anne Boleyn were not long divided by death; and, piteous as is the\r\nstory of the last years of Catherine, it pales before the hideous\r\ntragedy of the ruin of Anne Boleyn. \"If I have a son, as I hope shortly,\r\nI know what will become of her,\" wrote Anne of the Princess Mary.[959]\r\nOn 29th January, 1536, the day of her rival's funeral, Anne Boleyn was\r\nprematurely delivered of a dead child, and the result was fatal to\r\nAnne herself. This was not her first miscarriage,[960] and Henry's (p. 343)\r\nold conscience began to work again. In Catherine's case the path of\r\nhis conscience was that of a slow and laborious pioneer; now it moved\r\neasily on its royal road to divorce. On 29th January, Chapuys, ignorant\r\nof Anne's miscarriage, was retailing to his master a court rumour that\r\nHenry intended to marry again. The King was reported to have said that\r\nhe had been seduced by witchcraft when he married his second queen,\r\nand that the marriage was null for this reason, and because God would\r\nnot permit them to have male issue.[961] There was no peace for her\r\nwho supplanted her mistress. Within six months of her marriage Henry's\r\nroving fancy had given her cause for jealousy, and, when she complained,\r\nhe is said to have brutally told her she must put up with it as her\r\nbetters had done before.[962] These disagreements, however, were\r\ndescribed by Chapuys as mere lovers' quarrels, and they were generally\r\nfollowed by reconciliations, after which Anne's influence seemed   (p. 344)\r\nas secure as ever. But by January, 1536, the imperial ambassador and\r\nothers were counting on a fresh divorce. The rumour grew as spring\r\nadvanced, when suddenly, on 2nd May, Anne was arrested and sent to the\r\nTower. She was accused of incest with her brother, Lord Rochford, and\r\nof less criminal intercourse with Sir Francis Weston, Henry Norris,\r\nWilliam Brereton, and Mark Smeaton. All were condemned by juries to\r\ndeath for high treason on 12th May. Three days later Anne herself was\r\nput on her trial by a panel of twenty-six peers, over which her uncle,\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, presided.[963] They returned a unanimous verdict\r\nof guilty, and, on the 19th, the Queen's head was struck off with the\r\nsword of an executioner brought for the purpose from St. Omer.[964]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 958: \"The King,\" says Chapuys in\r\n                   September, 1534, \"will distribute among the\r\n                   gentlemen of the kingdom the greater part of the\r\n                   ecclesiastical revenues to gain their good-will\"\r\n                   (_L. and P._, vii., 1141).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 959: _Ibid._, x., 307.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 960: Anne was pregnant in Feb., 1534,\r\n                   when Henry told Chapuys he thought he should have a\r\n                   son soon (_L. and P._, vii., 232; _cf._, vii.,\r\n                   958).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 961: _Ibid._, x., 199.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 962: _Ibid._, vi., 1054, 1069. As early\r\n                   as April, 1531, Chapuys reports that Anne \"was\r\n                   becoming more arrogant every day, using words and\r\n                   authority towards the King of which he has several\r\n                   times complained to the Duke of Norfolk, saying\r\n                   that she was not like the Queen [Catherine] who\r\n                   never in her life used ill words to him\" (_ibid._,\r\n                   v., 216). In Sept., 1534, Henry was reported to be\r\n                   in love with another lady (_ibid._, vii., 1193,\r\n                   1257). Probably this was Jane Seymour, as the\r\n                   lady's kindness to the Princess Mary--a marked\r\n                   characteristic of Queen Jane--is noted by Chapuys.\r\n                   This intrigue, we are told, was furthered by many\r\n                   lords with the object of separating the King from\r\n                   Anne Boleyn, who was disliked by the lords on\r\n                   account of her pride and that of her kinsmen and\r\n                   brothers (_ibid._, vii., 1279). Henry's behaviour\r\n                   to the Princess was becoming quite benevolent, and\r\n                   Chapuys begins to speak of his \"amiable and cordial\r\n                   nature\" (_ibid._, vii., 1297).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 963: In 1533 Anne had accused her uncle\r\n                   of having too much intercourse with Chapuys and of\r\n                   maintaining the Princess Mary's title to the throne\r\n                   (_L. and P._, vi., 1125).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 964: _Ibid._, x., 902, 910, 919. The\r\n                   Regent Mary of the Netherlands writes: \"That the\r\n                   vengeance might be executed by the Emperor's\r\n                   subjects, he sent for the executioner of St. Omer,\r\n                   as there were none in England good enough\"\r\n                   (_ibid._, x., 965). It is perhaps well to be\r\n                   reminded that even at this date there were more\r\n                   practised executioners in the Netherlands than in\r\n                   England.]\r\n\r\nTwo days before Anne's death her marriage with Henry had been declared\r\ninvalid by a court of ecclesiastical lawyers with Cranmer at its head.\r\nThe grounds of the sentence are not stated, but there may have been\r\ntwo--the alleged precontract with the Earl of Northumberland, which\r\nthe Earl denied on oath and on the sacrament, and the previous\r\naffinity between Anne and Henry arising from the King's relations with\r\nMary Boleyn. The latter seems the more probable. Henry had obtained of\r\nClement VII. a dispensation from this disability; but the Pope's\r\npower to dispense had since been repudiated, while the canonical   (p. 345)\r\nobjection remained and was given statutory authority in this very\r\nyear.[965] The effects of this piece of wanton injustice were among\r\nthe troubles which Henry bequeathed to Queen Elizabeth; the sole\r\nadvantage to Henry was that his infidelities to Anne ceased to be\r\nbreaches of the seventh commandment. The justice of her sentence to\r\ndeath is also open to doubt. Anne herself went to the block boldly\r\nproclaiming her innocence.[966] Death she regarded as a relief from an\r\nintolerable situation, and she \"laughed heartily,\" writes the Lieutenant\r\nof the Tower as she put her hands round her \"little neck,\" and thought\r\nhow easy the executioner's task would be.[967] She complained when the\r\nday of her release from this world was deferred, and regretted that so\r\nmany innocent persons should suffer through her. Of her accomplices,\r\nnone confessed but Smeaton, though Henry is said, before Anne's\r\narrest, to have offered Norris a pardon if he would admit his crime.\r\nOn the other hand, her conduct must have made the charges plausible.\r\nEven in those days, when justice to individuals was regarded as dust\r\nif weighed in the balance against the real or supposed interests of\r\nthe State, it is not credible that the juries should have found her\r\naccomplices guilty, that twenty-six peers, including her uncle,    (p. 346)\r\nshould have condemned Anne herself, without some colourable justification.\r\nIf the charges were merely invented to ruin the Queen, one culprit\r\nbesides herself would have been enough. To assume that Henry sent four\r\nneedless victims to the block is to accuse him of a lust for\r\nsuperfluous butchery, of which even he, in his most bloodthirsty\r\nmoments, was not capable.[968]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 965: This Act indirectly made Elizabeth a\r\n                   bastard and Henry's marriage with Anne invalid,\r\n                   (_cf._ Chapuys to Granvelle _L. and P._, x., 909).\r\n                   The Antinomian theory of marital relations, which\r\n                   Chapuys ascribes to Anne, was an Anabaptist\r\n                   doctrine of the time. Chapuys calls Anne a\r\n                   Messalina, but he of course was not an impartial\r\n                   witness.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 966: According to some accounts, but a\r\n                   Spaniard who writes as an eye-witness says she\r\n                   cried \"mercy to God and the King for the offence\r\n                   she had done\" (_L. and P._, x., 911).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 967: _Ibid._, x., 910.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 968: The execution of Anne was welcomed\r\n                   by the Imperialists and Catholics, and it is\r\n                   possible that it was hastened on by rumours of\r\n                   disquiet in the North. A few days later the nobles\r\n                   and gentry who were in London were ordered to\r\n                   return home to put the country in a state of\r\n                   defence (_L. and P._, x., 1016).]\r\n\r\nOn the day that his second queen was beheaded, Henry obtained from\r\nCranmer a special licence to marry a third.[969] He was betrothed on\r\nthe morrow and privately married \"in the Queen's closet at York Place\"\r\non the 30th of May. The lady of his choice was Jane, daughter of Sir\r\nJohn Seymour of Wolf Hall in Wiltshire.[970] She was descended on her\r\nmother's side from Edward III., and Cranmer had to dispense with a\r\ncanonical bar to the marriage arising from her consanguinity to the\r\nKing in the third and fourth degrees. She had been lady-in-waiting to\r\nthe two previous queens, and her brother, Sir Edward Seymour, the\r\nfuture Protector, had for years been steadily rising in Henry's\r\nfavour. In October, 1535, the King had paid a visit to Wolf Hall, and\r\nfrom that time his attentions to Jane became marked. She seems to have\r\nreceived them with real reluctance; she refused a purse of gold and\r\nreturned the King's letters unopened.[971] She even obtained a     (p. 347)\r\npromise from Henry that he would not speak with her except in the\r\npresence of others, and the King ejected Cromwell from his rooms in\r\nthe Palace in order to bestow them on Sir Edward Seymour, and thus to\r\nprovide a place where he and Jane could converse without scandal. All\r\nthis modesty has, of course, been attributed to prudential and\r\nambitious motives, which were as wise as they were successful. But\r\nJane seems to have had no enemies, except Alexander Aless, who\r\ndenounced her to Luther as an enemy to the Gospel, probably because\r\nshe extinguished the shining light of Anne Boleyn.[972] Cardinal Pole\r\ndescribed her as \"full of goodness,\"[973] and she certainly did her\r\nbest to reconcile Henry with his daughter the Princess Mary, whose\r\ntreatment began to improve from the fall of Anne Boleyn. \"She is,\"\r\nwrites Chapuys, \"of middle stature, and no great beauty; so fair that\r\none would call her rather pale than otherwise.\"[974] But all agreed in\r\npraising her intelligence. She had neither Catherine's force of\r\ncharacter nor the temper of Anne Boleyn; she was a woman of gentle\r\nspirit, striving always to mitigate the rigour of others; her brief\r\nmarried life was probably happier than that of any other of Henry's\r\nQueens; and her importance is mainly due to the fact that she bore to\r\nHenry his only legitimate son.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 969: _Ibid._ x., 915, 926, 993, 1000.\r\n                   There is a persistent fable that they were married\r\n                   on the day or the day after Anne's execution; Dr.\r\n                   Gairdner says it is repeated \"in all histories\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 970: See _Wilts Archaeol. Mag._, vols xv.,\r\n                   xvi., documents printed from the _Longleat MSS._]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 971: _L. and P._, x., 245.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 972: Luther, _Briefe_, v., 22; _L. and\r\n                   P._, xi., 475.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 973: Strype, _Eccl. Memorials_, I., ii.,\r\n                   304.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 974: _L. and P._, x., 901.]\r\n\r\nThe disgrace of Anne Boleyn necessitated the summons of a fresh\r\nParliament to put the succession to the crown on yet another basis.\r\nThe Long Parliament had been dissolved on 14th April; another was\r\ncalled to meet on the 8th of June. The eighteen acts passed during its\r\nsix weeks' session illustrate the parallel development of the      (p. 348)\r\nReformation and of the royal autocracy. The Act of Succession made\r\nAnne's daughter, Elizabeth, a bastard, without declaring Catherine's\r\ndaughter, Mary, legitimate, and settled the crown on Henry's\r\nprospective issue by Jane. A unique clause empowered the King to\r\ndispose of the crown at will, should he have no issue by his present\r\nQueen.[975] Probably he intended it, in that case, for the Duke of\r\nRichmond; but the Duke's days were numbered, and four days after the\r\ndissolution of Parliament he breathed his last. The royal prerogative\r\nwas extended by a statute enabling a king, when he reached the age of\r\ntwenty-four, to repeal by proclamation any act passed during his\r\nminority; and the royal caste was further exalted by a statute making\r\nit high treason for any one to marry a king's daughter, legitimate or\r\nnot, his sister, his niece, or his aunt on the father's side, without\r\nroyal licence. The reform of clerical abuses was advanced by an act to\r\nprevent non-residence, and by another to obviate the delay in\r\ninstituting to benefices practised by bishops with a view to       (p. 349)\r\nkeeping the tithes of the vacant benefice in their own hands. The\r\nbreach with Rome was widened still further by a statute, declaring all\r\nwho extolled the Pope's authority to be guilty of _praemunire_,\r\nimposing an oath of renunciation on all lay and clerical officers, and\r\nmaking the refusal of that oath high treason. Thus the hopes of a\r\nreaction built on the fall of those \"apostles of the new sect,\" Anne\r\nBoleyn and her relatives, were promptly and roughly destroyed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 975: Parliament prefered to risk the\r\n                   results of Henry's nomination to the risk of civil\r\n                   war, which would inevitably have broken out had\r\n                   Henry died in 1536. Hobbes, it may be noted, made\r\n                   this power of nomination an indispensable attribute\r\n                   of the sovereign, and if the sovereign be\r\n                   interpreted as the \"King in Parliament\" the theory\r\n                   is sound constitutionalism and was put in practice\r\n                   in 1701 as well as in 1536. But the limitations on\r\n                   Henry's power of bequeathing the crown have\r\n                   generally been forgotten; he never had power to\r\n                   leave the crown away from Edward VI., that is, away\r\n                   from the only heir whose legitimacy was undisputed.\r\n                   The later acts went further, and entailed the\r\n                   succession upon Mary and Elizabeth unless Henry\r\n                   wished otherwise--which he did not. The preference\r\n                   of the Suffolk to the Stuart line may have been due\r\n                   to (1) the common law forbidding aliens to inherit\r\n                   English land (_cf. L. and P._, vii., 337); (2) the\r\n                   national dislike of the Scots; (3) a desire to\r\n                   intimate to the Scots that if they would not unite\r\n                   the two realms by the marriage of Edward and Mary,\r\n                   they should not obtain the English crown by\r\n                   inheritance.]\r\n\r\nHenry's position had been immensely strengthened alike by the death of\r\nCatherine of Aragon and by the fall of Anne Boleyn; and on both\r\noccasions he had expressed his appreciation of the fact in the most\r\nindecent and heartless manner. He was now free to marry whom he liked,\r\nand no objection based on canon or on any other law could be raised to\r\nthe legitimacy of his future issue; whether the Pope could dispense or\r\nnot, it made no difference to Edward VI.'s claim to the throne. The\r\nfall of Anne Boleyn, in spite of some few rumours that she might have\r\nbeen condemned on insufficient evidence, was generally popular; for\r\nher arrogance and that of her family made them hated, and they were\r\nregarded as the cause of the King's persecution of Catherine, of Mary,\r\nand of those who maintained their cause. Abroad the effect was still\r\nmore striking. The moment Henry heard of Catherine's death, he added a\r\npostscript to Cromwell's despatch to the English ambassadors in\r\nFrance, bidding them to take a higher tone with Francis, for all cause\r\nof difference had been removed between him and Charles V.[976] The\r\nEmperor secretly believed that his aunt had been poisoned,[977] but\r\nthat private grief was not to affect his public policy; and Charles,\r\nFrancis, and even the Pope, became more or less eager competitors  (p. 350)\r\nfor Henry's favour. The bull of deprivation, which had been drawn up\r\nand signed, became a dead letter, and every one was anxious to disavow\r\nhis share in its promotion. Charles obtained the suspension of its\r\npublication, made a merit of that service to Henry, and tried to\r\nrepresent that it was Francis who, with his eyes on the English crown,\r\nhad extorted the bull from the Pope.[978] Paul III. himself used words\r\nto the English envoy at Rome, which might be interpreted as an apology\r\nfor having made Fisher a cardinal and having denounced his and More's\r\nexecution.[979]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 976: _L. and P._, x., 54.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 977: _Ibid._, x., 230.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 978: _L. and P._, x., 887.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 979: _Ibid._, x., 977.]\r\n\r\nHenry had been driven by fear of Charles in the previous year to make\r\nfurther advances than he relished towards union with the German\r\nprinces; but the Lutherans could not be persuaded to adopt Henry's\r\nviews of the mass and of his marriage with Catherine; and now he was\r\nglad to substitute an understanding with the Emperor for intrigues\r\nwith the Emperor's subjects.[980] Cromwell and the council were,\r\nindeed, a little too eager to welcome Chapuys' professions of friendship\r\nand to entertain his demands for help against Francis. Henry allowed\r\nthem to go on for a time; but Cromwell was never in Wolsey's position,\r\nand the King was not inclined to repeat his own and the Cardinal's\r\nerrors of 1521. He had suffered enough from the prostration of France\r\nand the predominance of Charles; and he was anxious now that neither\r\nshould be supreme. So, when the imperial ambassador came expecting\r\nHenry's assent, he, Cromwell and the rest of the council were      (p. 351)\r\namazed to hear the King break out into an uncompromising defence\r\nof the French King's conduct in invading Savoy and Piedmont.[981] That\r\ninvasion was the third stroke of good fortune which befel Henry in\r\n1536. As Henry and Ferdinand had, in 1512, diverted their arms from\r\nthe Moors in order to make war on the Most Christian King, so, in\r\n1536, the Most Christian King and the sovereign, who was at once King\r\nCatholic and the temporal head of Christendom, instead of turning\r\ntheir arms against the monarch who had outraged and defied the Church,\r\nturned them against one another. Francis had never lost sight of\r\nMilan; he had now recovered from the effects of Pavia; and in the\r\nspring of 1536 he overran Savoy and Piedmont. In April the Emperor\r\nonce more visited Rome, and on the 17th he delivered a famous oration\r\nin the papal Consistory.[982] In that speech he denounced neither\r\nLuther nor Henry VIII.; he reserved his invectives for Francis I.\r\nUnconsciously he demonstrated once and for all that unity of faith was\r\nimpotent against diversity of national interests, and that, whatever\r\ndeference princes might profess to the counsels of the Vicar of\r\nChrist, the counsels they would follow would be those of secular\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 980: _Cf._ Stern, _Heinrich VIII. und der\r\n                   Schmalkaldische Bund_, and P.

The dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries inevitably inflicted considerable hardship on a numerous\r\nbody of men. It had been arranged that the inmates of the dissolved\r\nreligious houses should either be pensioned or transferred to other\r\nmonasteries; but, although the pensions were adequate and          (p. 352)\r\nsometimes even generous in scale,[983] and although the commissioners\r\nthemselves showed a desire to prevent unnecessary trouble by obtaining\r\nlicences for many houses to continue for a time,[984] the monks found\r\nsome difficulty in obtaining their pensions, and Chapuys draws a\r\nmoving picture of their sufferings as they wandered about the country,\r\nseeking employment in a market that was already overstocked with\r\nlabour, and endeavouring to earn a livelihood by means to which they\r\nhad never been accustomed.[985] They met with no little sympathy from\r\nthe commons, who were oppressed with a like scarcity of work, and who\r\nhad looked to the monasteries for such relief as charity could afford.\r\nNowhere were these feelings so strong as in the north of England, and\r\nthere the commissioners for dissolving the monasteries were often met\r\nwith open resistance. Religious discontent was one of the motives for\r\nrevolt, but probably the rebels were drawn mainly[986] from evicted\r\ntenants, deprived of their holdings by enclosures or by the conversion\r\nof land from tillage to pasture, men who had nothing to lose and\r\neverything to gain by a general turmoil. In these men the wandering\r\nmonks found ready listeners to their complaints, and there were    (p. 353)\r\nothers, besides the monks, who eagerly turned to account the prevailing\r\ndissatisfaction. The northern lords, Darcy and Hussey, had for years\r\nbeen representing to Chapuys the certainty of success if the Emperor\r\ninvaded England, and promising to do their part when he came. Darcy\r\nhad, at Christmas 1534, sent the imperial ambassador a sword as an\r\nintimation that the time had come for an appeal to its arbitrament;\r\nand he was seeking Henry's licence to return to his house in Yorkshire\r\nin order to raise \"the crucifix\" as the standard of revolt.[987] The\r\nKing, however, was doubtful of Darcy's loyalty, and kept him in London\r\ntill early in 1536. It would have been well had he kept him longer.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 983: _E.g._, the Prioress of Tarent\r\n                   received L100 a year, the Abbot of Evesham, L240\r\n                   (Gasquet, ii., 230, 310); these sums must be\r\n                   multiplied by ten to bring them to their present\r\n                   value. Most of these lavish pensions were doubtless\r\n                   given as bribes or rewards for the surrender of\r\n                   monasteries.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 984: _L. and P._, xi., 385, 519.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 985: _Ibid._, xi., 42.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 986: The exact proportion is of course\r\n                   difficult to determine; Mr. E.F.

They were undoubtedly present in large\r\n                   numbers; but my remark is intended to guard against\r\n                   the theory that the grievances were entirely\r\n                   religious, not to exclude those grievances; and the\r\n                   northern lords were of course notable examples of\r\n                   the discontent of the propertied class.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 987: _L. and P._, vii., 1206; viii., 48.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the summer rumours[988] were spread among the\r\ncommons of the North that heavy taxes would be levied on every burial,\r\nwedding and christening, that all cattle would be marked and pay a\r\nfine to the King, and that all unmarked beasts would be forfeit;\r\nchurches within five miles of each other were to be taken down as\r\nsuperfluous, jewels and church plate confiscated; taxes were to be\r\npaid for eating white bread, goose, or capon; there was to be a rigid\r\ninquisition into every man's property; and a score of other absurdities\r\ngained currency, obviously invented by malicious and lying tongues.\r\nThe outbreak began at Caistor, in Lincolnshire, on the 3rd of October,\r\nwith resistance, not to the commissioners for dissolving the\r\nmonasteries, but to those appointed to collect the subsidy granted by\r\nParliament. The rebels entered Lincoln on the 6th; they could, they\r\nsaid, pay no more money; they demanded the repeal of religious\r\nchanges, the restoration of the monasteries, the banishment of     (p. 354)\r\nheretics like Cranmer and Latimer, and the removal of low-born\r\nadvisers such as Cromwell and Rich from the council.[989] The\r\nmustering of an army under Suffolk and the denial by heralds and\r\nothers that the King had any such intentions as were imputed to him,\r\ninduced the commons to go home; the reserves which Henry was\r\ncollecting at Ampthill were disbanded; and the commotion was over in\r\nless than a fortnight.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 988: _Ibid._, xi., 768, 826[2].]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 989: _L. and P._, xi., 786, 1182, 1244,\r\n                   1246.]\r\n\r\nThe Lincolnshire rebels, however, had not dispersed when news arrived\r\nof a much more serious rising which affected nearly the whole of\r\nYorkshire. It was here that Darcy and his friends were most powerful;\r\nbut, though there is little doubt that they were the movers, the\r\nostensible leader was Robert Aske, a lawyer. Even here the rebellion\r\nwas little more than a magnified riot, which a few regiments of\r\nsoldiers could soon have suppressed. The rebels professed complete\r\nloyalty to Henry's person; they suggested no rival candidate for the\r\nthrone; they merely demanded a change of policy, which they could not\r\nenforce without a change of government. They had no means of effecting\r\nthat change without deposing Henry, which they never proposed to do,\r\nand which, had they done it, could only have resulted in anarchy. The\r\nrebellion was formidable mainly because Henry had no standing army; he\r\nhad to rely almost entirely on the goodwill or at least acquiescence\r\nof his people. Outside Yorkshire the gentry were willing enough;\r\npossibly they had their eyes on monastic rewards; and they sent to\r\nCambridge double[990] or treble the forces Henry demanded, which   (p. 355)\r\nthey could hardly have done had their tenants shown any great sympathy\r\nwith the rebellion. But transport in those days was more difficult\r\neven than now; and before the musters could reach the Trent, Darcy,\r\nafter a show of reluctance, yielded Pomfret Castle to the rebels and\r\nswore to maintain their cause. Henry was forced, much against his\r\nwill, to temporise. To pardon or parley with rebels he thought would\r\ndistain his honour.[991] If Norfolk was driven to offer a pardon, he\r\nmust on no account involve the King in his promise.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 990: Surrey to Norfolk, 15th Oct., xi.,\r\n                   727, 738.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 991: _L. and P._, xi., 864.]\r\n\r\nNorfolk apparently had no option. An armistice was accordingly\r\narranged on the 27th of October, and a deputation came up to lay the\r\nrebels' grievances before the King. It was received graciously, and\r\nHenry's reply was a masterly piece of statecraft.[992] He drew it up\r\n\"with his own hand, and made no creature privy thereto until it was\r\nfinished\". Their complaints about the Faith were, he said, \"so general\r\nthat hard they be to be answered,\" but he intended always to live and\r\nto die in the faith of Christ. They must specify what they meant by\r\nthe liberties of the Church, whether they were lawful or unlawful\r\nliberties; but he had done nothing inconsistent with the laws of God\r\nand man. With regard to the Commonwealth, what King had kept his\r\nsubjects so long in wealth and peace, ministering indifferent justice,\r\nand defending them from outward enemies? There were more low-born\r\ncouncillors when he came to the throne than now; then there were \"but\r\ntwo worth calling noble.[993] Others, as the Lords Marny and Darcy,\r\nwere scant well-born gentlemen, and yet of no great lands till     (p. 356)\r\nthey were promoted by us. The rest were lawyers and priests.... How\r\ncame you to think that there were more noble men in our Privy Council\r\nthen than now?\" It did not become them to dictate to their sovereign\r\nwhom he should call to his Council; yet, if they could prove, as they\r\nalleged, that certain of the Council were subverters of God's law and\r\nthe laws of the realm, he would proceed against them. Then, after\r\ndenouncing their rebellion and referring to their request for pardon,\r\nhe says: \"To show our pity, we are content, if we find you penitent,\r\nto grant you all letters of pardon on your delivering to us ten such\r\nringleaders of this rebellion as we shall assign to you. Now note the\r\nbenignity of your Prince, and how easily bloodshed may be eschewed.\r\nThus I, as your head, pray for you, my members, that God may enlighten\r\nyou for your benefit.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 992: _Ibid._, xi., 957.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 993: The records of the Privy Council for\r\n                   the greater part of Henry's reign have disappeared,\r\n                   and only a rough list of his privy Councillors can\r\n                   be gathered from the _Letters and Papers_. Surrey,\r\n                   of course, was one of the two nobles, and probably\r\n                   Shrewsbury was the other, though Oxford, whose\r\n                   peerage was older than theirs, seems also to have\r\n                   been a member of the Privy Council (_L. and P._,\r\n                   i., 51). The complaint of the rebels applied to the\r\n                   whole Tudor period; at Henry's death no member of\r\n                   his Privy Council held a peerage twelve years old.]\r\n\r\nA conference was held at Doncaster in December,[994] and towards the\r\nend of the year Aske came at Henry's invitation to discuss the\r\ncomplaints with him.[995] No one could be more gracious than the King,\r\nwhen he chose; no one could mask his resentment more completely, when\r\nhe had an object to gain. It was important to win over Aske, and\r\nconvince him that Henry had the interests of the rebels at heart. So\r\non Aske were lavished all the royal arts. They were amply          (p. 357)\r\nrewarded. In January, 1537, the rebel leader went down to Yorkshire\r\nfully convinced of the King's goodwill, and anxious only that the\r\ncommons should observe his conditions.[996] But there were wilder\r\nspirits at work over which he had little control. They declared that\r\nthey were betrayed. Plots were formed to seize Hull and Scarborough;\r\nboth were discovered.[997] Aske, Constable, and other leaders of the\r\noriginal Pilgrimage of Grace exerted themselves to stay this outbreak\r\nof their more violent followers; and between moderates and extremists\r\nthe whole movement quickly collapsed. The second revolt gave Henry an\r\nexcuse for recalling his pardon, and for exacting revenge from all who\r\nhad been implicated in either movement. Darcy deserved little pity;\r\nthe earliest in his treason, he continued the game to the end; but\r\nAske was an honest man, and his execution, condemned though he was by\r\na jury, was a violent act of injustice.[998] Norfolk was sent to the\r\nNorth on a Bloody Assize,[999] and if neither he nor the King was a\r\nJeffreys, the rebellion was stamped out with a good deal of superfluous\r\ncruelty. Henry was resolved to do the work once and for all, and he\r\nbased his system on terror. His measures for the future government of\r\nthe North, now threatened by James V., were, however, wise on the\r\nwhole. He would put no more nobles in places of trust; the office of\r\nWarden of the Marches he took into his own hands, appointing three\r\ndeputies of somewhat humble rank for the east, middle and west\r\nmarches.[1000] A strong Council of the North was appointed to      (p. 358)\r\nsit at York, under the presidency of Tunstall, Bishop of Durham, and\r\nwith powers almost as extensive as those of the Privy Council at\r\nLondon; and henceforth Henry had little trouble from disaffection in\r\nEngland.[1001]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 994: _L. and P._, xi., 1244-46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 995: _Ibid._, xi., 1306.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 996: _L. and P._, XII., i., 20, 23, 43,\r\n                   44, 46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 997: _Ibid._, XII., i., 46, 64, 102, 104,\r\n                   141, 142.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 998: Henry, says Dr. Gairdner, examined\r\n                   \"the evidence sent up to him in the spirit of a\r\n                   detective policeman\" (XII., i., p. xxix.).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 999: _L. and P._, XII., i., 227, 228,\r\n                   401, 402, 416, 457, 458, 468, 478, 498.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1000: _L. and P._, XII., i., 594, 595,\r\n                   636, 667.

The\r\nopportunity had been too good for Paul III. to neglect; and early in\r\n1537 he had sent a legate _a latere_ to Flanders to do what he could\r\nto abet the rebellion.[1002] His choice fell on Reginald Pole, the son\r\nof the Countess of Salisbury and grandson of George, Duke of Clarence.\r\nPole had been one of Henry's great favourites; the King had paid for\r\nhis education, given him, while yet a layman, rich church preferments,\r\nand contributed the equivalent of about twelve hundred pounds a year\r\nto enable him to complete his studies in Italy.[1003] In 1530 Pole was\r\nemployed to obtain opinions at Paris favourable to Henry's divorce,[1004]\r\nand was offered the Archbishopric of York. He refused from\r\nconscientious scruples,[1005] sought in vain to turn the King from his\r\nevil ways, and, in 1532, left England; they parted friends, and Henry\r\ncontinued Pole's pensions. While Pole was regarding with increasing\r\ndisgust the King's actions, Henry still hoped that Pole was on his (p. 359)\r\nside, and, in 1536, in answer to Henry's request for his views, Pole\r\nsent his famous treatise _De Unitate Ecclesiae_. His heart was better\r\nthan his head; he thought Henry had been treated too gently, and that\r\nthe fulmination of a bull of excommunication earlier in his course\r\nwould have stopped his headlong career. To repair the Pope's omissions,\r\nPole now proceeded to administer the necessary castigation; \"flattery,\"\r\nhe said, \"had been the cause of all the evil\". Even his friend,\r\nCardinal Contarini, thought the book too bitter, and among his family\r\nin England it produced consternation.[1006] Some of them were hand in\r\nglove with Chapuys, who had suggested Pole to Charles as a candidate\r\nfor the throne; and his book might well have broken the thin ice on\r\nwhich they stood. Henry, however, suppressed his anger and invited\r\nPole to England; he, perhaps wisely, refused, but immediately\r\nafterwards he accepted the Pope's call to Rome, where he was made\r\ncardinal,[1007] and sent to Flanders as legate to foment the northern\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1002: _L. and P._, XII., i., 367, 368,\r\n                   779.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1003: _Ibid._, ii., 3943 (reference\r\n                   misprinted in _D.N.B._, xlvi., 35, as 3493); iii.,\r\n                   1544.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1004: _Ibid._, iv., 6003, 6252, 6383,\r\n                   6394, 6505.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1005: _Ibid._, v., 737.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1006: _L. and P._, x., 420, 426; xi., 72,\r\n                   93, 156.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1007: On 22nd December, 1536 (_Ibid._,\r\n                   xi., 1353).]\r\n\r\nHe came too late to do anything except exhibit his own and the papal\r\nimpotence. The rebellion was crushed before his commission was signed.\r\nAs Pole journeyed through France, Henry sent to demand his extradition\r\nas a traitor.[1008] With that request Francis could hardly comply, but\r\nhe ordered the legate to quit his dominions. Pole sought refuge in\r\nFlanders, but was stopped on the frontier. Charles could no more than\r\nFrancis afford to offend the English King, and the cardinal-legate was\r\ninformed that he might visit the Bishop of Liege, but only if he   (p. 360)\r\nwent in disguise.[1009] Never, wrote Pole to the Regent, had a papal\r\nlegate been so treated before. Truly Henry had fulfilled his boast\r\nthat he would show the princes of Europe how small was the power of a\r\nPope. He had obliterated every vestige of papal authority in England\r\nand defied the Pope to do his worst; and now, when the Pope attempted\r\nto do it, his legate was chased out of the dominions of the faithful\r\nsons of the Church at the demand of the excommunicate King. Henry had\r\ncome triumphant out of perils which every one else believed would\r\ndestroy him. He had carried England through the greatest revolution in\r\nher history. He had crushed the only revolt which that revolution\r\nevoked at home; and abroad the greatest princes of Europe had shown\r\nthat they valued as nothing the goodwill of the Pope against that of\r\nHenry VIII.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1008: _Ibid._ XII., i., 760, 939, 987,\r\n                   988, 996.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1009: _L. and P._, XII., i., 997, 1061,\r\n                   1135, 1167, 1174.]\r\n\r\nThe culminating point in his good fortune was reached in the following\r\nautumn. On the 12th of October, 1537, Queen Jane gave birth to a son.\r\nHenry had determined that, had he a son by Anne Boleyn, the child\r\nshould be named Henry after himself, or Edward after his grandfather,\r\nEdward IV. Queen Jane's son was born on the eve of the feast of St.\r\nEdward, and that fact decided the choice of his name. Twelve days\r\nlater the mother, who had never been crowned, passed away.[1010] She,\r\nalone of Henry's wives, was buried with royal pomp in St. George's\r\nChapel at Windsor; and to her alone the King paid the compliment   (p. 361)\r\nof mourning. His grief was sincere, and for the unusual space of more\r\nthan two years he remained without a wife. But Queen Jane's death was\r\nnot to be compared in importance with the birth of Edward VI. The\r\nlegitimate male heir, the object of so many desires and the cause of\r\nso many tragedies, had come at last to fill to the brim the cup of\r\nHenry's triumph. The greatest storm and stress of his reign was\r\npassed. There were crises to come, which might have been deemed\r\nserious in a less troubled reign, and they still needed all Henry's\r\nwary cunning to meet; Francis and Charles were even now preparing to\r\nend a struggle from which only Henry drew profit; and Paul was hoping\r\nto join them in war upon England. Yet Henry had weathered the worst of\r\nthe gale, and he now felt free to devote his energies to the extension\r\nabroad of the authority which he had established so firmly at home.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1010: The fable that the Caesarean\r\n                   operation was performed on her, invented or\r\n                   propagated by Nicholas Sanders, rests upon the\r\n                   further error repeated by most historians that\r\n                   Queen Jane died on the 14th of October, instead of\r\n                   the 24th (see Nichols, _Literary Remains of Edward\r\n                   VI._, pp. xxiv., xxv.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.                                                       (p. 362)\r\n\r\nREX ET IMPERATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the absence of \"Empire\" and \"Emperor\" from the various\r\ntitles which Henry VIII. possessed or assumed, he has more than one\r\nclaim to be reputed the father of modern imperialism. It is not till a\r\nyear after his death that we have any documentary evidence of an\r\nintention on the part of the English Government to unite England and\r\nScotland into one Empire, and to proclaim their sovereign the Emperor\r\nof Great Britain.[1011] But a marriage between Edward VI. and Mary,\r\nQueen of Scots, by which it was sought to effect that union, had been\r\nthe main object of Henry's efforts during the closing years of his\r\nreign, and the imperial idea was a dominant note in Henry's mind. No\r\nking was more fond of protesting that he wore an imperial crown and\r\nruled an imperial realm. When, in 1536, Convocation declared England\r\nto be \"an imperial See of itself,\" it only clothed in decent and\r\nformal language Henry's own boast that he was not merely King, but\r\nPope and Emperor, in his own domains. The rest of Western Europe was\r\nunder the temporal sway of Caesar, as it was under the spiritual sway\r\nof the Pope; but neither to one nor to the other did Henry owe any\r\nallegiance.[1012]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1011: Odet de Selve, _Corresp. Pol._, p.\r\n                   268.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1012: This was part of the revived\r\n                   influence of the Roman Civil Law in England which\r\n                   Professor Maitland has sketched in his _English\r\n                   Law and the Renaissance_, 1901. But the influence\r\n                   of these ideas extended into every sphere, and not\r\n                   least of all into the ecclesiastical. Englishmen,\r\n                   said Chapuys, were fond of tracing the King's\r\n                   imperial authority back to a grant from the Emperor\r\n                   Constantine--giving it thus an antiquity as great\r\n                   and an origin as authoritative as that claimed for\r\n                   the Pope by the false _Donation of Constantine_\r\n                   (_L. and P._, v., 45; vii., 232). This is the\r\n                   meaning of Henry's assertion that the Pope's\r\n                   authority in England was \"usurped,\" not that it was\r\n                   usurped at the expense of the English national\r\n                   Church, but at the expense of his prerogative. So,\r\n                   too, we find instructive complaints from a\r\n                   different sort of reformers that the reformation as\r\n                   effected by Henry VIII. was merely a _translatio\r\n                   imperii_ (_ibid._, XIV., ii., 141). Henry VIII.'s\r\n                   encouragement of the civil law was the natural\r\n                   counterpart of the prohibition of its study by Pope\r\n                   Honorius in 1219 and Innocent IV. in 1254 (Pollock\r\n                   and Maitland, i., 102, 103).]\r\n\r\nFor the word \"imperial\" itself he had shown a marked               (p. 363)\r\npredilection from his earliest days. _Henry Imperial_ was the name of\r\nthe ship in which his admiral hoisted his flag in 1513, and \"Imperial\"\r\nwas the name given to one of his favourite games. But, as his reign\r\nwore on, the word was translated into action, and received a more\r\ndefinite meaning. To mark his claim to supreme dignity, he assumed the\r\nstyle of \"His Majesty\" instead of that of \"His Grace,\" which he had\r\nhitherto shared with mere dukes and archbishops; and possibly \"His\r\nMajesty\" banished \"His Grace\" from Henry's mind no less than it did\r\nfrom his title. The story of his life is one of consistent, and more\r\nor less orderly, evolution. For many years he had been kept in\r\nleading-strings by Wolsey's and other clerical influences. The first\r\nstep in his self-assertion was to emancipate himself from this\r\ncontrol, and to vindicate his authority within the precincts of his\r\nCourt. His next was to establish his personal supremacy over Church\r\nand State in England; this was the work of the Reformation Parliament\r\nbetween 1529 and 1536. The final stage in the evolution was to     (p. 364)\r\nmake his rule more effective in the outlying parts of England, on\r\nthe borders of Scotland, in Wales and its Marches, and then to extend\r\nit over the rest of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nThe initial steps in the process of expanding the sphere of royal\r\nauthority had already been taken. The condition of Wales exercised the\r\nmind of King and Parliament, even in the throes of the struggle with\r\nRome.[1013] The \"manifold robberies, murders, thefts, trespasses,\r\nriots, routs, embraceries, maintenances, oppressions, ruptures of the\r\npeace, and many other malefacts, which be there daily practised,\r\nperpetrated, committed and done,\" obviously demanded prompt and swift\r\nredress, unless the redundant eloquence of parliamentary statutes\r\nprotested too much; and, in 1534, several acts were passed restraining\r\nlocal jurisdictions, and extending the authority of the President and\r\nCouncil of the Marches.[1014] Chapuys declared that the effect of\r\nthese acts was to rob the Welsh of their freedom, and he thought that\r\nthe probable discontent might be turned to account by stirring an\r\ninsurrection in favour of Catherine of Aragon and of the Catholic\r\nfaith.[1015] If, however, there was discontent, it did not make    (p. 365)\r\nitself effectively felt, and, in 1536, Henry proceeded to complete the\r\nunion of England and Wales. First, he adapted to Wales the institution\r\nof justices of the peace, which had proved the most efficient\r\ninstrument for the maintenance of his authority in England. A more\r\nimportant statute followed. Recalling the facts that \"the rights,\r\nusages, laws and customs\" in Wales \"be far discrepant from the laws\r\nand customs of this realm,\" that its people \"do daily use a speech\r\nnothing like, nor consonant to, the natural mother-tongue used within\r\nthis realm,\" and that \"some rude and ignorant people have made\r\ndistinction and diversity between the King's subjects of this realm\"\r\nand those of Wales, \"His Highness, of a singular zeal, love and\r\nfavour\" which he bore to the Welsh, minded to reduce them \"to the\r\nperfect order, notice and knowledge of his laws of this realm, and\r\nutterly to extirp, all and singular, the sinister usages and customs\r\ndiffering from the same\". The Principality was divided into shires,\r\nand the shires into hundreds; justice in every court, from the highest\r\nto the lowest, was to be administered in English, and in no other\r\ntongue; and no one who spoke Welsh was to \"have or enjoy any manner of\r\nOffice or Fees\" whatsoever. On the other hand, a royal commission was\r\nappointed to inquire into Welsh laws, and such as the King thought\r\nnecessary might still be observed; while the Welsh shires and boroughs\r\nwere to send members to the English Parliament. This statute was, to\r\nall effects and purposes, the first Act of Union in English history.\r\nSix years later a further act reorganised and developed the\r\njurisdiction of the Council of Wales and the Marches. Its functions\r\nwere to be similar to those of the Privy Council in London, of     (p. 366)\r\nwhich the Council of Wales, like that of the already established\r\nCouncil of the North, was an offshoot. Its object was to maintain\r\npeace with a firm hand in a specially disorderly district; and the\r\npowers, with which it was furnished, often conflicted with the common\r\nlaw of England,[1016] and rendered the Council's jurisdiction, like\r\nthat of other Tudor courts, a grievance to Stuart Parliaments.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1013: Cromwell has a note in 1533, \"for\r\n                   the establishing of a Council in the Marches of\r\n                   Wales\" (_L. and P._, vi., 386), and there had been\r\n                   numerous complaints in Parliament about their\r\n                   condition (_ibid._, vii., 781). Henry was a great\r\n                   Unionist, though Separatist as regards his wives\r\n                   and the Pope.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1014: See an admirable study by Miss\r\n                   C.A.J.

Cromwell's great constitutional idea\r\n                   was government by council rather than by\r\n                   Parliament; in 1534 he had a scheme for including\r\n                   in the King's Ordinary Council (not of course the\r\n                   Privy Council) \"the most assured and substantial\r\n                   gentlemen in every shire\" (_L. and P._, vii., 420;\r\n                   _cf._ his draft bill for a new court of\r\n                   conservators of the commonwealth and the more rigid\r\n                   execution of statutes, vii., 1611).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1015: _L. and P._, vii., 1554.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1016: _Cf._ Maitland, _English Law and\r\n                   the Renaissance_, p. 70; Lee to Cromwell: \"if we\r\n                   should do nothing but as the common law will, these\r\n                   things so far out of order will never be redressed\"\r\n                   (_D.N.B._, xxxii., 375; the letter is dated 18th\r\n                   July, 1538, by the _D.N.B._ and Maitland, but\r\n                   there is no letter of that date from Roland Lee in\r\n                   _L. and P._; probably the sentence occurs in Lee's\r\n                   letter of 18th July, 1534, or that of 18th July,\r\n                   1535 (_L. and P._, vii., 988, viii., 1058), though\r\n                   the phrase is not given in _L. and P._).]\r\n\r\nBut Ireland demanded even more than Wales the application of Henry's\r\ndoctrines of union and empire; for if Wales was thought by Chapuys to\r\nbe receptive soil for the seeds of rebellion, sedition across St.\r\nGeorge's Channel was ripe unto the harvest. Irish affairs, among other\r\ndomestic problems, had been sacrificed to Wolsey's passion for playing\r\na part in Europe, and on the eve of his fall English rule in Ireland\r\nwas reported to be weaker than it had been since the Conquest. The\r\noutbreak of war with Charles V., in 1528, was followed by the first\r\nappearance of Spanish emissaries at the courts of Irish chiefs, and\r\nfrom Spanish intrigue in Ireland Tudor monarchs were never again to be\r\nfree. In the autumn of 1534 the whole of Ireland outside the pale\r\nblazed up in revolt. Sir William Skeffington succeeded in crushing the\r\nrebellion; but Skeffington died in the following year, and his\r\nsuccessor, Lord Leonard Grey, failed to overcome the difficulties\r\ncaused by Irish disaffection and by jealousies in his council. His\r\nsister was wife of Fitzgerald, the Earl of Kildare, and the        (p. 367)\r\nrevolt of the Geraldines brought Grey himself under suspicion. He was\r\naccused by his council of treason; he returned to England in 1540,\r\ndeclaring the country at peace. But, before he had audience with\r\nHenry, a fresh insurrection broke out, and Grey was sent to the Tower;\r\nthence, having pleaded guilty to charges of treason, he trod the usual\r\npath to the block.\r\n\r\nHenry now adopted fresh methods; he determined to treat Ireland in\r\nmuch the same way as Wales. A commission, appointed in 1537, had made\r\na thorough survey of the land, and supplied him with the outlines of\r\nhis policy. As in Wales, the English system of land tenure, of justice\r\nand the English language were to supersede indigenous growths; the\r\nKing's supremacy in temporal and ecclesiastical affairs was to be\r\nenforced, and the whole of the land was to be gradually won by a\r\njudicious admixture of force and conciliation.[1017] The new deputy,\r\nSir Anthony St. Leger, was an able man, who had presided over the\r\ncommission of 1537. He landed at Dublin in 1541, and his work was\r\nthoroughly done. Henry, no longer so lavish with his money as in\r\nWolsey's days, did not stint for this purpose.[1018] The Irish\r\nParliament passed an act that Henry should be henceforth styled King,\r\ninstead of Lord, of Ireland; and many of the chiefs were induced to\r\nrelinquish their tribal independence in return for glittering\r\ncoronets. By 1542 Ireland had not merely peace within her own borders,\r\nbut was able to send two thousand kernes to assist the English on the\r\nborders of Scotland; and English rule in Ireland was more widely and\r\nmore firmly established than it had ever been before.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1017: See R. Dunlop in _Owens College\r\n                   Studies_, 1901, and the _Calendar of Carew MSS._\r\n                   and _Calendar of Irish State Papers_, vol. i.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1018: _L. and P._, xvi., 43, 77.]\r\n\r\nBesides Ireland and Wales, there were other spheres in which Henry (p. 368)\r\nsought to consolidate and extend the Tudor methods of government. The\r\nerection, in 1542, of the Courts of Wards and Liveries, of First-fruits\r\nand Tenths, and the development of the jurisdiction of the Star\r\nChamber and of the Court of Requests,[1019] were all designed to\r\nfurther two objects dear to Henry's heart, the efficiency of his\r\nadministration and the exaltation of his prerogative. It was\r\nthoroughly in keeping with his policy that the parliamentary system\r\nexpanded concurrently with the sphere of the King's activity. Berwick\r\nhad first been represented in the Parliament of 1529,[1020] and a\r\nstep, which would have led to momentous consequences, had the idea, on\r\nwhich it was based, been carried out, was taken in 1536, when two\r\nmembers were summoned from Calais. There was now only one district\r\nunder English rule which was not represented in Parliament, and that\r\nwas the county of Durham, known as _the_ bishopric, which still\r\nremained detached from the national system. It was left for Oliver\r\nCromwell to complete England's parliamentary representation by\r\nsummoning members to sit for that palatine county.[1021] This was not\r\nthe only respect in which the Commonwealth followed in the footsteps\r\nof Henry VIII., for the Parliament of 1542, in which members from\r\nWales and from Calais are first recorded as sitting,[1022] passed an\r\n\"Act for the Navy,\" which provided that goods could only be        (p. 369)\r\nimported in English ships. It was, however, in his dealings with\r\nScotland that Henry's schemes for the expansion of England became most\r\nmarked; but, before he could develop his plans in that direction, he\r\nhad to ward off a recrudescence of the danger from a coalition of\r\nCatholic Europe.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1019: _L. and P._, xvi., 28; _cf._\r\n                   Leadam, _Court of Requests_, Selden Soc., Introd.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1020: _Official Return of Members of\r\n                   Parliament_, i., 369.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1021: See G.T. Lapsley, _The County\r\n                   Palatine of Durham_, in _Harvard Historical\r\n                   Series_.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1022: There are no records in the\r\n                   _Official Return_ for 1536 and 1539, but Calais had\r\n                   been granted Parliamentary representation by an Act\r\n                   of the previous Parliament (27 Hen. VIII., Private\r\n                   Acts, No. 9; _cf. L. and P._, x., 1086).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn spite of Henry's efforts to fan the flames of strife[1023] between\r\nthe Emperor and the King of France, the war, which had prevented\r\neither monarch from countenancing the mission of Cardinal Pole or from\r\nprofiting by the Pilgrimage of Grace, was gradually dying down in the\r\nautumn of 1537; and, in order to check the growing and dangerous\r\nintimacy between the two rivals, Henry was secretly hinting to both\r\nthat the death of his Queen had left him free to contract a marriage\r\nwhich might bind him for ever to one or the other.[1024] To Francis he\r\nsent a request for the hand of Mary of Guise, who had already been\r\npromised to James V. of Scotland. He refused to believe that the Scots\r\nnegotiations had proceeded so far that they could not be set aside for\r\nso great a king as himself, and he succeeded in convincing the lady's\r\nrelatives that the position of a Queen of England provided greater\r\nattractions than any James could hold out.[1025] Francis, however,\r\ntook matters into his own hands, and compelled the Guises to fulfil\r\ntheir compact with the Scottish King. Nothing daunted, Henry asked for\r\na list of other French ladies eligible for the matrimonial prize.  (p. 370)\r\nHe even suggested that the handsomest of them might be sent, in the\r\ntrain of Margaret of Navarre, to Calais, where he could inspect them\r\nin person.[1026] \"I trust to no one,\" he told Castillon, the French\r\nambassador, \"but myself. The thing touches me too near. I wish to see\r\nthem and know them some time before deciding.\"[1027] This idea of\r\n\"trotting out the young ladies like hackneys\"[1028] was not much\r\nrelished at the French Court; and Castillon, to shame Henry out of the\r\nindelicacy of his proposal, made an ironical suggestion for testing\r\nthe ladies' charms, the grossness of which brought the only recorded\r\nblush to Henry's cheeks.[1029] No more was said of the beauty-show;\r\nand Henry declared that he did not intend to marry in France or in\r\nSpain at all, unless his marriage brought him a closer alliance with\r\nFrancis or Charles than the rivals had formed with each other.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1023: Vols. xii. and xiii. of the _L. and\r\n                   P._ are full of these attempts.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1024: For the negotiations with France\r\n                   from 1537 onwards see Kaulek, _Corresp. de MM.\r\n                   Castillon et Marillac_, Paris, 1885.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1025: _L. and P._, XIII., i., 165, 273.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1026: Is this another trace of\r\n                   \"Byzantinism\"?

She was daughter of the deposed King of Denmark and\r\nof his wife, Isabella, sister of Charles V.; at the age of thirteen\r\nshe had been married to the Duke of Milan, but she was now a       (p. 371)\r\nvirgin widow of sixteen, \"very tall and competent of beauty, of favour\r\nexcellent and very gentle in countenance\".[1031] On 10th March, 1538,\r\nHolbein arrived at Brussels for the purpose of painting the lady's\r\nportrait, which he finished in a three hours' sitting.[1032]\r\nChristina's fascinations do not seem to have made much impression on\r\nHenry; indeed, his taste in feminine beauty cannot be commended. There\r\nis no good authority for the alleged reply of the young duchess\r\nherself, that, if she had two heads, she would willingly place one of\r\nthem at His Majesty's disposal.[1033] Henry had, as yet, beheaded only\r\none of his wives, and even if the precedent had been more firmly\r\nestablished, Christina was too wary and too polite to refer to it in\r\nsuch uncourtly terms. She knew that the disposal of her hand did not\r\nrest with herself, and though the Emperor sent powers for the\r\nconclusion of the match, neither he nor Henry had any desire to see it\r\nconcluded. The cementing of his friendship with Francis freed Charles\r\nfrom the need of Henry's goodwill, and impelled the English King to\r\nseek elsewhere for means to counter-balance the hostile alliance.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1030: _Ibid._, XII., ii., 1172.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1031: _L. and P._, XII., ii., Pref. p.\r\n                   xxviii., No. 1187.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1032: _Ibid._, XIII., i., 380, 507.

Charles, Francis, and Paul III. met at Nice in June,\r\n1538, and there the Pope negotiated a ten years' truce. Henceforth\r\nthey were to consider their interests identical, and their ambassadors\r\nin England compared notes in order to defeat more effectively Henry's\r\nskilful diplomacy.[1034] The moment seemed ripe for the execution of\r\nthe long-cherished project for a descent upon England. Its King had\r\njust added to his long list of offences against the Church by despoiling\r\nthe shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury and burning the bones of the\r\nsaint. The saint was even said to have been put on his trial in\r\nmockery, declared contumacious, and condemned as a traitor.[1035] If\r\nthe canonised bones of martyrs could be treated thus, who would, for\r\nthe future, pay respect to the Church or tribute at its shrines? At\r\nRome a party, of which Pole was the most zealous, proclaimed that the\r\nreal Turk was Henry, and that all Christian princes should unite to\r\nsweep him from the face of God's earth, which his presence had too\r\nlong defiled. Considering the effect of Christian leagues against the\r\nOttoman, the English Turk was probably not dismayed. But Paul III. and\r\nPole were determined to do their worst. The Pope resolved to publish\r\nthe bull of deprivation, which had been drawn up in August, 1535,\r\nthough its execution had hitherto been suspended owing to papal    (p. 373)\r\nhopes of Henry's amendment and to the request of various princes. Now\r\nthe bull was to be published in France, in Flanders, in Scotland and\r\nin Ireland. Beton was made a cardinal and sent home to exhort James V.\r\nto invade his uncle's kingdom,[1036] while Pole again set out on his\r\ntravels to promote the conquest of his native land.[1037]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1034: _L. and P._, XIII., ii., 232, 277,\r\n                   914, 915.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1035: The burning of the bones is stated\r\n                   as a fact in the Papal Bull of December, 1538 (_L.\r\n                   and P._, XIII., ii., 1087; see Pref., p. xvi., n.);\r\n                   but the documents printed in Wilkins's _Concilia_,\r\n                   iii., 835, giving an account of an alleged trial of\r\n                   the body of St. Thomas are forgeries (_L. and P._,\r\n                   XIII., ii., pp. xli., xlii., 49). A precedent might\r\n                   have been found in Pope Stephen VI.'s treatment of\r\n                   his predecessor, Formosus (_Hist. Generale_, i.,\r\n                   536).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1036: _L. and P._, XIII., ii., 1108-9,\r\n                   1114-16, 1130, 1135-36.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1037: _Ibid._, XIII., ii., 950, 1110.]\r\n\r\nIt was on Pole's unfortunate relatives that the effects of the threatened\r\nbull were to fall. Besides the Cardinal's treason, there was another\r\nmotive for proscribing his family. He and his brothers were grandchildren\r\nof George, Duke of Clarence; years before, Chapuys had urged Charles\r\nV. to put forward Pole as a candidate for the throne; and Henry was as\r\nconvinced as his father had been that the real way to render his\r\nGovernment secure was to put away all the possible alternatives. Now\r\nthat he was threatened with deprivation by papal sentence, the need\r\nbecame more urgent than ever. But, while the proscription of the Poles\r\nwas undoubtedly dictated by political reasons, their conduct enabled\r\nHenry to effect it by legal means. There was no doubt of the\r\nCardinal's treason; his brother, Sir Geoffrey, had often taken counsel\r\nwith Charles's ambassador, and discussed plans for the invasion of\r\nEngland;[1038] and even their mother, the aged Countess of Salisbury,\r\nalthough she had denounced the Cardinal as a traitor and had lamented\r\nthe fact that she had given him birth, had brought herself within the\r\ntoils by receiving papal bulls and corresponding with traitors.[1039]\r\nThe least guilty of the family appears to have been the Countess's\r\neldest son, Lord Montague;[1040] but he, too, was involved in      (p. 374)\r\nthe common ruin. Plots were hatched for kidnapping the Cardinal and\r\nbringing him home to stand his trial for treason. Sir Geoffrey was\r\narrested in August, 1538, was induced, or forced, to turn King's\r\nevidence, and as a reward was granted his miserable, conscience-struck\r\nlife.[1041] The Countess was spared for a while, but Montague mounted\r\nthe scaffold in December.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1038: _Ibid._, vii., 1368; viii., 750.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1039: _Ibid._, XIII., ii., 835, 838,\r\n                   855.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1040: He had, however, been sending\r\n                   information to Chapuys as early as 1534 (_L. and\r\n                   P._, vii., 957), when Charles V. was urged to make\r\n                   use of him and of Reginald Pole (_ibid._, vii.,\r\n                   1040; _cf. ibid._, XIII., ii., 702, 830, 954).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1041: _Ibid._, XIII., pt. ii., _passim_.\r\n                   He attempted to commit suicide (_ibid._, 703).]\r\n\r\nWith Montague perished his cousin, the Marquis of Exeter, whose\r\ndescent from Edward IV. was as fatal to him as their descent from\r\nClarence was to the Poles. The Marquis was the White Rose, the next\r\nheir to the throne if the line of the Tudors failed. His father, the\r\nEarl of Devonshire, had been attainted in the reign of Henry VII.; but\r\nHenry VIII. had reversed the attainder, had treated the young Earl\r\nwith kindness, had made him Knight of the Garter and Marquis of\r\nExeter, and had sought in various ways to win his support. But his\r\ndynastic position and dislike of Henry's policy drove the Marquis into\r\nthe ranks of the discontented. He had been put in the Tower, in 1531,\r\non suspicion of treason; after his release he listened to the\r\nhysterics of Elizabeth Barton, intrigued with Chapuys, and corresponded\r\nwith Reginald Pole;[1042] and in Cornwall, in 1538, men conspired to\r\nmake him King.[1043] Less evidence than this would have            (p. 375)\r\nconvinced a jury of peers in Tudor times of the expediency of Exeter's\r\ndeath; and, on the 9th of December, his head paid the price of his\r\nroyal descent.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1042: _Ibid._, v., 416; vi., 1419, 1464.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1043: _Ibid._, XIII., ii., 802, 961.]\r\n\r\nThese executions do not seem to have produced the faintest symptoms of\r\ndisgust in the popular mind. The threat of invasion evoked a national\r\nenthusiasm for defence. In August, 1538, Henry went down to inspect\r\nthe fortifications he had been for years erecting at Dover; masonry\r\nfrom the demolished monasteries was employed in dotting the coast with\r\ncastles, such as Calshot and Hurst, which were built with materials\r\nfrom the neighbouring abbey of Beaulieu. Commissioners were sent to\r\nrepair the defences at Calais and Guisnes, on the Scottish Borders,\r\nalong the coasts from Berwick to the mouth of the Thames, and from the\r\nThames to Lizard Point.[1044] Beacons were repaired, ordnance was\r\nsupplied wherever it was needed, lists of ships and of mariners were\r\ndrawn up in every port, and musters were taken throughout the kingdom.\r\nEverywhere the people pressed forward to help; in the Isle of Wight\r\nthey were lining the shores with palisades, and taking every\r\nprecaution to render a landing of the enemy a perilous enterprise.[1045]\r\nIn Essex they anticipated the coming of the commissioners by digging\r\ndykes and throwing up ramparts; at Harwich the Lord Chancellor saw\r\n\"women and children working with shovels at the trenches and bulwarks\".\r\nWhatever we may think of the roughness and rigour of Henry's rule, his\r\nmethods were not resented by the mass of his people. He had not lost\r\nhis hold on the nation; whenever he appealed to his subjects in a time\r\nof national danger, he met with an eager response; and, had the    (p. 376)\r\nschemers abroad, who idly dreamt of his expulsion from the throne,\r\nsucceeded in composing their mutual quarrels and launching their bolt\r\nagainst England, there is no reason to suppose that its fate would\r\nhave differed from that of the Spanish Armada.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1044: _L. and P._, XIV., i., 478, 533,\r\n                   630, 671, 762, 899.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1045: _Ibid._, XIV., i., 540, 564, 573,\r\n                   615, 655, 682, 711, 712.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fears of invasion which prevailed in the spring of\r\n1539, Pole's second mission had no more success than the first;[1046]\r\nand the hostile fleet, for the sight of which the Warden of the Cinque\r\nPorts was straining his eyes from Dover Castle, never came from the\r\nmouths of the Scheldt and the Rhine; or rather, the supposed Armada\r\nproved to be a harmless convoy of traders.[1047] The Pope himself, on\r\nsecond thoughts, withheld his promised bull. He distrusted its\r\nreception at the hands of his secular allies, and dreaded the contempt\r\nand ridicule which would follow an open failure.[1048] Moreover, at\r\nthe height of his fervour against Henry, he could not refrain from\r\nattempts to extend his temporal power, and his seizure of Urbino\r\nalienated Francis and afforded Henry some prospect of creating an\r\nanti-papal party in Italy.[1049] Francis would gladly join in a\r\nprohibition of English commerce, if Charles would only begin; but\r\nwithout Charles he could do nothing, and, even when his amity with the\r\nEmperor was closest, he was compelled, at Henry's demand, to punish\r\nthe French priests who inveighed against English enormities.[1050] To\r\nCharles, however, English trade was worth more than to Francis,    (p. 377)\r\nand the Emperor's subjects would tolerate no interruption of their\r\nlucrative intercourse with England. With the consummate skill which he\r\nalmost invariably displayed in political matters, Henry had, in 1539,\r\nwhen the danger seemed greatest, provided the Flemings with an\r\nadditional motive for peace. He issued a proclamation that, for seven\r\nyears, their goods should pay no more duty than those of the English\r\nthemselves;[1051] and the thrifty Dutch were little inclined to stop,\r\nby a war, the fresh stream of gold. The Emperor, too, had more urgent\r\nmatters in hand. Henry might be more of a Turk than the Sultan\r\nhimself, and the Pope might regard the sack of St. Thomas's shrine\r\nwith more horror than the Turkish defeat of a Christian fleet; but\r\nHenry was not harrying the Emperor's coasts, nor threatening to\r\ndeprive the Emperor's brother of his Hungarian kingdom; and Turkish\r\nvictories on land and on sea gave the imperial family much more\r\nconcern than all Henry's onslaughts on the saints and their relics.\r\nAnd, besides the Ottoman peril, Charles had reason to fear the\r\npolitical effects of the union between England and the Protestant\r\nprinces of Germany, for which the religious development in England was\r\npaving the way, and which an attack on Henry would at once have\r\ncemented.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1046: _L. and P._, XIV., i., Introd., pp.\r\n                   xi.-xiii.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1047: _Ibid._, XIV., i., 714, 728, 741,\r\n                   767.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1048: _Cf. ibid._, XIV., i., 1011, 1013;\r\n                   ii., 99.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1049: _Ibid._, XIV., i., 27, 37, 92, 98,\r\n                   104, 114, 144, 188, 235, 884; ii., 357.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1050: _L. and P._, XIV., i., 37, 92,\r\n                   371.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1051: _L. and P._, XIV., i., 373.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe powers conferred upon Henry as Supreme Head of the Church were not\r\nlong suffered to remain in abeyance. Whatever the theory may have\r\nbeen, in practice Henry's supremacy over the Church was very different\r\nfrom that which Kings of England had hitherto wielded; and from the\r\nmoment he entered upon his new ecclesiastical kingdom, he set      (p. 378)\r\nhimself not merely to reform practical abuses, such as the excessive\r\nwealth of the clergy, but to define the standard of orthodox faith,\r\nand to force his subjects to embrace the royal theology. The Catholic\r\nfaith was to hold good only so far as the Supreme Head willed; the\r\n\"King's doctrine\" became the rule to which \"_our_ Church of England,\"\r\nas Henry styled it, was henceforth to conform; and \"unity and concord\r\nin opinion\" were to be established by royal decree.\r\n\r\nThe first royal definition of the faith was embodied in ten articles\r\nsubmitted to Convocation in 1536. The King was, he said, constrained\r\nby diversity of opinions \"to put his own pen to the book and conceive\r\ncertain articles... thinking that no person, having authority from\r\nhim, would presume to say a word against their meaning, or be remiss\r\nin setting them forth\".[1052] His people, he maintained, whether peer\r\nor prelate, had no right to resist his temporal or spiritual commands,\r\nwhatever they might be. Episcopal authority had indeed sunk low. When\r\nConvocation was opened, in 1536, a layman, Dr. William Petre,\r\nappeared, and demanded the place of honour above all bishops and\r\narchbishops in their assembly. Pre-eminence belonged, he said, to the\r\nKing as Supreme Head of the Church; the King had appointed Cromwell\r\nhis Vicar-general; and Cromwell had named him, Petre, his\r\nproctor.[1053] The claim was allowed, and the submissive clergy found\r\nlittle fault with the royal articles of faith, though they mentioned\r\nonly three sacraments, baptism, penance and the sacrament of the\r\naltar, denounced the abuse of images, warned men against excessive (p. 379)\r\ndevotion to the saints, and against believing that \"ceremonies have\r\npower to remit sin,\" or that masses can deliver souls from purgatory.\r\nFinally, Convocation transferred from the Pope to the Christian\r\nprinces the right to summon a General Council.[1054]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1052: _L. and P._, xi., 1110; _cf.\r\n                   ibid._, 59, 123, 377, 954.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1053: Wilkins, _Concilia_, iii., 803.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1054: Fuller, _Church History_, ed. 1845,\r\n                   iii., 145-59; Burnet, _Reformation_, ed. Pocock,\r\n                   iv., 272-90; Strype, _Cranmer_, i., 58-62.]\r\n\r\nWith the _Institution of a Christian Man_, issued in the following\r\nyear, and commonly called _The Bishops' Book_, Henry had little to do.\r\nThe bishops debated the doctrinal questions from February to July,\r\n1537, but the King wrote, in August, that he had had no time to\r\nexamine their conclusions.[1055] He trusted, however, to their wisdom,\r\nand agreed that the book should be published and read to the people on\r\nSundays and holy-days for three years to come. In the same year he\r\npermitted a change, which inevitably gave fresh impulse to the\r\nreforming movement in England and destroyed every prospect of that\r\n\"union and concord in opinions,\" on which he set so much store. Miles\r\nCoverdale was licensed to print an edition of his Bible in England,\r\nwith a dedication to Queen Jane Seymour; and, in 1538, a second\r\nEnglish version was prepared by John Rogers, under Cranmer's\r\nauthority, and published as Matthew's Bible.[1056] This was the Bible\r\n\"of the largest volume\" which Cromwell, as Henry's Vicegerent, ordered\r\nto be set up in all churches. Every incumbent was to encourage his\r\nparishioners to read it; he was to recite the Paternoster, the Creed\r\nand the Ten Commandments in English, that his flock might learn    (p. 380)\r\nthem by degrees; he was to require some acquaintance with the\r\nrudiments of the faith, as a necessary condition from all before they\r\ncould receive the Sacrament of the Altar; he was to preach at least\r\nonce a quarter; and to institute a register of births, marriages and\r\ndeaths.[1057]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1055: _L. and P._, XII., ii., 618;\r\n                   Cranmer, _Works_, ii., 469; _cf._ Jenkyns,\r\n                   _Cranmer_, ii., 21; and Cranmer, _Works_, ii., 83,\r\n                   359, 360.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1056: See the present writer's _Cranmer_,\r\n                   pp. 110-13; Dixon, _Church History_, ii., 77-79.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1057: See these _injunctions_ in Burnet,\r\n                   iv., 341-46; Wilkins, _Concilia,_ iii., 815.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a vigorous assault was made on the strongholds of\r\nsuperstition; pilgrimages were suppressed, and many wonder-working\r\nimages were pulled down and destroyed. The famous Rood of Boxley, a\r\nfigure whose contortions had once imposed on the people, was taken to\r\nthe market-place at Maidstone,[1058] and the ingenious mechanism,\r\nwhereby the eyes and lips miraculously opened and shut, was exhibited\r\nto the vulgar gaze.[1059] Probably these little devices had already\r\nsunk in popular esteem, for the Blood of St. Januarius could not be\r\ntreated at Naples to-day in the same cavalier fashion as the Blood of\r\nHailes was in England in 1538,[1060] without a riot. But the exposure\r\nwas a useful method of exciting popular indignation against the monks,\r\nand it filled reformers with a holy joy. \"Dagon,\" wrote one to\r\nBullinger, \"is everywhere falling in England. Bel of Babylon has been\r\nbroken to pieces.\"[1061] The destruction of the images was a preliminary\r\nskirmish in the final campaign against the monks. The Act of 1536  (p. 381)\r\nhad only granted to the King religious houses which possessed an\r\nendowment of less than two hundred pounds a year; the dissolution of\r\nthe greater monasteries was now gradually effected by a process of\r\nmore or less voluntary surrender. In some cases the monks may have\r\nbeen willing enough to go; they were loaded with debt, and harassed by\r\nrules imposed by Cromwell, which would have been difficult to keep in\r\nthe palmiest days of monastic enthusiasm; and they may well have\r\nthought that freedom from monastic restraint, coupled with a pension,\r\nwas a welcome relief, especially when resistance involved the anger of\r\nthe prince and liability to the penalties of elastic treasons and of a\r\n_praemunire_ which no one could understand. So, one after another, the\r\ngreat abbeys yielded to the persuasions and threats of the royal\r\ncommissioners. The dissolution of the Mendicant Orders and of the\r\nKnights of St. John dispersed the last remnants of the papal army as\r\nan organised force in England, though warfare of a kind continued for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1058: _L. and P._, XIII., i., 231, 348.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1059: Father Bridgett in his _Blunders\r\n                   and Forgeries_ repudiates the idea that these\r\n                   \"innocent toys\" had been put to any superstitious\r\n                   uses.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1060: _L. and P._, XIII., i., 347, 564,\r\n                   580; ii., 186, 409, 488, 709, 710, 856.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1061: John Hoker of Maidstone to\r\n                   Bullinger in Burnet (ed. Pocock, vi., 194, 195).]\r\n\r\nThese proceedings created as much satisfaction among the Lutherans of\r\nGermany as they did disgust at Rome, and an alliance between Henry and\r\nthe Protestant princes seemed to be dictated by a community of religious,\r\nas well as of political, interests. The friendship between Francis and\r\nCharles threatened both English and German liberties, and it behoved\r\nthe two countries to combine against their common foe. Henry's manifesto\r\nagainst the authority of the Pope to summon a General Council had been\r\nreceived with rapture in Germany; at least three German editions were\r\nprinted, and the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse urged on\r\nhim the adoption of a common policy.[1062] English envoys were     (p. 382)\r\nsent to Germany with this purpose in the spring of 1538, and German\r\ndivines journeyed to England to lay the foundation of a theological\r\nunion.[1063] They remained five months, but failed to effect an\r\nagreement.[1064] To the three points on which they desired further\r\nreform in England, the Communion in both kinds, the abolition of\r\nprivate masses and of the enforced celibacy of the clergy, Henry\r\nhimself wrote a long reply,[1065] maintaining in each case the\r\nCatholic faith. But the conference showed that Henry was for the time\r\nanxious to be conciliatory in religious matters, while from a political\r\npoint of view the need for an alliance grew more urgent than ever. All\r\nHenry's efforts to break the amity between Francis and Charles had\r\nfailed; his proposals of marriage to imperial and French princesses\r\nhad come to nothing; and, in the spring of 1539, it was rumoured that\r\nthe Emperor would further demonstrate the indissolubility of his\r\nintimacy with the French King by passing through France from Spain to\r\nGermany, instead of going, as he had always hitherto done, by sea, or\r\nthrough Italy and Austria. Cromwell seized the opportunity and\r\npersuaded Henry to strengthen his union with the Protestant princes by\r\nseeking a wife from a German house.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1062: Gairdner, _Church History_, p. 195;\r\n                   _L. and P._, XII., i., 1310; ii. 1088-89.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1063: _L. and P._, XIII., i., 352, 353,\r\n                   367, 645, 648-50, 1102, 1166, 1295, 1305, 1437.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1064: _Ibid._, XIII., ii., 741; Cranmer,\r\n                   _Works_, ii., 397; Burnet, i., 408; Strype, _Eccl.\r\n                   Mem._, i., App. Nos. 94-102.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1065: Burnet, iv., 373.]\r\n\r\nThis policy once adopted, the task of selecting a bride was easy. As\r\nearly as 1530[1066] the old Duke of Cleves had suggested some      (p. 383)\r\nmarriage alliance between his own and the royal family of England. He\r\nwas closely allied to the Elector of Saxony, who had married Sibylla,\r\nthe Duke of Cleves' daughter; and the young Duke, who was soon to\r\nsucceed his father, had also claims to the Duchy of Guelders. Guelders\r\nwas a thorn in the side of the Emperor; it stood to the Netherlands in\r\nmuch the same relation as Scotland stood to England, and when there\r\nwas war between Charles and Francis Guelders had always been one of\r\nthe most useful pawns in the French King's hands. Hence an alliance\r\nbetween the German princes, the King of Denmark, who had joined their\r\npolitical and religious union, Guelders and England would have\r\nseriously threatened the Emperor's hold on his Dutch dominions.[1067]\r\nThis was the step which Henry was induced to take, when he realised\r\nthat Charles's friendship with France remained unbroken, and that the\r\nEmperor had made up his mind to visit Paris. Hints of a marriage\r\nbetween Henry and Anne of Cleves[1068] were thrown out early in 1539;\r\nthe only difficulty, which subsequently proved very convenient, was\r\nthat the lady had been promised to the son of the Duke of          (p. 384)\r\nLorraine. The objection was waived on the ground that Anne herself had\r\nnot given her consent; in view of the advantages of the match and of\r\nthe Duke's financial straits, Henry agreed to forgo a dowry; and, on\r\nthe 6th of October, the treaty of marriage was signed.[1069]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1066: _L. and P._, iv., 6364.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1067: See the present writer in\r\n                   _Cambridge Modern History_, ii., 236, 237. The Duke\r\n                   of Cleves was not a Lutheran or a Protestant, as is\r\n                   generally assumed. He had established a curious\r\n                   Erasmian compromise between Protestantism and Roman\r\n                   Catholicism, which bears some resemblance to the\r\n                   ecclesiastical policy pursued by Henry VIII., and\r\n                   by the Elector Joachim II. of Brandenburg; and the\r\n                   marriage of Anne with Henry did not imply so great\r\n                   a change in ecclesiastical policy as has usually\r\n                   been supposed. The objections to it were really\r\n                   more political than religious; the Schmalkaldic\r\n                   League was a feeble reed to lean upon, although its\r\n                   feebleness was not exposed until 1546-47.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1068: _L. and P._, XIV., i., 103; _cf._\r\n                   Bouterwek, _Anna von Cleve_; Merriman, _Cromwell_,\r\n                   chap. xiii.; and articles on the members of the\r\n                   Cleves family in the _Allgemeine Deutsche\r\n                   Biographie_.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1069: _L. and P._, XIV., ii., 285, 286.]\r\n\r\nAnne of Cleves had already been described to Henry by his ambassador,\r\nDr. Wotton, and Holbein had been sent to paint her portrait (now in\r\nthe Louvre), which Wotton pronounced \"a very lively image\".[1070] She\r\nhad an oval face, long nose, chestnut eyes, a light complexion, and\r\nvery pale lips. She was thirty-four years old, and in France was\r\nreported to be ugly; but Cromwell told the King that \"every one\r\npraised her beauty, both of face and body, and one said she excelled\r\nthe Duchess of Milan as the golden sun did the silver moon\".[1071]\r\nWotton's account of her accomplishments was pitched in a minor key.\r\nHer gentleness was universally commended, but she spent her time\r\nchiefly in needlework. She knew no language but her own; she could\r\nneither sing nor play upon any instrument, accomplishments which were\r\nthen considered by Germans to be unbecoming in a lady.[1072] On the\r\n12th of December, 1539, she arrived at Calais; but boisterous weather\r\nand bad tides delayed her there till the 27th. She landed at Deal  (p. 385)\r\nand rode to Canterbury. On the 30th she proceeded to Sittingbourne,\r\nand thence, on the 31st, to Rochester, where the King met her in\r\ndisguise.[1073] If he was disappointed with her appearance, he\r\nconcealed the fact from the public eye. Nothing marred her public\r\nreception at Greenwich on the 3rd, or was suffered to hinder the\r\nwedding, which was solemnised three days later.[1074] Henry \"lovingly\r\nembraced and kissed\" his bride in public, and allowed no hint to reach\r\nthe ears of any one but his most intimate counsellors of the fact that\r\nhe had been led willingly or unwillingly into the most humiliating\r\nsituation of his reign.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1070: _Ibid._, XIV., ii., 33. Holbein did\r\n                   not paint a flattering portrait any more than\r\n                   Wotton told a flattering tale; if Henry was\r\n                   deceived in the matter it was by Cromwell's\r\n                   unfortunate assurances. As a matter of fact Anne\r\n                   was at least as good looking as Jane Seymour, and\r\n                   Henry's taste in the matter of feminine beauty was\r\n                   not of a very high order. Bishop Stubbs even\r\n                   suggests that their appearance was \"if not a\r\n                   justification, at least a colourable reason for\r\n                   understanding the readiness with which he put them\r\n                   away\" (_Lectures_, 1887, p. 284).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1071: _L. and P._, XIV., i., 552.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1072: _Ibid._, XIV., ii., 33.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1073: _L. and P._, XIV., ii., 664, 674,\r\n                   677, 726, 732, 753, 754, 769.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1074: Hall, _Chronicle_, p. 836.]\r\n\r\nSuch was, in reality, the result of his failure to act on the\r\nprinciple laid down by himself to the French ambassador two years\r\nbefore. He had then declared that the choice of a wife was too\r\ndelicate a matter to be left to a deputy, and that he must see and\r\nknow a lady some time before he made up his mind to marry her. Anne of\r\nCleves had been selected by Cromwell, and the lady, whose beauty was,\r\naccording to Cromwell, in every one's mouth, seemed to Henry no better\r\nthan \"a Flanders mare\".[1075] The day after the interview at Rochester\r\nhe told Cromwell that Anne was \"nothing so well as she was spoken of,\"\r\nand that, \"if he had known before as much as he knew then, she should\r\nnot have come within his realm\". He demanded of his Vicegerent what\r\nremedy he had to suggest, and Cromwell had none. Next day Cranmer,\r\nNorfolk, Suffolk, Southampton and Tunstall were called in with     (p. 386)\r\nno better result. \"Is there none other remedy,\" repeated Henry, \"but\r\nthat I must needs, against my will, put my neck in the yoke?\"[1076]\r\nApparently there was none. The Emperor was being feted in Paris; to\r\nrepudiate the marriage would throw the Duke of Cleves into the arms of\r\nthe allied sovereigns, alienate the German princes, and leave Henry\r\nwithout a friend among the powers of Christendom. So he made up his\r\nmind to put his neck in the yoke and to marry \"the Flanders mare\".\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1075: Burnet, i., 434. The phrase appears\r\n                   to have no extant contemporary authority, but\r\n                   Burnet is not, as a rule, imaginative, and many\r\n                   records have been destroyed since he wrote.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1076: Cromwell to Henry VIII., in\r\n                   Merriman, ii., 268-72.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHenry, however, was never patient of matrimonial or other yokes, and\r\nit was quite certain that, as soon as he could do so without serious\r\nrisk, he would repudiate his unattractive wife, and probably other\r\nthings besides. For Anne's defects were only the last straw added to\r\nthe burden which Henry bore. He had not only been forced by\r\ncircumstances into marriage with a wife who was repugnant to him, but\r\ninto a religious and secular policy which he and the mass of his\r\nsubjects disliked. The alliance with the Protestant princes might be a\r\nuseful weapon if things came to the worst, and if there were a joint\r\nattack on England by Francis and Charles; but, on its merits, it was\r\nnot to be compared to a good understanding with the Emperor; and Henry\r\nwould have no hesitation in throwing over the German princes when once\r\nhe saw his way to a renewal of friendship with Charles. He would\r\nwelcome, even more, a relief from the necessity of paying attention to\r\nGerman divines. He had never wavered in his adhesion to the cardinal\r\npoints of the Catholic faith. He had no enmity to Catholicism, provided\r\nit did not stand in his way. The spiritual jurisdiction of Rome    (p. 387)\r\nhad been abolished in England because it imposed limits on Henry's own\r\nauthority. Some of the powers of the English clergy had been destroyed,\r\npartly for a similar reason, and partly as a concession to the laity.\r\nBut the purely spiritual claims of the Church remained unimpaired; the\r\nclergy were still a caste, separate from other men, and divinely\r\nendowed with the power of performing a daily miracle in the conversion\r\nof the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. Even\r\nwhen the Protestant alliance seemed most indispensable, Henry\r\nendeavoured to convince Lutherans of the truth of the Catholic\r\ndoctrine of the mass, and could not refrain from persecuting heretics\r\nwith a zeal that shook the confidence of his reforming allies. His\r\nhonour, he thought, was involved in his success in proving that he,\r\nwith his royal supremacy, could defend the faith more effectively than\r\nthe Pope, with all his pretended powers; and he took a personal\r\ninterest in the conversion and burning of heretics. Several instances\r\nare recorded of his arguing a whole day with Sacramentaries,[1077]\r\nexercises which exhibited to advantage at once the royal authority and\r\nthe royal learning in spiritual matters. His beliefs were not due to\r\ncaprice or to ignorance; probably no bishop in his realm was more\r\ndeeply read in heterodox theology.[1078] He was constantly on the  (p. 388)\r\nlook-out for books by Luther and other heresiarchs, and he kept quite\r\na respectable theological library at hand for private use. The\r\ntenacity with which he clung to orthodox creeds and Catholic forms was\r\nnot only strengthened by study but rooted in the depths of his\r\ncharacter. To devout but fundamentally irreligious men, like Henry\r\nVIII. and Louis XIV., rites and ceremonies are a great consolation;\r\nand Henry seldom neglected to creep to the Cross on Good Friday, to\r\nserve the priest at mass, to receive holy bread and holy water every\r\nSunday, and daily to use \"all other laudable ceremonies\".[1079]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1077: _E.g._, _L. and P._, v., 285;\r\n                   XIII., ii., 849, Introd., p. xxviii. Sir John\r\n                   Wallop admired the \"charitable dexterity\" with\r\n                   which Henry treated them (_ibid._, xv., 429).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1078: When a book was presented to him\r\n                   which he had not the patience to read he handed it\r\n                   over to one of his lords-in-waiting to read; he\r\n                   then took it back and gave it to be examined to\r\n                   some one of an entirely different way of thinking,\r\n                   and made the two discuss its merits, and upon that\r\n                   discussion formed his own opinion (Cranmer to\r\n                   Wolfgang Capito, _Works_, ii., 341; the King, says\r\n                   Cranmer, \"is a most acute and vigilant observer\").\r\n                   Henry was also, according to modern standards,\r\n                   extraordinarily patient of theological discourses;\r\n                   when Cranmer obtained for Latimer an appointment to\r\n                   preach at Court, he advised him not to preach more\r\n                   than an hour or an hour and a half lest the King\r\n                   and Queen should grow weary! (_L. and P._, vii.,\r\n                   29).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1079: _L. and P._, XIV., i., 967, an\r\n                   interesting letter which also records how the King\r\n                   rowed up and down the Thames in his barge for an\r\n                   hour after evensong on Holy Thursday \"with his\r\n                   drums and fifes playing\".]\r\n\r\nWith such feelings at heart, a union with Protestants could never for\r\nHenry be more than a _mariage de convenance_; and in this, as in other\r\nthings, he carried with him the bulk of popular sympathy. In 1539 it\r\nwas said that no man in London durst speak against Catholic usages,\r\nand, in Lent of that year, a man was hanged, apparently at the\r\ninstance of the Recorder of London, for eating flesh on a Friday.[1080]\r\nThe attack on the Church had been limited to its privileges and to its\r\nproperty; its doctrine had scarcely been touched. The upper classes\r\namong the laity had been gorged with monastic spoils; they were\r\ndisposed to rest and be thankful. The middle classes had been      (p. 389)\r\nsatisfied to some extent by the restriction of clerical fees, and by\r\nthe prohibition of the clergy from competing with laymen in profitable\r\ntrades, such as brewing, tanning, and speculating in land and houses.\r\nThere was also the general reaction which always follows a period of\r\nchange. How far that reaction had gone, Henry first learnt from the\r\nParliament which met on the 28th of April, 1539.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1080: _Ibid._, i., 967. This had been\r\n                   made a capital offence as early as the days of\r\n                   Charlemagne (Gibbon, ed. 1890, iii., 450 n.).]\r\n\r\nThe elections were characterised by more court interference than is\r\ntraceable at any other period during the reign, though even on this\r\noccasion the evidence is fragmentary and affects comparatively few\r\nconstituencies.[1081] It was, moreover, Cromwell and not the King who\r\nsought to pack the House of Commons in favour of his own particular\r\npolicy; and the attempt produced discontent in various constituencies\r\nand a riot in one at least.[1082] The Earl of Southampton was      (p. 390)\r\nrequired to use his influence on behalf of Cromwell's nominees at\r\nFarnham, although that borough was within the Bishop of Winchester's\r\npreserves.[1083] So, too, Cromwell's henchman, Wriothesley, was\r\nreturned for the county of Southampton in spite of Gardiner's\r\nopposition. Never, till the days of the Stuarts, was there a more\r\nstriking instance of the futility of these tactics; for the House of\r\nCommons, which Cromwell took so much pains to secure, passed, without\r\na dissentient, the Bill of Attainder against him; and before it was\r\ndissolved, the bishop, against whose influence Cromwell had especially\r\nexerted himself, had taken Cromwell's place in the royal favour. There\r\nwas, indeed, no possibility of stemming the tide which was flowing\r\nagainst the Vicegerent and in favour of the King; and Cromwell was\r\nforced to swim with the stream in the vain hope of saving himself from\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1081: In 1536 Henry had sent round a\r\n                   circular to the sheriffs; but its main object was\r\n                   to show that another Parliament was indispensable,\r\n                   to persuade the people that \"their charge and time,\r\n                   which will be very little and short, would be well\r\n                   spent,\" and to secure \"that persons are elected who\r\n                   will serve, and for their worship and qualities be\r\n                   most meet for this purpose\" (_L. and P._, x., 815).\r\n                   The sheriffs in fact were simply to see that the\r\n                   burden was placed on those able and willing to bear\r\n                   it. The best illustration of the methods adopted\r\n                   and of the amount of liberty of election exercised\r\n                   by the constituents may be found in Southampton's\r\n                   letter to Cromwell (_ibid._, XIV., i., 520). At\r\n                   Guildford he told the burgesses they must return\r\n                   two members, which would be a great charge to the\r\n                   town, \"but that if they followed my advice it would\r\n                   cost little or nothing, for I would provide able\r\n                   men to supply the room\". They said that one Daniel\r\n                   Modge wanted one of the seats, but Southampton\r\n                   might arrange for the other. About the Sussex\r\n                   election he was doubtful, but various friends had\r\n                   promised to do their parts. Farnham, he said,\r\n                   returned burgesses (though it does not appear in\r\n                   the _Official Return_), but that was the bishop's\r\n                   town, \"and my Lord Chamberlain is his steward\r\n                   there; so I forbear to meddle\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1082: _L. and P._, XIV., i., 662, 800,\r\n                   808.

He also\r\n                   spoke with Lord St. John about knights of the shire\r\n                   for Hampshire, and St. John \"promised to do his\r\n                   best\". Finally he enclosed a \"schedule of the best\r\n                   men of the country picked out _by them_, that\r\n                   Cromwell may pick whom he would have chosen\".]\r\n\r\nThe principal measure passed in this Parliament was the Act of Six\r\nArticles, and it was designed to secure that unity and concord in\r\nopinions which had not been effected by the King's injunctions. The\r\nAct affirmed the doctrine of Transubstantiation, declared that the\r\nadministration of the Sacrament in both kinds was not necessary, that\r\npriests might not marry, that vows of chastity were perpetual, that\r\nprivate masses were meet and necessary, and auricular confession   (p. 391)\r\nwas expedient and necessary. Burning was the penalty for once denying\r\nthe first article, and a felon's death for twice denying any of the\r\nothers. This was practically the first Act of Uniformity, the earliest\r\ndefinition by Parliament of the faith of the Church. It showed that\r\nthe mass of the laity were still orthodox to the core, that they could\r\npersecute as ruthlessly as the Church itself, and that their only\r\ndesire was to do the persecution themselves. The bill was carried\r\nthrough Parliament by means of a coalition of King and laity[1084]\r\nagainst Cromwell and a minority of reforming bishops, who are said\r\nonly to have relinquished their opposition at Henry's personal\r\nintervention;[1085] and the royal wishes were communicated, when the\r\nKing was not present in person, through Norfolk and not through the\r\nroyal Vicegerent.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1084: \"We of the temporality,\" writes a\r\n                   peer, \"have been all of one mind\" (_L. and P._,\r\n                   XIV., i., 1040; Burnet, vi., 233; _Narratives of\r\n                   the Reformation_, p. 248).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1085: See the present writer's _Cranmer_,\r\n                   p. 129 n. Cranmer afterwards asserted (_Works_,\r\n                   ii., 168) that the Act would never have passed\r\n                   unless the King had come personally into the\r\n                   Parliament house, but that is highly improbable.]\r\n\r\nIt was clear that Cromwell was trembling to his fall. The enmity shown\r\nin Parliament to his doctrinal tendencies was not the result of royal\r\ndictation; for even this Parliament, which gave royal proclamations\r\nthe force of law, could be independent when it chose. The draft of the\r\nAct of Proclamations, as originally submitted to the House of Commons,\r\nprovoked a hot debate, was thrown out, and another was substituted\r\nmore in accord with the sense of the House.[1086] Parliament could\r\nhave rejected the second as easily as it did the first, had it     (p. 392)\r\nwished. Willingly and wittingly it placed this weapon in the royal\r\nhands,[1087] and the chief motive for its action was that overwhelming\r\ndesire for \"union and concord in opinion\" which lay at the root of the\r\nSix Articles. Only one class of offences against royal proclamations\r\ncould be punished with death, and those were offences \"against any\r\nproclamation to be made by the King's Highness, his heirs or successors,\r\nfor or concerning any kind of heresies against Christian doctrine\".\r\nThe King might define the faith by proclamations, and the standard of\r\northodoxy thus set up was to be enforced by the heaviest legal\r\npenalties. England, thought Parliament, could only be kept united\r\nagainst her foreign foes by a rigid uniformity of opinion; and that\r\nuniformity could only be enforced by the royal authority based on lay\r\nsupport, for the Church was now deeply divided in doctrine against\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1086: Husee (_L. and P._, XIV., i., 1158)\r\n                   says the House had been fifteen days over this\r\n                   bill; _cf. Lords' Journals_, 1539.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1087: Parliament is sometimes represented\r\n                   as having almost committed constitutional suicide\r\n                   by this Act; but _cf._ Dicey, _Law and Custom of\r\n                   the Constitution_, p. 357, \"Powers, however\r\n                   extraordinary, which are conferred or sanctioned by\r\n                   statute, are never really unlimited, for they are\r\n                   confined by the words of the Act itself, and what\r\n                   is more by the interpretation put upon the statute\r\n                   by the judges\". There was a world of difference\r\n                   between this and the prerogative independent of\r\n                   Parliament claimed by the Stuarts. Parliament was\r\n                   the foundation, not the rival, of Henry's\r\n                   authority.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the temper of England at the end of 1539. Cromwell and his\r\npolicy, the union with the German princes and the marriage with Anne\r\nof Cleves were merely makeshifts. They stood on no surer foundation\r\nthan the passing political need of some counterpoise to the alliance\r\nof Francis and Charles. So long as that need remained, the marriage\r\nwould hold good, and Henry would strive to dissemble; but not a moment\r\nlonger. The revolution came with startling rapidity; in April,     (p. 393)\r\n1540, Marillac, the French ambassador, reported that Cromwell was\r\ntottering.[1088] The reason was not far to seek. No sooner had the\r\nEmperor passed out of France, than he began to excuse himself from\r\nfulfilling his engagements to Francis. He was resolute never to yield\r\nMilan, for which Francis never ceased to yearn. Charles would have\r\nfound Francis a useful ally for the conquest of England, but his own\r\npossessions were now threatened in more than one quarter, and especially\r\nby the English and German alliance. Henry skilfully widened the breach\r\nbetween the two friends, and, while professing the utmost regard for\r\nFrancis, gave Charles to understand that he vastly preferred the\r\nEmperor's alliance to that of the Protestant princes. Before April he\r\nhad convinced himself that Charles was more bent on reducing Germany\r\nand the Netherlands to order than on any attempt against England, and\r\nthat the abandonment of the Lutheran princes would not lead to their\r\ncombination with the Emperor and Francis. Accordingly he returned a\r\nvery cold answer when the Duke of Cleves's ambassadors came, in May,\r\nto demand his assistance in securing for the Duke the Duchy of\r\nGuelders.[1089]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1088: _L. and P._, xv., 486.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1089: _Ibid._, xv., 735.]\r\n\r\nCromwell's fall was not, however, effected without some violent\r\noscillations, strikingly like the quick changes which preceded the\r\nruin of Robespierre during the Reign of Terror in France. The Vicegerent\r\nhad filled the Court and the Government with his own nominees; at\r\nleast half a dozen bishops, with Cranmer at their head, inclined to\r\nhis theological and political views; Lord Chancellor Audley and the\r\nEarl of Southamton were of the same persuasion; and a small but    (p. 394)\r\nzealous band of reformers did their best, by ballads and sermons, to\r\nprove that the people were thirsting for further religious change. The\r\nCouncil, said Marillac, was divided, each party seeking to destroy the\r\nother. Henry let the factions fight till he thought the time was come\r\nfor him to intervene. In February, 1540, there was a theological encounter\r\nbetween Gardiner and Barnes, the principal agent in Henry's dealings\r\nwith the Lutherans, and Barnes was forced to recant;[1090] in April\r\nGardiner and one or two conservatives, who had long been excluded from\r\nthe Council, were believed to have been readmitted;[1091] and it was\r\nreported that Tunstall would succeed Cromwell as the King's\r\nVicegerent.[1092] But a few days later two of Cromwell's satellites,\r\nWriothesley and Sadleir, were made Secretaries of State; Cromwell\r\nhimself was created Earl of Essex; and, in May, the Bishop of\r\nChichester and two other opponents of reform were sent to the\r\nTower.[1093] At last Henry struck. On the 10th of June Cromwell was\r\narrested; he had, wrote the Council, \"not only been counterworking the\r\nKing's aims for the settlement of religion, but had said that, if the\r\nKing and the realm varied from his opinions, he would withstand them,\r\nand that he hoped in another year or two to bring things to that frame\r\nthat the King could not resist it\".[1094] His cries for mercy evoked\r\nno response in that hardened age.[1095] Parliament condemned him\r\nunheard, and, on the 28th of July, he was beheaded.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1090: _L. and P._, xv., 306, 312, 334.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1091: _Ibid._, xv., 486, 804.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1092: _Ibid._, XIV., ii., 141.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1093: _Ibid._, xv., 737.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1094: Burnet, iv., 415-23; _L. and P._,\r\n                   xv., 765-67.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1095: Merriman, _Cromwell_, ii., 268,\r\n                   273.]\r\n\r\nHenry had in reality come to the conclusion that it was safe to    (p. 395)\r\ndispense with Anne of Cleves and her relatives; and with his will\r\nthere was easily found a way. His case, as stated by himself, was, as\r\nusual, a most ingenious mixture of fact and fiction, reason and\r\nsophistry. His \"intention\" had been defective, and therefore his\r\nadministration of the sacrament of marriage had been invalid. He was\r\nnot a free agent because fear of being left defenceless against\r\nFrancis and Charles had driven him under the yoke. His marriage had\r\nonly been a conditional form. Anne had never received a release from\r\nher contract with the son of the Duke of Lorraine; Henry had only gone\r\nthrough the ceremony on the assumption that that release would be\r\nforthcoming; and actuated by this conscientious scruple, he had\r\nrefrained from consummating the match. To give verisimilitude to this\r\nlast statement, he added the further detail that he found his bride\r\npersonally repugnant. He therefore sought from \"our\" Church a\r\ndeclaration of nullity. Anne was prudently ready to submit to its\r\ndecision; and, through Convocation, Henry's Church, which in his view\r\nexisted mainly to transact his ecclesiastical business, declared, on\r\nthe 7th of July, that the marriage was null and void.[1096] Anne\r\nreceived a handsome endowment of four thousand pounds a year in lands,\r\nwas given two country residences, and lived on amicable terms with\r\nHenry[1097] and his successors till 1558, when she died and was buried\r\nin Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1096: For the canonical reasons on which\r\n                   this decision was based, see the present writer's\r\n                   _Cranmer_, pp. 140, 141.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1097: \"She is,\" writes Marillac in\r\n                   August, \"as joyous as ever, and wears new dresses\r\n                   every day\" (xv., 976; _cf._ Wriothesley\r\n                   _Chronicle_, i., 120).]\r\n\r\nHenry's neck was freed from the matrimonial yoke and the German    (p. 396)\r\nentanglement. The news was promptly sent to Charles, who remarked that\r\nHenry would always find him his loving brother and most cordial\r\nfriend.[1098] At Antwerp it was said that the King had alienated the\r\nGermans, but gained the Emperor and France in their stead.[1099]\r\nLuther declared that \"Junker Harry meant to be God and to do as\r\npleased himself\";[1100] and Melancthon, previously so ready to find\r\nexcuses, now denounced the English King as a Nero, and expressed a\r\nwish that God would put it into the mind of some bold man to\r\nassassinate him.[1101] Francis sighed when he heard the news,\r\nforeseeing a future alliance against him,[1102] but the Emperor's\r\nsecretary believed that God was bringing good out of all these\r\nthings.[1103]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1098: _L. and P._, xv., 863.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1099: _Ibid._, xv., 932.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1100: _Ibid._, xvi., 106.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1101: _Ibid._, xvi., Introd., p. ii. n.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1102: _Ibid._, xv., 870.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1103: _Ibid._, xv., 951.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.                                                        (p. 397)\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of the \"good things\" brought out of the divorce of Anne of\r\nCleves was a fifth wife for the much-married monarch. Parliament,\r\nwhich had petitioned Henry to solve the doubts troubling his subjects\r\nas to the validity (that is to say, political advantages) of his union\r\nwith Anne, now besought him, \"for the good of his people,\" to enter\r\nonce more the holy state of matrimony, in the hope of more numerous\r\nissue. The lady had been already selected by the predominant party,\r\nand used as an instrument in procuring the divorce of her predecessor\r\nand the fall of Cromwell; for, if her morals were something lax,\r\nCatherine Howard's orthodoxy was beyond dispute. She was niece of\r\nCromwell's great enemy, the Duke of Norfolk; and it was at the house\r\nof Bishop Gardiner that she was first given the opportunity of\r\nsubduing the King to her charms.[1104] She was to play the part in the\r\nCatholic reaction that Anne Boleyn had done in the Protestant\r\nrevolution. Both religious parties were unfortunate in the choice of\r\ntheir lady protagonists. Catherine Howard's father, in spite of his\r\nrank, was very penurious, and his daughter's education had been\r\nneglected, while her character had been left at the mercy of any   (p. 398)\r\nchance tempter. She had already formed compromising relations with\r\nthree successive suitors. Her music master, Mannock, boasted that she\r\nhad promised to be his mistress; a kinsman, named Dereham, called her\r\nhis wife; and she was reported to be engaged to her cousin,\r\nCulpepper.[1105] Marillac thought her beauty was commonplace;[1106]\r\nbut that, to judge by her portraits, seems a disparaging verdict. Her\r\neyes were hazel, her hair was auburn, and Nature had been at least as\r\nkind to her as to any of Henry's wives. Even Marillac admitted that\r\nshe had a very winning countenance. Her age is uncertain, but she had\r\nalmost certainly seen more than the twenty-one years politely put down\r\nto her account. Her marriage, like that of Anne Boleyn, was private.\r\nMarillac thought she was already wedded to Henry by the 21st of July,\r\nand the Venetian ambassador at the Court of Charles V. said that the\r\nceremony took place two days after the sentence of Convocation (7th\r\nJuly).[1107] That may be the date of the betrothal, but the marriage\r\nitself was privately celebrated at Oatlands on the 28th of July,[1108]\r\nand Catherine was publicly recognised as Queen at Hampton Court    (p. 399)\r\non the 8th of August, and prayed for as such in the churches on the\r\nfollowing Sunday.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1104: _Original Letters_, Parker Society,\r\n                   i., 202. _cf. L. and P._, xv., 613 [12].\r\n                   Winchester, says Marillac, \"was one of the\r\n                   principal authors of this last marriage, which led\r\n                   to the ruin of Cromwell\" (_ibid._, xvi., 269).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1105: _L. and P._, xvi., 1334.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1106: So says the _D.N.B._, ix., 308;\r\n                   but in _L. and P._, xv., 901, Marillac describes\r\n                   her as \"a lady of great beauty,\" and in xvi., 1366,\r\n                   he speaks of her \"beauty and sweetness\".]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1107: _Venetian Cal._, v., 222.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1108: This is the date given by Dr.\r\n                   Gairdner in _D.N.B._, ix., 304, and is probably\r\n                   correct, though Dr. Gairdner himself gives 8th\r\n                   August in his _Church History_, 1902, p. 218.\r\n                   Wriothesley (_Chron._, i., 121) also says 8th\r\n                   August, but Hall (_Chron._, p. 840) is nearer the\r\n                   truth when he says: \"The eight day of August was\r\n                   the Lady Katharine Howard... _shewed openly as\r\n                   Queen_ at Hampton court\". The original authority\r\n                   for the 28th July is the 3rd Rep. of the Deputy\r\n                   Keeper of Records, App. ii., 264, _viz._, the\r\n                   official record of her trial.]\r\n\r\nThe King was thoroughly satisfied with his new marriage from every\r\npoint of view. The reversal of the policy of the last few years, which\r\nhe had always disliked and for which he avoided responsibility as well\r\nas he could, relieved him at once from the necessity of playing a part\r\nand from the pressing anxiety of foreign dangers. These troubles had\r\npreyed upon his mind and impaired his health; but now, for a time, his\r\nspirits revived and his health returned. He began to rise every\r\nmorning, even in the winter, between five and six, and rode for four\r\nor five hours. He was enamoured of his bride; her views and those of\r\nher uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, and of her patron, Bishop Gardiner,\r\nwere in much closer accord with his own than Anne Boleyn's or\r\nCromwell's had been. Until almost the close of his reign Norfolk was\r\nthe chief instrument of his secular policy, while Gardiner represented\r\nhis ecclesiastical views;[1109] but neither succeeded to the place\r\nwhich Wolsey had held and Cromwell had tried to secure. Henceforth the\r\nKing had no Prime Minister; there was no second Vicegerent, and the\r\npraise or the blame for his policy can be given to no one but Henry.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1109: It was popularly thought that Henry\r\n                   called Gardiner \"his own bishop\" (_L. and P._,\r\n                   XIV., i., 662).]\r\n\r\nThat policy was, in foreign affairs, a close adherence to the Emperor,\r\npartly because it was almost universally held to be the safest course\r\nfor England to pursue, and partly because it gave Henry a free hand\r\nfor the development of his imperialist designs on Scotland. In domestic\r\naffairs the predominant note was the extreme rigour with which the\r\nKing's secular autocracy, his supremacy over the Church, and the   (p. 400)\r\nChurch's orthodox doctrine were imposed on his subjects. Although the\r\nAct of Six Articles had been passed in 1539, Cromwell appears to have\r\nprevented the issue of commissions for its execution. This culpable\r\nnegligence did not please Parliament, and, just before his fall,\r\nanother Act was passed for the more effective enforcement of the Six\r\nArticles. One relaxation was found necessary; it was impossible to\r\ninflict the death penalty on \"incontinent\"[1110] priests, because\r\nthere were so many. But that was the only indulgence granted. Two days\r\nafter Cromwell's death, a vivid illustration was given of the spirit\r\nwhich was henceforth to dominate the Government. Six men were executed\r\nat the same time; three were priests, condemned to be hanged as\r\ntraitors for denying the royal supremacy; three were heretics,\r\ncondemned to be burnt for impugning the Catholic faith.[1111]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1110: 32 Henry VIII., c. 10. Married\r\n                   priests of course would come under this opprobrious\r\n                   title.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1111: Wriothesley, _Chron._, i., 120,\r\n                   121.]\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was no peace. Henry, who had succeeded in so much, had,\r\nwith the full concurrence of the majority of his people, entered upon\r\na task in which he was foredoomed to failure. Not all the whips with\r\nsix strings, not all the fires at Smithfield, could compel that unity\r\nand concord in opinion which Henry so much desired, but which he had\r\nunwittingly done so much to destroy. He might denounce the diversities\r\nof belief to which his opening of the Bible in English churches had\r\ngiven rise; but men, who had caught a glimpse of hidden verities,\r\ncould not all be forced to deny the things which they had seen. The\r\nmost lasting result of Henry's repressive tyranny was the stimulus it\r\ngave to reform in the reign of his son, even as the persecutions   (p. 401)\r\nof Mary finally ruined in England the cause of the Roman Church.\r\nHenry's bishops themselves could scarcely be brought to agreement.\r\nLatimer and Shaxton lost their sees; but the submission of the rest\r\ndid not extend to complete recantation, and the endeavour to stretch\r\nall his subjects on the Procrustean bed of Six Articles was one of\r\nHenry's least successful enterprises.[1112] It was easier to sacrifice\r\na portion of his monastic spoils to found new bishoprics. This had\r\nbeen a project of Wolsey's, interrupted by the Cardinal's fall.\r\nParliament subsequently authorised Henry to erect twenty-six sees; he\r\nactually established six, the Bishoprics of Peterborough, Oxford,\r\nChester, Gloucester, Bristol and Westminster. Funds were also provided\r\nfor the endowment, in both universities, of Regius professorships of\r\nDivinity, Hebrew, Greek, Civil Law and Medicine; and the royal\r\ninterest in the advancement of science was further evinced by the\r\ngrant of a charter to the College of Surgeons, similar to that\r\naccorded early in the reign to the Physicians.[1113]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1112: Henry soon recognised this himself,\r\n                   and a year after the Act was passed he ordered that\r\n                   \"no further persecution should take place for\r\n                   religion, and that those in prison should be set at\r\n                   liberty on finding security for their appearance\r\n                   when called for\" (_L. and P._, xvi., 271). Cranmer\r\n                   himself wrote that \"within a year or a little more\"\r\n                   Henry \"was fain to temper his said laws, and\r\n                   moderate them in divers points; so that the Statute\r\n                   of Six Articles continued in force little above the\r\n                   space of one year\" (_Works_, ii., 168). The idea\r\n                   that from 1539 to 1547 there was a continuous and\r\n                   rigorous persecution is a legend derived from Foxe;\r\n                   there were outbursts of rigour in 1540, 1543, and\r\n                   1546, but except for these the Six Articles\r\n                   remained almost a dead letter (see _L. and P._,\r\n                   XVIII., i., Introd., p. xlix.; pt. ii., Introd., p.\r\n                   xxxiv.; _Original Letters_, Parker Society, ii.,\r\n                   614, 627; Dixon, _Church Hist._, vol. ii., chaps,\r\n                   x., xi.).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1113: In 1518 (_L. and P._, ii., 4450).]\r\n\r\nDisloyalty, meanwhile, was no more extinct than diversity in       (p. 402)\r\nreligious opinion. Early in 1541 there was a conspiracy under Sir John\r\nNeville, in Lincolnshire, and about the same time there were signs\r\nthat the Council itself could not be immediately steadied after the\r\nviolent disturbances of the previous year. Pate, the ambassador at the\r\nEmperor's Court, absconded to Rome in fear of arrest, and his uncle,\r\nLongland, Bishop of Lincoln, was for a time in confinement; Sir John\r\nWallop, Sir Thomas Wyatt, diplomatist and poet, and his secretary, the\r\nwitty and cautious Sir John Mason, were sent to the Tower; both\r\nCromwell's henchmen, Wriothesley and Sadleir, seem to have incurred\r\nsuspicion.[1114] Wyatt, Wallop and Mason were soon released, while\r\nWriothesley and Sadleir regained favour by abjuring their former\r\nopinions; but it was evident that the realisation of arbitrary power\r\nwas gradually destroying Henry's better nature. His suspicion was\r\naroused on the slightest pretext, and his temper was getting worse.\r\nIll-health contributed not a little to this frame of mind. The ulcer\r\non his leg caused him such agony that he sometimes went almost black\r\nin the face and speechless from pain.[1115] He was beginning to look\r\ngrey and old, and was growing daily more corpulent and unwieldy. He\r\nhad, he said, on hearing of Neville's rebellion, an evil people to\r\nrule; he would, he vowed, make them so poor that it would be out of\r\ntheir power to rebel; and, before he set out for the North to\r\nextinguish the discontent and to arrange a meeting with James V., he\r\ncleared the Tower by sending all its prisoners, including the aged (p. 403)\r\nCountess of Salisbury, to the block.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1114: _L. and P._, xvi., 449, 461, 466,\r\n                   467, 469, 470, 474, 482, 488, 506, 523, 534, 611,\r\n                   640, 641; _cf._ the present writer in _D.N.B._, on\r\n                   Mason and Wriothesley.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1115: _Ibid._, XIV., ii., 142; xvi., 121,\r\n                   311, 558, 589, 590; _D.N.B._, xxvi., 89.]\r\n\r\nA greater trial than the failure of James to accept his invitation to\r\nYork awaited Henry on his return from the North. Rumours of Catherine\r\nHoward's past indiscretions had at length reached the ears of the\r\nPrivy Council. On All Saints' Day, 1541, Henry directed his confessor,\r\nthe Bishop of Lincoln, to give thanks to God with him for the good\r\nlife he was leading and hoped to lead with his present Queen,[1116]\r\n\"after sundry troubles of mind which had happened to him by\r\nmarriages\".[1117] At last he thought he had reached the haven of\r\ndomestic peace, whence no roving fancy should tempt him to stray.\r\nTwenty-four hours later Cranmer put in his hand proofs of the Queen's\r\nmisconduct. Henry refused to believe in this rude awakening from his\r\ndreams; he ordered a strict investigation into the charges. Its\r\nresults left no room for doubt. Dereham confessed his intercourse;\r\nMannock admitted that he had taken liberties; and, presently, the\r\nQueen herself acknowledged her guilt. The King was overwhelmed with\r\nshame and vexation; he shed bitter tears, a thing, said the Council,\r\n\"strange in his courage\". He \"has wonderfully felt the case of the\r\nQueen,\" wrote Chapuys;[1118] \"he took such grief,\" added Marillac,\r\n\"that of late it was thought he had gone mad\".[1119] He seems to have\r\npromised his wife a pardon, and she might have escaped with nothing\r\nworse than a divorce, had not proofs come to light of her misconduct\r\nwith Culpepper after her marriage with Henry, and even during their\r\nrecent progress in the North. This offence was high treason, and   (p. 404)\r\ncould not be covered by the King's pardon for Catherine's pre-nuptial\r\nimmorality. Henry, however, was not at ease until Parliament, in\r\nJanuary, 1542, considerately relieved him of all responsibility. The\r\nfaithful Lords and Commons begged him not to take the matter too\r\nheavily, but to permit them freely to proceed with an Act of Attainder,\r\nand to give his assent thereto by commission under the great seal\r\nwithout any words or ceremony, which might cause him pain. Thus\r\noriginated the practice of giving the royal assent to Acts of\r\nParliament by commission.[1120] Another innovation was introduced into\r\nthe Act of Attainder, whereby it was declared treason for any woman to\r\nmarry the King if her previous life had been unchaste; \"few, if any,\r\nladies now at Court,\" commented the cynical Chapuys, \"would henceforth\r\naspire to such an honour\".[1121] The bill received the royal assent on\r\nthe 11th of February, Catherine having declined Henry's permission to\r\ngo down to Parliament and defend herself in person. On the 10th she\r\nwas removed to the Tower, being dressed in black velvet and treated\r\nwith \"as much honour as when she was reigning\".[1122] Three days later\r\nshe was beheaded on the same spot where the sword had severed the fair\r\nneck of Anne Boleyn.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1116: _L. and P._, xvi., 1334.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1117: Herbert, _Life and Reign_, ed.\r\n                   1672, p. 534.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1118: _Ibid._, xvi., 1403.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1119: _Ibid._, xvi., 1426.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1120: _Lords' Journals_, pp. 171, 176.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1121: _L. and P._, xvii., 124.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1122: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the \"good things\" which had come out of the\r\nrepudiation of Anne of Cleves. Other advantages were more permanent.\r\nThe breach between Francis and Charles grew ever wider. In 1541 the\r\nFrench King's ambassadors to the Turk were seized and executed by  (p. 405)\r\nthe order of the imperial governor of Milan.[1123] The outrage brought\r\nFrancis's irritation to a head. He was still pursuing the shadow of a\r\ndeparted glory and the vain hope of dominion beyond the Alps. He had\r\nsecured none of the benefits he anticipated from the imperial\r\nalliance; his interviews with Charles and professions of friendship\r\nwere lost on that heartless schemer, and he realised the force of\r\nHenry's gibe at his expectations from Charles. \"I have myself,\" said\r\nHenry, \"held interviews for three weeks together with the Emperor.\"\r\nBoth sovereigns began to compete for England's favour. The French,\r\nsaid Chapuys, \"now almost offer the English _carte blanche_ for an\r\nalliance\";[1124] and he told Charles that England must, at any price,\r\nbe secured in the imperial interest. In June, 1542, Francis declared\r\nwar on the Emperor, and, by the end of July, four French armies were\r\ninvading or threatening Charles's dominions. Henry, in spite of all\r\ntemptations, was not to be the tool of either; he had designs of his\r\nown; and the breach between Francis and Charles gave him a unique\r\nopportunity for completing his imperialist projects, by extending his\r\nsway over the one portion of the British Isles which yet remained\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1123: _L. and P._, xvi., 984, 991, 1042.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1124: _Ibid._, xvii., 124.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs in the case of similar enterprises, Henry could easily find\r\ncolourable pretexts for his attack on Scots independence.[1125] Beton\r\nhad been made cardinal with the express objects of publishing in\r\nScotland the Pope's Bull against Henry, and of instigating James   (p. 406)\r\nV. to undertake its execution; and the Cardinal held a high place in\r\nthe Scots King's confidence. James had intrigued against England with\r\nboth Charles V. and Francis I., and hopes had been instilled into his\r\nmind that he had only to cross the Border to be welcomed, at least in\r\nthe North, as a deliverer from Henry's oppression. Refugees from the\r\nPilgrimage of Grace found shelter in Scotland, and the ceaseless\r\nBorder warfare might, at any time, have provided either King with a\r\ncase for war, if war he desired. The desire varied, of course, with\r\nthe prospects of success. James V. would, without doubt, have invaded\r\nEngland if Francis and Charles had begun an attack, and if a general\r\ncrusade had been proclaimed against Henry. So, too, war between the\r\ntwo European rivals afforded Henry some chance of success, and placed\r\nin his way an irresistible temptation to settle his account with\r\nScotland. He revived the obsolete claim to suzerainty, and pretended\r\nthat the Scots were rebels.[1126] Had not James V., moreover, refused\r\nto meet him at York to discuss the questions at issue between them?\r\nHenry might well have maintained that he sought no extension of\r\nterritory, but was actuated solely by the desire to remove the     (p. 407)\r\nperpetual menace to England involved in the presence of a foe on\r\nhis northern Borders, in close alliance with his inveterate enemy\r\nacross the Channel. He seems, indeed, to have been willing to conclude\r\npeace, if the Scots would repudiate their ancient connection with\r\nFrance; but this they considered the sheet-anchor of their safety, and\r\nthey declined to destroy it. They gave Henry greater offence by\r\ndefeating an English raid at Halidon Rig, and the desire to avenge a\r\ntrifling reverse became a point of honour in the English mind and a\r\npowerful factor in English policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1125: For relations with Scotland see the\r\n                   _Hamilton Papers_, 2 vols., 1890-92; Thorp's\r\n                   _Scottish Calendar_, vol. i., 1858, and the much\r\n                   more satisfactory _Calendar_ edited by Bain, 1898.\r\n                   A few errors in the _Hamilton Papers_ are pointed\r\n                   out in _L. and P._, vols. xvi.-xix.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1126: This had been asserted by Henry as\r\n                   early as 1524; Scotland was only to be included in\r\n                   the peace negotiations of that year as \"a fief of\r\n                   the King of England\"; it was to be recognised that\r\n                   _supremum ejus dominium_ belonged to Henry, as did\r\n                   the guardianship of James and government of the\r\n                   kingdom during his minority (_Sp.

In 1527 Mendoza declared\r\n                   that all wise people in England preferred a project\r\n                   for marrying the Princess Mary to James V. to her\r\n                   betrothal to Francis I. or the Dauphin (_Sp. Cal._,\r\n                   iii., 156) and that the Scots match was the one\r\n                   really intended by Henry (_ibid._, p. 192; _cf. L.\r\n                   and P._, v., 1078, 1286).]\r\n\r\nThe negotiations lasted throughout the summer of 1542. In October\r\nNorfolk crossed the Borders. The transport broke down; the commissariat\r\nwas most imperfect; and Sir George Lawson of Cumberland was unable to\r\nsupply the army with sufficient beer.[1127] Norfolk had to turn back\r\nat Kelso, having accomplished nothing beyond devastation.[1128] James\r\nnow sought his revenge. He replied to Norfolk's invasion on the East\r\nby throwing the Scots across the Borders on the West. The Warden was\r\nwarned by his spies, but he had only a few hundreds to meet the\r\nthousands of Scots. But, if Norfolk's invasion was an empty parade,\r\nthe Scots attempt was a fearful rout. Under their incompetent leader,\r\nOliver Sinclair, they got entangled in Solway Moss; enormous numbers\r\nwere slain or taken prisoners, and among them were some of the greatest\r\nmen in Scotland. James died broken-hearted at the news, leaving his\r\nkingdom to the week-old infant, Mary, Queen of Scots.[1129] The triumph\r\nof Flodden Field was repeated; a second Scots King had fallen;     (p. 408)\r\nand, for a second time in Henry's reign, Scotland was a prey to the\r\nwoes of a royal minority.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1127: _L. and P._, xvii., 731, 754, 771.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1128: _Ibid._, xvii., 996-98, 1000-1,\r\n                   1037.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1129: See _Hamilton Papers_, vol. i., pp.\r\n                   lxxxiii.-vi.; and the present writer in _D.N.B.,\r\n                   s.v._ \"Wharton, Thomas,\" who commanded the\r\n                   English.]\r\n\r\nWithin a few days of the Scots disaster, Lord Lisle (afterwards Duke\r\nof Northumberland) expressed a wish that the infant Queen were in\r\nHenry's hands and betrothed to Prince Edward, and a fear that the\r\nFrench would seek to remove her beyond the seas.[1130] To realise the\r\nhope and to prevent the fear were the main objects of Henry's foreign\r\npolicy for the rest of his reign. Could he but have secured the\r\nmarriage of Mary to Edward, he would have carried both England and\r\nScotland many a weary stage along the path to Union and to Empire.\r\nBut, unfortunately, he was not content with this brilliant prospect\r\nfor his son. He grasped himself at the Scottish crown; he must be not\r\nmerely a suzerain shadow, but a real sovereign. The Scottish peers,\r\nwho had been taken at Solway Moss, were sworn to Henry VIII., \"to set\r\nforth his Majesty's title that he had to the realm of Scotland\".[1131]\r\nEarly in 1543 an official declaration was issued, \"containing the just\r\ncauses and considerations of this present war with the Scots, wherein\r\nalso appeareth the true and right title that the King's most royal\r\nMajesty hath to the sovereignty of Scotland\"; while Parliament\r\naffirmed that \"the late pretensed King of Scots was but an usurper of\r\nthe crown and realm of Scotland,\" and that Henry had \"now at this\r\npresent (by the infinite goodness of God), a time apt and propice for\r\nthe recovery of his said right and title to the said crown and realm\r\nof Scotland\".[1132] The promulgation of these high-sounding pretensions\r\nwas fatal to the cause which Henry had at heart. Henry VII. had    (p. 409)\r\npursued the earlier and wiser part of the Scottish policy of Edward\r\nI., namely, union by marriage; Henry VIII. resorted to his later\r\npolicy and strove to change a vague suzerainty into a defined and\r\ngalling sovereignty. Seeing no means of resisting the victorious\r\nEnglish arms, the Scots in March, 1543, agreed to the marriage between\r\nHenry's son and their infant Queen. But to admit Henry's extravagant\r\nclaims to Scottish sovereignty was quite a different matter. The mere\r\nmention of them was sufficient to excite distrust and patriotic\r\nresentment. The French Catholic party led by Cardinal Beton was\r\nstrengthened, and, when Francis declared that he would never desert\r\nhis ancient ally, and gave an earnest of his intentions by sending\r\nships and money and men to their aid, the Scots repudiated their\r\ncompact with England, and entered into negotiations for marrying their\r\nQueen to a prince in France.[1133]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1130: _L. and P._, xvii., 1221, 1233.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1131: Wriothesley, _Chron._, i., 140.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1132: 35 Hen. VIII., c. 27.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1133: _L. and P._, vol. xviii.,\r\n                   _passim_.]\r\n\r\nSuch a danger to England must at all costs be averted. Marriages\r\nbetween Scots kings and French princesses had never boded good to\r\nEngland; but the marriage of the Queen of Scotland to a French prince,\r\nand possibly to one who might succeed to the French throne, transcended\r\nall the other perils with which England could be threatened. The union\r\nof the Scots and French crowns would have destroyed the possibility of\r\na British Empire. Henry had sadly mismanaged the business through\r\nvaulting ambition, but there was little fault to be found with his\r\nefforts to prevent the union of France and Scotland; and that was the\r\nreal objective of his last war with France. His aim was not mere\r\nmilitary glory or the conquest of France, as it had been in his    (p. 410)\r\nearlier years under the guidance of Wolsey; it was to weaken or\r\ndestroy a support which enabled Scotland to resist the union with\r\nEngland, and portended a union between Scotland and France. The\r\nEmperor's efforts to draw England into his war with France thus met\r\nwith a comparatively ready response. In May, 1543, a secret treaty\r\nbetween Henry and Charles was ratified; on the 22nd of June a joint\r\nintimation of war was notified to the French ambassador; and a\r\ndetachment of English troops, under Sir John Wallop and Sir Thomas\r\nSeymour, was sent to aid the imperialists in their campaign in the\r\nnorth of France.\r\n\r\nBefore hostilities actually broke out, Henry wedded his sixth and last\r\nwife. Catherine Parr was almost as much married as Henry himself.\r\nThirty-one years of age in 1543, she had already been twice made a\r\nwidow; her first husband was one Edward Borough, her second, Lord\r\nLatimer. Latimer had died at the end of 1542, and Catherine's hand was\r\nimmediately sought by Sir Thomas Seymour, Henry's younger brother-in-law.\r\nSeymour was handsome and won her heart, but he was to be her fourth,\r\nand not her third, husband; her will \"was overruled by a higher\r\npower,\" and, on the 12th of July, she was married to Henry at Hampton\r\nCourt.[1134] Catherine was small in stature, and appears to have made\r\nlittle impression by her beauty; but her character was beyond\r\nreproach, and she exercised a wholesome influence on Henry during his\r\nclosing years. Her task can have been no light one, but her tact\r\novercame all difficulties. She nursed the King with great devotion,\r\nand succeeded to some extent in mitigating the violence of his     (p. 411)\r\ntemper. She intervened to save victims from the penalties of the\r\nAct of Six Articles; reconciled Elizabeth with her father; and was\r\nregarded with affection by both Henry's daughters. Suspicions of her\r\northodoxy and a theological dispute she once had with the King are\r\nsaid to have given rise to a reactionary plot against her.[1135] \"A\r\ngood hearing it is,\" Henry is reported as saying, \"when women become\r\nsuch clerks; and a thing much to my comfort to come in mine old days\r\nto be taught by my wife!\" Catherine explained that her remarks were\r\nonly intended to \"minister talk,\" and that it would be unbecoming in\r\nher to assert opinions contrary to those of her lord. \"Is it so,\r\nsweetheart?\" said Henry; \"then are we perfect friends;\" and when Lord\r\nChancellor Wriothesley came to arrest her, he was, we are told, abused\r\nby the King as a knave, a beast and a fool.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1134: _D.N.B._, ix., 309.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1135: Foxe, ed. Townsend, v., 553-61.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1543-44 and the following spring were spent in preparations\r\nfor war on two fronts.[1136] The punishment of the Scots for repudiating\r\ntheir engagements to England was entrusted to the skilful hands of\r\nHenry's brother-in-law, the Earl of Hertford; while the King himself\r\nwas to renew the martial exploits of his youth by crossing the Channel\r\nand leading an army in person against the French King. The Emperor was\r\nto invade France from the north-east; the two monarchs were then to\r\neffect a junction and march on Paris. There is, however, no instance\r\nin the first half of the sixteenth century of two sovereigns       (p. 412)\r\nheartily combining to secure any one object whatever. Charles and\r\nHenry both wanted to extract concessions from Francis, but the\r\nconcessions were very different, and neither monarch cared much for\r\nthose which the other demanded. Henry's ultimate end related to\r\nScotland, Charles's to Milan and the Lutherans. The Emperor sought to\r\nmake Francis relinquish his claim to Milan and his support of the\r\nGerman princes; Henry was bent on compelling him to abandon the cause\r\nof Scottish independence. If Charles could secure his own terms, he\r\nwould, without the least hesitation, leave Henry to get what he could\r\nby himself; and Henry was equally ready to do Charles a similar turn.\r\nHis suspicions of the Emperor determined his course; he was resolved\r\nto obtain some tangible result; and, before he would advance any\r\nfarther, he sat down to besiege Boulogne. Its capture had been one of\r\nthe objects of Suffolk's invasion of 1523, when Wolsey and his imperialist\r\nallies had induced Henry to forgo the design. The result of that folly\r\nwas not forgotten. Suffolk, his ablest general, now well stricken in\r\nyears, was there to recall it; and, under Suffolk's directions, the\r\nsiege of Boulogne was vigorously pressed. It fell on the 14th of\r\nSeptember. Charles, meanwhile, was convinced that Boulogne was all\r\nHenry wanted, and that the English would never advance to support him.\r\nSo, five days after the fall of Boulogne, he made his peace with\r\nFrancis.[1137] Henry, of course, was loud in his indignation; the\r\nEmperor had made no effort to include him in the settlement, and\r\nrepeated embassies were sent in the autumn to keep Charles to the  (p. 413)\r\nterms of his treaty with England, and to persuade him to renew the war\r\nin the following spring.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1136: See for the Scottish war the\r\n                   _Hamilton Papers_, and for the war in France\r\n                   _Spanish Cal._, vol. vii., and _L. and P._, vol.\r\n                   xix., pt. ii. (to December, 1544).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1137: For Charles's motives see the\r\n                   present writer in _Cambridge Modern History_, ii.,\r\n                   245, 246.]\r\n\r\nHis labours were all in vain, and Henry, for the first time in his\r\nlife was left to face an actual French invasion of England. The horizon\r\nseemed clouded at every point. Hertford, indeed, had carried out his\r\ninstructions in Scotland with signal success. Leith had been burnt and\r\nEdinburgh sacked. But, as soon as he left for Boulogne, things went\r\nwrong in the North, and, in February, 1545, Evers suffered defeat from\r\nthe Scots at Ancrum Moor. Now, when Henry was left without an ally,\r\nwhen the Scots were victorious in the North, when France was ready to\r\nlaunch an Armada against the southern coasts of England, now, surely,\r\nwas the time for a national uprising to depose the bloodthirsty\r\ntyrant, the enemy of the Church, the persecutor of his people.\r\nStrangely enough his people did, and even desired, nothing of the\r\nsort. Popular discontent existed only in the imagination of his\r\nenemies; Henry retained to the last his hold over the mind of his\r\npeople. Never had they been called to pay such a series of loans,\r\nsubsidies and benevolences; never did they pay them so cheerfully. The\r\nKing set a royal example by coining his plate and mortgaging his\r\nestates at the call of national defence; and, in the summer, he went\r\ndown in person to Portsmouth to meet the threatened invasion. The\r\nFrench attack had begun on Boulogne, where Norfolk's carelessness had\r\nput into their hands some initial advantages. But, before dawn, on the\r\n6th of February, Hertford sallied out of Boulogne with four thousand\r\nfoot and seven hundred horse. The French commander, Marechal du Biez,\r\nand his fourteen thousand men were surprised, and they left their  (p. 414)\r\nstores, their ammunition and their artillery in the hands of their\r\nEnglish foes.[1138]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1138: Herbert, ed. 1672, p. 589; Hall, p.\r\n                   862.]\r\n\r\nBoulogne was safe for the time, but a French fleet entered the Solent,\r\nand effected a landing at Bembridge. Skirmishing took place in the\r\nwooded, undulating country between the shore and the slopes of\r\nBembridge Down; the English retreated and broke the bridge over the\r\nYar. This checked the French advance, though a force which was stopped\r\nby that puny stream could not have been very determined. A day or two\r\nlater the French sent round a party to fill their water-casks at the\r\nbrook which trickles down Shanklin Chine; it was attacked and cut to\r\npieces.[1139] They then proposed forcing their way into Portsmouth\r\nHarbour, but the mill-race of the tide at its mouth, and the mysteries\r\nof the sandbanks of Spithead deterred them; and, as a westerly breeze\r\nsprang up, they dropped down before it along the Sussex coast. The\r\nEnglish had suffered a disaster by the sinking of the _Mary Rose_ with\r\nall hands on board, an accident repeated on the same spot two\r\ncenturies later, in the loss of the _Royal George_. But the Admiral,\r\nLisle, followed the French, and a slight action was fought off\r\nShoreham; the fleets anchored for the night almost within gunshot,\r\nbut, when dawn broke, the last French ship was hull-down on the\r\nhorizon. Disease had done more than the English arms, and the French\r\ntroops landed at the mouth of the Seine were the pitiful wreck of an\r\narmy.[1140]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1139: Du Bellay, _Memoirs_, pp. 785-9.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1140: _State Papers_, ed. 1830-51, i.,\r\n                   794, 816.]\r\n\r\nFrance could hope for little profit from a continuance of the war, (p. 415)\r\nand England had everything to gain by its conclusion. The terms of\r\npeace were finally settled in June, 1546.[1141] Boulogne was to remain\r\neight years in English hands, and France was then to pay heavily for\r\nits restitution. Scotland was not included in the peace. In September,\r\n1545, Hertford had revenged the English defeat at Ancrum Moor by a\r\ndesolating raid on the Borders;[1142] early in 1546 Cardinal Beton,\r\nthe soul of the French party, was assassinated, not without Henry's\r\nconnivance; and St. Andrews was seized by a body of Scots Protestants\r\nin alliance with England. Throughout the autumn preparation was being\r\nmade for a fresh attempt to enforce the marriage between Edward and\r\nMary;[1143] but the further prosecution of that enterprise was\r\nreserved for other hands than those of Henry VIII. He left the\r\nrelations between England and Scotland in no better state than he\r\nfound them. His aggressive imperialism paid little heed to the\r\nsusceptibilities of a stubborn, if weaker, foe; and he did not, like\r\nCromwell, possess the military force to crush out resistance. He would\r\nnot conciliate and he could not coerce.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1141: _State Papers_, ed. 1830-51, i.,\r\n                   877, 879; Odet de Selve, pp. 31, 34.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1142: _State Papers_, v., 448-52;\r\n                   _Harleian MS._, 284; _Original Letters_, i., 37.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1143: Odet de Selve, _Corresp.\r\n                   Politique_, 1886, pp. 50-120, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, amid the distractions of his Scottish intrigues, of his\r\ncampaign in France, and of his defence of England, the King was engaged\r\nin his last hopeless endeavour to secure unity and concord in religious\r\nopinion. The ferocious Act of Six Articles had never been more than\r\nfitfully executed; and Henry refrained from using to the full the powers\r\nwith which he had been entrusted by Parliament. The fall of        (p. 416)\r\nCatherine Howard may have impaired the influence of her uncle, the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, who had always expressed his zeal for the burning of\r\nheretics; and the reforming party was rapidly growing in the nation at\r\nlarge, and even within the guarded precincts of the King's Privy\r\nCouncil. Cranmer retained his curious hold over Henry's mind; Hertford\r\nwas steadily rising in favour; Queen Catherine Parr, so far as she\r\ndared, supported the New Learning; the majority of the Council were\r\nprepared to accept the authorised form of religion, whatever it might\r\nhappen to be, and, besides the Howards, Gardiner was the only convinced\r\nand determined champion of the Catholic faith. Even at the moment of\r\nCromwell's fall, there was no intention of undoing anything that had\r\nalready been done; Henry only determined that things should not go so\r\nfast, especially in the way of doctrinal change, as the Vicegerent\r\nwished, for he knew that unity was not to be sought or found in that\r\ndirection. But, between the extremes of Lutheranism and the _status\r\nquo_ in the Church, there was a good deal to be done, in the way of\r\nreform, which was still consistent with the maintenance of the Catholic\r\nfaith. In May, 1541, a fresh proclamation was issued for the use of\r\nthe Bible.[1144] He had, said the King, intended his subjects to read\r\nthe Bible humbly and reverently for their instruction, not reading\r\naloud in time of Holy Mass or other divine service, nor, being laymen,\r\narguing thereon; but, at the same time, he ordered all curates and\r\nparishioners who had failed to obey his former injunctions to provide\r\nan English Bible for their Church without delay. Two months later\r\nanother proclamation followed, regulating the number of saints'    (p. 417)\r\ndays; it was characteristic of the age that various saints' days were\r\nabolished, not so much for the purpose of checking superstition, as\r\nbecause they interfered with the harvest and other secular business.[1145]\r\nOther proclamations came forth in the same year for the destruction of\r\nshrines and the removal of relics. In 1543 a general revision of\r\nservice-books was ordered, with a view to eradicating \"false legends\"\r\nand references to saints not mentioned in the Bible, or in the\r\n\"authentical doctors\".[1146] The Sarum Use was adopted as the standard\r\nfor the clergy of the province of Canterbury, and things were steadily\r\ntending towards that ideal uniformity of service as well as of\r\ndoctrine, which was ultimately embodied in various Acts of Uniformity.\r\nHomilies, \"made by certain prelates,\" were submitted to Convocation,\r\nbut the publication of them, and of the rationale of rites and\r\nceremonies, was deferred to the reign of Edward VI.[1147] The greatest\r\nof all these compositions, the Litany, was, however, sanctioned in\r\n1545.[1148]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1144: _L. and P._, xvi., 819; Burnet,\r\n                   iv., 509.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1145: _L. and P._, xvi., 978, 1022,\r\n                   1027.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1146: _Ibid._, xvi., 1262; xvii., 176.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1147: See the present writer's _Cranmer_,\r\n                   pp. 166-72.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1148: _Ibid._, pp. 172-75.]\r\n\r\nThe King had more to do with the _Necessary Doctrine_, commonly called\r\nthe \"King's Book\" to distinguish it from the Bishops' Book of 1537,\r\nfor which Henry had declined all responsibility. Henry, indeed, had\r\nurged on its revision, he had fully discussed with Cranmer the\r\namendments he thought the book needed, and he had brought the bishops\r\nto an agreement, which they had vainly sought for three years by\r\nthemselves. It was the King who now \"set forth a true and perfect\r\ndoctrine for all his people\".[1149] So it was fondly styled by     (p. 418)\r\nhis Council. A modern high-churchman[1150] asserts that the King's\r\nBook taught higher doctrine than the book which the bishops had\r\ndrafted six years before, but that \"it was far more liberal and better\r\ncomposed\". Whether its excellences amounted to \"a true and perfect\r\ndoctrine\" or not, it failed of its purpose. The efforts of the old and\r\nthe new parties were perpetually driving the Church from the _Via\r\nMedia_, which Henry marked out. On the one hand, we have an act\r\nlimiting the use of the Bible to gentlemen and their families, and\r\nplots to catch Cranmer in the meshes of the Six Articles.[1151] On the\r\nother, there were schemes on the part of some of the Council to entrap\r\nGardiner, and we have Cranmer's assertion[1152] that, in the last\r\nmonths of his reign, the King commanded him to pen a form for the\r\nalteration of the Mass into a Communion, a design obviously to be\r\nconnected with the fact that, in his irritation at Charles's desertion\r\nin 1544, and fear that his neutrality might become active hostility,\r\nHenry had once more entered into communication with the Lutheran\r\nprinces of Germany.[1153]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1149: _L. and P._, XVIII., i., 534.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1150: Canon Dixon.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1151: See the present writer's _Cranmer_,\r\n                   pp. 144-60.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1152: Foxe, on the authority of Cranmer's\r\n                   secretary, Morice, in _Acts and Monuments_, v.,\r\n                   563, 564; it receives some corroboration from\r\n                   Hooper's letter to Bullinger in _Original Letters_,\r\n                   i., 41.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1153: See Hasenclever, _Die Politik der\r\n                   Schmalkaldener vor Ausbruch des Schmalkaldischen\r\n                   Krieges_, 1901.]\r\n\r\nThe only ecclesiastical change that went on without shadow of turning\r\nwas the seizure of Church property by the King; and it is a matter of\r\ncurious speculation as to where he would have stayed his hand had he\r\nlived much longer. The debasement of the coinage had proceeded apace\r\nduring his later years to supply the King's necessities, and,      (p. 419)\r\nfor the same purpose, Parliament, in 1545, granted him all chantries,\r\nhospitals and free chapels. That session ended with Henry's last\r\nappearance before his faithful Lords and Commons, and the speech he\r\nthen delivered may be regarded as his last political will and\r\ntestament.[1154] He spoke, he said, instead of the Lord Chancellor,\r\n\"because he is not so able to open and set forth my mind and meaning,\r\nand the secrets of my heart, in so plain and ample manner, as I myself\r\nam and can do\". He thanked his subjects for their commendation,\r\nprotested that he was \"both bare and barren\" of the virtues a prince\r\nought to have, but rendered to God \"most humble thanks\" for \"such\r\nsmall qualities as He hath indued me withal.... Now, since I find such\r\nkindness in your part towards me, I cannot choose but love and favour\r\nyou; affirming that no prince in the world more favoureth his subjects\r\nthan I do you, nor no subjects or Commons more love and obey their\r\nSovereign Lord, than I perceive you do; for whose defence my treasure\r\nshall not be hidden, nor my person shall not be unadventured. Yet,\r\nalthough I wish you, and you wish me, to be in this perfect love and\r\nconcord, this friendly amity cannot continue, except both you, my\r\nLords Temporal and my Lords Spiritual, and you, my loving subjects,\r\nstudy and take pains to amend one thing, which surely is amiss and far\r\nout of order; to the which I most heartily require you. Which is, that\r\nCharity and Concord is not amongst you, but Discord and Dissension\r\nbeareth rule in every place. Saint Paul saith to the Corinthians, the\r\nthirteenth chapter, _Charity is gentle, Charity is not envious,_\r\n_Charity is not proud_, and so forth. Behold then, what love and   (p. 420)\r\ncharity is amongst you, when one calleth another heretic and\r\nanabaptist, and he calleth him again papist, hypocrite and Pharisee?\r\nBe these tokens of Charity amongst you? Are these signs of fraternal\r\nlove amongst you? No, no, I assure you that this lack of charity among\r\nyourselves will be the hindrance and assuaging of the perfect love\r\nbetwixt us, except this wound be salved and clearly made whole.... I\r\nhear daily that you of the Clergy preach one against another, without\r\ncharity or discretion; some be too stiff in their old _Mumpsimus_,\r\nothers be too busy and curious in their new _Sumpsimus_. Thus all men\r\nalmost be in variety and discord, and few or none preach truly and\r\nsincerely the Word of God.... Yet the Temporalty be not clear and\r\nunspotted of malice and envy. For you rail on Bishops, speak\r\nslanderously of Priests, and rebuke and taunt preachers, both contrary\r\nto good order and Christian fraternity. If you know surely that a\r\nBishop or Preacher erreth, or teacheth perverse doctrine, come and\r\ndeclare it to some of our Council, or to us, to whom is committed by\r\nGod the high authority to reform such causes and behaviours. And be\r\nnot judges of yourselves of your fantastical opinions and vain\r\nexpositions.... I am very sorry to know and to hear how unreverently\r\nthat most precious jewel, the Word of God, is disputed, rhymed, sung,\r\nand jangled in every Ale-house and Tavern.... And yet I am even as\r\nmuch sorry that the readers of the same follow it in doing so faintly\r\nand so coldly. For of this I am sure, that charity was never so faint\r\namongst you, and virtuous and godly living was never less used, nor\r\nGod Himself among Christians was never less reverenced, honoured,  (p. 421)\r\nor served. Therefore, as I said before, be in charity one with another\r\nlike brother and brother; love, dread, and serve God; to which I, as\r\nyour Supreme Head and Sovereign Lord, exhort and require you; and then\r\nI doubt not but that love and league, that I spake of in the\r\nbeginning, shall never be dissolved or broke betwixt us.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1154: Hall, _Chron._, pp. 864-66; Foxe,\r\n                   ed.

The King was\r\nable to make his usual progress in August and September, 1546; from\r\nWestminster he went to Hampton Court, thence to Oatlands, Woking and\r\nGuildford, and from Guildford to Chobham and Windsor, where he spent\r\nthe month of October. Early in November he came up to London, staying\r\nfirst at Whitehall and then at Ely Place. From Ely Place he returned,\r\non the 3rd of January, 1547, to Whitehall, which he was never to leave\r\nalive.[1155] He is said to have become so unwieldy that he could\r\nneither walk nor stand, and mechanical contrivances were used at\r\nWindsor and his other palaces for moving the royal person from room to\r\nroom. His days were numbered and finished, and every one thought of\r\nthe morrow. A child of nine would reign, but who should rule? Hertford\r\nor Norfolk? The party of reform or that of reaction? Henry had\r\napparently decided that neither should dominate the other, and\r\ndesigned a balance of parties in the council he named for his\r\nchild-successor.[1156]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1155: This itinerary is worked out from\r\n                   the _Acts of the Privy Council_, ed. Dasent, vol.\r\n                   i.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1156: This is the usual view, but it is a\r\n                   somewhat doubtful inference. Henry's one object was\r\n                   the maintenance of order and his own power; he\r\n                   would never have set himself against the nation as\r\n                   a whole, and there are indications that at the end\r\n                   of his reign he was preparing to accept the\r\n                   necessity of further changes. The fall of the\r\n                   Howards was due to the fear that they would cause\r\n                   trouble in the coming minority of Edward VI. Few\r\n                   details are known of the party struggle in the\r\n                   Council in the autumn of 1546, and they come from\r\n                   Selve's _Correspondance_ and the new volume (1904)\r\n                   of the _Spanish Calendar_ (1545-47). These should\r\n                   be compared with Foxe, vol. v.]\r\n\r\nSuddenly the balance upset. On the 12th of December, 1546,         (p. 422)\r\nNorfolk and his son, the Earl of Surrey, were arrested for treason and\r\nsent to the Tower. Endowed with great poetic gifts, Surrey had even\r\ngreater defects of character. Nine years before he had been known as\r\n\"the most foolish proud boy in England\".[1157] Twice he had been\r\ncommitted to prison by the Council for roaming the streets of the city\r\nat night and breaking the citizens' windows,[1158] offences venial in\r\nthe exuberance of youth, but highly unbecoming in a man who was nearly\r\nthirty, who aspired to high place in the councils of the realm, and\r\nwho despised most of his colleagues as upstarts. His enmity was\r\nspecially directed against the Prince's uncles, the Seymours. Hertford\r\nhad twice been called in to retrieve Surrey's military blunders.\r\nSurrey made improper advances to Hertford's wife, but repudiated with\r\nscorn his father's suggestion for a marriage alliance between the two\r\nfamilies.[1159] His sister testified that he had advised her to become\r\nthe King's mistress, with a view to advancing the Howard interests.\r\nWho, he asked, should be Protector, in case the King died, but his\r\nfather? He quartered the royal arms with his own, in spite of the  (p. 423)\r\nheralds' prohibition. This at once roused Henry's suspicions; he\r\nknew that, years before, Norfolk had been suggested as a possible\r\nclaimant to the throne, and that a marriage had been proposed between\r\nSurrey and the Princess Mary.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1157: _L. and P._, XIV., ii., 141.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1158: _Acts of the Privy Council_, i.,\r\n                   104; Bapst, _Deux Gentilshommes poetes a la cour\r\n                   d'Henri VIII._, p. 269.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1159: See the present writer in _D.N.B.,\r\n                   s.v._ \"Seymour, Edward\"; _cf._ Herbert, pp.\r\n                   625-33.

It came from Sir Richard Southwell, a Catholic and\r\na man of weight and leading in Norfolk, like the Howards themselves;\r\nhe even appears to have been brought up with Surrey, and for many\r\nyears had been intimate with the Howard family. When Surrey was called\r\nbefore the Council to answer Southwell's charges, he wished to fight\r\nhis accuser, but both were committed to custody. The case was\r\ninvestigated by the King himself, with the help of another Catholic,\r\nLord Chancellor Wriothesley. The Duke of Norfolk confessed to\r\ntechnical treason in concealing his son's offences, and was sent to\r\nthe Tower. On the 13th of January, 1547, Surrey was found guilty by a\r\nspecial commission sitting at the Guildhall;[1160] a week later he was\r\nbeheaded.[1161] On the 18th Parliament met to deal with the Duke; by\r\nthe 24th a bill of attainder had passed all its stages and awaited\r\nonly the King's assent. On Thursday, the 27th, that assent was given\r\nby royal commission.[1162] Orders are said to have been issued for the\r\nDuke's execution the following morning.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1160: See an account of his trial in\r\n                   _Stowe MS._, 396.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1161: Wriothesley, _Chron._ i., 177, says\r\n                   19th January; other authorities give the 21st.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1162: _Lords' Journals_, p. 289.]\r\n\r\nThat night Norfolk lay doomed in his cell in the Tower, and Henry  (p. 424)\r\nVIII. in his palace at Westminster. The Angel of Death hovered over\r\nthe twain, doubting which to take. Eighteen years before, the King had\r\nsaid that, were his will opposed, there was never so noble a head in\r\nhis kingdom but he would make it fly.[1163] Now his own hour was come,\r\nand he was loth to hear of death. His physicians dared not breathe the\r\nword, for to prophesy the King's decease was treason by Act of\r\nParliament. As that long Thursday evening wore on, Sir Anthony Denny,\r\nchief gentleman of the chamber, \"boldly coming to the King, told him\r\nwhat case he was in, to man's judgment not like to live; and therefore\r\nexhorted him to prepare himself to death\".[1164] Sensible of his\r\nweakness, Henry \"disposed himself more quietly to hearken to the words\r\nof his exhortation, and to consider his life past; which although he\r\nmuch abused, 'yet,' said he, 'is the mercy of Christ able to pardon me\r\nall my sins, though they were greater than they be'\". Denny then asked\r\nif he should send for \"any learned man to confer withal and to open\r\nhis mind unto\". The King replied that if he had any one, it should be\r\nCranmer; but first he would \"take a little sleep; and then, as I feel\r\nmyself, I will advise upon the matter\". And while he slept, Hertford\r\nand Paget paced the gallery outside, contriving to grasp the reins of\r\npower as they fell from their master's hands.[1165] When the King woke\r\nhe felt his feebleness growing upon him, and told Denny to send for\r\nCranmer. The Archbishop came about midnight: Henry was speechless, and\r\nalmost unconscious. He stretched out his hand to Cranmer, and      (p. 425)\r\nheld him fast, while the Archbishop exhorted him to give some token\r\nthat he put his trust in Christ. The King wrung Cranmer's hand with\r\nhis fast-ebbing strength, and so passed away about two in the morning,\r\non Friday, the 28th of January, 1547. He was exactly fifty-five years\r\nand seven months old, and his reign had lasted for thirty-seven years\r\nand three-quarters.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1163: _L. and P._, iv., 4942.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1164: Foxe, ed.

Mem_., II., ii., 430.]\r\n\r\n\"And for my body,\" wrote Henry in his will,[1166] \"which when the soul\r\nis departed, shall then remain but as a _cadaver_, and so return to\r\nthe vile matter it was made of, were it not for the crown and dignity\r\nwhich God hath called us unto, and that We would not be counted an\r\ninfringer of honest worldly policies and customs, when they be not\r\ncontrary to God's laws, We would be content to have it buried in any\r\nplace accustomed to Christian folks, were it never so vile, for it is\r\nbut ashes, and to ashes it shall return. Nevertheless, because We\r\nwould be loth, in the reputation of the people, to do injury to the\r\nDignity, which We are unworthily called unto, We are content to will\r\nand order that Our body be buried and interred in the choir of Our\r\ncollege of Windsor.\" On the 8th of February, in every parish church in\r\nthe realm, there was sung a solemn dirge by night, with all the bells\r\nringing, and on the morrow a Requiem mass for the soul of the\r\nKing.[1167] Six days later his body \"was solemnly with great honour\r\nconveyed in a chariot towards Windsor,\" and the funeral procession\r\nstretched four miles along the roads. That night the body lay at   (p. 426)\r\nSion under a hearse, nine storeys high. On the 15th it was taken to\r\nWindsor, where it was met by the Dean and choristers of the Chapel\r\nRoyal, and by the members of Eton College. There in the castle it\r\nrested under a hearse of thirteen storeys; and on the morrow it was\r\nburied, after mass, in the choir of St. George's Chapel.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1166: The original is in the Record\r\n                   Office; a copy of it was made for each executor,\r\n                   and it has been often printed; see _England under\r\n                   Protector Somerset_, p. 5 n.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1167: Wriothesley, _Chron._, i., 181.]\r\n\r\nMidway between the stalls and the Altar the tomb of Queen Jane Seymour\r\nwas opened to receive the bones of her lord. Hard by stood that\r\nmausoleum \"more costly than any royal or papal monument in the\r\nworld,\"[1168] which Henry VII. had commenced as a last resting-place\r\nfor himself and his successors, but had abandoned for his chapel in\r\nWestminster Abbey. His son bestowed the building on Wolsey, who\r\nprepared for his own remains a splendid cenotaph of black and white\r\nmarble. On the Cardinal's fall Henry VIII. designed both tomb and\r\nchapel for himself _post multos et felices annos_.[1169] But King and\r\nCardinal reaped little honour by these strivings after posthumous\r\nglory. The dying commands of the monarch, whose will had been\r\nomnipotent during his life, remained unfulfilled; the memorial chapel\r\nwas left incomplete; and the monument of marble was taken down,\r\ndespoiled of its ornaments and sold in the Great Rebellion. At length,\r\nin a happier age, after more than three centuries of neglect, the\r\nmagnificent building was finished, but not in Henry's honour; it was\r\nadorned and dedicated to the memory of a prince in whose veins there\r\nflowed not a drop of Henry's blood.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1168: _L. and P._, iv., Introd., p.\r\n                   dcxviii.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1169: _Ibid.; cf._ Pote, _Hist. of\r\n                   Windsor Castle_, 1749.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.                                                       (p. 427)\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo died and so was buried the most remarkable man who ever sat on the\r\nEnglish throne. His reign, like his character, seems to be divided\r\ninto two inconsistent halves. In 1519 his rule is pronounced more\r\nsuave and gentle than the greatest liberty anywhere else; twenty years\r\nlater terror is said to reign supreme. It is tempting to sum up his\r\nlife in one sweeping generalisation, and to say that it exhibits a\r\ncontinuous development of Henry's intellect and deterioration of his\r\ncharacter. Yet it is difficult to read the King's speech in Parliament\r\nat the close of 1545, without crediting him with some sort of ethical\r\nideas and aims; his life was at least as free from vice during the\r\nlast, as during the first, seven years of his reign; in seriousness of\r\npurpose and steadfastness of aim it was immeasurably superior; and at\r\nno time did Henry's moral standard vary greatly from that of many whom\r\nthe world is content to regard as its heroes. His besetting sin was\r\negotism, a sin which princes can hardly, and Tudors could nowise,\r\navoid. Of egotism Henry had his full share from the beginning; at\r\nfirst it moved in a limited, personal sphere, but gradually it\r\nextended its scope till it comprised the whole realm of national\r\nreligion and policy. The obstacles which he encountered in         (p. 428)\r\nprosecuting his suit for a divorce from Catherine of Aragon were the\r\nfirst check he experienced in the gratification of a personal whim,\r\nand the effort to remove those impediments drew him on to the\r\nworld-wide stage of the conflict with Rome. He was ever proceeding\r\nfrom the particular to the general, from an attack on a special\r\ndispensation to an attack on the dispensing power of the Pope, and\r\nthence to an assault on the whole edifice of papal claims. He started\r\nwith no desire to separate England from Rome, or to reform the\r\nAnglican Church; those aims he adopted, little by little, as\r\nsubsidiary to the attainment of his one great personal purpose. He\r\narrived at his principles by a process of deduction from his own\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\nAs Henry went on, his \"quick and penetrable eyes,\" as More described\r\nthem, were more and more opened to the extent of what he could do; and\r\nhe realised, as he said, how small was the power of the Pope. Papal\r\nauthority had always depended on moral influence and not on material\r\nresources. That moral influence had long been impaired; the sack of\r\nRome in 1527 afforded further demonstration of its impotence; and,\r\nwhen Clement condoned that outrage, and formed a close alliance with\r\nthe chief offender, the Papacy suffered a blow from which it never\r\nrecovered. Temporal princes might continue to recognise the Pope's\r\nauthority, but it was only because they chose, and not because they\r\nwere compelled so to do; they supported him, not as the divinely\r\ncommissioned Vicar of Christ, but as a useful instrument in the\r\nprosecution of their own and their people's desires. It is called a\r\ntheological age, but it was also irreligious, and its principal    (p. 429)\r\nfeature was secularisation. National interests had already become the\r\ndominant factor in European politics; they were no longer to be made\r\nsubservient to the behests of the universal Church. The change was\r\ntacitly or explicitly recognised everywhere; and _cujus regio, ejus\r\nreligio_ was the principle upon which German ecclesiastical politics\r\nwere based at the Peace of Augsburg. It was assumed that each prince\r\ncould do what he liked in his own country; they might combine to make\r\nwar on an excommunicate king, but only if war suited their secular\r\npolicy; and the rivalry between Francis and Charles was so keen, that\r\neach set greater store upon Henry's help than upon his destruction.\r\n\r\nThus the breach with Rome was made a possible, though not an easy,\r\ntask; and Henry was left to settle the matter at home with little to\r\nfear from abroad, except threats which he knew to be empty. England\r\nwas the key of the situation, and in England must be sought the chief\r\ncauses of Henry's success. If we are to believe that Henry's policy\r\nwas at variance with the national will, his reign must remain a\r\npolitical mystery, and we can offer no explanation of the facts that\r\nHenry was permitted to do his work at all, and that it has stood so\r\nlong the test of time. He had, no doubt, exceptional facilities for\r\ngetting his way. His dictatorship was the child of the Wars of the\r\nRoses, and his people, conscious of the fact that Henry was their only\r\nbulwark against the recurrence of civil strife, and bound up as they\r\nwere in commercial and industrial pursuits, were willing to bear with\r\na much more arbitrary government than they would have been in less\r\nperilous times. The alternatives may have been evil, but the choice\r\nwas freely made. No government, whatever its form, whatever its    (p. 430)\r\nresources, can permanently resist the national will; every nation\r\nhas, roughly speaking, the government it deserves and desires, and a\r\npopular vote would never in Henry's reign have decreed his deposition.\r\nThe popular mind may be ill-informed, distorted by passion and\r\nprejudice, and formed on selfish motives. Temporarily, too, the\r\npopular will may be neutralised by skilful management on the part of\r\nthe government, by dividing its enemies and counterworking their\r\nplans; and of all those arts Henry was a past master. But such\r\nexpedients cannot prevail in the end; in 1553 the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland had a subtle intellect and all the machinery of Tudor\r\ngovernment at his disposal; Queen Mary had not a man, nor a shilling.\r\nYet Mary, by popular favour, prevailed without shedding a drop of\r\nblood. Henry himself was often compelled to yield to his people.\r\nAbject self-abasement on their part and stupendous power of will on\r\nHenry's, together provide no adequate solution for the history of his\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nWith all his self-will, Henry was never blind to the distinction\r\nbetween what he could and what he could not do. Strictly speaking, he\r\nwas a constitutional king; he neither attempted to break up\r\nParliament, nor to evade the law. He combined in his royal person the\r\nparts of despot and demagogue, and both he clothed in Tudor grace and\r\nmajesty. He led his people in the way they wanted to go, he tempted\r\nthem with the baits they coveted most, he humoured their prejudices\r\nagainst the clergy and against the pretensions of Rome, and he used\r\nevery concession to extract some fresh material for building up his\r\nown authority. He owed his strength to the skill with which he     (p. 431)\r\nappealed to the weaknesses of a people, whose prevailing characteristics\r\nwere a passion for material prosperity and an absolute indifference to\r\nhuman suffering. \"We,\" wrote one of Henry's Secretaries of State, \"we,\r\nwhich talk much of Christ and His Holy Word, have, I fear me, used a\r\nmuch contrary way; for we leave fishing of men, and fish again in the\r\ntempestuous seas of this world for gain and wicked Mammon.\"[1170] A\r\nfew noble examples, Catholic and Protestant, redeemed, by their blood,\r\nthe age from complete condemnation, but, in the mass of his subjects,\r\nthe finer feelings seem to have been lost in the pursuit of wealth.\r\nThere is no sign that the hideous tortures inflicted on men condemned\r\nfor treason, or the equally horrible sufferings of heretics burnt at\r\nthe stake, excited the least qualm of compassion in the breast of the\r\nmultitude; the Act of Six Articles seems to have been rather a popular\r\nmeasure, and the multiplication of treasons evoked no national\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1170: Sir William Petre in Tytler's\r\n                   _Edward VI. and Mary_, i., 427.]\r\n\r\nHenry, indeed, was the typical embodiment of an age that was at once\r\ncallous and full of national vigour, and his failings were as much a\r\nsource of strength as his virtues. His defiance of the conscience of\r\nEurope did him no harm in England, where the splendid isolation of\r\n_Athanasius contra mundum_ is always a popular attitude; and even his\r\nbitterest foes could scarce forbear to admire the dauntless front he\r\npresented to every peril. National pride was the highest motive to\r\nwhich he appealed. For the rest, he based his power on his people's\r\nmaterial interests, and not on their moral instincts. He took no such\r\nhold of the ethical nature of men as did Oliver Cromwell, but he   (p. 432)\r\nwas liked none the less for that; for the nation regarded Cromwell,\r\nthe man of God, with much less favour than Charles II., the man of\r\nsin; and statesmen who try to rule on exclusively moral principles are\r\nseldom successful and seldom beloved. Henry's successor, Protector\r\nSomerset, made a fine effort to introduce some elements of humanity\r\ninto the spirit of government; but he perished on the scaffold, while\r\nhis colleagues denounced his gentleness and love of liberty, and\r\ndeclared that his repeal of Henry's savage treason-laws was the worst\r\ndeed done in their generation.[1171]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1171: Sir John Mason, quoted in Froude,\r\n                   iv., 306 n.]\r\n\r\nThe King avoided the error of the Protector; he was neither behind nor\r\nbefore the average man of the time; he appealed to the mob, and the\r\nmob applauded. _Salus populi_, he said in effect, _suprema lex_, and\r\nthe people agreed; for that is a principle which suits demagogues no\r\nless than despots, though they rarely possess Henry's skill in working\r\nit out. Henry, it is true, modified the maxim slightly by substituting\r\nprince for people, and by practising, before it was preached, Louis\r\nXIV.'s doctrine that _L'Etat, c'est moi_. But the assumption that the\r\nwelfare of the people was bound up with that of their King was no idle\r\npretence; it was based on solid facts, the force of which the people\r\nthemselves admitted. They endorsed the tyrant's plea of necessity. The\r\npressure of foreign rivalries, and the fear of domestic disruption,\r\nconvinced Englishmen of the need for despotic rule, and no consideration\r\nwhatever was allowed to interfere with the stability of government;\r\nindividual rights and even the laws themselves must be overridden, if\r\nthey conflicted with the interests of the State. Torture was illegal\r\nin England, and men were proud of the fact, yet, in cases of       (p. 433)\r\ntreason, when the national security was thought to be involved, torture\r\nwas freely used, and it was used by the very men who boasted of\r\nEngland's immunity. They were conscious of no inconsistency; the\r\ncommon law was very well as a general rule, but the highest law of all\r\nwas the welfare of the State.\r\n\r\nThis was the real tyranny of Tudor times; men were dominated by the\r\nidea that the State was the be-all and end-all of human existence. In\r\nits early days the State is a child; it has no will and no ideas of\r\nits own, and its first utterances are merely imitation and repetition.\r\nBut by Henry VIII.'s reign the State in England had grown to lusty\r\nmanhood; it dismissed its governess, the Church, and laid claim to\r\nthat omnipotence and absolute sovereignty which Hobbes regretfully\r\nexpounded in his _Leviathan_.[1172] The idea supplied an excuse to\r\ndespots and an inspiration to noble minds. \"Surely,\" wrote a genuine\r\npatriot in 1548,[1173] \"every honest man ought to refuse no pains, no\r\ntravail, no study, he ought to care for no reports, no slanders, no\r\ndispleasure, no envy, no malice, so that he might profit the commonwealth\r\nof his country, for whom next after God he is created.\" The service of\r\nthe State tended, indeed, to encroach on the service of God, and to\r\nobliterate altogether respect for individual liberty. Wolsey on his\r\ndeath-bed was visited by qualms of conscience, but, as a rule, victims\r\nto the principle afford, by their dying words, the most striking   (p. 434)\r\nillustrations of the omnipotence of the idea. Condemned traitors are\r\nconcerned on the scaffold, not to assert their innocence, but to\r\nproclaim their readiness to die as an example of obedience to the law.\r\nHowever unfair the judicial methods of Tudor times may seem to us, the\r\nsufferers always thank the King for granting them free trial. Their\r\nguilt or innocence is a matter of little moment; the one thing needful\r\nis that no doubt should be thrown on the inviolability of the will of\r\nthe State; and the audience commend them. They are not expected to\r\nconfess or to express contrition, but merely to submit to the decrees\r\nof the nation; if they do that, they are said to make a charitable and\r\ngodly end, and they deserve the respect and sympathy of men; if not,\r\nthey die uncharitably, and are held up to reprobation.[1174] To an age\r\nlike that there was nothing strange in the union of State and      (p. 435)\r\nChurch and the supremacy of the King over both; men professed Christianity\r\nin various forms, but to all men alike the State was their real\r\nreligion, and the King was their great High Priest. The sixteenth\r\ncentury, and especially the reign of Henry VIII., supplies the most\r\nvivid illustration of the working, both for good and for evil, of the\r\ntheory that the individual should be subordinate in goods, in life and\r\nin conscience to the supreme dictates of the national will. This\r\ntheory was put into practice by Henry VIII. long before it was made\r\nthe basis of any political philosophy, just as he practised\r\nErastianism before Erastus gave it a name.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1172: The _Leviathan_ is the best\r\n                   philosophical commentary on the Tudor system;\r\n                   Hobbes was Tudor and not Stuart in all his ideas,\r\n                   and his assertion of the Tudor _de facto_ theory of\r\n                   monarchy as against the Stuart _de jure_ theory\r\n                   brought him into disfavour with Cavaliers.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1173: John Hales in _Lansdowne MS._, 238;\r\n                   _England under Protector Somerset_, p. 216.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1174: _L. and P._, x., 920; \"all which\r\n                   died charitably,\" writes Husee of Anne Boleyn and\r\n                   her fellow-victims; Rochford \"made a very catholic\r\n                   address to the people saying he had not come there\r\n                   to preach but to serve as a mirror and example,\r\n                   acknowledging his sins against God and the King\"\r\n                   (_ibid._, x., 911; _cf._ xvii., 124). Cromwell and\r\n                   Somerset had more cause to complain of their fate\r\n                   than other statesmen of the time, yet Cromwell on\r\n                   the scaffold says: \"I am by the law condemned to\r\n                   die, and thank my Lord God that hath appointed me\r\n                   this death for mine offence.... I have offended my\r\n                   prince, for the which I ask him heartily\r\n                   forgiveness\" (Foxe, v., 402). And Somerset says: \"I\r\n                   am condemned by a law whereunto I am subject, as we\r\n                   all; and therefore to show obedience I am content\r\n                   to die\" (Ellis, _Orig. Letters_, II., ii., 215;\r\n                   _England under Somerset_, p. 308). Compare\r\n                   Buckingham in Shakespeare, \"_Henry VIII._,\" Act\r\n                   II., Sc. i.:--\r\n\r\n                        \"I bear the law no malice for my death\r\n                           ... my vows and prayers\r\n                         Yet are the King's; and till my soul forsake\r\n                         Shall cry for blessings on him.\"]\r\n\r\nThe devotion paid to the State in Tudor times inevitably made expediency,\r\nand not justice or morality, the supreme test of public acts. The\r\ndictates of expediency were, indeed, clothed in legal forms, but laws\r\nare primarily intended to secure neither justice nor morality, but the\r\ninterests of the State; and the highest penalty known to the law is\r\ninflicted for high treason, a legal and political crime which does not\r\nnecessarily involve any breach whatever of the code of morals.\r\nTraitors are not executed because they are immoral, but because they\r\nare dangerous. Never did a more innocent head fall on the scaffold\r\nthan that of Lady Jane Grey; never was an execution more fully\r\njustified by the law. The contrast was almost as flagrant in many a\r\nState trial in the reign of Henry VIII.; no king was so careful of\r\nlaw,[1175] but he was not so careful of justice. Therein lay his\r\nsafety, for the law takes no cognisance of injustice, unless the\r\ninjustice is also a breach of the law, and Henry rarely, if ever,  (p. 436)\r\nbroke the law. Not only did he keep the law, but he contrived that the\r\nnation should always proclaim the legality of his conduct. Acts of\r\nattainder, his favourite weapon, are erroneously supposed to have been\r\nthe method to which he resorted for removing opponents whose conviction\r\nhe could not obtain by a legal trial. But acts of attainder were, as a\r\nrule, supplements to, not substitutes for, trials by jury;[1176] many\r\nwere passed against the dead, whose goods had already been forfeited\r\nto the King as the result of judicial verdicts. Moreover, convictions\r\nwere always easier to obtain from juries than acts of attainder from\r\nParliament. It was simplicity itself to pack a jury of twelve, and\r\neven a jury of peers; but it was a much more serious matter to pack\r\nboth Houses of Parliament. What then was the meaning and use of acts\r\nof attainder? They were acts of indemnity for the King. People might\r\ncavil at the verdict of juries; for they were only the decisions of a\r\nhandful of men; but who should impugn the voice of the whole body\r\npolitic expressed in its most solemn, complete and legal form? There\r\nis no way, said Francis to Henry in 1532, so safe as by Parliament,[1177]\r\nand one of Henry's invariable methods was to make the whole        (p. 437)\r\nnation, so far as he could, his accomplice. For pardons and acts of\r\ngrace the King was ready to assume the responsibility; but the nation\r\nitself must answer for rigorous deeds. And acts of attainder were\r\nneither more nor less than deliberate pronouncements, on the part of\r\nthe people, that it was expedient that one man should die rather than\r\nthat the whole nation should perish or run any risk of danger.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1175: \"I never knew,\" writes Bishop\r\n                   Gardiner a few months after Henry's death, \"man\r\n                   committed to prison for disagreeing to any doctrine\r\n                   unless the same doctrine were established by a law\r\n                   of the realm before\" (Foxe, ed. Townsend, vi.,\r\n                   141).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1176: The Countess of Salisbury and\r\n                   Cromwell are the two great exceptions.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1177: _L. and P._, vi., 954. It may be\r\n                   reading too much into Francis I.'s words, but it is\r\n                   tempting to connect them with Machiavelli's opinion\r\n                   that the French _parlement_ was devised to relieve\r\n                   the Crown of the hostility aroused by curbing the\r\n                   power of the nobles (_Il Principe_ c. 19). A closer\r\n                   parallel to the policy of Henry VIII. may be found\r\n                   in that which Tacitus attributes to Tiberius with\r\n                   regard to the Senate; \"he must devolve on the\r\n                   Senate the odious duty of trial and condemnation\r\n                   and reserve only the credit of clemency for\r\n                   himself\" (Furneaux, _Tacitus_, Introd.).]\r\n\r\nHistory, in a democratic age, tends to become a series of popular\r\napologies, and is inclined to assume that the people can do no wrong;\r\nsome one must be the scapegoat for the people's sins, and the national\r\nsins of Henry's reign are all laid on Henry's shoulders. But the\r\nnation in the sixteenth century deliberately condoned injustice, when\r\ninjustice made for its peace. It has done so before and after, and may\r\npossibly do so again. It is easy in England to-day to denounce the\r\ncruel sacrifices imposed on individuals in the time of Henry VIII. by\r\ntheir subordination in everything to the interests of the State; but,\r\nwhenever and wherever like dangers have threatened, recourse has been\r\nhad to similar methods, to government by proclamation, to martial law,\r\nand to verdicts based on political expediency.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between morals and politics, which comes out in Henry's\r\nreign as a terrible contradiction, is inherent in all forms of human\r\nsociety. Politics, the action of men in the mass, are akin to the\r\noperation of natural forces; and, as such, they are neither moral nor\r\nimmoral; they are simply non-moral. Political movements are often as\r\nresistless as the tides of the ocean; they carry to fortune, and they\r\nbear to ruin, the just and the unjust with heedless impartiality. Cato\r\nand Brutus striving against the torrent of Roman imperialism,      (p. 438)\r\nFisher and More seeking to stem the secularisation of the Church, are\r\nlike those who would save men's lives from the avalanche by preaching\r\nto the mountain on the text of the sixth commandment. The efforts of\r\ngood men to avert a sure but cruel fate are the truest theme of the\r\nTragic Muse; and it is possible to represent Henry's reign as one long\r\nnightmare of \"truth for ever on the scaffold, wrong for ever on the\r\nthrone\"; for Henry VIII. embodied an inevitable movement of politics,\r\nwhile Fisher and More stood only for individual conscience.\r\n\r\nThat is the secret of Henry's success. He directed the storm of a\r\nrevolution which was doomed to come, which was certain to break those\r\nwho refused to bend, and which may be explained by natural causes, but\r\ncannot be judged by moral considerations. The storm cleared the air\r\nand dissipated many a pestilent vapour, but it left a trail of wreck\r\nand ruin over the land. The nation purchased political salvation at\r\nthe price of moral debasement; the individual was sacrificed on the\r\naltar of the State; and popular subservience proved the impossibility\r\nof saving a people from itself. Constitutional guarantees are\r\nworthless without the national will to maintain them; men lightly\r\nabandon what they lightly hold; and, in Henry's reign, the English\r\nspirit of independence burned low in its socket, and love of freedom\r\ngrew cold. The indifference of his subjects to political issues\r\ntempted Henry along the path to tyranny, and despotic power developed\r\nin him features, the repulsiveness of which cannot be concealed by the\r\nmost exquisite art, appealing to the most deep-rooted prejudice. He\r\nturned to his own profit the needs and the faults of his people, as\r\nwell as their national spirit. He sought the greatness of England, (p. 439)\r\nand he spared no toil in the quest; but his labours were spent for no\r\nethical purpose. His aims were selfish; his realm must be strong,\r\nbecause he must be great. He had the strength of a lion, and like a\r\nlion he used it.\r\n\r\nYet it is probable that Henry's personal influence and personal action\r\naverted greater evils than those they provoked. Without him, the storm\r\nof the Reformation would still have burst over England; without him,\r\nit might have been far more terrible. Every drop of blood shed under\r\nHenry VIII. might have been a river under a feebler king. Instead of a\r\nstray execution here and there, conducted always with a scrupulous\r\nregard for legal forms, wars of religion might have desolated the land\r\nand swept away thousands of lives. London saw many a hideous sight in\r\nHenry's reign, but it had no cause to envy the Catholic capitals which\r\nwitnessed the sack of Rome and the massacre of St. Bartholomew; for\r\nall Henry's iniquities, multiplied manifold, would not equal the\r\nvolume of murder and sacrilege wrought at Rome in May, 1527, or at\r\nParis in August, 1572.[1178] From such orgies of violence and crime,\r\nEngland was saved by the strong right arm and the iron will of her\r\nTudor king. \"He is,\" said Wolsey after his fall,[1179] \"a prince of\r\nroyal courage, and he hath a princely heart; and rather than he    (p. 440)\r\nwill miss or want part of his appetite he will hazard the loss of\r\none-half of his kingdom.\" But Henry discerned more clearly than Wolsey\r\nthe nature of the ground on which he stood; by accident, or by design,\r\nhis appetite conformed to potent and permanent forces; and, wherein it\r\ndid not, he was, in spite of Wolsey's remark, content to forgo its\r\ngratification. It was not he, but the Reformation, which put the\r\nkingdoms of Europe to the hazard. The Sphinx propounded her riddle to\r\nall nations alike, and all were required to answer. Should they cleave\r\nto the old, or should they embrace the new? Some pressed forward,\r\nothers held back, and some, to their own confusion, replied in dubious\r\ntones. Surrounded by faint hearts and fearful minds, Henry VIII.\r\nneither faltered nor failed. He ruled in a ruthless age with a\r\nruthless hand, he dealt with a violent crisis by methods of blood and\r\niron, and his measures were crowned with whatever sanction worldly\r\nsuccess can give. He is Machiavelli's _Prince_ in action. He took his\r\nstand on efficiency rather than principle, and symbolised the\r\nprevailing of the gates of Hell. The spiritual welfare of England\r\nentered into his thoughts, if at all, as a minor consideration; but,\r\nfor her peace and material comfort it was well that she had as her\r\nKing, in her hour of need, a man, and a man who counted the cost, who\r\nfaced the risk, and who did with his might whatsoever his hand found\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1178: In three months of \"peace\" in 1568\r\n                   over ten thousand persons are said to have been\r\n                   slain in France (_Cambr.
